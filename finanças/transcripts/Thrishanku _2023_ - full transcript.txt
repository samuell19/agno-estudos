For those who are in love, those who want to fall in love, and those who carry the pain of a broken heart... and for all those who have felt the warmth of love, a warm welcome to another episode of Love Birds. Without wasting much time, let's move on to the first letter. Here's Sethu pouring his heart out to Megha in Mavelikkara. "Oh, my curly-haired princess..." That's how the letter begins! How romantic! "Every time I see you at Brother Laser's Lovebirds shop, I sincerely wish that those love birds mating for life... were you and me! Opening that cage as I soar high into the vast blue sky of love, I look back to see..." - Hello. - Hello... Megha... are you watching the program? Yes, I am. Hey, what kind of rubbish have you written?! I have written much more. I'll tell you in person if you give me a chance. Just keep writing to the TV channel. That's enough for now. As you wish! No problem. As per Sethu's request... Hey! The song is about to start. - You listen to that. - Hello! Hey! Long, long ago I felt a sweet bite Of cotton candy on my tongue You throw glances at me And melt into my heart Hey, take a look Take a glance And listen to my mellow humming Don't run away Let me come along But... it didn't turn out as I had imagined. We can only do so much in a cinema theater, and there are some creeps around. And isn't this your first time? Isn't this your first time?! Yes, it's my first time. I swear on you. The first time is usually like this! You might make some mistakes, as well. It's not like what you see in the movies. - Really? - Yes. Then, it's okay. Yes, it's okay. Listen... Still, I don't feel satisfied. Forget everything. Can I have one more chance? Please... I'll give you that chance over the phone when I call you tonight. Okay? It won't be enough over the phone. Next week, an "offbeat" movie will be released. Shall we go for it? Duh! Don't sweet-talk me Don't beg of me Don't tail me With your sweet lies Oh, my birdie Don't nip at me from within I swear to you You are the love of my life Don't be so clever Don't try to steal my love With your mesmerizing smile Oh, my sweet love There is no dawn without you I am incomplete without you - Hello, Sethu... - Tell me. I am going to the hostel tomorrow, and I want to meet you in person. Where should I come? To the bus stop? No, my dad will be with me. Really? The day after tomorrow is the Onam celebration in college. Then I'll come there. I want to tell you something in person. Brother... Sumi is nagging me. Let me see what it is. Alright, deal! See you in college. You should call home immediately after reaching the hostel. I am going to the estate. The network is really poor there. Get in. Tickets... Tickets... Have you taken the ticket? Nisha, wait for me! First, you go and meet that guy personally. Then tell him you're not interested. I've tried telling him many times. He just wants to make it happen somehow. He's pulling strings through that annoying mom of his. Then tell him about your love affair. Great! Then he'll go and rat on her to her dad. If one goes, another will substitute! If one alliance breaks, another will come up! Her dad's attitude should change first. His go-to phrase for everything is "I know what's best for you, Megha." It's the "Single Parent Syndrome." If things continue like this, I think eloping would be the only option. You... stop giving Telugu film-like ideas. I will... Even though he had voluntary retirement, her father was a Police Superintendent. That's not a position given to any random person. Do you understand? Then what am I supposed to do? Otherwise, you should do it before he finds out. It's risky. - What? - What? Do you mean "this"? You're cheap! What I meant is that you and Sethu should register your marriage as soon as possible. Oh, that... So, what's Sethu's stand? His career is not stable at all. He gave the bank's test and is waiting for the results. No matter the situation, he's there for you, right? Right? Yes. This old hag has lost it! Like, some kind of emotional blackmail. Sethu! Try to understand the seriousness of what I am saying. They will somehow make this happen. Nevertheless, he is an engineer. Unlike you... Unlike me? He's not a so-called "jack-of-all-trades" like you! - Greetings. - Greetings. Here is the payasam. - Payasam? - Do you not like it? I do. My dear Megha, even if I was swimming in money since we're of different religions, your dad will never agree to our marriage. And a registered marriage... I didn't expect it this soon. Can we try to postpone this marriage until your post-graduation is over? I'll definitely have a job by then. Please don't look at me like Caesar looked at Brittas. It's Brutus, not "Brittas." Yeah, the same! Brutus! Don't you know what the situation is? If this is the only way... then let's do it. See, let me tell you something. Leaving home and coming with you on a fine morning isn't challenging for me. However, please don't ask me to return home later. I would rather die than do that. You don't react for the time being. If he locks you down at home, then our communication won't be possible. Don't worry. Let me plan this. Go through the back gate. Payasam. Bye. Such a clown. He has not changed at all. Both you and she will be leaving this place on the upcoming auspicious day. Let's make it happen this coming Sunday. Oh, God! Madhukkarai near Coimbatore. First, I will submit the marriage application to the officer there. You'll go there and spend four days happily, returning with the marriage certificate. He'll assign a date after a month for the marriage registration. Then the challenge lies in ensuring... that you are not caught until the marriage is completed. The route you are going... Or your destination should remain unpredictable. I cannot involve my friends or relatives for sure. He'll go to them first. You know, right? He is a policeman! What's the address? - There is someone there. - Who? A Brahmin guy who studied with me in graduation. Catch the Sivasakthi bus at 5:30 a.m. and arrive at the Kayamkulam Bus Station. The day before that would be a weekend, right? Your dad will be drunk and wasted. He'll wake up only after ten in the morning. That is our grace period. I don't even have a penny on me. Do you have something to lend? Do you see this chain? It used to go all the way to my tummy. It has become this short after I kept lending you guys. If I lend you any more, I'll be choked to death. - Okay. - Get lost! We will catch the Coimbatore Deluxe at 7:30 a.m. and depart. I'll be at the bus station on time. Why can't you come a little early and wait there? If someone sees me, it will raise suspicions. Once you reach the bus station, go to the washroom and pretend to freshen up. Then, come out around 7:15 a.m. I'll have to endure staying in that smelly washroom for so long! This Sunday, both our families will be overwhelmed by the stench. So, it's acceptable to tolerate some stench now. Speaking of which, how will you manage to reach the bus stop during the early, dark hours? That is okay. Britto will be with me. Britto. Britto. Come. Hey girl, where are you going? Do you want a ride? Your food might not be up to par for a while. Okay? It's us who played, and you're sweating. Very good. KAYAMKULAM Britto, go home. Won't you let me sleep in peace?! Oh, God! Are you going to play badminton? Or wrestling? If I don't warm up, I will pull a muscle. And I don't want that. But I saw you going to the bathroom this morning. I am doing yoga, as well. You do yoga only after taking a bath. Display the same enthusiasm during the bank test. What about my health? You shouldn't bother only about your health. - It's hot. - Do one thing, when you come back, get Eladi Lehyam, an Ayurvedic medicine, for Dad. One Kamilari medicine, as well. - I won't go through the medical store. - Take this. Dad will buy it for you. Please buy him one. No, thank you! Even if I were to fall dead here from coughing, nobody should be bothered! Isn't your sister a nurse? She doesn't even know the difference between cough syrup and a pesticide! Don't poke fun at her unnecessarily. It's hardly been a month - since she finished her course. - Course... - I'll go then? - What if I say no? Get lost! Greetings. Does he know how to cycle? Here he comes. Where the hell have you been, loser? Here, take this. Let's go, man. Where has she reached? She's at the bus station. I said I am going to play badminton and got out. Call her and ask where she has reached. She won't be available on the phone. We both haven't taken our phones. We would be in a pickle if her father tracks our SIM and follows us. Exactly! Hey, see this... Isn't this her bus? Oh, God! Go fast... Go! Answer the call from your home or they'll suspect you. Stop the bike. - Hello, Dinesh... - Hello. - Is Sethu with you? - Yes. - His phone isn't connecting. - Mom, tell me. It's me, Sethu. Sethu, come back home quickly. What is it? What happened? ...has left everyone and gone, my son. Left us and gone! Yeah, I'm coming. - There's an issue. - What? It appears that Grandpa has received a visa to Heaven. Take me home quickly. - Is it done? - Yes, almost. Okay, I'll come. The key is here with me, man. Also, inform them that "Linda-de-Mol" will only be available next week. It refers to a specific type of white Anthurium plant, man! - Keep this cash. Okay? - Okay. Sethu! Hey! - Where are they going in such a hurry? - Brother, phone. Yes, Sister? Biju... I am on the way. Hey, your bag! What happened, Uncle? Sethu, come here. Read this. Dad, Mom, and Sethu, I am writing this letter to prevent arguments and fights with all of you. Since we don't have any other option, my friend and I have... decided to get married in the upcoming days. As my friend belongs to a different religion, I can anticipate your responses. I can also predict how far Uncle Chandran would go to prevent this. Mom and Dad, please refrain from searching for me for a few days. Despite his limited education, he is determined to find a way to earn money. I will be safe with him. Yours, Sumi. Neither on Earth nor in Heaven We are strangled in between The scarecrow by the road Entangled is our life, the narrow bridge What a doomed age! Sethu! Hey, Sethu! Are you lost in thoughts?! Come, let's search her room. Move! Go! Nor in Heaven Fall between two stools We are entangled -Neither on Earth -Nor in Heaven -We are strangled -In between Neither on Earth -Nor in Heaven -Mom! -We are strangled in between -In between! SETHU SUMI Magic cup! His damn romantic gift! She took 35,000 rupees from my shelf. Mom, so you had cash with you? Yeah, from the Chit Funds. - Nothing, I was just asking. - Oh, my ill fate! Hey, Sethu. I will be doomed if this marriage takes place. Us too! No matter how hard I try at Perunna headquarters. I will be expelled from my current position in the organization. When I asked her to attend my Bhagavad Gita class at the yoga temple, she had a displeased expression. Damn ants. Hey, your bag. Keep it there. Don't be sad, man. Such is the way of age. Which tree are you going to cut? Tree? For what? To hang me? Calm down, bro. Don't we have to cremate him? What's this? Oh, have you already written the obituary? Whose obituary? Grandpa's... Damn it! Come here. Look there. He's gobbling bananas! Bro, then what's the issue? What happened? Read it, you moron! "Dad, Mom, and Sethu... my friend and I... get married..." Oh, my God! Is it some kind of ritual in your family today, dude? She isn't even 20 yet. If I get hold of that bastard she eloped with... Nice! 20-year-old? What about Megha's age? Such a hypocrite! Oh, God! Megha! Don't be stressed. Keep the bag inside quietly and get out somehow. Then let's go to Megha and tell her everything and come back. No matter what, your plan isn't gonna work today. - I will try to get out somehow. - Okay, let's go. Hey! Put the bag down. Where are you going with your bag? I... - Uncle... - To Coimba... We were planning... - to go on a trip to Kovalam. - Kovalam. -Then we got to know -Kovalam? about the issue here and... Come here. Don't you dare to go around and spread the news that our girl has eloped. If you dare to open your mouth, I'll beat you to a pulp! - Understood? - Okay. I will leave. Your bag will be in the cow shed. No point sitting here and having a family meeting. I'll go to the bus station and check. My sugar level has gone down. I will also obtain the details of inter-state buses. We can take her photo to the inquiry office for information. That's good. I'll also come along. No. You sit here, Uncle. I'll go and ask. No, don't go alone. If you want to give someone a smack, I'd better be by your side! No, Uncle... Hey, can you both stop it? She is not a fool. If she can plan this much, she won't be there at the bus station waiting for you. So what are you suggesting? She ran away with her college boyfriend, right? - Yes. - So, we should check her college in Mangalore first. Got it? It is also mentioned in the letter that we shouldn't bother searching in Kerala. How kind of her! Then what do we do? What else? Sethu and I will take the next flight to Mangalore. - Awesome! - I didn't hear you. Flight? Dear brother, you've never seen the world beyond this village! What are you going to do in Mangalore? I and Sethu will go. Anyhow, I am more efficient than you. Oh! Is that why you caused a ruckus last week in the tea shop, arguing that Bhutan is not a country but the name of a lottery ticket? What's the need? There is an express bus to Mangalore from the bus station at 8:00 a.m. - Yes. - She used to take that bus. It will reach quickly. - But... - No matter how... I want my child back! All four of us can go. No, Brother-in-law. Didn't the doctor tell you not to travel? We three will go. Is that the issue here?! Don't worry, Dad. It's not that easy for a couple to get married in a far-off place. It will follow its course, involving numerous legal formalities. Hey, where did you learn all this? No, I have studied the Marriage Act for the PSC examination. - Marriage Act? - Okay. Brother-in-law, you stay here. Devaki and your dad are alone here. Also, if she has a change of mind and comes back, you should be here. You go pack your bag. I'll go home and get ready in ten minutes. Oh, mine is already packed. - Go fast! - Yes. - I have traveled on flights, okay? - Yeah, right! Stupid girl! Are you ready yet? Come and get in the rickshaw. Move, man. Mangl... Hey, this... - Look out, you! - Move aside. - Where is this bus going, man? - What? Oh, sorry... Sir, where is this bus going? Can't you read the board? To Mangalore. So... Mangalapuram?! Both are the same. It's written in Malayalam too. Oh, yes. My hearing is a bit slow, so I couldn't read it. Wait! Six plus four plus five plus two is seventeen. 1+7 = 8. Oh, God! Let's take another bus! My dear brother! This bus will leave now. You and your superstitions! Get inside. Sethu, come. Mr. Atheist Biju! You better not look down upon the Lord above. Isn't it your superstition that this bus won't break down on the way? Otherwise, you're not going to remove the engine and check to make sure, right? The faith that you have kept in this 1997 model bus, I have kept the same in God... That's it. Oh... this doesn't even fit in. Hey! Get up and go back. I feel nauseous if I don't sit by the window. Get up and go - Oh, I forgot that. - Go. Keep your bag somewhere on the top. He's hugging it as if it's his girlfriend! Alright, tell them to start the bus. They will start when it's time. Just calm down. Damn! It's scorching hot! Couldn't you find an AC bus? You both sit here. - I'll go get something to eat and drink. - Okay. Can't say where they will stop next. No! You stay here. The bus will leave now. What's wrong with you? This is not a flight. They'll stop if somebody has to get in. You go and get it. He has diabetes. You are the one who is spoiling him. Don't start shivering if your blood sugar level drops. My foot! Sorry, brother. - What's happening, Sethu? - Come here. Megha, sorry. We might have to drop the plan for now. Sumi has left a note and eloped with some guy in the morning. What? My uncles and I are going to look for her. We can go after I solve this. You go home for now. I'll explain in detail later. You go home for now. Se... Sethu... Where is it? There. Who? Where are the biscuits and water? Oh... those weren't available in the shop. Not available? Good for nothing fellow! COIMBATORE Let's go. It is a bad omen. He drove backward! Hey! Hey, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Were you planning to die or something? Move aside. - Move aside. - I told you we should go by flight! Such a nuisance! MANGALORE KOLLAM - Yours is a reserved ticket? - Yes. - Where do you wanna go? - Where are they going? Hey... Brother... Oh! Let it be... I didn't ask you anything. Take this. What is the last stop of this bus? It's till Mangalore. So you got in without reading the board? You just need the cash, right? Give me a ticket to Mangalore. Yeah, I just need the cash. I'll give you the change when you get down. Give me a cigarette. Here's the change. No. Oh, so he smokes?! That too in public! He'll have to... Such is the situation! Sit and watch. You were her mediator, weren't you? When you stood by her to support her in everything, why didn't you, her Lakshman uncle, come to know about this? Yes?! See, she has landed herself in trouble. We can't delay anymore. You call Manoj from the Cyber Cell. And get all the necessary details. Sir. I don't think the bus will move an inch without proper repair. I warned you when I heard some faulty noise from the rear axle. It's not that. It will only take ten minutes, I have informed the depot. I am an old Mechanical Engineering graduate. Move away. Also, don't keep us all waiting, and better get another bus from the depot. People have very less value for others' time. I am speaking for everyone. - Come, bro... come, everyone. - It will be here. I have to reach before my night shift. Oh! You're still on call? Hello? What's happening? We have been waiting for so long. - Where is the other bus? - It'll come now. - When? - I am talking to them only. - Hey, stop blabbering. The bus is here. - Where? What is it? Is it an 'Ordinary' bus? They are stopping everywhere! Our bus broke down. Ladies first. - How many people can you accommodate? - Only five people. - Okay, then take them along. - Let's go. Get in. Only five people can go to this. Did you inform the depot? - Did you call them? - Yes, I have. Hey... Bro... Sethu... What a surprise?! Hey, Franko! It's been a while, man! I didn't notice you as I was looking out. Yeah, I understood. That's why I called. You're full-on tripping, yes? Nothing like that! Oh, Lord! Oh, both of you are here? Yes. They are my uncles. Why are you standing? Go take a seat. There are seats in the back. I'll go and sit there. You keep looking outside. It's fascinating. Who's this hippie? He's my classmate. He's a nuisance if he starts talking. He won't stop. Do you recognize me? - I'm Franko. It's been a while. - Oh, yeah. I think I have an upset stomach. Let me see if there is any tablet. You're just being anxious. That... Sethu... So, what do you want me to do? So, you two are... - Yeah, we broke up. - Oh, really?! I mean... I'm so... so sad. So that's why he's sulking! Hey, you come and sit. Get a lemon to sniff from, at the next stop. That would be enough. No, it's there. Let me see. Megha, you stay confident. I am here for you. Don't take any stress. Take rest. - Come and sit, man! - Yeah. Sir, we are in front of his house. According to the internet history, I'm pretty sure that it's him. Still, you just confirm that. Yes, sir. Is anyone here? Devaki... - What is it? - See that. Oh, no! Dad, what are you up to so early in the morning? The sun is shining upon us! Who are you? - We are from the village office. - What are you doing, Dad? I am sad. I feel miserable! I know. Let go of me. Tell me the names and details of the members of your family. What? We are here to take a census. Wasn't there another census conducted recently? - Now, what is this census about? - This is different. This is a part of building new toilets for all the houses that don't have one in our village. We have toilets here. You're misunderstanding. - We have to file a report. - Did you take it from my room? Try to understand - the situation and behave, Dad! - Just go! Dad, if the bottle breaks and you get hurt there is no one here to take you to the hospital. Give it to me, for heaven's sake. Get lost! Dad, just stop it. Leave it. What's your name? My name is Sahadevan. Go. Get lost! - How many members are in the house? - Do what you want. Five people. Me, my wife, son, daughter, and father, as well. Call everyone. They need to sign this form. I won't give... I won't give it! What?! Why does everyone need to sign to build a toilet? Also, my son is not here. He is out... Where did he go? He went to a wedding. Hey, Sahadeva... Who's marriage? Yes? Didn't he say that... since they are of different religions it's not easy to register?! Didn't he?! Dad, please be quiet. Sethu, come, let's freshen up. I am not coming. You both go. I am not going anywhere. I have a severe headache. I'm traveling so far after a long time. Anyway, I am going. I'll also come. Okay, come. Come. I'll go to the toilet and come. - Need to pee. - Shall I accompany you? No need, I can go alone. I'm not giving you company, I also want to pee. If somebody wants to pee while traveling, we also feel like peeing. Weird, right?! Come. Oh! Thank God! It's clean! - Don't you wanna pee? - Yeah, I'm coming. Water. Water. You come here. I want to tell you something. Take your hands off me! You guys, please stop fighting. What fight?! Try not to escalate the problem. - You both please be chill. - What do I be chill about?! See, Megha is chill. I'll take care of the rest. Come, get in. - Take your hands off me? Are you insane? - Get in, bro. - Megha, have some sweets. - Just get lost! You don't like sweets? You come here. Oh, God! Come, sit here. Whatever... Whatever the problem is, I'll sort it out. Otherwise, what's the point of being your friend? You sit here. I'll be back. What is his problem? Nothing, he is a nut case. You have nice friends! Oh! My dear Megha! I'll handle him till we reach Mangalore. Get aside, bloody pesterer! It's normal after a breakup. You'll be mad. But you'll be fine. Megha, walk fast. Hey, the bus is starting. Where is Biju? - Oh! - Go and check. Sethu... Hey... Is anyone there?! Come out... Who did this? No clue. - Go, go. - Hey, stop! Stop, please! Oh my God. - Is this your ten minutes?! - What shall I say, brother?! Sethu, where were you? Where were you, Uncle? Some rascal locked me inside. - Then what happened? - Then what? Another rascal let me out. Otherwise, I would have missed the bus. Very strange people! Sir, I've got it. We can use it if there is no other way. Otherwise... You take a copy of this and send it to S.I Mallappa. Yes, sir. - Now, straight to Mangalore? - Yes. Climbing the bridge of troubles And Jumping into the whirlpool Sharpening your eyes and ears Who are you searching for? Elsewhere in a faraway land When the thunderstorm gathers You venture into the search Who are you looking for? Oh you, firefly Let me ask thy Did you see a sign Of my naughty little bird? Crossing the darkness of night You elope escaping all Oh you, my chatterbox beauty You give an answer Where are you, baby? Your mom is on the call. - Hello... - Give it to me. - Hello... - Not audible. I'll call you when we reach. We have reached Mangalore. - What? - Mangalapuram... What? Oh, God. We have reached Mangalore. Talk softly! I can hear. Oh, everyone heard. Please, come now. MANGALAPURAM We have reached Mangalore. Don't forget your bags on the bus. Oh, we know we have reached Mangalore. You don't have to repeat it. Hey. Come, let's go there and see. - It's... - Yeah, let's go. - Megha, do you want me to hold your bag? - No. - Anything else? - No. What should we do now?! What else? Let's take an auto-rickshaw and go. Okay then, let's go. Megha... Rickshaw... Can we go together if we are going in the same direction? - Where are you going? - Kudroli. Oh! You are going there? Then come. Oh, God! Really? Okay... Excuse me... This Shetty... What, sir? Hey, you come and talk. You get inside first. You don't even know the language. Where to, sir? Brother, this... Dr. Shetty College... Kadri... - Yes... - Please, drop us there. - Yes, sir. Please, sit. - Okay. Megha, get rid of him. - See, there's a rickshaw coming. - Hey, stop. Stop... Come, get inside. Megha, aren't you coming? - No, I am going on a different route. - So, I... - Brother, take him, quick. - Which route? - Stop, stop. - Bye. - Brother. - Yes? - Brother, just follow that auto-rickshaw. - Okay. - Where has he gone? - Where is he? - Where were you?! - Everyone is charging too much. - Are you fooling around? - Brother... - Let's go. - Shetty College, right? Go... Take... Damn it, whatever the language is... Bloody Mangalore! I had told her many times that... I'll get an admission for her... in the Pandalam NSS College. - Brother, please go a little faster. - Yes. He'll tell us when we are about to reach. Don't get so restless. Yes, there! Stop, stop. What is this garage? Oh, Uncle, this place doesn't look safe for a family to stay. Let's go a bit further and look for a better place. What family? It's just the three of us. I'll make sure that no one rapes you here. Also, it's cheaper here. Come, it'll be fine. We could find a decent hotel if we search a bit more. What's the point of saying it now? Let's go and search, then. This is nearer to the college. Do you want me to search for a 5-star hotel at this hour? - Come here. - Oh, God. - He'll keep blabbering like this. - Let's go. I'm very sleepy. Come. Madam, are you going to stay in this lodge? Hotel Dreams is nearby. Do you want to go there? No, it's okay. Who cares about dreams? - Your room is upstairs. 104. - Okay. Sir, just a minute. This? Didn't you understand? It means we can forget about sleeping tonight! Oh. - Come, let's go. - Let's go. They don't even have a lift. I think the Onam festival has reached here late! It's Dussehra, not Onam. Once Navaratri starts, it will be a celebration here for the next ten days. These guys are not like our village performers, they are real gym brats! Oh, gym brat, my foot! Oh, is this our room? Excuse me. Need one room. Name? What? Name and address. Brother, a clean room, please. Please. Deluxe room! This is special for deluxe. Sethu? Do you want to take a shower? - You go, Uncle. I'll take a shower later. - Okay. Look at the way he's sleeping. Just like a log! In Perunna... You bloody outsider, how dare you act smart in our area? Area?! Do you own this whole area?! There's no such thing! Don't you dare come to our area and argue with us! - Hold him! - Beat him! Hey, close the gate! He shouldn't run away! Hey, come! Here he is! Oh, sorry! Thank you, brother. Hey! Come with us! Let's go! Hey, who is that girl? I have no idea, bro. She is gorgeous, bro. Damn! Megha! What do you think you're doing?! I trusted you. We had decided on this together. Please don't shout! I asked you to go back home, didn't I? What shall we do now? How can I go back home after all this, Sethu? This was the only option we had. Didn't you say your family would understand us? Go tell your uncles about us then. I'm tired of compromising my life for others. If you can't tell them, I will do it. Dear Megha... if you tell them about this now, they will unanimously make a decision for the first time in their lives. I'll be taken back home in an icebox. Sir. Ice water. Okay. What are you staring at? Leave now. Go away! Hold this. There are all sorts of junkies here! I can't think of anything right now. Just give me one more night. I'll figure something out. Do what you want, but if you can't figure it out by morning I'll tell your uncles everything. I am serious. That wouldn't be necessary. I'll come and meet you early morning before they wake up. Take rest now. Uncle Biju will step out anytime now. Megha. Don't worry. We will figure out a way. Just lock the door and sleep for now. Don't open the door if anybody knocks. Also, you don't have your phone, right? Phone... Yes. Lock it properly. What kind of dosa is this?! We ordered dosa and got an omelet! - It must be an egg dosa! - Sethu, why aren't you eating? I can't eat with this fork and everything. What is he looking at? Come on, eat it. Do what you want! I'll tell your uncles everything. I am serious. Sethu. Don't you recognize me? I'm Sumi's college friend, Megha. Yeah... Sumi's college friend, Megha. Uncle, she is Sumi's close friend. Hi, uncle. Hi. Uncle! That's a healthy drink! I didn't know if she would drink tea or not. Oh! Here. - Is this also a healthy drink? - No. Thank you! No problem. What you told me is unbelievable! She never said anything about this. What shall we do now? What else? We will head straight to the college! - That's it. - Yes. I am also going there. My fees are due. I need to pay them. - Otherwise, I will not get my certificate. - Oh. In that case... Hey, ask her... Megha, if you don't mind, can we also come to college with you? Since you know the college well, it will be easier for us. I don't mind at all. No problem! Come, let's go to the college. Uncle. Good idea! Thank God! - Come, Rekha. - She's not Rekha, but Megha! That's what I said, Megha! This girl seems familiar. Dear... Were you on the bus we took yesterday? No way! Come on! I... I've seen her... She looks familiar. I also boarded the bus yesterday from my hometown. The Kayamkulam Express! Yes! That's why she looks familiar to me! - Were you there on the bus? - Yeah! - See, I told you! - Okay. Shall we go? Hey, rickshaw! Hand me the register. The register... Third floor. Shall we... go to the shopping mall? I didn't carry a lot of clothes as I came in haste. You also wanted to buy something, right? Yeah, something... You have cash with you, right?! There is some issue with my card. Yes! It's there. Go and take a shower first. - I'll get ready. - Yes, I'll go. A Benz C-class car! Kerala registration vehicle! - See... - What? A Vintage model car! - Oh, God! Move aside! - What?! What's wrong? He is from my hometown. He's a cop! Hey, no! It must be someone else! No! I am damn sure. He had once come to inaugurate the library near my house. - We're screwed, I guess! - Damn it! Okay, we will do one thing. Let me go there and check once. You pack our things and keep everything ready. - Okay. - Go in. Hey mister, get me the guest register. - Sir?! - We are from Kerala Police, man. Get it. Did a young couple take a room here yesterday? They're Malayalis. - What?! Malayali couple?! - Oh! Shit! See, this is the girl. Hey, you were right! They came looking for us. Hurry up. No clue, sir. A different receptionist was here yesterday. I came in for the morning shift. Come fast. There's a Malayali couple in room number 204. - Will you hurry up? - Yes. Your family has strong connections with the cops, right? Yes. What's wrong, sir? Oh, no! I forgot my sunglasses! Just leave it! It must be in the bag. Come, let's go! Stop hanging on to my hand. Just run! Hurry up! Hurry up, my foot! I couldn't even wear my underwear! Sir, this is his family. Anyway, it's good that you came with us. After all, this is your college! We won't need to ask anyone for directions! Brother, let's inquire about the boy first. - Okay. - Where's the Principal's room? - Straight ahead! - Straight? Okay. Come, this way. It's there. I mean, go straight and then turn left. - This way? - Yes. - Here?! - Yeah. Fear not. They are stupid. Come. Now, where is the principal from?! How does it matter, when all you know is Malayalam?! It's been six years! He hasn't even cleared his first year's arrears! This is the first time that anyone has come here looking for Alex since the course started. Anyways, you should pay the entire fine for all the losses he caused in the college. 76,000 rupees. - What?! - What? This is for letting the snake loose in the warden's bathroom. And this is for deflating my car tires. - Yes! - Sir, happy Dussehra. Happy Dussehra. - Sir, it's time for the meeting. - Yeah. Give it to them. No, we're good. My sugar level shouldn't go down! -Sir, -Yes. We aren't his family members. He came here after causing a lot of trouble in our town, as well. So, we came to inquire about it. Oh! So that's it! Then, this is not the right place. He hardly attends college. Oh, no. Some of his friends are here in the college Hostel. Maybe, they'll have some information about him. Okay, sir. So go right from here and... Don't worry, sir. We'll figure out the directions. She's a student here, after all! Oh, okay. You... - Which batch?! - Can I... Can I pay the hostel fees at the counter here? Yeah, yeah. You should pay it in the account section only. - You'll pay the whole amount, right? - Sure, sir. Oh! Good, good! When do you have to go back? That... Are you used to traveling alone at night? This is how you get used to doing things, after all! Oh, God! Are you Joju? Go and ask that bat on the sofa. Look at him! - Ask the guy sitting there studying. - Wait here. Awesome! Son, are you Alex's friend? Alex?! Who's Alex?! Alex Jacob. Oh! That could be our guy, the Philanderer! Oh! Philanderer! Philanderer?! What's that? That means your niece has eloped with a player! - Where is he now? - Good lord! It's been three or four months since I saw him! By the way, who told you that I am his friend? What's the matter?! Are you the police? Dear son, we are not from the police, military, or anything! No, even if you're, we don't give a damn! All the policemen here are our buddies. They come here from time to time looking for him. We often chill together. Dear children, If you know of any place where he might go, please let us know. We cannot go back without seeing him. If you're that desperate... you will have to go to the pub. But that place is filled with his stoner gangs. What's that now? That means... people who take cocaine and weed! - Oh, no! - You can go there. But if you create any trouble, they'll smash you all up! - Oh, no! - That's true! Bro, we're ready to take any risk. We're in such a situation! Please give us the location. Yeah, sure. G-Pub in Balmatta. Today is Tuesday night, right? So, only couples will be allowed, right? Oh. But they can go in. Yeah, they can go. But if you go there wearing a loincloth and all they'll kick you out of there! Wear western clothes, like jeans or pants. - Okay? - Don't be too formal or too casual. Now they know that without your help, nothing will work out! Okay, bye. - Uncle, Megha is leaving, it seems. - Yes? I'll leave now... - Okay. - But... No, dear, don't travel alone at this odd time. It's very late. Oh, that's fine, this is how we get used to it, right?! That's true, but... Just a minute, please. Dear, please don't say no. We are not that close to you and shouldn't ask for such a favor. I know that. But you heard those boys, right? Only couples will be allowed to enter! Now we don't want to go looking for a girl and get beaten up by the natives! Dear, you are Sumi's classmate, right? At least for her sake, can you please do this favor? - Can you? - Yes. Yeah, okay. - Okay, then. Come, let's go. - Come. Let's go. SHALL WE MEET FOR A COFFEE? ARE YOU FREE? HEY... SEND YOUR WHATSAPP NUMBER. I'LL CALL YOU Don't worry, dear. - It won't take more than a day... - Sir... A message was received on your daughter's phone. Franko! Is this for real?! Is he that big of a mess?! Yeah! Of course! He has proposed to me several times under the pretext of ragging! He has an innocent face. That's why these naive girls fall for him. Well, some guys are like that! Come, Sir. Come, Madam. Come. - Is that what you call an innocent face?! - Sir, come. - Come, sir. - I have seen his face on the mug. - He looks like a crook! - Come, sir. - What do you want, sir? - Two T-shirts in size 46. Something that can be worn in clubs. Megha, can you say it in their language? - Brother, I understood. - Oh. Aren't you guys not buying any clothes? Our type of clothes is available in that shop. - We'll go and buy from there. - Let me go and see. Take this, sir. Look. Uncles aren't around right now and these guys don't know our language. If you want to curse me, take a shot! Why?! Look, I came uninvited with you yesterday. It was not only for me. Megha, I swear on God... I would have eloped with you at that moment! But you also heard about Alex, right?! Please stand by me until I find Sumi. Sethu, Sumi is like a sister to me. Finding Sumi is my concern, as well. Now even if you take me to your home without Sumi nothing will work out there, I know. I have that much sense. - Brother, pack this for me. - Okay. - Don't you need anything, Madam? - No, no. - Okay. - I can wear any dress I have. No, bro. She needs a dress. I can't even remember the last time I bought you something. Hey! Your uncles will see us. Let them go to hell! Bro, pack this. What are you saying? Where should we go now?! When I said to take the necessary things I meant the cash, not your damn clothes! It slipped my mind in that rush. Slipped your mind, is it?! Now wherever we go and stay, this will be our situation! Mangalore is not a big city. They can spot us easily if they try. That's why I am saying, come, let's go to my friends. Your friends?! Don't make me speak about them! Come on! It's just a matter of a night! - Then, we can plan for tomorrow... - Oh, God! Alex! Do you have a single sober friend in this city? Listen, don't pester me with your damn dialogues! I am going there anyway. You suit yourself! Or wait on the Highway. You might get a lift to go back home! Are you coming or not? Megha is walking towards me, while I'm sitting here! No! Not that! She's walking, and I'm sitting here... And I slowly... Who's this prick in black?! Listen... Here you go... This seat is reserved! Hey, Megha. Reached the cafe. Where are you? With four question marks! What about a heart emoji? No, will give her the heart in person! Hey, Megha, where are you and the four question marks?! Screen share?! Are you a hacker or her father? Oh, God! Uncle... She said they broke up. What else would I ask her then? You...! Don't try to play tricks on me! No, tricks! Trust me, I am telling the truth! On top of that, she was sitting away from him and his uncles on the bus. That's all I know! - Uncles?! - Let go of me! Lakshmanan... Don't wait, just get all their details! After all, she's our girl! Hey, Sachin... Don't keep moving. Stand properly with your legs apart! No matter how much I say, you will not understand! What? Make way... Make way! Who's that girl? What?! The girl! Who's that girl? A girl! You were wandering here and there at night. What is he saying?! Move aside! - Uncle... - What? Megha is here! Dear, come inside How did you reach here? - A friend dropped me here. - Okay. How's our new look?! This is very difficult to put on. It almost feels like you're standing inside a PVC pipe! How do you guys manage to wear all this? I know who's responsible for this! Okay, I will put on this cap, as well. It will make me look younger. If that's the purpose, you may need a helmet! Hey, you! Are you done mocking me?! Most probably only the two of us would be allowed inside the club. Oh! Will all this fancy dressing go in vain? No matter what, we need to gather some information about Sumi and the guy. In the meantime, you both try to get into that club somehow. If the guys in the hostel were right, it's risky. In case, if they are there in the Pub, and we can't enter then you should go and convince Sumi and bring her outside. Well, give me your phone number. I'll call if there is any need. I don't have a mobile phone, uncle. A girl without a mobile phone in this era?! Now that's called a well-brought-up girl. Let's leave then. No matter what, we will come back with Sumi, okay? Ra ra raama dapper maama Here's the peppy dance tune Hey come, mama, darling mama Let's shake a leg to this tune Mangalore is asking Did you have fun here? Oh, my dear friend Come, get lost In the darkness of this street Hey hey maama super maama Here's our story of trauma Beat the drums Let's party the whole night Megha, let me buy you Mangalore's special Kori roti! I love rotis a lot! Hence... Have you ever tried Kongini idli? I will mix them and feed them to you at the station today. I'll make it special for you! Sir, enough poking me. Now please collect that senior uncle's number, please! - Chill, man! - But... We will get the number soon. Hey, what did I do? Let go of me! I couldn't zip it up. My brother! You bought this jacket for 150 rupees! This is likely to happen then! Just take it off. We don't need it here! I said, take it off! What to do with this now? Just keep it somewhere. See, we need to get inside. Stand by me like a pillar, okay? Yes, okay. Hey, see that. - Get in. - Thank you. Don't turn around. Walk forward. Did you notice that? - Maybe that's how people behave here. - Really? Let's copy them. That's it! - Leave that jacket and come! - Oh, yes. What's happening here?! - Let's go and search. - We're going. - Okay. - You both search that side. But why did they let us in? As if they will only allow couples! I guess, those boys were just bragging! What did you say? Let's go! Bro, that stuff's name was something weird. After having that, I was like, "Catch this guy! No, that guy." That was some trippy stuff, bro! Do their parents have no control over them? They have set them free to utter chaos! Disgusting! What's the matter with you, boy?! No, no! Stay away! Oh, my God! Hey! Hey, Biju! Hey Biju! Biju! Oh, God! Come here, Biju! I said, come here! Damn! Biju, are you out of your mind? What the hell... Just join me! Or else, they will doubt us! What?! Just shake a leg with me! Or else, the other people will suspect us! See, he is watching us! Shake a leg! Hop! Hop! Yeah, we will jump and search! Don't stop! - Hop! Hop! - In this old age... What happened? Where are my uncles? Oh, no! Good God! Am I gonna die? What? - Hello. - Hello? Hello. Hello. Hello. Stop that! Hello? The call got disconnected! Is there any pub where a party takes place today? I... Today is Tuesday, right? Then G-Pub, Balmatta! Balmatta! Where's it? From here... straight... Sir, it's Balmatta. Call Mallappa. Get the hell out! Oh, God! Give me my coat! Here! - Get lost! - Seriously? You get lost! Hey. Get up! Please get up, Alex! It's all messed up here. Please listen, shouldn't we leave tomorrow? We... Hey, Malli... Hey! Hey, you! You idiot! Listen to me! Yeah, Malli. I am saying it for the last time. This is not a damn joke, Alex! If you... If you don't come with me right now, I'll go alone from here. Malli, I love you! Oh, my God. - What happened, babe? - I am leaving! Listen, I am leaving! Damn it! Move! All men are dogs! Bloody dogs! - Excuse me. - Yes, sir? Do you know Alex? Sumi? Sumi. Hey, why are you crying? I blindly trusted that prick. I hurt my family! I deserve this! We'll sort it out. Stop crying. Bro... Hey! How do you know my name? I came here with Sethu and your uncles. They're all inside. They're here?! Yeah. But you don't need to worry. They won't do anything to you. They have been looking for you for the last two days. I was also with them. By the way, where is Alex? Tell me, where is Sumi? - I'll smack your face off! - Sumi... Tell me! Sumi... I love you! - Open your eyes. - Hello? - What's happening, bro? - Get lost! Are they all mad at me? They'll calm down if you just go and hug them. Anyway, don't let the uncles know that you're here. - I'll go and get Sethu. - Okay. But... you are? If anyone asks, tell them that I am your classmate. What the hell? Leave my hand. Leave my hand! Robin is waiting at the station. Come. Damn it! I came on my own and I am not going back. They have a warrant. Come. Oh, God! How dare you misbehave with her?! Bloody dog! Oh, no! Don't hit him! He's a cop. A cop?! Sir? Bloody... Move! Thank God. It is nothing serious. Hello. I mean, sorry. Oh, no! Sethu? What the hell is going on, man? Let go of my hand. - Get all of them to the station. - Yes, sir. - Sir, it was a mistake. - Come! - See Sumi's here... - Let's go! Sumi... Dear Sumi! What the hell is going on? Who are they? Take them to the jeep. Walk! - But... Sumi! - Sumi. Dear! MANGALORE EAST POLICE STATION What did you think? If you go out of state, you can fool me for long? Take your hands off! How dare you touch my boy?! I don't care if you are a cop! What do you expect me to do with the person who ran off with my daughter? If needed I will take his head off! Daughter?! Who's your daughter?! Megha?! He's Megha's Dad. So what? Megha, come. Let's go home. Sir, she is not coming with you. We have taken this decision together. Sethu. Also, there are laws like Special Marriage Act that favor us. Are you teaching the law to a cop?! Well, your law points are correct! But this case won't come under SMA. I'm here with a Kerala police officer to legally arrest my daughter for stealing my money, gold, and eloping. I will present her at the police station where the crime has happened. Give that warrant. Give it! Do you want to read it? But you haven't found any gold with her. Yes, I did. Anyway, I am taking her. Dear, you don't have a choice. We'll discuss this once we reach home. Thank you, Mr. Mallapa. Come. - I said, come! - Let me go. Come. Sethu... Sethu, what's happening here? Don't you understand? All this time they were fooling us! Come! We will discuss the rest at home. Hey, wait! Are you going to go just like that?! Hey, see this! Oh, no! Sir! - Look here. - Sir. It could be for the first time in history, that someone is eloping with his two uncles accompanying him! I appreciate your courage! There's no point in cursing Sumi now. You both are two peas in a pod! Uncle, I told you. I had no other option. Don't utter a word! - What a mess! - Oh, God! My family is filled with such lovesick people! Why are you quiet?! Go, talk to him. Look at him standing like a stone! Sethu, You could have at least given me a hint. I would have supported you. What do you mean? You're not pissed because he fooled us, but because the girl is a Christian, right? Our family used to have an elephant at home. So what?! This means, our families were that prestigious... Sorry, sir. Sorry. What about our family's prestige and pride? The pride of the family should be proved by living well. Not like this! Sethu, you know what? I came here to find Sumi and the guy and get them married. But what can we do? He's a fraud! Oh! So you both are on the same team! I was such a fool to trust you guys! Now what?! To sum it up, his girlfriend went home with her dad. His sister is in the pub with that wicked guy! And we three are in jail! Are you happy?! First, let's think about how we can get out of here. - There's only one way... - What? We need to bribe them. They'll fall head over heels for money. Good idea! Hindering a police officer on duty! Upon that, attempt to murder! - Attempt to murder?! - Yes No one has ever died out of a slap! If it had gone a bit down, there's a weak point on the neck. He would have died from that. What weak point? No clue, right? There are such things! Since we are just the accomplices, we could get a maximum imprisonment of two years. But him, he'll be screwed for five years! You better learn Kannada. Man, you have slapped a Sub Inspector. They can falsely accuse you of various other crimes and make it a strong case. Do you get it? I don't think we have enough money to get away from all this. Don't be pessimistic. Just check, how much do you have. - Sethu, how much do you have? - All in all, 2000 rupees. That's the maximum I have, as well. What about you? I have nothing. I only had that bag with me, and that also has been confiscated by them. Sethu, Move here and cover for me. See, I have this engagement ring with me. Take this. You also take off your chain. My chain? You won't have anything if you are sent to jail, not even your name! Instead, your identity will be a fancy number. If you don't want that to happen take off that chain. Yes, take it. It has come down to this. Don't expect my specs and hearing aid! - That's not needed. - Yeah. Keep the money. Come on, quick! Pack it. Now call him. Sir? Sir? Just a minute. - What? - Please, let us go. I don't understand your damn English. Speak in Malayalam. I can understand bits of it. - Sir, it was a misunderstanding. - True that. Misunderstanding?! Do you know who that is? Sub-Inspector of Karnataka police! You slapped him and you call it a mistake? Sir, SI sir was not in uniform, right? That too in a pub. It really is a misunderstanding. Why would we dare to touch you, people? That's true. See him. He is pissed at you. You'll have to bear the consequences. Sir, it'll be a disgrace, if the public gets to know that an efficient police officer has been beaten up. Yes, that too by a dumb guy from Kerala! Yes. Sir, and if the media gets to know about it... it'll be a shame for the entire Karnataka Police. That's true. Please, we will do anything. Okay. You wait. What? I'll go talk to him and see. You'll have to give whatever amount he asks for. - Sure, we will pay any amount he asks for! - We will. - Yes. - Okay. Shit! Now this is what I am doing! He is going to set us free. Uncle, I don't think so. He's going to hit me. Will it work out? Let's see. I don't think we have enough cash. Do you have any hidden jewelry? Like a waist chain or something? Shut up! I don't have anything. Yes, he is coming. -Sir is very strict -Oh... Somehow I have managed to convince him. Don't go for any negotiation! No. Tell us, how much is it? Five lakhs?! Shut up! Let him speak. - How much?! - Five hundred plus 100. And that extra 100 is for me. How much did you say?! Five hundred plus 100. A total of 600 rupees. Not a penny less. If you can't give then... No, it's fine. We'll give, sir. - Okay. - Give it. Hurry up. - Don't give everything. - Here. Then one more thing, SI wants to slap him back. Sir, we will give you an additional 500 rupees. Can I avoid the slap? It's just a slap, right? Let him be happy! It'll be alright. - Yes, he agreed, he's okay with it. - Okay. Okay? - Let's go. - Just get one slap, man! What if you come to your senses then? - Oh, God! - Get lost, you fool! Shut up, let's leave. Go! Had I known this, I would have tipped him ten rupees extra. Wait, I am coming. MANGALORE EAST POLICE STATION - Brother, here. - What a day! Brother. - Sumi?! - Brother! My girl! Give me the bag, dear. Please don't scold me. I made a mistake. - It's okay. - Sorry. It's all in the past. - She came back without any trouble. - Yes. Let it go. It's alright. You understood everything, right? That's enough. Let me ask you something, dear. There are many men in this world. And you fell for that scoundrel? Be quiet, brother. She is already shattered. Don't hurt her anymore. I'm not saying anything! You all are together in this. Come. Let's catch the next bus home. - We have been wandering for two days now. - Come. No. You go home with her. I can't leave Megha as he left her. He is back to Megha! Is he a fool? She's been arrested. It will be a huge case if you try to save her. They can't give me capital punishment, right? - Hey... - No, Uncle. I don't know what will happen. This is my last chance. I can understand what you are saying. But it's a huge risk to take such an impulsive stance now. Please, listen to me now. Are you listening? What is it? Did you all beat him up? Why? Sir, who is he? I don't know anything, sir. We were just dancing in tiger costumes. Sir, don't believe him. He's lying. They called me from home and beat me like a dog in the lodge. Subrahmanian... if there is no witness, nothing is possible. There is a witness, sir. There is a guy standing outside. He's seen him beating me. Hey, call him in. Okay, sir. - I want to think about a plan. - Hey. Come inside. Sir is calling you. - Come. - You alone. Go. Did you see them beating him? Didn't you understand? Did you see him beating him in the lodge? - Thank you, Brother. - Sir, help me. No. I didn't see them. - Can I go now? - No? Should we go inside and see? Didn't you get enough? Need another slap? Sorry, Subrahmanian. I can't do anything. Don't keep fighting in this matter. You may end up in trouble. You all leave. - Thank you, sir. - Okay. What did they ask? It's about some issue that happened in the lodge yesterday. - Move. - Thank you, brother. Come, let's go party. Do you want anything? What? Any help? Do you know them? No. I saw them yesterday. - At the lodge. - Oh! At the lodge. Come. Let's go, dear. Dear, are you okay? - My dear. - Yes? Let's go home and... find a good job for you. Listen to me! You get a job and we can think about the rest. Am I right? For sure, Uncle. I'll definitely get a job. No matter how much I struggle, I'll pay your debt first. - Debt? - Our debt? What debt? This debt! Hey, Sethu! Hey, stop! - Brother, let him go. - Boss! -If he can do this much alone, -Boss! he won't come back home without her. Stop! The games we played are coming again Like a boomerang Stop, please! When try to meet the ends It drifts away again I need help. In the heaven of confusion Carrying a cross, he jumps into a pit Holding a thread of hope He tries to escape When he runs Drenched in colors Oh, the smartie pie, tell me Leave "whys" Leave "whats" Go search for her beyond every question Oh, God! Chill down my heart What to do? Let me try running Where to search Left and right Oh, God! Oh, God! Yes, what is it? Where are you? I am at the auto-rickshaw stand. Tell me, brother. A girl has been taken in a Kerala registration vehicle. Search for the girl! Trace out the car! The car's color is blue. - Tell me, bro. - Ask for the address. - Hello. - Check all the cars. Drink. Call him. Hey, you understood everything, right? Don't miss a word. Hello. I got a plan... Okay, brother. Yes. Lakshmanan. We realize the value of something when we lose it. This damn warmth and scent of love... will vanish within a couple of days once you come to reality. Now she doesn't need money or family. Only love is important! Hey! Go! Go away! What he is saying is right. Daddy is doing everything for your good future and happiness. I didn't expect Daddy will go to this extent for my happiness. Whatever happens, I'm going to face those theft charges. It's better than going back to that house. No, dear. What he is saying... - The girl is there? - Yes. Brother, I punctured the wheel. They can't go too far now. Okay, superb! The girl we are looking for is in a car. The plan is on! - The car won't go too far. - Okay. - Understood? - Understood. The girl is found. We go there quickly and attack! Yes, bro. Don't forget the plan when we reach there. - Don't worry! - We'll do it. - All is okay! - Good. Be cool. Relax! Don't stress! Careful. Careful. Lakshmanan, I think the tire is punctured. You go and check. What timing! It's punctured, sir. Really? - Damn it! - Don't worry, sir. I'll fix it. I have so much experience in changing the tires of police jeeps. So I can do it quickly. This jack is not that good, still... we'll change it. Hey, what are you thinking? Is running away from home the freedom you seek? Or do you think cheating your father and getting your marriage registered somewhere is a great achievement? I left home intending to come back. I would have come back when you come to your senses. Enough! No matter what you say to try and manipulate me, I love Sethu. It's only going to intensify. Do whatever you want. Sir. - Hello? - Hello? A blue Benz car, Kerala registration. - What? - Blue Benz car. Oh! A blue Benz car? You come to Talapady tollbooth. We'll also join you there. Yeah, I'll come. Dear... I didn't come just because of my loyalty to him. When you are in trouble... Don't bother to explain much, uncle. If I have any good childhood memories it is with you. And you put that gold in my bag! I won't kill myself if I couldn't marry Sethu. But, in this life, don't you ever think that I'll even smile at you! Dear... Oh my, God! They have changed the tire. The car will leave now. Come! Oh, no! I can't see a thing! Come! Dear... here. This is your bag, keep it. Isn't there pepper spray in your bag? Take that out. Take it out! This... - Spray that into my eyes and escape. - What?! Spray that into my eyes and escape! - Oh, don't... - Give it to me. Don't! Oh, no! My eyes! What are you waiting for? Get off and run before he sees you. - Listen to me. Go... - No. - Dad will run after me and catch me. - Just run! - Running is risky. - My eyes! - I'll take the car. - Make it fast. Oh, no! Don't start the car! Don't take the car. Uncle, hold tight. Stop! Hey! - Hey! Stop! - Hey. Oh, my God! Oh, no! You hit him! Murdered! He is dead! Why... - Come, sir. - Who are you? - Come, sir. - Let me go. - Where are you taking me? - Sir! I am from Kerala Police. Police... Come with us, sir. Come. Let me go. I'm from Kerala Police. Who are you? Sethu! Why are you driving? That's... Don't worry there are people with us. Hey, who are you? Let me go! Boss, we have stopped her daddy. Run! You losers, that's not her daddy. - He is not her daddy? - Her daddy is no more, you idiots! Oh, no! Daddy! Don't hit him! That man in the black T-shirt. He's her dad. Hey, New Daddy, stop! - Let him go. - Stay away. Hold him! Catch him. - Hold his legs. - Hold him. Sir... - Sir! - Let me go. Run, brother. Run! Stop it, Daddy. Let me go. Hold him. Hey, watch out! Truck! Get in. Come... Chinnappaa! - Climb up. - Hold my hand. Oh, no! Sethu, are you okay? You are not injured, right? You jumped in front of the running car! What else could I have done? What about your jump yesterday? When I saw you jump, I made up my mind that I would only go home with you. Sir... Is he deaf?! Sir! Help me, sir! Hello, did you find those two? Yeah! They are with me in my vehicle. I knew it! Her damn daddy! Who are those tiger-faced lads? I'll tell you everything. We have time till we reach Coimbatore. Will they hurt my daddy? I hope your daddy won't hurt them! - It was one hell of a slap. - Oh, sorry. What about Sumi? She understood everything. She must be on the bus heading home with her uncles. Poor things. We made them run a lot. They made us run as well.
