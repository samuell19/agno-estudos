[PHONE RINGS] Hello. Hey, Bill. What's up? Oh, God. Why do these things always come up on the weekends? Look, I'll run it through on my computer here, and I'll call you back tomorrow, all right? Oh, where do you think you're going, Justin? All right. Bye-bye [BABY COOING] Trying to make an escape, huh, big guy? Ooh, watch it. Come on. Oh. Come on. Come back. Whoo! Ooh, look, your favorite toys. Come on, sit down. Ah, Mommy's gotta work. There you go. Okay. I'll get this. Come on, sit down here. Oh! Ah. Oh! Ooh. [LAUGHS] Don't ever stop that. Ever. You're so tensed, you need a break. Oh, soon, soon. [KISSES] How you doing? Well, Felder vs. United States is getting all mixed up with Arizona vs. Kincaid. Ooh. Hmm. I thought freelancing was gonna be a cinch, huh? Yeah, right. [PHONE RINGS] Hello! No, I'm sorry, she can't come to the phone right now, can I take a message? [BABY CRIES] Justin! DR. SIRA: I don't see any problem here. The x-rays are fine, I'm certain there's no concussion. Just a nasty bruise. Oh, thank God. I feel so guilty. No, no, it was my fault. Well, no harm done. A little liquid aspirin will get him through the night. Be sure and have your pediatrician take a look at him in a day or two. Thanks, Doc. Thank you. Come here, sweetie. Thank you. [ANNOUNCEMENT] Dr. Robert Gray... Come on, let's go. You okay, big guy? ...Dr. Robert Gray, line 2. [BABY COOS] Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's time to go to sleep, big guy. [FLOORBOARD CREAKS] Are you not coming to bed, honey? It's about ten o'clock. Oh, I know. I still have ways to go on this brief. I promised them I'll have it done by Friday. Hey, no one wants to watch you burn out. Hey, you know what, I'm gonna go get you a cappuccino. You're gonna need the caffeine. Ooh, thank you. Oh, do me a favor. Would you turn on Justin's monitor before you go? I forgot to do it. Sure. Thank you. I love you. [CHUCKLES] Okay.

Come on, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. Honey, all the doors and windows are locked. Nobody's been in here. It's just really strange, you know? Uh, maybe, maybe you were listening in on someone else's monitor. Is that possible? Well, yeah, I think so. I mean, these things only operate You know how many parents out there have this kind of monitor? Yeah, I guess so. It just really spooked me. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [BABY CRIES] [ENGINE REVS] [INDISTINCT YELLING] MAN: Gotta do the air runs first. Hey, Brian! You got a minute? Sure, what's the problem? Last night, the pilot reported a mod C failure at about 20,000 feet. Hey, what happened to you last night sounds kinda weird. Yeah, now, Donna want a home security system. Yeah? We have one of those. Keep it stashed under the mattress. Hey, listen, I think we better do a static system test. We may have a little moisture in here. Could be. I've checked all the lines, and nothings crossed. What's that you said about your security system? Oh, I have a .357 magnum. Donna wouldn't want a gun in the house with Justin crawling around. Well, an alarm will take care of most burglars, but it's the crazies I'm worried about. Only one thing will stop them. [BABY COOING] Well, aside from the bruise, you have a perfectly healthy 1-year-old. 23 pounds, 30 inches, right in the normal range. I think you have an athlete on your hands there. He's terrific. We're the ones who need work. Look, Donna, let me tell you something. Many of the big changes in your life will happen over time, slowly, but when you have a baby, ooh, it's like that. Overnight your life changes. Forever. Takes a little time to get used to it. SALESMAN: The Centaur 3000 monitors up to 12 different areas. It actually tells you when any door or window is open, even when the system isn't armed. Zone one. Security alert. Door open. In the event of a break-in, a distress signal is instantly sent to hour 24-hour monitoring station. If you press the emergency button, the police are summoned as well. I like it. I think we should get it. How long does it take for the police to get here after the alarm's triggered. No more than ten minutes. What is some psycho breaks in? I mean, he could kill us all and be gone in two. With all due respect, McDermott, no alarm system will stop a psycho. But ours will certainly deter one. How soon can you install it? [CHATTERING] Hello, Joan. Looking tense. You said 7:30, it's almost 8:00. I'm sorry, I had an important client. You're sorry? That's all you can say? I said hot tea! Relax, you're doing great. There hasn't been a word on the news or in the papers. I'm fine. $5,000. 25% as agreed. Thank you. You earned it. I found another one. In Northside. Yaay! Oh, Mommy's gotta get dressed. Have you seen my black belt? Yeah, it's in the closet. I just looked. I'll just wear the brown one. Hey, buddy. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. We're really running late, honey. No, we're not. Besides, the Avila's will understand. You okay, tiger? Oh. Aw. You okay? It's time to play big, big guy. We need to baby-proof this room a lot better. Come here. Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Ryan, your black belt is right-- Now, where were we? I know. I know. I was gonna tell you about it on the drive over. How could you buy something like this without discussing it with me first? I know, you're right. But I-I didn't buy it, Bill lent it to me. We've got a baby in the house. Even the security guy said no system will stop a psycho. I-I've even hidden the bullets in a completely different drawer. I still want it out of here, okay? [DOORBELL RINGS] It'll be gone tomorrow. Thanks, honey. Zone one. Door open. Hi, I'm Rachel. The babysitter. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Come on in. Honey, the babysitters here. [BABY YELLING] Oh. Hi. Hi. Oh, hi, Rachel. Susan couldn't make it tonight. But she gave Rachel very high marks. Listen, Justin's already been fed. The phone number we're going to be at is by the phone on a Post-It. just in case it accidentally goes off. [BABY YELLING] Okay, great. Well, come meet Justin. He looks like he wants to meet you. Yeah. Hi, sweetheart. [BABY YELLING] Baby. [LAUGHS] You are just about the cutest little boy I've seen in my whole life. Yes. Excuse me. He looks just like his dad. Hey, thanks for letting Mom and Dad have the night off, tiger. Go easy on Rachel, we don't wanna scare her off. Oh, no chance of that. We shouldn't be too late. Okay. BRIAN: This dinner looks incredible, Kay. KAY: Thank you. [CHUCKLES] I'd like to when you had time to cook all this I gotta tell you, I don't know how she does it. Hey, I've been saying the same thing. On top of that, Donna has been on the computer every single night working on a freelance assignment until midnight. Actually, the firm has offered me a permanent position. Hey. It's only three clients, it's no big deal, but they'll let me work out of the house. That's wonderful. That's fantastic, honey. Thanks. Well, I guess you're gonna be hiring a nanny now, huh? Well, we already have someone who comes into help with the housework, I'll ask her her to give us some more time, but, uh, we wanna be the ones to raise Justin. Yes, but there are only so many hours in the day. Brian and I can handle it. Yeah. Sure. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Zone one. Security alert. Oh, God, you scared me. Guess I should have shouted out that we were home. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. I, uh, I shouldn't have had it up so loud. Oh, yeah, right after you left. He's an angel. Okay, here you go. Ah, thank you. Let me give you a ride home. Okay, great. Be a few minutes. Good night. Bye bye. Psych major, huh? Oh, no, I, I just like psychology. Yeah? It's fascinating. People don't always do things that make sense. What do you mean? Well, we all have impulses. Greed, power, love, sex. It's just a question of whether or not you act on them. So, did Justin give you any problems? No, Mr. McDermott. Justin was no problem at all. Good. [ON TV] Kate, I had to do something... Finally got him to go back to sleep. Come here. Mm. Mm. I don't know if it's the wine or what, but I'm dead tired. What? Nothing. Come on, just say it. You resent my working so much, right? No, I don't. Just be honest, you'd be much happier if I quit my job. I never said I didn't want you to have a career, honey. Look at you, I mean, you're exhausted all the time, and it's only gonna get worse. Just because I don't wanna have sex tonight doesn't mean anything. This isn't just about sex. Every time we try t talk to each other, we end up arguing. I miss the closeness. I miss you. [BABY CRYING] I'll go. Look. Everything's gonna work out. I promise. [BABY CRYING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [BABY CRYING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Damn it! If that kid doesn't shut up, I'm gonna smack him.

[GUN FIRES] [BABY CRYING] MAN: We interrupt this program to bring you a special report. Earlier this evening, tragedy struck the normally peaceful suburb of Northside when a ten-month-old baby boy was kidnapped, and his father was shot to death. Police have note released further details regarding... Honey! Hon! Baby was just kidnapped in Northside. WOMAN: And this point, Paul, we don't have much to go on. But apparently an intruder wearing a ski-mask broke in through the nursery window and was confronted by the child's father. As yet, no motive has been established. Police are doing everything they can to solve this crime as quickly as possible. My God. OFFICER: Folks, we need you to stand back. FEMALE OFFICER: Attention, all units... So what you got? Found a 9mm casing. Looks like the husband was shot with his own gun. Any prints on it? Hmm, just the victim's and some smudges. My guess is the shooter wore glove. Yeah, maybe he didn't put them on until he got inside. Make sure you get outside the windowsill and all. WOMAN: I think you might wanna take a look at this. Helen, there was a problem this time. A problem? I saw it on the news! Is the baby all right? Yeah, the baby's fine. It was an accident. What were you doing with a gun? I told you never to use a gun. It was his gun! He tried to shoot me Where is it? I left it there. Helen, I don't like it when somebody shoots at me. Were you wearing gloves? Of course. I always do. Nobody saw me, okay? It's fine. It is definitely not fine, Robert. [BABY CRYING] He is going to his new parents in the morning. Take him inside. The unfortunate fact is that healthy babies available for adoption are few and far between. And lately, there have been dozens of legal problems with surrogate motherhood, which further limits your options. We've been to all the clinics. We've tried everything. Adopting is our only alternative. And I'm not getting any younger. Neither of us is. On top of which, I'm taking over the European operations from my company so I wanna accomplish this by the end of the month. Even if we were lucky enough to find someone who is willing to give up their child-- I wanna make it clear that money is not a problem here. I handled a special case recently that took nearly a $100,000. As I said, not a problem. I can't promise anything, but I'll keep in touch. Thank you. Thank you. I could take an x-ray but I don't think it's necessary. I was literally a foot away from him when this happened. It happened that quick. It's amazing his head hasn't cracked open by now. Well, they are unstoppable at this age. Your boy will be fine. But mom seems a little more fatigued than usual. Everything okay at home? Lan Corporation thought we did a great job with that mod C problem. Looks like they'll be sending us their whole fleet. Hey, I know it's none of my business, but lately I've been sensing a little chill. Feel like talking about it? There just aren't enough hours in the day. Do you think I'm being selfish for wanting to work? And the fact is, I do wanna be the one that's there for Justin. And I think it's important that he understands that both daddies and mommies have jobs and careers. I don't want her to be anybody but herself. Problem is, this isn't the only problem we're having. It's like she's not attracted to me anymore. Fall asleep the second my head hits the pillow. I know Brian's been upset about that. BRIAN: We don't have time for each other anymore. When we are alone, all we're talking about are diapers and formula. Relax, you just had a kid. It comes with the territory. I know, I know, I should stop feeling sorry for myself. Something is just missing now. [CHATTERING] What the hell happened last night? Keep your voice down. Everything is fine, the baby's been delivered. I just left some new clients who want a baby right way. Are you crazy? Robert is out of control. Who knows what's gonna happen next time? Last night was a fluke. It'll never happen again. Frankly, I'm more worried about you than him. Well, there is nothing to be concerned about, because I'm out. Joan. Do I need to remind you that I suppressed very incriminating evidence in your case? You owe me. That case is history. You were never tried, Joan. What do you think the police would do if that evidence suddenly dropped on their desks. They'd reopen your case in a heartbeat. Find me a baby as soon as possible. [BABY COOING] [DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS] BRIAN: Hey, everybody. Daddy's home. Hey, sweetie. Mm. Where's my little man? Aw, jeez, come here. Get out of there. Get out of there. Daddy's glad to see you too. Let me guess, you had Delibrencio to come over for lunch, right? I forgot to bring your shirts to the laundry, so I'm doing them myself, But first I had to fax contracts to the office. Honey, honey, it's okay. I was just trying to make a joke. I know. I look terrible. No, you don't. Say "Mommy looks beautiful." I thought you weren't going to push yourself like this. I know. [TIMER RINGS] Honey, could you hand me that other potholder, please? Ow. Hold on, I got it, I got it. Thank you. Ooh. Ow. You know what, you're right. I can't have it both ways. I am not the super-mom type after all. No, come one, sure you are. No, Brian, I am gonna quit the firm. I can't take on a pressure position like this right now. I need to be able to control the number of hours that I work. Are you sure? Listen, they're having a seminar in Portland, about starting a private practice. I can work out of the house. When is it? This weekend. It's just one night out of town, though. Well, if you think it's something that... Justin! [BABY CRIES] You're very lucky. I don't anticipate any scarring. You said he grabbed the cord and it fell on him? Is that correct? Yeah, that's right. I-- I just put him down for a minute. And it... Okay. I have some ointment here for you, along with a prescription. You're gonna be okay. Mwah. You're gonna be all right. All right. You go down now. Okay, just sit here for a sec, and daddy will be right back, sweetheart. Well, hi there, Justin. I'm so sorry to see you back at the hospital again. Yeah, I bet you don't like having to come to this nasty old place, do you? No. Here, let me help you do that. Thanks. You are very sweet boy. Oh, yes, you are. Everything's gonna be just fine, now. Yes, it is. Take a lollipop on the way out. KID: Thank you. Doctor, there's a call for you. Who is it? Someone from the medical center asking about Justin McDermott. I'll take it. Okay. This is the records department at Seaport Medical Center. And we've become concerned about a patient of yours, Justin McDermott. Do you recall him? Certainly. Is he all right? Well, he was treated in the ER last night for a burn on his arm. How bad? but it seems he's been in the emergency room before and we're just doing a follow up. As his pediatrician, we thought you might know a little more about his family situation. When was the last time you examined him? I just saw him a few days ago. Did he have any bruises or any other visible injuries then? He had a bruise on his knee, but his mother assured me everything was fine. Head injuries, bruises, burns, I mean, doctor, is it possible he is being abused? There's some strain in the marriage, but no. Look, I feel it would be improper to notify the authorities at this time. Oh, we're not at that point yet. We just want to be alert in case the pattern repeats. So is it possible? I suppose anything's possible. Thank you. Thank you very much, Doctor. DONNA: Just wish I felt better about this. Honey, I have both days off, the housekeeper's coming in, I double-checked all the baby-proofing. I know. I know. Brian, are we doing something wrong? Honey. Talk to some of our friends. They all have worse stories about their kids getting hurt. All we can do is our best, right, little guy? Don't worry about going. You need to do this. And Justin's gonna be fine. Really. Take good care of him, okay? I'll call you when I get there. Have a good trip. Say, "Bye, Mommy." Drive carefully. Bye. Bye, sweetie. Bye. Say, "Bye, Mommy." Bye. Bye. Ah. You sleep well, big guy. Daddy's got a fun day planned for us tomorrow. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Yeah, Bill? Now? No, no, I can't. Donna's out of town, and Justin's asleep. Did you run a diagnostic? Yeah, I know, I know it was fine in the morning. Oh, damn it! All right, listen, I'll see if I can get a sitter and I'll call you back. Okay, all right. [DOORBELL RINGS] Hi. All right. Hey, come on in. Listen thanks for coming on such short notice. Oh, no problem. Justin's asleep in his room. I have the monitor out in the den. I really shouldn't be that long. Bad timing, huh? Your wife has to go out of town, you have to go into work. My number at work is by the phone, just in case you need to reach me. Don't worry about Justin. He's in very good hands. Thanks again. Zone one. Door open. [KEYPAD BEEPS] So, tell me about this babysitter. Your fantasy life a little slow? No, just my real life. The in-laws are in this weekend. I'm sorry to hear that. So, back to the babysitter. I can see it now. You come in, she's got a nice fire burning couple of glasses of Cabernet poured. She's wearing one of those numbers from Victoria's Secret. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [THUNDERCLAPS] [RAIN PATTERING] [THUNDERCLAP] That should take care of it. [THUNDER RUMBLING] I can't wait to drive home in that. Yeah, you and me both. [THUNDERCLAPS] [KEYPAD BEEPS] [DOOR OPENS] Hey, you're home early. So how did it go? Brian? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Oh, my God. You're soaked! I forgot my umbrella. Listen, I gotta change clothes, how's Justin? Not a peep. Good. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [THUNDERCLAP] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] I'll have to write you a check. Oh, it's no problem. You know, I was thinking it's, it's gonna take forever to get a cab in this weather. Maybe we just wait for the rain to let up. You think that's a good idea? Rachel... [MUSIC SLOWLY INTENSIFIES] Zone three. Security alert. [BABY CRIES] Shh. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. That's it. Rachel, this is a mistake. I can't do this. I'll call you a cab. [BABY CRIES] [BABY CRIES] [BABY CRIES] I'll be right back. We have to talk about this. ♪ Rock-a-by baby On the tree top ♪ When the wind blows The cradle-- ♪ [GUNSHOTS] Brian! [ALARM BLARING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Mrs. McDermott? Yes? Portland police. Can we talk to you for a minute? Police? Can I see some identification, please? Certainly. I'm Detective Tauber, this is my partner, Detective Pruso. What is it? Is it my husband? I'm afraid we don't have the whole picture yet, ma'am. But apparently there's been an incident at your house. It seems an intruder broke in through the nursery window. Now, the intruder got away, but I'm sorry to have to tell you he took your son with him. Justin was kidnapped? That's the assumption everyone is working on at the moment, ma'am. Now, we're going to take you to the airport as soon as you're ready to travel. Are you all right? I gotta call Brian. Oh, my baby! Make it a quick call, ma'am! They wanna keep the phone lines clear. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] First thing in the morning, all right? You have my card. Okay, thanks. Lieutenant? There are no prints, some smudges. 10:1 he was wearing gloves. How about that, Mr. McDermott, was he wearing gloves? Maybe. I, I really can't remember. Is there anything else you can recall? Mr. McDermott. If we don't find the victim within the first eight hours, our odds go way down. Now, I know this is tough, but you gotta set aside your feelings for a little while, and think hard, for your son's sake. All I know was what I told you. He was a tall guy. OFFICER: Mrs. McDermott? Brian... That's where he came in. Mrs. McDermott I'm Lt. Dugger, I'm heading up the investigation. I know how upsetting this must be to you, but I have a few questions I need to ask. Does Justin have any distinguishing marks or scars? A birthmark maybe? No. Yes. He has a burn on his right arm. Oh, that's right. I was thinking about birthmarks. Right arm? Above or below the elbow? Right here. I've already asked your husband this, but, is there anyone you can think of who might wanna harm you? Someone holding a grudge of any kind? No. No one. I mean, come on we're not rich. Why would someone wanna take our baby? I'm not sure, ma'am. We put a tap on your phone. And I'm leaving officers here to monitor your calls. If you have to go out, we'll forward any calls to you on your cell phone. We've got it all worked out. What about the FBI? Um, they've been contacted. They're working on it from their end. Try not to worry, Mrs. McDermott, we're working hard to get your son back. I'll call you as soon as I have something. Thank you. [SIGHS] OFFICER ON RADIO: At code 30... Lieutenant. It's a dead ringer for the Northside abduction, isn't it? Sure is. Or maybe that's what somebody wants us to think. [CAR DOOR OPENS] How could you have done something so stupid? You're not the one on the firing line, okay? For all I know, he could have had a gun, too. This isn't an armed robbery at a mini mart, Robert. If you get caught, no one is going to be able to get you off. Not even me. I'm not gonna get caught. If you wanna work for me, if you wanna live here, then you'll give me that gun. Right now. What's this? I think it's a burn. A burn? Yeah, is that a problem? A burn is identifiable, Robert. We're going to have to keep him here until we can get rid of this bandage. FEMALE OFFICER ON RADIO: 7A 43, state again. OFFICER 1: Ana Lauren? OFFICER 2: Yeah, we got here here. That should do it. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so selfish, I had to go for that stupid seminar. I should have been home taking care of my baby. It wasn't your fault. It wasn't your fault. He took my son. It's mine. There's something I need to talk to you about. [DOORBELL RINGS] We just heard. Come on in. [DOOR SHUTS] We thought you probably wouldn't feel like cooking late. So, Kay made a casserole. God, Brian, we're so sorry. Thanks. Have you heard anything yet? No. Well, if there's anything we can do. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Yes, Lieutenant? We'll be right down. I know you didn't see the man, but you may been watched over a period of time for the last few days. Um, do one of these faces ring a bell? if you could help me with a couple other things, Mr. McDermott? In my office? Yeah. Sure. You'll be okay. All right? What do you need? Just a little privacy. Have a seat. Can I call you Brian? Sure. So, Brian. Anything you've forgotten to tell me about? Like what? Well, I, uh, I talked to Rachel Edmond this morning. You sorta forgot to mention you two being in the bedroom las night. No, no, I don't care what you were doing with the babysitter. What I'm interested in is the baby. Well, I'm concerned about what else you might have neglected to mention. Like the fact that your son had a bad burn on his arm. You asked about birthmarks. No, I asked about identifying marks. How did he get burned anyway? It was an accident. He pulled on the cord, and the iron fell. Does your son have a lot of accidents? What're you getting at? I'm just trying to get the whole picture here, Brian. [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] Have you heard anything? Mm-hmm. Could you give us a couple of minutes alone, please? Yeah. I can't stop thinking about him. You know? I mean, is he cold? Is he hungry? Donna there's something I think you should know about what happened last night. What? What is it? The moment he broke in, I was in the bedroom. I got caught in the rain, and I had to change my clothes. You already told me that. I wasn't alone. Rachel was with me. She came in to tell me it might take a while to get a cab. So-- What do you mean with you? It was just a kiss. Nothing happened, really. You mean to stand here and tell me that while your son was being stolen I have never felt guiltier about anything in my life, Donna. You have to believe that. I go away for one night and this is what happens? I can't even look at you, right now. I think you should leave. [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHES] Who the hell are you? What's going on? Take it easy, Mr. McDermott. Detective Braeden, Metro Division. I'm assigned the investigation of your son's disappearance. I'm under surveillance? Standard procedure for this type of situation, Mr. McDermott. Donna. Donna, something's just happened Listen, whatever you think of me, right now, I need to come home. We gotta talk. It's just so unbelievable that they would be following you. Yeah, it is. I mean, we're the victims, here. What're they thinking? I have no idea. Donna, I know I let you down. But we have to be together on this. It's the only way we're gonna get through it. [PHONE RINGS] OFFICER: We got a call coming in. Let's go. Hello? Yes, hold on. It's Rachel. She wants to talk to you. Hello? [CHATTERING] Hi. Hi. Look, I gotta get back, what'd you wanna talk about? It was just one of those moments, Brian. I mean, you were there, and I was there, and... I'm sorry. Hey, it was just as much my fault. I never should have let it happen. But what's done is done. Is that all? What I really want to see you about is the police. What about them? Well, when I talked to that Lt. Dugger, He asked me if I'd actually seen Justin that night. And? Well, that's the thing, Justin was already asleep when I got there. So I just turned on the TV, and... And I had the monitor right next to me the whole time. You didn't check on him? Well, he was asleep, I didn't want him to wake up. And I was about to go and check on him when you came in, and... Well, you know what happened then. You know he was in there, Rachel. That's true. But I never actually saw him that night. I had to tell him the truth. I'm really sorry. So how did it go? You never told me about the burn on his arm. Well, you were the one in a rush, not me. Now, where's my money? I can't deliver the baby until the bandages come off. That is your problem. I wanna get paid, and I want out. I thought I made it clear-- You wanna turn in my confession, be my guest. Because I'm at a point where I really don't give a damn anymore. Calm down, Joan. In a few days, I'll have your payment. I want my money now, and this time, I want half. $10,000 That's ridiculous! Well, this isn't a negotiation. In fact, go ahead and show them my confession. 'Cause the way I see it, I could cut myself a pretty decent deal if I tell the police everything I know about the kidnappings, don't you think? Fine, Joan. $10,000 it is. DONNA: She's sorry? Fine. We all are. Nothing happened. Brian, you know, it's not whether or not you actually slept with her, think you were the type of person to get into a situation like that. I made a mistake. I'm still the same person. I don't know, I really don't. Anyway... An apology wasn't the only reason Rachel wanted to meet. She wanted to warn me. Dugger asked her is she's actually seen Justin that night. And she said no. He was already asleep when she got here. And Dugger thinks Justin was never in that room that night. That's insane-- That is why these cops are here. That's why he's having me followed. And what? What, they think we arranged a fake kidnapping? Yeah. And tried to make it look like that other one in Northside. But this is crazy! Just watch the evening news, honey. You remember that woman who drowned her two kids in her car And then there was the guy who backed over his daughter intentionally, and claimed it was an accident. They think Justin's dead? He's not dead. What is he is dead? I will not accept that! We're gonna get him back. I'll make up the bed and stay for you, okay? [ROCK-A-BY BABY MUSIC PLAYS] [ROCK-A-BY BABY MUSIC PLAYS] Brian, wake up. Wake up. The lullaby. What? The newspaper said that in the Northside case the woman heard the kidnapper singing the baby a lullaby. Remember that night that you went out for coffee and I thought I heard you on the monitor? The voice that I heard was singiRock-a-bye Baby. That's the same song the guy was singing when he took Justin. It's gotta be the same man. These monitors only have a short range. If someone else has as unit like ours, they'd have to be close by. Have there been any other kids in the neighborhood reported missing? No, not that I know of. We can damn sure knock on a few doors and find out who else has a monitor like ours. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYS] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] HELEN: We were very lucky to find him, Mrs. Simmonds. MRS. SIMMONDS: Can you tell us anything else about his birth parents? HELEN: I'm afraid as part of our agreement, they asked that their identities be secret. Of course. The main thing is that we're getting a healthy child. Here's the first half. The final sum of $50,000 is payable on the day itself. Which should be very soon now. We were under the impression that we were gonna pick him up today. Well, I'm afraid there's been an unavoidable delay. We're looking at another week, perhaps two. You promised us a child by the end of this week. How do we know the birth parents won't decide to change their minds? That won't happen, in this case, I can assure you. If we can't have that child by Friday, we're gonna have to cancel our agreement. Minus the reasonable expenses you've incurred, of course. I may have to pull some strings. But you'll have your baby. WOMAN: I don't know if I can help you, folks, but ask away. Have you heard of any children being taken from here? Missing maybe? Yeah. Happened a couple of weeks ago. The people in 127, right over there. What happened? Custody thing Ex-husband broke in one night and took the little girl. Did they notify the police? Well, yeah. I assume they did. Why wouldn't they? Thanks. Thank you. Yes? Hi. My name is Donna McDermott. And this is my husband, Brian. Hi. We live down the street. We'd like to talk to you about your daughter. You're not cops? No. Can we come in? Please? Yeah. Somebody took out baby, too. Maybe we can help each other. I'm sure it was my ex-husband who took Elizabeth. Did it once before. Did you actually see him take her? No. We were at a party two doors down. We brought the monitor. Guess it was too noisy to hear it. Why didn't you report it? I've been living with Kurt for about a year now, and... he doesn't have much patience with kids. He's been very tough on Elizabeth, you know what I mean? I figured she'd be better off with her dad. Are you positive it was your ex-husband who took her? He had been threatening to o it again. This time he was clever. Cut a hole in the glass, came in through the window. Did you try to contact your ex-husband after this happened? He moved. Kurt made me promise not to report him. Why? He's got a short fuse, and... couple of other complaints on his records. If her ex-husband has her daughter, we've got nothing. Yeah, but if he doesn't, this is a kidnapping just like ours. Probably by the same guy. And it wasn't reported. I know. We've got to get to Dugger. [CHATTERING] Yeah. Yeah, okay, thanks. Well, Lucy Becknell's ex-husband didn't even know the kid's missing. Yeah, we checked it out. He doesn't have the baby. It looks like the guy who took her daughter may have taken your son, too. Why is this happening? Why haven't there been any ransom calls? Well, I think this is something being done for the black market. What you have to understand is there's a market for babies. I mean, to legally adopt a child could take years, with no guarantees even then, so there are brokers. You think someone's trying to sell our son? It's big money. Six-figure fees are not uncommon. Some wealthy people don't care, they just wanna cut through the red tape and get it done. Ans when people are willing to pay there's always someone willing to do what's needed. Why these babies? What's the connection? Well, there's, there's something I've noticed here. Lucy Becknell's daughter was being abused by her boyfriend, she says. According to this, the Northside kid was also being abused. Justin wasn't being abused. No, but the kidnappers probably thought he was. Head injuries, burns, emergency room visits. The thing is, people who abuse their children generally don't wanna draw attention to themselves. So they might not be so quick to report the child missing. Like I told you, the longer a child is missing, the harder it is to get them back. I think that's what the kidnappers are counting on. [PHONE RINGS] We've already got computer data coming in from the FBI. Anything having to do with illegal adoption, anything, anybody convicted of baby stealing, brokers, attorneys, agencies, you name it. Listen, I'm sorry we had to put you both through the wringer. We were only thinking of your boy. Keep us informed. Every step of the way. Thanks, Lieutenant. You know, I did get a call from a woman at the medical center. Who? Someone from records. I don't recall her name. She said she was concerned with how many visits that Justin had made to the ER and did I suspect abuse. I know you both love Justin very much, and you would never hurt him intentionally. Could this woman have been a doctor? Doubtful. Still, she did ask leading question. "Could it have been?," "Is it possible?," that kinda thing. And you said? I said anything is possible. I-I-I I didn't, I didn't mean-- I was... I'm very-- I'm very sorry. Let's go. WOMAN: Dr. Terrence Edwards to ICU. Dr. Terrence Edwards to ICU. Excuse me? May I help you? Yes, our son, Justin McDermott was a patient here. We'd like to take a look at his records. Of course. I'll just need to see some ID. Sure. Aren't you little Justin's parents? Oh, he's such a sweetheart. How's he doing? Justin was kidnapped. Oh, my God, that's horrible. How long ago was your son admitted? Less than a week ago. I can't seem to find his records. Well, I wouldn't worry about it. His file is probably up in pediatrics. With all the people going in and out of this room it's a wonder anything's where it's supposed to be. I tell you what? Why don't I track it down myself and I'll call you as soon as I find it? We'd appreciate that. Certainly. PA SYSTEM: Nurse Emerson to Physical Therapy. Excuse me? Have the police turned up anything yet? I mean, you must be worried sick. They think our son was kidnapped for black market adoption. They say people pay over $100,000 for a baby like Justin. It's unbelievable what people are capable of. Robert! Robert! Hello, Robert. Has Helen called yet? No. What's going on? She's probably still in her meeting. Helen wants me to, uh, take the baby to the hospital, right away. Seems he has an insulin deficiency. And if we don't treat him soon he could go into diabetic shock. Where is he? Taking a nap. That's not a good sign. Get him ready to go. Helen wants me to get the baby's records from her files. Oh, and we need the car seat and the carrier, too. [DOOR CLOSES] Robert? Robert? Robert, bring the baby down. I need to check his burn. We have to deliver him by Friday. Joan just picked him up. What? She took him to the hospital. She said you knew all about it. Couple oh hours ago? What's happening? I'm not sure. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYS] [TELEPHONE RINGS] You must really think I'm an idiot. Joan, where's the baby? You've been cheating me blind. Helen, I've seen the file! You're getting a $100,000 for this baby. There's obviously been a misunderstanding. Listen to me, Joan. No, you listen to me. Meet me at the garage in an hour. And bring the money. Whatever you say. Just take care of the baby. If you wanna see this baby again, it's gonna cost you $50,000. I only want what's fair. So do I, Joan. [STRING MUSIC PLAYS] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] You know, we became a family without ever really thinking it through. I guess we never realized how much hard work there's in being a parent. He changed our lives so much. I just can't imagine our life without him, you know? We have to have another chance. If we're gonna get through this, we're gonna have to do it together. Where's the baby? Where's my money? You'll get it when he's delivered. I want it now. $50,000. That's half. Joan, be reasonable. I'm the one who takes all the risks, pays all the expenses. What do you do? You point your finger, and you say, "That one." And if didn't, you'd have nothing! God only knows how much you cheated me before this. I should be taking the whole $100,000. You should be in jail, right now. You committed murder, and I'm the one that got you off, scot-free. I only want what's mine. This baby is not yours. Joan! Give me that! [CHATTERING] BRIAN: Lieutenant. Any of those leads panned out? How much sleep have you two gotten? We'll sleep when Justin gets home. Uh, nothing's jumping off the page, yet. We're running down the list of employees at the hospital. [PHONE RINGS] Dugger. Yeah, Braeden, what's up? Let me put you on the box I got the McDermotts here with me. Yeah, like I was saying, we found the body about an hour ago. The victim's presumed to be an attorney named Helen Sawyer. We found a car nearby, had legal documents, with some adoption paperwork in it. Sawyer... Yeah, here t is. Specializes in custody and adoption, office is on Market Street. It could be a coincidence, but I thought you might wanna know. Thanks. Going through the State Bar Association. It looks like Helen Sawyer was a criminal attorney for a while. Times Herald. Downloading a few articles on her. Time to go into the superior court records. See if I can find something... Wait a minute. Brian, look at this. Come here. What did you find? Look at this picture! That's the woman from the hospital! Oh, my... And it says here name is Joan Hollins. Says she was accused of stabbing her husband Claimed he was abusing her. Helen Sawyer was her attorney. Gotta get Dugger. Yes, Lt. Dugger, please. Well, where is he, this is urgent It's the McDermotts. We have some very important information. Can you right this down? Mr. Simmonds? Yes, this is Joan Hollins, I'm Helen Sawyer's associate. Well, actually, I'm calling at Helen's request. Unfortunately, she's been unavoidably detained. Oh, no, no, no, everything's fine. Um, I'll be the one delivering your baby. And she's authorized me to accept the final $50,000 installment as well. So why don't I meet you at your hotel and we'll take care of everything in short order. Say two o'clock? Excellent. Then I will see you then. Well, well, well, little one. It is almost pay day! Yeah! You live here? Yeah. What's going on? This is Helen Sawyer's house, isn't it? Yeah, she's not home right now. Are you a relative? No. Boyfriend? She's my lawyer. Who are you? Detective Harland Dugger. What's your name? Robert. Look I think you should come back, uh, when Helen's home. She's not coming home. Robert what? Hammack. Where is she? Helen's dead. Mind if we go inside, Robert? Look, unless you have a search warrant, you not going nowhere near-- I don't really need your permission. Why don't you come in with us? Go on, I'll catch up. OFFICER: Come with me, sir I thought maybe you might know something about that. I don't know anything. And what did Helen represent you on, Robert? Armed robbery, breaking and entering, grand theft? I have nothing to say. Huh. It's too bad she's not gonna be around to handle the kidnapping charges I'm about to lay on you. Hmm. We found the toy you tried to cover up in the truck, too. Where's the baby? You do understand if something happens to that kid, you're looking at the death penalty. Now, if you wanna cooperate with me, I might be able to do you some good. The sooner we find him, the less chance you'll be spending time on death row. What's it gonna be, Robert? Joan took him. Joan who? I don't know her last name, she's a client of Helen's. Now, I don't wanna talk anymore until I have a lawyer. Cuff him. Read him his rights. Stand up. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Dugger What, when did they call? Get an address, I'll be in the car. [BABY COOING] Will keep right in there. Okay. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [BABY COOING] Hello? Anyone home? [BABY CRIES] Come on! [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Maybe she didn't come all the way up.
