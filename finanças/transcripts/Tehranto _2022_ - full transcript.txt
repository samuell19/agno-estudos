You see, these days there are two types of Iranian immigrants: those who left Iran before the revolution, and those who left Iran after the revolution. In 1988, Rostam Alavi, a simple man from the town of Lalejin, and a conscripted soldier... and Shohreh, the daughter of a rice farmer and local smarty-pants, throw a party with their friends and family with enough dress-code violations to give a mullah an aneurysm. They get married and give birth to a baby boy that they lovingly name, Badi. On the other side of the world, in 1989, an Iranian couple by the names of... ... Fred and Tessa arrive at Toronto Pearson Airport. We are more Parisian than Persian. Growing up, Badi's pastimes included politics, working in his father's pottery shop... and helping to raise the family chickens with his cousin, Arash. In Toronto, Tessa and Fred give birth to a baby girl that they lovingly name Sharon. Back in Iran, Badi's heart skips a beat. Growing up, Sharon's pastimes were like most girls'. This included makeovers... ... art... Hey! Oh no! No, no, no, no! ... and cooking. Back in Iran, Badi and his parents board a plane for Toronto. Sharon's heart skips a beat. Oh, Sharon. Sharon. - Sharon! - I know, I know. Azizam, you're going to be late. -It's fine, Mother. -Why don't you just drive? Mama not this right now, please. I know, I just don't want you to be late. Yeah, but my ride's already on the way. -It's exam day. -Oh! And she's going to do great. Mamanee-- wait, no. I really have to go. Eh, who has two thumbs who's going to ace this real estate exam? Yeah, good, good. You're still going to meet with Adam, aren't you? Yes, Mom. The realtor I set her up with. Shoot, my ride's here. Wait, Mamanee-- Thank you. Oh, Adam is such a good realtor, Ma. Good luck! -Excuse me, are you Iranian? -Sorry? I was thinking maybe you are-- Iranian? Oh, no, I'm not. I'm Canadian. Hey, buddy, screw you! -What? -You don't speak Farsi? I-- I thought you did. You live in Richmond Hill. You look Iranian, and your name-- -Look, I really have to study. -I'm sorry. Hey! - Ugh! - Sorry! Get off the sidewalk, dickhead. What Sharon didn't realize at that moment was that crossing paths with this "dickhead" was her sernevesht, or destiny. No, no, no. Come on! What the-- I didn't even pass it to this guy, man. Dude, I'm wide open here. Wide open, baby. Damn it! Dude! The exam? So? We can hear you from inside. Whatever, Badi. You should write faster. -It was hard. -It's for pelvic surgery. Did you study? -Some med student. -Look, whatever. Just save your lectures. I gotta get going. Hey. -Did you bike here, bro? -Yeah, why? Dude, it's been snowing all afternoon. - What? - Yeah. But it's spring! Guys! Keep it down. Sorry. Freaking Canada! It's a really nice place. Very, uh-- very ethnic. How'd you-- how'd you hear about it? My grandmother works in the back. But yeah. Only there's talks of a condo going up here, so... Really? Here? Oh, you're a fan of gentrification. This looks so good. Mmm. Mmm, oh. Have you heard about the 36 question challenge? No, what's that? Allegedly, two people ask each other a specific set of 36 questions and they fall madly in love. Allegedly. All right, I'll bite. All right. One second, I'll bring it up. Let's do notes-- okay! Question one. You can invite anyone over for dinner, living or dead, who would you host? Oh, I don't know. Oh, my grandpa. You-- sorry, like, you could-- you could invite anyone, right? So, you could be interesting, pick someone like a JFK. Or like a Jesus. Like a Jesus Christ. Are you trying to sound smart or something? Oh, this isn't romantic. None of this is romantic. Oh, my God. Okay, I'm not trying to-- It's fine. Don't worry about it. -Listen-- -It's-- I'm not-- -I'm sure the game is fun. -It is. -It's a really fun game. -Really fun. I get laid all the time with this. It's just some of those questions are super personal, and we're not that close yet. Yeah, but, like... you want to be, right? Adam. Don't be sleazy. - Sleazy? - Shh. That's my grandma's laugh. You. Hi. -Maybe I wasn't-- -No, shh. Oh, you don't get to talk. You're the reason I have mud on my butt. Okay, I'm not looking. Is this a trap? -I feel like it's a trap. -Who is this guy? Hi. You have nothing better to do on Fridays than to come here and hit on my grandmother? It's surprising, right? I mean, you know, you'd get some attention, -but you seem pretty stuck up. -Oh, screw you. And besides, why aren't you helping out on Fridays? Not that I want to get out of helping you. Oh, how could you let Mamanee down? I have other responsibilities. -Oh, yeah? -Mm-hmm. -Yeah? -Yeah. Well, I think your other responsibilities needs your help. -Or a bib. -Ugh, whatever. Just keep it down, okay? Thanks. Goddamn it. Quick lesson, shall we? See those tasty drinks? That's Persian tea, also known as chai, but never "chai tea." It's a staple in any Persian gallery, sometimes accompanied by shisha or "ghalyan," a big sharable tobacco pipe. But personally, it's not my cup of chai. That sandwich is giving you stupid accuracy. Okay, first of all, it's not a "sandvich," it's a wrap. It's the same damn thing. No, it's not the same damn thing! Notice how the kabab is within the wrap? - I can't handle it. - Wrap. Wrap. Arash, verdict? Yo, what are you guys saying for Nowruz? Oh, yeah, just completely disregard what we were talking about. That's fine. Nothing. Probably dicking around playing I You know that game's about, like, a decade old? Okay, that was, like, my peak. So, let me have it, cool? Uh-uh. Why, you got something better for us? There's something going down at Persian Palace on Thursday. -Let's hit that up. -Dope. Let's do that then. -No. -Why? - 'Cause they're so fake. - Who? All these Per-mmigrant fake Roonis. -Bro, come on, we'll all go. -It'll be fun, man, screw it. All they do is they claim themselves off like Europeans, and then they throw themselves these fancy balls, all right? With no appreciation for culture. Yeah, but think of all the kabobs and sweets, huh? -Dude, what are you doing? -I don't know. Well, I'm going. I don't know about you. Som, you're obviously in, right? -Hell yeah, boy. -So, what, Badi? You going to stay home like a wasteman, eh? All right, fine, I'll go. Yeah! Ugh! Let's get it. Bom! Oh, shi-- You threw that at my kid! Sorry! Sharon. Sharon! Good evening, ladies! And gentlemen. Happy Nowruz! - Cream puff, sir? - Aw, yeah! -Bro, take it easy. -But I'm hungry. Dude, you had, like, ten cookies in the car. How are you still hungry? I actually really like that hideous dress there. - Oh, God. - What is it? The guy who just walked in with his friends... -Do you think they have-- -Don't look. -Oh. -Have seen "Oh"? - What's that? - Who? Why are we staring at the wall? Remember when I told you about that date with Adam? - What's the matter with you? - Remember Zahra Khanum? That nomhead that was -hitting on your grandma? -Yeah. You mean the one with the stuck-up granddaughter? - Yep. - Okay, wait. One at a time. We can't all look at the same time. Crap. Damn it. Um, I'm going to go to the bathroom. I am going to go find the cream puff guy. Okay, all right, let's get this party started. All right, guys? I want to introduce our DJ tonight. He's out here looking like every other Persian guy, except he has headphones on. Introducing DJ Ilyas! Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us tonight a very special guest from the city of Toronto. This woman is an absolute powerhouse. Please join me in welcoming City Councillor Mondana Moridi! Distinguished guests, fellow councillors, staff, family and friends. On behalf of the Moridi family, I'd like to thank you all for coming here tonight. And before we begin tonight's program, I'd like to give a special acknowledgment to my brother, Feridun, and his lovely wife, Atessa, for planning this beautiful evening. And as we do every year, we have another dance performance. Please join me in welcoming Roja Hanum as she performs a dance. -He's really yummy. -Oh, you would. That girl's still looking at me. Yeah. All right. I'm going for the kill. Wish me luck. What do you mean, "going for the kill"? Get back here! I'm just-- I'll be back! Badi, right? Shanus. - Mm-mm. - Shuka? -Sharon. -Sharon, right. Not a very Persian name. Mamanee, I will, okay? I promise. So, you're still hitting on my grandma. What, you're still too stuck up to get hit on? -Mamanee-- -Zahra-- Really? Well, I'm more into, like, you know, pre-revolutionary rock. Googoosh. Oh, God, help us. Oh, come on. You're not going to disappoint Mamanee, are you? You know what, it's fine. It's cool. Fine. Let's do it. Oh, you don't know how to dance! What are you talking about? I'm a pro. No, you're super stiff. Come on, loosen up. Keep the elbows up. -Who's that? -Who? That guy dancing with Sharon. - Hips. - No, that's weird. No, it's not, I promise. Relax. Maman set them up. He looks like a twisted marionette. This looks weird. You look stupid, but it's great, it's fine. It's fine! I'm joking, I'm joking. That's what it's supposed to look like, it's cool. There we go, there we go. It was while they danced that Badi's guard had lowered, and Sharon's doubt about Iranian men began to fade. For a moment, it felt as though it was only Badi and Sharon in the room, as he had forgotten about Arash, who was busy flirting with Kim. Or Som, who was still stuffing his face with cream puffs. What the hell? Hello? I have a fast metabolism! I had fun tonight. You're a natural. I'm glad you came. You know, this isn't usually my thing. No? Oh, you seemed so at home. Anyway, speaking of home, I should really get going. -I got to wake up early. -Oh, yeah? What's going on tomorrow? I gotta head to. I mean, they want to stock up in the morning 'cause of tonight and, well, these guys aren't exactly philanthropic. All right, well, uh, maybe I'll see you there. What, you're going to get those hands dirty? My hands have seen plenty of dirt, okay? Besides, you could use the help. Look, I'll have you know I'm preparing a workout routine. Oh, yeah, really? Yeah. I don't want to brag, But I'll be able to do, like, 100 pushups by the end of it. Yeah? And how many can you do now? Three. -Yeah, I'm coming! -Get home safe, Badi. -Sharon! -Sharon, sorry. Stop it. I'll back out, I swear. No take backs! Oh, look who finally decided to show up. Yeah, sorry, I kind of got caught up -with some YouTube videos. -Videos of what? -Protests and stuff. -What protests? You're joking. No, tell me. People in Iran aren't able to pay for things like food, rent, or gas, so they took to the streets. Actually? I had no idea. Yeah. It's happening a lot recently. The truck's here. Uh, you don't want-- You okay there, Hercules? Yeah, I'm fine. Use the dolly, you dummy. So, basically, you like-- you like, have a ball, and you, like, throw it to somebody and they, like, catch it in, like, a ring, and then you just kind of, like, do that. You know? It's a great game. You guys, you should-- What, to a goal at the other end or something? Yeah. That's what they told me. Highlight? I thought that was lacross. That's what I was thinking. So, what did-- what did you do yesterday? Actually, you know the guy I was telling you about? He's actually not as bad as I thought. Ooh, so... are you going to see him again? I don't know, I don't know, we didn't-- Oh, crap, it's him. -Well, answer it! - Hello? - Hey! Um-- I was just-- I just wanted to call you to, uh, ask a general question. One... Do you want to go out on Monday? Yes! Okay, great. Great. Pick you up at around 4:00? Sounds good. All right, cool. -Cool. -Cool. I mean, I already said cool, but, you know, I was just-- I'll hang up now. -Bye. -Bye. -Whoo! -That a boy! That's what I'm talking about! You are a closer! Hey! Hey. No screen peeking, bro. Hey, I'm not sneaky peeking, man. You're totally screen peeking here. He was, in fact, sneaky peeking. Shit. D'you hear that? Who are you? I'm-- I'm Sharon's, uh-- Badi. Sharon's buddy? No, sorry, my name is Badi. -Here, come in. -Thank you. -Tea? -Uh, no. I'm sure she's ready to-- - Sharon! - Coming. She's never had a Persian boyfriend before. No, I'm-- I'm not her boyfriend. - We're just kind of-- - Hey. Ready to go? Bye. Have fun on your date. Tape deck. Wow, Badi, so cultured. -It's my dad's car. -Right. -I don't really own any tapes. -Yeah, no, totally. Listen, it's cool, I get it. Now I know why you're so into my grandma. You're actually a 90-year-old Iranian man. You're just looking for a. Hah. All right. You know what, that's fine. Let's use that to attract some attention. Let's just get that... Very funny, very funny. Ah, ah! Absolutely hilarious. Badi, stop it. Stop it. I will jump out the window, I swear, I will open this window. Badi, I swear, I'll jump out the window. I'll do it. Yeah, a little bit. I don't know what a pupusa is. I don't know what a pupusa is. No, Badi, please don't. Excuse me, sir! -Do you know pupusa? -Hilarious. -Where can I get pup-- -Badi, stop it. He looked at me. You know, it worked out pretty well, even though the pupusa place is closed. It's all good. I love empanadas. I'm still kind of hungry though. - Yeah. - You know, we have time. We could go back, get some more if you want. You feel like Persian food? Uh... oh! There's actually a really good Persian restaurant nearby. They're called Shaza, and-- Wait! Shaza! No, no, that's not it, either, but you're right. - Sharon isn't my real name. - See, I knew it. Right, your real name is Shutangis. Oh, God, no. There's probably a real girl out there whose name is Shutangis. Yeah? Luckily, she isn't me. So, what's your real name then? Shirin. You know, I'll be calling you Shirin from now on. I'll allow it. Ooh! Look, check out the sultani. Oh! Oh, is that beef? Uh, yeah, yeah, I think-- I think so. Why, are you vegetarian? Oh, no, I'm just trying to cut down on red meat and stuff, so... Oh, and why is that? Cholesterol stuff, I don't know, I think it's healthier for you, so... Okay. Nah, well, I love bacon way too much to pass on red meat. Oh, no, you're not one of those people that puts bacon on everything, are you? -Yeah, I am. -Like, even salad? Bacon is amazing. Mm, well, salad doesn't have meat on it, so. Hi. Could we get two salad shirazis with extra bacon and extra cholesterol? So, what's your plan after med school? Honestly, I-- I don't know. I mean, I know want to help people. Through work or in general? Just thinking about my family back home. The situation there. I just really wish I could do something about it. Are you still close with them? Yeah, as much as I can. I mean, out of all my cousins-- which, there's a lot of them... it's just me and Arash. I guess that's why I kind of feel guilty every time I do something for myself. You can't take that on yourself. It just makes it really hard to-- you know, to take school and stuff seriously. The only real reason why I'm still in med school is because I know I'll be able to help my parents soon. I really like that about you. -What? -Just-- You have a sensitive heart. -I don't know about that. -No, I'm serious. I don't know, I just-- I just do what I need to do. What, are you afraid to be sensitive or something? Are you afraid of anything? -Disappointing my parents. -How? I mean, I get it, but what do you mean? That I might actually bail on real estate and... open up an art gallery or something. Aren't you more afraid of letting go of what you love? Hey. I mean, if real estate is what you want to do, then 100%, you should do that. But if painting and art is what you're passionate about, and it's what makes you happy... then you should do that. Promise me. What if my art sucks? Then you'll get better. And if it's those bougie art critics that are being jerks, we'll tell them to screw off. And what if it's my parents? Well, you-- They'll come around. They love you, right? Then they will. And I'll be there for you, promise. You're very... sweet. Question one, if you could host any dinner guest, alive or dead, who would you host and why? Khalil Gibran. I'd want to know who The Prophet was based on. What's a random quirk about yourself that people might not know unless they live with you? Uh... Oh, I only use small sized forks. Not the dinner ones, but, like, the tiny ones. They fit in my hand better. My family knows if you see all the big size cutlery, and then the small one, the small ones are mine. Stop it. That's not funny. That's cute. For what in your life are you most grateful? I'd say my parents coming here. It's like a massive gift. It's like... winning the lottery, but without buying a ticket. Look ahead - so you don't hit anyone. - I don't want to. Do you have a hunch on how you're going to die? A heart attack, for sure. Heart disease runs in the family. No, no, no. Ugh! What is this? Is this-- Do you write poetry? Look, it's nothing, okay? I've had it since I was, like, 16. Hey! Whoo! Day by day, they grew closer and closer, learning more about one another, including how Badi takes two sugar cubes with his chai. Can we get tea and some sugar cubes, please? Their friends were also drawing closer to their own passions. While Som was too high on saffron to realize that his passion had run empty. Aw, man. I got you, joonam. If a crystal ball could tell you anything about your life in the future, what would it be? Where I'm at when I'm 35. What life is like, like, what job I have. If I'm successful, if I became what I actually want to become. If my parents are okay. Oh, and the environment. How's the planet? There's no mention about kids anywhere in there? It crossed my mind, but-- I didn't want to know. I'd want it to be a surprise. All right, last part. We have to look at each other for four minutes... and not break eye contact. I love you. You know, that technically counts as losing eye contact. Ah! Who is going to school you in Halo -once you leave? -Hey, chill, bro. I won't be gone for a while, if at all. Yo, Badi, when do we hear back about these interviews? Like, a month or something, right? She didn't say it back. Okay, I'm not sure what this has to do with the interviews, but-- I told her I love her, and... she didn't say it back. Oh, damn, he's going through it. I'm sorry, you said what? -I told her I love her. -Why?! They've been dating for, like, four months. -Yeah, so? -She didn't say it back. Ah. You want to know why? Because you're soft, bro. Like a wrap. You don't know what that is, you stupid-- Look, Badi, you just gotta take it easy, man. All right? Don't let it get to your head. Kim already told me that Sharon is obsessed with you, bro. Don't overthink it. Well, have you guys said "I love you" yet? - No, bro. - See? Dude, what the hell? They call that busting his chops. Rostam! Hey, stranger. - Are you ready? - Mm-hmm. Oh, you smell nice. You got-- You got the smell from here? Yeah, I did. Ah, there is a new word. There is that word again. Uh, what's "taarof"? Look at that face. Another lesson, shall we? So, Shohreh assumed Shirin didn't want more because she was okay being a little hungry so that the family had more to eat. But a good host is okay being a bit hungrier so that the guests are well-fed. Wow. A lot of family interactions just made a lot more sense. "Too late." They don't know much about Canada's colonial exploits. You see? Yeah, yeah, I will. Where did you get those? -A tree. -Stop! Don't! Badi, stop it. What, you worried you're going to mess up your perfect look? How dare you besmirch my regal demeanor? -Regal? -Yeah. Well, tell me, Your Highness, do you feel like a commoner using the subway to go to Finch rather than calling a driver? I like to see how my subjects live from time to time. Still don't want to drive, huh? I get nervous. Well, in any case, I'm still really glad you came tonight. You-- It meant a lot to me. They make good food. I'll be back for sure. Well, maybe next time we could go to your place? I mean, I-- I still haven't met your dad yet. And with any luck, you never will. -Good night, Badi Joon. -Good night. Oh, remember to prep for your interviews tomorrow. I will. Jeez, why does everyone think I'm stupid? Wow. -Unbelievable. -Don't touch it! It doesn't say, "Don't touch." Yeah, but it's an artifact, you're not supposed to touch artifacts. There's tons of other artifacts here that-- -Don't touch anything. -It doesn't say anything! I'm going to touch it. It's beautiful, huh? You know, there's about two and a half thousand years of history. That's multiple thousands. An empire that invented social welfare, maternity leaves-- Shirin? Those are words. It's a poem by Rumi. "Intoxicated by the Goblet of Love, two realms slip from my hand. But mischief and deceit have had no accomplishment." And if you take a step back... it's a Sufi dervish. -It's beautiful. -Yeah. - Roonis at three o'clock. - Huh? Yeah, Roonis? Here we go again. Oh, yeah, for sure. Uh, speaking of Irooni, I wanted to ask you, do you know much about Persian poetry? At one point, a little bit, but I kind of grew out of it. Grew out of it? What's wrong with poetry? I don't know, it just kind of felt like some sort of airy fairy distraction. Distraction from what? Speaking from experience, all the stuff that's happening back home. Badi, you've been in Canada for, like, 13 years. This is your home. One of the first things someone asks you when you meet them for the first time is, "Where are you from?" It's not my home. You know, we are kind of like French. There's a lot of French in our language, so... You see? It's exactly what I was talking about. It's Tehranto Persian. You do realize I'm from Richmond Hill, right? It's not about you, okay? It's about the ones that come here. I'm sorry if the way we walk and talk isn't up to your standards. It's not about standards, all right? It's about owning your look, all right? Knowing your roots. Coloured contacts, nose jobs... tweezing our frickin' eyebrows. Badi, you don't know their experiences, okay? People have their reasons for wanting to fit in. Nobody wants to be a victim of racists. What's more racist than being ashamed of your own skin? -Oh, come on. -No, I'm serious. You can't hate your origins, you'll end up hating yourself. You're overreacting, we're all proud of where we come from, okay? Just in different ways. You seemed completely disinterested when I was teaching you about-- Teaching me? Badi, you don't need to mansplain my own heritage to me. When Iran turned its back on us, Canada opened its arms up. We should be grateful. Canada only boasts a multicultural image -out of self-righteousness. -So, leave! Look here, look how many brown, Black, and yellow people live here in Toronto. Oh, we're super multicultural, pay no attention to the residential school behind the curtain! If that's how you actually feel, then maybe you should go back. Once there's a revolution, I will. I'm so tired of this. You keep going on about a revolution that might never come, a thousand kilometers away, while ignoring all these issues right under your nose. You talk like you know what's best for a country you left 13 years ago. It's not your place. But you do live here now, so maybe give a damn about helping out your own community here. I'm-- Look, I'm sorry. I didn't-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry for unloading on you. It's just, my emotions, they get all bottled up, and I don't know what to do with them. Well... maybe it's a good idea to explore your emotions a bit, you know? Instead of grumbling around like an old man all the time. Yeah. Sorry, that last part was a joke. - Kind of. - No, it's fair. Look, it's tough. Iranian men aren't supposed to talk about emotions. "Intoxicated by the Goblet of Love"? Iranian men open up. I'm scared, Shirin. Of what? Of facing myself. Look, you wanted to ask me what I was most afraid of. And just letting out 25 years of emotion... and not knowing what to do with all this... built-up pain. Listen... I can't pretend to know what leaving Iran and growing up here was like. I'm not going to hold your emotions over you. Hi, Mom. - Where were you? - Out. Where out-out, Modar, every night? -With who? -Badi. -Badi kieh? -Mom, you've met him, like, -three times already. -The Persian guy? What happened to Adam the realtor? -Good night, Mom. -Maybe he can help you get your certificate. - Shirin. - Holy-- Mamanee, how long have you been standing there? I didn't even hear you. Wait, no, Mamanee-- No, you can't say anything. Okay? Maman can't know. I don't know if I can be a real estate agent. -Maman. -What's up? I have a bit of a problem. I was wondering if you could help. What is it? Your exam? No, no. It's about Badi. Oh, no. What happened? Nothing, nothing. Everything's fine. I just realized that if I wanted to keep moving forward, I have to grow with it. Okay? What are you trying to say? I want to have Badi over for dinner this weekend. And you want me to get your baba out of the house? -No, Maman-- -Out of town. That's not what I meant-- I don't know if I can do this. No, Maman, like a family dinner with you, me, Mamanee and Baba. -Well, Mamanee can't. -Why not? She has a heart doctor appointment. She's gonna be with him all day. Well, then you, me and Baba. Beben, azizem. - I'm open with you dating. - Yeah. Well, as long as it doesn't take your attention off of your real estate. But your baba is old fashioned. You know that, he's not gonna approve of Badi's background no matter what. Mom, I'm really serious about this. I like him a lot. That's your decision. Honey, I stand by you no matter what. I'm just... I'm worried that he's not going to like him. Well, that's between you and your baba. Just so you know. I think Badi's all right. Thanks, Maman. -Hi. Mr. Moridi. -Hey, Borat. Pleasure. -It's Badi. -That's nice. Come in. Mm. Oh, it's-- it's my dad's car. Oh, you don't have your own car? Well, I mostly use my bike. Oh. -This is for you. -Oh, I see. Badi Joon. Nice to see you. Salaam. - Please, just call me Tessa. - Okay. Come on in. Table is set already. And Sharon will be down in a minute. Okay, great. Thank you. That seat is for Sharon. Well, we are off to a good start. Sorry I'm so late. I was hoping it would force you guys to talk. Yeah, good job. Please, help yourself, everyone. Badi Joon, help yourself, please. I'm sorry? Never mind. It's-- It's really nice to finally meet you. Sharon's been telling us a lot about you. Really? Yeah. As of this last Monday. Uh-oh. She says you've been dating since last Nowruz. How come we're only just meeting now? Well, I-- I don't... If it were up to me, you would have known earlier. -How do you mean? -It's my fault. -I thought you'd freak. -Freak? Why would I freak? I'm cordial, I'm nice. Right? You're having a good time, Badi? -Yes, sir. -See? He's having good time, I'm having good time. Everybody's having a good time, right? Not me. I'm going to see myself out. So, when Fred used to live in Rome, he had this pet squirrel. Remember, honey? Out of curiosity, does your dad have another car? No, actually, that's the only one. Mm. Oh. I'm just-- I'm a big car man. Oh. Nice. But it's-- He got what he could. -Mainly uses it for work. -Okay. Tessa, can you pass me the salt, please? You don't need salt, honey. It's not good for your heart. Badi's dad is a really hard worker. I think you'd really like him. He-- He delivers pizza. It's not the most glamorous job, but it's humbling. I-- I just mean that he-- he makes enough to get by. And he's not jaded by having too much. What about your mother? No, sir. She's unemployed. Ah. What's your last name again? Ala-- Alavi. Oh, you're related to the Alavis from Isfahan? No, actually, my father's from a small town, Lalejin, just outside of Hamadan. We knew someone from Lalejin, didn't we? Yeah, I think so. Father's kolfat. What does kolfat mean? I don't miss having helping hands around. We actually had this chef when we were living in Paris. -Remember, honey? -Tessa. He used to come by-- Badi doesn't want to hear about our boring stories from abroad, you know? -We have too much. -Fred. I'm sorry, did I miss something? No, you didn't miss anything. I'm just saving you some time. Because it's not going to interest you. Baba. I don't think that's necessarily true, sir. What? Let's just stop beating around the bush, okay? I mean, look, you seem nice. I don't know what you expected here when you came, but culturally we're too different. This is clear, right? Tell me, has your family been to Rome? No. -Paris? -No, but-- - Dusseldorf? - No. But that doesn't mean that they won't. -Who's gonna pay? -Actually, I will. How? He's studying medicine. -Oh, it means you're broke. -Excuse me? And you plan on flying around the world with what? - Your student loans? - Fred. Maybe you should just take it easy. Tessa, if a man comes into our house saying he's interested in our daughter, I expect him to be able to provide for her. - I can provide for myself. - Stay out of it. Look, I get it. Okay? You're young, probably in love, but you need to be pragmatic. Both of you. Okay? The truth is that you're still a student and pretty soon your parents are going to be counting on you, especially considering your father's line of work and the fact that your mother doesn't even have a job. You know what? I don't have to explain this to you. - Screw it. - Excuse me? I'm not going to sit here while you turn your nose up against my family. And at least they're proud of where they come from... Fred. What? You think you know me? You have no idea what we've been through. I know you're an Iranian man who's ashamed of his own blood. My blood? My blood. What do you know about my blood? And why would I be ashamed of my blood? The Shah held court for us. I'm not ashamed to admit that to the son of a damn kolfat. -Baba. -That's enough of that. Thank you very much for the amazing dinner. -I'm sorry. -You're saying sorry to her? I'm just trying to be cordial. What's your problem? I have no reason to be cordial with you, boy. You know what? Go fuck yourself. Sir. Get out of my house! - Badi! - I can't! Come back! You let him talk to me like that. I'm sorry! Badi! I'm sorry! Come on. I'm not going to be around forever and I don't want her to be spending her life without a provider. I want her husband to come from a strong family. Hey, wait, Sharon. Hey. Sharon! She missed him, wishing they could just talk. But Badi couldn't bring himself to answer, drowning over the guilt of his words at dinner. It was cruel. Sharon had never felt pain like this before. I've never felt pain like this before. She was certain of it. Yup. Definitely not. Hello. You just called me. That one was a butt dial. It'll be okay. You're gonna get through this, I promise. Yeah. And, you know, we'll help you get back into things. Here, give me your phone. I'll download Tinder. -Jess! Are you stupid? -What? If she's lucky, she'll see Adam McSackling on there. Okay? He's a very successful realtor. I need some air. No, no, no. You stay. Sit there and don't move until you figure out exactly what you did wrong. Badi. Bro. I'm beggin' you, man. Listen to me. -What the-- -I dunno. Bro, our interviews are today. You know that, right? Kooft. Persian is a poetic language. Here is an example. To express love for someone we say, "Ghorbunet besham," which means, "I will sacrifice myself for you." So, the lack of poetry says a lot when Badi says, "Go "F" yourself," to Sharon's father. I'm sorry. You said what? Bro. This is our only shot. Dude, I gotta go. If he snaps out of it-- Yeah, yeah, I'll send him over. Good luck, bro. Thanks. So, I've been hearing these voices in my head. Is that normal? -Yeah, I'll take one. -Two empanadas. No, just one, please. Two empanadas coming right up, sweetheart. Uh, no. Sorry, sir, just, can I have-- Okay. Two empanadas. - These are on the house. - Okay. My mom owns this place, so, no big deal-- That's nice. Thank you. No problem. Treat 'em with respect. Treats you the same way. Just like any tool... you gotta take care of it. You know why they got them lights up there? Uh... No. 'Cause they look nice? To detract people from committing suicide. Pleasant. Jesus. What the hell are you still doing here? Kim said not to get up until-- Get the hell out. I don't know. Maman Joon. This is not your fault, okay? I tried that with her. Badi Joon. How do you do it? I don't think I can do that. At least not right now. Yeah. Hey, guys, do your part, save your city. Come on. Hey. Save your city. No. Okay. Oh! Dude, save your city! What the hell, man? Dr. Urowitz. I was wondering if I could-- Mr. Alavi, I received your email and unfortunately, there's nothing I can do. You had an interview and you missed it. Look, at least just give me the chance to change your mind. The parking garage is five minutes from here. And we walk at my pace. All right, well sir, growing up in Iran was really tough. We never really had much, we were under constant pressure. And my family had to sell everything on their backs to get me here. And now you're here. What's your point? Well, now they're old. I really can't do my residency at any other hospital. It has to be in Toronto. So, you shouldn't have missed your interview. Sir-- Sir, will you-- I-- I really need this. You're absolutely horrible at changing people's mind, you do realize that? Okay, well, you have a wife, right? A husband. What's your point? Well, what if your husband, he-- He died. Well, before. We separated before he died. You still have the ring? Yes, of course, it's a very nice ring. Okay, well, what if your husband separated on a day you had an important procedure? Would you be able to carry out on a clear mind? Look, don't you want candidates who can admit when their emotions might compromise their ability to carry out their work? And who can take a step back when it's right to do so? Yes, of course, but we're also looking for people with conviction. Which is exactly why I'm here. -Thomas. -Dr. Urowitz. You made it to your interview, correct? Yes, sir. How well do you know Badi? We've met. -Has Badi ever let you down? -No, sir. - I'm sorry. What is this about? - Hmm. If he did, do you think you'd give him a second chance? Yeah, I don't see why not. Hmm. Badi, you owe Thomas a beer. Come and see me on Friday. Wait, Friday? Uh, yes. I-- Listen, I'll look after everything else. Just do yourself a favour and do not miss your interviews -with the other hospitals. -Thank you, doctor. How was your night, Sharon? What's the matter? You still mad at me? No, she's just probably stressed. It has been so cold outside. Yeah? -May I be excused? -Sure. Sharon, please, sit down. No. This is all your fault. -Excuse me? -Stop it. You always fall into the same routine when someone vaguely defies you. I'm done being afraid of you. You made Badi say things that he can't take back. It meant losing my boyfriend. And losing respect for you. Hey, Sharon. Sharon! You should go talk to her. Tessa, just don't get involved, yeah? Look at me, look at me. Sharon. Sharon, I... You know, I used to be able to hold you in my hand. Your whole body in my hand. You were born early and... it was only by a few weeks, but... it scared us. It scared me. Those first nights in the hospital, I was just glued to the incubator, just watching your little breaths. And I wanted to break through that glass and I wanted to bring you home. I wanted to protect you. Life was really tough for me and your mother in Europe. So, we came to Canada. We thought we could be ourselves. You know? We made certain that you knew how to speak Farsi, you knew your language, your culture, your roots, you know? Until one day, maybe you're five, six years old and... you came home one day, and... you were hungry. I opened your lunchbox. Your food is still there. And I said, "Shirin, why didn't you eat your lunch?" And then you burst out crying and you put your face in my arms. And you say that the kids, they're making fun of you. They say your food is vomit and you felt so embarrassed and so much shame. And it wasn't your fault... to feel that, it's my fault. It just brought back everything I went through, what your mom went through. And I said, "No." That's it. Enough. Why are we trying to hold on to something and be something for people who don't even care about us? Huh? And that was that. We stopped calling you Shirin. We started speaking English at home. And every day after that, I did everything I could to protect you. But... all I ended up doing was just driving you further away and causing you more pain than any of those kids at that school. I made a lot of sacrifices to protect you, to protect our family. And I don't regret any of them. Except at dinner that night. You opened up your heart to us. And I just pushed you away. Look Thomas, thanks for saving my ass back there. Nah, man, you probably would've done the same for me. Honestly, I'm not too sure. I just feel like-- like I'm in this weird situation where I got conflicting views from Iranians that are born here versus the ones that are actually from there and... I guess it just gave me a bad view of Canadians. Listen, my mom's Jewish and my dad's Catholic. So, I kind of grew up with half the family always being suspicious of the other half. I just-- I try to keep things grounded. Anyway, sorry about earlier, I mean, I was trying to catch up to Dr. Urowitz and I did not mean to smack all your stuff out your hand, man. I figured you really had to be somewhere if you were just gonna, like, pile drive me and just keep on running. Yeah. What are these, anyway? Yeah, there are a bunch of condo proposals going up in the Persian District. I heard about that. -Are they going through? -Probably. But there is a town hall meeting coming up. You should come. Man, look, we're losing all of our cultural touchstones that make up Toronto. Can I keep this? Yeah. Yeah, all good. I got lots. Well, anyway, I'm this way. But thanks again, man. I owe you. Yeah, don't mention it. Oh, my brilliant base. Oh, my warmth within. Ode to my fearless faith. With pacing prospects in peace. In dearest disposition. And distanced disaster. Still the heart beats much faster. Oh, my shady shard. Oh, my. Ode to my fright of forlorn with motionless mind, at war. In distanced disposition and dearest disaster, still the heart beats much faster. Feeling exciting scares and scary excitements, the heart invites you to a warm embrace, with hopes of one day slowing its pace. And yet, still the heart beats much faster. - Okay. - Uh-huh. What? Absolutely not. Mom. Oh, now I'm your mom? I just find out you got your certificate months ago. You knew? I thought you failed and you needed more time. I was giving you space. You keep twisting her. You want to make her your little clone. Why leave Iran if you wanted all of us to keep pretending we were still living there? They went mad when they were out of the country. They turned their back on us. You want her to be like them? -Okay, Mom. -"Them"? You forced Farsi. You forced Farsi on her. You pushed her into this doomed relationship. Now you're encouraging her to leave a real job for this finger painting fairy tale? Hey, hey! She's my daughter, not yours! Okay, that's enough, Mom. Okay? I'm done with you controlling my life. You're manipulative and all you care about-- Tessa. Sharon. Dokhtarem, azizem, I'm doing all this for you. Well, you never gave a damn about anybody but yourself. - You hid the good-- - Tessa! Badi's pride helped me find my real passions. And it's not real estate. I loved him and I never even got the chance to tell him. - Fred? - Dad? - Oh, my God, Fred! - Baba. Feridun, azizem, can you hear me? Maman, call 911. That'll take too long. Help me get him into the car. Patient is 44-year-old male, history of heart disease. Suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Angiogram will offer further details. Good. Thank you, Jackie. You okay? You all right? You're gonna be fine. Just deep breaths, Badi, deep breaths. All right? That a boy. All right. Now, we'll let you handle the sutures on this one. For now, you're an extra pair of hands, just passing us anything that I or any member of the surgical staff ask for. -You got it? -Yes, sir. All right. Good man. Let's do it. Okay, thank you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy. I need you to-- I need you to remain calm for us, okay? -Not him. -What's that? Can I please have another doctor? -Not him. -Fred, listen to me, okay? Everything's gonna be just fine. This is Badi. He's a resident-- Different doctor. Can we get him sedated, please? You're dead. You're so dead. No, I'm just kidding. That's not how it happened. Just one more doctor-- Can we get him sedated, please? We'll get you to your family, sir. I promise. -You good to go? -Yes, sir. All right, let's do this. On three, everybody. Nice and gentle. One, two, three. - Sharon! - Kim. He just texted me. -Hi. -Hi. -Is there any news? -He's still in there. - Hey, Sharon. - Hey. Look, there's something you should probably know. -There's a slight chance that-- -Mr. Moridi's family? Yes, doctor. That's us. How is he? Well, Fred's heart showed a little more blockage in the arteries than we had at first thought. And as a result, the operation took a couple of hours longer than we'd anticipated. He did suffer some damage to his left subclavian artery as a result of the heart attack. But we were able to clear a nice little path using some stents. All in all, I think the-- the operation was a success. So, he's all right? Yes, yes, he's all right. -Thank you so much, doctor. -You're very welcome. I'm gonna go for a walk. Maybe I find a balloon or something. He'll be here when you get back. No, wait, he's waking up! A balloon is a good idea. Hi, Baba. Hi. You scared us. I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. If you ever do that again, I'll kill you. Mm... that sounds nice. Shirin. Hi. Hi. I heard that you were... It looks amazing. Thanks. I know I'm early, but I can come back-- No, no, it's fine. I wanted to give you something. Oh. That's sweet. You didn't need to. I wanted to. Poetry? Yeah. You... kind of sparked something in me that I didn't know was still there, and... I knew you were doing calligraphy so I thought it might help. Maybe I shouldn't have come. I'm sorry. -This is stupid. I'm sorry. -Wait. Why did you come? -I promised you I would. -What? I told you that if you were ever in a gallery, I'd... Here I am. - It's just-- - I know, I know-- What am I supposed to say? You have every right -to be angry at me. -Don't. -I'm sorry. I just-- -Sorry? You left me. You didn't think to follow up after that dinner? Are you kidding? Every day. Then where were you? I missed you. I really did. You know, but at the same time, when you left the way that you did, it hurt. And it really pains me to tell you all this because I know you're a tremendously sensitive soul, but I have to tell you how I feel. You're right. Before we met... there was this part of me that I hated. Spending time with you brought me new life. You know what's messed up? Is that even after you left, I still held out hope. But you didn't show. I texted you. I called you. I sent you a damn email. I read every single one of them-- Then why weren't you there? Because I... I don't know. I acted like an ass. And-- And you are an amazing person who deserves an amazing partner. You don't get to decide that for me. I wasn't. It was for me. For years, I've been trying to bury how I feel-- Don't use your insecurity as a scapegoat. Just give me a chance, okay? You... created inspiration for me. And when I saw our future get rattled, I... I was broken. I would have been there for you. Look, Badi, as hard as things got for me, all I wanted to do was run over and make sure you were okay. That's not for you to do. There were things I still needed to figure out for myself. You were the one that told me to come to terms with who I am. And explore my emotions. So, what? You're seeing a therapist? Well, no. I-- Well, in hindsight, that would have made things a lot simpler. I'm doing poetry again. Art as a therapy. Everything does look great, by the way. Beautiful. I'm sorry. I'm happy you came. A little early, but still. No, a little late. I should finish setting up but you're welcome to stay, obviously. No, I mean, I should probably get going. I don't want to make things anymore awkward. No, no, no. It's fine. Look, we're expressing ourselves. It's healthy, I promise. But I should warn you that... this doesn't mean I'm going to be chasing you. That's fair. The ball's in your court. Bye, Badi. Bye, Shirin. It was a lesson for them both that self-growth isn't done for another person. It's done for oneself. Hey, don't feel cheated. I didn't lie to you. The truth is, this is a love story, and one most of us have known. When they met, they were but two budding blossoms. And it was by their time together that they bloomed in their time apart. Yo. So, what happened? Who you callin', man? Did you forget something?
