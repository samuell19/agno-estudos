Why wasn't Anita invited? - Anita wasn't there. - She wasn't there? What do you mean? She was there! Remember... when she played with herself in the director's office? I remember, but it wasn't that day. - Are you sure? - She's right. You are confusing two sit-ins there. - Really? - Because there... Yes, we spent the night at the university. It always struck me how quickly... you settled in to a new place. I adapt quickly to new places. I don't really know him. We were both activists... and he plays squash with my brother in-law. Martha made empanadas that night. Do you know how I remember? Everytime an empanada burns my mouth, I get d?j? vu... No, you are getting confused. I can't even do the fold. These new earrings are irritating me. You know I never wear bijouterie. I loved it. We all loved it. Carla... Leonardo, a friend. You remember that book, "The Rice Family"? - We loved it. - Thank you. - Bye. - See you later. What are you writing now? I saw you recently. Yes, in an interview in... Is it autobiographical? Leonardo, why not come to one of my group therapy sessions? We discuss a lot of your work. Come along! Men like you leave completely transformed. I really liked your last work, but the otherone... had something that made me cry. This one didn't. Yes, it's not an autobiography... but you write about yourself. Would you consider coming to see a musical... - Broadway style? - No, Leonardo doesn't like musicals. He just cringes, he can't keep it in. He hates singing actors. It's like being naked. Leo! How about changing places fordessert? - So we can talk... - Yes, why not. I need to tell you something interesting... for you only. No smile? Leonardo, we're discussing this with Mabel... and we can't agree. How do you define yourself? Is it a comedy or a drama? What are you exactly? A global artist, an audiovisual writer? - Well, definitions... - You know what he thinks. - He doesn't consider himself an artist. - No? No. He thinks that art... is not a gift but more a trade. A productive habit, right? And your little girl, Leonardo? Boys are more like scientists. But the girl? - Julia. - Yes, Julia. - She likes art? - I don't think so. More into science, actually. I don't think she's into art. - We don't know. - Well, we don't know. My daughter's got talent. Give her a recorder, a bongo, an accordion. She'll play. Leave this family stuff be! What are you talking about? Kids, you know? How they start something... and never finish it. Just like you, Martha. You were a brilliant student and then... nothing. I just mean that you didn't graduate... About the holidays. We were talking... about renting a big house in the beach. From the University, too? A teacher? No, no, I'm just Edith's husband, "Pielcita". Dr. Spivak, a pleasure. - Like wise. A doctor? - Neurologist. Alzheimer's, dementia generally. And you? - Playwright. - Oh, a poet. Martha's husband. And do you work in a hospital? No, I don't. I do research... into complex memory problems, but it's very boring... It's not very entertaining. Please. I'm all ears. - It's very theoretical. - I'm interested. I'm studying a very rare phenomenon now. Few get it but those who do deteriorate significantly. These people start to remember their deepest desires, their fantasies, as if they were real, as if they had been fulfilled and are now part of their memory. In other words, the person wrongly thinks he or she had these experiences. And why? No idea. That's why I'm studying it. - I have my theory. - Leonardo... If we can't retain our experiences, at least we retain our fantasies. Understand? I think you're wanted. Leonardo, when are you coming to see my daughter on stage? She'd be honored. Which play is it? - "The Junk Factory". - Oh! I've seen it. - Sure. - When? - Must have been... two weeks ago. - And? Good, very good. A very interesting experience... - Admirable work. - ?Oh! It's clear that... - Oh! I'm going to tell her. - Tell her congratulations. Why not play the piano here? No... I should pick it up again. - We are waiting. - Ultimately I'm... I'm insecure about my voice. I've drunk abit. I need some fresh air. He's outstanding. He deserves applause. To the theater, no! I already told her I saw it. I won't seat in those seats for hours, forget it. Leave the radio on! I do what I want with my time. I know how to say"no". Clearly. She can play in our living room, if she wants. I'll sit in my armchair. Show me an accountant, a lawyer, a dentist. If your friends' daughters study something useful, - I'll see them. - That stupid face you pull... when you are asked about your profession! As if you're free ofit. - It's aphobia. - No, it's not! A phobia is not being able to board a plane. - Yours is vanity. - Next time... why don't you just go alone? You answer everything and everyone, always interrupting, of course. Why do you take me? It's your graduating class. No, just from the university. I didn't even graduate. Of course! They're all qualified sociologists... And what do they do? Get up in the morning, gaze at their diploma... Do sociologists see their patients in a practice or in an office? They don't see patients! Singing actors don't bother me, it's the dancing... What's wrong, Martha? You want to tidy up now? Don't wake them up. She'll be late. They are at a party. - They? - He picked her up and will drop her off. - He has a car? - No. No, he came in a taxi. He doesn't smoke. - And he writes, too. - How nice. I told you, you don't listen. I told you she wasn't coming home tonight. What does that mean? That she sleeps elsewhere? ?Or that she'll be up all night but not at home? Leonardo, kids go out on Saturday. They have fun, they laugh, they fuck. That's what Saturdays are for. Remember? Do I need to know when my daughter is having sex? I'll wait up for her. You're tired. You can go to bed. I'm tired? What does it matter? I'll stay up and write. Since when, at night? Since now. Since I came home at dawn to find my daughter not at home. The first time she hasn't slept here. You knew and didn't tell me. I'm her father. Suddenly so important. Why didn't you go down when he came? I know you're her father. Martha, if I manage to write down this idea... I will become an extraordinary father, like Charles Ingalls. Honestly, just... leave me for one minute in peace. I'm going to bed, I'm tired. Stay in that armchair. It has your shape by now. A MAN AND A WOMAN... FLOATING IN WATER ARE THEY DEAD? - Well? - They are in the air by now. When do they arrive? Wednesday morning, but forus... It's still Tuesday. Well, we'll have to get used to it. Our children will be a day ahead. - They'll read the papers before us. - Lanib asked why you stayed behind. Yanif's bags filled the car. Should I have gone by taxi? - It's lanib, Leonardo! - Yannib... Yan... I don't know. Is it an "Y" oran "I"? I can't pronounce it. It's difficult. He could have had a name like Juan, Pedro, David. - A name you can pronounce... - What a disgrace! What a disgrace to not even say good bye to your daughter! I did, at home. Don't shout. Yes, I'm shouting! Because now I can! I've wanted to shout for years! But I couldn't... The kids were sleeping, or you were writing... - and you couldn't be bothered... - Martha, please! Isn't it odd? Or is it a coincidence? That all three chose careers that can only be pursued... six thousand miles away from their parents? Where did we go wrong? Always so worried about not yelling in front of the kids. Julia's left with a man whose name you can't pronounce! Lanib... lanib... I don't know how we can go on like this. - Like what? - It's always the same. I'm the one who has to say things. I'm the one yelling, but if I don't, then things don't get said! WRITER'S GUILD Afternoon... Got anything forme? Is there a problem? I was expecting more. I'm due some royalties from France. It's come to a stand still with France. Wait for Norita. Let's see what can be done. Writing? Yes, writing. THE EMPTY NEST by IANIB RICHTER To Julia, who gave me her Gift. [The thirty six colors of the desert) SARAH'S SMILE Leonardo? - Hi! - How are you? - Is that yours? - No, no. It's by my son in law. - Registering something? - No, retirement stuff. What? You can claim your pension at 55 here. Good, eh? I don't know about you, but I wrote my best stuff at 30, then it was autopilot. It suits me well... because I had a brain hemorrhage a while back, did you know? Can't use my head now. - So what do you do? - I'm in advertising. Still got some brain cells left forit. And for fucking too. I'll tell you about it now. Do you want a coffee? I'm free until midday. Vindel, Leonardo. 5th. ODONTOLOGY CONFERENCE DR. ROSA E?E CERTIFICATE OF ATTENDANCE DR. E?E Excuse me. I'm here to see Dr. E?e. I've been sitting here... Where's the doctor? In the Canary Islands, at a symposium. How odd you got an appointment. She won't be back till... If she's way over there, she won't be back for a while. Well, then... I'll come back when the symposium finishes. I made a specific appointment. A delicate matter. She was recommended to me... as a specialist in the field. I came by recommendation. I saw her diplomas. She's already seen me once. This is Dr. E?e's practice, but she doesn't necessarily see all the patients. - Of course. - She supervises. I'm Dr. Alterini, from her team. Thank you, but I don't like to switch. I could see any doctor, but my problem is very delicate. The nerve goes right through here. I don't want to take risks. A junior doctor couldn't treat me. Do you understand? You have a "diastema" in the upper maxilla. It was less serious in the past, but it's gotten worse with age. We could put in some transparent braces, then use a retainer, which is a little wire that... - Stabilizes. - Exactly. Teeth tend to return to their original position in time. Yes, Dr. E?e said the same thing. I asked her... to use the ones that go behind the teeth. That's more complicated and uncomfortable. It damages the tongue... and the treatment is longer and expensive. It's only recommended for famous people, when appearance counts. But I am famous. In a different way, a different field. I'm a writer, a playwright. Okay. Then speak with Dr. E?e. She's an expert in the technique. That lisp you have will go, too. See? The air slips through there. Ah! S... s... Salami. - Do you smoke? - No. Why? Because ofthe color of the enamel? I used to smoke. Don't tell me it's my age as well. I gave up a while ago but... the smoke stayed with me. Does the treatment hurt? The first week is difficult. There's some pain when you eat, new sensations, abrasions. But take a sublingual painkiller, and you'll be fine. A little irritable maybe. When can I start? When the doctor comes back. You can't do the treatment? How about today? I meet my family later on. Tell me I'll be fine... and it'll be a secret. Judith came here to feel better. Since the kids went away... they had a lot of arguments about the business, which didn't happen before. She feels being left alone with the bookshop. - Stationery shop. - Stationery, sorry. Stationery shop. They turn up late, don't pay the bills... Simon, who is... Simon is Judith's husband. He doesn't support her. - He's irritated, irritable... - Okay, okay. Good, you did very well. Thank you. Well done. But remember, it's important not to judge him. Just tell the other person's story. - Let's continue with Pedro. - Pablo. Sorry, Pablo. Whose story do you have? - Martha's. - Good. Martha is alive wire. Active, over whelming... He knows you better than me. A "live wire"... She got engaged very young... and eventually married Leonardo, whom some of you may know as he writes... plays. That's not important, Pedro. I mean, Pablo. You present Martha. In just five minutes. Okay, in short: Martha married Leonardo, they had three children, she loved being a mother and companion, especially as he... we can't discuss him, focused more on his career than home life, and she had to give up her studies... to be with him and look after the kids. - Fine, good. It's clear. - Is it? But she feels that this sadness that takes over her every so often... - Well, sorry, but... - Martha, it's fine. Is basically a product... of this frustration, this resignation, this sacrifice. I don't know you, but your eyes show a mutilated woman. Martha, can we discuss this at home? You told me we came for help. Please, please... Allow me to point out, Leonardo, that you're judging. Your angeris a product of the mind. - This is a place for realization. - No, it's just a minute. No, I'm not angry. No. I need to clarify something, because there are things that... when said a certain way, may look different, coming from someone who is a complete stranger. He isn't! Can't you wait? There are group rules! - Martha, please... - He doesn't get it. Don't look at me like that! What do you know about us? You talk to her five minutes... Leonardo! Let him speak! I can't speak now? Sorry, sorry. I don't want to mess up the rules of the game. I'll wait my turn. It's fine. I found out that a lot of the courses I took still count. All I'd need are two semester courses and one year-long one. It's not that complicated, right? You could start as an auditor. If you like it, you can enroll next year. I start on Monday. - In the morning? - No, I enrolled in night classes. One is more productive in the morning. At our age... Yes, but morning people are always very young. And I'm better in the evening. When I studied, it was like that. Half way through the year? Odd... - Which campus? - Leonardo! - Paula, this is Paula. - Hi. - How are you? - Leonardo, old pal! While brainstorming at the agency, I dropped your name and they loved it. "Clean" Women: Ten women in ten days. Ten "Clean" women! It's bathroom soap but I think... it can apply to underwear. Real good. - We'll even do it in high definition. - Thanks, Ra?l... but I've never done advertising. They have different rules, ways... It's good money. "Clean" women. It's in English, it means clean women. Are you into sports? Not there, no. Excuse me. Follow me. No... Not there. Here... The last one. No, no, the desk won't go through here. Keep going. I'm going through here. Hello... Julia! What a coincidence. I was just in your room. I was thinking about moving my study. You can't smoke in this house. Here, have one. Always in a rush. Are the days shorter over there? What kind of photo? What's it for? If I know what it'sfor, I can choose the best one! Childhood? Yes, I'll send it. Tell me something. Have you found an apartment? I'll get your mother. As for the photo, that's fine. Don't ask her for it, too. - Julia. - Hello? It just fits in my room, against the window. You want to have your office here? It's furniture! It can be moved. And it's a study, not an office! Don't buy so many croissants, you know I don't eat them anymore. Freeze the rest. The window won't do. The wall belongs to the trust. You can't make holes wherever you want. You never listen! That's the problem. Will it all fit? The mind deteriorates without challenges, so we recommend stimulation. For example, you are a poet, so try something rational. Learn to play chess, bridge, sudoku once in a while. On your way to work, you can walk... and count the numbers on the taxi plates. - I work at home now. - Well... Stimulate the non-dominant side of your brain. You're right-handed, so use your left hand. Open doors or... What's it called? - Brush your teeth. - Yes, do that. - Are you reading abook now? - No, it's... My son in law wants an opinion. I think it's a novel. When I write... or wrote, I concentrated for brief moments. Now I can't. It's impossible at home. Bars are smoky or they stink. - Martha? - She's not good. She's very excited. I don't mean sexually excited... although a little, yes. Anxious. She's anxious, hyperactive. She fills the house with people. - You still love each other? - Yes! I ask because some couples take years to realize... what they had doesn't exist anymore. Like when you store things away... - just in case you need them. - Precisely! Couples believe that their children are to blame for all crisis. It doesn't matter if they're there, or if they're gone. That's not it. You have to revive the relationship, rediscover each other. Discover new perspectives together. Be careful. Some will say... that the answers lie in a self-help book, or in taking your wife to a hotel, or buying a kilo of ice cream... like when you were dating. I'm afraid the solution is a little more sophisticated. It takes time, effort, creativity. You use your imagination in your work. Why not use it in daily life? That ice cream thing could work, eh? Excuse me. Hi, darling! Look who's here! Hey, Leonardo! Welcome. Let's see what an artist reads. Leo! Can we talk later? Tomorrow they open it up. You see the lines? - Double glazed. - Great. - Great, yes. - And the view? Wonderful. The third and fifth floor have one. - You can't do it... but you can. - Martha, the empanadas! Coming! I'll be back. We got married to have sex. But have you seen the kids nowadays? In the living room, the bathroom... An empanada? - Fernando! Come here, sing something. - No, I'm fine here. It's okay. - A bird! - A fish! An eagle! - Good evening, sir. - Let's put it... Can we throw out some croissants? - No, no, leave them. It'll fit. - The older ones... There. That's it. Seagull! Dove! Thank you. Thanks. - Yes? - May we? Hi. How are you? - I'm Fern?n, a good friend of Martha. - I'm In?s. "Good friends" at school, then fellow students at the university. - Of course, nothing to hide now. - Leonardo... Remember? Fernando, Rafael, In?s, Sociology... We want to meet more often. Yes, "good friends. " We already met. Did he tell you that? Did you tell him that? We didn't even get to first base! I've forgotten already. Just to break the ice. We'll be meeting more often. Does it bother you? I saw ashtrays so I assumed I could smoke. No. I gave up and no one smokes in the house. And, if you don't mind, it's not an ashtray, it's a present from my son. Fernando. "Happy Father's Day. " See? - How nice... - Fernando? Same name as me? It wasn't because of me? You claim not to remember but... Fernando was Leonardo's uncle. He died and... - Leonardo loved him a lot. - Sorry. - Anyway, let's get going. - Yes... You stay. You're already dressed for bed. - Does he write there? - Sometimes... - Did that hurt? - No. We close. Any discomfort? Don't worry. The teeth are more important. Let's see... - Do you have a practice? - No. - Where do you hang your diplomas? - At home, for now. A shame. I like to see the diplomas. It soothes me. Are you wearing perfume? No, not when I'm working. I thought you were. - You driving? - No. I think I'm going the other way anyway. - What'd she buy? - Nuts. For me, too. Martha? Good afternoon. Hi, guys. How are you? - Hi... - Sugar-roasted nuts. I have too few to offer any. Leonardo. My husband. There you go. Why not put out some croissants? Later. I write, too. I'd love to show you something. Sure! Give it to Martha. I do all my work through Martha. Let's carry on. We don't know if their descendents... Yeah, son, but listen... You definitely sent it to me? What was it? What? A surprise? Well, let's pretend it's a surprise. No, no news from your brother. I call him, but it's always night time. I speak to amachine. Do you two talk at all? It's fine, go. Yes. Yeah, okay. Bye, bye. Me too. Bye. Yes, Yanif! Lanib! How are you? Yes, it's Leonardo. How's it going? Yes, but getting there is difficult. Has it calmed down now? Yes, thanks. Take care. Julita, my daughter! How are you? Your mother's well, yes, good. She'll call tonight. Busy with her things, but good. I prefer it like this, from abooth. It's quieter. What's wrong? Yes, writing... stuff. Yes, tell lanib in his language... that I'm reading it. I need some peace so I can finish it. I know my opinion is important to him. Sure. Did you get the photo? You look so pretty! Why can't it be with your father, your one and only? Yes, I know you're late, darling. I'm sorry. I'll find another photo. Bye, go... CLEAN WOMEN THE EMPTY NEST You're right next to the smoking section. - Thanks. - Not at all. Is this yours? No, it's by a relative. - Do you read other people's work? - Yes. I'm also a writer. Poetry. I used to do prose but not anymore. I can leave something here for you to read. During the week, whenever you have the time. - Okay. - And tell me your opinion. - Of course. - Thank you. - Leo! How's it going? - Say hi to Martha! Leonardo! Hi! I've got my car. Want a lift? I was so relaxed. I let myself go. You do it without thinking. - And what did she say? - Honestly, I don't know her. Even now I'm not sure if it really happened or not. It sounds more like a fantasy. It's common for men of our age. - No medical concern. - Tomato sandwich. Tomatoes have as much water... as we do, size wise. Curious. Particularly the plum tomato. It did really happen. It wasn't a big deal... but I liked it, and it disturbed me. I didn't feel guilty. No, it definitely happened. It must have, because now I've got braces. See? They're hidden on the inside. It doesn't matter. I'd like it to happen one more time. Just one more time and that's it. To complete the experience, you see? That smell, that skin... There's an exercise that's useful... for putting things into perspective. "Die gew?nschte Auswirkung". From the Vienna School. It means "the desired effect". The ideais that in front a scenario such as this, you imagine every detail... and masturbate as if doing it. Then you stop for five minutes, you picture the situation again, and compare the feelings. Sounds good, but with which hand? The non-dominant? What I need now... is your opinion on this relationship. Just as a friend. Leave the doctor aside. You mentioned fulfilling desires. Exactly. I think you didn't get it. On the contrary. I don't know how to thank you. Leave it, please. I'll pay. That's it. Now... I've got to go. Hi. This is Martha. I can't answer because I'm studying. Call later. UNIVERSITY DISTRICT This is a discourse with double meaning. That is, confusion. So, a discourse with double meaning. Who's talking? "It's me. The unfortunate one". "Lost in every way and tortured... " "by every blessing indisguise", he says, and the other replies: "Be brave. Don't despair". That's the discourse... That is the discourse of double meaning, or confusion. It therefore creates complicity... You're looking beautiful. What luck. I'm your wife. I'll be home late. We're going fora drink after the exam. - Good luck! - Thank you. Hello! Fernando! She's just left. Yes, she's very well. Not just the window. She's got friends at the university. She's a live wire. It didn't arrive? Your brother got it two days ago and he's further away. I'm fine. Writing, yes, writing. Well, in the process of thinking. I can't discuss it hurriedly over the phone. What? What book? Oh, Yanif's? Yes, I'm starting it. Oh yes? What did you think? Sensational? Yes, of course I'll read it. If everyone's crazy about it, the best-seller of the family. No, I've got some exercises to do from the doctor. No, I'm okay, no... It's for draining, I mean, for improving lucidity, with the non-dominant hand, a prophylactic measure. CLEAN WOMEN What'd they say? - No, it didn't work. - Why not? Very chauvinistic, sexist. We want to address real women, not smells. The flying noses were too much. Too much? I can show you the Power Point... Don't bother. The flying noses are too aggressive. And who drew them? Did you see the drawings? I drew them, as a graphic idea ofit. - Did you realize? - It's just a mock-up. For the client they're anti-Semitic caricatures. They're normal noses. They can be Christian noses... Me, anti-Semitic? My daugther lives with an Israeli! - So what? - He'd know! - What, no anti-Semites in Israel? - Never been there... They didn't get it! Now imagine that you've all gone blind... after an atomic explosion. You are in an underground shelter. The ventilation will stop in 20 minutes... and then you'll all die. There is absolutely no chance... of escape. I don't know when you got back. There's only 20 minutes left... What? Norhow the exam went. - No results yet. Shush! - But how did you feel? Well? Fine. Quite well. Concentrate. We came here to do this exercise. I want you to think about how you feel... and how to use these last twenty minutes. I can smell smoke. Maybe from your clothes. - People smoke, Leo! - I don't know how you can. I'll let you know when time's up. Relax. Let's connect, okay? Yeah. Am I done now? Yes, me too. So we leave together. Yes. Do you want a lift? Well? I've never cheated on my wife. Incredible, isn't it? After so many years. I'm going to shower. UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AIRES DEPARTMENT OF ODONTOLOGY Are you okay? - Are you okay? - What? Are you all right? Tell me. What should I say? No, nothing, nothing. Better if we speak another time. Martha! MY WOMEN HAD A NAME I hope you pardon me for singing to you... in a language that is foreign to you. But it is my mother's tongue. It is for you. Martha's song. Martha, your name lingers on. You are my future. I lose myself in your skin, like Hansel, like Gretel. But I'll find my way again, leading me to your breasts. Your lips, your softness, your freckles... Martha, you are my bliss. I have no fear at your side. That's how it is. That's how it is, without you I am nothing. That's how it is, that's how it is, my beautiful Martha. That's how it is, that's how it is, without you I am nothing. That's how it is, that's how it is, my beautiful Martha. All together! Vindel, Leonardo? Yes. CONGRATULATIONS! Martha! - They remembered? - It looks as if they did. I can't believe they remembered our anniversary. - Yes. - Aren't they sweet? - Lovely. - Let's see. Try it on. - No, no, no. - Let me see. No, it's bad luck, it's like birthdays. - You can't celebrate before the day. - How is it bad luck? Seriously! Put them away now. In my bedside cabinet, first drawer. What? Tell me now. No, no... Come on, tell me... lanib? Leonardo! Come here! Come here! Lanib! He won a big prize for his book! It's a publishing deal. They want to print it in seven languages! Can you say hello? Julia is so happy. They even offered him a movie deal. Can you imagine that? Great. Do you know who I am? They treat me worse than anobody. Purpose of your trip? Can I use that phone? My son-in-law is in politics. He'll sort it out. He's a very well-known Israeli artist, a Mossad agent. Yanif's his name, lanib. Martha... What's the phonetic spelling of lanib's surname? Did somebody give you a parcel? I'm also a well-known artist, back home and abroad. Have you got Google? Search for my name, you'll get a shock. Hello... I know the Rikudim. Shall I show you? Every hour, every kiss, every memory we set on fire, maybe sometime... will keep us warm. Each tear, every drop of sweat... that time evaporated... will blow... the steam whistle. And beyond... our visual field... we'll have been the fire... and the fuel. A nice edition. - Very nice, really. - Thank you. Very nice. Martha! - Thank you. - Very nice, really. - So that must bet he front cover. - Of course. - For us it'd be the back cover. - It's in Hebrew. - Yes, that's why... - Sure, sure. - Shall we set the table? - Yes. - Notice the paper? - Yes. What is it? It's wonderful. Look how they're getting on. I'm not sure about the photo cover. Well, it's the content that matters. I was airing my concerns, because we're talking... about an irreversible decision. You can't remove it. Like a tattoo... It won't hurt to get a second opinion. We already know your opinion. If there is a circumcision, we'll discuss it. Can we change the subject? I'm not ready to be a grandmother. I am, just so you know. Dad, tell us what you're writing. If you won't, we'll ask Martha. Julia told me that she's... the first to hear his ideas. That he only carries on with the story... if he gets your attention. He hasn't told me anything in a while. So if he won't tell you... I need to go to the bathroom. It's inside, right? Yes, inside. Over there. What's up with him? Don't worry. - What did you say? - Dad's not drinking wine. He'll drink. - Now they've got a rug, Martha. - What rug? One like ours, from Salta. Remember it? The one in the dining room. Do you remember how the kids always played on it? I do, like it was yesterday. The three of them always on the rug. Incredible. They threw their toys on it. It was a mystery to me, why they always stayed there. So one day I moved it. I put it in the hallway. And they moved there, too, to play on the rug. Amazing, like a magic carpet. A magnet. They didn't need anything else. Leonardo, the kids always played barefoot at home. We had floor heating! Remember? We've heard it a million times. The rug came later. We brought it back from Salta, - but they were older then. - Yes! Must have imagined it. Maybe I was in a different family. Whether it's a real memory or a fantasy, it's a lovely story. Why argue about it? Family stories, they're always true. Look! They took it apart piece by piece!
