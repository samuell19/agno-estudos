This is Paris, at the end of winter. It is just after midnight. I really hate this new habit people have of serving 5 or 6 wines for dinner, Like tonight: Two white wines, two red wines, sparkling wine, which I hate. a mediocre Bordeaux, And all that is served with just any kind of food. What a waste! Don't you think, Madam? I don't know, Maybe, I know nothing about it. Pull over at the phone booth. Why is your friend calling from a public phone? Doesn't his phone work? Could you spare some change, please? Here you are. Thank you. Or doesn't he have a phone? What time is it? I'm tired, I'm going home. Good night, Serge. I will be at the hunting club on Saturday morning. Come round Monday or Tuesday. I will be at the hunting club on Saturday morning. Come round Monday or Tuesday. I'll try. No, you must come. You must bring the device. Fine. You still have time to think about the rest. - I'll call you. - Alright. Hey, the café we used to go to after the theatre's still open. Sit in the front seat. No, please, stop off at a chemist's. What was the name of my character in that play? Clélie? Clélia? It was such a long time ago, Lélia, That's right, Lélia. Lélia, I remember. I'd like some Vériane, please. I have these new sleeping tablets, - The American stuff? - Yes. I hear it's very effective. Fine, I will try it. Thank you. Good night, I can feel a draught. How come? Here. - Who was that guy you spoke to? - What guy? After dinner. I don't know. He's very nice. You behaved like a tart and you don't know who he is? Don't be silly, I saw you, You kept touching his arm. You rested your head on his shoulder. Everyone was looking. I'm glad they were. They were all bored. And you were plotting on the balcony. I could hear you laughing. You were too loud. I don't like your friend. He's old. He scares me. He's evil. I don't like women who behave badly. Where is it coming from? And you've been drinking! Have you been drinking? I have. What did you drink? I don't know. Champagne. A lot of it? Yes, a lot of it. - How come? - I don't know. I don't know, I don't care. Clement, at last, here you are! Where have you been? At a dinner party. Who is it? My father. I called the factory around seven but you had already left. How is it going? Not very well. They were demonstrating and throwing stones out front all afternoon, What are you going to do? There's a board meeting tomorrow. You must come! It won't solve anything! They can't be on strike for two weeks. Give them what they want. I can speak to them, can't I? What are you hoping for? Think you can get out of it by giving them a tiny pay rise? Don't start again! Please! French employers, really! I'll be there when they die. French employers don't need you or your friends of far. Anyway, I don't want to hear your opinions. When the police arrest you, we can say goodbye to the government's goods orders. - What's that music? - Nothing. - Your wife? - Yes. It's nothing. What time at the factory? 9 o'clock. I'll be there. Good night. Good night, Clément. I'm a bitch, a bitch! I love you, Anne. I love you. That's awful! My eyes are just so red. Your husband won't be home for lunch. - Did you watch the telly last night? - No. You really missed something. It was charming: La Grande Duchesse by Offenbach, God knows I know this opera! I even sang it. But last night, it was just lovely. What a choir, what voices, what an orchestra! That young one was in it, you know. What's her name again? I can't remember her name. - God, it's heavy, - What is it? I don't know, I've just found it in the cupboard, - Just now? - Yes, Here, now. I don't know what it is. Don't know! Her name is... I can never remember anything. Anyway, her singing was just divine. - Morning, Father. Am I late? - No, you're first. - When did you find it? - This morning. - Did Marthe see it? - No. What is it, Clément? Tell me. A bazooka. A war weapon. To shoot and destroy tanks. What's it doing here? Why are you hiding it? What will you do with it? Is it yours? Are you going to keep it? I won't keep it here, I'll take it away soon. Clément, I don't like this. You're scaring me. I don't like it when you're brutal and odd. I don't like that man from last night. And I wish I hadn't found this today. I don't like it, you're scaring me. I met with my father and my brothers this morning. I hurled insults at them. I'm leaving the factory. I won't see them anymore. How about your job? No more family, work or money. Now I'm a free man. Come over here, It is exactly 10:37 pm. That Sunday night, Clément finally realised that Anne was bored. To please her, he agreed to take her to one of these nightclubs he hated. - Good evening, How are you? - Fine, thanks. - My husband. - Pleased to meet you. We haven't seen you in a while. - What are you doing here? - You haven't changed. - You're still so beautiful. - Oh no, I've aged, can't you see? I can't see anything. It's great to see you here. - Are you still in the theatre? - No, I don't act anymore. - What became of you? - I got married. Come for a dance. - You were leaving. - Who is this? An old friend of mine. What do you think you're doing? - Always behaving like a slut. - Let go of me. Like a slut! You brute! I've had it. That's not very nice. Come outside. Come out! Take it easy. - Speak French, this is France. - I don't understand. Anne? Hold on. Serge, your Paris number. Serge speaking. Speak up, I can't hear you. Clément? Oh, yes, Clément speaking. Oh, Serge, Where are you, Serge? Oh, you're there. Are you drunk? I'm asking you if you're drunk. No, I'm not. I took some sleeping tablets. I'm not used to them. Yes, I can hear you. I'll be waiting for you. You must come. Sure, I made up my mind. You know, Anne left me. Anne, my wife. She left three days ago. She won't come back. I'm not going to stay in here waiting. I've had it, It won't stop raining. It's driving me mad, you see. I'll wait for you, Clément was part of an extremist political group with 12 members. Serge had been chosen as a leader and instructor. They met twice a month for a training session. To the outside world, they were part of a hunting club. During the day, they practised, in the evenings, they worked on theory. Themes Serge developed were as follows: The Western World is declining. Power must be seized to be regenerated. And communism must be defeated. That night, Serge and Clément did not leave with the rest of them. They stayed at the hunting club. They were working on a plan with political implications: An operation to be carried out with extreme care. There's our friend, Terrasse. We're too close. He'll be suspicious. No, we're not. - Move over to his left. - Why? Would you have a light, please? Tonight, 10,30. It will be fine. Last Monday, further to the demonstration organised by trade unions and various political groups, counter-demonstrators sparked off fierce riots. Many people were injured and taken to nearby chemists. Among them was Louis Terrasse, MP for Paris, who had spoken during the demonstration. For the first time in Europe, in Hamburg, a female elephant gave birth to a beautiful baby. Why did you choose to come back today? Today of all days. This wasn't the first time Serge was to commit a political murder. The first time had been in Canton in 1927. After that, there had been Saigon, Casablanca, Zürich and Frankfurt. Serge was looking at Clément. For it was Clément's first time. I've been waiting for you. Leave me alone, I took a sleeping tablet. ASSASSINATION IN PARIS THE BODY OF LOUIS TERRASSE, MP FOR PARIS, VANISHES IN THE EXPLOSION This winter, I could change the curtains in the bedroom. And I will get new wallpaper for the hallway, - What colour? - Grey or beige. - Or tobacco brown, what do you think? - I have no idea. Hold on, I'll put you through. - Who is it? - I think it's your friend, Serge, It can't be. Who's calling? It's me, Clément. You have to leave Paris today. Why is that? Because I think we've been betrayed. Go hide anywhere for three weeks. Lucien will act as a go-between. This can't be! Who else knew? Nobody knew, I don't know, I was told this morning. Where are you now? At a friend's. No, I can't say anything. Goodbye, Clément. Leave at once. We're just being careful, that's all. They might not even be looking for me! It's an old political story. Take me with you. It's best not to. Take me with you. You'll need me, I will help you. Please take me with you. It's around here but we're on the wrong road. - Does he live here all year round? - Yes, He likes the country. I can see a bridge. - Where? - Down there. A suspension bridge. I came here once on summer holiday four or five years ago. And since then? When I left for Algeria, we exchanged a few letters and then we lost touch. You can stay as long as you like, do as you please. You can have guests. There are two other rooms upstairs. Whose bedroom is this one then? It's more or less mine. No, Paul. No way. I have a bed in the living room. I'll be fine. The sun comes in the morning, it doesn't here. There are a few books here but there are more things next door. Here, I need to inform you about the one unconditional rule: Meals are at 12,30 and 7,30. If you're ever late, you're in trouble. My housekeeper never forgives anyone. ...for his fiancée Jacqueline, 8 rue Pasteur in Courbevoie. in a small town in Auvergne. In an institute. A secondary school run by missionaries, well, priests really. During the Occupation, this region was unoccupied. In the morning, we'd run up the colours and we'd sing: "Marshal, here we come." - How old were you? - 12. - How about you? - 10. I was doing pretty badly at school but Clément was quite good. Look. There is still a mark. Me too! What is it? We cut ourselves with a pencil sharpener. - Deliberately? - Of course. - Why? - The blood pact, For life and beyond the grave. My goodness! She's so funny! In the village, they all worry I'll grab her, like Bluebeard. Poor Cécile! This is "Europe Soir" with Pierre Andro. We were to start this bulletin with the Geneva Conference, but we have a last minute exclusive: A man we believed to have died in an assassination attempt last night, Louis Terrasse, MP for Paris, is here in our studio. He has just come in, he is going to speak to you. Cécile, don't change the station. Blast! ...where you were during the explosion. - At a friends' place. - Louder, We have several questions. Where were you? Who was in the flat? You are here to tell us. Please go ahead. It started with a phone call I received a month ago. "Sir, he said, I am a member of a revolutionary group who wants you dead. " "I was told to kill you." "But I decided to save your life." I replied: "Good!" And I hung up. I thought he was mad. Many people call to threaten me, I'm not scared anymore. The day after, he called again. He said the same thing. He says he's risking his life too. His voice sounded so sincere and convincing that I thought I would listen to what he had to say. The assassination attempt would be in the next 3 weeks. Was he giving details? He refused to give details. He kept saying: "You're going to die." "If you want to survive, follow my instructions. " What were those instructions? "First: Carry on working at your place as you normally do. " "Second: I will call you one hour prior to the assassination attempt. " "Third: Buy yourself a dummy of your size and build. " A dummy? I must say I nearly burst out laughing when I heard that. I thought it was a joke again. I thought it over and two days later, I went to buy the dummy myself. I couldn't help but wait for his call each night and I had a tape recorder ready to record the conversation. I didn't have any news for two weeks. I stopped thinking about it, when one night, last night, I got a phone call from him as promised. And now you'll be listening to the recording, a world exclusive on our station. It's incredible! It sounds like a joke. - Mr Terrasse? - Speaking. The assassination attempt will be in an hour. Do you have the dummy? - Yes. - Serge, Put it in front of your desk as you would normally sit. Draw the curtains. Leave the light on. Leave the flat at once. What if I won't believe you? You'll be dead in an hour's time. You really want to save my life? - Yes. - Why? It's none of your business. Do as I said. Goodbye. Listen to me. 20 minutes later, you were at a friend's place and this morning, you read about your assassination in the papers. That's right. Thank you for coming tonight. This is no news in brief. I came here to tell French people... that murderers are amongst us, ready for violence. Well, now... ready to smother our fundamental rights... And now, a commercial break. He's taking advantage of the situation. I think he's right. His story is extraordinary. Clément, would you like a cigar? No, thanks, Do you mind if I go up to my room? Right now? Yes, indeed, I'm very tired. As you wish, Anne, will you stay then? Yes, but not long, - Good night. - See you tomorrow. Do you like apple brandy? Cécile's father makes it. - No, thanks. - Would you like a coffee? No, thanks. Lime tea? Verbena? Mint tea? Jasmine tea? Hot toddy? We don't have any of those, sir. We don't? So you'll have to put up with me drinking on my own then. So you, you print books? Yes, I do, That's a nice job. Indeed. I'm sorry, I'm going to go upstairs too. Sure, good night. He didn't give me away. He wouldn't, I know that. I will find him, Serge, He'll have to explain this to me. He's the one who shot, right? No, he's not. You did? - We have to leave. - Not tonight, definitely not tonight. Everything he told me was a lie. And I believed everything he said. Why did he do that to me? I could cook veal for lunch tomorrow. Good idea. - You'll have to go buy the meat. - I'll go. - And for dinner? - We'll see. I need to know. Well, say, a mushroom omelette. O-me-le-tte. Morning, everyone. - How are you? - I've come for my leaflets. They're over there. I did one sentence in bold, you know, the one about the union unity. Good idea, Alright, I'm off. I'll try to hand them out at the workshops. Thanks. See you soon, Paul. You're an early riser at least. We're leaving. - Are you kidding? - No, we're not. You haven't even had breakfast! We must go back to Paris. I feel sorry, Don't you like the windmill? We'll be back, you know. I hope so, If not, I won't speak to you anymore, Well, yes, he betrayed me. Why do you speak to me in that tone? Take me to Saint-Cloud, Then go to the flat. You know nothing, you never saw me again. Here comes Mr Clément's car. - Follow that car, - Yes, sir. CAR PARK LAW COURTS - Did the police bother you much? - No, they didn't. Did they want to know where Clément is? Indeed. - You don't know where he is? - I don't. - Absolutely not, - No, Fine. But when you see him. tell him he must go and see the magistrate now. Thank God, he did not kill anyone! The trial won't take long. The sentence won't be either. I am sure it won't be, I have been told so. If I see him, I will tell him. The afternoon of that same day, the group met for an extraordinary session. After a mock trial, two options were put to the vote. Is Serge guilty? Does Serge deserve to die? Clément spoke, and offered to be solely responsible for the execution. He was granted that right. You don't need three weeks to phone all around Spain. If Serge is in Madrid, he can be traced in two days. Let me handle it. - As soon as. - I'll come and get you. In the meantime, just stay at the mill. - You'd better hurry, Lucien, - OK, bye! I was pretending not to listen to him but I think your father was right. There's nothing to be worried about, The longer you wait. Never! Do you hear me? I need my freedom in order to find Serge, Even if it takes a lifetime. And when you find him? I will kill him, And then? What about us? What will become of us? This can't be, It can, But I don't want this. I don't want this any longer. I wanted to live, you see? And you destroy me, A little bit more every day. You'll end up killing me too. What's wrong with you? You are mad! Mad! - Good evening, - Is Clément with you? - Yes, We wanted to. - Where is he? Over there. - You wanted to kill that man, Terrasse? - Yes. Why? Answer me. Because he had to die. You're going to leave, right? You will leave never to come back. - Listen. - No, I won't listen. I don't want to see you here anymore, that's final. Someone will pick me up tonight or tomorrow. Not tonight or tomorrow, Right now, And you're the one telling me this? Yes, indeed. Because I can't stand people like you lot. You disgust me, You might think you'll bring us to heel, but you'll never get us, I don't want violence, But if you look for it, I will retaliate. I'll take this spanner and smash your head in. So you are a, what's the word again, a democrat. Leave me alone, will you? I'm asking you to leave, it's simple enough. Very simple. You want me to get arrested. If I leave now, it's very likely. Shut up! Go for it. Go on, give me up! Get out of here! When will they come? Tonight or tomorrow, Fine, you have 24 hours. Isn't Paul coming? He said he's not coming, He's working, - You won't be drinking wine? - No, thank you, - God, you were hard to find! - So? Serge is in Cadiz, He's leaving on a boat the day after tomorrow, - Where to? - They don't know, OK, wait for me, Hurry up, See? I'm leaving, Good, Lucien is here, I'm leaving, Take me with you, I can't, Then I won't let you go, Anne, you have to be brave and wait for me, You won't get out of here, If you leave me alone, I'm finished, Don't say that, please! I can't live without you, I have no life, you know it! Please stay, Don't leave me alone, Go, Go wherever you want, Go away, You will never find me again, Never! I will be dead or I will have disappeared, Go back inside, You'll catch a cold, A few hours after Clément left, Anne fell seriously ill. She was delirious for days. It was only with Cécile's devotion that she managed to get better. That's very kind, Thank you, - I'm not disturbing you, am I? - No, please come in, Are you sure you should go out? I'm much better, You haven't met my apprentices, This is Michel, the one with the moustache, And this is Leon, who's very smart, And this is Claude, our latest recruit, I got a letter, The first envelope was for me, and the second one is for you, Come on, get to work, You too! My love, I hope you will receive this letter. I am in Buenos Aires. I don't know how long I will have to stay here. I would like you to know... The boat trip nearly went wrong. Luckily, a pleasure boat going down the river came to rescue the victims. Thanks for stopping, Your sister? The owner and his wife were sailing to Le Havre whilst listening to Mozart. - We're not disturbing you, are we? - Not at all, They invited Anne and Cécile for a drink and then for dinner. The party went on quite late into the night. I'll send you the boat back on the 9th. He's going to be mad, you'll see. Congrats, well done! Enjoying life! Our boat was wrecked and then we, we drank champagne. We, we, Some millionaire guy wooed us, he's mad about us. What else? You haven't had your dinner then. I found apples and jam. See, he can manage on his own. And I was worried about him! - You'd be stupid to be. - That's true. She's totally drunk! What's that about? Go to bed at once. Off to bed! What would your father say if he saw you like that? He'd understand. He's a home distiller. Please! - Good night, Anne. - Good night, Cécile. She's started smoking. She's doing her hair all day, And now she's a party girl. - That's terrible! - I'm not joking. No, not enough. Alright, then. You know you represent the ideal woman for her, like in her books. I like Cécile. But I understand, I'm being accused of having a bad influence on her. - Not at all. - Yes and I'll go then. - I'm going to leave. - You must rest. No, I'm fine now, I have recovered. I can tell I'm boring you. And Mr Dassonville, the millionaire who adores me will lend me his boat to go to Paris. A boat just for me! A yacht! What's more, I have to go back to Paris. I must go back to Paris. What will you do in Paris? I don't know, I don't know. Nothing, really. There is one thing I would like to know. Why did you stop acting? Because I wasn't good enough. And because Clément wanted me to stop and also because of my accent. But you enjoyed acting? Yes, I enjoyed it. I was frightened. I knew I wasn't very good. but I enjoyed it. Why not start again? - What? Now? - Yes, I'm too old and I couldn't now. You'd need to practise. Practise? I lost the hang of it. And what would I rehearse? Who with? Where? I don't have the will anymore. I'll be back. Where are you going? To the attic. - Your mysterious bedroom? - There's nothing mysterious about it. The room gets the sun and I feel good in it. It's a play I would like you to read. I have read it. I happened to go up to that room. I saw the notebook, I shouldn't have but what I read moved me. My wife wrote this play a few months before she died. Cécile told me, Your wife had very black eyes. She didn't speak much. Since you know everything. Please keep it. It's for you. - You're giving it to me? - Yes. Because I think you should be in that play. - But I couldn't, - I'm sure you could. You think so? Why give me such a present? You don't know me. When you don't know people, you can't give them presents. I don't need anything. I need to be left alone. I won't do this, I wouldn't be able to. I am not an actress, I'm nothing. Leave me alone. What's with me? Why stare at me? You want to be nice to me. I don't need your kindness. I don't want this play, I don't want your presents. Leave me alone, will you? - What? - Come here. There's a lock, If you want to go grocery shopping. I'm too lazy for that, I'm happy with the tins. Sure. I bet you hate them. I'll go shopping then. If I may, get some salad and vegetables. Fine. At the same time, 7000 miles away from there, in a South American city... After 3 happy days going up the Seine, Anne and Paul arrived in Paris one morning. The weather was dull but it did not matter much. They decided to stay at the Hôtel de Suéde in a room overlooking the banks of the river. A week later, Paul was happy to meet with Métivier, a printer with whom he had started his career as a typographer. Métivier lent him a machine for him to carry on with his work. The papers published articles regarding Serge's death. They said Serge had been bribed by a financial group who were rivals of Clément's father. According to them, Serge had received a large sum to implicate Clément in a mock assassination. Along with the son, they were aiming at the father. Serge, who was weary of his failed revolutionary life, had become a traitor because of financial issues. As for Clément, the Argentinian police was actively looking for him. After much work, Paul finally met a director who agreed to stage his play. Scared to death and full of hope, Anne agreed to play the part and the rehearsals began. I won't manage. I'll never get anywhere! Two months went by and one night... - I'm late, aren't I? - No, - Have you been waiting long? - No, There's all you need in this car. "Hirelux", what does that mean? It means hire of luxury cars. This car is much too big for us. I wanted it to be comfortable, It's a long drive. Switch off the fan. I like Robowski, He's a good director but, he gets on our nerves. He explains everything with psychoanalysis, it takes hours. After all that, we don't know where we stand. We're wasting time, the dress rehearsal is in 2 weeks. Where are we? In Dôle. And it's not funny. I need to stop for a coffee or I might fall asleep. What time is it? Six o'clock. - How far are we from Geneva? - It's 26 miles away. Good. I remember I once went to Geneva, just after the war. It was a dreamlike city. It didn't look real. There were so many things in the shops. My father and I would run from one shop window to another like mad. Right. - We ate chocolate all day long. - Right. - It's not interesting, is it? - No. What's with you? What have I done to you? You haven't said a word since last night, you're like. We mustn't think about it, I'm not scared, you know. It's straight forward. It's a minor operation, It's not even an operation. I know. We can't do otherwise. It can't be, you understand? It's best not to think about it. Everything will be fine and we'll go back to Paris. Everything will be just the same again. Tell me I'm right. Tell me I need to do it. Paul, tell me, I'm doing the right thing, aren't I? Be quiet, please! You're right. Shall we go back? Yes, let's go back. You know why I'm keeping the baby? To give him to you. You gave me everything and I never gave you anything. We'll be quits. I'm leaving my bicycle here, Please keep an eye on it. I don't mind but this is no place to leave a bike. - So you're going to Paris? - Yes. You must be happy. You've never been. What's it to you if I've ever been or not? Just as bad-tempered as your dad! Where did you come from? Clément. Last night, he got there and knocked at the door. I was scared, I didn't want to let him in. I cooked for him and he was asking me questions. He said... He is looking for you. I said: "She'll be back tomorrow," And at lunchtime, as he was sleeping, I left. You have to go back, I'll go with you. Tomorrow morning. - No, right now, - I can't tonight, What am I going to do? I'll find you a room, There is a hotel on the square and a restaurant too, Tonight, go and see a film, Then go to bed and I'll come and get you in the morning, Call for you, Thanks, Are you alright? Not too nervous? I'm OK, We had another rehearsal earlier on, All I have to do is wait, I felt like talking to you, I'm going to come, You wouldn't come when we rehearsed but tonight if you don't come, I will never find the strength to go on stage, I need you, Paul, I need you, You are a part of me now, I know it, I know it, I love you, Anne, I will come, You mustn't be frightened, Everything will be fine, Do you think so? Goodbye, My God! The play we had the pleasure of rehearsing tonight for the last time before you was written by Dominique Laforêt, Look, he's walking around the island, Promise you'll never tell Paul, Yes, sure, See, I came back, I can't travel like everyone else so it took me a long time but I'm here, Clément, I must tell you, Yes, Anne? I came to say I was leaving you, I understand, You may be right, It was strange, I would reach a city where I didn't know a soul, And yet, someone would take care of me, They would give me money and find me a passport, And I would never see them again, Later, the same thing would happen in another town, Strangers would help me, hide me, Same, everywhere, You didn't like it when I drank wine, I also wanted to tell you: In Parana, in Argentina, I lived in an attic for a week, with some German refugees, There was a hatch and a ladder, You can have coffee if you like, No, thanks, It was very good, Cécile, - Is Cécile your friend? - Yes, she is, You look a bit like sisters now, I have to leave, No, you don't, I must be at the theatre at seven, Theatre! Forget about your theatre for a minute, I don't want to forget about it, You have to stay with me, I've just got here from the other side of the world, I can't, Please, Why are you trying to charm me? Why have you been trying to seduce me? Because you're gorgeous, Because I thought about you, every day and every night, Leave me alone, I don't love you, It's over, You've lost me, I don't belong to you now, I have a life now, you can't come back to hurt me, I live with Paul, I love Paul, I am expecting his child, Sorry, I must have made a mistake, - Are you Paul? - Yes, You didn't make a mistake, He's waiting for you upstairs, I received your letter, I came here because I wanted to speak to you too, Really? How long have you been in France? It doesn't matter, - So you know? - I do, I want you to understand properly, - Listen to me, - I won't, No speech, no explanation, What has been sealed with blood will be unsealed with blood, There was a pact between us, And you did not respect the pact, We have to fight, Fight a duel, How old are you? 12? Here are two pistols, P 38s, German pistols, I chose them because they kill and because I never used one before, I need a month to practise and you do too, We will practise and the duel will take place in a month, - That's all you had to say? - No, One more thing, Anne must not know anything about it, As for me, I am just hoping for one thing: To kill you, I hope with all my heart to kill you, Right, Goodbye, Here's yours, Here's mine, Not for me, Don't count me in, You won't fight? Not with you or anybody, I'm not interested, Put them away, Are you scared? Bye, Paul, I'm in a hurry, Please lock up, Sure, good night! Here he comes, So still refusing then? Yes! And now? WILL WAIT AT VAL 3010 I like this necklace, Fifty-one pearls, You gave it to me the day I moved into your house, Enough, now, Let's go, I will always keep it with me, Why are you standing by the window? He won't be back until midnight, Look, You've seen the play 5 times, Let's not see it all again, She's never been as good as she is tonight, Come on, we have to go, Wait a bit longer, Come on now! Come on! Come on! - Won't you leave me alone? - Shut up, Why should I shut up? Here, Put it on, Put it on, Do you want people to recognise you? I am getting tired of you, I'm tired of hiding you, feeding you, watching you, I'm going to take you to Bordeaux, I won't leave you till you're on a boat, And then we can breathe again, With your behaviour, we will all end up in jail, There's only three of us left, you idiot, Please turn off the light, What's wrong with you? What is it? I'm not feeling well, What happened? Tell me, I have had some trouble, Does it hurt? I don't know, It's all in the past, "Waiter, brandy, please!" "You have blood all over your face, sir," "Whatever, Waiter, give us two brandies," Lie down, I was walking down the street, Some side street, A street like any other, actually, There was a group of guys on the pavement who wouldn't let me go, I pushed one as I went past, That's what they wanted, They went for me, Just for fun, I got slaughtered, I am not a pretty sight, am I? You will find me ugly and you will stop loving me, My love! On a secondary road towards Bordeaux. Mrs Lesser? She's gone, - She's not here? - No, she's gone, Are you kidding me? I'm telling you she's gone, - What room was she in? - Room 12, I'm going to check, - You're not cold? - No, I'm fine, Do we have tea? There is nothing in this house, Tomorrow, I'll go to the village, I'll go, I'll go with you then, We'll store up for winter, And then we can stay in, In January, there is so much snow that you can't get out, You'll see! One year, the river was frozen up to the locks, I like winter, So do I, Come to the island, I'm waiting for you, I am going to the southern tip, Go to the northern tip, When you're ready, shoot in the air and we'll walk towards each other,
