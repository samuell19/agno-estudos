All I wanted, all I ever wanted was for my husband to love me. That wasn't meant to be because that's not how we've made the world. No, that isn't... No, he promised... Yeah, typical. Yeah. - Everything okay? - I'm late. Oh, a guy from the insurance company is gonna come by today with some papers for you to cosign. Oh, we don't already have insurance? Of course, but Ron wants us to update our policy. Sent a emissary by the office the other day, new kid, had all the ladies swooning. Sounds like you'll love him. What does that mean? He's good-looking, that's all. Ooh, I got us a tri-tip for dinner. Oh, my favorite. But I'm supposed to meet Councilman Peck tonight. - Oh. - I'll call you. I love you, Ste. Why'd you say that? 'Cause I love you? If you get yourself knocked up, that's all gonna change. Yeah, I... I appreciate what you're saying, Mama, but it's... it's not as easy as that, okay? Can we just... can we just talk about something else? Uh, there's a new dollar machine down at the casino. If you win a free spin, the horses run. Okay. Okay, Mama. Mama, I... I got to hang up now. I... I got to go. I love you too. Mrs. Stevens? Jake Walters, Vertex Insurance. If you prefer, I can come back later, or you could go up and change. No, uh, oh, this is only gonna take a minute, right? Right. Would you mind if... Could I have a glass of water? Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah. - Ah, thank you. - Sure. So what do we do here? Since the insurance is held in your trust, you need to cosign. - What kind of insurance? - Life. It's been increased to $15 million. - For my husband? - For both of you. Stunning view. Can we? If anything happened to him, he wanted you to be provided for, and God forbid, well, he asked me not to say this, but if anything happened to you, it would destroy him. He wouldn't be able to work. - He said that? - Mm. How sweet of him. So where do I sign? Uh, well, actually, there's a bit more to it than just that. You need to check your medical history here. Oh. Okay. So, uh, why is the insurance in our trust? I don't know. It's what rich people do. They're either flashing it or hiding it. Some lifestyles are expensive, not that I would know. Both: Oh. Your name is Sue Anne but people call you Brooke? - Long, boring story. - I'd love to hear it. May I say this? You have a very compelling quality. Do I? This is a... This is a very unusual insurance meeting. Yes. May I ask another question? I don't see how to stop you at this point. Does your husband know? That you're not completely happy? Ah, right. Mm. Um, why... why would I answer that? Even... even if that were... The next step, you and your husband will need to get physicals, and I'll generate the final docs. Uh, and then you'll have to come back for me to sign the papers? No, no need to bother you again. We can do it all electronically. I see it a lot. Couples, they start taking each other for granted, and obviously you're a very gorgeous woman, but sometimes people stop communicating in an intimate way, you know, talking and so on. I don't know you. That's right. You shouldn't be talking to me like this. You're right. I shouldn't. It's perfectly safe. We'll never see each other again, and I find, don't you, it's much easier talking to a stranger? What you're selling, the insurance, what does it do? Nothing. Nothing can ward off despair, but insurance does provide financial and emotional protection against the unthinkable. Of course, once you've thought it, it's not unthinkable anymore. - Good morning, Mrs. Stevens. - Oh, good morning, Carlita. - Pleasure meeting you. - Pleasure meeting you too. You're a remarkable person, Brooke. You need to accept that and decide what you want from your life. Wow, that was so cool. Let's ride it again! No, no, we're going to the arcade. - Yay! - Yay. Oh, Jessie is so cute. She's making your ovaries hurt, isn't she? That obvious? We've... we've stopped trying for now, I guess. Stopped trying to get pregnant or stopped screwing? Well, one does cause the other. Oh, it's nothing a good BJ can't fix. That's Tara's solution to everything. Yeah, I'm sure the night you conceived started with one of those. No, that night started off with one too many martinis. Sexy underwear, communication, and BJs are the key to a happy marriage. Not in that order. Okay, I'm gonna start with the sexy underwear. You need to find a young man to get the job done. I could never do that to him. Sparking life back into unused parts is the best thing you can do for a marriage. And Tara knows what she's talking about. Mm-hmm. That's right, I totally forgot about that night with your Italian model. Nights, plural, and I regretted it. Oh, you did not. You spoke about those orgasms for weeks. Maybe we should all get divorced, pool our money, and run off to Capri. Mm-mm, that would not be fair to you guys. I'd get zip in a divorce. - You signed a prenup? - I didn't have to. Ste doesn't actually own anything. It's all tied up in his family's trust. I thought you were rich. Thank God I don't have to envy you anymore. Money makes everything so much more complicated. Being poor sucks. Well, I could certainly use a little less complication in my life. This is the weirdest upsell I've ever seen. I offered to buy you a drink, and you want to sell me insurance? Bad things happen. You got to protect your kid. How do you even know if I have a kid? I read people. Oh, that's bullshit. All right, I'll prove it. You were married, young, to a woman, one kid. Lasted a few years, she had no idea your wandering eye was for the mechanic that serviced your car. Two old-fashioneds, please. What... what are you, clairvoyant? Your dad, he died before you came out, didn't he? And you came out, what, like, three, four years ago? You been talking to my ex-wife? Just give me a sec. Ah. You know, you're cruel. Effective and profitable. That's what credit cards are for. I'm sorry. You hit a nerve. You had my dad pegged, all right. I was an idiot not to tell him who I am. He loved you. Parents always know. Ah, um, when you, uh, get serious about insurance... Want to get out of here? Hey. There's another three policies. Oh, you're amazing. These guys, they have art collections. They have wine collections, real estate holdings. They're supporting elderly parents. Someone needs to be protecting their interests. And they want to hook up. Wong, who knew you were so small-minded? Since these guys got the shaft from the insurance industry during the '80s, they trust us just about as far as they can throw us. I'm just non-judgmental. I remind them that they share the same risks as everyone else. Just not sure that your father would approve of your methods. Let's just say dad was old-school. I'm more reform school. Okay, well, be careful. There's a fine line. Remember, you are not invincible. Oh, my God, I'm not? Mrs. Stevens. Oh, hi. - Wow. - What are you doing here? Nice to see you again. You look... Good thing I bumped into you 'cause, uh, I have your policy, and I was gonna, like I said, email it to you, but I'm old school. With a big policy like this I prefer getting a real check, real papers. Would you mind if I dropped by again or... - Yeah, sure. - Excellent. Then it's a date... uh, an appointment. Hey. Hate to do this to you. What? Last-minute trip with some buyers to New Orleans. It's a backup plan if the rezoning falls through. I'll be back tomorrow night. I made you snickerdoodles. You want one? And add an extra hour onto the treadmill? Yeah, no thanks. I don't know if it'd be fun hanging out on Bourbon Street, but you don't want to go? Uh, yeah, I would... I'd love to, but, uh, real estate exam's coming up. Yeah. - I should study. - Yup, no, that's good. Oh, don't forget we have that charity thing on Sunday. I won't. Councilman Peck is supposed to be there. I want you to look great. I'm gonna go pack. "Oh, no, no, thank you, sweetheart. "It... it was so nice of you to bake them for me though." Hi. Hey. Wow, you look stunning. Thank you. Well, the truth is you don't have to wear anything. Anything special, I mean. You're always breathtaking. I mean, literally, when I look at you I forget to breathe. You're smooth. We're drinking? We're celebrating. Veuve Clicquot? Kind of a hip place for an insurance meeting, no? Yeah, I lied. I thought it would be more adventuresome to meet here. We work so hard, don't we? To be in control. To do what we're supposed to do. But we can't, and we're not. How would you feel if Stevens died? I'm... I'm sorry. What? It's a natural question with life insurance. Most married folks have a wish disguised as a fear. Their spouse is in a car accident or has a heart attack or something like that. Yeah, Ste's death would... would be a disaster. My... my life would be over. No. This life would be over, but yours would start again. Things happen, Brooke. Things that we don't anticipate, and if we're alive, if we're still alive, then we have to be open to those things. I think that there's someone else in there. In you. Someone that you don't let out very often. Someone who's a little dangerous, someone who wants very much to be alive. That's why I had to see you again. In fact, I... I can't remember when I wanted something quite so much. I've rented a room. - I lo... I love my husband. - Of course you do. When we were first married, we would go... We'd go on getaway weekends, and we'd go hiking together, and he was so doting... - Do you want to go upstairs? - I can't. I... you should not... you should not be asking me that. That's not what I asked you. Have you seen my iPad? Uh, check my nightstand. Carlita. Oh. Pepper spray? What's this? For protection. From me? No. What's-her-name, purple slacks, three doors down, intruder broke in, tried to rape her daughter. Well, if you're that concerned, I'll get you a gun. I'll sleep on it. You know, you said something the other night in your sleep. - I was dreaming? - Maybe. You said, "Of course I love you, but I also hate your guts." That's funny? It's funny 'cause you think I was talking about you. I was probably talking about my mom. Yeah. Of course. Silly of me. But is there something you want to tell me? Anything buried deep in your subconscious mind that you're just dying to get out? Oh, hey, did the insurance thing get taken care of? - Mm-hmm. - Good. Ste, I want you to touch me. Hey. I want you to touch me. Hey, you know that charity ball you're going to tonight at the museum? Mm-hmm. Wong gave me two tickets for employee of the month, so I'll see you with Stevens. Oh, God. That'll be awkward. Maybe we'll disappear for five minutes. Jake, no, don't joke. If he caught us, he would kill us. - Maybe. - You met him. He's old-school macho, territorial. Well, it's gorgeous territory. So you say. You know, the point is he, uh... he thinks he owns it. - Doesn't he? - Not anymore. Hey, you, uh... you remember the hotel? Of course I do, vividly. You said something, almost as if you were implying that Ste should have an accident. No, just that... That it'd be natural to have that kind of fantasy. Mm. Well, if you're speaking of fantasy. Well, three's my lucky number. Yeah? Councilman Peck at 3:00. Between Angie's Louboutins, private schools, office overhead, I'm drowning. Mayday. Hey, Brooke, looking fancy. If I disappeared, nobody would care except you and Tara. That's not... Buck would care. Care? He wouldn't even notice. "Sure is sleeping a lot. Maybe she's depressed." Brooke, what I really want to talk about is a certain someone who was sighted at the No-Tell bar with a handsome stranger. - Dish, Brookie. - I don't know what you mean. - Brooke. - I was signing papers. Brooke, you're not. No, it's... it is not what you think. - Mm-hmm. - No judging here. We're your friends, and we know how unhappy you've been. I think it's great. Get some while you can. Brooke, are you okay? Brooke, I don't mean to freak you out, but Ste is walking this way. - Ladies. - Hi, Ste. Ste, I'm sorry, but this is a ladies only conversation. The mysteries I could learn from that. Both: But unfortunately, I'm going to have to steal my wife. Oh, uh, how'd it go with the councilman? - The prick is avoiding me. - Mm. - I might need your help later. - Mm. It's a disaster since Mom learned how to text. - There's Wong. - Oh. Ste, good to see you. Looking good. Thank you. You better hope so. You got 15 mil riding on it. Mr. Wong, my beautiful wife. Great to finally meet you, Mrs. Stevens. Heard all about you from Jake. He is such a sweet boy. Will you excuse me though? I need to use the ladies' room. Are you waiting for someone? Maybe. Isn't Cinderella waiting for you? Ah, I forgot to ask you. Are you wearing any panties? Excuse me? Looking for a woman who isn't wearing any. Ah. That must be hard to find. The hunt is the best part. - Are you? - Wearing? Mm. You'll, uh... you'll have to see for yourself. Oh. Oh, my, you're not wearing any. - Good. - Have you ladies seen Brooke? Well, maybe if you paid more attention to her, you wouldn't have to look. She hasn't been herself lately. She's fine. If you say so, but if there's anything I can do for her, please let me know. Well, maybe it's what you should do to her. - Sounds good. - Shall we? Well, yes. I can't... I can't stand this, not having you. I need you every day, every night, every minute. Divorce him. So what? We'll have nothing, but we'll have each other. I came from nothing, Jake. If I go back, I'll die. I will wither and die. You'll wither and die if you stay with him. Who's texting at this hour? Mom just figured out what emojis are. Oh, God. She's losing at the slots. She wants to come visit. No. Hell no. Write her a check. I cannot handle a visit from your mother right now. No way. I have to go to Miami tomorrow. - Again? - For Christ sakes, it's one night. We need this. It's another backup deal. That's why you went to... To New Orleans. God! Everything we have is tied up. What do you want from me? If you want to talk... There's nothing for you to concern yourself about. Just trying to be here for you. I want to help. Okay, well, when you get your real estate license, you can go out and work, and I'll stay home. You know, sometimes I think you just want me gone. Divorce, new life, new wife, is that it? Really? You want to have that argument right now, huh? Next do you want to talk about why we don't have kids, hmm? Hmm? Maybe you want an affair, hmm? New man, new life. Do you want to be married? I want you to tell me we're okay. We're okay. When you texted, "What do we do?" what did you mean? What did you think I meant? We're talking about something, Jake. What are we talking about? A better life for both of us. We can't go on this way, and yeah, we're talking about something, and you know exactly what it is even if you can't say it out loud. Hey, hey, it's me. Can... can Sylvester watch the kids for a while? I need to come over and talk. Can you call Ang? Okay, bye. What am I doing? Okay, spill it. I think I'm gonna ask Ste for a divorce. Are you sure? It's it because of that guy? No. Well, yeah... Yes, maybe. I... I don't know. You don't want to get divorced. You really think your little sex toy is gonna stick around once you're broke? He's just looking for some rich bitch to pay his way. Okay, that's not true. Ste doesn't love me anymore. I... quite frankly, I am done pretending. - Ang, if she's not happy... - Happy's a relative term. But if you're not willing to work and sacrifice for it, then it's time to move on. Make a clean break and end it. I got to go. Ste's a sure thing, Brooke. Don't forget that. Oh, you okay? I got you a gun. Be sure to go to a gun range and learn how to use this first. I slept with someone. I think that means we should get a divorce. Wh... why? You're not happy, Ste. I don't... I don't make you happy anymore. I love you. I don't want to lose you. This is my fault. It's not your fault. I haven't been paying enough attention to you. - Ste, that's not... - No, don't say anything. This land development deal, it's... it's killing me. I'm sorry. I got us into this mess. I got us into this whole mess. It's my fault. You did not... this is not your fault. This whole... whole baby thing has completely messed me up. I do not want to lose you, okay? I don't want to lose you. Let's... let's go to the mountains this weekend, just you and me, okay? Like old times, we'll forget about everything. - Okay. - Yeah. - Jake, you look like... - Yeah, I know, thank you. I look... I'm fine. I just didn't get a ton of sleep last night. I'm feeling a little burnt out. My hotshot hadn't sold a policy in... Please don't worry. I got a couple leads tonight. That'll get me back up to speed. All right. Hi, honey, I'm gonna go check in with the concierge. Oh, you, uh... you want me to go? No, no, no, you stay, relax. I want this weekend to be perfect. I'll see if they have any trail maps. - Wh... what are you doing here? - You texted me. Why would you tell me where you're at unless you wanted me to come find you? Oh, my God, that is not why. Jake, you can't be here. You have to go. You... No, this can't work. Hmm? Has it occurred to you how much older I am? Ooh, I like an experienced woman. You know what you want. We... we can't go on like this forever. Why not? Maybe great sex is your fountain of youth. I... I told him, and he doesn't want to let me go. Come here. Tomorrow, spread out. You take the lower trail. Let him take the ridge trail. There's an abandoned lodge up there on the overlook. I'll take care of it. It'll look like an accident. Tomorrow she'll be dead, and the money will be ours. Wonderful. This is fun, reminds me of our honeymoon. - Oh, shit. - What? I'm such an idiot. I left my headphones. Oh, let's go back. No, that's okay. I'll go get them. I'll run down real quick. I'll meet you at the top at the ridge. I'll be right back. God, Jake, pick up. Pick up, damn it. Oh, my God, it's you. Did you do it? - No. - Oh, thank God. Jake, we can't, okay? It just is a mistake. We would live with it for the rest of our lives. We'll do what you said, okay? I'll divorce him, and we can run off together. What? What is it? Jake? Jake? What'd she look like? Her expression when you pushed her? You said she hated you, and she would jump at the chance to kill you. Yeah. She was sleeping around all over Buckhead. She changed her mind. You didn't do it. Why? Are you in love with her? Oh, Christ almighty, you are. She got to you. - Did she? - You're not thinking clearly. I think I'm thinking very clearly, thank you. It's time, Jake. She used me. She married me for my money. She never loved me, not one single minute. She cheated on my any chance she got. You proved how easily she would do it. You married her. That is what we are trying to fix. God, I need that 15 million, otherwise I am ruined. Fifteen? Oh, come on. Of course we're gonna split it. That goes without saying. If it goes without saying, why did you just say something different? Oh, my God. What does it matter who has the money? We'll be together. You having qualms, Jake? Hmm? I didn't think they were in your repertoire. - I didn't think so either. - You liar! Before Jake I never slept with anyone but you. - No. - I loved you. That's not true. You only married me to get away from your trailer trash mother. That's not true. You're a whore, and I loved you. Hey! Jake. He didn't... he didn't love me? He... he was gonna kill me for money to save his... his... We were killing him for money. He was just being honest about it. We were doing it for love, Jake. And the money to enjoy our love. Love? Is that what this is? Yes. I don't usually feel things, Brooke, but with you, with you I do. I really... I do. Okay, all right, okay. The police will think he leaned too far over the edge for the good shot, and he fell. Remember, he was crazy about getting the best shots. You need to go now, to the other trail, and remember if you see anyone, say something memorable. Go. Just... Ah. Damn you. Thank you. You have a package. - Yes? - Hey, it's me. What is this? It's a precaution. It's disposable, cheap, untraceable. Yeah, but why? Why now? We cannot see each other, not for a while. They're doing due diligence since the policy was taken out so recently. It's nothing that I didn't anticipate. Well, if you anticipated it, you would have given this to me sooner. You miss me? Jake? Do you miss me? Yes. Of course, terribly. Ah, Jake. Corporate's not happy. Yeah, I'll bet. What's your angle, the wife? Got to be. Are there any scratches on him from her fingernails or... No, just from the fall, but there's an autopsy in process. Hey, Jake? You didn't sleep with her, did you? I flirt, Wong. Past that, things get messy. Yeah, it's me. I need you back at the office. Oh, Brooke, oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I can't imagine what you must be going through. One moment someone you love is there, and then... how could this happen? You're here. That's what matters. Angie didn't even call. Oh, sweetie, don't think. She just doesn't deal with death well. And what am I, a pro? She's got a touch of the stomach flu. She loves you, 'kay? She'll be at the memorial. You don't find it strange that a man with so much hiking experience could just fall like that? - What are you saying? - Well, hypothetically, what if... what if it wasn't an accident? Yeah, who would want Ste dead? We all have secrets. Oh, you mean a lover? Yeah, maybe if Ste were interested in sex. Or maybe it was money, gambling problems, a bookie, a creative hit man? I mean, we... We are facing bankruptcy, so who knows? I am so sorry. I didn't mea... I'm just trying to protect you. From what? The thing is if it wasn't an accident, people on TV always suspect the wife. - Okay, so what's my motive? - Is there life insurance? God, do you... do you have a reason to believe that this wasn't an accident? Of course not. No, I'm just thinking like they do, and there was a car parked outside. It drove off when I came up. I know. Hey, I'm not as helpless as you think I am. Uh, Jake, this is Mike Wall, investigator on the Stevens case. - It's a case now? - There's been a development. A button on Stevens' vest had a partial print. Not his? Well, the feds are checking the database. I got a friend. All right, well, if I can help in any way. See you at the funeral. Seems like a nice guy. Yeah, I wouldn't take it that far. But he's good at his job. Go comfort the wife, see what you can find. I'm sorry for your loss, Mrs. Stevens. They are trying to deny your claim. The police gave it the all-clear, but the bastards in Hartford hired an investigator to look into it. How are you holding up? - I'm holding up. - They're watching us. Do not contact me under any circumstances, and be careful of that investigator, Wall. - Mrs. Stevens, condolences. - Thank you. I'm Mike Wall with the insurance company. Sorry to interrupt, but let me explain. Your husband had what's considered a suspicious death, and if in the event there was foul play, we're hoping you can help. - I... I don't understand. - Well, people at his office say he was talking about disappearing. Perhaps he was going into hiding, or maybe he was afraid for his life. No, that's... that's crazy. Well, we'd like to come by your home and check his computer. Oh, by any chance, have you seen his iPad? I mean, who knows what we might discover? No. Uh, what do you hope to find? Well, an email on his cell suggests there might be another account, another email address that isn't in his name or on his phone. We think he downloaded messages on his iPad or home computer. Well, his iPad is... is not at home, but I can look for it and get back to you. Well, may we come by and look for it? Strangers pawing through my underwear drawer on the day of my husband's funeral? No, thank you. Yeah, well, people who die accidentally don't first dispose of their electronics. - I said I'd get back to you. - Yes, and if you don't, I'll see you at your home with a warrant in hand. This is inappropriate. You should be ashamed of yourself. You went to Venice with Irene? Who the hell is Irene? Oh, hey. Robert Lange? Okay, let's try this again. Brooke, if you're getting this, that means that I've left it for you, and if I left it for you, that means I've left you. But not... not just you. I've left myself, our life. When I heard about your affairs, it devastated me, but I don't blame you. I'm a failure in everything. In marriage, in business, in everything. No, no, it's too humiliating. Yes. Oh, there, buddy. What the hell? Carlita, can you take the trash out? Brooke? We pray to thee, our God, this day for the blessings you provide. You haven't answered my texts. I hate you. I don't know why I'm here. You're here to renew our sacred vows. No, I'm not doing this anymore. I'm being followed. We shouldn't even be meeting. - Beneath thy almighty wing. - You sure? Jake, did you not hear what I said? Oh, God, the spirit of all our joys, the cause of our delights, the glory of our darkest nights, the comfort in times like these. There is only one way to live for people like us, Brooke. We have to risk everything. That risk is what we crave to feel alive. It turns you on. We need to feel something, and we need it desperately. Jake, we can't do this. What, God doesn't approve of sex? He invented sex. Both: This is crazy. We could get caught. Mm-hmm. That's why you don't want me to stop. You filmed yourselves. Jake, I watched it all. Not me, him. I didn't know. Whenever you weren't together, you were with me, and he was with this Irene. She was just loose change, his words, not mine. You two just screw whatever. Man, woman, don't matter. That matters. They're different. Yeah, I'm aware. What about Ste? Closeted? Bisexual? What is the difference? I mean, we're all just the same, right? We're just trying desperately to connect to someone, anyone. I was married to someone that I didn't have a clue about. And I don't know who the hell you are. I'm not sure you're still with me, Brooke. I need to trust that you and I are together. I am sorry about this. Insurance in case you... I mean, you know, I am in the insurance industry. - You have killed 12 people? - Give or take. Say what the job is. If you're arrested on her word, I kill the bitc. What's your weapon of choice? Glock and silencer. I said I was sorry. If it's any consolation, the insurance scam was my idea. I put Stevens up to it. He was desperate. When I realized that he was planning an "accidental" suicide to leave you the money, I figured out a way for me to make money in the process. Look, Brooke, things turned out this way because I fell in love with you. I chose you. - My coffee cup's missing. - Maybe it's in the sink. I, uh, like to visualize. Possible third person, mystery man or woman. Looking at the way that Stevens was found, forensics thinks that he fell backwards. Meaning? More than likely he was pushed. Or he was taking a selfie. The view up there really is quite something. Is it really? That's what I hear. I wouldn't know. I prefer tarmac to trees. Mm. Hello? Of course there's a liability hazard. The signs were obscured. There was no railing, and it's your property. Wh... then make me a good offer. Thank you. I accept. Mrs. Stevens, we have a warrant to search these premises. You were right. It was in the sink, only I didn't put it there. Jake, where were you the morning that Stevens died? I tried to reach you. You didn't come in till mid-afternoon. - When do I usually come in? - Afternoon. - Why is that? - Well, the thing is that the policy you gave me was dated the night before the murder. Murder? Oh, sorry, sorry, not proven. The night before Stevens died, that policy. You know, I, uh, had to call the insured. Couldn't read his handwriting. Yeah, well, with computers now, no one can write anymore. Your insured said he bought the policy earlier. The night in question he was with his sister. Maybe I accidentally entered the wrong date. Come on, boss, are you really accusing me of being involved in this? Check my phone records. That'll tell you where I was. - We did. - Mm. Thank you for your faith in me. You know corporate's first thought, agent is co-conspirator. We had to get you off their radar. Tell them to do something anatomically impossible. Look, Wall took your prints off that cup. That's why it was in the sink. Again, only to eliminate you. Thank you for saying that. How's the real investigation coming? The police checked Mrs. Stevens' phone records. Shows calls coming in and out from the cell phone and a disposable. Like this? The calls stopped when Stevens died. Why don't the cops just trace the phone? The SIM card was removed and the phone destroyed. Convenient, huh? Jake, they're on it. I thought you needed to know. Told you it wasn't here. You can let yourselves out. Hey. Hey, honey, I was thinking about you. Do you need me to come over? No, I'm fine. You really shouldn't be alone right now. You know what? You're right. Hey, Tara, do we know an Irene? - I don't think so. - Hmm. Yeah, remember your trip to Italy? Is that where you met that model? Why? Just, uh... doesn't matter. I'll see you soon. Angie, what are you... What are you doing here? You startled me. - We need to talk. - Okay. About what? How'd you like Venice, Irene? A lot. It didn't seem like a bad thing to do to one of your best friends? - Were we ever really friends? - Well, I did think so. You know, the... the funny thing is I, uh... I thought that Tara was Irene. Venice was a scouting expedition to see where we'd go once we had the money and the baby was born. Remember, stomach flu? I'm eight weeks in, and it is not Buck's. Believe me, he couldn't get it up with a forklift and a bottle of blues. I want half for me and the baby. Otherwise I make a claim, and you get nothing. I'm sorry, how's that? The claim would be for Stevens' child. In a few weeks they can do a DNA test to prove paternity, at which point little Stevens would be the beneficiary, not you. Check the policy. Trust me, that's what it says, and here's the kicker. The policy pays us even if you killed Ste. And being the mother, you would get a generous living allowance. You create a trust to receive the insurance. Once paternity's proved that it's Stevens' child, you and the baby will split 50/50. Is Tara in on this? No, no, she's your actual friend. I just told her. She's my insurance if you attempted to kill me too. Okay, I didn't kill Ste. You will let me know by tomorrow. Otherwise I make my claim. And, uh, thanks for the cookies. They were delicious. - I don't know, Brooke. - Please, Tara? For old time's sake? Yeah, I don't want anything big, just the three of us. - Well, okay then. - You're an angel. Tomorrow at 5:00? Bye. Angie, it's me. We have a deal. Mr. Wong, this is Brooke Stevens. Jake, uh, you'll never guess who's here to see you. Judging by your excitement, it wouldn't be Mrs. Stevens, would it? Oh, you're good. Oh, and Wall's fingerprint report will be here today. Hi, Mrs. Stevens. Can I get you something, coffee, water? You and the police have searched my husband's office, my house, watched my house, had me followed. Why? It's all perfectly normal. You're the beneficiary and the spouse. Statistically speaking, you're doubly suspect. You think I killed my husband? Conjecture's for amateurs. I simply explore secondary explanations. Now, I'm glad we're having this talk, Mrs. Stevens. I admire a forthright person. Do you mind if I ask you an equally direct question? Sure. I mean, you haven't answered mine, but I'll go first. How long after you're paid, if you're paid, do you intend to leave town? Well, I... I don't remember the word for the smallest possible increment of time. The reason why I ask, Wall's found evidence of a possible accomplice. As of now we've come to no conclusions, but if we do, it could implicate you. Yeah. The resort has already paid $1 million in negligence. I'd appreciate if you could expedite your payment also. I'll see what I can do. Have a good day. Hey. Thanks again for doing this. What are we eating? I'm starving. Oh. I wasn't expecting you. Surprise. I thought we could celebrate. Damn, I'd have brought balloons. Angie, you did me a favor. You know, you took Ste off my hands, or to be more specific, my body. My pleasure. Well, I hope so 'cause it wasn't mine. Look, as... as weird as this may sound, you two are kind of my only friends here, so I can hold a grudge, or I can remember the good times. Is this for real? I'll just give you two a moment. If she tries to kill you, shout. Half a million, cashier's check. I can't void it. We got the fingerprint final report. Looks like a match. - Really? - Yes. Unfortunately, it's a partial. It's the tip of a forefinger. It would never stand up in court. - I guess it's a washout. - Apparently. Oh, by the way, Mrs. Stevens settled her case against the resort. Really? How much? A million in cash, tax-free. What? I know you, Jake, since you were five. I know your tells. I see your tells. Angie miscarried. They found drugs in her system. I know. It's really easy to get prescriptions from Canada in the mail. What? How could you? Yeah, it's like... it's like we don't even know who the other is anymore. You never thought to ask what was in those cookies, did you? You're one coldblooded bitch. Well, that is a compliment coming from you, Angie. Don't feel too special though. I'm, uh... I'm not the only one that Ste played. When he was with you, he was screwing another man. Wrong. Ste wasn't smart enough for all of this. What are you saying? It was me. Stevens adored you, so much he was actually willing to kill himself to leave you insurance money. He wanted to save you from his shame of bankruptcy, but that would have been a waste of good money, so I convinced him that you were a philandering bitch, and that broke his heart. No, Jake said this was his idea. I'm sure he did. I didn't figure that shit would seduce Ste and cut me out, but obviously he was willing to do anything. Ste was weak and easy to manipulate. You bitch. You did this. You did... you did all of this. For money. You're no different than me. You murdered the one man that was willing to die for you. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't even know she was pregnant. Brooke? Brooke! Brooke, where are you? 911, what's your emergency? Help, someone's broken into my house. I know you're there. You got insurance money, and you didn't split it? I thought that might bother you. And if you don't split that with me, you can't even tell me about it? That's why I told Wong. That makes me insecure about that life insurance payout. I won't split the money. You seem to have forgotten something, Brooke. Who killed him? Who killed him? I can't remember. - You did. - Yes, of course I did. - But I told you not to, right? - Right. - And you did it anyway. - And that's my point. If I hadn't have done that, if I hadn't have done that, you would have nothing right now, just like me! Is that what you want, to shoot me? Maybe. Or maybe I'll wait. The Earth is small, Brooke. It is too small to hide. One day you'll turn around, and you will see my smiling face. I loved you, Jake. God, I loved you so much. Then why didn't you pay? 'Cause I was doing it for love. You can't love anyone. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. Do you have kids? Mm-hmm. Do not leave this laying around the house. Mr. Walters planned to blackmail your husband? About the affair, yes. Until he had a better idea. To kill Ste and blackmail me. We're not fools, Mrs. Stevens. That isn't exactly the most credible scenario. That's precisely what Jake said, and how he... How he blackmailed me. Who killed him? Who killed him? I can't remember. - You did. - Yes, of course I did. But I told you not to, right? Right. And you did it anyway. And that's my point. If I hadn't have done that, you would have nothing right now. I couldn't risk anymore. I had to shut it off. So you knew he was gonna kill your husband. Of course not. Yeah, but you knew afterwards, and you didn't come forward, and that makes you an accessory after the fact. Yes, but Jake was strategic. He showed me a video, which you will find on his cell phone, of him threatening to kill me if I went to the police. CSI just fished parts of two pink cell phones out of your disposal. Want to explain that? Not really. This should take care of your family for a while. Oh, thank you, Ms. Brooke. Mom, I've been thinking. Those Vegas slots, they really are something. Well, pack your bags 'cause we're going to Vegas tonight. I love you. Bye. Hope you don't think I'm incompetent. Not at all. Well, I'm impressed by... In a horrified way... By the way you've been able to manage all this. I, um, wired the money into your account. Here's your copy. I like the personal touch. Largest amount I've ever seen. You may not believe it, Mr. Wong, but I didn't want this. All I wanted, all I ever wanted was for my husband to love me, But that wasn't to be because that's not the world we've made. In this world we're born alone, we live alone, and we die in an even more desperate state of loneliness. Sometimes, for brief moments, we have the illusion of connection. Grab onto it, cherish it. You can judge me. I know you do. Growing up, were you hit every day instead of kissed? How about adolescence? Girls stare at your crotch the way boys leered at my breasts? Probably not. See, I found out that it doesn't matter if you come from nothing or you're born into luxury. The secret, the secret is to always wear a big, wide smile and hide your real self, 'cause if you don't, if... if they see who you really are, they will destroy you. So you give them what they want, your body, hide the rest. And then one day you look around, and where is it, that poor little self that you were protecting, that troubled soul or whatever you want to call it? It's gone because, sir, like our DNA, our souls are in every cell of our body. It's kind of a two-fer. Sell your body, soul comes with. Do you have any notion of what I'm talking about? No, you just want a confession. That would be nice. I didn't ask to play their game, but when I did, I played it better, and I won. So I confess that whatever you think I did, Probably did, but if you want regret, remorse, it's gonna be a little harder to come by. Thanks for the money.
