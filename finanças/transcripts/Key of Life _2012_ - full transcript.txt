VIP BOOKS Monthly editing schedule AH finished What's your criteria for the new part-timer? We need a robust, healthy hard worker Yes, Ma'am. Thank you all for your good work. Here's a copy of next month's schedule. On a more private note, I will be getting married. Seriously? Yes, but I will continue working. Who's the lucky man? I still haven't decided. I'd like to ask you all a favour. I've registered with a number of agencies and websites. But I'd like to explore all my options. If you know any suitable men looking to get married... please let me know. Would you consider someone working here? I've examined all the bachelors here... and found you all wanting. I see. What's your search criteria? It must be someone who is a robust, healthy hard worker. Yes, of course. Let's all do what we can to help. Do you have any particular date in mind? I've allocated one month to find someone. Another month to get to know him. That brings us to the second week in December. I understand. Let's do our best! I appreciate your efforts.

Public Bath Your change. - Don't squirt him. - He's out cold. - Looks bad. - You know him? - Never seen him before. - He needs an ambulance. His head hit hard. Let us through! Out of our way! - Move! - Is this his locker? These are his things? Thank you. Take him to the University Hospital. Roger that! We're on our way! Let's go! Hey Sakurai. Longtime, no see. What are you up to? Here. Sorry it took so long. You found a real job, did you? - Bye. - Wait... Takeshi? Moving day? Yes, I'm getting married. - I left a message; didn't you hear it? - Yes, I did. No one's heard from you. Anything happening? Nothing special. You should come by for a drink with the gang... What I owe you. Is that why you came? It's been on my mind. Sorry it took so long. Hey Rika! See you. Takeshi... I threw away most of your stuff, except for some photos. Don't need 'em. Takeshi. What now? You left the price tag on. You haven't changed. You're wrong there. Let me get those photos. In the garbage? Where are they? University Hospital Who are you? Do I know you? No. Sorry I'm having trouble remembering anything. Apparently I hit my head. They say I fell over at the bath house. Who are you? I was at the bath house. I was worried about you. You don't remember anything? Takeshi Sakurai... That's my name, they said. Excuse me. Get well soon. What about this? Hey Sakurai! Mr Landlord. Are you okay? They said you had amnesia. I'm fine. You are? That's a relief. The hospital said you had nothing with you, so I brought some of your things. Your wallet, phone and some clothes, too. Thanks, but the amnesia's gone. Do you remember how much rent you owe? - I'll pay now. - You have it? No major damage. Memory loss is quite rare in such cases. You just need time. It doesn't mean it's gone forever. I managed to get in touch with your landlord. My landlord? Apparently both your parents are dead. You have no other family And you're currently looking for work. Name: Takeshi Sakurai Age: 35 Blood type: A Family: none Status: Unemployed Belongings: key, tax bill Total cash: 1 ,142 yen A full coffee set? Why can't a woman hit on a man? Kanae, you want coffee? No thanks. Still busy as always. Just a little. When do I get to meet this fellow you're dating? It's not easy for a man to meet his girl's dad. It's a lot of pressure on him. - But they're getting married. - Yes, but still. Don't leave it too late. I could be dead by then. You're not dying! Doesn't he believe us? He refuses to be convinced. He's too scared. Yes, I'm scared - I want to live till I'm 85! You can meet him after you get discharged. Discharged? You think I ever will? Let's go have something nice for dinner. I can't, I've got something on. A date? Go enjoy yourself. Just because you've decided, doesn't mean you'll find someone. Have I ever failed at anything before? That's the problem. Excuse me... Is this address over that way? Yes, over there. Within walking distance? It'll take about 30 minutes. Really? Thank you. Excuse me! I have a car. - I really appreciate this. - Not at all. My name's Kanae Mizushima, I'm 34 years old. Takeshi Sakurai, I'm supposed to be 35. But I look older, don't I? Not at all. "Supposed to be"? I don't remember. I say... Are you sure you'll be alright? Physically I'm fine, they said. Quite robust and healthy ls your memory returning? I'm working hard at it. Excuse me. Anything coming back to you? Not really Please come on in. But I feel a familiarity with this place... A subtle sense of belonging. Can't you call someone listed on your phone? Izumino Station 7 am Today's the eighth, isn't it? Yes, it is. â€œHey, Mr Postman" - Mushroom Productions Do you think this means you're an actor? An actor? My company also publishes a theatrical magazine. The editor may know something. Should I ask him? Good idea. I appreciate it. Sorry I really should be going. Did you find your phone? Not yet. I'll come back later. A man's no good if he can't make money Sweet words alone will never satisfy a woman. Not a penny to his name, all he's got is love. That's shameful. Don't you agree? No, I don't. I'm Sakurai. I live next door. You probably know... - Know what? - Know me. You're Sakurai, from next door, right? Is my game-playing too noisy? No. I'm Sakurai, from 202. Pleased to meet you. This is about my cat, isn't it? Honestly I couldn't live without her. Please don't tell the landlord. Of course not. Dear Mr Yamazaki, please forgive me... I'm so very sorry I'm the one who stole your money. I'm the real Takeshi Sakurai. But that doesn't matter now... because I've decided. I'll kill myself to atone. But not in your apartment. In a park, or somewhere. I may have to borrow a stout rope. I just wanted to apologise for everything. Tokyo District Attorney's Office Kenji Yoshida Kitakanagawa City Employee Takebuchi Surgeon Yasuo Tokushima Sales Dept. Yoshiki Mizuno Needs: Information, food, map, transportation, medical treatment Cash Hello? Is that Mr Kondo? It's me, Fujimoto. This is unusual... I only ever get your machine. It's the first time we've spoken. I was wondering how to pay your fee. My fee; Mr Kudo insisted I ask you. How much? The amount? Five million yen. Tell me where and H! arrange it. Leave it somewhere? Yes, by noon tomorrow. You choose where. The mailbox in front of the apartment block. Izumino Station Ms Dobashi. Mr Arai. Ms Kamata. Mr Sakurai. - Mr Sakurai? - I'm Sakurai. On the bus, please. Sotoda Films Location Bus Sotoda Films Location Bus Morning. Morning. We don't need so many extras. Just one hard-faced, gangster-type. Can you do that? - A gangster? - Get him a costume. That's the face I want! Get ready He'll do. Him, too. Yes. Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes, why not? Good. I'll arrange to contact them. He just scrapes in. - That's my husband! - Forgive me. I asked about that Mushroom theatrical group. Did you learn anything? He's never heard of Takeshi Sakurai, but he does know Mushroom Productions. They went broke 2-3 years ago and closed down. You were at the hospital. You've recovered? No, I still can't remember anything. Why...? I was worried. The hospital gave me your address. How very kind. Come on upstairs. - You don't remember a thing? - Nothing. Are you alright? These are supposed to be my brand. Hello again. Please come in. You found one of your friends, did you? - Not really - Hello. Are you from the hospital? No, we met in front of the hospital. What's the relationship here? He was at the bath house when I hurt myself. What was your name? - I'm Kondo. - I'm Mizushima. I found out your theatrical troupe went out of business. That doesn't surprise me. Did you find something? It seems I wrote out a suicide note. Suicide? Look at how poorly written it is. That proves I was out of my mind. "Dear Landlord, please forgive me..." But you didn't die. Obviously I failed. How exactly did I fall over? You stepped on a piece of soap. I probably did it on purpose. To kill myself. The chances of dying would be very slim. I'm 35 years old, no job, no prospects. Living alone, in this dump, that's reason enough, isn't it? I'd better get going. Let's throw this away Are you okay? I've forgotten why I wanted to kill myself. What's more important is what I do from now on. Are you hungry? Hungry? Yes, I am. I have to check out a restaurant. You can join me. For work? - Expensive? - The magazine pays. Yes, I'll go. Mr Kondo? Mr Kudo would really like to see you. We have a car ready to take you. You like skewer-broiled chicken? I don't remember. Go play pachinko. Sorry about the shabby surroundings. You're a lot younger than I thought. Thanks for fixing the Mr Iwaki problem. Forgive me. I wanted to see you because a problem has come up. Is Iwaki's body still in the trunk? A silly question to ask such a pro. My man saw you at work; he was very impressed. From afar, but I was very moved. But we couldn't find the money We searched his house, his bank: it's nowhere to be found. I'm sure you recognise Iwaki's lover. An ex-bar girl. She lives alone with her son. They were engaged; she has to know where it is. One of my men got inside and searched the place. But found nothing. I was hoping you could find a way to make her talk. The dispose of her, too. Make it look like she's missing, so they'll never find the body Answer that. Hello? Sakurai? Didn't you pay the hospital? You must slop walking away, leaving bills unpaid. Go do it tomorrow. I understand. After this job, I'll owe you 10 million yen. As you're well aware, this must remain our secret. Unfortunately I can't let you refuse the contract. Okay that's my work finished. - I've ordered for us. - Thank you. Our magazine introduces a high-quality item every month. This month it's chairs, next month, salt. Salt? Surprisingly there's a vast number of different salts available. This restaurant especially... Didn't you taste the salt at my place? Did I do that? Yes, I thought it rather strange. But I didn't know how to ask why Sorry I'm afraid it's become a habit. When I see salt, I just have to taste it. Is that right? Enjoy your meal. This really is delicious. Things I like: Movies, theatre? Cup noodles? Marlboro, cookies... Skewer-broiled chicken What's that? A compilation... A list of things I've learned. And what I must do. Job: Film extra Character: Unorganised Finances: No fixed income Cash: 1 ,142 yen Possessions: Suicide note, rope, noose... You're very meticulous. Quite a turnaround in such a short time. The police could help if you showed them this. That's what the doctor said. But, to be honest... I'm scared. I don't want others to define me. I want to find out for myself who I am. I've already learned quite a lot about me. Perhaps I'm better off not finding out any more. I also like writing everything down. You're a busy woman. Wedding Ceremony You're getting married? That's the plan, but first I need to find the right man. I can't just marry anyone. Plus, he'll have his own criteria. It's harder than I thought. My sister's been married twice. Here you are. VIP Magazine Chief Editor Kanae Mizushima Chief editor? That's impressive. The salt was my idea. They give me free rein. And you're an actor, aren't you? Not a very successful one, I'm afraid. No one knows who I am. - Thanks for dinner. - Not at all. See you. Look... Would you consider becoming my friend? We're friends already aren't we? Still no reconciliation with your husband? Why should I? He's in the wrong, not me. It's my choice to forgive him, or not. Then hurry up and decide. How long do you plan to stay at home? - Have you found anyone to marry you? - Not yet... But there is one man I could love. - That won't work. - Why not? Do you need to be in love to marry? Of course. That's how I've planned it. What? When you were young, didn't your heart ever ache? What's that? That indescribable feeling where your heart aches so sweetly You only get it when you think of that one man. But that goes away once you pass 30. Especially when looking for someone to marry I think the mechanism breaks. So, be like me, forget about marrying for love. Like you? Basic Internet President Iwaki CEO of Iwaki Industries vanishes Without Trace Kondo: Legendary Underworld Mr Fix-it Cut! - Okay - That's a wrap! Hey Sakurai. That was brilliant. Such depth of character. What is acting? - He'll do. - Not a chance. Just. I'll set it up. How about tonight? - No, I'm busy tonight. - Alright then. I'd like to talk to the Editor. Who shall I say is calling? One moment, please. Who is Kondo, the shadowy handyman? - Dynamite Magazine - Who is Kondo, the shadowy handyman? - Dynamite Magazine - He started out as a legitimate handyman, a general dogsbody. He was very good: thorough and professional. Eight years ago, he closed down the business. He went full-time into crime. Why Crime? The money obviously Have you ever met him? No, he refuses to deal directly with clients. I'd give anything for even an old photo of him. Do you think he killed Mr Iwaki? I can't say But when it is Kondo's handiwork... they never find the body He's extremely meticulous. Kondo leaves no evidence. There's nothing for the cops to work with. The victim simply disappears. Two of us get on, the other two swim. Swim along behind it. That'll be 1,850 yen. Out of 2,000 yen. Your change. Thank you. Welcome, sir. Something about me, sir? Dynamite Magazine Chief editor: Kenji Otani You work for a magazine? I have noticed some suspicious men nosing around lately Probably connected to Mr Iwaki's disappearance. Do you think he's... dead? Why would anyone kill him? I know he was involved with all kinds of people. What about the police? They've put him on the Missing Persons list. We were engaged to be married. I gave up bar-hostessing to be with him. Did he leave anything with you before he disappeared? Money perhaps? Money? He paid for my apartment. No, more like a large sum of cash. If there was any cash... I'd use it to kill those who took him. Have you ever truly been in love? All books on acting? Yes. If I'm to act, I need to study up on it. After all, it seems likely I was an actor. Perhaps it's too late, though. Not at all. Acting is about getting into another person's skin. You need to live another's experiences. It's actually quite interesting. I'd love to see you act. Please show me sometime. I'll work hard at it. First, I need to find some sort of paying job. Really? We're looking for a part-timer. You're hired. It's delicious. Really? That's good. I tried it out on my sister yesterday She made a number of suggestions, so I made some changes. You're so dedicated, so committed. I'm sorry Please excuse me. Character traits: Pessimistic. Untidy Wasteful. Lack of planning... Character traits: Pessimistic. Untidy Wasteful. Lack of planning... When I'm with you, I feel safe. When I'm with you, I feel safe. Over-emotional When I'm with you, I feel safe. Over-emotional Over-emotional Please forgive me. Please forgive me. I can't stop crying. Truly... I wish there was some way I could thank you. Marry me. Won't it work? It won't work? I'm sure we could make it work. But, I mean, look at my current condition. Not a penny to my name... Couldn't you make the effort? Together, couldn't we strive to make marriage work? Do you really think I'm worthy of you? More than ever. Hello? It's me, Fujimoto. How are things coming along? I said I'd call when it's done. Yes, t know. But the sooner, the better. I'll be in touch. Okay listen up... You're forcing it. It's not enough, especially if I buy souvenirs. You're going camping, not shopping. Clean up your room before you go. Coming. - Where are you going? - Summer camp. - I didn't order pizza. - I'm leaving. Take care. Escape? Where to? I've got a place, a room for your son, too. Why would anyone want to kill me? Didn't Iwaki tell you anything? What was he involved in? I don't know, but you've got to get away If I don't kill you, someone else will. He'll be a pro. No cop can protect you. - Just exactly who are you? - Does it matter? Look, I've made a plan. I'll be waiting for you after work tomorrow. Your boy has a phone? But why are you going to all this trouble? Why? If not me, who? I'll be wearing a wig... Delicious. Here are some wedding options to consider. Naturally I'm willing to listen to your input. No, I didn't mean that. Do we really need to rush this? Can't we get to know each other and clarify our feelings? Wait until love overwhelms us. Wait till we're overwhelmed? I think that will come naturally after marriage. Excuse me. Hello? My father just died. We've been expecting it for a while. I would like to thank you all for coming here today. Ideally, I'd like lo thank each and every one of you. But, since I'm dead, that's no longer possible. Life never works out as we expect it to. He actually made this? Yes, he organised a studio and everything. Then he must have known. I've been a lucky man. Blessed with a fine home, a car, clothes, good food. Everything a man needs to live a good life. But, lei me tell you, none of it means a thing. For I have received an even greater blessing. The love and companionship of my beloved wife, Kyoko. And we have both been blessed with two loving daughters. My darling Shoko and Kanae. I'm sorry Can we film that again? Edit it out later? Anyway! Kanae, congratulations on your marriage! Unfortunately, I won't get to see you in your wedding dress. It's the wrong DVD. Stop it there! Kanae's Wedding No, wait. Kanae, please find happiness. To the groom: Despite not knowing you... you will be Kanae's husband. Please treat her we... Should you ever mistreat her, or make her unhappy... I'll come back and put a death wish on you. I'm not joking, I mean it. But, let's put that aside. Congratulations to both of you. Are you okay? He really worried about my marriage prospects. He wanted me to wed before he died. You're doing it for your father? Not anymore. At first, yes. But not any longer. I've always been something of a coward. I'm not good at relationships, or falling in love. Don't you think loving someone can be frightening? But I've made up my mind. I'll be a loving wife and I'll learn to love my husband. I think... I'm sure I could grow to love you, Mr Sakurai. My father loved this old stereo system. He said records give a better sound. Look... A string quartet playing Beethoven. My father's favourite... He had another favourite... This is the one that I like. I took the precaution of bugging Ayako's place. Escape? Where to? I've got a place, a room for your son, too. What do you mean by "escape"? I was very surprised when I heard the tape. She's not at home, nor at work. You're meeting her, aren't you? Get out! What now?! - You go watch Ayako's place. - Yes, sir. You... You've been smoking in here. Why have you been checking up on Mr Iwaki? How did Kudo find this place? - I didn't tell him. - Were you followed? You wouldn't even know. Come here. Did you lock the door? Did you lock the front door behind you? You're going to tell me everything. You call these scribbles a plan? And why suddenly decide to save her? Did you want someone to finally appreciate you? Shut up. I'll save you. On one condition... I get to take over your identity Hello, Mr Kudo? Who's this? My name's Yoshida. I work for Kondo. Where's Kondo now? I'm not quite sure. Is there a possibility I could join your gang? What? Kondo's finished. Finished? Yes, there's a contract out on him. Whose contract? Kataoka's gang, I think. Two of Kataoka's men got hit two years ago. The trail led back to Kondo. I've got no idea what he's thinking. I just want to distance myself from him. The thing is, I'm supposed to go meet him. Do you want to know where? If we get Kondo, I'll consider it. Iwaki had some crooked deal going with Kudo. But Iwaki ended up with all the money His fiancÃ©e, Ayako, used to be Kudo's girl. Iwaki stole his money and his woman. For a gangster, that's fatal. He hired me to clean up before the story got out. So how will you... fix it? Kill you, in front of Kudo. - Are you serious? - What's wrong? Listen, kid... A knife to the gut doesn't kill you right off. First, you feel shock, then realisation... then the pain kicks in. Once more. - You've got it all wrong. - What's wrong? Where's the shock? You look down, see blood, realisation kicks in. You barely looked surprised. Think how it looks to them. I felt every emotion! Maybe you did, but you didn't show it! I'm a trained Method actor. I need to dredge this through my emotions. You had the textbook, yes. But you didn't get past page 8. Same with all your books on acting. You think that buying them makes you a better actor. You're all show; there's nothing to you. I'm being preached to by a hitman? Once more, from the top. I'll get you some ID you can use for life. You have no family right? That makes it easy Aren't you married? I was, but we divorced eight years ago. Rather, she ran away That was back when I was a working stiff. I had no money; she ended up marrying some rich guy By that door. There won't be any traffic at this hour. Only Kudo. When I stick you, he'll be watching, so get it right. What if he realises I'm acting? Your life depends on your acting. Don't worry: it's easy to fool most people. It worked when Iwaki and I pulled it off. I'm a fix-it guy not a cold-blooded killer. Do you know how many people go missing each year? Some pay big money to completely disappear. So Iwaki's still alive? When Kudo came to me, the first thing I did was tell Iwaki. He paid me the going rate. Now he's playing golf in Okinawa. Does Ayako know? No, that would only put her in danger. But he really does love her. So, the magazine article was all lies? Yes, and it was me who created those rumours. I attached my name to many unsolved crimes. It cost me a lot of money Whenever I get a contract to kill someone... I'd warn them and collect payment from both sides. That requires perfect planning. I made a lot of money More than enough. Mr Sakurai! What are you doing? Get in! You followed me here? Even you make mistakes! Shut up! Get us somewhere safe! Somewhere safe? I hope no one's moved in. You were a handyman? Yes. If he's the real Sakurai... - then who are you? - My name's Yamazaki. Are you a criminal, Mr Yamazaki? I don't actually break any laws. And I try my very best to be ethical. - Are you married? - No, I'm not. - I'm divorced. - What are we going to do?! Shut up, you thief! You wrote a suicide note - why didn't you die? Why go take a bath? I got all sweaty I'll fix this. They can trace you through your car. What'll you do? They want money: if they get it, they'll leave us alone. Wait here until you hear from me. If you don't, go to the police. I'm so very sorry Any man would be proud to marry you. You'll find someone. Whose place is this? I used to live here. I never gave her back the key It's full of memories. Do you love him? Do you? - We're getting married. - So I heard... But do you love him? It's lucky you don't. What's lucky about it? He's very much in love with you. Hello? You emptied my cookie tin? To buy Ayako's apartment. You're very generous with my money Is that you, Kondo? You're with Ayako, aren't you? Bring her and the money here now. If you do, I'll forget everything. Otherwise, I'll torture this guy and find you anyway Then I'll give him to Kataoka. Both of you will die very painful deaths. What'll you do? You're safe. They don't know who you are. You'd better go home. What about the police? Too dangerous - they'd kill him anyway - So what will you do? - I don't know! First, I need to find Ayako. - I'll go with you. - What for? Because I'm going to marry him. - A man you don't even love? - I could learn to love him. Kondo found out I ratted to you. We had a fight, then we split up. That bastard stole all my money! Where is he now? I don't know. He never tells me anything. Mr Kudo, will you let me handle it for you? Howe? Kill him and the girl. Without involving you. Then can I join your gang? Forget that, just think about where he's likely to be. The lock was broken. They must have broken in. Don't! They're outside waiting for you. I know. What're you two doing here? Apartment for Sale Kondo bought her an apartment? Is he in love with her? Maybe. It makes sense: she's a good woman. New? STOP m Kondo's in there with her. Don't hurl my son! Good timing. Saves me calling you. Mr Kudo. A man's profession is like a work of art. I have my own way of doing things. First, I get them to trust me. How else would she tell me where the money is? As always, it went exactly as I planned. Until... Until you clowns barged in on my work. You ruined everything. Unfortunately this time... it's no work of art! I never planned on killing the boy But you left me no choice. I had to work on him before she'd tell the truth. Because of you assholes! She didn't have the money She'd never sacrifice her son for Iwaki's money Let's go. My men will clean up here. Even though there's no money you still pay for my services. And one more thing... He's not much good at anything, but he's still my man. I want him back. You think I'm stupid? I've seen dead bodies before. I know what fresh blood smells like. You should have used real blood. Where's the money? I told you, I don't have it. Shall I ask your son, then? Actually there's about 200 million yen in this apartment. This is a 1959 Les Paul, used by Eric Clapton. Worth at least 20 million at auction. This one's worth 10 million. These Galle lamps are worth over 10 million. That's an original Paul Klee. These toys, this cupboard, this bed... they're all vintage rarities. - They're easily worth over 2 million dollars. - She's lying! Are you sure? Yes, I'm an expert. Who are you? Doesn't matter. Was this Iwaki's idea? Kondo still trusts me. Let me kill him. Can you do it? Go ahead. Kondo, if I can cash these in, I'll be happy If you can keep this a secret, I'm willing to forget everything. Get a removals van here now. You've got no right! Calm down, or else. About Ayako... Try not to make her suffer too much. I understand. Hello, police? I see a burglary in progress. Three hoods broke the lock and went inside. Hirasawa Apartments, Number 108. Please come quickly I'll take Ayako and her boy to Okinawa. To cover the money you stole, plus my fee, I'll get Iwaki to pay. Why didn't you run? Why? Forget it. You did well. Parking Ticket What are you doing? I'm just... heading out to a gig. You almost pulled it off. How could I, with fake blood? But you were good. Keep it. Payment for today's performance. But no more suicide. Being broke isn't worth dying for. You show promise as an actor. I'm used to being broke; that wasn't why I'm confident in my talent. Then why? It wasn't over something noble. Then what, a woman? So guys really do kill themselves over a woman? Shut up. I thought she was mine... but she's marrying someone else. See you. You said you wanted to assume my identity Was that just a ploy to get the woman? Maybe. Yet you laugh at me? See you. I've lost everything. Maybe so, but everybody makes compromises. Iwaki isn't dead - doesn't that make you happy? Who cares about that old fart? No smoking in my car! But you're smoking! Shut up.
