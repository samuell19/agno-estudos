Done with that? Oh, yeah, sorry. Wait. So you know this place used to be part of a secret government experiment? Please don't start with that conspiracy shit again. It's true. The government used to bring psychotic patients out here. Used to bring them out here, take them to the middle of the lake, and tie cinder blocks to their feet and then push them in. And watch them float to the bottom. You mean sink to the bottom? What did I say? You said float to the bottom. You can't float to the bottom of anything. You can only float to the top. Now can I have that? Stop. Give it to me. Babe, I think you have a serious problem. The only problem I have is that every time we smoke, you start rambling about UFOs and government conspiracies. No, it's true. I used to have a friend who knew someone out here. He said they used to give these criminals drugs all the time. And then murder them. And the government and pharmacy companies paid for all of it. Can we talk about something else? That's why they call this place Crazy Lake. They're all out there. You know you're an idiot, right? Sometimes I wonder why I even let you see me naked. It's 'cause we both like tacos. So are we gonna do this? Do what? Yes, please. Wait. Let's go in the tent. I really appreciate what you're doing right now. Just stop talking. Let's go see what they're doing. I got it. What a gentleman. Don't have a suitcase? Are you gonna have enough clothes? Johnny, I'm only planning on wearing bikinis. It's gonna be a good week. Kristen! Will you be honest with me? Sure. Is one of my boobs bigger than the other? Just tell me, I can take it. Maybe a little, but I think that's normal. That's not normal! Let me see yours. No. That's it, I'm not going. What's your deal? It's just every time I'm with Tim, I feel like he's looking for reasons to break up with me. Megan. You don't know what it's like being with guys like him. One second, he's telling me he loves me, the next second, he's telling his friends about Biggie Smalls. You're so lucky you don't have a boyfriend. Thanks. I mean, you totally could if you wanted one. Uh-huh. Can I please just see your boobs? No. Let me see them! No! That's Tim. How much farther, I have to pee. We're really close. I really have to go. It's like two more miles. Can't you just... No, this is happening, pull over. - What? - Pull over, Mark! Babe, pull over. Move! Move, get out! Jesus! She's really fun. Hello? She might be taking a shit. I'm gonna go make sure she didn't pass out. You okay? Scared me! Ready to go? Wait, look at this. What is it? I don't know, maybe it's like a rabbit or raccoon got killed or something. Killed by what? I don't know, Kim. Maybe a coyote. Let's just go. Nobody said anything about coyote! You okay? Yeah. Kristen, do you have any service? I have one bar. Nope, I have no bars. So, Kristen, you excited to meet Corey? Who's Corey? You didn't tell her? - Tell me what? - Nothing. Johnny and Mark's friend. He's gonna be at the cabin. Megan's trying to get you guys to have sex. He's joking. No, you literally said, "I'm going to get them to have sex." Megan. Fine, okay, I said it. But what I meant was I just thought it'd be cool for you to have someone to hang out with this week. It's three couples. I don't want you to be left out. I'll be fine. I was just planning on relaxing and reading a book or something. Let's get one thing straight. You can light candles or read 50 Shades whenever you want, but not this week. Not this week. Okay. Fine. Yay! What do we have here? Oh shit, what's up, my man? Glad you made it, brother. Johnny B. Hood! What's up, man? Hi. Corey. Yeah, you are. Look at that face! Hi, I'm Corey. Hi, I'm Kristen. Hi, I'm Kristen. God, I wish I could live in this moment. I, um, like your smile. Thank you. Is it vintage? What? Is it vintage? Oh. All right, everybody, listen up! I just wanna lay down a few ground rules before we head in. Throw up goes in the toilet, condoms go in the trash, and under no circumstance, will anybody shit in the tub. Talking to you, Tim. You do something seven or eight times, you get a reputation. I'm serious, man. But other than that, this week has no rules. Let's just have some fun and get fucked up! Let's go! Get the key... Come on, man. I'm trying. Um, guys, guys! What do you want, man? I'm trying. Just back off, man. I don't wanna have to hurt you. It's twist. To the left, then the right. Jesus, that was like a frigging horror movie. Who are you, man? Name's Cyrus. What y'all doing up here? My uncle owned the place. He never said nothing about no nephew. You knew him? Manner of speaking. I look after the place ever since he passed. God rest his soul. Well, appreciate the help with the door. Have y'all accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior? I'm a Christian. Not dressed like that you ain't. Babe. It's Cyrus, right? Cyrus, do you know of any clubs around here that do bottle service? Cool. Very cool. Y'all just stay on property. And there won't be no trouble. I'm gonna be by tomorrow to fix some things out back. Thanks again for the door. Love you, dog. Stay black, homie. I call best room. Oh, hell no, bitch. Babe! Any one but the master! Isn't this place great? You okay? Yeah. What's wrong? Are you sure this is a good idea? Yeah, this place is awesome. That guy just creeped me out and we're in some stranger's cabin. Jules, he's not a stranger, and the cabin was a gift. I promise nothing bad is gonna happen this week. Okay? It's gonna be great. Come on. I guess this is the only one. Yeah. Why don't you take it and I'll stay on the couch. No, no, no, no, it's fine. I can sleep on the couch. Don't be crazy, just take it. I'll stay on the couch. Okay? Uh, well, we can share it. Serious? Yeah. Swap off each night on the couch. Oh, I thought you meant like... We'll work it out. Um, I'll see you later. See ya. Hey, can you help me with this? Yeah. Kim, I'm trying. Just not happening. Think you'll have to go without it. Nice try. I'm gonna go lay out in the sun. You don't wanna hang out over here? Oh, you want me to hang out over here? - Hell yeah. - Yeah? Oh, yes. You wanna have a little fun? - You know it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Aw, too bad, babe. I don't think so. Bye. Woman, you the devil! Hey! Who wants to slip into something a little more comfortable? What's that? - Camera. - Ooh, take my picture? You take it? Nah, it's video. Asshole. Lucky it's waterproof. You wanna get naked? I'll make you famous. I'm okay. Okay. Think I'm gonna go down there. See what's happening. Take your time. Mike? What's wrong with you? There's somebody down there! - What? - I saw somebody down there! Something or someone? A person, I saw a person down there, let's go! I'm gonna... What, no, Katie, come... I'll be right back! No, Katie! Katie! Katie! Come on. 9-1-1, what is the address of your emergency? Fuck! All right, girls, you're gonna judge who has the best slide, and losers go in the lake. Hold this, babe. Don't go yet. Babe, can you hold this? Yeah. Hey. Nice dick. Thanks. All right, I'll go first. - Six. - Six. Go, Corey! Go, Corey! - Three. - Five. Kristen. Come on, baby! Three. Aw, come on! Wait, here's the last part. - Fuck! - What happened, man? God damnit, something on the ground cut me. Where? The fuck is that? Barbwire. Babe, you're a nurse. What should he do? Really, I'm a dental hygienist. We need to put pressure on this. Megan, go inside the house, get a towel or a rag. Kim, go with her, see if you can find a first-aid kit. Oh shit, look, it's Dr. Quinn. Dude, fuck off! Do I need stitches? I don't know. We gotta get this cleaned up first. Here. Just gonna use this to apply pressure, all right? Dude, why the fuck is there barbwire - on the ground? - I don't know, man! Kim, did you find a first-aid kit? No, I couldn't find one. Is he gonna be okay? Corey, grab me that bottle of vodka. - Okay. - No! Listen, we have to get the dirt and bacteria out before it gets infected. - Here. - I don't want it! I don't want it! Babe, hand me your phone, I gotta record this. Please, just take me to a hospital. No, we have to get it cleaned now. No, don't. Someone grab his arms? No. No! Worldstar! No, no, no, no, no! How could you do this to me? You knew what time we had to be there! Do not put this on me! You're the one that wanted to wait to put gas in, and now we're stuck in the middle of fucking nowhere! It's fine, all right? Just calm down. Don't tell me what to do, bitch. You know what? Fuck you, Farrah! Where are you going? Well, there have to be some houses around here somewhere, so I'm going to go and find help. You stay in the bloody car if you want to! Fine! Lacey, wait! Lacey, wait! Bitch asked me to drive and then she wants to give me shit. Lacey! Just stay with the car, Farrah! Lacey, turn around! What do you want? Lacey, please! What? No, no, no, please, please, please. So, how's the foot? It hurts. You know, technically, you did lose. Thanks, man. So, anybody down for some poker? I guess. I'm sorry, who's down for some strip poker? Definitely! All right, things are starting to get interesting. Kim. Kim? Kim! - What? - It's you. Oh. Whatever, I'm out. All right, looks like it's just Corey and Megan. Fellas, can we have a little powwow for a second? Hey, no cheating. Babe, it's not cheating. It's coaching. All right, so it's not good. What do you have? Pair of eights. Goddamn! Um, them some sweet ass cards though. You gotta do it. Yeah, man, I really wanna see Megan's boobs. My bad. Nah, it's cool. They're really nice. All right. - Let's do it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Cool, you guys ready? - Not yet. - All right, well, hurry up. I'll get another beer. Me too. Come on. Talk to you for a second? What's up, man? Can I give you some advice? - Okay. - All right. As you're probably aware, very good chance that everyone in this room is gonna see your dick tonight. Yeah, I know. Okay, and it's no secret that you got a little candy crush on Kristen. Depending on how this goes, it could be very good or it could be really bad. Wait, what? Look, Corey, I've never seen your penis, sure's got a lot going for it, I just wanna make sure that when you do present it, you're showing people the best of what you have to offer. So you're saying I should get a boner... Hey-oh! Keep it down, motormouth. Look, kid, nobody's talking about a boner here. Okay, I'm talking about a happy middle ground. Got a little bit of gas in the tank, but you're not slamming your foot down on the pedal. Okay. All right, I think I understand what you're saying. But I don't know how to do that. Corey, Corey, Corey. Those girls are hot, right? Possibly unrealistically hot. All you gotta do is give a quick glance. Get the party started. Whatever you do, don't stare. You don't need a noise complaint. Understand? Yep. Right. That's my boy. Go out there and put your best dick forward. Ladies, finally ready? Uh, duh. Let's start with Corey. What do you wanna do? I'm in. Okay. Megan, what do you wanna do? I'm in. All right, moment of truth. Corey. Pair of eights. Megan? Pair of fives. Come on, babe, no hands. Okay. What was that? Was that the door? That's what it sounded like. Someone gonna get that? I'll go check it out. It's probably just carolers. Come on, come on, come on, come on, please open. Who is it? And behind door number one! Guys! There's no one even here. What's the matter? Outside, I saw someone out the window. - Where? - Out there! Everyone, stay here. What are you doing? Mark, don't! What's going on? Someone's outside! What's that? It's fucked up. Wasn't there when we got here. Okay, this ends now. Wait, man, I'll come with. No. Stay here. All right, I'm gonna take a piss. Hello? Someone out here? What exactly did you see? I don't know, Johnny, but I saw someone outside! What, you don't believe me? - Huh? - No, it's okay. We believe you. I bet that was that creepy guy. Megan, why would a lonely old man wanna watch a bunch of young, hot girls strip? Do you think before you talk? What was that? Did you shut the door? Yeah. Did you lock it? Nuh-uh. Corey, is that you? Hey, are you okay? Hello? - What? - Did you open the front door? No, dude, I took a piss inside. But did you open the door? No, dude, I took a piss inside. Is there a problem? No, it's okay. We just thought we heard the front door open, and we wanted to know if it was you. We did hear the front door open. Well, it wasn't me. It's all right, man. I'll check it out. Yeah, man, hobble on over there and see what it was. Sit down, man, I'll check it out. No, Corey, wait! What? Figured, uh, since I was just out there, came back, I got a little toy, uh, I'm good for a little bit. No? Don't worry about it, man. It's probably just Mark. What? I guarantee he doesn't come back with a gift. So, who's up for another round? Hey, Mark, you out here, man? Mark! Mark, is that you? Mark. What are you doing? I was looking for you. What's that? I don't know, I found it in the crate. You okay, man? No, man. I just got out of the cold ass lake and I get back here to find you snooping around in my family's shit. Dude, I think you need to back up because I was looking for you. And then I heard a noise and that's why I came in here. You were looking for me, huh? Did you expect to find me in that crate? Maybe in that folder? - Well, no, but I... - Look, I don't know you that well, man. But shit like this isn't going to fly if you wanna hang with us this week. Put it back. Put it back. This is supposed to be a fun week and we don't need anymore weird shit scaring the girls. Fine. There they are. So was it that guy? No, I don't know, um... Mark, did you go swimming? No, I mean, I did, but I know tonight's been crazy, but we checked outside, no one's out there, so I think it's best if we just call it a night. Well, this has been fun. Hopefully, my foot doesn't fall off in the middle of my sleep. Hey, Mark. Great party. Hey, Tim. Go fuck yourself. Oh, you want trouble, huh, guy? Hey. Are you okay? Fine. What's wrong, you've been acting pissed off since you got back here. Nothing. Mark, talk to me. You know, I shouldn't have invited him. Invited who? Tim? No. Corey. What's wrong with Corey? You don't get a weird vibe from that kid? I mean, I barely know him, but I thought he was cool. He seems all right. Kristen seems to like him. Nah, something weird's happening. I don't trust him. What? I wasn't gonna say anything, but when you went to go check outside, he went to the bathroom. I could've sworn I heard the front door close. What, when did you plan on telling me this, Jules? I didn't think about it! Why are you getting mad at me? Sorry, it's just... It's not how I wanted things to go. Come here. It's not your job to make sure everyone has fun. We can have our own fun. You smell like shit. Oh, yeah, I was, um, in the lake. I know, why exactly? Just gonna get in the shower. How about a bath? What are you doing? Brushing my teeth? Where's Corey? I think he's in the living room. You like him, right? Yeah, he's cute. So? Kristen, I know his type. He's not gonna make the first move. You have to be the one to initiate. What am I supposed to do? Well, for starters, stop looking like you're dressing up for a middle school slumber party. These are my pajamas. No. These are pajamas. I don't look like that. Are you kidding, Kristen? You have a banging body. Come here. Why? Ow! Ow. And these... This has to go. Are you done? What do you have on under there? - What? - I wanna know what - you're wearing under these. - What? Stop. What are you doing? What is it? Nothing, okay? Don't have anything. You happy now? Nice. Okay, I think you're ready. Whatever. Thank you, I guess. Hey, one last thing. What? What are you doing? Shh. Just go with it. Now you're ready. See? This is nice. Mark. Mark. What? What are you thinking about? Nothing. Come here. What the hell, man? - Tim! - Worldstar! Get out of here, man. Okay, okay. I'll go in like 30 minutes. No, go to bed now. All right, let's all go to bed. Come on now, get out of the tub. I don't think so. Well, at least we have the video. That's it. Hey. What you doing? Um, cutting an apple. You wanna slice? Sure. Thanks. It's really good. Yeah. It looks like you really enjoyed that. So, are you having fun? Yeah, I mean, it's been crazier than I thought, but I'm having fun. You? Oh. Yeah. Cool. Well, um, couch is calling my name. Uh, well, I actually wanted to talk to you about that. Oh, no, it's cool. You know, we don't have to switch. You can just stay there. Well, I mean, it's a really big bed. We could just share it. Yeah? Like one of us on the covers, the other one on top. Or we could put like pillows between us. Yeah. No, um... Those are really good ideas. Look, I don't want you to get the wrong idea about me. What's what? I mean, I think you're cool and, um, I just don't want to make you uncomfortable. I'm not. Damn, that's some serious Notebook shit, man. Nobody's gonna wanna see that. Come on, man. Goodnight, Tim. All right, man. Build to that house. Night, dude. Night, guys. Goodnight, everyone! Kristen, can I borrow your blow dryer? Oh. Oh! I'm just gonna... Mark. What are you doing? Beautiful out here, right? Yeah. Are you coming inside? In a second. There's some eggs left if you're hungry. Okay. It's cold. I'm gonna go inside. Hey. I love you. I love you too. Yeah, man, but that's good to hear. It was a lot of fun. Things turned out, you know, unexpectedly. Yeah, I don't know though. I think she might be the one. So, Corey, how'd you sleep last night? Good. Really? Because I didn't. Sounded like a goddamn Mariah Carey concert next door. What's going on? Nothing, Mark, you do own shirts, right? I'm on vacation, bitch. So, what are we doing today? You should go for a run. I don't know about you guys, but I'm gonna take my lady on a little nature hike. Gonna get in touch with where the wild things are. Then what are we gonna do? You guys wanna go fishing? I saw they have some poles over there. Oh, yeah? Where'd you see that? In one of the bedroom closets. Oh, really? So now you're just going through everything, huh? Okay, this seems fun. Babe, you wanna get going? Yeah. Mark. Mark. Let's go get something to eat. Come on. - Yeah. - Let's go. What was that all about, bro? I don't know, man. I don't know. Babe, wait up. Well, hurry up. What's the hurry? Is it me or has Mark turned into a real psycho? I think he might be juicing. Uh, no. He was drinking coffee. God, that's cute. You're lucky you're really hot. Wait, do you not even want me to go with you? Because you do know you can go by yourself. Megan. You know I want you to come with me. You know I've been trying to get some alone time with you. Come on, dumb-dumb. So what happens now? Now we just wait. Wait for what? The fish. Oh. For how long? As long as it takes. Well, I'm bored. You wanna hold my pole? No, Johnny, I don't wanna hold your pole. Babe. Uh oh. Nah, man, she's cool. You should cast over there. Over there? All right. You get something? I'm stuck on something. Let me see. Probably just stuck on some weeds. There we go. Something's on the line. What is that? Is that a shirt? Oh, shit. Here. Looks like somebody went skinny-dipping. Dude, that's a hospital gown. That's really weird. Why would there be... Dude, can I tell you something? Yeah, what's up? All right, so last night when I was looking for Mark... - Jesus Christ! - What the fuck man! Hey, y'all doing some fishing? Yeah. Catch anything good? Nah, man, this lake sucks. All we got is some shitty hospital gown. Let me see that. Y'all gonna keep doing some fishing? Nah, man. - We're good. - Yeah. Let's go back to the house. Looks like somebody was out here camping. You think they're still here? No, I don't see any tents. Babe, why don't we ever go camping? Meg, you know I only like you in the kitchen and the bedroom. You know, I'm getting really tired of your shit. I know you think you're funny, but behind all your jokes, there's some truth. If you think I'm only good for sex, then maybe we shouldn't be together. Okay, okay. I was just having fun. You know how I feel about you. Yeah? How's that? I love you? You what? I love you? Oh my god, I knew it! I can't wait till we move in together, and start a life, and have babies, and... Ah, yeah, yeah. Let's just enjoy the moment. Oh! Okay. Ooh, hey now! Baby, I love you. Uh-huh. I said I love you. Tim. What? Did you not hear what I said? I love you too. Hold on, hold on. Okay, go. Worldstar! Oh, shit! Going somewhere? Pack your things, Kim. Where are we going? We're going home. There's some crazy shit going on and we need to get outta here. You're scared, Johnny? Kim, it's not a joke. I don't know what this place is or why Mark brought us out here. All that I know is I'm the only black dude and I'm not sticking around to see what happens next. Well, I'm having fun. Fine. So you're just gonna walk home? Go back inside. Where are you going? Go find Tim and Megan. Take Tim's car and get outta here. What? No. Johnny, are you serious? Come on, Kim. That guy, my foot, stuff that happened last night, what more do you need? Look, if you wanna stay, that's fine. Go back to the cabin. Wait, baby. I'm sorry, okay? Come on. Be careful. You sure you wanna do that? I am. I win. You cheated! How did I cheat? You guys seen Johnny or Kim? Uh, no, why? They're not in their room? No. Maybe they went for a hike like Tim and Megan did. What's going on here? Just playing a game. Where'd you get it? - What? - Where'd you find it? I... I found it in one of the rooms. Really? Here, taste this. Let's go to the bedroom. Come on. You wanna play again? Can I tell you something? What's that? So last night when everything was happening... Megan! Tim! Megan! Tim! Johnny, I don't know. They couldn't have gone too far. Let's keep going. Wait. Did you hear that? Hear what? What was that? Megan! Megan! Kim, wait! Oh no! We have to go! What's going on? Run! Oh, shit! Johnny! Johnny, come on! I'm sorry. What? It's just over here. Wait. What? Okay. Where is it? Where's what? Mark. What are you guys doing in here? What's with the bat? Oh, I just wanted to see if anyone was up for a little baseball. Looking for something? Yeah, where's the crate that was here? What crate? The crate with the stuffed animal. I don't know what you're talking about. Are you serious, dude? Corey? No, I swear it was here. Sounds like a sad excuse to get you alone. Seems pretty pathetic if you ask me. No, that, that's not... Whatever. Where do you think you're going? What is this? Corey, Corey, Corey. You just couldn't! Leave it! Alone! Mark! What is the matter with you? Don't worry. You're next. Please don't kill me. Please, I just wanna go home! I won't tell anybody. Just please, I don't wanna die! This is not how I wanted things to go. Why are you doing this? Julia, sweetheart. Why don't you try something that you've never done before? And shut the fuck up! Mark, this isn't funny. We didn't do anything wrong. You. I should've never invited you. You just had to go and fuck things up by getting into things you shouldn't have. What are you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about! I'm talking about this! All the patients that got killed out here! I don't even know what those are. You don't know what they are. Well, did you see this one? No. This is my cousin. He used to live out here with my uncle. When my uncle died, they couldn't find him. But now, I'm starting to think maybe he's still out here. And I can't be babysitting your nosy asses while I try to find him! What? Someone's outside. It's probably just Tim and Johnny wanting to join the party. I'll go grab them. Don't you fucking move! Hey, guys. Wait! His car keys! Come on, keys, keys, keys. Henry? Henry, it's you. It's me, your cousin Mark. Remember me? It's okay. It's okay. Here, take this. Everything's gonna be fine. We're gonna take you some place safe, okay? Here. It's okay. I promise. Everything is gonna be fine. We're gonna take you some place safe. It's okay. - No! - What are you doing? Don't even think about, just stop! Why did you make me do that? You always ruined everything! No! What's the matter with you? I guess crazy just runs in the family. Never liked that kid. You ready? Everything is gonna be fine. Here. Okay? Let's do this. Henry. Tim! Tim! Where the fuck are the keys? Where the fuck are the keys? No, no! Stay back! Just stay back! I'm just gonna get in the car and go. No don't do that! You all right? No. He killed them. He killed them all. Well, it's over now. All right. All right. You're safe. Calm down. All right? Phone back at my house. Go there, we'll call the police, all right? Thank you. Come on. So your friends, you, uh, you sure they're... Yeah. That's a damn shame. That's a shame, darling. Do you know why he did it? No. Well, I told him I'd seen you first. What? But I guess they don't call it Crazy Lake for nothing, right? Where's your house? Darling, if you weren't scared before, you should be now. Please, no.
