(tense music) - Daddy? Wake up! - AH!! - Mommy told me to come wake you up. The guests are coming today. - Excuse me, darling. How are you feeling? - I had the dream again. - Again? But your heart... - The same one. The same way. â™ª (honking) - Ahh, the first of the victims has arrived. - Drinking already, Gerald? - It makes the day go faster, sister darling. An enormous advantage when one has guests like yours for the weekend. - Mark! - Hello, Nicky! How are you? - We'll hangout all the time! - Why haven't I seen you lately? - I don't get into town very often. It's been about a year, hasn't it? - How's Edmund? - I think a little more nervous than the usual. He's been working awfully hard, but this weekend with such good friends here, I'm sure it should help him to relax. - Hello, Edmund. I hope you don't mind me screwing up the scenery. - Of course not, Mark. You're the scenery. - Yes. - Thanks a lot, pal. - And if you don't behave, we're gonna put you in the attic under lock and key, won't we, Edmund? - That sounds like fun. Incidentally, who is the entertainment this weekend? - Oh, well-- - Besides me, now. - Yes, of course, darling. Serge and Eunice are coming, and Charlie Hughes, one of Edmund's old business contacts, and his wife is-- - Jesus! - Don't eat that crap. You're getting fat. - Why don't you shut up? I've got a ten. - Your cigar, Charlie. - Shut up. Smoke it. - You're all set, mister. Nine dollars and 23 cents. - Less 25 cents for your machine which doesn't work. That makes 8,98-- - Give me 35 cents, Charlie. - I can't take a credit card. - Why? - They're having a counterfeit investigation. - Listen, idiot, this is a VIP card. - Look, Jack-- - Wait a minute. Charles Hughes, not Jack. Did I say my name was Jack? - Jack, I don't particularly like being called an idiot. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. My name is not Jack. It's Charles Hughes. - I don't care if your name is Rockefeller. - No, not Rockefeller. Hughes. Charles Hughes. Do you know what that means? You see that sign up there? I own 2% of that sign. That sign licenses you to sell gasoline. On Monday morning, that sign no longer licenses you to sell gasoline, because I own 2% of that sign, which means I own 2% of you. I don't want my 2% of you, so I'm getting rid of it now. Do you understand what I mean? I hope you do, because there's a great big gasoline station down the road selling great big gas to great big people. Maybe you can get a job there fixing flats. Understand? - Nine dollars and 23 cents cash. - Here's 10, big shot. Keep the change, because you're gonna need it. Remember the name? Hughes. - Charles Hughes. Mr. Hughes? Screw you. - Mother-- Can we go? - Let's get out of here. Get in the car, let's get out of here. - You're just like a little brat! - God, shut up, will you? Get in the car. - Charlie! (tires screeching) - You stupid son of a bitch! (yelling at the same time) (peaceful music) (birds chirping) - How's the new book coming, Edmund? - It's a children's story. - Oh. A fairy tale? - Not quite. It's a horror story. - Oh. - I adore fantasy. - Hope to read it. - Well, it's, uh... I don't have an ending yet. - Endings are simple. Your characters should either all perish or live happily ever after. - You're quite right. We'll lunch in half an hour by the lake. I'll see you then. - Hey, here it comes! Here it comes! - Drown, you bitch. - Local news today: the Joliet Psychiatric Institute reports the escape of three inmates, one of whom, Jezebel Joyce, achieved notoriety several years ago as the first female professor of philosophy at Harvard University. In 1969, she was convicted of the widely publicized knife murder of one of her students. Description of the other two escapees is not yet available. The three should be considered extremely dangerous, but police officials expect a recapture shortly. Weather tonight: thunder, possible showers-- (barking) - Aziz! Aziz! - Hey, chief. Come here. Hungry? - No. - Hey, tell me, what do you do around here for action? - Sometimes we sail, dance, go to the movies. - Oh yeah? Who's "we"? - Oh, my friends from school. - Yeah? Hey, you got nice arms. Look at those muscles, wow! - Leave the poor thing alone, Charlie. She's not your type. - What do you mean, she's not my type? Are you kidding? I can grow a beard, I can smoke pot, I can do the joogoo-booloo-booloo! - Save it for the bedroom. - What's everybody so uptight about? What do you do around here besides draw pictures? - Why don't you take a nice, long walk in the woods? (dramatic music) - Oh, thank you, Betsy. No, put them in the pantry. - Sure. Should I make up any of the other rooms? - No, the guests are all here now. - Oh, I'll be able to stay a little later tonight. Mom's taken the car into Joliet. - Oh, fine. Get the rest of the plates, Betsy. - Sure. (chopping) - Daddy! Aziz's run after something in the woods. (dramatic music) - He'll be back. - No, he won't! Please go find him! Please. Please! - Alright. No, you stay here. Play with Uncle Charlie. - Yeah, sure, kid. Come on, let's play catch. Ready? (He laughs.) (birds chirping) - Aziz? Aziz! (loud beating) (drumming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (knocking) (knocking) - Who is it? Who is it? Jason! (birds chirping) (drumming) (insects buzzing) (dramatic music) - Libya! What do you mean, what-- It's a country in North Af-- Is this the overseas operator? Libya! It's a country in North Africa! That's south of the North Pole! That's right. Intellectual cripples. - Go back to your room, Mark. Charlie's coming. I'd hate to see your pink little bottoms hiding in the closet. - How does it feel when Charlie touches you? - He doesn't. We do it by phone. - Is it that little crinkling sound of paper, like dollar bills? - When you say it, it sounds nice. - Or do you just stare at the ceiling? - And my ceiling says "Until death do us part", just in case I forget. - Ha! You think you're pretty tough, don't you? - Why don't you go downstairs, Mark, and talk to Charlie about stocks and bonds? You know how he values your masculine opinion. - I might just go downstairs and talk to Charlie about you. - Me? - You. - Alright. As long as I don't have to wait long with Betsy the maid. - Tonight? - I'll come to your room when Charlie's asleep. - OK. As a matter of fact, I've got something special in store for you tonight. - So do I. - Ciao. Hi there. - Hello. - Yeah. Yeah, OK. - Well, Charlie, did you make a deal? - No, as a matter of fact, the deal fell through. - Who was it who said it? Jesus? "Money is the root of all evil". Isn't that the truth? - You know, Frost, the one thing I never liked about you is the fact that you always looked down at me like I was some kind of an insect. Why? Because I made millions. But you love money as much as I do. The trouble is you don't know how to make it. All you know how to make is other men's wives and silly teenagers. And you know, I got my doubts about that. You're a failure, Frost. Small time. Very small time. - Don't be a bad loser, Charlie. - No, I just wanted to get that off my chest. - Good. Prevents cancer. (chuckling) - Just think, right now I could be in California. Spanish mansion, sauna, swimming pool, six or seven Mexican servants running around, nine-ten little bimbos... - Yes, it was so good of you to come. - I like these people! I mean, a little old fashioned, but, uh, OK. You're OK too, Kahn. I like your head. - Thank you. I like yours too, Charlie. - What I like about you is, even though you got a title, you're not a snob, you know what I mean? I like that. I like that deal on the island too. What was the name of it? - San Leon, yes. A lovely island, filled with beaches, blue marble mines, and little brown berry... - Yeah? Tell you what. You know what I'd like? I'd like to put in 50 grand in that. Just fund money, you know what I mean? - Well, yes... yes, I-- - And don't think I don't mean it. I don't screw around with accounts and lawyers and all that type of stuff. I work on instinct. - I'm sure. - We're a dying breed, Kahn. - Mrs. Blackstone? - Yes? - I guess Mom's stuck in Joliet tonight. I can get a ride out on the road. - You want the money, right? - I... - Kahn, there's nothing to be ashamed of! We all got our little weaknesses. I mean, mine's women. - Charlie, what the hell are you doing? - Don't worry, baby, there's more where this came from. We haven't killed the goose yet. - Charlie! Couldn't we do this in another room? - Are you serious? I can't really take this, my friend. - Last chance, Kahn. - Thank you. (chuckling) (dramatic music) - Ha! Well, bravo, Charles, you did it again. Let's all toast to the dollar bill. (glass breaking) - Damn. Sorry, darling. Excuse me. I'll join you all later. Serge, I'd like you to join me in a few minutes in the study. It's important. - I don't know about you people; I'll have a little brandy. How about you, sweetheart? - No, no, thank you, I... think I'll retire early tonight. - Come on, it's bedtime for you, young man. What's the matter? - I want Aziz back. (sighing) - You know my wife. She takes a long time to get to sleep. Every Saturday night now, she... she has a little talk with her dear departed, long lamented late husband Arris. - Serge, please. Excuse me. - Well, me too. Nicole, I'll meet you out on the patio at 9. - Oh, yes. Yes, Mark. - Don't... let... the bedbugs bite. (crickets chirping) (tense music) (distant howling) (howling) (screaming) (tense music) - No... Please. I'll do anything. I won't say. Please. Please don't hurt me. (heavy breathing) - Are you scared? - Scared of what? - I don't know. You look scared. - I'm scared of something in me. - What does that mean? - It means... I love you. I love you as much as Mommy. - You do? - Oh yes. I love you. Sleep. (door closing) (wind gushing) (light knocks) (wind whistling) (tense music) (tense music) - Hey, it's getting cold in here. - Oh, uh, Gerald, start a fire in the living room. - Yeah, go do something for a change. Go ahead. Wait a minute. - What? - I spoke to Eddie this afternoon. What's the matter? - Uh, coffee-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, wait a minute. I'll bring the coffee in the living room. Can I do anything? - You know. Jase? Jase? What are you doing down there? What's the matter? - I'm scared. - Scared? Scared of what, darling? - I'm scared of Daddy. - Something terrible is happening to me. - What, Edmund? - Oh, if I could only tell you. It's as if... it's as if I'm dreaming everything. You, me, us, this whole weekend... I've seen it before. - You say you've dreamt what's happening now? - Yes. I don't know. (sighing) I see this house... A group of friends come to this house for the weekend, and then three strangers appear. I don't know who they are or where they come from. But they're frightening. I sensed it all beginning to happen again this morning when Jason came in to wake me before you arrived, but it wasn't until I went to look for Aziz in the woods that I was sure. I find the dog hanging from a tree in the woods, dead. - My God. - And then a young girl is killed, a teenager. - That should relieve you, no? There are no teenagers here. The poor dog may be coincidence. - It would've been, Serge, it would've been, until Nicole went to the window at dinner and... - And what? - And when she opened it, a face appeared. - A face? Is that why you broke your glass? - The face of something... I invented. - What do you mean? - The drawings, the sketches. The face. I drew him myself before I ever saw him. Look. (dramatic music) - Arris... I know you're upset because I haven't talked to you for so long, but these last few weeks, I've been so depressed after what the doctor said. Arris, I can't have any more sugar. Ha, ha, ha! You always teased me about that, didn't you? But I can learn to live without sweets. I'm a big girl now. Arris... the doctor also said I was getting old. Oh, he didn't say it that way, but that's what he meant. I know, I can tell. Old age doesn't bother me too much as long as you're there. You'll always be there, Arris, won't you? - Yes, Eunice. Don't look at me. - Arris? - You're in my hands now. Though they cannot touch you, my hands feel you. They know you. Someone is in the room with you now, Eunice. He is behind you. When you look at him, I don't want you to be afraid, because he is a friend who will bring us together again. He bears an ointment, a magic ointment that will bring you eternal youth. - Oh, Arris... Arris, I don't think I ever... I should've told you about Serge. He's a lovely gentleman. I married him. I-- - Eunice, look into the mirror. Look into it now, or else you'll lose me. Do you see me? Yes. Yes, you do. (soft music) It was the night we met. It was warm. It was spring. Remember? (dancing music) Now turn around, Eunice. Take the gift. My gift. And come back with me. - Forgive me. Make him forgive me for marrying someone else. I want so to be with him again. I so want to be with him. - He forgives you, Eunice. And he sends his secrets. Secrets that will moisten your skin. Remove the wrinkle of age. Revive the luster in your look. And recreate the fragrance of your limbs. All for him. You'll be young again, Eunice. Young. Now lie down. Wait for him. He comes. - Mikki? It's about time, I was falling asleep. - Shh... - Alright, you wanna play games? - Don't touch. - OK. That's a nice perfume. What is it? - I'll tell you when it's time, my love. - So mysterious tonight. - Come here, Mark. (chuckling) - You know, this is... It's getting dull. (laughing) (footsteps) Who's that? - Just the wind picking at the chimney, Charles. (light knocks) - Do you hear that? (footsteps) - Pigeon? - With feet like that? - Maybe it's an eagle. It's your move, Char-- - Shh! (footsteps) (footsteps) Wait a minute. Don't tell me you didn't hear that. Man, this is spooky. What am I doing here? I should be in California. (dramatic music) Christ! There was someone at that window. - Maybe it's one of your dead business partners come back to haunt-- - Why don't you shut up? - Have you seen Edmund? - Ha, ha, ha! - Is this some kind of a joke? - Enjoy it while-- - Who are you? (dramatic music) (groaning) (gasping) - You should go back to school, creep. - Impossible. I've already been-- (banging on door) - Nicole! - Do something! - AH!! (banging on door) Look, you can't come... You can't go breaking into people's houses like that. Who are you? What do you want? Alright, that's the way you want it? Come on, kid, let's take him! Come on! - He kinda looks like he knows what he's doing. (screaming) Jesus! - Edmund! (screaming) - Get back! (screaming) (gunshots) (moaning in pain) - Stop! - Stupid... bastard. (screaming) - Shoot. Go ahead, shoot. (screaming) - Don't ask us who we are or where we come from. We are without beginning or end. And our purpose, our only purpose, is death. You will do as you're told, though nothing will make sense. Some of you will seek an answer in what follows, and some of you will find it. But for the others, there will be darkness, damnation and a meaningless death. Mark, Eunice and Gerald... ...are already on their way to that darkness. Now, one after the other, the rest of you will die, and at dawn tomorrow, only one of you will be left. Just one. - You're... you're not gonna get away with this! - Silence! I say silence! That's it. I am old and I am ugly, but remember, my race was born inside your belly. We have no children, but as we breed inside of you, we know you. We know your secrets. We read your mind. Don't try to escape and don't try to trick me, or otherwise, I will make your death more painful. Now, we will play a little game. The game is fun for the young, but painful for the old. It will match each of you against the other in a race around the house, supervised by my poor mute friend Jackal. Five times you will make the circle until the weakest of you cross the finishing line last. He or she will be executed. - Oh God. - God will not help you now. Only your lungs and your legs will. I am of a race older than God, and I have no place in him and I have no pity for you. Only contempt. Prepare! - Come, my friends. It would be a pleasure to watch the trains go by were we not tied to the tracks, but we have no choice. With all our civilization, we must still learn to accept that nature holds no special account of our disasters. In any way, you have little to fear. I'm the oldest and the weakest among you. - Alright, don't argue, they're crazy. - Run. I'll be behind you. We can't lose. - On your marks! Run! - Nicole! - I've sinned, God. I wanted the wrong things. I never wanted a child, God, never. It was always myself I thought of first. I'm old, I'm ugly and... vain, selfish. Ashamed. I don't want anything from you, nothing but to be alone with my Arris forever. Please understand that, God, please understand. - Do you think he cares about your prayers? Do you think he forgives you because you kneel there, begging and whining and forever confessing your sordid little sin? Do you think he does not see through you? - I know. I know it's true. - You ugly women... he hates you! - Punish me. Please, punish me. - (Arris' voice): You punish yourself, Eunice. Lift your head. (screaming) Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, all is vanished. (dancing music) (sobbing) (gasping) - Oh! - Mik... Mikki! - Get in. - But... but... - Get in! We made it! God, we made it! - But Jason is still in there! - He's safe. We'll get some help. Damn! - But what about the others? - Why save their ass? Forget them. No, stay here! - I won't. - You will! - No, I won't! - Goddamn it, you will! The window! Close the window! (screaming) Come! Let's get out of here! We gotta get back in the race! (screaming) Hurry! We're behind! - Oh, Mikki, it hurts! - I can't hold you, you're too heavy! Why should I do anything for you? You didn't wait for me when you were ahead! - I was gonna wait! You don't think I'd leave you! - I know! - I gave you everything! You're gonna die with me! I gave you a house, I gave you clothes! - You make me sick! They're gonna win! Take back your selfish hands! I hate you! - No! Mikki! Mikki! (panting) - My God... No... (gasping) - Ah!! (creaking) - Let me go! Let me go! Ah! You're smart. I'll give you a million dollars. A million! I got it! Oh yes, I got it. I'll make it out to you. One million. What's your name? That's alright, you can fill it in yourself. Hey, I got it! Yes, get him! Look! (indistinct) American Express, Buyers Club... I got it! Kill the rest of them. Let me go, OK? Please? (laughing) What'd you do that for?? Hey! What are your names? You're quiet, but you're smart, I can tell. You're bright. Me and you will be a team. Let's fly. Brazil, Mexico... (screams) You're not listening to me! You can't talk. Shock treatments! No money can buy this. I know a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills who can fix that up. A million dollars! You'll look great! I'll get you women! Hundreds of big black ones! Or white ones! I'll leave that to your liking. I'll get anything you want! Anything! Just break that midget's leg! Break his leg! - Enough. Kill him. (dramatic music) (laughing) - Ah! No! Nooooo!! Nooo! No! No! (cracking) (snapping) - Ah! (moaning) (laughing) - So, my little Spider... Idiot! (running footsteps) Get her. (honking) - Help me! Help me, please! (screaming) - How can you read at a time like this? - Why not? The answer to our fears lies not in physical force but in knowing who these people are. - Maniacs, psychotics, killers, that's what they are! Without rhyme or reason! Does that answer your question? (sighing) It's up to Mikki now, not us. - Maybe. Maybe not. Maniacs, as you call them, have a reputation for telling the truth. Like children. Like old men who babble too much. You know, there was once a legendary prince, quite popular in French history. He lived 900 years ago and was called Louis the Cruel. He was a dwarf. - So what does that mean? - He would imprison his enemies in little cages in his dungeons, cages so small the poor souls couldn't even stand upright. They were shut off from the light, going slowly blind, their bodies taking on the crippled form of Louis himself. - Get to the point, will you? - This prince had become so famous for his malice that before long, the fearing multitude had invented a rather idiosyncratic name for him. - What, for God's sake? - L'AraignÃ©e. The Spider. - You're going far on a limb, aren't you? - One could say that. And one would be hard put to trace the lineage of the one they call "The Jackal". He seems to be a stereotype of our nightmares, the only frightening thing being that these stereotypes do exist. As a matter of fact, Jackal could be a variation on the Russian word... (word in Russian) ...which means executioner. - I've never heard of a black Russian executioner. - The Middle Ages, you see, bred a sort of pageantry. In Russia, at one epoch, the torturers were imported from the Arab slave marts of Madagascar and the West African coast, because black skin, to their naÃ¯ve minds, was thought to be horrifying. They were the last resort to make the guilty confess and the condemned repent. And curiously, many of them were mute, having had their tongues removed, no doubt to prevent them from telling what they saw. - You're... ah, shit! You're out of your mind. They're maniacs. Maybe they've staged all this to look like that, but they're maniacs just the same. Maybe they've escaped from that damned institution down in Joliet, but it's not supernatural! It can't be! Anyway, how can you explain that... that cold-blooded creature, that Queen of Evil? - The most interesting of them all. I think she is the dark mother goddess of the Hindu faith, Kali, the giver and the destroyer of life. In metaphor, her body's lithe and beautiful, her breasts big with milk, but around her neck, she wears a wreath of severed heads, and in her hands, she holds the bodies of little children she's about to devour. In her name, thousands of years ago, children were sacrificed by throwing them into the flames. To us, of the Western world, brought up in the image of the Virgin Mary, it is difficult to believe in a mother contaminated by this dark principle. But in truth, she is the majestic embodiment of our desires and thoughts. The alluring, eternal female of our soul: the mother, and equally so, the dark lady of the world. - My God, Serge! You too. This evening has made you mad. My only friend. You have deserted me too. - Edmund, you are the Faust who brought her into being, not I. This is your evening. The proof is that you have seen these beings before in your recurring nightmare and in your drawings. It is you who have created these creatures. - You fancy yourself superior to me, but I'll deal with you later. You. Come here. - Go with him, Edmund. Do not fear his harm. - Silence! (tense music) - Jackal. This is your last chance, Mikki. Kill him, and you go free. (drumming) - Mikki! (grunting in pain) Ow! (Mikki screams.) - Ah! (screaming) (moaning in pain) - Kill her. (gasping) (death rattle) - Dead. At last. (creaking) - Please, what have you done with my wife? - How would I know? - You know everything. - Almost everything. Do you really want to see her? - Yes. And my child. - Your child? - Jason. - Where is Jason, Edmund? (dramatic music) - No, never. I want my wife. - Very well, Edmund. Go to her. Very few men, or women, have ever refused me in the course of the centuries. I will give you two hours, by clock time, to be completely alone with her. But then you'll be mine. Forever. (thunder rumbling) (thunder rumbling) (rainfall) (thunder rumbling) (thunder rumbling) - I gave him a sleeping pill. - We've got two hours, and then they'll come looking for us. They'll find him. I have to hide him in the summer trunk. (thunder roaring) - Now, remember what Mommy said. You mustn't go to the funny little man or the great big man or the bad lady. Even if they call you, Jason. You mustn't go to them. Do you promise? - I promise. - That's a good boy. (creaking) (thunder rumbling) No, Edmund. It doesn't work anymore. Ever since the first day we were married, there was always this mystery about you. At least I thought it was a mystery, but it wasn't. It was your retreat, that saved your... intellectual fantasies. And this house, where you hid me away with your books and your dreams. Whatever it is that's happening, Edmund, I have a feeling that it was born in that dream you've told me about and that you, and only you, have control of it. And now you've invited your friends here to destroy me, them, Jason, and finally yourself. You see, I'm not afraid to die, Edmund. It's Jason, I'm afraid for him. And I'm afraid for you, because maybe you haven't learned what a woman does when she knows her life is over. You wouldn't let anything happen to Jason. - No, darling. Never. (tense music) (Jason screaming) - You're a coward, Edmund. I realized that tonight, in the car. There's no point in lying to myself any longer. There are worse things. I could've married a machine, a drunk, a man who loved other women. At least you were gentle. (thunder rumbling) Time's running out, isn't it, Edmund? Come here. (moaning) (dramatic music) (door opening) (drumming) - Serge... - No, no, don't say anything, please. No pity. There's no need to be afraid. I'm a bit tired of myself anyway. And I'm tired of these needs. I'm an old Russian Orthodox, Edmund, born with an inherent fear of God. Old fashioned as that may seem, it comforts me. I have come to believe that God is both good and evil. Sometimes he speaks to us with terror, like Yahve or Mithras. Or Kali. I think death, true death, is a companion, not an enemy to life. - Come on, old man. You babble too much. - Serge! You really believe in God? - I believe in myself, Edmund. Therefore, I have faith in him. (soft music) Make it painless and quick, will you, my friend? I have a pressing engagement to keep. - He was the best of you all. Him and your wife, Edmund. And now, as night draws to a close, you are left. You and the child. But there can only be one survivor. And so, Edmund, it is either you or the child now. - There's no child! I'm the only one! - Oh, come, come, Edmund. You've already told me about Jason. Remember? Yes, you do. So now, tell us very quietly where he is. And soon, you will see the daylight beyond the trees. And the birds will sing. And there'll be no more fear for you, Edmund, none at all. You're a worm, Edmund. A lump of mud. You want so much to live, and you don't know how. - What would you do with him? (dramatic music) - (Nicole): Edmund, you wouldn't let anything happen to Jason, would you? - Why can't you find him yourself? Or is it that you can't hurt the innocent unless I... - Unless what, Edmund? - (Edmund): Nicole is dead. I have no promises to keep with the dead. - (Serge): I believe in myself, Edmund, and therefore I have faith in him. - (Edmund): What does God care? Serge was an old man about to die. He has an illusion to pave his way to ashes and dust. I could start again. After all, it was all a dream, my life; always books, ideas, illusions. Even the people around me-- Nicole, my friends, Jason. My love for them was only an author's love for his own creation. But it can create others, more and more. An artist is without end. He can never die. He's not allowed to die. He's upstairs in the attic. - Thank you, Edmund. (dramatic music) You lied, Edmund. - No! Nicole... the child... (whooshing) She's here. - Nicole is dead. Strangle him. (tense music) - No, no. (humming) She's come back. Ah! - If you catch him before I find the child, he's yours. If not, the child is mine. Now go. (screaming) (screaming) (dramatic music) (whimpering) (screaming) (screaming) Shut up. Shut up! - Leave my child alone. - You! - Mommy? - My husband, yes. My child, never. Put him down. Go to your room, Jason. Lock the door. - I don't want you to go away. - I have to, Jason. You're growing up now. You'll soon be on your own. Listen to your mother for the last time and go to your room. - Then Edmund is mine. - Kill him. (tense music) (grunting) (screaming) - Nicole! I had the dream again. Clearer than ever. So clear.
