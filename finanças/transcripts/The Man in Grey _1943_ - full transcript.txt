(gong ringing) (dramatic music) - Take it as I am offered no more? (gavel bangs) Clarissa's coffin and drangles. And now, lot 273, Hopners noted portrait of the eighth marquis of Rome, known as The Man In Grey. Now, gentlemen, at what may I start? Shall we say seven? Thank you, sir. 700 guineas, thank you. Eight, eight, eight, 800, thank you, Sir. 800 guineas, I thank you. 800 guineas, no more? 900, 900, thank you, Sir. 900 guineas, 900 guineas. Very well. (gavel thumping) (people murmuring) And now, gentlemen, we come to what, if I may lapse into the picturesque valance of our American cousins, and their lives. It may be described as the high spot in today's sale. - She was the famous regency beauty. - Oh? - Yes, she married the man in grey. - [Auctioneer] Now, shall we open at say, 1000? - Thank you, sir. - Yeah, I don't think the picture's so wonderful. - Then why are you bidding for it? - (chuckling) I'm not. - You waved your catalogue. - From the gentleman belonging to the armed forces. - That's you. - What? Good-good lord, I-- - 1500 guineas, may I hear 1600? Going at 1500 guineas. Going-- - 1600 over here, sir. - 1600, thank you, sir. - Oh. That would have taken my pay out the next war but three. - You daren't sneeze here, or you'll find you bought a gold dinner service. -19. 2000, 2000 guineas. 2000 once, twice? For the third and last time. (gavel bangs) (crowd murmurs) - Big dealers seem to be going. It doesn't seem to be anything important left there. - It's the next lot I'm interested in. I want it for my mother. We're kind of connected with the Rohans. - Really? - Mm. See there? That's the Rohan crest. Family's finished, you know, the last known Rohan was killed at Dunkirk. - Yes. - Bad luck, them having to sell up but I can't help wondering what they did to deserve all this. - Lot 275, a Georgian trinket box and contents comprising six items. Nothing here, gentlemen, of any great intrinsic value but of interest, having belonged to the marchioness of Rohan. Lady of the Lawrence canvas just so. Now 15 guineas. Thank you, sir, thank you. 15 guineas. - 16! - Thank you, yes, I got that. 16 guineas. - [Man] 17. -18. - It shouldn't be more than 20. He said it wasn't valuable. - Now, may I hear 19? Remember these trinkets once belonged to the most beautiful woman. What? (whispering) - Oh. Ladies and gentlemen, I regret the proceedings must close at once. It appears we are contravening the blackout regulations. The sale will continue tomorrow at 10:30 sharp. - Oh, blast the blackout. I shall have to back in tomorrow. - Oh, didn't you mean to? - No, I've got lots of shopping to do. I'm due back at my station in the evening. You know, I still don't think she's so hot. I've known lots of girls just as pretty. And far more intelligent looking. (scoffs) You coming here tomorrow? - Yes, we better make sure of our seats. Will you keep two chairs for tomorrow, please? One for Mr.-- Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know your name. - Rokeby, Peter Rokeby. - One for Mr. Rokeby and one for me. - [Man] Certainly, two chairs tomorrow for Mr. Rokeby and Lady Clarissa Rohan. - Clarissa Rohan? Oh my, I have put my foot in it, then. And that boy that was lost at Dunkirk was-- - My brother. I'm the last of the Rohans. - Oh, I'm sorry. And what I said about your family. - You're probably quite right. Heaven knows we never did do very much to deserve all this. But tell me, how are you connected with our family? - Oh, rather hazily, I'm afraid. I was shooting a bit of a line. But one of my ancestors was supposed to have been in love with the regency Clarissa Rohan. She's said to have given hm this. That's why I wanted this trinket box for my mother. She believes the story. And it's all rather pathetic, isn't it, these bits and pieces? Well they must have meant something to somebody once. Hm. A needle case, isn't it? And a funny little snuff box. What's that? - [Clarissa] It works, anyway. That's the lot. Not worthy of your bid, I'm afraid. - [Peter] Oh, you're too mercenary. Ooh, here's a prospectus from school. This Patchett's Establishment for young ladies, the White House Bath. Heh, I wonder who went there. (furniture clattering) - Oh I say, that little man wants to turn out the lights. We'd better go. - Oh. I just had a wonderful idea. I am sure there's a lot you can tell me about the regency Clarissa Rohan that I can pass onto my mother. So I-if you'd have dinner with me tonight, in a very informative way, of course. (voices trail off) (light music) (children playing) (cheerful music) (knocking on window) - Young ladies. Words fail me. What are you about? - We're throwing snowballs, ma'am. - Ladies never throw. Pray terminate this shocking spectacle and reenter the house at once. Miss Edge? - Yes, ma'am? - I wonder that you could permit such a thing. - I thought the exercise might be good for them, ma'am. - You thought? I do not pay you 15 pounds a year to think, Miss Edge. - No, ma'am. - [Miss Patchett] If you cannot distinguish between gentile exercise and hoydenish romping, I must find a young woman who can. - Yes, ma'am. - Miss Edge. - Yes, ma'am? - Will you inquire what that person wants? - Yes, ma'am. - Are you the new pupil, Miss Shaw? - Yes, ma'am. - You're very late. - Well there was no one to meet me at the inn. Are Miss Patchett's young ladies usually left to fend for themselves? - They do not usually arrive on stagecoach. They travel post or-- Or in their own parental equipages. - That should be made clear in Miss Patchett's prospectus. Kindly bring my things inside. - Miss Shaw, I presume. - Yes, ma'am. Miss Patchett, I presume. - You understand that it is out of my excessive regard for your stepmother that I am receiving you. When I heard of her situation, ruined by your father's imprudence, who left a widow with you on her hands, I could not resist the promptings of compassionate sensibility. - I understood she did you a service some years ago. And that you agreed to train me as a teacher by Way of repayment. (giggling) - Polly, don't stand there gaping. Take that harp into the young lady's room. - Yes, ma'am. And then take the luggage up to the attic next to Cook's. That will do very well for Miss Shaw. (ladies chattering and giggling) - Whose harp? - There's a new young lady, miss. - Better put your shoes on, Sally. The Crosspatch should be on us directly to present her. - Oh, the way Crosspatch shows us the new pupils. - Ahem, young ladies, I bring you charming plivelow, Miss Littyshaw Fitznoodle. (laughing) - Young ladies, I bring you a new companion. Perhaps companion is hardly the word, as Miss Shaw will in due course be engaged as a junior teacher. Nevertheless, I trust that you will welcome her as if she received the same advantages as yourselves. - Ever where you're from, Miss Shaw? - From Manchester. - Ah, one of the Manchester Shaws. (giggling) - Have you brought your clogs with you? - I don't wear clogs. Nor yet a shawl over my head. It isn't the custom. (hoofbeats clopping) - It's Clarissa! (ladies clamouring) - Who is Clarissa? - Why, she's, she's Clarissa. Parlour boarder. - She's the honourable Clarissa Richmond, daughter of the late Lord Carrey. - Which accounts for her popularity, I imagine. - Not at all. She's both lovely and amiable. Even you, Miss, will find her so. (ladies clamouring) - I have sweets for all so take your turn everybody. Here you are, Jane. Louisa. Dorothy. Who'd like this one? One for you and the last one for you. None of you is left out. I've even remembered myself. (ladies chattering) I'm Clarissa Richmond. Will you have a sugared violet? - No, thank you. I don't care for sugary things. - Are you cold, Clarissa? - No, somebody walked over my grave. - Come and show me the things you've brought. - [Clarissa] Marjorie, bring the-- (ladies clamouring) (ladies giggling and chattering) - Three stitches on my song for donning this. And Crosspatch gave me a double task. - She would. - My sister, Bella, has had an offer. It's only from the curer. And Marr thinks she'll take it. - NO- - And the third followed me, turned out to be a nun. Walled up, you know, like they always are. - How horrid. - How delicious. - Clarissa, make haste. You haven't curled your hair yet. - Oh, be a dear and do it for me? I must write in my journal. - All right. (bell dinging) - Now, what did I tell you? Now Patchet will be next. - Hm, tranquillise yourself, Miss Seymour. I'll show you how to manage old Crosspatch. - Hm. Miss Seymour. I shall not disturb Miss Richmond's devotions. I shall send Miss Edge to extinguish the candle in 10 minutes. - Yes, ma'am. - Good night, young ladies. No talking. (giggling) - Young ladies. No talking. Now I can finish my journal in peace. - Oh, I will come back when I have extinguished Miss Richmond's candle. All the young ladies are expected to be in bed when the bell is rung. - Except Miss Richmond, apparently. - My dear. She is the only girl in this school who will not despise you because you are disconnected and poor. - I prefer not to discuss my circumstances. (light music) - And afterwards, I spoke to the new pupil, Miss Shaw. She's a strange girl. Lovely, but somehow unhappy. She didn't seem to like me. I don't know why. But I'll make her. (ladies clamouring) - Has every young lady got her skates? - [Ladies] Yes, ma'am. - [Miss Pratchett] And a clean pocket handkerchief? - [Ladies] Yes, ma'am. - In this inclement weather, that is most necessary. Miss Edge. - Yes, ma'am. - Make haste. (sighs) So sad about dear Clarissa. (ladies chattering and giggling) (hoofbeats clopping) - Seems your ankle is mended again, Miss Richmond. - It was never sprained. I stayed in so that I could talk to you. Why do you dislike me? - You're rich and spoiled and beautiful. - I'm not rich. You're far more beautiful than I am. Although you sulk and scowl. - Well you're honest, I'll say that. And good natured. I'm neither. But you are spoiled. - Then I'll need a friend who won't spoil me. - I know you've tried to be nice to me. Don't think I'm not grateful. But that's what I've always had to be. Grateful "Thank you, kind sir. "Thank you, ma'am." All my life. - Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean that. - Friendship between us would bring you no good. And I don't want to do you harm. You see, in a way, I do like you. But I also envy you. - Oh, fiddlesticks. You shall share all I've got and then you can't be envious. Oh dear, I've said the wrong thing again. But you did you say you like me so we must be friends. (light music) - All right then. We're friends. Til we leave school. After that, our situations will be very different. - You'll never be a school maam, Hesther. It's ridiculous. - I agree with you. I have other intentions. - Oh miss, what do you think? Cook says you're pleased not to tell Madam but there's a gypsy fortune teller in the kitchen. - A fortune teller? Hesther, come. - There's a letter coming to you from over the water. Here's one who thinks more of you than you do of him. But it'll all come right in the end. You'll marry him and have six children. - One of my age? - She'll never now what you can do til you try. (laughing) - [Gypsy] Come in, young misses. Who's first. - You first. - No, you. - Pass me over silver. Here's a pretty fortune. Jewels, satins, gold. Marriage, yes. A rich one. You'll want for nothing. I see you in a splendid coach. You're with a man wearing grey. - Shall I marry him? - You will. But he's not the one for you. Here's your man. He comes from over the sea. - What is it? - Women isn't lucky to you, my pretty. Never make no friends of women. Here's one that will harm you. Remember my words, I warned you solemn. Never make no friends of women. - Your turn. - Well? - I can't tell your fortune. I won't. Not yours. - Ooh, I wonder what she meant by that. Oh, don't take any notice of her. She's been drinking. That's right, miss. Nasty, awful creatures them gipsies. They do say she stole a pheasant from across the road. Steal anything, gipsies would. Even a character. - Whatever do you think it was she saw in Miss Hesther's hand? - I knows. She a witch, that gypsy. - I'll not have this nonsense. - And that Miss Hesther, I think she a bigger witch. Gypsy's scared of her in case she cast a spell. - Well I never did, what a thing to say. - Out of my kitchen, you tainting people's names. Witch indeed, why the poor girl's gonna be a school mistress. That's all the bewitching she'll do. - Not she. Not while gentlemen have eyes. You should watch her in church Sundays. - [Cook] What, under Madam's very nose? - Well, Madam can't look 20 ways at once. There's been some very tender glances, I can tell you. From smiles to a billet-doux is short step. (church bells chiming) (light music) - Hesther? How are you feeling, dear? - My head's a little better, thank you. - I have brought you my heart's oil. I thought it might ease the pain. - Clarissa, you've been very good to me. You've given me so many things and you know, I'm fonder of you than I thought I could be. Of anyone. Here, take this. But I couldn't. I know how you treasure it. - Oh, don't refuse me. It isn't often I get a generous impulse. - Oh, very well then. It's very pretty. - It'll be a keepsake. - Don't talk as if we're going to part. - Oh, of course not. - Hesther. - Go now. My head aches, I'd like to be by myself. - [Clarissa] Good night. (tapping) - This is the most solemn moment in the history of this school. When a young lady tarnishes that beautiful but brittle jewel, her reputation, which is her duty to preserve preferably before life itself. (sobbing) Lena Hess, if you cannot control yourself, you had better leave the room. - Yes, ma'am. And now I'm going to be sick. - Oh, Miss Lena-- - Miss Shaw has disgraced her sex. Her name must never again be mentioned in this house. - Perhaps, ma'am, if she'd received kinder treatment here she would not have taken this step. - It is the duty of every well disposed young woman to try and secure a creditable establishment. Miss Shaw has eloped with a penniless ensign. I had hoped, my dear Miss Richmond, that this experience would have taught you to form your friendships more prudently in the future. - Hesther will always be my dearest friend. And I won't remain in a house where her name may not be mentioned. - Clarissa. - I shall write Master Lady Marr to take me away. - But Clarissa, you can't leave school until you have completed your education. You are a harp, my love. You're Italian. - I shall not speak Italian in my establishment. (gasps) - Miss Rissa. Is you going away? - Yes, Toby. One day I'll send for you to be my little page. - When, Miss Rissa? Miss Rissa, when? - When I've got an establishment. Life has been a whirl since I came to London. I'm deluged with invitations. And I heard today that they're calling me the Lovely Richmond. (light music) Tonight we go to the great Rohan Ball. - [Announcer] Duchess of Dorset. Lady Caroline, Lady (voice overwhelmed by chatter and music) - Plenty of fillies in the paddock tonight. - Yes, they've all been trotted out for Rohan's inspection. His mother's on the Warpath. - God pity the girl that marries Rohan. I wouldn't give him a dog that I cared for. - At least it would have a gold collar. (chuckling) - Lady Marr and Miss Clarissa Richmond. - Would you excuse me. - Glad to see you, Millicent. This your girl? Hm, she looks healthy. - Clarissa's never had a day's illness. Have you, my love? - Well I have had the measles and the mumps. - They are child's illness. Not worth mentioning. I trust my Lord Rohan is well? - Trust he is but he's not here. - Not here? - [Lady Rohan] Calm yourself, Millicent. He'll come. - Hm, I hope so. - [Lady Rohan] You better keep him a couple of dances. - Yes, ma'am. Lady Rohan. - 50 Cinderellas and no Prince Charming. It's just like Rohan. - But he's in town. I saw him in Whites this morning. - Ah, but you haven't seen this. R is for Rat, obnoxious and grey. Hated by all and now pray name the man? It's all over the town. See here, R-O-H-A-N. - The man in grey. A grey rat. How very apt. Who's the poet? - I don't know, but I'd wager Rohan does by now. (laughing) - And whoever he is, this is his swan song. - [Man] Here he is. (regal music) - Tell Miss we'll go straight to my room. - That's Rohan, the man in grey. - Ma'am, Craven. - [Craven] My coach broke an axleater rod. - Hm. Well you better go and get changed. I have half the young women in London waiting to meet you. - They'll keep. - Lord Rohan. - Excuse me, Lady Marr. - Oh, but I was to present my godchild, Clarissa Richmond. - The Lovely Richmond, eh? - Oh, then you agree that the sobriquet is suitable? - I should think there's about as much truth in it as the things they call you. - Eh, what do you mean? - The man in grey. It sounds like a ghost. - Rest assured, I shall never haunt the Lovely Richmond. (party chatter in the distance) - Alright, Abed. You'll excuse us, Lord Craven. - Yes, of course. - Give it to me. Who was it this time? - Don't alarm yourself, there'll be no inquest. - Who was it? - Young Croxly. - But he's only a boy. - He's old enough to lampoon me. - And skillful enough to pierce you. - The cab was drunk, I was careless. - So you killed a drunken boy. He who dishonours us, dies. - Young Croxly had admitted to learn French. But why the sudden concern for me? - I'm concerned only for the Rohans and their descendants. When a man has as many enemies as you have, the question of an heir, a lawful heir becomes pressing. - So I must select a brood mare. - If you'd like to call her that. No doubt your father used the same terms. - About you? - Of course. - And who would be the runners in these birthday stakes? - Every eligible thoroughbred. - Whose virtue is beyond question. - [Lady Rohan] Naturally. - I could choose a wicked woman. I'd shield and protect her from any suspicion of virtue. - Hm, no doubt. Now there are three excellent possibilities. Caroline Constantine, Mary Summerton and Clarissa Richmond. - A grisly array of girlish innocence. - Clarissa. Really, she's still just a schoolgirl. I should be in my boudoir, dear, if you want me. - Excuse me. - One moment, please. I want to speak to you. - Very well. - The matter can be put briefly. I've come to ask for your hand in marriage. - Marriage? But that's absurd. You don't even like me. - If that were so, I should be hardly making this application. - But surely-- Oh my. Is this an offer? - It is. - Sir. My Lord, I mean. I thank you. I'm very sensible of the honour that you do me but in this matter, my inclinations cannot be my only guide. And before I answer your application, I must consult with my guardian. - Were you told that at school? - Yes. - I've already applied to Lady Marr. The matter rests entirely with yourself. - Oh. Well I don't understand why you want to marry me. We scarcely know each other. - That can be remedied. May I call for you tomorrow in my carracle? - Yes. I should enjoy that. I've always wanted to ride in a carracle. - It's settled then. Should we say three o'clock? - Yes. (bright music) - But why does everybody write to congratulate me? I'm not engaged. - But you were driving with him. Oh, that's as good as announcing the engagement. - Nobody ever told me that. - What's the objection, child? - I don't love him. - Well, you cannot expect to have everything quite to our liking and I spent all I can afford to give you this opportunity. It wouldn't be in my power to remain another season in London and I assure you, you don't want to cause me any uneasiness. - Whose daughter she are, as long as she do well and are not afraid with any amazement. (church bells ringing) (hooves clopping) - Oh, Mrs. Armstrong. Leave the candles, please. - Very well, m'lady. Good night, m'lady. - Oh, Mrs. Armstrong. Would you open the window, please. - Qh, my lady. The night air? Surely you don't want to let in the night air. - No, perhaps not. Mrs. Armstrong, you've been here a long time, haven't you? - All my life, m'lady. My mother was head housemaid and my father was one of the game keepers. Why I saw his Lordship's mother come here as a bride. - Did you indeed? - She had her hair, powdered it was, on a cushion three feet high. You never saw-- (laughing) Oh, but there, I mustn't run on like this. His Lordship won't thank me if I stay here gossiping too long, heh-heh. - Would you put some more logs on the fire, please? - Yes, m'lady. - You've been married. Matrimony. Is a, is an agreeable state, is it not? - Of course, m'lady. - Own - Yes, m'lady? - (whimpers) Good night. - Good night, m'lady. (melancholy music) (dog barking and howling) (dog barking angrily) - Quiet there. - But if he's so good, how did he get so badly mauled. - Well you see, m'lord, he was up against a champion, Blue Boy. Heh-heh, a champion it was. - Was? - Yes, m'lord. You shoulda seen him in set of that Blue Boy. Threw at him the moment he got in the pit. Jamming them fangs into the Champion's throat. He hung on til he weakened. And then tore his windpipe right out. - Why didn't you wait til I was here? - Well, m'lord, I thought what with your wedding and that-- (scoffs) - Match him against Bren. - Yes, m'lord, but they'll be afraid to risk him against my dog now. - Then wager 100 guineas at 10. - Guineas, m'lord? - I'll pay if you lose. - Oh, thank you, m'lord. Thank you, oh-ho. - Tomorrow night at Dentry's barn. - Yes, m'lord. (melancholy music) (birds chirping) - Your chocolate, m'lady. - Thank you Mrs. Armstrong. - [Mrs. Armstrong] Good morning, m'lord. - You admire the view? - Very much. - My grandfather widened the river valley. My father cut down the wood and removed a small hill. - Indeed. You have breakfasted? - An hour since. It's the Rohan star. My mother charged me to give it to you this morning. - I don't want it. I don't like being married. I want to go back to my godmother. - That, of course, is impossible. - Well I can't stay here, I don't like it. - I shan't require you to stay for long. When we return to Grovener's Square we shall have our own rooms and go our own ways. You may do as you please and with your permission so shall I. - I should prefer that. Tell me. Are all husbands and wives like us? - [Lord Rohan] How do you mean? - Do they all make the same arrangements? - [Lord Rohan] Not invariably. I can't understand it. I don't want to seem discourteous but I can't understand why people like being married. - I must have an heir. - Is that why you married me? To have an heir? - It's all I ask of you. You're young and beautiful. Life can be very agreeable if you choose to be sensible. Take care of the star. Better tell your maid to put it away at once. (knocking on the door) - Come in. Toby! - Miss Rissa! - Oh, Toby. Toby, I am glad to see you. Let me look at you. - Miss Rissa, you didn't forget poor Toby. - Did you think I should? - At Madam Patchett's, they all laugh and say you'll sure forget. But I say, "No, some day Miss Rissa "get establishment like she promised." And now you've got establishment, Miss Rissa. - Yes, I've got an establishment now, Toby. - I wish you joy, Miss Rissa. I bought it for a wedding gift. - Oh, thank you, Toby. I'll always treasure it. (gasps) - Why, Miss Rissa is you crying? - I'm not crying, Toby. It's just that I'm so happy to have a friend. Today is our fourth wedding anniversary. Yet more and more do I realise that marriage does not really mean happily ever afterwards. I am the richer by a magnificent ruby from Rohan. But I would rather have a bunch of flowers given in love. (light music) - Mr. Lawrence. Is my little boy really as pretty as that? - [Mr. Lawrence] Your ladyship should be the better judge. - I scarcely see him. My husband insists that he stays at Rohan Castle. - [Mr. Lawrence] And you do not care for Rohan Castle? - I think it's an odious place. Didn't you think so when you were there? - [Mr. Lawrence] Mm, rather too large for comfort. - Far too large. Dare I tell you a strange thing? Whatever room you may go into, you're certain to find my mother in law playing Bezique with a curate. (chuckling) - [Mr. Lawrence] Yes, I observed that. - You paint me as a happy mother. I'm not very happy- I'm scarcely a mother. The child hardly knows me. When he's five, he's to have a tutor but after that, he's to go to Eton. He's never really been mine. And yet I smile because I'm supposed to be happy. - No, Lady Rohan, you smile because you're fortunate. - Aren't they the same thing? - A dairy maid can be happy but she's not obliged to smile when she's retched. The fortunate must pay their debt. A great lady must never be seen without a smile. (laughing) - My luck's out tonight. - But there's laughter in heaven. - And praise to all who laughs when you lose. - Clarissa, darling. How are you? - Hi, Jane! It's an age since I saw you. Where have you been? - I've been in Yorkshire and versatile, dull I found it. Corning home, what do you think I saw? Here. - When did you get this? - Yesterday in St. Albans. It must be Hesther Shaw. She ran off with a man called Barbary. - I must go at once. She may have gone before I can get to her. - But surely you don't want to see her. - But of course. She's my friend. (hooves clopping) - Now Mary, don't grumble. We're going to see a play and you know you love a play. - Yes, I know, but not at this time of night. Leaving on the spur of the moment without any time to pack. Oh, we don't even know we can get a room at the inn. - We can arrange all that before we go to the theatre. - Yes, but we're terribly late and, oh, I wish we'd brought a footman. - We want no more weight. I like to travel fast. - Hold. Where are you going? Speak up. - Kindly address yourself to me. - Your servant, ma'am. Don't be alarmed by my somewhat battered appearance. It's the result of a too-close acquaintance with a gorse bush where my horse threw me. Now the poor beast's gone lame. So I must-- (man chuckling) - Don't harm the boy. We'll give you our money. (chuckling) - You mistake me, ma'am. I'm no cutpurse. - [Clarissa] Then why the pistols? - They're merely my passports to a journey in this coach. You see, my horse has gone lame, and I-- - You have a strange way of asking favours. I should have thought-- - Wait ma'am. Were you never told not to interrupt? Ow! I shall do you no harm but I insist on your taking me to St. Albans. Inside, Sir Galahad. (coach creaking) Well, shall we proceed? - The sooner the better. Drive on. - Qh, my lady. Oh. - A ladyship. Oh, I'm in luck. Tell your maid I shan't cut her throat. " Oh! - You're not afraid of this person, are you Molly? - Yes, m'lady, I am. (man laughing) - There are the lights of St. Albans. If you pull the check string, I'll get out. - It's a pleasure. - [Driver] Whoa, there. - Thank you, my lady. Oh, perhaps you'd accept these weapons as souvenirs. - (gasps) They're just pieces of wood. - Yes, my mother told me never to point firearms at a lady. Especially so lovely a lady. (gasps) (light music) Alright, there. Drive on. (hooves clopping) - Oh, my lady, did you ever know such imputence? - Never. Never. - He hath commanded me to go to bed and bade me to dismiss you. - Dismiss me? - [Desdemona] It was his bidding. Therefore, good Emelia, Adieu. - [Emilia] We must not now displease him. I would you had never seen him. - [Desdemona] Oh, so would not I. My love doth not so approve him. That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns-- Prithee unpin me. Have grace and favour in them. - [Desdemona] I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed. Were not getting it over. There are ducks who are putting on a scene in the stage box. At your turn at that. - My mother had a maid called Barbara. She had a song of willow. An old thing 'twas. - She died. - She died singing it. That song tonight will not go from my mind. - That lady, you remember. Miss Hesther at Bath. - Yes, I remember. ♪ Sing all our green willow ♪ ♪ Willow, willow, willow ♪ ♪ Oh me, the green willow ♪ ♪ My garland must be ♪ (sighs) Prithee hide thee. He'll come along. Good night, good night. Heaven me such uses send. Not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend. (light applauding) - It is the cause, my soul. It is the cause. Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars. It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood. - Miss Rissa, that's the highwayman gentleman. - Whiter hers than snow. And smooth as monumental alabaster. - A strolling player. Oh, my lady, that's worse than a highwayman. - So that's why he wanted to get here so quickly. - Put out the lights and then put out the lights. If I quench thee thou flaming minister I can thy former light restore. Should I repent me but once put out thy light. Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature, I- Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature, I know not where is that Promethean heat that can thy light relume. Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade justice to break her sword! One more, one more. - Molly, pencil and paper. - Qh, my lady. - It's alright, it's not for the highwayman. - [Othello] One more, and this the last. So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep. But they are cruel tears. This sorrow's heavenly. It strikes where it doth love. She wakes. - Who's there? Othello! - Aye, Desdemona. Who's in the stage box, do you know? - Will you come to bed, my lord? The marchioness of Rohan. - Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona? - Aye, my lord. - I never saw such loveliness in my life. - Toby- Go to the back of the stage and give that note to Miss Hesther. Tell her I'll send a carriage around later. - Yes, ma'am, yes Miss Rissa. Miss Rissa? Remember the gypsy wouldn't tell Miss Hesther's fortune. Miss Hesther, she not lucky. Miss Hesther, she-- - Toby, do as I say. - Yes, Miss Rissa. - [Highwayman] I will not kill thy soul - Talk you of killing? - Aye. I do. How do you know her? - Kill me tomorrow, let me live tonight. I went to school with her. - Nay if you strive. You weren't in school with her. - But half an hour. I tell you, I was. - Being done, there is no pause. Something is not you, in return. - While I say one prayer. I have lived all my life with scum like you. - Oh! (gagging) - That's enough. You brute. - Toby- Why haven't you gone? - Miss Rissa, the black gentleman, he know what Miss Hester is. He done strangle her. - Don't be silly, Toby, it's only a play. Now run along. - Yes, Miss Rissa. But that black gentleman, he know best. (Hesther moaning) - Not dead. Not quite yet dead. - No thanks to you if I'm not. - Aye that am cruel am yet merciful. I would not have thee linger in my pain. So, so. Now try and answer back. - It's a meal for a princess, my lady. - You can go now, Molly. I'll call you again when I want you. - Very well, m'lady. - Hesther! Oh, Hesther, I'm so glad to see you. But you didn't bring your husband with you. - It was scarcely practical. He died two years ago. - Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought perhaps Mr. Rokeby might-- - Rokeby, my husband. Heaven protect me, no. - Well we'll have supper at once. You must be ravenous. - No, I'm not really hungry. - Oh, and I planned all this so carefully. - I seldom eat after a performance. - Just a little cold roast duck. I know how you used to dote on it. Molly! - Your ladyship has a wonderful memory. - Your ladyship? - You used to call me Clarissa. - You're very condescending, Clarissa. - You're as pretty and as provoking as ever. (sobbing) (dramatic music) - Why, Hesther. Oh, Hesther, don't. - You couldn't begin to imaging the degradations I've had to face. The poverty, the squalor. Filthy lodgings. Bills. Bills always unpaid. I can tell you I've seen life, one side of it since I ran away from Patchett's. You see, Ned, my husband, left the army. He had to. We tried many things. But then we were off with our keep by a company of strolling players. After he died, I stayed on. - I always said you wouldn't be a school mistress. Remember? - I remember. But if second chances were offered in this world, I wouldn't be so high and mighty now. - Hesther. You're coming to London with me. - What do you mean? - No, this isn't charity. You said just now you'd rather be a governess than remain on the stage. - People don't choose their governesses from strolling players. - You'd go to the devil if you will interrupt me. I have a little boy down at Rohan Castle. He's left far too much with the servants. And I need somebody to teach him. Wouldn't you take on the job? - Then what would my Lord Rohan say? - Oh, I don't think he could object. Come up to London and I'll arrange it. - Would you tell him where you found me? - Well, perhaps it would be better not. What do you say? - I say, yes. - Then you will stay here the night. And in the morning, we will drive down-- - No, I must go get my things and tell them at the theatre. I'll come back in the morning. - You must have my coach. You can't possibly walk in the rain. - My dear Clarissa, you'd be surprised at the things I'd learned to do since I left Bath. - Miss Rissa. I got something for you. I kept it til she gone. - Where did this come from? - That gentleman sent it, Miss Rissa. - [Clarissa] What gentleman? - That black, white gentleman. - What do you mean? - When the Highwayman gentleman done killed Miss Esther on the bed, he a black devil. When I see him he done go white, Miss Rissa. White as our lord. He give me the flowers and he say, "You give them to lovely lady," he say. "When nobody by." - Was that all? - He give me this guinea. - Oh, thank you, Toby. Good night. - Good night, Miss Rissa. (light music) - [Rokeby] While I ask pardon for my highwayman manners, I cannot create forgiveness for the way I said farewell. But though I should be penitent, how can I regret a moment that is perhaps all I shall ever know of paradise. - And this is the very place he held us up. - I see now. He did so that he be in time for the play. - Heh-heh, trust Rokeby to get what he wants. - He's an unusual man. Has he always been an actor? - Well to my way of thinking, he never has. Then he's been everything by turn. Actor, tutor, blacksmith, poet and horse coper. - Where-- (chuckles) Where did he come from? - Eh? - This Mr. Rokeby. - Oh, from the West Indies or some such place. He says he has an estate on an island off the Jamaican coast. - Why does he lead the life of a strolling player? - Well he has some story about the French seizing this island and turning it over to the natives and he says it's too much trouble to put the matter right. - To think he had the impudence to kiss you, ladyship. - He kissed you, did he? - Oh please don't talk about it. It's something I want to forget. - You had better stop giving me things until we're sure Lord Rohan will let me stay. - Oh but you will. I don't often ask him favours. But this time I shall insist. - You can influence him? - No, but we have an understanding. I go my way and he goes his. Come, try it on. - That sounds as if you don't love him. - I never have. Nor he, me. All the world knows that. Were you in love with your husband? - Very dearly. But we were both so young. We never had a penny. He died in my arms. - You're lucky to have been loved. (hoofbeats approaching) That's he. That's Rohan. I wonder if this is the best time to see him. Yes, I'll go now and settle it. Good afternoon. - Well good afternoon, Clarissa. - Did you find everything well at the castle? - Yes, thank you. - My Son? - Well enough. He's learning to ride. And you found means of diverting yourself? - Yes, I've been gaming and to the playhouse. On Thursday, I went to Lady Vespa's. The Prince was there with Mrs. Fitzherbert. I think she's delightful. - Uh-huh. - Rohan, I have a guest here. An old school friend of mine, a widow. - I believe there are plenty of rooms. - Well you don't understand. I want her to stay here permanently. - Eh? - I think she'd be a good governess for David, and then we could have him here with us. I'm sure she'd be excellent. She was Miss Patchett's cleverest pupil. - The child needs no governess, I intend to leave him down at Rohan Castle. - But Rohan, I've promised. - There's no more to be said. If you will choose to commit yourself. (door opening) - Oh, excuse me. I wasn't aware. - No, Hesther, don't go. I want to present my husband. This is Mrs. Barbary of whom I was speaking. - [Rohan] How do you do? - Thank you, my lord, I'm well. I'm a trifle confused. I had expected to find only Clarissa here. - My wife tells me that she has made certain promises to you which are impossible of fulfilment. Oh, I understand. I'll leave tomorrow. - Mrs. Barbary. You've misunderstood me. If you wish it, you may remain here indefinitely. Not as governess, but as my wife's companion. - Rohan. - Your lordship is most kind. (dramatic music) - I've never been so happy as in these last few weeks. Allowing Hesther to stay here is the kindest thing Rohan's ever done for me. Perhaps I've misjudged him. - Take these packages to my room. - Yes, madam. - Is her ladyship in? - No, madam. - Oh. - Mrs. Barbary? Lord Rohan would like a word with you please. - Of course. In the library? - No, no. In his lordship's own rooms. (knocking on door) (door opening) - You wish to speak to me, my lord? - Yes, Mrs. Barbary. You're quite comfortable here? - Yes indeed, my lord. - And no thought of leaving us? - Why no, how could I after your great kindness? - You're not regretting your decision to stay? - On the contrary, I-I never knew such unobtrusive comfort could exist. That flowers could bloom so sweetly in winter. Or fires burn all clay so recklessly for people who sometimes never come in. I never knew the magic of a French cook. Or the luxury of reading books fresh from the printers. Or that carriages could glide so smoothly. - Did not your husband give you these things? - No, my lord, we were not wealthy. We lived very quietly. - Mrs. Barbary, I'm not an easy man to deceive. Why try to deceive me? - What do you mean? - A poor lone widow from St. Albans. I believe it was St. Albans. - I have lived there. - After your lamented husband's death. - That is true. - Mrs. Barbary, shall I refresh your memory? So far from being a respectable lone widow, you're a strolling player with a reputation that would not bring discredit to a woman of the streets. And as for this husband whom you so wistfully described as having passed away in your loving arms, he died of jail fever in fleet prison after you'd deserted him in favour of a more wealthy protector. - You appear to be well informed, my lord. - Was this deception your idea or my wife's? - She thought it better not to mention the stage. The rest I didn't tell her. - I can understand you reticence. - Can you? I know this means I must go, but why should you presume to judge me? You've never known what it is to be a pauper. To see others enjoying the things you know should be yours. I've known it all my life. True, I lied and cheated my way into this house. Well, I'd do it again. You've got everything here I've always wanted. Wealth and comfort and luxury. You sneered at me because I was a strolling player. I was. I did deserve my husband because he was a failure and I don't intend to fail no matter how I have to do it or who has to suffer. One day I'll get the things I want. And they won't be doled out to me on charity. And not you nor 100 others like you, with your smug self-satisfied arrogance, will stop me! Get out of my way! Let me go! - Ah! Oh, no. I never thought to find a woman with a spirit as ruthless as mine. You take what you want until the devil were the consequences. So do I. (trumpeting horns blasting) (crowd clamouring) - That's Mogul, sir, Lord Rohan's beast. - Hm, what's known about his chances? Is he here? - Over there, sir, with Mrs. Barbary. - Oh, so that's the Barbary, hey? - He came down in style with her on one side and his wife on the other. - I don't like to see it I have a regard for Lady Rohan. - You don't like her, do you? You hear that, gentlemen? Mrs. Fitzherbert doesn't like the Barbary. We'll quiz Rohan until he leaves the Barbary at home. - Can I still get the odds? - I think so, m'lord. - Then wager another thousand guineas. - Yes, m'lord. - 100 of it is yours. - You're too generous, Rohan. - And you're too effusive. These people are Clarissa's friends. Where is she? - Oh, gone off somewhere with that nigger urchin of hers. - You better find her. The race will start soon. - [Man With Sword] 26 inches of cold steel. The slightest nick means death. (drum beating) - Ladies and gentlemen, it is my proud privilege to introduce to you, Abdul, the scourge of Stamboul. Umlagi, the Nubian Hercules who at Barnes' fair, with no other weapons but his mighty arms fought a full grown-- - Miss Rissa. - The black, white gentleman, over there. With all the half naked gentlemen. - So it is. - That's right, Miss Rissa. The highwayman gentleman who done kiss you. - That'll do, Toby. Come along. - Men, they await your challenge. Ladies, come inside and see what your husbands are made of. - Hey, Zambo. Zambo you bark for a while. - But Miss Rissa. Why are you go away? - We must get back to the others, Toby. - Lady Rohan. - Are you addressing me, sir? - Well I don't hope that you remember but we once shared a coach to St. Albans. - I'm never to forget my more unpleasant experiences. - I deserve that but I had hoped my note-- - Yes, and the flowers. I'd forgotten the flowers. But they don't excuse your conduct. - Of course not. - Then we'll say no more about it. - Well that's generous of you. And to show that you really have forgiven me, may I show you the fair? - Oh, no, I haven't time, I must be getting back. - Please. - I'm sorry. - Got it. - You won! - What would you like, sir? There you are, sir. - Thank you. Well here's a thing and a very pretty thing. Do you accept this pretty thing? - Thank you. (chuckling) (whistling) (laughing) I wonder where Toby is. - The last time I saw him he was watching my nigger Zambo beating the drum. He was very impressed. - Would you wait for me a moment? - [Man] Find the lady, my lucky gentlemen. Find the lady. The more you put down, the more you-- Find the lady, my lucky gentleman. The more you put down, the more you'll pick up. - Don't you remember me? You once told my fortune in Bath. You said I'd marry a man in grey. - So I did, my lovely ladyship, so I did. And you have, eh? Aye, it's all here. I told you he wasn't the one for you. That another would come from over the seas. Aye, that's the one. - But that's absurd. We scarcely know each other. I must go. - Not before I've warned you. Remember what I told you before? Women isn't lucky to you. Never forget that. As one who is out to harm you, she'll-- - Well, what does the future hold for her ladyship? Health, wealth? She has these. How 'bout happiness? - That's there, if she'll grasp it. - Well if you've finished hers, how 'bout tending to mine? - Ask the lady. She knows. (crowd clamouring) - What did she mean? Can you tell a fortune? - Give me your hand. You should ought to go back to the place you come from, my pretty gentleman. - Where's that? - Way across the sea, far, far way. I see a T. No, it's a J, that's Jamaica. Black men isn't lucky for you, my pretty gentleman. They'd taken away what's yours. - How the devil-- I beg your pardon. How on earth-- - It's in your hand my pretty gentleman. I can see an island. - Hm? (laughing) - Tell me about your island. (crowd cheering) - Is Mogul winning? - Come up here along with me, my dear. There's room. - No, thank you. (hoofbeats stampeding) Mogul, what's happened to Mogul. - Still running Madame. Sun Style's won. (drum beating) - Calm down, calm up. Ladies and gentlemen. It is my proud privilege to introduce to you, on my left, Abdul, the scourge of Stamboul. On my right, Umlagi-- - Toby- You will get a whipping for this. Where's her ladyship? - Over there with the black, white gentleman. - Go back to the carriage and wait. - Yes, Miss Hesther. - There are hummingbirds no bigger than butterflies. Brighter than jewels. And flowers like you've never seen before. Then there's the house. You'd love the house. It's cool, white, gracious. The pillared colonnades. - [Clarissa] Sounds lovely. When I was a little girl, I used to dream of a place like that. Adorable place that I seem to know so well. - I've been looking for you everywhere. - (whistling) Why, if it isn't the Barbary. But how do you two-- So that was how you were able to tell my fortune. - The race is over. - Oh, and I missed it. Did Mogul win? - No, he didn't. And I fear Lord Rohan will be very annoyed at your absence. - Oh, I must go make my peace with him. Will you take these? Oh, except that. I'd like to keep that. Good bye. - Good bye. (light music) (laughing) - Madame Circe, allow me to present Madame Barbary. You know, you two should know each other. You have so much in common. Well, why did you send for me? - I'm living with the Rohans at Grovener's Square. - I congratulate you. - His lordship needs a librarian. I could put your name forward for the post. - Why should you? - I'd like to do a good turn to an old friend. - We were never friends and you never did anybody a good turn since you were born. Does Lady Rohan know about this? - Why do you ask? - Did she send you? - As if I should tell you. There is such a thing as honour among women, you know. - Oh, I see. You often send her on errands like this? - One must endeavour to please one's employers. All women are very much the same, you know. We should, none of us, be put on pedestals. Do you accept'? - Hm? Oh, yes. I'd be a fool to refuse, wouldn't I? - Then you'd best call at Grovener's Square in the morning. I'll speak to Lord Rohan and (voice trails off). - [Mr. Rokeby] Good morning, m'lady. - Mr. Rokeby. What on earth are you doing here? - Librarians are usually to be found in libraries. - Your occupations seem to change somewhat. First you're a highwayman, then an actor, then a barker at a fair. And now you're a librarian. I wonder what you'll be next, Mr. Rokeby. - Well that depends on your ladyship. - On me? I don't understand. - Don't you? And yet you knew I was coming here. - Knew? I'm astounded. You know you do turn up in the most unexpected places. - You mean you had no idea of my coming here? - Well I told you, Mr. Rokeby. Why do you keep asking? - Oh, I just wanted to make sure. (chuckling) So, it seems I have Mrs. Barbary to thank for my good fortune. - Hesther? Oh, so she arranged it to surprise me. Isn't that just like her? - Yes. Just like her. - Well, please don't take my surprise as lack of welcome. Of course I knew Lord Rohan wanted a new librarian but I'd no idea it'd be you. - It wouldn't have been if Mrs. Barbary hadn't sought me out and offered me the post. She gave the impression the idea was yours. - You must have mistaken her. But I'm very glad you're here. - I shan't be for long. I'm to go to Rohan Castle. - Oh, you won't like it there. I should think you'd find that poor exchange for the house you're telling me of. The white house with the pillared colonnade and the hummingbirds and the flowers. - Except that it's in ruins. My father died defending it. - What happened? - Oh, the French incited the slaves and they rose and murdered every white man on the island. - But have you never tried to get it back? - No. No, I'd have to do a deal of killing before I could reclaim it. I'd rather bark at fairs or browse among the books of Rohan Castle than make targets of poor blacks. - You like people, don't you? I do too. The world would be a much happier place if people like each other a little more. - [Granger] Your horse is waiting, m'lady. - I must go. (light music) I've kept you too long with my chattering. - [Granger] My lady. - Thank you, Granger. I shall have something to say to Hesther for not telling me you were coming. - Yes, I should have something to say to her too. - Isn't it a lovely day? (hoofbeats clopping) - Tomorrow night? - I don't see how I can. Clarissa's going to the masquerade. I can't always have a headache. - If you'd let me find a house for you, you could break with Clarissa. - Why me? Suppose you break with Clarissa? - Eh, what do you mean? Oh, no. You can put that thought right outta your head. There'll be no scandal. - Very well. We must wait. Perhaps she'd go to Rohan Castle soon. - She can't endure the place. - I have an idea she may find it more endurable this summer. - Let's hope you're right. (light music) - Well good morning. You're up early. - What are you doing here? Get out! - Dear, dear, how unfriendly. I was hoping for a nice little chat. - What do you want? - I'll tell you just this. I've seen now why you brought me here. You wanted Clarissa and me to fall in love with each other, didn't you? Well, as far as I'm concerned, you've succeeded. But as a cover for your affair with Rohan, it's not going to help at all. - You're going to tell her? - No. No, she has a quality you wouldn't understand. Loyalty to her friend. She wouldn't believe me. - Then what do you want? You say you love her. Well, so do I him. And if anyone tries to come between us, so much the worse. I have no quarrel with those who don't interfere. But if you love her, keep her from getting in my way. - Pretty speech and endearing character. Has anyone ever told you what a slut you are? - Oh, you an insult me if you wish but I tell you-- - For once you've spoken the truth, my dear. I do believe you would stop at nothing. - Then remember it. - But there's one factor you've overlooked. Me. You see, I'm not a gentleman. And I swear by god that if she comes to any harm through you, I'll break that lovely neck of yours with less regret than I'd stamp on a snake. (gasps) Good night! - [Clarissa] He's been gone a week and Grovener's Square is intolerable without him. For the first time, I wish I was at Rohan Castle but of course I cannot follow him. I'd reached the castle in the morning. He was surprised to see me and looked grave. But I made him take me out on the lake and soon we were laughing as I could neither of us have laughed since he went away. The sun was shining and birds singing overhead and I knew that life had some meaning again. I can't think how I ever came to dislike Rohan Castle. But then, I'd never seen it in the autumn. I can't stay much longer and yet I can't bare to speak of going. Today I told him. Our gallop within the downs had made me bold. Indeed when I'm riding with Rokeby, I seem to lose all sense of fear. So I told him quite plainly that it was not my wish he should remain at Rohan Castle over the winter. He answered very coldly and pretended he'd misunderstood me. But what am I to do? I can't impeach him to follow me to London. Back in Grovener's Square. But every hour of the day is empty without him. I'd dress myself and go out and smile and dance and chatter, but I scarcely know what I'm doing. I must go away. I must get the better of this madness. For it is madness to love a man who never thinks of one. So I went to the George Lams for almost a week. But when I returned to Grovener's square it was more miserable than ever. And then, I went into the library and he was there. We didn't say anything because there was nothing we needed to say. (light music) I love him. I love him and he loves me. But now he wants to leave me to sail to Jamaica and win back his island so that he can take me there. I tried to dissuade him but he seems determined. - Toby. Do you know what I was doing? - No, Miss Hesther. I never done see you reading Miss Rissa's diary. - Do you remember when the gypsy refused to tell me my fortune? You told them in the kitchen it was because I was a witch. - No, Miss Hesther. If they tell you that, they try to make me trouble. - But it's true, Toby. You're the only one clever enough to know it. So you see, if you ever tell anybody anything about my reading that book, I'll know. I can hear what's being said 100 miles away. So take care, Toby. Because if I get angry, the flesh will drop off your bones and your heart will burn up. - Yes, Miss Hesther. - Hah. - Oh, Clarissa. I-I just came in to find you. - Hesther, I'm in a hurry. What is the matter with Toby? I met him in the corridor racing as though the devil were at his heels. Hesther, there's something I want to tell you. - Yes? - Rokeby and I are in love. - Rokeby? I never dreamt it. - He wants to go back at once to the West Indies. - Well, you'll go with him? - I want to but he said he must clear off the rebel slaves before he'd dare take me there. - Well it's not for me to persuade you but if you love him, whatever the danger is, you should face them with him. - You think so too. I'll insist. I'll tell Rohan. I'll ask him to set me free. - Tell Rohan before you go? But that would be fatal. He'd stop you. - But Rokeby insists upon telling him. - Clarissa, for heaven's sake, don't let him. - Why not? Rohan's not in love with me. - But don't you see, they'll fight. Rohan will kill him. - Of course. Rokeby wouldn't avoid it. I'll dissuade him. I must fly. - Mrs. Barbary. One moment please. - Yes, my lord. - Whom has Clarissa gone to meet? - How should I know? - Don't lie to me. It's Rokeby, isn't it? - Rokeby? I don't believe it. - Then you haven't used your eyes. Clarissa may have as many lovers as she pleases but she must choose them decently. - What will you do? - Keep her at Rohan Castle til she comes to her senses and send him out of the country. - You won't let her go? - And tell the world my wife's deceived me with a lackey? Her ladyship, what was her destination? - Vauxhall Gardens, m'lord. (orchestral music) - Oh, Miss Rissa. Master Rokeby. My lord, him coming. I think he looking for you, Miss Rissa. - We must go. - No. No, this settles it. Lord Rohan. - [Lord Rohan] Who's there? - [Rokeby] It's Swinton Rokeby. A word with you please. - Go to my carriage at the west gate. - Just one moment, Lord Rohan. - That'll do, Rokeby, I'll deal with you presently. - You may as well have the truth now. Your wife believes that I can make her happier than you've ever tried. I ask you to set her free. If you feel your honour demands satisfaction, I place myself at your disposal. - I may be obliged to thrash you, Rokeby, but we can hardly fight. And as for your freedom, Clarissa, coming from this adventurer, the suggestion's damned insolence. No doubt, when he learns that apart from you marriage settlement, you're penniless, and that even that will be forfeit if you disgrace my name he'll think better of his bargain. - Well, there's only one answer to that. Go home and pack any clothes you need. I'll call for you later tonight. - Swinton, you wont'-- - Please, go. (light music) - Wait. You damned arrogant swine. It's time someone told you the truth about yourself. Just because you've had everything poured into your lap and better men to do your bidding, you think you're some kind of being apart. Well, you're not. You're just a well bred scoundrel whose treatment of his wife has been beyond contempt. You tricked her into marrying you to perpetuate your rotten line. You gave her no love, no understanding and now you betray her in her own home with a friend she trusts. All London condemns you for it and will applaud her for leaving you. - I've changed my mind about thrashing you, Rokeby. It'll give me great pleasure to kill you. Name your time and weapons. (grunting) - Well. The time is now and weapons are these. (dramatic music) Ooh! - Rohan. We can't have this. Get these people away. Rohan, what the devil? This is no place for a sparring match. Come away, man. - Not til I finished with this fellow, sir. - Not here, the place is far too public. Come away. (light music) - Mr. Rokeby. - [Swinton] What? - Forgive me. I know your name and a little of the circumstances. People are talking. - Let them talk. I'll take her away from all this. - I don't think you realise how cruel her position would be. The slights, the indignities. I know better than most. - I'll take her far away. The West Indies. I'll make a home for her there. - [Mrs. Fitzherbert] What's to become of her while you're making it? - Well, that's the trouble. I had meant to come back for her when I could offer her safety and security but Rohan's insults. - Has insults changed the situation? Don't sacrifice her because you're angry. - But how can I leave her with him after this. - I fancy, when you are gone, her friends would insist on a separation. She has many partisans. Influences might be exerted which would be more persuasive than your fists. - I've sent Toby for a post chase. He'll meet you at the corner of the square. - Bless you, Hesther. I've left some rings and my seed pearls on the dressing table. They're for you in case you are in difficulties. - This note just came for you. - It's from Rokeby to tell me where... Hesther. He's gone. He's gone without me. - No. No, it's impossible. He-- "A good friend has persuaded me..." The fool. Clarissa! Clarissa. Don't lose your head. Quick, the back stairs. - Where is Clarissa? - She's lying down in her room. She has a headache. - She's gone to that fellow. - To Rokeby? - I half expected it. I should have been here before but the prince detained me. - I swear, I had nothing to do with it. But you'll go after her? Perhaps she's only gone to Lady Marr's or the William Lam's. Go to them. Go to everyone you can think of. - What? Go around the town beating after my wife? It would be a pretty exhibition. Let her go. It's too late to avoid a scandal now. If she likes mud, let her sink in it. (door opening) (light music) - Oh, I thought you'd gone. I was so terrified you'd be gone. - Oh, my darling, why did you come? Didn't you get my note? - Yes, but I couldn't let you go alone. - Well that's why I didn't say goodbye. - You've got to take me with you. I don't mind the dangers, I can face anything with you. I know you're thinking of my safety but I'm thinking of our happiness. My place is with you. Hesther says so too. Women see things differently, you know. - It's not possible, Clarissa. Darling, come and sit down. There'll be weeks of fighting. I can't take you to an island overrun by half-crazed savages. - But you said you'd take me with you. - I know. That was Rohan's insults. I was mad to think of it, even for a moment. - But, if you go without me, I know, I know something will happen. We'll never be together again. - Darling, don't, please. God knows there's nothing I wouldn't do for you but for your safety I can't take you with me. And for your happiness, I-l must first own back the things that are mine. - I can't go back to Rohan. - Oh, you've not read my note. You're to go to Lady Marr til I return. Oh, believe me, darling, it's the only way. And if you're to be my wife, you must learn to obey me. - Must I go now? - No. Not now. Stay with me til I sail. Look how calm the night is. It's a good omen. To have a calm sea and a following wind. - The moon is high. There are clouds coming up. - And this time next year, we'll watch it rise over the magnolias in our own garden. - In the house with the white colonnade overlooking the sea. - My travels will be over. I shall have brought all duty home with me. And nothing left worth seeing in the world. - I don't think I an bear this. I'm sorry but I can't, I really can't. - Oh, we must. - Swinton. Take this. Give me something of yours. - This? I don't want to come home and find you taking snuff. It's an abominable habit for a woman. - I shall smoke cheroots like the ladies of the Spanish town. How long have we got? - About 10 minutes. - And then, before you sail? - You see that sea wall? (water lapping) When the water reaches the tide mark we shall leave the harbour. - I shall watch your ship until I can't see it anymore. - No, go inside. You'll be cold out here. - I want to see it to the very last. - Clarissa, there's something I've got to say to you. I wish you wouldn't place so much confidence in Hesther. I tried to warn you before but every time I say it-- - Don't spoil our last moments together. She's the only friend I've got. The only person who ever loved me before you came. - Darling. - We only had one summer together. It's not much in a lifetime, is it? - There'll be others. - No. No others. - If I thought that I wouldn't go. I couldn't live without you, Clarissa. I couldn't live without you. The beginning and end of everything I've ever wanted. I couldn't lose you, I couldn't. - How foolish we are. It's less than a year. - A day without you is too long. - So many ships sail across the world every day and back again. It's nothing. It's time you went. Better go now. Quickly. (light music) - Take care of her, Toby. And never leave her alone with Mrs. Barbary. - No, Master Rokeby. That Mrs Barbary, she deadly nightshade. - Mm. Goodbye, Toby. (water lapping) (dramatic music) - Miss Rissa, please come in. You catch cold, Miss Rissa. - Courage, Toby. I want to go as soon as I can't see the ship anymore. - Yes, Miss Rissa. (ominous music) - Why have you brought me here? - We're looking after you. - No, no. Lady Marr's. I promised I'd go to Lady Marr's. Hesther! (dramatic music) Hesther. - [Toby] Miss Rissa! Miss Rissa! (sombre music) - I conjecture the fever will return tonight. Care and warmth are still prime necessities. But if efficient care is taken, m'lord, I think she will recover. - You have confidence in the nurse? - I have impressed upon her that constant vigilance is of the utmost importance. (door opening) (light music) (rain pattering) - Hesther. You'll have to go. - You mean you-- You're tearing me out of the house? - Society has been pleased to resent your presence here. Even the prince has made some damned efficious remarks. - You mean Mrs. Fitzherbert. - You may have a new establishment, Hesther, anywhere you please, but discreet. - And alone. - Ostensibly. - Where shall I be without Clarissa's protection? - You will have mine. - Very different, Rohan. - A kept woman. - What were you before you came here? - And Clarissa going off with Rokeby. Is she any better? Is she so virtuous? - My wife is a Rohan. No scandal will be attached to her name. - You mean you'll forgive her? - Forgive is a stupid word. I've already forgotten the incident. - I'm sorry, Rohan. It was just the thought of being separated from you, I couldn't bear. - It's 1000 pities I didn't meet you before I married. You're more to me than I thought any woman could be. But Clarissa is my wife. - [Hesther] I understand. I'll leave in the morning. (romantic music) - Find a house quickly. (dramatic music) (light music) (gasps) - [Nurse] Why, m'lady. What are you about? - I've got to pack. I'm going to Lady Marr's. - Come along, dear. Come along. Get back to bed. There's a love. - Oh, what's this? How could you let her get up? - Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. I only dropped off for a minute. I've been up these three nights. - Oh, you must be terribly tired. You go to bed and I'll sit with her. - [Nurse] Very well, ma'am. Keep her warm, mind. Keep up the fire and call me if there's any change. Here's her sleeping draught. 10 drops in half a glass of water. Good night, ma'am. - Good night, nurse. - [Clarissa] ls that Hesther? - Yes, love. I'm going to sit with you. - I'm so glad. My head is torture. I shan't die, shall I? - No, of course not. You'll be better soon. I'm going to give you your drops. - It's so hot. It's always hot on the island. We shall bathe all day, he says. You can look down through the sea. It's like crystal and see the flying fish and the hummingbirds. Not humming birds. Coral. - Here. Don't talk so much. Drink this. There. - Oh, your hand is lovely and cold. We used to make snowballs at Bath. It was snowing the day you came. It's disagreeable being so ill and thin. I can't go til I pay the bill. - [Hesther] Sh, dear. - Rokeby will pay the bill when he comes. - Hush. Go to sleep. (suspenseful music) What are you doing here? Go away. - But Miss Hesther. I got to stop with Miss Rissa. I promised Master Rokeby. - You know what I told you. You know what I can do. - Yes, Miss Hesther, I know what you can do. - Then go! - Hesther. I thought you'd gone. Stay with me. I feel safer when you're here. It's easy in his arms, safe. Hold my hand. You're so good to me. I've always known that whatever happened I could rely on you. - Hush. Go to sleep. - Tell Miss Patchett to put out the light. (light music) (clock chimes once) (clock chimes three times) (suspenseful music) (window opening) (wind blowing) (rain pouring) (dramatic music) (light music) - [School Girl] She is both lovely and amiable. Even you, Miss, will find her so. - [Clarissa] I'm Clarissa Richmond. Will you have a sugared violet? - [Miss Edge] She is the only girl in this house who will not despise you because you are disconnected and poor. - [Clarissa] You shall share all I've got and then you can't be envious. I always said you wouldn't be a school mistress. Remember? Hesther, you're going to London with me. You're so good to me. I've always known that whatever happened I could rely on you. So cold. - [Rohan] You'll have to go. You're more to me than I thought any woman could be but Clarissa is my wife. (dramatic music) (bell tolling) - As for the Rohan Star, lock it up with the rest of the jewels. It won't be wanted again til my son marries. What do you want? - To tell you I leave in the morning. - Leave? - You were most insistent that I should. - It's different now. - Quite different. I could have remained with Clarissa. Now it's impossible. - Yes. There's some reason in that. We shall have to find you a house. - No, Rohan. That's a position I don't care to occupy. It's better we part. - I won't permit it. - [Hesther] You can't prevent it. - What exactly do you want? - As strange as it may seem, a reputation. - So that's what you're after. Marriage. How can that serve you? Clarissa's friends will see to it that you are not received. - 12 months from now they'll have forgotten. Old scandals are tedious. Still, you'd be very unwise to marry me, I quite see that. I'll go tomorrow. - Very well, Hesther. If I've got to marry you to keep you, then I'll marry you. - Is that a promise? - It's a capitulation. (rain pattering) (tapping on window) - Toby! We thought you'd run away for good. Where the devil have you been? - Master, master. Is the witch done gone? - Witch? Who do you mean? - The maid, my master. She all you say. - What nonsense is this? Come now, who are you speaking of? - The witch, Master. The witch. (fire crackling) - [Clarissa] I am happy beyond words that Hesther has come to live with us. To me, Hesther is the sister that I'd never had. I'm no longer alone for I have with me my closest friend. My dearest, dearest sister. - Rohan. Clarissa would have wished me to do this for her. - Naturally. Let me help you. - No. Not that. I gave it to her. - Ah, something to remember her by. The sentimental side to your nature is a thing I never suspected. - Why not? She was my friend. The best I ever had. - Quite touching. And true. Clarissa was indeed a good friend to you. - I've said so. - And it's the most natural thing in the world that you should want to look after her. No doubt that's why you dismissed the nurse on the night she died. - The poor woman hadn't had any sleep for three nights. - Very thoughtful of you. Of course, that's what she was paid for. - Rohan. You're not blaming me. I did exactly as she said. - Just what was that? - I had to give Clarissa her sleeping drops. - That would make her sleep through almost anything, wouldn't it? Was that all? - I had to build up the fire and wait. - [Rohan] For what? - Well, she had a fever, she was restless. She might have thrown off the covers. - [Rohan] Did she? - I, I can't remember. - You remember building up the fire? - Yes, of course. - You're lying. - Rohan, why do you say that? Why are you torturing me? I may have been careless and gone to sleep. In fact, I did and when I woke up the fire was out. - You murdered Clarissa. You locked the door and you damped the fire and you pulled the covers-- - How can you say that? How can anyone say that? I was alone here, there's not a soul. - You weren't alone. - What do you mean? - You thought you'd arranged it so well. You sent the nurse away. You turned Toby from the door and there she lay. Your friend at your mercy. But you were not alone. (dramatic music) He was there. After you'd drawn back the curtains to let in the night air he saw everything you did. - I don't believe it. He wasn't, he couldn't have been. - He promised never to leave you alone with her. - You believe that slave's brat before me? - Why do you suppose he'd ran away? He knew what you were. Evil. - It isn't true, Rohan. I swear it isn't! - It is one time you will tell me the truth. You murdered her, didn't you? Didn't you? - Yes. Yes, yes! She stood between us and our happiness. I did it for you, I did it-- (sobbing) - You killed my wife. - She was nothing to you. She never loved you, I love you. Rohan! Rohan, listen. - You killed a Rohan. Who dishonours us, dies. (gasps) - You're not gonna inform against me. You're not gonna let them hang me! - I'll not leave that heritage to my son. But you're not going to escape. (suspenseful music) - Oh, Rohan. No. No! No! No! (screaming) - [Auctioneer] Three guineas on bid. 16 guineas for this trinket box and contents said to have belonged to the Lovely Lady Rohan. 17. 18. 19. 20 guineas. Thank you, madam. 20 guineas on bid. Come, come. We can't waste any more time on a small item like this. 20 guineas? Very well. (gavel bangs) To Mrs. B. on the-- - It's too late, it's gone. - Peter, I'm so sorry, it's all my fault. - Of course it isn't. - If I hadn't stopped to have my fortune told by that gypsy. - It doesn't matter. I've got better things to do with my money now. - But you wanted to take something back belonging to the Rohans. - Perhaps I shall. You know, I take back what I said about her yesterday. She has got rather a sweet face. Well, where do we go from here? - When do we have to get back? - Not til tonight. - Then let's get the first bus we see and go wherever it takes us. - Suits me. Wherever it takes us. (chuckling) (dramatic music) - Isn't it a lovely day.
