YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE Brothers and sisters, let's celebrate Our offering will show us how to proceed in beauty Oh, protecting hills of the community we ask your protection Let us toast brothers and sisters Dionisio, son let's make our offerings Thank you Mother Dionisio Do you remember me? You're Aurelio, don Felipe's son. - What's the news from Lima? - It's still there, as always. You know Roger, we are classmates at the university. Of course I know him. We even sat together in school. Do you remember? Of course, Dionisio, how could I not remember! This is Meche, a friend. - Let's greet the authorities. - Yes, Dionisio. - This is the president of the village. - It's a pleasure, Mr. President. The judge. - How much is it? - A hundred. You dropped the fruit. Is the any lodging around here? - Here, there's nothing. - Shall we dance, Miss? I'll take care of it. Go and dance. You should have drunk it even faster. Carnivals are for fun. Shall we dance, Florinda? Come on, let's dance. What happened to your leg? It's a long story. An occupational hazard. How much land do the villagers have? Some of us have only very small fields... not enough to make a living. And if you all worked your lands together? Work together? In this village, each field has an owner. If all the villagers joined together like the fingers of a hand. They'd make a strong fist. My father believes that. But it's very difficult. There are many arguments among the villagers. Your father believes that? The authorities and merchants are making abuses every day. He wants us to command respect.. all the villages together, not just Rayopampa. There is only one way to command respect, Dionisio. Only one way. Hi, Florinda. - Are you going to wash too? - Yes. But you're not a woman. Tou'll see, I'll wash better than you do. The carnival is over. Are you leaving today? We didn't como only for the carnival. Why then? To wash the clothes. No. To get to know the village customs better. For what purpose? I'll explain, when we get to know each other a little better. - We are visiting brothers. - Welcome. Let's drink for the mother earth. Thank you. Good morning, Mama. Good day, young man. Still around, young man? - Good day, Governor. Excuse me, have you gone down to the town? To the town? Why? Tell me when you do, I'd like you to take a letter for me. Hey, Dionisio. These boys are staying too long. When are they leaving? They're finishing their studies, and aren't causing any problems. But when are they leaving? Look, can't you see how they're helping out? You don't know how. Let me do it. Let's go to Dionisio's house. Why? To talk. It will be nice. All right, let's go. Good afternoon. In all these years the village hasn’t solved its problems. Our conclusions, comrades, is that the community should only. produce for its own needs. There is no need to sell anything. So where will we get money? Dark woven poncho from the mountains Walking away from the long cold. The dew is dying It's dying, God help me... Why should we have to feed the city? The villager should only feed his children. We must fight against the exploiters. Selling at a fair price is fighting. The big merchants will never change. That's why my father is organizing a producers committee. So we won't have to sell at reduced prices any more. Suppose your father manages to join this village with others.. perhaps he'll get better prices. And then what? Could just a few more coins be the solution? A different kind of struggle is needed to end... the people's suffering forever. Another kind of struggle? Are you going to let yourself be walked over forever? The land is for those who labour it. Unarmed struggle has never liberated the people. Our armed struggle is a hurricane smashing the old semi-feudal order, to bring forth a new country. One of well-being for the oppressed. But nothing is going to fall from heaven. The people must earn the new homeland with weapons in their hands. Roger, you... all of you... are Shining Path? Yes. We are comrades. But the village doesn't need to know it yet, Dionisio. Nobody must know it. Sing, comrade. Aurelio, she is waiting for you. Dionisio... Luciana... Let's talk. May the dawn never know Tell not the wind ... What were you gossiping about? Well... Tell me about what? Maybe, criticizing me. You're not only beautiful, but curious too? My heart is very red my little dove. Would you like your heart to be red too? Red with love? Yes, little bird, red with love. With love for me? So how long will these students be here? I hope they're not rebels. They're not outsiders. They're sons of villagers. And the woman? It would be better to tell them to leave. They'll leave soon. We should let the army know, The village deserves respect. Why report to the army? We should decide ourselves. The soldiers don't know how to tell, who is who. Then they should leave, Marcelino. It's no like before. You can't trust them any more. If they don't leave, I'll report to the army. Marcelino, have your son tell them... that's the villagers decision. Where are your friends? What about my friends? The terrorists have blown up the police station. The soldiers will surely be along. The village has decided that your friends have to leave. Otherwise, we'll have to report to the army about the students. Have you called an assembly? It’s the villagers’ decision, and you have to respect it. No, that's just Teodosio's whim, isn't it? That's not fair. Fair is what the assembly decides. You don't know what justice is. What's the matter with you? What justice are you talking about? What do those boys want? And that woman? To study. They're students. They should leave! Do you hear me? Right now! If not we'll turn them in. Do you hear me? Why are you leaving? I don't want you to go. Stay! I'll be back soon, Florinda. I don't want to be alone. Take me with you. No, not now. Why? I'll be all right. Don't worry. Will you wait for me Florinda? I'll be back. Passing your door, a mosquito stung me... It drew blood from my heart... Don't hide when we pass. We're warrior soldiers... We don't fear death... Sweat is my shower... I'll tell them the students just left. You said you'd report them only if they didn't leave. Let them be captured and interrogated. What if they're innocent? What if they're terrorist? If they are, they’ll accuse us all of being involved with them. Better not to say anything, to avoid problems. Halt! Good day, Lieutenant. Have strangers passed by? Speak out! Speak without fear, I'm here to defend democracy and to watch over you security. Around carnival time some students came by, chief. Students? Where are they? - I want to see their faces. - They left two weeks ago. Two weeks? Or two hours? Look, neighbor, you made a mistake. You should have reported them. I haven't gone down to town, chief. They've only been here in the village. Do you know what happens if you hide a terrorist? One was born right here, another not far, in Pampacocha. Neighbor, son in law, or son... Do you know what I do? No chief. If I find out that you've been protecting even one terrorist. I'll wipe out Rayopampa. My motto is, either with me, or against me. Are you with me or against me? We always support the authorities. We are hungry. Fix us a meal and something to take on the road. Otherwise you'll be suspected of trying to kill us. Kill you chief? Starve us to death, lazybones. Back off, everyone! Quick, my people are hungry. Yes lord. The lord is in heaven. A piece of meat on every plate! You, there, taste it to see if there's enough salt. Taste it! The bad weed never dies. Just eat, Doberman. You only live once. And you die once too. When they castrated the hog, The sow was saying... It's the best part of you that they are taking... At last! They're gone, students and soldiers. All of them. Now there's no need to worry. Now we can work in peace. Florinda, what's the matter? - Nothing. - It must be because Aurelio left. - You've been with him? - Who says? Recently you've only been with him. Are you his woman now? Are you? Who will die? Which dog do we kill? The collaborator dog. Who's going to do it? They're threatening father. But he's done nothing wrong. Is it Aurelio? No, I don't think so. Who sent you a letter? What's the matter? They're threatening me. Where are you going? To talk to the head of the village. Don't go. Tell me what it says. If you continue to collaborate the people will sentence you to death. Only traitors traffic with the hunger of the poor to feed the murderers You have 24 hours to renounce your post. Go take care of your father, run. Marcelino... The terrorists are here. They've arrived. They're just threatening. Look what they've done to the village! Let's call an assembly, quickly. Fellow citizens! I repeat, we must take down the flag and erase what they've painted. Who painted it? Nobody in the village could be a rebel! They came and left by night. Came? They've returned. The students have come back. The rebels kill anyone who takes down their flag. Still, it has to come down. Or else the soldiers will think that the village supports the terrorists. I need five volunteers to take down that red rag and remove the paint. Report it to the soldiers so they can come and remove it. They're fighting the terrorists. We haven't done anything. They never defend the villages. In an assembly we'll consult with the neighboring villages and defend ourselves, together. By now, they must have been in the neighboring villages too. There's always someone to join with. Sure! But while that's happening and we organize we'll all be dead. As the leading political authority in this village. I'm going to do my duty. And you Marcelino, figure out what you're going to do. Who did that painting? Who raised the flag? If there is a rebel here, let him declare himself. Here, we are all villagers. We'll only ask them to leave. With rebels amongst us, we have no defense. The soldiers will come And for the acts of a few the whole village will pay. They must leave. In the villages there is no room neither for the rebels nor for the soldiers. I thought you'd left. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. The rebels painted the walls last night. - They've threatened to kill my father. - I know. We want your father to resign his post and join our ranks. What? To resign is enough. - Are you a rebel? - Yes, I am a comrade. - You never told me. - You never asked. Go to your father and tell him to resign. You're his daughter, convince him. - You want me to do that? - Yes Florinda, I do. - So that's why you came for me? -Yes, so you'll join the Party. You've only come so I'll join your Party. You don't love me. Yes I do. That's why I offer you the Party. The Party is the purest. It's the best I can give you. A villager is looking for you. Have him come in. Good afternoon, Lieutenant. Look. Thank you. Don't worry, nobody dies before his time. The villagers need to see you are supporting us, chief. The troops are not here to chase after every paper or paint. You have to tear down that red rag and remove the paint. Me? You've been a soldier. Once you've served your country, you're a soldier forever. So go ahead now and stop whining. But the terrorists will kill me. So what? You'd die like a hero, for your country... like Grau, Bolognesi like Alfonso Ugarte. But you'd be a greater hero. A martyr for democracy. Send some soldiers to defend us, chief. The army... The army defends... ... democracy. I am a hero too. Do you know that? Yes, chief. One of these days, I too will wake up dead. No, that's a lie. Let me tell you a story. I'm already dead, The person you see here, isn't me. But it wasn't the terrorists who killed me. When I arrived here and realized what it was like I shot myself in the head. That's why I can do what I have to do and with honor. With my life I paid the price of sacrifice for the country. The same as you. Because you... you're going back to your village. You're going to take down that rag and you'll raise our flag. But the terrorists are going to kill me. Are you afraid of death? Shoot yourself in the head, like I did. After that, you won't fear a thing. You'll be able to do your duty. Don't worry, you won't die. - Do you know why? - Why, chief? You don't know it yet, but you too are already dead. Good bye. Permission to retire. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Who are they? They are rich peasants. They're so afraid, they even leave their fields during the harvest. Julian has lots of land and cattle. He's leaving because the rebels are threatening him. - Are there rebels around here? - Yes. - Why are you afraid? Don't be afraid. Nothing will happen to us. We have nothing. The rebels will let you teach. Come along. We are going to take down that red rag which represents the traitors of our country. We are going to raise the flag of Peru. Teodosio, what are you doing? That is dangerous for you. You have been threatened. Leave it as it is. .. The entire village must do it. The village is worse than a chicken yard. The homeland is greater than the village. This is what a national hero must do. Why haven't the soldiers come? Don't get yourself into problems. Climb up and pull down that rag! Teodosio, let's go home. Bunch of cowards! Climb up there! The penalty of death. The penalty of death for anyone who doesn't help... penalty of death. Now what's going to happen? The terrorist will be back and so will the soldiers. Terrorists and soldiers, sons of the devil. All of them! Long live President Gonzalo... Long lives the people’s war... Down with the snitches... Death to the traitors... Long live the armed struggle... Long live the President Gonzalo... Everyone to the plaza! Quick! Move on! Hurry up! Walk! Hurry up... Move on... Long live the armed struggle... Comrades. From this moment, the village of Rayopampa has become a support base for the People's Republic of the New Democracy. And for this historic event, we thank our guide President Gonzalo. Long live President Gonzalo... Long live the armed struggle... Let me by. Fulfilling the mandate of the people we shall submit to people's justice this dog, this lackey of the old and corrupt order. The comrade will be the prosecutor. He collected food for and collaborated with the repressors. He is a snitch. He did not resign despite a warning from the Party. He trampled on our glorious flag. For these serious transgressions I ask for the penalty of death. Does anyone wish to speak in his defense? The soldiers forced him to collect food. They also forced him to tear down the flag. As an authority, he was only doing his duty. Your defense is worthless. You helped him. The Party has a thousand eyes and ears. Be careful. The Party is watching you. Don't kill him. We don't want any dead. It was his duty. Beat him if you must, but don't kill him. If this traitor's duty is to be a snitch, let him be executed. Fucking terrorists. Traitors of your country. Everyone listen. The authorities must resign. Simeon, you are no longer the local judge. Marcelino, we accept your resignation as the President of this village. We have nominated two delegates to represent the valuable village of Rayopampa. Dionisio Condor, for the production committee and Luciana Huaman for health and nutrition. Comrade, no! I have no knowledge Better name another person. It is an honor to be nominated by the Party. Now all you have to do is to fulfill your obligation. Same with the other delegate. The party has designated, the political leader and the military leader of Rayopampa. God Father, Son and Holy Spirit. You are soon below the earth and will forget us all. Your children are looking for you. You left them alone... God Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Let's pray. Ave Maria... You left your children... Why have you come? To pay homage to the deceased. Pay homage! After you killed him? You told me it was only to threaten him. Florinda, the first death is always the most difficult. Because it's purpose is still not understood. Killing serves no purpose. Yes, it does. You'll understand. You'll learn. That death is like an offering to the mountain to ask for rain. By the blood of Teodosio Rayopampa will flourish. The world is round said Columbus But nobody paid much attention The Queen of Spain, Queen Isabel Gave him the money he needed He travelled... Long live President Gonzalo... Fourth sword of world revolution... The water of Rayopampa is no more. Red with blood is the river. We shall go behind the fog. With tears of rain we shall cook. Halt! Halt! Go back Catalina... I need to bring water to my husband. Go back Catalina. Comrades, we'll share the crop according to the number of children. What do you want? To put a red rag on my house. You can't continue giving a bad example, Papa. We are committed. Better if the village is united. The Party is in charge now. They don't command, their guns do. If anyone disobeys, they get killed like Teodosio. If he hadn't been a snitch, he wouldn't have gotten killed. I didn't raise you to go around killing like they do? This is no good for the village, or anyone else. Attention! To the left. Welcome comrade Meche. Welcome comrade Meche. Long live President Gonzalo... It took fifteen million years for the earth to generate communism. Just now we are about to end a long era of shadows. Long ago the world was split into exploiters and the exploited. Why did the Spanish defeat the Incas? They were a strong nation but corrupted by explotation. Then the peasants began their struggle and later, the workers. Steel was finally forged. But there is no victory yet. Why? Because the light had not yet arisen. But it did in the year 1980. Then, at last the dawn broke, the darkness of fifteen million years cleared. And why so late? Aren't you coming? No. Father... they might... I've lived long enough. Please, Daddy. What are you going to do? There's nothing to do. Just wait. Wait for what? I don't know. Very well, little comrades! What is our President like? He is the purest red, an undefeated communist. He covers the whole world. He shines in the sky. He comes to every humble home. He has the will of steel. Our chief is the sun. He is the highest peak you see. Our chief travels beyond time. Marcelino, now nobody has their own field. The land is for all of us. We'll labor it together. Can't you see I'm laboring my field. Marcelino, I've warned you twice. You know what happens the third time. What happens to those who don't respect the Party. Coward! You deserve this punishment for mistreating your wife. Four more blows. So those who have these bad habits will learn. They'll kill him too. The same as my Teodosio. They will kill them all. All of them. Catalina. No, Catalina. We won't kill him. We're only punishing him for beating his wife. I'm going to look for my husband. He's at home. Catalina. Where's is my Teodosio? Why did you kill my Teodosio? The comrades are coming... A bunch of comrades is coming. They express a burning passion and a rock-solid faith. Gonzalo, the masses call you. The Andes shake for you. They express a burning passion.. The parrots fly out of the jungle... They call to each other... they gather and they come... Just like we do... Long live President Gonzalo... The Party salutes this valuable Support Base of Rayopampa. We have como to reward the children of Rayopampa. They'll join the uncontainable development of our struggle. Wisely guided by our President Gonzalo. Long live President Gonzalo... First the volunteers. Step to this side. Juan, Eliseo and Chuto.. - I ask to speak. - Speak delegate. We need the young ones. We are supporting you. But we can't give you our children. From this moment on, you are part of the people’s war. Let's give a welcome to our new comrades. Long live President Gonzalo... When the troops come remember you are blind and deaf. If not, these dogs will take reprisals against you. And listen, nothing has happened here. I'm going with you. The Party needs you in the village. You better stay. I already spoke to Meche. - You spoke with her? Quick, we're leaving. If anything happens to my children. They have volunteered. Mama, I'll be back soon. Don't cry, I'm a big boy. Don't let anybody see you. What do I tell them? Give this letter to the military. From there go to your sister's. - And you, when they have roll-call? -I'll think of something to tell them. Any day now the army is going to come here and finish us off. They've done it in other villages where there are terrorists. We must convince them that the terrorists forced us. Go now. We'll see each other soon. - Eustaquio? - They conscripted us. What do you want? Good day, Tiger. - Have they killed anybody else? - Only Teodosio. But they threaten everyone. They don't let anybody out. I managed to slip away. Help us, please. Cowards! Sending their women with pieces of paper. So the terrorists are now in charge. It's a liberated zone. Liberated. That will happen when I get there. Aren't we going to bury him? Are you just going to leave him here in front of my house? You point at. Luciana Huaman... Show her to me. When did they kill him? When did they kill him? Yesterday he turned up dead, in front of my house. These miserable people won't even bury your husband. - We've been mourning for him. - But you let him to rot in the street. Luciana Huaman... So you're a delegate for the terrorists? I work selling. I don't know anything. We'll see about that. Dionisio Condor. My husband isn't a terrorist. He went to fetch potatoes. You're his wife? You've fed the terrorists. You've even clothed them. Move, you damned stupid! Are you Dionisio Condor? Tie him up. Who else? Who else? All of them? All... You... you and you. That's all of them. Tie them up. The local authorities must bury him. Where is the head of the village? - There aren't any authorities. - So you obey the terrorists? No, sir. Why haven't you buried him? What is written? "He who buries him dies" Do you obey the terrorists? Do you obey them, or not? What's the matter? Are you afraid of them? Yes, sir. What side are you on? Who do you support? Which side? The side of the village, sir. The village, sir. Not the side of the homeland, not the democracy, nor the Shining Path, not war and not death. "The village, sir!" This time you jackass indian, you screwed yourself. Crecencio is the new Governor. But, boss.. You're in charge of forming a civil defense group You'll report every fifteen days. We don't know about those things. The terrorists are armed. We can't defend ourselves with slings and stones. They'll kill us. You... you ... you... and you'll join Crecencio in civil defense. If you don't, you're dead. Everyone.. Long live Peru... Civil Defense... bury him. Doberman... - Yes, sir. - Do you hear me? This village doesn't even exist on the map. What you see here is a geographical error. This is the spark of revolution. Long live the Marxist-Leninist Maoist- thinking Gonzalo! six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I want us to all work together for this shining future. Be part of a rising fire removing injustice to create a better world. You and many others struggling together, dying together, if needed. Long live the people's war... Our blood will unite to form and flourish a stream of life. Live the spread of support bases... Square, circle... Where are the other students? - They don't come any more. - They're with the terrorists? - This one comes with us. -That child has done nothing. - He could be a terrorist spy. - Let him go, he's innocent! - I'll take him to interrogate him. - You can't just take him. I'm responsible for that child. The tell me something, teacher. What happened to Civil Defense? - I don't know. - You don't know. They killed them, and you don't know. Why is it you're working in a "red zone" and the terrorists do nothing to you? The Ministry sent me here. Saturday you come down to the base to make your declaration. Let's go! Don't look. Don't look. Don't look... You have to get used to it. comrade Cleofé. Aurelio, don't call me that. Call me by my real name. Your combat name is pretty. Cleofé. Comrade Cleofé sounds nice. No, Aurelio. I prefer you call me Florinda. Party discipline, comrade. You should always call me by my combat name. Always! Death to the traitors. Death, death. Death... death. Why does it happen this way? Everything could be done differently. Do you think that we chose this? We are obliged to do it. We have to stand on our feet. The blood of our dead boils in our souls. And the suffering of our families? We don't have families any more. We have comrades. Let's go now. Let's go. Oh, life, oh destiny... I roam the mountains and hills... This was foreseen long ago. We couldn't continue to be all forgotten. But who could know they'd remember us only for this... for death, only death. It's like being condemned. To live with this fear, is worse than death. You can't tell who is who any more. Rebels, soldiers, cattle-thieves, bandits.. Anybody could be one of them. Let's go somewhere else, far away. This is our village. We shouldn't leave. We'll stay. We can't remain in our homes. We can sleep in the fields. We must hide. Hide and sleep in the field. What life is that? There is no village, Marcelino. Don't leave, Porfirio. This situation must pass. If we'd organized ourselves with other villages letting it be known that we permit no one to enter. Maybe they wouldn't have come. It's too late. Now everything is silence. We only have our lives to save. Would you like to return to Rayopampa? One day we'll return to stay. When we win the war. On that day, they say, the sun will burn strongly. There will be no night. We'll be happy without fear. We'll have everything... father, mother, brothers, clothes, food, money. We'll have everything. So they have told me. Gonzalo the masses are roaring The Andes are shaking Revealing a strong passion An unbreakable faith They want a clean war. They want us to loose the war. You don't know who is who. Try to distinguish between friends and enemies, you'll go mad. That's what happened to me. Don't be a fool, Doberman. I've seen you shoot. You're crazy. You tear the dead open with your bayonet. If he isn't dead, I make sure of it. So he'll never wake up again. You see... Terrorists! There is the leader, that bitch! Cover each other. Florinda let's escape. They'll kill you. Pancho! Shoot, right now. Disappear, I haven't seen you. Vanish... run. Lieutenant... don't let me die... Assholes! Can't you hear me? I have a badly wounded man. Come to pick him up! Shit. We'll retreat. Miserable, you'll die. - Where are you from? - Rayopampa. Rayopampa. Filthy murderers. One dies, two are born. Let's go. Take the dead and wounded. Comrades have paid with their lives. their due to the Party, fighting until death. While he... this traitor tried to escape. Abandoning our glorious struggle. He is worth no more than a dog. What does this traitor deserve? The death penalty. Comrade Meche. Speak, comrade Cleofé. The truth is that the comrade tried to escape and deserves his punishment. He fled from the battlefield. He only wanted to see his family. He should review his own actions, be punished and given another chance. It's not relevant. He is a traitor. There will be many executions like this one. We will cross a river of blood to get into power. We can't be sentimentalists, comrades. Our duty is to destroy to survive. What does this traitor deserve, comrades? Death. Comrade Cleofé, we'll test your true commitment. You will be the one to bring this traitor to justice. This execution shall be an example of the Party. You've been chosen to carry it out. Come here. How can I kill him? He is like my brother. Shoot. Fire. You are obliged to carry out the decisions of the Party. Everything must end All suffering too I am singing sadly behind your house. My song is over... Close your eyes, Florinda. My song is... He only wanted to see his family. And you... I want life. That is why I offer my life. You don't love anyone. With the triumph of our glorious struggle, there'll be time for love comrade. By then we'll all be dead. Just like Eustaquio and Teodosio. Like those who died in the ambush. But our blood, united, will be like a river to make love flourish. Love? You speak to me of love? I just killed. What kind of love is that? Everything except power is an illusion. The only real thing is the Party. Don't shout. Go back. Go back... What are you doing? You didn't reach me. Come back, Florinda... Don't flee! All we have is the Party. Come back, Florinda. You won't be able to escape... Catalina... Have you seen my father, my mother, my sister, Honoria? Don't kill him, please. Catalina, it's me, Florinda. Florinda? So pretty, so young. This is not for you. Go, run away. Grandmother... Don't cry, child... Who is it? It's Florinda, Father. Don't go. - She won't kill me Father. - Don't go. Florinda. I have come home to stay. I want to live in Rayopampa. To stay? You can't stay here any more. Rebels and soldiers, both will come to get you. They will kill us all because of you. We will stay. You won't. We'll weed the fields and sow. Rains will come. And there will be another carnival season. Some day Rayopampa will flourish again. On that day, you can return.
