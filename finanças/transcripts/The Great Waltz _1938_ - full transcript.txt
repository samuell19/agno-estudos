In Vienna in 1844 nice people neither danced the waltz nor kissed their wives in public nor listened to new ideas In 1845 came Johann Strauss II and his immortal melodies We've dramatized his spirit rather than facts of his life because it's his spirit that has lived in his music VIENNA KK COMMERCIAL BANK Just a minute, my dear Mr. Strauss... and what's this? A waltz Another waltz, I see Mr. Strauss, your father persuaded me to take you in against my judgment And what's my reward? Every time I turn around, there's another waltz printed on this paper This is all... Don't... you don't You know, those are mine You've got me a 60,000 golden And you've got my waltz And now, get over then... you're fired Join those revolutionaries... they won't go to work either No fuss, no frank than serve in the street to start another revolution Now, Mr. Wertheimer...

Count Hobenfried But you're mistaken There's nothing wrong, I swear I give you my word You know, of course... there's always this rumor Madam, for your sake, I'd not presume for the sake of mine But for his sake, you should stop this at once I've no right in this matter, Madam You're his wife... you have She'll destroy him They'll destroy each other She's the woman of violent feelings... strange whims and irresistible impulses Mr. Strauss is not for the man to cope with this extraordinary person He'll be ruined I beg you Madam, you must face the facts unless you're willing to surrender What I can see is so dear to you You compelled me and controlled me to say what I don't intend to say to anyone You had told me nothing that is not known to me that isn't known to me for some time I lived all these weeks for... the knife in my heart I'm content to live here for his sake It's the better way it must be I'm sure there was anything to be done he'd have done it I'm sure he suffers as much as I do Mrs. Strauss, Madam Donner leaves after the opera tonight for tour of Europe The situation between them... I advise you to act quickly What'd you have me do? Fight What everyone wants to live in this world, he has to fight for... like the beast of jungle This crisis arrives between people even carefree, but profoundly If you want to keep him... if you want to save him... don't leave it in his hands You must fight I thought my love fought for me I thought he needed me and that was enough It's not enough You'll lose... Don't say anymore, Count Hobenfried Will you excuse me? All this humiliation... You never humiliated yourself... Count Hobenfried I've the greatest respect... the greatest Who was it, Poldi? Poldi, what's the matter with you? Who was it? Why don't you say something? What time is it, mother? It's quarter to 10 Poldi, what happened? What's the matter with you? First I dress up Do you think I could get there in time for the finale? But if you hurry, you might But what come over you? Now suddenly you make up your mind You're quite right, mother I'm going, of course... I'm going I have to go Johann offered me not have to go before, was it? Ha... why those people do such a crazy thing? You'd better lie down, Poldi Lie down? There's no time to lie down, mother This is the time to fight... fight to this beast All Vienna knows There's nothing to hide... nothing Help me, mother... quickly Quickly I'm frightened Oh, there's nothing to be frightened of mother darling... There's nothing to be frightened of I'm going to the opera, that's all I'm going to the opera to Johann I knew there's something Love is no good, mother darling... for women like us That's for the other kind... for women who take... for women who steal... for women who have no hearts If you've no other competence, leave it Can't they, mother? My jewels? Where are my jewels? I have as much right to wear my jewels as she From now on, I'll never go out without my jewels Poldi darling, if you really don't want to go to the opera, you don't have to Maybe I upset you Now you're too excited No, mother... I'm not excited I was for a moment, but not anymore The performance won't end without me I'm also bound to... a big part, you know I'm bound to be the star of Johanrs opera, not that woman She is not stealing anymore And in his heart, Johann will be glad Bravo, Strauss The world is at your feet tonight My world is beside me... we belong together I always know it I know it now I'll go with you to Budapest tonight Darling, in 2 hours we'll be in the Danube Oh, Carla... you were wonderful Thank you... hurry How do you do, Mrs. Strauss? Well, what do you think of Strauss tonight? Did you ever see him so magnificent? He's going to Budapest with you tonight Yes, my dear... he's going with me We might as well face it, don't you? He loves me and I love him There's nothing, not anyone can do about it You can't... I can't... he can't Yes, I know that If I were you, I'd have spared myself from this embarrassment I'd ask you to give a message for me I know he won't leave without... without explaining everything That would be difficult for him... for us both Tell him there's no need of it Tell him he's quite free He needs not to worry about me Will you tell him that? You're very unselfish or unexpectedly clever For charity, I like it Believe me, Madam... I know it sounds silly But if his happiness is with you... I think I love his happiness more than I do him You probably deserve him more than I do But he's going with me So don't ever fool yourself to sacrifice again Happiness is in your own heart... not in someone else's I found that out I think you'll feel differently after you've been with Johann for a while You see... Johann isn't like other man If you hurt him, you might as well kill him And you've to watch him carefully... so he doesn't fall off the horse in the street And if you don't take care when he's working, he'll starve to death Poldi Poldi... I want to talk to you They told me you were here Yes, I came here to congratulate Madam Donner Johann, you're wonderful... you both are wonderful Did you see the audiences?

His old white horse Yes... and he claimed it understood everything he said Have you ever been on the Danube? Of course, you have Yes, but not this way, Johann I never have... when we were crazy youngsters We used to stand on the bank and throw rocks on the boat Bad little boys I remember... once the police caught us and... and Poldi cried because she thought...
