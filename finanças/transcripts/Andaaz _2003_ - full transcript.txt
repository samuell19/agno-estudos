Yeah! Come on! Come on! Kajal, pass the ball! Come on! Come on! Come on! That's it, that's it, Kajal come on! Come on! Come on! Hey Kajal, look, your new neighbours have arrived. Get lost! - Kiran, come in. - Yes. [TAXI DOOR CLOSING SOUND] Raj, your new house. Get the luggage. You're hopeless, Kajal. I've been shouting at you to save the goal! The moment she sights a plane, she forgets everything else. - That goal was entirely your fault. - What goal? I won't accept it. - Didn't I ask for time please? - I didn't hear that. - Is it my fault if you were born deaf? - None of us heard it. Get your ears cleaned up. I'm not playing with cheats. But leave the ball behind. God! Look at this girl! Are hockey and football games that girls play? There's no longer any difference between a girl and a boy, grandma. - But where are Mummy and Papa? - Gone to see the neighbours. A professor has moved in. They've taken some tea and snacks for him. - Give us the ball. - Shut up! - You have only one son? - No, he's my brother-in-law. What subjects do you teach in college? - I? - Yes. I'm no professor, Rohit Sir. The only connection I have with the college is that I run the cafeteria inside the campus. Oh! It's like this, the students come to you for classes and to me for snacks. In other words, we teachers make the students tense while you help them relax. Correct? -That's nice. - This is my daughter, Kajal. - Say, hello. Hello dear. Say hello to aunt, my child. - Hello aunty. - Hello dear. Come to me. So cute. - Which class are you studying in? - Class sixth. Okay? Hi, I am Kajal. - Do you have a name by any chance? - Raj. Well... Okay, nice name. Raj. Very good. Will you be my friend, Raj? - What does that mean? - My friendships don't last. My friends usually desert me in a matter of days. - Why is that? - I'm not like other boys. I can't play, I can't run. Well, I'm not like others, either. I'm your friend for keeps. I promise. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Hmm. - Let me teach you to fly this plane. - I wish I could get into this plane. - It's kind of small, isn't it? - You don't know how to fly a plane? I'm small now. Wait till I grow up, I will fly a big airplane some day. - Will you let me sit in your plane then? - Of course. - Friend's promise? - Friend's promise. I've cooked the food. Eat it up and enjoy. It must have taken you ages to prepare so much food. Big deal! Preparing food for one's dear ones is no trouble. - Don't I cook for my wife, too? - You cook for your wife? - If not me, will you cook for her? - No. What I meant was - doesn't she cook at all? - She doesn't. She'd much rather watch films. She goes to the movies every Sunday. - Don't you go with her? - I don't. She prefers my neighbour Ramdas for company. - You must be kidding. - Believe me, I have seen with my eyes. Yesterday I saw it with my own eyes, Ramdas was waiting around the corner. - What did you do then? - Why me? They had to do the things. They looked at each other and smiled fondly. - Then? - I followed them at a distance. - Then? - They went straight to Moti theatre. Bought tickets in black and went right in. - Then? - Why would I leave them? I bought a ticket in black, too, and went and sat behind them. - Then what happened? - Then what? - I was so upset. My mood was ruined. - Why? It was the movie I'd seen on Friday. Boring movie. But I didn't warn them. I thought they deserved to watch it. - Dear GI Joe, you're amazing. - What's so amazing? It was a matter of three hours, and life is short. Right. "What a wife God has given me" "Ramdas Sir gets to go to the movies with her" "while I'm left at home, to cook food" "What a wife God has given me" Strange man. - What happened to Raj's legs? - Nothing serious, really. He met with an accident once and hurt his knee. We gave him the best treatment, but he's psyched now. He thinks he might fall if he tried to walk. That is why he doesn't move without the braces. Doctors say he has only lost his confidence. The day he gets back his confidence he will be able to run and play like other children. [GASPING] We still hope, although it's now two years since the accident. Don't worry, everything will be all right by God's grace. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - Sleep tight. - Bye. - Sweet dreams. - You too. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] It was nice meeting you. Now, please release your hands. Bye. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Good night. - Bye. - Bye. Switch off the signal, the train has already left. Come on. [SONG PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Where are you going, my express train? I'm going to teach Raj skating. - How can he go skating with you? - Why can't he? - Can a blind man watch a movie? - No. - Can the dumb sing? - No. - Can the deaf hear? - No. Can I roam around in a car like a hero? - No. - Then how can Raj skate? Raj can skate. Understood? Hey Ramdas! Good morning, uncle. Good morning, aunty. Good morning. Good morning. - Aunty, has Raj woken up? - Yes, why? - I want to teach the stupid skates. - My child, you know he can't skate. Why can't he? I've just been telling GI Joe that. Must I argue with you too? Give me one good reason why he can't skate? I can't understand you people. I can't do it, no. Look Kajal, I don't know how to skate. - I'm going to teach you, am I not? - But I will fall. Will you stop walking for fear of falling? - But Kajal... - Come on, hold my hand. [CYCLE BELL RINGS] - Kajal, listen. - What? Lame horses do not win races. He already has a broken leg, now the poor guy will break an arm too. Why, he may even break his head. You stupid! You just watch. Unless Raj beats all of you at skating, I'm no Kajal. Come on, Raj. You can do it. Come on, Raj, get up. Come on, Raj. You have to beat them. Come on, Raj. Come on, Raj. You have to do it. Come on, Raj, get up. Come on, Raj. You can do it. Raj, you can do it. Raj. You have to do it, Raj. Come on, Raj. Get up, get up. For the sake of our friendship, come on Raj, get up! Raj, you have to do it. Come on, get up for me. Raj, you can do it. Come on, Raj. Get up. You have to run. Faster Raj. Run fast, Raj. Run, Raj. Run. Come on, Raj. You can do it, Raj. You have to run, Raj. You have to do it! Raj, you can do it! Raj you can run. Faster Raj! Come on, faster Raj. Come on. Run! Raj! Come on! Run! Yeah! [WHISTLE REFEREE BLOW] It's the inter-collegiate football final and the scores are equal. They are on extra time. St John's players are racing towards Sprindales goal. Springdale's Raj Malhotra stopped the ball. Brilliant stop by Raj. Go for it, Raj! - Come on, Raj. Do it for our friendship. - Raj is racing ahead with the ball. Fast, fast. Pass it to me. It's tough to stop the players of the opponent team. - Come on, Raj! - Raj has passed the ball. Pass it, pass it. Tony's aerial pass. Raj has jumped and kicked the ball. Amazing shot. And it's a goal! Raj and team win. Hey! [CROWD CHEERING] Congratulations, Raj. [APPLAUSE] Won't you say something to your friends? Please say something. Kajal. Can I have you on stage please? - I'm not going. No. - Come. [INDISTINCT] Raj? Friends, I'm able to stand before you today only because of this friend of mine. Else, I would still be struggling to walk, leave alone run. She had faith in me and I in her. Even today I remember the day when she coaxed me into running. And from that day, she's been making me run [LAUGHS] whether it is with her love or with scolding. Keep quiet, stupid. So Kajal has more right to the trophy than I have. - Kajal. - Thank you, Raj. [APPLAUSE] Hang on. This Raj is such a duffer. Know why? People generally snatch away the rights of others and here's this stupid guy who hands over his rights to others. Today's victory entirely belongs to him, yet he wants to share it with me. This is one thing I hate about this man. And one thing I love about him. And that's why he's my best friend. May God give everyone such a friend. I'm so proud of him. Let's go. "Sha la la, baby" "Baby, baby, go sha la la" "Sha la la baby, sha la la, baby" "Sha la la baby, sha la la, baby" "Sha la la baby, sha la la" "I dream of him over and over again" "And I know for sure" "I dream of him over and over again" "And I know for sure" "my beloved shall come to me someday" "He'll come one day" "And I shall belong to him" "Lost completely in his love" "I'll belong to him" "I'll lose myself in his love" "Sha la la baby, sha la la, baby" "Sha la la baby, sha la la" "I dream of her over and over again" "And I know for sure" "I dream of her over and over again" "And I know for sure" "my sweetheart shall come to me someday" "She'll come on day" "And I shall belong to her" "Lost completely in her love" "I'll belong to her" "I'll lose myself in her love" "Sha la la baby, sha la la, baby" "Sha la la baby, sha la la" "He robs me of my sleep" "He makes me sleepless all night" "Makes me more and more restless" "He distresses me to no end" "She's different" "I need to tell her" "that I'm crazy for her" "She taught me what love is all about" "For her, I could die" "I know for sure" "My life will be for her" "My heart knows" "My beloved will come someday" "And I shall belong to him" "Lost completely in his love" "I'll belong to him" "I'll lose myself in his love" "Sha la la baby, sha la la, baby" "Sha la la baby, sha la la" "Sha la la, sha la la" "The one who I've set my eyes upon" "she is completely ignorant" "though she is so close to me" "She is special" "He won't find a girl like me" "For all his indifference" "once he looks me in the eye" "he'll never turn back" "He has snatched my peace" "But I'm sure" "She will come to me someday.

Go home and check the accounts. Please go. - Good morning, uncle. - Good morning. - Did you see Kajal? - No. I've been wrapped up with my own problems since morning. GI Joe must have seen her around. - G.I. Joe. - Okay, uncle. - A cutlet? What about my omelette? - I will send it. - G.I. Joe. - Send it fast. I'm in tension, this man ordered an omelette, and I sent him a cutlet - Have you seen Kajal? - She left early this morning. - Where did Kajal go? - Not Kajal, I'm talking about my wife. She went away early this morning, and I know where she's gone - to watch a movie with Ramdas. - So early in the morning? For the morning show. My wife makes me so tense, and you...? Why don't you reason with your wife? Why does she go to watch movies with someone else? Why doesn't she go with you? You think I haven't tried? Do you think women understand? It's not her fault though. Films these days aren't the sort women would want to see with their husbands. [LAUGHS] He is laughing when I'm seriously stressed out. - Shut up. Idiot. What do you want from me? I'm only asking you whether you've seen Kajal around. If not, quit chewing my brains. Yes, I did see her in the campus. She seemed to be quite tensed. - She's gone to the college. Correct. - Which college is open on Sundays? For those who're tensed what's a Sunday or Monday? If the college is closed she may be in the library. One can sit and read a book when he's worried. Strange. Look he's tensed now. So, you know what tension is? A tensed man can murder someone or commit suicide. He can go to jail or hang himself. You understand what I mean? - Shut up! Get back to work. - I can do it only after you get out. This is the misfortune of our country anybody can take another's place. - Where is my omelette? - Oh my God! For an omelette you need to first bring a hen and a cock together. Then you need to break it open, add spice to it and pour it over the pan. Shall I do that to you? Get lost! - What is this, man? One... - He'll come from here. Is today a day of tension? Oh, this omelette! [BELL RINGS] [WHISTLING] - No! Let me go! - I've been waiting for this day. - You deceived me and called me here. - Deceived you? Whatever. All's fair in love and war. Who'll save you? - Hey! - Hey! Stop! Raj! What are you doing? Raj! Raj! Stop it. Raj. Stop it. - Hey! - Get up. - How dare he touch you? - Raj, stop it. - Kajal, get aside. - Raj. Raj! You're trying to run away? Stop it, Raj! Hey! Raj! What are you doing? Leave him. - Come on. - Stop it. Raj, stop it! Raj, look. Oh God! Stop it, Raj! Are you crazy, Raj? Stop it! - Saved! - How dare he touch you? - Stop it, will you? This isn't right. - This isn't right? - So what he was doing to you was right? - But what was he doing? - Where are you going? - Listen to me. - Oh! My God! - You're pulling my pants. God! - I won't spare you! - Stop it, or he'll die. How dare he touch you? You're alone... I'm not alone. Everyone is here! Where is everyone? When did they arrive? They've been with me since morning. When did they arrive, eh? Shit! He ruined the rehearsal of our play. "Sway..." Hey, who is this? "Who's been killed" - Kamal...? - GI Joe! - Are you all right? - I'm fine. - Are you all right? - I'm fine! Fine, really? You aren't even able to say you're fine properly. And you say you're fine? You're not fine, neither am I. Nice makeup! You act so well. "Killed him" - Papa! - How'd I know it was only a rehearsal? - Raj, I will kill you. Shut up! You should've told me it was only a rehearsal. - Why are they fighting? - You shut up! - You! Stop it! - Listen. Listen to me, Kajal. - You've gone mad. Hey! - Calm down. - Listen. - She's hitting me. She hit me. Is this fair? What happened? Did you find Kajal? [CHUCKLES] Yes I did, at the rehearsal. Listen - She beat me up. Why didn't you tell me she was rehearsing for a play? - I told you she was under some tension. - How's tension related to rehearsal? The show is just four days away, and they're yet to perform well. You've beaten the hero black and blue so wouldn't she be under tension? Now you're under tension, too. - Would you like to have a cold drink? - Where's the omlette, man? I rusticate you! Let's do something. When she's under tension, she feels very hungry. Do one thing. Eating will free you from tension. Take some samosas to her, and some pastries too. Let me add some noodles, too. Don't tell her I sent them. She'll only get angry. You know her temper. Now what's happened? What's the matter now? Just thinking. You can never understand women's moods. Some get tense when they're hungry, some get hungry under stress. - Let me tell you about my wife... - Quiet. - Enough. - Shall I go? Serve these. Manish, say your lines. Whether you call it hoodwinking or cheating, Madhu... What's this you're doing? Are you dancing or speaking your lines? - I'm speaking my lines. - Get lost. Rascal. [LAUGHS] Tapan, you try it. Give him the cue, Sweety. - You hoodwinked me here. - Whether you call it hoodwinkin or cheating, call it an apple or grapes, call it whatever you wish... Tapan, is this line in the dialogue? No, this is my own. Original. Original, my foot. Your fury has lost its sting. Eat something, you'll be stronger - and your temper will flare up, too. - Get lost. Sweety, cue, fast. You hoodwinked me here. But everything's fair in love and war, Madhu. Acting is not their cup of tea. Give me a chance. I may not look like a hero, but I can act so well that I can stun everyone. - You're laughing? - When was I laughing? - I saw you laughing. - I didn't. - Are you sure? - Sure. Did the snacks work? How'll it work? See this? And you're asking me how it was? Does it work this way? - What should I do? - If you want to save your life property and honour, get the hell out of here, quick. - I was thinking just that. - Don't think, run for your life. Get out of here before Kajal comes. I didn't get the omelette. Do you have anything else on your menu? Menu? Can't you see? [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Salt and chilies... now lick me. - Lick me up, come on. - Hey what do you think you're doing? Does he think he can escape hiding at home? I will not spare him. Sister-in-law where's Raj? [GASPING] - He...? He's fast asleep. - Asleep, eh? Let me go and see. How dare you sleep now? Get up! Why are you hitting me? Have you gone mad? You hit me all the time. You ruined my sleep! You hit my hero, remember? - It was a mistake. - Just wait. - I'll make a zero out of you. - A bat...? It'll hurt me. You like to hit people, don't you? Now you will do the acting. - But none of my ancestors ever acted. - Raj, I'm very angry. I've not worn any clothes underneath. Shame on you! I'll put them on you! I got burnt. - What are you guys doing? - Sister-in-law... - Sister-in-law, this girl is crazy. - You stupid. Everything's Wajib in love and war, Madhu. By the way, tell me, just who is this Wajib? Raj, now don't act as if you don't know. Sometimes you ask me to act, sometimes you ask me not to. - What am I to do? - Acting. What I mean is, act in a way that looks natural. Okay. - This is reality? - Sweety, give him the lines of last act. - Here, read this. - And read it aloud! This is all because of you. You were mine, you are mine, and you will always be mine. Don't scream! I mean, don't be so loud. Speak from within, please. You wanted me to speak aloud, and now you're telling me to speak from within. You were mine, you are mine, - and you will always be mine. - Oh! God. Who's this? - Darling. - Oh, Raj! - Now what? - Come out! Out! When I said speak from within, I meant let it come from your heart. - Sweety, give him a cue please. - Take it! Promise me, you'll never break my heart. Why just my promise, you can keep my heart, too. Oh man! Now, why are you lying there? Get up, will you? - I don't want to act. - Come here. - And this is one bad interior! - Raj, I said, come here. - Tell me. - Hold my hand. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] Look deep into my eyes. I'm the one who is dearer to you than life. And for me, you'll gladly accept death. I'm the one. Feel it. Feel it, Raj. Come on, Raj. And say those lines now. You were mine, you are mine, and you'll always be mine. Oh Angel of Love, how can I forget such a noble sacrifice? Sacrifice? I don't know. It's a huge honour to be kissed by lips as silken as these before one dies. Fie on those lips that kill. "I have to say this today" "I have to say this today" "that I've fallen in love with you" "I can't bear to stay away from you anymore" "For, I've fallen in love with you" "I love you, I love that attitude" "And that's a secret that I've hidden for years" "I love you, I love that attitude" "And that's a secret that I've hidden for years" "You are the one I talk about" "You are the one who makes me restless" "Every moment of mine is now painted in hues of joy" "I am in love with you" "I am in love with you" "I can't bear to stay away from you anymore" "For, I've fallen in love with you" "I'm in love with you" "Let's leave the world" "somewhere far behind" "Come" "let's cross all limits today" "Let's leave the world" "somewhere far behind" "Come, let's cross all limits today" "What's this high of love?" "I know not where it has brought me" "Togetherness is incomplete without you" "For, I've fallen in love with you" "I have to say this today" "I have to say this today" "that I've fallen in love with you" "I am in love with you" "It's very difficult to stay apart" "It's very difficult to stay apart" "I am in love with you" "I am in love with you" "I am in love with you" "I am in love with you" Death is a prize to be coveted, Madhu. It would have been a punishment if I'd been condemned to stay away from your sweet lips. Now, it's enough my love. It's time for me to go. Don't stop me. - So long then, my love. - Don't go... - Goodbye, my love. - No. - Good bye! - No! - Uncle! - Child. - No! - Good bye. No! [SOBBING] You can't leave me all alone. You can't... My love. Come on, have your milk. - No uncle. - How will you become strong? No. -You keep troubling sister-in-law. Raj, when did you get this call letter from the air force? - Just this morning. - Strange. When did you decide? When did you apply? You didn't even tell us. - And why such a hasty decision? - It was not sudden. You know very well I've always been fond of the air force. Good girl... - Do you have any objections, brother? - Why will I object? Keep in touch after you get there. - You have to look after yourself. - Thank you, brother. Here. All the best. - Take care. - Okay, brother. - I am going to the college. - Bye. Bye. Whose dream are you trying to fulfill? Yours? Or somebody else's? - Who else's, sister-in-law? - Kajal's. Who else's? Have you told her that you love her and that you wish to marry her? Yes sister-in-law, I did tell her once. - Will you marry me, Kajal? - Never. - Why not? - Look at her. She's so lucky. Her husband works in the air force. He can fly her everyday in an airplane. I'll also fly you everyday when I grow up. So propose me after you grow up, stupid. Raj? Raj? - What did Kajal reply? - About what, sister-in-law? Gosh! Did you tell Kajal about your love for her? There's nothing about me that she doesn't know. She knows what I like, what I don't, when I get angry, when I am affectionate, when I go to sleep. She knows everything. - All I got to do is propose her. - And when will you do that? I will, sister-in-law. The very day I become a pilot, I will. I'll fly her in my plane. At 30,000 feet altitude. Amongst the clouds, I'll propose her. Will you marry me, Kajal? Well, well! What are you gossiping? - No gossiping at all. - You must've been talking about me. - No, I was only telling her... - Anyway, I don't care. - Come out fast, I want to talk to you. - To me? Yes, to you. I want to tell you something personal, stupid. Come on. Excuse me, sister-in-law. You... Uncle is great. He says something, does something else. - But it happens quite the opposite. - Keep quiet. How dare you join the air force without asking me? [BIRDS CHIRPING] - It was decided when we were kids. - Still, you should've asked me. You asked me before joining the play? I didn't have to go far away to perform the play. When will you return? - After a year and a half. - A year and a half? No way. Come back in three months. I can't learn to ride a bicycle in 3 months. - How will I learn to fly a plane? - Okay, four months - not a day more. - A year and a half, not a day less. - What will I do here all alone? - You will miss me - write letters, and maybe cry a little. - Cry, my foot! Will you call me as soon as you've learnt how to fly a plane? Promise? - Promise. - Fly the plane over our canteen so I can see you and wave. Agreed? Kajal, it's a plane I have to fly not a kite that I can fly over your terrace or canteen. Shut up! Promise? Okay, promise. Now let's go, come. [BACKGROUND MUSIC] - Listen... - Tell me. Take care of yourself. Eat properly. And don't work so hard that you become weak. And come back soon. Okay? I'm not even gone yet, and you are crying already? Stupid.

No dear, says the teacher. What have you not done? I haven't done the homework. - Raj! Hey, Raj! - Raj! Look! That must be Raj who's flying the plane. There he goes. Very good. - Wow! - My friend is flying a plane. But how do you know it's Raj? I asked him to fly over the canteen. Don't wave! Take your hand inside. Listen to me. Take your hand inside, my pilot! Not green shirt. It's a blue shirt. But GI Joe, it's been only six months since Raj joined the air force. - He can't fly a plane so soon. - He's been flying since childhood. Yes. -Yes, he's not scared of learning. He's very intelligent. Stick your hand out. Raj. Now do a somersault, a back flip. Somersaults, eh? He won't be allowed to even go near an airplane so early. Hey! What do you mean? What do you know about Raj? Not about Raj, but I know the air force too well. - My uncle is an air force officer. - No wonder Raj beat you up. Take it from me now!

I've been trying to contact you - since the last two months! - I'm wearing a uniform! - But you didn't send me a reply! - How would I reply? - I was not at the base. - Where were you then? - I was at the border, flying my plane. - How exciting!

It so happened that the show as a great success. After the show we danced and enjoyed so much, you know. And then I slept so much that I woke up to find everyone gone. Those in the van thought I was on the bus. And those on the bus thought I was in the van. And in the confusion I was left behind. That very day we were to perform at Manali. I didn't know what to do. Just then, I saw a helicopter land on the hotel lawn. - Excuse me. - Yes ma'am? - Whose chopper is this? - Mr. Karan Singhaniya's. - Why? - Oh I was just curious, thank you. Hello captain. Yes? I'm Kajal. I am a friend of your boss, Mr. Karan Singhaniya. Oh! Pleased to meet you, miss Kajal. Karan and I were supposed to go to Manali together. I am doing a show. And he's the chief guest. You must be aware of all this. - Yes, I am. - So will you be here long? - No, I am on my way to Delhi. - Since Manali is on the way. - Do you mind dropping me there? - No, I can't do that. If my boss gets to hear of it, I could lose my job. What rubbish! Don't worry about that, I can explain things to Karan. - But Miss Kajal... - You ought to be delighted. I will talk to Karan about you, and it can even fetch you a promotion. All right. Okay. So I'll bring my luggage. Wait here. Don't run away. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] I won't. My bluff worked. I was on my way to Manali on the helicopter. But what did I see on the way? The pilot was stealing glances at me. Soon, I could stand it no longer. I snapped at him. Haven't you seen a girl before? Sorry. Extremely sorry. - What happened after that? - As soon as I reached Manali - I slapped that Kamal. - Kamal? Who? The same guy you beat up during the rehearsal of the play. But the best part was something else. Guess who was the chief guest? - Who was it? - Karan Singhaniya. - The owner of the helicopter? - The owner was himself the pilot. - What are you saying? - Raj, I got such a shock when the organizers invited him on stage. There he was before me! Miss Kajal. She directed this play. And this is our chief guest, Mr. Karan Singhaniya. I hope you will talk to my boss Mr. Eeshwar Singhaniya. This is foul. Absolute blatant foul. You were having fun at my expense. Couldn't you tell me - you were Karan Singhaniya? - You never gave me an opportunity. What do you mean? Did I stick a tape round your mouth? Oh! My God. I thought you were doing me a favour when you were pulling my leg. No, I wasn't. On the contrary... Anyway. Forget it. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] - I'm sorry I lied to you the other day. - No, you didn't lie. The fact is, you have become Karan Singhaniya's friend. May I ask you a favour? Can I drop you back at Shimla? No, I am not going back to Shimla. I'm headed home, Dehradun. Oh! It's on the way. - Really? - Really. Karan dropped me right here. When the helicopter landed all the boys came running to greet us. Manjit, Anurag, Raman. - Hey! - Everyone was stunned. When I thanked Karan, he said, won't you at least offer me a cup of coffee for dropping you here? I borrowed Manjit's cycle to take him home. - You seem to be the boss around here. - They're all my friends. Is there a special friend among them? I do, but he's away undergoing training with the air force. His name is Raj. Raj. He is my best friend. We've been friends since childhood. He's a great guy. So simple and so unassuming. He's very fond of me. He could die for me. When we reached home, my parents were so surprised at seeing Karan. But he won over everybody's heart. He touched the elders' feet even GI Joe's. Embrace me. He suggested some ayurvedic remedies for grandma's pain in the knees. Gave father some Italian recipes for his canteen. He even helped mummy to make some pakodas. - Here, sir. - Wow son, in so many years we didn't realize we could use the leaves from own backyard - to make pakodas. - No, it's pathodas. - Yes, pakodas. - No aunt, it's pathodas. You know it's made of leaves. (Patta -Leaf) - Here you go. - Absolutely right. - You... - Yes! - Yes. - Wow! On Karan's invitation, Papa visited his house once. He couldn't stop talking about them when he returned. He said they are so rich, and yet so humble. Then, one day, Karan took me to the flying club. Where, all his choppers were lined up. Wow! Tell me, which chopper would you like to sit in? - What do you call that red one? - Cessna 172. - That's the one. - Hop right in, then. In that big chopper he flew me across the clouds. What a sight it was! Really Raj, I had never seen such clouds before. Then he said. - Kajal? - Hmm? Will you marry me? What did you tell him? [BIRDS CHIRPING] What could I say? My heart was pounding. I missed you so much that moment. I thought if only you had been there, I'd have asked you for an answer. - I told Karan just that. - What did you say? That I can't say yes or no without consulting Raj. If I forbid you from marrying him, you won't marry Karan? I won't. Promise. But at least meet him once. He is so nice that you won't forbid me, believe me. Now that I have told you about my wedding, you tell me what did you want to tell me? About your wedding, of course. - When can I meet him? - You mean it? - I love you, Raj. I love you. - Me too. Then we'll meet him right away. Let's go. Come on. - What happened? - I'll go and freshen up. Mr. Raj? - Karan? - Yes. Nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. Come have a seat. Thank you so much. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Kajal talks a lot about you. She's very fond of you. - She respects you a lot. - Yes, I know. My life is in your hands now, sir. Only you can help me. I'm a nice guy, and I come from a very good family. I promise you, I will not let Kajal down. Never. My folks and I will always take good care of Kajal. I promise, sir. Honestly, I dearly love Kajal, sir. She loves me too. As for me, I can't live without her. Honest. If I don't have Kajal, I will die. So please put in a kind word for me, or Kajal will not marry me. For Kajal, I can... It's you Karan! - I hope you aren't bribing Raj? - He doesn't need to. You can't get a better life-partner than Karan. Oh sir, thank you so much. Raj!

Why don't you answer me? Tell me, for my sake please. What do I say? Raj madly loves you. He wanted to marry you. Raj. Tears of joy, you know I'm so happy that... Shut up. Just shut up. Why didn't you tell me before? - Tell what? - That you love me... I never felt the need to tell you. I thought it was plain enough for you to see. -Oh! God. It is rightly said that a book that is too close to your eyes, cannot be read. I'm so stupid. Kajal? - Would you tell me something? - What? Had I proposed you first would your reply have been yes? Why do you ask me now Raj? I won't be at peace till I know. Neither will you after you know. The truth is, I myself don't know. I never thought about it before. And it'd be a sin to think of it now. But don't think that I'd be spared once I'm away. If you hurt yourself, I'll be hurt, too. Remember this much. Raj? The world does not come to an end if a loved one leaves you. And if that makes for an excuse to ruin your own life, that'd be an insult to your love and to the one who has left you. I'm sure you won't ever insult me. Take care of yourself. Get a hold on yourself. Good bye. Stupid. "There's joy in my eyes" "yet my heart weeps" "Oh, what crossroads has love brought me to?" "Yes, it's a secret to endure pain" And as you see. You just cut off the parachute. Raj, your brother and sister-in-law are here. - I'll just come. - Okay. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] - Hi. - Hi, Raj. Hey, brother! Good to see you. Bless you, bless you. How are you? Fine brother. What brings you here? We're on our way back from a seminar. We thought we'd drop in. Tell me something, officer - have you sworn not to come home? - Not at all, brother. - There is so much work here... - Cut the crap. You will come home during the next vacation. Otherwise... We don't like it without you there. Hey! Come on, brother. Kiran, where are the sweets? - In the car. - I'll get them. Left my favorite stuff in the car? - Take him to task, Kiran. - Yes. [SIGHS] Take a seat, sister-in-law. You know Raj why your brother got himself transferred to Nainital? So that you don't have to travel all the way to Dehradun. I know, sister-in-law. He doesn't want you to be reminded of the past and hurt yourself. Yet you make him sad. You neither come home nor reply to my letters. Sister-in-law, all you do in the letters is ask me to marry. I don't want to marry anyone. All right, I will do just as you say but please stop weeping. Wipe your tears. My friends are watching. You won't change your mind, will you, Raj? No more turning back in life. Raj. Here are the sweets. Tell me, have you fixed the date for coming home? I'll be in Europe for 6 to 8 weeks on a Sea-Harrier training, brother. As soon as I return, I'll come home. - Promise? - Officer's promise. That's all for today. Have a nice weekend. No good being in a foreign land all these days. - What do you mean? - We haven't gone sightseeing. - I mean, no women and wine... - He's right. Come on, let's go. - It's New Year's Eve. Must celebrate. - All right, let's go to the disco. - Wow, that's a great idea. - Even the toughest one has ideas! Busted! His little secret has been discovered. - In the car. - Look, dear. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right, people. Move your body. Jiya. - Hey! You want to dance? - No, thank you. Monty, let go. What are you doing? - Come to Monty, Jiya. Let's dance. - Get off me. Leave me. - I'll just freshen up and come. - Okay. Same for him, please. What are you staring at? Haven't you seen a girl booze? - Actually, I don't usually drink. - Thank you. But today is New Year's Eve. So I thought I'd live it up. I'd try something new. By the way. Happy new... I am so sorry. You see, tonight. I am so sorry. What are you doing? - I am sorry. You see. - What the hell are you doing? I'm slightly drunk. When I drink, it hits me very fast. Aren't you stoned? - A torn pocket! - Excuse you. What the...! I suppose you don't know this is in fashion these days. - Excuse me. It's an Armani jacket. - It's now a typical Sindhi jacket! - Hey! Come on. - Listen. Listen, please give me your residence number, telephone number, everything. - Never mind. - Let's go. Mr. Never Mind, give me your address. I will send you a jacket. Lay off, Monty. Monty your dad may be my father's business partner but that doesn't give you the right over me. Let me go! Get off me. - Or I'll smash your head. - Try hitting me. Monty leave... get off me I said. Hey! Hey! People please. People cool it! [GUNSHOTS] - You! - Calm down. Stop it! Stop it! - Come on, get the hell out of here! - Where are you taking me? Listen to me... what are you doing? What's next? - You got a car? - Yep. Yep. - Where's the car? - Yep. [SIREN] Where's the car? I don't know. Where's the car? Where's the key? [SIREN] Keys? Are you drunk? I think you're drunk. - Why? - Because when there is no car - what will you do with the keys? - All right. Just give me the keys and I'll find your car. How boring. Take this. But I am not. Yay! Got it. Come on. Wow! I must say you are intelligent. Both, brave and intelligent. You're not drunk either. Unlike others, who get drunk easily and lose their senses. Excuse me, where do you think you're taking my girlfriend? I'm not your girlfriend. I am going with him. What? Hey you, Torn-Pocket! Come on man. Let's fight. The winner takes Jiya with him. Come on. You win. Take the girl. - Hey! Fight, fight, fight. - Hey! Come on. - Fight. - Fight like a man. Come on. - Who's this soiled-shorts? - It's spoilsport! Spoilsport! That's right! Never mind, darling. -Okay. [HUMMING] I'm off... - Jiya, take it back. - What to do? - Get back. - Jiya. Jiya, take it back. Bye, Monty. Bye. You can be my hero, baby. Yay. - Madam, where do you have to go? - Wherever you take me. Tell me your address. Oh yes. Go straight, straight... - Jiya! - Drive straight. Straight. I'll get you. [HORN HONKS] Monty! My brother is here! - What are you up to? Stay down. - Let go. I am flying. Let's race. Come on, come on. Jiya. - Brother Monty! - Stay down. You'll fall. Faster. Faster. - Hey! That's my girlfriend. - Come fast. - Come on. - Sit down. - Brother Monty is here! Brother Monty! - Jiya! What fun? New years eve. Yay! Stop the car. Where did he go? Shit! Hey! Speed up, brother Monty. You, here! Damn you! Hey! What are you doing, man? - Sorry, sorry. - Man, You bumped into my car. - Stop it! - You! Brother Monty is punctured! Where do you want to go from here, Madam? -Right... Straight. Yay! Left. We're here. Madam, listen to me. You'll fall. - Where's your house? - It was right here this morning. - Here? - The flood might've drowned it. Goodbye. You're not only brave, intelligent, you're handsome too. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Oh! God. "Too much drinking is bad for health." "You didn't seem to remember the way to your house" "so I brought you home." "Your clothes were wet, so I helped you get into mine." "Or you could've had pneumonia" "I washed your clothes in the washing machine" "ironed them, and there they are. Hanging to your left. Take a look." "There's milk, bread and butter in the refrigerator in case you're hungry." "Don't use the toaster, you might get an electric shock." "Your car is parked outside, and the keys are near the computer." "Goodbye. Raj." The handwriting suggests he's very intelligent. Hey, girl. Look at the size of the shirt. He seems so tall. - Tell me, how does he look? - Very handsome. - Oh! My God. - Thank God! We came in the nick of time. Otherwise you. -Hey! - Tell us, what else did he do? - Nothing at all. - Nothing. Must've kissed you. - No, he isn't that type. How can that be? He changed your clothes, yet he didn't do a thing? - Nothing. - How would you know? - Completely wasted. - Oh! Shut up. - Such boys are rare these days. - I'd have married him. Why not me? By the way, thank you for your suggestion. - Jiya, you must thank him. - Yeah. - Good morning, sir. - Yeah. Bouquet for Mr. Raj. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Thank you. After coming home, I realized that I'd forgotten something very valuable at your place. If you find it, please call me on this number... 6399400 Jiya. Now what has she forgotten? Hello? I'm sorry, there's no jewellery of yours here. There could be something much more precious. - What do you mean? - I couldn't even thank you properly. I want to meet you to express my gratitude. Not necessary. You've already sent me a bouquet. You've expressed your gratitude. So forget it. Okay? It takes one last rendezvous to forget things. - Will you please come home? - Look, I have no time. Bye. Hello? No problem. I'll get you, baby. - Hi, boys. - Hi! - Would you please carry on? - Carry on. - Hey! Hey! - What's your problem? What's your problem, man? Are you dumb? Shortsighted? - Wait a minute. Excuse me. - Yes? -What do I look like? - You're so beautiful. - Thank you. Hear that? And you don't believe it? Excuse me. What do you think I look like? Very sexy. You lucky bugger. - Hey! Whom did you call a lucky? - Hey! Some call me sexy, others call me beautiful. How come you don't see it in me? Are you blind? Or, do you have a problem? Listen. I don't have time for you. - But I can wait. - Then keep on waiting. - Hi. - Hi. Ask me how pretty you are, how sexy you are. How'd that moron know? - He's not a player, after all. - It's connoisseur! I know, it's something like that. The geometric conic can be mathematically modified by placing the parellels using the orthomorphic formulae. Instead of placing them at a constant distance. This should produce a quick automotive projection. But as you all know that in our training we are primarily interested in... God. -As I was saying, that in our training we are primarily interested in the automotive... on the 2 standard parallels... Pay attention, boys. As i was saying on the 2 standard parallel... - Raj? - Yes, sir. - Go and solve the problem. - Right, sir. Hi. - What do you want? - Just one date. - Why? - It's my birthday today. Won't you come home for dinner? We'll eat together. - Please. You will come, won't you? - Okay. - My place! - No touching. Sorry. - All right, I will come. - Oh thank you... - Enough. - Sorry, sorry. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. It's my birthday. Yes! [DOORBELL] Hi. I hope I didn't keep you waiting. I wouldn't mind waiting forever to catch one glimpse of you. I hope you have no more complaints? I wouldn't dare complain about you. If you wish to betray me, go ahead and do it. But I've put my heart and soul at your feet. Be my God of Love. [THUNDERING CLOUDS] It's a power cut. I'd better leave. -Never mind. The electricity will be back. Do not grieve over the lights that are put out. My eyes shall burn all night. Why do you wish to play with fire? You will burn. I'm but a lump of wax. Consume me turn me into a fireball. Let the warmth of your breath spread all over me. Burn me to my soul. Shower on me... let my thirst of years be quenched. "Tonight, the showers will be fun" "Our sweet meeting will be fun" "Tonight, the showers will be fun" "Our sweet meeting will be fun" "I had been holding myself back" "I had been holding myself back" "The moment you gazed at me, I lost my composure" "When our eyes met" "robbed my very being, oh stranger" "Amazing is a beauty drenched all over" "Her body, bedazzling" "Amazing is the monsoon" "And the showers make you sweat... it dazes me" "The passionate urge on my lips" "is to quench your thirst, my love" "When the clouds burst to shower down heavy drops" "my beloved, an urge to embrace you overcomes me" "Your ways, oh cruel one" "Your ways, oh cruel one" "makes me lose my patience" "You set your eyes upon mine" "and robbed my very being, oh stranger" "Hold me in your eyes... wait no more" "Bridge this gap... wait no more."

But only in my dreams. - You girls scared him off. - I don't think he's interested. Forget him. [SIGHS] I'm not the one to forget. I'll get you, baby. Hi, everyone. How are you? Where's Raj? [BIRDS CHIRPING] Why's everyone so quiet? Where's Raj? Where's he? Do you expect us to reveal our friend's secrets? - What do you mean? - You want his friends to save him? - Let him down, Raunak! - I know. - Some kind of... where did she go? - Raj. If you insist, I'll tell you. Raj has gone to India. - He's gone to India. - India? Why? Had some work there. But if I can help you in any way, do tell me. - At your service. - Shut up. Raj. - Has she left? - The disaster you couldn't avert for days, I saved it off at one go. This week's training is relaxed. It takes an ass like me only one shot to hit the target. Very good, dear. For the first time you got the idiom right. This is London's Buckingham Palace, and this is... - Papa, uncle is here! - Shelly! Shelly! Hey, Raj! How are you? - Hello, brother. - Wow! Uncle, what have you got for me? Won't you come to me? How are you? -See Mummy, what a nice doll uncle has bought for me. - It's beautiful. - I'm famished. I'll take a bath. - Serve food quickly. Okay? - I'll serve it right away. - Raj. - Yes. Don't go upstairs, you take this room, here. - What have you done to my room? - You know we've kept a paying guest. - A paying guest? Why my room? - Raj, that room is always locked. Your brother goes to college, while I give tuitions. Shelly used to feel bored at home. But now she has got good company. She isn't just good, she's great. You'll be stunned. Good, Shelly has got company... Greetings. It was only an expression. That doesn't mean you keep gaping at her. [CHUCKLES] Raj? - How did you reach here? - I first took a flight. Then a train, a bus and an auto rickshaw. I can't tell you, but it was quite a bumpy ride. - So you know her? - Yes brother. - I know this girl very well. - Very well, my foot. You returned to India even before you could get to know me, didn't you? Hardly matters. Now that you'll be living together - you will get to know each other well. - Right, brother. - She calls you brother? - So what? God bless you. She's a very nice girl, Raj. Despite staying abroad for so many years, she hasn't forgotten our culture and traditions. She has won us over. Culture! She could sell this country off! [HUMMING] - Why have you come to my house? - I came to meet you on the pretext of returning your shirt. I lied to your brother... Oh! Shut up! Just shut up! I don't like these tricks of yours. Understand? But sister-in-law likes not only my behaviour, she also likes me. That's because she's yet to meet the real you. Shall I tell her in what condition I found you at the disco? Stoned! Sure, tell them. Also tell them that you carried me to your room took off all my clothes, laid me down on your bed - and God knows what all you did to me! - Shut up! I was drunk. All you gave me was this shirt to cover my body. I can prove it! Sister-in-law! Aren't you ashamed? Don't you care even a wee bit about your honour? Kid, my honour lies in yours. Airport. - If I lose it, you will lose it too. - Lose what, eh? - Give me my shirt. - Raj? Raj...? - What's going on here? - Nothing, I was... Excuse me. You're leaving your shirt behind once again. Excuse me. How about leaving my dress behind? Insolence! Take that. Come on, let's have tea together. The potato and cauliflower dish is great, Raj. Sister-in-law, give me some more. Else, he'll lose his temper for no reason. Here you go. -I just love this rumaali roti. I really missed it. Why don't you get married? You can have rumaali rotis everyday. Listen, you were supposed to find a girl for him. What progress? I'd find a girl for him today itself. But will he marry the girl I choose? Why won't he? Won't I break the moron's legs? I will, on one condition. She should be a great cook like sister-in-law. Raj. For your kind information. Jiya was the one who cooked today. - So you are out uncle, clean bowled? - Eat quietly. Children don't talk while eating. Sister-in-law, is this some lentil curry? There's no salt in it. Why don't you check it out for yourself? [BIRDS CHIRPING] Miss Jiya. It seems there's no one. Where's my book? "The rains are going to be fun. Our romantic meeting" [HUMMING] Hey you! You were secretly seeing me, weren't you? Say yes or no. - I didn't see a thing. - You did. - I saw nothing. Okay, I'm sorry. - Sorry won't work, mister. - Well...? - Say that you like me. - But I didn't see anything. - No? Then see now. - Miss Jiya, what are you doing?- Raj. Sister-in-law is coming. Shall I tell her that you were watching me bathe? - What? - I didn't see anything. - I even apologized. - Nothing doing. Say you like me. - No. - No? I do, I do. - Yes? Or no? - Yes. If yes, say lovingly that I like you. - Yes, I like you.- Raj, where are you? - Sister-in-law is coming here. - Where do I hide? - Here. - How can I hide there? Come on! Hold the towel. [KNOCK ON DOOR] - Jiya... - Yes sister-in-law? - Have you seen Raj anywhere? - No sister-in-law. Isn't he in his room? He's not there, he's not even downstairs. Then, he may be behind the towel... I mean, he may be in the bathroom. - All right, I'll check. - Okay. - What happened? - I couldn't even breathe. Finally you accept that you like me, don't you? So, did you enjoy that? - No. - No? Then try again. Insolence! It was because of sister-in-law that I came under pressure. Under pressure, or under threat, at least you accepted? Insolent girl! I'll get you, baby. - One minute. - I want to eat Roshan's snacks. Let's go. [BIRDS CHIRPING] You Towel Girl, get off! You're not going with us. - Get off! - I'm not dying to go with you. But sister-in-law asked me to fetch some things for the Karva Chauth festival. Well, if I don't, it won't rent the skies. But sister-in-law won't complete her fast, she'll remain hungry she'll lose her temper, and take it out on her husband. And they are going to brawl. - So what? Why do I bother? Bye. - Get lost... - Jiya, you guys haven't gone yet? - Sister-in-law, Raj doesn't want... - Come, sit. - What did you say? Come madam, sit. Let's go and do some shopping. -So sweet. Mummy. Bye. - What are you doing? - What am I doing? - Take your hands off! - What shall I hold then? Hold your hips. If I don't hold on to you, I may fall down. - So fall then. - If I fall, we won't buy anything. Sister-in-law won't be able to complete her fast which may result in a brawl. - And if husband and wife quarrel... - For heavens' sake, quit blabbering. Always rambling. Just shut up. [HUMMING] Get off. These types don't get off easily. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Lay off. Go, do the shopping. Move it. Ouch! [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] What are you doing? Hey! Come out. Come on. Hey! You're eyeing our target? Go away. - Madam, they are gone. - Thank you so much, brother. - Shall we...? - Where to? We were going to Delhi, but you stopped us. Come on, let's enjoy. How dare you touch me? You dog. - What? Dog? - Stupid man. You bitch. Take her! Come on. - Raj. - Put her inside the car. Uncle, sister... They're abducting me. Raj! - Let go! Let go, I say! - No. I say, leave me. - What's your problem? - You think you are a hero? Get lost! Come on take her, guys. Yes. Hit him. Sorry. Sorry. Please. Very good, uncle. Very good uncle. Very good. Wasn't it great? - Uncle... - Hey! You misbehaved with her? Why did you misbehave with her? Rascal! Stop your uncle. Or my friend will be a dead man soon. If you want to hit, hit me. - Leave him. - You love to tease girls, don't you? Uncle, he'll die. Stop it. - Pick him up! Take your father away. - Lift him quickly. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] I know you love me, or why would you fight for me like this? - Tell me, yes or no? - Shut up. Just shut up. It's not funny any more. Because of your disgusting behaviour that guy hit Shelly. Anyway, no good telling you. You're not the sort who'd understand. You care not for your own honour nor for that of others. Go, get your shopping done. Do something worthwhile for a change. What nonsense! There's a limit to everything. Get lost. [CICADAS CHIRPING] Out! - Why did you do this, Raj? - It was right, sister-in-law. - She was making fun of traditions. - Not she, you made fun of it. - But sister-in-law, she.... - She was observing the fast, too. Hungry and thirsty since morning. And you flung her plate of worship? Married women observe these fasts for their husbands, sister-in-law. Yes. Also, women observe these fasts for the men they accept as husbands. Jiya asked me before observing the fasts. Sister-in-law, you don't know this girl. She has been after me for sometime now. - She's an eccentric. - Enough Raj, enough. We know everything. She has told us everything. You lied to her that you left for India. She travelled halfway around the world only to see you. She's not eccentric, Raj. She loves you madly. - But brother, I... - No buts, Raj. You promised to marry the girl of my choice. Jiya is my choice. No, this can't be. Raj, why not? I agree you didn't get the girl you loved. But that doesn't mean you should spurn other's love. What's wrong with Jiya? She's madly in love with you. Mummy, sister. - I'm leaving, sister-in-law. - Jiya? Bye, brother. Jiya. -No brother, I don't want this home to break up because of me. The few days I spent with you were just great. I can never forget them. Please forgive me if I committed any mistake unknowingly. I suppose I was trying to achieve what wasn't destined for me. Bye, sister-in-law. - Bye, Shelly. Take care. - You too. Papa. Your uncle is hopeless, my dear. - Sister. - There's lot of poison in his mind. Stop my sister. It is said that those with broken hearts don't break others' hearts. That isn't true at all. Jiya? Raj, please don't tell me any such thing that I won't be able to bear. Stop. Will you marry me? Say yes or no. Here, drink some water. "Love is an illusion, they say" "So I held my feelings back" "Love is an illusion, they say" "So I held my feelings back" "I wanted the one whom I love to love me" "The thought of it rendered me sleepless for nights together" "Allah forbid!

I can't even tell you. Here we go. Oh! God. Where is everyone? Ram Singh, what happened? - Madam, daughter-in-law... - What? Oh! My God. Hold her. Come on. - No. - Hold her tight. - Kajal. - Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law, control yourself. No! Hold her. Come on. Get me the injection. Now. Yes. Just one second. Just hold her. Doctor Sharma. You go with her. The treatment will continue. Mr. Singhaniya, this is the third time your daughter-in-law has tried to kill herself. Had the nurse on duty not seen her on time, we would've lost her this time. - What are you saying? - I'm sorry Mr. Singhaniya if things go on like this, we will have to send her to the mental asylum. Asylum? For the moment we will keep her in the ICU, under observation. Pray that she becomes well enough to take care of herself and that she doesn't do this again. Kajal, your sister-in-law has been my friend since childhood. My best friend. Never even in my worst nightmares did I foresee her in this condition. I met Karan. I met Karan once. Nice guy. She loved him very much, madly. Yes, my brother loved her, too. They made such a beautiful couple. I guess someone's cast an evil eye on them. - What had happened? - Two months after their marriage brother and sister-in-law were going to our farmhouse in Rishikesh. When their helicopter crashed into River Ganges. My brother died on the spot. But sister-in-law survived only to live a life worse than death. She was in coma for four months. When she came around and learnt that brother was dead she was petrified. Ever since, she has been like this. All she wants to do is end her life. She feels she is responsible for my brother's death because it was she who forced him to fly the helicopter in bad weather. We did try to explain things to her, but she's been inconsolable. She will listen, she will definitely listen, now that I am here. And I promise you, I will bring her back to life. She's resting. Let's go. [BEEPS] [DOOR CLOSING SOUND] Sister-in-law, look who is here to see you. Hi. Is this any way to meet your friends? No hi, no hello, no stupid. Hey come on, talk to me, buddy. Kajal, say something please. Talk to me. Come on. Raj. Why doesn't she talk, Jiya? She will die if she doesn't talk. The pain has hardened her heart. We must melt it somehow. - Enough, I don't want more. - Monty, you are here? [CICADAS CHIRPING] Jiya, you've come all alone? Where's Raj? He's in the hospital with Kajal, Mummy. - All right. - With Kajal, why? -Uncle, he's Kajal childhood friend. Is that so? And I thought he's your friend. Monty, he is my fiancé, and Kajal's friend. Oh yes, I remember him, singing and dancing at Karan's marriage. You were in the US preparing for your exams. Karan introduced him to me as Kajal's best friend. Remember what you said to me once? The world does not end when a loved one goes away. [BEEPS] You also said that if somebody uses that excuse to ruin his life he not only insults his love but also the person he loves. Now here you are Kajal, doing that very thing, insulting Karan. Think. If Karan were around, would he be happy seeing you in such a state? Kajal? Kajal. Kajal, you wanted me to become a pilot. I have become a pilot now. Look at me. Do you remember I had promised you to fly you across the clouds? So come on, let's go. Let's get ready. Let's catch the bloody plane. Let's touch the sky. We'll take our plane up into the sky, where visibility is almost zero. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! And we'll perform aerobatics. After the strapping, we'll speed up and climb higher. We'll slowly climb, 10,000 feet... 20,000... 30,000 and 40,000 feet! Then we'll plunge down! We plunge down, splitting the clouds as our hearts begin to race. We leave the sky behind as the earth looms larger and larger before us. Our speed suddenly shoots up. We try to control the lever but the machine springs out of control. Mayday! Mayday! Roger. Roger, mayday! Mayday! Our plane is out of control and we continue to plunge towards the earth. And in a flash, our plane hits the ground! Kajal! The plane shatters. Everything comes to an abrupt end. - No Karan! - Everything comes to an end. - No! - Kajal! Control yourself. - Listen to me, Kajal. - My Karan will die. - Kajal, listen to me! - Karan! Control yourself, Kajal. Control yourself. -No! Kajal. Kajal, look at me. Kajal, control yourself. Look at me. Look at me. I say, wake up. Kajal, be brave. My Karan! My Karan! Kajal, easy. Be brave. No. Let me cry, Raj. Until now I did not have a shoulder to cry on. Enough. Why did you come, Raj? To save me? But my life isn't that precious. To me, my friend's life means more. Control yourself. Everything will be all right. I'll take you out. -Madame, juice. Thank you. So now, I assume, you will take care of yourself. You will, won't you? You're a wise and clever girl, Kajal. What will I make you understand. You know that those who die never return. It's wiser to forget them, don't you agree? We can't guard or check our memories, Raj. Tell me, were you able to forget me even once? [SIREN] [TYRE SCREECH] Yes, doctor. -Check the records and meet me in the operation theatre. Okay, doctor. Hello, Jiya. - Oh! Hi. - Good news. She's much better now. Though physically, she's still weak, but she will pick up. - Thank you, doctor. - By the way, she is not in her room. She is in the garden down there. Thank you. - Hi, Kajal. - Hi, Raj. For you. [BIRDS CHIRPING] You don't look good on this chair at all. Do you remember our childhood days, when I needed braces to walk around? And you used to say, get up Raj, come on, run for my sake. And I ran so fast. Remember? [SIGHS] Come on, I tell you, hold my hand. You know I won't let you fall. Come on, hold my hand. Come on. How did you come to know about me? Your brother must have told you. No. Who then? Call it coincidence if you like. I'd come to meet Jiya's parents. - I'm going to marry Jiya, you know? - What? Then what are you standing there for, stupid? Come into my arms. You have really pleased me today, Raj. I'm very happy, our Jiya is very lucky. - Hey Kiran, where are you? - Coming. - What's up?- C for Cat. There's an excellent news for you. Mr. Singhaniya called to say that soon he will get Raj and Jiya engaged. That's great news. Know what, Kiran? Jiya is our Kajal's sister-in-law. How does such a big world become so small sometimes? - Destiny. - Madam, your medicine. - What medicine are you giving her? - She needs sleep badly. And without these pills, she doesn't sleep a wink. Why won't she sleep? She will now. And she will sleep tight without these wretched pills, all right? - Yes, sir. - Okay? - Go. - Okay, sir. Come on, I will help you to sleep, come on, get up. Slowly. Very good. Can't sleep? So you can't sleep, eh? Want me to sing a lullaby? Sing, Raj. "From the bottom of my heart" "I pray" "may I be kept awake" "while you be given sleep" "May your lips smile forever" "May God bless you with happiness" "May not sorrows ever touch you" "What breaks and then joins again brings music into one's life" So? Do you see what I see, Jiya? I see more than what you see, Monty. Well... you've probably heard the tale of the tortoise and the rabbit. The tortoise wins only when the rabbit goes to sleep. Of course, it'll do me good. Don't worry Monty, I won't go to sleep. Excuse me. It has been an amazing recovery, Mr. Sahay. Ms Beena, enough. Thank God, our child is better now. That's one thing to be happy for, and not sad. Yes Mr. Sahay, for our child's healing we really owe God our gratitude. We must also thank our to-be son-in-law. Mr. Singhaniya, he may be a son-in-law to you but to us, he has always been like our own son. Uncle, I think we should take Kajal somewhere out to Dehradun, perhaps. The change of atmosphere may do her a world of good. My word. Since there's still some time left before Jiya's engagement do allow us to take my daughter Kajal with me, for a few days. But we need to consult the doctor. The doctor himself suggested to Jiya that we take her out somewhere. - Right, Jiya? - That's right, papa. In that case, I don't have any objection. Thank you, Mr. Singhaniya. Where's GI Joe? "I have lost my sleep, my peace of mind" "In your love, look what's happened to me" What's happened? Shall I tell you? There's great news. Last night, there was a lion's wedding in the jungle. Lions and lionesses came from everywhere to attend the party. There was a mouse too, and he was lying in a corner, stoned. A lion hollered at him and ordered him to step out of the cozy corner. And the mouse replied, Hey, quit shouting at me. I was a lion once before I married. But GI Joe, tell me, why have you come so late? Yeah, why am I late? You won't believe me. My wife locked me up inside. She warned me with dire consequences if I attempted to step out of the house for two hours. - Why? - She said the municipality van had been roaming the town to catch stray dogs. You're laughing? Tell me, am I a dog? I learnt afterwards that she had gone to the circus with Ramdas. - Help me prepare my will, please. - Talk something auspicious. What auspicious will I say? No good. One day I have to die. Do promise me that after my death you'll get my wife married to Ramdas. - But why Ramdas, and not someone else? - Because I want revenge. And the best revenge, they say, is to get one's foe married to his wife. There's a world of difference between a girlfriend and a wife. When she locks him up for four of hours then he'll realize! Ramdas! - GI Joe... - Yes? I know, you don't have a wife, neither is there a Ramdas. GI Joe? Father? All this while I've been making the whole world laugh with one lie that I have a wife. But today I failed to amuse that child. Unless I bring back happiness into her life I'm no Girdhar Inder Jaunpurwala. [BELL RINGS] Pinky? Stupid. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Not you. Stupid. - I am here and you're talking on phone. - This Rohit. He's troubling me. You know? Here you are. Your favourite coffee and your chocolate biscuits. - Have them. - Thank you, papa. God bless you, my child. Your friends are here. - Hi. - Kajal, how are you? - After such a long time. - Hey! - Hi. How are you, Kajal? - What are you doing here? We're here to meet you. How are you? Don't you get food in your house? You come here for free tea and snacks. I don't know who informed you about Kajal's arrival. Why are you staring at me? I didn't call them. Did I call you? - Did I call you? - Yes. We'll meet after a short break. Kajal, you've come at the right time. Our college has organized a golden jubilee festival. Yes, Kajal. It's going to be a grand function. And we'll be enacting the old play. Remember? - And you're going to direct this play. - Yes. No. Don't drag me into this. - Please. - Who's dragging you? Look. Kajal doesn't have time. Don't talk of any play. What play? The same play where he was beaten up like a dog. What was the name of the play? - Love and God. - Kajal, you have to do it. Be a sport. Please, Kajal. Yeah! - Please. - Do it. - Come on, Kajal. Do it. - Please, Kajal. Yay! Fie on those lips that kill. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Death is a prize to be won Madhu. Punishment is what... - How does the line go, Sweety? - What are you doing, Kamal? When Raj used to say these lines, it used to rent our hearts. Remember? - If only Raj was with us today... - Really? Here I am. - Hi Raj. - Hi. - Welcome, welcome. - Hi. Raj, you? How come you are here? - You too tell her I called you over. - You did, of course. - I called you? - Raj, please do that last scene for us. Now, I'm so tired. Quit acting pricey. Kajal will have company, too. Come on, please. Please do it, Raj. Okay, fine. Come. Wow, that's more like it. Come on, start. Action! Oh Angel of Love, how can I forget such a noble sacrifice? Sacrifice? I don't know. It's a huge honour to be kissed by lips as silken as these, before one dies. Fie on those lips that kill. Punishment for which is death. It would have been a punishment if I'd been condemned to live and live far away from these sweet lips. I can't hold back anymore. - I can't. - These lines are out of the script. Death comes but once, so does life. So, why are we ruining our lives? Why are we living separately? Why are we tormenting each other? I can't live without you. I can't, Kajal. I love you very much, Kajal. I love you dearly. "Lord!

You're crossing your limits. - This is a sin, Raj. - No sin, Kajal. It's love. Raj. -I love you dearly, Kajal, and I wish to marry you. Stop it, Raj. You don't care about my honour? How dare you utter things that are impossible? Why is it impossible Kajal, why? Because I'm the daughter-in-law of the Singhaniya family. I shall not bring them to disrepute. So far, I felt they lost their son because of me. Do you want me to ruin their daughter's life too? - Kajal, I'm talking about my life. - Raj, you are being selfish. But get this clear. If you refuse to marry Jiya you'll see me dead. Remember. Kajal. - Jiya... - Jiya... Hi. - When did you come? - Why? Shouldn't I come? I didn't mean that. Kajal and I were just talking about you... Only four days to go for our engagement. So I thought I'd come and take sister-in-law along with me. When I phoned Nainital, they told me you were here, too. And when I reached here, I was told a big drama was being staged. I didn't do anything wrong by coming here, did I? No, you did the right thing, my sister. - You've come at the right moment. - Sister-in-law, your hands are so cold. Are you all right? If you say so, I'll even postpone my engagement. No. The engagement will go on as planned. And it'll be grand. Let's go, Jiya. [TEMPLE BELL] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Kajal's state rents my heart. But none of us can help it. There's no solution for sadness. There is, uncle. If you don't mind, may I suggest something? Yes, go on. Why don't you get her married again? What are you saying, dear? Our society is yet to recognize a widow's remarriage. Besides, it's hard to find a match for a widow. Leave that to me. I'll find a boy from a very good family. - Tell me, do you have any objections? - But... Dear, if it's happiness you're going to bring our daughter - why would we object? - All right. Leave the rest to me. In fact, I already have a suitable boy for her in mind. - Hello.- Hello. Hi Jiya. How come you remembered me, suddenly? Monty, you told me once your wedding suit has been stitched, remember? - Yes, of course. - It's time to get it dry-cleaned. - You're going to be wearing it soon. - Really? Is that true? Don't get too excited. Just do as I told you. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - Sister-in-law. - Jiya? How does this wedding dress look? - Very beautiful, just like our Jiya. - You talk so sweetly. Sweet words come to me at the very sight of you. Same here. Anyway, wear this sari and get ready quickly. What are you saying? Are you out of your mind? I'm a widow, Jiya. How can I wear a bridal dress? Which century do you live in? That practice is dated now. Whatever. Our society will never allow this. Are you concerned about my happiness or society's? I'd do anything for your happiness, Jiya. All right then, you will definitely wear this sari. And what's more, it's from your hands that I shall accept my engagement ring. - No! Don't force me. - Not a word shall I hear. Wear this sari and get ready quickly. Or I shall simply refuse to marry. You know me well, Sister-in-law. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Ramsingh. Take it away. - What evil times we live in! - Isn't she ashamed? - Good Lord! It's apocalypse! - It's true, aunt. Look how she is decked up. No one cares for good and evil these days! - That's Karan's widow, isn't she? - What's her name? Kajal. And yes, she is the one. What was it you were saying? Tell me frankly. My child, it's not right for her to adorn herself like this. It hasn't been that long since her husband died. You're right. But didn't your son die last year? Kavita, you lost your sister. And Mrs. Khanna, you lost your father. - But you've all dressed up to the do. - The rules for a widow are different. That's our culture. Rules? Dual standards! If you lose a father, son, or brother you don't grieve. But if you lose a husband you should wear white. Why? I ask, why are these rules only for women, and not for men? Why don't widowers wear white dresses? Great are the traditions of my country. If that's how things are Kajal will soon cease to be a widow. We'll get her married again. Ramsingh, Monty, come with me. Put the engagements rings on each other. What are you doing, Jiya? You and Raj are going to be engaged. Sure, but first the elder daughter should be engaged, right Papa? Of course. Kajal, we consider you our daughter, not a daughter-in-law. And we took a decision in the best of your interests. Yes my child, you have a whole life ahead of you. And we're thankful to Mr. Singhaniya for his noble thought. What are you saying? Did anyone ask me if I'm willing to marry? - Sister-in-law, does Monty lack something? - Jiya! - Or are you in love with someone else? - What nonsense! It's the truth! You're in love with my fiancé, Raj. - Enough Jiya, please! - It's true, Kajal. May I ask you what right you had to threaten Raj with suicide if he didn't marry me? Tell me, why did Raj agree to marry me? I know everything, I've heard everything. It isn't acceptable to me that he weds me and continues to love you. Stop it, Jaya! There's nothing of the sort. Look, if you wish, I'm ready for this marriage. Monty, come on, put the ring on my finger. Stop! Enough is enough. Come to your senses, Kajal. You can't ruin your life - for somebody else's happiness. - Why? Why? Does marrying again ruin one's life? Why are you stopping her from marrying? What does she mean to you? What relationship do you share with her? Do you want a wife and a mistress together? -Jiya! Do you wish to know what she means to me? Do you? Raj? That's what she means to me. She is my wife. Any objections? Anybody has problems? Want to say something, aunt? - Tell me! - Raj, it's just what I wanted. I staged this mock engagement with Monty so that you would openly declare your love for her. Not a burden, I want to become your wings so that you can fly high, very high. Jiya... You have grown up, really. I was mistaken about you, really. - I am sorry. - I ought to apologize to you, Raj. Though involuntarily, I have hurt Kajal alot. Forgive me, Kajal.
