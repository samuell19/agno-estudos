The Lantto boys have also been fishing last night Oh Yep Are we going again tonight, old-timer? Who knows if we'll catch anything Oh, Jussi! Where should I take his wife? Life should separate us... If one takes a drop of the funny stuff... To take such a wimp for a wife, a handsome man! Uh huh... A bad wife... Fucking shit! Damn bitches, go to hell! Juhani-daddy... Our cow is calving She's got it backwards I... came to you Do I get help? It's urgent Goddammit Fuck, to kill... Why bring him here? He's not mine Well, he's been here as a hired hand, hasn't he? Has he been hit many times? I don't know, it was such a fast job - and I didn't see him much Did you hit him? -No Who then? Iitori of the house of Lantto I'll get the police tomorrow, it won't do any good now - they would just blame me There were witnesses, right? Fuck, it must be chopped to pieces You got it in Helsinki, just like me. Bad blood, godddammit. - The bad get the syphilis in Helsinki. He smoked in Helsinki. - There's syphilis frther away, too. I got gonorrhea Tell me, Jussi-daddy, how I can repay your help...? No need to pay for a case like this Not him. - Right I'd do it any which way. - Right Sure I would have. -Well, Jussi-daddy is a married man Well, maybe I could give it a try, then Oh... He's such a male - for now Good morning. - Where are you coming from this early? There was a cow about to die in Liinunkorpi We were able to save it with Juhani-daddy Why don't we have a coffee? We already drank in Liinunkorpi, but... well... I wonder if they fought at the ball... I don't know, they came at night and he seems to be OK. - Yes He's probably courting your Martta - and they're staying in the barns all through the nights, like I did Yep, yep She's a handsome girl, that Martta - and pretty too, with nothing else to complain about I think Pertti will get a good wife out of her A good wife What is it that makes you so sleepy? Who were you with last night? I do all the work here, with a grown-up in the house And where have you been all night, men? We saved a cow, it would've died. - What? Liar Been getting boned by Kurki-Vertti? He was a good fisherman, - He caught more with a rod than we'd catch with a net They weren't fishing for clams They say a tramp got killed, is that true? It's true A tramp, that's what he was Such a trouble-maker No wonder they killed him I sure don't miss him Didn't he come from south? Yep, from there. They said from Lapua or something That's where the heroes are It's a pity a young man had to - go to jail. - A man in his prime I wonder if he had any relatives? Surely a father and a mother like the rest of us I hear he left a mother and a father behind, - don't know about sisters or brothers. - I see O Lord, if I, - a traveller upon earth - at the end of my journey will see you O, if once - I might see the Lord - in his glory My heart yearns for you, - screams for you - my spirit Alone is... A good farmhand In winter he brought water from the hole in the ice and chopped small wood Careful, now It'll be ok You're welcome to take coffee. There's soup, too Hi. - Howdy Now aren't you a plump girl... Old man! What have you done to your leg? saw a Lapp and started limping Limping, because she's seen half a man Making tricks, goddammit I'll show you, I'll come and put fire on your cunthairs I like the Lapp, - the one that was at the fueral the day before yesterday You are too young We're almost of the same age I hear he's got a whole lot of bastards, take care Oula Nahkamaa is his name Come visit us sometime, you never come Age has nothing to do with it, if you get a crush on someone It ain't strange, - if you can't stop thinking about men in your age Can't see nor hear anything Who is it? A Lapp. From another siida. His name is Nahkamaa. He's got some reindeer here for counting Is the Lapp married? No, he isn't married, - but he has a bad reputation, anyway has a whole lot of kids Get up, you, your father is going to the timber harvest You need to prepare his food I'll squeeze the milk from your tits, - if you don't stop sleeping naked it's the same game every morning She messes around with the old-timer just to spite him I tell you, that's trouble - when I was a child I was ashamed even in front of my own father, - but you'll end up just like Aino Liinukorpi, - selling your ass God bless you We've got no one to send to the timber harvest Hannes is still too young Things aren't so well with us, either - Juhani-daddy drinks up everything he earns A man is a woman's help and joy. For you too. You'll always get something out of his earnings, - Surely he can spare a few marks at home, too You haven't taken care of that in your time You've been giving it away for too cheap I've never asked for your man's cock, you know that He goes to work through all the barns I wouldn't wonder if he ends up a father of a bastard Be careful lest you soon have grandchildren Juhani-daddy wouldn't fuck you anyway Now look at that, a drunkard pretending to fix a sledge He can't get a log on the sledge, that's the reason Own wife calls him a drunkard Run, run, fucking bitch So you're not coming on Sunday. Not worth waiting? -No Might even take a month Surely you'll make sure that there's enough smallwood, old-timer? Sure, sure I'll take care of the wood But don't drive the stallion sweaty so early on Goddammit Pull! And again Do you know about the reindeer separation? Is it soon? Shouldn't it be soon? I think they'll be driven in soon I just saw a man going to your place It was a Lapp from Nahkamaa I've even dreamt about him Oh God, I don't know what to do He's so manly Read the Bible, - it'll help Elina, what's Aulis like? He's quiet That's fine, you're quiet too but is he an eager kisser? What do you mean? Is he horny? But we aren't married Jesus Christ, what are you thinking about us? Don't be such a hypocrite Why would you get married just for a kiss? Tell me now, have you...? No we don't do that What a nice weather We'll see what kind of a winter we'll get We'll see She's pregnant, that Hertta Right Sired at our place Our Albert has stuffed good stuff into her arse Come with me Martta That's all there is to it, just come Come with me. - In a while That's a good bull, our Albert I'm not going anywhere with you They give sermons about us, have you heard? There's been nothing between us, I don't care for you Let's go skiing. I won't get any worse Have you been before... Last year I was there carrying hay I've been there picking cloudberry It's a tough job, carrying sacks of potatoes. -Yep I'm there reaping crops every now and then Water keeps going in the legs of my boots, - it's so hard to find a dry spot Wade between the tussocks I won't let you I still won't let you I won't let you fuck me, and you know it Oh shit And again in a while Why didn't you keep at it? Who could do it? The grease shoots out, it's impossible Keep your pants on, we'll screw again soon Wait for a while Fuck by yourself It ain't all that warm, this house Come sleep next to me, it'd be warmer Come here beside me, under the blanket What would happen if I came, eh?

Keep quiet, kids, it won't help Oh my God, look at all that blood It's gotta be blocked. Bring some water, Hannes Gotta clean it up Pray in God's name, children. Can you do it? When would poor Aino have had the time to teach you? All right, boys That one belongs to Aulis Rantasalo, bring it here Here's some blood for Aino Liinukorpi I heard she died this morning Aino is dead? Yep. They say she had a difficult miscarriage She dealt her ass out on the field I used to visit her too, and what a perky ass that was Why did you come here? - I don't know Girls like that... Come down Will you buy me a coffee, I'll come? Sure thing Hey, Elekko, come buy coffee Would you give anything else? - Good buns I'll knock at your window tonight, will you let me in? I'll fart through the doorcrack It's too cruel, I can't look It's never bothered me, I don't find it strange That'd be 20 thousand Take eighteen Hell, let's split it in half All right One, two, three, four... Come to Yll√§s to be my wife. I have a house there It actually belongs to my father, but he'll die soon enough I'll buy you a ring when I go to Norway next summer I've got a big house I know you You have children in every village Iknow what you want What they're saying isn't true. they're all lying Give me a kiss too You're a perv I'll marry you. - We'll see I'll bring you an engagement ring next summer Fuck, take it easy! Are you burying Aino alone? That's right I've been thinking about taking Hannes from Liinunkorpi - for an adoptive son, to help the old-timer I visited Kurkelainen, the children are there He's such a healthy kid - and age is starting to slow me down, as well. - Yeah Oh Jesus, to look at yourself in the mirror in the middle of the day, - like you had nothing else to do This village is a den of sin You cry and whine - in your sins like miserable pups under the table of the lamb - begging for crumbs from his heavenly meal, - his heavenly table of mercy But remember that you have earned nothing - that he should give you, but every crumb of bread, - with which he feeds you is great mercy I had a dream I saw - it looked like Aulis Outakova He wanted me to go with him What did he tell you? He said nothing He grabbed my neck and whispered in my ear, - but I didn't understand what he said Were you horny for that young man in your dream? Yes Did you feel like you couldn't stay still, - and did you get sweaty? Yes Listen to me, Elina, - lustful thoughts were with you Was this Aulis even a Christian? - That just makes it worse, - Because a godforsaken man, just by being there - leads his fellows to doom - and the tortures of hell I woke up from that dream And I felt good Oh my God what a shitpile this head is Push your head lower so I can soak it And there's living lice here, too Here's a new pair of trousers for you Holes, too, with four buttons There's a bit too much in the legs, but you're still growing Your mother wouldn't know you if she saw you now They're at it already Think about it, my brother He smiled at you from the cross and forgave you - all your sins he asked you for mercy, you - who are not worthy enough - to tie his shoelaces, - you who are worth nothing but were you merciful unto him? no, you lecherous puppy, - with a spear you pierced his holy chest - and drank the blood from his veins and enjoyed it, - just like you now, - hidden from people's view - enjoy liquor and moonshine Hear me, you miserable men, you puppies of Jesus, - let the sin spill from your mouths - and beg forgiveness for your sins, - because in the dirt of sin - you have lived all your lives, - and you have guzzled the fruits of crime and murder But have you seen to the state of your souls? hasn't your heart warned you of it? I say, yes it has warned you numerous times you have shut your ears with earplugs of lecherousness - and only listened to the sounds of lewdness I tell you, you sinful people, - you have drunk the blood of Christ and eaten his flesh, - and now his blood screams for revenge - for this horrible deed Amen, amen The sins of your fathers from the third and the fourth generation - are upon you, your blood is boiling - black in the cavities of sin Jesus... Mercy But God's only son will save you he will prepare joy and bliss for you in Heaven But before that you are to beg and kneel down, - thank him so that he would take away your sins - and cleanse you with the blood of the lamb Rejoice, Christians, your saviour will come Rejoice, Christians, Jesus will forgive your sins Satan wanders around like a screaming lion - waiting for a chance to swallow you - and how many has he already swallowed He has opened his mouth, - whence fire and sulphur and saltpetre have burned - and swallowed you Jesus Christ rescues you from the mouth of Satan He shall clothe you - in a clean white shirt, - and like a bride you'll walk in the joy and bliss of heaven you'll surrender to become the wife of Jesus - under the fruit trees, - in the joy and bliss of Heaven Sinners, - listen to the man of God whose come to your village - to rescue your sinful souls - to the joy of Heaven The sun has come to your lives Your souls will be gathered in golden bowls before Jesus He shall inspect you and be merciful to your souls I love Jesus Christ I want to live in the house of Lord I fly like a bird in the sky I have a room in the house of Lord There he shall cleanse my sinful mouth There God shall clothe a chilly body Bride, bride, bride Come, I'll pray with you Fuck, I have a new pair of trousers Let me go, fucker He can't see it when he is running This might be a good place Come help me Were Selmas kisses better? I saw it... at the meeting Was hers good? I meant nothing I hope you're not angry, Hannes. - No, I'm not You know how it is. - Yeah You just want it It's strange but that's how it is Then you end up having a kid Not if you're pregnant already We got a big rabbit What is it? - It's me No... The old man might wake up Somewhere else Round your neck Not like that Are you crazy? You're burning his back Hannes, throw water on the rocks Not much, or I'll have to leave She's a good gal to have in the sauna, our Martta I wish you'd turn out like that I'm like you in that - I could spend my whole life in the sauna It feels so good to really heat it up - and then wash up with smelly soap Make some coffee when you go in Are you mad? Coffee in the middle of the night! Fuck, you'll cook spirit in a bible if I say so - when I come home once in a month That's how it is, and shut the door - or the heat will escape We'll drink a shot with the old-timer and Hannes as soon as we get in As the road took us to battle - where we only heard the bullets singing Martta, come out What is it? - Come Is it something important? Not the usual? - No Now he's found peace He has left earthly troubles behind Take him by the legs, I'll grab his shoulders He was so energetic this morning, now he's gone I wish I could leave as beautifully It's no use wishing for death (hevosen kello kilisee ) Where's dad? Dear God, coming home drunk, - even though he knows death has visited us He's in the sauna. - Shut up for a change I have a sip so seldom His spirit is in the Lord's hands. He looked so peaceful It's too late to understand, - that he'll be stuffed into a coffin at home Wouldn't that be something, if we could sing hymns it wouldn't be so boring O Lord, if I, - a traveller upon earth - at the end of my journey - could see you O, if I once - saw the Lord - in his glory Don't put stones on the coffin, there's plenty of dirt That's not proper Everyone has a weak moment It's no too much if you cry sometimes First you taught me to make love - then you taught me to love Then you taught me to forget, as well... Goddammit, I don't wanna sit on my ass all day long It's ok to have a taste now and then ... just like you forgot me When I'm lying here on the ground - and still sighing in my feelings Even if it all ends on the battlefield - I'll think of your image in the end I felt so weak - I couldn't come to the church It got so cold Of course it's important to die in the summer It's just that the body stays in better condition in the winter It's difficult in the summer I think everybody only has good memories of old-timer Just good Hannes Do you hear me? You're not sleeping anyway What? Come to my bed It's warmer Now you can fuck me Is it better than Selma's? Yes Should I shoot it? I'm about to come Not yet I'm pregnant, it doesn't matter if it goes in What is it? It's important I've been thinking it through from every viewpoint It'd be the best - for both of us, if we got married you being the way you are It's not just that. I've always liked you What? I'm going to have a baby Whose is it? Oulas My own daughter, goddamn fucking - I'll rob his tail Get Martta. Let her bathe, goddammit I don't give a shit I don't care I'd never have believed - seeing my own daughter with a stuffed-up stomach Shall I get her? Do it Go to sauna Don't worry, Martta, - you were born two weeks after the wedding, as well I won't go Go, or he'll raise a ruckus if you refuse to go against his order Did he tell me to? Fucking Christ, are you ashamed? Yes I am Do you know what you should get? Don't hit! Come Hannes I've nothing against you, Martta, but that whoring son of a bitch I'll kill him You'd better tell him to avoid me Hell, I'll take his life Let it be, just sleep Accidents happen Remember yourself. I was an innocent maid, - but you didn't let me be till you got laid Fuck, you kept offering me your pussy I wouldn't mind so much, but he's a certain man who's had a bunch of kids with different women (talking in Sami ) What'd he say? He told us not to sin What is it? Elope with me. Don't say anything at home Let's do it right now I don't know. - Eh? My mom would be alone She wouldn't make it She'd die if I left She'll die anyway, she won't leave before her time I don't dare I don't want to Stay here, I'll visit you I'm giving birth in september It'd be good for you here, you wouldn't have to work Father wants to kill you (talking in Sami ) Oula I said it for no reason it sounds so good You have a big tummy You do Can you believe it I can feel it when the child kicks harder I believe No you don't. - I do, I do Come home Remember, he died by drowning Let her sleep Dear Lord, he's left! He better watch out for his skin if he comes here (talking in Sami ) Come have a coffee, Martta Damn it, Aune, it's so late Wake up, Aune! You should give a massage too sometime - seeing as the therapists don't come anymore Oh shit! - You never know, it could be the time to go She's been talking about death ever since she visited the priest and Martta's giving birth too, so she can't work The cow will be left unmilked Goddammit, keep your distance when you see Must you always beat? Whose child is it? - What do you care? Sure I care - Not yours that's sure Is it the Lapp's? Was it him? Hold the scythe like this That's it Much better. - I can do it I don't want to I think I was already fooling around with women at your age Yeah I'm not trying to insult you, - It's just that my own tools make me want to get laid It's crazy I understand it well, - seeing how my mother was so into it. That was the trouble with her I don't want to That's good, Hannes, not taking liquor Not drinking doesn't spoil a man How'd you get up? Because Martta is in her last months If I were your mother, you wouldn't swim in that condition You're not my mother Have you heard, we have a meeting next week? You too should come to hear the Word of God I'll come, it could be refreshing I too have felt so bad since Oula disappeared Just sew the linen It's coming out early - because she refused to abstain from work in her last days You'd better believe it won't live - being born almost a month before its time Martta, have you counted right? Plump boy, almost four kilos Shouldn't it have been born in early September? Who knows her acquaintances? Can they even count? Don't bother Just be a pal Here, have a drink You gotta drink when I treat you. Drink, boy
