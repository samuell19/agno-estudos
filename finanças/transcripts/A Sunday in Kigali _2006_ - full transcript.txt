April 6, 1994. The plane of the Rwandan President, Habyarimana Juvenal, is shot down by two missiles. The Presidential Security Forces and Militia take action. It is the beginning of the Genocide. Three months later, the Rwandan Patriotic Front's (RPF) victory ends the massacre. The majority of the 800,000 victims were of Tutsi ethnic origin. A SUNDAY IN KIGALI JULY 15, 1994 Mr. Valcourt? You?re not dead? I haven?t seen her, Mr. Bernard. No one has. SIX MONTHS EARLIER Sorry. Thanks. You?re sweet. You know my name? Sweet? Oh, your name's Gentille? It suits you. Thanks. Dreaming, Mr. Valcourt? Even after three months I still find it breathtaking. Swooning over hills? Men don?t swoon for hillsides, Boss. Believe me! Modeste, I asked you not to call me Boss. OK, Boss. The party is the CDR! The Tutsis are the real enemy. And everyone knows it, you bastard! What are you filming? You don?t have permission. And this? You?re here to film? the Rwandan army's fight against AIDS. This has nothing to do with that. I?m filming troops. Want your press pass and papers to be confiscated? What happened, Modeste? - Did I say to stop shooting? - No, Boss. And you, Augustin! What are you afraid of? I?m paying you, not them. We live here, Boss. They run the country. Stop calling me Boss! You talk to us like a boss. Pretty new girl. Come see me later. You won?t be sorry. Proud, too. Even better. Look at the ass on her! She looks like she's hot! I can?t wait! Come see me after your beer. You won?t be sorry. - Canadian fag! - Qu?b?cois! What, you prefer black asses? Defending the Negroes! He just wants to pork her! Forget it. Who cares? Bernard? You don?t visit us anymore? You are magnificent! So why not enjoy it? Forget it. He's in love. What's the AIDS infection rate here? Around 10%... in the entire country. In Kigali it's 35%. But nothing's done. Officials say we exaggerate. How do men react? when you tell them they?re infected? They?re convinced sleeping with a virgin will cure them. They laugh when I show them a condom. And if you insist? They make a pass. When did you meet Rock? After I called him a serial killer. He was the most popular DJ in Kigali. All the girls were after him. I was trying to explain to him that with AIDS, he was a real public danger. It's you who's right, Em?rita. Abstinence is the best condom. According to the Pope. It's not because of religion that I don?t have sex. It's my mother. What does Agathe have to do with it? Mom runs a bordello, she screws enough for the two of us. Gentille, a round on me! - You exaggerate. - Exaggerate? The protest almost went out of control. It was planned. The extremists had hidden grenades. If the UN had stepped in... - Kabang! - You don?t believe that? It's crazy, why would they? So Belgium would leave. Like the US in... - Somalia. - Right. There'd be no one to stop them. I came at the right time. You always do. Know what the killers talk about? About you, Raphael. Your promotion at the People's Bank. That's good. They say you?re VP because of your Tutsi sisters who sleep with the Bank's white director. Everyone knows. Thanks. C?lestin! Em?rita, you drive me wild. I said no, C?lestin. Same old story. C?lestin, a soda please. What are you filming? - What? - What are you filming? I?m filming beauty itself. Where is Gentille, Maurice? We'd know if she'd died. People don?t disappear. Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans did. My wife and children died. I haven?t heard from my parents. I?m sorry, I didn?t know. I searched everywhere, even in the mass graves. Nothing. They went crazy, Mr. Bernard. Neighbors killed neighbors. Friends killed friends. Husbands killed their wives and kids. I was held up at the border for three months, wondering where she was. I can?t stand it. Help me! I have to know, do you understand? I don?t know anything. You speak our language now? I had nothing else to do. Slow down, you'll hit someone. It'll be curfew soon. Look at them. They?re kids, but they act like killers. Your papers! I'd offer you champagne, but there's none anywhere. You?re a man, Valcourt. Not many Whites are brave enough to return to the darkest places of their lives. And the happiest ones. Did you hide more fugitives after I left? Yes, up till the day the border guard told me to step out of the car. I ran him over, may've killed him. But it was him or me. I hid out in Mille Collines until the massacres ended. Are you hungry? Victor, help me find Gentille. How can I? No one's heard anything. Almost everyone who knew her died or disappeared. Maybe it's best not to know. You tell me that? You risked your life for strangers! And I should do nothing? I?m scared for you, Valcourt, that's all. Sir. What's this? I ordered the best, not local brew! Dirty Tutsi! Did you fuck a White for the job? Sorry, we?re out. - What? - We?re out. I could have you fired. Beat it. Gentille! I?ll take your local brew. - Are you sure? - Yes, I?m sure. Sir, please, I?m Hutu, not Tutsi. I can show you my papers. Tell them. Or they'll fire me. I'd like to talk to you, but not here. Shall we meet later? You write books? No, I?m a journalist. And filmmaker. You make movies! What kind? Well... Forgive me, I shouldn?t. No, that's alright. I?m making a documentary about AIDS, a disease that doesn?t exist, according to your government. Dirty whore! Sleeping with Whites! Think you?re too good for us? You dirty Tutsi! - Did you see that ass? - Let's do her here. She wants to get away, before we cut off her head. We'll get her once the White's gone back home. I don?t know how you stand it. Do you take a taxi home at night? I don?t live very far. Are you really Hutu? My mom's Tutsi, my dad's Hutu. If the father's Hutu, the kids are too. Thanks. Do you believe me, sir? Call me Bernard. Do you, Mr. Bernard? Gentille, if I say you?re Hutu, no one will believe me. - I am Hutu. - I know, but... When the extremists describe Tutsi women, it's you: Your thin nose, long legs, slim waist. Your eyes never leave me. And you?re the only White who hasn?t asked to... you know what. I?m no different. You want to sleep with me? I could be your dad! I?m 24. Here that's already old. If it's for a visa, I?ll help you. But I?m not a White who trades help for love. You?re hurtful, sir. It's not to hurt you. But love has no place in my life. That's no life. I should go. Finish your beer. Don?t you like me? Thanks for the walk. You accompanied me. How's it going, Raphael? I think I?ll turn in. I didn?t want to die alone, abandoned in a nightmare. I always wanted to die in a nice bed. - We?re in no hurry. - No. I am. I?d rather die of AIDS than be butchered by a machete. I?d like a real woman, one last time. A woman with huge breasts. And a real behind. Leave it to us. Beauty itself, like you said. Yes, I dream about her. Why do you avoid her? She wants a passport. Don?t act like that. You'd do anything to leave this shithole too. I know. I don?t blame her. - Hi, Raphael. - The Condom Fairy! This will ease the pain. When you've had it, just let me know. You can leave free as a bi rd, without a care. Goodbye. She's saying goodbye to him. They?re tiny, like they just got out of the pool. The French think they?re studs in bed and treat us like dirt. I?m doing you a favor, you fucking slut whore, goddamn black cunt! Must we always talk about that? And Canadians? Canadians! They hold your hand, sweet-talk you. Come time to pay, they get all embarrassed. They?re scared God will punish them. Mom, please! Please! Scared Em?rita will scold them! Don?t judge the hand that feeds you, my girl. We had such good times together. Bernard, Rock wants you. What's so funny? Don?t waste your time filming AIDS. You should be filming the hatred. Is your crew here? No. But I have my camera. AIDS hurried me into the arms of death. That was an accident. But there's worse than that disease in this country: Hatred. The hatred men sow all around, like I sowed death with my sperm. I?m Tutsi. That is also an accident. But above all, I am Rwandan. I am your mirror. I?m just dying a bit before you do, that's all. You take care of Rock. What? Alright, but I?m wearing gloves. Come on, Mathilde! - I don?t want AIDS! - You have it! I don?t want to get it twice! Love is here. Farewell, farewell Farewell, farewell Farewell, son of our mother Farewell, son of our same flesh You are leaving, though we didn't hate you You are leaving, though we liked you so much God, giver of life This worthy man who you are calling Was respected by al I who knew him Welcome him into the kingdom of heaven Stop. Let me drink of you. And return to where I came from. Farewell, farewell If God wishes it, we will meet again Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Why not? We've filmed Rock for months! The radio said he's an Inkotanyi. He's your friend, not a cockroach. We didn?t know that. We won?t make the film. You signed a contract. What?ll you do, Boss? Call the cops? Cowards like you will destroy Rwanda! Humanitarians like you get rich off our misery, Boss. Where is everybody? Raphael won?t come. They burned his house. We?re all in danger. No one will come to the funeral. Hey! What are you doing with a White? See you around, little whore! I came because he's your friend. Rock, you died because you sought to enjoy life. The life that God gave you, and which you lived to the fullest. The life that God alone can take back, despite the machete-wielding goons and the hatred they breed. May God embrace your soul. Amen. Miss Gentille, you?re fired for absence without notice. You?re a liar, like those whose boots you lick. Coward! It's because she was seen at the funeral. Manu! Manu, come on! Let's have a drink at your place. Rock's right, we?re sitting on a volcano. Then why don?t you leave? I?m a leading opposition deputy, I can?t run away. What about you, Francine? I?d never leave my husband when he's in danger. Neither would I. Oh, I?m coming. Excuse me. Francine's like you. She thinks her passport will protect her. Don?t you worry for Madeleine? I?m counting on the UN, Dallaire's a friend. He may be a general, but he's a soldier. If ordered to sit tight, he will. True, but Francine is adamant. She should leave and hide Madeleine, but she refuses to listen to me. Sorry, be right back. Good evening. Has Rock's death got you down? How did Emmanuel and Francine meet? They met in Montreal. Manu was studying there. They met at a party for St-Jean, Quebec's national holiday, the beginning of summer. Everybody's in parks, on the mountain. Francine said Manu danced divinely. How do you dance? - Me? I don?t. - I?ll show you. - No way! - Yes, come on. - No, please! - Please, come on. I can?t, I?ll get hurt. You bastard! We?ll burn your dump and get rid of you. Fuck you! Want to kill me? Why don?t you, then? You?re not a real Black, you sleep with a White! So what? You?re just jealous. I?ll skin you alive, make you into a rug. You, muzungu, leave our women alone! Dirty slut! Whitey's whores! Leaving already? You?re scared, huh? Manu, I?ll come back and make you eat your balls! Sleep in the other bed. Just give me time, OK? I don?t have AIDS, if you?re worried. No one here has AIDS. The government says so. Sorry, I?m stupid. Forgive me, I?m so stupid. You don?t love me. I love you too much. You?re so beautiful, so young, so beautiful. - Compared to you, I?m... - So dumb. Yes. You complicate everything. You film, you think. When others laugh, you smile. When you laugh, it's silently. You see, I?m a bore. Life is short, Bernard. Especially here. Show me what love is like, like in the movies. The kisses that never end, the bouquets of flowers, the sex, but above all, the romance. Above all, the romance. Loving Whitey. That's what I am for you, a passport to the west. The dream of many Africans. Young, beautiful and black. Is that what I am for you? The dream of many Whites. What's the problem? It's open. Come in! You?re my first customer. I saw C?lestin looting a house. He saw me and ran. It may not have been him. Maybe it was someone who looks like him. I?m no idiot, I?m sure it was him. Do people know what we?ll be at death's doorstep? What do you mean? C?lestin had an advantage over Raphael. He's Hutu. He was given a choice. Either be killed, or kill the Tutsis, his neighbors, friends, sister-in-law. He chose. He didn?t want to end like Raphael. What happened to Raphael? Tell me! So I understand! So I know! For Raphael, it was... It was horrible. They shut all the local Tutsis in the church. Raphael was tortured on the front step. They cut off his extremities first, then his genitals. And they... left him to bleed to death. They'd have done that to C?lestin if he hadn?t killed too. He couldn?t face that. You see, you thought we were animals. Now you know that we are humans. Bernard? This is for you. - Maurice! - Yes, Mr. Bernard? What happened to Agathe's girls? The Hutus raped almost all the Tutsi women. Prostitutes have no work. But what about Agathe? They trashed her place. No one's seen her. Give me a lead or I?ll think you?re hiding things. I?ve only myself to hide. Why would you hide? My loved ones are all dead. Why me? Why am I still alive? Muzungu! Muzungu! Anybody home? Hello? Is anybody home? Anybody home? Agathe? Agathe? No, don?t move! Wait, I?ll come back! Wait. Here, drink. Drink this. You?re safe now, Agathe. They've gone. The extremists have gone. The FPR controls the city. It?s safe now. There's peace. What are you doing here? Didn?t you leave? I?m looking for Gentille. Gentille? Do you know where she is? Easy... Easy. Bernard! Father Louis... I just heard. I came immediately. It?s horrible. That's why they killed him. How so? Forgive him, he's new here. Bernard Lamarre, Canadian Consulate. You chose a bad moment to come. The police say thieves killed him. A bullet right in the forehead? No way. It?s a sign, a warning. Maybe the police killed him. Excuse me, I don?t feel well. I?ll get some fresh air. It seems nothing can stop them. Are you scared? My life belongs to God. But you... you?re in danger. I missed you. Me too. It?s become too dangerous. You have to leave. You?re in danger too. Not as much as you. I have to finish my film. I won?t go alone to Canada. They won?t let you in without me. But I have friends in Burundi where you'd be safe. What would I do in Burundi? You'd live! You'd survive until this blows over. I won?t leave without you. You want to be killed? Raped? Is that it? You want to get rid of me. Can?t you see I?m scared for you? I couldn?t bear seeing you hurt. You are my well, I am your spring. I am your footstep, you are my path. What's that? A little game I played as a boy. Want to try? Alright. You are my foot, I am your shoe. You are my man, I am your love. You are my tongue, I am your mouth. You?ll provoke If thieves didn?t murder Father Cardinal, Tutsi rebels did. No, it's impossible. He hid Tutsis who had nowhere to go. The inquiry is not being run by us now, but by the French secret service. Since when do the French investigate the death of a Canadian? We don?t have the money or staff to carry it out. They support the dictatorship. Think they?ll tell you the truth? Mr. Valcourt, the situation is more explosive now than ever. Rwanda has its pride, you know. What about our pride? Cardinal was a Canadian citizen. We?re in a foreign country, and this is none of your business. Am I being clear? Yes. But find someone else to identify the dead. Cause there?ll be more. Qu?b?cois? I?m Canadian. A Canadian passport's nice. Canadian cash is nice too. Your government loves it. How can I help you? I saw Father Cardinal's body, he was shot in the forehead. It was a political assassination. Open an inquiry. You?re drunk, Mr. Valcourt. Or, like many of your countrymen, you've been smoking pot. Not enough to blur my judgment. I have the police chief's report. He states he was attacked by a band of Tutsi rebels. They took refuge in Father Cardinal's infirmary. Father Cardinal was with them during the attack. By the way, Mr. Valcourt, is your press pass still valid? Do they have proof they were Tutsis? Why can?t you publish it? No, stop it! To hell with your prejudices! This isn?t some petty tribal war. Look, this was planned by the highest levels of government. News coverage in Canada has sunk really low. Right, bye. No one wants to know about it. Why do you stay? Because words aren?t enough. It?ll take images to stop this insanity. Think you can succeed? Honestly? No. But I have to try. Yes, hello? Yeah, it's me. Why Zaire? We agreed on Burundi, not Zaire. OK, alright. Gisenyi. Did they receive the advance? No way, the deal was... $1,000 up front, $4,000 when they cross the border. Not a cent. Where will they cross? Wait one second, please. Yeah. OK, we?ll be there at midnight. Of course I have the money. OK, bye. What's wrong? What did I say? Stop trying to save me. You can?t stay, don?t you see? You?ll die. Understand? I can?t let you stay here. Don?t tell me what to do. Anything's better. Exile, or even death, but with you. You are my flame. You are my wick. You are my dream. I love you. How does it work? You just press here. Want me to look silly? No, in love. In love? In love is easy. So, so easy. Cyprien has AIDS. He got it from the market ladies where he sells his tobacco. One night, drunk, he had an accident with his wife. An accident? Georgina, his wife, now infected too, gave birth to a seropositive baby. Cyprien, you have AIDS. So does your wife. What about your kids? How can I know? It's God's will, what can I do? Death doesn?t matter to you. Dying's normal. Don?t people die in Canada? Maya, Maya the bee. Winnie, Winnie the Pooh bear. Be careful of the bee. Don't move. They surrounded the area and made up a list. 347 names, all Tutsis, aside from a few Hutu opponents. When the signal's given, they?ll butcher us. Are you on it? Of course. Even you?re not safe. At the market, the militia said they'd cut you into pieces. You?re pals with Rock and Manu. Don?t ask what they said about Gentille. Valcourt, do you love Gentille? Of course I love her. Why are you waiting to leave? My film. I have to make it, for Rock, Manu, everyone. Forget us. A camera's no good against machetes. Let's eat. It?s nearly curfew. That's my cousin. Wait here. Wait! - No! - Yes! Get off me! Canadian! Canadian passport! Let them through. They?re friends of mine. She's Hutu, he's Canadian. The Canadian likes Tutsi whores? She's not for you, Boss. This is a Hutu country, Boss. If you don?t want to die with the Tutsis, find yourself a Hutu woman. Please, let us go. Alright for tonight. But you must contribute to the militia. Give him what he wants. Valcourt, get in. Cyprien! Come on, your wife's waiting for you. I forced her to and she didn?t even react. How do you do it? Show us. Georgina! Why, shit! Why? Georgina! Bernard! I suppose that what you have to tell me couldn?t wait. They?ll kill Emmanuel, and you sit behind your desk. Emmanuel and Francine are friends, but I can?t help. It?s like I was being kept from saving my own children. My friends were just murdered: Cyprien and Georgina Munyankore. Along with their children. Probably the same age as yours. I am sincerely distressed. I share your indignation. You?re here to enforce the Arusha Accords. It says the UN will disarm the militia, confiscate guns, establish order. It said. The Western powers cut all those provisions. They refused to foot the bill. Is that fair? No, but it's not my decision. My role is to manage the consequences. In practice, I have neither the men nor equipment to intervene. What about the 1,000 French and Belgian troops? The Italians? The 250 Marines in Bujumbura? If you manage to convince the French, Belgians, Italians and Americans to place them under my command, I?ll be eternally grateful. What will it take? Thousands of deaths? They won?t say that thousands of dead Africans leave them completely indifferent, but it does. Would you repeat that on camera? Gladly, but I?m not authorized to. General, disobedience can change history. I didn?t come to Rwanda to make history. And I never learned to disobey. It?s not too late. I agreed to speak to Emmanuel's friend, not a reporter. Please excuse me. His friend will hold you responsible if he or his family is murdered. The international community will do the same, and wash their hands of it. How can you sleep with so many deaths on your conscience? It?s been ages since I?ve slept. And you? But I promise you, I?ll never abandon Rwanda. What is it? The UN forces are helpless. We have to leave. And your film? You?re more important. Their faces haunt me. Cyprien and Georgina. They haunt me. When do we go? First, we have to get married. So they let you into Canada. Get married? Yes! Gentille Sibomana, do you take Bernard Valcourt as your husband and swear fidelity to him till death do you part? I do. Me too. Really? It?s just that, I wanted to live here, teaching, writing. Not to help. Out of pure selfishness. Spend my life drinking beer and writing in a warm climate. Safe from the world. We can always stay. No, it's impossible. No one's safe now. What about her? We can?t take her with us. I?ll take her to my dad's. Forget it, with all the roadblocks. You've no papers... I can?t. You can?t what? I can?t abandon D?sir?e. And I can?t get married without my father's blessing. Going to Karago's too dangerous. Then... Then I shall marry in sadness and shame. It?s your turn to daydream, Em?rita. I won?t tell you the sins I committed tonight. Someone will be jealous. It?s with C?lestin that I sinned. Making up for lost time! You said it. I understood why it's a sin. Why is that? It makes you want to start over. Lord! We must react, denounce them. Careful what you say. Hell is next to Heaven. To your love and happiness. Your health! The glasses are too small. I forgot you?re divorced. God's forgiven you by now. I guess. But we must hurry. The day after tomorrow? Why not tomorrow? I can?t tomorrow, really. You can imagine we?re anxious to leave. I understand. Do you know Col. Th?oneste? Who wants to replace the president? For years I?ve been his confessor. Yesterday his first words were: I confess to preparing a massacre. The final massacre. He said that? I didn?t give him absolution. - Write this down. - No. I?ll do better. This may be wrong. The secret of the confessional... Too late for scruples. Go ahead. Eliminate the president. Eliminate all the leaders of the Liberals and PSD. The priorities are Emmanuel, Faustin, Prime Minister Agathe, then mobilizing the militia to exterminate all the Tutsis. Sweep the city, street by street. Spare neither women nor children. No Tutsi must survive. "No Tutsi must survive. " He said that. No, but it's a reliable source. Can you publish it tomorrow? It?s important. I?ll keep in touch. Tell me it's impossible. My angel, I love you, my angel I would have married you, my love I would have married you, my love The Canadian government has asked us to draw up an emergency evacuation plan. A mere precaution. But if Tutsi terrorism increases, we will ensure your safe passage home. Any questions? Yes? Who will be repatriated first? We?re preparing the lists. For special needs, contact the consulate. Which Tutsi terrorism do you mean? Stop filming. No press here. The RPF's border crossings and incessant attacks on government forces. Are you speaking for Canada or Rwanda? Everyone knows the rise in terrorism is due to the government. The RPF doesn?t kill at road blocks or spew hatred on the radio. All your friends are Tutsis. Everyone knows that too. That's a lie. Tomorrow I?m marrying my beloved, who's a Hutu. C?lestin, who serves your martinis with two olives and a lemon zest, is a Hutu. How can Canada, which is supposedly a democracy, support a genocidal dictatorship? Other questions about the evacuation plan? Only the evacuation plan. You haven?t answered. Canada finances the AIDS program that employs you and pays your salary. Does it pay for your golf? Next time, I slug her. They killed Em?rita. I?ll go see Agathe. We leave right after. My little girl. She loved you so much. You made her feel stronger. She denounced the crimes of the militia here. They took revenge. They took revenge! Mr. Bernard! Mr. Bernard! Mr. Bernard! Gentille left this. She went to her dad's. I tried to stop her. There's a plane to Canada tonight. You?re on the list. It may be your only chance to go. What were you thinking? A White! My age, too! I let you go into town to protect you from the village boys. Look how you act without my permission. He?ll abandon you. He always respected me. He even saved me. This man loves me for what I am, not only for pleasure. He bewitched you with his fine words. Whites never say what they think and never do what they say. You don?t even know him! I understand your disappointment. But I know all too well what a man my age is looking for in a young woman like you. Believe me, he's already in the arms of another right now. You and D?sir?e will be safe here. We?ll protect you. I was wrong to speak badly of you, sir. You could have fled our land's insanity, but you did not. If ever I flee, it will be with Gentille, or not at all. May you never forget where my daughter's from. Promise me one thing. Take her away, far, far away from here, where there are neither Hutus nor Tutsis, Whites nor Blacks, masters nor servants. Promise me! I don?t know if that paradise exists, but I promise to search. I will bless you. D?sir?e will be fine with Dad. Tell me... I can?t figure it. How can beauty... engender such hatred? Beauty's in the eyes of the beholder. To me, those hills mean hardship. I was scared to lose you. Not as much as me. We must combat the Tutsi Inkotanyis, exterminate them, sweep them from the country. They're caught, and easy to spot. Look at their hips, look at their pretty noses, and then smash them! Exterminate them! The President's plane was shot down above the airport as it was about to land. Jesus! The plane was hit by two ground-to-air missiles. It's beyond any doubt. This is the signal... It?s the end. No, the beginning. It?s alright, they?ll let us pass. They?ll let us pass. APRIL 6, 1994 BEGINNING OF THE GENOCIDE Your papers. Your papers. Canadian papers aren?t worth anything now! The foreigner's with a cockroach girl. We?ll get your whore when you?re not there to protect her. Get going. Mr. Bernard! Gentille! I?m so happy to see you! Yes, we were lucky. Father Louis left this for you. He's gone? I had to leave. I'm sorry. God bless. He left for Canada. He took the last flight. Who are you calling? Manu. It?s early. Hello? May I speak to Emmanuel, please? Manu? He doesn?t work here now. He went away. Far, far away. What is it? It?s Manu. You?re too late. I have no choice. If you go, so do I. It?s all I have. Try to get us out. It?s impossible. The roads and airport are closed. There are no flights. You?ll have to wait for the UN. Shit! It?s hard to say. Maybe 5,000, 10,000, 15,000 dead. No one knows. Imagine what it's like to kill someone with... with a machete. It?s been confirmed. They were bludgeoned and castrated before being killed. Ten from the Belgian contingent. No one helped them. The UN is the laughingstock here. OK, but put that on tonight's news. I?ll call soon. Why did you come back? You shouldn?t have. Gentille loved you. Why didn?t you take her far away? For three months I?ve asked myself that constantly. For three months a voice in me says I lost her out of pride and stupidity. I have to know, Agathe. I have to know. This is where he kept her. Who did? The man who took her. In his home? Some things it's best not to know. Look what I found. Gentille Sibomana, I ask for your hand. You already have it. I ask for your heart. It beats only for you. Before you, I was dead. I felt nothing. You saved my life. Promise me something. Anything. If they take me, kill me. Don?t let them rape and butcher me. Who is it? Maurice! Come in. A UN convoy is leaving in 15 minutes. Belgium recalled its remaining troops. The UN's best Peacekeepers. This is your last chance. No Rwandan can leave. She's Canadian, like me. She's my wife. She's Canadian! Please! She's with me. Canadian! This is my wife! We?re Canadians! Canadians! We?re married! I?m married. - He's my husband! - No, she's my wife. I?m Gentille Valcourt. No, we?re married! We?re married! Modeste! - Modeste! - Valcourt! We?re married. She's my wife. Look! Where's your marriage certificate? I beg you, Modeste! Look! Your wife is just a Tutsi whore and you?re nobody's boss now. So get back in the truck before you get the same. Bernard! Look at your whore! For the last time! You?re covered in blood, yet still you scorn me. Don?t stare! Think you?re better, but you?re nothing. Flesh for the hacking! That's all you are. You?ll finish in a mass grave. Promise me one thing. Take her away, far, far away from here. Promise me. Promise... Far away. D?sir?e? Gentille? No, don?t come near me. You shouldn?t have come. I want you to remember me differently. I?m not the woman you loved. I?m no longer a woman. I?ll die soon. Soon I?ll be with my family again. No. I?ll look after you. We?ll go to Canada. You?ll get help. You love me? Do you remember your promise? You have to help me leave, Bernard. Wait. Tell me how you laugh so easily. It's because it's so lovely and warm, and the beer tickles my mouth. Because the birds, because the sea, which I?ve never seen, because Canada, which I still may see, because the snow I never saw, and its infinite silence that I now know. Shall I go on?
