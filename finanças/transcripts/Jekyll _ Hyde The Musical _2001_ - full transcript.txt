(regal music) (wind whistling) (people chattering) (thunder rumbling) (gloomy music) (gentle music) - If you would have heard of Dr. Henry Jekyll, you would have heard appalling things. I tell you this, he was my friend and he was a seeker of truth. Radical theories, the life altering drugs were part of a search to illuminate the elements of goodness and evil, which are inherent in every human personality. Henry Jekyll believed he had found a way to control those separate elements, not merely for the furtherment of science, but for the relief of human sorrow and suffering. - He entered my life as a brilliant young scientist and became as dear to me as my own child. I came to feel the exhilaration of his knowledge and the profundity of his suffering as though they was mine. I came to understand Henry Jekyll. In a very real since his passion is consistently reenacted within every one of us. (gloomy music) - He's beyond help, Henry. - Therefore we treat him like an animal? He's a man, John. He has emotional responses as sensitive as any of ours, but the mind, the memory which allows him to express those emotions rebels now and refuses to serve him. I know there's a means to reintegrate mind and emotion, there must be. - Your colleagues tell me your theories are infinitely more dangerous than he is. They say you're trespassing on hallowed ground when you experiment with the human mind. - My colleagues are cowards, afraid of what they don't understand. How can we call ourselves civilized if we're not prepared to help him and every wretched soul like him? - He's lost, Henry, lost to himself and to the world. You will never reach him. - I have to try. - You have tried every-- - No, not true! John, John, I'm at the point of perfecting a formula, a combination of rare drugs-- - I admire your tenacity, Henry, but I question your philosophy. Do you seriously believe your drugs can change what God has set in motion? - Yes, yes, he can be changed, Sir Danvers. We shall all be changed, in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. (solemn music) ♫ Lost in the darkness ♫ Silence surrounds you ♫ Once there was morning ♫ Now endless night ♫ If I could reach you ♫ I'd guide you and teach you ♫ To walk from this darkness ♫ Back into the light ♫ Deep in your silence ♫ Please try to hear me ♫ I'll keep you near me ♫ Till night passes by ♫ I will find the answer ♫ I'll never desert you ♫ I promise you this ♫ Till the day that I die ♫ Goodnight, Father.

Sir Danvers Carew presiding. - [Danvers] Here. - Also in attendance His Grace, the Bishop of Basingstoke. - [Bishop] Yes. - The Right Honorable Sir Archibald Proops. - [Archibald] Yes. - [Stride] Lord Savage, Lady Beaconsfield, and General Lord Glossop. - Glossop, Glossop? - Yes and yourself, Mr. Stride? - Simon Stride, honorary secretary, respectfully recording the order of business. - I'm already late for two other board meetings. - Let's get on with it. (tapping) - Henry. Dr. Jekyll, the sole purpose for our extraordinary meeting is to permit you to explain the very unusual request that you've previously submitted to us in writing. (all arguing) Please, Dr. Jekyll's case is of particular interest to me as you all know. Let us, therefore, allow him to submit his request this one last time. - Distinguished governors, I'm obliged to thank you in advance for hearing me out in this matter of vital interest to any enlightened member of our society. - Dr. Jekyll, let us dispense with the niceties and proceed with the matter at hand. - Certainly, Mr. Stride. Forgive my good manners. Distinguished governors, in each of us there reside two separate natures, two distinct personalities, one dark, one light, one good, one evil. Now, it is the curse of mankind that these two extremes should be constantly at war. (governors arguing) - Henry, to the point. - It is clear to me now that we have the power to divide this primitive duality of man into its separate components, to isolate what is function from what is dysfunction and to control these element forever. My experiments with various animals have convinced me that this separation, the behavioral control of which I speak, is more than theoretical, it is achievable. I must now be permitted to test my formula and my theory on a human subject. - What, a human soul? - What, to be prodded and tested like a laboratory rat? - Yes, madam. Yes, gentleman, I ask that I be permitted to select a patient to help prove my theory for the betterment of all mankind, a volunteer I hope. - A volunteer mental patient, hmm, very good. - A man whom society has already abandoned as hopeless, an inmate of this prison. - Prison? Oh, Henry. - And you would perform your surgery on this pitiful creature's brain? - No, as I've already explained to this august body, my treatment takes the form of rare drugs precisely combined and administered through hypodermic injection. - What? ♫ There are doomed, broken souls in 1,000 asylums ♫ Left there to rot for the lack of a plan ♫ In the name of compassion and medical science ♫ I can save many lives if you give me one man ♫ I tell you now, the church will never sanction it ♫ Sacrilege, lunacy, blasphemy, heresy ♫ Beware sir, you're treading on dangerous ground ♫ In legal terms, I'd say extremely unsound ♫ Your lack of humility strikes me as odd ♫ What makes you think you have the right to play God ♫ The bishop speaks for all of us ♫ When he says you're playing God ♫ There's such a thing as ethics ♫ Over which you ride rough-shod ♫ You're a doctor, not a savior ♫ Doctor Jekyll, for a start ♫ But I judge from you behavior ♫ You can't tell the two apart ♫ Dear Mr. Stride, I am simply a scientist ♫ I have a code to which I remain true ♫ I don't presume to the stature of moralist ♫ I leave pretensions like that, sir, to you ♫ Henry, I've always encouraged your enterprise ♫ And I've been hopeful that you would succeed ♫ But given the problems my colleagues can visualize ♫ I see no choice but for you to concede ♫ I know my fate is yours to choose ♫ But if I fail, the world will lose ♫ When I am on the threshold of success ♫ I beg you, governors, you must say yes ♫ Doctor Jekyll, enough of your ranting, sir ♫ This is a hospital, here to save lives ♫ Do you think we would let you play havoc ♫ With all the high principles for which it strides ♫ Do you expect us to compromise all that we stand for ♫ Indulging your dangerous games ♫ Sacrifice all common sense for your dubious aims ♫ Can't you see I am not playing games ♫ Just give me the opportunity ♫ This whole thing's too bizarre ♫ Open up your eyes and see ♫ This man has gone too far ♫ Unless you listen to me ♫ Doctor, please watch your tone ♫ Damn it, man, can't you see you're on your own ♫ (governors arguing) - If I ever needed further justification for my work, gentlemen, you just have provided it! ♫ Just look at what has happened here ♫ Mix anger with a touch of fear ♫ The danger's all too crystal-clear ♫ Just look at you ♫ Our darker side keeps breaking through ♫ Observe it now in me and you ♫ The evil any man can do must be controlled ♫ I beg of you ♫ I'll show you all ♫ It can be done ♫ Here is a chance to take charge of our fate ♫ Deep down you must know tomorrow's too late ♫ One rule of life we cannot rearrange ♫ The only thing constant is change ♫ The only thing constant ♫ Is change ♫ (sighs) ♫ Distinguished colleagues, ♫ Your verdict, please ♫ All those in favor say "Aye" ♫ All those opposed, "Nay" ♫ Nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay ♫ Positively, absolutely nay ♫ - Sir Danvers? - I abstain. - By five votes to none with one abstention, Dr. Jekyll's extraordinary proposal is rejected. Thank you for your time, Doctor. - I am shocked to the core of my being. - Well, who's going to take me to luncheon, Bessie? - No, Teddy, I've heard enough demented babbling for one day. - This is England, you know, not the continent. - I'm profoundly sorry, Henry. I did try to prepare you. (gloomy music) - Well, you've finally convinced them that you're mad. - Oh, they set themselves up as friends of medicine, John, friends of knowledge, but they're not, they're hypocrites, they're hypocrites every last one of them. - Yes, but they're powerful hypocrites. You should exercise greater caution. - I can't afford caution! - Henry! Henry, you are obsessed by your father's condition. - Of course I'm obsessed, he's my father. I draw my life from him, the flesh upon my bones is his. John, John, I know I can save him and the thousands of others who dwell in the same darkness if they would only let me. ♫ How can I pursue the truth ♫ When they can block each step I take ♫ Henry, you have come too far ♫ Remember what you have at stake ♫ John, I know I'm right ♫ I must let my vision guide me ♫ But I'm so weary of this fight ♫ There's so little left inside me ♫ If you know that you are right ♫ Then you've got to see it through ♫ You've got to see it through ♫ Seven years ago I started out on this alone ♫ Now it's alone I'll see it through to its conclusion ♫ Who were they to judge what I am doing ♫ They know nothing of the endless possibilities I seek ♫ It's ludicrous I'm bound by their decision ♫ Seems vision is a word they've never heard ♫ If it mattered less, I'd treat them with derision ♫ It's absurd ♫ And yet the fact remains ♫ Those bastards hold the reins ♫ (applause) (energetic music) ♫ If you live around here ♫ You need cash in the bank ♫ 'Cause the houses 'round here ♫ Are all flashy and swank ♫ And the front bit ♫ Is what's called a facade ♫ If you live around here you need lots of panache ♫ If you live in town, dear ♫ Then you must cut a dash ♫ 'Tisn't hard, dear, to create a facade ♫ Here tonight it's festive ♫ But the guests are getting restive ♫ 'Cause the guest of honor's causing a dilemma ♫ Dr. Jekyll's tardy for his own engagement party ♫ His betrothal to Sir Danver's daughter, Emma ♫ (lighthearted music) - Absolute waste of time and who does this Jekyll fellow think he is? - Impertinence like that in the army would have earned him a good flogging. - The perfect way to stamp out any nasty signs of progress, aye General? - Absolutely. - He's tinkering with a man's soul and I don't like it. He's lucky we're living in modern times. Today's penalties for heresy are not what they should be. - Then he should thank the good lord that we have you to represent modern times, Your Grace. - If Jekyll's as clever as you say he is, what's he doing trying to save paupers and madmen? What possible use is that? I've lived in St. James for 60 years and I've never even seen a pauper let alone a madman. - I think he's mad, if you must know. Danvers, we're talking about your future son-in-law and I think you're mad to let him marry your daughter. - That's not father's decision, Lady Beaconsfield, it's mine. - Don't worry, Bessie. Whatever your opinion of him as a scientist may be, Emma assures me Henry Jekyll is impeccable husband material. - Well for a start, it is less than impeccable to be late for one's own engagement party. Shows a remarkable lack of style. - Yes. (clears throat) Bessie. - Comments on style should never be made by those who have none. - (laughs) Miss Carew. - Mr. Utterson, thank you so much for being here. - You are a gracing breath of fresh air. (gasps) ♫ Emma Carew, can this be you ♫ What kind of man is this you've taken ♫ Can you not see the kind of life that this would be ♫ You are mistaken ♫ Time to awaken before it's too late ♫ Before you forever determine your fate ♫ But, Simon, you knew ♫ I had to be free ♫ What I choose to do is decided by me ♫ - Emma! ♫ From the day my mother died ♫ My father, full of good intentions ♫ Treated me as though I were a young child ♫ Maybe his idea was just to wait until I grew up ♫ And then look at me and I hope that I'd be her ♫ It's easy to accept that from a father ♫ He'd rather things remain the way they were ♫ But when it comes to marriage ♫ I must pick whom I prefer ♫ I am not the weak young thing you're seeking, Simon ♫ Someone 17, obedient, and sweet ♫ I am not the protegee to waste your time on (gasps) ♫ I'm complete ♫ In Henry's eyes I see ♫ What I am meant to be ♫ Henry Jekyll, you're a devil ♫ You have robbed us of London's most lovely girl ♫ I could turn to drink when I stop to think ♫ - What? ♫ Emma's marrying a doctor instead of an earl ♫ Poor girl ♫ (laughs) - Ah, the late Dr. Jekyll. - My apologies, Sir Danvers. - Nothing to forgive, dear boy. Like Emma, I'm learning to anticipate you. We're sure to invite your wedding guests for the day after the ceremony just to make sure the groom is in attendance. - Never fear, sir, I'll be there. The six weeks till the wedding will be the longest of my life. - Well your half hour this afternoon with the governors of St. Judes was certainly the longest of my life. - I have to take every opportunity I am given, sir, to state my beliefs. - Even though you antagonize the established authority in the process? - But your friends are not the established authority, merely the established prejudice. - My friend Dr. Jekyll is a man of honor, Sir Danvers, but not of diplomacy. - Ah, I was not aware the two were incompatible. - Ladies and gentlemen, the fireworks. - Fireworks! Ladies and gentleman, do come along. Mr. Utterson, do you enjoy fireworks? - If they're unavoidable. - Yes, they are. Bishop, come along and have a glass of port. - Yes. (solemn music) - Miss Carew. - Dr. Jekyll. - Are you angry with me? - No. - You should be. - I'm just happy you're here. - Well I try never to miss any social occasion attended by Lady Beaconsfield. Tell me, is there a Lord Beaconsfield? - He died 30 years ago. - Sensible fellow. (giggles) Dearest Emma, you realize you're setting yourself up for a lifetime of these aggravations? - Yes, I realize that. - I cannot live by the same old clock other people do. - I realize that too. - And in all good conscience, I must advise you I love you far too much to have you suffer this sort of life I have to offer. ♫ I must go on with the work I'm committed to ♫ How can I not when my theories are true ♫ And I will prove, if I'm ever permitted to ♫ Things are not wrong just because they are new ♫ Henry, I adore you ♫ Always have done, always will do ♫ And your dreams are mine ♫ I will always understand ♫ However hard the path you've planned ♫ Our lives will intertwine ♫ Who knows where my work will lead me ♫ Nowhere where you will not need me ♫ Emma, please I beg you, heed me ♫ Just don't leave me on my own ♫ The only thing I fear is the unknown ♫ When this all began ♫ We knew there'd be a price to pay ♫ Too late now to turn away ♫ We have come too far ♫ I know we'll find a way ♫ Sometimes I see past the horizon ♫ Sure of my way where I am going ♫ But where's the prize I have my eyes on ♫ Where ♫ There is just no knowing ♫ And when despair tears me in two ♫ Who can I turn to but you ♫ You know who I am ♫ Take me as I am ♫ Look in my eyes ♫ Who do you see there ♫ Someone you know ♫ Or just a stranger ♫ If you are wise, you will see me there ♫ Love is the only danger ♫ Love meaning me ♫ Love meaning you ♫ We'll make that one dream come true ♫ You know who I am ♫ Take me as I am ♫ Though fate won't always do what we desire ♫ Still we can set the world on fire ♫ Give me your hand ♫ Give me your heart ♫ Swear to me we'll never part ♫ We'll never part ♫ You know who I am ♫ You know who I am ♫ This is who I am ♫ This is who I am ♫ Take me as I am ♫ (gentle music) (applause) - Emma. - Father. - You're being asked for. - So are you, Dr. Jekyll. Though I can't imagine why. - I fancy people are a bit curious to know why the two main reasons for this party are resolutely hiding from it. - Come along, Henry. Let's test your theories against these other lesser fireworks. (mysterious music) - I hope you gave him the scolding he deserves. - Did mother's scolding ever change you? (laughs) - I'm not alone in finding Henry's behavior difficult to tolerate. - Well you don't have to tolerate it, father. He's marrying me, not you. (laughs) ♫ Emma, don't you understand ♫ It's you that I'm concerned for ♫ Father, don't be, you should be concerned for him ♫ He's the one in need ♫ I'm only trying to protect you ♫ What else would you have your father do ♫ I think I would die if any harm should come to you ♫ I'm scared, my child, because I'm going to lose you ♫ I find it very hard to let you go ♫ Father ♫ If you try to, you could never lose me ♫ Darling father ♫ I still love you more than you will ever know ♫ But if we want our love to grow ♫ I know, in time, I have to let you go ♫ We mustn't be afraid of letting go ♫ - Oh, I love you, father. - I love you.

I know I'm late, but just-- - The others have been waiting for you. Get in there now and account for yourself to the Spider. - Just let me explain, I'll tell you-- - Because of you, girl! - Are we here? Is this it? Oh my goodness. - Welcome to The Red Rat, gentlemen. How good of you to pay us a call. ♫ Henry Jekyll, you're a devil ♫ Leading friends to a life of debauchery ♫ - Mr. Utterson, is it not? - Mr. Utterson. Why John. - Why John. - Why John. - As you can see, Gwenny, these two youngsters desperately need something to drink. - Leading friends to a life of debauchery. - I'm determined to drink and I will I think. (laughter) - [Man] Come along. - John, why on earth have you brought me here? - You need the relaxation, Henry. - He's right, Henry, you need relaxation. Table one and champagne for Mr. Utterson's party. The show is about to start, Henry. You will love the new girl. (laughs) (playful jazz music) - [Man] Wonderful! - [Woman] Nice job. (applause) (people chattering) - Oh, you know the only reason we don't have rats in this place is they wouldn't be caught dead here. - [Woman] Absolutely right. - Well, well, well, Lucy, it's about time you got here. - Oh look who it is, her royal majesty, queen of The Red Rat. (laughs) - You are in trouble, girl. We're running late and the Spider is in a foul mood. - Oh well that will make a nice change. - Oh don't upset him, Lucy. You know what the Spider can do. - Oh I suppose you've been up in Hyde Park again listening to all them speeches. - And what's wrong with that? I like to listen. I just want to learn. - Lucy, you're such a fool, filling your head with all that rubbish. - All you need to learn is to be on time. Now you get your ass out onto that stage. You got two minutes. I don't know who you girls-- - [Girls] Think you are! - Think you are. - Well don't worry, Gwenny, nor do we. (laughter) - I'd rather be nobody than her. - Ah, chin up, Lucy.

I'd like to help you if I could. You helped me tonight. - I did? - [Henry] Yes. - How? - With your song, Good and Evil. Made me think, we all do have choices to make, don't we? - Some of us do. So, what's your specialty then, hmm? - I'm a doctor. (laughs) Tonight... Tonight you made me realize I could be the patient as well. - (laughs) You're serious? - Yes. - Oh, I'm sorry. - No, no, no, it's quite alright. - It all sounds a bit weird to me.

You can't possibly. Where are you gong? - [Henry] My offices, I'm going to work tonight. I must. - You need to rest, Henry. Henry, you must. (gentle music) Sir? Promise me you're not contemplating a volunteer from The Red Rat. - Good heavens, John, you think I'm such an unprincipled character. Poole, send him straight to bed, he must have rest.

An unexpected development. Free! (dramatic music) ♫ What is this feeling of power and drive ♫ I've never felt it, felt so alive ♫ Where does this feeling of power derive ♫ Making me know why I'm alive ♫ Like the night, it's a secret ♫ Sinister dark and unknown ♫ Oh, I do not know what I seek ♫ Yet I'll seek it alone ♫ I have a thirst I cannot deprive ♫ Never have I felt so alive ♫ There is no battle I couldn't survive ♫ Feeling like this, feeling alive ♫ Like the moon, an enigma ♫ Lost and alone in the night ♫ Damned by some heavenly stigma ♫ But blazing with light ♫ It's a feeling of being alive ♫ Full of evil, but truly alive ♫ It's a truth that cannot be denied ♫ It's a feeling of being Edward Hyde ♫ (applause) - I'm so sorry, Miss Carew. Perhaps next week. - No, Poole, I won't come again. Not until Dr. Jekyll asks for me. - Emma. - [Emma] Father. - Oh, he asks about you constantly, Miss Carew, but he's not seen anybody, not for weeks now because of his work. - Because of his work. Yes, I know. Show him the flowers, Poole, and the nourishing things I brought. If you can get his attention, say they are to remind him that there is more in his life than his work, myself for example. - Emma, so you won't come here again until he emerges? - I won't. - This is absurd. He's sacrificing everything valuable in his life to this experiment. - The experiment is the most valuable thing in his life. - Yes, after you. - No! No, father, before me. Now, I understand that. Are you coming along with me or are you staying? - I am coming along of course. I'm just trying to persuade Mr. Utterson that he's wasting his time. - I did not wish to alarm Miss Carew, sir, and it is hardly my place to criticize the doctor, but for more than a week now he's been locked in that laboratory. I'm instructed to leave his meals at the door and go away. - He's been alone in there all this time? - Alone, sir? No. - But if you're forbidden to admit anyone. - I did not admit him, sir. The doctor must have let him in. I would not have admitted a man of that sort to the doctor's home. I saw him here just once standing in front of the fire, staring at his reflection. He told me to clear out and not disturb him and the doctor again. But later, that same night-- - What? - I heard the doctor, or someone, in the laboratory there crying, weeping. The strangest sound you ever heard, sir. - [Henry] Poole! - Sir? - I have been ringing for a quarter of an hour! (breathing heavily) Go to Mr. Bisset, the pharmacist, and fetch me back these drugs. Now! John! - Henry. Good lord, what is the matter with you? - Now! - You look as if you're in the grip of the very devil. - There's something you must do for me. (gentle music) John, there are three letters here, one for Emma, one for her father, and one for you. If I should be taken ill or have to go away for awhile without otherwise alerting you, everything you will want to know are in these letters. - If you should go away? What are you saying? I won't accept these. - John! John, you're my lawyer. More importantly, you're my friend. You must do this for me. - And you, my dear Henry, must reexamine your priorities. ♫ You have your work and nothing more ♫ You are possessed ♫ What is your demon ♫ You've never been this way before ♫ You've lost the fire you built your dream on ♫ There's something strange, there's something wrong ♫ I see a change ♫ It's like when hope dies ♫ I, who have known you for so long ♫ I see the pain in your eyes ♫ There was a time ♫ Have I become ♫ My work and nothing more ♫ I know that's not ♫ What I'm living for ♫ Father, you know Henry won't just walk away ♫ The only way he knows is straight ahead ♫ Emma, you've not heard a single word I've said ♫ My fear is he's in over his head ♫ He could lose control ♫ And that I dread ♫ There has been talk ♫ They say he's gone too far ♫ He's locked himself away in his own world ♫ Pursuing this insanity ♫ It is his work ♫ It's more than work ♫ He is obsessed, the man is driven ♫ Just give him time, I ask no more ♫ His work's a crime to be forgiven ♫ There's something strange ♫ Just give him time ♫ Unless I'm blind ♫ I see a change of a bizarre kind ♫ He's chasing dreams he'll never find ♫ Father ♫ Who are they to judge what I am doing ♫ They know nothing of the endless possibilities I see ♫ Time to awaken before it's too late ♫ There's not at all, don't be unkind ♫ The problem's all in your mind ♫ I pray I may ♫ Henry, I will pray for you ♫ I pray he may find his way ♫ I pray every day that you may find your way ♫ Find his way ♫ (all singing) (applause) - A young lady to see you, sir. - Send her away, Poole. - Indeed, sir. She's dressed little enough like a lady. No doubt she found your card dropped on the street somewhere. - My card? - Yes, sir. - I will see her now. - Yes, sir. (lighthearted bells) (clears throat) - Good morning, miss. - Good morning. - Miss? - Lucy. - [Henry] Lucy. - Lucy Harris. I'm the one that you and your friend met that night. - Oh yes, I didn't. Yes, I remember. Please, sit down. (clears throat) (springs squeaking) (giggles) What brings you here? - You said if I ever needed a friend. - Yes, I remember. (solemn music) (clear throat) Good god. - Pretty, isn't it? - Who on earth would do such a thing? - A real English gentleman. Did a lovely job, didn't he? - Just one moment. (groans) - Some men are real skillful when it comes to causing pain. - [Henry] You didn't go to the police? - (chuckles) The police? A girl like me making a complaint about a man like him, a rich man? (chuckles) That's funny. I won't forget his name in a hurry though. Hyde. Edward Hyde. - Why come to me? You have family, don't you? - No, I ain't got no family. You gave me your card. - Yes, yes, of course, I remember. - I've never had someone like you be nice to me before. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. (solemn music) ♫ Sympathy, tenderness ♫ Warm as the summer ♫ Offer me their embrace ♫ Friendliness, gentleness ♫ Strangers to my life ♫ They are there in his face ♫ Goodness and sweetness ♫ And kindness abound in this place ♫ - There. You should feel more comfortable. - I feel like a lady. - You are a lady, most extraordinary lady. ♫ I am in love with the things that I see in his face ♫ It's a memory I know time will never erase ♫ - Good morning. ♫ I peer through windows ♫ Watch life go by ♫ Dream of tomorrow and wonder why ♫ The past is holding me, keeping life at bay ♫ I wander, lost in yesterday ♫ Wanting to fly ♫ But scared to try ♫ But if someone like you ♫ Found someone like me ♫ Then suddenly, nothing would ever be the same ♫ My heart would take wing ♫ And I'd feel so alive ♫ If someone like you found me ♫ So many secrets I've longed to share ♫ All I have needed is someone there ♫ To help me see a world ♫ I've never seen before ♫ A love to open every door ♫ To set me free ♫ So I can soar ♫ If someone like you ♫ Found someone like me ♫ Then suddenly, nothing would ever be the same ♫ There'd be a new way to live ♫ And a new life to love ♫ If someone like you found me ♫ Oh, if someone like you ♫ Found someone like me ♫ Then suddenly, nothing would ever be the same ♫ My heart would take wing ♫ And I'd feel so alive ♫ If someone like you ♫ Loved me ♫ Loved me ♫ Loved me ♫ (applause) - I hope everything was to your satisfaction, your grace. - Very nice, yes. - Sweet little girl, isn't she plenty of potential? - Very, very nice, yes. I'd, um, like to see her again. Next week? - Certainly, your grace, happy to oblige. Must make a pleasant change from all your charity work. But of course we do not do it for charity. (chuckles) - Oh yes. - Wednesday alright? - Wednesday very, very nice, yes. Goodbye for now, my dear. - Say cheerio to his grace. Never mind her. She's stunned by your generosity, that is all. Till Wednesday then. (speaks foreign language) (laughter) - [Man] Wednesday, dearest. - Your grace. Warms the heart to see that romance still blossoms even in the sewers of London. - Who are you? - What a pretty pair, the Romeo of the Cloth and the Juliet of the Gutter, though perhaps Juliet a trifle young for such a disgusting old Romeo. - How dare you, sir. Do you know who I am? - Yes, your grace. Yes, I know exactly who you are. Emanate churchman and philanthropist, friend to those in need, particularly of the female gender, only years still tender. - Let me pass you, fool! - Who does not know Rupert 14th Bishop of Basingstoke? (yells) Our fair city's most distinguished, degenerate, obscene, corrupt, and malignant hypocrite!

He would not tell us where he was going. Perhaps he no longer knew himself. The burden he placed on me was unbearable. I was a blind witness, allowed to hear his cries of anguish, forbidden to seek him, to understand, or to help. - Forbidden to see or speak to him for weeks. Dr. Jekyll had become like a son to me, not merely a presumptive son-in-law. Some kind of dark web was being cast around him and those connected to his work at St. Judes. I could not allow Emma and Henry to get caught up in that web.

The drugs? - All but two of them, sir. You know, I could lose my license. - When I can I have the others? - Tomorrow night. - Tomorrow? - Yes, sir, what are they for? - It's none of your bloody business. - No, sir. Of course not, sir.

(woman laughs) - Well, well, well, if it isn't faith, hope, and charity. - You! - And who in perdition are you, sir? - No one you would know, Sir Archibald, Lady Beaconsfield, Your Lordship. - Bessie, get inside. - Sweet how you hypocrites hang together. - Scandalous. Step aside you, you creature. This is my final admonition. - And this is mine.

Now, I, I, I don't know what you heard, Danvers. But I did everything I could. I tried to save them, all of them. Tried like hell. - Of course you did. That's a matter between you and God.

I was desperate for some word. - And you thought you would find it spying on my journal! - Henry. Henry, look at me. I cannot believe that either one of us has become so altered that we aren't able to have a civil conversation. I understand your work is unprecedented and painful. I see what it is doing to you. To us. And yet I know you must move forward. You believe in this so strongly. - It's gone beyond, Emma. It's like an addiction. And yet the truth, oh god, the truth is inside there somewhere. I can't explain it to myself much less to you, but I know the truth is in there. - There's no need to explain anything.

The beast has taken a heavy toll, not only on me who can yet be saved, but on others who cannot. The transformations are starting to recur of their own accord. John! John, please, leave me alone. I told you I must work. - You must give me some answers first. What is the meaning of this document? Who is Edward Hyde? - [Henry] Wha? - Why in God's name would you bequeath to him everything that you possess? - Those letters were only to be opened in the event-- - Only if you were to go away or became ill! You have gone away, Henry, and clearly you are ill. Who is Edward Hyde? - A colleague inextricably involved in the experiment. If I should be unable to complete it, he should have the wherewithal to finish my work. - If I am to act as your lawyer and your friend, you must tell me everything. - I have. - [John] Henry, please. - I've told you everything. - [John] Henry! - Everything I can comprehend. Everything I can comprehend myself. John, and now I must ask you an even greater favor. - Tell me! (gentle piano music) - Bisset, the chemist, has acquired a quantity of rare drugs for my immediate use. They are to be delivered to your offices the instant he has them. - No! - And then you must bring them here. Please, no further questions! John, John, I dare not leave this room until the next step is accomplished. You must trust me a few more days. - I trust you with my life, Henry. I suppose I must trust you with your own. - Yes, old friend, my life is in the balance, many lives are in the balance, all our lives. His life too. He wreaks his vengeance on a contemptible world, then disappears within me like a stain of breath upon a mirror. He's found the perfect hiding place.

I must go away for awhile. Friend and I have a little dispute to settle. - Be nice to him, Lucy, be nice. - What? Glad to see me go? - Oh no, sir. - I can always tell when you are lying, Lucy. - When do you come back? - Oh, it shouldn't take long and I'll know exactly where you are every minute I'm away and God help you if you're not here waiting for me when I return. ♫ I feel your fingers ♫ Cold on my shoulder ♫ Your chilling touch as it runs down my spine ♫ Watching your eyes ♫ As they invade my soul ♫ Forbidden pleasures ♫ I'm afraid to make mine ♫ At the touch of your hand ♫ At the sound of your voice ♫ At the moment your eyes meet mine ♫ I am out of my mind, I am out of control ♫ Full of feelings I can't define ♫ It's a sin with no name ♫ Like a hand in a flame ♫ And the senses proclaim ♫ It's a dangerous game ♫ A darker dream ♫ That has no ending ♫ That's so unreal ♫ You believe that it's true ♫ A dance of death ♫ Out of a mystery tale ♫ The frightened princess ♫ Doesn't know what to do ♫ Will the ghosts go away ♫ No ♫ Will she will them to stay ♫ No ♫ Either way, there's no way to win ♫ All I know is I'm lost ♫ No ♫ And I'm counting the cost ♫ No ♫ My emotions are in a spin ♫ No ♫ I don't who's to blame ♫ It's a crime and a shame ♫ But it's true all the same ♫ It's a dangerous game ♫ No one speaks ♫ Not one word ♫ But all the words are in our eyes ♫ Silence ♫ Silence speaks ♫ Loud and clear ♫ Loud and clear ♫ All the words we don't want to hear ♫ At the touch of your hand ♫ At the sound of your voice ♫ At the moment your eyes meet mine ♫ I am losing my mind ♫ I am losing control ♫ Full of feelings I can't define ♫ It's a sin with no name ♫ No remorse and no shame ♫ Fire, fury, and flame ♫ 'Cause the devil's to blame ♫ And the angels proclaim ♫ It's a dangerous game ♫ (solemn music) (gloomy music) ♫ If you live around here ♫ Lots of people, I fear ♫ Will make promises ♫ They will not honor, my dear ♫ And the truth is ♫ You end up getting scarred ♫ There's a beast at the door ♫ And he's wild and free ♫ But we won't let him in ♫ 'Cause we don't want to see ♫ What is lurking ♫ Right behind ♫ The facade ♫ (applause) (solemn music) - Henry? - Henry Jekyll is not available. - Devil. - No use waiting, Mr. Utterson. I don't expect the doctor anytime soon. - I am here on his explicit instructions to bring these drugs. - Leave the drugs and go. - I will live them only with Dr. Jekyll. (groans) Where is he? (laughs) - Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me. - Either you tell me where he is or I will send for the authorities. Choice is yours, Mr. Hyde. (laughs) Yes, I know who you are and I can see that Henry has good reason to be frightened of you. What have you done with him? - What have I done with him? What has he done with me? (breathes laboriously) Allow me to show you, John. (cackles) What's the matter? You afraid of science, huh? You afraid of the truth? (laughs) - Oh! (groans) (dramatic music) (sighs) Henry Jekyll, dear God! - John, John. John. Hyde was right. You're afraid. - I'm appalled. - But I warned you. Even as Hyde, I warned you. - Oh my god, Henry, you have destroyed yourself. - Perhaps. Perhaps, but only so that I may save and redeem my father and the thousands of others who inhabit this same uninhabitable hell. John, John. Hyde is a part of me freed from within, but he's returned within where I can subdue him. But there's no time. You must listen to me. I still may yet be able to regain control. Here, there's one more task you must accomplish for me. - Lucy Harris. - Tell her to read it at once. - The girl from The Red Rat? - Yes, read it to her if necessary. She must leave London immediately. - God save my soul. - Her life hangs in the balance as does mine. - Is it your message I'm taking? Or his? - If you knew him, you wouldn't ask. Now go on, John, go on! With these ingredients, I have one final chance to regain control and to save myself. Go on, John, go on, go on! - God help us all! - [Henry] Go on! ♫ Somehow I've got to get back ♫ To the place where my journey started ♫ Find the course I charted ♫ When I first departed ♫ Somehow I've got to hang on to the vision ♫ That first inspired me ♫ And the hope that fired me ♫ When the world admired me ♫ I'll find a way back to the higher ground ♫ And see the view I saw before ♫ I'll search the world until the answer's found ♫ Turn my despair around ♫ Forevermore ♫ Somehow I've got to rebuild ♫ All the dreams that the winds have shattered ♫ From what fate has shattered ♫ I'll retrieve what mattered ♫ Somehow I've got to hang on ♫ Till the evil has been defeated ♫ Till my work's completed ♫ I will not be cheated ♫ God, you must help me carry on ♫ When it seems all hope has gone ♫ I have got to carry on ♫ (applause) (thunder rumbling) (gentle music) (laughs) - No fear, sir. You won't have disturbed nobody. They're used to late visitors around here. - This is from Dr. Jekyll. You are to leave London at once, tonight if possible. May I? My dear Miss Lucy. I regret more than I can ever express, that my private misfortunes prevent me from ever seeing you again. I have found in you a tender and loving light during these past dark days. I hope you will accept enclosed as a small repayment for the lesson you have taught me. Leave this place, I beg you, and begin again, secure in the knowledge that I shall never forget you. Henry Jekyll. - He don't owe me nothin', I owe him. - That is not my concern. But I beseech you to do as he asks. I am sure it's for the best. - Now, why didn't he come? Why did you? - Because he is my friend. (gentle music) - Yes. I suppose he's mine too. - Believe it. Goodnight then and good luck. May you find a happier life elsewhere.

No, no, no, Henry Jekyll's such a very busy man. - You know Dr. Jekyll? - Know him? - Oh, we're close, Lucy, we're very close. We share everything, he and I, just as you and I do, my sweet everything. Leave this place, I beg you? You weren't planning on leaving the city without saying goodbye, were you? - No, sir, I'm not going anywhere. - No. No, no, you're not going anywhere. Come here, come. Close. No, no, no, closer. Closer, yes. ♫ Sympathy (yells) ♫ Tenderness (groans) ♫ Warm as the summer ♫ Offer you their embrace ♫ Friendliness, gentleness ♫ Strangers to my life ♫ They are there in this face ♫ Goodness and sweetness ♫ And kindness ♫ Abound in this place ♫ (cackles) (dramatic music) (solemn music) ♫ Lost in the darkness ♫ Silence surrounds you ♫ Once there was morning ♫ Now endless night ♫ I will find the answer ♫ I'll never desert you ♫ I promise you this ♫ Till the day that I ♫ Do you really think that I would ever let you go ♫ Do you think I'd ever set you free ♫ If you do, I'm sad to say, it simply isn't so ♫ You will never get away from me ♫ All that you are is a face in the mirror ♫ I close my eyes and you disappear ♫ I'm what you face when you face in the mirror ♫ Long as you live, I will still be here ♫ All that you are is the end of a nightmare ♫ All that you are is a dying scream ♫ After tonight, I shall end this demon's dream ♫ This is not a dream, my friend ♫ And it will never end ♫ This one is the nightmare that goes on ♫ Hyde is here to stay ♫ No matter what you may pretend ♫ And I'll flourish long after you're gone ♫ Soon you will die and my silence will hide you ♫ You cannot choose but to lose control ♫ You can't control me, I live deep inside you ♫ Each day you'll feel me devour your soul ♫ I don't need you to survive as you need me ♫ I'll become whole as you dance with death ♫ And I'll rejoice as you breathe your final breath ♫ I'll live inside you forever ♫ No ♫ Satan himself by my side ♫ No ♫ And I know that now and forever ♫ They'll never be able to separate ♫ Jekyll from Hyde (yells) ♫ Can't you see it's over now, time to die ♫ No, not I, only you ♫ If I die, you'll die too ♫ You'll die in me and I'll be you ♫ Damn you, Hyde ♫ Set me free ♫ Can't you see you are me ♫ No, deep inside ♫ I am you, you are Hyde ♫ - No, never.

(thunder rumbling) (applause) (gloomy music) ♫ There's a beast at the door ♫ And he's wild and free ♫ But we don't let him in ♫ 'Cause we don't want to see ♫ What is lurking ♫ Right behind the facade ♫ Man is not one, but two ♫ He is evil and good ♫ And he walks the fine line that he'd cross if he could ♫ And he's waiting ♫ He's just waiting ♫ - Henry had entered the very gates of hell and seen what lay beyond. His search for the truth had come to nothing. He knew he must leave his father and his unending darkness. - Yet, back from the dead he came to the sound of wedding bells, ready to embrace the next and we hope much happier chapter of his life. ♫ Dear lord and father of mankind ♫ Forgive our foolish ways ♫ Re-clothe us in our rightful mind ♫ In purer lives thy service find ♫ In deeper reverence praise ♫ In deeper reverence praise ♫ Drop thy still dews of quietness ♫ Till all our strivings cease ♫ Take from our souls the strain and stress ♫ And let our ordered lives confess ♫ The beauty of thy peace ♫ The beauty of thy peace ♫ - Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. If any man can show any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together let him now speak or else hereafter forever hold his peace. Henry John Albert Jekyll, (gloomy music) do you take this woman-- - [John] Henry? - [Bishop] Emma Alice Margarette Carew. - [John] What is it? - Henry? - Oh god, oh god. Oh god, not now, please, someone, please take the pain away! Oh, feel it fill me! Oh god, feel it kill me! Oh god, will me somehow to fight, I pray! Oh god, have mercy! Don't let her see me look like this, not on my wedding day, not on my wedding day! (grunts) (breathes laboriously) Mr. Stride. I trustfully respect you are recording the order of business! - [Danvers] In God's name, Dr. Jekyll! - There is no Dr. Jekyll, only Edward Hyde. - [Emma] Henry. - Oh god. - Henry, it's alright. (yelling) - [John] Hyde, she has nothing to do-- - No one, no one touches Edward Hyde or before God she dies. - [Danvers] Emma! - No one touches Edward Hyde. - Henry. (gentle music) Henry, I know that it is you. And you would never harm me. There. (breathes heavily) - Emma? Oh god, oh god. Go on, go on, go on. (yelling) (gloomy music) Go on, John, do it. Do it, John. Please, do it. Set me free, set me free. Set us all free, just do it, John. - I cannot. (grunting) (dramatic music) - Father. - Oh, Henry. Henry. - Emma. - Shh, rest. - Emma. - Rest now. My tormented love. Shh. (solemn music) ♫ You are free now ♫ You're with me now ♫ Where you'll always be ♫ (applause) (dramatic music) (regal music) (cheering and applause) - Thank you! Whoo! (laughs) No day at the beach. Did you like the show, did you like the show? (cheering and applause) Please. Please tell your friends and I wanted to personally say on camera thank you to the people at the Plymouth Theater and SFX and mostly the cast and crew who kind of spoon fed me 'cause I've come a long way from the beach and the talking car. (laughter) (cheering and applause) And it took me a long time to get here and I'm not leaving! Thank you for making my dream come true. Good night everybody! Hope you enjoyed the show! (dramatic music) (playful music) (gloomy music) ♫ There's a face that we wear ♫ In the cold light of day ♫ It's society's mask, it's society's way ♫ And the truth is that it's all a facade ♫ There's a face that we hide till the nighttime appears ♫ And what's hiding inside behind all of our fears ♫ Is our true self ♫ Locked inside the facade ♫ Every day ♫ People in their own sweet way ♫ Like to add a coat of paint ♫ And be what they ain't ♫ That's how our little game is played ♫ Livin' out a masquerade ♫ Actin' a bizarre charade ♫ While playing the saint ♫ At the end of the day, they don't mean what they say ♫ They don't see what they mean ♫ They don't ever come clean ♫ And their answer ♫ Is it's all a facade, is it's all a facade ♫ Man is not one, but two ♫ He is evil and good ♫ And he walks a fine line ♫ We'd all cross if we could ♫ It's a nightmare ♫ We can never discard ♫ So we stay on our guard ♫ Though we love the facade ♫ What's behind the facade ♫ Look behind the facade ♫
