We've been patrolling for ages. Are these guns just for show, or are we ever going to actually use them? That's what Dayal Sir's wife says, too. Is the gun just for show, or will you actually use it? -What was that, Biswa? -We're just kidding, sir. Don't get cheeky with me. Sorry, sir. Section, take cover! -Fire ahead! Two o'clock! -They're firing from the front! -Take your positions! -Take cover! Biswa! Take positions! Take cover! Sir, we've got you! Get the first aid kit! One for 15, come in! 15 for 1. Pass message. Over. Enemy fire at check-post two and three! Over! Confirm enemy fire. Over. Heavy fire! There are enemy soldiers hiding in the valley ahead! We'll handle them, but Subedar Dayal is badly wounded. He can't go any further. We need emergency evacuation. Over. Roger that! Wing Commander Singh, there's an emergency evacuation. We have 30 minutes. -Prepare your chopper. Over. -Pick-up coordinates? Kilo valley. South of Tololing. Closest helipad at GR12344323. Over. Copied. Chopper for CASEVAC will be airborne in seven minutes. It's an emergency CASEVAC. Get two choppers ready. All the pilots are out on their missions. Who's going to go? Gunju! Dada, let me look. Gunju, let me sleep. -Dada, please let me look! -Gunju, please let me sleep! Juice? Come. Come! Do you want to fly the plane? Okay. Hold this. When I say left, you steer left. Slowly. Okay? Ready? One, two… three… left. Can I sit there? To sit here, you need to be a pilot. Pilot. Gunju! You look blind in these goggles! -Dada, I want to be a pilot. -And I want to be Kapil Dev. I'm serious. I want to be a pilot. Girls don't become pilots. You know what girls can be? Here. Hold this and ask, "Sir, veg or non-veg?" Come on. "This aircraft has four emergency exits. Two in the front and two in the back." And from which exit would you like to be thrown out? -Papa, she wants to be a pilot. -So? -As if girls can be pilots. -Really? Which buffoon has taught you this? Don't pay attention to him, love. Whether it's a man or a woman flying the plane, they're both called pilots. And if the plane doesn't care who's flying it, why should you? You can be anything you like. -But first, complete… -My education! Yes. And, you… 20 squats. Why? From the moment I saw you I just can't get you out of my head I lost my head And now I just keep following you around Gunju! How can you be a pilot if you're scared of heights? Come on! Fly! Jump! Wherever you are There I'll be Excellent! I can't help it Now and forever I'm tied to you I'm tied to you Who wears goggles at night? Pilots can't risk damage to their eyes. Gone case. Push and pull Cut and tear This bond we share Can't be broken From sunny days To misty nights This bond we share is forever Wherever you are There I'll be All my roads lead me to you I can't help it Now and forever I'm tied to you I'm tied to you I'm tied to you I'm tied to you Gunjan, I passed! With 42 percent. Can you believe it? What's wrong? Did you fail? Ninety-four percent. So, why are you sad? -What's this? -Have a look. What do I say at home after getting 94 percent? That I don't want to study, I want to be a pilot? Okay, do one thing. Don't be scared, just go to your dad. Just be like, "Papa, girls my age are only chasing boys, but I just want to chase my dreams. Am I not the best daughter in the world?" And Papa will agree? -No! He's going to lose it! -This is no time for jokes, Mannu! Look, Gunju. If you speak up, you're going to get some flak. But if you don't, you'll always regret it. Let's go. You owe me a treat. -Congratulations! -Congratulations, my dear! -Very well done, dear! -Great work! Gunjan, congratulations! Very well done! Ma! My sweetheart, my darling, my topper is here! What is all this? Your dad decided to celebrate your result. -Why? -Go and change your clothes. -Quickly! -But where is Papa? Cheers! -Gunjan is the pride of Lucknow. -She's brilliant. She loves studying. She's never without a book. She's made us proud. -Cheers! -Congratulations! Ma! -Ma! -Kirti! -Kirti, listen! -Hold on. Can you take Dabboo to the bathroom? He's about to wet himself! -I need to speak to you. -Come, baby, let's go. Keep it in! Congrats. Gunju! Look, it's Topper Gunju! -What is it? -I have to tell you something important. Gunju, it's our song. We'll talk later. Come on. Give it up for Topper Gunju! Gunju! She's going to dance to our favorite song. This is her favorite song. Gunju! Where are you going? Dada, I… Dada, I don't want to go to college. Dada, I don't want to go to college. Pilot… Pilot… Dada, I want to leave school and go to Delhi to be a pilot! Have you lost your mind? Grow up, Gunju. Focus on college now. We'll figure it out later. But I don't need to go to college to be a pilot. You don't? Do you know the hardships we've faced? I know! You were extremely poor. -I've heard it 100 times. -You learned nothing from it. My family was too poor to send me to college. And this one is rejecting the opportunity! Wonderful! -Ma, relax. She isn't going anywhere. -Why not? I want to do this. Why are you guys being so-- You're going to live in Delhi by yourself? Dada, you joined the Army. Why can't I be a pilot? Fine, be a pilot. Go away. Do what you want. Maybe I should leave and go away. What's all this drama? She's going to fly a plane, and I'm going to my mother's house. For now, maybe you should handle the guests. Let me handle her. Go. Go on. Children shouldn't be allowed such freedom. -No one understands that anymore. -What's all the murmuring about? Go. Go join your friends. Very good. They're kids. All kids have fights. The good news is that everything is under control… except Mr. Khanna. Come now, let's get the music back on. Thank God, Gunju agreed. She agreed, right? No. I agreed. Mr. Saxena, drink? Tenth grade… 94 percent. Twelfth grade… -Where's your 12th grade report card? -I don't have it. So, get it. -But I haven't done 12th grade. -So, do it. Isn't passing 10th grade the minimum requirement? It was. Now, it's 12th grade. You should've done your homework before coming here and wasting my time. Come on. Next! Everything happens for the best. The astrologer said that Gunju will forget all this in two years. She'll even finish college. She's going to be a pilot, no matter what. Whose side are you on? I'm just on this side. Twelfth grade… 87 percent. Very good. And… Where's your college diploma? I don't have it. So, do it. But the minimum requirement was to pass 12th grade, right? It was. Now it's college diploma. Come on. Next! The astrologer said it's very simple. We go to the temple every Monday, offer two coconuts, and in three years, she'll get over this pilot nonsense. Listen… When will you get over this astrologer nonsense? I'm-- I'm on this side. Good night. Here's 10th, 12th, and college diploma. All done. Thank you so much. We're filled with gratitude. Take this to Mr. Shrivastava at the admissions counter. Fill out the admission form, and deposit ten lakh rupees. Why ten? The course fee is five lakhs. That was five years ago. With petrol prices doubling, how can the course fees remain the same? Come on. Next! Just a second, sir. Why ten lakhs for a three-year course? The course is three years, but it takes six or seven years to finish it. Are you just going to sit here asking questions or will you apply for admission? I've been saying it from the start, everything happens for the best. Where would we get ten lakh rupees from? Even if we had managed, she'd be in training for six years, then get a job. When would she get married? It's good. I won't get married. Until I become a pilot, I won't do anything. What nonsense is she saying? Papa, is there really no way to arrange the money? Of course there is! I have an idea, Mr. Saxena. Sell this house. Okay? The madam can fly planes, while we sleep on the street. Hey… -Good morning, Gunjan! -What is this Sugar Scandal? Sit. Look. Is Gunju up? Yes. Here, have some rice. Ma… -Could you pass the dal? -Of course. Here you go. -You aren't eating anything. -I wanted to eat a little light today. -Ma… -Yes, dear? Ma, I don't want to be a pilot. You see? The astrologer was right. -Thank the Lord. -I'm joining the Air Force. What? Look at this, Ma. What is this? I see. Join the Indian Air Force, apply for the first ever batch of… Yes. Girls are allowed for the first time. Wonderful. Patriotism is in your blood. I'm proud of you… both. She's not a patriot. She just wants to fly planes. Gunju, grow up! The form's been filled. -And you said nothing. -He's the one who filled it. Huh? Yes. Incredible. If she can't be a pilot, then Air Force. If not the Air Force, maybe an astronaut? And if NASA doesn't take her, maybe she can be Superman. If even that fails, Gunju, why don't you inflate yourself like a balloon and float away. Do whatever you like. Because there's no one here who'll stop you, right? -I'm done. -Don't leave your food like that. No. I told you I'm eating light today. Done packing? Sit. -What time is your train? -Tomorrow morning, 4:45 a.m. Here. If I can drink with you, I should be able to talk freely with you. Go ahead. Papa, ever since Gunju was born, you've indulged her every whim. When we were kids, we didn't let anyone's sister play cricket with us. But you made us include Gunju with the boys. You let her go to the cinemas late at night. You never limited her in any way. And now, you're letting her join the Air Force? You were in the Army. You know how tough it is there. Papa, I love her, and I do want to see her happy. But right now, her happiness is not as important as her safety. It seems like you're not considering her safety. Don't you think you're putting her in harm's way, in the pursuit of happiness? I think… you shouldn't drink. Good night. Thank you, sir. Next! Go! Listen up! If you want to join the Air Force, you have to be a soldier first, or else, go sit in the kitchen. Understood? Next. Yes! Next! Go! Who can tell me the color of the Ashoka Chakra? Sir! Number 96. Stand up. What is the color of the Ashoka Chakra? Sir, blue. The Ashoka Chakra is black. What is it? Black. Yes, sir. The Ashoka Chakra is black. Sit down. Sir? Yes? The Ashoka Chakra is blue. So you're going to teach me about the Ashoka Chakra? Yes, sir. Fear makes you make mistakes. The Ashoka Chakra is… blue, of course. How can it be black? Sit down. Climb up. Look outside. Jump. -Jump! -Sir? Please, it's too high. Sir, I'm scared of heights. -I said, jump! -Sir, I won't jump! -Sir, I'll do anything else. -Stop! Jump! Jump! Next! Discuss two Indian major current affairs topics. Two lakh people have been evacuated from Surat because of the pneumonic plague… …which is the worst plague in the last ten years. Already… …25 people have died… …and 150 are sick. That… According to unofficial sources… …100 people have lost their lives. Sir, Sugar Scandal? What do you have to say about the Sugar Scandal? The Sugar Scandal is known as a huge scandal… The country has suffered huge losses. Because of this, our country's… It is… Do you know anything about our country? Anything, sir? Anything is better than nothing. The hit song from this year… "Baby, it's Cold Outside, But Warm in Here" is attracting a lot of controversy. Many of India's intellectuals have taken issue with the lyrics. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Koun, there's been a 250% rise in the sale of Pomeranian dogs, and Tuffy the dog has reportedly signed three more films. -Enough. -As the lead. Thank you. -You can leave. -Thank you, sir. So, Mr. Mishra… What do you think? Sir, Tuffy gave a great performance in that film. Hello, everyone. Please settle down. So, the results of this SSB were quite poor. The performances are not up to the mark. Unfortunately, this means we can't select many candidates. Number four. Chest Number 4? Number 4! -Is there Chest Number 4 here? -Yes, sir. You may go for your medicals. The rest of you… Next time, work harder. Thank you. Congratulations. Congratulations. Morning, sir. I, X, U, Y, T, H, Y, M, X, V. One-sixty-four. Take a deep breath. How do you feel? I can't believe it, ma'am. I swung from a rope, Papa, just like Tarzan! Wonderful! And the medical? Medicals are done. There's just some formalities left. Okay, come home soon, my Tarzan. I'm going to get a truck full of ice cream for you. Chest Number 4! Okay, Papa, I have to go. I'll see you at home. Okay, go. Bye! Come in. Please have a seat. Your medical test results are in. You have a… temporary and a permanent disability. You're 7 kg overweight. And your height is 1 cm below the requirement. So we can't select you. You can appeal in two weeks, but I don't want to give you false hope. I've never seen anyone win an appeal for a permanent disability. So… You could have waited a little and eaten with her. She's here. Great! Come, your ice cream is waiting for you. Gunju? What's wrong? What are you doing? Yoga. Go back to sleep. Good morning, Gunju! Good morning, Gunjan. -Good morning, dear. -Papa, please let me sleep. I've brought you something. See what it is. Come on, get up. -Papa, I don't want to. -Come on, take a look. -What is this? -Your future. I don't have one. Come on, just read it. Get up! Up! Read this. Get up. Read. Read. Go on. "Superstar actress Rekha lost 15 kgs in a month." -Sixteen. -Fifteen. Sixteen… Page sixteen. Inside. Read. "Rekha gave up fried food and desserts." Yes. "She drank pumpkin and gourd juice. With exercise and hard work, she got her dream role." Incredible! Here. Papa, I can drink all the juice in the world to lose weight, but how will I become taller? That's the real problem, right? Let's work on what we can control, and leave the rest to God. Those who work hard and never give up in life… are always rewarded with success in the end. Instead of shedding tears, just sweat it out for two weeks. Gunjan… Get up. Get up. How can we do this "Rekha Diet"? Why not? If Ms. Rekha can do it, what's stopping Ms. Gunjan? -Rekha, O Rekha! -Let's go! From the moment I set my eyes on you My destiny's been changing, too I'm in big trouble Rekha, O Rekha! From the moment I set my eyes on you I've gone off the deep end I'm in big trouble Feels like I'm stuck in a nightmare Feels like I'm stuck in a nightmare Day and night You're all that's on my mind You've even robbed my sleep! Rekha, O Rekha! You're taking me down a bumpy road But, girl, you're my only hope! Rekha, O Rekha! Girl, you drive me crazy I have no peace of mind But please, oh please Tell me we're in this together! Rekha, O Rekha! From the moment I set my eyes on you All my dreams are coming true! I think I'm gonna make it Thank you! Rekha, O Rekha! From the moment I set my eyes on you I see myself in you, too I think I'm gonna make it Thank you! Feels like all my dreams are coming true! Feels like all my dreams are coming true! I leave these streets behind Strewing them with my goodbyes I'm finally leaving the world behind So I can fly, fly, fly! My train is leaving the station Full steam ahead it goes I won't be looking back again To the skies, I go! Rekha, O Rekha! From the moment I set my eyes on you I see myself in you, too I think I'm gonna make it Thank you! Feels like all my dreams are coming true! Hmm. Okay. Well, your weight's come down. But… how will you increase your height? Sir, it's just one centimeter. Just one centimeter? The pilot sits here. Sit. Height is directly proportional to reach. Hold this. Sit back. Straight. Hmm… Now hold it. Hmm… Okay. Put your feet on the pedals. Okay. Please get down. Don't worry, darling. You tried your best. Gunjan is below the required height. -Yes. -But… her arm and leg reach is above the requirement by 1.5 centimeters. Colonel… When God selects someone to fly a plane, who are we to reject her? So… congratulations. Your daughter has been selected. Best of luck. Thank you. Papa? -Yes? -I have to talk to you about something. Papa, please come. Okay, come. Yes, tell me. Papa… The Air Force needs pilots who are patriots. Hmm… I just want to fly planes. I'm not being a traitor to the country for my dream, am I? What's the opposite of treachery? Sincerity? If you do your work with sincerity, you cannot be a traitor to the country. You think the Air Force wants people who chant, "All hail Mother India"? No, they want cadets with goals, with passion, who are sincere and work hard at their training. Those are the cadets that make the best officers, who give their country their best. Be a strong, hard-working, and sincere pilot, and you'll automatically be a patriot. Come on. You've spent enough time on the runway, now fasten your seat belt. It's time to take off. Woke me up for such a silly thing. You know, cadets need at least eight hours of sleep. Go to sleep. Come on. The Air Force has only one goal: protecting the nation. For that, you all must become soldiers. That's when you'll be worthy of entering the cockpit. You start your training tomorrow. -Is that clear? -Yes, sir! -Is that clear? -Yes, sir! You gotta fly, fly, fly Don't be scared Don't you worry Grab a piece of ground And just go, go, go You gotta soar, soar, soar Don't you slow down Don't you stop Tell your life you make the rules Take a leap! Touch the moon! Just fly, fly, fly Like a free bird! Just fly, fly, fly Like a free bird Collective, fully down. Cyclic, fully back. Now, level the disc… now, helipad appears. Flare. Cyclic, back. Let your light shine so bright That before your fate is sealed The Lord himself stops and asks… "What is it you want, child?" Burst through those barriers! Don't let your doubts hold you back! -Burst through those barriers! -Proceed with the attack! -Don't let your doubts hold you back! -Tackle! Stab! Remove! Fire! Let go of the old! What's wrong? Sorry, sir. Only bullets work in battle, not your sorries. Go again. The moon is no limit for you You gotta fly, fly, fly Don't you stop, don't give up You were made for the skies Not the earth! You gotta fly, fly, fly Don't you stop, don't you look back! Just follow your heart Take a leap! Touch the moon! Just fly, fly, fly Like a free bird! Just fly, fly, fly Like a free bird! Just fly, fly, fly Just fly, fly, fly Like a free bird! Like a free bird! Let your light shine so bright That before your fate is sealed The Lord himself stops and asks… "What is it you want, child?" Let your light shine so bright That before your fate is sealed The Lord himself stops and asks… "What is it you want, child?" Ma, where's my blue T-shirt? -In the cupboard. -I can't find it. Gunju… here you go. -You're really a pilot, Gunju. -Not a pilot, dada, an Air Force officer. -So you're definitely going? -Of course I'm going, dada. Ma, where have you kept my shoes? They're in your room. Where in the room, Ma? They're not even under the bed. Maybe they're outside, Gunju. Where do you leave my stuff? Gunju, the world Papa's shown you is very different from the real world. Come here. Come. -What is this? -A picture from my passing out parade. What do you see here? I see Air Force officers, dada. Why are you-- How many? Count them. Eleven. Ten. Ten Air Force officers and one girl. That's how the world thinks, Gunju. I can't change the way the world thinks, but I can tell you. Please try and understand. Here we see Shekhar sir not in the mood to lose, but Monty sir is in the mood to defeat him for the third time! The smile on his face says he will succeed, but Shekhar sir won't lose so easily! And Shekhar sir is about to win, but Monty sir… Shekhar sir wins! Monty sir was not good enough today! Hey! What are you doing, man? -What's going on here? -Why are you ruining our life, bro? -Ask the Flight Commander. -Where is he? If you peel your eyes away for a sec, you'll see. Jai Hind, sir! What's… going on? Relax. Get ready, officers. Udhampur is about to see a big change. A change unlike any you have seen before. All dirty talk stops now. Overalls to be zipped up at all times. Harry. The bar shuts at 9:00 p.m. And, yeah… No more posters of women on the walls. Sir… Why are you punishing Ms. Pamela? What's she done wrong? I'll let you know once I've spoken to her. What's this now? This is it. Ms. Change. The first female officer at Udhampur base. Gunjan Saxena. Keys for Pilot Officer Saxena's room, please. Sure, call him. I'm Pilot Officer Saxena. But you're a woman… -Madam! Flight Commander is calling you. -Okay. Keys? Jai Hind, sir! Come in. What an explosive entry. You created quite a storm in the gent's toilet. What medal should you get for this show of courage? Sorry, sir. I didn't want to go to the gent's toilet, but it was an emergency. I searched everywhere but couldn't find a ladies' toilet-- Because there is no ladies' toilet. Why is that, sir? Because this place isn't made for women. Any other questions? -No, sir. -You may go. Sir. -Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind. Jai Hind, sir. Pilot Officer Gunjan Saxena? Sir. Today's your first sortie. See you on the tarmac in 10. -Yes, sir. -Jai Hind. Jai Hind, sir. -Without this-- -Sorry, sir. Jai Hind, sir. Sorry? This is the Air Force, not your house. I'm sorry, sir. Sorry doesn’t change anything. The Commanding Officer was on time, but you were late. -Sir, there's no place for me to change-- -Then change on the tarmac! Stop making excuses. I'm sorry, sir. Again sorry? All your flights are canceled today. Crew room excused. Stay on the tarmac all day! Out! Joker! Once, Viru… Viru, shut up. Sunaina told him-- -No, sir. -Shut up, man. Sunaina said, "No one's home, come over." Then what happened? Viru went and no one was home! He's always teasing you. Well, he's my senior. You're welcome to it, too. Poor Viru! All alone… I'll be right back. Sir… -Sundar. Drink… -Sir, what were you saying in the evening? Yeah, come, let's discuss it. Sir! What's wrong? Sir, can you stop these sorties? I'm terrified. I mean… What if she starts crying in an emergency? What will I handle, her or the chopper? -Gunjan. -Sir! Your sortie is canceled. The captain is not well. Go back. Sir, I was in a boys' school. I've never even spoken to a girl on land. What will I do in the air? Save me, sir. Please. Gunjan. The captain's wife is sick. Your sortie is canceled. Sir, please understand. I don't want to die while training because of a girl. -Sandhu… -Sir, please have it canceled. The chopper's engine is leaking oil. You can take a break today. I've been on a break since I got here, sir. How's training going, love? Everyone's training but me, Papa. Sir, it'll be a problem. Try and understand. Girls can't even drive cars. How will she fly a chopper? So you're also scared? Should I take the controls? No. I can manage. You relax. Jai Hind, sir. Quick, turn or we have to salute her, too. Your sortie is canceled. -But, sir, every day-- -But, what? Hmm? You know tonight's an overnight sortie, right? Do you want to share a room with the male pilots? Or should we build you a special room? The top performing pilot of this quarter is Shekhar. Airborne for 120 hours. He has upgraded his category from C-White to C-Green. From the next quarter, Shekhar will lead formation flying sorties and high-altitude flying briefings. Shekhar, you may sit. Sir! Next in the rankings is Montu. Airborne for 105 hours. Then Harry, 98 hours. And Sandhu, 92 hours. Sir, these are our top pilots this quarter. Last in the ranks is Gunjan. Airborne for 11 hours. -Eleven hours. -Yes, sir. Pilot Officer Gunjan? -Yes, sir? -Were you ill? -No, sir. -Were you on leave? No, sir. Then why aren’t you in the air, Gunjan? Today will decide whether you stay or leave. See me at the tarmac in 10 minutes. We are done, boys. There is no place for bad pilots in the Air Force or in my unit. But, sir, I'm-- If you want to make excuses, you can go home now. No more excuses, please. Sir, I'm not a bad pilot. Right! Let's see. Gunjan! Engine failure! Recover the chopper and go for emergency landing! Collective fully down, speed 60 knots. Select and turn towards the force landing field. Going towards the force landing field, 12 o’clock. That's too easy. Go for 8 o’clock. Go for 8! Fast! Eagle 271 simulating engine failure. Sector West. You fly fairly well. Why are your flying hours so low? Sir… If I tell you, it'll seem like I'm making excuses. Tomorrow onwards, you won't miss a single sortie. You’ll fly with me. Don't celebrate just yet. Why, sir? You'll know tomorrow. What are you staring at? Give me the air-speed reading! Quick! ASI! -100, sir. -100-what, you duffer! 100 knots, sir. -What’s the ground speed? -110, sir. -Lower the collective! -Yes, sir. -Bank to right! -Yes, sir. What about the rudder? -Yes, sorry, sir. -Raise the collective! Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. -Again, sorry! -Sorry, sir. Joker! If you take care of the chopper, the chopper will take care of you. How do we land in a place without a landing spot? We don't land. We hover. -Take control. -Yes, sir. Focus, Gunjan. Hold steady. Maintain position. Focus! Focus. Right. Maintain direction. Focus, Gunjan! Good. Hold steady. Hold steady. Hold steady. ASI. Genny switch. Fuel Shut Off Lever. VSI. Rotor brakes. Altimeter. Casualty evacuation in the Dras sector. I'm sending Shekhar and Sandhu. Instead of Sandhu, send Gunjan. She knows this area better. Nap of the earth flying. Fly close to the ground. Fly at high speed. When the enemy is aiming at the sky… Simple. Stay on the ground, and make him your target. -Got it? -Yes, sir. Gunjan, follow the river. -Take control. -Sir. Focus, Gunjan. Yes. Hold steady. Hold. Hold. Focus. Focus. Right, good. Yeah, too good. Madam approaching. Turn quickly. Could you pass the vegetables? This quarter's top performing pilot is Gunjan. Airborne for 127 hours. She has earned a double promotion to category C-White… and has been cleared for all landings at helipads above 15,000 feet. In the next quarter, Gunjan will lead formation flying sorties, high-altitude flying briefings. Sit down. Next in ranking is Shekhar. 119 hours. Mohit, 102 hours. How's training going, love? -It's not going, Papa, it's soaring. -Soar. Papa, tomorrow's the first time I'll lead a briefing. Wow. Well done, love. All the best. Where's Mohit? -Sir, he's gone to the doctor. -Why? He's injured his knee. -He was crying like a baby. -Look over there. CO sir's indulgence is making "Madam" a "Sir." If it keeps going this way, we'll be taking orders from Madam soon. Take my order for now. Go get some nuggets. Hot and fresh. If they're cold, you'll do your sortie with Madam tomorrow. -Sir… -Don't forget the sauce. -Green? -Red. I was banking a little to the right… Told you. Good morning, everyone. I will be covering the briefing for today's formation flying sortie with the aim of taking off at 0900 hours. We will walk towards the aircraft at 0845 hours and start up by 0855 hours. Gunjan. Stop. Shekhar. Sir! Excuse me. Good morning. The aircrafts allotted for today's formation: Hercules, Zulu 1845, and Zulu 2004. Sir, is there a problem? No. Shekhar, continue. As I was saying, crew composition for Hercules 1 -are Captain Monty, and co-pilot-- -Did I do something wrong? Take your seat. Sit down. -Crew composition-- -Sir, it's my briefing. Why is Shekhar doing it? Don't disturb the briefing, Gunjan. Shekhar, continue! What's your problem with me, sir? My sorties were canceled and now my briefing. -Officer! -I'm just asking, sir. If you have an answer, please tell me. You want an answer? Want to know what the problem is? Shekhar! Come here! Sit down. Sit down! Shekhar… Start! Go. Again. Go. Again. Go. Again! Again! Go. Again! Again. Again. You're weak, Gunjan. There's no place for weakness in Defense. We want people who will shed blood, not tears. An innocent face and big eyes do not change the enemy's mind. You have to fight. Our duty is to protect the country, not to give you equal opportunity. Understand? Remember that the next time you have a question. Shekhar! Continue! She wants answers! Gunjan! What the hell are you doing? Have you gone mad? Yes, I've gone mad. In fact, I've been mad from the start. I'm mad to think that if I work hard and become a good pilot, I can be a part of this unit. It's not just me, my father's mad, too! He always said gender doesn't matter in a cockpit, that men and women are both called pilots. It's a lie! Papa's mad! He didn't know I'd have to arm-wrestle to prove my worth here. I don't want to be a wrestler, sir. I want to fly planes, not carry them. Gunjan. Enough. No, sir, today you listen. I finally understand the problem. The problem isn't my weakness, it's your fear. You are scared that if this "Madam" becomes a "Sir," we'll have to salute her. Right? And that'll be the end of your masculinity. Sir, respecting me will not mean any less respect for you. I promise! Forget it, sir. Congratulations on your narrow-mindedness, your fear, this party, and your hollow male pride. Jai Hind, sir. I won't say another word… To you I'll let my heart break And I still won't say a word I won't say another word… To you I'll let my heart break And I still won't say a word Those bonds we tied together… My love Those bonds are now broken, broken, broken Those bonds are now broken Our ties are broken, broken, broken These bonds are broken These bonds are broken Our ties are broken These bonds are broken Gunju… You can't keep sitting around like this. Go out. Meet your friends. You're attending Mannu's wedding? Come on. I'm… taking this one out. Quickly, get ready and come. Hmm? Gunju, get ready. It's a celebration, it'll be fun. Gunju! Hi! Aunty! Gunju! When did you come? How are you? Are you on leave for my wedding? That's why I left and came home. Same story with me. I went to Mumbai with my makeup kit and my dreams to be a lead actress. For six months, I danced behind the actresses as an extra. Thousands of auditions. Mother, sister, aunt, daughter. I auditioned for them all. But what came of it? I left with a bundle of hope, came back with a truckload of tears. So, I closed the chapter. How long could I keep chasing dreams? But now, I'm starting a new chapter. Maybe I'll find happiness in this one. So what if I couldn't be Madhuri? At least I look like her. Forget about this. Let's dance. I'll play your favorite song. -Come on. -Go ahead, I'll follow. This letter came for you. I'm thinking of quitting the Air Force… and settling down. Settle? Marriage. Mannu looked so happy today. Maybe I should get married, too. Yes, love. You must get married. My clothes are ready. Just tell me when, and I'll be there to give you away. -Why are you saying such things? -No, I'm happy. My daughter wants to give up her career and make parathas. Come, love… let's go make parathas. Come. Come. Come on. Come. These are potatoes. This is flour. Come on. Boil the potatoes. Don't you know how to? How will my daughter manage? Wait, let me show you the spices. This is cumin. This is turmeric. What is this? Don't you know? My daughter hasn't heard of cilantro powder? -I'll show you the asafetida. -Papa, what are you saying? You didn't understand? You're about to do exactly what this world expects from girls. Give up your dreams and settle down. I wanted your mother to… but she did exactly what she's always seen and learned. That's why we never taught you anything that would hamper your progress. What does your brother think? That I don't know… how difficult the world is for women? The solution isn't to shut yourself in a cage, but to break free of the cage and fly. I always had faith… that no one can stop my daughter from flying. But now she's asking me to clip her wings. She wants the ring and the white dress. You wanting to get married… is not just you… but both of us losing. Jai Hind, sir. I'm sorry, sir. -I shouldn't have left like that. -You're going to Kargil. We are at war. The Air Force has been activated. Tomorrow onwards, you'll be operating out of the Srinagar base. The country needs its best pilots right now. Jai Hind. Jai Hind, sir. Papa? I have to go somewhere for a few days. I can't tell you where I'm going. I just wanted to say one thing, Papa. I'll never let you lose. Jai Hind. Jai Hind. -Good morning, sir. -Jai Hind, sir. Good morning, sir. Thank you, sir. -Morning, everyone! -Morning, sir! We already know the enemy has infiltrated through the LOC and entered Kargil. Their location is impossible to tell because of the altitude at which they are hiding. That's why we are here. We have two duties in this war. First: recce sorties. We have to fly over Kargil Valley and identify the locations of the enemy, so our fighter pilots can terminate them. Our second duty: rescue missions. Whenever, wherever we are required, we will have to carry out casualty evacuations. All of you must be ready. -Are you ready? -Yes, sir! -Are you ready? -Yes, sir! -Jai Hind! -Jai Hind, sir! Hello? Twenty-eight years later, we are back at war with Pakistan. This time, the war is being fought above Srinagar in the Kargil Valley, where several Pakistani infiltrators are hiding. The Prime Minister has ensured total vigilance in the security of the nation. The world knows we want peace. Now the world will see our strength in maintaining that peace. The Army has incorporated the help of the Air Force. Gunju? Anshu, as well? Gunju, why can't you understand? This is a bloody war zone. Bullets everywhere, people are dying. One sure shot on your chopper and… -Dada, I'm just doing my duty. -What about Mummy and Papa? I have a sortie, dada. I have to go. Gunju, I'm talking to you. Gunjan! I won't always be there to save you. The war between the two countries is becoming more tense. We are hearing reports from Mushkoh Valley of attacks on the Indian forward post. Many soldiers are feared to be injured. Hawk-2, Hawk-1. Eagle, look out for Pakistani camps and report back to base. Copied, sir. I can see a small enemy camp. Inform base immediately. Flash! Eagle, Hawk-2! Eagle, Hawk-2! Hawk-2, Eagle. Go ahead. Hawk-1, down, Kilo Valley! Coordinates are 345681 and 716373! Descending in the valley to look for pilots! Hawk-2, abort mission and return back to base at once! -But, sir… -Very high risk! I repeat, very high risk! Abort and return! Copied, sir. The first chopper went down in this attack, and both pilots were taken hostage. However, the second chopper managed to escape. This chopper was being flown by a lady pilot. Along with the Army, the enemy has set their sights on the Air Force, as well. The missile attack on the Indian chopper… Anup, are you listening to this? How could you send both your kids out to fight the war? If everyone starts thinking like you, who will protect the country? What if the lady pilot had not evaded the missile? What if the lady pilot was taken prisoner of war? We all know how the enemy treats their prisoners of war, and we don't want a daughter of India to be tortured. Are we running short of men that we need to call upon women? Does Indian Defense want to make the country proud or… The issue of your safety has become national news. Our priority is to protect the country, not you. We don't need the added pressure, Gunjan. You're going back to Udhampur. -But sir-- -Dileep is right. Get ready to leave. Dileep. Yes, sir. I know you're not happy, Gunju, but everyone here is under pressure. Try and understand. What should I understand, dada? All I know is I'm here because of my ability. Shouldn't my ability decide if I can stay? That's how you think, Gunju, not the world. The world won't change how it thinks. Forget the world, dada. Change yourself. Maybe you'll inspire the world to change. I'm going to go. Take care of yourself. Section, take cover! -Fire ahead! Two o'clock! -They're firing from the front! -Take your positions. -Take cover. Biswa, take positions. Sir, we've got you. Get the first aid kit. Wing Commander Singh, there's an emergency evacuation. We have 30 minutes. Prepare your chopper. Over. Pick-up coordinates? Kilo valley. South of Tololing. Closest helipad at GR12344323. Over. Copied. Chopper for CASEVAC will be airborne in seven minutes. It's an emergency CASEVAC. Get two choppers ready. All the pilots are out on their missions. Who's going to go? The battalion is ready to back down, but a soldier is badly injured. -We have 30 minutes to save him. -What's the plan? We'll send two choppers. I'll be in the lead chopper for the CASEVAC. Signal is poor in the valley, so we'll use the follow chopper to communicate with base. -Location of the casualty? -Sir, it's here. Kilo valley. South of Tololing. The area is no longer hostile, sir… -But there's a problem. -Which is? All our pilots are on sorties, far away from the casualty. There's no pilot for the follow chopper. Sir… I have only one option. -Have you seen Gunjan? -She's gone. -Udhampur? -No, she's on a mission. Hawk-2 from 1. Five kilometers from landing zone. Heading northeast. Copied, sir. Hawk-2 from 1. Approaching extraction point. Sir, they're not on the radar anymore. Hawk-2 from 1. Looking for casualty. Confirmed. Hawk-2 from 1. Spotted casualty. -Going for pick-up. -Copied, sir. Go to the ridge at 12 o'clock. Maintain height and continue orbiting till further instructions. Copied, sir. Landing zone clear. Hawk-2 in position behind the ridge. The valley is clear. Going in to land. Will be airborne with casualty in next 01 minute. Hawk-1, enemy movement in the valley. Hawk-1, come in! Hawk-1, come in! Hawk-1, you are in line of fire! Hawk-1, you are in line of fire! Hawk-1, come in! -Hawk-2? Eagle! -Crossing over for visual contact! Hawk-2, come in! Do you read me, Hawk-2? Hawk-2, do you read me? Come in! Hawk-2? Do you read me, Hawk-2? -Hawk-2? -Eagle? Hawk-2! -Go ahead! -Hawk-1 down! Hawk-1 down! Hawk-2, what is your location? Sir, we are behind the ridge. Going in for the pick-up. Hawk-2, retreat! Negative, sir. There are three officers. We can help them. Very high risk! Abort, and return back to base! -Sir, but-- -No, Gunjan! Return back to base at once. It's very risky! You won't be able to do it, Gunjan. You're weak, Gunjan. There's no place for weakness in Defense. I can't change the way the world thinks, but I can tell you. Come in, Hawk-2! Do you read me? The solution isn't to shut yourself in a cage, but to break free of the cage and fly. Come in, Hawk-2! Come in, Hawk-2! Come in, Hawk-2! Do you read me? Sir, I think the signal is lost. -Keep trying. -Yes, sir. Hawk-2? Do you read me? Pick up your gun. Fire! Hawk-2! Do you read me? Do you read me, Hawk-2? Sir, no response. Are they on the radar? No, sir. Keep trying. Yes, sir. Hawk-2! Do you read me? Flash! 7 o'clock! Do you read me, Hawk-2? Sir, it's been 20 minutes. No response. Keep trying. Yes, sir. Hawk-2? Come in, Hawk-2. Come in, Hawk-2. Give me the injections. Gunjan. Again. Ma'am, wait outside, please. Didn't I tell you I won't always be there to save you? But I know that whenever I need it, you'll always save me. Jai Hind, Officer Saxena. Gunjan!
