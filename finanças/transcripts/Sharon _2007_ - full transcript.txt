Citizens of Israel, ﻿the day has come. ﻿We are now beginning a most painful and difficult step, ﻿evacuating our communities from Gaza and northern Samaria. We cannot control Gaza forever. ﻿Over a millions Palestinians live there, ﻿a figure which doubles itself with every generation. ﻿Believe me, the pain this causes me is just as strong ﻿as my clear recognition that it must be done. ﻿This is the father/bf settlements destroying his babies. I don't get it, I've known the man my entire life. ﻿I knew his life long agenda, ﻿and his actions contradict his entire life. ﻿Jews have finally stopped wandering, ﻿they became rooted in their land, you don't throw them out! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿You are not uprooting them and getting something in return, ﻿you're throwing them out for no reason! Why? ﻿You offer no explanation, "Because I say so. ﻿"Now, I say it's beneficial. "﻿I used to say it's a disaster, that we should never do it ﻿"and now? I say we should, so you must pack up and leave." ﻿I asked him: "Is someone threatening you? ﻿"What happened to you, Arik?" He didn't answer. ﻿Hello. ﻿Sharon! Sharon! ﻿Sharon! Sharon! ﻿Arik Sharon was often demonized' as a right-wing extremist. ﻿People forgot this, ﻿Sharon's name was mentioned as a reason to leave the country. ﻿The Americans and the Europeans ﻿didn't see him as a candidate for Prime Minister, just so. Had you told me ﻿a few months prior to his election, ﻿that Sharon would become Prime Minister of Israel, ﻿for your sake, I'd have sent you to a mental institution. ﻿We told him that he stood no chance, Your personality has innate aggression, ﻿you're a warrior, a military man, You personally killed many Arabs in the wars you fought, ﻿you're a scary person. ﻿Your new Defense Minister is amongst the greatest, ﻿most decorated warriors and commanders in Israel's history. ﻿and I'm sure that as Defense Minister, ﻿he shall prove his abilities. ﻿Israel faced the Lebanese problem a few years earlier, with severe terror, ﻿a risk of Arafat seizing power in a neighboring country. ﻿He told everybody, including Menahem Begin, ﻿that the war would last 48 hours ﻿and wouldn't go deeper than 40 km. It wasn't true, ﻿I knew they intended to reach Beirut ﻿and join forces with Christian militias in the Beirut area, ﻿they wanted to strike the PLO with a decisive blow. ﻿Sabra & Shatila, it's the picture of our suffering, ﻿the injustices, the unfairness, ﻿the uprooting, the disposition. ﻿This people had a life one day. ﻿It was Ariel Sharon's allies in Lebanon who did it ﻿Does that alleviate him from responsibility? Who cares? ﻿Had the internatioijal community cared, had Israel cared... ﻿I think he was sacked from his office ﻿and there were more Israelis who went to the streets in protest ﻿of Sabra & Shatila than in any other capital on earth. ﻿He learned what it's like to be out of the consensus, ﻿experienced it firsthand, he and his family. Signs over the country: "Sharon is a murderer", ﻿demonstrations, ﻿and some of his closest friends ﻿calledlhwi a murderer in press interviews. ﻿You can't comprehend it until you've experienced ﻿what it does to a person. ﻿See how I am being attacked, ﻿what haven't they said or written? ﻿They write the most horrible things. ﻿And nobody says a word. ﻿We'were at the farm one evening when suddenly Lily said: ﻿"Arinka, you won't become Prime Minister. ﻿So he said: "How can you say this to me ﻿"when you know how much I want to become Prime Minister? Why?" ﻿She replied: "They hate you so much..." ﻿'they' meant everybody outside their house, ﻿"everybody hates you so much, ﻿"for you to become Prime Minister, ﻿"this country would have to suffer a great catastrophe ﻿"so it's better if you don't become Prime Minister at all." ﻿He called me in America, I was covering Camp David: ﻿"Uri, what's up with this Barak?" ﻿I replied: "Something bad is happening, ﻿"he is willing to give up everything ﻿"including even the Temple Mount. ﻿"He'll give Arafat a foothold on the Temple Mount." ﻿I understood this act of his as a political demonstration against me ﻿meant to show voters that unlike Barak, ﻿who seemed to be willing to give up Temple Mount, ﻿Sharon is more loyal to Israel's sacred places ﻿than the current Prime Minister. ﻿You know we say in Arabic: ﻿"This is the straw that made the camel go down." ﻿I'm not saaying that everything was fine ﻿and because Sharon made the visit ﻿everything collapsed. No, no. ﻿I'm saying it was a compilation of complexities that was built up ﻿and it Game to that critical junction where... ﻿when you cross it, you collapse. ﻿A man like Sharon is summoned in times of distress and despair ﻿and then the savior appears. ﻿If a savior is not needed, Arik Sharon doesn't exist, ﻿just like Churchill ﻿and many other historical figures. ﻿"Ariel, Ariel, Ariel!" ﻿Citizens of Israel, ﻿today you elected me as Prime Minister of Israel. ﻿My government shall strive ﻿to restore the security of our citizens... ﻿Good luck. ﻿As Sharon became Prime Minister ﻿he was expected to use force, act like a bulldozer, but no, ﻿the first goal was a political understanding with the USA. ﻿The Prime Minister.. ﻿How are you? ﻿How are you doing? -Fine, how are you'? ﻿You're looking good. ﻿In battles you have to look good. ﻿and in the first meeting ﻿he presented Bush with a thorough plan, maps included, ﻿showed him how far he'd go and what he was willing to do, ﻿in various scenarios. I think he gained Bush's trust ﻿and showed him extreme scenarios in that first meeting. ﻿First, the country needed to deal with the Intifada, ﻿people may have forgotten, but no one believed it could be stopped. ﻿Buses were exploding, people were killed everywhere, ﻿it seemed out of control. ﻿Tihose were his first months in office. ﻿The security concept in general, and Sharon's in particular, ﻿says, as a rule, that any killer should be eliminated, that's it, ﻿you don't murder Jews, here and abroad, ﻿without paying a heavy price, ﻿even if it takes 20 years. ﻿"Targeted prevention", before Arik became Prime Minister, ﻿was practiced, but sporadically, maybe once a month, ﻿there was no capability of mobilizing all agencies at once ﻿for a task of finding a needle in a haystack. ﻿Arik liked all operations to end with a dead terrorist, ﻿I worked hard to convince him that it's better to catch them. ﻿I didn't succeed, I must say, at the end of the day. ﻿Arik preferred dead terrorists to captured ones. ﻿Hello. ﻿I'm in the fields, watching the wheat grow. ﻿Did the Arabs announce something about a dead Hamas man? ﻿What are they saying? ﻿They lost eight men since yesterday. ﻿Not to the right, here, here. ﻿Over here you will sink. ﻿As soon as the terror stops, ﻿the elimination of terrorists will stop. ﻿You can talk to them on your radio interview, ﻿you can tell them that. ﻿See the cattle? -Yes. ﻿Check out the cattle. ﻿I'll talk to you later. Thank you. ﻿It's important that they announce it. ﻿Look at the beautiful sunset, the bull going for a drink. ﻿There's no doubt that ﻿his parents' attitude towards Arabs ﻿had an impact on him ﻿and there's no doubt that he never forgot ﻿what his mother told him about Arabs. ﻿He always told everyone about it. ﻿He'd quote his mother about the need to always ﻿doubt their true intentions, ﻿he always said that ﻿she kept a firearm under her mattress until she died. ﻿She called him to Cairo during the negotiations with Egypt: ﻿"Don't you believe them!" ﻿Growing up in Kefar-Malal ﻿shaped his character. ﻿A hostile environment Arab villages all around, ﻿and the kid grows up in a place where he must defend himself. ﻿For him it was all a metaphor on one issue, ﻿we've got Zionism, it's an experiment, ﻿to enter a harsh region where we're not wanted ﻿and shall remain unwanted in the foreseeable future and the last stronghold, and the last tree, ﻿and our will to lie down and defend it, ﻿shall determine the fate of Zionism. ﻿Near the Tower of King David's Tomb ﻿the triumphant Israeli Defense Minister, ﻿Moshe Dayan, said: ﻿"We have returned here never to part with Jerusalem. ﻿The Arabs must remember, and understand, ﻿they don't have two options, they only have one: ﻿to reach peace. ﻿They are not capable of defeating us in battle. ﻿To him, like many others, this was almost redemption. ﻿Finally, due to an ﻿Ishmaelite (Arab) mistake, dragging us into war, we conquered the Sinai, ﻿the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, ﻿the Golan Heights. ﻿The best way to capitalize on our victory ﻿is to vastly settle these territories, ﻿to create solid facts, so no one can tell us to return the land. ﻿It's imperative to widen the corridor to Jerusalem, ﻿or to expand Jerusalem. ﻿Usually when we discuss widening an area, ﻿it's clear we mean settling it. ﻿The man visited arid regions, in scorching heat, ﻿not a light footed guy, and he climbed up and down the hills ﻿to personally choose ﻿the exact construction spot. ﻿Settlers of Kefar-Darom, ﻿your decision to settle here, ﻿you contributed greatly, security-wise and politically, ﻿to Israel's future, and I ask... ﻿Can the Gaza Strip be evacuated? ﻿Kurney Shomron Selllemenl ﻿Tell me, Arik, tell me! ﻿They've been shooting at our houses for eight months, ﻿where have you been? Where? ﻿You represent us, do your job! ﻿Put them in jail and start a war. ﻿You know about wars and nothing scares you, ﻿you weren't scared at Sabra & Shatila, ﻿when they told lies about you, you didn’t get upset, ﻿we chose you because we knew'tfiat Arik knows how to fight a war. ﻿I'veiknown jhis since the day# I learned the ABC. ﻿It's true, isn't it? Is it true? -Indeed. ﻿Good, then we want you to start a war! ﻿A painful, extremely brutal event. ﻿It took a very strong man, with almost supernatural powers, ﻿to avoid annihilating Nablus with bombs, really. ﻿"I urge you, Mr. Presided t^'ihe said to Arafat. ﻿"Stop it, stop it. ﻿"Do everything to stop the Intifada, to stop the suicide bombings ﻿"and to restore law and order and the peace process." ﻿That's what his message was. ﻿And what did the President tell him? ﻿" I'll do my best." ﻿Today I experienced a severe shock ﻿and I have seen many difficult sights in my life. ﻿The situation is certainly not simple. ﻿One must look at the broad picture, ﻿this responsibility is mine and I want to tell you ﻿that restrairpt is also an element of power. ﻿Had somebody else said it, a peace activist, "restraint is power", it would come as no surprise, ﻿but when he said it, it was effective and surprising. ﻿Most of the publio wanted retaliation, ﻿he went against the public and took very heavy fire, ﻿like the claims that Peres was running his government. ﻿How are you? ﻿I know you love art, but to find free time in times like these... ﻿We are thrilled, especially now that we present Picasso. ﻿On a personal level, this was a very lonely man. ﻿Surrounded by bodyguards, ﻿The house was empty. ﻿Sometimes he'd even say it. "I am a lonely man." ﻿You could see and sense it every single moment. ﻿That loneliness was killing him. ﻿Lily, who was his partner and friend, ﻿wasn't at his side when he was Prime Minister. It's tough. ﻿Not a day passed without him talking about her, and I felt that her absence was felt daily. He'd always say "She was a special girl," such an expression, "a very special girl." ﻿The fact that she didn’t get to see him as Prime Minister ﻿is heartbreaking. ﻿The pieces are fabulous, indeed, a wonderful collection. ﻿You don't have much time to appreciate art. ﻿I used to have more time. It's a burden, in order to enjoy you need to have time on your own ﻿or to have someone you can share your emotions with. ﻿Today I have neither so it is difficult. ﻿We were at a cabinet meeting, ﻿I was rushed te'Sharon's room, right next to the cabinet, ﻿then I saw the second plane crashing in, ﻿Obviously the old state of affairs was no more. ﻿It wasn't Joschka Fischer alone, ﻿these were the phone calls we were receiving ﻿from all over Europe... ﻿From all over the world. ﻿Why didn't the Intifada stop then? ﻿It was beyond the control of any Palestinian leader. ﻿Maybe Arafat thought that he would look better as a guilty person ﻿than an unable person, ar^d he chose to be the guilty. ﻿I don't know. ﻿Israel started receiving demands ﻿about certain behavior, certain concessions, and he said: ﻿Concessions? Us? ﻿"Muslims attacked gentiles ﻿and we'll make concessions? ﻿"What are these demands? ﻿"We won't allow ﻿"our blood to be a part of any solution ever again." ﻿People were begging him: "Don’t say it. It's not good. ﻿"It will hurt President Bush." ﻿He wrote the speech alone. And he said: ﻿"This is what I'm going to say, this is what I think." ﻿Foreigners, that was the word, do not trust foreigners. I'd say he always felt psychologically threatened, ﻿even in times of relative safety, ﻿you densest on your laurels and never let down your guard. ﻿What's good for the Jews here, what's bad for the Jews there, ﻿that's how he saw the world. ﻿One morning in Italy I mentioned the beautiful landscape, ﻿which-resembled Israel, and he said: ﻿"Don't forget that they exiled us from Israel." ﻿I asked him what he wastalking about ﻿and he was serious. ﻿I said we're meeting with the Italians, not the Romans, ﻿with Berlusconi... ﻿he said: "Don't you forget." ﻿These are pictures my mother, may she rest in peace, ﻿gave to Lily several years ago, right before she passed away. ﻿My grandfather, my grandmother from my father's side, ﻿Grandpa participated in the second Zionist congress, ﻿in Basel. This is me. -You? -Yes. ﻿This is my mother, ﻿all of my mother's family lived very long, ﻿they all died in their nineties. ﻿Here I am, a squad leader, in 1947, ﻿a platoon commander, in the winter of 1948, ﻿my platoon, most of them were killed ﻿in the battles of our War of Independence. ﻿I really like this corner. ﻿You walk in here and you see everybody. ﻿We arrive at the scene, ﻿we're a meter or two away from the bus ﻿and on the bus there are two bodies of 14-15 year-old girls, naked. ﻿Awful. ﻿There are 21 body bags in front of us. ﻿and we walk beside these body bags ﻿and reach the end, where the reporters were gathered ﻿and the Prime Minister said a few words, I don't remember what, but he addressed the United States. ﻿The essence of what he said was: ﻿"You want us to negotiate with these people?" ﻿I wonder what Palestinian state they have in mind. ﻿What Palestinian state? What are they talking about? ﻿The opinion, until that point, ﻿was that all-in all, throughout our wars, ﻿our hard, crazy wars, we had established a state. ﻿Now, for the first time, with these type of blows, ﻿the public was being hit within the borders, women and children, ﻿a sense of helplessness, ﻿That we are unable to protect our citizens. ﻿In 2002 the numbers reached. 450 dead people, ﻿terrible, terrible numbers. ﻿For England or France, proportionally, it equals 9,000, in three years, in American terms ﻿it's close to 50,000. ﻿On Passover eve, while celebrating with my family, ﻿I received the bitter news, ﻿how a celebrating crowd was slaughtered in Netanya. ﻿Awful attack, terrible, from every aspect, ﻿the highest casualty rate, 29 dead, over 100 wounded, ﻿families, in the hotel, on Passover night, ﻿no terror attack was as severe as the one in Park Hotel. ﻿From that day on, a black veil covered Arik's eyes ﻿whenever it came to plans and Palestinian obligations. ﻿At Park Hotel the line was crossed and the inconceivable happened. ﻿If I told you two years earlier that we'd conquer all the Palestinian cities... ﻿that huge bulldozers would crack Arafat's office, room after oom, with him inside and the entire world would support us? ﻿No one would have believed that. ﻿The fruits of this policy were not just the use of force, ﻿but the ability to do so without being stopped. ﻿I am asking you ﻿to ask the whole international world. ﻿All they are keeping silent ﻿about this dirty, ﻿this big criminal. ﻿It seemed Arafat would never die When he had medical checkups, ﻿we obtained his files, and his results indicated ﻿that he had no intentions of dying soon. People told Arik: ﻿"Kon't kill him, he will die eventually ﻿"but not in the next 30 years." it drove him mad. ﻿I was told by the Americans that Bush, ﻿from his first meeting with Sharon, ﻿asked him not to kill Arafat, and he got his commitment ﻿not to kill Arafat. ﻿And Sharon later, he said it publicly in one of those meetings ﻿that some people conveyed to me ﻿that he regretted that he made that promise to President Bush. ﻿The open line to the White House ﻿was something unprecedented in Israel's history, ﻿in a sense of cooperative thinking during the action. ﻿President Bush told him: ﻿"If you agree to compromise, I agree to make demands, ﻿"demands that no other president agreed to make ﻿"and I'll stand by you." ﻿wants to give the Palestinians sometfiing no one has ever given them before. ﻿A chance to found a state. ﻿Not the Turks, not the British, not the Egyptians.nor the Jordanians gave them such a chance. ﻿Good evening. ﻿The results from the polls: A substantial Likud victory, ﻿the left has taken a beating... ﻿36 seats for the Likud. ﻿The Labor Party has 18 seats. ﻿For the first time, the Likud defeats Labor completely, ﻿Ariel Sharon has a national, narrow, right wing government ﻿with over 70 seats. The people have spoken clearly. ﻿When I entered the Knesset for the first time, ﻿after returning from the Yom-Kippur War, ﻿after spending a few months in Egypt... ﻿entered the Knesset ﻿and it was a serious crisis for me... ﻿It was a real crisis. ﻿Switching from the military to politics? ﻿It's not the fact that you no longer have this power. . let﻿'s call it authority. ﻿I never had authority, I never acted that way. ﻿The fact that you've witnessed the most horrible sights, ﻿made the hardest decisions, ﻿life or death decisions for yourself and for others, ﻿and then you meet people ﻿who never had to make a serious decision! ﻿No serious decisions. ﻿No life or death decisions, ﻿people who don't know the thrill of victory ﻿or the agony of defeat. ﻿And these people are just as influential as yourself. ﻿It's not a discussion about democracy, just a feeling. ﻿The road map was inaugurated with much hope, in Aqaba, ﻿in the presence of Bush, Sharon, King Abdullah and Mahmoud Abbas. Prime Minister Abbas now leads the Palestinian cabinet. ﻿Unfortunately, the high hopes ﻿were not fulfilled. ﻿Arafat was still the Chairman, he didn't want any process, ﻿surely he wanted Abbas to fail as Prime Minister. ﻿Hamas carried out those two horrific attacks in Jerusalem. We felt the road map ﻿was a great achievement, but that the whole thing could fall apart ﻿because there was no one to talk to on the other side. ﻿We received a message ﻿that the U.S. won't be able do defend such a reality, ﻿where the Palestinians do nothing to prevent terror ﻿and the process is stuck. ﻿They said the world would turn to them and say ﻿that the read map is a fine idea, a fine formula, ﻿alas, it isn’t working. ﻿And when a formula does not change reality, ﻿you don't dump reality, you check the formula. ﻿Arik felt he was reaching a point in time ﻿where if he didn't act, ﻿others would, ﻿forcig him to chase them instead of lead them. ﻿I remember sitting at his home one day, he and I, ﻿after the meal, in the kitchen, and he says to me: ﻿"I think there will be no choice... ﻿it slipped into our conversation, ﻿"but to leave Gaza." ﻿It was the first time ever since I met Arik ﻿that I saw tears in his eyes, during that conversation. ﻿Watery eyes. And Arik is really not the type. ﻿He explained this step must be taken, ﻿for without it we face stagnation ﻿and when you do nothing in the Middle East, in our region, ﻿time works against you. ﻿Our generation's biggest task, I think, as a Prime Minister, ﻿is to maintain a Jewish majority. We had 8000 citizens over there and more than a million Arabs, ﻿and it couldn't last. ﻿I think he never took us as partners. ﻿He never believed it. He never believed, ﻿deep inside his heart, ﻿that we could be partners. ﻿As Prime Minister, I shall plan and carry out ﻿moves that will shape Israel's image in the upcoming years. ﻿You can't be Prime Minister ﻿unless you consider everything in two dimensions. ﻿The current dimension, when you act, ﻿and the historical dimension, where you will be judged. ﻿I want to take this opportunity to address the Palestinians ﻿and repeat what I said in Aqaba: ﻿We do not want to govern you, ﻿we want you to run your own lives ﻿in a state of your own. ﻿But if in a few months' time ﻿If the Palestinians keep ignoring their role in the road map, ﻿Israel shall initiate a unilateral security move ﻿of disengagement from the Palestinians. ﻿Unilateralism cancels negotiations ﻿and replaces negotiations with dictation. That's the concept. ﻿The concept of unilateralism is the real exposition ﻿of Sharon’s political philosophy as far as we are concerned. ﻿I'm convinced that with our united faith, ﻿we can succeed in any direction we choose. ﻿Thank you and Happy Hanukkah. ﻿he didn't sirrmply turn a page in his life's book. ﻿he sat in his office, I walked in and he said: ﻿"You know, last night I had an awful dream," ﻿this was 5 days before the disengagement. "I dreamed about climbing down into a well hanging on a rope ﻿"and the rope snapped." ﻿This is the father of settlements destroying his babies. ﻿And I have always said that the Israelis must choose, one day, ﻿between settlements or peace. They cannot have both. ﻿I want to ask everyone not to assault... ﻿the soldiers and policemen. Do not blame them, don't make it hard on them. ﻿Hurt me, I'm responsible, hurt me, blame me. ﻿The seams Arik broke here ﻿really shook the foundation. ﻿There is no disengagement, never happened, never will! ﻿Lies, lies, lies! ﻿To think this was possible, that it may continue, ﻿that everything we built over a generation ﻿could be demolished, if it is uprooted, ﻿it may continue all over Israel, you feel that Zionism may be reversible. ﻿Arik's thinking was: ﻿We paid dearly, ﻿but in return we got an entity with defined borders, ﻿with responsibility, ﻿with clear guidelines on how a state should behave, ﻿respecting borders and human life, and so on, ﻿and we reserved the right to act if it proved otherwise. This week, the last Israeli soldier left the Gaza Strip ﻿and the military rule in that region is no more. We were walking, and hundreds of U.N. officials came out, ﻿of all colors, and started applauding. ﻿To think it went from one extreme, of an outcast, ﻿to the other extreme of being revered. ﻿He was revered, they stood up, there was genuine excitement, ﻿the U N. stirred. ﻿When we discussed the next step we came up with an idea ﻿to evaluate the West Bank, to the major settlement blocks, ﻿a process that would leave the Jews west of the fence ﻿and the Palestinians east of the fence. ﻿Maybe if all had gone the way we hoped, in four to six years ﻿it would have left us with a totally different reality. Have any of you been to Mongolia? I have. -Yes? ﻿I crossed Mongolia on a motorcycle. ﻿For such things I envy you, ﻿but I have a problem, for some reason ﻿my motorcycle license wasn't renewed. ﻿I haven't finished my appeal on that matter. ﻿These are the things I love. ﻿The problem is that today, with this... ﻿I'm no longer on my own, ﻿in order to have fun you need a small group, ﻿people with mutual interests. ﻿I want to tour parts of the world I've never visited. ﻿I hope I can arrange it soon. ﻿I want to see more landscapes and wildlife than people. ﻿I'd gladly do it in the company of the few people ﻿who enjoy the same things. ﻿That evening, I called, and one girl from the office said something was wrong. ﻿That's it. ﻿Between the first and second stroke, ﻿he was very sad, reserved... ﻿and one day he suddenly said to me: "You know, this caught me at the wrong time." ﻿When the first doctor came out from the operation room, ﻿I realized that... ﻿a chapter had ended. ﻿I think it's very tragic ﻿and to me it's like a story of a chapter of a Greek tragedy. ﻿Suddenly, one day, you're in a different place, everything is different, the country is different. ﻿Kefar-Malal is a small place, ﻿but I have traveled the world, met with heads of states, ﻿and I told them all where I was born and raised. ﻿My conclusion is that our generation, ﻿we who saw our country when it was small, ﻿who saw the struggles, the events, the terrorism, the wars, ﻿I thought our generation should also try and find a solution. ﻿This is what led to my decision ﻿to try and make a profound change. ﻿It is very Ipard, it is very painful, ﻿it isn't simple... ﻿but at least let us know, our generation and the others, ﻿that we put in an honest effort. ﻿"Ariel Sharon, Prime Minister"
