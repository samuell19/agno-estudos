[English subtitles are available] [In 2077, gene technology advanced by leaps and bounds. There is a mysterious organization in the world, which specially organizes an underground competition: tomorrow's war, for the rich. Around the world, there are huge consortia that privately invest in gene mutation,] [which creates mutant soldiers with super ability to participate in the competition and divide the interests according to the team score ranking. For a time, mutant people spread] [all over the world like drugs, and mutant crime became more and more serious. In order to combat mutant crime, the relevant governments jointly established the special action team of the International Security Alliance.] This is the best of times and the worst of times. [Underground laboratory Korea-Medusa consortium] Gene technology revolutionizes the times. The 166th genetic induction injection experiment is ready. Medusa, South Korea's mysterious crime organization has a delusion of changing the world. That's why they created gods to conduct illegal human genes experiments with human lives. As an agent of International Security Alliance Organization, I was ordered to sneak into Medusa to collect criminal evidence. However, an accident happened during the operation. I was injected with gene induction solution. Injection procedure started. Transplant immediately. Experimental subject No. 166, Wu Qingqing has been injected with genetic induction solution. All data are stable. There is no sign of genetic fusion at the moment. It remains to be seen. Other experiment subjects will be sent to the headquarters for evaluation. [Warning] Report the situation. Boss, we're late. Ghost has been injected with gene induction solution. The situation is unknown. But the rescue operation went well. I'll evacuate as soon as I get the data chip. Data chip for the experiment is very important. You must bring it back. Roger. Experimental subject No. 137 is disconnected. The chip is withdrawn. Ghost! Ghost! Ghost! Ghost! Can you still move? What about the experimental data? Warning. The experiment chamber was destroyed. The experiment subject was kidnapped. Retreat! Be careful. Catch it. Are you okay? I'm fine. Retreat. Follow me closely. Let's go. Mutant is injured. The experimental subject escaped from the chamber. The defector is from Engineering Information Department, whose name is Wang Changyun. It's been a long time since I played a game of catching rats. Let's go. The exit is ahead. Sweethearts. Where do you want to go? Sleep. If you fall asleep, you can go home. Tell me. Who sent you here? What's your purpose? Can you tell me all of your secrets? Go away. Fatty, wake up. Fatty. Are you okay? Take the chip back to the headquarters. Finish the mission. Keep the data in the chip. Let's go. [Mutant] [Ghost War Girl] [2077 in Korea] [Medusa Building] [Medusa Building Li Yongshun] Li Yongshun. Don't be cocky for too long. Medusa's crime of secretly conducting illegal human experiments will be revealed soon. Bastard. You're wasting my time. As you ordered, experimental subject No. 165, Choi Yu-hee, is receiving a test at the gladiatorial arena. Whether to connect to the site? Arena live. Over. Connecting to the gladiatorial arena. Why are you doing this to me? Congratulations. Experimental subject Choi Yu-hee's power has awakened. She has become a Class A mutant. This is the evolution of mankind. It's a blessing from God. Who are you? Where are you from? Which organization are you from? Li Yongshun. Are you scared? I came out of your grandma's womb. I'm elder than you anyway. You should call me daddy. Hello. Medusa. Please give your order. Chase the experimental subject. Get the chip back. Over. Wu Qingqing. Hello, don't be nervous. What's your name? Do you remember what happened to you? Name. Don't trust anyone. What happened? Are you okay? Where are you going? What's your name? My name is Zhou Yang. You're in danger, you know? You have to go back with me. Don't wander around. Look. Look how dangerous it is. You're in danger now. Why are you... Why are you spinning? Are you okay? Do you need some medicine? Enough! Jun. Jun. Thank you, Miss. Let's go. Targeted the experimental subject, Wu Qingqing. Arrest her. Who are you? Why are you arresting me? We have to get out of here. Come with me. Who are you? Special agent of Special Case Investigation Team. Zhou Yang. Interrogate the defectors. Chase the experimental subject. I don't think they are your business. Is this person important to you? No. Is the thing important to you? Not really. But I'm unhappy. If it doesn't matter, why are you unhappy? I'm in charge of the mutants here. And you're only responsible for collecting funds. Don't do what you're not good at. This isn't fun at all. Medusa. Please give your order. Help me analyze the experimental data. Gene fusion rate of Wu Qingqing is 20%. She has the quality of a Class B mutant. Then let's send Class A mutant Cui Youxi to kill Wu Qingqing and retrieve the chip. Emergency news. At 2 a.m. on October 4, The plastic surgery director Catherine was killed. Contact the police if you have any clues. Chinese martial arts can't be mastered overnight. Judging from all your subconscious reactions, you must have received strict or even cruel training as an agent. Tell me. Why did you sneak into South Korea? If I knew why I came to South Korea, I wouldn't be talking to you here. A loser like you are not qualified to negotiate with me. Okay. Let's stop the boring test. Who are you? We'll know soon. You've been busy all night. Can you do it or not? How can you know it within one night? Don't underestimate me. You think I am playing games with all this gear? I seem to have seen these girls before. You're not among them. Although these missing girls have different backgrounds, but the missing areas are all near Incheon. The local security cameras were destroyed. I was just trying to confirm my prediction. I ran into you who just crawled out of the sewer. At first, I thought you were a victim. But now, you could be a butcher. Before the other police arrive, I must ensure your safety. I was going to find out the truth from you. The official program protected your identity. So I want to hack into the surveillance system that can recognize your face. Boss. Can I borrow a scanner? Stand still. When can my memory be restored? When an agent is faced with an urgent situation, their deep memory will turn on the alert to protect the information of the organization and mission from disclosure. So your memory loss is only temporary. As for how long you'll recover, it's up to you. [Name Cui Youxi Gender Female] [Age unknown Room 702] [Address unknown Height 167 cm] [Name Wu Qingqing Gender Female] [Age unknown Room 703] [Address unknown Height 170 cm] It seems that Wu Qingqing is just my identity. Any other things or clues? In my consciousness, it is more important than my life. This chip is very advanced. It's a bit troublesome to operate. The chip system must be independently developed. It's highly encrypted. We need more advanced equipment or the real system to open it. Aim! Put it in! Who is it? Police. Please cooperate with the investigation. Hello. Hello. There's been an assault in the neighborhood. Did you see this suspect? I didn't see her. I've been home all day today. I see. Is there anyone else in the house? No, absolutely not. -Honey, come on, do you want to continue or not? -What? I'll close the door. -Just now... -Just now... -You... -I... Watch out! What happened? Sister. We meet again. Cui Youxi in the video. Cui Youxi. Since You're fine now, why didn't you call your family? Family? Dad. Mom. Warning. Defectors will be executed. Class A mutant, Cui Youxi. Continue your mission. I have no time to waste. Hand over the experiment's data chip. I won't give it to you. You really are just a Class B. Poor weakling. Mr. Wang. As you can see, as long as we have enough money, we can develop stronger mutants. With them participating in tomorrow's war, your company will have a bright future. But I'm a businessman. I believe in investment and return ratio. Mr. Li asked me to reinvest three billion RMB to exchange for several Class A mutants to participate in tomorrow's war. What's the use? We both know the threshold of tomorrow's war is Class S! Mr. Wang Gang. Science can't reach the sky in one step. It takes time. I won't take the risk. Three billion RMB can hire three mutants above Class S to participate in tomorrow's war. I won't waste my time with the garbage in your hands. As far as I know, the experimental subjects of yours haven't signed experiment treaties. Goodbye. The sale did not work but the benevolence is still there. Do you want to break up with me? No one dares to call my mutants garbage. Chip! Chip! Stop! Is this the chip you mentioned? Chip! Chip! You've been beaten like this. You're still thinking of the chip? Sister. You and I are experimental subjects of gene induction solution. We're in the gene activation period. Only if we continue injecting gene induction solution can we live. You can't give the chip to her. Sister. I didn't mean to kill you. Many people like me were controlled by Medusa. Youxi. I want to go home. Cui Youxi leaked information. Terminal Angela has started the destruction process. Wake up! Gene induction solution. Hello. Medusa. Please give your order. Send the invitation. In three days, tomorrow's war... Some people are not only nosy, but also ruin their own business. What a joke. Angela. You have no other cards besides Cui Youxi. It seems you don't know my new toy. Poor Mr. Wang. If a few minutes earlier, you'll be business partners. Who allowed you to touch my stuff? Yours or the organization's? Don't forget who has control over the mutants. Who cares if a defector dies? The most important thing now is Wu Qingqing. By the way, I forgot to tell you. I've uploaded the video about your negotiation with Wang Gang. After all, I don't like dogs that hold me back. Mr. L is calling. Angela. You didn't let me down. Wu Qingqing's performance was unexpected. Get the chip and capture her alive. We do everything for tomorrow's war. We will rule time and death as mortal beings. What about you? How's the fund preparation going? I've contacted all rich merchants in the world. In three days, the funds will be ready. Stop doing stupid things. I'm not asking you to entertain yourself. We will rule time and death as mortal beings. In three days, if Wu Qingqing does not show up, then... This... This medicine is new. I don't know the effect. It's fine now. [Aunt Mei's Chinese Medical Center] Where is the chip? I have the chip. Aunt Mei. She is okay looking like this, right? Of course not. It's a miracle that I'm alive. This is a sample from someone else. I heard that it's in shortage recently. For this medicine, they can do anything illegal. Buddha bless us. Little girl. Little girl. Are you feeling better now? Much better. Thank you, Aunt Mei. You're not young anymore. When will you bring me a girl? He always causes me a lot of trouble. He never put me at ease. This girl... Little rascal, come here. Come and burn incense with me. Here. You little rascal. Hurry up and pack up. You're so sloppy. She's a nice girl. It'll be a loss if you miss her. Do you understand? You are not young anymore. Do you understand? You need enough gene induction solution to get through the activation period. The gene induction solution in Aunt Mei's hand is from Le Tian Bar. It's a complicated place that no party bothers to govern. Keep a low profile when you enter the bar. Remember to suppress your gene fusion rate. Find the gene induction solution first and get information. Don't make any trouble. Miss. What are you looking for? I want to see your boss. Miss. I'm in charge here. Just tell me if you need anything. Hello? Boss. Someone is looking for you. 3% genetic fusion rate. What do you want from me? I heard you have gene induction solution here. Where did you come from? Who sent you here? I escaped from Medusa. They injected me with the gene induction solution. You haven't passed the gene activation period yet. If you give me the gene induction solution, I can do anything for you. As long as I'm willing to... They... They... They can give me the whole world. You're a defective defector. How dare you bargain with me? Of course. Everyone here is defective. Well, I can give you a little of the gene induction solution. But you have to help me. After all, the 3% genetic fusion rate is extremely rare. You won't send me back to Medusa, right? Catherine died at the perfect time. After she was killed, the supply was cut off. We don't need her help anymore. The director of the plastic surgery hospital Catherine was killed. So, at present, I just need you. Smile. Medusa now offers a reward for the capture of Class A mutant Wu Qingqing with the gene induction solution. I might let you down. I told you to keep a low profile, didn't I? What happened to you? Don't just stand there. Let's go. Aunt Mei. It should be enough after this one, right？ This is not something good. All right. Little girl, you have successfully passed the gene activation period. Understand? Thank you, Aunt Mei. You're welcome. It's fine. Don't worry. Aunt Mei, I dragged you down this time. You may need to hide somewhere outside. No problem. I'm used to it. But it'll be too late if I don't leave now. May everyone be safe. Goodbye. What should we do next? We'll go to Medusa Hospital to find out the truth. [Medusa Plastic Surgery Hospital] Let's enter. Wu Qingqing. You'll be the next. Don't trust anyone. Immediately initiate the Genetic Modification Project of Medusa. Let's go. The exit is right ahead. The 166th subject of gene induction solution is ready to carry out. It rings a bell to me. Ghost. Ghost. Wu Qingqing. Ghost. Wu Qingqing. Ghost. Ghost. Wang Changyun, an intelligence agent, has found out that Medusa Plastic Surgery Hospital has been conducting a secret experiment of the gene induction solution. There are also a series of abductions and human experimentation. In order to obtain more evidence, the organization will send you to infiltrate Medusa Plastic Surgery Hospital and cooperate with the investigation. You must collect relevant evidence. Yes, I accept the mission. Your new identity is Wu Qingqing. I'm a member of the International Security Alliance Organization. Ghost. Boss. It's been three days. Wang Changyun and Ghost haven't come to contact. I think we should plan for the worst. Connect the plastic surgery hospital system. We're connecting you to the Medusa Plastic Surgery Hospital System. Hi, Wu Qingqing. I'm Angela, the administrator of Medusa. I heard that the afternoon tea in Chinatown is better than the one in the police station. What are you going to do? In half an hour, bring Wu Qingqing and the data chip of the lab to Chinatown. Otherwise, you know, destroying Chinatown for me is a piece of cake. Zhou Yang, I like obedient kids. What should we do now? What do you mean? I mean the following mission. Of course giving the gene induction solution and Medusa's incriminating evidence to the International Security Alliance Organization, and let them handle this. Miss, didn't you hear what that crazy little girl said? I mean the people in Chinatown. What about them? Mission is the important thing. And my mission is to ensure the safety of the evidence. The lives of others is not within my duty. So you mean your mission is more important than people's lives? If we go to Chinatown now, we'll definitely be killed. We'll also lose the last chance to eliminate Medusa. Don't you know what's more important? Fine. My fault. Since you have regained your memory, let's disband our group here. I'm going to save my family, friends, and neighbors. Be your hero and save the world. I' m Ghost of the special action team. I'm here to report my mission. This is the evidence and videos of Medusa's crimes. Your mission is accomplished. You can go back to the headquarters. Boss. Wang Changyun sacrificed himself to complete the mission. Don't you have anything else to say? Losing Wang Changyun alone is not the worst thing. Instead, if you and Wang Changyun both died, the organization would not only miss the chance to collect evidence, we would also send more members to risk their lives to complete this mission. Otherwise, the Medusa Group will keep expanding and developing, with more people harmed. Do you think Wang Changyun's sacrifice is worth it? Boss, If you have to make a choice, how do you know what you chose is right? So you came here alone? I thought you would come alone too. I'll take the responsibility. I saved Wu Qingqing. The crime data was also solved with my help. We have clear division of work. I'm in charge of saving people. She is the one who stabilized the overall situation and carried the banner. Isn't it better if we can work together? What about your sense of perspective? In the past, I lived for the mission. But now, I'm doing this for the people who need me at this moment. Think carefully. It's not too late if you regret now. I guess you're the one who regrets it now. Let's make it quick. Be careful. Ladies and gentlemen, as you all know, Angela is our S-class mutant. She's a blessing from God. But humans have endless pursuit of perfection. New specimens can compete with them. She is the daughter of God. With her, you can win the championship in the tomorrow's war. Show time! It's on live now. There are three bears living together. Daddy bear. Mommy bear. Baby bear. Zhou Yang! No matter how fast your sword is, it can't beat my speed of healing. Warning! The mutant administrator Angela died. The test subject Wu Qingqing's genetic fusion rate exceeded 40%. Her combat power index reaches Class S. Mr. Li, The growth speed of new specimen of Medusa is indeed amazing. But she seems not under your control. I think we won't trade with you until the Medusa's technology is mature enough. As long as we raise the funds and improve the technology, can we guarantee your interests. This is kidnapping and blackmailing. Don't be afraid. Let's continue the deal! Zhou Yang, You can't die here. Looks like I can't get today's best record. How do I look? I wasn't scared, was I? You're so handsome today. Zhou Yang. I may not have the chance to watch a movie with you. Zhou Yang. Zhou Yang! Zhou Yang! Zhou Yang. Subject No. 166, Wu Qingqing, based on your excellent performance, Medusa Organization now invites you to join us. Administrator Li Yongshun will be waiting for you at the Medusa Building. Li Yongshun. Stop it. It's all over. Wu Qingqing, You and I are both perfect humans. We can create a new world together. What do you think a new world is like? Do you mean sacrificing more innocent people? You don't understand my faith at all. I did all this for their own good. I don't need to understand. I will never understand. I will only choose what I think is right. You disappointed me. You're staining this place. You don't deserve to join Medusa. I don't belong here. You're not perfect. Let me send you to the God's world. What's this? Soju and fried chicken. You saved my life. I should express my gratitude to you. Let's keep helping and trusting each other. We've been through so much together. Now, are we legitimate and good men? No way. If I were a rebel of Medusa, you might not even be able to be a civil servant anymore. That's impossible. I believe in my instinct. Come on. What are you doing? Relax. Imagine that you were in Seoul right now, eating fried chicken, and drinking soju. There is light rain outside. Raindrops are making the tick-tock, tick-tock sound. You are now an ordinary, a very ordinary girl. Relax. Don't stress yourself out. Aunt Mei said tidy girls are the prettiest. Since I was young, you're the first person to tie my hair. When everything is over, I'll treat you to a movie, okay? And then? I may not have the chance to watch a movie with you. I'm Zhou Yang, a special agent of the Special Case Investigation Team. October 8, 2077, 17:15, the Korean police and the International Security Alliance Organization conducted raid of Medusa criminal organization led by Li Yongshun. A large amount of illegal gene induction solution and a list of experimental subjects who were abducted illegally were found. Its crime is extremely serious. A full-scale arrest has been launched. I thought I would never see you again. I have to come back to watch a movie with you. This is both the worst era and the best one. Gene science and technology is challenging the social ethics. It also pushed the era to move forward revolutionarily. All my past experience, dark or light, are engraved on my body and memory. I, Ghost, as an agent of the International Security Alliance Organization, will still keep on carrying the burden and pursuing justice. Because those marks let me know that genes are changing us. We are also changing the genes. Let's grow towards the sun and always follow the light. We will eventually get the best era ever. Ghose from the special action team of International Security Alliance Organization is now requesting an action.
