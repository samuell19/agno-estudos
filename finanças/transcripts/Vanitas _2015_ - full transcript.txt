Research shows that a high percentage of art in museums is fake. 40% were phonies or so hypocritically restored... That they were the same as forgeries. Vanity of vanities; all is vanity. Thank you Lucien, "merci"! I mean, "Professor Aerts". For the students among us... Professor Aerts. Decay... is insurmountable for everything on this planet. How long... can we look our friend Rembrandt in the eye? And for how long will he be looking back at us... with the same sparkle in his eyes that was given to him the moment... the master's pencil touched the canvas? Immortality of beauty is illusive. Antwerp. I don't understand why Sarah... just came home from Paris all of a sudden. I called Alex. Don't tell Sarah. I promised her I wouldn't. The funny thing is, he was acting strange as well. What do you mean? - He acted aloof That's not like him. It's like something bad happened in Paris that they're keeping from me. You should ask Sarah. Three months earlier. Paris. So according to Sarah the colors are darker. We're looking into it, but we're not sure. Cyril, help me get the painting off the easel. There's this story of a painter who was doing a landscape... and the sun was so bright... The sun was so bright that he had to put on his sunglasses. When he finished his painting, he found it hideous... and threw it away. Misled by the light. True story! No, the color's perfect! But Sarah is right being so perfectionistic. This painting will soon be in an exposition at the Musée d'Orsay. And don't forget that it's worth roughly a million. Yes. Yes, I see. Ok, that's fine. Thank you Michel, have a good night. Sorry, what were we saying? Oh yeah, Eva, what do you think of her? She's nice, and she's good at her job, right? - I agree, she's very precise. - You wanted to tell me something? Sarah, you should try and see me and everyone else as... extras in the movie of your life. What do you mean by "extras"? Well, I'm just a passerby... a character on Sarah's canvas. For Sarah, everything exists because of what she observes. Without Sarah there's no Alex, and no... what's your ex's name again? - Thomas. Alex and Thomas are your creations, you're the one directing. O.K. Without Sarah there's no Alex, Thomas or Cyril. Cyril? Honestly, Sarah. You really think that if you weren't here, all those people would exist? I'm going to have to think about that. „Est-ce que sans moi tu resteras ? Dis-moi pourquoi j'existerais ?" You know that song? - Yes, that's Jean Bastin. - Bravo, indeed. It's from before you were born. I'm joking. To my little Sarah. Kiss me. Later, I'm tired. - Is this someone you know? Someone you admire? - No, just someone I met. - A musician? - And you're interested in their way of life? That's not actually the subject of this painting. - It's beautiful! - Thanks. You're here without Alex? Yes, but he's coming, right? I don't know, I didn't invite him. Look at that painting over there, how warm those colors are. I felt like painting a still life... - Sarah, have you seen Alex? - No. We're all having diner at Le Chat Noir tonight. So if you see him... And don't forget the alarm. - What? - Activate the alarm when you leave. Alex? Alex? Alex? And did you see those replicas? Did you tell your father? No, I get it. Yes. Sarah, I always told you the art world is rotten. What was this Alex's name again? No. O.K. Sure. Bye. Arnaud? Is that job in Ghent still available? I know I said I'm in Paris... but things have changed. - Yes, that's cheese. - I love the way you say that. - Cheese. - Alex? Will you be restoring that vandalized painting? If it's even possible to do that... I don't know, that's still being negotiated. But of course I know it better than anyone. - Hey Sarah, are you ok? Bad day? - No, she's not not having a bad day. She looks like a Madonna from a painting. Actually, I decided to accept a job in Belgium, in Ghent. Come on Sarah, don't do that! Sarah, what's all this bullshit about returning to Belgium? I thought you and I had plans together. I've looked everywhere for these, I thought I'd lost them. Thank you. Sit down, Sarah. I owe you an explanation. An explanation... You have to believe me, I was going to show you that studio. I absolutely wanted to show you. But not like this... Sarah, what are you going to do in Belgium? Stay here, with us! You'll see it'll be worth your while. Why... Why don't you paint your nails like Christine, that would be so cute! Blue, black, blue... Has anyone else seen those paintings? I'm such an ass to lose those keys, those originals are worth a fortune. You don't know half the story, Sarah. Of course I didn't tell you about The Friends of the Masters. You know what that is? It's a huge international project. I was going to explain it to you. - I'm leaving. - No Sarah, stay. - Alex, you're drunk. - Who cares! Give me a hug. It's wrapped heavily! It's gorgeous! Thank you! When you shake it, it snows in Paris. Sarah, I've been thinking about those replicas... Valerie, not now... Replicas? What are you talking about? - It's nothing Sophie. - I just meant... It's all got to do with Alex, and... Well, we had a thing together... Alright. - So, busy day? - Yes, kind of. Everyone's already seen you... ...before you're visiting your father. - I know, I'm sorry. You look different. Come on dad, after six months? - So, what have you been up to? - A piece from a private collection. Look at this, a typical example of... ...irreparable degradation. - See? - Yes. What do you think it is? Smalt blue. Well done, girl. Yes, the degradation is really severe. So you'll be starting in Ghent soon? Yes, with Arnaud. And for that you quit your internship in Paris? You understand I'm a bit surprised, right? I arranged that internship for you. Alex and I are close friends, I mean... if there's a problem... you can tell me. Did you and Alex get along? And his wife? That green over there... isn't there a... coppery shine below it? Good afternoon. - I called you about Alex Abadie's book. - Ah yes, you're from Antwerp. I’ll get it for you. Thanks. Here it is. - I been looking for this for a while. - Really? Well, it is pretty rare. Ghent Tomorrow we'll visit the site. When the scaffolding is built, we can finally start. When the scaffolding is built, we can finally start. I've discussed the building of the scaffolding with the other company. Everything looks great. What other company? You don't think we'll be able to finish this job by ourselves do you? They are specialized in doubling, we'll split the work. Yes, I get that but... I'm just asking who they are. The important thing is that we'll be able to come up with a plan tomorrow. When we're on the scaffolding we'll be able to refine our research-report. That's all there is to it. Yes, but who is this other company? It's the company of Victor Van der Veken. You're joking... Dear people... I would like to... warn you. Since you are preparing to step into the real world soon... to submerge yourselves in the wealth... of what this artistic trade... has to offer. But... we're in the middle of a crisis. A huge crisis. You might not notice this in the faces of your professors, or at work. But I'm telling you... We're in the middle of a war! Oh, I almost forgot... I brought you something. To make it up to you. Make up? What did you do wrong then? Let's have a look. 2009. A great year for the South of France. Have you started working in Ghent yet? Tomorrow we're transporting the paintings to the other company. Which company? You know which company? I really hope you're sure of what you're doing, Sarah. So ehm... how's Sophie doing? - Last time I saw her, she was... - Sarah, we have to talk about this. I didn't send you to Paris for nothing. I had my reasons, you might want to go back after Ghent. I have a present for you as well. Where did I put it... Here it is. Here, look, this knife used to belong to your grandfather. And then it belonged to me. And I believe that objects carry memories of the person they belong to. And now I'm giving it to you. I’ll have a coffee. - I'll have some coffee as well. - Black coffee? - Black coffee? - Yes. Can I get another piece of pie please? Miss? Miss? Can I get another piece of pie please? You can take it yourself. That seems like an exciting book. You don't think that... that Alex and Sarah... You think they had a thing together? You should ask Sarah. What do you mean "ask Sarah"? Do you think so? - Great, just tell me when. - I've got a few people who want to... - That would be great. - Hello. I'm looking for a book by Alex Abadie, "Art and Decay... I'm looking for a book by Alex Abadie, "Art and Decay". That's too bad, I had it until last week, but I sold it. - A girl from Antwerp bought it. - From Antwerp? Hey Sarah. Hey Sarah. No, I found something about Alex. No, I found something about Alex. I've come to see how work's going. Dad. You should have texted me. You never answer my texts. So, we removed those three paintings this afternoon, and after lunch... So, we removed those three paintings this afternoon, and after lunch... we're doing the others. And to which company will they be taken? The paintings will be restored by an Italian firm. Here in Ghent. Starting next week, we'll be working there as well. I’ll show you what we've done so far. I'll show you what we've done so far. This is a 19th century chapel. Those golden pieces are difficult to restore. - That over there took more than five years. - Five? But it's starting to look better. I'm proud of you. I think we'll be working on it for two more weeks at least... It took a lot of preparation. And you were able to find that particular shade of red? Yes, eventually, with some help... Bruno! It's been a while since we last saw each other! It's been a while since we last saw each other! No more beard? Only in my jokes. I've had the pleasure... to meet your daughter. She's got her mother's beauty and talents. She's got her mother's beauty and talents. And you're still cleaning up paintings? You as well, so I've heard. I heard you've got a house in Italy. In Ghent... the Rome of Flanders, Belgium and the whole world. The whole world. Damn it! Well, this has certainly gotten a hold on you! Going all the way to Breda for this book... I've been up all night reading. "Some restorers believe pieces to have a birth, life and inevitable death." "Some restorers believe pieces to have a birth, life and inevitable death." "It's our duty to preserve artworks so they remain in their original state." You think that's fanatic? Definitely! "We can stop time's destructive nature but this can't work in a museum." And it gets worse. And it gets worse. "A genuine friend of the old masters would never put paintings in a museum" It all makes sense. "Friends of the old masters", he's constantly stating... how art is too fragile to be put in a museum. There's also an entire chapter about people who share his opinions. Just imagine, so many people are unaware that they're looking at fakes. But what they don't know, can't hurt them, that's what he thinks. But what they don't know, can't hurt them, that's what he thinks. And what do you suppose happens to the originals? I don't know, maybe they're sold to some wealthy Russian. Of course it's brilliant... They replicate the paintings during their restoration... They replicate the paintings during their restoration... if that's true, we're talking about billions. This painting will soon be in an exposition at the Musée d'Orsay. And don't forget that it's worth roughly a million. Will you be restoring that vandalized painting? Will you be restoring that vandalized painting? I don't know, but of course I know it better than anyone. Alex? Well, I'm just a passerby... a character on Sarah's canvas. Bastards... Investigation into suspicious restoration of "The Judgment of Solomon" leads to nothing. The curator resigns and takes his own life... Do you think there's a connection here? I wouldn't be surprised at all... Not now Sarah, later. "The Judgment of Solomon" - May I ask you something? - Yes. I'm looking for the museum's restoration-reports... from around 1985 until approximately 1990. Here's 86... Here's 86... 87... and 88. Restoration-report "The Judgment of Solomon". Restoration firm Viktor Van der Veken Hey Sarah, it's Valerie... I found something on "The Judgment of Solomon". I read in the archives that Victor van der Veken restored it himself. I think he's involved. And I know that you like working with these people. But I think something's off. But I think something's off. Can you call me back? Piccione, Italy Piccione, Italy Are you looking for Sarah? Not really. So, what's the deal with this Alex? You should ask Sarah. Have you been to Breda lately? Yes, how do you know? I was looking for that book too. - You've also been to Breda? - Yes. What exactly do you know... about Alex? He was Sarah's mentor... Sophie, I don't want to talk about this, I don't like to intrude. It's just a pity that Sarah never tells me about these things. I know, but... don't worry too much, I know she... is not seeing Alex anymore, and that's a good thing. Dossier Friends of the Masters, by Sarah Grégoire and Valerie Locht. Good afternoon. We have a 10.30 a.m. appointment with Mr. Gallet. Grégoire and Locht. It's like waiting for detention... Like we played a prank in high-school. I'm so jumpy... Thank you. There's no milk. Oh my, a museum without milk! Did you ever do this when you were little? With sugar-cubes? My grandmother does that with cognac. My name is Maarten van den Broeck, the museum's communication-manager. I'll make it quick: Mr. Galet will not participate in this meeting. This morning we discussed your letter in our meeting, and rejected it. But I called this morning to confirm our meeting. You've sure come up with some exciting things... like a detective-novel. It's a little far-fetched. Mr. Galet is a very busy man... I'm sure you understand. Keep in mind, ladies, that you can't just say stuff like that. Slander will be prosecuted. We're being threatened, Sarah. I'm still finishing my coffee though. You OK? What a rude fellow. That says it all, doesn't it? - I hope we'll find someone who'll... - Wait, I think I see someone... Cyril! Sarah? - What are you doing here? - And you? You left us just like that, without an explanation. - It's complicated. But we could have a drink, and I'll explain it to you. I'd love to, but I don't have time for friends right now. But I'm glad you left Alex and the others, they're no good. Are you talking about the "Friends of the Masters?". You know about that project? Shit! I have to go. Hey! Valerie? Bye, Theo. - Hi. - Hey. I left everything where I found it. How often have I told you to put a lock on your door? Impossible! Unbelievable! - Hello Nino. - Hello Salvatore, how's everything? I've got good news... and less good news. - More coffee? - Yes. We should actually drink Spumante, but we'll get to that later. Come on Salvatore. What's so important for you to come all the way to Piccione? We've got it! The big piece. Alex's work is back in the museum already. We've got it Nino! The "Ghent Altar Piece... Listen to me carefully: The transport will happen on Thursday the 26th at about 5 a.m. We'll need a space of 30 square meters and five extra helpers. You'll understand that nothing can go wrong here. Yes, I get it. The replica is phenomenal! We have made a 3D-scan of the surface for the first time... and transferred it to authentic 15th-century panels. But that's also the bad news... This process was so expensive... that we'll have to postpone the last of the depot's renovations. And we'll also have to cut down on the staff. Temporarily of course. Unbelievable... That is irresponsible. It's the third time that this is being postponed. We've been waiting a long time for better security systems. And if you're going to fire people on top of that... I'm doing everything on my own as it is already. - And now this! - No no, please don't worry! Our biggest security measure is that nobody knows the depot exists. But if something is wrong, you have to tell me. Is something wrong? No, nothing's wrong. It's better if you don't know. There there! Nino is a professional. We're talking about postponing it a couple of months. So now... Let's have some Spumante! I said Spumante! - It's me, Cyril. Calm down. - Cyril, are you crazy? What's wrong with you! You were talking about Vanitas... - I've got something for you. - "Vanitas?" When you see this you'll understand. I have to leave the country tonight. But look at the photos, write your thing, and I'll supply the pictures. But how do you know we're writing about... It's a huge international project. I was going to explain... - If that's true, we're talking about billions... You were talking about Vanitas. I've got something for you... You understand I'm a bit surprised. I arranged this internship for you. If there's a problem... you can tell me. Yes, magnificent... I've never seen anything like it! But it's not the real thing. No. Are you willing to confirm that when we go public with this? You do realize what you're getting yourselves into? But alright, I'll add my signature. You can use my name. Armando, it's me. Yes, I know. We'll talk about that later. No, everything is not fine. Who on your shift smokes? Armando, quit the bullshit, answer me! I just found a cigarette in the depot. Fire this bastard immediately, or you'll be the one who gets kicked out. Then you'll have to find out who smokes during the night-shift. You know I couldn't care less if this place burns down. But if that happens they'll have my head for it! Stupid amateurs... - Vera. - It's Valerie. - Are you looking for Sarah? - I'm actually here for you. For me? Come in. I should go visit Sarah sometime. It's been too long. But... your project. You were writing an essay on... It's not an essay. It's more like a file on... shocking discoveries about art and restoration. Sarah has discovered something in Paris, and we're investigating it. In Alex's studio? Yes, but we think there's more to it. We think that, all over Europe... museums are being filled with replicas. That's quite a story! And why are you telling me? Victor Van der Veken. Sarah refuses to believe it, but I think he's involved in this... and you know him better than anyone. "Better than anyone"... Our company was terminated long ago, and after that we grew apart... But I don't think Victor would do something like that. And does the term "Friends of the Masters" mean anything to you? We think this replica-project is called "Vanitas". And Victor restored "The Judgment of Solomon", which has been replicated. That's a lot of information. Don't just jump to conclusions. I can tell you, for starters... that I restored " The Judgment of Solomon" myself. And this was the reason why Victor and I stopped working together. Furthermore I need some time to think. You've bombarded me with information. Vienna Dad? Do you know what time it is? - Can I come in? - Yes. Can I have a drink? Whiskey? I'll have a muffin please. Do you want to sit down? - "Revealing Vanitas" - Yoeri, put that back! Exciting. Valerie. I can explain. Really. Twenty years ago, when Victor and I owned a company together. We had made a name for ourselves. We got the commission to restore "The Judgment of Solomon". With that, we had the chance to join this amazing project: Vanitas. There you go. This initiative was built to safeguard art from destructive circumstances... like vandalism, thieves... everything. But Victor refused to cooperate. Dad? - Have you spoken to Valerie? - No, why? Have you put anything in the mail yet? - What do you mean? I haven't heard from you in weeks. Quit the drama, have you put your file in the mail yet? Yes, all of it. Valerie, what's the matter? I just got the strangest phonecall from my dad. Dad? Dad! Dad's not here. I talked to him last night. Why do you think he sent you to Alex? A new generation of Vanitas. Pick up, pick up! Yes! Magda sweetheart, it's you. No, I've been trying to reach Salvatore for an hour. Things are going wrong... They're letting me take the blame... No, you don't understand. Nobody's answering their phones. I'm on my own... Yes. you're right... I'll do it. You stay at home. You know I couldn't care less if this place burns down. Something's always been wrong at home. That's why I did some research of my own after I overheard you and Valerie. Dad was acting weird. I've looked everywhere, I thought I'd lost them. Thanks.
