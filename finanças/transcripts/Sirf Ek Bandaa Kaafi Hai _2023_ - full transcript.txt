Should have waited till the FIR was filed, Chaudhary sir. Cover your face with your veil, child. We'll have to go for the medical. Cover yourself. 'My name is Nu Singh.' 'Age 16 years.' 'I study at Baba's Bhindwara Ashram school.' 'One day, when I suddenly took ill, ' 'disciple Meena claimed I've been possessed.' 'And I must meet Baba for a solution.' 'The warden said he's spoken with Baba, ' 'and I should go meet him.' 'He touched my private parts, ' 'and I felt disgusted.' 'I was terrified.' Without spiritualism, wisdom cannot be awakened. Without the grace of God, you cannot attain spiritualism. We are a prisoner of our minds. Breaking free of this prison is the one true motive of human life. We have only 15 minutes. People have begun assembling in different parts of the city. Don't let your actions disrupt the harmony of this place. This is just a conspiracy. A clever one. Influential people are at play here. Let them fulfill their wishes. It's not a big deal if I go to jail once. It will be a new experience for me to learn. I'll hold 'Satsangs' in there too. Please move aside quickly. Make a quick exit. - Let's go. Let's go. - Let Baba go! Let Baba go! Baba! Let Baba go! Baba! 'Dozens of people will be reaching Jodhpur in support of Babaji.' 'The DM of Jodhpur has passed orders for curfew and appealed to the public to maintain peace.' 'The DCP of Jodhpur police has assured that the situation at the camp is under control.' Jodhpur police is busy making intense security arrangements. But on the other hand the disciples claim that this is a conspiracy and Baba is being framed. Time will tell what the facts are. Say Om. Om! Buddy. Who is 'Shivji'? Shivji is the destroyer of all demons and darkness. The slayer of all monsters. Demons? For instance, greed, lust... These are the foundation of all evil. One minute. What happened? Shivji, please slay the demon inside me. Which demon have you been possessed by, buddy? Greed. Keeps insisting I have ice cream all the time. You know what. Pour more water. Slay it completely. Say Om. Om! 'The DCP has told our reporters that, ' 'Baba's interrogation is over.' 'And he will be presented in the court soon.' People these days are out to defame honest and benevolent people. What is it this time? BP. Your BP, mom. How am I looking? Smart. Salman Khan! Har Har Mahadev! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Section 342, 370/4. 120B. 506. 354A. Section 376D. Section 376 2F. Section 509 Indian Penal Code. Section 5G/6. And section 7/8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012. And section 23, Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act 2000. Guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. I am innocent. Public prosecutor. Your honour, prima facie evidence clearly suggests, the involvement of the culprit in the crime. So we appeal to the honourable court, for 15 days of police custody. - Defence counsel. - Your honour, I am surprised that my client's anticipatory bail is rejected. I already have doubts and suspicion, over the way, Jodhpur police have done the perseverance of the crime scene, in Sanai Ashram. Mr. Sharma, you are challenging Jodhpur police's investigation. No. Not just Jodhpur police. I am also challenging, Delhi Police's method of registering the case. Your honour, I request the court to grant judicial custody to my client. And let the police file charges in the time frame first, and then start the trial. 15-days police custody... granted. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Take your belongings off here. Sir. He's got permission to come in. - What is it? - Hari Om. What is this? You cannot take that inside. These are Guruji's favourite. You eat it first. Assume Baba has eaten them too. - Take him outside. - Guruji. Bhai said only one day. - Get him out! - Just one more day. You will be free after that, to do good to the people. Go on. Hello. I asked you repeatedly. We could have used other means. I assure you, - we will get bail. - When? High-profile cases like these, follow a lengthy process. And since the 'Nirbhaya' case, several modifications have been made to the law, bhai. 500% guarantee... Baba is coming out on bail. Don't worry. Get the POCSO charge dropped. Otherwise, it will ruin us all. Only the chargesheet has been filed. The charges haven't been framed yet. Just watch, this case won't stand in the next hearing. - Hello. - Hello. I come bearing good news for you. I've sent him behind bars. This calls for a celebration. There was no need for this. You have it, please. Please, help yourself. Maybe later. I also brought some mango juice for your daughter. She isn't here. She is in the bathroom. Come. We need to discuss something important. You will have to stay here for a couple of days more. And in this righteous battle, I am on your side. Even if I've to put my life at stake, I will get justice for this child. Right now, people are watching us like scavengers. Looking for an opportunity. So, I request you not to meet anyone without my permission. And won't give any statement to anyone, without discussing it with me first. You see, any wrong statement, can change the direction of the case. I know all this. But please, give me a copy of the charge sheet. Yes, I will. It's not a big deal. You didn't give it the last four times I asked you. Please give it this time. I will. Take care. I'll see you. How are you, child? I brought some mango juice for you. Have some. See you. See you soon. Yeah, hello. Wait a minute. His keys... Opportunities like this are rare. And you want me to give it up, for 10 million! Negotiate with him. Keep increasing the rate. Demand at least 100 million. The client is in my control. Yes. Let them know, agreeing to my conditions is in their best interest. Otherwise, they will have to pay a heavy price later. It's a good thing you found out while there was still time. He was our only hope, Sial sir. Well, if you agree, I might be able to help you. Drink tea. Here you go. Solanki sir. Chetna ma'am referred us to you. You are aware of Baba's case. They are her parents. - Hello. - Chetna ma'am suggested us your name. Me? Why? It's rare to find a lawyer in this city, who understands POCSO as well as you We all want you to fight this case. Munnu, is the sugar okay? Yes, mother. Finish your tea. Uncover your face, child. You've nothing to be afraid of here. Come one by one. Begin. It was a Saturday. Roughly between 8 and 9 pm. The warden called, saying your daughter has taken ill. Come to Bhindwara immediately. When I arrived at Bhindwara, sir, - they said... - The child is possessed. She must be taken to Baba in Delhi. Hari Om. We are here to see Babaji. Babaji is not in the ashram. - Not in the ashram. - No. But on arriving in Delhi, we learned, that he had already left. When we spoke with disciple Pradeep, he said... He is in Jodhpur. Babaji is in Ashram. Come down here. We headed straight for the Jodhpur Ashram. The definition of true devotion, is complete surrender to your Guru. We arrived at Ashram. On noticing us, Baba immediately said, "You are here, Jatt". I was overwhelmed. I bowed before Baba. To cure her condition, she needs to be cleansed first. She is under your care now, Baba. I've nothing to worry about. Blessed... Everyone will be blessed. Wait out here, and chant 'Hari Om'. I'll call her inside soon. Yes, Baba. His disciple Pradeep showed up after some time. - He said... - You two rest out here. Child, you can come in. Don't be afraid, child. Tell me everything clearly. Tell me. When I went inside the tent, the lights were switched off. He grabbed my hand and said, become my disciple. Education is worthless. These government officers do my bidding. Then he got up. He locked the door. He started to undress me. I tried to scream. But he gagged my mouth with his hand. Then he touched me everywhere, sir! Well done. Well done. You will have to be brave, child. There's no telling what you might be asked at the court. Please have it. I'll get some rest, and you continue chanting, okay. What happened, child? He is no God, mother! I must meet Babaji. - But Babaji is not in the ashram. - Move aside. I must meet him. - I told you he isn't here. - I want to talk to him. Move aside. Baba is not in the ashram. Stay back. - Move aside. I must speak to him... - Get lost. Stay back! Before I take up your case, Mr. Paramvir, I want to tell you a story. A couple of days ago, a biker... Here in Jodhpur. Was cheerfully riding his bike. When he came around 100 meters from the traffic signal, the light changed from green to yellow. At the same time, a father was helping his son cross the road. When the biker came face-to-face with them, he braked pretty hard. But eventually, he ran over the child's leg. The child screamed. He was taken to the hospital. The doctor examined him. He said he was fine. But soon, the child's leg was in tremendous pain. His entire leg turned blue. He was then taken to an expert. When he checked, he said it was a fracture. And needed to be operated on. The father was poor. He had no money. He sued the biker, and I was the lawyer. So... legally, who should I be prosecuting? The biker, sir. Right? But I prosecuted three people. The biker, who didn't slow down even after the light turned yellow. The doctor who made the wrong diagnosis. And... the father. Who made the child unsafely cross the road. Because the victim in this entire incident is the child. In my lifetime, I've seen dozens of cases. Explicit crimes. Several victims. Even in this case, I'll be encountering several pressures, persuasions, threats, dangers... Everything. Believe me, mister. I've seen many of them turn around on their statements. It was incredibly courageous of you to come here. But it's going to be a long battle, mister. Sir. - Fees... - What? What will be your legal fee? Her smile. Mr. Sharma. - Solanki sir. - How are you doing? All good. Didn't see you at the cafe? Didn't wake up. I was late. Been enjoying lately. You know how my wife is. That's one less thing I've to worry about. All rise. Sit. Sit. Yes. My Lord, based on the chargesheet filed by the police, post-investigation, all offences of section 376 IPC, section 120B, and the POCSO act seems made out. Defence. Your honour, POCSO doesn't apply in this case. Because on the day of occurrence, that is on the intervening night of 13th and 14th of August 2013, the girl was a major and not a minor. She was an adult, your honour. Do you have any supporting documents? - Yes, your honour. - Show. Your honour, this is an undisputed admission document from Dayanand Sagar, her primary school. Her birth date is clearly mentioned here. 4-7-1994. And if we calculate according to this date, then on the date of occurrence, Nu was over 18 years old. Therefore, I request the honourable court, to drop the charges of juvenile and POCSO act. I want a copy. You'll get a copy too. Be patient. Be patient. Any comments on the medical report? No, sir. Public prosecutor. The complainant's counsel will argue. That is acceptable to me. Thank you, sir. The respected defence lawyer, Mr. Pramod Sharma, is an extremely experienced and intelligent lawyer. I will also add that this is his plan B. Counsel in defence knows, the charges against Baba will be framed today. You seem pretty sure. - No, your honour. Maybe a little. - How? In order to save his client, his entire focus will be to get the POCSO Act against Babaji dropped. - Am I right? - Absolutely. Your honour, the document which the counsel in defence is referring to, is under the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection rule 12 is barred. Rule 12 states that if the matriculation certificate is available, then only that document should be considered. In case it's not present, then the school certificate, and if that's not available, then a municipality certificate. And if all three are unavailable, then a medical test should be conducted for age determination. While making the chargesheet with other necessary documents, the police attached this matriculation certificate. And the date of birth clearly mentioned here is 4-7-1996. When the first stage document is available, all other documents have no importance, your honour. And what does Rule 12 state? Rule 12 expressly states, "to determine the age of the victim," a play school certificate will not be entertained." It is excluded. So I'd like to say, that victim Nu is totally minor. Thank you. Just a second, sir. What is it now? We cannot deny that there was no foul play. If two different dates are mentioned in two separate documents, then it's subject to a 50-50 rule. - Yes, you are correct. - Yes. That's why you are going to prove that she is an adult. And Solanki sir will prove she is a minor. That's how cases are fought, Mr. Sharma. Your honour, the girl should undergo an age-related medical test. Mr. Solanki just quoted Rule 12. So? Well. I'm not withdrawing any of the charges right now. All the charges framed on Baba stay. And this document that you submitted, is marked as subject to objection. Your honour, if this document is marked as subject to objection, I would like to call Principal Bapat of the play school, for chief examination. Why, sir? I don't think that's needed... - No, but... - This is done. No, no... Mr. Sharma. I don't think this is a problem. - Permission granted. - Yes. Thank you, sir. Case dismissed. Who is this Solanki? We'll handle him. We should have settled this with the other lawyer. This is getting too complicated. We'll get bail in every condition. Enough. Let it be. I'll deal with this my way. Guruji. Bhai said two months. Just two more months. After that you'll be out doing welfare work. What is the matter, sir? Why do you look stressed? Bittu, I cannot lose a single hearing of this case. If I do, then Baba will get bail. And we'll never get our hands on him again. Food is really nice. Eat. What is it this time? Take care of your BP. - Hello. - Paramvir sir. Yes, sir. When you found out about Nu, did you tell anyone else? Veerpal Singh, sir. I told him before filing the FIR. - Veerpal Singh. - He's a family friend. Will he show up if we call him? Or do I send him police summon. Not at all, sir. He is a friend. Another thing, Paramvir. Nu's admission form, registration form, TC, report card, etcetera... Send it to me. Also. The Principal of Saraswati School Madhukar Tripathi, will have to testify. You inform him. Okay, sir. What happened with your daughter was terrible, Mr. Paramvir. These are all her documents. Thank you, sir. Sir, you may have to come to Jodhpur. Don't worry. Bittu. Mummy. Did Buddy leave for school. - Case... We won the case. - Get up. - Get dressed and meet me at the court. - Yes. Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! 'After his bail was denied in sessions court five times, ' 'Baba has now approached the high court.' 'Can one of the most celebrated lawyers of the country Ram Chandwani, ' 'get Baba out on bail today?' Sir... sir... What do you think? Can you get Baba out on bail? Please, sir. Your comments. Sir... Sir, would be great if I could get a photo with him. You never asked me for one. Respected judge, I, Ram Chandwani, stand before this honourable court, to file a bail application for Baba. So, your honour, let's start from the beginning. - An adult female... - I object, your honour. Sorry, sir. Senior learned counsel cannot use the word 'adult'. I can, Mr. Solanki. Because I believe she is an adult. Just as you believe she is a minor. Sir, my statements are not based on belief, they are based on hard evidence. I will... I will get to that. First Information report, we all know as FIR. Is filed in a police station, which has no connection with the crime scene. I object, your honour. On grounds of zero First Information report, also known as Zero FIR, is applied here. And I don't know why, the senior learned counsel is turning this into an issue. I, Ram Chandwani, request the honourable judge, to stop Mr. Solanki from intervening while I make my statement. - Mr. Solanki. - Yes. You won't say a word now. You'll be heard too. - Mr. Chandwani, proceed. - Thank you. Before the case is registered, on the basis of the roznamcha, a female cop takes the so-called victim to a government hospital, and a medical test is performed. And they act according to their own free will. And based on this description, an FIR is filed. Your honour, it's a well-established decree of law, the victim cannot be taken for a medical examination, before filing an FIR. And if you take a good look at the medical report, you will realise how Delhi police conducted medical examination first. And then file an FIR with complete disregard for the law and its rules. On the basis of the so-called victim's statement, they filed an FIR against Baba! And arrested him! Where there is no evidence of penetration, and insertion. Hymen is also not ruptured. Is this rape at all, my lord? The entire medical report, the FIR, and the victim's age, is a big-big lie. This proves that the entire investigation, was carried out under pressure. My lord, and to malign my client's reputation, a conspiracy was hatched. This is grave injustice to a man of his stature, my lord. My client isn't just a client, he's a symbol of this country's faith. How can anyone stoop so low, for the sake of money and fulfilling his personal agenda? How can a lie be told by the Delhi police, spread like an epidemic? And this is my request, the investigation should be handed over to the CBI. And I request the court to grant him bail. That's all, my lord. - Mr. Solanki. - Yes. Thank you, your honour. Our senior learned counsel, raised some pretty important points. And I completely agree with you, if this was a normal case. But this is hardly a normal case. The gist of it all is POCSO. What is POCSO? Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012. It was implemented after Delhi's Nirbhaya case. - Come to the point, mister. - I am. I am. Our senior learned counsel, hasn't done his homework on the POCSO Act, he doesn't know much about it, or he's trying to mislead the court. How dare you? Are you accusing me of lying in the court? Let me complete, sir. I am sorry, sir. I just want to present certain facts to the court. And what are these facts? According to the POCSO law, if the accused has touched the victim's private parts who is less than 18 years old, your honour, then it falls under rape 376. Penetration or insertion in this case is not necessary. And I am not saying this. - It's written here. - I know what POCSO says. Then Mr. Chandwani, you will also know, the POCSO law section 27 allows us, to conduct a medical examination of the victim before the FIR, on the condition there is a female police officer present, as well as a relative of the victim. The definition of arguments in the court, is which of us Is right. But this is not an ordinary case. Rather than who is right, focus should be on 'what is right'. A minor girl... Minor victim is being proved as an adult. And as evidence they have nothing. And except for all the yelling and baseless talks, if they have any solid proof, then present it to the court. I am ready to argue. This is a rarest of the rare case, your honour. He shouldn't be given bail, period. That is all. That hurt. Sorry, my lord. I want to bring court's attention, to the fact that Delhi Police, is governed under the provisions of Punjab Police rule. And Punjab Police categorically states first an FIR and then medical test, which Delhi Police did not follow. And the way this law was ignored, and the FIR was filed in a haste. There is a severe doubt in all proceedings. I would like to plead to the honourable court, that my client Baba should be given bail. He deserves it. That's all, my lord. Yes, Mr. Solanki. Thank you, your honour. Your honour, this is a established principle of the interpretation of the law, that the provisions of the special law, will always prevail over the general law. And POCSO is an act. Putting it in simpler terms, this is a law introduced in 2012, which equally applies all over the country. And the provisions of Punjab Police which our senior counsel is stating is a rule. And the court knows, that any rule of the Punjab Police cannot have any overriding effect on the POCSO act. So, in the end I would like to say, that the bail application should be denied. That is all. Bail denied. Court dismissed. One picture... Sir, one picture. You wanted a picture. You embarrassed me. Baba's case represented by senior lawyer Ram Chandwani, faced failure today, when the court rejected Baba's bail plea. Ram Chandwani refuses to comment, but the story continues. Chandwani sir, I didn't expect this from you. It happens sometimes. I am not God. I've sent you my invoice. Please do it on priority. Guruji, Bhai says only six months. Six more months. Then you'll be out doing welfare to the people. How much? 200 million. This is an advance. The rest when Baba gets bail. - Mom... - Yes. What can we buy in Jodhpur with 200 million? We can buy half the city, son. Do you want it? Who is going to clean it? I am happy with what I have. Mom doesn't need it. Your mother is an old woman now. I can understand she doesn't need it. But what about your son? His future? Mr. Mishra, you should have left by now. - What? - Get up and leave. - If you want... - Get up. - Mr. Mishra... - I said get up. Get up. Anger doesn't suit your smiling face. Want to see my grinning face? Sub-inspector Sial speaking. Sial sir, you are still awake. You know, in our line of work time hardly matters. It's duty after all. How can I be of service? Nothing. Just thought of you. Mister. Take your bag. Yes... I thought you won't pick up. - Close the door... - Yes, sir. What happened? All good? Absolutely. It was just the neighbours. The recording of statement of the witnesses, in connection to the rape case against Baba, begins today in Jodhpur's session court. My name is Veerpal. Paramvir Singh met me after arriving in the city, and told me everything that happened with them. And said he's going to Delhi to speak with Baba. I am Mrs. Bapat. Principal of Dayanand Sagar School. I have submitted Nu's registration, admission form and report cards as proof. My name is Raj Sajjan, and I've been working in Baba's ashram since 1995. In 2003, a girl called Gudiya told me, that he raped her. Soon after we heard similar news from Bhiwani, Pushkar, Haryana. Baba would shine a torch on a girl during the religious gatherings and signal her. And the girl would stay with him. Once I personally saw Baba misbehaving with a female. The standard of questions can be pretty low. They will try their best to break you. But don't be afraid, child. How long have you known, Baba? 10 years. Were you initiated? Yes. I used to donate 10% of my income to Baba. In fact, I even borrowed money from the bank, and built his ashram in my city. I surrendered my body, mind and soul in his service. What is your relationship with the girl? I am Nu's father. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You used your own daughter to trouble a decent man, to fulfil your ulterior motives. - What did you say? - I am right. Mind your language. I will break your jaw! - No, no... - Sir... Not in the court. Control. Sorry, sir. You can go. You come, Ms. Nu. Are you afraid of your father? Your honour, what is this? He is asking irrelevant questions. Objection overruled. Proceed, Mr. Sharma. Do you always listen to him? Yes. Because you are afraid of him. No. No. When did you get initiated by Baba? - Six years ago. - So you must be 12-years-old then. No. I was 10-years-old. Okay. If you say 10, we'll believe you were 10. Do you believe you were old enough to understand, who you should get initiated by? Who told you to follow him? My family. Who in the family? Be specific. - Papa. - You were afraid of him. - No. - You could have said no. No. So you were afraid of him. When and where did you plan to frame Baba? You don't have to be afraid of your father today. We are here to support you. We will give you police protection. We didn't plan anything. I told you what Baba did to me. Your honour, I object. No need to object. Relax, Mr. Solanki. Are you comfortable? Ms. Nu, what was your percentage in class 10 and 11. 86% in class 10, and 56% in 11th. Why the big drop in percentage? You are having an affair, aren't you? Counsel, think about your seniority. Stop asking such irrelevant questions. - What is irrelevant about it? - Asking a 16 year old about affairs. - This is my question. - I am free to ask such questions. Ask your question. How is her percentage connected to this? Please maintain the decorum of the court. Please. There is no affair. I shifted from MP board to CBSE Board, that's why my percentage dropped. That's all, your honour. Thank you. Good job. Come. This disciple Pradeep can be pretty useful. Yes, sir. He was the closest on the day of the incident. I want to grill him. If he admits, Bittu... I got it, sir. Sir... I found out something new last night, sir. - What? - Mahesh Bhavchandani... He provided legal assistance to all the victims in all the cases against Baba and his son. What are the cases? Land grabbing, molestation. So they have been at it for pretty long. This is very important, Bittu. Connect with him. If you face any problem, then take Sial sir's help. Yes, sir. I'll call you. - Tell mom to make some tea. - Yes, sir. Where is Pradeep? Pradeep. He hasn't come home since he was released from jail. Bhai, Mahesh Bhavchandani, and the other two female disciples have filed a rape case against you. You must leave immediately. Mahesh Bhavchandani, the prime witness in the rape cases against Baba and his son, was brutally murdered in broad daylight by throwing acid. Out of the way. Move your bike. Move. Sial sir. Save me. Catch them. Stop. Stop. Come here. Hello. Where is he? - Who, sir? - Madhukar Tripathi. The principal of Saraswati Sishumandir. Open it. You don't have to be afraid. And if you are afraid, then look at her face. You must stay firm on your statement. Everyone is safe here. Understood. Chetna madam. Any news of disciple Pradeep. Not yet, Solanki sir, but we'll find him soon. Find him soon, madam. You are glowing today. They are not your witnesses. They are not? He's a real scum. After two months of hide-n-seek, Gujarat police finally arrested Baba's son under rape charges. You will soon be out to do welfare of the people. My lord, the defence repeatedly claimed that the victim was an adult, on the day of the occurrence. And they are trying to prove this, by hook and by crook. And I would try to prove, your honour, that the victim was a minor on the day of the occurrence. And for that, I would like to call Mrs. Bapat to the stand. Permission granted. Come, Mrs. Bapat. I swear on Ram, that I shall speak only the truth. Go on then. What was your post in Dayanand Sagar School? I was the principal. My Lord, when Mrs. Bapat, came to the court for chief examination, she presented the promotional certificate, admission form and registration form, in support of her statement. But these were play school documents, and according to the juvenile justice care and Protection Rule 12, play school documents are not allowed. So you placed these three documents under subject to objection, your honour. But now she's furnished a fourth document. And what is this fourth document? Your Honour, last time she submitted, the class promotion certificate from Dayanand Sagar school. It has two entries. Nursery. KG 1. But doesn't have principal madam's signatures or a stamp. This time she submitted a fourth document. Again, the promotional certificate. Take a look. There are two extra entries. Nursery. KG 1, KG 2, Class 1. This has the principal madam's signatures and school stamp. Two documents of the same class promotion certificate, your Honour. So obviously, this document has been improvised. It's a fake and has been forged. Mrs. Bapat, tell us why did you furnish the fourth document, which is the promotional certificate? All the documents we had of Nu in school, I submitted all of them. Would you like some water? Son, give her some water. No, thank you. I don't want it. You don't. But you are going to need it. Believe me. I don't need it. You look pretty excited, madam. Let's add to your excitement. So did you issue the fourth document, which is the promotional certificate? No. I think it was issued by someone from the staff. I don't remember clearly. Meaning you don't remember, whether the document is authentic. No, it was done in my presence. So it is authentic. So you remember the document, but not who signed it. This promotional certificate, was intentionally brought to the court, your honour. To prove that Nu, which is the victim, studied till class 1 in her school Dayanand Sagar. On the contrary, the truth is something else. Bittu. Give it here. Your honour, these two documents are from Saraswati Sishumandir. This one is the victim Nu's admission certificate in Saraswati Sishumandir. And the date of birth is written as 4-7-1996. '96'. Your honour, the other one is a letter from Saraswati Sishumandir, where it's clearly stated... Due to Nu's outstanding performance, she is being directly promoted to class 2. And not class 1. Please take a look. This proves, your Honour, that the victim Nu never went to class 1. Neither in her school which is Dayanand Sagar school, nor in Saraswati Sishumandir, and the proof is right in front of you, in the form of that letter. Would you like some water? Was she the only Nu in this entire city? I wonder what logic you are applying here. Stop sounding so frustrated. If she is smart and brilliant, then that's a fact, your honour. Now you are sounding jealous. Stop distracting me. Let me speak. Mrs. Bapat, is it wrong to say, that Nu's birthdate is '96. It's wrong. She was born in '94. Is it right to say, filling out the registration form doesn't guarantee admission? That's true. Then is it wrong to say, that admission is only confirmed after paying the fee. That's not wrong. Then where is the fee? Give us the fee receipts and the bills. There is no mention of any fee. Photo? Nu's photo. Give us something. These verbal claims mean nothing. Point to be noted, my lord. Registration certificate or admission certificate doesn't have any mention of the fee. This means their claim that the victim Nu, has studied in Dayanand Sagar school is doubtful. Would be right to say Mrs. Bapat, if Nu was admitted to your school, then you didn't issue her a TC certificate, during her admission to Saraswati Sishumandir? Stop asking me right or wrong! Why don't you ask me directly? Okay, I'll ask you directly? Did you issue a TC? - No, I didn't. - You didn't issue a TC to her? - No, I didn't issue a TC to her. - She wasn't admitted to your school. No, she was not. When she wasn't admitted to her school, your Honour, how could she issue a TC? She is absolutely right. And yet, based on fake documents, they are trying to prove her birth year as 1994. On the admission form of Saraswati Sishumandir, and matriculation certificate issued by the MP board, which is in the public domain, verified by the police which is found to be original, states her date of birth is 4-7-1996. And even her parents have taken a stand on it. Nu is a minor, your Honour. Is it right? - Is it right? - Enough, please. - Please. - Water. Water. Where is water? Where is it? Please, drink it. Please come, Jiten Singh. How long have you known Baba? - 15 years. - Why did you quit? I was the primary administrator in his Ashram in Ahmedabad. In 2005 there was news of Baba physically abusing females... Okay, fine. In the chief examination, you claimed you supplied special herbs to Baba. Yes. I've been giving Baba special testosterone-boosting herbs. When was the last time you gave him that? Around two months before Baba was arrested, someone from the Ashram came to collect the herbs. Please continue. The two females in Surat, who registered a case against Baba and his son. I know they were physically abused. Then why did you keep quiet? I was afraid. I was hiding like a coward. But I felt ashamed seeing this child's courage, and that's why I am here. That's all, your honour. Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Glory to Baba! Send the Ambulance inside. The attack outside the court, in connection to Baba's case, has everyone stunned. The attacker was arrested at the scene of the crime, and is being questioned. This is the second prime witness in connection with the case, who has been murdered. Before this, the prime witness to the case, Mahesh Bhavchandani was murdered. Who will take responsibility for the security of the witness? Stay tuned to us for more updates in connection to this case. - Buddy, want some ice cream? - Yes. Go ahead. - Okay. - Mister, give him an ice cream. - Hello. - Where are you? I was just heading home. Can you come to the police headquarters for a little while? It's urgent. Shall I drop Buddy home, or come directly? No, drop him home first and then come see us. But be careful. Buddy. Buddy! What are you doing? Eating my ice cream. - Where were you? - I was right behind you. What were you doing behind me? Sit. The situation is pretty serious, Mr. Solanki. We found disciple Pradeep's body outside the city, hanging from a bridge. We're concerned for your life. No, no, no need to worry. I can take care of myself. But we cannot take a risk, Mr. Solanki. I mean every important person related to this case is on high target, sir. Whether it's the victim's family, the witness's family, or you and your family, sir. She is right, Mr. Solanki. We'll need at least 60 personnel for their security. - Really? - Sial, how many can be available? I can arrange for 20, sir. But giving protection to all the victims and witnesses can be difficult. And Solanki sir? He's a local. - I can handle him. - Yes. - Don't worry. - Okay. Victim's family and Solanki sir are a priority. Yes, sir. Buddy, at least say bye. - Bye. - Bye, Buddy. I am scared, sir. You should be. I'm in no mood to go to Shahjahanpur. I've become a puppet in people's hands. They all look at me like I am the culprit. Sometimes I want to commit suicide. You did commit a sin. In the view of those who consider him God. They don't want to believe he's done something ungodly. You did commit a sin, child. Baba is not the enemy in this battle. Your enemy is fear. Anxiety. Inner pain. And, you must fight this battle on your own. Do you know why? Because you had their God arrested. It's time to buckle up, and put up your sword. The war cry has been sounded, child. Har Har Mahadev! Sir, I want to request something? Can I approach the bench? Yes, please. You too. Sir, the victim is a minor, and this is a sensitive case. So, if you could request the others to leave. Let the parents stay. - Mr. Sharma. - Yes, fair enough. Permission granted. Thank you. Thank you. Come here. Tell the people to leave the courtroom. Everyone, leave the courtroom. Vacate the courtroom. The parents can stay. Okay? Nu, have you been to Baba's ashrams in Rishikesh, Delhi, etcetera. - No. - You have been there. Because Baba's chambers in every ashram are similar. You already knew the layout you described in your statement. No. I did not know Was that your first visit to his chamber on the 22nd? No. I went there on the 13th. What happened? - I went to the Bhindwara Ashram... - No. Let's skip straight to Sanai Ashram. What was in there? There was a bed. A fan. Couple of small tables. The door had a latch. Most homes in India have rooms like that. There is a table. Fan. What colour was the fan? I don't remember that. And what colour was the bedsheet? Black. No, it wasn't black. It was blue. Your honour, in the initial statements, there was no detail given about the room. It was mentioned as 'chamber'. Soon a picture is printed in 'Jagrit Samachar'. And details begin adding up on what was inside the chamber. What happened in the chamber after that? When I entered the tent, the lights were off. He was lying on the bed. He sat up. Grabbed my hand. Said "become my follower". Education is worthless. Government officials do my bidding. Then he got up. He locked the door. He started stripping off my clothes. When I tried to scream, he muffled my voice with his hand. And said "if you tell anyone about this", "then I will kill your parents and you." Then he began touching me everywhere. And kissed me. Where did he kiss you? What's happening here? The child is getting uncomfortable. She already recorded her statement, in front of the chief examination officer. If we believe her statement is final, then let's announce the judgement. I must ask, your honour. Mr. Sharma, please proceed with some sensitivity. Thank you, your honour. Yes, sir. I understand. Then what happened? Then he slid his hands underneath my clothes, to touch my private parts! She is crying! Someone get some water! I am sorry, Solanki sir. But I have to ask. Did Baba... ask you to touch his private part? No. But he did push my face downwards. Point to be noted, your honour. My client asked no such thing, and there is no mention of the clothes in the FIR. Your honour, the FIR filed by the so-called victim, under 164 CRPC, statements given in front of the magistrate, and 161, records of questioning by the police, are completely different, your honour. Meaning her statement is different in both places. Sir, according to the supreme court... FIR is not an encyclopaedia. It is just basic first-hand information. That is it. And the victim wasn't in sound mental condition. So there can be a difference in words, your honour. I agree. An incident occurs between the 13th and 14th. Six days later, she files an FIR in Delhi. So she was fighting mental pressure for six days. Six days, your honour. Six days. How is this possible? The one whom I considered God treated me like this. I still cannot believe it, sir. I request, your honour, that her sole evidence cannot be relied upon as gospel truth. And there are no other witnesses, other than the victim herself. I am done with the process, your honour. Thank you. Your honour, as we already know each other, can I ask you something? Yes, please. You spend most of your time in court, like us. What do you want to say? Can you tell us, the colour of the fan on your left? No, sir. Without looking. Can I ask my learned friend, the colour of the dial in the watch his assistant is wearing? Don't ask. Don't cheat. - How would I know the dial? - Exactly. How? We cannot answer two simple questions in broad daylight, your honour. And our learned friend expects, when the victim was being abused, to remember the colour of the pillow and fan. As if she knew she would be abused tonight. And she will be questioned. Respected, Mr. Sharma. A blue blanket looks black in the dark. She was absolutely right. And, your honour, all the exhibits submitted, were recorded before the picture was published in 'Jagrit Samachar'. And there's a date mentioned on the top. You should have read it, Mr. Sharma! Your honour, the victim has already recorded a 94-page statement. And she stood firm on her statement each time. Bravo, child. And he says his client shouldn't be held accountable, based on the victim's statement. Whereas the supreme court has passed several judgements. In rape cases, the victim's statement is solid evidence. If she manages to convince the court, that she is telling the truth! Rajesh. You know I need money. And you're denying me work at a time like this. Please... Hello. Rajesh. He's ruined my entire business. I cannot get any transportation work in the market. How are we going to do this, Anita? We got to fight this together. Stand by our daughter. Veerpal. The fourth witness in the Baba rape case, Veerpal was shot dead today. Veerpal Singh was a close friend of the victim's father. When will the murder of these witnesses stop? Can the witnesses stay firm on their statements in this terrorising situation? Or will they turn hostile? Only time will tell. Hey... let's go. Sir. We'll come back later. Come on. Here. Don't blame the tea. Have it. Sir, please don't fire me from the case. - If I've made a mistake, I'll make sure... - No... No... You are an excellent lawyer. - Then why take me off the case? - Try to understand... - No, sir. I don't want to understand. - I don't want to be out of it. Idiot. Come here. Come here. I will slap you now. Understood. Why don't you understand? The police had a tough time arranging security. This guy. He's always there for me. But just one. And if anything happens to you... I cannot take this tension. Try to understand. Let the case get over, you can join back. Please. - Do I have to beg you? - No, sir. Please, sir. I understand your point. Why are you smiling, Buddy? This is the fifth time, buddy. What? You are polishing your shoe for the fifth time. You look excited like a kid, buddy. Swamiji, can you get Baba bail? Swamiji. Swamiji. Hello, sir. Can I help you? Can I sit, sir? I am a big fan of yours, sir. I am a member of the organisation. That's good. I've read all your articles during the emergency. They are very inspiring, sir. I am so lucky, I will be arguing against you in court. - Are you Poonam Chand? - No! PC... PC Solanki. Wow. We share the same ideology. Yes, sir. Baba is a very noble man, PC. He has millions of followers around the world. He built schools, hospitals, done a lot for humanity. Baba is making the world a better place. Sir... making schools and hospitals, doesn't give you the license to rape. Am I right? All rise. I'll see you later. I am right here. Sit. Sit. Shall I start, your honour? Yes, please. As I landed in Jodhpur, your honour, I learnt that the chief justice of India hails from Jodhpur. And the land of Jodhpur, has gifted several celebrated lawmakers to the country. There is something remarkable about this land. Your honour, during my term as the law minister, I always strived to appoint talented and qualified judges in the supreme court. And my endeavour hasn't changed. Your honour... Sir, can we come to the point... Solanki. - Okay. - Two minutes. - Okay. - I'll sit. Yes, Mr. Swami. But today, I am just representing Baba as a pleader. Your honour, my client is a 75-year-old man. He has several health issues. He passes urine and stool without knowledge, - and... - Your honour. What, Mr. PC? No, sir. I... Okay. Shall I continue, your honour? Yes, Mr. Swami. Please continue. Your honour, the victim's medical report suggests that... Sir... I object, sir. What is it, Solanki? I should be heard. I am very sorry. But it's a matter of utmost importance, sir. Because respected Sri Venkatesh Swamiji, is not allowed to speak on behalf of Baba. What do you mean by that? No, sir. I am very sorry. I apologise. Reference case Harishankar Rastogi vs Girdhari Sharma, 1978. You must know about it. I am just quoting this. It's clearly written here in this para... Any person can be present in place of the pleader for the bail plea, if there's an application from the accused. But in this case, there is no application from Baba. Are you sure about this? I have the document. Come, show me. We'll take one minute. Reference... Solanki. Yes. It's 650. No, sir. It's 1978. I meant your shirt. Remove the tag. Yes, Mr. Venkateshwar. I apologise to the court. Your honour, approaching Baba for permission now, will take an entire day. I've a flight in a couple of hours. - So I would request... - Sir, sorry to interrupt. I apologise. Very sorry. Just for the sake of argument. Please don't take me otherwise. You may argue. Your arguments have enlightened us for several years. You are our hero. But... if the decision doesn't fall in your favour, Swamiji. And tomorrow, if Baba denies you as a pleader. Then, Mr. Swami, it can be mortifying for you and the court. Your honour, it is for you to decide. I am just a small lawyer, sir. Bail denied. Swamiji. What happened in the court? Swamiji. Will Baba get bail? Guruji... Go on. The signal has turned green. Your honour. An important matter that I would like to bring to the court's notice about Baba's health. Baba is suffering from a neurological disorder. A neurological disorder. You heard it right, your honour. It is a pretty serious condition. And it comes with severe pain, and can lead to death if not attended to in time. Your honour, can I know the name of this disease? Trigeminal Neuralgia. Tri... Trigeminal Neuralgia. Tri... Okay. I request the highest court, to grant Baba bail, so he can go to America and get this condition treated. It has a very high suicide rate, if not treated in time. Mr. PC Solanki. - Mr. PC Solanki. - I am sorry. Sorry, sir. Your honour, can I have a moment? It's very urgent, sir. Do you want to waste the highest court's time? No, sir. I am very sorry. But it's very personal, sir. Please. I request you, sir. Okay. We'll take this after lunch. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Hello, Punnu. Can't seem to find Uday. I've been looking for over an hour. Why weren't you answering your phone? Where can he go? He'll be somewhere around. Control yourself. He'll come home. The court is in session. What can I do? Don't worry. I'll do something. Bittu. Buddy hasn't come home for a while. Yes, sir. We are also searching for him. Find him. Find him. He's just a child. What are you there for? Don't worry. I'm looking. Sir. Shall I stop the proceedings? No, no. This is his last door. If he gets out, he'll land directly in America for treatment. And the law's arms aren't long. One of our Bollywood superstars is having the same condition, your honour. I was checking on Google... Are we going to look it up on Google now? Are we to consider this evidence? I kindly request the court to let me finish, please. Bashir sir, kindly allow him to speak. Please continue. Thank you, your honour. This tri... Trige... It's a severe condition, your honour. I agree. But it didn't appear suddenly. There must be some history. He must have been diagnosed somewhere. If you have anything, then please show. I have already shown it. Can I see, sir? A four-year-old disease, which the accused hasn't mentioned to date. Suddenly this... I suspect, your honour, Baba is planning an escape. And with the current scenario in our country of criminals escaping, I request the court not to grant this permission to the accused. This is not the place to do homework. No. No, homework. I was checking that AIIMS has the capacity to find out, if Baba is suffering from this disease or not. But India doesn't have such capable doctors, who can treat this condition. What? I am sorry, sir. An institution like AIIMS conducts a medical entrance exam each year. And only a few selected youngsters are chosen. Someone of our calibre has no doubts, for such a respected institution and the competency of their doctors, But it's up to the honourable supreme court to decide. The test for Trigeminal Neuralgia will be done in AIIMS. We direct the Director of AIIMS, to constitute a board of experts to examine him. And until the reports don't arrive, the decision stays intact. Thank you, your honour. Yes, sir. We found Buddy. Where was he? He went to Mehrangarh Fort with his friends, for ice cream. That idiot. Bail denied. You're back. God bless you. Where is he? He is inside. Where were you? - My friends insisted... - To go where? To go where? To go where? To go where? What are you doing? He is just a kid. Let him go. Come here. Do you want to kill him? Let him go. You cannot handle a single child. What do you expect me to do? Should I quit my job? Do I focus on the case or go looking for my child? What do I do? What happened? In all these years, I've never seen tears in your eyes. What do you think? Did he really commit this evil crime? My opinion doesn't count. That child's truth is above all, which she entrusted in my hands. If I fail to convey her truth to the world, then Which God will I worship? Even Sri Krishna stood alone... With his truth. But he alone was more than a match for the entire Kaurava army. Here's a question. Remember that poem. Which one? One I made you learn as a kid. When hurdles come your way, only cowards face away. But Champions never waver... They never lose patience. They embrace every hurdle, and forge a path through a bed of thorns. Always have a smile on their face, and endure every pain. Endure every pain. Endure every pain. The ongoing rape case against Baba for five years, has finally reached judgement day. We want to remind you, that four main witnesses were murdered during the proceedings, and some are still missing. Looking at the previous public outburst, the police have made strict security arrangements. The raids are still ongoing. Let's look back at the main events between 2013 and 2018. No, no, don't look back. You have my blessings. Go on. Move forward. Come on. Goodbye. D-Day has arrived. After five years of rigorous struggle, Baba has... And Baba has arrived. Closing statements, please. You first. Honourable judge, and honourable court. Today... is judgement day. A judgement which will be remembered for years to come. A judgement, which will always raise questions, on faith and our belief system. Five years, your honour... A case that's been going on for five years... I am sorry... a fake case. I want to shed some light on, how this will affect the welfare of humanity. Baba's organisations, which perform humanitarian deeds, will be shut down. Poor children in our country studying in Baba's institutions, will be deprived of education. Hospitals treating severe and complicated conditions for free, will no longer contribute towards the welfare of humanity! Thousands of people, are provided with meals at Baba's ashram every day. Will have to starve, your honour. A judgement, that can destroy everything. A judgement, on which the future hangs. A judgement that can save the reputation of a great guru and Sanathan Daram, lies in your hands, your honour. Thank you, your honour. Mr. Solanki. Mr. Solanki. Please begin. Thank you, your honour. Your honour, the conflict this case caused, in the past five years. We saw and heard several law experts. Some fought for bail, while some defended this case. Now when this case is on the threshold, of deciding guilty or not guilty, innocent or culprit. It needs a nudge in the right direction. A point that I noticed, your honour. And you must have too. The defence's efforts to defend Baba failed. Challenging the police procedures, raising concerns over POCSO charges, trying to wrongly prove the child is an adult, etcetera, etcetera. I... and whoever is against me, like Mr. Sharma. We are playing our roles as prosecution and defendant. But where did the defence fail in defending Baba? Where? Your honour, they failed to understand a grave crime. They failed to understand the victim's mental condition. They failed to understand, how this crime will affect society. Your honour, a female's life in this country, is full of hurdles. And this particular female is a reflection of their dilemma. I am ashamed to say, your honour. In this great country of ours, every female faces mental and physical abuse at least once in her lifetime. In the entire proceedings, your honour. Some saw her as a victim, and some as a medium to mint money. Some saw her as an object of their lust, and some as TRP. But, your honour, I saw the ferocious form of Kaali in her. Maa Durga. Because she wants to raise her voice! She wants to defend herself! She is a ray of hope, for all those who have their eyes on this verdict! Outside this building. But for the defence counsel, this case is about faith. Nothing beyond that. Your honour, if faith is above all, I want to end this with a story. With your permission! Please conclude, Mr. Solanki. Thank you, sir. You must all know about Ramayan. I am sure you all do. But when Lord Shri Ram slays Raavan in battle. Raavan did not attain salvation. Raavan was Shivji's most cherished devotee. He did penance for several years, so Shivji could show up and forgive him. But Shivji did no such thing, your honour. Parvati couldn't endure any of this, and she went running to Shivji and said... "Lord, how can you be so cruel?" "Why are you not appearing before your ultimate devotee like Raavan?" "Why don't you forgive him?" Shivji smiled and said... "Parvati, sin has been divided into three categories." "First being when humans commit knowingly or unknowingly," "and can atone for it by apology or various other methods." "Second category is known as atrocities." "Like murder, abduction and other such heinous crimes." "Even they can be forgiven to some extent." "But the third category is known as a great sin." "And there is no forgiveness for it." This is where Parvatiji interrupted Shivji, and asked him in astonishment. "Lord, Raavan abducted Sitaji." "It should be known as an atrocity." "Why do you call it as great sin?" Shivji smiled again and said... Parvati, a sin that affects humanity and spirituality for centuries to come, falls under great sin. "I would have forgiven Raavan," "if he had abducted Sita as Raavan." "But he disguised himself as a sage," "and this shall affect sages and religion for centuries," "And there is no forgiveness for it, your honour." And he is Raavan! Raavan! He shouldn't be pardoned. He has betrayed his profession. He has betrayed innocent children. He has betrayed you, me and Mahadev himself! He used his name to commit a dreadful crime. I claim death penalty, your honour! To be hanged till death! I am sorry, your honour. For raising my voice. That is all, your honour. Looking at how Baba Rahim's supporters showed utter disregard for law and order a special bench of three judges from the high court has decided under suo moto, the judgement in Baba's case will be announced inside Jodhpur Central Jail.
