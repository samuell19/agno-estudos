Woody Davis, age 92 has just changed his address to the sweet by and by. I imagine Woody is playing checkers with St. Peter himself right now, and for those of you who are interested, former Fireside resident William Bartlett, now world-famous architect, has been sighted at Densesky's lunch counter havin' himself a grilled cheese sandwich. [chuckling] Don't burn your chin on that hot cheese, Willie. [laughing] [birds chirping] - Mama's gonna be pleased seein' that we're such a big help. - I can set the table and even make toast. - You are like two big, fluffy sponges just soakin' everything up. - She's gonna be home soon and we'll surprise her with our wealth of knowledge. - Alright, here we go. There you are. - Oh Walt, could you find a different box? That one's just not fittin'. - Well, it's the only one big enough. You want me to mail that cake to Elvis today, it's gonna have to do. - It's not for us? Ain't we havin' it after lunch? - Sugar, I baked that special for the King. Peanut butter, bananas and chocolate. You just stay as sweet as you are and I'll make one for you, too. - I'll tell ya what. After lunch, maybe we'll go into town and get some ice cream. - [Juliet] Yes. [lively music] - Hey Walt. - Oh hey, Norman. Selma, I'd like you to meet my gran-- [stammering] These are James' girls. Ummm. Mouthbreather here is Evangeline A.K.A. Rabbit and the one staring at you real hard like is Juliet, better known as Squirrel. - Well, it is a pleasure to meet you both. Such beauties. Now tell me, Walt, what is it that I can do for you? - I got another package to go to Elvis. - Oh. Well, is it goin' to Graceland just like the last one? - Yes, ma'am. - Is it well packed? - Yes, it's, I packed it all myself. - Oh, okay. - Yes, we're just gonna yeah, drop that off and we're gonna head over to the lunch counter. Come on girls. Come on. Let's go. [chuckling] [playful music] - [Selma] Thank you. Oh, you all right? - Betcha five dollars and an Eskimo pie she's got a lot of boyfriends. - 33. Flavors, not boyfriends and she can list 'em all by heart. Brian, you wanna make that three chocolates, please? Make mine a double. You see, she's got what's called food memory. She can tell you what she had for lunch or dinner, any time, any year. Selma. How 'bout April 15th, 1961. - Tax day. Let's see. I had a tunafish sandwich, a pickle, one, no, two apples and a glass of milk. As a side note, pickles and milk do not go too good together. - What about July 8th 1959. - Lunch or dinner? - Dinner. - Pork chops, two of them, fried, with applesauce, a Waldorf salad, thank you, Brian, ooh and a sweet potato casserole with little nuts on top and those marshmallows. It was to die for. [clapping] - Thank you, Brian. [playful music] There we go. Mmm. - [Ruby] Well? - Well, she said a airmail special delivery should get there sometime tomorrow. Girls, let's get this tea to the table. That smells delicious. - Well, it looks like you two had a good time today. And where is your mustache, mister? Mmm, chocolate fudge. - He had two scoops. - Hey, are you girls settlin' in just fine here? - [Both] Yes, sir. - Well then, don't rat me out to Mamaw. She spent the better part of the afternoon gettin' this meal ready and we need to be grateful, even if we're not that hungry. - Oh, stop. [melancholy music] Alright. [groaning] Let's see. - Get 'em up here. Lord, we thank You for this day of life and for these two girls and their parents. I thank You for my beloved Ruby who spent the day makin' this meal and we ask You to bless this food for the nourishment of our bodies. In Jesus' name, Amen. - [All] Amen.

Man, you keepin' the postal service in business. Look, you, me and the helicopter's gonna win this war. Then we can go home. - Amen to that. Let's go home, Sarge. [helicopter engine zooming] - [Sarge] Hey. - [James] You're in fine hands with Mamaw and Popo. They're saints. I wish I could be there with you. You girls are the brightest spot of my everyday. - Stop swinging so fast, I'm gettin' sick. - Well then, jump off. I wanna finish readin' this. - Will not. He's my daddy, too. - Well, I'll read it if you pipe down. - You girls are the bright spot in my everyday. Are you bein' good for Mamaw? Are you helpin' with the chores? You couldn't-- - [Juliet And James] Be in a better place. There's more love in the Cranbourne house than anywhere else on Earth. You two be good. Keep your eyes on the North Star. Every time I look in the sky I'll think of you. - I'll be home before you know it. Love, your daddy, James Cranbourne. [melancholy music] [chicken clucking] - Just push open the door. There you go, go on in. Don't let 'em out. Now, do you girls know what egg money is? - [Both] No. - We make a little extra for spending on notions and such. Here. I made this special for you. Turn around. There you go. Okay, gimme this basket. Now, come over here and get the eggs. Go around there. Let's go see. [chicken clucking] Take a egg out. Gentle. Bring that over here, hurry girls. - Hi there. You Miss Ruby Cranbourne? - [Ruby] I am. Girls, don't touch this man's car. - That's all right. You were with the Jamboree Sisters, fiddle player. - You'd played the fiddle? - Well, yes I did, but that was a long time ago. - Wow. - Then this is your car, ma'am. - Double wow. - The King says if you are Miss Ruby Cranbourne, fiddle player and cake baker, this Cadillac belongs to you. - [Ruby] The King? - [Man] Yes, ma'am. - Oh yeah, The King. It's a 1959 Coupe de Ville. It's the same make and model he got for his mama. - All right. Y'all have a good day. Let's roll, Bobby. - [Juliet] Mamaw, can we sit in it? [melancholy music] - Oh! Oh!

Here are the necklaces I had made to let you know I am thinking of you. Remember that I love you with all my heart. Mind Ruby and Walt. Do your best in school and don't let the skeeters bite you in the night. Love, Mama. We can wear these to one of Mama's shows in New York. - Is she comin' to get us? - Didn't say. But I'm hopin'. - I'd rather have my mama than this darned old necklace. - Me, too. [coughing] - Oh, are you okay, Mother Cranbourne? - Unable are the loved to die, for love is immortality. - Huh? - Emily Dickinson. Child, you need to know important worldly things like great writers and great literature. - [Evangeline] If you say so. - And never marry any man named George. He will leave you and you will grow to love him and hate him and miss him at the same time. [coughing] - I aim to marry a man named James, like my dad. - Then, good choice. James was the name of a king. And you, Juliet? - I won't marry at all. - Well, then you'll have the potential to fulfill your destiny. What are you burning, Ruby? It stinks to high heaven. I want to cook a turkey for dinner. [playful music] - Girls, you keep an eye on her and do not let her drive and do not let her near my stove. That woman is gonna drive me to drink. And I don't partake. [playful music] - Do we have a baster? [melancholy music] What is that glorious sound? - I think it's Mamaw. - Pardon my sanity in a world insane. Emily Dickinson. You girls really need to learn your literature. [melancholy music] [engine grumbling] [Walt groaning] - What are you two up to? - Mama sent us necklaces. - Oh, that's lovely, just like all the young ladies wear. [violin playing] What's goin' on up there? [snoring] Here ya go. Shh. Oh, hearing your Mamaw play again is like hearing the angels sing. - How'd she learn to sound so good? - Back in the day, she used to play the Grand Old Opry. - You mean, like, on the radio? - Yep. Shh, quiet now. Just listen. [violin music] - The voice of Fireside, KOFF radio coming to you live with 500 watts of power. Hey there stranger. What brings you to the station? You got a heifer to sell? - No, I got nothin' to sell. But I do have a little favor to ask. - [Ruby] What is takin' Popo so long? We have errands to run. - Can we go inside? Please? - Yes, yes, open the door. Walt. [dog barks] - Oh no, Miss Alma, your dog just lit out for the hills. - Little Bit got out? Oh, Lord. Walt you gotta help me find him. My car's dead and that dog is fast. - We'll take the caddy. - Ruby, you start playin' your fiddle right over there-- [talking over each other] But I didn't bring my fid-- - [Walt] Yes, you did. - You're probably the better reader. Hot shot, you flip this red switch whenever Ruby starts playin' and sunshine, if you'll just read those wire feeds if she stops, okay? I don't want any dead air on my station. - Alma, Alma, it's been years since I played with my sisters. I wouldn't know where to start. I can't do-- - I knew that you wouldn't come down here if I told you the truth, so-- - Time's wastin'. Come on, let's find my baby. - Get in the car, get in that car. Just start out with somethin' simple. It'll all come back to ya. Play for me. Keys in the car? - Yes. - [Walt] Play. - Walt! You-- - [Alma] Come on! - [Walt] I'm coming. - [Ruby] Walter Cranbourne. - [Alma] Little Bit! [lively music] - I'm itchin' to hit that red switch. - Doggone it, I have to tune up. Juliet, read whatever's on the papers in front of ya. [violin tuning] - Howdy. Ummm.. This is... Uh, Sunshine Cranbourne talkin'. - Her name ain't sunshine, nothin'. It's Squirrel. She ain't been sunshine any day of her life. [grunting] - Give it! Miss Alma's dog, Little Big, has run off into the streets of Fireside. She's doggone. - Get it? [chuckling] - If you find her, please bring her back to the station. - [Alma] Little Bit! [engine zooming] - [Juliet] Getting engaged? The folks at the Fireside Inn have-- - It's probably better I'm not there, anyway. Just make her nervous. - [Alma] Little Bit! - The lucky bride and groom will be entitled to a special V.I.P. guest treatment, fresh linens on even numbered days and hot sticky cinnamon buns and coffee on odd ones. - Now, here's Fireside's own Ruby Cranbourne and her fancy fiddle to play some of your all-time favorites. [lively violin music] - Wait, wait, wait, is that-- no. It's a rock. - Do you wanna stop snoring? Milton's flesh colored geckos are trained to sit on the nostrils exerting just the right amount of pressure to stop snoring.

We're gonna build sand castles. - Mamaw, she's at it again. - Shh, shh. - Is this normal for old people? - Come with me, Mother Cranbourne. I'll help you. Come on. Sandcastles. - Sandcastles in the beach. [water running] - Ah, I think you'll enjoy this. A nice day at the beach. - Well, thank you dear. How lovely. Before you go, would you mind putting some suntan lotion on me so I don't burn? The sun burns my flesh. [playful music] [chuckling] - [Ruby] What are you doin', Rabbit? - [Evangeline] Life-guardin'.

Oh, go get me a plunger and a mop and a bucket. - [Juliet] Plunger's busted. - What woman in her right mind flushes her underwear down the only toilet in the house? - I don't think she has her right mind, Mama. - Ugh. I should just let Popo clean up his mother's mess. - Good thing we left her nappin'. She's liable to do much worse than clog the toilet. She could burn down-- - Oh, oh, oh, don't even say it. [lively music] Ah, Lord. I look a fright. I don't want anybody to see me like this.

Thank you. - Thank you, Ruby. - Mamaw, why you takin' care of that crazy old woman anyway? - Hey, show some respect. She is your great-grandmother. But, to answer your question, I do it because my conscience won't allow me not to. Like it or not, Itasca is family. - My conscience says I should have a cherry popsicle. - What's a conscience? - It's a little voice inside your head that tells you the difference between right and wrong. - Well, how does it know? - Well, it's just a figure of speech. Now, do you want to know, really know, why I help her? - Yes, ma'am. - No one should be left without somebody to take care of 'em. That is why I am taking care of Mother Cranbourne and you two. I don't think I been doin' a very good job of it lately. - No, Mamaw, you're a blue ribbon. Me and Evangeline are the messes. - Oh no, child. The good Lord does not make messes. You two are perfect and beautiful as mayflowers. - Great grandmama, she was beautiful, wasn't she? - Yes. - Bet you Mama's up in New York singing 'til early mornin'. - I know you girls miss her a lot. - Every day. - Well, I promise you, we are gonna love you through this for better or worse. Lately with Mother Cranbourne, I haven't exactly been at my better. Everything has just been jumpin' up and down on my nerves. - We love you, Mamaw. [melancholy music] Have you ever thought about what you'd do if something happened to Popo? - What on Earth would make you ask such a question? - Havin' no mom and daddy, for one thing. - I do not have an answer for that. I truly don't. - George, is that you? - No, Mother Cranbourne, it's Ruby. Are you okay? - George, the boys need shoes for school. They've outgrown everything and Walt has an earache. He had to go to the doctor. - Mother, everything is gonna be okay. - George, it's been ages since I've seen you. [melancholy music] - Mamaw, why is she always talkin' crazy and talkin' about George? - Oh, she misses him very much. - No, she hates him very much. - Well, she loved him dearly. - She said she wouldn't even swap sandwiches with that man, and that he took a Greyhound Bus across the river into Kingdom Come and left her without a penny. She told me that. - Honey, Kingdom Come is heaven. George died and left her broke and alone to raise your Popo and your Uncle Mel. - All this time, I thought she was just plum mad at him. He couldn't help it, could he? - The human heart doesn't always make good sense. In fact, not a lot of stuff in this world makes good sense. Mop. - Hi. - I've sent notes. I've called, I've left messages. I don't where she is. - Well... Evangeline's a free and independent spirit. Sometimes strangers don't like to come home. [melancholy music] - I am gettin' closer, Walter Cranbourne, and in honor of you and Mother Cranbourne, a little Walt Whitman. Afoot and lighthearted I take on the road. Healthy, free, the world in front of me. [melancholy music] - [Juliet] Ruby used to always say pay attention to what's going on around you in this life, or you're liable to miss something really important. - All right, bedtime girls. - [Evangeline] I don't wanna go to bed. - Oh, what Mamaw says, let's go. [laughing] - Again, again. - You two have to get some sleep. You have school in the mornin' and you have your school pictures. - Popo, will you tuck me in forever? - Cross my heart and hope to die. - Oh, you must never wish for that. - But if I may and if I might, my heart is open for tonight. Though my lips are sealed and a promise is true, I won't break my word, my word to you. - [Walt] That's real nice. - [Ruby] Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep. - [Walt] Get in there snug as a bug. [melancholy music] - [Juliet] Goodnight. - [Evangeline] Goodnight. [chattering] [bell ringing] - [Walt] Hey, Selma. - How you doin, Walt? Girls. - Girls, you get, grab a seat there.

He didn't lose consciousness and he never, he never moaned or complained about the pain. - He never complained about anything. - Says here, the only sound they heard was gunfire, and helicopters blades whirring like 1,000 birds' wings. - He always loved birds, even crows. - And that night he uh, after helpin' this soldier and others who were wounded, he, he died.

Welcome back to the Fireside Poetry Hour. I was readin' Emily Dickinson in honor of our beloved Ruby, who passed away and is dearly missed. Because I could not stop for death, he kindly stopped for me. The carriage held but just ourselves in immortality. - [Both] We slowly drove, he knew no haste, - [Juliet] And I put away my labor and my leisure, too-- - Ruby. - [Juliet] With his civility. - I miss Popo. - I know honey, I do too. - [Both girls] One, two, three. [thunder booming] - Ooh, sounds like the good Lord and his bowling league are at it again. I don't know how Mother Cranbourne is sleeping through this. Juliet, go check on her, will you please? [lightning cracking] [thunder booming] Uh oh. No electricity means no phone. [melancholy music] Mother Cranbourne. Girls, leave the room. Your great-grandmother has passed. I better call the Sheriff. - Mamaw, you just said the phone ain't workin'. - Oh, cheese and crackers. - Don't worry Mamaw. I'll vouch for you. You didn't do anything. You were with us the whole day. - Oh. - [Evangeline] What's gonna happen to her? - She's gonna be with her George. - And our daddy? - And your daddy. All right, come on girls. Gotta go. Gotta go get the sheriff, let's go. Go on. [melancholy music] [wipers squeaking] [thunder booming] I cannot think of a worse time for Walt to be gone. There oughta be an 11th commandment. Thy shalt not leave thy dyin' mother with her daughter-in-law. - Mamaw, isn't there a commandment about not stealing your neighbor's husband? - Excuse me? - Mamaw, Popo ain't home 'cause he's probably with that Selma woman. - What are you talking about? - We saw 'em together the other night, when we were at Dixie's. They was kissin' all over one another on the porch. - [Juliet] Evangeline! - If you ever say such a thing again, I will tan your hides. [thunder booming] - [Juliet] She's sorry. Ain't ya? - Sorry. - I should say so. - [Juliet] Maybe while we're here, we can do a missing persons report for Popo. - [Evangeline] Or mostly if he's with Miss Selma Davis. [laughing] - The customer came right back in with that [mumbling] on. [suspenseful music] - [Juliet] See what you've done? Now we're gonna have to get sent to an orphanage home thanks to you. - He has not been with that woman. He will be home any minute. He probably just missed his flight. - [Evangeline] Missed it goin' and comin'. - Who took the sweetness outta you two? - [Juliet] Don't worry, Mamaw. If Popo doesn't come back, you'll find yourself a new husband. [gasping] [screaming] - [Evangeline] You killed her! - Mamaw! - [Norman] That's Ruby! - [Juliet] Mamaw! Help! - [Evangeline] Somebody! [dramatic music] Help! - [Norman] Ruby. - [Selma] Girls, what happened? - [Evangeline] She fell and busted her head. - Mamaw! - [Selma] Honey, you've gotta take her to the hospital right now. - [Norman] I got you, Ruby girl. - [Evangeline] What's gonna happen to her? - [Norman] Get around here guys, give me a hand. - [Evangeline] Is she okay? - Mamaw! - You're a good man, Norman. I'ma take the girls and go and find Walt. - [Norman] All right, you be careful, honey. [dramatic music] [wipers squeaking] - Are you two-timing on my Mamaw? [chuckling] - Are you runnin' a fever, sugar britches? Who's been feedin' you all that gobbledygook? - We saw you from Dixie's window. You and Popo was kissin'. That's why we rolled your yard. - Girls, the man you saw me with, that's Mr. Densesky. Norman and I have been together over a year now. In fact, we're engaged to be engaged, whatever that means. Oh. - Careful. We already have one of us dead. - Girls, your grandma, she's gonna be just fine. She bumped her head real hard, but she'll bounce back. - I ain't talkin' 'bout Mamaw. Talking 'bout Mother Cranbourne. She up and died on us. - Yeah, she croaked. - That's why we were on our way to the sheriff's office. [engine zooming] - [Walt] Selma. - [Evangeline] Popo. - Where's Ruby? Nurse says that she's resting comfortably, but they're gonna keep her overnight for observation. - Oh, thank God. Walt, I'm sorry about your mama. - Oh, yeah well. We did all we could. She's uh... She looks real peaceful. The coroner and the sheriff, they're on the way here, but I really need to get over to the hospital. I gotta visit my Ruby. - Well, I'll stay. - [Walt] Thank you. - Did you find Marguerite? - Oh well. You know, we're at the airport and darndest thing, she set her bags down and then she just ran off. I went to the city. I sat outside her apartment, better part of 24 hours and she never showed up. - [Selma] How could she do that to those sweet girls? - Oh, darned if I know. [stammering] I told her James had been killed and she cried for a spell, which I expected. Then I told her that Juliet and Evangeline, they were doin' real good, but they, they'd sure be a lot better off if they had their mama. She acted right ashamed. I thought she would do the right thing, and then, [stammering] I just guess she couldn't. [melancholy music] - Those poor girls. You want me to make another special package to send from Marguerite? - Oh. Oh, I'd so appreciate that. These girls have been through so much. Last thing they need to hear is that their mama don't want 'em. Thank you. Squirrel, how long you been standin' here? Where's Rabbit? We will not speak a word this, do you understand? It'd only break her heart. It's gonna be our secret. Oh my, it's been a whopper of a day. Rabbit, come on, let's put a move on. Let's put our smiles on and get down to the hospital and pay your Mamaw a visit. [melancholy music] [church bell tolling] [gentle organ music] - She crossed the river, all right. - Someone turned on her light switch right before she died. - I think I'm gonna miss her. - Well, she is with her George. - Selma, I'm sorry we toilet papered your yard. We were wrong. - Was fun, though. I'm sorry. - Considering the confusion around Norman and me, apology accepted. After all, forgiveness and the Lord's house go hand in hand. - She looks beautiful, Selma. - Scotch tape can do miraculous wonders for crow's feet. - Is there anything you can't do? - I can't take care of a demanding mother-in-law with dementia, raise two girls, play the fiddle, grow prize tomatoes and heaven knows what else. I'm proud to have you as a friend, Ruby Cranbourne. [gentle organ music] - Hi. - [Juliet] Hi. Is it okay if I sit here, with you? - Sure, I'd like that. - I'm sorry about your great-grandma. Juliet, I want you to know that you mean the world to me. You're a very special girl. - I hate beets. [engine zooming] - [Juliet] Ruby's love for me and Evangeline was steadfast, and I wish I could say the same about me and my sister. - What? What, true confessions on the radio? - [Juliet] She blames me for so much of what went wrong in our past. - Juliet Cranbourne, you will not do this to me in public. - [Juliet] And, well it all came to a head. It was a horrific, knock-down, drag-out, full-blown argument. That's when we last spoke. Walt and Ruby were the salt of the earth and they had a marriage that had been tested and polished to a sheen. I mean, we were not your typical family. We were an eccentric great-grandmother who danced into her final days and two difficult, challenging girls who had been orphaned twice and we fought a lot. But this, this the biggest [yelling] fight we've ever had. We haven't spoken in a very long time. - [Evangeline] Believe me, you're gonna be hearing from me real soon. - [Juliet] I need to ask y'all to please send Evangeline a note tellin' her to come home. Imagine 5,000 notes all from Fireside. What in blue blazes? - You're bein' pre-empted. - Good to see you, too. - Nuh uh, do not give me that. I am not the guilty party here. Now tell me, what is going on with Walt? - I tried to tell you, [mellow music] but you wouldn't pick up your phone. - Well, I have been drivin' for three days to get here. - There's this thing called an airplane. - Flyin' throws my inner clock's timin' off. You know that. - Well, you shoulda called. - You should have called. - I did! I promise and hope my eyeballs fall out if I'm lyin'. - Yeah well, your track record isn't so good. - Oh, I never lied to you. - You did, too. - I did not. - My entire life. - I Just, withheld some information. - Yes. Withheld. Tell me what is goin' on with Popo? - Why don't you come home and find out? Well, he has his good days and bad. - Well, look who's returned from the dead. - Probably not the best choice of words, Dixie. - It's been years since I've seen you, Evangeline. You still wearing them pink bloomers? - Dixie's been a godsend. She's Walt's hospice nurse. - Thought I'd finally get myself a legit career. Didn't know I'd end up likin' it. Come on. [melancholy music] - How is he today? - [Dixie] He's restin' okay. He hasn't eaten much today, though. Walt, you got company. Walt? [melancholy music] - Awww. Hey. Ah, it's good to see you, Rabbit. [weeping] - Popo, I am sorry that I been gone for so long. - Shh. - Does it hurt? - Hurtin's all I got since I lost Ruby. - God, I missed you. - I'm glad you're here. I uh... There's somethin' that I need you to do together. - Are there snakes? - No, just a bunch of old, old stuff. [melancholy music] - [Evangeline] I don't know how you can stand it. This place is full of sad memories. - [Juliet] Well, if you lived here, you'd understand. - Well, I don't and I don't. - Well, this is your home, too. - Not any more. - Well. Found this. - You know I will never forgive you for having hidden somethin' so important from me for so many years. - I know, it was a mistake. - Oh, well your mistake has screwed up my life. If I'd known the truth, I could have just dealt with it and moved on. - I was tryin' to protect you. I did what I thought was right. - Yeah, well you were dead wrong. - [Juliet] Get over it, Rabbit. Move on. - [Evangeline] What, I can't even talk to you. [chuckling] - Those two always did fight like cats and dogs, didn't they? - Yeah, but they'll work it out. They always do. [melancholy music] - [Juliet] I'm... - It was all a farce. A game just played with my mind. - It was done outta love. You miss her. - God, you know, there is this great big hole inside where... Something I can't really recall used to be. But you know, if I would have known the truth, I could have dealt with it. If I would have known what happened with Mama and Walt in New York, I could have just dealt with it and I would be over this by now. - I knew and I'm not over it. There's just some things you don't ever get over. But you choose to move on. - I... I was never thinkin' of comin' home. [melancholy music] But I had to 'cause of Walt. Walt. - [Juliet] I'm glad you did. - Walt. - You know how bad he's been wantin' us to get up here and do this whatever it is we're doin'? - Scavenger hunt. - Yep. Well, look at there. Last thing on his list, right here. - Oh yeah. I haven't seen these things in years. They may not be worth much, but to me, they're everything. [melancholy music] You don't open that, you... I want you to stick in the glove box of the caddy. Save it for another day. Hey, Squirrel, you wanna get that package wrapped behind you? Now, what's that postmark say? - It says September, 1967. - They said they lost it, imagine that. Misplaced for over 30 years. They said it dropped down behind the counter then they built a wall around it. It showed up here just after I lost Ruby. Had it almost a year now, but... I couldn't bring myself to open it up. Help yourself. [melancholy music] - [James] May 30th, 1967. Dear Juliet and Evangeline, you girls get this, that means I've gone on ahead. Help your grandparents as much as possible, but have fun, too, and most of all, don't fight. - I don't know what to say about your mother bein' gone. She has broken all of our hearts. For your own sake's, forgive her and move on. You've got to forgive people before you can get over the hurt. Remember that and when you get to heaven, I'll build a house with a porch swing. Don't try to get there early. There's plenty of time. Most important of all, remember I love you both. Always, Daddy. Ohh! - [Evangeline] Wow. - That's Ruby's work. - She's still here with us. - What's she tryin' to say? - I think she wants you two to get along. Forgive your mother. Forgive me. But most of all, forgive each other. - You mean, she can hear what I been saying about Juliet all these years? [laughing] Cheese and crackers. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I never meant to hide the truth from you. - You were easy to blame. - What we did, what was done, was outta love, nothin' more. - Welcome home, little sister. [melancholy music] The Rabbit came home. One of the biggest myths of the town of Fireside is Ruby's 1959 pink Cadillac. Some say that Elvis gave it to her, but others, they say it was all Walt's idea. [melancholy music] - One bill of sale for one gently used 1959 Cadillac Coupe de Ville to a very sneaky Mr. Walter Cranbourne. [laughing] - This family, it's full of secrets! Whenever I get into a little bit of a, a situation, I just ask myself, what's the course of my life? What's the most important thing? What's my North Star? And I guess I'd have to say truth and love. My North Star continues to guide me in life, by its light and what I learned from Walt and Ruby. - [All] To Walt and Ruby. - [Juliet] I know they are surely dancin' in heaven. And someday, I'll join them, too, but first, I have a date with William Bartlett.
