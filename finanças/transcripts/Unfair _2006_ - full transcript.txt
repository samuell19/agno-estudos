Sato Kazuo did it. There's no mistake. Your ex-husband can't always control himself, Yukihira-san? He's not a killer. Coming from a family member? Who are you? Why? I can't let you to arrest me now, step aside! It was Sato Kazuo. The one who wanted to kill Hasumi was your husband? Is he the murderer of the X-mark serial murders? Hasumi admitted it. She told me about a website. Who is really unfair? That message is from here? This website is to punish those unfair people. And being designated for revenge, Officer X. I know the webmaster's name. It?s Sato Kazuo, prepare to arrest him! Don't tell Mom that Dad came here. Everyone...betrayed me. I love you. Can't l? At the place where my dad passed away, I want to meet with you alone. Dad, please give me courage and power. You don't know anything! (One day earlier) Although it's a day before the anniversary, I just wanted to come. Kazuo is a suspect. Yukihira, you have to bless Natsumi-chan. These past few days, the serial murders have continued. The former Daily News editor, Sato Kazuo, has become the suspect. Such an announcement... What if Sato Kazuo isn't the criminal? As the Chief Officer, you are a coward. Don't worry, Sato Kazuo is definitely the criminal. Haste makes waste. Aren?t you... Inspector Ando? You're always together with Inspector Yukihira. I am Imai from Daily News. Any news about Editor Sato? I should be asking that. Shouldn?t you know where he is? The next news. Police hope that everyone will give a helping hand. Give any information on the serial murders relating to the suspect, Sato Kazuo. Any witness, information, or other clues. You can contact the investigation department in the Shinjuku headquarters. Note the contact information as it appears on screen. Suspect Sato has killed a few... (Together forever.) Together forever... Mio, just a sec. (I want to meet with you. At which church should I wait for you?) (Kazuo) Church? They suspect you. I know, that?s why I?m looking for you. I can't take any actions. You came here to confess? What are you talking about? I?m not the criminal. Truly. If that's true, then why... ...didn't you contact me? Why did you run away from Hasumi's hospital room? Your colleague, Hasumi Anna was the kidnapper. I can't trust the police anymore. I'm done for if I get caught. No matter what happens, they will treat me as the criminal. I wanted to work with my own hands to investigate this case. I have found out the truth. I still can't trust the police. But... I trust you. So I called you. Will you look at that laptop? What's this? The emails Hasumi sent me. "Sato Kazuo-sama, I have something to discuss with you. Please come to room 752 in the police hospital alone. Although security is tight, You can find your own way to come in. Hasumi Anna." It couldn't be Hasumi. I didn't know her situation at that time. So I went to the hospital. Hasumi-san? Hasumi-san, I am Sato Kazuo. I concluded that she couldn't speak well. But, she finally talked. B...atsu... X... - Who are you? - I can't let you arrest me now, step aside! That website had an X (batsu). Sezaki, Makimura-san, and Hasumi met there before. Close the email screen. (Who is really unfair?) We got the same website too. Then, the webmaster of this website... is you? - What are you talking about? - Don't pretend. I checked the records. Three years ago, you set this website up. What's the motive? To take revenge on me? Do you hate me that much? Correct. The real criminal's motive is... to take revenge on you, Natsumi. I have thought of some other possibilities. The motive connecting these three cases. Listen, Natsumi. You're on your own. From this point of view, you can easily understand this complicated case. Sezaki, Makimura, Hasumi. Clear those three criminals completely, and think about their motives. First, the detective novel case from Sezaki. It was the beginning of this continual revenge. It's a bookmark? Who is really unfair? Sezaki was using the happy way to complete his revenge. The detective novel What do you think this means? Believing that this unfair person will be a normal person. Your best friend, Matsumoto Rieko, was killed. The sign warning the victims? - A loved person. - A loved person? For Sezaki, there was no benefit in killing Rieko. Just to make you sad. There is evidence of the secret person working from behind. The "loved person" means a "loved person" of yours. Sezaki! You were forced to kill Sezaki. That case from five years ago, when you shot Saitou Yutaka, was brought back. Your reputation was gone. If something like that happens again, will you shoot the criminal? Of course, I won't hesitate. You were ensnared by the hidden person's trap. Announcing the same comment from five years ago-- Of course, I won't hesitate. --after your reputation was gone. Then started a ransom, with the public donating. I am disappointed in you. I can't imagine that you won?t accept donations for your daughter. Your pride was stirred up, but you still lowered your head to the criminal. Please stop. Don't kill Mio. Please... Please! Maybe I didn't think objectively, but through Mio's kidnapping, our relationship became closer. That must have been what the secret person was aiming for. What do you mean? To build trust in our relationship, and then destroy all of it again. To let you fall into pain. So the secret person purposely made the serial murder case, wanted to designate me as the criminal. And then this X website, connects with Sezaki, Makimura, and Hasumi. The only evidence is the website's owner, and my name was used. The conclusion is to make others think that I am this secret person. Natsumi, trust me. I am not the criminal. Trust me. I... Believed in Hasumi before. Then, I was betrayed. Do you... Do you intend to betray me too? Natsumi! That's what the criminal wants. You think I can do such things, to make Mio feel sad? Then where is this real secret person? You mean that there is another person who owns this website. That's right. The secret person's aim is to snatch away Yukihira Natsumi's, loved and trusted ones. Then, this time, he or she wants you to shoot me as the criminal. Just like Sezaki. The criminal will surely watch this interesting scene. This is the plan he designed. The ending at last. He won't miss out on such a moment, don't you think? You being tortured like this is really disappointing. That secret person will surely come to watch. To confirm his own result? Right. For me, I will do that. Natsumi. Shoot me. After you shoot me, the first person who appears will be the secret person. What if nobody comes out? Then you just arrest me. Treat me as the secret person. First, send an email to the owner of the X website. The name of the owner hides a link. If this secret person has a perfect plan, that email will be forwarded to me. In other words, that email will be received by me and that secret person. At the place where my dad passed away, I want to meet you alone. --Yukihira Yasumoto, can you tell me the truth? What actually happened? Don't pretend anymore; it's troublesome for us. Mio-chan. Mio-chan. The person with the big ears is me? I don't have such big ears. Mio-chan. Mio-chan, Big Brother will eat those ears! Aaaah! Mio-chan, did you just talk? You talked! Mio-chan. Great, that?s great, Mio-chan. You are that site's webmaster. You don't know anything! Natsumi, shoot me. After you shoot me, the first person who appears will be the secret person. In this world, there is no such thing as fair. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. The answer to unfair is UNFAIR Ep. 11 --Final-- Raw provided by gryzze Timings by tianj Translation by SSJSubgeta Quality Check by Saragorn Yukihira. It's you, Ando? You killed him? Why are you here? Because Yasumoto said that today was your dad's death anniversary. - We need to call an ambulance... - You are the webmaster? - What are you talking about? - Sezaki. Makimura. Hasumi. You're the person who connects them. Yukihira-san, what are you talking about? What was your motive? Hurry up! Is it OK to not call an ambulance? - Answer me, Ando! - Ambulance-- There's no need. It's too bad... I'm still alive. You... Are you the X webmaster? Really? As I thought, Yukihira is amazing. I surrender. Using Hasumi's name to ask Sato to come to the ward... That was you? Right. I sent that email. And the X-mark serial murders? Yes. - You're the person who wrung Hasumi's neck? - Yes. You shot Makimura? It was me. I had done a lot of things on that day. My bullet wound cracked open again. You killed Makimura-san after you used her? Used? Wrong, I just assisted. Actually, the X website was set up for those people who wanted to take revenge. I just provided some instructions for the people that gather there. You're bullshitting. They decided on their own. When you came to my house for the first time, you wanted to kill me? Yeah, it's just like what you think. Who are you? It?s me, Ando. Why? Is it because of the shooting five years ago? When Yukihira shot Saitou Yutaka? That person who shot the all the staff of the pachinko parlor and used the shopkeeper as hostage... That evil murderer... - Ando! - You're lucky you're wearing a bullet-proof vest. Next time I will definitely shoot your head. I'm good at shooting; I trained hard for today. I think I'm better than Yukihira-san. Yukihira-san, you shot Saitou Yutaka. Do you know who he was? - Do you know? - 17 years old. Stayed at the pachinko parlor. After he killed five staff employees, he held the shopkeeper hostage. The murderer was seriously injured. What's the relationship between you and Saitou Yutaka? Orphanage? Right. He and I are the kids who were left in the Shinjuku coin locker. We were like brothers. He was a nice person. Yutaka! Why did you leave the meat? Don't just choose what food to eat! - Let him go! - You're troublesome. I hate killing animals and eating them. What are you talking about? - Stop! - You, too! How should I tell you so that you can understand? Brother. He killed five people. You call that nice? Yukihira-san, you don't understand. Welcome back. Still not asleep? Here. Thanks. You know, you're really smart. Go to college. Here. It?s not too late. I will work harder for you. Hey, do you know who we are? We gave you a job since you don't have a good background. You should be thankful. Please, at least pay Yutaka's salary. Salary? You must be joking. - Isn?t that what you promised? - Shut up! Don't hit his face. The orphanage is very troublesome. - Please... - Brother Ando. What's the problem, Yutaka? What's your opinion? Didn't you promise you wouldn't beat Yutaka? What are you talking about? Since when do you order me around? Yukihira-san. Yukihira-san, have you forgotten? That day. That day you shot Yutaka, I was there. Don't come here! - Don't come here! - Yutaka! What are you doing? Yukihira, you shot Yutaka, who killed people because he wanted to help me. He wanted to rescue me from that type of life, and did it that way. Since that day, my life has totally changed. In these five years, I stayed alive to get revenge from you. Every day... Just thinking about you matters. I wanted you to taste it, the pain of losing someone important in your life. But... It's over. Go to hell. For Yutaka's sake... Go to hell, for Yutaka's sake. OK. Natsumi! If this will set you free, just shoot. Mio! Mio-chan. Did you get tired of waiting in the car? (Are you crying?) Me? I?m not crying. Brother needs to go first. I still haven't finished some work. Mio-chan, you take care, OK? It?s OK to have courage. Go to your kind mother and father. Mio... I'll leave Mio with you. Let me borrow your car. Mio... What is it? I know who the serial murderer is. Who is it? Ando. Ando? Really? I'm not wrong, he admitted it. Admitted? We'll talk about the details later. He is driving a car with plate numbers PC-21-0. He's moving towards the Kotou area. What is it? We know who the criminal is. Ando Kazuyuki, 23 years old. Ando? He is now driving towards the Kotou area. - Go immediately, prepare emergency equipment! - Yes, sir! Trace the location of a car with plate numbers PC-21-0. Block the roadway. Ando... Emergency call. Announcement from the police station to every station: The targeted car is moving onto 357th, moving westward. Repeat: The targeted car is moving onto 357th... This is lwa from Kotou. The suspect is now driving along Wangan road. He's heading towards Yokohama. Trace the current position of PC-21-0. Announcement from police station to other stations: The target, PC-21-0, has been spotted along Wangan road, moving toward Yokohama. - Yokohama? - Continue tracing. Yes, sir. We have lost the position of PC-21-0. He switched off the signal. Yukihira. - Where are you? - Wangan road. We have information that he's running to Yokohama. You go chase after him. Yokohama? Brother needs to go. I still haven't finished some work. The information is correct? Ando should be going to the place where Saitou Yutaka was shot. I?m in charge here. Yukihira, don't act alone! Yukihira, go. I?ll allow you to act alone. Roger. - Where is the shopkeeper? - In his office, third floor. Brother Ando. Who are you? Ando Kazuyuki from the investigation department. I came to punish you. Do you remember me? Kazu, who was always together with Yutaka. You can't do anything. Kazu? Help me! Don't kill me! Please... - Please! - Ando! Yukihira-san. I won't let you kill people before my own eyes. Even you. Yukihira! Don?t get involved. Yukihira. Ando. Ando! Ando. ANDO! You're such a dumbass. You're such a dumbass! This is Ando's room. Wow... I looked into how Ando did in the police academy. He was the top of his class in everything. If he stopped his revenge, and continued like that, he could have been promoted as an inspector. Wouldn't that be easier than revenge? Yukihira. Yutaka and I were left behind in the coin locker in Shinjuku. Let's go. Mom is waiting. Is it over? Not yet. Really? Mio, after Mom finishes work, want to go to the playground? (With Ando?) Mio. Ando...went to another station. This is for Mio, from Ando. Courage. It's OK to have courage. Ma...ma. l....love...you. Thanks for watching. Hope you enjoyed it as much as Saragorn and I enjoyed working on it. Coming soon... Unfair SP - Code Breaking! Look forward to it! The detective novel case, Mio-chan's kidnapping, and the X-mark serial murders. To take responsibility for those three unlucky cases, Chief Yamagi has resigned. They solved all the cases. Kill... Kill...me. Nope. Stay alive to atone for your crime. I will always be near you. About the roadside accident of Hirota Hirujio... The internal information has been corrupted. Ask Sato Kazuo to write it out. - Is this OK? - Yes. But... Don't tell anyone who your informant is. We will miss you. Thanks for your care. We'll walk you-- No need, here will be fine. Take care. I haven't heard your reply. My era is coming. I told you, didn't I. I'm quite old already. It?s pointless to participate in the fight in your department. This is from Ando. I will enjoy the computer game after I retire. What are you thinking? It's over. You're right. Kaoru, you don't want to drink milk? I want to drink a cup today. Cheers. I wonder if Ando's revenge was not successful in the end. Why's that? Sato Kazuo didn't shoot me. The shopkeeper of the pachinko parlor is still alive. What? Although you have a great sense in solving cases, when it comes to your own matters... Forget it, it's just like you. Aaah, Yukihira-san. When you see this video, I think I won't be around anymore. I hope to die by your hand. You also know that I always can't control myself. If I die by a different method, I will regret it. But I have no idea about that. I will treat it as my punishment. Five years ago, you killed Yutaka. My revenge on you is everything to me. I really just have one way to go. Every day seems like hell. That such a sweet person like Yutaka was shot while the shopkeeper is still alive is very unfair. I can't bear it. What I should do to effectively take revenge on you? I think about this every day. To approach a person like you who is number one in solving cases, I worked hard. I worked so hard. But... Just relying on my revenge to keep me alive... tires me. I can't understand. I have lost Yutaka. The site members are friends and partners. They're family. Though they don't know me... And, Yukihira-san... I... Maybe you won't believe it now... I really loved you. This feeling is not a lie. It was my mistake. But... I'm really glad you were the target of my revenge. Go alone. The matters that were decided on that day, I won't regret. There are some sad moments. Though I?m still in love, I won't hesitate if the future is still full with light of hope. We will surely meet again Become stronger to stay alive. Every day loving people. The moment of being loved. That temperature won't disappear. - The answer to unfair I can't say anything to you. - is unfair. No matter what the language is, I want to tell you everything. I think that you can't see the night. In a room surrounded by insomnia, - Ando! I still believe in love. Once again, -You're such a dumbass! I won't give up. I will believe in you. Faith in my future... In this world, there is no such thing as fair. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. The answer to unfair is... UNFAIR.
