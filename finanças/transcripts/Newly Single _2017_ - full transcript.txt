I do, I love women. Yeah, it'’s like you'’re idealizing women. Well, I kissed one once, but that was it. I saw your movie. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Adaline and Emily?-Mm-hm. We just met, so that means a lot to me. Hm. Yeah. It was different than I thought it was going to be. Like, different having had met me before, or... Yeah. I think so. OK. Did I tell you that I used to date a movie producer? No. Has he, uh, made anything I'’ve seen, or...? Uh, he made an indie movie that was like very character-driven, kind of like what you'’re going for. Oh, well, I'’ve probably seen it then. What... what was it called? Medicine for Melancholy. I don'’t know. It sounds familiar. I don'’t think I'’ve seen it though. Maybe it sounds familiar just because of how the title is, or... How well did it do? I don'’t know. Well, I mean, is it worth my time? Should I see it? I can'’t say that. That'’s up to you. Oh, come on. Don'’t be coy. I know it'’s not probably as good as my film, but it'’s not easy to make a movie. Come on, you can tell me, on just, like, a personal level, which one you liked more. Um... I guess I liked Medicine for Melancholy. What? You can'’t say that. It'’s just an opinion. It doesn'’t matter. You'’re right. I'm sorry. I didn'’t think that would affect me so much. I'’m going to go. No, don'’t go. - Why? - I'’m sorry. There... There'’s no recovering from that. No, there is. Sit back down. Sit... c'’mon on I'm sorry. I said I was sorry. Now you say you'’re sorry. What'’s your... I do, it'’s probably... Hi, I'’m Astor. Hi. Um, this is David. He'’s visiting from New York. We went to college together. - And Cheryl. - We went to high school together. Hi. Hello. This is Astor. - This is his first Tinder date. - Ah, it is. She has, like, a hundred thousand followers. I could text her right now if you asked. So you'’re a production designer? - I am. - She'’s the best. That'’s what I hear. I like your outfit. Oh, thank you. You actually look better in person than you do in your pictures. I think you should get new pictures. Oh, thanks. My mom said it'’s always best to under advertise. That way you always exceed expectations. - Are your parents still together? - They are. That'’s good, I like that. - Hey, so Tammy Thompson? OK? - Uh-huh. - Born again. Married at 19. - Right. - Divorced last year. - Yeah, yeah, Tammy, of course. - She'’s, like, an escort in Vegas now. - Yes. Boobs out. She'’s like slutting it up all over the place. - She'’s in Vegas? - So what do you guys think about feminism? Yes, she'’s going crazy right now. Wait, I don'’t understand, but she... When did she break up with her husband? - Are you a feminist? - Mike? - Are you a feminist? - No, she'’s not a prostitute. - It'’s different than that. - Are you a feminist? I like this guy! He'’s, like, not a man's man. He'’s like a sensitive guy I can tell that. - I like him. - Honestly. - I like your shirt. - Invite him, invite him. - Yeah? - Yeah. OK, so, David'’s in town from New York '’cause he's directing this play, um, that premieres next Thursday. - You should come. - OK. Thank... thanks for the invite. - So, you'’re a feminist? - Oh, no. I don'’t believe in feminism. No, really, I don'’t. I think if you thought about it, you wouldn'’t either. No, I'’m a feminist. I went to Vassar for Christ sake. Well, but you don'’t wanna work though. - Of course I do. - No, you don'’t. Ooh... I don'’t? I mean, don'’t get me wrong, I'’m... I'm... I'’m pro-women and I think anybody should be able to do anything they want, regardless of gender. All I'’m saying is, we are animal beings who have developed over millions of years of evolution and during this whole period, of millions of years, men have done this one very specific thing, and women have done this other thing. And then come 1967, that all changes? Forever? Is that gonna last? Because, evolutionarily speaking, it'’s just been a blip. - Hello? - Hey... Hey, Mom. Hey, honey. It'’s late. Is everything all right? Yeah, I'’m sorry, are you still up? - Is it OK? -It'’s OK. What'’s up? Did you find a job? I told you, I'’m not looking for a job. Oh, how can you say that? Because I'’m not interested in what the world is offering me right now. You know how difficult it is for somebody like me? I'’m not gonna take some soulless job on some daytime talk show. I'’m hedging my bet. What does that mean? It means I'’m better, than what things have to offer me right now. OK, well... how'’s the movie going? I'’m making a new movie. It'’s... It stars Taylor... Touring. Who'’s that? Oh, my God. I can'’t even believe I'’m from you two. Well, what does Valerie think? I haven'’t told Valerie, we'’re taking a break. It'’s none of her business, but... if she knew, she'’d agree. How long have you been taking a break for? I went on a date tonight. Mmkay, how was that? Well... she'’s a production designer and her ex-boyfriend'’s Quentin Tarantino, so there'’s that. Oh, she talked about her ex-boyfriend? No, Mom, she didn'’t talk about her ex-boyfriend, I googled her, that'’s what people do now. I gotta go. Oh, all right. Well, I love you. I love you, too. Uh, you guys wanna start with 17? Is that all right? OK. Um, we can just pretend this uh... We'’ll pretend this, uh, sofa is that dumpster you guys are sitting up against, and, um ... I guess, Taylor if you wanna start standing and walk into it? If that works for you? - Mm-hm. - OK. Um, so, again, I know we talked about this, both, one-on-one, but what'’s important is just to hit the major emotional beats. So, if there'’s anything that doesn'’t seem like the way you would say it, or, it just isn'’t working for you, feel free to put it in your own words. It'’s completely fine, OK? - You good? - Mm-hm. All right, and action. Hey, hey, hey, hey... Sit down. C'’mon, sit. Hey, everything'’s going to be OK. OK? Look at me. Look. We'’re gonna call the police, all right? And we'’re gonna get your money back. E... everything'’s gonna work out. Are you fucking kidding me? The police? You wanna call the fucking police?! Do you think that the police actually care about this? We'’re just a bunch of kids! Are you serious?! Look at me. Uh, I didn'’t think you'd, uh, really like me. I lied about everything. That money is everything. I have nothing, OK? And... I love you. All right! Thanks. That was great. Great, that was great. On this next one, let'’s just do one thing a little bit different. What'’s this script? "I Am Jeffrey... Deetch"? Ah, it'’s "Deitch." It'’s just this sci-fi thing I wrote. Have you, uh, heard of "Refrigerator Play"? What'’s that? It'’s where I lock you in my refrigerator and only let you out to perform volatile sexual acts you'’d otherwise be too embarrassed to perform. Izzy? What'’s the matter? Nothing. I'’m OK. All right. I just don'’t want you to think that just because we met, you know, tonight, that you can'’t tell me stuff. I think it'’s best, just to get everything out, at the beginning, you know? Everybody'’s got baggage. You'’re right, but I'm OK. All right. How long you been single? Like a month? That'’s not very long. Yeah. It sucks. Was he a Korean guy? No. I kind of only date white guys. Oh. What'’d he do? He was a lawyer. Is that who you were thinking about a second ago? Yeah. What went wrong? I just got bored. Like, in what way? Like, in all the ways? We dated for five years and we hardly ever had sex, but he kept saying that it was going to get better but... I didn'’t know, I... I kind of come from this world that'’s sort of backwards in a lot of ways. And so... I don'’t know. I didn'’t realize it wasn'’t normal. Is that important to you, to have a lot of sex? Yeah. I'’m kind of a pervert. Yeah? You think I'’m a pervert? Maybe. I should go. I have to work early. Ah! Valerie. I'’m sorry and I love you. Are you drunk? Uh... no. I don'’t know why you left. Please come home. You know why. No, I don'’t. I love you. I'’m sorry. I'’ll call you back soon. No! Hi, you'’ve reached Valerie. Leave, uh-- You were always a rebound! Oh, fuck it. Are you, or are you not back? Yeah, we just landed. How'’d it go? It was incredible! We won the festival! You didn'’t hear? No! Oh, my God, that'’s amazing! Congratulations! Dude, thank you. Um, listen. I'’m calling you because I got your message. No problem with Taylor. I'’ll make some calls tomorrow, we'’ll get some more money. Just put this out of your mind, it'’s a done, I promise. Oh, my God, are you serious?! With her? Yeah, slam dunk. Oh... thank you, that is so great!

You'’re not like the rest of them. - Hey. - Hey. Good morning. What time is it? Oh, it'’s like 6:22, sorry. I have a call with China at 6:30. Um, OK. Thanks, sorry. Hey. Sorry, I just gotta make that call, it'’s in like two minutes. That'’s OK, um, do you wanna do something later today? Yeah, maybe. It depends on the call. If I can, I'’ll text you, OK? OK. Hello? Hey, are you all right? What'’s this number? Are you all right? No, I'’m not all right. What'’s this number? It doesn'’t matter. C'’mon. Come home. Hey, you'’re gonna be all right, OK? I'’m not. "Migrants in Europe face a new danger in coming winter." What? "The migrants coming into Europe through the western Balkans, in recent months, have been resourceful and adaptable enough to slip through unfriendly police officers, raging rivers, hostile borders and razor-wire fences. But there is one thing they cannot evade, and that is the looming winter." Winter is no time to be alone, Valerie. You need me. We need each other. I'’m just calling to tell you I'’m coming by Thursday to get my things. What? No, you can'’t. Well, Jesus, Astor, you'’ve left me no choice. That'’s not true. It is. Just don'’t do it. It'’s that simple. Have you been with anyone since I left? No. Have you? No. I'’ll be there at ten. No, you won'’t. I'’d appreciate it if you weren'’t there. OK? Things don'’t ever change. You can'’t just be a dick because of life. I don'’t want to be a dick. No. You don'’t get to say that because I'’ve offered you a solution to get better, and you completely refuse to even give it a look. Despite the fact that it'’s worked for me, and my sister, and my dad. Um, I have looked at it. I don'’t know why, because it's completely fucking crazy, but I have looked at it. So, you don'’t get to say that. But did you though? Or did you look at it with this critical pointed eye because you'’re so worried about what other people think of you? I'’m not worried about what people think about me. I just happen to agree with the masses who think it'’s a dangerous cult, who'’s out to take people's money by selling them snake oil. I'’m sorry, they're doing actual harm in the world. Yeah, see you say that, but what have you seen? What have you witnessed, except for them doing good? You said that to me! You said what you saw with your own eyes was all a drastically positive experience. That it helped you. So, why don'’t you want help? I was placating you because I don'’t want to lose you. I love you and I want to be with you. I just don'’t want to have to explain to our children why they were raised in a cult. We'’re going to fight over our hypothetical children again? I already said they should choose for themselves. You don'’t get to think for yourself when you'’re six and surrounded by kooky people. What is so kooky? Not what you read, not what some friend said. What have you seen except for really nice people who want to help other people, and really do? Do you know how difficult your grandmother'’s funeral was for me? Can we talk about that? How about that giant cross around the neck of the minister? What was that? It'’s a symbol representing the Dynamics. No, it'’s not Valerie. It'’s a cross. A Christian cross, and you know why they use it. The symbol predates Christianity. - No, it doesn'’t. - Yes, it does! No, it doesn'’t... That'’s not why they use it. They use it for a reason that was far truer, probably in 1950-something when they originally picked it, than even today. They use it because it subconsciously has an effect on people based on their childhood spent in Christianity. That'’s exploitative. Secondly, what is that whole part where they normally read Bible scriptures, but instead you hear this seven minute long, lyrical poem by L. Ron Hubbard? I'’m sorry, but that was complete gobbledygook. It literally sounded like a book by Dr. Seuss, but way longer and worse. And nobody even knows that because the whole crowd comes up to the minister afterwards, and they'’re like "Lovely words, lovely words." And he'’s like, "It'’s not me, it was LRH". What the fuck? And then the ending? Where people say how they remembered her? What was that? Nobody had anything real to say, they were all just like "Oh, if it weren'’t for Susie, I would have never reached OT level whatever the fuck." Is that what it'’s going to be like when you die? - That'’s it, I'm leaving. - No, this is where you live. - It'’s over. - No. I love you and this is your home. Where are you gonna go? My sister'’s. And then starting by bringing awareness to the area of your heart in this moment, and just getting a sense of if your heart feels open or closed right now. - Mm. -And this is not in order to change it, but in order to know. - Mm. -And please remember, that, in loving-kindness practice, the intention is the most important thing. The intention to develop a more open and friendly heart. Towards yourself and towards everybody you... [doorbell ringing Who is it? It'’s me. Astor, open the door. Not until you agree to not move out. Astor. Astor. That'’s the deal. I don't quit. It'’s my best quality. You said we were gonna talk about this. We did. Ad nauseam. You'’re only making this harder on yourself, mate. Why is he here? To help me move. Fuck you, for real? You'’re going to bring a stranger into this? Please, open the door. We'’re gonna talk. - Turn this off. - It'’s our song. Have you become a Scientologist now, too? Don'’t be mean. This is so hard for me. I have nowhere to go. Then don'’t go. I want you here! No, you don'’t. That'’s not true. Are you sleeping with him? He'’s my sister's boyfriend. You know why we'’re breaking up don'’t you, mate? Because I won'’t become a Scientologist. Don'’t think you're not next. Hey, hey, hey. Don'’t do this, all right? You should just step out. Nobody'’s making me a Scientologist. That'’s fine. I'’m gonna go get a Mexican Coke. C'’mon, will you just talk to me for a second? This isn'’t easy, you know? Do you love me? Of course, I do, but sometimes that just isn'’t enough. All you need is love. No, that'’s a song. Hey. You guys moving out? - I am. - No. Ah, shit. Sorry. It'’s OK. All right, I'’ll see ya, Val. Good luck. C'’mon, let's just move this back upstairs. It'’s not too late. You came to my grandmother'’s funeral, who you know raised me, and you pulled people aside and said they were in a dangerous cult. I'’ll see you at your sister'’s birthday party and we'’ll talk about it more. OK? Everything'’s going to be all right. Feeling, ah, lonely... The nuclear family is, uh, is, uh, you know... It'’s a cell, it'’s like a prison cell. Most societies in history of the world, you have people living in the extended family unit, it'’s a tribal family with multiple generations living in the same house, and shared labor, OK, and companionship and so on... Where women are going home from the office where they may have a very... Hey, what'’s up, Astor? Sup, dude? How ya doin'’ man? How ya feelin'’? Not so good. You wanna get a drink? Uh, yea. Stand by. Hey, Gloria. Um, Astor needs to grab a drink. Yeah, you know? Gloria'’s sick. I just... I don'’t think tonight'’s good. Just one drink, man. I, um... Valerie moved out. Valerie moved out. And I'’m pregnant. So, unless you want me to--- Hey, man, you know, just... tonight'’s just not gonna work. But, later this week, for sure, we'’ll find some time. Um, you know what you should do? You should go downstairs. Just get real fucked up. You know what they say, the best way to get over somebody is to get on top of somebody new. All right. We'’ll, uh... do it later this week, man. All right, uh, later. Bye. So, you'’re a dancer... Mm-hmm. Like, at Rick'’s? A modern dance company. OK. And you'’re a survivalist? Is that a job? Well, it'’s like a little bit more of a hobby. But I think it sets a pretty solid foundation, morally, for a man. OK. So, like, you have an earthquake kit. Did you hear me? I said I'’m a professional survivalist. Do you know what that means? I have, like, four months of freeze-dried food for two, forty gallons of water, a water filter for radiation, iodide pills, gold, silver, a thousand rounds of ammunition, a shotgun... - You have a gun? - ...with two-- Well, I have, like, a shotgun. Like a... for the sound mainly, as opposed to a handgun. Wait, here in this house? - Yeah. - Are you fucking crazy? Oh, trust me, it'’s necessary. You'’d like it. As a woman, I think it would probably make you feel secure. But why do you have all this stuff? Mm, it was like a hormonal response. Uh, I was moving in with my first girlfriend, - and we got this puppy and-- - Oh, what kind? Mm, it was a French Bulldog. - That'’s so cute! I love dogs. - Yeah. So, this thing just kicked in where I realized if something bad happened I'’d be the one responsible, and I just didn'’t want this thing on my conscience, like, I'’d have to call her dad up and be like, "Oh! I'’m sorry, sir, I'’m a pussy, your daughter'’s dead." Or... Then I lost my dog. That'’s so sad that you lost your dog. Yeah, I mean, like, technically, yeah. I mean, it was a domestic dispute. You know how these things go, the women always gets the kids. You poor thing. Aw, you'’re really empathetic. Somebody just left you. I knew it. There'’s just no other way to explain someone as pretty as you being alone at a bar and then back here so quickly with me. I'’m just... I mean, it's OK. Everybody gets hurt. I mean, if that'’s what happened. We don'’t have to talk about it. I'’m sorry. I shouldn'’t have said anything. But, let me just say one more thing. What I really mean... What I meant to say was that I'’m 100 percent certain that he did not deserve you. You wanna see my gun? All right. - I don'’t usually-- - It'’s OK. I'll be right back. What the fuck are you doing? - It'’s my gun. - It'’s a real gun?! You said you wanted to see it. Oh, my God, you'’re a fucking psycho, stay the fuck away from me! What? I said, "Do you wanna see my gun?" - And you said, "Yes." - I thought you were talking about your dick. Whoa! Whoa! It'’s locked. - It doesn'’t fire, it can't fire. - Do not follow me. How are things? - Hectic. But when are they not? - Yeah. Thanks for doing this. - It'’s no problem. - I really appreciate it. Hey, guys, uh, let'’s get started. Thanks for coming out here today, I really appreciate it. Um, let'’s just quickly go around the room and introduce ourselves. Lawrence, one of the producers. Henry, other producer. Regina, Costumes. Astor Williams Stevenson, writer-director. May, DP. Max, PM. Irina, production designer. James, first AD. All right guys, uh, thanks for trekking this far east. It'’s easier on us, we'’re wrapping our last movie outta here. Um, wanted to get you guys all here together for two reasons today. First, just to put everybody in the same room together with Astor, talk about the big picture; the vision of this film. And, second, so Henry here can say, "No," to all of your budget requests. Or yes. So, good news. We have locked the horse track location. So, I will be available to answer logistical questions on that at the end of the meeting. Right now, I think, Astor'’s gonna say a few things. It'’s real simple. I just... I know this is a story about young love, and I know it'’s a story about two people who were damaged earlier in life, but I just want to make sure we'’re also telling a much broader story about hope. Um, I wanna show that two damaged people can actually be there for each other. And I just wanna have a movie with a happy ending, you know? So many independent films, almost all of them, end without any sense of hopefulness for this world, or for love, or really for anything, and I'’m just sick of that, and I think it'’s bullshit. Um, these characters are very damaged, they'’re sexually confused, and they'’re coming up against a lot of obstacles, but it'’s really not so much easier in real life, and people are seeming to make it work every single day. So, let'’s show that. The more positive side of things, and, um... make it real at the same time. - Hey! - Hey, How'’s it goin'? How'’s it goin'? Uh, I'’m good. - How are you? - I'’m good. - This way. - Nice, uh, outfit you got there. Thank you. - I think. I think... - You... you look good. - Thanks. - Very spiffy. - Oh! Sorry. - Sorry... sorry. Did you just do that thing, '’cause... 'cause I'’m a girl and you'’re a boy? Uh, I think so, yeah. I like that. - Are you OK? - Yeah. How long have you been single for? Uh, like a week. - Oh, wow. OK. - How '’bout you? Um, definitely more than a week. So, you'’re not even, like, really single yet. - Well... - Are you kind of, like, worried that someone'’s gonna see you and me? We should just get married. Tonight? Yeah. All right. Maybe! Maybe we should, like, see how good the play is first, though. - All right. - OK? Oh, hey, where'’ve you been? You almost made her miss the beginning of the show. I said I couldn'’t go in without you, so... I was just right over there getting us drinks. You can'’t bring those in actually, we'’re about to start, so... I'’m not gonna throw them away. The lights haven'’t even cued yet. What about all these other people? They'’re not for me! There'’s, like, four other shows here. We all share a lobby. Uh, here, you know... - Thanks for coming though. - Mm-hm. You know me, I'’m a huge supporter of Avant Garde theatre. Totally, of course, and I think as a director you'’re really going to appreciate this. You wanna sit over there? Uh, yeah, yeah. That'’s fine. I don'’t know why we had to rush? He'’s just nervous, you know? It'’s, uh... It'’s his first night. You know how it is. Secretively, I hate stuff like this. I know Avant Garde is just... it just means shit. I'’m so glad you said that. I was just feigning excitement to impress you. - Should we? - We could. - He wouldn'’t know. - He thinks we'’re gross. - Disgusting. - We are? - We crawl all over... - His clothes... - All over his bed. - Loves only him. - Only him. - Only him. - Only. - Only him. - Only. - Only him. Only him. - Only him. - Only him. Me! Me. Me. Me. Us. - At the end of-- - At the end of the-- - End of the world. - As the end of the world... Begins. The Gimlet. Incredibly refreshing drink. Unfortunately, it'’s British. Cheers. Mm, it'’s so good. Thank you. You are welcome. It'’s one of the few things I can do right. - That you can do right? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. No. So far, yeah. Mm, so, can I tell you something? Depends. Do you wanna compliment me some more or... No. There'’s no more complements tonight. - OK. - That'’s it. Um, yeah, so, my... my ex is actually Quentin Tarantino. - Oh, really? - Yeah, but that... that'’s not why I'’m production designing his next film. I don'’t... I don'’t want you to think that. - Of course. Of course. - No. That'’s not why I was laughing. - OK! I didn'’t know. - Yeah. I... I mean, does it bother you? That... that I dated him, or...? Because he'’s your father'’s age or...? - No. - No, I mean, why would it? I mean, you know. It'’s like, you're a director, he'’s a director. He'’s just like a little, just like a tiny bit more, maybe, established than you? I don'’t know. A little more successful? All right, fair. - Um... not really. - Mm-hm. I'’m not really the jealous type, so, it'’s fine. - Here, come here. - OK. - It'’s OK. - It'’s all right? - Everybody makes mistakes. - You forgive me? No, I don'’t mean that. I'’m sorry. Hey, um, do you wanna sleep over? Mm... Maybe. I mean, you don'’t have to. - Mm-hm. - Do whatever you want, but-- Good, thank you. I'’m glad I have free will. - But if you want to... - Mm-hm. - I could give you a new toothbrush... - OK. ...and a t-shirt of your picking. - A t-shirt? That'’s-- - You don'’t get to keep it. What?! That... OK. - But you can pick out your own. - I can... but can I borrow it? - For the night. - OK. I wanna... I wanna see these t-shirts. - I'’m actually very, very excited about this... - OK. - All right, I'’ll show it to you then. - OK. - Can I take this inside? - You may. OK. OK. You'’re so fun. - What? - You'’re... I'’m normal. I think you'’re just... haven'’t been with somebody as young as me in a while. You don'’t have to do that. It'’s OK. I mean, I don'’t really like it, so... - All right. - You lie down. OK, just relax. Are... Are you OK? Uh, does it smell? Did you throw up? Uh, yeah. I think I threw up on your dick. Yeah, I think you did. Does it smell? Uh, a little. It'’s OK. It'’s OK. Yeah. I know, thank you. Can you... can you hop in the shower, please? You came in my throat. You'’re fine. That was a first. - What? - I said, "That was a first." I'’ve never thrown up on someone before. - Do you throw up a lot? - No! This is all your fault, you know. How'’s that? Your dick'’s too big. So, why didn'’t things work out with your ex? Uh, fundamental life stuff. Francine? Yes? I love you. Where are you going? Yeah, I can'’t sleep over. - I mean... I mean... - C'’mon. We just met, and, I have to really get some sleep '’cause I have that new film I'’m starting tomorrow, so... - OK. - Mm-hm. Is that gonna be difficult for you? Oh, working with him? Uh, I... yeah, imagine so... Is he gonna try to have sex with you? Maybe. I kind of hope so, actually. I mean, I'’m still in love with him, so. So, this is it? No! I... I think, like, me and you could totally, just... we could be friends. Or, you... you could, like, call me up in four months. I'’ll walk you out. Nah, I'’m all right. No, I want to. C'’mon. Um, I... I'’d actually really prefer if you didn'’t. It'’s OK. I will... I'’ll see ya. I really appreciate that. That'’s great, let's... let'’s talk soon. Hey, what'’s up? Uh, shut the door. How'’s it goin'? It'’s goin' OK, you know? It'’s going fine. Um, it all works out, you know, it always does. Unfortunately, we didn'’t get the news that we were hoping for today. We still haven'’t closed Taylor'’s contract. Are you serious? Yeah, but it'’s OK, I mean, look, this is just a game that reps like to play. It was exactly the same on Adaline and Emily. If you remember, we closed Ryan'’s deal two days before we wrapped, yet he still showed up every single day, he still shot your movie. It wasn'’t a thing. No, you'’re right, but these are teens, so, I need to know that they'’re committed. They are committed. They'’re in. I wouldn'’t worry about it. Mary, Taylor'’s manager, just wants to have one more call with you. - With me? - With both of us. Well, is it creative? I don'’t know. She didn'’t really say. Well, if it is, that'’s not appropriate at this stage. Look, you'’re working on a whole new level here. You have to play their game. Just make them feel like this is a collaboration. - Which part? - Everything. All right, let'’s, uh, let'’s do the phone call. All right. I love talking to people. Mary Wexler'’s office. Hi, yes. Lawrence Hanson and Astor Williams Stevenson for Mary, please. Just a moment. - Lawrence. - Hey, Mary, how'’s it goin'? Um, I'’m here with Astor Williams Stevenson, our director, if this is a good time for you? Hey, Mary, it'’s Astor. I just want to say that Taylor is doing amazing. She is so excited. Um, and, I just know the movie is going be amazing with her. We'’re so excited to have her. Thank you. She'’s very excited. I'’ll make this quick. This thong-underwear slash topless thing isn'’t going to happen. Um, Mary, just so we'’re clear, you mean the pool scene, right? Not the sex scene? Because, Astor, as requested, has already removed all nudity from the sex scene on account of Taylor being a minor. Correct, we'’re talking about the pool scene. Um, OK, so, Mary, just for clarification, um, I don'’t know if you'’ve read that, but that'’s a completely non-sexual scene, that the state attorney general has signed off per your request, and it went to you and her parents for approval before it ever went to her, so... All I'’m saying is, we were pretty committed, from the beginning, to working with people that this wouldn'’t be a problem for. We'’re committed. It'’s just the thong and toplessness. We sent over alternative underwear, did you see those? Standby. OK, um, Mary? Uh, I'’m just seeing this now... This is, uh... A... I guess these are work out shorts? Uh, and a sports bra? You know... I'’m trying to imply that the character is sexually loose because of a deep insecurity not that she is in a yoga class. We could also explore, like, head replacement and a body double. I'’ll have to get back to you on that. So, let'’s move on to the second concern. The spanking scene on page three. How exactly are you planning on shooting that? What do you mean? The angle? Because, it'’s from the side. There... there'’s, so there's no actual, literal nudity there. We can see that in the script. I mean, in terms of the act. Are you actually planning on having a grown man spank Taylor? It'’s a... It'’s a very low angle shot, so it doesn'’t matter to me who spanks her. It could be her best friend, or whomever makes her feel most comfortable. So, you'’re planning on actually filming that? Uh, yeah, listen, Mary, if it'’s in the script, I'’m planning on filming it. Which is why it'’s in the script. Um, otherwise, I wouldn'’t put it in the script. All right, well, I'’m going to circle back with her agent and we'’ll be back in touch. Thank you. That did not go well. Uh, yeah, what did you want me to say then? Because, I'’m not the one changing things. That went to her for approval way before it ever went to her client. You know, you just have to play their game a little bit. What would you like me to say? You want me to ask her to come down here and co-direct with me? Look... I'’ll call her. I'’ll work it out. It'’ll all be fine. Just me and her. But you gotta get it together. This is part of your job. This is not the last time this is gonna come up, so, you better learn to handle it. All right. Hey, honey. Hey, Mom. How'’s the movie going? It'’s going all right. You know, your father has some ideas about your story. - You should listen to him.-I don'’t want to. He'’s really good at that kinda thing. He'’s a very talented artist. No, he'’s not, Mom. He'’s not good at anything. He'’s a delusional failure. He'’s a failed artist. Show me any art that he'’s producing. Show me where it is. You can'’t. He'’d literally be homeless if it weren'’t for the first half of his life being supported by his father and now, I guess, the second half of his life now being supported by you. I guess you have to think this, or whatever, to support what you'’re doing, but don'’t put it on me. Don'’t make me have to feel that way. I can'’t be around him, because you guys all pretend like he'’s supporting himself from God knows what. But, meanwhile, I'’m actually out there busting my ass trying to not be him. If I were him I'’d literally rather die. Fucking delusional failed narcissist. It'’s OK. I'’m sorry I upset you. It'’s OK. I'’ll talk to you later. So, um, my sister is coming into town tomorrow, and then I am starting my new movie. So, I may not see you for a little while. That'’s OK. I get it. Thanks. Sorry. No, I liked it. Have you ever had an abortion? I'’m sorry, it was, uh, a really, uh, stupid thing to say. - I just asked-- - It'’s OK. I shouldn'’t have. I just haven'’t talked about it with anyone before, so... Even my best friend doesn'’t know. How '’bout your mom? She must know? No. You wanna talk about it? No. You just went to Planned Parenthood by yourself, or...? No, my high school boyfriend drove me. He waited in the lobby with me, but... he left because he got scared. There were people literally, like, protesting outside. I'’m sorry. It'’s nothing. I'’m... I'm just being stupid. No, you'’re not. Hi! Hey, you look great. Yes, you can put your things there, if you'’d like. How long have you been writing it for? Uh, two years, or so. So, you want this day bed? Because you can sleep here if you'’d like, but you can also have my bed. No. No, I like... I like this. OK, good. If you get hungry then, there is three months of freeze-dried food under here - and some shotgun shells. - Oh. - So, you can fully defend yourself. - Oh, great. Yeah, is that... Preparing for the apocalypse, are we? Uh... It'’s complicated. - Hey, have you talked to Mom, or Dad recently? - Yeah. I talked to her yesterday and she did not say you were coming, which I thought was odd, and you know I don'’t talk to Dad, so... Well, I didn'’t tell her I was coming, because I haven'’t been talking to her much. OK. So, what do you want for dinner? Uh, anything. Please, tell me, are you still a vegetarian? - No. - Ahh! - Nope, not anymore. - All right, OK. I really like Valerie. Thanks. Well, she'’s sweet and she'’s really nice to me. Thanks. Why would you say that? Well, because, you said that it'’s maybe not over, so I... I think that you can get her back. Why do you like her? She'’s just so real, you know? Like, when she and her sister came to visit me in New York? They were so together. Like, they'’re pretty and cool, and it'’s like they'’re not even trying, it'’s just the way they are, you know? It'’s like they're real artists. You married a Muslim and it didn'’t work out. You should understand where I'’m coming from. Hey, that'’s not fair! Mohammad and I did not separate because of religion. It was way more complicated than that. Do you still talk to him? He'’s my best friend. Her whole family were Scientologists. Well, have you even looked into it? No. Yes and no. He'’s still your best friend? We were talking about having a baby. What? Madeline, you can'’t do that. It didn'’t work out. You gotta move on. You should be dating. I... I have been dating... and the guys are worse. - Don'’t say that. - Why? I wanna have kids and he'’s kind to me. You don'’t know what it'’s like in New York. Like, everyone is so self-obsessed. They'’re all holding out for this dream of something. And then... and then time just keeps passing, and... You know, I know these people. They'’re all rock stars at their jobs, and then they just end up getting old and staying forlorn and... and then when they finally realize it, and they try and, you know, find whoever'’s left to have kids with it... it'’s too late. And then they'’re... and then they'’re really just alone. Like, forever. - Jesus. - Now, I don'’t want that, not for you either. Yeah, maybe I shoulda fought harder for Jackie. No. No, she wasn'’t nice. I didn'’t like her as much. Well, that'’s the thing. We kind of were the same so it worked. - I'’m not very nice either. - You are though. I... I threw a beer on her at Tribeca, in public. Well, she probably deserved it. Yeah, didn'’t she leave you just when her TV show got picked up and she made some money? You didn'’t know her that well. It'’s... It was complicated. It doesn'’t seem like it. Hey, you remember when you came and visited me in New York last? Yeah. Where did you go when you didn'’t come home? I don'’t think I can say. Please? I think I need to know. Hello? Hey, Jackie. Hey. Do you have a second? What'’s up? - It'’s been a long time.-Um... I guess... I'’m calling to apologize. OK. Things didn'’t work out with Valerie. Mm-hm. And... I guess I'’m getting to the stage where I see it as a recurring pattern? - Mm-hm.-And... was wondering if maybe you would have some advice for me, having been somebody who was with me for so long. I am so glad you asked me that. It really means a lot that you'’re facing this head on for the first time. I mean... offhand? I can say you had some jealousy issues, for sure. But then I wasn'’t really into it, so, maybe that was founded. You know, Ryan and I went through some real trust issues and we found this really amazing therapist who has worked wonders. ♪ Baby, please don'’t go ♪ ♪ I believe there'’s a man done gone ♪ ♪ Baby, please don'’t go ♪ ♪ I believe there'’s a man done gone ♪ ♪ I believe there'’s a man done gone to the county farm ♪ ♪ With his long chain on Are you all right? Why are you here, Astor? Because you invited me? A month ago, when things were a bit different. Why would you be playing "Madama Butterfly" at a party I'’m not invited to? It'’s my favorite opera. Uh, I like it? Your sister hadn'’t even heard of it until I played it for her. Which has to be the same for you because you two share the same goddamn brain. Right, well, I practically live in Switzerland at this point. Because of Basel? This is Italian. I find it romantic. It'’s about imperialistic brutalism. It'’s literally the story of an officer who leaves his wife and steals their child because she isn'’t white, and she kills herself. Well, doesn'’t that sound familiar? No wonder it'’s your favorite opera. Racial bigotry, religious bigotry. And by the way, Brutalism is a form of 1950'’s architecture, you quasi-elitist prick. And you don'’t need to tell us that Taylor Touring is in your movie, because we don'’t give a fuck! You guys are all in a cult. Maybe some of you don'’t know that, but if you'’re unaware, you'’re all slowly being sucked into a pseudo-spiritual global pyramid scheme. And just for the record, I'’m not for sale. Why do you keep doing this to me? You say you wanna be with me and that'’s what you think? Stop calling me. I'’m not picking up for a reason. I'’m sorry, I shouldn'’t have come. I'’ve been awful to you, I'’m sorry. I'’m sorry. Slimy... You wasted three years of her life. Action! Another flawless victory! That is a great crowd. You guys are gonna have a lot of fun. Really? '’Cause it seemed like they hated me. I'’m an artist. Ready? Yeah. Fuck them! Fuck those stupid motherfuckers! Who gives a fuck! Sorry, you know... - I looked into the camera! - OK, let'’s do it again. - Can we do it from the top, Anthony? I'’m sorry. - Still rolling! - I was, like, bam! - You'’re good, you're good. Fuck them. Fuck those stupid motherfuckers. Yeah. Fuck them. Fuck those stupid motherfuckers. Everybody set? - OK. - Action! - I need to talk to you. - OK. Ah, another flawless victory! That is a great crowd. You guys are gonna have a lot of fun. Really? '’Cause it seemed like they hated me. I'’m an artist. There'’s no easy way for me to say this, so... just gonna say it. I have very bad news. Got a call from Jim, who'’s Taylor's agent. I'’ve never spoken to Jim before, I'’ve only ever spoken to Mary, her manager. OK. They are pulling Taylor from the film. Effective immediately. It is, um... non-negotiable. There'’s nothing that we can do to change this. He is very sorry, but... it is the final decision. Did... Did you ask why? I did. Do you wanna know why? Of course. They have lost trust in you as a filmmaker and also, um, she no longer feels safe with you. Do you think she actually said that? I don'’t know, man. Um, I'’m really sorry. How can they say that? We'’re ten days away from shooting and she was fine this morning. Look. We will make this film. We will, I promise you. It'’s just not gonna be now, um, - and it'’s not gonna be with her. - We can recast it? We'’ll try again next year. I don'’t understand why you'’re not on the phone doing something about this. On the phone with who? All of our financing is tied to her. There is nobody that we can recast that will satisfy the financier'’s terms. She'’s not some 40-year-old guy. She'’s a teenage girl. There is only one of her. Um, I'’m very sorry, but... Yeah. Ahh! - Hey. - Hey. Good, you look good. - Thanks. - Come in. - You wanna drink? - Sure! - You want wine? - Something strong. - Uh, whatever you'’re having. - All right. Sit over there. How'’s your work going? The same. We don'’t have to talk about it. How'’s your movie going? It'’s going all right. Thanks for calling me. I know how busy you are. Cheers. No, you need to look me in the eye when you cheers. Otherwise, it'’s bad luck. Do it again. - Cheers. - Good. Have you been a good girl? Mm... I... I told you not to wear panties. I'’m disappointed. Go to the bathroom, take them off, and come back out here. Good. Now go over there. Stand over there. Turn around and pull up your skirt. Good. Now, put my cock... in your mouth. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'’m gonna cum. You want some water? You want some water? Sure. Here. Thanks. What'’s going on? Oh, nothing. C'’mon. C'’mon. Nothing. C'’mon, I feel like we just always have these surface interactions. You can tell me what'’s going on with you. I like to know sometimes, you know? It'’s nothing. C'’mon. I just... I just really like you. Well, that'’s not so bad, I like you, too. It'’s not the same. I get it. Shut up, I'’m being stupid. Let'’s have another drink. Not water. All right, but... c'’mon. Tell me what'’s going on. If you'’re not going to be honest with me, I... I don'’t know what the point of us pretending like we'’re having a conversation is. I get it. You'’re busy. You have a lot going on and... You probably never think about me, except, for like once a month when we see each other. That'’s OK! I... I'’m not asking for more. That'’s not fair. I don'’t think about you just once a month. C'’mon, I'd see you more. I'’ve just been really busy. Listen, you do what you need to do. You wanna... you wanna see other women, or, sleep with them, or, whatever, it'’s fine! I mean, you don'’t even have to keep it a secret from me. It could, like, be our thing and I'’d be OK with it. Just as long as you made time for me. Well, I don'’t know what you'’re saying. We haven'’t really had a talk or anything. I'’ve just... I'’ve been busy working. I think about you a lot. Like, every day. Like, every hour. I mean, I do a lot of things, and when I'’m doing these things, I think about you. But, I don'’t tell you, because I know it'’s not the same for you. Well, that'’s not fair. You really don'’t know me very well. I know you. You... you really don'’t. I... I am not, uh... This... this is like a half me. You... you haven'’t even met a real me. I'’m in... Trust me, this guy you'’ve met? Uh, you don'’t wanna be with this. The timing... the timing is off. I know what you are. I like this half you! It'’s... it's a part of you. You'’re like... you're an artist and you'’re going for it and that means the world to me! I mean, I know what'’s important to you. I went to art school, but now I'’m selling BMWs because I got scared. Everyone gets scared, but you'’re not. We can'’t see each other anymore. Forget what I said. - It'’s not that. - You know, I could support you? And... just for a little bit. Just until you made it really big, and it'’d make me happy. I... I'’d gladly do it. Just... - Uh... - Forget what I said. I will never make you happy. You think we have a deep connection, but we don'’t. You'’re just something I call up late at night when I want to have a good time because you look different from most women I'’ve slept with. And you have some propensity for pleasing me that far exceeds my pornographic desires. That'’s it. You don'’t get to talk to me like a child. I know what you are. I know what I am to you. You made me say these things, I mean, we can just have fun. You are 29 years old. You come from a traditional Korean family who wants you to marry a nice guy and you'’re gonna get married. You'’re at your absolute prime right now, both physically, and in terms of anything that'’s deemed not going down. So, I'’m literally wasting your best asset away. Right now is when you need to find a nice guy, who'’s a little dumber than you, who'’s gonna worship you the rest of your life. Not ten years from now. Because now you can still find something that'’s pretty fucking good. But ten years from now? You'’re not gonna get shit. Fuck... Fuck you! You don'’t get to tell me what I want. Fuck you! I know what I want. I'’ve had nothing but love for you.
