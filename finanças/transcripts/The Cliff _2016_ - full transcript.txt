BASED ON THE NOVEL "EL CONTENIDO DEL SILENCIO" BY LUCÍA ETXEBARRIA See you! Bye! Get ready for the rough weather again: cold, snow and big waves. - Amaya, the weather is already changing. - Yes, it's cold and this morning... - Hello. - Hi, love. - How are you? - Fine, and you? Fine. - What? - There's a vacancy in the Ministry. - And yours is the only name on the table. - That's great. The official announcement will be issued in one week. - Are you happy? - Yes! Very much! Hi, boss. - What do we have here? - Eight bodies. Five women, three men. The current is bringing them to the shore. The coastguard can hardly cope. Apparently, they jumped off that cliff. - Any identifications? - Just a few so far. There are several foreigners. Any news about Ribera? Hello? Yes, I'm her brother. Did something happen to her? Yes, yes, sure... I'll catch the first flight I can find. Thanks for calling. - What's wrong? - The police. The members of a cult committed mass suicide in the Canary Islands. Apparently, Cordelia was with them. But is she dead? There is an unidentified body. They think it might be my sister's. I'm so sorry. - Are you Gabriel? - Yes. I'm Helena. Your sister and I were roommates. - I warned the police. - Mr. Larrea? - Yes. Hello. - Hello. Vicente Martínez. Police inspector of Gran Canaria. - Come with me, please. - Sure. We've found the same substance in all the bodies. A strong opiate. So they were drugged when they jumped. Everything seems to indicate that. It's not her. No, it's not her. Here, on this one. And here. Boss, this is for you. - Sorry. - Inspector Santana, Gabriel Larrea, district attorney in Bilbao. - Hi, Helena. - Hi. Thanks, Martínez. You can go now. The picture you asked me to bring. Right before she joined the Community. Do you know her? - No. - Yes. She's Mother Heidi. That's what Cordelia called her. Heidi Meyer. The leader of the cult and the main suspect. We haven't found her body. - How could you not foresee this? - Those people didn't go against the law. They'd grow tomatoes, pay their taxes... You should know: without a crime, there's no case. - I need to ask you some questions. - Sure. - Your sister had money, didn't she? - Why do you ask? Some of the deceased had made big bank transfers in the last few days. - Including your sister. - My parents died when we were kids and... we did inherit some money. Was your sister involved with drugs? Drugs? What does that have to do with...? Yes. There was a time when we used all kinds of drugs. Any suicide attempt? - No. - Yes. I guess all this information is confidential. As far as I'm concerned, you're the relative of one of the victims. - I have no interest in making it public. - May I help you with anything else? If your sister's body appears, there'll be paperwork to deal with. You'd better stay for a few days. How many days? The investigation will take some time, but... if you don't think it's essential, you can go back to Bilbao. - We'll keep you informed. - I'll find a hotel. Thanks. - I'll take you there. My car is outside. - I'll wait for your call. I'm sorry we had to meet under these circumstances. Next time, I'd prefer that you did the identification alone. Yes, sure. Don't worry. So Cordelia and you were roommates? Yes, we lived together for over a year. I'm sorry, I hadn't heard about you. She did talk about you a lot. - Did she? - Yes. My sister always wanted to see the world. She drifted apart. - That's funny. - What? She said it was you who drifted apart. - Why don't you stay at my place? - Thanks. I don't want to bother you. It's no bother at all. On the contrary. I wouldn't like to be alone today. That's the one. Come in. You can sleep on the couch or on Cordelia's futon. You choose. - The couch is fine. - OK. - Hello? - I'll be right out! OK. Hey. I couldn't sleep, so I went out for a run. - You didn't sleep well. - I usually don't. That's a problem. I have to go to work. I made breakfast for you. Thank you so much. - See you later. - Thanks. Call me if there's any news. Martínez. - Show me the video. - It was recorded yesterday. - Heidi Meyer had no suicidal intentions. - She knows where the camera is. - And she makes no effort at all to hide. - Who's the other person? I'd say it's a woman, but I can't really tell. - What about the terminal? - We're going over the CCTV recordings. - So no record of her getting on a plane. - Exactly. Good. Forward that video to me. No, we still don't know anything. We need to wait for the body to appear. If it even appears. They asked me to stay for a few days. How's your father doing? Don't worry. He understands the situation. He'll cover for you. Thanks. I'll be waiting for you. - Call me if there's any news. - Sure. I'll call you if there's anything. Hey, I love you. I love you too. Bye. 15 PEOPLE FOUND DEAD IN THE CANARY ISLANDS TRAGEDY IN THE CANARY ISLANDS - Hi, can I help you? - Yes. - I was looking for these. - Let me see. You won't believe it, but I was just sorting out Blake's work. - Really? - Yes. He's one of my favorite poets. Here... I love his engravings too. Do you know them? - Yes. I've studied them at school. - What school? - Art School. - Oh! Then, you're gonna like this one. - Look. - Let me see. Let me show you my favorite. This one. - Do you like it? - It's huge! It's my uncle Antonio's. - Really? - Yes. - Seriously? - Yes. Do you want to see my bedroom? Yes? Hello. - Any news? - No, don't worry. Is that farm of the Community far from here? - Not too far, but it's in the mountain. - I'd like to have a look there. - It's not a good idea. - I'll go on my own. - The police told us to wait and be calm. - I'm calm. But I won't stand idly by. Gabriel, Cordelia's brother. Antonio, my uncle. And your boss, too. I'm really sorry about your sister. - Cordelia was a very special girl. - Do you mind if I leave earlier today? Take the afternoon off. - Thanks. I owe you one. - You mean another one. - See you tomorrow. - Bye! Cordelia! Cordelia, please, you need to go out. I can't stand seeing you like this. How can I get you out of this bedroom? Look at me. Look at me. You need to stop pitying yourself. Get up. Get up, come on. Get up. You can't go on like this. - She's sad. - She instills mystery. - Yes. - And melancholy too. - Hello! - Hello. You'll be very welcome. Bye! Meditation sessions. - Do you want to go? - What if we go together? You should start doing things on your own. They jumped off from here. The Europol has just sent an email. They want to control the investigation. They ordered Foreign Affairs to keep them informed. Many of the disappeared belonged to foreign powerful families. Diplomats, businesspeople... - In Europe, they fear the repercussions. - Shit... Close the door. What's that? In here, there's a list of bank accounts, under false names, out of Spain. If Heidi Meyer is still alive, she'll try to access them. Tell the Europol to investigate them. Where did this come from? Ribera. Any news about him? - Yaiza, they'll ask me questions. - And you won't answer them! If they really want to catch Heidi Meyer, they'll know what to do. Sure. No, no... - Not until we close the case. - At your orders, boss. Did you get something? They don't leave me alone for long, but... I copied all I could. - I was right to choose you. - Sure, inspector. The credit is all yours. Anything else? They're nervous. They talk about some final journey, but don't tell me much. We need to take action now. - Give me some time. - Are you sure? Be careful, Ribera. Yaiza, don't worry. What could happen to me? That I become a vegetarian? What about that girl you mentioned? Cordelia? She's a special girl. She's vulnerable. She's not like them. Don't get involved, Ribera. Shit! - We have a flat tire. - No... Yes. Do you have a spare one? - How can I open this? - Wait. Now. You don't have any. Oh, shit... They won't answer. So what now? - Any problem, guys? - We got a flat tire. - We don't have a spare tire. - Gee... This is not the right vehicle to drive here. Yeah. The tow truck guys won't answer. Let's see... Chedey? Hi! Do you have the tow truck there? Can you come and pick up a car? I'm at the rocky hill. I know. I already told them. OK, I'll tell them. OK, bye. They'll pick it up in a couple of hours. Leave the keys in. No one will steal it. - Great. - Thanks. - We're trying to get to the farm. - Why do you want to go there? Those people were not right in the head. - His sister was with them. - I'm sorry. - OK, then. I'll take you there. - Thanks. Hello! Hello. - What are you doing? - Heidi invited me to the farm. Mother Heidi... Those people are changing you. - Helena! - What is it? I'm moving in with them. - What? - Why don't you come with me? I have nothing to do with that and neither do you. - Do you know what they're doing? - What? They make you feel special to bring you around. So you don't think I'm special? I didn't say that. It's terrible. All those guys, dead... I ran into them a couple of times at the beach, meditating and swimming. They also visited the excavation a couple of times. I'm an archaeologist and I often work in this area. We're almost there. The bus stop is just a bit further down. There are buses every hour. - Thanks. - Careful. This place gives off bad vibes. These are the small houses with the shared rooms. The laundry space. Now, we're going to the main house. Come in. You can leave your bag there. This is my office. Let's see... You need to sign these papers. There's a community phone. You need to make an appointment to use it. If you need to buy something, you have to request it too. Any questions? - Thanks. - Come with me. This is your room. - Do I have my own bedroom? - That's what Mother has ordered. I'll leave you alone. Heidi gave her this stone the day we met her. I'll wait outside. Helena? What's wrong? - What happened? - It's nothing. - What do you have there? - Nothing. Did you hit your head? Let's get out of here. That place was sealed off for a reason. What were you doing at the farm? I'm not here as a tourist. I'm here because my sister is missing. And you won't call me or tell me anything. What kind of investigation is this? Mr. Larrea, I don't care who you are in Bilbao. Here, you're just a suspect's relative. - I'll decide what I tell you. - Suspect? Of what? We have evidence that your sister might be Heidi Meyer's favorite. Her protégée. Look at this. Your sister is always on Heidi's right. Like a shadow. We also know that Heidi Meyer is alive. So my sister could be alive too. - That's a possibility. - Do you have proof of this? Circumstantial evidence only. Those pictures and the fact that their bodies haven't appeared. But, if this was confirmed, your sister would become a suspect. - Charged with what? - Homicide, for one. - She'd never do that. - It makes no sense. You'd never imagine she'd join a cult, would you? Let me do my job and stay out of this. Let me see. Wait. Just a little bit... - Careful. - Wait. Now. Do you think she's alive? I think we must act as if she was. Look. I have a brother. He took care of me when I was a kid. But he abandoned you. I haven't seen him for so long. Some ties prevail over space. My father was my master. He taught me to listen to the earliest inhabitants of this island. And he instructed me to pass on his legacy. Unfortunately, I couldn't conceive a heir. Excuse me! Do you know where Cordelia is? Excuse me, I'm looking for Cordelia. Excuse me, do you know where Cordelia is? - So no one answers here, huh? - This is private property. - I'm here to see Cordelia. - Cordelia is not here now. - Then, I'll wait. - Not here. This is private property. I won't move until you let me see her. Cordelia! - Cordelia! - Helena! You have to come back home. - You have to, I'm begging you. - But I'm fine here! - No, you're not fine. - Yes. - No... - Yes. I have everything I needed. You don't have me! Don't you see they're brainwashing you? Don't you see it? I wish you could understand. I wish too. Because I don't understand. I have to go. But take care, OK? You look so beautiful. Go. It's not the first case in the Canary Islands. Something similar happened many years ago. I owned a kiosk for many years. Under Franco, censorship was rampant. The only way to find out about certain stuff was by the foreign press. The bodies of 12 cult members, found in the sea. Some of them were German and from other countries too. Let me see. Shit! - What? - That's the same cliff. How could the police not tell us about this? They must have this in their records. How many things were forgotten in this country? No one remembers the work camps for homosexuals set up in the islands. Places where many died. Or were scarred forever. History can be erased. It has been erased many times. - Yaiza. - Yes? The Europol have just called. The judge won't touch those accounts. They're under Swiss jurisdiction, there's no link to the cult. - We gave them the link. - They demand to know our source. - I'll talk to them. - Sure. - Because you're the queen of diplomacy. - Excuse me? Sorry. You're right. - We should talk to them about Ribera. - No. We can't act as if nothing happened. Hello? Are you here to complain about the tone I used this morning? No, it's not the tone I'm concerned about. Please. I'm concerned about you thinking that my sister might be a murderer. I said she might be involved. - In murder. - So now you're teaching me to do my job? I don't know if this would be of any use, but, apparently, that cult is older than it seemed. - Where did you get this? - We're both searching for the same thing. I know. But I'm under too much pressure with too little help. Then trust me. Let me help you. What I'm about to tell you must remain between us. I had been watching the Community. There was something I didn't like there. So I decided to infiltrate an agent. - Behind my superiors and everyone's back. - And you proved yourself right. I was right. I didn't do it right, though. If you're telling me all this, that means you think I can help you. That agent found some bank accounts the Community was hiding in Switzerland. I asked the Europol to investigate them. - But they say... - They need proof of their link to them. - Exactly. - What about that agent? Could we talk to him? I fear something serious must have happened to him. Do you want me to try? If we trace those accounts, we'll find Heidi Meyer. And my sister. And my agent. It's complicated, but I could try to get a precautionary order. I can't promise anything. I can't ask my father that, you know that. I'm not asking him to break the law, just to pressure his contact in Foreign Affairs. - I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. - I'll talk to him. - But he won't like it a bit. - Just try, please. I will. - Bye. - Talk to you soon. Dad? Hi... Shit! ACCOUNTS BLOCKED. What is it? The Community was founded 50 years ago. By a man who hides behind a false identity. His real name? Gustav... - Meyer! - Bring me all the information - from the central archives. - OK. Here's what I have. I hope you find some answers. Thank you so much. It won't be easy, though. - I'm not even sure of the questions. - Is everything alright? My niece looks like a tough woman, but she's not. She's a free spirit. Breaking up with Cordelia was especially hard for her. I truly hope you find your sister. I brought some tea. Look. Protected by goddess Tanit, Cordelia has conceived the heir. What is it, Marion? - It's not fair. - What's not fair? It should have been me. Your moment has gone. We know that. That child will be raised by you and me. Come here. What? Do you feel it? It's too soon. We're gonna be parents. That baby is not yours. I don't want to see you together again. I'm sorry. No, no, no! Put that there. Fucking allergy... - Excuse me! - We're closing in five minutes. We came to see Artemi Miralles. He works here, right? - Yes. Over there. - Thanks. - That's him, right? - Yes. - Artemi! - Just a second. I'm coming! OK, guys, let's start clearing up. - What a surprise! - How are you? - Hi. We thought maybe you could help us. - What could I help you with? Apparently, some 50 years ago, there was this cult in the island. Its members committed suicide by jumping off that same cliff. - I had no idea. - The rituals are common to both cults. Maybe. Anyway, those people's ideas were totally out of context. - They mixed pagan and Christian rituals. - Right. But jumping off a cliff? - See you tomorrow! - See you! Most natives of the islands chose suicide over slavery under the Spanish yoke. Do you know what this symbol means? It looks like a representation of goddess Tanit. Some contemporary pictograms have been seen around these cliffs. - It's a symbol of death. - You could say that, yes. We need to go. We're closing. Thanks. Shall we? There are some amazing sites around here. Good morning. Carol! Have you seen Julián? No, we haven't seen him today. - Bye. - See you. - Have you seen Julián? - No. Mother... Where's Julián? He's gone. He's not one of us anymore. - A beer. - Do you want some? Thanks. What happened between you and your sister? She never told me. I abandoned her. I left when she needed me the most. No. There's something else. There's nothing else. Then, why did you leave? While I was with her, you never called. - It has nothing to do with you. - It has everything to do with me. Where are you going? Don't come closer. Don't come closer! He's dead. We had to choose between him or the Community. You have to decide too. We need to bring forward the final journey. Here. Gustav Meyer. Born in 1935 in Hamburg. Wife: Paula Resano. Spanish nationality. Children: Andreas, born in 1951, deceased at 10 years old. - And Heidi. - Let me see. There's a list of properties here. They owned a building here, in Las Palmas. We have to find it. ADMISSION FORM THE COMMUNITY - We've got it. - I'll call you right back. An abandoned building, on the outskirts. - I've already got the search warrant. - Great. Let's go. The power is off. The company told me it was still on. - Any record of consumption? - Very low, but yes. Look. Gustav Meyer. It's warm. Martínez! Police! Against the wall. Cash... Traveler's checks... Credit cards of the cult members. What's wrong? What is it, Martínez? Where is he? He was dead when they threw him into the sea. They poisoned him with cyanide. I'm sorry. I need to talk to the woman you arrested. That's not possible. That woman might know something about my sister. I helped you. - My name is... - I know who you are. - Then, you know I can help you. - I don't want your help. I can also make things harder for you. - What do you want from me? - Where's my sister? She's no longer in this world. Your sister is dead. Trust me. She showed no qualms about jumping off that cliff. She wanted to do it more than anyone else. Your sister had begun to die a long time ago. Since the day you abandoned her to her fate. Look. Does this look familiar? Cordelia gave it to me right before she died. No, Yaiza! Not like that! What's wrong? - Santana! - Yes? I assume you know what I want to talk to you about. Yes. - I'm out of the case. - You're under disciplinary proceedings. - I know the arrested woman... - You punching a handcuffed suspect is the least serious of the whole series of mess-ups you've been collecting. You infiltrated an agent in that cult without consulting your superiors. Julián Ribera is dead now. And only you can take responsibility for that. - Anything else? - That's all. Martínez will take up the case. You bastard! You damn bastard! - Are you crazy? - How did he know Ribera was infiltrated? - Only you and I knew! - They're fed up with you going it alone. I was asked to inform about your moves. I couldn't refuse! - You couldn't. - I didn't give him away! You asshole! That cult has contacts halfway around Europe! Secrecy was the only way to protect him! What are you looking at? You know you can stay here for as long as you want. I didn't ask to take up the investigation. I just followed orders. The investigation is not closed yet. You started it and you have to end it. Let me do this with you. You can still get Heidi Meyer. That's what you wanted, right? I need to pick it up. I haven't heard about you. You don't answer my calls. I'm worried, Gabriel. - They stopped the search. - I'm sorry. At the district attorney's office, your absence is making them nervous. - That's the least of my concerns now. - How can you say that? It's your job. It's our future, love. You can't throw it all away. We worked so hard for this. Gabriel... React, please! I need you to come back. We'll talk some other time, OK? Do you have to go? - Take care, Gabriel. - Thanks for everything. Gabriel! - Something wrong? - No, I was with my friends and I saw you. - Are you going to the airport? - Yes, my flight is in two hours. - I'll take you there. - No, no... Yes, don't worry. Let's go. It's on my way. - Thanks for helping me. - Don't mention it. If you want some water, I have more here. Thanks. I'm sorry you have to leave without finding her. I'LL PICK YOU UP AT THE AIRPORT. I'M DYING TO SEE YOU. I LOVE YOU - Is this the way to the airport? - Yes. I'll make a right there and we'll be there in five minutes. HELP. I'M... Gabriel? Gabriel? Cordelia? Hello. I've been looking for you. And I've been looking for you. Forgive me. Are you pregnant? Untie me. Untie me, please. - Helena Salazar. - Let her in. Come in. Gabriel sent this last night. He says he needs help, but now he won't answer. Martínez! I'm glad to finally meet you. I'm sure you realized, for the first time in her life, Cordelia is not suffering. In return, you made her an accessory to murder. They freely made a decision. Who decides what's right or wrong anyway? When your sister and you were left alone, you protected her, but, then... Tell me what the fuck you want from me and let's get this over with! We just need to make a phone call to unblock our accounts. I'm asking you to do this for your sister and the baby she's expecting. Yes. Alright, thanks. They're tracing a call Gabriel made today to his wife from an unknown number. He didn't catch that flight. A taxi driver saw him getting on a dark blue SUV. He's not here. The guard says he has a speedboat and goes sailing once or twice a week. She's in labor. Calm down. Calm down. - Everything's gonna be fine. Calm down. - Untie me, please. I can help you carry her. Police! Finally! Where are you? I'm inspector Yaiza Santana. Police!
