Listen, Tenka. Kumo Family Graves (Tenka's parents' tombs) You don't need to be a great man. Offering of Sake Nor the greatest of big brothers. Mother and Father. What I'm saying is... Be the one who can laugh away problems. Let me spend some time here. 1879 The 12th year of Meiji Kumo Shrine Otsu, Shiga Prefecture Give me that. Somebody help! Move! They'll never catch us now. Out of my way! You asked for it, you scumbag. It's the year 1879. Japan is in the midst of its greatest transformation. A chaotic time marked by a spike in crime. The monster that emerges every 300 years has been destroyed after our battle. The skies are clear and Shiga has never been more vibrant. Laughter Under the Clouds Gaiden Parting The Oath of Yamainu Take a break. Thank you for the lesson. The prison we guarded is moving to Hokkaido? Yes, it has vast, open spaces, with a limited population. They plan to incarcerate major criminals there. So our prison in Shiga will be no more? Yes, before long, we must close down. I received the official notice yesterday. Yamainu will be disbanded. But why? Our mandate was to destroy Orochi, the giant serpent. With Orochi dead, Lord Iwakura, the Minister of the Right, no longer requires our services. What will the others do? Most were approached by the military to join their ranks. But Inukai and Shii are yet to decide. Will you join the military, Master? I shall, eventually. When the nation needs my services, I'm never happier. Until you're summoned, please continue to train me. We have lost the prison and our staunch fellows. But I shall still remain the head of the Kumo Shrine. Not even my brother will beat me. You've become quite cocky, Soramaru. He's becoming mentally stronger, too. Indeed. He'll grow even stronger. After all, he is Soramaru. Is that for him? Yes, apparently it's good for the constitution. I hope he likes it. Is that actually edible? Hello, dear Botan. Hello, Hirau. I looked everywhere for you. What about your job? I quit. You what? I want to be with you every moment of my life. You're so thoughtless. How would we make a living? I have savings, I can feed you. That's not the issue. I'll go inside and spend time with Soramaru. Sorry to delay you. Not at all. Bye. Maybe she's embarrassed. You miss all the social signals, don't you? Is she a ninja? Yes. Yes, based at the Kumo Shrine. We take tea together sometimes. Isn't she wonderful? You're going out of your way for her, aren't you? She has no home to return to, nor friend to rely on. After so long in the shadows, she's finally smiling again. But she's still unsure of many things. And so adorable when she fumbles to accept our support. I want to see her happy. And how has he been doing recently? Who? Ah, same as always. He remains unchanged. Brother Tenka, we have a guest. I'm coming in. How do you feel? I'm back. Do you still miss him? Welcome home, Chutaro. I'm just not used to it. That's all. Me, neither. I don't want to get used to it. Welcome home. Where's Sister Nishiki? She's out shopping for our dinner. No way! You promised to make dinner today. I tried to talk her out of it. It will be another total disaster. I told you to leave me alone. No, you need to listen. They're at it again. I said no! No, Tenka, don't. Tenka. Elder Brother. Oh, sorry. I'll be out for a while. Stop doing that inside! He's hopeless. No martial arts training today? Yes, we just finished. I see. Sorry about the fuss. Not at all. We appreciate you caring for him. Tenka's acting strange lately. What's wrong? So you failed again? Yes, but I thought I could do it today. Can't be helped, I suppose. Miss Kiiko! Please tell us. What is making Tenka so upset? He won't tell us anything. When you, or any of the Yamainu squad visit, he always gets upset. Really? It's been a year since we destroyed Orochi. Perhaps it's better that you know. Tenka carries a great burden. For those he loves. It all began about 11 years ago. 89, 90 92, 93 Yamainu Squad leader Tenka Kumo Sub-leader Sosei Abe Chenran Shi Zenzo Inukai Seiichiro Takamine Don't you dare stop! Ashiya, faster. Fight through the pain. If you can't take the training, you'll never kill Orochi. Taiko Kumo 99, 100 Now 30 more. 1, 2, 3... This is painful. You're disgusting! What's going on? Damn you! Silence in the dojo! Master, it's Tenka's fault again. Don't you dare run away. Wait! Kiiko, stop him. Don't drag me into your squabbles. Tenka! Concentrate. Yes, sir. You will all complete five laps around the oval. Tenka and Sosei, 10 laps. On your feet. Tenka! It's all your fault! What a waste. They're not really such a lost cause. How do you assess them? Their bodies and their strength are gradually improving. But they need more... More experience, I'd say. Yes, you're right. When you say, "Everyone must do laps", do you mean...? Yes, you chaps, too. A secret unit was formed to destroy the giant serpent, Orochi, which appears every 300 years. This special squad is called the Yamainu. The hidden heroes who will save the nation from destruction. I'm beat. I'm starving. Can we all gather at our place, Dad? You've all done well today. So, you're all invited to dinner. I'll take a bath first. There he goes again. He's always the first to leave. Everybody has their own ways. You don't need to force him. Your honors! What's up? Please, help us. Hurry it up, or we kill the hostage. Meet our demands now! A hostage standoff? Yes. Mere vulgar, common criminals. What are their demands? Release fellow gang members from prison. Seriously? Apparently, they're a band of robbers and burglars. They demand we release their fellows from jail. There's too many of them, it's too dangerous for the hostage. We'd best accept their demands. Listen, Tenka. You run the operation. I'm confident you can do it. Roger that, sir. What are you waiting for? Stop him! Stop it. Let me go. Who's this boy? The older brother of the hostage. Are you in charge? Release the prisoners and save my sister. You must rescue her. I beg you. Do whatever it takes to save her. You're a good boy. Don't worry. It'll be over soon. Numbers and location. Ashiya. All are armed with swords. Long swords. One fellow has a gun. That's bad. He could shoot the hostage. Where is the hostage? Tied up at the back of the building. I doubt we can just rescue the hostage. So what's your plan? What's going on? Why are you wasting time? Can you save her? Don't! Don't sneak off like that. Everyone get back. From the start, I planned to do more than just rescue the hostage. I never doubted you. Do as we say. But... The Yamainu are coming! Get everyone inside, strengthen our defenses. Find them and kill them! They've seen us. That was quick. Get a move on. Don't lie to me. How did they sneak in? Relax, there's only 7 of them. We're twice as many. And we have a hostage. Come down! Here goes. Hello. I'm here to rescue you. Very well done. You're an idiot. Why's that boy there? Father. Are you hurt? Kiiko, go see to the hostage. They were expecting you to break in. That left you open to an ambush. One of the bystanders informed their lookout. What's going on? Who are you? We're the Yamainu. Yamainu? It's raining. Right, let's all head to my place. Ashiya, wait. You haven't been going home. Where do you sleep? None of your business. It is my business. I'm your teacher and your guardian. I've been staying with various girls around town. Your family would be devastated to hear that. They never care about what I do. You don't get along with your family? None of your business. Again, it is. Come with me. We, of the Yamainu, share a single fate. Your problems could create trouble for any of your fellows. I don't want to know all your secrets, but you must trust us. I trust all of you. Tenka? What's this for? You're from a well-known family of shamans. Your powers make you a good scout, but they can also be used in battle. I want to know your full capabilities. Just when I thought we'd finished training for the day. I can take you. No, you can't. Never look away. Too much dependence on your celestial servants. Never shy to beat up those weaker, are you? You fool. Those who battle Orochi get no quarter from me. That hit to my leg still hurts. You could easily kill me. He's definitely strong. I'm sure he could kill me. You know why I was chosen for the Yamainu? I was a potential empty vessel for Orochi. And not just me. Your son was also chosen. As were the other members of the Yamainu squad. Most Yamainu are potential vessels for Orochi. If you found Orochi within us, it would be easier for you. Isn't that why you brought us all together? My mother never knew the family secret. She never imagined that her husband's family would share the Orochi bloodline. You evil monster! She could never believe a shaman could transform into a monster. She cut all ties to me and my father. Are you scared of turning into Orochi? I wonder. Either way, I really don't care. But if I were Orochi, I would do my best to devour everything. Including my home and my family. But that would cause problems. I don't want to make trouble, whether I'm dead or alive. So please... If I have to, I'll kill you. Before you turn into Orochi. Because I'm invincible. Don't worry. I'll definitely kill you. I'll have to trust that you will. That's him in a nutshell. Too good to be true. Look, if I ever turn into Orochi... I'd kill you. And if I became Orochi, I'd expect you to kill me. I can't leave our master to do this alone. Could I ever kill them? Welcome back! Been a good boy? Sure. Tenka. You're soaking wet. Get inside, quickly. Listen, Tenka. Tenka? Hello. Been waiting for me? The others are already here. You seem pleased about something. Yes, Ashiya is making his first visit here. What if Orochi were Soramaru, or Chutaro? Could I kill them? Come on, eat up. Don't force him. Right then, you eat it. The Yamainu are not encouraged to think. Our sole reason for existence is to fight Orochi and save the nation. No Yamainu is ever allowed to die. And we must never vacillate. Our mission is clear, we battle Orochi. No matter what happens. Kumo Family Graves (Tenka's parents' tombs) Mommy, Mommy! Chutaro... Stop that! What did you say? I'm quitting the Yamainu. Don't be ridiculous. Can you betray our master? Betray your sacred duty? It's just too much for me. How dare you? Stop it, Sosei. How can you do this? You're the Master's son. You boasted that you'd become a hero. Will you throw away all your dreams? What about Kiiko, me and your Yamainu fellows? You can become their leader. There was never any plan for me to lead the Yamainu. Did you mean that? Are you sure? Sorry, I'm just not cut out to lead Yamainu. I'm very disappointed in you. I never want to see you ever again. That goes for anyone else who wants to quit. But I shall stay, even if I'm the last. I don't plan on quitting. As long as Yamainu exists, I shall be with you. If you shoulder the burden of leading, I'll follow you anywhere. It goes without saying. Kiiko, no need to stay with me. Keep the Yamainu unit intact. You fool. I know. And it really hurts me. Kumo Residence You're back? They've just fallen asleep. Thanks for tending to them. Both were in tears, crying for you. How's your body coping? I'm getting better. The Orochi cells must be adapting to me. Are you sure about that? This experiment can only end with you being executed. I know. I already died once when my parents were killed. Why must you sacrifice yourself? A couple's first child is always loved. Such emotional focus teaches the child to love. Tenka, you're a big brother now. Look how tiny your brother is. It's the duty of the oldest boy to mentor his younger siblings. I've received much love, now it's your turn. It's not always necessary to become a great man. Nor be the best of big brothers. Be the one who can laugh away problems. Laugh and show good humor, to make your brothers cheerful. I shall always love you with all my heart. So Tenka actually quit because of his concern for us? I'm sure family obligations were a contributing factor. He wasn't happy with the way Yamainu was going. It wasn't any one reason. You must never think he sacrificed his life for you two. I think quitting was actually good for him. Now he's not duty-bound to kill you vessels of Orochi. I always wanted to be the Master's son. Tenka has made some good, loyal friends. With one major exception. But why is Tenka angry at the Yamainu? Really? Do you think he's angry with us? You needn't worry about that. Thief! Are you alright, young fellow? Stop! That's good. Be more careful. Sorry to come spouting drivel again. Kiiko won't leave me alone. The others are constant visitors. They take me out for walks and picnics. But I wish they'd just leave me alone. What's their problem? Nothing better to do? But I know that they do care for me. I've become half-paralyzed from the battle and my old friends decided to look after me. My face is half-paralyzed, too. I do stretching in the mornings, or I can't smile properly. But Orochi's dead and the prison is closing down. I'm past my use-by-date. I don't want to be a burden to them. I should have died fighting Orochi. That's why you've been so sulky. A foolish man. Sosei. I haven't seen you since we finished off Orochi. Why would you say I should have died fighting Orochi? Especially in front of your parents' graves. You're the last person I wanted to overhear me say that. Do you come here often? Well, yes. What about you? I vowed not to come until we killed Orochi. That sounds like you. You speak in catchphrases. Sorry, I was wrong. Wrong about what? For quitting Yamainu, or being complicit in the Orochi experiment? Or saying silly things at your parents' gravesite? For stealing my sweets long time ago? You have much to apologize for. You're right. I'm upset because you think you need to apologize. I said I was sorry. Must you apologize for the road you chose? I have no regrets, but still... I should have told you about the experiment. You should have. Then I forgive you. Orochi's gone, my mission as Sosei Abe is complete. You and I have no more bonds to bind us. I'll begin a new life. Very impressive. You're always so measured. You could learn from him, Tenka. It's been a while. What are you all doing here? Why are you in dress uniforms? Kiiko, you never said anything earlier. I did try to tell you. But now you're here, it's perfect timing. It was Sosei's idea, anyway. Sosei Abe, leader of the Yamainu unit formed to destroy Orochi. Seiichiro Takamine, sub-leader. Kiiko Sasaki, member. Mutsuki Ashiya, member. Zenso Inukai, member. Chenran Shi, member. Rakucho Takeda, member. Tenka Kumo, member. We eight come to report the completion of our mission to destroy Orochi. As of now, the Yamainu unit is officially disbanded. Master, did we do well? Did we follow your example of serving and protecting the nation? Since you passed, we have scrupulously followed your teachings. I can report a successful mission without losing a single member. And that was all because of what we learned from you. I'm so proud, sir. Master Taiko Kumo. We are forever grateful. Tenka. Surely you have something to add? Father, Mother. Did I do my best? The pain was agonizing. It was an ordeal. No matter how much I cried, or screamed, you never came. How could I possibly have done any better? Listen. I tried so hard. Soramaru. Chutaro. You did good work. No matter what anyone says, you're the best in the world. You really are. Why are you here? Because you're here. Why are you crying? Because you're crying. No, wait. Don't just walk away. Never doubt your worth when you have such faithful brothers in arms. Don't say that. Let's go home. We're having beef hot pot. Nishiki is preparing it. What did you just say? Soramaru? Hurry up, or it'll soon be dark. Away! We'll go first. This is dangerous. Before I realized it, they'd grown to be fine young men. Mom and Dad! I'll be back. Definitely! Directed by Tetsuya Wakano I told you not to drink. Why not? I'm celebrating my new life. Tenka, please don't go. I shall depart. There's so much to see and explore out there. Are you sure about this? No choice. He'll never change his mind. Will you be alright alone? I'll get by, somehow. I'm going with you. I wanted to travel alone. You'll need someone to take care of you. Enjoy being under her thumb. Prepare for it. You make a great couple. But I decide all destinations. Yes, sir. Where will you go first? Let me see. What's wrong, Tenka? I wonder where he is by now? We all wonder. Sire, we're ready to leave. Good work.
