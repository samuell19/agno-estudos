Today I'm going to talk about John Nash. In 1945, the Second World War ended. Nazi Germany was in ruins and two great powers fought over the remains: US and the Soviet Union - capitalism and communism. Two ideologies that could not be reconciled. A new war seemed to be breaking out and now there was a new weapon: The atom bomb. A weapon so destructive that neither could use it, but both had it. Could they undertake not to deploy it and learn to trust each other? No. Of course they couldn't. This is where Professor John Nash comes into the picture. The world's smartest man. His starting point was that everyone is egoistic and behaves selfishly. Nash had a theory - the Diamond Theory. You've stolen the world's most expensive diamond ... and want to sell it. You make a deal with a gangster. You bury the diamond in one place - - he buries the money in another. Then each goes in his own direction. If you've got any sense, you haven't buried the diamond ... ... and you go to see if the money's there. At best, you now have both money and diamond - - or at worst the diamond. No matter what happens, you can't lose. If you think that everyone is acting selfishly ... ... and shafting each other ... ... you become stronger. If you get ripped off, you're left standing there with nothing. Nash knew that everyone thinks of himself. It saved the United States from having atom bombs dropped on their heads. The end. -Thank you. That was fascinating. - I've got more ... Go and sit down, please. - Shouldn't I take questions? - What questions? Go and sit down. It's probably not clear to everyone. It's about all of us. We're going to annihilate each other. Do you understand? Shut up! He's right. I want to kill him. - You're ruining my life. - No, your dad is. - Why do we have to move? - We can't afford to stay here. - Can't we go to the bank? - I wouldn't get a loan, I freelance. - Get a permanent job. - Nobody has that now. I would have had one, but I got pregnant. - So it's my fault? - If you want to exaggerate, then ... - I don't want to change school, I've learned everything about everyone. - Malte, we can't afford to stay here! - But I've finally started to feel at home. It's probably your fault. - What's my fault? - That we have to move. - What? - You made Dad unhappy. - Have you seen him lately? He doesn't seem particularly unhappy. Well-fed, more like it. Well-fed and happy. - Well, yes. That reinforces the theory. - I'm so tired of your theories. Now this is where we're going to live. End of story. - Do you like your room? - 'Spose so. It's okay. There are guards in place. Why? What are they guarding? Interesting. We are now testing the proposition: ... other possible outcomes of the Battle of Waterloo. Napoleon was strong. Much stronger than his enemies. It was also his great weakness. Napoleon believed he was immortal. But no-one is. The enemy rallied. Napoleon was stronger than all of them individually... ...but not against all of them at the same time. Napoleon's weakness was his boundless arrogance. - And his height. - No. Sure, he had a complex about being short. Come and see what I've done. - I'm busy with something here. I've put a lot in order. But it's not just about what you do for yourself. It's also about what you do for others. - Or about what you think I don't do for you? You need to go out and get some fresh air. And if I refuse? - Then I melt down your tin soldiers and make them into earrings. - Maximum twenty minutes. - Come back when you've got a friend. - I don't want a friend. - Everyone needs friends. - Not me! - Especially you. It's not your time yet. It's ours. Whose time? Your patch. Don't play dumb. Are you new around here? You're not part of our gang. In any case, you'll have to wait your turn. Hey! Wait! - Don't you get it? You're not allowed here! Stop him! - Our gang has the barn now. - Omar won't like this. What happens if I go in? It'll be the worse for you. You know what? If he wants to go in, let him. Good luck. Wow! Sorry, Omar. He wouldn't listen. We told him not to go inside. What should we have done? Ok, I can hear you. Take the hat off. - Who are you? - My name's Malte. - What are you doing here? - Don't know. - You're lying. - No, that wouldn't do me any good. - Are you a spy? - Who for? William, get the knife. Seriously, do we have to do this? No, not the onions ... What the hell are you doing? It's not working, Omar. Get the shit. - Am I supposed to eat it? - Good guess. Okay. Come on then. Stop! - You don't know anything. - Are you sure? - Otherwise you'd have squealed. - Are you quite sure? Let him go. -Don't do that again. - Don't do what? Malte! Come on! Time to wake up. Malte! - Have you eaten everything? - Yes. - Didn't you think about me? - No. - What are you doing? - Writing a shopping list. - Are you going to the shops? - No, you are. - I'm too young for responsibility. - You can clean up here instead. Or do the shopping if you want to. Give me the list, then! Not again! - I don't know anything. - Take off the hood! - We haven't asked anything yet! - What is it now? - What did you say to Omar? - Nothing. - How can we be sure of that? - I don't know anything. Is this a joke? - Does this look like a joke? - It looks like nail scissors. - What do you think it's used for? - For cutting nails. What do you think's going to happen now? - Don't talk to them. - But they're only here to look scary. That doesn't work when you're already scared. - Don't interfere. - Did you eat the dog shit? - Yes. - You're lying. - What do you think? - Don't believe that! You live on my patch, so listen. I make the decisions. - What decisions do you make? - I'll show you. We're changing guard now. - Yeah yeah. - This patch is ours. The other one's Omar's. - What? - Thats how it is. We hate each other. - Of course. To begin with, we hated each other from a distance. - But then came the skatepark. We set up a checkpoint you have to pass before you get in. When we're in the skatepark... ...they can't be anywhere near. Otherwise they're punished. Hard as fuck. Leyla... Leyla!! What now? It's moving. - What are you babbling about? It's loot now. Where are you going? - Loot! - So it's ours now? - Soon. First we check the barn. Come on! - Why haven't you left the barn? - I was listening to my music. - It's true, I didn't hear. - Speak up! - Please, don't do that. Please! - Okay, fuck off! - She was just about to piss herself. You'd have let her do it. - That's disgusting. - But now she's running off home crying. The enemy doesn't care That's what little kids do, isn't it? They whine. It'll be something else if she gets home with her pants soaked in piss. Then something terrible must have happened. Something she doesn't want to talk about. You have to give the impression you're worse than you really are. The enemy's doubts work in our favour. You need me. - What do we do about the new kid? Is he a threat? We wait and see. Wait for my instructions Have you heard of the Cold War? That's what we have here. We are at war. We are, even if it doesn't feel like it. We have one area we're fighting over. - We haven't fought for a long time. - No, you've signed a peace treaty. But the war isn't over You have to assume that the enemy still wants to fight. They have to be afraid of what we can do. - Like the dog shit? - Yes. We have to have something to threaten them with - We've got the nail scissors. - How long since you used them? - They're scared of them. - They soon realise that these are empty threats. If you're going to use nail scissors as a threat... ..you have to be prepared to cut someone's arm. Okay. You get ONE chance. That's all I need. But I need your help. Hello. Haven't you done the shopping? I haven't had time. - What are we going to eat? - Come in. I didn't say it wasn't done. - Who... - I've made some friends. - That's not what I meant. Then you have to be more specific. Laws of Warfare Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori You're drive along a narrow road. Another car is coming towards you. You can't pass each other. The only options are: Both slow down and stop - Or one goes off the road leaving it clear. What do you do? Do you leave the road... ...or take the chance that the other guy does? The safest thing is to do it yourself. But if something was at stake? Your pride? Isn't it cooler to keep going? Sure. But do you dare take the chance... ...that you both won't think the same? The answer is simple. You speed up. Drive faster than him so you know what type he is. - Fuck off. I'll beat you up if you don't! - Go on then. - Fuck off!!! You have to hope you can give way if you need to. If you're afraid, so is your enemy. My nose ... Now it's important to find out what they're afraid of. - Leyla! - What are you doing here? - There's nothing to discuss. - I didn't want a little brother. - I have to keep watch. - Just do as you're told. Why is it called sausage and bread? And hamburgers ... Why isn't it called meat with bread? - Because it comes from Hamburg! - But sandwiches ... - It's time. She's on guard alone. Now's our chance. - Want some? - No, listen up. You have to do as I say. Okay? Okay, there she is. Now we do it. - You shouldn't be here! - Why not? - You shouldn't be here! - "You shouldn't be here ..." - Stop right now! - "Stop right now!" – Na-na-na-na ... –- Little bastards! Stop there! Keep an eye on him. - Hello? - Your baby is gone. - What? Who are you? - Look for yourself. What are you saying? Hello? Hello?! Bertram! Where are you? Bertram! Leyla! I give you responsibility for 20 minutes! I don't understand! I didn't mean it ... -"Didn't mean it..." Do you understand what you've done?! - Now let's look together! - That's not necessary. My little friend! - Where was he? - An old man had the pram. But I said it wasn't his and he ran away. - Thank you. Next time he might not come back. - You pig. Just remember that. Leyla, you and I aren't done. I think her mother is angry. - Perhaps. But you just made a girl sad. - So? - Why doesn't she do something? - She's scared of what I might do. She'll never be a problem for us again. Jeez! - She's totally weird. - She's just scared. - You're cruel. - I want to be a strategic consultant. -That sounds exciting. Quiet! I hereby appoint Malte as our strategic consultant. - But.. what does that mean? - That he makes plans and gives us orders. Doesn't it? - So.. what happens now? - Have you got a plan? Yes. There's no point in sharing the skatepark. We take it over completely. - Hey, Malte, your friend's here. - What? - You said you'd made friends. - Where? - In your room. - You don't let anyone in there! - But... Malte! - What the fuck are you doing here? - Nice posters. - What the hell... - I know what you're doing. You're trying to take power away from me. - I want to win the war. - That's dumb. There isn't a war here. - We're at war. What else would you call it? - John Nash ... - He's a genius. - Are you sure about that? - Yes. He won the Cold War. - John Nash had invisible friends... ... and was afraid of things that weren't there. Everything he's known for appeared... ... before the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. - He wasn't wrong. - Whatever the world looks like, we can't do anything about it. - It's a shame to focus on the negative. You'd have become a good ally. - Isn't that often the case with enemies? Up and down now. Hurry! Up and down! Don't you want to be a good soldier? Faster! We're going to be good soldiers. The enemy never sleeps. Hurry up! We should be physically superior... ...but the most important thing is in here. How do you defeat the enemy without violence? By anticipating their next move. You can't know before they know themselves. Then you have to be cynical. Stop! You mean psychic? - That's it. - Of course you can. Everything can be figured out. I know how you'll react. How? You're afraid of getting fat... ...but you can't stop eating. You think you won't get fat... ... if no one sees you eating. You do what everyone tells you... ... so you're a good foot-soldier. But you can't handle conflict... ...so you can't make up your mind. - What about? You're in love with Fritz. But you don't dare admit it, because you don't think he's in love with you. Fuck off! - Fuck, how unnecessary was that! - Let's go! Why were you so mean? Was it necessary? No. But it's important for you to know the value of knowledge. We'll record everything they do... ... and compare it to what they say they do. We'll get to know them properly. Omar has to be isolated. A general is nothing without his army. Go on. See if you can find something. You're good. -Tell me something. - What about? - Your new friends. - It's confidential. Surely there's something you can tell me? Your mum? If you want me to meet other people... ...,you have to accept that I don't tell anything. Okay. This is what Omar's gang threatened. They did this. - Interesting. Of course, if they never do what they threaten... ... is there anything to be afraid of? We need to frighten them. That'll get expensive. - How expensive? = As in "everyone pays" expensive. - Mum'll be angry - Why should you have our money? - War costs money. - Then I don't want anything to do with it. - Then move. - But we live here. Pay up now, shrimp. We need empty tubes with lids, saltpetre and some other stuff. - Where can we find that? - Who's salty Peter? What? What are you talking about? Saltpetre is a chemical substance. You can make bombs with it. Wicked! - What are you going to do with it? - Make bombs. No, we're doing a physics experiment. - Aren't we going to make bombs? - Shhh!! No. I'm not selling anything to you. If you want to buy that, you have to come with your parents. Hey you- Don't touch that! I said don't touch! Now you have two choices. Sell ​​the stuff to us or be accused of violence against minors. You decide. Should we look for some saltpetre? - What sort of bomb is it? - A smoke bomb. - So it doesn't blow up? - No. It just smokes. - Why? - That's all we need. - We should scare them as much as possible. - No. Only as much as we need to. We show them we can go far, but not how far. Fear is ammunition. - You really talk sooo crazy. - Perhaps. But I'm right. - Here. We need five of these. It's a detonator. - What are we waiting for? - 'Til the time's right. - When's that? - When they come. - We couldn't be more prepared. - Wait a little longer. - You're afraid. - You don't know what you're talking about. - Give it to me. - No! No! - Give it to me! - You can't do that. Wow. Yes! We did it! Malte, you did it! - Nobody hurt. - Now it's ours? - Maybe - Only maybe? - We have to see how Omar retaliates. - We take the barn! - If Malte wants to wait, we wait. - War is just for the patient. - Was that it? - Yes. They've taken over the barn. We have to get even. Your mum doesn't lock the door. - You can't be here! - You think we're scared. - You should be. - I'd rather have peace. - There is no peace. What if everything you believe in is wrong. That John Nash was wrong. Until the Cold War... ...Nash's view of humanity was tested on several different people. Did they always put themselves first? - Yes. Not all of them. In some test groups, they refused to stab each other in the back. They wanted to resolve conflicts through collaboration. According to them, man was good and thus broke the code. If you believe man is good, Nash's theories are worthless. - And are you doing it now? - I'm trying to. - I don't believe you. - Come to the graffiti wall tomorrow and I'll show you. But man is evil. - Why? - Otherwise, the books are wrong. And books are never wrong. - Follow me. - Are you kidnapping me? - No, we're playing. - Omar, this feels weird. Hello, Omar? - You're afraid of the dark. That's okay. - Yes, but I'm not afraid. What's this? Holy shit! Come on, I've something to show you. Wow. Isn't it strange? We live by the water, but when did you last see the sea? This is something completely different. Maybe we can get rid of the checkpoint and build something else. - So you get the skatepark? - You still don't believe me, do you? What the fuck, bastard! wait! Come on then! Hey, what are you doing here? Stop! Stop! Little fuckers, you shouldn'tbe here! - Quick, up here. - You hear what I'm saying? - Stop right now! - Come out now. I know you're there. - Shit. - I know you're here. - Now! - Bastard kids! Little fuckers, stop! Holy shit, that was close! - Are you convinced? You don't win a war with games. - Does it have to be war? - The theories— We're kids, stuff your theories. It doesn't matter, anyway. That old guy looked so funny. You know, that guard. - Yeah. I have to go. See you. - Thanks. But now you have to give this up. - Where the hell have you been? - Nowhere. - You're lying. - I was at the cinema. -vWhat did you see? - A documentary. - About what? Rain? - About how economic progress affects modern warfare in the Third World. - Look me in the eye. Are you lying? - No! - Can I go now? - You have to come up with a new way to destroy Omar. We are at war! - We've won, haven't we? - No, he's free! - You want to kill him? - No, but ... can we make more bombs? - It's not just about destroying. - I want to blow something up. Make Omar piss himself in terror. - Maybe you're on his side? - No! - Prove it then. What if everything you believe in is wrong. That John Nash was wrong. Omar will piss himself in terror. If you believe in the good, Nash's theories lose their meaning. Are you still awake? Does it matter? Yes. It's night-time, you should be sleeping. It's the weekend. I'm not doing anything. So technically, it doesn't matter what I do. You're still my little guy, huh? Shouldn't we just say good night now? Yes, but you need to turn it off now. It's late. Come on. Over here! - We have a problem. - We? - It may be like you said, that there's going to be peace. - But to stop the war, you have to let Mira win. - I can't do that. - Yes you can. The war doesn't matter. Does it? - It does. Why do I have to come now? - We knocked out Omar's guards. So you show you're the better leader. - Well I am! - Yes. You used to be their enemy... ...but now you're becoming their hero. This is going to be a disaster. Omar won't protect you now. The skatepark isn't yours. We're in control. - You can use it, but we make the decisions. - No! Once an enemy, always an enemy. You have to stay away. Forever! Attack! - What the hell are you doing? We had a plan. - A loser's plan! - They're scared. - Just as you said they would be. - You were supposed to become a hero, not an enemy. She fell. - She was by herself, then suddenly - wham! Sister, this doesn't look good. She needs to go to hospital. Right, now I've got to beat you up! What you've done here is shit! - I have to find Omar. - Hold on. - We have to stop this. Omar... you've got a friend here. - Not now, I ... - We have to talk. Do you want something to drink? Tea? - Go away, Mum. - Okay. - I didn't know anything. - We have to hit back. - Impossible. We have to stop the war. We have to try. Mira is completely crazy. It's too late. - What have you done? - Promise not to tell. -Shit! What happened? - There's glass all over the ramp. -I can see there's something bothering you. - What could that be? - I don't know. I wonder if I've pushed you into something you don't want. To make friends, maybe.. Are you friends at all? Is someone bullying oyu? - You think it's your fault. - I don't know. I just want you to be happy. - I'm doing fine. - I can see you're unhappy. Mums see everything. If anyone's being stupid, you have to tell me, so I can kill them for you. Talk to me. Where the fuck have you been? You have to come up with a reprisal. Worse than what he did! We have to stop. Fuck that! He's scattered glass everywhere! Omar's a psychopath! - I can't. - Then you're no use to us. She wants to make bombs. Real bombs. - And she knows how to do it? Not good. We have to get rid of her. - We can't do that. - What else can we do? - We have to have peace. We've got to try. Why does it haveto be so secret? - So Mira can't hear us. - She'll go crazy if she finds out. - You're afraid of her. - She's sick in the head. - What if there's a better way? - Better than what? - Than bits of glass and bombs. There's a better way. Peace. - Peace? Where's that going to come from? From all of us. Including Omar. We can't join forces with the enemy. They want to crush us. - Tina wants the same. Does he want that? - Yes, Fritz wants peace. If you do. I don't know. Everyone wants to be able to walk freely in the street... ...and be in charge of their own life. - I thought you said we can't trust anyone? But now we have to? - Hello. - Hello. I just came to say... that I was wrong. I thought we had to beat the others... ... but maybe that was wrong. Maybe we should just stop. We should just stop. End the war. Stop doing nasty things to each other. No one should be afraid. Everyone wants to avoid that. Bravo! - Well said. - I mean it. - No. You just want to be in charge. You get it? He's not your friend. Malte has no friends. Nobody likes him. He's weird. He tells lies. Is he be the one you want to lead you? - I don't want to lead anyone. - You won'thave to either. Get him! - Let go! What're you doing? Stop! Let go! Now! What are you doing? You're afraid of her. Hello! Someone turn the lights on? Can someone just switch on the lights? Please! Screw that fucking skatepark. - You're paranoid! I've got good reason to be! You do realise Malte's a terrorist? Go away. Leave us alone. Malte... What went so badly wrong? You could have had everything... ...but you didn't want anything. Just peace. - That's what everyone wants. Do you think I want to share the skatepark with Omar again? I don't want peace. I want more bombs. Guys! Do you feel sorry for him? It's him or us. We just have to choose. You don't have to do what she says. - Shut up! Say you're wrong. Admit you're scared! Again. Shit. What have they done to you? - I told Mira to be nice to you. - We'll go back to the old agreement again. Divide the turf. It was better before. - The same agreement? - She gets more time, but it doesn't make any difference. We get peace. - That isn't peace. We only found Omar, tied up. Sure, so where did Malte go, then? We couldn't find him. - How could that happen? - I don't know. You! You're gona pay for this! What are you waiting for? - Don't know. - Where are we going then? - You have to find him, for fuck's sake! Man is a brute. We believe we are civilized and empathetic. But we're not. We are simple. We are selfish. If someone hurts us, we want revenge. In one experiment, someone was given an electric shock... ... for a wrong answer to a question. The people administering the shocks were hesitant. They felt sorry for the victim. - Tell me what you're doing. - It's nothing. I just want you to know that I'm here, no matter what happens. Where are you going now? But they changed their mind ... ...if the person behind the glass had been talking badly Then they gave the shocks without hesitating. That's how simple it is to instil hatred in someone. We're not good. And revenge is the only true driving force we have. A prisoner has escaped. He's dangerous. We don't know what hes capable of. We have to find him. Split up into groups. Look everywhere. He can't have gone far. - Where would he run to? - I haven't escaped. - What are you doing?! -Grab him! - That's not a good idea. I filled the boat with bombs. All I need to do is press the button. - Are you going to hurt all these kids? - Why not? - They haven't done anything to you. - No, but you didn't rescue me. - So why should I care about you? - I believe you dare. - There's a difference between belief and hope. - Press it, then. What are you waiting for? Press the button, then. - That's enough! Did you really think I would? Sorry. Sorry, sorry. It's over now. Malte? There comes a time... ...when you have to see things for what they are. You have to rely on your own judgment... ...and settle up with your heroes. We are not created for destruction. But sometimes you need to destroy the old ... ...in order for the new to grow. It's man who destroys the world, ...but he also creates it. John Nash was insane, ...otherwise he probably wouldn't have survived. The rest of us must do what we can... ...to make it bearable for us. We must create peace in the chaos.
