Well, it was sometime in November between three and dawn. I was snuggled up in a Thunderbird coma rekindling things with an old flame. I didn't care if I ever woke up. But Ma Bell kept tickling my dreams from a million miles away. Hey! You! Mister private dick! What time i-- What time is it? What day is this? Well what happened to Wednesday and Thursday? Who am I speaking to? Benny Coughlin? Oh, it better be, Benny. Oh, God, it better be. You owe me. I'll talk to you later! There wasn't much fog in Pedro tonight, but there was enough tuna in the air to feed a litter of kitties. I hadn't been down to the waterfront in a year. And I hadn't seen Benny Coughlin since the war had turned cold. Private Benjamin Coughlin reporting for duty, Sir! Long time. Looks like you grew a couple inches. That's uh... quite a grouping on your jacket. Who ruined that for you? Cigar Armstead. Six months ago. I want you to tell me something, Benny. Why did I drive all across town in the middle of the night? Charity. Charity? I don't need any charity, Benny. I live in Bel Air. I know that stuff, but it's not for you. Something came in on a tramp steamer from New Guinea last night. A potato sack full of heaven. Ain't I right? No money, no passport, no nothin'. Says her pop lives here. But I can't clear it 'til someone claims her. What do you think, we'd be a cute couple? No. But I'll spill a couple of days for expense for that. Sniff down her daddy, okay? You'll spill? For old times' sake. I am Raffinerio Monaleamera. I will, how you say, interpret? That's, uh, that's how we say it. Uh, why don't you start with your name? Call me Mr. Mona, if you wish. Is that, uh... tribal stuff? Sorry, not. I received first one fairly in fight in Rangoon brothel. Inflicted other one myself. For symmetry. Please, remove your bonnet and douse your tobacco. You're in the presence of perfect innocence. - Sit down. - Ooofff... So what makes you think your old man's in Angelino? [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] What happened to Mom? I'm afraid the mother died in the long-ago plane crash. The girl survived. She was raised by the Kapauku Papuan people of New Guinea. It took her ten long, hard years to save enough money for passage to your country. What line of work was the old man in? [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] She says she is sure her father was a man of God. Yeah. Well, there's a hell of a lot of gods in this town, but, uh... I'll do what I do. This Bible was his. It is her whole world now. Yeah. She just looks at the pictures, huh? All I got from Benny was some liquor contraband for expenses. Nothing else really to go on. Benny hadn't told me about Mount Mona, either. I couldn't put a finger on it, but something about the overgrown cherub seemed about as fishy as the Pedro wind. Maybe her dad could tell me what it was, if I could ever find him. Say, how about a double of your double finest? Hey, what now, old friend? How you been? Fine. On the house. The best. Say when. Say when. When. - Only the finest, right? - Yeah. - Here you go, baby. - For you, huh? I been striking out all day, might as well include you. You ever see this guy before? Nah. Never saw this guy before. Hope the girl doesn't play piano. You know, it, uh, takes all ten for that. What do you mean? Ten fingers, not nine and a half. - How are your chops? - Aww... Let's go over and give Freddie a little static. What do you say, huh? - Bring the bottle? - Yeah. Let's go. What would I do without you? Listen, tell me, my old skins still back there? Still dried out as ever. Lemme oil them up. Well, we blew up a storm all night. I always do my best thinking in 4/4 time. There's something about bop that loosens the parts of your brain that put the pieces of a puzzle together. But there just weren't enough pieces yet. It was a kick in the pants to sit in again with the boys, but I was never gonna find my man of the cloth in this neighborhood. [REVEREND]: Hello...sinners. Welcome. You don't mind me calling you sinners, do ya? You shouldn't. We're all sinners. That's right, all of us! Me, I'm a sinner! All of us are! Mother, that...that little bundle of joy that's you're holding...is a sinner. I hate to say it. That cute, cuddly bundle of joy is just as guilty of original sin as you and I and every person walking the face of the Earth. Original sin. Let's talk about it. Did you ever poke a stick in the water and notice how it bends right where it meets the water? That's the trickery of the Devil, aha! He'll never let you look at anything straight on, no! You hand him the truth and he'll take it and twist it and bend it! Yet, oh, there are seductions in the water, too. Mermaids with their beautiful siren songs and the hypnotic repetitions of the waves - of temptation. - Where's the rev? Where's the rev? Are you a dick? Freelance. Really. He's home. Been out of whack with a rehash of the malaria. All month. Hasn't been here in a month? Where's home? 8202 Fletcher. South Pass. Thank you very much. I admire your programs. Hell! Yes, in hell! Into the drain, down the pipe, and into the eternal sewers of hell! That's the big stink. Hey, Axi, somethin' smell a little? This is death or bad cooking. Some kind of fish! - I want you to do me a favor. - What? Go call Ralph, have him get the boys... You got trouble on you, right? - Hello! Take care of yourself. - See you. Good man. Death should be just like perfume to a Homicide man, but I don't think Inspector Ralph Waters had ever gotten used to it. It was always plenty thick whenever we met up. We trusted each other enough to drink out of the same bottle, but not much beyond that. You won't find bodies as often behind carved oak and adobe as you do inside the cheap stucco in the rest of the town, but when you do it's never simple why their lives have left them. What stake do you have in this stench, Milt? Come on. I'm working. I was hired on a case to find the Reverend Baskin by his daughter. This is his place. Any news you'd like to fess up? Smells like upstairs, Inspector. I was saving myself the price of breakfast. Dried brains on the wall usually put a damper on my appetite, this morning no exception. I tried thinking of blue mountain lakes of mallard and trout but my mind was fishing in two perfect pools of dark red the lady upstairs had made. It's hard to cut both wrists and do that. I looked across an abyss the reverend had called home. and I saw something that wasn't there. Hey, you! Get out! Well, that's about it. You'll get the paperwork in the morning. - Right. - Excuse me. Put his mug on the wire just for the hell of it. - And? - Baskin's an alias. He was born Rudy Gladstone and used to have a record in St. Lou. Bunco. Arson. He was nuthin' but a skid roadie 'til he supposedly had a vision from...from the Lord. It was probably the DTs. Anyway, he cleaned up his act and was sellin' the pulpit real good, 'til... 'til now. And what about the old hag? Uh, Mrs. Leiderman, former Mrs. Schulz, former Mrs. Debbie, former Mrs. Gladstone, from skid row days. She's working as a janitress in the local JC. Milt, how do you peg what's upstairs? I thought it was Malaria. Oh, no. Jokes aside. I got it figured out as a suicide pact for old times' sake. That's very romantic, Ralph. But I don't buy it. See, I'll buy it for the old guy, but the old lady was too-- Uh, Milt, this is Ted Braddock, the family counselor. - How do you do? - How do you do? Uh, Ralph told me about Dorothy. I suppose it's a miracle she's still alive. She will be very well taken care of. The estate is entirely hers. Hey, what's left of the bundle after taxes? Oh, I'd say in the neighborhood, after taxes, um, I'd say, um, three million. That's a very nice neighbordhood, Ralph. I wish I lived there myself. Nice talkin' to ya. I'll see ya later. You must be one o' them new young breed o' dedicated reporters. Got your ass thrown right out, didn't ya? Well, don't let it break your heart. Why don't you see what you can do with that? Well, I found him. And? And he's dead. Such a shame. Poor girl. He's been dead long? Long enough. Look, there's gonna be some family counsel here and some people with some papers and some things you gotta sign and... I'm gonna go home and go to bed, okay? We thank you very much for what you've done. You should thank me for what I haven't done. Cub reporter got his byline in the afternoon final. I hoped that I hadn't spoiled him. I forged a ship pass and took a stroll down to the rust bucket Dorothy Baskin said she came in on. Had a Filipino name, a Liberian flag, and a cargo of tequila from Burma. The Norwegian first mate read the ship pass upside-down. I gave him a fin and he even held the hatch open for me. For the promise of a sawbuck he told me it took them 25 days to cross the Pacific. Would've been sooner if not for a stop in Catalina to load additional cargo. Something packed in burlap, maybe. South Pass Police. Uh, Inspector Ralph Waters, please. Need to tell him. Yeah, I'll wait. Uh, hello, circulation desk. Speaking. Yes, uh, I'm tryna-- Listen, I'm, uh, crammin' for an exam in Anthro 105 and I really need two books and I think somebody's got them out. - Can you help me? - Titles, please. Yeah, one is called The Amorous Islands, and the other is called The Kapauku Papuan Indians of New Guinea. Hold a minute, please. Yeah. I'll wait. - Yeah. - Ralph! Listen, it's Milt! Did you ever find out which school the old hag scrubbed for? What do you wanna know that for? 'Cuz I want the job! It's honest work. It won't hurt you. Lemme see... - Tarzana Community College. - Tarzana Community College. Okay, thanks. Listen, did you guys ever figure out how the old dame slashed both of her wrists and didn't get any blood on herself? Hmm? Think about it. - Sir? Sir! - Yes? They're both overdue. - Checked out by a Thelma Dolbrook. - Thelma Dolbrook. Do you know where I can find her? Yes, she lives at Phi Sigma Kappa sorority house. Phi Sigma Kappa... Do you know where-- - Yeah, I know where it is. Thank you very much. [GIRL]: I don't believe it! [GIRL]: Hey, what's your name? [GIRL]: Come up and get us! [GIRL]: Come up and get us! [GIRL]: Agnes, no! Are you kidding? [GIRL]: They're gonna know my bra size now! You filthy animals! Get outta here! Get outta here! Go on! I'll kill ya! I'll tack you boys to the ceiling by your eyelids! And I'll get you a dull knife to cut yourself down! Don't ever come back! Hey, look, uh, look, I'm sorry. Hey, lemme, lemme just hold these for you. Is this the Phi Sig building? - Yeah, this is it. - Okay, thanks. - You can have these back now. - Okay. Thelma flunked out. Oh, over a month ago. To get hitched to some carnival worker. Oh, yeah. That face, my God. Here it is. Oh, the youth of today. The moms of tomorrow. And, um, thank you very much for this-- You! Get out of here! I'll skin your fanny raw! So Thelma Dolbrook had taken a walk with overdue library books and a big ugly Polynesian fella. Mr. Mona was tall enough to peek in her window at night and he had a face that would give Medusa a nightmare. There couldn't be another one on this planet. Something was rotten in the Dutch East Indies and the stink had started in this room Look at this pigsty! That damn witch of a cleaning woman hasn't been around for a month of Sundays. That, uh, cleaning lady... She ever say anything about her background? Ha! Christ on a shingle! She never stopped yappin' about how that bogus preacher she married slipped her out of a big fat will. That's all I wanna know. And how he'd come in and rendezvous and coochie-coo her a little bit. But he never ever touched-- That's all I wanna know. I'll bet she's on the toot with him right now! But believe you me, if I ever get a hold of her ass, there's gonna be fireworks! If you get around the morgue any time around the 4th of July, you ought to do pretty good. Thank you very much. What? - This is the end of the line now. - Is this it? I wanna thank you, man, for your, uh, transportation and your philosophy. It's important to me. And do me a favor. I want ya to call Ralph. I want ya to tell him it's all laid out here waiting for him. Hey, Milt, I'd like you to do me the same favor, man. Well, I owe ya, I-- Could you just, uh, sneak that in your coat? Sneak it right in there. Just put it right in there. - I bet this was your grandmother's. - Nobody'll see it. Right? Hmm? - Nobody's lookin'. - This is very touching, Axi. - Now please-- - Hey. - Hey. Please. - No. I couldn't do it. I wouldn't know how to run it. I'm not very good at that. And you know what happens when you use guns? You get bullets in your legs, and it costs you a fortune to get 'em taken out. Hey Milt, to tell you the truth, it's never been outta the holster. Looks like a lady's gun anyway. It is. It's my grandma's. Thanks again, partner. See you later, Vinny! Raise your dukes, gumshoe! Make a ninety-degree turn slowly. March. It's no good. Do you know who I am? Heh. You're the man with the gun. Don't crack wise! I'll use it! What are you gonna use it for, huh? - Looks like an ashtray to me. - Stay put! Lemme tell ya somethin'. Before you use a gun, you gotta keep your-- ...mind on it. Remember that next time. Ha! [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] She thanks you and will reward you handsomely from the fortune. Well, that's very nice. Why don't you tell her that she's got a big green booger in her nose. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] You goddamn son of a bitch! Hmm? What is that? An old tribal saying? Drop it, Thelma. Go back to sleep and dream of bullets, Benny. You have at most 30 seconds to live. He's doin' 50 years and the electric chair. You know that. I'm gonna see to it. But I think that you're just about fraud-deep, Thema, isn't that right? Or we could have it fixed up that way. This is a real cute guy, but I don't think he's worth doing a lifetime in the ladies' slammer, now, is he? You are as deep as me, dear. We are both up to here. Shoot him! You got the gun, hon. Shoot him! Thelma, the only thing you've lost so far is a little finger. The rev did himself in. Legitimately. They shamed him into it. The wildman of Borneo here did a bad slice job on the old hag, and everybody knows. Only thirty seconds more! Do you hear that? You hear those? Hmm? They're tolling for thee. You're not gonna use that thing. C'mon. It will give me great pleasure to watch your face at the moment of your first kill. Pull the trigger. Pull the trigger, darling. Oh! Thelma didn't do time for the suicide hoax, but only 'cuz they gave her the gas chamber for Mr. Mona. He guessed wrong about the girl. Maybe he couldn't see the survival in her eyes from way up there. He guessed wrong about the poison he gave Benny, too. It was already 73 seconds. Benny had gotten me into this mess, even if he'd tried to get me out at the cost of his life. I owed him. How was I gonna pay? Benny, Benny... I want a hero's burial, Sarge. Promise. I want all my medals. I gotta bail out. Sorry. I can't-- I can't wait much longer. Gimme five. Five volleys. Gimme a volley of five, please. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. I'm gonna go soon, I'm-- Hey, gimme one more for old time's-- Benny? Benny?! Kimchi, Benny.
