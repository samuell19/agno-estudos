(dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) - [LeClerc] This is the island of Majorca. Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs coveted its important position and each took possession of it. But now the tide of history has turned, and holiday makers from all over the world come to Majorca. As Majorca takes possession of them as it has of me. But even in the Garden of Eden there was a serpent, and one has reared its head in this garden of mine. Urgent business. I must fly back to Paris. (atmospheric orchestral music) So I am saying au revoir to the blue Mediterranean that carries the one great love of my life, my ship, Le Cygne, The Swan. How can I leave all this beauty? I will be back. Miseur, you always come back to Majorca. Hasta la vista. (dramatic orchestral music) (seagulls squawking) (water bubbling) (water splashing) (atmospheric orchestral music) (water bubbling) - Senorita? - Huh? Oh, gracias. - De nada. - Sorry, no comprendo. - Did you dive from the cliff? - Ah, it was higher than I thought. - You are the first lady I've ever heard of to make that dive. - And the last, I should hope. It was a crazy thing to do. - You'll excuse me for speaking to you like this, a stranger. - Perfectly alright. - May I? - Of course. - You are perhaps a champion diver? - No, I've done quite a lot of swimming. - Then you're not a professional? - Professional model. New York, Paris. You understand what that means? - Of course. You are on a holiday? - Uh-huh, on my vacation. - And your husband? - I'm not married. I made the trip alone. A girlfriend of mine was coming with me, but her boyfriend objected. - And your boyfriend? - I, are you, by any chance, with the Spanish FBI? - I am sorry if I have offended you. - Don't be. My name is Anne Traymore. - I am Manuel del Rio Montoya. You like to swim very much? - Mm-hmm. - I have swum since I was two. Two meters like walking. The means of getting to someplace, but skin diving, spear fishing, to explore the world under the sea, ah. - And your girlfriend? Does she ever go along? - I have no girlfriend. - I haven't been spear fishing since last summer. - Would you be free tomorrow morning? - My time is my own here. - Good, I have all equipment onboard. - Onboard? - On Le cygne, The Swan. - You have a lovely boat. - Is it not? - Very beautiful. (dramatic orchestral music) (water splashing) (water bubbling) (boat whirring) - Look at that one? That's my baby. - Le Cygne. - French boat. - Quite a skiff. What do they do to a guy for stealing a boat like that? - Stealing, who's stealing? I'm talking about borrowing. - What about the boat you borrowed from under the noses of the shore patrol? - Well, I was a lot younger then. You know, that boat will take us anywhere we wanna go. Come on, let's go over close and take a look. (water bubbling) (atmospheric orchestral music) - They got jails here, you know. - There's nobody around. (atmospheric orchestral music) (water bubbling) The owner really spends money on this baby. Look at the way she's kept up. - Yeah, sure, come on Joe, let's go. You know, in Spain they might make you walk the plank. - Relax, Ernie, relax. - Anybody home? (water bubbling) (dramatic orchestral music) (Ernie whistling) Okay. Wow. (humming) - Well what do you think of this? - Hey, when you find out who goes with that, let me know, will you? Don't I look divine? (perfume hissing) Hey, come on. - Ship log. Ah, a Parisian owns this boat. A Mr. Rene LeClerc. An exporter. Dames, dames, dames, wow. There sure have been a lot of them on this ship. - I hate to interrupt your reading, pal, but you know-- - Yeah, I might take this along with me. There's nothing like a good book to relax you. - Yeah. (atmospheric orchestral music) (tank thudding on deck) Well, hello. - Hello? - There was no one around, so we were just looking it over. Is she for charter? - I don't know, you'll have to ask the owner. - Hello there, my name's Joe Balfour. This is my friend Ernie Williams. - Manuel del Rio Montoya. - Oh, you're not French? - French, no, Majorcan. Gentlemen, this is Senorita Anne Traymore. - A pleasure. - Does she go with it? - What's that? - Oh, ah, private joke. A compliment, I assure you. We like your boat very much. Do you ever charter her? - No, never. But I have two other ships that might interest you. - Two other ships? - Not so fine, of course. If you gentlemen are interested, you might have cocktails with me at El Borracha. Say about seven? - Fine, we'd like that. - And I am hoping Senorita Traymore will join us? - Oh, I might be in the way if you're going to talk business. - You could never be in the way. - I think Manuel is right. This senorita would adorn any gathering. Well, adios. Come on, Ernie. (atmospheric orchestral music) - Hey, maybe the French man sold the boat to the kid. - I think he's just putting it on big for the girl. We'll find out in town. I'll meet you at the El Borracha. - Fine, except that I'm out of scratch. Hand me 10, will ya? Hey, that's only five. - So, spend less. - Ah. ♪ I want you to know that I'm going there too ♪ ♪ I'll be by you ♪ Be by you ♪ By you, I'm gonna be by ♪ If you take a dip in a pretty lagoon ♪ ♪ Or if you should flip for a trip to the moon ♪ ♪ I'll be by you ♪ Be by you ♪ By you ♪ I'm gonna by by ♪ Summer ♪ Wintertime and springtime ♪ Have no fear my dear ♪ 'Cause I'll be near - The man who carries my money will be along in a minute.

She don't know it. The kid's taking her for a ride. - Why not? (crowd applauding) (crowd chattering) - Oh, good evening, gentlemen. Sit down, please. - Thanks. Well, you two look like you've been dancing together for a long time. - I wish it were true. - We met yesterday. - Oh, I'd never guess it. But then, you know how it is? - No, how is it? - In the travel folders, blue skies, white beaches, tropical splendor, romance. - Ah, I thought this was supposed to be a business conversation? - Well, it is. Manuel. (Ernie clearing throat) - I don't seem to have a drink. - Oh, excuse me. - Si, senor? - Shall it be tall ones? - I don't know why not. Have you reconsidered chartering Le Cygne? - I'm sorry, but you may charter either one of the other two ships. The Sevilla is fairly large. If I knew what you wanted it for? - Well, it's a pretty tough cruise. It'd take quite a boat. I've seen The Sevilla. It won't do. (customers chattering) Gracias. (upbeat tropical music) To our evening. Manuel, would you mind if I asked Anne to dance with me? - Not at all. - Now if I can just persuade the young lady. Madame. - A funny thing, my glass seems to be empty. - Of course, excuse my negligence. - Manuel, (laughing) I see where I'm gonna like you. - I'll probably be quite a disappointment after that agile Latin. - Would you like a polite answer or the truth? - It's too bad, that kid's really overmatched. Handsome, owns a boat, too. - And young. - Well after I pick myself up off the floor, I'll try to think of something to say. New York? - Yes. Midwest? - Oh, further west. - Model? - Boat bum? - You know honey, one of these days that left of yours is gonna get you in a lot of trouble. You know, I, I'd like to have a little talk with you in private. - I'll bet you would. - Do you read minds? - Some times. - Well you'd be wrong. This is strictly business. About a fortune and how to acquire it. - How interesting. Talk. - I'm serious. This is involves about a million dollars. Only I, I need a boat. - I see. - A particular boat. Should we have that talk say tonight? After you lose junior? Say on the beach below the cliffs? - Let's say tomorrow morning. I never make important decisions at night. (atmospheric orchestral music) - [Joe] Good morning. - You look more natural that way. - Well so do you. May I? - My, such a attentiveness. - Well, I've gotta do something to keep up with Manuel. Pretty? - Very. Heavy, too. - That's pure gold. - A real gold coin. What is it? - Spanish doubloon. Here's its twin. (coins clinking) - And you know where there's lots more of them? - About two, maybe three million dollars worth. Buried in about 50 or 60 feet of water. Not too far from here. - Then why don't you go after them? - [Joe] I need a certain boat, and I need the right gear. - So you want Le Cygne? - For 25%, I think even a rich young man like Manuel would be interested. Whom I can't get to but you can. - What makes you so sure? - Please, you think junior wouldn't be interested in a trip with you into the wild blue beyond? - You don't have a very high opinion of me, do you? - I think you're a very smart girl. (seagulls squawking) - And if I go along? - A four-way split. You, Manuel, Ernie and me. (Anne laughing) Well what's so funny? - Treasure hunt, pirate's gold, and I'm sitting here listening. I've heard some strange approaches in my time, but this tops them all. - You flatter yourself. You think I'd go to all this trouble? - Just for me, you mean? - Yeah, that's exactly what I mean. Ernie and I picked up an ole lugger. We were running freight along the African Coast. One day a couple of big shots came up to us and wanted us to haul some heavy cargo for them. I didn't think the old tub could make it, but they offered a big price, payment in gold. We were broke, so we couldn't turn it down. - Well go on, I'm listening. - The cargo consisted of thousands of these gold coins. Only we didn't make it. We ran into a storm three days out, and we founded off an unchartered island. Ernie and I made it to shore. The others didn't make it. - How did you get off the island? - A commercial airliner spotted us. Several days later a freighter picked us up. A likely story? - Not to. - Doesn't a cruise aboard a beautiful yacht like Le Cygne sound enticing to you?

Calling Paris. - Oh, so nice to be with you again. - (speaking in foreign language) I miss you very much. - Very much. - Champagne, (speaking in foreign language). - Oh, no, no, no. It is an overrated wine. Besides it does not agree with me. - Your usual wine, miseur? - Thank you. - A long distance call for you, Monsieur LeClerc. - Now? Who would be calling me here? (speaking in foreign language) - Oh, ah. - I know you are planning to go on a cruise, but they think it should first go to dry dock for about three weeks. - Dry dock? But I intend on returning to helm at the end of the week. - But Miseur, the motors need to be tuned up, the keel examined, the steering gear adjusted, and the entire ship repainted. - It was painted six months ago. - I am thinking only of your welfare, miseur. I know how proud you are of Le Cygne. - No, champagne (speaking in foreign language). - Make sure they do a good job, Manuel. - Thank you, I will, Miseur LeClerc. - Alright, I will be there in three weeks. Au revoir. Goodbye. - Goodbye. (customers chattering) - Mm, the wine, it is wonderful. - Mm-hmm. (bell ringing) (atmospheric orchestral music) - Have you seen Anne? - No, it's early yet. - But it is getting late. - Why, something bothering you, Manuel? - This cruise, I must return here within three weeks. - Well I guarantee you will. - That will be fine. Do you suppose Anne has changed her mind? - Hmm, not if I know dames. - Don't worry, Manuel, she'll show. - Hello, everybody. - You really moved out bag and baggage. - Take the bags below. Captain's cabin, the large one on the right. - Wait a minute. There are two of us. We thought that we'd bunk in the big cabin. - I'm sorry, it is reserved for Anne. - Manuel's right. - Thank you, gentlemen. - De nada. (dramatic orchestral music) - Oh, boy, look what I discovered. Right from the Rue De La Paix. Oui, oui, miseur, oui, oui, Paris. Hey, no kidding, you oughta get a load of this galley, they got everything. - I mean, that's news to you? - Oh, no, just that I never knew you were quite that smart. Mm. Did we steal a boat? No, we get Manuel to steal it for us. And do we know it's stolen? We do not. And we are shocked to discover that Manuel is not the owner. Just in case the law shows up. And somehow the law always shows up. Mm. ♪ Oh, a capital ship for an ocean trip ♪ ♪ Was the Wallowing Window Blind ♪ (Joe laughing) - I think we're crazy. What if they don't find the gold? - All my life I've been on a treasure hunt. Every time I thought I'd found something, it turned out to be nothing. I've made an awful lot of mistakes. - Who doesn't make them? But with the right company, what's the difference? - Didn't anyone ever teach you as a little girl never to disturb a man at the wheel? Alright, all hands out, look alive. Well, what kept you? - It was my own mother, son. Waving goodbye like. - I'll have no sloppy sentiment aboard my ship. - Aye, aye, sir, Captain Bligh. - Well we're underway and out to sea, we oughta find out how we stand. - What do you mean, Joe? - We've gotta have a captain. I nominate me. Alright with you, Manuel? - Of course, Joe. - I'm a bang up bosun begging your pardon, captain. - You're the cook. - What, with a woman onboard? - Anne will not cook. - We'd probably regret it if she did. Manuel, Anne, you're part of the crew. You mind your manners and you get your regular ration of grog. Agreed? - Agreed. - Agreed. But, um, could we please not have so many bad jokes? - Blimey, that's mutiny, sir. - She's right, Ernie, knock it off. Anne, you wanna take the wheel while we change course. (atmospheric orchestral music) If this wind keeps up we'll make good time and save our diesel oil. - [Manuel] She will keep up, I know it. We have luck aboard. - Hold her in the wind. - Ow. What do you do in your spare time, lift elephants? - He's also known as Popeye the Sailor. (atmospheric orchestral music) - But without a chart, how can you hope to find it? - I've got the chart in my mind. All memorized, longitude, latitude, everything. You just relax, Manuel. I'll get you there. (atmospheric jazz music) - You're beginning to regret this trip, aren't you? - Yes. I will never be happy till I get this ship and you back to Majorca. - Manuel, I'm not a little Spanish girl who's never been away from home. - I should not have agreed to come. But I wanted to be with you, Anne. Let's go back. - But Manuel, what about the gold? - They may find the gold and they may not. We have so little time. You will go back home and forget me. - Is that what you think, Manuel? - That is what I think. It is not what I hope. - Let's go on. Who knows what might happen? (atmospheric jazz music) (atmospheric orchestral music) - Hey, lots of room. Come ahead. Wow. ♪ I gotta be by you ♪ I gotta be by you - Hi. - [Anne] You've known Ernie for quite a while, I presume. - Yeah, quite a while. - [Anne] You're good friends, I imagine. - Sure. Why, what's this all about anyway? - In someway, I just can't connect the two of you. - Oh, Ernie's alright. He's tough when he has to be but he's good natured. He'd jump overboard if I asked him to. - Would he? - Sure, he'd give me the shirt off his back. - With a knife in it. - Honey, he's harmless. - I still wouldn't trust him. - Well, you'd be wrong. - Well just see that he stays away from me. - He's harmless. By the way, thanks for having that little talk with Manuel. He needed it. - He did the talking, I listened. He's worried about one thing, me. - I'd say that you keep him that way. - He doesn't trust Ernie. Or you. - I'm after gold. I've had a lot of dames in my life. But very little gold. (atmospheric orchestral music) - [Manuel] Reporting for duty, captain. - All yours, take over. - Wonderful night. - Making good time, too. (door scraping) (atmospheric orchestral music) - What's the matter, Anne, did I scare ya? - I thought I heard something. - What? - Someone tried my door. - Oh, you know how it is at sea. Things kinda rattle around. Why don't you get in the bunk and get a good night's sleep, huh? Goodnight. - [Anne] Goodnight. (atmospheric orchestral music) - Choice scraps. Okay you fish, come and get it. Good eatin'. Who ya got in the second race? - Just looking around. - Boss, that's some navigator. Looking for the wind? What happened to it? - Dropping. - No, we're gonna hit a calm first. - What do you mean first? - One day in the Pacific, I seen it just like this the day before a big blow. - Yeah, I know, Why don't you get below and fix me some bacon? - Aye, aye, sir. (atmospheric orchestral music) - What's troubling you Manuel? - The same thing that's troubling you. The storm. - Don't worry, we'll ride it out. - I hope so. - Good morning. - Buenos dias, senorita. Well, we got a little bit of everything for you this morning. Flying fish, seagulls, dolphins. Even a storm coming up. - I've seen them before. - Yeah, but this is something special. (ominous orchestral music) - So? - So Manuel's got a long face. He's not only worried about the boat, he's torching for you. He says you say he's only a boy. - What else is he but a boy? - A very rich boy. - Thank you for reminding me. - Hey, Ernie, come on, look alive. Come on, let's get these sails down. (dramatic orchestral music) - Invoices are being mailed, and the shipment will be made especially to you. I think that will do for today, Yvette. Ah, business, business. Necessary evil. - Mr. LeClerc, you asked me to remind you-- - Ah, ah, ah, Yvette, no more. Please, hmm. - To call Manuel. - Ah, yes, of course. Huh, you are a joy, Yvette. Put in the call. - Look at the sea. Those greasy swells. Feel the air. Stagnant. There isn't a breath of wind. If this keeps up, well I have the feeling we'll never get back in time. - Manuel. - You fellas don't care what happens. I do. I'm going back. - Manuel. - I say we turn back right now. - You can't do that, Sonny boy. That's mutiny. - I have something important I'd like to discuss with you. - No, nothing will change me. Nothing. - You don't object to having a little talk with me in private, do ya? - Don't worry, Anne. Joe won't hurt him. - Won't hurt him? You let go of me. - Joe just wants to talk a little sense to him. Be good now. Don't crab the act. (speaking in foreign language) - Your call, miseur. - Merci. Hello, LeClerc here. Manuel? Oh, Rivera. How are you coming along with my ship? You haven't seen it for, oh, wait, now wait. - But, Miseur LeClerc, I have nothing from Manuel. - It's my ship, I say we turn back. - [Joe] What'd you say? - I said we turn back. - No, before you said that. - I said it's my ship. - It's not your ship. I checked up on you. Of course, Anne doesn't know that. And she won't. Unless I tell her. (dramatic orchestral music) - I don't understand. Manuel has disappeared with Le Cygne. - Ah, Senor Montsega. - Rivera, this is an unexpected pleasure. - I talked with you on the telephone. It's very important you call Misuer LeClerc. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Manuel] I never saw the barometer this low before. - What makes it so hot? I can hardly get my breath. What are you doing? - Changing course, heading for the nearest land. You better get below. Alright, batten everything moveable down.

Can renew search for Le Cygne but survival doubtful. Advise. Signed, Montsega. - Care of Montsega, please, continue look for Le Cygne. Inform Coast Guard and advise.

Get onboard. - Why? - [Joe] They're poison, go on, get up there. (dramatic orchestral music) (Joe screaming) (Anne screaming) - Ernie? What can we do? - There are some wild herbs on those islands that will draw out the poison. - Well let's hurry out of here. Do you want him to die? (engine whirring) - Ernie, take it easy, please. - This is ain't no time to take it easy. - You know, I put my finger in a light socket once when I was a kid. It felt just like this. - Try not to talk Joe. - Hey, hey we're clear. - Yes, Joe, we're clear. - What are you looking at? - Nothing, Joe. Nothing. - Now how far are them islands? - Give me the wheel. - Oh, relax. (atmospheric orchestral music) - How is he? - Asleep, but he's kicking around a lot. - Got the leaves? - Yeah. - Man, that stuff's hotter than liniment. - It's helping you. - I've never been so hot before in my life. - [Anne] Here drink this. - Have I got to drink this stuff too? You sure Manuel picked the right herbs? That stuff would kill a jackass. - [Anne] I don't think so. You're still alive. (atmospheric orchestral music) - You got a cigarette? What's the matter? - Nothing, nothing. - Tastes good. It's cooled off a little, hasn't it? - Yes, yes it has.

I must have got mad. - Alright, let's have a happy ship, huh? Come on, tell the kid you're sorry. Come on. (atmospheric orchestral music) That's it, alright. - Are you kidding? - I thought you had a good memory? - What does he mean? - Our own private little goldmine. - I'm not such a bad navigator after all, am I? - All along I thought you two were kidding.

(dramatic orchestral music) Manuel, you better get that skip out of the water, so we can get ready to sail for homeland. - Manuel! (dramatic orchestral music) Manuel. - Joe, it's Miseur LeClerc. What will we do? - Who is he? - Just the guy that owns the boat, that's all. Ah, Miseur LeClerc. - My ship, my beautiful ship. Just look at her. I'll see you go to prison. All of you! Yes, even the young lady. - Ah, Miseur LeClerc. - Yes, yes, all to prison, together silent. - If you would just step down here for a moment. - Ah, I tell you, I will not listen. - Please, Mr-- - Mm, nothing you can say will change my mind. - Look. (LeClerc whistling) (coins clattering) Your ship worked like a good luck charm for us. - Three million in gold. - Three, three million dollars? - Yes, and one-fifth goes to owner of the ship, of course. But actually the credit goes to Manuel. - Well we drink a toast. My finest brandy. (dramatic orchestral music) - How are you gonna spend your share of the loot? - Find a partner and go into the shipping business. - Not a bad idea. - I agree. - Salute. (atmospheric orchestral music) (boat engine whirring) (horn blaring) (dramatic orchestral music) (horn blaring) - [LeClerc] Manuel, what is it? - It's the (speaking in foreign language) The Coast Guard. They've ordered us to stop. - They'll probably send us to prison. - I want nothing to do with the gold. Understand, nothing. - Okay, okay. (dramatic orchestral music) - You and your buried treasure. - Now take it easy, all they can do is confiscate the gold. - All of it? - Well, I could have given the Spanish government 50%. I didn't. Can't win 'em all, honey. I'm sorry. - Joe? - Can't shoot a guy for trying, can they? (dramatic orchestral music) (horn blowing) - We must follow them. - What about our partnership? - Well I think we might be able to find another state. - But no more buried treasure. Promise. - Promise.
