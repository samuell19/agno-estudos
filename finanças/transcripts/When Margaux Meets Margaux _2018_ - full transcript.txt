You lost Respect Toto, you gave me a good licking. How about I lick you for real? Hi. Hi. Bye. Bye. WHEN MARGAUX MEETS MARGAUX Could I get the milk on the side, please? So, your total is 7,95 euros with the M&Ms. Actually, I'll skip the M&Ms. We take credit cards. That's not why. I'm just skipping them. In that case, 2,95 euros. Going to the cow show? Excuse me? Going to the cow show? No. It's just that I am. I thought maybe... you were. Right, but I'm not. Thanks. Got makeup remover? As if! As if I go around with makeup remover. I slept with the kilt guy. As if! You got into his kilt? No comment. - Stop saying "as if." - My little brother's expression. There are pins. You don't unbuckle the straps. Right, a kilt. A kilt. Will you tell Jonas? No way. - Will you tell Jean? - Him neither. Catch the last metro? Somebody had puked. Shit. Just getting your answer now. So, am I right? Yeah, you're right. My break's over. What'll you have? - Coffee with a drop of milk. - Macchiato. No, milk on the side. This is the last time. That? You come 20 minutes late in yesterday's clothes. Something came up. Thanks. It's mine. I don't pay you to text all day. No, you pay me to sell clothes I can't afford on what you pay me. When I'm not feeding the meter for your car. It's ok, no one's here. Come again? I said no one's here. No, before. What'd you say before? Nothing, sorry. You think you can talk to me like that? No. What's with her? Margaux, Margaux! Margaux! Margaux! Jerome? I was afraid I wouldn't recognize you. You won't need it at the funeral. Is the metro a straight shot? I forget. Just one change. Shall I? No, it's fine. I'll deal with it. Are you married? Any kids? - Four. - Four? Give me one! You haven't changed. What are their names? Lucas, Nathan, Pauline and Celeste. Give me Nathan. You love him less, right? Were you still in touch with her? How'd you find out? Jocelyne Le Senechal told me. They were close. Jocelyne... She used to put salad in her mashed potatoes, yuck! Actually it's delicious! Two contrasting textures. When you mix them... Never mind. I can explain, weird though it is. Show me your purse. It was this. Is Jonas here? No, he went for lunch. He won't be long. You can wait in the stockroom. The stockroom? There are chairs, a coffee machine. As you like. Or come back later. Ok, I'll wait. Tomorrow you'll sing Tomorrow you'll dance Tomorrow your velvety feet Will tread the immaculate ground Of the great white land The great white land Tomorrow they'll take your hand And spin you around Tomorrow you will be loved As you have never before been loved... What's with you? I don't like death, I hate it. No one likes it. But some can stand it. Not me. I can't take the grave, coffins, shoveled earth... I'm afraid of not crying, or crying too much. Crying more than my relationship to the deceased warrants, because... I'm frightened by my own death. Or by other people's grief. Or I picture myself... in that hole! We all feel the same. You don't. You cried just the right amount. You're a reasonable guy. I'd barely seen Esther since college. Only at the wedding of... what's-her-name, I forget. How do I get out of this damn cemetery? Go on back, you'll miss the drinks. It's not a party! Elodie and Lou have gotten so fat I desperately need to change... my life How's it going? Seriously, who wears this? Not us. - You stole junk. - It was calling out to me! They're on to me now. Hopefully Jonas will dump me. Dump him yourself. I don't get it. I don't know how. And he insists I take up violin again. That's not enough. I can do that. Go back to the violin. No. - Go back to ballet. - Nope. Go back to your Master's. No can do. Impossible. Why? No fucking way! You slept with him. You slept with Gallais? And you didn't tell me. I was ashamed. But he was nice. What advisor who sleeps with his student is nice? He is, Gallais. I swear. He didn't make me feel like shit. I did anyway, though. You're messed up. Sorry, but you really are. I got flowers. Ever gotten flowers? How pathetic. Flowers! Jealous. As if! I never saw any flowers here. I gave them to Jean. My point exactly. You're truly messed up. Reception, hello. Excuse me, why are there no mini things in the minibar? Mini things? You know what I mean, mini roasted peanuts, mini Toblerones, mini... mini bottles. Too many guests were stealing them. I'm sorry. No room service either? I'm afraid not. Two-star service. Right. Sorry, madam. Madam yourself! Madam! Yes, please. Thanks. The word is merci in Iranian, too. In Farsi. I didn't know that. It's true. Whatever. Margaux's not here? Is she avoiding me? The world doesn't turn around you. She didn't feel like it. She's got an early train. Are you on your way? Wear anything, nobody's dressed up. Jerome, what's up? Why aren't you here? Call me back. No thanks. I quit 8 years ago. 8 years ago I was 12. - Not me. - What? 8 years ago I wasn't 12. That's for sure. - Hi, I'm Margaux. - Nice to meet you. - All good? - Yeah. Hi. - Are you Bastien's mom? - No, no. Whose mom are you? It's weird to bring your mom. You'd have to pay me 350 euros to bring my mom. I'm no one's mom. I'm meeting a friend of a friend of someone's son. I don't know who. Maybe it's you. Are you the son of a friend of a Jerome? Who needs a room in Lyon for an internship with Bocuse? Who's Bocuse? You'll know one day, sooner than you think. I think I'll be going now. - Goodbye. - Bye. Sorry. Ever heard of Bocuse? Who? Bocuse. That lady's too weird. Sorry, I didn't see you. Shall I unlock it? I got spilled on. Me too. Mine's Spritz. Mine too. Shitty party. I didn't want to come. Me neither. I've got an early train. Me too. Mine's at 6:57. Mine too, 6:57. Gare de Lyon? Are you going to Lyon? Yes. Part-Dieu station. Perrache station. - I'm going to my parents'. - Not me. I'm not going to your parents'! - Course not. - Course not! - Are you Bastien's mom? - No, are you? No, me neither. What a crazy coincidence! Where've you been? Hello, sorry. Let it be known, I'm not Bastien's mom. Me neither. Margaux. Margaux? Margaux? What's with her? My name's Margaux too, is what. Do you live at Maraîchers? Yeah... And she's your roommate? Possibly. You two will lose touch. You'll lose touch with Esther. - And then... - What? How do you know all that? How do you know her name? I was at her funeral this afternoon. Yeah, right. No happy birthday? Right, sorry Ludo. Happy birthday. What's the matter? - Who's she? - Who's she? Stealing? Are you crazy? Never from people. You drank too much. You should be more careful. I don't know. Just in case. I can't find my coat. Take mine, I'll find yours. Who was the weird chick in the bathroom? She's me. Me in 20 years. She doesn't even look like you. You're so pragmatic. I don't expect you to understand. You're imagining things. I'm imagining something real. It's your loose screw rattling around. Right, my loose screw. Ludo offered to take me home. Aha! I see. You're wrong. I hope. Be careful crossing the street. Don't screw up. Margaux! No! No what? Ludo. Don't go home with him. What the fuck? Who the hell is she? Don't do it. Take the metro home. Trust me. Don't go home with him, go home alone. I'm not gonna sleep with him. So you say! But I'm not into him. I wasn't either. I can hear you, by the way. - What's going on? - Your scooter's been stolen. You have no money for a cab and Margaux's bank card is dead. Does you card work? Does it work, Margaux? No. See? Fuck this shit! Fuck that fucking fuck! I hadn't even finished paying for it! Who? Who what? Who's the fucking fuck? The fucking fuck who stole my scooter. Or that bitch of yours. Sorry, it's not you. It is, a little. Fuck this shit! Thanks again. For... Otherwise I get sick. - What? - It's my inner ear. Right, I see. Sorry, I just lost a friend. I need... How'd she die? Excuse me. Well, well! Go back down often? You mean back up. No, back down. We're going down. To Lyon. Still say for Lyon? Yes I do, thanks. I went up to Paris. So I'm going back down. But you'd gone up to Paris... as I recall. That didn't last. I came back down. Quite the little elevator. Excuse me? Never mind. Where are you sitting? Across from a lady who... - Never mind. - Who what? Never mind. Tell me. Who has an inner ear problem. Do you really care? Of course. Still wearing the same perfume. Bohême. Seriously, Marc, is that all you've got? Where are you sitting? Across from Aurélie Dupont. In first class. Seriously? I love her. - Bet you're flirting. - She's not my type. Not your type? Come on. A prima ballerina is everybody's type. - Who doesn't like a liana? - Me. Alright already, sir! Come. I saw you in Coppélia at the Paris Opera when I was little. So... I'd love it if you could sign it... for... Margaux. Do you prefer to Margaux or for Margaux? For, for! It's A-U-X. Not O-T. For is more like you're giving me something. To is... too much. I'm nobody. Nobody is nobody. You are you. Yeah, among others. Among others? How so? Who else are you? Nobody, nobody. Nobody is nobody. Right, you told me. Shall I just sign? Wait, I know. Can I read it now? "For Margaux, a souvenir of a moment spent in the train." Thanks. Is that ok? Sure, it's great. - You seem disappointed. - No, no. Excuse me. Hello. Hello. Hello again. I'm sitting across from you. Oh yeah, right. I'll be going. - Hope you don't mind. - Not at all. I want to surprise her. For Margaux. Great, thanks. See you later. I mean... Excuse me. You're Aurélie Dupont. Yes? It's just that I really like you a lot... For Margaux. Thank you so much. "For Margaux, a souvenir of a moment spent in the train." What's your hurry? - My parents are here. - I remember. I didn't tell you. I remember they picked me up when I moved here. We're late, they're waiting at Conway’s. I'm not moving here. You are. Sorry. What's your hurry? - Know each other? - Know each other? Delighted. I'm Marc, her ex. We met in the bar car. Don't disappear! Is your phone number 06 42 49 48 30? No. It has to be. You're lying. Loan me your phone, my battery's dead. Quick. 2-2-3-3. Sabbatical year from hell. Hello, 06 42. Hello? Hello, seriously? Cool ice thing. Are you rich? I used to be, once upon a time. Were you high voltage or normal? Last night. High voltage. No, normal. No, high voltage. I don't know what to say. Why do you ask? You'll catch cold drinking that. Nice of you to care. Want some? I always have sex the first night. You're a strange girl. 06 42 49 48... 48...? - 30. - 30. Why won't you tell me your name? At least tell me how you know Margaux? Not that again. Why do you care? Because, because. Stay. What for? For real, what for? Everyone always says stay. But what for? You knew my number, so you called me. We met briefly on a train. You take me to dinner, I come up, drink, have sex, wake up... Another guy, apartment, naked ass, fridge... You'll get there. Where? To love. Or something like it. Do you still love Margaux? I don't know. Know. If it started snowing right now, I'd stay. A while. No sign of a flake. Let her catch the prize! It's nothing to you, everything to her! I'll come down. I never caught the prize either. Because I was slow and clumsy, not because of a sadistic jerk. I was slow and clumsy too. You're neither now. It comes. Or it goes, more like. You'll see. I smoke?! I mean, I'm going to start smoking? Yes, you smoke. Not much. Less than before. We quit for 8 years. Before? How long from now? When did we start? 15 years ago for me, so you... in 5. That I quit or I start? Start. Forget it. Too complicated. I could not start. That'd change everything. Yes, please. Try not to. It's disgusting. I liked those shoes. But they're cheap. They didn't exist. Clearly they did. Did you sleep with Marc? No. You will. I prefer to warn you. You'll be with him a while. Got someone in Paris? I've got Jean. And Jonas. Jean and Jonas? Don't know them. Or I forgot. I must've forgotten. It's freaky. Pretty freaky, yeah. It's Marc. Take it. Take it! Take it, I said. It's me, dipshit. Honey? Pee-pee! She didn't even see us. Some surprise. Come here. Here, Darling. That's right, seek solace in your dog. Still haven't unpacked? You'll win again. Not bad, huh? Mom's handiwork. Your mustache is crooked. Are you ok? You seem upset. I'm fine. Where'd you sleep? We were worried. Especially your mother. Just let us know next time. Ok, I will. Is she a musketeer too? Yes. She found a wig with real hair at Goodwill. Like to join us tonight? No, thank you! You're funny, Dad. I like you. I like you, too. Shall I clear off the ironing board for you? It's over. That's absurd. Get an appetizer or dessert. You don't have to eat it. I'm fractioning. I can't eat after 6:30 pm. I've got acid reflux. My esophagus ate part of my stomach. Sorry, but we've been through the wars. Right, the wars... Trench warfare and too many bloody battles! No? No, there were a few skirmishes we enjoyed. At least I did. - You're allowed wine? - No. You drink now? You used to hate it. You're on your third glass. I'm getting older. See? I'm a wreck. But I've still got it, right? Do I or don't I? Tell me! You totally do. Why were you in Paris? For the Bonnard expo. No, for my dad's estate. You wish it was for the art. I didn't mind you missing art expos. - Sure you did. - Not at all. No, I felt... I mean... - Let's just say... - Blah, blah, blah! You resented me for that. What're you looking at? Nothing. Looking for snow. If it snowed, I'd take you home. No sign of a flake. No sign of the moon. - When do you start teaching again? - April. Did you make the most of it? I redid my bathroom. Not by myself. - I meant your exam, are you studying? - Oh, that! I'm going backwards, if that's possible. Want to see my bathroom? You bet I do. It's important to me. I really mean the bathroom, nothing else. Same here. Shall we? Here we are. Yes, I know. Don't look at my ass. I know your ass well. That singer still here? She's sleeping now, thank god. - Does she still bring pancakes? - Yep. Very nice in here. Very nice bathroom. Did you hire Yurek? No, he wasn't free. A friend of his, Aliocha. Aliocha... Dreamy name. He wasn't bad-looking. Stop imagining things. Really nice faucet. You can't say you've had no one, though. No, I can't. How'd you know the code? I concentrated hard. No, a guy came in. Sorry, I've got no pancakes. I'm not alone. I know. I wanted to ring before... things evolved. Nothing's evolving. Just showing him my new bathroom. I'm worried about Esther. Come in. I'll be going. No! Remember Margaux, from the train station? Seriously? Margaux? You, too? Where'd you meet? In Paris. We met in Paris, right? In Paris. Former student? Teacher's pet? You're a teacher? - Don't tell me you're a teacher! - History and geography. What's so terrible about that? I was going. I have no herbal tea or anything. Hate that stuff. Me too. All I've got is Génépi. Want some? - What's Génépi? - A liqueur skiers love. Marc's a great skier. He's got his Silver Arrow. You're lucky. Why, will he take me skiing? You seem happy. Had you seen him again? He was weird when I introduced you. No, I didn't. Esther sent me this. "Gynecologist, tiny lump. Call u later." Frowny face. She's not picking up. That's nothing, they'll remove it. It's later that... Give me your phone. "I'm here for you... Margaux." Can I sit down? Her daughter was at the funeral. Minouchette. Minouchette? She named her Minouchette? Or will? No, Minouchette is... Minouchette, you know. Her cute little nickname. What's her real name? No idea. You don't know? How is that possible? You suck. Why'd you lose touch? I told you, I moved back here to Lyon when I quit my Master's in Paris. - I'd slept with my advisor... - Enough. - I'm going back to Paris. - No, stay! - How's this fucking door open? - Push, turn, pull. Please come back. C'mon, stop. Think it through, think it through... and come back up. Thanks. Wanna go for a drink? I'm off now. There's a bar nearby. A drink? Yeah, just a drink. It's nearby. Nicolas, nice to meet you. Nicolas? Nicolas... I don't know. I mean, I truly don't know yet. I'll tell you in a sec. Nicolas, right? Margaux? Yeah, quick! Nicolas, cab driver, a drink... Ring any bells? A cab driver? I don't recall. So it's up to you. What do you want to do? 'Cause you were right about Ludo. Are you sure? Did you do the test? The test? What test? You're pregnant, Margaux. Pregnant? Margaux? Margaux? Yes. Hold on... Hello? You took your Ambien, sorry. No, I quit taking it 4 years ago. I wasn't sleeping. Really? That's great news. Yeah? I don't know. Yeah, I guess. What's up? I can still call for no reason, can't I? Working tomorrow? It's a holiday. I mean, working at home? I haven't had much work since I slept with a juror. You say "slept with" now? All we did was sleep! Try to make them buy that. Let's just say my reputation is... Tarnished is the word. Want to come over? I didn't dare ask. Shall I meet you halfway? I'm not scared anymore. Excuse me! What's wrong? Have you been crying? No, it's just cold out. Liar. I know you. What's wrong? Tell me. You know what I'm thinking. Nothing would be the same if... Don't you see? Yes. I have a pretty good idea. That's the one. Come in. I'd have kept it if I'd been sure it was yours. I know. I know, Margaux. Come in, it's freezing. Shit, girl! What time is it? It's only 10:34 p.m. You never call me back. I konked out on my computer. Tired? No more than usual. I went out last night. Got in at 6. So you're ok? I forgot to tell you. The biopsy's ok. - Did you get an MRI? - No need. What's with you? It's benign. Keep a close eye on it. Request an MRI. Come off it. You sound like my mother. I am your mother! Dummy! When are you coming back? I'm staying here a while. I may study history and geography, get a studio. History and geography? We hated that. Don't be silly, come home. You don't know names and locations of countries. Like... Where's Mozambique? East Africa. Below Tanzania, above Swaziland. Shit. That's right. I met a guy. An African? No, a guy from Lyon. A lawyer. Could've been. Sure, it could've been. I've been seeing the woman from the party, too. What woman? What party? The woman... The woman who's me. Ludo's party. The woman who's you? What do you mean? What woman? I'm lost. The woman in the bathroom with me. About 45. There was no woman, girl. - You were drunk. - You forgot. I remember very well. We left with Ludo. - His scooter was stolen. - Forget it! Don't yell at me. What's with you? I'm signing off, got work tomorrow. Wait! Sorry. Wait. What? Nothing. I love you. Bye. Are you there? Are you there? I had a meeting Take your time Shut the door behind you Look at yourself See how beautiful you are You're early. You too. Girls always make you wait. Not me. That's a cliché. Are you old or what? Want some? There's milk in it! Yeah. We couldn't meet at yours or a café? We had to meet... at the zebras? You were with Margaux, is that it? Afraid she'd see us? You're neighbors. Did you tell her about us? No. I don't know... They're either too white, too black, or too striped. Where'd you meet Margaux? Here. Here in Lyon? Here at the zebras. She was looking for them, they were gone. They're here now, right? Yes. And? Nothing. Where were they? I don't know. Sick, or put away somewhere. That's what I told her when she asked me, like you just did. Margaux! Come back. What's wrong? I want to kiss you. It'll pass. Not anytime soon. We're slobbery. It's freezing. Can't give you my hat, my niece gave me lice. Ah, ok. Sorry, I don't have much time. More than usual. You've been avoiding me for a year. I'm here now. Why'd you want to see me? You were drunk, I was drunk. I don't do that anymore and I wouldn't do it again. You have a wife, a good life, a niece with lice, everything's great for you. We're separated. I love you. Go get her back. You don't love me, I guarantee it. The one thing I'm sure of in my life is that you don't love me! And knowing that makes me feel strong. It galvanizes me, makes me... makes me... Ok, I get it. Don't knock yourself out. What about that? Does seeing your ex with someone else galvanize you? She's pretty cute, too. Margaux's over there. Don't turn around. Don't hand me the groceries, don't kiss me. Does it affect you? What do you feel? Feeling anything here? Whatever you do, stay away from her. She's off limits. I don't take orders. Bye. She wouldn't want you anyway! "Lyon is tiny to those who love each other as we do." We who, we two? He's not my favorite poet. - I hope not. - I liked him when I was little. Yes, me too. We two, we three, you two... You two, too. We three? What are you driving at? That hadn't occurred to me. I'm not into that, and neither is he. Neither am I. Give me a hand. I hear you've got skis. I see. I didn't know how to tell you. What, that you've already slept together? He'd never invite you skiing if you hadn't made love. I've never made love, with him or anyone else. I can't even say the words. I have sex, that's it. When was it, exactly? What does it matter? Did you do the test? As positive as they get. But it doesn't reveal the father. I'll tell you who it is. Who is it? I have to think about it. It's not like I'm keeping it. You don't know. Get real, you don't know what you'll do. You're here? It looked good on you. You'll catch your death! Want it? I didn't spit in it. Would you drink my spit? Yeah, I could. Really? That's not nothing. I'd drink your spit, too. Would you drink Margaux's spit? I don't know, it's different. You look glum. Are you? Sorry you came? Yes. Don't be. I wouldn't have come without you. Why not? She's too young, too recklessly pregnant. She's a shrimp with a peanut in her belly. Not even a peanut yet. But she's still a shrimp. She loves you. No, I don't believe so. She leaves in the morning. That's your criteria? You men have no clue. I didn't stay either. Yes, you did. - No. - Yes! Believe me, you did. Really? Ok. Take my word for it. Think we can smoke? I don't know. Will you give me one? Easy, don't move too much. We're swaying. Don't worry, it's on tight. It's creaking. Stupid ski suit! What can I say? I can't stand this. How does it stay up? When was it made? How often is it checked? Strange, I wasn't afraid. Relax. Relax? See? Sore muscles, my ass. He didn't want to ski with us. I slow you down. I slow you two down. Nonsense. You don't slow us down at all. You'll be with him 9 years. 9 years! Come on. Flexibility... and imagination. Flexibility and imagination? Understood? Come on! Shit! Are you ok? Madam? You ok? I'm totally fine. Can you feel your toes? Can you move them? Don't worry, she's fine! Don't worry. Esther? Where's Esther? - Are you Esther? - No, no. - She's bleeding. - She'll be fine. She's more frightened than hurt. She's not ok, we called for help. She's just shaken up. A nice hot chocolate and she'll be fine. It worked for me when... Madam? House... red... House, red... Yes. House, red... and...? House, red, and... Vroom vroom. House, red, vroom vroom. Car! It's car. Repeat. - Car. - No, everything. Repeat everything. House, red... I forget. House, red, car! How hard is that? Mine was ball, lemon, rabbit. I still remember. Shouldn't you ask her who the president is? Sorry, I'll let you do your job. So... This happens a lot, it's normal. It's probably mild head trauma. The confusion will gradually subside. Don't I need an x-ray? No, the clinical exam is normal, perfectly reassuring. Keep an eye on her. Any headaches or vomiting... Wake her up every 2 hours, like we said. Who's this lady? She's the doctor, Margaux. You took a bad fall, but you're ok. Like I said, you're fine. No, I mean you? It's me! Margaux. Me! She doesn't recognize me. Will that subside too? No, I'm Margaux! It'll come back to her. You have to admit, it is quite confusing! Where've you been? I went snowshoeing, no coverage. Are you ok? - I told you to rent helmets. - Yes you did, but we didn't. She doesn't recognize me. She's out of it. This is Marc. Do you recognize Marc? No need to articulate like that. Yes, vaguely. I must've slept with him or something like that. Something like that, yeah. Still don't recognize me? No, sorry. But you seem nice. Nice, ok. Nice. I don't know what to do now. Pizza? Pizza? Ok, pizza. Coming? Shouldn't I see a doctor? No. Let's go, come. Careful. Thank you. - Enjoy. - Thanks. What do you do for a living? I teach history and geography. What I hated most in high school. Careful, it's hot. I'm not hungry and I hate mushrooms. You hate mushrooms? I love them. Really? Yeah, why? You don't like mushrooms, I guarantee it. But I do. I love mushrooms. Even the word makes you sick. Mushroom. They're spongey, absorb oil... You hate them. I know what I like. Can I borrow your ketchup? Of course! He's cute! You'll start sleeping with just anyone again. Excuse me? You forgot, but we knew each other like no two other people do. We were each other's chance of a lifetime to start over. Start what over? I don't understand. It's snowing! Don't go to the toilet, no paper. She's your wife? Sorry, I shouldn't have said... - I shouldn't have said... - Everything's fine. She's my wife, indeed. As you say. Remember this? I thought you'd like it. How do you feel? I'm ok. It's the prize! What's it doing here? It's filthy. - Close your eyes, touch your nose. - You've made me do it all night. Go on, do it again. I'm sore all over but otherwise ok. I could've broken my neck. I could've died. You'd have sent my body home. I knew you were fine. How did you know? You still don't know who I am? Sure, you told me. We met at Ludo's party, we met again in Lyon, I slept with Marc... Sorry, I didn't know he was your husband. We're not married. He said you were his wife. He said that? He used the word wife? Are you sure? Yeah. I'm pregnant. I know Margaux, I know. I won't ask what you're planning to do. No. It's my business. Your business, yes. Packed your suitcase? Leaving? I won't be a third wheel. My train's at 10:11. You really don't remember? Tell me, and I'll tell you if I remember. You'll miss your train. And as they say, "Mustn't miss your train." Who's they? Who says that? Me. I just made it up. But it's true, isn't it? Mustn't miss your train. It's cleared up. Seems so. What? We can do a weather report. Absolutely. - I'm cold. - Me too. Let's move. Got you a hot dog. That's all they had. A hot dog? I've never eaten one. Me neither. Here you go. Let's not end this on a hot dog. Here it comes. Margaux! - I have something to tell you. - Yes? House, red, car. House, red, car? I don't understand. I'll tell you. I'll tell you the whole story. This is where it's happening. I know. Now I know.
