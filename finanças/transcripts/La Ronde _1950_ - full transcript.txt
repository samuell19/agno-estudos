And I, what have I to do with this story, La Ronde? Am I the author? The compére? A passer-by? I am you, any one of you The incarnation of your desire... your desire to know everything People never grasp reality in its entirety Why? Because they see only one aspect of things I see them all, because I see... in the round This enables me to be everywhere at once. Everywhere But where are we now? On a stage? In a studio? Who can tell? In a street We're in Vienna... 1900 A change of clothes 1900... we are in the past I adore the past It's so much more restful than the present... ...so much more reliable than the future There's the sun It's springtime You can tell that the scent of love is in the air, can't you? What else before love can begin its round? A waltz Here is the waltz The waltz whirls, the carousel whirls... ...and the rounds of love can begin The world's a stage that spins and spins Clouds fall to earth as rain Rainwater turns to clouds again Respectable woman or susceptible jade Gentleman of leisure or soldier by trade All are led the same merry dance When love chooses its victims of chance Now the carousel is under way As twilight marks the end of day See here come the lady of sin And the rondo of love can begin - Coming with me, handsome? - You misunderstand, Madame - Madame? Are you having me on? - I never have anyone on - Are you coming or not, then? - I'm not playing the game - The game? - I spin the wheel You understand? It starts with you So position yourself at the corner of the street, if you will You hear that? Yes, it's the army... soldiers again There always are soldiers But your one is the sixth - He'll be like all the rest - Yes, but he'll go with you The Tart and the Soldier Coming with me, handsome? Don't you want to? "Handsome"? Me? Who do you think I mean? I live close by; come and warm up a bit I must return to barracks You've time and it's nicer at my place - I bet it is - Not so loud, there are cops about Are you joking? I've a short way with cops - A scrapper, are you? - A bit - Leave me alone, I've no money - I don't want money Are you Rothschild's daughter? No, but civilians pay; for boys like you it's free Free? You must be the one Michel met... at the Schiffsgasse café I've met more than one of you boys there All right, but hurry You can't wait now it's free. You could at least give me a kiss - Been in the army long? - Do you want my life story? - Where do you live? - Ten minutes walk away You said it was close It is if you like me I like you, but it's too far Come and see me tomorrow, then Give me your address - No, you won't come - I tell you I will If my place is too far, come over here No one will bother us - I don't like it here - I like it anywhere This is losing time Watch your feet; this is suicide corner You're a funny little thing - There's a bench over there - We're not standing on ceremony I'd have liked a boy like you No, I'm the jealous type Sorry, this is my first disguise Don't start that row again! Seen Franz? He's got my spurs Franz is otherwise engaged Yes, and taking rather too long about it Not so fast I'll be on a charge - At least tell me your name - What's the difference? - I'm Léocadie - That's a weird one Not even a farewell cigarette? I've run out. Good night! Some night I'd have if they were all as hard-up as you Go on, miser! Look how the bastard runs! Look at him running away! The bastard! Not even a cigarette! That's men for you! Just in time to keep the carousel going Hurry, or you'll catch it What's it to you? You mustn't be confined to barracks on Saturday Hurry! Back to barracks the soldier goes But the time till Saturday quickly flows And at the dance-hall once again free He meets Mademoiselle Marie I didn't want to at first, remember? It's not my fault you're so sweet You're the nicest little armful of all tonight, Mademoiselle Marie Sampled them all, did you? You can tell, just by dancing You danced more with that frightful blonde than with me Five times. I was beginning to wonder... ...how you could like dancing with that awful face Her brother's a friend of mine - The one with the waxed moustache? - No, with the gravelly voice That proves nothing It means she's out of bounds. Let's sit down No, Monsieur Franz, it's too dark here - Fear not, I am with you - That's just it You must learn to trust me We haven't known each other long enough We know each other as well as some married couples There's a seat Taken! Don't be afraid There's another bench; let's sit for a while All right, if you'll be good, Franz. Promise? Listen, pal... Sorry, sir I think I left my sword on the seat Remember: A soldier should never be parted from his sword It was only a minute... Even so, a sword is a sword Don't let it happen again - You're so masterful - That's how one commands men As for pretty women... - What's wrong? - I'm buckling my sword Franz, you're a bad boy - Do you love me? - Of course - What's the rush? - To get back - Where? - The dance There's no point in hanging about the park any more Do you really love me, Franz? Listen to the music - You want to dance - Why not? I can't, I must get back. I'll catch it, as it is My mistress doesn't like me going out If you must, you must I thought you'd see me home You want me to go with you? It's so dreary going all alone Where's the house where you work? In the Porzellangasse That's on my way But I don't want to go just yet; I've a pass until midnight I see. It's that frightful blonde's turn now I don't think she's so frightful Men are horrible Please, Franz, no more dancing tonight Stay with me a little longer Sit and wait for me if you like. Are you thirsty? A beer for the young lady, please I don't want to dance any more tonight I don't know you. Who are you? Nobody. Or, rather, anybody - What do you want? - To ask you to take a little walk I must get back I'm afraid you are going to be sacked for sneaking out I'll have to find another job, won't I? You'll find one, believe me No better and no worse than any other But two months from now, fate will be very kind to you Where are we? Where are you taking me? We are taking a little stroll through time Two months. That's a long time You are there already. Just look This is the house Go upstairs... go on It's your new job Are you sure? Really? I'm sure. Go on, pluck up your courage You're not going to leave me alone? I must; but don't worry, your soldier will be much nicer to you Let's hope it's not too late Waltz and turn It is his turn now to adore But your heart is a bit flighty And worships another more The Maid and the Young Man Dear Mademoiselle Marie I got your new address I'm glad your new employers are nice But how old is the son? I saw you yesterday when we were on parade You didn't acknowledge my sign Was that on purpose or didn't you see me? Dear Monsieur Franz Monsieur and Madame are away so I've plenty of time to write I was so glad to get your letter But how old is the son? You rang, Monsieur Alfred? Yes, Marie, I rang. What was it I wanted? Oh yes, would you close the shutters, please? It won't be so hot You're very brave, Monsieur Alfred... ...working in this weather Bring me a glass of water Let it run until it's nice and cold Don't spill it - I wonder what time it is? - Nearly five, Monsieur Alfred Marie... didn't I hear the doorbell? No, are you expecting someone? Yes. You know Professor Schuller? The man with the beard who came two days ago? Yes, he comes twice a week, at five He's coaching me in French. What time is it? A quarter to five Well, he's always a bit late - I thought... - What did you think, sir? It's just that your bodice... Don't you like my bodice, sir? It's blue, isn't it? You dress very nicely - Aren't you too hot? - It's broad daylight, sir You're quite right, Marie Don't mind me You're so lovely, you don't have to mind anyone Oh Marie, your hair smells so nice I saw you one evening, you know, when I came home very late I went to the kitchen for some water The door of your room was open, so... I saw things Your skin is so white Suppose someone rings? We won't answer Which floor, sir? The third The lady and gentleman are away I know; it's their son I'm to see He isn't in But he told me he wasn't going with his parents He must have changed his mind No, he's expecting me Really? Who are you, anyway? You wouldn't know me; I'm new No one's there, I assure you I imagine you'll find that the shutters are closed Well, thank you for saving me the climb Don't thank me; just keeping it going Keeping what going? The carousel, Professor The carousel? I'm sure someone rang Go and see Nobody's there He can't have come How very fortunate I'm going for a walk; I need to take the air I feel ten years older Enjoy your walk, Monsieur Alfred You're not angry with me? I'm sure I'll be seeing you again - Naturally. Why do you say that? - No reason I'll see you later Yes, Monsieur Alfred Soon after that gala day Seized by love's dizzy sway The young man's eager head Was turned by one already wed Whirl and whirl, my manikins Oft of love the young man sings But virtue stills his fevered pleas When he craves boons she flees If flowers have their subtle charms Here are roses in his arms Yet not quite enough to sway Her modesty from virtue's way A sip of wine that intoxicates Would soon lure to heaven's gates But a lady of such airy graces Does not drink in public places So pay the rent On discreet rooms The key is lent And new hope looms One fine day at the appointed hour Burning with ardour he enters the bower He waits as blithe as a bird Today she has given her word Wait for me Five minutes The Young Man and the Married Woman Shut the door quickly Were you followed? I hope not, I changed cabs three times. What madness What time is it? A quarter to six. You're not late What a nice place you have So cosy - Is it really your place? - Well, yes... at present - Since when? - For some time Won't you sit down? Yes, I'm so nervous I can hardly stand You'll feel better with your cape off And your veil Two You'll feel better with your hat off You're more lovely than ever How sweet. Do you love me? How can you doubt it? Then prove it by letting me go I am here as you wished. You promised to behave - And now good-bye - Don't torture me, Emma - The five minutes are over - Barely five seconds What time is it? Five to six. I should be at my sisters Let her wait; you see her every day Oh Alfred, why did I listen to you? I've thought about you so often, Emma, and I know you're unhappy Life is so dreary So empty and so brief, so terribly brief Unless love happens to cross one's path Who could have foreseen this a week ago, even yesterday? Yet two days ago you promised You hadn't yet turned my head then Yesterday I wrote you a letter, breaking it off I never received it I tore it up. I should have sent it Good-bye, Alfred; we must not meet again What is behind that door? It's... a room What sort of room? Another drawing-room Two drawing-rooms? Yes, it's a large apartment I am going to ask you a question, Alfred Promise to answer truthfully? Have other women been here? Well, the building is over fifty years old... You know quite well what I mean Never, Emma, never. As I explained to you... So it was especially for me that you... - Was that wrong? - Not at all What are you making me do? What time is it? It must be late I'd like something to drink... a glass of water Wouldn't you rather have something... Anything I'm afraid I broke the cork The other room, I meant to tell you... You gave me such a fright Don't worry about it, darling But I was certain... I've been like a mad man all day Have you read Stendhal? Yes, Stendhal's book, On Love It reveals something very characteristic Some cavalry officers describe their amatory adventures Do you follow me? Yes, what about their adventures? Well, they all say... ...that it's with the women they most desired... ...that it happened... you know, what happened to me It's very characteristic, isn't it? Furthermore, only one of them claims... ...that it didn't happen to him Maybe it was true Ah, but Stendhal says he's a braggart I don't see why there shouldn't be one Wait, you haven't heard the best of it Just imagine, one of these cavalry officers says... ...he spent three nights with the woman he truly desired... ...or maybe it was six, I don't recall... Three, I expect But you don't know what comes next No, but I expect it was three Anyway, this officer and the woman he loved were together... ...for three nights... ...and all they did was weep They wept? Both of them? They wept for joy... ...happy just to be together Don't you find that understandable? I think it's natural in lovers Surely there are some who don't weep? Yes, of course Oh good, because I thought Stendhal meant... ...that all cavalry officers wept You're making fun of me Not at all. Don't be cross You saying that makes me cross - You'll make yourself ill - Pile it on! No, really, I think it's sweet just to remain good friends - That's the last straw! - What can I say, then? Let's maintain a symbolic silence What time is it, Alfred darling? The time's long past Where's your watch? In my waistcoat Where's your waistcoat? No, Alfred... I must go It must be terribly late It was so nice just being friends There, that's better now Eight o'clock! Luckily the cab has waited for me - Because you told him to - Five minutes, I told him He knows this life I know this place See you tomorrow at the Lobheimers? We'll dance the first waltz I wouldn't dare - Here, then, the day after - You're mad, darling You want to come back? Let's discuss it tomorrow, dancing the first waltz I'm a married woman's lover! The Married Woman and her Husband - What are you doing? - I'm reading Stendhal - Is it a good book? - Very instructive Nine hundred payable on the fifteenth... A credit of 4,100 due for September... - What's the matter? - I should ask you that Me? Why? You look so lovely, quite transformed Was I plain before? You were young; you've blossomed You're very gallant tonight Business is booming Ah yes, of course Husbands have their worries, you know Are you working or talking? I'm working, naturally I'm going to sleep Emma... do you remember Venice? Yes, our honeymoon It was nice Turn up the light I wanted to explain something to you You see, husbands... No, that's not it Husbands cannot always be lovers There is a time for everything Periods of calm in which one remains friends And other times not quite so... calm We have known spells of both kinds; that's how it should be I didn't say no, I said oh Mind you... No, I've said that before It's as it should be, because without periods of calm... ...there wouldn't be any... not quite so calm ones You understand? It's perfectly clear Seasonal change is the very basis of life Conjugal love, you see is... how shall I put it? Marriage... marriage is a perplexing mystery Young ladies of good family... ...you come to us pure and innocent We have our experience, but bought at what cost The creatures to whom we are forced to turn in our youth We have no choice Tell me about these creatures; they interest me very much Are you joking? No, I've often asked to hear about your youth... with these creatures No, Emma, you don't understand; it would be a sort of desecration But it was so long ago Did you have a married woman? What do you mean? I think the question is clear Yes, but what makes you ask such a question? Do you know one of these... - Married women? - Faithless wives How should I know? - One of your friends? - I don't know, Charles Has one confided in you? No, no one Do you suspect one of them? I can't think of anyone Is that true? Promise me this, Emma Never associate with a woman you suspect may not be irreproachable I know you would avoid such company, but a woman of doubtful reputation... ...tends to cultivate respectability in the acquaintances she chooses Suffering a sense of deep humiliation, she yearns... ...for her lost virtue Do you think so? I know so. Think of her perilous life of lies and deception She pays dear for her moment of... not even happiness... Of pleasure? How can you call it pleasure? Well, I assume so, otherwise... But it's an aberration; yes, a moment of aberration Of which you took advantage? Yes, once Who was it? Long ago? Very long ago She is dead Dead? These women always die young - Are you sure they die young? - It's a fact. It's justice Did you love her? One does not love such women One can truly love... ...only in truth and purity That's true What time is it? Who cares, with our lives before us? How reassuring Remember Venice Give me your hand The Husband and... ...the Little... How shall I put it? The Little Milliner? No, she's not a working girl The Little Cocotte? No, she's no cocotte; she's a sweet little thing You simply don't understand I'm only a beginner, sir Experience of life is all it takes Certainly, Monsieur Breitkopf How do you know my name? I had the honour to serve you when I was with Wachtl at Mayerling Mayerling... then you know my culinary preferences? Certainly, Monsieur Breitkopf. And to drink? Champagne, naturally Prawns... venison... pineapple... Why not? She is young Are you thirsty? What must you think of me? Because this is a private room... ...and because I accepted at once What could happen in a restaurant? The waiter could come in any time I adore prawns It prickles - Nice here, isn't it? - It's classy Tell me, have you ever been in a private dining-room before? Do you really want to know? Well, yes, I have But not like you think; with a friend and her intended I'd have seen no harm even if you had said... ...your boyfriend I haven't any boy-friend. I swear it Do you expect me to believe... There hasn't been anyone for six months Who was he? He looked like you Otherwise... You mean that otherwise you wouldn't have let me speak to you? He had such charm You talk just like him and you have the same eyes What did he do for a living? For a living? Oh, those eyes of yours! You, too, remind me of someone My youth My glass is empty Wait, there must be a little left How old are you? More important, how old are you? Eighteen? No, nineteen - And you? Thirty? - Just about, yes There must be something in the champagne My head is spinning What if I can't get up again? I adore you The bill, sir Tell me... you saw the girl? I noticed the young lady when you arrived, sir - Do you know her? - No, I've never seen her before I've been wondering... After all, I know nothing of her. A foolish infatuation There should be no call for regrets - You think so? - In my experience, sir Oh dear, that champagne What must you think of me? Simply that you like me But really, that champagne... When two young people feel attracted, spiked champagne is not needed... I was just using the champagne as an excuse, like people do I'm a bit ashamed But I resemble your first love, don't I? Was he a lieutenant? No, he left the army. His father has a café Do you realize it's half-past eleven? Think of your mother - You've had enough of me? - No, but you said... I don't even know your name You're not the same any more, Charles My umbrella - Will I see you soon? - I only come to Vienna occasionally I bet you're married They usually are when they "come to Vienna occasionally" Don't you regret seducing a married man? No, his wife's probably doing the same I forbid you to say that! So you do have a wife Whether I have or not, your joke is in very bad taste Seriously, though, I'd like to see you often I must be sure of you, but I can't keep an eye on you all the time Men like you don't turn up every day True, but you're... you're not naive so much as young Unscrupulous tempters lie in wait for girls like you So, although I do not live in Vienna... ...we could come to an arrangement, provided... ...your love is for me alone We could find a little nest for you... ...where I would join you on each of my visits I could afford a place... rented, of course I would suggest a quiet district but a nice one A lovely house with a fine hallway waxed floors beautifully polished brasses and an imposing staircase See the welcome mat is set It is for our young grisette She has found a poet's charms More alluring than the husband's arms Are all poets like you? The truly great, but we are few I'm a bit scared You find me impressive? Won't you light the other candles? We are bathed in an ocean of light all day long... ...from which we emerge to throw the cloak of night about us Cloak is too prosaic, don't you think? Me? I don't know What sublime incomprehension! Let's see... cloak, wrapper of night... Starry shawl, that's it Let's see... cloak, wrapper of night... Starry shawl, that's it - Why starry? - Be quiet! Don't say a word Can you write in the dark? By the light of my inspiration, yes Let's see: Ocean... light... You're writing it down? Inspiration, alas, has but a short memory It dogs us, this forced marriage of poetic throe and prosaic chore Yes, perfect: Poetic throe and prosaic chore. Are you thirsty? - No, hungry - I wish you were thirsty Why? I tell you I'm hungry Drinks I have. Shall I go for sausages? No, not sausages Dinner in a private room? Again? It must be a craze with men You've dined in a private room? With a seducer? No, with a friend and her intended, see? No, I don't see. I can't even see if you're blushing I suspect you're lying, but I can't see you at all You should have set me down in writing How incredibly profound; you have defined the entire tragedy of desire - Can't you talk like other people? - I've never tried First tell me if you love me Yes, I love you - Why? - Because you're not like the rest It shows? It's audible. For you, love seems to be something... Immaterial. Take off your dress. Take it off, I said Night is here with her veil, sprinkling the galaxy at our feet So take off your dress, take everything off But I'm cold Night restores to us fifty suns hidden by the day Imagine we are in a mysterious Indian palace The Indian nights are warm; take off your chemise A heavy, sultry humidity envelops us Do you love me? The bill - What time is it? - A little after eleven - I make it five to twelve - So do I - Something must have kept her - Yes, sir. Nothing serious - You think so? - I'm sure of it Not thirsty, sir? Zealous blast on zephyr breeze alike will please the pallid trees when blanched their branches dance 'neath winter's snowy circumstance Now I shall offer you a dazzling gift I shall reveal my name: Kuhlenkampf Astounded, are you not? Why? It's quite an ordinary name Don't you know the name? Is it true you write plays? Plays they perform in theatres? My child, you are beauty, simplicity, life - What if I were a butcher's boy? - I'd love you just the same Swear you did not know I was Kuhlenkampf I told you I didn't You melt me to tears. Forget what I told you I am not Kuhlenkampf; I am simply Robert I'm not a writer, but a clerk, pianist in a café by night Our love shall endure eternally in simple grandeur What café do you play in? No more questions. Come away with me, for three months or three weeks What about your boss? And my mother? Let them console each other We shall live in the forest, naked, eating fruit, drinking from streams Then we shall say farewell Why farewell? I thought... True love must have its farewell You shall see Kuhlenkampf's play He's my friend. Afterwards I shall hear your opinion of this great work The Poet and the Actress Why did you cut the last line again? "Our love shall endure eternally in simple grandeur" No one says such things Why did you send Carlotta away? So that I could kiss you. Tonight is ours, isn't it? Do you really want to go? It's two hours drive by sleigh It was you who made me reserve the rooms I don't know why two rooms One never knows the turn of events To my place, then It will be cold with no fire Your place? Are you joking? What about my mother? To the sleighs, then - Can you tell me the time, please? - A little after eleven - I make it five to twelve - So do I Why do you play with me? You are talent, beauty, life... - Because I'm an actress - Can't you forget the theatre? Why forget it? What would either of us be without the theatre? A man and a woman And you think a man and a woman would go away as we plan to... ...if they weren't of the theatre In other words, you don't love me any more And you? You're right. Ah, redoubtable theatre! We know all our lines You chose that inn for its memories, didn't you? You'll spend the evening comparing memories of a past love... ...banishing me to my room twenty times But you will not be banished the twenty-first time, you know that You know, and I love you for it - Do you love those who don't know? - All of them a my manikins The world's a stage that spins and spins Clouds fall to earth as rain Rain water turns to clouds again The Actress and the Count Is that you, Count? Just one moment I come at your mother's suggestion, or I would not have dared... Do sit down May I offer my respects? Yesterday I saw you on stage for the first time Only yesterday? Yes, we are still dining when performances start, so... May I return to bed? Please be seated You were saying? That I dine late Then you must dine later Or not at all; there is no pleasure in dining And what does offer pleasure at your age? Count Bobby and I often discuss that Love? Love is an illusion And happiness? More talked of than fact, I fear; there is no such thing How very true Unlike sensual pleasure Which, like intoxication, is a fact; I know I have experienced it And when it's over, it's over Between unknown future and mournful past, we cling to the present One loses direction... do you follow me? Sit closer by me Where may I put my helmet? I knew you would come today I knew it at the theatre yesterday Didn't you realize I was acting for you alone? You saw me there? Unfasten your sword No, give it to me Ask me something Have I your permission to return tonight? Why put off till tonight... Well, love-making in the morning... no, I see matters differently How do you see matters? I shall wait in my carriage by the stage-door. We shall dine, return... Then things will take their natural course You're so sweet. Don't you find it warm here? Undo this, quickly It's dark enough to imagine that it's night And no one can see us, except ourselves Censorship May I return to bed? The day after tomorrow, shall we say? Why then? You said tonight What I said would be meaningless now... morally speaking, I mean Morally speaking, I must see you tonight I have something to say about our souls Then I shall wait at the stage-door No, you will wait here. In my bedroom No supper at the Imperial? No, there would be no philosophical significance in that Very well I must take my leave. I trust I have not outstayed my welcome Delighted to have made your acquaintance, Count Please tender my respects to your mother - Haven't I seen you before? - Perhaps; I get about Have you served here long? I do not serve. Love of art brings me here - And what art is that? - Love Love of the art of love Most amusing. Good-bye Towards what love are you headed now, Count? Where was I headed last night? Certainly not to her place I was alone no I was with Count Bobby I was in a pitiful state I didn't go to the stage-door I supped alone with Harras A lively occasion I believe A joyous company at my heels Katie Doudeu and Harras of course And that woman? No I didn't follow that woman I wanted to be alone certainly didn't follow no When it's over, it's over No idea where I am Good morning, handsome. Slept well? Young or old, does it matter to you? I'm sleepy I know... who you remind me of I remind you of someone The same eyes It's hallucinating Let me kiss your eyes before I go Tell me, doesn't it upset you? The fact that we didn't... Oh, there are lots of men like that It's the wrong time of day, that's all. Anyway, I know you're attracted Good-bye, soldier How do you know I'm attracted? Well, last night Didn't I collapse on the sofa last night? Yes, you did With me Don't you remember? You'd had quite a skinful Am I more like her than before? Less... less than before One loses direction... do you follow me? Don't you salute officers any more? I had to have those salute each other The circuit is closed So the carousel ends In less than two hours And I tell you my friends Its story is ours
