Who are you? What is this place? We found you in terrible conditions. What happened? I don't know. Maybe you got into an accident. Accident? Don't you remember anything? I have to go home. Where is your home? What is your name? You really can't remember anything? Not even your name? Don't push her. Let her get some rest first. Don't be scared, You're safe here. How is she? She can't remember anything about herself. What then? You're awake. What's wrong? It's nothing. Then, let's join us for dinner. What should I call you? I'm Dewi. This is Desta. Join us for dinner. No. I'm staying here. What if they come and no one knows? Let's go. I'm Diana. Fajar. That one's Hanung. And I'm Shinta. Please sit down. Sorry for that. I didn't... No, it's okay. Let's forget about it. So, you don't remember anything? At all? That's weird. Fortunately, we found you before it was too late. Yeah. You wouldn't be here right now if we hadn't. How bad was it? You were... Your head was bleeding. We thought you were dead. What happened? Was it a car accident? We don't know. We are actually curious. Perhaps, you are the only one who knows. Don't you think it's weird? How come there's no clue at all? No wallet or handphone... We were only trying to help you. We understand. You must be confused and have a lot of questions. But the important thing now is you're safe. For now... ...we will try our best to help you... ...until you're fully recovered. Thank you. But I hope this is only temporary. You don't have to worry. We are more than happy to have you here. Are we here to talk or eat? Let's eat! Yes? Run! What is this place actually? This is our house. But, it doesn't look like most houses. Yeah. This is a house for those who have nobody... ...and have no place in this world. I don't understand. Yeah, it may sound weird. Look at him. Hanung is different. And because he is different... ...he was seen as a burden and an embarrassment. His parents even thought about... ...what sins they might have done... ...that they got a son like him. What's wrong with him? Nothing. On the contrary, he is amazing. You will understand later. We have former drug addict, ex prostitute... ...and even criminal. You met all of them last night, didn't you? They would be happy to share their past with you... ...and how we changed their life. So, is this some kind of a rehab? Well, you can call it anything you like. But for us, this is our home. We see each other simply as humans. Nothing more, nothing less. Do you still feel strange about everything? No, but... It's just that... it sounds too good to be true. I hope that you can think of us as your family... ...and this place your home. Except this room. Never go inside this room. What happened to him? Why don't you ask him yourself? He would be happy to have someone to talk to. Excuse me. Desta, what are you doing here? I'm waiting. What are you waiting for? My family. They are going to take me from here. When are they coming? I don't know. Maybe soon. Why don't you just go home by yourself? But, what if they come and I'm not here? No. I don't want to disappoint them anymore. Disappoint them? Why are you in this place? I'm different. Men are supposed to like women... ...but I don't. And when my parents knew... ...they were ashamed and... ...they didn't want to see me anymore. I felt like the most disgusting person in the world. Why was I born like this? Do you know what I fear the most? Because I haven't seen my parents for so long, I'm scared that they would forget about me. No, Desta. They will come here to pick you up. I still remember. When I was still a kid... ...my mom used to wear a blue necklace. I thought it was hideous... ...but as long as she was happy, I was happy, too. I can still remember exactly the shape of the necklace, but... ...now I can't even remember my own mother's face clearly. They will come, Desta. How long should I wait? Where are you going? No. What's there? Nothing. You should go back to your room. Desta... We beg you, forgive us. We are sorry. Please, forgive us. Sorry. -We beg you, forgive us. -We are sorry. We are sorry. Forgive us. What is it? Nothing. Are you still thinking about what happened last night? Are you not? Excuse me? I considered Desta my own family. What are you going to do with his body? We are going to bury him here. Here? Yes. Here. His home. -With his family. -But you need to tell his real family. What for? They've got what they want. To get rid of Desta... ...from their life forever. You don't know that. He had been waiting for them. Well then, where are they now? Desta will stay with us... ...here. But you are not his real family! Wait! What do you want? I think it's time for me to get out of here. -Where do you want to go? -I don't know... -but I should go to a hospital. -Hospital? Whatever that can help me get better and remember. If hospitals could help... ...Shinta wouldn't be here right now. And have you forgotten? Out there, everything has a price. The poor cannot get sick. But still, I have to go. My family is probably out there looking for me. You should really think this through. Tomorrow, if you still want to go... ...we'll send you ourselves... ...wherever you want. Thank you. Hanung. Do you... ...want to... ...know... ...a secret? What happened? Nothing happened. Who's there? Who's there? Hanung? Run! Where do you think you're going? Let me go! What the hell is this, Dewi? What are you doing? Let me go. What did I tell you? Stay here. Let us take care of you. You haven't fully recovered yet. You are all insane. What is this place? Tell me who you really are. Why? Why do keep asking the same damn thing? Haven't I already told you? This is... This is our home... ...and we are the people who helped you. We want you... ...to see us as your own family. No! Stop pretending. I know the truth. It's not that Desta's parents never came to get him... ...but you killed them! You know nothing. Desta was better off... ...and happier without them. He killed himself! It was your fault! Maybe it was for the best. What do you want from me? Tonight, you will find out. Dewi! Dewi! Lia. Why are you still here? Lia? Who is Lia? You are Lia! You... you... Who are you? Don't you remember anything? Lia... It's me. Your brother, Sony. My brother? Reza and I did everything to get you out so you could escape. Reza? Reza was your boyfriend. I don't know. I remember nothing. What happened actually? After you tried to kill yourself... ...you came to join this community. They said that they could help you... ...cure you, so the same thing won't happen again. But after that... ...you disappeared and we didn't hear from you for a long time. Reza and I started to get worried. So we decided to join as well, to find out what was going on... ...and to bring you home. But you refused to go home. You became so fanatic with the community's teaching. Lia, let's go home. No. This is our home now. Lia. No. We started to realize. This community is a satanic sect. It was really weird... ...and nobody gets out once they join this sect. At last, you realized... ...this sect kills its members as a sacrifice for "Mother". Yes. Mother. They worship her. At last, we decided to run away. They killed Reza. I was ready to die facing them... ...so you could survive. -No. -Go! Turns out, this sect is... way more dangerous than we thought. What should we do now? It's no use... Mother will haunt you wherever you go. There must be something we could do. Unless... -You kill Mother. -Why me? Because when the ritual starts... ...you are the only one who could get close to her. No. Impossible. Mother... Or you. That's the only choice. I'm not a murderer. Mother is not a human. In a moment... Mother will be with us. This is our only chance. What do you mean? No. You don't have a choice. You are the only one who can. But why? Trust me. We don't have much time. Don't you want to get out of this place? You open the gates... ...and wait for us there. If you fail...? Why do you still have doubt... ...after everything that Mother has done? What do you mean? Stop pretending. Do you think Mother doesn't know what's inside your heart? Dewi, the people we killed were innocent. Innocent? They were nobody before Mother saved them. Saved them? -Mother is using us! -Oh, really? Is there any of you... ...who feels like being used, too? -All of us would die for Mother. -Dewi... ...when will you realize? Mother will always need a new body. Look at this! This is a satanic sect! Is this what you really want? The only difference between a sect and religion... ...is only in the number of its followers. Without worshipping Mother. Without her, we are nothing. Without her, you are no one. We forgive you. How was it? What happened? They killed Shinta. What should we do now? They will never let us go that easily. Never. I saw it myself. Mother healed Fajar... ...who was blind. Mother is dying, Lia. Dying? Maybe she is too helpless... ...to do anything to us anymore. But we can't run away from her fanatics. Do you think that is... That's Desta's mother. All of them must be the victims of this sect. Can you imagine... ...what people would sacrifice... ...for what they worship. Mother, we won't let you down. Where is she? What are you doing here? We want to ask Mother for help. Is what Mother has done to you not enough? To all of you. How disappointing. Useless. Maybe our family is looking for us out there. Nobody is looking for us, Lia. We are all alone. We have no one else. No one else? You tried to kill yourself. I'm a junkie. Besides... Outside is not that different from here. Still, we have to get out. There must be some way. Mother will never let you go. I don't care. We have to escape. Sooner or later, they'll find us. They found us. I can't, Lia. I can't. -No... -I can't, Lia. How long do you want to run? Lia, look at me. Look at me. You can't keep hiding, Lia. The only way to survive is to fight back. You have to kill Mother. Leave me here. You can still survive. Go quickly, Lia. Go. Where is she? Where is she? Lia, help! Dewi... Can't all of you really see... ...what you are worshipping? Everybody worships something, don't we? Power... Wealth... Fame... ...but Mother is hope. But not like this. Like what? Sacrificing people. Really? We are not that different. Everybody is willing to sacrifice anything for what they worship. Why me? Because this body is no longer yours. Lia. Help! From now on, this is your home. Bunda will definitely heal Lia. We beg you, forgive us. -We are sorry. -It's too late. Desta, Bunda or them? We have to get out of here, Lia! This is my family. Out there, I don't have anyone. You have me, Lia! No. My family is here now. You have to accept that. Lia, stop! You don't have to do this. Do it, Lia! Do you want to go back to your old pathetic life? Please, Lia! You have a choice. We can run from here and start a new life. Why would you want a new life in this sick world? You only need to kill Mother... ...and she will be reborn in your new body. Don't, Lia! Please, don't do this! Do it, Lia. Lia, I'm here. I will never leave you! Let's go, Lia! Lia, I will stop them. -No... -You have to go now. You can escape this. Trust me. No. Lia, you have to go now. I promise I'll catch up! Promise? Forgive me. You don't have to do this, Sony. Sony, remember! I am your friend. You don't need any of this. Run! What is your name? You really can't remember anything? Not even your name? Hanung has an idea... ...so that Lia would sacrifice herself. -Who is Lia? -You are Lia. Unless, you kill Mother... You are the only one who could get close to her. You don't have a choice. -Mother is dying... -the only way to survive... ...is to fight back. What do you want from me? You have to kill Mother. Mother...
