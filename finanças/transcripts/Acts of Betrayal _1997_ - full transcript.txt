(subdued music) (tense music) - [Man On Radio] Good morning, folks. This is KFR Radio, the voice of Fredricksville Arizona, broadcasting at 650 megahertz on your AM dial. Our new 3,000-watt transmitter now allows me to give a rainy-day hello to our closest neighbors in Wachesaw, 200 miles north. And a howdy-do to the residents of the Lower Mill Valley, 170 miles to the southeast. Hey, it looks like some sunshine is peeking through the cloud cover. Well, there it is. It just might be a sunny day, after all. * Must've taken the wrong winding road * * 'Cause there's a Sycamore tree where the engine used to be * * God's poetic justice, I suppose * * What once was the envy of the showroom * * Is now covered with ivy and crust * - [Man] Gemini to Mars. Pony Express is on the move. - Mars here. Message received. - [Woman] Alerting strike force. - Wake up, people! Let's move it! (pager beeping) Now. Let's go! Get up! Roll off the rocks! Get up! - [Man] All right, boss. - Damn, I miss Iraq. All that nice soft sand. Let's move out! - [Sheriff] Shirley. Yeah, Sheriff Scott here. Yeah, just pulling up to the office. Listen, check my mail. See if my Field & Stream showed up yet. (tense music) - [Man] Sharon reporting. Barney just showed up for work. - [Mars] Affirmative, Sharon. Hydra, double-check and go. - [Hydra] Hydra here. We're at the bank. Right on schedule. - [Mars] Jupiter, report. - [Jupiter] Jupiter here. All is quiet on the Western front. - [Mars] Proceed with Plan A. (suspenseful music) - [Man] Gemini is in position. - [Woman] Sir, Pony Express has passed Checkpoint Alpha. - [Mars] Good. Right on schedule. Now we wait for our Zimbalist. - [Woman] Pluto, keep your eyes open. - I'm gonna invent a butt massage pillow for these extra long trips. Welcome to East Bumfuck Nowhere where Hee Haw isn't just a show, it's a way of life. Yeah, boy. The Bureau could've sent us to Las Vegas, LA. But hey, it's Morelli and Cooper, masters of the barnyard, king of the goddamn country road. (laughs) That's a joke, Lance. You're supposed to laugh. Lighten up. Enjoy life while you can. Breaks my heart to see you wasting away. I mean, it's not like I enjoy preaching the gospel life to you. I'm generally the kind of fellow that likes to mind his own business. You know, pull my own toilet paper. (country music on radio) Okay, okay, all right. I will shut up, but, brother, you gotta turn that bullshit off. Oh, my. Waa, waa, hee, haa, haa. Oh, man. Please. - [Pluto] Mars, this is Pluto. Clavin has arrived. (upbeat music) - Hi, cutie. - [Mailman] Hi, Ms. Ramirez. - [Ramirez] How are you doing? Got something for me? - [Mailman] Here you go. - Thanks a bunch. Hey, Agnes. Hearing aid down again? (laughs) - [Pluto] Pluto reporting. Lucy just got her check. - [Lance] 114 Dumont, no description. - It's simple. Look for the blandest house on the street. Standard government issue. Aha, what did I tell you? (knocking on door) - [Lance] Morning, ma'am. Agents Cooper and Morelli. - Any ID? - Yeah. - About fucking time. What took you so long, stopped for donuts? - [Pluto] Pluto here. Lucy's got company. Looks like two Zimbalists. One's white, late 20s. The other's black, mid 30s. - Nice house. Sort of reminds me of your place. - You're kidding, right? The FBI placed me in this house. Might as well be living in a trailer park. By the way, I hope you guys have a very big trunk. My old man Tony used to bitch about my overpacking, but what can you do? You are what you wear. Not that it matters in this hick town. Around here, they have two fashion statements, burlap and flannel. They think tres chic is a god in Saudi Arabia. You feds promised me witness protection and instead, you gave me a two-year sentence in Green Acres. I've had it with this place. It's the most boring town in America. Now, what should I wear to meet those idiots in Washington? Can't believe those people. Fucking people. Don't squint so hard, baby. You might hurt your eyes. I can't wait to get out of here. Where's my shoes? Can't find my shoes anywhere. Oh, I have to stop by the bank. - The bank, ma'am? - Is there an echo here somewhere? Yeah, the bank. Uncle Sam, he sends me a little paycheck every Wednesday, so I want to cash it ASAP. So, what time did you guys say the flight was? What? - Are you finished dressing yet. Ma'am? - Oh, a Boy Scout. You ever seen that before? - You are a class act, ma'am. - Takes one to know one, baby. - Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to wear this. Standard procedure. - Yeah, right. I'm gonna flatten my boobs like flapjacks. Nope, I don't think so. Okay, ready to go. Well, I'm gonna miss waking up every morning to the smell of horse shit. Not. - Ms. Daisy. - [Pluto] Pluto here. Lucy is on the move. - Hydra, this is Mars. Synchronize forces and execute Plan A. Go. (tense music) (air hissing) - [Sharon] Sharon here. Barney has been disabled. I'm moving into position. - [Ramirez] Look at this town. It makes Tombstone look like Paris. No movie theater for a hundred miles. Want to meet a guy not called Bubba or Moose? Well, good luck. Are you coming? - One agent accompanies the witness, one stays in the vehicle. Standard procedure, ma'am. - Standard procedure? Is this guy for real? Oh, forget it. - One of the best agents in the Bureau. Of course I am the sexiest. - What a waste. He looks like he's got a flagpole stuck up his ass. Look at him. So handsome and so dull. What the boy needs is a good blowjob. - I've been feeling a little tense myself. - Oh, don't get your hopes up or anything else. (chuckles) Friggin' hayseed convention. You know what's great about living in a small town? - [Morelli] What's that? - Absofuckinglutely nothing. How you doing, hon? (tense music) - [Morelli] I'll just be right over here. (gun cocks) - [Mars] All right, high noon. (gun fires) (screams) - [Hydra] Freeze! Keep you hands where I can see 'em. - All right, all right, I'm cool. I'm cool. - Okay, people. This is what you think it is. Everyone on the floor. - [Robber] Shut the hell up! - Don't trip any alarms. Anyone makes a sound, we kill you and the person next to you. If I hear a word coming out of any one of you, I'm gonna stuff every one of you motherfuckers. - Let's go, let's go, let's go. - [Hydra] Janice, get the cash, I'll hit the safe. - [Robber] Who's talking? You wanna die? - Now, who's the motherfucking branch manager? - [Woman] Mr. Hastings. - You, fat boy? I like fat boys. More to kill. What do you think's faster, fat boy, you or a Teflon coated bullet? - Damn it, Morelli. What the fuck is this now? - [Morelli] Take it easy, take it easy. Just let 'em get the money. - What do you mean take it easy? It's my money they're taking, okay? - Shut the fuck up. Any more noise, I'm gonna start killing one at a time. You got it? - Oh, Charlie Hastings. President and fat boy. Open up the safe. - [Charlie] I don't know the combination. (gun fires) - Does that refresh your memory? No? Fat boy needs a little incentive. Jupiter, bring in another rube. - [Jupiter] Move it! - [Robber] Don't even think about it. - Fat boy, or I'll kill another customer every 30 seconds. Fat boy, are you gonna take all day long, huh? Are you trying to mess with me? Is that what you're doing? - [Charlie] No, sir. I wouldn't do that. Just give me another minute. Please, just a minute. - [Hydra] See this nice lady? In a few seconds her nice brains are gonna be splattered all over your nice carpet. You think I won't do it? You think again. I'll snuff all of you white trash rednecks. - [Charlie] I've almost got it. See, I'm almost there. - Any of you hicks move and you're dead. Do you think I'm stupid? (gun thuds) I need to impress on you how serious we are. Kill that lady in red. (gun fires) (woman screaming) (guns firing) Janice, take out these inbreds. (grunting) Kill her! (gun firing) Kill her. Don't let her get away. (yelling) (gun firing) - [Mars] Cover the front door. (guns firing) - [Ramirez] Come on, Morelli. Why don't you help me? (tense music) (yelling) (guns firing) - Zimbalist! Take him out! (guns firing) - Yes, Cooper. What's going on, Cooper? What's going on? Who are these people? Cooper, tell me what's going on. - Oh, god, Beau. - You keep him pinned down, I'll flank him. Do you understand? - [Lance] Beau, Beau. God, Beau. - Who blocked my car? Who the hell's pile of shit is this? You damn woman. - [Man] Barney Fife is heading your way. ETA at the bank, eight minutes. Moving to standby position. - Go. (gun firing) - Don't you die on me, Beau. - This is no bank robbery. These guys are pros. It's a set-up. It's a set-up. The woman. The woman. - Oh, yeah, right. Blame it on me now. - Look at me, Beau. It's gonna be all right. Beau! (gun firing) Damn it, Beau. (gun firing) - Shirley, look, call Tucson. See if you can get some backup. - Neptune, intercept communication. - [Neptune] Roger, we are tapped in. - [Woman On Phone] Tucson State Police, this is Fredricksville. Come in, please. - This is Tucson State Police Headquarters. - [Woman On Phone] We have a bank robbery in progress. We need help. - Affirmative, Fredricksville. You may be in luck. I've got some federal boys in the vicinity. I'll try and reach 'em. They might make it in 10. (gun firing) - This is not working. This guy is packing more than the regulation two mags for a Zimbalist. We keep trying to bleed him, he keeps coming back like the battery bunny. - [Mars] Keep him pinned down. I'll send backup. - [Woman] Converge on the bank. What's your ETA? - [Man] ETA two minutes. - [Mars] Hydra, backup will be there in two minutes. Keep them pinned down. (guns firing) - Keep your head down. - [Mars] Pluto, Sharon, report. - [Pluto] One minute away. Over. - [Mars] Hydra, backup is one minute away. - Fine. Oh, fine. Oh, fine. I'm almost out of bullets. - We have to get out of here. All right, we go on a clip change. When I say now. (guns firing) (metal clicking) Now! Go! Move, move! - Backup, backup. How far away are you? - [Pluto] ETA 30 seconds. - Goddamn it, backup. Move your ass! (guns firing) Shit! Mars, they're out in the open. - Shit. - Pluto, they're coming your way. Plan B. - Strike force, Plan B is a go. Hydra, pursue. Janice, clean up. (gun firing) (tires squealing) (gun firing) - You dickhead! You call this witness protection? Blow it out of your asshole! (gun firing) - I've got 'em pinned down. You flank 'em. - Hydra, we have a visual. - [Hydra] Move it, move it, move it. - [Mars] Hurry up, damn it! Cut 'em off! - What? What? You're gonna get me killed, you pea brain. - FBI, ma'am. I'll drive. (guns firing) Get down! Come on, down! - What the hell are you doing? (tires squealing) Okay. Okay, let me go, Cooper. Oh, God. - [Lance] Stay down. - Please, Cooper. Would you mind not stuffing my face in your crotch? If you want it that bad, you should be asking nicely, Cooper. Who knows, maybe I'm excited by gunfire. Maybe I'm just in the mood. - It's clear. You can sit up now. - [Ramirez] Are you sure? - Yes, yes. Yes, I'm sure. - Oh, God. You're the first man who ever shooed me away from there. Are you gay? - [Lance] No. - [Ramirez] Hey, it's okay if you are. - [Lance] Not that it's any of your business, but for the record I am not gay. - [Ramirez] Touchy. - Federal Agents Weaver and Spencer. No escalation unless I initiate. - By definition, I'm not an amateur. - I know you're not. No offense intended. - Stay back, boys. - Is he dead? What happened? (tense music) Oh, my god. Somebody call an ambulance. - [Sheriff] Are you the feds Shirley called in? - Agent Weaver. This is my colleague Agent Spencer. You okay, Sheriff? - [Sheriff] They're all dead in there. I know all them people. I know their families. - Jesus. - Kane and Brody did this. It's gotta be them, Weaver. Same MO. - Who? - Couple of psychos the Bureau's been tracking for months. Rumors placed them in this area, but we never thought... Sheriff, I realize you're in charge here. I don't want to step on any toes, but I'd love to give you a hand in nailing these bastards. - I could use every hand you got. - We have associates in the area. We'll call 'em in. Sheriff, we'll confer in your office in an hour. - [Sheriff] Sure. - I've never been through anything like this my whole fucking life. Well, looks like you lost my relatives, baby. - I'll contact the Bureau, get help. - Oh, screw the Bureau, will ya? Grow up. Everybody's on the take. Players switch sides. - Yeah, I can clear this mess up with one phone call. - Yeah, right. Right. Okay, Einstein. Go make your phone call. I've gotta go pee anyway. - [Man On Radio] All units, Code One. Stand by for a 211 broadcast for Fredricksville. - Hydra, this is Mars. Come in. - Affirmative, Mars. We, um... We lost her, sir. They're mobile now. - There is only one route out of this godforsaken place, so proceed with Plan B. Divide your forces, set up roadblocks, and them off before they reach civilization. - We won't miss her this time, sir. - We just have to go to the next level of the game. - This is not a game. Games are for amateurs and children, not professional soldiers. Worst thing we can do is take our enemy too lightly. I've seen infantry get butchered because they underestimated the enemy. I'm not going to let that happen under my command. I didn't mean to insult you. I apologize the second time today for lecturing you. You know no one thinks more highly of you than I do. - [Hydra] All right, fall in. Tango Unit, comb the fields between here and the highway. Bravo Unit, hit the road heading north. Report in to me every 10 minutes. Let's go. (engine revving) - [Man On Radio] Shootout at the Fredricksville Western Bank left at least eight people dead. Police are giving the following description of the suspects. One male six foot, late 20s, light brown hair. One Hispanic female, brunette, five foot six. Both should be considered armed and dangerous. Now back to our regular news. - Where are the restrooms? Thanks. - [Attendant] Little lady all right? - She'll live. Fill it up. - [Man On Radio] Misrepresenting the facts and challenging the government to present any witnesses to support their accusations. - [Woman On Phone] Operator 123. How may I help you? - Collect, Agent Cooper. - [Operator On Phone] Hold, please. - [Woman On Phone] Federal Bureau of Investigations, Special Operations Unit. - [Operator On Phone] Collect call from Agent Cooper. Will you accept? - [Woman On Phone] Yes, we'll accept. - [Lance] Deputy Bureau Chief Crispin. - [Woman On Phone] Hold the line, please, while I connect you. (inspiring music) (phone rings) - Crispin. - [Woman On Phone] Sir, Agent Cooper is calling. - Yeah, put him on. Cooper, what's going on? Why aren't you calling on a secured line? - Sir, I'm in a hell of a storm down here. We walked into an ambush with the witness. And, sir, Morelli's dead. - Oh, Jesus. Listen, son. There's something you better know. The woman is Evan Debenedito. - [Lance On Phone] Any relation to? - Yeah, Tony Debenedito, the mobster. His wife. - [Lance On Phone] Now I understand. - Yeah, she helped to put him behind bars for the better part of the next millennium. - Sir, I need support ASAP. These guys are pros, they'll be tracking us. - [Crispin On Phone] Son, listen to me. I want you to hunker down somewhere. What's your 20? - I'm at a gas station. 21st mile marker, just off Route 66. - [Pluto] Pluto here. Good news, we have a location on Lucy. Bad news, the Zimbalist phoned home. - Make your move. - Saturn, target is located at gas station four miles east of your present location. Lock in. - [Saturn] Saturn here. Copy that. We're on our way. - All right. There's an army science facility about five miles south-southwest on Highway 66. - [Mars] Move in. Remember, focus on the woman. Don't let the Zimbalist distract you. - It's nothing more than a glorified weather station, but it's not far from where you are. I can call ahead, they'll be waiting for you. Can you make it? - Yes, sir. I think so. - Good. Good, Cooper. Be careful. I'm on my way. I'm personally coming out there to get you. - [Lance On Phone] Yes, sir. - Okay. Now look, you're good and you're smart, so you're gonna make it. You will do what you have to do. - I will do what I have to do, sir. (gun cocks) - Y'all stay real steady now. There was a bank job back in Fredricksville, you got lots of little holes in the back of your car. Man would have to be simple not to put two and two together. - [Lance] Look, Wally. That's your name, right? I wanna show you something. - Not so fast, mister. - You got it all wrong. I'm FBI. - Just throw that over here. I'm gonna reach for it. Now don't get smart on me. (chuckles) I've seen ads selling stuff like this in the back of magazines. - I'm Agent Lance Cooper. Now listen, Wally. - [Wally] Hey, who the hell are you guys? - Whoa. Hold on. Relax, friend. Federal agents. - [Wally] What do you want? - [Pluto] See? We're pursuing some bank robbers. You caught 'em. - [Lance] Hold on. Don't trust these guys. - Is this one of yours? - Nope. That there's a fake. This guy's lying to you. - Ha, knew it. - Don't listen to 'em, Wally. They're lying. Just keep that gun on them. I'll call for help. - [Pluto] Nobody's calling anybody. This guy's a con man as well as a thief and a murderer. Now, put the gun down. We'll take it from here. - Don't do it, Wally. They're lying. Just hold your ground, okay? Keep them covered. - [Wally] Jeez, I don't like any of this. (grass rustling) Hey, what's she doing over there? (guns firing) (gun fires) (yells) (groans) (explosion booms) (grunts) - [Man On Radio] Both sides brace for tomorrow's congressional hearings. Senator Ivanovitch has dismissed the allegations against him as politically motivated and seems confident of the outcome of tomorrow's anonymous witness testimony. - [Mars] Patch me through to Zeus. - [Zeus On Phone] Mars, give me good news. - [Mars] Sir, we are experiencing some temporary difficulties. - [Zeus On Phone] What? If that woman isn't dead within the hour. - Sir, you have my word. The target will be eliminated quickly and cleanly. - [Zeus On Phone] And I give you my word, Mars. Screw this up and I'll take you down with me hard. You got that? - [Mars] Yes, sir. (tense music) (breathing heavily) - Eva! - Oh, fuck. Get lost, you stupid son of a bitch! Go die by your fucking self! - [Lance] You're coming with me! - No, I'm not. For what? Huh? You're nothing but a fucking delivery boy. - Yeah? Well, I'm delivering you. Oh, oh. Thank God. Hey, hey! (whistles) Hey, look at me, I'm here! - [Taurus] Mars, this is Taurus. We've got her cold. - Do it. - Hey! (gun firing) Fuck! (bones crack) (gasps) You want me? Come and get me. (yelling) (metal crunching) - You okay? - Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine, okay? Fuck, man. You know, you win. I'm not a class act, okay? Second time today I almost end up dead and what you really care about is the fucking way I sit. Fuck it, let's go. You're stupid, you know that? Maybe I'm not a class act, but you are not much of a gentleman. - Two highway patrol cars approaching town. - Eliminate the phone service. Jam all police bands. Call Janice back and have him intercept the patrol cars. (metal clinking) (siren wailing) (tires squealing) (gun fires) - [Policeman] We're under fire. (gun fires) - [Janice] Janice to Mars. Friday's sound asleep. - Okay, okay. Janice, back to the playground. - See? Just a matter of time. Best team always wins. - Let's not take any chances. Put more players in. Commit more backup. (pager beeping) - Yo! You guys, listen up. We're going hunting. Biskane, take second team. The rest with me. Let's rock and roll! (men whooping) - [Eva] Oh, God. I hate walking. I'd love a taxi right now. You know, in the old days if I had to go the 50 yards from Bergder to Bendel's, Tony would have a limo right there waiting for me. He knew how to treat a lady, unlike some people. Are you listening to me? Huh? - [Mars On Radio] All units in the field, give me a sitrep. - [Koff] Koff here with the first team. Sector 7G clear. - [Hydra] This is Hydra. I'm in sector 8H. No sign of Lucy. - [Man] Second team reporting. Sector 2F clear. - Hydra to Mars. Picked up their trail Sector 4G heading north by northwest. - [Woman] Closest units are section 6G and 7H. They're still 10 minutes away. I'm arranging an intercept. - So, where are we off to, baby? Puerto Vallarta, Tahiti, Vegas? Oops, sorry. I forgot. No money, no car, no guns. I know where we're going, straight to hell. - [Lance] You always like this or is today just a good day? - No. No, Mr. Tight-Ass Fed. I'm only like this when folks try to shoot, stab, run over, and basically kill me. Only then I'm like this. - With a personality like yours, I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often. - Oh, a comeback. Wow. You know, maybe you're not as dumb as you look. And maybe you even know where we're going, do you? - There's an army weather station about eight miles off. My boss is gonna pick us up there in a few hours. - Over that hill? I mean, do I look like a mountain goat? Okay. Okay, Mr. Cooper. I mean, you know. You're supposed to say, no, ma'am, you do not look like a goat, you look like a beautiful woman. All right. Then, you know, you're supposed to (laughs) laugh like what I just said was a joke, okay? Well, okay, listen to this. I am staying here because I am very tired and I don't give a fuck what you say. And I don't really care what you do, okay? And I don't want to walk anymore with you or nobody else. I don't give a fuck what you think or anybody thinks. Ouch! - You don't. - I don't what? - Look like a goat. - Oh. Thank you. Thank you very much. - [Man] First unit moving to coordinates. Eight minutes to intercept. (engines revving) - [Man] Copy that. Second unit on the move. We'll be there in 10. - [Hydra] This is Hydra. Close in on Sector 4G. I'm on their trail. - Ouch. My legs are killing me, Cooper. Can we just rest for a second here? - No. I'm supposed to deliver you and I will deliver you. You will testify tomorrow. - Why? Ouch. Why is this so damn important to you? - Because it's my job and that's what I'm supposed to do. - Yeah, right. And you always do what you're supposed to do. Fuck, man. I mean, that's so fucking boring. - [Hydra] Hydra here. I've located Lucy. Northwest corner of Sector 4G. Converge on my coordinates, stat. - [Eva] I'm so thirsty. - We'll have to go this way. - Okay, Mr. Cooper. I can handle it. (tense music) - [Mars] Hydra, report. - I'm trying to get a good shot. Stay fucking still, bitch. - Cooper, I'm dying. No, I mean, this is serious. I am. I'm very hungry. - Keep away from the trees. Just lean forward. Stay still. - I'm thirsty, Cooper. Cooper! - Damn it. - You know, I'm talking to you here, okay? Are you deaf? I mean, you know, I'm talking to you and you haven't heard a word I've said. Will you look at me when I'm talking to you? And ever since over there, I've been trying to be nice to you and not complain. (gun fires) Help me. - Listen to me. Listen, listen. (gun fires) - Help me. - Mars, send me backup. I've got 'em pinned down. (gun fires) Northwest corner of Sector 7G. - Move in, everyone. - [Man] First unit here. Four minutes away. (gun fires) - Listen. They're firing 50 caliber shells from a sniper rifle. Probably a Barrett M82A1. It'll put a hole the size of a grapefruit in that lovely body of yours. (gun fires) - How do you know all that? Are you fucking crazy?. - Marines. I was a sharpshooter. (gun fires) - Do you really think I have a lovely body, huh? (gun fires) - We've gotta find that army shelter. - Come on, you guys. I can't keep 'em pinned down here forever. - [Man] Hold on. We're only two minutes away. (gun fires) (gasps) (gun fires) (engines revving) (gun fires) - 15. (gun fires) 16, 17. (gun fires) 18. - Let go of me. (gun fires) - What are you doing? - 19. (gun fires) 20. Let's go. - Oh, God. I'm gonna get killed. - Mag change. Let's go. - I'm gonna get killed. - [Hydra] Damn it, they're gone. Who the hell is this guy? - [Man] Where are they? - [Hydra] They got away. This guy's good. - [Mars] Silence. They can't have gotten far. Cross the sector and flush them out. Move. - Don't worry, once we get out of this, the Bureau will set you up somewhere quiet. - Yeah, right. Dream on, sweet cheeks. I've given this a lot of thought and I'd prefer to run my whole life than to be Eva Ramirez one more friggin' minute. - You should've thought of that before you rolled over on your husband and his extended family. - Hey! Hey, you motherfucker. You motherfucker. It was you feds who set me up. I wouldn't talk, not a word. So you guys told Tony that I had already spilled my guts and then he sent some people to kill me, okay? So then I didn't have a choice, did I? - No, there's always a choice. You are what you do. Everything else is just talk. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - And who made you Pope, huh? No skeletons in your closet? A little payoff here and there, huh? No hanky panky behind the wife's back, huh? Bullshit! You think you're perfect. Ha. Yeah, right, I doubt it. Nobody is. For the right price, you'd betray everything. You just haven't been tempted, that's all. Huh? - This Zimbalist, what's so special about him? Why is this so difficult? Could this be a trap? No. Is that his profile coming in? - Mm-hmm. Lance Cooper. Former staff sergeant, US Marine Corp Recon, sharpshooter, light and heavy weapons, hand to hand, Panama, Desert Storm, Silver Star, Purple Heart, four years with the Bureau. Lost his wife. Raped and murdered in their home. Seems that Cooper took the law into his own hands. Disciplinary action, reassigned. - So, the system has already let him down once. Shame. Spread the word. This is no ordinary Zimbalist. Combat veteran, Semper Fi. A worthy enemy. I'd like to have met him. A fellow warrior. - So how far, Cooper? Just over the hill. Testify, they said. We'll protect you, they said. Yeah, right. They didn't fucking tell me anything about climbing Mount Everest. If these guys wind up killing me, they would really be doing me a favor. I'm not kidding, I'm not. Two and a half years of playing a goody two shoes country girl. I was dying of boredom. Well, at least this is quicker. What did you just look at Bigfoot? - They're boxing us in. Whoever's running this op is a military man. These guys aren't regular mob muscle, they're pros. Somebody's paying a lot of money to keep you quiet. - I told you my mouth is like a trumpet. Walls of Jericho be shaking, baby. - We gotta make it over by nightfall. Link up with my boss. - Fucking be-whoopity-doo your boss. You think he's gonna get us out of this mess? What's that Boy Scout motto? Pray for the best and spread disaster. Is that what it is? - It's be prepared. - Oh, same shit. Ow, my shoe. Fuck. - [Man On Radio] This is Tucson Control. All cleared for landing, Hero One. - [Man] Sir, your team is waiting for you. - [Crispin] Any word from Agent Cooper? - [Agent] No, sir. - How far away are we? - [Agent] About two hours, sir. - Damn it. Can't this crate move any faster? Floor it, let's go. (gun cocks) (breathing heavily) Oh. Oh, a road. Thank God. It's gonna be so much easier now. Water, Cooper. Hot meal. Even army food will taste good about now. What? Where are you going? What are you doing? Can't you read? I mean, look. I mean, the weather station is that way. - You know, silence is a virtue. - Yeah? Well, virtue's boring. If silence is a virtue, that's why I'm such a blabbermouth. Blah, blah, blah, blah. What are you doing now, huh? Will you? (engines revving) - [Lance] Come on, let's go. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. (breathing heavily) Ow, my legs. - [Lance] No. We'll go this way. We want them to follow us. - What do you mean you want them to follow us? - Come on. - No, no, no, no, no. No, I don't want to get wet. - Come on, come on. - No, no, no, no. I don't like the water. Ah, there's a million little bugs underneath the water. Let go of me. Aye yi yi yi. Ah. Oh, it feels so good. - Come on. Eva. (engines revving) (tense music) - Mars, this is Team Two. We've picked up the enemy's trail. Come on. (engine revving) - I had a dog who used to do that all the time, you know. I had to put him to sleep. Just kidding. God, smile. It's just a joke. - [Man] Second unit here. We're closing in. - Hey, Cooper. Is this big enough? Tarzan! Is this big enough? - Yes, ma'am. - [Eva] Okay. (grunts) (dramatic music) (grunts) - Your marine's putting on quite a show. (grunting) - Fuck. (grunting) Shit, girl. You're out-classed. (bones crack) Fuck. Cooper, did you see that? Did you see that? Fuck me. Fuck, a bike. Can I drive it? Can I drive it, please? - I'm sure you're a fine rider, but I've done this before. - Well, me too. - It's my job to protect you. Get on. - Oh, yeah? - [Lance] Yeah. - Well, will you take a bullet for me? - I'd rather not, but if I have to. - Well, how romantic. Let's go. Yeah! - [Mars] Come in Unit Two. Team leader, do you copy? - [Koff] Mars, this is Koff. They slipped through. - [Mars] This is an embarrassment. - [Koff] There's a bike missing. They're mobile again. - We could've nailed them here, here, or here. - Sir, he's on a motorbike on rocky terrain. Average speed, 25 miles an hour. - That puts them within this radius. Koff, sweep through sections D through H. Look under every rock. And don't fucking fail again. - [Koff] Roger that, Mars. Moving in. (upbeat music) - [Lance] Hey, hey. Cut that out. - What? - This is not the right time for you know. - Oh, Cooper. Any time is good for you know. And anyway, I am just being me, all right? I mean, I didn't get to be me for two and a half years. Anyway, I'm not trying to, like, you know, pull down your pants and jump on you. Well, unless you beg me to. God, can you loosen up? We just killed those people over there and maybe in half an hour they want to kill us too, so why can't we just be friends? Huh? - The weather station is still 25 miles away. Step on it. Nobody opens fire without my say so, all right? - [Agent] Yes, sir. - You're Agent Cooper, you're on a bike, enemy troops are everywhere. What do you do? - Two possible windows. The creek, follow it downstream. The shores are smooth allowing for peak bike performance, eventually it leads to the highway. - Drawback, we could ambush him at the first bridge. - Or he could retreat, say, to the old factory here. Hide out till dark, try to slip through our net. - Drawback, he'd be backing himself into a corner, trapping himself. Here or here, but which? - [Man] Mars, we swept sectors E through H. No sign of Lucy or the Zimbalist. - Agent Cooper's a marine. What do they say, take the high ground? - Hydra, we have reason to believe that Cooper and the mark have retreated to a factory a mile from your present location. Surround the place and wait until I get there. - [Hydra] Hydra here. ETA at the factory, eight minutes. - [Janice] Janice here. Linking up with first unit and converging on the factory, sir. In pursuit to be at the factory in about 10 minutes. - Okay, now we're into it. - [Koff] Bravo Two with eight minutes away. - [Man] Copy that, Koff. We'll be there first. Cover the grid before they get here. (gasps) (engines revving) - [Lance] Change of plans. They've figured out our course. We'll have to ditch the bike and hide out. We'll use the dark as cover. - [Eva] How long are we gonna stay here? It's cold. - We'll hold up here till daybreak. Check the bike for a flashlight. - Where are you going? - [Lance] Set up a little insurance. - Insurance? Men. - [Koff] Koff here. My team's ETA to the factory six minutes. - Now what, Cooper? What a dump. Reminds me when Tony and I did to for the first time. - [Janice] Janice here. I'm with Unit One. Four minutes away. (tense music) - [Mars] I want all units to create an offensive perimeter around the factory. Don't move a muscle until I get there. Copy that? - [Man] We copy that, Mars. That is a roger. - [Lance] Here. This should be safe. Front door is secured and we can see everything. - [Eva] This is the first time all day people are not trying to kill us. My poor feet. Oh, they're killing me. Oh, look at my legs. It's gonna take me forever to get rid of all these bruises. - Can you try and sit like a lady for once? - Aye, what the fuck's wrong with the way I sit? Huh, Cooper? I mean, God. What is the problem? Doesn't your wife ever sit like this just to tease you a little bit, you know? - No. She's gone. - Oh, poor you. What'd she do, run away with an insurance man, marry him, have two and a half kids and a dog? - No. She died. (subdued music) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Mom always said that I had a big mouth. I know. Was she young? - Yeah. - [Eva] I'm sorry, Cooper. I had no idea. - [Hydra] Hydra in position. - [Mars] Good. Janice, move into position. All other units, cover every exit. No gaps. I want that place locked up tight. - [Hydra] All units are in position. Offensive perimeter is established. - Okay, okay. Command station has reached the target zone. Prepare to commence a full-scale assault. - It's freezing. Cooper, um... What a fucking day we've had. For a while there I thought you would betray me, but now... Cooper, I want to ask you for something, but I don't want you to think like I'm coming onto you or anything like that. You know, it is fucking cold here, okay? I mean, I am cold. Besides being hungry, and thirsty, and tired, and everything. I was just wondering if you could, like, hug me or something, you know? I just need a little bit of body heat. I promise, I'll behave. I'll be a good girl. Besides, I am not feeling too sexy right now. I'm not. I'm just cold. (subdued music) See? I don't bite, unless you want me to. I am just kidding, Cooper. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. God. You're so fucking serious, man. You know? You know, Cooper. Once you get to know me, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep down, I'm not really that bad. - [Mars] All units, establish fire base. Neptune, set the detonators. - If we have the luxury, can I claim Lucy? - The kill is all yours. (tense music) Get ready to attack on my command. - [Hydra] Copy that, Mars. - [Man] Copy that. - [Man] Roger, Mars. (clock ticking) - [Mars] All units, move in. (gun firing) - They're here. - Janice has uncovered the Zimbalist, sir. Come on, move in. - No, there's too much gunfire. Cooper knows he's outnumbered. He wouldn't be wasting ammo. Pull back. It's a diversion. - [Eva] What is it? - [Lance] I don't know. - Cooper, I thought you said that we were gonna use the darkness as cover. And for a second I was beginning to trust you. Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid. - [Lance] Could be an animal. Maybe. (explosion booms) (engines revving) - [Hydra] Move in. All of the mobile units, cover me. Flank left. Find the woman. - Shit. - What's happening? Where are they now? - They're surrounding us. - Oh, shit. I can't believe I got us into this mess. We're gonna die in this shit hole in the middle of the. - Shh, shh, shh. They'll hear you. Listen, I have to go out there. - No, you're not. You won't leave me here alone. - If I don't go out there, they'll kill us. - What do you mean? - I need your help. - You need my help? Oh, that's rich. You're so funny you kill me. (tense music) - I can take them out, but I need you to cover me. Can you do it? - Do I have a fucking choice, huh? I don't have a choice. Oh, excuse me. I forgot, we all have a choice. Not, wrong. I do not have a fucking choice. - Eva, if you run and you don't cover me, I'm dead. Okay? - Okay, Cooper. - [Lance] Okay? - Okay, don't worry. My ass and this floor have a great thing going on here. Okay. Don't worry. Don't fucking worry. Don't fucking worry. Don't fucking worry. - [Hydra] Remember, the woman is top priority. Take her down on sight. - [Man] There he is! (guns firing) - [Man] He's on the second floor. - Zimbalist is on the loose. We're giving chase. - Excellent. - Do you want me to quarterback or move in? - Move in. Move in. - Everybody, move in. Orders are to focus on the Lucy. Report her sighting to me. - Okay. Fuck. God help me. (tires squealing) (gun firing) - [Agent] Sir, did you hear that? Sounds like gunfire. - Where? Where the hell are they? Turn around quick. It's coming from the other direction. Head for the factory. Move! (gun firing) - I figure the Zimbalist is running solo now. He's trying to bleed us. - Put him down. - Goddamn battery bunny. (gun firing) (yells) - At the risk of stating the obvious, be careful. - Okay. - Koff, come in. Check out the upstairs. We've got a brother on the second floor. Check your fire. (footsteps echoing) - Oh, mother of God. Please, help me. I don't want to die like this. I don't want to die like this. (guns firing) (yells) (glass shattering) - Shit. Cover me! (gun firing) (breathing rapidly) (dramatic music) - Hydra has encountered the Zimbalist. - [Mars] That means Lucy is unprotected. Move in. (grunting) (bones crack) - Cooper, help! - Don't do it. She dies, you die. Think about it. - [Mars] Wait! I think this is what's commonly known as a Mexican standoff. - Let's do it. - Not yet. He has a 50-50 shot at taking one, or both, of us out. Bad odds. - Okay, then let's bargain. - Good idea. We're all professionals. It's been a very exciting game, Agent Cooper. But I'm afraid we have a stalemate. We have the woman, you may, or may not, have us. There is a rational win-win scenario. We just have to flesh it out like grownups. Go easy on the testosterone. Don't make any sudden or drastic moves. - What did you have in mind? (tense music) - Okay, ground rules. Just so there's no crazy gambit, please note my associate is completely protected by Ms. Ramirez's body. You cannot take her out without harming Ms. Ramirez. (muffled screaming) Have we established that? - We have. - Ground rule number two. We except the notion that a deal must be struck. We have to talk, not shoot at each other. So let's talk face to face, up close, to avoid any surprises. Come on out, Agent Cooper. Good. Now we're getting somewhere. - The gun, lose it. - You lose it. We'll get nothing accomplished without an act of goodwill. I'll lower my gun. Your turn. - Shoot him. Shoot him. You son of a bitch. You're gonna give me up, aren't you? You're just like the other fuckers, you son of a bitch. Cooper, you son of a bitch. - Shut up. - Who are you? - [Mars] Name are irrelevant. - I like to know who I'm dealing with. - Trenton Fraser. Used to be Major Trenton Fraser, 82nd Airborne. Surprised, Cooper? You see, we're not that different, you and I. Both professionals, both been fucked by the system. Me, they retired after years of loyal service above and beyond the call of duty, way above. And you, the way they treated you after the death of your wife. Oh, yes. I know about Annie. And believe me, I know what it's like to lay your life on the line for the powers that be only to have them turn their backs on you when you really need them. Fuck them all, son. Take care of yourself, no one else will. Nobody cares. I feel for you, I really do. I'll kill you if I have to, but I'd rather not. We're not going to kill each other over some mobster slut, right? Do you know who she is, Agent Cooper? Not some sweet, innocent housewife blissfully unaware of her scumbag husband's real job. She was Debenedito's right hand. Wifey here was involved in everything. Money laundering, prostitution, murder. She's Lady fucking Macbeth. She's got blood on her dainty little hands. Let us have her. I'll make it worth your while. You'll never have to work another day. Never have to lay your life on the line for. - How much? (gasping) - Good, okay. Let's come to some figure just so we can define the nature of the rest of the conversation. Let's talk numbers. We've established consensus. The lady is expendable. - Like you say, she's no lady. - No lady. You got that right. Shall we say, mid six figures? - Exact numbers. - 500,000. - Not even close. - [Trenton] A cool million. - Two. - [Trenton] Too much. - Two. You have no time to haggle. My backup's on the way. - Deal. Two million. You name the bank and the account. I suggest Swiss, numbered. - [Lance] Fine, arrange it. - [Trenton] I will. You'll have the account information before we leave. The money will be wired in a few days. Then you can do whatever you want. - I can't believe I put up with all this shit for this lady. Excuse me, this class act. Some class act. - [Trenton] Good thing you dislike her. Makes the deed more tolerable. - You better believe it. I won't lose a minute's sleep over this class act. This fucking class act. - [Trenton] Yes, well. I think we have safely established what she is and what she apparently isn't. - [Lance] She's not a class act. - Whatever. - Come on, let's get on with this. - Now, my associate will conclude our deal by firing one shot into Ms. Ramirez's head. A clean kill. Let's not have any knee-jerk reactions. We're all professionals here. We've all seen men and women die before, so no one's going to get suddenly sentimental, right? Don't get blood on you. You don't have time to change clothes. We got straight to the airport. I'll count to three so no one acts out of impulse. She'll fire, then we'll all just walk away. Okay? - Sure. - One. (tense music) Two. - Three. (gun fires) (yelling) (guns firing) - Cooper! (grunts) (yelling) Gun. Got it. You go to hell! Fuck. Cooper. Cooper. Cooper, oh, my god look at you. Oh, God, Cooper. Oh, my god. Look at all this blood. What should I do? What should I do? - Eva. - Yeah, what? - [Lance] Listen. Outside in the vehicle, call for help, okay? - Okay, Cooper. Yes, yes, Cooper. Cooper, listen to me. You know, what he said. You know what he said is not true, don't you? I mean, I didn't know anything, really. I knew Tony was not a choir boy. I really didn't know what was really going on. Do you believe me, Cooper? You believe me, right? - I know. I know. Please, go. - Okay, I'm gonna go for help, okay? You stay here, Cooper. I'm so sorry. I know I talk too much, Cooper. It's just the way I am with me, okay? - [Lance] Okay, go. - [Eva] Don't go. I'll be right back. - I know. I know, I know. (coughs) (groaning) - Trent. Trent. Fuck you. - No, fuck you. (uplifting music) - Cooper! You in here, son? - Sir, I'm here. - Hold on, Cooper. We're coming in for you. (fingers snap) Oh, my god. Hang in there, Cooper. It's gonna be all right. You got them all, did ya? - The woman. - Don't worry about it, Cooper. We'll take care of her now. You've done your job. I've gotta say, Ms. Ramirez. You look a hell of a lot different than I expected. - No, you're making a big mistake. - [Crispin] That's what they all say. (gun fires) - Crispin! Why? - There's a senator called Ivanovitch, he got in bed with the mob 20 years ago. He needed a piece of the Bureau so he could keep himself secure. He found a weak link, me. Ms. Ramirez knew a hell of a lot more than she told at the Deadly Don trials. The director wanted her recalled so she could spill the whole thing in front of the committee. I had to cancel her invitation, if you know what I mean. - I can't believe it. Not you. - Young men with principles become old men with debts. I wanted to let you in on this deal. Believe me, I did. But you're true blue, Cooper. (coughs) You're a Boy Scout. Look at me in the eye and tell me that you'll never talk about this again. If I let you live, if I let you go, that you'll never breathe a word of this to anyone. Promise me that. (subdued music) - I can't. - I know. - [Lance] Sir, no. - I can't. I can't kill him. Damn it. You, kill him. And when you're done, dump him with the bitch's body. - [Agent] Yes, sir. (gun firing) - The bitch is right here, asshole! Cooper. Cooper, come on. Come on, let's go. - Coop. Coop, you gotta help me. You can't leave me like this. I'm sorry. Believe me, I'm sorry. - Cooper, now what? Huh? - Now we go to Washington so you can testify. - And then? - And then there are choices. - Choices, huh? (both laugh) - Yeah. - Did you just smile? Huh? - No, it just hurts. - Yes, you did. I mean, unless that was like a toothache or something. Because if that's a smile, you should, like, you know, do it more often because it looks really good on you. You know, Cooper, I used to have a teacher who would say, smile and the whole world will smile with you. Cry, and nobody's gonna give a fuck. Well, except, of course, if you ever cry, I give a fuck because... Do you think I talk too much? - [Lance] A little. - [Eva] Does it bother you? - [Lance] Not that much. (whimsical music) (engine starts) (uptempo music) (dramatic music) (tense music) (subdued music)
