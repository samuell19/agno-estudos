We could have had our stereos sooner. - Sorry, Charlie. By the way, how's your studies? Remember, no grades, no car. - But Dad, how can I look like a stud if I'm walking everywhere? - Guys, I heard you were annoying Harry again. Now this is the fifth time this month that I've warned you.

He just gave it to me and said to mail it. - Did you see them? - There were five of them, one was a woman too. - (sighs) Why don't you just go to the police? - I heard my dad tell my mom not to go the police. There must've been a good reason. (gentle music) You can get cleaned up here. I guess you can stay here for a while till we figure out what's going on. (gate clatters) (footsteps patter) - My dad was with you in Vietnam? - Yeah, he was a good buddy.

(boots thud) (infant cries) (infant cries) - [Dave] Damn, Michael, what did you do? Damn. - [Soldier] Oh, we can't leave this kid here. He'll die for sure. - Come on, let's get outta here. - Check 'em out before you shoot 'em, goddamn it! - I ain't taking no chances. I don't want to die here. - You killed his mom, and you're gonna leave him here? He's your responsibility! (tense music) It's finally over. - Is it really? - [Tony] Hey, Dad! - Tony, let me introduce you to your Uncle Dave. - Hey, Uncle Dave. - Hey Tony, how you doing? - Hey, Dad told me a lot about you, man.

Do any of your friends have rooms like this? - It's very neat, Tony. - Thank you. - Too neat, sickening neat. - Well, let's take a look at your room. Come on, you gotta see this. - Tony, Tony, wait a minute. Tony, listen to me. I was just kidding, Tony. - This is Charlie's room. Isn't it great? - Well, this is it, nothing special. Been kind of busy lately. - Charlie, haven't you heard of a trashcan before? - Sure, it's right here. It's full right now so everything's on hold. - Why don't you let me help you, and I'll be back. - Sure. Tony, Tony, Tony, what did I tell you, huh? Girls always love the rough old bachelor type. - Yeah. (Charlie laughs) (upbeat music) (water splashes) (upbeat music) (hands clap) (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) - No! - Annie. Annie, I heard you scream, are you all right? - David, someone was just in here. Trying to kill me! - Look, I'm next door. It's safe here. No, one's gonna hurt you.

Annie's parents were killed for a piece of plastic pizza. I want you guys to just stay at home and not get hurt. - C'mon, you promised us. - Yeah, I thought we were supposed to take care of those guys together. - If you really want to learn, you're gonna have to prove you're worth it. - [Together] All right, yeah! - Sure, anything, what do you want? - We'll do anything. - Get on your shins.

It was a tragic experience. - Yeah, I bet. Hey, I heard the Viet Cong were very sneaky. Even the women and kids. They could just kill you like that, huh? - It's true, we had to watch our backs all the time. - So I guess you must have met my mom then. - Of course, I did she... - What about her? Come on, tell me. - She helped us us out in camp. She did laundry, cooking. She'd tell stories about her village. She was great. Then one day she asked us to take you back to America. So I thought that-- - What? She handed me to you guys. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. How can that be possible? - Charlie. - Uncle David, I trusted you. How can you lie to me? Your story is completely different from Dad's. Come on, I want to know the truth. Come on tell me? What are you guys trying to hide from me? - Charlie, come on. Charlie!

You don't try to kill your friends. - I did something terribly wrong, Momma! - What, baby? What, Tank? You can tell me anything. - I robbed a bank, Momma. - Oh, child. What are we gonna do? - Don't worry, we have an idea. But Tank, you need to stay close to the gang so we can find out what the next plan is going to be. - Don't worry, Tank. It'll be all right.

You're gonna have to be patient with this. - Patient. I have been patient, but try telling that to the creditors. - Now listen, when the time is right, the bars will be sold. But in the meantime, you're gonna have to let me handle this my way. - In the meantime, what am I supposed to do? - Honey, just hang in there a bit longer. Trust me, okay? - This is driving me crazy. - Honey, you know what? (lips smack) I think you drive me crazy. (lips smack) - Alan called a meeting yesterday. Because everybody wants their gold bars. But we can't do anything until we find the missing piece of pizza. - Hey, that could be the pizza that Uncle Dave's got. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Who's Alan? - Yeah, who is this guy? - Alan owns that bar by the beach. And let me tell you, he's not an easy guy to deal with. - Thanks, Tank, we'll handle this. - Yeah, keep us informed about all the information going around though. - I will. You guys be careful though, man. - Pizza. Alan's bar. (seagulls caw) (suspenseful music) - Excuse me, we're looking for a guy named Alan. - Is he here? - Excuse me, we're looking for Alan. - Hey kids, you got your ID? (laughs) Or did you bring your mother with ya? (laughs) - We have better things to do than babysit a couple of squirts. Now get lost! - We're not kids, now where's Alan? - Where is he? - Hey, Nick. We got a couple of small problems over here. - What can I do for you boys? - We're looking for Alan. - Alan, there's no Alan here. And we don't serve milk and cookies. - Well, if he's not here, then we'll come back later. - Not so fast, guys. You don't mess around here and then leave. - I think it's time for a little rubdown boys. - Yeah. I think it's time for a little physical education. (man grunts) - I think we have a little problem too. (laughs) - Piece of cake.

(glass shatters) - Are you okay? Alan! - You lookin' for me? You messed up my place! (footsteps patter) (suspenseful music) (wind howls) Okay kids, cut the shit. There's no place else to run. (Alan grunts) (boys grunt) (feet pound) (elbow pounds) (leg whooshes) (foot thumps) (fist pounds) - Don't waste time, give him the pizza. - No, not yet. I want to use some of Uncle David's moves. Let's see how good we are. - Let's go! - Bowling ball. (Alan grunts) (Alan groans) (Alan grunts) (boys grunt) (bowling pins rattle) - Hey, pretty good move, huh? - Hey! - What the hell was that?

I'll have the mold made up. - Well, I think we should all stick together until the safe is opened. What do you guys think? - I think it's a real good idea. - They can all stay here tonight, honey, right? - I don't see any problem with it. Well, Alan, will you do the honors? - My pleasure. (cork pops) All right, send them in. (Jenny cheers) (Jenny laughs) (water bubbles) - Hey, it's late. It's time to go to bed. (lips smack) - There's so much to take care of for tomorrow. - Michael, you've done everything you can possibly do. I mean, after tomorrow, you won't have to think or worry about this ever again. (lips smack) (suspenseful music) (Tank chatters softly) - I think someone's coming, I gotta go. - Yes, I'd like to report information about a bank robbery. Yes, the people who robbed the bank are picking up the gold bars from the Sperry metal refinery. (bird wings flap) (tires skid) (bird wings flap) (tires rumble) (suspenseful music) (footsteps patter) (water splashes) (keys clang) (keys clatter) (helicopter propellers whip) Shit! (helicopter propellers whip) - Damn it, I knew it! I know who snitched. It was you, Tank! - What are you talking about? - You know damn well what I'm talking about! - Look, I didn't call the police! - Bullshit! I saw you on the phone at Jenny's house last night! - I didn't call 'em! - I'll take care of this, Alan. - Michael, I wouldn't do that. (foot thumps) (Tank groans) (boxes crash) Put it up, Michael, I didn't call the police. Please don't kill me, man! - Goodbye, Tank. (gunshot blasts) (glass shatters) - What the hell was that for? - He wasn't worth it. You guys take care of the gold, I'll handle this. (helicopter propellers whip) (men grunt) (vault creaks) - The gold bars are gone! That bastard! Michael! Michael! Where the hell is he? (car doors slam) - [Charlie] Hey look, it's Alan! Come on!

(sirens wail) - Look, Uncle David! - Go ahead and follow him. I'll keep an eye on this guy. - [Officer] Attention in the building! Throw down your weapons and come out with your hands on your head. - [Alan] Shit. (groans) (gunshot blasts) (gunshots blast) (window cracks) (gunshots blast) (Alan grunts) (radio dispatcher chatters) (suspenseful music) (men chatter) - [Dave] What did you get yourself into? - [Michael] Hey, I'm rich, I made it. - [Dave] You call this success? You're a damn murderer! - [Michael] I just do what I have to! If I'm doing something wrong, you're as much to blame. You were always too good to me. You got me everything I wanted. But I got out in the real world. Nothing came easy anymore. I had to struggle to get the money that I wanted to buy me anything. - Come on, Mike, turn yourself in. You've got a chance if you do. - Don't even try to stop me, Dave. Think about it. After 20 years in jail, my life would be over. Stay out of my way! - I can't. I'm not gonna let you go! - I'd rather die than go to jail. - Don't be ridiculous. Let's just cut out the small talk, we gotta get-- - Jenny! - He's gonna turn us in! - No! (feet thump) (gunshot blasts) - Jenny, Jenny! Honey, honey, honey, shit. Charlie! (fists pound) What the hell do you think you're doing? - I'm sorry, Dad. I was just trying to protect Uncle David. - You're nuts, man. How can you do this to your own son? - Don't try to get to me by using Charlie, it won't work! Stay out of my way! - Have you lost your mind? (Michael grunts) (fists pound) (foot thumps) (Dave groans) - Are you okay? - I'm okay. - Stop him! - Dad. (fists pound) - How dare you turn against me? You think you're real tough, huh? Let's see how tough you are. - I'm not turning against you. You're my father. (hand smacks) - Don't try to soften me up. - That's not what I mean, Dad. - You son of a bitch! How can you beat a kid who doesn't even fight back? Just like you killed his mother in Nam! - What, my mother? What are you talking about? It's impossible! Dad. Tell me it's not true. Did you really kill her? - I did it, so what? I've got no time for regrets. Now, if anyone tries to stop me, I'll kill 'em. (thrilling music) (men grunt) (fists pound) (foot pounds) (door creaks) - Uncle David! You okay? - [Alan] Shit! (Alan groans) (handcuffs click) (Alan groans) (suspenseful music) (machine hums) - Michael! - [Charlie] No, Dad!

Anything you say can and will be used against you-- - Dad, Dad! - In a court of law. - Dad, are you okay? What happened, Dad? Answer me! - The kid's gotta go! - [Tony] Let me stay here! - [Officer] Sorry, kid. He's a suspected criminal. - Dad. No, Dad! (Tony cries) - Charlie. - Annie. I'm sorry it turned out this way. - Charlie! How can you do that to my dad, man? He gave you everything. How can you ruin him? Give me back my dad!

(Tony grunts) (foot thumps) You cannot avoid fighting. You must participate fully. This is a warning. Go! (Tony grunts) - Come on, Charlie, fight me! What are you waiting for? Are you afraid of me? You thought you were so good before, tough guy. Well, fight me now! Come on, come on! (Tony grunts) (leg whooshes) (fist pounds) - One point penalty for non-participation. You want to be disqualified? You're a disgrace to the martial arts. We can ban you from competition for two years. Do you understand? One point penalty. (Tony grunts) (Charlie grunts) (foot thumps) (boys grunt) (foot thumps) (leg whooshes) (foot thumps) (leg whooshes) (fists pound) (leg whooshes) (Tony grunts) (fists pound) (foot thumps) (Charlie grunts) (foot thumps) (crowd cheers) (feet thump) (thrilling music) (Tony grunts) (foot thumps) (body thuds) (crowd cheers) (fists bang) (Tony grunts) (foot thumps) (Charlie grunts) (foot thumps) (crowd cheers) - Tony, you okay?
