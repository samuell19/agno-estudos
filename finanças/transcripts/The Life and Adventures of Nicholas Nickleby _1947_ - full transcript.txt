[bells jingle] Good morning, Mr. Noggs. Mournful one for old Nickleby. Only fourpence, though. That will please him. Thank you. Good morning. [Ringing bell] [Knocks on door] Ah. So our friend Mr. Bray doesn't relish the thought of debtor's prison. I thought he'd send the money somehow. He hasn't. Hmm. I know something of that hand. My brother's dead, and the window and both children are in London, confound them! Anything else you want? Not now. I must go out. Reasonable. Very reasonable. Never did anything for me, and I never expected it, but the breath is no sooner out of his body, then the family looks here for support. What are they to me? I never saw them. That will cost you a pretty Penny. I can't keep them. They must find something. If they won't do it for themselves, I shall. [Bells jingle] Is Mrs. Nickleby at home, girl? ♪ Hannah who is wanted? Are you miss la what's her name? Creevy, la Creevy. A miniature, I presume, and a very strongly marked countenance for the purpose. I have no money to throw away on miniatures, ma'am, and no one to give them to if I had. I came to see my sister-in-law Mrs. Nickleby. Oh. Then you want the second floor. Hannah, show the gentleman up. What name? Nickleby. Mrs. Nickleby, here's Mr. Nickleby. Uncle Ralph. Good morning, sir. Nicholas, I suppose. And how do you do, ma'am? Ah. You must bear up against sorrow, ma'am. I always do. Mine was no common loss. 'Twas no uncommon loss, ma'am. Husbands die everyday and wives, also. And brothers, too, sir. Yes, sir, and puppies and pug dogs likewise. [Crying] When my wife died, ma'am, many years ago, I learned to survive the calamity. Doubtless, you will do the same. Well, ma'am, you say in your letter there's nothing left, hmm? And you spent what little you had in coming all the way to London to see what I can do for you. I'd hoped you might do something for your brother's children. It was his last wish. I don't know how it is, but whenever a man dies without property, he seems to think it gives him the right to dispose other people's. And this is Kate. What sort of work is your daughter fitted for? She was the cleverest girl in a school of 25. Or was it 55? Well, anyway, I... We must try and get you apprenticed. And you, have you ever done anything? No, sir. I suppose you are willing to work. Of course I am. Then listen. This caught my eye this morning. You may thank your lucky stars. "Education at Mr. Wackford Squeers' academy, dotheboys hall," and so on and so on and so on. "N.b.: an able assistant wanted. "Annual salary £15. A master of arts would be preferred." There. Let him get that, and his fortune's made. If he doesn't like it, let him get something for himself. But he's not an N.B., M.a., master of arts. That, I think, can be got over. But it's so far away, mama. Shh, Kate. Nicholas, I wish you would say something. If I'm fortunate to be appointed, sir, what will become of my mother, my sister? In that case but not otherwise, they will be provided for by me. Then I'll do anything you wish. I'm very pleased to hear it. We'll visit Mr. Squeers tomorrow. He's in town and attends daily from 1:00 till 4:00 at the Saracen’s head... Every wholesome luxury, Mr. Snawley, that Yorkshire can afford. Every comfort of an home that a boy could wish for. A father in me and mother in Mrs. Squeers. Could I have a few words with you? By all means. Up to what age will you keep the boys? Just as long as the quarterly payments are kept up. What are they, natural children? We have a good many of them. No. They ain't. The fact is, I'm not the father, Mr. Squeers. I'm only the father-in-law, as you might say. I married the mother. Oh, is that it? £20 per annum, I believe, Mr. Squeers. Guineas, Mr. Snawley. Pounds for two, I think, Mr. Squeers. Very well. Payment in advance of course. Uh, they ain't great eaters. Mr. Squeers? Why, it's Mr.... Yes, sir. Won't you be seated? Good day, Mr. Snawley. Ralph Nickleby's my name. You've advertised for an able assistant. Here is my nephew Nicholas, straight from school with everything he learnt there fermenting in his head and nothing fermenting in his pocket. Hmm. I'm afraid, sir, I'm not master of arts. Well, that is an objection. Here. Let me put this matter in its true light. A young man, wholly ignorant of the world. Look at him. Think of the use he can be in half a dozen ways. Your uncle's recommendation has done it, Mr. Nickleby. From this moment you are nominated to and installed in the office of first assistant master of dotheboys hall. Thank you, Mr. Squeers, very much indeed, sir. And thank you, uncle, for getting me this opportunity. I shan't forget your kindness. You better go home and pack up, what you have to pack. The coach starts at 8:00 tomorrow morning. Be here the quarter before. [Crying] Now, now, my little man. There's nothing to cry for. [Cries] Ow! Ohh! [Cries] Man: all baggage ready for the York coach, please. All baggage ready, please. Your milk and water, sir. Twopenn'orth? Here's richness. When I say, "number one," the boy nearest the window may take a drink. Mrs. Nickleby: And she never saw her son again, never in all her life. I was just saying to Kate... No. I won't listen to myself. Just you make yourself useful to this Mr. squires, as I know you will, and you'll rise to be a partner in the establishment in no time at all. Come on, come on, come on hold that noise, boy! I want more breakfast. I'll give you more breakfast! Anybody else want more? No, sir. That's right. Subdue your appetites, my dears, and you've conquered human nature. Oh, there you are. Get them boys on top of the coach, will you? That can't be the schoolmaster surely. He does seem an odd-looking man. So was Dr. Johnson. All these bookworms are. Well, I never expected... I expected to find you here, ma'am. A house of mine in town is empty. I can put you in there rent-free till it's let. Of all the kindness! Do you hear that, Kate? A house, and in town, too. That would be near you, I suppose. East end. Oh. Oh, well, all the same. After all, it's somewhere to live. My clerk Noggs will take you down there as soon as the coach is gone. Oh, thank you. Good morning. Most delightful of you. Furthermore, I've found a situation for Kate with a milliner and dressmaker. Milliner? And dressmaker, ma'am. Mantalini's, a very well-known house. The York coach is leaving now. Hurry up there. Good-bye, uncle. Good-bye, Nicholas. I trust you'll take care of them. Good-bye, mother. Kate, you'll write to me? Bless you, love. Good-bye. [Bell tolling] That's right, Nickleby. You get up on top. I'm afraid of one of them boys falling off, and that's £20 gone. All right behind it? All right. Let her go! [Fanfare] Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Squeers: hello, there! [Horse snorts] Here we are! Nicholas: dotheboys hall, sir? That's it. You needn't call it a hall down here. The fact is, it ain't one. Where the devil have you been, Smike? Please, sir. I fell asleep over the fire. Fire? What fire? Where's the fire? Only in the kitchen, sir. Missus said as I was sitting up, I might go in for a warm. Missus is a fool. We feel more wakeful in the cold. See to the pony, then the boxes, then the boys. Hurry up, Nickleby. This wind's fit to blow you down. [Wind howling] It's cold enough up here, yet the boys is always getting fevers. Obstinacy, that's what it is. Woman: is that my squeery? There you are, me love. And how's my squeery? Quite well, me love. And how are the pigs and the cows? All right, every one of them. That's a blessing. Boys are bobbish, I suppose. Oh, they're well enough. The new young man, my dear. Good evening. Hmm. Better give him a shakedown for tonight. Phoebe! Phoebe! Nickleby, come in here and take your things off. Phoebe! Cubby, Duncans. Ha! What they want writing letters to them boys, I don't know, when they can't read. What do you want? Have you... Has nothing been heard about me, sir? Devil a bit. Not a word and never will be. A pretty thing. Left here all these years and nothing paid after the first 6. Mrs. Squeers: In here with them. We'll put you in your regular bedroom tomorrow. Let me see. Who sleeps in Brooks' bed, me dear? Brooks'? There's Jennings, little bolder, graymarsh, and what's his name. So there is. Yes. Brooks is full. There's a place somewhere, I know. I think that Smike's turning silly. I hope not. He's a handy fella for rough work. That will do, Phoebe. Remember, Nickleby, 7:00 in the morning. I shall be ready, sir. The pump's in the yard. You'll find a bit of soap in the kitchen window. Blow that light out as soon as you can now. Candles cost money. Don't like the look of him, nasty, stuck-up monkey. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! [Knock on door] Come in. Thank you. [Bells ringing] Ah. You've had your breakfast. I've had some porridge, sir. [Belches] Then you're ready for work. I wasn't able to wash. Of course you wasn't. The pump's froze. Never mind. A dry Polish is almost as good. Dreadful things. It's brimstone morning, and I can't find the school spoon anywhere. We purify the boys' blood now and then. Purify, fiddlesticks. We don't buy brimstone and treacle for that. They have it part because it keeps them from ailing and part because it spoils their appetites. It comes cheaper than breakfast and dinner. Here's the blessed thing. He were sleeping on it. A most invaluable woman, that. More than a mother to them boys. [Whip] 10 times more. She does things for them boys that half the mothers going wouldn't do for their own sons. I can well imagine that, sir. We had a boy died here early last winter, young dorker. Mrs. Squeers was as partial to that lad as he'd been her own. The attention that boy got in his illness, the motherly love what was showered on him. Dry toast and warm tea offered him every night and morning when he couldn't swallow anything. That's my son, that is. Little Wackford. The image of his mother and me and a bit more beside. Yes. That boy dorker had a candle in his bed till the very night he died and the best dictionary set up to lay his head on. This is our shop, Nickleby. Mrs. Squeers: No, you don't. All at once, or I'll have the hide of you. Next boy, come on. Please, ma'am. That boy's got my clothes on. That will do! You shut up and mind your own business! Now then. Is that physicking over? Just over. Wackford, you can do that later. Bring the basin and come with your mother. Hurry up. Places. And stop that sniveling, or I'll give you something to snivel for. Well, boys, I've paid my half-yearly visit to London, and you'll be glad to see I've come back as strong and as vigorous as ever. Hip, hip. [Mumbling] hooray. That will do. First class. English and philosophy. Brooks, spell window. W-I... W-I-n, win, d-e-r, der, winder, a casement. Go out and clean them. We go on the practical mode of teaching. When a boy learns his subject, he goes out and does it. Graymarsh, spell botany. Graymarsh: b-o... B-o-t, bot, t-I-n, bottin, n-e-y, bottiney, noun substantive, knowledge of plants. Out you go, and take the snow off the garden paths. You, what's your name, what's an horse? It's a... a beast, sir. So it is. An horse is quadruped, and quadruped's Latin for beast. See that you're perfect in that. Go and look after my horse and rub him down well, or I'll rub you down! It's washing day tomorrow, and I want the coppers filled. The rest of the class, go and draw water until somebody tells you to leave off. Now that's our system, Nickleby. What do you think of it? It's a very useful one at any rate. You're right there. Now just take the second class and explain them some reading. [Indistinct chatter] "The pilgrim's progress." "As I walked through the wilderness of this world, "I lighted on certain place where was a den, "and I laid me down in that place to sleep, and as I slept, I dreamed a dream." Demmit! What, Nickleby! Of course, demmit, I remember. Your niece. Follow me, my dear, will you? They all follow me, always did, demmit, always! Woman: Mr. Nickleby. Good morning. This is my niece, ma'am. I spoke to you about a vacancy for her. You remember? Just so. What work can you do, child? I can turn a hem, ma'am, or sew a seam. And that is all? She can learn. Oh, quite, and I can do with another pair of hands. We keep 20 young women constantly employed here. Yes, and some of them demned handsome, too. Mantalini, do you want to break my heart? My senses' idol! Not for 20,000 hemispheres populated with little, uh, ballet dancers. Alfred. Ahem. The hours are from 9:00 to 9:00. There's extra work when we're very full of business, for which I allow payment as overtime. Your wages shall average from 5 to 7 shillings a week. Yes, madame. You can begin as soon as it's convenient. She can begin now. Oh. Very well. Come into the showroom. There. Now you are provided for. I'm very much obliged to you, uncle. I've merely done my duty. I hope that you'll do yours. I'll do my best. I'm very pleased to hear it. You'll find your way home this evening? Good-bye then. Good day, ma'am. Good day, Mr. Nickleby. Oh, miss Knag, this young person is beginning here today. Try her with some easy work at first. Very good, madame. I quite understand. And she might come into the showroom with you. Her appearance will... It will suit very well with mine. How very clever of you to think of it. That way. Demmit! Who'd have thought old Nickleby would have had such a demned pretty, young creature for a niece, eh? If it weren't for your wicked extravagance, we wouldn't have to keep borrowing from him or employing his poor relations. My life and soul. Ohh! Parrot: demmit! Demmit! [Screeches] You'll work here, miss Nickleby. You better begin by hemming this petticoat. If you want anything, come to me. Thank you. [Tittering] [Woman claps] [Tittering stops] Where are you from? From Devonshire. Oh, I don't mean that. Where did you work before? Nowhere. Oh, nowhere. Oh, superior, aren't we? [Laughter] [Claps] That's enough! Dinner's over! Rise. For what we have received, may the lord make us truly thankful. Amen. Amen. amen. amen. Nickleby, I'm going out. You'll have to take the rest of the classes by yourself. You can do that, I suppose. Yes, Mr. Squeers. Smike. You needn't be afraid of me. You've been here a long time, haven't you? Since I was 5, they tell me, sir. I don't know. Don't you remember your mother your home? No, I don't remember. I don't remember anything. Someone must have brought you here. Your father perhaps. He wasn't my father. I don't think he was. I was afraid of him. I was glad to leave him. Glad? But surely, you're not happy here. Happy? Phoebe: Smike! Beg pardon, Mr. Nickleby. Smike, miss Fanny's back, and you're to fetch her box upstairs quick as you can. ♪ Fanny Squeers is jealous ♪ ♪ Fanny Squeers is jealous ♪ oh, stop it, Wackford. ♪ Hilda price has gone and got spliced ♪ ♪ so Fanny Squeers is jealous ♪ is that you, Phoebe? Where's that lazy hound of a Smike? He were with Mr. Nickleby. Not there. Over here. That will do. Go on outside. ♪ Hilda price has gone and got spliced ♪ ow! You'll never get spliced, you won't. Phoebe! Yes, miss? Was it a pretty wedding, miss Fanny, over to miss price's? Come on. She must have made a lovely bride and done well by herself, too, hasn't she? Well enough for her, I have no doubt. Who's Mr... Nickleby? He's the new assistant. You ought to see him. He's a real gentleman born if ever there was one. The way he talks and acts and carries on. And you've only to look at him. Such beautiful eyes he's got and such a sweet smile, and as for his legs... Phoebe, that's quite enough. Oh, but, miss, you ought to see him for yourself. First, write the address at the top and then the date, 17th of December, 1830. [Knock on door] Come in. I'm sorry, father, but... Oh. I beg your pardon. I thought my father was... or might be... Dear me. How very awkward. Mr. Squeers is out. Oh, how tiresome. I'm sorry I intruded. I'm sure... It must look so very strange. I only wanted my pen mended. Perhaps I can do it for you. Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't put you to the trouble. Hard nib or soft? Such a sweet smile. What did you say? Dear me. I was thinking of something else for the moment. As soft as possible, if you please. Oh. I quite forgot. I'm miss Squeers. I imagined that. Did you really? There's a strong family resemblance. Oh, I beg your pardon. Very awkward of me. Oh, not at all. It's my fault, mine entirely. Very... so embarrassing. I scarcely know what I... Careful. You're biting your nib off now. Oh. Oh, dear me! Fanny: what do you mean, "quick as you could"? I sent for you 10 minutes gone. Don't you run from me, you lying, little pig you! Smike was having his supper. I told him to finish it. If you have any objections, you better make them to me. I didn't see you where there, Mr. Nickleby. It's quite all right of course now that you explained. There's no call to run away. Pa's still out, and ma's with him. You can have a glass of port if you like. Come and sit down. Thank you. I'm going to bed. Nobody's kind to me! I wish everybody was dead! I wish I was dead, too! [Sobbing] [Door slams] [Knock on door] Come in. Mr. Nickleby likes you, doesn't he, Smike? Oh, yes, he does, and you've been having a fine, idle time since he's been here. Wait till I tell father. Just wait! Smike! Where the devil are you? Smike! Where's that Smike? Is he hiding somewhere in here? Smike! He's not here, sir. Where is he then? At the bottom of the nearest pond for all I know. Come on. Someone knows where he is! [Grunt] Sneaking off up the York road, he was. Oh, he was, was he? Each boy, keep his seat. Nickleby, to your place. Stand a little out of the way, my dear. I've hardly room enough. Have you anything to say? I was driven to do it. Oh, driven, were you? Then I'll have to spare you. I'll flog you within an inch of your life and spare you that. Hee hee hee! Ha ha ha! Let that boy go. Hold your tongue! You've done him enough harm. Get back to your desk! I've seen it these last few weeks, nothing but blows and strikes. I'm in my rights! Your rights? To beat and starve these boys? This isn't a school. It's a hell on earth. You young scum! Ohh! I... Mrs. Squeers: Oh, help! He's killing my squeery! Stop it, you dirty hound you. Stop it! Help! [Sobbing] Squeers: ow! Oh! Ow! Ohh! Help! He's killing my squeery! Ow! Stop it! Help! [Sobbing] [Wheezes] Aah! Hoo hoo! [Sobbing] Come, Smike. [Mumbles] [Mrs. Squeers moans] He's dead! He's murdered! My squeery! Squeery! Squeery, say something. [Groans] Fanny: "to Mr. Ralph Nickleby, esquire. "Sir, my pa requests me to write to you, "the doctors being doubtful whether he will recover the use of his legs, "which prevents his holding a pen. When your nephew had done this to him"... Ohh! "And jumped upon him with his feet "and also language, "which I will not pollute my pen with describing, "he assaulted my ma with dreadful violence "and drove her back comb several inches into her head. "The monster, having satiated his thirst for blood, ran away." "Taking with him a boy of desperate character, who he had incited to rebellion." "My pa begs that if he comes to you, "you will let the assassin go, "as he is sure to be hung before long, "which will save us trouble and be much more satisfactory." Pretty. Very pretty. I recommend you against my convictions, and what is the result? Conduct for which you might hold up your hand at the old Bailey. It isn't true! Nicholas, tell him! He was ill-treating the boy. I'd do the same again. Ralph: penitence. I never would have believed it. Mama, please. What have you done with him? Did you take this boy away, or didn't you? The boy's in my charge until I can find him a home or give him one myself. The whole thing proved, even on his own confession. One thing is proved. But uncle! Let me say a world. Of what I have done for you, my niece, or I intended to do, I shall say nothing, but this boy, headstrong and willful as he is, shall not have one Penny of my money! Knowing full well the consequences, he has come back to be a burden on his sister's scanty wages. Very well. I have no wish to desert you, ma'am, or Kate, but I will not help him or those who do help him. But I can't renounce my own son, even if he has done all you say. Mama, you know he hasn't. I don't know what to think. Never mind. We can go to the work house or the refuge for the destitute. Wait, sir. You needn't leave here. I shall be gone in one minute. No, Nicholas! Don't go away again, please. Kate, I never meant to stay here with you. When I'm away, you will be helped. Mother sees that, and she's right. Bless you, Kate. I'm taking you at your word, sir, but if you break it... I beg your pardon. I... I'm in your way perhaps. Oh, no, not at all, thank you, but if I'm in yours... No. There doesn't seem to be very much. No. It's so hard to find work of any kind. You understand of course, my secretary must make himself master of foreign policy, run his eye over all accounts of public meetings, get up a few little arguments now and then on the effects of returned cash payments, the exportation of bullion, the emperor of Russia, bank notes, and all that kind of thing, and then of course wait in the lobby every night in case I need fresh cramming, and during debates, sit in the gallery and point me out to people as the celebrated Mr. Gregsbury and any other little eulogium that might strike you. And for salary in round figures, 15 shillings a week and find yourself there. 15 shillings? That's not much. [Ding] [Knock on door] Door, Matthews. I mean for the duties and responsibilities. Door, Matthews. Secretaries. Nothing else. Tuition? Mr. and Mrs. Kenwigs, to instruct the daughters in French. A shilling per week per each miss Kenwigs and a shilling over until the baby can take it out in grammar. Thank you. My aunt's pen. Le plume de ma tante. Girls: le plume de ma tante. My uncle's... Hold on a minute, sir. Do you consider French a cheerful language? Yes. I'd say that it was. Oh. It's very much changed since my time, then, very much. My uncle's... What is the French for water? L'eau. L'eau. And you call that a cheerful language. Ha ha ha! Shall the gentleman go on, uncle? Oh, yes, yes, let him go on. My uncle's garden. Le jar... [crying] [Crying] The daughters I could manage, even the uncle, but the baby was too much for me. Ha ha ha! I must find real work somewhere, and then there's Smike. He can't go on hiding forever in one wretched, little room. We're leaving London, Mr. Noggs. But I could look after the boy. And bring down trouble on your own head? Better you've never see him, know nothing of him. I must go, but there's one thing I wanted to ask. It's about Kate and my mother. If anything should happen... I'll let you know. You didn't need to ask. Thank you. I'll write to you. I'll send an address as soon as I can. Don't you forget then. I'm not likely to. I haven't so many friends that I shall forget my best one. [Pennywhistle playing] Mind out there! Man: Madeline. Madeline. Hurry up. We haven't all day, Madeline. I'm just coming, father. Let me take those. We met before at the agency. Yes. I remember. Man: Madeline. What is it, Madeline? Who is... This gentleman's just helping me, father. We've no money, young man, it that's what you're hoping for. Please, father. Get the rest of the luggage, and let's be off. Man: just a minute! Oh, no, you don't. Trying to do a flit, eh, trying to queer my pitch for me, eh? I'm not to partial to that kind of lark, see? Leave my father alone. You've no right to. Let him go! Stop that, my little lady. Take your hands off her! That will do, young shaver. This is not your business! I'll soon make it mine! Please! There's nothing you can do. Here's my warrant of debts unpaid to the sum of £1,700, detaining creditors... Yes, yes. There's no need to cry my finances all over the town. You'll accompany me forthwith and present yourself at the king's bench prison before noon. He's not well. I must go with him. If you wants to live with him, you can apply. Go on. Might as well use the hackney. Nicholas: if there's anything I can do, any message to friends. No. There's nothing. You're very kind. I only wish I could do something, too. Thank you. Man: come on. Come on if you're coming. Cheer up, governor. Perhaps they'll live in the rules. The rules? Lodgings just outside the prison. Pay so much a week for the privilege. Giddyap there, doggie. Only 12 more. Tired, Smike? No. I'm not tired. Well, if you're not, I am. Let's try in here. Landlord! I shouldn't have come with you. I'm nothing but a trouble to you. A trouble? You're far from that, Smike. I'm only too glad of your company. You haven't enough money even for yourself. If it hadn't been for me... Yes, gentlemen? We're looking for some supper and a room perhaps afterwards. Supper? I'm a bit short tonight. I'll tell you what. There's a gentleman in the parlor who's ordered a beefsteak pudding and potatoes, and there's more than he can manage. If I ask leave, I have no doubt you could sup with him. We're very dusty and dirty. Oh, lord love you. Why, it's only Mr. Crummles. Smike. Don't you believe what I've said? Tried to go away when we were in London. I couldn't. You want a hot meal and a good sleep, and I want no more talk of that kind, understand, Smike? Landlord: all right. I knew it would be. Come this way, gentlemen. Wait till you see them in here, the way they're going on it. Thrust, parry. Thrust, parry. More fire, boys. Make the spark fly. Under, over. Good work! 1, 2, into him. 1, 2, reverse! 1, 2. That's better. Mr. Vincent Crummles, this is the young gentleman, sir. Aha. Ha ha ha! There's a picture. The little one has him. If the big'un does not counter in 3 seconds, he's a dead man. Bravo, boys, bravo. That will be a double encore. What do you think of that, sir? Very good indeed. If only they were a little better match. Match? Why, that's the essence of the combat, that there should be a foot or two between them. How else are you gonna get up the sympathies of the audience? I see. I beg your pardon. Ah. The ample pleasures of the table. Now, gents, draw up and make yourselves comfortable. I'm glad you thought well of the combat. We open at Portsmouth the day after tomorrow. The company are there already. My son, take your had off. My sons and I are on our way to join them. Where are you bound for? We're making for the coast. We thought if there were nothing ashore we might get work aboard some ship or other. With practiced hands as plentiful as oysters? There's not a skipper would think you're worth your salt. Tell me, has no other profession occurred to you that a young man of your figure and address could take up? Can't say it does. No? Then I'll tell you one. The stage! The stage? The theatrical profession! I'm in it myself, my wife is in it, my children are in it. I had a dog that lived and died in it from a puppy, and my chaise-pony goes on in "timour the tartar." I'll bring you out and your friend, too. Capital countenance for the starved business. Say the word. But I've never acted a part in my life except at school. Genteel comedy in your walk and manner, juvenile tragedy in your eye, and touch-and-go farce in your laugh! Could I live by it? Live by it? Like a prince. Why, with your salary and your friend, you'd earn a pound a week. Well, Smike, what do you... Ah. The arms of Morpheus. And with a run of good houses, nearly double the money. What do you say? Good. Crummles: here we are, my boy, the home of the drama! [Neighs] Hurry, boys. We're late. A good pony at bottom. His mother was on the stage, too. We'll find my wife rehearsing, no doubt. Astonishing woman! Mrs. Crummles was the original blood drinker. She had to give it up, though. Did it disagree with her? Not so much with her as with the audiences ah, what a woman, what a woman! Mother of 6 children, 3 of them alive, and all upon the stage. Extraordinary. Extraordinary indeed. Farewell! Alone. Alone in the African jungle and married to an outlaw! The first time I saw that admirable woman, Nickleby, she stood on her head on the butt end of a spear surrounded by blazing fireworks. Such grace... [Sniffs] Coupled with such dignity. I adored her from that moment. Mrs. Crummles: And yet another blow! My daughter lost! Wild beasts best me path! Ohh! Mrs. Crummles, my darling, allow me to introduce Mr. Nicholas Nickleby and his friend! I'm very glad to meet you, sir. Ohh! In half an hour, the sun will set, and then, then where shall I be? The end of act iv, scene 2, "the mortal struggle." A most heart-rending piece. Ah. The infant phenomenon, miss Ninetta Crummles, age 10. She's practicing for our little ballet interlude, "the Indian savage and the maiden." The idol of every place we go into. How old do you say she was? She is 10. Amazing. Mr. Folair, Mr. Nickleby. Very happy to know you, sir. How do you do, sir? Beautiful pirouette, darling. Talent there, gentlemen. Did you ever see such a setup? Do you mean the infant phenomenon? Infant, humbug, sir. She's only 10 after all. 10? She's been 10 for the last 5 years at least, but she's no taller. Up late every night and kept on a diet of gin and water unlimited from infancy. Crummles: folair! Onstage! Onstage! [Indistinct chatter] Everybody's here, Mr. Crummles. Silence, please! [Bang and scream] Silence. [Sniffs] Now, ladies and gentlemen, we'll call "the mortal struggle" for tomorrow, Saturday. On Monday morning, we shall read a new piece. The name is not known yet, but there will be good parts for everyone. Mr. Nickleby, a new performer of genius and learning, will take care of that. What? But I... On Monday morning at 10:00 everybody, please. Woman: everyone at 10:00. Mr. Crummles, I can't write a play. I'm afraid you misunderstood. And by Monday morning? My invention isn't equal to it. Invention? What's that to do with it? You said you could read French, didn't you? Yes. There. Turn that into English and put your name on the title page. What do you say, dear? We must consider the question of suitable parts. Quite, quite. I'll tell you what. You shall study Romeo when you've done that piece. Romeo? It will do very well, and you might get up rover while you're about it and Cassio and Jeremy Diddler. Ah. The apothecary for you and Polonius and Tony Lumpkin. Oh, and bottom the Weaver. Well, I doubt if... You can easily knock them off. One part helps the other so much. It's all there, cues and all. Come along, my dear. Miss Bray waiting to see you. Bray? Hmm. Daughter of the old man, I suppose, or it's his sister. Miss Bray. I hadn't expected anyone so young or so... You've come to clear the debt, I take it. No. I came to ask if you... You and Mr. Gride would give my father another chance, set him free. Set him free? My dear child, your father has been arrested. Nothing can free him now until he has paid both his debts. Surely you must know the law. I know nothing of the law. I only know that this imprisonment at his age... But you're not in the prison itself surely. You're in the rules. It's not so bad there. Bad enough, Mr. Nickleby. If you would only give us... My dear miss Bray, I've already told you I can do nothing. As for Gride, he will tell you precisely the same. Your father was once a man of wealth. Before he squandered his money, he should have thought of the consequences. [Bell dings] Now I have some work to do. Good night, sir. Good night, my dear. [Indistinct chattering] Mrs. Nickleby: An old family friend saying to me... What was his name now? It began with a "V" and ended with a "C," but whether it was Watkins or... No. It couldn't have been that. Uncle, I... Ah, my dear. As you see, were just talking about you. Kate, my love, you're to dine with your uncle at half past 6:00 tomorrow. I'm having a small party of business friends, and your mother has promised me you shall keep house for me. I'm sure you won't mind obliging me. I shall be very glad to of course, uncle, but we don't finish work until 9:00. I've already spoken to madame Mantalini. You may leave early. Oh. Well, of all the fortunes. Come in good time in a hackney coach. I'll pay for it. Good night and, uh, god bless you. I have an idea your uncle has taken a strong fancy to you. That's quite clear. Let me see. Your black silk frock will be dressy enough with that pretty, little scarf and a plain band in your hair. Man: well, if this is a discounting dinner, hawk. All I have to say is devil take me if it wouldn't be a good plan to get discount every day. You'll have plenty of it in your time. Nickleby will tell you that. What do you say, Nickleby? Am I to be a good customer? It depends entirely, milord, on circumstances. On your lordship's circumstances. And here's our hostess wondering why the deuce someone doesn't make love to her. No. Indeed. I... I... There. She can't look me in the face and deny it. I'll hold any man £50 she can't. Done! Within two minutes. Pike, you're the timekeeper. Please don't make me the subject of your bets. [Laughter] Uncle, do ask them not. Ralph: why not, my dear, if the gentleman insists. It's done in a moment. Oh, I don't insist. If miss Nickleby makes the denial, I lose, but I'd be glad to see those bright eyes of hers, especially as they favor the table so much. So they do, and it's too bad of you. [Laughter] How goes the enemy? One minute gone. Bravo! Won't you make an effort for me, miss Nickleby? You needn't trouble yourself to inquire, my buck. She and I understand each other. Time? Minute and a half gone. Get the money ready. [Laughter] Ask my niece not to leave until I have spoken to her. Thanks. That's a girl of spirit. We'll drink her health. Miss Nickleby and those bright and beautiful eyes. All: miss Nickleby. An unexpected pleasure... Your niece, I mean. Designed to surprise you, lord Frederick. Nickleby knows well enough how to please a new client. Speaking of clients, Mr. Gride, I was honored yesterday by a visit from Bray's daughter. She merely wants to set the whole course of law in reverse, free her father without payment of his debts. What an optimistic young lady. Yes... but rather a good-looking one. You see, Nickleby, the estate is large enough, but the ready cash is not. That's the deadlock. Now, I'm wondering... You mean it's no go? I never digest my dinner and business at the same time, nor should you. Come to my office one day. You're a deuced good fellow, Nickleby. Hawk said you'd come to the rescue. The most knowing card in the pack, I always called him. Eh, hawk? Where the devil is he? Ah, how delightfully studious. And such eyelashes. Upon my soul, they're perfect. Now, why did I speak and destroy such a pretty little picture? Let me go! Oh, no. I want to talk to you. Let me go! Let me leave here, please. Just a moment. Sit down, my dear. I advise you, sir, to rejoin the party. Hmm. You wanted our young friend, didn't you? If he'd found his way in here instead of me, you would have been a little blinder and a little deafer, eh? Who brought him to you? Without me, what chance would you have to land him in that net of yours? It's a large net, and rather full. I shouldn't like anyone to be choked in the meshes. Hmm. Now, Kate. I won't stay in this house a moment longer. You must calm yourself, my dear. Yes. Yes, you should go. Of course you shall. What that man said was true. You brought me here for... For your business. My dear child, how could I know this would happen? I sent the fellow off quickly enough. You saw that for yourself. Think no more of it. I shall say nothing of this to your mother. After all, it was only an incident. 1,000. Many a thanks. Thank you, milord. Nickleby's losing by it. Take my word. He wouldn't give those terms to everyone. I wouldn't. Heh heh! That, um, niece of yours... Devilish pretty girl. She is considered so, I believe. [Bells jingling] Where does the beauty live, eh? I should like to have another peep. I'm sure, milord, no good would come of your knowing. Oh, come. You know you're going to make a fortune out of me. Let me see her again, and I'll never deal with anyone else. If you could come back later... But I had a letter, just before Kate left this morning, or didn't leave, rather. Confound you, Nigel! I told you to show Mrs. Nickleby... Oh, there you are, after all. Kate, my dear. I was sure if you had been engaged, you'd have said so in the letter. And in that case, of course, you wouldn't have written it. I couldn't quite make out why we had to come, but... Oh. I beg your pardon. [Door closes] Allow me to present my sister-in-law. You're the mother of miss Nickleby, the delightful creature we met when last we dined here? No, I can't believe it. Milady is too young for that. Mrs. Nickleby: But I assure you... Sir mulberry hawk. Lord Verisopht. A great pleasure. How do you do? Milord, sir mulberry. Really, I... Now that we've met mom, we must improve on the acquaintance. I have a private box at the opera. The opera! If you and your daughter would do me the honor... It's a new opera on Saturday, first performance. Come, now. A refusal is out of the question. I'll send my carriage for you. You are so very pressing. I scarcely know what to... Kate, do you hear? Yes, mama, but... Of course. We shall be delighted. Capital. Now we must be off. Good day, Nickleby. I will see you out. Eh? What? Oh, are we going? Good day, miss Nickleby. Good day, Mrs. Nickleby. I shall look forward to Saturday. Two more handsome, delightful gentlemen, I never saw. And titles, both of them. What a wicked girl not to tell your mother you'd met them. I declare, you must have had some reason for it. Please, mama, must we go to the opera? [Woman singing opera] [Man singing] Delightful. Quite delightful. And so different from Shakespeare. I'm always ill after Shakespeare. It's the most extraordinary thing. This is the most happy evening for me, my dear. Suppose we slip out for a little supper together? Your mother won't miss you. What do you say? Why, Kate, my dear, you've gotten quite pale. It's nothing, mama. You imagined it. I was thinking the same, Mrs. Nickleby. Your daughter needs country air. Now, I have a little place near windsor. Windsor? A few hundred acres. Why not let her come down there next weekend? Accompanied by yourself, of course. Lord Frederick will be there, too. Well, really, this is too kind. Isn't it, Kate? Just think of it. Hundreds of acres. It could do you all the good in the world, won't it, lord Frederick? She's more than... [Singing continues louder] just now, it occurred to me it reminded me of the day you caught that dreadful cold the very evening that gentleman called whose father and mother married a large bishop. Or were they married by one? I'm sure you must... [Continues indistinctly] Crummles: a glooming peace this morning with it brings; the sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence to have more talk of these sad things; some shall be pardoned and some punish-ed: For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo. [Cheering and applause] Capital, my boy, a prince of a Romeo. Take it. I was quite swept off my feet, I was, really. I'm out of stout, love. Would you be a dear? Now I have another novelty. What's that, the performing pony? Oh, no, we never come to the ponies till everything else has failed. A bespeak, my boy. A benefit night in your honor. Excuse me. This just came on the London coach. From Newman Noggs. Is it bad news? "No wish to alarm you, "but your uncle being the man he is "and his friends the men they are, "events may soon occur which would put your sister in sore need of protection." [Crummles humming] Mr. Crummles, I hope you'll forgive me. I shall have to leave the company. Leave? At the height of your success? Nonsense. I just heard from London. Oh, a superior offer. I'll double it. It's nothing of that kind. My sister needs me. Oh? Short of money, I suppose, and the mortgage threatening. Ha ha! How often I've played in that situation. My boy, after your bespeak, you'll be able to send her every Penny she needs, more than that. You're very kind, Mr. Crummles, but you don't understand. It's not really a question of money. Family affection. Advice from a brother on an affair of the heart. You must write her, my boy. I'll help you with the letter myself. You better read this. What? You can see how serious it is. Seems so ungrateful of me. If there was anything else I could do... You must go. You must go at once. There's not a moment to lose. What drama. What drama! If I could take the morning coach... Yes, yes, by all means. Attention, everyone! Attention, everyone! Smike, you'll be safe here with Mr. Crummles, won't you? I wanted to go with you. I'm afraid you can't do that. I'll send for you immediately things are more settled. We shall see him off first thing tomorrow, the entire company. Costumes from the funeral scene, ways and means, act III. Everyone much affected. [Sniffs] And the infant phenomenon to present a bouquet. Afterwards, a full rehearsal for the entire company. "Romeo and Juliet"? No, no. We have no Romeo. [Crying] If you have tears, forbear to shed them now. Save them for the departure. Mr. Crummles, at great personal sacrifice... My Romeo was notorious. I can well believe it. It'll take more than that to save the day. Off you go, my boy, and make ready. And remember, our good wishes go with you every inch of the way. Thank you, sir, for all the goodness you've shown to Smike and me. I know you'll look after him. Thank you, everyone, for all your help and your kindness. I shall never forget you. Adieu. Good-bye. We'll see you off tomorrow. Good-bye, Molly. [Woman crying] Born for the lamps, too. Crudden, call the pony for tomorrow. Yes, sir. [Sniffs] Acton court. 10 minutes, gentlemen. [Indistinct chatter] the old woman thinks we are doing it for her health. So they both come down to windsor tomorrow, eh? Yes. The old mare goes out to grass, and then the little filly shows up aces. [Men chuckling] Come, let's give her the first glass of the new Magnum. Little Kate Nickleby! [Laughter] Men: Kate Nickleby! Just a minute. The little Jade, she's a worthy imitation of her uncle Ralph. Hanged back to be the more sought after. That's going to raise the interest. Will you come outside for a moment? Upon me soul, a mysterious stranger. Name your business here or nowhere. The lady you named is my sister. My business, you'll guess. Are you coming outside? No. [Chuckles] So much for the errand boy. Man: London coach just leaving, sir. [Horn tooting] I must say, hawk, I still think you should have accepted the fellow's challenge. And I still think otherwise. He was within his rights, you know. I'm not interested one way or the other. Eh? What the devil? You going to answer for what you said? To you, no! You call yourself a gentleman? Oh, go to the deuce! Let go her head. You'd better. Let her go, I tell you. Get off! Not till you... Aah! Aah! [Grunting] [Knocking on door] All right. I'm just coming. I'm just coming. Bless my soul! Kate. I must... Nicholas: I went away on one condition: That you would care for my mother and Kate. I left them to you, and this is how you treat them. Young girls like to imagine things. Kate is no exception. Kate imagined nothing. She told me nothing of her trouble. Your loose-tongued friends made it clear enough. You broke your promise, and one day, you'll pay for it. I see... An I.O.U. Of some kind, due on some indefinite date. You can sneer if you want to. I may be young, I may have no money and no experience, but I know the difference between good and evil, and I know how people of your type come to an end. [Bells jingling] From the very first, you took advantage of my helplessness. I should have known better than to trust you a second... I've heard enough! As for your mother and your sister, from now on, you can care for them. I fully intend to. You'll never make use of my sister again for your business schemes. Of course, they will have to leave the home I've provided. They've already left it! They never want to see it again... Or you. I'll tell Mr. Nickleby. Some of those things you said... Oughtn't to have said them. But they was good to hear. It's easy enough to talk. I have to make good my words. Miss Bray is here. Who? Miss Bray? Are you in or out? You didn't tell me. Perhaps you don't want to see anybody. Well, my dear? I had to come, Mr. Nickleby. It's my father's health. For some time now, he's not been very strong, and yesterday, he had an attack. The doctor always told him to be careful of his heart. Dear me. If this imprisonment has to go on, I don't know what might happen. You don't expect me to cancel the debt, to say nothing of Gride? Oh, no. If you could see your way to... Reduce the interest, I suppose. Yes. Father can earn nothing. The little I manage to make is... Barely enough to keep us in the rules, out of the prison itself. After paying the interest to you and Mr. Gride, what chance have we to pay off the debts? How can we ever be free? Child, child, you must not distress yourself. You'd do a great deal to free your father, wouldn't you? Yes. Perhaps something can be managed. Something even more practical than a reduction in the interest. I shall come in tomorrow or the day after... That's very kind of you. Thank you. Have a word or two with your father, and then, of course, we shall have to see Mr. Gride. Man: how much? I thought two pounds a week. Ha ha ha! Is that asking for so very much? Might as well ask for the moon. Good morning, sir. Good morning. I'll wait till you finish with the young gentleman. What's this one under tuition, knowledge of French required? Dancing master. Now, sir? Just a moment, young man. Am I to understand you are seeking employment? If I can find it, sir. And you speak French? Fairly well, sir. Education... a great thing. I never had any. Come along with me. But I... Not another word. [Bells tolling] I saw it in "the times" that you were in London again. Regular as the clock, sir. What do you think of Wackford Jr. As a specimen of dotheboys hall feeding? I brought him up to show parents and guardians. He has flesh. He has firmness. Look at them tears, sir. There's oiliness. Yeah, he looks well, indeed. And are you quite recovered from that young scoundrel's attack? I've only just started, sir. I was one blessed bruise from here to there. Vinegar and brown paper from morning till night. You might have thought I was a big brown paper parcel chock full of nothing else but grounds. I should like a word with you. Wackford, run and buy yourself a tart. Pastry makes their flesh shine. Parents like it. Now, sir? I suppose you're not dolt enough to forgive or forget the violence done to you by that nephew of mine... Devil a bit. Or to lose an opportunity of repaying him. Show me one. Where is he? I know where he is. We shan't lose track of him. Tell me, who was this boy he took with him? Was he young or old? He might have been nigh 20 and was just beginning to be useful about the place. I had hopes of him even earning me a bit in the village. Perhaps he will yet. My nephew will find it harder than he thinks to get the better of me. Mother! Kate! What happened? Everything's happened. Everything is settled. Did you speak to your uncle? Yes, but never mind about that. Don't you want to hear my news? I only wish we could. I went to the agency. Lo and behold, there he was. Kate: who was? Mr. Cheeryble, the chubbiest, tubbiest, most wonderful old gentleman you've ever seen. I never have seen him. I'll show him to you. Oh. White cravat, double chin. Very portly. [Laughing] [Deep voice] Young man, you are looking for work, are you not? And you speak French, do you not? But how do you know that? Not another word, young man. Follow me. [Normal voice] And off we go... Into the city, down threadneedle street, off to the left, off to the right, and up front of his door. Open the door, and what do you think's inside? Another Mr. Cheeryble... White cravat, double chin, very portly. Twins! As you say, madam. And the first Mr. Cheeryble says to the second Mr. Cheeryble... [Deep voice] "Brother Ned, here's just the young gentleman we've been looking for." Oh! Oh! "And he even speaks French, brother Ned." Oh, but what has that got to do with... Shh. Silk importers. Do half their business with France. "Young man, we offer you the vacant stool "in our counting house at a salary of 120 pounds a year." Oh, 120? "Just to start with, of course. "And as they're looking for somewhere to live, brother Charles, why can't they have the little cottage at bow?" Cottage? A real home again. Bow... it's the sweetest little village. Oh! What is it, Smike? Are you sure they'll want me? Of course they will. This is your home now. I'm sure I heard a hackney. Here we are, mother. This is Smike, just back from Portsmouth. Any friend of Nicholas is more than welcome. And this is my sister, Kate. I've heard so much about you. We are only just settling in, so I hope you'll forgive us if there's not much in the house, I mean. [Nicholas chuckles] Mrs. Nickleby: Well, now, Nicholas, much as you'd like me to stand here talking, I have so much to do. Then we mustn't keep you, mother. So like your dear papa. Never able to keep his thoughts on one subject for two minutes together. Now, what was I saying? Oh, yes. Flowers for miss la Verzey's room. You know, a fine Saturday morning like this always puts me in mind of... [Men talking indistinctly] I'll wager no one dragged you so far out of the city this last 10 years. Here we are. They must have been profiteers. Mrs. Nickleby. It is, yes. Good morning. I am Frank Cheeryble, and this is mister... Cheeryble? Not one of the brothers, surely? A nephew, ma'am, but also in the firm. And this is Mr. Linkinwater, our confidential clerk. How nice. Kate's my daughter. Mr. Cheeryble, Mr. Linkin. Oh, I've got it wrong. Well, now do come inside. We were strolling by this way, and we thought we'd call to see if you were settling in comfortably. Of course, in Devonshire, the earwigs always used to fall in around tea on Sunday evenings. What in the world? Pardon me. Oh! Let me help you. There. Oh. Very kind of you. I want to get to the kitchen. Oh, but I haven't introduced them. Heh heh heh! Isn't there some work you can put me to? Please come in and sit down. No, no, miss Nickleby, I insist on helping. Now... what can I do? Well, if you could put the books away. Oh! That doesn't sound very arduous. I'm a very good furniture mover, you know. And as for hanging pictures, well... Oh, no. I must dust them first. Oh, forgive my ignorance. In my bookshelves, they only get dusted if they're taken out. So the dry and dusty authors get dustier, still, I suppose. Naturally. It's a very good system. You can tell at a glance what's worth reading and what isn't. Oh, miss la Creevy did that. It can't be you, surely. It is. I should never have guessed it were it not for the brooch. She is no flatterer, this miss la... uh... Nicholas: Creevy. Better not let her hear you. Kate, Nicholas, Mr. Lavenderwater's found out how to light the boiler. Isn't it the cleverest thing? Well, Mr. Cheeryble, that's Kate's miniature you have there. Isn't it a most delightful likeness? This is miss la Creevy. Oh, I... I was just admiring your work. Nicholas: especially the brooch. Quite the sweetest portrait I've ever done. Now, come, everyone. It's homemade cordial. At least, I think it is. Well, did you collect the money? I couldn't. His lordship wasn't in. At this hour? Wasn't hawk there? Gone abroad. Or going. Abroad? Hawk? Had to run for it after the duel. What are you babbling about, man? What duel? What story is this that you've been fobbed off with? No story. They had an argument, him and lord Verisopht, about hawk's accident. Accident. Attempted murder. Go on. Go on! His lordship said hawk was to blame. Well, they'd been drinking. Tempers ran high. So they fought it out. Pistols. His lordship lost. You mean to tell me that he's... Dead as a doornail. That's why he wasn't in. Dead. Your nephew has lost an enemy, and you have lost 6,000 pounds. That's enough! [Bells jingling] Buried him at twickenham. Get out! [Knock knock] Are you at home? No! News, Mr. Nickleby. Wackford's done it, he has. I seen him, didn't I, father? You did, my boy, and you shall have the best button-over jacket the new boys bring down as a reward. And another thing... I found the very man for you. You might remember Mr. Snawley. He's done it! His capital b's and d's are exactly like mine. And not a figure scratched out. There ain't such a young man in all London. Well said, Tim. I'm certain our young friend will succeed in no time. Didn't I say so, brother Charles? Brother Ned, you did. Come into our room, Mr. Nickleby. Just look at those b's and d's, Mr. Ned. I have only to look at your face, my dear fellow. They're written there as plain as on the ledger. [Chuckling] We have to go to the continent. We have to go to the continent. So, for the next month or two, frank will be in charge here. He will have much to occupy him. So we want you to take off his hands a little matter he's been attending to. It concerns a father and child. They're in financial distress, Mr. Nickleby. The mother was an old friend of ours. She's been dead now some years. We're anxious to help for her sake and the girl's. But if her father knew, he'd make her life a misery. Yes, brother Charles. Yes, brother Ned. He always resented our friendship with the mother. In fact, he seems to resent everything. So we're doing what we can without his knowledge. The child has some artistic talent, and we have become... Dealers in the fine arts. Eh, brother Ned? Yes, brother Charles. [Chuckles] [Man shouting] Excuse me, sir. I'm looking for Mr. Bray's lodging. Next landing. Thank you. Lodgings, he says. Ha! Yes. With a turnkey for the landlord. [Door opens] You're miss Bray. I never thought we'd meet again. I didn't even know your name, where to find you. It seemed too much to hope for a third time. You were so kind that day. I had no chance to thank you. Bray: who is it, Madeline? What do they want? I'm from your friends, the Cheerybles, the dealers. I shall be coming in future. Miss Bray, many times since, I... Madeline. Madeline! Yes, father. Please come in. You may remember this gentleman, father. He helped us the day we... Left home. Never mind that. What's his business here? I've called about a pair of handscreens. My employers ask you to proceed with them. And I'm to pay for the two drawings with many thanks. See the money's right, Madeline. Open it, my dear. It's quite right, father, I'm sure. Sure? How can you be sure? 5 pounds. Well, is that right? Yes. Well, get it changed. Get me a newspaper. Buy me some grapes. There'll be other things, but you can go out again later. What are you waiting for? A receipt? No, sir. There's no need for that. No need? What do you mean? Do you think you bring your paltry money here as a gift? Is that it? Father. Give him a receipt. Just because you can't appreciate the time and taste bestowed on the goods you deal in, I suppose you think you give your money away. Good day, sir. Thank you. The way my father spoke to you... He's been very ill. He's worse than usual, is all. I've forgotten it already. Thank you. Miss Bray? Miss Bray, I'm not very good at disguising my feelings. My interest isn't confined to my mission here. If there's anything I can do for you at any time, I want you to know you have only to call on me. I still don't understand it. Ralph Nickleby become a charitable institution. Now, now. What's that to you? You're getting the money Bray owes you paid in full. That's more than you ever expected. And more than Bray or his daughter expected, either, I warrant. His daughter! Of course! Good-looking as well as optimistic, eh? Does Bray suspect your intentions? He should do. Heh heh heh! I've asked his daughter's hand in marriage. Marriage? Oh, so that's the story, is it? Somebody to grace your table, eh? One who can't run away like your little niece did when the clients start their wagers. Married for business as well as pleasure, eh? Good day, Mr. Gride. [Gride chuckling] Ah, miss Bray. Or may I now presume to call you Madeline? Going out, my dear? I was, for my father. Do, then. I trust I'll have time enough to enjoy your society in more congenial surroundings. [Knock on door] Bray: come in. Well, Bray, I've come for my answer. Shh! The girl may hear you. She's gone out. Besides, if she hadn't, what would it matter? You've had time enough to give her... A hint of your wishes. A hint? Do you think I have to hint to my own daughter? I was about to add that a hint from you is doubtless the equivalent of a command. Do I take it as settled, then? I don't know. It seems a cruel thing. Cruel? It would make a good marriage. Why, hundreds do it every year. The girl might fancy a younger man, I suppose. She'd like to fall in love. Can't she see what this means to you? You are an ill man, Bray, but you're not too ill to recover. If only you had your freedom. Gaiety is your element... France, with the money to support you there in luxury. And what's the reverse side of the picture? A pauper's grave out there. She understands that well enough. Then she understands her plain duty. Nicholas, I thought you'd never be home. Oh, my dear, I'm so glad you've come. I really didn't know what to do for the best. It was only this afternoon. I wasn't in, and mama couldn't stop them. Stop who? What's happened? Smike's gone. Gone? What do you mean? Taken away. Two men came. That schoolmaster was one of them. Squeers! And a Mr. Snawley, the other one said his name was. A most unpleasant man. He said he was Smike's father. He had a birth certificate to prove it, and letters, too. He's going to hand him back to Mr. Squeers. Poor soul. He was just planting the window box there, and the look on his face, I'll never forget it... Not Mr. Snawley's face, I don't think. But perhaps now I should call him young Mr. Snawley, being the son of that... Oh, mama, what kind of a father to send him back to Squeers? You should have stopped them. But they were so violent. [Knock on door] Oh! Who's that? Kate: Mr. Noggs! I've come to warn you about the boy. He's gone already. He's gone. Halfway to Hampshire by now. I mean, Yorkshire. But there's no coach till tomorrow. The saracen's head! I've never thrashed a boy in a coach before. There's inconvenience in it, but the novelty gives it a sort of relish, too. Not feeling quite so bumpish, are you, now? I must go home. You'll be home very soon, you will, in the peaceful village of dotheboys. Ha ha ha! Your mother will be fit to jump out of her skin, Wackford, when she hears about this. I caught hold of his leg when you brought him in, didn't I? Like a good'un. You always do as your father does, and when you die, you'll go right up to heaven, with no questions asked. What a girl. What a delicious girl. I'll teach you to stop running off. [Laughing] [Laughter] You can't put a finger on me. I know the law. He's to come back with me, he is. Nicholas: I thrashed you once. If that's not enough... [Yelling] Squeers: there, there. Do get up. Come on, get up. Come, Smike. I'll help you. Ohh. You haven't heard the last of this! So, kidnapping boys, would you? Heaven bless me. He... There's laws against kidnapping! I got a witness! Wackford knows the nature of an oath! Wait till the next assizes! [Yelling] Where are you? Poor boy. It seems impossible. Why? What is it? All those years back... Poor boy. Now, come, Smike. I'm not hungry. But you must eat to build up your strength. Nicholas will be angry with you, and I shall be angry, too. You won't be angry. Yes, I shall. Now are you going to finish it for me? Come in. Come in. Supper's nearly ready. Nicholas, my dear. Oh, why you're not with them. He's not with you, I mean. He had to stay behind to see someone. A message came this afternoon. Then that explains everything, I suppose. Well, this is a pleasure. Heh heh heh! Kate's in the garden, Mr. Cheeryble. Why don't you go out there and tell her you're in here? That is, I mean, well... You see, you can, if you make up your mind to it. Only because you made me. Is there anything else you'd like? Then I'll go in. Oh. It's you. I couldn't knock at this bedroom door. Better, I hope? Yes, thank you. Good. Then you'll forgive me if I steal her away from you. Tell me, miss Nickleby, do you believe that history repeats itself? Why do you ask that? I was thinking of the last family that lived in this cottage. They were a mother, son, and daughter, too. I only hope that life here will be as kind to you and your family as it was to them. It has been kind already. It's brought us new friends... Your uncles, Mr. Linkinwater, and... You. But what happened to the other family? Do tell me. Well, the mother lived here to a ripe old age, the son made a career in the city, and the daughter met a young man and married him. She always said that this cottage brought her a lifetime of happiness. You seem to have known her quite well. She was my mother. I think that history does repeat itself sometimes. Don't you... Kate? 5 years old, eh? When the schoolmaster first took him in. And the man that brought him wasn't his father. Yes, it all fits. What does? Date, facts, everything. Answer him if you can, Mr. Ralph Nickleby. Smike? And uncle Ralph? You mean there's some connection? Do I? Perhaps I do. Well, we shall soon know. I'll have a free hand tomorrow. He hasn't asked you to the wedding, has he? Wedding? Who? Didn't you know? Your uncle! Getting married. 20 years since his wife died. Now he suddenly decides to take another. Married? Uncle Ralph? Your doing in one way, you know. You stopped him using your sister as a bait for his business. If he marries miss Bray, he's got her for good. Not miss Bray who lives in Southwark, in the rules of the prison. That's the one. But she couldn't! She can't know what he is. She knows, but old Bray's deep in debt, and even my generous employer couldn't leave his father-in-law in the king's bench. [Door opens] You. I heard of your marriage. I came to beg you to reconsider it. You don't understand. I understand everything. I know what you're doing. But I know my uncle, too. No one better. Your uncle? If what he's done to his own family isn't enough... To my mother, my sister, to me. You can't marry him. You don't know what it would mean. My father's dying in this place. I must get him out of it. I won't disguise it. I've been through great unhappiness. If you'd only wait, just a week or two. My employers are abroad. They're expected back soon. I'm sure if they knew, they'd... No. No, I've taken so much from them. Besides, if I were to disappoint father now... You haven't seen him as I have, growing weaker every day. He's better already at the thought of leaving here. I won't put it off, even for an hour. He's playing on your feelings. I'm his daughter. I'm not unhappy now. I'm happy at all I can achieve for him so easily. How can you be happy? How can you ever be? Miss Bray, Madeline, I have no right to interfere, I know that, but from the first moment I saw you, at the agency, I've held you in the deepest regard. And since then, I've come to... No. No. I beg of you. I'm not here because of that, believe me. It's not from any thought of my own feelings. I don't presume to imagine you've even spared me a thought. Why should you? I have, many times. You must go. What are you doing here? I'm here to save miss Bray if I can, from you. It's no business of yours. You'd better go while you can save your skin! If you were a younger man... Please! I'm ready to come. No, I won't let you. I must. I must! Come. Kate, speak to her. If there's anything I can say to beg you to listen to my brother... The girl, too. A whole parcel of them. I advise you to leave here, my lady. I can use force with your brother. You can use force with me. I've no doubt you'd like to. Will you go? No, I'll not go! From the moment we came to London, you thought you could do as you liked with us. Mama trusted you. We all did. We found you out now, and we're free of your charity. I'm not afraid of you. If you won't get out, I'll have you turned out, the pair of you! Where's Bray? No, let me, please! Bray! Ralph: Bray! If you don't want that daughter of yours to change her mind... [Knocking on door] Are you there? Father! Father! Father! Father! Ohh! [People murmuring] You will leave that girl here. She's free now. There's nothing you can do to touch her. [Door opens] [Door closes] Ralph: Noggs. Take down this letter. "To Mr. Squeers, the saracen's head, snow hill." Hmm. "I have decided "to finance any legal action you may care to take against my nephew." Ho ho! Ho! He isn't there? Who isn't? Mr. Squeers. He's at bow street police station. You're lying. Oh, no, I'm not. And Mr. Squeers hasn't been lying, either. Mr. Squeers has confessed to conspiracy with regard to a birth certificate and certain letters purporting to prove that a Mr. Snawley was the father. I don't know what you're talking about. Don't you? Mr. Squeers says otherwise. So does Mr. Snawley. So do the police. Hold your tongue, you treacherous, sneaking... I've held my tongue for 15 years, stood by helpless while you ruined many another as once you ruined me. You ruined yourself. You'd sell your soul if you had one for a little gin. But I wouldn't sell my own flesh and blood. And it's not only little Kate I'm thinking of. I've seen the boy, Smike, the living image of his mother, of your wife. My wife? Didn't know I knew that, did you. That you had a son? Your wife died, but the child lived, and you had to keep his birth a secret or the money would have gone to him. You put him out with a poor family, didn't you, to bring up as their own? You paid them well for it, haven't you, ever since? Well, they didn't keep the boy. It isn't true. They put him to school in Yorkshire. They put him in dotheboys hall. They cheated me. Yes. They cheated you, just as you've cheated hundreds of others. In the gutter for this. And I'll deal with you, too. Will you? Will you? I've waited all these years for a chance to settle our account, and now at last it's come. The police have been here, and I've told them everything. There'll be another charge against you now... Depriving your own son of his birthright, robbing him of a fortune. They'll transport you for that, you know. Ha ha ha! They'll confiscate every Penny you've got! Ha ha ha! You can't escape now. It doesn't matter where you go. Off to see a lawyer, is that it? See if he can help you. Or are you going to bring the boy home? Own him as your own son, give him back the money? No use, no good. Nothing can help you now... Money or lawyers! It doesn't matter where you go! You're too late! Ha ha ha! Too late! Ha ha ha! [Door opens] There's such a change in him. What did the doctor say? There's nothing we can do. Only wait. [Sobs] It's me, Smike. Don't let her know. I... I... I didn't mean to keep it. Keep what? Kate. He loves her. She loves him. Couldn't... bear... to see it. Forgive me. [Thunder] [Ringing] Noggs, voice-over: I've seen the boy, Smike. The very image of his mother, of your wife. Ha ha ha! They'll transport you for that. Ha ha ha! It doesn't matter what you do. You can't save yourself. You're too late. Too late. Transport you. Can't escape. Yes, just as you cheated others. Depriving your own son of his birthright, robbing him of a fortune. Nothing can help you now... Money or lawyers. No escape. You're too late. Too late. Too late. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! And let us try to remember always the beautiful words of the marriage service we have just heard. For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to Cherish, in death us do... I didn't have 3 bridegrooms. Not that I was ever short of suitors. I must have had a dozen at least. Let me see. There was young Lukin, Mogley, Tipslark... He was hung afterwards. Then there was cabbery, smifser, the young gentleman who went to the same dancing school. Oh. And my poor, dear husband, of course. Captioning made possible by Lions Gate Entertainment
