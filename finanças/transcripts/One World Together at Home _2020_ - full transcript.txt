AND AS THIS COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS A GLOBAL CRISIS, WE HAVE TO ALL COME TOGETHER TO FIGHT IT ON A GLOBAL SCALE. LET'S TELL OUR LEADERS THAT WE NEED THEM TO STRENGTHEN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS ALL AROUND THE WORLD SO THAT A CRISIS LIKE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

EVERYBODY STAY STRONG AND STAY INSIDE. >> TONIGHT IS A TESTAMENT TO THE POWER WITHIN ALL OF US. A CRISIS OF THIS SCALE REQUIRES ACTION ON ALL FRONTS. YES, WE MUST THINK GLOBALLY AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION'S EFFORTS TO CURB THE PANDEMIC AND PREVENT FUTURE OUTBREAKS, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO ACT LOCALLY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE CHARITIES AND INITIATIVES THAT ARE SERVICING OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND THOSE WHO ARE IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF RESOURCES TO SURVIVE, LIKE FOOD, SHELTER, AND HEALTH CARE. TONIGHT, WE'LL BE HIGHLIGHTING CHARITIES WHO ARE DOING INCREDIBLE WORK ON THE GROUND. THOSE CHARITIES BENEFIT FROM THE GENEROSITY OF OUR PRIVATE-SECTOR SUPPORTERS. YOU'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT THESE ORGANIZATIONS OVER THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT, BUT I'D LIKE TO GIVE A VERY HEARTFELT THANK YOU TO "NO KID HUNGRY," WHO HAVE CONNECTED 1.7 MILLION KIDS WITH MEALS; AND THE C.D.C.'S FOUNDATION EMERGENCY RESPONSE FUND, WHO PROVIDED MEDICAL SUPPLIES. EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE, BE SAFE. >> HI, EVERYBODY. IT'S ME, ABBY. MY MOMMY SET UP THIS REALLY NEAT LITTLE VIDEO CHAT PLACE SO I CAN VISIT WITH EVERYBODY.

SHE SAID THAT WHEN I HAVE BIG FEELINGS OR LITTLE FEELINGS OR ANYTHING IN BETWEEN, I CAN JUST GIVE MYSELF A HUG, A SELF-HUG, JUST LIKE THAT. AND IT'S REALLY NICE. I HOLD MYSELF REAL TIGHT, AND I TAKE A DEEP BREATH. AND I FEEL COMFORTED. AND, WELL, IF YOU'RE HAVING THOSE FEELINGS, TOO, YOU GIVE YOURSELF A NICE, BIG HUG. ♪ ♪ ♪ >> THIS IS OUR HOME.

OR IN MY HOMETOWN OF NEW ORLEANS, A CITY THAT'S BEING DEVASTATED BY THIS VIRUS, TIM LOCKLAND PLAYS JAZZ ON HIS BALCONY EVERY NIGHT TO HELP BRING MUSIC BACK TO THE STREETS. AND ALL OVER THE WORLD IT'S HAPPENING-- SINGING OPERAS OUT OF WINDOWS, VIRTUAL SEWING PARTIES FOR MASKS, DONATING FOOD FOR DOCTORS AND NURSES, AND THERE ARE HOMEMADE SIGNS EVERYWHERE TO GIVE US HOPE. THIS CRISIS HAS US ALL ISOLATED, BUT THE STRENGTH OF HUMAN KINDNESS MEANS WE ARE NEVER ALONE. >> ♪ AND, OH, I LOVE YOU SO. ♪ >> COVID-19 HAS LEFT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES, WITH MANY WONDERING HOW AND WHERE THEY'LL FIND THEIR NEXT MEAL.

DON'T TOUCH YOUR FACE, OKAY. >> NOW THEY NEED HER MORE THAN EVER. TELL US WHAT LIFE IS LIKE ON THE FRONT LINE. >> WE FIND OURSELVES BEING INFORMATIVE FOR THEM, AS WELL AS GIVING THEM SUPPLIES. SO, IT'S A LITTLE SCARY AND CHALLENGING AT TIMES. >> DESPITE THE RISKS, SHIRLEY SAYS SHE'LL BE THERE FOR THEM, NO MATTER WHAT. >> I KNOW THEY'VE ASKED YOU BEFORE, LIKE, "WHY-- WHY DO YOU KEEP COMING OUT HERE?" WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM. >> I SAY I LOVE THEM. I KEEP COMING OUT BECAUSE I LOVE THEM. I MADE A PROMISE TO THEM THREE YEARS AGO THAT I WAS THERE FOR THEM. Y'ALL NEED MASKS? I KNOW WE'RE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES RIGHT NOW, BUT THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO DESERT THEM. AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE OKAY. >> FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS, MANY OF US HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO SHELTER AT HOME. IMAGINE IF YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THAT OPTION. THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY IS ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS WHEN IT COMES TO FACING COVID-19. RINATA ALEXIS IS THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF THE YOUTH SHELTER OF COVENANT HOUSE IN NEW YORK CITY. HI, RINATA. >> HI, AMY. SO, COVENANT HOUSE SERVES HOMELESS, RUNAWAY, AND TRAFFICKED YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS 31 CITIES AND SIX COUNTRIES. THE HOMELESS, INCLUDING OUR HOMELESS YOUNG PEOPLE, ARE IN DANGER RIGHT NOW WITH LITTLE OR NO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND TESTING, AND THEY'RE ALREADY ENDURING CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT MAKE THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE. HOMELESS YOUNG PEOPLE CANNOT SELF-ISOLATE. THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO CALL HOME. I THINK IT'S REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR WORLD LEADERS TO KNOW THAT WE WANT TO PUT AN END TO THIS VIRUS. EVERYONE NEEDS A WAY TO SURVIVE IT, INCLUDING OUR HOMELESS YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST TOO OFTEN FORGOTTEN. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME AND TO US, AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL THE CARE THAT YOU GIVE TO PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT.

BLACK AMERICANS DISPROPORTIONATELY BELONG TO THESE ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THE WORKFORCE THAT DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF WORKING FROM HOME.

WITH A POPULATION OF OVER A BILLION CITIZENS, THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 IS BOUND TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COUNTRY, LIKE IT IS IMPACTING THE REST OF THE WORLD, TOO. BATTLING THIS CRISIS IS GOING TO TAKE ITS TOLL, AND THIS IS THE TIME TO TAKE ACTION. RIGHT NOW, I'M WORKING WITH A TEAM OF PEOPLE TO PROVIDE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, FOOD AND ESSENTIALS TO PATIENTS, HOSPITALS, AND HOMES. BUT TO BEAT THIS WORLD PANDEMIC, THE WORLD HAS TO, MUST COME TOGETHER. SO, FIND OUT HOW YOU CAN CONTACT WORLD AND PRIVATE-SECTOR LEADERS AND ASK THEM TO CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE W.H.O.'S SOLIDARITY RESPONSE FUND SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO HELP THE HARDEST HIT AREAS AND PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT. INDIA, PLANET EARTH, TONIGHT, WE ARE ONE WORLD. I LOVE YOU. STAY STRONG. >> Kimmel: HI, IT'S ONE OF THE JIMMIES, AGAIN. I FORGET WHICH ONE, TOO. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT NOW TO THANK APPLE, BECAUSE APPLE-- THE COMPANY, NOT THE FRUIT-- DONATED A VERY GENEROUS AMOUNT TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO PERSONALLY THANK APPLE FOR BABY-SITTING MY CHILDREN OVER THE MONTH, FOR REAL. THANKS, APPLE. AND HERE NOW WITH MORE FROM THE COVID-19 FIGHT ABROAD, NORAH O'DONNELL. >> THESE ARE THE FACES OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS IN THE FRONT LINES IN SOUTH KOREA. BANDAGES COVERING WOUNDS LEFT BY THEIR PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT-- BADGES OF SELF-SACRIFICE AS THEY RISK THEMSELVES TO SAVE OTHERS. AMONG THEM IS DR. YON J. KIM. >> DR. KIM HAS SPENT MONTHS WORKING WITH PATIENTS FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES. SO HAS DR. JEFFREY TOI. >> NURSE KONG SAYS SHE'S TRYING TO HIDE HER ANXIETY FROM HER PATIENTS. >> SOUTH KOREA APPEARS TO HAVE TURNED THE CORNER WITH A STRATEGY OF TEST, TRACE AND TREAT, A LESSON LEARNED AFTER THE 2015 OUTBREAK OF MERS, ANOTHER RESPIRATORY DISEASE. >> THERE ARE GLIMPSES OF LIFE BEFORE THE VIRUS. SOUTH KOREANS VOTED THIS WEEK. BASEBALL IS COMING BACK, AND SO ARE EMPLOYMENT EXAMS-- THOUGH EVERYTHING LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT, AT LEAST FOR NOW. >> WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT COVID-19 EVERY DAY. THE BRIGHTEST AND MOST BRILLIANT SCIENTISTS AND DOCTORS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND THIS DISEASE AND BEAT IT. BUT UNTIL WE HAVE A CURE, WE CAN ONLY RESPOND TO WHAT WE KNOW. IN FACT, A RECENT STUDY DONE BY THE C.D.C. SHOWS THAT 33% OF THE PEOPLE HOSPITALIZED IN THE UNITED STATES ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN, EVEN THOUGH WE ONLY MAKE UP 13% OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC. SO, THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO PAY ATTENTION TO. PRE-EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS, AND LACK OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIETAL CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SOME OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S MOST PREVALENT AMONG COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. PRACTICE THE GUIDELINES FOR PREVENTION SO THAT WE CAN BEAT THIS THING, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BEAT THIS THING. I WANT TO GIVE A PERSONAL THANK YOU TO UNITED WAY FOR YOUR WORK ASSISTING PEOPLE OF COLOR MOST IMPACTED BY THIS HEALTH AND FINANCIAL CRISIS, AND L.I.S.C. FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF LOCAL BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY OWNED BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. KEEP YOUR FREQUENCY HIGH, AND I'M SENDING YOU ALL MY LOVE. >> Fallon: THE UNITED NATIONS URGES US TO THINK GLOBAL AND ACT LOCALLY TO PREVENT A FUTURE OUTBREAKS. HERE TO TELL US MORE IS SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE U.N., ANTONIO GUTERRES. >> WE FACE A CRISIS UNLIKE ANY OTHER. TO OVERCOME IT, WE MUST UNITE.

AND PLEASE JOIN OUR CALL FOR A GLOBAL CEASE-FIRE TO FOCUS ON OUR COMMON ENEMY, THE VIRUS.

I REMAIN, UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, STEPHEN COLBERT. RIGHT NOW, ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS ABOUT OUR CURRENT ORDEAL IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL LAST. AT TIMES LIKE THIS, I TURN TO ONE OF THE SMARTEST GUYS I KNOW. OH, WHAT'S HIS NAME? OH, COME ON. UH... MELINDA GATES' HUSBAND. BILBO! NOPE. BILL, BILL. SO, TELL US, BILL, MELINDA, HOW MUCH LONGER WILL WE BE DEALING WITH ALL THIS? >> WELL, STEPHEN, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HURTING, AND ALL OF US WANT THIS TO BE OVER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT BY MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS NOW, WE CAN SAVE LIVES. WE CAN GET OUR COUNTRY BACK TO WORK, AND, EVENTUALLY, WE CAN GET KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL, TOO. >> THE EVENTUAL END COMES WHEN WE GET A VACCINE THAT PROTECTS ALL OF US, NOT JUST IN THE U.S., IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. THERE'S A LOT OF VACCINE CANDIDATES THAT WE'RE BACKING, AND I'M OPTIMISTIC BY LATE NEXT YEAR, ONE OF THOSE WILL COME OUT. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT GETS OUT TO EVERYONE IN THE WORLD. >> THAT'S RIGHT. OUR RESPONSE TO THIS PANDEMIC WON'T BE EFFECTIVE UNLESS IT'S EQUITABLE. AND BEFORE WE GO, WE JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO A FEW PEOPLE, STARTING WITH THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE RISING TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE IN SUCH INCREDIBLE AND HEROIC WAYS. WE SEE IT AND HEAR ABOUT IT EVERY DAY. WE ALSO WANT TO THANK THE SCIENTISTS AND THE RESEARCHERS WHO ARE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK. THE PEOPLE PROVIDING ESSENTIAL SERVICES, LIKE MAIL AND GROCERIES, SO SOCIETY CAN KEEP GOING. AND EVERYBODY WHO'S DOING THEIR PART AND STAYING HOME. YOUR ACTIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY SAVING LIVES, AND YOU'RE A BIG PART OF THE REASON WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS. >> EVERYONE APPRECIATES THE FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AS TRUE HEROES IN THE CORONAVIRUS FIGHT, BUT YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE MASSIVE MOBILIZATION OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THAT'S TAKING PLACE. THE VERY BEST IN SCIENCE ARE WORKING WITH URGENCY AND UNITY TO DELIVER SOLUTIONS TO END THIS CARNAGE. TEAMS OF CHEMISTS ARE SYNTHESIZING COMPOUNDS WITH TEAMS OF BIOLOGISTS TO TEST IN SEARCH OF AN EFFECTIVE DRUG. LIKEWISE, TEAMS OF SCIENTISTS ARE WORKING TO ISOLATE ANTIBODIES TO NEUTRALIZE THE VIRUS AND TO DEVELOP PROTECTIVE VACCINES. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SCIENCE WILL COME THROUGH. OUR WORK WILL TAKE TIME. PLEASE BUY US THAT TIME. THE WORLD MUST ACT AS ONE NOW. LET'S STAY AT HOME TOGETHER, FLATTEN THE CURVE TOGETHER, AND GIVE SCIENTISTS THE TIME NEEDED TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO END THIS PANDEMIC. BE SAFE AND BE WELL. >> Fallon: DR. SANELE MADELA RUNS A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER IN SOUTH AFRICA. HERE TO TELL US ABOUT THE CHALLENGES HE AND HIS FELLOW FRONTLINE WORKERS ARE FACING IS DR. MADELA. DR. MADELA, IT'S SO NICE TO TALK TO YOU. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JIM, FOR INVITING ME. >> Fallon: YOU AND YOUR FELLOW FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS ALREADY HAVE A TOUGH JOB. NOW THIS PANDEMIC ON TOP OF THAT. HOW ARE YOU PREPARING AND WHAT ARE YOUR MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES? >> I'M A COMMUNITY DOCTOR IN THE PROVINCE HERE OF KWAZULU-NATAL IN SOUTH AFRICA. AND, UNFORTUNATELY, IN THE COMMUNITY THAT I SERVE, WE ALREADY HAVE ABOUT 25% OF THE ADULTS THAT ARE LIVING WITH H.I.V. WHICH NOW, COVID-19, AS AN ADDITION, IS REALLY SCARY FOR ALL OF US. AND THEY WILL NEED, GOING FORWARD, A HUGE ASSISTANCE AND HELP FROM THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY SUPPORT THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE IN THE FRONT LINE, AND THEY SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR FACILITIES. SO, WE WOULD LIKE THE PUBLIC AND THE-- THE PEOPLE AT LARGE OF THE WORLD TO SUPPORT THE CALLS THAT ARE MADE BY HEALTH EXPERTS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT LEADERS, TO STAY AT HOME, BECAUSE TOGETHER WE CAN FLATTEN THE CURVE. >> Fallon: DR.

AND COMMUNITIES STILL RANSACKED BY H.I.V. AND AIDS. BUT THEY KEEP GOING. AND IN EVERY COUNTRY, IN EVERY CONTINENT, WE HAVE SEEN SUCH PHENOMENAL ACTS OF COURAGE FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS FIGHT AGAINST CORONAVIRUS. I TELL YOU, WE ALL APPRECIATED HEALTH CARE WORKERS, BUT NEVER LIKE NOW. THEY HAVE DONE THIS OFTEN AT CONSIDERABLE RISK TO THEMSELVES BECAUSE WHEN THERE ARE LIVES AT STAKE, THEIR FIRST THOUGHTS ARE NOT ABOUT THEMSELVES BUT FOR OTHERS. THEY TRULY ARE THE BEST OF US, AND THEIR COMPASSION AND THEIR TRUE ACTS OF SERVICE IS A CALL TO ACTION FOR ALL OF US. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD STEP UP NOW AND PROVIDE THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS WITH THE EQUIPMENT, WITH THE FUNDS, WITH THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. AND TONIGHT, WE STAND AS ONE WORLD UNITED IN OUR FIGHT TO RID THE WORLD OF THIS DISEASE, AND TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING LIKE THIS EVER HAPPENS AGAIN. AND WHEN AND IF IT DOES, WE WILL BE READY. >> THANK YOU, GLOBAL CITIZEN, FOR HAVING ME BE PART OF SUCH A-- A BEAUTIFUL THING.

TOO MANY TIMES OVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS, THOSE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ARE THE FINAL FRIENDLY FACE SEEN BY A PATIENT BEFORE THEY SUCCUMB TO THIS VIRUS. NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE A LOVED ONE IS ONE OF THE MOST HEARTBREAKING PARTS OF THE ISOLATION THAT COMES WITH DEFEATING COVID-19.

( LAUGHS ) >> TODAY, THERE IS NO QUESTION THE IMPACT COVID-19 HAS HAD ACROSS THE GLOBE. IT'S BEEN UNIMAGINABLE FOR ALL OF US. BUT FOR THE 70 MILLION PEOPLE DISPLACED IN CAMPS AND SHELTERS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING FACILITIES HERE IN THE U.S., THAT IMPACT IS PARTICULARLY DEVASTATING. I HAVE WITNESSED FIRSTHAND SOME OF THE OVERCROWDED AND UNLIVABLE CONDITIONS IN REFUGEE CAMPS. SOCIAL DISTANCING THERE IS SIMPLY NOT AN OPTION. IN ORDER TO CURB THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 IN THESE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES, THEY NEED THEIR BASICS: HEALTH CARE, CLEAN WATER, SANITATION.

AND, ALSO, NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES YOU'RE FACING, THESE ARE CHALLENGING TIMES. EVEN IF YOU'RE STAYING HOME WITH FAMILY OR BY YOURSELF, WE'RE ALL STRUGGLING WITH DIFFERENT EMOTIONS. PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING IS CRITICAL, BUT WE ALSO NEED TO CONSIDER HOW ISOLATION MAY AFFECT OUR MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. SO, WHETHER YOU'RE AT HOME OR ON THE FRONT LINE, IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT HOW THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME IS GOING TO IMPACT YOUR MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING, YOU ARE NOT ALONE. DR. SUE VARMA, A PSYCHIATRIST AT THE N.Y.U. LANGONE MEDICAL CENTER, IS WITH US TO SHARE HER THOUGHTS ON WAYS WE CAN MANAGE THE MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL TOLL OF THIS CRISIS. >> MANY PEOPLE ARE FEELING FEAR, ANXIETY, AND GRIEF DURING THIS CRISIS. THIS IS TOTALLY NORMAL. IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW IS HAVING A PERSISTENTLY LOW MOOD OR ANXIETY, AS WELL AS HAVING CHANGES IN SLEEP, APPETITE, CONCENTRATION, OR IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE EXPERIENCING JOY OR MOTIVATION, PLEASE TALK TO YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNSELOR VIA TELEHEALTH OR LOCAL COUNSELOR IN YOUR COMMUNITY. IF YOU HAVE HAD A PRIOR HISTORY OF ANXIETY, MOOD, SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS OR TRAUMA, OR ARE A FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKER, YOU, TOO, COULD BE MORE VULNERABLE AT THIS TIME. EVERYONE NEEDS TO MAKE TIME FOR THE "Ms" OF MENTAL HEALTH: MOVEMENT, MINDFULNESS, MASTERY-- WHICH IS SOMETHING FUN AND CREATIVE-- AND MEANINGFUL CONNECTION. LABEL YOUR EMOTIONS AND TALK TO A TRUSTED PERSON ABOUT THEM. AND DON'T FORGET TO LAUGH, EXPRESS GRATITUDE, AND OFFER SOMEONE HELP. SMALL ACTS OF KINDNESS ARE MORE BOOSTING FOR BOTH THE GIVER AND RECEIVER. WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER, AND WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. REMEMBER, YOU ARE NOT ALONE. >> Fallon: THE BATTLE AGAINST COVID-19 IS A GLOBAL FIGHT WITH OUR BRAVE HEALTH CARE WORKERS SERVING ON THE FRONT LINES. TONIGHT, WE THANK BLOOMBERG PHILANTHROPIES AND, OF COURSE, MIKE BLOOMBERG FOR ALL THEIR RELIEF WORK, FROM HELPING COUNTRIES IN AFRICA TO PREPARE THEIR HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS TO PROVIDING MEALS TO PUBLIC WORKERS IN HOSPITALS. AND NOW, HERE'S A COUPLE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE FIGHT AGAINST CORONAVIRUS ALL TOO WELL, IDRIS AND SABRINA ELBA. >> WHAT'S UP, GLOBAL CITIZENS? IT'S IDRIS AND SABRINA. LISTEN, THERE'S A STORY I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, A WOMAN CALLED ITALICA GRONDONA, AND, IN 1918, SHE SURVIVED THE SPANISH FLU. LAST MONTH, IN 2020, AT 102 YEARS OLD, SHE SURVIVED COVID. >> ITALY WAS RAVAGED BY THE VIRUS, BUT, NOW, FINALLY, NUMBERS OF NEW CASES ARE DROPPING. AND WHILE WE'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS, IT'S THE HOPE THAT FUELS US ALL. THAT WE ALL DESERVE QUALITY HEALTH CARE. >> WE ARE SO PROUD TO BE HERE UNITED WITH THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, WHO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL P.P.E. SUPPLIES TO HEALTH CARE WORKERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD, TO HELP PATIENTS LIKE ITALICA. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO, LISTEN, I'M GOING TO SING A SONG NOW, AND... >> NO, I'M SORRY.

JUST RELAX. >> ♪ YOU HOLD TIGHT TO YOUR UMBRELLA ♪ DARLING, I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU ♪ THAT THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A RAINBOW HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD. ♪ ( SIRENS, APPLAUSE ) >> WHEN THE CORONAVIRUS SPREAD THROUGH A NURSING HOME IN WASHINGTON STATE, CLOSING SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES BECAME PART OF AN EFFORT TO SAVE SENIORS. >> WE'RE ASKING OUR OLDER GENERATION TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES, AND WE'RE ASKING THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS TO SUPPORT THEM IN SOCIAL CONTACTING. >> SOCIAL MEDIA HELPED REMEDY SOCIAL DISTANCING. ACTS OF KINDNESS TOOK ROOT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. NEIGHBORS DELIVERING FOOD AND FLOWERS, AND OFFERING FRONT-PORCH PERFORMANCES. SENIORS AT MORE THAN 70 GROCERY STORES IN LOUISIANA AND GEORGIA HAD THEIR BILLS PAID ONE WEDNESDAY MORNING BY MEDIA MOGUL TYLER PERRY. >> TYLER PERRY PAID FOR YOUR GROCERY BILL TODAY. >> ARE YOU KIDDING ME? >> HOW IMPORTANT IS IT, TYLER, TO STEP UP FOR THE SENIOR COMMUNITIES AT THIS TIME? >> THEY'RE SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US. I COME FROM A BACKGROUND OF WHERE WE REALLY, REALLY RESPECTED THE ONES WHO PAVED THE WAY. >> OF COURSE, MANY OF AMERICA'S SENIORS CONTINUE PAVING THE WAY. >> WHEN THE CALL CAME OUT FOR RETIRED PHYSICIANS TO COME TO WORK, I REALLY DIDN'T HESITATE. >> CONSIDERED HIGH-RISK AT 68 YEARS OLD, NEW YORK'S DR. JUDY SALERNO IS BACK ON THE FRONT LINES OF PATIENT CARE. WAS THERE A MOMENT THAT YOU SAID, "I'VE GOT TO DO." >> JUST THE ANXIETY THAT WAS BUILDING IN ME AS I SAW THE PANDEMIC GROW, I JUST KNEW WHERE I HAD TO BE. >> FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS, WE ALL WATCHED AS THE COVID-19 TRAVERSED ACROSS THE GLOBE. WE WONDERED IF, AND FINALLY WHEN, IS THIS VIRUS GOING TO HIT OUR DOORSTEPS? AND IT DID. IT HIT THE HEARTLAND SLOWLY, BUT AS THE CASES GOT CONFIRMED, IT BECAME AN INEVITABLE TRUTH THAT, YES, IT IS HERE ON OUR DOORSTEPS. AND WHETHER YOU'RE FROM NEW YORK CITY OR AUSTIN, TEXAS, OR TIMBUKTU, THIS IS A VIRUS THAT KNOWS NO LINES OR RESPECTS NO BOUNDARIES, AND THAT NONE OF US ARE IMMUNE TO. SO, WHAT CAN WE DO? WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS ON THE FRONTLINE, GOT TO BUY THEM TIME BY TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF OUR ELDERS, THE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE OF ALL OF US. WE'VE GOT TO KEEP THEIR SPIRITS HIGH, KEEP THEM QUARANTINED AND SAFE UNTIL THIS IS OVER. IF WE TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES, WE TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. >> Colbert: STEPHEN COLBERT HERE AGAIN, AND THIS IS MY DAD, DR. JAMES W. COLBERT. DAD WAS AN IMMUNOLOGIST, AND, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, HE WAS THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE, WHICH DR. ANTHONY FAUCI NOW HEADS. AND LATELY, I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT MY DAD AND WISHING I COULD TALK TO HIM ABOUT WHAT IN THE FACE OF THIS PANDEMIC IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND I HAVE NO DOUBT HE WOULD SAY FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF SCIENTISTS, BUT ALSO THAT SCIENCE CAN ANSWER ONLY HOW THE WORLD WORKS, NOT WHY WE ARE IN THIS WORLD. FOR THAT, WE HAVE TO FOLLOW OUR HEARTS. AND THIS CRISIS HAS REMINDED US WITH URGENCY THAT WE ARE HERE TO BE AS KIND AS WE CAN, BECAUSE WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER-- AND IT WILL BE OVER-- WHAT WE WILL REMEMBER IS HOW WE TREATED ONE ANOTHER. AND I PRAY THAT WHEN WE LOOK BACK ON THIS TIME OF TRIAL, WE CAN SAY THAT WE FACED IT WITH DETERMINATION, HOPE, AND LOVE. BUT FOR NOW, STAY STRONG, BE BRAVE, AND ENJOY BILLIE EILISH AND FINNEAS. >> HEY, YOU GUYS. SO, I CHOSE TO SING "SUNNY" BY BOBBY HEBB. I LOVE THIS SONG. IT'S ALWAYS WARMED MY HEART AND MADE ME FEEL GOOD, AND I WANTED TO MAKE YOU GUYS FEEL GOOD.

THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. >> Kimmel: THANK YOU, BILLIE AND FINNEAS. I'M GLAD YOUR MOM BOUGHT YOU THAT ORGAN. WE HAVE MORE THANKS TO GIVE. GLOBAL CITIZEN WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS THEIR APPRECIATION TO THE STATLER FAMILY FOUNDATION, WHICH IS SUPPORTING THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION'S EFFORTS TO BUILDRESILIENT HEALTH SYSTEMS AND ENSURE THAT FRONT LINE HEALTH WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL P.P.E.s. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HELP--I MEAN, REALLY GET IN THERE AND >> NEVER DID I EVER THINK THAT I WAS GOING TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES FIGHTING A WAR. I SHAVED MY HEAD AS A RALLY CRY, AS A PERSONAL REMINDER THAT THIS IS LIFE AND DEATH. >> NEW YORK DOCTOR ED LATHEEM, DEEP IN THE TRENCHES OF THE PANDEMIC. >> WE'VE GOT MULTIPLE RESUSCITATIONS AND INTUBATIONS. WE DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN, TO EAT, TO DRINK, BARELY TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. >> THIS VIRUS HAS AFFECTED EVERYBODY. IT'S WHY I'M SLEEPING IN THE GARAGE, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BRING THE ENEMY HOME WITH ME. >> LIKE SO MANY OTHERS SEPARATED FROM THOSE HE LOVES DURING THE BATTLE. DR. PAUL SONDERS RISKED HIS LIFE FOR HIS PATIENTS. A SURVIVOR OF THE DEADLY VIRUS, HE'S RETURNING TO THE MEDICAL BATTLEFIELD, ONLY TO BE SURPRISED BY THIS: >> WELCOME BACK. >> HAPPY TO BE BACK! ( APPLAUSE ) >> EVERYONE'S WORKING SO HARD, AND, THE WHOLE TIME I WAS HOME, I'M JUST ANXIOUS TO GET BACK. >> THAT BRAVERY DOESN'T GO UNNOTICED. IN NEW YORK CITY, EVERY NIGHT AT 7:00 P.M., FROM THE WINDOWS TO THE SIDEWALKS, BURSTS OF CHEERS FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY ARE SOLDIERS IN A WAR WITH A MESSAGE, HEROES CELEBRATED BY A GRATEFUL AMERICA, FINDING STRENGTH IN A SHARED MOMENT OF HOPE. >> THANK YOU! >> IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME, BUT WE'RE RISING TO THE CHALLENGE. AND WE'RE GOING TO STAY IN THIS UNTIL WE CAN DEFEAT IT. >> THANK YOU, GLOBAL CITIZENS, FOR YOUR SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT FOR THE LIFE-SAVING WORK OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND THE WHOLE UNITED NATIONS FAMILY. WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER, AND EVERYONE HAS GOT A ROLE TO PLAY. WHEN WE'RE AT HOME, WE'RE HELPING OUR BRAVE HEALTH WORKERS. WE MUST LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND, AND WE MUST ACCELERATE IN OUR RACE TO FIND A VACCINE. AFTER ALL, COVID-19 ANYWHERE IS A THREAT TO PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. LET'S KEEP FIGHTING TOGETHER TO STOP THE PANDEMIC AND SUPPORT THE MOST VULNERABLE AND BUILD BACK BETTER IN SOLIDARITY. >> PARENTS AROUND THE WORLD ARE STRUGGLING WITH SCHOOL CLOSURES. SCHOOLS ARE CLOSING EVERYWHERE. FOR MANY, IT'S LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO TEACH THEIR KIDS AT HOME, WHICH IS TOUGH ALREADY. BUT FOR OTHERS, THE PROBLEM IS MUCH MORE DIRE. AND NOW, WITH THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 ACROSS THE WORLD, IT'S ESTIMATED THAT 91% OF THE WORLD'S CHILDREN ARE OUT OF SCHOOL ALL TOGETHER. THE MOST MARGINALIZED KIDS IN MOST POVERTY-STRICKEN AREAS, THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO SUFFER THE MOST. WITHOUT SUPPORT, THEY'RE IN GREAT DANGER OF FALLING BEHIND, AND EVEN FALLING OUT OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM ALL TOGETHER. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. SO, JOIN THE GLOBAL EFFORT TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS SO THAT KIDS CAN GO BACK TO SCHOOL. I'M SENDING MY LOVE TO MY COMMUNITY BACK HOME IN VIRGINIA BEACH. I LOVE YOU, AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. >> Fallon: SHE'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST STARS ON THE PLANET AND HAS ALREADY CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH TO THE W.H.O. TO HELP THOSE AFFECTED BY CORONAVIRUS.

THERE'S 54 COUNTRIES, OVER 3,000 ETHNIC GROUPS, MORE THAN 2,000 LANGUAGES. THAT'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE TO NAVIGATE. AND YET, ALL ACROSS THE CONTINENT, WE ARE UNITED BY THE RESILIENCE OF OUR SPIRITS AND THE RESOURCEFULNESS OF OUR MINDS THAT HAVE HELPED US THROUGH THE MANY CHALLENGES. TODAY, AS THE WHOLE WORLD COMES TO TERMS WITH COVID-19 AND CASES IN AFRICA ARE ON THE RISE, WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THOUGH WE KEEP EACH OTHER SAFE BY PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO EMOTIONALLY DISTANCE OURSELVES. KEEPING EVERYONE SAFE AND HEALTHY REQUIRES STRONG LOCAL AND GLOBAL TIES. WE MUST REMAIN VIGILANT AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL COMMUNITIES IN AFRICA AND AROUND THE WORLD HAVE ACCESS TO LIFE-SAVING TESTING, PROTECTIVE SUPPLIES, AND TREATMENT. LET'S CONTINUE THE FIGHT TOGETHER UNTIL COVID-19 IS GONE. >> OSCAR THE GROUCH HERE TO TELL YOU TO STAY HOME. I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR SMILING FACE. I DON'T WANT TO SMELL YOUR PRETTY PERFUME.
