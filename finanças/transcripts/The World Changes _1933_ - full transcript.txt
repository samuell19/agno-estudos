Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Orin! Orin! Orin! Whoa! - Take me out, Orin. - No, Anna. Lay back. Take me out. Anna! Repeat after me. Praise God. Here may we live and prosper. Here may we live and prosper. And let our baby be strong. Put your arm around me, Orin. - Anna. - No, hold me, Orin, hold me. Orin! Orin... Orin! Orin! Oh, you! Yes, yes! Yes. Well! Some day you're gonna be chopping wood for your Ma, Orin, huh? You! Orin! Look! # And I'm going to California-yey # # The gold dust for to see # # Oh, California-yey # # That's the land for me # # Oh, I'm going to Sacramento # # With my washbowl on my knee # # Oh, California # Oh, Pop! Look! Why, it's a man! And look, there's a house there. Otto Peterson! Put that gun down! - But he may be an outlaw, Mama! - Put it down, I say! Welcome, friend. Welcome, ma'am. Maybe you can tell us where we're at. Sure. Dakota. Indian territory. Where are you heading? We're going to California-yey. - Keep still, Otto! - We're heading anyplace. Anyplace a man can live off the land and raise his family in peace. Friend, you're home. Come. Come. They'll be coming out. Yessir, they'll be coming out by the hundreds. - You wait and see. - Yeah, maybe you're right. - Her name is Selma. - Well! His is Orin, after his father. Tell me, Mrs. Nordholm, are you happy here? Well, this is where my son was born. We broke that ground and plowed it. It's ours. The house is ours. We built it. Everything in it we made with our own hands. I'm happy. We belong here. We'll never leave it. Never. I've just been telling Peterson, Anna. They'll be coming out here by the hundreds soon. You wait and see. There'll be a town here in two years, where we stopped our wagon. A town... One, two, three, four... Seven people. We have a town. What we need is a name. - Okay, now let's see. - Well, there is only one name. - Orinville. - Well, now! Orinville. - Orinville, Colonel. - Never heard of it. But that ain't gonna stop us from feeding. - Forward! - Giddyup! Give me a chord! Neighbors, friends. This is one of the most important occasions... ...in the history of our fair town, Orinville. I want to propose a toast... ...to the health of the stalwart groom, Otto Peterson, and to the blushing bride, Amy Gray. One by one, our children are growing up, ...and getting their own wives, husbands, and farms. I only pray the Lord to keep me going... to the day when I can stand up to the wedding... ...of my own Orin and little Selma Peterson. In the name of the Lord, and thanks to Him for his almighty goodness, I pray him to bless this farm... and those... I'm mighty sorry to disturb you folks. I'm Lt. Col. Custer, of the United States Army. I've got news for you, which I know you don't know yet... ...and you'll be powerful glad to hear. Folks, the war is over! I said the war is over, folks. What war? What wa... Lady, don't you know there's a war been going on? No. You don't know there's been a war on for four years between the North and the South? No! We have nothing to do with that. We have our own troubles. Wait a minute, Lady. Did you ever hear of General Grant? No. Abraham Lincoln? No. Lady, did you ever hear tell of the United States of America? Mister, we've been fighting a war for the United States of America... ...for the last ten years. And it's not over yet. Not by a long sight. Who sent you here? Why... the government wants to get after some of the tribes up back in the hills. - My company's been sent out... - That's fine, but you all better have something to eat first. Yes, ma'am. Come on, men. You are right, mister. They're drowning in beef down in Texas. I've seen a million head, roaming about wild, yours for the taking. Orin. Pass the sugar. Why don't they drive them up north and sell them? Because they've got better sense, that's why. They could drive them over the Texas trail, or the Chisum trail on through to the new railroad at Sioux City or Abilene. It ain't quite that easy, son. I've been up and down that trail and it's 2,000 miles of bad country. It's all a man can do to get through himself... ...without dragging a herd of steers after him. Still a man could make himself a heep of money if he could do it. Now mind you, I ain't saying it can't be done. But driving steers ain't like driving cows to pasture. Texas Longhorns are ornery critters. Well, only a fool would try it. Can never tell. That's what you said folks called you when you left for Dakota twenty years ago. Maybe they did, son, but that was different. - Not to my way of thinking. - Yes, that was different, Orin. We come out here to get land and build a home for us. For you and your children after you, where, God willing, we could all live. There was no selfish seeking after money. Your ma's got you there, son. Well, I guess I'd better be trailing now. I'm kinda anxious to get to Omaha. - I had a good catch this season. - Omaha City? Yessir, it's booming! Wide open, coming up fast. - Keno, faro, poker... - Gambling. Yes, ma'am. I gotta see old Flyspeck Kelly. He scraped me clean last year, as pretty as a picture. Well, thank you very kindly, ma'am. - Goodbye, mister. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, miss. - Goodbye. - I'll walk you down a way. - That's mighty nice of you. Wouldn't you think those trappers would have better sense. - Squandering their earnings. - Look, Mrs. Nordholm. You ain't finished already! Oh, Selma! That's pretty! It'll be prettier when I get the ruffles on it. Well! Ruffles on a nightshirt? That's mighty fancy fixing. Even for a bride. Oh now, see here! It's getting late, ma'am. I ought to go. No, now you wait awhile. Orin will walk you home. Oh, that gambler never ate his cake. What did you say that cattle buyer's name was? Clafflin, James Clafflin. When would he be in Omaha, do you think? Say, you wasn't really figuring on going, was ya? Yeah, I've been figuring on it for a long time. - Well! - Would you join up with me? Clear down into Texas? Farm life ain't the best training for that sort of drive, mister. - Would you come? - No, not me, son. I ain't stuck on Longhorns. Buffalo's my meat. Still, it'd be a good trick if you could turn it. Anyway, you could try. If you do, look me up. Maybe I can help you. Cody's the name. Bill Cody. Everybody knows me. Just ask for Buffalo Bill. - Uh, where can I find Mr. Clafflin? - Second door to your right. Come in. Come in. - Mr. Clafflin? - Yeah. Shut the door. - What do you want? - I was told you buy cattle. Sure, you got any to sell? No, but I will have. I want to arrange for you to buy them. I'm figuring on... Whoa! Where are you going to get these cattle? In Texas. I'm hiring some men to go down there with me and drive them up. - Where are you from, boy? - A farm in Dakota territory. Say, do you want to buy my cattle or no? Wait a minute. Sit down, Mr. uh... Orin Nordholm. All right. Now you listen to me, Mr. Orin... watchamacallit. Living on a farm in Dakota and driving a herd of cattle up... - I guess we ain't going to do business. - Hey, wait a minute! Mr. Cody! How are you, mister? What are you doing straying away from the farmyard? Mr. Cody, would you step up and have a drink with me? - I want to ask you something. - Why sure, son, sure! What brought you in from the farm? And that's it. And now I'll tell you the best place to sell your cattle. It's sold. I made a deal with a government agent this afternoon. He wants all he can get for army folks. You work fast, son. - Where are you bringing them in? - Right here. Yeah? It's a long stretch from Abilene. Look here. Just before you get to the Plant river, you hit the bad Plains. How many did we lose in the river? Twenty, boss, and we're gonna lose plenty more. This ain't no time to be driving them. I got to get to Omaha when I said we would. Yeah, I know, but we oughta take it a little easy now. I tell you this ain't no time to be driving them. - Get back where you belong. - Alright, boss. Hiya, boy. How about you and me splitting some of this beef? - Get along! - Listen, boy, you wouldn't do any shooting now. Not with the rest of these fireworks going on. If you did, you'd start them running and they wouldn't stop... ...until they got into Dodge City. Look at the trouble you'd save us. - Come on, boy. - Get along, fast! Texas Longhorns! - Shove them cattle out of here. - Sure, you start shoving them, mister. - Hey, you, I've been looking for you. - Yeah? Listen, you shouldn't talk that way to Hickok. - Who's that? - That's Wild Bill Hickok, the sheriff. You're lucky he didn't get mad. Well, I don't know no better, see. I'm just out of the farm. Now, that ain't no attitude to take. Twenty. Twenty. Twenty, twenty, twenty... Twenty. Twenty, twenty... - Neat for the faro game. - Think I'll try blackjack. Twenty. How did you do, son? Met expenses. That ain't bad either. Look here, boy. You had your gall talking that way to me. Then actually going down there and getting back. No, no, now wait a minute! My business is shipping livestock. Any kind from anywhere. I railroad them out of Chicago to New York. You get me, son? The only trouble is I can't get enough, that's why I'm here. Yeah? Well, I'm sorry, but I gave you a chance. That's what I'm driving at! You've given everybody a chance. You did a mighty big thing getting them cattle up here and you don't know it. - Me? Who? What do you mean? - You blazed the trail, boy! You've shown them the way. In a few years it'll be any man's game. Hundreds, thousands... ...pouring cattle into the Chicago market. Now who's gonna be there to get them, that's what I want to know. - You and me or somebody else? - But I... Now's the time to start, right now. Together we can lick them all. What do you say? - Where? - Chicago, that's the place. - That's where they'll bring them. - Ah, I couldn't. - You couldn't? - Well, I wasn't meaning for to leave home. Well, can't you have a home in Chicago? - Sure, but only I... - And what a home! Man alive, it's a stampeding goldmine. Meat! Meat for the taking. Free to feed the world. We can have our own roundup. And what we miss, we'll buy. All they can bring us and more too. Get me, son? All we've got are two years' start on the biggest strike in America. All we gotta do is to organize. I tell you, it's a stampeding goldmine. It's a stampeding goldmine. Why, it's as plain as day. All you got to do is to drive them up from Texas. The point is, you gotta get someone to drive them for you. Those you don't get that way you buy. Uh... that's why you need to organize, see? - Couldn't you organize here? - Who ever heard of Orinville? You got to be in a big place that'll draw them in, traders, ranchers, thousands of them. And the railroads! Can't you realize what it means? Not right away, of course, but once you get them coming... Money. That's all you're thinking. Now let me finish, Orin. - We came West, we ought to stay West. - But listen... You're leaving your own land, your own people to go back there. Fighting for money. And sickening, and dying in your heart a long time before you're dead. He ain't gonna do it, Anna. He's just talking, ain't you, son? No, he's going. It won't do no good to hide it, Orin. You might as well tell them all, what you told me. He started something. And now it's in him. It's eating in his blood. It's something of his own to do, Mr. Nordholm. And he's going to do it, just as you did. He's got to do it. He's... he's going to leave tomorrow. - Didn't say I was leaving tomorrow, Selma. - Tomorrow. It ain't that I want to sneak off. - I just want to prove them. - Orin. You're going to leave tomorrow. Selma! We can't stop him, Anna. The thing that brought us here, all of us, is the same thing that's driving him. That's what I've been wishing, Orin, but... it ain't. He's after something else. Ma's been sick, you know. She ain't so strong. We don't let her milk Bessie anymore. - Does she mind not milking her? - Ma don't. But you know how funny cows are. Poor old Bess. Of course it's true. She's getting on. She must be ten. Ten and a half. - And she don't sour? - Not much. - Not 'cause you could hold it against her. - Yeah. You can't complain then. - Oh, we ain't complaining, it's... It's just that... That... - Selma. - Yes, Orin? - Why won't you leave? Come with me. - I told you. Your ma don't need you, not that bad. She can get someone... Oh, I wish I... - Goodbye, Orin. - No. Please, I must. I oughta go. Alright, I'll take you home. Good night. It's frightful, Father, frightful. You'll get used to it, Ginnie. Why, I'll never come down here again, never! - Oh, I beg your pardon. - Wait a minute. Look here, Ginnie. This is Orin, Orin Nordholm. My secretary. I'm sorry I hired him, Ginnie. On my neck all the time. Wanting to change this or improve that. Ain't got a minute's peace. Oh, this is may daughter Ginnie... Virginia, Orin. Ain't she a picture, son? Been to school back East. They don't dress beaver around here that way, do they, boy? Glad to make your acquaintance, Miss. Thank you, sir. Oh, I... I'm sorry. Oh, that's all right. Ginnie don't like the smell of our business, Orin. Deepest sympathies, ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Hodgens. And mine, Mrs. Nordholm. Your father was... a gentleman, ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Morley. I would like to say something. But to happen so soon after your marriage. Ah, that is a tragedy, ya. Thank you, Mr. Kraus. - Who were those men? - Who? Why, they're the biggest cattle and hog men in the country. Or they were. Cattle. Hogs! Even here, now. Do we know anyone that doesn't smell of the stockyards? Virginia. Send your carriage home, Morley, and come with me. - Excellent. - Oh, I come mit. Please, my hat! Ya, ya, ya... Coming along too fast, that young man, too fast. Putting every penny back into his business, experimenting. Experimenting on what? With money from the Butchers and Drovers Bank. Our bank, ya! - Operating on bank money? - Ya. He's coming ahead too fast and he's got to be stopped. He's a pirate. Forced me out of New England just like that. And Cleveland, Buffalo, down to Birmingham even. Why, my poor pigs might as well have signs around their necks, "Smallpox"! Ya, ya, just only today at the Board of Trade... ...they was talking about him. That fellow Nordholm, somebody said, that fellow Nordholm is making money on every part of the pig but the grunt. Yes... Have you heard from Mr. Patten yet, Freddie? No, sir, I took the note down to the bank myself this morning... ...and asked for the extension. Fine. Oh, and when that tin car of ours comes in, have them call me. I'm going to make my rounds. - Yeah, I will, Mr. Nordholm. - Let me know right away, Freddie. Yes, sir. - Joe! - Yes, sir? Don't wear a black hat in the summer, it draws the sun. Tell the supply man I said to get you a straw hat. Sure, boss, thanks! - How do you do, Mr. Nordholm? - Hello, Sam. - What's your name? - Mr. Ferguson. All right, Mr. Ferguson, look here. Do you know what part of the steer it is that everybody wants? The part we make our money on? - Beef ribs, I guess. - That's right. And what percentage of the carcass is the beef ribs, Ferguson? - Don't know, Mr. Nordholm. - Nine. Nine percent. That is, if you cut it exactly right, like this. And only eight percent if you don't. Like that. This plant is operating on that one percent, Ferguson. Yes, sir. Say, how often do you wash these floors, Sam? Every night, and once a week with ammonia. Well, wash them with ammonia every night. - We advertise cleanliness, let it be clean. - Yes, sir. - Now look there, Sam. - What? There's a pool of fat and there's another. I knew you had a leak someplace. - But some fat is bound to leak out. - No, why should it? That's waste. That's what we sell. - Mr. Nordholm! - Yes? - The metal car is back. - Oh, fine! Well, how did it go, Riley? - No good, sir. We missed out both ways. - Why? The meat won't keep, sir. We thought we had it on the trip East, but the whole load went bad. Coming back we tried it again. We did just as you told us. We killed about ten head of cattle in the New York yards... stripped them down to the plain beef and froze them as hard as they could get. Then we loaded them in here and sealed the doors. They're soft, spoiled. Well, we'll just have to think of something else. - Mr. Nordholm, Mr. Nordholm! - Yes? Can I see you for a minute, sir, alone? Yes. What is it, Freddie? - The bank. Mr. Patten. - Well, what about Mr. Patten? - Well, he won't renew our note, sir. - He won't? - Why not? - He didn't say, sir. Sure, I know. Hodgens, Morley, Kraus. That's it, isn't it? - Not at all. - You're not fooling me. All right, I won't ask you to renew my note. Instead, I'm going to ask you to make an investment. - I'm going to sell you something. - What? The chance to buy an invention... ...that's going to change the entire wholesale market of the country. - What is t, Nordholm? - Look. The only kind of raw meat any company can ship is live cattle. So far, no one's been able to ship fresh-killed beef... ...by rail and keep it fit to eat. - Well, what of that? - Simply this. If I can freeze it and pack it in the right kind of metal car... ...and take it out at the end of a week or month in as good condition as I put it in, you're going to see a change that you never dreamed possible. What's the matter with live cattle? Bonham! Can't you see that the moment we can educate the people to eat dressed beef... that comes through in 100% perfect condition day in and day out... ...we're going to do away with the whole clumsy structure of small-time slaughters? Make it easier to buy, 50% cheaper, 1,000% more sanitary, and millions... No, what I see is that the railroads, heavy depositors of ours, will lose a great deal of freightage. The first few months, yes. But when they start to buy that cheap meat, why, the quantity will be enormous. And how are you going to make people buy it? You don't suppose they'll trust it, do you? You leave that to me. They'll find out it's good for them if I have to give it away. Why, man alive, can't you realize what it means when that car's protected? Not only meat, but all fresh foods. You mean you want us to put more money in an invention that doesn't even exist? That's exactly what I mean, because it's going to exist. You can't stop it. And in return, I'll give you the right to the car. You build them, and I'll buy them. And pay for them. I'll pay for every one I use. And I'll use plenty. And what's more, you can sell them to every other company in the field. All I ask is give me the privilege to buy them first. Well? No. It's a very attractive proposition, Nordholm, but just a least bit nebulous. When you get your car built, you bring it around here and we'll talk business. Patten, you're a fool! I'm handing you the exclusive rights to an industrial revolution... ...and you're throwing it away. Why? Because what you've just said proves the inadviseability of our carrying you further. Now, sir, let me ask. Are you or are you not in position to meet your present obligation? - I am not. - You have until tomorrow, Nordholm. Good day. If I only had a heart like yours, Patten. Hm? I'd use it to freeze meet with. We're in a bad spot, Freddie. - An awfully bad spot. - Why are they doing it, Mr. Nordholm? Hodgens, Morley. No bank would dare lend me money if they said no. And that's just what they're saying. But couldn't we get it somewhere else, sir? The Central Pacific. If this car of ours would have worked, I could have gone anywhere and gotten all the money I wanted. But it's failed. I tried to buy it off too much. Even if we met this note, there are others. Next week, next month. And where am I going to get it? It's all in here, Fred. Every spare cent I have. There it is. And it's no good. Oh, dear. If we could only put wheels on our iceboxes. Hm, wheels on iceboxes. Iceboxes on wheels. Why not? Why not, Freddie? Why can't we put iceboxes on wheels? What's stopping us? Why not, Freddie? Why... why can't we build them as big as we want? Put them on wheels... ...and roll them north, east, south, west! To Europe! To China! What's stopping us, Freddie? Iceboxes on wheels! - Iceboxes on wheels! - Mr. Nordholm! Iceboxes on wheels! Patten, I said you're a fool! A fool, Patten. Be heaven, I take it back! - Mr. Nordholm! - Iceboxes on wheels. Iceboxes on wheels! Iceboxes on wheels! And on the left, ladies and gentlemen, one the left, one of the phenomenal showplaces of Chicago. The palatial residence of Nordholm. One of the men that made possible the greatest World's Fair of all the ages. Orin Nordholm, meat king of the world. Hot butcher to the universe. - Orin Nordholm, you know, the icebox car. - Yes, he made them. - That's right, the lucky guy. - He hasn't anyhing to worry about. - What is it, dear? - Oh, my mother. - Is anything wrong? - No, she just won't come here, that's all. That's the Nordholm of it. Once she makes up her mind... ...nothing will change it. Thank heaven. - Why do you say that? - Because it's too absurd. If she's happy on that farm, or wherever it is, let her alone. I haven't seen her for such a long time. - I simply must get to see her. - And bring her back, I suppose. - What's wrong with that? - What a ridiculous idea. - Why? - What would I do with her? She'd hardly fit here, would she? After what she's been used to? You're quite right. She wouldn't fit here... with your foolishness, and waste and... ...stupid petty snobbery! Why, Orin, what's the matter? You'd think I had something against your mother. I'm sorry, dear. But if she doesn't want to come, it's cruel to force her. She'd only be unhappy, that's all I meant. You do forgive me, don't you, dear? I'm sorry... It was my fault, I shouldn't have shouted like that. - Where does she live anyway? - Never mind, sit up! Your grandmother lives all alone on a farm in South Dakota, Richard. Oh, sounds awfully dull, doesn't it? Oh, by the way, Mother, I don't want to go to that school we were discussing. - You'll have to find me another one. - What's the matter with it, John? Is that the cow we say them kill today? That's lamb, son. We don't pack lamb. - You brought him down there? - Only for a minute, Mother! - You brought him down there! - Now, look here, Virginia... I ordered him not to. And you took him. How dare you! How dare you take him there behind my back! I dared because it's time that the boys were learning something... Learning? Learning? Do you still imagine that I'm going to let them waste their lives... ...in those filthy stockyards? - Do you? - Yes! That's exactly what they're going to do. You... You... Listen to me! Don't you ever dare go near that place again, do you hear? Never! Do you think you're going to make butchers of my sons? Yes, of my sons! You've got to stop that! You'll kill me first, that's what you want to do, murder me. Well, why don't you, why don't you? Have it over with! You're never to take them there again! You're never to take them there again! You're not to go, do you hear? You're not to go, you're not to go! And you, never bring meat to this table again! Never bring any meat to this table, never! - Never, never, never! - Virginia! Virginia! Virginia. Virginia, I'm sorry! Virginia, please, wait. Virginia, listen, dear. Virginia. Listen, dear, I'm sorry, I'm awfully sorry. Virginia, open the door, please. Well, Mother's off on another one. Why don't you keep your mouth shut? You know what happens. Oh, gee. Why do you want to go down there anyway? I don't want to, but he likes me to. I don't know... He always gives me a fiver afterwards. - Look. - Oh, is that so? Well, you'll split that with me or I'll tell her. - You wouldn't dare to. - Oh, yes, I would. Come ahead. Hey, Phillips, can you change a fiver? I think so, Master John. We've got them! Everybody in Chicago must have asked them. But they're coming here. Orin! The Clintons are staying with us. - Orin! - Hm? The Clintons are staying with us. - The Clintons? - The Randolph Clintons of New York. They're staying here. - What for? - What for?! My dear Orin! The Clintons are one of the oldest families in the East. Oh... yes. Well, what are we going to do with them? We're going to entertain them. We're going to have an affair such as this filthy city has never seen. Now wait a minute, Virginia, Do you think it's important at a time like this... Important? When I've slaved and pulled every string imaginable, made them forget that we come from the stockyards and consent to pay us a visit, - you don't think it's important. - No, I don't! I've got no money to throw away on such nonsense. They're trying to take my company away from me. I'll need every cent I can raise. And their daughter who is just a year younger than Richard? - You call that nonsense? - I certainly do. Why should I bother my head... About your own son's future, is that what you're going to tell me? - When you know perfectly... - Oh, well, all right, just as you say. While you're at it, though, I'd like you to be sure to invite... the Hodgenses, and the Morleys and the Krauses... ...so they can see how worried I am about their stock pool. But... - Nothing doing. What do you do with your money at jolly old Oxford? Oh, don't be an ass. I say, Father, let me have a couple of hundred, will you? No! You're spending too much. - I see. - Richard. You're going to meet Jennifer Clinton. Here, read this. I say, Mater, let me have a few pounds, will you? - If that's Oxford, John, you can keep it. - I will, and I shall be glad to get back. Don't give him a cent, Mother. What a bloodsucker. Why, he must owe Phillips a nice little pile. John! You're not taking money from the butler? I'll say he is. In the old blooming house. What-oh, cheerio, and all that, eh, John? Oh, rot! - You waltz beautifully, Jennifer. - Thank you. So do you. Of course you haven't the real New York glide yet. Of course we started to get down to the real, fine-grading of beef... - ...only about ten years ago. - Certainly. Up till then it was all slipshod hit or miss. - I see. - Oh, uh... Jennifer and Richard look awfully well together, don't you think so, Mrs. Clinton? Oh, charming! Richard is such a sweet boy. He doesn't seem worried, putting on this show. Stubborn fool, he knows he can hold us off. What we need is a rumor. Something to indicate he might sell out. Imagine the panic it would cause in the market. Just what we want. Trouble is they're afraid of him at the Board of Trade... ...because he never goes near the place. Mr. Nordholm has been telling us about grading pigs. - Very interesting, you know. - Yes? I think the time has come to let you in on a secret of our own. - Hasn't it, Orin? - Secret? Oh, not any longer. You know, this is a double celebration. First in honor of our distinguished guests. And secondly... Well, I'm going to let everyone hear. My husband wishes me to make an announcement. Mr. Nordholm feels that he has done more than his share... ...toward the development of Chicago and the Middle West. In addition, he does not wish to be troubled any longer... ...by the problems which have recently beset the industry. Therefore, he is planning to retire. and devote the rest of his life to the founding of an art gallery in Chicago... ...and an institute for the development of the American artists. - My heartiest congratulations. - Mine too. And I hope you'll allow us to be the first to contribute. - Yes, indeed. - Wonderful, my dear. If you'll excuse me, please. Phillips. Tell Mrs. Nordholm I want to see her in the library at once. And Mr. Richard and Mr. John. Nordholm is selling out. Sell every share we have of Nordholm Co. on the market when it opens tomorrow. - Call New York at once! - Here, give me that telephone! Please, gentlemen, hurry! - You've done a good job. - Orin, I know it's for the best. You'll sell your interest for plenty of money. Why keep pouring it back into those stockyards? Yes? Thank you. It's better for all of us. You too, much better. Yes, much better. That's wonderful, Father! - Jennifer... - Rather! A good thing. Tired of having the chaps at Oxford call me slaughterer. - You are? - Jennifer has accepted me. Richard! On the condition that I don't ask her to live in the West. And where will you live? Why, New York mostly, I suppose. How will you live? What will you do for a living? Why, Jennifer thought of banking. Or a membership on the New York Stock Exchange. Either would be acceptable to her family. You mean they are prepared to advance the necessary capital? Oh, I don't know anything about that. It's just a suggestion. - See here, Pater... - Shut up! Do you know what you've done tonight? Do you know what you've done? If you think I've labored day and night all this time... to make it possible for a nitwit to marry a foolish snob... ...and throw twenty years of my life away into Wall Street, you're mistaken. The money I've made has got to go back into the muck and sweat... ...where it came from, do you understand? Here is where you belong and here is where you stay. All of you! Right here! In this city that you hate. You'll go back to school here or you'll go to work! And you'll start tomorrow on the same slaughterhouse... ...that feeds and clothes you. And as for you, you either learn to live happily where you are, or sure as heaven you'll land in the asylum that you're heading for! Mother. Mother! - Call the doctor. - Virginia. Virginia. Virginia! Virginia! She has regained consciousness, to an extent, Mr. Nordholm. But under no consideration must she be disturbed in any manner. Come on, Richard, John. Bide a day or two, you never know. Her mind, Mr. Nordholm, there's almost a complete cerebral collapse. Even if she recovers... I'm afraid it's only the start, - These cases almost never... - Go on! Anything we can do for her, and all she needs, is absolute quiet. - Quiet. - Yes, leave her to us. No. I'll take care of her. - She'll be all right. - There is nothing else you can do. Leave her to us, Mr. Nordholm, please. She's got to be all right. She's got to. - She's got to. - Anything we can do we will, Mr. Nordholm. You know that. She's got to be all right. Mr. McCord, sir. She's got to be all right. Mr. McCord is here, sir. Go on, Mr. Nordholm. Phillips. I've tried everywhere here in New York. J.R. won't even talk to us. - None of them will. - What? We can't raise a dollar, Mr. Nordholm. - What are you saying? - They advise us to sell out. They think the combine's too strong. - They'd like to help us, but... - But? But what? What? They're afraid to. Call Hill. Tell him he's got to come through. - I saved his railroad for him, didn't I? - Yes, sir. Tell him I want a million. A million right here, tomorrow. - Before 3 o'clock, in the First National! - Yes, sir. Wait. - Phillips. - Sir. - I'm going to change my clothes. - Yes, sir. We're going to stay in the office all night. We'll call them again. All of them! If you can't get it, I will! - Hurry, Phillips! - Yes, sir. - Who else? - Nobody, Mr. Nordholm. - We've tried them all. - No, we haven't. Who else, who else? We haven't stopped! - We're licked, Mr. Nordholm. - Who's licked? We have until 3 o'clock, haven't we, until the Board of Trade closes? We have plenty of time. Get me the Attorney General of the United States. - Mr. Nordholm! - Get him, get him, why not? We killed the trust for the government, didn't we? If he won't talk to us, the President will. The Attorney General's office in Washington. We haven't started. Sell ten thousand Nordholm! Nordholm at 68! - 68, sell ten thousand! - Sell fifteen thousand Nordholm at 65! - Sell twenty thousand Nordholm at 28. - Sell ten thousand... - Ten thousand at 18! - Sell twenty thousand at 17! Mr. Nordholm, we got it, we got it! - We got it! - What? They're coming in by the thousands, thousands of them! - What is it? - The twenty-five thousand employees... ...of Nordholm Co. They're sending their life savings, mortgaging their homes! - We've got fifteen minutes. - There's over a million here now. - Fifteen minutes, there's still time! - Yes! There's still time! Sell twenty thousand Nordholm at 8! Sell Nordholm at 6! Sell ten thousand Nordholm at 5! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! There's a rumor that Nordholm Co. is selling out! Nordholm Co. will not sell! Nordholm Co. cannot sell! You, buy me 100.000 Nordholm at 100! Please. I'm... I'm Mr. Nordholm. How is... Mrs. Nordholm has been very quiet all day, sir. Butcher! Butcher! I smell blood. There's blood on you. Blood on your clothes! Blood! Blood! I'm sorry. Mrs. Nordholm is... dead. You killed her. Yes you did. You killed her. Call Hodgens, Freddie. And tell him that... ...Nordholm Co. will sell... Sir Phillip Ivor, Baronet. I wonder what the old man thinks. I'm frightfully worried, I'm sure. I haven't seen Grandfather Nordholm for over a year now. But he'll come through with a necklace or something, won't he? That's only decent. Aha, Duchess! At last, Mother, the Nordholms become enobled. Nordholm! Don't be na?ve, Paul. - Without the name of Clinton... - Right, Mother, right. Excuse me, sir, young Mr. Orin calling from New Haven on one. Hm, he must have seen it. Hello? Yes, Orin, what is it? Don't tell me my sister is marrying that ape. What? Nothing doing, Father. - Now see here, young man! - Tell him... Here, let me talk to him. Orin, stop your nonsense. I want you here by next Friday at the latest. - What's little brother kicking about? - Oh, he's a pest. Because the wedding is on the 24th and I want you here Friday for rehearsals. Yes, yes, all right, Mother. - Goodbye. - What's the hurry? - Rehearsals. - No kidding? Wedding at St. Thomas's, reception at home, ball at the Ritz. Oh boy, oh boy. I never see any of them, but I've just got to be there. Sir Phillip Ivor, Baronet. The only regular guy in the whole crew is my grandfather Orin. You know, I was named after him. Orin has his grandfather's worst characteristics, Richard. Oh, I forgot. Ogden Jarrett is in my office. Oh, really? Well, I'll just run in and say hello and be off. Right through there, Mother. Oh, I must hop too. I'm meeting Phillip at the Colony. Goodbye, Dad. - Bring Phillip home for dinner, Natalie. - Of course. I've just had another talk with Jarrett. He's very anxious to double his holdings on his present margin. No, I don't know. He's trading pretty close as it is. But he'll just take his business someplace else where they'll be glad to accomodate him. Can you see these people now, Mr. Nordholm? Yes, all right. - You're looking very fit, Ogden. - Thanks. - Newport this weekend? - Whenever you say. Well, I'll run along. Do take dinner with us soon. Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Father's not sold yet. - Well, in that case... But I'll swing it. I'm sure I can. I'll do it on my own responsibility. - Well, they'll know, won't they? - You leave that to me. Listen, Jarrett, all I want from you is a personal loan of 100.000. I've been buying awhile for myself and I've got to have the cash. That means then that I can trade as I like. The sky's the limit. Only... be careful. It's a bargain. Well, Uncle John, family reunion! - How are you? - Very gratified, my boy. - And how are you, O.J.? - Fine, John! Have you been abroad? - No, very dull, very dull. - Fishing? Nothing so energetic. Basking and a little bit of wenching. Just in town on my annual attempt to tap the old man. - Good night, then, Jarret. - Fine. See you later, Uncle John. Well, congratulations on your matchmaking. Oh, it was very simple. Jennifer ordered a title and I delivered it. - Has he any money at all? - Don't be absurd, old boy. My commission from the honorable Sir Phillip... ...will be that little shooting lodge of his in Scotland, I hope. And from Jennifer, and old Orin? - I imagine he'll be very grateful. - Oh, absolutely. Dear Father. You know, I wish he'd see the light again... ...as he did when he bought all this for Richard. Twenty-five years is a long time, O.J., and he still must have a million tucked away someplace. - Well, good luck. - Oh, I'll tap him yet, dead or alive. I'm a woodpecker, you know, a veritable woodpecker. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Not at all, come right ahead. - Goodbye. - Toodle-oo. So sorry. The Union Club. Just a minute, please. Mr. Orin Nordholm. - Sir Phillip Ivor. - Quite. - Milton. - Yes, sir. Mr. Nordholm. Bit of a mausoleum, what. Mr. Nordholm. Show him in. This way, please. How do you do, sir? I was just trotting past on my way to see Natalie... ...and I thought I'd pop in and introduce myself. Thank you. Won't you sit down? I feel a bit silly doing it at the altar, you know. Rather. Cozy place, this. - How old are you? - What? Really, I... I should say that I was on the sunny side of forty. Yes, that's it, the sunny side of forty. May I know why you ask? - How many times have you been married? - Twice. Just twice, Mr. Nordholm. Two dreadful experiments I'm hastening to correct, sir. Your granddaughter, sir, is one of the most charming young girls of her age. Believe me, Natalie is one of the choicest feminine bits I've ever seen. And I've been everywhere. Don't you agree? Go away. What. - Is Mr. Nordholm in? - Are you expected, sir? No. The family is about to sit down to dinner. Well, tell Mr. Richard Nordholm I wish to see him. Here. What name? Orin Nordholm. Yes, sir. Won't you come into the library, sir? Thank you. I'll wait in the hall. I'm so humiliated. Phillip knows far more about New York than I do. The more disreputable parts perhaps. - Mr. Nordholm, sir. Mr. Orin Nordholm. - Grandpa? Why... why, he never comes to this house. - Show him in. - He wishes to see you in the hall, sir. In the hall? Yes, ma'am. Very well. Hi-ho, the fatted calf returns. Well, now, Dad, this is a surprise. Richard, this business with Natalie is insane. - But you don't understand. - I understand perfectly! That's why I'm here. What do you suppose it means? It's rather strange that he should come here. I fancy I shook him up a bit today, what. Look pleasant, dear. Maybe you'll get your necklace. Yes, dear, you'd better look pleasant. You've been brow-beaten by your social climbing wife... ...into accepting a fool and his title. Richard, if the name of Nordholm still means something to you, don't do it. Mr. Nordholm, if you have honored us with a visit for the purpose of interfering with our affairs, - I should thank you not to... - Jennifer, please! Richard, I've made it possible for you to do everything... ...and be everything your mother wanted. I've paid for all your mistakes. We've made a mess of our own lives. Must we drag the children down with us? I should think, Mr. Nordholm, having driven your own wife insane, you would stop meddling in affairs you know nothing about. On October 24th, at St. Thomas's Church, society's church in New York. Well, it took me a long time to get into society, but... I did it, didn't I, Selma? - Yes, indeed. - You know, Selma, I think we'll go to that wedding. You and me. You mean... go to New York, Mrs. Nordholm? Hm-hmm, kinda like to see Orin again before I die. And New York. And all those children of his that I haven't as much as laid eyes on. You should have been one of them, Selma. You would have been his... granddaughter. Think of that. Then it would have been you that's getting married. - Indeed! - And stop saying indeed. - You want to go? - Yes, ind... I mean, sure, if Ma'll let me. She'll let you. Now let me see, what's his address, where they live? We'll write Orin a letter... ...and tell him we're coming. You and me. This letter came to the house, Grandpa. I thought I'd better bring it right around. Gee, I almost forgot there was a place called Orinville. What's the matter? - Your great-grandmother is coming. - That's swell. Orin, tell your father I want a room in his house at once. And tell him my mother is not to know about the trouble in the family. She's not to know about the ill-feeling between us. - Will you tell him that? - Yes, sir. - Hurry, son. - Goodbye. His mother, really! What on earth gave her that idea? Now, now, a helpless old lady. She won't be noticed. We'll put her in some corner out of the way. - How old is she? - Oh, I don't know. - About ninety, I suppose. - Ninety! Gee, that's marvelous. - Hm, fancy that. - It's the old country life. I'm thinking of retiring into the country myself. What a nuisance! Young Gallahad here can play farm hand. Bed, feed and water her. - I'm really now amused! - Oh, well, we can get a nurse for her. Oh, what does she want to come here for? Why this rosinate castor's as big as that thick head of yours. - Yes, ma'am. - Don't you yes-ma'am me. You get him out of there before I come back. - Yes!. - Get on the job right away... ...or I'll fire the bunch of you! Watch out for the nightclubs, Anna! Don't you worry about me, I can handle anything they got! Goodbye! Extra! Extra! Wall Street Journal! Look, Selma, there's the tallest building in the world. It's 85 stories high. Looks empty. Extra! Wall Street tension. Six million shares day! What's that? What are they shouting, Orin? Oh, just selling papers. And, um... what do you do, John? I? Well, um... Well now, let me think. I will not stand for this preposterous imposition. What does he do, Orin? Nothing. Say, Selma, my great-grandmother is sure putting them through the mill. - It's wonderful. - Indeed? Say, you don't talk much, do you? - No, indeed. - No, no, now look, Selma. I didn't mean... I think it's great that you don't. Honest I do. And, um... what does the bridegroom do? Mother! Don't you think you'd better go to bed, Grandmother? No, I don't. What do you do? You'll forgive me, but I... Well, doesn't he know what he does? What does he do, Orin? - Nothing. - Then how are they going to live? Richard is settling a sum of money... ...on Sir Phillip and Natalie. So, that's what you wanted. This is why you sweated your life away. For these... these... Oh, I'll go to your wedding. I saw the Nordholms start and I want to be in at the finish. Please remember! I am not a Nordholm! Nor my daughter! And the Clintons, thank heavens, were not peasant farmers. True. And Nordholms were peasant farmers. But until now they were never liars! Leeches! Fools! Thieves! It was peasant farmers worked their fingers to the bone to give you what you have. And make you what you are, all of you. Hogs, all of you! The ticker is 104 minutes late, Mr. Nordholm. - Did you get my father? - He won't come to the phone, sir. He... Mrs. Nordholm again, sir. She insists on your being at the wedding rehearsals. Go away! Tell her I won't be there! Tell Mr. Paul I want him, quickly! You've got to help me, do you hear? They'll find out tonight, and tomorrow... I've used nearly a million of our discretionary accounts. - You've got to help me! - With what? I'm wiped out. Every cent. Well, wait, wait... - We'll be ruined, don't you see? - Oh, shut up! What are you going to do, Father? Well, you've got to save us, you've got to! Save what? What is there to save? The family, our name. Our name? What name? What does it mean? If you don't help us, I'll go to the penitentiary and so will Father. - What have you done? - I borrowed almost a million... ...from our discretionary accounts to carry Ogden Jarrett. The customers we sold out are demanding their money. If you'll only help us, Father, we'll be all right in a little while. No, no. No you won't, Richard. You're all through. You... you won't help us? No. I tried to save you 25 years ago. But you did what you wanted, didn't you? I knew this was wrong. It had to be wrong. It doesn't mean anything. There's no pride in it, no satisfaction. It's just gambling with a lot of money... ...that belongs to cheap gamblers. And when they're through, you're through. You're all through, Richard. Father, they're all waiting for you. The wedding! Come here, Orin. And... you too, Selma. Sit down here. Let me look at you. I haven't seen you for a long time, Selma. A long, long time. I want you to promise me something. Take him back West with you. Will you do that for me? And you, Orin, will you go with her? - Yes. I want to. - Fine! No matter what happens, go back! We will. We've got to go to St. Thomas's now, sir. Wait. Wait. Do you know what I am going to do with my money? With all the money I have left? Do you? I'm going to buy back the name of Nordholm for you. And give it to you free and clear. Where is everybody? We're waiting! Mr. Nordholm is upstairs, Madam. Richard, do you realize your daughter's being married in ten minutes? We're waiting for you! What does he mean? - Where is Paul? - What does he mean, your O.J.? Nothing. Nothing! Are you all mad? What does he mean, you and Jarrett? Don't be tiresome. If you weren't a fool, you'd have known two years ago. No... no! How soon can I get aboard to South America? - Whereabouts in South America? - Argentina, Rio, anywhere. Just a minute, please. Hello! Hello. - Hello! - Uncle John! I'm sorry. Hello! What's the matter, John? What's going on? What is it, I say? Phillip, I've got... I've got some news for you. Some news you're going to thank me for for the rest of your unnatural life. Listen... shhh... shut up. Nordholm and Son are... are bankrupt. Bankrupt! Isn't that nice, going bankrupt? Come on, John. They're bankrupt! Bankrupt, hm? That's fine. We want Nordholm! We want Nordholm! Where is he? We want Nordholm! Nordholm, get Nordholm! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait. We stole a million dollars from you. But you're going to get it back! Every single cent of it. - When? - Now! Right now! Take away their paper collars and their kid gloves they woudn't have a thing left. Play the Wedding March. Are you... are you quite certain, Mr. Nordholm? Oh, yes, quite certain, play it. The Wedding March! But... where's my father? Mr. Nordholm! Mr. Nordholm! Upstairs! Please take me out of here, Ogden. Please. Please take me out of here. Please! You must, Ogden! You must take me out of here! Ogden! Ogden! Ogden! Repeat after me. Praise God. Here may we live and prosper. Praise God. Here may we live and prosper. Amen. Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
