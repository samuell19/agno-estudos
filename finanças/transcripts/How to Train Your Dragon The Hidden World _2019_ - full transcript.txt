We've got something no one else can touch. - We, my friend, have dragons. - Make room! They're coming! Lots and lots of dragons. Gang, meet our latest Berkians. Welcome to paradise, mate. - Our home is your home. - Well, aren't you a beauty! - Ah, you're welcome. You're welcome. - Ah. I took on, like, a hundred trappers. A-a thousand trappers. All with burning undies. My thick, full beard almost caught on fire. Ugh. Just-just stop. So, uh, Hiccup's mom, any notes on my bone-crushing assault, or was it pretty much perfect? Oh, it was indescribable. And please, call me Valka. It has been a year. First-name basis. I think the real hero of the day was Toothless. Isn't that right, bud? What would we do without you, oh, king of dragons? What would we do? Well, we could train a lot harder, for one. That was pretty sloppy. Astrid, uh, does have a point. Perhaps you all rely a little bit too much on your dragons and not enough on one another. See? That's exactly what I was saying. Just listen up, guys. Yeah, your mom's super impressed with me. I'm like the son she always wanted. Fishmeat. You found a new friend. - Mind your heads! - Whoa! - Oh! What good is having the king of dragons around if he can't keep the order? Hey, bud, do you want to do something here or...? And where do you suppose we put these ones? Ah, we'll make room. You brought back a Hobgobbler! They're a bad omen. We're cursed. Nonsense. What harm could he do? No injuries. They're all a little shaken but otherwise healthy. Now, who's hungry? Point is you can't keep bringing dragons back here. Come on, boy. You're just asking for trouble. No, you don't, you little thief! Those trappers are getting closer by the day. We can handle them. We have the alpha. Ain't that right, bud?

How go your plans to conquer the world? Grimmel, my old friend. Thank you for coming. Oh! A year since Drago's defeat, and no further along with your dragon army, I see. You can thank the young chief of Berk for that. Stoick's boy? Yep, he and his peace-loving dragon riders continue to raid our ships and steal our dragons. Mm. That does sound like a nuisance. But I'm in the business of killing dragons, not retrieving them. - But, Grimmel... - That idiot boy has done all of the work for you, gathering the dragons in one place. Why bother me? Because the flock is protected by a Night Fury. Not possible. It seems one slipped through your fingers. Look, Berk's dragons will follow the alpha. So we'll pay you to capture him and bring the flock to us. : We even have your favorite bait. The only dragon they left us from last night's raid. A female? Hmm. So, do we have a deal, old friend? Watch out! When all is said and done, this young chief will bring me the Night Fury. They don't have a leader, just a boy. Hiccup. This is Berk, son. It's our home. It was the home of your grandparents and their grandparents before them. And it's my job as chief to protect us, Hiccup. And one day, when you're all grown up, that job will be passed on to you. Okay. And it's very important, son, because out there, beyond the sunset, lies the home of the dragons. - Wow. - Aye. Legends tell of ships that sailed too close to it, only to drop off the edge of the world, never to be seen again. But those sailors who turned back told tales of a great waterfall and dragons guarding the entrance to a Hidden World. - Whoa. - Not just a nest, Hiccup, but a land from which all dragons come. Even Night Furies? Especially Night Furies. Those are scary. Don't you worry. One day, I'll find the Hidden World and seal it up, so that people and dragons will fight no more. What? Oh, all right.

We're nowhere near ready for that. No, that's-that's crazy. I mean, he's right about all of this. It does seem like the whole world knows about us now. Yep. And the more dragons we bring back here, the bigger of a target we become. Ugh. I just wish there was some way to make them leave us alone. There might be. Dad used to talk about an old mariners' myth, of a secret land at the edge of the world where dragons live totally out of reach. Well, sailors are known for tall tales. True. But what if it's real? It could be the answer to all of our problems. How? By moving the dragons there? Uh-uh. All of us. Seriously? And abandon our home of seven generations? The home your father left you to protect. Uh... Yeah, I think we need a real solution, Hiccup. Well, we could just take Gobber's advice and tie the knot. That should fix everything. But, hey, if you're having doubts about yours truly, I'm pretty sure Snotlout's available. He only has eyes for your mom. - Playing dirty now, huh? - You asked for it.

Vanished, into thin air. - What do you think? - Uh-uh. Stubbier ears. No dorsal plates. Okay. Got it. What a night. Bud, what's gotten into you? What is all this slobbering and panting? Isn't it obvious? He's in love. Trust me, relationships are nothing but pain and misery. What did I just say? A-Am I not enough? I think that's a no. - Something like this? - You know what? Just trace your Toothless card and make her white. - You could've led with that. - Can you believe it? Toothless has a girlfriend. I never took you for a romantic. Like, ever. But it's so sweet. I mean, look. Okay. That's just sad. - And weird. - Yeah, you better do something. Seriously? I'd rather shovel poop all day than watch that. All right. Let's head back to the woods and see if we can find her. Ah, good idea. A little privacy. - Uh... - Shh. - It's boy talk. - What? Come on, let's go work this out. So, you want to get married. Uh, no, actually. Good news. I've been to two weddings. I crashed both, but none as high profile as this one. Lots of pressure, judgment, and not just by me. Look, we talked about it. We're not getting married. Cold feet. I've seen it before. Don't worry, Little Hiccy. I'm here. Wait, Hiccy? Now, I've seen the way Astrid looks at you. Everyone has. That doubt. That not so subtle disappointment. That longing for something more than you. You need to focus on being worthy. I mean, she's a warrior queen, for Thor's sake. And you are neither. But with me as your best man... your spirit guide, if you will... you'll learn to embrace your inner Viking. Show these naysayers, of which there are many, that you're more than just a malnourished runt with bad hair, strange teeth, and a twig for a neck. You're-you're really bad at pep talks. Stop letting these insecurities get the best of you. Everyone's watching. I mean, everyone. You need to man up. Do as I do. It'll be hard, but you have my word. And until I break that word, I won't give up. Hey. Hey! What, am I wasting my time here? You see some shiny thing in the woods... Ooh, what is that? Toothless! Don't move a muscle. Hey! - Someone's here. - Huh? He managed to slip past our scouts and lay a trap in the woods. - It ruined boy talk. -: Oh. - Gah, let me at him! - Slow down, Gobber. Let's get a search team on the ground, scouts in the air. Toothless and I will fly the coastline. Yeah, I wouldn't advise taking Toothless anywhere, Chief. I know this handiwork. Grimmel the Grisly. Famous back where I'm from. The smartest dragon hunter I ever met. Well, next to me, of course. Well, he can't be that smart. He left his trap unmanned. Nothing's accidental when it comes to old Grimmel. He lives for the hunt, to get inside the mind of his prey, to control its every choice. It's all a game to him. Well, he doesn't know who he's playing with. Yeah. Well, we've dealt with his kind before. Don't underestimate him, Hiccup. Mark my words. He'll be back. Then we'll be waiting for him. All right. All right, come on, give me a clue here. Give me a clue, Dad. Oh, I hope you don't mind if I help myself. This is, uh, mmm, quite good. Oh, that is impressive. But let me finish my drink. Toothless! What did you do to him? Eh, nothing that he won't sleep off. May I? Chief Hiccup. Hmm? Do I say Chief or do I call you Hiccup? What do you prefer? You have no idea who I am, do you? Oh. Well, your father knew of me. Now, there was a chief. One of the greatest dragon hunters to have ever lived. What would he think of you? He had it right, you know. Making it his mission to destroy the beasts so that you could grow up in a better world. He changed his mind. And look where that got him. So let's get to the point. I am the Night Fury killer. I've hunted every last one but yours. You are going to give me that dragon, or I will... I will never give him up. You wish dragons to live free among us like equals? A toxic notion, my boy. History has shown that we are the superior species. What if word of your misguided ideas were to spread? It would be the undoing of civilization as we know it. Hmm. Did we get him? Now! Sorry to barge in. You think you can come into my home, sit in my father's chair, and threaten my dragon? This is Berk. And we have defended our way of life from far worse than you. Ooh. A fighting spirit. I love it. Only I'm afraid you're mistaken. You've never seen anything like me. Astrid, look out! Look out! Son, get clear. Run! Have my dragon ready when I return, or I will destroy everything you love. - Grab the buckets! - How did this happen?! - Inside. - It's the middle of the night. - What are we doing here? - All right. All right, everybody. Settle down, please. Fishlegs. Have you ever seen that species of dragon before? Let me at him! I'll give him a piece of my mind! And by mind, I mean fist! Did you miss the part where we almost died? Have you seen my house? This is a new kind of enemy. And I underestimated him. Now, that's on me. But I will not do that again. We're Vikings. We don't run from a fight. At least, I don't. You might. I agree with Hiccup. We haven't seen the last of Grimmel. He's a predator, single-minded and patient. He won't stop until he gets what he wants. I'm with Eret. We have to take this threat seriously. Grimmel is just a sign of the times. Our enemies are getting smarter, more determined. We're not just overcrowded. We are exposed and vulnerable. Short of full-blown war and risking everyone we love, I don't... I don't see a way of staying here any longer. What would Stoick think of this? Hey! Hear him out! If we want to live in peace with our dragons, we need a better plan. So what are you saying, Chief? I'm saying we have to disappear. Off the map. Take the dragons to a place where no one will find them. And where might that be? He's talking about a quest for the Hidden World. The hidden what? Out to lunch. - Yeah. My father was obsessed with it when I was a boy. He made notes and maps in search of the ancestral home of all dragons, tucked away somewhere beyond the edge of the world. It may be the solution we need. We are dragon people. It's where we belong. Look, I know this is our home. My father left me to protect it. But Berk is more than this place. We are Berk. The people, the dragons. I say Berk is wherever we go. I don't know. What do you think? I'm with him! Who else?! ♪ ♪ Excuse me. Coming through. Just, let me just get right through here. Fishmeat, look, eat your rocks. Eat your rocks. Gods! People who fly with babies are the worst. I feel like I'm always asking you this question, but... Wake up, Grump! Wake up! Is there an actual plan or...? Just keep flying until we reach the end of the world. Ah. Seems sensible. So, where are they? Gone. Obviously. The Night Fury escaped you? - Again? - I encouraged it. They've abandoned their only defensible position. Running scared with what little they can carry. It just keeps going. That's 'cause the world is actually round. The sun's round. The moon is round. Stars are round. Even though they're small and stupid. Right? Stars. Don't fret. They won't get far. The Night Fury is distracted. I introduced him to your female. Furies mate for life, you see. What you picking up on, bud? The Light Fury! - She's following us! - Wow! Cool. - Would ya look at that? - Where'd she go? Is she made of sky? Whoa! Hold up, Toothless! Well, look who it is. Uh... Oh, hey, it's really nice to finally... This is perfect. So great. Not a word. Y-Yes, yes, but where did they go? I have to explain this. Night Furies can't survive in the cold, so they haven't gone north. They're trying to put distance between themselves and enemies to the east and south. And Night Furies cannot fly long distances without rest. Their flight path must include stops. Potty break! Therefore, they've gone... They can only have gone... Does anyone want to take a guess? Anyone? W-W... W-W-W... Ah, east! West. Hmm? Simple, you see? Oh, isn't this fun? Yes? No? Yes. Yes. Where is your love of the hunt? I thought you were conquerors. You'll have your prize in time. Just allow me a few more days to enjoy this. I have dearly missed it. All right. Looks like we're camping here for tonight. Well, thank Thor for that. Yes. My own place. I plan to build a hut, only for the bearded. Ruffnut, you got to stay out. Chin whiskers don't count. I see a tower of manliness in the shape of me. It's gonna be taller than Eret with bigger muscles. W-What? - Get out of my house! - Hey. - Is there a problem here? - Yeah, there's a problem. Ever since you showed up, you've been trying to upstage me. You're just so jealous. It's delusional. Yeah, delusion's a good word for it. Listen, son of Eret. When Hiccup blows it as chief, I'm next in line. Number two, 'cause I'm clearly Valka's favorite. So, you better start showing me some respect. Strange little man. Ah, don't mind him. It's not your fault you have the body of a Norse god. I myself have the same problem. This one's mine. Blacksmith's stall goes right here. One, two, three, four, five. - Where's...? Oh. - Uh, okay. Uh, hold on, gang. I-I said make camp. - Did you see them? - Not build a new village. Who died and made you chief? What? Ow! Granted, this place is very nice, but it's not the Hidden World. We don't even know if this Hidden World exists. Yeah. This place is real. Eh, there's nothing more stubborn than a mob of tired, hungry Vikings. Well, I guess this can work as a base in the meantime. It's defensible, hidden. All right. You can stay. Say hello to New Berk! Let's get building, lads. Until Toothless and I find the Hidden World. Get off it! Now, about that voice. Can we lose the whole honking goose thing? It's hard to imagine wedded bliss with that going off every minute. If you're going to continue west, I should head back to make sure we weren't followed. Great idea. I'll go with you for protection. No! You're far too important here. Yeah. Just be careful. Look at this place! It's amazing! - That's a nice rock. - What? This plan to hide us from the rest of the world. Though-though I wish it were possible, I fear it can't last, Hiccup. I mean, you know I tried to do the same for years. But greedy humans always find a way. I just... I only ask that you think about it. This one's mine. I threw my axe down first. Do you still think I'm crazy or...? Let's just say this whole idea is very you. Well, thanks for supporting me last night. It meant a lot. Don't thank me yet.

Well, unlike you, when I was a boy and I came upon a Night Fury, I killed it where it slept. That simple act of courage made me a hero in my village. So I decided to kill every last one, bringing real peace to the people of this world. Until you came along, preaching that dragons are something other than thieves and murderers.

If they're stuck with Ruffnut, I'm more worried about them. Why the long face? I mean, mine's long, but yours is really long. All face and no brain, like you got stretched at birth. Do you have a twin, too? Tuffnut took up all the room in Mom's belly. Otherwise I'd have a rounder head and more brains. That's science. My braids are like little Zipplebacks. See?

But you are nothing without your dragon. Toothless! Oh, that is just great! Now what? I think it's time for number two to become number one. He'll listen to you. - Don't say it. - I wasn't going to. I shouldn't have dragged you out there. He wouldn't have flown me back. She wouldn't have followed. Yep. I feel like the same screwup I was before I met Toothless. I can see that. Are you just gonna stand there and agree with everything? Well, you're right. You're back to where you started, but I was the first to believe in you. And I have watched you doubt whether you're worthy ever since. But you know what? I am the person I am today because of you. I never told you that, but it's true. You are the bravest, most stubborn, most determined knucklehead I know. Toothless didn't give you that, Hiccup. - He just made it... - Easier. And now it's gonna be a lot harder. So, what are you gonna do about it? Probably something stupid. That's the Hiccup I know. Suit up, gang. We're going to get them back. - What? - He's lost his mind. Now, that's marriage material. At last, faithful pupil, you are ready. Um, how are we gonna get our dragons back without dragons? Trust me. - Watch yourselves. - You're next. Move it. Um, that's right, alpha. No surprises. So, jump off the cliff in these. That's the best you've got? No, you guys are the best I've got. Aw. - I'm with him! Who else?! - I'm with... Ruffnut, that was my line. - Let's go! - Try to keep up! Yeah! - Yeah! - I'm doing it! - All right! - Oh! Get clear! Aw. You didn't think I'd actually hand you the Night Fury, did you? He's mine to kill. That snake! I intend to finish what I started. Best of luck controlling them without an alpha. Hold on, Toothless! Let go! Could've used some practice! Ah, I should've skipped breakfast! Toothless! Look out! Hot, hot, hot, hot! They're getting away! Perfect timing. - Put that down! - I'll take the skinny one! Game faces! Yeah, what are you waiting for? Get in there. Yeah! Take that! Ah. - Watch out! - The dragons are everywhere! - Incoming! - Here they come! Incoming! Take cover! Where are you going?! - Heads up! - - Thanks. Look out! Thanks. I'm coming, Toothless! You still think he cares about you? Let's just see who he follows. I'm sorry, bud, for everything. Now, let's go get her. Woo-hoo! Yeah! Number two coming through! Surprise! Sorry about that. Come on. - All right! - One more free! Four to go! Try to keep up! I got your backs. Oh! Yeah, it's almost like we're a team. You brought a baby to a battle. Ah-ah-ah. I wouldn't do that if I were you. God, I love that dragon. Come on! Come back here! Sorry we're late for the party. You're right on time. That's it. That's it. How are we gonna get him off her back without hurting her? Fear the facial hair! - Oh, I have missed this. - Me, too. Oh! Ooh. See that there? Aw. Cute. That's a bad omen. You're cursed. Yes! Go on!

Little, brown, scuttly dragons that hunted down the mice and rats in well-organized packs. Preposterously huge sea dragons that were 20 times as big as the big blue whale. Some say they crawled back into the sea, leaving not a bone nor a fang for men to remember them by. Others say they were nothing but folktales to begin with. Ah, I'm okay with that. Hey. Hey there, bud. Remember me? It's okay. Hey, I am glad to see you, too, bud. He's not gonna eat your father. Hey! How's the tail holding up? Probably could use some oil and a little fine-tuning.
