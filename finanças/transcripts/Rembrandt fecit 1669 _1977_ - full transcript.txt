He was born on 15 July 1606 in Leiden... ...as the eighth child in a family of nine. His father was a miller. He was named after his great-grandmother on his mother's side: Remigia or Reymtge Cornelis' daughter of Banchem: Rembrandt. sum, es, est sumus, estis, sunt amo, amas, amat amamus, amatis, amant Rembrandt should go to Amsterdam. I am convinced that he would be assured of lucrative commissions. There where science, art and all sorts of people and curiosities come together... ...no one could possibly imagine what this young man... ...a Dutchman, a miller's son... ...has united and expressed in a single person. Finally, or almost inevitably, the new master has come to Amsterdam. Forgive me, but I have to introduce my dear cousin to you. Saskia, a genuine Frisian Van Uylenburgh. We have agreed on the sum. Of course, he demands resemblance... ...but above all originality and sobriety. Dutch sobriety, he calls it, an ode to the knowledge of the human body. Dr Tulp is a famous chirurgeon and man of distinction in Amsterdam. Rembrandt, a golden future awaits you. It was sensible of you to come to Amsterdam. A fine and original artist will find work in abundance here. This is your first commission of such proportions. Last Monday, the Leiden kitchen help Adriaen Adriaenszoon, or 'het Kint'... ...was hanged for theft. His body was placed at our disposal. As it is still intact, it seems to me... ...that it is perfect for our anatomy lesson. It must be sketched quickly, however. Laudatory, master. What did I say? Unparalleled. Yes, my wife, Saskia, 21 years of age already. We had only been married for three days. That brooding over the past makes her so sad. The loss of three children depresses me too. It seems as if I do not give her enough attention... ...but she knows I must work very hard to make a living. Of course I am worried, I still love her, but she must regain her strength. I want a son. Money is dear. We must have a place of our own. I am tired of being patronised. Particularly by your family from Friesland. I will press them... ...to pay me. Your family sends you their regards. Those regents from Friesland think they can tell me what is right and wrong. If I do not do as they please, they will not let me administer your inheritance. As if I, a master, am unable to live up to a high status. I will buy a house, a new one, in the Jodenbreestraat. Your child will be born there. I baptise thee, Titus, son of Rembrandt van Rijn of Leiden... ...and Saskia van Uylenburgh of Leeuwarden, 22 September 1641... ...in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Would that God, the Father of Jesus Christ, who gave birth to you... ...from the water and the Holy Spirit, and who... She commanded her soul and her body to God almighty. She appointed her son Titus as her heir... ...provided that her husband Rembrandt, until remarriage or death... ...retains possession and usufruct of her estate. Upon Rembrandt's remarriage or death, half of the estate will go... ...to his heirs, the other half to Hiske van Uylenburgh, the testatrix' sister. Executed in Amsterdam in 1642 in the home of Saskia van Uylenburgh... ...in the Breestraat... ...before Rochus Scharm and Johannes Reyniers, witnesses of cred. To this I testify, Pieter Barchman, notary in Amsterdam, on 5 June 1642. That's a letter from my brother Pieter Dirx. I can neither read nor write. I am Geertje Dirx, widow of Abraham Claeszoon, trumpeter in Hoorn. I come from Edam, originally. I will leave all domestic affairs to you... ...but above all the care for my son Titus. As if he were my own. Distinguished people visit this house. Receive and address them properly. However, you must refrain from any interference. And never disturb me while I am working. -I know my place, master. Indeed, everything has its own place here... ...and I wish it to remain that way. Even the moving of things should be left to me. Do not move things. Everything the house has to offer is your pay. In case of theft, though, I will immediately bar you from the house. We certainly do not want to disturb you, Your Worship. Perhaps a later occasion would suit you better? If it turned out that our visit in any way would disrupt your work... ...we would immediately go away. It is only a trifle, so it can wait... We just happened to come here. We assume that payment of the indebted 400 guilders is no impediment anymore. Of course, the same applies to the compensation to us. But perhaps you do not want us to disturb you like this a second time. As you have not reacted to earlier injunctions, we feel compelled... ...to convince you not to defy our principal's leniency any longer. Not to defy any longer. However much he charged us to tell you that he is fond of you and respects you. As you are above all a great painter, whom Amsterdam should treat with care. You crone, are you trying to be young? What arrogance. The place you occupy, the clothes you wear are mine. Do you really believe, frivolous woman, that this will tie me to you? What can I do? -Do you think I do not know... ...what is reality or pretence, true or false? If it concerns Geertje Dirx. -Who is she? I know, I know, it is all about you. About you, it is all about you. More and more, I ask myself why I cannot say to you: Go away... ...leave this house... ...or seek refuge somewhere else in Amsterdam or Holland. You need someone to take care of you. Why I don't send you away. Someone of your position should be served, and should be loved. Whatever you mean by that. I want to take care of you and do anything you ask of me. If you will live up to your marriage vows, then... How can you take care of me if you want the opposite? Sometimes I love you, I need you, I am willing to give you what you want. While you do not differ a bit from those who consider me an investment... ...all those who want to be satisfied by me... ...whose demands I have to meet... ...who try to placate the lapse of time by craving success... ...who always get under my feet. I have to get rid of them. I am neither interested in praise, nor in honour. I am only looking for freedom, for the freedom to search. I want to show it, I want to show what I am capable of, what I think. Perhaps I unjustly compare you with the scheming, greedy people... ...who only meddle in things that do not affect them. I cannot offer you a future. Your physical condition worries me. So, if you leave my house for good, I grant you 150 guilders at once... ...and an annual sum of 160 guilders, on the sole condition... ...that you leave the valuables I gave you to my son's name... ...and you do not cause any more trouble. I give you a fortnight. As defendant was absent at first and second summons... ...and was fined for it according to the decree of 28 August 1586... ...for the third time: Geertje Dirx, widow, vs. Rembrandt van Rijn... ...famous artist in Amsterdam. Claimant Dirx declares that Rembrandt orally gave her his marriage vows... ...gave her a ring as proof... ...and claimant declares that he slept with her on various occasions. Geertje Dirx, widow, claimant, asks this chamber to commit defendant... ...to honour his wedding vows or provide for her. Defendant Van Rijn denies having made any wedding vows to claimant. He says he does not have to confess having slept with her... ...and that claimant represents the facts falsely for financial gain. As proof of this statement, a deed from notary Lombarti can be produced... ...dated June 28 last, reading as follows: Geertje Dirx, widow, on one side, and the worthy and famous artist... Another statement was set down in notarial deed before notary Lombarti: Evidence by Hendrickje Stoffels, Stoffels-Jaegher's daughter... ...23 years old, a native of Ransdorp near Bredevoort. She is also present. Stoffels has been living in Van Rijn's house for some time as a maidservant... After hearing both parties, the commissioners pass the verdict... ...that for Dirx' claim as to Van Rijn's wedding vows... ...insufficient proof has been produced... ...but that nevertheless Van Rijn is fined to pay 160 guilders at once... ...and 200 guilders annually for the rest of her life... ...provided that claimant maintains her testament fully in favour of Titus. Thus executed here before me, on 23 October 1649. I do not like your attitude. It is clear that I rightly showed her the door. Don't you think? Speak up. After all, I was ordered to maintain her. Why do you keep silent? Your silence makes me fear you take sides. Whatever you do will be best. -Of course, I hear that all the time. But you evade the question. Why am I talking to you? They say you are sleeping with him. -What do you think? I will tell you even more. Even the master does not know. I will lie in confinement soon. -In confinement? I did not know you were back. Two men have been waiting for you. I let them in. I think he knows it now. I must be off now. Notary Van der Pi?t. I just told your respected friend Six... ...what an honour it is for Amsterdam... ...to number among its citizens such a great master. The gold of your brush... -Come to the point. On behalf of Christoffel Tijsz, I present to you the bill of this house... ...that you bought as many as 14 years ago. The commission and interest due have meanwhile increased... ...to 8470 guilders and 16 five-cent pieces. He bids me to demand prompt payment... ...and to point out the patience he showed until now. Upon failing to settle this debt, other measures will be taken... ...the expenses of which will be chargeable to you. First I want the title deed. -You are just stalling. Your demand has no legal ground. -Your concern is mine. I will manage this affair. How are you, my friend? Painter of painters. Am I exaggerating, master? How is my portrait getting on? -I am working on it. Have you heard from Geertje Dirx? Rarely. She does not cost me anymore. -You are still good at arithmetic. Geertje Dirx, who luckily for Rembrandt... ...the greatest Amsterdam artist, is in a nuthouse... ...as if he thought it up himself. -Have you come to accuse me? Your wilfulness will turn Amsterdam against you, and I am from Amsterdam. As a friend, it hurts me to hear that you are finished. Commissions fall back, creditors are gathering. And you refuse to marry your lover to keep Saskia's inheritance. She can hear you. Why do we never talk for hours about art anymore... ...about the how and why of things, even if I often found it difficult to talk. You often convinced me with your prints, really fantastic ones. You always force me to discuss things that are too personal to put into words. You know people praise the bold wilfulness of your Night Watch... ...although they would have liked a little more light. Critics are only taken seriously if they add critical comments. It instantly raises them above the maker's ability. Quotation: His dark passages are the best. This man only intends to become a heretic in the art of painting... ...and he refuses to subject his brush to the approved practice. If he paints a naked woman, you get sagging breasts, distorted hands... ...dents from the corselet in the belly and from the garters in the legs. Until recently, this would have amused you greatly. I appreciate your worries about me. I am constantly being torn between what people expect... ...and what I deem right myself. Nobody can deny me the right to do as I please. I know you think like that. But what good will it do you? I baptise thee, Cornelia, daughter of Rembrandt of Leiden... ...and Hendrickje Stoffels of Ransdorp, residing with Rembrandt... ...Friday night 30 October 1654... ...in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Hendrickje Stoffels-Jaegher, living in the Jodenbreestraat... ...summoned for fornication with Rembrandt, is absent... ...and will be sued for the third time by the quarter. Hendrickje Stoffels appeared before the Amsterdam consistory on 23 July 1654. For her confession to fornicating with Rembrandt, we severely punish her. She is forever banned from the Lord's table. You are always busy. I cannot withhold my little worries any longer. It is not my intention to hurt you. Do people only perceive a lack of resemblance? I love you. I pray often. I am thrifty. I couldn't be any thriftier. It is hard to beg for money and food. Is it not going well? Is it not going well? Your request to the States in The Hague... ...to apply the insolvent debtor's act has exasperated your creditors. They made the Bankruptcy Court decide... ...not to wait any longer but to demand instant payment of your debts. You are bankrupt. Bastards. Robbing Peter to pay Paul is really useless. I have my reputation to think of. They may be my friends, as well as yours, but do not touch their money. Your company is less and less appreciated. I will see what I can do. Ah, master. What an honour to see you here. Excuse me. Six did not invite us to his estate... ...to discuss the fortunes of one man, I hope. We are not wanting in topics of conversation. Let us drink to our city and to the well-being of all of us. And perhaps I may hope... ...that master Van Rijn will give my daughter's portrait some resemblance. He wants to be paid and let the St Luke Guild decide if it shows a resemblance. Who can better judge a daughter's face than her father? If he paints as it pleases us, we can constantly trouble him, not vice versa. You exaggerate. It does the artist credit that he has no business acumen... ...and lets his talented hand be lead by what his eye perceives. It is a disgrace to art that that able hand has not used that gift any better. Who would have surpassed him in painting? But the greater the spirit, the more it tends to brutify... ...if it fails to stick to the rules. -Let him plead for himself. You know very well it is not just his style of painting. We are flooded with paintings. One can only reproach him for his indulgence in buying nicknacks. Let him speak for himself. I am at a loss. My conscience is clear. Unless I am not a good host. Rembrandt is a beautiful memory for Amsterdam. Let us drink to the future. Here's to tomorrow, today... ...and now. Cornelia. How is Titus? -Fine. He is very busy. We have to leave within 6 months. He is not a child anymore. He is still proud of you and cannot bear it when they speak badly of you. Do not disappoint him. Rembrandt, my sweet Rembrandt, what can stop you now? The trustee of Rembrandt's insolvent estate will sell... ...as authorised by the local insolvent estate commission, under distress: The collection of paper art by Italian, French, German and Dutch masters... ...a good quantity of drawings and sketches by Van Rijn... ...as well as his household goods, furniture and curiosa. The auction will be held on the day, hour and year as mentioned above... ...at Barend Schuyrman's house, host of the Keizerskroon in the Kalverstraat. Thus the commissioners authorised me, Thomas Haringh, administrator... ...to accept and to sell. Black leather book with best sketches. -Jan Six' Medea, a tragedy. A landscape by Seghers. -33 weapons and wind instruments. A small piece by Hals. -Two skirts. Chinese tray with minerals. -3 shirts. A sketch portfolio by Lastman. -A tin water pot. Book on proportion by D?rer. -An inkstand. Two Moors in a Rembrandt painting. -German book with war figures. Drawer with bird of paradise and 6 fans. -Pine table. Jozef, by Aert van Leyden. -20 halberds, broadswords, Indian fans. Six handkerchiefs. -Three statues. Two prints by Vanni and Urbijn. -And one by Lucas van Leyden. Embroidered tablecloth. -4 crossbows. A landscape by Rembrandt. -A landscape by Seghers. Ebony frame. -Christmas, Lievens. Bust by unknown master. -A Socrates, Homer and Aristotle. A large quantity of horns... ...the auction of furniture, paintings and prints of Rembrandt van Rijn... ...did not raise enough to pay his creditors. By request of Torquinius LL.M, trustee of Rembrandt's estate... ...house and premises were sold, situated in the St Anthoniebreestraat... ...opposite the St Anthoniesluis, adjacent to Salvador Rodrigues... ...heirs to the east, and Daniel Pinto, with a shared wall to the west. The owner will take with him two ovens and various wooden partitions... ...which had been set up for his pupils. Today, 1st February 1658, Lieven Schoenmaker and Samuel Gerinck... ...bought by auction the aforementioned house for 11.218 guilders. Barring some furniture and of course the tools he needs to paint. This house must in any case be vacated within 30 days. The Rozengracht is not that big, but very comfortable and the rent is low. Above all, it is quiet. To the point, the company. Yes, make clear to him that Titus van Rijn en Hendrickje Stoffels agreed... ...to set up a trade in paintings, paper art, copperplates and woodcuts... ...and similar objects... ...solely because otherwise all proceeds from his work will go to the creditors. They will keep harassing him. -Of course. All paintings or prints he will make at the Rozengracht until his death... ...go to Hendrickje Stoffels and Titus. He can claim no right or property to the portraits referred to. The times will not be easy, at best they'll get better. Van Ludich was here. He wouldn't leave. How long have you been working on this? You should pay more attention to her. She thinks more of you than herself. I cannot be with her all the time. She is not well. She yearns for you. You look so pretty. You look so sad. You are ill. I want to marry her soon. She is so beautiful. Sweet. Her father told me about you... ...about the past, about debts, about money and conditions. I told him things are better now, how hard you are working, night and day. And I denied that you still go to public auctions. He wants his daughter to be happy. So do I. Today, on this joyful occasion, 10th February 1668... ...have appeared in the sight of the Lord: Titus van Rijn of Amsterdam, aged 27, residing on the Rozengracht... ...and Magdalena van Loo, aged 27, residing on the Singel in Amsterdam... ...to be joined in matrimony. What should I tell those who carp and chide you? Your lavishness undercuts my defence. You think you are above all rules. You are so self-absorbed that nothing else matters. And what should I do? If I am wrong, say so. Take good care of him. I still have so many things to ask you. I would like to talk with you for hours, for days. Although it is no use, really. The thoughts of one moment. An attempt to retrieve what cannot be imagined. You know what I mean, don't you? I love you. I wish I could show it... ...but you should be able to do that. Do you love me? Have you missed me? Have you been outside yet? I'm naming him Rembrandt... ...after you. I baptise thee, Titia, daughter of Magdalena van Loo and Titus van Rijn... ...today, 22nd March 1669 in Amsterdam.
