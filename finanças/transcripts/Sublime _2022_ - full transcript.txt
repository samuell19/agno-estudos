What's wrong with the kid? -His friend didn't come. Come on Manu. He can come another day. Give me a smile... Have you got a lighter? I can't find the lighter. Let's go. The candle! Come on, nice and loud. Come on! Every one join in! Come on my boy, it's your day! Oh, it's blown out. Wait. I'm not going to give the lighter to you. Move your hand. Happy birth... Can someone close that window, please? Bell! Uncertainty... Who could it be? Felipe! I told you he was coming. Felipe is here! Felipe! We are under attack! Are you happy now? Happy birthday to you. Hurray! Yes, I'll come and help you. Of course I appreciate that. Alright, calm down! If anyone should be nervous, it's me. I got held up. Hold on, I'm on the way. I'm crossing the park. I swear. Does your dad know what we're using it for? He doesn't even remember it exists. Why the curtains? There is no one here. I don't want to see the forest. It'd be amazing to make a cool music video here. We could bring the instruments, put Mauro on the roof. You're annoyed that I use it first. Not at all. You are annoyed. I don't want you to die a virgin. Calm down, it'll all be fine. Magic. Fucking hell. I'll fix it. -They've blown. I brought more, it's all planned out. Give it a sing. I don't know. Slow -Weird. -Weird how? -Weird. -We already have slow songs. -Songs don't always have to explode. -Why not? Don't bother, he named the band after a computer game. -You wanted to name it after your ex. -Her second name, it went well. Hey, you didn't give me the key. It's in that thing of the light. -You are really up for it. -Can you imagine if Azul didn't show up? -Shut up. -I need your dad's amp. -What do you want it for? -I want to see if it'll do for my birthday. -Aren't we gonna use the rehearsal studio's gear? -Some of it... I'm not going to hire amps if I've got his. -Doesn't it have any lyrics? -You're the sensitive one. It's your song, think about Manu. I think about you mum. -You didn't tell me you were here. -I don't know where I left my phone. Why don't you know? No idea. How long have you been here? I got held up listening to your brother. He's amazing. Play with him. He knows you're a musician. -I'm not a musician. You are doing this on purpose. Do you want to go or not? Yes. But let's wait until it's dark. Are you cold? -A little bit. Calm down. Can you shine over there? -Yes. Wait for me here. -Are you alright? -Yeah. I want to. But I don't know. It's fine. Don't worry. Thanks. Do you want some? Come here. Let's stay like this. Your heart is beating really fast. I can't split these... things. I'll check it out... Hello, Ana. Hello, Manu. How are you, mum? -Hi. -It's confusing. Where was it? -Mauro brought it. -Start to look after it. Isn't there any more pizza? I have frozen them. You did not say anything. Where have you been? With Azul. -Manuel! -Why are you here so late? Nothing, I've got things to do. I made your favorite pizza. Yes, Mom froze them. Is she in bed yet? No, she's still sitting there with Ana. Did you fight? -No. Here, try this. I got it as a gift. Be careful, it's strong. Totally disgusting! -Yeah? I like it. Can you turn the light off? Manu, your birthday for the password is so obvious. Primitive. Typical of Manuel. Listen Manu. How did it go with Azul? Did you dip your biscuit? Yeah, sure... Listen, we're going to fill your memory. We won't stop until it's full. -Let me see. -The door. Use the key, stupid. I already tried that. Open the inventory. Not like that. Let me. The door is open now. I want to know everything about yesterday. Idiot. What did she say about the van? She liked it. Admit it, it was all thanks to me. -Hey. -You should've left it there. Keep it and give it to me later. Save it and let's go. It's late. Volume up. You once said That you needed me That there was no one who could understand you so well. You once said That we were everything But the very next day The opposite. What happened? What I have done wrong? I couldn't say a word And escaped through the window And we never saw each other again. You once said That you needed me That it was impossible to be apart for one week. You once said With incredible conviction That we were Unbreakable. What happened? Everything went wrong I could say a word And escaped through the window -What else? -"I grow wings"? I pay for two... and the beer. -Did you use cables? -No. -Did you put "I Grow Wings"? -Are you kidding me? "Ace of Coins", "Light", "All Wrong", "I Grow Wings"... -Not "Ace of Coins" for the opener. -It's not the order, it's a preselection. -Fine, but not that one for the opener.-"Light", then. -Yeah, perhaps. -Guys. Will it do? And the "birthday party"? -What should the flyer say? -"Concert". -But we should mention the birthday somehow. -It's the same. -Your photo covers everything too. -Why didn't you do it yourself? Show it to me. The money? A message. -Give it to me. Cousin Sol. Look at the photo she sends you. Give me that, dickhead. -She's not my real cousin. Our parents were friends when they were little. -The money? -Can you cover me? I've already paid for you. -And the beer. -I don't drink beer. The song you're composing? You didn't put it on the list. When it's more complete. Hurry up. Margarita won't lend us anything. We have to pay for it. Yeah, it was obvious. Will she let us use the drum kit? I asked for the drums, mics and the PA system. We'll go with your amps. It'll sound fine. Can you help me with the lyrics? Not a chance! What are you thinking about? About you. About you. Magic. Laurel, damp wood. Going back through the other side. The scented, the unknown. While the fields unearth ancient footprints the noise of the waters murmurs your words Like seeds craving to break through in fertile soil. Up to there. Tell me a word that describes that paragraph. Unknown. Mauro? There, inevitably, Passed the fragments of a tale irritated by your silence No, "impregnated". ... impregnated by your silence. By the cloud of dust that rose when I fell. That promise is alive Here, in a corner of the unthinkable. Alright, stop here. Are you thinking about what you're saying, -or just reading it out? -Yes. Yes, the first option. Iara. Now that you left, every morning, the circle around me tries to tighten. Contour of glass, of cloth. Why wouldn't I ask myself If both ends pull on the same fibre at the same time and with the same strength. It's not winter. It's not wood or laurel. It's not the indecisive river, nor the footprints in the fields. It's your memory. I can't give any opinion because I don't like it. Can you identify what it is that you don't like? Supposedly he's getting over something. But this is all to the contrary. Manuel, you continue. Why wouldn't I ask myself... The next paragraph. The next. Have you lost your phone again? No, wasn't checking it. -Bring the guitar amp, come with me. -I'll come down. What's that? Magic. Dickhead. The drums are there, on a pedestal. The amps over there, or there. Fran here, me here. -Shall we try that? -Alright. It won't be enough. -Yeah, you'll see. -Plug it in. Watch out. Felipe! Do you have a problem? It was Manu, dad. -A snitch. Turn that off, please. It's loud enough, yeah. I'm going to wait for you here... I got stuck here. On the first line? Play it again. I'm going to wait for you here I'm going to wait for you on the beach I'm going to wait for you on the beach That sounds better. I'm going to wait for you on the beach I don't know if you're going to find me I'm going to wait for you on the beach I don't know if you're going to find me The trail of footprints Don't reach anywhere I love it. How do you do it? Let's stop here. -Why? -I have to go. Iara. Would you rather have a fingernail ripped out or be thrown with a parachute into the sea? -No idea. -Come on. The nail thing. -You're crazy. -I still have the key to the van. -We're not going to the van. Why not? I'm not going to the van with Iara. It's not like you and Azul. She thinks I'm a prick. And I think she is too. Scrape it a bit. Manu talks in his sleep. -What do you mean? -You talk. -I send voice messages. What's wrong with that? -You speak without realising. -Dad talks too. -Do you know how you can treat that? Playing music. -He has to do whatever he wants. -Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Magic. She says if I play standing up I connect with the ground. When playing the guitar, one string tightens and the other relaxes. It's a sexual act, as she says. Maybe. -She said she fancies you. -Come on, you dick. I swear. -How was it? -She talks about you. I'm asking seriously. The same as always. She talks about all that stuff at first. After we fuck it's obvious she wants me to get lost. Of course. Get off. Shall we go home? I signed up for a lab project. We're gonna make an organic garden. Tom√°s' mum has a greenhouse and she's gonna help us. You're going to fall asleep. If they stay there I'll be at home alone for a few days. Alone? Yes. With my brother, which is the same as being alone. Thanks. Another one. Yes, but each one means something different. -Where's mum? -I don't know. What are you doing? Give me that. There's a storm At the bottom of the ocean I knew but I stayed I want to see it up close I'm the sea against the rocks I'm the boat that keeps on going Through the storm I'm the one who prefers to be close My cousin is coming. The one who wants to eat you? No, that's your mum. -Is she moving here? -Seems so. Here? It's suicide. They stare at me from a dune They know that my wound can't heal If I return from the sea. There's a storm At the bottom of the ocean I'm not thinking about escaping I'm the one who prefers to be... What's wrong? Are you moved by my singing? This idiot through sand in my eyes. -This song is missing something -Shut up! It won't be on the concert setlist, clearly. -Don't vote for it. -Come on, idiot, blink. -I am blinking! -Look down. Wait a moment. -Look down. -Get off. -We play "Light". -Wait for the lovebirds. -Are you jealous? -Iara will be jealous. -Your cousin. -And Mauro's mum -Well... well... Shadows on the floor I don't belong to them They come from far away They stick to my feet. Let go of everything and look around Don't waste time Let the light fall on you I can't see you Shadows on the floor I don't belong to them They want my brain They don't let me see Let go of everything and look inside Let my light fall on you For a moment When will I finally be heard? I'm wasting my time! Would you rather have sandpaper run down your back and then be thrown in a pool of lemon juice, or shave your head bald? The first one. My hair is sacred to me. I'm going to stop seeing Iara. -We see her every day. -Come on, imbecile. I want other things to happen to me. Would you rather squash a tarantula by hand -until it's mashed and then you eat it... -No. -...or cut off your little toe? -With anesthesia? No, just like that with some scissors. -You are crazy. The spider. Are you kidding? It's obvious. -Would you rather eat a whole pot of honey... -I'll puke. ... or snog a boy from our class? It depends who. I'd kiss you right away. And when? That's every morning at ten from next week. -Oh I see. -For real? -What is that? -dragonflies. My favorite animals. -Very beautiful! -You know what? Dragonflies lay their eggs in water. Honest. -For real? -Yes. -Hi. -Hi. Do you want to draw with us? -Little dragonfly, put that away. -No. Wait, I'll help you. -Shall we go out for a moment? -Food is ready. Let me draw a little more. Manu. Look at me. What are we doing outside? What's wrong? I don't know. Manu, aren't you eating? I want to sit next to Azul. They can eat later. Serve Antonia. What are you doing awake? And Azul? Why did she go like that? Why are you sleeping in the workshop? Who sleeps in the workshop? I sleep in the workshop? I don't sleep in the workshop. Does that worry you? No. Neither does Azul. It's Felipe. What happened? He troubles me. I don't understand. Feeling this shit. Manu... You have ham in your braces. Are you kidding me? What's wrong with feeling something? Have you talked to him? We've got shirts, the four of us. Trousers, a jacket, something. -It's embarrassing. -It's not embarrassing, it puts us on another level. Shall we go to my house after the practice so we can continue writing the song? Something's wrong with you. Get off. Get off. I know what it is. I broke up with Azul. Hey, what's up? Hi. -Did you put that shitty perfume on? -It's not that bad. Are you paying it now? No, later. -Tell her I picked a cable. -No, she'll charge you. Don't say anything. What are you doing with the beer? Are the guys here? -Yes, go on through. Margarita is a fan of Ozzy Osbourne. You know who Ozzy is, don't you? No. -Hello. -Hi. -Hi. -Late as usual. -Shall I close the door, guys? -Yes. What a strong perfume. Do you remember Sol? She came for a few summers. -That was eight years ago. -Were you at one of Manu's birthdays? -The house with the instruments. -Exactly. -Do you play? -No. -But she sings. She's better than me. -Well, that's not difficult. If you want to learn to play the drums, I can teach you. Not for now. They came looking for me And the found me on the ground Another day the same I'm setting myself on fire Come and rescue me! Don't ask me to stay Chained up in this town I need to be with you Even if it's just for a moment When I have you close I grow wings You're the cure for my demons I grow wings You are my gravitational propulsion -Have you done the philosophy assignment? -Not yet. -To your birthday, which is nearly here. -To you. Are you feeling better? Yeah. Do you swear? What? Bottoms up. Who is it? No one. Someone who asks about the concert. But who? Fran's Cousin. Is she texting you? I don't know. It's my birthday. It'd be better tomorrow. I've got to do this shitty assignment. Alright. I'll go to your house tomorrow and we can carry on. When? I don't know, the afternoon. Would you rather drink three beers without breathing... It's impossible. Alright, you can breath. But three bears... Or... ... let three cockroaches run down your chest? The one with the beer. What a stupid laugh you have. Come on, you idiot. Nothing will change. You were talking. Shut up. The trail of footprints... It is going to take a long time, ma'am? I need my hand. No, it won't be too long. -More or less? -More or less. -How long, more or less? -A few minutes. -Perfect.. -Shall we eat? No, come on. That damn cat. Again. A dog! A flying dog. Look. Wow, a little red and pink bird. -And I steal one. -No. That's enough now. Can we eat peacefully, please? The flying dog again! Sorry I didn't show up. -Manual. -I'll explain later. The trail of footprints Don't reach anywhere Nothing will change. Now listen to this. Listen to this. I'm going to wait for you on the beach for as long as it takes I keep adding words that don't mean anything I give up and let everything turn into noise I'm going to wait for you to come and make sense of it Don't go tonight. And there comes a part that I haven't finished yet. -My only shirt is too small for me. -I've got thousands. Alright then, you go in black and me in white. Why would you be different? It's his birthday. -Why are you in such a shitty mood? -Everyone wears the same. It's Sol. She says she's outside. -Let her in. -I didn't invite her. -Now I understand. -Shut your mouth. -How's it going? -Alright. Throwing out ideas that these idiots aren't catching. -I leave the door open, because... -Yes, Fran never showers. Give him some of your perfume. They want me to wear a shirt. -Look what we made. -It's really good. There's not long to go now. Doesn't your family make a fuss about all this chaos in your house? My dad won't be there, it's all planned out. Yes, except for the setlist. -Shall we try the new song? -It's not ready yet. Tell me if you can't read it. -When do I come in? -Come in with me. I'm going to wait for you on the beach I don't know if you're going to find me The trail of footprints Don't reach anywhere. Nothing will cha... -What's wrong? -You're embarrassing, guys. It's low for him. It's completely out of my range. We can just move our fingers up a bit. Yeah, but we never arrange songs in front of the audience. I'll go if you want. Don't worry. It's not you. Hey, be careful. Don't scratch it. -It's a piece of shit. -Are you crazy, kid? This wood is beautiful. Are you going to play? I don't know. How are the practices going? Good. Play, don't be jerks. I'll be right back. I know what you're thinking. I'll speak with Fran and I'll fix it. But well... Sol and I went to the beach and I played the song for her. She loved it. Thanks so much for helping me. Where did I get lost? Where did I get lost? Where did they... Where did they go to stay? The things that... The things that... I let the wind take them. How could it be that I didn't see you? How could it be that I didn't see you? How could I be so close? I didn't react... react I couldn't wake up I got stuck halfway I don't know if I have to wait... Or better to run away Don't tell me that you left Don't tell me that it's too late Don't tell me that you left Don't tell me that it's too late, because today... I swear I'll go find you. Don't move away, please You should know before leaving That you, for me... That you, for me... I got stuck halfway And if I have to forget I want to wake up first. Don't tell me that you left Don't tell me that it's too late, because today... I swear I'll go find you. Don't move away, please You should know before leaving that you, for me... I got stuck halfway And if I have to forget I have to wake up first I got stuck halfway If I have to wait for you I have to wake up Sorry, guys, got to dash. But there are ten minutes left. Yes, I'll leave the money here. But we have to move all the gear to your house today. You go on ahead and I'll catch up later. -Did he answer? -He hasn't read it. -We have to kill some time. -We've got at least two more trips. Margarita said we have to protect the PA system before moving it. Felipe has to do that. It's his party. He should show some interest. You paid for me today. -Just today? I owe you a couple of practices. You owe me a liver. -What a dick, Felipe. Leaving all this to us. -Don't change the subject. Social outcast... Who are you speaking to? -Iara. -What does she want? And azul? That's why you came? -Shut up, Mauro. I don't know. -They broke up. -I know. -Hey, crybaby. -Shut up. You're getting tied up over meaningless stuff. What meaningless stuff? Yourself. Look, Manu, I'm here if you want to talk about what happened. And if you don't want to talk, that's fine. I'd say relax, don't tie yourself up. Relax, enjoy yourself more. When you relax and stop thinking so much, things wil sort themselves out. Anyway, happy couples forever isn't a thing anymore. You're somewhere else now. Not at all. You're thinking about Azul. It's not that. I recognise the face of enjoying suffering. You're thinking about her. I'm not. So, who? It's Felipe. Felipe? Yes. Were you together? No. You're not missing anything. Fran was raging. Felipe made us wait for an hour. But later they were making jokes as always. -Tell me later how it went with Iara. Nice one. -Mauro. Fran wants to do the sound check tomorrow. The instruments are at Felipe's bedroom... -Mauro, aren't you listening to me?! -Oh man. Hi, boy. What are you doing here? -Where is Antonia? -At your grandma's. And mum? We had a little argument, but it's all fine. She's gone for some fresh air. She'll be here soon, she wanted to talk to you. Yes, I know. It doesn't matter. Yeah, I prefer to stay here. Yes, I brought everything, I don't know. I've already talked with Dad. Alright, bye. Yes, bye. Stop doing that. Do you remember spraying foam in my eyes at the carnival? Your dad was mad at me. I think it's the only time my dad defended me. -Do you want to play? -It's a bit late. "A bit late." I've not got any other blankets. If you're cold, we can share. No, I'm alright. Sleep, dickhead. Are you alive? Tomorrow I'm going to the van with Sol. Will you help me prepare it? -Will you help me prepare it? -Yeah, get off. You rule. It's getting there, isn't it? Yeah. -That's disgusting. -You're disgusting. I don't want mosquitoes to bite my ass. Shall we go? Give me the key. Manu? What's up? I'm coming in. We're about to eat. Do you want to talk? I've already talked to dad. That's good. I'm also here, whenever you want. They hunt a prey, they build a nest with mud, they congregate. They don't care about you today, tomorrow or yesterday. We believe our desires are superior but in the end, we pursuit teh same things as them. -Does it finish there? -Yes. It lacks a bit of emphasis at the end, but it's good. -Felipe. -He didn't come. Francisco. I've not done it. Very well. -I've been calling you. -My phone's turned off. I don't understand why they mess it up. You were right, I shouldn't have left the key over there. Whatever. It had to happen. It was me. What do you mean? It was me. Forgive me. Why? You knew how important it was to me. What have I done to you? What have I got to do with the shit you're going through? Answer me, dickhead. What a lovely birthday present. The van is completely screwed. Answer. Answer. I'm in love with you. You hand is cold. What are you doing here, Manu? What happened? When we were together, I started to feel something for Felipe. I wanted to tell you. I wanted to tell him. I messed it all up. What did he say? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? I left. I don't know. I'm sure he's trying to let it sink in. It's bad what you did. And I'm telling you... If they want to be together, they'll be together. That's not going to hold it up. The van was a piece of shit anyway. It's the big party tomorrow. Fran's sending 70 reminders per minute. I'm not going. Come on. Let's get some fresh air. The strings were all right. Yes, but now they're better. Give it a go. Plug it in. The amp's at Felipe's. Did you talk? More or less. You're a heap of misery. You don't want to go, do you? Then don't go. It doesn't matter. It's all right. Don't go. There are loads of bands that play without a bassist, you know? It's only for today. Tomorrow will be another day. Anyway, those strings... want rock. Ladies, gentlemen, The most sublime moment has arrived. What a day to have a fight. Without a bass it's going to sound shit. I'll try to play the low strings louder. You once said That you needed me That there was no one who could understand you so well. You once said The we were everything But the very next day The opposite. What happened? What did I do wrong? I couldn't say a word I couldn't say a word And escaped through the window And we never saw each other again You once said That you needed me That it was impossible to be apart for a week You once said With incredible conviction That we were unbreakable. What happened? Everything went wrong I couldn't say a word And escaped through the window And we never saw each other again Don't ask me to stay Chained up in this town I need to be with you Even if it's just for a moment When I have you close I grow wings You're the cure for my demons I grow wings The very last song of the evening is called "Nothing Will Change". I'm going to wait for you on the beach I don't know if you're going to find me The trail of footprints Don't reach anywhere. Nothing will change. I'm going to wait for you on the beach For as long as it takes I keep adding words That don't mean anything I'm going to let... Everything turn into noise I'm going to wait for... You to come and make sense of it Don't go tonight. You're like that Like the sun And I revolve around you You're like that Like the sun And I revolve around you What are you doing? Nothing. Isn't it cold? Yes, of course. It's nice, though. It's freezing. It's nice. It's alright. Dad? You want to kill me. Where were you? On the beach. It sounded good Tremendous. Can I help? We've got to wake everyone up before my dad arrives. Sol stayed over. I wanted to tell you. I didn't know it was like this. Does it piss you off? It pisses me off that you're suffering. Didn't it ever cross your mind? No... I don't know. Sorry. Why sorry? What are you doing, stupid? Move. Dad made pizza. The one you like. Have you frozen it? -No, Manu. When are we going to carry on with the game? -Whenever you want. -Today. Your amps are at my house. Yeah, keep them for a while. I want to get some equipment so we can start to record. We need a sound card. Do you record with the other band? They do, but not with me yet. Don't be a dick. You know my heart is yours. I want to record "Ace of Coins". And the new one? Yes, that one too. Take your time! How's it going with Sol? We argue a lot, but then we make up. But I don't know if she's staying. It looks like her parents want to move back again. We'll see. Come on, guys! The usual teams? -If you want to lose, yes. Come on. We're off. Pass it. -Run Feli! -Here! Come on. -No! -Goal! Come on! Pass it, Feli! Come on, I'm here. Do it! Stop! Take him! You're horrible. Mark him. Mark him, Feli! Come on, take the ball! Go get him. Where do you go? Let's go Mauro! Move! Take the ball if you can! Come on! -On my mark. -Yes. Not too much juice. Come on, turn it up a little. -Right? -Yes, right. It's enough. And that sound? -Should we? - Stop it, dude.
