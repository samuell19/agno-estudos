Damn it. Fuck. Hey, uh, my car broke down on the road - and I was wondering... - Oh. Yeah. ...if I could come in and make a phone call? Cyndi we got a guest. I'm so sorry for intruding. Oh, nah. Don't worry about it. Uh, look at you all dressed up, huh? Oh, yeah. I was at a wedding. - A wedding? - Yeah. Oh, well, we've got to get you dried off. We'll get you a towel. - Thank you. - We... we'll get you a towel. Oh, Cyndi, this is uh... - I'm Glen. - Glen. Hi, Glen. - Hi. - Come on in, Glen. Come on. - What are you doin? - Okay. Come on. You okay, Glen? Yeah. Thank you both, uh... Thank you both for helping me out. I really thought I was screwed out there. No problem. Here. Cheers. Cheers. So, listen, uh, Glen. I don't wanna be the bearer of bad news here, but the closest garage is Big Earl's and he's definitely closed right now. So, you get that thing working and you're gonna call Triple A, and they're gonna send you to a garage out in Pickton, - which is, what, 30? - Thirty-five miles. Thirty-five, 40 miles away. - Really? - Yeah. That'd be the closest motel too. Now look, I'd be happy to drive you, more than happy, but I'd just assume that you'd stay here. - Oh, no. I couldn't. - Glen, think about it. It makes the most sense. Your car will be here in the morning, and Cyndi and I don't mind. Right, Cyndi? Yeah, we don't mind. I mean that's above and beyond. Are you... are you sure? Wouldn't have offered if I wasn't, right? Okay. So, uh, what do you do? Oh. What do you do for work there, Glen? - Uh, for work, um... - Art! - What? - Go. What? I'll take them in a minute. - Art. Now. - Fine. Jeez. I'm... I'm sorry about all that. No, no, no, it's no problem. I mean... - Excuse me. - Sorry. For your phone. - Get it in there. - Yeah. He's depressed. What? Arthur, that's why he has to go get his medicine. He's depressed. Oh, yeah. I mean... Oh. It's not a secret. He tells everyone all about it. Anyway, I'm sorry for this mess. It's usually cleaner. Oh, no. Don't... don't be sorry. I mean... Okie-dokie, all righty. All medicated. Sometimes I don't know who those pills make happier, me or you. My secret's out Glen, I'm a depressive. A melancholic. How about you? You depressed? No, I don't think so. You'd know it if you were. Believe me. You'd have to take medication. Come on. We rarely get visitors out here. Come on join us. Okay. So, I broke the cookie jar, but I wasn't gonna say anything because I tell you what, my family? Look, I'm the oldest of six boys. My old man was a bear trap... Where did your wife go? Cyndi, she went to bed a little while ago there, Glen. Uh... You hit your head out there too? Fuck! You know, how you fix that? A little more medicine. Oh. No, I... I apologize for all that stuff with Cyndi. You saw it. She can't stand me. I just feel like I can't control the situation, you know what I mean? Like I can't fix it. I always felt like I was a guy that could fix things. That I take care of people. That's what a man is supposed to do, right? You're a good listener, Glen. I appreciate that. Yeah. Well, you saved my ass tonight, Art. Oh, come on. Least we could do. Least we could do. Oh, you all right? You okay? Yep. Yeah, yeah. Um, due to the impromptu nature of your visit. We weren't able to prepare obviously. Our guest room is full of all kinds of shit. Oh, yeah. That's fine. Don't... don't worry about it. That's fine. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna sleep on the couch... No. Come on! Art, that's totally unnecessary. - ...and you're gonna sleep in the master bedroom. - Art! But listen... Cyndi is in there. Okay, so I shouldn't go in there. - That's... - No. You should go in there. You should go in there and get in bed with her. - Glen. - Art. Art, no. That's... No, man. Why? Why would I do that? Why would I do that? Are you not attracted to her? Maybe I was mistaken. I haven't even thought about that. Why would I... why would I think about whether I was... I don't know... But I saw you looking at her. Come on, what? You, the looks. You were staring at her. Come on. Whoa. Back off a little bit, all right? I wasn't staring at your wife. Don't accuse me of looking at your wife. I'm not getting mad, I'm not accusing you. I'm just saying I saw what I saw. Unless I was mistaken. You were mistaken, okay? I'll tell you what I didn't mistake, was the way that she was looking at you. Oh, don't be ridiculous. Come on! What's the problem? You married? No. I'm not married. Come on, Glen, just... help me out here. - Mm. - So... Sorry. Yeah. I'm awake. I heard you guys. Oh. Yeah, we were, uh, just talking about... Yeah, I heard you guys talking. This place is made of paper. God, that's embarrassing. I'm sorry. No, it's fine. - You know, I'm just gonna go. - No, no. It's fine really. I'm the one who should be sorry. I should have gone down there and told him to leave you alone but... No. ...I just don't want to cause a scene. No, it's... Wanna sit down? Um. Come on. You don't have to stand all the way over there. Yeah, thanks. Thank you. He'd still be sleeping on the couch even if you weren't here. Huh? Does that change things? What do you mean? I don't know. I... I was 19. What? I was 19 when we got married. Well... Yeah, that is young. I was 17 when I met him. He was my high school teacher. Pretty fucked up, right? Um... It's fucked up. Like... 'Cause, I would be the first person to say to someone, like, "What the fuck are you doing throwing away your life, you fucking moron, you know?" But there is an energy. There's an energy when you throw away things that people think are important. I sound like a fucking idiot. No. But it's true, and when you're done that energy just, like, drains out of you. So, why don't you leave him? It's just, he's a persuasive arguer. "Persuasive"? Sure. I mean, look, you're in my bedroom right now, aren't you? Yeah, but I wanted to come here. Is that why you're sitting as far away from me as possible? This isn't like some sort of... some sort of fetish thing that Art has. - Is it like... - What? There's not like a... a peep hole... ...or a camera or something, right? Not that I know of. It's... "Not that you know of"? Okay. Well, don't you have to have, like, a libido to act out a fetish? I mean, don't you? I don't know. I mean, do you? It's been a while. Yeah... it's been a while for me too. Hey, that's really great. What is? That you're... that you're still doing it. Yeah, I guess so. I mean, that's... that's good for you. You know? Thanks. Asshole. So, I told him if you want people passing out from dehydration, that's on you but... Yeah, I know they've got water. Everybody's got water. Yeah, but if you're working out, you need electrolytes. Fucking dryer! I'm just gonna call you back from the car. Alex, it's Katie. Today... Today would be a really good day for you to call me back for once. I wanna ask you to come and see me, but I would settle for any sort of acknowledgement at this point. So, just call me back, okay? Just really... just call me back. Hello? Hello? Wow, that worked. You're here. I mean, this is just... It's, um, you know? It's a sensitive time right now and things are... They're really ramping up which means... more eyes are gonna be on me, you know? And what I really need from you, is to just stop calling my office so much. Well, I didn't know that I was gonna be out here this long when I agreed to do this. It's been months Alex, and I came here to be with you and I'm all alone here. You're doing it all for us, okay? I love you. Um, let me just, uh, fix us some drinks, okay? Because I just need to, you know, get work out of my head. Okay. Hey, I'm coming. I'm coming. Yeah, I know rent was due, and I'm... Hey, Glen. Uh, sorry it's so early in the morning. What the fuck are you doing here? Well, I got something I wanna talk to you about. Can I come in? Can you... Wait, what? No, no, no, no, no. You can't come in. But I've got something that I wanna show you, Glen. Well, I... I don't care. You got to go man, okay? You got to leave, okay? Wait, I don't unders... I don't understand the hostility? - Why the anger? - Look, you gotta go. Okay? Why the anger? How the fuck are you here? How did you find me? Hey, Glen. It's Sunday, man. What the fuck! Um, sorry. Okay, you have two minutes. Get in. Yeah, two minutes, that's all. It's fine. Now, I'm gonna get evicted. Nails? Nail... What... what... what nails? I don't know. The guy at the mechanic shop said that it looked like I'd run over a bunch of nails. Oh. So, you think we put a bunch of nails on the road in order to trap some random motorist and bring him to our house, like, why? I don't know. Look, you needed help and we helped you. Yeah, you're right. It's just such a... Man, it was such a weird night, you know? And, uh, I woke up in the morning, no one was there. Well, how do you think we felt? How do you think Cyndi felt? You're gone, no way to get in touch with you. And how did you find me? - What? - How did you find me? How did you end up here at my door? Uh, the... the garage where you took your car. Hmm. Wait, but he's not supposed to give you - that kind of information. - Yeah, well... Can I just... are my two minutes up? Can I just show you what I came here to show you? What is it? May I? May you what? Hook it up, so I can show you. Yeah, go, fine. It better not be a sex tape. It better not be me with your wife. Okay, try them both on three, maybe that's... You think it's this TV video button. A/V. Try... Try it. Oh, oh! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Hold on. Start from the beginning. Yeah, okay. Okay, okay. Right there. Right there. Right there. Do you see that? What are you saying? She's pregnant, Glen. - Your baby. - It can't be. It can't be. - No... - Do I need to explain how the birds and the bees work here? I didn't... we... we stopped, okay? Because... Whatever I just... Did you wear protection? I think it's probably just some other guy's. No, no, no. She hasn't said anybody but you. No, some other stranger who ran over a bunch of nails in the road, probably. How about this, just come talk to her. - What? Why? - Yeah. Just face to face. - Just come talk to her. - Art, I have nothing to talk with her about, okay? Uh, I think you have a lot to talk about, Glen. Okay, you know what? I've put up with this shit for long enough. Okay? You were supposed to leave like an hour ago. Your two minutes are up, okay? - I'm done! You're going. - What's the trouble here, Glen? - Go! Get out! - You know what? Fine, fine, Glen. Fuck me. Fuck me. I'm a pathetic depressed loser, and now a cuckold. Yeah, fuck me. Blame me for whatever it is you're all angry about, I don't care. Blame me, but not Cyndi. You know, for whatever wrong you think's gone down here, I... I think we can both agree that she's bared the brunt of this thing, right? - Right? - Go! She said there was a connection between the two of you, something... If there's any inkling of that inside you, that there was a connection or something. Fuck. Never mind, never mind. Okay, you know what? I'll talk to her. Thank you. Thank you, Glen. Thank you. All right, but the second any weird shit happens, - I'm leaving. - Yeah. No weird shit. No, no. This... This means a lot, Glen. This means a lot, seriously. - I'm just gonna get my phone. - Yeah, yeah. I am safe in my own home. I can check the locks once and leave. I can check the stove once and leave. I can check the outlets once and leave. I will not worry while I am away. I will succeed at work today. I will memorize this text and I will succeed. Thank you. I'm sorry about all of this, Glen. Thank you. I'm sorry about all of this, Glen. Thank you. I'm sorry about all of this, Glen. Thank you. I'm sorry about all of this, Glen. Well, you can stop apologizing, it's not really your fault. Okay, so what's up? This is... It's not your problem and it... it can't be and I don't wanna make it your problem, but it's just Art. He's gotten so weird lately. Like really weird and... I needed to get away from that fucking place, and I was freaking out a little bit. And... then I found this piece of paper with your phone number on it, and honestly, I... I don't have anywhere else to go. So, you think it's... I mean, I don't know. But I think so. You've been to a doctor? No. I... I was in denial for a really long time and then... here I am. Uh... No, I haven't been to a doctor. I think we should call the police. What? For Art. If we call the police, what will we say? Please stop apologizing, it's not your fault. So, what's up? I... I don't know. I just, uh... Look, I know this isn't your problem, - it can't be. It's just that... - There's a little laugh. - A little laugh on... - "It can't be." - "It can't be." - With a little laugh. - With a little.. "hah." - "Ha-ha." Right, right, a little "ha-ha-ha." - "It can't be, hah." - "Hah." Yeah. Right. Look, I know this isn't your problem, and it can't be. It's just that Art has gotten so weird lately, and I needed... A little more emphasis on "so weird." - So weird. - "So weird." Okay. It's just that Art has gotten so weird lately, and... I just needed to get out of that fucking place and... I was freaking out a little. Good, good. - Great! - It is. Well, the next sessions won't need to be as meticulous, but we really got to nail this first one. - Right, of course. - All right? Great. - Let's listen again. - Okay. Hidey-ho, I'm home. Got your chicken. I got your orange juice, no pulp. Shit. Every goddamn day! Um, did you go to the store? What? Well, you said we needed orange juice, but there's already orange juice in here. Did you go to the store? No, I didn't go to the store. You okay? Yeah. Something's not right, Glen. I just... I feel so nauseous. I'm sorry, hon. It's okay. What the hell? Glen, what's going on? - Okay, okay, just... - Ow, ow! No, no. Don't... don't keep pushing on it! I'm calling an ambulance, just... - Okay, hold on. - Glen. Hello. Yes, yes, yes, we need an ambulance. Oh? ...there's something going on with her pregnancy. We need an ambulance really quickly. Fuck! We have to take 'em. Hello, is Conners there? Dr. Conners. It's urgent. Okay, okay. Can you, uh, leave him a message? Okay, tell him this is field unit 2 and that we had to move up with extraction. And we're gonna be there with the subjects in two hours. Yeah. Now with her, it'll be more about running diagnostics. You know, tracking physical effects. The, uh, male subject, these sessions are more about pinpointing frequencies. Oh, okay. You feel that, right? It's the air. It changes. Oh. - What? - It's the air. Oh, right. Yeah, it's, um, uh... - More damp. - More damp. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Well, this place is just the tip of the iceberg. - Oh. - Yeah. Three more basements below us. Used to be used for aging different types of cheese. - Woah. - Yeah. What, really? - Yeah. I mean apparently... - What? ...the natural limestone in this area is really good for cheesemaking somehow. - Wow! - I know. You know what? I'll email you the blueprints for this place. It's amazing how much of it there is. Oh, that would be great. We've only got this one observation room up here right now, but, uh, there's much larger ones going in downstairs. And here we are. Hi. Shannon, this is Julie. - Hi. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Pleasure. Julie is our, uh, tech master. Uh. Oh. There he is. Great. You all set? You ready? Yeah. All right. You know this better than he does at this point. - I know you're ready. - Okay. Oh! You will want to put one of these in. - Oh. - Yeah. Of course. Of course. Yeah, just one should be enough to disrupt the... - Right. - Yep. Just make sure you... How's that? - Okay. - It's okay. - Okay. - Okay. Hey. I'm Shannon. - Glen. - Glen. It's lovely to meet you, Glen. Yeah, you too. So, um, did they explain what we're gonna be doing here today? No, the doctor just said that I would be meeting with you and he told me that, um... He gave me this. Which... How did they, um... Yeah. I know. It's... it's, uh... it's weird. It's weird, um. I can't... Explain it to me at this stage in the process. Yeah. That's the refrain around here. But you must understand how this, you know, - getting this, seeing this. - It's... ...it's disconcerting. I don't know what it has to do with any of the... How does one thing have anything to do with the other? I don't... I don't see the link between the two things. Yeah. Well, it'll all make sense as we go along. I promise. Do you want to give it a try? Yes, yes. Let's go. Here you go. Thank you. I'm sorry about all this, Glen. "Please stop apologizing. It's not your fault." "So, what's up?" I don't know. I just... Look, I... I know this isn't your problem and it just... it can't be. It's just Art has gotten so weird lately, and I needed to get away from that fucking place and I was just... I was just freaking out. - Did you get it? - Yes, I did. Hello? Glen? Cyndi? Fuck. Fuck. It's a... It's a... setback. Yes, a significant setback, but it's under control. I just... I didn't wanna move to plan B without informing you first. I... I understand. I... I get that. I'm... I'm just wondering, that if at this late stage maybe the simpler option that I suggested initially, might be easier. I mean, be easier for me. Okay, for the last time I have compromised my principles enough on this account. I will not be made a hypocrite. If... if you want to impress me, if you want me to vouch for your technique, then just handle this, okay? Without having to call me in the middle of the night. Hey. Hey. Are you okay? That dream again? Were you back in high school? Yeah. Oh, Jesus, when are you gonna graduate? Seriously? I don't want to do this today. I don't wanna do it anymore. What's... what's wrong? I don't wanna play any more role-playing games until I know what the fuck is going on around here. I got questions. Okay. Cyndi, is she... is she okay? Was she... was she brought here? Is she here, or she's somewhere else? Or do you know where she is? Or is... was she hurt in the accident or was the... was... was the baby hurt? I just want to know if she's okay. Okay. What else? Um, I'm having a pretty fucking hard time wrapping my head around how doing all this role-playing shit is supposed to help me get my legs back. Do you wanna... help me understand this process I'm supposed to be so trusting in? Okay. Well, what... Just... Glen, hold on one second. - Could you just tell me... - I'll be right back. Hold on. Okay. Okay, um... so, here's what I can tell you. Cyndi is fine. You shouldn't be concerned with her. She's safe. Okay. As for the process. Our process addresses the physical via the psychological. So, it's a new treatment, but it has extremely high results, and we are the only facility that's taking cases like yours. Okay. Shall we start again? Going forward I'm gonna need a lot more questions answered if I'm gonna cooperate. I'll do my best. I just want to know that... all of this is leading to me somehow... getting up out of this chair someday. - It is. - Okay. Trust me. How did your relationship with Arthur begin? Um... he was my teacher. He was a really good teacher. He was really nice to me, to be honest. He took me seriously and I liked that. I mean, he... I had a crush on him for a while but nothing real, just innocent, you know? Okay, hold there. And when did it become something real? I guess when he found out that I liked him. And how did he find out? I stupidly volunteered to be hypnotized at my high school homecoming lock-in party. This guy, the hypnotist guy, he... he asked if we had a secret that no one else knew. And we were supposed to write it on this imaginary piece of paper, but before we even got to that part, I just blurted out that... ...I had a crush on my English teacher. Okay, hold there. Okay, then what happened? He must have found out... because a few days later he called me and he said that he was sorry... for all the kids making fun of me. Which, looking back now, was just probably his roundabout way of letting me know that he knew, you know? Because then he would just start calling to talk. But it... it wasn't anything serious. Not until the next summer. Okay, hold there. Hello, stranger. This just isn't working for me. I'm lonely. I can't live like this. We're almost through this, honey, okay? If we can get through this, we can get through anything. All right? Drinks? Yeah, sure. Okay. Go ahead and lie down, Katie. Katie, can you hear me? Mm-hmm. Katie, the conversation you had tonight with Alex had a deep impact on you. You now feel comforted and calmed. You no longer question his commitment to you. You are willing to wait the amount of time he's asked you to. You will no longer feel compelled to try and contact him, at work or on his cell phone, or at home. You know he loves you. So, you will not go seeking reassurance in this manner. You are secure and content in the knowledge that soon you two will be together. When you awaken, you will awaken with a memory of how you made love for a very long time. You had two orgasms. And faked another because you were getting tired. Don't believe what the fake news media is spreading to try and stop me. I've gotten out of tough spots before, but we're being outspent and I need your support now more than ever. This November, make the choice to protect our streets, protect our borders, and protect the unborn. I'm Alex Harris, and I approve this message. I'll be back soon. Because I don't have time to talk about this right now. I was. Fine. Yeah. I... I was hurt. Look, it's hard because I had a similar thing - happen to me. - No, you didn't. Will you let me finish? - What I mean is... - No, you didn't. Jesus Christ. What? What are we doing? Is that it? Is this it, honey? I don't know. It was a double whammy. Not only did you not believe me, but then you took the side of the guy that assaulted me. That's not what I said. Look... Nope. What I was trying to say... And then you go on to say that you've been accused of... I wasn't accused. I told you it was a misunderstanding. I don't... I can't... I can't talk about this right now. I have... I'm really late for work. I... This is a very important day for me and I can't talk about this right now. I can't. Okay. But would you please call me later then? I don't know. I don't know if I'll call you. I don't know. - Will you? - I have to go! I have to go! I said, I just said a minute ago, I have to go! End call. Hi, I'm so sorry that I'm a little bit late. Um... I, uh... How are you? - I am good. - Great. - How are you? - I'm all right. I'm, uh... I'm alright. I just, uh... it's, uh... I'm a little a little sweaty. I just ran all the way in here, and it's a little bit weirdly, like, hot today. I don't know, it's... So, today's session is going to be a little bit weird, and I just wanna warn you ahead of time. - Okay. - I'm gonna show you some things, and they're gonna be... probably pretty upsetting. Okay. Cyndi, do you recognize this man? No. Do you wanna look closer? Mm, no. Okay. So, um, this is Mr. Munberg, and he is your 11th grade English teacher. No... ...that's... that's not him. This is Arthur Thomas... also known as, um, The Amazing Arthur... hilarious hypnotist, available for parties and corporate events and birthdays. No, uh, I think you have them backwards. That's my husband, and that's my English teacher, I don't... I don't know this guy. So, um, what we think might have happened is that... when Arthur met you at the lock-in that, um, he began... a state of, uh, sustained suggestion that continued until, um, just now. Please, by any and all means, avoid using the passive voice. "The chalk was held. Words were spoken." Passive voice gives us all the causes without any effects. It gives us the doing and the done as if no one did them. Oh, my god. Hi. Thank you. E-zero-one-four-four. Didn't you say you gotta go to work today? Alpha, function. Uh, yeah. I don't know I didn't feel up to it. I haven't been sleeping well. Oh, well, then you should take the bed tonight. No, no, it's fine. The couch is fine. It's... - It's not that. It's... - Dreams? Yeah. I just don't really feel like sleeping. Yeah, same. Maybe we should get out of here. Take a walk or something, get some fresh air. I feel like we've been cooped up in here for so long. We could... What? Nothing. It's nothing. Well, you... Just say it. It could be important. No, it was just, like something, like, in my mind's eye. Whatever. Okay. Well what happened? I was... seeing the scene. I'm remembering the scene or whatever and I was looking at Cyndi and just for a second, like a flash. She wasn't pregnant. Write that down. Did you get that? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I got it. E-zero-one-six-four. Could you just excuse me? Just one minute. - I'm sorry. - Okay. I don't understand. I don't get it. - The pregnancy thing? - Yeah. Why would Art make them believe that they were pregnant? Especially her, so far along in the pregnancy. I mean she'd give birth and there'd be nothing there. Hmm. I hadn't thought of that. Where was the baby gonna come from? First off, I wanna thank you for, uh, coming down here on such short notice. Of all the couples we looked at, you met all the necessary requirements and yours seemed the best, most stable home for the child. To be honest, uh, we were pretty far down the road with another couple, but, uh, well, they backed out. And after going over your application, I can tell you I'm glad they did. - Oh. - So, yeah. So, let's move forward with this paperwork. As I believe I mentioned in our phone interview, our agency is a bit different in that we specialize in the anonymity of the birth mother. So, your names will be on the, uh, birth certificate and there will be no paper trail back to the birth parents. So, if you're ready, clear, okay to proceed with this. - Yes, yes, we're ready. - Great. Okay. I'm sorry for the cramped quarters in here. We're in the process of installing a few larger rooms on the lower levels. We were just so excited with the progress we're making, we just couldn't wait to show you. Now, as you know, I've been working in this vein of research for going on two decades now. Now, up until a few years ago, I was working with a partner in developing the techniques you're going to see demonstrated here today. His area of expertise was in electrical engineering. And when he terminated our partnership, um, he hobbled the technical aspect of our project here. But, as we recently learned, he actually continued his research, albeit in a more informal manner. But thanks to the help and cooperation of some of you here in this room, we were able to gain access to the subjects he was testing it on. And we've been able, with the help of my incredibly capable colleague, - Shannon Darowicz... - Hi. ...to sort of reverse engineer from there, and in fact, expand upon the discoveries he made in the field as it were. Glen. Glen, we're gonna try something a little new today. Is that all right? Since we've been able to identify the relevant audio frequencies, uh, the possibilities that have opened up have been immense. Glen, I'd like you to shut your eyes and take a deep breath. Raise your right hand. Here, we have a subject instantaneously placed into a state where he's receptive to hypnotic suggestion. Put your right hand down. Now, put your left hand on your head. No counting or swinging pocket watches necessary. Glen, why is your hand on your head? I felt a drip. I think there's a hole in the ceiling. Must be a leak. See the subjects themselves generate the necessary narrative to integrate the suggestion into their worldview and memory. We've been astonished, actually, at how quickly they've been able to absorb and adopt changes which are sometimes quite drastic. Thank you so much, Glen. I'm gonna have that checked out. It's pretty amazing on its own, but we knew about his frequency well before this stage. And what we've been trying to get at, and what I assume you're all here to see, is a sustained state of suggestion. People have been able to influence the minds and wills of others, uh, for thousands of years using these techniques. Sometimes the influence is lasting. A person may quit smoking or see a decrease in general stress levels, but outside of the hypnotherapeutic session, these results are contingent on the subject being primed, well ahead of time, for achieving a certain goal. But what's been much harder, uh, impossible really, is to create a sustained state of suggestion without the subject's knowledge, and this is where we've made our most exciting breakthroughs. Shannon, could you ask him to stand. What... - Go on. - What? - Glen? - Hmm? Would you stand up for me. Why do you want me to try to... you want me to try to stand? Could you just... Could you please try to stand up, please? What the fuck! What the fuck! What the fuck did you do? You can save a lot on security personnel when those in your custody don't know they can run away. What the fuck did you do? Oh, my God! Shannon, did you know that Glen could stand? No, I thought... And how long have you been working with him? Five... six weeks. You will find in your packets, not only Mrs. Darowicz's professional bona fides, but two signed medical reports from doctors who independently studied the subject. Now, these reports certify that the subject suffers from paralysis due to an unknown but physiological cause. What is the subject's SHSS score? It's high. It is high. His susceptibility to suggestion is probably how and why he was chosen by my former colleague. But we are currently, uh, working on the abstracts of several experiments with test subjects who scored low on the SHSS, as well as optimizing a cocktail of water-soluble vitamins, uh, that increase and deepen susceptibility to suggestion. Also, might I add that trauma or a "dreamy disposition" can also increase susceptibility. What's this in the abstracts about second and third tier suggestion? What does that mean? Why don't we move upstairs to a more comfortable space before we start the Q&A. What the fuck? Did you know he could stand? - What are you, wiping him? - Yeah. I... How many times have you wiped him? I'm not supposed to tell you. You were amazing, Shannon. Uh... I'm glad that it was a success. It was more than a success. I'm sorry I sprung the standing thing on you. I should have let you in on that ahead of time. I just needed a way to show them it wasn't just some dog and pony show. What else are you hiding from me? Julie said that you've been wiping him. Look, up until now, it was necessary to keep you and Glen on the same page, so there could be a trust between you. We wouldn't have been able to get to where we've gotten without that trust. I'm sorry for keeping you in the dark. Everybody that was there was military contractors. There was no one there from the VA. I thought... Dr. Conners, I thought that our intended application for this was for therapeutic purposes. PTSD... Therapy is the application we've been working towards and that's what the bulk of the research hours have been spent on, but, you know, money for R&D is not in therapy. They've been bankrolling this the whole time? What is... I thought you were on board with this project. I was. I just... This is seeming like a very different project than the one that I signed on for. My background, as you know, is in abuse counseling. We are doing real, true good here, Shannon. Don't lose sight of that. Are we building a weapon here? Is that what all this is? I never would have shown them this if we hadn't found the reversal frequency. Unfortunately, for good science to survive these days, it sometimes has to be a... sheep in wolf's clothing You didn't even mention the reversal frequency. Look, I've invested too much. I've put too much time into... I forgot I have a call coming in a couple minutes. Look, I'm sorry I blindsided you. I won't do that again. Hmm? Let's keep having these conversations. Okay. For now, I'm gonna lighten your one-on-one load for next week. What? I'd like to give you some time to think this over and make sure it's a project you're still invested in. I have a... I have a session with Cyndi in 20 minutes. Fine. Meet with her today, and Gretchen will take over for you on Monday. You know what to do. Was I... Did we even get married? Not legally, no. God, I'm so fucking stupid. I mean, how could I let this happen? This is something that was done to you. But was it? Because it's weird, I remember doing all of it. It's... It feels wrong now, but... how do I trust that side of myself that's telling me that. I mean, am I different now? Am I smarter? How... How can I, like, know what's real? So, um, this is gonna be our last session - for a little while. - What? Um, there is another counselor that is gonna be taking over. Her name's Gretchen. She's new and, um... I think you're really gonna like her. I'm so sorry... but I have to go and I need those papers back, so did you get a chance to look at all of them? Um, just the first two. The last one? Yeah. Okay. So, goodbye for now. I'm sorry this is so sudden. Please, trust me. I do. Good luck, Cyndi. It's been a pleasure working with you. - Thank you, Shannon. - Absolutely. Shit. So, apparently Arthur had a minor... psychological breakdown. And everybody was very surprised when, upon his recovery, he didn't return to the project. And I guess that's when he sort of disappeared. Um, yes, I'd like an economy. Yeah, that would be great. Shit. Sorry. What? A Kia Rio? Yeah, that... that would be perfect. Can I pick it up tomorrow morning? Okay, great. Thank you so much, see you then. Bye. Hi, hi. Hey. Oh, uh... This is Scott, my nephew. Yeah, uh... great. Uh... uh, have a seat, my friend. Pull up a chair. Uh, thanks for, uh, coming all the way out here. Yeah, it's nice. Uh... Oh, yeah. The, uh... this. Okay. The office was perfect. Thank you. Uh, meeting went, uh, well with the couple, the parents. Um, I think we're all ready for the handoff. No way to trace the baby back to you or Katie. Yeah, I went to see Katie last night. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, you know, I gotta say, I'm very impressed. All right. Great. Well, I'm glad. Yeah, those are the same techniques that I think would be beneficial for the campaign, you know? - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, I've got some ideas. - Ideas? - I do. I've got some... some good ideas. - You've got some good ideas? - Yeah. I think we start with, um... ...radio commercials for one. And then from there move to television. I could really hit the masses. Yeah. Do you think... Do I... do I think what? You think it was a good idea to fuck my girlfriend, Art? - What? No, no, no. - You think that's part of what I had in mind when I hired you? Wait a second, no that's not... No, it's... it's a suggestion. - I mean, that's how... - Pretended to be me? No, that's how she knows she's not pregnant. I didn't actually have sex with her. No, no. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Every time you went over there? No that's not what I... Wait, wait... I should have never let you get involved, you sick fuck. You fucking sweater-vest-fuck. Okay. It's my mistake for trusting you. Now, the deposit for the amount that we agreed upon will be in your bank account this Friday. What I was hoping to communicate on this visit, Art, was how I emphatically I wish for you to leave this part of the country. Look at that, you got blood on your stupid sweater. Asshole. Hi, Kevin. Um... I'm so sorry to bother you, but I have lost my ID. I have looked everywhere for it and, um... ...I think that it's in my office, but I can't get into my office because I need my ID to get in. So, can you... can you help me? Uh... I'm not supposed to leave my post. Okay, um, is there anybody else here who could... My relief comes at 11:50. Please. I don't know what I could have done with it. Oh, God. Thank God. You're here. - What are you doing here? - Get in. Get in, get... I've been here. What happened to your legs? - What happened to our baby? - What? Our baby, you were pregnant? What the fuck are you talking about? What do you mean, what the fuck am I talking about? - Where are we going? - There's supposed to be a door. Kevin, I don't know. It could be anywhere. We could be looking for this all night. I'm so sorry, you probably have to get back to your post. Thank you so much for helping me with this. Oh, God! Shit. Fuck. Sorry, sorry! Are you okay? - Goddamn. - Are you okay? My feet, my feet! No, no, leave it here! Leave it. Leave it, leave it, leave it! - Where are we going? - A hotel. Couple hours from here. She got us a room. Uh, it's so weird. Did my legs work this whole time? I can't figure it out. What is going on? I don't know. I don't know anything. She said it's not safe for us there anymore and there's a lot they haven't told us. Yeah. That sure as shit, that's true. She gave me that backpack and told me to listen to the CDs. She said it wasn't safe? I guess we'll start with number one. So, apparently Arthur had some sort of nervous breakdown and everyone was very surprised when he didn't return upon his recovery. And I guess after that he just sort of disappeared. ...where he had continued his research by, as Dr. Conners says, going rogue... ...and what we were trying to do was... ...we basically stole you from Arthur... This road just keeps on going? It's so weird. But I... I think we're almost there. Wait, there it is. Okay. Thank God. Our salvation. I bet you're relieved... that I'm not pregnant. That you didn't get me pregnant. No, I... I wouldn't... I mean, I would have... - No, I'm sorry, I should... - I'm sorry. No. It's... it's no... It's just... I don't... I don't know. Thank you for, um... Just thank you. I'm gonna go to bed. Goodnight. Goodnight. I'm just saying that generally, we need to be more diligent. I... I understand. Checking who's coming in, who's going out. I understand. - Good morning. - Morning. - Oh. - Let's head in. Hi, Karl. Wait. You don't think that I... I... I lost my ID last night. I looked for it for over an hour. You wouldn't... When Mr. Sweeney comes in you can ask him. They're... I did not... Oh, I'm going to talk to Mr. Sweeney. He's on his way in. I just wanted to hear from you first. What are you gonna do? I have come to no conclusions. I'm just trying to deal with this pile of shit that fell in my lap this morning. You know what? I'm gonna have you work on a demo for a corporate client today. Observation Room D. Gretchen will fill you in. Thank you. I know my head's royally fucked right now, but I'm getting the craziest déjà vu from this place. Me too. It looks like where we met. What do you mean? It looks like one of those rooms in the hotel where we met. We didn't meet at the hotel. It was your friend's wedding, right? Okay, ladies and gentlemen, so as we've just seen our three volunteers here have received parking tickets on their cars. That's gonna cost them a lot of money. That's very sad for them. But I'm gonna change their fates right now, with the help of my lovely assistant, Cyndi. Cyndi? Oh, there she is! All right. Big round of applause for my lovely assistant, Cyndi. So, now men, Cyndi's gonna walk by and touch those parking tickets and turn them into jackpot lottery tickets worth one million dollars. Yes. Okay? Cyndi, please. I won. Winner! Uh-oh... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We don't want anyone stealing these tickets, do we? Huh? So, we're gonna hide them in a very, very special place. Go ahead and hide those tickets, boys. Yeah, that's it, don't let anyone find them. Now, later on this evening, should someone from our lovely audience ask to see that ticket, you're gonna show them that ticket. Right? Good. Okay, let's give them a big round of applause. Back to your seats, boys. All right. - Hey. - Put this somewhere safe, okay? What are you talking about? We met later that night, at your house. At my house? I don't have a house. We lived in an apartment. Kevin, give me your ID. Right fucking now! I mean, what cute girls like someone that sits on his chair? - Dude? - Hey guys, this is me. Oh, all right, later. Goodnight man. Oh, wait. Do you have that winning lottery ticket? Oh, yeah. Goodnight, Glenifer. - Glenifer! - Oh, my God. God fucking damnit! Fuck. Now, this place is just the tip of the iceberg. - Oh. - Yeah. Three more basements below us. It's amazing how much of it there is. You okay, Glen? Come in. Getting your car fixed is expensive, Glen. You give the mechanic all of your cash. And you withdraw 1,500 dollars from your checking account to cover the rest. You have no choice. You will go into the adjoining room and you will lay down on the bed. Tomorrow, you will remember spending - a very special evening... - Special fucking evening. ...with Cyndi. You'll have sex twice. You will feel a real connection. You will feel, in the end, that she has seen you, like no other woman before. So, he... he... he what? He fucking... He... I'd... How the fuck did... Did we even... Is there water running? - Shannon. - What the...? Okay, um, take this. This will open the door. Okay. Uh, there's just one more thing, and it's just a precaution. - I need you to put these on. - Okay. Okay. I don't hear anything. That's okay. Just listen carefully. In a moment, I'm gonna play a tone for you, and you're going to remember it. You're gonna remember it. You're gonna remember it no matter what anyone tells you or says. No one can make you forget it. And, if you ever feel like things aren't right. If you ever feel like things don't make sense around you, or you get a bad or suspicious feeling, you'll remember this tone. What's that? Shannon don't. Shannon. It was my plan to bring you in on this eventually. - No, it wasn't. - Yes. We have to bring them out in stages. - You tricked me. - No, no. No. Yes, you fucking did. Are you using - the tones on me? - No, no, no. Shannon, you're a trusted colleague. I would never. Look, we have to bring them out of the suggestion in stages. - Stay the fuck back! - Shannon. We have to bring them out in stages. Otherwise... I said stay the fuck away from me! What is it? We never left. What do you mean? We never left the... Sleep frequency! Sleep frequency. Knock them out! Cyndi, Glen. Let's go! Come on. Come on. - Cyndi, come in. - Glen! Come on! - Glen! - Glen, come on! Come on, come on, come on. Fast! - Come on! - We need to get out. You okay, Glen? Where are we? You okay, Glen? Just a few more steps! Come on, Glen. Move your legs! Where are we? Where are we? - Where are we? - Just trust me, Glen. Let's go. Come on. There's the exit. Come on. Come on. Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in. Come on. Come on. We're gonna get out through the front door. Put him in the back. Come on. I don't even know if we can go to the police with this. I think we should. I mean, it's pretty fucked up. Are you okay? Define "okay." Yeah, I know. ...to remind listeners to check their tickets. The Powerball is up to a staggering... ...280 million dollars and we just found out, the ticket has already been purchased. Your dreams may have already come true. And we're back with 30 minutes of uninterrupted rock and roll Sending this next one out there to all you dreamers. God. Thank God you answered. What? No. Mom, no. Well, I've been trying to call you for weeks but you never pick up. No... Mom, just listen okay. Just listen. Listen. I'm pregnant. Here he is, ladies and gentlemen, the man of the hour, the man that I'm proud to call my husband, your re-elected senator, Alex Harris!
