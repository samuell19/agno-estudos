I came to see Emilio. He's here already. - Give me a rum. - Sorry sir, only champagne. - I don't want champagne, I ordered... - Please! Those are my orders. - Who from? - Emilio. - Say, how about some champagne? - Yes, we're both really thirsty. I'm not surprised after all that exercise. But, don't you think you ought to freshen up after that lovemaking? Lovemaking? Are you kidding? We make love only in our penthouse. In the company of a gentleman who's rich and generous. And would appreciate your talents. - Aren't you a gentleman? - Aren't you generous? Do you always finish each other's sentences? Yes, we do everything together. We both have the same tastes. But we also like to try it with a guy who's well hung. And generous cos money really turns us on. Well, you're just a couple of hookers, huh? - A girl has to earn a living. - We're practically virgins. And virgins would like a glass of champagne, right? That's right, we're completely dry. And we're hoping you'll make us all wet again Do you think you can make it wet again? Why don't we go some where and give it a whirl, huh? You've nothing to lose, you might enjoy it. - You're real generous, cheers! - To the three of us. And to Emilio. Do you know Emilio? Who doesn't know Emilio? And who can say that he really knows him? - I'm supposed to meet him here. - Oh, how interesting. You're Harry aren't you? Harry Feldman. - Who told you? - Emilio. - To Emilio. - To Emilio. - Say, are you bored of that bottle? - Leave it, Oscar. Emilio will be angry if you refuse his champagne. I've had enough, let's ask for the bill. The bill? What bill? - Give me a whisky. - Right away, Inspector. Don't worry about anything, just sit back and relax. Emilio's paying for everything. - Everything? - Everything. - But when's Emilio coming here? - He's not coming here. He said he'd meet you at the apartment. He asked us to meet you here and to make his apologies. And also to keep you company. And he paid us to take you home and entertain you. So why don't you stop asking questions and just enjoy the evening? Why isn't he coming here? Tonight he had to attend a very elegant charity affair. He must think I'm an idiot. No, beautiful, he doesn't think like that at all but we might think you're an idiot if you turn down his little present. Well then... Who can say no? Hey, that was some ride. I couldn't tell if I was coming or going. You were coming all right. Ok, let's go. This way, it's over here. - Come on. - Yeah, come on. Hey, don't think I'm too drunk to get it up again. Course not sweetheart, prove it to me. Where's the bar? I can't find the bar. - Here. - Ah, have another drink. Just one more, huh? Just a little one, a little one! Sure... here, just a little one, huh? Oh, there you are, drink it all up. Hey! Look at your friend! Where you going? Hey, come back. Why did you go away? Come back here, I'm not finished yet Oh! Why, look who's here. Come on, we'd better hurry. Hey, who are you? You can't come in. We don't allow travelling salesmen. Or peddlers either. What about customers of the whores who live here? That's different. Eighth floor, letter 'A'. Who is it? A plumber! There's a leak in your bidet. It's flooding the whole house. Mr Feldman, what a surprise. I bet you're surprised. I wanted to thank you for the sleeping pills. - Mr Feldman, you've got it all wrong. - Shall we close the door? Inside! Move! We're gonna have a little talk and you'd better not hold anything back, either, otherwise I'm gonna be very angry. We'll tell you everything we know, Mr Feldman. - Who hired you to take my pictures? - Emilio. Are you sure? Well, that's what he called himself. Anyway, we haven't been paid yet. Describe him to me. - Very tall... - Handsome, elegant. - And dark eyes, brown hair. - And a real charmer. How did he give you the job? Well, we knew him by sight because he came into the club every so often. He always spent a fortune there. The other night he invited us for a drink and we came back here later for a little session. He told us that you'd be sitting at the table reserved for you a couple of nights later. We were to give his message to you, then get you drunk and bring you over to the other house so we could take the pictures. Then we were to leave you after you'd passed out. He promised us $2,000 if we could arrange to deliver the developed negatives today at 12 noon to the Hotel Continental, and that's all. Where are the negatives? Well, the fact is that... I'm sorry for you but business is business. Would you rather have...? No thanks. Never smoke grass on the job. You're the strangest millionaire I've ever met in my life. - Have you met many millionaires? - A few. You're really great fucks, both of you. And now you're gonna do what I tell you. You're going to keep that date with Emilio, I'll give you some developed pictures, you get the dough from him, and then you're on your own. What time is it? Just 8.30. I want to talk to Mrs Feldman, I'm her husband. Hello gorgeous, I've got some pictures that might interest you. Negatives of your husband in bed with various chicks in very compromising positions. I'd like to meet you today. Where? Pen. 41, Acacia Avenue? A bar called 'La Guta'. Better show up, I'm sure you'll get a kick out of it. I'll tell you when I see you. How will I recognise you? Black stockings, great. See you later, gorgeous. Say, are you really Harry Feldman? Well, of course not. My name is Al Crosby, I'm a private detective. Harry Feldman hired me to take his place because he knew it was a trap. But he made one mistake, he didn't tell me everything and that's gonna cost him plenty, the son of a bitch. Was that your last one? Sorry, but we've run out of cigarettes. After you left, a broad with transparent panties and expensive perfume... came into the house and tried to kill me. I thought she was a friend of yours. We're not murderers! Only hookers. Really great ones. Goodbye and good luck. Hey, wait a minute... If those pictures you gave us aren't of the real Harry Feldman no one will give us a penny for them. Look, angel, I'm not a genius but in this business I know more than you cos Emilio's gonna believe that they're of Feldman and the broad who tried to kill me also will believe they're of Feldman. - He'll pay all right. - You know her? You jealous? Go on, move. I'm not through here yet. What's on your mind? I'm off today, know how to play chess? No, I don't. Well then... I'd better give you a few lessons. You bastard! I was hoping it was me you wanted to screw. Yes. Sure, thanks. Whad'ya know? That bitch pussy wants to see me. Are you gonna pay her? Sure, and with interest. Come in. Nice? They're real educational, huh? And my two thousand? - Are you in a big hurry? - Um... Depends... And what would you do with that much dough? Give it to charity. Terrific idea. And stick to girls. I've had enough of all you men. Take your clothes off. If you like. Want me to tell you a fairy tale? Go down on it. I'm not sure you're ready for it yet. Haste makes waste. You bastard! Don't think I'm gonna lower the price for a little nookie. Stop. Don't stop, go on. Hey, can I offer you something? No thanks. Think I must have come in the wrong door. Salvation Army is just around the corner. Thanks. I could sure use some help now. Say, haven't you got a date with a lady? Yeah, but I don't see any ladies here. Very funny. Your lady's waiting inside. - Want something to drink? - Same as the lady. You know what it is? If you're drinking it, it must be very good. I never knew blackmailers were so sophisticated. Why don't you cut the bullshit and get down to business, huh? - A bit too strong for me. - You got the pictures? The negatives. I hope that they're better than these. As a pornographer you haven't much of a future. I was surprised when I saw you in the photographs. Great cock, huh? A bit better than the actor I was hoping to find in those pictures. Where is Harry? He's on a hike with some boy scouts. And he asked you to keep his appointment with Emilio? That's right. Now look Mr Ass-hole, I'm looking for my husband so you'd better tell me everything you know. Ok, nothing yet but I will soon. But I want you to tell me first why you concocted this whole beautiful set up for Harry? First these porno pictures and then his murder! Are you accusing me of planning murder? I've got a good sense of smell. The broad who tried to kill me used expensive perfume. Guerlain right? Mitsouko? Chamade. Are you still wearing transparent panties? I always wear them. Exhibitionist. It pays to advertise. Yes. Back to Mr Feldman. Why would you want to kill your husband? I'm sure it's not the dough, you're the millionairess and it's not jealousy because you're not living together so what gives? Now look nosey, tell me where Harry is. You'll get a bonus from me. - How many zeroes? - Three. Not enough, darling, you'll give me more, you'll see. Every masturbator's dream. Where is Harry? Please... let me go... Let me go, I tell ya! Please! Where is Harry? In Coco's house, San Diego. Who? Harry's mistress. He's been screwing her for years. The address. Three... three Ray... Raymondo Avenue. It's the truth. If you're lying I'll kill you. What are we supposed to do with him? Keep him in the shit-house. He'll be at home there. - Alive? - Yeah, I might need him again. - What do you want? - I'm a friend of Emilio. I've got a tourist in my taxi who's got plenty of dough, he wants to screw those two dykes. I'll go get them. Be back in a minute. Hey, what are they doing to those broads? Are they coming? I hope so, but the way those girls were screaming sure gave me the shivers. They always scream when they're making love. Oh yeah, that's funny, with me the broads usually start crying. Pay the taxi, we'll take your car. - How much? - Give him a tip. - There you are. - Thanks, real generous. We're going to San Diego, we have to save Harry Feldman. That's the house. Check it out. I'll go in alone. Harry Feldman is a very peculiar guy. Mr Feldman? Mr Feldman? If you make a move I'll shoot your balls off. Hands up, you bastard! Now turn around. Slowly. Ow! You son of a bitch! Come on! When did it happen? Harry and I were having a little fun and... then we heard a car pull into the driveway. He went to the window and they shot him from the car. When was that? Only a few seconds before you got here. I ran over to the window but I didn't see anyone. Poor Harry... Harry. - Harry... - He was such a nice guy. Please, Harry, don't die, please. Who's gonna pay me the $300 you still owe me. Did he have any other clothes? Harry's wallet! It must be in his jacket. Shit, there's no wallet. Somebody must have grabbed it. Makes us look like real ass holes. - Do you think it was her? - Possibility. And I hate looking like an ass hole. Did you swipe it? Oh! What makes you think I'd swipe anything from him? I believe in murder for dough. I liked Harry. He was good to me so what reason would I have to murder him? Do you remember that night in Atlantic City? - Atlantic City? - Yeah. I just bet my last $10 at the casino and won $300. Then we went up to my hotel room for a quick fuck and then I went to the John and when I came out you'd high-tailed out with my dough. I don't screw anyone for nothing so let go of me and piss off! Hey, you! Take those off or I'll shove 'em up your ass. Look, sweetheart, you're in no position to make threats. You're coming with us. First tell this bitch to take her hands off me. Let her go. Where the hell are we going? You'll find out soon enough but you'd better dress up first. Oh, I'll wear anything you like. How about a mink coat or would you rather I wear Persian lamb? Cut out the bullshit and get dressed. And give them something to wear too, OK? We'd better get outta here before the police haul us in. Thanks, Emilio, you're fantastic. - And here's your share. - No, you keep it all. Look, I appreciate what you did for me. You deserve a little reward. Want me to leave you alone? No, stay with me, you're really wonderful. I never thought I could find a man like you. Who'd be willing to kill three times for me. Without ever asking a single question. There aren't any obstacles between us. My darling. We have to be very careful for a couple of months yet. Then we'll leave the country. I wanna marry you. Make love to you every night. You'll have me all you want very soon. I love you. I love you too, darling. No man has ever excited me the way you do. And I want you too. Look, darling. Isn't it interesting? It sure is. It's the key to everything. One day, I'll explain. I'll never understand you. You're a strange woman. There are things I can't tell you yet. Things I haven't told anybody. One day though. After we're married. I promise I'll tell you everything. I'll never ask more than you're willing to tell me. Please, be patient. Just a little while longer, then we'll be free to do whatever we please. Connect me with the police. At number three Raymondo Avenue, in San Diego... You'll find the body of millionaire Harry Feldman. He was murdered. The crime was committed by two girls who were blackmailing this guy. There names are Bijou and Suzy. They also do a sex act in a porno club in town. You're a genius. That's why you got me to contact those two broads. Those bitches are just the type the police love to feed on. They're unimportant. The only thing that matters is the two of us. - I want you now. - No, no. I can't do it with you yet, my darling. I love to feel you and caress you. You know you're really some bitch, Coco. I didn't know whether to thank you for getting me involved in this mess or to curse you for it. Harry wanted a private detective without scruples and as smart as Humphrey Bogart so, of course, I thought of you. Thanks. Never thought we'd end up in the shit like this. Harry was a real nice guy, he even loved that bitch of a wife. And in the end he left her everything he had. Except the money was all hers. She's the only daughter of the King of platinum or some other precious metal like that. Only daughter? But that's not so. Harry told me his wife had a brother somewhere. He was even a twin brother. Yeah, that's right. His wife's got a twin brother. Are you sure? Yeah, he died after his father in some kind of an accident. I don't know what that guy's doing here but I don't like it. Smells like trouble. Excuse me. - If it isn't the great Alfred Crosby. - Hello, Benny. You want a drink? Ah, no thanks, I'm on duty tonight. Gives me a chance to run up my expense account. Well, if there's nothing I can do for you, I think I'll continue talking to the young lady. Sorry to interrupt. Say, do you know these two chicks? Never saw them in my life. Go to the car. And you, sweetheart, do you know them? I think I recognise them. I've seen them somewhere. They're cheerleaders for a pop group. - We've got to split. - We haven't been paid yet. - What's the matter? - I'll tell you later. Come on, let's get outta here. Where the hell are we going? I'd like to know myself. Why the fuck did we get mixed up in this? It's no use complaining now, angel. If you're nice maybe I'll sell you to a white slave trader. Or better yet, to a rich Arab. Three chicks, huh? Yeah, it's always been my lucky number. - Shall I repaint the license number? - Don't bother, it's fake anyway. This way. - What'll you have? - Champagne, what else? I want to see Miss Felicia. I'm Al Crosby. Miss Felicia's busy now. I'll wait, I'm in no hurry. I don't know how to reach her. Try the telephone. Tell him it's for Felicia. A guy, Al Crosby, wants to see her. OK. Miss Felicia apologises, she'll see you right away. Thanks a lot but, er... can I leave my friends here without them getting mugged or raped. Look here, this is a very respectable establishment. Give them anything they want. See you later. See you later. Come in, Al. Come in. You forgot your g-string. So what, you've seen it before. Friendly as ever. You drink poison too? And you? Are you still a son of a bitch? And I'm just the kind of a guy you go for. You taste of cigarette smoke and lousy whisky. And you also remind me of the worst times of my life. I thought you were busy? When I heard it was you I told the waiter to put a stiff dose of cyanide in your champagne. Just what do you want? Protection for me and the chicks. - You got any dough? - Yeah. - How much? - Three bucks. You lousy bastard. You're broke and you ordered champagne. C'mon, I always had expensive tastes. Good evening. How did she get here? I thought you'd enjoy a little surprise. You know, Al, baby... everyone has fun here at Miss Felicia's. I own this cat-house. And three massage parlours too. And a topless club. So now you know everything, ass hole! I wouldn't have let you in here. Mrs Feldman told me to be nice to you. Where are the chicks? - You always worry about your whores? - Yeah. That other night, when you locked yourself in with me. And beat me until I gave you the names of my best paying clients. Those two bastards who raped that girl in your house... but the cops didn't bother you for it, you remember? I kept you out of it. You bet that I remember it. I won't ever forget. Why don't we forget our old differences. Let's just think of the future. We could pack you up in a nice box and ship you off to the police. I'll tell the truth, that you murdered your husband. Who'd believe you? What would be my motive? We'd also make sure you'd shut your mouth, you and your girlfriends. We have no sense of humour. Yes, so I've found out. Looks like every time I come across you I get screwed and I mean screwed. You ought to work with us. I've got a little job you can handle. There's a guy in town who's annoying me. Seems there are a lot of us. Yeah, but this one is dangerous and you're not And if you and your chicks set the guy up for me, I promise I won't hurt you, I'll give you some money and a ticket to Mexico. Now, doesn't that sound like a pretty good deal? How much? $50,000 each. Who is he? The judge, Marcus. You see, the judge has a weakness for prostitutes. You bring him over to our place and get him stoned. You split and leave all of this to me. And what if you don't keep your promise? I always keep my promises. You're a real heartless bitch without any scruples. Sure, I'm a bitch. Only I've got my reasons. Why don't you tell me what they are? Might help me a little to ease my conscience. I'm sure you don't know what conscience means. You bet I do, sweetheart! I've got my own interpretation of scruples and conscience, not your version. And it's not the police version of scruples either. Only I never hurt anybody in my life who wasn't a real bastard. Course my own sister might not be the conventional one but neither is yours. Bitch! Come on... Come with me. I think I'd better tell you the whole story. The best way to gain my confidence is to trust me. There was once a couple of twins: Sister and brother. They'd inherited an immense fortune. Their father was the king of wolframite during the second world war. The son... was a homosexual. He was unable to hide it from the family. And was disinherited by his father. So he went to Paris and worked as a transvestite. The millionaire travelled around with his daughter, Carla. - You? - No. Wait. Accompanying them was the usual entourage of a millionaire, a secretary, Feldman, his lawyer, Marcus, and his secretary, Maria Kramer. Remember her? Yeah, sure. She turned up in her car at the bottom of a lake. The judge called it suicide and the family was unable to get the cops to reopen the case. There was a fourth person. The daughter's boyfriend. Alphonse Bubé. Who died a few months later under mysterious circumstances. The judge called it suicide. Exactly. In Paris, the millionaire and his daughter... crashed into a tree and both were killed instantly. And so ended the gold mine for the poor parasites. Then they thought up a diabolical plan. They set fire to the car carbonising the two bodies. They declared that inside the car... were the bodies of the millionaire and his disinherited son. After that, Harry Feldman... then found... the son, Robert, the homosexual... and paid for him to have a sex change operation... and introduced him as Carla, the dead sister. No one suspected anything. Feldman preserved Robert's penis in alcohol. Before the operation he took a picture. A transparency... in an apartment where he hid Robert. The poor parasites wanted to make sure... they had Robert under their thumbs. But that's absurd, not even a prick in alcohol or a picture proves that. Robert had on his penis a very strange birthmark. So it was easy to identify Robert's penis. That's nice. Poor Robert didn't have a good time in Paris. It was horrible. I had to become a prostitute in order to survive. I get it now. Feldman married the phoney Carla. Thanks to the millions of the father, found their gold mine again, divided the fortune. They became very successful. He cut the picture in four and each had a section. And the prick in the bottle? Every year one of them is responsible for looking after it. Robert/Carla accepted their game and saw himself getting robbed more and more every year. And for five years he lived that life of deception. He couldn't seem to free himself from those sharks. One day... Emilio appeared. A crude man. A gangster. But she fell desperately in love with him. With Emilio she regained her confidence. He helped her to get away from Feldman. He developed her business into a chain of... brothels, topless bars and massage parlours. And Carla decided to stop the blackmailing. Helped by Emilio. And... and now you know everything. Does Emilio know about the sex change? No and he mustn't know. I'll only tell him when I feel totally free. We haven't even made love yet in a normal way. But, if you can tell me... Well, it may seem very foolish to you... but until I've recovered all the pictures and the penis... I won't feel a woman. And to make love is impossible. The only one left is judge Marcus. He's the one guarding the bottle this year. And he has the fourth section of the picture. According to your personal view of justice and honour, do you think it would be simple and criminal... to help me get rid of that rat? I guess it wouldn't. I'll help you get rid of him with no regrets. But we have to convince the girls too. I'll leave that to your ingenuity. And now you can join the girls, I'm sure they miss you. Bijou, what have they done to you? Oh, nothing, nothing. Everything's cool, real cool. They just gave us a little drink, it tasted delicious. But what a kick! We started to get drowsier and drowsier and all of a sudden we went out like a light. Puff... And we woke up here. They didn't torture you or beat you? Tortured us? Are you crazy? Yeah, very nice. Well that's good, I was worried about you. Why don't you take your clothes off? Now, hold it! There's something I've gotta tell you. We're all prisoners in here and... - Will you listen? Look... - As long as we're together what does it matter? - Easy, easy! - Let's see what you got there. This is serious. - We've gotta get out of here. - Look at this! Cut that out! Let go will ya? For Pete's sake. - Here it is! - Come on. Wait a minute. Let me kiss him! I've found him. Arrange for Al to pick him up tomorrow at 'Flossy's' Thank you. No, my darling... Please. Do it with her. I am judge Charles Theodore Marcus. I wish to leave an accurate account of the events that took place in Paris... on September 10th, 1974. When I discovered in a bar in the Place Begal, the young Robert Bressac, the son of Edmund Bressac, who's lawyer I was at the time. And who entrusted me with all his private affairs. The reason for this confession is that those who took part with me in these events have died in the course of one year. And I'm convinced they were victims of a conspiracy... that was organised by the very same Robert Bressac. And... and that my life is in danger. - I said I didn't want to be disturbed. - Oh, I'm very sorry Mr Marcus. I didn't think you were here. I thought you had a date at 'Flossy's'. Of course, thank you. This declaration will be given promptly to the police... if I disappear suddenly or in the event of accidental death, or murder. As I was saying: On September 10th, 1974... I was in Paris making the necessary preparations for Mr Bressac's arrival. This is the life. Suzy, darling, you ought to take another swim. OK. - Can I help you? - Whisky. - Oh, please? - Yes, sir? Do you know a certain Emilio? Yes, sir. He comes here often. Do you think he'll be here today? Most likely, sir. He's a very good customer. All right, there he is. If we miss each other, we'll meet at the airport. All right. I bet he's got a two inch cock. Do you know those two young ladies? I sure do, sir. They're a couple of prostitutes. The boss keeps kicking them out. All right, pay up and get out. We don't allow... They're my guests, waiter. I mean, if they allow me to sit at their table. Well, girls? Sure, you look like a gentleman. And thank you for your invitation, very generous of you. My name is Smith. And yours? It went OK? Yeah, perfect. Come on, let's go. I don't want to think of what they're going to do to him. He's a rat. Rat or not, I was just screwing the guy. C'mon. You'd better get to the airport. And you? Well, me... I'll see you around. What'll we do? You'll go on fucking your brains out. It was as easy as falling off a log. Come here. Let's see it. Here. Look. You see I was Robert Bressac. Now you know everything. I never meant to hide it from you, only I was afraid you wouldn't understand. If you prefer... we can destroy the last traces of Robert. And I'll be completely yours forever but as... Carla Bressac. This declaration will be given promptly to the police... if I disappear suddenly, in the event of accidental death, or murder. Subtitles by suckmysound cinemageddon 2017
