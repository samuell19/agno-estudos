Yeah! Hello? Just a moment. For you, Tom. Who? Me? - Forget about it. Let's play. - Okay. Come on. Come on. Hello. This is Tom. You know, a man and a woman were killed five days ago. The killer was a colored guy and his name was Tom Twain. MACHIKO YASHIRO SHUNJI KASUGA RYŪJI OKI KEN SUDO EIJIRŌ YANAGI SEIICHIRŌ KAMESHI AKIRA KUJI MITSUO ANDŌ ROBERT DUNHAM RAVEN SHELTON SID TAYLOR Hello? Huh? What? Yeah. Okay. I'll go. Do we have to go anyway? They know all about us, so we have to go. It can't be helped. Who was the man on the telephone? Japanese or American? DIRECTED BY KINJI FUKASAKU This looks like the place. I'm John Kennedy. I got a phone call today. This is the place, isn't it? I'm Kennedy. What'd you call me for? Who are you? You spoke good English on the phone. You're mistaken. I got a phone call too. I was told to go get ready for the trip. Looks like you guys too had a reason why you couldn't say no. So it was the owner of this place who called? - I don't know. - Whose house is this? I don't know that either. Well, we'll probably find out when the appointed seven o'clock comes. Ladies and gentlemen. Sit down, please. I told you to sit down! Well, why don't you introduce yourself? I am Miyahara. This is my girl. This is one of my men. Won't you sit down? There isn't any poison in it. I don't drink. Let's hear what you have to say now. We're still missing one of the players. But anyway, let me introduce you. In a nutshell, you three are human scum! Masao Kanayama a.k.a. Kinsei Kou. He may look like a coward, but he is a man who has carefully done bad things. A spy for two sides of Korea, North and South! He is a dirty rat who sneaked into Japan when the revolution happened! I'm sure South Korea will be very happy to know about you. Sit down. The man in front of him is John Kennedy. He is a good American citizen willing to do whatever it takes to get money. He was discharged for selling his men's guns to the Japanese yakuza. He returned to his home country but didn't earn much as a businessman. Besides, his luxury-loving wife wasn't satisfied. So they came here again, trying to exploit Japan. But now he's wanted by the OSI. - Is that right, Kennedy? - Shut up! This young man likes killing very much. Before you pull the trigger, you will be dead. You Jap! You can do nothing. Have a drink, Kennedy. So what do you want us to do? You want money? Just the opposite. I want to give it to you. By the way, I'm offering a big job to earn $500,000. $500,000 is 200 million Japanese yen. Are you going to rob a bank or something? As expected of Koreans. You have good instincts. No wonder Japanese fishing boats are caught on the Rhee Line. There's a bank in Tokyo that does the accounting for the US military. And every Thursday they send a vehicle to deliver cash to the base. With enough people, we can surely get it. Are you sure? We're talking about $500,000! It's worth a try, even if it's risky! You don't have to answer right away. Take your time and think about it. What if I refuse? If you give it a little thought, you shouldn't be able to refuse my offer. Even among the crooks, you're the greediest of them all. How could you turn down such a good offer? The players are now all in place. Okay, everybody, put 'em up! You heard me, put 'em up! Don't you get excited. Take it easy. Allow me to introduce your colleague: Tom Twain. He gets so crazy when he sees a woman that he loses all control. The other day he attacked a couple in the base park and caused a huge incident. I guess he has too much strength. Did you telephone me? The man you killed is a relative of a gangster named Shibayama. If I slip up… they're going to put holes in you. Give me your gun. Give me! Okay. The team is now all here. Sit down again. Hey, wait a minute, Miyahara! I don't like this guy. I'm not gonna work with any Sambo. You poor white trash! You can't talk to me like that! You know you're not in your hometown now, Kennedy. Okay, come on, Sambo! That's enough! I didn't call you here to watch you fight! The most important thing right now is to make some money. Okay? How about it, Kennedy? Okay. Okay, Tom? I'll hear your answers in the morning. Those at the breakfast table are deemed to have said "OK". If it's a "no", get out of here tonight. However… In that case, I can't guarantee your life. You've gathered a bunch of terrible pigs. I'm a moral person. Are you going to say that it's not a crime if we get rid of them all when we're done with our work? Good insight. We'll order around white, black, and yellow and take foreign money. It doesn't matter much who dies. Who among the post-war Japanese has had such a wonderful idea? Anyway, starting tonight I become the keeper of the pigsty. I think that's the most suitable job for you. Or do you want to be a pig slaughterer? Either way, I'm a moral man. A half a million dollars. A pretty good amount of money. Yeah, but you have to risk your life for it. But what a thrill. Oh, sure, if they're all Americans. But not this time. A nigger, a Korean, and the boss is a Jap. A Jap who can do karate. Well, in 1944, on Saipan, I-- Defeated the whole Japanese army. I wonder just how many times you've repeated it. Why don't you tell me about some new heroic episode? Just for a change, show me money, not medals. No. No! Looks like you're all okay with this. Apparently it's okay, but will things work? How would we split the money, for example? You can't divide $500,000 among seven people. I'm the chief and the planner. I get $300,000 of the $500,000. Split the remaining $200,000 among the six of you. That's $50,000 each. Don't Japanese elementary schools teach math? I've never heard of 6 multiplied by 5 being 20. That's a calculation you can't do in elementary school math. Two out of six die. So the remaining four split the $200,000. So that's $50,000. Okay? Welcome. - Where's Mr. Cho? - Oh, upstairs. Please come in. Hey. Mr. Cho told me you were coming. Sit down. Mr. Cho isn't here? Ah, never mind that. Sit down. I'd like to ask you a few questions. You're a persistent one. I don't know any darky who killed her brother, no matter how many times you ask. No. We don't need to talk about her brother. - Well, then. - Hey, wait. I heard you're going to borrow some money from Cho. I hear it's a lot of money, but what are you up to? It's not the kind of thing you'd get on board with. - I'm going to start a pig farm. - Pig farm? I'm going to raise pigs. I see. Pigs, you say? Well, anyway. Mr. Cho says you're up to something now. I'll keep my eye on you, too. Mr. Cho went elsewhere for urgent business. Go with her. And I wish you the best of luck. Thank you. Thank you for your patience. I didn't expect to be here. I'm a very busy person, as you know. Well, do you have any idea who killed your brother? We got a brief from the military a little while ago that a woman-crazed darky had escaped. Hmm... Well, I'm after that darky. But Mr. Cho, it was bad that you spoke to a pesky mite like Shibayama. Don't worry. You and Shibayama are both colleagues, so to speak. I think Japanese people lack the spirit of cooperation. Ah. Thanks. Here's the rent for the vacation home. You can buy the goods you want now at the store I run. But you won't find anything as prehistoric as a dagger. No thanks. The things I want to buy are Colt and Ruger. But if I buy from your store, this money goes back into your pocket again. Money doesn't go around the world, it goes around the rich, so there's nothing you can do about it. But I wish you success in your business. If you want money, you have to commit a crime. That's the best way. Moralist is a profession for people without money. Neither of us want to be moralists. See you. - Let's go. - Okay. NEW YORK CITY BANK 10:00 AM With a wife that beautiful, I'd be worried. Tom is indiscriminate about women. The car leaves the bank at ten o'clock and goes to this two-way road at 12:40. Traffic is roughly one car every five minutes. That's around three minutes of work anyway. We need someone to chase the vehicle, someone to watch the two-way road, and someone to wait at the site of the raid. Anyway, the seven of us will do these three jobs separately. The key here, though, is teamwork. Yeah. But there's one joker in this room who doesn't want to work with me. Or there's a certain woman in this room who has an interest in me. Why don't you shut up? What do you think you're doing? Brother, if this continues, we're going to fall apart. He's always the one causing all the trouble! So the kid needs a toy. Welcome. Brother, which one do you want? - They're all you got? - Pretty much. - Let's take that one. - What? That mulatto. That won't be enough. Aren't you having her clean because she can't get any customers? This is more than enough. That girl is an odd one of ours. I guess milk coffee has a more complex taste than straight coffee. Sabu. Hey, get ready. You're gonna be a bride. Hey, what's up? That girl only has that one outfit. Really? Brother, what are you going to do? Peel it off. No! No! No! What do you want? Tom, this is your bride. Take good care of her. They look like a well-matched couple. Get out! Get out of here! How old are you? When did you begin this sort of thing? Where's your father?! I don't know English. Put your clothes on. Looks like the drugs are working. Now the house will be quiet. I don't think so. That's going to complicate the division again. What kind of math will the leader do? The math's still the same. I just used a rag as a rag. What are you looking at? Why didn't you sleep with me? I am fond of drinking and gambling. I'd have done anything to get a woman. But somehow I couldn't touch you. I don't know why. I don't know English. Oh. But you're our sister. What's your name? Hanako. What about you? Tom. Tom Twain. Tom… You're…a good man. Oh... No. No. Don't move! I see. Are these your pigs? What the hell is this? I'm here to get a black pig. That's a shame. The pig farm is under construction. You don't quite understand, do you? I mean the guy who killed my brother-in-law. I told you I don't know anybody like that. So you're gonna cover for him? Who is he? You bought a mulatto that suits the darky two or three days ago, didn't you? And you still say he's not here? No, he's not here. Let him go. This is for Tom. Are you fishing for even more money? Or are you saying you don't want to sell him? I've said it a million times. I don't have anything to sell. Then I'll make a deal with you guys. Any of you. Sell the black pig! I'll pay generously. So? What do you wanna do? Lose a half million dollars for a few peanuts? Kennedy! What are you talking about? Everyone, put away your guns. If Tom isn't here, then we're done. If he is, you guys are really impressive. I'll leave for today. I'm sure I'll find him someday anyway. Are you sure you want to leave it like that? Don't be rash. We're going to get Tom and a few extras. Okay? The vehicle with the money travels along this road to the base. Tom, you and I are going to follow the vehicle from Tokyo. And Kanayama and Hanako will stay here. Give me the photo. The visibility will be low there. You should carefully compare the terrain with the photos. All right. Got it. All right. Let's go to the next location. Stop the car at this three-way intersection. The one who stops it must be a beautiful woman. Especially blonde. When the vehicle stops, Tom, Kennedy, now it's your turn. We're all going to act then. All right? There's no time for fooling around! Either you'll be covered in blood, or you get 500,000 dollars. This is the decisive battleground. You should be able to walk it with your eyes closed. You could get two eyeballs busted out, you know. Let's go! The three women will take the money and carry it back here. The men should disperse the police if you're chased. The most important thing is to follow the plan. And then leave no evidence. Leave whoever dies in the field and withdraw. We had no connection before. So you don't have to worry about it being traced back to you. However, if anyone is too injured to get in the car you will die by our hands. And when you get beat up, can I assume that's what will happen to you? I'm never going to die. Okay? One little mistake and all your hard work will be wiped out. Tomorrow this room is going to be stacked with half a million dollars. Look forward to it, and sleep tight tonight, everyone. You look happy. Is everyone asleep yet? They must have gone to bed. Tomorrow you three women are supposed to carry the money. What if there's an accident on the way? Hanako is a fool. Even Ann isn't a difficult opponent for you. That sounds like something you'd think of. You're saying you didn't think about it? After you take care of them both, take the money and go to Yokohama. Go to the usual place. What if I run away with it? I'll find you, I promise. And then you're going to kill me. I don't die easily. I'm not so easy to kill either. You're driving down a mountain road in the rain. You don't know what kind of accident you'll have. This is a job you can never do again once you fail. Well, you won't catch me stickin' around this pig house much longer. If you're a pig and don't like the pig house, get the hell out. No one will stop you. You seem to be the most frustrated of all. What?! I have been waiting for years. I'm used to waiting. Anyway, we're calling it off for today. Oh. It's raining like hell. Are you glad it's raining? But you want to get out of here, don't you? Which is it? What about you, Tom? I don't know. If I had the money, I could go anywhere. I could buy anything. We would be happy. But if I take the money, they'll all dump me. They'll try to kill me with a sword. Miyahara will sell me to Shibayama. Everybody wants lots of money. One pair. Ha! Full house! Hey, you. Hai. Okay. May I have a cigarette, please? Certainly. Aren't you going to light it? Come closer. Then I will light it. What do you want? What do you think? Well, if I'm correct... This. After this job is over… After it's over? Kill him. Who? John Kennedy. I see. So you don't care what you do because they're pigs you're gonna kill anyway? Wait. Where do you think you're going? Don't be shy. Please take your time. What did she say? She said… you're a pretty charming white pig. I call. Four sevens. I thought the bad guys in Japan are supposed to be good at games. Have you seen Ann? I don't know. - Damn it. - Oh, wait a minute. She wasn't upstairs. Do you still have to look for Ann? You need to get a grip. Do you know what Miyahara will do once we take the money? What do you mean? He's going to kill Tom, Saburo, and Kanayama and keep it all to himself. Yeah. I think so… What about Ann being a conspirator? I will run away after I take the money. Get rid of Miyahara. You need to decide where we're going to meet. Even you guys like white flowers? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! Here! - Come on, come on, come on! - No! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Hey, you're pretty cute for being black! Let's be friends! Idiot! Aren't you a whore anyway? Tom! Tom! Dirty rat! You wanna fight, pig? Son of a bitch! Pause! Hey, stop it! Stop! Sabu! Stop it, Tom! Tom! That's enough! The job gets delayed just once and you do this? I'll never let anyone touch Hanako! Anyone who touch her will die! I'll kill him! She's different from all of you! Hanako's no longer a prostitute! Idiot. Just because we're a little corrupt doesn't mean we can be compared to that whore Hanako. But they are the best of us. Yeah. The men here are not going to kill for a woman. I don't know, maybe they will for money. This rain is going to continue for some time. I wonder if they're really going to attack the transport truck. I've been watching them the whole time. No doubt about it. I mean, it's a mountain road, but still, it leads to the base. I don't think you can have a flashy shootout. I will surely avenge your brother. And I'll take the money. My horoscope is good today. It says it's a lucky day for money. What month were you born in, brother? - December. - December? You aren't so lucky. "You should avoid driving." They say it's the day you need a monk and an undertaker. Watch out. That's dynamite right there at your feet. Brother, let me have a shot. Don't get too close. It's a one-way street anyway. It's okay if you can't see it. Call them. This is No. 1. Just passed the whisky sign. You'll see it soon. Okay. We'll make it work. Hanako! Come on, come on. Wait! You're slow! Not so fast! Come on! Are you ready? Are you ready? What's up, No. 2? Answer me! - Should we take a break? - Go, go! - Wait! - Come on! Go! Go! Ready. Hey! CAUTION ROAD CONSTRUCTION AHEAD DETOUR This is No. 2. Here comes the car. No. 3. Copy that. They must be used to road construction in Japan. Hey. What happened? What's the matter with you? Can't you understand? Hey, hey. What's wrong on this road? What? What's going on here? You say turn to right? Hey! What the hell are you doing? Stop messing about! Okay, okay. Take it easy. Let's go, boys. Hurry! Hurry! Hey, take it easy. This is a bad road, man. Okay? Oh, don't worry. That's okay. - Hey, where you going? - Hey, what's the matter here? - What kind of a road's this? - What're you doin' on this road? - Please slow down! - Slow down! You shouldn't be on this road! What kind of driver you got behind that wheel, anyway? - Take it easy! Be careful! - Hey, slow down there! - Who do you think you are, anyway? - Hey, take it easy! - Shut up! - Hey, Look! Hey, something wrong? Can you help me? Well. What trouble, ma'am? Something's wrong with my car. Where? Hey! Take the back! Get out! Brother, start the car! Something's wrong. Let's turn back! Here. Hey, back up! - Let's do it. - Okay. Get out! Or you'll be burned up! Okay, don't shoot! We're coming out! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Hey! Let's hurry! - Cops? - No, cops don't have guns like that. Brother! That's a rifle! Damn it. It's Shibayama. That damn mite. Kanayama! Hurry! Hurry! Let's go! Let's go! Cover me! Get the hell out of here! Damn it! Wait! Where's Tom? Tom! Where are you-- Because of that damn Tom, Ann got-- What the hell is Tom up to? I don't know. But now we're down two, just like you said. What are you going to do? I'm going to need you to come clean. Where did you and Aki agree to meet up? What? Don't get any ideas. Don't play games with me! Aki is your girl. If you two conspire together, you can run away with the money! You're the one who ordered the women to bring the money in the first place! I see. So you tried to get into the women's car at the scene of the attack. You can imagine all you want, but don't wave your pistol in my face! You're giving orders? You're not a leader because you don't have $500,000! I'll step dow whenever you want. Shut up! Japanese people can't be trusted! I know that personally! Give me the gun! Take it. If you can. The bastard tried to make off with $500,000 with Aki. I caught him trying to drive away, and he pointed a pistol at me. Did you get the location of the rendezvous with Aki? No. - You idiot! Why not? - Even if he had... ...do you think Aki would wait there for Kennedy? That bitch. You can't buy anything in Japan with that money. I know someone who can convert dollars to yen for you. So let's bring Tom in and we'll split it among the three of us. Okay? You don't have to think so much about it. It's a win for all three of us, right? Tom seems to really like you. After Saburo tried to mess with you, I remember Miyahara telling me that you and Tom are the only decent ones. Hey. Why don't you say something? Don't just be silent! If you move, I'll shoot you. Can you shoot a pistol? I can shoot. If you can shoot it, try it. See, I can do it. Do you want me to shoot it again? You guys are very stupid. You must have thought you left Tom behind until now. But look at this. Looks like you guys have been had by that black pig. So you've been had by a guy you've been underestimating. Even that mulatto is not an idiot. You're a blundering pig-owner, aren't you? I see. Give me a light, would you? Drop the gun. I'm sorry about what happened, but Shibayama, I can let bygones be bygones. What do you think? So you want to team up with my husband and split 500,000 dollars. Fifty-fifty. You're asking too much. I thought you were already left out. But I have information. Right. He's pissed off that Miyahara is toying with him so I think he might be okay with it. I'll go get him. She doesn't have a single relative? Then what about Hanako's friends? - Who are her friends? - Wait. I'll give a lot of money to anyone who tells me anything. Are you guys covering for Hanako? I hope you cut us some slack. Why should we defend her? Where did you buy Hanako from? I took her in because her mother died. Her mother was a whore then? Where? At a campground in Kagamihara. Kagamihara, you say? What do you got? It's a US military training area. But they completely abandoned the place and now it's an empty town. That's about where Hanako could go. Blossom. Yeah. Blossom. Wind blows. And cornstalks sway like waves. Car runs this way. It's John's car. Full of milk cans. It's an old one, but he sure is proud of that Packard engine. I drink his milk and he never fails to leave until I say "Good". The sun begin to rise and birds take to the wing. I breathe profoundly. And then my work begin. Got it? Oh... My farm. The story of my farm. Where is your farm, Tom? America? Oh, no. But it's out there somewhere. And if we go to the farm, we both will be happy. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's Tom. Hanako! - Tom! - Okay! Sabu! Hey, go check it out. Wait! They're in the middle of a killing game. Whoever wins gets the money. We'd better wait until it's over. Until then, we'll just have to wait and see. It's Shibayama and his men. Your girl's there, too. What do we do? There are seven of them. We're going to take them out. With as many men as possible. Tom! I won't shoot. Just come out. We need to talk. No! I don't trust you! It's okay, Tom. Shibayama's just over there. Damn it! Tom, answer me! I don't want your money! I wanna leave with Hanako! Okay. I'll give you and Hanako $100,000. Take the money and run anywhere you want. You and I are buddies. Okay. Are you sure? Can you trust Tom? Probably. He's better than you! You son of a bitch! I'm sorry about that. I was just testing him a bit. Sabu! Come out! It's a truce. Hey, show me the bullets you all have. That's not really enough. Okay. Don't worry. Sabu, right. Tom, left. Hey, you secure the rear. Hey! Quickly! - You hurt? - It's just a scratch. Don't worry about it. Hey, go that way. Tom! Tom! Tom! Hanako... Finally it's just the two of us. There's $500,000 in that car. What now? Whoever is left has the right to take it. What do you say? Shut up! Shut up! I don't want your money! I don't wanna kill no more! Hanako! Hanako! - Tom! - Hanako! Tom, I need your help. I'll give you $100,000 for your help. What are you going to do without money? If you stay in this place, it's like suicide. With $100,000 you could go anywhere. No! No! Okay. Don't worry. Tom. Okay. Okay, Tom. Okay. THE END
