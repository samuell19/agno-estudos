I'm really lost. - Why are you doing drugs? Why are you doing this stuff? I don't know. - I don't know. - You have to step away from it. We can do this together. SJ you're one of the most amazing, beautiful girls I've ever met. Cause you know how talented you are. Do you know how proud your mom would be of you? Get outta that contract.

But I want out. - You're taking, you're taking the piss. - She wants to terminate her contract. - I wasn't fucking talking to you. - Obviously, but I was standing up for my friend. - Fuck off. - This guy. - Sarah Jane. Don't you fucking forget yeah. I plucked you from obscurity. You were a little girl from the sticks. Now you're making big, serious money. Do you wanna up and leave? Doesn't work like that. - No, I told you from the start. I am a soul singer. I don't wanna be doing this shit. - Oh, you don't wanna do this shit no more, no? Let me remind you. We have a contract in place that states you can't just up and leave as and when you please, you fucking arrogant bitch. - You've never given me a copy. - Why should I? - Because the law says so. - Oh so does it. So you bring your fucking little lawyer friend in here to chat shit to me. - All right calm down okay. I don't wanna fight. I just need a civil agreement that says this didn't work. So we terminate. - Unfortunately for you. There's no clause in your agreement that allows that only I can do that. - Which I would know if you'd fucking let me read it. - Fucking read it. - Can you help me please? - I'm a gentle man. I'm a business man, yeah? And I've been in this fucking business for a long time. No one. And I mean, no one has ever terminated before I say so. - Yeah, yeah I understand that. - Good. - I'm not stupid. If there's anything that I can do, Russell, please let me know because I need out now. - It's not illegal, he's done his homework. - [Russell] You're whispering ladies Anything you'd like to share? - Sorry. - Oy! Fucking listen to me when I'm talking to you. - Okay, we have a gig tomorrow night don't we? - Yeah. The big one at The End. - All of it is yours. - You, you really want to fucking drop all of it. - Yeah. - No. - What do you mean, nah? - I want more. - All right and how's that gonna work? - Okay. So 65% of your funds from your previous gigs would be my backend from what I would've gotten in the next six months, yeah? So you pay your bag. - You can't do that. - Oh, but I can it's in the contract. Fucking check it. - Shit. - All right, fine, fine. - SJ are you sure? - Yeah. - Pleasure doing business with you, eh? now get the fuck out my office.

Because it's timeless and yeah, my time with Russell D was insane, but it reminded me that music isn't about money. But it is worth giving everything that I have. [humming] - You're gonna be great.
