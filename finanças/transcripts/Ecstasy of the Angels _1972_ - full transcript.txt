The crying swallow flies at dawn Ecstasy of the Angels The sun's radiance is also very sad. Even the sound of the wind... Pierces a stony heart. Ideal for a burning cheek, There's a frozen asphalt bed. I don't need a silver needle To mend a shredded flag. I will file my nails in the dark. This is our battle ground. A silent battle front. A crying swallow flies at dawn. In the streets at daybreak, Here's to success! Leaves flutter in the wind. I throw a tiny flame Towards bright crimson blood In any barren field. Burn the dawn! Burn the streets at dawn! This is a fire. Oh fire, this is... Our battle ground. This is a fire. Oh fire, this is... Our silent battle front. I can see it. The fire! Burning! I can see the flames burning it up. That is our fire. The flames we emit. The fire we emit is... October's fire. Fall's fire. Flowers, love, our history... We have our own struggle. We will fight our own battles. October, hold me tight. I want to know you. You are October and I am Fall. I want to know more about you. Even in bed, I'm October and you're Fall. That's the truth whatever we do. Hold me, October. Make love to Fall. If I overthrow Fall If I ruin you... What will I be then? Will I be Fall? Or the Year? Be quiet, Be quiet and hold me. Is that an order from Fall? Something decided by the Year? Or... I'm only asking you. Heavy... You are heavy, Fall. Good luck! OK! Good! Hurry up! Be quiet! Ok. Hurry up! The police? Monday, I'll get October. - I'll go! - No! - You go ahead. - OK. You OK, October? I can't see. Take command! OK. Wednesday! Dammit! What's the time? 3:10 Is this the place? This is it. No mistake. Where's the September Group? Ah! September's come. Fall... What? It's Fall. October, were you hit? What happened to September? They aren't coming. That's crazy! What're you saying, Fall? Saturday, put October in my car. Quickly! Hold it! Who's that there? Please hurry up! Saturday, let go of me! Get going! This ain't the deal, Fall! Burn, burn, burn! Since there's nothing we need to keep. Friday! I'm coming! OK! Eat and sleep... Let's go! Smash, smash, smash! Smash it! Destroy it all! A park bench! A stripper's poster! Everything in sight! Let's do it! Run, Friday! Commander! Who are you? You're October's Monday and Friday? I'm February ofthe Winter Army. February? Why has Winter mobilized? The Year's orders. Give us the explosives. October gives us orders from the Year. Not you. We're Fall's October. Fall's on hold. Winter's been mobilized. So give us the goods. Search the place! Nothing! Bastard! Where are they? Friday, we're not giving them up. They're Fall's weapons! Cut the crap! Fall's on hold. October's down. Down? That's a lie! October's not dead! October's down Fall's on hold. So February goes to work. Friday, where are they? Where are they? Stop it! Talk! Do opportunists need explosives? Who's an opportunist? They're our weapons, Friday! Our struggle! Those who make the struggle private are opportunists. They're our weapons! Friends died getting them! I'll never give them up! Just like the October group. But... We need those explosives. Spit it out, Friday! Where are they? Talk! Where! Where are they? Show us! Where? Show us! Where are they? I'd like a soldier like you. I, too, don't want to hurt you. Stop it! Where are they? Do you want to betray the Seasons? Huh, Monday? This is not something for Fall or Winter... but for the Year, the Four Seasons Society! Can't figure it out? Rape her until she talks. You... Talk! Monday, where are they? Do you plan to make them private property? Talk, Monday! Obey Army rules! You're a soldier! A Four Seasons soldier! Where are they? October Group's gone. Fall's on hold. We, Winter's February, have been mobilized. Got it, Monday? Friends' blood... The crimson blood of friends... ...has dyed my skin. We were together. We... we were together there, too. Together, we heard the roar... ...and saw the flames that'd burn the sun. We never fought each other until now. Friday... We're family... More than family. What are we to the Four Seasons? What are we? We are we. Are revolutionary soldiers... Four Season soldiers? We are... people who will build our own world. Our own world... Our history was that of building our own world. That's why... I'm Friday from October Group! February... Pull up the mats there. You'll find our weapons, the bounty of our struggle. February... How do you think you can... take up our fight? I understand your feelings. I've heard that one before. Well... then there's nothing to say. Our duty is to take the goods and destroy the target. That's it. That's my answer. Wait and see what we do with the goods. We'll wash October's blood with that of the System. Fuck off! We'll wipe our own ass... We'll wipe our own blood and lick our own wounds. and... That's the answer... We'll overthrow our own enemies. That's the deal. October... Monday! What? Let's go to October. We can only do it with him. Let's wait... Two days. Yes... October'll understand. Only the October Group can be trusted. In the end... In the end. You can't preach revolt if you can't lead our troops. What're you getting at, Winter? It's me. Fall. Don't deny your mistakes! Is self-justification the only firepower you need? Only continued self- legitimization gives one... the right to be political. I don't need firepower. Defending yourself can be the best offense. Do you really think you can defend the rear... by weakening the front? To control fast people, you need equally good brakes. October was a speed-demon. One heading over the cliff. That's why... But even I admit that they guaranteed... the Society's strength. Much more than you. Only you could say that. Think what you have done. What have you done to the October Group? Fall... Finish what you start. Winter's mobilized. That was your proposal. Don't forget that. I haven't. Fall commands October. And October is part of Fall. Don't isolate them. That'll only cause trouble. The Winter Army's waiting for October. Fall will fight for the day of the mass assault on Tokyo. The day it will marshal the Four Seasons. You're optimistic to think Fall troops can do it alone. Real war can't be fought on optimism. "Time Bombs Hit Police Targets" "Explosion at Police Dorm!" "Police Prepare for Guerrillas" "Police Station in Shambles" "Grenades Were Stolen From U. S. Army" We knew this would happen. You should've known that. We're soldiers-soldiers of the revolution. It's very clear. So what's your point? What's clear? We had a duty. We fought, and some got hurt and died. Does duty include being injured? That's right. A death under Four Seasons command is a soldier's death. Right? It's a death contributing to revolutionary history. You're a fool, Saturday! What? You're the one who's strange. It's Monday. Open it! What's wrong? October! Your eyes... That's right. At least you're still alive. Where are the explosives? They're OK. February snatched them. The Winter Army stole them. Winter? Winter's February? Let's not ask why. That's not the big issue for us. Why not? Didn't... Didn't we get hold of those bombs? I can't believe it! Idiot! Are you trying to privatize the struggle? February taught us about that. Now where are we? What are we doing now? Saturday! Who erased us? Tell me! We haven't been erased. Is that what you want? There's no use asking you... Punk! I can't figure you out! It's your fault you're stupid! October, in my mind... Fall just doesn't matter anymore. Bing-bong boiled beans Cross the tightrope. Ah! Stop fooling around! It does still matter! We're facing a crisis. At a time... At a time like this... You lazy cowards don't offer one single solution! Fence-sitters! Fence-sitters? Fine. Let's fight personal wars personally. Any complaints? Stop it! That's not the issue! We must discuss our vectoricity as a group! You're all wrong! Vectoricity? What a big word! Stop the tongue-twisters! Let's do it, Friday! OK. So what's the personal struggle? Isn't it just self-satisfaction? All issues are determined by the world revolution! Is self-satisfaction a politics? A doctrine? Self-satisfaction is certain to self-satisfy. That's it. I shatter the darkness with a bomb from my own hands! Don't boss me! To hell with Fall and Winter! Fool! That's egoism! Nothing but egoism! Monday... We're revolutionary soldiers. We have rules. You're just an egoist! Monday... We're not just stray-dog anarchists on the streets. Even stray-dogs... have their own powerful beauty. Monday! See you. Monday... Are you leaving? If I don't smash something... I might kill this midget. Wait! Don't let him go! We're soldiers! Four Season soldiers, dammit! "Explosion in front of Police Station" "Two Police Boxes Hit at Night" "Time Bombs at Two Police Boxes" "Time Bombs Found Before Exploding" "Indiscriminate Attacks Continue" October Group seems unable to recover from its mistake. A mistake... you committed. Everybody thinks it's you're fault. I can understand what October feels after what's happened. But... He only worries... and doesn't take command. We share our worries. Monday... you know him? He's after you. He wants to kill you. What for? That's obvious. It's the only thing to do. Is that what you think? They can try to kill me if they want. I'll make October responsible for the group's mistakes. Let Monday run amok... and then snatch control. You're listening? I know the comic book story you wrote. October... He's the problem. Do you still love him? Or is that the comic book? Slow down... Take it easy. Let it slowly recover. How is it? Can you see? The human body is truly a fragile thing. I'm really blind. That flash of fire is... the last thing I'll ever see. Farewell flames of red... I still see them burning! Fuck! Everything's red! I want you to hold me. You do? Fire! Fire! Our flames! Fuck! There's a fire in my head! Burning forever! What's the rush? A message from Fall. We should disband and join Winter on the run. Anything else? She says she thinks of you when she's doing it with me. I'll settle October's accounts. I don't need anyone's help. Does it hurt? Who cares? Don't say that. We haven't given up yet. What's that mean? We can't do anything in this state. Yes, we can. What about Fall's orders? Forget them. We'll do something better: choose our own direction. Splinter off? Yes. You're just mad that you're blind. What about Fall or merging with Winter? We don't have any explosives, anyway. We can't go crazy like Monday. Shut up! Both of you shut up! Do what you want. Isn't that OK? We were October soldiers, and we survived our own mistake. We just can't play big anymore. I'll act when I'm ready. Isn't that OK? Get out of my way. I'm October. Get lost if you can't follow my orders. I won't leave. Then watch me well. But if you're spying for Fall, you'd better stop it. Fall is Fall... but October Group will act on its own. Do you have explosives? Yes. Not a lot, but enough. Where are they? I'm not telling you. Grenades? Plastic? First we'll inform Fall. Not you, but me. How? I'm the only one who can contact her. - Don't show off! - I'm not! I'm just using reason. You listen to me. If you forget you're an October soldier... I'll kill you. What about our accounts? Start again. Now? Yes. Start from scratch? Liquidate this place. Liquidate? Yes. Prepare to decamp. What a waste of explosives. This is our declaration. Don't be stingy. Light it up and go. OK. "Apartment Explosion" "Radical's Bomb Kill 11" Monday's laughing: Ho-ho-ho, ha-ha-ha The Moon's gone daffy. Yes, quite daffy. Monday's right. You have to act when you're ready. I will, too. Wait! There's no use in splitting up. October, ifyou're going to act, make a plan. And contact the WinterArmy. That's the "proper" way. So where's the goods? Winter took them. But... there's some more here. Then give me some. I have a right to it. Stop treating me like a kid! I'm pulling my own weight. Yes. By watching us for Fall. Spy! But I don't care who you are. Just do what you want to do. OK, Kid? Are you trying to kill yourself with these? It's all because you're not taking command. Fall's done for and it's your duty to merge with Winter. Fall asked me to help you. Shut up! You've got to wait for Fall's orders! You're no longer October's leader. October's defunct! Shut up! How dare you betray the Party! Damn you! I'll call Fall and tell her about your misconduct. Or call Winter's commander. What? Do you think anyone will follow your orders? You'll never get what it's like to risk death in war! You're blind. It's all over! You're powerless! What? I'm a victim, too. The mistake wasn't our fault. We're ready to fight! That's why we don't like the Company's orders. Or Fall's. Fall's suffering, too. She's crying. That's enough. No! Company orders are orders! If you don't obey, you'll lose sight of the objective. I said shut up! I can foresee everything... Even up to the day you'll die. Then why resist it? Because I can see. I can do nothing to change this world. Our October Group or the Company can. Who is it? Monday! I thought you'd be here. Where's Friday? October? Out on a job. October's here. That right? That's all the better. OK, come on in. Don't be shy! Get on in here! He's a jazz man's assistant. Right? So just ignore him and let's get started. Come on! Don't just stand there! You're whores, aren't you? That's right-your pay! Is this work? Yeah, a photo spread. OK, take it off! Panties, too. Yeah! You get in the shot, too. OK, from there. That's good! That's right. Com'on! You strip, too. Hold it! No back talk now! Do it for real. Really do it? That's what you do, isn't it? But my face'll show... Stupid! I'll cut it out. And pay you double. OK, do it! It's OK to fuck her. Right? Friday left with some bombs. Really? That's ok. You do something, too. What? Strip, what else? Use your mouth, hands, anything! - Like this? - Yeah, whatever. Do it for real! - It's still limp. - Then make it harder! I'll suck it! Yeah! You've got talent! What're you doing? Hold it! Let me change the film. What're you up to? Do you want to ruin everything? Answer me! Stop this now! Stop griping! Let's continue. I refuse! Really? OK, so I'll do it. - Can you still shoot? - Yeah, it's avant-garde How cool! - How about lesbian sex? - OK! Let's do it! Show it, now! That's it! Start moving downwards... Yeah! Change positions! Yeah! Harder now! That's great! - Fuck this! - What are you doing? Stop it! It's not the time for this. Leave! You're not wanted here! OK, so who is wanted here? I can't believe what you're doing. It's just a respectable job. I won't follow your orders. Leave! Go home! Please leave! Well, we're mostly done. Thanks a lot! Come again sometime! OK! I need money. I need bombs. And I've got to do it alone. That's all. Don't mess with my work. You're doing it all wrong! Do you want to ruin us all? You don't know a thing, punk! You can't fight a war. We're real soldiers. We die throwing bombs. While you just sit around moving pawns, I throw bombs with this arm and bleed with this body. That's anarchism! Anarchism, yes! But I don't draw up factions like you! Cause I work alone. There is no revolution. Blood washed away a soldier's heroism. Every day wears you down. That's nonsense! You're giving up! Idiot! You're the one giving up! I'm still dedicating myself to the mythical party! That's your miscalculation, mixing myth and reality. Shut up! The ones mixing them up are you, October and Fall. Making dictates rule over people! At any rate... I'm going to do what I can by myself. How about you? We'll clean up October... whatever Fall thinks. We'll smash our targets... both the big and the small fry. Are you still tagging along? Choose which side you're on. Here, you do it. That's the only way to regain mutual trust. What's the target? That's up to you. I don't dislike you. Maybe small fry, big fry, the mythical party... anything goes. But I can't think of any fry without the Four Seasons. Even these... I'm only holding because it's October's order. What? When you risk your life and your body... the Party's irrelevant. In fact, that what's scary. If you act on your own once, maybe you'll never stop. That's right. And October will make that it's doctrine. October Group... Four are already dead. What's wrong? What's wrong, Monday? He's worked so hard, he's ruined himself. He mustn't die alone. Is this your way of cleaning up? Yes. Giving one's life is the only way to settle accounts. What will you do? I... I'm October's soldier. That decision is better late than never. Why the theatrics? That was for real. For real? October Group is on the attack. Blowing up apartments? Is October crazy? - Is this October's order? - Yes, it's our pay back. "Our"? Yes, I may be your spy, but I was October's soldier first. I will go on as a soldier. Monday's left. Friday went on the attack. I'll kill them! October will clean up using his fireworks. Go to hell! I'll follow October. If they want to die, I'll kill them! I'll kill you, too! You mean nothing to us now! A lightweight! Just a woman! I'll kill all of you! You're powerless now. You can't order me around. Even the October you still love... won't listen to you anymore. I'd like to kill you. Dammit! I won't enjoy it. Yeah... Small fry! Punk! Shut up! I'll stop seeing you. I want to kill you so much! I'm sick of your face. I'm sick of your putrid body. I won't fall for your seductions. You'll really dump me? Tell October. This is my last order. I won't listen. Fall's dismissal ceremony is tomorrow at 10. He'll understand. October's blind... and I'm deaf. The bastard's grown... "Repeated Guerrilla Attacks" "Bomb Threat Spreads" "On Guard Against Guerrillas" "Japanese Islands Explode" "Bomb Fires Everywhere" "Guerillas Run Amok in Capital" This is a silent battle front. This is a silent battle front. Ask me why? Because my grave's not here. Because my peace's not here. Because my love's not here. So... That's why this is A silent battle front. The traces ofyour Crimson blood are gone. Your bluish corpse is gone. Your white soul is gone. This is a silent battle front. But that doesn't mean that I'm lonely. That I'm hot. I just walk, keep going, Not even breathing a sigh. Forgetting scars of dried up tears. Grasping a gun to meet my enemy. This is a silent battle front. From that incandescent instant, That infinite instant, The infinite instant of yours and mine, The instant we bet everything, Yes... Everything stopped at that moment. Even the peace of our love. Even the red scars of our love. All right. October didn't come. So what? I won't let you blame it on October! I won't let you say a thing! Fall's fallen apart! The problem is we shouldn't have dictated standards. It was meaningless to talk about equalizing power. That was a mistake. I... I... I've made a terrible mistake! They're people who can fight alone with their own bodies. October can truly fight a personal war personally. Not you. Not people like you! You gain nothing by fearing independence! A lone vanguard will change the world. Isn't that right? The people will always be the people. The masses will always be the masses. An independent vanguard will shape the world! October... October... I'm coming, too. I'll go on... with all of you. I've gotta go. I... I've come from far away. That's why... That's why... I've got to go far away from here. Gotta go... Gotta go... Gotta go... Gotta go to the battle front. We've got no money... No car... Our comrades... They've all gone to battle. October... Where do you plan to hit? Let's go together. You can't make it alone... Shut up and go! It's a question of strategy: two are better than one. In scattered attacks... if one falls, the next one takes over. If you mess up, I'll fill the void. But... you won't know where I'm attacking. I'll know. Shut up and go. OK... Let's meet again on the battle ground. We'll never meet again. Let's even forget about meeting. But, I feel like... I owe you something. A debt that will never go away. Debts are borrowed from the dead. There's no other kind. Go! October's soldiers are going to war. All are prepared to die. Open fire! Fire! Fire! October's soldiers are going to war. The false future... We'll smash the false future. Even if there's no night or tomorrow, we will fight. This was also our battle ground.
