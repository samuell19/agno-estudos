[water splashing] [eerie music] [ominous music] - [Woman] There's pain, anger, fear, restlessness, spirits, dark spirits, and they're trapped here. [eerie music] - The house was unique for its time and place, larger than most homes, built outside of town, so it prompted gossip. He, they moved here. He was a doctor, and he built the house so that it also had his office and clinic. You've seen the house, right? - It was the girls. He killed his girls. My grandmother told me. He abused them and beat them, for years. - A European doctor and his family. There were patients who went there, but as I understand it, the people in the house were pretty reclusive, the doctor and his two daughters, twins. [solemn music] - Yeah, we were gonna stay overnight. And we camped in this large room, at the bottom of the stairs. Nothin' happened at first. We went to sleep. I woke up. I heard this sound, like moving, then like crying, coming from upstairs. It was dark. I looked up. I saw this figure leaning over the stair rail, and it looked at me. [eerie music] I'm sure I screamed. Somebody did. We all jumped up and got out of there. It was a long time ago. - These look incredible. How long did you say you've been working on this? - [sighs] I don't know, months, years, really. I heard about the house, ever since I was a kid. - And this house is for real. I mean, everyone says it's haunted. - Classic. Murder, ghosts, sightings, sounds, mystery. It's why I'm doing this, really. - A paranormal investigation? Or like another one of those found-footage movies? - No, no, nothing like another one of those found-footage movies. I want to get in there and capture some real footage, dramatize it with some good acting and some effects, and get it out there and get rich and famous off of it. - [Man] Anyway, uh, like I said, nobody saw much of them, the same thing with the dad. He was a doctor, and he was just a real odd bird. If his patients didn't pay him in 30 days, he'd killed them. - [Woman] Oh, he did not! It was the girls. He killed his own girls. If you're going to tell the story, tell it right. [Man] I am. I was doing that. - You haven't said anything right, since you started talking. Bottom line, it's haunted, for all the horrible reasons a house can be haunted. [footsteps clattering] [dramatic music] [man moans] - Dude, stop it! - Better check your pants. - That's not funny. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Dillon. Claire, right? Aaron said you were a really good actress and pretty. - Get serious, man. - I am. - This is, uh, Dillon. He's helping me produce this. He's my DP. - Director of photography, actor, co-producer, and just about everything else. Everybody's gonna have one of these, a GoPro, or a cheap knockoff. - They're not cheap. - Just like that one. Aaron's put every penny he has into this thing. - Because this is serious filmmaking. - Yeah, what are you paying her? [laughs] [Aaron laughs] - Uh, that's okay. I'm doing this film for the fun of it. - That's the right reason. - My mom always told me to never spend the night in a haunted house, with an empty stomach. Claire? I've seen you. I know you. I've sensed your spirit. [tense music] There's darkness around you tonight, in that house. The things that are there, the house itself, won't welcome you. And you won't like what you find. I have this gift, to sense and feel, to see what was and what is coming. And what I see is [suspenseful music] bullshit. [laughs] - Actually, I wrote some of it. - Actually, what it was was acting, I'm playing the in-touch-with-the-other-world clairvoyant in the movie. - Oh. [both laugh] You're good. - Thanks. I hear you're good, too, except Aaron didn't tell me that you're kinda pretty. - So, uh, let's eat. Then we can pack up and get on the road, and we'll have our production meeting on the way. [solemn music] - Well, other than Dr. Stanilestri, I believe there was only one other doctor in town, then. The doctor had two daughters, twins. You never saw one without the other. But as I said, they were pretty reclusive. The girls, Sophia and Sara, were mentally ill. It's said the doctor was embarrassed by them. He supposedly used his medical knowledge to try and cure them. [solemn music] - [Aaron] The doctor killed them right there in house? - That's one of the more colorful legends. The girls did die in the house, when they were around 16, I think, during the flu epidemic. The doctor had a mausoleum behind the house, where he buried them. Shortly after that, the doctor died. - [Aaron] He went crazy too, right? Killed himself? - Well, that's another one of those colorful stories. It was likely he died of the flu, also. And he was buried in the mausoleum with his daughters. - Aaron, this looks so good. Huh, you really can't make up stuff like this, can you? - Yeah, we can, at least make up our reaction to it. We have the story. Now, all we need is an ample amount of fear to go with it. Right, baby? - [Aaron] That's the trick. [gentle piano music] [birds chirping] [birds cawing] [gentle piano music] [birds cawing] Jill, camera! - Wait, nobody goes in the house, till they run some behind-the-scenes stuff, some bonus material. - [Claire] This looks like something out of a movie. - It is now. - Where have you been? Everyone around here knows about this place. - [Claire] I mean, I just got into town. All of this is new to me. - All right, let's get the gear. Let's get this thing rolling. - Wait a minute. Let's go inside, check it out, get a feel for the place, find out where to set things up. - [Aaron] Dillon, help him with the gear, first! - What the hell? [birds cawing] It's locked. It's boarded up. - What? - [Jill] I thought that real estate lady was supposed to have it open for you. - Let's call her and get her out of here. [birds cawing] [ominous music] [birds cawing] - She told me she had something else she had to do, so she came over here and unlocked it. - She didn't unlock it. She didn't get that done. - Aaron, just try calling her, or we can go meet her somewhere. - I told you she's not around. - Well, she screwed up and forgot, and she's gonna want to come unlock it and make it right. Just call. - Jill, who's the director here? [birds cawing] - Look, I can just go around and check the back. Claire, come on. - Sure, okay. [birds cawing] [solemn music] [birds chirping] [birds cawing] This is a real pain, isn't it? - If we had any money to pay her, Pomonas Real Estate would be out here with that front door opened, a bottle of champagne, and a red carpet for us. [birds cawing] Dammit! I don't believe this. The last time I came here, I didn't check the back, because the idea was that we would be going in through the unlocked front door. [suspenseful music] Claire? Oh. Yeah. It's cool, huh? - [Claire] They were buried there? - The girls, their dad. - What happened to it? Why is it all tilted? - Over the years, it's just kind of drifted into the ground. It may be a sinkhole or something. It's all underground, anyway, the burial vault. They say when you open the doors, there's steps that lead down to where the caskets are. When I was a kid, we used to dare each other to go down to where the tomb was, but now nobody's getting down there. - Nobody? [suspenseful music] [birds cawing] [suspenseful music] - Okay, well! We should probably tell Aaron that we didn't find anything back here. - Aaron, just try calling her. Maybe she got caught up. At least talk to her. I mean, she's still good with this, right? [birds cawing] Great, now you're gonna be a jackass-pouty baby. This'll be a fun night. [kick thuds] [Aaron grunts] [kicks thudding] - I won't be stopped! [Aaron grunts] [wood cracks] [birds cawing] [solemn piano music] [sighs] Showtime. [solemn piano music] Claire, just put that over there, okay? [solemn piano music] [ominous music] [solemn piano music] Here, here! [stair creaks] - Of course it creaks. [tense music] - [Jill] Claire! [Claire laughs] Whoa, you okay? - [laughs] Yeah. - Come on and help out, okay? - [Claire] Okay. - Look, I'm sorry about Aaron's psycho, country fit, out there. - It's fine. - It's not, and he knows it. - This place really is a vibe about it, doesn't it? - A vibe? - Yeah, you know, like a feeling. [solemn piano music] - Look, who's the clairvoyant in this movie? - Um, you. [laughs] [tense music] [birds cawing] [generator whirring] - It still works, and this will work. Lookin' good! [Jill clears throat] - Hey, Dillon, why is it that the guys can put on their own cameras, but the girls need your help? - [Aaron] Here we go! Woo! [laughs] - Sweet. I love technology. - Okay, everybody's camera records internally and sends it back here to the base. We'll be able to talk over the headset mics, and audio will transmit back here too. I spent tons on extra batteries and memory cards. So we'll be good if we need backups. - Um, so everyone's going around alone? - No, we're gonna be going in teams. Claire, you will be going with Dillon, and I will be going with Jill. All right, everybody, give me your phones. [sighs] I, I don't want to, I don't want anyone, uh, having a phone in the house. [laughs] So, so if you get scared, you don't text or tweet or call Mommy and Daddy for help. - We're not gonna do that. I'm not! - We'll need our phones. This is an old house. Somebody could get hurt. - We've got a first aid kit, somewhere. - Like 911 hurt. - Look, Jill, the phones will be right here. [sighs] If anything really scary does happen, I don't want anyone making the impulse call for help. This kind of movie is a lot better if there's an air of isolation around it. [eerie piano music] - I love you, but you're really getting weird about this. [drawer thuds] [bell rings] [generator whirring] - Something's going to happen tonight. I can feel it. Something paranormal, weird, scary. Okay, even if nothing happens tonight, we're going to make something happen. - You mean fake it. - Jill, one way or the other, we are not leaving this house until we have a scary movie. - Sweet! I'm with you, man. - Let's do it. - That's why I'm here. - All right. - All right, ready or not, ghosts, here we come. - All right, everyone's cameras recording? [cameras beeping] No, it's, uh, it's right here. [camera beeps] - Don't! [Dillon chuckles] - Okay, seance time. - Seance? - Builds tension and suspense. Four attractive young people in a creepy house? This is a movie, you know. [laughs] [suspenseful music] Okay, everybody, close your eyes and clear your minds. [suspenseful music] - We're really, finally, really doing this. - [Aaron] Dillon! [Dillon grunts] - We enter this house with peace, not threatening, here to wake and welcome the spirits that reside. We now call on the spirits of Sophia and Sara Stanilestri. And we call on the spirits of Dr. Stanilestri. Come to us now and make your presence known. [suspenseful music] Hear us. Come to us. We want to meet you. [girls crying] We ask for a sign of your presence. [girls crying] [dramatic music] [Claire yells] - What? - There! [Claire gasping] Something there, I saw it! A figure, a person, something! - A ghost? - No, no. It was, it was just a figure. I don't know! Something's there! [Claire gasps] - Oh, you're really good. She's really good. - No, no, I, I swear I actually saw, I actually saw someone. I'm serious! I saw something! I swear! - All right, that was a great seance. Nice way to start this off. [tense music] The flight to the infirmary are down here. The doctor's in the girls' bedrooms are upstairs. I'm gonna get the flashlight, to make sure everything is- [flesh splats] [Aaron yelling] - Aaron! - Oh my god. [Aaron groaning] - Pull it out! Pull it out! - Hey! - Get it out. [Aaron sobbing] [board creaking] [Aaron yells] [dramatic music] [Aaron groaning] [solemn music] - [Jill] Claire, it's in my things. [Aaron groaning] Okay, it's okay. You're all right. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. [Aaron groaning] You're all right. - [Claire] Ah, let's see what's in here. Get it open. - Oh my God. - Breathe. - This, this, there. Get that. - Yeah. - Okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Breathe. - Okay. - Come on! [Claire groaning] - All right, that's it. Night's over. I'm taking you to the ER. - Be careful. - No! - Careful. - You've got to get this looked at. - Keep it smooth. - It is being looked at. - Dillon, talk to your idiot filmmaking friend here. [solemn music] Jackass! I don't believe this. Aaron, you had a nail go through your foot, all the way through. Our little Boy Scout first aid kit is not gonna be enough. - She's right. Let's just leave here. - [Aaron] It'll be fine. - No, we'll make your movie some other night, okay? Maybe something's telling us we're not supposed to be here. - Jill. [gasps] - It does look ugly, bro. - Thank you, finally. - Look, it's bandaged. I'll, I'll take some aspirin for- - Like hell! You need a tetanus shot. You'll get lockjaw. Have you ever seen anybody with lockjaw? - How am I gonna get tetanus and lockjaw in the same night? - Oh, thank you, doctor. How do you think you're gonna do your movie like this? You think you're gonna walk around the house being Ghostbuster with this foot. [Aaron groans] - You all right? - [Aaron] Yeah, it just hurts a little. [Aaron grunts] - [Dillon] The pressure should stop he bleeding. - Great, everybody's a doctor now. All right. If we're gonna do this, let's make your damn movie. [light switch clicks] - Okay, everything looks good. Dillon, Claire, upstairs, bedrooms are up there, doctor's room [groans] and the girls'. Jill, downstairs hallway, toward the back of the house, somewhere along the way, you should pass the infirmary area. I need tension, suspense, and fear, especially from you Jill. You're the one in touch with the other side. - You got it. - Okay. Action. [stairs creaking] [suspenseful piano music] [pills rattling] [suspenseful piano music] [can hisses] [Aaron sighs] - [Dillon] You seein' this, Aaron? - If it's not haunted, it should be. - Any idea which room belonged to the girls and which room belongs to the doctor? - Well, I guess you could just start by opening doors. Jill. Jill! Jill, Jill, come on, give me something. - There's something here. There's something written on the wall. [suspenseful music] - What is it? Something written in blood? - No, spray paint. - It's the word boo, what? Dammit, Jill! - I think it's some kind of warning. - Come on! Probably some pot-smoking kids snuck in here and did that 30 years ago, probably your parents! Quit screwin' around. - [laughs] Come on, baby. I'll get serious enough, in a minute. [Jill laughs] - Whatever might happen in this house, tonight, is nothing compared to what'll happen if Aaron doesn't get his movie. [Claire laughs] [door creaks] [Claire gasps] [suspenseful music] We're going into the first room. [suspenseful music] - Cool. Okay, I need some suspenseful narration. - Okay. Well, it's cold in here, much colder than in the hall. - She's right. You could really tell. Not much left in here. It's obviously somebody's bedroom. - [Aaron] Obviously. Who's? - Not sure. Pretty spooky though. We might catch some orbs or energy apparitions. - Over against the wall. Is that a wardrobe? - The closet thing. - Yeah, the, [sighs] yeah, the wardrobe. Can you go look inside it? [Dillon sighs] Claire, you go. - Me? - Look, I'll, I'll do it. - No, I want Claire to do it. These kinds of things are scarier when a girl does it. [Claire chuckles] [suspenseful music] - [Dillon] Damn. [Aaron sighs] - What? What is it? - [Dillon] Empty. - Empty? - Empty. - Move on. [voices whispering] [eerie music] - Hey, what's going on? [eerie music] - Hold this. [eerie music] - [Claire] Oh my god. - What is it? - Dr. Stanilestri's lab coat. [eerie music] [Aaron chuckles] - Okay, this is scary. - He was a doctor. - With blood on his coat. - Blood? - And he was hiding it. - God. - Oh god! - [Aaron] No, no, wait, wait! Get a better shot of that. - It's back in there, and it's staying there. - I don't think so. It's coming with us. We've discovered something. This could be a big thing for my movie. Look, we came here, because we heard that there was something about this place, something that was true to what all they say about it. And now we found something that gives that credibility. And on top of that, it's scary. - Look, just give me a minute. I'm with you on this man. But this guy has blood on his lab coat. This guy might've been murdering people. - Yeah. [laughs] - I'm not going to carry that coat around. It's staying in here. Look, I'll come back and get it, as we leave. I'm not gonna carry it around, all night. - Look, if Dillon is crapping his pants over whatever's going on up there, then I'm gonna go up there and make something happen with it. - Shut up, Jill. - No, Jill, I need you working things down here. - Why? So I can see more scary graffiti on the wall? - [sighs] Just keep moving. The infirmary's back there somewhere. [eerie piano music] - Oh wow. [suspenseful music] My turn now. [Jill chuckles] This wins an Oscar for Best Set Design. - Sometimes, the doctor would keep patients overnight or for a few days, if you needed to keep an eye on them. Move on, go slow, and remember- - I'm the psychic in the movie. - You are the psychic in the movie. - Okay, I'm feeling something here. There's pain, fear, anger, restlessness, spirits, dark spirits who never made it out of this room alive. They're trapped here. [gasps] Aaron, are you, are you seeing this? On, on that bed, like a body? - Uh-huh. Come on, move closer to it. - Like hell. - I just want to get a better shot of it, is all. [Jill gasps] [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [Jill gasping] [flashlight clatters] - Aaron, Aaron! - Jill! - Something fell off the bed. [gasps] I dropped my flashlight. - Well, grab it. I can't see anything in the shot. - Okay. [Jill gasping] [suspenseful music] [Jill grunts] [scoffs] Nothing but sheets. [dramatic music] What? [eerie music] - This is where all the underage kids came to drink? - Used to be, not so much now. - Guys, don't waste any more time here. Unless this a haunted trunk, we're not going to beat that lab coat. - Wait! [voices whispering] What is that? - What? [voices whispering] - Wait. What is that? A whisper. [Dillon sighs] [eerie music] - It's one of the Stanilestri girls. - You sure? - It's gotta be. Who else could it be? - Looks like daddy or somebody was pissed off at the other sister. - Or this one. - So cool. Be sure to bring that with you when you come back down here, okay? - Hey, remember me? I'm in the psycho sick room with the straps on the bed. [wood creaking] [suspenseful music] [Aaron groans] [Aaron gasping] [suspenseful music] [switch clicks] Aaron. - [Aaron] What? - There's something out there, around the mausoleum, like a person. - What? - For real, I'm serious. - I can't see anything from here. - Well, I can. I just can't get a good shot from here. - Is this for real? Or is this for my movie? - Aaron, jackass! - Jill stay there. Dillon, get down here. [Aaron sighs] Hmm. Yeah, that's nice. Okay, Dillon, I need you to get the camera off the tripod in the entry hall and take it around back and get a closer look at whatever it is that Jill is seeing back there. - Do you really want me to do that? - Yes, Jill's camera angle is too wide. I can't get a good look at what she's seeing back there. - What happened to things being scarier when girls do them? - Get the camera, go back there, shoot it! What do you think we came here for? [tripod clicks] Where are you going? - [Claire] With him. - No, I need you here. Dillon. Back upstairs, to the girls' rooms. [stairs creaking] [suspenseful music] - [Dillon] All right, I'm on the side- [static crackling] - Dillon? - Headed toward- [static crackling] - Dillon? - Mausoleum. [static crackling] - Dillon, do you... [computer beeps] [ominous music] [Aaron sighs] - Aaron, can you hear me? Aaron? [suspenseful music] - Hey, Dillon, I see you. Dillon? - [Aaron] Jill? - Yeah. I can see him out there, but he can't hear me. - I've lost sight of him, too, audio and video. [door creaking] [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] - If anybody can hear me, I, I'm almost done out here. I don't see anything. I'm almost done out of here. I... [suspenseful music] [ominous music] [suspenseful music] [eerie music] [leaves rustling] [heartbeat thumping] [girl sobbing] [Dillon gasps] [heartbeat thumping rapidly] [dramatic music] [Dillon thuds] - Dillon? Dillon! [Aaron sighs] [computer beeping] [dramatic music] - [laughs] It's just me, sorry. - I thought you were back in the infirmary. - I saw Dillon outside the mausoleum. Whatever I saw back there isn't there anymore. - Uh-huh, well, why don't you go back to the infirmary? I need you to get more scary stuff back there. - Bars and shackles aren't enough? I mean, what do you think was going on with that stuff in a room full of sick people? What are you doing with that? - It's for the pain. Getting impaled in the foot hurts a lot. - But it looks like a lot of the pills are already gone. You told me you'd quit. You're still hooked, aren't you? - It's under control. - Jackass. Really? Under control? Is that why you're sneaking and lying about it? - [Claire] Aaron? - Yeah. - You're getting all this, right? - Yeah. Looks like one of the girls' rooms. - Yeah, um, I'm seeing two of almost everything in here, uh, except the stool and, uh, the bed. - Looks like a prime location to do something. You can find the other girl's room, in a minute. I'll get Jill and Dillon to join you, and we'll milk the scary out of that place as much as we can. - Weird. [ominous music] There's like waves of cold in the room, and a smell, like perfume. Really strong. This is just so strange. I've never been around anything like this before, never believed in it. - So she's your psychic now? She's your drama queen? I'll go pay your new star a visit. - Jill! [Aaron groans] [static crackling loudly] [heartbeat thumping] Dillon? Dillon, I'm, I'm getting your signal again. Are you okay? Dillon, can you hear me? [heartbeat thumping] [leaves rustling] [eerie music] [footsteps rustling] [suspenseful music] [eerie music] [solemn music] [heartbeat thumping] I, I, I, I don't see anything here. You just turn around and run into something. - What do you think you're gonna see? - He said something attacked him. - Hey, baby, look at him. Something did. - Aaron, there was something there. - But there's nothing here. [sighs] There's trees back there, all right, you know, bushes. There's a gate back there, somewhere. Maybe you ran into that. - I saw something, too, out the window, remember? I mean, you want all these things to be real, and then you try to find a reason that they're not. - Damn right! - Don't get me wrong. It's cool. Maybe we could use it. You know, get some shots of Dillon's face. It's scarier. - No, that's it. Night's over. Okay, you're crippled. He got clawed across the face, a mark you said he got from running into a tree? I mean, everyone's getting hurt, and this is getting out of control. - No, I don't have enough for my movie yet. - We'll come back. - [laughs] No, we won't. Once we leave, I'll never get everyone back here. - Sure, we will. - No, I won't. And you know that. Look. Let's just, just go for an hour more. Okay? Then we'll get the lab coat, and we'll leave, promise. Dillon? - I don't know. I'm in this. I don't want to let you down, Aaron. But I am not going back out there, to that tomb. I'm not. I just need a few minutes. Okay? - Claire? - I don't know. It's getting pretty weird out there. I mean, I'm not even sure what's going on, myself. Maybe if we give it a time limit, stay another hour and then go. I mean, I said I wanted to help you out on this. - Okay, let's go. Come on! The drama queen and I are going back upstairs, to the twin's room, right? - Jill? Jill. - No! Let's find some ghosts and restless spirits, or at least pretend that we do so that people will jump out of their seats and get their money's worth, okay? Come on. - Jill! - No, really, it's cool, big-time acting job. We'll be the psychic twins. That's the role we're both playing, right? Come on, let's go upstairs. [ominous music] Show the boys what we got. They can stay down here where they think it's safe. - Jill. - Let's go. [ominous music] [stairs creaking] This one here, right? - Uh, Jill. Jill, we need to- - Wait! I'm sensing a presence here? Something dark, something evil. I feel a dark presence here. Actually, I feel two dark presences, competing for dominance. [Aaron sighs] - Dammit, Jill. Then again, maybe that's what this movie needs, a real cat fight. [Aaron laughs] [eerie music] [can hisses] - Okay, it is scary. I'll give you that. So what kind of vibes are you getting, right now? Come on, play it up. Still gettin' that feeling from this room? - The feeling I'm getting right now is more from you than the house. - Oh, this will add an edge to Aaron's movie. - Look, Jill, I've told you this so many times already. I'm doing this because I love acting and I love movies. I thought it was gonna help Aaron and it was going to be fun. You can be the psychic. I don't care. - So are you acting- [dramatic music] [Claire screams] [Claire gasping] [static crackles] - What? Jill! - So what was that? Did you see the girls? - I saw something! - Bullshit! Just say it. You're moving in and taking my part. Well, you can stop it now, because they can't hear you downstairs, and they can't see you either. [camera beeps] [Aaron grunts] [Aaron sighs] [eerie music] You're sleeping with Aaron, aren't you? You're screwing off camera, and I'm getting screwed on camera. - Jill, Jill, I told you. I'm doing this for fun. I just wanted to help you guys. - Sure. - I don't care about being some stupid psychic. I don't care about being the star. You can have it. But I have seen things. I mean it. I don't know why you or Aaron or any of them aren't seeing this, but I am. Isn't the point of this that we would have to make some things up? Well, I wish I could say I'm acting, but I'm not! - Dillon, get up there, get their mics and cameras back on. If there's a fight, I don't wanna miss it. Dillon! - I just found this. It's the twins. It's an old medical file. - Aaron and Dillon put you up to this, didn't they? Did they tell you to start seeing things so that you can mess with me or scare me or make a movie out of this with me as the joke? - No! - Then maybe they're doing this to both of us then. - You mean faking things? - Yeah. - Setting us up? - Yeah, like maybe that was Dillon outside the mausoleum with a mask on. - But I was with him when you saw that. - [Jill] Okay, well, maybe they got their buddies from town to creep around the house and scare us. - But what about his face? That was real. - We didn't see it happen. - You really think he would do that to himself? - Let me tell you something, new girl, those guys have been talking about this movie for so long. Dillon is almost as obsessed as Aaron. Clawing their faces, coming in here days ago to rig the house? They'd do anything. They're geeks, fanboys, tech heads. You've been to the movies lately? They can make anything look real. - But what about what I've seen? [door creaks] [door thuds] [Claire gasping] - You know, in all the haunted house movies, I've always wondered, why would an ethereal, spirit-y ghost even bother with a door? Hey, jackasses, we're on to you. We know what you're doing. We could've been together on this, but we're outta here. We won't be as scaredy girls in your movie, anymore. We're done! [door thuds] [dramatic music] [Jill thuds] [Claire gasping] - Jill! Jill, Jill! Jill, are you out there? Jill! Ah! Are you okay? It's not funny! Jill! [gasps] Oh, my god! Jill! [hands thumping] [ominous music] Jill! Somebody! Is somebody there? Oh my god! [Claire gasping] Jill! [hands thumping] [Claire sobbing] [ominous music] [gasps] Oh my god! [ominous music] [Claire gasping] [static crackling] - And you didn't see anything? - I told you. She was gone when I opened the door. - Well, I didn't see anything down here, either. You had your cameras and your mics off. - You think we're faking this? I mean, me and Jill? But that's what she said about you. This is crazy. You want a real haunted house movie, but you're fine with faking it, as long as nobody's faking you? Well, this is real. Something horrible is happening here, because something horrible did happen here. - Look, enough of this crap, okay. You're so drugged up on your meds, you can't even tell what's real and what's not. Look, I did not do this to myself. I didn't run into a tree or a post, either. And I believe Claire and Jill saw something upstairs. And now Jill is gone. I found this earlier where it wasn't. It's an old medical file. I read just enough to know that it's about twins. And apparently Dr. Daddy was gonna experiment on them or something. Maybe this place isn't a clinic. Maybe it's like an asylum, a nuthouse. And we somehow woke it up. [solemn music] - Maybe one of us did. [solemn music] Could be you have a gift. [scoffs] You didn't even have to act. [eerie music] [voices chant] You weren't looking for the role of the psychic, the clairvoyant. No, it was looking for you. [static crackles] Steps! - Looks like the basement. - Yeah. - I'll find Jill, and then we're gonna get out of here. - Wait, turn your cameras back on. - When Claire and I find Jill, we're leaving this place. And then this movie is over, for us. Come on, Claire. [water dripping] [door creaks] [water dripping] [door creaking] [water dripping] [door creaks] [object rattling] [both screaming] [ominous music] [Claire screams] [ominous music] - [Dillon] Go! [woman shrieks] [Claire panting] [dramatic music] - It is me. Something about me woke up this house. - This house has been haunted for a long time. - Like this? - Listen, okay, this is the basement. We'll find Jill, get Aaron to give us the keys, our phones. We'll call the police, and we'll be gone, okay? Hey, okay? [Claire sighing] [woman yelling] [objects banging] [Claire gasps] [woman yelling] [wood creaking] [woman yelling] [suspenseful music] [wood creaking] [sighs] I can't believe I'm doing this. - You're there. I can see your flashlights showing up on Jill's camera. - [Dillon] Jill. [suspenseful music] - There's no way you guys are making this up, right? - I can't hear you guys. Can you get a little bit closer to Jill's camera? - Hey, Aaron. Shut up and go to hell! We're gonna find Jill. And then we're getting outta here. Your movie's over. [static hisses] [computer beeps] [Aaron sighing] Claire. [wood creaking] [ominous music] [Claire gasps] [ominous music] [stair creaks] [ominous music] Claire. [door clacks] [Aaron panting] [water pattering] [Claire gasps] [eerie music] Oh god, this took us under the mausoleum. [water pattering] [suspenseful music] Claire, Jill's not here. We said we would go. Now let's go. - Why are you awake? - [Dillon] Claire! [solemn music] [dramatic music] [Aaron grunts] [solemn music] - You did something horrible. [suspenseful music] [door creaking] You couldn't live with it. [rope creaking] [suspenseful music] You killed them! Killed them! [dramatic music] [Claire gasping] [eerie music] [footsteps thumping] [lamp clatters] [eerie music] [doctor grunts] [Claire sighs] There were two sisters. Why is there just one other casket? [Claire panting] - Dammit, Claire, are you crazy? [Claire grunting] [suspenseful music] [Claire gasping] - Oh god! They were conjoined twins. [solemn music] [person sobbing] This was your life. [suspenseful music] No hope for anything different. [eerie music] And you hated it. [person sobbing] No one knew. No one was told! [person sobbing] [solemn music] And you! [Claire panting] [Claire chuckles] You hid them away. You were embarrassed, ashamed. How could a doctor have medical freaks for children and not be able to do anything about it? [Claire panting] [eerie music] [door clacks] [doctor sighs] You! [gasps] You hated her! Hated her for the way she made you live! [music box thuds] [Claire gasping] [eerie music] [ominous music] [voice hissing] [solemn music] [eerie music] You killed her! [Claire gasping] [mirror clatters] [Sophia screams] Stop it! Oh my god! [Sophia yelling] [music box thudding] [Claire gasping] [dramatic music] [water pattering] [Sara groaning] You walked around like that, for days. [Sara wheezing] Weeks. [water pattering] Till you couldn't take it anymore. [ominous music] [eerie music] [Claire yells] - Claire, Claire! - No, no, no, let go! - Claire, look at me! - Let go of me! - Claire, look at me. Turn it off. - I can't! - Turn it off! - I can't! - Claire, look at me. - I can't. - Look at me. It's okay. - I can't. - Claire, it's okay. It's okay. [ominous music] It's okay. [Claire yells] Go! [Claire yelling] Go! [Claire yells] [bones cracking] [patients yelling] [dramatic music] [Claire panting] [dramatic music] [Claire gasping] [Claire sobbing] [Claire yells] [Claire gasping] [sinister music] - I did a great casting job. [laughs] You are really good at this. - Aaron, give me your keys. Jill's gone. Dillon's gone! There's something in this house that isn't us. [Claire gasping] - You're not just a good actress. You're an alarm clock, waking the dead. You've seen them. Sophie and Sara? I mean, you're really seeing them. I read more of the medical file than Dillon did, enough to know that they were Siamese twins, conjoined, and their Dr. Daddy was desperately trying to find a way to separate them. [Claire sobs] From his notes, it looked like he was even experimenting on some of his patients. My movie's turning out much better than I expected. - You're crazy! - You're not? - This is real! This isn't a movie. Those sisters, the doctor, the evil in this house is killing us. [strike thuds] [Claire yells] [ominous music] [Claire sobbing] - Didn't see that coming, did you? [laughs] Yeah, I, I thought the movie could use a twist ending. [Aaron laughs] [Claire gasping] You know, I thought maybe just one person survives the night in a haunted house. You know, it happens that way, sometimes, [Claire gasping] because if it was another one of those found-footage movies, then we'd all have to die. [Claire yells] [ominous music] - You won't kill me! [strikes thudding] [foot cracks] [Aaron yells] [Claire panting] [Aaron grunting] - Dammit, Claire! Who's movie is this, anyways? - It's mine. [stick thuds] [flesh splats] [Aaron thumps] [static crackles] [footsteps rustling] [static crackles] [solemn piano music] [ominous music]
