-Father! -Dear! Father! Father! I am the Goddess Sumbadra. I began to experience romance "My love for Rama is sacred." "And I am a woman who will not accept marriage based on wealth." Layla. Yes, Mother? What's wrong? Pack your things, all right? We can't stay here anymore. We'll live with Uncle Ahmadi's family. Your father still has a lot of debts. We have to sell many of our things. Your father owned a lot of shadow puppets. They can be sold at a good price. Don't, Uncle. I want to be a dalang like Father, Uncle. Layla, you're a girl. What do you know about shadow puppets? Why do you like to fantasize like your father? In the end, he died beneath the waves. -No, Uncle! -My hand. -Don't. -Layla. Enough. Just let it go. Srintil. She's a female character in the novel trilogy by Ahmad Tohari. She's a woman who is strongly against the domination of males who often decide the future of women. Now let me ask you. Who's your Indonesian role model who inspires you to be like them? Dela? Cut Nyak Dhien, ma'am. Cut Nyak Dhien. Who else? -Cut Meutia, ma'am. -Cut Meutia. Who else? All right, kids. Today's class is over. But don't forget your assignment. You have to list important points of the trilogy we discussed. Study the essence and write a summary about how your role model inspires your daily life. Okay, may peace and Allah's mercy and blessings be upon you. -And upon you as well. -And upon you as well. Winda. Do you know where Nita is? She hasn't come to school for three days. Yes, I haven't seen her lately either. I'll ask around. Excuse me. May peace be upon you. And upon you as well. -Ms. Layla. -Yes? May I have your autograph? As a present for my sister in Saudi Arabia. What's your sister's name? Ida, ma'am. Ida, so far in Saudi Arabia. Give my regards to your sister. -Yes, ma'am. -And you. Don't waste your sister's efforts working all the way there, okay? -Thank you, ma'am. May peace be upon you. -And upon you as well. -May peace be upon you, Ms. Niken. -And upon you as well. -Ms. Layla. -Ms. Niken. How did today's Indonesian language class go? It went well. And your Math class? Well, it wasn't bad. A little progress, thank goodness. Thank goodness. Ms. Layla, how's your second novel? Are you done writing it? No, I'm out of inspiration. Writer's block. How's your love life? Anything new? Gosh, why did you suddenly bring that up? Well, are you still thinking about Ilham? Goodness, no! Why are we talking about Ilham? We're both looking for a muse. Speaking of Ilham, have you heard any news from him about Azerbaijan? Oh, that. No, I haven't. It's only been a month since I applied. Is that so? Anyway, just relax. I always pray for you. I hope in Azerbaijan, you'll meet an Arabian prince. -Handsome, rich, and successful. -Wow. He'll have everything. And you'll get married. -Then you'll have kids… -Are you daydreaming? I'm praying for good things for you. Who says Azerbaijan is Arabian? Azerbaijan is next to Turkey. What? Ailin. -Why are you still here? -Ma'am. I'm waiting for my husband, Aldi. His motorbike broke down. Well, I can take you with my bike. You can sit on the back. What are you saying? She's four months pregnant. She'll give birth on the way. I'll go slow. -Come on. -Don't listen to her. -Just wait a little longer. -Ms. Layla! -Ma'am! -What's wrong? -It's bad, ma'am! -What is it? Nita sent this picture. -What is it? -Nita's on the edge of the bridge! The bridge? What's she doing? I don't want to be forced to marry someone I don't love, ma'am. Tell your parents that you already have someone that you love. My mother doesn't like Johan, ma'am. What is it? -Let's go after her. -Yes, ma'am. Excuse me, ma'am. I need to go. Yes. Nita! Nita! Nita! Nita! Nita! Nita? Nita! Nita? Nita! This can't be! This is all my fault. Ms. Layla, it hurts! Nita! What are you doing? I was afraid something terrible happened to you. I'm mad at you! Don't you dare to try this again. Come. My parents finally approved of my relationship with Johan. Thank goodness. That's great. Then why are you trying to commit suicide? When I told Johan… he gave me an invitation. He's marrying his ex. She's four months pregnant. Gosh, that jerk! Bastard. Then who am I supposed to marry, ma'am? What if I become an old spinster like you? What are you talking about? Worrying about weddings, about marriage. You can do a lot of things before marriage. I better ask my parents to arrange my marriage. What are you saying? I've always wanted to get married young. And go on a honeymoon in Mecca. On a Hajj pilgrimage. Wait, after the Hajj pilgrimage, then what? I need to go, ma'am. -May peace be upon you. -And upon you as well. May peace be upon you, Ilham. And upon you as well, Layla. Soon you can enjoy the smell of the Caspian Sea. Don't lie to me. Why would I lie? Look here. Addressed to Nur Layla Mashabi. "Your application has been accepted." "You will be a guest lecturer here for 2 weeks." Oh, my, is this for real? For real, my sister. Mr. Ambassador has asked me to prepare everything for you here. -Thank goodness. See you. -See you. -May peace be upon you. -And upon you as well. I have a surprise for you. My application was accepted. I will be a guest lecturer in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan, Mother! Thank goodness. Gosh. At last, your dream has come true. You can finally go abroad. What's wrong, Mother? You will be married off to Ibnu Salam. You're joking, right? There. Ibnu has come with his father to propose. Excuse me, sir. Ibnu was that kid in school whose sandals I used to hide. I made him cry. Yes, but he's changed. Graduated from a foreign university, rich. And a candidate for regent. Child, don't forget. Mr. Ibnu helped you and your mother a lot. He paid your tuition. He also paid your father's debts. All right? Come on. Layla. Do you know? I've tried to introduce dozens of girls to Ibnu. He's not interested. He wants… Well… He only wants you. Because Layla has been my friend since we were kids. I feel comfortable with her. I see her as intelligent. Brave. Religious. So I think she's the only suitable partner for me. Partner? Yes. The partner of… A regent. I mean the wife of a regent. A regent? By Allah's will, we will also run for governor. By Allah's will. I think we can set the date. How about next month? Wait. We are planning a marriage, right? A marriage is decided by both sides. Am I right? Tell you what. Normally, Ibnu goes with his father's decision. Well, now it's different. Because it concerns me personally. And I will be Ibnu's future wife. I too have the right to decide. Am I right? Why me? Do you have to ask again? I've told you. You're a modern woman, and kind. I've known you for a long time. And you're religious. I… Look, there are a lot of women like me, Ibnu. It doesn't have to be me. You… Okay, you're mean to me. How am I mean to you? What are you saying? I don't know anyone else like you. Why would I waste time trying to find other women? While you're here in front of me. Layla, I promise you. I promise. If… Let's say we get married. I will be a good husband. And if, by Allah's will… One day we'll have beautiful children… I will be a perfect father. But you have to promise me one thing. Promise you what? Don't you ever hide my sandals again. Don't you ever do that again. You did that all the time. That's all I ask. I accept your proposal. But on two conditions. I want to keep teaching. Like before, like now. You know. -I can do that, right? -Of course, it's up to you. If possible, you can teach in a more modern and classy school. You can teach wherever you like, it's up to you. Second, I want to go to Azerbaijan. Go where? Layla! Ilham, how are you? So good to see you. I'm happy to see you too! Thank you. Wait at the guest room. I'll tell Mr. Ambassador that you're here. Oh, okay. Welcome. Thank you. Welcome to Azerbaijan, Layla. Thank you, sir. So glad. She's so beautiful. Please. They dance very well, sir. They are Azerbaijani students who study at the Azerbaijan University of Languages. They're studying the Indonesian language, literature, and Indonesian traditional dances. They will be your students, Layla. I happen to be from Semarang. My name is Layla Mashabi. Thank you for having me here. That name is very familiar to me. And for all people in Azerbaijan. It is the name of a great work by Nizami Ganjavi in the 12th century. Layla Majnun. This is the book. Layla Majnun. Yes, my late father named me Layla based on this romance, Layla Majnun. This is a romantic country, Layla. People who come here always return and they feel at home. Oh, be careful. You might find love here, just like Ilham. Again, thank you, Layla. -Thank you for having me. -Good luck. -Okay, excuse me. -Thank you, sir. Samir. Yes. The food is almost ready. And… But does she remember me? Right, I'll prepare some tea. Thank you. Thank you. What's wrong, Ham? Is the tea good? It's good. Is the server handsome? Is he? He will be your student, La. A Master's student. Took his Bachelor's in History. He worked for an oil company in Indonesia. He returned here to major in Indonesian Studies. -Is this black tea? -Yes. So good. Now, this is your apartment. The campus prepared it for you, La. It's okay. This room is so nice. Yes. I think this is too much for me. This is a campus facility. It's usually reserved for rectors, lecturers, and researchers. You're actually the youngest lecturer ever. I should've brought my mother here. Hey, Ham. Are you really marrying a local? Many of our friends in Indonesia still have a crush on you. Even Niken still hasn't moved on. When's your turn? What? Getting married. "Because Layla fulfills all the qualifications." "Intelligent, educated, and religious." Our school must be proud. One of our teachers will become a regent's wife. Layla must be so happy. Don't be so sure. Why not? It's already publicized. I'm sure it will happen, Niken. I saw her house is being renovated. New paint. That's not what I'm talking about. But… I'm not sure Layla will be happy. Right, I need to go. -May peace be upon you. -And upon you as well. Now this is the look of a Javanese woman that you often find in Indonesian literature. Let's see you walk. Now, as you can see from her movement. It's a little… It's a little restrictive for Javanese women to move. Because kebaya is a reflection of Javanese females' manners. How Javanese females have to appear tender. -Their obedience. -No wonder. Javanese women are weak and always stand behind their men. I feel sorry for them. Not really, actually. Because behind their obedience, there are principles that they always try to maintain. And behind their submission, they intend to preserve the balance around them. Isn't that right, Ms. Layla? Yes. That is right, as said by… Samir. Samir Asadzadeh. Samir, we've met before at the Embassy, right? Yes. Will you go out with me… to see our literature museum? If you don't want us to go alone, I can ask others to come along. Is anyone interested? I'll pay for lunch. I'm coming. What do you say, Ma'am? Look, Samir. I have an appointment with Ilham. So I can't. Thank you for the invitation. Right. Let's get back to our subject. You guys go that way. Ms. Layla? So Ilham is picking you up? Yes, I'm waiting for him. My philosophy says-- "Philosophy"? Do you mean feeling? My feeling says Ilham can't pick you up. Feelings can be wrong. If my feeling is right, you can go to… that cafe across the street. We'll be waiting for you there. Is she coming? I don't know, maybe she is. There she is. Okay, go away. Your feeling was right, Ilham couldn't pick me up. He and Sabina suddenly had a matter to attend to. Thank you. Do you want chicken or lamb? -Chicken. -My feeling was right again. Here's your chicken kebab. Don't call me "ma'am," call me Layla. We're not on campus. Yes, Layla. How is it, good? It's good. But why does it taste like lamb? It is lamb. My feeling told me that Layla has to try Azerbaijani lamb. I thought she'd like it, and I was right. You've never tried lamb before? No. But now you like Azerbaijani lamb. Check out that girl. Let's ask her out. She looks cool. -Let's ask her. -Hi, miss. -Miss, may we get to know you? -Hi. Can we have your number? Why? What did you tell them? I told them not to get near you because you have a contagious disease. What? Samir was joking, miss. Samir said that you're… his girlfriend. That's why they stopped teasing you. Nizami Ganjavi? -Can you take my picture? -Sure. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. -Are they good? -Yes. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Samir! Ganjavi came from an area in Azerbaijan. With his famous work, Layla Majnun, -I'm sure you've heard. -Yes. The story about Qais, a man who was in love with Layla. But their love story was resisted by both of their families. Then, their story ended tragically. Many people think that Qais became a little insane. He exiled himself in the desert. And he got naked inside a cave. And… For people in Azerbaijan… Sorry. Hello? Wait for me there. Thank you. Said, please keep Ms. Layla company. Layla, just a minute. I heard that you're preparing your second book. It's not finished. I ran out of ideas midway. I think this city will inspire you. -Trust me. -Really? Because I think it will be interesting if… the book is discussed in class by the author herself. My book is not a national treasure, Samir. Students won't study them. If you write your book with honesty and from your heart, I think it will always be interesting to study. Have a drink. La? Yes, Ham. Come in. La, let's go out. -To where? -Nightlife, Baku. I still have work for tomorrow. I haven't finished my materials. Meet with my fiancée, Sabina. -Really? -Yes. -So Sabina is a widow with one child? -Yes. Her ex-husband left her five years ago. She's been raising her son alone. His name is Ali. It's not easy for her to open her heart to a new man. I understand how she feels. It's hard to trust a guy like you. I'm enjoying life, Layla. The smell of the Caspian Sea. But it's not a sea. It's a lake, right? Yes. Like Mr. Ambassador said, you have to try Caspian Sea caviar. Is it good? They say, for a person in love, Caspian Sea caviar will give an amazing sensation. Once you eat some, you will say… Fövqlad. Extraordinary. Fövqlad. I can't wait. I'll definitely try it. Layla, I have a surprise for you. -What? -Do you hear that music? Yes. -Let's go. -Let's go. Come. Love enters our hearts Uninvited Like a muse from the sky Breaking through And resides in our spirit And now we will die from romance. That binds our entire soul. Tell me. Who can live free from the sickness of love? Back then, my childhood house, it was by the sea. You know that this is actually… -It's a lake, I know. -Yes. And this place is also… Known for its tasty caviar. Yes. And it will taste better if… -You eat it when you're in love. -When you're in love. You knew? I bet Ilham told you. He does seem like he's in love. Ilham has found his remedy. And also his sickness. You are everything wrong with me. But at the same time, you are my sickness. -Oh, what can I say? -Oh, what can I say? You are everything to me. -My virtue, my vice. -My vice. -My sickness and my remedy. -My sickness and my remedy. I always remember those words. My father always read me Layla Majnun before bedtime. Until finally… that fantasy was gone along with my father. He was the one who always brought out the best in me. Layla. You're… writing a book, right? How can you write a book without fantasy? It's a true story, Samir. About my mother. How she raised me, took care of me. Educated me. And how she held on against my uncle's cruelty. This is mine, don't! -I'm taking this! -Don't! Mother! Enough about me, Samir. What about you? Do you always read literature out loud like that? Not always, but there are certain times. Or in discussions or something. And actually, based on my country's age, we are still quite young. There are remnants of trauma. In the hearts of Azerbaijanis. Based on past cruelties. And romance has become some kind of… remedy for our wounds. And I understood this more when I was in Semarang. Really? Why? That time I was watching a shadow puppet performance. And I didn't understand Indonesian language well. So I didn't quite understand the words said by the… -What do you call it? -Dalang. Dalang. The story he told. So I was just listening. Then I felt something… Some kind of memory. A little touch of… Not magic. -Mysticism. -Mysticism. I felt it in that process. My father was a dalang. He taught me about shadow puppets. Then you have to teach me about shadow puppets. So I can tell stories to people in Azerbaijan. One or two weeks is not enough to learn shadow puppets, Samir. It takes a long time. I don't mind, even if it takes a lifetime. If you're the one teaching me. I worry about Ali, it's late. It's cold out here. Ilham. Let's go back. Okay. -Are we going? Let's go. -Okay. I think Samir really likes you. He does? I don't think so. He's a friend. A fun friend. Seriously? Just a friend? Are you done interrogating me? I'm done. If you're done, I'm going to bed. I'm tired. Right, madam. -Bye, Layla. -Bye. Hi, Honey. This will be our wedding venue. The bride and groom seats will be there. We'll have a lot of decorations here, okay? Later, we will decorate this place. In Central Javanese style. And the number of guests… Around 2,000 people. Okay? Goodness! Layla. We're on campus now, Samir. I'm sorry. Ms. Layla. May I ask you out to the Old City? Samir, I'm here to teach. Not for a vacation. I have to prepare presentation materials. -I need to go. -Just a minute. No. I need to go. Right. Is everybody present? Where's Samir? He came in, but he left. He said he had to do something important. I don't know how you do things on this campus. But to be clear, if you will miss class, please inform me the day before. By letter. Okay? Now we will discuss famous works by Buya Hamka. I thought we were going to discuss your book. -Says who? -Samir. I decide on today's material. Not Samir. Hi, Ibnu. I'm walking around the Old City. It's called Old City Baku. -Greetings, hi. -Greetings. I just found out that this place was once closed by the Russian government. It was eventually renovated and rebuilt. It became a tourist destination. Ibnu, now I'm in the Shirvanshahlar Palace. This palace was built in the 12th century. And the purpose of this palace was… One, two, three. -Thank you. -Thank you. Hello? May peace be upon you. And upon you as well. Samir? Where are you, Layla? Just walking around. Are you coming? These ladies are returning to the hotel. No need, Samir. I can go back myself. Are you sure? You might get lost. I'll manage. This again? I think I'll have to call Samir. Hello? May peace be upon you. Samir? And upon you as well. Where are you now, Layla? I don't know where I am now. I'm lost. Can you guide me? Okay, I'll help you. Are there any signs near you? What signs? I don't know. But in front of me, there's… There's a house with a door that looks like a fortress. Are you at a corner? Yes, I'm at a corner. Okay, I know that place. Now you walk straight. Then turn left. I'm going down the stairs. Where should I go? Straight ahead? No, Layla. No? Then where to? You told me to go straight to go home, right? You want me to lead you home? Yes. When you see a door with a large tree in front of the house… Do you see it? Now you may knock on the door. Greet her. May peace be upon you. And upon you as well. I'm Layla. Samir's close friend. Samir's close friend. I really want… I really want… To know Samir's family. To know Samir's family. I'm so glad. Samir has found a girl with a beautiful face and heart like you. Samir, who is this woman? What did she say? You have a beautiful face, like your heart. -Mother. -Welcome home, my son. As I promised. I have led you home. To my house. Please come in. -Is she pretty? -Yes, so pretty. Welcome, child. Come in. Please sit down. Çox sağ ol. Çox sağ ol. -Çox… -Çox sağ ol. -Çox sağ ol. -Çox sağ ol. Çox sağ ol. Do you like my cooking? What did she say? My mother said, she hopes that you enjoy the food. Thank you, Ma'am. It's delicious. Try this one. Have some of this too. Yes. -Thank you, Ma'am. -You're welcome. Hello? Wait, I'll meet you there. Mother, I have to go. It won't be long, I'll return soon. -Where are you going? -Won't you finish your meal? Don't worry, Mother. Where are you going? I need to go for a while, you can wait here. I… Can I come along? Yes, okay. Don't worry, Mother. Narmina! Are you all right? Is this Layla? Yes. Layla, this is Narmina. She's like a sister to me, she's my cousin. Don't think about it, I'll find a way. Let's leave this place, come. Layla, please protect Narmina. Layla. -Who are you to interfere? -Go with her. Who are you? Because you interfered with me and Narmina, my wedding plans were ruined! -Get him! -Samir! Samir! Layla! Run! Layla! This isn't over, Narmina. I'll find you again! Narmina, are you all right? Yes, I don't think he'll bother me again. What about you? I'm all right. Are you all right? I'm okay, Samir. Let me take you home. No need. I can go home myself, don't worry. This place is historically significant to all of us in Azerbaijan because of those who died in the Black January tragedy. They died in 1990. This place became a memorial. Because the victims were not only Azerbaijani. But also the Turks who fought with us. I think I was… around two years old when it happened. My father and two of my brothers were also buried here. This is my wound, Layla. Beautifully healed by the shadow puppet story I heard. Do you see that mosque? It resembles the Blue Mosque in Turkey. It's a tribute to the Turks who helped us. Step forward a bit, slowly. A bit more. -Where are we going, Samir? -Just a little, stop. Okay. Don't open your eyes just yet. I'll count to three. One, two… Three. It's so beautiful, Samir. This is one of the best spots to view the city of Baku. And I hope you can get… your inspiration and fantasy. For your book. I will surely get some inspiration from this. Thank you. Voilà. Enjoy. This is my own recipe. Before I worked in the Indonesian Embassy, I worked in this restaurant. And this is my own recipe. They've been using it ever since. -Really? -Yes, please try. Let me taste it. -This is… -And this is not lamb. Are you sure? You're so intriguing. You can read poetry. You're a great tour guide. And your cooking tastes great. Is there anything you can't do? Getting married. That's my mother's wish. But I haven't been able to fulfill it. Thank you for walking me home. Yes, you're welcome. Have a good rest. Thank you. Layla. Yes? I… I want to say that… That you're a good friend? Because I feel the same way about you. You're an amazingly kind friend to me. Thank you for walking me home. And for the tasty food you made for me. I'll go inside. -Good night. -Good night. I'll cook for you again next time. All right, that would be nice. Hello, Ibnu. May peace be upon you. And upon you as well. Layla, where have you been? I've been looking for you all day. Ibnu, I was… There are some wedding dresses from the event organizer. Have you picked one? You already sent the pictures? One moment. No, I just opened it. Layla, you have to pick one. We're running out of time. Yes, Ibnu. But actually I… I still have things to do. I'll call you back, okay? May peace be upon you. And upon you as well. Your bag. -No, let me. -It's okay. -I'll sit in the back. -Don't. Samir will drive. You sit in the front, I'll sit in the back. I'm the groom. Okay? Left steering? Thank you. Layla? Seatbelt. Seatbelt. Okay. Have you locked the door? -Which button? -Oh, I'll do it, sorry. Is the heater warm enough? It's warm enough. You talk a lot, like in a BOD meeting. What's a BOD? Can we go now? Okay. Hey, why were you two so quiet? Like strangers on a bus. What's wrong if I stay quiet? -I just had nothing to talk about. -Where's Demirchi Village? First, I want to thank you for being my wedding witnesses. On behalf of Mr. Ambassador. You know, that means a lot to me. "Because Aya is here." Ilham, Layla. We're in Demirchi. Yes. Just a bit further. -Okay. -Okay. -You know your way from here? -I do. Let me go there first. I'll tell them we've arrived. You two wait here. Just a minute. Okay? Want some candy? Thank you. If Narmina wants to study in Indonesia, I can find her some faculty in Semarang that may grant her a scholarship. She would be happy to hear that. Thank you. You're welcome. -Layla. -Yes? May I say something? If what you want to say will ruin our friendship, it's better that you don't. -Congratulations, may Allah bless you. -Thank you, please come in. Quite a lot of guests. Here, when a marriage proposal is accepted, it needs to be celebrated. I forgot. You have to pretend to be husband and wife. -Don't mess around. -Gosh. I'm serious. Sabina's parents won't accept if you two aren't a couple. And think about how they feel. Their daughter is marrying a non-Azerbaijani. You two can be an example. Husband and wife, Azerbaijani and Indonesian. Happily married. Gosh. What should we do, Samir? Well, it's just pretend. It won't ruin our friendship. Are you two happy? We're happy. Are you happy? What? The father asked if you're happy. You are happy, right? What's the word for "happy"? -Biz. -"Biz." -Xoşbxtik. -"Xoşbxtik." -Bxtik. -"Xoşbxtik." "Biz xoşbxtik." They're happy. And please tell Sabina's father. That Ilham, my brother, is a good person. He loves Sabina and Ali with all his heart. Uncle, please trust Ilham. He's her brother. He's a very good person. -He loves Sabina and Ali so much. -Then I accept. I hope they'll be happy. -May Allah bless them. -May Allah bless them. By Allah's will. May Allah bless you. I wish you happiness, my daughter. Come, please come in. Welcome. This is our house, make yourselves at home. Good night. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Where should I put this? -Here? -Put it here. It's all right, let me do it. Your room… Is this warm enough? It is. I'll sleep outside. Have a nice rest. You… Samir. Here. For you outside. So you won't get cold. Yes, and you want some… -Tea? -No, it's okay. May peace and Allah's mercy and blessings be upon you. May peace and Allah's mercy and blessings be upon you. Layla. Have you heard the story about Qais? He expressed his love to a wall. Layla. I climbed over that wall. And I kissed the house wall. It's not the house that took my heart. But the one who resides inside it. They asked. "Do you love Layla?" I answered. "No." Why? Love is a string that connects. Layla is me. And I am Layla. We don't need a string to connect us. Open your window. If you want to feel… how Qais loved Layla in that time. If you open that window… it will be like you opening your heart. Open it. Layla. Open it. Please open it. Please open it. Won't you open it? Layla? Please open it. The prayer that I recite One thing I hold in my heart Hi, Layla. I need to ask you a favor. Please translate this song. The prayer that I recite What is it about? The prayer that I recite One thing I hold in my heart Samir truly loves you, Layla. But I can't. Why? Because… she will get married soon. How do you know? Uncle Ahmadi called me yesterday. He told me to look after you. Why didn't you tell me that you knew? Why didn't you tell me first? Because I knew you would be angry. Because it wasn't my decision. Of course, I would disagree. You always say that you don't believe in an arranged marriage. You've always wanted to fall in love first, then get married. The fact is my expectations don't always meet reality. The fact is… you have fallen in love in this country. So much that you don't even have courage. To admit the truth to Samir. Where is he now? He returned to Baku. Mr. Ambassador called him. Asking him to help prepare a banquet. She was being chased by a prince. She climbed up the tower. Waiting for her lover to return from the sea. He still didn't return, so she jumped. And her body was never found. That's why we named it the Maiden Tower. But here, it's truly amazing. Ten girls have the beauty of twenty-one. Ten beautiful girls, their shadows, plus one. Hey, Layla. How are you, Layla? -How was Ilham's proposal? -It went well, sir. Really? Thank goodness. Why are you here? I tried to call you, but I couldn't get to you. And Mr. Ambassador gave us permission for our pre-wedding photo shoot here. And this is just for documentation. I pray that your marriage will last. Unlike the legend, Layla Majnun. The two will never meet. We wouldn't want that, sir. -Anyway, I'm praying for you. -Right. Thank you, sir. I'd like to introduce you to the chef who prepared these dishes. His name is Samir Asadzadeh. I hope you'll enjoy the food. Yes, thank you. -I'll get the black caviar. -Yes, thank you. -What's in this? -These are kebabs, vegetables, and meat. This is black caviar. The best black caviar in the world. -This? -From the Caspian Sea. Azerbaijan. -You should try some. -Layla. Thank you. Just like the ones made by my mother. You should try some, here. Layla. How is it? How is it? It's so fresh. Tastes so fresh, yes? How is it, Layla? It's good. If you two think it tastes good, that means Layla is in love with you, Ibnu. When it comes to love… the truth is I'm the lucky one. I have found a beautiful, religious woman. And it's clear that she's in love with me. Excuse me. I'll go inside. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Enjoy your meal. Come, have some more. Yes, sir. Sir, Ibnu. Excuse me. Samir. Samir. Please, let me explain. Is it true that he's your future husband? Do you love him? -Samir. -Say it, Layla. Do you love him more than this friend of yours? Marriage is not about love. For me, marriage is about love. Samir. I made a promise. I promised Ibnu before I met you. We're too late. There's no such thing as a late encounter. And you promised me. I didn't promise you anything. SALMA AGAINST THE STORM SEMARANG, 17TH APRIL 2017 FOR SAMIR HOPE WE'LL MEET IN YOUR COUNTRY -What's your name? -Minto, ma'am. -Minto. -Gosh, finally I got your autograph. Say thank you. -Thank… -Thank… Excuse her, my sister gets nervous when she stutters. I mean she stutters when she's nervous. Thank you. I really like your book. My name is Samir. And I hope one day you can come to Azerbaijan to read your book in front of the students there. I'd love that. Let's hope so. I promise. If I get the chance, I'll come there. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Mr. Ambassador is waiting for you at the table. In two days we'll return to Indonesia. Why in two days? I have a campaign rally to do, and you have to come along. Everybody wants to see the regent's future wife. Is there a problem? Ibnu, I still have a lot to teach. Hasten things up. Mr. Ambassador agreed, okay? No more excuses, you're coming back to Indonesia. Are you leaving Azerbaijan, La? Are you leaving Samir? I can't give what Samir wants. What Samir wants… is for a lot of people to fall in love with your book. The way he fell in love with you. Because of that book. If that's all… SALMA AGAINST THE STORM BOOK READING I don't mind reading my book in front of people. And here she is, Layla Mashabi! How did they know? Because somebody pirated your book and translated it into Azerbaijani. Samir has always wanted you to read this book in front of people. Because he believes that this is a good book. And that it can heal the wounds in many people's hearts. That's what he always told people. What people? Samir was the one who lobbied all the faculty deans here. And he finally made the campus give the okay to bring you here as a guest lecturer. All thanks to this book. "It was not an ordinary night at our house." "The rain was pouring heavily." "Like thousands of pebbles dropped from the sky." "Under my mother's warm armpit, I asked." "Is God angry at us, Mother?" "Since I saw my father's lifeless body swaying, the sea was no longer the same." "To my skin and eyes, the sand was no longer embracing." "The waves no longer raise my spirit." "She closely looked at my face, covered by cheap powder and lipstick." "Her tears rolled and dropped onto my cheek." "Who taught you to wear makeup like this?" "Concealing the freshness of your cheeks and the innocence of your eyes." "I stood tall and stared ahead." "Even without him…" "I always feel that he's here." "Supporting my feet and reinforcing my fingers." "To leap further." Thank you. Samir! Samir! Samir! Samir! Samir! Layla. Layla. Let's go home. -Sir, thank you. -You're welcome. -May peace be upon you. -And upon you as well, take care. I have to say goodbye to Ilham. Just a minute, all right? Layla. I'm sorry. I know I've disappointed you. I just can't stand watching you make the biggest mistake of your life, Layla. What can I do, Ham? I have to go back. -Yes, but… -Please give this to Samir. Give it to Samir yourself, okay? Please give this to Samir. I'll wait for him at the Maiden Tower. -Now. -Okay, go. Can I buy some souvenirs? We still have some time before our flight. We can still go to the Old City, right? Just a quick stop. You… You've never been to the Old City, right? Why should I? There are lots of boring places like that in Europe. Not really. There are many interesting places you can visit. While I look around for souvenirs. Hey, we don't have time. What's wrong with you? If you want souvenirs, you can buy some at the airport. You don't have to go to the Old City. Unless you have something else to do. Do you want to see Samir? Now it's time for you to fulfill your promises to me. Samir. Samir. Let's go home. Layla won't come, Samir. I have to wait for Layla. Layla has returned to Indonesia. She'll marry someone else. Let's go home. Please take care of my mother. Samir. Samir. Samir. Where are you going? NIZAMI GANJAVI May peace be upon you. -And upon you as well. Layla! -Ma'am. -Mr. Ibnu, welcome. -Sir. -May I talk to you? Please. -Yes. About Layla… I don't want any more problems, can you handle it? All right. Layla! Layla! Layla! PREPARE TO BUILD WITH THE SPIRIT OF UNITY Ma'am, please help my child! My child is sick and needs medication! Ma'am, help us! -Yes, we will. -The media is waiting. -Let's take photos. -I feel bad for her. -Ma'am, please help! -Calm down. -Thank you. -Thank you. Thank you. There's enough for everybody. Here you go, ma'am. Don't forget, vote for me. -Greetings. Good day. -Hello. Is this Narmina's house? -That's right. -There's a letter for her. -Thank you very much. -You're welcome. His last GPS signal was here. This is his phone! -Samir! -Samir! -Samir! -Samir! -Samir! -Samir! Samir! Samir. What are you doing here? What's wrong with you? For Layla… I'm willing to become Majnun. Don't do this, Samir. Leave. -Both of you, leave. -Samir. Layla has helped me so much. Thanks to her, I got a scholarship in Indonesia. Samir, this is from Layla. Before her flight, she left this for you. Please leave. The prayer that I recite One thing I hold in my heart SUMBADRA, FLESH AND BLOOD BY NUR LAYLA MASHABI For my true friend, Samir. Who reopened my door of fantasy and my window of hope. Let it be known to you, that night I opened my window. Which I can no longer close. Don't forget me, Samir. Because I can never forget you. Ms. Layla, I'm sure you're happy, being the future wife of a regent. She's happy. As you can see from her face. Sir, we need answers from Ms. Layla. Let's take a break. Ms. Layla. -Ma'am. -Ma'am. Layla! I think you're exhausted. She's not physically exhausted, but mentally. I need to go home, I have to see my husband. I need to go too. -We haven't served you food. -Take care. It's all right. Don't push yourself. -Thank you. -Yes. Excuse us. Feeling better? I am. I don't want to see more drama like that. All eyes of the public… are looking at us. All of my political opponents are looking for my weakness. Any scandal, even a small one… and they will destroy us. Do you understand? Yes, Ibnu. I'm regretting this, Mother. You did agree. You made a promise to Ibnu. So you have to face it and be strong. And never cry again just because you regret things. Back then, I was the one who asked your father to sail. If I had kept crying, I wouldn't have been able to see you become a great woman like now. Come on, Layla. The car is here. Ibnu has been waiting. Please pray for me, Mother. This is your school, right? Where are my banners and billboards? My campaign rally is tomorrow. How come there's nothing here? Go check now. This is wasting my time. Go check. I'd rather be somewhere else where everything is ready. How come there's nothing here? Wait, Yu. May I ask you what's going on? What's that noise at the mosque? They're having an event, a guest lecturer from Azerbaijan. Based on research by Zaur Aliyev. Islam was first brought to Indonesia by a figure named Ibrahim Malik. in the 14th century. He's known as Syech Maulana Malik Ibrahim. Or also known as Sunan Gresik. One of the Nine Wali. In the… You did agree. You made a promise to Ibnu. So you have to face it and be strong. So… Basically… As fellow Muslims… Layla, he came for you. Layla. La. If Samir is the main character in your book, how will his story end? All stories will end. Does it matter how it ends? SALMA AGAINST THE STORM Where are you going, Layla? I'm going out for a while. Ibnu asked me to keep an eye on you. Uncle, I really have a promise to keep. Liar. Uncle. I have the right to go outside. You have no right over my feelings… Since your father died, I have the right! Especially over things concerning your future. And Ibnu! I have a promise to keep, Uncle! Hey, listen! If you leave, your mother will pay the price. Would you let that happen to your mother? Uncle! Uncle, please open the door! Uncle, please open the door! I have to meet Samir at the bridge tonight, Uncle. Uncle! Uncle, please open it! Be careful. Give my regards to Layla. Yes. Samir, this is from Layla. Read it. FORGET ABOUT ME Apparently… Layla has chosen… a path that guarantees her future. Mr. Ahmadi? Please give my message to Layla. I will still wait for her here. Who are you, asking me for help? Enough, don't bother Layla anymore. You don't know… who you're dealing with. Now it's time for you to decide. Are you sure you want to let me go? If Uncle finds out, he would be furious. Let me handle your uncle. You don't have to worry. Take this with you. A piece of our memory with your father. I've been keeping it because I was sure… that one day, you'd need it. You better keep this kris. You'll need it more than me. Please keep it. Now go, Layla. Go. Layla! Samir! I'm sorry. I didn't get to meet you at the Maiden Tower. Is this what you call a coincidence? The sun appears with your arrival. My world becomes brighter. What's next in this story of Sumbadra? My fantasy hasn't reached that point yet. Fantasize for me, Layla. And I'll wait no matter how long. Write. Continue this story, for me. Yes. I will write for you. Shall we leave this place? I'll follow you wherever you go. Layla. You always lie to me. You want to get married without love at all? There is no love in marriage. Only proper or improper marriage. Then let me go. Because I don't want it. I don't deserve to be your wife. I'm here to choose you. You don't get to say no. I'm pleading you to let me and Layla go. You have guts. To talk like that in front of me. If you want to leave, just leave. There's no need to bring her. I will bring Layla with me. Go leave, now! Don't bring Layla! -Leave! -I don't want this! You know I don't want to be with you! -Stay here. -I'll bring Layla with me. Leave! And don't bring Layla! Ibnu! Get rid of him. Layla! Let her go! Let her go! Bring her here! Come here. Pick that up. Hold still. What's this? What? Please, don't! Ibnu! You fool! How will your people respect you, if you're weak like this? Gun! Nobody insults our family. Especially like this. Show them. Show them that you're a man. No, Ibnu. Don't. Ibnu, enough. Enough, Ibnu. This is all because of you. Don't! Enough, Ibnu. Put the gun down. Ibnu, don't! Move! -Move! -Ibnu! What do we do, Father? Get rid of all witnesses. I don't want this incident exposed. Tie them both! Tie their hands! -Throw them off! -Don't! Let her go! If you two want to be together, -go ahead! -I'll do it! Just hurt me, Ibnu. Not Layla! You two will be legends! Ibnu! All legends will die! Tie them and throw them off! Samir. Forgive me. There is no love in this world… that needs to be forgiven, Layla. There is no love in this world… that is wrong. You don't need to apologize. Samir! Samir, wake up. Samir, don't leave me! How could this happen? Oh, my! How could this happen? Samir. Samir! Samir! It's me. Hey! Sumbadra. I love you so much. I love you too, Layla. Samir! Layla! -Excuse me. -Yes? Ma'am, a postcard for you. -Right. Thank you. -Excuse me. For the special woman in my life. How are you, Mother? I hope you're well there. I'm sorry I can't come home for the next few months. I promise, after my work here is done, I'll make time to come home. Please pray for me. I can't wait to hold you again. Your beloved daughter, Layla. Subtitle translation by: Febianto Rahardjo
