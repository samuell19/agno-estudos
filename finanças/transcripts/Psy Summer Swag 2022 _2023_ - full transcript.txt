And we brought back the SUMMER SWAG show after a three-year hiatus. "Can we do this again? Can we perform again?" I wondered. It felt emotional. Preparing for the show was fun. When I first learned it was back on after three years, I was excited to jump on stage again. It felt like a dream to get to meet big audiences again. I've been performing for nearly 20 years now, but for the past three years, we couldn't perform due to unforeseen circumstances. The production crew was also unable to work. I'd learned that I can't take any of this for granted. Everyone had returned to their rightful place. Me in mine, the crew in theirs. We've learned the value of every moment. This is so much more than a job. Our hearts are full, and we are so grateful. We've done the PSY SUMMER SWAG shows many times, so it was a challenge to put on a show that surpasses what we've already done. One of the things we do… -…is we pour water. -A lot of it. …we pour water on you. We started with four sprinklers, then with each passing year, we added more, and now we have 28 sprinklers. We try our best to make sure water gets to everyone in the audience. We call it a SUMMER SWAG show, but I think it's more a festival. When we think about summer and the SUMMER SWAG show, you think of summer, water, and PSY. People expect to get drenched at the show. Despite the show's four-hour run time, from the first song to the last, people never get exhausted. The audience gives us the energy to go nuts on stage. PSY's concertgoers are called "fanatics." They're not regular fans. They are truly fanatics. They really go nuts. They go insane. They really know how to party. When the artist runs out on the runway, they don't even notice because they're having fun on their own. [PSY] I wouldn't call it concert attendance. It's more like a madhouse. Because they want a night of madness, I think about what more I can do to make them go crazier. That's something I consider when preparing for the show. Every aspect is taken into consideration. Everything pertaining to the performance. The sound, lighting, the LED visuals, the special effects, the fireworks and water distribution. He considers every facet of the production. It's as if he has eyes all over his body. [chuckles] If we're not in line or if we get a move wrong, he pretends not to notice, but he sees it all. He brings our attention to the things we weren't aware of, which motivates us to practice more… [chuckles] …to practice again. He contemplates every detail. He is obsessively meticulous. Honestly, my own meticulous nature torments me. SUMMER SWAG is PSY the performer is in his element and very happy. He focuses solely on enjoying the stage. PSY the producer creates an environment that PSY the performer can fully enjoy. That's why I have to make sure everything is perfect to a T, why I have to check if all the hardware is operating at the right time. So up until the very minute I put myself on stage, I do my best to create a performance stage where PSY the performer can think only about performing. He gives his all for every show. He's sincerely committed and devoted to making the audience happy, from the initial planning of the concert to his performance on stage. [Jang Kabrok] Having to be the producer of his own show is not an easy task. But for PSY, his in-depth knowledge of the nuts and bolts of the production makes it easier for us, especially for special effects. His ability to produce his show truly amazes me. His greatest asset, but his burden at the same time… …may be the fact that he produces and performs all of his songs. Every sound and every performance movement are all laid out in his head, and he has to bring it all to fruition. Not to mention his attention to every detail. Because of his meticulousness, everyone is on their toes, and we all strive to be better. So we've had rehearsals after rehearsals. He still wants more. Others may not even notice but, because it's his show, he wants to make sure nothing is out of place. Watching him makes me think, "He really is passionate." Writing out a cue sheet is like presenting a birthday gift. There's a huge difference between bringing the present visibly and keeping it hidden to add an element of surprise. It gives it more meaning. As performers, we want to catch the fans off guard, by singing an unexpected song or by presenting surprising visuals, so they feel ecstatic. For that reason, the song order, which song comes before which, what plays after which song, matters a lot. So we often edit the cue sheet until the very last minute. Then the respective hardware teams have to edit accordingly, so it's a challenge for them. It's really tough. SUMMER SWAG shows are never easy. Every show is a challenge. PSY of SUMMER SWAG is a tough artist to work with. Because he's such a perfectionist, in order to fulfill his needs, we run multiple rehearsals among ourselves. And when we think we've done enough, his standards are always set way above and beyond what we've done. Living up to his standards of excellence is physically and mentally challenging. Simply put, the annual preparation process is always demanding. We rarely get to sleep. Even after a successful show, he reviews his performances in depth, which makes him an artist who strives to improve the show in every way possible. Today's show is the sixth out of the ten for this summer, so we're exactly halfway through. Still, I plan on making a lot of changes. [sighs] I do feel bad. But as I continue to monitor my past performances, I think of it as a process of improvement. With the sound engineers, band members, and with the dancers during rehearsals, with the lighting crew as we coordinate lighting, with the special effects team as we coordinate timing, with the LED visuals team when making the visuals for each song, the more meticulous I am, the more focused the crew will be, and that's how I bring out their absolute best. The longer we spend on painstakingly tweaking the show, the more fulfilled the performers, including myself, and the crew feel. The more fulfilled we feel, the greater the happiness for the audience. And that's why I work the way I do. It's infuriating. [laughs] But because he's made the impossible possible from way back when, we all have faith that everything will fall into place. We're all in this together to make a great show at the end of the day. If PSY didn't weigh in on the production, it could be easier on us. But the overall quality of the production would noticeably suffer, because every idea or concept comes from PSY, and it's not good enough until he says it is. If PSY doesn't give it his best effort, the show will probably lose its purpose, since he thinks even deeper and pays attention to more detail. After every show, I tell myself countless times, "Should I perform here again, I'm going to outdo the show I just did." I take the end of a show as the starting point for planning and visualizing the next show, and I revisit the parts that need improvement as a producer, even though I know I did my best. So I can guarantee the audience whom I'll meet next year that they'll see an upgraded version of this year's performance. But what I can promise the audience this year is that I'm giving you the very best I can at this point. So what should you do? I ask that you come back next year. You did an amazing job. Seeing you sweat and give it your all from rehearsals until now, I've learned so much. With the same passion, I, too, will keep going. Thank you. Please stay healthy and fit. Stay healthy. Please don't get injured. Please don't get sick. I'm with you until the end. We've got this. Keep writing great songs. Let's keep putting on great shows. Nothing makes me happier than seeing thousands of fans come and make unforgettable memories at this show. As a dancer, what's most rewarding for me is to get the opportunity to perform on your show, and it will forever be a dream come true. Until your very last show, I'll work hard and try my best to be there by your side to the very end. Previously, during a concert, PSY had mentioned to his fans… …that even when he hits 60, he will take the stage in a tuxedo and do the choreography for "Bird". Those words were so memorable. I'd love to see PSY in his 60s and 70s performing "Bird" in his tuxedo. I'd love to be there behind you, playing "Bird". Until the day comes, I'm rooting for you. Until the crowd stops cheering, I hope you'll continue to do what you do best.
