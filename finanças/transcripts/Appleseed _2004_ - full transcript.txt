She moved just as the data predicted. Step aside! The trouble with these sedative rounds is that they leave marks on the body. That's her. We've secured Deunan Knute. She's beautiful. 8 hours, 12 minutes... She's sleeping well. The legendary soldier looks cute when she's asleep. Does she know about your body? Well, she's in for a surprise when she wakes up, when she sees our utopia. Utopia, huh? Olympus AF5, do we have landing clearance yet? Don't get too close till they confirm our ID. Those Mobile Fortress platforms will fill us full of holes otherwise. Olympus AF5, this is... I confirm landing clearance. ES.W.A.T. G2E9, we are preparing to land. Briareos! I'm going to scout around ahead. I'll go with you! You stay here. Relax! I'll be back before you know it! Briareos... I see you ran a thorough check on this one. Just following orders from the Legislature. She's still asleep. I wonder if we gave her the wrong dosage of the anesthesia? One move and I'll snap your neck! Second Platoon Leader Deunan Knute, stand down at once! Briareos? I don't believe it. I don't blame you, but it's true. You're saying that after that massive world war, nobody ended up winning it? Right, and now the former General Administration Agency governs the world from here in Olympus. So, I've been fighting meaningless battle after battle for months, without knowing anything. That's war for you. But it's different here. In Olympus, humanity has finally achieved utopia. Why was I brought here? Because you're an excellent soldier. Your name's at the top of the ES.W.A.T. personnel reinforcement list. My job is to bring chosen soldiers like you from the outside here to Olympus. ES.W.A.T.? I'm sure you have a ton of questions, but get some sleep tonight. We'll pick all this up tomorrow, and I'll show you around the city. I'm sure you're going to like our utopia. The bedroom's in here. It must be ages since you slept in a soft bed. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning at 10. Your name's Hitomi, right? That's right. Have we met before? No, now, goodnight. When did... It was on the North African front. I lost my body there. It's been a year. It's Carl's. A memento of your father, right? Don't let it get confiscated. Call if you need me. Briareos? Any idea who those guys were who attacked me? No. How sad. That attack was your doing, wasn't it, Athena? Money-grubbing mercenaries are surely no threat to ES.W.A.T. Have you forgotten the Bioroid mission? If the military authority finds out, it will play right into General Uranus's hands. He's beyond our control now. And Gaia may be at its limit. Athena, we haven't much time left. ADMINISTRATIVE HOUSE Nike! ADMINISTARATIVE HOUSE We have a leak. I apologize for that. Nike, we need an internal investigation of ES.W.A.T. I'll arrange it at once. Luckily, we averted a total disaster. They didn't find what we were looking for. Then, you mean... Nothing rash was done like forcing a surgical probe. But we can't leave these sparks to smolder forever. Make sure I have Deunan Knute. Yes, ma'am. Humanity is a strange creature, so willing to cage itself. It's an honor to have you come here in person, Colonel Hades. ES.W.A.T. is knocking themselves out chasing a decoy as we speak. We're 98% ready at this moment, sir. Magnificent... We were careful to cover all traces of evidence from these special parts. General Uranus will be pleased. We won't let the Bioroids have their way any longer! Our goal here is to protect the sheep, not the wolves, is it not? Our goal here is to protect the sheep, bot the wolves,is it not? LEGISLATIVE HOUSE First generation bioroids have insufficient constraints. LEGISLATIVE HOUSE Flrst generation Blorolds have insufficient consiralnts. They're the proverbial wolf in sheep's clothing. Whether wolf or sheep, even one victim cannot be allowed. How unfortunate. Gaia has rendered its decision. All the more reason to continue the debate. Now then, let us resume our consultation with Gaia. Deunan! Briareos! Good morning, Deunan! Looks good on you. Get in. Your official immigration papers were finalized this morning. You are now a citizen of Olympus. Beautiful city, isn't it? Considering where I was till yesterday, this is like a mirage. Starting today, it's reality. Everyone seems happy. Because half the population of the city are Bioroids. Bioroids? Artificially-generated humans. You mean clones? Not simple clones. Advanced composite hybrids made with the highest qualities. So, it's just clones who run this city? "Just clones?" Pardon me! I happen to be a Bioroid, too. What? And while we may be made from superior elements, Bioroids don't control humans. Our role is to be a stabilizing force on human society. We act as a sort of buffer between humans. Half are Bioroids... This car seems sort of strange. It has an experimental Damysos system installed. Damysos? In short, a floating car. Live long enough, you'll see everything. They've achieved gravity control through ultra-high frequency oscillation?! And all you do to control it is steer with that wheel? Everything in this city, down to this car, has cyborg senses. The basis of all design here is to make it human-centered. "Simple concepts, complex structures, maximum humanity." Right? What's that? The words from the Central Management Bureau to the Maintenance Department. And there's the symbol of it. Tartaros and Daidalos. The enormous IN Brain inside runs Olympus. IN? Intelligent Network... It's nicknamed Gaia. Gaia is a self-expanding network that monitors everything in Olympus. Particularly us Bioroids. Why? Look, human emotions tend to be unstable, right? Humans are quick to anger and go to war, but Bioroid emotions are suppressed. We don't get jealous or bitter towards other people. That's how we prevent wars from starting. However, at the top of Tartaros is a virus tank called the D-Tank which is guarded by the ultimate security system. They say that if it's ever activated, it would wipe out all the Bioroids. I know it's just the result of the natural human instinct for self preservation, but I find it kind of insulting. Meaning humans are the more likely threat? That's why it's vital we maintain balance between us. So, Gaia maintains a watch on the emotional impact Bioroids have on humans. In other words, it keeps an eye on the humans. You sound like General Uranus. Who? The commander of the Olympus Regular Army. He's an extreme reactionary who hates Bioroids. Doesn't take to utopia, huh? Olympus is run entirely by Bioroids. Prime Minister Athena is one, too. Athena? Athena... You know Prime Minister Athena? I doubt it, but... She's like a president. But humans run the military. Scary, huh? Prime Minister Athena runs ES.W.A.T. under the authority of the Administration. Lately, it's grown into a kind of army itself. It isn't winning her any friends with the regular army. But final decision-making authority over Olympus is entrusted to Gaia. What's wrong? We're being followed. You okay, Hitomi? I think so, but look! Not a terribly friendly-looking bunch. So, are they after me? Definitely. Yup, this is reality, all right. Briareos! The appleseed seal must not be broken. How are you feeling, Elders? Hitomi, you're safe! Are you injured? I'm fine. Anyway, here's the one you've been waiting for: Deunan Knute. As beautiful as rumored. The goddess of war. You definitely have Carl's eyes. You knew my father? Everything about him. Most Bioroids in Olympus carry some of the genes of Colonel Carl Knute. That makes you and Hitomi something like sisters. Anyway, we're sorry to hear you had a terrible experience so soon after arriving here. There's been a lot of resentment towards outsiders lately. They fear the balance of their society has been upset. First of all, let us introduce you to Gaia. There's been some excitement. The Legislature and the Administration are at odds. It's more proof of the growing arrogance of the Bioroids. You're certain Athena is searching for Carl's daughter? No doubt about it. Everything's ready, sir. How reliable is our intelligence? Level 5, sir. Your decision, General? I won't allow humans to become living tools. This is Gaia... Gaia is the self-expanding network which administers Olympus. Debate between Gaia and the Elders here produces the will of Olympus. Gaia is a collection of the wisdom and intentions of the scientists who designed it. But, in the end, a machine is a machine. It's perfectly stable. It doesn't waver at all. In short, it has no feelings or emotions. By adding our seven human souls, we give Gaia its flexibility. Although, lately, you've been disagreeing with it a lot. Our job is to ensure an ongoing dialogue with Gaia. The results of our long discussions set Olympus on the proper path towards the future. Until yesterday, you were on the battlefield, weren't you, Deunan? What were you fighting for? Well... So long as humans continue to have desires, war will never end. That is why we built Olympus. Coexistence between Man and Bioroid is the last hope for Mankind. Gaia monitors that balance. Bioroids are vastly different life forms from humans. Bioroids cannot reproduce, so they can have no descendants. Which means, no sex. And since the emotion of love is controlled, desires are minimized and hatred weakened. However, Bioroids need to undergo a periodic life extension process, or they will age rapidly and die. In order to differentiate Bioroids from humans, we suppressed the reproductive functions and changed their life cycle. Aren't you overdue for a life extension yourself, Hitomi? Don't worry, I'll get it done in the next few days. Someday, I pray you won't have to go through all this trouble. Kudoh, your unit's been wiped out. You're all pretty green. Nothing personal, guys. She started with one knife and killed sixteen men in ten minutes. That's one helluva rookie you've brought me. Proud of yourself? Your life may depend on those men someday. You can show them a little more respect. Is that all you have to say after we've been apart for so long?! Can't you say something nice to me, at least?! Like, "How've you been for the last two years?" Or, "it's great to see you again!" Someone's after you. I know! But why?! Who's behind it?! I don't know. Then what's Appleseed? I don't know. Stop answering me like a machine! I'm sorry... My duty now is to protect you. Your duty? See you tomorrow at 9. Cheers! I never thought you were Deunan Knute, the legendary lady warrior. I heard you were killed in the war. Everyone talks about your exploits in the Conventional War. May I join you? Go ahead. Deunan, about Carl Knute... Where's your father now? He died of an illness before the war. I see... And your mother? I don't remember her at all. Dad never spoke about her. You and Briareos were lovers once, weren't you? That was back when he was still flesh and blood. Looks count for a lot in love, don't they? I didn't say that! What a waste, then. He's still a man inside, you know. Tell me... How does it feel to be in love? What? Remember we told you that feelings of love are controlled in Bioroids? That's why we don't know what it's like to be "in love." I have an abstract understanding of it, but not an emotional one. That's what makes it so fascinating to me. It's one thing I envy in humans. What's it like to be in love? To love somebody... Why, you! How dare you speak to a human that way, Bioroid?! Oh, talking back to me now?! Olympus Regular Army. Oh talking back to me now?! Olympus Regular Army. C'mon,say something else! It's terrible. C'mon,say something else! Humans start shouting so easily. C'mon,say something else! Can't you say anything now?! Operation inspection complete. No problems. Now, to adjust the cockpit seat. I just want to clear up a question first. Why so few cushions or shock absorbers in the tendon sheath? As I explained before, shock is absorbed in the power train. But there are plenty of cartilage units. Magnetic fluid parts are used in the tri-axial joints, the bearings and the fine sensory oscillation control. Don't get too wild out there, or you may dislocate something. You don't need to worry too much about Deunan Knute, Yoshitsune. But you don't usually see women mastering a Landmate like this. Okay, let's adjust the seat so I can operate it. Deunan, Yoshitsune's the best mechanic in Olympus. As far as Landmates are concerned. Right now, he's really into Hecatonchires cyborgs. You gotta let me have a look inside you next time! I'm kinda shy. I'll pass on that. Got it locked down? Y9 um fi[m©n Got It looked down? Yeah,I'm fine. Okay. than. first of all. this Is the starter switch. Start out slow and get used to it. Okay, good. State of emergency! Scramble order! What is it? That's an emergency scramble alarm! Multiple unidentified Landmates have raided the Bioroid Care Center. ES.W.A.T. Units 104, 106, 107! Employ Landmates with D-type load out and get to the scene at once! Repeat, multiple unidentified Landmates have raided the Bioroid Care Center. ES.W.A.T. Units 104, 106, 107! Don't just stand there! Come on! Never mind! I'll go in this! In that?! Deunan! Stop! Here they come... How do I aim? Deunan! Wait! No! Come out of there! Deunan! Briareos! I'm sorry. How could they have done this foolish thing?! All 3rd-gen Bioroids have been destroyed. All original life-extension DNA was lost in the fire as well. They entered from an underground elevator shaft. Then, one by one, they cleared all seven security points. There's no trace that the attackers came from outside of Olympus. Landmate origin is unknown. I never thought they'd go this far. It seems to be our destiny to bear the original sins of mankind. We're out of options now. Seal off the perimeter of Tartaros and Daidalos at once. Don't let anyone near the D-Tank! Yes, ma'am. Convene an emergency assembly at once! I hope Deunan's okay. Hitomi! Could it be?! You're three days past your extension deadline! Hitomi! Hitomi! We haven't identified the Landmates which attacked the Care Center or where they were built. That's the extent of the information about the incident ES.W.A.T. has at this time. I urge all Bioroids to remain calm. We are discussing alternative life extension methods. Above all, do not panic. Prime Minister Athena! Doesn't sealing off Tartaros and Daidalos by ES.W.A.T. exceed your authority? Please understand that this emergency calls for near-martial law conditions. We have a duty to protect Gaia. Not the D-Tank, you mean? To protect Gaia. Ignoring the Olympus Regular Army? I thought it was the best choice. What do you mean?! Are you trying to insult us?! We don't have time to argue this. Ladies and gentlemen, this terrorist act attempted to undermine the basis of Bioroid survival and is a disaster that has rocked Olympus to its foundations. As it now stands, the future for the Bioroid race has been cut off completely. But there remains one way to save them and free Olympus from this crisis. For many hours now, we've discussed the pros and cons of this method with Gaia. And now Gaia has made its decision. Gaia has ordered the restoration of Bioroid reproductive functions. It's my understanding that the technology to restore their reproductive functions vanished when its inventor, Dr. Gilliam destroyed the original data. Correct, General Uranus. It would be impossible, if that original data had truly been destroyed. However, we have learned that the data, which we have named "Appleseed," does still exist. We are close to recovering this long lost Appleseed. Once we do, we'll restore Bioroid reproductive capabilities and evolve them into a new race of man to create a new paradise! Hitomi! Don't worry, she's just sleeping. Can you really save her? If we find the lost Appleseed data. And if you don't? Then, she'll begin to age rapidly and die within 24 hours. It's not just Hitomi. That's the fate awaiting all of us Bioroids. I'm Prime Minister Athena Areios. You must be Deunan Knute. Deunan, have you heard of Dr. Gilliam? No. We've been conducting research for twenty years now, and have yet to surpass the late Dr. Gilliam's achievements. But if we can acquire the Appleseed data that Dr. Gilliam developed, Bioroids will regain the ability to reproduce. They'll be freed from the fear of the D-Tank, and become a new, eternal race of mankind. Gaia has made its decision. Now then, Athena... It's time you made yours. Deunan, we need your help. This old disk is our only clue. So, we're headed for the lab where the first Bioroid was created? That's what they told me. So, why has Prime Minister Athena kept the disk secret all this time? And why did Dr. Gilliam seal away the data on Bioroid reproduction? Deunan, this is a highly classified and dangerous mission. If focusing ourselves on achieving it will save Hitomi's life, isn't that enough? Don't distract yourself with anything else. Can I ask one more question? Sure. That last shot you fired at the terrorists, was it... No... Never mind, forget it. Deunan! Leyton! Over here! This definitely looks like it. Kudoh, step back. Dr. Gilliam, there's no time! You have to get out of here! Just a little longer, Athena. I have to destroy this. We're holding them off on the first floor. Just hurry! Mommy! What's wrong? Did we wake you? My God... What is it, Deunan? Mother... Deunan, listen carefully. Mommy has recorded some very important research data in this pendant. But some bad people want to use it to do bad things. That's why I'm hiding it in this. Bad people? Right. Bad people who want to take your future away from you. That's why I'm giving you this pendant to protect. Okay, I'll protect it. Good girl. But Deunan, if Athena ever asks for the pendant, I want you to give it to her. Athena is special. I understand, Athena is special. Deunan, protect the Appleseed. I guess you know now, Deunan. Have you remembered where the data is? Carl's gun... The Appleseed data is in that pendant, right? You must be Dr. Gilliam. I'll have to ask you not to move, please. Don't move... For God's sake, please don't move! Mommy? What's wrong, Mommy? Deunan! Stay out! Don't shoot! Mother... Damn, it's the Olympus Army. When did they get here?! How did they know about this place? There's lots of them. They have the downstairs secured already. There's only one way to the roof. We'll ambush them there! Whoops, nobody move, please. We're on the fifth floor, Lab D. Leyton, you! You traitor! I've always hated the Bioroids. Besides, the real traitor is right there. Hades! Deunan! It's been a long time. I only wish I could have killed Carl myself! Yeah, you stink of the Bioroids. It brings tears to my eyes to see you still hang out with your boyfriend, even though he's nothing but a machine now! I got fed up with those old fossils and their little terrorist farce. But you trusted your subordinates a little too much, and that's the oldest mistake in the book, Briareos. Briareos, what's he talking about? I'll tell you, Deunan. It was Briareos who was behind the Care Center attack. You saw how he let my Landmate escape during the attack, didn't you? Thanks to him, every Bioroid is going to die! Is this true? Answer her, you Legislature Iapdogl Now, hand over that pendant. Deunan! Get to the roof! Hurry! Kudoh! Go! Kudohl Stay back! Don't come any closer! Deunan, give me the pendant! You'll be safe if you do! My mom gave her life to protect this! You knew from the start, didn't you? You knew everything! Deunan... Deunan! Now you see what kind of monster he truly is! Deunan Knute! I'm Edward Uranus III, commander of the Olympus Regular Army. I'm a former comrade of Carl Knute and I knew Dr. Gilliam very well. We met many times when you were small. We don't wish to harm you. We just want to see that data destroyed. We're going to occupy the Legislature, destroy the D-Tank and all the Bioroids. Once again, human society will be returned to human hands. But that data threatens our coup. Will you hand it over quietly? I refuse. Deunan! Deunan, Olympus is no longer the utopia that Carl and Dr. Gilliam dreamt of! All that my father Carl taught me to do was how to fight. But only now do I understand why he forged me into the battle machine I am today. General, as my mother instructed, I will hand this data over to Athena only! You can't trust the Bioroids! They want to control mankind! Maybe you're right. Maybe I can't trust them. But one thing I know for sure... Bioroids don't kill other Bioroids! General, you're wasting your time. Deunan... What a shame. Athena is trying to protect human society! Carl and Dr. Gilliam died hiding the Appleseed data to protect human society! They both feared what might happen when the Bioroids were activated. Because Bioroids represent a threat! No! Athena honored Dr. Gilliam's wishes, and refused to fully activate their reproductive abilities. General! Bioroids are here to safeguard human society. I cooperated with Hades in that terrorist attack only to force Athena to fully activate the Bioroids. She kept hidden the key to revive the memories in you that the trauma had erased. My duty was to deliver Appleseed to the Elders. And in return, they would guarantee your safety. All the more reason we must destroy that pendant! General, don't you see something wrong with all this?! The Elders don't just want the Appleseed data! They need a coup. They want to destroy the D-Tank! There must be a reason why Athena is so desperate to protect it. General, the D-Tank must not be destroyed! Briareos! I won't let some damned machine try to confuse us! This is vengeance, Deunan! You can't imagine the miserable days I suffered through after your father kicked me out of L.A. S.W.A.T., Deunan! This is my revenge for Carl kicking me off the force! Even the fact that his DNA is inside them makes me sick! I'm going to kill every last Bioroid! Hades! Deunan, if you want to hate someone, hate your father! Forgive me... Don't speak. It hurts when I get shot, even if I am the latest in cyborgs. Please, don't talk! I missed you. As I lay dying on the battlefield, all I wanted was to see you again. The Elders saved me. I didn't care about anything else, only your safety. I know that now! And now I'm a monster, in body and soul. You haven't changed at all! You're the same! But now I can no longer protect you. I won't let you die! Deunan, the Elders... Briareos! The Elders promised there would be no loss of human life, but something else is going on. That's why you have to go! I can't leave you! The future of this world is at stake! Why does the future matter if you're not in it?! Deunan... Don't let your mother's death be in vain! Stop trying to talk! Deunan! Briareos? Briareos! Briareos sent an SOS signal on a secret line just after he was shot! These Hecatonchires units are built like nothing else. His system shut down in time. I may still be able to save him. Save him! Please! It's got a full tank, so don't worry about that. The Landmate Damysos system was only recently put into general use, but you'll find it surprisingly stable in flight. It's a little top-heavy, but it shouldn't affect turns less than 60 degrees. Deunan... Bioroids may not feel it as strongly as humans, but we do feel love. Save Hitomi. Deunan Knute, mission accomplished. Good work. Deunan... Deunan, well done! We've already perfected the Bioroid reproduction function! Hitomi's life support cycle is becoming like that of a human. Now she will be saved. Thank goodness... There's nothing to worry about anymore. Deunan? Was it you people who killed my mother? You killed her, didn't you? Forgive us, Deunan. It really was an accident. Had she been alive, we might have had other options. Why did my mother have to hide the Appleseed data? She gave us a glimmer of hope. A final chance for our human race to survive. That hope lay in human and Bioroid coexistence. And still, mankind didn't stop fighting. Nor did its fear and hatred of alien races. It is about to overflow with anger and hatred. Humanity no longer has the ability to maintain this world. And it's ignored Dr. Gilliam's vision. Gaia has made an accurate prediction that the human race is doomed to destroy itself and the world in three generations. Deunan... the time has come for us, the human race, to step aside. Step aside? We must relinquish the Earth's future to the Bioroids. The virus that Dr. Gilliam developed will finally serve its intended mission. The virus my mother developed? Yes, the virus sealed in the D-Tank, which has been sealed atop Tartaros all these years. That virus... will render humans completely infertile! Not one human life will be taken. Instead, we will slowly close the book on human history. A mercy killing for the human race. My mother opposed you. She refused to fully activate Bioroid reproduction, so you killed her! The Olympus plan had two options. Coexistence with the Bioroids or the transition to a new race. Gaia was built to render a fair and precise decision. Dr. Gilliam contributed greatly to its creation. Gaia certainly inherited your mother's wish. The virus cannot be activated without Gaia's consent. But mankind once again started a global war and reduced the world to ruins. And even Olympus, which was intended to control the world, is threatened as well. The hatred of Bioroids which General Uranus's group showed fueled Gaia's anger. Thus, Gaia rendered its decision to use the Appleseed to create a new race from the Bioroids, and for humanity to vanish from the planet. You used us. I was the bait for you to use Briareos. It was all done to force Gaia's decision! All to deceive Gaia! It is mankind's destiny, Deunan! When I press this button, the D-tank atop Tartaros will detonate and release the virus, which will envelop the Earth. Hold it, Old Man! Cut power to 9A4G. That button is now inactive. What are you doing, Athena? Have you forgotten that Bioroids were made to ensure mankind's survival? Bioroids aren't programmed to disobey humans, either. We're no longer Bioroid. Please call us the new race of man. Athena, this is Gaia's wish. Its anger at Uranus' revolt and punishment for mankind's sins... General Uranus has abandoned his plans for a coup and has just requested a reconciliation. The General did? I'm sure Gaia knows about it. Deunan, Gaia's will is not present in this room. It's not? If it were, it would have reversed the Elder's decision, since the humans' hatred of the Bioroids has weakened. They shut Gaia down and have been acting on their own. Impressive, Athena. The new race of man is, indeed, magnificent! But shutting down Gaia will have a terrible effect on your life support systems, won't it? Correct, we intend to perish with mankind. The Mobile Fortress platforms! The... The Mobile Fortress platforms have all activated and are marching en masse towards the center of Olympus! They're heading for the top of Tartaros! No one can stop them now. To all ES.W.A.T. Units! Equip all Landmates with Damysos systems and attack from all directions! You have to stop them, no matter what! The D-Tank security system is perfect, right? Hypothetically, a pointblank shot from the main guns on a Mobile Fortress could penetrate it. The ultimate sword versus the perfect shield. Such is the tragedy of those who cling to power! At current speed, they will reach Tartaros in fifteen minutes. Can we evacuate the civilians? The police are trying as hard as they can! can we evacuate the civilians? The police are trying as hard as they can! That's top priority. Once they're in an unpopulated area, we can launch an all-out attack Platform 7 Is the control node for all the other Mobile Forlresses. Hitomi! Hitomi? Forgive me, Elders. If someone can disable the control box on the frontal cortex of Platform 7, it will shut them all down. You can't just destroy it! Platform 7 has to be shut down manually. The shutdown password is "HITOMI." Briareos! I kept my promise, Deunan! Come on, Deunan! Jump! It's too late! Mankind is doomed to destroy the Earth! Deunan! Eden has been lost to us! So, you'd let it all end with us passing on our sins to the new race? Even if we've lost Eden, we have to try to survive! To try and grasp the future ourselves! Deunan! No good! There's no blind spot! Platforms are now 2,000 meters from Tartaros! Our weapons are having no effect. Commander Lance, I'm going to jump onto Platform 7. Cover me! Which one's Platform 7? The one in the middle. Flank Platforms 6 and 8 and aim for the legs! What about Platform 5 in front? Forget it! Concentrate all fire on Platforms 6 and 8! Platform 6 is down! Good! What about Platform 8? There it is. I'll distract it. Go in low from its feet! Gotcha! Briareos! Deunan! A platform has reached Tartaros! It's starting to climb it! Deunan, we're running out of time! Three platforms are near the D- Tank! We can't hold them off any longer! Why?! What's wrong?! Briareos! Deunan, let go! Like hell I am! Hurry! Input the password! Mother... They've stopped... All platforms have shut down! The D-Tank is secure! Briareos! Deunan! Hitomi! Ow! owl Are the Elders? I see, but the last letter of the password... It's been left to us. It's all been left to us. Nothing was really changed, in the end. And if nothing does change, perhaps the sins of mankind will only deepen. But I will fight on. For our children's sake. For the true "new race of man."
