[MALE NARRATOR] The most lucrative faces of crime are divided into three parts. Narcotics, gambling and prostitution. All three are under the control of one organization, a huge octopus called the syndicate, whose dirty tentacles reach into every dark and corrupt corner of the country. But the most difficult for law enforcement agencies to police is the racket involving women, because it operates under many names and many camouflauges. - Who's the girl, Muggsey? - Well, hello, Sergeant. [STAMMERING] She's just some gal I met on the bus. Good-bye, honey, it was nice meeting you. I'll see you around sometime. Sergeant Brandon, Vice Squad. My partner, Sergeant Dunton. Where are you from, miss? Dallas, why? You know what happens to transporters, Muggsey? Transporters? What are you talking about? We just met on the bus. What is this? Transporting a female you're not married to across a state line is a federal offense. Now listen, you. I'm a respectable model. Here. If you don't believe it just take a look. Better close it. You're liable to catch cold. Who are you bringing her in for, Muggsey? I tell you, Sergeant, you got this all wrong. Ain't he, doll? All right, Muggsey, I'm gonna give you a break. Tell us whose payroll you're on and we'll forget it's a federal rap. I don't know what you're talking about. I'll tell you what I'm talking about. The five years you're gonna get. And your protection won't do you any good with the federal boys, you know that. Well, what do you say? - He'll kill me. - Who will? I can't! I can't! I guess we might as well take him down to the Federal Bureau, let... Wait. If I spill, will you keep it quiet long enough for me to put some distance behind me? You got a deal. But what do I do? Put him in the car. I'll buy her a ticket back home. Where she belongs. How do you know? You ain't never seen my home. [QUIETLY] Go on, get out of here. Run. Go on! Run! Stop! Slug made a break for it. I hollered at him to stop but I guess he was just too scared. All right, folks, let's clear out of here. Come on. BRANDON: For a couple of minutes I thought we had the inside on all these broads flooding this town. If only the poor jerk hadn't decided to make a run for it. Ah, we should've known he'd be too scared to spill. Aren't they all? Do you ever try and figure how many blanks we've drawn? Every time we think we've come up with something, we wind up right back where we started. Staring at a blank wall. Vince Malone's a smart operator. If it is Malone. It's gotta be Malone. He's behind every other big operation in this town. Gambling, numbers, dope. You name it and he's got his dirty finger in it. Chief. He's come up with a new racket that will knock your head off. What's that? Public relations girls. What? These are broads Malone farms out to businessmen or entertain out-of-town buyers. Some of the big corporations put these broads under yearly contract. Pay them $25,000 or more. [SNIGGERS] Always some new angle. With an operation as big as Malone's, we can't even get a line on him. I think maybe this new racket might give me something. I'm going to try shaking down one of his phony model agencies. Okay. Stay with it. Can I see him? It's important. Eddie would like to see you, Mr. Malone. - He says it's important. - Send him in. - Muggsey was just killed. - What? - Muggsey? - Yeah, he was one of our transporters. He was caught by two V-men bringing in a trick from Dallas. They threw a scare in him and he was gonna talk. One of the V-men shot him. Well, that doesn't make sense. The V-man that shot him was a cop, Ben Dunton. He's on our payroll. Now it makes sense. What happened to the broad? She was shipped back home. By that cop that's been giving us all the trouble. Brandon? - You tried to reach him? - Sure, I had one of our boys make a contact. And? Brandon worked him over. Told him if he ever came around again he'd finish the job. Every week I pay out a fortune for protection. To make sure there will be no trouble with any of my operations. So what happens. One lousy cheap cop that I can put in my pocket with small change starts giving me headaches. Always there's some fly in the ointment. This Brandon is one fly that I'd like to step on. Don't be so fast to step on people. Especially cops. - Phil? - Yeah. I want you to get in touch with Marty in Detroit. - Tell him to send me a girl here for a job. - Any, uh, particular girl? One of his best. She has to look sharp and have something up here. - Otherwise she's no good to me. - Okay. NARRATOR: Five days later, the girl selected by the Detroit branch of the crime syndicate arrived. I'm Carol Hudson. I just got in from Detroit. Oh yes, we've been expecting you. NARRATOR: Waiting for her at a new agency which had been set up to serve as a trap for Sergeant Brandon was Vince Malone. Miss Hudson, from Detroit. You Mr. Malone? One of my boys, Phil Evans. Marty told me you had a job for me here. - Get up. - Huh? Get up. Now walk. Now walk away. What do you think? I think it's too good for a cop. All right. Sit down. Did I pass? My thermometer just broke. What do you want me for? - Leaving yourself wide open... - Shut up, Phil! We want you to take care of a cop. - Take care of a... - You'll frame him. Oh. Look, Mr. Malone. I've been in the business a couple years now and I've always managed to stay out of trouble. I'd like to keep it that way. Now, you just listen to me and there will be no trouble. Do you know anything about me? - Oh, I've heard a lot about you in Detroit, Mr. Malone. - Good. Then you should know that all my girls are well-protected. It costs me, but it's worth it. To me and to them. Nobody pushes them around. What's in it for me? This frame is very important to me. You pull it off and I'll take good care of you. Better than you ever did with Marty. Okay, Mr. Malone. I take care of the cop, you take care of me. Phil. Go with her over to the place you got for her. You'll hear from me when I'm ready. Okay, baby, let's go. Great decorating job. Probably early skid row. You're supposed to be a hard-working model who just got into town and is punching for a buck. I stashed this in here when I rented the joint. I thought maybe a bottle might come in handy. You've got big ideas, haven't you? - Haven't you? - Not for you, sonny. Out. I got nowhere to go. I said out! I didn't hear Malone say this was part of the deal. Time to make it a part. Sort of like a bonus. Sonny, you couldn't afford my kind of bonus. Okay, let's cut out this Amateur Night in Dixie stuff. Yeah, well, we'll cut it and auditions. I gave one for Malone. I passed. I'm not giving anymore. So get out of here before I call Malone. Just what are you holding out for? I was hired to get a cop out of Malone's hair. Not to get you out of mine. Now blow, sonny. NARRATOR: Malone knew that Sergeant Brandon was conducting an undercover investigation in an effort to identify the model agencies run by the syndicate. He also knew that it was just a matter of time before Brandon would come to the Star Model Agency. Go here at 5:00. When Brandon did arrive, Malone's men were ready and the trap was set. Yes, sir? I'm a photographer. I need a model for some art studies I'm doing. Well, you're lucky, we have a new girl. She's not too experienced but she's willing to learn. Because of that the rate will only be $25 an hour. This is her photo. As you see she's 36-22-36. Well, she looks like just what I need. Could she come up tonight about 8:00? I'm sure she can. Name and address, please. Uh, James Harper. That's room 402. Hastings Hotel. That's just off 9th. - All right. Carol will be there at 8:00. - Good. Oh, and we take the money in advance, please. Oh, yes. $25 you said? SECRETARY: Thank you. - And call anytime. - Sure. NARRATOR: Brandon had taken the bait. Evans immediately phoned Vince Malone to tell him that the frame was in progress. Hoping to secure evidence against the prostitution racket run by the syndicate, Sergeant Brandon, posing as a photographer, kept his rendezvous with Carol Hudson in room 402 at the Hastings Hotel. He has no way of knowing that the girl was there to frame him. - I'm ready for you. - I can see that. Say, you really know what you're doing, don't you? My profession. You know, there were a couple of times that some of the fellas I posed for didn't even have film in their cameras. I guess you meet all types in your business, huh? How do you want me? What have you got in there? Swimsuit and pajamas, you can take your pick. Swimsuit will do fine. Here, you can change in here. I'll only be a minute. Where are you from? DeButte. That's in Iowa. Yeah, I know. [CHUCKLES] Most people don't. They always say, "What's state's that in?" How did you get here? Well, I saw an ad. And I wrote away and they wrote back and well, it's a long story. Say, why is it everybody always wants to know how come I got into this business? Curiosity, I guess. How long you been in town? Just a few days. Will, uh, this do? It'll do. Yeah. Now... Well, now, for the first one, suppose you stand with one knee on the chair. Like this, all right? That's good. Now straighten your leg. Good. Now try it with your hand, left hand up. No, I don't like that. Put it down. And then tip your head up a little. There, that's good. What's the rush? I've only got you for an hour. You got a date afterwards? - Well, no, but... - Neither have I. So let's both relax a little. You got a drink? - Just Scotch. - Well, that'll help. [GIGGLES] Mmm. You know, I like you. Well, thanks but... - The hour will be up pretty soon and... - How about a dance first? Maybe that'll help you to relax. All right. You know, I wouldn't mind spending a couple hours here if I could afford it. Isn't the agency paying? Yes, but I only get half of that $25 you gave them. You have no idea how much money a girl needs in a strange town. - I can imagine. - I'm up to here with all sorts of bills. So, if you could spare a little extra, I could keep it for myself. And the agency wouldn't know a thing about it. And I'd pose for you as long as you wanted. Well, how about $20? Would that be enough? If that's all you can spare. That's all. You're nice. You wanna dance some more? Yeah. Right down to police headquarters. Put your things in, you're sleeping out tonight. - Vice Squad. - So what? Ask a judge. Go in there and put your things on. Go ahead or I'll put them on for you. NARRATOR: A few days later, Sergeant Brandon was summoned to Captain Brennan's office. Sit down. You, uh, know Mr. Marshall from the City Prosecutor's Office. - Certainly. How are you, sir? - Sergeant. That girl you arrested. What's her name? Carol Hudson. What about her? She claims you made advances to her, Sergeant. - Did she? - After which you threatened to book her on a morals charge if she didn't give you $100. Sergeant, that is both extortion and entrapment. Why, that pig. She asked me for money. Can you prove it? Well, no, of course not, but... This is just like all the other cases, you know. All it usually takes is the testimony of the arresting officer. Usually, but not this time. I smelled a rat when she wouldn't plead guilty and pay her fine, like most of them do. - I'm dropping this case. - We can't. Charges of this sort are very serious, Sergeant. I don't know what she's trying to pull, but I am clean. I want to believe that. But the department will have to investigate. It'll be turned over to the Division of Internal Affairs, after which you'll be brought up before the Board. Okay. This will be a big waste of everybody's time. I hope so, Sergeant. For your sake and for ours, I hope so. NARRATOR: The syndicate had done its work well. They had planted legitimate background for Carol Hudson. It withstood the severest questioning. And the girl was proving that the syndicate had not been wrong in selecting her. Then I came out in my swimsuit like he asked me to. All ready to pose for him. Instead he asked me to have a drink with him. Then he asked me to dance. - Did you? - Oh no, sir. I said I was a model, not his girlfriend. That I was up there on business. What did Sergeant Brandon do then? He got very mad. He slapped me. That's when he told me he was with the Vice Squad. And that I better come across with $100 or he'd run me in. Then what did you do? I didn't know what to do. I was almost tempted to pay it. But then I decided I couldn't let him intimidate me. I just couldn't. Or I'd be no better than what he said I'd be accused of. That's when he arrested me. Thank you, that will be all. Will Sergeant Ben Dunton come to the chair? And Whitey told me to wait in the car for him in case he made an arrest. What happened when he brought Miss Hudson down to the car? Did she say anything to you? Yes, sir. I heard her say that she wasn't going to be intimidated by him. Did you hear anything else? Yes, sir. Whitey... That is, Sergeant Brandon, told her to keep her mouth shut if she knew what was good for her. Did you ask Sergeant Brandon anything about this? Yes, sir. - Later when we were alone. - Well, what did he say? He said not to pay attention to her. That she was a dope. And that he'd given her a chance to clear herself but she wouldn't take it. I see. Did anything of this nature ever occur before? Yes, sir. Lots of times. Why didn't you say anything to your superiors about this, Sergeant? I couldn't. Whitey was my friend. Ben, you lying... Sit down. You mean you're gonna let it go just like that? You're letting them make suckers out of you and me. And the whole force! The committee didn't see it that way, Whitey. The evidence said you were guilty. But you know my record. What do you think? Look, I'm a cop. I work for a salary just like any other cop. I'm not being paid to judge you. I asked you a question. What difference does it make what I think. You mean you might get your hands dirty by admitting the truth? - You know better. - And you know that I was railroaded! Okay, Brennan. You keep your hands clean. I won't bother you anymore. - Whitey. - Hello, friend. All right, now you know about me. Yeah. Now I know. Now I know a lot of things. Such as how we got fouled up so many times. How long were you on their payroll? Since we made Vice. Six years! Okay. Look, Ben, so you took their juice. But I was your partner for six years. Your friend! Ben, how could you help them bust me? How? I had no choice. It was either you or me. You mean you were so money hungry that you jumped the fence? You think it's easy to send three boys to college on a cop's salary? And the only other thing that you could do is stick out your hand? Yeah! Now I can't sleep nights. When the phone rings I don't know whether it's headquarters or the organization. They got me caught but good. Like I had a ring through my nose. You know, you could go to the Captain. And clear me. I thought about it. But they'd kill the wife and kids. [SIGHS] If you're thinking of telling the Captain about this... Don't. I'd just deny I said it. I'd tell him you were trying to get even with me for testifying against you. That figures. - Can I go now? - Yeah. You can go. I hope you can sleep nights. [BUZZER RINGS] It's open. -You did a good job. A real good job. -Thanks. I got a proposition for you. I've had propositions before. Not like this one. You, uh, like money, don't you? If I'd wanted glory I'd have joined the WACs. How do you feel about me? Well, you're a big wheel. I respect you. Save that respect for your congressman. That isn't what I mean. Suppose you tell me just what you mean. How would you like to go on my personal payroll? How personal? Well? That's pretty personal. You won't have to float anymore. And the personal payroll? More than you ever saw in Detroit. And you get to keep what you get. You don't have to split with anybody. I guess I ought to feel flattered. Everybody knows that I give for what I get. But you go on my payroll, you don't horse around with anybody else. I buy everything. Including loyalty. That makes us even. I give what I get, too. Yeah, they told me you were sharp. You've got it where it counts. I could use somebody to keep an eye on things where the girls are concerned. How does our deal read? Pleasure and business? I'll pay out for you. Anything else you want to know? - Yes. - What? When do I move out of this crummy joint? [GIGGLES] [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOORBELL RINGS] [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] - Hi, Sis! - Louise! Oh! When you couldn't come back home for my graduation, I decided to come here. Oh, I'm sorry about that, honey. I wanted to but... Oh, I know, you had to stay for that crazy hearing. - How did you know about that? - It was in the papers. Man, that policeman must have been real gone to accuse you of something like that. How did you know where to find me? Oh, your address was in the papers. The desk clerk there told me where to find you. Oh wow, this place is really something! - Do you like it? - Like it? Well, it's just the living end. - How, uh... How long are you planning on staying? - Oh, just a few weeks. A few weeks? Well, it's all right, isn't it? Of course, hon. Of course. It's just that I'll be gone a good part of the day working. Oh, you don't have to worry about me. I can take care of myself. I'll bet you can. Come on. I'll show you where you can put your things. Wow, this pad really swings! - Different from home, huh? - Wow, you're not kidding. You take this side. - Oh wow, are these all yours? - Uh-huh. Gee, they must've cost plenty. Boy, I could really make the kids back home flip with this. You've changed a lot in the two years since I last saw you. Carol, would you teach me how to be a model like you? Forget it. You're going back home. [DOORBELL RINGS] I'll get it. [DOORBELL RINGS] - What do you want? - Some answers. Boy, you must be the highest paid model in the business. I do all right. - Now, would you get... - Well, what have we got here? Some new little trick you're breaking in? Shut your mouth. She's my sister, she just got here today. I'll bet you your little sister is real proud of you. Aren't ya, kid? Who is this man, Carol? He's a detective. Whitey Brandon. I beg your pardon, former detective. Now just a plain ordinary, busted cop. Ya pig! Thanks for busting me. - I'll call the police. - No, no don't. No is right. Tramps don't want anything to do with cops, do they? Your sister only wanted one cop. Me. - You take your hands off of me! - Stop it! - Who was behind that frame-up? - You crazy cop, no one. It was Malone, wasn't it? I don't know what you're talking about. You pig. - You dirty lying little... - Leave her alone! Sure, kid. It's all right I just wanted to find out if she was more scared of me or Malone. Now I know. Get out. Go on, get out! Sure. But you tell Malone I'm not finished. With either of you. [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Don't mind him. He's just blowing his top because I busted him when they testified against him. Well, who is this Malone? I never heard of him. I have to leave on business, honey. I'll get dressed, and why don't you go in and get a little rest, okay? I'll be right back. [DOOR SHUTS] [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOORBELL RINGS] Just a minute! Yes? Is this Carol Hudson's apartment? Yes, it is, but she's not in right now. I'll wait. I work for the same agency she does. Oh, come in, come in. She ought to be right back. How come I haven't seen you before? Oh, I just got in. Aren't you a little young for um... - Who brought you? - Brought me? Don't you think I'm old enough to travel by myself? Yeah, honey. You're old enough. -What made you come to Carol? -Well, why shouldn't I? She's my sister. Your sister? Well, who did you think I was? Well, I... I thought you were one of the, one of the models. Oh. Oh, I wish I were. It must be the dress. It's Carol's. I was just trying it on. Um... - What do you do? - I just graduated from school. Been anyone like you around when I was in school, I wouldn't have played hooky so much. Is it hard to be a model? Mr. uh... Evans. Phil Evans. No. All you need is a good figure. Do you... Do you think that I have a good enough figure? Yep. You got it. Carol must make a lot of money. If I thought I could be as good as she is... - How does Carol feel about it? - Well, I'm not a child any longer. - I'm old enough to do what I want. - [CHUCKLES] Okay. If I ever hear of a spot where they're looking for someone like you, I'll let you know. Gee thanks! I gotta get out of this before Carol gets back. I'll wait around a little while longer. She ought to be back any moment. CAROL: Then he started pushing me around. Slapped me. A real knucklehead. I'll take care of it. It won't happen again. It doesn't both me but with a kid sister around... You don't want her to know the truth, send her home. But how can I, Vince? What excuse can I give? Ah, stop worrying. Kid will know nothing. Hey, get in. I don't want to have to use this. - Hello, Brandon. - Malone. - You know me? - 1935. Finger man for Culatti in Chicago. 1940, syndicate contact man. 1945, fixer... All right, all right. You know me. I don't have to waste time. Sit down. Where did you think it'd get you slapping the Hudson girl around? [CHUCKLES] It got me here, didn't it? Yeah. Malone, you cost me a job. I figure you owed me one. Goes to show you. You live long enough, you see everything. He wouldn't take a fix. Now he wants to work for me. Oh, no. I don't want to work for you, with you. Spell it out. I don't want a hand-out. I want a piece. [CHUCKLES] - You're crazy. - You gave me a reputation, I may as well cash in on it. I know this Vice racket inside out. And I've got contacts, too. Contacts that you'd never get. [CHUCKLES] A lousy, busted cop out of a job. And he talks contacts and a piece. Go on, get out of here. I'm busy. I thought you were smarter than you are, Malone. It's not gonna be as hard breaking you as I thought. Look, cop. Get out. I'll get to you. I'll get to you and your girlfriend. I'm not a cop anymore. I can do things my way now. NARRATOR: That night as Brandon left his apartment, Malone's men were waiting for him. Violence was their answer to the threats he had made. How long do I have to keep this on, Doc? Well, you come back in a week and we'll take another X-ray. I'll be able to tell you better then. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Hello, Whitey. - What are you doing here? - Who did it? What's the difference? You're still keeping your hands clean. Are you going to listen? There's something that doesn't add up to me. - What's that? - Your sister. What about my sister? I'm sorry, Whitey. But I dug into your personal life. I... I had to satisfy myself. You were what? 16? 17? When she killed herself. Ah, what's the difference. How'd she get into the racket? She fell for some pretty boy. A louse. He sold her a bill of goods. And when she wanted to get out it was too late. She couldn't get out. So... She was only 22 then, wasn't she? Is that why you asked for the Vice Squad? I've hated everybody in this racket ever since. Yes, that's what I mean. That's what I couldn't get through my craw. It just didn't add up. Why should anyone like you take juice? I told you it was a frame-up! Are you saying that Ben was in on it, too? Malone was back of it. I proved it. I made him come to me to protect his girl. His girl? The same one who framed me. I roughed her up, figuring that she'd yell for help. You say Malone came to you? I tried to con my way into his set-up in a real big way. He wouldn't go for it. They roughed you up instead, huh? Well, where do you go from here, Whitey? Looks as though I've struck a dead end. If I have to play it alone... Whitey, I want Malone. I want him and his whole dirty bunch. I'd give anything to nail him. Do you have something in mind? It'll take cooperation. You'd have to go to the Commissioner. The Commissioner? - You're asking a lot. - I'll need a lot. NARRATOR: Brandon explained his plan in detail to Captain Brennan. He wanted to make it appear that he had gone into direct competition with Malone. Operating his own phony model agencies with greater influence and protection than Malone had. His object was not only to clear his name, but to weaken Malone's standing in his own organization and make the syndicate bosses come to him. Brennan knew the plan was dangerous, but it did have a chance. He agreed to go along with it. First, Brandon rented offices for his model agencies in several large business buildings. These were to be the agencies set up in direct competition to Malone. Brandon was ready now to begin his drive against the crime syndicate. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGS] I'll get it honey. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Who? - What do you want? - Come up to my apartment in a half an hour. Listen, you be here or I'll come up and drag you out. Sister or no sister. I'm sorry, honey, but I won't be able to have dinner with you tonight. I've got to meet someone on business. Why don't you grab a bite alone and I'll try to be back as soon as I can. - Okay? - Okay. I didn't come up here to drink your liquor, Brandon. What do you want? Come on, have a drink. Sit down. Relax. Carol, I'm gonna do something for you. -Break my arm? -Oh, things change. And so do people. I've gone into business. - What kind of business? - Malone's kind of business. Models, public relations. Girls. You name them, I supply them. For an ex-cop who used to harass the girls... So I played an honest Joe. Where'd it get me? I learned the hard way. But I learned. Why are you telling me all this? Because I need somebody like you. Somebody to manage these chicks I've brought in. Somebody to tip me off about Malone's contacts. I thought you said you were going to do something for me. You stick with Malone, you're gonna get hurt. With me, you'll be protected. And you'll make more money with me then you'll ever make with Malone. So, like I say, I need you. And you need me. You don't need me. You need a headshrinker. Don't say I didn't warn you. All right. Now I'm gonna give you a little warning. If you want to stay alive, don't buck Malone. Last time they only cracked your ribs. Next time they'll crack you're head. If you change your mind, you know where I live. Who does he think he is? He thinks you go into this business like you open a shoe store? You need contacts, protection, lawyers. He says he's got them. Maybe he figures he's gonna scare you into cutting him in. If he even tries to open up, he'll be closed the next day. That's all I give him. Just one day. [PHONE RINGS] Hello. Oh yes, Whitey. - When? - In about a half an hour. She's there now. Yeah, one of my men saw her go in. And remember, you have to make it tough for Malone's lawyer to spring her. Keep her there until I want her out. NARRATOR: In an effort to create the impression that he had greater behind-the-scenes political influence than Malone, Sergeant Brandon had the police start a campaign of raids against the few known racket agencies, closing them down while his remained open. I'm just trying to say that maybe he's not kidding about his protection. I told you once. I don't need you to tell me anything. [BUZZER RINGS] -Yeah? -[ON INTERCOM] There's a Mr. Whitey Brandon calling you. Hello. Hello, Malone. I just thought you'd like to know your Star Model Agency is being closed as of right now. And that's only a starter. Before I'm through with you, you won't have a joint left open. That's enough, Mushy. Drucker. Well, where's Carol? They're holding her without bail as a material witness. What kind of double-talk are you giving me? They're giving it to me in there. I don't care what they're giving you. You're my lawyer. I tell you to get her out, you get her out. It'll take time. Somebody's putting on pressure. Yeah, I know who it is. Listen. I pay you to take care of things for me. It's up to you to figure how. But do it. - Otherwise... - Hey, there's Carol! Who got you out? That ex-cop Whitey Brandon. He got me in and he got me out. Drucker couldn't and he could? He's trying to show me he's got more influence than I have. He must know somebody we don't. He isn't gonna know him for long. Drop me off at the office, Phil. Then you take Carol home. How about me coming up for a drink? Try the nearest bar. I thought you were a smart broad. What do you mean by that? How long do you think Malone's gonna hold out? This whole thing's got him shaky. - I'm sure he'll be able to handle it. - Well, he'd better. The top man will put him out and put somebody else in and it could be me. Is that why I should ask you up for a drink? What am I? Poison or something? You know how I felt about you from the first day you got here. And you know how I felt about you. So we're even. You learn the hard way, don't you. You've got a lot of learning to do yourself. I don't take a pushing around like that from any pig. Then stay away from me and you won't be pushed. Hello, Ben. - I've got to kill you. - Malone? He wants you out of the way. I see. I'm supposed to take you down for questioning. You resisted so I had to kill you. Sweet, isn't it? Yeah. That's perfect. Well, what are you waiting for? Why don't you do it? I can't do it. Not to you. No. We're pals. Whitey, they keep piling it on me. How much more am I supposed to take? Whitey, I can get out of this mess if you'll stop bucking Malone. I'll tell him I scared you into closing up shop. I'm not gonna stop, Ben. You can't beat him. I'm doing it. And I guess I'm doing it real good. Or he wouldn't have sent you. I hate to think... I got you in this lousy racket because I turned you in. It didn't help. It gave me a sour taste... For friends. Whitey, please. Run away. Go anywhere. I'll tell Malone you disappeared. That I couldn't find you. I'm not running, Ben. So I guess you gotta kill me. I can't. You got one other out. You can go to Brennan and clear me. Tell him how you been hooked up with Malone. It's either that or killing me. Take your choice. You think it's gonna end with me? Because it's not. One of these days your wife is gonna get wise to you. And Malone won't care. Captain. This is Sergeant Dunton. I'm sorry to bother you at home. But I have something very important to tell you. Yes, Captain, I'll be right over. I know I'm in no position to give advice, but Whitey, get out of this racket. Sooner or later they'll get you. Either the department or Malone. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Oh yes, this is Louise. Why, of course I remember you, Mr. Evans. Big agency man's coming up to my place. He's looking for someone new and young. Yeah, a teenager. It's for a line of dresses. A magazine layout. So I thought of you. Well, gee, that's terrific, Mr. Evans. Uh-huh, sure. I can come right over. Okay, it's apartment 36, Fairmount. I'll be waiting. Okay, baby. [DOORBELL RINGS] Come in, honey. Come in. - Hi, am I late? - No, early. Advertising man isn't even here yet. Oh good, it'll give the butterflies in my stomach a chance to settle down. Gee, I hope he likes me. Any guy who wouldn't like that kind of stuff hasn't been taking his vitamins. - Carol's dress, huh? - Uh-huh, she isn't home. Yeah. She's with Malone. - Malone? - Yeah. You know, Vince. Vince Malone? Well I've read about him. He's a racketeer. No, naughty, naughty. Carol said she didn't know him. What would she be doing with him? Well, let's put it this way. - They aren't exactly playing Parcheesi. - You're lying. You think so? Ask her. Well, I'm going home. I'm not gonna listen to this. Uh-uh-uh. Stay here. It's bad enough to get the brush from your sister, I'm not gonna take it from some wacky kid. - You're hurting me! - Sure. Maybe it evens the score with Carol. There's nothing to be afraid of, kid, I won't... You gotta grow up sometime. Go away! Let me go! Don't try that again! What's to get so upset about? It's all in the family. Carol and Malone. You and me. Stay away from me! Keep away! [SHRIEKS] [PHONE RINGS] [PHONE RINGS] [PHONE RINGS] Hello? This is Carol Hudson. State Hospital? I'll be right down. Are you her sister? - What happened? - Assault and rape. Carol? Don't stay with her too long. I gave her a sedative. Who did it, honey? Who did it? Phil Evans. - Who? - Phil Evans. Phil. - But how did you two... - He said he wanted to hurt me because I was your sister. He, he told me about you and Malone. I'm sorry, honey. I didn't want you to know. It couldn't have done any good for you to know. - Where's Miss Hudson? - She's inside. Miss Hudson? I'm Captain Brennan. I thought you might know where we can find Phil Evans. - You didn't get him? - No, but we've got an all-points out for him. I want you to get him. I want you to kill him. I heard, Carol. And I'm sorry. They find him yet? - Well, if I can help... - You? What can you do? Phil is one of Malone's boys, isn't he? I can knock them all off if I have your help. How? Get me a list of Malone's agencies. You afraid? All I want is Phil. Not Malone. All I care about is finding him. How's the kid? - How did you know? - Phil told me. Phil told you? Yeah. Came to me for help to duck the cops. Where is he? What's the difference? What's the difference? She's my sister. You know what he did to her? A kid. They're all kids at some time or another. Where is he, Vince? I've got to know. Look, Carol. You know I don't yell copper. - Not in my business. - I've got to find him. Where is he, Vince? Where is he? Cut it. You know nobody in the organization runs to the cops for anything. All I gotta do is yell copper and Marty and Frank and the others cut my head right off. I don't care about you or the organization. Or Marty or Frank or anyone else. The kid'll get over it. She'll go back home. Nobody'll know. She'll know. Isn't that enough? Now you listen to me. Phil knows my operation inside out. I turn on him, he can turn on me. You understand? So you just forget about Phil. You're a smart girl. Stay that way. What happened could happen to anyone. Couple of days, everybody'll forget. Sure. I'll see you tomorrow. [PHONE RINGING] Yes? What made you change your mind? As far as I'm concerned, Malone's no better than Phil. You still want that list of agencies? Okay. I'm ready to get it for you. But I have to get it back in a hurry. Listen, just give us time to photostat it and you'll have it back where you got it from inside of an hour. Kid, thanks. This is gonna kick Malone right in the teeth. NARRATOR: A few days later, three men representing the crime syndicate's executive council flew out for a conference with Malone. They came from Detroit, St. Louis and Chicago. What I want to know is, how did this joker know which were our agencies? That's something I can't figure. I keep the list in a book. It's in the safe, hidden behind this picture. Nobody busted into the safe, and the book is still there. What happened to your protection? I spread juice around like it was water. I thought I had everybody sewed up. I just can't figure it. Seems to me you haven't been able to figure a lot of things lately. Brandon's got a better in than you have. And he's got better protection. He's been doing a pretty good job of squeezing us out. Maybe this is the guy we need. I don't know what you got in mind, but this is my territory here. And I don't split with it. Could be maybe he doesn't want to split it with you. Maybe we better have a talk with this Brandon. Feel him out. Yeah. Get word to him to be here in the morning, 10:00. We'll make it interesting for him. Very interesting. NARRATOR: Later that day, Eddie told Brandon that the top boys from the syndicate were in town and wanted to talk to him. Brandon agreed to the meeting and alerted Captain Brennan. Oh, Miss Hudson. I've got some good news for you. We just picked up Evans, he was hiding over in a motel on the north side. You're gonna throw the book at him. Yes, and we'd like to have you at the trial. You'll be available? You can count on me. I've wanted to clear out but I've just hung around hoping to get a line on Phil. - Now that you've got him... - Don't pull out. Not yet. - Why not? - Come in here with me for a minute. There's someone I'd like you to talk to first. Don't tell me you've got him on your payroll, too. He's got me on his. I think it's safe to let you in on it now after what they did to your sister. I'm working with the Captain. Then your whole set-up's been a routine. Now I know how you were able to top Malone all the way down the line. Right. I wanted you to know. Because I got a chance to put the syndicate out of business for good. But to do it, I'll need your help. That's why I told you not to walk out on Malone now. Well, how do you feel about it? I'd like nothing better than to see the cops catch up with all those creeps. Good, now here's the deal. I've been invited to come to a meeting of the syndicate's top brass tomorrow. - I know. - Can you be there? I can arrange it. Why? There's 10,000 feet of wire on this. Enough to record two hours of what goes on at that meeting. I know they'll search the place to see if it's bugged. But I've got a way for you to get it in there so they won't find it. NARRATOR: Carol Hudson planted the tape recorder in a spot where she knew every word spoken in the office would be recorded by the tiny microphone. Any of you boys like a drink? - The usual. - I pass. - Scotch and soda. - The same. Glad you could come, Whitey. I want you to meet some friends of mine. This is Marty Heffner from Detroit. Frank Burke from St. Louis. And Leo Dempsey from Chicago. And I think you know Carol. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, we met. Eh, don't worry, it ain't bugged. We went over it from top to bottom this morning. - You want a drink, too? - Okay, Carol, wait outside. Brandon, you're trouble. I told Malone I had a big in, he wouldn't listen. So you got a big in with the girls. Bigger than we have now. Is that all you want? - Keep talking. - You're a lone wolf, Brandon. You're strong here, but it's peanuts compared to what we can do for you. What can you fellas do for me I can't do for myself? Look, girls are only one part. We control gambling, juke boxes, dope, and that's where the real money is. What do you need me for? You're a smart operator. We can always find room in the organization for a smart boy. What are you so nervous about? Nothing. I was just wondering how long that meeting was going to last. Why do you care? Just sit down and take it easy. So you say we have everything covered. We'll give you 10% of the gross as your cut-in. Mmm-hmm. All right. What happens to him? Why worry about him? I gave him a chance to cut me and he turned me down. Now I'm turning him down. - I don't want partners. - We're the only partners you'll have to worry about. We'll put him in a spot out West. Make it 15% and you can count me in. Okay. 15%. Let's have a drink on it. Clean out. Carol usually carries some. Hey, wait. Here, have mine. Not my brand. This your brand, Leo? Hey, what is this? You guys bug me? Somebody bugged us. Tell her to come in. Carol? You too, Eddie. I think this belongs to you. All right. Who'd you do it for? Who put you up to it? [CRIES OUT] It was you and him all the time, huh? I'll get it. Give us a couple of minutes to clear out and then take care of her. Once a knucklehead, always a knucklehead. Bring the car around. Hold it! COP: Take him out. [GUNSHOT] - Malone's got the recorder. - We'll get it. You better take care of that arm. What about the others? We grabbed them when they came out but I don't know how long we can hold them. You just play the music on that recorder. You'll find you got enough on it to hold them for a long, long time. Are you all right, Miss Hudson? Yeah. - Thanks. - It's okay. I owed it to you. NARRATOR: Law enforcement agencies now had the evidence the needed to crack down down on the crime syndicate from coast to coast. Because of her cooperation with the police, Carol Hudson was exonerated of any complicity. She was going back to her hometown, where she could start her life over again. She and her sister were forgotten now. But one man remembered to say good-bye.
