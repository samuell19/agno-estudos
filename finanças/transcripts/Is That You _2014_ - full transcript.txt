Testing, one, two, three, testing. - Do I look okay? Yeah, you look great. You look like Marlon Brando. What about the clapboard? You know, like Hollywood? No, we don't have one for a clapboard. - So, you just want me to start? You can just do a clap with your hands. Yeah, you know what, I will do that. - Thank you. - - Okay. You know Herby McKee? You don't know Herby McKee. You young guys today, you know, you never open a book anymore. He said, "If you do what you love, "you'll never work a day in your life." I always wanted to do something else, like another job, another woman, another country. I never did anything. So, hello? Are you shooting? We have a sound problem for some reason. It's not recording sound. 75 years and you want me to do The Road Not Taken. - Dear Rachel, Is that you? I know it's been a while. I'm not sure where you are now, and if this letter will really get to you. All the letters I sent you so far got returned to me. So, is that you? Sometimes, I feel it's better this way. You're much real to me when you are not, just like this movie we liked to watch together. I've written out these directions. Read them carefully so there won't be any mistake. - "Darling." That's me? - Mmm. - "July first, 5 o'clock, "102nd floor, top of the Empire State building." - Yes, that's it right there. Until we meet again, take care of yourself. Two days ago, I got fired from my work as film projectionist in the movie theater. It was an impressive ceremony in front of everyone over there. I got a very exciting compensation, a flight to the U.S. So, I'm flying tomorrow for the first time in my life. I'm going to stay at my brother. You remember Jacob? Who doesn't? - Hey, little brother. How's life? Got fired... They can go to hell. What's that music? Nothing like these songs... Michael brought it. He came back from Israel. Do you know "Birthright"? "Taglit"? He fell in love with the women over there. "What a breast, dad! What a front, dad!" Told him it's from the milk and honey, From the cows at the kibbutz. He got crazy about the army. Golani , dad! I want Golani, dad! Maybe you'll talk to him? Golani is not a Gymboree. Seeing your friends die... Your son was in Israel and you didn't tell me? You told me, "If you don't come to mom's funeral, "I'm through with you." And you didn't come. I couldn't come. I just couldn't. I built everything here with my own hands, I couldn't ruin it all. Sometimes in life... there are dreams that are stronger than you, I couldn't come. I couldn't. Listen to this story! You won't believe it. Sunday? I never work on a Sunday... There's a Knicks game. I never miss the Knicks games. But you know... Papers... taxes... I found myself in the office. Suddenly she came. Wanted to rent a car from me. I look at her and she looks familiar. I tell her "I know you!" What's your name? "Rachel, Rachel Golan." I told her, you were my brother's girlfriend. Thirty, forty years ago... She got excited. "What's going on with him?" Like she still cares. Unbelievable. Weird. - Are you kidding me? No way, telling you. Two weeks ago... Stop the car! What did you tell her? What can I say? We barely talk. You didn't say anything? I said, "happily married, lives in Jerusalem. "Runs a big theater chain". She should "beat" herself. Melanie, I'm with Ronnie. - Ronnie? Is that you? I can't believe it. Oh, how are you? What a woman! Hmm, goodness. - Can you fix him some coffee? - I can, how do you take your coffee, Ronnie? - Two sugar, one sweetener. - Oh, good memory. - I just brought you something small. - Oh! - - Oh, how sweet. Don't. - He's gonna sleep with us for a couple of days. - It it okay? - - That's great. Hey, Michael, come on down here. Shalom, you motherfucker from Golani. I'm planning to go to the army myself. - No, no, no, he will tell you everything about Golani and you'll find him his sweetheart in the Facebook, okay? - You wanna go online to find someone with me? - Not some other woman, his sweetheart. - Oh! - Computer geek. Does he speaks Hebrew? Not really. Some... I Googled Rachel's name and this is what I found. - Hmm, mmm. I mean, judging by her picture, Uncle Ronnie, I'd go visit her, too. - Yeah, me, too. It's not her. You know... There's photoshop... Didn't you just see her? We'll never find her. There's nothing I can't find. - You sure she's white? - It's not her. What about the one without a picture? It says "You have a birthday in two days." That one? - A computer geek. - Told you. Go for it. I was thinking of writing something to her, 'cause you know, we can do that, instead of having to, like, you know-- - No, no, no. Let him, let him. - Stop with your hands... Go on. - No no, stop. Let him. Michael. Dear Rachel, is that you? I know we were not in touch for a very long time but I can't stop thinking of you. And then, you know, here I can finally, like, spice it up a little bit and throw in something like, something creative, like some creative freedom. - Go for it. - Oh yeah, something like... "Your astonishing body "and wonderful nipples "flourish in my heart everyday. - Come on. - Wait... "I just hope we can be together - "even for one night." - Okay. - "And as they say in the old Israeli song," - Yeah. I see you on your way to the Gymnasium. "School" Michael, "School." "School," Michael. - Oh, I gotta finish the letter, so "yours truly, Ronnie." Nice, Poetic. It's a disaster. Cut it out. Let the kid be creative. Listen Michael, it's really nice. I really think it's nice, but if you can, I would... How do you delete? Do a cut and pasta... - Yes. Just, "Is That You?" - "Is that you?" It's just that, that's just that? - Yes, I like it. - "Is that you?", that's it. - - Okay, all right. - "Is that you?", I like it. That's you... Yo... Hendrix. Look at you... You were beautiful. Here's Uri. Yochevet... Tamar... Here's Rachel... I can't believe it... Remember we used to sleep next to each other? you mumbled her name after she left. I'd throw shoes at you so you'll stop. You told me your dream. Always the same dream. You two are standing on a wedding cake, and someone slices right between the two of you. I don't remember. I don't remember that. Cause since Rachel... I am what? Since she left, you graded girls on a "Rachel Scale". Yochevet was seven on "Rachel scale". Sima was six on "Rachel Scale"! Rosie got eight Why Rosie got eight? She is cute but ain't Rachel. Hot, but not Rachel. "That's exactly Rachel", They all looked like Rachel. "Cool Jacob and Ronnie Productions" Your son found her address and gave it to me. You're really doing it, You crazy motherfucker. You saw too many films... She has a birthday in two days. So what? Nothing... Just... Just what? When we were together... we made this funny promise. That no matter what... on her 60th birthday we'd be together. That's Shula. Shula? I always name my cars after women I had sex with. Respect, you know. Remember Shula Ratzabi? Long legs... From Tel Aviv to Nahariya. Nahariya is still ours? You gave it back? We didn't give back anything. With "Shula" everything's computerized. You say "Honk" and it honks. You say "Warm" and it warms you up. Massage, and it pleasures you. Music, and it plays for you. Vacuums... Not to mention directions. Shula, Shula... What about this one? Which one? Lieutenant Bella? Will take you to Alaska. You want her? You were with Bella? Alonso, keys to Bella. Thanks, what is going on? Okay. It's yours. You sure you wanna do it? You were the one saying... Sometimes there are some.... Dreams... That might be against all logic. You just have to make them happen. Thank you! Bye, little brother. I love you, motherfucker. - Can I help you? - Yeah. I'm looking for a Rachel. You know Rachel? Rachel Golan? - Rachel Golan? - Yeah, Rachel. - She lived here about a year and a half ago. They moved away, she and her husband. - Husband? How do you know Rachel? - Ah, me? Ah, we... We're friends. She has birthday and I want to. - Oh, okay, I got it, I got it. Come on in. Yeah, come in, I got something I wanna show you. You see, there are seven women in my life. Each one of them I was happy with, until the next one came along. And then the next one came along and it made me think I'd be happier with her. Then the next one came along and made me think I'd be even happier. Then the next one. So, you see how it goes? - And now what? - Now? I'm alone. What do you say about that? Life is funny, isn't it? Well, anyway... Sir? - No, wait, wait. I think... I think Rachel may have left a forwarding address when she moved, just in case she got some mail. What a woman, I tell you. She used to make the best pancakes in the world. - Coconut, banana and chocolate. - Oh, yeah, chocolate. What a woman. Now I could really have been happy with a woman like that. I know it's here somewhere. Oh, wait, here it is. Yup, Rachel's new address. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Husband? No way... Come on... Uh, oh. Apollo Control to Major Tom. Houston, we have a problem. Can I help you? I'm just an auto mechanic for three years. You need help. - You know how to fix this? - Yeah, I know I don't look it or anything. I mean, I haven't done it three years but I think I can help you. I'll strike a deal with you. I interview you for my film, I will fix your lemon. - No, thank you. - I'm making a film about regrets. It's called The Road Not taken. Look straight ahead. - Name? - - Ronnie. - Married? - Is this important? This HDD? Yes, it is, as a matter of fact. I really like Super 8, but you know, the past should stay in the past. - Yeah, the past should stay in the past. Where are you from? - Me? Israel. Do you have kids? - I don't know why it's important for you. Why isn't it important? - You're doing about regrets. Excuse me, but if you wanna go to where you wanna go to, you're gonna have to give me a little bit more than that. - I'm going to find the woman that I didn't see for more than 30, no, almost 40 years. Yeah, yeah. Tell me more. Come on, I don't have much tape left, you know. - Her name was Rachel. Leave it, okay? - You know what? Okay, I need you to give me your most beautiful face. - What? What do you need a beautiful face for? Give me a very pretty face, come on. Hmm, my poker face. - Now your most ugly face. - But that's stupid. - Hey, don't tell me what's stupid in my film, okay? Ugly face. You know what, I'm gonna help you find her. Just give me one second, okay? Okay, look, climb in. I'll take you to Rachel. - Wow, where did you get this? Come on. So tell me more about that Rachel of yours. - What there is to tell, I told you already. - How's sex? - Tsk, come on, stop it. What's wrong with you? Or what's the first thing you're gonna tell her when you see her? - I don't know, actually. I have to decide, I need to decide. I don't know. Are you gonna kiss? How do old people kiss anyway? Do you, like, take your teeth off? What's with all these questions? This is how you think you're gonna make a movie? Let me ask me one couple of questions, okay? Sure, ask me anything you want. Want to know what you're doing, what you do for a living. I'm a film student. I'm gonna make it to Hollywood. You're not going to make it to Hollywood doing a documentary, I can tell you that. - You know a lot of things, don't you? You think like everybody else does. Loser thinking. Imagination creates reality. It doesn't go the other way around. So if I say I'm gonna make it to Hollywood with this film, if I say I'm gonna make a great film, if I say I'm gonna be a great director, that's what it's gonna be. What kind of girl like you has a car like this? I never said it was mine per se. I borrowed it. What do you mean you borrowed it? It's not your car? Is this car stolen? It's my sister's boyfriend's car, relax. Who are you? You know, we're two miles away from that Rachel of yours so just don't worry about it. - You can come with me if you want. - Your support. - Who are you? - I'm looking for Rachel. - Mom. She'll be here in a second. - Yes? - Is it you? - Yes, I suppose it's me. - Yes, I suppose it's her, go on. - No, it's not you. It's fine. - Sorry? You're gonna have to help me out a little. He's looking for his sweetheart from ages ago. - Thank you. - - What's her name? - Rachel. Um, hold on, I'm gonna call her. Honey? Honey? Rachel! - Hello. What's going on? - You didn't tell me you had a boyfriend 30 years ago. Umm. Do we know each other? - I'm looking for Rachel. You don't... Um, I'm not sure that I know you. - Rachel Golan, you're not? - Oh, you know what, someone, - Rachel Golan? - - Oh, yeah. Oh, well, she did live here but - she left. - - Oh! She left the house and she left her husband, too. - She moved away. - Oh! But I think she left a paper with us that has her address on it, just in case she got some mail or something. Come on in, I'll see if I can find it. You must be thirsty, come on in. - You didn't know the town I lived in. It wasn't an especially liberal place. I knew I was living a lie. But I also lived in fear. I was in fear of everyone until I met Rachel. And she took all of that fear out of me. Do I regret anything? You know, I wa... I wasted so many years lying to myself. And I hope everyone finds their own Rachel. - That was great, thank you. Just one more thing, I need you to give me your prettiest face and your ugliest face. It's for the film, this thing I'm doing. Just give me... Bye, have fun. - She left her husband. - It's good for us, right? - You have to move to Canada. I don't know. We'll never find her. - It's not that far out. - Where is it?

What do you mean stopping? - Going to my grandmother's. - What grandmother's? We have seven hours, you told me. We don't have time for this, come on. - Myla-ly, ah hah, oh! Oh, you look so beautiful.

My film is about regrets. - Regrets. - I don't have any regrets yet. I don't think I'm old enough to, you know, do the regrets yet. - I married the wrong woman. I didn't get the real woman that I wanted. And I didn't reach where I wanted to be. I mean, I regret me. - Would you believe we've been together for 60 years? - 60 years? - - 60 years. - 60 years. - Would you like to know our secret? - What secret? - Separate bedrooms. - Separate bedrooms. - Yeah, very separate.

Dan was free on the line, there's three seconds to go, one feet to the right, one feet to the left, I would have made that shot. But instead, I passed it to Dan. His hands are sweaty and he didn't make the shot. If I had made the shot, I could have been in the NBA Hall of Fame. There is not one day in my life that I didn't think, "What if?" You're not shooting on the phone. Good stuff. What happened? Are you worried we're not gonna find Rachel? - No, I think no one worried that I will find her. No, hmm? What will I do then? What will I dream about? When Rachel left, she suddenly was always there, all over the place, everywhere I went. I mean, she was in the kitchen, in the bed, in the theater, on the movie posters, even at fights. And we know that's not right. We have to... We have to stick together, for the family. - Family? - Yeah, I've imagined we have a daughter. - Daughter. - Now you think I'm really fucked up. - What does she look like? Your daughter? - She has pretty eyes, like yours. - Well, I think that if they live in your imagination, they can be made to exist. - No, almost, though.

Really, you know, like my... You know... Really feel like nothing good is ever gonna happen in my life. - What are you talking about? There's nothing that happened. All the good you deserve. - I wish my father were here to say that. Never thought I deserved anything. He didn't even want me in this world. I was a mistake. And my parents would always fight if I'm, that always came up, whose fault it was that I was born. - Wow. What do you mean, in this world? - Do you believe? - - Hmm. - That's their road not taken: what would have happened if annoying little Myla hadn't been born. That's why I'm making the film. And see, maybe muster the courage and go up to him and ask my father straight up, does he regret having me? - Myla? Myla? Myla! Hello, you've reached Jacob Broun Car Rental Company LLC, CEO, President and-- Jacob Broun Car Rental LLC, hi. It's Ronnie. Ronch, is that you? Where are you? Who's looking for me? The police found Lieutenant Bella completely deserted. We didn't know what happened... How are you? That Bella of yours broke down. I took a ride with a crazy gal, she stole all my stuff. Bro... Remember who loves you. Who always saves you. Jacob Broun LLC. Yeeha. Oh my god. Don't say the name of God! You want me to pick you up? How do I look? I call you in a sec... - Where were you? You got some nerve, you know that? You got some nerve. Where were you? Why did you vanish like this on me? - Somebody stole all our shit except for your bag and my camera. I took your wallet to go get you coffee. - Oh, my God. What am I gonna do now? Seventh serving. - All right, go and get dressed. We need to go and see the hotel manager. I promised to make him the star of my film. You can get in his clothes. I have actually had a good life. I was married four times. And even when I was married, a motel is a motel. I have had eight kids and those are just the ones I know about. And after all that, what do I regret? That I did not go out to see the world? The world came to me. I had no need to go find it. And now that when I want it, my body is not up for it. Doctors won't allow it. Where would you go if you could? - Home. Wild, wild west with Clint Eastwood, Clint and me shoulder-to-shoulder, dancing and singing. Thank you. You just burned through the screen. - My greatest regret? Mm-hm. - The one I let get away. The one I didn't marry. She was and is a wonderful woman. She's now a wonderful mother and grandmother, but she's not my wife, and her children are not my children. - I truly regret having walked out on my wife and kids. I thought I deserved better. The real truth was, they did. - If you love somebody who really loves you, don't let them get away. Good, that's great. Thank you. Are you going to be okay with the car at the border? Sure you don't wanna come with me? I don't have my passport with me, so... Well. - Hey, what are you gonna tell Rachel when you see her? - You tell me. - "You're the love of my life. "I've been dreaming about you all this time, "and I fucked up in the past, "but I'm here for you now." Can you say it? Ronnie! I wanna ask you something. Anything. Shoot Rachel for my film. It wouldn't be complete without it. Please. And then you can send it to my house. - Okay, but with one condition, that you go to your parents now, that you'd talk to them, you ask them whatever it is you wanna ask. - Yeah, I don't know about that. - It won't be complete without it. - My film? - Your life. Listen, one day, you want to ask them but there will be nobody to ask. And then you'll be the one regretting. - I'd rather not. - Okay, you don't shoot, I don't shoot. - Wait. Okay. Who's there? Hello? Is that you, Blady? - Hello? Excuse me? - You're not Blady. - No, I'm not Blady. - I thought you were Blady. My heart got a little bit happy. - You're not Rachel, are you? - No, I'm not Rachel. Rachel lives right next door. Everybody gets confused. Everybody thinks she lives here. What a woman. I thought you were Blady. - I thought you were Rachel. - Okay. Yes? Who is it? - Is this the house of Rachel Golan? Yes, may I ask who's asking? - I'm a friend. What kind of friend of Rachel's isn't in the party? - The party? - A surprise party at Twist. Everybody is there. - And why are you not there? - I'm not her friend, I'm just her neighbor. I'm dog-sitting. I need money for my studies. I really wanna be a vet. I feel like animals have better souls than humans. I stopped eating meat. There are actually some good vegetarian restaurants in Canada. - Okay, okay, you know where they are partying? - It's right around the corner. You better get running. - Oh, Rachel, we are so blessed that you have moved back to be with us. You're like a kaleidoscope. You leave no surface unpainted, no substance unmolded. You're like glitter in our lives and we love you. - Rachel, we are so glad that you're here, but I wanna thank you, especially because we've been knowing each other since, what, fifth grade, and we're very glad that you're back. We wanna wish you a happy 60th birthday, and we love you, and welcome back home. - I'm sorry I'm a bit late but I wanted to tell you happy birthday.

And there was something all these moments had in common. In all of them, I wasn't brave enough. In all of them, something stopped me from doing what I really wanted to do. That's why I told your brother I would be happy if you contacted me. You understand? There aren't really two roads diverging in the woods. Hmmp, there are thousands of roads diverging in the woods.
