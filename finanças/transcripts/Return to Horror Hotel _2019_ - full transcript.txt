No, really, Paris. I gotta find your sister right away. (knuckles tapping) - Did you check her room? - [Man] Which one's her room? - [Paris] She shares a room with Carolina. Room 119. - I got a nice quiet room with two beds for $18. - You got anything cheaper? - I got singles for 12, but it's only got one bed. - That'll do. (soft eerie music) - You all gonna sleep piled up in one bed? - Kids like to bunk on the floor, don't you? (soft eerie music) - Ma'am, wouldn't your kids be more comfortable in their own bed? - (chuckles) These kids aren't mine. They're my brothers. We're meeting him in Atlanta. He's been roughnecking out on an oil rig in the Gulf. I can't wait to get these kids off my hands. - Room 333. (Ferd snorts) (Lorelie snores) (man groans) (soft ominous music) (Ferd breathing heavily) (Ferd gagging) (Lorelie snoring) - Until the grass is mowed! (grunts) (man panting) (ominous music) (pills rattling) - Bed bugs. - Go inside. - I'm afraid. - I'm afraid. (sighs) Mario, Abby, just get your whiny butts inside. (ominous music) (Ferd grunting) It's my heart medicine. A bit of wine a day keeps the doctor away. It's fortified. - For and fived? - Shut up, Abby. You are so stupid. I am sick and tired of ridin' around with you little kids. Tonight I am gonna ride around with a couple of grownups. Those boys and girls across the street look like they've got the right idea. (soft ominous music) Might as well get a little buzz going on, save some cash at the bar. Woo! I'll be entertaining on that bed tonight. Runts, stay outta my way. Stinkin' kids, you give me a total migraine. - [Woman] No, sir. - Looks like a fish. (suspenseful music) There's no men in here. This is a dry hole. - [Woman] (chuckles) Men in here? - Lights are killin' me! - [Woman] The paper's not yours, sister. - Mario. - The phone. - Turn off that light. (suspenseful music) (knuckles tapping) - [Man] I'm ready to be tied up, Betty Lou. - [Betty Lou] Four Eyes. You know you're supposed to tie me up first. (man laughs) - [Man] Oh. ♪ Well ya don't have to run, you don't ♪ (knuckles tapping) - [Ferd] Reba, Gizmo? - Yeah, Ferd, can we come in? - I don't know. What you want? - You know, bugs. - I don't know, man, I guess I got some. - Well, like, can we try a little? - You've had your free sample. You know what it does. - Yeah, but Kado hasn't and he wants to try a little. - Somethin' for nothin' because he's a newb? This ain't no charity. You want bugs, you pay for bugs. (Lorelie snoring) - Whoa, that's how it's done? - How many? - Three. - Two. - Gizmo, you printed the front on both sides. - Sorry, Ferd. - One, I guess. Like, how do we know it's the real thing? - You smoke it, you get off, it's the real thing! (snorts) - [Reba] You put it in a real cigarette. - Nobody said anything about cigarettes. I don't smoke. - Well you don't smoke, you don't get off. - No, I guess I'll take it. - It's just ground up bug powder, it's not illegal. - How's it work anyway? - Bed bugs secrete a venom so they can bite you while you're asleep, and that venom is narcotic. Keeps ya from wakin' up. When ya smoke it, the venom gets you high. - Way high. (group laughs) - Hey, hey, hey, there's no smokin' in here. This is a no smokin' room. - No smoking? In here? (Reba and Gizmo laughing) - Outside, all of y'all. Get! (Gizmo grunts) Idiots! (phone rings) - Yeah? - [Jake] There are bed bugs in my room. - [Motel Manager] Not my problem. - It is your problem. - Unh-unh. - Carnivorous cooties are cutting me up while I sleep. They're making my sweat bloody. My sweat is valuable. People pay me for my sweat. Women use it as an aphrodisiac. - I could spot ya some bandages. - I can't go to competition with bandages all over me. Those little vampires are gobbling up all my growth hormones. I've spent a fortune on my roids. - Well, sounds to me like chicken would have been cheaper. That's rude. Ew. (soft suspenseful music) (bugs clicking) (spray can hissing) (Lorelie grunts) - [Lorelie] These bugs are gettin' way bigger. - I noticed that, too. Bugs must be on steroids. - Oh, legs are numb. - Bed bug venom. - You workin' on them bugs? - Duh. Like, I'm the only one around here doin' anything. - I just been so tired lately. Maybe we should skip to every other night. - No can do. Bugs require a fresh supply of blood during their gestation cycle. - Too bad that chicken idea didn't work. - Now who'd have thought some little bugs could kill a full-grown chicken in one day! - Drained it dry. - And I can't pluck a chicken every day. That one pecked the jibbers outta me. - Well I guess we'll have to sacrifice a little to get this business rollin'. - Now I read where some people used a cat. - There's been no cats around here since that Korean restaurant opened up. - Lorelie! (grunts) We need to shave a cat. - Well getting pecked by a chicken is nothing. You just try shavin' some old stray cat. (chuckles) (soft ominous music) (ominous music) - There's monsters here. - I know, they're in the walls. - I'm afraid. - I'll build a fort. They won't bother us there. (crickets chirping) (spray can hissing) - Them people you read about in that magazine, how'd they shave their cat? - Didn't say. Just said that they shaved the cat. (box rattles) And made it a nice bed where it would sleep and feed the bugs. Won't even look like a cat, all shaved like that. (soft ominous music) - (groans) I need to go to the bathroom. - I'll check it out. It's okay, no monsters. - [Miemi] Mario, turn off that dagburn light. (ominous music) (woman screams) - Don't worry, I'll protect you. - [Abby] Okay. - These bugs are way bigger than yesterday. - They are? They are, well. Better profit margin. - You sure they're bed bugs? - They're the real deal. Just means I'm doin' it right. - Sure are big. (suspenseful music) (bugs clicking) Think I'll go stretch out on the bed. Just for a little. - Me, too. Sleepin' on that couch has me wasted. (ominous music) (bugs crunching) (Ferd grunting) I felt that one. (gasps) No, no, no, no, no! (Ferd groaning) Lorelie? (cries out) (Ferd whimpers) Oh, oh. No. (grunting) (soft suspenseful music) - I'm hungry. (wrapper crackling) It's all gone! - I need to make a run for the door. - Please, don't go. - I'm really fast. Just shine them with this. They're scared of the light. (suspenseful music) Aunt Miemi? (dramatic music) Whoa! (suspenseful music) Abby, it's time to go. (soft somber music) (birds chirping) (neon sign zapping) (suspenseful rock music) - I really can't believe you, meeting some strange guy at a fleabag motel like this? If this guy was any kind of a car dealer, he'd meet you at his dealership. - Just drop it, Collette. This guy's got something I want. (knuckles tapping) - Ladies. Miss Grey? - I'm Doreen Grey. - Nice to meet you. Al Sharko. - I can see that. - Okay. Well let's see what you pretty ladies got here. (soft suspenseful music) - Ew. This looks like the honeymoon suite for orangutans. - [Doreen] That's it? That's Marilyn Monroe's charm? - Yep, that's it. - It's just a rotten old piece of wood. - Trust me, that's really it. - What's that supposed to be? - Well, it's real name is Marie Antoinette's Guillotine. - Marionette's Guillotine? You said you had that charm thingy that Marilyn Monroe used to get into Playboy. - (chuckles) She did use it for that. - Would somebody please tell me what's going on? - Your friend is trading a used car for something far more valuable, something that can take her much further than that car ever could. (suspenseful music) This unique relic is all that's left of a guillotine that was used to execute a beautiful French queen in the city of Paris a long time ago. The dark stain on the wood is from where Marie Antoinette's blood gushed when the blade came down and lopped off her pretty little head. Since that time a number of exquisitely beautiful women have worn this charm to give themselves an edge over all other women. - This is what you're trading your car for? Some old stick of wood that's supposed to make you beautiful? - It really does work. I know for a fact that Marilyn Monroe's charm was used by three Miss Global winners. - (chuckles) Marie Antoinette's Guillotine is definitely what you need if you really do want to win a beauty pageant, sure. - I really do want, but how do we know it's the real thing? Like, where did you get it? - A reliable acquaintance of mine, Mr. Stumpy Nixon, acquired it from the Hughes estate collection shortly before it was up for auction. - Well we have to test it to make sure it's the real thing. - Sure, let's take it for a test drive. - Not on me, on her. Put it on Collette. Putting it on me wouldn't prove anything. - Sure, whatever you want. Right on the cut line. That's where it works the best. (chuckles) (magical twinkling music) Whoa. Looks to me like that is exactly what you want. No doubt about it. (suspenseful music) - Take it off. It's mine. Give it to me right now. - What's the hurry? - Take it off this instant. - Hey. Hey, cut it out, I'll get it! I'll get it. Here. You've got it now. - This may seem like a deal as far as you're concerned, but I'm not so sure. Looks to me like I'm gettin' the short end of the stick. - What do you mean the short end of the stick? You called me wanting to trade it for the car. I won fair and square in the SEC Pageant. - Problem here is that you misrepresented that car. You said it was in mint condition. - I beg your pardon, Mr. Sharko. That car is in great condition and you know it. - Yeah, that car is in great condition. - (laughs) Well, let's just say you're gonna need somethin' more than that old car to trade for this valuable item. - How much more do you want? - How 'bout somethin' a little special? - Oh, definitely not. Why do men always have to act like men? - You just happened to be the first pageant girl I called. There's no doubt in my mind that there's someone else out there that would want this valuable merchandise more than you. - Well, wait. Wait! Please, let me try it on. Just let me test drive it. - Right on the cut line. (magical twinkling music) (soft sultry music) - So, big guy, you were wanting a little something extra for this little beaver treat. - Yeah, that'd be so nice. - Mm, how would you like a nice kiss? - Love it. - No, absolutely not. - What's the big deal? - Well, if you're going to do it, you've got to kiss him from across the table. Like, no hugging. - I see what you mean. How 'bout it big guy? You wanna a little kiss from across the table? (soft sultry music) You okay now, big guy? Here are the keys to the car. See ya later, alligator. - See ya later, alligator. (women laughing) - I think you coulda told that guy to take the bus to Oregon and he would've done it. - I think you're right. But, he could snap out of it around Birmingham and come back looking for us. (Collette exhales) I'm going to report the car stolen anyway. I can collect the insurance and buy me a brand new luxury car. This old scrap of timber really doesn't look like much. - I think it's how you position it. (ominous music) Here, let me try it on again and show you. - Excuse me? I traded my car for this miracle charm. It stays with me. - Well, you're gonna have to come up with a different gown. It's gonna look terribly out of place with that little shoulderless thing you picked out. I wonder if you always have to wear it on the cut line for it to work. - Yeah, I wonder if everyone who's ever used it always wore this old thing around their neck. - Maybe you can hold it in your hand. - I'm not going to be able to walk around with it in my hand through the whole competition. - You know, it seems a shame to only use something that powerful just to win a pageant. With your looks you could probably win the contest anyways. I'm the one who could use a little help. Maybe when you're not using it to win beauty pageants you could loan it to me once in a while. - I don't think so. It's mine and it's only meant for me and my needs. - Well you'd still be the owner and all. - Forget it. You won't be using it at all, not ever. - You are such a self-centered prima donna. You know that's why everyone hates you. - I'm beautiful and everyone loves me. You even love me. You said so yourself. - Let me tell you, I've done nothing but work and sacrifice to help you. How can you be so totally ungrateful? You wouldn't be anything without me. - I didn't need your help then, and I don't need it now. I can do quite well without your help. - You have always needed my help, Doreen. - What have you ever done for me that I couldn't have done on my own? - I wax all that monkey hair off your back and thighs every week. If it weren't for me you'd be nothing but a curly-haired chimpanzee in a swimsuit. - You cheap slut. You swore you'd keep my little hair problem buried forever. - Looks like you're gonna need my help to keep this little secret buried, too, Miss Monkey Girl. That little termite trap is stolen, and I'm sure the real owners would love to get it back. - If you tell anyone, you'll be in just as much trouble as me. - I don't think so. I'm not gonna be reporting my car stolen to collect the insurance money. - I haven't done that yet. I guess I could let you use the necklace every once in a while when I don't need it for something. Would ya like to try it on again? Like right now? - Right now? Sure. - Here, let me hook it on.

(soft romantic music) Excuse me. - Well then excuse me, too. - So, is your foot okay? - It's fine. - What's wrong with this foot anyways? - Nothing really. - Why the crutches? - It was just an act to get you to open the door. - Your little act didn't work out so well. You coulda hurt yourself pulling a stunt like that. - I really did hurt myself. - I hope it was worth it. - Got me in to see you. - Well yeah, and now you got a nasty cut, you might even get a black eye. You did all this just to see me. - Yeah, and to get a tip. - A tip? A tip, is that really all you care about? - Well I had to try something. My boss said you don't open the door for anyone. - That's true. I've stayed in here ever since I retired from the Navy. (somber music) (ominous music) - What'd you do in the Navy? - Submarine navigator. - I love submarines, they're so cool. (somber music) - My boat sank. - Your submarine sank? And you survived? - Half the crew survived. Submarines have at least two complete crews. While one crew is at sea on patrol, the second crew is topside. I was in this room when the boat sank. I didn't find out until I showed up for duty at the base. (ominous music) - It musta hit you pretty hard, losing all your friends. (somber music) - Yeah. After that I came here. I retired. Didn't wanna be put with another crew. - When did this happen? - I'm not really sure. It seems like yesterday. I guess I don't keep up with the days. Now I just stay on my regular shift. - Your regular shift? - On the boat, we use an 18-hour day. Each shift is six hours, six hours on, six hours off, six hours in the rack. - Well what about the other six hours in the day? - The Navy discovered that we don't need them. Submariners work better without all those extra hours. - It sounds weird. - It's actually not as weird as it sounds. In fact, it actually works pretty good. Between patrols I always come back to this room and continue on 18-hour days. - So does that nutty clock always run that fast? - No. I thought the thing was broken and stopped running. - Well, it's really goin' now. - [Davey] Yeah. - It just seems so claustrophobic being cooped up here all the time. (ominous music) - Well I like bein' cooped up. Time stops when I'm all cooped up. We pull into port. The hatch opens up and it's always the big jolt. - What jolt? - I hated getting back and finding out about all the things that happened in the world while we were down. Married men getting off the boat expecting to see their wives and discovering they're now divorced. - Did that every happen to you? - My fiancee died while we were on patrol. When we tied up she had been buried for 63 days. - Davie, I'm so sorry. - It was so strange. As far as I was concerned she had just died. Everybody topside already got over it and moved on with their lives. That's when I started staying in here. In the sub I don't think about things on the surface. - You don't get any news while you're underwater? - Nope. The only messages the boat receives are if we need to nuke somebody or destroy the world. The caption and XO are the only ones who read the messages. - Total isolation. (Davie grunts) - I was just readin' my book. I don't wanna know what's happening in the world. As long as I'm in the submarine, the world doesn't change. - I guess not. Nobody in it but you. (ominous music) You're a coward, ya know. You're really just afraid of falling in love and being loved. - I guess I was afraid of falling in love. But now, I think I wouldn't mind. - Oh no you don't, Mr. Jonas. We're not falling in love. I mean, how can you even expect me to be in love with a hermit who never leaves his little motel room? - I can change by simply walking out that door. - Haven't you noticed what's happening to you? What's happening to this room? (mirror cracking) - I do seem to have gotten grayer. - You stopped time somehow. - Time doesn't move. Time doesn't move. - Well, it's moving now. I mean, it might not be that easy to just walk out that door. - You could stay here with me. - [Jonnie Rhey] This room is falling apart. - We can easily build you an extra bunk and you don't look like you eat all that much. - It wouldn't work. I mean, I can't live like a hermit reading the same book every single day, and besides, I eat more than you think I-- - Jonnie! I can change. (metal clattering) I need to leave this room. (suspenseful music) Looks like time's already catching up to me. - I don't know about this. (glass breaking) - Everyone lives on borrowed time. (glass breaking) (Davie grunts) (Davie groans) (church bell rings) - Wait, close the door before it's too late. (Davie groaning) Davie. (somber music) (Davie panting) - There's no time for love. (gasping) (ominous music) - Hold that. (trunk thuds) - Ow! When are you gonna get the trunk lid fixed on our car? - I may never get it fixed. And it's not our car, it's my car, and I may just buy a whole new ride after this deal. Recycle the old lead sled back into the system from whence it came. - Ya know, you could always just let me have it. Like to sweeten up my end of the deal a little bit. - You got to learn to live within your means, T. That old rust bucket still gets by under its own power, which makes it worth at least a hundred bucks. I ain't just gonna give it away. - Oh, well remember you promised me 100 bucks (hand smacks) to watch your back. - Yeah, I won't forget. I don't miss any details. - Yeah, you'll forget if it suits you. - I won't forget your $100. - Ridin' shotgun for you isn't the safest activity I can think of. - Look, T, I've already done all the dirty work. I located the goods and done the breaking and entering. I acquired the merchandise and made the getaway. All you gotta do is be around during the transaction so the buyer doesn't get any funny ideas. (tongue clicks) (ominous music) - Oh, so that's the merchandise, an old box. - It's not the box, you welter brain, it's what's in the box. - What's in the box? - Houdini's hand. - Say what? - Houdini's hand. - Oh! - It's Houdini's old mummified hand. - You mean, like, there's a real dead guy's hand in there? Like, from that old dead magician? - Yeah, somebody cut it off his body after he died. - Well, so what? I mean, who would even want some old dead thing like that? - Lots of people. - Oh, lots, and what would they do with it? - It's got uses. - Huh, what kind of uses? Like, what uses? It's dead! - I tell you I stole it off of Stumpy Nixon? - You mean the one-armed burglar down in Atlanta? You stole that dead hand from Stumpy Nixon? - Yep, sure did. See, he left it in his flat when he went to go visit his girlfriend? When I go pay him a visit, I realize he's left his door unlocked. So I just pop in and lift it. (chuckles) He even left the bag for me to carry it off with. - You stole that hand off of a one-armed burglar. - Yeah, I guess it left him a little shorthanded. (laughs) (Tyrone laughing) - What was Stumpy Nixon usin' that dead hand for? - Well I heard he was usin' it to unlock doors and safes and stuff. I'm tellin' you, this thing is valuable to the right people. - How does he do it? You know, like, how does Stumpy Nixon use an old dead hand to open doors and safes? - Man, I don't know, he just does. He inherited it from some other old dude that was usin' it for the same thing. Somehow they use it. - Have you seen it? - What, the hand? - Yes, the hand. Have you seen the hand? - No, I haven't seen it. It's in a Chinese trickster box. You gotta slide a panel this way and that way. It's like a puzzle. - Nah, nah, nah, nah. It's an ancient combination lock. I used to try to figure these things out. - Yeah. (chuckles) I'm gonna call my fence, Al Sharko. Man, this thing is worth 10K easy. - Yeah, yeah. (phone rattling) (Tyrone's stomach bubbling) (Tyrone grunting) (phone ringing) - Sharko's Body Shop. - [Rufus] Hey, Al, it's Rufus. How's it goin'? - What do you want, Rufus? I'm here with my mother. - (chuckles) Tell your mom I said hi. - My mother despises vermin like you. What do you want? - Man, your mama's smart. Listen, I got somethin' you want. - I doubt it. - Really, Al. I managed to get my hands on something quite valuable. - Ya gonna tell me what it is before I die of old age? - Check this out. I have, in my possession, Houdini's hand. - Are you talkin' about that thing that Stumpy Nixon uses to open safes and stuff? - Yeah, picked it up right out of his flat. Check this out. Stumpy Nixon left his door unlocked. - Stumpy Nixon always leaves his door unlocked. It'd be a waste of time to lock his doors with that hand thing in there. That's what I'm tryin' to tell you, Al. This thing opens stuff. I figured you might know someone who wants it. - Stumpy Nixon might want it, and you'll be lucky if he takes it back without a lotta trouble. - Man, I ain't afraid of that one-armed safe cracker. - Well, you better be plenty worried. Nobody messes with Stumpy Nixon. Even the cops leave that guy alone. Couple years ago a detective got on his trail. He woke up one morning with his nose lopped off. Only a complete imbecile like you would steal Stumpy Nixon's hand. (toilet flushing) - [Rufus] Yo, T, how'd you open the box? - You know that bathroom doesn't have any toilet paper? Left me stranded, high and dry. - [Rufus] The box, T, how'd you open it? - Didn't touch it. I was in the bathroom while you were talkin' to Al. What's that stuff in the box? Doesn't look like a hand to me. - Looks like rock salt. Yeah, that's exactly what it is. It's rock salt. They put it in there to preserve the hand. (tongue smacking) - Yep, that's rock salt. - Man, get that trash can so we can put this in there. - No hand. There isn't anything in that box but rock salt. (phone ringing) - Change your mind? - [Stumpy] You've got my hand. (dramatic music) - Well, did Al Sharko call you? - [Stumpy] No, Al Sharko didn't call me. You were tryin' to sell it to Al, weren't you? - [Rufus] Well-- - [Stumpy] You thought you could just steal my hand and sell it, didn't you? - Well, to be perfectly honest with you, Stumpy-- - [Stumpy] That's Mr. Nixon to you. (suspenseful music) You've never been perfectly honest with anyone in your whole miserable life. You've got my hand, and I want it back with interest. - Okay, Mr. Nixon, I have what you're lookin' for. What's it worth to you? - [Stumpy] What's it worth to me? (laughing) To be perfectly honest with you (laughs) I'll tell you what it's worth to you. The way I see it, you took my hand. I want my hand back and now I want one of yours. - What? (Stumpy laughing) My hand? You're crazy. - [Stumpy] You guys better seriously consider my offer. And remember, I want my hand back and I want one of yours in interest. And listen, Rufus, I'm on my way over there to get it. (dramatic music) - Who was that? Was that Stumpy Nixon? What'd he want? - My hand. Says he wants my hand in interest for takin' his. - How does he expect you to do that? Saw off your own hand? - I guess so. (crowd shouting) - [Woman] Burn the witch! Burn her, burn the witch! (crowd shouting) Burn her, burn her, burn. (ominous music) - You think the hand did that? - [Rufus] I don't know. - You know it's out that box, and it's in this room somewhere. - [Rufus] I don't know, T. I don't think it can think it can do somethin' like that. - It's in here. It just turned on that TV, it's in here ya know. - Come over here and help me move this out so we can look behind it. - Nah, nah, I'm good. - Don't be a wuss, get over here, come on. Ready, on three. - Uh-huh. - One, two, three. Don't pick up your end or anything. - Nothin' back there but old dust bunnies the size of cats. (phone ringing) - [Stumpy] Tyrone Thaddeus. (dramatic music) So you're watchin' Rufus's back for a measly hundred bucks? - Yeah, how'd you know that? - [Stumpy] I know a lot, Tyrone. I know that after Rufus gets through settling up with me, he's not gonna have your measly hundred bucks. Rufus is the one who's gonna come up shorthanded. (laughing) (ominous music) (door rattling) (Tyrone grunting) - Hey, Rufus, the hand just locked us in. - Man, get out the way. Move, get out the way. How'd it do that? - The window. The window's all boarded up. How are we gonna get out now? - We got a bag full of tools. In case you forget, remember we break into places for a living? - Oh yeah. We can get outta here. - Yeah. - All right? Let's go. Hey, Rufus, where's your crowbar? - I lost it. It fell off the roof at the Piggly Wiggly back in the green room. - And you never got another one? - Never needed another one. - 'Til now. - Yeah, 'til now. - [Stumpy] Hey! Hey! I know you hear me. When you shysters gon' stop messin' around? You need to get that hand ready for me because I'm on my way over there to get it. - Okay. - Hey, Rufus. What you gon' do with that saw? Hope you're not thinkin' what I think you're thinkin'. - No, I'm not thinkin' what you think I'm thinkin'. I know one thing, we need to figure out a way to get outta this room before-- (phone receiver clatters) - The hand. It's hangin' around this table. - [Stumpy] Tyrone. Tyrone. Tyrone. I know you hear me, boy. Is that you, boy? - Yes, this is I. - [Stumpy] I've got some good news, Tyrone, and I got some bad news. (suspenseful music) (Stumpy laughs) The good news is I don't have my heart set on takin' Rufus's hand. - That is some good news. - [Stumpy] Yep, and the bad news is your hand will also be satisfactory. (laughs) - Oh, whoa, oh, oh, why my hand? - [Stumpy] Well any hand will do as long as you crooks come up with a hand. You're just fortunate I don't want your arm or your leg. (laughs) - We've gotta get outta here. Looks like they screwed these boards on. They're not pryin' off. Oh, oh. (electricity zapping) Oh, Rufus. (Rufus coughing) Ah, come here. (Rufus coughing) Rufus. You nearly died. You peed your pants and you nearly died. - [Rufus] It's that hand. It's tryin' to kill us. - Yeah it is, it is! It's way back in its box. - [Rufus] Get it, go, get it. Close the lid. - Move out the way. - Get it down. - Ah! - Get somethin' out of this bag. Anything! (phone ringing) What can we use? (Rufus and Tyrone gasping) (Rufus and Tyrone scream) (phone ringing) I can't find anything. (Rufus and Tyrone scream) (Tyrone and Rufus whimper) We need a hand for when Stumpy gets here. - Yeah, we do. (door creaks) - I see you had a little run in with my hand. - Uh-huh. - Tell me, Tyrone, what did you learn from all of this? (suspenseful music) - Don't mess around with Stumpy Nixon. - Let me give you a little bit of advice, Tyrone. Hangin' out with big dummies like Rufus right there, you're gon' end up just like Rufus. - Hey, 'ey, Mr. Nixon. What you want me to do with this? - Ah yes, the interest on my property. I don't think I'll be takin' that today. It's not my color, plus it smells bad. (laughs) Ho! Stumpy Nixon, you better tell somebody. (suspenseful music) (Tyrone laughing) - Woo! (laughs) Oh. (laughs) Oh. (suspenseful music)
