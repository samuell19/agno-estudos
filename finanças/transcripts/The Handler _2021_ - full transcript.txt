Separate, separate. Let's go. All right, cool. You good? Fight. Oh yes. Yes, yes, yes... Harris? Harris. Harris, what the fuck are you still doing here? Man, you gotta go. Hey man. You try to set up an arsenal with a gimp leg, and ten minutes to spare, you bitch. You're already hit? Yeah. Don't worry about it, okay. You have to get outta here now, man. All right, man. Check the cabinet for bandages, all right. All right. Listen. You need anything, you let me know. - I will. Yeah. - Understood? Come here. - Good seeing you. - Be safe, brother. I will, brother. Thank you. Jesse will call you. Hey. Call me if you need anything. All right. Thank you. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Check right. Ryker. - Fuck you. - Don't fucking move. Drop the gun, Ryker. Okay. Get up slow. Don't do anything stupid, Ryker. Walk over there. Walk over there. Put your hands up. Put your fucking hands up! They're up. Where's the bag? - I'm turning around. - Where's the fucking bag? You're not getting the bag. Holy fuck, I am. Come on. Where's the fucking bag? Huh? I swear to God. I see you're upset. I'm not upset. It's in there, okay. Where? Right. Shit! Whooo! Whooo! Fuck. Ryker, listen. You do this tonight, and you're not coming back. We are not coming back. He sent a bunch of people over here last night. You know that don't you? This isn't a fucking game anymore. He wants you to have nothing to do with us. We need to just leave. All of us, just just pack up and go. We have the money to get through. Ryker. Stop bringing the war home with you. It's over. You don't need this. Fuck. Hey, baby. It's me. I'm running a little late, but I should see you soon. I love you. Hey, baby. It's me. I'm running a little late, but I should see you soon. I love you. I love you. Hey, shut the fuck up! Next door neighbor, a fucking mechanic shop. All fucking day, za za za. The mother fuckers. You know what I mean? One of these days I'm gonna fuck up one of these guys. How you doing? You good? You wanted to see me, right? For you. You called me in for that? Why not just handle it like you always have? What's the matter? You don't want to see me? You don't want to say hi? What the fuck? What are we doing, huh? Why else? I want to have a conversation. Your beautiful wife. I told her there's more where that came from. You talked to Jane? Sure I did. And what did you say? Work relationship shit. Goddamn it, Vinnie! That shit's to stay between us. She doesn't need to know what's going on here. Now when I get home, you know what kind of shit you got me into, huh? You better not- - I better? I fucking better? Who the fuck you think you're talking to? Calm the fuck down. You fucking wise guy, in my fucking office. Huh? That's fine. It doesn't matter anyways. We already talked about this, right Vinnie? That was my last job. And then I'm gone, right? The last job? You talking about a last job? That's fucking good. That's good fucking strong shit there. So Jane. She went back to teaching elementary school from high school, with those little kids. She gonna be doing good things. Jane told you that? No, she didn't tell me that. Then how do you know? And Harris. How's his limp? Is he taking his meds? And Jesse. With the whole relapse thing, coming in, coming out. It's gotta be fucking tough, right? Especially after his mom died. When was it? Last Thursday? And your beautiful kid, your beautiful fucking kid. How can we forget about your kid? His birthday's coming up, isn't it? In two weeks, or some shit like that? Yeah, he wanted a blue fire truck. He don't want a red one. He don't like the color red. I don't fucking like the color red. But you wouldn't know that, would you? Mr. Fucking Ryker. I know things, a whole bunch of fucking things. More things about your people than they do. Just like that, I get information. You know why? 'Cause I'm the fucking boss. I'm the fucking thing. I'm the real fucking deal. So. Take this fucking money, and get the fuck out of my office. Get the fuck outta here. How's that for an answer? Keep your fucking money, Vinnie. What the fuck you got me up here for, buddy? This better be good. I'm out. You're out? I'm done, over. What do you mean, man? What are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about? He's got eyes everywhere. He knows about Jane, and Jessie, and you. Me? What the fuck do I have to do with this? You know me? And that's all you did. And that's why I don't give a fuck about that scumbag. Listen, man. I thought you said you couldn't get out. I don't care. When he starts talking personal about my people. And that's it. I don't give a fuck. Oh God. Do you have any idea what he's capable of? Does he know who he's fucking with? God. Look, Ryker. What you need to do is go back and apologize. Look at me. You need to go back and apologize, and hope this blows over, okay? Please trust me. Trust me. We're in it now, brother. What's done is already done. No. It's not, Ryker. It's not done, man. I didn't sign up for this. You know I'm out of this life, okay? You know I can't kill again, man. You know I can't be a part of this life. You hear me? Don't do this. I'm asking you not to do this, please. But he hit first. I need to hit back now, nuclear. Fuck him. Right? Right? All right. All right. All right, all right. Semper Fi, man. I got your back, all right. Thanks. You're my boy. I got you. All right. Anything you need, let me know. So I don't hear from you in six months. And the first thing you say to me is, I think someone's trying to kill me. What the fuck have you been doing? Surviving. I can see that. You still have the guns, right? So that's why you called me, huh? You still have them? Don't ask questions you already know the the answers to. Good. Because I need them. How many? All of them. What are you planning to do? Nothing. Just for protection. It's never just about protection with you, Ryker. You get off on this shit. And what shit is that? Death. Destruction, chaos. All of that kind of shit. No, how are you, or how have you been with your own goddamn sister. It's just, I think I'm in trouble. I need to borrow your fucking guns. Do you see how that could piss me the fuck off? Linn. I don't have time for any of that. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't a - fucking emergency - An emergency. Yeah, yeah. I know. It's always like that with you. You thrive on conflict, Ryker. Always have, always will. If you weren't blood, I would probably be using some of those on you. I believe it. Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Thank you. Yeah. Do me another favor? What? Can you get me another beer? Shut the fuck up. Been working on those kicks? Yeah. All right, let's see. Come on. All right, come on. - I'm getting better, huh? - Yeah. - Oh, come on. Let's go. - Alright. Nice, another. Nice. So why is Jane calling me, huh? I don't know. Why is Jane calling you? What have you been up to? Working. Come on, Ryker. What? Are you gonna tell me? No. Switch. Every time you ask me a dumb ass question, we switch. Asshole. I'm doing what I need to do for my family. And that's it. It's safe. It's what I'm good at. What else is there? Whoo. Getting a little angry, I can see. All right. Nice. Okay. Heard you went out with Lukas. Been working on those hands? Fucking with Lukas, you're gonna need them. There you go. All right. There you go. Boom, boom. There you go, come on. Good. Another one. Yeah, you getting soft? You getting soft on me? Oh. How'd the date go? I'm not gonna fucking tell you. How'd the date go? I'm not gonna fucking. You seeing him again? None of your fucking business. One two, hook. Come on. Oh, okay. Touchy subject? Mmm... Okay. All right. Good. You don't want to talk to me about your dating life? No. Knee. There you go. Knee. - Too high. - You can do it. There you go. Other knee. - Fuck you. - There you go. You like that? It was a good shot. What's in the bag? You'll never find out what's in that bag. You should have put a bullet in my head, like Vinnie would have wanted you to. I'm gonna, right after I fuck you up. You won't. Whoo. That hurt. Shit. No, no, no. Fuck! Shit! Do me a favor. Say hi to your wife. Whoa, mother fucker. No, no. No. No. No. No. Come on, get up. No. How you doing, Miss? - Hi. - Hi. How are you doing? I'm good, thanks. I think you dropped this. Oh. No, that's not mine. You sure? I'm sure. My mistake. Not a problem. Yeah. What is it? I think you should take it anyway. There's more where this came from. And I think your husband, Ryker, would tell you the same. Who are you? How do you know my husband? Ryker? He fucking works for me, okay? And I try to help him out when money's tight a little bit. And I know I don't have to tell you this. Because we both know how hard it is coming back from the VA, don't we? What does he do for you? What does he do for me? That's so much like Ryker, though, isn't it? I mean, I don't know him super well. But I get a sense of feeling he likes to take care of his wife. What about him working for you, would make me happy? I'm just speaking in generality. I'm just saying. Okay. Look, I am not getting any answers from you. So I'm just gonna go now. Just make sure he stays out of trouble. It's funny you say that, because I was gonna tell you to tell him the same fucking thing. What? Look at me. Listen to me very carefully. This Ryker fucking guy has been late a few times, and I don't allow it. We, we don't allow that. You tell him I said that. Look at me. You fucking tell him I said that. Just tell me what he does. I'm a little disappointed in Ryker. Okay. Why? For the fact that he hasn't taught you not to talk to strangers. You have a nice day. You know, you hit like your wife? Actually, no. The bitch hit harder. Jesse. I would've thought after the first 15 times you tried to call me, and I didn't answer, you would've known I don't want to talk to you, man. Ryker, listen. They're coming for me. What? I might not have that voodoo sixth sense power that you do, but a few have been following me ever since you started with your shit. What are they doing? Watching me. They're in the shed now, Ryker. I got home. I'm not leaving, if that's what you're implying, Jesse. I love you man. But you're one dumb mother fucker sometimes. You think Jane would want this shit? Nah. You'd be doing the same thing, if you were me. And I'm kind of at peace with it now. And tell me how this ends. Vinnie dying, or me. I don't see it any other way, okay. You actually think he'd come? Yeah. He'll come. Hey, Jesse. Yeah? Can you give Harris a call for me? Okay. Stay safe, brother. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Okay, not bad. Yeah. How'd you move all this in here so fast? Oh, I hired an interior designer. Can you tell? Come on, have a seat. No, but actually the guy who owned this house had a heart attack or something and left all his shit here. The place was full of mold, and asbestos, all kinds of stuff. So, I got a good deal on it. Asbestos, huh? Okay, yeah. Might as well make ourselves at home. I don't plan on staying here too long. This is a last resort type of place. Jane says your here a lot now. So this is all you brought me, huh? Don't be such a needy dick. Okay, more is coming, I just. I need time. I don't know how much I got left. Look. I'm gonna stay here with you for a bit. Whatever you have planned, I'm sure I'll be game for. I just don't want anything else to happen to you. You know I gotta do this myself. And you know if something happened to you, because of me, it would really fuck me up. I appreciate everything you've done so far, Linn. But this is where it stops. It's funny. Even growing up, I remember when we would get in trouble. Like, really bad trouble, where we thought it could be the end. We would tell each other, go Zen. Calm everything down, and just be at peace with it. And it's going to be okay. Remember that? Yeah, I do. Just hope it doesn't come down to that. All right, listen up. Vinnie's not fucking around. We need to take this guy out now. No more fucking games. Here's the plan, so listen good. You two, you're gonna go straight on up. Roger. You two, you're gonna go right and flank him. And I want him dead. I'm gonna take the six. All right, squad up and move the fuck out now. Move out. - Clear. - We're going in. Fuck. They need our help. I'm gonna fucking help them. Do you not hear that? They need our fucking help. Do you want them to die? Hey, fuck. You mother fucker. Fuck! Mother fucker. Fuck you, Ryker. Stop. Put it down. Good. How many more are with you? How many did Vinnie bring with you? Don't worry about Vinie. - You worry about me right now. - Okay. Fine. Go to sleep, mother fucker. Drop it! I dropped it. Okay. Aw fuck. Oh shit. No, no. No, no. Yeah, I talked to him like an hour ago. He's losing his fucking shit. Yeah, he basically just kicked me out. He's way in over his head. I have no idea what he's doing. Yeah, you getting followed too? Yeah. Yeah, they're coming to me too. What a fucking mess. What a fucking mess. Yeah, he's not listening to me, man. He's not listening to anyone. I think that's the point where you need to draw the line somewhere. You're getting your friends involved that have nothing to fucking do with it. You know me. I'm out of the fucking game. I want nothing to do with this shit. Yeah. Yeah. You pay him a visit since? No, I have not, but. I guess I have to, right? Look, man. I'm telling you. He's not gonna stop until he's dead, or he tries to wipe out everybody. That includes Vinnie. Yeah, that's. I can't see that going well. Stay safe. Yeah. I'll stay safe. All right, brother. I'll talk to you soon, man. Yeah. See ya. Vinnie's getting pretty desperate now, huh? I'm gonna chop your fucking balls off. Okay. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Die, bitch. Fuck. Look, I know I. I don't usually stick my neck in your business. I know you gotta get yours, but. I got a bad feeling about this. I feel like you're way in over your head. It's not Hanoi anymore. You can't just grab your fucking M16, and fire all your problems away. Those days are gone. And I really think you need to listen to Jane, and get the fuck outta here. If it's money that you need, I could get you five hundred dollars. I'll see what I have left, but you can have it. But you have to run. And... I wouldn't worry about me. But I feel like, at a certain point, you're gonna have no one left to turn to. And then you'll be fucked. So take it from a friend, while you still have a chance. I love you to death, but you're fucking stupid. Here. Take this. I know you wanted me to have it, but. I think you need to remember where you came from. Fucking dumb ass, but I love you. - Man to man. - Man to man, huh? - As always. - Yep. How do you say it? - Lion's fight. - Lion's fight. All right, Lukas. Let's go. So this guy, your friend. What's his name, Vinnie? My employer. He's not a friend. Remember that. He must pay you a lot, huh? This house. Yeah. I do it mostly for Jane. How much? Why? Are you interested? Well, maybe. I need a job. So I would like you to introduce me to him, if you want. I don't know, man. He's a snake. Why? He makes you do shit you don't want to do. This is nightmare shit. I wake up at night thinking about the shit he makes me do. How about for a while, not kind of always. See, that's not how it works. Come on. That's not how it works. Okay? Once you're in with Vinnie, you don't get out. It's not like a part time job. See, he doesn't let you out once you're in. Okay? That's what I'm saying. Well, maybe I would enjoy it. No? Just like this. Yeah, I guess you would. Well, who needs to get out, if you can afford a house like this? It's not about just the money, man. See? Always about the money with you, huh? You know what's gonna happen? Nice. Nice. And I thought we were friends. That was good, man. Yeah, thanks for whooping my ass. You getting better, though. You gave me two good shots. I'm impressed. So this house. It is yours now, huh? Thank you. But it's not my house. I'm just staying here. For how long? Just a few months. That's it? It is beautiful. I love it. So, yeah. Did you think about what I asked? I did. And I'll introduce you to Vinnie. And whatever happens after that, it's up to you. I'll take it. I need money. And I need a house like this. Vinnie didn't pay for this house, man. Well, someone did. And I'm sure it's not IRS. Ryker! Get your hands up! I ain't got time for this shit today! Don't you fucking eyeball me, boy! Now I know you killed all them people! What's your problem, huh? Momma didn't give you enough attention? I can't fucking believe it. You sitting up there eating a fucking can of soup out of all them people you done killed. Yeah, I know what you're thinking! I know what you're thinking! You thinking you quicker than this bullet, huh? You think you quicker than this bullet? Give me a reason to put a bullet through your pee brain. Go for it. Go for it. I double dare you. I double- Ryker! Ryker! Welcome home, Ryker. Surprise. Want to fight just man to man? Like we used to. Okay. Figured Vinnie would send your ass. Lets go, friend. Okay. So you would do anything for money. Get up, Lukas! Get up! What? Are you getting comfortable? Okay. You feel better? Ow! Doesn't seem like a day in the park, huh? It's all right now. You know what, Ryker? I don't want the bag anymore. I like it this way. I thought you had some guts. I have never been so wrong in my life, yeah? We're gonna play a game now. When I say now, you're gonna hold your breath. Now. Not bad, not bad. Now, soldier! Now! Good bye, my friend. We having fucking fun yet, huh? What? What the fuck did you do to this guy? He fucking moved. He fucking moved? Certain things we gotta do to make moves, you hear me? You know who the fuck I am, don't you? Look at me when I'm fucking talking to you. Look at me when I'm fucking talking to you. I said, do you know who the fuck I am? He asked you a fucking question. I know who the fuck you are. Fucking let go of me. Now we're getting somewhere. Good. Good fucking thing. This is good. So tell me, you fucking wanker. What the fuck am I doing here, huh? This fucking place? What the fuck am I doing here? How am I supposed to know what the fuck you're doing here? You could be a, maybe you're trying to- - Tick tock, tick fucking tock. Time is money. Let me fill in the fucking blanks for you. I know you know Ryker. And I know you know what he's doing to my fucking men. And between me and you, I don't fucking like it. Matter of fact, it's getting a little fucking irritating. Don't you think so? Good. Good? Good? This kids got some fucking balls. I like it. Let me ask you a fucking question. You know what I did to his wife and kid, don't you? Mother fucker. Sit the fuck down. Mother fucker. Fuck you. You fucking scumbag, fuck you. I like it. He's got fucking fire. Look at him. Look at him. He's a fucking bombshell. Now let me tell you something. I would have used them if I could, but the problem is they're not fucking here. Look around you. Nobody's fucking here. 'Cause I want that piece of shit, fucking Ryker to come out of his fucking bunker. But here's the good fucking news. You're gonna help me talk him the fuck down. You're here. You're the fucking guy. You're his guy, his confinery, his best friend, his fucking butt buddy, wherever the fuck you are. But I need you to talk him down. 'Cause if you don't fucking talk him down, I'm gonna make it rain napalm all over that fucking place. You fucking here me? He's not gonna tell you anything. He's not gonna tell me anything either. He better fucking does. You better make sure he fucking talks. Calm him the fuck down. Because if you don't, I'm gonna make your life a living fucking hell. Fuck yourself! He's not gonna say anything! Do whatever the fuck you gotta do. I'm tired of losing all these fucking men. I got nobody left, except for this fucking guy. And if he fucking talks? Calm him the fuck down. Where are you gonna go from there? Don't worry about what I'm gonna fucking do. Fuck you. Don't fucking worry about it. You should show some respect. Fuck you. Hey, hey hey. Talk him down. Fuck yourself. Stop fucking moving. You're like a dead fucking fish. Calm the fuck down, and ask me the fucking question. Fuck you. Talk him down. That's all you got to fucking worry about. Don't be a fucking wiseguy, here me? Talk him down! Fucking cock sucker. Let him go. Fuck you. Fuck! What's going on? Oh, so he calls you here. What, for some drinks? You know he doesn't do that anymore. I just came to see him. I think it's gonna have to be a boy's night in for the two of you. I'm out of here. Don't don't do this. What the hell is going on? Ryker is never gonna listen to me. He spends more time here than he does anywhere else. It's like he's waiting for something to go nuclear. And all I want to do is leave. You don't get it. Ryker is always gonna fight any battle that comes to him. He doesn't want to be running his whole life. And you know he's never been good at hiding. Okay. I want you to be honest with me, Jesse. Yeah. What is he doing this time, really? What has he gotten himself into? I really don't know this time. No, no no. Don't bull shit me. I know that he tells you things that he would never tell me, and definitely not his kid. Why is he doing this? I'm gonna go up there and talk to them. But just know that even over me, he's never gonna let anything bad happen to you, or your kid. Even when we were babies, he was always looking out what's best for you, always. You're really all he's got. I remember that time in Junior High when I said I might've had a crush on you. He said. He said, your my best friend, but she's the girl I'm gonna marry. I think everything's gonna be okay, but just let me go up there and talk to him. Okay. Just call me. Yeah. Sure. It's gonna be fine. Bravo, Mr. Fucking Ryker. You really did a fucking number. You fucked things up. What are you gonna do, shoot me? Yeah, that's right. You don't have any more fucking bullets, 'cause you used it on my fucking men. Now tell me this. Where the fuck are the bodies, huh? They're in the back. But I left a space for you. For me? You fucking wise guy. I brought somebody for you. You're gonna fucking love this. Come here. No. Don't you touch him. Would you fucking look at this? A fucking reunion! Don't tell him anything. Shut the fuck up! What do you want? What do I want? What do I fucking want? I was waiting for you to fucking ask me that fucking question. I'll tell you what I want. How about you hand over that fucking bag? Why? It doesn't mean anything to you. It doesn't mean anything to me. But it means something to you. Now I got your fucking boy. You're acting like a little bitch. To prove to you that I can take fucking take anything from you in a fucking second. Hand over the fucking bag. I'm sorry, Jesse. I can't. You really are a stupid fuck, aren't you? What the fuck you got in there, huh? Your hopes and fucking dreams? Huh? Is that what you're doing? You holding onto some fucking shit in there. Give me the fucking bag. I'm not gonna fucking ask you again. I can't. You can't? I understand. No. Vinnie, don't. We've had fucking dinners together. You fucking moron. You're forcing my fucking hand. I don't want to fucking do this. But I gotta fucking do this. This isn't on me. This is on you! No! Fuck you, mother fucker. You just shot my fucking man! You want to fucking play? I'll fucking play, Ryker! Fucking piece of shit. Goombah! All right, fucking say something. Fuck. All right, mother fucker. You want to play? I'm gonna fucking play with you. Hey. Where the fuck are you guys? Yeah, who the fuck we got left? Bring them up, everybody. Yeah fucking now. Bring everybody up. In about ten fucking seconds, I'm gonna have all my fucking men in here. And they're gonna fucking rain on your fucking parade, fucking Ryker. And until then, I'm gonna fucking enjoy me a fucking cigar. Because you have caused me a fucking headache today. This is fucking good, yeah. You get down there. You ready to fucking play? I'm gonna fucking enjoy this. Make it rain, boys. Fucking loud. Don't you hit that chair. That's my favorite fucking chair. Yeah, that's fucking right. Do your job, all on this mother fucker. Yeah, take that fucking Ryker. Take it, fuck you. You're not Lord of this fucking game. Hey, man. What's up, bro? Ryker. Looks like you're letting yourself slide a little bit. Still chasing that modeling career? No. I am the new model. Then why are you here? Because I want you to come back home now. It's time.
