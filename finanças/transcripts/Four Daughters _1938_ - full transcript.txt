I forgot the soup bone for dinner. Soup bone? Bum. I hope your soup is better than your music. That's enough. Darling, you can't be mad just because we didn't turn out to be four little genii. Anyway, you seem to forget there is a genius in the family. If you're referring to Kay, it's just an ordinary voice that needs years of hard work and training. Father, when you applied at the foundation for the scholarship, you wrote: "A thrilling voice, the greatest this side of Tetrazzini." Well, I couldn't spell mediocre. Anyway, they expect a father to exaggerate. Spell exaggerate. E-X-- What's the use of having a voice like Tetrazzini if you are too lazy to study and stuffing yourself with chocolates and reading trash. Look at it, true love stories. Bum. You ought to be glad with the way we are instead of old frumps with long noses and eyeglasses. That's what you really deserve, Mr. Lemp. The trouble with you, Dad, is that you're old-fashioned. Old-fashioned? I suppose you'd like this house full of jazz, swing and crooners and hotshots. ♪ Da da da ♪ Will you be quiet? Will you stop it? Adam, Adam, Adam. I could hear you at the back of the house. So could all the neighbors. Well, let the whole world hear. I've been a good person. What have I done to deserve such daughters? How many more times must I remind you about your blood pressure? Listen, you're my sister, not my doctor. It's my blood pressure. Yes. If I want it to go up, it will go up. I want it to go up. Well, let it, let it. This modern trash isn't and never will be music. I won't insult my ears with it! I-I'd rather hear Brahms played with discords. ♪ Ta ta da ta ta ♪ I'm going down to the hall of records to strike my name off your birth certificates. Keep calm, Dad. Let me kiss you, Dad. I don't wanna. Now, don't take them seriously. Keep smiling, Dad. Would you like an umbrella? Isn't gonna rain. Let me fix your tie. Let it hang. I never knew a man who got so much enjoyment out of being angry. Girls, you shouldn't tease him like that. Hello, Mr. Lemp! Hello, young man. Emma. Here comes your heartbeat. Oh, stop kidding. Hello. Oh, more flowers. You know what I need. You shouldn't Well, this-this time, Aunt Etta-- You see, what I'm trying to say-- Never mind, never mind. Take it easy, take it easy. Hello, everybody. Hello, Ernest. Hello, Ernest. Hello, Emma. Hello. What is it today, Ernest? Orchids. Orchids? Oh, you shouldn't. The flowers you brought yesterday are still as fresh as can be. Well, uh, it's-it's for you. Why, Ernest, I didn't know you needed glasses. I'm Thea, the clever sister. There's Emma. Run along to her with the orchids, and bless you, my children. But th-this time it's-it's really for you. For me? What? Just a small town lothario. Shame on you. Yes. Thanks. There's a card inside, the fellow came into the shop and he suggested that I come up-- From Mr. Benjamin Crowley. Something on the back. "I hope you'll wear these tonight." Why, Thea, who is he? Where do you meet him? You've been holding out on us. Look, girls, I just met him this morning. The handsomest-- Where did you meet him? With Amanda Rawlings at tennis. He drove up in a great, big, gray car. Did you say the handsomest? He's the-- Well, uh, make it the most distinguished. Is he tall? He's got-- Yes and no. He's-- Is he young? He's young enough. And he's-- Is he rich? He's strictly surtax. President of the Boosters' Society, he's recording secretary of the Salt Marsh Gun Club, loves duck dinners-- And he probably has indigestion every Tuesday and Friday. Oh. What did you say his name was again? Mr. Benjamin Crowley. I'd better-- No middle name? Then he can't be so very rich. No. He asked me to the country club dance tonight and I accepted. You didn't. Yes, I did. I guess I better get going. I beg your pardon? I said, I guess I'd better go. Oh, yes. Well, goodbye. Goodbye. Oh, Ernest, what did you have to them bring for? You see, you spoiled everything. Why couldn't I have had the thrill of the delivery boy rushing up the door? Flowers for Miss Thea Lemp. Don't be silly. Well, it seems sort of foolish me living next door. It saved the boy a trip and-- Of course, Ernest. It was the sensible thing to do. And you're just in time to get your socks. Oh, I forgot. Oh, here they are, Emma. Aunt Etta, don't you think orchids are just my type? Oh, they're beautiful, dear. That's romance for you, Orchids in one hand, socks in another. Shh. Here they are. They're all mended. Gee, Emma, I don't know how to thank you. Don't thank me. Aunt Etta darned them. Oh, well, thank you for handing them to me. Oh, aren't they marvelous? If there's anything I can do-- They're dry. You don't have to wring them. Oh, excuse me. Look out! Goodbye. If ever some day he finishes a sentence, I'll marry him. I hope he does. Hey, Emma. What, Ernest? You just wait here a minute. I forg-- It's for you. Ernest, you can't afford this. Well, as long as Mr. Crowley can send orchids to Thea, I guess, uh-- Well, I-- Goodbye. Goodbye. I guess I'd better run along. Bye. - Hey, Emma. Emma. - Where's your slip? I can't find it. I've been looking all over for it. Thea Lemp, you're not gonna wear another slip of mine. I have one good stocking, Thea. That will make a pair. I'll be glad to do your hair for you. For heaven's sake, let's get going. He'll be here any moment, million dollars and all. Hey, what's going on in here. Let me have your slip. Maybe someday you'll want mine. Hey, Emma. You'll find it in my drawer over by the window. Fine state of affairs when I have to look in Kay's drawer for my slip, so that Thea can wear it. Here we are, working ourselves into a lather-- Kay, why don't you do something? I'm doing very important work. I'm relaxing for you. Every time a Lemp beauty goes out, the rest of the family becomes a nudist colony. You all think Master Ben Crowley's worthy of all this year fuss? Well, sure he is, honey child. Ben Crowley's got money and lots of it. What Thea wants is butlers like the Rawlings and lots of servants to order around. We get along. Yes, making over old dresses. I want people to point me out in a crowd and say: "There goes the smart Mrs. Crowley." But suppose you don't love him? Love's overrated, old-fashioned, last generation. Last generation or not, I still want love. Storybook style with all the trimmings. A knight in shining armor on a white horse. Um, don't be silly. Where can you find a white horse? Why worry about the future? If you've got anything coming to you, it will come. Ann, tell them I'm right. About love, I mean. I don't think you are. I wouldn't mind mothering someone, like a kitten or a puppy or a baby. But I want fun, lots of laughs. And all the married people I've seen, well, they're a little short on laughter. Maybe if I had a baby without any husband-- Now you are talking nonsense. Oh, I don't mean having a baby, just mothering someone. Oh, you get the idea. I hope not. Ben's being announced. He would be punctual. - That's his car. - Isn't it a beauty? Looks paid for. I still like a white horse. Gee, Thea, an open car. It'll mush your hair up every which way. No, it won't. I'll wear your scarf. Oh, I was afraid of that. The orchids. The orchids. Let me fix your-- Oh, you forgot the family cape. Hurry up, Ann. Where's the cape? Where's the cape? Oh, it's on the couch! I wish it were gold dust. Here's the cape. You're a darling. Wish me luck. Aren't we going to meet him? What? And have him wonder why he picked me? You're all better-looking than I am, but I'm the smart one. Goodbye. Come on. Come on, Kay. Here's your chance to see Master Crowley. Must I? Good evening, Thea. Good evening, Ben.

It's going to be a wonderful dinner. Oh, I hope so. Just leave it to us. We'll take care of Mr. Crowley's vitamins. Calm down. You'll look as if you really did cook this. That reminds me. Ann, have you got your line straight? Mm-hm. Let me hear it. "Oh, Mr. Crowley, I just can't get over it. Thea cooked the whole dinner, every inch of it. Just look at her. She's as fresh and beautiful as if she'd just stepped out of a bandbox." I'm hungry. That's wonderful. I think I've finished setting the table. Thanks, Dad. Now, the next thing to fix-- Dad, you're tie. What's the matter with my tie? Be a dear and let me fix you? Oh, go on then. Ow. To think that I have to go through all this three more times. And that is Mr. Benjamin Crowley. Now, wait a minute. I'm starving. Now, you-- Now, you girls do a little last minute primping. I'll answer the door. No. Not with that apron on. It might be a good idea. Let Mr. Crowley see how bullied I am. No. You put your coat on, Dad. I'll see to the door. Girls, you tidy up a bit and don't forget the flowers. Oh, Kay. Slip this sweater on. I wore that dress last night. Oh, alright. Good evening, Ben. Good evening, Thea. May I have your hat? Oh, yes. Thank you. You have a very lovely home here. Thanks. Your coat? Oh, yes, my coat. Gee, you're looking beautiful tonight. Thank you, Ben. I hope my watch is right. I've been driving around the block. Afraid I'd be here too early. You're right on time, just as usual. Well, that's my long suit, punctuality. I believe in hitting appointments right on the nose. Yes. Uh, I've been taught better than to point, but, uh, do you know the finest father in the world? I added that for a little sentimental touch. How do you do? Very glad to meet you, sir. The pleasure is mine, Mr. Crowley. Thank you. Would you like a little wine? Well, I don't care if I do. We have some very nice homemade blackberry. Thank you. Oh, and this is Aunt Etta. Well, well, Aunt Etta. I've heard a great deal about you. Have you? What have you heard? Well, uh, only the best. Thank you. And this is my sister, Emma. Oh, how do you do, Emma. How do you do? And this is Kay. How are you, Kay? This is Ann, the baby. Hello. I was the baby in our family too. Would you like to sit down? Yes, I would. Your very good health, Mr. Crowley. Drink hearty. Nothing like a little homemade blackberry to warm you up a bit. That's what I always say. I made it myself. Would you like to sit down? Thank you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll have to go in and attend to the dinner. A rosebud garden of girls. Quite a poetry. Oh, that's, uh-- That isn't original with me. I-I must have read that somewhere. But the fella who wrote it must have certainly seen this family. Come along, come along. Dinner's all ready. May I? Yes. We've got duck. There's nothing like a good home-cooked dinner. Your home is charming. Thanks. You sit here. You get a nice view of the kitchen. Thank you. Oh, Mr. Crowley, I just can't get over it. Thea cooked the whole dinner, every inch of it. Just look at her. She's as fresh and beautiful as if she'd just stepped out of a bandbox. Yes, she is. Beautiful. Uh, may I have your gloves? Yes. Oh, my gloves. The duck smells delicious. We thank thee, oh, Lord, for the bounty we are about to receive and ask thy blessing Oh! Oh! Oh! What is it, Aunt Etta? You might as well face the situation. Ann forgot to light the oven under the duck! Oh! For the sandwiches we are about to receive, we thank thee, oh, Lord, and ask thy blessing. I wish I could stop lying to my diary. You saved a little boy from being run over today? No. But makes good reading. That sounds like Thea. It is. I'm dying to know what's happened. So am I. Thea came home-- Kay, wake up! Emma, how do you spell intoxicated? I-N-T-O-X-I-C-A-T-E-D. - This is more important. - Got something to tell you. It can't be that important. Emma! For heaven's sakes, you'll wake up the whole family. I've got something to tell you! I've got something to tell you! What? What happened? It's happened. What? Tomorrow at Tiffany's. The ring. It must be a hundred karats. For Pete's sake, Thea, what happened? What did he say? Well, I was looking so beautiful in Emma's dress, Yes? And your hat and your coat. But what did he say? "Thea," he said-- Oh, I gotta go tell-- Oh, what did Ben say? He said, "All I am, all I ever hope to be..." Oh, I'll tell you later. Ask Ben if he minds being a bigamist, I want a ring too. Aunt Etta! Dad! Aunt Etta! Emma. Yes? Do you think she really loves him? She's gonna marry him. I mean, do you think she loves him as much as she loves us? Well, it's a different kind of love, Ann. You mean a stranger could come in here and mean more to me than Father or Aunt Etta? More than my own sisters? More than you? Oh, you're certainly not very worldly wise. Oh, Ann. Emma. Don't let's get married, ever. Let Thea and Kay if they want to, but not us. We'll grow old together, beautifully and gracefully. Wait and see. We'll both look just like Whistler's mother. Yes, but if we don't get married, how can we look like anybody's mother? You'll feel a lot differently one day. You're a lot younger than I am. Five years. What's that? And I practically brought you up. Didn't I have mumps, chicken pox and measles when you did? Out of sheer companionship. You little wretch, you gave them to me. No. I shared them with you. Oh. Emma. Look at me. What? You haven't met anyone? I mean, you're not holding out on me, are you? No. Apparently, I'm headed for the shelf. The Lemp family is gonna have one old maid. Two. And we'll have a cat, a tortoise shelled one. We'll call it Bathsheba. Mm-mm. Mehetabel? Mm-mm. Topaz. Because it'll have yellow eyes and the longest and most gorgeous tail. Wait a minute. Don't make it too beautiful. We want her to be an old maid too. Hey! Hello. Hey, what's the big idea? This your gate? I've an interest in it, yes. It isn't much good for swinging. You know that, don't you? Well, you have a nerve. I've swung on it for 18 years. It's done alright by me. Evidently my standards are much higher. The fault lies with you, not with the gate. You don't know how to swing on gates. I don't? No. Ridiculous. No leverage, that's your trouble. Mind if I show you? Not at all. After all, it's your gate. Alright. Now, watch this. This is the way you do it. Hmm. See? Say, that is good. This how you do it? Almost. Almost, huh? A little more pressure on the ball of your foot, and you've got it. There, that's it. That it? Now you've got it. This is the third or fourth or maybe fifth happiest day of my life. Oh, excuse me. Well, of all things. Oh, hello, Mrs. Ridgefield. How do you do? Oh, this is Mr.-- Deitz. Felix Deitz. Old friend of the Lemps. Oh, this is Mrs. Ridgefield. How are you, Mrs. Ridgefield? Why, I'm fine, thank you. And Mr. Ridgefield? Why, he's fine too. How's his back? Better? Much better. I'm so glad to hear it. Goodbye, Mrs. Ridgefield. Well, of all things! How do you know Mr. Ridgefield? First time I ever heard of him. I don't understand. How'd you know his back was bothering him? Oh. Well, Mrs. Ridgefield looks like the sort of woman whose husband would have trouble with his back. Mrs. Gabby. See that man at the Lemp's house? What's this "old friend of the family" business? Oh, a slight exaggeration. See, my father was a very good friend of old Mr. Lemp. I'm his daughter. He's not so very old. Oh, so you're Miss-- Ann. Ann, the gate swinger. Well, Ann, in this pocket, I've a letter to father and in this-- In fact, he's quite young looking. Well granted. But what-- He's down at the foundation. He works there. Dean of the faculty. He's one of the youngest looking deans they've ever had. I'm sure he must be. Well, this, a letter to the president of the foundation. Could you possibly direct me? Why, yes. It's down one block, and on the corner of Lamont, you'll find it. The foundation? Thank you. No. The traffic officer's booth. Ask the policeman where the foundation is. He'll tell you. Thank you again. You're welcome. I must be stuck. Bye. Goodbye. Oh, by the way, what have you for dinner tonight? Lamb chops. Why? That'll do very nicely. Nobody invited you for dinner. Your father will. I'll see to that. Au revoir. Oh. See you for dinner then. Goodbye, Mrs. Ridgefield. Why... There's no reason to set the extra place, Ann. He won't be here. I've seen him. He'll be here. He'll not only be here, but he'll tell us where to sit, monopolize the conversation, do the carving, say grace, and help himself to a second portion of dessert. That's my impression of Mr. Deitz. And my impression of your impression is Mr. Deitz sells vacuum cleaners or something. Well, whatever he sells, you'll buy it. Oh, no. I'm completely won over. Kay, may I use your face powder? You may not. I'm won over too. I'm going to be that beauty tonight. I refuse to be disturbed out of my usual calm. I shall devote myself to my lamp chops. Well, you'd better. Don't forget you're engaged. Say, what does he look like? He's about-- What's that? You-- That's Mr. Deitz. Would you like a try? Your father was a great musician and a great man. What would he have said to these antics? It was my father who taught me this art. Your daughter improved it. Bah! This modern music won't live. Beethoven has lived and will live on every opera stage, in every concert halls. Opera stages, concert halls. Do you call that living? Bah. You and your jazz and your swing. Bah! Now promise me you won't say bah again. Alright, I promise you. Well, uh, gir-- Something is wrong here. Father! Why, hello, Dad! Darling! We thought you'd never get back. How's my handsome dad? Did you have a hard day, dear? Something is still wrong. Hello, Deitz. Hello, Lemp. Father, dear, won't you, uh--? Girls, this in Felix Deitz. He's a blasted young topper who prefers jazz to classics. He's arrogant, disrespectful, argumentative, conceited, uh-- And I like him. You forgot to mention that I have no talent whatsoever. You've been telling me all way home. They can see that just by looking at you. I'm Thea. You look talented to me. What do you do? I compose. Oh. I'm Kay. How do you do? How do you do? What do you compose? Trash. If he'd only listen to Beethoven-- Modern tone poems, I call them. And I think so little of Beethoven, I wouldn't bother to steal from him. You promised me faithfully you wouldn't say bah again. Bah. I'm Emma. Positively the last sister. Very glad to know you, Emma. I'm very glad to know you. Well, go ahead, produce more. I'm not the least bit tired. Excuse me. You said there were no more sisters. Meet the youngest. Delighted. Etta, this is Felix Deitz, son of my old friend. This is Aunt Etta. How do you do? I'm pleased to meet you. You're not only the youngest, but the most charming. Oh, you embarrass me. You know, Aunt Etta, I'm going to sit next you at dinner and we'll hold hands under the table. In other words, I'm just your type. Exactly. Flatterer! I'm flattered to be with such a lovely family. Mm. Huh! Adam. He's the brightest thing that's come into this house since the electric percolator. There's no help for it. You're gonna have to see quite a lot of him. The president of the foundation? Yes. Hardboiled, isn't he? Pure granite. It took this young man here just seven minutes to talk him into giving him a job at the foundation. Ten minutes, I timed it. That includes the introductions and the goodbyes. That means you're going to live in Briarwood. It does. Oh, we all want you to feel free to come and swing on our gate any time you like. Emotion chokes me. Well, this calls for a special celebration. Emma, put the best silver on the table. We did, Aunt Etta. Dinner napkins with the monograms. They're on the table. I put them there just on Ann's description. Oh. Well, do you realize, Mr. Deitz, those dinner napkins and that silver had not been used, not once? Not even when the mayor was here for dinner? Oh, I'm honored. Oh. Thanks, Lemp. That's alright, Deitz. Home made blackberry. Oh. I made it. Well, where you gonna live? Oh, I hadn't thought about that yet. There's a hotel in town. Sort of small but-- And mangy. Don't think you'd like it. Well, there are a couple of nice rooming houses. Now, now, now, now. Suppose we discuss this after dinner. In the meantime, my lamb chops are getting cold. That 's a very good idea. Here's what we'll do. Suppose you sit over there by me. Right over there. Miss Kay, we'll put you right in this chair. Oh. That's especially reserved for gate swingers. Thank you. Miss Emma, I think you'll be comfortable right over here. Miss Thea, I have a very special seat for you. There isn't that better? I suppose you have no objection to my sitting in my customary chair, have you? Not at all, sir. Make yourself at home. Well, thank you, sir. Well, what did I tell you, girls? I'll tell you a secret, diary. I like him. ♪ Lullaby and good night ♪ ♪ With roses bedight ♪ ♪ Creep into thy bed ♪ ♪ There pillow thy head ♪ ♪ If God will ♪ ♪ Thou shalt wake ♪ ♪ When the morning Doth break ♪ ♪ If God will ♪ ♪ Thou shalt wake ♪ ♪ When the... ♪ Look. Over the hill, that is I mean to say there are some beautiful rhododendrons. I thought maybe we could walk over-- I can't right now, Ernest. I've gotta finish mending Felix's sweater. The malls have declared a vendetta against it. Oh, look, my button. I saw that, Ernest, and it won't do you a bit of good. Oh, this is gorgeous. It's beautiful! Simply beautiful. I wouldn't mind building right on this spot. Oh, we could buy it for a song. Put the house right over there facing the creek. In your name, of course. Subdivide it, give it a fancy name. I'll bet I could make a pretty penny. Not if I wouldn't consider it too. If you'd only name the day for the wedding. Hey, it's almost June. Does the idea of being a June bride intrigue you? Let's talk about it before. I promise I'll be much more definite then. What's the verdict? Does he love you? Love you not? That's what I'm trying to find out. Well, haven't I told you that? Yes. What are you cooking? Barley soup. I don't like barley soup. Felix likes it. Hey, Felix. What? Come here. What is it? Do something about the sun, won't you? It's in my eyes. Well, put your hand over your eyes. You do it. I don't wanna pamper myself. Alright. See, that's all there is to it. Is that better? Mm-hm. That's good. Hey, Emma. Excuse me a minute. You do it a while. I'll take that bucket. I can manage. Oh, you can carry it back when it's full. That's the idea. Here we are. Here, give it to me. Why is it no musician can ever make a decent knot at his tie? Because the musicians-- Let me fix it. Alright. There. Say, you've got a steady job fixing my ties. That is if you can take time off from your cooking and sewing and cleaning. Sounds like interesting work. I'll find the time. Thanks. Well, I suppose we're holding up Aunt Etta. She must be waiting for the water. Yes. We better get back. I'll take it. You look positively radiant, Emma. That's because the sun's shining and the flowers are in blossom, and Kay loaned me her face powder. Hey. All this bunk you read about druids living in trees and loving it. I'll take the Lemp home many all time. That's not drinking water. Who's afraid of little typhoid? Oh, no, you don't. I don't like you with your tie straight. Emma just fixed it. There, that's a lot better. Better with your hair mushed. Oh, you wanna fight, do you? I'll take you on. Hanging tough, huh? Here. Step over that line. Sure. Oh, you. Hey. Stand up and fight like a man. Hey. Somebody better go to the stand and get more hot dogs. You're father's made away with a dozen. I'll go in my bike. I'll race you there. Oh, stick to your piano. Give you a minute's handicap instead of only one foot. That won't help. Bring me a case of beer! Fe-- - Hey, what's holding you back? - Got an anchor on your wheel? - I'm a slow starter. - Watch me in the stretch. Oh, look out. Look out! Oh! Oh, oh! Oh! Oh! Gee, things were quiet till you came to live with us. Something about you that always sets people to laughing. There's an effect you have too. Yeah, what? You do something to a room. The minute you enter it, it lights up. Who me? Yeah. Maybe an Edison has an explanation for it, but I can't understand it at all. Somehow, what happens to that room is transferred to me. I glow too. Oh, I haven't noticed it. Oh, it's an inner glow, the expensive kind. We're a great combination, aren't we? Light and laughter. Yes, but we can't have one without the other. If you don't light up, I can't laugh. And vice versa. So we two, we should never be further apart than a stone's throw, should we? I'll vote for that. Ann, I don't know whether this fits into the conversation or not, but your eyes are very beautiful. It fits. Ann. Holy smoke, the hotdogs. We left the family starving back there and there are members of that family I'm fond of. Wait a minute. Here's a little memento I picked up for you. Oh, Felix, that's darling. Oh, it's nothing. Just a little trinket. Isn't worth very much. One of the charms says, "I love you if you like it." Thanks. Oh, don't thank me. Just promise me we'll go back slowly. I promise. Yeah. Gee, I bet they'll be starved. I bet they will too. - Felix. - Felix, you must stop it. Stop it. Do you hear me? Felix, you listen to me. Listen to me. I don't mind you're wasting your time, but don't waste it on my piano. First prize is a thousand dollars. We'll use it to buy you a new piano. You're gonna win first prize, are you? With this collection of catcalls? Come on, you've got a class to teach at 3:00. There's still half an hour. I'm waiting for Mickey Borden. Who's he? Piano player I picked up. Help me orchestrate my composition. It's criminal wasting another person's time on this abomina-- Not exactly a waste of time. You see, Mickey's out of a job right now and I can use him. Tell him that orchestrating this stuff is one step lower than being out of work. Will he be here soon? He's an hour late now, but he may not be here for a week. In fact, he may not get here at all. I was un-- I was under the impression that only trombone players drink. Oh, Mickey doesn't drink. He's just a little, well, unpredictable. Well, I'm very glad to hear it. No complete insane person could do a good job on that. Furthermore-- I'll see you at the foundation. Appreciate Brahms... I'll get it. Is this...? It is. Come in, Mickey. I've been waiting for you. I've been struggling with this opus for days. You're gonna find this arrangement right up your alley. Hmm, rug on the floor, smell of cooking in the kitchen, piano and flowers. It's homes like these that are the backbone of a nation. Where's the spinning wheel? Shut up. Did you miss the train? I ignored the train. Thumbed my way up. I gave you more than enough for the fare. Well, I bet the $5 on a horse, I could have bought for 7. He had a lovely, Felix, that I can't for the life of me remember. This time of day, plenty of traffic from town. You shouldn't have been this late. Oh, I had lots of offers from small fry, Ford, Chevys. But I held out for a town car. It's a poor man's privilege. Well, I have to get over to the foundation, class from 3 to 4. You get a room in this town for a few weeks till we're through, save you a lot of traveling. Alright with me. I was evicted this morning. I'm gonna miss those cobwebs. You look over this first movement I'll be back after 4 then we'll get you a room. Just so it's on the other side of the tracks. I can't breathe. There's clean air. There's a lady in the kitchen. Introduce yourself to her. Aunt Etta. I know the type. See you later. I thought it didn't sound like Felix playing. As far as I know, you may be a burglar and have designs on the piano. According to Felix, I'm supposed to introduce myself. Mickey Borden. I guess you're Aunt-- Uh, Aunt something or other. Etta. Etta. Yup. Name fits right in with those curtains and that harp. Domestic. My name came first, then the curtains. And what type aunt are you? The gruff voice, hiding your soft heart? Or are you the sweet, simple aunt, "Sakes alive, I smell something burning" aunt? Felix should have prepared me for you. How about a cup of tea? Sure. May I throw in a couple of cakes? Well, how did you know I hadn't eaten since yesterday morning? Oh, I'm the nearsighted, "you can't hide a thing from me" type of aunt. I see. Well, you need not look so noble. Tea is only a little hot water. I'll go and put the kettle on. I'll let you know what I think about you later. Hello, Aunt Etta. - Hello, dear. - You're home early, aren't you? I couldn't go through with my lessons. Steven's brat broke his violin. Oh, isn't that too bad? Did he drop it? That's what I claim, but he says I threw it at him. Oh. This is my niece, Ann. Ann, this is Mickey. Mickey something or other. Borden. Borden? Name just goes with that shirt and tie. He's a friend of Felix, I think. We just know each other. I'm orchestrating his composition. I'm going to make Mr. Borden a cup of tea. Just a little hot water, huh? Get set, you're in for something. Got a cigarette? Oh, yes. Here you are. Cork-tipped, no less. You scared it. It always behaves that way in front of company. Oh, just keep on playing. You know, I read someplace the invention of the cigarette lighter increased the use of matches a thousand percent. I laughed when I read it. You could've at least smiled. Say, is that part of Felix's composition? Something of my own. Oh, it's beautiful. It stinks. You're probably right. I was only making conversation. Still I hope you're not entering it in a competition. You know, around these parts we want Felix to win. I couldn't enter it if I wanted to. It's only got a middle. You only wrote a middle? Just the middle. Oh, no beginning, no end? You think that's right to leave a song dangling in midair with no face, no feet? Why not? Well, for one thing, a full-bodied composition might easily win first prize. I wouldn't win first prize if I were the only entry in the contest. Mathematically speaking, I think you'd stand a fine chance. Do you think they'd let me win? Who? - They. - Well, who? The fates, the destinies, whoever they are that decide what we do or don't get. What do you mean? They've been at me now nearly a quarter of a century. No letup. First, they said, "Let him do without parents. He'll get along." Then they decided, "He doesn't need any education." That's for sissies. Then right at the beginning, they tossed a coin. "Heads he's poor, tails he's rich." So they tossed the coin, with two heads. Then for the finale, they got together on talent. "Sure," they said, "let him have talent. Not enough to let him do anything on his own, anything good or great. Just enough to let him help other people. It's all he deserves." Well, you put all this together and you got Michael Bolgar. Bolgar? That's the name I was born with. I thought If I change it, I'd throw them off the trail. It didn't work. Of course, you know you've been very silly. Who asked for you to listen? I'm sorry. But you're insulting a person who believes that a man decides his own destiny, who believes that if a man has enough courage and enough ambition... I guess I deserved that. But I know enough about music to know if you'd finish your composition-- I tell you they won't stand for my winning. They're up there working overtime against me. What some people will do for time and a half. Well... Here, have another cigarette. We won't talk about it anymore. I can see it's a painful subject. It's my favorite subject. Talking about my tough luck is the only fun I get. But-- Oh, Aunt Etta, help. I can't cope with him. Were you laughing just then? Huh? Were you laughing? Well, yeah, I think so. Why? I wish you'd do me a favor. What? Throw your head back and just laugh. Well, why? No reason. Just laugh. I knew I was right. You don't know the first thing about laughter. I see the sort I'm up against. The gay young thing type. Unimportant species. It isn't the quality of your laughter I'm complaining about, it's your attitude. Attitude? When I wanted you to laugh, you wanted to know why you should as if a person had to have a reason to laugh. And someday I'll give you a little talk on the difference between a laugh and a giggle. Oh, Aunt Etta, you were right. I've had enough. Now, then, cream or lemon? Neither. See here, you're just being purposely contrary-minded. You'll take one or the other. Quick now, which? Now, don't try to be hard-boiled, Etta. It doesn't come off. I'm going to have some tea and figure this man out. Wait till he gets a sandwich. He won't be so vicious. Can you read them? "Thea, Ben, Felix, Ann, Dad, Aunt Etta, Emma, Ernest, Kay and Mickey. No. You deserve better than that. You've improved a lot in a week. Now I'll fix you up. There. How's that? Better? You like yourself? You got me grinning like an idiot. I thought you'd notice the resemblance. Say, were you sneaking around my room yesterday when I was out? How did you guess? I tried not to leave any fingerprints. The minute my back is turned you put curtains up on me. That isn't all. Next time you're out, I'm gonna slip of flower pots on your sill. No. No, no. No flowers. Why not? Well, they use up all the oxygen. Hey, get tough and I'll be up with the lace pillowcase. You just try it. You may object to living like a human being, at least you're going to sleep like one. My landlady's got orders to shoot you on sight. When I'm finished with your room, I'm gonna start in on you. Just look at yourself. Well, what's wrong with me? Your hair's reaching for the ceiling, your tie's at half-mast. And, Mickey, there's something about the state of New York that I want you to know. Huh? What? Well, in the state of New York, it's strictly constitutional to have a crease pants. Tonight's dad's birthday party, and a pair of pressed pants would add just the right touch to the celebration. I'll think about it. I've gotta go in town and buy dad a present. In the meantime, how about doing a little work on your own composition? Ah, shut up. Think what a kick in the pants it would be to those destinies of yours if you'd ran off with first prize. What if I do win? Oh, here it comes again. My picture in life, a new suit, a hullabaloo. Then one morning, I'm walking down the street minding my on business when a bolt of lightning with my number on it follows me around the corner and pfft. Out like a light. Oh, Mickey. That's the way I'm leaving this world. Lightning. I'll give odds. Somewhere, Mickey, there's a straight jacket with your number on it just waiting. Come here I need someone with this one. Why, Mickey. I don't want you to think that this is a spur-of-the-moment kiss. I planned it for a week. It's pretty mild for a week's thought. Just a friendly kiss. Oh. We're going to be great friends, aren't we? Yeah. I'll work at it. In fact, we're gonna be such great friends that we won't have to give each other anything for Christmas. And don't let anyone tell you I haven't done wonders for your smile. Well, I've gotta go now. I'm late. Hello. Hi. Were you on the train? Relieve me of these packages and I'll show you my ticket. Well, then I missed you. I walked all through the train just on the chance that-- I was up with the engineer. We're old friends. I see. And whose hand was on the throttle when we rounded that horseshoe curve? Mine. Congratulations. For one moment, I thought we weren't going to make it. So did the engineer. It seems I picked the wrong time to powder my nose. I'll know better next time. You won't take this personally, I hope, but hereafter I'm taking the bus into town. Oh, I know the bus driver. We're old friends too. Well, there's still the bicycle. Well, we'll walk. I love you, Ann. What did you say? I love you. I can't hear you. I said I love you. I won't say it again. You love me? Yes. Since when? Since the moment I first saw you. You can't be original when you're in love. Well? Well, what? That was in the nature of a proposal. I expect something in the nature of an answer. Of Course, I adore you, Felix. Well, that's a good start. But couldn't we go on just the way we are? You know, lots of laughs? We could be married and still go on laughing. There have been cases. I love you, Ann. I can't swing on a gate, I'm not much good at bundle-carrying, but I'll try to make you happy. You're this crazy world to me, Ann. And the crazy world before this and the crazier world to come. In fact, I love you. I warn you, I'll probably laugh at the ceremony. What do you think I'll be doing? You're sweet, Felix.

Now, I'd appreciate the sentiment a little more if you were all in tune. Well, I never. A radio. A very peculiar radio. It doesn't play jazz. We made the down payment. Well, that's how your mother got the piano. Look, Dad. A velvet smoking jacket. Oh, we just threw a few old curtains together. It will make your old 5-cent cigars look like Coronas. Take a glance at all these, Dad. It looks like a Christmas tree. Why? Hey, look Toscanini. Here's my gift, Adam. Oh. Many happy returns. Ernest. Something to keep you warm next time you listen to Bach. I just happened to be passing Tiffany's the other day. Tiffany's? Ben. Why, Ben, you shouldn't have been so extravagant. Ah. Does it yodel? A watch with a Swiss movement ought to be able to yodel. Oh, don't be silly. Here, Dad. We're just bribing you to stay young. I accept the bribe. That calls for a speech. Speech, speech, speech. Well, uh, this has been the happiest birthday. I shall always remember. I don't suppose I've got many more birthdays. Another crack like that and we'll send you to bed without dinner for a week. Oh, don't mind your father. He's just trying to appear philosophical. But he hasn't got the beard to go with it. Come on, let's cut the cake before I flood the place with tears. I put too many candles on your cake, anyway. Mickey. Huh? You too. Well, that was a kind thought. Uh, I did-- Shh. I got it myself for you. If you don't mind. Well, thanks. That puts me in the class with Ben Crowley. I know he's kind like a book. He's the "I sold papers when I was a kid. And now look at me." type. I've got your type neatly catalogued too. Any bets? At any birthday party, you're the sort that pipes up with: "I never had a birthday party or got a present." Isn't that right? You win. So to prevent you from making that little speech, I got you a present myself. You what? Cuff links with initials. Say. Well, this is no joke. And these are good links. Oh, I always do my shoplifting at the best counters. How-- Oh, be careful. Here's a customer. Mm, wonderful. Did you make this all by yourself? Absolutely. In that case, I can't do without you. We elope tonight at 12. That's a date. Sure? Sure. While you were about it, why didn't you get a new tie? Look at it. Oh, it's alright. Oh, you girls are looking beautiful tonight. You don't look at all like your father. What? Felix, if I were 10 years younger, I-- Oh, bah! Oh, Ann. Party's almost over. How about telling them? You think so? Hold this. You like the cake, Ben? There's something I forgot. Yes. I certainly did. Hear ye, hear ye. Everybody, listen. I have a commercial announcement to make. What is it? Listen! Go ahead, go ahead. Felix and I are engaged to be married. Look. - That's wonderful. - Well, well, Felix. So you're going to be married. She swept me off my feet. Ann, darling. Aunt Etta. Gee, isn't that swell? If we-- Say, don't I got kissed? Why, of course, you do. I think I'm marrying the wrong girl. Oh, you go away. I'm jealous. I've got a good slightly used career I'll exchange for a husband. Let's resemble Felix. I'd like to add my good wishes. - Thanks, Ernest. - I'm glad too. Oh, I'm sure you're both going to be very happy. I feel it in my bones. Thank you, Thea. When do you two children propose to got married? Well, as soon as my laundry gets back. Oh, in August some time. How about some coffee? I'm not too happy to have forgotten about that. I'll start it perking. Oh, Emma. I'll give you a hand. This marriage business isn't contagious, is it? I don't know whether I should give my daughter to a composer of modern music. Oh, you don't? Oh, just this once, Dad. Ann, I think I'll beat you to the altar. What? Do you still want me to be a June bride? I certainly do. Thea. Bring on the orange blossoms. Oh, Thea. Congratulations. I-I don't know what to say. Why should you say anything? June? Then I'll still be here for your wedding, Thea. But, Kay, you'll be here for my wedding too. Nonsense, Kay. Where else would you be? Philadelphia. Studying for that scholarship. And please, I've heard all the jokes about Philadelphia. But you're going so suddenly, Kay. Well, I-- I decided it's about time I got serious about my work. Say, what's got into my family? Well, I think I ought to propose a toast. Let's drink to the happy couples. Fill this cup. This is for you, Ann. Oh, thank you. Happiness, Ann. If you'll bury your head on my left shoulder, there'd be less chance of those people out there hearing you. I can't help it, Aunt Etta. I love Felix and now-- Oh, somebody else will come along. In about six months. That's the usual time. Now don't contradict me, Emma. I know all about these things, being a spinster. Emma? Emma. Emma, you haven't even wi-- Why, Emma, darling, what's the matter? Oh, you mustn't feel like this. I'm not going away. I'm going to stay right here with you. Nothing is going to change for us. Really, it isn't. I know, dear, it-- It's just that I-- That you thought I'd never marry. I didn't think I would either, but we're all going to. We'll have housefuls of children. All violin players. Emma, you like Felix, don't you? - Of course, she does. - We all do. It's just that Emma can't get used to the idea of losing the baby of the family. Any more than I can. Oh, come, girls, pull yourselves together and help me with the coffee. Aunt Etta's right. I'm just being silly, Ann. Come on, let's get busy. Emma, I won't marry him if you don't want me to. We'll still be the old Lemp girls with our tortoise shell cat. No, no. There isn't anything I wouldn't do to make you happy, Emma. Of course, dear, I know that. Ann, they're all gonna begin to wonder what's happened to us. You're sure it isn't because it's Felix. I mean, you've never seemed to like him as well as the rest of us and-- But really, Emma, he's awfully sweet and such fun. After we're married you'll learn to love him. Ann, stop chattering. If we don't get some of this coffee into those people in there, nobody's going to love anybody. Come along now. You, you take the plates and I'll pour the coffee. Thank goodness there's one steady hand in the family. Oh. Well, the coffee wasn't any good, anyway. And just because I'm-- I'm-- That's no reason I've gotta stop trying to make a human being out of you. I'm the girl that brought chintz curtains into your life. I'm not going to stop-- Must you look so beautiful? Who me? You're getting married in an hour. Another dream shot. That isn't tough enough, but you gotta look like a convention of angels. Why must the light hit you just right? If your nose were shiny and your eyes dull, Jehoshaphat, it would make things easier. But look at you, not a hair on your head out of place. A girl can't get married without a permanent. It wouldn't be legal. Nice work. My congratulations. They take a guy in out of the cold, give him a look at a real family, real people. The old man, Aunt Etta. They throw Ann in his path, let her get a half nelson on his heart, then click. Out in the cold again. Here's a new lease on the gutter. Mickey, please, listen to me. Aah. You always said it was my fault. I never put up a battle. Alright, I'm full of fight now. I love you. Nobody else can have you. I love you. Mickey, please, come to your senses. Okay. You see, Ann, your theory's all cockeyed. No use fighting. I accept the verdict. What's more, I'll attend the wedding. My smile will be just as brave as Emma's. Emma? Why should Emma? Why should Emma? You mean to say you don't know Emma is insane about Felix? Emma in love with Felix? Mickey, you must be out of your mind. Heh. I guess when you're used to standing on the outside, looking in, you can see things other people can't. I don't know what you're talking about. Poor Emma, that night when you told everybody, I was watching her. Face went white as a sheet. She ran out of the room. No. When she came back, her eyes were red from crying. That made me feel very close to Emma. But it wasn't that. It couldn't have been. It was because I was getting married. You see, Emma and I have always been so close. Oh, Mickey, I don't believe you. You're only saying it to frighten me. Go ahead. Get married. You better go home. People are waiting. But it isn't true. You were lying, weren't you? Yeah. That's as good a name for it as any. Well, I gotta go. I gotta pack. Goodbye, Ann. Allah be with you. Goodbye, Mickey. You go first. I wanna look after you. Hey, Emma. Yes, Felix? What is this? Is it a tie or a canoe paddle? I can't make it out. Well, in that shape, it's usually called a cravat. It is? Mm. Isn't it awful what getting married will do to you? Any other day I'd have a good answer to that. Well, go to work, Emma. Whatever it is, tie it for me. Gosh, I'm jittery. My fingers have turned to jelly. Feel them. Oh, they're cold. Say, so are yours. Oh. I should've rented this outfit instead of having it made. It would've fit better. How's it coming? Wait a minute. Looks alright. This is the end of my steady job, isn't it? Mm-hm. Isn't that a steal from something? And a good one. Hey! Just leave me enough air to say I do. I'm sorry. Now hold still. There. Thanks. Well, how do I look? Any price tag showing? No. You look very nice. Striped trousers. Isn't that symbolic? ♪ Here comes the groom ♪ The dope. ♪ Here comes the groom ♪ You got 3:12. My watch says 3:08. What time you got, Adam? Oh, oh, uh, 3:15, Ben. 3:15. Excuse me. What do you think happened? Oh, all girls get the fidgets on their wedding day. She probably took a walk to calm herself down. I took a walk on my wedding day. Whatever possessed the child to do such a thing? It'll take her at least 15 minutes to dress. What time did you say you had? I told you, Ben. It's 3:15. Yeah. Wonder what the hall clock says. It says for you to put your wristwatch away, quit acting like a pompous fool! I'm sorry, Thea. My first wedding, I can stand a bracer. That must be Ann now, Aunt Etta. Well, it's just about time. - Oh, it's a messenger boy. - A telegram. No, no, no, never mind. I'll get it. Ah, the wire we've all been waiting for. The Pioneer Furniture Company. Congratulations, and our furniture sale starts Monday. Easy terms. Oh, Emma. Emma, it's for you. It's probably from Kay. What's wrong, Emma? What's the matter? It's from Ann. She-- She's married Mickey Borden. Let me see that telegram. What does it say? "Dear Emma, you must break the news to Felix. Make him understand that this is for the best. I found out just in time to avoid making a dreadful mistake. Mickey and I will be married by the time this reaches you. Felix will understand and forgive." I'm sorry, son. Well, what are we gonna do? Father? Ben, why don't you do something? Don't stand there looking so helpless. I can't go in there and face all those people. But somebody's got to do something! I'll take care of it. I'm sorry, Reverend Thompson, but the family wanted me to speak to them, to you and to their friends. "Break the news to Felix. Make him understand that this is for the best. Dreadful mistake. Mickey and I will be married by the time..." Oh, this quiet, it hurts my ears. Only one in my orchestra now, Etta. Oh, cheer up. They'll all be here for Christmas. I'm writing to Ann now. Let's continue, Emma. But play it louder. All I ask is a little noise. Darling. Huh? You hate vegetable soup, don't you? No. I kind of like it. For my sake, hate it. Why? I just discovered something about myself. I can't make vegetable soup. Well, could you salvage something from the vegetables? An omelet or a stew or something? I must have done something wrong. Those vegetables in the pot, they disappeared. Well, anyway, we can look forward to the Christmas dinner your dad's gonna give us. I read Aunt Etta's letter again. It gets better with every reading. Uh-huh. We'll go down to Joe's Red Room and get a bite to eat. What are you gonna do for money? We spent the last we had on a couple of tickets for Briarwood. I can get rid of something I don't need any more. Yeah? And after that, what? After that, Social Security will take care of us. I'm afraid not. Although I feel old enough to be eligible. I can't make any money orchestrating. I wish there was something else I could do. Nonsense. A few gray hairs at your temple, you'd make a wonderful bank president. Yeah? I bet you'll be glad to get out of this dungeon for a couple of days. Oh, it isn't so bad. Ann. After all these months, do you still love me? It's only four months. Sure I do. You really do? Get a notary. I'll sign an affidavit. You still love me. You must be crazy. That's a statement that would get you into the most exclusive insane asylum. Listen, you wouldn't do so bad yourself on the entrance exams. Come on, I'm hungry. I don't see it. You don't see it? Now look. You're at the piano, I'm at the drums. Earl here is doubling on trumpet and sax, and Sammy's with the fiddle. I tell you, its a cinch. Sure. We could clean up, have a lot of fun in the bargain. Say, there's where you have a lot of fun, in South America. How do you know? You ever been there? No, but I've seen postcards, ain't I? South America. Sounds interesting. Say, what kind of lightning they got down there? Lightning? Oh, they must be lulus. You know, that's a topical country. The tropical. Topical means right now, up-to-date. Was I wrong? What's so old-fashioned about South America? What is all this? Wouldn't mind change. What would it cost to get there? Now, you listen to me, Michael Bolgar. Uh, with or without the missus? Well, um... No snap judgments now. With. Thanks. With? Oh, 2 or 300 smackers. Of course, that's second class. That's the end of South America. When I was in Washington, I walked through the mint. That was the first and last time I've ever seen $300. Ain't you got anything you could hock? Well, uh, what do you get for wives these days? Well, she'd bring more than the average. Thank you. If one of my three sisters was a brother, you'd all have black eyes. More coffee? One check. I wanna recapture that feeling, walking through the mint again. Mickey. Try and dig up the dough, will you? You know, we want you with us. Well, goodbye, Mrs. Borden. Goodbye. Oh, yeah. Merry Christmas. Eh, merry Christmas. Come on, Earl. Come on. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Thanks for paying the bill. Sure. Say, maybe I can wangle $300 out of bank Crowley. Mickey, you'll do no such thing. It'll be a strictly legal wangle. I'd promise to pay 6 per cent and sign all the papers he shoved in front of me. Oh, you can't, Mickey. You can't. Well, why not? He's in the family, isn't he? He sneaked in through marriage. We didn't charge him for it and we don't intend to. Listen, Mickey, unless you promise you won't speak to Ben, I won't go home. Okay, okay. I promise I won't ask him. I'll go further. I'll offer to loan him money. Here. Have a cigarette. Thanks. Now it's my turn to ask you something. These last four months, have you been happy? I've been closer to it than I've ever been before. Then why do you wanna go to South America? Perhaps to give its lightning a chance at me. Only fair. If you weren't married to me, if I wasn't around your neck, you'd got there somehow, wouldn't you? Stowaway or something. Matter of fact, two can stow away as cheaply as one. No, Ann. If I go, I wanna go in some sort of style. What's up? I was just wondering if I found a wallet in the street or something, I was just wondering if I'd be a big enough of a heel to run out on you. How are you betting? Nothing I would do would surprise me. Make that two. Here we are. Stick close to me, Ann, will you? I feel kind of funny. Thanks, Ernest. It was nice of you to meet us. All I know is I got my orders. Oh, I see. Emma's bullying you even before you're married. Something fierce, but I'm thriving on it. Wait, Mickey, I want Ernest to carry all the suitcases. It'll put him in trim to wash the dishes. There. You see what I mean? Well, you certainly have him under control. This is nothing. Wait till we're married. He'll do the cooking then. Yeah, but will I eat it? It's cold. Get in. Get in. Let me in on this, Ann. It looks like a good thing. Hello, Ben. May I? I'm very glad you could get here, Mickey. I'm glad to be here. Hello, Lemp. Hello, Deitz. How are you, Ann? Fine. Well, how's he been acting since he won the prize? There's no living with him. He walks about with a check in his lapel, a contract with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra pinned to his hair. Shades of Sebastian Bach. Come along, let's have some Tom and Jerry. - Boy, do I need that. - Because it's cold. Merry Christmas, Thea. I want you to see the Christmas tree. Hello, Mickey. Merry Christmas. Oh, same to you, Felix. Congratulations on winning the prize. Thanks. Don't forget, your orchestrating helped a lot. Beethoven did his own. He didn't need any help. He was a musician. Christmas cheer, Mickey. Oh, thank you. Would you like some, Felix? Yes, thanks. Where's Kay? Isn't she here yet? Poor Kay. She's gonna miss this. We got a surprise for you. Kay can't get here. Why not? Well, she couldn't be in Briarwood and sing over the radio at the same time now, could she? Oh, Aunt Etta. Is Kay going to sing on the radio? Yes, indeed. Tonight. National network. We've sent her a wire telling her how wonderful she was. Isn't that great? Kay on a national hookup. Well, what have you got to say now? I haven't a word to say until I've had my dinner. Dinner. That turkey ought to be ready by now. Why, Ernest! That will cost you two dozen roses. Well, there's no point in wasting this good mistletoe. In love and war, surprise is half the battle. Oh, now, Ben, don't be silly. Here's my chance. I've been wanting to kiss you for months. Lemp, the Latin lover. Aunt Etta, come here! Now, shoulders back. Chin up. It took a long time, but my charm finally got him. Aunt Etta! Dinner's ready. Dinner is served. Come and get it. Come and get it. Finally. And we have cranberry sauce.

He's just being modest. Well, let him be modest about his own flute playing then, and not about our Kay's singing. I'm too old to change. Oh, too old Musicians are all like that. I remember when I was a boy. There was a musician lived next door to us. The most eccentric-- Well, I'll have to be running along. There's just time enough to make my train. So soon, Felix? Yes. I really must. Why, Felix. Ernest, his bag! Alright, alright. I'll get his bag. You know, I've heard of henpecked husband but this is the first I've heard of a henpecked fiancé. I'm the youngest. I'll get his coat and hat. I'd like to tell you about that musician who lived-- I'll start with the prettiest. Goodbye, Aunt Etta. I'm so sorry to have you leave, Felix. Can't you miss your train? They'll never believe that you're a great musician in Seattle if you get there on time. Goodbye, Adam. Felix. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Emma. - Goodbye, Felix. - Goodbye, Thea. - Good luck. - No, Ben. - No trouble at all. I can use the fresh air. We'll just hop in Thea's car. We'll expect a letter every week, a full report. I'll send press clippings for your father. Make sure he reads them. Bah! I'll hurry Ernest up. Poor boy, what's he's in for marrying me! Oh. Here you are. I hope it's your coat. Well, if it doesn't fit it's mine. It's plenty cold out. Be sure your scarf's up around your neck. It's up there. Whoever said "out of sight, out of mind" is a liar. Probably Shakespeare. He said everything. Goodbye, Lemp. So long, Deitz. Hurry up, Ernest. Here you are, Felix. Thank, Ernest. Goodbye and have a nice trip. Goodbye, Emma. Goodbye, Felix. Mind if I drive Felix to the station? I got something to say to him. Sure, go ahead, Mickey. Drop me off at the drug store. I wanna get some cigars. I'll walk back. Walk off some of this Christmas dinner. Thanks. I just thought I'd drive you down. We haven't much time. Oh, I'll step on it. Well, you fellows get in. I'll sit on the outside. I'm gonna get off at the store. You don't mind? Oh, no, of course not. Oh, that's fine. I asked Ben to let me drive you down because this is the last chance I'd have to tell you I'm sorry I messed things up for you. Ancient history, Mickey. Forget it. Busting things up, that's where I shine. There's one saving grace, though. I usually end up at the bottom of the pile. How have things been going with you? No complaints. Been working? After my fashion. Everything alright then? Sure. Saw Jake yesterday. We were talking about you. He said-- Jake's a bigger liar than I am. Do me a favor, Mickey. How much you need? I've been lucky lately. Let me lend you a little something, tide you over. Say, don't you ever get tired of being such a swell guy? It would bore me stiff. Thanks, Felix. But I can't take it. Why not? I don't know. Maybe it's because I'm a new man. The old Mickey would've taken it. The old Mickey was no fool. Well, there's your train. Porter! You better hurry. Behind the seat, porter. All aboard! All aboard! So long, Felix. Thanks. Here you are. Mickey! Yeah? Here. Something for Ann. Use it any way you think will make her happy. Bye, Mickey! But wait a minute. It was too bad Kay couldn't get here. But then it was so wonderful hearing her voice. Yes. The things we've crowded in since last Christmas. This time last year, Thea wasn't married, and you weren't married. Kay hadn't won her scholarship, Felix hadn't won his prize. Oh, we didn't even know Felix then. Emma, I've got to know. What? You and-and Felix. I thought you were in love with him. I was. I guess we all were. And looking back that day you were gonna marry Felix, I thought if the world should come to an end, it would just be an anticlimax. I know better now. And I really owe it all to you, Ann. To me? You see, if you'd married Felix, why, I suppose I'd have gone on all my life thinking I'd missed my Prince Charming on his white horse. And when your telegram came, everyone just went to pieces. That is everyone but Ernest. Ben, who blows the loudest trumpet, he couldn't do a thing. I'll never get over the way Ernest took hold. He was so quiet, capable. So dignified. Well, that started it. Now, I can't imagine life without me ordering Ernest around. And if Ernest gets to the point of ordering me around, that'll be alright too. It's funny how long you can be around people and not know how much they really mean to you. Take you and Mickey, for instance. Oh, gracious, Ann. You're not crying about a broken plate. You don't have to, it isn't ours. We borrowed it from Mrs. Ridgefield. Oh, it isn't that. It's-it's just being home and everything. Ann? If you're going to ask me if I'm happy, I am. Why, it never entered my mind. Mickey's done everything to make me happy. He-- He's trying very hard. Of course. Of course. Thea, please. Thea, what's wrong? What's happened to you? It's Ben. He's had an accident. Could you be quiet just a minute, please? Huh? I can't hear you. Darling. Shh! St. Joseph's Hospital? Alright. I'll-I'll bring his wife with me. Is he badly hurt? I'm afraid so. There-- My car's outside. I'll go with you, Thea. Please, don't. Poor Ben. I didn't make him happy. I didn't even try. Thea, you mustn't. But he's always been so kind and generous. I never showed any appreciation. Ben will be alright. It isn't too late. You'll have a chance to make it all up to him. But suppose-- Suppose-- Oh, Thea, please. You mustn't. Thea, it's not Ben. Ann, it's... Mickey? Mm-hm. He was driving Ben's car. Is he hurt badly? Mickey. Huh? Mickey. Ann. More of their work. Why, they wouldn't let me go out in style. Oh, don't try to talk. You'll be alright. Only lightning can get you, I have your word for it. Lightning can be manufactured. You know? Oh, Mickey. I think perhaps it's better if you-- I know his type. Got a cigarette? Could I? Yes, alright. Here you are. Cork tip. No. Mickey. Oh, no! Mickey. Oh, Mickey.

Hello, Deitz. I've done right by my gate. Listen to that squeak. I wouldn't swing on a gate that didn't squeak. Why is it women hate to use an oil can? Why do men smoke smelly pipes? It isn't the pipe. It's tobacco. Stonewall Jackson Cut Plug? Right. I've chewed it for years. I've smoked it for years. I dislike it intensely. Ann? Oh, I'm so glad you're home. What am I doing on this side of the gate? Say, this is where we came in. Yes.
