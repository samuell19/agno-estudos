And then, um... stimulus control therapy... cognitive behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene, relaxation training, and biofeedback. Anything else? Probably. And none of these traditional forms of treatment have proven effective? No, no. Um, that's actually why I'm here. You know, what you described in your intake forms, a recurring dream, is not all that unusual a phenomenon in and of itself. Well, I've had this dream 4,476 times. Yes, that part is a bit unusual. Have you ever encountered a condition like mine? Well, most of my patients are suffering from more common sleep disorders. Insomnia, parasomnia, hypersomnias. Right. Most of my patients. To answer your question, yes, I have treated a few people who were experiencing symptoms like yours. How like mine? Very. There is a treatment I have administered in the past, a form of hypnosis, for lack of a better term, which greatly assisted those others I mentioned who were suffering from a similar defect. Defect? Sorry, poor choice of words. The treatment is very effective. It will eliminate your recurring dream. You know that other therapists before, they said that they could help, but nothing ever changed. I will help you. The dream will go away. But... But? Unless we have a thorough understanding of why you are having it, after some time has passed, the dream will come back. Okay, so how do we... Like you said, I mean, how do we figure out why I'm having it? Well, we start by having you recount it for me in as much detail as possible. It, uh... It takes place in the house where I grew up. It can help sometimes to close your eyes. Okay, so like I said, I'm in the house where I grew up. I'm in the kitchen. My mom is there cooking dinner. She asks me if I can run and ask my dad if he remembered to get garlic when he went to the store. Sorry to interrupt. Is this a memory? I don't really know. I, uh... Probably. I-I used to watch my mom cook sometimes, but... Interesting. Go on. Uh, eyes open or closed? Up to you. Okay. Uh, so... then I run down the hallway... to the bedroom... and my dad is there watching football on TV. And? And that's it. That's... That's where I wake up. It is extremely mundane. There is one strange thing about it. What is it? It's this... The thing is, before I get to the bedroom, there... there's... Hanging from the ceiling is a red string. An attic? Yeah. Why is that strange? Because there was no attic in the house where I grew up. You're certain of this? Yes. Could there have been one and you were just unaware of it? I mean, I-I lived in that house for 18 years. You know, I-I ran up and down the hallway a thousand times. Uh, when I was 14 or so and the dream was driving me fucking crazy, I actually got a ladder and I took a hammer to the ceiling right in that spot. I just tore open the drywall, but I didn't find anything. Just insulation and wood. I see. So, um... that's why I'm here. Yes. It is. Here you go. Thank you. I'm sorry to bother you. My name is Harrison Hardy. I'm moving in today. We spoke on the phone last week. Actually, I have my security deposit here. I don't remember. Oh, yeah. I remember now. Ah. Hold on. Huh. Come with me. What... I thought you said it was furnished. Well, there's a bed, and a fridge, toilet. What you fucking want? Martha Stewart? No, you're right. It's great. It's, uh... It's perfect, actually. Um, where's the laundry room? Basement. Thanks. See ya! See ya. Oh. Did you hear or read anything about this building online? Um, just that it was cheap and furnished. Mmm. Fuck that. Fuck that. Harrison, can you go ask your dad if he remembered to get garlic when he went to the grocery store? Okay. It is half past-00. I'm gonna move your clothes. That's it. I cannot wait all day for this shit. Ten more minutes. Ten more minutes. I mean, would I be pissed? No. But then I would come get my clothes out when they're done. What are you gonna do, leave them in there all day? They're just gonna get mildewy and gross. Yeah, all right. Yeah. I'd totally understand. I would totally understand. I'd get it. I'd love that. Okay. Is that my laundry? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I was just... I was gonna move it to the dryer... Are you okay? Yeah, I... Sorry. Um... I'm Maria. You must be Harrison Hardy. What? The new tenant in 429? Um, yeah. I'm in 630. Right above you, two floors up. May I? Oh. Yeah. Yeah. How are we liking the Lafayette so far? Um... You know, it's, uh... It's a little strange, to be honest. Hmm. So, where are you from, Harry? Uh, Riverside. Oh. Never been. Know anyone in the city? Well, I know you. Well, I'm very interested to know how you ended up at the Lafayette. Um, well, I just... I was looking for a place that was cheap and furnished. Well, I know what it's like being new in town. You don't know anybody. Lonely, sad. Um, so, if you want to come up to my place later, maybe have some dinner and some drinks. I can... answer any questions you have about this place. Oh, yeah. I mean... Yeah, that... that... that sounds great. That'd be really nice. You eat meat? Yeah. Or unless you don't. I don't have to. I love meat. I'll make steaks. Great. Good evening. Harry.Hey. Come in. Welcome to my place. Would you like the tour? Sure. You like that, huh? It's been in my family for generations. Really? Mm-hmm. No idea who it is, though. Probably my great-aunt Marion. Interesting. Oh. Thanks. So why are you here? What... You invited me over. At the Lafayette, I mean. Oh. Uh, well, I... I just found it online. I just needed something that was cheap and furnished. The Lafayette collects unusual people. What? So what about you? What makes you unusual? Wow, you're... you're just... You're, like, really direct, you know. It's, um... I mean, we just... we just met. Right. I mean, I-I just don't really like to talk about it with anybody. Okay, well, it's... Uh, I have a... I just have this, like, sleep thing. Sleep thing? What kind of sleep thing? Insomnia, sleepwalking, night terrors, apnea, restless leg syndrome? Oh, no. It's just... It's a dream. A dream? It's a... It's a recurring dream. I've had it about 5,000 times in my life. That seems like a lot.Yeah. I mean, I think so. That's actually... That's why I'm in the city currently. I'm... I'm seeing this new therapist. He's supposed to be like one of the top, uh, som... somnambulists in the world. Somnambulist? Sleep doctor. Yeah. What's the dream? It's really weird. Uh... Uh, it's this thing where I am... I'm... I'm in the house where I grew up and then I... It's just... I-I run to ask my dad something and then on my way to... To ask him, there's an... I see this attic out of the corner of my eye, but there was no attic in the house. It's fucking weird. It doesn't make any sense. Ah, like the house on Ash Tree Lane. What? So this therapist, he's gonna help you understand why you keep having the dream? Help you figure out what's in your nonexistent attic? Maybe. I mean, it's... He said that he's helped people like me before, so... Well, I wonder if I could help you. Oh. I mean, I really appreciate that, but it's actually... It's one of those things I've... I've just, um... I've been struggling with it for a long time. I mean, it's kind of... affected my entire life. Would you say that understanding your dream is the thing you want more than anything else in the entire world? Sure. Maybe, or just not having it anymore. Have you tried acid? What? No, why? You think that will help? Oh. I don't really smoke, but thanks. Uh, do you mind if I use your restroom? Thanks. Okay. You're really pretty. Like an actress or something. I am an actress. What, really? Mm-hmm. Have you been in anything I might have seen? No. Cool. It's getting late. Oh, yeah. No, you're right. I should, uh... I should probably get going. I didn't say you needed to go. Just making an observation. Okay. Yeah, you probably should. Yeah. I had a dream once. I was in a house on a beach and I was lying in bed. And I was so sure, absolutely, completely sure, that out on the sand outside this house was a black horse. I was so positive there was a horse out there, even though there was no reason for there to be a horse. And so in the dream, I just couldn't take it anymore. I got out of bed and I marched to the window and I looked out on the sand. And there was a horse? Cool. You can come over tomorrow night if you want. Maybe I can help you figure out what's in your dream attic. Okay.Okay. Good night! Harrison, can you go ask your dad if he remembered to get garlic when he went to the grocery store? Hey, hey. Wait. Wait! Okay, so... I have some serious questions about this apartment complex. I bet you do. Okay, first of all, room 408. There's this weird sound coming out of that room, so I actually got closer to the... I touched the door. Jesus. I can't talk about 408. Okay, well... Really? I don't... Okay, well, this morning I was, um... I... I was up on the roof, uh... There was this girl. Charmagne. Yeah, she was, um... Singing? Yeah. She was really good too. But what was with the mask? Charmagne has the most beautiful face. So much so that anyone who looks at it, man or woman, they just fall head over heels in love with her. And so she wears the mask, so that people don't fall in love with her all the time. Maybe that's probably for the best then, you know? Yeah. Um... Okay, last but not least... Mm-hmm. Last night... there was a guy floating... in the lobby. Elliot. Yeah, so, like, what's... What's his story? He floats. I have to pee. He floats. Hey, you know, there's a... There's a book in the middle of your floor. Might want to move it. It's kind of a hazard, don't you think? Someone could trip on it. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Huh? A very powerful wizard used to live here before me. And when he left, he left this book. And he told me if anyone were to read even one line from it, they'd drop dead on the spot. And you really believe that? Didn't you hear me? I said, a very powerful wizard. Uh, I don't know. I've heard you can have kind of a crazy reaction to it, you know, like lose your mind or something so... Open. Okay. Open. Harry, don't you know I'd never let anything bad happen to you? Harrison, can you go ask your dad if he remembered to get garlic when he went to the grocery store? I can just wait for the next one. No. There is no next one. You spend the night with Maria last night? How did you... Her smell is on you. All over you. Hmm. Uh... So... But, um, yeah, it was... it was really good talking to you, man. Yeah. You too. So, I'll just catch you later. Oh, you're... Yeah, well... Okay. So, this is what the units on this side of the building look like. Uh, yeah. Yup. Sorry, I don't have any beer or anything. Hey. I work at the nature center downtown. You ever been? Uh... I look after the Arakan forest turtles. Oh. Sweet. Nice. Ever heard of 'em? Uh, no, I can't say I have, actually. That's because they're one of the most endangered species on the planet. Oh. Well, then how many do you guys have at the nature center? Two.Oh. Guess how many are left in the entire world. Um... Two.Oh. The last two. Wow, that's... That's really sad. I mean, you know, that they're almost ex... Don't say that. Come on. Be positive, man. Yeah. All right. But yeah. It's pretty goddamn sad. The two that we have are male and female, the actual last of their species. So as you can imagine, the most important aspect of my job is trying to convince them to breed. You know how stressful that is? I got a lot of problems in my life, you know? Girls, money, health. It's easy to just leave my job at work and forget about it. But then I think, "The continued existence" of an animal that's been living on this planet for tens of thousands of years is my sole responsibility. "What are my problems compared to that?" I have to get those two turtles to fuck. It's the most important thing in the world. Do they not want to? How the hell am I supposed to know? I can't exactly ask them. They're turtles. Right, I'm just wondering if they seem, um... Interested in each other. I do everything I can to make their surroundings as comfortable as possible. I put a little bed in their tank, you know? I put leaves on it. I tried playing sexy music for 'em, even. Does any of that work? Hasn't yet. Shit. I really hope that works out. You hope that it works out? Yeah. You hope that this species continues to exist on this planet? How kind of you. Next time things are going bad for you, and you have some big problem that's so important... remember those turtles. Okay. The dream changed. Just... Just a tiny, tiny bit. I, uh... I... I glanced up at the string. Directly at it. And that was it. And this was right after your evening with... What was her name? Maria. I see. What do you think happened? I don't... know for certain. Your condition is very rare. Condition? What? Well, you're experiencing the... dream symptom. Very... serious... illness. It is? Yes. And it... I'm surprised it didn't occur to me earlier. What? Your whore friend Maria. What? What? What did you say? What did you just say? What... What's wrong? It sounded like you... Did you just call Maria a whore? No, of course not. Why on earth would I have done that? I said, "Your friend Maria." What about her? Nothing. Nothing. It's just curious that... that you would meet her now. The timing of it all. No matter. I think that on your next visit, we should start the treatment. I think you're ready. The hypnosis? Okay. Um... You said you wanted to understand the dream better before we did that. I think I do now. One sec. Coming! Coming, coming, coming, coming. Hey! Aw! Cute place.Thanks. Uh, I haven't really had a chance... Have I told you about my friends Lauren and Oliver? They live in 201.Uh... No, I don't think so. Lauren's my best friend and Oliver, well... Oliver's a fucking prick.Yeah. You'll meet them soon. Lauren works for Rory Calhoun. You obviously know who that is. No, I don't, actually. Oliver just loves the theater. I mean, you wouldn't expect it. So last month they came to see me at the center in Ruston. It was Cymbeline... but with lesbians. Which, now that I think about it, is kind of ironic. Anyway, they brought Rory, and I guess Rory liked my performance and was super impressed with me. So he wanted me to send him something of me on tape, because he thinks I might be right for a role in his upcoming film. I mean, can you believe that? Oh, wow. That's amazing. He's interested. That's so cool. In me. I'm sorry, but I don't know who he is. This is the most important thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life. Do you want me to help make the video? Yes, I want you to help operate. Okay. Okay, I don't really know how to do this. Yeah, you press record, and then you press stop. And, uh, say "action." Okay.Okay. Okay. Wait. One second. How's it look? Yeah, it look... it looks great. Are you ready? And action! I was continuing to shrink. To become... what? The infinitesimal? What was I? Still a human being. Or was I a man of the future? In that moment, I knew the answer to the riddle of the infinite. You see, I had thought in terms of man's own limited dimension. I had presumed upon nature. That existence begins and ends is man's conception, not nature's. And I felt my body dwindling. Melting. Becoming nothing. My fears melted away. And in their place came acceptance. All this vast majesty of creation. Surely, it had to mean something. And then I meant something too. Yes. Smaller than the small, I meant something too. Say "cut." Oh, cut. Hmm. Oh. How was that? I don't know what to say. No... I think it was perfect. Really? Yeah. Okay, well, if I need to do another take, I know where to find you. I'll be here. Now I have to go get ready for my party tonight. Oh, my God. I didn't tell you I'm having a party tonight, huh? Um, no, I don't think so. Would you like to come to my party tonight? I would be honored. Yeah, sure. Ah! Great. What time? We're gonna have so much fun. Now that I have this done, I feel better. What time? Oh! Maria, you... You left your shoes. Simone, darling. Hi.Hey. Thank you for coming. Yeah, this is great. Oh! Have you gotten a drink yet? Uh, no, not yet. Remember I told you about Lauren and Oliver? Yeah. They're here. Do you want to meet them? Sure. Come on. She told me she was gonna be here. Lauren? Hello, gorgeous.Hi. Will Oliver be joining us? Yeah, 20 minutes or so, I reckon. Oh, soon. Yeah. I hear him whispering already. This is Harrison Hardy. The one with the sleep thing. And this is Lauren Reitz. And this is Oliver Black. It is so nice to meet you, Harrison. Maria's told me such great things. Uh, I'm sorry, Lauren Reitz and, uh... What was it? Oliver.Oliver. Lauren shares her body with a 55-year-old British man named Oliver Black. Fifty-six. His birthday was last week. A Gemini? Yeah. Well, then it's very nice to meet the two of you, I guess. I'm gonna get you a drink. What do you want? A cocktail? Um... Just a beer is fine. Sure. Thank you. Just a bit of advice. I wouldn't let them get your drink. Lauren is trustworthy, but Oliver will roofie you. And I'd be careful what I say about one to the other. Because I'm not entirely sure what they can and can't hear. If you know what I mean.I... Isn't she cute? Here you go. Thank you. So, welcome to Lafayette. Settling in? Um... Kind of, yeah. Tell me about this dream thing. Sounds interesting. You know, I'd really rather not. It's... It's pretty embarrassing. Come on. We're all a little embarrassing here. Yeah, she's always trying to set me up with guys. I appreciate it, you know, but tell her she's got to stop. And I know she means well, but I'm a fucking lot to handle. Oh, no. You seem great. That's really sweet of you to say. But you haven't met him. Tell me, though, if I wasn't possessed by an old British man, would you be attracted to me? I... You're very pretty. I try to look on the bright side, you know? At least I only have one interloper. I mean, I could be like Truddi Chase. He is the interloper, though, right? What does this body look like to you? Uh, what? Uh, it... You look like a young woman. A beautiful young woman? Um, I'd say so, yes. There you go. He does like to watch me have sex. It makes it really hard to focus. Uh, hmm. Hmm. I'm gonna go get another. You want one? I'm good here. Thank you. Pardon me. Have you seen my sister? I can't seem to find her anywhere. Hmm. No, I'm... I'm sorry. I can't. I don't know where your sister is. Look at this. Hey! Oh, fuck. You smoking inside? Fuck is it to you? Oh! If it ain't the prick who's scheming to get into little Lauren's knickers. Let me save you the fucking sweet talk. A slam dunk. Come on. Take a sniff, sniff, sniff. Stop, don't do that. Don't. Come on. Wow, you must be Oliver. And you must be "who gives a fuck?" Okay, so when... When you're here, Lauren is completely unavailable? What do you care? I... I just enjoy talking to her. She seems nice. She's a cunt just like you.Okay. Well, she seems nice. Oh, yeah, you'd know better than me, wouldn't you? What, you've known her 30 minutes? And I've lived inside her for 30 years. Oh, you've been inside her that long? Got another fag, fag? It must be really hard. Yeah, of course it's hard. What, you think I like giving blow jobs and being buggered? What, I look like a fucking homo to you? What I want to do is shove my cock up her friend Maria's arse and make her scream.Okay. But guess what? I ain't got no cock. What about you? You aren't horny? Stop! Come on, knock it off. Jesus. Where have I seen you before? You say you've never been to Sussex? No. Can't say I have. Oh, that's right. It was a photograph. I'll never forget a face as ugly as yours. If Lauren finds you attractive, she's even dumber than I thought. Wait, did you say photograph? Yeah. Mutual acquaintance showed it to me. Who? I ain't saying. She might be listening. Maria. Hey. Leave me alone. It's you. I'm sorry you didn't find me sooner. Mmm. So, how are the turtles? Still virgins. Fuck. That sucks, man. It does. You know what's total fucking bullshit? What's that? Everything. I'm serious. Like, what the fuck are we doing here? You know, we're on this planet, what, 80 years? And that's it? Like, what is that? It's fucking nothing. I mean, in the grand scheme of the whole universe, you know what that is? That is a goddamn fart in the wind. You know what? Actually, it's not even a fart. We're... It... It's a shadow of a fart. You and I are shadows of a fucking fart in the wind. It's not enough time, you know? I don't wanna die. I wanna live forever. I mean, I like myself, David. I don't wanna know myself for just a shadow-fart span. It's not enough, you know? I like me. I like who I am. I don't wanna die. Just everything... everything we are... everything we own... these... these bodies, our memories... everyone we know, all goes away in the end. And we're just... What? Yeah, exactly.Man... you got some dark thoughts inside that head. Yeah. Excuse me, Rory. There's some people here to see you. Who are they? I thought I had no meetings this afternoon. You know I've been working on that counteroffer. 'M sorry. They're on their way. Wow, what? Hey, no. Shit. Hello, Rory. The arrangements we made previously seem suitable. Mm-hmm. I require your assistance in a new matter. Nothing too strenuous, I assure you. You promised me. I'm sorry, you were saying? Nothing. Right. I require your assistance in a new matter. Nothing too strenuous, I assure you. Just a simple procurement. Your involvement will be minimal. Listen... I know what our arrangement is. But you told me I fulfilled my obligation. You had, but this current development was... unexpected. I still have fucking nightmares about the last time. I know. So you can't just... just, uh... come in here and ask me to help you. Again, I'm... I'm really busy. I'm busy. And I-I have been working on this counteroffer. I understand. I do, however, have one question. Where am I? Who the fuck are you? Tell me, Rory... do you enjoy existing? Hey. Hey! You look amazing. Really? I'm so nervous. Don't be. Rory's a sweetheart. You're gonna love him. I hope he likes me. Come on.Okay. Yeah. Get me someone. Anyone. Hey, Maria. Come on. Help me. Hello? Help me. Help me. Hello? Help me. Help me, help me, help me, help me... Help me, help me, help me, help me... Hello? Help me. Hel... Help me. Hello? 911, what's your emergency? Hi, um... Actually I don't know if it's an emergency, but I just got a call from a friend and I think she might be in some kind of danger. Please hold. Oh... Yeah. Okay. Help me. H-Hello? Harry, help me. Hello? Rory Calhoun's office. How can I help you? Shit. Rory Calhoun. Oh, my God. Okay, okay, okay... Rory Calhoun's office. Hello? Yeah. Hello. How can I help you? Um, I actually got a strange call from this number. Who am I speaking with? Who am I speaking with? Please hold. No, wait, wait, wait. Sorry for the wait. I've got Mr. Calhoun for you now. Wait, what? No, no, no. No. Please don't. Help me. Maria? Harry, help me. Maria, is... is that you? Hello? Hello, Harrison. Good to see you.Hi. Um... Something really strange is going on. I don't know, uh... Something like... Maria might be in some sort of trouble. How so? I don't... I don't know. Never mind. It's... We're supposed to do the... The hypnosis today? We are.Okay. Well, I should tell you then, the dream, it continued to expand. This time I-I... I pulled down the string, I climbed up the ladder and I actually peeked into the attic. I-I... see, and wh... What was in there? Photographs. Boxes of them, like these... you know, those old-style Polaroid photos? There were just stacks of them. And did you look at any of them? Yeah. Uh, there... there were pictures of people, uh... Some... Some of them I recognized, but mostly strangers. I see. Well, I think we should begin with this treatment. Are you ready? Sure. Close your eyes. What I am going to do now is give you a riddle. It will only take a moment and when I'm finished, you will undergo a change. But you must pay very close attention and do not interrupt me once I start. Do you understand? Yes, but, uh, before we start, what did you mean the other day when you said it was curious that I met her now? I'm not sure I understand. You said it was curious that I met Maria now. The timing of it all. Let's discuss that further after we've begun the hypnosis. Okay. And you definitely didn't call her a whore? I definitely did not. She's quite pleasant, I'm sure. Okay. Three brothers are traveling and stop at an inn one night and ask for a room. The cost of the room is... Is... That scared the fuck out of me. I am so sorry. It's fine. I swore I turned that fucking ringer off. I have no idea what that was. Let's begin. Three brothers are traveling and stop at an inn one night, and ask for a room. The cost of the room is 30 gold pieces. Each brother pays ten gold pieces. I thought you said you turned it off. I did. I did. Clearly, it's... It must be malfunctioning. I'll have Cindy buy a new one. Answer it. Excuse me? Pick it up. It... It's unplugged. Clearly, it's broken. Answer it. Answer it, please. No. Answer it or we won't be able to continue with your riddle. I'll just... put it outside. Help me. Harrison, wait! Maria? Maria! Lauren, hey. Uh, I was actually gonna come and try and find you. Maria's gone. I went to her apartment and it's completely empty. Do you know what's going on? Smells like moldy cheese in here. Wait, did you hear what I said? Maria... Maria's gone. She's in trouble or something. This place could definitely use a woman's touch. If I happen to meet one, I'll be sure to let her know. Are either of you even listening to me right now? Maria's fine! I just seen her the other day at Rory Calhoun's office. Dressed like a whore, she was. She's probably under his desk right now. No. Okay, well, I was actually just up at her apartment and it's completely empty. Well, ain't that a shame. Hmm. Guess she moved out then. Too bad. I guess I never get to fuck her after all. No, moved out? What? She's not moved out. What do you mean, "moved out"? What you mean, "what do I mean"? She fucking moved. Probably get far away from your annoying arse. It ain't her they're really after. Wait, what do you mean? Whoa. Whoa. Hold on. What are you doing? What are you doing? I ain't gonna pretend like I understand what this is all about, but there's some people you just can't say no to. What? Well, they can't come in here. So they needed someone... on the inside. Whoa. Okay. Oh, I'm gonna see if I can remember this properly. Three brothers are traveling along a road and they come to an inn where they plan to stay the night. Wait, wait, stop. What? How do you know that? Let me finish. Please. The cost of the room is 30 bites of gold, so each of the brothers put in ten apie... Sorry about that. As I was saying, it's ten apiece so the manager wants to give them a discount of five gold... pieces. What the bloody fuck are you doing? What are you doing? So he gives five... gold pieces to the bellboy to take back to... Stop it! Just calm down, both of you. Just... The bellboy says he can't split five evenly... among three. Take it easy. Jesus Christ. Bloody fucking hell. FuckYou all right? Just run, run, run! All right, I'm just... Lauren works for Rory Calhoun. You obviously know who that is. Maria's fine. I just seen her the other day at Rory Calhoun's office. Dressed like a whore, she was. What the fuck. Oh! I know. I know, I know. I'm sorry about all of this. But I got the call earlier today and when they call, I have to answer. Because everyone in this world has to answer to somebody, right? Well, except for... him. But then... this world, am I right? Where's Maria? I'm sorry. Who's Maria? Come on! What the fuck is going... Please. You know, Maria. Where's... Oh, oh, Maria. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That girl. That... That actress who sent me in that really weird tape. Her? Yeah. Yeah, okay. How the hell should I know? I can't possibly cast her in anything. Why do you keep calling me? Who's the woman on the phone? Listen, I don't have the answers you're looking for, pal. Okay? So, I am just doing what I'm told. Now... She was... She was... We really gotta go. Please, no, no! See ya, Harry. Yup, see you soon. Thank you, Rory. Your services are no longer needed. I did try to do it the easy way. You can close your eyes if you like. Three brothers are traveling along a road one night. They stop at an inn and the cost for the inn is 30 gold pieces. They each pay ten. The manager decides to give them a discount. Perhaps the inn isn't too crowded that night. He gives five gold pieces to a bellhop and tells him to return it to the men. The bellhop decides he cannot divide it evenly between the three, so he pockets two for himself and returns one gold piece to each of the men. Each man gets back one gold piece. So now they've given nine apiece. Nine, three times, is 27. The bellhop pocketed two. Add that to the 27 and you've got 29. But you started with 30. Where is the missing piece? I hope you know that this is absolutely not personal. The system is mostly infallible. I have no idea who put it into place or why. But it works. You live, you die, you live, you die. You live, you die, and we collect these each time. But sometimes, there is a glitch. Generally, nobody has any idea why it happens, but in your case... it was the girl. Whatever the problem is, when there is one... they send me in to clean it up. You should stand back. So how did your brother meet this girl again? Susanne? Do I call her "Susie"? Um, I don't know. I mean, I-I think she was a friend of a friend, of a friend? Something like that. We shall find out. Do you know where we're going to eat? So Cory cooked. Oh, God. Where should you and I go out to eat after? I was thinking maybe sushi? Did you pay the sitter? Yeah. Did it not go through? She's saying it didn't go through. Likely story. Well, I'll send it again. She's amazing and Ella loves her so much. All right. Ready? Let's do this. Babe, they're here. I heard the knocks. Hey, how are you guys? You look fantastic. Thanks for coming. How you doing, buddy? Are you guys hungry? Starving. Food's almost ready. How about a drink? Let's do it. Yeah, well, what is this? What did you get me? Thank you. Keeping it tight. Nice and fresh...
