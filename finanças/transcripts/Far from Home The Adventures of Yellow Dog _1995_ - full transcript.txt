Angus, did you get it? Now get out of here. Did you get it? Where is it? Where'd it go? I missed it. Why? How'd it get away? Well, it didn't go down there. Didn't go down there, either. Let's go. I'll get him next time. Yeah, you'll get him next time. - Killer chase, though. - The best. - Never going to see that rabbit again. - No way. It was a hare, not a rabbit. Never see that hare again. [Whimpers] [Whimpers] - Hey, guys. - Hi, Sara. - Hi,Angus. -Come on, guys. - Where you going? - Working on the boat. It's in the barn. I haven't seen it yet. - Angus won't let anybody see it. -Yeah, I will. Great boat! When you finally going to finish it? I still got to put the hardware on, set the seats. And paint it. - Angus! - Then you gonna take it out? Maybe next week, if we can, if we finish. Still got to get more money. I can give you some money. I think I'll be O.K. You could probably go to South America in this thing. We're taking it to Winter Harbor. - By yourself? - With my clad. We're going next week. How long will you be away? About 5 days. Dad delivers supplies there twice a year. Going to miss some school. [Angus] So, what are we going to be delivering? Some propane for their float camps and some machine parts for their tractors. Business is picking up, huh, Dad? Watch-- Shift! Shift! I got it. I got it. You're doing fine. Don't give it so much gas. I'm not missing much school. Give it some gas. I got it, O.K.? Angus! Angus, clutch! Yeah, yeah, I know. I shouldn't have hit the gas and shifted. That's right. I got it. We're O.K. We'll be gone 4 days. Get your work done before. Angus! Uh-oh! Damn! I just stacked it yesterday. Too bad it was stacked so neat. [Dog Barks] [Panting] [Whimpers] Good dog. Oh, he looks a little thin. Coat's kind of rough. Guys, it's got to belong to someone. He don't have a collar or nothing. He doesn't have a collar or anything. He hasn't got a home. He could be lost. Dogs don't get lost. We'll call the animal shelter and ask-- They'll put him to sleep. We'll ask if anybody's reported a missing animal. He probably belongs to some summer people. Can we have this dog? [Whimpers] We'll put an ad in the paper, and we'll phone around. Yes! We'll see what happens. But it stays outside. He will. He takes so long. Get the ball! Don't let the dog get it. Oh, not the sheets! Don't let him get away. This is going to be a problem. Grab him! Pull his face and open his mouth. Let go of the sheet. Don't let him rip it. - [Tearing] - Ripped it. [Woof] Angus said to stay here. Paper! Collecting! [Barking] No! Stop! Angus! Stop. dog! What are you doing? - You told me not to let go of the rope. - Good dog. Come on. Come on. [Silas] Here, chicken, chicken, chicken! Here, chicken, chicken, chicken! - No, Yellow! - Yellow! Yellow, no, don't! No, no, Yellow! - Yellow! - No, no. - Yellow! Don't. - Yellow! Get him, Silas! Why'd you leave the gate open? Look, I don't care how he got out. You were to make sure nothing could get in or out. - It wasn't the dog. - I'm not saying it was. It's not the point. We can't have a dog. I'll take care of him. It's more than that. Come on. I got to clean up after it, buy food for it. When we go someplace, who'll take care of it? We already are someplace. We're not in the city anymore. You're already out 2 chickens, a headlight, not to mention paint for the boat. How much is that-- 130 bucks? You know how much a dog will cost you? _ [Whimpers] _Hmm? We'll keep the dog, and I'll return the paint, if that's O.K. All right. But, Angus, this is your dog. It's your responsibility, is that clear? Yeah. O. K. Here's his collar and license, Angus, and the name tag. It's a good name. It's a good name. Thanks. This dog food has the special offer whistle in it, right? Yeah, that's it. I got that stuff-- Collar... license, and name tag. [Toot] [Barking] [Toot] [Barking] Come on, you got to eat on the porch. Is that search-and-rescue hardware ready to go at any time? Yeah, it always is. Sure hope it's more reliable than this washing machine. When you making another supply run, McCormick? Angus and I will be up the coast next week. We won't want anybody but you looking after us. We spend a lot of time on civilian rescues. What is this, Angus, cedar or fir? - Uh, cedar. Yeah. - Cedar. I put a place to stash stuff for camping. Oh, yeah. That's terrific. O.K.,you build a chimney so that the air can feed your fire underneath. And the rocks are like a windbreak, right? Right. But don't build them too high, or they'll fall over and put out your fire. You got enough to eat, Silas? We got a whole box, Dad. Well, if you run out, there's always bugs. Bugs? Mm-hmm,yeah. Moths and dragonflies, bees... snails, worms, stuff like that. It's all good. That would taste like crap. Well, ants taste like crap. There's too much acid in them, but it's all good protein. You can mix them with berries and stuff. Crush them first so they don't move around. Then it's easier to swallow. They won't squirm back up on you. O.K., I'll see you in the morning. Angus, you're in charge of the fire. - O. K. See you, Dad. - See you, Mr. McCormick. - I'll bring the food in. -O.K. - Oh, here. - Oh, yeah, yeah. Figures you'd be a mooch. Bet you don't even know how to sit. Lie down. Heel. [Whimpers] O. K. O.K., you've got me convinced. I know I'm going to regret this. Good dog. O.K., here's your fishing line and hooks. I got the cook pot, tarp, and the rest of the stuff. - That's your camping kit. - Yep. Oh, and, uh... this goes to the next boat's master. This was your father's. Yes, it was. How old is this? 60, 65 years old. It's still perfect. It's perfect. This is a really good boat, Angus. Bet we could go all the way to China. Where is Winter Harbor, Angus? It's about 200 miles down the coast. You got the direction right, but it's down there. How come I can't go with you? You got to stay here and do the papers, help Mom with the chickens-- Still not old enough, right? Here, this is yours. You can have it. - I can? -Yeah. It's yours. Thanks, Angus. Let me know when you're at Winter Harbor. Yeah. It'll be 3 days up, 2 back, and I'll call you at 7:00 every morning. - Sounds good. - Hey, Angus! It's the girl back again. - I thought I'd missed you. - Sorry. It's O.K. I got here. I made you these. Thank you. They're a little burned, but not much. The stove got out of control for a few minutes. Yeah, they're, uh... thanks. Thanks anyway. There's lots of sugar and stuff, carbohydrates. If you get cold, they'll heat you up. [Engine Starts] L--l got to go. See you when you get back. - See you guys in a week. - O.K. Bye, Sara. - See you later. - Bye. - Bye, Mom. I will. - Bye, baby. Have fun. - Bye. - Bye, Silas. - See you later. - All right, bye. Bye, Yellow Dog. Bye. Dad! Bye' Angus! ' Bye. guys! - Bye! [Yellow Dog Barks] [Ship's Horn Blows] [Yellow Dog Barking] It's cold, gray, and wet. That's too bad. It's great here. It'll probably clear by tonight. Mmm. How are the guys? They're doing fine. Good. Well, we miss you already. Miss you, too. Silas up yet? No, he's still in bed. Tell him I'll talk to him tomorrow. All right, I will. Bye, honey. So we passed Uklulit. It's on, uh, Kaiyaquat. We should make Katella Island in about 3 hours. We'll wait out the weather there before it gets dark. [Whimpers] - Dad. - Thanks. Whoa! Dad? It's, uh, Uquat lighthouse, just offofAnuklsland. So we're, like, an hour away from Katella? Mmm, a little more. Should probably head in sooner. Cormorant calling Dovito Coast Guard radio. [Static] - Do vfto C oasz' Guard radio. - Yeah, we're right offAnuk Island, about 2 hours south of Uquat lighthouse. We need a weather advisory for the next few hours and overnight. [Static] Dovito Coast Guard radio. Dovito Coast Guard radio. Never trust the ocean, Angus. These swells are real big, Dad. We should put in to land, find a safe harbor. Ohh! I got you. Grab the wheel. -I got it, Dad. I got it. -Got it? I got to check my boat. Wait till we get to shelter. ]ust...pull it to starboard here. I got to check my boat. All right.

Fishing lines and hooks. And Sara's cookies. We might get really hungry. I know. We are really hungry. [Barking] Do you mind? Come on. Come on, Yellow. Come on. Good boy. Look,john, he's with the boat. He won't leave it. He'll stay with the boat. Ifit didn't sink, we'll find it. It's a really good boat. Angus built it with Dad. Is that what you're saying, we might not see him? I didn't say that. We don't ever stop a search, McCormick, if there's any hope. You know that. We should go back to the hotel. Hey, Mom,wait up. "As he looked out over the water, "shimmering with the last rays of light, " he waited for the orcas to return. The day the orcas came that summer, the old man died." - Mom? -Yeah? When you die, would you go under the ocean, or maybe... UP into space? Well, I thinkyou'd go to heaven, probably. And then you'd open your eyes and wake up again. No, you don't open your eyes again. It's like sleep, but... well, different. It's forever? Yes, it is. At least you can go visit people whenever you want. "And when the little girl wept for her grandfather, "her mother dried her tears.

I know we should stay in one place, but they haven't seen us for 9 days. They might think we're still in the boat. We haven't caught a fish in days. If we stay here, we 're gonna starve. The lighthouse is 15 or20 miles away. We can get there easy. Dad says to always have a plan. Come on, Yellow. Come on. Come on, Yellow. We ain't getting to the lighthouse this way. We'll find another way. [Airplane Engine] Wait! Wait! I'm sorry, Mr. McCormick, but we've only got enough fuel to get back to base. We'll find him. [Crying] [Whimpers] It's O.K., Yellow. We're going to be O.K. We're going to make it. [Thunder] [Barking] [Barking] Yellow! Yellow! Yellow! Yellow! Good boy. Good dog. [yipping] Shh, shh, shh, shh! We got him. Wait. Wait a second. just leave it. I got him. I got him. It was found some distance from the wreck site, and it may not be his. It's his. He's on the shore. You know, we've crossed and recrossed the shore many times. McCormicKs right. I think he's on shore. Don't worry. We're not stopping. Are we going the right way? Are we going back the way we came, or... I don't know. Maybe you should lead. [Vocal izes] You got six senses, right? - [Woof] - Go home. You got to keep your legs and your feet protected. Your legs are going to be O.K. You got fur. Rescue 4 to base. We've spotted some debris on shore. Could be a campsite. We're going in for a closer look. Good boy. It's going to be O.K. We'll find him. How about a grilled chicken sandwich... with mayonnaise and lettuce and tomato, and a vanilla milk shake... 2 vanilla milkshakes. Some mashed potatoes and-- No, French fries, and macaroni and cheese. I haven't had macaroni and cheese in a while. 15 days is a long time. It's been 4 since we started on land, and the weather hasn't been great. He's good in the bush. McCormicKs taught him a lot of things. We don't actually know that he went inland. So, how long are you going to keep looking? As long as there's a reasonable expectation-- We've got a reasonable expectation that you'll keep looking for a long time. Kath, he didn't mean-- They're not going to stop looking. I didn't say that, Katherine. Look, I'm sorry, but... very often we can't find entire aircraft down in the trees. I mean, eventually we find them, but... well, you know... come with me for a couple of hours. I'll show you what I mean. [caw] [caw] [caw] [Cawi ng] [Barking] Here, it's berries and roots. Come on, it's got protein and fat and stuff. Come on. Come on, here. Here. Come on. Yellow, come on. How far do you think he would get inland-- About a mile a day? No, more than that. Twice that. He thinks maybe we should go back soon. You know, there's nothing else that both of us can do that one of us can't. It's been 17 days. John Gale's a realist. I don't want to go back. [Birds Cawing] [Woof] [Woof] You want to go that way? O.K., we can go that way. [Barking] [Barking] [whimpering] What do you think, Yellow? It's a building or something. Now, how are we going to do this one? Come on, Yellow. Come on. Good boy, Yellow. Come on. Keep going.

Don't worry, Angus. They're still looking for him. Why can't they find him? They almost didn't find you. I want you to try and get some sleep. Things will look better in the morning. I don't want to go to school tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's give it a try. If it doesn't work out, you can take a few more clays off. O.K.? O. K. O. K. So did you eat any of the cookies? Yeah, I had a couple. They were good. I'm going to make you some more. Yeah, well, you know, maybe... next week if you want to. - Really? - Sure. Nobody wants to say it, but you really are a hero, you know. My dog's the hero. He is, too. We've looked for more than 3 weeks now, and I'm really sorry we couldn't find him. It's a--lt's a budget issue, you know. A search like that costs 200,000 a week. They'll spend that much on a boy, but-- I understand, j ohn. What you've done is more than we could ask for. I'll tell you one thing. He was a great dog. [Toot] Dad? He didn't know. He was trying to protect me. He didn't know they were trying to save me. I should've grabbed him or something. I could've pulled him up by his collar. There's nothing you could've done, Angus. Nothing. You know that... don't you? [Toot] [Toot] What if some farmer gets him? He'll take care of him. Your mother's right. You have to have a dog. Are you O.K.? I'm O.K.,yeah. L got to g0- See you tomorrow. [Toot] [Toot] [Woof] Look. It's Yellow! It's Yellow! He's back! Yellow! Yellow!
