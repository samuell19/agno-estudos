STEP NUMBER ONE TO THIS DISCOVERY IS REALIZING GOD'S PLAN. "FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD "THAT HE GAVE HIS ONE AND ONLY SON, "THAT WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH, "BUT HAVE ETERNAL LIFE." [Raj] STEP NUMBER TWO, WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE OUR PROBLEM OF SEPARATION. GOD DID NOT MAKE US ROBOTS TO AUTOMATICALLY LOVE AND OBEY HIM, BUT GAVE US A WILL OF OUR OWN AND THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE. CHOOSING OUR OWN WAY IS SEPARATION FROM GOD. OH, YES! THAT MAKES FOR A DIFFICULTY. [Raj] STEP NUMBER THREE... WHEN JESUS CHRIST DIED ON THE CROSS AND ROSE FROM THE GRAVE, HE PAID THIS PENALTY FOR SIN, AND BRIDGED THE GAP FROM GOD TO ALL PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. STEP NUMBER FOUR... WE MUST TRUST JESUS CHRIST AND RECEIVE HIM AS OUR LORD AND SAVIOR. JESUS SAID, "BEHOLD, I STAND AT THE DOOR AND KNOCK, "IF ANYONE HEARS MY VOICE AND OPENS THE DOOR, "I WILL COME IN." ♪ ♪ [sniffs] [bell tolls] HI! I'M ELLY. YOU LOOK YOU COULD USE A FRIEND.

THE MISSIONARIES WORKED YOU OVER, HUH? VERY LITTLE WAS SAID. IT WAS PERHAPS THE QUALITY OF THEIR LIFE. IN MY THIRD YEAR, I BORROWED A BIBLE FROM THE DESK OF MY TEACHER. HINDUS SPEND THEIR LIVES TRYING TO GET CLOSE TO GOD. IN THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE, I WAS ASTONISHED TO LEARN THAT GOD WANTED TO GET CLOSE TO ME, THAT HE SENT HIS SON TO SHOW US THE WAY.

OKAY, SO... WHERE DID GOD GET A SON? CAN WE NOT SIT? I CAN'T RESPOND TO SUCH A GOOD QUESTION WITHOUT THINKING. THE SCRIPTURES SAY THAT BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE EXISTED THERE WAS CHRIST WITH GOD. PERHAPS JESUS CALLED HIMSELF "SON" BECAUSE HE KNEW IT WOULD HELP US TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS PART OF HIS FATHER, JUST AS WE ARE A PART OF OUR FATHERS HERE ON EARTH. JESUS CHRIST, BY HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION, BECAME THE GOSPEL. MYSTERIOUS SOUNDING. YES? BUT TIMOTHY, I AM A WITNESS TO THAT LIGHT, AND BEYOND HISTORY, AND OUTSIDE THE BIBLE, HE IS AS REAL TO ME AS ANY LIVING PERSON. THAT IS WHY I DON'T ARGUE ABOUT HIM, I ONLY SAY, "SEEK HIM, TRY HIM."

I WOULD LEAD HIM TO THAT PLACE OF REST, BROTHER, BUT I CANNOT MAKE HIM STAY. ONLY GOD CAN DO MORE. DON'T WORRY, SON, OKAY? PERHAPS I MISUNDERSTOOD MY CALLING. O LORD, I KNOW YOU DO NOT FAIL, EVEN IF I AM NOT EFFECTIVE. FORGIVE ME FOR PLACING TOO MUCH VALUE ON MYSELF. TIMOTHY? [Timothy voiceover] THIS CRAZY GUITAR'S IN MY WAY FOR THE LAST TIME. YOU KEEP IT NOW. REMEMBER THE GUY WHO TRIED TO HUSTLE YOU FOR BREAKFAST. TIM DEVON. P.S. THE LETTER IN THE CASE... PLEASE MAIL IT BEFORE YOU LEAVE AMSTERDAM. THANKS. [phone rings] HELLO? [woman] MR.

I'M FAR FROM HELL, BUT I RECOGNIZE YOU, SIR. THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS IS YOUR MASTER. BIG TALK FOR A COOLIE. YOU CANNOT HAVE HIM. THE POLICE WILL FIND YOU IN SOME ALLEY WITH HEROIN SWIMMING IN YOUR VEINS, BOTH OF YOU! RUN! GO ON, GET OUT OF HERE, GO! I DO NOT GO WITHOUT YOU, TIMOTHY! WE MAKE A LITTLE BLOOD TEST. IT IS MY WISH TO LIVE PEACEFULLY WITH ALL MEN. [yelling] [pistol fires] [grunting] WHERE'D THE KARATE COME FROM? I HAVE MUCH TO CONFESS THIS DAY! [Timothy] OKAY, NOW JUST LET ME WALK WHEN WE GET THERE. [Raj] IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE... [shouting excitedly in Punjabi] WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY TO HIM? THE TRUTH, BROTHER. OH, YEAH, "HI, THERE, BY THE WAY, WE'RE RELATED." AREN'T YOU COMING? CALIFORNIA TO HOLLAND, ACCOMPANIED BY INDIA? IT COULD GIVE HIM A HEADACHE. WELL, I HOPE HE'S HAD A GOOD DAY SO FAR. [bell chimes faintly] [speaking Dutch] I'M...AN AMERICAN, SORRY. YES, UHM, WHAT IS IT? I WOULD LIKE TO MEET... SEE...MR. DE BIE. IS THIS FOR AN APPOINTMENT? THE DOCTOR IS QUITE BUSY. ARE YOU SELLING SOMETHING? OH, NO, WE JUST BIKED OUT FROM AMSTERDAM. THE YOUNG MAN BRINGS GREETINGS FROM A FRIEND IN AMERICA. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY THAT. [cow moos] HELLO? IS DR. DE BIE HERE? GOOD MORNING! YOU'LL HAVE TO COME TO ME. I'M RUNNING LATE. DO I KNOW YOU? HAVE WE MET? NOT EXACTLY. PLEASE STATE YOUR BUSINESS. MY SCHEDULE RULES ME TODAY. SIR... JUST WANTED TO BRING YOU THIS. HAS SOMEBODY DECIDED TO SUE ME? I WOULDN'T TAKE YOU FOR A PROSPEROUS LAWYER. BUT THEN, PERHAPS YOU'RE INCOGNITO. BUT WHERE DID YOU FIND SUCH A THING? I WAS PROWLING IN THE FLEA MARKET IN THE CITY, AND THERE IT WAS. IT WAS ONLY TEN GUILDERS, AND SOMEBODY SAID IT WAS YOU. BUT WHY ARE TWO PICTURES CIRCLED? THE YOUNG LADY? JANET CARSON. WAS SHE RECOGNIZED AS WELL? SHE'S MY MOTHER, AND SHE INFORMED ME, SOMEWHAT RELUCTANTLY, THAT I AM YOUR SON. YOU LIVED TOGETHER IN SAN FRANCISCO DURING THE SIXTIES. THAT'S WHERE I CAME IN. [speaking Dutch] WELL, YOU'VE GOT THE PICTURES NOW. I'M TIRED OF CARRYING THEM AROUND. WAIT! WHAT DO I CALL YOU? YOU DON'T! [speaking Dutch] DID YOU EXPECT HIM TO INVITE YOU TO TEA AFTER SUCH NEWS? HOW DO I KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED? OR DID GODTELL YOU THAT, TOO! I THINK IT IS TOO FAST, TIMOTHY. HE NEEDS TIME. [Timothy] YEAH, HE NEEDS TIME! SURE! GREAT! HOW 'BOUT ANOTHER 18 YEARS OF MYLIFE! AFTER ALL, WE'VE ONLY GOT A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING HERE. I'LL GO WITH YOU, WE'LL TALK TO HIM. YOU'RE OUT OF IT NOW! YOU GOT IT, SWAMI? I KNOW YOUR PLAN, MAN. YOU'RE SET ON CLAIMING ME FOR JESUS. YOU WANT MYSCALP HANGING FROM YOUR BELT, SO YOU CAN MAKE POINTS WITH YOUR "GOD SQUAD" BACK AT THE RAI CENTER. YOU JUST FORGET ABOUT ME, MAN!

PRASAD CHECKED OUT OF ROOM THREE-ELEVEN? THREE-ELEVEN? NOT SURE... HAVEN'T GOT HIS DEPARTURE LISTED, BUT THERE HAS BEEN MUCH CONFUSION. SO MANY CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS HAVE LEFT THIS MORNING. [Billy Graham] WHAT IF YOU KNEW CHRIST WOULD RETURN IN ONE MINUTE, AND YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD THAT KNEW IT? [translation] WOULD YOU FALL ON YOUR KNEES AND CRY OUT FOR MERCY AND REALIZE YOU'VE NEVER REALLY KNOWN HIM? SUPPOSE YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE THAT KNEW THAT CHRIST WOULD RETURN IN 30 SECONDS. WOULD YOU RUN OUT INTO THE STREET AND SCREAM AT THE TOP OF YOUR VOICE, "JESUS IS COMING! REPENT AND BELIEVE! "REPENT AND BELIEVE!" SUPPOSE IT WAS TWENTY SECONDS, AND YOU REALIZE THAT YOU'VE NOT LIVED A HOLY LIFE, YOU'RE NOT READY TO SEE CHRIST AND YOU'RE NOW DESPERATE. TEN SECONDS... NINE... EIGHT... SEVEN... FIVE... FOUR... TWO... ONE... AND YOU'RE NOT READY. GOD HAS ENTRUSTED TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME, REDEEMED SINNERS, THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CARRYING OUT HIS DIVINE PURPOSE. HE'S GIVEN US THE PRIVILEGE, THE HIGH AND HOLY PRIVILEGE, TO PROCLAIM HIS MESSAGE OF THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM. LET US THEREFORE ASK GOD TO GIVE US A FRESH VISION OF THE WORLD THAT IS OUTSIDE CHRIST. A WORLD FOR WHICH CHRIST DIED. A WORLD WHICH IS FILLED WITH FEAR, GUILT, CHAOS, AND SPIRITUAL EMPTINESS. HOW MANY OF US HAVE LOVED PEOPLE FOR CHRIST SO MUCH THAT WE'VE SHED TEARS? DO YOU SEE PEOPLE EVERY DAY AND DO YOU LOOK AT THEM AS "LOST PEOPLE"? SEPARATED FROM GOD WITH EMPTY HEARTS, SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. THAT SOMETHING IS GOD. I DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF US ARE HERE BY CHANCE. GOD HAS BROUGHT EACH OF US HERE FOR A PURPOSE, AND MAY EACH OF US GO FROM AMSTERDAM WITH A NEW COMMITMENT TO DO THE WORK OF AN EVANGELIST. THERE'S ONE WORD THAT ALL OF US CAN SAY IN EVERY LANGUAGE. I WANT US TO SAY IT TOGETHER. HALLELUJAH! [audience repeats] HALLELUJAH! [Billy Graham] HALLELUJAH! HALLELUJAH! [Billy Graham] HALLELUJAH! HALLELUJAH! NOW, DO THE WORK OF AN EVANGELIST! [applause] DO THE WORK OF AN EVANGELIST! DO THE WORK OF AN EVANGELIST! NOW UNTO HIM THAT IS ABLE TO KEEP YOU FROM FALLING AND TO PRESENT YOU FAULTLESS BEFORE THE PRESENCE OF HIS GLORY WITH EXCEEDING JOY, TO THE ONLY WISE GOD, OUR SAVIOR, BE GLORY AND MAJESTY AND DOMINION AND POWER, BOTH NOW AND EVERMORE, AMEN! [miscellaneous conversations] AH, GOD KEEP YOU, SON. AND YOU! SUCH STRONG MEAT, OUR DAYS HERE. NEED SIT ALONE TO TAKE IT IN. WE'LL NOT MEET AGAIN 'TIL... YEAH. I PRAY FOR TIMOTHY. ♪ ♪ HI YA, CHIEF. I DIDN'T FIGURE YOU SHOULD TAKE OFF WITHOUT SOME SORT OF GOODBYE. TIMOTHY... THANK YOU. WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SUPPOSE I DECIDED TO, LATER ON, SHIFT TO YOUR SIDE? IT'D BE A HASSLE TO LOOK YOU UP IN INDIA. FROM WHAT I HEAR IT'S A PRETTY BIG PLACE. "SHIFT TO YOUR SIDE?" THIS EXPRESSION IS NOT KNOWN TO ME. UH, WHAT YOU SAID, UH, THAT...I MEAN, THE ONLY SURE WAY IS TO TRY HIM, RIGHT, AND... THAT HE'S AS REAL TO YOU AS ANY LIVING PERSON, AND I DECIDED TO MAKE A TEST FOR MYSELF. I WANT TO SEE IF YOU'RE... YOU KNOW... YOU'RE ASKING TO BE A CHRISTIAN? I'M FEELING MY WAY THROUGH THIS THING, OKAY? I'VE GOT A LOT OF GARBAGE IN MY LIFE, TO DUMP. HE IS LIKE A LOWLY STREET SWEEPER IN MY COUNTRY. HE WILL TAKE IT ALL AWAY. IF WE CONFESS OUR SINS TO HIM, HE CAN BE DEPENDED UPON TO CLEANSE US FROM EVERY WRONG, AND THEN... YOU MUST ASK HIM TO BE LORD OF YOUR LIFE. UH, SEE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. [horn beeps] HE WILL SHOW YOU. RAJ SAYS YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT ME, JESUS. NOT MUCH SENSE IN REPEATING MYSELF. I'VE HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF. I REALLY KNOW THAT. I'M SORRY. PLEASE MAKE IT RIGHT. I WANT TO BELIEVE IN YOU. I GUESS I'M OPENING THE DOOR. [Raj] MY HEART IS SINGING. I CAN BARELY HOLD IT IN PLACE. HERE! JUST HERE! THANKS GOD. HE'S INSIDE WAITING FOR US, I HOPE. UH-HUH. WELL, TIMOTHY IS TIMOTHY. WELL, THANK YOU FOR COMING. MOM, WE GO THROUGH CUSTOMS IN NEW YORK. WELL, LOOK, HE REALLY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. HE'S WAITING, OKAY? OKAY, JUST A MINUTE. YEAH, YOU, TOO. MOM... SHE REALLY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. YOU STILL LIKE ICE CREAM FOR BREAKFAST? OF COURSE I REMEMBER. YES, IT'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS BUT... [Raj] TIMOTHY! I TOLD YOU HE WAS HERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOUR GUITAR, TIMOTHY. YOU LEFT IT AT THE HOTEL. I TOLD THEM IT WAS YOURS. HE'S A MUSICIAN, MOST PROFESSIONAL. IT'S YOURS, RAJ. I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT. YOU DO? THEY SUSPECT I AM A SMUGGLER. YOU ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE IT. THERE'S BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING. I GAVE IT TO HIM. DO YOU WANT TO LOOK INSIDE AGAIN? [man] WE MUST GO! WE'D BETTER FINISH THIS OFF. IF YOU THINK I HAVE DIFFICULTIES HERE, WAIT 'TIL THEY SEE MY BEAUTIFUL GUITAR IN NEW DELHI. I HAVE 13 HOURS TO WORK UP A GOOD STORY. [chuckling] WISH I COULD BE THERE TO HEAR IT, MAN. THANKS, RAJ, FOR BEING MY FRIEND, MAN. LET'S GO! LOOK, I'D LIKE TO WRITE YOU. DO! OKAY. PERHAPS WE SHOULD TRY AGAIN, NEXT SUMMER, HUH? YEAH!
