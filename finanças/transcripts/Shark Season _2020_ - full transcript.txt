- Hey, Dad. - Yeah, hey! I'm sorry to bother you. I know you're busy all the time. Oh, I mean, it's not a bother. Listen, I was packin' up all that stuff and I packed up all Mom's stuff in the boxes and, uh... All the painting stuff went with it, you know. Do you want it? I don't paint, Dad. You really should paint, you know. You got plenty of talent. I can't. It just... It reminds me of her, okay? I mean, I understand that. But if you ever do wanna paint, you let me know because I think she'd like you to have her stuff. I'll think about it. What is it you're doing now, anyway? I'm about to go paddle out and shoot some. Who's going out there with you, anyway? Jason. Just you and Jason, huh? Actually, there's a makeup artist with us. Her name's Meghan. Jason said they're pretty good friends. Okay, nice and professional, eh? Where exactly are you gonna go to take these photos? Just that same little spot. All right. Well, you gotta make sure you're checkin' the weather, right? Yeah, it's good. I mean, we've been there hundreds of times, so... Listen, I know you're a water baby, but, you know, it is the ocean. Let's face it. It's a bay, Dad, and if the weather gets bad, then we'll just turn around and come back. It'll be fine, all right? But I gotta go. We're about to load up. All right. Well, be careful. Thanks. Listen, have fun, okay? Please remember I love you and I miss you. Love you, too. Oh, this reminds me when I was 12. You ate this when you were 12? You didn't? No. I had Slim Jims. Tried to find Slim Jims. This is all they had. You know what's in Slim Jims, right? No, not really. Have you ever heard of Soylent Green? Yeah. Like the drink. You're losing points here! The 1973 classic with Charlton Heston. Soylent Green is people! People? Okay. That's why it tastes so good. You're gross. You're grosser. Ugh. Sarah! Meet Meghan. Meghan, meet Sarah. Thanks for the introduction. We actually met once before. Our last photo exhibit, you said something like our photos look like paintings. Oh, yeah! Painting with light! Wow, you have a great memory. Wouldn't forget it. Great. I didn't know you guys had met before. There was a lot of people at that show. Well, Meghan showed me her portfolio. And her makeup work is awesome. Yeah. I actually checked it out online. Nice work. Great. All right. We're all awesome then. Yeah! Hey, listen, guys, I know we planned on going back to that island just past Cudjoe Basin. But I wanted to pitch another option. You know that hurricane that tore through the Keys last month? Well, it rearranged all the channels leading into Florida Bay. I've been speaking to some fishing buddies. They told me that a submerged rock formation is now above water in the channel, in the outer banks. I promise you the shots will be sick. We'd be the first to capture it. They say it looks like the Bahamas. It's just a little further out. But if we leave now, we can be there and back by nightfall. How much further out? Well, it's just past Cuba, so I guess that should be... Shut up! No. I mean, where we're headed, I would say maybe another hour beyond that. So three hours? Yeah. How do you know if it's still above water? Well, my buddies were there two days ago. It's mostly underwater, but with these peak tides we're having, should be high and dry for at least two or three hours during low tide. Wouldn't it be awesome to be the first to capture an entirely new island? I'm in. Yeah? Good. Me too. Great! Great! Okay! Hey! Phone! Want it in the dry bag? I'm probably just gonna hang on to it, but thank you. Well, these are the things that cannot get wet. I thought you said your makeup was waterproof. Well, it is, but my kit's not. Okay. All right, guys, let's hit the water. We gotta make our window. Let's go. Ladies... I call blue! Oh, you got the pretty one. I got you. Nice, all right. Take your time. Good? Nice. Balance. Okay. We're good to go! All right, ladies. Tide cycles are at peak highs and peak lows. We gotta get in, get what we need, get out, before it goes back underwater. Fortunately, with a photographer like myself and a stellar makeup artist like you, a couple of hours will be more than enough. Forgetting someone? Oh, yeah, our subject. Yeah, yeah. She's all right, but you know, with all that natural beauty in the environment, the model doesn't matter much. You're gonna shoot me in silhouette, right? Silhouette? Yeah. Actually, the whole thing's not gonna even be in focus. That sounds about right. Ouch! Guess you don't need a makeup artist anyway. Oh, no, no. We definitely need you. Even in silhouette, she's gonna need as much makeup as possible. Okay... Okay, okay, all right! All right! Enough fun. Jeez, we gotta get there! Keep paddling, ladies, keep paddling. Beep, beep. Hey, Sarah. I saw you on your phone earlier. - Was that your dad? - Yeah. How's he doin'? Okay, I guess. Definitely not used to being alone. Yeah. Yeah, I get it. My mom passed away about a year ago. But we knew it was coming, so we were prepared. I mean, as well as anyone can be. I'm so sorry. Thanks. It's not easy. She was... She was one of a kind, just like her daughter. An artist, right? Her dad is a bush pilot, flew all over the world, was delivering medicine in Botswana. He was in the Air Force. Not the Air Force. What was it then? Civil Air Patrol. Yeah, that's part of the Air Force. No, it's different. They're volunteers. Right, volunteer. So he's a super hero. Did he ask about me? Actually, he did. Yes! See? Super hero. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Those are dolphins! Check it out. Wow! I've never been this close to dolphins before. Whoa! Dude, look at that! That dolphin is really beat up. What do you think did that? Maybe a boat? No, no, no. These are bottlenose. I mean, they're the bad boys of the ocean. Who knows who they're hustling with. It looks like bite marks. Yeah. We're making good time, ladies. Let's take five. Please... How much further, you think? Say around two hours. See, this is the time I think I would have loved to pitch in to a motorboat. Okay, planet killer, right? Look, I mean, this can be pretty dodgy around here, especially if you don't know the area. I mean, you got reefs, oysters bars. You gotta be careful. Yeah. Honestly, even the Coast Guard takes it easy in the back water. Didn't you say you were a monster with a paddle? Yeah... not this kind of paddle. Okay. What? Live a little. So this is our usual spot, but the rock formation we're gonna be shooting at today is just a little bit further south towards the reef. Gonna be worth that extra mile. Um, will you put this in your dry bag, please? Certainly. Glad to see you've come around. Behave. What? All right, guys. Almost there. And here we are! Look at this place! Doesn't this look great? I don't know. Looks like a cement block with barnacles. We're not goin' for pretty. We're going for unique. The shots are gonna be awesome. Woo! Whoa. Wow. All right! What do we think? Wow! It's definitely not the Bahamas, but I feel we can probably make it work. Okay? Right. That's what we wanna hear! All right, let's get this show on the road! Yeah. Let me get the camera. You guys do makeup. - Will you get my wrap? - Yeah. Sit right there? Yeah, perfect. Okay. What are you thinking? I'm thinking let's keep with the natural look. - I like it. - Okay. You have a natural beauty about you. Thank you. - Yeah, you, too. - Thank you! - Yeah. - Okay, let's see. Do you want to fry it or do you wanna... I like it a little wet. Perfect! What do you think? Yeah, it's nice. Damn, a beautiful mermaid! I'm serious! And then with the wrap on your waist, it'll be perfect. Yeah, I dig it. All right, let's do some shoots. All right, nice! Yeah, that's it. Get that light. Nice, let's do it. Can you turn a little bit that way? Yeah, that's it. Ha-ha. All right, hold on a sec! I wasn't expecting you to invite me out here. Well, why not? You're awesome. Thank you. I know, it's just the whole... Sarah thing. No, look. Sarah and I are friends, good friends. Yeah, yeah, I can see that. It's not like that. I just don't want to get in between anything... There's nothing there, not anymore. Look, Sarah and I, we were together for a while. And it was special, but it's not special in the way you think. I care about Sarah and her family means the world to me. I admire her... and her dad. I was with them when her mom had her illness. You know, it almost broke their family. I'm really happy that you came, okay? Yeah, I'm so happy to be here. I just want... I just want to make sure you can do what you want and you're cool with it. You know what I wanna do? I would love for us three to make some really cool art together. Me, too. I actually have that same one at home. No kidding? Right? Check this one out. The lighting is so dope! You wanna get down a little bit? Yeah, yeah, that's it. I'll grab the GoPro. Do you mind holding this? - I don't mind at all. - Thank you. Okay. You're right, yeah. That's gonna be good! Looking good! She's nice. Meghan? Yeah, she's cool. I, uh, I don't know much about her makeup credentials. But I can definitely see why you'd want to bring her along. You guys seem like you're getting along real well. Yeah, she's cool. We hung out after the last gallery. You left early. Yeah, I honestly think she'd be a really good pick for you. We're, uh, we're doin' matchmaker now? That's an interesting switch. No, I'm not playing matchmaker. I'm just making an observation. An observation, okay. Well, what do you see now? What do you observe? I observe that we should probably just keep shooting. Sarah? What? All I'm saying is that... if you ever did decide to move on, I would be happy for you. Yeah. All right. Are we good? Yeah, yeah, we're good. - Underwater shots? - Yeah, sure. Go for it. Me first? Woo! All right, I got you! Ready? - Woo! - Woo! Jason. Go back up, all right? Okay, wait 'til I get low and swim down to me, yeah? Oh, my God. Shark! Sarah! Jason! Get out of the water! There's a shark! There's a shark! - Jason! - Sarah, get to shore! Ah! Jason! Jason! Jason! What are we gonna do? It's right there! I don't know! What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? I've never been through this! My phone, my phone, my phone, my phone. My phone's in here. Just, uh... My phone's dead. My phone's dead! Just get your phone! Is it working? No signal! Go find a signal and call 911, please. Just call 911. I'm not calling 911. I'm calling my dad. No, no, no, no! Please just call 911! My battery is almost dead, all right? I only have time to make one call. Why would your dad be the one to call? He will figure it out! If there's anybody that can do this, it's him! But my battery is dying and I still don't have a signal, okay? Your dad doesn't know we're here! We changed our plans, remember? He will figure it out, okay? I need you to trust me! You're supposed to call 911. You're not supposed to call your daddy. Okay, we call 911, 911 calls the Coast Guard. They call the Navy and they call Civil Air Patrol! Either way, it ends up on his desk for Search and Rescue! So I need you to trust me. Because I just got a signal and I'm calling my dad! Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, God. Yes, hello? Dad, dad, dad, listen! It's me! Dad, I don't have a lot of time, but we're stranded where we're on this rock formation. And we didn't go to the island that we normally go to. We're like an hour off of Cudjoe Key! Dad, Jason died. It was a shark. Wait a second! Jason's dead? Yes! This thing is circling and the tide's coming in. We're not safe here. Are you okay? We're here! We're on land! Dad, the tide's rising a lot faster than I thought! I think we have like 45 minutes. I have that long and this phone's gonna die! I just need you to tell me that you're gonna find us! Honey, listen. You're doin' good. I'll get on with Civil Air Patrol. Telephone Forensics Team can get a bead on your location. Stay where you are as long as you can. Yeah, we'll stay here, but, Dad, the water's rising. The tide's coming in so much faster than we thought. Okay, and are there any other islands around? Is there anyplace else you can go? Yes! I saw one on the way in here. I don't know where it is, but I can find it. Listen, just stay there as long as you can. It's coming... It's coming back! The shark! What was that? Are you okay? We're fine, we're fine! Just please promise me you'll find us, okay? Honey! Honey! Dad! It's something. Listen, yes, I've tried. I tried to get her back, but it goes straight to voicemail. Do you have enough data to pinpoint her location? Cellphone forensics is analyzing the pings from their phones provided by the cellphone carrier. As you were saying, it appears the phones are off now. With the limited data we do have, I can't get exact GPS coordinates. But by tracking the direction of the pings when the phones were on, it appears you're right from what you were saying. It seems to be they're traveling towards the outer islands of the Florida Bay, the Cudjoe Basin. Right. So it looks like they were heading to those outer islands that I was telling you about. All the initial pings line up heading to those islands, except the last one which was a little off, which could be an anomaly. With only one local tower, it's hard to get an exact GPS location. How confident are you of the accuracy of the cellphone data? Unfortunately, the cellphone forensics team won't be able to pinpoint their exact location. With only one local tower in that area, it's more of a wilderness area. If there were three local towers, we would be able to triangulate their location. We are basing it on what we have and what you told us about their destination. Okay, got it. The other issue is because of the single tower, reception becomes an issue. There's no full coverage in that basin. If they venture in an area without reception, even our limited tracking is impossible. What is the ETA on getting a decision on who's available? I'll have an answer by 0300 hours. It's got to be faster than that! That area is affected by tidal flow. I hear what you're saying. We'll have an answer pronto. And I will get eyes in the sky as soon as possible. Okay. Then I'll call her back soon. Now let me know if the cellphone forensics team can get a better idea on their location, okay? Thanks. We'll do our best to find her, James. I'll be in touch. Hey, it's Sarah. Leave me a message and I'll call you back. Honey, I guess you're phone is off. I got you through Civil Air Patrol. We're working on trying to get a lock on your location. It won't be exact, but close enough to narrow down the search. They're gonna send up a spotter plane within one hour. I hope you're all right. Don't worry. Help is on the way. So call me. I love you. Tides are coming in fast again. I noticed. What are we gonna do? Look for higher ground. I'm not getting back in that water. I'm not. I'm not doing it. Look, where we stand, will soon be underwater and we won't have a choice. Maybe we just stay here, someone will find us! And we won't have to get back in the water with the shark. That'd be great, but we can't argue with the reality of the situation we're in right now, which is that this island is going under fast. So we do need to act and we need to act now. Sarah, the kayaks! Shit! What? - Come on! - Oh, come on! It's right there, it's right there, it's right there! Meghan, put your paddle in the water and let's go! Okay, okay, okay! Come on, Meg. I need you to keep the pace up! Where do we go? Where do we go? Right there. Dry land, it's right there. Meghan, are you with me? Oh, God. It's back - It's back. - Where? It's right there. Let's go! What is that? Oh my God, it's sharks. It's sharks, it's sharks, it's sharks! Come on! Come on! Move! Dolphins. Come on! This is our window! Let's go! Okay! Meghan, let's go! Where do we go? Where do we go? Where do we go? Right in front of us! I don't know! Meghan, don't stop! It's coming this way. Come on. You got this. Keep up with me, Meg! That's the land right there. We can make it. I gotta take a break, I gotta take a break. We gotta keep goin'! Please, I just need a minute. Sarah, please, just one minute. I didn't sign up for this survival B.S. Neither did I. Why couldn't he have done this shoot on like a beach with big palm trees? You know, originally, we talked about doing this in a pool. Are you kidding me? What happened? You know Jason. He always had to push the limit. Well, after this, I am no longer pushing my limits. I'm only working on dry land and preferably close to a place where I can get a drink. Sure I can't interest you in a three-week editorial shoot through polar bear country? That was next up on our to-do list. Hey, do you mind handing me that knife? I'll cut both of our wrists. Okay. You ready to get to moving? Yeah. That's it, Meg. Sarah... Sarah? It's a shark! It's a shark! It's a shark! It's a dolphin. What? Are you sure? Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no, no, that's a shark. That's a shark! Shark! Paddle! Oh, no, oh, no! Sarah, wait! What? Listen to me, please! What? Sharks are attracted to vibrations, right? Maybe they're attracted to our paddling. So maybe if we stand still, they won't find us. Dude, we can make it. You know what? I'm not going to make it! I'll stay with you. Okay, I'll stay with you. Okay, hold there. If we tie our kayaks together, we can make one shape in the water. It'll make us look bigger, not like something that that thing can eat, okay? I'm gonna hold on to this. Catch this. This will hopefully buy us enough time to rest and then we can just make it to that island. Okay, pull your paddle in. Where is it? Shh! Be quiet. Sarah? Sarah? We're fine. Did you see its eyes roll back? What does that mean? When it bites into something it can't see. Is it still right here? I don't know. Hey, are you girls okay? Get out! Get out! Meghan! Meghan! Do you need any help? Come on, come on! We gotta get over there. He's dead, Sarah. Sarah, stop. Sarah, stop! He's dead! Sarah, listen to me! The man's dead! We can get over there. The man's dead! We can reach that! We can get... Sarah, you're not thinking! The lanyard fell down with him! It's a Sea-Doo, okay? So even if we got to the jet ski, the lanyard still fell down with the rider! So it's not going to start! Do you got it? Come on, we gotta go! Come on. - Please, just help me! - Okay! Okay. Sarah! Look! Look! There's a sandbar! We can make it! Come on! What do you want? Sarah, this is me calling in to check with you! I hope you're hangin' in tight. Air Patrol has a decent lock on your position there. It's a ballpark estimate because they don't have enough cell towers out there to triangulate your location. But once they get in the air, they should be able to pick you out. We're checkin' on the outer islands, okay? So call me back. Call me back, honey, call me back. Hey, it's Sarah. Leave me a message and I'll call you back. Sarah, honey, listen. I hope you're safe. I wanted to let you know that the helicopter is up in the air. Marine Patrol is synching with the Coast Guard. All hands are on deck to get you home. I wanted to give you some good news. Right now, where you're at is experiencing what they call the king tides. It's a phenomenon having to do with the moon being in its pedigree. The part of Florida where you're at can get to real bad. It's a full moon tonight and When the tide comes in, there's a chance there won't be any dry land left in the entire basin. It'll flood all the little islands until the Keys on the outer edge of the Florida Bay. Do whatever you can to find the highest ground and wait it out. I've always said that I would go through hell and high water to keep you safe. Now I know you've been through hell and now you're gonna have to go through high water, okay? Hang in there, honey. Hang in there because help is on the way, okay? Your dad loves you. I'm sorry. I know. I knew. Jason never stopped loving you. I didn't even want to come on this gig. I didn't want to come on this gig because I knew he was still in love with you. And I know you guys broke up! And I wouldn't have been with him if you guys were still together! You may not have loved him, but I did. And now he's gone. This is not what I wanted! Goddamn it! This is not what I planned! I wanted a white picket fence! I wanted... I wanted a dog! I wanted... Jason. You had everything and you threw it all away. I think you should know... this is not what I planned for my life either! I'm not going down by shark. Yeah. How you wanna go down then? I don't know, but I'll tell you one thing. This? Right here, all of this? This is not it! And I don't wanna be laying down in some hospital bed tied up to machines with tubes coming out of every hole in my body, just dwindling while my family watches! I don't want to be sitting there trying to find something to say to make it all better. I wanna be 100 years old and surrounded by grandchildren. And I wanna be drinking the best mug of tea you've ever had in your entire life. That's how I'm gonna go out. You wanna die by tea? Yeah. I think dying by tea sounds really nice right about now. I thought tea extended your life. No. Talking about sweet tea. Oh, with sugar. And lemon. Lemon's good for you. Sugar? I don't approve. It's bad. It's bad for you. You have a problem with sugar? Yeah, I have a problem with sugar. Oh, my God. Yeah, I don't know if we can be friends after this. Me either. Was that your mom... who you were talking about? Is that how she... Cancer. By the time they caught it, there wasn't much we could do except... sit and watch. That's... After that is when Jason and I decided to split. I need you to know that I did love him. I did. But I wasn't in love with him. And watching my mom, it just made me re-evaluate everything. It made me realize that that wasn't fair to him. It wasn't fair to keep him in that when I knew that there was someone that could love him better. Someone like you. That's why when I saw him today, with you, and he was smiling and he was laughing like a real Jason laugh. I was happy for him. I was. I was happy for him. That is what he deserves. It's what he deserved. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sarah! Sarah! Sarah, Sarah! - Hey! - Hey, hey! Hey, over here! Hey, hey! - We're right here! - We're over here! - Right here! - Over here! Hey! Come on! Get the kayak. Ready, left to right, left to right, tilt it. - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! Okay, just... just... Get your phone! Get your phone and see if you got any service! I put a solar charger in the dry bag! Full bars, but the charger's not working! - Let me do it. - What the heck? I got it, I got it! There's water in it. Yeah, it hasn't been charging. Meghan, we probably just need to lay it out. - Just set it down. - I'm trying to get it in. It hasn't been charging. It's dead. Just let it go! Work! It's not gonna work. Let it go, just... It's connected. There, go, put it in. Oh my God. You fixed it. How'd you do it? Whoever said watching random YouTube videos was stupid is wrong. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah? Whoa, we were just there a minute ago and now it's underwater! What are we gonna do if this whole thing goes underwater? We still have the kayaks. I'm not getting back into that water! I think you were on to something with the movement thing. We can just minimize our movement and stick to the shallow areas. That thing is right next to shore! I know that, but you're not helping, okay? Right now, I need you to look at the bright side! Yeah? And what is that? We're not dead yet! Oh, right, yeah. We're not dead yet. We're just stranded on an island. A shark's trying to hunt us, the sea plane can't find us. And now the island is flooding! What next? The shark's just gonna turn into a tornado? I can't do this anymore, Sarah! Um... Yeah, hello? Sarah? Dad, dad! Yeah, it's me. How are you doing? Yes, we're fine, but I just saw a chopper. It was a single-engine chopper. I think it was them. Well, that was it! That's great! Can you give me more information about the fly-by? That'll help me figure out where exactly you are! They flew right over us. They flew right over us to the east and way north, Dad, way north! Well, that's helpful. They've been searching on the other islands and they're expanding from there. No, no, no! We didn't go to Cudjoe Key, Dad! No, we're on this new island. Jason said it just formed in the hurricane. It just formed like a month ago. And I don't even think it's on their maps. You must be south, southwest of the search area. I'll have them modify their search grid. If you can keep your phone on, we might be able to get a better lock on your new location. I don't think we have much time. We may not be able to stay here long. The water's rising. Okay, then stay calm, stay calm. Dad... Your area is experiencing a peak of what they call king tides. You know about king tides? Yes, I know about king tides. They're higher than normal. That's right. Much higher. Unfortunately, that area you're in can be particularly hard hit. It's the equivalent of experiencing a storm surge, but it's with the tide alone. It's not based on weather, but the phase of the moon. The stats tell me all the islands out there may be overwhelmed. Hello? You still there? Yes. You still have your kayaks? Yes, we have the kayaks, Dad, but... Listen. I know this is gonna be difficult and I wish I could be there with you. But you and Meghan have done great so far. You keep up what you've been doing. It's been keeping you both alive. Dad, be honest with me: if they don't find us by sundown, are you guys gonna suspend the search? We will find you, honey. We will find you! I know. I know that you won't give up, Dad. But if the tides are as powerful as you say, and... and if you guys have to suspend the search, I just want you to know that we tried. The spotter helicopter will find you! I just want you to know that I love you and I went out fighting. Stay on the line. I'm not gonna let you down. I've never done that before, have I? Okay, okay. - Dad! - Sarah! Sarah, hello! Dad! Civic Air Patrol, Darren speaking. Hello, it's James Murray. I'm just off the phone with my daughter. We have a new data set for cellphone forensics. I had her on the line for approximately three minutes. We need to expand the search from our initial grid. I have new information on her location. Our initial search area, I believe, was incorrect. They traveled to a new location, another island. With the king tides, the water is rising fast. Stand by. I'll get right back to you. Copy that. I'll get back to you soon. This island's flooded. We gotta go. We got this. I talked to Fish and Wildlife and the NOAA Fisheries Southeast Marine Mammal Stranding Network coordinator. You're not going to believe this! Apparently a pod of pilot whales stranded and died on the outer shoals of Cudjoe Basin approximately two weeks ago. They tell me it was a about thirty whales. It may have had something to do with the hurricane. No-one knows. They were stranded and died in the shallow water. Standard operating procedure when something like that happens out there in such a remote area is to leave the carcasses to decay and return to nature, which NOAA confirmed they did. So there are whale carcasses in the water down there? There were whales carcasses. It gets complicated. Apparently NOAA began receiving reports from boaters and fishermen of a massive great white shark feeding on the whales' remains. It was reported to be a six-meter shark. Great whites are seasonal visitors to the Keys. It is unusual for something like this to show up in that area on the back side of the keys. Well, sure, but if there's something drawing it in like a pod of dead whales... Right, So after reports of the large shark feeding in the area, NOAA decided to remove the carcasses from the water in hopes that the shark would leave. And that didn't happen? Well, they did remove the carcasses, but the shark didn't leave. Does this explain the shark's behavior? I put in a call to the Mote Marine Laboratory. They have a few theories on what is going on with the shark. Sharks are opportunistic feeders and finding something like a whale is a rare opportunity. When they find a large source of food such as those whale carcasses, the shark's appetite expands to take advantage of the bounty. So basically the appetite increases relative to the availability of food. Encountering a dead whale for a shark is a rare opportunity. And the expansion of appetite is a natural way for the shark to take advantage of an abundant food supply while it lasts. It turbo charges their appetites. This allows the shark to go from feast to famine and survive periods when it cannot find food, kind of like a lion at a kill. When it has to, it can eat many times more food than normal. And this keeps it going through lean times. So the presence of the whale carcass increases the shark's appetite. And when they removed the whales, instead of driving the shark away, they left the shark with super-sized appetite looking for prey. That's one of the theories, and it makes sense to me. The biologists also surmise that the shark may have become more aggressive in a territorial manner. It may have had to drive off other predators from the whale carcasses. If it's going after the kayaks, it could be defending it's territory. The last theory is what they call a rogue shark. This is a shark that, for whatever reason, goes on a spree of attacks. There is historical precedence for this, a few instances where a single shark made multiple attacks. It's rare. but it happens. Well, it sounds like it could be a combination of both. We gotta find them and get them off the water. And then make sure we're searching for the right area. I know there are a lot of islands out there. But based on their original position, I think we've been searching the wrong area. I know what the forensics have been saying. But Sarah told me they paddled out to a brand new sandbar. Listen, these sandbars change. New ones form and old ones disappear. I don 't think that they were at any of the ones that we have on our maps. Copy that. Right now, we're pushing the limit on our flying time out here. We can do a redirect depending on where you tell me. That would involve a refueling. If that were to happen, we'd have to go back to the airstrip to refuel, which would not allow us enough daylight to finish our search. Are they still out over the Cudjoe Basin? I mean, I think they can manage this without refueling. Copy that. It's your decision. But you do know if we run out of fuel, that'll be the end of the search for today. All right, I got you. Listen. Now they said they saw your helicopter. You can't be too far off. Copy. What is your redirect? I want you to change the search grid, okay? We need to look on the same line, but further south. If you only have fuel enough to search one more place, then this would be it. If this information's incorrect, it's on you. Sir, this is my daughter out there! If this is a rogue shark attack like you say, we don't have time to waste! So please change your search grid to the coordinates that follow. I see it! I see it, it's coming back! It's coming back this way! Where? Sarah, it's right there! It's right there! It's right there! What do we do? What do we do? Shh. Hold position. Stay calm! Meghan, I need you to stay calm. Over here! Hold on, I'm gonna try and flag him down. Come on! We have visual on the kayakers. We have visual! Yeah, let me get a little bit closer. Hey! Oh, there's a massive shark circling the kayakers. Let me get a picture. All right, picture sent. We need to send a boat. I can't get to the swimmers. Running low on fuel. Headed back to base to refuel. No, no, no, no, no, no! Yeah, hello? I just got your message! Can't you land in there and just pick them up? That's a negative. There's too many submerged reefs where they're at. How much is the draft on that helicopter? It's not the draft of the chopper, it's the water clarity. Right now, the visual is not clear enough for our pilot to choose a safe patch for landing. We're directing a boat to them now. How long is it gonna take? It should be under 10 minutes. Can you guys in the helicopter keep an eye on the shark? That's a negative. The spotter chopper has to refuel and return to base. Oh, come on! I'm sorry. If that chopper doesn't return to base now to refuel, it may not make it back. Let me know the minute that the boat reaches them. They're gonna come back, Meghan. They're not gonna leave us here! How do we know they're gonna come back? Stay calm. They're going to come back. Trust me! Where's it going? Where's it going? Where's it going? Where the hell did it go? Oh! There's a boat! There's a boat! Where? Hey! Come on! Head over here! - That's them! - Hey! - Hey! Over here! There's a reef there! It's too shallow! Come to us! Paddle, paddle! Come on. Let's go! Hey! Hey, come to us! Please! No! You have to come to us! Come on! Please meet us! Meghan! Here. Meghan! Grab my paddle! Grab my hand! I got you! I got you! Come on! Come on! Come on! Hurry! Where is it? Do you see it? I don't see it! I don't see it, Sarah! That way. Go that way! That way! I lost the knife! Come on! Come on! Hurry up! Go! Go, Meghan! Go, Meghan, go! Sarah Murray! Got your father on the phone. Sarah, Sarah, are you there? I'm here, Daddy. All right. Thank God, thank God. Are you hurt? Are you okay? I'm... We're okay, we're okay. All right, good. Listen, now paramedics are gonna be meeting you at the docks, okay? I know you're a tough cookie, but they're gonna have to check you over. I'm catching the red eye over tonight. I'll be seeing you as soon as I get there. Okay. Listen, you did good, honey, just like I knew you would. Your mom would be proud of you. Dad? Yeah? When I get back, I wanna talk about Mom's studio. Okay, honey, okay. I don't know. Maybe I could pick up the brush again. I think that could be good. We'll go with whatever you want. It's all right with me, whatever you want. You just let me know. I love you, honey. I love you, too, Dad. I love you, too. Can you still hear me? Yes. All right, honey. Listen, I love you. I love you very, very much, more than you'll ever know. Okay, I'm glad you're okay. Goodbye. Hey, Sarah? If you ever ask me to do your makeup again, I'm gonna have to say no. And it's nothing personal. Like you're... you're great. It's just I can never, ever do this again. Yeah, me neither. You really like painting? I think New Mexico would be a great place for you. Georgia O'Keefe used to live there. And, um, she would sit there and she would just paint. And I think the moment you'd get there, you'd never ever want to leave. And you know the best part about New Mexico? No. No water! No ocean! No lakes! It's just dry. Sounds pretty good. I'm in. I am totally in.
