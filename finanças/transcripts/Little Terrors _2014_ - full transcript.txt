[eerie ambience] [music playing] [shouting] [foreign language] [gunshot] [music playing] Smack it with the tip of your finger instead of your nail. [quiet crying] Samih. Samih, I'm Tarek. I have come to offer my condolence for your brother's martyrdom. His gift has brought him riches that only heaven knows, and his name will be among those regarded. When our word is the one and the whole world follows. [music playing] He's your responsibility now, Samih. [SHOUTING COMMANDS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [music playing] [speaking in foreign language] Your name? Samih. Mukhtar. Is your family dead? There was a wedding party for my sister. The men were shooting bullets into the air in celebrations. The Americans thought they were being fired on and hit us. Your sister? Gone. [snoring] One of the men says he was hit by a shrapnel. Crazy guy. His family had no use for him. Your brother would have been so proud. This is what your father brought you back from America for. A true Muslim. Your brother is a hero. They called him a coward. They twist things around. They call us terrorists, and they drop bombs on innocents. Your brother died a hero. He stood there, proud, praised Allah, and martyred himself. That's not what they said. Samih, the only way to hurt your enemy is to make them appear weak. It is a tactic of the desperate. And they are desperate now because they know there is an army stronger than they are. Army of Allah. And you are now part of that army. Consider me your older brother. That's why I'm telling you to sleep. And you'll see-- tomorrow will be a new beginning. [music playing] Hey, Samih. Isn't this how your mother keeps you fed? Samih. It is of our obedience to Allah. That has kept us from falling under the guise of the infidels. And prayer keeps us centered and focused, that we do not stray. This is the only reason they will never break us. Allah will answer our prayers. [music playing] [foreign speech] To Allah we truly belong and to Allah we return. Do you see what they have done to your brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers? Do you understand now why we fight? They do this and tell us it is for our own good. From far off in the sky, the Zionists fire weapons only they possess. They tell their sons that they are brave. What bravery is there in being our of range? Bravery comes from looking your enemy in the eye, as close as we are now. We must bring the fight to them. Otherwise, they will keep with these cowardly offense. We must take their oppression off our brothers and sisters and turn it on them! Right their wrong. You are the chosen people, not them. Allah teaches us that every child is born perfect because it is born to the perfect faith. Islam. But its parents convert it, divert it, make it imperfect. Your elders won't tell you this, but children are stronger than we are. In the midst of your parents over-protection, did you not become more bored? In their sorrows, did you not become more resolute? More sure of yourself? They won't tell you this, but you have become the leader and not the follower. You have become the protector-- the protectors of all of true Islam. The very thing the oppressors fear most is sitting before me right now-- the children of Islam. And with you, we will do to them what they have done to us. You are the future! And the future offered to the martyr is the greatest one of all. [foreign speech] [music playing] Samih. It's come for you. It's old, but still it's good. A few pieces missing, but I have ordered some new ones. Thank you. You've done very well. Saba Khan is so pleased and has requested you to see him. He wants to see me? Yes. [playing board game] Samih, it's time. Hey, Samih. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You want to really impress Saba Khan? OK. Then after saying salaam, just say... [whispering] He will be pleased. Trust me. OK? Go. [laughter] Come, Samih. Do you know why you have been brought here? Your father, in his wisdom, returning you back in his homeland, gave our cause not only one freedom fighter but two. His passing so soon was a loss. He must be beaming proudly from paradise looking at his son. Your brother too, of course. Thank you. You don't have to thank me for the truth. It is what we adults owe to our children. It is what we have to relearn from the children as we get older. Would you like me to do something? You can do a lot where your brethren are concerned. The Zionists and Americans need to learn the truth. And who better than one of their own to teach them? Will you work hard for a mission I give you? Yes. Good. Hmm. Oh, Samih. Where did you get that remarkable greeting? [screaming] [foreign speech] Why did you tell me to say that? Shut up! Shut up. Shouldn't you be washing Saba Khan's feet, American? Huh? Get up. Stop. Hey. [foreign speech] Get up. I don't want to fight you. Come on. Come on. Stop. Bloody Americans. Go, Rashid. Rashid, you can't do that. You have to flick it. Samih. Go and find Mukhtar. We have to go. Yushua, Rashid-- [music playing] We have to go. Tarek is calling us. I'm coming, American. Hey, guys. I need to grab something cold. -You want something? -No. Hey, hurry. We've got to get back. I've got to Skype my girl. That sounds dirty. Yeah. She likes it when I Skype her all night long. Nice. Do you have any Coke? Hey. Coke. Tssht. [horn honking] Samih. What is it? The complete set of pieces, professional weight and size. Wow. Thank you. We keep our promises. Right? Hey. No Coke. Yeah, I already heard that. Who-- who are your friends? Fuck it. What? Fuck it. Uh, I think you mean fuck off. Fuck it. Hey, guys. Can we take a ride out west? SOLDIER: This time of night? Yeah, I think I heard something. Uh, are there reports of Muslim-Americans bringing their families out to this area? Muslims do stupid things. That's why we're here. That's not what I mean. Remember the bombing in Hyderabad last year? There were rumors the kid was an American. Look, man, we got to get back. You can't see shit in the dark this time of night. We'll talk about it on the way. SOLDIER: I don't know about you guys, but I could sure use a blow job. SOLDIER: Yeah, the only way you're getting your dick sucked out here is if it gets bit by a cobra and Taylor here decides to suck the venom out. They went in this direction. What-- what's up ahead? Uh, there's just a couple warlords up in those hills. Other than that, it's just a bunch of dirt, some abandoned houses, maybe a couple cockroaches. Cockroaches? Sand niggers. Trying to be politically correct here. Call them cockroaches because they can survive anything. Sounds more like a compliment than a put-down. Yeah, it's not meant to be. Cockroaches are still bugs. And you know what we do with bugs? Squash 'em. You know what I don't get? They keep promising these bombers 72 virgins to blow themselves up. It's actually a misnomer. It isn't virgins. It's wives. Yeah, that's even worse. Imagine the alimony. My point is, 72 virgins, wives, whatever-- that equals 72 kids to look over potentially. Wouldn't one of these bombers actually think through the consequences? Or at least get a vasectomy before blowing themselves up to smithereens? Seriously, guys, how are you going to support all those brats on a suicide bomber's salary? I mean, you don't get paid once, don't you? 72 wives? That'd last me, what, three days? What am I supposed to do for the rest of eternity? Yeah, well, the least paradise could offer you is endless variety. So, Stevie, what exactly are you hoping to find out here? You know I can't take this Pakistani piece of shit outside of the perimeter. Just a story beyond the usually embedded journalists getting soldier's takes on virgins in paradise, buddy. Oh, you know our mother's love those kinds of stories. [gunfire] Get down! Get down! Oh, fuck. Fuck. [gunfire] Get down! [yelling] Under enemy fire. Coordinates, latitude-- Oh, fuck. [gunfire] Jesus. Fuck. [gunfire] Holy fuck! [gunfire] [car on road, voices speaking] [car doors closing] [engine revving] [SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Please, you got-- I promise, you got the wrong guy! Please! Please! Please, I didn't do anything! Please! Please, no! Oh, no! No, please! No, no, no, no! [music playing] We weren't spying. We were just looking for a place to buy a Coke, and we got lost. American, you don't see the infiltration of something as ordinary as that as a slap against our people? We need tough leaders and strong morals to survive. Not a soft set. You follow it [foreign word]. Ask your Russian friends. We never asked for this war. But the math proves different. America has been in one war or another every generation. You obviously are not a religion of peace. But what are you? A nation of warmongers? No one is innocent. Injustice has been made by both sides. You murder our people by the score and you want us to bend your way. How can a father who has lost his entire family side with you? How is my piety equal to your gratuity? There has to be an end, a reconciliation. Surely a man of your wealth and education could influence this. Don't assume what you have not lived, American. And don't try to compare me with puppets who would sell their people for silver! I've spent my coin for a better cost. And yet you revel in your position. And you use yours to spread your falsehood. It's not my intention to argue with you. I know that my government has done grievous things. I'm just looking for an interview. I thought you were looking for a Coke. Yes, and an interview with an American boy. What American boy? I thought I heard a voice the other day at a shop. It sounded like a westerner. There is no American boy here. Then I've been mistaken. I'm a journalist. I could be of more use to you. If you wish, let me tell your side of things. Let me interview you. What I wish is for your dogs of war to leave my people in peace. [music playing] [foreign speech] How are you you, my old friend? I have had better days. As have we all. I've arranged a better doctor for you. Well, the last one said a walk in the morning would help. But it hasn't. Still, here I am. You want to go back? Forward is always better, especially at this age. I know you already know that. How do you know that? You've never looked any other way. I know you're ambition. Don't think I don't. The journalist-- --Misbah will take care of him. Is that wise of her? Is there any alternative? There's only the inevitable-- how far along is the American boy? It will take time. Are you suggesting something? Send the boy to me. Let us see what he's made of. [music playing] (WHISPERING) Come, Rashid. Come, come. Shh. Silence! Come, come, come, come. Come. Come on, Samih. Sit here. You talking to me now? He can't hold both of us. Oh, sure he can. [speaks foreign language] Come on. I want you to see what they do with Americans. My name is Steve Winthrop. I'm an American journalist. I was spying when I was captured. My honorable captors demand the immediate release of all Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, all Islamic brothers from imperialist prisons-- We should get out of here. Ah, just wait. Maybe they'll kill him. If these demands are not met within 24 hours, my honorable captors will have no other choice but to kill me for the sins committed against Islam and its people. [music playing] Samih, you come with me. Samih, I have a favor to ask of you. Anything you wish, Kamil Khan. Good boy. Often, obedience is lost on youth. But even the Americans couldn't deprive you of the wisdom your father gave to you. The American spy journalist? You wish I talk to him? Such a smart boy. That is why children rule the world. When would you like me to talk to him? The prophet teaches us that it is great treachery to tell your brother something he accepts as truth but that you know is a lie. Yet that is what these Americans do. And this spy journalist uses words in treacherous ways. Saba Khan says you have progressed well, Samih, but I'm not sure you are ready. I will not let you down, Kamil Khan. When you please me, know that Allah is pleased. Go. Set him right. [coughing] [music playing] STEVE: What is this? So you wanted to speak with the American boy, right? This is him. He will give you your interview. You expect me to, uh, write with my hands tied? Nobody reads anymore. We'll tape this. What's your name? Samih. Samih. Hi, Samih. I'm Steve. Your brother's the one that bombed that school? He was a hero. No doubt, one person's terrorist is another's freedom fighter, right? He really buried the lead on his American heritage, though, huh? i guess the accent on the tape he made didn't work. Should have had better coaches. So what, now you're here to correct a mistake? I wonder when they're going to stop sending children to do their dirty work. Grown-ups send you out to do this, too. Do you have any other family, just in case you screw up your mission, too? They're all dead. No, they're not. See, when you've been doing my job for a while, you get really good at picking out who's lying. My mother. How much did she sell you for? She didn't. We take care of each other. Is that why you're here instead of home? They're educating me. Educating? Is that what they call brainwashing these days? You were spying. They caught you. Whatever happens, you have brought it upon yourself. Is that how you really feel? Or is this just the educated martyr coming out in you? I have no problem laying my life down for the cause. You're 12. The only cause you should be thinking about is girls and what band you want to form to get them. Is that the choice you give children of Palestine before you drop bombs on their heads? Why do you want to kill people? No Muslim wants to kill. But when one is under attack, one must defend oneself. I'm not attacking you. I write for a living. One million Iraqis dead from American attacks. Do you write about them? American justice is only selective at best. You say live and let live. But you have made it kill or be killed for us. So why do you ask us to be merciful? You're just twisting words, Samih. I could show you a load of people starting up at the top of the Vatican who do the exact same thing, and that doesn't make them right, either. Then everybody's wrong. They probably are. So why don't we just admit that we're all flawed and try to get along? Allah is not flawed. I never said Allah was. I said men. And prepubescent boys with death wishes, especially. You're still an American, right? I'm a Muslim first. Yeah, well your friends are trying to sell you off as an American, same way they did your brother. I am a Muslim! When you were an American kid growing up in America just two short years ago, did you watch "Star Wars"? What? "Star Wars." Did you watch it? What does this have to do-- Did you know that it's an allegory between man and religion? Faith is the force. There are those who use it for good and those who use it for evil. Luke sees black and white, right and wrong. But the problem is that Darth Vader's his father. And that complicates things. He gets angry. He leaves his training. He wants to blow things up. Do you understand what I'm trying to say to you? I don't. Yes you do, Samih. What they're doing to me is wrong, Samih. And you know this. And what they're filling your head in with is darkness because you've seen the other side. Do no go down this path, Samih! It is darkness, and it will slowly eat-- Come on, Samih. There's no discussing things with them. They only dictate. They don't listen. [music playing] [screaming] [screaming in pain] [screaming continues] SAMIH: Steve? Steve. Samih? Yeah, it's me. Should get out of here, kid. If you get caught, you're gonna get in trouble. You were screaming this morning. Yeah, losing a couple fingernails will do that to you. When they let you go, will you find my mother? Yeah. SAMIH: Tell her I'm all right, not too worry. Of course, Samih. She always worries too much. Yeah, mine too. No girl ever loves you quite like your mother, do they? I never saw the last "Star Wars." I mean, the new ones. I left before. I'm-- I'm gonna go now. Samih? Yeah? Take care of yourself. [music playing] Please, where are we going? What's going on? Samih, please! Are you there, Samih? Please don't! Oh, please! Samih! Samih, please! Are you there, Samih? Tell them they don't have to do this, Samih! [music playing] [screaming] No! No! No! No! Samih, please! Please! Please stay! Please! Please! [foreign speech] [sobbing] [screaming] Samih, please! Please! Please, Samih! Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come. STEVE: Give us this day our daily bread. [continuing prayer] [Steve praying] [SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [glass breaking] [screaming] [music playing] MALE SPEAKER: He's your responsibility now. KAMIL: You are the future! ZAFAR: Will you work hard for a mission I give you? Samih, I'm not sure you're ready. SAMIH: I will not let you down, Kamil Khan. Hey, Samih! So Rashid is Yushua's brother, huh? I guess he had to take the blame to protect the retard But why? I mean, the idiot. It was you, wasn't it? [glass breaking] Save that anger for your true enemy, Samih. Zafar Khan? Do you wish to say something, Samih? What is Allah's will for me? I will do it. [music playing] [thunder and lightning] MALE SPEAKER: Wake up, Samih! Wake up! Wake up, Samih! Wake up! Wake up! What were you dreaming about? A well. It was in my village. I fell in it shortly after we moved back. If it hadn't been for my brother-- he saved me. What's your name? Afsa. Samih. I know. Come. Sit down here. Do you want to eat something? Yes. Afsa? Bring something for him to eat. Are you eating? She will eat later. You first. We are doubly blessed to have had two martyrs from one family under our roof. Your brother. Afsa witnessed his march into paradise. He died heroically. Excuse me. [music playing] There, across the street. That is the American consulate. Zafar Khan has it targeted in two days. Usually on a weekday, when it's working, it's pretty crowded with job-seekers, visa-seekers, and even protesters. You need to mingle in the crowd, get to the gate, and tell the guards that you're an American citizen who has lost his parents. They should believe your accent. And, uh, even if they don't-- even if they don't, your martyrdom will be just as effective. Do you understand? Yes. Tarek will be meeting us and showing us the device that you'll be using. [music playing, street noises] The uniform of soldier. It's good to see you again, Samih. I trust Amir Khan has been taking care of you. He has been most kind. Has Amir Khan taken you through the task? Yes. Trigger, timer. Boom! Samih, I have to go. See you soon. Do you wish another one? If you allow it. Anything you wish, Samih. Samih, close your eyes. What do you hear? [street noises] Traffic. People. Shop. Life? In order to do the task you have set out to do, you have to accept an end to all of this. These sights, these sounds, these senses, to a life of marriage, children, the pursuit of any dreams that you may have had. I know what I'm doing. Do you? Your mother is still alive. She's already lost a son. Do you really wish to see her lose another? Won't she miss you? Why are you asking me such questions? Doubt is as strong of an encourager as faith. My brother had doubts. His faith won over at the end, did it not? Samih, we have to say goodbye to a thousand things when we choose the time of our passing. It is-- it is not wrong to feel conflicted. I am not the one conflicted. What I lose here, I will get in paradise. That is where my brother will be waiting and my father. You should be cautious in your tones. People might think things. I-- I was just trying to see how resolute you are in your convictions. I see you are. I'm not thirsty anymore. OK. [foreign speech] [music playing] Don't you want to watch? She should cover herself up. AMIR: God forbid that a man find a woman attractive or find joy in song. Samih, when someone cannot express themselves, Are you with us, Amir Khan? Yes, Samih. I am with you in any direction you choose to take. I choose the direction I am on. [foreign speech] [music playing on radio] I'm so sorry. Please don't tell my grandmother. I won't. It's disrespectful of me in the face of what's to come. I apologize. There's no need. And I won't tell. Thank you. What was that song? Actually, your brother gave it to me. Do you want to listen to it? [music playing on radio] Your future is in paradise. It's not in this world. And certainly not in this house. [music playing] [foreign speech] My name is Samih Mohammed. I was born in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States of America. I grew up under tyranny of hypocrisy, which you term Western culture. In this culture, I was brainwashed, pulled away from piety and respect that a child should be taught. My father, Mahmud Mohammed, and my brother, Rasin Mohammed, saw this. My name is Rasin Mohammed, son of Mahmud Mohammed. Helping our people, and returning me to my birthright. They have succeeded on every level. To my mother, I pay the respects that every child should and know that she will understand this sacrifice. It should be every mother's joy to see that a child has been chosen for such an honor and blessing as the one that I have. What I do today is in the name of Allah the merciful. And by this act, you will know that a son of America has seen the truth. Today, a son of America-- And you too will know to seek it. [music playing] [PRAYING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] To you alone we worship, and alone we pray for help. [PRAYING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] AMIR: Guide us to the straight path, the path of those whom you favored, the prophet and his successors. [PRAYING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] AMIR: Not of those who incurred your wrath, nor of those who have gone astray. Samih, my son, it is important to know what we say and more so what it means. It is very easy to lose sight of oneself when one stops seeking himself. Look at your hands. Just as two fingers are made equal, God made all of mankind equal. God does not show mercy to those who are unkind to mankind. These are the prophet's words. [music playing] AFSA: May I come in, Samih? Yeah. I wanted to apologize again. I have not been completely honest with you. Your brother was here much longer than you were. We grew close. Nothing happened. You must believe this. We were just fond of each other. I loved talking to him. I didn't want him to leave. I wasn't at the college to watch him martyr himself. I pulled a wire... and thought that he would just be arrested. And then we could-- and he would escape. I stayed to pray. But by the time I came out, they'd already shot him. [gunshot] He just stared. And all I could do was turn and run. He was so proud of you, Samih. When you see him in paradise, tell him I'm sorry. I should not have put myself ahead of Allah's will. [music playing] I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Samih. I was just horsing around before. Wake up, Samih! Wake up! Wake up, Samih. Wake up! I didn't mean to push you. Wake up! Wake up, Samih! Thank Allah you are alive. [music playing] Samih? I'll take Afsa and Grandma out in a little while. You better leave in a little while after us. And may Allah show you the path of righteousness. [protesters chanting] [music playing] Run! Yushua! Yushua! [music playing] Yushua! Yushua! Samih! [both yelling] Samih! Yushua! TAREK: Yushua! Yushua! Yushua! Yushua! Yushua! [music playing]
