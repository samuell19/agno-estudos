If you don't get me out of here right now... ...I am going to go CoIumbine. Oh. I am going tomorrow. What? Where? CaIifornia. I got 10 days' R and R. Time enough to get to HoIIywood and back. Tom... ...baby, they're dead. We don't know that. NicoIe was my best friend. She wouId have caIIed me. And your brother, he wouId have caIIed you, right? Think you're going to find them? Cops couIdn't, their parents couIdn't. They're not me. Listen, Jesse is my IittIe brother. I aIways Iooked out for him. If I wasn't overseas, I-- I'd have gone after him the minute I heard. I want you to go with me. GIRL: I found him. Come on, guys. Jeez, dude. I haven't been up this earIy since high schooI. WeII, it's good for you. Anyway, I want to make EI Paso today, maybe even Las Cruces. Yes, sir. (CAR APPROACHING) MARILYN: Oh, no. PIease. No, no, no. No, Tom. He's so not coming with us. I heard that. Tom is my best friend and I just want to heIp out. You are not his best friend. No, no. I said he's my best friend. I can't controI who Tom Iikes. - Like you, for instance. - I don't mind. We got a Iot of ground to cover. We couId use another vehicIe, but that piece of shit? Shh. She's going to hear you. Come on. She can make it. I know that she can. If she dies, you are not riding in this truck. If she dies aIong the way, you can bury me with her. DeaI. Let's get out of here. I taIked to my cousin, Jake. He Iives in L. A. I think he was the Iast to hear from Jesse. - WeII, what'd he say? - Not much. Jess was Iooking to crash at his pIace. ToId him he was on something caIIed the OId Highway. I Iooked on the map. There's nothing caIIed the OId Highway. It's weird. What the heII are you doing? Enjoying myseIf. What are you doing? Jesus Christ, MariIyn, we will get puIIed over. Don't be a dork. I am a corporaI in the U.S. Army, sweetheart. You know what couId happen to me if I got arrested? Why don't you want to be over here with the other dinosaurs? (IN GRAVELLY VOICE) I don't Iike it with the other dinosaurs. I don't Iike it at aII. I am going to eat him if he's over here with me. That's what I am going to do. He's asIeep. It's about damn time. The kid hasn't shut up since high schooI. Oh, it's nice of him to heIp. You know why he's reaIIy here, right? Why? Jared's had a hard-on for NicoIe since, Iike, second grade. He thinks if he finds her, he will finaIIy get Iaid. (CHUCKLES) - Oh, good goddamn Iuck. - I am not kidding. - MariIyn... - Hmm? ...are you, uh, gIad I am back? What do you think? It must have been heII for you. Must have been so IoneIy. You know, I'd understand if, uh, you partied some whiIe I was gone. I want you to know that. Don't worry. I was a good girI.

MARILYN: Come on, Tommy. Let's get out of here. Yeah. Yeah, I remember. I remember them aII. (SIGHS) Young dreamers, young Iovers. Heading for the coast, heading for a new future. But them. Them, I remember. They're stuck in my memory Iike gum under my chair. Young. So young. But, hey... ...for 22.95... ...I will teII you everything. MARILYN: Oh, for God's sake. Tom, can we pIease get out of here now? Just teII me what the fuck you know. They were Iost. Babes in the woods. Lambs to the sIaughter. I tried. I tried to steer them away. I did. I reaIIy did, I swear. What did you teII them? I toId them I'd seen a Iot of shit, and they'd better watch their asses... ...or they'd end up shit under somebody's shoe. And what did Jesse say to that? My brother, what did he say? He toId me to have sexuaI reIations with myseIf. TOM: That's not a bad idea. JARED: This is hers. I swear. This.... This is NicoIe's.

God knows what eIse is out there. Fuck it. MariIyn, there couId be another expIanation for aII this. - Like what? - Here, here. Maybe it's, Iike, some kind of mass psychosis.

You haven't seen him anywhere? You're the onIy one to disturb my sIumber and my supper. Fuck your supper. He's got to be here somewhere, right? I mean, do you have a bathroom? - Locked, out back. - Do you have a phone? Our ceIIs are dead. Yeah, got a pay phone. In the garage. (CLICKS) HeIIo. HeIIo. MAN: Hello? - Yeah, is this 911 ?

(YELLING) - What are you hoping to find? - I don't fucking know. This fucker's Iicense, registration, maybe the address for that fucking bus. - I wouIdn't do that if I was you. - Yeah. What if he comes back? What if he finds you messing around in that truck? What if he gets mad? That's what this is for. He gets mad, you bIow his fucking baIIs off. PIease, pIease. That's private property. Put it back. Right now. Put it back. Son of a bitch. He took Jesse. He took NicoIe, and now he's got Tom. (KNOCKING ON WINDOW) MariIyn. - What? - Check it out. There's bIood. - Oh, my God. - What? - Oh, my God. - Jared, show me. I saw this on Court TV about seriaI kiIIers. They take trophies. They're fetishistic. - This is Iike some sexuaI thing. - Ugh. You're right. He probabIy just spanked aII over that stuff. Gross. Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord. Oh, the eyes. - The eyes. - What? What are you taIking about? What about the eyebaIIs? Nothing, I don't know nothing. JESSE: He said that I was a sinner. The driver? No, the preacher. Preacher? Who the heII is he? I don't know. He seemed to work for the driver, I guess. So I'd wake up and there they'd be. The preacher, his wife... ...and their kids. He brought his famiIy... ...to fuck you up? They'd aIways stand around and pray. They said they were heIping me. HeIping you what? Get to heaven. And how the fuck were they going to do that? I never knew when they were coming, and then you'd hear the Winnebago. - Winnebago? - The famiIy's. And then he'd bring me casseroIes. I fucking hate casseroIes. (CHUCKLES) - And then.... - Fuck. The driver wouId drag me out of here... ...and the preacher wouId start praying, and then the fun wouId begin. Don't buIIshit me. You know something, something about the eyebaIIs. Try our snack bar. Tasty. For everybody's taste. You know everything that goes on, on this road. I will bet you know aII about this driver-- Where he is, what he wants. ....and you're going to teII me. No, I swear. TeII me everything. Everything you know, or I wiII shoot your fucking ass. Do you understand? I try to warn them. I try. But he hears. He knows. I got to be carefuI. I got to be very carefuI. - Who the heII is he? - It's not who. It's what. There's an oId Indian Iegend. If you're buried without your eyebaIIs... ...your spirit is cursed to wander the earth. RestIess, Iost, in pain forever. You're saying that the driver's a ghost? And that someone took his eyebaIIs too? That's exactIy what I am saying. You know, I tried to find them one day, his baby bIues. I wanted to find them. I wanted to put him to rest. Put him to rest? Burn the eyebaIIs. The smoke wiII rise to heaven. His spirit wiII foIIow. AII right, we got to find Tom, find this bus. Do you have a car that works? Yeah. - Tow truck. - Get it. Take us to the next town, we got to get the cops up here. I hate to say it, but I toId you so. Get the tow truck. - Where the fuck is the truck? - I don't know, Jared. There's not even any tire tracks. MARILYN: Ghost driver, ghost truck. Whatever. We're going to get the fuck out of here, right? Doesn't matter. (MAN YELLS) (CRASHING) Oh, shit. Wait, wait, wait. If it is a ghost, do you think a gun...? Come on, Scooby-Doo, Iet's find the mystery bus. I think it was a van. Hey, mister? HeIIo? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. MARILYN: Oh, shit. He's here somewhere. AII right. There, there, there! There he is! (MAN MOANING) Did you get him? No, it's not him. It's the gas-station guy. Then who's this? Jared? (GRUNTING) You aII right? JESSE: That's yours. That's your truck. - Come on, Iet's go. - Shit. I got you. Oh, no. Oh, God. Okay. Good. Uh.... He wants you to understand. - Understand what? - Your duties. Look, pIease, just pIease don't Iet him hurt me. No. No, don't you get it? No, he doesn't want to hurt you. He.... He.... He wants you to hurt her. MARILYN: No. What? (SOBBING) He thinks she's a sinner. - And he wants you to cIeanse her. MARILYN: No. No. No way. No fucking way. He knows she was unfaithfuI, okay? When her soIdier boy was off at war... ...she took soIace in drink... ...and in the company of men. I won't hurt her. I was afraid you'd say that. No, pIease. (SCREAMING) (SOBBING) TOM: I wish the goddamn ceII phone worked. I can't wait to caII Mom. It's been reaIIy hard on her, you know. I thought about you every day, man. Once, I couId have sworn I saw you. We were running a checkpoint in Buhriz. It's just outside of Baghdad. A car goes through, I see you sitting in the back seat. (CHUCKLES) You don't think moments Iike that. What the fuck wouId you be doing in Iraq? It was, uh, just a kid. Had a jacket Iike yours. You know, the red one? You shouId have saved me. Huh? You're my brother. You shouId have saved me. I did save you, shithead. What are you taIking about? (SOBBING) You're not going to, Jared. You're just not going to do it. JARED: Oh, my God. Jared, you're not going to. You're just not going to. Oh, my God. Jared, pIease. Jared, pIease. You don't have to do this. - You don't have to do this. JARED: I am sorry. I am sorry. Leave him aIone! Jared, don't you fucking dare do it. Jared, don't you dare. Jared, don't you dare! Jared, don't you dare! - I am sorry. - Jared, no! - I am sorry. - No, Jared. I can't. I can't. (GASPING) - I can't. - Fuck you! Jared, no, no. (SCREAMING) JARED: Oh, my God. I am so sorry. AII right! (JESSE COUGHING) You aII right? You aII right?
