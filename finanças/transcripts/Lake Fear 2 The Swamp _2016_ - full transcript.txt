Come on. - Tell them the best part about going there. - If we get one snake. We catch it, five hundred dollars.

Thanks. - [Nicole] Are you gonna catch some snakes with us? - I got my snake. - [Nicole] You two hold hands, aww. - [Girls] Aww! - [Anna] Oh oh, look at these cuties. - Stop! - I think you guys look cute together I'm not gonna lie. - We are just friends. - [Tyler] Patrick, are you a pussy or are you a bro, dog? - [Patrick] A bro! - [Tyler] You're a bro? - [Patrick] I'm a bro. - Tell me! - I'm a bro! - Yeah!

Henry, ho! - Hey. - [Tyler] Hey how you doing. You Henry? - Ah no. Hold on for a second. Henry Gerald. - [Henry] Yeah. - [Ticket Man] Come over here, we got some kids for you. - [Henry] Some kids? - [Ticket Man] Yeah. - Yes sir, what can we do for you this afternoon? - [Tyler] Hey, how you doing? Yeah, you're Henry right? - Cus, cousin, cousin Henry? - Yeah, Henry Gerald, I've got aliases you know. [Laughing] - You know we just wanted to come out here and have a good time. We're looking to get a, you know, rowdy, a little, have a little more fun then we were having. We want to do something different. It was this kids idea. Your cousin sent us down here to see about some, some Everglade tour, some, some boat action or what not. - [Derek] We want to see some some snakes. - [Tanya] And the sights. - This man wants to see some snakes. - [Derek] Yeah, I want to see some snakes. - Yeah, well you know, we do have snakes and gators out here, but I, I, but hate to tell you all guys this, but you know but because of the bad weather, we've shut down for the day, you know. - Yeah we came. - [Derek] We came all the way from the beach. - We drove, fuckin' like, thirty minutes. - Let me take a look at some of the girls you got with you, well, we might be able to work something out. Oh yeah, I like that. - Oh yeah, I bet, not this one. [Laughing] - So if it was to get a little bit of water in us out here, it would really look better, huh? - It would, it would. - A lot better. - [Tyler] Uh oh. - I tell ya, are you students okay? - A hundred and fifty cash and the best time of your life. - Yeah. - Will you? - We came to party. - Alright. - [Nicole] Promise me their won't be a lot of snakes there, right? - There won't be more then we can handle now, I'll promise you that. - [Derek] What else are we going to see? - [Henry] Well, there's some wild people. - For real? - Wild people? - We the wildest yo, we the, we the, we the gorillas! - [Anna] We're the wild ones. Yeah! - The gorillas, the gorillas! - Yeah, you're a great group, I'd be glad to take you out for a little bit. - [Derek] You'll take us out? - Yeah, well thank you captain Henry, my man. - [Derek] Let's do it. You really came through. - Alright, let's do it, yo. - [Derek Yeah, let's do it. Let's go! - Watch your step now down here. - Be some gators. - Let's go. - Sounds good to me. - [Anna] Everybody butts heads, we're going. - Watch you're step getting in. Don't fall in face first, you'll get all scarred up, and nobody want to look at ya anymore. [Foreboding music] - Let's go! - Let's do it. - Well, these cuts like this is where the alligators build their nest. The fact is a nest right back down in there, kinda of a hollow spot, they like this, because the big open are like this right here, and they can see any predators coming. You don't very often see them out there in that thick stuff because they can't see what's coming on. - [Nicole] What's that smell? - [Henry] Well you might not want to know, that, that, well two things. It's not an aligator okay, the truth of the matter is this is decaying vegetation out here that's causing this smell. - [Tyler] Hey, my man? - [Henry] Yes sir. - [Tyler] Hey, when a, these snakes where they hiding out at? - Well, we're gonna go on over here. By the ridge of grass over here, and I've seen a few of them over there, so we gonna go look for 'em, on that side over there. Look down there in the grass. It's a cat tail, what they call a cat tail. If you look real close you'll see one of those snakes coiled up right there. It's about six feet from us, big old snake coiled up, right there. A little bit further, little further out, you're looking a little bit to close to the boat, little further out. Yep, curled up there, kind of green with some black stripes in it, that's called an Everglades green snake. They get pretty big out here. - [Anna] Are they venomous? - Yes they are. If they bite you on the ass I'll suck the venom out for you. [Group laughs] - [Tyler] I like this guy. I like this fucking guy. - [Anna] I still don't see him. - Well, you could just walk out there I guess, find it that way. Just pretend that your going in there for a skinny dipping, just take your clothes off, run right on up in there. Yeah, we do it out here all the time. - [Tanya] How deep does it go? - [Tyler] Yeah, Derek my man. Derek you a pussy or you a bro? - [Derek] Come on Tyler. - You and me, let's go. - You a pussy or you a, you, I know I'm a bro. Oh yo, step right up, this is your plan, this is your idea, brother. - It's not like their even gonna catch it anyways. I don't know what the big deal is. - [Henry] It's about six foot out. - Oh, you're so sweet. - They're not gonna catch any snakes. Oh, there's a small one, I'm scared, where's the big ones. - [Henry] About a foot and a half out here. - Whatever, the boat ride's kind of fun but this is dumb. - [Leah] The boat ride is more then fun. - [Henry] Let's move on, there's gotta be more out here. - Here's something of interest. An old camp out in here in the Everglades. It goes back many, many years. It was actually started back in 1953. There's a lot of history behind it, and it's not all good. It was actually it was started by hunters that used to live out here and make their living out here and a lot of people have been injured out here, and it's been said that a few have died. At least one man tried to burn it down. But not too many people want to go in there, because you just don't know. It's just one of them places that I've kind of shunned and stayed away from because it's just bad karma. - Does anyone live there? - Oh no, nobody lives there. I mean, no, nobody in their right mind lives there. It hasn't been well taken care of, so I just tend to stay away from it myself cause you just don't never know what's gonna happen next out here next in the Everglades. A lot of people carry guns with them because they've had some real bad stories. - It's a fucking tourist story alright, calm down. - [Toni] It sounds like a secret party that no one knows about except for us. - [Henry] Yeah, that'd be an awesome party right there. - [Nicole] I think I'll just stay in the boat. - [Tanya] I'm with her on that one. - [Nicole] I'll be fine. - Well. - [Nicole] Head home, you know. - Yeah, we got some weather moving in, so it'd probably be a good time for us to start working our way back in. - Yeah guys, I mean, my drunk is faded, let' go get some booze. - Yes. - Derek, good idea but I think you know. - Don't want to be out here after dark. - [Derek] Hell no, definitely not. - [Tanya] We can all agree, we don't want that. - [Marcus] Oh no, fuck that. - [Derek] Even I don't want to be here at dark. - [Tyler] Yeah fuck your snakes. - [Jocelyn] You're so funny. - [Derek] Is everything good? - [Marcus] Oh that's awesome. - [Derek] What happened? - [Tyler] Yo, quit dicking around. - The break jams out of the way, now so. - [Anna] Oh, he's fucking with us. - No big deal. - [Toni] Come on Gerald. - [Anna] What? - [Tyler] I swear to God, if this fucking boat doesn't start. - [Derek] Is everything okay? - [Toni] Has this happened before? - Like is it normal for you boat to die? - [Marcus] Fuck that, what's wrong with the boat? - [Tyler] Come on, my man. - [Nicole] Are you sure you're okay? - Junk Japanese shit. Raggedy ass boat, this thing always been, one damn damn problem after the other. - Henry my man, I mean, oh come on it's cool, it was funny, but, like, let's go, brother. - He doesn't look okay. - [Henry] Damn it! Ah shit. - [Marcus] We're in the middle of bum fuck nowhere. - [Tankya] What can we do like. - [Jocelyn] Oh my god. - [Toni] Maybe, don't, don't stand. - [Nicole] Tyler, be careful, just sit down. - [Tyler] Hey man, you alright? Yeah we gotta get back, can drive this thing? - [Anna] Does anybody have water in their backpack? - Somebody got some water. Get it, hurry up. Give him the fucking water bottle. What you got? - What do you need in here? You sick or some shit? - You need a [stutters]. - [Tanya] Just open it and maybe we can guess. - [Tyler] I can't fucking open it. - [Tanya] Just try it. - [Tyler] Shit! Hey, hey, Henry, Henry, Henry. Henry, Henry! - [Jocelyn] Get him up on his, get him up, make sure he can breathe! - [Tyler] Fucking Christ, Henry! Look in the box, the fucking box, look for a pill bottle or some shit. Yo Henry! - [Nicole] Henry, are you okay?! [Kids yelling over one another] - [Anna] Pills probably! - [Marcus] A fucking flashlight. - [Nicole] Does anybody know CPR? - [Jocelyn] Why is this happening? - [Marcus] Fuck! - [Nicole] I can't get his pulse. - [Jocelyn] Oh my god. - [Anna] Give him CPR, somebody give him CPR. Tyler do something. - What? Stop yelling at me it's not my fault. - [Anna] Tyler do something. - What do want me to do. - [Marcus] Dude, calm the fuck down. We gotta get the fuck outta here. - [Jocelyn] This is all your fucking fault. - [Tyler] I know we do! [Kids yelling] - Hey, hey. - Hey, calm down! - [Tyler] Alright.

Does anybody have service? - [Marcus] My phone's dead. - [Nicole] Oh my god. - [Jocelyn] There's no signal. - [Anna] Does anyone else have a signal? - [Patrick] Did you check for a radio? - [Marcus] Check this shit! - [Tanya] Radio, flare, flashlights, anything? - [Marcus] We got a flashlight, guys. Okay worst case scenario we got a flashlight. - Hey! - [Jocelyn] It's already gone. - [Anna] No flares. - Hey come on, can you hear me? - [Nicole] There's literally nothing in here. - I can't even open this. Tyler, look a medical kit. - [Nicole] He has fucking head phones, that's it. - I don't know what the fuck to do with it. - We're running out of daylight, let's at least make it to the cabin, so we have shelter at least. We're in the middle of fucking nowhere. - [Derek] Dude, we can't stay here all night. - [Anna] I don't want to get off the boat. - [Toni] Did you not hear what he said though? - [Marcus] We're in a boat in the middle of nowhere. We need to do something! Okay let's go. - We're gonna get in this water? - [Derek] Let's do it, we only have one option. - [Toni] Which is? - [Derek] We gotta make it to there! - [Toni] How? - [Derek] It's right there. We can make it. - [Tanya] Oh, oh my gosh, don't get in there. Oh my god. Be careful. - [Anna] Don't you hop in there, too. - [Tanya] Oh my god, ah! - [Jocelyn] My shoe's stuck! - [Marcus] Let's go, one foot in front of the other, guys, let's go, let's go. - [Jocelyn] I lost my shoe! - [Tanya] Oh my God. I lost it, it's gone. - [Jocelyn] This isn't funny, guys, this isn't funny, this isn't funny. - [Tyler] Just give me your hand, give me your fucking hand. - [Jocelyn] I can't. - [Tyler] Give me your hand, let's just go. - [Jocelyn] Oh my god! [Screaming] - [Anna] We're almost there, we're almost there. - [Derek] Keep moving! - [Nicole] It's just grass. - [Derek] Keep moving! - [Nicole] It's just grass.

I don't have cell phone service, so everybody else needs to check their phones for service. - [Marcus] Come on let's get in the house. - [Anna] Come on let's go, everybody take their phones out. - [Marcus] Sit, sit, sit. - [Nicole] Who has their phone? My phones gonna die. I don't have service. - [Patrick Does anyone have service? - [Marcus] Let me get the camera, Leah, camera. - [Jocelyn] Oh, this stings and burns. - [Nicole] I think it's just a scratch. - [Tanya] Is it alright though? - [Derek] I got like no battery, fuck. - [Tanya] Does this place even have electricity? - [Marcus] Let's check inside. - [Anna] Be careful. - [Marcus] Obviously. - [Nicole] Hey, we can not go in there! - [Anna] Shh.

Educated idiots! - [Hank] You ain't lying about that, daddy. - [Otis] Amen. - [Marcus] Whoa. - [Derek] Whoa. - Derek, we are in probably the last place we are ever gonna see because I doubt that busted ass boat got a GPS on it.
