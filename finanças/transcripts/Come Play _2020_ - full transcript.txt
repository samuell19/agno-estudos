I don't understand what you're talking about. What is this "great"? Like I'm... I'm... I'm here as often as I can be. I'm on two jobs. I don't know what else do you want me to do. MISUNDERSTOOD MONSTERS A Children's Story This is Larry. Larry never gets to play pretend. He gets made fun of because he is different. Larry just wants a friend. Oliver! We're okay. We're okay. What happened, huh? Can you use your words, please? Here you go. Something in house. Something in house. That was probably just a nightmare. Cause there is nobody in the house but your Mom and your Dad. All right, come here. Come here. Come here. Can you take some deep breaths for me, huh? Okay? We gonna do some deep breaths. All right? So, he woke up in the middle of the night, screaming. I went in there. I was up for two hours with him. He's a little boy. He has nightmares. It's easy for you to say. You never go in with him. It's always me. I slept through it. All right? I'm sorry. Don't do that. Why can't you just admit that you don't want to help? I help. Okay? I always help when I'm awake. Hey, buddy. No more nightmares, huh? I heard you had a bad dream, bud? Need a hug? I know what the problem is. Too far away! Yup, let's see. Ten feet? That's definitely too far for a hug. What do you think five feet is? Okay. Little closer. I'm getting the weirdest reading on this thing. It's just.... Tummy tickles! Your throne, sir. Are you able to make it to a speech therapy today? Sorry, I can't. I picked up a shift at a parking lot. Well, hopefully you can make one soon, right? Yeah. For sure. Are we moving? Are we moving? You are not moving anywhere. Okay? So don't worry. Today we're gonna start in with multiplying more than two number. Not cool, man. You don't even know what you're groaning about. It's not so hard. If you can multiply two numbers you can multiply three. Make sure you pay attention to the lesson, okay? Come on, you learn by trying. Nobody? Oliver? What do you make of this three numbers? The answer is eight. - The answer is eight. - Not quite. I see what you did there though. You were adding instead of multiplying. Very good try, Oliver. Anyone else wanna give it a go? Go ahead, Byron. How come Oliver still gets to use his phone in the class but you took mine away? - He's autistic, dude. - So he gets special treatment? Oliver gets to use his phone because he wasn't playing Fortnite during the Pledge of Allegiance. Let's get back to our first pair. Product of two and four. Why don't we start there? Hey, what's up? Do you wanna come hang out with us? Where? It's just... I saw something cool over there. That way. I'll catch up in a sec. Friends? Hello? Hey! - I can't believe he actually fell for it. - Of course he did. He's such a loser. Is he having a heart attack? He totally is. We should call 911. Dude, dude, listen. That's just how he talks. Moaner-boner. Like, he can't even talk, he's like... - Exactly. - Hey, maybe he's a robot under skin? Moaner-boner thinks he's special. Oh, did you wanna say something? I can't believe you should be friends with moaner-boner over there. My Mom made me. I didn't want to. You're very ugly. Who's ugly now? Come on! I didn't know what to think when I pulled up and he wasn't there waiting for me. I went right into the worst case scenarios. Did he get in trouble? Did someone take him? And then I found him just screaming in the field. That's sounds very scary for both of you. And he lost his phone somehow. I wish he could explain what happened. Good. Now we're gonna try using our words. Lost in field. We're gonna work on your f's, okay? F's can be tricky. Field. Field. Can you try that? Oliver, you can do it. Okay, good practicing. Have you been trying to provide him with social experiences like we discussed? Poor guy still doesn't have any friends. You said he was hanging out with your friend's son? Jennifer's son, Byron. Yeah, we're not close anymore. Okay, so, if you can make any effort to help him find friends. Take him to birthday parties, anything. It can be a good way to get him to open up. And just like he's trying to get better at talking, we have to make sure we're listening. Come on, Oliver, you gotta stay with me, okay? Five bucks, please. Thanks a lot. Oliver, take that box off. - Oh, buddy. - It's time to brush your teeth. - He's full of energy tonight. - Yeah, he is. Where did you get that? Took from "lost & found" at work. I think it just needs to be charged. I guess you like it, huh? Be careful with the screen, it has a little crack. - What? - You know what. I run around our son all day and you get to swoop in and be the hero once again? A hero? It's not all presents and tummy tickles with me like it is with you. I just wish I could take that part of him and put it in the box and tape it up and hide it somewhere so I don't have to deal with it. Then he wouldn't be our Oliver. I should've... I should've taken him sooner. What if he never learns to talk because I didn't do anything for so long? We didn't do anything. He has never looked me in the eyes. Do you know what it's like for your own child to never look you in the eyes? Well... He's got nice eyes, if that helps. No, Marty, it doesn't help. Because he loves you and he hates me. Is Dad gone? Is Dad gone? Yes. Hello. Who are you? I am Larry. Your friends want you to be normal. I just want to be your friend. Hi, honey. So... I just had a little chat with Jennifer. You know how Dr. Robyn's always talking about you making friends? Well, we gonna have a sleepover this weekend. I know it's scary. I'm nervous too. I haven't seen Jennifer since that whole incident, but you try and have some fun for me? You noticed your Dad's gone earlier than usual, huh? I have something I need to talk to you about. I've been wanting to talk to about it for a while but I just haven't been sure what to say. Your Dad and I love you so much. I don't want you to feel alone. That's why we gonna have a sleepover this weekend. Is that your way of saying you don't wanna talk to me about it? - Hi. - Hi, how are you? - Thank you for coming. - Nice to see you. You too. So, I hope you're gonna be okay with these guys. They can be a little bit of a handful. Oh, yeah, I think we'll be fine. Byron just felt more comfortable with his party. You're welcome to stay for a while. And to spend more time with Byron than I have to? - Mom! - Yes! I'm just kidding, honey. Not kidding. So... can I say hi? Oh yeah, of course, yes. Oliver, you remember Jennifer, right? Hi, Oliver. Why did he do that weird thing with his fingers? - Hey, be nice, guys. - No, it's okay. It helps calm him down. It's called stimming. K. But why? Well, he's under sensitive to stimulation so sometimes he needs to touch his own skin or spin in a circle and it makes him feel good. - Can he spin forever without puking? - Sure seems like it. - That's kinda cool. - Come on, Oliver. Hi, Oliver, it's really nice to see you, honey. - My Gosh, you've gotten big. - Yeah. He's so not talking but his writing has really improved. That awesome! High five? Still strong. Okay, that is not gonna happen. Because he knows now to keep his hands to himself. - Of course. - Right, Oliver? Well, the boys have all agreed to include Oliver, so I'm sure it's just gonna be a really great night. Is he gonna make those sounds the whole night? Keep it down! Isn't it sad your Mom has to force kids to come over and pretend to be your friends? What is he staring at anyway? Moaner-boner has been looking at that closet all night. Maybe that's where he keeps his secret candy stash? What? You guys are telling me you don't have a secret candy stash? I'm gonna check it out. Do you see any candy? Hey! What's your deal?! We all got these! Does he think we're gonna steal it? Let's see what kind of games you got in here. What's this? Does your Mommy still read you bedtime stories? - This is Larry. - Who's Larry? Yeah, who's Larry? - This guy. - Whoa! Look at that dude. Yeah, he looks just like your Dad. Shut up! And my Dad is way hairier. Larry never gets to play pretend. He gets made fun of because he's different. Okay, did your parents forget to pay the electricity bill? Larry just wants a friend. I guess you are so afraid of a dead light bulb. Two. Two light bulbs. He's tall, and pale, and thin. And tries to hide his face. He isn't from the world you know. Larry comes from another place. Maybe we should stop reading. Larry watches through your windows which connect his realm to yours. He needs you to know his whole story to turn those windows into doors. What does that mean? Oh my God! Oh my God! What's going on? Oh my God! What is happening? Are you making those sounds moaner-boner? What the shit is that? Shit! Shit! What the hell kinda app is this? Is it an app? Should we read the next page? I wanna read the next page. No, no! Don't read the next page! Larry has looked through the glass and found you staring back. He understands your loneliness. A true friend is what you lack. Will you be Larry's friend? No! No! I will not be Larry's friend. Guys, guys, there's nothing in the corner. No, no, no! Don't! He's going. See? It's probably just the fuse. Do you see him? Do you see Larry? Guys, there's no such thing as Larry. It's just your imagination playing tricks on you. What is happening? Oh my God! Byron, are you okay? I don't know how this happened. I don't see how Oliver could've done this. Byron? Baby? Do you think you can tell us what happened? Who did this? It was Oliver. He's a freak. Excuse me? Let's go. Jennifer... I'm sorry. I am so sorry. We gotta go. How did you blow out all of these lights? I don't understand, were you trying to hurt Byron again? Not you? Well, who else could've been? If you want friends you can't push furniture into them. Will you at least help me move this table? Please stop humming. We are not happy right now, this... Is that the Sponge Bob song? You know what, you don't have to stop. Does that help you calm down? Maybe I pushed you into this too fast. We've got a lot going on in this house and maybe we're just not ready for friends. Which one is this, North or South Dakota? - South Dakota. - That's right. Underneath South Dakota is..? - Nebraska? - Nebraska. Jade, what's under Nebraska? - Kansas. - Kansas, nice one. Oliver, do you wanna give us a try? Oliver, did you bring your talker today? Another day. And under Kansas? Iowa? Misunderstood monsters. This is Larry. Larry never gets to play pretend. He get made fun of because he's different. Larry just wants a friend. Marty? Hello? Hello? Hello. Somebody is watching me. Oliver, what the hell did you download on this thing? Say goodbye to Oliver. Have you been talking to my son? You need to stop! This is not funny! Stay away from my son, I won't let you hurt him! Not hurt. Kill. - Is everything okay? - Sorry. Is that Oliver? - Is Oliver here? - Yes. Thank God you're all right. We gotta go. We have a family emergency. So we're just gonna go. Just gonna get you home, okay? I know. I know this isn't part of your routine. It's just... Someone was watching us at home. They said they want to take you. Hi, Jen, I can't... What do you mean he's not talking? I don't know what they got up to this weekend. But Byron... He still hasn't slept. Didn't go to school. Won't eat. Two days of no talking and... I seriously don't know how you do it. I think someone hacked into Oliver's screen. Someone was talking to me. It was so creepy. How could someone use that to get to... Honey, it's nice of you to try and apologize but I don't think he wants to watch Sponge Bob right now. It was Larry. Honey? Oliver didn't do anything. - It was Larry. - Who's Larry? I read about Larry today in that story. Tell me what you saw, please. Larry just wants a friend. He made the lights go out. I could hear him in the house. He moved things. But I couldn't see him. Not really. - So you guys played "Make believe"? - No. He's the one that hurt me. It's not Oliver, Larry. I could feel him, his hands around my neck. He tried to kill me. Larry just wants a friend. Hurry, Oliver, we gotta get to Dad, we can't stay here. Honey, I'm sure it's nothing but better to be safe, right? Can you look at me? We should get going, okay? And no screens! Oliver! What are you talking about? I know it sounds crazy. But I was reading this story about Larry, and then the lights... they started going on and off. And then another one was going on and off. It was like he was using the electricity to move around the room. And then he screwed in all the new light bulbs. So he helped you with your chores? No. He must've needed the power or something to come alive. - Larry? - Larry. I knew I shouldn't have moved out. I am not making this up! Oliver saw him. There is something inside our house. Oliver, here, tell Daddy. He wants me as friend. This thing wants our son. Okay. I think you need a good night sleep. I'll take him to the school in the morning. No, I am not letting him out of our sight. How do we know the school is safe? Okay, well, why don't I bring him to work with me tonight - if he's not going to school tomorrow. - Absolutely not! Come on, you don't trust me with? - No, it's not that, it's... - Rest is important for the body. So you sleep and we can talk about all of this tomorrow. Come on. Let me take care of him. Give this and the change to the gentlemen. There you go. Thanks so much. Have a good one. My man is the pro! Very nicely done. See? Look how good you are at that. You can take over from me some nights. The best part is that in-between cars you can do whatever you want. You can listen to the radio... You can even watch Sponge Bob. Is this the infamous hunted screen? It's okay. Hey, you know how your nightmares aren't real? Well, neither are ghosts or ghouls, or vampires, or witches, and certainly not Larry's. This is Larry. Will you be Larry's friend? He promises to protect you from monsters and from men. Once you take Larry's hand you'll never be alone again. It's nothing. Happens all the time. It's okay. Hang tight. All right. Let's see what we have here. Oliver, what are you doing, buddy? What if a car drove in, huh? You gotta be more careful. Hey. Here. Give me this. Look. Hey. Hey, hey... Buddy, there's nothing... Hey, look at me. There is nothing out there, okay? I'll show you. Look. See? Look at that. See? Totally safe. Oliver! Let him go! Okay. I saw it through that screen. The way he was holding Oliver. Why does he want our son? The story said something about... A true friend is what you lack. He hasn't had a friend since... Oh, yeah, since Jennifer and I got into a fight, I know. Stupid fight. Oliver hit Byron, and then she decided our son was dangerous. Either way he's been lonely long before that. I mean Oliver has been staring at his screens for years. And that... That thing has been staring right back. How come we can't see it, huh? - I don't know. - Doesn't make any sense. How can he be here and not here at the same time? What do you got, honey? That's very nice. We got some kid. Larry's in his word, and we're in ours. But... We're also together. Larry can interact with us but he can't reach us, he can't get to Oliver yet. That why he wants to get into our world. If that's his window... Then we have to destroy it before it becomes his door. We have a cookie. We have a blue car and you get to choose. Whichever one you want. What's it gonna be? Yeah. Good. Marty and I both experienced it, it's not just an Oliver's imagination. I'll be right back, kiddo. Sarah, do you know what a physical empath is? No. It's when you love someone so much that you feel or experience their pain. It's a good sign. It shows just how much you care about Oliver and it's very common in parents. So you're saying that we could be seeing his imagination because we love him? That doesn't make any sense. But an invisible monster that travels through electricity does? We are hoping that that's over now because we destroyed that thing. So does he have a way to communicate? I'll let him take my phone with him to school until we can afford a new one. Unless you could get him talking first. Sarah. Come on, it's... It's extremely rare for kids his age to start verbalizing in a way I fear you're imagining. I know. I know. I just... I just wanna make sure that you still have the right expectations. If he can say a few words, maybe a sentence here and there that would be a big win. We have to keep remembering his strengths. Have you seen him again? What's this? He gave it to me. Seriously? Yes. Then Mom and Dad broke him. Broke him? So like he's gone now? Yes. Can I ask you something? Yes. Why did you stop being my friend? We used to hang out all of the time. I did bad thing. You did? Punch face. Your Mom mad. I barely even had a bruise. The next day I was asking my Mom when we get up another sleepover but she played me a message from your Mom. You Mom said you didn't wanna be my friend anymore. That is lie. Wait, so you never said that? Lie. Wrong. I never. Lie. You are so weird. What are you watching over there? Wait, let me guess. Sponge Bob? No! When he crawls into your world he'll quickly take a friend. For Larry will only have a little time before he flickers again. Larry will not stop until he has a new friend. If someone dares to get in his way they'll surely face their end. Help! Hello?! Somebody help! Where are you? You need any help with your homework? I talked to Jennifer today. She said Byron's doing much better. Hello? How? We found him in his car on the side of the road. We're not sure how it happened, he was unresponsive. We rushed him to the hospital... Hello? Did you turn it on? He will follow you until you finish the story. Why are you doing this to us? Where did you come from? World only look at screens not each other. What does that mean? People very lonely. All that loneliness in world made Larry Larry made of loneliness. Larry is lonely? How do you think I would feel if Larry took Oliver? Finish the story. Finish the story. No! No! No! If you feel broken, sad, or odd Larry likes you even so. No. Stop! Stop. When your hand meets his... Larry can never let go. The End. No! Can you just be normal for one second? Oliver? Oliver, I didn't mean it. Honey. Sometimes even Moms and Dads say things that they shouldn't. I just... Your Dad. He's been in an accident. And they are trying to wake him up. Something happened to him and I think it was Larry. And I cannot let Larry get us, too. Oh my God. We're gonna go for the door. Stay quiet. Oliver, if something happens to us I don't want you to think that I meant what I said downstairs. You lies. What did I lie about? Byron? Honey, you hit him out of nowhere. I thought it would be easier for everyone if I just cut ties. You took away friend. Now I go with Larry. No. No. Don't go with Larry. You're right. I did lie. And I didn't do it... Honey, I didn't do it to protect you. I did it to protect me. Oliver. Can you look at me, please? Please, can you look at me? It's okay. I know you're listening. You're always listening. Much more than I listen to you. Oliver. Oliver. I'm waiting, friend. Come to Larry. Friend. Field. Field. Why the field? Come on! Go! There's no electricity here. He can't get us. You did! You did it! You saved us! Run! Come on! Run! Oliver! Over here! Oliver! Friends. I'll be your friend, Larry. We both want the same thing. We both wanna protect Oliver. I love you. I love all of you. Mom! Mom! No! Good. Now you wanna give it a try? "Mom", excellent. loves me. Wonderful. Mom loves me. I know for a fact your Mom loved you very much. You're so good with him. So are you. How is he doing at home? He seems okay. We've been trying to give him more social experiences like you said. And we've been practicing a speech, like... five times a day? Well, you don't wanna wear him out. - Let's say three times a day. - Okay. Got it. Three times a day for speech work. You know our Sarah, she was... incredible. I thought I understood, but I... I just wish I could tell her that I'm sorry. That I'm trying now. I'm sure she'd like to hear that. I hope they'll find her. Is that you? Hey. Hey. Can I eat lunch with you guys tomorrow or something? That depends. Are you willing to take the pledge? What pledge? A secret handshake. For those of us who's seen Larry. The pledge to stay friends. To play together forever, so no one has to be alone like Larry. I'll protect you.
