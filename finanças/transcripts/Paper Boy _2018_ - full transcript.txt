Grandpa, say a word about Megha She isn’t my granddaughter, but my mom. Grandma, you... I was to die long back, but am still here as she became a Doctor Uncle, what do you say as a father? She’s my luck dear, I developed after she’s born Aunt, you... She’s our 20 year long emotion Children.... -She’s a demon, a rowdy... -She eats up all our chocolates I will be with you for the rest of my life. Megha, Dear Megha! Why are you all dull like this? She didn’t eat anything because of the engagement pressure I think she felt weak because of that. No, she didn’t become weak. What? What are you saying? Yes, she can’t be with us for long What’s this? It’s a rare genetical disorder. Medically, this is called spingohybrosys We even fixed the marriage soon. And now all this happened. How..? How can I say this? I don't understand how can I say this to her Being a Doctor, she can understand this. First you understand, that's enough. Listen You too will die. This chitra will also die. That Sarada will also die. See... that smiling girl, she too will die. These trees will die and I will die also But... I will die a bit before. That's it. Mom, Why haven’t you still lit up the lamp? He gives 3 days lifetime to flowers with life and 1000 years to the lifeless stones. What to light the lamp to him dear? If everything had gone well, today you would've been married. God has already made invitation card ready for me, uncle But, we were foolish to plan my wedding. But still I’m very lucky comparing with many others, dad So many girls are dying right in the womb. Some are being killed after they are born. And some more are dying even without knowing why they are dying. Comparing with all this, I lived for 22 years Being a girl, all this is bonus for me dad. You gave me the best of everything from childhood. Best school, best college, best clothes and best family For my death to be the best now, You all should be smiling. Live Long! Dear, what did you pray God for? Leave it Priest Sir. God isn’t caring even about those praying for 365 days long I don’t have so much belief on him. What did you wish for? Did you ask for 100 years like he blessed? No dear, taking me in half way right? Why was I even born? I asked him to give me one reason I asked to say the meaning for my life Hmm? Yes! - They say after taking birth, a human should at least plant one tree. It gives shades to a few after we leave. I haven’t even done that at least. My worry is not to be knowing the purpose of this birth What are you saying purpose and all? You know what happened at my uncle’s house last week, right? Their kid died as and when was born They are still into mourning. Then what’s the purpose of that kid’s life? How were they before they had their kid? They thought of separating Now, they are together right? Purpose of the kid was to bring them together. Similarly, there should be a purpose for my life too. Baby. - Yes Here, take this bindi of Hanuman. Everything will be fine. What good? - There's negativity in your looks. There’s a difference right in the way he looks at all Don’t bother about her words. Thank you! Be Happy! Sri Anjaneyam, Prasananjaneyam Dharani, The first ever poetry I read are these alphabets. What's this? Looks like a paper from some diary. Excuse me! Can you please give me those papers? I saw her alphabets even before seeing her, I met her feelings even before meeting her, she was the moon for our Sainikpuri. Lines look interesting. - Yes! Can I take this diary? - Thank you You think it is correct to read the diary? He gave us the permission. Come. My name is Ravi. I'm a Paper Boy!

Grandma asked me not to sit up. - Make her sit on your head. She is maid's daughter. She's a kid, Grandma! What mother-in-law, for every small thing. Yes, I'll die soon, why should I care about all these things? It's all a lie, Grandma is saying this since my childhood. Hey, you stay calm. Hi Ravi - Hi sir. Where did you get these old books from? Some guy was selling these to the scrap buyer on road, I saw and bought them. If they are here all our colony people can read along with us You did a very good job. You know, in a way you are helping me. What's in a help sir. Anybody who has hands can do it. But to convert own house into library and do service, one should have a good heart like you. You are so right. - I'll see you in the evening, Sir. - Ok, carry on. Hi Dharani, How are you? - Hi Uncle, I'm good. - Hi Uncle, See I too have come. Fine, books you wanted are out there. Yay, food books . - She is always into food craze All these looks like old collection. Where did you get them from, Uncle? Just now a boy donated and left. Strange! Do boys these days have book reading habit too? You know what? He's exactly like you. He stops seeing an alphabet. Then I must meet him once. Uncle, I'll read Tilak’s Amrutham Kurisina Ratri book once again Sure, enter in this book and take it home dear. - Ok Uncle. Amrutham Kurisina Ratri. Has he written anything like Varsham kurisina ratri? Will you read it? - No. That's why he didn't write. We would walk happily. What is the need of going on the bike in the same colony. What can I do? As per my horoscope, there is risk for me by walking. Oh no.. Forgive me and move on. Hey, see those Bananas! They are inviting me to eat them. You shouldn't eat when your eyes get hungry, but you should eat when your stomach is hungry. Oh good, let's send this as a whatsapp message to all the friends. Hello - Madam Give me one dozen. - Parcel madam? To eat, parcel will be brought by my father These are Rs.100, Madam. My father is a food inspector. Oh no, you eat madam. Madam, bill. Why should I give you the payment? How many times should I tell you not to put the pamphlets in the news paper? We save some money by putting those pamphlets What do we get distributing just the papers? So? You want my husband to slip and fall down in the washroom? Take the paper if you like it or else I'll stop giving it. Who asked him to read the newspaper in the bathroom. Good morning Dad... Good Morning Nani... Good Morning Why did you guys give her the paper early in the morning? See how she's scribbling all over the paper. Ok dear, I'm going. Mom. - Yes Hey Buddi, ask me if you need any paper for playing. Don't spoil the paper which dad reads. That's why, I say keep these maid's at a distance. I did not play with that paper, Sister. - Tell me the truth. - Really sister, Promise on Grandma. Why promising on me? Rascal I'm already ready to die very soon. You... Your ears need to be twisted. Everybody get into the house. I like this Dharani very much. - Is it about me? She's five and a half feet tradition, Fifty kilos of Tradition girl is her. The Telugu word which 56 alphabets feel proud is Dharani. A rainbow flourished 3.5 KM away from my house. That’s why I’m daily going to this house at 5:30 and wish good morning That beauty who returned from the hostel has brought beauty to our total colony. Who knows about me? Who would it be? Hey, Paper boy. What Madam? I want to ask you the same question. What is this? I'm asking you! - I'm sorry Madam. Actually, it’s a habit for me to underline anything I like in the books. I wanted to tell you that you're beautiful. What? I felt my stature isn’t enough and thus expressed it like this by underlining words. Ohh Will the other person understand if you underline and express it like this? Oh no.. - Still, Do I look like a girl who keeps newspaper in front of her as soon as she wakes up. Oh no.. - What if my dad gets to know about this matter? Mam. Really sorry mam. I'll see that it won't repeat again. And do you get money putting pamphlets? Yes madam. Ok then, give us the pamphlets from tomorrow. I think it is uncomfortable for you. - It's ok. Ok Madam. Hello, Paper boy, what's your name? Ravi, madam. Ravi, your hobby is very good, continue doing that. Drizzled as a rain drop, dazzled as lightening She blossomed as tenderness, did some magic She hurt the heart, she made me drown. Her looks have become the snow Her smile is beautiful Her steps have become a river that flowed and dipped me in. Her talks became Telugu. Her call became the light. Her name became the poetry. Her response became the future. She became my world. She drowned me drown Dude, 4 special tea No, Boost for me. - Ok. You sound as excited as one would be if whatsapp works without wi-fi By any chance, did Dharani speak to you? Not just talking dude, we get extra money by adding pamphlets to the newspapers, right? She said continue giving us the pamphlets from tomorrow. Oh no, she might have said that with pity on you and not love. You foul mouthed rascal Hey Pathanjali, she said something with some feel, right? That's enough for me. Your's is just a coffee party dude, I'll give a cocktail party tonight. Keep waiting Cocktail party? But why? I give newspaper to Anitha's family, right? - Yes. Instead of pamphlets in that, I kept a love letter. Oh you blackie fellow Today she'll read that letter and become my slave, and you all can be slaves to my drink. What? for the quarter you give? My darling is in fruit diet only for me What's this? All is well, all is well. She smiled I'll reply. She's writing something She's written something guys, catch! Yes, nobody saw it. I’ll make my love success before all of you. You call me blackie I'll make tears roll out from your eyes. Hey god Enough of seeing the paper, open it now. Do you have the guts to see it and stay strong? You first open it Be careful you might get a heart-attack. Hold the hands and open it guys. - Leave me guys, this is my personal. Oh, she's in her fruit diet. - Hahaha Hey don't get shocked. She showed you how waste is your love. Here, keep smelling it. Yeah dad, suddenly car is not working. I'll go in a cab I'll share the location, send the mechanic. - Ok dear. Be careful Oh shit, battery dead... Dharani madam. - Hey, paperboy What's this? Morning paper, auto in the afternoon and is it valet parking in the evening? Nothing as such madam, My dad isn't feeling well today and so I'm riding his auto. What happened to your car? Any repair? I need to go to the Medchal Registar office urgently. Come, I'll drop you Is it ok to go so far in an auto? For you anything is fine, madam. Come and sit. - Ok - 1 second. Dad, your fever is favoring me so much. Ravi - Yes Ravi, please stop at any flower bouquet shop on the way. - Ok madam But why are you going alone to the register office madam? It's my friend's wedding. - Ohh Is it love marriage? - Yes, they were my classmates at IIT Kharagpur Girl is a Keralite and the boy is from Hyderabad. That boy is so lucky, his love story became success. Keep asking someone for 4 years,even your love will be success. Ohh, the shop is closed. What should we do now? No problem, we'll go ahead and try. What happened to this suddenly? When luck got into the auto, why’s bad luck coming over on me? You... Please start. What happened? I think my bad time spread to your vehicle. I’ll go in another auto Bye. No, wait madam 1 minute Shall we go on a bike? How can you get the bike as of now? - 1 minute Ganesh bro, Hello Hello brother, are you fine? I'm fine bro. I need a small help brother. - Tell me Ravi I need your bike for an hour - Take it bro. You deliver us the paper in sun and rain. Why will I not give you my bike. Take it. Thanks brother. I asked you to take me to a bouquet shop, why did you bring me to a nursery, Ravi? - 2 minutes Hi sister. - What Ravi, how come you are here? Is your mom wishing to grow even flower plants along with vegetables? Nothing like that sister Sister, she's my friend. We need some flowers urgently. Take whatever you want brother, the whole nursery is yours. - Thanks akka. What kiddo? What are you doing here with out going to the school. Here's your bouquet Wow Ravi, it's amazing, better than the original one. Ravi, instead of different flowers growing to the different trees, it would be great if all the flowers grow to the same tree, right? Then every plant becomes a beautiful bouquet. Oh come on let's go. We are getting late. Bye aunty, Thank you so much! Bye sister I'll see you. - Ok Ravi Dharani is here. Come, come Hi guys. - Why so late Dharani? That's a big story, I'll explain it to you later. First meet Mr Ravi. - Hi - Hi Bro Looks like none of our friends are here All gave it a miss, including Sandeep who should sign as a witness. Looks like you got him to sign as the witness. Please come bro. It's ok. Come Come soon dear. I'm a sugar patient and getting late for lunch. Sorry sir. Exchange the garlands Congrats guys. - Thank you Please sign the papers. Sign it Ravi What's wrong Ravi? I'm sorry. Marriage with no parents and I doing the witness sign without knowing them I somehow don't like this. Don't take me wrong brother Marriage isn't about garlands and signatures like this. It's about families and memories. Those memories should be remembered forever Even we too feel the same, but what can we do when parents don't agree I heard it took 4 years for you to make her accept your love And how many years did you try to make your family accept your love? 4 month or 4 days? Or atleast 4 hours? You would've asked them 4 times, when they said no you got tensed and took this decision. Parents always gave us everything that we like in our childhood, and they will give us the partner whom we like But we need to patiently talk to them about our love. Ok Sir, I think you have no patience. Dharani madam gave respect to your decision and I give respect to Dharani mam. No Ravi. I want to give respect to your words than to our decision. Yes bro, Our marriage will happen with our families consent. I have seen so many boys in my service, but did not meet anyone who has such good manners dear. Dharani, How can you read the book while listening to music. We need a background score while watching a movie, right? For me this is like that. Enough of reading this. You too read as if you're preparing for exams, just like your dad. Hello, say Sambu! Oh it's your daughter's wedding. Congratulations friend! Who is the guy? - Mom, did you like dad as soon as you saw him? I didn't even know his face clearly till one year of our marriage. That means, you married him without any feelings? Actually, after your elder brother was born, I got real feelings for him. And that increased with the age. Maybe I had the feelings inside me, but it took time for me to realise. That's it. Ok ok. Sleep now. - Ok Good night mom. - Good night There was no feeling when I saw you and met you and got to know you. There was no feeling when I walked with you, spoke to you or answered when you called me. When my heart didn't ask me who are you when I first met you, why is it asking me now. Why do I have this feeling now, which never happened before. I think I'm in love with you... Hey Ravi, Hi. - Dharani madam you Hi madam, - You give news paper here? No madam, - Then, did you come here to collect bill? No madam. I came here to attend the interview, but I lost it What is your qualification exactly? I did my B-tech mam. - B-tech? Seriously? Ya You did B-tech but distributing papers? Oh, that's for living. This is for future. You lit my heart everyday morning. I've been waiting for this morning since last night. My birth just started with you, I don't remember what all happened in my past. What's there in these lines and fate? Our thoughts will turn into relations. What’s going to happen in this trance and magic? Who would let us know all about this? I think I'm in love with you. Your thought grew in me like a plant. My thoughts for you crossed all the directions. I turn into a toy when I'm with you Will you make me walk just like my mother? A day should complete it's day and night You and I should be together to complete one life Our doubts should be cleared for us to come along. But when will our doubts get cleared? I think I'm in love with you... Ok man, I'll leave, need to distribute the cards to many people. Ok dude. - Don't forget to get Dharani along with you for the wedding. Sure. She's here, you only tell her directly. Hi Sambu uncle. - Hi Dharani Hi Geetha. - Hi - Congrats for the marriage...Thank you Dear Dharani, you should stay back at our office from Sangeet to the Wedding. - Ok uncle. Ok dude. - Bye see you man. Bye dear.. Bye uncle. Hey bibliophile Hey! - You said you went out for my birthday shopping, what did you buy? We don't have that much range to buy. Dharani gifted me this dress. What? Dharani gifted you this? Let us see. It is so good. Hey dude, from our colony's tailor you grew up to Tommy Hilfiger range. Hey, you admired by seeing the alphabets, You waited for 5 years liking the ideology, She gave you the phone, she gifted you this dress, when will you tell her your feelings? What are you saying? Are you in love with that paper boy? Yes, he might be poor financially, but in character he is the richest among all the guys I know. When did you connect with him so much? This looks very close to my ideology. Uncle - Say dear This is a new book right? Who took it who took it so fast? Oh that book? Paper boy Ravi took it. Paper boy Ravi? They say worlds of no two in this world are same. But after seeing those alphabets, I felt our worlds are same. After that one day in a journey, I understood what his value is and what his values are That's it, I decided to share my life with him Really? But when are you telling this to him? Day after tomorrow it's her friend Poorna birthday. I'm thinking of to express my love to her in that party. All the arrangements are great. Right baby? - Yeah That buffet too. Hey, that food inspector irritated us so much so many times This is the right time to take our revenge. That’s why I put huge bowls and small spoons. I mixed whitewash in rice and colors in curries Super... If possible, mix a motion tablet in his soup. Darling, shall we cut the cake? 2 minutes dad, one important friend should come. - Who is that? Where is he? What Sarpam? - Where is the party going on? Oh god, even marriages at our house will not happen like this. Really? - By the way, did you talk to Dharani? I feel bit tensed to say it to her. It would've been great if you guys were here with me. How can we come without that fat girl inviting us? You first go talk to Dharani. Be strong. Ok,hang the phone There he is! Hi... Come, come, come Huh? this fellow? When you said someone important is coming, I expected a president range. Is it our paper boy? Oh no.. my foot. Come! Thanks for coming. - Happy Birthday mam. You look very handsome in this dress, Ravi. You bought it right? Friends, I know all of you are waiting for the cocktail But, We can only catch you for birthday parties like this. So, I want to tell you few words. Attractions and love at this age is common. As a food inspector, I would like to say one thing to all of you, Either it is food or love, having quality control is very important. Don't fall in love with anybody and everybody. Check what’s their sanitation, what’s their adulteration and what’s their contamination? Only then food will get digested, and love becomes a huge success. Thank you....Thank you... Come darling, let's cut the cake. - Ok dad. Happy birthday to you... Happy Birthday Poorna Happy Birthday Poorna. What Poorna, did you fall in love? Your dad was giving lectures on love? I know nothing about love than just food Aarav, what is love exactly? - It means love to change. That's for guys like you. Ravi you tell us about love. Love is like Oxygen. It's invisible but gives life. Wow, nice. By the way, you didn't introduce him to us. He's Ravi, my boy friend. Hi, this is Ishani. - Hi. Hi, I'm Aarav. - Hello Hi, this is Teja. - Hi Brother. So, let's do a quality control test on your boy friend. Ok. - What do you do? He's a software engineer. - Oh nice. What's your CTC bro? - 12... 12 per annum. Which company are you in? IBM Wow, Congrats! Dharani, you are very lucky! That is... 1 minute, I'll be back Ravi Why are you leaving in the middle, Ravi? When we know that we can't walk till the end, It is better to leave in the middle. Are you angry at me that I lied to them? No. I felt sad for hiding the truth. I didn't love you because you are some Gadwal Reddy's daughter, Dharani. I loved your thoughts and feelings before even seeing you directly. You are a very good girl, Dharani I mean, I tried a lot to see you and talk to you in the starting Dharani, but I somehow couldn't. But you, yourself made friends with me. It costs around Rs.300 for me if I have Tea for one whole month, Dharani. You took me somewhere, what was that place? Starbucks. One cup is Rs.300. Is it madness or craze? It costs Rs.50 to cut my hair in our street. And Rs.1000 at the Cucoon you took me Then, I thought only in prices. Now, I see the difference even in persons. Ravi, Let me explain why did I tell them all that You'll have your own reasons, Dharani You came close to me only after you got to know that I'm educated and did B-tech. But I didn't notice it. Correct. I felt so glad when you gifted me a phone. Standard! Yes I couldn't understand. When you bought me this shirt and asked me to come by tucking in it, I felt it is true love, Dharani. You prepared me for the presentation? What nonsense, Ravi? Are you mad? Dharani. The point to feel bad here is, like everybody you too thought that distributing paper is low but it is not wrong. Your range is different, Dharani Just look at your background. See how bright and how great it is And behind me, it's all darkness. Don’t leave that Brightness and come into this darkness Dharani Ravi, do you understand what are you talking? Yeah Dharani, I understand I thought I am the Shahjahan to the Taj Mahal I built Am I just the labor? Ravi... Come, Sit Let's go home and read Megha. Mom already called 3 times. Let's go after reading. Hey, can't you hear your phone is ringing Hey leave it dude, might be some fans Oh, you also have fans Blackie? Not just to those who come in paper, but people who distribute papers also have fans. It is not fan or AC. Someone named Appu. - You want me to lift? Hey, No no Appu is the guy who is lending me money, if you lift I'm gone. Dude, why are you like that? Nothing dude. No man, something is wrong. It seems he's not delivering the newspapers correctly. I heard people taking at the paper shop that there are few complaints on him. What happens if paper changes, news will remain the same in everything. Right? Will they complain for this silly thing. You shut up Idiot. We are not talking about them, we are worried about our friend. My mood isn't good, leave me! What's with mood dude, have few pegs in the evening, everything will be fine. Not by drinking but I thought I'd get some clarity by talking. So I went to meet Poorna. What? Did you come to collect your bill? Wait I'll get it. Poorna Madam... I tried calling Dharani so many times, but she isn't picking it up. Can you please... Huh! If it was me I would've blocked your number. I did a mistake mam. - You didn't understand that until you mad her cry? She understood what you are just by travelling 1 day with you. But you couldn't understand her after knowing her for so many days. Sorry madam. Very sorry! I felt what happened was a incident, but couldn't understand her intention. Later when I gave it a thought, I felt bad about what I said. Ravi, she is the one who hypes your respect but not the one damaging it. Not in the books, instead come out and see how girls these days are. They are having multiple options in hand. Remember one thing, Girls like Dharani cannot be found all over the earth. I want to meet Dharani immediately. - She is not here, she's gone to Alleppey for her friend's wedding. Story of you and me I'm crazy for you Let me have so many dreams with you and let them all come true. Diwali started because of you... Diwali of heart. Diwali started because of you... Diwali of heart. Very very sorry, Dharani. How many more times will you say. You know why do we have gap between fingers? No Life partner we get will fill it. Let's not leave these hands forever. This gap should never come between us ever again. What's this Ravi? Kissing is not exchanging lips, but exchanging the breath. That blue sky is our roof, river bank is our café Fruits of the tree are our buffet... Life is very new... Cool breeze plays the band and sound from the hills is DJ. The crops did the dance...The rivers gave the claps In eyes gallery, we are hiding our dreams. Let’s forget future and mix up in nature... Diwali started because of you...Diwali of heart. Diwali started because of you... Diwali of heart. The branches and twigs on the way is the green umbrella Her beautiful life has no scars. Moonlight in the rivers and the humidity in the air and the love in heart cannot be separated Rejoicing within, mixing up with us, time introduce itself to us Diwali started because of you... Diwali of heart. Diwali started because of you... Diwali of heart. I'll finalise today. What Sarpam? What do you need? You have no slippers on your feet, right? No dude, this is business time. Let me know what do you want fast. You foolish Anitha, either you throw the peels or the trash I want to say one thing straight, I love you. We'll get married if you say yes. We'll be the best pair after Naga Chaitanya and Samantha. What do you say? Oh no, why is she folding? I'm also saying it straight forward, I've no intention to marry Even I have the same feeling. Marriage my foot. Let's not follow the trend, let's set it. Let’s take a room in old city and live-in together. Let's not give up even when we are tired. If needed, after getting bored in 6 months, let's break up and go back to our own houses. What say dear? I said I don't want marriage with you Rascal. If you repeat all this drama ever again, I'll chop you down and throw it in the stove. He is not lifting my call, Mom. Please try once again. - Ok Your dad never stay outside without informing. - Don't worry mom We're so tensed at home, can't you just call and inform What happened dad? Why are you like that dad? What happened? You know Sambasiva Rao uncle, right? What happened to him? He recently gave us his daughter's wedding invitation. Nothing happened to him. His daughter Geetha died by suicide. Oh no... Marriage is in a week, why did she do this dad? Even today in office, he said his daughter is leaving to London in a week, he said he'll also be going to London for the next summer holidays. But all this happened by evening. Why did that crazy girl take such a big step? Love... It seems she liked someone but did not tell this at home with fear. Meanwhile marriage approached near, that's it. But, why are all the kids in your generation like this baby? You tell us every small thing at home, Why do you hide such a big matter? They might scold or beat but will not kill you people, right? They will agree with the love they have on their kids if explained in a right way. Then please agree, dad Hey, what are you talking? Yes mom, I'm in love with a boy Who dear? The one who delivers news paper to our home. Paper boy? I expected... I expected something like this will happen when I always saw him around our house. What are you thinking dad? Geetha might have thought that even when kids have the freedom to say about their love, Parents will not have the courage to agree dad. It's 2 in the midnight, you and mom in your room and I alone in my room, What's the difference between our house and Sambasiva Rao uncle's house dad? Only thing is there Geetha is not there, I'm here! That's all. You liked a paperboy... When we used to visit Gadwal for festival, you used to say all the lands visible were ours, Can you at least identify those with your eye sight now? How much ever we have, that is not important dad But who's beside us is important They say a girl should have father in front of her, brother behind her and husband beside her, dad. Though he is a paperboy, he studied engineering, he is taking care of the house. He knows the responsibilities dad Future will be good. Ok dear. Let's invite them to our house one day. Thank you dad. Thank you so much! I'm afraid son. - Nothing to worry mom, come Greetings. - Greetings How are you? - Fine sir. Dear, send away that auto man and come. He is my father sir. When son is a paperboy, what else can a father be than auto driver? Why should I even care? - Mother in law Oh I'm sorry. Please don't take me wrong. Please come in. - It's ok sir. - Please! Please sit uncle. Please sit. Oh no, what is that? Please sit up. Do you feel any dis comfort? Think this as our house, and feel free. It's ok Sir. Down... Come on sit in the sofa. Please tell them dear. Sit... Please. Sir, I'm just a auto driver who can come till your gate and my son an ordinary paperboy who can come till your door. My wife is a cook and can come till your kitchen. But you called us to your home, made us sit with you and talking with us so respectfully... What's there in that? My house has just 2 rooms and 4 walls more than your house. But when we got to know that our daughter loved a paper boy we got a bit upset. But when my daughter spoke to us we understood... Boys will only love when they like and girls will love only when they trust. That's why we took this decision No no, sit. - Please have it.. Please take it son. - Thanks madam Mother-in-law. You gave them coffee in silver glass, see that they don't rob it. We have 3 children. What I earned will be given to 3 of them equally. You want to know anything else, you can ask me. No sir, you are giving us your darling daughter whom you raised for 20 years. What else do we need? Send her to our home, we'll take care of her preciously. Both my sons stay in the USA. We'll look for a good day, call them here and have the engagement. Very happy sir. Now we'll leave sir. - See you Greetings. - Greetings. If all the rich people think like you, it will be so good madam. What's good? Anybody riding a cycle will wish to ride a car, but these people are making a girl who goes by car sit on a cycle. You go inside. I might die anytime soon. Why should I care? Let my grand sons come down, I'll talk. What's this new dress? Are you tensed that your son might fall for me, Aunty? Don't worry! I won't fall so easily. Why are you so tensed dear? They will agree for sure. Don't worry! There they come. Hi... - Hi brother. Daddy... - How are you? Hey... - Hi brother. Hi dad...

Why did you make him like this, guys? - Let's go mom. Shall we leave now Son? - Let's go Hi. I'm Poorna, Annapurna I'm Satti, Annavaram Satti. Hey, there's rice in your name itself. That's why I became a chef. I like food very much. I like laddoo so much I eat so much. - I cook great Pleasure meeting you. - Pleasure is all mine. The worlds of these two souls have found their mates. The footsteps of this duo have found their pair. They are different from the rest of the world...but identical with each other. Being together, they are dreaming alike. What's wrong, Son? What's this dad? How did you accept that match? No son... - Mom you don't talk. Tell them like that seriously. Is that the house where Gadwal Reddy's daughter will go after marriage? Mother-in-law... Why are you crying now after doing all this? That is, I really... - Loved him? Tell me. Did you love him? Yeah Then, marry him dear... Hey, hey, hey... You got frightened, right? You thought only you can give us surprises? See, we gave you shock. Is it really ok for you brother? 100% cool dear. Dharu, to which house you're going is not important. To whose life you're going into is important. What if he is a paperboy? Thanks brother. Thanks ra. I was so tensed that you guys won't like my decision. Chill dad. You always take right decisions. Come on, freshen up and eat something. Hey come! You wait madam, don't take the trouble. I'll say the dubbing for you. I might die anytime soon. Why should I care? That's it, right madam? What Dharani, Really? Yeah, that's true! they're really impressed. I'm so happy Ravi.

All this is for Sister. Let's do a mistake, for sister. Do you even understand what you're saying? Do you understand what you're doing? What is this? What the hell is this? Why didn't you give the gifts to your brother in law you brought from US? Will this watch match him? Can he carry these shoes? If you give him this Armani suit, he's gonna keep it inside his shelf till his death. If you give him this I-Phone, he’d feel it would be better if you've gifted him an auto I'm getting frustrated just by listening to the word, Paperboy. Though her name is Dharani, she's been brought up like a princess. How can we give her to him? Hey, I was born before you, That pain, anger and that irritation, I have more than you. You were thinking what to do and I was thinking how to do. Let's do it. Let's do something strongly. Very strongly. Hi Aunty... Hi Ravi. Hi. What aunty, I think you love plants a lot. You're growing vegetables at home itself. Yes dear. They grow either we give them dirty water or fresh water. We save little money by growing them at home. Anyone is after your Aunty in saving money. What's wrong uncle? They sell the same vegetables in the name of organic. And they are healthy too. Come in dear, please come. No problem aunty. Please sit dear. I'll go get some tea. You can give her daily after the wedding. Let me talk to her. I'm thinking of to stop distributing paper from tomorrow. Why? Your parents understood our love and agreed for our marriage. And I can't insult them by distributing paper in your colony. Good son, we did not even get this thought. And one small request. Only if you like. Can we do the engagement simple with just few people and not calling too many. Yes dear, none of your people should be insulted because of us. Ok uncle, I'll talk to dad. Heard that the boy is a paper boy? Is he from our caste? Huh, Can't you understand seeing that color? They are that. Get that telecasted in TV... Paper boy it seems. Did we invite you for all this? Sit silently no murmuring. Sir, everybody is here, should I start now? - Can you please wait for 2 mins, my brother in law should come. Hey, walk carefully guys. You shouldn't walk beside me. Idiots. Look, he is here! Sorry sorry. I'm late please forgive me. Sit down man, Sit. Greetings... - Are you good? Congrats dear. - Thank you. Brother in law, Is he the son in law? - Yes He looks smart. Please forgive me as I was late. Priest, please start. Elder have decided that Gadwal Reddy's daughter Dharani and only son of Madasi Narayana, Ravi Will get married on the 4th of next month at 12.01 AM. Both the families, please exchange your offerings. Smile a bit guys. Did you come here for an auspicious event or to a death house? Brother in law. It's not their mistake but yours. You said it is your daughter's engagement, but didn't say about the groom. How many times you've asked me for matches and I've brought so many great matches. But you said no to each and every match. Have you brought any great match than that? You're going to bring a Paperboy as your Son in law. From tomorrow, your daughter and son in law will distribute papers to each house? Will your daughter sell papers? Dharani liked him. Daddy, I like to jump into the well she says. Will you push her? What are you talking, brother in law? Even if you keep the gold in the iron box, gold is gold and an iron box will be an iron box. Will we put an iron chain to our neck saying it is strong? We put that in dog's neck only. But you're saying that you'd like to put it in your neck and you want me to stay calm seeing all this? Uncle! - Yeah, I'm saying all this because I'm your uncle. This is a marriage in Gadwal Reddy's house and I'm asking you to give it a thought. We thought about it and then decided about the wedding, Uncle. Attend the wedding if you like it or skip it if you don't. Many thanks... Why are you crying dear? All this is happening because of me. Look Dharu, we have only one life and we should live it as we like. We are confident that Ravi will take care of you like a queen. Why are you still dull? Call Ravi. Let's all together select the wedding card and then go to Baahubali movie. We missed it in US. You're happy now? - Yeah Sir, let's take baby along with us. - Baby? She'll learn Kilikili language. Come on Dharu, get up and go get ready. I lost 1000 calories by the time we selected your wedding card. Shall we eat anything? Hey, we are going to the film right? You will anyway eat in between. Will the traffic police fine if we eat now? Good punch baby! Thanks baby. Hey Maize...They taste great. You want to eat, baby? - Will you get them, baby? Sir... Sir, talkies is nearby right? I'll buy and come running, you go. Maize for my love... Uncle, how much is the maize? Oh, you don't know english. right? Film is a big hit, right? Cool! Cool man. Hey groundnuts... Oh no, it is a sin if you just see it. It is a sin if you don't eat it. Dharu, it's getting late. They both will come... Let's go - Come on, come on Look man, add equal salt and spice, squeeze lemon and give one packet. She looks like a round vegetable. Make it fast. - She's very round like a Golconda tombs. What the hell did you say? Oh...English medium? Who the hell are you man? Hey... If her accent is so good, how great would that be? Bloody idiots... Hey catch her. Hey, leave me... I'll buy you groundnuts. Will you sleep with me? Baby... Who was that idiot who made my Baby call Baby? - Me dude So... so what? What will you do? Baby, sit. Sit! Butterscotch - Two I know that you can’t sit idle. You keep licking these and I’ll go on kicking them. You sit relaxed and eat. By the time you finish those, I’ll finish them. Come on. What's your buildup man? Excuse me! Don't hit me bro, I'm sick and I just took medicines. You said that you like my baby? Say sorry to baby. Sorry, sorry, sorry... Super baby! Came for a marriage and he fixed his own ...Come let's go. Hey Ravi...I'm saying this before only, I'll buy Dharani's wedding Saree with my one month income. Why are you competing with me? I said I'll take the Saree. Right? Ok, leave it dad...We both will buy one for the reception. Greetings. - Oh sir it's you... Please come in. Hi Uncle. - Please come in. Please come, sit. Why did you come at this time, Sir? We were busy with wedding shopping since morning. Actually daddy asked us to give you this in the morning. What is this sir? - Money. As per our tradition, girl family will give money for groom's family wedding clothes. What's this son? Why are you giving us money? We will buy with whatever we have. It's ok Aunty. Keep it! Don't give us so much burden, we cannot carry it. You're saying this for just 5 lakhs. - Our wealth is going to come to your house in few days. How will you carry her? I'll take care of her like my daughter. Hey we can talk later, first go get some tea. It's almost 10 uncle, why tea at this time? Aunty, serve food if it is available, we did not eat anything since morning because of this shopping. We're very hungry. Wait, I'll prepare dinner in 2 mins. - Aunty, serve us what is available. You won't make specials daily for our sister after marriage. Right? Uncle, water.. What dude, why are you mixing it like that, Aunty cooks in different houses, you think they'll have 4 different curries daily? Come on, eat. What happened? Too spicy? Yeah. They'll add lot of spice so that they don't eat so much of curry. What are you looking for? You shouldn't expect ghee while eating raw spice. Come on, eat. Is the food not going in? - No For me too... Because we are not used to eat such food. But we should get used to it now. After getting married, our sister should also eat the same. Throat is paining when the food is going in through it. Heart is burning. But she has no other way bro. She should eat this life long. She should sleep right here. What are you seeing brother? That there's only one room? For the first night they'll go out and sleep. Are you thinking what after that? They all will sleep together. One couple will turn to one side and the other to onother side. She was born in Apollo Hospitals. - Her kids will be born in that Gandhi Hospital. Our kids will go to Oakridge Her kids will got to the Government school beside that bridge. No problem. Dad has promised her, and we should follow. But Ravi, one thing... You are just a paperboy, If you had a sister and if she loved a guy who picks up papers on the road. Will you think it is ok, they both will pickup papers on the road and get them married. Look Aunty, love is a promise between two couple. But marriage is a journey between two families. In that journey if we come to your house for good or bad, we'll enter with our shoes For now pain is only on one side, but in future it will be on two sides. You work in 4 houses, Invitation of Gadwal Reddy is now in your hands. Ravi, Why this silence between us? Did you understand, Son? We have no answer to any of their questions. He asked us... If he was a guy who picked up papers on road, would you give him? We cannot compare our status with Gadwal Reddy. We should understand their pain, right son? When we had tea at their place, It didn't go down the throat. Today for them, Food didn't go down their throat. We felt very happy thinking you'll have a great life. We never thought that a girl will be loosing her amazing life, Son. If they really are against this wedding, gas may blast at our house, Our Auto might meet with an accident But they didn't do anything like that. They just shed two tears and left. Let us give value to those tears, Son. I felt mom's words were true. I felt there's no status difference between love these days is false. I thought about it that whole night. I wrote in the same alphabets, which made us come together, That I should go away from her forever. Huh, what happened after that. Nothing is written here What might have happened later? Is he mad or what? Why did he think of going away forever. How did this diary which he wrote there, come here? Oh my god! Something has gone wrong. We should know what happened actually We should go to Hyderabad immediately. Hello, Gadwal Reddy's house? Go straight and take left. Aunty... - Who are you dear? Iam Dharani's friend. - Please come in Who are you dear? Dharani's friends itseems. Come dear, sit. I'll go get water. Aunty, we don't need water. Can you please call Dharani? Dharani is not here dear. What happened, Aunty? Her brothers did unnecessary things with unconditional love on her. Because of that she gave us unexpected punishment to us. She left the house. She's not staying with us. Don't cry Aunty. I came here and made you sad. It's ok dear. Pain has become a part of our lives. Where is Dharani now, Aunty? Dharani... Dharani? Yes. You are...?? My name is Megha. I came from Mumbai. If you are here...Ravi? You know Ravi? I know everything about you too... - How? I got to know by reading these words written by Ravi. This is Ravi's diary. Where did you find it? Please come. How did this diary reach Mumbai? What happened to Ravi? What happened that night after your brothers met Ravi at his house? That day was Valentine's day and we decided to meet at 12 in the night. But, Ravi didn't come. I tried calling him, but it was out of reach. I came to know from his friends that he decided to leave everything and everybody permanently. I couldn't believe when I got to know that they died in a train accident. But, Seeing the unidentified bodies, people of this colony believed it. Name of the guy who distributed paper daily was in the papers the next day. I came to know from Satya that my brothers are the reason for them to leave the city. Why did you guys do this? Did dad ask you to give them that money? You tried to kill them by hitting them on their self respect. You cut the throat by being nice to them, brother. It is not like that dear. You did this because you love me? Love is you people liking the guy whom I loved But not sending him away You can only separate us but not our souls. You both did a very big mistake. I will only set that mistake right. The place where I wanted to live with Ravi life long, I'm now living there without him. No, your belief is correct. Nothing would've happened to Ravi. We found the diary means Ravi is alive If something have happened to him, god would never sent me into your lives. There is a meaning to my journey. Trust me. Before my life ends, I'll unite both of you. - Megha, Megha How come you are here? - Get well soon, Megha! I informed Karan. Where did you get these flowers from? I ordered them online and they gave the delivery here. Do you have the address? Yeah, I have it. That's really great! Love you Karan. Hey Megha, No. Did you deliver these flowers to Live Life hospital? Yes mam. Is his name Ravi? No mam. His name is Afzal. I only ordered the flowers, can you let us know from where did you get these from? This order was placed in Mumbai and we got the flowers from Gurgaon. We ordered for the flowers in Hyderabad but they came from Gurgaon And you got this diary in Mumbai I'm unable to crack the link that Ravi has with all this.. We might get some information if we go to Gurgaon office. Bro, will these flowers get delivered to Hyderabad from this address only? Yes mam, we specialize in these kind of flowers. Do you make these right here? No, we get them from Pune. Do you have that address? Yes, why not? - Please give us. I'll give you their card. Thank you! Will the sky show us the way to reach you? My life is standing on the edge of the looks. I got some confidence that all the dreams will come true. What's the way to reach you to make all my words come true? Hey sun ray, ray of hope, let me find my love... Hey sun ray, ray of hope, let me find my love... One step is never ending distance, but now it turned so far. One second is the time of centuries. Brother, Is this Ravi's house? This is not Ravi's house. They supply flowers, right? Yeah, but there is no one with that name here. It's you who can keep me alive, and my foot doesn't stop after listening to that. Hey sun ray, ray of hope, let me find my love... Hey sun ray, ray of hope, let me find my love... Appu... Appu... Stop the car. Appuu... Dharani... Your purpose of bringing Sita and Rama together and my purpose of bringing them together is fulfilled.
