[Theme music] [The sound of the eagle] [In a whisper] Don't!!! Where are they taking us? I don't know Perhaps towards the mountains And then they're gonna kill us? Kill us? What do you mean kill us? Calm down! They are gonna hear us. No one is going to kill anyone. They do it with the injections they gave if they wanted. So what did they inject us with? Going kill us? No, they can't kill us. They are keeping us hostage. I think we are being taken to prison camp. It was the camp. They would be returning. They took us from the village to take us towards mountains. Don't you see? Why the mountains? We learn that soon enough. How much do you think this bullet costs? One or two dollars maybe a bit cheaper. Why do you ask? So that's how much a man's life's costs? One or two dollars! You got the cost of human life after killing so many. So it's correct to say the more there is of something the cheaper it becomes huh ? There are a lot of bullets hence it is cheap. Humans also lose value as they populate $2 huh $2! That was a weird line of conversation. Listen if the cap her dead it would kill you with his own hands and with his gun with his $5 bullets. [Laughing] Hey! Hey! What happened to you? You okay? All good. I'm fine. Leave me alone. [The sound of the eagle] Listen, we can make it out. Are you kidding me? They have guns we've got nothing! They'd shoot us dead! Please tell me how can you stay so calm like this? What do you mean? Like that, calm. Look at me! I'm afraid more than you are, but I do not show it! Whatever. Listen, if he attack at the same time we could get our hands on some of their weapons. This might be our only chance. We have nothing to lose anyway. Even if we die we won't die as cowards huh? What do you say huh? Hey, are you with me? Yes, yes. Good, wait for my signal when they drop us. We can get them if we attack together. We have the numbers this could be our last chance. They are numbers are less than us. This could be our last chance. If you succeed. Okay, what about the other truck? They would join us. What if they don't Arvin? We've got no other option! No! No! No! I'm begging you! [Truck honking] [Intense music] I'm begging you! Son come back! No! [She's crying] They'll shoot him! Shut up! No! Don't shoot! [Man hums the song] Don't shoot! No! Don't shoot! Good idea.

It's okey. They could live too... [Death rattle] Yes they had a chance to survive. I'm letting you guys be... You wouldn't be here if we didn't need you. Nobody's going to follow you, I promise. [Laughing] Don't look at me as if you hate me. I could kill you right here. But as you see I'm giving you a chance. You should be grateful, I am being generous here. Now go, shoo! Come on, let's go.

[Something falls] Hold me tight. [Death rattle] I'm made it! I'm here! They'll kill us. Will find us. No. Ah! [Gunshots] No! [Inhales with pain] [Gunshot] [Small stones falling] [They are silently waiting] [Water splash] [In a whisper] Ejla, Ejla. [Silence] We are leaving! [Silence] They work very hard to survive. They didn't make. They waited for a miracle that didn't happen. And that's the result. [Laughing] [Radio tone] From headquarter the fifty-five. We got it handled it. From headquarter the fifty-five. Fifty-five copies. [Radio tone] You need to bring to captive. They says it's important. There is something wrong. They are no more. [Radio tone] Damn it! Check again.

Come, come here. [Theme music] He saw us hide. That's why he came towards us But he didn't make it. I know He couldn't see. He told me. He couldn't see. When I got him. He wouldn't make it anyway. He lost lot of blood. where did you think this place is? What's on the other side? do you think there is away out? It looks like a stream made this hole. or maybe it's man made. Looks like deep marks there Top part of the soil is soft, but down side is very very tough. Looks like it wouldn't be easy to get out, but I think we need to try anyway. No, no. I'm begging you, Not today. Okey, calm down. Just rest. [Silence of night] [Intense music] [Scary scream] Ron! Why didn't you help me? Why did you let them shot me? They will learn, you are here.

[sound of something moving in the bushes] Shh! Its here because of the smell for food. Let's be quiet. They might attack us. [Small stones falling] I told you they were animals. But there are corpses Yes. They are eating them They feast with human meat. They will feel full for tonight they will enjoy for few days Don't say that. It doesn't matter what I say. That's reality. [Water splash] Lighting a fire will give our position away Why did they get down here? Just to opposite. Animals fear fire. Fire is our only weapon against them. [Theme music] How is your wound? Does it hurt? It's bleeding a little but it doesn't hurt. [Theme music] [Night bird crowing] [Silence] [Theme music] How do we get out of here? How are you? Does it hurt? A little but it'll get infected if we don't get out of here. We will with the help of this tree. All these trees won't help us. They look dry and weak. I know, but I think at least we need to try tho. I will tie them together and throw it up there. And then? Then we will tie our clothes together and climb. Ä°f you're sure? No. I'm not. [Theme music] [Water splash] Why are you wetting the clothes? They will be more durable when they are wet [Sound of wind] [Theme music] What do you think we should expect? I think... I think a biggest threat is to stay here. [Theme music] Hold it. [Sound of wind] Stay a side. [Theme music] [Small stones falling] [Theme music] [Small stones falling] [Theme music] [Small stones falling] [Theme music] [Small stones falling] Arvin, can I go first?

Let me see. Ah! Ah! Why is everything going wrong? Let me bring you some water. [Moan in pain] Ah! Ah! I almost made it. Ah! [Moan in pain] Ah! We need to get out otherwise. This will be our grave. Ah Okey, press the wound. [Moan in pain] [Theme music] Take this and wear it. Don't let your wound get infected. Ah! Ah! We have got nothing to eat. We could maybe survive taste to this water for a few days. We didn't die to bullets, but we will starve to death. [Laughing] The end is the same. Which one would you prefer an easy death with a bullet or here starving to... starving to death? Slowly [Moan in pain] Hunger brings the philosopher out in you. Who get out of here? I know we will so... so do I. [Moan in pain] [Moan in pain] [Moan in pain] [Moan in pain] [Moan in pain] [Raindrop falling] [Laughing] What happened? Why are you laughing? ...

[Flowing water] [Thunder] [Flowing water] Don't be afraid. I don't think this rain will last long it will stop soon what if it doesnt It will. Come. [Flowing water] [Thunder] If rain doesn't stop, we will drown. even if it rains a little. wells will make the water high So? Even a little rain can cause flood [Thunder] Hold it. Hold it tight. Arwin! Ejla! I'm so tired. Hold me tight. Hold me. Breathe. [Thunder] [Flowing water] Look rain has stopped. hold on to me Water level will drop. [Fly] Nature has giving us another chance. All we had some dirty water now its gone [Car door is closing] [Footsteps] Shh! Are they coming out to us? I don't know, but we need to hide. Hey! Over here! Shh! they are not for us. They are not looking for us They could find us Calm down. Don't be afraid. do as I say Calm down, don't be afraid. What if they are pretend we may not know Look around. Maybe someone is injured. Maybe they are here to rescue us [Gunshots] That cannot be. They have guns. Why they are searching for the wounded than I don't know. I don't know. [The car's engine cranks] [Theme music] If we don't get out of here will end up like him We got no food. I'm afraid only strong rain can help us. Arvin, we will only get weaker if we don't eat anything. All we can do is to wait for rain. We can't survive on water alone eve if we do we wont have any energy to move We will be here for one more day. [Footsteps] Animals again? Yes. We need to make fire even it has rained. [Silence] We need to scare them. [Silence] [Laughing] You can't scare them like that. Why not? See? No sounds. They afraid and they're gone. [Smile] [Silence] [Theme music] [Strange sound] Ah.

Please, look at my neck. is there anything wrong It's all fine. Just a mark of the needle. Look at mine too. [Intense music] What? Ejla? How is that? Good? No, don't worry. Everything is fine. [Smile] If this is the case, why didn't we get affected then? Everyone seems to have been affected differently. According to the immune system some might be imune and some might have it slower than others and some not affected. So... So the test they made has failed ? The injection made us aggressive just like that. so dont we failed on failed attempts but they are wrong there are the positive ones in or less Ejla. I need to wash my face. [Silence] I can't tell him this. I can't. [She's crying] Damn it! What is this? [Water splash] [Intense music] Are you all right? Why are you crying? No, I'm fine. I'm just afraid that we don't get out of here. All will be good. Trust me. We will not give up. We need to fight. [Silence] [Theme music] Arvin! Arvin! [Intense music] [Scream] [Theme music] Ah! What happened? Nothing. I just... I stumbled. Are you okey? Just thirsty. I'm thirsty. [Water splash] It is cloudy today. It will rain. Arvin, are you okey? Eat it. You are hungry too. What is that?
