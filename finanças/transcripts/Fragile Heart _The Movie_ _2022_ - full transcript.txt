(dramatic music) (dramatic music) (soft music) (bell dings) - [Announcer] Train 933 now boarding. 933 now boarding for San Diego. (clock ticking) - [Woman] Leave us alone! Stop! - Hey. Guys, come on. Please, sweetie. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Angel, please, please. - Leave us alone! (screaming) - Hey! (groaning) - Derek! Derek! Derek! Please help! (woman yelling) Help me! (Savannah crying) - Dinner and a show. (woman yelling) - [Woman] Somebody help me please! Derek! (monitor beeping) - We're going to do everything we can. Okay? (Danny grunting) (Danny sniffing) - Whew. (clapping) Start the day. - Knock, knock. Danny. Come on, man. - Who's there? - We don't have a door. - Your jokes are horrible. They're worse than the smell around here. - Nah, that ain't true. Did Dustin leave? - Yeah. - With a couple of guys. My senses are telling me, they're not good for your brother. You know them? - Troublemakers. If they come back, stay away from 'em, okay? You, uh, hanging around or you moving on? - Thinking about staying a little while longer if that's okay. Mi paso elevado es su overpass - Hey, Scout. I'm sorry you're in this situation. I'm glad you're here. (Savannah screaming) - What? What? What!? (bird talking) - Can I please have a cup of coffee? (Greta sighs) - Drama queen. - Quit it, Chubby. I'm not in the mood. - I'm gonna have a heart attack in this damn place. I mean it! (soft music) - [Chubby] It's my birthday. It's my birthday. - No, it's not, Chubby, it's in two days. I told you that. Wyatt, why are you walking around naked? - I don't swim fully clothed. That's your thing. I got nothing to hide. - Put some pants on, please. No one wants to see a malnourished anatomy. - That's fake news, sis. Have you seen Insta lately? It's ridiculous. I take my shirt off, a thousand views. Tells the story of man destined for... Hello. - Where did you... Give me the gun, Wyatt. - Can't. I need it to shoot rodents while I'm sunning. I may even take these off. Oh no, selfie in the buff. - Give it to me or I'll take it. I'm not joking. - Why? It's my house now. No one lives here anymore. I can do whatever the hell I want. I'm an adult. I have the right. (solemn music) - I know you're hurting just like me. - Yep. Got it. - Stop it. - You live at the train station and they're dead. Catch up, sis. - Don't disrespect them! - Nothing says rich kid like a pool, a half naked teen, and a gun. Guess I'll have to make it work without the gun. I'm an influencer, baby. - [Greta] Your coffee, Miss Savannah. (soft music) - We've never gotten along and now- - He loves you. - I love him too but... Did my dad tell you to wear that maid thing? 'Cause you know, you don't have to wear it. It feels oppressive. - Oh, gosh no. Your parents have always been good to me. It's my uniform. I like wearing it. It gives me purpose. (upbeat music) Keeps things straight. You know? - Uh-huh. I can see that. You wanna dunk it in my coffee? (Greta laughing) - You went again. (Greta sighs) Miss Savie, nothing good can come- - This is really good coffee so that must mean that Aldo is off today. - He is. See, that's the thing. - What? - I don't wanna speak for Aldo, but, you know me, I don't like gossip and stuff. You know that. - Land the plane, Greta. - We love you and your family, but hard truth. - Yes. - You haven't paid us in a while. - You don't do that? (Greta scoffs) Sorry. I just haven't been thinking clearly. I just, just kind of thought you do everything. (Greta laughing) - I do do everything. - Yeah. - We're heartbroken. We, we love it here. We love you and your shit head stepbrother. He has bills. Me, I could stay on for free. - No, no, no. There's plenty of money. - Well that's good 'cause I've got bills too. - Okay, um, I'll figure something out before I leave. - You're leaving? - Yeah. I've been thinking about it, you know, getting away for a while. - Well that's great. You could use a vacation. What do you want me to do about Jade? - Who's she? - He. - He then. - Your 15 year old cousin on your stepmom's side. He's being dropped off next week. Oh, more. His parents are leaving the planet for some space adventure. I'm serious. - So I'm not sure how long I'll be gone. - A week? A month? Really? - Wyatt doesn't need me. He doesn't listen to me. He's 19. He's an adult. Okay. So we'll work out all the financial stuff, you'll have access to whatever you need and you can live here as long as you'd like. - I see. Well, let me clean this up. (groaning) and tell Aldo he's still got a job. Now I won't have to bust my arthritic hump doing twice as much around here, cleaning the toilets and cooking the meals. It's not very sanitary if you ask me. - You don't have to do it in that order. Probably not the point. (soft music) - Come over here. - Now she's coming over. She's so depressing. - Callate, Rickey. Her parents were murdered, demon child. - Well, I didn't do it. - Hey, Emma. - Why do we have to do time? - Hey, you look serious this time. You're really leaving? - Bye. Good luck. - Bye. - He doesn't like me. - Poor thing got his own problems. See that guy over there? Think his name's Danny. He got Rickey his job here. This yours? - Oh, no. - It's yours. Seen you wear it. - Okay. Just give it to me and no I'm not dissing Jesus. It's just complicated right now. Must have fallen off. - Mm-hmm. Anyway. All that luggage for real? - Yes. I'm leaving. - I've been praying for you. - I need it. Thank you. - Where you going, sweetie? - I don't know. Um, to explore life, I guess. Find myself, heal. Forget. I don't really have a plan, but you've always been so incredibly nice to me and I appreciate it. Thanks again. I'm gonna go sit down. - Hmm. Emma Bristing, here's your chance. Hold on. You don't feel like talking? - If that's okay. - Uh-huh. You know you ain't talked to get better. - Oh? Tell me more. Enlighten me, information booth. - How you feeling right now? - Well, I'm not sure what I'm sensing from you. Did I offend you or? - We talk and we talk and why? You don't have to like being a victim to be one. - What the hell? I'm not the victim. My parents were the victims and no one heard them or cared to help. - So, are you saying that's how you feel? - Okay. You're acting so strange. Bye, Emma. - 22 911 calls. People cared. They were scared. They rushed to help your father. - Yeah, they might as well just stepped over his body. - That's not what happened, Savannah. You won't want what words can't give. I've been there. I'm not judging you. I'm just pointing out- - I said I appreciate it so good day. - When you pull out the good day, you know it's over. - Shut up. I don't know why I said that. (sighing) It's not nonsense. - It's always so difficult to know the right thing to say to a person when they're suffering. You'll just sit right there. I wanna comfort you and tell you how sorry I am, 'cause I am, but I'm running outta ways to say it, sweetie. - Why are you upset with me? - I'm not upset. I'm listening. Your heart is getting bitter, not better. That's real. That's Emma's love. - I can't just turn it off. Don't you think if I could, I would? All right. I'm not a light switch clicking on, clicking off. Click, click, click, click, click, click. - Well, I think we've gone off track. - Gosh. Oh, Savannah, how are you? Oh, I'm great. Fantastic! That's what everyone wants to hear. No one really wants to know! Just shut up you whining victim! - Can I help? - No. We're trying something new today. - Gosh, you weak, pathetic victim. (sobbing) Gosh, and I'm weak and I can't do this without them and I don't... Gosh. Gosh, I just want to speak in deep scary voice right now and I'm losing my mind and I, ugh, I just... I don't know how to move on, Emma. - There it is. Let it out. Those feelings don't wanna be held. Or that demon voice inside of you. - Just, I'm just really confused and I just wanna go sit down. Okay? I just wanna go sit down. - Yes. Sit down, like a broken record. The needle is stuck. - I honestly, from the bottom of my broken heart, didn't realize a heavy burden that I've placed on this booth and in my defense, if I truly need to defend myself, I'm new at this. - That's good. What does that feel like? - All I wanted to do was sit on my bench. - [Emma] And wait for what? - I'm not hurting anyone, okay? And I've told you, I'm trying to figure things out. - That's all crazy talk. You got to buy a ticket to get on a train, and I've been standing here the entire time. No ticket. Listen to me, Savannah. You're paralyzed. Look, you're not mourning, Savannah. You're obsessing. Anyone can see that. A blind squirrel can find that nut. But until you see it, you're not leaving. Not those days. Not today. Not any day. - But I am. Yes, I am. I just haven't decided yet where. - You're like my laundry, your cycle is on extra spin. It hurts me to see what you're doing to yourself. - Just keep hurling those analogies. It's really helpful. - You always look so lost. - 'Cause I am, Emma. I am lost. All right? I'm lost and I'm lost and I'm lost, lost. - I know, baby. Let it all out. - Gosh, you guys sell a ticket to the past? I'll take one ticket back to life I used to have before this filthy inbred, ball-less, cockroach, bastard, little- - Okay. Get it out, but let's keep it down. - The low life scum sucking waste of humanity, jackal, parasite, ass wipes destroyed my family. Hold on. Wait right there. - I may have pushed too hard. - I'll take one please. I want a damn ticket anywhere, but here. - Maybe we should apply the brakes. - I'm suffocating! I can't breathe, I can't function! I'm so sick of having panic attacks while I'm eating or I'm crapping or I'm showering, or shop I'm sleeping, that's the only... And the only time they leave me alone is when I'm here because when I'm here, I'm numb. (laughing) Isn't that, the most psychotic thing you've ever heard is I'm in absolute agony. And you are like the only one willing to listen. I just feel... (Savannah sighing) I just... I have no friends. Well I have like one and Greta, I guess. I just actually thought you cared. - I do. Okay. That's enough for today. Don't look all sad. I am your friend. Who else would risk losing their job doing this? I was challenging you. Purging the junk. I took a self-help quasi-psychology class at night. It was mostly because of you. I won't lie. I got scared. I almost lost you. Your toes were in the deep end, but you came back. - You swapped out the bar stool for a couch. - I just ran with the moment given. - I'm on the brink of a nervous breakdown. Surely you can see that. Would you like me to tear my clothes off, run naked through the train station and throw my body on the tracks? - I'm still learning. - I'm sure, deeply confident, there were less antagonistic ways we could have done this. God just, I don't know where I'm supposed to be. I mean this, this stupid train station is the only place that makes sense. (solemn music) I can't leave them here alone. I don't know how to help them. - You'll see them again. That may not be as comforting as it should be right now, but you know where they're at. That's a promise. But until then, there's lots of life needing to be lived. That's what they would want. - Okay. You've given me lot to process. I'm just, I'm gonna go sit down. (Savannah sniffing) Can you please not stare at me? - Sorry. You seem upset. - Wow, how in the wide world did you come to that conclusion? Look, I don't mean to be rude. I just don't feel very social right now. - Absolutely. - I apologize. I'm not myself lately. - It's okay. Believe me, I've seen and heard worse. So, you traveling far? - Why is everyone so damn worried about my travel plans today? - You wanna prove her wrong? - What? I'm sorry. Can you please sit somewhere else? This is my bench. They told me I could have it. Or something. - I could, but that would make it harder to talk to you. (soft music) I don't have an angle. I've seen that stare before. I'm not a serial killer. I do enjoy eating cereal maybe a little too much, but I don't live with my mom or a lot of cats. You wanna leave? I'm not trying to pick up on you. - Leave with you? - Yes. - Oh. She put you up to this. Nice one, Emma. - I don't know him. Promise. But he is handsome. Don't act crazy. - I want to take you out for the day. Have fun. No strings attached, just two strangers enjoying a break from the norm. Best people to talk to are the ones you owe nothing to so. I think. Listen, I know you think I'm nuts, but I- - Actually I'm starting to think that you're a mind reader. - Why not? One day, throw caution to the wind. Be spontaneous. Two young people being free. Problems at are back, wind in our hair. You like tacos? (Savannah laughing) - Am I on camera? I don't... No, I don't think so. I don't know you and it's just not who I am. Trust me. I'm not a fun date right now. It just seems strange. - It's not a date. Hi, I'm Danny. Danny Scott. - It can't be any stranger than sitting in a train station all day with nowhere to go. - Excuse me. You think you know me? You don't, okay? You don't. - You're right. I only know what you shared with, well, all of us here earlier. - Wow. Insulting. That's an interesting choice. I've been down out of the dating scene a while. Is that the new bad boy approach? It's not working for you. Jack ass alert! Ha, Am I right? This guy. No, I didn't mean you! That's right. Keep walking. Just mind your of business. The human race, everyone. Whatever you do, don't get too involved. Scared little rabbits! (sighing) I'm getting it all out, Emma. It's working. It's really working. - I'm just gonna say it. You seem like a very fun person. - You're still here. - Yeah. You don't scare me. - She has zero plans for the day. Possibly for the rest of her life. Her schedule is wide open. Wide open. Good luck. I've seen you around here before. (camera clicks) Danny. Now I got a picture of you just in case. Have fun, kids. - Oh gosh, please. Please, please leave me alone. Okay? Or something bad is going to happen. I'm not emotionally stable enough to have this conversation with you or be hit on right now. Trust me. Thank you for the effort, but trust me. - You can keep saying trust you. If we're sharing, I don't trust a lot of people. Hasn't really paid off for me, but I like you and I don't trust you, but you have this certain, I don't know, call it certifiable quality about you. It's hard to resist. - How cool, you really get me. - And for the second or third time, I'm not hitting on you. I don't come to train stations to pick up on girls. That's creepy. I'm just trying to help. Not that you're a charity case or anything else I might say that would provoke you to hit me. I just like being nice. - Why? - Because people should be. Remember that guy that just walked by? - I remember, it just happened. - I want do something nice for you. Please. I bet I could make you smile. Can't be opposed to that. - No, not smiling in general, but- - Perfect. - I smile. - Funny thing is you haven't actually definitively said no. - Give up. She's not leaving, Danny. Savannah just gonna sit on that damn bench and wait for God knows what. Come back tomorrow. She'll be here. She's not going anywhere. - Yes I am old lady. I know what you're doing, Emma. - Let it go. - Oh, I need to think. - You know what they say? Laughter is the best medicine. - Got it. Thank you Dr. I appreciate it. Are you least a nice guy? - I think so. - Oh, I don't care. You seem honest. Look, Emma, I'm making a decision. - You go, girl! - My life is a spiraling tragedy so let's go. Oh, and my mood swings are out of control. They're scary. You want out? - You don't scare me. - It's over when I say it's over. Agreed? Trusting you. This is stupid. Whatever. Keep the picture. If I'm not back at 8:00 p.m., call the police, okay? And Emma, I swear if this goes psycho wrong and I end up in a shallow grave or the sicko's twisted demented torture basement, I'll haunt you. - Okay. Have fun. I'm off at 7:00. - Exciting. (upbeat music) - I'm driving. - I don't have a car. ♪ Rise to the occasion ♪ ♪ Sociable, watered-down soul ♪ ♪ Hide behind the curtains ♪ ♪ Count your breath and blessings ♪ ♪ Little star, fallen ♪ ♪ Where does the time go ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Oh, where does the time go ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Raining in the kitchen ♪ ♪ Temperamental kitten ♪ ♪ Lose your cool, everybody's fool ♪ - So, Danny, you do that often? - What? Save people at train stations? - No, stare at people. And I did not need saving. - I was joking. Sorry. Yes I do. I look at something or someone and I drift off. It's like I'm in a trance or a- - What were you doing there? - I'm sorry for staring. - I mean, it makes me a little uncomfortable, but it's not just you, it's when anyone does it. It's me, I'm a little self-conscious but I'm getting better. Seriously. What were you doing there? - Uh, I was looking for someone, wasn't there. Meant to be. I met you. (Savannah laughs) - Who? - It's a long story. I'm still trying to figure it all out. - What do you see when you drift? Is it... I cut you off. I do that. Sorry. - That's all right. It's hard to explain. It's like I'm being told a secret. Sometimes like I'm allowed to see beauty. Something that's being hidden. Something only I can see. That's how I process I guess. It's weird. I know. - No, it's not. I actually- - Stop! - What the? What are you doing? Okay. I'm gonna leave. - Wait, you didn't hit it. - That's good. Hit what? (dog barking) - Come here. Ah, he's fast. Oh, he's playing with us. - [Savannah] Come here. Come on. - Oh. I wonder if he lives around here. Hey, get over here! Get over here! Come here. Sit Oh. (dog barking) Here. Come on, humans. Is that all you got? (chime dinging) (upbeat music) - You think he'll like this kind? - I would. - That's disgusting. - I got it. Um, I'm almost done here. There's so many choices. - I'll pay for it. It's okay. - I'll get the next round. - Okay. (register beeping) - 7.48. - Yeah. Um. Just... (register opening) Just keep it. It's okay. Please just put it in the tip jar or something. - No. - Yes. - Thank you. - Savannah. It's not what you think. (engine revving) - Get out of the way! - It's not what you think. Give me one minute to explain. 60 seconds. - I'll drag your body down the street. Move liar. Thief! - I believe you will murder me. I do. Please just listen to me. - You're not a good person. You lied to me. You're just a con man, petty thief. Oh, I hate... - Listen to me, please. - Stupid. What the hell was I thinking? (sighing) For a split second I believed you! Gosh, you suck! (sighing) If you needed cash, I have money. Oh wow, that's it. You heard that my parents are rich and... Oh, wow! Gosh. Idiot! - Oh, you. I really want to cuss right now. - So do it. What are you, a child? And who says that? It's weird. (Danny grunting) What are you doing? - Nothing. It's just, it's something I- you know what? Nevermind. - Are you crying? - No, I'm not crying. What's wrong with you? I don't cry. (grunting) - Then are you okay? You rich people think it's all about your money. Your world starts and stops with the cash coming out of your ass. - Rude. Not true. And you don't know me. - But I'm a liar and a thief. Right? You know me? - No, I don't. Isn't that the point? - I was just trying to do something nice. I made you smile. I made you laugh. I kept my word. Give me my dog. Rogue, come. - She doesn't know her name yet. You're crazy. - You've be wrong about a lot today. You should quit talking and start listening more. - Well, you should work that out with Emma then. She wants me to talk more. You want me to talk less. - You don't get it. To be clear, for those not listening, she implied you need to start speaking with purpose. But to do that, you have to at least hear yourself. (soft music) Oh. And by the way, I have money. Lots of it. I could dress a small, no, a large village. People clothed in money, large bills. I don't need your money. - I have Rogue's food. I bought it. My bird's finicky. He won't eat it. So take it. I don't feel guilty. I don't owe you an apology. Will you please stop, okay? I'm not good at this. I'm gonna crash into a parked car or I'm gonna hit a bicycle person. - What. - I want to listen. I'd like to know why you stole the candy. - I'll be right back. - Hola, Mr. Scott. Mr. Scott brought more candy. Eso estoy viendo. Guardalo para despues de la cena. - What do you say? - Thank you, Mr. Scott. - You're welcome, Mr. Isaac. - How can I teach him not to take candies from strangers when you keep coming around? - Hi, Liz. Sorry. You mentioned pretzels last time I was here. - You're too kind. Thank you. - I have to go, my friend's waiting in the car, but I'll be back next week to clear out the gutters. - Bye. - Bye. Good people. (soft music) Isaac and his mom were cheated. The store owner, the guy at the register, he stole from them. I was there, I saw him do it. So I'm righting your wrong. Maybe not the way others would, but I'm making a difference the way I know how. - The guy's a jerk. I understand your point, but stealing? I mean, he stole from them and you just steal from him- - He overcharged them. Kept their money. Money they don't have. I'm just giving them back what's theirs. They deserve some justice. He did it 'cause he knew he could. He knew they wouldn't say anything. - I know a little thing about wanting justice. I get it. - Yeah. Sorry. Taking advantage of someone because they're weak or less fortunate it's the worst kind of person. I'm gonna give them back what's owed from the thief who took it. - Maybe you could have confronted him. - Being the upstanding citizen he is, I'm sure he would've apologized and given it back. (Savannah chuckles) - You make a compelling point. - I don't know why. It's a childhood thing. I freeze in moments like that. Ever since I was a kid. My mom used to make fun of my dad for doing it too. I hate it. (Danny sighing) Freud would've lost sleep over my family. Too much? Time to go? - No. I just understand. - If I have time to think, process it, things start to make sense. I'm gonna take what's owed then, till it makes sense to stop. That might be awhile. - Let's go shopping. - Liquor store? - Complicated works for me right now. So, you are a good person, Danny. - Scott. You forgot. - Dan Scott. (chuckles) - I'm not sure if I am, but I'm trying to be, Savannah. - Biel. - I know. - Oh. (chuckles) Really, did that have to be awkward? - Can I hug you back? I'm gonna hug you back. - Okay. - I bought the pretzels. (Savannah chuckling) - Hey Danny. - What's up, Caesar? - Come here often? (Danny laughing) - The food's amazing here. You should try the carne asada burrito. It will wreck you. - Burger special's good too. - Um. - Unless you're vegan. - No, I'm not vegan obviously. So wreck me and he's paying so wreck me hard. I'll take onion rings and something diet. - A burger cut in half, no onion, extra pickles and chili cheese fries, five burger specials and- - Oh, you're probably gonna need six today. They've been coming around out back since you started doing this. - Six is good. And a bottle of water to go with each of those, please. Actually eight specials. I'll need two to go. You'll, uh, hand out the rest? - Sure. Cool. It's nice of you. - I'll grab the two when I leave. Oh, and you got something for my new friend outside? and some water? - No problem. That's $86 and 13 cents minus the employee discount. - Thanks, man. - Total $77 and 52 cents. (register beeping) - Does he also touch our food? - Um, my feet are clean. Mostly. - Hmm. (chuckles) Can we sit here please? - Sure. - Okay. Cool. What just happened? - You let me pay for your meal. It's a big step. I really thought you were gonna fight me on that one. - If it's done with respect I'm good with a man paying my way. - I hide it in the left shoe because muggers always check the right shoe first. - Hmm. So that's your story. - I'll answer your question if you answer one for me. - I accept the challenge, but I'll see your question and I'll raise you one. When my parents were alive, my dad and my stepmom, my, my real mom died when I was really young. We used to play this game called "Say Anything". You could ask any two questions and say anything with full impunity, no shame, consequence or judgment. Two each. (upbeat music) - Hi, Danny. - Thank you. - You in? - Uh. - Hmm? I think it was you that said the best people to talk to are the ones you owe nothing to. Oh my God. Wow. (laughing) That was really hot. Was not expected. Hmm. Like. - Why didn't you wanna sit next to Carla? - Okay. Game on. Wow, the roof of my mouth, it's like, it's like the coating's way rougher than I thought. It's like shag carpet up in there right now. - You okay? - Mm-hmm. Uh, the homeless woman? - Yes. The woman that no longer has a place to live. - Careful. Your tone sounds like judgment. - Sorry. - Because I'm mad at all of them. - Can I give a rebuttal? - Hm, not usually how the game is played, but I'll allow it. And it counts as your second anything. - There are 7,000 plus people living on the streets in Orange County. You think they all conspired? - I'm not really holding myself to a rational standard right now so (sighing) probably not. - Most of them are good, kind people, hurting and down with little support to get back up. - Well I'm afraid of them, Danny. - They act crazy. Like Carla over there, talking to herself. Okay. Not a good look. But mental illness sucks. Our system sucks. The organizations that do help, they can't force someone to stay if they wanna leave so they don't get the care they need. The two guys that attacked your parents, they're... What? I'm sorry. I'll change the subject. - No, it's, it's fine. I'm listening. - They're a small percentage. We have to help each other. - You're right, but like you said, some of them don't want help. What then? - Let 'em go I guess. I'm still working on that answer. We're an evolved society of intelligent creative people. We have to figure out an answer. We just shouldn't give up. At least not on the ones that can't make the choice. I think my time's up. Your turn. - Um. How do you know all these people? - They're all around us. You just have to see them. I'm just gonna take this over. - Okay. Yeah. I'm gonna go to the bathroom, so. - Oh my goodness. Thank you. No onions though, right? - And extra pickles. Your a picky bag lady, Carla. - You know, my son is about your age. I have his letters. Ah, here they are. Look at, see, it says, "Mom." - Hmm. - I sure do miss him. (Savannah panting) (dramatic music) (Savannah coughing) - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Oh my God. Okay. Okay. Oh God. Please don't do this to me. (crying) It's okay. It's okay. Keep it together. Keep it together. Thew walls are white. Um, it's filthy. This is the most disgusting bathroom I've ever been in. Okay. Except for those. That's pretty I guess. Okay. One, two, three, four, five. Three, two, one. Two. (sobbing) Three. Three, four. Three, two, one. Okay. Okay. Phew. All right. Hear the water. Oh my God. I hate this. Okay. Hear the water. One, two, three. (exhaling) Pull it together, girl. (exhaling) Just breathe. Just breathe. (soft music) ♪ The smile that's on your face ♪ ♪ The warmth of your embrace ♪ - You good? - Yes.

'Cause I don't eat onions. They, they make your soul cry. Just like your eyes. Oh, but where are my manners? Bless you. But I don't eat onions. - Okay. Well maybe the breading maybe or burrito. - Oh, well the breading touched the onions. No, I don't, can't do that, but maybe I could give it away 'cause I don't like to waste. So I could give it to someone. - Thank you. - I'm ready to go home now. - Okay. (soft music) Okay. Well, I hope I didn't do something to upset you. - No, today was unexpected and fun. So thank you. - I'd give you my number, but I lost my phone. I don't remember where I left it. - It's okay. Really. No one was asking for it and I understand. - No, really? - Okay. - Hey, Say Anything. You didn't get your turn. That's not very fair. It's like, uh, Jungle-manji. Whatever that game is. Play till we finish. - All right. Yeah. That's how it works I guess. Forgot. Um. All right. Um. I haven't hugged anyone since my dad died. Actually, it's been a while since I let anyone hug me, touch me. And I love hugs, but I've gained a few pounds. So I wonder if they can feel the small, I don't know what you call them, ripples, I guess, I have on my side under each arm, That was really vulnerable. (chuckles) - Yeah. - So thank you for the hug earlier. I needed it. And for the burrito I didn't eat. (laughing) And the liquor store we knocked off. We'll likely do time for that, which I did say I was going away. And I'm nervous so I'm talking a lot. Oh, and the dog. Who gets Rogue? - We can share custody, right? - I feel like you have more to give than I do right now. - That's when you need a dog the most. Hey, when did we meet? - Mm. A long time ago. - That's what I thought. You got one more. - You use it. I feel sufficiently bare right now. - Is that allowed? - We make up the rules as we go. - Okay. Well, I have something I want to tell you. - How about we don't play the game and you just say it. - Uh, I'm nervous too. I need impunity. (both laughing) - Okay. - I think you're beautiful, Savannah. I know you don't know me- - That's nice to hear. Thank you. Get a phone. I'm going home. - Come on, Rogue. Meet your new roommates, huh? (dog barking) I'm glad your travel plans changed. - And I'm glad the person you were meeting flaked. Should you be worried? - It was my brother, Dustin. He's a good man. He's homeless. He hangs out at the station sometimes. (Savannah sighing) - Hey, um, you go to save the world again, take me with you. - Rogue, come here. (dog barking) And there he goes. - Yeah. (dog barking) Oh, who is this handsome boy? A boy. Right? - This is Rogue. Rogue, this is Carol Singer. And this guy is- - Oh, you're so friendly. We call him Boy Scout, B-Scout for short. - Nice to meet ya. Can you sit? - Sit. Aw, look at that. Of course he can. He's so smart. - Is Dustin back yet? - Yeah. He's in the tent. He's been loud, been yelling things again. - Sorry. Is he okay? - Seems like it. - Hey! Who is he? What's his name? - I don't know. - Came through about two hours ago. - I only bought two meals. - Oh, I already ate. - Smell good too. Homeless life seems to agree with you. - I'm good, Danny. Thanks. - Well. - I'm coming. - Do you mind sharing this with him? - Split it right down the middle. - And I got snacks. Lots of snacks. - Never say no to snacks. - Thank you. - Did you hear about the liquor store that got looted today? - Uh, no. What happened? - Place got cleaned out. They found him in the bathroom, gagged and tied up. - He's a jerk. - And a pervert. The police found recordings and pictures of some really bad stuff, - Shameful. That's shameful. - Bonus. Dustin. - [Dustin] I'm okay, Danny. I'm working on something really important and I need to think so okay. - I haven't seen you for a while. - It's big. It's bigger than than the best idea I've ever had, Danny. - You keep disappearing. Can I come in for a second? - [Dustin] It's really important. No one gets it, I just have to think. - I have snacks. - Okay. You can come in then. (soft music) - What are you working on? - Don't tell anyone. It's gonna make us rich. - I won't. Hey, you remember those two guys that came through camp a few weeks ago? Kind of mean, you said didn't like 'em. You remember? - I don't know, Danny. You told them to leave. - Yeah, those guys. Have you seen 'em around? - Hey. Do you think mom would loan me the money for this? I, I'll give it back. - I'm happy to take the smaller half. - No, no, no. You're, you're too thin. - Will you ask her for me? - I don't think so. She doesn't really understand. - Well, she's got it. I know she does. I'll ask her on her birthday. - Dustin. Have you seen them around lately? It's okay. I just, I need to know if you've seen them. - I went with them a few times. Scout knows. He asks me questions about them. - Yeah. He told me. B-Scout's looking out for you. You can trust him. - They're not really that bad. They're nice to me. I need friends too, Danny, and I need money too. - Listen to me. I don't want you to hang out with them anymore. Okay? - I can. - No, you can't. - Okay. It's time you leave my tent. - It's gonna be like that. Huh? You kicking me out? Oh. - Whoa. You don't feel well again? - I'm fine. I'm fine. - You always say that. I'm gonna sleep. - Okay. We'll talk more in the morning. All right? You wanna get some breakfast with me at the beach? (Dustin chuckles) - It's a date. Ah. - What? What'd I do? - Uh. It's a funny story. That's why you don't sharpen a knife on skin. - You all right? Let me see. (somber music) Who said that to you? Was it them? Do you know where they are? - I'm okay, Danny, don't worry- - Dustin. - No, I don't know. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - You don't have to worry about me. I mean, just because I'm younger than you doesn't mean I can't take care of myself. You know, Danny. - I know. (soft music) I know. We'll take care of each other. - Yeah. - I love you. - I love you too. (Danny shuddering) (people chattering) (upbeat music) - Birthday. - What the? - Happy birthday. - You okay? Huh, you good, Chubby? - Happy birthday. Chubby birthday. - Are you Savannah? - Who are you? Where's Wyatt? - Not sure. Upstairs maybe. - I'm Jade. Your cousin. It's a pleasure to meet you. - You weren't supposed to be here until, at all. - Yeah. I'm sorry. I just go where the rents take me. - Rents? - My parents. I'll stay out of the way. - No, that's not what I- Greta. - Oh, thank God you're here. I am not okay. I did not allow this. Wyatt, he's out of control. I am alone here. Aldo wouldn't come in. Just fire him, fire him! These people, they don't have any respect. They keep calling me the hobbit lady. I am not that short. - Okay, calm down. I'm home now, okay? It's just a party, right? Just tell them to leave. - Since you've been gone, I have bitten all my fingernails off. I've eaten my weight in skin! I can't stop chewing. I'm like a goat. If I could reach my toenails, they'd be gone too. - I've been gone nine hours. - You said you weren't coming back. You know I don't like stress. - Excuse me. Someone's taking a dump in the pool you have. - Oh gross. - And they told me to tell the Hobbit. - See? - Please don't call her that. - Hey Savannah, would you like me to turn down the music so you can kick these losers out of your home? - He's an angel. - Yes, please. That would be great. - All right, losers, get out! Go sponge off someone else's kindness. Bunch of dejects. - You got your way, didn't you? Crazy little bird. Puppet master from the gilded cage. (person knocking) - Come in. - Hey. Nice party. - Chubby's birthday. - In two days. - It was a surprise party. The music stopped. What happened? - Can we talk? - No. I thought you moved. Didn't expect you back so soon. - Can see that. I met someone. I don't know. It's only been a day, but it's insane, I... - You deserve to be happy. Let it happen, sis. - Thank you, Wyatt. He's different. (solemn music) Drinking isn't the answer, Wyatt. - You're right. 30 year old bourbon tastes like lighter fluid anyways. I'll take a cold deer. - I know it's easier to ignore it, but we need to figure this out. We need to work together. I need you. We can make it work. - You sound like a bad environmental ad. - Yeah. I felt that. I've been doing it all day. I, I got upset and I told my friend, Emma, good day. - You're weird. Speaking of, our cousin Jade is here. - Yeah. I met him. Seems polite. - Well, he does this weird nose thing. - I saw that. It's funny. This is nice. It's been a good day. I wanna talk to you. - We are. - I wanna talk to you about mom and dad. - I'm good. Maybe tomorrow. Please. - Okay. But you're at least gonna come downstairs and help clean up, right? - I'm gonna hang up here. I'll do it tomorrow. Just leave it. - Okay.

(tense music) (camera clicking) (Savannah laughing) I think we make a good team. - Yeah. I mean, how are we gonna help those people? - I've tried. It's complicated. - Oh my gosh. I'm shaking. I just pointed my gut at someone, that just happened. - Yeah. Where the heck did you get that thing? - My brother's. - I don't have the keys. Kidding. - Oh my god. (laughing) - Why the gun? You brought that for protection. From me. - No. (laughing) - That's my girl. (engine starts) I've tried to buy the homes they use for their operations, including this one. But they won't sell. I have a friend who works for the city. He tells me when and where they're gonna buy the next house. They have houses everywhere. Other states, drug sales, trafficking. Everything you just saw. They've warned me to back off. - Yeah, but how is busting up this place gonna help those poor people? I mean, we need to do something. We need to do something more. - I've called the police. I've tried. Places are cleared out, more arrive. The dealers are ghosts. They trade and use people like... Savannah. These guys, they're not human. - You think they could have to do something with my parents murder? - I don't know. In a roundabout way, maybe. - If I was in my right mind, I'd burn it all to the ground. - [Danny] You consider that to be in your right mind? - Well, I'd say a few holes aren't gonna matter. - True. But I know this girl. She's in a lot of pain, could use an outlet and that matters. I'm no Emma, but I can't think of a better way to blow off some steam. It's a twofer. - Hmm. (soft music) Oh. (laughing) That felt so good. Anger art. (laughing) Oh. That felt good. - You got a big canvas to work with. Oh. - Yeah. What? Come on. It's only fun trashing a house when you do it with a friend. - Oh, that's not good. - What? What? - Slipping into the friend zone. - Oh. Shut up. (laughing) - I'm gonna watch for a second. Just giving you a head start. You've got more, uh, more to get out than I do. - That's true. - Well, unless you factor in my mom, she's a complicated woman. Maybe I will help. - [Savannah] You okay? - You really need to quit asking me that. I'm fine. - Okay. Well, here we go. - Oh, ho, ho. Whoa. (laughing) Nice. - [Savannah] Whoa. (Danny laughing) Whoa. - You're a hard target to miss. Classic. - Just never know what you're gonna say in moments like that. - And you've given that a lot thought, have you? - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. One day when I'm in a drug house facing the shadow of death, what on earth am I gonna say? Hey goon, if you know what's good for ya. Well, that's, that won't do. Oh, I know. You're a hard target to miss. Yeah. That hits the spot. - You enjoy yourself, don't you? (Danny laughing) So you wanna come in? Not like that. That's stupid. - I didn't say anything. - Yes, you did. That grin guys get. I haven't ever had sex. Oh wow. All day. The most intimate and embarrassing thoughts for everyone to hear. You wanna guess my weight next? (Danny laughing) I have no gate right now. I'm clearly delirious and tired. - Well, good day to you then madam. - Yep. That's what I mean. (soft music) - Truth is I wanna wait, for me and for my parents and for God, even though I'm mad at Him. - I respect that. Anyway, even if you were putting out, yeah, (laughing) I can't, I'm taking my brother to breakfast. - I'm sorry about earlier. I was being insensitive. - Oh, that's all right. I brought it up and it's hard to know what to do. - I know, I have a brother, stepbrother. He's not doing well with everything and just trying to heal. So, are you just gonna walk home or? - Yeah. It's a nice day out and I walked here. - I can't figure you out. - Is that important to you? - It is if I'm gonna keep seeing you. You wanna keep seeing me? - Yeah. That'd be nice. - I'm gonna say one more stupid thing before I get some rest and overthink it. - Say anything? - No, judge me if you must. In comparison to other things I've said today, it's not really that big of a deal. I've never been on a real date before. My dad, I love him, but third grade father/daughter date doesn't count. I've never had my first kiss either. I want it to be something I tell my grandkids. Is that weird? - No. Hey Savannah. - Hmm? - I was wondering if, uh, sometime you might wanna go on a date with me. - Yes. I will consider it. It's not a pity date. Right? - Nice. I'll call you. I'll get a phone, and a car maybe. Actually a truck. I, I like trucks better. - How did you find my house? - I have a friend. - You have a lot of friends. Danny Scott, you do not add up. - I like it when you say my last name. (ceiling thuds) - Ugh, what now? He's probably with someone He will hate me for interrupting. Wyatt? Wyatt, I just need to know you're okay. Okay. I'm coming in so. (suspenseful music) Oh, shit, Wyatt! God. Come on! Wyatt! Wyatt! Idiot! Greta! Greta! Greta! Help me! Help me! Do you need to leave? It's okay. It's just. Yes? - I've seen this. My mom. It doesn't look like he took pills. It's, it's something else. - Okay. - Is he breathing? - I think so. I don't know, I don't know. - Where are you? - We're here in Wyatt's room! - Help! - Then check. - Okay. Okay. (gun fires) (Greta screaming) - Did you finally kill him? - Call 911! - Oh, help me. Please, God, help. - [Jade] Call 911! Get him up. - Take the hand. Help me get him into the shower. Greta, turn the shower on! - We need help! And a firearm went off. - [Jade] Don't mention the gun! - I didn't need firearm. Fire alarm. - Arm on the shoulder. Come on. - I didn't mean firearm. He took drugs! - Greta, do you know where my dad keeps this black book? - His office. - I'm gonna need you to make some calls for me, starting with the mayor. Listen to me! (Savannah panting) (Savannah sobbing) - It says information. - I understand. - So ask me a question. I don't need all this misguided anger and emotional transference thrown at me. I didn't make you late or buy you the wrong ticket. And sir, I'm not responsible for raising you wrong. - What? - So ask me a question and maybe we fix it together. - Look. - My turn. - Hey! - You had your chance. - Y'all tripping. - Have a nice day. - Cheating on me. - What? No, he's just a patron. He meant nothing to me. He asked me a question. He bought a ticket. Unlike some. - You know what? Get past it. Why did God allow my parents to die? I mean, he had the power to stop it. Why is he trying to kill my entire family? - What? Did something go wrong? What triggered this? Our session went so well yesterday. - Come on, Emma. Dig deep. - Did the date go wrong? - No, it was amazing. I think I love him. - Hey, you been drinking? - He's God I- - Who? Danny? - No, God! Please stay focused. - I'm trying. - He could have stopped it. Why didn't he stop it? - Blaming God. We're so good at that. Savannah, God doesn't have to try to do anything. He just is and He just does. He doesn't owe us an explanation. - So He's a bully. - Not now. He's not a dictator. He's not a genie. Not a wishing well. It's not all about you. - It's about me. They're my parents. My brother almost died of an overdose a few hours ago. It's about me. - We want so bad to believe that. Help us not to feel so small in such a big world. Is Wyatt okay? (Savannah sighing) - I think so. He's at the hospital right now. - He didn't cause your brother to hurt himself. Free will mixed with bad choices did that, Savannah. If you let him, he'll work all things together for the good, but we have to trust him. Just let him be God. - Then, then I wish you would've stopped some of their choices. - Yes. As a parent, I know what that feels like. But truthfully, what's the use of looking at a menu if someone's just gonna order for you? What those monsters did, that's not God's will. He gave us the right to make up our own minds. Some do all kinds of wicked things with that freedom, and others do great things. - I'm angry, Emma. - Be pissed off, have a party. That's part of the plan. Aim it in the right direction and it may even bring change and a lot of good. I didn't learn that in some classroom. I learned that in life. - You're right, Emma, I'm gonna make some change happen. I'm mad, Emma, but I'm finally thinking straight. - That doesn't sound good. Make good choices. Poor thing. She got issues. - I'm sure his brother Dustin knows where they're at. No, I can't push him because he is not all... Look, I don't know who's involved yet so leave it. I'll check in. (phone beeps) (ominous music) - You have a cell phone. - Hey Carol, why are you up so early? - Because I'm old. - Ha. Okay. Well. - Don't hurt my friends, Scout. (people chattering) (solemn music) (Savannah laughing) - You can't hide from me. Not since we were kids, remember? - I still do. I'm sorry. - [Savannah] I brought you snacks. Some dark chocolate, soda and stuff. I got this from a liquor store I robbed earlier with a friend. The guy deserved it though. I guess. - That's really specific for a joke. - [Savannah] Yep. - Thank you for everything. - Sure. - I didn't try to kill myself. I didn't want to die, but I didn't want to live either. - I know. You don't have to explain it to me. I've been there. I mean, unless you feel like talking now then... - No, I'm good. - Are you good? Really? - No more. They're suggesting I go to this drug treatment group thing. - And? - Are you kidding? - Wyatt! - I said, yes, it'll help me boost my Instagram followers. - Idiot. - They help with more than just the drugs. I'll try it. Tired of feeling like this. (Savannah sighing) - Can I tell you something I've never told anyone before? There was this time in high school, you were like 11. And I started gaining weight. It's like no matter what I did, I couldn't lose it. All the girls were getting looked at by all the guys and asked out and the same ones I had my eyes on too. And I did everything I could to get noticed. That changed. I did everything I could to hide. I just hoped to blend in that my thighs and my pimples wouldn't be the reason to point me out. It's always a laugh, making fun of the fat girl with acne. - Dude, that pisses me off. Who do you want me to hurt? I got lots of resources. - That's sweet of you for wanting to kill someone for me, but I didn't get bullied. Not like some did, not physically anyway. That seemed to be reserved for the loners and heavier boys who couldn't defend themselves. But the emotional and psychological warfare was just as bad. The girls at my school were shamed for having sex or for not having sex or for being too skinny or being too fat or worse, just ignored by the self-appointed elite. It was death by a thousand whispers, most of them being my own in my head because I allowed myself to believe social media and the bullies. - I've said things too. I'm sorry, sis. I'm a jerk. - No, you were still young. You didn't become a jerk until later. And by then I'd built up a tolerance. - I didn't know. You always had the best comebacks. - Lots of practice. Anyway. You remember Rebecca? - Hm. Yeah. Cute. Not nice. - Mm-hmm. - Sucks. - Yeah, so first day of school, junior year, she walks up to me and she's like, "Hey Savannah, what happened?" And she was my friend so I smiled and made a joke at my own expense. I actually thought I looked good that day. I spent like an hour picking out that dress. (sighing) And then I spent hours hiding in the bathroom that day. And I don't think I even truly stopped. It's like I just let that simple comment just make its way in and I've just been trying to forget how ugly and self-conscious it made me feel for years. It's like I wanna be healthy. I feel better when I am. You know, no one wants to be uncomfortable or obese. Just, I just wanna be free to make a decision without considering the Rebeccas of the world first. It's pretty screwed up. And no one knew. I wish I would've told someone. I know that now. But our mom once did tell me, "Savannah, you don't have to perform for applause, we're not all entertainers. - She was smart. - She is. And I'm glad you're here for me to tell. And I'm glad I didn't do some of those stupid things I thought about back then. Because if I had, who would've been there to save your butt? - I know what it looks like, but I have fun with the popularity I have. It's nice having followers and people who want to hear what you have to say. - There's nothing wrong with that. Just don't slip into needing it. (soft music) - They're gone. - Yeah they are but you know you're not alone. I'm here. And I'm not going anywhere for a while. - I'm glad. Love you, sis. Serious. I've always admired your strength. - Really? (phone vibrating) - Get it. (phone vibrating) The guy. - Unknown caller. Can I? Okay. - Hello? - Hey. How are you? It's Danny. - You got a phone. - I did. It's date night, right? Or too soon or? Hello? - I'm here. I, I want to, but there was this accident when I got home this morning and my brother Wyatt needs me right now. - Is he okay? - He's good, they're releasing him tomorrow but- - I got people waiting for updates. Just go. - Yes. Date night. (chuckles) (upbeat music) Wyatt! - What? Nurses love it. - Okay. I'll call you in the morning after I have breakfast with my brother. - [Savannah] Bye. - Woo! (laughing) (soft music) - What? - Dustin almost drowned. - Well, did you? - Okay, Then we're all better now, right? - Dustin! What are you doing? I said I'd pay for it. - Hey, Danny. Hey, I have money. Hey, I can buy us breakfast. - What's that? - A package. I'm gonna drop it off after breakfast to take to my friends. - A package. Let me see. - Hey! Dumb ass! Don't touch the package. Dude, mind your own business. - Come, come on, Danny. Let's, let's go. - Me? - No, the seagull behind you. - [Dustin] Danny, stop! - Dude! What's your problem? - I called the police. - What? You did? Call 'em back. - Let's go, Danny. Here, take it back. - You just got your friend in a world of shit! - What are you doing? I told you to stop doing that. Not do that. - I need money too. - Not like that you don't. - You're just like mom. - What's that supposed to mean? I'm nothing like our mother. - Leave me alone. - Leave you alone? That crazy woman is the reason you're on the streets. I'm the only reason you're safe. Nobody else gives a shit, Dustin, nobody! I'm living like this because of you, but you won't let me help you. - It's that crazy woman's birthday tomorrow. I was trying to buy mom a present. Now I don't have one for her. Yeah. Thanks Danny. (soft music) (kids yelling and laughing) Mom used to bring us here all the time, remember? - Yeah. - You always saved me. I'm sorry. Molly said it was important for us to come. - When'd you talk to Molly? - Just a couple days ago. I used Scout's phone. - Scout has a phone? - Well, I used it without him noticing, so don't say anything, okay? - Yeah. I won't. (upbeat music) ♪ How long ♪ ♪ Do we have ♪ - What? - Pizza. Jade and I are going for pizza. - [Jade] Yeah, come. - Don't we ever eat healthy in this house? - [Jade] What? - I'm starting a diet. I need healthy food. - You're losing weight because of that guy? - No, I'm losing weight so I can scratch the middle of my back. And how do you know about- - I've seen you leave with him. Greta knows too. I told her. - I heard he's handsome. Oh, the mayor said it'll be taken care of tonight before 10:00 p.m. It sounded serious. - Thank you, Greta. - [Greta] What did I just get myself involved in? (phone ringing) - Hey. - [Danny] Hey. Hear me out. I don't want you to think I'm backing out. I have to take care of something tonight. It's unavoidable. - What's going on, Danny? I can hear it in your voice. (Danny sighing) - [Danny] If I tell you, you have to promise not to get involved. - Bullshit. I'm involved. I'm bringing down some drug dealers. Don't wait up. Oh, wait. Where are the ski masks? - Garage. - Okay. - They close at six. Nothing risky. Please. I don't want you getting hurt. You're just gonna be the lookout. Okay? - We walk in, take the cash, destroy the drugs, we leave. Easy peasy. - No, I didn't agree to that. - Oh, wait. Hey, hey, sorry. I'm sorry to bother you, but, um, can you help me? I was, I really hurt myself. I was jogging and I just like- - What'd you do? - I, I don't know. I just, I really hurt myself. - Okay. Let me... I'll bring you some ice. - Thank you. But, um, can I just borrow your phone actually? I just, I just don't think I'm gonna make it home like this. - Well, I can take you home. - No, just your phone please. - Yeah, sure. - I really appreciate it. - Wait! What are you doing?! That's not cool! I was helping you! - [Savannah] Cameras. - There's two. - Yeah. We're going back inside. I'll hurt you, but I don't have to. (suspenseful music) - I know where the money is. No worries, dude. We're cool. Whatever you need. This shit-hole ain't worth it. - [Danny] Talk to anyone and our friends will be visiting your home. - I won't. I swear. - Who else is here? - No one. - Where are the drugs? - Please, man. They'll kill me. (suspenseful music) - [Savannah] For your phone. Sorry about that. All right. We'll break the door lock. They'll think we broke in. Okay? You won't tell our secret. We won't tell yours. - Can I get one more? - Don't get greedy. Where are the drugs? - I swear I don't know. - Okay. I'm gonna get a diet cola. - Don't move. (dramatic music) - They made me. - Why aren't you bleeding? They'll deal with you later. (gun fires) (man groaning) - Thank you. Get up! Get up! Move! Let's go! Move! - Get over there! - The safe in the office. - Combination. - I'll tell you. If she climbs on top of me like you did. That's kind of nice. Oh! - My brother almost died last night because of losers like you! - Shoot me, but please, spare me to the sermon. - Tape him up. Hands and feet quickly. - [Man] All of you are dead. - The combination. - Stop. Give it to me. This isn't you. I got you. (dramatic music) Say good night. - Okay, okay, okay. Eight, zero, five, eight, six. Doesn't matter. They're gonna kill me and all of you. - [Operator] Hello, 911. What's your emergency? - I dialed 911. We should open that and leave. (dramatic music) Guess I quit. - All right. Okay. We're going to the hospital, okay? - Okay. Sounds good. (Savannah sighing) Okay God. I've gone off the deep end I admit, but I believe you brought Danny into my life, (sighing) so please heal him, okay? Just let him be all right. (soft music) I know it's crazy, but I really think I love him and not because he's literally the first guy that's ever treated me like this, but because my heart, it knows. Okay. So please, God, please. - Well, that's good to hear. - Dr. Conrad, this is Savannah. The woman that saved my life tonight. Savannah, this is Dr. Conrad. - I've been Danny's cardiologist since well, Dr. Harris handed your case over to me, that was like 14, 15 years ago. - And a great friend of the family. I'm sure you now have many questions. - Yes. It's very nice to meet you. What a relief. Um, so how's he doing? - Well, his heart- - She means the laceration. - Either one, actually. - He's lucky. A quarter inch or so and it would be more than just stitches. Well, I'll let you two get back to your dinner plans. It was wonderful to meet you, Savannah. Tell this one to take it easy. And his heart could use rest. Oh, and Danny, stop running with knives on wet kitchen floors. - You good? - I'm great. Sore. - I think I need some answers now, Danny. - Wanna come to a FATAL group with me tonight? - What's a FATAL group? - This just breaking. We have our very own Natalie Lewis from the Eye On You News special reporting team out in Anaheim with a story that seemingly keeps getting stranger by the hour. Natalie, what do you have for us? - It's starting to look like Orange County has its very own vigilante on the loose and they may be robbing from the crooks to give to the poor. Sir, come here for a second. How much money do you have there? - I have a lot of money here. Look, a lot of money. - And what are you gonna do with all that new found cash? - I'm might give it to my granddaughter. And, and, and stay in the hotel for a whole week if I can. - Best of luck to you, sir. - That's what I wanna do. Yeah. - Yes. Thank you so much. - Yeah. Yeah. - But unlike yesterday's food drive, this one had a more deadly outcome. A body was found with multiple gunshot wounds according to police. And for the second day in a row, investigators are reporting that this could very well- (people chattering) - So many choices. Hmm. - Danny's here. Hi, Danny. Oh, how sad. I wonder what she's dying from. - I don't think she's dying, but this meeting just got longer. - Rickey. - So, bring all your dates to a, what do you call it, a fatalist group? - I guess I would, but never been on a real date before. - Oh, I know him. He doesn't like me. Um. - I'm living, Dan. Great! - We're not fatalists. Most of us don't even believe in fatalism. - You know all these people? - We help each other. The group's actually called FATAL. It's an acronym, Fighting Against a Terminally Altered Life. - A group I obviously needed to attend. Look, I appreciate it but you don't need to fix me. - I know. - Well, they admire you. - I admire them. They're tough. - Okay, everyone, before we get going tonight, Danny has brought a friend. Her name is Savannah. - Hi, Savannah. - Hi, Savannah. - And apparently she has brought a gift for you all. - Remember not the clinicians. ♪ You be Robinhood ♪ ♪ I'll be Maid Marian ♪ ♪ And maybe we can make some difference ♪ ♪ May not be the brightest idea you've had tonight ♪ ♪ But hey, at least we're doing something ♪ - Oh wow, thank you. - Oh my gosh, thank you so much. - Oh. - Thanks. - Wow. - That was absolutely, hands down, the most fun I've ever had. (chuckles) - If you were running for office, they'd all vote for you. (all laughing) - Who is that? - She is like a sister to me. - Okay, okay. Um, let's get started please. My name is Dr. Bernadette Krause. I'm your supervising clinical... Oh, and this is interning psychologist and resident PhD. - My name is Emery as most of you know, emotional support liaison and not in need of pontificating my credentials at the start of each meeting. - Yes. - Hi, everyone. - Hi. - Hi, Emery. - When you're coming here on time. - Don't start with me. - Hmm. - Good to see you all again. Would've been a dead room otherwise. (group chuckling) - Yes. Denial. - [All] Anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance and whatever else gets me by. - This is good. - Um, sadly, Carrie won't be joining us anymore. - She died? - No, Tyler. She simply moved to Cancun. - Oh. - You may have wanted to lead with that given the group condition. - I agree with Emery. That didn't make me feel good. - It was insensitive. - Well, maybe you're being too sensitive, Marisa. - I don't think so. Expressing their feelings is why they're here. - Ugh. Get off me. Somebody's cranky and perhaps needs to find some decaf or a new group. - Danny hired me. Not you. I've almost got my hours and then you can leave. Mm, we'll see about that. - They really don't work well together. - Yeah. I'm getting that. You hired her. - Yes. She's actually pretty nice. - Why don't we go around the room and in a word or two say how you're feeling today or even this past week. - I'm tired. (solemn music) - Confused. - Left out. - Scared. - Angry. - Uh, sad. - Emotional. - Sick. - Invisible. - Um. Stuck. I guess. - Dizzy lately. - Wait. - Okay. One more time around the room. Let's just get it out. - Let's get past the denial, people. - I'm dying. - I'm dying. - I'm dying. - I'm dying. - I'm dying. - I'm dying. - I'm dying. - I'm fine. (group laughing) - I'm gonna go the bathroom for a second. - [Dr.] Okay. Now I wanna hear who's living in the moment, who's taking life back. (Savannah vomiting) (toilet flushing) (upbeat music) - Hello. My name is Frank. I'm the guy that prays for everyone here. I've seen lots of miracles. If you don't mind me asking, how can I pray for you? What are you dying of? Most of us have different types of cancer. - I'm so sorry to hear that, Frank. I'm, I'm, I'm not dying. I'm not sick. - You don't have to be sorry for living. Praise God. That's great news. Well, I'll let you get back to Danny. He's a good Christian man. He makes all this happen. It's nice of you to be there to support him in his last days. He deserves it. - Yes, it was very nice to meet you, Frank. - Bye, bye. (solemn music) - I'm very proud of this group. - Let's huddle up. - So how's your side? - A little sore, but good. - How's your heart? - Fine. - Good. So did you mean it, about not being on a date before? Or did you just say that to make me feel better about myself? - You just found out I'm dying and you're concerned about my dating resume? - Well, are you dying? - No. I've had a heart thing since I was 12 called Eisenmenger syndrome. They've been counting me out since I was a kid. And here I am. You wanna see my scar? - I'm not blind, Danny. The parking lot, the house we trashed, I saw you, but you don't seem all that concerned about it so should I be? - No. - I'm not a doctor so I don't know if you're being honest or just being a man, but I'm starting to have feelings for you. And I'm not needy. I don't need you to say things to protect me or make me feel better. I just want the truth. - I'm gonna be really honest with you. Dying or not, I don't have a lot of time to waste and I haven't been this happy maybe ever. And I want you to be happy, really happy. If I can make you feel better the rest of your life I will, but I don't have time to treat you like porcelain or cater to you more insecure qualities. - Hmm. - I'm trying not to get punched. - Yeah. So no, you don't have to worry about that. I didn't tell you to make you feel better, told you because it's true. My heart has never been more full. You're welcome to Google it. Savannah, in the past 24 hours, you have aimed a gun at a giant and pistol whipped a drug dealer. I think you can take it. - Thank you. (chuckles) - And while we're on the subject, I didn't bring you here to fix you. I invited you because I needed you to know the truth before I take you out on our first real date. I've never gone out with anyone else I felt needed to know. - Why me? I know, insecure, but still answer please. - So I could stop fighting the urge to fall in love with you. I wanna let you in if that's what you want. - Where and when are you taking me on this elusive date you keep talking about? Do you live somewhere? Like, do you have family members? Or why do you have so many friends? It's such a mystery. - I don't want to tell you. I'll show you. - Oh my gosh. I feel like I'm in the film "Christmas Carol." Which ghost are you? Ghost of Christmas past, future, or I'll show you? - Run. - Wait. (laughing) Why are we running? - I'll show you! (laughing) - The stars are so bright. Why are we here? Is this where Dustin lives or? - We can go. - No, no, I, I, I like it here. Seems oddly safe for some reason. It's like peaceful. - I worry about him. He's been living out here for about six months. He can't be left alone and he won't stay home. He doesn't like people telling him what to do. - Ah, he's the one that can't be forced. - He won't let me help him. Savannah. He knows the guy that we hurt tonight. And I'm afraid that they'll come for him. Tonight was a lot and I'm sorry I got you involved. - You're wrong, Danny. Okay? I like the person I became tonight better than who I was. I'm, I'm tired of being a coward and I loved helping. I mean, did you see their faces when we gave them the money? It was like seeing the value in something for the first time. It was like opening possibilities. I just, I just, I wanna feel like that every day. - Okay. Me too. But we don't have to become like them to do it. - I wanna see a scar. - Really? (soft music) - Can I? It's real. You know, this all seems so fast maybe. I mean, I'm not sure what's, what's real. - I didn't bring you into my life to get you hurt. I didn't intend for it to go this way. - No. - I'm a grown woman. Okay? And I'm finally awake. Okay, you helped me with that. It's okay. - Wait here. - What? - Okay. Close your eyes. - Uh. Okay. - Keep your eyes closed. - What are you doing? I... Okay, they're closed. - Eyes closed. - Okay. Okay. - Okay. Um. - Okay, you can open them. Date night. - Uh. Thank you. (chuckling) Mm. They're beautiful. - Not exactly how I'd planned, but... - Always wonder what that would be like. - And? - It was pretty good. (chuckling) (soft music) Oh. Okay. (chuckles) ♪ Bags are packed are you ready to go ♪ ♪ This time tomorrow we'll be on the road ♪ ♪ Riding with you in the sunnier days ♪ ♪ I wouldn't want it any other way ♪ - Danny. I wanna see where you live. I wanna meet your family. and I'm just gonna keep asking and asking. - You don't. Eventually. Maybe. - No, I want this to be real. - You're sure? This isn't the part where I tell you too much and you leave? - You don't scare me. - Promise? - Promise. (chuckles) ♪ Taking the good with the ups and downs ♪ - Wait here. - Where are you going? Oh, you're gonna show me. I know. - They're not involved. We know who they are. Have you been able to locate them? Do you even know if they're still in the state? Didn't think so. We know who they are now. Let me find out where they're at. I'm here. I don't care. A couple of upstanding social-tard parasites got it handed to them for change. And I'm supposed to cry? So what? We're close to catching the real bad guys here. Hold off. (phone beeps) (soft music) Hey Danny. So I'm upping my game. Why doesn't a seagull live by the bay? Because then he'd be called a bagel. I take, I can't take credit for that one. - Who are you? - I'm the scout. I'll be here all week. - Yeah. Not funny as usual. Who are you? - Your herd. Nobody sleeps around here. Look. I'm not after you or your brother. You've been nice to me. I like you guys. - Why are you here? - Because a man and his wife were murdered. She was raped and tortured before they did her the favor of cutting her throat. The FBI thinks your brother was there. Were you there that night too? - Leave. - Your brother Dustin knows where they are. Look. I'm not after you or- - You're gonna get my brother hurt. We didn't do anything wrong. - I don't think you did, but you and your girl. Savannah is it? Have been doing an awful lot of photo bombing lately. Want to see? Now, I don't care about that, but they're an awful lot of people that do on both sides. Let me help you fix it. Please. Where are they? - Were you there, Danny? - I can't think. - Danny! - Uh, so if you look over here to the right, uh, you'll see the hotel that I sleep in. I didn't get a chance to tidy up before I showed you, uh, because detective- - Agent. Ian Mesa. - Uh, Agent Mesa said he had some photos. - I heard everything. (panting) Were you? (Danny sobbing) - Yes, I was there. - Oh my God. Okay. Okay. I have to go. I'm not running away. Okay? I just, I just need to clear my head, all right? - You want her back? Let's find her parent's killers. I don't know. I'm sorry if I let you down! Damn it! Rule number one. Never get attached. (fire crackling) - So this is how you clear your head? - Glad you came. I'm not upset, just scared and confused. - Your fingerprints on this? - Yes. (soft music) Did you see it? My parents get killed. - I assume you got all the people out. - Of course I did. I made the call. Well, Greta did. I'm not crazy, you know? - That's good. - Mm-hmm. I can finally put a check in that box, mark it off my list. - Answer the question. - No. But I was there. I saw the men who did it, which is probably why the agent's there, why they're watching us. They were bothering your parents when I walked by. - You're always helping people. Why didn't you stop to help them? - Savannah, nothing I'm gonna say is gonna- - Please. - I went into the bathroom, looking for Dustin. When I came out, your father had just been stabbed and was on the ground. Your mother was already gone. I should've... I want so badly to fix this. I wish I would've paid closer attention or yelled at them or... But I didn't. I didn't freeze this time. Savannah, your dad, he, he looked like he had it under control. - Yeah. That's my dad. - I'm so sorry. - You're not to blame. Okay? I'm not blaming you. I'm not blaming you. - I've tried to find them. And every day I've sworn to make it up to you. - You don't owe me that. You were worried about your brother. - I'm gonna fix this. - Is that what this is? Is that what we're doing? Danny? - I'm not a pity date, remember? Savannah, you never needed saving. I did. - We should probably stop talking and maybe go. I have another house to burn down before I go to bed. - You know, Agent Mesa probably has pictures of this. - I'm joking. It's too close to the other houses. I don't know how I feel about you watching me without me knowing all these weeks. - I'm not a stalker. - And I'm not a pyro. (Greta laughing) - Jade, you can live here as long as you like. Your parents are negligent. - Well, the mayor called, he asked me to ask you, if you had a bonfire tonight. - You can tell him yes and he's lucky it wasn't bigger. They need to do more. - Bonfires are nice. Hey, did you hear about the vigilantes, they were helping the poor? They struck like 20 times in the past two days. There's bodies everywhere. - Mm-hmm. - Said you wanted to meet the family. - It's big. - You don't have to do this. - They say that in every movie. Of course I do. - Ah! Ducky! - Oh! Hey kid. - My brothers! And a stranger. - This is my girlfriend, Savannah. - Hi. Nice to, ooh! - I'm Molly. I didn't think you'd come. - Dust said it was important to you. - Thanks. I really appreciate it. - Uh? Where's Mom? - In her room. All morning. She's nervous. - Hmm. Great. The less I have to- - You should listen to her. Should Savannah be here? - Oh, I don't have to be. It's like a family thing. I understand. - She's staying. - Are you sure? - Are you sure? Danny? Oh my. - The beast, making her appearance. (all laughing) (soft music) - Please don't call me that. Dustin, please. For Mom, don't sit there in those filthy clothes. I'm sorry. I just, you know how I am. - If he gets up, we leave. - That old hat. I haven't seen that ugly thing since your father died. - Shut up about the hat. - He wore it everywhere. - You're pushing your luck, Mother. - Hello, boys. - It's a beautiful dress. - It's my birthday. - Same as my bird, Chubby. - Have you showered? - I did. Can you loan me some money? - No. - Okay. I want a piece of candy then. - Please. - What do you want? - Peace. I'm sorry for everything that I've done and I wanna make amends. I want to make it up to you, to all of you. Hello. - Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Savannah. - Did I miss anything? - Thank you, Mom. Can I move back in? - Yes, but with certain conditions, but yes, that's part of the forgiveness part of course. - No, you realize this is my house. Dad left it to me. You're a squatter here. (mother laughing) - He didn't mean to do that. I'm, I was his wife. - Yeah. He drank himself to death because of you. - Danny. - Mom said sorry. - I thought- - What? We just embrace you from afar and say all is forgiven? Cookie? - No, I'm a really messy cookie eater. - I thought you'd be grateful. - Well, Katie, maybe it's hard for someone to accept the care from the person causing the injury. - I never laid a hand on you children. - You were afraid of our germs. - You never hugged us either. - My son obviously values you. So what's your opinion, Savannah? Are you homeless too? - Okay. That's enough. - Danny. - This isn't done yet. We shouldn't leave. Please. If this were any of my business, I might have an opinion, but thankfully it's not so I don't. Oh and no. I'm just dealing with a broken heart over the brutal murder of my parents by evil transients. It's tough out there. - You let your son live on the street while you enjoyed the comforts of my home. - I didn't tell you to leave! You're living like a bum on the streets of your own free will! - I meant Dustin! I've been camping with my brother, an extended vacation, while I figure things out. Takes me a while, six months, but I've got the solution. We're moving back in and you're leaving. Now, I'll show you more compassion than you ever showed the three of us. I'll buy your own house so you can live alone in your spotless, sanitized little world. But after that, you're on your own. Thank you for making this happen. I love you, sis. - Love you too. - Bye mom. - Bye Dusty. - [Dustin] I'll visit you. - You always were the frail one. - I understand you struggle with mental illness. It's colored our entire lives. You can't help it, but that never excused your lack of love. That's all you. - Mrs. Scott, Danny is the strongest man I know. So with all due respect, you couldn't be more wrong. So good day to you. (soft music) (birds chirping) - You sleeping? - Mm-hmm. - Yet so capable of answering me. - I always love the breeze. It reminds me of something. How did you find this place? - I didn't. It found me. (Savannah laughing) - Oh my gosh. Look at my man. Trying to be all deep. That was so cheesy. - Kind of cute though. Right? - I love you. - I'd love to gain feeling back in my left leg. It's been asleep for like the past hour. - Shut up. - I'm kidding. Geez. - Okay, so what I just heard was, hey, your size triple X beast leg is cutting my circulation. Kindly get a crane and remove it so I can regain feeling in my lower extremities. I think you just called me fat, which is sad because I'm not gonna diet. And I'm not changing for no man. No man. What you see is what you get until your last breath. Is that okay? (soft music) You're looking at me. - Yeah. (Savannah chuckles) ♪ We're more alive and beautiful than I imagined ♪ - I'm so blessed.
