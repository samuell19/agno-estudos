Nobita! I've told you about it, but why did it become like this? Your teacher called and I was so embarassed Also, what is this? Not only the test paper was fully blank, you even doodled on it! It's not just any doodle, it's a pegasus Pegasus? This is what happens when you always day-dream. From today onwards, you are grounded! No more afternoon nap, and no TV and manga either! Why? Understand? I cannot be patient anymore today! I'm getting sick of being scolded at school and at home too! I've made up my mind! I will run away from home! Emm .. What is "er ..."? Even if you stop me, I won't change my mind! I will not stop you because you will be back soon enough Don't make a fool of me! This time I will plan it well Plan? Which one? I've been thinking about it long enough I want to live by my will... without depending on anyone What does it take to survive? There are three main things... Clothing, Food, Shelter! Sometimes, your thoughts are illogical Right? So lend me your 'Dress Up Camera' 'Gourmet Table Cloth' and 'Camping Capsule'! Why? Do you still want to rely on my tools? - We are friends, right? - Stop it... - This is still being dependent on someone - Don't be so harsh This is the first step towards my freedom You even failed at the first step Dodo... DORAEMOOOOOONNN!!! What's the commotion? For a long time, I'm indebted to you You are not studying, but playing instead? Then, I'm not cooking you any dinner I'm not coming back anymore! Nobita! What is this? Well... Hello! Nobita... Welcome to my home! I've moved here after running away from home I can freely become a couch potato without having to go to school Stop behaving like that, Nobita You have not even succeeded even once How many hours this time? Wait a minute! Everyone makes a fool of me Let them be, it's time for my afternoon nap... What's the matter? Stop hitting my home! I should be the one asking! Why is this thing on my land? Even a space like this have an owner? Of course! Dear Shizuka, I've decided to start my new life at the back of the hill Of course you can come whenever you're free... It hurts This is a private property. Evacuate immediately Oh, my... Wow, you came back even faster than before I'm not coming back yet Hey, lend me the Anywhere Door You want to live by your own will without depending on anyone, right? Please! This will be the last Do you know where you're going? Yes. I'll write you a letter later! Take care This village is abandoned because it's too backward Nobody will complain about me here This is not a joke! You want me to watch the shop and mow the lawn... I'm not slave, okay? You can say that after really working like a slave! I hate you, mom! Takeshi! I can't take it anymore! I want to run away from home! - Giant! - Suneo? - Do you see Nobita? - Do you know where is Nobita? Don't tell me... You have also run away from home? - Giant! - We are soul mates! My mom wanted me to learn many things From English to Chinese to French I understand you! It's horrible having such parents! I know you'll say that! Did you guys see Nobita? Shizuka... Don't tell me that you have ran away from home too? Not that I have run away from home, but... My mom's expectation put pressure on me Everyone is having problems of their own - Anyway, let's run away together and search for Nobita - Okay... What have you done? - The village has sank to the bottom of the dam - We have to close this door! Pass Loop! You've flooded the room! Is there any uninhabited place that I can live in? There's no such place. Other than private property, the rest belongs to the government Well, take out the Ground Making Machine! I can't make a tool without permission Just give up already. It's impossible for you to run away from home I will help you pass the test together No! I still want to run away! You are so stubborn! It's okay! I will not ask anything from you anymore! Oh, my He's not even listening to me Doraemon Look A mouse! This is not a mouse, it's a hamster Whatever it is, take it out immediately! It can't be helped I need to take care of the hamster while my boss goes on a family vacation Who is more important, your boss or me? - Don't say anything unreasonable - I'm scared I found him! Nobita! - You guys... - How are you right now? You borrowed pretty interesting tools, didn't you? We want to join you too! About that... You don't like it? You want to keep it for yourself! Nobita is the worst! - That's not it! - Traitor Nobita! It's not like that! Doraemon I want to run away from home too! When it comes to this, land becomes even a bigger problem Every nook and cranny in Japan already belongs to somebody Don't you think that it's kind of weird? Generally, the land already exists since the Earth was born 4.6 billion years ago, right? Then human beings who came later cut it into pieces without permission! Absolutely weird! That means they did it on a first-some-first-served basis! First-come-first-served That's right! We return to the time when there were no humans There was once a time when nobody inhabited Japan, right? If we return to that time, the entire Japan will belong to us! That's it! - Okay, since the room are all tidy... - Cut it out... - Hurry up - Don't push! We ran away from home! Ran away from home! This is the ultimate running away from home! Because this is totally reckless! Which era do you wish to go? To a long ago place To the time when no humans existed in Japan There's no input of information about a place like that You're a robot from the future, aren't you? I'm just a cheap robot by the way Don't be so sensitive When a fossil and a polished stone tool are checked, they seem to exist before 30 thousand years ago The evidence is not too accurate and humans might exist even earlier than that Exactly Our neighbour, China is also 80 thousand years old... Is there anything suspicious? What is it... What happened? It's flunked! Emergency... Space-time turbulence occured! Space-time turbulence? If we fall, there's no way to return! Everybody, hold on tight! We are going on full speed! It's useless! It's flunked! Oh, no! The turbo has expired! We survived the space-time turbulence! Great... Please decide your destination as soon as possible Is it okay if we double the 30 thousand years making it 60 thousand years? For safety reasons, it's better if we just add 10 thousand years more It's been decided! Go to Japan 70 thousand years ago! This is it! Amazing! It's a beautiful green land The air tastes so fresh So vast This is the Japan that belongs to us only! Okay! Let's make our paradise here! Great! What are you doing? We don't know what the animals here are capable of doing So I hid the Time Machine What is that? This is Donbura Powder When it is sprinkled around us, the surrounding will become like water Look Don't you guys feel cold? Of course Somehow, I'm trembling It's true, because 70 thousand years ago was the fourth stage of Ice Age So the weather must be terribly cold What is Ice Age? A time when the ice in ocean becomes larger and the Earth became extremely cold I don't fancy a cold paradise! Don't worry, we'll do something about it later What kind of world do we want to build here? You guys can give me some ideas about it - I want an afternoon-nap hotel! - Game centre! - Concert hall! You guys lack ambition How about a flower garden beside the lake? That's good - And a big rainbow up in this large sky - Is it possible to have aurora at night? - Of course It's boring Let's go! Wait! Let's go look for more thrilling adventure Yes! Wild and primitive! Giant, let me take a picture of you Sure? Make me look cool, okay? I wonder if it will look cool Ready? Smile... What? Giant! Behind you... Behind? It's a bison! Oh, no... - Help... - Oh no... This is what happens when you wander around freely! Toreador! - Great! - It's like a bullfighter show! It will bring the bison to a faraway place Prehistoric Set! This is climate clothes that will suit any kind of climate, regardless if it's cold or vice versa That's right. Let's warm up! This spear is amazingly light Seems like it can't be used to hunt What is this button? It's a shock stick It can even stun an elephant You should have said it earlier... Okay, from now on, we'll stay here But first, we need to make a place to stay A home From here to here is my land! - Suneo is playing dirty! - Unfair! Thousand square meters over here is mine! Mine is 10 thousand square metres from here! They are so pathetic... Why did we come here in the first place? It's because there are lots of land Shame on me This side is good. Southeast of the cliff with exposure to the sun is even better Let's dig a hole here. It may seem like the Stone Age Digging? It's so tiring... Practical Digger! We can use this If we use this digger, digging a hard stone is as easy as digging a tofu Besides, there are various types to try Sounds interesting! I want to try it too! Not fair! That's mine! Give it to me! They are difficult anywhere and everywhere... Leave the heavy labour to me! No objection! You excel in quarrelling... I just want to appoint you as the Minister of Development My pleasure Next is Garden Cylinder! There are a lot of seeds to grow a garden in this small cylinder shape! Let me do that Shizuka is the Minister of Environment - I want it too! - What position comes after this? Minister of Agriculture Manage the Farm Restaurant! Don't appoint the job to Nobita Every year, you just let the morning glory dry out and die, right? I want to be a minister too! Oh, yes... We might feel very lonely in this big, big world But we can make a pet to accompany us Pet? Animal Genetic Ampoule and Cloning Eggs! Just inject the liquid inside the ampoule into the egg Even you can do it What minister is this? I think it's the Minister of Pets I'm not motivated at all A river Just the right place to hatch the eggs Minister of Pets? Even Doraemon makes fun of me! These two trees are entangled Oh, that's right! I'll give them a surprise by using this! Running away from home? I have a memory about it too Dear... Don't worry They will sure come home after dark You're always in the cage. It must be hard to breathe, right? Hey, Minister of Environment Doraemon How is the seeding progress? I've almost done sprinkling it. They seem to sprout so quickly I hope the rain will fall on this area soon If that so... RC Rains Cloud! It can send down the amount of rain needed whenever you fancy Impressive! Also, there is already fertilizer in the rain Thanks! I'll take good care of it! You're very dependable Hey, Doraemon! That's Minister of Agriculture's voice What a stunning Farm Restaurant This is weird. Although I have sprinkled various types of seeds, only one type of strange leaf has grown That's good. It will grow even faster if there is plenty of sunlight RC Sun! Use it with the combination of Shizuka's RC Rains Cloud, okay? Okay! How is the condition of the Minster of Development? Oh? Running smoothly Sorry... I've almost finished digging the cave Great! Ground Water Pipe! When installed, it will find it's way to the water source It will also extend anywhere. I also have a pipe to find a gas source Let me install it! Right, the problem with Minister of Pets is... No! Come back here! The egg is flying Yes! A pegasus is born! I'm such a genius for mixing the swan and the horse ampoules together! A combination of eagle and lion formed a griffin. A dragon is produced from combining a crocodile, deer and bat! Pega, Gris and Draco. From now on, I'm your mother! Nobita! Doraemon! Hurry, hide in here! Don't come out until I say so, understand? Where is it? What kind of animal did you make? A dog? A cat? I fell asleep As expected. You are totally like that! You must be punished! You better resign right now! Please calm down! No... What now? I am really undependable I know but please do it seriously Universal Pet Growth! If the egg hatches, feed them with this Okay It's almost meal time. When you're done, you can return to the cave This is not good. I've told you guys not to come out without my permission Eat well so you can become bigger You eat too fast. I have a lot of it, so don't worry I'm feeling hungry too I think this Katsudon is done I knew it! It's just a radish! You'll see - It's so fragrant - Shizuka Let's rest and eat some food! I'll come in a bit! Take a look. The house is done - Great! - It's huge! The individual room is at the back. There is a kitchen and a balcony too! - Indeed, Giant! - It looks very comfortable to live in, right? Okay, everybody, let's eat How do we eat radish like this? I have ordered Katsudon! I feel like eating spaghetti We are not eating like this. You need to open it from here It look delicious! Mine too! Thanks for the food! Suneo, this is really delicious! Really? I should have become a farmer already Smells good I'm so hungry! You're late So? What kind of pet did you make? Uh, it's a... You must have fallen asleep, didn't you? So rude! I'm not sleeping all the time, you know? So, what have you done? I just dozed off Thanks for the food! Delicious! This is real freedom - It's freedom... - The best freedom ever! All our problems seem to just fade away when we are surrounded by such beautiful nature But it would be great if we went home now Me too! I have been thinking about it At this moment, we might not be yelled at anymore! I don't want to! After all the struggles to find freedom, only must I go home? It's okay if I'm here alone! But our moms would definitely be worried by now That's right. Don't be stubborn, let's go home Shut up! We'll still run away from home! Just take it as a little break After all, we can always come here again when we wanted to! Good. If it's so, then yes! - Promise? We have this secret place just for us. I will hit you hard if you reveal it to your parents or anyone at school! - Okay... Swear it to the stone spear! Actually, what made me run away from home in the first place? - Bye - See you tomorrow - Good night - Good night Doraemon, come on out - No, I'm afraid of the hamster! - It's not dangerous Stop it! Where did you go until this hour? Wash your hands and go eat, hurry - I'll clean it up if you don't want to eat! - I'll eat... Strange. Mama did not scold him this time... A wolf? Impossible I felt terrible yesterday. If Jaiko didn't open the door, I'm sure I'd need to stay outside all night Me too.. A child who does not stick to a curfew is not considered as a parent's child We had a discussion But somehow I still need to read a French book How about you Nobita? Me? I... Whatever it is, problems arise because we run away the whole day. What about we run away for like 3 hours a day? It won't raise the alarm, right? Can we still call that a runaway? As long as it does not cause a commotion True I'm home What happened? That thing ate all of my dorayakis! What thing? That hamster ate all of my dorayakis! I'll settle it! Cut it out! He's not home yet? - But his bag is here - Excuse us Whatever. I want to change my clothes Right No! Don't change it here! Where can I change my clothes then? Outside, okay? It's more dangerous outside There's someone in the closet! - What? - Really? Maybe it's Doraemon? - Suneo, open it! - What? This boy... I'll finish you up! Wait! Attack him, Giant! Let me go! For the mercy of a cat! What happened? How dare you tell our secret to a guy like him? I don't even know him! - Don't play dumb! - I'm not playing dumb! It's too loud - Mama! - Let's leave before more trouble occurs This is bad! Who are you, by the way? Nobita? I've told you, I don't know him! Liar! If that is so, why is he wearing like that? He attacked me all out of a sudden! Ouch A stone spear? Maybe this kid is a real prehistoric man... A real prehistoric man? But it's strange! Why is he in 21st century Tokyo if he is a prehistoric man? Maybe because of that... Because of what? The space-time turbulence! Although it is rare, the distortion of the space-time formed a pitfall which looks like a so-called black hole If anyone is swallowed by this hole, they will disappear from their original world Disappeared from Earth? I've never heard of such a thing before Have you ever heard about spirited away? It's an old Japanese legend The incidence about the sudden disappearance of people all over the world So, this kid was also from a primitive era? Probably I'm disappointed... 70 thousand years ago, Japan was already inhabited by human I'm not still sure about that I need to know for sure when and where this kid came from Nobita and I will run the investigation. Giant and Suneo, go search if there are any humans living nearby Leave it to us! Okay! Shizuka please take care of this kid! Understood! Space-time Research Counter! I'll float this observation ball in a time hole and look for a mark of space-time via wave motion Wave Motion? Space-time disorder, which is invisible to the eyes I sent it up until yesterday. The data will come at once This is it! Let's follow this wave Where does it start? And where does it lead to? It's totally incomprehensible How about my pets' development? Pega? Gris? Draco? Where are you guys? Come out now! Who is it? Who's there? You guys! You're all grown up! You guys still remember me! You want me to have this? - Oh, I know! Let's go! Catch! - Oh no! Awesome! Nice catch, Gris! Look look, Giant! A flock of ibis! Oh! So wonderful! In the 20th century, ibis is extinct Poor birds... A bad dream? Seems like having a really bad one... Thank God, he's awake! Don't move! Don't be afraid! No one is going to hurt you here Your injury hasn't healed yet You need to sleep and rest quietly Wait for a while! Here, drink this warm soup You must be starving Here, have a second helping You will be able to recover faster if you eat more and rest well Stop that, Giant! Let's compete and see who can hold their breathe longer under water - Bring it on! - One, two, begin! Hey, stop cheating! Huh? Which means that just now... Giant... Giant! Yes! I won! This is not the time to talk about that! It's a...It's... It's a giant salamander! - It's huge! - We're going to be eaten! No, it's over! A griffin and a dragon? - What's happening? - Hey! Nobita? Everyone! We have a serious problem! Doraemon! Look, the boy has fully recovered That's great Rather than that, I discovered something big! I discovered something shocking from the results of the investigation! Doraemon! What's that? I'm back! These are the pets I created What do you think? Great, right? Wow, I'm impressed Lovely Yes. I found out where you came from The time-space distortion that sucked this boy was West 31 degrees 7 points, East 118 degrees 2 points Even if you made such comments... We won't undestand In 21st century language, it means somewhere near Dao in mainland China China? Soyu Flavoured Translator Konyaku! Please tell us everything about yourself Do you undertand what I'm saying? My name is Kukuru I am the son of Tajikara and Koiyame from the Hikari tribe I was sucked into a hole in the sky upon reaching the village It's the time-space distortion Was anyone else sucked into the hole? Your family or the other villagers? No, they were taken away by the Kurayami tribe! Kurayami tribe? Our tribe has been a target since the long time ago They will continue to chase after us no matter where we run to What happens to those that have been attacked and taken? I don't know. It seems that they will be taken to the North... what happens after that... Why don't you fight those crazy loons? Giant, it's the Kurayami tribe We can't win even if we fight! They have a strong ally The Immortal Spiritual King Gigazombie! - Gigazombie? - Immortal Spiritual King? What's that? Don't tell me it's a ghost? It's like a witch doctor, right? The people from the olden days believed that there are spirits living in each and everything in the world That's why those who can chant spells to soothe the spirits are feared and respected What? It's only superstition People from the olden days didn't know anything Don't worry, Kukuru! We do not fear this fraudster That's right, we have this thing called science and civilization This isn't fake! There's no human who can match against Gigazombie's magical powers in this world! So? Are you just going to continue to be depressed? Is it okay to not save your parents? Of course! I'm going to go save my parents Yes! It that's the case, leave it to us We love trills and adventures We can help Okay! It's decided then We will go to mainland China tomorrow to save those who have been captured by the Kurayami tribe Yes! It's me, me! You're still awake? The Gigazombie might come There's no way he will come! Do you know how far it is from here to China? It will be a difficult journey tomorrow If you don't get some sleep, let's go to my room I will stay here Fine, if you say so... Gigazombie Wait, Kukuru! Please don't be reckless! What's this early in the morning? Kukuru wants to go to China alone! You fool! You still don't believe us? The enemy is the ruthless Kurayami tribe and Gigazombie! There's no way to come back alive! You guys are good people... That's why...all the more... Here. Put this on your head On my head? Yes, just do it I flew in the sky I ordered the wind spirits to make you fly Yes... This person is the almighty witch doctor, Dorazombie The fire spirits as well as the water spirits listen to Dorazombie With this, you feel at ease to leave it to us? - Lord Dorazombie! - Stop it, I'm embarrassed What happened? Everyone, are you ready? - Let's go to mainland China! - Yes! Let's go! Here comes the knight with the white horse! Nobita is trying to act cool Can't be helped since he is the Minister of Pets I got it! Stop getting jealous Gris, I know it's going to be a long journey, but please take care of me The distance to China's Heshen, Anchi Province, is over 2,000 kilometers At this rate, we should be able to arrive at our destination in the evening But, there's a wide sea between Japan and China, right? If Draco and the rest get tired in the middle of the journey... No worries. I took a satellite picture before we begin our journey, just to be safe. Here you go! Japan is joined to the mainland! It is the Ice Age now. The ice will increase, whereas the water will decrease when the Earth gets cold When the water decreases, the sea level will drop and the land area will increase Which means we can land and rest at any time We are going out to the sea and keep to the seaside and proceed west! Yes! I can see a big mountain ahead Don't tell me that is... - It's Mount Fuji! - It's magnificent! Mount Fuji was formed approximately 100,000 years ago It was around this time. Let's have lunch here! Lunch is hamburger, potatoes and Cola Thanks for the food! Delicious! Primitive man also likes hamburgers Is that so? I understand now! Japanese' ancestors came from China Really? It's true Not only that, it seems that they migrated from Korea, Siberia and other Southern Islands The human race were originated from faraway Africa and expanded to all around the world over the time of thousand of years There are many types of nationalities, but if you go back to the roots of your ancestors, everyone in this world is related Then, Kukuru might be my great, great, great, great grandfather! Stop it, what about being a grandfather? A good and lively grandfather Are you okay? I haven't seen a single big tree since just now There are only rough rocks? This area was the bottom of the ocean just previously After this area, lies mainland China It's nearing sunset. We should be reaching our destination soon That's where I caught my fish! Let's descend! - It's all burnt... - It's terrible... Don't cry, Kukuru We will definitely find them Anyhow, we have reached the starting line At daybreak, we will start to go after the Kurayami tribe Here, that's it for today It's ticklish Bye, good night Yes, it's a different place so you can't sleep, right? Okay! Let's sleep together tonight Good night Missing Person Stick! This stick will point us to the direction of the missing person Northwest! The abducted Hikari tribe should be there! - Let's get going right away! - Wait! Leave Pega and the rest here, we'll use Takecopter to travel Why? They attract too much attention. We won't be able to find Kurayami tribe if they notice us and hide away Is that so? These will be able to last for three days if there's this much Understand? Be good and stay here No! I can't bring you guys along! I will be back soon. Be good! Where did they go? It has been four days since the attack. Four days on foot shouldn't be too far There should be signs of campsites Why? Did you find anything? The Kurayami tribe's spear! They hunt for food and ate it here This is the campsite of the first day Stay close to each other and search around the area I found it! The signs of the campsite on the second day Third day. Which was yesterday? Quickly! It's nearby! Village head! Go ahead. Don't bother me - What's all this lingering about? - Stand up! Please let us rest awhile Shut up! I can't stand it anymore! Everyone! Lord Tsuchidama, do you have any instructions? Kill those who resist and those who can't walk We need to proceed. It's still a long way to Tokoyami Castle Yes! Come by all means! Fool Listen, everyone I'm the Spirit King Dorazombie. Release the Hikari tribe! Or I will set the lightning spirit upon you and barbeque you - Spirit King? - Dorazombie? Don't you understand? If that is so, I'll let you witness... Dorazombie's power! Doraemon is like a real witch doctor Suprisingly, it's working Let's go too! Yes! - What's that? - Kukuru! Retreat! - Yes, we've won! - Serves them right! - Kukuru... - Kukuru! Father! Mother! Kukuru... Are you all right? I've miss you two! You came to save us He's able to see his family again I'm becoming weak with this What's that? The sound is coming from the inside of this thing The porcelain artwork is talking! We, the Tsuchidama, are the loyal subordinates of Lord Gigazombie Gigazombie?! This fellow! Come down here! You fool! - Giant! - What was that? - It was a shock wave! - Let's counterattack with the Shock Stick! You still don't know how to fear me! Hide behind the rocks! - The rocks! - Nobita! - Help me! - Nobita! Kukuru! - Doraemon! - Do something! Not that, not this... Got it! The last blow! Hirarimat! We did it! As expected of Doraemon... Having said that, how can this earthen doll talk and move? Doraemon! Nobita! Hikari tribe would like to say 'thank you' to you! Lord Dorazombie, we don't know how to show our appreciation Call me Doraemon... Isn't it fine, just leave it at Dorazombie That's right. Can we bring Hikari tribe to Japan with us? That's great! We won't know when Kurayami tribe will attack again! Anywhere Door! I thought the Anywhere Door can't be used? I made it remember the route when we were travelling from Japan to this place Okay. Let's go to Japan! Wait! We have to bring Pega and the rest I forgot! Let's go to Heshen in Dao province, to the Hikari tribe village This is our village I suppose everyone has gone through the door? You raccoon monster... I will make you pay! Pega! Gris! Draco! We're going back to Japan! You'll be left behind! Everyone! Where did they go? It's my fault. I left them here and now they are missing Don't worry. They are strong Maybe they are happily roaming around Let's go back to Japan first! No! I will search until I find them! I understand your feelings,but we have to bring the Hikari tribe to the safe Japan as soon as possible How beautiful Is it really okay to stay here? It seems like there isn't anybody staying here, so please just choose a place where you'd like to set up your village It's great here, it's beautiful and near to the lake! What are you doing? Cutting wood for the pillars of the house Cutting with a dull axe is very troublesome Oh, yes! Lord Dorazombie, this is the first catch from this piece of land. Please eat it Thanks for the food! - Delicious - Doraemon Lend the tools to these people No! History will be distorted if the Stone Age people uses future tools Humans think creatively and create tools which are convenient through hardwork This is called the development of civilization Inflexible fellow Stingyzombie That's not the problem! Shizuka! What do we do with the cut grass? Please stack it there Stone Age kids sure are hardworking Shall we help? Uncle, aunt, I will put this here Well, thank you Everyone's so busy, but what is Nobita doing? I suppose he must be sleeping on the river bank Pega! This is a dog whistle. I made it from the bones of a deer I use it to call Ro Ro? The wolf puppy I used to rear It was very close to me and was a cute fellow There was a time, the village went on a journey. There was no more food to hunt nearby Sun set and sun rise, sun set and sun rise... It was a long journey We found a group of mammoth, we shouted and cornered them The mammoth fought, for their lives and there was a huge commotion I don't know when Ro went missing! I wonder if it squashed by the mammoth or did it sink into the mud Did you leave it? I couldn't be a spoilt brat Even so, I blew the whistle every day Then one fine day after a month... - Ro! - It was covered in mud and had wounds but it ran into my arms at full speed The animals have a strong sense of finding their owners That's why, Nobita's three pets will also do the same Okay? The village will be completed soon, can you help? Of course! I'm so tired I can't move anymore You skived off halfway There are blisters on my arms I was cut by the grass here and there Do you realize how convenient and easy you have been living through these hard labour? I haven't watched television for quite awhile I have to do homework Shall we go home for the time being? I agree! But we will be scolded by our moms Don't worry. We just use the time machine to return to where we left You're right! That's great, Stingyzombie! I'm not Stingyzombie! Here. I will be back soon, but if Pega and the rest return, please feed them with these You can count on me! We feel uneasy without Lord Dorazombie Don't worry, Gigazombie and Kurayami tribe will not come - Bye, we are leaving! - Take care! What's this? We need to gather slaves to complete the Tokoyami Castle That's why I placed you together with that monkey! I'm sorry, Lord Gigazombie Hikari tribe has found a strong ally A raccoon monster who calls itself the Spirit King, Dorazombie What? Dorazombie? Spirit King? Are you saying that his powers are above mine? It's not nonsense! Quiet! You worthless slaves! Hear this! Find Dorazombie and bring him to me! I will find you until the end of the Earth and tear you into pieces! My brain is sleepy There's a time difference, a 'jet lag' of 70,000 years What happened? You look worried Look at this - What's that? - This is the hand of Tsuchidama. I took back one of the broken pieces Ouch! What are you doing, all of a sudden? It joined back! It is made of materials I have never seen before I have sent this data to Dorami to investigate Hello? Doraemon? Are you there? According to the analysis, it is made out of shape-memory ceramic. Every particle remembers it's own structure and it has metals which have the ability to repair itself I will continue to investigate further Why is there such thing in the Stone Age? I don't know. There's only one thing for sure Gigazombie is not an ordinary witch doctor Oh no! We're too late Kukuru There's a big shadow! That's Gigazombie? You are here, Dorazombie and gang I have taken in new slaves Return Kukuru and the rest! If you want them, come to the Tokoyami Castle But be aware that you can't go back We won't fall for that threat! It's useless. That's just an image to convey a message Here is where we fought with the Tsuchidama and saved the Hikari tribe We have no idea where is Tokoyami Castle and who is this Gigazombie! Who cares! Kukuru is our friend! We can't abandon our true friend! I'm a bit scared though! Let's go then. To the deep vast lands of the mainland! When is this vast land going to end? Japan cannot compare to this vastness It is this far. How did Gigazombie find Kukuru and the others? I don't know. Instead of that, will we be able to find Tokoyami Castle? But it is really strange What is it? Isn't it strange that Gigazombie and his gang are able to make a round trip in one day even though it is so far? What? Are you feeling afraid? We will know the answer when we meet Gigazombie That's true Look, snow - I'm getting cold - Me too That's strange... The Eacon Suits are supposed to keep us warm That's possible. The temperature now is minus 50 degrees There's a limit to how much Eacon Suits can cover The Takecopter is not working well! Let's descend Again? It's useless. It overheated because of continuous usage Are there no other tools we can use to travel? There is, but it's dangerous to use it on uneven terrain Reneamotorcar Imitation! It's a good thing there's no one to look at us though To role play as a train at this age Stop mumbling. Let's go! Waaaahh!!! I'm dizzy! I can't breathe! Stop! Our speed now is at 400 km/h! Stop this! It's useless. We can't move forward! Hey! There's a cave! Thank God! Let's take cover there! We're saved I nearly fainted It's great everyone is here Nobita's missing! That buffoon! Maybe he fell off on the way here? I... I will go save him! Stop it! You will be stranded too! If we leave him outside, he will die! There's no way we will be able to find him in this snow blizzard, rather than that... Rescue Bottle! There's a meditative nutrition drink inside this bottle, it will search for those who are stranded and saves them But, how is it going to find Nobita? Is there anything with his scent? This will do! The Zero Mark Answer Sheet! Listen. Find the boy with this scent - We're counting on you! - Please do your best! - Please find him before it's too late! Doraemon! Everyone! Terrible, you guys just left me behind! I'm going to freeze to death... It's cold... Dad! It's a stove! Let me feel the heat too! Nobita You don't want to ask help from anyone, right? Wait! Mom! Just a bit! I'm fine with just the soup! You wanted to live alone, right? That was... No! No... It's useless I can't take a single step... This happened because you ran away from home, It wouldn't have happened if you gave up running away If you had been good and listened to your mom and your teacher, you would be in a warm futon right now No I just wanted to try It's a waste, at the end, you can't do anything by yourself Instead of that, it's about time you go to sleep I have to go save... Ku... Kukuru Is it? Do as you like Kukuru... Kukuru... What's that? It's suspicious... Nothing can be done even if you're feeling worried. We can only believe in the bottle and wait I can't just wait here and do nothing! Don't go too far inside, you'll get lost! That Nobita... That's why I hate fools! Suneo! There are steps going down! I'm impressed that you could reach here. I must compliment you even though you're the enemy How far will these stairs go? It's probably going to penetrate the Earth Look! There's light inside - What's that? - Let's go! Such a huge number of villagers from the Hikari tribe are slaves! As I thought, this is the Tokoyami Castle! Look! Kukuru is over there! That brute! The only thing I can't forgive is slavery! Ultra Stop Watch! - Everything looks like it's frozen. - There's no movement! It's a time lock. Besides us, everyone is frozen in time You just need to touch the person with this to let his time move again We have to hurry and save everyone! We need to save such a huge number of people at once and secure the escape route The tool I always use, Pass Loop! With these, everyone can reach the surface at once I will check whether this hole connects to the surface Hurry! We're counting on you, Doraemon! That's weird. There shouldn't be any bends You must be kidding me! What's this place?! Why is there such a place here? Why is there such machine underground in Stone Age? Impossible! Time should be frozen Welcome, little Dorazombie This room is a sacred place which is forbidden to everyone but I allowed you to come in as a sign of respect to your courage Why are you moving even though I have frozen time? I released the time lock Released? I understand now! You're from the future, right? You're a time-space criminal who intends to change history as you wish You did well in realizing the truth. But I'm far from being criminal, I am the God who controls history I came here to wipe out the rotten future Where it is controlled by ignorant primitive man The Time Patrol will not allow you to do as you wish! That's why I build this secret hideaway deep underground So that the Time Patrol will not be able to detect me Take a look! The Time-Space Destruction Machine! - With this machine, I will be able to create time-space distortion freely - time-space distortion? That's it! You're the one who dragged Kukuru and us into the time distortion! I'm sorry. It was just a test If I drop the plasma ball into the time-space distortion, the time tunnel will be destroyed into ashes. Nobody can enter into this timeline and I will be the ruler of this eternal dynasty Do you think you could be the king of the world easily? And what do you intend to do? Dorazombie I will catch you! And hand you over to the Time Patrol! Very well! Catch me if you can! I will let you be my subordinate if you admit defeat! Who wants to be your subordinate? Full power! Impossible. Tools from the 22nd century can't work Tools from the 22nd century are too primitive. I'm from the 23rd century Alas, I lost by one century Pega! Gris! Draco! You're all okay! I missed you! That's right! I fainted in the snow Did you guys saved me? Thank you! Thank you, guys! I wonder where are Doraemon and the others. I supposed they have found Tokoyami Castle? Gris! Did you find something? This is my answer sheet! Which means that Doraemon is nearby? Who would have thought that Doraemon would lose? I'm sorry He isn't helping during this important moment? That's why I'm apologizing! Siberian tiger? - Will we be eaten? - Do something, Doraemon! - I can't! - Mama! Stop your worthless struggles You will be living sacrifices to the dark spirits! If you want to eat, eat Giant! If you want gourmet, it's Giant! You rascal! - I'm so afraid! - Don't give up until the last minute! What? What's that? Is that... Nobita! Everyone, I've come to save you! You're late! You're okay! You still have companions? Now's the time! Save Lord Dorazombie! Defeat Gigazombie! Useless fool! When did they escape? What are you doing? Go fight! Kukuru! - How did you manage to escape? - Nobita came to save us! - In spite of him being Nobita! - He's being impertinent I'm counting on you! Pega! You insolent fool! Tsuchidama! Help! They'd stick back together after we manage to break them out! Instant Stick Gun! Everyone! Use this to shoot at the Tsuchidama! Don't worry! We did it! Saved! Gigazombie is running away! Leave it to Suneo and I! Go after Gigazombie! Got it! - Let's go, Nobita! - Yes! Stop! Admit defeat! Persistent fools! You can't run away! Don't be so sure about that! Mammoth? It's a robot! Wait! If it's going to end like this, I will initiate the Time-Space Destruction Machine That was close! Nobita! Are you okay? As I thought, it is made out of shape-memory ceramic The Stick Gun? It's too big to seal it's movements! We chased the mammoths into the mud when we were fighting with them! Mud? That is... That's it! Doraemon, use that... Donbura powder! That's a good method too! Kukuru! Pour the contents onto the mammoths Us, too! Got it! It's useless. The entrance is too narrow, we can't go through - Pega and Gris wait here, while the rest of us go - Yes! Time Tunnel? The Time-Space Destruction Machine has been initiated! It's a pity. Preparation has just been completed Stop! If you destroy time and space, this world might also vanish! That's interesting! All the more to try isn't it Time-Space Distortion? What should we do to stop it? If we can stop the energy which flows into the plasma ball It's impossible at such a tall height! How about using Takecopter? It's under repairs! Kukuru? Kukuru! You monkey! What are you trying to do? He's trying to break the pole! How dare you ruin the sacred machine! Who's that? Is this a reverse victory homerun for us? This is two outs in baseball - Giant! - Suneo! Let's go there too! Kukuru! No! The plasma energy has stopped! You... Don't move! We are not afraid of the difference in one century as long as everyone's together! A babysitting robot being impertinent. I will break you into pieces! Bring it if you can! What?! Impossible... It should break regardless of any machine It's not a machine! This spear is a real rock spear used by Kukuru! Fake history can never win over the real history Time Patrol? Stop! Hooray! We're saved! I have been looking everywhere for you, Doraemon! - Dorami? - Dorami! Stop! Stop right there! Darn it, it was so close... Gigazombie, you are under arrest for trying to destroy history! Dorami! How did you get here? After that, i found out that the Tsuchidama was made in the 23rd century From there, I guessed that it might be a time-space crime - Dorami is so brilliant! - Different from her brother What did you say?! All of you succeeded in fighting Gigazombie. We appreciate your courage! We will destroy this base so that it does not leave a mark in history Everyone hop onto the ship! Yes! There won't be anyone who will attack you. The Kurayami tribe has also returned to their own place Thank you very much. We are truly in debt with you, Lord Dorazombie We will build a magnificent village this time I supposed this is where Japan first began - So, they are our anscestors - This a moment to remember Kukuru Take it... This dog whistle saved my life Take it, Nobita In return, don't forget me! I won't forget you! - Nobita - Yes? Are you the owner of the three animals? Yes! They are my proud pets! I'm sorry, but we have to take them to the Fantasy Safari Park Why? Fictional animals don't belong in any timeline It can't be! No! I'm their mother! I want to be with them forever! Nobita. I understand your feelings but we must think what's the best for Pega and the rest Nobita... Nobita... Nobita... Dra... Draco... likes to eat. So please make sure that he doesn't overeat Gris... likes to play with the branch And... Pega... Please brush Pega every night! Understood. I will inform the park I will make sure that the message is safely delivered! - Take care! - We're counting on you Dorami! - Bye! - Don't forget us! Pega! Gris! Draco! Be good to the kids from the future, okay? I will go see you! I will... I will also do my best! Okay. I'm leaving Send my regards to the head of department Yes. I'm leaving! Nobita, wake up Just another 10 minutes Nobita... Is he done with running away from home? Maybe Welcome back, Nobita
