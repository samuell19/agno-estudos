A CLAUDE CHABROL FILM THE TWIST BASED ON THE LUCIE FAURE NOVEL "LE MALHEUR FOU" - ÉDITIONS JULLIARD Ah! I sat on one of your boats. Ships. They aren't boats, they're ships. And you got torpedoed right out at sea. I want a couple fingers of whiskey. At your command! It wasn't my fault. Do you know your brother asked me to bang out a book about NATO? André had the plans for the next diplomatic maneuvers on a napkin that was attached to his wrist. Since when is André a diplomat? Do you remember Lully Schultz? The German broker from Salzburg. Can I have that whiskey? "May I have a whiskey, if you please?" Whether it please you or not, bring it here. Didn't Lully marry that Von Krit woman? The countess, the woman who got her first period at age 40. Lully is in passports now. 20,000 dollars and you can pick your country. Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua... Poor Nathalie, no wonder she hates her father. I hope André is an ambassador somewhere romantic, like Saint-Marin. -With ice, William. -Yes, Claire. Thank you, Ma'am. Lazy Willy, still thin and handsome. You're smaller without your stiletto heels on. You're very clever, Nathalie. Is my old auntie ready? I'm not your old auntie! You're taller than Claire. Can you kiss her when you're... I can't even see her face. Seriously, Willy. Small men also have that problem with normal women. Normal men have the same with small women. They can just lean down, then. Is Claire ready? She's in her bath. She's playing with the crew from one of my ships. What, you put ice in? You asked me for some. Well, it's too late, now. That bitch Rangeri, the old actress. She won't vote for me. I'm too manly. Why you getting worked up? I'm not worked up. I want the prize. I'll be the first American writer in France to get the Zola prize. What do you say to that? Zola, Zola, Zola! Give me a valium, please. Don't panic, sweetie. That's just what you said in New York. some years ago, when I hit on you. Do you remember? Yes, I do. A French princess, thousands of kilometers from her manor of origin. Meeting the man of her life at Wolfie's Delicatessen. And Willy stole her heart with the help of a pastrami sandwich. That's it, that's destiny. The only trouble is my books sell too well. No... And so they probably figure... They do! Yes, probably they figure that in all honesty I must make shit for the masses. Yes, that's exactly what they think. How can we help him, auntie? You can stop calling me "auntie." There. Jacques, my publisher and friend. Your passport to fortune. And visa to ruin. Go on, go and get fed, Nathalie. Look at all these wonderful friends. Sickening! Hey, France. They're all here in your honor, Billy. And, believe you me, it cost me a pretty penny. Pay yourself back with my royalties. What about the jury, any news? None, just forecasting. The glory is going to force Billy to adopt orphans if he wants to avoid too much tax. This message is brought to you by the Ministry of Public Health. The answer is no. I'd rather deal with the taxes than the kids. You're absolutely horrible. -What, me, horrible? Why? -That's right, horrible. Excuse me. How's it going, sweetie? My mother. You should dress him better, he looks like a rube. I'm uncomfortable seen with him. Don't say that. I am so constituted that I'd rather lock myself in an asylum or have some shameful disease than abandon one morsel of the object of my love for the pleasure of others. Not for the pleasure, for the use of others... I believe I recall I am his wife. But don't forget everything I do for you and that... That American. Please. We could... Under here. What, the piano? No, you're letting yourself go, compromising me! You've always been terrified of playing the piano. Charlie, do you know... Do you know each other? Claire de La Tour Piquet, Mrs. William Brandels, Miss Charlie Minerva. Charlie Minerva! Thank you. Charlie translates Billy's works into Italian. She was willing to keep me company ...to keep me company in obscurity. How charming! Claire, did you see? ZOLA PRIZE How stimulating! Stimulating, really? We've had 50,000 of these made. I'm superstitious, hide it. -Under the piano? -No, under the lion. William? A little Champagne, Charlie? And a very fresh cup for Claire. Do the two of you know each other? We're like the Brontë sisters. Oh, yeah? Close, huh? Truth be told, we haven't been friends for all that long. Jacques just introduced us. I thought Jacques was always just staring deep into the jury's eyes? Jacques's pretty little blue eyes. -You know what? -What? He's already had the Special Bastard edition printed. That, you see, I think is a rotten trick not to be pulled on a man as superstitious as me. You truly are delicious. -Excuse me. -No. God ahead, mom-in-law. Do a tango with your pineapple. I read The Bastard. I thought it was very good, how about you? Not bad. But why does he want the Zola prize so bad? My dear, the Zola prize is a wonderful consecration. For a poet, it's the modern Parnassus. You need a prize for being prosaic. You know Charlie is a wonderful adapter. Her Italian Bastard is better than the original. You couldn't even order a steak in Italian. That's why he likes it. Have another drink, go on. Or better yet, have two or three drinks. That is a positive way of accepting a negative reaction. Billy, calm down. The jury is still deliberating. Where are you going? Where are they going? -We lost. -We lost? 9 votes for Billy and 13 for Beauregard. -My God! -The prize will stay French. Come on, get over it, it's nothing. You've been able to live up until now -without medals or trophies. -Poor William. Say, now, do you know what that old whale said to me? She said, "William is one of the great talents of our era." "And he has a blah, blah, blah" Lovely weather. So, listen, wait, I said to her... I didn't say anything. But I could've said. How old is she? 100? No, she's far from being 100, very far. She is not. Yes she is, she's 96, tops. She's not. Maybe 99? But definitely not a 100. She's 100. She's not 100. I'll tell you where there's been a mistake. The mistake was... Is you. You granted a few too many press conferences. A few too many interviews, a bit too much publicity. You talked too much about the Bastard. They came to hate The Bastard, the bastards. The decline of a country. The decline of a people. Say, Clair. Why don't you go wipe down the desk? The desk is disgusting. All I can do is sew up your socks. What? You sewed up my socks? You sew up my socks? Not even! It's my fault you didn't get the Zola prize. I don't give a damn about Zola. The only thing that scares me is wandering through fields screaming at the top of my lungs: "A woman's fortune is between her legs. "A woman's fortune is between her legs!" Balzac said that wasn't true! I just went by, I had a look, touched, felt up, and found nothing interesting. And a child. I didn't even give you a child. Claire, storks bring children, not women. I never asked you to make me one. Is there something, something I can do? Yes, I have an idea. Put that alarm back, fuck off to your room and get back to whatever you were doing. I'm old. You aren't old. Don't be charitable. Jacques. Jacques. He's a perfect man, he's always just so nice. Hey, little old lady, if you're taking root, turn on your hazard lights! -Are you cold? -Oh, no. Delicious! Can you give it to me now? You're unpredictable, honey. Usually, you want a cigarette after champagne. Why don't you try it in your champagne? Delicious! What a strong stomach! What did you do before you came and joined me? I spent the day working. And then I had a quick bite at an old Chinese place. Returned to the office and slipped away just in time for our date. Ma'am? I'd like a small piece of info. By all means. Do you keep the names of all your customers? We try to, Ma'am. We send them a splendid catalog in spring and fall. Splendid! Tell me, I think you know this very dear friend of mine, Mr. Jacques Lalouette. Didn't he recently buy a little... A small little... I'm afraid that kind of question isn't... But I'm Mrs. William Brandels. The Bastard. Yes, but regardless of the circumstances, discretion is one of the golden rules at our establishment. In the same way that a priest makes it his duty not to reveal the confessions of a sinner. For us, buying a jewel is an act that is just as secret as the absolution to which it is similar in many ways. And I would even say it is even more important if you take into account that, very often, mammoth sums are at stake. Yes, I see what you mean. I'd like some cufflinks. Gold one. Gold ones, of course. You want a light? No, not like that. Put the cigarette higher, where the lighter is. If you want to smoke, you have to know the ritual. Thanks. Now listen to this. "Caroline, at age 18, "knew the art of living without precautions or preparations, "she used her conscience only based on her desires, "her aspirations, her thoughts, and her actions. "She'd already experienced individuality. "Suffocation leads to ashes." You think there is any point in me writing, now? I'll tell you something, pal. Everything you see here is pure shit. And I believe that. It's shit. I'd like to be able to count on you to tell me when I'm making shit. I got a telegram from Dad. He's in Cucarachas. Not Cucarachas. Caracas, Caracas. Let's see. Is he there long? Five to ten years. -So, I'm head of the family. -No, sweetie. That makes you the only one in the family who's never been arrested. And that's all. I'm off to build a new nest. Claire isn't here, I need a grandma's opinion. I'll tell her to go see you when she comes back. It will only be me, alone. I'll be the sole animate object. A surprise for you, honey. I bought some things. Another little present? Nathalie wants to talk. Your brother's been arrested. Again? You know, I bet it's splendid. Cufflinks? You know you gave me some three days ago? Yes, but you can never have enough. Yes, but honey, all my shirts have normal buttons. That's right. And it gets on my nerves. I'm off to see Nathalie. It's Claire. André's in the can. William told me. Now that I'm nearly an orphan, I need someone who loves me. You know men well, don't you, after all this time. Inside and out. Spit it out. His name is Robert. I hope he's a bit more presentable than the one you picked up in New York. That swarthy Puerto Rican. Yes, he's got a lovely, smooth shade. A lovely black shade? White, for a change, and he's a doctor. Marry him. I don't think I can go the distance. What do you know? All couples aren't like you and William. That's no reason. I can't figure things out clearly. You've always had a few problems with your head. You know, the problem is that, as soon as he takes me in his arms, I get all excited. He's a fantastic lover. But he's a bit of a dumbass. But he's a doctor! He's a doctor for dogs. Claire? Are you jealous of me? Jealous? I'd like you to tell me why. Don't you fear that... if I found myself alone with William, I might provoke him? Even you won't get anywhere with William. He's not much interested in sex anymore. That's what he tells you. He's withdrawn into his shell, sweetie. All I want is for him to be happy. Please. I'm warning you, I don't have any money. A small film, that's all I produce. Small films. With expensive stars and fabulous budgets. If only it were that easy... Put yourself in my shoes. I'm just asking you for a sufficient offer for the rights to William's book! Claire? Excuse me. By all means. Thank you. I'm starting to get a cramp. Help me. Do you have a pen? Thanks. Don't make the William too big and don't forget the M. I wouldn't leave a checkbook hanging around if I were you, Mr. Brandels. What's going on with your eye? It keeps blinking. Look who's come to say hello to us, Claire. Jacques, you aren't going to introduce us every day! Can you sign here? Would you be so kind as to sign too, Ma'am? Mrs. Dupont, D, U, P, O, N, T. -Hello, Ma'am. -What? How are you? Don't stay too long. Disgusting! MALIBU INTERNATIONAL PRIVATE DETECTIVE Please, come in. Hello, Ma'am. Get the door, it's cold. Thank you. Dupont. Mrs. Dupont? Is that right? Is the gentleman you were talking about a relation of yours? No. Your husband then, I suppose? Oh, Lord! Not at all! No, no. To tell you the real truth, I came instead of someone who didn't come herself, there you go. I understand, Ma'am. Regardless of your investigation's revelations, they are of no importance to me. Things will be less unpleasant for you, Ma'am, because we dig very deep. We press to the nub of the truth. Don't tighten too much. So, we're dealing with daddy rabbit, is that it? Mommy rabbit. The smell of females is more persistent. You're quite right. Very well. If we need to follow this Charlie Minerva, we have a choice between the 6 a.m., 12 p.m., and 6 p.m. services. Night and day. Don't call me. Wait for my call. I don't want a check, Ma'am. My bank account is still in California, and to make things simpler, you'll give me 1,000 dollars in cash and the rest day by day. You're late. I got lost in that jungle. Why did you choose this horrible park to meet me in? I was... I had a friend to see in the area. Wonderful alibi. Mrs. D, the news is good. I've put my best sleuth on the case. We have a precise modus operandi to tell you about... And for a mere 1,000 dollars more, you will get the man's name, his job, and his habits. No. I only care about the woman. Well, here is the report, D. First, she studied Art Deco. Second, she has a six-year-old female child who was born in Italy. Third, she is able to count only on herself to raise her child. No sign of alimony. Four, she is having an affair with an individual who seems to be married. Very well, give it to me, I'll read it. Certainly. Here. I suppose this man lives with her? I'm afraid not, Ma'am. They see each other every day, almost, but only for a quick... Well, for an hour or two, either in the evening or the morning. Honestly, whether it's in the evening or the morning... They can do as they please in evening or morning. I don't care, I don't give a damn. There they are. This is intolerable. Huh? Let's just say it's burnt to a crisp. Will you look at this soup. This bouillabaisse is as horrible to look at as everything that woman tries to cook. I see a fish with white spots on its head. Gretel. I know, those are sick fish eyes melting into the sauce. -I'm going to hurl. -You're nauseating. Gretel! Don't be scared. Oh, Ma'am... What's that? It was the pressure cooker, Ma'am. Why it's like a bomb. -It did seem like one. -Was it? Keep your cool. Was it the pressure cooker or a bomb? There is a slight difference, after all. Either way, it's the same result. The kitchen is in flames. Please, go put it out. And try to save a few slices of your roast duck. -Go on, go! -Yes, Ma'am. What do you want her to do, rub it on the wall? Right, it's settled then, I'm going out to eat. No, I refuse, I haven't... Goodbye, whoever you are. Did I wake you? No matter, I love using the phone. You have such a manly voice, honey! Are you coming by today? Yes, I'll come by, of course. I love you, sweetie. "Charlie Minerva, Victor Basch street, Charenton." He's a bastard. Hello? For the lady? A little sparkling white. White wine. Muscadet? Sauvignon? Muscadet. Sauvignon. Can I make a phone call, please? Mr. Jacques Lalouette, please. He's a bastard. Jacques? You did well to call. Can... Can't we see each other later? Give me two or three hours. I'm overwhelmed with work. That much? Better late than never. The key is under the rug. Goodbye. Another Sauvignon, please. William, why... Why, what are... Why, you aren't allowed to do that! That's not your child. Gretel. Is the lady in? I'm here. Give me five minutes to dress, I didn't know we were going out. We're staying here, where it's safe. In the kitchen? In the living room? In the bedroom? Safe from what? Come here. What's with the sudden vamp? Claire, have you been drinking? Your breath! Breathe very deeply, it will do you good. And Nathalie? She's in bed with Sartre. And Gretel? You know Gretel, she's capable of doing anything... Sukiyaki? Her samurai whisked her away. No, honey, I told you I didn't want... No. I don't want to. Someone's calling me, I have to pick up. Claire, it's an SOS! Please! Hello? Yes. No, it's a real pleasure to hear you. On the contrary, I love it. I'd have to do a little bit of research work. No, that's great. Who? Yes, wonderful. That's fantastic. Really, she's done a good job. Yes, there are many facts, most of them unclear. Yes. No, I know there is too much romanticism, that's true. No, no, Jacques, I don't know at all about... No, improvements are out of the question, I won't water down a single page. Yes, one minute, Claire's here. Hang on a sec. Yeah, you're telling me! It's for you, he wants to say something. I don't want to talk to him. But he wants to whisper something in your ear. It must be quite serious. No, no, I'm not here. Jacques, I don't know, I can't figure out where she's gone... Yes, she might be in Nathalie's room. But, I... I have no idea. Yes, I'll try, that's possible, yes. Oh, Claire! Claire! This is really embarrassing, do you realize? Hello, Jacques, I don't know where she is, Jacques. Well, the truth is, no, seriously, she comes and goes and now, she's not here. Yes, yes, I have no idea, she seems to have disappeared. Disappeared where? You said she was with you before. He wants to know how long you'll be gone. I don't know when she'll be back, she didn't say. Come on, now, don't insist on it. I'm not a clock. Yes, got it. I'll do that, Jacques, I'll tell her all that when she comes back. Oh my God, damn it! Yes, you can count on it. Yes, bye-bye. -He'll call you back. -No, I don't want to talk to him. Come on, I want to be alone with you. I'm allowed to be alone with my husband, my little husband. I want to feel you deep inside me. Claire? What's gotten into you? No, don't say anything. It's not my fault, I love you. Did I wake you? Are you alright? No. William, don't you want us to leave Paris? No, at the moment, no. I need vitamins. What I need is oxygen, other faces. I want a different body, you hear? A different body? No, you just need a stay in a spa for a few days. Come on, let's leave Paris. Leave Paris? Are you kidding? Why leave Paris? So many Americans would give their right arm to live in Paris. You want to leave Paris, just as it's getting chic to live here? What if I got really sick, William? Please, I beg you. Not today, please. Claire, Claire, I've already got enough to do as it is. My God... No matter. I won't ever ask you for anything again, there. Have a good day. Mom, Dad. Are you the one making all that racket, Claire? Sounds like a machine gun. It is a machine gun. A mountain of correspondences to handle. And William's notes. Completely illegible! You have to type them up well, look. Is this book good? I don't know, I just type. Willy makes the same mistakes as a cowboy. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yup. Robert and I had a fabulous night. Spare me the details, please. That's not what I was talking about. Really, Claire, you're obsessed. I'm going to marry Robert. We've decided to give an uncommon experience a try. A three-month honeymoon in a circus. Yes, I see, he's the clown who will shoot you out of the canon. No, he will work as the itinerant vet. And where will you go after that? To a zoo? Be serious, Claire. I am. We made plans all night. There is no point in getting married, Nath. What's the difference? You know, I don't care. It's Robert. The ceremony is important to him. I'm going to get some air. Buy me a wedding gift. A chicken. Cherries! They've come straight from the Cape, Ma'am. A kilo. Alright, my little lady. Claire? Claire? Claire? Cherries? In the middle of the afternoon? What's going on? I never see you anymore. You're never there when I call. And you never call me. So, tell your old Jacques. There is a kind of providence to a leaf falling. If they say it will fall tomorrow, then it will do so. You've got to get used to it. What matters is being ready. Look, if I did something you don't like, we can go have a drink somewhere and talk about it. Or at my place, if you prefer? Alright? Come on. Don't touch me. Listen, let go of me. -What, Claire? -Who are you? Who? -Murderer! -Claire! -Stop it! Leave me alone! -Claire! Is this man bothering you, Ma'am? She's not right in the head. Show me your papers, you. Your papers! Good evening. What's wrong? My stomach hurts. Well, not from typing up the pages I produced. No, but I went to town on some cherries. You going for a walk? I'll come, can I come? You know I think when I walk. Don't forget the center of my feet, the soles of my feet, fertilize my grey matter. But we used to go on long walks. I know. Don't you remember the day he held up the restaurant at gunpoint? He shot some Swiss cheese, he found there weren't enough holes in it? That's it! Push, push! That's what I'm doing! Quit humiliating me. You ready? How's it going tonight, old pal? That's good. Hurry up! The curtains open at 8:30. Now that Nathalie is leaving, -the place will feel much bigger. -Look, is this ok? Hey! -Fantastic. -Thanks. -Where's Nathalie going? -She's marrying her vet. You kidding, is she pregnant? No, Robert would've got rid of it. Least he could do. Right, of course. A quick uppercut right in the oven. It's pretty ugly, but very effective. They have vacuums now. You mustn't tell Robert there are machines. That guy panics in the face of progress. Hurry, you still aren't ready. But I am ready. You haven't even put your ring on. You fucking kidding me? Well then know Phaedra and all her fury. My Gods are my witnesses. Those gods who, in my side, have lit the fatal fire to all my blood. Those Gods who have made a cruel glory of seducing the heart of a weak mortal woman. You, then, in your mind, summon the past. It wasn't enough to run from you, cruel thing. I chased you away, I wanted to seem horrible to you, inhuman. All the better to resist you with, I tried to arouse your hatred. What good were my useless pains? You hated me all the more, and I didn't love you any less. My sorrows made you charming in new ways still. I yearned, I dried up, in the fires, in the tears. Weak plan of a heart that is too full of what it loves. Alas, I stopped talking to you about anything but yourself. In the absence of your arm, lend me your sword. Give it to me! What are you doing, Madam! Sweet Gods! But someone's coming: avoid horrible testimonies. Come here, come back in, and flee certain shame. I was hoping for a reception with a bit more ceremony. And more intimate, too, no? The President of the Republic, or maybe the Count of Monte Cristo. And the three musketeers, if they aren't busy. Don't forget the marquess. The cake, the pastries, and the quiche Lorraine are so refined! It's a level of classy even Duchamp didn't reach back when he was really king. Mom, go tell Nathalie how much fun you're having at her reception. But, but honey... Honey, what on earth is this? What is...? What on earth is...? Claire, we're out of here, for better or for worse. I'll miss you. Goodbye, Claire. We'll call you. You coming? Write me. Alright! William? William? Where on earth were you? These notes are impossible. I can't focus. I can't write faster than a machine gun bullet. What I can do, is jump off the roof of the house, there. You always get discouraged in the middle of a novel. I'm far from the middle, I've barely made it to page 21. Well, you can't even reread yourself. Look at this, it's like you had someone else write it. That's exactly right. I hired someone to do my research for me. He can't be more than seven. Charlie Minerva. The little Brontë sister. You're helping her adapt Jane Eyre. Be sure to tell her how much I admire her acrobatic style. I'll tell you what I'll tell her. I'll tell her she's often hard to read, that's all. Tell her I'm the one who finds her hard to read. Look me in the eyes, William. Have I lied to you, even once? No, Claire. Well, then, the day I said the apartment seemed a bit big for the two of us, should I have simply packed my bags -and scrammed? -No. You should've listened to your wife, thanked her for thinking of moving to the country. -Out in nature. -No. We've had this discussion before, lady. The country is a no-no. Your health and mine are at stake, William. This has nothing to do with my health. -We must leave Paris. -Stop this nonsense. -Before it's too late. -Why? Leaving Paris is out of the question, just forget it. I'm staying because it's a city I like. I like writing here, it suits me. I like writing here and Fernand likes smoking his cigarette. Nathalie may be gone and it's a bit big. You wrote 21 pages in a month! -That's different! -Your secretary's illiterate. Well, my dear lady, I'm just suffering from temporary writer's block. Do you think a novel writer constantly has brilliant ideas going through his head? Some win prizes, William. Bravo, Claire. Does that mean I am incompetent, a loser? Does it mean I can't write? It means you'll do better in the open air. There are pleasant spots. I'll be happier in the streets, for sure! I'm going to... I hope you get run over! -Smooshed! -Leave me be, leave me the hell alone. And don't come back. Gretel! Gretel! Shit. Of course. I'll get dressed and we'll go to Maxim's. You not sleeping? Claire? Claire? What's going on with you? You should've swallowed a bit more if you wanted to do yourself in. Between us, you're a... You're really dumb, Claire. With all your superiority, your supposed class. No, no, no. Are you having fun? Too bad you didn't experience this earlier. See what you missed out on? There you go, it's over. Here, a kleenex. Oh God almighty. You want to drink a bit of water? Yes. No, no. It's nothing. You'll never forgive me for what I did. It's going to be OK, honey, it's over. I did something terrible. It'll be OK. -There. -You'll never forgive me. I will, I forgive you in advance. If you knew what I'd done. Come on, I told you it's over, sweetie. I signed something in your stead. So what? That's no big a deal. You always sign in my stead. No, you don't understand. I imitated your signature. I sold the apartment. You what? What? I sold the apartment. I imitated your signature. I was sick of living in this house. Don't fall asleep, no, don't fall asleep. Anything but that. I also signed... Wake up. No, don't fall asleep. I also signed, William. Yes, you said that. -What else? -Sold the apartment. Yes, I know you signed in my name. Imitated my signature. You said that. You're repeating yourself. But you said you did something else. What else? Tell me, what else did you do? I'm sick. I know you're sick, but don't fall asleep. What else? I want you to tell me what else. I told the apartment. I bought a chateau. Shit. This is for the dining room. Second floor. Look at this, this shack is a real ruin. Second floor. On the left. -Ma'am, Ma'am? -Yes. When is the rest of the staff coming to put this all away? Second floor. There. You sold my apartment to buy a ruin like this? Wait till you see the dining room. Come on. Ma'am, who is going to clean all this? You'll take care of everything, Gretel. There, on the left. No, not there, right there. Go on, go on up. Come see. It must be here. The kitchen. Gretel, here is your kingdom. This way, this way. Come here. It will be wonderful to wake up every morning out in nature. Ma'am? Do I get a compass so I can get around? Look at this view, Gretel. Look at that romantic river. All you had to do was imitate a signature, shit. Look at that gorgeous sky. These windows are gorgeous. Yes. Look at these birds. I've saved the biggest room to be your office. Come on. Listen, listen to that silence. That way. It's gorgeous, Ma'am. Look. You'll have a rejuvenating experience here. Look at the view. We'll mostly be seeing Gretel's agony when she has to clean 20 rooms. I'll help her. You'll be dead tired after an hour. Look. You'll have crevasses in your shoes. I want you to work in peace. Come on, come. You can start tomorrow if you want. Where's it get screwy? Screwy? You should see Dr. Lartigue. He has a reputation, as they say, for being razor-sharp. Women call him the hurting machine. Bam, bam, bam, a real machine gun. It goes very fast. He has a red car. And he knows all about what women want. Kamasutra, maso. Up to and including acrobatics. He has an enormous... Nose? Yes, but, watch out. You can count the number of bastards he's had on a centipede's fingers. How did you do that? Oh, it was an accident. I'd better see Dr. Lartigue. Or it might get infected. Oh, no, Gretel. You didn't fall out the window. I just put a clean band-aid on that dear Gretel. Clean? The opposite of old, dirty, disgusting. What happened? Just a cut. But she's bent on seeing Dr. Lartigue. It might be infected. She has other reasons to go to the doctor. No, mostly what she was hoping for was some kind of physical effect. Gretel. Gretel! Dr. Lartigue? Help! Help! Shit. Help! Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am! You don't need a maid, you need an exorcist! Have you gone mad, Gretel? No, but I'm going crazy. I'm so scared my teeth are chattering. I'm cold down to my toes. I'm nearly ready for the... For the insane asylum. Come on, now, Gretel... Gretel, we'll find someone to help you. You'll split the work. But let's be fair, William, the work isn't all that. There 829 windows to wash. There isn't a single pot in the room. Anyway, I hate this house! We're leaving! Why do you want to get the hell out just as things are settling, just as things are starting to work out? No, no, no! Nothing works normally here, not even you. Don't panic. I'm not panicking. I'm going! And this time, I'm not coming back. Never, never, never. For real! Where is she going? Can I come in, sweetie? Said the spider to the fly. That's a very nice robe, William. You haven't come out of it in four days. I have no one to impress. Louis XV called. He won't be able to come to lunch, so... But Dr. Lartigue might come. I ran into him this morning in the village. He's a strong man, with a long, handsome nose... And everything in the pants. No pants. -How are the last pages going? -Just fine, Claire. Yeah? I'll get lunch ready. But please, shave a little, will you? We'll eat in the kitchen, no one will see you. Don't forget to let me know when... When you have something to type up. Not yet. I've got the general idea. There are some motivations I need to delve deeper into. You started a month ago. You need to understand something. The start and end are quite clear. It's the middle, from page 20 to page 500, where things aren't going quite right. Take your time, William. Take your time, William. Shit. William? William? The toilet's clogged. So I was trying to find somewhere a bit isolated behind the house. Out on the road? No, listen, I need to go to town and buy razorblades, that's all. Do you need anything? No, nothing. Wait, yes, deodorant. Charlie, I can feel the gentle burn of your flaming lips binding me to you like a magnet, giving birth to a thousand desires, a thousand forbidden visions in me. Bastard. Why you setting the table here? Tonight is special. Oh, yeah? I had no idea. You having a whole busload of tourists over? I hope they're nice and fat. Go listen to your record. I can hear it quite well from here. I'll help you a bit. What if you filled the saltshaker? Where is the salt? In the kitchen. In a paper bag. I just bought some. While you were at the post office. I didn't see you. Why didn't you tell me you had to go to the post office? Touché, Claire. Granted, I should've admitted to it, it's true, after all. If a person is interested in you enough to count your daily bowel movements, they have reason to be kept abreast of your post office trips. Who did you write to? I wrote to Jacques because I think it's normal to tell him about the novel's progress. No one else? I wrote to Charlie, I had questions to ask her. You can't live without her, is that it? I find it quite difficult to do research about the children of the Pleiade or aboriginals from the islands of Oceania who are descended from Tangelo when we live out in the woods. I know you can't stand the idea of living away from everything. Claire, listen. Do me a favor. No, no, listen to me, do me a favor. I'm willing for you to lock me up here, but don't tell me how to work. You and your work... You write letters all day. You're obsessed with messages. Look, you're the one who has too much work, not me. I wish I could say it was you. But you're clearly tired. Have me locked up for fraud. You'll finally be rid of me. In all honesty, I do think that... I thought about that. I should've done it. No, but you're bored with me. I swear, if there is one man on earth who isn't bored, it's most certainly me. Don't cry. Please. Come on, do me a favor. Let's go eat. Let's eat before... ...yesterday's lunch gets cold, OK? When I was a kid, I was very scared of storms. I'd get more and more paralyzed when seeing big black clouds. Now, whenever I see the clouds break, it has the opposite effect on me. I feel calm and relaxed. I would so like for you not to be unhappy. I'm not unhappy, you know. I'd even say that, at the moment, I'm not unhappy at all. Maybe I made a mistake when I tried to cut bridges. You had to do it, that's all. If you want to go to Paris, go ahead. Just for a few days. It's going to rain. Go to Paris, William. I'll be back in a few days. A barrel of beer for my men and water for my horse, Pierre. Hello, Mr. Brandels. Which flea-infested room did you put me in? -Room 309, with the terrace. -Very well. Mr. Lalouette is waiting in his office. Great. Take care with this suitcase. 309. Are you reading my biography, sweetheart? I work in reception, now. Sir Lancelot, how's Gwenevere? All alone in her tower. Congratulations, you've climbed up the social ladder a bit. Beauty and competence don't come together all the time. Got nothing for me? No. Each time I get to work in that chateau, I see a black knight arriving coming to provoke me. Buy yourself a few serfs. No, old peasants are less expensive and just as efficient. I have to run. Hang on. You asked me to come by. Remember? Yes, you'll come with me tonight. Private premiere at the Crazy Horse. You don't think Lancelot would go have fun without his Gwenevere? No, but I'm your friend and chaperone. I just had Bernardin on the phone. There will be loads of photographers. At what time? The first show. You have about... My watch has stopped again. It may be published, but it can't even be sold in a train station. Is anyone home? It's the postman. Is anyone home? "Need to see you. Coming tomorrow. Tenderly, Nathalie." Hello. Hello, Catherine. Mind if I come in? Mom, it's William. You don't write too often. I got your first letter yesterday. Want a drink? Can I have orange juice? Yes, help yourself, sweetie. Please, sit down. I knock out way more work when the author isn't there, leaning over my shoulder. Know what I mean? You need a holiday, huh? To stay in bed all morning. Have breakfast in bed. How is your wife doing? Is she happy, down there? No. No, she's not. Neither am I, in fact. We're there, the two of us, living unhappily under the same roof. And that's why you and I are flying off to New York tomorrow. I made myself write legibly. There. You don't seem to have grasped what I just said. Mom, it's time. She's going to the neighbor, Mrs. Dumont's. But... If you're going out, where will you sleep? I won't be here, I'm going out, too. Oh, I thought we... Go see your friend Annie. You'll have dinner with her, OK? -Yes, Mom. -There. -Have a good night, Mom. -Goodnight. Goodnight. Say goodnight to William. -Try to behave. -OK. I missed you. Very much? No, not too much. Have you been all alone since I left? Now, there's a question. It's a normal question, isn't it? Do you want to come to New York with me? There is a plane tomorrow at 11. It's as simple as that. What do I do with Cathy? Easy, we bring her along. I think I'm going to call my wife. I'm going to tell her what her husband has decided to do. I'm going to call her. And get it over with. Hello, Dr. Lartigue speaking. Did you get a wrong number? Weren't you meant to go out? I don't like standing people up. The night at the Crazy Horse would've been a bust, anyway. You sure you aren't mad at me? No, I promise. Don't stand them up. I'll take you back to Paris, OK? You sure you want me to go with you? Yes, I have two plane tickets. We can meet up tomorrow morning. At around 10 at the airport. Will you come? Two dresses and a bikini. William? You're forgetting your notes. A whiskey. Johnnie Walker. Thank you. Shit. Nathalie. Did you get my telegram? Is the circus in town? No, he lied to me, there was no circus, it was an old farm. I don't want to live with a liar. This is delicious. Robert says wild mud is the best fertilizer. But you must know some secret for growing vegetables so fast. Oh, no, Robert must know better than me. He specializes in fertilizer. Robert knows nothing and Robert doesn't do anything. I finally saw his true face. I was the one getting up at 6 a.m. to go pump rainwater out of the wells. I was the one caring for his trees and cleaning the stables. The only effort he was willing to make was screwing all day long. Yes, fertilizing. I could throw up at the idea of seeing him again. Well, what do you want me to tell you? I'd like you to tell me I was right to leave, that a woman shouldn't be treated like an animal. You didn't tell me why Willy is in Paris. He wanted to go. I thought I'd find him here. You're still a child. I think you underestimate me a bit. One must learn to live with one's husband. Marriage is a state where you have to know how to give. It's always me who gives and it's always him who receives. I don't have the strength to give anymore. You have to make an effort to try to understand him. If I'd told you what he dared say to me. Robert doesn't love me. It's over, I'm done with him. You can't stay here. So, you're kicking me out? Where will I live then? Go back to Robert. You don't understand me. And you don't understand me. And that's that. It's very easy, my dear little lady. You bring a pan of water to a boil, and you put mustard in it. And you let that simmer for about 20 minutes. You dip your adorable little trotters into it for about 10 minutes. Oh, right, and the water has to be very, very hot. No cheating. Thank you, Dr. Lartigue. I was scared my ankle might start swelling again. No, no risk. There is no reason to worry. Thank you, thank you. And if you notice any complications, call me. Call me. You have my number. Thank you very much, Doctor. This guy's crazy! What an idiot! Are you not right in the head? My head is doing just fine. My head and all the rest, in fact. What you need is a psychiatrist, though. I.. I... I... Right, thanks. I had a customer in my cab. Show I'm not wrong to drive myself. You know what you are? We don't admit peddlers. What's hiding in the suitcase? It doesn't taste like it comes from a can. It doesn't taste like it comes from a can. No, Claire. Goodnight. We can try. Christopher Seder Subtitling: Hiventy by TransPerfect
