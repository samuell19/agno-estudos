Ew. Ew.What the hell did you do that for? I hate spiders. Like they ever did anything to you. Full house. Xavier, where are those margaritas? Yeah. Coming right up. I've lost too much already. Oh, no, no. Leave me alone. No, no. No, no. Shut up! Honey, you're going to catch a cold. You need to be careful. Don't worry, I'll be fine. I'm not worried. I just don't want you to get sick. Well, I've got to get used to cold. This is true. This is true. Who's my bestest friend? You're looking at her. What? What the hell is that? My god. Do you think there's anyone on board? No, it looks abandoned. Well, I don't see anyone in the water. Let's check it out. Hello? Hello? Is anybody on board? Hello? This is creepy. Come on. Watch yourself. Wow. God, what do you think happened? Engine fire, explosion or something. Where's the crew? Looks like they got off in time. What? Oh, Jesus. All right, get on the boat. Nothing we can do. Jesus.Oh, God. You got the name of the boat?"Log" something. All right, we're going to have to call it in when we get to shore. Jason. Huh? Jason. Jason. Look. Look. Oh, shit. We got a major front moving in. Okay, get your rain gear and life vest on and tie down the main mast. I'm going to close the hatches. Hang on tight. This is going to be interesting. Mayday, mayday. Sailboat Alexandra in trouble. I repeat, we are taking on water. Mayday. Mayday, mayday, Sailboat Alexandra approximately 600 miles south, southwest of Oahu. I repeat, mayday! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex? Oh, my God. Alex, I'm coming. Hang on, Alex. I'll be right there. Alex! Alex! Hang on, Alex! I'm coming. Alex, I'm right here. Alex! I got you. I got you. All right, hang on, it's all right. It's all right. Jason! Jason! Jason! Alex! I'm here. Alex. It's okay. You okay? Stay with me. Come on. Yes. Yes you can. Hold onto me. We made it. Look over there. Look. Cargo ship. What are you doing? Let's fire a flare and hope they see it. Six degrees, left rudder. Do you think they saw it? I don't know. We've only got one flare left. We got to get closer to make it count. Hopefully they can see it. Hurry. Hurry. They're going right past us. Attention, attention, man overboard. I repeat, man overboard. Over here! Swim to the ladder. Alex! Alex, you okay? You can do it. You can do it. Hang on. Hang on. You're almost there! Almost! Hurry! Was there anyone else with you? No. You're bleeding. Nicos.Yes, sir. Find Dr. Grbac. He's in the infirmary. Bring some blankets. Okay, sir. This way. My name is Captain Bigelow. Welcome aboard my ship. Thank you. You two are going to be all right. The infirmary is just up ahead. Watch your step. Don't let the appearance here fool you. As bad as she looks, she's still solid as a rock. So, where you headed? New Guinea. But we had to slow down because of the storm. You two are very lucky, not just that we found you. But normally we only travel with a crewmember that's trained somewhat as a medic. On this trip, we actually have a real doctor on board. The infirmary is right here. Have a seat on the table. The doctor should be here shortly. We're not used to having women on board, so the clothes might be a little big, but at least they'll be dry. Oh, thank you. We'll be fine. If there's anything else I can get you, just let me know and if we have it, I'll make sure you get it. A hot shower might be a good idea.That'd be great. Thank you. The only private shower is in my cabin, so when you're ready I'll take you.Okay. Oh, Dr. Grbac. Excuse me, will you? Sure. Well, let's have a look at you. Nothing too serious there. Mr. Monroe. Go ahead, take a shower. Really Really. Come. Open. Don't touch that. Ow. Here we are. You'll feel much better after a hot shower. You'll find everything you need inside here.Thank you. We appreciate everything you've done. My pleasure. Call me Jim. Alexandra. Alexandra. Ow, ow.Steady. All right, Mr. Monroe. Cough. Again. Good. Hmm. Ow! Next, please. Right here. Lie back. Damn. Well, you're both fine. Perfect specimens. Specimens? Medical term. I'm going to give you an antibiotic. I wouldn't want that wound to become infected. Easy, easy, easy. I brought you guys some soup.Oh, thanks. Thanks. You two must be exhausted. Once the doctor is done with you here, Simmons will show you to your bunk room. See you in the morning. Here you go. Just like home. It's all here. That's it. You can take any bunk you want. Perfect.Thank you so much. Have a good night. You're really wet. Yes, I am. Why do these things always happen to us? First I almost die of cancer, then we both almost die in a storm. Can't wait to see what's next. I think maybe it's a sign. Of what? Maybe we should settle down. Start a family. And start a family? Yeah, you know, house, kids, dog. You deserve it. How is that? Well, putting up with me mostly. My selfishness. Who's my bestest friend? You're looking at her. How you feeling? Better. You? I am sore. What's wrong? I just keep thinking about that man. That could have been us. But it wasn't. Our time obviously is not up yet. So, I was thinking about what you said last night. About starting a family.Ah. I don't want to wait much longer. How are my guests this morning? Ah. Sore. Tired. Happy to be alive. Any day above ground is a good day indeed. It's breakfast time. Anybody hungry? Absolutely. Great. Come on. If there's anything I can get you, let me know. Actually, I'd love to use the radio, call ashore just to make sure nobody's looking for us. Unfortunately, the radio was damaged by the storm. Should be back on line soon. I've got a big business meeting in Honolulu in a week. I guess I'm not going to make that one, huh? I don't think so. I'll let you know the minute the radio is operational. Okay.Hey, tell him about the boat. Boat? Oh, yeah. We stumbled upon this burnt-out boat. It was like, it had an engine fire or something. I doubt it. It was in pretty bad shape with that storm.You sure the man was dead? Oh, yeah.Yeah. I found the nameplate. It was the L-O-G something. We couldn't stick around and check out the scene 'cause the storm was coming. We had to save ourselves, so... Of course you did. Of course you did. It's a good thing you didn't panic. There are a lot of pirates operating in these waters. Just be thankful it wasn't you on that boat.We are. This kind of thing happens all too often on the high seas. We just happened to be at the right place at the right time, that's all. Well, it's not exactly the Biltmore, but the food's pretty good. Was that... Dinner. Just kidding. Please. Martinez. Yes, sir? We have some new guests.Hi. Beans and bacon. You're going to love this. This is his specialty. Chili Martinez. My specialty. The meat, the meat's great. The seasoning's just right. There you go. Oh, you'll love that. Give our friend there an extra helping of beef. He needs the protein. Oh, no, I can't eat all this. Doctor's orders. Here you go. Very special family recipe. Good for you. Please, join me at my table. You must be quite a sailor, navigating so far off shore. It's not quite such a pleasure operating a ship this large. It's a lot of work. Carrying cargo is not all that exciting. Is it a light load? 'Cause I noticed from the depth marks that you're riding kind of high in the water. Good observation. You're right. We are traveling a little light, but... Isn't it kind of expensive for a ship this size to be traveling if it's not fully loaded? Well, the company makes all those big decisions. I'm just a captain. My job's just to take her from point A to point B. Well, I mean, if you all need any help, I'd be happy to lend a hand. No. No, thanks. As you can see, I've got enough crew to take care of everything. You should be thinking about getting better. Rest. It's two weeks before we get to New Guinea. You should have your sea legs back by then. Thanks. Jason. Yes? You're bleeding. Doctor. He's bleeding. Hold that. Come with me. Do you want me to go with you? No, I'll be fine. Are you sure Just enjoy your breakfast. I'll catch up with you later. Another shot? The wound is becoming infected and... I don't want it to get worse. So, what are you saying? Am I going to live or what? Yes. But you do need to rest, all right? Hey, excuse me. Do you speak English? No English. No English, okay. See, I couldn't help but notice that the doors... doors no open. Yes, doors.Right. Doors. Doors no good. No work. They don't work. See, the thing is, what I'm asking is... Look, thanks. Hey.Hey. How you doing? Good. Doc gave me another shot. Another shot? Yeah. I'll be fine. The doctor said so? Yes, he did. Can I get you something? Some Martinez slop? Unh Just you. How about a massage? Okay. Okay. Captain? Here's the fuel inventory. Oh, you're not worried about the fuel? No. Not yet. Are you? No. But I am worried about them. They know about the Logan. Who are they going to tell, huh? The radio's broken, remember? Yeah, I remember. Cargo. Simmons. Hey. Uh-huh. Captain? Sir? It's the company. They want to know when to expect us. Tell them when I find out, they'll be the first to know. Don't stop. Hey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm just a little tired. It's probably just the antibiotics or something. Maybe it's the sun getting to you. You should go lie down.Yeah, maybe you're right. You look like you're doing better. Hi. Doc took care of me.Good. Finding your way around all right? Yes. You know what thought? I'd love to see the bridge, if I could.Absolutely. Never seen a real bridge before. I promise I won't get in the way. I'd be happy to show you. How about you, Alexandra? Oh, no, that's Jason's thing. I'll just stay right here. Okay, Simmons here will give you the dime tour. Perfect. Okay. See you later. Maybe. Let's go. I'd hate to have to abandon ship. Yeah, I know what you mean. Just one lifeboat? Well, we're a small crew. I mean, don't worry, the ship's unsinkable. It's nice to see such a happy loving couple. Yeah, he's a wonderful man. I'm lucky to have him. What about you? Significant other? Oh no. No. Not everybody's as lucky as you are. Here's the bridge. Would it be okay if I made the call to shore? Our radio is still out. We'll have it fixed really soon. Is this our current position now? Yup. Must've seen the world. I've seen a lot of ports. But to tell you the truth, I prefer the open ocean. Just me and the sea. Simple life. But it's a life. Exactly. Captain, please. Excuse me.Absolutely. Hey, chief. I need you to-- You sure about this Positive. Okay, thanks, Garibaldi. Hey! What are you doing? What are you doing? I was just checking the radio. It works. It's not working. But it is working. I heard the carrier signal. It's only static. Jesus. You okay? Yeah, I don't know. I'm dizzy. I'm not... Something's not right here. Ortiz, give me a hand over here. Let's get him to the bunk room. Have Garibaldi call the doctor. Just put him here. Come on. There we go. Jason? Excuse me. Jason, are you okay? Jason? Jason, are you all right? Jason, talk to me. Please. Excuse me, please. I told him to rest, but he didn't listen to me. What's wrong with him? Well, it could be a secondary infection. He'll be all right, but he may have to stay in bed for a few days. Nothing too serious. Nothing to worry about. Just keep him in bed, and he'll be fine. Hey, it's going to be okay. Don't let the doc get to you. He's not much for bedside manners, but he's the most qualified doctor I've ever met. Your husband's going to be just fine. Trust me. Thank you. He's in good hands. So, how's he doing? Don't worry. Everything's under control. Well, I don't like it. He's been snooping around. What if he figures out what's going on? He's almost ready. By this time tomorrow, his snooping days will be over. Alex? Alex. Jason, what's going on? Are you all right? Oh, my God. I just had a nightmare. You know, something's not right. Honey, it was just a nightmare. What the hell is that? Well, it's a scrape. I have some, too. We're lucky we don't have any broken bones. You know what? They're lying to us. I checked the radio. It's not broken. It works. Why would they lie to us? I don't know. But something's going on. I mean, the ship is in terrible shape. We're not carrying any cargo, and we're going in circles. Captain Bigelow already explained that to you. He didn't explain why we're going in circles. He didn't explain why we're not carrying any cargo. I mean, cargo ships don't travel light. It's too expensive. I think they're, like, doing something illegal, like drugs or something. Personally, I don't care. They saved our lives. I don't know, okay? I just have a bad feeling about this. Why don't you just get back to bed? We've had a really stressful day. It's going to be better tomorrow. Alex, wake up. Alex. What? What time is it? I found it. What? What are you talking about? Frozen bodies on hooks. Jason, please go back to sleep. You're hallucinating. I'll tell you what. Come with me to the freezer and if there aren't frozen bodies, I will never say another word about this ship again. Promise? Promise. Wait, wait, wait. What? Come on, let's go. Oh, my God. This is so gross. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. I swear there were bodies in here. Jason, honey, you are hallucinating. Let's just go back to bed and I'll get the doctor in the morning. No. No. See, the doctor's in on it, too, okay Hanging people from ceilings, that's what. Okay, I'm going to go back to bed and I want you to remember our deal. You don't understand. What can I do to make you understand that we cannot keep going like this? We have to get back to shore sometime soon. Don't argue with me. We'll leave only when I'm ready. And I'm not ready yet. I can't keep going on this circular course forever. Eventually we'llrun out of fuel. Don't you worry.I am worried. The company's been calling. They want to know what the hell is going on. In case you've forgotten, I'm responsible for this ship. If I have to take control You? I think you're forgetting that this is my project. I paid for this floating scrap heap. I'm paying you. Dismissed. Morning. Morning. How did you sleep last night? Well, my husband woke me up several times. How's he doing now? Is he better? I don't know. I guess we'll see when he wakes up. He's having nightmares and hallucinations. We didn't get a lot of sleep. Sorry to hear that. Well, you look like you're doing really well. Well, I guess so. Feel stronger. Good. Good. I noticed you're a photographer. Well, we have a darkroom on board. Really? Really. You're more than welcome to use it any time you want. I will definitely take you up on that.Good. Yeah. Get over there. Smile. Smile. Come on. See? You have a great smile. Bet you break hearts in every port. Find it hard to believe you never found anybody you wanted to marry. Well, I did once.Really? You told me that-- I know what I said. I... Can you tell me? No. It's a long story. Maybe later. Okay. What? Oh. It's just funny. You... You remind me a lot of her. In a good way, I hope. Yeah, in a great way. Jason. Hey.Hey. Good morning. I heard you had a rough time of it last night. Are you feeling better? No I'm not. My head feels like it's going to explode. Well, I can call Dr. Grbac. I'm sure he can give you something. I'm sure he could. I'll pass. Okay, well... lunch should be ready shortly.Thank you. That was incredibly rude. He was just trying to help. Yeah, I'll bet he is. Jim's a nice guy. Jim? You're calling him Jim now? That's nice. What were you and Jim talking about? Nothing. He was just keeping me company. Did you tell him about last night? Of course not. Jim, huh? That's great. What's he calling you now? Shmoopy? You know, your whole jealousy thing is really unattractive. I'm not jealous.Really? Jason, can we please just drop this whole thing, just chalk it up to your fever? I really don't want to fight with you right now. Just lay low until we get to land. Alex, we're not going to get to land. You see the sun? It keeps going from side to side. You know what that means? That means we're going in circles. We had a deal, remember? You promised. I'm sorry, Alex. There's something going on. Okay. Fine. You be that way. What I really don't understand, though, is that even if you're right, why can't we just pretend nothing is going on, just ignore it? Because we can't. We are in danger. They know that we know. You think they're just going to be able to let it be? The only thing that we know is that they're not vegetarians. What does that have to do with anything? That's where you're wrong, Alex. What about the cargo, the radio, the sun, the freak that keeps following us around? Why do I keep fainting all the time, huh? What's this doctor giving me? Jason, please. I'm sorry, Alex, there's something going on here, and I'm going to figure it out. How are you going to do that?I'm going to call for help because we can't do this alone. Jason. Excuse us. I was eating. What is the matter with you? I was on the bridge and the radio's now missing. It's gone. Well, it was probably being repaired. Why would it be repaired if it was already working? They're trying to prevent me from making a call. I'm going to say this one last time. You have a fever, you are hallucinating, and you need to go to bed. Don't do that, please.Don't It's the truth. Who's truth? The captain's truth? Maybe it's the doctor's truth. They've been really nice to us.Yes they have. They've been very nice. But why? Jason, let go of me. Stop it! Is there a problem here? Would you leave us alone, please? Thank you. Jason, stop it. You're hurting me. Let go of me, okay? And you leave her alone. Jason, just calm down. Or else-- Or else what? What's going to happen? I know what's going on here. I know what you people are doing. Let's go.Let go of me! He's been lying, Alex. Where are you taking him? These people are lying to you.Just wait a minute. The doctor will take care of him. Let's just finish eating. No, I'm going with him. Let go of me. What the hell are you giving him? Whatever it is, it isn't working. He's hallucinating. He's paranoid. That's why I have to give him the shots. It's just a mild silica solution. It's just a general antibiotic. You see, we have to control the fever. If we don't, he'll just keep getting crazier. But he's not getting any better, Doctor. A fever often gets worse before it gets better. Jason. Jason. I think it would be best if everyone clears the room, please. I'm not leaving him. Madam, I'm afraid your presence merely makes things worse. The sight of you feeds his paranoia. I'm his wife. Alexandra, come on, for Jason's sake, the doctor's right. He's not right. Will somebody please tell me what the hell is going on? Can I speak with you out in the hall for a minute, please? You let me know if he gets any worse.Of course. But don't worry, by this time tomorrow he'll be a new man. Alexandra, you have to calm down. Your getting upset isn't going to help Jason. Well, that is easy for you to say, isn't it? I'm sorry, I really... I really didn't mean that. You've been nothing but nice to us, and I... Why don't you let me show you that darkroom I was telling you about? It's not bad. It's nice to see you smile for a change. You have a beautiful smile. Well, I'll let you to it. Thanks, Jim. The darkroom was already here, Alex. I hope you don't mind me calling you Alex. Mm-mm. I meant thanks for listening. Comes with the job. You're welcome. Sir. We just got a transmission from the Coast Guard. Said they got an SOS call from our ship earlier today. Must have been him. That son of a bitch. Make sure they don't come looking for us. Hey, everything is under control, okay? I told them it was a false alarm. Everything is under control this time. He's getting to be more trouble than he's worth. Yup. Hold it. Thought he wasn't due for another 24 hours. Things have changed, my friend. One of my specimens has expired. I need a replacement. Besides, this fella has just been causing trouble anyway. And the girl? It's all right, Bigelow. You can keep the girl. For now. You're sick, you know that? Totally out-of-your-mind off-the-wall cuckoo bananas, fucking sick. What's the matter? It's only a spider. I hate those things. Then don't give me any shit, Bigelow. You knew what you were in for when you cashed the check. But I didn't know what you were really doing here. How many more people have to die? Sooner or later everyone dies. What I am doing will redefine genetic science and one day benefit all mankind. If a few people lose their lives along the way, it's a price that must be paid. Think of it as an investment in the future. I don't want you touching the girl. She's mine. Monroe! No smoking. How many times do I have to tell you? What part of flammable don't you understand? You know what to do. Say hello to my little friend. Spiders are carnivores. Did you know that? Once one of our specimens is no longer needed, we just give them to the spiders as an offering. Waste not, want not. There's no use struggling. There's no place you can go. Don't worry, she won't harm you. Once her egg is inside you, things will return to normal. For a while, anyway. Until the egg grows. Until her baby is dying to come out. Have no fear, the procedure is painless. Well, almost painless. But you know what they say. No pain, no gain. Just a minute, please. Oh, it's you.You've been in here for almost three hours. Really You missed dinner. Yeah, I'm starving.I figured you'd be hungry so I had Martinez save you something. You are so kind. Being captain has some privileges. Oh, did you hear anything about Jason? Oh, he's sound asleep. Doc says he should probably sleep straight through to the morning. Well, maybe I'll just pop my head in after we eat. Great. After you.Thanks. I think she's ready. Excellent. Right on time. This is your lucky day. Enjoy the show. You really had this all planned out, didn't you? Please, sit. Wine. I haven't had a drink since I was sick. It'd be a shame if you didn't at least have a sip. I won't tell a soul. You know, my friend, spiders are remarkable creatures. They are immune to all known human pathogens and ailments. Everything from the common cold to cancer. Once I isolate the gene sequence which keeps them so healthy, and splice it into human DNA, I am on the road to making mankind... disease free. Imagine what that world will be like. Once your pheromone levels are correct, you will be a perfect match for them. You'll be irresistible. A toast. To what? Life. To life. Just taking a little blood. Almost there, my friend. Almost there. For every dream, there is a nightmare. And for every disease, there is a cure. Your blood will be the basis for your personal vaccine in the off chance I want to keep you around for a little while longer. How was your dinner? Mm. It was wonderful, thank you. You're welcome. You know... you're a remarkable woman. You're intelligent, you're beautiful. Thank you. Talented. Really, I saw your photographs. You have just a great eye. Cut it out. More wine? Maybe after I go check on Jason. You know, you could live like this forever. Live like what? You. And me. And the deep blue sea. What do you think? I'm sorry. I have to go. Open the door. It's locked. Open the goddamn door! That is not... Oh, my God. It's not what you think. I have been such a fool. Stop. Please don't, Alex. No. Alex! Don't "Alex" me. Alex! Jason? Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit! Jason? Okay. Okay. Shit. That wasn't very nice, Alex. You made a big mistake, Alex. Where do you think you're going, huh? There's no way off my ship. Where is my husband? What do you want him for, huh? He can't help you. He's gone. He's not coming back. Listen, you sick bastard, if you hurt him in any way, I'll kill you, you hear me? I hear you. I'm the only one who's going to help you on this ship. Help me what? Will you help me find him? If you stay with me I'll protect you. I don't need your protection. Oh, yes you do. Or you're going to end up just like him. It's not too late, Alex. Come with me. I'll forgive you. You'll see. You'll see how... how much we belong together. What do you say? What do I say? I say fuck you, you sick fuck. Wrong answer. You give me my husband! You want to go to your husband? You got it. My pleasure. Take her to the lab. Grbac can have her. You can rot with what's left of your husband! Get your goddamn hands off me! Get the door. Bitch. Go get her. Come on. I can't believe this. Now, how the fuck did you let her go, huh? Go this way. Go. What the hell? Where the fuck is my power? Well, give me the emergency generator. Now! Fucking morons. Guard! Get in here. The spider cage. Get the door! Oh, my God. Jason. Jason. Jason? Jason, talk to me. Oh, thank God. I am so sorry. I am so sorry I didn't listen to you. Okay, let's get out of here. Come on, let's get you out of here. Come on. Let's get out of here. Grab him, you idiot! We got to go. Come on. Wait a minute. She's alive. What's wrong with her? What is wrong with her? What's happening to her? No! Save your ammunition. There's too many of them. Tell me. Tell me that is not going to happen to you. WhenI don't know. Ask our doctor friend over there. Son of a bitch. Alex. What in the hell did you do to my husband? Get out of my way, woman. How long does he have to live? If we don't get out of here, none of us has long to live. Asshole. Get it! Forget about it. Come on, come on. No more room. Sorry. Nice guy. Jason? Jason? Go on. Go on. Go. Don't you dare say that. You still got the girl? No sir. We... We kinda lost her. Get your ass up on deck now. It'll be four hours before the Coast Guard gets here. Start prepping the fucking life boat. Let's get the hell off this ship. If you had a fucking brain, you'd be dangerous. Fucking Grbac and his spiders. I knew this was going to happen. You get every man on the way and get your assup here, Simmons. Now! Simmons. Get your ass up here. Help! Help! Simmons! Ah! Fucking spiders. Okay. Let's go. Okay, they're everywhere. Come on. Yes, you can. Come on. I got to rest. Okay, sit here. This will slow them down. Let's go. There must be another way out of here. Shit. Let's go. Oh, God. Found Martinez. We're trapped. Not if I can help it. Propane. Yes. They want a fight, they're going to fucking get one. Come on, Jason, help me. Shit. How much in the tank? We're about, we're about a quarter full. Let's hope it's enough. Come on, you son of a bitch. Okay. Ready. Crank it up, Jason. Come on. Come on. Come on. You like that? How about some more? Torch the son of a bitch, Alex. Pressure's dropping. Jason, there's another one. How much do we have left? We have enough for one, maybe two. All right. That's all we got. Go! That's it. We're out. No more gas. I think we got them. Tell me we got them all. Shit! Alex. Jason. Hang on. Come on. They're everywhere. What are they doing? Looks like they're digesting their last meal. Let's go. Grbac made a vaccine. Don't worry. We'll find it. I'm going to need it soon. You piece of shit. Oh, there you are. I knew you'd make it. Get in the boat. We don't have much time. Where is it The vaccine. Where is it? It's too late for him. But it's not too late for you. He's dying. You tell me where it is. Forget about him. It's about you and me now. What the hell are you talking about? A deal. Come with me. I could use a strong woman like you. I could make your husband's last hours painless. He'll die with dignity. I'm not going to let him die. It's over. Don't you get it? Your sick experiment is over. Not yet. Look over there. I still have your husband. How long does he have? Why should I tell you? This is why. Don't fuck with me. Go ahead. Shoot! In six hours your husband will be dead. And he's all that's left of my project. So if he dies, I have no reason to live. Honey, forget about him. I know where it is. It's in the lab, isn't it? That's right, you bitch. Too bad you'll never make it. That lab is crawling with spiders. Spiders of my own creation. And they are more vicious, more cunning than anything that ever walked the face of the earth.
