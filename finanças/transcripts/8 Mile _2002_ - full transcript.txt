No. I'm at New Detroit Stamping now. Oh! That's good. What? He got fired from a pizza place. At least I got a fucking job. Okay, stop it. Only ex-cons and welfare moms work at that plant. Baby, are you staying here for a while or what? Just for a couple weeks, till I can save enough to get my own place. Just like Bob Zurowsky. All your friends still living at home, aren't they? What a bunch of fucking losers. Fuck you! What's your problem? What's your problem, bitch? Don't kick my clothes! Don't fucking judge me! Why don't you grow up! Stop it! It's him, not me! I've fought guys bigger than you. - Fucking punk. - Stop it! Hey, Lily. Hey, baby. What are you still doing up? You woke me up. Yeah, I'm sorry, baby. What'd I do? Go back to bed.

I know this girl Her name is Lily And it's past her bed T-I-M-E She goes to sleep And she can just dream And not have to be In a stinky trailer with me So when I feel blue Don't know what to do I look at you And I just say Good night, baby. Go to sleep. If you're going to live here, you have to get along with Greg. He started it. You can't fuck this up for me, baby. You just can't. Whatever. No milk. Can I get a ride to work in the morning? Where's your car? I left it for Janeane. You're going to let me borrow your car? Nope. It's your birthday present. My birthday's not for two weeks. I know. But you're still my little Rabbit, right? I need to get to sleep. Bunny! What up, doe? Heard about you and Janeane. I thought you might be back home. This ain't my home. Why you up so early? Up, man?

What happened last night? I heard you got caught out. People are saying fucked up shit. Yeah? Yeah. Why are you still going to The Shelter? There's nobody there but clowns who ain't got deals and never will. You need to stay at home. You know Wink's got you. Whatever, man. I'm telling you, I'm on my way. I'm taking you with me. You're the franchise, baby. The franchise? Yeah. I'm taking a fucking bus to work. Look, I was just on the horn with my man Roy Darucher. The promo guy? Yeah. Roy's all hooked up at 98. So what's he need you for? What's he need me for? Talent, dawg. You know that's my specialty. I'm the one that tipped him on Big O, and got that fat man out of flipping burgers at Mickey D's. Roy liked what he heard, paid for the nigga's demo, and boom, just like that, Big O got a deal, all because of me. Roy paid for Big O's demo? Every penny. If they thought Big O was hot, wait till they hear B-Rabbit. I'm building an empire and I'm taking you with me. You're next. All right. All right. I'll talk to you later. Call me later, dawg. Okay. Up! Down! Up! Down! What up, Manny? You was late today, Smith. Yeah, it wasn't my fault. My car wouldn't start... It ain't never your fault. I don't want to hear it. I guess this isn't the best timing, but I need some extra shifts. Are you shittin' me? You just started working here. Hey, Dutton. Is he shittin' me? What? You late again and you're fired. I'm looking for John Latourno. I can take you. I don't think so, Smith. Right this way. Thank you. Big wheels keep on turnin' Who the fuck is that? Greg Buehl. That dude is practically living with my fucking mom. They met at bingo. Wait. Greg Buehl? He went to our school, right? I got to save up some money and get the hell out of here. This shit is ridiculous. Well, Jimmy moved in with his mother 'Cause he ain't got no place to go Now I'm right back in the gutter With a garbage bag that's full of clothes Bust it. You live at home in a trailer What the hell you gonna do? 'Cause I live at home in a trailer Mom, I'm coming home to you Break it down. My name is Jimmy, his name's Greg Buehl Me, him and you we went to the same school This ain't cool I'm in a rage He's tappin' my mom We're almost the same age On the microphone, I drop bombs Look at this car! Thanks a lot, Mom "Here, happy birthday, Rabbit" "Here's a brand new car, you can have it!"

I don't want to hear shit about it. I'm signing you up. Man, don't. Come on, man. You got to battle! Future, I'm not you, dawg. Look at me. Listen. Once they hear you, it won't matter what color you are. You win some battles, Three One Third will have the street credit we need. With you and me as the anchors. Did you hear that Wink has been talking to that promo guy? Yeah, I heard that bullshit. Wink is scandalous, dawg. Could be a shot. You know I'm trying to get straight with the Lord, so I don't like bringing too much negative into my positive world, but Wink is just talking shit. There'll be no action, just talk. Sweet home Alabama Got a cigarette? The dude mentally ill? Car accident, man. He's supposed to get some big settlement check soon or some shit. Will you hurry up with that thing? Try it now. Give it some gas. That's what I'm talking about, baby. We're going out tonight. Tonight? Yeah... Fuck last night. Okay? Forget it. What about being straight with the Lord? Come on man, it's Saturday. I can get straight with him on Sunday. Hey, B, I got these new beats, man. You know how much I like your mom... Shit, I really, really like your mama, Rabbit. But she did you no favor when she left you this car. Fuck you. Get out and walk. Hey, man, at least the radio plays. What's up with this whole East Coast/West Coast thing?

I'm fucking serious. I get claustrophobic. You were scared! You were scared! No, you were scared, motherfucker! Do you know how many abandoned buildings we have in Detroit? How can you have pride in your neighborhood with shit like that next door? Does the city tear them down? They're too busy building casinos and taking money from people. Shut your preaching ass up. Nobody care about that shit. Did you care when the crackhead raped that girl? You think it would've happened without an abandoned house? They caught him, didn't they? Yeah. Dumb motherfucker went back to the house. How stupid could a nigga be. What's happening under that hood? It's a just a short. Chill out. I ain't getting back in that piece of shit. It's a death-trap. I think Jimmy's mom's trying to kill him. Yeah, she's so goddamn fine, she could kill me. Don't be saying shit about my mom or my fucking car, man. I hear everything. He a ninja now. B-Rabbit!

Talking about your man Sol I kick you in the chest Pork chops fall out your asshole You cats is pussy Soft like wet flowers Leadaz Of Tha Free World Here to smash you cowards Look at Future... Don't start, nigga. What are you going to do, faggot? Who you calling a faggot? Don't play yourself, bitch. Hold on. Yo, Elvis. You don't want to step to this. You need to take that white ass rap back across 8 Mile. Caught your choke act at The Shelter last night. Oh, shit! What are you doing? Put the shit down. Come on. Pull out! Be cool. Chill, chill. Come on. Yo, Iz, it's cool. It's cool. Yo, come on, man. Let's go. Come on. I should fuck you up, Cheddar. What the fuck were you thinking? "Fuck Tha Free World?" Future said it! It's at the Hip-Hop Shop. Leadaz Of Tha Free World. Hip-Hop Shop, Wednesday night. Come on down. It'll be your only opportunity to blow both of us. After we go platinum, you won't be able to get to me and Future. Why do they call you Future? I had a lot of names, the most conceited kind. I was Maximum, Brimstone, Godfather D, Devastatin' D. Big D, that has a double meaning. But none of them worked, till I started hosting the battles at The Shelter. One day somebody said, "You know what? You are the future of hip-hop in Detroit." So you see, baby, sometimes you got to find your name and other times, your name finds you. Want to smoke some ganja? That's our problem. If we don't respect our sisters, who will? We're doing it to ourselves. He's my brother. He don't like pussy. Rabbit, teach me to write rhymes. That's how to get the ladies, right? Let me out. Hold on. Yo, I'm sorry, dawg. I didn't know Papa and LC were on their bullshit until tonight. I wouldn't be with them, except I'm promoting a show with them at Hip-Hop Shop. Those Free World bitches? See what I'm talking about? Look, they're just one of the acts. If you want, I'll step out. You're my friend. I don't want you mad. Man, do what you want to do. Yeah, do what you want to do. Respect yourself, sister. God damn. Don't you ever shut up? Why you got to push me? Damn, Future. What the hell is his problem? Future? Yeah. He thinks sometimes you talk shit. Who's he to say what's real? 'Cause he hosts the battles? Ain't that Janeane? I thought she was pregnant. Pregnant? I'm out. I'll be outside. By myself. Here's your chance, girl. Go ahead. You're Jimmy Smith, Jr. My name's Alex. You find the guy you was looking for? What guy? At the plant. That was my brother. I was borrowing a car. I hear you're a real dope rapper. A "dope" rapper? Yeah. Who told you that? You know, it's around. If you're so dope, why are you at Dead End Stamping? Your brother works there. My brother's a loser. And you? I work at intermezzo, saving enough to get out of here. Bussin' dishes is much better than pressing bumpers. I won't be there long. Where are you going? New York. I won a modeling contest. A judge said he'd help me out. I just have to get a book together. What if he ain't for real? All I'm looking for is a ticket. Rabbit! You and your friend want to bounce to an after-hours spot? "Rabbit." Let me ask my friends. Where are we going? My house. What about your mom? Working nights. That's the after-hours spot? Heck, yeah. Can some of us ride with you? Why do they call you Rabbit? He's fast and likes to fuck a lot. Get your hand off my balls! Why are you being so ignorant? Jimmy! What's wrong with you? My bad, you guys. Are you signed? Not yet, but I'm working on something for him. He'll record a demo at MCA. Really? Yeah, but I was... if you want to see Jimmy flow, come to the battle at The Shelter. He's the best! Shut up. When is it? Friday night. Yeah? Can I come? I'm not battling next Friday, dawg. You will if she's there. You want to be the man. All right. Just don't push. We all need to be pushed sometimes. My bad. I'm sorry. You gonna let him push you? You can't catch me and you never will! Out of my way, freaky girl! - Wipe your feet. - Hey, wipe your feet! You like? She's getting out of the D, though. Negro, please. That's what they all say. No, I think she's different. That chick really blew both you guys? I'm a sinner, James. Come to church with me in the morning. I saw you talking to Papa Doc in the Chin Tiki. How do you know him? You mean Clarence? He went to Cranbrook with Christine's brother. You want to dance? Not right now. Fucking Wink. Trying to keep us in division with that fake-ass Big Willie wannabe talk. Nothing wrong with a free demo. Free comes with a dick up your ass. Three One Third is real. What Wink is talking about is wack. Another example of people's needs being denied by the city. The media should be all over this. It'll happen again. The city don't give a fuck. What is he talking about? The abandoned house where the girl got raped. It's called an "attractive nuisance." It wouldn't still be standing if it were on the other side of 8 Mile. It could have been Lily. Burn this shit down to the ground. That's what I mean. Fuck, yeah, man! Burn this fucking thing down! This is the definition of an attractive nuisance. Come on, let's burn this bitch. Right behind you. That's what I mean. I thought I had matches. You got my lighter? - I gave it back to you. - I got one. Wait, what are you doing? No! What the fuck, you guys! I'm gonna fuck you up, Cheddar! Burn! Hey! I burned the house down! The roof, the roof The roof is on fire We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn Burn, motherfucker, burn! It's almost beautiful. When I was little, I wanted to live in a house like this. You know, how it used to be. You live with your family? I got out of there as quick as I could. I left home when I was 17. What about you? Sort of the same. When you record your demo, I'd really love to be there. Hey, girl! ls it hot enough for you? You're going to be great. I got a feeling about you. Let's go, Alex. I'll see you. See you. Cheddar, bring your ass on! Come on! Pesky mosquito! Let's see. Oh, yeah. "And the mirror said, 'Not you, Queenie."' Shit! What's wrong? We're being evicted. God damn it! Come on, Mom. Not in front of Lily. I can't let Greg find out. Fuck Greg. I'm three months late. We got 30 days to get the money. "We?" if you want to live here, you got to start chipping in. Where's Greg's settlement check? Get the money from him. I can't. He's going to ask me and Lily to move away with him. Some place nice real soon. I can't freak him out... Mom, stop living your life like this! If you cared about Lily, you'd get a job and quit fucking around. I got to go. I'll be late for work. What are you doing with your life that's so great, Rabbit? Wink's working on a deal where I can get free studio time to record my demo. Yeah. Right. Bye, baby. Alex Latourno Hotter than an inferno Hotter than a crack house Burn internal Up! Down! Why does Manny give me so much shit all the time? Maybe because you give him reason to. Stick to the plan, man. Just do your work and shut the fuck up. Up! Down! Why haven't you called? Janeane, I can't talk here. You'll get me fired. I'm your girlfriend. No, you're not. We broke up. I'll call you later. You just left without saying a word. I left you the car. Was it 'cause I said I was pregnant? I know why you said that bullshit. You have to go. I didn't know what else to do. Tell me why you left and I'll leave you alone. It's not you, okay? It's me. It's my shit. I had to go. Why? What are you running from? Nothing! Would you just go! Everyone's calling you a loser from the other night. Who is? Everybody's talking about it. How you froze up and got booed offstage. Fuck you! Go home. What was that all about? Sorry, Manny. It wasn't my... It won't happen again. Good. Don't be bringing that shit around here. Now get back to work. Rakim was the first rapper with complex lyrics. But as far as beats and lyrics go, Biggie is the bomb. I can't believe y'all talk about complex shit and leave out 2Pac. Fuck 2Pac! Nigga, you crazy? Pac's the only lyrical motherfucker out there! He's right. His shit has emotion. What about the Beasties? Fuck them. How can you even bring them in the mix? They bust some serious shit. Those white boys are more like busters on serious shit. I won't bump no Beasties. But it's always easier for whites to succeed in a black man's medium. Right, B? Word up. It's true. - What are you doing, man? - Rabbit! Oh, shit. - Don't worry, Rabbit. - I got your back! Hey, what's up, B? You want to fuck with us? Get off me. What the fuck you gonna do, motherfucker? Come on, man! Let him go. You want to fuck with us? Fuck with us, yeah? What the fuck are you doing? Where'd you get that shit? It's my mom's. Put it away before you fucking kill somebody! Papa Doc had one! Put it away! Man, put it down. Come on. Okay. Fuck, man. Oh, shit! What the fuck? Oh, shit! Let's get out of here. Shit! We got to get him to a hospital. - Where are the keys? - Get the car! I got to put pressure on it. Try not to think about it. My God. He shot his fucking dick off. Did I? Man, shut the fuck up! Take Gratiot to McDougal. I live here, too. I know how to get there! Then do it! Rabbit's going to teach me to write rhymes. What were you doing with a gun? What were you doing with those fuckers? I have a show with them! Calm the fuck down, y'all! MC Bob. What? MC Bob. What do you mean? Is that a good name? What's wrong with Cheddar Bob? I like MC Bob. Right? Yeah. MC Bob. I got that fat man out of Mickey D's. Roy's going to interview him at JLB and I'll be there. It's gonna be on! The doctor said he hit an artery, but he'll be okay. That's good, man. Where were you? Praying. ls he all right? Let's go, man. Wink told us how he got in with Roy Darucher. That shit's hot, man. He's doing an interview down at JLB. Why are you listening to this clown? What? You heard me. Clown. Why you got to be like that? This is a good deal for him. It's for real. It's for real? Like the time you said your cousin worked for Dr. Dre? Or the time you were real tight with the intern in Russell Simmons' office? Or how about... Shut the fuck up! Why are you always giving me shit? Is it because I'm making moves? Or because your ass is stuck hosting battles for two years. You're a fucking loser. Who are you calling... Yo, chill! What the fuck? How can you fight about this shit now? I know what you're trying to do to our group. Suck a dick! You little bitch! Back down! Cheddar's in the hospital and you fight about this? So fucking stupid! Forget this car, B. I'll give you a ride to work in the morning. I'm afraid you've made a mistake. I don't have any colored girl in my class. There's Sarah Jane. There's my baby. You mean Sarah Jane Johnson? Yes, ma'am. I'm Mrs. Johnson. - Sarah Jane? - I brought you these... You win at bingo tonight? No. You record your demo yet? What happened to you? Cheddar Bob had an accident, but he's fine. I'm fine. You and your friends. Mom, don't start, please. It's been a long fucking night. Tell me about it. Me and Greg are having problems. He found out about the eviction? No. The settlement check ain't coming. No, it's coming. It's our sex life. I don't want to hear this shit. I mean, it's good. It's real good. But he won't... I don't want to hear this! Greg won't go down on me. Mom! Hey, Sol. Ever wonder at what point you got to say, "Fuck it"? When you got to stop living up here and start living down here? It's 7:30 in the morning, dawg. Thank your mom for the car. All right. I'm getting so sick and tired of fucking with this steel They only give us 30 minutes to eat lunch and chill My body aching just to get a buck I'm sick of eating shit off this fucking lunch truck Nasty-ass food I'm in a nasty-ass mood Should have called in sick Shit, I had somethin' to do!

No insurance, the medical establishment will fuck you. Where else would he be? Just thank God he's alive. No, thank God he didn't shoot his dick off. That's why brothers need to get a deal. Record labels supply niggas with benefits. Dawg, we get a deal, you can take the fucking benefits. We'll have Bentleys and Benjamins, not Blue Cross. I don't give a fuck about that. I just want to hear Three One Third on the box. One of them songs on JLB. We need to save, put it into savings bonds, and build our own studio. - Savings bonds? - Let me ask you something. How are we brothers? We need fine bitches and phat rides, not savings bonds. All we ever do is talk shit! "We need fine bitches and phat rides." "We need to invest in savings bonds." "We need to get our songs on JLB." Shut the fuck up! And we never do shit. We're still broke and live at home with our moms. I'm out of here. Catch you later. Get your mad, rambling ass in the car. I hope you get a new ride soon, Rabbit. Maybe for that birthday tripping ass. I'll call your mama. See what I can work out. I got shotgun, Shabba. Get in the back, Farrakhan. Why are you pretending to be asleep? I seen you out the window, Bob. I didn't feel like talking. Why not? I didn't want them making fun of me. You know what I'm saying, Rabbit? Yeah. You do? MC Bob. Like you see in magazines. What up? Hey, Rabbit. Where have you been? You call him Rabbit, too? I gave him that nickname. Stop it. I did, when he was little. He had buckteeth and big ears. He was so cute. Like a little rabbit. Right, baby? I got good news. You brought her to my mom's? What the fuck? I invited her to my show. She said we had to come get you. What was I supposed to do? I've been helping Al find a photographer for her book. All she keeps saying is how much she likes you. Damn! Now check this, dawg. I heard from my man Roy today that he's gonna be at JLB tomorrow night for the interview with Big O. So what? So what? I told him about your skills! I said, "Rabbit's your man." He said, "Bring him down. Let me see what he can do." if it goes well, you could be flowing at 54 Sound next week. Can you get your shit together in time? I can do it. My bad, man. No problem, dawg. Big time, Jimmy. Why'd you take off? I don't really live here. So? Why'd you take off? I just... Don't be embarrassed about where you live. I don't live here. What's up with you and Wink? He's helping me get my book together. Using his connections. Same way he's helping you out. So... You have to stay home tonight? Yeah, I should work on some songs for my demo. Okay. Your mom's getting evicted. It says right here. "Tenant must vacate the premises due to non-payment of rent." You know about this? Morning. Sweetie, you want cereal? I was talking to your precious son about this eviction situation. Did you plan on informing me? Honey, that's a mistake. You're a fucking liar. Hey, man! Stay out of this, Rabbit. Don't worry. I'm taking care of it. Don't. Fuck, man! What is your problem? Don't touch my mother! Stay out of it! I'm out of here. I can't go out with someone like you. You gonna let him say that to you? With two homeless kids. Motherfucker! Rabbit! Jimmy! Please! Stop it! Stop! Fuck you! Rabbit, stop! - Fuck you! - Stop it! Oh, my God. Lily. Come here, baby. It's okay. Come here, baby. It's okay. It's over, baby. What up, dawg? Alex just called. I got a friend to take pictures of her when she gets off work. She needs a ride, that's why she called. Can you drive? I'll drive. The others will be here soon. Sol's mom's dropping them off. I hear you're battling tomorrow. I'm doing what? Someone told me Future signed you up at The Shelter. Who told you that? What up? Wipe your feet. Nobody's wiping their feet for your junky basement. Where your mama at? Working. Dear mama! Tell her to hang this shit upstairs. Did you sign me up to battle tomorrow night? You heard me. Don't play fucking stupid. Did you? Papa Doc won last week, so he'll be defending his title. You got to take it from him! You win battles, you get respect. I don't give a fuck! I'm sick of you thinking you know what's best! You ain't my fucking father! I'm a grown man. Look, Jimmy... "Look, Jimmy" nothing! Fuck you! I told you not to sign me up! So you want to fight me now? You ain't the future of shit. You're just David fucking Porter. Hey, come on, fellas. You know what? Do what the fuck you want to do. I don't give a shit any more. I really fucking don't! You coming to JLB tonight? I don't know, man. I look like crap. If I knew it was today, I wouldn't have gone drinking after the show. I can reschedule. No, I'll do it. You will? I'll always do it. When will we see your pictorial in a magazine? Pictorial's in Playboy. In fashion, it's editorial. Shut up, Frederick Douglass. It's for her book, so she can get a job. That's one book I'd definitely read. It'd be the only one. Don't forget this. Thanks, guys. Want me to come up? That's okay. Mom. Mom, come on, get up. Come on. Greg left me. Damn! Get up. It's okay, Lily. It's okay, honey. His settlement check came in. His settlement check came in. And now that he's got money, he can't be with somebody like me any more. It's Thursday. I got to go to bingo. Maybe he'll be there. You ain't going nowhere. You're better off without him. Stop it! It's your fault he left me! You ruined it! You fucked it all up for me! Who's gonna want me now? Where are we gonna live? We don't have any money! We don't have anything! What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? What are you gonna do? Lily's out there by herself! Why do you have to be like this? What'd we ever do to you? Get the fuck out of here! Get the fuck out of my house! Get the fuck out of my house! - Come on, baby. - Put your coat on. We're going next door, okay? We're getting out of here. What floor is JLB on? Twenty-eighth. Thank you. You're welcome. When we look at Big O, what are we looking at? - I'm giving you poverty, slums. - That's where I'm from. So I put it all in the music. I'm looking for Wink Harris. Who? He should be here with Roy Darucher. I think they're all in Studio B. Thank you. I did anything I could for free, just for the exposure. No doubt. Big O, big ups and congratulations, playboy player. You finally got your record on the radio. How do you feel? - Much love, man. - I want to thank you and WJLB for looking out for me like that. That was much love. I'm just trying to put Detroit, the East Side, on the map, you know? We're gonna do it for real, man. I hope we'll get a pipeline through here, and the industry will look at us and sign us. We'll all be eating. Stop it! I've seen you flippin' burgers! Yeah, I did that. I thought I recognized your face. I know you been... Stop it! Please, Jimmy, stop! How long you been in the game? Roughly 15 years. It's an honor for me to come on and have you do this for me. I really appreciate it. No problem. We're here to represent the D, take care of our artists and take care of home. I hope you have a successful career 'cause I know you're puttin' it down. You represent real hard for the 313. I'm doing it for y'all, man. This is for Detroit, 313, baby! Love! Thank you, Mrs. Helgeland. Any time. Have a good night. You have fun? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I know. I want you to go inside and lock the door, okay? Listen to me. Go in, lock the door and I'll be in in a minute. Okay. Okay, go. Go! What up, bitch? Ready to get knocked out, dawg? Wink said you lived in a trailer with your mom. But we didn't believe him. Come on, Elvis. Get up. Get up, bitch. Get your faggot ass up and fight! What? What the fuck you looking at? Jimmy! Get the fuck up. Stop it! Fight me, you punk-ass bitch! I could end your shit right now and nobody would even miss your ass. No, no. Don't do this. Come on. He's done. Free World, motherfucker. Don't forget to come to The Shelter tomorrow night. - You little faggot. - I mean, little Rabbit. Jesus. What happened to you? I fell. You fell? I fell. Come on in. I'll make you something to eat. What? I'm your mother. I want to make you something to eat. What's the big deal? I thought you wanted me out. You want the fucking pancakes? What's gotten into you? We're not getting evicted. Why not? I went to bingo. And I won! $3,200! You're kidding me. Nope! Our luck's finally changing around here. Did you mean it about doing the demo with Wink? No. I'm gonna do it on my own. You know, Rabbit, I think that's the best way. Hey, Smith! Hey, Smith! Are you all right? I fell down some steps. You been doing much better here. Still want the extra shifts? Yeah. You got them. I need you to work tonight. I'm a man short. Tonight? Is that a problem? No problem. Good. Get back to work. Manny! Thanks. What up? Shit. Waiting on this slow-ass ride. What are you still doing here? Someone's sick, so I'm filling in. She ain't waiting on me. I'll be back. What do you want? I wanted to say goodbye. I'm going to New York. Yeah? And... Can I give you a ride or something? No, I'm cool. I'm working overtime. Saving up for something special? Yeah, studio time. Good. Good for you. I was hoping to see you at The Shelter tonight. But, if you're afraid... I ain't afraid of them guys. I didn't say you were. Bye. Paul, would you mind covering for me for a couple hours? I can do that. Thanks, man. I owe you. It's Rabbit! Hey! Rabbit, wait up! What's up, man? What happened to you? - You straight? - Look at your eye. I'm fine. Wink said you blew up 'cause Roy Darucher said no to your demo.
