OK, so I want that over there. And you can put that right there. And what's that red Christmas thing again? Uh, this would be a Christmas poinsettia, Lady Valerie. Exactly, poinsettia. Can you put that right there? And can you also just put the Christmas wreath right on this wall? Yes. OK. Here we are. Very well, there we are. Ah, there. Oh, perfect. My followers love my workout pictures. Oh, uh, speaking of pictures... maybe we can put a picture of me right in the center of this wreath. What do you think, Henley? I think it's marvelous, Lady Valerie. Why leave an empty space anywhere when a picture of you could fill it? That's exactly what I was thinking. See? I knew you'd get it, Henley. Play "It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas." Ah, that's better. Now that Thanksgiving is behind us, we can all focus on my favorite time of the year. I can only guess. Christmas! How did I know. Ah, yes. All this decorating has me exhausted, Henley. I'm going to go downstairs, take a nice hot bath, and relax while you all finish up around here. And this workout has me so famished, I will take my breakfast after my bath. Oh, and Henley, remember, no dairy, no meat, no soy, no sugar, no carbs, and especially no gluten. Thank you, Henley. You're the best. MARY Good morning, Mr. Rich. Is something wrong, Mary? MARY No, sir. I was just trying to tell you that you have someone here waiting for you. I didn't realize. Is Lauren out front? MARY It's not Lauren, sir. He looks like some hotshot lawyer. He says he works for AV Camel, and he wants to discuss the Rich Family Haven. Great, what violations did the shelter break now? And how much is it going to cost me? You know what? These people wait until the holidays every year to hassle me. Send him in. And if this meeting is going past 15 minutes, please interrupt us so I can find a way to get out of here. MARY You got it. - Thank you. Call mother. My darling daughter, I've been meaning to phone. How are you? Hello, mother. I'm well. MOTHER How's your dating life? Seeing anyone new? I'm still dating Tyson. You remember, the rapper. Still with a hobby boy? Mother, that's not why I called. I was calling about Christmas and all of us in Aspen? MOTHER That's what I've been meaning to tell you, my darling. I'm afraid I won't be able to make it. Charles has surprised me with a trip to a private Island in Fiji for Christmas. We're double dating with Warren and Astrid. Right, Charles. It's always Charles. MOTHER You and your father always enjoy your time together on those little excursions of yours. I promise I'll make it up to you. Sure, I guess. MOTHER Perfect. Well, I have to go, honey. We're having breakfast with the hotel tycoon Avery Calhoun and his wife. I hear they're making millions converting old, useless properties into luxury hotels. You know how I just adore talking about new money. Ciao, darling. Mother loves you. Bye, mother. Lo... Hello? Hello? Thank you for stopping by. I'm going to have my attorneys look it over. And we'll talk soon. Sounds good. Excuse me, Mr. Rich, but you're really needed for, um, you know, that thing. And, um, we really need to get you office decorated. It's super important. Come on, ladies. Put the poinsettias over there. We need another Christmas tree, maybe a small, little snow globe. Mary. Mary, he's gone. But Santa came early this year. Play "It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas." Oh, ho, ho. Mary, hold all my calls while I look over these documents. OK, no problem, sir. My god, you know what? Stay. Decorate everything. You got it. Make it feel festive. Oh, just put love in the building. Lashes on. Hair laid. Got a million dollar face. I'm the baddest on the block, yeah. And I say beat to the gods. Yeah, I speak to the gods. Beat to the beat, to the beat, to the gods. Yeah. Yeah, I'm beat to the gods. Beat to the, beat to the. He's in, right? All right, everybody out. Thank you very much. Happy holidays. Good morning, Mr. Rich. Mm-mm. Did anybody tell you how good you look this morning? I'll take that as a compliment, mister. Take it as a fact. OK, you need to stop before someone catches us. Let them catch us. OK, as your business consultant... OK, all right. I think it's time we do a little rebranding. OK, oh, no. Well, we don't need to rebrand. Rich Enterprises is doing better than ever. That's not what I mean. What I'm talking about is finally letting people know who you are, what your values are, your purpose. I'm talking about going back to the basics. Oh, gosh, I don't get it. I know, which is why I've got a little surprise for you. All right, let's see what you got. I'm Barbara Harriet. And this is my Christmas edition of Spotlight On, this time featuring DC's own Marshall Rich of Rich Enterprises. Success is not guaranteed and failure is inevitable. But for this man... Excuse me. BARBARA up is up and down... Uh, that's not what we're doing. OK, would you just be patient? You're going to love it. I promise. BARBARA Because Marshall Rich does not lose. Oh, this is the good part. BARBARA He built an empire that started with a tree. Really happy about this. BARBARA the Rich Family Haven, a shelter for families in need. - Oh. This is amazing. You know what? BARBARA And now has grown into, well, a... I don't like it. OK, what just happened here? I don't want... I don't want to do this. I don't want to be highlighted. Marshall, this was supposed to be a surprise. Remember when I told you that people need to know who you are? Well, they also need to know how much it is that you do for the city. That's not what I wanted. I don't want to be highlighted like I'm some Saint Santa Claus. But Santa is a saint. Well, I'm not. But I appreciate your effort to highlight me and Rich Enterprises, but I got to be honest, as of today, I had an offer that I cannot refuse. I'm selling Rich Family Haven. And the deal is going to be done the day after Christmas. You can't be serious. OK... Yes, very serious. And that news segment will make me look like the Grinch that stole Christmas. I don't understand. Do you realize that closing The Haven will displace a lot of families? As your business consultant, I advise you reconsider. I knew you would say that. And I would never do that. The new buyer is going to create a new and improved building for the residents. It's a temporary thing. Yeah, right. Listen, Haven is not what it used to be. The community hasn't shown interest in that place in years. And it's the only location that is not bringing in the donation dollars that it used to. I cannot continue to assume the cost of keeping that facility up and running. It's just a really harsh thing to do, Marshall, especially around the holidays. I know. So why not go out with a bang, right? How about... just hear me out. Hear me out. How about we spend Christmas at Haven giving out gifts, food, mingling with the residents. Can you arrange that for me? Do I have a choice? And we could relocate families to other locations. It'll all work out. Trust me. So now what? What happens to your annual daddy-daughter Christmas trip to Aspen? Well, we'll have to cancel. And Valerie will spend Christmas with us. She will be a little upset. But you know, I know how to make it up. I don't know if I'd use "little" and "upset" to describe Valerie when she hears the news. I know my daughter, Lauren. Do you? Yes. Well, speaking of knowing your daughter, when do you think you can tell her about us? Maybe that way we don't have to sneak around like disobedient children. She's old enough to know the truth, Marshall. OK, didn't we talk about this? We have a thousand times. I know. I know. And Valerie is very sensitive to things. So I will tell her when the time is right. And I have a lot of calls to make. So tonight, we can meet at my place, right? Maybe. Maybe? You should come, but you have to go. Can you close the door when you leave? Di... Mary, hi. Can you put me on with, uh, Avery? Come in. Mm-hmm, Lauren will handle the clothing. And on Christmas day, we will make Santa anxious of the job we do there. Uh-huh, yeah, perfect. Perfect, bye. Hey. Finally, Daddy, I thought you were going to be on that thing forever. No I never keep my princess waiting. You look so nice. Also, I have something to discuss with you. I've already heard. You and that little pitchfork wielding consultant of yours, Lauren, are somehow already trying to plan my holiday white party. Yeah. Uncle Walter told Serenity. This is our daddy daughter trip, and it's finally my year to host. Why is she even involved? Who? Lauren? That's not what this is about. That woman has been trying to hook her claws into you for some time now. She's after our money. Our money, huh? OK. Have a seat. I have a surprise for you. It's not that surprise. Oh, OK. So what kind of surprise is it? I haven't been this excited since Luciani's winter release in Milan. Don't remind me. Oh, my God, I had to pull back your allowance after that. That's not it either. You ready? I am selling the rich family haven, the first one, anyway. Dad, that's not that much of a surprise. I picked up Tyson there the other day, and that place is a dump. Of course you're selling it. OK. Haven is not a dump. Oh. Whatever you say. I'm not the one closing it. OK. So anyway, I am closing the haven the day after Christmas, which means we're going to have to cancel Aspen. And I want you to be there with me, because we need to be a united front. Daddy, you cannot do this to me. This will ruin me. I won't be able to show my face anymore. I'm going to have to go into hiding. Oh, my god. Maybe even get a new identity. What... hold on. Listen, breathe. Breathe. It's OK. Breathe, sweetheart. It's going to be OK. It's just really good people there. You're going to be quite helpful. Listen, you used to love it. You'll be fine. Valerie, come on. Valerie, remember when you were a little girl? You used to love coming with me to the haven. It'll be a lot of fun. Everyone will be in Aspen this year. Tiffany and Serenity are expecting me there. Well, you're going to have to tell them you won't make it this year. You have got to start focusing on other things. Like, what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what do you want to be? Well, I guess if I thought about it, I would be a professional socialite. That is not a job. Elaborate. I'm listening. Well, I've always thought of myself as a socialite. And as a professional socialite, I can make a difference by, you know, like when I go into events and I can talk to people. And just like for business purposes, I can totally just, like... Daddy, you're a bully! I mean, why would my dad want to ruin my life and my reputation? I cannot be caught dead walking into that place. You walk into Tyson's little shack. What's the difference? I will not let you hoggers talk about my boyfriend like that. Tyson is, yes, the struggling musician. But soon, he'll be a renowned artist like Basquiat or Jay-Z. You're just single and jealous. She's right. You are single. Please, Tyson is barely a boyfriend. He's broke, broke, broke. And more broke. The only reason you're dating him is to upset your mother. What is old mommie dearest during these days anyway? The usual. Rubbing elbows with the elite and traveling the world with Charles, cocktail in hand. Maggie doesn't change. No, don't change the subject. What are you going to do when you need money? Or have to bring him around, like, real people? I'll just get him a job with daddy. Doing what? I don't know. CEO or something. Duh. Can we get back to the matter at hand? What are we going to do to convince my daddy to change his mind about Christmas? Don't know. But in your absence, I mean, it's only right that I step up and in. I'll throw the holiday white party. I mean, it makes the most sense. I'm the better event planner anyhow. We'll see about that. I'm going to throw the largest event in Aspen since, well, the last event in Aspen. We'll see about that. Val, can I talk to you over here for a moment? Yes, what's up? I heard my dad and uncle Marshall talking, and I really think uncle Marshall means business this time. I think you should sit this one out. Listen, you don't understand. My dad hates to disappoint me. All I have to do is go over to his house and butter him up. He'll be wrapped around my little finger. It's like taking candy from a baby. If you say so. I do say so. Stop. But, daddy. Please, I'm your little girl. Valerie, you are not a little girl. Are you kidding me? I said no. We have more important things to do than skiing and schmoozing. But, daddy, I love schmoozing. Especially schmoozing with other schmoozers. I'm getting a headache. OK, OK. You're right. I'm an adult. So how about you stay, and I go? All I need is a credit card. OK, how about this? You figure out a way to get your own money, then you're off the hook for the closing of the haven, and then you could do whatever you want for Christmas. OK? Daddy, can I borrow some money? Listen, I am not having this conversation anymore. Fine, then I'm not having it any more either. Don't I do enough? Please please, please, daddy. Who was that? Hey, Marshall. Hey. Valerie. What is she doing here? Oh. So nice to see you too, Valerie. Don't you nice to see you Valerie me. I know you're the one who probably put this little idea in my dad's head, you daddy stealer. That's enough, Valerie. First of all, Lauren is my business consultant. She has nothing to do with me and my decision of closing the haven. OK? She ain't stealing me. Ain't nothing going on between us. I'm leaving. Oh, God. My daughter is something else. No. No, no, Marshall. You are the one who's something else. What did I do now? Nothing. That's the problem. I don't understand. Oh, my God. What are you talking about? Did we not make an agreement that we would keep this between us? Yes, Marshall, we did when we first started dating. But this isn't a relationship. Come on, we kiss when no one's watching, we stay in instead of going out. You lie about our business relationship in order to keep us in the dark. Lauren, my daughter is... A grown woman. Marshall, you know what I'm starting to realize? You aren't doing this to protect Valerie. You're doing this to protect yourself. You are using her so that you don't have to commit to me. You know what? Let me tell you something. I am no one's little side piece, especially not yours. Lauren, I would never... I am done. Lauren. Lauren, I just... I just need more time. Lauren. Shnookiepants! Come here! What did I tell you about calling me that in public? What are you talking about? There's no one here. It's safe. Now, come here. Who's my Shnookie Bear? Who's my Shnookie Bear? I am. I'm your Shnookie Bear, girl. Hey, we got business to attend to. I think it's been enough for the PD, you know what I mean? Come on, man. That's a hard knockout. Oh. My bad. So, White Mike, it's my baby Valerie. My boo, my Mrs. Claus. Say hey, Val. Hi. So, like, why do they call you White Mike when you're like the exact opposite of white? You know what? Forget it. So nice to meet you. Shnookie Bear? I mean, Tyson, can I speak to you alone for a minute? Sure. OK, let's go. OK. What's up, boo? Am I really Mrs. Claus? Well, I told you, I'm your man. I'm going to give you everything. And my album going to pop, and we going to have the world. I'm so glad to hear you say that, because I really need your help. Yeah, what is it? Daddy has to work for Christmas, so he canceled our trip to Aspen. And it's my year to host the annual White party. And I just have to be there, Snookie. I have to. OK. So what do you need from me? Just, like, $50,000. 50,000? Didn't you say you and your dad is loaded? I mean, you don't have the money, big baller? I mean, not exactly. I don't have access to my trust fund for another few years. And ever since I bought at Luciani's winter line in Milan just that one time, Daddy put a limit on my credit cards. Snookie, are you going to help me with the money or not? 50 big ones, now that's a lot of dough. And money a little tight right now, you know, until the album drops. So, I mean... But you just said that the album will take care of us, and we won't have to worry about daddy or his money. Oh. Oh, I see. Wait, what? I just thought that you'd be able to do one thing for me since I'm your boo boo bear and all. Boo boo bear? What's up with the nicknames? Y'all are a little weird. Mind your business, man. You are my boo boo bear. Yeah? You're not acting like it. OK. I have a plan. Remember when you told me about that safe in your dad's office? Daddy's emergency fund? Yes. How much money you think is in there? I don't know. A lot. Oh. If you're thinking what I think I think I'm thinking... If it helps, I'm thinking it too. We need to stop thinking it right now. What? It's the only way. You got a point, right? It's the only way. We can borrow the money we need, and then when the album take off, I mean, we'll replace the cash before your father even know what happened. Come on, man. That boy smart. He knows something. I don't like it. What? It's genius. I mean, otherwise, I got enough dough for us to cut some coach tickets to Colorado. We can kick it in an Airbnb right outside of town. You know, my man, White Mike got the 2.5 customer star rating. I do got that. I do got that. I mean, we practically VIP with that. You feel? No doubt. Airbnb? We're not doing that. OK, then we get it from your dad's safe. Baby. Well, this is an emergency. Right. It's an emergency. And daddy did say that if I got the money on my own, that it'd be OK, right? Yeah. He did. He sure did. He said that. OK, let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Yeah! Wait. OK. You promise that you're going to replace the money before daddy finds out, right? He promise. It'll be easy. Piece of cake, baby. Come on, this shit is sweet. My little mastermind. OK, let's go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are we going? Where are we going? To daddy's safe, duh. Damn, already? OK. Yo, White Mike, let's go. We got the world, baby. Look, I'll explain everything outside. You just make sure you bring your car. Ready? OK, let's do this, baby. You guys look like burglars. What are you wearing masks for? I mean, technically we are burglarizing a joint. But we don't want everybody to know what we look like. You're going to rob number four. Snookie, I really don't know about this. Hey, White Mike, give us a minute. There's nothing to be scared about, Snookie. When the album drops, we just put the money back. OK? You'll text me the password, and I'll see you in a second. You... Huh? What are we doing? Brother, look. Stay low. What are we doing? See, I'm looking right here. Come on, man. I'm too nervous for jokes. Hey, they got some money in here. Look at that, brother. Wow, what? This might be it right here. Oh, what? What! What! Turn that light off, for real! My bad, man. I'm going to need the code right now. Come on. Hurry up now. What, you dyslexic? Come on, now. Yes, sir. Yeah, baby. Yes, sir! Yeah. Hey! Hey! Yes, sir. Get that money. Get that money. Slam dunk it. Yes, sir. Give that to you too. Yes, sir. Hey, Benjamin. Holler at me, baby. Let me talk to him. Hey, Benjamin. Hey, Benjamin. Yeah. What's up, baby? No, no, no, no, no. What? We got to take more than that? Come on, man. I know there's way more than 50 K here. He won't even notice. That's what I'm saying. He not going to notice. And if he do, who cares, right? Exactly. It's a robbery, we ain't got no compassion. Yes, sir. Perfect. OK, now. Let's go. Right behind you, dog. Let's do it. Let's do it. I'm right behind you. Yes, sir. That nigga tripping. Oh, baby need new shoes. Mama need new purse. Right behind you, Mike. Girl, I will rob your daddy any time. Listen. I really think that we messed up. We should probably just put the money back now that no one saw us. What did I tell you? Everything is fine. Girl, we didn't touch a thing. And what's done is time. I promise you, your father is not about to find out. What's done is done, right? Yes. Aspen, here I come. Yeah! My dad owns half this county, and when he finds out what you're doing, you're going to be a big trouble. I cannot believe I let you guys talk me into this. Relax, boo boo bear. When they come asking, I'm going to take all the responsibility for this, OK? I got you. You better, Tyson. Oh, damn. I guess you're not Snookie no more. Did you guys use your phone calls to call Tiffany and Serenity like I told you to? Yeah, as a matter of fact, this fool did. Hey, how are you going to use both of our calls for yourself? Like, you got some nerve. Wait a minute. While we were playing receptionist for you, who did you call? My dad, duh, but he didn't pick up. Course he didn't. Oh, might as well get comfy. As soon as my dad gets my message, he'll be right here. Girl, he ain't coming. It's been days. Where are they? Relax, jailbird. Alright? We've only been here a few hours. I can't survive in here. I feel like the room is closing in on me. I can't breathe. I think I'm going to pass out. Daddy, I'm so glad you're here. Guards, get the door. Not so fast. Sit tight. I'm going to deal with you in a minute. And for you two. One of you better start talking, and talking quick. Mr. Rich, sir, my name is Thurgood Thomas, and I've never been in any trouble before. In fact, I just got my degree in biotechnology. So a girl like Valerie could never be interested in a good guy like me. So I became whoever she needed me to be, even if that meant taking money from her father for her. She promised she'd replace it. Now, look, I know what we did was wrong. And I'm... I'm ashamed. Are you kidding me? What a bunch of crap. It was all their idea. They made me. Daddy. No, we didn't. And what about you, little thug? What do you got to say? And before you say anything stupid, it's all on tape. Well... well, sir. What can I say? I too am ashamed of my actions. You have some nice stuff, though. Ain't going to lie. You're doing well for a black mean. You're doing well. Quiet. Do you know you're in serious trouble here? Serious trouble, Valerie. Since my money was returned, I dropped the charges against you. But it's over between you and Valerie. Not a problem, sir. I need to stay away from bad influences anyway. Thank you. Hey, OG, one time. Since he came later, right? Don't push it. You're right. You two getting off easy anyway. And for you, I don't even know what to say. I'm at... I'm at a loss for words, Valerie. I am so disappointed in you. I can explain, I was just trying... I know what you were trying to do. But the problem is it was the wrong thing. And I am tired, Valerie. I am tired of dealing with your childish behavior. It's time for you to grow up. Now, I worked out a situation with the court. You could spend the next 30 days working and living at New Haven, or you could spend your next 30 days in jail. And I'm not talking about this. I'm talking about a real jail, like Prison Break, or Straight Outta Compton. Daddy, 30 days? That's cruel. So what will it be? I guess I can't wait to see those little angelic haven faces. And I took your car, and I canceled your credit cards. But wait, how am I even supposed to get there? I am going to give you $100. I suggest you use it wisely. Henley will deliver your things to Haven. Daddy! You losers. Your music sucks. Oh. Hello. I'm Valerie Rich, daughter of the Marshall Rich, owner of this. Good God, you guys should really fix up around here. Oh, what is it already, lady? I'm watching my soaps. Can you just take me to my room? I can't do that. I'm on break. It's not the Ritz, lady. You just don't snap your fingers and get a room. Did you not hear me? I said my daddy owns this place. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on here? This little prissy wannabe come waltzing in here talking about she owned the place, demanding beds and such. OK, well, I'll handle this. Why don't you take a break? You must be Valerie. My apologies, miss Rich. Finally. I just need to go to my suite. Oh, we don't have any suites. But we do have a room set up for you, and I had Joyous, one of our residents, place most of your belongings into the room. There was quite a bit of stuff, and doesn't leave much room aside from it. My apologies. We're just so glad to have you here. We could really use your help. That's great, but I won't be here for long. My dad is just trying to teach me a lesson. And as soon as he calms down, I'll be out of here. OK, well, whatever the reason, we still appreciate your help while you're here. Your room's this way. Follow me. Here you go. FYI, the Wi-Fi is extremely sketchy here. Doesn't work half the time. But for phone calls, there's a community phone in the family room. I won't be needing that, but thanks. Why don't you get settled? So glad you're here. Oh. Oh. Serenity? Tiffany? Oh! Call mother. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. This is Madison Monroe. Ciao, baby. Daddy! Call Lauren. OK, all right, perfect. Mr. Rich, how can I be of service? Hey, I just wanted to update you. My attorneys looked over the contracts, it's all legit. We are going to move forward with the sale of the haven. OK, perfect. My firm will take care of everything per usual. OK, Lauren, I want to ask you something. I just want to say that I'm really sorry about the other night. And I'm kind of struggling here. I don't know if I was too hard on Valerie. What do you think? OK, so your 25-year-old daughter, who doesn't work, or virtually do anything, yet lives a very lavish lifestyle, thanks to the allowance you provide, stole from you. I repeat, she stole from you, Marshall. Now, you're a very intelligent man, and already know what you need to do. But then again, I am just your business consultant, so what do I know, right? Look, it's really busy here now. Is there anything else that I can assist you with? Yeah. You know, no, I'm OK. I'm good. I'll talk to you later. Bye. What is this, bootcamp? Here at the haven, when it's time to get up, we get up. OK, just please stop banging. You're messing up my morning zen. OK. Meet me downstairs in 15 minutes. Put on something comfortable. Thank you. Oh, this is looking good, ladies. Right in time for Christmas. Thank you. That was 30 minutes, not 15. Anyway, nice ponytail. Don't you dare say anything. Haven't you guys ever heard of a blow dryer? Couldn't find one for the life of me. I haven't worn a ponytail since grade school. Let's see, I'm going to have to show you what dress comfortably around here means. You sure you don't want to go back and change? It's going to be a long day. All right, let's get this tour started. So this is our community meditation room. It's basically the most quiet place in the haven. If you ever want to just get away and relax, and you know, think. Oh, I don't think that much. Oh. Wow, you could have fooled me. I know, right? You're a special one, aren't you? I am. At least that's what people tell me. OK, well, come on. I still have to show you the daycare, the common areas, the maintenance closet, and the residents living. Do we have to? I still have to organize all of my clothes. My butler, Henley, he must have been in a haze, because he completely forgot to coordinate and separate all of my clothes and wardrobe by color and designer. And I have to do it all myself. Oh. The nerve of that Henley, imagine that. I know, right? Well, unfortunately you got to do that on your own time, because there's still more to the tour. Africa wasn't built in one day, you know. I think you mean Rome, and neither was this haven. Which is why there's so much to show you. Come on. Right this way. Good morning. Now this is what we call the chow line. Oh, this reminds me of good days. I think you mean good times. We've got some good times. Perhaps you should keep a little bit of that excitement to yourself. I mean, speaking of things that we should be keeping to ourselves. I think this is something that you should... Should have kept to yourselves. I'm so sorry. The cafe is a great place to get to know everyone. People are definitely more open to talking on a full belly. No. Thank you. Remember, I'm not going to be here for much longer. Come on, it'll do you some good to socialize. Take a look at that family over there. Take a closer look at the dad. I mean, he kind of looks like the action trilogy star, Joyce Jones. It's not looks like. It is. No. Oh, my God, how? He used to be so famous. My dad loved his movies. Bad investments, not enough work, and too proud to ask for help. Super sweet guy, but it happens. So many stories like Joyce. The Presses over there. What's their story? Mr. Press is a retired teacher. And Mrs. Press is a retired dancer. They were scammed out of all their retirement and savings. The cops couldn't do much for them, and couldn't afford an attorney to look into it. No kids, no family. The rest, you know. My God, that's horrible. I didn't even know things like that happened. Oh, you'd be surprised. All right, let's move on to the rest of this tour. Come on. So, you can always come into the family room to chat or get to know some of the residents. During the day, it doubles as a day care. So, what do you think? Isn't it great? I really don't know why you're showing me any of this. I'm leaving. Yeah, I know. But you're here now, like it or not. Listen, I do not want to meet or see anyone else. And before you stick me with one of those babies over there, my dad will be here to pick me up. I can guarantee you it. OK. If you say so. My Luciani. OK, all I need you to do is stand here, use this cookie cutter, cut the cookie dough, and place it onto the baking sheet. OK? Just like this. Wait. That's it? Yeah. Oh, I can do that. Easy peasy. Slow your roll, MasterChef. I'm going to see you in a little bit. Things are looking good, Levi. Thank you. Excuse me. What kind of cookies are these? Those are whole wheat oatmeal raisin cookies. Whole wheat? As in gluten? I guess. Oh. Your face doesn't look so good. Oh, you should get that checked. Oh. Good thing your butler packed that epipen. You're looking a whole lot better now, though. Really? Mhmm. Hey. Hey. I was wrapping up for the night. Any updates? Lauren, do you think I'm a good father? Oh, gosh. Marshall, I have told you a thousand times what I think. The real question is, what do you think? Well, well, well, I didn't get this far in my life lying to myself. So I do know my daughter Valerie is a brat, a spoiled brat, but she's my brat. But I didn't realize that my sweet little boo is not just so sweet anymore. I have a question that I've been wanting to ask. What ever happened between you and Valerie's mom? Where do I start? Well, a few years after Val was born, I opened my first shelter, Rich family haven, it was one of my dreams of course. And that is because when I was a little boy, my parents went through some financial troubles, and we had to stay in a shelter. So things were bad. My dad wasn't allowed to stay with us, because back then, it wasn't acceptable for men and women to stay at the same place, so they split. And it was one of the hardest times of my life. I had no idea. Yeah. But one of the things about it was, you know, I made all my dreams come true. I had my first shelter, I got married. I was happy, in love, I had a baby girl. I thought everything was perfect, and then Maggie divorced me. And she said I wasn't ambitious enough for her, and she wanted to chase her dream. And she did just that. She left us. She married into old money, and moved out of the country. When she did that, it just only complicated things. And at that point, I decided I would just give Valerie the world, you know? And in hindsight, I really feel like I just was pacifying her, and trying to protect her, but at the same time I think it was I was trying to protect myself, because it was the first time in my life, I realized that I failed at something. And that was my map. Marshall, you aren't a failure. I have no idea how a mother could abandon her husband and child that way. In fact, I'm kind of feeling a little sorry for Miss Wannabe Hillary Banks. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Too soon. But I couldn't help myself. That was pretty good. Thank you. I needed that. But honestly, I miss you. I do. Marshall. I've got to go. Good night, Marshall. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. Daddy, please. I know you've been getting my messages, how long are you going to leave me here for? I'm your only child, and you just throw me away like an old pair of Christian Louis Vuittons? And for who? A liar named Thurgood? No. Stupid Wi-Fi. Where did she say the community phone was again? Excuse me, do you know where the phone is? Thank you. This is Madison Monroe. Ciao, bella. Mother, I'm in trouble, and I need you to come save me. Daddy canceled my trip to Aspen. He accused me of being ungrateful, and he forced me to stay at the Rich family haven. You know, the first one. I mean, he literally kicked me out of my apartment, took away my car and my credit cards. Mom, I mean, mother, can you please come save me? Please don't disappoint me. There you are. Girl, I've been looking everywhere for you. For what? You people have been working me like a pair of platform shoes on a Saturday night. I have had enough. And I am leaving. You people? You know, I said I wouldn't let you get to me. But you are a spoiled, ungrateful, narcissistic Grinch who Stole Christmas brat. I cannot believe that you just said that to me. You come in here with your designer clothes and luggage, that even if sold used, could still house and feed a small community for months. You call what you did work? Work is trying to figure out where you and your children will lay their heads at night. Or even better, how you're going to feed them in the morning when they wake. Work is taking on as many jobs as humanly possible. And still not making enough money to give your child a real gift for Christmas. You wouldn't know anything about that. I may not have grown up with a diamond spoon in my mouth, but I've never been a thief. I've never stolen from anyone, let alone my own father. Yeah. I know all about that. I can't believe you came in here acting like you were better than the rest of us. You know what you should do? Take a look in the mirror and address what got you here. And ask yourself why no one is coming to get you out. You have no idea what you're talking about. Look at you. You sure do say we and us a lot, but guess what? You get paid to be here. How do you give back when you leave this place and you go back to your life? Well, since you must know, the haven helped me find housing and get on my feet. That's why I'm here. This play saved me and my little girls. I had no idea. Yeah. You don't look like... Like what? Like I was homeless? Yeah. Well, what did you expect? I don't know. Not someone like you. You got a lot to learn, little girl. Open your eyes and look around. You will not judge these people. This may be temporary for you, but this is the harsh reality for all of the families here. You have the opportunity to brighten the holidays and encourage the residents while you're here. But if you're too good for that, then please by all means, go. These people don't deserve to be overlooked or looked down upon by anyone, especially by the likes of you. Wait. You're right. I'll stay. It's not about being right, it's about doing right. Think about that. Tomorrow we start bright and early. Good morning. Good morning, y'all. Good morning, Carolyn. Good morning, Valerie. Is everything OK? Perfect. Actually there's one thing. Yeah. I knew it. What is it now? I was wondering if there were any more Christmas decorations lying around. I would love to make the family room a little bit more festive. Oh. Yeah. I mean, there are some boxes in the family room with holiday decorations. If you want, you can have at it. But just don't ask me to purchase anything. What you see is what you get. OK, have a good morning. You're welcome. Good morning. Eggs? OK. You're welcome. Stop! I need your help! Please stop! I said I need your help. OK. Now, you need to help me with this project, or I can write personal letters to Santa about each and every one of you explaining why you should be on the naughty list. Now, which one is it going to be? Oh. Good. OK, now you, little one. I need that over there. And you, I need that right there. And can you pass me that wreath? We got things to do. Perfect. So we're going to hang this somewhere really special. That way, anyone that steps up to it can just stick their head right in the middle of it. Hey. Why aren't you decorating? Because I hate Christmas. Just leave me alone. No one hates Christmas. I mean, you can hate what someone gets you. But you can always return it and get what you do like. Yeah. What if you don't get anything? Then what? What are you talking about? Who doesn't get at least one gift for Christmas? You're not the sharpest knife in the drawere, aren't you? I don't get it. Christmas gifts aren't really a thing around here, in case you haven't noticed. I was listening to my mom and the other parents, and they said the shelter's clothing. So now my mom and the other parents have to figure out where we're going to live. So I don't think we're getting much for Christmas. Well, where's your dad? He died. It was, like, everything was perfect when he was around. I wish he was still here so he could make it all better. Jeremy. That's my mom. I have to go. This is fun, right? Let's see what you got on this list. Honey, Santa might not be able to make all of this happen. Remember, Santa has a lot of kids that he has to take care of. So we don't want to be selfish and ask for big gifts, right? Why can't I ask Santa for my football gear? Daddy always let me play. Honey, we talked about this, OK? Remember, daddy is gone. And mommy just doesn't have the money to get you all of the things that you need to play. But soon we're going to have our own apartment, and you're going to have your own room. And won't that be exciting? No. I'm sick of this place, mom. No one plays football here. I miss my friends. I want to go home to my old room, with my cleats and my football. I want my daddy back. Jeremy. Jeremy, wait. Wait. I'm sure your family is going to come, OK? Don't worry about it. Is everything OK? Great. Come on. As house manager, it's my job to know when something's wrong with one of our residents. Talk to me. I don't know. I'm just really starting to question a lot of things in my life. Hey, can you tell me what you know about the haven's closing? What? Uh-uh. I have some free time. Let's go to my office. Sure. I have nothing better to do. Let's talk. You know, my mother left me and my dad when I was little. Closest thing that we've ever had to a relationship were the postcards that she would send me when she's traveling around the world with her husband Charles. That never stopped me from trying to get her attention. You know, I would... I would try to look like her, act like her, dress like her. I even dated guys that I knew she would hate. And still... OK, but you're not her, Valerie. And that's a good thing. The person you just described sounds selfish and cold. And that's not you. Well, maybe a little bit. No, but, seriously. Today I witnessed a different person. You were kind and helpful. The choice is up to you. You want to be your mom, or do you want to be Valerie? Thank you, Carolyn. I appreciate this, all of it. Don't mention it. And you asked about the haven's closing. All I know is it's temporary. Your father assured me that the new owner, Avery Calhoun, will reopen the haven as soon as the renovations are complete. Just hadn't had a chance to tell the residents yet. I've heard that name before. What? Where? My mother had breakfast with him and his wife the other week. I remember her telling me that he was known for buying old properties and turning them into luxury hotels. He even offered my dad a hefty amount for the Avon. Wait, that doesn't make any sense. If he's our buyer and has no intention of reopening a haven, then we're screwed. Your father... No, no, no. I'm sure my dad doesn't know. He would never sell the haven knowing that it would close permanently. I have to do something. OK, before you go Olivia Pope on me, can't we just call your father and tell him what we found out. No. I have to prove to him that I'm not just some spoiled brat. I'm a Rich too. OK. I have an idea. But I'm going to need your help. I'm in. Let me hear it. Great. It is. I do. I tried. Set yourself up. I really did. You're finally getting it together. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Carolyn, we need to talk to you. And you too, Valerie Rich, we know who you are, and we know what's going on. OK, can everybody calm down? Joyce, what are we even talking about here? Everyone knows the shelter's closing, and you two have been working together to cover it up. Yep. How could you and your father do this during the holidays? So I guess it's true. I wanted to believe that that little article was a lie. But I guess not. What are we supposed to do? Wait, what article? I read an article in the real estate database that I still have access to. I was a real estate agent once upon a time. OK, and what did this article say? Basically the asking price, and that on December 26th, this place would be under the proud ownership of its new owner, Avery Calhoun. Now, Valerie. Get Mr. Rich on the phone and let him explain himself. OK. Everyone just just listen. I'm Valerie Rich, and I understand that you don't know me personally, but I'm not a bad person. And I know that you're not bad people either. You've just had some bumps and turns and misfortunes that's led you here. And I understand that you might feel like the world has turned its back against you. But I promise you, it hasn't. If the haven is closing, we have until Christmas day to save it, OK? I have an idea, but I'm going to need all of you guys to participate. Go on, tell them. A rich family haven runway fundraiser event on Christmas day. We can turn the family room into a stage, and we can raise enough money to outbid the new owners. Oh, girl. I thought you had a real plan. I mean, do you know how much money we would have to raise to do that? And we don't have the resources for that. And obviously you don't either, or you wouldn't be here. OK, hold on. Yeah. We need to all hear Valerie out unless someone else has a better idea. Yeah. I didn't think so. Go ahead, Valerie. Listen, I may not have the money. But I know a ton of people who do. That's true. Joyous, I want you to be the emcee for the event. OK. Mrs. Prancer, I want you to teach everyone how to walk the runway. Mr. Prancer, I want you on community outreach. We need people to fill those seats. And Cheryl, with all your experience, I need you to put together an offer for my dad to consider. And everyone else, I just need everyone's participation. Are you all in? You know I am. You know I'm in. Yeah, I'm with it. We're in. Christmas is in 14 days. Starting tomorrow morning, we start saving the haven. Save the haven. OK. Are you ready? I guess. So, we have about two weeks until Christmas. We start here. We separate everything that we need for the runway show. And then we just auction off the rest. Damn, girl. How do you even sleep in here? I don't. We're going to need a ton of boxes, and a ton of tape. Wow. You like it? I love it. And I love this. Nope, that's not for you. You can't have that, sorry. Wow, you have really outdone yourself. Oh, my gosh. This is great. Oh, my God. We're going to save the haven. Next, yes, girl. One more time, let me see it, let me see it. OK. There you go. Look at those hips swinging. Serenity, it's me, Valerie. Don't hang up. I need your help. Henley, remember when you told me you were top-rated chef? Show time. Valerie, well, look at you, hi, mama. Merry Christmas. Thank you. I try. Merry Christmas to you too, Carolyn. Oh, I just came back from the cafeteria, and everything's prepared for the runway fundraiser. And your chef Henley just finished preparing all the food. Perfect, the guests should be arriving soon. But first, I wanted to do this. No matter what happens today, I wanted to help. So here. What? What is this? There's a card in there with an attorney's name on it for the Prancers. I've already paid for their retainer and everything He's great at what he does. And he's going to look into what happened to them and get their money back. There's another card in there for Joyous. I found an agent who is super excited to get him back into acting. She said that she already found the perfect role for him. And the envelope is for Cheryl. I wanted to use it to get her and Jeremy out of here. Did you use the money from selling your stuff for our residents? Yes. And before you ask me why, or tell me that you can't accept, let me just say this. All of this has really made me think about my dad and how I don't know what I would do without him. As for the money, tell Cheryl or anyone who asks that it was a private donation. Tell them Santa sent it. And here. This is for Jeremy. This is really, really amazing, Valerie. But I think you need to give this to them yourself. I mean, they need to know that you did these things. No. It's better this way. You know, what you've done here, Valerie, is amazing. Your father is going to be so proud. He's going to be in love with the new haven. Oh no. Oh no what? I need to make a phone call. Can I use your phone? Yeah, yeah, of course. Tell everyone to get in their places. If the guests start to arrive. Just have them seated. And tell Henley to start the hors d'oeuvres and the cocktails. I will be right there. OK. I am on it. Hello? Operator? Yes. I'm looking for the number of someone. Take their seats, please. Thank you. All right, Carolyn. Are we ready? I say so. It's getting pretty crowded in here. Get up there. You got this. I bet you can't see that. Without further ado, I'd like to bring the woman up who made this all possible, Miss Valerie Rich. Thank you, Joyous, and thank you everyone for arriving. I know today is a special day for a lot of you. So I'll keep this short and sweet. Today is Christmas. And normally for me that means my daddy daughter trip to Aspen. But this Christmas, my plans got interrupted because I made a really bad decision. And it wasn't until I met some of the residents at the Haven that I truly understood what Christmas meant. It's about caring and giving for those who deserve it the most. And in some cases, those who don't even really deserve it, like myself. The Rich family haven has been a staple in this community for 20 years, helping and keeping families together and out of danger. But now, there's a new luxury hotel that threatens its existence, as its new owners plan on closing the haven's doors forever. But you all are in the position to do something about it. Today, you can give the haven what the haven has given us for 20 years, support. Today, you can support the haven by digging into your Santa bags, and helping us reach our goal of $3 million. Damn. These people got $3 million? Now, without further ado, please enjoy the runway show, sponsored by my good friend, Luciani. Thank you, Merry Christmas. Now, you heard Miss Rich. We need you all to go in those pockets and those wallets while we get into a couple of these new looks. We call this Rich family haven Christmas runway fundraiser. Hit it! If there's anyone up there, I just really miss my dad. And I wish I could just tell him that I was sorry, not because I got caught, but because I really disappointed him. And he's the last person that I would ever want to disappoint. And I just want to tell him that I finally get it. I just wish I had my dad again. Talking to yourself now? Daddy. Hey, sweetie. I'm so sorry, daddy. I was disrespectful to you, and I was horrible to you. I deserved everything that I had taken away from me. Do you forgive me? I've been here for a while, and I heard everything you said. Selling your clothes to help the residents get back on their feet, this fundraiser. I'm so proud of you. It couldn't have been easy. And yes, I forgive you. But I need you to forgive me too. For what? You haven't done or anything. That's the problem. I didn't do anything. I was so busy just building and making the best deals that I didn't even pay attention to my own family. And then when your mother left, I should have just been there for you instead of pacifying you with money and gifts. And I didn't, because I was hurting too. And I'm sorry for that. Well, if this isn't everything I never expected to see. Mother, what are you doing here? Yes, what are you doing here? What do we owe the pleasure of this rare sighting of the one I call Aggie Maggie? I have always hated that moniker. And yet you insist on using it, as if it was some sort of embarrassing label. Well, I've always loved it. It describes you perfectly. Aggie, describing loosely, what, agitated, aggressive and always annoying. All the emotions you evoke whenever you're around. Likewise, darling. And although I would love to go round for round with an old contender like you, I ain't here for that. Oh, no? No. I'm here to rescue my daughter, who has been forced into slum living in a shelter by her very own father. I get it. So, did Valerie's life somehow interrupt the life of the socialite? Were you embarrassed or concerned when you found out? I am here because I am her mother, and she has summoned me. I'm here to save you, darling. She ain't the one that need to be saved. Oh, I beg to differ. Look at you, you sad Santa. What is it, thickie Richie? All right, well, Merry Christmas to you Diana Ross with no supremes. Please. Valerie, gather your things. Better yet, leave them here. This place is so unsavory, let's just go. Your father clearly isn't up to this. I should have taken you with me years ago. You got a lot of nerve, Madison. Mother. That is not 100% true. I have not been honest about my role in all of this, and why I'm even here in the first place. Well, what? When I did call you last week, and I did actually need your help, you were late, per usual. I guess I should just be happy that you're even here in the first place. Valerie, that's so unfair. No. What's unfair is you leaving daddy for riches, and then you leaving me as well. What's unfair is you traveling around the world with Charles, and not even having time to spend with your own daughter. What's not fair is me spending 25 years of my life trying to be just like you, for you to just throw me down the wayside. But, darling, I never knew you felt like this. And I never would have intended to make you feel unwanted or neglected. Well that's funny, because you surely never made me feel wanted in the first place. I'm not trying to upset you, but I love this haven. And I'm not ready to leave yet. Daddy, Avery Calhoun is going to buy this place and he's going to turn into a hotel. And the residents will have nowhere to stay. I understand that you want to sell it, but it's just not the right thing to do. Valerie. We did it. We did what? We saved the haven. After you left, all of the people were just throwing in donations. And we got a ton of donations online. You did it! See? Daddy, we did it. Daddy, we raised the money. You have to back down from the offer now. That's what I've been trying to tell you, sweetheart. Honestly, I didn't know about Avery's intention, but I signed a deal this morning I can't. It's done. I'm sorry. Mother, you said it yourself that you and Avery are really close friends. Can you just do anything about it? There's too many people relying on this. Well, I just don't know how I can assist. I mean, this was a deal executed by your father. I'm sure you've even already been paid. Yes. Can you just call him? Just tell him that we'll give him the money back. All we want is the haven. All right, well, let me try and make a call. Mother, there's there's actually no Wi-Fi. Oh, no, darling, there's always Wi-Fi when you have the right gadget. Avery? Madison. Yes, darling. Listen, I want to discuss with you that deal that just closed. Yeah, I would like to see if you could do that thing thing that you do when you do the thing thing, only in reverse. Oh. Oh, I see. No, no, no, of course. All right. Yes, that's fine. That's fine. All right, I'll see you in Fiji. Yes. So, is he going to give the money back? Well, of course he is. No one ever says no to Madison Monroe. Marshall, expect a call from his attorney to reverse the whole transaction. All right. Oh, wow. Oh, well, nice, nice, nice. This has been lots of fun, but I really must go. Can't you just stay for a little bit? You know what? I see this is about to be a personal moment, so I'm going to see you all inside. Thanks again, Valerie's mom. You're welcome. Yes, Maggie, why don't you stay? Have dinner with us. Oh, I would really like to stay, but I can't. You see, I only came to pick up Valerie, and since she's decided to stay, I've got to go. I can't keep the jet waiting, darling. I'm not doing this with you anymore. You either stay here and you spend Christmas with me, or you leave. And you stay gone forever. Valerie. I'm so proud of you. You really are the best part of me. And I love you. But I can't stay. I'm sorry. Madison, think about what you're doing. Think about Valerie for once. Mother, did you still plan on flying me somewhere for New Year's, or did you make other plans again? I thought so. Just leave, Madison. Tata, love. I'm sorry, princess. It's OK. I'll be fine. Now, I have to say this. The woman that I've seen all day, I'm extremely proud of. Do you understand that? And I got a Christmas gift for you. Really? Yes. Tada. Open it. What is it? I'm not going to tell you. You got to see for yourself. Yeah. Got your car back, all your credit cards, which I know you're excited about. But you earned it. Thank you, daddy. I have a Christmas present for you as well. Me? Don't be mad. But the other night that I left your house, I stayed outside eavesdropping on you and Lauren, and I heard everything. And I think it's about time that you stop hiding behind me. And you took another shot at love. Don't let your relationship between you and mom define you. So what are you talking about? Turn around. Oh, my God. Are you serious? Thank you for coming, Lauren. Thank you for inviting me. Daddy, Lauren and I worked out all of our issues. I think you guys should talk. I was foolish and I am so ashamed. Oh, God, would you kiss me already? It's Christmas. Of course. Hey, uncle Marshall. Serenity, I'm so glad you could make it. How could I say no? I did my best, in inviting some of my dad's hotshot friends, including Tiffany's dad. Did you see him with Tiff? I sure did. I am proud of you. The show was fab. And give me those shoes. OK. Bye, uncle Marshall. Go ahead, girl. Thank you, cousin. I know it was you. Thank you. Carolyn tried to say that it was an anonymous donor. But I pushed, because that was a whole lot of money. And she told me that you sold almost everything that you had just to help us. I don't know what to say, but thank you, Valerie. Girl, you did that fashion show, honey. That was everything. I still can't believe how we flipped that family room, right? Yes, girl. Teamwork. Teamwork. Yes. I'm going to be a football player. Santa bought me these cleats, and a new football. See? Santa shows up here, too. You're going to be an amazing football player one day. Give me a hug. OK. Come on, Jeremy. Thank you all so much. Today was such a good day. It's such a good day. Look at you. Valerie, I was so glad I was able to catch up with you. Tiffany never told me that you were so talented. I really could use a fundraiser like you on my team. I really could. Thank you. Oh, hi, Tiffany. I thought you'd be in Aspen partying. I canceled that trip. You know, you really could learn something from Valerie, instead of spending all my money over in Aspen, crying over that Tyson fella who dumped you. Daddy, you're embarrassing me. How do you think I feel? Merry Christmas to you. Merry Christmas. All right. You've witnessed an amazing show. So now, let's give it up for the woman of the hour, our Christmas angel, miss Valerie Rich. Thank you guys so much for coming out on Christmas day to help save the Rich family haven. I am so happy to announce that not only did we reach our monetary goal, but we successfully saved the haven from the sale. Now, before I close out, I would like to bring up our new co-owner of the haven up to the stage to take a bow. Miss Carolyn Sung. Yes, get up, come on. We're so proud of you. What are you doing? Giving you what you deserve. I had my dad sign it over to us. Merry Christmas. We're partners now. Now smile, and give the people what they want. Thank you, everyone. Merry Christmas, everybody, we did it! I'm so proud of you. Look at you! Thank you. Oh, give me some. Walk it out. Walk it out. Let them see you. I can't believe all of this. I couldn't just leave like that. Is the offer for dinner still good? Yes, mom. Mom. Snooker. Two hugs are better than one. Oh. Congratulations, Carolyn. Thank you. Thank you so much. I promise you I won't disappoint you. I know you won't. I have a surprise, I have a surprise. Come on, babe. I don't know. Wait. What? I can't take any more surprises. OK. Merry Christmas, everyone! Yay! Merry Christmas, daddy. Yes, Merry Christmas. The season brings the gift, the gift of love. The season brings the gift, the gift of love. Counting my blessings this Christmas. Give all the magic and cheer. Got everything on my wish list, not looking for presents this year. Only the matters of the heart, and how I love people for who they are. Because when we're together, we're better. This only happens once a year. Families gather here. And there ain't nothing better. It's the gift of love. Really don't need those material things, because they just don't hit like they used to. I'd rather wrap a bow for me and you, and savor the time that I get to spend with you. Give me that gift. Give me love, love, love. It's the gift of love. It's the gift of love. It's a gift of love. Now I love people for who they are.
