For more than 200 years... ...we Owens women have been blamed... ...for everything that has ever gone wrong in this town. Is that why people hate us so much, Aunt Frances? They don't hate us, sweetheart. We just... We make them a little nervous. Let's face it, Jet. We Owens women have always created a stir. It all began with your ancestor, Maria. - She was a witch. The first in our family. - Witch. And you, my darlings, are the most recent... ...in a long and distinguished line. Is that why they wanted to hang her? Because she was a witch? Well, the fact that our Aunt Maria was a bit of a heartbreaker didn't help. Nor did it help that most of her lovers... ...had wives on the hanging committee. But no, I don't think it was either of those reasons. They feared her because she had a gift. A power that has been passed on to you children. She had the gift... ...of magic. And it was this very gift... ...that saved her life. She was banished to this very island. With her unborn child growing inside her belly... ...she waited for her lover to rescue her. But he never came. No one came. In a moment of despair... ...she cast a spell upon herself: That she would never again feel the agony of love. But as her bitterness grew... ...the spell turned into a curse. A curse on any man who dared love an Owens woman. Here they come. Aah! So is that why Daddy died? - From the curse? - Yes, my darling. Aw, I got you. I got you. I got you. Your mother knew. She heard the beetle ticking for your father's death all day long. She knew that when you hear the sound of the deathwatch beetle... ...the man you love is doomed to die. But that's how you came to live with us. We tucked you into our lives then. We've raised you the best way we know how. In this house, we have chocolate cake for breakfast. And we never bother with silly things like bedtimes or brushing our teeth. But with the sweets... ...comes the sour. So when you find yourself the center of attention... Hi. You wanna play? It's not that they hate you. It's that, well... We're different. You witch! ♪ Witch, witch You're a bitch ♪ ♪ Witch, witch You're a bitch ♪ ♪ Witch, witch You're a bitch ♪ Gillian. Sally. You know, the only curse in this family... ...she's sitting right there at the end of the table. Your Aunt Fanny. Oh, come on, Jetty, even you have to admit... ...any man who gets involved with an Owens woman... - ...is bound to end up 6 feet under. - Spare me. What about my poor Ethan? - It was an accident. - It was fate. - It was an accident. - No, no, no. It was fate. - Accident! - Fate! Mommy died of a broken heart, didn't she? Yes, my darling girl, she did. Hey. My little witch... ...let's go inside and do some spells. - What about my homework? - Oh, pish! Tosh! You're both gonna learn things in this house... ...that you will never learn in school. Go, come on. - Let's go. - Go. - Come on, Gilly. - I'm coming, Sally. Very good, Sally. You know, you've been blessed with a gift. - What about me? - Oh, we don't worry about you, Gilly-Bean. - Your talents will emerge in time. - There. Sally, you just stay right there. Keep working on your spells. Just keep working on your spells. - Get the bird. - Get the book. I want him so, so much, I can't think about anything else. I don't sleep. I... He has to leave his wife. He has to leave her now. Perhaps you might find one better suited. No, I don't want anyone else. He's all I think about. Why the hell else would I come here? Take the money, Jet. Shh, shh, shh. I want him to want me so much that he can't stand it. Be careful what you wish for. I hope I never fall in love. I hope I never fall in love. I hope I never fall in love. I hope I never fall in love. I can't wait to fall in love. He will hear my call a mile away. He will whistle my favorite song. He can ride a pony backwards. - What are you doing? - Summoning up a true love spell... ...called Amas Veritas. He can flip pancakes in the air. He'll be marvelously kind. And his favorite shape... ...will be a star. And he'll have... ...one green eye... ...and one blue. I thought you never wanted to fall in love. That's the point. The guy I dreamed of doesn't exist. And if he doesn't exist, I'll never die of a broken heart. And if he doesn't exist... ...I'll never die of a broken heart. Sally. Get the door. Get the door. Wow. Sal, you have... ...no idea. Do you really love him? I mean, enough to marry him? Oh, come on, Sal, what's enough? I hate it here. I wanna go where no one's even heard of us. - I feel like I'm never gonna see you again. - Of course you will. We're gonna grow old together. It's gonna be you and me living in a big house. - These two old biddies with all these cats. - Ha, ha. I bet we even die on the same day. You swear? Honey, I need your pocketknife. Yeah. Here. Ow. My blood. - Your blood. - Ow. - Our blood. - Our blood. I love you, Gilly-Bean. Yeah. I love you too. Oh, good morning. Hello, boys. - Oh, Charlie, looking good. Ha-ha-ha. - Uh, oh. Oh, God, what was I thinking? Oh, Franny, let it go. Oh, my goodness, Gillian's in Orlando. She's in Orlando. Ah, I guess that Roto-Rooter man is history. - According to that, he is. - It's insane. - She keeps going through all these guys. - Hi. Hopefully, someday she'll find a guy who'll go through her. Hello. - Hello, darling. How are you? - Cover your eyes. Oh, Jet, just give it up. - Never. - God, I miss her. Oh, sweetie. Oh, dear. Oh, Samson. Now just knock it off. - That's all I want, a normal life. - Darling, when are you going to understand... ...that being normal is not necessarily a virtue. - It rather denotes a lack of courage. - Well, it's what I want. See this couple here? He's having an affair with the babysitter. And she can eat a pound cake in under a minute. - Ooh. Oh, sorry. - Come along, come along. Howdy. - Phew. What time is it? - Any moment now. Where are you going, dear? Most excellent. Dear Gillian: Today is our third anniversary... ...and all I have to show for it are two beautiful little girls... ...and a husband I just can't stop kissing. I don't even mind the beard. I wish you could see us. No more stones being thrown, no taunts cried out. Everything is just so blissfully... ...normal. Life is perfect. Dear Sal: I'm lying in the sun. I'm hanging by the pool. I've got a million friends. You might say that life is perfect. ♪ 'Cause I was too nervous ♪ ♪ To really get down ♪ But I don't care about any of it. In fact, I only have two words to say to you: Jimmy Angelov. Jimmy... ...Angelov. Angel. Angelov, Angelov, Angelov. Unh! Where are you? Where are you? Don't do this to me. Unh! Come on. Come on. - Hey, boys, you catch anything today? - Not much. All right. See you in a bit. Where are you? - Hey, Jimmy, what's going on? - Hey. I hear you. I hear you. Don't! No. - How's Mary doing? She good? - Okay. Yeah. Can't be. No. That can't be. No. No. What's that? I... Unh. I know you're in there. Come on. Unh! - Unh! - Michael, look out! Look out behind you! On your right! Out of the way! No. It was the curse, wasn't it? - He died because I loved him so much! - Oh, my poor little girl. We had no idea... ...when we cast the spell... What spell? What are you talking about? Oh. Oh, you didn't. You didn't. Please tell me that my own flesh and blood... It was just a little push. You wanted so much to be happy. We never expected that you would truly love him. Well, I did. And I want him back. You brought him into my life, you bring him back. Bring him back! I have never asked you for anything. I never asked for spells, but do this. You can bring him back. No, dear. - We won't do that. - We don't do that. You can do this. I know you can. I remember. I found it here when Mommy and Daddy died. Even if we did bring him back, it wouldn't be Michael. It would be something else. Something dark and unnatural. I don't care what he comes back as, as long as he comes back. Please do this for me. Please? Please, please! Please! This is only temporary so don't get too comfortable. There'll be no chocolate for breakfast. Homework will be done after dinner. Teeth and hair brushed before bed. And as for you two... ...my children will never do magic. Ever. Mom? It's time for us to go to school. Mommy. It's the same time as yesterday... ...and the day before that, and the day before that. Out of bed, sleepyhead! Mom. I'm worried about Antonia. Do you know she puts on her mouse ears, she drives around town all liquored up? Naked. All right, I'll see you around. - Come here, you. - Aah! Mmm. I'm sorry, baby. I'm just so tired. Mmm. It's okay, Mommy. Mm. Mmm. Gilly. Sally. I was just thinking about you. You're always thinking about me. Mmm. Honey, I just have to go to the bathroom. Let's go together. Jimmy, come on.

I wouldn't exactly call him my boyfriend. He's more, uh... He's more like a big mistake. - Is that his handiwork there? - Mm-hm. If a man hits me, he only does it once. Can I take a peek at your? Wow. Now, I can tell... ...that you've never touched a woman in anger all your life. - May I have my hand back, please? - Sure. What you're trying to tell me is you have no idea where he is? I told you. He hit me and I haven't seen him since. - And when was that? - Three days ago. - Right, Sal? Yeah, three days. - Three days? Excuse me. Uh... - Sally? Whose car is that in the driveway? - Hm? The one with the Arizona plates. - Oh, that's my car. - Oh, that's your car? - Mm. - Huh? Plate number 2-2-9-M-O-B? Uh-huh. That's James L. Angelov's car. Come on now. We... We stole it and it's a crime. I know this, but he basically kidnapped her. - And it... - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - He kidnapped you? - Well, no, no, he, he... He didn't really kidnap her. He sort of, like... Just a little nap. No, she was... She was... There was a car and she... Would... It... You know that thing... She... What happened was that she... She just... Heh. You should know, she has the worst taste in men. She... Ha-ha-ha. Well, you do. So... So anyway, I picked her up and I drove her right back here. And... And we would be so happy... ...to give him back his car because it is a crime. And... ...as you say, you just don't know where he is to... - You just got a little... - Oh. Give him back that car. So basically, nobody knows where he is. I'm sorry, what? - So you don't have any idea where he is? - Mm. - Would you mind if I just took a look around? - Unh-unh. Okay. What is wrong with you? I don't know. This young lady's name was Phoebe Stone. Two years ago, she was found strangled... ...lying on the side of the highway. Her body had been marked... ...with a kind of a brand burned right into the face. Any help you ladies can give me... ...in locating this ex-friend of yours... ...would sure be appreciated. Okay. She's all yours. Go arrest her! Their niece owns a shop where they cook up a special placenta... ...and that's why the aunts don't age. I tell you, they just don't age. - She's selling placentas? - A placenta bar. On Halloween, they all jump off the roof and fly. When they get mad at you, they hex you. I don't know about the Bulgarian... ...but I wouldn't be surprised if he turned up in a ditch somewhere. Sara, that is not true. She's not saying they murdered him. - Just that maybe... - Yes, I am. ...they shook his hand and then he died. It's very mysterious. If any man dared take on an Owens woman... ...he'd live briefly in the euphoria of her love... ...until meeting an untimely death. The curse. Witch? Yeah. Evil? No. I mean, you get your psychos now and then. Animal slaughter... ...ritual human disembowelment, but that's really pretty rare. See, it's a pagan label. It's Sally. - Hey, Sal. - Hey. Howdy. She's definitely not into that stuff. - She's not, huh? - No. Miss Owens, I have a bone to pick with you. - What can I do for you, Dwight? - Now... ...I could've gone to a qualified doctor... ...to attend to this scalp condition of mine. Now, the more I use, the less it works. The product doesn't work. Well, that's because it doesn't go on your head. If I don't put it on my head, where the hell else would it go? Try to remember. My mistake. - There you go. - Thank you. Strange town. I never spent this much on shampoo before... ...in my life. Am I under some kind of surveillance? Should you be? Well, if there's something you wanna know, ask me. Ha, ha. I already did. And all's I can tell you is, there appears to be something missing from your story. Now, listen, I wanna talk to you more, but I gotta finish some homework here. How's about I come by your house tomorrow morning? - Fine. - Okay. Ten a. M? - Fine. - Okay. That's a date. All right. Jimmy, is that you? Jimmy? Go away. Go away. Okay. To banish unwanted persons, it says you need blessing seeds. All right. Good. Where are they? - What about nigella seeds? - It's the same thing. Oh. Oh, wow, is it? Good, good. You're good at this. Why can't we tell Mommy we're sending the policeman away? Because your mommy likes to pretend that she doesn't do magic. And we have to banish this man for your mommy's own good. Blessing seeds. Right, right. What else do we need? Antonia, I told you to listen out the door for Mr. Hallet. Uh, blessing seeds, blessing seeds, right. Oh. Oh, yeah, milk thistle. I can't find anything here. - Was this Mommy's? - Huh? Oh, wow. Yeah. Where did you get that? "He can flip pancakes in the air." "He'll have one green eye, one blue." "Hear my call a mile away." Heh. Was it about Daddy? Uh, yeah. Yeah. But Daddy had brown eyes. You know, um... ...the truth is, this wasn't about your daddy. This was when your mommy was little... ...and she was trying to invent a guy who didn't exist... ...to protect herself. It's crazy. But... Oh. You know, she loved your daddy. Oh. She loved him very, very much. I can't wait to fall in love. Mm. Kylie. Kylie, listen to me. Do you, um...? Do you ever put your arms out and spin and spin and spin really fast? - She does it all the time. - She does? Well, that's what love is like. It makes your heart race. It turns the world upside-down. But if you're not careful... ...if you don't keep your eyes on something still... ...you can lose your balance, you know? You can't see what's happening to the people around you. You, um... You can't see that you're about to fall. Don't be sad, Aunt Gillian. - I won't let you fall down. - Aw. - He's here! He's here! He's here! - Shh. Make sure you tell him about breakfast. Go. You came for breakfast. We're having pancakes. Heh, heh. No, actually, I just came to talk to your mom. Great, she's having pancakes too. Come in, come in. - Do you have a gun? - Mm-hm. Can I see it? Mm-mm. He's here for breakfast. I have a question or two. - He's gonna stay! - Oh. Oh, good. Good work. Shh. Now go back out there and keep them away from here. Belladonna. It's a sedative. People put it in their tea to relax, calm their nerves. Some people also use it as a poison. Which people? - Witch people. - Aha. - Witches. - Witches. - Mm-hm. - I guess you found me out, huh? - Yeah. - Guess I did. - Mm-hm. - Mm-hm. You should come here on Halloween. You'd really see something then. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, we all jump off the roof and fly. We kill our husbands too. Or is that outside your jurisdiction? Do you have any idea how strange this all sounds to me? I got people telling me you're up here cooking up placenta bars... ...that you're into devil worship... No. No, there's no devil in the craft. So, what kind of... ...craft do you do? Mm. - Do I do? I manufacture bath oils. And soaps and hand lotions... ...and shampoo. - Mm-hm. And the aunts, um... ...they like to meddle in peoples' love lives. Magic isn't just spells and potions. Your badge? It's just a star. Just another symbol. Your talisman. It can't stop criminals in their tracks... ...can it? It has power because you believe it does. Wish you could believe in me. - Miss Owens. - Mm? Are you hiding James Angelov? Not in this house. Did you or your sister kill James Angelov? Oh, yeah. Couple of times. Antonia, could you make more of a mess? - Mom, I'm cooking. - I can see that. Hey, there. Did you ever see a saguaro cactus? No? Step aside, you. Well, you're about to. Wow. Unh. One stack of flapjacks... ...and goodbye, Mr. Hallet. He knows how to flip pancakes. - Oh, my goodness. - I assume you don't want pancakes. No, we want them. We want them, we want them. Be careful. They tend to use those as Frisbees. Can you ride a pony backwards? Backwards, forwards, sideways, you name it. Okay, first troll. - Look. - What is it? - A star. - No, I don't want it in my pocket. - This is not yours. - Oh, that's all right. Second troll. And if you're anything like my girls... Here. It'll keep you clean. - Well, isn't this cozy, huh? - Mmm. You're right. - Hi, Gary. - Hi. - I can call you Gary, can't I? - Heh. Why not? - Coffee? - You must try some of my syrup. - Here's the syrup. Here. - Yes, please. - No, no! - No, no, no! - Uh... - Yeah! - What the...? - Heh. Ready? Okay, go! - Whoo! Okay, yes! - Okay, you ready? Let's go. Well, I guess they didn't wanna eat that. I guess not. Ha, ha. Oh, wow. I've been looking for this. Um... - This is his party trick, right, Sal? - Yeah. - It's your ring, is it? - Yeah, could I have it back? - What do you two think you're playing at? - What do you mean? You better get yourselves a damn good lawyer. And don't even think about leaving town. What was in that syrup? We just stick to our stories. You know, no body, no crime. It's... Oh, I'm sorry. I'm feeling like shit. I'm not sleeping. I just... I, me, mine. God, Gillian, that's all you can think about. You. Hm? It's all about you. - I don't wanna fight. - Don't you walk away from me. I'm sick and tired of cleaning up your messes. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're always right, Sally. Oh, I'm just a mess. Just one big mess! Well, at least I've lived my life. And you hate me for that because it scares the hell out of you. Gillian, I don't hate you. Look at you. You spend all your energy just trying to fit in, be normal. But you'll never fit in, Sal. Because we're different, and so are your girls. You leave them out of this, okay? All my life, I have wished I had even half your talent. You're... You're wasting yourself, Sal! You know what? I want you out of here. I want you gone. Okay, fine. I'm gone. Good. What? What are you doing? Where are you going? - I'm doing the right thing. - No, no, no! You are not gonna tell him what happened. You know what's funny? The moment that man walked in, that's all I want to do. What are you gonna do, get down on your knees and beg for mercy? You want me to be true to myself, huh? Then watch this. Sally. It's the goddamn Twilight Zone. - It was Jimmy's ring. - Oh, really? I know you knew that, but I needed to tell you. Well, I was serious back there. You best get yourself a lawyer before you talk to me. I don't want a lawyer. All right. Come on in. Excuse the mess. Uh... I wasn't expecting company. You can have yourself a seat. Um, let's see what I'll need here. Oh, here. You don't need to look at that stuff. How many times did you read my letter? A few. I have to study all the evidence. Okay, you wanna sit down? This is the testimony of Sally Owens. March 8th, 1998. You gonna sit down? Where is James Angelov? I think he's in the spirit world. - You think he's dead? - No, I think he's haunting us. What evidence did you get from reading my letter? Did you or your sister kill James Angelov? Gillian didn't kill anybody. Gillian didn't. Gillian didn't, but you did? Huh? Did you? Sally, did you? What if I told you I did? What would you do? What, would you send me to jail for the rest of my life all because... ...the world was short a man like Jimmy Angelov? That's not for you or me to decide how he should be punished. He has to be held accountable. Well, he has been punished. He has? You really should get a lawyer's advice before we go any further. Now listen. I know you're in some kind of trouble. All right? If you will trust me, tell me what you know... ...I promise you... ...I will do everything I can to keep you from harm's way. - I can't, I can't, I can't. - I can't either, I'm sorry. I can't. One green eye, one blue. - I can't, I can't. - What? I have to go. I was born with it. Mommy. Sally. - I need you. - No, no, no. What? - What's going on? - I didn't do anything. Okay, okay. Go downstairs. Go downstairs. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Officer Hallet. Just looking at you makes me homesick. Tsk, tsk, tsk. What's wrong? Cat got your tongue? Shit. Someday you'll explain this all to me. What was that, Sally? I mean, that was him, wasn't it? - Is... I mean, is he gone, or what? - Yes. You killed his spirit, but I took his life. But I will tell you everything you need to know. How I did it, where I buried him. I'll tell you what I did it with. I'll tell you how I... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up. Hold on just a goddamn second, all right? One step at a time. I took an oath to uphold the law, all right? I thought I came here to bring in the bad guy because, generally, that's what I do. You asked me how many times I read your letter. I must've read it about 1000 times. I know now that it was your letter that brought me here. It was you. And I'm all mixed-up about that. The reason that you're here and you don't know why... ...is because I sent for you. When I was a little girl... ...I worked a spell... ...so I would never fall in love. I asked for qualities in a man that I knew couldn't possibly exist. One green eye, one blue? But you do. You're saying what I'm feeling is just... ...one of your spells? Yeah. It's not real. And if you stay, I wouldn't know if it was because of the spell... ...and you wouldn't know if it was because I didn't wanna go to prison. Yeah, well... ...you know, all relationships have problems. I'm right, aren't I? You don't know, do you? Well, why don't you do what you do... ...and I do what I do... ...and we'll see where we end up. - Okay? - Okay. Curses only have power when you believe in them... ...and I don't. You know what? I wished for you too. Yeehaw. I'm feeling very into sisters right now. Mom, can I have some cocoa? Where's Mom at? Mom? Come on. Oh, dear. It seems we've not arrived in the nick of time. Wow. I see our instincts are getting a little rusty. He's squatting inside her like a toad. And this is what comes from dabbling. You can't practice witchcraft while you look down your nose at it. I know. I know. Tell me what you want me to do, I'll do it. - We have to banish him. - Force his spirit back into the grave. - We need a full coven. - Nine women. Twelve's better. Do you have any friends? Linda. Hi, it's Sally. I'm activating the phone tree. Look... ...you know the stuff everyone's always whispering about me... ...the hexes, the spells? Well, here's the thing. Uh... - I'm a witch. - I got the best news. Sally just came out. What a fabulous affirmation. Apparently, her sister just got out of a bad relationship... ...and now the guy will not leave her alone. Oh, oh. Can you bring a broom? - Yuck. Gross! Sick! - Ew. Ew. Ugh! - I see headlights. - Mom! Mom, they're here! - Come on! They're here! - Mom! We gotta go in the kitchen. The kitchen. On the side door. Come in. Come in. It's so good of you to come. Hi. No, now's not the time to be shy. Come on in. Grab yourselves a spoon. You can stir right over there. Woooo... You just get right over here, you grab that spoon, you dig right in. - Now, doesn't that look great? - Ugh. I have to tell you, the fumes are great for the pores. Not to mention sealing his nasty spirit back into the grave. Once I was across town, my daughter had a nightmare. And I swear to God, I could hear her crying. There's a little witch in all of us. - Everything's almost ready, Aunt Jet. - Hey. Well, Sara, I didn't expect to see you here. Well, ever since I was a little girl, I've wanted to see inside your house. Well, thank you for coming. Is this okay? It's all I had. - Well, ladies, let's begin. - Yes. This'll be great. - I know, we just... - All right, ladies, pick a broom. - Form a circle. - Holy shit. Whoa. I've been strung out by a guy before, but this is... Sally? Sally? Would each of you pick up your brooms? Hold them at staff length... ...handle to brush. Remember that as we go forth... ...it is only with our hearts beating as one... ...that we can save the life of this child. Are we supposed to say this? Stop it. Stop it! We're killing her! Gillian. Gillian! Gillian. Fight this, you bitch! Oh, my God! Gilly, Gilly. Oh, God. Oh, God. Gilly. Gilly, honey! It's okay. I love you. Gilly? Stay with me. Just... Please. No. - Please, just let him take me. - No. No, you have to hold on. Gill, you have to stay with me. Gilly. Gilly. No, stay with me. Gilly, stay with me. Stay with me. - Gilly. - He wants... ...me. Just me. No. - Everyone will be safe. - No, no. Just let him take me. Oh, Sal. Don't die on me, Gilly Owens, please. Because we're supposed to die together, remember? At the same time. You promised me that. And this is not that day. I love you, Sally. Okay, wait. I've got it, I've got it. Get them back in the circle. Hey, Jimmy, I got a worm with your name on it. Yeah. You thirsty? Is this what you want? Well, this you can't have. My blood. Your blood. Our blood! Maria's blood. - Now! Push her in. - Push her in. I love you, Gillian. We did it. Heads up, ladies. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. I wonder if that would work on my ex-husband. Come on, ladies... ...let's clean house. - Get him out of here. - Get your brooms. - Come along, ladies. That's it. - Through the kitchen. - Follow me. - Very good. Well done. Sweep him to the roses. Sweep him in. Sweep him in. - Hey. - Yeah? There's something for you. From Arizona. "Dear Miss Owens: Any further investigations..." "Office hereby concluded that James Angelov's cause of death was..." "...accidental." "Jewelry found in the ashes of the structure provided positive identification." "Sincerely, Gary Hallet..." "...Special Investigator." I don't think he's in there, Sal. What would you do, Gilly? What wouldn't I do... ...for the right guy? Can love travel back in time and heal a broken heart? Come on, come on. Was it our joined hands that finally lifted Maria's curse? Here they come! I'd like to think so. Hey! There are some things, though, I know for certain: Always throw spilled salt over your left shoulder. Keep rosemary by your garden gate. Plant lavender for luck. And fall in love whenever you can. [ENGLISH - US]
