RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM ♪ ♪ One more thing before we get into your next assignments. The results for the international travel writer's awards are in. Congratulations, Caroline. Honestly, this is a team win. We all share this. Actually, it's a team third place win. Third place? Yep. It happens. Now, I know you're all waiting for your next assignments. We can't be a travel magazine without you travelling, so Greece, Sao Paulo, Bali, Nashville. You stay. I have a plum assignment for you. Carta de Amor. Carta de what? Carta de Amor. Oh, yes. The Spanish Riviera. I like that. Tapas, beaches. I can do a lot with that. Oh, I know you can, but it's not on the Spanish Riviera. Brazil. I'm gonna have to buy a new swimsuit. If you're done guessing, it's in rural New Mexico. Really? Population: 2,500. People? Usually. Is this because I took third place? No. Listen, you're a terrific writer. This is the kind of story you need right now. Human, sweet. The 100th anniversary of the Carta de Amor Christmas Parade. You've never asked me to do a Christmas story before. For good reason. You don't celebrate it. I don't have the time. I have winter travel stories to do. Stories you send me on. OK, I can take the blame for that. Look, you are a terrific travel writer. You have this ability to be able to drop in on a place and zone in on the thing that makes it special to the person reading about it. But then, when you leave, you leave it behind. Isn't that the job? You not taking your experiences on as a whole to the next place you go? It's beginning to show in your writing. Something's missing. That's where third place comes in. I don't know what to say. Say you'll go to New Mexico. I don't get back as often as I should. Oh, the other shoe drops. This sounds more like a story that you could do better than me. You get to go home and you love Christmas. I have commitments or I would, trust me. I want you to go there and spend a week on the ground. That's a long parade. I wanna push this blog as the "Twelve Posts of Christmas". You space them out how you need, just end at Christmas day with the parade. A yule blog? Exactly! See? I knew you'd get into the spirit. I want you to discover the magic of Christmas there and hold onto it. It'll be good for all of your writing. Do you trust me on this? Of course I do. [Festive music] ♪ ♪ ♪ Hey. Are you UBER? No, I'm Oscar. Are you my ride? Are there any taxis? Not since Orlando's horses retired. Is there anyone I can call to get a ride? Yeah, absolutely. It's uh, 505-555-0184. [Ringing] [Cell phone rings] Hello, can I help you? OK, very funny. I need to get to the Carta de Amor Bed and Breakfast. Could you just point me in the right direction? Well, if you're staying in town overnight that is the place to be. And I'm guessing you're Caroline. So you are here waiting for me. Yeah. My cousin Camilla asked me to pick you up and show you the town. Take you to the B&B. I'm Oscar Ortiz. Can I ask why we had to go through all that? Why couldn't you just tell me you were my ride? What fun would that be? You can put that on the floor if you want. Probably a lot more comfortable for you. That's OK. I heard it wasn't that big of a town. It's huge to a lot of people. Families are here, their lives. I meant in physical size. I know what you meant. ♪ So this street that we're on is the main parade route. That's why you're here, right? Yes sir, it is. Must be some kind of parade. Oh yeah. It's the best parade you'll ever experience. And it's the 100th anniversary this year. Hmm. The Christmas tree will be there in a couple days. That's also a pretty big deal. That might make a good blog post. Sure, I guess. I like to think it's more than that. It reminds me of the small town I grew up in. Everybody knows what everybody else is doing. You say that like it's a bad thing. I like to think it's better than it being so big that nobody cares. You might want to see a bit more of the world before you make that judgement. Does L.A. count? I was there for 10 years. L.A.? Yeah. Why would you come back here, if you don't mind me asking? My son. Stability. The fact that everyone knows what everyone else is doing. We just passed our school there. We draw from two towns nearby. How old is your son? Sean is 12. Oscar: Here we are. Carta de Amor bed and breakfast. Thank you. You're welcome. One thing. You're gonna meet mama and Mr. C. This is their place. It has been for as long as anyone can remember. Mr. C bears a striking resemblance to... you'll see. We all kind of ignore it. I've met my share of celebrities in my line of work. It'll be fine. Great. Oscar: Oh, and just so you know, everyone calls Mrs. C. "Mama". Oscar! Mama. Camilla's guest is here. Miss Williams. Welcome to Carta de Amor. You must be tired after your trip. Can I get you something to drink or eat? I would love some coffee. White chocolate mocha? We just have regular coffee here. Yeah, that works, too. Thanks. Come on in. Pretty amazing, huh? The rooms are just as nice. Here you go. Thank you. Do you mind if I take some pictures in here? Of course, dear. As many as you need. Oh, I don't have any signal. Is there no cell service here? This area of town is kinda iffy. They're gonna fix it first of the year, I think. Not very comforting. Is there any WiFi? No. No TV's, either. It's a quiet, reflective place to relax, think. To recharge. What good is recharging without a signal? She means recharge yourself. So no cell service, no Internet, no WiFi. Is there anywhere else in town that has it? I really need it to post to my blog. I think you'll find everything you need here and more. Thank you. It's just for my work. Ah, our guest has arrived. [Jolly laughing] Told you. We are so glad that you've come to be with us to celebrate Carta de Amor Christmas. Mama, we need to get those decorations up. Don't you worry, papa, we're doing that this weekend. Tree and all. Sean and I will be here to help, too. Sean has been a really good boy this year. That he has, Mr. C. I'm glad you noticed. Well, I leave you in their more than capable hands. WiFi? I really do need it. You'll be fine. There's WiFi down the street at the school. And at the diner. And at my house, actually. And you're welcome to use any of those. Thank you. That's a relief. And I will give you a WiFi tour once you're settled. Mama will give me a call. Thank you. OK. I'll see you in a bit. Can we get you some milk and cookies? You know what? I would love some. [Jolly laughing] OK. On the first post of Christmas, welcome to Carta de Amor, New Mexico. It's not the Spanish Riviera, the kind of place you're used to me posting from. I'm staying at a well-appointed adobe style home, which actually looks a bit out of place in this small town of 2,500. They tell me that Christmas is really big here. I guess we'll just have to wait and see. Now, I'm going to relax, forget where I am, sink into this bed, and dream about the sun-drenched beaches of Mallorca. Yep. Now, to find the Internet so I can actually post this. Oh, I can't believe I brought the wrong clothes. Luckily for you there is a pretty nice women's clothing store in town. Women come from all over the county to shop there. Really? Yeah, it's not another planet. Sorry. That's OK. I think I owe you an apology, too. I wasn't exactly Mr. Hospitality earlier. I'm willing to start from scratch if you are. I'll take that deal any time. Hi, dad. Hi, miss Williams. I'm Sean Ortiz. I've seen all your posts on world vista and I've even left comments. I wanna be a writer, too. Oh, you're that Sean. I've seen every issue. We all read it, and I guess when you live in a place this small it's our way of seeing the world. Well, that's the whole idea. Your dad was kind enough to let me come here and use the WiFi. You wanna hook me up? Sure. Right this way. This is a really big deal for him. He has dreams of, well, travelling and having your job, actually, one day. You OK with that? Absolutely. It's important to follow your dreams. I always tell him that. Just have a back-up plan. No worries. I get it. Thank you. ♪ And there. I connected you to the network and I also made it so that you never have to use the password ever again. Thank you, Sean. I don't know. The jury's still out. Camilla told me she's not a Christmas fan. Come on, mama, be nice. Hello, Caroline. I'm Rita Ortiz. My husband and Oscar's father, Roberto, and I are hoping you can stay for dinner. Can you? Caroline: I'd love to. Dinner was amazing. You eat like this all the time? Rita has a golden touch in the kitchen. Stop. It's just dinner. I would have moved home from L.A. for this, too. I'm sorry. I think I just stepped in something. Oscar tells us you don't have any clothes. Dad! What did I do? Josie has a really nice store in town, women come... Come from all over to shop there. Your son told me. I could help you look around. And afterwards I'd love to talk about writing. That'd be a big help. You have a wonderful family, and your son is great. Yeah, Sean. I'd be lost without him. You don't have lights up. I'm not a huge Christmas person, but... We have our traditions. It's worth the wait. But we were wondering... OK, I was wondering, why would Camilla send someone who isn't really into Christmas to cover the Christmas capital of the world? The world? Yeah, the whole world. Because she can? Good morning, sweetheart. Good morning, mama. I would love some of your coffee. I can get some coffee for you to go, and we have breakfast for you, just not here. - Isn't this a bed and breakfast? - It is. Now, let's get you dressed and down to the competition area. I am dressed. Competition? It's where we're serving breakfast. Most of the town will be there. Now, put your head down. I'll try not to mess up your hair. Uh, please tell me what's going on. You write about your experiences, right? So, do you want to experience Carta de Amor Christmas? This is the kick-off. OK. [Laughs] What is this? I can't wear this. Of course you can. Now, we've got to go or we'll be late. What?! What is going on? ♪ Hey! Oh! Mr. C. Can explain while we walk. Walk? Well, we have to let everyone see your poncho. Yeah, OK. Let me just grab my phone. [Jolly laughing] Oh, look at that! Many years ago we started the Christmas season with a traditional ugly sweater contest. Then one year Rudy Santos wore one of these and won. There were protests, naturally, but the judges ruled it legal. Well, that sounds pretty smart of Rudy. Soon everyone figured out they had to have a poncho to have a chance to win. Now it's a Christmas poncho contest. We host it every year. Oh, this is definitely my second post. I would love some pancakes, please. [Festive upbeat music] ♪ ♪ Ha, ha! Wow. It is pretty hideous. But yours isn't too bad, either. Yeah, thanks. It's the same as last year's. But, unlike you, I'm not trying to win. Oh, here, sit down. I can't stay. I'm on clean up. Oh. Thank you. Enjoy your meal. Good morning. Are you enjoying your stay at the B&B? I sure slept well. Those beds are really nice. Mr. C., it seems so strange that... You know, Oscar is the music teacher for the district. Bands, choirs, singing groups. Music? I had no idea. What does he play? Oh, if it has strings on it, he can play it. He was a big deal in L.A. Wow. These are the best pancakes I've ever tasted. It's Sam, he's amazing. You'll meet him. You were asking about Oscar. Oh, yes. Music, that's what he was doing in L.A.? He was a successful studio musician. Albums, soundtracks. You're kidding. Why would he leave all that to come back here? I'm sorry, that came out wrong. An honest question. You should ask him. [Upbeat music] ♪ ♪ Hi, everyone. For those who don't know me, I am Betty Johnson, the school district librarian. [Applause] - Good morning. - Good morning. If you want to know anything about Carta de Amor history Betty is the be all and end all. Every detail. Good to know. [Drops mic] Oh... Thank you, Sam. Do you see where that button is...? Yeah. That's Sam. He made your breakfast. A master chef and without the formal training. Is the restaurant in town his? The diner? Oh, no. He's the school cafeteria cook. What?! It's time to announce the finalists for the poncho contest. [Applause] But before we do, our favourite music teacher, Oscar Ortiz, has something he wants to say. Thank you, Betty. Hi, everyone, and Merry Christmas. I just wanted to thank you all for your generous donations to the band uniform fund. But I also know that at this time of the year your money needs to be spent on your families. I don't want any of this to be a hardship. So that's why I've decided to suspend the money drive until after the holidays. [Applause] That's pretty sweet. He's always thinking about everybody but himself. And now our finalists: Eddie Gonzales and Jackie Martin! [Applause] And last, in a surprise choice, but I saw this woman's poncho in the food line and it is truly horrible, and the first outsider ever to make the final three, Caroline Williams! Crowd: Who? Who? Oh, no. Caroline is in town to do a story for Camilla Talamantes's travel magazine. I know a lot of you were disheartened by her first post but give her a chance. You've been summoned. You can't keep your public waiting. And the winner of $100, courtesy of Carta de Amor hardware, is, in an upset... Caroline Williams! [Jolly laughing] I'm just as shocked as you all are, and I thank you. But I think I would like to donate my prize to the band uniform fund. [Applause] Thanks. Thank you, thank you... Mighty good job. Thank you, Betty. You're welcome. Congratulations. Thank you. Have a good evening. You too. Thank you. I appreciate every dollar. Well, it seemed like the perfect thing to do. And I didn't just do it because everybody didn't like my first post. Well, you know, your first post did leave a lot to be desired. You talked about other places you'd rather be. You read it? Oh yeah, I read it. So did Sean. He was... he was a little bit disappointed, to be honest. That wasn't my purpose. I'll talk to Sean. No, it's OK. He knows that actions speak louder than words. But what you might wanna do is try and get what we're doing here. I mean, it's our Christmas traditions that... that bring us together and make us kinda unique, I think. So who were the judges, anyway? Uh, mama and Mr. C. They cheated. Hey, never judge the C’s. It's a big rule around here. OK, I have to ask you about them. [Jolly laughter] Congratulations on your win! Just let it go. They rarely get things wrong. Thank you. [Jolly laughing] So I'm gonna go grab Sean but we'll be back later to decorate the B&B. You wanna help? I know, Christmas isn't really your thing, but there might be another post. Get you out of here sooner. You're looking out for me, huh? Yeah. It'd be nice if you opened your mind a little and tried to enjoy Carta de Amor for what it is instead of what it isn't. On the second post of Christmas Carta de Amor gave me a new tradition to experience. The ugly Christmas poncho. They've taken the ugly sweater and re-spun it. The whole town turns out in their custom ugly Christmas ponchos to crown that year's Victor. And, being a journalist who always tries to live what I'm reporting, I donned a borrowed ugly poncho and actually won this year's crown. Here's me, mortified. Thanks for meeting me on such short notice. My pleasure. So what do you wanna know? History. What makes Carta de Amor tick? Can we start with the parade? That seems to be the biggest deal. Nobody actually knows how it started. Really? Does it matter? This is a community who's definition of ourselves is in our Christmas celebration. It's like we get a rebirth every year. Wow. I guess I... Wrote a couple of blog posts before understanding that? Yeah. I did. But I'm going to try to be more receptive. I hope I haven't worn out my welcome. Christmas is all about new starts. You'll find everyone here pretty forgiving. One more question. Where is the clothing store? I have nothing to wear. Josie's. Come on, I'll take you. That was fun. It was a blast. I can't believe her selection for such a small... Small town in the middle of nowhere? Sorry. Don't be. You stopped yourself. That's an improvement. It is. And I genuinely enjoyed your company. And the history lesson. That's what new friends do together. That they do. OK, let it go. Caroline, you're just in time. Ah, and you got some new clothes, too. Very nice. Thank you. And since you're all here, um, I wanted to apologize for not being all in with Carta de Amor. I would like another chance. From you, too, Sean. Do you wanna help us decorate the tree? I haven't um... I haven't decorated a tree since I was a kid. Don't you miss it? You know, the smell of that tree does bring back memories. I love that smell. Well, then decorate it. Fulfill this plain tree's destiny. Come on. Wow, OK. Um... No. Maybe. Yeah. That felt good. You know what? Let's... let's do some more. ♪ There is no other day like Christmas ♪ ♪ ...for every little girl and boy... ♪ Way up. ♪ All the toys in the store, decorations galore, ♪ ♪ and stockings hung by the fire, ♪ ♪ there's no other day like Christmas, ♪ ♪ it's the day we dream about all year, ♪ ♪ lights hung down the street, ♪ ♪ as far as the eye can see ♪ ♪ are even better than the year before... ♪ ♪ Ah. Well, you got in the spirit. That wasn't hard at all, was it? I honestly enjoyed it. It's been a long time. We're going to the big tree tomorrow night. You could write about that. Big tree? Yeah. Everyone who's there hangs an ornament on it. Something meaningful. We'll have to get you an ornament. There's a shop in town... Sean. No, he's right. My job is to participate in what I'm covering. So if everyone's hanging an ornament then I will, too. How about ornament shopping with me? Really? Yeah, OK! Great. Mama: Caroline? Would you like some more hot chocolate? Last call. Yes, please. Excuse me. Can you uh, play mom's song? I'd really like to hear it. Sure, buddy. I'll go get your guitar. On the third post of Christmas, Carta de Amor reminded me of the fun I had as a child decorating a tree, going all out to let anyone coming in know there is no mistaking the holidays are here. Carta de Amor does have its appeal. [Singing o, Christmas tree in Spanish] ♪♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [Clapping] That was wonderful. They said you were good but... Wow. Thanks. It's a special song. I could tell. Do you wanna have lunch tomorrow? Both of you? Sorry, we're making a float for a parade, but thank you. Well, I would love to. But not at the diner. There's somewhere else? Yep. I might need a ride. I could call a taxi but I heard the horse retired. [Laughs] I think I could find you a ride. How's noon? That's great. Thank you both for a great night. It was fun. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna take a walk and see if I can find a signal to post to my blog. OK. No place safer than Carta de Amor. See you tomorrow. Noon. OK, I think I officially like her. Mmmhmm. Alright, your turn. [Instrumental plays] ♪♪ ♪ Caroline: I really had a great time decorating last night. Oscar: I watched you. I could tell. You need to pick something up from the school? Well, I promised you a great lunch. Here? Yeah. [Laughs] OK. Yeah, I hope you're hungry. I'm always hungry. What's this? Well, a much better lunch than at the diner. Hi. Thank you. Today's menu is a small shrimp salad, then my special chicken de amor, followed by dessert. Wow. That sounds lovely. Oh, you have no idea. So, what do you think? I'm stunned. You did make a lot of yummy noises. - Did I? - Yeah. Wow. What did you do to this chicken? I'll be back with the dessert. Thank you. You didn't have to do this much. I wanted to. Your last post was different. It was better. Well, I wanna thank you for being so honest with me. Honesty is important. I appreciate you being so open to it. Soloing and stuff, I just like to play the bass. Oh. Like, the rhythm. No, you should though. Last course. This is so pretty I'm afraid to eat it. What's it called? Platino Frito. It's a traditional Christmas dessert around here. OK. Can I take you home with me? [Laughing] Enjoy! Wow. I told you. I mean, he's the best. And this is the best. [All laughing] Wow. Sure, I'd love to have my own restaurant. But it's all timing. Baloney. It's all about Betty. Betty? Librarian Betty? My friend, Betty? Your friend, Betty? Yes, we have bonded. OK, well, Sam and Betty have been friends for years and Betty has no idea that Sam wants more. Oh, you gotta tell her. I can't risk it. What if she doesn't feel the same way? Then I don't even have her as a friend. See, this is the same answer he gives every time I ask. Come on. She's really smart and really funny. She's not gonna be available forever. Heck, just cook for her like this! That would work on me. Yeah, but are you sure she would like the school gym? Oh, I don't know. The beautiful table, the exclusivity. The food. Company. It's the holidays. Hmm. You keep talking about Christmas like it's something special. It's growing on me. About time. Caroline: On the fourth post of Christmas a surprise holiday meal came to me. It wasn't four calling birds but a magical chicken dish in a place you wouldn't expect it. A stealth master chef in a cafeteria cook disguise made me a yuletide lunch of epic proportions. I'm so sorry you all couldn't have a bite of it, but that's OK. I wouldn't have shared it. Oh, hey, uh... I'm singing and playing Christmas songs tomorrow night at the lakeside inn. Do you wanna come? Another chance to hear you play. I'm in. Great. Tonight, before we light the tree, everyone who comes hangs their ornament on it. Something meaningful. I'm waiting for you to tell me the wishes come true. Some do. But some don't. I can tell you that from experience. Maybe your wish will come true this year. So, letting the town decorate the tree? I never heard of that before. It's nice. Yeah. So I'll see you around 8:00? You're leaving? I'm giving you some time with Sean. Just remember, pick your ornament carefully. - Something that represents... - My Christmas wish. Yeah. Hi! Sorry I'm late. Oh, hi. I knew you'd be here. Dad told you about the wishes? In great detail. You've gotta do it. I do. And you know, honestly, when I first got here I just wanted to report and go. But I think there's something special about this place. Besides Christmas? Including Christmas. Alright, let's pick an ornament. You'll have to do that by yourself. I'll be in the store, but afterwards I would love to talk about writing. Deal. Ah, Christmas. Caroline: On the fifth post of Christmas I bought my first Christmas ornament in years with my new friend, Sean, in anticipation of the tree lighting tonight in the town square here in Carta de Amor. Okay. Christmas or the world? Caroline: Christmas is everywhere and believe it or not I think I can actually physically feel it. It completely washes over you and I'm beginning to understand Carta de Amor's universal Christmas spirit. [Snaps photo] Did you find one? I did. I'm gonna go pay for this and then let's go get some ice cream and talk. Will do. [Phone ringing] Caroline Williams. Caroline. Valerie Warshaw, global destinations magazine. Oh, wow. Ms. Warshaw, yes. Oh, you can just call me Valerie. I was calling to let you know how much we're enjoying your Christmas blog here. You mean my yule blog? That's genius. I hope you use it. I plan to. You know, this Carta de Amor assignment has turned out to be very interesting. Hmm. Well, my friends are out shopping for Christmas ponchos. You did that. Keep up the good work. And I'll let you know about the job soon. It looks quite promising. It's my dream job. It's every travel reporter's dream job. Any-who, happy holidays if you don't hear from me before that. OK, thank you. Did that really just happen? So, what'd you choose this year, Sean? I'm gonna start as shortstop. Hey, that is a good wish. I notice you don't have an ornament, Mr. C. [Laughing] What'd I say? All the ornaments are my Christmas wishes. Anybody wanna tell me what that means? Mine is the same as the last eight years. That's a good wish. Yeah. Mine is the same as Oscar's because we both wish for the same thing. Peace for him. Peace for Oscar? Eight years since Judy passed. Oh. Sean's mother. That's why Oscar came home from L.A. Your turn. What's your Christmas wish? The world? It's job related. I know it seems small compared to your wishes. No. Christmas wishes can be anything you want. Go hang it. Caroline: On the sixth post of Christmas for this yule blog I joined the people of Carta de Amor in hanging their Christmas wishes on the community tree. I know you all expect me to join in when I'm telling you about some place, but this time, whether I was reporting it or not, I'd hang my wish on this tree. It's a night of hope and community here in Carta de Amor, with no one left unaffected by it. Including me. ♪ [Applause] Beautiful. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Can I go to my friend's house? Yeah, of course. If you need a ride home you just let me know, OK? I'll come get you. Thanks. Boy, that brings back memories. The safety of a small town. It's rare these days. Oh yeah. When I was in L.A. I was always on guard. Do you miss it? Yeah, I do sometimes. Then I look at Sean and I don't anymore. Do you miss your small town? I didn't. But then I look around at all this and I kinda do. I guess we have something in common after all. Oh, hey, I've got a signal. I should probably go. Yeah. Work. It can wait. It's a beautiful night. Do you want to walk me back to the B&B? It would be my pleasure. Hey, I'm so sorry about your wife. Nobody said life was fair. You either curl up or you cope. If I hadn't had Sean to think about I might have curled up. You're a good dad. Thanks. I try. It's harder at Christmas. Hmm. To be honest, you're making it easier this year. I'm not sure what I've done. You've exceeded my expectations. Camilla said you needed some help with Christmas spirit but after a rough start... [Laughs] You seem to be doing fine on your own. Your posts show it, too. Well, if my posts show it, it's because of you. Your family. I think it's in Carta de Amor's DNA, honestly. Yeah. And I might have missed Christmas a little. Oh. Well. I'm glad you're still reading my posts. Everybody in town is. You're a celebrity now. Not in the dog house anymore? No. [Jolly laughing] OK, I really need to ask you about him... Hey, do you wanna come over tomorrow? There's a couple more Christmas traditions I'd like to share. Might be good for your blog. But mostly because I would like it. I'd love to. Just uh, just say when and I'll be there. Great. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Dad's out planning with the parade committee. So, are you ready to cook? Oh, Christmas cookies? You should know my mother and I were champs at it. How are you at tamales? Tamales? Christmas tamales. Yeah. People come from far and wide for my mom's tamales at Christmas time. I thought you might wanna watch. Just watch? [Scoffs] No way. Oh, really? Wanna help? Start shucking. Like this. This corn's pickled and ready to grind. Are you making masa from scratch? You know tamales? I did a story last month in Costa Rica, but are you gonna grind the corn yourself? Nana said we're gonna do it just like the Aztecs did, with rocks. OK, I'm in. Where are the rocks? This is my rock, but I have to admit I'm impressed you were up for it. I was joking. What do you say about letting Caroline and me finish these up? I'm game if he is. We could take a look at my Christmas list. You sure? OK. Christmas list it is. This smells amazing. I uh, I never get tired of that smell. It takes me back to my grandmother's kitchen. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm! Now I gotta get another spoon. What? Who needs a spoon? [Laughing] Oh, OK! It's on! It's on!! [Laughing] Uh-oh. My-my mom is gonna be mad. Just tell her it's my fault. I think she's still mad at me about that first blog post. No. Sometimes it's hard to combat preconceived notions but she'll come around. I did. Oh, you did, huh? I have. Completely. I always thought you were trouble. Oh yeah? - Mmmhmm. - Hmm. At first. But today I know for a fact. [Laughs] [Gasps] Sean. What're you doing? I think I should be the one asking that question. It's not what you think. I think it was. Rita: Doesn't sound like cooking to me. OK, out. Go clean up, both of you. I can't believe you did this to my kitchen. It's my kitchen. I'll clean up. We'll clean up. I don't trust either one of you. Out. I need to salvage these tamales. Your father is counting on them. Me too. Yeah, so am I. [Snaps fingers] [Oscar laughs] OK, OK. Dios mio. Rita: Go ahead, eat sweetheart. Mmm. I could write an entire article on these alone. You should be making these all year. Oh, no. They only taste like this at Christmas. And it's only Christmas when we get them. And it's Christmas. And I'm hungry. Hey, that-that is mine. Mmm-mm. Whoa. I haven't had that much fun in a long time. Me neither. But... You want to slow it down. For Sean, I get it. No. No, actually Sean seems fine. It's my own conflicted feelings I think. I haven't felt these emotions in a long time. I'm not going anywhere. At least not for a few days. There's also that to think about. You think about that then. I'll be thinking about you. I'll see you tonight. I can't wait to hear you sing again. ♪ Thank you, Sean. On the seventh post of Christmas Carta de Amor is gonna make the Christmas cookie obsolete. Introducing the Christmas tamale. It's a family tradition here and one that I got to participate in. I wish that blog posts came with scratch and sniff because it smelled so good. Only when the ingredients are well mixed can the tamales come out perfectly. Well, near perfection. Oh, and uh... yum. [Phone rings] Hello? It's Betty. In your blog did you mean "yum" for the tamales or for him? Both. [Deck the halls plays on piano] ♪♪ ♪ Hey. I'm so glad to see you here. You too. You're looking smoking hot. I might be a tad overdressed. If anyone thinks that, they're just jealous. I'm jealous. [Laughing] [Begins playing] ♪ He looks happy. This is new? This is new. This is you. [Applause] What a night, huh? Wow, as I look around at all my friends, old and new, I think we are the luckiest people in the world to be right here, right now. There's nothing like a carta de amor Christmas. And there's no song like this one to close out the night. [Begins to play] ♪ ♪ Silent night, ♪ ♪ holy night, ♪ ♪ Shepherds quake at the sight, ♪ ♪ glories stream from heaven afar, ♪ ♪ heavenly hosts sing hallelujah, ♪ ♪ Christ the saviour is born, ♪ ♪ Christ the saviour is born, ♪ ♪ Christ the saviour is born ♪ [Applause] Thanks guys. I think I'm just going to stick around for a minute. Yeah, that sounds great. It's wonderful. I was waiting for you to play your song. What song? The song that you sang to Sean. Yeah, that-that's Judy's song. I don't really play it in public anymore. Oh, I didn't know. I just like it. Yeah, I... I love it, too. But it's reserved. OK. Yeah, I get it. Do you wanna grab a coffee or something? May-uh, maybe not tonight. I'm tired, you know. Yeah, OK. See you later. [Exhales] [Exhales] Oscar: Caroline. Does that offer for coffee still stand? Of course. Thanks. You found me a white chocolate mocha? Yeah, I pay attention. Thank you for both. The coffee and for paying attention. Sorry for back at the inn. That was so rude. I get it. It's that song. This time of the year. The guilt. You. I like being with you, too. How'd you know that's what I meant? I'm a writer. I understand subtext. Wherever it goes... I'm happy right now. Me too. ♪ [Jolly laughter] To Christmas and the joy that it brings. May this Christmas bring you peace and love. I like that. So no coal for any of us this year? [Jolly laugh] No coal. No coal, indeed. Merry Christmas. I want you to help me put out Christmas lights tomorrow at my house. Sam usually helps me. Speaking of Sam, don't you think that Christmas is the perfect time for him to finally tell Betty how he feels? You should tell him. Well, you know, sometimes it's hard to tell someone... Special how you really feel. Uh, so you wanna help me with the lights? I can't think of anything I'd rather do. This is going to be such a Merry Christmas. It already is. [Clink] On the eighth post of Christmas this city of Carta de Amor gets more serious about their Christmas celebrations, if that's possible. Getting ready for a big parade that I cannot wait to see, I helped my friend Sean decorate their float. Christmas is in full swing here in Carta de Amor. Hey. Hi. Do you want me to grab the ladder? I used to do that for my dad when we'd put up lights. That's very sweet but we don't need the ladder. How are we gonna put the lights up, then? They don't go up. They go down. On the ground. What kind of Christmas lights go down on the ground? The most meaningful kind. Wait here. I'm completely mystified. In the late 1800's at Christmastime the locals marked the paths of their houses with small, controlled bonfires to light the way for the holy family. The invention of the paper bag changed everything. Pass me a candle, please. We do this to honour the tradition, and it also saves us from having to buy wood for the fires. It's probably safer, too. And there's that. We call them farolitos. Some people call them luminarias. I like farolitos. Do you wanna help me light the path? Are you kidding? I'd love to. [Spanish Christmas Carol] ♪♪ ♪ [Laughing] ♪ [Laughter] ♪ There aren't words. Oscar: I never get tired of it. In fact, I missed it when I was in L.A. Greendale was Christmas light central. Not like this. But I didn't realize I missed it until tonight. No one is getting lost tonight, either. Or until Christmas. Can we walk and see them all? Of course. I'm gonna grab a jacket. Do you need anything? No, thanks. I'm gonna post to the blog first. This is so amazing I don't wanna be thinking about work while we look at them. OK. I'll be right back. On the ninth post of Christmas I was part of something wonderful and amazing. These are farolitos. Luminarias. A Christmas light significant to those here in Carta de Amor. I got to make them, light them, place them. It was... magic. I may have lost my way to the holidays over the years but these lights will never let me lose my way to Christmas ever again. Oscar: Christmas in Carta de Amor. Caroline: You know, when I left Greendale I really did leave Christmas behind. Oscar: Yeah? Caroline: It took coming back to another small town to find it again, I think. Oscar: You think? Caroline: I know. Hmm. Hey, you wanna go check on our Christmas wishes? Everyone goes back to the tree over the holidays to check their wish. You have a lot of Christmas traditions here to keep track of. [Laughs] Yeah, I never really thought of it before but I guess you're right. ♪ Are you taking your wish off the tree? No, never. It's just... every year I put my wish for a restaurant on the tree. And this year... Sam? Is that Betty? Catch you later. No, you're not going anywhere, buster. - Hi. - Hi. I guess I wasn't the only one with this idea. I guess not. Which one is yours? OK, time for a Christmas miracle. This one is Sam's and it's you. I'm crazy about you. I was afraid if you didn't feel the same way I'd lose you as a friend. Me too. [Laughing] Christmas wishes coming true. You made mine come true, too. How? I've been looking for some peace in my life and I have not felt this much in years. Thank you. It's been a long time since I felt this comfortable with anyone or any place, too. It's all so special. Yeah. Spend Christmas Eve with me. With my family. I'd be honoured. Betty and Sam found each other in the light of the community Christmas tree. Christmas wishes coming true. I wish you were all here to share it with me. You really should come. It can't be described in words. OMG I think I might have writer's block. It's Christmas Eve tomorrow and for the first time in years and years I'm actually excited by the idea. And if it's even a fraction of what I've experienced so far it will be beyond wonderful. Good morning. I can't believe I slept so late. I guess I missed breakfast, huh? I'm sure I can find you something. You've been so nice. Both of you. I'm actually going dress shopping for tonight with Betty. I'm spending it at Oscar's. What do you do on Christmas Eve? I'll be at Oscar's with you. I'm so glad you're both coming. Just me. Everyone knows Mr. C. has a standing engagement on Christmas Eve. Of course he does. Of course he does. Probably a small trip around the world with some reindeer. [Phone ringing] Yes, Betty, I am still very excited about tonight. Caroline? Oh, uh, Ms. Warshaw. I mean, Valerie. I- I wasn't expecting... I thought I'd give you an early gift. The dream job's yours. We'll spend the first week going over your package and then it's off to London for your coming out at the London expo. Of course, that's after new year's. Wow. I'm stunned. Um... I... I thought you'd be out for the holidays. I just... I wasn't expecting to hear from you so soon. Oh, dear. I'm much too busy to worry about Christmas. And you will be, too, soon. Are you there? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course. Um, I'm just... So I'll see you in New York. Tomorrow. On Christmas? Of course, yes. On the 26th then. Bright and early. See you then. It's just-I’m-I'm in New Mexico so I... Hello? Valerie? ♪ You OK? Yeah. I'm just thinking about some work stuff. Don't think about work tonight. It's Christmas Eve. Besides, we still have my favourite tradition to go. The parade, that's mine. [Laughing] Mine is the Christmas wishes on the tree. Well, you do have a lot of traditions here to choose from. Have you figured out which is your favourite one yet? Let her experience them all, mama. And tonight's mine. OK. I give. What happens tonight? Well, we... we remember and honour loved ones who aren't here to share this with us. Caroline: Really? Yeah. And that way we're still sharing Christmas with them. That's beautiful. I like this one. I'd like to talk about mom. I- I do miss mom a little bit, but that's OK 'cause I know she's here with us on Christmas and that's all that matters to me. Sam: I'd like to go next. Best memories of Tommy Rowland, a quality man. We spent the best Christmases of our lives together and he also did one thing for me that I'll always be grateful for. When he was principal he hired Betty to be librarian. I wish he was here to see us together. Me too. That was great, Sam. So, who's next?

Orlando took his horses out of retirement for me. That's a real thing? Yeah. You've assimilated well. Just doing my job. No, that's not true. I'm here because I wanna be here. And I wanna say something to all of you. I would like to say... Merry Christmas! [Laughter] Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, sweetheart. Thank you. Caroline, your posts from here have been incredible for us. That thing that makes your writing special? It's back. Thank you. There's a bonus coming. Thank you, Camilla, but I really need to talk to you in private. Oh, if it's about business it can wait until after Christmas. I don't do business at Christmas. And neither should you. Now, I'm tired. I'll see you at the parade? Goodnight, Camilla. Thank you. For what? You said "Merry Christmas". I haven't heard you say that before. [Laughs] I have, too. Haven't I? No. Look, I know it's been a whirlwind, but before school starts and I have to go back to work, let's go to Santa Fe for new year's. It's really special there. Um... Or... you know, forget that for now. Do you wanna ride in my truck tomorrow in the parade? Hey. Hey, what's the matter? Uh... my wish on the tree, it came true. The world? I got the job I've always wanted and I have to be in New York on the 26th. That means you have to leave... - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow. Yeah, well... What was I thinking? Of course you have to leave. You have a career. I'm really happy for you. I'm sorry. No. No, don't be. I'm telling you the same thing I tell Sean. You have to follow your dreams. Always do what's in your heart. Do you want a ride to the train... I am really torn here and you need to know that. Yeah. I've waited my whole life for this job and... you... Well, it's... I'll be back. We both know that you won't. I really appreciate everything you've done for the town and for me. You got me breathing again. Tell Sean... Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell him. Well, it's late. And it's Christmas. [Laughs] Merry Christmas, Caroline. Merry Christmas, Oscar. Need a ride? I was gonna walk. Let me give you a ride. I'll get my keys. You spent all Christmas day in your room. That's not good. I'm not in a celebrating mood. I figured. Why we left you alone. People all out for the parade. I hope it's a good one. It's never a good one. They last maybe 15 minutes. Some old trucks all decorated with crepe paper as floats. Some of the kids from Oscar's marching band. Some dogs dressed up in their Christmas finest. What? But I thought... You thought it's like the ones in San Francisco? No. It's small, but it's ours. Genuinely ours. That's what makes it so special. But if that's all that it is why did Camilla send me here? She knew that you needed to be here. To soak in our Christmas. You're not leaving Christmas behind this time, are you? You're taking it with you? Absolutely, I'm taking it with me. OK, I have to ask you. Are you Santa Claus? [Jolly laughter] No. Of course not. What made you think that? Are you kidding? Everything! You were gone last night and, according to everyone, every Christmas Eve. [Jolly laugh] I serve food at the food kitchen in Dorry every Christmas Eve. I do play Santa for the kids. [Jolly laugh] Wow. Here we are. Thank you for the ride. Thank you for being here. For your talent. For honouring our town with your words. For opening yourself up to what Christmas can be if you let it. I know what Christmas can be now. Even the magic? Especially the magic. Good. One more thing. Merry Christmas. Oh, I can't. Thank you. Thank you. [Train bell chiming] Not Santa, huh? Caroline: On the 11th post of Christmas I wait to leave Carta de Amor. If there was ever a town that lived up to its name it's this one. Love letter. A love letter to its wonderful townsfolk. Its traditions. A huge love letter to Christmas. A town that embraces you from the minute you arrive and means it. I have taken you with me to a lot of places in the past but this is the one I'm taking with me. It's Caroline Williams! That is awful. Congratulations. What's going on here? Oh, well we're here for the parade that you asked us to come to see. I did? You said on your blog you wish we could all experience it for ourselves so we're here. I was gonna spend another Christmas alone until you invited me. You didn't all come together? All: No. You'd better get going or you're gonna miss the parade.

Real people showing true love for the season and letting everyone know. Anyone can march, anyone can watch. Oh, and Christmas wishes really do come true. I got my real dream job. Camilla and I made a new deal. I can work from Carta de Amor and travel when I need to. It's a great train ride. But you can be sure I'll be taking Christmas and Carta de Amor everywhere I go.
