Yes, it's the time when the communist attack is becoming severe every day. Our people should unite even more and fight with the communist force till the end, where they try to destroy world peace and spread their system to trample on humanity. And with the Korean War, our country is trying even more to enforce our army. It's an honor of our town to send away these two young men. We have a precious gift for them. These are flags that we've made ourselves. Thank you. There's nothing more we can ask for if our sincere heart in this flag can protect your health. Thank you. Oh, mother. This is Eun-ju who will take care of you while I'm away. Mother, you must be happy. Indeed I am. So grateful for everybody's support. Try to quit drinking and don't get into a fight when you go to Nonsan. I'm going there to learn how to fight though. I should fight. A war is to save a country but fighting can ruin the society. Okay. Then let's give three cheers for the two men. Wait a moment. For a holy day like today, let us start off. Go ahead. Everyone, please cheer for the two men. - Dry bones. - Fatty. Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Is this broken? No need to weigh again. Can't be too light as a dry-bones and can't be too heavy as a fatty. Even one's fingers are all different. How many people in the world have the same height and weight? We're just following the policy. We can't accept you two. Oh come on. Get out of the way! Oh my, if we met in Myeongdong, we would have gone for a drink. Are you making fun of me now? What're you going to do now that you stand up? What is this? What's all the fuss? These guys are not following my orders. Hey, watch your words. Who are you guys? Hello. I'll tell you in detail. I'm fat and my friend here is skinny. And they say I'm overweight and he is underweight. Yes, that's right. Try once again. Yes. And you now. Yes. The scale is broken, right? It's not about the scale but you don't have weight. So what I wanted to say was your spirit should be more important than your weight. Wouldn't a strong spirit be enough to beat up our enemy? And even if you're overweight... ...to stop the bullets coming from the enemy... ...you would need a body strong as a steel, okay? Okay, go there and wait. - Okay. - Okay. How much do we have to wait? Next is Dry-bones and Fatty. - Yes. - Did we pass? Hey, this way. You're here. First grade pass for Dry-bones. Same for Fatty! Who said you've passed as first grade? What? Then what? You've failed. Hey bro, oh no, general. For what we see, we have no issues for fighting. What do you mean fight? This is not the first-line troop. I know. This is the Honam line. This is not the place for jokes. Actually, we're not trying to join the army to make jokes. You should understand we've risked our lives to get in. If we fail at the physical exam, that would be a life failure. A looser. Please don't let the fire of patriotism go off. Where else can lousy men who can't even join the army be used? Pleading like that won't work in the army. Then did we fail for good? I guess our life is doomed. But looking at your spirits. You two have passed as third grade but not first grade. Then we're in? Oh, bro! - This is great! - Wow, this is great! Thank you, thank you. Thank you. We used to be hot in Myeongdong. I know we're at Nonsan... ...but these unfitting clothes are nonsense. Damn it, I can't even breathe. You're really out of style. Hey. Hey, let's go and talk to the company commander. If not him, then let's go to major general. If not the major general... ...maybe the chief of staff or even the secretary of defense. - Yes, let's say what we have to say. - Yes. I can do that. Hello. 15th Training Company. Salute! Trainee Dry-bones have a business to take care of. Same here for trainee Fatty. What's wrong with your clothes? We're actually here to ask you about the clothes. These are not training clothes. They're not-for-training clothes. Do you guys know where you are? It's the military. Of course we know. Why don't you act like a soldier if you know? We do want to act like one but this doesn't let our body move. First, this is suffocating. Are you guys fools not to know that you're wearing each other's clothes? What? Oh, that's right. - No wonder this is so big. - No wonder this is so small. You guys get it now? Yes sir, we've realized that you are right. Dry-bones and Fatty are done with our business. Salute! What did I say? Didn't I say that was mine? What? It's my fault? You're the one who gave this to me. Take it off. Let's switch. Here? Stop talking and take it off. Okay. What are you guys doing there? We're changing our clothes. Just as it seems. We'll get going. Oh my. Excuse us. For 8 weeks from now on. For 48 days if you count the days. For 1,152 hours if you count the hours, I'm the first sergeant to share your pleasures and pains. Ask me if there's something you want to know. And let me know if there's anything bothers you. Okay? Yes! And... Come on. Hurry. Hurry! Who are you guys? It's him and me as you see. What? Is that how you answer in the military? Yes, I'm Dry-bones. And I'm Fatty. Go to your seats. - Yes. - Yes. Can you move your leg? It's because you're fat. Go around there. What are you doing? Go to your seats and sit down. Fatty tripped on the leg since he's fat. I'm sorry. Sit down now. Be quiet. And one more thing. How come his father is so same as Fatty? If he doesn't have a beard, I can't distinguish between the two. Oh, this seems to be Dry-bone's young days. Yes, it is. Let me tell you. Dry-bones' family was very rich. But they were bankrupt after the Korean War. And then he became alone without parents or siblings. So was he close with Fatty from when he was young? Not just close but they were like brothers. It's already the time. I know. I heard they learn drinking when they join the army. I guess it's going to be tough for them. I'm worried about Fatty for his fat body. Mother, I'll go for the broadcasting. Oh, mother. Tonight's show is about the army so the trainees should listen too. Do you think they're going to stay up to listen? It's at eight thirty so I guess they'll be up. - Bye. - Bye. I thought many times but it seems like Dry-bones and Fatty can't do regular training. So just have them finish the basic trainings... ...and let them do things like making meals. Okay. And if you find positive things about them, they can work on that too. Yes, sir. Salute. Attention. How does your military uniform feel? It's great. I know. Everyone feels confident when they first wear the military uniform. Oh, sergeant. What? If you have some time tonight, how about drink some beer with us? I don't know if I would have time. I'll wait at the PX tonight. We can meet there. I'll meet you there if I have time. I'll follow your lead so please take good care of me. I'll take good care of everyone. But maybe treat me specially. Hope to see you tonight. Okay. Okay, we're going to meet tonight. Hey, come lie down. - This feels great. - Really? It's better than a decent hotel in Myeongdong. This big boy is making trouble even in the training station. What trouble? Me? This bed is making the trouble. Should I help you fix it? You know how to fix? Yes, I was a carpenter. What? Oh really? Then come and fix this. Hey keep it quiet. This is not a carpenter's shop. Is it wrong fixing the broken bed? Is it wrong to ask you to be more quiet? I'm sorry. Hey, can't you not make any noise to fix that? How can I make no noise? Then go out and fix it. Hey, you have a problem with that? Damn you. - Hey. - I'm almost done. Whatever. You think this place is yours? What did you say? Why're you staring at me like that? What's making you so upset? You're not going to scare away anyone with that. Stop it. We're one family in this barrack. We don't have to fight for such a minor issue. Hey, you trying to teach someone here? Oh, sorry. It's all our fault. Forgive us, it's my fault. Be careful next time, okay? It's because I'm fat. Stop it. - Let's go, Dry-bones. - Let me go! Come on. At ease. We're going to start the real training from tomorrow. I'll give some free time today. Do whatever you want to do. And another thing. You guys are free to use the PX and the activity center. Hey, let's go for a drink. You said, you'll be meeting sergeant Ku here, right? He said for sure he'll come. The beer here tastes great. Hey! Give us 2 more bottles here. Okay. This reminds me of Myeongdong. Beer is always good but it's sad that we don't have our lovers around. But you have me and I have you. - It's the same thing. - That's right. Okay then. For our health. - Bravo. - Okay, bravo. Why don't you give me a drink? Hey, I'm just saying. We're paying anyways so why not make it more enjoyable? Please let the woman there come over here. Well, that would be against the rule. Hey, you'll not like it if you treat us like that. I'm sorry. Then she doesn't have to pour our drinks but let her bring 2 more bottles. Okay. Hurry up. 8:30. It's time for the military broadcasting. Today, we have Kim Eun-ju and Lee Ok-hwa as a special guest. They'll be singing a song for the trainees who went to Nonsan. For the music, we have Park Chun-seok and his band. Under the beautiful moonlight. Holding hands with you. Looking at the dreaming sky above. A romantic night whispering love. Love is beautiful. Like a flower blooming in the dreams. Let's sing a sweet love song I'll just give you so take it. No, I'll leave it here and come back often after training. It's always great to hear her voice. Where is the voice coming from? It's from her neck, where else? No, I think it's coming from her star-like eyes. Are you saying she has a mouth in her eyes? Shhh! Hey, this is boring. Change the channel. Hey, turn on some exciting music, gosh. Under the beautiful moonlight. Holding hands with you. Looking at the dreaming sky above. A romantic night whispering love. Love is beautiful. Like a flower blooming in the dreams. Let's sing a sweet love song. This night where moonlights go to sleep... ...Kim Eun-ju and Lee Ok-hwa's song is over... - ...and now we'll bring you a march music. - This is nice. Oh god, let me continue to have this feeling forever! Who is it? Hey. What's wrong with this bed? - Hey, Fatty. - Why? What's up? Why do we have this marching music in our room? What? From when did our room change like this? Hey, that trumpet... Hey. Hey, do you know where you're at? Isn't this our room? Wake up, you bastards. Don't swear on us. Would you join us for a drink? We don't have anything to eat, but have some drink. Let's have a drink. Get out! Oh come on, just a drink. I'm sorry. That was not good. The buildings look all same without numbers. How can we tell it's our barracks? Hey, I have an idea. What? Why don't we write our names down on our barracks tomorrow? Great, let's write it big. But anyways. What? Listening to Eun-ju's nightingale voice... I don't think I can sleep tonight. Stop that nonsense and drink up what we have left. Okay. Oh, Eun-ju. This isn't Eun-ju, it's beer. One man's fault is everyone's fault. You should always remember that, okay? Yes! Dry-bones and Fatty, come out. I'm sorry for everything. I don't have anything to say. Who said you can go in? I was just following Dry-bones. Who said you can go in then? Fatty was following so I was just going ahead. Yes! Dry-bones, you'll be posted at the military band room, okay? Yes, thank you. Thank you, sergeant. Sorry to everyone. Salute! As you were. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. Right shoulder arms! To the rear, march! To the rear, march! There's no letter from Ok-hwa and Eun-ju. Maybe they changed their mind while we weren't around? This is too weird. They must have changed. How can they not send us any letter? Hey, if Eun-ju had changed her mind, I'll... Come on. You such a... Hey, why're you crying like a child? Don't be a loser. Laugh. Come on, mother. You got his name 'Fatty' wrong. Oh, right. So this is how you write Fatty. Okay, it's good now. Well I don't know if it's a letter or a picture. Oh, mother. It's been a month already. What if they're angry for not getting any letter? I'm sure they'll be okay once they see my letter. Don't worry. Mother's letter and our letters are different though. I said I'll be sending a letter with my own handwriting soon. You don't have to worry. They would not know what's going on here. That's possible. Even if they misunderstand, if they see this letter they'll praise what you did. They wouldn't imagine I'm learning handwriting from you two. Now finish the letter and send them. You really learned very quickly. I learned so fast because of the passionate teachers. Then go on with the letter. We'll be practicing our song. Okay. If everyone do their assigned jobs so well like this... ...our nation's unification is not far away. You sound smart today. You think I was a fool then? Hey, what kind of salute is that? I did that because two officers were coming from both sides. Why don't you salute separately? Since both of you are second lieutenant... I didn't know where to salute first so I tried to be fair. - Be careful from now on. - Okay sir. Can I go now? - Go ahead. - Okay. Salute! You think I'm a fool? Hey, I'll be at the meeting room for a while. Take care of my jacket and my helmet. Yes, sir. I have the physique of a general. Come in. Second Lieutenant Choi Man-bok. I had something to discuss. Hey, wait a while. Yes, sir. Go to the meeting room... Oh no, you can't go to the meeting room. Go wait at the P.X. The P.X. is not open yet. It's an order. Tell them to open now. Yes, sir. Dry-bones. What's wrong with you, you fool? You're worse than Fatty all the time. This is exciting! This is cool. Feels so good. What brings you here? Why aren't you reporting? I finished taking care of the jacket and helmet. I understand that you want to try them. You should try hard to become a general. Okay, I will. There's nothing you can't do if you try hard. My heart is beating and my legs are shivering. Let me go out for a while. Okay. Salute! Hey, Dry-bones. Where're you going? Hey, it's an exciting day today. What's so exciting? Listen to me. You know what? The lieutenants were saluting at me. What? Why? I've become a major general. It was so funny. Hey, hey! Did you eat something wrong? You think I'm lying? Gosh. Salute! How did you become a major general? Well, actually... So what happened? Hey, hey! Carry on, carry on. We're practicing how to salute. I guess this is good enough, right? Hey, I think I'll go crazy hanging around with you. I'm better than you. What is this? Everyone else is on combat training and you're washing socks? Gosh! Like what the instructor told us, you should first identify a target. And pull the trigger with determination, okay? Yes! Hey, shouldn't one of us go to the shooting match or boxing? Don't even think about boxing. Everyone says there's no one who can beat Fatty. Damn, if it was just a fight, Fatty would have been a piece of cake for me. - Of course! - Why not? Who is chatting during training? Who is it, huh? Trainee Yang, why aren't you answering? Cheating is the worst thing in the military. Now tell me. Okay, it's right here. Is it trainee Won? - Yes. - And who? It was me and trainee Jung. Three of you come out. Come to me after the training. Yes. I'll not let Yang go away with this. Hello? Anyone in there? Who is it? - Oh, hello. - You were here. Oh, welcome. What's up? What brings you here? It's nothing special. Come up. Let's go. Sit down. Were you sick? Haven't seen you for a while. I'm not sick but actually doing great. I'm even gaining weight. Take some cigarette. Oh really? We shouldn't have worried then. Why worry? Because we couldn't see you at all after Fatty joined the army... ...and your lights were up till late night. There were lots of rumors in town. Come on, nothing's wrong. That's what I'm saying. There were weird rumors like you're in somatization disorder after Fatty joined the army. Nonsense. It's a good thing that your son joined army. Why would one worry? I know. I guess people who worry doesn't have any other things to do. So, did they want you to visit? It's not them. We just dropped by out of curiosity. Oh, come on. You were the one who came to me and pushed me to visit. That was a bolt from the blue. So you're saying I was instigating you to visit? Oh, so you're saying you didn't? You're trying to blame it all on me? So, you didn't? - I asked you to go? - You didn't? - When did I say that? - So you didn't? - You didn't? - Why're you blaming on me? - You didn't? - I asked you? You came to me and asked to visit her. This is crazy. Well, whoever asked, you're welcome. Actually, the reason I didn't go out... ...was because I was studying to write a letter. Why didn't you ask the women to write the letter? I thought it would be better if I write it myself. Here, take a look. I've written this much. Oh, it's a long letter. Dear Fatty. After you joined the army, I'm doing great without any worries. Eating well and sleeping well. That's not eating well, it's doing well. Doing well is eating well. But the words are different. The words are different but the meaning is same. How can they be same? - How can they not? - They're not same. Geez, you picking on me again? - What the... - You want to a piece of me? Come on, you two are fighting again. Stop it. Oh, hi. Hello. You two are so pretty. - How can you be so pretty? - Staring that chat again. Hey, it's like flowers blooming at your house. - You're so lucky. - Hey. - Let's stop chatting and leave. - Can't you see I'm leaving? Such pretty girls. Bye then. Take care, bye. - Bye. - Bye then. I'll get going. You're so chatty today. Here, mother. What is this? Today was a payday. So we've made some clothes for you. Hope you like it. Oh my, thank you. Why're you sitting over there? Come here. Oh, come on here. Come on, okay? We should have written the letter first. You don't have to worry about that. What if there's a misunderstanding and he changes his mind. Don't worry, he's a big boy. And very understanding, so don't worry about that. Why so plaintive all of a sudden? Listen. How can I not be angry? Do you know what she first said to me? "Mr. Fatty." "I would be so happy if I were to get married to you." Then she showed off all her charms and now, not even a letter? Well, that's same for me. Get some sleep. - Dry-bones. - Why? My stomach. Let's go to the restroom together. Why all of a sudden? Seems like I got indigestion from the anger. You did eat a lot with such anger. I have to eat when I'm angry. Or else I'd be angrier. Nice excuse, huh? You have to make men worry once in a while. You shouldn't be too tied up on them, and also you don't leave them alone for too long. Then what should we do, mother? Feels like I'll lose him. Just leave it up to me. I know much better about them than you two. We'll just believe in you then. I said not to worry. Who is it? It's trainee Dry-bones. Why're you standing there? That's because trainee Fatty is inside. Why're you standing there if Fatty is inside? We've sworn to be together all the time. I like that mind. I think so too. All three of us have the same thought. Put your hand down. - Put your hand down. - Okay. Gosh. Hurry up. The moonlight is particularly bright tonight, mother. I can remember clearly what you told me... ...on the night when you took me to hills to watch the moon. Grow up and become a great man. Look, mother. Me in my military uniform. Why couldn't you have lived longer? Mother. Mother. - Hey. - What? Come here. Why did you want to see me? This is it! Eat this! This is what you get if you behave like that. Get down, you bastard. If you tell anyone about this, you'll be dead, huh? Hey, isn't that Yang? What happened? Did you fight with someone? Oh, you have blood. What happened? Who hit you? Did you hit him? What the... Who hit you? Speak up. Leave me alone. Let's go in. Oh, what a silly. Why did you let them hit you? - Gosh. - Oh god. Leave me, I'm okay. What's wrong? Hey, what happened? Why he's not talking? There's a wound in his face. Let's go and report to the first sergeant. We don't have to report. We can handle this ourselves. Hey, let's go get some sleep. How can you sleep after all this? Right, I guess I can't sleep. Take Yang to the medical office and others go to sleep. What? I know who hit him. - So what? - What? Why're you fighting? I'm okay. We're all brothers. Let's not fight with each other. Mother, mother. I should write let's break up, right? That's right. Make it clean and simple. Don't have to meet her ever again. Show her what a man's decision means. Hurry up. Gosh. Don't hurry too much. Who knows she will come visit you today? Come visit? They didn't even write a letter. You think they'll visit? So how can a man thinking about his lover... ...participate in a war for the country? Okay then. There's no need to leave your feelings for woman. She'll cry out loud reading this letter. I guess not just crying. Dry-bones, it's a misunderstanding. I don't want to break up at all. Our love will be forever. You bitch. Just slap her like this. Damn. Slicker. Let's go. Military mail. We'll fall in love together and dump them together too. You and I are one soul. Let's put it in together. No, you suggested to write this letter, right? So you go first. What? Okay then. I guess they'll feel bad when they get this. Of course. They'll regret a lot. This is the last. So this would be a farewell letter. How about you go first? What? You want me to break up alone? No, I'll break up eventually too. Hey, a man's word is as good as a bond. Aren't you a man? We're brave soldiers. If we make a decision, we go for it. Send it or not. Send it or not. Such a coward. Okay. Then we'll break up together. Okay. Dry-bones and Fatty! You have visitors from home. Go to the visitor office. Wow, that was close. What did I say? I told you there might be some visitors. No wonder I didn't want to put the letter in. We're good now. Let's tear it up now. - Torn! - Let's go. Let's go. We're full even if we don't eat. Great, sit down. - Okay. - Come on. Ma'am, could you sit a little closer? It doesn't matter how I'm taken. Please make sure the baby and the father look great. Don't worry. How is it? Before joining the army. I'm doing great. I've become very healthy. I'm thankful. Eat some more. I've had enough. - Have some more. - Okay. Hey. Mom. Ma'am. How have you guys been? We're doing great. Look at us. Salute to the mother. You seem to have gained weight. Sit down, mother. Come sit here, Dry-bones. Did you come alone? Can't I come alone? I guess your family will visit too. I don't have any family so there's no one to visit. Then let's go with me and eat. You must be lonely but don't let yourself down. A man should not show tears to other people. Let's eat. Why aren't you eating? Why not? How would I feel if you don't eat what I've prepared? Whatever. You eat first, Fatty. This is great. You like it? You should eat too. Do you like it? It's amazing. - Come on. - I shouldn't be eating. But I'm only eating since you prepared so much. Okay okay. Eat them all. Here you go. Oh god. Come on. What are you doing here on such an exciting day? What's so exciting? Why not? The entertainment team is visiting. We're going to see a great show today. I'm not talking about that. Then what? Are you thinking about Eun-ju again? Stop thinking about her. Think about it. Not a single letter or a visit. Are they serious? That's why I told you we should just break up. Then promise me that you wouldn't change if they cry for you. For sure. Okay. - We've got an issue, guys. - What's wrong? Can you guys take some time before the entertainment team arrives? How could we? Hear that cheering. Do whatever you can. Hey, let's just go and see. - Please. - Come on. Hello, everyone. You talk. No you talk. We're really sorry but there's a delay for the entertainment team's arrival. Please hold on for a moment. Thank you. Cut it out! Hey, what should we do? There's nothing we can do. Let's sing anything. Okay, everybody. We're not very good at singing but we'll just do it for you all. Great, great. So funny, Dry-bones and Fatty. We meet again here today. We spread laughter all the time. What would you want today? We're always happy. A great duo, singing with a smile. Yeonmudae Open Theater. So funny, Dry-bones and Fatty. We meet again here today. We spread laughter all the time. What would you want today? We're always happy. A great duo, singing with a smile. We could have met if we arrived a bit earlier. We'll be able to meet them afterwards. They would be surprised if we go up to the stage from the seat. Hey girl, gathering wild herbs in the flower basket. Even if the castor bean, camellia flower are beautiful. It can't be more so than my love that I long for Ari Ari dong dong Sri Sri dong dong. Sing that Arirang humming for me. Gosh, are you smiling now? What's wrong with you? This is not what we've talked about earlier? I'm not smiling because I'm happy. Hey girl, gathering wild herbs. Even if that smiling doggy... She sings so well. You still want to praise her? It can't be more than my sincerity of my pray at midnight Ari Ari dong dong Sri Sri dong dong. Hello. Come in. Hello. Say hi. They are the singers at the broadcasting station who sang today. Not going to say hi? Sir, we know them very well. Oh, do you? Yes. Why aren't you talking? I know you must be angry. But... It's not because of the lack of love or sincerity. It's all just an excuse. So you're saying you didn't have money for a postcard? You didn't have 20 hwan? Why're you acting like a dumb? I guess you still love me. Go away. You can't do this to a soldier. If so, look at this letter. Your mother wrote it for herself. My mother? 'I told Eun-ju and Ok-hwa not to write a letter.' 'Don't take it wrong.' So my mother wanted to test on us. - It was all on purpose. - Yes. Then why didn't you tell me from the beginning? Dry-bones, Dry-bones? It was a misunderstanding. Dry-bones, Dry-bones. - Come here, Fatty. - He's over there. Regiment Boxing Tournament Location: Platoon HQ Open Theater. You should win. Win for our regiment. No worries. How's your condition, Fatty? You don't have to worry. No matter whom it is. He will knock him down. Go for it. No worries for tomorrow's match, Fatty? I heard the opponent is also a great boxer. No problem at all. Really? - Dry-bones. - What? - I have an ask for you. - What is it? I can't do this. What? What are you saying? He's fat and big but don't know how to use power. - It would be embarrassing. - What's wrong? Why can't you do it? You can dodge because you're fast. But since I'm sluggish, I'll get into trouble if I get a hit. I'll be flown all the way to Seoul if I get a hit. It would actually be good if you go all the way to Seoul. You can meet your lover. Oh man, stop that. For you, the opponent would feel sorry and not hit you like crazy. You think so? Of course. How could he hit someone who only has bones left? Actually there's nowhere to hit. That's right. Can you please go instead of me? Then can you keep it as a secret to Ok-hwa, even if I get hurt? Of course. A secret to Eun-ju, too. Okay. You shouldn't tell that you covered for me. Be quiet for each other. - Good luck then. - Don't worry. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. We'll now start the final match for the Regiment Boxing Tournament. At the left corner, we have Kim Han-Yong from the 30th Regiment. Official weighing 220 pounds. And in the other corner, there is Dry-bones from 26th Regiment, who all of you know. You got it?
