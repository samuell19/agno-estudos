[Nagasaki School] [Three years ago] What else is there? You forgot your brush! - I want to go, too. - You'll be fine. Bye Bye! The Girl of Silence Shizuko, hold it steady. - The handles are too long. - I told you, it’s easier to carry it alone. Chie, don't cling to my dress. - I want a red dress, too. - You don't need one. - Why? - Red doesn't suit you. Sis, you'll look bad in red! We couldn't go anywhere. - Warm watermelon doesn't taste good, does it? - That's right, Chie. Oh, I got so worked up that my makeup is running. Mom, look. Electrician Dejima. Thank you. Wow, an electric refrigerator! Honey, you really bought it... How can a decent family not have a refrigerator? Who is this man? This is your new dad. - Being a "dad" doesn’t suit me. - But that's... - Won't you be a dad? - No. Can't you be dad? Or what do you want? Let me be "Father". Father. Did you hear? Good morning, Father. Good morning. Goodbye. "Father" sounds so stupid. Here's money for a bun. - Thank you, mother. - Not at all, daughter. Mother, thank you. - Goodbye, mother. - Chie! Don't call me "mother" so loudly. What will the neighbors think? That guy with the fridge... Is he really going to be our father? He's gonna run away anyway. But he doesn't look like the previous one at all. What if he will be right this time? - Dummy! - Old Hag! - What are you hiding there? - None of your business. Must be a love letter from that boy whose father is a doctor. Sis, are you planing to get married? - Dummy. - Old Hag! Old Hag! Have you looked at mine? I read yours. Hiroki-kun The lid fell off. Why are you growing that nail? Cool! Shizuko, want one? Shizuko, you got talent. I will become a mangaka. - You should go to Tokyo for school. - Really? Will you take me? What stupid dreams. - Nothing will come of it. - Teki-teki. - What? - You don't hear the sound? - Dear, what are you doing? - What, what... - It's too hot... - Something like that? - That's not it. - It's not? I'm home. Chie, Shizuko! Father is back. Welcome back. Hello. It's my first time here. I like it. What? - Let's do it. - I don't want to. - I want. - I don't. - Why? - I'm not interested. I love you! What happened? Looks like... I'm afraid... of heights. Sorry for making you wait. Come on. I don't know how to dance like them. And they perform with the crowd, all together doing the jitterbug. So much so that I don't know whether they're dancing or hugging. Hey. Don't sulk. Why so sad? Akemi, could you stop working in a club? - That's unexpected... - You're still a mother. Didn't you think it would be bad for the upbringing of children? How do you think I should feed them? Here is your allowance. As the father of a decent family, I don't want any of you to work for money. I... I will stay with you. - Not too tight? - It's fine. If it starts to pinch, ask your sister. Chieko, let's go. - Chieko? - From now on I will call you that. Mom, why aren't you dressed? I won't go. In a decent family, the mother's role is to look after the house. - Yes, so you three will go. - Chieko, let's go. Father, can we buy this? Buy it! Takoyaki! Sis, hurry up. - Come on. - I don't need this. - I'm already in high school. - So what? - I can walk without holding hands. - What are you talking about? I hold you so I won't lose you. Sis, what if you get lost? - Still a child and already such weird thoughts. - What does "weird" mean? Chieko, give me a nail. Oh, father is building us a good bathhouse! Now you don't have to go to public one. - Shizuko, isn't it wonderful? - But I like the public bath. I'm glad we have our own bath now. Grow faster, grow better. Your mom is acting too weird in front of father. I can finally call myself Chie again and not Chieko. That's right. You can drop "ko" while father isn't home. - I hope he won't come back. - And who will bring the money? He's not a bad person, just not very pleasant. - But he's not good either. - I don't like anything about him. Shizuko, don't be naughty. Father brings us money, right? I don't know how long it will last but for now, Thank you, father. - I'm home. - Mother! Get dressed, hurry up! - Why does father disappear sometimes? - Maybe he goes to another family. - Where is his other house? - I don't know, you should ask mom. - And who is in that house? - Such a nuisance. Go ask him yourself. Stop bathing already, time to get out. Even in the bathroom there is no peace. Your boobs have grown, so he wants to see. - Gross. - Show me, it won't hurt you. - Dummy! - Old hag! Sis, you have not only boobs, but your stomach has grown. It's solid. - Don't make me upset. - Please knock if you come in. I hope you're smart enough to quit drawing these stupid manga. - I don't think manga is stupid. - Manga is complete bullshit. Useless low-grade books that belong in the trash. - Give it back! - Come to bed. - Give it back! - Give it back! Don't torture yourself. You will definitely regret it. - I won't regret it. - Shizuko. Be an adult. As the father of a respectable family, I place my hopes on you. Rotten! Akemi! Everything rotten. How is it possible to live in such a poor house... - I understand. - What do you understand? - Sorry. - What do I need your "sorry" now? Be quiet. You are no housewife. I'm leaving. - That's enough for you. - I haven't had enough! Have a good day. What an idiot! It's always like this before he goes to that house. You have to let him let off steam or he won't come back. Why? When you become an adult you will understand it better. I don't want to understand it. Can we still eat this? We help you clean. I'll marinate something... Put everything in here, we'll make pickles. - I'll wear it next time. - It's too late for that. I didn't get my period. Or maybe it's just delayed this time. Pregnant... - Is there a way to find out if I'm pregnant? - There is. - I haven't heard of it. - There is. - Probably... - And if I'm really pregnant? Let's go find out first. You got it? I bought a band-aid. You scared me. Don't sneak up on me like that. I thought it was your father. He doesn't like it when I sing. "Don't act like a fool" he says. Can I at least sing when he's not around? Mom, my bra got too small. What are you talking about? I just bought it for you. My chest hurts because it pinches. At your age, this is normal. You still grow. I also feel tired. - And I'm always cold. - By God, give me a break. Go and take your father's pills. I have a delayed period. Just don't tell me you're pregnant. Mom, I'm already fourteen! A clear heartbeat. Congratulations. - Mom... - Who is the father? Sooner or later I'll find out anyway. Masuta-kun. Masuta Hiroki, his father runs a hospital. Son of a doctor and he doesn't know about condoms? What to do? I don't know what to do with your antics. Why did you do that? You were a good student and now... Getting pregnant at fourteen... - I'd be ashamed to leave the house again. - I'm not ashamed. - I love Hiroki-kun. - Stupid! This is not good for you! You are just like your father. - But Mom, you loved him. - Loved him, so what? Love alone won't feed you. - Love is the most important thing in a relationship. - Oh, I can't listen to this. I'm over that. Your ideas about Hiroki are out of touch with reality. The real world is not as friendly as you make it out to be. It's true! When you grow up, you will understand what I mean. I don't even want to think about your father. And when I look at your face... Shizuko, what should I do? How will you tell him? - Are you still awake? - Chie, go to bed! Let's go. - Right now? - You get ready, too. Should I go as well? Yes, we are a great family. What will they think if she is without a mother? I'm so messy. I should at least have put on my kimono. We are not at a show. We are empty handed. Maybe go buy something as a gift? You still don't understand why we are here? What are you staring at? I, as his father, as a sign of apology, promise that I will take care of the upbringing. I would like to discuss their future with you. Is there any better way to handle this... Accept our apologies. We will try to satisfy your wishes. Look, it wasn't just her body that suffered, but her mind as well. - Excuse me, but is it only our Hiroki's fault? - Why, no. - Are you saying it's Shizuko's fault?! - Honey, let's go home. - What are you doing? - Sorry to disturb you. - Excuse us. - What are you apologizing for? Whose side are you on? I'm exhausted and I just want to go to sleep. - You sleep in a lot of places. - Don't start. - What's wrong with that? - Not in front of the child. Be quiet, please. May I ask, what did you come here for? What for? - Who do you think you're talking to? - Calm down. - Please stop. - You stay out of this. - What are you smiling about? - It's my first time in a taxi. For the second time tonight Well, well... You're not going to do that ever again. Understood? Stay with me all the time. I'll make sure you never do it again. Here... I'll sew it up for you. That guy... How many times have you been with him? Children shouldn't behave like this. I, your father, have to deal with this... Do something. It will be five months soon. It's difficult to have an abortion in the fifth month. Doctors don't really want to go there. So your father wanted to check it out. Get rid of the fetus after that. Why suck on my breasts for that? Well, he probably got worked up and couldn't help himself... Your father is still a man. What? Mother! Sorry for the inconvenience we caused. Be more careful from now on. - Was it a boy or a girl? - You want to know? Put on your coat. - Shizuko, it's best not to ask. - That's right. Do you want to eat Chinese noodles? - Hiroki-kun transferred to another school. - Yeah... This happens a lot. Nothing bad happened. Let's forget about it. Turns out, it's not so easy to die. Skipping school? - I know a good place, let's go. - Don't touch me! So small, and what an ugly face. Why are you acting up? School uniforms suit me less and less. - How you want it? - Please, make it shorter. Real short! You sure? Shorter! But I don't think... Akemi-san, you're wanted at table 18. Seizo, please wait a moment. Don't you dare leave. Table 18. - I said no to you on the phone, and you... - What's not to your liking? - If only you didn't live in two houses. - I'm letting you work here anyway. All I wanted was to make some money... - I won't let you play lottery. - It's for pocket money. Sometimes I just feel like dancing. Look, you're actually a mother. A mother with a decent family. I need breaks too. The trouble with Shizuko is precisely because you act like that. Anyway... Quit the club. I'm home. - Your father was worried about you. - I'm sorry. You didn't do anything weird this time? Shizuko doesn't understand that word. Oh, man! Father will punish her. You want to become a mangaka? I'll go to Tokyo. I like it. This drawing. It's cold in here. You know it? Sometimes I hear... someone's footsteps. And I've heard them forever. They are my steps. The steps of myself in the future. How are you? How is the new school? Fallen in love with somebody? - I won't fall in love with anyone. - Why not? Because I love you Shizu-chan. I ran away from you at a difficult time... We didn't know any better. I'm a coward. Can we forget about it? I can't forget about it! I really love you. And I realized something. I didn't love you one bit. Hello, sis. - I said hello, old hag. - Shut up, Dummy! Yes, when Shizuko is in a bad mood, it's scary to mess with her. Don't cry. - Your father is waiting for you. - Will he punish her again? I won't go to him. So stubborn... Go ahead. How am I stubborn? You father doesn't come here because he wants to do this. It's so that you don't give us any more trouble in the future. I won't do it anymore. What if you want to do it again, after the first time? It's our nature. At least your father is properly protected. And anyway, you're one family, why bother? Chie, tell me it's better this way, than to get pregnant. What is sister's punishment? It hurts. It hurts! What are you afraid of? I won't leave you for anything. What are you doing? What the hell are you up to?! Chieko, bring the hammer and nails. - What do you want to do with Shizuko? - Are you stupid or what? Why don't you listen to your father? You don't understand how I feel! You will stay here for the rest of your life! Like a fingernail. You have beautiful nails. Why are you growing this one? Cool. - Isn't that nice, Shizuko? - What? - That father is at another house. - Yeah. You' be punished if your father came today. I hope he won't come back. Why do you say that? Stop doing that. He can only when it is reciprocated, he is so lame. Break up with him already. You need a father first and foremost. Mom, don't you care? About what? That I am forced to take it. - And what is there to take? - Are you pretending? He's raping me. Is that so? Are you being raped? Then why don't you report it to the police? I could have gone there a long time ago. What are you staring at? Are you sure you're not confusing anything? It appears that you are sleeping with my husband. Isn't it? So why are you crying about it to me? Cut it out, come on. You are my mother, after all. Well, yes. Yes, I am a mother. Sort of like a mother. I'm confused about what kind of mother I am. Let's stop, let me enjoy the sake. Don't be grouchy here. I've already... started to forget that you are perverts. You have disappointed me. You've lost your way again without me. Soon as I'm not at home, you've got this trash on your desk. Want to get punished again? Let's go. Because of this... my feelings for you won't change. They won't change. "Medical Office" - I get sleepy very quickly. - Is that why you were in the infirmary? I slept all the time, because of my illness. Under the influence of sleeping pills. Come on! I don't want to go back! I want to be here! Where have you been? I was worried. I will no longer obey you. I was waiting for you. You won't punish me anymore. I... - love my daughter, like a decent father. - Stop! You are not my father. How stubborn you are. Let's go somewhere where no one can find us. We will live together. Shizuko... give me your love! Can't you slow down? Are you okay? Clown. - Long time no see. How are you? - Did you come to meet me? - Did you? - Shizuko, wait. I came back to live with you again. In my old age, it finally dawned on me. I'm going to be a decent father from now on. What's that? - Nothing. - Wait, Shizuko. I'm already broke and not young either. Let me be your father. I don't need a father any more. My father is dead. He died for me. I killed him. Found it. [183 - Tanaka Shizuko] Sis, hurry up! Or the cake will melt. - Congratulations - Thank you. Blow out the candle. Look at the center of the lens. Father, raise your head.
