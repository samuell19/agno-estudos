Hurry up! You'll be late for the writing camp! I'm done, Ma. I'm coming out. [phone ringing] [Xavier's mom] Hi, son! Hey, Mom! Hey, Dad! Ma! Yes? Ma, I'll go ahead. Wait. Don't forget these. Ma, I don't need them anymore. It's already been a month. Look. -I can even dance. Join me. -Wow! [both chuckling] [Xavier's dad] Do you really have to go to that writing camp? Dad, it's a requirement for one of my subjects. I don't have a choice. Don't worry, it's just gonna be a week. I gotta go. I love you, guys. [Xavier's mom] Love you! Take care. Hello? Hey, I'm near. I'm already outside. Hello. Hi. [theme music playing] Hey, babe! Hi. Sorry, traffic. Did I keep you waiting? Well, what's new? -I'm sorry. -It's okay. -Ready? -Ready! I can't feel the enthusiasm. One more time! Are... you... ready?! [screams] Ready! [cheering] [chanting] Shaggedy shaggedy shapopo! [Junjun] Guys, say hi for my vlog, "Junjun is Big Now!" Wow! Vlog! Yes! It's about me growing up with the joys and pains of life. Cool, right? [Seph] Include me in the frame. So guys, don't forget to like and subscribe. And comment down below. [Seph] Yes, sir! Guys, someone's not happy. He's sulking over here. Mico, are you okay? Babe, can we stop over somewhere? I'm suddenly craving sweets. Of course! What do you want? We can get chocolates... Chocolates? Or ice cream? We can also get milk tea. Never mind. We might get caught up in traffic. Hey! Why are you guys so serious? I'm okay. I'm good. Are you sure? Of course! Okay, then. Answer the question of the peephole-- It's "people." That's what I said. Answer the question of the people, Mico-- Are you over him? Yes, Mico! What's the score? I'm fine. I'm happy. See? But in fairness, you act normal during online classes. As if you're just strangers again. Come on, Kookai. It's been months. It doesn't matter! He still broke Mico's heart. You know, Xavier's decision wasn't easy either. And we don't know what really happened. Junjun, are you siding with that guy? I'm not siding with anyone. My point is let's be fair-- -No. -There are two sides-- Guys! Enough! Why are you more affected than me? Let's just enjoy the trip, okay? [Kookai] Agree! You're right. Besides, I don't blame him for choosing his girlfriend. They have history. And can we not talk about them, please? Fine! Let's just enjoy the writing camp! Yes? -Yes! -[whooping, cheering] Young Padawans! [all] May the force be with us! [cheering] [instrumental music plays] [instrumental music continues] Cool! Seph, look! Congrats! Your poster's amazing! You should use it for your application to the Multimedia Arts program. Hey, don't-- [tuts] You're shifting courses? I thought we're all going to med school together? Don't get me involved. I'm just a social media influencer slash vlogger. Stupid! The three of us here are your only subscribers! Four if you include my mom! -[James] Bro! -James! -How are you? -What's up? -I'm good, man. -Hi. Did you guys just get here? Yes and I can't wait to leave. -Why? -[Crystal] Why? [James] What are we even doing here? This writing camp is so... ...gay. -Dude. -James. My moms said you shouldn't say things like that. Read up so you know what's politically correct now. And while you're at it, familiarize yourself with the Anti-Discrimination Bill. You shouldn't say things like that. Whatever, guys! Kooks... You know that this is my passion, right? But I didn't expect you to shift courses! Not to mention you told Junjun first. I was going to tell you. Kooks, I'm sorry. Hmph! [Seph] Kookai, wait! -Need help? You brought a lot. -Yeah. Thank you, Arvin. -Mind helping? -I'll get that small bag. No, that one. Hey! Why do you keep looking around? We just got here and you're already looking for him? Who? Who, my butt. I was just wondering... why we are the only ones here. [Junjun] Even though the pandemic is over, the school reserved the resort for our safety. Let's go. Babe? Let's go? -[Crystal] Let's go. -Yeah. [Seph] Kookai, I'm sorry. I was really going to tell you. Kookai, talk to me. Kookai. Kookai, I'm sorry. Hey. Kookai. Kookai, please. [Kookai] My sister's here! Karen! [nervous chuckle] Kookai! Hi. Hi. [smooches] What are you doing here? They invited me to be a co-lecturer. Why? You don't seem pleased. No, I was just surprised. [clears throat] And you are? I'm-- Oh! This is Seph. My friend. This is Mico and that's Junjun. -Hello, hello. -They're also my friends. Okay. I'll talk to you later. Okay. [mouthing] Talk later? I'm just a friend? But I guess you're right. We've been unofficial for six months now. [scoffs] That's just it, right? Seph... My sister is really strict. And single since birth. Imagine her reaction if she finds out about us. World war. [scoffs] Seph... Are you upset with me? -Hey! Come on! -Fine! Okay. I understand. Are we okay now? Okay. Thank you. [Karen] Okay, okay! Hello, everyone! And welcome to LitCamp! [cheering] [Karen] For this weeklong writing camp, we'll have the usual classroom setup. We have activities that will ignite your creativity. And it will end with a very fun costume party! [cheering] I hope you brought your costumes as literary characters. I brought mine. And to inspire you to write, we have also invited guest speakers, and one of them is the award-winning writer and alumnus of our university, Alexander Markova! Oh my God! He's coming here? Who's Alexander? Here. Look! He wrote this. It's a collection of essays about being in the closet. Alexander Markova is just his pseudonym, like Bob Ong. He's finally revealing himself! -Get his autograph. -Yes! For the room assignments, we'll be drawing lots. Boys and girls will be separated, of course. So you will draw a number and the person with the same number as yours will be your roommate. Okay. Get one and pass. Who got seven? Seven? One. [screaming] Lucky best friends! They got the same room. You're never going to separate, are you? Never! Because... we're boyfriends now. Aww! Congrats! Since last week. He finally got the courage to admit his feelings. I hope everyone does. [laughing] Mico, who's your roommate? Help me find him. Room number eight. Just shout it out. Excuse me! Who got room eight? [soft guitar music plays] [music continues] Thank you. [bags thud] Sorry. I'm used to being on top. Okay. I'll adjust. Mico? I want to say sorry in advance if I snore... or if I shake the bed too much at night. And I think we should schedule our shower time so the other won't-- Xavier, relax. Chill. Mico... About what happened... Don't mention it. It's all in the past, right? So... Let's just forget it, okay? So... Friends? Sure. I'm just going to take a shower. Yeah. Sure. I have to change too. [soft guitar music plays] -Here? -Yeah. Ah! Why, babe? I forgot something. Excuse me. -I'll just get it. -Okay. [Mico] Where's the towel? It's cold. Oh my God! What are you doing here? I forgot something. Then go get it! That's what I forgot. [comical sound] This? Wait. Don't look! Turn around! [door closes] [door closes] Okay, class! Settle down! Before we start with our lecture, I would like to introduce to you our main facilitator. [clapping] [instrumental music plays] [Mico] What's all those stuff for? Ma'am, what are those? -Why is there a smoke machine? -[Karen] I don't know too. [cheering] It's Ms. Tina! Yo! Yo! Yo! What's up, party people? You thought I left you guys? Nuh-uh! Of course not! If it's literature, who are you gonna call? Ma'am Tina! When I say Tina, you say Moran. Tina! [all] Moran! -Tina! -[all] Moran! Tina, that's enough. Hi, class! Again, welcome to "LitCamp: Journey To The Truth!" Cool, right? The activities and exercises that we will be doing are all related to finding our truth so we can get to know ourselves better. This will help you be truthful in your writing. Okay, let's begin! I'll randomly pair you up. All you have to do is take a picture outside. You'll show the photo to the class later and explain why you chose that particular photo. What does that photo say about you as a person? [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [Arvin] Even here, your eyes are still on Crystal? You got it bad, bro. [chuckles] [James] This is ridiculous! I thought we're going to swim? It's a workshop, James. Stop complaining. Wow! Flowers. That's so gay. And what's it to you? What? What's it to you? What did you say? James, please. Don't you have better things to do? You can just leave. I'm just kidding! Right? Well, it's not funny, James. Okay. Thank you, Crystal. It's nothing. Don't mind James. Still, thank you. Excuse me. I'll just go to Xavier. Babe? -[Crystal] Can we take a selfie? -[Xavier] Yeah, of course. One, two, three! Sir, where's the projector? It's in one of these boxes. I kept it since no one's using it. [on walkie-talkie] Ruben, a pipe burst! Come here, quick! Sir, I'm needed outside. Okay. I'll just look for it myself. Just don't close the door. It locks by itself. I'll fix it later. Okay. Thank you. [door slams shut] Why are you here? Ma'am Tina asked me to get the extension cord for the projector. Shit. Why did you close the door? [knocking] Help! -Anyone? -Mico... [knocking] -Help! -Hey, are you okay? The door is busted. Help! -Hey, Mico... -[knocking] Anybody there? Mico, relax! We'll get out of here. Promise. [bangs door] Why did it have to be busted? Sorry. I look like a fool. The door locks by itself. I wonder who made it. What a failure! I'm rambling again. Okay. So... What if... What if we break down this door? What if we don't? [both chuckle] You didn't have to make such an effort with that singing! Why? You even sang with me, right? You know, we need something to remember this day. Perfect! I have a camera here. Wait. -Okay. -How do you use this? On. Off. -Just click this button. -This? [photo ejects] And then you do this. Oh, okay. [soft instrumental music plays] Please don't. I'm still a baby. Okay. It's no problem. I'm willing to wait. [both chuckle] What if... you didn't answer her call? [phone ringing] Excuse me. Hello? Calm down. Just breathe. Relax. I'm not at home but... I can be there in 30 minutes. What if... she didn't need you? Mico. Crystal? Her parents just separated. She's being hysterical right now. She doesn't know what to do and... Mico, she's got no one else to talk to. Go. Go to her. I'll drive you home. No need. I can take care of myself. Go. She needs you right now. Mico, I'm really sorry. I just need to take care of this but I promise, I'll tell Crystal about us. Mico... you know I was serious... when I said I wanted us to be friends again. I can't promise you that, Xavier. But I'll try. And I appreciate that you're making an effort. [doorknob rattles] [Xavier] What are you reading? I'm reading Alexander's book again. I'm just preparing so I'm ready when I meet him. So is he your crush now? I don't know. We'll find out. Okay. Stop bothering me. Just focus on what you're doing. I didn't understand the lecture earlier so I really don't know what I'm doing. Wait. That's easy. Let me see. It's just about your dreams and aspirations in life so you can get to know yourself more. But I don't know what to write. Why not basketball? Well, that's my dad's dream. He didn't become a pro so he wants me to achieve his dream. Well, what do you really want to do? I'm not sure. Do I have to know now? No. You'll find out eventually. And whatever makes you happy, I'm sure your parents will support you. Thanks, Mico. It's the first time I talked to somebody about this. Ever. And thank you, as always, for listening to my issues. Of course. I'm just here for you. As a friend. Okay. Right. Of course, as a friend. [Kookai] I'm craving something but I don't know what. Do you have suggestions? Wait, I have something here. What's that? Hold on. -Wow! -Perfect! You're the best, Mico! Let's have it cooked? [Kookai] Sure! Miss? Can we have this cooked? Sure, sir. Miss, can you add cheese, bacon, and egg on mine? Please? -Sure, ma'am. -Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good timing! I'm hungry! Thank you, Mico. [Kookai] It's here! Thank you, miss. Finally, it's here! I've been waiting for you for the longest time! [Seph] Can I try yours? Is it good with cheese? [Kookai] Yes! It's my favorite! -[Seph] Thank you. -No problem. [Seph] It's good. I know! So good. Mico, why are you so busy? Is that for our exercise? You're being extra in class again. No, Xavier asked me to check this. It's his assignment. -Who? -[Mico] Xavier. And why are you doing that? I'm just checking it. And we're friends, right? I'm just doing this as a friend. Be sure you're doing that only as a friend. We supported you back then because he and Crystal broke up. But now that they're back together? No way. Of course. I know my place. [reggae music plays] [Tina] Point left. -Point right. -Point right. -Then do a circle. -Circle. That's right! Feel the circle! Perfect! I love it! For sure you'll find a boyfriend now. Or girlfriend. Whatever floats your boat. Come on! Kookai might get a boyfriend before you. I don't have time for that. And I've also been telling Kookai to introduce her special someone to me if she has one. So I can judge the guy. [Tina] Judge? Like a panel? Come on, let's swim! Seph, please. Listen to me. Okay. Make me understand why you can't introduce me to your sister. Uh... Let me help you. You don't want to introduce me because I am not your ideal guy. You don't want to introduce me because Mico is your standard. Am I right? He has plans and ambition. He has a future. I don't. I'm right, aren't I? Babe, I'll just take a shower. I'll meet you at the session hall? Yeah, sure. -Save me a seat. -Sure. -See ya. -See ya. [Mico] Somebody help! -[Mico] Help! -Who's that? [Mico] Help me! Help! Help! [Xavier] Mico! Are you okay? Come here. Slowly. Sit here. Are you okay? I'm not okay! Oh shit. I think you've been stung by a jellyfish. What are you doing? This happened to my cousin. I've got to pee on it. That's a myth. I'm a pre-med student, okay? Mico, it worked on my cousin. It's going to work on you too. Don't worry, I'm doing this as a friend. You're going to pee on me as a friend? Mico, calm down. This will be quick. Just look away. Fine! Do it quickly! I wanted to explain but he walked out on me. So you and Seph are not okay again? Where the heck is Mico? I left him swimming here. -[whistle] -[Junjun] Is that Mico? Mico? [Junjun] He's with Xavier. [Kookai] Yeah. Mico, we have an activity with Ma'am Tina! Come on! Mico, let's go! [Kookai] What happened to you? Huh? [sniffing] What's that smell? -Yeah! -Junjun, do you smell that? -Mico! -Mico! Guys, guys, never have I ever been ghosted. [excited chatter] She lost her phone that's why she didn't contact me. Never have I ever been kept a secret. [Mico] These two. Seph, I'm sorry. Please talk to me. Never have I ever fallen in love with someone of the same sex. Oh! Take a shot! [crowd screaming] Oh my gosh! You guys take a shot! Next, next, next. Let's go? I'll just get my bag. [door slams open] [Seph] Careful. [Kookai] Careful. Mico, you said chill drinking. But you drank way too much! -What? -Wait, wait. -Why? -I'm going to throw up. He's going to throw up. [retches] Throw up now. [retches] I just swallowed it. -Disgusting. -Let's lay you down. Just a few more steps, Mico. Watch his head. Can you please behave? Mico! Mico, we're leaving, okay? Don't leave me. Mico, behave. Seph, water. Ouch! Junjun, I'll take care of him. You sure? Babe, let them take care of him. He's their friend. -Friend? -Mico! Why? I'm also friends with Xavier. Relax. Right? [Seph] Drink water, Mico. As a friend. [Seph] Mico, drink this. -[glass shatters] -[gasps] Mico! You're a mess! Literally and figuratively! Guys, I'll take care of him. You can leave now. [Seph] Let's go, Kookai. Sorry. Xavier, sorry. And thank you. Please take care of him. Babe. I have to stay. I can't leave him like this. [Crystal] But Arvin and the others are waiting for us. [Xavier] I'll follow, promise. Okay. [drunkenly] Xavier. Next time, drink only what you can handle. So strict! Are you my boyfriend? Why do you care if I want to get wasted? We're just friends anyway, right? Isn't this what you wanted? Why can't you look at me? Xavier... Look at me, Xavier. Xavier. Do you feel something? Come on, tell me. We might feel the same thing. How did we end up like this, Xavier? What happened to us? Xavier? Good evening, ma'am. Hi, Xavier. How is she? A bit better. I got her to eat earlier. I just didn't think that she would react this way about our separation. Had I known... I'm sorry. I'm just glad that you're here for her. It might've gotten worse if you hadn't been here. You are her rock, you know that? [sizzling] Hey! Why do you insist on cooking? It's your birthday! Let's just have food delivered. Ma, this is a special birthday for me. Don't worry, Ma. I can do this. Well, if you say so. The oil just keeps on splattering. Yeah, I can see you have your face shield ready. YOU'LL MAKE IT, RIGHT? You know I care about you, right? I'm always here if you need me. No matter what happens, nothing's gonna change that. It's just that... I've fallen in love with someone else. I just thought you deserved to know. [sniffles] [heavy breathing] Crystal, please. Please. Please. I'm sorry. No! -Please. -No! [sobbing] Come here, please. I'm sorry. Why are you all leaving me? Why do the people I love leave me? [Crystal continues sobbing] [chair clatters] [upbeat music plays] [Tina] Okay! Now group yourselves into three! Three! Bye! Better luck next time! [Karen] Now group yourselves into-- -Hey! -Seph! Seph! I'm sorry but my feet hurt. Seph! Ma'am Tina, excuse me. I'll just get water. [Mico] Me too. No, stay here. I'll bring you some. Wow! Voluntary exit. Well, it's not important who left. What's important is who stayed. I guess we're down to our championship round. All right! Let's do this! Group yourselves into two! Go! ["Mahal Ko O Mahal Ako" by KZ Tandingan playing] # There are two of you In my life # # And now the time has come For me to choose # # I can only choose one of you # # You know I'm always here For you # # Always here for you # # Oh, I love you so much # # But your heart's in a hutch # # And he's always here # # Offering love that won't Disappear # # And now I don't know What to do # # Who should I choose Between the two? # # You who is my dream Come true? # # Or the one who always Comes through? # # Oh, which one should I listen to? # # My restless mind Or yearning heart? # # And now I don't know What to do # [Arvin] What's bothering you? I was just thinking if getting back with Crystal was the right decision. You're both happy, right? I mean, I guess so. It's just like I know that I could feel happier. Does that make sense? I get it. Girl problems. Difficult, right? Right. It's not just a girl. It's Mico. During quarantine, we had a thing. Woah! Really? So, are we still okay or are we awkward now? Bro, I have two moms, remember? And we're friends, come on! It's just that I thought I had everything sorted out. But Arvin, I'm so confused. I mean, I fell in love with a guy. A guy! Can you believe it? Can I believe that you fell in love with a guy? Love is love. That's the only thing you need to believe in. I wish things were that simple. But how? I don't want to hurt Crystal. And of course, there's my parents. I don't want to cause trouble. Either way, somebody's going to get hurt. Xavier, you need to decide. Not just for them, but for you too. What are we doing here? Uhmm... [clears throat] Seph, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls. -[Seph chuckles] -[Kookai laughing] You're crazy. [sighs] I know you can't be mad at me for too long. I'm really sorry, Seph. I'm sorry too. You don't have to apologize. It's my fault. Honestly, I don't know why I can't introduce you to my sister. Maybe I got scared of her expectations of me? And also the standards of an ideal man that I set for myself. But you don't meet those standards. Because you exceed them. ["She" by SAB playing] Did that give you butterflies? Not really. Just hold your pose. Whatever! Come on! Focus on your drawing! You need to get in the Multimedia Arts program, okay? I know you can do this. -Kooks. -Hmm? Thank you for doing this. It's no big deal. Hey, it's a big deal for me. Thank you for the effort. Just treat me food and consider yourself paid. Treat? Okay, I have a surprise for you. Close your eyes. Okay. No peeking. Hold on. Okay, open your eyes. [chuckles] OMG! You're amazing! This is my favorite! You really know how to make me happy. Of course. That's why I always keep some in my bag. I want that flavor too. Don't eat everything in one go. It's so good I can eat this all day. Just the right amount of sweetness. Like us? -Like us. -[Seph laughing] Yummy! [Tina] Hello, everyone! [Kookai] Hi! Class, this is one of the highlights of our writing camp. Because today we will be graced with the presence of Alexander Markova! And for the first time in Philippine history, he will reveal his real identity. -[Tina] Ah-whoa! -[laughing] Everyone, I want you to help me in welcoming Simon dela Cruz. A round of applause! So handsome! -[Simon] So good to see you. -So good to see you too. All right. Okay. Hey, guys! It was just like yesterday, I was sitting right where you guys are today. Six years ago, I was a freshman taking up biology. I didn't expect that I could reach both my dreams of being a future doctor and writer. But here we are. [applause] [Tina] Thank you, Simon! We're excited for our next sessions with you! Mico, careful! Sir dela Cruz. I'm Mico. Call me Simon. Ooh. First name basis. I really like your book, sir. Drop the "sir". Sorry, sir-- I mean, sorry. [chuckles] I really liked your book. Look, my copy is full of annotations. Can I get your autograph? I hope I can write like that in the future. You are so inspiring. Thanks! I remember reading 'Ladlad' by Danton Remoto and thinking to myself that I also want to write for our community. And I think it's really important to get the untold stories of the LGBT community out there. In literature, media... Your ideas about secrets, lies, masks, and other things to reveal one's truth are amazing. Really so amazing! Bro, let's go! Let's get lunch! Wait, Kookai! [chuckles] -I'm buried in sand here. -Oh, sorry! Hi, Crystal! Son of a--! [laughing] Try to look at the white sand so your problems disappear. [Junjun clears throat] Are you okay? You look sad. Random question. How would you know if it's time to let go? I don't know. But it says a lot about how you feel. The fact that you're asking me when it's time to let go rather than why you should still hold on. I think all of us, we deserve a kind of love free from uncertainty. Because in that moment, we are secure. I think I'm just scared to let go. There's nothing to be afraid of. Just listen to your heart and do what it tells you to do. Sometimes, letting go takes more courage than hanging on. Thank you. No problem. Xavier? I'll let you go. Crystal. These past few months have been weird. I thought we were happy. But I was wrong. In fact, we were only hurting each other more. At least we loved each other, right? I still do. But not like before. And I know that you will never break up with me. Because you're a good person. You won't do that to me so... I'm breaking up with you. Again. But this time, I'm sure. [sniffles] I can no longer keep you from your truth. I don't want to stay, knowing I'm keeping you from the person you really love. I'm sorry, Crystal. Please. Stop apologizing. It's time for you to listen to your heart. I'll be fine. [sniffles, sobs] [Xavier] Hey! Wait! Excuse me. Sorry. -Mico. -Xavier. Can I talk to you in private? Sure. After lunch maybe? Mico, it really can't wait. Mico, my man! Let's have lunch together? I'd like to get some of your thoughts on my new book. Sure, game! Game? Okay. How about me? Aren't you going to invite me? Uhm... I'm kidding! I'm just kidding! [chuckles] Kidding. Alright. -Mico, let's go? -Wait. Can you get that for me? Okay, class. So today, we have an activity that can help you build your characters or the voice of your writing. Everybody, stand up! Okay! So, let's look into ourselves because there might be some truths about you that you're unaware of. So we're going to write a word that best describes a person. And we're going to stick it on that person's back. Mico, Xavier is wearing your couple shirt! [shrieks] So, ready your post-its and let's begin! Can I join? -Yes! -Go! Join! [lively music playing] Mico! Can you read the words on my back? Oh! Why? What's this? OMG, Mico! Who wrote 'MINE' on you? It's in red ink. I wish everyone has a blooming love life. [lively music continues] [Kookai] Who's using a red pen? [screaming] # I pray to the heavens You'd accept what I can offer # # I just want to thank you For lighting up my life # # I lived my days sappy But now you make me happy # # Oh, accept the roses And chocolates # Wrong lyrics! # Your life will brighten up When I give you my heart # [cheering] I didn't know you could sing! # Every waking day will be full of bliss # # I will do everything for you, For you my only one # # As long as you're here # My ears hurt. His singing is bad. [laughter] # Because of you, I get more courage # # Because of you I'm never discouraged # # I offer you my love That will never ever cease # # I will do everything for you, For you my only one # # As long as you're here, I am happy forever # [cheering, applause] [all] Cheers! Okay! Next song. Xavier! [cheering, applause] # If only the world belonged to me # [cheering, clapping] # I'll give you everything you ask of me # # Every day I'll make the sun Shine for you # # Every night I'll make the Moon shine so bright # # Only for you # # Only for you # # I will catch all the stars # # Just so my wish could come true # # Oh I wish you were mine # # Your heart and your soul # # If only If only # # If only the world belonged to me # # Everything I'd do # # I'd offer it to you # # I will catch all the stars # # Just so my wish could come true # # Oh I wish you were mine # # Your heart and your soul # # If only If only # # If only the world belonged to me # # Everything I'd do # # Everything I'd do # # Everything I'd do # # I'd offer it to you # [cheering, clapping] You're my idol, Xavier! [chuckles] You're really a singer, huh? Isn't it awkward for Crystal-- We broke up. Crystal and I broke up. [emotive music playing] What's this? You came here just to give me this? Why? I don't need it anymore, Xavier. Mico... Please don't do this to us. Didn't I tell you I just need more time to sort things out? Please, Mico. Things just got more complicated. Until when, Xavier? Please just give me more time and I'll fix this. Until when? Until when, Xavier? For once, please decide. Decide. That's so unfair, Mico. Unfair? And what you're doing to me now is fair? That you expect me to just wait for you? You promised me, Xavier. You promised. I held on to that promise. And it hurts to just wait knowing that you're with her. I still have some respect left for myself. This is enough. Let's just end this. Mico, please don't do this. Please. Please don't give up on us. [emotive music continues] [Mico laughing] "I've never been more sure, Mico." Liar! [laughs] You're so stupid! Mico... [wretching] [coughing] [laughing] So stupid, Mico! [thuds, bottle clatters] [siren wailing] Please... Say something. Mico! Xavier! Shots! Guys, come here! Spin the bottle! Let's go! [indistinct chatter] [screaming, clamoring] Go, Team Xavier! Pull harder! [clamoring] [screaming, cheering] There. "Writer" This is from Lualhati Bautista's book, Sonata. Team Xavier, any guesses on what that word is? Bedroom! "A writer writes best in the bedroom." [Tina laughs] Nice try but you're wrong! Team Mico, if you want to answer, you better win this next round. Ma'am Tina, can't you see their muscles? We're only five. There's six of them! Unfair much! Yes, Ms. Tina! This is unfair. Maybe Simon can join us. Six on six. Okay! Fine! Let's do it! Yeah, bring it! -[Tina] Okay, ready? -We can do this. One, two, three, go! [Tina] Pull! [indistinct chatter] [Tina] Team Mico, don't just stand there! Pull! Don't let go, Mico. Never! [all gasping] Oh my! Are you okay? Mico! -Are you hurt? -Let me go! You didn't have to drop the rope, right? Did you do it on purpose? -Are you okay? -I'm good! Mico, why would I do it on purpose? I don't know, Xavier! I don't know anymore! What the-- is this a gay love triangle? James! You know what James, I've had enough of you! [screaming] Don't touch me! Simon! James, enough! What the hell, Xavier? Guys, chill. I'm okay. Do you really have to hurt everyone around you? Do you like hurting people? Are you enjoying this, Xavier? Fuck! Mico! Mico! Mico! -Mico, please! -Stop, Xavier! Mico, please. Hear me out because I've decided... You've decided? Yes. What if I've decided too? What do you want me to do? Thank you? Be happy because you and Crystal broke up? Mico, please. Enough! We finally have a chance, Mico. Xavier! [sobs] You already did this to me before! You made it look like you chose me. Mico, I did choose you. Until now, I am choosing you. What if you get scared again? You'll leave me hanging again? Do you know how much that hurt? So much! -It hurt so much, Xavier. -Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm here now. I'm sorry. Enough! I've had enough! I'm sorry, Mico. I don't want you to think that my feelings for you weren't real. Mico... If you only knew... All the things I did so my heart would stop wanting you... But it's still you, Mico. It's always been you. I know I caused you so much pain. And it's true, I got scared. Mico, I know I've said it so many times, but I'm sorry that I hurt you. And I know I don't deserve your forgiveness so from now on I'll stop forcing myself on you. Take care, Mico. Xavier... Are you ready for your last season? Do your best! After the camp, be sure to focus on your training. You missed a week. Dad, stop. I'm sorry, mom, dad. But I don't think I can keep pretending that this is what I want to do. Dad, basketball is your dream, not mine. What are you talking about? Is everything okay, honey? I guess not because I want to do something else. Something that will make me happy. Xavier, are you hearing yourself right now? Yes, dad! And for the first time, I want to listen to myself. Xavier, where is this coming from? From Mico. Who's Mico? He's this guy and I'm in love with him. [emotive music playing] Son... Are you gay? Dad, I don't know. Bi? Fluid? I mean... I don't know yet. I'm sorry, Xavier. I don't know what to say. But it's because I don't understand what's happening to you. But we'll talk again soon, okay? I love you, son. Does it hurt? Just a little. Don't worry. How are you? Are you okay? I am. Why wouldn't I be? Look at you. What? I thought you read my book? Look at that mask. The lies. The denial. Too bad because you're cute. You're just saying that. Well... I'm just describing you. And those are all true. Mico... You have to stop this whole charade. We both know who you really want. [clears throat] Sorry. Really. The more we lie, the more we reveal the truth. But Mico, you'll never know 'til you try it out again. I don't know what you went through. But no matter how bad that was, these feelings that you obviously still have for him, could be a sign to maybe try again. To forgive, Mico. [glasses clink] To forgiveness. [soft guitar music playing] [Xavier] I don't think a few lines are enough to sum up everything I've learned here. You know I realized I have a lot of learning and unlearning to do. So, I'll go back to the start. They say we shouldn't be weak. I was so scared to disappoint my girlfriend. Who's now my ex-girlfriend. You know, I had this idea of who I was supposed to be for her. And I tried so hard until I found myself hardly trying. [Xavier sniffles] And in that process, I ended up hurting the first person who taught me how to love. They say we shouldn't take risks. About a year ago, during a time of uncertainty, I met this amazing guy. But slowly, the world reminded me that there were things that just couldn't be. God knows I tried to fight for him. But it wasn't enough. I wasn't able to fight for my feelings for him. But you know, the time that I spent here the past week with all of you guys, it's changed everything for me. Because I learned that it's okay to fail. It's okay to be weak. And lastly, it's okay to take risks in life. What you need is courage to face the challenges that life will throw your way. Thank you. For teaching me how to be courageous. And for helping me find my truth. It may not be with you but, I want you to know that you're always going to be a part of it. [applause] Guys, are you ready? We should be asking you that. -Are you sure about this? -Very sure. There's no turning back! -No way! -No way! Okay then! Let's do this! -Go! -Okay! [all cheering] I think this moment calls for shaggedy shaggedy shapopo. -Game! -Game! Okay, go! One, two, three, go! Shaggedy shaggedy shapopo! [screaming] Let's go! Psst... [screams] Junjun, what the hell? You scared me! What are you? Amapola. From the book. It's from Ricky Lee. Wait. "Reasons why I love you" What's this? Just follow me. Trust me. It's difficult to stand here. Where are you bringing me, sexy monster? Don't call me sexy monster. Where are we going? [soft guitar music playing] [music swells] "You make my heart beat faster" "You make my world stop" "You always bring me milk tea" "Your laugh is infectious" The truth is... Words are not enough to express why I love you. The past months haven't been easy but it was worth it because you taught me how to be strong, how to fight, how to forgive, and how to love again. I'm sorry, Xavier. Mico, I was only waiting for you. I choose you. Final answer? Final answer. So, are we still going to the party? Why not? So are we going as friends? I think we're going as more than friends. Hello, boyfriend.
