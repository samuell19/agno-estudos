You didn't have to stay, you know. - I wanted to. - Well, he'd better have been no trouble. Tea. Ada, it's half past six. Ada. Tea. Where? It's on the table. If you want it, you have to get up and get it. Can't you bring it to me? I know you. You'll fall back to sleep. Nurse Bennett, I order you to bring me that cup of tea, as your superior. Not horizontal, you're not. Wake up, ladies! It's half past six. The sick are on the march. The London is calling. The London is calling! Your colleagues will be pleased to see you. You look well, brother. Your eyes are clearer than I've seen in months. You seem focused and fit. My dearest Edith, God has answered our prayers. You are my god, Henry. I pray to you. I'll fetch your jacket. Nurse Bennett? What are you doing lurking there? Doctors don't lurk, Nurse Bennett. We wait patiently - then strike with surgical precision. - How exciting. - How are you? - All the better for seeing you. Though you don't seem quite as happy to see me. It's not you. It's, er, well, it's...this place. Meaning? No matter how many we cure or patch up, more will always come. Poor Dr Culpin. Perhaps you should change your Christian name from "Millais" to "Mmalaise". Why don't we see if I can't cheer you up this evening? Have you completed the work I set on the lymphatic system? - I stayed up half the night with Gray's Anatomy. - That's not what I asked. I find lymphatics so tedious. Before your brother died, you'd have digested the subject in a week. It's been three now. I know. Ethel, we, each of us, get less from life than we expect, but if you lower your expectations, you will, I guarantee, receive even less than that, and deservedly so. In which case, I shall fully expect to see you this evening. You see Mr Gray this evening. - She doesn't seem to be ill or injured. - Inebriated? She doesn't seem to be. Well, if she's neither drunk, hurt nor sick, then what the bloody hell is she doing here? - Nurse, get this man a sputum mug, will you? - Yes, Matron. - Dr Culpin, where is Sister Russell? - I have no idea. Well, have you had any word from nursing quarters that she's unwell? None. Does she make a habit of being late for work? No, Matron. She doesn't. - Now, if you'll excuse me, I've a patient to attend to. - Yes, of course. Sister Russell! Miss Luckes. - May I have a word with you in your office? - Of course. So, Maude, what is it today? - My chest. - What about it? Pains, Doctor. All over. I know that you are not prone to laziness, so, I expect a reason for you being late this morning. I will not lie to you, Miss Luckes. I overslept. - You've never overslept before. - No. Very well. I've been spending my evenings helping a poor family in lodgings at Wilkes Street, teaching the mother how to maintain hygiene in the home. I've also showed her how to feed her children as nutritiously as she is able on a pauper's budget. And this has kept you up until what hour? It may vary, depending on what time the mother returns home from work. I will often sit up with the children until the early hours. I can scarcely believe my ears. The family needs me. I need you to set an example to your nurses and probationers beneath you. A constant and immaculate example of self discipline. Now, later today, you will assist me in interviewing prospective probationers. We will judge whether they are suitable to join this hospital. I now find myself questioning whether you are fit to sit in such judgement. - The woman was a patient here. - You followed her home. I became aware of her wider needs which I felt in my duty... Your duties are limited to the patients of the London Hospital, within the four walls of the London Hospital. You have no duty to engage in personal projects of your own making. Do I make myself clear? Yes, Matron. I'll see you later... ...assuming you can stay awake. Straight down and left. What in God's name are they? Bulbs. - High voltage? - Progress. - Can I put it down? - Not yet. Perhaps a yucca or, better still, an aspidistra. Excellent, gentlemen. Straight through. - They are going to be wonderful. - The crates or the delivery boys? The contents of the crates carried by the delivery boys. Princess Hatzfeld has given them exclusively to us, Ernest. The deserving poor will derive great relief from them. While the undeserving rich will pay for the cachet of availing themselves of the very latest trend from the continent. It's the perfect outcome for the London. It's like, um... It's like tossing a coin that lands both simultaneously "heads" and "tails". Well, a dry bath sounds pretty rum to me. A hot, dry bath for the treatment of rheumatic gout by electrically heated air is anything but rum, Ernest. I think her jaw might be broken. Um, I am just going to look at your jaw. I am not going to hurt you. I am a doctor, it's fine. Jesus Christ! No man touch! Stop her, will you? - Dr Ingrams? - The creature just bit me! Why was she here? I saw her face, I suspected a broken jaw, went to examine her and the stupid bitch bit me! Let me take a look at your hand. - It's deep. - Yes, I know! On the bright side, I think we can safely say her jaw is not broken. How do you find it, Ernest? Comfortable enough. According to the specifications, a hot air temperature of 170 to 200 degrees can be achieved in five minutes, rising to 300 in 10! Extraordinary! Listen... an ordinary treatment is going to cost us tuppence in electricity. If we charged the poor nothing and those who can pay, one florin, we could potentially net hundreds of pounds a year. At the cost of turning The London into a spa! Nonsense. Everyone who uses the baths will be The London's patients. Heads and tails, Ernest. Heads and tails. Just thought I'd pop my head round the door to say, well, hello! - Hello. - What time are you in theatre? 9.00. Well, old man, break a leg. That won't be necessary. I'm performing a hysterectomy. Excellent. Excellent. Er, better get a clip on. Good to see you back, Henry. And you. And how long have you been coughing up blood? Three months, four. - A lot of the walkers suffer the same. - Walkers? When you lack a home for want of good health, you must take to the streets. Or should you happen to find a bench somewhere and close your eyes, you can depend upon a policeman to rouse you and order you to move along. Or should you find a darkened alley some... - Am I boring you? - Of course not. - An axe embedded in my forehead would be more entertaining? - I'm so sorry. And this will do what? Enable us to see whether or not you have contracted tuberculosis. How? Well, over the next 72 hours, your body will respond to the contents of the injection, and the severity of the response will tell us what we need to know. And if I have tuberculosis, is there a cure? There's a treatment. Come back in three days, Mr Prescott. We'll talk again. In anticipation of the worst when the cough first appeared, I left my wife... ...and my children for fear of infecting them. But walking the streets is breaking me. I need you to make me well, doctor. Please. Come back in three days. Gentlemen, you are about to observe a total hysterectomy with bilateral or unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and the removal of the cervix. If the cancer is advanced, we may well remove the surrounding lymph nodes as well. This technique, known as a radical hysterectomy, was pioneered only recently, it was four years ago. By a Viennese professor of gynaecology by the name of... Somebody? Anybody? Quickly. Before the patient expires. Ernst Wertheim. Creator of the Wertheim hysterectomy. Very good. Have you assisted on such an operation before? I have read about it. Well, then, either you should read what Nurse Bennett is reading, or she should take your place and you, hers. I don't recall saying anything even remotely amusing. Are we ready, Dr Bennett? Yes, we are. Then let us commence with the Pfannenstiel incision. Yes. Come in. Sister Russell. Are you quite prepared? Yes. Their futures do, after all, rest in our hands. Their application forms. They're getting younger. Or am I getting older? Their age remains constant. Ours, alas, does not. We are now through the abdominal wall... ...and the fallopian tubes and the ovaries are clearly visible. The uterus sits just behind the bladder. If I gently move the bladder forward, you can see... Swab. The next stage is... to... ...is to, um... Mr Dean? ...the next stage is to remove the main body of the uterus, the cervix and the upper part of the vagina. More swabs, please. Retractors. I cannot deny my ambition, but in my heart is... ...a great conviction that I can help the sick. In your references, it says you are quick to learn and you relish hard work. Yes. Would you describe nursing as hard work, Miss Lawson? In the sense that all real accomplishment can only be achieved by hard work, then, yes. Miss Lawson, what do you think should bring a nurse the greatest sense of accomplishment, strictly adhering to established codes of practice or following her own instincts about the care a patient may need? Mr Dean. I've cut the ureter. Shall I prepare a suture? Yes. Get me a suture. Quickly. The dedication you spoke of when caring for your mother, could you show that to a complete stranger? - I should like to think so. - An inebriate, who stinks of urine and faeces, uttering one disgusting profanity after another? Well, yes. I would feel sorry, of course, for anyone who found themselves in such condition, but I would set aside such superficialities to attend to the ailing patient beneath. - What about the hours, Miss Riley? - The hours? A nurse must be up at 5.30 in the morning and does not finish until 10.00 at night. If those are the hours I must commit to, then I'd do so gladly. - In bed, lights out, by 10.30. - Yes, of course. You will have to become expert at lifting patients, fitting catheters, changing bedpans. Much of which I was required to do for my mother. And in ten years' time, Miss Riley, as you will be aware, nurses are not permitted to marry. How do you think you will cope with spinsterhood, all your time spent in the company of patients and hospital staff, because the life of a nurse, Miss Riley, is not one that allows romance, - a husband... - Sister Russell. ...or children. Mr Dean? - Mr Dean? - I can't. You have to, the ureter needs... I know what needs to be done! Get help. - And thank you, Miss Luckes. It was a pleasure to meet you. - The pleasure was mutual. Nice girl. Yes. The woman you've been visiting in Wilkes Street. What is her name? Anna. Anna Baker. Did you say how many children she had? I did not. She has five. What ages? From ten months to eight years. The reason I asked Miss Riley if she could transfer what she did for her mother to a complete stranger, was because I wanted to make a distinction between love and care. We do not love our patients, we care for them. And if we fraternise with them outside the hospital, the line between love and care may become blurred. I am always in uniform. Nevertheless, you were in her home, looking after her children. And even if you can maintain the necessary distance, how can you expect Anna and the children to do the same? This is our vocation, Sister Russell. We cannot risk becoming emotionally involved with our patients. When we do, it can cost us more than we can afford to give. When they need us, truly need us they will find a way to us, and we will be here to care for them. And that is how it has to be. Thank you, Matron. Feast your eyes, gentlemen, on the human heart. Down the ages, philosophers and scientists have considered this remarkable muscle to be the seat of thought, reason, emotion, while the Stoics believed it to be the seat of the soul itself. Feast your eyes, gentlemen. You even wash your hands like a doctor. Aren't you going to invite me? I thought we agreed you'd be studying this evening. I've been thinking about that. Thinking is generally considered to be a good thing. I think I want to stop. Every day, I assist surgeons, knowing that my sex precludes me from being one. It precludes me from even taking my place among their students. I look at you. I can never be what you are. - Other hospitals train women to be doctors. - What kind? Shilling doctors? The kind who can be trusted to treat verrucas and coughs? The female kind? Is that truly worth the risk we both run in training me? Ethel, you haven't been yourself since you buried your brother. Freddy had his life stolen from him and I don't want to throw mine away. Is there something else you want to do? You want to be a doctor so much, so...become one! Press on from there. There are other possibilities, Millais. - A doctor's wife? - Why not? Because it would be a criminal waste of your exceptional abilities! Talent is one thing. Opportunity, unfortunately, is quite another. Good night, Millais. Ethel! Madam, we're closed for the day. You're going to have to go home now. If you saw where I lived, you wouldn't call it a home. - Dr Ingrams. You couldn't give us a hand here? - I'm due at my club. She's been sat in the same spot all day and she refuses to move. Dr Culpin? Maude! I told you there's nothing wrong with you! Then why am I getting pains in my chest? Mrs Anderson. Where's Mr Anderson? Maude? Working up at Swan Hunter the past three months. Tyneside? Beautiful new ship for Cunard's. And when was the last time you saw him? The day he left. - How much money do you have? - What? Come on. How much money do you have? I have 12 shillings. - You're not giving her money! - You're right. I'm not. We are, to pay for a trip up north to see her old man. Now, put your hand in your pocket, rich boy. -20 shillings. She'll spend it on drink. - And you weren't going to? Still, champagne's so different to beer. - I think she's telling the truth. - What makes you such a good - judge of character? - Had you pegged from day one, didn't I? Maude, take the train to Newcastle. Go and see your husband. Mwah! Whoo-hoo! Amen. I am clear of cocaine. I swear to you. Even if that is the case, the residual damage to your nerves appears to have rendered you unsafe to operate. "Even if that is the case"? Meaning that you don't believe that I'm clear! Unfortunately, this has moved beyond what we may or may not wish to believe. If my brother says he is clear of cocaine, you must believe him. My dear woman, Henry's word is no longer sufficient. - I am one of the finest surgeons in London! - Then let that be your legacy. And not the needless death of a patient under your knife. I was fetched in time to save the woman this afternoon, but it was far too close. Next time, or the time after that, you mightn't be so lucky. If the London will no longer allow me to practise, then nowhere will. Henry, let me spell this out. You are not safe to practise as a surgeon anywhere ever again! This is what you have wanted all along, isn't it? This is the revenge that mediocrity exacts upon superior talent. For God's sake, man, you nearly killed a woman today! Please, Sydney. One more chance. - Henry, you've contributed brilliantly to your... - Sydney... I am begging you, in the name of my beloved wife and daughter, do not do this to me, I beg of you. I beg of both of you. We've no intention of losing a man of your outstanding gift. The management council would like to offer you a permanent teaching position. Teaching others what I am no longer allowed to do myself? Henry, that's not how it is. Sydney! That is now precisely how it is. You may take it or leave it, Dean. But you have left us with no choice. Souls for bread, is that it? - The bread is not contingent on the prayer. - But prayer comes first. Is it wrong to be reminded that all bounty derives from God, and give thanks? - How long have you been coming here? - Two weeks. - And before that, I worked the slums in Princely Street, New... - Spreading the word... We each do what we can according to our calling, Sister. Nobody pays you to come here. Nobody pays me. I must go. Goodbye. Thank you. If there's anything you need, you have my card. Good night, gentlemen. Terrible, terrible business. We've done the right thing. I don't doubt it for a second. 'The odds will always be against you, Ethel, 'studying to be a doctor.' 'Do you think I should give up my ambition?' - 'Do you?' - 'Never.' Take him to bed, and you're off in a minute. Late shift tonight. You've been a little bit quiet since Elizabeth went. Have I? You don't have to admit everyone who comes knocking, Anna. If you need more food or coal, ask me and I'll see what I can do. I have to take what I'm offered. I can bring everything you need. And when you get bored of bringing it, then what? When you get yourself a chap, you know, yeah, and you got better things to do? - Who helps us then? - That won't happen. You're a good woman, Ada Russell, But I know what this is, even if you don't. What do you mean? - You cradle my baby like a pet cat. - I do no such thing! Like I said, you're kind and you're good to my children. But you knock on my door for your reasons and I let you in for mine. That goes for anyone else offering help. That's just the way it is. The stone steps of the old Nurses' Home are in a very bad way. Several nurses have fallen as a consequence. - Cost to repair? -30 pounds. Fallen, you say? Not merely stumbled? Several have actually fallen. Well, we can't have actually falling nurses, can we? Granted. A request to cover the hot-water pipes in the outpatients' department. - Cost, 110 pounds. - No. A request to put heating in the post mortem department. Cost 60 pounds. Surely heat is the last thing one would want in the post mortem department. - The request comes from the chief pathologist. Granted, and move swiftly. Once again, a request for an extra telephone in the theatre floor. - From? - Mr Dean. How did he take the decision this evening? With great dignity, nevertheless. We need to obtain a loan of 7,500 pounds from the bank to pay the tradesmen's accounts. Agreed. An increase to the salary of Dr Gilbert Scott by five shillings. Taking him to...? Two pounds, six shillings a week. Hardly a great sum. You look at Gilbert Scott and see a deserving young radiographer. I look at him and see the tip of a potentially ruinous iceberg. What time is it? 12:37. ...God! - Details! - Fire. - We'll need boracic baths. - On their way down. Fire, sir. Dr Culpin. I have no idea what it might be, but whatever assistance we can offer... - Much appreciated. Right, let's, er...let's clear a space here. - Where is Sister Russell? Sister, it's a fire. Mr Holland and Mr Morris are at your disposal. For fetching, carrying, lifting. Mr Morris is somewhat squeamish at the sight of bodily fluids, but in all other respects, use us as you see fit. - Screens, please, gentlemen. - Thank you. Where is Nurse Bennett? With all due respect, Matron, this is no time for a roll call. We need to prep for burns, breaks and smoke inhalation. - Which area was the fire up? Two on the floor, side by side. One against the wall. Right away, Matron. - Thank you, gentlemen. We'll box it in. - Yes, Matron. Here they come, ladies and gentlemen. You wouldn't give me a hand, Mr Morris? I'll make the initial assessment as they're coming in. She's dead. Another kiddie, no more than eight years old. Also dead. Sweatshop fire. All children. Set up a makeshift morgue in exam room two. - I'll take care of that. - Thank you, Matron. - I shall need sheets and an apron. - Straight away. He's alive! Morphia! Prepare a boracic bath to soak off his clothes. This will help your burned clothes float free from your skin. It might sting a little, but only because it is working. Right! There's a good boy. Well... Dr Culpin! No. What's your name? Florence. Florence, be brave. Baths. Baths. Nurse Bennett. Sit him down. Doctor! - Mr Prescott. - I was walking in the vicinity. She's alive, Doctor, but only just. - Good to see you Ingrams A sweatshop fire. - I, er... Do what you can...and sober up. Thank you, Mr Prescott. Sir, would you like to sit for a moment? I saw a glow from behind the rooftops, and then I smelled the smoke. There were people running in every direction and shouting. A woman screaming, there were children inside. So I went in. I could feel my eyeballs starting to dry out. But I managed to somehow drag them out. The building was an oven, flaming timber, splitting wood, popping. We were inside a bonfire. It could have been the devil himself. Take small sips. If it were possible, a glass of water. - Matron... - Yes? I believe your skills are more needed with the living. As they come in...would you wrap them as if they were your own... ...as their parents would wrap them? I shall. Very slowly. The bath will help you, Florence. Dr Culpin. Have you inhaled a great deal of smoke? The heat and toxins you have taken in may have damaged your airway. Take deep breaths. Would you prefer to lie down? Fetch a chair. I used to box for my university. I once saw a fellow come out of the ring perfectly compos mentis only to collapse an hour later. He died. Is Mr Fenwick on his way in? - He refuses to have a telephone at home. - Any other surgeons expected? Messages have been left, but none live local. Where is the pain? - In the side? - Yeah. Let's take a look at you. Fetch me a stethoscope, please. Take a deep, slow breath. Swelling. Just who I needed. - Nurse Bennett requests the use of a stethoscope. - Give it to her. Come straight back, please. - Tracheotomy kit. - Yes, doctor. The ancients used to drill holes in skulls to free evil spirits. We do it to alleviate the pressure from haemorrhage. Progress. - Now, I saw this once during training. - I see. I was, however, standing at the back. We were a large group of medical students. Hold his head, please, and firmly. We don't want it slipping off the end of the drill. Lean forward, please. Don't move. - Dr Culpin, I think we have a tension pneumothorax. - Why? The patient is struggling for breath. The respiration is deteriorating. There is an - absence of audible breath sounds. - Which indicates? The lung is not properly unfolded in the pleural cavity. - Have you percussed the chest? - I did and I got hyperresonance. - You sure? - I think so. Do you think or do you know? There's a sign of a broken rib, possibly two. One of the fractured ends may have inverted into the lung. - Do you know the procedure? - I know, but I'm not qualified to do it. - Do you know the procedure? If you know it, do it. - Dr Culpin... Do it, Ethel. If it is a tension pneumothorax, you haven't much time. - You've got it. - Swab, please. Thank you. - Dr Ingrams... - Not now. Have the tracheotomy tube ready. Ada! Anna? The boys are safe but Peggy's missing. - We heard that children were being taken to the London. - Yes. To the morgue. How many more are in there? Five. Excuse me, Matron. The first rib can't normally be felt. The second rib can be felt just below the collarbone. The second intercostal space is the area in between the second and third rib. Dr Culpin. All right. Let's... let's get her over here. - Peggy! - Anna, wait! - Peggy! - Wait. You have to stay here, Anna. She's Anna's. What should I tell her? I need glycerine and borax to clear the airway. Identify second rib and the second intercostal space and the mid clavicular line in the centre of the collarbone. Needle. Insert the needle over the third rib, through the intercostal space, and into the chest cavity. A small prayer might not go, at this point, unanswered. - Nurse Bennett, what are you doing? - A needle thoracentesis. None of the doctors were available. Nurse Bennett, what do you think you're doing? - Sorry, Matron. What was the question? - Stethoscope. Hold that there, please. You did it. Good. Keep an eye on him. You may need to repeat. Nurse, your top button is undone. - Yes, Matron. - Miss Luckes... Drink this. Miss Luckes, in the midst of all this, does it honestly matter that the button is undone? Yes. I think it matters very much, Doctor. It is a matter of discipline. Nurse Bennett, would you come with me, please? - Yes, Miss Luckes. - Ethel, stay there. - A doctor does not call a nurse by her Christian name. - Stay where you are! And attend to your patient. - A nurse does not have a patient, doctor. - You have my pity, Miss Luckes. All round you the flames of modernity are blazing as fiercely as the fire that tore through the slum, yet there you stand, trying to keep everything right in its bloody place. With buttons and all. Dr Culpin, where did Nurse Bennett learn to do a needle thoracentesis? It is not in any of the nursing manuals. - It is to her credit if she reads widely. - Dr Culpin! Not if it interferes with her true vocation. In any other London hospital, she could train as a doctor. This hospital believes the profession is not suitable for women. Meaning, you are not suited to the profession. - Dr Culpin! - How dare you? How dare you impose your own limitations on the aspirations of others? I don't doubt you're a great force for good, Miss Luckes, but for progress, not at all! Progress is not always for the best. That rather depends upon how far ahead one chooses to look. Dr Culpin! She's going. Do something. Do something. Peggy! I'm sorry. No! No! Peggy! If you'd find Dr Culpin and ask him to join us. Form a line... Form two lines over here, wouldn't you? Start to line up... Shh, shh, shh. I thought I'd find you breathing the wards. In all my years at this hospital, Sydney, I have never been spoken to like that. It was very late, the end of a long and gruelling night. When you came to the London, you were faced with a nursing system that was inefficient, inadequate and unorganised. There was a blight over everything. One operating theatre with only one table, for goodness' sake, a wooden affair that, frankly, wouldn't have been out of place in a butcher's shop. Nobody knew that you'd become one of the ablest, most remarkable women of the age. You transformed this hospital. We've seen a few fiery young doctors in our time, all of them eager to malign the status quo, which is their right, if not their duty. But...you and I know what came before. You and I know how far the London has come, because, you and I dragged it out of decrepitude, inch by, forgive me, bloody inch. You don't regret me asking you to come here, do you, Sydney? My dear Eva, I refuse to dignify that question with a response. May I walk the wards with you? Yes. Yes. I should like that very much indeed.
