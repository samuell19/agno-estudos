Together, we’re invincible! Together, fighting oppression! Together, we’re invincible! Together, fighting oppression! Together, we’re invincible! Together, fighting oppression! Together, we’re invincible! The boss can afford so many guards... but can’t give his workers a decent pay? Security guards are just like us. They’re workers, too. Let’s not clash with them. Together, we’re invincible! Stop! We want to go in! And talk to the factory’s owner! Let us in, or we’ll use force. Open the gate! STOP! STOP! Enough! I said, enough. Enough! Shithead! STOP! Send someone in to talk to me. The one on the right, stay out. How? You both go in. Tell him what we have agreed on. You can count on us. Under one condition. The rest of you, go home! NO WAY! You think I’m crazy? I won’t harm your two friends. Hey, out of the way! Move. Go home. My friend said you’re a troublemaker, leading the protests. I’m just fighting for my rights. And my friends’ My friend’s father doesn’t mind the small pay, as long as he has a job. Just because others won’t stand up for their rights... Doesn’t mean we have to be like them. But why? If we see injustice before our eyes and do nothing then we’re no longer humans. Thank you for fixing the light. Sancaka, won’t you close the window? But it’s raining outside, Mom. Lightning won’t strike you. Hurry, close the window. Our two friends have been missing for three days. The guys are angry. They want to go into the factory. Both of them haven’t come home for three days? Maybe they’re already dead. I’m going. Take care of Sancaka. All right. Be safe. Where’s Dad going? Remember the two workers who went inside the factory? They never returned home since. Your dad and the workers are going to the factory. Let’s go to the missing workers’ houses. To make sure their families are okay. We’re here to check on you. I’m fine, really. Hang in there. - How much? - What? How much did they pay you to betray your own friends? We need the money. Pathetic! Mom! ARE YOU AFRAID? NO! YOU GUYS READY TO DIE? NO! Mom! Mom! YOU GUYS READY TO DIE? YES! Mom! Mom! Mom! Sancaka, go to the factory now! Tell Dad they’re being set up. Go, Sancaka! Your father’s in danger. ARE YOU AFRAID? NO! YOU GUYS READY TO DIE? YES! ARE YOU AFRAID? NO! YOU GUYS READY TO DIE? YES! DAD! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! We don’t carry knives. Dad. Dad. Dad. Please don’t die, Dad. Dad. Please don’t die, Dad. Wake up, Dad. Help him! Sancaka. I have to go out of town tomorrow. Someone offered me a job. Overnight? Yes, just for one day. It’s been a year since your father died. We’ve sold this house. We’re renting now. I’m running out of money. I have to earn more. Just for a day, right? Yes. Day after tomorrow, after school, I’ll be right here, cooking for you. You’re a brave boy, right? Don’t play outside. It’s rainy season. You don’t want to get struck by lightning and get sick again. Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... I brought you some food. GET HIM! SHITHEAD! YOU WANNA DIE? You got short legs, pig! PARDON ME! GET HIM! SHITHEAD! What did you do to piss them off? They were harassing a girl. A street busker like me. So I threw a rock at them. Learn to mind your own business. If you stick your nose in other people’s business, you’ll have a shitty life. Then why did you help me? Well, that’s why I got problem now. I could take five of them, no problem. But if the whole gang goes after me, I’m dead. Sorry I got you in trouble. I’m Awang. Sancaka. Eat. Then I’ll teach you how to fight. Why? So you can defend yourself, and no longer my problem. Have you ever had a home? Yes. Once. Some rich folks adopted me. But they abused me. I ran away. Don’t trust rich people. Many of them are bad. I almost died. Are you scared of the rain? I’m scared of lightning. Why? It’s always after me. You have a problem with lightning? Did you stick your nose in its business, too? Once a year, there’s a train passing by here. It goes on, non-stop, for a week. Where to? Southeast. The safest place. When is it passing by here again? Tomorrow. I’ll hop on that train and get out of here. Non-stop for a week? What will you eat? There’s food in the cars. Vegetables. Fruits. Can I come? No. You’re not my problem. I won’t be any trouble. You’re already trouble as you are. Mom? Sancaka. Mom, I missed you so much. Don’t ever go away again, please. Sure you want to come with me? Yes. Now. Awang! Sancaka, let’s go! Awang! Come on, Sancaka! Awang! Quick, you can do it! Awang! Come on, Sancaka! You can do it! Awang! Sancaka! Awang! Don’t trust anybody! Stay out of other people’s business! You’ll survive. Hey! I stay out of your business. You stay out of mine. Help! Fucking immigrant! You’re just messing up my city! Hey! [A group of boys yelling after Sancaka] Get in the car! Hurry up! Why are they after you? Who are they? Where do you live? Let us take you home. Can you speak? Do you have a home? Parents? Where should we take him? Your choice. We can drop you off at the police station or come with us. Live with us. Be our son. We’ll put you in school. Get you smart. What do you want to be? An engineer? An artist? A scientist? So, how, honey? Don’t be scared. We just want to help you. Hey, boy! You should be a technician. You got more skills than the real technicians. But if you’re a technician, you’ll be unemployed soon. Being a security guard is better. They still need you. This was a roof tile factory, now it’s a printing house. They always need a security guard. Dry rain. Pouring heat. Everything is mixed up! The fan is dead. Our conscience is dead! [People yelling and looting] There are countless reasons for hate in this country. Countless differences! Shut the fuck up! Please. Please! Let’s see what you’ve got. Nothing. Just some clothes. Give me everything! Please. This is all I have. Just give me everything! Clothes. Just let it go! Are these all legislators? Yes. These are my colleagues. Why aren’t there any children with them? Your father is the youngest legislator. The others have children, but they’re all grown up. Dirga Utama. The hot shot young politician. Rahayu. Sadha. Sasha. Hello. Hello. I’m getting some food with the kids. Yes. Say bye-bye. Bye. How does it feel to be a young politician? I’ve forgotten all about it. We both just took our oath this morning. Still optimistic, I bet. Ferry doesn’t speak for all of us. I still have high hopes. Hopes? What can you expect from people’s representatives who are under that mafia boss’ payroll? The man has a dodgy background, but we worship him. I heard rumors. His father owned the largest plantation in Java. Once, the workers demanded less work hours, but he didn’t agree. Are you with me? We demand more decent work hours, and higher pay! Agree! We demand a decent break time. Agree! We have to make our point today! Agree! A plantation worker had an affair with another worker’s wife, then killed the husband. [Woman screaming hysterically] [Two men shouting and fighting] [Woman screaming and crying hysterically] Then he framed Pengkor’s father. [Men shouting] [Woman screaming and crying hysterically] It still doesn’t explain why we have to kiss his ass. I’d rather go than shake hands with him. Dirga Utama. Our youngest legislative member. I know who you are. Haidar Subandi. Sorry, but I don’tt shake hands with someone like you. Just call me Pengkor. I’m nobody. Just a citizen who wants to meet my representatives. I know you’ve got young blood. But this is not being smart. If not associating with the mob is not being smart... won’t mind being the biggest fool. It’s him against so many of us. Why should we be scared? When he was a kid, his uncle put him in a notorious orphanage. Run by ruthless people. Left him there to die. So the inheritance would go to his uncle. Many orphans there died, or were sold, or forced to work hard. Pengkor organized the orphans and planned an uprising. It wasn’t long before Pengkor got hold of his father’s assets. Some say, he put the orphans through school, to be whatever they wanted to be. And they became his soldiers, always at his service. Now, Pengkor has hundreds of orphanages across the country. He’s not a mafia. To some, he’s a god. I didn’t go to school for two days, then two girls gave me a note. Oh my God! We miss you, Sadha! Oh it’s so romantic. You’re too young to date, you know. I didn’t ask to be so dashing. What’s wrong, honey? Nothing. Sure? Tired. I’m just tired. Why is the street so quiet? [Street busker singing] Excuse me. Mom, can I give him some money? Do you have money with you? Sir, excuse me. Honey, don’t get too close to the window. Why did you give him money? It’s fine. You’re not supposed to. We still have a lot of money over the fridge. Yes! So? [Kids joking around] Are you sure you’re okay? I’m fine. Who’ve been watching violent movies? Yes you did. I only watch animation movies. Belle. Beauty and the Beast? Beauty and the Beast. Honey, what’s wrong? It’s nothing. Get inside. Lock the door. (In Javanese) Sleep... [Dirga Utama’s family crying for help] Sadha! Sasha! What did I do to deserve such humiliation? I always do good deeds as a citizen. I always help those in need. Please. Let my family go! I have to set an example. A people’s representative who doesn’t respect the people. Please, no. Please. Please, no. I’m begging you! Let my family go. Please. Let them go. I’m begging you. But have you learned anything from this? A representative for the people doesn’t need hands. Only mouth, to speak up. Please! [Kids screaming] [Rahayu screaming] You can also use your mouth to save your family. Please, I’m begging you! Let my family go. Please! Let them go. Please! [Rahayu and the kids screaming] [Dirga screaming] No! Before he died, he got your message. What’s the use, then, if he dies? You know why I don’t fear death? Because I know what’s in store after you die. Maybe our soul and our memories keep on living. I want to make sure his soul lives on in eternal regret. [A group of men grunting] [Sancaka panting] Come out! Don’t make me break the door! Come out and we’ll talk. You’re lucky to be able to live in this city. Always remember that. Come out! Come out! [Man yells] Who are you? Where’s your mother? I checked. She’s not here. Tell your mother, we’ll be back! Next week, i will get money from the man who will buy my apartement. Good, because if you don’t give me money by next week, I’ll go alone. Nothing to expect here in Jakarta. We’ll spend the rest of our lives going nowhere. This country will soon implode from people killing each other. You’ll see. [Someone banging on the door] You’re a pickpocket, aren’t you? Yes! [The mob shouting] Please, let me in. Or else, I’ll die! Like I care! What’s wrong with you? Get in. But he’s a pickpocket! So you’ll let the mob beat him up and burn him to death? [The mob shouting] Get on! You want to survive? Go to the police station! Get on! You, too! Just get on! Open the door! Living is no use if you stop caring. And only think about yourself. [The mob shouting] Hey! Open the door! I know you’re in there! Get out! [Door slams open] I’m not scared of you! What do you want? Do you get a kick out of this? What did you say back at the market? You want me to kill your boy? Fuck you! Motherfucker! Don’t you dare! Hands off! Tough guy! Come on! Finish him! Get in! None of your fucking business! Awesome. Totally. Lift him up! What’s wrong with his ear? It was cut Let me cut the other one so they’re equal. [Sancaka screams] Stop! Enough! Enough! Let’s go! Go home! Enough! Let’s go! Enough, enough! One, two, three! Might as well. Come here! Let’s get out of here! [Thunder strikes] [Sancaka panting] [Sancaka screams in pain] Mom, I miss you. Mom. Mom. Mommy. Mommy. [Someone knocking on the door] [Someone knocking on the door] [Someone knocking on the door] [Someone knocking on the door] [Someone knocking on the door] Watch over Teddy for me. Hey! In a less crazy world, Pengkor would’ve been arrested and gone to jail. I told Dirga to speak more carefully. I have to say the same thing to you. Because I care. These people that Pengkor pays, they never scare me. People gossiping. Might lead to false accusations. It’s better to report it to the Honorary Council, if you have evidence. Believe me, I will get that evidence soon. Or you can ask him directly. The one you think has been paying me and the other legislators. That’s what I thought. I’m just here to offer my condolences. It’s such a loss. A young and dedicated legislator like him. Thank you, esteemed people representatives. I’m repulsed at myself... For letting him come in here and threaten us. Maybe he really just wanted to pay a visit. I heard some unpleasant news about the market. I made you a legislative member because I thought you could control your area. I’ll take care of everything, sir. If people in an area can act without rules, other areas might do the same. That’s unacceptable. Understood, sir. Now go back to work. I don’t believe they will do what we say. Won’t be long now, they will have no choice. The car is going backward! [People yelling in panic] How long have you been here? Two weeks. Where’s your mother? She died. So that wasn’t your mother? Don’t let her find out you thought she was a mother. She’s my sister. Wulan. Sedhah Esti Wulan. What are you listening to? Nothing. In your headphone? It’s broken. Why are you wearing it? So people won’t talk to me. [Music in headphone] Thank you. I have to go to work. You wait here. No one will stand up for us but ourselves. We have to guard the market 24 hours a day! That’s right! Who will fight for us? Ourselves! Come on, people! Who will stand up against the thugs? Why did you bring him here? It’s not safe. I have to work. Has he eaten? Didn’t you feed him? No food at my place. Well, can’t you buy some? Help! They’re coming! They’re coming! Help! They’re coming! They’re coming! [The crowd gets intense] They’re coming! [People approaching] You’re not dead yet? Damn, you just won’t learn your lesson. Please don’t fight here! You’re destroying my stuffs! [Men shouting and chasing] [Thunder strikes] Go ahead! Go get him! [Man on the floor, moaning in pain] So you fought 30 market thugs? That’s right. 30. Were they kid thugs? Grown men. Were they handicapped? No. I don’t know how I fought them, either. Were they old ladies? Chill, why so serious? Here. But why are you black and blue? When I was fighting, my power went back to normal. Was it ever... not normal? If it was normal, I couldn’t have possibly beat 30 people. No, you have to come with us to the market! I shouldn’t have been there. Thank God you were there. Otherwise, there’d be nothing left of the market. So he really fought many thugs? 30. And they might come back. More of them. So you have to help us. I’m not a hero. And I don’t know how I managed to fight them. Because you are strong. You had bruises. Now they’re gone. Yes, they’re gone. No more wounds. Ouch! Nemo! You didn’t seem to feel any pain before. I’ve been trying to say. I’m not as strong as you think. Are you okay? He’s faking it. He just doesn’t want to help us. I told you, I’m not a hero. Come on. Let’s keep an eye on the market, instead. You really passed out earlier? Now you believe that I fought 30 thugs? They said they saw it themselves. So, if I just tell you, you won’t believe me? Hey! Just making sure. Don’t come in! Don’t come in! It’s dangerous! Stay here with me. Calm down. No one wants to help them. Even if I’d gotten here earlier last night, I wouldn’t have been able to prevent this. You don’t get it. These people didn’t have any hope before. Yesterday, suddenly they have hopes. Because you came. That’s all they need. If we refuse to fight injustice in before our eyes... It means we’ve lost our humanity. What do we do now? These thugs are just pawns. Their boss is Ganda Hamdan. A member of House of Representatives? Yes, also a boss to the thugs. All his life. We have to ask him to pay for the damages. Why don’t we go to the police? Can the police pay for our damages? Are you going? I don’t know. Maybe I’ll just deal with the problems at the market. Sir. Attack me. What? Jump, and kick me. Why? Take a step back. Come on. Come on. Kick me! Jump and kick me! Come on! Come on! Does it hurt? I’m too old for this shit. I’m sorry. Someone jumped at me at the market, and I became strong. Maybe it’s something you ate? I didn’t eat anything. Maybe that’s why. You became strong from starving. No reason to get scared of lightning. Tell me, why are you scared? Getting struck by lightning hurts. Thunder can shatter glass, or other things that resonate with its frequency. How come you’re so smart? I read. I think it worked. You’re this is the right area? I came here seven years ago. His house was surrounded by vacant lots. But this is the right way? Yes. See that tent? Make a left. That’s him! Hey, what are you all doing here? We’re here to see Ganda Hamdan. You can talk to us. What do you want? We have no business with you. We want to see Ganda Hamdan. Mr. Hamdan’s business is our business. Tell me what you want. What’s going on here? Disturbing my wedding. Go back in. Stay out of this. What the hell do you mean? I’ve been waiting ten years to get married. And now you tell me to stay away? Are you paying for this tent? Tell me what’s going on. Some people here burned down the market. We’re vendors. Everything is toast. Come here. I said, come here! What’s going on. I told you to stop making trouble. What are you talking about? Look me in the eye. Tell me you and your friends didn’t burn down the market. We didn’t... DON’T LIE TO ME! No, honey. I’m not lying to you. I wouldn’t dare lie to you. I don’t want to die. OH MY GOD! Help. Help! What’s wrong? Help! Honey? Honey! Call an ambulance! ’PREGNANT WOMEN GOT SICK FROM CONTAMINATED RICE’ ’SURVEILLANCE CAMERA FOOTAGE’ A serum that corrupts morality? To put it simply. Here’s the scientific explanation. The serum is injected into rice, and it will corrupt a fetus’ brain. Making them unable to differentiate the good from the bad. And what’s the effect? A whole generation, born from mothers who consumed the contaminated rice will be an immoral generation. Protests are happening across the nation, demanding the government’s responsibility for the contamination of the rice stock. Attacks are intensifying on shops that still sell the rice from the national rice supply. The news about this moral-corrupting substance is a hoax. Nothing but public hysteria. More and more looting in many cities. Police forces are sent to guard several areas. But looting keeps happening in unguarded areas. Who are you? Trying to join us? Too many of us already. Why did you kick me, man? I’m not good at talking. Sancaka, don’t worry. They said it will rain tonight. So you don’t have to get black and blue. Yes. Mr. Agung said you’re moving southeast? Yes. I moved there couple years ago. Why did you come back here? Just to get Teddy. He was living with my stepfather here. Then I saw how the market vendors needed help. I couldn’t just leave them. Mr. Agung also told me about your mother. Mr. Agung always talks too much. He said you still keep her picture in your wallet. What’s wrong? Nothing. She’s so pretty. She abandoned me. Wait here. What are you looking for? If I have something on my ears, I won’t feel pain. Like an antenna? Like an antenna. What do you think? I’m ashamed to be Indonesian. What are you up to? I have to make something. So that you, Teddy, and Wulan won’t get electrocuted when touching me. Let them take everything. As long as we’re safe. No, I won’t let them. Over my dead body. Wealth is not always in my family line. But there’s always this one thing passed down the generations. The most precious thing. Rich or poor, we are a family of survivors. Because we know who to be loyal to. That’s what I like about you, Ganda. Because you know who to be loyal to. What’s this, sir? Something that will help us defeat an emerging enemy. Everybody wants to welcome him. Quiet! Quiet! I think it’s a hoax. His movement looks computer-generated. I don’t care. Hoax or not, this lifts up my spirit. Better than the government. They don’t care about the people. So, the House of Peace really exists? Where like-minded politicans, police officers, and media owners get together. You tell one person, tomorrow you’ll disappear. Right, of course, Sir. We have to synergize and do something. The nation is in emergency. Pengkor might be behind the rice contamination issue. But we can’t come to a conclusion until we arrest the culprit. So, what’s the main objective? It’s obvious. To make a whole generation immoral. Define immoral. Those who watch porn? LGBT? Does immoral include corruption? If it does, then I’m worried. Maybe there’s a solution to this problem. I know a drug company... ...that can neutralize the substance consumed by pregnant women. Through injection. But the government needs to legalize it first. Let those babies be born without morals. What is “morals”? What matters is logic and conscience. That’s it. Whatever it is, we need something to calm the people down. Right? We have to act fast, and pass it as a law. So, all pregnant women are obliged to have the injection. So we have to lobby other House of People’s Representatives members. Pengkor won’t be happy. We also have to unite against that. Do a background check on the pharmaceutical company. Right away, Sir You heard about the guy who fights the looters, right? We have to find out who he is. We might need his help. All right, sir. I’ll find out. Don’t ask her why she cooks. She’ll be embarrassed. Why? I think she has a crush on you. Why are you wearing a skirt? What’s wrong with wearing a skirt? I can wear whatever I want. Fine. I’ll go change. What are you doing back here? Burning the whole market is not enough? You want to kill me? Try. I’m not afraid! You want to know who burned down the market, right? I have information. Hey. Come here! Hurry! Spill! So here’s the thing. Before I was a thug at the market, I was a parking guy. At malls, office buildings, even luxury apartments. So what? I was working at this apartment building. One of the tenants there was Adi Sulaiman. He’s a famous violin player. Yes, I know. But what’s this got to do with him? That’s the thing. What was he doing at the market, at night? Are you sure it was him? I’m sure. People just didn’t realize it. The vendors just kept pointing fingers at us. They’re nobody, just like us. Why is the star the last to go home? Been counting money from tickets? We’ll see you later. Why did you burn down the market? What do you mean? I’ll ask once again. You’d better answer me. Or I’ll break your arm. You’ll never play music again. Please, no. I was told there will be a hero wannabe. I just didn’t think he would look this stupid. We have to save our children! Our next generation has to have morals! Legislators must legalize the moral serum antidote. Right now! Legalize! Legalize! Legalize! Good morning. With all due respect, sir. This part of the building is for People’s Representives only. I am the people. My representatives can be here, but I can’t? How can I help you? I just want my aspirations to be heard. I think distributing drugs to the people for something that’s not yet proven... ...is a waste of people’s money. So, you think we should wait until it’s proven? Wait until the children are born, with no ability to differentiate the good from the bad? Is that it? You’re underestimating the human mind. I have no time for debate. I have an assembly to attend. Excuse me. He must’ve said the same thing to other members. I hope some of us are still brave enough. An assembly could take a long time. But we don’t have much time. I hope my fellow legislators can put their political differences aside... I’m not sure those politicians are willing to put their differences aside... ...even when it concerns the nation’s future. Even if they are, they’d have to face Pengkor. Who is he? A mafia boss with his claws on the House of Representatives. When I first met him, he was four years old. I found him among the ruins of a red-light district, destroyed by an angry mob. His mother was a hooker, been dead for three days. Those people with “morals” didn’t care to save an innocent child. He never cried. I raised him to become a musician. You know, every time you hear him play his music, ...you’ll hear his heart cry. Who did this? Someone who thinks he’s a hero. A lone wolf. One person who will be followed by many. Now it’s time for the orphans to rise. And act together. I love the way you contradict softness with cruelty That’s a misperception. Softness does not contradict cruelty. ‘FATHER’ ‘FATHER’ ‘FATHER’ ‘FATHER’ ‘FATHER’ ‘FATHER’ ‘FATHER’ ‘FATHER’ Tomorrow, I only need one of you to come with me. No, Mr. Ridwan. It’s very dangerous these days. Get in. Get in! We have been looking for you. This looks familiar. The same tattoo as the guy who burned down the market. I thought that was just hearsay. Pengkor’s orphans, trained to become assassins. How many are they? Thousands. All across the country. We need your help. For the sake of the nation. Who are you? The people. Hey! You’d better go home. You want to end up in the gutter? Go home! What disappoints me, Ganda... Even in peaceful times, museums in this country are more quiet than graveyards at night. Let alone in turbulent times like now. While museums are the most honest form of history, more than books. Do you understand ancient Javanese, Ganda? I’m afraid I don’t, Sir. It reads: “The most dangerous foe of men.” What does it mean? Do you know? No, sir. The hidden truth. That is mankind’s most dangerous enemy. A great storm is coming. There will be a change in power. I need to know that you are ready to accept and adapt with the changes. Of course, sir. Good. Riots are still happening across the nation. But, citizens start to unite and work together... ...to stop acts of looting. Meanwhile, protests to push the distribution of the moral serum are intensifying. Thousands of people gather at the Parliament. Demanding legislators to pass the law... ...obliging all pregnant women to get injected. We have to be more clear-headed. We can’t let the panic happening outside to get to us here. Interruption, Your Honor. This drug will only lead to even bigger panic. The supply might not be enough for all of our provinces. There will certainly be sentiments of inequality among the people. Interruption, Your Honor. I second that opinion. It’s best to wait until we have a thorough research... ...about the effect of the incident in the rice supply storage. Interruption. I won’t pretend to be a saint. I was also a crook. A fraud. I cheated my way to get to where I am now. But now, a whole generation is on the line. It might be your children. Or ours. Or yours, Your Honor. I believe this is a chance for me, for all of us, to redeem our past mistakes. Let’s prove that we still have a conscience. Permission to speak, Your Honor. I don’t have children. But if I did, I wouldn’t want them to be immoral. Because there will never be a generation to correct my past mistakes. Many of our peers died... ...fighting for an upcoming generation. The peers whose political vision couldn’t be more different than mine. But I am sure they’ll all go to heaven. And I want to go to heaven. So, I vote to legalize the immoral serum antidote. The antidote is legalized! To save time, the distribution of the antidote will begin today for the capital area. It will continue to other regions, where the serum will be given to those in need. The news says we are entering the dry season. How are you doing? I’m all right. It’s safe now. Teddy. Teddy, can you leave us alone? What’s wrong? Sancaka. In the southeast, I was a nurse at a hospital. I knew your mother. She went home, Sancaka. She went to find you after you left. For weeks, she waited for you at home. She looked for you in orphanages and everywhere. She talked about you every day. It’s one of the reasons why I went to get Teddy. Because he’s the only family that I have left. Was she also a nurse? She was a patient. She was sick. The doctor said she didn’t have much time. Is she still in hospital? She refused to spend her last days in a hospital. Congratulations, Dad. ‘FOR RIDWAN BAHRI’ I sent you photo of a lab report. What does it say? Hello? Hello? Yes, sir? All distributions of the immoral serum antidote must be stopped. Sir, for security reasons, there’s only one person that knows the drivers’ phone numbers. And I just found out who owns the company that produces the immoral serum antidote. Who? A subsidiary of Pengkor’s company. Have you tracked down our hero? Working on it, sir. Find him! And call every single drug pick-up point! Stop the injections! Will you come back here once you find her? I don’t know. I don’t know how long it will take to find my mother. The country is safe now. I’m no longer needed here. All my life, the one thing that never lasts long is peace. Sir, I found a number. Our hero might be there. Send it to me. Now! All right, sir. I hope I’m speaking to the right person. There is no immoral serum. It’s just something Pengkor made up, to make us distribute the drug. The drug will make babies born with defects. Ridwan Bahri? You have to find Pengkor now. He’s the only one that can stop the drug distribution! I have to go find Pengkor. SANCAKA! Wait here. Sancaka, you’re still weak. Don’t worry. I’ll be fine. You all wait here. There are many rules in the world. Skies are blue, oceans are blue, forests are green. What I don’t agree is, greater power comes with... ...bigger bones to pick. But, like all bones, they can be snapped easily. What’s dangerous is the symbol for hope. For the people, hope is an addiction. And addictions are dangerous. Get out of the way! Attention, please! Please, maintain order. Understand? Let go! Stop! Bro! They instructed to stop the drug’s distribution. Why? I don’t know... Sir, we’re late, so our wives are at the back of the line. Please, help my wives. These are the names of our wives. Please help us out. Come. Stop! Or they die. I was wrong. You’re not a bone. Let alone hope. You’re just a small pebble on the road. Your story ends here. It won’t take long. I’m not a sadist. Finish them. Wait! Wait! Don’t! Please! Sancaka! What you need can only be found within you. (In Javanese) Sleep... Sancaka. I’m sorry we abandoned you. But we’re here now. Sancaka! Sancaka! Sancaka! Sancaka! Father is dead. [Thunder strikes] FATHER! Leave, now! Go! There never was an immoral serum. You sent your people to contaminate the rice and you get them caught on camera to cause panic. I united the people and their representatives. In the history of this nation, I’m the only one who can do that. You should be thanking me. You want all children to be like you? Angry at the world? I’ve always been grateful about how I am. Besides, I never made this happen. I even tried to stop it from happening. I gave you, the people and their representatives, a choice. You made a decision. It’s a beautiful irony. I have to stop all this. Impossible. My masterpiece has started. When these babies are born, The people will blame and kill each other. And every time they can forget, they will see children like me. And they will kill each other again. People are not as foolish as you think. The people has to stay foolish, if you want the world to be at peace. I’ll set them free from people like you. Want to bet? I didn’t understand. What happened to the sword? My lightning makes thunder. Anything at the same frequency with things I hold will be destroyed. Where can I find the serum? Some arestill on the way. Let me take you. Please get more serum. Please! Stop! Stop! Out of the way! Hold this. Thank you. Let me guess. The bottles are made of similar glass material you always have with you, right? I’m not stupid, you know. Don’t be too smart. You will be no use for me. Stop! Out of the way! [Shawl striking] Can you guess, too? That the glass material in front of you is the same as the glass I always carry with me. I still have to destroy that, too? You can’t. There’s only one person who can. Thank God we haven’t had the shot. Honey! Head of a legend. Blood of a hero. (Ancient Javanese) Who are you standing before me? (Ancient Javanese) I’m Ghazul. (Ancient Javanese) At your service, Ki Wilawuk. (Ancient Javanese) Your enemy has arrived. (Ancient Javanese) Which one? Gundala. (Ancient Javanese) But he hasn’t known who he is. (Ancient Javanese) Prepare the army. (Ancient Javanese) The great war is approaching. It’s better than being a market thug. Going around, bullying people for money. It’s exhausting! Easier this way to make money. And we look good, too. Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma’am. Ma’am. Wait. Yes, sorry! Sorry! Thank you. I heard you were leaving? I’m not going anywhere. The situation is peaceful now. You can go if you want. Someone said to me, the one thing that never lasts long is peace. So why do you think we fight for it? It won’t last anyway. Because every second of it is worth fighting for. Thanks for the costume. It’s not from me. It’s from the people. He will need your help, Sri Asih. Ready?
