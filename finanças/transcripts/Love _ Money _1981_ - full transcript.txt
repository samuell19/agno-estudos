[**] [BLOWS WHISTLE] I need a tailor, darling. You're losing weight. Eat your Cream of Wheat. I'm shrinking. Only my feet are getting bigger. Good morning. Morning. Do it while you're young. Do what? Whatever you're doing. Do it when you can. By the way, ah... remind me to buy you a new car. And I think you should have a Packard. Packards haven't been made for 30 years, Gramp. Oh? I guess you're out of luck then. There's a new shipment coming into the store today. Lots of pre-war British poetry. Great. Oh, you're not interested. Sure I am. Pre which war? First. Somebody help me up or I'll be late for work. You don't go to work, Gramp. You're retired. That is a rumor they started to try to force me out. By the way, remember one thing: If it's worth doing it's worth overdoing. Umm, that's why we're always broke. Don't worry about it. I'm on the verge. Of what? Ah... that's a good question. I need a tailor. I'm shrinking. VICKY: I'll take them in. You will? Yeah. Good. [**] ["I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT ANYMORE" BY DUSTY SPRINGFIELD PLAYS] * In my neighborhood * We don't live so good * The rooms are small * And the building's Made of wood * * I hear The neighbors talking * * About you and me * I guess I heard it all * 'Cause the talk is loud * And the walls * Are much too thin * He don't really love her * That's what I heard them say * * He sure Wasn't thinking of her * * The other day * Oh, no, no, no * I saw him in the front yard * Said the boy in room 149 * He was talking to a girl When do you expect him? Blair. * Standing there together * I don't want to hear it Anymore * CHORUS: * I don't want to hear it Anymore * * I don't want to hear it Hi. Mr. Kenmore called. Fred Breck from Citibank and a Mr. Blair just called for Frederick Stockheinz of Trans Allied Silver. What's his number? He said he'd call back. Where is my... Where is... I can't believe it... Wise guy. Didn't you tell Doris you'd have Zeroxes of those credit forms on her desk by three p.m. last Friday? I meant... Yes or no? Yeah, I... You just what? You just forgot? No, there was a meeting-- That's the second time this month. Why don't you use that tone of voice on an uncle? I don't have an uncle. Well then, why don't you use it on Hayes or somebody whose in a position to fire you? Don't use it on her. [PHONE RINGS] Excuse me. Mr. Levin's office. BLAIR: Is Byron Levin in? It's Blair. Hello? Levin? Yeah. Byron Levin, here. Frederick Stockheinz wants to see you. What for? I'm parked in front of your bank in a black Seville. Get in. I have a car. He wants me to take you. You work for him. I don't. Where is he? The Bonaventure Hotel. How will I know who he is? You'll know. WOMAN [ON PHONE]: What do you want me to do? I'll try money first, but if it doesn't work, I want you to get in the hotel. Mr. Stockheinz? Go back to the door and you stay over there. Sit down. WOMAN 2: Yes, Mr. Stockheinz? Ring my suite. [PHONE RINGS] People don't like bankers. Have you ever noticed that? I don't think of myself as a banker. I made my offer. I don't like bankers, myself. I don't trust them. WAITER: Yes, sir, Mr. Stockheinz? Bring Mr. Levin white wine and a lobster salad. WAITER: Right away. I'm not hungry. STOCKHEINZ: You will be. Why did you ask me here? What do you know about Trans Allied Silver? That you run it. I don't run it, I own it. What about what you wrote in Galbraith's Economics Seminar at Harvard? "With the multinational corporations, patriotism has become loyalty not to the mother country, but to the mother company: government in the service of business. A vivid case in point is Trans Allied Silver. Stockheinz and his billion-dollar corporation have complete control of the economy and political life of Costa Salva." Yes? Try my suite again. Allied Silver is not a corporation. It's a civilization. I'm sorry, Mr... Is that what you call wanting to control the world? Civilization? Keep trying. That's what you are paid for. Look. I don't have the time to, ah-- To make a million dollars in one weekend? Cash. No taxes. Your former roommate. This will be out tomorrow. You'd be doing him a big favor if you change his mind. About what? Yes? MAN: She was here sir, but she's gone. Where is she now? She's waiting for him in front of the hotel. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] I love Lorenzo. You know. I bought him his first horse when he was six? And a Maserati when he was 14? But he must not abuse my love. He must not steal my silver. Nationalize. That's what it is, stealing. The silver's there, in Costa Salva. It's his land. Why his? We're not in 1949. The nation-state's... are dead. The future's with money, not with governments. They have no power now. They are owned. In ten years, multinationals will own 65 percent of the world. How old are you, 28? 30. Too old to be a lackey in a bank filled with other people's money. You were hungry, after all. I'm not going to do anything against Lorenzo. When you change your mind, call me. Thank you. VALET: Good afternoon, Mrs. Stockheinz [**] I'm Byron Levin I just had lunch with your husband. White wine and lobster salad? Uh-huh. I hope you enjoyed it. You're rotting your soul, do you know that? Excuse me, I'm late. If you ever touch him again, or any other man, I'll kill you. [**] I got six great books today. That's terrific. And not Just the, ah... pre-war British. I got a signed first edition of Lowell's Imitations. That's great. And how was your day? Same. Who are you? Byron, your grandson. Oh, hello, darling. And how are your head, your back, your hips and your spirits? I could use some spirits. You didn't ask about my love life. That's because you've been out of action for awhile, Gramp. Is that the truth? Who is she? That's Vicky. The face is gorgeous. And there's no beard on it. Why don't you marry her? Oh, Byron's not ready to get married. He's only 30. I thought you didn't want to get married. I don't. I want to wait another 40 or 50 years until we get to know each other. Byron, do you mind if I ask you a question? Go right ahead. What am I worth? A lot. You're smart, you're generous-- I want a figure in dollars and cents. There you might come up a little short. I thought I was a millionaire. You were. Who stole it? Nobody stole it. We blew it. Stocks, bonds... bad timing. Who's taking care of me now? You're taking care of yourself, Gramp. Don't kid me. Who's paying the rent here? I am. I must be a terrible burden to both of you. You are the joy of our lives. And if you weren't here, I don't think I would be, either. What do you do with yourself, darling? I'm a book dealer. Baseball, football? Ha. No, that's a bookmaker. I buy and sell books. But is it profitable? Sometimes. Motherless cunt. I will not have this kind of talk in my house. Hey... look it. It's Lorenzo. God, he great, doesn't he? This in the United States is the equivalent of, ah... two dollars. This is not an economy. We need a hundred million dollars to go for food, housing, medicines, schools, roads, land, hospitals... you see. But in answer to your question, I am willing to talk to the government of the United States. I am more than willing. But you see, in the position that I am in now, I have to keep an open mind. So, I'll talk to anyone. Anyone? Even Frederick Stockheinz, the Chairman of the Board of Trans Allied Silver? Mr. Stockheinz was a very dear friend of my father's. And he is always welcome to Costa Salva, as a tourist. Mr. President, aren't you afraid that some people will-- You see, I am afraid of one thing, is that I will let the people of Costa Salva down. But before I do this, I will die. Thank you, Mr. President. That's easy for him to say. He's only 14 years old. A man without money has no weight in the world. None. Boy, does he have it down. VICKY: Jealous? Maybe. He's doing what he love, I'm doing what I hate. Frederick Stockheinz! I had lunch with him today, What? He sent someone over to the bank for me. How could you even talk to him? Curiosity. He wants me to work on Lorenzo. You told him to go to hell? He offered me a million dollars. Well, what did you say? GRAMP: This is the Frederick Stockheinz who died with the long toe nails and fingernails? That was Howard Hughes, Gramp. Stockheinz is still alive. Stay away from him. They're all the same. What did you say? I said, yes. You did not. That's right. I did not. I told him to go hell. [PHONE RINGS] GRAMP: Byron, don't leave me. I'm only gonna answer the phone, Gramp. Ask who's there. Hello? Make sure it's not an enemy. Who's calling? Bob. Oh, I'll take it inside. Who's Bob? Oh, he's from the book store. Byron, what... what, ah... city are we in? In Paris? Los Angeles. Who's in Paris? Ten million Parisians. What a lot of Frenchmen. Oh, my... my. Eat your steak. Spinach, I like better. [**] GRAMP: Help. Help. Help. Gramp? Shh. They'll hear you. Who? All of them. I am in mortal danger. I'll protect you. You're not taking me seriously. Have I ever told you before that I was in mortal danger? Yes. When? Last night, the night before. And the night before that. Oh, when they've taken me away you'll be sorry you laughed at me. I'm not laughing at you. You... you think I don't know what's happened to me? Come on, go to sleep, Gramp. Oh, go on... get away from me... get away. Get away. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Hello? CATHERINE: This is Catherine Stockheinz. Hi. How often do you say to women what you said to me? Never. Do you want to see me? When? At Casey's in 15 minutes. How, how uh... * He don't really love her * That's what I heard them say * * He sure Wasn't thinking of her * * The other day Ah, a bloody Mary, please. * Oh, no, no, no * I saw him In the front yard * * Said the boy in room 149 * He was talking to a girl * I've never seen before * Standing there together * I don't want to hear it Anymore * OPERATOR: Bonaventure Hotel. Mrs. Stockheinz, please. Room 3108. I'll ring her for you. CATHERINE: Hello? What happened? Hello. Hello. * Heartache soon begins * The talk is so loud * And the walls Are much too thin * OPERATOR: Bonaventure Hotel. Ah, yes, operator, I was talking to room 3108 and we were dis... ah, I don't know... cut off. Ah... You weren't cut off. The party hung up and there's a do-not-disturb on that line now. * That when * A nice girl Falls in love * * Ain't it just too bad * That she had to fall * For a boy * Who doesn't care For her at all * * I don't want to hear it Anymore * CHORUS: * I don't want to hear it Anymore * * I just can't stand To hear it anymore * * Anymore * 'Cause the talk Just never ends * * And the heartache Soon begins * * The talk is so loud * And the walls * Are much too thin Byron, are you all right? Yeah. Loan applications. Yeah. To all of them? Unh. Yes. [BOTH LAUGHING] [**] I'm being decapitated. Save me, darling. Don't move and everything'll be fine. I have more hair on the left side than I have on the right, but you keep chopping away at the right. I'll finish the left in a second. In my day, barbers didn't argue. They said, "Yes, sir, Mr. Klein," and "No, Sir, Mr. Klein." Tell me something, darling, who is Ruth? Your daughter, my mother. Slowly now, I don't want to miss this. My daughter is your mother? That's right. My darling daughter. Oh, my darling daughter. Do me a favor? Give mother a call. I have a terrible feeling something has happened to her. She's dead, Gramp. Who's dead? Mom. Ruth. Oh, no. Your daughter. Oh, no, no. Don't do that, Gramp. When did it happen? 26 years ago. Why wasn't I told? You were. What about my mother? She's been dead a long time. They're all dead. No one's left. I'm left. Who are you? Byron, your grandson. Don't leave me. Don't ever leave me. I'll never leave you. Who else is left? You're left. Who am I? Walter Klein. Shh. Not so loud. They'll hear you. I'm next on the list. There is no list. That's easy for you to say. Would you take my place? Anytime. Are you writing this down? Oh, Byron's word's good. I wouldn't trust him if he were my sister. A woman as beautiful as you can get away with anything. Oh, I look horrible. You look gorgeous, like a Biblical beauty: Delilah or Bathsheba or Marion Davies. * Oh, swing low Sweet chariot * * Comin' for To carry me home * * Swing low Sweet chariot * * Comin' for To carry me home * Why did he stop? Why did who stop? The fellow who was singing? That was you. Ha? Was I good? You were excellent. Call the Metropolitan Opera. I'll call the Metropolitan Opera. What do you want me to tell them, Mr. Klein? Who? The Metropolitan. Let them wait. They need me. I don't need them. [PHONE RINGS] There they are. [PHONE RINGS] STOCKHEINZ: Hello? Hello? Tell them to speak to my attorney. [HUNG UP] Who was it? Nobody. [EXHALES] Ah, I'm gonna go for a drive. Where? I don't know. [DOOR CLOSES] [HORN HONKS] CATHERINE: Who is it? Byron Levin. [LOCK OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] Let's go. Who do you think you are? Snif. Come on. C-Come on. You're kidnapping me. Okay. Okay. Okay. But you're not going to make love to me. I'll never touch you again. Until you ask me to. You must think I'm as insane as you are. Answer me. What's the question? What is so special about me that you do all these things that I could have you arrested for. Your eyes, your smile. I didn't smile at you. Okay, I guess it was your eyes, then. You must be very lonely. No. It's just that when I saw you, I knew. Knew what? That God put his elbow in my ribs. I want to get out. Go ahead. What are you doin'? Wait. What are you tryin' to kill us? What's the matter with you. Close the door. I thought you were going to kill me, anyway. I said, if you ever made love to your husband... I did. [SNIFS] Come on. Come on. Why? Because we're gonna fall in love and last together. I couldn't hear what you said. I said that we're... Get in and I'll repeat it. [**] [**] CATHERINE: How did you know I wouldn't call the police? BYRON: I didn't. BYRON: I've been waiting for years for something to come along. Something, someone who'd change my life. CATHERINE: Do you live alone? I live with my grandfather... and a girl. Do you love her? We get along. [SEAGULLS CAWING] When did you meet Stockheinz? At a dinner party in London. Who's party? The Moroccan Ambassador's. Another penniless boyfriend? He wasn't my boyfriend. I was with someone else. But you left with Stockheinz? He took me home. And? We said goodnight. And? He called me the next morning unh, and asked me out for dinner. And you said yes? I said, I didn't think we should see each other anymore. He apologized for having bothered me and said goodbye. The next day he called you. Unh, I called him. And said what? That you wanted to meet him at Casey's? Fooking. And he came? And you didn't? And he waited-- We both came. And then we went back to his hotel and three days later he called me from Buenos Aires and proposed. I wanted to meet you last night, but I couldn't. You're full of shit. [EXHALES] [BELL TOLLING] [SEAGULL CAWING] [**] [EXHALES] I can't believe it. I can't get a hard-on. [EXHALES] All the way, in the car, in the bank, five minutes ago, outside, I had a hard-on. I coulda hung a towel on it. Unh. Now, every time... every time in my life, something... something goes right, it always seems to go wrong. Just relax. It will come. No, no, no. It'll come. You don't understand. Ohh, you know, ah... You know the National Anthem? What? The Star Spangled Banner? I know the words. Yeah. I cannot sing. Then recite it for me. Come on. Oh, say can you see By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's Last gleaming. * Whose broad stripes And bright stars * * Through the perilous fight * For the ramparts we watch * Were so gallantly streaming * And the rockets Red glare... * What are you doing? I'm looking at it. What does it look like? Beautiful. Is it different? Un-huh. How? It's yours. [**] BYRON: Who was there before Stockheinz? CAHTERINE: There were a few. Who was the first? An Italian. Mussolini? Renzo Caldone. He owned a construction company. Who else was there? A Spaniard. Who owns half of Madrid? A few acres. No rich industrialist from Rio? Why are you asking me all this? To hurt me... or to excite yourself? No. Both. CATHERINE: What made you go into banking? Boredom, stupidity, failure. I tried a lot of things. Teaching, driving a cab, writing. What kind of writing? Comedy. I used to write some skits and... short plays. I had a very good ear for, ah... voices. Used to do impressions. Who? Anybody. Do Burt Lancaster. [LAUGHS] [IMITATES LANCASTER] Catherine, I want you to take your middle finger, I want you to shove it right up life's ass. [POPS] [CATHERINE CHUCKLES] [LAUGHS LIKE LANCASTER] Who else? Ah, let's see. Who's this? [IMITATES STOCKHEINZ] Sit down. Sit down. Hmm. Trans Allied Silver is not a Corporation. It is a civilization. Umm, I love Lorenzo. Oh, but he must not abuse my love. I bought him his first Maserati when he was two. And his first spaceship when he was three. [GRUNTS] Oh, but he must not steal my silver. [BOTH LAUGH] Who else can you do? Ah... [IMITATES CATHERINE] Frederick, darling. I love you, but I can't wait for you to drop dead, because you're so much older than I am and you're so much richer. And when you die, I will inherit all your money, and go to Europe with Ulf, and travel to Sweden, 'Cause it's so beautiful. You understand nothing. About what? Frederick, me, anything. [PANTING] Tell me you'll never leave me. Tell me you will never leave me. Tell me. I won't. You won't what? You won't what? You won't what? You won't what? You won't what? Tell me. Tell me. I love you. [SOBING] [WHISPERING] I love you. Give that to me. Who's that? Lorenzo Caldoni? [CLEARS THROAT] Is it your father? Where is he now? Dead. Why don't you die, too? Kill me if I ever touch another man. Last until we die. You're full of shit. [SPEAKS ITALIAN] You couldn't even keep yourself from sniffing after that girl in front of the hotel. What girl? Like a dog. I was clearing my sinuses. You were the one who was looking at that repulsive grease ball John. I never look at strangers. What about me? I thought you were different. Where are you going? Anywhere away from you. Don't say that. We're going to be everything to each other. What? I'm you're father, you're my mother. I'm your-husband, you're my wife. I'm your chauffer, you're my car. [CHUCKLES] Hey... [**] CATHERINE: When I was 12, I came home from school one day... My mother and my sister were away, but it was strange because every other day my father had been at the door to kiss me and smile at me and ask me everything that happened. I called out for him, but there was no answer. I looked in the living room, in the kitchen, in the library. I went upstairs and knocked on the door of his bedroom, there was still no answer. I tried to open it but it was locked. I ran downstairs again, got the key, ran back upstairs and opened the door. He was hanging... naked, from the rafters. His penis was sticking out and his feet were blue. [WHISPERING] I'm not going to let you down. Catherine! OPERATOR: Bonaventure Hotel. Stockheinz, 3108. STOCKHEINZ: Yes? Who is this? Hankland wants to see you. Tell him I'll see him later. He's here to see you. I have some bad news for you, Byron. You're fired. [WHISPERING] What's the matter? [WHISPERING] That's a strange question to ask after your little vacation, don't you think? I got fired. What? When? Just now. Why? Stockheinz. Jesus. Does it control the world? Part of it. I'm glad. My life stopped when I took that job. So did mine. [**] OPERATOR: Bonaventure Hotel. Stockheinz, 3108. STOCKHEINZ: Yes? This is Byron Levin. Is it too late to reconsider? Be in front of your house in an hour. What are you doing? You're going to Costa Salva. GRAMP: Police! Police! Officer, take out your revolver. We're surrounded. It's Byron, Gramp. There's nothing to be afraid of. I knew we shouldn't have moved to Paris. Los Angeles was bad enough. We're not in Paris, Gramp. [SOBING] You broke the binding. You don't give a damn, do you? I'm sorry. I'll pay you for it. Oh, with what? Stockheinz's money? Don't leave me, Byron. I have to, Gramp. I'll be back in a few days. I-I promise you. Did you hear that? He promised you. What more could you want? Don't use him. I hate you. It's all over, isn't it? No, it's Just... Go ahead, abandon me. I don't need you. Glad to have you on the team. Don't you ever confuse me with you. Yes. Just do it. Ride in the cockpit. You, too, Luis. Yes, sir. Ah, were you expecting someone else? No. No, no, no. I just thought... STOCKHEINZ: Byron Levin, my wife. How do you do? A pleasure. Let's go. STOCKHEINZ: It doesn't matter what he says on television. He knows that Costa Salva cannot survive without help. Bring Mr. Levin champagne and shrimp. You're always ordering for me but you never eat anything yourself. Food is not important to me. Look this over, I want you to be prepared. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] [WHISPERING] What does he know? [WHISPERING] About what? Us. What is there to know? Do you know what I'd like to do to you right now? Shh. Right now. Touch me? Kiss me? Make love to me? I'd like to break your neck. Counting my freckles? [SIGHS] Are you busy, baby? Massage me. [BOTH SPEAK ITALIAN] [LAUGHS] [CHATTERING] I cabled Lorenzo to tell him you were coming down. Frederick, I must say, you're a sight for sore eyes. Oh, you look marvelous, dear. Thank you. It's a great honor, Sir. [LAUGHING, CHATTERING] SANZER: We need you in Costa Salva now more than ever. How are you, Melanie? Gee, you look great, Mr. Stockheinz. I don't know how you do it. Clean living. ALL: Ha, ha, ha. How's your President? He avoids us. It's hard to believe that he's his father's son. [CHUCKLES] That's a strange costume you're wearing. Well, that's a strange airline you're flying, unless you did it for the stewardess. Catherine. Stockheinz. Yes, I've heard stories about how lovely you were but this is unfair. She should be a princess or a queen. You're embarrassing me. You must hear this all the time. Not from the ruler of a country. Lorenzo. Uncle Frederick. Why are you wearing a beard? So I can look like Abraham Lincoln. [LAUGHS] So, you'll stay at the Palace with me, huh? Of course he would. Good. I'd love to invite everyone here, but my jeep seats only two. How uncomfortable does it if there are three? That all depends on who the third person is. Oh, go ahead. I'll see you at the Embassy. You stay at the airport, Luis. Okay, Mr. Stockheinz. BYRON: What happened to your Maserati? A Jeep is democratic. Has your husband come to Costa Salva for a last look? I think he has a bit more on his mind. A Suntan? Frederick doesn't like the sun, he likes silver. He's done quite well for himself with my country's silver. I know that working with you is more important to him than anything. Not more important than you. You're still trying to make me blush. Do you really blush so easily? I get angry easily. So does Frederick. [LAUGHS] Byron, she's fantastic, huh? This is the kind of woman we should marry, huh? [LAUGHS] [MAN SPEAKING SPANISH NEARBY] [SPEAKS SPANISH] [CHEERING] [MAN SPEAKING SPANISH] [ALL CHEERING] [BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH] ALL: Prado! Prado! ["MI PRIMER AMOR" BY JOSÉ AUGUSTO PLYING] Will you come to the Embassy for lunch? Yes. It will be my pleasure. Two o'clock. Fine. LORENZO: You can't stop yourself with her. BYRON: I don't know. Do you want to? No. When I got Stockheinz' telex, I thought you were coming down here for him. Now you know I wasn't? What did he want from you? He wanted me to try to convince you to go along with him, the way your father did. Bribes, kickbacks, no nationalization. How much did he offer you? A million dollars. [LAUGHING] I'm sorry. About what? A million dollars to convince me? To kill me. Stockheinz may be many things, but he's no fool. Anytime you want to kill a man, you go for his bodyguard or his friend. [LAUGHS] You still have innocence, Vido. Of course, maybe if you cared less about this obsession with romance and this ideal woman of yours, you would see things with a clearer eye. [IMITATES LORENZO] Señor Presidente, such words of wisdom are overwhelming. A million dollars, huh? I'm going to change everything in Costa Salva. Even the National Anthem. I wrote a new one myself. Do you want to hear it? No. [SINGS IN SPANISH] What do you think? A little short, isn't it? I want it to be. I want a society built on impatience. I like the "Star Spangled Banner" better. ["VAS A VOLAR AMOR" BY CLAY CARRILLON PLAYING] [BYRON SPEAKS SPANISH] I know this girl. Name's Pilar. Hey, Pilar, [LORENZO SPEAKING SPANISH] [LAUGHS] [BOTHS SPEAKING SPANISH] [WOMAN LAUGHS] [LORENZO SINGING IN SPANISH] [LAUGHING] What happened to Vido? The young lady will join me in a minute. Is that why you did it, to test me? Who knows why we do anything. Well, you better not put that in any of your speeches. [LAUGHS] How is your grandfather? In and out. [SPEAKS SPANISH] [LAUGHS] [KIDS SINGING IN SPANISH] It's no longer the Presidential Palace, you know. It's the Palace of the people. You want to get back to her? I'll see you later then. [SPEAKS SPANISH] [GOAT BAA] [SPEAKS SPANISH] LORENZO: Hello? Lorenzo, listen. I think there is something going on. What is it? I'm in the market place, and Blair, Stockheinz' guy, is talking to someone who looks like one of your people. Oh, don't worry about this. What do you mean, don't worry? You said it yourself, you always go for a bodyguard or a friend. Stockheinz is paying someone off to kill you. [JEEP APPROACHING] [MAN SPEAKS SPANISH] You are all idiots. You have messed up everything. The mountains, the city, the port. They are completely unprotected. Idiots. [MAN SPEAKS SPANISH] STOCKHEINZ: I'm not interested in your nonsense. [MAN SPEAKS SPANISH] [DOOR OPENS] You're early. Where is Lorenzo? You came to Costa Salva to do a Job for Frederick. Have you done it? Why are you doing this? Don't you see? See what? That this is what we were made for. What were we made for? Obsession... ecstasy... love. Who do you think you are? Do you think, because I let you make love to me, that you have some claim on me? Let me? You've nothing to do with me. Nothing. What are you doing here? What have you done with Lorenzo? I haven't done anything with Lorenzo. PAULTZ: I hope the President's not too offended when he sees we've started without him. He's 90 minutes late. To the future of Costa Salva. To the future of America. I've had too much champagne, Mr. Stockheinz. Do you think I'll Jinx the toast if I drink coffee instead? Not if you drink it black. MELANIE: "Black as the Devil, hot as hell. Pure as an angel, sweet as love." That's what Talleyrand said about coffee. Talleyrand was the greatest diplomat in the history of the world. Until Ambassador Paultz came along. Oh, I think I can accept second place to Talleyrand. SANZER: I'd like to propose a toast to the memory of our never to be forgotten, leader Francisco Prado. May his life serve as a model. MELANIE: For everybody or Just Lorenzo? Can it, Melanie. You know, in spite of all the nonsense one hears about Costa Salva's having been a dictatorship, the fact is that Francisco Prado held five elections in 30 years. I wonder how many other countries can make that claim. Of course, with the kind of elections my father had, who'd want to make such a claim. Sit, sit, sit. [SPEAKS SPANISH] You look ravishing. You know, we have a story about that in Costa Salva. A story of three of the most remarkable men in the world. The President of the United States, The Pope, and my father. One night, they were all on a shark-infested sea in this boat but the boat was built for one person. They couldn't decide who should be saved. So the President of the United States said: "I am the leader of the greatest nation on earth and I'm the one who should be saved." And the Pope said: "But I am the spiritual guide of the greatest church on Earth, don't you think I should be safe?" And my father said: "Democracy, I am the hope of democracy in all Latin America. What we shall do is vote to see who shall be saved." So, three men voted and my father won by 12 votes. [ALL LAUGHS] What is so funny? My father used to laugh at it. MELANIE: My father would have laughed too, Mr. President. He was chairman of the Republican party back home and he used to buy elections always. Yes. It you wanted to vote against my father, you just wrote "no" on the ballet, but this was defacing public property and you got 20 years for it. I resent that charge. He was the greatest ruler in Latin America. It's too bad he had such a slow learner for a son. STOCKHEINZ: It is, indeed. Your father died with one great fear, that you would let him down. Did he say this to you in Spanish or in English? He said it with respect. A respect of a dog for his master. Where did you pick up all this feeling for the people? On your yacht? In Monte Carlo with your Maserati? [CATHERINE SPEAKS ITALIAN] You don't care if your people starve. PAULTZ: I'm sure that's not what the President meant, Frederick. I'm sure-- Shut up. LORENZO: What you must accept is that my people are no longer for sale. STOCKHEINZ: Who's talking about buying people? You did. By implication. I say what's on my mind. You don't see what's on other people's minds. They do not wish to be humiliated the way you just humiliated your ambassador. I think if you knew how Frederick felt-- The President hasn't finished dear, or are you? Frederick, please... Who do you think you are? What do you think this country would be without me? You wasn't even born when I was teaching Costa Salva how to mine and to sell what was right underneath it's feet. I, ah... really feel it's time-- Nobody asked what you feel! Ah... I think, ah-- PAULTZ: Dear... ah... Frederick is our guest, Rupert. And I think it's time to go inside before the shooting starts. I'd like to preserve the china and the stemware. I hope you won't think me ungracious if I excuse myself. I've a lot of work to do. Of course. It's been an honor having you, Mr. President. You're not going to get away with this. General, I want to talk to you alone. Call the airport and tell Luis to get the plane ready. Pack. Tell me why you called me that first night. I help Frederick in any way I can. You're saying you set me up? Is that what you're saying? You didn't do that for him. In the beginning... yes. [CHATTERING] BYRON: I thought the Captain goes last. STOCKHEINZ: Don't worry. Your protector's here. PAULTZ: Good luck, Frederick. You really want to get yourself hurt, huh? Pull up. Get rid of him. Do it! [MOANING, GRUNTING] [MOANS] Drive. [BELL TOLLS] [SPEAKS SPANISH] [IN BAD SPANISH] I'm Lorenzo's friend. You better brush up your Spanish, my friend, I don't understand what you're saying. No, no, I'm a friend of Lorenzo's. [SHOUTS IN SPANISH] Good, that makes two of us. I don't think you understand-- I do understand! I don't think you understand. Oh, sure I do. [SPEAKS SPANISH] [SPEAKS SPANISH] [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Raul. You eliminated someone very important to me. You even have the language down, don't you? I thought Stockheinz had paid Blair to have you killed. You were the one who paid Blair to have Stockheinz killed. You're becoming just like Stockheinz and your father. Stockheinz and my father and everything they represent and the Western World as far as I'm concerned, is dead. There's a new force on this earth. And nothing's gonna stop it. [GUNSHOTS] Do you think that any European Prime Minister... you think any American President is any different? Do you think they give one fuck who they do business with? There's no pride, there's no sense of nation, just greed. You could've joined me. You could've worked with me. You could've been of use. You gonna get me out of here or not? [SPEAKS SPANISH] OPERATOR: Bonaventure Hotel. Stockheinz, 3108. Thank you. [LINE TONE] What happened to you? I cut myself shaving. [**] BYRON: You're saying you set me up? CATHERINE: In the beginning... yes. BYRON: Gramp. [MOANING] Gramp. Gramp. Gramp. Gramp. Gramp. Gramp. Gramp! [DOGS BARKING] Gramp! Gramp! [BAND PLAYING "THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER"] CATHERINE: How uncomfortable does it get if there are three? That depends on who the third person is. What a vision of loveliness. Could this be a dream? Where are you going? West to the sunset. Tell me the truth. Do you really think we have any chance of lasting together? No. [CHUCKLES] Neither do I. [**]
