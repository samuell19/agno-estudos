The band I told you to check out? I don't remember. No, I think I already gave it to you. Wait. Let me check. I found it. I'll bring it to you so you can check it out. Come on. Good shot. One more. Woah, that's how you play? Take it! Take it or not? -There you go. -Damn. -Asshole. -Behind you. Are you sure you aren't mad at me? Well, he likes you. I thought he wanted to hit on me. I still love you, Meen. Singh is cute, huh? Who is it? Nobody. I bet it's your mom. There. She has been calling me like hunderd times. Seriously? What have you done this time? I'm tired of lying for you. Don't you feel bad for your mom? Running off like this? I'm the one you should feel bad for. My mom doesn't love me anymore. Don't be silly. She loves you so much. You two can't be apart. But Ting is different. Wow! Woah! Joy. Woah! Meen. -Let's go. -Joy, your serve. -Wow! -Woohoo! Bottom's up! Hey. She passed out. -Let's go. -Yeah. Joy, you should go to bed. Meen, I'll take care of Joy. Let Singh take care of her. Joy, let's get you to bed. -Meen. -Hey, that's fine. -I'll take care of it. -Keep playing, Meen Meen. Let's play. It's starting. I really love you, Joy. I love you too, Singh. Joy. Joy! Joy! What's wrong? Joy! Joy! What's wrong? Joy! Joy! Joy! Karn! Karn! Help me out! Hurry up! Karn! Singh, what did you do to her? Joy! Joy! Joy has asthma! She must be allergic to the drugs! Let's go to the hospital! What the hell? -What's your problem? -We can't go to the hospital! What if they find out about the drugs? Are you gonna let her die? -Damn you! -Singh, calm down. She's a celebrity. It'll be on the news. Joy! You stole my car, right? -Damn! -No, Dad. -Where are the keys to the beach house? -Your dad? You're there, right? Singh, what's happening? Joy is dead. You said it was safe. Safe my ass! Tell me! Asshole! You can't blame me. You drugged her. What are you talking about? Meen! -Calm down, Meen! -Let me go! Calm down. -Calm down! -I want to go home! -Meen! -Let me go! Calm down! Meen! Let me go! Meen! -Let me go! -What do you want me to do? Stop it! Meen! Let me go! You, get out! Meen! What are you doing, Singh? Where are you taking my friend? You can't! Don't you want to go home? Where are we going? You coming here, no one at home knows about it, right? The dead cannot be saved, but we're still here. I really didn't mean to do it, Joy. You mean a lot to me, Joy. How much? More than anything in the world. Don't lie to me, OK? Please, Meen. Don't make things worse. Singh! Damn, what should we do? Help me, please! -Help! -Meen! Shut up! Singh! Do something! -Hi. -Oh, it's you, Singh. Where's your Dad? He didn't come. I saw his car. I came with friends. Do you need something? Can I borrow your corkscrew? I can't find mine at home. Just a second. Here you go. Thanks. -Bye. -Wait... How many of you're here? Three. Not four? I saw four of you in the car this morning. Just three. You must have been mistaken. I guess so. Something fell down, I think. It's nothing. -Bye, Uncle Chet. -OK. What the hell? Hey! Hey! Damn it! Help me. Somebody help me! Help! -Where are you going? Shut up! -Help me. I said shut up! Help me. -You don't understand? -That's enough. I'm trying to help you out! Just let me go. -I really want to go home. -Hey. Damn! I told you to stop. Why did you punch me? Things are bad enough already. I've got Meen. You get the suitcase. I'll get her. You bury the suitcase! Ladies and gentlemen. Don't hurry home just yet! Tonight, we'll have a big fireworks display. Meen. Go back with me nicely. Shoot me. Shoot me in front of these people if you dare. You know it was an accident. Joy trusted you guys. Don't you feel bad for her? Meen. Don't force me to do this. Just shoot. I called a hundred times! Why didn't you pick up? Got yourself in trouble again, didn't you? Uncle Chet already told me. He saw a girl's bag in the house. -Yes, Dad. -You have me... Come at me, asshole! Come! Karn! Karn! Karn! Drop the weapon! I'm sorry. Where's Joy? Where's Joy? Meen. Meen! How did this happen? How were you involved? Excuse me, did you know the dead person? I don't know those guys. Joy asked me to come. Sorry, so you're... I'm sorry. Are you OK? I saw the news. Don't worry. I'm sorry for what happened. Are you all right? I want you to draft your speech for the scholarship award. Bring it to me first. So we can help you review it. All right. Meen! -Congratulations. Can we take your photo? -Yes. One, two... MEEN - SHOW THE DEATH SOME RESPECT JOY - LIAR -It's not that late! -It is. My mom will nag me. Let's go. -That sucks. -Wait. I forgot my bag. -What? -I'll go get it. Wait. -Wait for me. -Hurry! I'm hungry. Meen. You're home early today. Don't you have an after-school class? Today is Tuesday. Those classes are on Wednesdays and Fridays. By the way, mom, will you make it to the school ceremony? Let's see again when it's time. I have three meetings. I will finish late. Do you have some important matter? No. You're so pretty. Move there a bit. That way. Come in. Yeah, that's right. OK. Very good. Let's start, gorgeous. Ready? One, two, three. When I see you get prettier, it reminds me of Joy. Hey, you! -I'm sorry. -That's fine. Nan! Is that you, Nan? I forgot my bag upstairs. Can you take me there? I need my glasses. Nan. Nan. Nan. Everyone! I'm locking up! Are you gonna spend the night here? Meen! Where are you going? Aren't you going to class? Yes, I am. About your speech, have you done it? Not yet. I don't know what to write about. Write about Joy? Your friends would like that. That would be great. Writing about Joy and Meen. Why is it "Joy and Meen"? Why not "Meen and Joy"? It's a whole number. Starting from three. And add in... She's cute. Why did you change my picture? Why did you change it? Didn't you hear me? My picture! Why did you change it? Are you that jealous of me? -What? -Where are you going? I'm the best student! I deserve the scholarship! Bank! Did you do this? What are you talking about, Meen? Why did you swap my picture with Joy's? What the hell are you talking about? What Joy's picture? You're all in on this, right? Are you that jealous? Answer me! Why did you swap the pictures? Tell me, Bank! Why did you do it? You, stop! What Joy's picture? That's you, Meen! That's you, too! MEEN HAS BEEN WEIRD LATELY - SUM IT UP IN THREE WORDS - GONE FREAKING LUNATIC This will be on the exam? Definitely. Memorize it. Hey! You're making a mess in my book. I don't need your autograph here. I can't study anymore. My head hurts. You'll get the scholarship for sure. That would be great. So my mom will pay more attention to me, like your mom does. Though your mom doesn't care about you, I'll still always be by your side. You're important to me, Meen. Yeah, I know. About the scholarship, I won't complete against you for it. Really? Are you sure? I swear. Why did she do this? This must be a prank. What are you looking at? Hey. No need to clean it off. I'll do it. There are more in the bathrooms. It must be the same person. Who are you? Why are you doing this? Who are you? Ann. You go ahead. I'll catch up. OK, see you. -OK. See you. -See you. Why are you doing this? Because you lied. About what? You told reporters that you didn't know those guys you went to the beach with. How the hell could you lie like that? Do you know how bad it made Joy look? My mom's sad enought that Joy is dead. And she has to deal with this too? I really don't know them. Joy invited me there. Stop lying! I looked through Joy's phone. She got that jerk's number from you, didn't she? Ting, stop messing with me. Stop your pranks, if you don't want trouble for you and your mom. Your girlfriend, too. You know what? I still feel bad about Joy. Stop lying! Let's go, Ann. Ting! Ting! Ting! -What's over there? -Let's take a look. I thought you couldn't come. Meen. Please go standby backstage in 10 minutes. When they call your name, you go on up. I'll come get you again. Hello, beloved parents and students. Welcome to the Scholarship Award Ceremony of St. Catherine's school. According to our school mission... Stop! I said, stop! Ann! Stop right now! Ann, open the door! I'm not the killer! I didn't do it! I didn't kill. I didn't kill. I didn't kill. Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy! (Teacher - I received your porfolio. The scholarship interview is on Monday.) For the last jump of Jeerasak Muangmookda, it was great and has put him in third place. This is his best finish so far. Though it's not enough to qualify him for the next round. You were busy with Joy. I'm sorry. In here, there are these multi-vitamins and chlorophyll which are good for your skin and your health. Please take special care of Ting. -I'll see what I can do. -Thank you very much. Ting! You have a mom? Does she think it's a popularity contest? Don't forget to tell your mom to make a neon sign that says "Ting and Mom". I love my mom so much. -Kiss! Kiss! -Let's go. Ting. You've been home for a while now. Why didn't you eat first? You'll get stomach ulcer. This is gross. It's good for you. Joy never complained. You don't have to do that even if you don't like it. -Let me help, mom. -No, don't! If you cut yourself, you'll miss the competition. Ting. Why did you to this? Joy has gone in peace. Put everything back to place. I didn't do this, mom. Mom. Can you come home early today? Why? I don't wanna be home alone. Is something wrong? Joy is still in our home. What are you talking about? It's true. Don't I take care of you well enough? You don't believe me. Stop talking nonsense, Ting. Hey, Ting. -How much did your mom pay the coach? -What do you mean? Don't act innocent, asshole. You want to be famous just like your sister. Ting. You're competing next week. You should practice well. I picked you to represent the High Board. What about Boss? I already made my decision. Do your best then. What did you say to the coach? I did it for you. I want you to have a chance to win. Is that all you care about, winning? Yes, you have to win. If you don't win, then why bother at all? Fine! But If I win the first place, then we move out of this house. We'll move out of this house, if you win the first place. You promise me, all right? Mom. I'm sorry. I pushed you too hard. When you get out of the hospital, we'll move out of the house. Ting, do want to take your old guitar? Yes, mom. Ting! Can you check the fuse box for me? What is this? We've only just met a few times. Hello? Ting, I won't make it in time. But I have tryouts today, mom. What is it so important, Ting? Joy is shooting a TV show. I have to accompany her there. So, my tryouts aren't important? How do you know I'm not sexy? Sexy? I don't see it. Is this sexy enough? I wish I was there. Everything we worked so hard for is now destroyed. I didn't mean to do it. Stripping for a boy on the internet? You didn't mean to? You're the worst. You destroyed Joy's dream and mine. You destroyed our family. All you care about is Joy. You wanted her to be famous. Didn't you? You made Joy die. Joy almost killed me. My legs are like this because of her. We're not moving anywhere. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! You did the same thing to Joy, didn't you? You're the one who made her die. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Don't! Joy. I'm sorry. I'll never leave you again. I'll always be with you. Mom! Why are you crying? I want to be with you. But I don't want you to cry. When you're happy, I'm happy too. I love you, mom. I have to go now. -Joy! Joy! -Mom! -Mom! -Joy! Mom! Joy is dead, mom. Don't leave me, mom. If you're gone, how am I gonna live? I love you, mom. I WANT TO DIE Mom! Open the door for me, mom! All the things I did for you, do they mean nothing to you? Next week, I have to go study abroad. My dad arranged everything. Don't look so serious. I'll be back soon. You look pretty in this outfit. I expected a sexy look. This outfit reminds me of my grandma. How do you know I'm not sexy? Hey. What's wrong? Promise me, we'll be friends forever. Of course. What's wrong? The casting agent called. -They chose you! You got it! -Really, mom? Prepare your portfolio. I'll go talk to your principal. Portfolio? For the scholarship. If you get it, it'll help with your celebrity career. Don't worry. I'll take care of everything. Who is Singh? -Give it back! -Is he your boyfriend? -Give my phone back! -Tell me! Answer it! Answer it! Answer it! Answer it! Answer it! -Hello? -Hello, it's me, Singh. -Remember me? -Yeah. What's your friend's name? What's wrong with you? This is my number. I'm Singh. Joy!
