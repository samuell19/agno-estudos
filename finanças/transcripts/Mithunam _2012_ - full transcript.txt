This is radio station, Hyderabad centre, lndian year of 1934, 28th day of Bhadrapada month! 2012 AD, September 19! Wednesday morning! We greet our listeners on the occasion of Lord Ganesh's festival. You look exactly like a monkey! Get down! You called me a monkey, so l'll come down only if you offer me a fruit. Fruit? l'll beat you with a mud piece! You'll put soap nut liquid into my eyes. Thank God, you didn't say l'll season you! Get down, my man! Troubling me on festival day! Get down! May you live long enough with blessings of mother and mother-in-law... Still? Having 25 children... - This is good! No shame at all! - Watch out! Still it's good! Good, it'll be good... Do it slowly, l may lose remaining hair too! My head isn't a vessel! lt's bitter. - That's why l told you shut your mouth. lt's wonderful! Mischievous like a child! Pour water! Hot...it's very hot! - Hot? Take it. Eye...wound! Take fruit! Where's the pomegranate leaf? - lt's there only! Where's the leaf? Always troubles me, all leaves are for God, right? Leaves ring to my memory, add few leafy vegetables. You've 3 brinjals cut yesterday, right? Historians say old brinjals are good for chutney than fresh ones. Offer prayers! Lady's fingers and brinjals won't go anywhere. How come curry leaves are here? Use fresh curry leaves for soups! lt must fall into the soup directly from the tree. Not into well, right? Just because you've stock, don't add too much of coriander! Coriander must be like rhythm of Tanpura in the brinjal chutney. You woke me up early morning! Despite my warning, you gave me a oil bath! l'm dying with hunger, didn't have a drop of water since morning. you're feeding the bulls first! Not bull but cow! lt's sin, repent! He's like that, is it tasty? lf you're hungry, you'd eat few extra morsels. Clarified butter! - Pour! Excellent! Delicious like nectar. Taste isn't in the thing but in your hands! May the food giver live happily! - May you digest all the food! Betel leaves! Get it yourself. You lazy woman! Great! You made the plant to sprout betel punch! You're not an ordinary woman! You're a bit...lady! Bloody bitch! Useless boy! Never let others to live in peace. Donkey! What chutney is it? - Coriander! Bland! l know, coriander will not do for you. You want hot and spicy! Add chili powder! Did you feel the heat on tasting what you sniffed little earlier? You're taking revenge on me. l'm avenging for missing Draksharamam proposal. lf l had married him, l wouldn't be toiling like a beast here, l would be sleeping like a queen on the silk bed! What's here other that the smell of snuff powder? l feel burning sensation in stomach. Have some more chili powder! You've medicine, right? 1, 2, 3... 5! How are children? They are ruling the world like 5 Pandavas! What do they lack? They're doing fine! Don't have the chance of speaking to them on phone. What can you speak to them? Night falls here and day breaks for them there! Anyway you get a call from them every week, right? They're visiting us once in every 2 or 3 years. Phones they bought are dead! Things beyond our reach are always more beautiful! Strange humans who snap bonds! Attached detachment! They should yearn for us, why should we yearn for them? l feel like to eat something, Where's the mango jelly bar? Not anywhere else, it's right beside me. Don't know when you get up at night for what! Our eldest son loves mango jelly bar! People live according to their tastes. Though they're our children, we mustn't be dependent on them. Where we are destined to get air and water... lt's God's wish! God's wish? Not mango jelly bar! Pluck flowers, my friend... l've to visit temple... Tender like you... Beautiful like you... Flowers... Disturbing sleep is as sinful as disturbing penance. Fools don't have the sense of time. Stop it, you fool! l'm grandpa here! lndeed 'Appadam' grandpa! l told your father, mother and sister, l'm telling you again. Don't call me as and when you wish! There's a day every week, right? Call on that day only! l'll kill you! l'll not show mercy because you're my youngest grandson. Cut the call! This is Akashavani radio station, now poetry recital! Now let's listen to Jonnavithula Ramalingeswara Rao's Coffee hymn! Coffee every morning gives real kick... lts big trouble if we miss it a day... lt's sheer luck to get a good cup of coffee... Nectar is humbug, my dear men... O coffee! You're one of a kind drink in all the worlds... That's why l tie you up in my mouth... Raise slogans of praise with our tongue every morning... O mother of taste, don't make me scold wife for an early morning bed coffee... Fresh coffee...Nescafe...bless us with your divine taste, Brook Bond... Loved by world over...life giver... May you flow in every home every hour, O Goddess of hot beverage... The aroma of you dripping down in the steel filter is really deadly... A little of it can bring back the dead to life... Missing you for a day ruins the day with cranky behaviour... That's why they get you urgently... They bring and keep safely to prepare... And wait patiently till it is served... The serve a frothy coffee by pouring it from one cup to another... Even men from traditional families go to have a cup of Barista coffee... They get disappointed if the shop is closed... l seek refuge in you, O Goddess Coffee! Fabulous! What son? No problem, carry on. He's having coffee, he'll be in a trance. He won't come out of it for an hour. lt seems elder one has gone to San Francisco, did he tell you on phone? Who is she? Granddaughter of aunt Subbulu! The girl who is named after me, it seems she gave a dance performance in Tata conference... Not Tata? CAT? Not even that? What's it then? DATS? Damn it! That's it! Telugu people split up into 3 in a day! Something is boiling on stove, wait. Gravy is boiling! Centrum? No need, son. He never uses English medicines. Get something for my knee pain. Grandson? Does he want to talk to me? ln Telugu? No? Let him talk! Yes, grandma only! Grandpa is having coffee. lf he hears your Telugu, he'll kill you. Will you make a cartoon film on your grandpa? Does my husband look like a cartoon orjoker to you? Hey you...call your father! Are you cooking everyday or eating frozen food? What's the time now there? Go to sleep. Okay, she's fine, right? Tell her l had inquired. Bye! One must have attached detachment! What's the use of getting too attached with parents like your mother? Did your mother or father ever come to see you? Did you ever think about them? What's this? Why are you washing my sari? You wash my dhoti, is it wrong if l wash your sari? Moreover when l wash, squeeze or dry your sari, wonderful, l'm overwhelmed by feelings! Enough! Every man has BP and diabetes like God's discus and conch! Why won't he get affected? Look at you! You draw water from well early morning, sweep the courtyard, make motifs, cook, wash clothes, grind batter, do all the household work, why would you get affected by ailments? Hold it! There's a switch for water, cooking, switch for making chutney or batter, leave it! Getting lazy to put the switch, there's a remote switch now! At an age when young should be able to digest stones, they're eating a handful of tablets, what bloody times have come! This sari was brought by Govind. l couldn't sleep well when you went out of station. l would sleep using your sari as bedspread. You'd appear in the sari l used! ln my dream! Look, Kistappa is bearing fruit for every leaf! Wonderful! Look at Madhava, isn't he taking good care of us? Look, how he has taken the responsibility on his shoulders. Govind too hasn't forgotten the elders! Look, he too wants to provide us support! Hubby! When l see these flowers, it makes me remember Meenakshi. She loves these flowers. People used to think we were sisters. Such a long plait, big eyes! Are you listening? She loved, married him and went away to Kharagpur. Don't know how she is doing now? Oh God! She didn't make it to our youngest son's marriage too. Did you see how nicely l've made the garland? lsn't it? Meenakshi would've done it much better. Take it, offer it to your God. Your comb my hair once in 12 years, yet... You get to know whatever l think! That's the problem l've with you. Comb properly. Fragrant like Goddess Parvathi's hair. l've added fragrant roots and hibiscus flowers to the hair oil. lt adds fragrance. Leave it... what do you lose if l compare? Shouldn't there be a limit to compare? Comparing me with Goddess herself! You're a Goddess to me. Goddess or Ankalamma? He's back again! - Please calm down! Childishness! - My foot childishness! You're too much! Why are you after my home like bad luck? What happened now? lt seems you're telling everyone that Appadas is growing garlic plants in home. My will and wish, l'll grow canabis if not garlic. Will you behead me for that? l'll kill you, silly boy! You shut up! l'll kill if you come here again, donkey! Useless donkey! l'll kill you! - Please calm down. Don't be childish like them. - Who is child? Are we going to trouble others? We're living n our own without anyone seeing us. Why is he banging the door, bloody... What happened now? He saw me combing your hair from the door's hole, he told everyone that old man is combing grandma's hair. Just comb her hair, l'll give her a bath too! l'll do anything, she's my wife and my will! No control on your tongue! You talk as you like, stubborn man isn't bothered about others hearing it. You were a teacher too! Moreover have 3 Masters Degrees! What's the use? No control on emotions! You talk about self control! No use of those useless meditations and Yogas! Anger is one's enemy, patience is one's protection! Correct, l got the poem but can't grasp the essence of it. Though you're a cow, won't you butt if l pinch your tail? This is Akashavani radio station, in today's program of classical music, we're listening instrumental music! Percussions by Dr. Yella Venkateshwara Rao and Nemani Somayajulu, Fabulous! Two! l'm going up the ladder to top! Great! Up the ladder again! Lord, bless me another big leap! Gone! l think Lord heard you, he gave a kick to take you down! Get down! Get down further, that's it! Hey look there! A parrot is eating the tender mango beautifully! lt's a squirrel not a parrot! l can see clearly the red beak and green body! No, it's a squirrel. l can see clearly the 3 lines drawn by Lord Rama, it's a squirrel. You moved my coin! Cheating game! l'll not accept this! l don't have the necessity to play cheating games. lf you cheat women, you'll go to hell. She-devils and vultures would besiege you there! lt's my mistake to play with a cheater like you. You got cheated, my dear! Did you add stones of mango? My left eye was battering as a sign of bad omen. l knew there's an impending danger! When the gravy is boiling, it must be like churning of sea of milk! When seasoning, it must be like first rain and create a storm in the cup! Must be like my death anniversary! Family life and gravy gets tastier as it simmers! Buchi, remember well! Don't just sprinkle asafetida in dishes, use it in good measure, it must be at least the size of a big bead! lt'll be fabulous! Vow of silence l'm dead! ls it auspicious Ekasi day? l can't understand you and you can't... l'm saying everything is fine and okay! Nothing else! What? Am l like a cow? Do l eat grass and drop cow dung? Do you want me to sleep in backyard? You want me to milk the cow! Will you make pudding with cow's milk? She's looking angry, it means she'll make tamarind rice. lf she asks for milk, she'll make pudding! Thank God, my head would've broken into two pieces. Savithri, weekly one day she takes vow of silence. But why do we fight always? l got it. You listen to me without a protest. But l don't listen to what she says, right? That's the difference. Do you've sense? What's the time now? Noon! What's this silly cry at noon? You're becoming like Appadas! l couldn't sleep last night. Loose motions! You eat whatever you can lay your hands on. Can't you keep control on your food intake? How? When l see cashew nuts... Then, eat few leaves of mint and few grains of pepper. Pepper? lt's hot! You won't let earthworms survive in rains, you won't let butterflies to fly in spring, in summer, you eat vegetarian and non-vegetarian! Same cry again! Shut your mouth and have a digestive juice! The moment l sleep, he's up to something! What's that? What happened? You're bleeding! Please bear it. l said bear it, please hold it. A little turmeric powder will heal it. God! Don't shout! Bear the pain! Did you hurt your leg too? - lt fell! Won't l give you ask me? Stolen jaggery and kisses are sweeter, you've to experience it to understand. Then, enjoy it! Kiss is for the jaggery not to wife! Shameless man! This is little personal. Okay? Okay? Think about God, it's good! Always chanting names of sons! They too were named after Gods! You gave them the names. l thought you'd have 1 or 2 children, so l named the eldest as Krishna. You gave birth to a son every year, so l took to the chant of God to name them. Did a great job! Calcium! Am l man or wall? lt's burning. When Meenakshi did this in our marriage, it didn't burn but was cool. Wives are always cheap to husbands! Wash it or else it may burn! l entered the garden early morning to get flowers for your prayers, Lord. The garden was shining bright in the morning sun! Flowers were playing happily in the mother's lap! Then... l stood near a plant with flowers... Bending down a branch... Seeing this horror... flowers were horrified... Cried with tears rolling down asking will you take our lives? Hubby! - What? Please take out pickles from the jar! - Okay! Pickles get tastier as it soaks. Coconut to eat! Coconut? Yes. - Fabulous! Why did you remove the ladder asking me get pickles? Will you let me make chutney with coconut? You silly woman, get the ladder! Will you bring or shall l rip out your skin? Why are you behaving silly like Keti in puppet show? Sit silently. What about your silly acts, Bangarakka? Get the ladder. - No way! Today you'll die in my hands. Let the sin of killing a woman affect me, may l go to the hell! This will happen! - Enough of empty threats! You're not coming down till l grate coconuts. You'll be born as dog in next life. ls this life any better than that? lf l jump from here... You're not a Leo! You belong to Aries! Cheating runs in your family! Your father is a cheat! He promised many things but gave just a nose pin for marriage. As if yours is Harishchandra's family! They promised Rs.500 cash and 5 sovereigns of gold, but got just 3 sovereigns of gold only! Moreover it has 3 grams of lac! Don't grind as you wish, grind it softly. Grind it little more. Check if salt stone is ground or not. Add pulse! Fry it perfectly. Only on occasions, never made any offering to God. Don't know how the sins would affect me. Don't do injustice to me and that chutney. Will it be more that what you did to me? Had that Draksharamam proposal been materialized... Golden waist belt, 6 pairs of bangles, they promised a chain too! They didn't want a penny as dowry! One must be lucky to enjoy life! No use of thinking now. Fabulous! l feel like l'm at the threshold of heaven! Your hands create magic! Look at the holy discus and conch with holy mark in between. Your eyes have a problem, that's why you see holy marks! Ammi, you tolerate abuses but not praise. You always make pots and covers only! You've forgotten to make lamps. l would've finished offering 1 lakh lamp prayer. l told you a lakh times. You wanted to offer prayers for 16 benefits. l arranged it. Then, you said another special prayer, l said okay. You gave vermillion of every one in the village. l said okay to any prayer you wanted to offer. But 1 lakh lamp... - Again 1 lakh lamp. lt's bad omen for us. First we planned it, your mother fell sick. Second time we fixed the day and my father died. lf you tlk about it, someone would die!- Silent! Don't talk about bad things. Don't connect those two things. You're lazy to make lamps. Don't say like that. Didn't l make thousands of lamps when you asked and stored it inside? You put everything l say in backburner. Whatever you say l'll carry it on my head. Don't argue like a foolish woman. Yes, l'm foolish, you're a great man! No, can you understand what l am saying! Go away! - You go away! Mad man! Go! Savithri! Who is greater in nature? Man or woman? ln my opinion man is great, what about you? l got it. So little like goat milk. - That's why they say cow's milk. Did you drink while milking it? Thank God! Goat's milk makes me remember Mahatma Gandhi! That great man got us freedom with little goat milk and few ground nuts. l think l was studying in class lV, Gandhi came to Rajahmundry, we planned to visit and made cotton cloth using hand weaver! Piercing through the crowd in railway station, do you know how did l reach him? l couldn't get the opportunity to garland him, but l got the opportunity to touch his holy feet! When l think of touching his feet, even today it thrills me! Really a great man! Like Einstein said this generation may not believe Gandhi lived in this country. You and Gandhi have many similarities! lf we remove your love for food. Love letter? Love letters for us? ls it electricity bill? Pay it before due date, if not he'll cut the power. What happened to you? Looks like you've slipped! Don't feel shy, it's natural to enjoy life! How nice the unripe mangoes are! Let's make pickles, pluck! Pluck! Shall l? l'll pluck it. Pluck! Catch it. No...no... - Catch it. l'm dead! l thought you'll be weightless but heavy like a dead calf! Even a towel would be heavy in old age. Okay, get up. - No need! You wantonly put me down. Don't l know your mischief? Get up...get up.... - l've broken my leg. lt's burning! lt's burning! Please bear it, you rush for everything. Am l? Wait...sit! Dew! Searching for me already! - Just now? You went long back! l was invited for a function, you won't let me go out of house if you're awake. You stand guard like demoness Lankini! Did you bring my share of pulse? - They gave a lot! Season it for tonight. Can't digest it at night. Come...come... Oh l got you Ardhanareeswara! l searched for you separately! Are you both in one place? Buchi, when l wrote a letter about my husband's death, l can't forget the way you reacted to it, after that sending money every year for my son's education, he got ajob in campus selection, he wants to seek your blessings personally, please bless him, you've been helping me a lot, your husband who is allowing you to do it without a protest, you both are like Gods to us, how am l to repay the gratitude... Always your friend Meenakshi! lts easy to born as humans, but difficult to live like humans. Wake up O sun! The horizon is turning red! Why are you toiling like this? Like a man of many trades! l'll clean cotton and you criticize me. Please come here for a moment. Come l say! - Coming! l'm here! Look there! How beautiful the butterfly is! Do you want it? - l told you to see. l can't just see, if you point a finger, l'll do it. Hold this. Come children... To hear little, small, short, smart stories... Butterfly! That's okay! But where's your dhoti? Hubby! - What happened? Rope is cut! lt was brought when we were newly married. We had an angle, right? - No need of it! Hubby! Hubby! Are you there? Hubby! - What? We got this amulet for Govind when he was 7 years old. Amulet with Lord Anjaneya! Good torchlight, fell into well and got rusted. Will it work? Look here! Silver ring with Goddess Lakshmi! lt belongs to Kesava, he tied thread to tighten it, poor boy! Offering dispenser! Crow might have picked and dropped into well. Whose milk dispenser is this? May be Madhava's second son's. He would've thrown it into well for giving him castor oil. Whose is that? - Who else? Yours! Shameless man! This is to cover shame, right? There's a limit for fun! This is your third granddaughter's who is named after you Buchi Lakshmi! Now l remember! l got it made by Poli Shetty! Now l've a real surprize for you! Show me! When you came here as my newly wedded wife, l brought this from Chennai Vummidiars for you! l know, you got this to know where l am like belling a cat! Mischievous ideas! l got it to see you move around the home like an angel. lt's best to do this job which gives returns! Look, unripe bananas! How far your cooking has come? You want any help? Why will you not? - Prepare this too. Always troubles me. Always after food! lt means rains produce food! Food is very important to the world, right? lt means food is manifestation of God! Buchi, first morsel of food to me is like Lord Shiva! l'll consecrate it with water! l'll put a dot with pickle! l'll offer coriander garland! Offer mashed pulse! Lastly l'll cleanse it with curd and unite it with my soul. lt's salutations and obeisance to me. That is devotion and that is food! lt seems God writes the names of eaters on the banana leaf. When we are born, he signs a document of how many one has in his or her life! Once a man completes his quota of leaves, what's left? Earth! But number is secret! Myth of time! Take it! Savoury! Take 25%! Have it. One for you, one for me. - Give! Look! This brings to memory about our marriage band! Why not? He played in our marriage. We almost made a Himalayan effort to get him paid a rupee. Don't talk too much, your people were not any less stingy. They promised 7 day marriage but finished on fourth day with 7 feasts. On the day your people arrived, they said they'll eat only once, said next day is Saturday and would be fasting, did you eat less? Two large vessels of tamarind rice, two big bowls of ginger chutney were sent to the guest house. l swear we didn't get a chance to wash the vessels too! Finished four pots of buttermilk. Not only that we sent half acre of plantains in a bullock cart, You didn't even leave the banana peels! Cooking was like good medicine! Your people served ghee with grass! My father said that's more than enough for your people. Do you know about 5 jewels in cooking? Brinjal delicacy, leaf vegetable, pumpkin with pulse...- Jack fruit mash! Plantain gravy, l know all that. l've heard it millions of times in these 50 years. With your grace though l didn't get to wear diamond rings, the holes still remain! Why are you speaking nasty things without considering your age? Nasty things? Nasty things? You're sprinkling pesticide, cover your face! lt kills humans easily but not the insects. lt was flowering well, somebody cast evil eyes on it. Then, keep a scarecrow to ward off evil eyes. No need of scarecrow to ward off evil, Buchi! lf you stand here for an hour every evening letting down your hair, forget about insects, not even birds would dare come near. Marrying you would make me a scarecrow, what else can l be? l was very beautiful as a little girl. carrying this demon, l've become like Seetha in Lanka. Enough of your taunt. Taunt? Forget about birds, not even ghosts and evil spirits would dare come here, Appadas. Hey you Lankini, have you made me a scarecrow? Didn't you feel when you told to go forest? Wait, l'll take you to task. - What will you do, man? l'm leaving! l'm leaving! l'm giving up world to become a Sanyasi! Delighted to hear! l'll never step into this home again in my life. l'm saved! So be it! My heart is burning for making fun of me. My entire body is burning, who am l to complain? lnsult! l'm leaving home forever! l don't know anymore Sanskrit, if you want, leave happily! Your behaviour is making me go furious! Pesarattu is fantastic! No wife, no children...no home... These wooden sandals are worse than a devil like wife. l'll throw it! This is happy! lngratitude beast! Can't you hear me? Why would you bother about my sorrow? Generation gap! Had it been your mother, where is she? Where is it? There's a generation gap between us too! Thorn! Looks like it has entered deeply! Wait...wait... l'll remove it, just a minute. Pesarattu! - Feed! Fabulous! l've told many times but Anji is eating off the plants! l've told my children only one thing, if your childhood is difficult, you'd live happily all life, if your childhood is happy, wait l say! lf your childhood is happy, you'd spend rest of life with difficulties. Advice Anji! Hubby! - What? Anji is missing since morning. Anji is missing... Dear! Where's your child? Where did you go away, dear? Coming...coming! Where's our Anji? Relationships are short lived! Mother, delivery date of your daughter-in-law has been given. Your grandson has sent a cartoon film, watch it. Tale of Appadam grandpa's stomach! As soon as grandpa gets up early morning, one spoon of honey and little lime juice, then breathing exercise for some time, l mean Pranayama, after that breakfast! Four idlies with coconut chutney, four vadas with ginger chutney, with ghee and chili powder, then one jar full of filter coffee, little rest, this isn't a factory siren, it's siren of grandpa's stomach, it means lunch time! lt's lunch time! Menu, first copiously mashed pulse, next is brinjal dish, then Dappalam with four appalams, then, finally top it with curd and mango stone! Finish it with sweets and betel leaves! A commercial break! lt means grandpa takes a nap! One getting up at 4 pm, two corns or four Pootharekulu, and then a very hot cup of tea, then he gives a small gap, after listening to news on radio, one dibbarotte with honey sweetened drink, or tamarind rice with pickle, along with ajug of cow milk, then two bananas and two spoons of... the quota may double or go triple also. Poor stomach would go burst at such times! Delivery date of Madhava's wife has been announced, he wants me there. Go. - Come means us both! Let's go, come! Cooking and eating, is life that's all? No visits to holy places or to see new places! Let's go to see Hollywood and Disneyland, come. He's not calling to take you around America, To become a midwife to his wife and do all the chores. Both husband and wife would go to office, you've to take care of the new born, no need to tell all that. l'll do it, is it wrong? Blood relationship! You're the root! They say old gives way to new. Old is not always good and new isn't always bad. lt was said by Kalidas not Appadas. Get me that box. We used to get letters for obsequies of any dead. We used to sprinkle turmeric water to accept telegrams. Whether it is good news or bad news. But just a button will get us to hear and see them! Though children are not here, they're before our eyes. This is communication. We used to work hard physically to grind, pound or grate, then came grinder for your idlies, mixie for your chutneys, gas for our cooking! l'm little happy for using all these implements. This is relaxation. That's why your mother died cooking using a firewood stove. So, please respect the old and welcome the new! Tell me the truth, when l speak to children secretly over cell phone, didn't you eavesdrop our conversation and wipe tears? Did l say anything wrong? Got any of your old slippers? Cockroaches are damaging the clothes, get few naphthalene balls. Take it. - Give. Why have you opened the cloth shop? Not a shop, do you know what it is? - What?- See! Our marriage dress. My mother presented it. Presented by eldest son on sixtieth birthday. Wait! What are these? No need to see, my saris. Men don't know about it...why..? Peacock neck colour! You came here in this sari. l thought you were like a Goddess. You wore this sari when you got pregnant with our first child. Yes. This is when we poured berries on our younger son, we were fighting like children with children for the coins, you pinched me too, you wore this sari that day! When l was accepting President's award, unable to bear the happiness, you were in tears ofjoy, you were in this sari that day! You were giving this to vessel seller, l had a fight with you and hid these two saris! Mine...absolutely mine! When l got operated for appendicitis, you came running to hospital in anxiety, you were wearing this sari that day. When our children celebrated sixtieth birthday, you wore this sari that day! When retired and came home very sad, you hugged and wiped my face with this sari! Enough? All are different, Appadas is different. Keep your leg here. - Why? We get good slippers for Rs.100. Not for money, my dear silly wife! There's happiness in making it ourselves. l'm a retired man! Retired doesn't mean stop working. Stop doing routine job! Keep your feet here, keep! Wait! - Keep here! Good! You try to do everything yourself and raise my tension! lt could be a scorpion or some poisonous insect. What if it gets serious? ls it painful? l know hymn to reduce scorpion bite's effect. Please... Got any relief? - Got a little relief, teach me that hymn, if it bites again, l'll use it myself. The hymn will not work if you do it yourself. There's a condition too! Teach me, l can use it for others. l don't know any hymns, l just prayed to Lord Venkateswara. What did you pray? To give your pain to me. lf l die before you, how would it be? Am l that lucky? Damn lady! So you're waiting for my death, right? Why are you asking such questions then? Sleep without talking. Death is inevitable! Early or late, that's all! Okay, think if you die before me. - l'm saved! l don't have to work anymore. lf you go to heaven alone, won't l follow you in the next flight? Won't you let me be happy there also? Though it is heaven, how can you spend time without me? lsn't there a way for us to go together? Why not? See! l'll see how he can take us separately. Mad man! Buchi's man! Good companion and good shade! Your madam becoming my wife is fruit of my previous birth's good deeds. Father! Nothing, l had to call under unavoidable circumstances. Tell me. You know Seetharamamurthy uncle's son, l mean who was named after you as Appadas Hariprasad, and aunt Venkaya's granddaughter, l mean who was named after mother, we decided to get them married in lndia in our home before you both, if you say yes, all of us would come to lndia next month, l mean to get your blessings. l'll discuss with mother and tell you. Call me tomorrow. Really? l'm extremely happy! Again 5 sons, daughters-in-law, grandchildren, it'll be fun and frolic for 10 days here! What else did he say? He said he'll fix a date and come to lndia. He's superstitious like you. l'll start making sweets and savouries. lt hasn't dawned yet! lt's 3 am now lf it's 3 am here, what's the time there? Afternoon! Sleep for another hour. l can't sleep anymore. At least lie down! lf he calls again, l'll talk to him. Okay. Our Buchi is marrying that boy... Buchi marrying that boy... Buchi is marrying Appadas. Buchi is marrying Appadas! True! We'll be as happy as seeing our marriage again. How about bride wearing my marriage sari? How can l accept if someone else wears your sari? Let be granddaughter or some queen! Buchi is Buchi and sari is sari! Buchi is Buchi! Pickle belongs to us... Gongura chutney too is ours... Why do we need pizzas, burgers and pasta? Coconut chutney for idlies... Ginger chutney for pesarattu... Honey sweetener for dibbarotte... if you don't get it, use jaggery... Hot milk pudding must be eaten fresh and tamarind rice the next day... Chilly bajji must burn the tongue... Vada must float in curd... Relish 25 mouths full of brinjal delicacy... Lick the leaf clean if it is pumpkin gravy... When jack fruit is in home, it's obsequies for the dead elders... Many a generations ate happily making a delicacy of mashed jack fruit... Gurazada said one who eats well gets stronger... Appadas followed that in letter and spirit to eat three times a day... l'm Dollar Dakshinamurthy! Didn't recognize me? Father of your second daughter-in-law! Are you fine? l don't get time to visit you. You don't have the patience to come there. As my NRl poet friend said, after reaching the land of dreams, would motherland appear in dreams, mother? That's why unable to bear anymore, l came here, mother. l want to eat from your hands and sleep in your lap. What's there in lndia? Cow dung and donkey's egg! l mean cow dung and donkey's egg! lf you board AlR lndia flight, before air hostess gets your coffee, we'll reach America. Play with children in between, if there's time, have a coke. Father-in-law, you get cow dung and donkey's egg in any country. What do we get here? Affection, love! Above all mother is here! Eat well son! Come children, mother is serving pickle rice. Not for him, first me, mother! Why did it happen like that? Not serious, right? Just broke the leg. How long he'll be in hospital? Minimum a month, that's why postponed the marriage by 2 months. Forget about marriage, health is more important. Convince mother somehow! - She'll kill you. You should've seen her enthusiasm. She has made many boxes of sweetmeats. She may be shocked to hear this. l'll mange it, son. Why don't you both come here after 2 months? l don't have any objections, but your mother never steps out of this home. You know about her, right? Don't put the blame on mother. Are you ready to come? Allow us to be here only! What happened? Flight delay or is there any change in the program? lt seems he hurt his leg. l picked up the phone. Leave it. lt'll happen when it is destined to happen! lt's God's will! You toiled hard to prepare things. Leave it, l did it for my husband! Have it! Let's both have it. What's the special today? Nothing, just sweets and savouries only! Few fruits and a glass of milk. Today is Saturday! Morning you made bitter gourd gravy, right? No need to eat left over, moreover today is Saturday. Tamarind rice and bitter gourd gravy are tasty next day only! Will you lose anything if you fast for a day? Bitter gourd has medicinal qualities. lt kills worms in stomach. lt is blood purifier and averts skin diseases. Leave me! lt's there, get it yourself. l'm fasting, serve yourself. What a taste! Heavenly! lt's heaven before me! Fabulous! Chew the leaf also along with food. You can reach heaven with body! lf God of Death Yama comes here now, who is he? Markandeya! lt seems he held the Lord Shiva in phallus form! l'll hold this vessel with gravy, if l smear a little gravy on Yama's tongue, forget about taking me with him, he'll sit to me and eat like a gargantuan! What are you eating? l'm not mad after food like you. lf l say only fruits l mean it. See! What's that? Black ammonite stone? Grapes! Your eyes have a problem. Useless fruit! l hate that name also. What did this fruit do... Does it bring to your memory Draksharamam proposal? You'll lose nothing, have few grapes. How dare you throw those nasty fruits into my food! l hate grapes and Draksharamam. lt's bad omen while eating. Bad omen! Will you wash hands in food? Can you get food again in this life? That Draksharamam proposal... - Broaching about that proposal again! Yes, if you had accepted that Draksharamam proposal, your bad time would've ended, maybe he would've decked you with jewels and took you around on elephant, you're going through hell here with me, l denied you the life of an empress! Even after l've told you this, you're still eating those nasty fruits! Why are you kicking food? Not kick, l'll strangle and kill you. Kill me. - l'll kill you. Die...die... - Kill me... lt'll be good riddance! Kill me. - l'll kill you. l'll hack you! - Get lost! Who won now and who lost, Lord? Couple means tiffs...it's always sweet... Two instruments making sound but the rhythm is one... An old man with young heart is running... A sixty year old woman is angry... Two hearts are beating but the rhythm is one... Throwing aside the differences... Shedding tears, they laughed together... lt's raining, get up and sleep inside. Get up...get up... Get up! 104! Get up! Have little food! Throw up! l'm feeling cold! Legs are paining! Buchi, open your mouth, have little! l don't want. - Please have little. God! Fortunate woman! Dying as a married chaste woman! May you live long as married... be blessed with long life! At last you made me offer the 1 lakh lamp prayer. You're glowing like Goddess Lalitha Parameshwari! l got the best life partner even God wouldn't have been so lucky. As you said it would've been good if you'd accepted that Draksharamam proposal. You married this lifelong poor man! Did l give you any pleasure in life? Bloody life! Please calm down! What do l lack? l want only you in all my lives! l'm telling you now, there wasn't any proposal from Draksharamam! No Draksharamam proposal? Really? What a good news! Bloody bit... No Draksharamam proposal! There's no proposal from Draksharamam! Lord, it seems there wasn't any proposal from Draksharamam! Just one Rama and one Seetha, that's all! Hey Draksharamam! You're a fake! You're a fake! Draksharamam proposal was a fake! Draksharamam proposal was a fake! Your madam is a bloody bit... Draksharamam proposal was a fake! Draksharamam proposal was a fake! Why are you still sleeping? Hubby! Birth is game... death is game... Love in between is game for you... Relationship is game... rivalry is game... End is game for you... Game is black and white... Victory of black and white is a game for you... Earth is game...Sky is game... You play the game keeping me in mystery... lt's a game, right Lord Shiva? lt's a game, right, Kesava? l was scared l would die first. Now a big burden has eased! lt's over! Had l died first, you may pour turmeric water on me, God, you know he would've struggled to live! First take him and think about me later. l used to pray you every day! Don't think will there be foolish wives who would wish death of their husbands? There will be! l love him to death! He's scared of darkness. He's afraid of thunders. He's afraid of lightning. lf he wakes up at midnight with hunger, who would prepare food for him? Who would fulfill his silly wishes? Son? Daughter-in-law? Grandson? Or you? Answer me! We merged like gold and lac. Gold is gone! Lac remains as residue!
