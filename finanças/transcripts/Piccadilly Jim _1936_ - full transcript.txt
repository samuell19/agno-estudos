Mr. Jim, sir. Mr. Crocker, sir. Mr. Jim, sir. that noise. Oh, that was the wood dub, sir. Or perhaps you'd prefer the yellow billed grackle. Does it, Bayless? We never have any trouble rousing you these days, do we, sir? Oh, why did I ever tell you that I couldn't sleep in the country? Of course, I've never heard you're American, Bird, sir, but my little representations of our English varieties seem to do the trick. Oh, Bayless, the Brooklyn boys are holding a mass meeting right in the middle of my head. Give me five minutes more. Oh, but, sir, you instructed me to wake you at the crack of dusk. Has it cracked? Oh, definitely, sir. Here are the telephone calls we have received. At 9.15, Mr Jennings from the newspaper asking for your caricature of the Prime Minister. At 10.12, an invitation from the Duchess of Chatterson, lunch and Thursday. At 10.18, Mr Jennings from the paper asking for your caricature of the Prime Minister. At 10.22, the solicitor of Mr Horace Magg MP, saying he will institute libel proceedings for your drawing in the London Gossip. Oh, I stand it. At 10.38, Mr Jennings. At 10.40, a rather puzzling message from a Mr Bill Macon. I must remind you that you are going to town tonight. That's right. Yes, but you are in town, sir. Don't heckle me. No, sir. At 10.51, you'll tailor some new samples. At 11.05 Mr. J called again. I take it he wants that caricature. Well you'll find it in the inside pocket of my dress code. I did it on the back of a menu last night. Yes sir. And now we can dispense with the reading of the minutes. Very good sir. But your, your father's here in the studio sir. My father? Isn't that a little previous? I don't get my check from the paper until Saturday. He said it was a matter of some moment, sir. Oh, well, maybe he's got a job. That might be it, sir. I see they are putting on a new melodrama at Bentham's. Melodrama, Bayless? My father is a Shakespearean actor. He plays Shakespeare or nothing. In other words, nothing. Oh, that's a pity, sir. Now, Mr. Crocker's such a fine actor, too. My father is not a fine actor. My father is a ham. Ah, but a delightful ham. I mean gentlemen. Eyes look your last, arms take your last embrace, and lips, and oh... You're going to frighten yourself to death doing that someday. You know that, don't you? Well, I mustn't let myself get rusty. Can I mix you a little breakfast? No, no, I've had my breakfast, thank you. I know, ten hours ago. Oh, ahem. Bayliss tells me that you have something of import to impart. Oh, yes. Well, you're busy now. I'll... It's all right. I can do this and listen at the same time. Well, I hope you won't think that I'm an impetuous fool. Well, what have you done now? You will try to understand. Never ferried you yet, have I? No, and heaven knows I have been a trial to you at times. Boys will be boys. Oh, that's very generous of you, James. I don't quite know how to begin. Suppose you begin by telling me her name. Oh, Eugenia. Eugenia Willis. It came like a bolt from the blue, my boy. I'd seen her several times in the waiting room at the dentist. Yes, and she spotted you. Well, you always were a matinee idol, that is, when you had matinees. Well, we met in the lift. It was one of those push... button affairs. She was timid and squealed. We were friends before we reached the street. She was wearing a sable coat. I noticed that. And now she's suing you for breach of promise. Nothing of the sort, my boy. I love her. I want to make her my wife. In view of the sable coat, what is stopping you? It turned out to be her sister's coat. And her sister doesn't approve, nor does her sister's I don't understand that. Anyone should snap at the chance to get you for a brother-in-law. Oh, but you reckon without the pride of the pets. The pets? Yes, Herbert and Nester Pet. They're very rich, my boy. They, uh, they have the imperial ambition. Herbert is the rag king of America. Ah, a musician. No, he has a process. Can't he have it lanced? Oh, you don't understand. Herbert buys clippings from clothing manufacturers and converts them back into cloth again. It's netted in millions, millions. From rags to riches. I repeat, what is the snag? Oh, Mrs. Pett objects to me on the ground of my profession. Well, I'm glad you came to me with this before you got yourself in any deeper. I, who have devoted 40 of the best years of my life to the theater. 20. You haven't worked in the last 20 years. Permit me to remind you that my performance of Osric in the Cedar Rapids... My mistake! My mistake! Six years ago, with outstanding... My mistake! My mistake! Never have I been so humiliated. Not even on tour. Now, that's all right. Now, I can't supply you with a dowry, but if there's anything I can do... Yes, there is, my boy. I've mentioned my son, the distinguished artist. What kind of an artist am I supposed to be? Well, vaguely like Michelangelo. I want them to meet you, my boy. I want them to see what kind of people I come from. Incidentally, I'd like to judge their qualification. Well, apropos of that, I took the liberty of proffering your hospitality. They're coming here tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning? Yeah. I'm not at my bonnie best in the morning. Oh, but we'll see what can be done. Ah. I beg your pardon, sir. Black or white tie tonight, sir? White tie, Bayless. Very good, sir. Aren't you overdoing the nightlife for little James, my boy? Well, you've got to collect types. I've been doing so many caricatures lately, I'm running out of material. Yes, but dissipation... Dissipation isn't helping your technique any, my boy. Thank you. Bad business for the breadwinner. Burning the candle at both ends. That's why I'm going a little bit easy on the morning end. Heh heh. This, however, is rather in the line of duty. Oh, yeah. Heh. Ah, I give you my word. I'm showing an American editor. Bill Macon, the town. I... Oh. Uh... You remember Bill Macon? Uh, oh, yes. Do you think he might give you an advance? I hope so. You'll be needing an engagement ring for... for, uh, Eugenia. Oh, Jim, my boy, that's fine. As, uh, what's-his-name said, now is the winter of our discontent made summer by this... Uh... made summer by this... Ahem. Made, uh... made glorious summer by this son of yore. Well, yes, Bayliss did a bit of a turn on the stage in his youth, you know. Oh, really, Bayliss, you surprised me. Yes, I played Hamlet in Hamlet, Romeo in Romeo and Juliet, and King Lear in... in King Lear, sir. Where? At school, sir. We did the plays both as a tribute to Shakespeare, the immortal bard, and to augment the outing fund. Amateur. Good old black and white, drink it down, drink it down. Good old black and white, drink it down. No, no, listen. Good old black and white, drink it down. You have a very small voice, Mr. Black, but a very unpleasant one. I resent that, Mr. Black. You are swag, Mr. Black. You're tight, Mr. White. You are black, Mr. White. Yes, I'm white, Mr. White. You're black. Oh. You got pretty pretty. So what? Stick to your drinking, Mr. Black. Oh, but you just take one look, Mr. White. I know, I know, I know. She's a pretty girl. I'll take your word for it. So what? She's beautiful. After four drinks, anything is good. Anything is good. Why don't you finish your sentences? I thought you were too absorbed in the lady. Oh, she's with somebody else. You make me very sad, Black. How's that, White? You lack enterprise. Young Lockenvar didn't wait. He grabbed his girl right away from her bridegroom. The days of gallantry are over, I guess. That's not true. Are we mice or are we men? I'll show you who's a mice. Attaboy. Will you have it served here or in the other room, sir? In the other room? Thank you, sir. What a swell place. Oh, I'm so glad you like it. You're an American. How'd you guess? You match. All Americans match. I'm an American. And what do you match? You match your step now. This is for a marriage. Mr. Black, Mr. Black, I'm surprised at you. I thought you would be Mr. White intruding on a lady. Fine business, Mr. Black. Yeah, well, she's an American, Mr. White. And that makes it all the worse. Make a nice little bow. What? A bowed face. Oh. Hey, now you just sit there and brood. I'll take care of this. Splash me a spot, sir? I, uh, I beg your pardon. Ahem. I feel that I should apologize for my friend, Mr. Black. That's quite all right, Mr. White. Oh, no, it's not quite all right. He must be losing his grip. I know he had an inflammable nature, but that's no excuse. Well, shall we just say that he's in wine and let it go at that? I don't think that that's being quite fair to him. We must consider the temptation he had to barge in here. It was something that every man in the room felt. But did the rest of us yield to it? No, sirree. We set the old iron will work we clenched our jaw and we sat tight I should say you're still sitting very tight he makes sense anytime you're ready sir oh thank you yes there is this to be said for poor mr. Black I wouldn't bother mr. White look here look here crickets cricket and square there is this to be said if he had resisted the temptation it would have indicated that the temptation was not so hot I have some crummy old temptations I've been resisting for years Not very flattering, that. I... I understood it was to be only two, sir. Oh, yes. Yeah, that's right. Shall we dance? I'm sorry. I'm afraid my tango's rather bad. By an odd quirk of circumstance, you have at your elbow the finest tango dancer in London. Have I indeed? Perhaps that's not saying enough. In Madrid, when I danced the tango, they took the meter from my taxi and dragged me through the streets. In Sevilla, the week of the bullfights... If I dance with you, Juan, will you go away for good? Word of honor. You mind? Of course not. If you think he's seaworthy. Seaworthy? These are my sea legs and they're hollow. We love you. Have you by any chance formed the wrong impression of me? I think not. You're a typical American, European model. A romantic figure, I trust. Oh, very. I think the technical term is a barfly. Oh. How long have you been over here? Weeks. And you? Years. Uh, who's your friend? Lord Priory. Ah, a title. Mm-hmm. He's nice. I like him. I was afraid of that. What are you doing tomorrow night? Got a date. With his lordship? With his lordship. Tea? Date. Lunch? Date. And breakfast? Date. With? My family. Portrait of a man registering relief. Not the agreement. There you are, Lord Priory. Returned in good condition. Five minutes older, perhaps. Thank you. Oh, how about before breakfast? Got a date. With the? A horse. On the bridle car. It might be the face that launched a thousand ships to burn the topless towers of Ilium. And she's got a date with a horse on the bridle pad. So what? for someone special, Gavinny? Extra special. I might be of help if you describe the party's face. It can't be done. Poets have been trying since the beginning of time and no dice. Oh, an elderly party. Oh, there she is, there she is, there she is. No stone unturned. How about between breakfast and lunch? No. Before tea? You're embarrassing me terribly. I know, but this is serious. I don't even know your name. Good. Good morning, Anne. Good morning. Anne. I thought I'd missed you. Lucy cast a shoe. I had to change horses. Good morning, Lord Priory. Good morning. Well, you came along just in time. Oh, I'm so glad. Should we canter? Let. The, uh, the heat. Man, ah, what is so rare as a day in June, then if ever come perfect. uh... shall we can't have Well, Mr. Crocker, it appears that punctuality is not one of your son's virtues. Oh, well, the artist, Mrs. Pet, you know, the true artist. Incidentally, this true artist doesn't seem to care very much for his own works. Not one to be seen. Yes. Well, the dear boy is the soul of modesty, Mrs. Pett. Away to the museum. He'll be here any minute. He should have been here an hour ago. I shall wait just five minutes more, and that is all. Oh, Nester, please. Don't shout, Eugenia. I begin to look upon this tardiness as a personal affront. Oh, you... Manny! How's that for a hut, John? How dare you! Why's Tony crying to me? Not another word, young man. How can you disfigure such magnificent art? Ah! Call your shots, ma! Ogden, such language! Oh, ma, why don't you be yourself? Go sit in that chair, young man. Oh, golly! Ogden, stop mumbling! Sit down! Properly! Oh, gosh, how can a guy have any foot... suit like this. The boy is perfectly right, Nester dear. Just because we're here in England is no reason he should be made to dress up like a... Herbert, be still. He's my son as well as yours and I have a right... Herbert! Remember where you are. Oh, yes, my dear. It was only a plaster cast, I see. Replace it, my good man, and send the bill to me. Oh, but Mr. Jim would hardly like that, madam. I didn't ask for any comment. No, madam. What are you so engrossed in, Herbert? Funny, look. I failed to see it. But they're the things that most people laugh at. Don't amuse me. Wait a minute. Let me see that. Piccadilly Jim. What's the matter? Don't you see? I do. Mr. Crocker. Yes. Is this by any chance one of the much vaunted works of your son? Yes, so it is. And you said he was an artist. Oh, he is, Mrs. Pett, a very fine artist. He's nothing but a caricaturist. Eminent critics have called him the greatest one of our day. Caricature is not an art. I beg your pardon, madam. You seem to have forgotten Hogarth, Cruikshank and Nast. Well, well... Say nothing of Monnier and Daumier. And for the matter of that Goya... Well, I see no point in remaining here any longer. Well, we haven't seen Mr. Crocker's son. We've seen quite enough of his pinched-back talent. Oh, Mrs. Pet, please, I... Oh, it's all perfectly clear, Mr. Crocker. Your son is nothing but a newspaper hack. Hack? He's tired of supporting you. Oh, no, he isn't. You are looking around for a soft berth. The pet minions would be nice, wouldn't they? Oh, no, no. And you are nothing but a pawn in the game. It's not true, is it James? Well, of course it's slander most foul. Yes. Let me point out, Mr. Crocker, that my sister has not one penny in her own right. Every cent of my not inconsiderable fortune sprang from... The bet process. It's glorious blossom, the reconstructed fabric. It's root, the humble rag. Oh. Iowa speaking, Herbert. As you were part Ogden. Entirely ignoring financial considerations, Mr. Crocker. Any such marriage would be impossible now on account of my niece. Niece, I didn't know you had a niece. Oh, why should you? My niece, Mr. Crocker, is about to ally herself with a nobleman who has the longest lineage in England. I cannot afford, at such a time, to have my sister marry into a family of mountain banks. Oh, Nesta! Then heaven tries the earth as it be in tune, and over it, softly, her warm ear lays. And whether we look, or whether we look... Mr. Jims, shh! We hear life murmur. Or see if... Jim, sir, they're all here. Fine, we are all going to have a little... Oh. James, my boy, allow me. Don't tell me, Father, don't tell me. Well, well, well. Eugenia. Oh, no. You've made a slight mistake, young man. And I judge you need some sleep. Oh, yes, you have made a, this is Eugenia. J, oh, well, now I understand. I look forward to this so much. Oh, not half as much as I have, and it's twice as nice as I expected. You're just being sweet. No, I am not. Father is an awfully nice fellow, but I didn't think he had such good taste. Let me look at you again. Here's for James, my boy. No, we've got to get acquainted. Yes, but I mean... No, I have got to find out whether Eugenia likes oysters or not, how she stands on the subject of bathroom singing, and whether she would rather have a salmon-pure rug than a puppy in the house. I bet she wouldn't. Here's for James, the rest of the family. All right, fine. If you need me, just whistle. Yes, sir. Yes, this is a met quite sufficiently I am pet Yeah pet Hello pet and mr. Pet is the creator of the pet process It's glorious blossom the reconstructed fabric its root the humble rag Nice going old-timer. Oh Yes, and last but not least master Ogden pet. Hello old man. Hi a kid Yes, Ogden's succumbed to the British taste. That's right, my boy, when in Rome... Want to make an issue out of it? Now, wait a minute. I like him a little bit. Ogden! Oh, boy! Now, we're all going to sit down and have a nice little conference about our loved ones. I see no need. Oh, now please sit down. We're just leaving. Oh, Mrs. Pett, if you've got... Don't you speak to me, you fortune hunter! Well, I... No, I... Thank you. Thank you very much. Now, Mr. Pett, will you sit down? Uh, Bayliss, some champagne. Yes, sir. At ten o'clock in the morning? Well, it's just the shank of the evening. Oh, but... Oh, Seriously. Oh dear, that's most unfortunate. Father, impose yourself. We have got to discuss your future, yours and Eugenia's. There will be no such future. What are you, madam, a fortune teller? Any such marriage would be absurd. Name your objections to it, Mrs. Pett. Name them in categorical order. I am prepared to meet them head on. This pair of young people is in love, or should I say are in love. And there is nothing that I wouldn't do to give them their happiness. Nothing. Bravo, sir, bravo. Will that be all, sir? That will be all, Bayliss. You may go and lie down. That is, you may go. And so may we. My good woman. I'm not a good woman, Eugenia. You heard her, don't you? You wouldn't mind a slight delay? Oh, certainly not. You know how it is with the course of true love. Eugenia! I'll fix things up as soon as I can. You darling boy. Eugenia! Goodbye, mother. HOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR And let me say further, my dear Mr. Crocker, that within the past fortnight, your copy has twice been overdue, and once has failed to arrive entirely. Nor has it been up to our usual standard. Do you wish to include the last, sir? No, no, it's no good slinging mud. Take this. Therefore, it is with very great regret that I take this opportunity, occasion, take this occasion to sever our business relationship. Hoping that this will in no way affect our very delightful friendship, I am yours, Mr. President. Hmm hmm hmm. Hmm. What's the point of the wiggle waggle on the end, Bayless? Oh, that's to make it stick, sir. Oh, yeah, becoming quite an expert. It's become necessary, sir, seeing that we are no longer on the paper. Yes, bad business for all of us. Mm-hmm. Oh, I hope my watching you hasn't put you off your form. It's quite an inspiration. Oh, well, I'd hardly say that. I'm not very cheerful company these days. That's only natural, sir. I suppose I should be flattered at my age that the pet family of Whisk Eugenia, I should say Miss Willis, down to the Riviera to get her out of my reach, but confounded I'm not. I know exactly how you feel, sir. It's the same thing with Mr. Jim, only worse. Worse? Why, there's no comparison. Mr. Jim, sir, regards it as an extreme hardship not to know his lady's name nor her whereabouts. Oh, but that's... You can't compare. When Mr. Jim is here, sir, he paces up and down the floor... like a caged lion in a zoo. Yeah. A zoo, if I may say so, sir, where there is no female of the species. Yes, well, that's bad. Venus! Oh, er... Hello! Hello, hello, hello! Hi, Father. A-hunting we will go, a-hunting we will go. I wish we'd do some finding for a change. Oh, no luck? Hope you like your breakfast, sir. Does the larder run to a couple of eggs, Bayless? Oh, yes, sir. As a matter of fact, we have three. Ah, well, scramble them. It sort of stretches them out. Very good, sir. And some coffee, Bayless. Yes, sir. Yeah, well, what about a spot of brandy? Always seems to pick you up. Oh, thank you. Just as an experiment, I've stepped out of the barfly class. Well, a man must occupy himself with something. I'm glad to see you've taken up this enthusiasm for horseback riding, at least. Enthusiasm? Yeah. Patrolling that long, tedious, empty bridal pair? Empty? Well, it looked as crowded as usual to me this morning. It ought to be easy to find a girl who looks like that. Why don't you hire a private detective? It costs money, you know that. Yeah, perhaps she's popped over to the continent. Perhaps. I'd go over and do a bit of snooping around myself, but that costs money too. It's an awful bore to be hard up. Yes. Well, look here, my son. I came over this morning to try and cheer you up. I was awfully nice of you, Father. Yes, but, dash it all, you made me so infernally blue that I, uh... I think perhaps I'd better take a little walk. I promise not to come with you. Well, chin up, my boy. Excuse me, sir, can I... No, no, no. I'll see myself out, Bayless. Oh, thank you. Cheerio. Bye. Hope I'm not depressing you too, Bayless. Oh, no, sir. Cheer up, Mr. Jim. Did I ever tell you the story about Robert Bruce and the spider, sir? No, you never have, Bayless. But how you've tried. Well, sir, it seems that... When Bruce, that's Sir Robert Bruce, you know, sir... When he was fighting for his throne, he encountered numerous repulses. Phelous, I cannot stand a cheerful story. Oh, I understand, sir. Oh, well, it'll keep, sir. Something wrong, Bayless? Oh, I couldn't help... couldn't help observing your drawings. Oh, yeah. Do you know, sir... do you know, sir, that's quite as funny as those comic cartoons about improbable characters you see in the daily press, sir? It shouldn't be the least bit, sir. Bayless, say that again. They're funny, sir, as you call them in America. Bayliss, my beamish boy, we've been in a fog. Yes, sir. Why haven't we thought of that before? Yes, sir. We've done without money long enough. Yes, sir. Bayliss, comic cartoons. Yes, that's right, sir. A syndicated strip. Yes, sir. I even have a name for it. Hooray, sir. Same old dump. Isn't it lovely to be in London again, now that April's here? Yes, but this isn't April, darling. Oh, well, it's something. Per, shall we set the luggage, Mrs. Rich Switch? What did you call me? I mean, Madam. Herbert, tell them where to put the bags. Must I think of everything? Yes, my dear. Don't want to get you down, Pop. Oh! What's the meaning of that? I've noticed so many people laughing. So have I, ever since we docked this morning. Why, they stand about grinning like Cheshire cats when they're not actually guffawing. They must be very happy. What about? Oh, winning the war and everything. Never try to think, Eugenia. I'll take it. Hi, Esport. Hello, Isayla. Hello! How are you, sir? Hello, how are you? How are you, Miss Willis? I'm sorry I missed you at the boat train. And it's good to see you. It's been awfully dreary here without you. Dreary? We've just been talking about the extraordinary merriness of Mary England. Is it some sort of an epidemic? Well, I... Yes, it's been very disconcerting. I was afraid you might run into something like that. Afraid? Yes, that's why I wanted to meet you. You see, while you've been away, a chap called Piccadilly Jim has been rather busy. Piccadilly Jim? Piccadilly Jim! Now don't be upset, darling. I'm afraid you're not going to like this... much. This is preposterous! This is incredible! This simply cannot be! But it does look like you, Nesta. What? Hellbent! Yes, my dear. Look, let me have a big... Can't we do something about this? I've already spoken to my solicitor, and he seems to think if you bring suit in Chancery, you can stop this fellow. We'd better start it at once. And admit that I'm like that horrible monster? Never, never. Nesta, I'm sure the boy didn't mean it the way it looks. You defend him when it's all your fault. This is what I might have expected when you took up with that horrible ogling oaf. Ham. Yes, ham. Oh, don't, Nesta, don't. I can't bear it. Just like Eugenia to fail me in a crisis. All right, Eugenia, Uncle Herbert has feet. Want a hand with her feet, Pa? No. I'm terribly sorry, Anne. If I ever meet that Piccadilly Jim, I'll... Dun, da, dun. Brrr, brrr, brrr. Da, da, dee. Dun, brrr, brrr. Ba, da, dee, dee. Brrr, ba, da, dee, dee. Dun, ba, da. Whistle. Nice footwork, Maylis. Oh, I beg your pardon, sir. Good morning, Bailes. Good morning, sir. My son at home? He's hard at work, sir. Oh, fine, fine. Opulence is the fruit of toil, Bailes. Yes, sir. Any results from that army of detectives he's employing? None at all, sir. Oh. You're looking very well today, Mr. Crocker. Yes, and why shouldn't I, Bailes? Never has the genius of the Crocker's risen to such heights of achievement and acclaim. Yes, sir. Hello, Father. Hello. Well, James, my son in air. I'm going to be your air. leave me something to inherit. That is the fourth new suit of clothes this week. Oh yes, well you know James, my boy. In the spring a richer iris stains the bosom of the dove. Kind of a late spring, isn't it? Oh, yes. Well, I spoke metaphorically. Eugenia's arrived back in London. Oh, isn't that nice? Yes. Hey, Lewis. Yes, sir? Oh, yes, thanks. How is she? Oh, looking glorious, despite the month that has intervened. She's one of those fatal women, Jim, my boy, you know, that age cannot wither, nor custom stale her... No, sir. Nor custom stale her infinite variety, sir. Oh, thank you, Bayliss. Thank you, sir. Will that be all, sir? That will be all, Bayliss. In that case, I'll go and roll our socks, sir. Roll up my... When did she get back? Yesterday afternoon. Not too upset by the series, I hope. Oh, she, of all people, understands the pets and their true colors. Yes. I've been trying to see her ever since their arrival, but she's being held incommunicado. The pets are using ruthless methods. But you just said you'd seen her. I said she was looking glorious. Modern science, my boy, sometimes provides balm for the aching heart. Her picture was in the papers, arriving at Folkestone. Mr. and Mrs. Herbert, pet and party. Well, I can't keep her from you for long, Father. We'll get a writ of thingamabob, if necessary. Yes, I wish they printed these on better grade of paper. Father, that girl. Yes, that's Eugenia. No, no, that one, that one. Oh, probably her niece. Where are they staying? At the Hotel Milan. Oh, Bayless! My hat and coat, Bayless. Have I got my trousers? Yes. What is it? What's the excitement? Anne, that's the girl I've been combing London for. Bayless, my gloves. Saying she hasn't spoken of you to Eugenia. She didn't even know my name. My umbrella, Bayless. Probably she's been looking for you. Oh, not a chance. Oh, you're too modest, my boy. Wait till she finds out that you're Jim Crocker. Piccadilly Jim, the creator of From Rags to Riches. I never thought of that. That's her family. Oh, yes, so it is. We've got to do some awfully fast talking, Father. Come on. Yes, I will. But may I wish you good luck, sir? Oh, yes, Phelous. I'm sorry. Thank you very much. We'll need it, Phelous. Is that... Oh, yes, yes. After you. Thank you. Eugenia? Eugenia! Yes, darling. Wasn't your drunk close? Yes, yes, almost. What's that dress doing out? Velvet crushes so terribly. Pack it this instant. But I might want to go out. That's just what I thought. You're not going to see that shop-worn lothario while I... At Nesta? Oh, yes, darling. I'm ready. Pack it. Have you the list? Here it is. Now this includes everything we ordered when we were here last. Well, I hope they're ready. Now I don't suppose Eugenia forgot more than half her purchases? No, she... Why, Uncle Herbert? What's the matter? I've been followed. By whom? Five or six hundred people. Laughing. All of them laughing. Were you able to get the tickets? There was nothing good left. Oh, but didn't you take whatever they had? I'd go home in the boiler room. Four inside cabins. Second class. Aunt Nester, if you'll only wait until Friday... I wouldn't stay five unnecessary minutes in this land of laughing hyenas. Boat train leaves at 6.30. Well, that means leaving here by 6. You'll have to hurry, darling. Well, I'll get as many of these things as I can and have them sent away. Now, get back a little ahead of time. Don't forget Lord Priory wants to take us to the station. Bye, darling. Nester, the man at the Travel Bureau got laughing. They had to give him smelling salts. Oh! No, you don't. It may be for me. Hello? Am I... Of course I'm here. What? Oh, Mr. Crocker downstairs. Put him on. Let me talk to him. I'll talk to him. Hello? Is that you, Mr. Crocker? Oh, yes, Mrs. Pett. I wanted to talk... Hello! No, I'm not. I'm not. I don't want to argue. I... Esperance. But please, I just... My dear lady, we don't... I'm not interrupting, I just... Oh! You- They're leaving for America tonight. Oh, but they can't do that. Now see what you've done with your rags to riches. You don't suppose I did it purposely, do you? I could... That's Anne! What? Anne! You... I don't... Oh! I beg your pardon. I beg your... Oh! Pardon me. Sorry? Something I can do for you, monsieur. No, thank you. There are two dresses for my aunt and one for myself. Anne? I'll have to take them without final fittings. I'll look them up, madame. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm in a great hurry. We're leaving for America tonight. But you can't do that just when I found you. Really, Mr. White? Incidentally, my name is Nut White. I didn't think it was. I have been looking for you for weeks. Bridal Path every morning, Crystal Club every night. I, oh, excuse me, sorry. Isn't there someplace we could go where we could talk? You heard me say I was terribly rushed. But you could put off going to New York. Oh no, I can't. What do you mean? Ever hear of a cartoonist who calls himself Piccadilly Jim? I believe his real name's Crocker. Well, he's done a series of cartoons. And as a result, my family can't show their faces in public. Oh, that's awful. But you see, he didn't know. Didn't know what? Well, he didn't know that you were connected with... Well, what difference would that have made? Well, a lot, perhaps. You see, he's a friend of mine. Of... rather, he's an old enemy. I have kind of a hold over him. Will you do something for me, Mr... What is your name, anyway? My name? Bayless. Yes, Bayless. Well, Mr. Bayless, will you give Mr. Piccadilly Jim a message from me? Will you tell him he's a cad, a rotter, a bounder, and then start in on the American words? He won't like it. Tell him just the same. I'll do better than that. I'll get him to stop those pictures. Do you think you could? I don't, Madame. We'll send the flocks to your hotel within half an hour. Oh, thank you. And there was some lingerie. Oui, Madame, this way. Now, you won't leave for New York, will you? Because you've given me your word those cartoons would stop? Well, they will. Well, the harm's done anyway. This lady will take care of you, madame. You wish, madame? Some things would be marked with my initials. What undergarments, madame? Well, the... Will you stop following me around? Well, couldn't we go somewhere and have a dish of tea? Not a chance. I have to pick up this list of things and be back at my hotel by six. Seems a rather dreary way of spending our last afternoon together. This is not our afternoon, Mr. Bayless. I know the nicest place to go for tea. They have a little lake with swans on it. You have to fight the swans to see which gets the cakes. If there's one thing I need at the moment, it's a good fight with a swan. Well, as long as I'm going to stop those cartoons, I don't see how you can refuse me this one favor. And my list? I'll attend to that myself. I'll ship them to you tomorrow. If necessary, I'll swim over with them in my mouth. Where is this swan dive? Well, it's just a step. It's a little place called Tipling on the Thames. They call it that because it's not on the Thames and it's been sober for years. And I could really get back in time? Of course. What is the nature of the garments, madame? Oh, well, there was a... Haven't you any tact? Oh, oh, well, I'll go and get a very nice little taxi and I'll be waiting for you right outside. I beg your pardon. I'll be very happy to, sir. But it's lovely. And all the yammering I had to put up with. Someday you'll learn that father knows best. Yeah. How do you do? Maybe have some tea. Indeed you may, sir. There's hot scones and strawberry jam and homemade plum cake. And there's a table for you by the lake. Oh, how are the swans? A bit hungry, sir. Tony Tony. No, I'm calling those names. They won't like you. Don't let them get too close, they snap. Look out! Oh! Your day's quite ready, sir. Oh, thank you. This way. You'll find everything satisfactory. Thank you. I guess you weren't brought up in the country. I'm afraid I wasn't. New York City? Lots of cities. I was a sort of hotel child until my parents died. Then I went to boarding school. Oh, I see. Oh, thank you. Were you always beautiful or did you wear corrective eyeglasses and have stringy hair and wear bands on your teeth? Mm-hmm, bands. I used to cry at night thinking people hated to look at me. I wish I'd known you in those days. I would have seen beyond those golden bands. I doubt it. Admit you're beginning to like me, though. You're lots of fun. Is that what you're looking for? You know, my father was a little like you. We lived a crazy sort of existence here, there, and everywhere. My mother never knew the meaning of security. Security's very much overrated. You must have found that out since you've been living with your aunt and uncle. No, I like it. I think that's what I love about England. It's so safe and substantial and established. You are not by any chance thinking of Lord Priory. Perhaps. Are you in love with him? No, I like him very much. He's kind, he's charming, and he's genuine. Phew, that's a relief. Why? Well, if you care to hang about him, you couldn't talk like that. Now, what would you say about me, for instance? Well, I'd say you were charming and utterly worthless. Oh, that's fine. I'd much rather have you say that than what you said about him. It sounds a little bit less like a dish of cold mashed potatoes. I'm glad you're satisfied. Satisfied nothing, but it gives me a head start. If what you want is stability and moral grandeur, you'll have to give me at least a week. What time is it, by the way? Uh... It's, um... it's 4.30. Well, we've got to get underway. Oh, well, you... now... Now you promised. We really shouldn't rush away like this. Oh yes, we should. Was everything all right, sir? Oh yes, fine, thank you very much. Oh, I'm so glad. But you will sign the guest book, won't you, sir? Well, I've signed it. I signed it about a year ago. Oh, the young lady will sign it for me, won't you miss? Yes, of course I will. Well, you come right in the house now. But we really must hurry. Yes, I'll hurry. I'll go and tell the driver. If we get back by six o'clock, the young lady sails right out of my life. Have you no heart, man? You're asking me to stike me professional reputation, sir. I know, but there might be a longer way. Well, there is one through the woods, but it's a bit rough, sir. That could be the shortcut. Oh, yes, it could, sir. Now, how about a blowout? What, and me have to change a tire? No, sir. I've got a bit of engine trouble. Oh, that would be fine. That would be just fine. And you said two quid, sir, in addition to the regular fare. Your watch must be wrong. The clock inside says five. It's stopped. We have to make awfully good time. I guess we better take the shortcut. Right-o, sir. The shortcut it'll be, sir. life. things happen sir possibly motor trouble either motor trouble or we hit a volcano you might have told us if this road was in need of repair what gives out she's blown our blooming goss kit what's that you mean to tell me you've never heard of a gasket whatever have you been miss well what are we going to do call another taxi Taxi! We've been followed. Oh, don't be irritating. Where can we get something? A telephone? There's a box half a mile down the road, miss. Well, come on. What? But Anne, darling, you'll never make it in time. It's six o'clock now. Scruptor. How'd you ever get to a place called Scrumpton? Well, you see, Aunt Nesta, after I'd gotten that list of things, I had an hour or two to spare. That's why I came out here to have a dish of a... I mean, a cup of tea. Oh. Well, I, uh... Kelly, you met an old school friend. I met a girl I went to school with. Mm-hmm. Someone you loved very much. Someone... Oh, but Aunt Nesta, well, there's no reason for you to miss your boat. I'm all right. Well, I'm not being made uncomfortable in England as you are. Yes, but Anne, darling, I'm so confused. Yes, but I must consider it. What? Oh, well, all right. She wants us to go without her. But that's impossible. I thought you'd say that. May I make a suggestion? No. I'm leaving for America very shortly anyway. If you let me take care of Anne, I can perfectly well go on the next boat. Oh dear Lord Friarie, wouldn't that be a dreadful imposition? No, it'd be a very great pleasure, I assure you. Oh Lord Friarie, Mary! Oh my! Mary, you'll remain here and come on the next boat with Miss Anne. Yes, how do you do, dear? We're starving. Yes, dear. But why couldn't I stay in Chaperone, Anne? Who's Chaperone you? Get along. Go on, go on, go on. Oh, Jack! Herbert! Yes, my dear. She's going. Emma, look after the luggies. I'll go and help your father. Eugenia, stop looking around. Wait in the compartment. I'll be fine. You've been so kind to me. Look, darling, I won't take you now. You have seat in this compartment, no? Yes. I introduce myself, no? No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I am Count Osric of Denmark. Beautiful lady is traveling to America, no? Yes, no. Please. Don't faint, Eugenia. Mr. Crocker. Sailing on the same boat with you to America, if you have no objections. No, no. You're not afraid. Oh, no. Of course not. Do be careful, though. They're coming. Oh, uh, yeah. Ah! We have this compartment to ourselves. This gentleman has a place, Count... Osric. Count Osric of Denmark. Oh, a count, did you say? Yes. My sister, Mrs. Herbert Peth. Oh, oh, charm. Ah, how do you do, Count? This is my husband, Mr. Peth. And my little boy, Odin. Ah, my little man. Another child, huh? Nice going, ma. Odin. Yeah, he has the American sense of humor. Yeah. Ogden, Ogden! My dear fellow, you don't realize what you're asking me to do. I'm giving you a chance to tear up my contract. As there ought to be no more rags to riches, I think that's only fair. It's proved to be a very popular feature. I've just arranged to have it syndicated in the United States. That's too bad, but it's got to stop. But it's not your property, my dear chap. What? In rags to riches, you started a feature. which would be continued even if you ceased to exist. Do you mean to tell me that you would get someone to draw this even if I couldn't? We have no choice. Good night. Do you still wish to be released from your contract? Well, I started this bobsled downhill. I suppose I might as well try and steer it. That's all right, Mary. I'll answer it. Put those in the trunk, please. Yes, ma'am. Hello? Oh, Mr. Bayless. Well, I just wanted to tell you that I saw Piccadilly Jim the first thing this morning, and I'm afraid it's going to be a little bit difficult. Yes. You see, he has an iron-bound contract. And I hope he won't be too disappointed. No, not at all. You're not exactly the type of man one puts much faith in, Mr. Bayless. No, I can't have lunch with you. But I don't want any explanations. It may simplify matters to let you know that I have an engagement for every waking moment. No, no, not tomorrow. Tomorrow I'm sailing on the Mona mania. What? Priory sailing too? Oh, now, wait a minute. I... Hello. Oh. Bayless? Yes, sir? We are sailing tomorrow morning on the monomania for America, Bayless. America, sir? Yes. Well, sir, like father, like son, if you'll excuse my saying so. You're not quite so hasty as Mr. Crocker was. He did scamper often, then. He wouldn't even know where he'd gone if he hadn't left the note saying he'd taken your six best ties, sir. And while we're on the subject, Bayless, I'm going to change my name. America. Oh, really, sir? Yes. I'm going to change it to Bayless. You're to be my father. Yes, but, sir, I... Well, I've always done my best to give satisfaction, sir. You'll make the reservations in your name. I'll telephone at once, sir. One single first-class cabin and one servants' accommodation. No, one double first-class cabin, Bayliss. Be ashamed to break up such a happy family. Yes, sir. America. Judy, I've never been there, sir. Do you think America will understand me? I think you should both make an effort, Bayliss. Very good, sir. But I How do you do? How do you do, miss? And Lord Priory? How do you do, sir? Milord. You didn't tell me you were sailing on this boat. When I talked to you, I hadn't decided yet. Had I, Father? Why, yes. No, no, I think not, my son. It was Mr. Bayless who made me miss my other boat. Indeed. Yes, I said I was sorry. I didn't mean it, but I have the decency to say so. Won't you forgive me? It didn't work any particular hardship. Oh, well. I guess we better be running along. Father? Yes, my son. I'm delighted to have met you, Mr. Bayless. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye, my lord. me father. Quite so, my son. and I'm through. You know, I'm lucky to find a brother like Bailey's here. Ready? I did that deliberately. I need a rest. Is your father still sick? My father? Oh, uh, father. Yes, he isn't a very good sailor. Then shouldn't you spend more time with him? I might just as well. Can't you ever get rid of him? I was left in his charge and he's very conscientious. I should say so. Besides, I don't want to. I don't believe you. Ready? Boy, aren't you getting a bit strong? Sorry, you want me to get it? It's fine, I'll get it. This isn't funny. I've got a plan. I'm getting him worked up to the proper pitch. Next time I'll skim it over to the side and he'll go after it without thinking. Why play if it bores you? It gives me these brief delirious moments. Ready! What's the idea? Human Backstar Bowboy! You ought to eliminate the breaks of the game somehow! Laughter Ready? Ready! That's too bad. Should we send for another one? No, thank you. I think I've had enough. Well, what's next on the program? How about a good swift sprint around the deck? No, thank you. I think we'll just sit around for a while. All right, you are. Little later then, what? Come along, Anne. See you in a little while ago, Mr. Bayless. Yes. We had a good time, aren't we? Is your customs declaration made out all right? Mm-hmm. I'm ready to walk off the boat as soon as it darks in the morning. You know, now that it's so close at hand, I'm a little terrified at the thought of New York. Why? Oh, I don't know. I... Perhaps I could explain better out on deck. Shall we go? Out with it now. Why this fear of my country? Well, it isn't your country exactly. It's your opinion of me that I'm really worried about. What if I don't stack up very well against all those skyscrapers and things? But that's just borrowing trouble. Still, one can't help feeling pretty fearful about something that's terribly important to a chap. Oh, now you're laughing at me. No, I'm not, Freddie, really. It's just odd to have a man make love to you without telling you what a wonderful fellow he is. And what a tremendous break he's giving you in letting you know that he cares. Why couldn't it possibly feel like that? Of course, I haven't very much to offer. I don't agree with you. I didn't hear the first part of this conversation, but right off the cuff, I'd say you had a lot to offer. Well, thanks very much. Good evening, Mr. Bayless. Good evening. I could wangle what I'm about to suggest in a lot of tricky ways, Lord Priory. But I think it better to ask it as a favor in the name of fair play, perhaps. Oh, what is it? Give me five minutes alone. with an unappreciated five minutes this is not very much you've rather taken advantage of your position chaperone here you can forget it for that long so i go and don't ask and is just between you and me five minutes make the most of them that is dot i've tried to dislike that fellow ever since i met him and i can't do it he's Well, we haven't very much time to lose. Let's get things just as they were. Now let me see, how were you when I so rudely interrupted? Oh yes, you were about like that, that's right. And I, or rather, Priory... Yes, Priory was about like this, that's right, isn't it? Right, so far. Where do we go from here, Mr. Bayless? You couldn't possibly say, where do we go from here? Jim, could you? Where do we go from here? Jim. That's better. Now let's consider the whole question of Priory and me. Cast up a count, as it were. He has a title and I have none. Pleasant, but not awfully important. He is reliable, and you think I'm not. Haven't you given me some cause? Forget it. There's electricity when you and I are together. That's not true of you and Priory. Well, maybe he's not very exciting, but I know where he stands always. He's awfully right. And my family like him. Ah, you're being forced into this. Not in the least. Are you sure? You should be very grateful to your family. Remember, they've taken care of you. My aunt and uncle wouldn't force me into anything. They're really very sweet. Yes, yes, I know they are. You know they are? Well, that they... they must be. They're your aunt and uncle. I want you to meet them. They'll be at the pier in the morning. They will be at the... Oh. And my luggage will be right next to yours on the dock. Why? Why, Bayless, Chester, B, C. Oh, yes, of course that's right, isn't it? You... You will understand if I am not on the dock in the morning. Understand what? Well, it isn't because I don't want to meet your aunt and uncle, it's just that I... I get... Land sick. Land sick? Yes, yes. The sudden stopping of the motion of the boat makes me frightfully ill. It's hours sometimes before I get over it. You don't want to meet my family. Oh, don't be so... Certainly I... Priory? Oh, Priory? You know, if he's going to America, he must learn to be prompt. After all, time is money and money... What is money? Oh, we couldn't settle all that this evening, could we? Priory? Priory! I want you to meet our very dear friend, Count Arthur. So good. and find the home. They have brought the war to your aunt's country. Oh, that's outrageous! Terrific. Yes, and Herbert has threatened to shave off his eyebrows so he can get to the office without causing a riot. Bayless! Yes, Bayless, what are you... Oh, Bayless, of course, you remember me, Count Osric. What? Yes, sir. You know Mr. Bailers? Oh, I know Bailers for a long time. He worked for some friends of mine. Haven't I seen you before? Aren't you the butler of that young scoundrel who called himself Piccadilly Jim? Well, no, not exactly, madam. No, you see, I left his service, madam, to travel with my son. Yeah, I heard. Well, the son of a butler. What did you say? Oh, nothing. Isn't your son getting off the boat, Mr. Bailers? It's a rather peculiar thing. He's land sick. The sight of you has brought back a most unpleasant memory. That, madam, leaves me in a state of indifference, bordering upon the supernatural. Yeah, me too. I didn't quite understand it all, but I think you're being impertinent, by the way. Oh, no, Belis, he's never impertinent. Let us enter your luggage. Of course you have the courtesy of the poor. Goodbye, Mr. Belis. Will you ask your son to phone me? We're in the book. Yes, miss, thank you. Come, Eugenia. Aren't you coming, cunt? to be this for just a minute if you know if well that was a close call bailers mr. Crocker where's my son lying doggo sir cabin 281 doggo to anything well I'll go Come in! Yeah. Uh, they tell me that you are very crunk, huh? Who are you? I'm from the Port Authority. You, uh, you perhaps have sprinkles on your chest, eh? Go away. Uh, I feel your pulse, eh? Get out of here. Feverish? That's none of your business. Yeah, yeah, feverish. That's very bad. Where did you get that tie? Well, I didn't think you'd mind, son. I only took six. Father. No, no, no. Count Osric of Denmark to the world. My most successful role. Well, it's great stuff. How was the romance? Well, I am now the house guest of Mr. Mrs. Herbert Pitt. A title, my boy, is a golden key to the affection. And how was Eugenia? We were on the point of chancing a marriage when your rags to riches began appearing in the American newspapers. Already? They were sensational, but in the pet household, there's a catastrophe. Eugenia is again torn between love and family loyalty. I'm terribly sorry. Well, sorry isn't enough. This persecution must cease. I'll do something, Father, but you've got to give me time. Time? You're asking for time when I'm spending the best days of my life in a nest of crepe hair? I can't understand it, sir. Are you sure you gave me the right number? Positive. It's Butterfield, 89597. Try it again, it can't be busy all this time. Oh, very good, sir. B-U-T-T-E-R. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the matter, sir? Just B-U and then the number. Oh, I see. Thank you, sir. Very possibly that's why I got the wrong connection, sir. More than likely. B... Bayless, I think you ought to know that I'm going to tell her who I am. Over the phone, sir? Preferably not over the phone, Bayless. Over a cold bird in a bottle. Oh, yes, sir. Hello, are you there? Oh, you are there. Well, may Mr. Bayless speak to Miss Anchester, please? You know, it gives me quite an odd feeling to say that, sir. Yes, yes. Well, there's no percentage in this deceit business. Yeah, hold the line, please. Hello. Hello, Anne. Hello, Jim Bayless. Oh, is that the young man? Well, why don't you drop into tea this afternoon? But I want you to meet my family. Oh, oh, I see. Mm-hmm. He's making excuses. He doesn't dare tell me it's because his father's a butler. Oh, Sugar. Oh, this evening. I'm sorry, but I have an engagement. You... Yes, Priory is right. You aren't going to see him. What did you say? Well, I say, couldn't you say it was a school friend who'd come to town? You know, that same old school friend. Say that you have to have dinner with her. Yes, and that you're going to meet her at the... El Choclo Club. You will? Yes, say that you have to meet her there at 8.15. That's right. Goodbye. Your dinner clothes, sir. Now, you better lay out my white organdy with the blue sash, Bayless. I've turned out to be a sweet girl graduate. It seems to me I've heard that tango before. You bet you have. I'm no fool. Shall we dance? There's a little matter I'd like to clear up with you first. That's why I asked to meet you here instead of at your house. Well? Here goes. It's like this. Maybe you'll be relieved to hear that I know already. You do? Have you been away from America so long that you think it's a disgrace? Disgrace? Listen, Jim, if I were in love with you, which I'm not, I wouldn't care if your father dug ditches or picked rags. That's what my uncle does in a big way. What on earth are you talking about? Snobbishness. It's not one of my vices. Would you mind making sense for a change? I happen to learn quite by accident that your father's a butler. Didn't he tell you? My father's a Mike, but no, no. Well, it doesn't make a particle of difference to me. So don't stammer and hesitate before you speak of it. Well, that isn't what I was going to tell you. Well, if it isn't Piccadilly Jim. How you do, Barbara? Hello, Paducah. Pinky McGregor, Mr. Crocker. How do you do? I, uh, Miss Chester, may I present Miss Pomeroy and Mr. McGregor? How do you do? I have to eat my words about your art, Duck. This rags to riches series is sublime. I can't drink my coffee till I've seen them. Don't you adore them, Miss Chester? They're terribly amusing. Give me a buzz, will you? I'm a contropolis. Goodbye. Goodbye, Miss Chester. Goodbye. I suppose one way of finding out is just as good as another. Quite. Will you do me one favor? Yes, of course. Let me leave quietly and alone. They'll get me a taxi at the door. But Anne, I didn't know it was your family. That doesn't make any difference. You did an ugly, harmful thing to people who were hurt by it. Then you didn't even have the courage to admit what you'd done. But I tried to stop the feature and I couldn't. I've done my donders. I'm really not interested. It's an old-fashioned phrase, but it's a relief to say it. I despise you from the bottom of my heart. Anne. Goodbye. Bayless, give me some more ink. Right here, sir. That's a very handsome house, sir. Mm-hmm. That's the orphanage after Mrs. Richswitch has remodeled it. And there she is presenting it to the kids. Hmm. Haven't you made her just a trifle too kindly, sir? Well, our public eats it up, Bayless. I myself prefer the earlier interpretation of the lady, sir. Well, I had to soften them up for father's sake, if for nothing else. I hope it's done him some good, at least. Speaking as one father of another, sir, I wish Mr. Crocker kept us in touch with his progress. Father is living his part, Bayless. He is Count Osric. He doesn't even know we exist. Oh, excuse me, sir. package for Miss Anchester from Riverside Drive. They refuse delivery at that address. Yes, I know. Yeah? Well, why do you always keep sending them? None of your lip. Here's your paper, sour puss. Thank you, droop snoot. What bouts this time, Bayless? Five pounds of candy, sir. Shall I put it in the morgue? It's getting to be quite a collection, sir. Yeah, isn't it? I hope. When your lovebirds fail to move her, sir, I must confess I almost gave up hope. I'm afraid I have, Bayless. Oh, but I... But sir, we... We mustn't give up, sir. It is related, sir, that when Robert Bruce, that is, Sir Robert Bruce, was fighting for his kingdom... Bayless. Get me the newspaper. I beg your pardon. I suppose I ought to tell you, sir, it's come. It's come? What's come? Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Pett announced the engagement of their niece, Miss Anne Chester. Priory? May I see? Early wedding is planned. Mrs. Pett has achieved great prominence as the original of that beloved newspaper character, Mrs. Richswitch. I never thought Miss Anne would go through with it, sir. If I may venture, sir... He doesn't love Mr. Priory. Lord Frederick Priory. Yes, but I don't think he is Lord Frederick Priory, sir. To the best of my belief, the last of the surviving Priories was killed in a balloon on the mounds, sir. Ballooned? Bayless, why didn't you say so before? I wanted to make absolutely certain, sir. I'd written to the College of Arms to inquire. Written? Why didn't you cable? I didn't think the college would apply to a cable, sir. But if you wanted to send one to Mr. Reggie Slade personally, I'm sure he'd know. Get one off to him right away. Yes, sir. Will you write it out, sir? I haven't time. I've got to warn her. Yes, sir. I've got to say this is a crazy mistake, Anchester. He's an imposter. Yes, sir. You're falling for a phony coroner. Yes, sir. You're a poor, deluded title hunter, and I love you. And I love you, sir. Thank you, Bayless. No, sir. I mean, that's what she'll say. You've given me ammunition. Your coat, sir. I can stall the citadel. Your hat, sir. Break down the bastion. Charge I want to speak to Miss Anchester. Miss Chester isn't at home, sir. Then let me speak to Mrs. Pett. Oh, you are a reporter, sir. Reporter? Certainly not. I'm James Crocker, Jr. I'm sorry, sir. Miss Pett is entertaining the press. The press? Yes, sir. If you would care to wait, sir. I'll wait. And the name is Crocker? Yes, and so if there won't be any mistake about it, you might say Piccadilly Jim. Piccadilly Jim? Oh, yes, sir. Already now, are you sure that you have Mrs. Switchridge in focus? Oh, yes. Yes, well, that's fine. How are you all ready? If you look at a little birdie, please. One, two, three, schnapps! Thank you very much. Really, thank you. Thank you very much. Pardon me, Mrs. Pett. Didn't I tell you that I don't wish to be interrupted? Yes, Madame, but there is a gentleman... I am devoting this hour to the press. Now, my dear, is there anything more I can tell you? Just one thing more, Mrs. Richwitch. Or should I say Mrs. Pett? No, no, no. Say Mrs. Richwitch. After all, Mrs. Pett is just Mrs. Pett. But Mrs. Richwitch, she is the goddess of the new mythology. I do believe she is the best-known figure in the United States. Of course, there's this woman that says she's the sweetheart of Popeye. But compared to... Mrs. Richwich, she is like a bottle of mineral water compared to a quarter of fine old liquor scotch. That reminds me. Oh, thank you, Herbert, thank you. Well, are there any more questions, ladies and gentlemen? They have to appear at the radio station this afternoon. The radio? You didn't tell us about the radio. Oh, Mrs. Richwich, if you want her to tell you something about herself, you never know anything. She's like a little mouse. A wee, shrinking little mouse. the wireless that's going on my side. Yeah, well, what about the radio? Well, the account has arranged for us to be featured on the Peter Norris Hour. My dear husband, myself, and... And the dear darling Ogden. We are being paid one of the largest sums ever paid in radio. How interesting, but surely, Mr. Pet, to a man of your means, money could hardly be... Ah, but the dear account has taken care of that. Yeah. We are turning the money over to him, and then he, in turn, will dispose of it the amongst the what was it count the impoverished nobility of my country I think that's just too sweet oh yeah well mr. Rich which we won't keep you any longer we know you're a woman of affairs and I beg your pardon oh yes good afternoon and thank you very good afternoon oh you certainly have good afternoon good afternoon goodbye what was it you wanted when you interrupted me so rudely I wish to inform you, madam, that Mr. James Crocker Jr. is waiting to see you. Piccadilly Jim. Piccadilly Jim? Well, why didn't you tell me? Herbert, did you hear that? The one man in the world I owe everything to, and he leaves me here with a lot of babbling idiots. Don't stand there. Tell Mr. Crocker that I'll see him at once. Yes, ma'am. The madam will be with you in a minute. Would you care to wait in there? Oh, thank you. Ogden? Oh hi, Esport. I'm surprised at you. What, am I going to chew on it? No, no, no. You misunderstand me. That, however, is no way to hold a piece of charcoal. You get no freedom of movement that way. You must hold it like this. Okay, if you're a fool for form. Ogden? Ogden, how can you speak in such a way to Mr. Crocker? How do you do, Mr. Crocker? Mrs. P- I- I'm so glad to see you, Mr. Crocker. Ogden, darling. Yes, ma'am. Go wash your face and hands, and then retire to your room. But, ma, we go in here in a half an hour. So we do. Well, wash your face and hands just the same, and practice your radio voice, Ogden. Yes, ma'am. Call for Peter Norris! This time we've broadcasted Mr. Crocker. They're calling it the Ritz-Switch Hour. Oh, Mr. Crocker, how you've transformed my simple life. I don't believe even the movie stars are more pursued in a way. You know, I'm afraid I was a little bit stupid at first about your cartoon series. But I always want to know that they turn out so very entrancingly. You know, it was a foreign guest of ours, Conk Ulsterich of Denmark, who first pointed out their very real charms. May I quote you his phrase? in the new mythology. Yes, he was. Well, that's a little bit exaggerated, but I do believe that I've become one of the best-known figures in the United States. Ah, yes. You know, there's a woman who claims to be that sweet art of Popeyes, but I don't believe it. No, no, neither do I. You know, it's astonishing, Mrs. Pat. Anne tells me that... Anne? Have you met Anne? Yes. Well, how strange. She never told me. Wondrous. You know, I didn't realize you were in this country, or I'd have given a large party. Oh, no, no. I wouldn't want you to do that. Oh, here comes Herbert to tell you about the wonderful effect on his business. Herbert? Never had such publicity to crock our sails have been doubled. You've done a lot for the pet process. You know, it's glorious blossom, the reconstructed fabric... Herbert, couldn't we forget that phase of subject? Yes, my dear, yes. But my dear, look... Oh, we must leave for the broadcasting. But my sister Eugenia will entertain you, if I can find her. Eugenia? Yes, Mr. She's my library. Come here, darling. I hope you won't hold it against her, that she seems rather to have forgotten about your dear father. But a fascinating foreigner with a title, you know. That Count Osric, of whom I spoke, it's he who arranged our radio engagement. Oh, he did? Did you call, dear? Darling, you remember Eugenia? Oh, yes, indeed. Where's the Count? I think he's in the conservatory. I'll call him. Hola. Oh, yes. See, yeah, yeah. Your son, I mean, Mr. James Crocker Jr. is in the other room. Oh, yes. Oh, gee! Oh, gee! You are... Say, what's the big idea? Hey, Ma! We got... So we must. Oh, come. You haven't met Mr. Crocker. This is Picardy Lane Gym. Ah, ah. Oh. Slips. So sorry to rush off this way. Couldn't you take part luck with us tonight? Just the family, Lord Priority and the Count. I'd love to. Eugenia, don't forget to turn on the radio for our broadcast. I'll do it now. Au revoir, dear boy. Count. Help me to save. I'll do it. You did a wonderful job on that lady, Father. Oh, patientosh, my boy. It's all your doing. After all, it's only nature following art. Where Mrs. Richwich leaves, nests a pet father. Ah, but you helped. Ah, I wish I could have done as much with Anne. Tell me about her. I'm afraid it's hopeless, my boy. Where is she now? Out with Priory? Yes, but she'll be back soon. Shouldn't we discuss our more vital problems? My boy, we need your advice. Oh, well, what about? Nesta has become so, is sweet the word? Yes, almost saccharine, really. Shouldn't we fling deception to the winds and throw ourselves on her mercy? Oh, would that be wise? Oh, I would go a little bit easy, my children. I have a feeling that the old Nesta is just smoldering. Oh dear. Yes, but this Nesta is becoming an awful nooses. At Nesta! What? Yes, darling. We're in here. How are you? My sweet, there's someone here that... Oh, yes, hello. May I see Anne alone, please? Of course. I don't want to see him alone. Oh, darling, hear what he has to say, please. All right. Come on, love. As I remember, it's awful to be young. Good luck, my boy. Come, come, come. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, what are you doing here? Well, I came here to give you some information. I think it's straight. I've cabled London and I'll know by tonight. I'm not interested, thanks. Oh, now look here. Your whole family's forgiven me. Because you've crawled. Well, I haven't. Good. I knew that cartoon series was just an excuse on your part. For what? For not admitting you were in love with me, even to yourself. I'm in love with Lord Priory and I'm going to marry him. I have very good reason to believe that he is not Lord Priory. Would you mind leaving this house at once? Not until I've told you a few home truths about yourself. Sit down. I'm sorry, take this, it's got a better bottle. I'll do no such thing. You are making the most stupid mistake in the world. You're trying to use your brain to choose a husband instead of your instinct. It can't be done, it's all wrong. Marriage isn't an engineering problem like, like Boulder Dan. I'm in love with him. Oh no, you're not. You may have been more or less when you boarded that boat to come to America. You notice I say more or less because if you'd really been in love with him, you couldn't have gotten over it so quickly. I didn't get over it. Yes you did. That last night on board, you were half out of love with him The other night at the El Choclo Club, you were very much in love with me, in spite of the fact that it upset your plans, almost as much as I'm in love with you. Ten minutes more and I'd have told you who I was, and you would have called me a liar and a cheat and possibly a cad, but you'd have said it between a smile and a sob and you'd have forgiven me. For some reason, best known to the fates, that last ten minutes was not to be. You learned the truth in the worst possible way, swept out of the El Choclo Club into the arms of a waiting briary who was too stupid to recognize a rebound when he saw one. Have a cigarette. No, thanks. Where are you going? To my room. It won't do you any good. Your Aunt Nester invited me for dinner. Aunt Nester can make a fool of herself if she likes, but I won't. Don't touch me. Get out of this house at once. Oh, but Ann, I... No! Yeah, yeah, yeah! It's on air. Did I read you that yet, Ma? Well, now put it away, and let's forget about the radio. We have more important things to talk about, haven't we, Lord Pryor? It's very kind of you to put it that way. Lord Pryor asked Herbert and me before dinner if we'd mind too dreadfully not having the enormous wedding that we'd planned. He and Anne feel that it would be so much sweeter if they could be married without any delay. Just the family and a few close friends present right here in our own home. Well, you mean tonight? Heavens no, but within a few days. Wouldn't this be the proper moment for you to read that cablegram you were expecting this afternoon? It hasn't arrived yet. How typical of you. Oh, you think so? Mrs. Pett, there is nothing more repulsive to me than an after-dinner speech. But might I say something? by way of a toast. Oh, how perfectly charming. Has everyone plenty of champagne? I think Olaf would like a little more. Gustav, champagne for the comb. Ah, yeah, good. The bottle of sunshine of France. Ha ha ha, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh. Oh. Well, old boy, what's your toast? Well, what I have to say comes under the heading of masquerades. We all masquerade, more or less, during the course of our lives. Recently, I masqueraded as Baelis, the son of my valet, when the name of Crocker was anathema to Miss Anne. That wasn't important. But if someone takes advantage of a masquerade, if a masquerade goes too far, I am inclined to go to the mat with a masquerader. I'm afraid I don't get your point. You will, my lord, you will. I think the time has come to lay our cards on the table, to come out in the open, to unmask. You're right, my boy. The time has come. You've given me courage. I don't. But father, I didn't mean you. What does this mean, Count? He's not Count Osric Nestor. No, but James Crocker, this boy's father. And the man I love. Be still, you imbecile. As for you, you conniving old viper! Get out! Ow! I said get out! And take your sheep's clothing with you! Violence, eh? Ah, this is not my Mrs. Richwich. You can leave too. You would not want me to again portray that earlier and meaner Mrs. Richwich. Don't you try to blackmail me! I can only draw people as I see them. Oh! I'm in a position now to give father that dowry. This is not a bad marriage, you know. I've been made a fool of in my own house. But Nester, darling, privacy is preferable. What? We can settle this without you, Herbert. Oh, yes, my dear, yes. Ah? Well, I'll tell you one thing. I may permit a simple ceremony here in the dining room. In the dining room. Well, that's better than. Well, Mr. Piccadilly, Jim, it didn't quite come off, did it? Well... Begging your pardon, madam, there is a man named Bailey's asking for Mr. Crockle. If you'll excuse me, I'll see him. And now we shall see what we shall see. And what is all this about? Bailey's didn't come. Here it is, sir. You opened it. I couldn't wait, sir. Well, well, but... The chap you refer to as calling himself Lord Priory is in reality Lord Priory, son of the fifth Marquis. Stop. He can be reached through Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Pett of New York City. Stop. What's it to you, old bean? Reggie. Nice work, Bayless. Must have been Lord Briary who was killed on the mounds, sir. Briary with a B, not Priory with a P. I feel a perfect ninny, sir. I don't know how to apologize. It's all right, Bayless. I'm the one that's the ninny. Going off like that half cocked. When does the next boat leave for England? Well, let me see, sir. There's the, er, the... Cronia sails at midnight, sir. Then tomorrow noon, as the Empress of Egypt... Skip it, we'll take the coronia. Tonight, sir? Yes, you buy the tickets and pack my things, as many of them as you can. I'm most terribly sorry, sir. That's all right, Beelus. Well, of course, Andy, after my honeymoon, I should want to go to someplace romantic, but comfortable, like hot springs. Freddy's off to the Gobi Desert. Well, you see, I hope you won't think I'm rude, but I must leave. Oh, yes, I've just received a cable gram from London and I'm sailing on the Koroni at midnight tonight. Tonight. Goodbye, my boy. I hope there's nothing serious. Oh, father. Goodbye, darling. Bless you, my children. Good trip, my boy. Thank you, sir. Goodbye, Ogden. Give my regards to the Tower of London and tell them they can keep it. And I... I'll see you at the door. If you'll excuse me, please. Of course. Well, isn't it too bad? I don't know about you. Lucky thing I'm not going. I'm going to see him. I was all wrong about Priory. Here's the cable gram if you're interested. I'm not. There's a lot of applesauce about my having to go back to London. I want to go. Why? I'd rather not be in the city with you and Priory with things as they are. But that's foolish. So many emotions are. As I won't be here to kiss the bride. I'll collect in advance if it's all the same to you. Do you mind? With all due respect to your country, sir, I shall be most frightfully glad to get back to England. I am glad that someone is glad to find something to be glad about. Well, you mustn't let yourself be discouraged, sir. The episode of Bruce and the Spider Bear's testament is that. Does it? Oh, yes, indeed, sir. You see, Robert Bruce, that Sir Robert Bruce, was fighting for the English throne. Six times he called his men to arms and flung them against the enemy, sir. And six times they were repulsed. The last encounter was so disastrous that his army was crushed, sir. His army was what? Crushed, sir. Crushed? Yes, sir. And he had to take refuge in a cold, damp cave. But it gets more cheerful, you know, sir. You see, as he was lying there, he suddenly looked up, and there on the rock above him, he saw a little spider, sir. Oh, a very might of a thing, sir. Yes, and he watched the poor little fella as he attempted to swing on a strand of web from the point where he was situated to a point a little further down, sir. And do you know what happened, sir? Do I have to guess, Bela? Oh, no, sir, not at all. No, I'm going to tell you, sir. He... he missed, sir. Oh yes, indeed he missed, but that didn't daunt him, not at all, sir. He ran right up the little strand of web he'd made, and prepared himself for... for a second attempt, sir. He missed for the fifth time! And now, sir, we come to the seventh try. Bayless, will you stop? Oh, but it's almost finished, sir. All right, go on and on and on. Well, sir, that little spider took a deep breath, as you might say, and flung himself off the ledge and by George, sir. Do you know what happened? He missed. Ah, that's when I have you, sir. I knew I'd have you. He didn't miss, sir. He made it. Is that the end of the story, Bayless? Almost, sir, all but the moral. Moral? The lesson that one Robert Bruce has thrown, sir, when he learned, no matter how bad things appear to be, sir, never give up. I see no po... Bayless? My Beamish boy, I believe you're right. I know I am, sir. Where are you going, sir? Where do you think I'm going? I'm fighting for something a lot more important than the throne of Scotland. I'm going to jump again, and this time I'm not going to miss. Sir Robert, I mean, Mr Jim... We made it over, Bond! Hail, Pope! You made it, sir! Yeah. J.
