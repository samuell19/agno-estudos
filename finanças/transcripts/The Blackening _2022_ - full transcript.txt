(CRICKETS CHIRPING) (SOUL MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) I love a good fire. Mmm. Let's get this place set. Ooh, this can go right here. Well, y'all gonna have to go, just for the weekend, though. Cheers to us. -(DOOR CREAKING) -(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Hello? Hello? Hello? Shawn? Yo, stop playing. (IN DEEP VOICE) I got a gun! (SOFTLY) God damn it. (DEEP VOICE) Hey, yo... That's too DMX. What are you doing? (IN NORMAL VOICE) Baby, is that you? (SCREAMS) -Damn, Morgan! -Nigga! See, I knew I shouldn't have got you the Muay Thai class for Christmas. You "strong" strong. You strong with a C. But why the hell didn't you say something? Damn, you almost made me spill my wine. So, you almost break your man nose, but, "Oh, no, my wine?" Baby, we are all alone in a cabin in the woods. Until the others get here, you got to announce yourself. -You asking for too much. -Am I? I'll touch your penis later. -Deal. -(SCOFFS) So predictable. Okay, okay, but you gotta check out this room. -This shit is wild. -How wild? -Come on. -Oh, you like it sick. Okay. SHAWN: Follow me. Follow the leader, huh? -MORGAN: Yeah. -(SHAWN CHUCKLES) (MIMICKING FOOTSTEPS) Stop playing. Is it Blade's house? Where's Wesley? I want to talk to Wesley. If it is, you know what they pay you for. Wait, hold up. I know I left this door open. -Uh-uh. I'mma go get my sage. -Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Come on, come on, come on, now. We good. Listen, I won't play. I watched a whole entire Dateline episode with this psycho brother and sister who kept their incest-bred kids hidden under the stairs of their Airbnb. Also, that wasn't Dateline, that was just the plot from the movie People Under the Stairs. You might be right. (GRUNTS) Oh. (SUCKS TEETH) Kinda fucked myself up, but here you go. -You okay? -Enter my port of doom. -Wow. -Come on, come, come. Did you know this house was gonna have this cool ass game room? No, I did not. But that's not why I brought you in here. You gotta check this out. -The Blackening. Seriously? -Yup. Whoa! What in the Jim Crow fuck, right? Uh-uh. This is hella disturbing. Why the hell is this in this house? This was not in any of the reviews, but guess what? It's about to be. I don't know but as soon as I get a signal, I'm fittin' to cancel their asses immediately. Yo, AirDrop me all of that. I got you. Say, "Cheese," motherfucker. -Baby, this is wild. -Yeah. How do you even play this game? -Like, what are the rules? -You tryna play? I mean, I'm a little curious. Aren't you? I can't even get you to play Spades but you all over Sambo. Oh. At least Sambo don't renege. Nigga, if you say you don't have hearts, guess what? You shouldn't have hearts. THE GAME: Pick a card. (DISTANT SCREAM) At least we know it's working. -(SIGHS) -Shit probably runs on racism. (LAUGHS DRYLY) Now, that is one battery -that ain't dying no time soon. -That's a sober comment - right there, baby. -Pick a card! Okay, nigga, calm down. I just did. Yeah, and you better watch how you talking to my lady, okay? -Okay. -What you got? "You are a Black character in a horror movie. "Prove that you can stay alive. "Name one Black character that survived a horror movie. "You must answer correctly, or you die." What the hell? So this is just an aggressively-themed trivia game. Hold up, were there even niggas in horror movies -when this game was created? -Baby, you're thinking too much about this, all right? I know the answer. It is Jada Pinkett, Omar Epps, Scream 2. Boom, Sambo. (IMITATES BUZZER) Them niggas was the first to die. What are you talking about? I honestly think that the studio didn't have the budget to keep 'em the whole movie. -Mmm-hmm. -That's why they had to die first. (LAUGHS) All right, let's see what we got here. -We got game pieces. -Mmm-hmm. MORGAN: Wait a minute. Don't this look like my earring? Let me see. Yeah, like, it's the same but different. -(TIMER DINGS) -Your time has run out. You did not answer correctly. But hold up. How the hell does a game know if we answer correctly or not? It don't. Watch this. You watching us, Sambo? Well, yes, I am. It's time to die. (GAME LAUGHING MANIACALLY) MORGAN: Fuck! (GAME CONTINUES LAUGHING MANIACALLY) I can't see. Where are you? Baby? Baby? Keep talking. Morgan, baby, follow my voice. Follow my voice. I'm over here. Okay, you got me. You got me. Come on, come on, come on. Okay, okay. You got me. You got me. (MORGAN WHIMPERS) I'm so scared. (SHAWN SHUSHING) Listen. Is that... Is that breathing? Wait. Let me get my phone. Let me get my phone. Okay. Got it. -Okay. -Okay. Okay. Hello? -(WHOOSHES) -(SHAWN GRUNTS) (GASPS) Shawn? Shawn? Shawn? (GASPS, SCREAMS) Run, nigga. (MORGAN CRYING) MAN: Hey! Peekaboo, I see you. (GRUNTS) -(THE GAME LAUGHING) -(MAN GRUNTS) (MORGAN CRYING) THE GAME: Time to die! Time to die! Time to die! Time to die! (SCREAMING) (CONTINUES LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (RAP MUSIC PLAYING) MORGAN: (ON VOICEMAIL) Hey, guys! Listen, I cannot wait to see you guys. Oh, remember, when you turn on Valley Lane, it's gonna feel like you've gone too far because you in the woods. But just keep coming. Shawn almost got us lost earlier. SHAWN: (ON VOICEMAIL) Man, no I didn't, Morgan. -Don't tell 'em that. -MORGAN: Anyway, I got the games ready. Time to get it cracking! -Oh, shit. -God damn. This whole reunion about to crack, and you know Morgan ain't playing when it comes to the party planning. Okay, because we about to turn it all the way up. -I got some shrooms, molly. -Oh, that sounds good. Ooh, and I got some nice herb in the back. I don't even care. We got the whole crew back, okay? Got all eight of us. We did that, y'all. Pause, pause, pause. Eight? What do you mean eight? I know seven. Who all gon' be there? ALLISON: Bitch, you didn't tell him that Nnamdi was coming? LISA: I was going to. -ALLISON: Really? -LISA: Hell no! ALLISON: I knew it. By the way, -I like this haircut on you. -LISA: Thanks, girl. Hello, bitches. I see y'all exchanging looks. What are y'all shady asses hiding? -Nothing. -Nothing. Matter of fact, y'all are hiding someone. Again, answer my question, who all gon' be there? Who cares who's going? It's been 10 years since we all hung out. We came to have fun. Yes, please. We need some reckless, unadulterated fun. We all desperately need it, -especially you, Dewayne. -Especially you. Okay, you ain't gotta say it like that. (LAUGHS DRYLY) But, yes, you are right. I do need fun, and I am very excited to see everybody. (GIRLS GIGGLING) As long as Nnamdi's not there. He not gonna be there, right? (RAP SONG PLAYING) (DOORBELL CHIMES) (CHUCKLES) Yes, it's that good shit. (GASPS) No, they don't. Rap Snack? (LAUGHS) Okay, Chainsaw Massacre man, I see you. (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) Hey. Stranger danger. -Sorry. -Shanika? Carlton? -Clifton. -Clifton. Yes! Oh, my God, what you doing out here in the middle of nowhere? Oh, come on. Aren't you here for the reunion? Yeah, yes, the reunion. -Yes, I am. -(DOORBELL CHIMES) (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) Wow. Anyhoo, I was actually on my way to the soiree, but I forgot my phone charger, and then my phone died. It's not the end of the world. It's okay. It's fine, right? But then my Hyundai died up the road. -Your what? -Hyundai died up the road. And I get here, they don't even have my charger. They have iPhone, I have Android. -Damn. I'm sorry, that does suck. -It does. -Not the car, the Android. -You're funny. We all know Androids have the superior operating systems. Wrong! That's wrong. But it's okay. I'm gonna help yo ass get gas despite your opinions. Come on. Let's go. And why do you got so much damn toilet paper? You have so many Rap Snacks. That's a lot of salt. Okay, is it just me or is this giving Texas Chainsaw Massacre? ALLISON: I don't know, I never seen that film. White people scare me. -But your daddy is White. -Exactly. And, girl, that's why every single time he gets mad, I'm like, "Oh, Lord, here it comes: murder-suicide." (DEWAYNE AND LISA LAUGHING) ALLISON: You know I'm serious. (DEWAYNE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) ALLISON: (LAUGHING) Oh, God! No! Oh, my God, really, bitch? A cabin in the woods? It's technically a house. -(DEWAYNE LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) -I think it's cute. But she got money. We could have went to, like, a five-star resort. (MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) MAN 1: You're wasting your time. MAN 2: Just answer the question -so I can find out... -What seems to be the problem? I'm trying to explain to him that I'm staying here for the week, I just didn't have the code, but... -Who are you? -Are you a cop? I'm a park ranger, and your friend here is trespassing. No, he's not. LISA: See? Right here. All of our names are listed. We have the home for the weekend. -Told you. -And here is my license. Excuse me. Normally, the Conners only rent to... White people? -Families. -White families. Mmm. You all have a wonderful stay. "You have a wonderful time." He sounds like my dad. Ew. I didn't know park rangers have guns. That is unsettling. Well, that was completely unnecessary. Don't even trip. Can't let the ignorance of his prejudice disrupt our inner peace. -What? -Okay, Gandhi. So when did you get all namaste, King? Is this the same King we went to college with? Of course it is. What is this sensitive energy? (KING SIGHS) Where are Shawn and Morgan at? They texted me. They probably just went out. They'll be back soon. Anyway, happy Juneteenth, niggas! -Happy Juneteenth! -Happy Juneteenth! Happy Juneteenth, Ranger White! -Aye! -(LAUGHING) -Whose car is this? -NNAMDI: Hey, yo! It's... I'm gonna go get my bag. ALLISON: Brother Nnamdi. NNAMDI: Sister Allison Tubman. ALLISON: Good to see you. Sister. -What's up? -Hey. (LAUGHS DRYLY) 'Sup. I gotta go get my bag. So, what's up, y'all ready to party? Yup. Sorry. I should have told you that Nnamdi and I are friends again. Yeah, you should have. But honestly, at this point, it is what it is. But friends. I'm confused, when did that happen? Because last time I checked, that was the nigga that cheated on you again, and again. I'm over that. College was a long time ago. People can grow, Dewayne. Are you saying I haven't grown? Look, Nnamdi and I are just friends, so you can relax. Can we please enjoy this? It'll be like the old days. Party, play some of Morgan's games, party some more. -Fine. -Close your eyes. -Do you trust me? -(INHALES) With my life. Take a deep breath. Now, inhale through your mouth. (INHALES) -Swallow. -Mmm. What is this? Molly. Now, stop being sad and pressed. Time to party, bitch. -Molly? -Yup. -You know that's my drug of choice. -Let's do it! ALLISON: Hello? Yo! Oh, my gosh. This is so cute! I bet you Morgan did this. You know she loves decorating. I bet you they already took the best rooms, too. Oh, my gosh. Shit, look, Allison. Even got a picture of you on the wall, too. (KING CHUCKLES) Fuck you, Nnamdi. That's your ex-girlfriend. You know, the one with the teeth? -Okay. -Uh-oh. You know what time it is when these cards come out? You taking all the Spade fades. You still like losing? If this is how you wanna start the weekend, that's fine with me, gentlemen. Because me and Lisa about to come back and issue that smackdown. Let me go drop my bags, and I will be right back. This is nice. I bet you this is all repurposed wood, too. (EERIE MUSIC PLAYING) (FLOOR CREAKS) (DOORKNOB CLICKS) (DOORKNOB CLICKING) Hmm. This must be where they keep their personal items. -It's locked. -Or maybe it's the master bedroom. And Morgan and Shawn, the couple of the friend group, took it. Okay. Speaking of couples, a little birdy told me that another couple may be in our friend group. I'm not saying, I'm just saying. You're not saying, but you're just saying what, Allison? I'm just saying, Nnamdi, do not break her heart again, and I mean that. I got you. And remember, you gonna have to deal with Dewayne, too. KING: Mix it up, baby. Oh, yeah. Mmm-hmm. This ain't the Blackest shit ever? You know what else is real Black? Diabetes. Ain't nobody drinking that. -We're good. -You know what? I'mma pray that you get all that hate out your heart. And why would you do that? That's what keeps me nice and young. (LAUGHS) Stop playing, you gonna make me drop these. Okay. (CREAKING) (CREAKING) -My brotha. -Hey. Let's go. I call it King's Kool-Ayyy. The fuck, brother. Call it King's Kool-No. -Is it that bad? -Yes, bro. You tripping. Sugar fuck around and give you a cramp. God damn! Shit! (BOTH LAUGHING) Damn. But shit, bro, how you been? I've been good, you know. I feel like everything's starting to fall into place. -Okay. -Got steady clients at the gym. I'm seeing this girl now. Oh, shit. Only one? Yes, bro. Only one. I'm a new man. Wow. You know what I call that? -Mmm. Growth. -Delusion. -What? -You been saying that same thing like, every two years since we met. You do some fuck shit, you feel bad, you reflect, become a new man. But then the new nigga do some fuck shit, and the whole cycle just start over again. Come on, bruh. -This time is different. -This time is different. (LAUGHING) Nigga, you say the same thing every time. You ain't changed. Man, fuck all that bull. What about you? What, you still a slave to the White man? Y'all gonna stop calling my wife the White man, all right? -Her name is Jenny. -Okay. And she ain't "White" White. She ethnic White. -She Armenian. -Come on, man. That bitch is dog-kisses on-the-mouth, pumpkin-spice-latte, Sweet-Caroline, Bye-Bye-Bye White. So, you just gon' call my wife a bitch? Just, come on, bruh. Nah, I meant bitch in the colloquial sense. You know, like, "Hey, bitch. "You gon' finish that quesadilla?" Yeah, no, that was a bad example. All right, look, bruh, I didn't mean... I'm fucking with you. (LAUGHS) -Fuck outta here, bro. -I'm fucking with you. I'm a changed man. (LAUGHS) Shit, look at me. So, you telling me she wrung every bit of the thug out of you, bro? There's not even a little bit left? Like, you really ain't packing right now? (SIGHS) Nah, man. Man, you really in the "Sunken Place." Balls deep, my brother. Balls deep. (ANIMAL HOWLING IN DISTANCE) -LISA: You got a heart? -ALLISON: Nope. LISA: You got that last club, don't you? -ALLISON: Yup, and it's low. -LISA: Got you. Oh, yeah, she love the club. Let me see. Yo, I hate these dudes. I hate 'em. Not a good time. (EXCLAIMS) I knew it, and that might be board. Five. That may be the dagger. Shit. All I got is a... -Dang, bitch! -(BOTH EXCLAIMING) That's my partner, okay? That is what we do on Juneteenth, motherfuckers. -Y'all cheated, man. -So now we cheated? Congratulations. Chivalry's not dead. Oh, oh. Take your L and go. Nnam, that's something a loser would say, Nnamdi. Don't be a sore loser. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) Hey, Dewayne, you wanna run one? Come on, Dewayne. Come on, bro, let's run one. Dewayne, did you just shift in your seat at me, you little moody ass? -What is wrong with Dewayne? -He always does this. First, he gets all introspective and shit, and then 20 minutes later... (DANCE RAP MUSIC PLAYING) I fucking love this song. Are y'all hot? -Kinda hot. -KING: Oh, he needs some water. Yup, that molly finally got his ass. Oh, my God, he is wilding. Oh, I feel like the music is -kissing me on my neck. -(CELL PHONE BUZZING) KING: Nobody kissing your neck. ALLISON: Yes, Dewayne. Come on! You better rip those pants off, Dewayne. Come on, who needs clothes, boo? Yes! No. No. You got it going, Dewayne. (KING CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) (MUSIC AND PARTYING CONTINUE IN OTHER ROOM) (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (CREAKING) LISA: Nnamdi, is that you? (DOOR CLOSING) (CREAKING) Shit! You scared me. (ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING) Hey, what's the problem? I feel bad. Dewayne still doesn't know -we got back together. -Dewayne? (SCOFFS, CLEARS THROAT) Maybe if you tell him, you might realize that you outgrew your friend. Boy. You really thought you just said something. "You realize you've outgrown your friend." You don't know shit about my friendship. -(SIGHS) -Okay. -(SIGHING) Oh, my God. -Are you okay? My molly just hit. Look, I'm sorry I lashed out. I was projecting a bit, but you were overstepping. Now... -take your pants off. -(PANTS UNZIP) (WASHING MACHINE CHIMES, WHIRRING) (SOFT METALLIC CLINKING) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (DOOR LOCK CLICKS, CREAKING) (LOCK CLICKS) Boo, motherfucker! -(EXCLAIMS) -(LAUGHING) Bitch, you play too much.

You so late, move. Hold on! 'Bout to fuck up my Moscato. -This is peach lavender. -Go through the front door. -I love you. -Love you. (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Happy Juneteenth, niggas! Shanika in the hizzouse. Hey. -What's up, Ally? -ALLISON: Girlfriend, hi! Yes, how are ya? It's so good to see you, boo. Put that on ice. -What's up, Shanika? Where you been? -What up, nigga? I got lost, and then my car couldn't make it up that fucking hill. -Y'all, I ran into, um... -Clifton. I have not seen you since we were at the... -SHANIKA: At the one... -I don't know that nigga. -At the... -School. -School! -School! That's what it was. -All right. -Yes. -Well, welcome. -Thanks. I appreciate it. I mean, I'm surprised I was invited, too. Anyway, do you guys have an Android charger? I told you, we don't support that. All right, well, you can't win 'em all. -Thanks for having me. -Y'all, where's Lisa? I know y'all motherfuckers didn't start numbing reality without me, 'cause if you did... (SQUEALING) What up, Lis? You smell like dick. What the fuck you been doing? Oh. That's who you been doing. I accidentally smelled some of the dick. (SHANIKA LAUGHING) Oh, wow. So, Lisa the new girl you was telling me about? (DEWAYNE CLEARS THROAT) Oh, so suddenly it's quiet and all eyes are on me. Is that my reputation? Something happens and y'all just waiting on me to be combative? (EXCLAIMS, LAUGHS) Guys, I'm not even mad, I promise. Lis, I'm tryna be as fucked up as he is. ALLISON: Let's get this party started. Yep. We should all take shots, right? Yes. Please. Get back to handing out these ass-whoopings in Spades. ALLISON: Who are you talking to? Oh, puh-lease. 'Cause you know good and well we've been whooping your ass all night, right, Lisa? Y'all got lucky. Don't let it go to your heads. (ALLISON LAUGHS) -Hey, Dewayne. -Hey. Oh, my God. Gal, it's so nice to see you again. -It's Clifton. -Oh... Yes. Oh, my God, I'm so... I knew that. I'm so sorry. I've taken a lot of drugs. Do you know where I can put my bag? Mmm-mmm. Where's Morgan and Shawn? I got a text last night saying that they made it here. They texted us earlier, actually, and told us that they were gonna come back later on this evening. -Hey, thank you. -You're welcome. -Here, Clifton. -Thank you, baby. -No, hold it, nigga. -(SIPPING) -I have a toast. -Yes! On this Juneteenth Day, I would like to celebrate freedom. -Freedom. -Freedom. Freedom from caring about people more than they care about themselves. A friend of mine once told me, "People can grow." At the time, I didn't know what she meant, but now I know that she meant, "Grow apart." Uh-huh. And then they die. -And that's called fate. -Dewayne. Mmm. Cheers to having standards and self-respect. (CHUCKLES) To friendship for life. -For life. -For life. Lovely. That sounds awesome. (INHALES SHARPLY, EXCLAIMS) Oh, my God, holy shit, King. That tastes like pure sugar. I call it King's Kool-Ayyy. -You drink it, it make you go, "Ayyy." -NNAMDI: Bruh. I love you, but you gonna have to give it up. Okay, you know what? Keep drinking that shit and watch yourself get some cramps. Shut up. Let's get into these Spades. That's why we came here, -right? -ALLISON: Let's do it. So, look, it's gonna be Allison and Lisa, and me and Nnamdi. Uh, can I play? I don't know, can you? Well, can you teach me? Look, come on, bruh, ain't nobody ever teach you how to play Spades? I've played before, I just... -I forgot some of the... -King? Look, man, we ain't got time to be teaching you how to play. You can sit on the sideline, you can watch. If you learn, cool, if not... Yeah, sure, of course. I'll watch. You know what? You can learn, but it's just that you gonna have to be on a team in order to learn. And this weekend, it is women against boys. So, I mean if you're learning, you got to learn from your gender folk. That ain't gonna happen. Yeah, learn from the losers 'cause we finna getting that ass, right? Okay! Bussin', baby. (ALL GROAN) ALLISON: Where are you going? I'm gonna look for the fuse box. -What the hell was that? -What was what? -I see nothing. -DEWAYNE: Was it a raccoon? No, it was bigger than a raccoon. -DEWAYNE: Was it a bear? -KING: All right, we gotta find the lights. ALLISON: Yeah, I'm with King. I'm not gonna... DEWAYNE: Like a bear-sized raccoon? ALLISON: Shut up. Come on. DEWAYNE: I don't know this house like that. It's locked. This one, too. Why are all the doors locked? Let's try this one. Uh, that one's locked, too, bruh. -Well. -Wait, wait. Who put that sign on the door? That was not there earlier, you guys. "Game room." Probably Morgan and Shawn. Probably just came back earlier and are trying to scare the shit out of us. -DEWAYNE: Well, it's not funny. -They think it's a prank or something. -Morgan! -Yo, Shawn, stop playing. KING: It's locked, bruh. It's lock... No, it ain't. Come on. What's this? Oh, hell no. So, the lights just come on when they want to? That works. Game room? Yeah, this is some Morgan next-level party-planning shit, right? They got all the games, too. (SQUEALS IN EXCITEMENT) Etch A Sketch. I used to love this. Oh, hey. I love Ouija boards. One time I tried to summon Gary Coleman and he was not happy. Hey, look at this. It's us from college. Oh, let me see me. Um, I found Morgan's earring earlier. What? These are her great grandmother's. She never takes these off. Okay, then she's definitely here then. See, y'all? Morgan just fucking with us. -NNAMDI: Yeah. -ALLISON: "The Blackening"? Yo, what is this? Jim Crow Monopoly? Whoa. -DEWAYNE: Uh-uh. This game got bad vibes. -(ALL MUTTERING DISMISSIVELY) No. No, thank you. Yeah, Morgan would not plan some stupid shit like this, bruh. Nah, she wouldn't. King, I think this must be yours. -It's a crown. That makes sense. -Huh. -A purse. That's fitting. -Nnamdi. -A pyramid? Why's that fitting? -Because, nigga, you're literally from Africa. Shanika. Why I gotta get a bottle? Because you're literally a drunk. So, wait, they made one of these specifically for each of us? Yeah, I guess. (CHUCKLES) No, no, no, what are you doing? We literally came all this way to party and play games, so that's what I'm doing. Oh, come on, this is clearly Morgan's work. I am not even tripping. Let's just play. NNAMDI: Yeah, I'm with Allison. Everybody falling for this fake creepiness, but I'mma beat her at her own game. Yeah, Morgan, I see you. Game on, bitch. I guess. KING: All right, let's get it. Yeah, let's get it. So, I guess the question is how do we play? Ask the little racist nigga here. THE GAME: Pick a card and save Morgan. The hell? What it mean "save Morgan"? (DOOR SLAMS) (LOCK CLICKS) (DOORKNOB RATTLING) -Shit. It's locked. -That's not funny, King. See, that makes me nervous, and I throw up when I'm nervous. -Move, King. -(STAMMERS) Maybe it's a push. SHANIKA: Talking about it's locked. Your ass couldn't open it, that's why. If you just, um... Did you try pushing it? I think you should push. You just jerk it off. There you go. Nigga, kill yourself. -Y'all, it's locked. -See? See, I told you. -This is why I don't go to fucking cabins... -I'm about to snap. Everyone, calm down so we can figure out what's going on. (TV CRACKLING) (LIVELY OLD-TIMEY BANJO MUSIC PLAYING) Wait, what the... -LISA: Oh, God, no. -KING: Is that Morgan? -Oh, no, Morgan. -Oh, my God. Y'all, we gotta get the fuck up outta here. ALLISON: Oh, my God, Morgan! Allison, you're gonna have to shut the hell up! ALLISON: I'm sorry. Please... THE GAME: Lisa, Nnamdi, Allison, Dewayne, Shanika, King, Clifton. SHANIKA: It said our names, y'all. This shit is "personal" personal. How the fuck is it doing this? The rules are simple. Answer correctly before the second hand completes one revolution, you move a space. If you answer 10 questions correctly, she lives and you're all free to go. Get one wrong, she dies. (MORGAN WHIMPERING) Oh, my God, guys, look. There is someone with her. Refuse to play, and you die, just like Shawn did. SHANIKA: Oh, shit! DEWAYNE: No! Shawn. -Oh, my God. -Fuck. -Fuck. -KING: Now, what? Well, guys, I'm scared, too, uh, but the voice made it very clear. We have an opportunity to save Morgan, so why don't we just play the game? THE GAME: So, shall we begin? (LIVELY BANJO MUSIC PLAYING) I think we have to play the game. (CHIMES) Pick a card. (TIMER TICKING) Okay. "Question one. Who's Sojourner Truth? "A: An abolitionist, and women's rights activist. "B: An entrepreneur. "Or C: Harriet Tubman. Right answer or death." What the fuck? Are you serious? So, he just gon' force us to do a Black history test? I don't understand. Why make us play this game? If you just gonna kill us, just kill us. Shut the fuck up, Dewayne. Look, just answer the question. It's A, of course. (CHIMES) Good for you. You have a point. What you doing? Move all our pieces. My bad. (CHIMES) Pick a card. "How many seasons did dark Aunt Viv play Aunt Viv "in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air before being replaced "by light-skinned Aunt Viv? "Right answer or death." Okay, so, Tyra Banks came in the college years, -and then Ashley started singing. -I know the answer. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) KING: Little Nicky came in season 4, and that was light-skin Aunt Viv, so it had to be before that. -It's three. -Are you sure? Yes, nigga. I'm sure. It's three. - (CHIMES) That is correct. -Whoo! Gosh, team, we're on a roll. We're doing it, really, we're moving and grooving. -Okay. -Let's go. "What does the NAACP stand for? "A. Negroes At Applebee's Cooking Pasta." Oh, my God, this is so offensive. Uh, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. - Fuck you. -Correct. Pick another card. (SIGHS) All right. "Every Black person should be "familiar with the Black national anthem, "Lift Every Voice and Sing. "While every Black person knows the first verse, "sing the second verse, or else." I only know the first verse, bruh. Yeah, same. Honestly, I just be making up words. Nigga, I know the Pledge of Allegiance. That song has like 14 verses. Somebody better fucking sing something. ♪ Stony the road we trod ♪ Bitter the chastening rod ♪ Felt in the days ♪ When hope unborn had died ♪ Yet with a steady beat ♪ Have not our weary feet ♪ Come to the place ♪ For which Our fathers sighed? ♪ -Is that right? -(TIMER TICKING) - (CHIMES) Correct. -Whoo! Yes! -Yo! -Yes! CLIFTON: I'm in love. I'm in love. Al, that was gorgeous. Swag, the gas mask, and a motherfucking pacemaker. -That's 15 Black inventions, right? Let's go. -(ALLISON CHEERS) -(CHIMES) Correct. -(CHEERING) -Okay. -Pick a card. Whoo! Come on. "In Nas' One Mic, subtract the number of blunts, "pages and pens that Nas needs from the number of shots..." -It's Nas. -Nas. "Nas needs from the number of shots that hit the crew." Why y'all looking at me? You finna die if y'all expect me to answer that. Wait, wait, wait, no, I know this one. All right, so, you need one blunt, one page, one pen, -right, which is three. -Yeah. And two twin Glocks, which is 16, which is 32. Jesus was 33, six hit the crew, but 27 went into you. 27 minus 3 is 24. It's 24. -Are you sure? -Positive! (CHIMES) That is correct. (ALL EXCLAIMING) And I like your math. Pick another card. "Name five Black actors that have appeared "on the hit TV show Friends." This is a trick question, right? I should know this, but I was more a Becker kind of guy. Why y'all looking at me? I ain't never seen the show. But I do know Aisha Tyler was on it once, playing the love interest of Joey and Ross. So, that's one. I never watched the show either, but I do know Gabrielle Union was on the show. She was also a love interest for Joey and Ross. SHANIKA: Wait, is that the show about all -the White people in New York? -Yeah, on the couch. Yeah, I didn't watch that shit either. But I do know that Craig Robinson was on it, but I don't know who he played, though. And Mr. Moseby. He played Chandler's boss. Phill Lewis. -Shit, yeah, that's four. -So all y'all watched that show? -We need one more. -Your time is almost up. Um, um, um, dark-skinned Aunt Viv also played one of Chandler's bosses. You know, they were very "plug and play" with the Black people on that show. So, y'all did watch that show? Okay, but what was her name again? -Um... -Queen Janet Hubert. -Yes! -Yes! Come on now, you're my girl. -(CHIMES) Wrong. - (EXCLAIMS) The correct answer was, "I don't know. I don't watch that show. "I watch Living Single." Aw, you can't do that. That ain't what you asked. SHANIKA: Damn! (ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) MORGAN: (ON TV) Help! Help me, please! SHANIKA: Is that thing attached to her head? -No, Morgan. -KING: Oh, shit, he about to scalp her. (RIPPING) -(SCREAMING) -Shit! Ooh, bitch, that's some good-ass wig glue. Now, get the fuck up out of there! (ALL CHEERING) Come on, bitch, you gotta fight for your fucking' life! ALLISON: Morgan, get the hell out of there! (ALL YELLING) We gotta get the fuck outta here. We gotta go. Nnamdi, come help me with the door. I got you. Let's break this thing down. What the... Oh, shit. It's open. It's open? Let's get out of here, guys. Come on, let's go. KING: Move, Clifton. Let's go. None of us motherfucking dying today. DEWAYNE: Move, bitch. Get out of my way. Come on. Check the doors. Fuck! It's locked. Somebody break the window. Yeah, break it. Y'all, move. Duck! (CLIFTON SCREAMS) Fuck! DEWAYNE: What type of glass is that? (PANTING) -This place is like a prison. -Oh, my God. Guys. Look at our cars. (LIVELY BANJO MUSIC PLAYING) LISA: Morgan. (BANGING ON DOOR) MORGAN: Come on! Open the door! (BANGING) She's in the basement! -DEWAYNE: Come on. Move! -LISA: Morgan, we're coming! NNAMDI: Morgan, hold on, we got it. KING: Morgan, hold tight. We gonna get you out. -KING: Let me try it. -NNAMDI: On three. All right, come on. Ready? Pull. Morgan, he's behind you. -Oh, my God, he's behind you. -He's behind her! He's right behind you. Hey, Morgan, he's right behind you. (SCREAMS) No, please! He's walking up the stairs. Oh, my God, he's walking up the stairs. Hurry up, he's walking up the stairs! He's coming up the stairs. Watch out! -Oh, my God, I'mma throw up. -I'm gonna throw up. Oh, my God, I'm gonna throw up. -Somebody, do something. -Somebody better... Do something! NNAMDI: King, where you going? Come on, man, I need help. Morgan, we got you. -You got a gun? -Bruh, I knew you had a gun. Wow, that's profiling. How come you didn't use it before? On what? The TV, nigga? Move out the way. Morgan, stand back. I'mma shoot the lock off. -Y'all be shooting in here. -Morgan. -Y'all see something? -No. You wanna borrow my glasses? Morgan! Hold tight, yo. I'm coming to get you. Morgan, we right here. We gon' get you out. Morgan! Maybe try her last name. -Morgan! -Morgan. (ALL SCREAMING) SHANIKA: Get your... Hey, get your... Fuck! Will somebody fucking help me? Okay! -Oh, shit! Oh, God! -Did I get him? You're like King Arthur. This motherfucker shot me in my shoulder. Take this shit out of me. -Lisa, get a knife. -(SCREAMS) -Okay. This is too big. -Allison, you pull it out. I'm not pulling that shit out. You pull it out. LISA: Wait. Okay. I got a good one! Here you go. -Stab him! -Who, me? Yes, you, bitch. Gimme that. (MAN CRYING OUT IN PAIN) (ALL BREATHING HEAVILY) (SCREAMS) Put it back in. Put it back in! Oh, my God. Are you okay? -Are you guys okay? -I stabbed him. It's over. Everybody, get down! (ALL SCREAMING) Stay down! (GUN CLICKS) He's gone, y'all! DEWAYNE: Okay, let's go. LISA: Get back to the game room. ALLISON: Yes, oh, my God, let's go! Oh, wait, Nnamdi! We need to bring King. -NNAMDI: Come on. -Oh, shit. -SHANIKA: Go. -CLIFTON: I'm fine. (KING GROANING) (SCREAMS) Okay. Fuck, fuck. Allison, get this shit outta my back. -ALLISON: I don't know how. -KING: Allison! -What? -Get this shit out! Take the shit out of his back! Okay! I'm gonna do it on three. One, two... (SCREAMS) -Oh, shit! -KING: Shit! What happened to you, Allison? -(DOOR BANGS SHUT) -(LOCK CLICKS) Bad news. They... He locked us in again. -What? -He locked us in again. -What the fuck? -Oh, God. King! King. Oh, my God, we lost him! Nigga, fuck. Shit, I'm resting my eyes. God damn! Keep talking. Okay, great. Guys, guys, we need a plan. If the killer comes back in here, we're next. Girl, how the fuck did this happen? I was trying to help King. Hey, babe, she's gonna need something to wrap that. Damn. Painkillers. Anybody got any painkillers? Shit. DEWAYNE: Listen, think. Are there any White people who wanna kill us? I mean, potentially all of 'em. I mean, a white guy said he wanted to kill me yesterday. -What? Who? -I don't know. He was just some stranger on Twitter. He was mad at me because I said that the O'Reilly Auto Parts theme song was more culturally relevant than the Star-Spangled Banner. I mean, you're not wrong. ♪ O, O, O, O'Reilly's ALL: ♪ Auto parts ♪ Ow! Ooh, that's a good song. THE GAME: Pick a card. -We're not picking any more cards, bruh. -Are you sure? The outcome of this situation depends on your participation. Wait, what are you doing? Well, we gotta finish the game. -No, we don't. -I would suggest you pick a card. DEWAYNE: You heard what he said. Girl, pick a card. "In your predicament, "the Black character is always the first to die. "I will spare your lives if you sacrifice the person "you deem the Blackest to me." The Blackest? "Choose someone to sacrifice. "You don't play my game, you all die. You have two minutes." No, we're not playing the fucking game. We're done. You have 2 minutes to decide. (TIMER TICKING) It don't even make sense, "the Blackest." That is so subjective. Well, shit, Shanika. She say "Nigga" the most. -Nigga! -See? Well, someone has to get picked or we all end up like Morgan and Shawn. All right, look, nobody should judge anybody in here, bruh. I know you ain't over here trying to argue about who should be the Blackest here, Nnamdi. -What, why? -Because you are a literal African, Nnamdi. You are, like, still in its original packaging Black. I'm sorry, boo, but on paper, you the Blackest. First of all, I'm from Oakland, all right, and my daddy's from South Africa. So, Townbiz, Raider Nation, Go A's, Michael B. Jordan, Fruitvale Station off top, bruh. Mmm. That just makes you Blacker. ALLISON: Mmm-hmm. But if anybody is the Blackest here, it's African diaspora, Angela Rye head ass over here. -Wow, Nnamdi, really? -Yeah! Okay. So, that's what we doing? Because every single time one of y'all make a joke, it's always, "Oh, Allison, you White this. Allison, you White that." But now, when it is the most convenient for you, you wanna use my Blackness? -Absolutely. -Absolutely not, nigga. Because guess what? If we playing this game, my daddy is White with "wha", so it's surely not me. -King? -King? -Yeah, King. -'Cause you the one with the gun and you gangsta. I'm a ex-gangsta, all right? I changed my life. And I'm married to a White woman, so... -That does not help. -You right. I'mma shut up. 90 seconds. Oh, my God, this is not working. I'mma need so much therapy if we get through this. What about Dewayne? Girl, shut your ass up. Did you not hear what I said? Therapy. Black people don't do therapy. Well, actually, Black people are slowly but surely adopting healthier mental health lifestyles. Hey, big fucking deal. No, deadass, big fucking deal. We've come a long way. It's a beautiful thing. -Yeah. -We have. But that's not the point. The point is y'all can't pick me. -I'm gay. -(ALL GROAN) Nigga, you always using that shit. No, no. And just like my homophobic family member says, "Gayness is just whiteness wrapped up in a bunch of dicks," and today, I agree. "Bunch of dicks"? 70 seconds left. -Look, we gotta pick somebody. -We can't. You know what? What about Clifton? SHANIKA: Yeah, why we can't pick his little weak-ass? You over there quiet in the corner, but you did not get invited to this event, but yet you showed up. That is some Black shit, nigga. Blackity Black, bro. Guys, I was invited by Morgan. -How? -60 seconds. Morgan sent me an e-vite. Guys, I can prove I'm not the Blackest. -Prove it. -(SWALLOWS) -I've never seen Friday. -What the fuck? I thought Black Twitter was a type of seasoning. Um, I like Jimmy Fallon without The Roots. -That's wrong. -Um... Beyonce's Super Bowl performance made me unsafe. Same. -I voted for Trump. -(GASPING) -What? -What? -Twice. -(SCREAMING) DEWAYNE: Stop. Stop. Stop. Get your hands... Stop! We have a minute left. Somebody trying to kill us, and arguing is only gonna make it easier. We need a plan. Our ancestors did not die for us to abandon each other, our morals and our Blackness at the moment's notice in the face of adversity. Boy, I know you did not just go into some complete, dramatic-ass monologue when you knew we only had one minute left. Time is almost out. Girl, you talking just as long as me. Shit. 20 seconds. Look, y'all, we just need to pick somebody, all right. And I'm sorry, Clifton, for that dumb-ass shit that you just said, I pick you, bruh. -No. -I pick your MAGA ass, too. -(GROANS) No. -Allison? I vote for Clifton. -King? -This nigga. Bae. Bae. I mean, I guess I don't have a choice. I pick Clifton. Dewayne? 5 seconds. I'm so sorry, Clifton. -I pick you. -(TIMER DINGS) -Your time is up. -Wow. You know, I really thought we connected. You know, if you guys had any more sense, you'd know that this is what the game wanted us to do. To turn on each other. To act like animals. You gave it what it wanted. -All right. -Nigga! All lives matter. (DOOR LOCK CLICKS) (WHIMPERS) -(DOOR SHUTS, LOCK CLICKS) -Oh! -That didn't feel right. -I'll go get him. It's locked again. (LIVELY BANJO MUSIC PLAYING) Do you like Hunger Games? I love the books but you probably don't even read. Uh, maybe we can talk this out, you know. Um... Dang it. (ROD CLATTERS) (ARROW WHOOSHING) (DISTANT SCREAM) Fuck. (LAUGHS MENACINGLY) Oh, my God. Oh, no. Well, I mean, he did vote for Trump. -Twice. -LISA: Oh, my God, is it over? THE GAME: You did not follow the rules. Clifton did not vote. Space revoked. Pick a card. -SHANIKA: What? -Oh, my God, this game is impossible to win. -No. Hell, no! -You have time -to save yourself. -I'm not playing this fucking game anymore, man. You have to save yourself. Save yourself... So, you don't want to play? We refuse. No more fucking games. That would mean you automatically move into sudden death. -Sudden death? -What? The rules are simple. Survive. The door to the game room is open. (DOOR UNLOCKS) You'll have 3 minutes of safety before I open the rest of the doors in the house. Now, are your chances better outside or in? You must choose or face the consequences. Ugh. I hate this bitch's voice! 3 minutes. -(LAUGHS) -(STATIC) -So, what do we do? -What do you mean, "What do we do," girl? I'm not gonna stay in this fucking mouse trap. We got to get the hell up out of here. Why? So he can just attack us outside? Look, Clifton was right. This game has rules, and whatever the hell they are, they have stuck by them, okay? So, if we really do have 3 minutes y'all, we should just run. I agree. We got more room to run outside. We stay here, we just sitting ducks. I don't know about you but I have no interest in getting hunt down in the woods by that psycho! Look, I'm with Allison. We need to take our fucking chances. Let's go, baby, listen. We can cut across the woods and make it to the other side of the road. If we all make it, then we'll all be safe. What movies have you seen? 'Cause that's fucking stupid. Bruh, I haven't watched any movies. I'm just trying to save my girl! (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) Boo, I love you. Why you yelling at me? Listen, arguing is not gon' help us. Everybody, let's go at least get some fucking weapons. -ALLISON: All right. -Are you kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me? Somebody gon' help me the fuck up? Shit, my bad, bruh. SHANIKA: Y'all better come in this kitchen and find something. Shit. Hey, find some weapons. Look for something sharp. -Here. Use these. -Thanks. Wait. Chili powder? Girl, what I'm finna do, cook? Sorry, girl, we ran out of knives. Really? A candlestick? You think you in Clue? Don't start with me. I could fuck somebody up with this. What are you gonna do? Tenderize his ass? At least it's metal, Colonel Mustard. That looks plastic. At least this just has a little weight to it. It has some girth. Shanika, I need some of them painkillers. I got you now. Here you go. -This is Adderall. -What? This is Adderall. -Is this what you gave her? -Yes. I need something else. Here, you can take this. Vicodin. -I'm going. -Whoa, what? No, you supposed to be dead, bruh. This ain't that movie. Look, man, let's go before this Vicodin wear off. Wait, are you crazy? Look at yourself. -I got shot once. -Twice! In the same spot. One hole. It hurt like hell, but I can run. My legs work. All right. You can come with us, but if you start lagging, we ain't carrying your ass. -Fine. -Shit, look y'all. It's real dark out there and I'm still high. -I can't go out there. -Me, too, I'm staying. -Lisa! -Baby, then I'm staying with you. No, it's okay. I understand if you have to leave. -Yeah, go. -Baby, I don't wanna stay... I wanna stay with you. I wanna show you that I'm committed. -Look, we a "us" now. -This Larenz Tate chasing the train ass nigga. Not now, Nnamdi. -I'm boots for Nina ass, nigga. -(BOTH CHUCKLES) Okay, we all know what this means. -Don't you dare, Allison. -I'mma say it. Don't say this dumb shit. -We... (GAGS) -Allison. -We... (GAGS) -Oh, my God. We have to split up. -Oh, my God! -Why? He's not gon' be in two places at once. Oh, see, Allison. I knew you was gonna say that shit but I figured that was just your White side talking. This is not my White half talking, Nnamdi. This is me talking as a whole-ass Black person, who just so happens to be biracial. My "Blackness" should not be in question just because I am simply suggesting that separating might actually help us stay alive. Allison, yes, you do have a point. But do you really think your Black side did them air quotes? That feels exclusively Caucasian. MAN: 20 seconds left! -I love you. -I love you, too. -Stay alive. -Mmm-hmm. Shanika, run them pills, girl. They good. I don't know how much time we have, but if the door does open, this is the one closest to the woods. I didn't know that a psycho killer in blackface was gonna be the person that was here when I asked who all was gonna be here? This feels like the end of Set it Off. (CRYING) I hate this, it feels so sad. You are my sister. My strength. -And my pride. -And my pride. (ALL CRYING) It'll be all right. (LOCK CLICKS) (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) Okay, we good. Bye, y'all. Hey, yo. We should hide. Wait. No, no, no. I don't wanna go in the basement. I don't wanna see Morgan like that. Hey, baby, I'm with Dewayne. I don't wanna see her like that, either. LISA: I'm going to find Morgan. DEWAYNE: Yo! When did we become the kind of people that walk into dark-ass basements? LISA: Nice of you to join me. DEWAYNE: Is that a well? What kind of house is this? NNAMDI: Shit. I'm impressed. Motherfucker's crazy. Wait, wait, wait. What? The road is that way. No, no, no. The road is this way. The lake is that way. What? What the fuck is you doing? Okay, hold up, I feel weird as shit! Okay, I think I need to stop. Guys, just go. I'm just gonna sit here with my feelings. Your feelings? What? Allison, that Adderall got you bugging the fuck out. Come on, Allison. We not finna leave you here. No, just go. Look, I need you to breathe with me, all right? Inhale, exhale. There's a crazy motherfucker out here hunting us like we animals. This ain't the time to be sitting down. I need you to be strong. You got Rosa Parks on your shirt, right? Would she be sitting down right now? I mean, that's exactly what she did. Man, nigga, shut up! Look at me. If you wanna be somebody and if you wanna go somewhere, then you better wake up and... -Pay attention. -That's right, bitch. Now, come on with your injured ass. (DEWAYNE GROANING IN DISGUST) Oh, my God. Please tell me that's some of King's Kool-Ayyy. We both know what that is, man. Okay. -Go. Shit. -Look, you go. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) DEWAYNE: Okay, but where's Morgan? Let's see if we can figure out how this fucker operates before he gets back. (DISTANT SPLASH) (COMPUTER CHIRPS) DEWAYNE: Oh, my God. There are cameras all over this house. He's been watching our every move this entire time. Y'all, look. I thought we were above the Mason-Dixon. -(DOOR CLOSES UPSTAIRS) -What was that? Fucking 'course, he'd go after the darkest people first. (FOOTSTEPS THUMPING) -We gotta go back upstairs. -Really? Okay. Fuck! No. We went the wrong way. See? Allison, I told you. Allison? Allison! Fuck, where is she? Her ass probably high. I don't blame her. I wanna do the same thing. No, King, you gotta stay with me, okay? Look, I can see houses in the distance. Okay, I'mma swim across. They won't suspect it. They probably assume we can't swim anyway. They be assuming right, 'cause I can't. -Wow! Way to be a fucking stereotype. -You know what? You go ahead and hop your little privileged ass in that dark, mysterious water, I'mma climb up this tree. You give me a signal when you get across. Is that something you can even do? I ran from cops, I dodged bullets, I jumped gates. This is easy, all right? Oh, shit. This is really embarrassing. -Get up and help me, God damn it! -Nigga, come on. (GROANS) Don't put your finger in my asshole. -Wasn't this door open? -It don't even matter, yo. We gon' go straight through. Ready? Nigga, move, I'll go first. Okay. Here we go. Okay, I see why you didn't wanna go first. Oh, my God, are you guys fucking line dancing? Wait, hold on. One, two... (SCREAMING) I heard screaming. Is everything okay? Ranger White? Is that you? -In the flesh. -Oh, shit. Is this good or bad? Wait. How do we know we can trust him? No offense. -I'm one of the good ones. -That does not help. They all say that. That actually makes you seem more suspicious. You can trust me. Seriously. If I got an invite to the cookout, I'd be honored, but I wouldn't go. -And why the fuck not? -Because I know my presence in an all-Black space would be a disturbance and undo it being an all-Black space. That's a pretty good answer. -I'm sold. -Mmm-hmm. Works for me. Look, we're gonna lower our hands. -Lower away. -Okay, great. Look, I've never been so happy to see a White savior. Somebody's trying to kill us. Please help us. Please. Whoa. Slow down. A masked killer is after us and two of our friends are dead. -What do you mean dead? -Dead. Dead, meet your maker dead, dead. -Where are the rest of your friends? -We split up. You split up? But you all are Black. -Whoa. Do not get comfortable. -I know you didn't. -Bold move, bro. -Sorry. Don't you need to call for help or something? Okay, try to calm down. I'll get some help. -This is White to base. -(STATIC) White to base. This is White. White. White. (STATIC) That's weird. Runs on a satellite system, should always work. The signal is actively being blocked. That's why we couldn't call out. You gotta believe us. Come with me. All right, get in quick. -Okay. -Okay. I'll be right back. Lock the doors, get down, and don't worry. Dude, where are you... Can we just go? -Where are you going? -Where is he going? Why White people always gotta go where they shouldn't go? (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (ARROWS WHOOSH) What? Nigga, are you shooting arrows at me? No! Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop! King! Stop! (RAP SONG PLAYING) Let's see what you got without that bitch-ass crossbow. What's up? What's up? Come on. Fuck! I'm gonna beat your little ass now. -(GRUNTS) -Aw, hell, you can't even fight? -What? -What's good? MAN: (SINGING) Get your bitch ass up. Get your bitch ass up. This one's for Morgan. -(MUSIC STOPS ABRUPTLY) -Oh! Cramp! Shit. (CRIES OUT) Don't hurt my... Nigga, you can't fucking... KING: Time out. Time out. Oh, fuck! (MAN GRUNTS) SHANIKA: Hey! Stop it! First off, you're gonna watch me kill your friend. -No, no, no... -ALLISON: Hey! Asshole. MAN: Well, come and have a go. (RAP SONG PLAYING) All right, bitch. Let's do this. (ALLISON GRUNTS) -(MAN GROANS) -Hell, yeah. -(SCREAMING) -(GROANS) Beat his motherfucking ass! Hell, yeah! (GRUNTING) Goddamn, beat your ass now. Oh, shit. Nigga. You sure he's not gonna come back to life? -No, girl, he's dead. -Hell yeah, you beat that nigga ass. (SHANIKA GASPS) That's the one-eyed nigga I saw at the store. Hell yeah, run his pockets. What the hell? Wait a minute. He's got asthma. That's why he was breathing like that. Camden Conner. 555 Valley Lane. That's our address. Hey, I feel a bit woozy here. See, this why I don't come to the woods because of crazy White motherfuckers like this. And they always got some dirty-ass shoes on. Wait, the nigga that was chasing us in the house had a different pair of boots on. Remember? I stabbed him in the foot. So, unless this motherfucker got costume changes... That means that there's more than one of them. -We gotta warn the others. -Okay. -KING: Oh, fuck. -King! NNAMDI: Okay, look, y'all, we... we might actually make it out of this, okay? If he comes back. Why the fuck is he looking for the killer? Can we just go? LISA: Oh, my God. Maybe to convince us that the killer isn't him? -NNAMDI: What the fuck? -We gotta go. (CAR LOCK SLIDING) Stop. Stop pressing the button. Both of y'all, stop fucking with the door! -LISA: Shit. -DEWAYNE: Ah, shit! Unlock the door. I don't think I stopped him. He's coming. Unlock the door and let me in. Quick. I know how that looks, but I found that mask in the woods close to here. It's why I came to check on you. Let me help you. You have to trust me. -No, we don't. -Let me in! Let me in! -(GLASS SHATTERS) -(SCREAMS) Come on, man. We're sitting ducks out here, y'all. Maybe we should have trusted him. Okay, he's gonna reload at some point. Should we go back in there? No. We go back in there for what? What other choice do we have? I don't know. I don't know. I don't... Fuck! Okay, now! DEWAYNE: Go, go, go! Come on, come on, come on. Oh, shit. He's shooting! Stay right there. Stay right there. Oh. Just go. Save yourself. DEWAYNE: Go. -We can't... -Let's go. I was joking. Shit! We just left him. What if he's just somewhere bleeding? No, baby, he told us, he told us to leave him. He didn't mean it. Okay, Lis, look. All of us ain't gonna make it through the night. We know that, right? -I'm just saying. -I'm gonna go get my friend. (SHUSHING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (CREAKING) (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) (R&B SONG PLAYING) Who's playing music? Wait. (SHUSHES) You shady motherfuckers left me to die! And I just saved y'all asses. But fuck me, though, right? You told us to leave you. Nigga, you know I didn't mean that shit. -Told you. -Told you, my ass. -You didn't have to follow him. -(CLATTERING) (GLASS BREAKING) Move! Let me get up there. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) How long do y'all think we should wait in here? I don't know. Probably till morning? The fucker a vampire or something? -Why the fuck is morning more better? -I don't know. 'Cause it's bright out and less scary. NNAMDI: That makes sense. I'm sorry we left you, but it's not every day I'm faced with fucking life or death decisions. It's good to know when it comes to me, the decision is death. What is your problem? You've been pressed this entire trip. If you have something to say, say it. No time like the present. I disagree. There is a better time than the present, -and it is not right now. -Every time this nigga broke your heart, I was the one there to mend it. I never asked you to do that. You chose to do that. -(SIGNAL BLOCKER BEEPS) -(CELL PHONE CHIMES) Fuck. What the fuck. Oh, my God. Keke Palmer retweeted my tweet. (CHUCKLES MENACINGLY) Okay, okay, okay. (SHUSHING) (GULPS) (GULPS) -Keep that shit together? -I'm trying. Oh, shit. (WHIMPERING) -Peekaboo. -(RETCHES) (SCREAMS) -(GRUNTS) -(EXCLAIMS) Shit. I'm going to jail. Oh, shit, are you okay? He kicked the shit outta you. (WHEEZING) How'd you know how to do that? Yeah, bro, that seems like an exclusively White weapon. You know what, that's another thing. Y'all are always underestimating me. Maybe that's why you left me at the car. This is exactly why I didn't tell you me and Nnamdi were back together. I just didn't need this negativity. Oh, no, no, no... You didn't tell me about Nnamdi -because you are ashamed. -Ashamed? DEWAYNE: Be real. You have always used my friendship as some fucked up replacement as a rebound guy whenever y'all broke up because it was safe. You knew I would be there. I feel like I wasted my fucking time. 'Cause look at you now, you got your man, your house, and I'm pushed to the curb, again. You have never treated me like a best friend. You've treated me like a gay side chick. You leaving me and picking him proves exactly that. -(ARROW WHOOSHES) -(GROANS) -That's a good shot. -That was the last one. Oh, you're gonna pay for that, bitch. -Ooh. -I got you, bitch. Hey! You got the right one today, bitch. That's for Morgan and Shawn! -This is for King. -His ass. -That's what you fucking get. -LISA: Carlton. -It's Clifton. -Why the fuck Black women gotta save everyone all the God damn time? -Get him, girl. -I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm fucking tired. See, that's why I married a White woman. Bitch, and suck my dick! You're acting just... I don't think you need to... -He good. -Girl, he dead. It's fine. Lisa. Earlier, did you have something to say about my choice in weapons? Oh, no. No, no, no. Nnamdi? No. No. Hell... Absolutely not. Look. (CLATTERS) Maybe I was a little worked up after I realized what my part was in what was wrong with us. I'm sorry I didn't tell you me and Nnamdi were back together. -I love you, okay? -I love you, too. You got guts all over your face, so. Um, look, I'm sorry for pressuring you to commit before you were ready. I was worried that if you kept me waiting for so long that I was gonna... I'm gonna mess up. I love you, all right? (GIGGLES) Dewayne, I apologize to you, too. Yeah, I wasn't a good dude in college. Sorry. Are y'all for real? Y'all doing this right now? Y'all ain't worked out y'all shit yet? Didn't you see how long he was talking? -Why you have to interrupt my apology? -Nigga, it's given that there's another motherfucking killer in the woods that we killed. That's what I'm trying to tell y'all. -Okay, I did not know that. -SHANIKA: Yeah, so, now let's find out who this motherfucker is. Oh, I can't. Dewayne, look in his pockets. Mmm. Player, you got it. This is on you. -You two gonna figure it out! -Okay, I'mma do it. Fuck! Clive Connor. This look like the other nigga we saw in the woods. Who the fuck are they? We found this shit on the other one. Read it. Shit. They're twins. We also found this on him. -DEWAYNE: I don't get it. -LISA: Someone must have been paying them. DEWAYNE: Yeah, that seems about right. They've got all our initials on here, too. So, somebody paid these evil racist twins to kill us all. Is that it? And this is all we worth? It's like $1,000. This is offensive. Oh, my God. We need to get the fuck outta here. No, I'm still not going out there. Okay, you know what? Why don't we just stay here because they've got to come back for Ranger White at some point? I still need to know what happened to Morgan and Shawn. Yeah. Which means that they might still be downstairs. Right. He had a whole command center down there, y'all, like TVs and everything. We can use that to call for help. Y'all are acting real White right now. I think we've already proven ourselves. If there's someone else down there, we'll handle it. Okay, you know what? I'm gonna stay up here and just keep watch with my eyes. Wait. I'm sorry. When you go down there, take this. -Just in case. -Okay, thank you. What the fuck is wrong with her? -Nigga, it's the Adderall. -I'm on Adderall? No, baby, you're not on nothing. -Okay. -(SHUSHING) (BOTH SCREAMING) Stop yelling. Stop yelling. Stop yelling. I've been thinking, they keep locking the doors on us. While we got them unlocked, maybe we should prop them open, so they don't keep locking 'em. Right. Great idea. Right. I'm just gonna... We just have to... -I'm gonna need this one. -Ouch. Hey, Lisa, he's got a note. It says, "You're getting warmer." Poor Clifton. "Fatal accident claims life of local nurse Lateesha Paine, age 29." -What? -"Arrested on the scene, "Clifton Franklin James "was driving under the influence of alcohol and struck Ms. Paine. "Mr. James is to be arraigned on manslaughter " (LIVELY BANJO MUSIC PLAYING) What the hell did he have to do with this? (GASPS) -What the fuck? -What the fuck? -(INHALES) -(EXCLAIMING) No, no, no. I got this whole basement riddled with plastic explosives. Now, one of you guys move and poof! So, if you don't mind, I think I'll give us some privacy. Wait! No! Fuck. King. Shit. King! They locked them in. So, drop your weapons. Now! And big guy, do you mind kicking that over to me? The crossbow? Slowly. I really appreciate it. Okay. This is heavy. Okay. Wait, Clifton, you did all of this, why? I would love to answer that question, truly. But in order to do that, you're gonna have to play my game. Hell no. No, you don't wanna play? You don't wanna play? -Whoa, whoa, whoa. -Come on. Question one. Why am I doing this? Now, listen, you should be familiar with the rules by now. It's been a long night. Right answers only. But we don't know. (IMITATES BUZZER) Wrong answer. Shit! So, hey, Dewayne, the next one won't miss. Gonna ask you just one more time. Question one, why am I doing this? The article about the girl you killed? Ding, ding, ding, ding. Good job, Lis. Good job. All right. Per the article, that happened 10 years ago tonight. Question two, what else happened 10 years ago tonight? It was, uh... The what? Come on. The party. It was the party. It was the Juneteenth party. Ding, fucking, ding. -I remember you got really drunk. -Okay. Lisa and I kept trying to give your ass shots but all you wanted to do was fucking play Spades. The pot was up to $1,000 that night and everybody was acting fucking crazy. Yeah, motherfuckers were fucking tripping. You know, I was just so excited to be around people that looked like me. And I'll be the first to admit, I was never the best dancer, Dewayne, or the funniest, Shanika, or the best cheater, Nnamdi... Relax. Or whatever you do, Lisa. -I'm an attorney. -Congrats. But you know, one thing I love more than all that is games. Monopoly, chess, checkers, Connect Four, whatever you wanna play me in, I'm a monster at it, you know. But the one game I could never, ever really get a handle on was Spades. Because nobody plays Spades in Vermont! So, that night I made one honest mistake. I thought I was out of clubs. Oh, shit. Shit. I remember that. You fucked around and you reneged. And it could have happened to anybody. Not to niggas who know how to play. It was an honest mistake! -What you doing? -Yes! Motherfucker. Clifton! I thought he was dead. I guess he's better at games than we thought. It was a simple mistake. A mistake that you all couldn't let go. You turned it into some ultimatum about how Black I was. And you laughed at me, and you attacked me about my Blackness. And then you ruined my life. Everyone gets shit over Spades, it's not like someone revoked your Black card. No, Lisa, you're incorrect. That's exactly what you said. Your exact words. I remember. You said, "Yeah, nigga, your Black card's revoked." That's what you said. You know, that tracks. You know, I was really honored to be your friend, you know. Until you said what you said. And then I became embarrassed, rejected. And you know what I did? I drank for the first time ever that night, and I drove away to escape the ridicule. And I didn't see this woman in front of me until her body hit my car. If he controlling the locks, who was controlling them when he was with us? I served 4 years in jail. 4 years for manslaughter? That's like, grad school, man. You know, I got a little jealous of seeing the lives you were living, the amazing lives you were living, because my life got taken away. Because I wasn't Black enough for you. I honestly thought that those redneck twins would have gotten the job done, but they didn't. I guess cheap labor is cheap for a reason. Anyway, I'm gonna kill you guys now, and I'm gonna dispose your bodies the same way I did Morgan and Shawn's, in the well. -Nigga! -Nigga! Nigga indeed. -Got it. -Yeah. Oh, fuck. Okay. -I don't know which one... I don't know which one. -Try that one. How about once and for all we find out which one of you is the Blackest? I'm gonna call this round, Black Sophie's Choice. And remember, you brought this on yourselves. You know, for a moment, I actually thought maybe you changed, maybe, until you sent me out to die. And why? Because I wasn't Black enough? It was mainly just the Trump thing. Shut up! Lisa, pick! Who is the Blackest? And remember, the one you choose is gonna die. We're not playing your game, you just gonna kill us anyway. -So, just do it. -NNAMDI: Fuck your game, bruh. I actually think we should keep playing. You know what, I'm with Shanika and Nnamdi. At this point, you've been fucking with us -this entire night. -That's right. So, your non-Black, coon, MAGA ass can kiss my Black ass. As a matter of fact... (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) -DEWAYNE: Do you trust me? -LISA: With my life. DEWAYNE: Okay, then play the game. SHANIKA: ...your little ass crossbow. I should flick your little ass across this goddamn basement. Okay, I'll play your game. Wait, what? Baby, what? Lis, how the fuck you just gon' change your mind like that? I'll play your game. Yes! Finally, we have a competitor. Now, go ahead, choose. Which one's the Blackest? -I choose myself. -Wait, baby, what? What? No, that's not what I... What I said. I said choose one of them, one of them. Choose one of them! Go! Now! Those are the fucking rules, Lisa! Pick! DEWAYNE: Psst. Nnamdi. -NNAMDI: You talking to me? -DEWAYNE: Yes. NNAMDI: Yo, this is trippy. I didn't think this mind talking worked for the guys, but go ahead. DEWAYNE: I need you to hit him low. NNAMDI: Wait a minute. What? DEWAYNE: I said hit him low and I'm gonna hit him high. Choose one of them! Choose one of 'em! Choose one of 'em, Lisa! -NNAMDI: He's crazy. Are you sure? -DEWAYNE: Yes, nigga. I'm sure. LISA: You heard me, I choose myself. -NNAMDI: Okay. -I refuse to play your game. DEWAYNE: Wait, did you hear all of that? CLIFTON: Yes, motherfucker, I did. DEWAYNE: Oh... CLIFTON: You done fucked up now! (GULPS) You guys just gave away the only thing you had going for you. And that was the element of surprise. It's fine, Dewayne. It's okay. Because luckily, I still have mine. No, no, no! -Shit! -Oh, my God! No, no, let him bleed. Let him go! Let him go! -Let him bleed. Okay? -Fuck you. Lisa, I don't think you've fully grasped the gravity of this situation. So, I'm going to repeat myself one last time. Which one of your friends is the Blackest? I, I... You can try two at a time. What was that? Hey. I got... Stay right there. Stay right there! Oh! No! Oh, my... Okay. Time out. -What the fuck? -Watch my ear! Let go! Shoot him! -Shoot who? -Him! -Shoot him! -Who's him? -Shoot him, Shanika! -Nigga, it's dark! -The one on the left. -The one on the right! Wait, who's on the right and who's on the left? -To the left! -CLIFTON: Your right. -SHANIKA: My right? -DEWAYNE: Your left! Dewayne, I don't wanna shoot you. Say something gay. Bitch, that is offensive. How fucking dare you? Got it! You're gay? -Wait, wait, wait. -What, what? KING: I don't know. I can't see anything. (EXCLAIMS) Yes, motherfucker! Yes. (CLIFTON SCREAMING) (DISTANT SPLASH) -Okay, come on, -we fucking did it. -Let's get it! (BOTH GROAN IN PAIN) -Fuck, wait a minute! Damn! -Fuck. (DISTANT SPLASH) Ain't that some poetic fucking justice. I guess he's not doing too well. -Dewayne. -You see what I did there? Somebody's dead, nigga. -That's a good kick, bruh. -Thanks. Told you we'd handle it. -There is an arrow, it's okay. -I'm sorry. (CLIFTON LAUGHING MANIACALLY) We did it. We survived. -So, what do we do now? -Call the cops? (ALL LAUGHING) SHANIKA: Oh, shit! Hey, but for real, though. (RAP SONG PLAYING) We can always call and act like White women. -LISA: Mmm. -(KING GIGGLING) When they get here expecting Hannah, Kailey and Kimberley and see our Black asses and it's bang, bang, then what? You right. Any other ideas on how to get help without getting shot in the process? I got it. I'm a genius. (CHUCKLES) So, why did we decide to do this? Oh, because firemen won't shoot you. You see? It's called beating the system. I know I'm high as fuck, but, nigga, did you change your clothes? Yes, I did! The news might come. We might be on TV. -As a highlighter? -(FIRETRUCK SIREN APPROACHING) Oh, shit. SHANIKA: Dewayne, you was right. Here they come now. (ALL GROAN)
