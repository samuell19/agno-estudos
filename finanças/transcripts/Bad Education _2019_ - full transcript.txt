(indistinct chatter) (microphone feedback) Bob Spicer: Well, thank you, thank you all, parents and town advocates alike, for joining us on this very special evening. We're here tonight to kick off our most ambitious school year yet. We've run the numbers, and folks, there's no simpler way for me to put it. Our children are getting smarter. (laughter) Harvard, two. Dartmouth, two. Yale, three. U Penn, seven. Thank you. (man continues indistinct) (mutters) (mutters) (sniffs) (classical music playing) (man continues indistinct) ...and my fellow trustees who wait all year long ranking the top public schools in America based on SATs and college acceptance rates. And Roslyn is four... (cheers and applause) And now, I'd like to bring out the man responsible. - Congratulations. - Thank you. In his ten years here, he's revamped our education system. From pre-K all the way to high school. Please join me in welcoming to the stage our district superintendent and my friend, Frank Tassone. (cheers and applause) (stirring music) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (brakes hiss) Good morning. Hey there, good morning. Go Bulldogs. Frank: Have we heard about Mr. Kopple? - Wife had twins. - Twins! - Late last night. - Nice. Send over flowers and maybe an edible arrangement. Can we, can we get these things out of here? - Oh, they're nice for morale. - Yeah, it'd be even nicer if they were shaped like ones. - Pam: You know, Dr. Tassone... - Hey. A wise woman once said it's not having what you want. - It's wanting what you got. - Mrs. Gluckin. I barely recognize you anymore what with the new name, new office, new job title. The same pay, same paperwork. July and August are all settled up. - Expenses booked and archived. - Perfect. And something else I wanted to talk to you about... Safety gates are all taken care of. I'm meeting with City Hall later today to go over strategy. Jeez, someone's had their coffee. - Yeah. - Jenny: Uh, Dr. Tassone? - Yeah. - Uh, did you want your flight to the Vegas conference Friday out of JFK or Newark? Thanks, J. Whatever's cheaper works fine. And, uh, Mary Ann, is there any way you'd be able to grab my diet smoothie? - I was running late. - Mary Ann: Oh, sure. - Uh, but there's one more thing. - Frank: Uh-huh. Carol Schweitzer's been camped up in the conference room since 6:30. Says it's urgent she speaks with you. Okay, okay. Um... - Chad. - Chad, Chad Schweitzer's... okay, I'll take care of it. - Thanks. - Good luck. Stop it. Do us all a favor. If he's not out of there in an hour, call 911. (chuckles) Carol: And I am banging down doors until somebody here takes me seriously. All right? That Militzok, she plays favorites, okay? She wouldn't even let him take a bathroom break during the test, and he has a hyperactive bladder. Chad, honey, tell him how you... you know what, I have a note here from his doctor, okay? Ms. Schweitzer, just, just calm down. - Let's, let's just... - No one will listen to me. All right, I don't know what else I'm supposed to do. Chad, he is just as gifted as everyone else in his year. - Absolutely. - And... I'm scared, Dr. Tassone, because if he doesn't get into OMNI... and he starts to think of himself as less than... No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, I will talk to Ms. Militzok. I will straighten this whole thing out. - You will? - Yes. And, and we'll just set a make-up test for Chad. All right, with ample bathroom time. Thank you, Dr. Tassone. I can't tell you how much I appreciate that. There's no need to thank me, all right? Chad's a smart kid with the world ahead of him, and it's our job to give him the runway. Thank you. It's funny. You know, Chad, when I was your age, I didn't even place into fast track math. - Really? - No. I couldn't nail my times tables. And at the time, I thought my world was ending. But I caught up. You know what? Now I set the math curriculum. (light orchestral music) ♪ ♪ (exhales) (knocking) Can I help you with something? Oh, no, it's okay.

He's doing bio-chem. Ah, well, they have great journalism there, too. Yes, they do. - (chuckles) - Um... okay, so they just, they want me to write an article about the SkyWalk proposal in the new budget. And I just need a pull quote from administration. Yeah, oh, okay. A sound bite, nice. Um... (clears throat) We've been asking high schoolers how we can make their day easier, so we came up with this idea, the SkyWalk. Um, a bridge, to link the school from end to end. And um, it's a huge undertaking for us. And we can't wait to break ground once the plans are approved next May. Great, that's all I need. Thank you so much. That's it? No, no follow-ups? No, it's just a puff piece. They save the real stories for seniors. Rachel. It's only a puff piece if you let it be a puff piece. Oh, uh...

You're in my daughter, Becca's year, right? - Mm-hmm. - Say hi to your dad for me. Nice to meet you, Rachel. And if you want to follow up, just set a time with Mary Ann, okay? And, uh, I'll be keeping an eye out for your byline. The demand is insane. It's skyrocketing. We're seeing three bedrooms go for over a million in Roslyn Heights. Yeah, you just don't see those kinds of numbers in Syosset or Jericho. Right, but those towns are a further commute from the city. Not Manhasset, not Great Neck. It's the public schools. The better the school system, the higher the price tag on the homes, period. Bob: Our firm has sold nine separate lots in that area since the report in that journal came out. And, uh, here's a little something - you know, from all of us. - Frank: Okay. Oh, wow.

I can't eat these. Just, if you put them out for everybody to pick at, that'd be great. They were out of the flax seed. That's okay, that's okay. Thanks. (slurps) How much do you figure a guy like Bob makes at his regular job? - Pam: Bob Spicer, you mean? - Mm-hmm. Oh... high sixes a year, minimum. Maybe seven figures in this market. - Why? - Oh, forget it. You look tired. (sighs) You might wanna go home early, get some rest. I gotta run Dickens. Maybe I'll try and bow out and get a headstart and early prep for Vegas this weekend. - I wouldn't bail on book club. - Why? Those women adore you, and each one talks to two dozen more. The next budget vote's only nine months away. - Right, our SkyWalk. - Yeah, the SkyWalk is big. Gets us to first. That's all that matters. (slurps) This new diet is kicking my ass. What is that, even? It's got charcoal in it or something like that. Yeah, coal. I would kill somebody for a carb right now. I don't know where you could find one. You are such a bitch.

Is he in this room? No, he's in his bedroom, isn't he? - Just... - Don't touch me. - Don't touch me! - All right! Hey, Ma. Hi, Ma? Hi, Ma? - Hey, Aunt Pam! - Get outta my house, Jimmy! - Pam! - I don't want you here anymore. - Get the hell out! - Pam. - I don't wanna see your face anymore. - Pam, stop it. - Stop it, you don't mean it. - Hey, what's going on?

Amber: I don't get it, can't you just get a different job at another school? They're taking my license. Mom, what did you do? (sighs) I took money from them. Yeah, I stole. We all did. Howard: Okay, look, just go back to your rooms, please. - Yeah. - Please let me talk to your mother. Your car, your clothes. This house, the other houses. - What are you talking about? - You didn't want state school. You wanted private college. I wanted you to be happy with me. Pam, Pam, listen. It's okay. We'll get you a job down at the dealership, okay? Yeah, yeah, they're looking for a new girl at the front desk. - Like a secretary? - No, no. Not, not as... not like a secretary.

Could I get the key to the basement again? I just want to look up a few more things. What's this for, Rachel? Rachel: Just for some stuff I wanted to verify. I can answer your questions. Uh, okay, well... I did the math, and it looks like the SkyWalk is gonna end up costing around eight million dollars. - Seven-five, sure. - Right. It just seems like a lot of our resources to be spending on cosmetics. Cosmetics? People love the SkyWalk. "The Beacon" loves the SkyWalk. There was that nice poll you guys did. Right. But the ceilings at the high school are still leaking. I mean, some of the classrooms had to get shut down. Sounds like you should bring that up with your student government. There was also the pizza oven. - What? - I saw a line item in the expense reports for a pizza oven. But then I asked Paula in the cafeteria and she said she knew nothing about it. Just stop it. I am sorry to be the one to tell you this, but no one is keeping anything from you, okay? On the contrary, we come in here every day at the crack of dawn because we care. We care about providing you with a proper quality education because we're good people. Because we want you to have a good life. Okay? Okay. Pam: Okay. The individual purchase orders are still public record, though. (chuckles) (opens drawer) Pam: Here you go. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Oh, and Rachel. You were right about that pizza oven. It didn't go to the high school because we bought it for the middle school. Yeah, they have pizza for days down there. Go get yourself a slice. Frank: Morning. - Hi. - Oh, hey, Rachel.

We're just doing some shuffling and we could really use an extra hand down there. Okay? What about Pam's old job? You know, I thought maybe, uh, you know, like a manager, maybe I could be... Maybe I could be right for that. Yeah, well, actually, Philip Metzger's gonna be stepping in as the interim business manager. - Phil the auditor? - Yeah, yeah. I mean, until we can find a more permanent replacement for Pam. But... we're pretty excited about him. I think that I should, uh... think, um... I know what you all did to Pam. And I could, you know, I could... maybe tell people. Frank: Sorry, hold on a second. I'm so sorry to interrupt. I just noticed that necklace you have on. How it really complements your eyes. - Thank you. - It's, uh, yeah, that's, that's new, isn't it? I don't think I've seen you wearing it around before. Yeah, I thought so. Yeah. I've got...

Yeah, I think so. Okay, thanks, Jen. (door opens) (chuckles) (paper crumples) Mary Ann, can I get a cup of that new coffee in here? (doorbell rings) Amber: Oh, Rocco, you're so annoying.

You think back over the smaller moments, over the years where he just seemed... I don't know, he just seemed so real. So real. Oh, thanks. (indistinct chatter) - No, I know. - I know you do. (dramatic music playing) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (alarm buzzes) (indistinct PA announcement) Bob: The outgoing seniors. They're going to the Ivy League in unprecedented numbers. It was the first year on record that we had admission offers from each school going up! And what changed? What makes our little public school so different from all the others like ours on Long Island? Let alone in the country at large. At the end of the day, I think it boils down to integrity. Integrity in our faculty, in our classrooms and curriculum, and our approach to a broad-minded, hands-on education. That's all the stuff that gets thrown around all the time, sure. But never in my career have I seen such passion for all these factors. And then, paired with the willingness to think big. You know why you're here. You know what this means for our town. But I'm gonna tell you about one man who's a hero without whom none of this would be possible. You don't get to number one overnight. It takes years of hard work. And this is really a man who knows what it means to work together. (continues, indistinct) Before Frank Tassone... (muffled dialogue) There was no community service. There was no public outreach. There was no SkyWalk. This is a man who has given the school so much. Woman: Magnificent. - Congratulations. - Bob: Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the man who whipped our kids' schools into shape and got us all the way to number one!
