Come on, people. The table is ready. I'm coming. I prepared the most amazing dinner for you all. Let's take a look. Şule, what is this? It's parrot, Sadi. Just parrot. A unique delicacy from Indonesian cuisine. I learned it at the ethnic-delicacies workshop. Baked beans would be enough, for God's sake. Come on, Sadi. Stop criticizing everything. Get used to trying new things. Dad's right, though. I don't want us to get sick. This Indonesian cuisine looks weird. Yeah, Mom. We've been eating strange stuff all week. I'm sure they're delicious. Şule made it after all. Thanks, Aykut. Wow. You've made them look exactly like snails, though. Honey, they are snails. Tell us, kids. Is the date set? Don't leave it to the last minute. A month will fly by, you know. It's all set, Sadi. Don't worry. Stop pushing the kids, Sadi. You know the circumstances, Şule. Dad's right. We were going to marry even if it weren't for the inheritance. Yeah. Because we love each other. Brother, I can stop by any time I want when you're married. We'll have breakfast and dinner together all the time. I'll never let you miss me. I know, Mithat. The kid's set on not letting us be together. -Mithat. -Son, you can't do that. Aykut, son, this is a difficult process. -If you ever need anything-- -Thank you. Everything's set, Sadi. If you could just handle him… -Mithat. -Son. We don't want a big ceremony anyway. Just something small with friends and family. -Right? -Yes. Not that I have either since I'm an orphan. You guys will have to figure that out. One table is enough for me. Aykut, you're like our son, honey. -Yeah. -I call you "son," don't I? I call you "brother." It can't get better than that. Enough already. You've been talking about how much you love Aykut every night. -I love you too-- -Aykut, please. -I'll get it. -I wasn't going to, man. You know how everyone has that thing they're so glad to have? This is it for me. I'm so glad I'm the son-in-law of this family. I'm so glad I didn't shut that door. -Brother-in-law? -See? He can't stand not being around me. I'm glad I'm your brother-in-law. Brother-in-law! He can't stand being without his brother-in-law. Do they treat brother-in-law addiction? Because the kid needs treatment. See how excited he'll get. What is it, my beloved brother-in-law? I wasn't talking to you, man. He wasn't? -Who was he talking to, then? -About what? -Who? -To whom? -Who? -What? Who was he talking to? It has to be you. Who else? Who is it? It has to be you. Here's the world's sweetest, best, most honorable family. Good evening, Atabeyoğlu family. Who's this? Dilşah, baby, my golden mimosa, look. Didn't you miss me? -Aykut, hold my sister. -Here I am. I'll kill you. -Dilşah. -Stop. -Aykut. -Dilşah, stop. -Aykut, hold her. -Sis! -I'll kill you! -Dilşah! Dilşah, come on. -My golden mimosa-- -Don't you dare! Please calm down. -Calm down. -Stop. -Who the hell is he? -Dilşah! Wow! Since when are we throwing snails at each other? -Get out! -Stop. -Leave! -Calm down, honey. I missed you, Mithat. -Me too, brother-in-law. -Brother-in-law? Oh, wow! -Mithat! -He took the flowers. Do you have a brother-in-law fetish? Honey, don't let him handle you like that. Who is he, even? -He's Aykut. -We'll talk. -Aykut! -Who the hell is he? Dad? Sude? I missed you so much, Dad. I missed you too, baby girl. Give me a kiss. See if you like it, my daisy. Do you like it? Let me introduce my sister's loving husband, Talat. -Come inside. -Loving husband? She threw the pot at him. -My golden mimosa-- -Don't. As you wish, honey. Shut up. Here she comes. I'm so happy for you, Mrs. Sude. Didn't you tear into him a bit too much? The poor guy couldn't get a word in. Talat's anything but the poor guy, baby. Where the hell have you been? They scammed me abroad, Sadi. They took my passport and my luggage. -I couldn't explain to them-- -Shut up. You could've called, damn it. They took my phone too. They use euros, so I couldn't buy one. I have good news, though. Someone's going to buy my land. You don't know how bad things are. I'm knee-deep in trouble. The company is sinking. We're about to lose the mansion. I know. The economy is terrible. -If there's anything I can do-- -You're all talk. -Do me a favor. -Sure. Stay away from him, okay? Why? You tend to see the good in people. Ms. Gülşah, shame on you. What's that supposed to mean? Am I naive? A moron? -Of course not. -I'm a tradesman. I can size people up from a hundred yards away. You took the money Dilşah saved for Sude too. I didn't touch that money at all. I'll return it to her as soon as possible. Since you didn't spend it, bring it back, then. Tomorrow. -Tomorrow? -Yes. Since you didn't touch it. -Sure. I'll bring it tomorrow, Sadi. -Damn you! What's going on? Not in front of strangers, Sadi. You wretched man. Good night, Sadi. You… -Good night, kids. -Good night, Sadi. Sister. -He seems so upbeat, though. -Aykut. -All right. -We talked about this. -I'll go check on her. -Go ahead. We'll talk tomorrow. Aykut? Promise me we won't become that. Especially you won't become him. Ms. Gülşah, it seems you have forgotten. My name is Aykut Aslan… And lies are your biggest enemy. I know. See you, then. -See you. Good night. -Good night. -I'm a big fan of yours. -And I'm yours. -I love how protective you get. -You do? Get inside before you catch a cold. You're my world. Listen to me, friend. I was just saying that to Gülşah. I told her you seemed friendly. I think there's some trouble-- I need to talk to you as soon as possible. You want me to play the mediator? -I'll do whatever I-- -Tufan, I'll call you later. All right. Okay. What's up, man? Sorry. I didn't see the phone. I'm Aykut. The one who was holding your wife. You know, Dilşah. I'm kidding, man. I recognized you. I'm so sorry for the scene in there. It happens in every family. I was going to come meet you, but you and Sadi were a bit tense. -I didn't want to-- -We're always like that, honey. He keeps insisting I drop Sude at school every day. He says I'm the best when it comes to it. So that's why Sude was all smiles when she went back in. I saw the gift too. You're so kind. And you? Are you Gülşah's boyfriend? -Yeah. -Again, I'm really sorry. Don't even mention it. This won't do, though. -I'll give you my card. -Sure. We have a phone shop in Selimiye. -MyHome Phone Shop. -Oh, yeah? It's a popular place. Ask anyone, and they'll point you to it. Thanks. I doubt I'll be there, but still. You know, if you happen to be there. I thought we could maybe talk and stuff. Good night, brother. -What did you say? -I said, "Good night." The other thing. "Brother." Oh, that. Good night. He called me brother. Wow. I have a new brother-in-law. Aykut! Don't bother me. I'm getting married. I'll drop by later. Lütfü! Bring your wife too. Sure, Aykut. Don't be like that, man. It's for sure this time. There'll be a dinner party too. Don't bother, son. The wedding's happening, Avni. Be there. Congratulations. GÜLŞAH AYKUT Korcan, look. You remember the old engagement photos we took? -With the horses. -Yeah. What the hell was that? I want you to delete them. Delete everything from that shoot. All right? Fevzi, my man! You know the deal. Aykut, if it's absolutely happening, just tell us in the morning and we'll show up. You're all so funny. Fuat promised me. You're leading the dance now. Consider it done. We'll see. What's up, Chubby? -Morning, boss. -Morning. -Any customers yet? -Not a single one, boss. Yeah? Why are you so cheerful, then? Never mind. Go get us some tea. Right away, boss! You rascal. Hey. Hello, brother. -Wow! -Yeah. Brother! My brother-in-law's here! He's here. -Hang on a second. -Sure. One more cup of tea, Chubby! Right away, boss! Go on. It's like trying to break the record for the slowest man on earth. -He's always like this. -It's okay. -What's up, brother? -I thought I'd stop by. I'm glad you did. -Backgammon? -Love it. I couldn't even start playing, man. Sorry, brother. I know my backgammon. I didn't even stand a chance. You did well. You should've seen how I destroyed Hüseyin-- Never mind that now. Tell me. How is it going with Gülşah? We're going down a fortunate path. -Congratulations. -Thanks. I heard you were in Greece, right? Yeah, for a small land deal. I had some trouble, but it's okay now. I heard. The family is mad at you. No, honey. -We're always like this. -Yeah? Dilşah is a bit short-tempered sometimes. I'll take her to Italy. Rome, Milan, Venice… A shopping spree will fix everything. You know your business, man. You're sly. SADİ ATABEYOĞLU You two should join us. -Join you where? -In Rome. In Rome, man. Gülşah loves the city. I'm sure she told you. She never did. I'd love to, man. I've always wanted to visit. I even applied and got my passport some time ago. I tried so hard, but I couldn't get a visa. I see they didn't tell you about me. Well, I heard all the negatives. Didn't they tell you I was a connoisseur in the industry? Didn't they tell you how I could get you in any resort anywhere with a single call? They never talk about any of this. -Pick somewhere. Don't even think. -Konya! Okay, think. Anywhere in the world. I don't know, man. I just thought of Konya. It's a nice city. I don't even have a visa, so-- Watch how Talat does business. -Who are you calling? -Wait. -Please. -Don't bother. Hello? Hey, Tufan. Are our guys at the agency right now? -Are they there? -He'll tell me now. I'll give you his info. Write it down. He's not some guy. My brother-in-law. Don't you have an older one? I couldn't get a new one. -You know, the shop-- -I'll handle it. Won't a photo work? -Man, just-- -I see. I'll bring it. -No, man. -Okay. I will. We used to do it over the phone, but the law has changed. -Will you be here tomorrow afternoon? -I'm always here. You'll have your visa tomorrow, then. You're joking! I'm getting a visa tomorrow? I won't forget this. We're like brothers now, man. That's how I felt yesterday. I knew we'd be inseparable right then and there. Consider it my wedding gift to you two. Thank you, man. You hungry? We could order etli ekmek. I'm on a diet. -How about a stew? -I'd better go. -Please don't take it the wrong way-- -What? -It's not much-- -No way. What are you doing? -It's fine. -Come on, man. -I can't. -I'm sure there are costs. All right, then. I'll give it to the boys at the agency. Take care, then. You… God bless. What a brother-in-law. He has a heart of gold. The tea, boss! Don't ever tell me I'm short-tempered again. We played three games, man. Even though he's a busy guy, he'll get me a visa in a day. What did I do? I couldn't even get him tea in a day. I'm just glad you arrived before I went to Italy. You know how I am You don't know who Aykut is yet. I'm insane I fear nothing I'll set Rome ablaze if I have to I'll find you again and again And I'll be yours ATABEYOĞLU You know I will The best brother-in-law ever is here. Don't be like that, Mithat. Every brother-in-law is good. Good evening, Atabeyoğlu family. -Welcome, honey. -Thanks. -Coffee's ready. Want some? -Espresso, please. You know, Italian. Right, Şule? It's best to have it in Italy, but who knows… You'll be so surprised. You don't have to play with it just because your dad got it. Aykut, I made some sushi. You want some? You know what, Şule? I had airan at the shop. I don't want to get food poisoning. Unbelievable. Look at the gift he gave to the valedictorian. -I think you're being too hard on him. -Don't you dare! Just don't, Aykut. Stop bringing up the topic, honey. She's very fragile. All right, Perihan of Rome. What? I'm just saying. He might've made mistakes. -If we make an effort-- -Let's talk, Aykut. -Did I say something wrong? -Of course not. Please stop talking about Talat. He's getting on my nerves. He seems like such a sweet guy, though. Son, he has a gambling problem. But there's a gambler in all of us, Sadi. I buy lottery tickets. Son, he's addicted. He destroyed himself. -Really? -Yeah. Exactly. He was such a nice guy before. We don't know how he got so into it. When I first found out, I cut him off. That's the right thing to do. But then he started swindling people. -Gambling does that to you. -I caught him twice. I didn't tell Dilşah. She'd be so upset. It wouldn't help anyway. Right. I do have a question, though. How can he afford all the gambling? -No one knows. Please don't tell them. -Of course. -Keep it between us. -Sure. -Talat… -Yeah? He tricks poor saps into giving him their ID, then marries them to women who need residence permits. The women pay for it. I pushed him a little bit last night. He said he quit, but I'm not sure. -Maybe he did-- -The fuck he did. -What? -I'm sure he didn't quit. They never do. They're heartless bastards. How does one give their ID to another guy out of the blue? How stupid do you have to be? That's what I can't figure out. Don't say that. Who knows what he told the poor guy? Maybe he told him he'd bring it back. Who knows what he promised? What can he promise anyway? He's not good at it either. You have to be a moron to believe him. Plain and simple. Sorry. I didn't mean to burden you. I wanted you to know. Don't get anywhere near Talat, son. Oh God… What are we going to do? -Brother? -Aykut! -Son, are you okay? -I'm fine. I don't have any fuchsia cases. -Honey, are you okay? -I… -I need to go to the shop. -Why? Chubby texted me. The shop's very busy. -I'll drive you. -It's crowded. No! I can drive. No problem. Does he have low BP or something? MYHOME PHONE SHOP CLOSED CASES "I gave someone my ID." "Could they have married me to someone?" He gave a copy of his ID in order to get a phone line. They ran him up two million liras of debt. On top of it all, the swindler was Dinçer Gülmez's relative. They say you shouldn't even trust your own father nowadays. The debt includes hair implants… -Unbelievable. -…marriage, having kids, and lots of transactions. The swindlers' last trick was to marry Dinçer Gülmez to a foreign woman. How can I even talk to her? With gestures? It won't work. Our law enforcement saved my skin on this one. -God bless them. -Law enforcement! Dinçer Gülmez lives… -Law enforcement! -…on the streets now. What happened to us, sir? We used to be able to trust people with our lives. I gave him my ID for a minute, and I have a wife now. Who knows what else I have? The issue is very clear, Aygün. It's Aykut, sir. Thank you. We'll zero in on it. Please be quick, sir. My wedding's next month. I won't take any other cases. That's what I would do if I were you, sir. I'll call you when I know something. -We can't ever repay you for your service. -Thank you. Thank you so much. I don't know how to repay you. I'm glad we have you. Sir, you need to interrogate the suspect. I'll be right there. You think you can solve it by tomorrow? I'll mobilize the entire department right away. I'll mobilize the entire department. Mithat! Come here. Brother? I need your help, Mithat. It's life and death. I'd die for you, man. Don't die for me, Mithat. -Someone's plotting against me. -Let's bust them. Stop acting brave. Just listen. -Look… -Aykut? Hi, honey. I was going to pick you up after I drop Sude off. What for? I have a surprise. You do? What kind of surprise? Telling you would ruin it. No, sis. He needs me-- The woman I love has a surprise for me. I don't have time for you. Go be young with your friends, man. Off you go! Let's go. You can call me when you're in trouble, but don't call me when you're bored. I'm so sorry, Mithat. I'll be back in ten minutes, tops. Wait for me. What is it? I'm scared. This is what real life is, Mithat. We'll fix it. Wait for me. Hurry. Where's her dad? Don't, Aykut. I know you're bored, honey, but we're almost there. I'm not bored, baby. I'm just wondering why we're going to Bolu for the surprise. What? Bolu? We've been on the road for three hours. There's no way we're still in Istanbul. Baby, just bear with me, please. I love it when you call me "baby." Come here, you. What happened to you? That's the seat. Enough. I'm taking it off. No! You're going to be so surprised. Do you want to play a game I used to play? No. Where are we? Surprise! This is where you grew up, right? It is indeed a surprise. Aykut, are you okay? No, yeah. I'm just taken aback. This is so nice of you. Come on. It looks the same. Even the color. We used to stay on this floor. Wow. You should've seen all the trouble we got in. -We had gangs, squads… -Did you have a nickname? -Aykut the Sharp. -Sharp? Everyone trembled when they heard my name. Wow. It's Mr. Cevdet. Those were the days. I can't believe it's been 26 years. He tortured us, the cranky old guy. -Who are you calling cranky? -Wow! Sir? Give me your hand. Here. Who are you? Aykut, sir. Aykut Aslan. -Aykut Aslan… -Class of 2002. -Aykut the Slow! -The Sharp, sir. My fiancée, sir. Please don't. I see. -Welcome, honey. -Thanks, sir. Come on. Let's have some tea. Now's not a good time, sir. Oh, come on. Aykut the Slow doesn't visit me every day, you know. Come in. Come on, honey. He's old. Don't antagonize him. Sure thing, Aykut the Slow. Oh, come on. Your wife, huh? Fiancée, sir. That's still something. I wouldn't expect it from him. -What do you mean? -He was a bit asocial, you know. He used to disappear on visiting days. -Right? -You know, rebellious. -What? -I didn't like such things. I did manage to find him once. -Oh? -Where do you think? -Where? -Where? -Where? -Where? -Where? -In the kitchen. He was hiding in a sack. No. That wasn't me. -There was this kid, Suat. -Yeah? He was little. There it is. Aykut! Is this you? I didn't know you took a photo. I have other photos too. You shouldn't bother, sir. It's no bother, son. What a nice photo. Can I keep it? Sure, honey. I have plenty. I'm sure you do. There. Look. The winter of '99. What a cold winter it was. Constant blizzards. True. Which one is you, Aykut? This one? -To the left. -This one? -More to the left. -This? Or this? -No. Even more. -There's no more kids. I think he… He must've folded it. See? There I am. No one wanted to be near me. But then, he somehow got so much better. Started to mingle with the others. Look. This is him putting on a puppet show for his friends. -You have a photo? -Sure I do. A puppet show? You know, the puppet… It was my tough side. The gang-member side. Sir, we should leave if you don't have any more photos. Of course. You mentioned you had no one at dinner, so I thought maybe you'd be happy if we invited a few of your friends. I'm sorry if I was mistaken. Of course not, honey. It was so nice of you, but I don't have much to tell about here. You saw. I didn't even have a gang. You do have a gang. Aren't we a gang? Sure we are. We don't need anyone. That's right. You're so full of surprises, though. Puppets and stuff. You know I don't like to talk about these things. -But it was a big hit. -Yeah? Sure. Kids from other classes used to come and watch. The teachers used to keep chanting, "Encore! Encore, Aykut!" Aykut, I can't even imagine getting married to anyone but you. Me too. -Where do you think Mithat is? -What? Let's go home and see him. -Why? -He must've missed me. I've been gone all day. He's young, you know. We shouldn't neglect him. -Good evening. -Good evening. Good evening. -I'll go see him. -Sure. -Where have you-- -Stop. We need to find Talat. -Hi, Dad. -Hi, honey. Why do you need him? Why do you care? Just tell me if you can help me find him. I mean… He could be at his mom's! -Can you find it? -I know the place. This is the first moment I'm proud of being your brother-in-law. No offense. What should we tell them? Calm down. I'll handle them. You're a man now. -Aykut's taking me to a nightclub! -What the hell? Are you insane? I swear he's crazy. He keeps cracking jokes. We're just going to… -We have a soccer game. -This late? Yeah, it's at 10:00 p.m. They asked me to bring a strong forward. -So I thought… -Aykut! What size are you? There's no need, Mithat. He's so excited. You've been ringing for 15 minutes. They're not home. What choice do I have, Mithat? Hey! It's Talat. -Answer it. -What? Stay calm and answer the phone. Calmly find out where he is. Come on. You got this. -Yes, Talat? -Find out where he is. Dude, ask him where he is. Ask him! Ask him where he is, man! -Ask him! -I'm handling it. I can't send you money. Dilşah would kick my ass. Come on, dude. Find out where he is. Come on. You should've thought of that before abandoning me. I'm not that naive kid anymore. What did you do? I said, "I'm not that naive kid anymore," and hung up. Who do you think we're looking for? I told you to ask. This is not how a team operates. Calm down. He asked for money, so he must be at the casino. -Which casino? -I know the place. -Are you sure? -I am, Aykut. It's illegal, though. This is just like Semih's goal against Croatia. -Yeah? -Let's go find him. -Follow me, brother. -You're the best. There! There it is. I remember it now. Come on, Aykut. See? How is this a casino? Are you kidding me? See? What did I tell you? I'm so proud of you tonight that I'm exhausted. -You're no longer the kid I met. -Really? How did you grow so much? Did you take a course? Take this. This is a dangerous place, man. I'll go in alone. You go home. Stop, Aykut. I should be with you. I know this place well. Look, Mithat. So many of our youth were lost to this menace. Gambling will end your life, Mithat. They'll tell you once wouldn't hurt, then they get you addicted. Look, Aykut. I didn't go to college. I always live in shame. You will study, son. Go on now. -I already study, Aykut. -The fuck you do. It's a shitty college. You don't have a scholarship. I know what it is. Just go home, man. Don't tell anyone. -Come on. -All right. Aykut, listen! What the hell is it, Mithat? They'll ask you the password. "Bracelets are on. The rest is coming." Piss off. Stop messing around. I regret praising you. You started the jokes right away. I'm going in like a thief, man. What am I even doing? The drapes are clingy. I can't get out. Harun barely stops the ball. It was a nice shot, but Harun pulled off an amazing save. It's going to be a corner kick. There's going to be a substitution. I won't step on the couch, ma'am. Don't worry. It's impossible to sleep nowadays. It's so hot. I won't stay long. -"The bracelet…" -What? "The bracelet…" What was it? -"The bracelet"? -Does that ring a bell? "The bracelets…" "…are on." Excellent. "The bracelets are on." I see. And the rest? Don't even ask about the rest, sir. He did try to tell me, but I dismissed him and sent him home. Who are you looking for? I'm looking for Mr. Talat, sir. It's not like me to just come in through the window, normally. I'd never… I see. BE QUIET MIND YOUR STEP I'm petrified. I'm petrified, sir. You could just run a normal illegal casino and pay your fines. What is this? Is the kid an actress too? Is the lady from a casting agency? This is wrong. -Is this the door? -What's with the jersey? Never mind that. We have bigger problems. Don't you realize that? Are you one of the Forty Thieves, sir? Whose idea was this? You people are unbelievable. Close it behind me. I don't want the kid to become a gambler. And he scores! It's five. -Here we go. -Look at them. Such a shame. You really need to be addicted to even come here. -Continuing. -Yes. It's one. To hell with one. How does this keep happening? I'm dealing. Anyone? Here we go. Bets? You in the hole? For now. You know… Oh, wow! Brother, welcome. Stop with the act. I want my ID. I don't want the visa. I'll take care of it. Have a drink. Stop with the kisses! I have no more love for you. Where's my ID? They say you marry people without them knowing. Who says that? It's gossip. Piss off. Who cares who? Where's my ID, then? Hand it over. -I gave it to someone else. -Was it Tufan? Did he marry me, Talat? -God damn you to hell! -Calm down, sir. It's his first time. He's excited. Calm down, man. What kind of a man are you? Gülşah was right. I am naive. -Final bets. -Was it because of this? This worthless piece of plastic? Huh? -I swear this is my lucky day. -We're done. Get up. We're leaving. You're right. Fine. -Get up. -Okay. Eleven. -What? -Eleven. My fortune is back. Fifty-thousand dollars. This was good. Very good. Come see, brother. I am not your brother! Stop giving him chips, man. Why did you bet so much? You've lost all sense of shame, man. You don't have any shame at all. You have a family, man. -A daughter. -Thirty-five grand. What did you say? Thirty-five thousand dollars. -We won? -Amazing. We'll deduct that from your debt, Mr. Talat. What? Am I that much in debt? I had no idea. I'm surprised. There's nothing to do, I guess. Next time. "Next time"? Ask around. Maybe someone has an extra ID. Why did you park so close to the wall? I'm not one to run away. Keep it quiet. People are sleeping. Fine. I promise, man. I swear I'm going to fix this. You don't need to calm me down. You'll tell them everything tomorrow morning. You don't get it. I can't. I won't be able to see my daughter. I did it for Sude. She needs her father, you jackass. She doesn't need your money. Are you trying to ruin the family? "Gülşah and Aykut won't marry." "Sadi won't get the inheritance. He'll go under." Is that your goal? What inheritance? The inheritance they'll get when we're married. -You two are getting married? -In a month. You did say you were Gülşah's boyfriend, though. Dude, she can be my girlfriend and fiancée. You said "a fortunate path." Isn't marriage a fortunate path? You should've just told me. How would I know? I'm so sorry I confused you. I was about to close the land deal. Dilşah's going to kill me. I don't know about that, but you're going to tell them tomorrow. -I can't. -Oh, but you will, Mr. Talat. You will tell them. I won't move an inch until morning. I'll be watching you closely. I'll stand guard like a commando. You'll see. I won't even blink till morning. I swear I won't! You think I'm naive. You think I'm a sucker. You think you fooled me, right? We'll see! Talat's gone. He's gone. "I'm not one to escape," he says. You're running off? What? No. I'm taking out the trash. You get people in trouble and then just bolt. Isn't that nice? -We're leaving. -What's wrong, Talat? Who's the gentleman? Nothing's wrong, Mom. We were just talking. What did you do? Son, whatever the issue is, I can take care of it. Mr. Talat's right, ma'am. I'm his brother-in-law. Yeah, exactly. He's my brother-in-law. Look at him. Did you patch things up with Dilşah? Yeah. I'm trying to, Mom. He's just helping me out. It's all fine. -I'm here to pick up his luggage. -Oh, yeah? That's nice. I'll take it to the car and leave you two alone. What issue could I possibly have with my brother-in-law, Mom? Don't you burden that big heart of yours. Go ahead and close the door. I'll be off now. See you. Go ahead, Mom. Goodbye. Let's go. You have such a nice car, brother. Stop sucking up. You told me you could fix this. -Can you? -I swear I can. -How long will it take? -Two days at most, brother. I'll destroy you if you're lying. You're hurting my feelings. Where's my ID? Cevat has it. Kamber Cevat. He'll take care of it. #COMEONBOCURGAT GO BE SUCCESSFUL We're here, Talat. Tell me. I gave your ID to a guy called Cevat. He should know where she is. He "should" know? -Quiet, brother. -Don't call me brother! I lost my faith in brotherhood because of you. That's fine, but calm down. This is a dangerous neighborhood. The streets are the common sense of our country. Don't discriminate. -Hi, brother scavenger. -Fuck off. Hi, mussel guy. Stop greeting people and drive, honey. Let's ask someone. Pull up right here. All right. Hey, kid. Look. Do you happen to know a Kamber Cevat? Why would I tell you, moron? -Keep going. -Sure, honey. -Let's keep going. -Why, man? -Hang on, kid. -What are you doing? Don't get out. What are you doing? Hello, little guy. What did he do? Did you see what it was? The bastard stabbed me. My leg! I can't feel my leg, Talat. What happened to us, man? What happened to the flowery neighborhoods? We used to draw circles with compasses, man. Who taught these kids to stab people with them? -I thought these were your streets. -The streets have changed, Talat. Call an ambulance. I told you not to get out. You didn't listen. Talat, help me. Save me. That compass really hurt me. He stabbed me good. I just said hi to the bastard. These prayer beads are cool. Are they jet? Yeah, they are. Why didn't you tell us he's your dad instead of stabbing me, Chucky? "Chucky"? You were a pedagogue a second ago. Shut up, man. -This is our place. -All right. You stay. I'll talk. Don't forget your backpack, son. Go on. Give me those beads. You're too young for them. No offense, but I have to tell your father. Assalamu alaikum. Alaikumu assalam, brother. What's up, Şevko? You go inside, son. I'm glad you sent him inside. I'm actually here for something else, but it's fine. Children's mental health is important to me. Ibn Khaldun once said, "Teach yourself manners before you teach your kids." -Piss off. -This is what he was talking about. He stabbed you, honey. I know. They're not open to conversation. Hop in. Sorry to bother you, man. See you. It's like a family tradition. He stabbed the same spot. An inch deeper, and it would've hit the artery. He shouldn't move. Thanks. Don't worry, brother. You're fine. She said they'll patch you up. This is wrong, man. I called the family. We're going to tell them everything. I'm not a saint or a hero. I can't save everyone. -Brother, please. -No, man. -You don't get it. -Here they are. -Hi, Mithat. -Brother! -God spared you, man. -Aykut! -I'm okay. -What the hell? -What happened? -I'm fine. I have more important things to tell you. -I made a mistake. -Of course you did, honey. You made the biggest mistake imaginable. You should've let them stab me instead. Gülşah, where did you find this absolute gem of a man? It's impossible to find such good men anymore. -You're fine, right? -I am. Dilşah, if it weren't for Aykut, your husband would be dead now. You're already dead to me. -Is that so? Dad-- -Don't call me that. -Mom, listen to me very carefully. -Hang on. You're exhausted. You lost a lot of blood. You know the place, Sadi. They pulled us over on the way to Beykoz. They said it was a routine inspection. They told us to get out. They started searching the car. What do you think they found in Aykut's car? -Drugs. -It's a lie! -No! That's a lie. -Of course it was a lie, honey. You lost a lot of blood. Stop moving. Turns out they're a gang. They were fishing for a bribe. You know how naive I am. I was about to give them money. Moron. But him? Not naive at all. He's smart. He told me not to. He took a look at them and immediately got suspicious. -Aykut? -Yeah? Then he checked what they "found" in the car. He smelled it. What do you know? It was mint! "This is mint," he said, "Who do you think you're fooling?" I swear I was so impressed. -Is he telling the truth? -What do you mean? Of course I am. I know you don't like talking about this stuff. -I'll tell them. -Don't mention it, man. "Let me see your badges," he said. He yelled, even. See? I'm getting shivers just telling you the story. They figured out he's onto them, so they started babbling. They babbled and babbled. -Then they pulled out compasses! -Knives. Right. Knives. Aykut? Hang on, honey. Let him finish. Go on. Anyway, long story short, they were all over me by the car. Just as they were about to stab me, Aykut rushed to my rescue. He put himself between us. So they just stabbed him and ran away. That's when I realized how important relatives were. We should all support each other. We shouldn't sell each other out. Right? You can't exactly choose your relatives, but the concept is beautiful. You're unbelievable, Aykut. You're so brave. You know I don't like talking about these things, Sadi. All right. You're already exhausted anyway. Yeah, but I do need to tell you. I see swindlers every day, man. It was foolish of them to think they could deceive me. -You're the best. -"Show your badges," I said. -Right? -Right. Right. They were just shocked. I asked which precinct they were from. No answer. Wouldn't you know if you were a policeman, honey? You would. -What's your name? -Mithat. See? He didn't even think about it. Yeah. So I got on their nerves. Then I saw they were all over Talat. Hold this, Mithat. -Three guys, right? -Maybe even five. I just jumped them. I shielded him. -I wish you hadn't. -Sadi. Then I got stabbed. I was like, "Oh, no." -So unfortunate. -Talat kept pulling on my shirt. "Stop. I'll get them," I said. He was like, "Please don't go." I said, "Why? It's safe here. Come on." He kept pleading. "Don't go, please!" -Coward. -It was unbelievable. He was so panicked, devastated. I felt sorry for him. He was thrashing around. "Don't leave me, Aykut!" He had a snot bubble too. It was like his first day at school. He cried like a kid. Oh, right. Then a kid from Oltu-- Look. There's no point in talking about this any further. Thank God we're safe now. We're with our warm, cozy family. Thank God indeed. Just get well soon, Aykut. Oh, wow. It's late. We should get going. Aykut, you've been through so much, honey. Don't go. Stay for the night. Right, Sadi? She's right, son. You can't drive like this. -I don't even have my clothes. -I'll lend you some. -Thanks, but-- -They're right. You stay. I'll go. God forbid if they want to seek revenge. I should be the victim this time. I hope so. Look, honey. I'll come all the way here just to bring you to school tomorrow. Fine. Stay. You'll leave in the morning. I don't want him to get in trouble. Oh, yeah? Are you worried about me? Still, I should go. Off you go, then. Good night. I mean… Stay, I guess. We have a free room upstairs. You two should stay. Let's… Let's just do that. How nice. We can share the room. -The two of us? -I guess. I see my hero is still up. Don't call me that. I mean, I try. Why were you talking to Talat? Don't forget what I told you. It's just that… He thanked me for today. He asked for advice. Is there something you want to tell me? Like what? I don't know. You tell me. -I don't know. -You went pale. I'm nervous since it's the first time we're staying in the same house. Okay. Remember how I implied you were naive the other day? I think I was being unfair. I told you, Ms. Gülşah. You didn't believe me. Who's naive now? -Your father will see. -Honey… I don't care, Aykut. I'm just nervous. What happened today… If what Talat told us is true-- To the letter. It's all true. Yeah. I was so scared. -Were you worried about me? -Of course I was. -For my safety? -The man I love got stabbed. Say that again. The man… You know. Look, Ms. Gülşah. Your love gives strength to that man. No knife can scare him. Oh, honey… What are you doing? -All right. Fine. -It still hurts. My golden mimosa. You look beautiful even before bed. -Give me your IBAN. -What? Give me your IBAN. I'll deposit the money you saved. What are you talking about? You don't get it, do you? The issue isn't money. It never has been. Your daughter needs her father, and I need the man I love. I'm sure you can't grasp the concept. I could just deposit the money, you know. So, since we're an even stronger couple now-- I love the way you talk. Go on. I think we need to make certain sacrifices for our family. I'd die for this family. You know how Dad is in financial trouble. I do. We'll get through it. We'll get through it together. We'll lose the mansion if we don't get married in a week. -What? -Yeah. If we get married right away, we can get the inheritance and help Dad. That's a wonderful idea. What an idea. I mean… That is a good idea. But we were set on getting married in a month. -And the invitations-- -Oh, no. We don't need a ceremony. Right. Yeah. -That'd be wonderful. -Right? We should help your dad. We should. We need to relieve him of the stress. -For real? -Of course. -I knew you wouldn't say no. -You did? I did. I love you so much. Please, honey. Someone will see. I'm just nervous. -Fine. Go to sleep. Don't worry about it. -All right. -We'll figure out the details later. -Okay. -See you. -Bye. -Love you. -I love you too. Motherfucker… -Brother? -Greetings, Mr. Talat. -Hello. -Hi. I'm upstairs. I have good news. Yeah. -We're getting married. -What? -This week. -Why? -Why do you think? -Why? Come. I'll tell you. Hurry up. Just come here. Thank you, Aykut. You're welcome, Sude. Good luck today. Here we go. Come here, honey. Take my hand. Don't go anywhere. I'll be back in a minute. You know what? Let's go to the park this weekend. -We'll get ice cream too. -For God's sake… You know what? We should fly kites too. That's a good idea. -It'll be fun. -Sit down. -What? -Sit. Look. I'm tired of doing stupid things so they wouldn't kick you out. -And that was a stupid gift. -Sude-- -Don't interrupt me. -Sorry, honey. Look at her. So innocent. Point to my backpack. As if you care about her lunch. Did you do something to Aykut? He looks so preoccupied. I swear I didn't. I hope so, Dad. If you ever break our hearts again, I'll destroy you. She has no idea. -Get up. -What? -Get up. -All right. He doesn't deserve your love. Hug me properly. Poor thing. Now go. God help you, Talat. I wish you didn't have to get married in a week. Take pity on that innocent girl if nothing else, man. You really have no shame. Do you know this Süleyman? No, honey. I don't mingle with con men. I have good news, though. -You know the guy who stabbed you? -God damn him. God damn him to hell. He supposedly brings the IDs here, and Süleyman marries people off. "Supposedly"? You keep sending me on wild goose chases, man. -Be clear for once. -I'm doing whatever I can. Do more, Talat. Do more. The family trusts me, you know. I'll destroy you if they lose the mansion. What are you doing, man? What is this? You're so stressed. Stop thinking about bad things. Just be optimistic. -Who are you? -Aykut. You sound like a coward. You're Aykut Aslan, man! We'll go in, get her address, and get you a divorce. Done. It's fixed. It's over. All right? Come on. Don't be like this. -I'm just nervous. -You don't need to be. Please. -Come on. -All right. I'll get divorced. It's a done deal. It's over. Come on. Hello, son. Hi, ma'am. I'm sorry. I see you have guests. -We're looking for Mr. Süleyman. -He's gone, son. When will he be back? He'll never be back. SÜLEYMAN ATABAY 1960-2020 -Is that him? -He's gone, son. -Is that Süleyman? -I never saw him. -He's gone for good? -Yes, son. Oh, Süleyman… Oh, son. Please don't cry. -Come here, son. -Oh, ma'am… Oh, Süleyman… Süleyman… Stop beating yourself up over it, honey. He's not coming back. I'm not crying because he's dead. Where's my ID? Did you know Süleyman? Of course we did, man. What are you doing? Let's just observe them. Maybe they'll say something. We were his close friends. So close, man! Let me, ma'am. Let me fulfill my duties as his friend. Please let me do it, ma'am. We were inseparable. We were like two peas in a pod. He left us so soon. Tell me about it, man. If we were to come here yesterday… But what can we do? An untimely death. It's tough. He had been sick for four years. He didn't look sick, though. He didn't let us see that. He was up and running till the last day. -Am I right? Wasn't he? -Of course he was. We saw him just last week. I saw him on the street and asked where he was going. "Home," he said. Can you take the tray, ma'am? I said I'd drop him off, but he wanted to walk. -Dude. -Yeah? My dad didn't have legs. How did he lead the organization from his bed? He must've been a good leader. Look, guys. I've never seen you with him. -Are you his contacts abroad? -Yes! I was abroad, and he was here. That's how we did it. We did so much business together. Last week, just for old times' sake, we married this poor sap, Aykut. He told me something last time we talked. Maybe he knew. He said, "We hurt so many people, son." "Set that guy free." It's like he knew. He said, "If something happens to me, go to my funeral." "People might be pissed, but don't you back down." "Ask them about his ID." -"Find it." -We don't know. Dad didn't use to tell us everything. -Never mentioned you. -Never. He didn't? I mean… What's your deal, guys? Why did you come to his funeral like you knew him? What are you after? I have nothing to do with it. I'm just here to support him. That's all. Please, people. I know you have a funeral. I really don't want to say it, but I'm sick and tired of this. I really am. This idiot sold you guys my ID for peanuts. I can't even report it. I can't talk to anyone. It's all because of him. I ask him where my ID is. He says, "Maybe there." We go and find nothing. I ask him who has my ID. He says, "Maybe him." We go and find nothing at all. I'm walking around with an invitation like a postman. -Aykut-- -Shut up! You drove me insane! I don't want to speak ill of the deceased, but he wasn't a good guy. -What? -You think I like this? I'm crying at the guy's funeral as if I knew him. I'll go wash up. I'm in big trouble here. Fuck Süleyman anyway. -Come here. -Calm down. Get over here! Stop running! I'll give you your ID! Guys, this is really unnecessary. Please. Run! MYHOME PHONE SHOP Aykut, we're all ready for the big dance. Yay! What am I going to tell them? I'm so embarrassed. We'll get new invitations, man. Please stop talking. Just look for her. We don't have time. What do you think I'm doing? I'm trying to find her. E-GOVERNMENT PORTAL Don't get me wrong, but I have a question, Aykut. Why did her grandma leave all the inheritance to Gülşah? Did they ever mention it at the mansion? What do you think? Give me some credit. I'm just watching it as a hobby. -Yes! -Oh, no. Another goal? What? I found my wife, man. Thank God. I'm married to Selbi Hamidova, apparently. How are we supposed to find her? Give Talat a name, and watch him handle it. Hang on. Hi, Tufan. You have connections, right? Can you help me find someone? He's not some guy. It's my brother-in-law again. Yeah? I'm not sure Tufan even exists. The guy seems to know everything. -Kiwi tea, boss? -Watch the shop. -Is this the address? Are you sure? -Absolutely. What are we waiting for, then? Let's go. You just keep looking at the place. I was waiting for you. -Oh, come on, man. -For God's sake. You were the one waiting. Can I help you? We're looking for Selbi, sir. I think we're in the wrong place. No, you aren't. Selbi is our assistant. She just went to the pharmacy. Who are you, then? This is Selbi's husband. Is that so? Welcome, son. -Thank you, sir. -Come on in. You can wait inside. -We should-- -Come on. It's your wife's place. -She'll be back any minute now. -Come on, honey. -Hello, sir. -Welcome. -Is this your wife? -Yes. My beloved. She gave my life meaning. She passed three years ago. -Our condolences. -Thank you. Everything went wrong after that. My heart, my lungs… Everything went south. I basically died with her. Such love. This is real love, though. I wish I could go down that path, sir. He's still talking about paths. Get it together, man. Pass that over. Pass what over, sir? This thing? Here you go, sir. Are you okay? Strange. I don't feel the oxygen. Selbi knows how to adjust this. Give it to her husband. He'll take a look. -Maybe Selbi told him. -Will you? I'm not familiar with the equipment, but… -It seems to be working. -I'd know if it was working. You try it. You know Selbi too. -Go ahead. -Put the cylinder over here. Nothing. -He'd know anyway. -Of course. -Hurry up. -Take it. I'll turn it up a bit. Turn it up. It's stronger now that you turned it up. -Exactly. -It's better now, sir. Try it. But I'm sure there's a dosage. We don't want him-- I doubt it. I'm turning it up a bit more. Good? I'm cranking it up. Now I feel it. See, his color is back. I definitely feel it now. Much better. Can I check? Please. -Go ahead. -All right. -It's good. -I don't want to make a mistake. Oh, wow. This is it. -Right? -Yes. This is the real deal. Oh, wow. Excellent. I feel alive for once. -Right? -You have to try it, Aykut. -How is it? -You cranked it up. It's strong. Inhale it. -He feels it. -I was nervous, but… -It's working. -We were too, but see? -It's amazing. -It's good. -Yeah. -It's working. I have a surprise for you, sir. Let's mix it up a bit. Go ahead. Oh God… -Beautiful. -Sir… Sir, stop hogging it. We're waiting here. -It's good. Go ahead. -Let's see. It's really something else. I want to devour it. We need to get a few of these, man. Yeah. -Come on. -You can always use it. Let us. It's good, right? -Inhale! -I'm inhaling. Hang on. Keep going. -Whose turn was it? -Watch me. I'm playing with the dial. There we go! Let's have some soup afterwards. Love you, man! Look at me. Wow. You can't even look. -What is this stuff? -Right? I introduced them, you know. I'm so glad I did. When will she be here? He misses his wife. Dude… Where were you, Selbi? I brought his pills from the pharmacy. How many times have I told you not to leave Dad alone at home? I'm really sorry, Mrs. Sevgi. Get the door. I hear people yelling in there. -Slow down! -Don't be scared. -Keep going. -I'm in control. -Don't worry. -Let's go. Here we go. -He's like a machine gun! -He is? Shoot the enemy, then. Here we go! -Turn. -Come on. He's a tough son of a bitch. He went all the way through. Which one of you is Selbi? I brought her her husband. She's the younger one with blue eyes. You're a lucky man. What do you guys want from me? You ruined my life. I don't have a job or a place to live now. Lady, we're still a bit hazy. -Calm down. -Why would I calm down? This guy wants to divorce me. They'll kick me out of the country if we get divorced. Look, Ms. Selbi. I'll be in so much trouble if we don't get divorced. -See, the inheritance-- -Honey, this is not the right time. You want a divorce? Yes, ma'am. If you'll allow me, that is. I really want it. -Fine. Let's get divorced. -Nice. I have one condition, though. You have to pay for my losses. We're ready to do whatever it takes. Believe me. It's not just that you're my wife, but we're allies too. Help me out, and I'll surely repay you. -A hundred grand. -What? -Come on! -I paid 70,000 liras for the marriage. I added 30,000 for my unjust suffering. So it's 100,000 liras total. Now that she's explained it, the price is reasonable. I'm sure it's reasonable to you. You're not the one paying it. Ms. Selbi, how are you suffering? Please. Where am I going to live? Have you thought about that? -What did she say? -She's asking where she'll live. Don't you have any relatives here? Any acquaintances? I don't have anyone. -Anyone? -Anyone. When did you come to Turkey? -I got it. You can stay with Aykut. -Wow! What a wonderful idea. How did I not think of that? I'm not the immigration office! No way! -I won't live with a stranger. -She's right. I won't either. Ms. Selbi, this man is your lawfully-wedded husband. You can stay with him. He won't kick you out. If he's a real man, that is. Don't be ridiculous, man. Don't get me wrong, ma'am. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but there's no way you can stay with me. I'm sorry. -Are we there yet? We're exhausted. -Quiet, man. This is an upright neighborhood. Ms. Selbi, you're going to have to leave if I have any guests. How nice of you. Suit yourself. These are my rules. I won't apologize for them. Just keep it quiet. Brother! God damn your brother! God damn him, seriously. Surprise. What's your favorite fruit? Mine's plum. So you're Azeri-Turkish, huh? I'm Azerbaijani-Turkish. I see. I underestimated your bachelor pad, man. The view is amazing. You're a lucky man. How are you so relaxed? You got us into so much trouble, yet you're having cacık. What the hell, man? You asked me to find her, so I did. What do you want from me? Aykut, do you have any peaches? Go check the fridge. So it's all fixed now? How am I supposed to find 100,000 liras? Just figure it out. You'll deduct it from the inheritance. -Aykut? -So you want the inheritance now? That money belongs to the family. -Aykut? -It's not my money, man. I was thinking of you. -Do you have any plums? -Mithat! To hell with plums, man. Go check the fridge, dude! -He usually likes plums. -I don't like to be touched. I'll check the fridge real quick. For God's sake… I got it. Let's sell your car. Let's just sell it. Tax cuts are coming. I know dealers. You're a horrible man. Did you meet Dilşah at the police station, man? You got me married. Now you want me to sell my car. What's next? My kidneys? I'm just trying to find a solution. If I were able to sell my land, we wouldn't be talking about this. She wants money, man. Look at her. She's like an Azerbaijani lioness. She just wants 100,000 liras. You'll finally marry Gülşah. What's it going to be? Gülşah or your car? Make up your mind. You're a dangerous man! You're poison! You sucked me up like a vortex. You hogtied me. You're ridiculous. Go talk to her, then. Tell her to divorce you for free. For God's sake. I won't go below 150. I won't let it go below that anyway. Are you crazy? I'm calling him. Hi, Tufan. Do you happen to know any car dealers? We need to sell my brother-in-law's car. "Mint condition. From a very popular tradesman." No. No paint jobs. It's like brand-new. There's a dent in the bumper. No bodywork. No bodywork at all. I have a question. Do you know any Azerbaijani fruit? It looks delicious. Hey! Aykut's up! Selbi made these amazing qutabs, brother. You'll lose your mind. -Take a seat. -What? Qutab? Can you please realize the situation? -What are you doing? -Phone call. Hang up. I'll call you later. -Did you not listen to me? -What's wrong? -Why are you panicking? -Go sell the car. Consider it done, man. I'll take care of it. -Be at the courthouse in 30. -Okay. -Thirty minutes! -Sure. Go get ready, you two. This is not a food and travel show. -Is this qutab? -Yeah. We call that gözleme here. Taste first, talk later. -Tastes like bazlama. -Qutab. It's gözleme, man. You're still here? Come on, man! -It's your sister! -What? -Go hide! -Are you serious? You ruined my life! I swear I'll burn this place to the ground if Gülşah sees you. -Come on! -Let's go. Honey? What's up? Hi, baby. Sorry I dropped by unexpectedly. No problem. I just wasn't decent. Is this a bad time? Of course not, honey. -Welcome. -It's so hot. Let's go out to the balcony, then. I need some water. I'll bring you some. -Hang on. -I can get it. You want to get it yourself? From the kitchen? Come on, then. Go ahead. -When does your shift start? -I have some time. The balcony! Come on! Go! I'm coming. How's business? No fires nowadays? No fires, but we're still very busy. Enjoy your water. Thank God we have water. May God leave no one without water. -Did you have guests? -No. Why? The table. -I had guests. -Yeah? Fevzi and Chubby. I served them breakfast before work. You know, the kid works a lot. I felt sorry, so I arranged a breakfast. -Now what? -Get lost! Then I told him to get lost. I told him to get to work already. He left just before you came. -I have an idea. -I'm going up! Can we handle the application on Wednesday? Let's make it Tuesday! The sooner I get married to you the happier I'll be. Tuesday, you say? I need your ID now, then. Wednesday's better. I just gave my ID to Chubby. He was just here, you know. He kept asking for it. He needed it for the gas bill. Am I pushing you, Aykut? Did I make you feel that way? -Do you feel under pressure? -Of course not. Do I look under pressure? -You do. -Hang on. Please stop the moron. -Oh, come on! -He's going up. What the hell? -I'm back. -If you feel nervous-- No. I'm not nervous at all. I just closed the door. -Are you sure? -It was noisy. -You're acting-- -No, honey. Everything's fine. Look how happy I am. Come on. It's so nice of you to do this for me and my family. Be careful. I'd die for you and your family, but I hope no one dies. We're getting married this week! -Yeah! I hope so, honey. -Oh, honey. Aykut? What's wrong? -I just got emotional. -Why? It's the kid in me. He waited for this for years. -It's not easy. -I'm nervous too, honey. Please calm down. It's going to be fine. -Is she dead? -I don't know. She's so young. -What are you doing? -Isn't it obvious? I'm just so excited. Calm down, honey. Why? We're only going to experience this once. -You don't fall from a building every day. -What? -What? -What did you say? -Nothing. -Help her! -What's with the-- -It's just a crowded neighborhood. Let's just go. -But they look panicked. -Wool is on sale. They're like vultures. My arms are tired! -I'm exhausted! -It's summer. No wonder wool's on sale. -I'm walking. No need to rush. -You're going to be late. I don't want you to get in trouble at work. I won't. -Aykut. -Yeah, honey? -I'm glad I have you. -You're late. -I mean it. -Come on, honey. Come on! -Off you go. -Okay. We'll build a life together. There. Off you go. Oh, you! Selbi! -It's 120/80. -It is? You'll be fine. Selbi… I'm so sorry. I never thought that'd happen. What kind of people are you? Just kill me and get it over with. We can't go back in time. I hope we'll all recover soon. You'll recover all right. I'm the one who's injured. I want 15,000 more for my arm. What? 15,000? Come on! It's cheap if anything. Ms. Selbi, look. We won't be able to pay if you do this. If it were my other arm, I'd probably lower the price, but it's my favorite arm. -She's right. -Is she now? You threw her off a building. Of course she is. This is my arm, man. What's 15,000 liras anyway? My beautiful arm. Where are you? Just get over here. Hi, man. Don't worry. It's done. They wouldn't pay more than 100,000, though. You go to the courthouse. I have to stop by somewhere. I'll be right there. Don't worry. I have the money. You'll be a new man by the end of the day. Talk to you later. -Good afternoon. -You too. Welcome. Honey, I can't tell you how excited I got when you called. I was shaking. I'm still trembling a bit. -What are those? -Golden mimosas. For you. Shut up. I need to tell you something. -Just a second. Excuse me? -How can I help you? Can you put these in water? They look pale in comparison. -I'm listening, honey. -Dad's having a hard time financially. I'm sure. The economy is bad. You know how Dad pays Sude's tuition. -But, honey-- -Listen to me first. Remember how you offered me my own money? I need it now. I'll text you my IBAN so you can wire it. Here's the money. Our daughter's going to get an education. She already goes to school. Yeah? I wonder what grade she is in. Since we solved our issues… I'm not busy. What do you want to do? What do you say? Do you want me to follow you? You look so noble walking away. BROTHER-IN-LAW Damn it. Look who's here. -Where have you been? -I'm here now. Look. I brought you a 1994 Mercedes so you won't be on foot. -What's wrong with her? -Ms. Selbi fell off the roof. All's well that ends well. Just pay her so we can end this. Oh, you reminded me of something. I have good news and bad news. I took care of Sude's tuition, man. I'm patching things up with Dilşah too. We're flirting, even. It's going well. Is this why we're here? I'm sharing my excitement with you, man. Don't be such a killjoy. Fine. I'm glad. -Education is important. -Yeah. -Was Sude happy? -Of course she was, man. Poor thing. -Where did you get the money? -Well, I sold the car. -The car? -The car, man. -The blue one? -Yes, the blue one. The tuition is paid. I'll pay you back. Don't worry. -Are you kidding me? -You're glad, right? Did I sell my livelihood so you can show off, you bastard? -"Bastard"? -I'll kill you! Get me a stick. I'll kill you! This is her education, man! Stop! You'd get it if you had kids. You're dead. They're just playing around. -You know how poor I am. -Stop. Come here. Unlock the door. Come on. Get me a stick or a rock! -Come on! -Don't, Mithat! -I won't hurt you. -Look at your eyes. I promise! Get out. Dilşah needed my help for our kid. I had to. With my money? We'll figure it out. Don't get mad. You're going to find that money. Find it today. -How? -Just get me a rock, dude. I promise I'll get it. Oh, I got it. Go get a loan. Just get one. I'll co-sign. No one does that nowadays, you know. I'm willing to do it. Just think about it for a minute. Unfortunately, as Mr. Talat as the co-signer, we can't provide you a loan. What? There must be a mistake. Can you see why on the computer? He's blacklisted by our bank. If that were true, I'd know. The note says, "He doesn't answer any calls." -I lost my phone in Greece-- -I don't want to know. MİTHAT So I can't get a loan because of him. -Unfortunately, Mr. Aykut. -I see. -Just talk to him. He keeps calling. -What is it, Mithat? I swear you guys made me hate every form of kinship, man. Quick question. If I hadn't brought Mr. Talat in here, if you hadn't seen him at all, would I have been able to get a loan? I'm sorry, Mr. Aykut. We can't help you. You don't have your ID anyway. -What did he say? -I'll tell you in the car. Come on. I don't even know where we're going. I'm drifting along. They ruined my life. They took my youth away. They destroyed me. I can't tell anyone about this. Anyone. So why am I telling a stranger? I have no idea. BEYKOZ POLICE STATION You can't park here, sir. TURKISH POLICE ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF TURKISH JUSTICE. -What happened? -Aykut! Thank God you're here. Stop it. What is it? Did you kill someone? Selbi's last employer lodged a complaint. They arrested us. -Where's she? -They're taking her statement. All right. We can't go back in time. You didn't tell anyone, right? -I called Dad. -Why do you keep doing this stuff? But you didn't answer. I was busy! Do you ever think about the things I have to do? Just stop with this nonsense, Mithat. I can't take it anymore. This is driving me insane, Mithat. All right. We can handle Sadi. We have to. He told Mom, though. Fine. -I'll talk to your mom. -Okay. We need to stay calm. She called Dilşah, though. Are you the A-Team or something? Why do you have to go everywhere together? Talat can handle Dilşah. All right. Let's stay calm. What's important is not to let Gülşah-- -She called her. -For fuck's sake! Fuck, man! You guys will be the end of me. You ruined my life. You and the jerk outside teamed up and tore me into pieces. -But… -He held me down, and you took a bite. Then you held me down, and he took a bite. You passed me around like I'm a football! -What if your sister dumps me, man? -Don't say-- You wouldn't survive the shock, let alone Gülşah. Have mercy on yourself if not me, man! If only you'd let me be. I'd do everything to help you. I'd do everything I could. I'm completely lost, man. You keep calling each other. What is this? -There. -Mithat? For God's sake, don't talk. -What happened? -Aykut, what is it? -He's completely fine. -You okay, Mithat? There was a fight somewhere. They thought he looked like one of the offenders. That's why they brought him in. It's all sorted. -Yeah. I just-- -"For God's sake," I said. "For God's sake," I said. -Unbelievable. -Everything's fine. I just panicked. How are you, Şule? Were you at work? Look who's here. Were you? -The gentleman is talking to you. -What gentleman? -The lieutenant's talking to you. -Who? Did you find your wife? Your wife, son. Did you find her? Weren't you here looking for your wife the other day, son? You asked the law enforcement to get involved. -You're confusing me with someone else. -Is this a joke? Of course not, sir, but you are. What's my name? Aykut. -Sir, the interrogation. -I'll be right there. Or was it Aydın? Aygün? Whatever. I'm too busy for this. It happens, sir. Don't worry about it. Aykut, I'm famished. Let's go eat. Who's the lady? What lady? That was the lieutenant. I have a confession to make. -Don't, brother. -This can't go on, Mithat. Just come with me. Just tell us the truth, son. -This is my family. -Oh, yeah? What's wrong, Aykut? What's going on? I can't keep this a secret anymore. -That woman-- -Talat tricked you, right? That's why you're here. Talat wouldn't do that, Dad. Come on, Dad. Aykut's not naive. Talat can't trick him. Well… Who's the woman, then? -Easy. -Sorry. Mithat's girlfriend. -What? -What? -Yeah. -Wow. He only shared the news with me. But please stay calm. Let's not embarrass him. He told me in confidence. You know how much he loves secrets. -Please, everyone. -I love her, Sadi. -You fall in love with everyone, Şule. -I love her. Calm down. -Let's-- -She's so pretty. -Yes. -How did she fall for his ugly mug? What ugly mug? Mithat's a handsome young man. Hello. -Act like we're a couple. -That's all I needed. -Hello. -This is my big sister Dilşah. Nice to meet you. -I'm so curious. -Please. He has a lot of girlfriends anyway. My other big sister Gülşah. -Hi. -Selbi. -Move. -She's Azerbaijani. Let me go! We're one big country with two flags! You and your love for ethnicity! I'm their mother. -Don't do it, Sadi. -No way, son. Son, why don't you introduce your friend? Of course, Mom. My girlfriend Selbi, my mom Şule. Sorry for meeting you like this. It's fine, Şule. Let's go. Come on. It's so nice to meet you, ma'am. Hello, honey. I'm Sadi. -I'm Mithat's father. -Nice to meet you. What happened? -He threw me off the roof-- -She means… "Roof" means "door" in Azerbaijani, right? That's what she means. Thanks. I'm okay now. She's okay. Get well soon. You know what? Let's host an Azerbaijani dinner tomorrow-- No, Şule. She can't. She's busy tomorrow. No, I'm not. I can come. Can you now? Şule's right. This is no way to meet, honey. -We should get to know each other better. -Yes, we should. Now that's my family! I love her, Dad. "I love her, Dad." What a lunatic. He overdoes everything. Anyway, I have to tell you something. Ms. Selbi, they rejected the loan. Don't ask why. -But-- -I don't want to know. How can we solve the money issue? You can't divorce now and pay later. -No such thing. -That's not what I meant. I'll honor my debt. I could find a co-signer if I had a few days. There'd even be a line of co-signers, but we don't have time. Can't we just divorce and-- Sign these bills. How do you know this stuff? Fine. I don't have a pen right now. Wow. -Sign here. -There's no discount at all. What can I do? And now I'm 200,000 liras in debt. Here. Are you satisfied? -Thank you. -I have a small request, then. Sure. What do you need? After we handle the divorce… You remember the dinner tonight? That's it! Yes! It's time we had some peace. Let's break the ice already. See? No effort goes unrewarded. Let's just get along already. I want 20,000 extra. I couldn't talk. My mouth was full. Isn't this the sign for peace and brotherhood? Since when does it mean money? You keep hitting us with new debt. Give him a discount. He's a victim too. -Turn the page. -She even has the discount ready. -Go ahead. -I'll sign. -Here. -Thanks. Let's go get divorced and have dinner afterwards. Then I don't want to see you again. I'm at the end of my rope. -Okay. Calm down. -I'm not that calm guy anymore. Do you have big breakfasts in Azerbaijan too? -Sure we do. -Yeah? -We do. -A minute, Talat. -I'm eating, honey. -Just come here. -I'll bring you tea on my way back. -Thanks. -Yeah. -Tea would be good. -What's up, man? -God damn you to hell. If you're done eating, let's go and get divorced. I'm not done yet. I'll meet you at the courthouse. I need to get ready. I need to look beautiful at the dinner tonight. What is she even talking about? -Ms. Selbi? -Yes? Sorry to bother you, but should I dress traditionally? Will we have a dance? Or is my outfit okay? Your call. Thank you so much. See? She's not that bad if you don't go too hard on her. Aw, look at my babies! You all look so cute. Welcome, kids. You're so cute. There you go. All right. Grandma, I'm a rookie. I don't know any songs. Don't listen to your grandma. -Just roll with it, honey. -Mithat, don't go near the table. -Aykut? -What's up, Mithat? Mom went nuts. For God's sake, stop making me nervous, Mithat. I don't even have my ID yet. I need to apply for a new one. You'll get one of the new cards. Is that so bad? -Thank you, man. -No problem, brother. -Is Selbi with you? -No. She has to do her hair or something. Yeah. She needs to dress up, apparently. Where will you meet her? At the courthouse. I don't have time. Let's just talk later. I'll pick her up, then. What's going on? Ms. Selbi, let's go if you're ready. -Go where? -To the courthouse. Aykut asked me to pick you up. No, thanks. I don't like motorcycles. I'll go myself. The deadline for the documents is soon. Aykut said, "I trust you, Mithat. Just go pick her up." -Is that so? -Yeah. Fine. Let's go. Don't be scared. You threw me off a roof. What are you talking about? Let's just move past that. This is my helmet? -How do I put it on? -Here. -Is it properly on? -Yeah, it is. Let's go. Now… -Yeah? -Hold on to me. You're crazy. I'm not hugging you. Hold tight. Hold what? Slow down! Please stop being so nervous. Look. This is the end of it. It's all over now. I can't. It's not over till I say it is. -You will. Calm down. -No. -I have to see it. -You will. Is that Mithat? We're here. Who's "we," Mithat? Selbi… Aykut, Selbi's not here! Selbi? You destroyed him. -Selbi… -Calm down. I'm sure she's wherever she fell off. What the hell, man? Be careful, man. There there. EMERGENCY ROOM Thank God you're alive. Selbi? You okay? I didn't even realize. I'm so sorry. You were just gone. -Who are you people? -What? I don't know you. What do you mean? I'm your husband. My husband? What is he saying? -Sorry to see what happened. -Thanks. -What are you to her? -I'm her husband, sir. -Let's talk. -Sure. He's my "husband." There's no way he is. -What's wrong? -Short-term memory loss. It's due to the trauma she endured. It's called amnesia. -When will she get better? -We can't tell. Maybe in a minute, maybe in a week. I have something more important to discuss, though. -Like what, sir? -A very rare condition. Oh, no. -It's the first time I've seen it. -Come on, sir. -Your wife… -Yeah? …started speaking Azerbaijani when she woke up. Sir, she is Azerbaijani. Have a nice day. -Let's just go. -What? Fresh air would be better for her than that doctor. I swear this is a nightmare. I swear it is. I just can't seem to wake up. What's my name? What is it? Aykut… Are you helping her cheat? This is not a quiz! I don't want her to be upset. What the hell is this, even? Just look at us. The family trusted me, and I keep lying to them. Enough. This can't go on. I'm going to tell them everything. I have a solution. I swear I do. Let's make her sign an empty piece of paper, okay? We'll handle the procedure before she recovers. You'll get the bills back so you won't have to pay. -That's ridiculous. -Why? It's just a signature. Let's get it over with. It's just a signature, huh? Have you ever thought about why she left her home and moved here? Or why she's going through all this with three strangers? -Have you? -No. Of course you haven't, because you're selfish. I won't do anything without her consent. You're doing the same thing! You're running away. I thought we were in this together. I can't believe you'd do this, man. Shame on you. Why didn't you tell them in the first place, then? Do you want to know why? I had my fishing rod with me when my dad left me at the orphanage. You know why? Because I thought we were going fishing, Talat. I was naive then too. I didn't say a single word to anyone until I was 12. Then I had a new teacher. She caressed my head. I spat on her, hit her. She didn't stop. She was the first person I could trust, because she didn't give up on me. It's easy to lose someone, but it's so hard to win someone over. It takes effort. That's what Mrs. Muazzez taught me. -My mom? -Yes, your mom. She was my teacher. I'm leaving now. I'm going to tell them everything. Don't worry. I won't throw you under the bus. Not for your sake, though. For my teacher's sake. I'm sure you'd move on, but I don't want her to be upset. -You need to pump it. -I can handle it. -Let me. -Stay away. -Come on. -Go away, man. Fine. Go ahead, then. Wow. Welcome, Aykut. I'm married. -I can't hear you. -I'm married. Gülşah, I'm married. Selbi isn't Mithat's girlfriend, but my wife. Are you kidding me? Some people took my ID and married us without me knowing. I'm sure Talat did it. -Talat? -What? -It's not his fault-- -Stop defending that clown. He's been doing this stuff for gambling money. Why can't he just leave us alone? Aykut, what did I tell you? I know. You're right. But it happened. I mean… I did try telling you, but… But I was scared. Why? I was scared you'd think I'm naive. Bravo, Aykut. I mean it. I asked you for something. -I told you we were-- -Stop, Dad. Don't push him. It's not his responsibility to solve our financial issues. -He's right. -This mansion has been-- Who cares, Dad? We can live somewhere else, right? Is this our biggest concern right now? -God damn it. -I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I had to tell you. I ruined everything. I'm so mad at you for lying to me. I'm sorry. But I'm even madder at myself. We put so much pressure on you because of the inheritance. Our love should've been the priority. I wish Grandma didn't put a clause in her will. We wouldn't be under so much pressure. I made a mistake. Let's just postpone the wedding. The family needs to solve its own issues first. But there's no issue. She lost her memory. I felt sorry for her. The doctor said she'd recover in a few days, so-- Aykut, don't you realize how ridiculous everything has gotten? I'm trying hard to fix it. We shouldn't have gotten you involved. We all but begged you to marry me, Aykut. Don't say that. Some things just can't be forced. But I love you so much. I don't feel forced. I love you too, but this is wrong. I've embarrassed myself. The number you have called cannot be reached at the moment. Please-- -Hang on. -I'm waiting. -She doesn't want to talk. -Is that so, Lieutenant? She's right. I know. I haven't been good to her, but can't she give me another chance? She lost her memory. That's why I'm so concerned. She's foreign, you know. -I don't know where-- -Aykut? What would she… I found her. Bye. Selbi, where have you been? I've been worried sick. My memory is back. I just wanted to observe you a bit. And? Are you okay? -Aykut, look. -Yeah? I'm not a greedy person. I just want what's rightfully mine. But when I realized you're good people, I kind of played you. We did throw you off a roof. I like you people. You're a good man. Thanks. -You love her too. -Gülşah. -You love Gülşah very much. -So much. Let's get divorced. Take the bills. -No way-- -Take it. -No. -Come on. But you don't have any money. Talat took care of that. Brother? I finally sold my land in Greece. Here. Your car keys. I'm sure you tricked some poor sap again. No. He's being honest. Is he? He paid my share. I confiscated the rest so he wouldn't gamble. -But, honey-- -Don't you dare. I'm surprised he didn't run away. You can't when there's someone who trusts you. Oh, yeah? And who would trust you? You. I trust everyone, man. You're right, actually. So let's just go get you two divorced before you lose the one you love. -Let's go. -No need to rush. The wedding's off. -What? -Seriously? Gülşah decided so. I didn't tell them the truth on time. I told them just as they were about to lose the mansion. But you love her. Go win her over. That's the problem. She thinks I was forced into it. -She said that? -Yeah. -What else did she say? -That they put me under so much pressure. That they all but begged me to marry her. That she's embarrassed. It was horrible. Really? Gülşah's usually a very decisive person. She wouldn't have said yes to the proposal if she were going to do this. I mean… There hasn't been a proposal, per se. Things just happened, and-- You really are naive. So naive. Are you insane? Of course she'd think that if you didn't propose, man. -Is that so? -Go propose to her. She'll come around. -She will? -What are you good at? -Folk dancing! -Come on, man. Something better. Something more romantic. I have an idea, but… -So? -I'm not sure it'd work. What is it? Can you read me a story, Auntie? Me? -She's talking to you. -She said "auntie." -I'm going. -Wait. -It worked. -Yeah. All right. -Come on. -Let's go. Sude, what's going on? Surprise. I'm glad I got robbed I'm glad I got tricked I'm glad I trusted anyone and everyone I'm glad I ran into you There's just one thing I regret I never asked you Will you take my hand? Will you grow old with me? There's just one thing I regret I never asked you Will you let me spend my life with you? Will you grow old with me? Will you marry me? -Aykut! -Oh God! Oh my God. What did she say? Did she say yes? He's so clumsy. -Hello. -Welcome. -Welcome. -Hi. Welcome. Welcome. -Welcome. -Hello. Welcome. Welcome, Alev. -Hello. -I'm so glad you came. -It's wonderful to see you here. -Go ahead. We wouldn't miss it. -You look beautiful. -Thank you. -You look handsome yourself. -Yeah? Dude, you're making me dizzy. Just stop. Calm down. I don't know, man. I'm not used to everything going well. I'm scared something will go wrong. No, man. I'd have to yell "You're siblings!" to break it up at this stage. No one would believe you anyway. You look nice. I was so mad at you at first. -What? -What? What did I even do, man? You jackass. Don't get too comfortable, though. This is just the beginning. -We'll see. -Oh, we will. By the way, you have a guest. Go on. Talk to her. Mrs. Muazzez? Welcome. -Hey, Mithat! -I'm honored. Congratulations, Aykut. I'm so happy. Thank you. I'm so glad you're here. Talat told me everything. I don't know if I had an influence on you, but you changed my life with what you did for my son. -Thank you so much. -Oh, ma'am. Don't say that. I feel embarrassed. You taught us so many good things. I'm sorry to say this, but there's no cure for your son. He's insane. He's one of a kind. Always stay kind and pure, all right? It's the most important thing in life. Let's go, Mom. He froze. Never mind him. Aykut, you're a lucky man. Go away, Mithat. You're embarrassing me. Go away. I'm so excited. Me too. -Shall we? -Let's. AYKUT ASLAN & FRIENDS AYKUT ASLAN & FRIENDS Dear guests, our cute couple's application was reviewed by the city, and everything seems to be in order. Let's ask them before you once more.
