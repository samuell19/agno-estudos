This is an automated test of your digital phone line. Sorry for the interruption. Charlie. Victor. Whiskey. - Zero. - Edward. - X. - Lincoln. - Ida. - Alpha. - Frank. - Alpha. You're awake, Mama. Morning, angel. How did you sleep? Not very well. I'm sorry. You ready? How do you feel? A little stiff. Go slowly, and I'll make some tea. Mmm-hmm. Squeeze mine. Good. Hello. You're late. Are you in a rush? Always, I'm a busy woman! Toi toi, my darling. I should be back at 10:00. Okay. Hello, Leni. Hello, my beauty. Tonight, you are the pride of Russia. May I present my niece, Dominika Egorova? And Dmitri Ustinov, a valued friend to the arts. If there is ever anything I can do for you, don't hesitate to ask. May we have a photo? Yes. American! American! Don't shoot! American! American! Get on your knees! Ow! Did you hear anything? As far as we know, he got away clean. They'll be in your apartment by now. Anything sensitive? No, no. Of course not. Okay, you'll fly to D.C. in the morning. It'll be a stink, but we'll get you out. Doesn't look like anyone was actually killed... but Washington has questions. So I gotta ask, what the fuck were you thinking? I was protecting my asset. How'd that work out? He got away, didn't he? Well, I guess you should hear it from me. Those guys in the park? Word is they were vice cops, looking for Chechen dealers... or some family guy getting a blow job in the bushes. They weren't there for Marble. They just got lucky. Chances are they would have questioned you, and let you go. But you can bet your ass they're looking for him now. They are expecting you, Deputy Director. Thank you. Terrible news about your niece. I trust she's recovering. She's in surgery now. But the prognosis for her leg is not good. Sorry to hear that. Drink? That depends. What's the occasion? I think you'll want one. There was an incident last night, at Gorky Park. Undercover narcotics agents saw what they thought... was a drug deal in process. When they moved in to question this man... the other man fired his weapon. A clear attempt at distraction. Now we know his name is Nate Nash. Officially, a commercial counselor, but he's CIA. He left the country this morning on a diplomatic passport. However, the man he was meeting... doesn't panic, doesn't run. He simply walks away. My question is... who is he? Your Uncle Vanya has come to visit the invalids. You look well. Doctor said you wouldn't be walking for months. Doctors don't know everything. No, they don't. I'll make some tea. Let me help. I'm glad my brother isn't here to see what that clumsy fool did to you. It would have broken his heart. It was an accident. Are you smoking? I can smell it on you. Why not? I've heard they already have a replacement for you at the company. This girl named Sonya. Apparently she's good. Not as good as you, but with time she can learn. Have you read the reviews? Competitive as you are. Have you come to commiserate, Uncle? No, I've come to help. Tell me, this apartment, it belongs to the Bolshoi, right? How long do you think they will let you stay here... now that you are no longer part of the company? Three months, six months? If they are generous. And what about medical coverage for your mother? They pay that as well, right? Yes. Does she know? She's not stupid. Of course not. And I know I haven't been around as much since my brother died. But I'm here now. And I want to help you. So come see me when you're ready. Please. I have something for you. You know, Dominika... there are no accidents. We create our own fate. Sonya? Hey. How are you? What is it? I'm scared. I went to see her at the hospital. The way she looked at me, she knows. She doesn't know. What we have done is a sin. They've always favored her. No one else ever got a chance. Is that fair? Isn't that a sin? Good! I think it's enough for tonight. Get some rest. In three minutes. There's been an accident at the Bolshoi Theatre. Women's locker room. Please hurry. Leni? Mama? Mama? What? What happened? No one was here. Where was Leni? The Bolshoi said they wouldn't pay her anymore. I'm going to take care of us. I'm gonna take care of us now. Could have come to my office. It's cold outside. Not yet. You broke her jaw. You always had a temper, haven't you? You said you could help us. If you help me. So what do you want me to do? State security is interested in knowing more about Dmitri Ustinov. You met him at the Bolshoi. Remember? He likes you. A broken bird that he could help. Something his ego won't be able to resist. So in a few weeks, when your leg is better... I want you to get to know him. And get close to him. And win his trust. How do you propose I win his trust? You've always known how to put on a show, Dominika. Find someone else. Have you ever seen a state-run hospice? Rats in the hallways, patients lying in their own waste? If you do this, Dominika... I will make sure your mother can keep her doctors. And I can make sure you can stay in your apartment. But only if I can show you can be of value to the state. It's one night. That's all I ask. Do this for your mother, Dominika. He has dinner at the Hotel Andarja every Friday at 9:00. A car will arrive at your apartment to bring you to the hotel. Now, you carry nothing with you. We will arrange a room and something for you to wear. Make yourself presentable. And wear your hair the way you wore it that night at the Bolshoi. And let him see you. Just sit at the bar. Now, he sits at the same table, overlooking the restaurant. You will stand out from the sort of women who tend to go there. I'm certain he will initiate contact. And just do what he asks. And when he drops his guard, I want you to replace his phone with a duplicate. I will make sure you are safe. Glass of champagne, please. Certainly. Dominika Egorova. What a pleasure. May I join you? Actually, I'm waiting for a friend. Then let me keep you company while you wait. Please. Terrible what happened to you. Just bad luck. I don't think you believe that. My father drank himself to death by the age of 43 and left us with nothing. Now, I could buy this place and anyone in it. Is that luck? You think anyone born in my situation could have done the same? There is no such thing as luck. Just like you being here. There is no friend, is there? Tell me the real reason you are here. I came to see you. And what is it you want from me? All I ever wanted was to be a dancer. Ever since I was a small child... when I would take the bus to rehearsal after school... and I would look out of the windows at the people going about their lives... going to work, half-asleep... and I would tell myself... "I'm not like them... "and I never will be... "because I'm special." I want to be special again. It's a beautiful room. I'm surprised you can afford it. Will you excuse me, for just a moment? Of course. Can we be alone? Take off your dress. Take off your dress. Come here. May I? A crack in the vase. True value comes in the smallest imperfection. A defining detail... that makes it worthy of collection. Slow down. Okay. Slow down. No, no! Slowly! Slowly! Hey! Hey, you! How did it happen? Ustinov dismissed his security, so I saw an opportunity, and I took it. Why would he do that? She asked him to. She could be useful. She's a witness. Get rid of her. I trust her discretion. If I were you, I would be very sure. Who is she? My niece. The dancer? Yes. Shame. You knew what would happen, once I got him in that room, didn't you? You wouldn't have gone if I had told you what had to happen. I would have had a choice. You know what I do. You came to me. That was your choice. You are my uncle. I would never have let him hurt you. He was inside me. I don't want to die. You don't have to. There's another life for you, if you want it. You have potential, great potential. Now, you did well to get him alone. What you said in that bar was exactly right... because you told him exactly what he needed to hear. There is a program that can teach you everything you need to know. The training is very hard. Only a few make it. But you know how to survive. That's why I chose you. Unless if I'm wrong. Perhaps you don't like my line of work. Perhaps you disapprove. In that case... your future will be out of my hands. I'm sorry. Morning, Mama. What is it? I have to go away for a while. Leni will come stay. It's something your uncle has arranged. I'll be able to take care of us now. You don't have to do this. It's too late for that now. Oh, no. What have you done? I'm sorry. Now, I warned you about him. The way he looked at you as a child. Mama. I tried to keep him away. I tried to protect you. You hold something back, hmm? Don't give him all of you. That is how you survive. Yes, Mama. Welcome to State School Four. You will know me as Matron. Inside, you will find the name you will use during your training. Under no circumstances will you reveal your true name... or any other personal information, to a cadet or member of staff. Is that understood? Yes. Good. I'll show you to your room. You're not like our usual recruits. Most of them come from the military with some training already. You'll have to work hard to catch up. I will do what is asked of me. I'm sure you will. But someone like you does not end up here by choice. A prima ballerina with a uncle in the SVR. What is your crime? Well, I suppose it doesn't matter. If you cannot be of service to the state, I am to put a bullet through your head. The Cold War did not end. It shattered into a thousand dangerous pieces. The West has grown weak. Drunk on shopping and social media. Torn apart by hatred between the races. And as a result, the world is in chaos. Only Russia is willing to make the sacrifices required for victory. For there to be peace... we must once again place ourselves at the head of nations. From this day forward, you will become Sparrows. Weapons in a global struggle for power. You have been selected because of your beauty. Because of your strength. And in some cases because of your vulnerability. Katya, Viktor, come here, please. Here, we deal in psychological manipulation. You'll be trained to determine a target's weakness... to exploit that weakness through seduction... and to extract information. Take off your clothes. Your body belongs to the state. Since your birth, the state nourished it. Now the state asks something in return. You must learn to sacrifice for a higher purpose. To push yourself beyond all limitation... and forget the sentimental morality with which you were raised. Or is it pride? In my experience, the proud are the first to fall. Viktor, put on your clothes. They're ready for you. It is the recommendation of this panel... that you be suspended indefinitely from foreign assignment. You'll be staying here in the States, Nate. So who's gonna handle Marble? That's no longer your concern. Simon... I've been with this guy for three years. He is not going to deal with anybody... that he doesn't know, and doesn't trust. Like I said. That is no longer your concern. Metka. An invisible chemical compound tailored to each subject. Worn on the hands, after intimate contact... the subject will be traceable for up to six weeks. Every human being is a puzzle of need. You must learn to intuit what is missing. Become the missing piece... and they will give you anything. This man is a diplomat at the Dutch Embassy with access to NATO military planning. Six years ago, his marriage ended... when the police were called to his apartment for a domestic disturbance. His wife accused him of inappropriately touching their daughter. Several nights a week, he hires girls. Runaways. Addicts. What does he want? He wants something rough. He goes to runaways because they cannot call the police. No. You disagree? He wants a daughter... someone to take care of, and he'll pay for it. Very good, Katya. He never touches the girls. He buys them dinner. Next... This man represented Chuvashia in Parliament. He was a leading critic of the president, until he was arrested for indecency. What did he want? He looks like a degenerate. By a degenerate, you mean a homosexual? - Yes. - Correct. Though, we mustn't be so judgmental. We all have our passions. His happen to be rather young. Anya, come here for a moment. Here he is. Give him what he wants. What do you mean? You called him a degenerate? Therefore, he doesn't want what's between your legs. So, be a boy. On your knees. Not the first time, I'm sure. Must have been some boy in a field behind your house. A girl in a rainy bus stop? We'd like to think it makes a difference. But it doesn't. It's just flesh. I can't! Yes, you can. Tomorrow, you'll try again. And again the day after that. You must inure yourself to what you find repellant. Find beauty in the human delusion... that the pleasures of the flesh will make us whole again. Even when the subject is repellant, the body can be tricked. A graze of the fingers to the thigh... brings blood to the groin. Manipulation of the nipple... leads to arousal. Audio cues trigger... sexual desire. But physical manipulation is not enough. You must learn to love on command. What is it to be loved? To be seen. To be recognized. To feel no longer alone. Wall will handle from the top of the key, right side. Goes down low to Smith. Double team coming, swings it back out to Wall. Fifteen-foot jump shot from the left wing... Too strong off the back iron. Rebound, fought for and controlled there by Sellers... The big man, ninth year out of Colorado State... When did you first notice the tail? Week ago. And what do you make of that? If the Russians are still following me, it means they're looking for him. It means that Marble's still out there. He's still alive. As far as we know. You're not talking to him. Marble's refused all attempts at communication... over the last four and a half months. He will come out for me. I know you can't get me into Russia, but somewhere close. Somewhere in Eastern Europe. And SVR will be on me right away. Marble will get word. He's gonna surface. Otherwise, I guarantee you, he's just gonna stay silent. Simon, you gotta send me back. All right. But you got one assignment. You make contact, and you convince him to work with another officer. That'd be me. We'll be coming with you. Would you have a problem with that? No. No problem. These soldiers have been deployed overseas for almost a year. Welcome them home. Turn out the lights. No rush. What's your name? Pyotr. You have someone at home? Someone you think about? Close your eyes. Think of her face. Remember her smell, her touch... What can we say about this? Sweet, sentimental, maintaining control. But you chose a boy, Katya. And you chose a boy so you would not have to give yourself. Won't always be that easy. Next! Three days ago, Nash was reassigned to Budapest. I believe it is an attempt to re-establish contact with the mole. We have friends in Budapest. Have them pick him up, and extract the information directly. That means we have to explain to President... why every officer we have in Western Europe is snatched in retaliation. Vanya's correct. The president will not condone anything that antagonizes the Americans unnecessarily. Not yet. What do you propose, Ivan? Nash is a skilled officer. That night, in the park, he made a mistake. He reacted emotionally... which tells me he cares about the man. I propose we give him someone else to care about. You're accused of assaulting a fellow cadet. He tried to rape me. And your honor is worth depriving Russia of a promising cadet. It was never my intention to deprive Russia of anything. And yet here we are. Matron, what is your opinion? It's only been three months... but I believe Katya still has potential. I would like a moment alone with the accused. You did well with Ustinov in Moscow. That is why you were given this chance. You were told what would happen to you, if you fail here? Yes. So why not let him have you? I serve the state. I serve our president. I serve you, General. But I owe him nothing. What sort of man would send his niece to State School Four? A patriot. My wife and I saw you dance once. That was a different life. There are so many. Don't you find? You may go. Sparrows must harden themselves against the weak and sentimental... and see these things for what they are. Selfishness. Tell me, Katya... what does he want? Come forward. For the deception to be complete, you must hold nothing back. Nothing. Understand? Give him what he wants. Well? Turn around. I said, turn around! No. Don't look at her. I want to watch you do it. Look at me! Look at me. I said look at me! Well? What are you waiting for? I'm ready. Are you going to fuck me or not? Nothing? Shame. Bitch. Power. That's what he wants. Get dressed. There is a car waiting to take you to Moscow. I have done everything you've asked of me. On the contrary. You have done nothing I asked. But my superiors think otherwise. I suppose we'll find out. Goodbye... Dominika. Hello, Mama. It's you. I'm home. My baby... Hello? Yes. He'll never let you go. I'll find away. Welcome home. How are you? Have a seat. What can I get you? I'm not hungry. Oh, come on. You used to love this place when you were little. You were always so serious with your big, grown-up eyes in your child's face. What do you want, Uncle? There is a traitor highly placed in the government. Probably in one of the intelligence agencies. A mole. His last known contact... is an American now in Budapest. What I want from you is to get close to him. And establish trust. And then you bring me the name of the mole. You follow the trail wherever it leads you... you sacrifice whatever needs to be sacrificed. You understand? Yes, Uncle. This is for you. What is it? New passport. Credentials. New name. Katerina Zubkova. And what reward will they give you? A promotion? I understand you are angry with me. You sent me to whore school. I made you special again. You have a gift. Like me. You see through people. You see them for what they really are. And you always stay one step ahead. You do this for me, and I'll let you go if that's what you want. But I feel you won't. This is what you were meant to do. Yes, Uncle. Let's eat. Excuse me. - We'll have two of everything. - Yes, sir. How does that sound? Welcome to Budapest. You must be Katerina. Hello. You're pretty. I'll show you to your room. Bathroom is down the hall. I'm in there. And you're through here. I keep my door locked. If I were you, I'd do the same. Stay out of my way, and I stay out of yours, and we should get along fine. Is that clear? Yes. I imagine tomorrow you'll meet our station chief. A warning. Chief Volontov never met an idea he didn't want to take credit for. And he likes to try it on with the new girls... when he's not drooling after strippers. He's going to like you. Tell me about the American. He's not exactly match-fit. He swims every afternoon. Logs his time. But he drinks too much. He looks at pornography. Nothing out of the ordinary. Anal. Threesomes. Usually two men on a girl. No relationships to speak of. A few girls he's paid, couple of times... but then he feels guilty and over-tips. Perhaps we'd have more success if we knew what we were looking for. I'm offering the complete cooperation of my office. And in exchange, I hope that you will... keep us informed of your progress. Of course. Need a hand? No, it's all right. Want it to be good? Let me help you. Come on, give it to me. Every human being is a puzzle of need. Learn how to be the missing piece, and they will give you everything. You thought you were the only one? We'll always be their whores. Unless, of course, we have something they want. If I were you, I'd find something. The pool is open from 6:00 in the morning... until 10:00 at night from Monday through Friday. From 6:00 to 8:00 on weekends. No personal belongings are allowed on the pool deck. I made a mistake. Sorry. Hand in your membership card here for a locker key. You get your card back when you return the key. Any questions? No. How did you know I was Russian? It was just a guess. You speak well. I used to live in Moscow. Do you miss it? You know, food, people. So what do you do in Budapest? I'm a translator at the Embassy. You? Commercial counselor. Medical supplies. I've never seen you at any of the Embassy events. I haven't been here long. Excuse me. Blonde suits you, by the way. Have we met? I thought I saw you in the pool yesterday, and on the tram, I think. You're mistaken. Would you like to get something to eat with me? I know a Turkish place at the station. It's a shithole, but the food's pretty good. Maybe you know it. I'm not hungry. Perhaps another time? I'll see you at the pool, I guess. Your ID is missing. Are you sure? Yeah. I put it there myself. Sorry, I'll have to make you a new one. I've got your picture on file. Take your time. She came in under the name Katerina Zubkova. Registered as a translator for the Embassy. But her real name is Dominika Egorova. She used to dance with the Bolshoi. There's officially no record of her being SVR... but that's bullshit. She's here for Marble. I know it. Stay away from her. I think she's valuable. And now you think she's recruitable? Maybe. Okay, that's not what you're here for. Just keep doing what you're doing. Play dead. Put the ticks to sleep and pray Marble sticks his head out again... so we can get him back into play. That's the priority. She's Ivan Egorov's niece. Deputy director of the SVR? I have nieces. Spend most of their time exposing themselves on the Internet. Why would she use her real name? Because she's an innocent. Or because it's a provocation. Both of which are very good reasons to stay away from her. I think there's something about this girl. She's gold. I know it. Okay. See what you can find out. Thanks. Just go slow, all right? All right. Nate? Mmm-hmm? If she does let you fuck her, she's definitely SVR... because she's way out of your league. I need you to get me on the list for an event at the American Embassy. I could do that. Thank you. If... you give me a progress report in return. I've established contact. Contact? I thought you'd be on your back by now. You know... there were always stories about Sparrows. Capable of performing tricks on a man's mind. Not to mention, the rest of him. A magic pussy. That's what they say. Perhaps I will find out. Ooh! Just a bit of fun. But the offer stands. If you need help, don't hesitate to ask. After all, everyone needs a friend. The success of these efforts... will be critical for securing Hungary's economic ties with its neighbors. This is clearly a moment of rapid change in the world... making it imperative for each region to stay competitive. Thanks to the Hungarian President for hosting us... and to the American Ambassador for co-hosting. Lastly, I would like to thank my chief of staff, Stephanie Boucher... without whose hard work we would not be here tonight. Stephanie. Dominika Egorova. You know my name? You told me. You stole my ID from the pool. That would be illegal. Were you just looking for me? I'd know where to find you if I was. Listen, I'm curious, did you want me to know that you were following me... or are you just real clumsy? You Americans always think the rest of us are so interested in you, don't you? So what made you wanna become a translator? I'm sure if you know my name, you found out other things about me. I have wondered what it would be like to pursue somethin' your whole life... and then have it ripped away from you. What's it like? Yeah, how does it make you feel? What does it matter? My mother is unwell. If I work for the government, the state helps me take care of her. My uncle helped me get the job. Your uncle is a very powerful man. In my country, if you don't matter to the men in power, you do not matter. Is it so different in your country? It's supposed to be, but... Are you a patriot? No. Then why do you do what you do? Beats selling tires. Have you ever sold tires? No. Then you can't know, can you? Good point. Hey, I'd like to see you again. Why, are we going to become friends? Is that what you want? I don't have any. There's a Russian restaurant right by the opera. Have dinner with me there. Tomorrow at 8:00. Okay. Marta? You're home. That was him at the Embassy. It was. Playing hard to get, are you? No substitute for a good old-fashioned blow job in my experience. He's not like that. What's this? A copy of the report Volontov sent to Moscow three days ago. Apparently, you've made an enemy. Evening. Good evening, sir. This is a coincidence? You were right. I do need a friend. Everyone needs a friend. I need you to send a report... that you are impressed with the progress I've made with Nash. I need more time. And I would owe you. How do I know you pay your debts? You were right about Sparrows. We are special. Do you know what they teach us? How to determine what a lover needs. And I knew what you needed from the first time I ever saw you. Someone not to laugh at your microscopic prick. Get your hands off me. Look at the camera over my left shoulder. Tomorrow you will write a favorable report, or I'll have you arrested for assault. You'll be recalled to Moscow, and your career will be over. Good night. Hello? This is an automated test of your digital phone line. Sorry for the interruption. - Alpha. - Charlie. - Zero. - Whiskey. Vienna. It's Dominika. Uh, come on up. Hey. Can I have a drink? Come in. Whiskey. Thank you. So do you wanna tell me what happened? My pig boss is insulted I don't want to sleep with him. What's his name? Maxim Volontov. I've heard of him. How did you know where I live? Why did you leave Russia? I screwed up at work. Why would a CIA officer fire his gun in a public park? I did it for a friend. Because I knew what they would do to him. So do you. What do you want, Dominika? I think you should probably go home and figure it out. See you tomorrow. You know where to find me. Katerina. You changed your hair. I will leave you. Nice to meet you. Would you prefer a drink? Sure. But I don't have much time. I didn't know you were coming. What's the occasion? Do I need one? I'm on my way to Vienna for a meeting... and I thought I'd look in on you. What happened to your eye? I bumped it at the pool. You have any news about our American friend? He's begun to lower his guard around me. He told me about what happened at the park after I established trust. Hmm. So how was he? Unmemorable. But he's handsome, right? Is he? Is there anything out of the ordinary that you would like to report? If you lose contact... or if he goes missing for a day or more... you need to let me know, because our superiors are getting impatient. I have something for you. Something new. A case with great potential. I thought I made it very clear you only have one mission. A Russian agent inside the American government... is always of value, is it not? Marta and I are developing the asset together. A senator's chief of staff. And she is willing to cooperate? She's compromised. She has no choice. When do you see her again? In London. In a week's time. But we need more money. Blackmail will not be enough to establish long-term exchange. What did you have in mind? $250,000. That is a lot of money. But you can get it. Hmm. I have to leave. Oh, I forgot my coat. I'll get it. Thank you. I've waited a lifetime for something like Swan. I worked a year developing her. She's not yours to trade. Now you have the money to make the exchange. I will make sure you get the credit. I just need more time. Please. What do they have on you? I saw something I was not supposed to. What did you see? You don't get Swan for free. I was there the night they killed Dmitri Ustinov. For telling you that, they would cut my throat. Will you help me? I don't have a fucking choice. What would you give me if I told you how to get rid of Katerina? What do you want? Oh, am I too late? Sorry, we're closed. You can come back in the morning. We open at 9:00. I'm not going to be here tomorrow. Is there any way you can make an exception? Please. I wanted to open an account for a family member... in case anything happens to me. I can't let you in. Well, maybe you could get the form, and I could buy you a coffee? We could fill them out together. Do you have your passport, and all the information? Yes. Yes, I have it all here. Okay. Excellent. Oh, thank you. Marta? Marta? Ever been on a farm? That's what it smells like, when you butcher an animal. I took my time with her. So you would see what happens when you tell secrets. Please, please, please. This is your only warning. Now... call the police. Where the fuck have you been? Close your door. So, Marble surfaced. Jesus Christ. Here? Vienna. You don't say anything? What is that? It's a warning. She is a fucking Sparrow. Told you she was way out of your league. I think she's still recruitable. Now that we know what we're dealing with, maybe even more so. If she's a Sparrow... we can't trust a fucking word that comes out of her mouth. Yeah. When? And you came home to find her like this? Yes. This wasn't just a break-in. This was torture, punishment. Any idea why someone would do this to her? What happened to your eye? Did you get along with her? You seem upset. Of course I'm fucking upset! You know something, don't you? Whoever it is you're shielding... whoever you are scared of... we can protect you. May I go? I'm assuming you guys were pretty close. You must be pretty scared. For yourself. When I was in Moscow, they talked about a program that Khrushchev had set up. Young officers. Trained to seduce and manipulate. They called 'em Sparrows. That is what she was, right? The thing I just cannot wrap my head around... is why a man would put his niece through somethin' like that. I was told to take a man to a hotel. To get information. They said he was an enemy of the state. And in exchange, my mother would get the doctor she needed. Instead, they cut his throat, and he died on top of me. There could be no witnesses, so my uncle gave me a choice. Die, or become a Sparrow. What they did to Marta was a message. They cut her open to show me what they'll do to me... if I don't give them what they want. What do they want? A name. They think you're running an agent. What do you think? I don't care. I just want my mother to be safe. The men that you work for, men like your uncle... they'll never let you go no matter what you give them. It's how they function. You only matter because of what you can do for them. You don't exist unless they say so. And not just now. I mean, when you were dancing... you were dancing for them. Because they were lettin' you. I mean, you see it now, right? You belonged to them, pretty much your whole life. So, Dominika, work with me. Make this something that you own for the first time in your life. And make them fucking pay. What is it you want from me? Whatever you can give us. But if I had my choice... access to your uncle. Be your spy? Is that any different from being his? Yeah, because I would never ask you to do what he did. Nothing's worth that. I need to sleep. Why don't you take my room? You know, you asked me why I fired the gun in Moscow? Well, the man I was protecting had everything to lose. He was benefiting from the system... but when he saw what was happening in his name... he didn't just say that he didn't know. He risked his life. He risked everything. He didn't deserve to die in a cellar somewhere. If you do this... I'll do everything in my power to protect you. Can I trust you? I promise you can. Wait. Wait, don't. Hey. Thank you. I danced my first solo to this. It's Grieg. I was so nervous the night before, I couldn't sleep. And I played this music in my room... and, after I fell asleep, I dreamed that... the music was color, and I could paint... over all the audiences' faces with my hands. I'm sorry about what happened to you. But I'm really very glad that you're here. Me too. Are you sure about this? Okay. Well, listen. This is what I want you to do. Go back to your normal routine. Go into work, and write a report about me. About the time we spent, and how close we've gotten. Say that I'm a fool, and you've got me on the hook. Tell them that I'm ambitious, but that I drink. And that I have something to prove to my father... which means I will make a mistake. Then I need you to go home. Police will be finished with your apartment by this evening. Then just wait for my signal. Hello? I'm just gonna ask you some routine questions to begin. Name? Dominika Egorova. Did you eat breakfast this morning? Yes. Are you an officer of the Russian Intelligence Service? Yes. Are you here because CIA Officer Nate Nash recruited you? Yes. Are you willing to work for the American government? Yes. And you intend to give us genuine information? Yes or no? Yes. Why would you do that? I thought it was just yes or no? I'm just curious. I know the nature of the men I work for. So why work for them? They gave me no choice. I have a question. You only spike when Nate's name comes up. Did you engage in sexual intercourse with him? Hey, that's... Take it easy. Because that's what you do, right? Marty? Marty. That's what you're trained for. Anybody ever tell you that... Why do you need to know, bratok? Big brother? Please answer the question. We'd need to know if you're emotionally involved. The answer is no. So, are you satisfied? Yeah. If I am to work for you... I will need money transferred to a bank account in Vienna. $30,000 to start. I don't know what you and Nate discussed... but I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves. We'd have to see what you brought us. If it's significant... What about a senator's chief of staff? Excuse me? A chief of staff run by the SVR? She's agreed to sell information on a satellite defense system. I'm to fly to London on Friday to meet with her. Shall I provide you with the account information? Oh, there she is. It's to the left. We'll get it. We're good. What are you doing here? Thought you might need some help after what happened to poor Marta. Of course, you were lucky not to be harmed yourself. I appreciate your concern. Though I do wonder how Swan would react if she saw me with you. Do you really want to be the one to blow this whole operation? Director Egorov would be very displeased. Go upstairs, room 624. I'll call you if I need you. Go. - Who the hell is that? - He's got a key. Did she say anybody else was gonna be in that room? No. I think that's... Yeah, it's Volontov. That's her boss. Vodka. Do I know you? We have a friend in common. Where is she? Unfortunately, Marta wasn't able to make it. So she sent me. Oh. I'll just be leaving. You really think I care if people know who I'm meeting with? I think in this case, you might. Marta's a known intelligence officer. If photographs of your relationship were to go public... you would lose your security clearance, and your job. But I don't think that any of that is necessary. You're here for business, as am I. $250,000 was the figure that you agreed upon. Your daughter's tuition payments are coming up. I believe your ex-husband is about to lose another job. Don't you think you would be more comfortable in a private room? Where do they find you? Follow me. All right, here we go. Mmm-hmm. Let's get this show on the road. This is Colonel Maxim Volontov. He's the chief of the Budapest rezidentura. Make me a drink, would you, Boris? Let's get on with it. You heard her. Make her a drink. So. Shall we proceed? I just want to be clear. I'm here in a strictly exploratory manner. As long as what you have to offer is of value... I'm sure we will have no difficulty. I'm chief of staff to a United States senator. Last person that had my job's head of the fucking CIA. Being in the room with me. Fucking value. Oh, I think she's drunk. You think? She's drunk. And I'm sure that if you are as important as you say you are... then you don't want to waste any time. So, do you have anything to sell? I have the first set of discs with me. Today. I just want to be clear that I'm not doing this... 'cause I'm an ideologue or pacifist or something, you know. Where are the discs, Stephanie? Where's my money? $250,000 per delivery as agreed. Yep. Oh, sorry. I just need to authenticate them. Why don't you give me a real pour, huh, Boris? Why don't you get it yourself? Don't mind if I do. Everything all right? I just have to wait for them to load. Tell me, Boris. You got a little babushka back in Moscow? 'Course you do. Never ceases to amaze me. Why are Russian women so sexy? All the men look like toads. No, no, no. No. Don't you. Where are you going? I'm gonna go buy her some time. Why is it taking so long? Just one more minute. God, who the fuck is that? Just checking. Is everything all right with your room, sir? Fine. Shall I check the minibar? There's no need. Sorry to disturb you. It's finished. Everything seems to be in order. Good. Because if I have to spend another minute with this cunt... I'm going to shoot her in the face. Did she get 'em? She did. Nice accent. We'll leave now. You wait an hour and then you go. We'll be in touch for the next delivery. Sure thing. Fuck it. Oh. Oh. Oh. She took the money. She took the money! There you go. Go get the discs, take them back to the field office. I will follow as soon as I get this squared away. Yeah? Make the necessary arrangements. Change of plans. We go directly to Heathrow. Moscow wants to congratulate us in person. I'll call Director Egorov. No need. Director Egorov gave the order himself. The discs and your passport. Turn the car around. Yeah? Boucher is dead. What are you talking about? Our guys outside went after the money too early. She panicked. Stepped in front of a fucking truck. What the fuck? You think they had somebody in the hotel? I would've. If they think she tipped us off, they're gonna kill her. And Nate, the tail said her car changed direction. Looks like they're headed to Heathrow. Fuck, Trish. We fucked her. We have fucked her! You look nervous. They're entering terminal two. Looks like Aeroflot. This is a boarding announcement. British European Airways Flight 422 to Amsterdam... will begin boarding shortly. Will all passengers please proceed to Gate B-42. Passport? Enjoy your flight. Fuck! I always had my doubts about her. She's my niece. What? My brother's daughter. Give me the discs. Please. Of course. Thank you. Take him away. Did you give Ms. Boucher to the Americans? No. Who did? I don't know. You can start. Let's start again. Did you give Boucher to the Americans? No. Did you give Boucher to the Americans? No. Are you working for the Americans? I love my country. You gave Boucher to the Americans. For money? Or for the handsome American? No. Did you tell the Americans about Boucher? No. Last time. Did you tell the Americans about Boucher? No. Last time. Did you give Boucher to the Americans? No. Please. Make it stop. You made a mistake. It's not your fault. But you have to tell them what they want to know. Please. I can only protect you if you tell me the truth. The truth? There is no other mission but this one. Follow the trail wherever it leads. Sacrifice whatever has to be sacrificed. If they have my real name... if they have Swan... if you torture me... they will trust me. How could they not? You don't want to give up now. Send me back. Let me finish what we started. Didn't I do well, Uncle? Didn't I? Oh, my child. What happened to you? I was questioned by Security Services. But they let you go? Of course. I'm innocent. Chief Zakharov is expecting you, Deputy Director. The president is furious about the loss of Boucher. The mole would have got her anyway. Now we get something in return. His patience with your niece has grown thin. The Americans will trust her. So you say. I think Dominika has had her chance. It is my opinion she has developed feelings for the American. She has made a fool of you, Ivan. Send her back to Nash. Have Matorin shadow her. If she is compromised, he will find out. The Americans will respond. Nothing we can't weather. And what of Dominika? I leave that decision to her uncle. Shall we tell the president you prioritized... the safety of your niece over the mission? If she's compromised... I promise you, she will be eliminated. Thank you, Ivan. You're welcome, Chief Zakharov. Enjoy your night. I'd ask you how you got in, but this is what we taught you, isn't it? Did they grant my request? Yes, they did. You were right. I am like you, Uncle. Oh, God. Oh, thank God. You know what this looks like, right? They just let you go? Why would they do that? Because I told them that you would trust me now. Enough to give me the name of the mole. But you know that I can't do that. Of course I do. So what next, then? I want to go to America... where I can be safe. Please. All right. And my mother? It'll take some time, but we can get her out, yeah. And the money that I was promised? You'll get it. $30,000 in a bank in Vienna. We couldn't release payment while you were in custody. It's not enough. How much do you want? I need $250,000. For resettlement. Okay. You're helping me. For no obvious advantage. It's not what I expected. If I hadn't waved you off at the airport, what would you have done? I would've killed him for you. Nate? Nate? Do you know what this is? They use it for skin grafting. Burn victims. A blade so fine, you barely bleed. Do you know how long it takes to peel the skin from a human being? Hours. Even if you are very good at it. And I... I take my time with it. Layer by layer. Until I see the white of the bone. You know what we want to know... but I won't stop until long after you're ready to talk. If you pass out, I will inject you with a stimulant. You'll stay conscious until we're finished. What's the name, Nate? What's the name? No? You want more? No. Please. So we go deeper. No! No? Come on, Nate. The name. What's the name? No? Give it to me. Let me try. Wait, wait. Oh, God! No? Nate? Nate. Call the Embassy. The Embassy. It was you who killed Matorin, wasn't it? I can explain. I'm sure you can. My wife had dreams of being a dancer. Long before I met her. Of course she was nothing on you... but she used to dance for me in our living room. When she fell ill... the Russian Embassy in New York... refused to let an American doctor operate on her. Some petty bureaucrat I had offended... sentenced her to death. What passes for power. I know you gave the Americans Boucher. Only so they would trust me. And now we must trust you? I was born three days after Stalin was laid in state. My father fought for him during the war. He was a party member, we were privileged. It took me years to realize I had been born in a prison. Prison makes a beast out of a man. I learned to cheat, to lie... to do to others before they do to me. To survive, by any means. So I had to decide. Die in the prison where I was born... or choose another side. Our clumsy American friends... for whom individual freedom is at least an aspiration. So now you know. I am the mole. I am the man you are looking for. You're free to hand me over to your uncle... give the men who did this to you what they want and go home. Of course, there is another path. What would that be? After you turn me in, you will be a hero... beyond suspicion. The ideal position to take my place and continue my work with the Americans. Make your uncle and his kind pay for what they have done to our country. They'll kill you. Something will slay us all. You have the power to decide whether or not I die in vain. You are better at this than any of us. This is the only way for you to return to your mother. You sent Matorin, didn't you? So I wouldn't have a choice. So that you would see. You never did. Hello? Hello? I... Stop. Face the wall. I want to speak with the Russian ambassador. My name is Mikhail Sergev. I am the ambassador here in Budapest. Unfortunately, the Hungarians are waiving diplomatic immunity. Call Zakharov. Tell him I have what he wants. I have the name of the mole. Why don't you tell me? And I'll pass it along. Listen to me very carefully. You are an errand boy. I have an errand. You will call Zakharov. You will tell him to make a trade. Me for the mole. Once it is arranged, I will give the name to Zakharov personally. Do this right, Mr. Ambassador, and I might even tell them it was your idea. I'll see what I can do. Thank you, Director Zakharov. Speak of this to no one else. Yes, sir. No loose ends. Nothing that can come back on the president. And the girl? You can uncuff her. All right, this is how this is gonna go. Nate will escort you part of the way. Once he confirms the identity of our mole, you go on alone. You pass at the midpoint. Don't stop. Don't exchange a word. Don't look back. Anything goes wrong, we abort. You try to run, we are authorized to shoot. We won't hesitate, you understand? All right, Nate, it's time. Your uncle will be very proud. He might be. Are you gonna tell me how you found out his name? Is it going to make a difference? There is an investigation. They think it's me. I guess that was the play all along, huh? Stop here. I got him back for you. You think they're just gonna let him make it across alive? You realize you might have just got him killed? I think one day you will understand. No, I don't think I will. Some things can't be sacrificed. We don't throw people away. Show us his face! What the hell is going on? What is the delay? Confirm the identity of your agent! Yes! That's our man! She fucked them. Goodbye, Nate. Good morning. Please, sit. You were right about your niece. She did very well. She called from Budapest. Gave us the name of the mole. Wonderful news. I've had a security detail search the mole's office. His apartment. The apartment was covered in metka. Attributed to Nash. This is a statement... for an account opened in a private bank in Vienna... into which the Americans have recently made payments... of $250,000. Sort of money paid to a defector. The account is in your name with your passport number. Oh, I forgot my coat. I'll get it. You recently made a trip to Vienna, did you not? You know this is my niece, right? She's angry with me. This is one of the disks Boucher gave us. The disks you passed on to the president. Your personal victory. It's supposed to have come from the DOD. But at the request of your niece, we examined it more closely. The encryption signature suggests it was written in Langley. It's a fake. You are special. You have a gift. Like me. You see through people. You see them for what they really are. And you always stay one step ahead. Great family I have. You killed me. Didn't I do well, Uncle? Target is in range. Hello? Hello?
