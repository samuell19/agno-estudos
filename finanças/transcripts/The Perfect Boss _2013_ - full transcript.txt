Mike, I'm home. Mike? Oh, my god! Mike! Mike! Thank you. We'll send the housekeeper in to take care of it. Thanks for letting him know. Good afternoon, ma'am. Reservation for Jessica Slate. Ah, here you are. And they also dropped off your car. Well, valet parked it. Here's your ticket and here's - your room key. - It's a suite, right? Uh, no, ma'am, it's one of our Executive Floor rooms. King bed, very plush. I asked for a suite. I would like a suite. I can get you into a suite tomorrow afternoon. Yeah, OK, you do that. Yes, ma'am. Calls this plush. No, there was no sign of forced entry. The coroner's up there now. - His wife found him. - That's right. Let's get the photographer over here. Get a shot of that, will you? All right, what's the spread on that one? Six points? OK, I'll take the points on both games, 5K a pop. Got it? Gotta go. I have never seen anyone look so beautiful. Mmm. You did say the exact same thing to me two weeks ago. - Did I? - Mm-hmm. Well, it's obviously still true. Come on. Mickelson is throwing this shindig for me, so it would be rude if we were late. You rude? Never. - You do look beautiful. - Thank you. You have some big shoes to fill. - Everyone loved Jason. - I know. She's a sure thing. If anyone can save this company, - it's Jessica. - Hm. So, you were with Wizner Drugs before? Yes, yes, for six years. Is that where you met Cameron? No, no, Cameron and I met about 10 years ago. It was a lot smaller company called Diller McKay. - Hm, I've never heard of that. - Well, they were bought up by the Brits, and then everybody went their way. There he is. Max, honey, here's your new boss. Ah, Jessica, it's a pleasure. I'm sorry I couldn't be here to meet you when you came last week, but they had me in San Diego at a sales convention. Well, it is a pleasure to meet you. I've heard such wonderful things about you. I see you've met Max and Patty. Don't underestimate this one. You don't know, but she did this once before. If she hadn't convinced the FDA to fast-track Wizner's asthma medication, there'd be a lot of people still panting and wheezing. Which is a feeling that Ralph's intimately familiar with every time I get him on the squash court. - All down the dress. - It went, like, all the way frickin' down. Woo, sorry. You told me I could park here! They frickin' towed my car! Unused parking spot was too good to be true. Damn it! Oh, my god. My dad is going to kill me. - Yes, he is. - Hey, ladies! Wait, wait, wait. Isn't that the guy that got you the drink? - You girls need a lift? - Yes, it is. - I think we need to get him to give us a ride home. - I think we do too. - Hey! - Hey! Hi, boys. It's not about me; it's about the Ezaprine. You know, unfortunately, a company can't keep going - on old patents, so... - Wallace. I want to introduce you to Jessica Slate, our new executive VP. Jessica, this is Wallace Vandover. - I've heard a lot about you. - Likewise. And who is that? That's Wallace Vandover. He's with - the Walter Becker hedge fund. - Oh, the one that's gonna invest once the FDA approves Ezaprine. Exactly. He's giving us four weeks to get the green light, or the fund pulls out. Four weeks for FDA approval? I hope she can do it. You had the whole room eating from the palm of your hand. What does that feel like, anyway? As if you don't know. Nobody's as good as you are. When we actually get approval from the FDA for Ezaprine and I know that I've still got a job... maybe I should take you someplace. Like your bedroom? Oh, well, we'll definitely end up there, but, uh, I was thinking someplace more romantic, like, uh... I don't know, Tahiti. Cameron, I told you that I don't do committed relationships. What makes you think I would have changed my mind? - See you next week, Renee. - Good night. Shh. OK, see ya. So, all this talk about how your life is so much better without romance... Mm. Does that mean you're not gonna invite me up? Come on up. Where's your car? The car... Uh, yeah, I need to talk to you about that. Could you... possibly give me a ride to work? Where is it? It was totally Cat's fault. She told me I could park in a no-parking zone. It was towed? Or stolen, but I'm guessing towed. Renee... when is this behavior gonna stop? I mean, first you and Cat get evicted from your apartment, and now your car is towed! Don, it's a lesson. Next time she's gonna learn to read the parking signs more carefully, aren't you, honey? It's a lesson? Mm-hmm. I'm gonna be outside in six minutes. Be out there if you want a ride. Aye aye, Captain. Oh, uh, hey, did you want to sync our watches first? This is gonna be the longest ride ever. Then you'd better get ready. So, if you're not gonna give it your all, if you're not willing to do whatever it takes to make Mickelson Pharmaceuticals the number one drug company in the country, then leave, right now. You'll get three weeks' pension for every year you've been here, plain and simple. Just go. Is she serious? I'll give you 50 bucks to walk out right now. Good. That means you're all willing to give it your best. And if you do that, you will be rewarded. Each and every one of you should be taking advantage of the stock options, because in six months this company is gonna be worth more than you ever dreamed. The bottom line is this from now on, you eat, drink, and breathe Ezaprine. Clilamax was the past, it's history. Ezaprine is our future, and our future is very bright. This is Dr. Renfro. Uh, Dr. Renfro, this is Gena Ferris. My husband, Mike, was part of your clinical trials for Ezaprine. Yes, Gena. How can I help you? Um... I don't really know how to say this, but... Mike passed away unexpectedly yesterday. I'm so sorry to hear that. Thank you. Um... the reason I'm calling you is because I'm wondering if maybe his death could have been linked to Ezaprine. R&D's on the second floor. Just this way. We have 34 people - in Research and Development. - I wonder how much money they paid her to quit her job and come here. I would kill myself if I had to sit through lame meetings all day and read thousand-page documents about pills. When I get my med degree, there is no way I am wasting it here. I think I will do something a little more stimulating. Stimulating? Like what? I don't know yet. Maybe Doctors Without Borders, vaccinations in war-torn countries. Something fun like that. What? I'm serious. I know you were. Ah, yes, Lee and Mary, two of our special... special staff. They do a great job here. Pleasure to meet you, ladies. Pleasure. Looks good. Keep up the good work. - Thanks. - Thanks. I'll show you where Cameron's office is. Sorry to bother you. Just giving Jessica the tour. Welcome to R&D. This is where the real magic happens. I think this room is starting to fill up with a little hot air. Come on, let's go. I'll take you to your office and introduce you to Rob, your assistant. I'll get back to you. Hello? Hi. It's Jess. How are you? So, you all settled in at Mickelson? Yes, I am. Thanks. So, I'm coming to Maryland next Wednesday. Can you get away and help me celebrate? See, we're supposed to have a dinner at our friends' house. Oh, how lovely. What will they be having for dessert? I don't know. Well, I know what you'll be having. Uh, look, Jess, uh... it's... it's like I told you last time. I can't keep doing this. Why? Did your wife find out? Well, no, but it's just... OK, if you don't want her to, then I suggest you show up at eight. Same hotel. Well, with the fine, the tow, and the penalties... it's, uh... $525. Sorry, Dad. No, no, it... it's OK. Honey, we need to talk. Can we please not do this here? No, no, look, first I want to apologize for... for getting so angry this morning. But, honey, when are you gonna start taking your life seriously? I mean, how do you ever expect to get into med school when you're out partying with Cat every night? With my perfect 4.0 GPA is how I'm gonna get into med school, Dad. Like, sorry that the car got towed, but it's not like I crashed it into a pre-school. I know, but you showing up to work hung over all the time, it just... it makes me look bad. I mean, I put my neck out to get you that job. Dad, I'm a file clerk. I mean, seriously, the worst thing I could do is file a P in the Qs. Yeah, well, at the lab, it'd be gone forever. Ugh, God. Like, I'm never gonna be as anal as you... ever... so I need you to stop trying to change me. I'll try. OK? This is more like it. Hm. Hannah! Jessica! Hi, sweetie! What the hell are you doing in my room? And who let you in here? Why haven't you answered my calls? Oh, I helped myself to the mini-bar. Look at the bottles, how cute they are. So tiny, like they're made for little babies. How the hell did you find out where I'm staying, anyway? That's the first thing out of your mouth? Not "How you doing, Mom? Sorry I missed Mother's Day"? What do you want? Why didn't you tell me you got some job as a big wig at a company in Philadelphia? There's no smoking in here. Honey, you know I have to have a ciggy when I drink. OK, so, why don't you get up and get dressed, and we'll go someplace? Yeah, OK. Turn right in 50 feet. Right after I spoke to you, I talked to the medical examiner. He determined the cause of death to be acute - tubular necrosis. - Necrosis? Dr. Renfro, Mike was doing really well. He was active. His blood sugar was under control. Wait, wait. So... he was doing better? The best he'd been in years. We were even planning to go skiing in Aspen. I just... I just want to understand what happened. You deserve those answers. Can I, uh, take this with me? Sure. I'll make you a copy. Thanks. I want my fair shareof your 10 million. My 10 million? Um, and what makes you think that I have $10 million? It says so right there. Read it. That says stock options. And that is IF the drug gets approved and the hedge fund invests so the company doesn't fold. It says 10 million. OK, you don't know what stock options are, do you? Of course not. That is not money that I have in the bank. All I'm making right now is my salary. I need a new car. - You're not listening. - Where are you going? This conversation's over. Two grand a month in your bank is plenty. Why can't you just be happy for me without always wanting something? Oh, I am happy for you, but when I tell folks how great you're doing, they want to know why I'm still driving that hunk o' junk. When people ask where I got the new car, I'll tell them my successful daughter bought it for me. Go home, Hannah. You're not welcome here. Oh, oh, I'm welcome wherever I want to be welcome. So I said, "Don't come home, then". - Yeah. - Yeah. Anyhow, - oh, check this out. - Huh. You know something... - What else she say? - Oh, she said a lot. Don, the meeting's about to start. You coming? Oh, um, tell Cameron that I won't be there. I have something I need to look into. Sure. Everything OK? Yeah. Yeah, fine. You can fill me in later. OK. Welcome to Baltimore. We hope you enjoyed your flight and look forward to seeing you again soon. Mm, you're right on time. Uh, for the, uh, new executive VP. You're beautiful. Hey, honey. Do you want some spaghetti? I can heat you up a plate. No. No, no, thanks. I'm gonna be in my office. Honey, what's the matter? Nothing, dear. I'm fine. I just have some work to do. Let me get you a drink. Thank you. So, when are you going to tell me? Tell you what? What you want. What I want... ...is... that, uh, you get Ezaprine into the fast track and make sure that it's approved by the end of the month. The end of the month? - That's in less than four weeks. - I know. What, this is the... the drug that's gonna replace insulin, the pill you take once a week? It is gonna benefit a lot of people, including you, if we can get it approved on time. Well, I can tell you this it'll be approved, but four weeks is gonna be tough. Yeah, but you'll do it. Right? 'Cause if you don't, then Mickelson's gonna be in a lot of trouble. You know, and then I'd be out of a job, and, well, that's when I would do things I wouldn't otherwise do. Like... tell your wife about our ongoing relationship. Yeah, well, I don't respond well to threats, OK? No? Mm. So then let's just call her right now. OK, OK, OK, OK, look, look. I'll get it approved, all right? I'll do my best. Yeah, no, that's not good enough. I need your word. You have my word, all right? I'll get it approved. Thank you, Paul. Mmm. - Hello, Jessica? - Hello, Ralph. I thought you'd like to be the first one to hear the good news. - They've agreed to push it through? - Four weeks. I told you that I could get this done. So, I think we should go forward with our plan. Quick trip, but, uh, very productive. - I'll see you at the office, sir. - Yes, you will, my dear. Mmm. Everything comes so easy for you. What are you talking about? I mean, you're smart, you're beautiful, you're great with people. You got your contact at the FDA to do the impossible. Nothing comes easy for me, Cameron. I'm just really good at making it look that way. What... Why can't you see a future with me, Jess? I mean, think about it you and I, a power couple, we... conquer the world and make a tonne of money, and of course we screw on every quality beach on the planet. I've had sex on the sand, and it's very overrated. Oh, Jess. Mmm. Why won't you let me love you? Has that line actually ever worked on anyone? It doesn't mean I'm not sincere. Come on, Cameron. You don't love me. You don't love yourself. What you love is this lifestyle, and the only reason you're attracted to me is because I can help keep you in it. That is not entirely true. I've always found you intriguing. Cameron, you know you're the best partner I could ever think of. And, yes, our lives are intertwined because we are going to make a lot of money. But... just save all this whimsy and romance for some of your 20-year-old bimbos that actually find this stuff enticing. This one definitely conveys that active lifestyle we talked about. Yeah, yeah, it's good, but I still think you can do better. - Jessica? - Yes, Rob? The receptionist just called up. She said that your mother's in the lobby. - I thought she left town. - Guess not. - OK, would you tell them that I will be right down? - Yep. - What is it that you want? - All I want is enough money for that new car. Give me the money, and I'll be out of your hair forever. I promise. How much? Sixteen thousand. Are you...? I'm not giving you that kind of money. That's fine. I'll come back tomorrow and we can talk about it again, - after you've had some time to think about it. - No. I've never had a brand-new car, Jessica. Never. Just once in my life I'd like to know what it's like to drive something new. Fine. And this is it. Do you understand? One time. And you can never come back here again. Promise. OK, the money will be in your account this afternoon. Please leave. All right. So, with that, I would like to, um, pass it on to Mr. Vandover. First, let me say congratulations, Jessica, on a job well done. I know you're all interested in the hedge funds investments which will service a bridge gap until you can get Ezaprine on the market. Excuse me. Cameron, could I speak to you, please? Sure. Excuse me. After what I've heard today, I can tell you... - What's going on? - We have a big problem with Ezaprine. What? Come here. There seems to be a side effect that we didn't know about. What kind of side effect? - Death. - What are you talking about? Who died? One man who participated in the clinical trials, two others in the hospital, both on statins with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. But... h-how is that possible? Adecosine doesn't break down statins the way the bergamottin does. We've known that since the preliminary test. Yeah, well, the preliminary test may have produced a false positive. Oh, my god. Yeah. Well, I'd like to throw a bash to, uh, celebrate. I'd like to invite Mickelson employees, some of your colleagues, shareholders. Wonderful idea. Again, Jessica, congratulations. - Well done. - Thank you. You're wrong. All right? You're wrong, just like you were wrong before. Yeah, I knew you'd go there. Well, of course I'm gonna go there, because it's the exact same thing that you did with that anti-depressant, and this company lost millions of dollars retesting a drug on your advice, and we didn't even need to. That was a mistake. You know, I love you, buddy, but you're just overly cautious. I am telling you... I think this drug could be causing acute tubular necrosis in special populations. Ezaprine... is gonna save this company. It is all that we've got, and I'm not gonna hold it back based on one person's opinion. You can't be serious. What's gonna happen to this company when the lawsuits start pouring in? Changingnything right now means re-filing with the FDA, and I'm not gonna do that. What are you suggesting? We stand around and do nothing? A man is dead. Yeah, I realize that, but we don't know whether Ezaprine had anything to do with it, because there's no proof. Yeah, that's why I need a little time to do a follow-up. It's the ethical thing to do. Let me talk to Jessica about this, OK? And we can revisit this tomorrow. Is that OK with you? There's nothing to revisit, Cameron, and you know it. And by "exciting" I mean "boring", and by "fulfilling" I mean "hideous". Dad. I need to get some air. Yeah, it's on the second page at the top. - All right, buh-bye. - Hang up. - We got a huge problem. - What? Don Renfro was just in my office. He told me he thinks that Ezaprine could be killing people. - Hey, what's going on? - I chose this line of work because I wanted to make a difference... to save lives. Apparently, other people don't care about that. Other people? Who? Cameron? I'm sorry, honey. I shouldn't have said anything. I can't talk about it. I don't like seeing you freaked out like this. I-I'm fine. I'm just frustrated is all. You should go back inside and go to work. I don't want to see you get into trouble. Like I care about getting in trouble. Huh. But you obviously don't need any more stress, so... I'm gonna go in and be the best file clerk I can be. OK. And we are finding this out now why? Because someone whose husband kicked the bucket called him to find out if Ezaprine had anything to do with it. - Did it? - There's nothing conclusive, though it does appear that in special populations the drug could be causing acute tubular necrosis and death in certain cases. - You've got to be kidding me. - Oh, come on! Every drug in the world does that! We'll just slap a warning on it. No, that means we've got to resubmit the paperwork, and we've got to admit that we knew about the side effects. That's just gonna delay the process at the very least, and you know that. Mm... hm. OK, so, who else besides this Renfro knows about this? - No one. - You sure that he didn't tell anybody else? I'm positive. The guy does everything by the book. He wouldn't have told anyone. It was just a matter of time. I just want you to know that I'm still looking into your husband's death. Thank you, Dr. Renfro. I appreciate it. Gena, I will call you tomorrow with more information, OK? All right. Yes, Cameron. I just wanted to make sure you hadn't mentioned your concerns about Ezaprine to anyone. You haven't, right? Not yet. Good. It'd cause a panic. Yeah, well, I've only talked to you. Good, good. Well, listen, we'll get together with Jessica tomorrow and we'll figure out how we're going to handle this. See you then. Yeah, bye, good night. Thanks for the ride. So, Cameron has expressed your concerns, and I want you to know that we are taking this very seriously. Does that mean you're going to file an extension with the FDA? I need time to do a subsequent study. We are most definitely going to be allocating funds immediately to the study. Are you going to inform the FDA? Oh, yes. Absolutely. Thank you. I'd like to start by putting a research team together, start by requesting all the medical files of anyone who participated in the clinical trials. I think that's a terrific idea. Uh, Cameron and I will just need a couple of days. We need to redo the budget, make some decisions, so we can properly fund this. We want to make sure that this is done right. OK. All right, thank you, Doctor. You're welcome. What'd I tell you? This is a disaster. Yeah? Jessica, they're waiting for you in the conference room. Thank you. - We'll discuss this tonight. - Yeah. Wants to put a team together? Yeah, I told you Renfro was a problem. Could you stop what you're doing and help us focus here? You know what, if I don't get this money wired in this account tonight, Renfro... Renfro is the least of my worries. What are you talking about? I can give a shit without this spread. We can't let Renfro start blabbing to everyone that he knows that the Ezaprine is unsafe... especially because I'm not telling the FDA that we knew about the potential risks. If we do that, we might as well just throw in the towel, because the hedge fund money is gonna be long gone. - You understand that? - Can he be bought? No. We're gonna lose everything. If we don't figure out a way to stop him. 'Cause if we don't, Cameron, w-we're gonna kiss this all goodbye. And I'm not willing to do that. Are you? Let me just fire him. No, no, that'll make it worse. Cameron, we have to do... Huh. It's, um... it's a little bit more strategic. Good morning. Honey, you look tired. You have to stop staying up so late - and get some sleep. - I'm fine. Did you get everything worked out yesterday? This isn't something that can be fixed. It's damned if you do, damned if you don't. Let's eat. I can't do this. What do you mean, you can't do it? Of course you can do this. It's just like we talked about last night. Yeah, but what if someone asks where I was? I am going to be your alibi. You just valet park your car, you pick up a rental. If anybody asks, you and I were at dinner. I have done a lot of shady things in my life. I'm the first one to admit that. But I have never done anything like this. Cameron, why the sudden change? - Last night, you were completely on board. - Yeah, and what if I go to prison for the rest of my life? Yeah, and what if Mickelson closes down? You're gonna be out of a job. How are you gonna pay off all those bad bets? Unemployment. What are they gonna do to you? I mean, you're a man of odds. What are the odds that they're gonna let you live happily ever after? Cameron, I promise you, I am not gonna let you go to jail. Just follow the plan to a tee. You've got to trust me. I know what I'm doing. I know, I know, black isn't professional. No. But... they look OK. Wait, was... that a compliment? Am I in a parallel universe? You might be. Ugh! I can't believe I killed him. - The look on his face... - It's meaningless, trust me. Get it out of your head. Get it out of your head. I promise you, in a couple of weeks, when you are trading in all your stock options, you are not gonna feel a pang of guilt. Honey, relax, relax. Relax, I promise. OK? Hello! Mom? Hey, sorry, go ahead. I couldn't hear you. Sweetie, you need to come home right away. Why? What happened? Your father was robbed tonight at the bowling alley, and, uh... he... he didn't make it. I-I'll be right... I'll be right there. As I'm sure most of you know already, Mickelson Pharmaceuticals has lost a family member. Dr. Don Renfro was killed outside of a bowling alley. The police investigation is ongoing, but it appears to have been a robbery. Our hearts go out to his family, including his daughter, Renee, who you all know. She's been working here for about four months now. Let's take a moment of silence for Don, and reflect on how precious life is and how fleeting it can be. Want you to knowthat we've looked into it, and there's absolutely no connection between your husband's death and Ezaprine. Are you sure? One hundred percent. But we appreciate you bringing it to our attention, and if there's anything else we can do for you, please feel free to call me. All right. I'm here for you. He loved you a lot. I just feel like I let him down most of the time, you know? No, you didn't. He was so quiet the last few days. Something at work was bothering him. I just... I wish I knew what it was. Didn't... didn't you say there were rumors that the company might fold? Yeah. That was before Miss Perfect came along, the new executive VP. Apparently she's handling things. Well, it had nothing to do with you. I really... ...I really hope not. Hey. I wasn't doing anything, Officer. - How'd you know we were cops? We don't even have uniforms. - I could smell ya. - Can we talk to you for a minute? - What? We're investigating a robbery that happened at the parking lot back there. A guy was beaten to death about 10 days ago. Were you around? I didn't do it, if that's what you're asking. - Gimme a break. - Thought maybe - you saw something. - Nope, sorry. Listen, if there's a guy out here killing people, who's to say he's not gonna kill you too? Get him off the streets, it'll be safer for everyone. Look, I already told you I didn't see anything. She probably didn't see nothing. Let's go. Oh, nothing fancy. Maybe just a three-bed, three-bath. I'm not buying you a house, period. Don't make me say things I don't want to say, Jessica. Yeah, like what? Like maybe you owe it to me for having kept a certain secret all these years? You promised we were never gonna talk about that. Yeah, well, it's hard to feel good about that promise when I'm living in a dump and you're living in a hotel. Mother, you wouldn't do that to me. You don't think so? The only reason you've been able to run your little company and make your millions is because I never told anyone what you did to Albert. If I had, you wouldn't be where you are. God, do you know how much I hate you? Oh, don't start with how it was my fault for having shacked up with that guy. Albert was like a father to you. He hurt us. He put you in the hospital. Do you know how scared I was to be alone with him, while you were in the ICU? You didn't have to do what you did. It was him or us. He would have killed you or me. It was only a matter of time. Look, I don't want to talk about this anymore. I'll keep my mouth shut if you buy me the house. Send me the realtor information. Oh, I will, but you better put an offer in fast. Who's calling Dad's cell? Hello? Oh, hi. Um, I'm calling for Dr. Renfro. Did I get the wrong number? No. This is his daughter. Is he there? This is Gena Ferris. Um... no. He was killed in a robbery. Oh, my god. Um, I'm so sorry. Can I ask how you knew my dad? Of course. Um, my husband, Mike, participated in a drug study your father conducted last year. - What drug was that? - Ezaprine. W-Would it be, um, possible for me to talk to your husband? I'd just like to ask him a few question about that drug. He died unexpectedly a few weeks ago. That's, uh, that's why I contacted your father. I wanted to find out if maybe there was a connection. Um, listen, I'm-I'm actually just on my way to school right now, but... is there any way that we could maybe meet up later and talk? I-I'd just like to know more about what happened, if that's OK. Um, sure. Just tell me when and where. Hey. You OK? No, I'm not feeling very well. Would you please cancel the rest of my day? Uh, yeah, sure. Is there anything else - I can do for you? - No, thank you, - but I will call you later. - OK, sure. So, Cameron told you there was no connection at all between Ezaprine and your husband's death? Yes. This... this is my dad's file on Ezaprine. I went through it last night and saw what he wrote about Mike, but nowhere in there does it say they concluded that there was no connection. Everything my dad writes suggests otherwise. But so... you think that after your dad died, the company just decided to bury his concerns? I don't know. My dad was... ...my dad was pretty upset the last few days. I think this may have been why. You know what? I'm gonna talk to one of his coworkers about this. OK. Please, let me know what you find out. I definitely will. I promise. This lady Gena said Dad was checking into the side effects of Ezaprine. When he got into pharmaceuticals, he told me he wanted to save people's lives but other people didn't care. I think maybe that's what he was referring to. So, you think that your dad found out that this drug killed her husband? I don't know. What if it did? - I'm gonna talk to Sam. - Sam? Uh, he's one of the other researchers at Mickelson. Renee, look, I don't think you should get into this. Why not? I mean, if Ezaprine really is dangerous and no one knew about my dad? Even if that is the case, they're never gonna admit that to you. True, but... I don't know, I guess I just... need to get a sense of what was bothering him. It wasn't you. I know, but whatever it was, my dad thought it was important, and I feel like this Gena woman deserves an answer. Don did seem a little on edge the past couple of weeks. You thought so too, huh? Hey, did he mention a Mike Ferris to you, or any potential problems with Ezaprine? Not at all. Do you want me to talk to Cameron and find out? Would you? I'm sure everything's fine if they're moving forward with approval. But, sure, I'll ask. Thank you. Jessica? Oh! Goodbye, Mother. Thanks for coming down. I want to let you know that we're doing everything we can. Can I ask you a question? Why wouldn't the scumbag who robbed my father take his watch? It's expensive. A lot of reasons they didn't see it, they thought someone was coming, so they hurried off, maybe they didn't have any place to unload it and they just wanted cash. We'll keep you and your mom apprised of any new developments. Thank you. - Come on in. - Thank you. Here. Thank you. Hi, Caroline. I'm so sorry. I just wanted to bring these flowers by and, uh, just check up on the two of you. Thank you, Cameron. The flowers are beautiful. I'll just go put them in water. Um, before I forget, Renee, um, Sam... Sam came and talked to me, and he said that you were curious as to whether or not your father had any, uh, concerns regarding Ezaprine. Yes, that's right. Well... your dad was a very thorough man, and after going through all his data, I can tell you that there is no problem with the drug. Um... I-I talked to someone whose husband was involved in the clinical trials. - Gena Ferris? - Yes. Yeah, I talked to her as well. And with cooperation with the medical examiner, we immediately looked into the death of her husband, Michael Ferris, and I can tell you unequivocably... that Ezaprine had nothing to do with his death. Are you sure? Positive. It was just... it was just a very unfortunate passing. All right, look, if you ever need anything... from the company, from... anything... you call me, OK? OK. Thank you. - Jessica. - Yeah? Paul Winslow for you. Can I transfer him? Yes, please. Hello, Paul. So, do you have any good news? Yeah, uh, things are looking good. I should be able to get you an exact approval date by Friday. Thank you. We got it. I have never met anyone like you. And you never will. I think Cameron's lying. Why do you say that? My father had a file this thick of notes and papers that talked about the side effects in special populations. Suddenly they review it in two days and it's fine? Renee. I think Cameron wasn't listening to my dad about the dangers. That's why he said he was damned either way... tell the truth, save lives, and the company goes under; or say nothing and everyone keeps their jobs. OK, even if you're right, what are you gonna do? The FDA will eventually figure out that they've lied. Well, how many people are gonna die before then? I'm sorry. It's my mom. Hold on. - Hello? - Are you still at school? Hey, Mom. No, I'm... I'm just sitting here with Cat. What's up? Well, I just got a phone call from Quentin down at the bowling alley, and, um, your dad left a pair of bowling shoes there, and Quentin wanted to know - if we wanted to go and pick them up. - Yeah, no, of course. Um... you want me to come pick you up? Uh, no, no, I-I don't think I could go. No, it's, uh... it's OK. Um, I'll just... I'll do it by myself, OK? OK. Well, thank you, sweetie. I love you. I love you too, Mom. Bye. Hey. Can I... can I talk to you? Hi. Is this about that guy that got killed? Yeah. He was my father. I'm sorry. Um, this is... this is kind of a weird question, but you haven't heard anything about it, have you? The police already asked me that. I told them I didn't know anything. - OK. - I gotta go. OK, can y... Wait, hold... Really, I'm working here. How much for your time? What? I will pay you to talk to me. Forty bucks. Perfect. So... what do you think? I mean, you know this area. Do you think it was... two thugs, or a teenager? What's your best guess? No, it wasn't any of those. You want to know what I think? I think it wasn't somebody from around here. Why do you say that? Just a feeling. I mean, I could be wrong. Do you have... any other feelings? Um... ...could have been a man. Could have been an older man. Could have been driving a red car with out-of-state plates. What state? Jersey. D-Did you... did you see what he looks like? It was dark. Yeah, can I get another... It was late. And can I have a soda? Miss? - Yes. - He was white, short hair. Do you know what color his hair was? Um... d-did you have the time? Uh, it's... it's almost 930. I gotta go. Hey, is... is there any way that I could convince you to go to the cops with this? I have a boyfriend. He really wouldn't appreciate that very much. Look... ...I lost my father when I was about your age, and, um... I mean, he wasn't... he wasn't a doctor or anything like yours, but, uh... I really hope they catch the guy. Thank you. We should focus... Yes, hi, this is Jessica. - Celebrity endorsements. - In every region. Mm-hmm. So, we're taking a new approach, then. OK, thank you for letting me know. - Excuse me. - Yes, I will be there first thing in the morning. Are you all right? Who was that? That was the police. Apparently, my mom's boyfriend was out of town. He came home and found her dead. Oh, my god, Jessica, I'm so sorry. Let's get back to the media buzz. What? ...the time to be determined. Let's get back to the, uh... Maybe Gena Ferris was right. Maybe her husband did die because he took the drug. Yeah, but why would a huge company like Mickelson put out a drug if it was so dangerous? You don't know how it is. Ezaprine is, like, the life raft of that whole company. All of their patents are expiring. That's all anyone talks about there. So, you think your dad refused to keep his mouth shut? Possibly. There's just so many things that don't add up, Cat. Why would they take his wallet and not his watch? You know? And... and... and the timing... my dad has all of these questions about this wonder drug that everyone sees as Jesus in a bottle, and suddenly he's killed in a robbery. I know my dad. He would have just handed over his wallet. So, what are you gonna do? Hey, uh, are those - for Margaux? - Yep. I can take 'em to her when I go. Uh, I actually have to go see her anyway, so I can just take them. - Oh, OK. - Perfect. Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah. You know what? Let me call you back. Oh, we sent them the proposal last week. Hey, Renee, how are you doing? I didn't think I'd see you back at work so soon. Yeah, I just... I sorta needed a distraction. How's your mom? She's... not so good. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Um, actually, I wanted to ask you if you have a copy of the employee insurance benefits booklet? I know my dad had a copy somewhere, but we can't find it. Yeah, sure. We keep it with the new-hire stuff. I'll just go grab you one. - Thanks. - OK. I can't believe you stole a personnel file. - You can go to jail for that. - I doubt that. How are you gonna put it back? I'll just... slip it back into the wrong drawer she thinks it got misfiled. Easy. I was hoping there'd be a copy of Cameron's password in there, but I don't think there is. No, not in a personnel file. I mean, IT would have that. What do you want it for, anyway? If something was going on with Ezaprine, Cameron would know about it. I was gonna log in as Cameron from my dad's computer and see if I could find any incriminating emails. And then what? Go to the police and tell them you hacked into his computer? They'd arrest you. OK, so there's... there's no way to access his computer? Come on, you know about this stuff. Tell me. I mean, the best bet would be to go through his personal computer. That would be easiest to hack into with the password sniffer. And if he even accesses his emails remotely, you could read them. - How do you get a password sniffer? - Well, first you need a really cheap laptop. Then you have to transfer everything from your dad's laptop over to the new one. Then we install the password-sniffing software. It won't cost anything... it's open source. When anyone logs on to your dad's laptop, you will capture their keystrokes on your new one. None of this is illegal, because you're installing it on your own vice. Hi, Jessica. It's John Parker from the FDA. Yes, hello, John. I am sitting here with Mr. Mickelson and Cameron Finney. So, do you have some good news for us? I do. The paperwork went through. It's a done deal. I'll send you copies out tomorrow. - That's terrific! - Thank you so much, John. You have made our day. Thanks for the call. Sure thing. Congratulations, Ralph. We should announce it. We are gonna have a celebration. I know the perfect reception hall for it. Mr. Mickelson, Cameron's assistant just called up here to let him know that Renee Renfro is here. She wants to see you. I'll be right out. Excuse me. I feel so sorry for her and her mother. Me too, but Cameron's really good about handling these kinds of things. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I'm sorry to bother you, but I had to stop by and give Margaux the insurance forms anyway, so I thought maybe you guys could use this. A laptop? My dad's laptop. I just figured there might be something on here that would be useful for the company. You know, stuff he was working on, or whatever. Oh, um, absolutely. Thank you. No problem. Thank you again for the flowers. Oh, you're welcome. - See ya. - Yeah. This is good. What did she want? Oh, she wanted to bring us a gift... a little manna from heaven. She brought me Renfro's company laptop, in case there was anything we needed off of it. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. I told you that sympathy arrangement would work. So, is there anything on there that we need to deal with? Well, I'll certainly let you know. I can assure you it is completely taken care of. So we have nothing to worry about? It was all password protected. I deleted everything. Renee, check it out. What is it? The sniffer caught a second login. I think it's his personal email account. Holy crap. - Ha! Ha! - Wallace. - Cameron. - Ralph. Well, you're right on time. I just ordered a bottle of the best champagne in the house. - We have to celebrate. - Indeed. That's nice. Look at this. He rented a car? On the same day my dad was killed. I don't... I don't understand. What does that mean? The... the prostitute. The prostitute said... said she saw a red car with Jersey plates. Sometimes rental cars are licenced in neighboring states. Well, call them. Corsica Rent-A-Car. Hi. Uh, this is kind of a weird question, but... are any of your cars licenced in New Jersey? Yes, more than half. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, my god, Renee, what if you're right about all of this? What should I do? I-I think you need to call the police. To... prosperity. Oh, yes. And to Jessica. Absolutely. Cheers. So, I'll let Jessica give you all the good news. Jessica? Well, it is my privilege to announce that the FDA has approved Ezaprine. Woo! If he did rent a car and they had Jersey plates like the girl said, maybe he's the one who killed my father. And you think this has to do with the fact that your father was trying to block the approval of this drug, Ezee... Ezaprine, yes. And is prostitute you talked to, what did she look like? She won't talk to the police. Long blonde hair, full lips, very... built. - Too attractive to be a street walker? - Yes. I know who you're referring to, and you're right... she won't talk to us. C-Can you please just check in on us? Please? You have no other suspects right now... We will. Thank you. Hey. So, I have the emagazine on the line, d Wie and they want to do an interview with you. Tell them I'd be happy to grant them an interview. Yes, of course. - Talk to me. - Yeah, she was right. The car is here. - It's got Jersey plates. - Really? Yeah, I spoke to the rental agent. He rented it to him on the day Renfro was killed. Well, I think we're on to something. Hey, Perez! Hey. You find something? Yeah, I'm looking at the surveillance tape from Renfro's bank. You know how his statement said he pulled out 60 bucks from an ATM? - Yeah. - Well, he was followed by a red car matching the one you saw today. Nice. Bingo. What is this? This is my dress. For the gala. What do you think? Too much? I think you're gonna look beautiful. So, what time should I pick you up at the hotel? Oh, Ralph is gonna send a car for me, so I'll just see you at the reception. OK. Don't worry. You and I'll have our own little celebration after the party's done. Hey, listen, um... when's your mom's - funeral? - Oh, we're not having one. She didn't have any friends anyway. What the hell? Pull over. Put your hands on the wheel. OK. I don't know if we got enough to get him to confess. His lawyer's a real hard-ass. I'm gonna fib a little and tell him we have a witness that thinks he can ID him in a lineup. Cameron, we know you rented a car the day Renfro was killed. Now, we have surveillance tape of the car you rented following him after he made an ATM withdrawal. A witness at the scene could place the rental care there as well. Please, tell me we're not talking about the prostitute. We don't need her testimony. We know you killed Don Renfro because he was about to go public with the dangers of your company's hot new drug. We talked to the DA. Murder 1... death penalty. OK, Detectives, how do we get the death penalty off the table? Confession. And let's say it was a conspiracy. If my client were willing to give up his partner or partners, what would that be worth to you? We'd be willing to talk to the prosecutor about 25 to life, 2nd degree, with possibility of parole. You finally did it. Hm. Hey, hey! Jessica, you look beautiful. Oh, thank you. The woman of the hour. Congratulations. You're so sweet. Has anyone seen Cameron? Nope, but, uh, he should be here soon. Go to hell! I didn't do nothin'! - Now shut up. - Quiet, man, come on! I just wish that my mother could be here. I know that she would be so proud of our accomplishments Ezaprine. It is a drug that will change lives. Rarely does a drug come along that revolutionizes the health care industry, and Ezaprine does just that. When Mr. Mickelson called me and asked me if I would like to come and talk to him, well, I knew it was gonna be an opportunity that I couldn't pass up. Mickelson Pharmaceuticals cares about people, and that is what I wanted to be a part of. I wanted to be a part of that... I'm sorry, um, what is going on? - Jessica Slate, you're under arrest. - What? Conspiracy to commit murder, accessory to murder, felony obstruction - of a government agency. - What? For what? Murder? You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney, and to have that attorney present during questioning. - This isn't right. - Jessica, what's going on? Hey, what's going on here? Please, sit down, sir. This is outrageous. Come on, honey! We're gonna be late! How do I look? You look beautiful. Don't get TOO excited. I still have four more years of med school and three ars of residency. Your father would be so proud of you today. You think so? I know so. Come on, let's get you graduated. Ugh, I forgot to paint my nails. - In black? - No, actually, I was thinking of picking a color a little more... professional. Well, black would have been just fine. I guess it would match my cap and gown.
