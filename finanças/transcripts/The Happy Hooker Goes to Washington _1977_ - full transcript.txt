The Middle East men are meeting this weekend in Miami beach to confer starting a war that would be disastrous for the economy in the free world. This most militant of Arab leaders is Sheik Ollie. Sheik Ollie is the most eccentric known billionaire in the Middle East. He's also the absolute ruler of 28 million subjects whose average per capita income $49.11 a year before taxes. And his people hate him and where ever there is that kind of natural unrest, there is always the danger of Communist revolution. There's nothing we can do about that right now. We can't send in the marines. We can't have him assassinate and we can't have his telephone service screwed up by ITT. But what we can do is try to keep him away from that meeting and there's only one way to do that? ♪♪ [airplane noise] The president has been adamantly following the Senate sex hearings. And for reasons that I'm sure you understand, clinical reasons, he can't get involved overtly at this point, but I can tell you that he has been very impressed with your testimony and the president is convinced that you are the only person that can save America.
