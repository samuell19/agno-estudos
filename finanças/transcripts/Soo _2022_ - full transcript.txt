Toomas. Toomas. Toomas. Sõrru village, Tartu County, Province of Livonia, 1917 (In French) Johannes! Hello, brother! Toomas. I was speechless at first. Your message was forwarded here. If you had not left me directions I would have never found this path. Sure, sure, yes. Brother. Damn. What do you have here? Volatile times, yeah. At least it seems a good place to paint. Yes. Maybe you can do some other work needed here. I need some help with construction. Oh, no, no, no. Look at these hands. I need to protect them, they're not mine. They're borrowed from the muses. Liis. Hello, Liis. There's a room for you. There's a room for me. A room, yes. - I have a room in this swamp. A whole room! I had that done, yes. Who are you Tuks? Are you trained or a total mut? Aha, a purebred, yes? But something went a little wrong, yeah? Wait, Liis. It's unnecessary, Toomas. Okay then, Mrs. Haava. (In French) Thank you Liis. Gone. Gone like the wind. You learned that in Paris? Yes, this and a lot more. So our father's farm has been sold now? I guess you didn't choose the buyers carefully, did you? Well, I got a job offer here a year ago. At the swamp? - The manor. To build a mill. I thought that you... Wouldn't come back from Paris? It was a good offer. This place here... It was a good deal. So, and Liis? She's a good deal as well? I needed help at the farm. Liis was of a suitable age. You've got everything arranged nicely then? New farm, new job, wife of the right age. But children, where are the children? There's a lot of work. It'll be easier during the war without children. A good deal. I'm trying to be economical. Another mouth to feed in a time like this? Do you want to kick him out? Not that. If he'd help with the work, damn it... Liis! Liis! I'm going to the marsh looking for views. The evening is supposed to be nice in the marsh. Don't get lost in the marsh. I found my way here from across the world, I won't get lost here anymore. (In French) Mr. Swindler. Damn it. You keep stepping on me, damn it! Stand up yourself! Get on your feet, idiot! I'll drop you into the bog, you can drink there to the end of time, as much as you want. Why are you spying on me? Spying? You were there when I was swimming. You men think, that everything is yours to stare at and grab. Sorry, I don't usually harass girls. I'm an artist, I came to sketch. Toomas Haava. I got lost. May I ask what you're doing here? I live here. (In French) Aha, very interesting. Perhaps you can show me the way? Thank you. (In French) Thank you. Sorry. I didn't catch it before, what was your name? Why do you need to know my name? So I could thank you for the guidance. There's no need to thank me. Right. It's weird to thank everyone all the time. Helping someone, that should be natural. I'm actually here looking for nature, forest or people worth painting. Would you be okay with me painting you? Don't worry, I saw someone before, walking in the marsh. - Come! Come! My path goes here, you go that way. Go already, trouble is coming! Bastards! I want to eat. Where's the food? You sit here all day... When a man comes home from work... I didn't know, dear Jakup, if and when you'll come. Are you trying to starve me? Do you want me to die? You're throwing pieces of meat to the dogs, when I go out. But a man doesn't deserve any food. The food will be ready right away. Everything has been arranged at the church. Father has also given you his blessing, you can be bolder now. Jakup! What's a stranger doing here? I got lost. I'm from near Sõrru. Haava farm. I see. So the Sõrru gentlemen have come to the swamp? Yes. We're kind to strangers here. We'll show them which way to go. Sõrru is that way then? That way is the manor. Sõrru is that way. Aha. Thanks. - You're welcome. (In French) Thank you. I was worried, that you'd stay in the swamp all night. Would that have been so bad? One less mouth to feed. Breakfast is ready. Liis! Liis! I could still paint you. I'll take your painting to Paris and all can see the kind of muses here. I doubt I'll be much competition for them. I saw her last night at the swamp. A mythical creature. That would be Wildcat. Wildcat? - Hilda. Wildcat, interesting name. You be careful with her, she has multiple admirers. One of them is pretty dangerous. Big and simple. Simple... They say that he drowned the old lord of the manor in the swamp. (In French) Good morning, brother! I said "good morning" to you. Good morning. Let's go to the village. I'll show you what's where. The area by the pub and station? Yes and the mill construction. That's the only work we have during the war. Right, come hell or high water, you'll find a dry piece of land to plow. I'm building the mill for the manor. It's a big undertaking, not some fantasy. Your mill, sounds like an intrigue. Even the Eiffel Tower pales in comparison. (In French) Here is my porridge à la carte. (In French) I don't think so. It's no Paris here. First we'll go to the manor. The baroness is expecting you. Well, well. You want to show me off, dear brother. I mentioned that you were coming. The baroness was interested. She was widowed recently, she must need some entertainment. Brother, I'm a serious artist, not a fool. But I don't mind wealthy widows anyway. She just wants to know about Paris. The baroness is a lady. Quite a few things scraped together here. (In French) Unbelievable! (In French) Hello ma'am, hello sir. Good day, Toomas. Good day, dear... Mrs. Lilit Martinson-Lilienfeld. What a name. What a pleasure. An honor meeting people of the world here. Oh you... I'm just a simple Estonian. But for the last five or even six years, I have really been in Paris. Modesty. Imagine, I'm trying to live in this swamp as if it were Paris. Perhaps Mr. Toomas will help us make things more authentic with good advice. I don't know, I already started collecting swamp shoes to get used to the marsh life. Be careful. The swamp life might get to you. There's all sorts of fumes here. Brother Johannes has surely bored you to death with his mill talk. Let's go talk purely about art. Alright, but even art depends on mills. Charming! Oh, it is beautiful here. Of course I'm sad, when poor children can't eat. But we helped to collect... things and food here. That's very nice of you. - Yes. War! And what's going on in Petrograd is unheard of. Temporary government? It's unfortunately certain that the world is changing. It's so nice that you understand. Has the art scene been paralyzed as well? Well, actually many things happening in art are quite revolutionary. Mr. Matisse, Picasso... Awful revolutionaries. Especially that Lenin. But fortunately our backs are guarded as we're loyal to the czar. You're not worried about a German invasion? Toomas, I'm not afraid of any invasions. Some think I'm the invader here. Vassily, the dessert table! Tell me, what's fashionable in Paris now. Your brother won't even tell me about Sõrru. Well, fashionable in Paris... soup kitchen lines and rags. I wish they would do even worse there, so we could catch up faster. Toomas, what are you looking for here? Let's say that... (In French) Inspiration? Very good! In that case, I'm ordering a portait. You'll paint a big equestrian portrait. On a white horse! Like Empress Catherine! I can't let you sit in that swamp. You belong in a studio. In your service, gladly. Oh, how good. Long live art! Are you sure about the baroness' portrait? Why not? You're afraid I'll make more with it, than you will with your mill? No, not that. It seems like a big undertaking. Don't you worry about my skills. Where to now? I felt like having a drink. We were supposed to go to the mill. The war is taking away all the workers. It's all about work and work and work. Tell me, when was the baroness widowed? What happened to the baron? They say all sorts of things. Those stories are idle chatter. The old baron was studying marsh plants. Probably fell into a bog. No one pushed him into it. The baroness isn't to blame. Well, well. The baroness isn't just a lady, but a femme fatale. Give me two. I don't know, congratulations, there's a wedding coming, yeah? Innkeeper, give the men a round for the engagement! I'm not stingy. Congratulations Jakup, you're getting a good man for your cat. Mr. Artist. I suppose congratulations are in order. War has left some sour berries unpicked. Good morning. The food isn't as fancy as you're used to. Ah no, in Paris you sometimes had to work to get anything at all to eat. Was it worth going there if it was so bad? Tell me, what's going on at the Soo farm? That Wildcat... Seems like she has trouble with the groom. Why do you care? I'm right then, yeah? Wildcat's drunken father promised to marry her to Madjak. That's all there is to it. How can he do that against her will? How do I know, what that girl wants or what goes against her will? Wait, Liis... I'm just looking for a painting subject. You promised to paint the baroness. You've got a great subject there. Liis... I think you're a little jealous? I promised to paint you as well. I don't have time to be jealous, I have to go to the market. Wait! Marta, don't skimp, damn it! Greetings, what can I offer you? Hello. - Hello. Please try some fresh smoked meat! Oh, no thanks. Very good meat. - Is it? What's your name? Maie. - Oh, very nice, Maie. Here, look at this! Gone. Disappeared. How much is this? - Only a few copecks. Here you go. - Thank you so much. Well hello, hello. Nice view. Stop! Who are you? - Jannu. Why are you spying on me? Me? You, you. You were at the swamp house too, no? Or were you spying on the girl instead? I don't spy. I am Wildcat's... Boyfriend? - Mhm. You're the one who isn't dangerous then? I love Hilda. What Madjak does isn't right. If you love the girl, intervene. Madjak... - Yes? (In French) God help us! You love her, but let her be taken away? You have to fight for love. If that's the story, I'll go marry her. Tere, proua. Good day, nice that I caught you here. Likewise. I would like to ask you, Mr. Toomas, to come to the manor for an audience. We'll organize for you a nice reception during the harvest party. A great honor. And to discuss the portrait further. Yes, my thoughts exactly. I already ordered the fabric from Tartu. Four cubits? - Six. The more the better. And the horse costume is being picked. Horse costume? Of course. We talked about it. It'll be an equestrian portrait. Ah, of course, so be it. I'll turn the manor into a Parisian studio. You'll feel more at home there. (In French) Excellent. Have a nice day! You don't have to hide the thread. I can help you fix your shirt, if you want. You're busy enough with Johannes. And you with Wildcat and the baroness. Yes, exactly. Can you let me off near that road? Toomas. I have to go. Don't get involved. Toomas, it's just your vanity. Vanity? You only think, you know nothing about me. Hilda! Are you lost again? Sorry, but it seems like, you are in need of guidance instead. Guidance? Hilda, I can see that things aren't okay. You need protection. Hilda. I need to know more about everything. I can maybe think of something then. Hilda! Come here! Into the boat? - Come on! Come! Hurry! Why can't we just talk to Madjak? He'll shoot you, when he's like this. Hilda! Hilda! He threatened to kill you too. Me? - When you were at the house. I told him that you promised to protect me. That you know what's going on and how to deal with people like him. Was I wrong? No, no you weren't. Thank you, Toomas... He seemed quite polite. Don't believe his politeness. He's clever. Perhaps you're afraid of him too? Everyone is. No one is up for it. All men are cowardly. I have to think about what to do. I know what to do. Madjak must die. Hilda! Kill him! Toomas, kill... - Hilda. A human life isn't a candle, that you can just blow out recklessly. because it is written... I don't care about what's written. Kill him, Toomas. I'll think of something, I promise. What's going to happen to you now? Maybe he won't hit me before the wedding, if I agree to it in his eyes. But this wedding isn't happening anyway. Your delicate hands are needed now. Come, push the block underneath. Use your hands. Brother, tell me what kind of man that Madjak is. Madjak is the baroness' stableman. Why do you care about him? He's harassing the swamp house people. That thing isn't right. Another family's business isn't our concern. A girl is in danger, she needs protection. Since when do you care about others? Now you're a big protector. Okay, I'll go myself then and talk to the baroness about her stableman. At least she listens to me. No, you're not going to cause trouble. My work is already hard enough. And then you come with your games. Hard with your work? A great injustice is right before you. Johannes, you're like a horse with blinders. Tell me what are you working for. You shut up, damn it. You've always evaded work. Yes, I have been evading work. Man comes from Paris, dances around, screws everything up and then goes back to his easy living. Is that right? I'm not coming from Paris. Liis. Liis. You could smile a little for the portrait. You're out looking for smiles in the marsh. That woman needs help. What about me? Do I not need help? Or Johannes? Or maybe you're the one needing help? We all need help. And you'll help? You're running from one woman to the next. You're only painting me, to get practice for the baroness' picture. Liis. - What else do you gain from it? I don't need to gain anything. Want me to cancel the baroness' painting? Just like that, gone. An equestrian portrait isn't my thing. It's very difficult to depict a horse. Thrashes with it's head and tail. Why did you come, really? You need to get ready. It's not proper to be late to the manor. Let's continue tomorrow, you can stretch. Be what may, but try to be respectful. I live by the heart, not by the strength of my back. I'll say it straight, Toomas. If the mill job disappears, then everything has been pointless. Selling father's farm, being here with Liis. Maybe you'd like to paint that portrait? It's a party. I want my bride. First the wedding. Then the girl. So be it. Hilda! Hilda! (In French) Hello, Miss (In French) Hello, Toomas. (In French) Let's start the party! (In French) Perfect. The canvas has arrived from Tartu. We can start working right away. Very nice, but there's this thing with it... A thing with it? - Yes. Vassily, champagne! A thing? Yes, so before we start... Then I'd like to... Or is our Toomas interested in Wildcat now? That dirty swamp girl. Actually I wanted to talk about her. Although from a different angle. - Toomas. Tell me rather, is everything here correct? Paris pales in comparison. Flatterer! Watch where you're going, blind fool! Now I have to change my outfit! Sorry! Shut up, you damn animal! The old baron's family ruled here for generations. Slaves cleared and drained the swamp. They hunted. Why did the old baron's ancestors come to this swampy land? There must have been better places then. A slave does things the easy way. A noble sees a challenge in difficulty. You've been here for so long, you consider yourself a noble. I've lived here for 50 years. The exact same life as the baron. I keep the consistency here. Consistency? Okay. This lady of low birth came here a year before the baron died. She was only after the fortune. - Mhm. There's even rumors, that she got your noble baron killed. Noble? Your slave people don't get what "noble" is. You're afraid to live as much as you are afraid to die. And then you need a party, yes? I... am not afraid to die. You talk about Paris. You were suffering in the gutters there, but all of a sudden you're an artist now. How dare you! You're patching your fool's costume here. Clowns like you. Where did you steal the suit from? How dare you? Go back to Paris and take this goose with you. There you are, Mr. Artist. Let's go that way. What do you think? Is it big enough? Can you fit the horse, or should I order a bigger one? No, this one is good. I've chosen the horse. It'll be my Ashvan, but I wasn't sure about my own outfit. I would like your help. You're still the artist and I'm just the material in your hands. Go, go! Which of these would fulfill it's purpose? They're all very pretty. Or this? This dress? This one too. - I know! But what if I was naked on the horse? Wouldn't that be both bold and regal? Naked? Yes. I have nothing to be ashamed of. My skin is more regal than any dress. I don't... Dear Mr. Artist, would you be so kind and paint a nude equestrian portrait of me? Don't be so tense. Relax. A French studio must always have space for a little opium. Don't you think? I mean... I wanted to talk about your stableman. Madjak. Before we get started with the work... Drink. It relaxes. Can you feel it? Artists use things like these. I wanted to tell you... Wait. Try to enjoy it a little bit. We can start working right away. Today we get acquainted with the material. We need to prime first. Of course you know what to do, Mr. Artist. Prime, paint. Love me, Toomas. What a brute! What's bothering you? Talk to me, talk to me! Talk to me! You're not leaving like this! You hear me? Come back! You'll regret it, if you leave now! Brunot. Leave me alone. Mr. Artist. Came to teach us dumb people. You don't know how things work here. Leave the girl alone. Or else? Hilda. Kill him, Toomas. You were passed out by the road. That monster is going to remove her soul. And he'll make Jakup drink himself to death. Madjak went to the pub with father. They won't be back until the sun is high. And when they do, then... The wedding is on Sunday. He's arranged everything at the church. I promised to help. No one can help us, Toomas. I can. Madjak is stronger than everyone. You talk about what is written, but he's just going to laugh at that. No, no. I have to do something. I can't do this anymore. Toomas. Hilda. I'll think of something. I have to get you out of here. To home! Thanks. This won't end until the girl is in the bog. Or Madjak disappears himself. Then Madjak should disappear. Oh, silky fingers. Fools artist. Mr. Artist. You're going to let the girl go and get out of that hut. Has the gentleman gone crazy? Stop! Shoot. - Stop! Shoot. You wanted to kill me? Now I have the right to end your life. Oh God, what did I do? What did I do? You did everything right. What's going to happen to Hilda now? Don't worry. He's going to the pub to lick his wounds. Toomas! Toomas! - Hilda! Toomas, are you okay? - Yes. You're so brave, thank you! Jannu! Jannu! What do we do now? Talk to me, what will we do now? You have to get out of the swamp house. It's dangerous there. Come to Sõrru, I'll talk to Liis. I'll talk. Calm down. Damn shepherd boy, I'll kill him. And I don't need that damn girl anyway. That artist can have her if he wants. What are you talking about? The girl has been promised to you. She doesn't want me, she can go to hell. That's not right. I don't have to ask anyone. You're no man at all, Madjak. You've gone soft. What do I do with a stableman like that? This girl has betrayed you and laughed at you in front of the world. She deserves a harsh punishment. The harshest. Pull yourself together, Madjak! I'm telling you, that man is out to kill. Hilda has to come here with her mother. At least until the situation is resolved. You have to talk to Johannes about this. But he goes straight from the mill to the pub now, not home. Liis, you understand that we must help. Can you help me talk to Johannes? You're fooling yourself Toomas, you don't want to help her, you want her. No, no, it's not like that. It's not like that. You went away. Liis. But I came back. Maybe I came back for you. Stop it. - Liis. Going was a mistake. Liis. - We can't, we can't. Toomas, Toomas, I want a child. I want a child. You're not coming straight from Paris then? At first I wanted to stay there. I even got myself the papers. My friend Brunot helped. But then they sent us to the frontlines. I was sitting in a bomb hole there. And then there was a gas attack. My friend Brunot had been wounded. The gas came so fast... I could hear him screaming. Am I a coward? In war... People act against their nature there. It's not the place for an artist. Perhaps it is so. Or maybe it's the one place where you can see inside yourself. You see everything sitting in that crater. Who you are and who you're not. Johannes, Johannes! Out of my way! - Listen to me, Johannes! Damn it! You come to my break my home like this! Break what? What do I have to break here? You lick boots at the manor and sleep here. Don't you tell me that, bastard. Traitor! - I'm the traitor? You sold my home. You didn't think I'd come back. You were hoping I was dead! Admit it, damn it! Since our parents died, I've been their replacement for you. You ungrateful pup. You've always thought of yourself. Always. I had to leave, so you could think more about yourself. You're a tramp! Yes, a tramp! I couldn't change your ways. You don't know who I am. You're cowardly! Weak, yes, weak! You're an animal for sale. An animal for sale, that's what you are. You're a slave! Yes, yes, I am. I am a slave. And for what? Damn it. I'm a broken clock. I've painted myself into a corner here. Johannes. Johannes! That Toomas is fake through and through. Honestly, Hilda. I couldn't help it, when I saw it, I took a rock and... He's cunning, he plays with all the women. Go away Jannu, you'll get hurt. No one is waiting for you at that farm. You're lying. Well then father-in-law. It's time for bloodletting. I'll do this massacre with your blessing. The wedding is on Sunday. They're going to take my dear daughter away. Here, go light a candle in the church. Everything will sort itself, if I leave. I'm ruining the natural balance of things. If anything will get balanced here at all. Johannes... He'll forgive you. But me? Can I forgive myself? Liis. Okay, okay. I'll talk to Johannes. - No need. He knows. He knows who you are. Who I am and who he is. There's nothing to do about that. Yes. Toomas! Toomas! Hilda is in trouble! She ran to the swamp. Madjak came to kill her. Damn it! Jannu! What are you doing? You said that you have to fight for love. I'm fighting now! I'm glad you understand that now, but you're fighting the wrong man. Don't come! Don't come! Wildcat may die because of you. You're lying! - I'm not lying. Don't come! Don't come! Jannu, stop it! Hilda! It hurts! Calm down! Hilda! Hilda! Hilda! Mr. Artist. - Where is Hilda? You rat! Where is Wildcat? You rat, I should've killed you immediately. What did you do to her? Die, you bastard! Die! Die! Die! Help! Help! Help! Toomas, please! Help me! Toomas! Toomas! Toomas! Toomas! Toomas! Toomas! Wildcat will go to her relatives in Elva with Jannu and her mother. The swamp isn't right for a young girl. There's a school in Elva as well. And you? Are you sure? Yes, going to Tartu. I'll see what Konrad Mägi thinks of my art. Maybe I'll get lucky. I'll start again. Toomas. I'm a country woman. Stop, you're an endless secret. And you're an infinite child. I can use farm money to help your studies. Thank you. We'll see what happens. There's a revolution in Russia. - Yes. The Germans are near Riga already. I guess they need a mill as well. What do you have here?
