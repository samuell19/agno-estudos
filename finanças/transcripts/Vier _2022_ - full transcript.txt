- Hi, Ulli. - Hi. Take care. - Hi, Ulli. - Hi. THE CURSE St. Polten's inspector is on her way. - Go and put something on. - Yes. I'll take you in. See you later. Watch out for her. She disciplined me once. I know her from my last job. Before St. Polten took her. Everyone respected her a lot. Come in, Ulli. Thanks. You're welcome. Take a seat. HP says you're from around here? Yes, I grew up here. Do you know the new owner? No. I've seen him once or twice. He still hasn't moved in. He bought the property from the bank two years ago. Before that, the house was empty for almost 11... 11 years. They started renovating it in spring. - Ulli knew the Trummlers. - Mm-hm. Dr Ludwig is here. - Right, let him in. - Come in. - Hello, Doctor. - Hello. There was a lot of traffic leaving Vienna. These are the remains... of three infants. Probably newborns and buried after their death. We don't know the exact timeline, but we think this was about ten, 15 years ago. General medicine is not that glamorous, but at least I never see things like this. So, just to cover all bases, did you happen to notice anything out of the ordinary down in the cellar? No, but I only went down there during the first visit. Of course, we're planning to do something with it in the long term. I'm not even sure I still want to live there. Every old house has had a body lying in it. Yes, but three children? What do you know about the previous owners? Just rumours. That won't help. What did you hear? Well... That their child disappeared and was never found. That the marriage fell apart because of that. The husband hanged himself, the wife moved out years ago. The estate agent told me this, and someone else told him. I'm sure it can easily be verified. Out of curiosity, were there any omens that swayed you to purchase this house? I'm not superstitious. When are you planning to move in? Next week. And I want to open my clinic in mid-October. Do you have a family? No. Claudia Trummler, born on February 24, 1989. She was reported missing on May 13, 1999. On the morning of the 12th, she left her parents' house to go to school as usual, but never arrived. And why did they report her missing a day later? I... I don't know. - She could've been with a friend. - Was she your friend? You must've been the same age. She went to the same school, but in a different parallel class. But we weren't friends. She was a lone wolf. She always went straight home after school. Aha. So the parents allowed 24 hours to pass before they reported their child missing, on the grounds that she might've been with a friend. Yet you're saying she didn't have any friends and always went straight home after school. I'm very much in favour of more female officers, but if you want to do more in this job than getting coffee, you need to make more of an effort. Twice as much as your colleague. It's true. I'll be here again at 8:30am tomorrow. I need you to be present for all the interrogations and provide me with information on every individual in this vicinity. Goodbye. Goodbye. Well? Make an effort. To contain the water masses. On Tuesday the team in Traun cleared out basements and streets. There is reluctance to call this yet another flood. Memories of the flooding in the summer of 2002 are still too fresh, when the flood damage cost millions... - They didn't mention the bodies. - Are you crazy? That would be so bad. Affected by strong rainfall in Wachau and the Kampf valley and provide support. The flood relief fund will cover up to 1000 euros... It was the saddest thing I'd ever seen. Yeah, I know. Can you feel it already? No, it's still too early. I ordered a book of Scandinavian first names. Okay... I know. As big as a cherry pit, not even worth giving it a name. I just had a shitty day. Well, well. What an important visitor. Morning. Mum called me yesterday. Awful story. Any news? I'm not allowed to say anything. But you're allowed to have a coffee? No, thanks. Okay. I wanted to ask you something, Sonya. Go on. You were friends with Claudia, right? Are you kidding me? - No one was friends with her. - Yes, but... I know she came to a birthday party of yours. Mum forced me to invite her. To be honest, it wasn't fair. I mean, she was nice. But she never let anyone close to her. Do you want to sit down? I'll give you a cream cake, you sweetie. - Yes. - Another coffee, Mr Gruber? Ask me again in ten, 15 minutes. My blood pressure'll be down again. You're right. I'm sitting down now anyway. You remember how we snogged around? We? Are you crazy? I mean, at the age of ten, 11. With our friends. I'm sure you did it too. Just fooling around. With a lot of giggling and stuff. Anyway, I tried that with Claudia. After that she avoided me. She was really afraid. A lot of kids were afraid of you. That's true. I wanted to ask you about her parents. Did you know them? Well, I mean...? Did you ever go to her home? Just twice. I just told you about the second time. Yes, she came from a strict household. Her mum was very weird. On the one hand, she wanted to know everything, and was always worried about Claudia. She was exempt from PE class because of her asthma. On the other hand, she wasn't very nice to her. It was like she was protecting her even though she didn't like her. You know what I mean? - Hi. - Hi. The rumours alone. When you hear what people say... - You're right there, yes. - The whole time. - The whole time. You can't imagine. - Mum? Oh, sweetie. I was on my way to the hairdresser's and thought I'd drop by for a coffee. You've never done that before. - Morning, Chief Inspector. - Morning. - I thought I might be able to help. - Mum... Your mother knows everyone in Krumau. And their family tree. - That's not hard. - It's about the details. Looking behind the fa√ßade. I've learned that in every rumour, in every single one, there is always some truth. We can't work with rumours though. Wrong. Rumours can tell a lot. Like the social hierarchies in a village. - That's what I mean. - Yeah. Okay. It was a pleasure. - Same here. - Yes. And now I know that this terrible story is in the best hands. Not a lot of investigation needs to be done, but still. What do you mean by that, Ms Seidl? - Mrs Trummel was... - Trummler, Mum. Yes, okay. Mrs Trummler was a very bad person. She was a mother without feelings. And she often acted like she didn't know you. In Krumau. Was she arrogant? Stupid? I can't say. The only person she spoke to was that teacher... What was his name... - Mr Deisenberger. - What? - Deisenberger, Mum. - Deisenberger. Right? And she was very religious. In a stubborn, old-fashioned way. So she wouldn't have aborted a child. Mum, that's worse than a rumour. That's a penny dreadful. Please. I'll call you later. - Go and find out where Mrs Trummler is. - No one knows. And that's so creepy. Your daughter is trained to find out something like this very quickly. Be strict with her. She needs that. Take the second exit at the roundabout. The first one. - Just go around again. - But she said... If you turn right, it's shorter. Please turn around at the next opportunity. Please turn around at the next opportunity. Right. Now I'm relying on you. That's no use. It's broken. - Hello. - Hello. May we come in? Take a seat. - Can I offer you anything? - No, thank you. You'll have some juice, right, Ulli? No, I'm fine. - Come on, Ulli... - Thanks for your time. Mr Deisenberger. I'll get straight to the point. As you wish. You were Claudia Trummler's primary school teacher for four years, and so you might know something. Sure. The children always liked me. Ulli was a very hard-working girl, but I think Claudia worked even harder, huh? You no longer work as a teacher? What happened to me would be called mobbing today. It's a while ago now though. I'm not complaining. I'm not angry. You also knew the Trummler family for many years. And apparently, after Mr Trummler's death, you looked after Ms Trummler a bit? My late wife looked after her. Marlene was a poor soul. And after all that happened, she was very confused. Sometimes she suddenly stood in our house. It's very nice... to see you again after all this time. - You built a house, right? - Yes. - It's not ready yet. - Yes, that takes time. Mr Deisenberger. How and... why did Mrs Trummler leave Krumau in 2005? Well... She'd inherited a run-down house and a whole pile of debt. And besides me and my wife no one spoke to her anymore. Bad luck followed her everywhere... I don't wish that on anyone. First her daughter disappeared, then her husband died. She found him. Do you think Mrs Trummler was also suicidal? You can't look inside anyone. We'd like to know where Mrs Trummler is now. She never changed her address. And there is no corpse record. - Did you continue having contact? - No. Did she say goodbye to you? Not to me. No. She had more contact with Barbara in the end. Did you never wonder whether something happened to her? She left in her car. To me it looked like she moved out. The bank tried to find her. But then the house covered her debt. Did Mrs Trummler ever get pregnant again? - Barbara might've known that. - Visibly pregnant, I mean. Did you notice anything? She was naturally a bit chubby. There's no point. It's not even two minutes on foot. "You can't look inside anyone." An eternal problem. Well... If you could, we wouldn't be needed. - Where is your gynaecologist? - Why? Where would you go to if you needed a gynaecologist here? - To Gars. - Is there more than one? There's only Doctor Sburny. How old? When did he open his practice? No idea. Maybe in his mid-50s. He's been around for ages. So he probably treated Mrs Trummler. You could assume so, yes. We'll go there later. What are you doing there the whole time? I'm looking on Instagram for Claudia Trummler. Your generation is a funny bunch. You can find anyone on social media. A girl who was kidnapped posts holiday photos online under her own name 14 years later? I think that's unlikely. I don't think she was kidnapped. The investigation back then went on for a long time. When a child... cannot be found at all... has disappeared without a trace, as if the earth had swallowed her up, then unfortunately you can assume... that the earth really swallowed her up. - Hi. - Hi, Ulli. I heard you went to see Deisi. Gossip travels fast here. I have my informants. Did you still have Deisi at school? Sure. He left... about ten years ago. Tamara was in year four back then. Oh, listen. I'll write Tamara. She's on her way here anyway. She can talk to you. Hey, I think your boss needs you. She's not my boss. - May I? - Sure. - Here you go. - That's fine, thanks. I wrote Tamara already. Great. - Who's Tamara? - His little sister. She was in Deisi's class. In Deisenberger's. When he retired early. Mm-hm. The autopsy report came in. The children were born about one year apart. So it was one pregnancy after another. All the same mother, but not all the same father. They're in the lowest size and weight category. No physical abnormalities. Two girls, one boy. She probably bore them without any help and they were suffocated soon after. The boy was last. I have to make a quick call. Do you remember me? I'm Yannick's sister. Of course. You've grown. My brother said... you want to know about Deisi. What do you know about him? I know why he had to leave. Why? He groped me during project week. Just briefly. He didn't rape me or anything. He just lifted me up in a game and grabbed my bum tightly. I thought it was funny for a moment. He was so big and strong, not like my dad. I wasn't the only one. Someone said something and then he was gone. I just know it because she told us one night when she was drunk. Are you coming, Tamara? I'm sure we weren't the first. If I'm not allowed to use the sat nav, you have to help me. - Is something wrong? - I just feel a bit nauseous. That's normal after the first murder. But you need to get used to it. Left in the Spitalgasse. Then it's the white house on the right side. I had two miscarriages. Dr Sburny said it will keep happening and that I can't have kids, but... that's not true. I go to a female gynaecologist in Krems now, so I don't really like seeing him. I rarely like questioning someone, but "like"... is not a category at the police. - Good afternoon. - Afternoon. - May I help? - Lower Austrian State Police. Could I speak shortly to Dr Sburny? Yes, of course. - I'll let him know. - Hi, Ulli. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hi. - I heard you built a house. - Are you expecting? - Hello. Please excuse us. Mrs Herzog is here on duty with me. No private conversations, please. You're assuming they were her children? Everything points to this. Even if we haven't done a DNA analysis yet. We can't until we locate Mrs Trummler. I never carried out a vaginal examination on Mrs Trummler. Uh-huh? - But she was your patient. - She came here, yes. But she was, and probably still is, a very religious woman. So she wouldn't let herself be examined by a man. That must be accepted. I suggested that she... goes to a female colleague in the area, but she looked at me as if I'd suggested a threesome or something. Excuse me. She simply didn't want that. So why did she come to you at all? I'm an orthodox medical practitioner. But my scope is a little broader than usual. I did various extra trainings and seminars on alternative medicine, psychology, TCM. I even completed a seminar on shamanism. I believe Mrs Trummler was simply looking for a confidant. And what did she want to talk to you about? You'd have to differentiate between the time before and after the loss of her daughter. Before that... her visits were generally short. I could feel she wanted to talk. But she didn't really have the courage to. I always had the feeling she wanted to get something major off her chest. But I never pushed her. Not in any way. And after the... "loss of her daughter", as you call it? She wanted to have another child. At all costs. I couldn't do much. I referred her for a hemogram. We tested her hormone levels. She was fertile, I told her how to keep track of her ovulation. Then shortly after, she had a positive urinal test. She was very happy. And never came back. This was... Hang on, I have it here. There we go. March 2002. I'd be happy to give you Mrs Trummler's file, but it won't tell you much. Like I said, I was only allowed to shake her hand. Thank you. Did she ever say anything about her husband? Well... Their marriage was not a happy one, I think. She never talked about him. But on her first visit she filled out the form for new patients. You know it. And she wrote down "Engelmayer" as her surname. Her health insurance company got in touch, because her insurance number didn't match her name. And guess what? That was her maiden name. Thank you very much. A colleague of mine will be in touch. Yes, you too. Goodbye. Marlene Engelmayer lives in the Beulegasse in Vienna Brigittenau in an assisted living facility. But right now she's an inpatient at the social medical centre in Floridsdorf. That's her eighth time as an inpatient on a psychiatric ward. The doctor treating her is Dr Helene Rasnic. - Rasic... - Rasic, yes. She's expecting your call. Do you need a print-out? No, I have one. Let's drive there. Herzog? Or are you feeling nauseous again? Don't tell me you're pregnant, please. Yes, it doesn't look nice, but it's not so bad. She's been lightly sedated, which was necessary, but we'll take off her restraints in a few hours, and then she'll be sitting at the dinner table like nothing happened. Right. - Shall we get a coffee? - Gladly. Can I ask when you think we'll be able to question her? We'll have to see how her progress is. Then I'll be in touch at the end of the week, okay? Are you her daughter? No. Does she talk about her daughter? It's really important to know. She's scared of her. That she'll find her. But I don't think her daughter's looking for her. She probably doesn't want anything to do with her. - You smoke? - I've quit eight times already. Now you're starting again with this one? Yes. I'll just smoke the one. And will tell myself it's just one. Then I might have none tomorrow, and two the day after. - And so on. - Is it because of me? What a lass you are. I get the feeling I just annoy you. Yes, you do annoy me a bit. Because you don't want to take a misstep. You're not stupid. Believe in yourself. You're smoking in the car? It's annoying that you keep asking questions with obvious answers. You can let me out after the bend at the bus stop. We can question her tomorrow morning. - But you don't need to be there. - Why not? I think we can expect quite a story. Yes. So? You're thinking of Claudia Trummler? Sure. I can see all the open ends in the case. - Claudia is not the case. - But she's part of it. Claudia was already gone when her mother probably bore and suffocated three kids. Whether Claudia was imprisoned or killed, or... started a new life under a new name on the Bahamas is irrelevant to us. I disagree. Well, well. Resistance. I would've driven you home. No, it's okay. Thanks. - Good evening. - Hi. Have you found out anything? - I'm not allowed to say. - Oh, right. Of course. Sorry. I'm Matthias, by the way. Ulli. Herzog. I'm Dr Ludwig's partner. Oh, right. Women always react like this when they hear he's taken. No, you got it wrong. I'm married. That's not necessarily a contradiction. I thought people were on first name terms here. True. Then let's do the same, okay? Okay. Sure. Have a good evening. Bye. What? He's gay? Then good luck to him in Krumau. Everyone was happy we were getting our own doctor. - He doesn't look gay. - Oh, come on. When did you ever meet a gay man in real life? I think Klemens is gay. Yeah, right. You're friends with Sigrid. Yes, and I'm sure she knows. They just decided they'd act like he's straight. No... Today felt like three days. She'll call me now. There you go. Yes. Hello, Mum. Sweetie, I found something you might want to see. It's been a long day, okay? I'll call you tomorrow. I still have to find the old video tape recorder. What are you talking about? I found an old video tape of the school choir. Remember? You're on it, and Sigrid, and Sonya. And also Claudia Trummler. She had such a beautiful singing voice. Mum... Then you went on that bus trip with the choir. Yes, she didn't join though. Exactly. Her mum suddenly took her out of it, because of asthma. And shortly after that she was gone. Look. With the white polo neck. Next to you. Yes, Mum, I see. No... Just look at that! How slim Helmut still was. It was a superstition. Everything will be fine if I don't tell anyone. I didn't go out much at the time, and whenever I bumped into someone I went across the street. No one ever asked if I was pregnant. There are books showing you how to do it yourself. My husband helped me. It goes quicker every time. The last one popped out of me so incredibly quickly. The last one was pretty. It was a boy. A quiet boy. He would've been strong. I think Erich knew it wasn't his kid. It wasn't important. He was our boy. He was so beautiful... I can't remember it with him. I remember the others. Fear overcame me... of them. These fleshy worms, these... little fleshy... They haunted me in my dreams. I couldn't breastfeed them. I would've gotten infected, and then... Then they screamed and... It was all too much for me. Erich left every time. He knew what I was going to do. I took a cushion... and ta-da. It went quiet after that. They wouldn't have made it anyway. None of the three. Claudia was a child born in sin anyway. It happened before the marriage and I turned my back on our Father in Heaven. That's why she got a heathen name. I tried to call her Maria later on, but... For a child born in sin it's too late. Jakob... I can't remember it with him. I put him to my breast. I've never breastfed a child, but... I put him to my breast. He didn't want to. It was the other way round. He didn't want to get infected. He resisted and... cried, and... Then he went quiet. I've never seen a baby go so quiet. I can't remember the rest. He was gone then. I don't remember. I don't remember anything else. I don't remember. Thank you, Ms Engelmayer. Yes, thank you. - Officer Herzog? - All four of them. I went to school with your daughter. With Claudia. All four of them. Ms Engelmayer, Claudia was never found. - She might still be alive. - Officer Herzog. I'd like to find Claudia. Please don't. Officer, we're leaving. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Bye. I have several reasons to reprimand you. The case is closed and I'll let it go... as I just don't have time for that. But you acted very unprofessionally in there. I think you know that, right? Yes. - Are you not going to Gars? - No, I'm going to St. Polten. - Was that it? - Yes, officer. That was it. FOUR WEEKS LATER Shit... There. There are two types of people. Those who watch while you're sewing them up or cutting them, and those who look away. Very philosophical. I would have liked to elaborate, but it's a bit dull now. No, go on, tell me. What kind of people like to look? The optimists. They can't wait to see that things are fine again. If you say so. There. I'll prescribe some painkillers, and in ten days I'll take out the stitches. This is a Grauburgunder from Langenlois. Quite common at first glance, but it has a fine acidity. I don't care. Just give it to me. Let him be. He talks about it and no one drinks it. You're all peasants. I feel sorry for you, Yannick. - Go ahead, drink. - Or what? - We still have the red one. - Exactly. Is it good? I'm sure it's good, but... just give me a beer. - You're so nasty. - What? I don't like wine. - I do. - And me. Can you make me a pint? An alcohol-free one please, though. What's up? Are you being a bore or are you on duty? Good evening. He's so charismatic. He'd be a great mayor. Not when he's a fag. - Oh, stop it. - Stay here, beer drinker. Without you, it's just a girlie party. - Good evening, ladies. - Evening. - Hello, Doctor. - Would you like to joins us? We're tasting wines. Oh, that's sweet, but... I'm dead tired. We just went for a run and wanted to get takeaway. Is the kitchen still open, boss? If I'm the boss, it's still open. - Great. - What do you want? Two goulash and a salt pretzel if you have one. - Right away. - Thank you. - How's your hand? - Better. Yeah? Great. For while you're waiting. - A Grauburgunder from Langenlois. - That's kind of you. Cheers, Doctor. - Ladies. - To you. - To your health. - Cheers. And where's the husband? He is waiting outside. Is he your husband already? You're not allowed yet, right? We are. We've been partnered for some years. - "Partnered." - I'm going out. - We're in a domestic partnership. - Okay. Why won't you come in? Why did you come out? I don't know. Is it fun inside? Well... They'll get used to it. It'll be fine. Do you really think so? I'm an optimist. - Hi. - Hi. Was Ladenigg also here because of Schmiedel? Yes. We should go over there. It was the fourth complaint. It's going beyond a neighbourly dispute now. Ladenigg says he killed his dog. So we finally have a murder case again. We won't need St. Polten for this. Oh, please don't remind me. Hey, HP. I thought so. - Congratulations. - I don't want to tell anyone. I don't want to talk about it. No one knows. And I wanted to ask if I can continue with the Trummler case? For what? I can't stop thinking about it. Because... - We still don't know everything. - Ulli, we don't have to. Well, okay... Maybe you're too young for this sobering realisation. So? I'm taking Janosch to Schmiedel. You go and play, but be discreet. Oh. The senior inspector sits in that bakery over there every day. Gruber. You should talk to him. - Hello. - Good afternoon, officer. - The daily special? - Yes. Yes, please. Hello, Mr Gruber. I'm Ulli Herzog. Yes. I know. Sit down. Hans-Peter called me. He was stationed in Burgenland when the girl disappeared. Yes, he said you might know something that's not in the file. Unlucky people. I didn't ask what you wanted to drink. - Ah. Two small beers. - Right away, Inspector. But an alcohol-free one for me. On duty. Exemplary. I don't believe in... the paranormal. But even I would say... that house was cursed. They were desperate people. Even their child. Yes, we found her diary. It was the diary... of a depressed person. And it was a ten-year-old child! What was in the diary? Nothing that helped. She talked about a school trip, a performance with the choir, about school. Nothing personal, you might say. But with such a sadness... My god. And you know what? Her parents... were never mentioned in the diary. That girl was alone in the world. What do you think happened to her? Vanished without a trace. We didn't find a single lead. Not enough to come up with a theory. It was as if... That was my feeling... We didn't pay attention to gut feelings then. As if... she wanted to disappear. Into thin air. DEPARTMENT STORE HERZOG - Hi. - Hello, Ulli. Yes? No. Is it ready? - Mm-hm. - Was it expensive? - Not too bad. It was just the fan belt. - Great. I was afraid we'd need a new one. What shall we take home? Pickles? What do you feel like eating? Fish sticks. Fish sticks. Okay. I forgot my jacket. - Oh, Georg? Sorry. - Yes? It's about my overtime. I wanted to ask if... Okay, let's see... It's my mum's birthday... What are you cooking? Vegetable lasagne. Benjamin is such a carnivore. Doctors are often the least healthy. True. What is your job? I don't have one at the moment. - Housewife. - That's also a job, I've heard. Yes. I'm a fitness trainer actually. - I'm just waiting until... - Ulli? I'm ready. Come over for dinner sometime. Georg is a good cook. Fish, for example. I hope you still have the invoice. It was to be a surprise. No one buys a pram in the tenth week. Why not? You're doing well. I want to act as if there's nothing until... Until what? Until it's there? Nice to see you. Come in. - Thank you for the invitation. - You're welcome. Hello. Thanks. Thank you. Nice glasses. They belonged to my grandmother. Georg would like everything to be new. - But I like them. - I have nothing against them. As long as they're full. Yes... I thought of a wine cellar right away when we found the house. But now it's... Sorry, I didn't want to spoil the mood. What mood? Sorry. This evening has been odd, don't you think? Or is it us? We don't have gays in Krumau. At least no gay couples. It... It's rather conservative here. You don't say. But don't worry. We don't want anything from you. Cool. But thanks for being so honest. Ulli taught me that. No... I wouldn't say that. When you're with a police officer, you don't lie, because there's no point. She looks at me and knows everything. So I tell her the truth right away. So tell me, what brought you here? Anyone who comes here from Vienna is just a weekend camper. They buy some simple cabin, because it's cheap, and then work on it on the weekends, learn to fish, and never wear clothes that are warm enough. At some point they don't return. It's actually Matthias' fault. We wanted to get out of the city. I looked around Baden and Klosterneuburg, but it was all insanely expensive and not really in the country. Then Matthias took over and found this amazing house for a great price. You should forget about it and build a wine cellar anyway. I need a smoke. Anyone coming? I'll come. Suddenly you have to manage it all. Career, family, build a house. Go running. Stop smoking. When I was 25 it was all about the fire brigade. And now... I have a belly and am losing my hair. Now imagine being a total failure because you choose a man rather than a woman. It's normal in Vienna though, right? I mean, it's nothing special. It's not so normal for my parents. They'd like grandchildren. - Only child? - Yes. So is Ulli. I liked being one. I didn't have to share anything. - That's why you never learned to. - I give you enough. Hey... Go away or I won't win. You won't now anyway. How old are you anyway? Are you working on having kids? If I may ask. Doctor confidentiality. Well... Working on it... is about right. I had two miscarriages. I'm sorry. Do you have a good gynaecologist? I can refer you to one in Vienna. - It's okay. - He might know a good one. Hormone therapy would be an option. - But the side effects are... - I did that already. Okay. Well, sometimes it just takes time. There you go. You're good. I know. - Sorry. I shouldn't have said... - No. It's fine, really. If you really want a child, you could adopt one. There are many children without parents. In Krumau you can forget about that. Why? What do you mean? I know the people here. I grew up here. You don't want to be the one with an adopted child. You just want to be totally normal. I think the drink just got to him. It was a great evening, thanks. We'll invite you over next time. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. You're really scaring me that it won't work out again. I finally want to rejoice. Welcome and good morning, Lower Austria. It's 6:30am and we'll take a look at the weather in Lower Austria, which is... Matthias. Do you want a ride? I should do more sport, too. Shall we run together sometime? Hey, are you not talking to me anymore? ON HOUSE CALL Hello? Go away! - Yes? - Benjamin? - It's Ulli Herzog. - Hi, yeah. Can you come over? It's Matthias. - What's up with him? - Just come quickly. Otherwise I'll call an ambulance. It's okay... Come. Here. Can you stay with him? I'll get a sedative. You'll feel better in a moment. You'll be okay soon, honey. Soon. I'll be there soon. Just keep breathing. You're doing well. There. It'll be over soon. Everything's okay. Everything's okay. Just a little prick. You know it. There. It's done. Great. It's done. It's done. That's good. That's good. He gets panic attacks irregularly. Why? Sorry, that's private. Yeah, sure. I understand. Please don't tell anyone, okay? Of course not. The thing with the cellar is really affecting him. Thanks for calling me right away. Are you coming, Ulli? - Where to? - Planquadrat, in Wienerstrasse. The early drinkers are on their way home. - Have fun. - Bye. Bye. No, thanks. I... Any progress with Claudia Trummler? No. Everyone who was questioned at the time either moved away or died. - Talk to her mother again? - Am I allowed to? It'll be fine. I can see she means something to you. I didn't care about her at the time. I don't know why I have this strong feeling she's still alive. Are you crazy? It's freezing. I can't breathe. - What are you doing? - I'm going to the baby room. Come back to bed. For what? I'll close the window. No need to get so angry. I didn't imagine it to be like this. What? Us. Us in this house. How did you imagine it? That it'd be nice. I think we're doing well. The loan and everything... The house is empty all the time. You're constantly working. Even when you're home, you're not here. - You work 40 hours too... - I want to have a baby! With you. And I want that to be important to you. But you act like nothing's going on. You want me to be at home with the baby? You want us to be like everyone else? Yes. Did I go out last night? Out? Why? Maybe I just dreamt it. I'll go make breakfast. I'll eat at work. Her condition has stabilized. I'd like to release her before the end of the month. How was she after her talk with us? She cried, but... She was calm. No hysteric fits. She asked for sleeping pills, then woke up the next day and was... quite approachable. Sensible. Shall we go and have a smoke? - It's fine. - Thanks. She never told me as much as she told you. The worst thing is you get so fat on the medication. I was never vain. To what end? But so fat... I don't think you're fat at all. It was a miracle that Claudia turned out so pretty. Like she wasn't ours. No, she was. I did a test. We were so unlucky. Why? Wasn't she healthy? The only one who knew about it was Christian. Christian Deisenberger? The teacher? I couldn't tell the priest. Or the doctor. It had to come out at some point. Christian was kind to me. He didn't want the child in the end, but he was kind to me. He was the only one I trusted. Christian. He was really a good person. What problem did Claudia have as a baby? - Her asthma already? - Oh, no. She never had asthma. But at school we were always told she... What were we supposed to do? She wouldn't have undressed next to the other kids. Did she have some kind of abnormality? It was dreadful. She had both. At some point you have to decide. And we said... half a girl is better than half a boy. A son and heir must be flawless. She had both. And the male part grew... We should've cut it off. Did you think I wouldn't find out? It's lovely that HP is allowing you to do this. But you can't just go past the head of the investigation. You said this wasn't part of the case. Did you find Claudia? Yes. - Close the door. - Sorry. The front door was open. I can't believe people still do this. I live in the past. I was beginning to think you wouldn't get it. You were... a child. A girl, you mean. Deisenberger recognised me. And what did he say? "You've grown." I don't belong in your photo album. Why not? You're the end. What do you mean? It will be my story. From my childhood to running away, the children's care homes... The training, education, all the way to Benjamin. And to when I came back here. How did my people not find you? I didn't say a word. I had no papers, I cut my hair short. I threw my clothes away. I was a silent boy in rags. They caught me at some border. And then I was taken to a Czech care home. That wasn't very nice. I ran away when I was 14... To the crisis centre in Vienna. Still not saying a word. And then they thought I was a refugee. Unaccompanied and traumatised. It was actually very easy. When I finally spoke... I spoke with a Czech accent. Nobody was looking for a Czech boy with my face. The psychologist was sweet. And I was allowed to choose a new name. That was the best moment. Why did you choose Matthias? Do you remember the Matthias in my class? He was so handsome. And he had nice parents. I mean, my parents were not bad people. I know. But my dad couldn't look me in the eye. He would have been a nice man. He suffered because I wasn't normal. And your mum? Didn't sleep much. Wandered around the house like a ghost. Didn't go out unless it was really important. And she prayed. She always prayed. But she didn't go to church. I think she thought... the priest would notice it. Did you know about the other kids? Do you think I would've come back if I'd known? Does Benjamin know it was your parents' house? You mustn't tell him. But you have to tell him. Do you know what happened to your parents? Your mother is still alive. I want to unite him with his mother. - Do I need permission for that? - Come on, Mrs Herzog. So you won't help me. Mrs Trummler confessed and you solved a case that was discarded 23 years ago. That's not a bad job. It's not yet over for me. For the police everything else is irrelevant. I was never like you. - So annoying? - So persistent. Don't change. - And you need to stop smoking. - Okay. Why are you creeping around in the cold? You need to help me, sir. We were on first name terms. Do you want to come in? Please. The child attracted me, not her mother. Sit down. She was a very special girl. So big and sporty. Like an Amazon. And at the same time, so sensitive. And quiet. I know people said I overstepped boundaries. That may be. I would've apologised, but no one wanted to hear my apology. They wanted me to go. Although nothing happened. I'm not like that. I'm not sick. I just felt a longing for the girls... I would've... loved to have had one. God forgot about us. Everyone had kids. But he overlooked us. One would've been enough. Just one girl. Just one girl. I would've always protected her. I would've liked to have had one like Claudia. They treated her so badly. It broke my heart. She came to me once... I wanted to say something to her, or give her something... Something the parents might've needed. And for a short moment, I thought... What if I keep her here with me? Would they even notice? Or would they even be happy about it? - Hello. - Hi. Hello, Ms Engelmayer. I brought someone with me. You put on weight. You also haven't gotten any younger. It's up to Ms Engelmayer to decide if she wants to come along. I explained that. Mr Vukovic will accompany her. Ms Engelmayer... Mr Deisenberger and I would like to introduce you to someone. Back home in Krumau. I mean... If that's okay with you. He made me a child. You're impossible, Marlene. It was a boy. We can start putting on a scarf for the autumn weather with our current autumn fashion trends. Rain jackets in sand colours and beige tones are the latest craze. Autumn calls for chequered shirts, preferably in red or rusty tones, combined with olive green trousers. We wish you lots of fun on walks and just being outside, while listening to your favourite channel, Radio Lower Austria. We are with you in all seasons and with all the latest fashion trends. Are you expecting someone? - Hello. - Hello, Ulli. This is a bit of a surprise, but... I didn't know how else to do this. This is Ms Trummler, maiden name Engelmayer. She's an inpatient at the psychiatric ward in Floridsdorf. Hello. Ludwig. Hi. Do you live here? Yes, we just moved in. Nice house. - But a lot of work. - Yes. There's a lot to renovate, definitely. If you want to take a look around, be my guest. You didn't tell him. You didn't come back here for no reason. Surely you want to look her in the eye. How dare you? I just think that everything you block out... can destroy you. That's what people say who have nothing to block out. My practice is upstairs. And the living quarters are there. We're still not sure what to do with the second floor. It's nice. It's nice when new life comes into old houses. I like that. She might really not remember. Traumas can cause that. Hello. Would you like to see the inside of the house? I don't want to take off my shoes. You can keep them on. I'd like to show you something. - Come with me. - Matthias. Come, it's fine. Come. Matthias. - What? - Leave it. No. We have a nice cellar. But we've done nothing with it yet. It's a nice cellar anyway. My husband would like a wine cellar. I'd like to hear your opinion. I want to go home now. You are home. Come, Ms Marlene, we'll leave now. Just leave them for a moment. - It's okay. - Let's go now. - She doesn't want to. - Let's go. - Okay. - Let's leave now. Matthias... Careful. Ms Trummler. Thank you for coming. I don't know why the doctor allowed this. It's about processing the past. What do you know about it? You're a policewoman. - Not a therapist. - I only wanted... To do what's best for her, sure. - Hey! - Just let him. A few minutes. Have you got nothing else to say? Huh? Have you got nothing else to say? - Huh? - No! Go away! Look at me. We could've... Right after your birth... drowned you in a bag like a kitten. I couldn't do it. That was a mistake. Now get out. Come on! Get out! This will have consequences. You know that! Stay out. Drive! Do I still have time to change? Why? I like the way you look. Must be sad. Alone in a big house like that. Maybe he'll come back. He came back once already. What are you measuring? The thickness of the nuchal fold. This is not an entirely reliable diagnostic tool. It just gives us an idea of any possible abnormalities, or anomalies. Is there an abnormal value? It's a bit higher than usual. - So what happens now? - Well... We'll do a combined test first to look at your blood levels and hormones. Should the results confirm the suspicion, we'll do an invasive examination, an amniotic fluid puncture. But don't be too worried now. Nothing is certain yet. Can you already see what it is? It's very early to say, but... probably a girl. MOTHER-CHILD PASS I won't do the examination. I don't care what's up with her. I'm so happy it's going to be a girl.
