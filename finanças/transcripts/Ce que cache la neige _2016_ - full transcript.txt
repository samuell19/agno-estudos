What the Snow Hides I'm in a meeting. I'll join you when it's over. Agreed. Can't wait to see your swing again, sir. A tailor-made solution to your problems! Hello Alexandre. Ang√©lique. Welcome! Were the photos I gave you alright? So... Clemence, 31 years old, brown hair, blue eyes, 170 cm, slim, translates Asian novels. My wife. Not too much make-up. Like the photo, hair up. Okay, a natural look. Great! Now, for beginners, I always suggest a blade. A kitchen knife is effective, easy to handle, fail-proof. - I'd rather drown her. - That's tricky. Nothing complicated, just hold her head down in the bath. Yes, but she might hold her breath. Can you hold her down long? I enjoy a challenge. You just learnt your wife cheated on you. You want to kill her. That's natural. But an easy method the first time guarantees success. What if she says: "Could have been better"? You've got lots of options. Slit her throat, stab her in the stomach, slash her wrists... "Stab her"? - That sounds good. - It's very popular. I come home early. Her lover just left. She's in the lounge, caught off guard. An element of surprise! We talk a bit, play cat and mouse, then I tell her I know everything... - I love it. But leave some of it to chance, let events unfold naturally. A blade is best. Ah! One last thing. I want her to have this on her. Once we've set it up, your anger will be just a bad memory. marital lounge Hello, my love. Hello, darling. You're home early. My last appointment was cancelled. I wanted to see you. And you? Had a good day? Nothing special. I saw a novelist. I'm translating her book. Oh, wonderful. It was important to meet her, to grasp what she wants. Obviously. But... I've been pretending you're a better golfer than me for years! And you still won't give me a raise?! Take that, sir! This is what a real swing looks like. You want a different set-up? No problem. No, her face! Her face isn't right. She should look similar. That's perfect. Can't we change something? Her cheekbones, her nose? Stop second-guessing. The idea is to let yourself go. Your wife looks lovely in that dress. That's not my wife. It's an actress made up like my wife. That's your take? How do you expect me to take it? I use this service too, you know. After a fight, I suffocated my father and I feel great. Relax. No one's judging you here. Think of the time you felt closest to your wife. Visualise that time and then remember what she did to you. It's a Chinese love symbol. All the Chinese have them. I want you to keep it on you. I've cheated on you too. - Pardon? - A year ago. You did something stupid. I did too. Let's talk about it. We'll get through it. Let's not chuck it all. It's pathetic, clinging on like this. You only forgive me because you're scared of losing me. Our relationship is empty. The promises we made, the secrets we shared, the nights we spent together, they meant nothing to me. Because I've never loved you. Don't move! A tailor-made solution to your problems! Subtitles: Eclair Media
