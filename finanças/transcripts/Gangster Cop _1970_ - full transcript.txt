A TOEl PICTURE Hey. - What? - Tetsuji Asai? I'm arresting you for possession of a firearm. Really? Search me. Take your time. Well, Officer? Did you find anything? Stop there. What's that? Obviously, my jewels. Hey. Wait! Shit. YAKUZA DEKA Produced by Koji Ohta & Masao Sato Screenplay by Fumio Kounami & Yukio Noda Starring Shinichi Chiba Ryoji Hayama, Rinichi Yamamoto, Ryohei Uchida Machiko Yashiro, Yoko Nogiwa Toru Yuri, Toshiaki Minami Directed by Yukio Noda Thank you. Cops and women are persistent. I'll pay you back for this sometime. Yeah? You owe me for this. I know. I'll make you rich. Let's go. - Are you sure? - Of course. Havve you all bet? - Double. - All ready. First half. Let's not celebrate yet. The second half. See. Hold it. - What do you have in your hand? - What? Don't start a fight over nothing. Open it any way. Wow. I was right. You demonstrated your skills well. But did you know this place belongs to me, Miyoshi of the Yashiro Gang? What I didn't know was that Miyoshi, the elite of the Yashiro Gang, used such cheap tricks. - What a surprise. - It is. Where's the proof? Proof? You've seen the card. It's just a card. What matters is who held it. What? Who is more trustworthy? You? Or me, with my long-established credibility? Let's ask the others. Let me handle this. Damn. - What day is it today? - Friday the 13th. A bad day. Hey... The police are planning a roundup today. It starts at 10:30, at all the gambling houses in Tokyo. Shut up. That won't get you out of this. But it's true, I'm telling you. The police are coming! A roundup! Mr Miyoshi. This way. You're under arrest for the obstruction of official duties. Thanks. Be careful. Isn't it a bit high? There! - Let's go. - OK. One... two... three... You're under arrest for gambling. Ouch, let go, you bastard. You're so noisy! I can't sleep. You've got silly chest hair, like a teenager's pubic hair. There must be something wrong with your nose. At least you've got two holes. Bastard... It tickles! Hey, Hay ata-kun. Get out. Hay ata-kun! Hay ata-kun? There isn't any one you can be that friendly with in here. Right, mate? Hey, wake up. Don't tell me... Yes, I'm a cop. Don't look at me like that. You were a bit slow. How else could I get such information? So that's what it was. Damn you... Don't get upset. If you're born poor, your only choice is to be a yakuza like you or a cop like me. In a way, we're family. Right? So don't worry about trivial things. I've got to go. See you. Wait there. Hey, Mr Hayata. You may be a cop on the outside, but behind bars, we are equal so let's get even. Stop. Shut up, bastard. That's a serious crime. Ouch. Obstruction of official duties. Shut up! Bodily injury. TOKYO METROPOLITAN POLICE A STUPID COP JOINED THE YAKUZA Thank you. Without your help, I'm just an ex-cop, and would have been dead on the street. But I don't think you owe me this much. I wonder what will be next. Don't worry. You can do a lot of work for me. I hope so. You've got good hips. Hey. Gentlemen. I was born and bred in Nagoya. Nagoy a is a big city with its streets... you walk down Nishiki Street, you'll find a zoo. Turn left there... No, that's a one-way. - Get lost. - I haven't finished yet. - Get lost. - And geishas are... You're disturbing the guests. You're good, señor. POLICE A cop, eh? You are under arrest for injuring a police officer. I won't forget this. What did you say? Injuring? Let me handle this. Oh, you got my eyes. I can't see. Welcome, mister. Don't be silly. You'll get more than just an injury next time. Mr Asai from Headquarters is here. Oh, it's you, Detective. You got out of jail so fast because you're a big man in the Yashiro Gang. Thank you for the other night. Don't worry about it. - I won't forgive you... - Easy, easy. I'm not a detective any more. Look. They even published my photo in the paper. Ready? You are good. So are you. We could fight forever. Why don't you sell your skills to us? It's a waste hanging around here. Yashiro Headquarters can pay you a lot. I'm a real bargain. You won't be insured, but you will be well paid. You quit because of the money, didn't you? That's right. Let's make a deal. Here. Oh, we've been waiting. Hayata. You've passed the first stage. The real work starts now. I heard Mineo helped you a lot. He's such trouble. Alright. Let's start. The Yashiro Gang is obviously the biggest criminal organisation in Japan. Headed up by this man - Sumitaro Yashiro. The ultimate purpose of our operation is to destroy his organisation. Kunio Nishi, the leader of the musclemen. His right-hand man, Kurihara, the best assassin in Japan. You've met Tetsuji Asai. But none of these men are our main targets. Remember the face of the man in the hat. He doesn't have his own gang any more. He's President of The Akutsu Trading Company. And he is the financier of the Yashiro Gang. As you can see, Akutsu is our core target. Hayata, try to find a way into his organisation. We need to cut off their money flow. Arresting petty gangs for fighting won't help us. That makes no difference to the Yashiro. They're funded by tax evasion and blackmailing? It can be any thing. We need clear evidence. We're counting on you. Mineo will help you. Take these, just in case. - Thank you. - I'll see you soon. Look out for a lost dog ad in the newspaper. It's my signal. Look out for that. Don't make mistakes. - All the best, sir. - Thanks... what? A dog, OK? This is Miura, the guy I told you about. How do you do? He worked in Azumi Trading's New York office. What was your mistake? A woman, sir. I spent company money, the usual story. Then he went downhill and became a dope pusher. But he'd made some connections with American gangs. It'll make our business easier. He speaks English, of course. I see. Do they have the stuff ready for us? Yes, they told Miura over the phone last night that the two men in charge are coming soon. I know one of them. They've been trading with the Okura Gang. But they're switching to us. So they want us to make sure there will be no trouble with Okura. In other words, they want Okura dead? Yes. As this is delicate stuff, they don't want to draw any attention from the police. That's quite natural, isn't it? I've discussed the matter with Nishi. We want that ex-cop to deal with it. I've sent Asai for him. I think he's suitable, with his skills... Alright. Do whatever you like. Then I'll go back to the office. See you. Hey. YASHIRO CO. LTD If you want to test me, do it fairly. What's that? Don't even think about drowning me. Wait. Whatever happened to you had nothing to do with us. Why would we? We hired you. I was attacked. You were the only ones who knew I was coming here. I think I know who did it. It must have been the Okura Gang. Oh, I know. The Okura Gang is afraid of you joining us. If that's true - and from what they've done to me - I guess you're assigning me some job to do with the Okura Gang. Kill Okura. Tomorrow afternoon, the politician who backs him will hold a conference. Okura will be there, for certain. PARTY CONFERENCE That's Okura. Shit. Boss! Go! You never said it was bullet-proof! Damn... Go down. They mustn't know who he is. Shit. This way. Come on. Look that way. - Come on. - What? Come on! Keep still. Where have they gone? They are so fast. Hey. - Don't move... - Hey, don't do that! Shut up. It's a life and death situation. You really don't know? Okura. Don't accuse me for the wrong reason. We've settled the reconciliation. Why would I try to kill you now? Alright. I'll let you claim your innocence. But there's one thing I want to tell you. What is it? We can't say out loud... Huh? About the business we've been handling. I've heard that you are showing some interest in it. I have no idea what you're talking about. Do you always play the innocent? You're making the wrong assumption. Alright. But we'll watch your next move, and do what we have to. Don't threaten an old man. Hey. Nishi. He is aware of it. That ex-cop you've brought in... he should make up for today's failure. It's your responsibility. Yes, sir. How's that guy? Very good. Well? Amazing. Give me your knife. This isn't a toy. Well? Great. That makes four. That's the Okura Recreation Centre. See the guards? It means Okura is here. Do you work here? No. Does it bother you? Where are you going? Who's there? Get out, girls. Go. What do you want? Your funeral. Think you can do that? Don't move. Go! Up there. Run, everybody, run! Hey, friends. This is faster. How was it? - He went to hell naked. - Well done. - Are the others safe? - Yeah. Good. Excuse me for letting my self in. Ouch. You frightened me. What do you want? Asai has seen it all. I've done my job. - Are you sure Okura's dead? - If you doubt me, ask Asai. I'm tired. Alright. It's your turn to die now. - You're kidding. - I'm not. Is that Mr Yashiro's way of rewarding me? No more use for me, eh? You could say that. I'm going to kill you. After I've risked my life for you, you try to kill me? Do you still say that you play fair? What's this all about? Mr Nishi. Will you explain this to me? No explanation is required. He was Okura's spy. That isn't true. - Boss! - What is true? If he's a spy, show me the proof. No, boss. No, boss! Please stop. Help. Don't kill me... You ordered me to... I'll take your word for now. Well, the job is done. I guess it's about time for me to meet Mr Yashiro. You're becoming very demanding... No, I'm not. But this is a chance to meet the biggest man in Japan. I'll flatter him as much as possible, and climb up the ladder, just as you do. What do you think I quit the police for? Well, you'll meet him someday. Thanks. Hello, boss. This is Hayata, who killed Okura. I'm Hayata. It's a privilege to meet you, sir. I still can't believe this. I'll remember you. Thank you, sir. Would you like to say anything? Yes. I'd like to have a drink with you. Not yet. I see. Then in order to make the best use of me, can you transfer me to the Akutsu Trading Company? If I stay with Mr Nishi, the police will be after me. - What do you think, Akutsu? - Why not? You seem to have done your homework. Come to my office later. You waste no time. Thanks for everything, Mr Nishi. See you later. Thank you. Let's go. Thank you. What a funny guy. He may be acting. We'll be prepared, just in case. Remnants of the Okura Gang are still around. He may come in handy as a body guard. His face is too famous to work for Nishi. Use him while you can, and dispose of him after that. - Welcome back. - No phone calls? No. Quite a nice girl. I know what to do. This is a nice club. Mr Akutsu owns this place. Oh, it's luxurious. You seem to enjoy working for the company. Not really. But I'm well paid. Are you Mr Akutsu's mistress? No. I'm his pet cat. But I don't wag my tail like some dogs. I just want money. Unfortunately, I'm a stray dog. I wag my tail for anyone... ...whoever feeds me. - A drink? - Same as yours, please. - Can I have a cigarette? - Please do. Does Miura bother you? Or the girl? He doesn't look like a born yakuza. May be not. He's the ex-overseas representative of some big company. Why he's here now? He lost his way through a woman and drinking. I don't know much, but guess that's about it. Everybody has a dark past. Not only him. You, too? It's not a good topic for a date. Why are you sniffing around me? No reason. I'm the same as you. I love girls, drinks, and money, like you. How annoying. Only I don't stink like an ex-cop does. May be I've had too much to drink. But the dirty stray dog suddenly looks like a reliable wolf. Did you find anything? It seems like you slept with me because Akutsu told you to. You knew, then. He doesn't trust anyone easily. No. And I'm his cat sneaking around the bed and stealing. I do anything for money. I don't believe it. A little while ago... ...you made me forget about Akutsu. You'd better quit the drugs. Don't tell me that you've fallen for Hayata? As long as you need dope, you can't leave me. Thank you. MISSING DOG: NAMED HAYABUSA CONTACT HOKKAI RESTAURANT HOKKAI RESTAURANT Hey, mister. Cha-shao noodle, wonton. Give me a light, please. - It's too much. - Not at all. Don't look around. Pull this. San-su sit down. You look better in that. - This is our contact place? - Yes. Do you want this? No? Two glasses of water. We got information from Interpol. Two foreigners are arriving at Haneda Airport at 1:45. They are from the syndicate. They'll be here to settle the deal. Nice to meet you. Welcome. I go for any one. Excuse me. You've got a handful already. This way, please. Good one, good one. Have a good look. Peel it, admire it, and taste it... Hard bananas are delicious. We don't need a rotten one. You don't need to act anymore. - What did he say? - A call from Hong Kong. Hong Kong... Take this. Hide, quick. Oh, you found me. There are so many quality bottles. I was going to take... Do you always look for things in the dark? I know my way around. This is a photo of the international conference of drug control. I'm surprised to see you're a cop. You've been fooling us for a long time. They do have a good syndicate for information. They saved my life. Hey, Miura. How much have you reported? Isn't this quite a show? Hey, this is no place for you. Get out. What did he do, anyway? Is he a police spy or something? You're not a spy, are you? - You know me. - Have a good look. You don't want to be like him, do you? If you want me to trust you, shoot him with this. Can't you do that? I'm too drunk. Come on. It sounds like fun. What's happening? It's not like you to miss the target. I can't. I'm too drunk to aim. Let me do it. A cat takes time to kill a mouse. Next, right in the middle. He's bitten his tongue off! Hey. What is it, old lady? Old lady? I'm still young. What are you doing? Writing a love letter. Aren't you doing something naughty? It's too old-fashioned to write love letters. The girls nowadays want different equipment. So won't you buy this? This will make girls cry with joy. Look here... Why are you looking around? No? How about this? I used it last night. Buy this, please... Alright. Oh, thank you... Take this to the Hokkai Restaurant. The Hokkai Restaurant? What's inside? Hey, sir, your change. Well, thanks. Wait. What is it? I can't handle so many at once. What did he give you? He didn't give me anything. Don't hit my breasts. What if they shrink? "10pm tomorrow, on the Silverna, at Yokohama Port." "Alterations expected. Agent Miura dead." Give it back to me! Shit, they kicked me in the balls... So Hayata was... You weren't careful enough. I'm glad we found out now. He won't get away. Damn it! I had a hunch. Boss, I'll do it. I'll put bullets in his head. Make sure you kill him. They know every thing about you. Get out. Quick. Hello? Hello? It's you. Sure, it's me again. You've made me look like a fool. Cops are dirtier than I am. Not dirtier than drugs. Take your gun out. Go ahead! Asai... It's a shame to say goodbye to you. But they say the good die young. If you hadn't helped me, I would have been... Sorry. Wait! Wait. Go after him. Hayata! Why did you help me? What made you do that? I just didn't want you to die. That's all. Where are they doing the deal? Is that all you want to say? That's all. Tell me where. You've got a nerve, as usual, Detective. But you've lived long enough. Are you alright? Hang on. Don't worry about me. They are at... Yashiro's second house in Izu. I got it. Hurry. Thank you. They're from the Okura Gang! Don't worry. Go. Shit. Another! Boss! Boss! - Shit. - What is it? Ouch. Señor, where are the criminals? "Señor"? Give me a break. Hey! You don't need to disguise yourself anymore! No need for a horse? I was a bit late, wasn't I? Well, I have no choice... The Yashiro Gang has been destroyed. Well done. You're pretty good. Hey! - Enjoy. - Give me back the horse! Hey! THE END
