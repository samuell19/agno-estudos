Subtitles by explosiveskull And this is the common room. We've got boardgames, some books, you can watch TV. I now Veronica... Ronnie. What? Ronnie. Nobody calls me Veronica. It seems like you're all set with the forms so it's just a matter of checking your phone. Why you gotta check my phone? Your focus here is on getting well. The outside world can distract from that. You kidding me with this? Ronnie, this is non negotiable. You give us the phone or we call the sheriff and you go to jail. Fine. All right. Thanks. Katherine? Katherine? Hi. Hello. Uh, this is Katherine... Yeah, what do we have roommates? No, Katherine gets confused. Her mother used while she was pregnant and she grew up in a family of addicts. Katherine? Katherine, you're in the wrong room again. I'm gonna escort you back to your own room okay? Okay. Let's go. Hey? Get the fuck out of my room. Ronnie. I'm sorry. Katherine? Let's go. Okay, wait here a moment and I'll take you back to your own room. Just wait here, wait here. She's been fighting heroin addiction for years. She's lost everything. It's very sad. Just keep her out of my room. Smoke? What? Do you want a cigarette? Um, I don't know if this is what they mean by enabling. What have you got? Lights. What about you. We smoke the same thing. Shit. Um, okay. It's uh nice to meet you? Ronnie. So how long have you been here Ronnie? A couple hours. Us too. We, got here about an hour ago. Yeah. So, junk? Yeah, both, both of us. Thanks. Sure. No problem. Good evening everyone. For those who have not yet met me my name is Dr. Taylor. I am the Chief Administrator here at Longview. I understand that for some of you this is your first group therapy session, and tonight it will be conducted by Dr. Barnes. Thank you. Hi everyone. Uh, you can call me Jessica if you like. A little about me, I got my degree from Temple Med. If you ever need to talk, feel free to find me. I'm here to listen. So let's begin. This is the talking stone. If you are holding the talking stone you have the floor. And everyone must be respectful and listen to you while you speak. If you are not holding the talking stone, you are not allowed to talk. Everyone understand? Good. Now I have the stone but now I'm done. So I'm going to pass it to Ronnie. Ronnie? Now, Ronnie is there anything in particular you'd like to talk about today? Past drug experiences, regrets or hopes for the future? No thanks. I got nothin' to say. Nothing? I don't believe that. How do you feel Ronnie? Say anything you want. Um, I am here, I don't wanna be. Um, you wanna know how I feel? That's it. Meg, let Ronnie hold the stone just a little bit longer. Can you talk a little bit about your life at home? Job, uh, family, what you do for fun? I think it's obvious what I do for fun. How about a job? How do you afford your fun? This is a safe space. There's no judgment here. Uh, I got a military pension and disability. So you were in the Army? Or the Marines? Were you overseas? Okay. Tina? Uh, so hey I'm Tina and I'm an addict. I've never done anything like this before but probably should've. Probably should've nipped it in the bud when it was just booze but I'm gonna feel over that stuff. It's just part of the job. You know? You didn't overdo it. You were like a paria. What the fuck's a paria? What field is this Tina? Standup. Standup comedy. Oh, shit. Tell a joke. Yeah, tell us a joke. I don't, I don't really. Louise, Beth please. Go on Tina. I mean that's about it for now. Um, things went too far and now I'm looking to get better and be part of the world again. Thank you Tina. Carla? Hey. I'm Carla, and I'm an addict. And well, I can't tell you the ways that I've let my family down, kids, my husband. When we first got married we had all these big dreams. And when I think of what we wanted then, and what we've had to settle for now... I'm, I'm sorry. Uh, hey Meg can I get another cigarette? Ronnie, please don't interrupt Carla when she's talking. She's not talking, she's crying. Ronnie. Beth? Well I'm Beth and I'm here because my boyfriend, well I guess my ex boyfriend now, the fuckin' asshole. Okay look, check it. Me and him, we had this deal. We would come here together and we would get clean together. So we split the cost, I got everything set up and then when I go to get him at his place he's fucking gone. He left town. I mean, you know, he left some note about goin' to stay with his cousin and some shit. I mean, he was the one that was all let's get clean and then he goes and he fuckin' splits? It was his idea the fuckin' little bitch. - Such a little... - Ronnie please sit, Beth isn't done. Hey, can I be excused? No. I just mean how much more of her shit do I have to listen to? I mean come on. - Excuse me? - Ronnie. You know what? Fuck you you piece of shit. You think just because you were in the Army it makes you somethin' fuckin' special? I got real problems okay? Yeah, fuck you. What'd you say? I said how much more of your shit do we have to listen to? No , you fuckin' bitch. You talk to me like that again and I'll make you sorry, I swear to fucking God. Look at me you fuckin' bitch. One, two, three, four, five. Ronnie! Stop this! Ronnie! Ronnie! Lovell? Lovell? You get her restrained now. All right, come on. Let's go. Beth, I'm sorry. No. So? How is she? Out cold. How's Beth? Not great. She's in a lotta pain and uh Louise, well she got her good too. She's got a broken nose. Ronnie being here and staying out of jail is contingent on her good behavior. So... So? So it's jail. Just like that? Just like that Jessica. I'm not nitpicking here. That was no ones definition of good behavior. Having her here is a danger to the other patients and for us. - You mean she's a liability - No. for the legal department? Dr. Taylor she's a vet. She served this country and then she comes back and, Afghanistan. Three tours. A year home after tour two, then back again. They go over there and fight for us. They see unspeakable things. They do unspeakable things and when they come back severely psychologically damaged, we think it's not our problem. Like they're these monsters to be banished from society. They told you this in school? It doesn't mean it's not true. So then you think uh, you're the one that can give her the help she needs. Uh you're, you're the one. Yes, you're the one who can save the monster. I think I need to try. And I think a good place to start would be not treating her like a monster. Jessica. Not tying her to her bed. I know because of your brother you wanna help her. That has nothing to do with... I get that but this is not a VA hospital. We're not set up for these kinds of things. She assaulted two patients. Won't she hate us then? Jessica, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but she is dangerous. She's proven that. One more strike. Half a strike. I'm sorry Jessica, my decision is final. But, she... Listen, this blizzard, it's gonna make the roads impassable for a day, maybe two but I need you to start working on her discharge paperwork now and I'm gonna call the sheriff. - Doctor Taylor, - I'm sorry Jessica. Please. Now please... - You, you don't... - No, no. Dr. Taylor I, I need your help. All right Dana, - is everything okay? - It's bad. How are you feeling? You here to kick me out? You attacked Beth and Louise and we have a one strike policy here. Fuck. Roads are bad but as soon as they're clear someone from the sheriff's department will come and pick you up. Can't you just dope me up so I can't do anything? That's not how we do things here. And it's not a permanent solution. So please do your best for now until it's time to discharge you. Are you feelin' better? I guess. You were just havin' withdrawal pains and stomach cramps. - It's very... - Doctor, I wanna leave. Why do you wanna leave? Uh, this just isn't working for me. You've only been here one day. Yeah, I know. I've tried. It won't work. You cannot let past failures prevent future success. I just don't think I can do it. Well if you feel that way why did you come here in the first place? Dana's put up with so much of my shit and she deserves better. I don't want her to spend the rest of her life cleaning up my messes. Yeah but well, wouldn't your leaving mean uh, greatly disappointing Dana? She wants you to get better uh, don't you think you owe it to her to give her more then just one day? I... Don't you think you owe it to her to help her with her addiction? I just, we never really squared things up doctor and I, I've uh, I've uh done some really bad things, some fucked up things in my life and uh, sometimes I think that it's too late. You know, I've gotta tell you Meg, a lot of addicts come here and they feel exactly the same way you do. You know what Meg? They overcome their demons and they get well. So don't you think if they can do it, that you can do it too? You okay? I'm fine. Um, after last night I just... Hey, you got a cigarette? Sure. Thanks. Do you feel like shit today? Yeah. Me too. I'm not loving it here but, I'd leave if it weren't for Dana but, I owe it to her. Well, just hang in there. Thanks. I will. Ronnie! It's okay, it's okay. Meg. No, no, no, no. Just wait, just wait. Come on. It's okay, it's okay. Let's get you off the floor. Let's get you off the floor. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Shit. Oh shit. It's okay. It's okay. How are you feeling? Does your hand hurt? I've been through worse. Ronnie, do you wanna talk about what happened this morning? Why did you try to hurt Meg? What made you do that? What did you see or think you saw? I saw uh, I, I saw a man. A man? You know this is an all female unit. This man you saw, was it someone from back in Afghanistan? Forget it. No. Wait, this is important. Was is someone from the... Just forget it. you know, aren't you discharging me? Isn't that why you're here? Beth is hurt. Louise's nose is broken so yes. Right now Dr. Taylor wants you gone. As soon as the snow melts he wants the sheriff to come and take you to jail. Great. Your only way to avoid that is if you talk to me, now. Right now and if you tell me what's wrong, I will help you and I can take that and give something to Dr. Taylor and that way, I'm not promising anything, but maybe you can stay. Do you think you can control yourself while you're here? I don't know. You were in Afghanistan. Three tours, got a Purple Heart. Do you wanna talk about your time overseas? No. It's okay. You can, you can talk to me. I know what it's like. Oh yeah? How many tours did you do doc? Remind me, how long were you over there? Not me personally. I never served but I had a brother who was Army and he... Oh, please. Send him in here. I'll talk to him but you? Come on. Aw shit. He didn't come back did he? Let's keep this about you. Um, so in Afghanistan I imagine you saw and engaged in violent acts... I was in a war. You know seeing and perpetrating violence can be terribly damaging to the human psyche. You're not the first veteran I've treated and helped deal with trauma they experienced while fighting. Talking about it helps. Believe me, it's the best thing for you. Ronnie? What? Do you want to get clean? I'm here because of the court, you know that. I didn't choose to be here. So why would I wanna get clean when getting high makes everything go away? It numbs up my nerve damage, takes away all my problems. Fucking heroin takes better care of me then the VA ever did so why would I wanna be clean? Because statistics indicate that given your history, if you don't get clean soon you will die and I... I wanna die. What? I want to die. I don't believe you. I don't give a shit if you do. If you really wanted to kill yourself, you would've done it by now. Get out. We're done here. Ronnie I... Get out! Katherine? Katherine? Katherine? You need to get out. Katherine you need to get the fuck out. Oh God, fuckin' get out! Come on. - Get the fuck out! - What, what? - Go. - Okay. Come on, out! What? What? We're talking about our triggers. Triggers? Triggers are the things that make you wanna use. I, I don't understand. Is there anything that you find that happens before you want to use? What about your family? Do they ever stress you out? Or responsibilities? Friends? Friends? I don't have friends anymore. Okay. Why don't we move on? Louise. Um, Katherine? My friends. What about your friends? What about your friends Katherine? Janice. Janice was your friend? That was one of your friends, Janice? Do you miss her? Janice. Thank you Katherine. That was good. That was very good. Thank you. Okay, Louise? So are you staying? I guess so. At least for now until the snow melts. That's good. Where is Dana? She's not feelin' so great. Sorry. She's never had it easy. And everything that she does there's like these forces acting against her. She's always been there for me. Sometimes when stuff is really bad I'd, be gone for days, sometimes weeks. Nowhere, no one, nothing. And when I'd come back she'd be there for me. Oo. She never got angry, never got upset. I felt really bad. Shouldn't have done that to her. You must really love her. Yeah, I do. So what about you? You got a husband? Boyfriend? Or whatever? No. I mean, I was married but, didn't work out. Sorry to hear that. Mm. He was a good man. You know? Always wanted to help. Wanted to be there for me. But, married life just wasn't for me, and everything changed when I got rotated back home so. Anyway , I'm off to bed. See ya. Night. Hey and uh, thanks. Oh yeah, I brought a whole carton. Uh, no not for the cigs. For this morning. Yeah, sure. No problem. Okay, night. Hello? Hello? Hey. Is somebody out there? Hey, don't fuck with me. Jesus, I am out of shape. Wake up. Wake up everyone. It's time to wake up. Good morning Meg. Hey, time to get up. Beth? Beth, time to get up. Beth? Beth? Beth? She might've run off uh, but I don't know how far she'd get in this blizzard though. I guess it's possible but she left all her stuff. If she wanted to leave I don't see why she'd run out in the middle of the night. She coulda just asked to leave today, it would've been much easier. Addiction isn't always about what's easy. What do we do? Well first of all, we don't talk about this with the other patients. You just go along as you normally would. I'll see if I can get Lovell to find Beth. Should we call her family? The police? Let's hold off on that okay Jessica? Let me see if uh, Lovell can turn her up. Where's Beth? We have to uh, respect patient confidentiality. What the fuck? Did she go home? Louise, we have to respect... She would've fuckin' told me if she went home. This is bullshit. What the fuck happened to her? Louise, I'm sorry I can't... So what? You got Beth tied up somewhere or something you crazy fuckin' bitch? Oh, at least she got a shot in. What, you got nothin' to say? Huh? Huh? Ronnie, I would like to talk to you. Are you feeling better? Did you black out last night? Yeah. Are these black out episodes a normal occurrence for you? Normal? Do they happen often? When did they first begin Ronnie? The last time we talked you said you saw a man. Did you see him again last night? Uh, yeah. Who is he? He was someone I killed off base. But, he was innocent. Just, just, the wrong place at the wrong time. I see. It's okay Ronnie. It's okay. - It's okay. - No, not it's not okay. He's dead because of me. I know. And what you guys go through over there, it's not easy dealing with an experience like that and when you come home if there's not proper support... There's no shame in it. A lot of vets turn to narcotics to numb their pain. Did your brother? Yes. When he got back he did. He was very torn up. And that's what you think of me? That I do drugs to forget what I saw? That's what I'm expected to say? It's an easy explanation. Everyone gets it. Everyone sympathizes. War was awful. This country chewed you up and spit you out and now I'm just another forgotten soldier. You're supposed to say what you feel. I'm just saying from my experience working with veterans I found... I loved it over there. I left my nowhere hometown and got to see the world. I fought. I fought and I won. I had real friends. Friends who would've died for me. The friends who I would've died for. I had a purpose every day. And then I came here. And what's here? Nothing. Nothing means anything here. Beth? Beth? Where are you? Beth? Beth? Beth? Beth? Beth? Beth? Oh my God. Yes sir, thank you. Okay. I understand, I understand. Thank you officer. Yeah. Mm hm. Thank you very much. Are the cops coming? When the road's plowed. And how long will that take? It's unclear. The, the county's been really screwed by this blizzard. What about administration? Can't they do something? Come in. Ronnie please come and sit down. Lovell, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Ronnie uh , when's the last time you've seen Beth? Uh, I don't know. Do you know what happened to Beth? Hm? I don't. You don't? You don't know? You don't remember? Uh... Like you don't remember hitting her? Are you sure? Take your time and think, hm? Where'd you get that shiner? You, you didn't have it last night. She says she doesn't remember. I'm asking Ronnie. I don't remember. Ah, so somehow it happened during the night I guess huh? Yeah, I guess so. Well when the police come they're going to ask you questions. If you would like to call your family or a lawyer now, feel free to do so. I just wanna go back to my room. Okay. You can go. Am I a suspect? Thank you for your cooperation. Uh uh. You stay. Oh fuck. What did I tell you to do? I know. I'm sorry, I just wanted to try and help. And now Beth is dead because of that. So tell me Jessica, what do we do now? What do we do? I'm sorry. Did I ask for an apology? But right. You never listen to me when I tell you somethin'. This is on you. I did everything to prevent this from happening but no, you had to have Ronnie, Ronnie killed Beth? And I don't see any other likely possibility do you? You will face criminal charges and so will I. We knew what she was capable of. We knew how dangerous she was and we didn't kick her out when we should have. We didn't restrain her. God damn it! You know we'll be lucky if the lawsuits shut this place down and put everybody out of work. That is indeed the best case scenario we can hope for. Hey? Hey? Here. You havin' a good time? Don't. I'm just askin' a friendly question. Are you having a good time? Not right now, no. Louise get the fuck out of my way or else I'm gonna... Oh, or else what? You gonna kill me like you killed Beth? I know what you did you fuckin' cunt. Guys hey, back away from each other. Hey, get off. You piece of shit! Girls get back, each of you stop it. Dana, come back. Shit. You two stay right here. I'll be right back. Come on. Hey, what are you doin'? Doctor Taylor? Oh. Sorry. Jessica, where is everybody? I put them into separate rooms and told them to stay put. Oh, that's a good idea. Thank you. Louise? What do you think you're doin'? Gonna go watch some TV. Oh, I'm afraid you can't do that. Why the fuck not? Because we really need you to stay in your room. And if I don't? All right Louise, what's the problem? Well I... What the fuck? Come on! Is anyone else in here? Are you alone? Hey? Hey, hey, hey what happened? What happened? Are you okay? It's okay. You're okay. What happened? Katherine? Hey Tina? Oh my God. Why did you do it? What? Why? Why did you do it? What are you talking about? You killed them. I told you, I didn't kill anybody. I don't know what happened to Beth. You did it. You did it. Beth, Lovell, Tina. It was you. Doc, what are you talking about? I've been here with Katherine for the last hour. Katherine, Katherine is this true? What? Has Ronnie been here for the last hour or so? What? Have you been alone at any time tonight? Alone? Hey, hey? Doc, what's goin' on here? Ronnie did this? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Of course she did this. She says she was with Katherine. But the timeline is muddled. I don't know if it was her or not. What do we do? I want you to call the police again, okay? I don't give a shit about the blizzards or the roads. You tell them they get over here now and then you call administration and you tell them what happened. And until the cops arrive? I'll think of somethin'. I'll think of somethin'. Can I have your attention please? At this time, we're going to need everyone to return to their separate rooms. You will get your Suboxone and your meds but only when you return to your room. What the hell is goin' on? What is all this? Go to your rooms, no come for a group meetin', no go back to your rooms. How 'bout an explanation? I mean maybe we can help. We are all adults. Thank you for your feedback Louise but, we do have it under control uh, what we really need is for you to return to your rooms now. I'm not goin' anywhere until you tell us why. Very well. It appears that Tina has died in her room. We don't know if there was any fowl play. It may have been an accident. But it looks like someone else was with her. There was a piece of evidence - left in Tina's room - What the fuck? and we now have that evidence in our possession. The authorities are on their way and when they arrive we will give them this evidence. Without a doubt it will point whoever else was there so, if that person would like to step forward at any time, it could help clear things up perhaps. But if not, we can only assume their guilt, and when the authorities arrive, they will be charged with murder. Now I have to go to my office and call Tina's family. I need you all to return to your room and remain there until the authorities arrive, that's it. This meeting is over. Hm? Oh, fuck man. Um, are you okay? Can you walk? Blasted phone. Dr. Taylor? What is it Meg? Dana just threw up in the hallway. We need our meds now. Yeah just not now. I need my pills. Not now Louise. Fuck that. I need 'em now. What the fuck are you doing? That's my wife. Fuck your wife. I need my pills. Look, just give me my pills, I'll go back to my room. Apologize to her, now. You little piece of shit! Fucking! Meg? I'm sorry. What's going... Katherine no. Meg! Why did you do that? You, you killed them. She hit you. So you kill her? You kill both of them? I didn't want you to be a part of this. A part of what? What, what are you talking about? I have some bad habits, other then just the junk. It was you? I'm sorry. Beth and Tina too? I'm sorry. How long has this been going on for? I don't know. How long? I, I don't know. Two years, three? I don't know. You, you don't know? How can you not? I thought I could stop it, I thought that we would with coming here and I, I bullied into it that I could control it. If you can't control it why haven't you killed me? I would never hurt you. There's no me without you. What are we gonna do? They all saw you. When the blizzard ends the cops are gonna be here tonight. I'm not gonna let you go to jail. They all saw me Dana. I can't lose you. Then I'm gonna need your help. What's the fucking problem? It's frozen shut. What the fuck? You'll hurt yourself. There's gotta be another way out. It's the only way, and it'll work. Everyone thought it was her anyway so them trying to take her away will be tied up. If no one is alive there's no one to say otherwise. Just us. We'd be the only survivors of Ronnie's massacre. Everyone? I need you. Come on. Where? Kitchen. You need something. Where are we going? I don't know. To hide. Aren't there any weapons in this place? Nothing. Fuck! Shh. They'll hear us. Did you hear that? Come on, they can't have gotten far. They must be close. Shit! What? - What? - Shh, shh, shh. - What? - Katherine, you have to be quiet. What? What? What? Shut up? She has to be quiet. They're there. Shh. Okay. Let's move on. Are you okay? Is there a first aid kit somewhere? What are we gonna do with her? If she does that again she'll get us killed. Yeah, she's not fast either. I know. Fuck. I was hoping there'd be more weapons here. You got a baton. Knives Jessica? Scissors? Something that can kill? Stand back. What are you doing? Improvising. When I say go we run okay? Okay. Take these. Careful. Run. And now, careful with it. Always hold the duct tape end, never the glass end. Never put it down your pants or your pocket or anything like that or you'll cut yourself. Now listen, we find these guys and we get into it with them, keep your distance. I want you to swipe at them. Try and slash them, cut them. I'm gonna stab. You get the on the ground, don't go for the chest. You'll hit the breastplate, It'll hurt like hell but it's not lethal. Go for the carotid artery, here, or the stomach. Under the armpit's good too. Lots of vital organs there, but if you get a chance to stab, be sure to hit 'em a lot. Quantity over quality here. Any questions? Katherine you're okay. It's oh, it's oh... Hey what's wrong? I think it's her withdrawal pains. She needs her Suboxone. And where is that? In Dr. Taylor's office. Is it gonna help her shut up? It should. All right. Let's go. How many more. I don't know. I don't know, I don't know. Shelter. Did you hear that? What was it? What did you hear? Okay. Okay. You're hearing things. Okay. Okay? Let's head this way. Shit! Hide. Hide. Keep her quiet. How? Improvise. Help me, you gotta help me. They killed everyone. Not everyone. Shit. Fuck. What are we gonna do? Oh my God. Uh, where's the generator? It's in the basement, why? We have to get it turned back on. Do we have to? Isn't it easier just to hide in the dark? In the dark we're sitting ducks. All right. Follow me. Wait, wait. Do we all have to go? Can't me and Katherine just hole up somewhere? No, we stick together. If we get separated they pick us off one by one. We're safer together. Jessica, lead the way. Katherine. She needs her Suboxone. We have to get her to Dr. Taylor's office. Oh, yeah me too. I need some too. Okay you help her. We'll deal with the generator after. Carla here. You'll feel better, just take your meds okay? They're here. Sweet Jesus! We got to get out of here. Please! Ronnie come on. No. What? Leave your mace Jessica and your shiv. What are you doing? I'm staying. Please, we have... Have to what? Get out of here? And go where? We can hide until the police arrive. No one's comin' to save us Jessica. We kill them or we die. No one else is gonna do it. You don't have to put yourself through this Ronnie. You know what the biggest difference is between the people I fought over there and these two? I can look these two in the eye and know that they had it coming. I'd have given anything for that kind of certainty over there. I'll be fine. Don't worry about me, just get these two to safety. Hide in the isolation room. I'll come find you when I'm done. Okay come on, come on. Be careful. Ah! It's okay. Katherine? Katherine, it's okay. Are you alone? Let me the fuck in. What happened? Did you get them? Ronnie? I don't know. What? I blacked out. Got into a fight. I got sliced. My ribs hurt. I don't know what happened. What are we supposed to do? Just stay here and wait. I don't know, you have a better plan? You're the one. You said you were... What? I said I was gonna what? Kill them? She cut me. That bitch. God damn her. Baby. I'm gonna kill her. I'm gonna find her. No, I gotta get you to a hospital. They'll lock you up. I don't care about that, as long as you're all right. Let's, let's get you out of here. I'm sorry. For what? Accusing you, of killing everyone. I should've listened to you. Thanks. Are we safe? No Katherine. We're not safe. Get you to a hospital and they'll patch you up. You're gonna be okay. We can still make it. Get you to a hospital and we're, we're gonna get you patched up and you're gonna be okay. We're gonna make it. Ronnie, Ronnie stabbed you. It's the truth. Isn't it? And she, she, and then it was, it was, it was self defense. And, and when we fought back it was self defense. Please. Please don't do this to me. Come on you fucking bitch! Come on, come on you fucking... Was that Meg? At least I got one of 'em. What? Dana's dead. Meg's coming for us. But you said you didn't know what happened. That's a widow's scream. How can you tell? I've heard it before. We need to be ready. I'll take care of her. Ronnie! No! Run! She's dead Jessica. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I'll go get help. I'll go get help Ronnie, I'll... Jessica, it's too late. Bullshit. You said you've been through worse. Ronnie you said that. You said that. I was wrong. You did good Jessica. You did good. You'll be okay. You'll be good. You take care of her. Ronnie! Ronnie? Ronnie? Stay, stay, stay awake. Stay with me! Ronnie? Stay awake. Ronnie! Hi Katherine. How are you today? Are you doing good? Yeah. That's good. No more nightmares? That's good. I'm really glad to hear that. I know we've talked about it before, but do you think that you're ready to try attending group today? Group? Group therapy. Do you think you're okay to, to talk about what happened? To Ronnie? Yes. To Ronnie. Ronnie was my friend. I know. She was mine too. Do you think you can talk about her? Yeah. Good. Good. Come on. Let's go then. Subtitles by explosiveskull
