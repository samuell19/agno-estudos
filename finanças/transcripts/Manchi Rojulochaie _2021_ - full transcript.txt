Every man has inside him some amount of fear, along with rest of the emotions. But this guy Gundu Gopalam from Balaji Nagar Colony, Hyderabad... …is a little too paranoid. While some people trigger it unintentionally, …two idiots have trigger his paranoia with the sole intention to make his life hard. This story talks about how they ruined his life. Hey, kid! Hm. Looks like you’re writing something. Write something that'll benefit people, especially a guy like me. Hmm. Koti, look at him. I persuaded him this morning and he bought a 1 crore policy. He’ll have a blast when he’s dead. Huh! Why don't you buy a 1 crore policy too? Just do it, Koti. Stop it, man! First thing in the morning. Umm… You’ll know the value of policies once you’re dead. Did you do all the signatures? -Ok… -Hey, Mr. Gopalam! Hi, sir. Somebody's glowing like a firefly. You look so vibrant and jubilant all the time. Share your secrets with us, so that we can also smirink. No secret there. Anybody who has a daughter like mine tends to be happy. Even though she’s working in Bangalore… I don’t have to stress over her because she’s a woman of character. And that's more than any father in the world could ask for. I’ll leave. [mobile ringtone] Oh, speak of the angel. She doesn't go to work without video calling me first. Murthy, I want to vacate the house. But it's only been a week. But I can't bear the sight of Gopalam seeming so happy. Every time I see him, I’m jealous that I don’t have a daughter like his. It hurts, man. I can't watch him go about every day without the staple fear an Indian father has. Let's wipe that smile off his face. Huh? He doesn't deserve to be happy when you're not. Let's bring some sadness into his life. You think that's so easy? Of course. Remember when we were kids and we couldn't draw, …we would spoil others drawings. Yes. We splattered mud on Suresh's clothes when we fell into a mud pit. I know, right? Let's apply that here. We'll ruin his life, the life we couldn't attain. So true. "I was an ordinary guy" "You've made me feel special" "I was this solo guy, bored to death" "You've become the soul of my life" "And still not be able to take my eyes off you" "You could be pretty away from me" "And your glances would still hit me" "Oh, my cute little baby" "We're meant to be together" "We're two bodies breathing as one" "We're meant to be together" "We're meant to walk this path hand in hand" "I was an ordinary guy" "You've made me feel special" "I was this solo guy, bored to death" "You've become the soul of my life" "You're imprinted in my eyes and on my heart" "Let me kiss you gently on the lips" "I swear I'll never make you shed a tear" "I'll never let you go" "Oh, my cute little baby" "We're meant to be together" "We're two bodies breathing as one" "We're meant to be together" "We're meant to walk this path hand in hand" Yeah exactly, we need to check the… Paddu, did you check your mail? No. What is it? Don’t you know? -First covid case has been registered in India. -Oh my! We should go back to our hometowns and work from home. Who says so? Our OCD boss? Yup. He’s witnessed the seriousness in the US before coming here. So, he's shooing us off out of paranoia. Why are you so beaten about it? It’s good news. How so? I can have you all for myself when you’re here. When you're back home, you should give time for your family. Still, I'll make time for you, right? Ok? Hurry. We don’t want to miss the flight. If his daughter too falls in love. We’ll show him hell. Why did you call me so urgently? Oh, you’re here. Sit down. I’ll tell you. Yes, sir? He also has a wife and 2 daughters just like you do. And his eldest one is working software in Bangalore. Just like your daughter. Er… So what? So what? He sent her to a different city for the job. Hmm. All those thirsty boys… why wouldn't they pursue her? One of her colleagues is giving him sleepless nights. He used to have drinks with me every night. Now he drinks sanitizer from a bottle to beat the stress. What the hell! Why would he drink sanitizer? Moreover, if she really likes him, why don't they get married? Gopalam, it's foolish of us to think software guys are soft in nature. You don't know how wild they can get. And when such wild guys come cross beautiful prey like our daughters, …the hunt is on! When some wild guy starts chasing your daughter, …you’ll know what Koti’s going through. I wouldn't wish that for my daughter. Moreover, I have a weak heart. Just the thought of it can give me a heart stroke. You seem so anxious. Do you know if your daughter's in love with somebody? Ah…No chance! It's my daughter we're talking about. That's what I assumed. Look at me now. I don't know if you're giving me a heads up or trying to scare me. Gopalam! He just doesn’t want you to end up like him.` [mobile ringtone] What timing! My daughter’s calling. You know why? To let me know that she's unlike Koti's daughter… And that she'll not put me through that trauma. Hello, dear. Yes, dad. I just landed. Get a cab and come safely. Send me the cab details before you hop in. tsk! You can't trust these boys. Don't worry about it, dad. I'm not coming alone. My colleague is joining me. Great! I'll see you. Good… Is she coming home? Yes. Her colleague's joining her. Are you saying it's a girl? Er…may be. Why do you look skeptical? Is that doubt that I'm sensing in your tone? Say yes. Say it. Yes. Now tell me exactly what your daughter told you. She told her colleague's joining her. So, it could be a boy or a girl. - Hmm. She took the escapist route by not being gender specific. What say, Koti? Absolutely. Ah? My daughter would also speak vaguely whenever that guy was with her. Yes, dad? How far along are you, dear? Um…Gachibowli. We're almost there. Why don’t you invite your female colleague home for dinner? It's okay, dad. She's not that hungry. She had something on the flight. What did she eat that it's keeping her so full? Never mind, dad. I don't want to bring her home right now. There's a right time and occasion for it. Otherwise, she'll get bored of our food. I don't know, dear. I can never fully comprehend what you speak. Alright. See you. Sir, did that clear all your doubts? No. In fact, they just multiplied. It's a female colleague. That’s what you believe. Not us. If it was a ‘her’, she’d have put her on the phone. Instead, she came up with lame excuses. Your daughter's insinuating something romantic. She's an urban kid, after all. Software! Is that so? Yes, sir. Even my daughter would speak indirectly. I'd never understand her intention. I went to a Telugu medium school like you did. Don't relate everything to me, sir. You're rubbing off on me. One more thing. Unlike your daughter, mine doesn't lie. No way! He’s caught. Gopalam, daughters don't lie to us deliberately. It's just their attempt to not stress us out. We're talking about love here. It makes you do things. When she's with her guy, he's her world. She does whatever he says. Been there. Done that. Stop it, sir! I've never done anything like that. Is my daughter really bringing home a guy? That's what we think. If we turn out to be right, …he's not going to drop her home on time. He'll make your daughter call you with some lame excuse like her car breaking down. Your phone's ringing. Answer it. Hey, dear. Dad, our car broke down. We’ll be late. Do you believe us now? Dear, put your female colleague on the phone. Why, dad? Let me talk to her once. Give me that. She's on another call. Busy, huh? Stop it, sir! Talk to her. I'll wait, dear. Put her on the phone immediately. Why are you getting so worked up, dad? Like I'm doing something wrong. She used those words because she knows she's wronged. Will you put her on the phone or not? I need to talk to her right now! Alright! Talk to her! Hello! Hello! -Hello! -Can you hear me, dad? Yes, I can hear you. -Dad! She can do, too. But she's playing. Dad, the reception's bad. But I can hear you. Hello! Hello! Did she hang up? Say yes. Say yes, Gopi. Yes. Let's go have chai. -Let’s go. -Come on, Koti. Throwing stones in the dark. Sir! I don’t get what’s happening there. What's not to get? Hm? It's getting dark. A guy and a girl are travelling together. And they're a couple. It's the perfect opportunity to do things they can't in public. Why would they waste it? They'll send the driver off to eat, …and have a few snacks on their own. They'll roll the windows up, …turn on the AC and …sit up or lie down as per their comfort. My daughter's done that. Your daughter will too. No way! Let's move. Hey! Come on. Stop it. Why did you stop the car here? Driver wanted to grab a bite. Oh, really? I know who wants to grab a bite. Then why don't you let me? I’ll break your face. No, listen. I don't know when I'll see you again. If they announce a lockdown, I'll be doomed. You know my love language is touch. Santhu, let's get out of here first. My dad will kill me if I'm late. He's already skeptical. Please, Santhu. Let's go. This is what I hate. I would've kissed you by now. Come on! Is this the place to do it? I don't care. Are we kissing or not? Hey, don't be stubborn. I'm really nervous. Driver, come on! Start the car. Will my daughter say yes to his proposal? No. No. You've called her enough times to build tension. She’ll cut him off, rush home and call you. There it is. Answer it. Hmm! Hello. Hello, dad. Yes, dear. Car didn't break down. It's just a flat tyre. We're on the way. Don't you worry. It's all good here. And she hangs up. Am I right, Gopalam? Thank god, nothing happened. Mr. Gopalam, don't relax as of yet. That guy won't drop it so easily. He won't let her out of the car without kissing her. Same experience! I'll see you. Yeah, sure. Why do you look so dull? That's just my face. Your father's waiting. Go! Go! Sir, should I get down? No need. Madam's leaving. Smile before I go. Ma'am, should I get down? I said that's not necessary. What are you looking at, sir? He won't let her go until he's satisfied. Stop it, sir! She won't do something like that in public. Not when the cab driver is in the front seat. That is why they sent him away. [singing a sensuous song] I can't get myself to believe that. I don't think my daughter will do that. I didn't either. But girls get easily influenced. Stop it! I won't be a mere spectator here. I'll find out if she's really with a guy. Yeah, right. Come in the morning. Dad will be out. We'll spend some quality time, okay? No way! I deserve a kiss, at least for sending him away. Here you go! Why don't you smile and do it? Please. Not happening! You can't get your way all the time. -Umm… -Ah? Let's go! Huh? Ah? My dad! Hey! Bring a water bottle. Idiot ruined it! Daddy! How are you? You've lost weight. Did you miss me? Oh, dear! Hold on. Dad! Dad, where are you going? Wait dear. Your friend has come this far. -Let me offer her a glass of buttermilk. -Dad! -She doesn’t drink buttermilk. -Dear… Open the door. Why did she shut it? She's going through depression, dad. Let it go. I can’t leave her alone. That’s not right. Hold on. Dad! Dad, let it go! Whoa! You said she's depressed. She seems pretty solid to me. Great sir. She's really depressed. Hold on. Hello, dear. Will you open the door or should I break the glass with my head? Dad, you'll hurt yourself. Open the door! Come on, dad. Step back! Driver, go. Dad! Dad! Dad, let her go! She's depressed! Dad! Is that a man's shirt? They're man's pants as well. She's a tomboy. Huh? Let's go, dad. Almost got me there! Bloody baldy! You see how she's cooking up lies? This is nothing. I've seen the guy put on his pants. Sir, I've heard enough of your experience. My head's so hot right now; You could make an omelette on top of it. Listen Gopalam. We should check her phone. That'll cool you down. Her phone? But why? Because his messages will be on it. Yes! We should figure out how deep into this they are and save our little girl. Did you check your daughter's phone too? Don’t tell me. I don’t want to listen to that shit. It gives me boils. Er…I’ll check her phone. You can leave now. He's done for! Mom! You're home! I'm experimenting with a dessert and making it savoury for you. She experimented with curd and thumbs up the other day and made me drink it. My stomach's still recovering from it. Stop it, dear. Nikki, click a picture. I'll post it on the group. Take it! Nikki, hold on. Sister's phone has better clarity; You can literally smell the dish. Give me your phone, dear. It's a big one. Which company? It's an iPhone, dad. What's the password? It doesn't need a password. Oh! Face unlock. Here. Safety comes first, huh? I guess. Nikki will click pictures in the meantime. Go take a shower. Okay! Yeah, you should eat this hot. -Come fast. -Okay. Yeah, your mom’s right. Holy shit! That was close. Phone's with dad. Will he check my texts? Dad! Dad! Just a minute. -I have to make an urgent call. -Sure. Thank god, it's all deleted! If your dad messes with me one more time, I swear I’ll break his head. If he keeps giving me scares, I’ll silence him forever, no kidding. Hello. Finally, you're in the mood to talk? Whatever. What was that text? Why? Didn't you read it? I deleted it because dad was right there. Hmm. You missed witnessing how aggressive I can be. Whatever. My phone was in my dad’s hand. I'm kind of nervous that he might've read it. Did he say anything? tsk! He wanted to click some pictures. It kind of hit me suddenly that you might text. So, I ran back to him and grabbed the phone. What's to worry then? Your dad could never read such a long text so soon. And you know how good he's at English. Hello! Don't say that about my dad. And don't send me those texts, please. Yeah, whatever. Are you still upset with me? What can I do? You don't even kiss me on the phone. You're hopeless! So desperate, I tell you! Tick this box. Shh! Patients! Patients! Thank god! They're gone. Why are you acting like a bunch of goons are chasing you? What's wrong? Goons are way better. They kill you at once. But these patients, I tell you, they're behind you for appointments. And once they get it, they trouble you. Come on! They can't be that bad. You'd be surprised. Even if it’s just a common cold, they show me hell for it. All silly questions, I swear. They act like doctors after watching a few YouTube videos. They take it another notch by acting meek and then getting second opinions. Do they consider that opinion at least? No. If there's any job in the world that's the most disrespectable, It's the job of a doctor. They call us frontline warriors and then make us fear for our lives. Hello. Hey, you piece of shit! Where the hell are you? Hello. Who's speaking? Devil! Satan for you! Vetapalem Rowdy! Man, I have a really bad temper. Don't irk me. Hey! But your texts irked me. Why the hell would I text you? Not me. You’re texting my daughter. I'm the father of Padma Thirumalashetty. Gopalam Thirumalashetty speaking. Hey! Did you just threaten me? Uncle, I sent that text in a fit of rage. I’m sorry. Let it go. Anyway, it was wrong of you to read that text. And moreover, I don't like your tone. We'll talk tomorrow. Let it go. Let it go, my foot! My angel's lying to me now because of you. How dare you lecture me on what's right and wrong! I will. You think what you did is right? Being a girl’s father, sneaking into her phone and personal space… …spying on her, while acting all innocent on the front… Are you saying this is all right? You learn it first. Learn how to raise a mature girl and grow as a father. You don't tell me how to grow. Hey! If you mess with my daughter ever again… Hello… Hello, master! I'm not a kid anymore to fear you. You'll break trying to control us. He's going to knock you down, you hear that? Hey! Hey! How dare you! Your parents did a really sucky job with you. Uncle! Don't bring my parents into this. You're forcing me to get rid of you and take over your house as your daughter's husband. Officially! Take care! Hey! We're done! I can't fake respect for you any longer. Hang up right now! Gopalam, my guy was way better. He cursed me in English, something like fuck off, and hung up. Your guy seems wild. Gopalam, he's really dangerous. He'll not leave your daughter alone. He'll humiliate you. You're in trouble, Gopalam. My heart's getting heavier. Gopalam is done for. Now let’s go. [mobile ringing] -Hello Paddu! -Santhu, call me in the morning. I’m sleeping. No, Paddu. Listen to me. Gopalam… You shouldn't take his words to heart. Think about what to do next. What can I do, sir? I'm afraid of doing anything right now. Did you tell your daughter what happened? No. Did he tell her? I have no clue. Dad! Hot water's ready. Oh! So she doesn't know yet. Is it? How can you tell? If she knew, she wouldn't be so cool right now. She'd have jumped on her bed, pulled a sheet over her head and called him. Out of guilt, of course. Oh! So you've seen it all? Absolutely! How do I deal with him then? Guys like him will only fear a cop. Did you approach the police? Of course. What happened? Find out for yourself. Let's find out right now. Should I file a case for abusing you or for harassing your daughter? I just know that I don't want him anywhere near me or her after this. I want to beat him with your baton, have him press my feet and kick him out of my life. Forever! Alright. I'll make it happen, as a police officer. But, think about it. He didn’t spare his future father-in-law. If I bring him over, he'll definitely develop a grudge. He'll turn into a psycho. What if he tries to murder you through hit men? What if he pours acid on your head? Think about your safety, your family. Forget about the family. Think about yourself. Acid peels your skin off and literally pushes your eyeballs out of the sockets. Imagine how horrendous you'll look. I'd pee my pants. Sir, just a minute. Look, Gopalam. You peed your pants just at the thought of it. Can you handle me bringing him down to the station? I thought you'd solve the problem, sir. But you're scaring me. That's not his intention, Gopalam. He just wants you to be practical. Just telling you how things are. What did he tell you? The exact same thing. Why did you bring me all the way then? You could've told me back home. Gopalam, don't make a fuss. Don't lose your temper. Sir has more to say. You continue. Gopalam, nobody is timid anymore. We hesitate to do a drink and drive test on a motor biker. When it's a guy who sincerely loves a girl, we're really helpless. Tell yourself that you're hopeless. -That was my feeling back then. -You… He cussed me really badly, sir. Of course. But he cussed you when you called him. And you were the one who was drunk. Not him. Tomorrow if he says that you provoked him to say those words, …you’ll be put behind bars. Hm? Usually, you show a guy here as an example. Where is he? He's also a sufferer, just like you. He came to file a case on his daughter's lover. But her lover complained that her father is the real threat and got him locked up. tsk! Look Gopalam! This is a family matter. Don't bring the police and public into this. You better resolve it within 4 walls. They’re in love. Get them married. No, sir. I can't have my daughter marry him and live a life of fear. I can’t! I have an idea, Gopalam. Tell your daughter about your problem, …and get her married to someone who’ll become your strength. Be happy! I'll do that, sir! Yes! -Brother… -You shut up! I’ll do that, sir! Hello! Why didn't you call back in the morning? It's not like you're busy. I thought you’d call me once you wake up. Hmm. I can’t sleep in peace when your dad’s at my neck. Huh? What did my dad do in your sleep? Not in my sleep. Didn't he tell you anything? About what? Did he see you this morning? Yeah. I heated water for him. How did he look? Pissed or cool? He looked cool as usual. Why? Alright. I'm near your place. Come out. Okay. Give me 2 minutes. Gopalam! Yes! Come sit. -Yes, mom. -Hey! Granddaughter’s home. Get her married right away. It’s already late. I knew your mom would also say this. Don’t take credit for everything. Leave some stuff to us. -Mom! -Hmm. I was going to discuss the same. She has to be home for it, right? She would be home, of course. Who knows? We were going to discuss with his daughter back then as well. His wife came out and said that she left with her colleague. Your wife might say the same now. Dear, Paddu went out with her colleague. She asked me to tell you. Ah? What did I say, huh? Sir. How come you’re predicting everything like some monk? -Hey! - Ah! It’s about the vote, right? I have voting rights. Um…Who the hell mentioned that now? We’re talking about who she left with. Don’t interfere, you deaf lady! Hey! Don’t yell. I’ll vote for your candidate. You don’t have to bribe me. You… guys are driving me crazy! Sir… The next step would be to start feeling nauseous. The thought of your daughter leaving with somebody should make you run to the restroom. He won't have that in common with you, Koti. Looks like I will. Huh? Oh my! Same to same. Holy shit! No. I don’t want to be late. I didn’t tell my dad I was coming. I should get back before he gets home. Why don't I drop you right now? Come on! Don't be so pissed. You're getting really short tempered recently. Why not? You're nagging a lot these days. Excuse me. I was just giving you a heads up that we can't be out long. You're losing your cool instead of trying to understand. Why am I losing my cool? Because of you. You're supposed to calm me down. Alright. You have an hour. Stick to that. This hour's mine. Don't say a word no matter where I take you or whatever I do. I will. About a few things. I don't have any expectations from you. Awww! Dear, have curd with fenugreek. It will stop? What? My breath? Ah, no! Diarrhoea. Your tips can't stop it. The best you can do is keeping Paddu from going out. But, what's the harm in going out with her colleague? Stop it! He's causing all the trouble. When she wanted to go out, why didn't you come to me first? Who gave you the authority to send her? Gopalam, you'll have high BP if you keep yelling. Murthy, I had more than just BP. Headache, dizziness, sweaty palms, stiff nerves and nausea. Yeah! Holy shit! I feel all of it already. My head's getting sweaty. Gopalam, don't sweat it. I'll have an ambulance at the ready. Ambulance?! How come it showed up so fast? Did something happen to me? Are you not telling me? Who's this idiot? Why is he hopping and spilling jasmines? Hey! You saw the board and you know it’s not me. Why do you even bother asking? You look like a patient. I have space in the back for you. You want to come? You're talking like it's a share cab. It’s an ambulance, damn it! You can’t just take me in. Call them and find out the correct address. If you enquire every time you see a bald head, the patient will surely die. Damn right! Will meet again. Okay, uncles. Bye! Meet again? Look at him! He's bad omen, man. Is it a sign that I'm going to die? Ah! That feeling is kicking back in. Hey... Stop! Stop! What? One cornetto, please. If you waste this one hour and spare me no time… I won't do that. You can have me. Ah! Dear, she's not picking up. Maybe she’s on the bike. And there’s the loud traffic. Call her again. She wouldn’t answer otherwise. Don’t be stupid. Ah? After last night, he must be planning his revenge. What say, Koti? Of course. Undoubtedly. Yes! If you ask me, they must have gone to some registrar office to get married. Hm? Or they must've gone to Kodaikanal for a week to have fun. Dear, check if the gold and cash is intact. Did your daughter take all of it while leaving? I'll tell you once she checks. Not right now. Don't be a tease. You're not helping me anxiety at all. Gopalam, don't be so whiny. You'll have chest pain. Hmm… See? Your heart's beating faster. Feel it. Come on. It's rapid. You're right. I feel some pain in the area. Bro, I'm still here. You want to get in? Didn't you leave yet? Dear, she picked up. Where are you? Who are you with? If you don't come home straightaway, I'll have a heart stroke. Dad, this is Nikki. Holy shit! Oh my! Did you leave as well? Who's the guy? Which grade is he in? Dad, Paddu left her phone at home. -She forgot her phone. -Yes. She forgot her phone. I don't believe it. How come? She left it behind on purpose. She broke all ties with you and left home. She bade adieu. Dad! Listen, dear. I know that you came back for the phone. But, there's something that you need to know. This phone isn't just a device. It's something that keeps you safe. When you were born, I was scared for your safety. My mom told me to put my faith in God and everything will be fine. That was it. I walked all the way to Tirumala, sacrificed my tresses to Lord Balaji… …and prayed for your safety. Since then, every time hair grew back on my head, I'd fear something might happen to you. That is why I get my head shaved at Tirupati every 2 weeks till date. When some guy lures you onto the wrong track… …and tries to play with my life, why would Lord Balaji watch in silence? That is why he made you forget your phone. He brought you back to me. Dad, you got the wrong impression of Santosh. He's a really good guy. Silly girl! You know something? Everybody on this planet thinks their lover is a nice person initially. As time passes by, they see their true colors and regret ever knowing them. Dad, Santosh is nothing like that. If you could meet him once… That won't be necessary. We had an argument on the phone already. He didn’t tell you what happened last night? Why would he? He must have asked things like… ‘Did you wake up?’ ‘Did you shower?’ ‘Which soap, perfume do you use, baby?’ ‘What did you have for breakfast?’ He asks all the rubbish He didn’t tell you about cussing your dad, did he? He sent you a text, right? Why are you acting like you haven't read it? I swear on you, dad. I haven’t read that text. -I’ll talk to him right now. -Hold on. I know what he'll say. He'll use his drinking as an excuse and apologize. You'll forgive him and fall right into his arms. Back to square one. When he has managed to manipulate you into cheating your own father, …turning things in his favour would be pretty easy for him. Huh? Dear, your dad's really worried about you. Get married to the guy he decides. -He’ll be strong. -Hmm. Otherwise, he'll be shattered. Yes, dear. You’re matching up to my daughter in all aspects. But, get married to the guy he finds for you. Because, you can’t forget your phone every single time, …and come back to save him. So, that's the story. The girl, who went to get her phone back, actually ended up blocking her boyfriend. Her lover went nuts trying to figure out what happened. No surprise there. Man, stop calling him her lover. It sounds like a cuss word when you say it. So, her lover… Got you! Whatever. So, unless and until you talk to Paddu, …tell her about the fight and make her unblock you, …you’re not going to drink with us, is it? Not as easy as you make it sound. Ah? Her dad's been home all morning. So… I don’t have the looks to attract the heroine. But I have the brains to lure the father out. But how? [mobile ringtone] Hello. Hello, is it Bald Gopalam? It’s not Bald Gopalam. It’s Thirumalashetty Gopalam. Some Gopalam, sir. What is it? Do you recognize me, sir? It's Lakshmi. Vijaya Lakshmi. I make papads in your colony. How would I know? The ladies might. I'm kind of tensed right now. Call me later. Sir… I’m tensed too. I was waiting at the bus stop to get back home… And the auto drivers here are ogling at me. What? Come help me out, sir. I'm in a red saree, blouse less… Oops. I’m standing in a sleeveless blouse, looking all sexy. Please come, sir. What are you doing there in the wee hours, dressed skimpily? Huh? Is it my fault that I'm beautiful, sir? Please come, sir. I'll hold. Okay. I'm coming. You can go now. Field is clear. Why wouldn't they ogle if you put all your assets on display? Ah? I've been looking in the entire colony for you. You got upset with mom for not feeding you and came here to chitchat with someone? He'll get caught. He's done for. Hey, mister. Sir! Please come fast. -Hello… -Let go of my hand! -Hey, you… What's wrong? Sir, he’s trying to snatch my suitcase key. You'll become the target if something happens to me. Because, last call from my phone was made to you. Are you coming or not? Baldy! My heart beat! Come fast! Hold your horses, woman! Paddu, bring the clothes from terrace. Yes, mom! What are you doing here? How long should I wait there for you? I've been looking for you like a madman. Why did you block me? I’ll talk to you later. Leave. I'm not leaving. Come out this instant. Dad's home. No, he isn't. I've lured him out. Are you coming or no? Paddu, I'm being serious. If you don't come see me, I'll have to talk to your dad. I'm already pissed off. You don't want me near your dad right now. Go. I'll tell mom and come. Really? Hmm. Oh my! Hey, Papads Vijaya Lakshmi… Where are you? You were taking too long. So I rented a ladies bicycle and got a flat tyre. Ah… I came into the bushes with Syamala Rao to fix it. Why does that sound so shady to me? Ah, Syamala Rao! Sir, he's also messing with me. I knew it. This is what happens when you go into the bushes with strangers. You women are insane. You act all tough on the outside and fall for silly traps. Oh my! He's biting me, sir. Tell him to wait till I get there. Can't lose you like this. Which bushes are you in? Syamala Rao, you're so dead when my bald superhero gets here. Where are you, woman? Sir, hurry! Where are you? Ah… Holy shucks! Looks like there's a whole medical camp here. Hey, Papads Vijaya Lakshmi… Where are you? Hello! Why did you cuss my dad? How could you yell at him? Let me speak… After what happened last night in the car, I sent you an angry text. I thought you'd read it and delete it because you know me. How were I to know that he'll read it? How could I have imagined? He called from an unknown number and spoke shit. I asked who was calling. He then told me about the text and said all kinds of crap. And when he brought up my parents, I lost it. That's all. Nothing more to it. I knew he'd tell his version and make me the villain. Hide the reality from you. Look what happened now. Paddu! I’ll come apologize to him if you want. He's elder to me. I should've composed myself. I understand. I could even fall at his feet. I have no ego. Hm? Paddu, if you still think it's my fault… I'll accept whichever decision you make. Hey! Hmm. Let's go, baby. Listen to me. You've known me for so long. If you still listen to some version of me and block me… How do I come back from that, huh? tsk! I don't know what to do. He's been so fired up all day. He was forcing me to get married and I said yes. I was pissed with you, of course. It's not too late. I'll deal with that alliance. Please unlock me, baby. Please. Please. Sir, if he wants to talk to her… 2 minutes. Okay. Strategic Timeout 2 ½ minutes. Come on, boys! Strategic Timeout?! Don't tell me he plays the IPL. No. No. He has nothing to do with cricket. But I share a deep relationship. An illicit one. Don't pause there. We'll crack up. I've played every match there is and lost it all. Finally, I settled as an umpire. Out! Forget about him. What does the groom think of her? Does he like what he’s seeing? She’s shining like a leather ball in the 1st over. Any batsman on the pitch would love it. He'd love to hit it to a six. Whoa! He's a sweet talker. Should we discuss the dowry? Bargaining has begun. This is where his true character comes out. I'm getting to that. Whatever you want to give, gift it to the captains. Your daughter and my son. It could be a car, a house or all your assets in the form of cash. That's all good. What does the captain want? I don't want a single penny from her salary, uncle. She can buy me stuff, plan trips and surprises from her pocket. Oh! That's cool. What do you have to offer her? Free hugs and kisses. Long walks. Oh, my god! I'll increase her stature by announcing her as my wife. Basically, he's giving her nothing. [mobile ringtone] Sir, he called again. He did? I was just wondering how everything’s going so smoothly. Koti, he called. What do I do now, sir? Pick up and talk. I'll cut the call. He'll come home with a knife in his hand. Did your guy also bring one? What do you think? I hate puzzles! You’re screwing with my sanity. Sir, is it about the dowry? Why don't you talk in private? You can reach a decision quickly. Take the Strategic Timeout. Hello. Hello, uncle. Stop calling me that. What is it? What have you got to do with me? The next time you call, it'll be the CI on the phone. He's my neighbour. Watch it. Stop threatening me in the name of cops. Actually, why don't you put him on the line? What are you going to do, huh? I'll tell him how you're forcing Paddu into this marriage. And how the groom belongs to the Mafia of cricket betting. I'll prove that you're selling your daughter for a deal. Yes, Your Honor. They're like King Kong and Godzilla. They've confiscated my car, bungalow and coconut fields. I have the FIR filed at the SR Nagar Police Station. I'll forward it on Whatsapp. Check it out and reply. Not only that uncle. He's converting many cricket cards used by all as masks and selling them, your honour! Is it enough or you want anything else, uncle? What to do now? Cancel it! You… He's saying so conveniently by catching him right? Hey second umpire! How far did your strategic time come? Never mind a rupee. Come let's play the match first. My son decided to be strong in the next over. Betting master! Uncle! Is everything fine? Will you come with pad? Do you've guard? Ask him to keep it. Ask him to keep it. He came without a lingerie and was sitting here. We're dying to see Not that… Hey! You keep on hitting from down from the time you come. I'll rip your left hand out. After that you've to use only one hand alone. Out! Aah.. Happy! Dear! Go and change your dress. Hm. Dear! Hm? Sorry my girl. I'll never hurt you again making you sit like this. Ok? Dad! Yes dear. Next time… I'll search and bring their family home after I get the belief that you too like them. My sweet heart. Without resisting me you agreed to accept my word. It's enough. This satisfaction is enough for this birth. The satisfaction that won't come even if we earn crores, …comes when a girl with a nice character is born. Raising you with fear of not hurting you in anything from childhood, I used to love you a lot. Respecting that love, ...you accepted my decision and followed it without asking about him. It is enough, dear. It's enough! You're my mother who was born when my mother was alive. I'll never let you face any deficit. I'll bring you a better half who will never make you cry. By whom you'll be happy, by seeing whom I'll be courageous I'll bring that type of person as my son-in-law. - Hm. Ok? My dear! I'll bring, dear. I will! I'll bring him for sure. To your garden.. What…? A new lock. Did you see how he's reading? My dried leaves. Dried leaves! How nicely he was reading! [mobile ringtone] Rumours… Hello What's this? You went insearch of your son-in-law and stopped at him! I found a correct proposal I needed with the fear you caused to me ‘cause of that cricket match. The groom was just like me. Even though he wasn't educated, he looks after my daughter very well. You're thinking like that. Not everyone is like you. Now a days if a boy gets an educated girl, …inferiority complex develops in them and goes against wives, …by starting to prove themselves with the fear of female domination. He's so called less educated husband than wife. What's this? What type of sarees are these? What did I ask to drape and what you're draping? Did you see this belt? I'll kick you badly. What's that gaze? Do you think that your dad will do anything to me? Both of us are the same. We both are uneducated. No one can do anything to me. Because I'm uneducated. -Oh my! -Uneducated! Uneducated! Uneducated...! I'm uneducated. Dad! What is my fate? 111 in seventh grade. 1,2,3 in tenth grade. 111 in EAMCET. King of Ranks! What you want is an educated son-in-law like me. Highly educated person! You can tell it by seeing down also dear. Do you've to come to me and say? Stupidity. Arrogant that they are educated. Do you know how your daughter's life would be if he's her husband? Hey ranking of Eamcet! Neighbours are here. Go and see! Hey second class of Inter! Learn how to cook tastily. Adding education for every word that is so unnecessary, …he keeps on insulting your daughter everyday. Your well educated superiority complex son-in-law. Hello. I'm going to marry my daughter to a cop. For which courage people comes to the police station, I'm going to bring that courage to my home. So you want to give difficulties to her in the name of courage! Difficulties! I'm telling that I'm marrying her to a cop. Didn't you understand? You who scares to go the police station, you who dislikes to sit in the police station. A middle class father who scares just by seeing a police dress. Do you’ve the dare to handle a cop as a son-in-law? Take a look over there. If he shares the love that should be shared only with your daughter to everyone privately, …do you've the power to stop that? If you try to stop that, …what if your son-in-law occupies your house and throws you away in anger? If he experiments third and fourth degrees on you in this station.. [Scream..] Alas! God..don't hit me!! Alas! [Scream] Gopalam! What happened? You said that you're here to talk about a marriage proposal.. Yes dear. I'm here to call you for lunch for the Rakshabandhan as my daughter's brother. What? Are you here to invite for Rakshabandan which is after six months? You've to come for sure. You've to accept our hospitality and bless us all. That's our quest.. Quest...! Come, let's go. Err…I'll take leave. I thought of you as a bommarillu father. But you're a villian in Okkadu. You're taking revenge on your daughter by acting as you love her. How can I’ve hostility towards my daughter! The proposals you're seeing and the acts you're doing resembles that. Instead of marrying her with the person she loves. You’re wandering with a person as if there are good guys in every field except in software. Remember one thing uncle. The options you compare with me aren't as good as me. If you think to buy the best guys with the fear you have, ...your life is not enough for the money you have. If you want to choose your daughter, …she is also in a relationship with me for three years. If you hide this matter and marry her to any useless guy, …one day he will definitely comes to know about our love and reject her with a kid. Then the suffering you experience lasts for your lifetime. That’s why I’m telling you, …whether you will get your daughter married to someone you like and destroy her life for your temporary happiness- -or for will you marry your daughter with me feeling sad temporarily is your wish! What is this sir? Can't a middle class father bring a son-in-law who gives him courage? Should he have to live fearing for the rest of his life marrying her with someone? No other way Gopalam sir. I too couldn't bear this torture and wanted to take this sanitizer and commit suicide. Koti! Do you've sense? What is his situation and what are your words? Will you scare him by telling what had happened? Did you remember after your daughter’s marriage looks? You came here and got hurt while talking and suffered from a heart attack! You were saved, as the ambulance was on time. Hey! Stop...! [Hail Shiva] This is the correct location. Hello! I heard about a middle class father called Yedukondalu. Where would he live? What is this swamy? You reached here with address as soon as we thought. What he used to do? As far I know he's looking for marriage proposals to his daughter. Nothing is fixed yet. With the fear that he can't do anything now, he's attacked with a heart attack. Do you know, he got a heart attack? Do you know it…? Dad! I think it would be difficult now. How did it happen? Because of the guy you loved. With the fear he caused to him, …talking in phone since and spoiling all the proposals you got. He tortured him with his words and brought to the edge of his life. Did you see? Your love is killing your father. That's why we tell you all strictly. …not to love these type of guys and hurt our lives. You won't listen. Everything is our fate. Lift it dear. Answer! It might be him. Probably he came in search of you with the confidence that there will be no interruptions. Go. Take your dad and tell him that you’re going to marry the person who murdered him …and kill him completely. If he is still alive, …both of you take a pillow and kill him completely. It will be good. Go dear. Go! Go. Paddu! Are you crazy? Will you kill my dad? What did I do? What you've to do? You brought him to the edge of his death right? Paddu, you called all wrong. Shut up! I know what you did to him. Because I didn't accept to marriage looks, did you understand that I wanted to kill him? What is this killing? What are you talking about? What else? Why did you scare him like that? When did I scare him, paddu? I told him the facts! I told him that you can't get a son-in-law like you wish by your financial position, So I just asked him to understand us and accept our marriage. Isn’t it enough for his weak heart to hurt? Paddu, all these are general talks only. How can I know he gets heart stroke just by this? You have to know. Because he is not a person like all. He's very sensitive. He just seems strong, but it's not a normal fear he has in his heart. He has been tense from the time I'm in mother's womb about how to raise a girl. He is tensed whether I and my mom are safe or not at the time of delivery. Whether the teachers teach well or not if I go to school. If uncle attempts child abuse if he is in home. Not only one. Like this my dad raised me with fear everyday and minute. When everyone sees only his fear, I see his unconditional love towards me. That’s why when he rejected you, I blocked you in the next while without arguing. Because I love my dad so much. I even prefer you after my father. Do you know that? When you’ve so much fear that my dad will give me to someone just for three 3 relation, My dad will also have the fear about my love who grew me up for 25 years right? You have to understand that right? Listen, now I'm telling you. It is the heart that saved me day and night since my childhood. If anything happens to him, I'll never see your face again. "Seeing the invisible God within you" i "I'm living in your thoughts" "You're my hope and breath" "I keep on loving you" "Love is the thought that appears in eyes" "I fell in your illusion" "I'll be with you no matter how many births!" "You became the visible God" i "You adored every day I appear" i "It's enough if you're with me" i "I'll live throughout my life seeing you" i Cheers buddy. Buddy..Cheers! What man? Paddu scolded me and now her father is on treatment. Don't know what's happening there and there is no one to tell me. Getting scared that she will yell at me if I call her to know about the situation. Incase if anything happens to him, I don't know what my situation is. While these many are running in my mind, you're talking about the stuff and drinks! Sorry. Hm. Buddy! What buddy? You want to know about your father-in-law's health right? Or else we've to find out if he had taken Epass for the bus tonight. There is a way for everything right? Operation Graham bell! Dad! Nothing happened to you dad. Just a stunt is fixed to your heart as the valves of the heart are blocked. We can go home within two days. Yes dear. You can taste my dishes as usual. I've learnt new recipes also for you. I'll trial them on you. Because he's out of danger you're telling these trials and dishes, You would have to start a curry point if he's dead. Ask him to pay a policy ma'am. Moorthy! Why are you scaring me? Anything will happen to her if something happens to me right? I got a clarity by this stunt that both of our horoscopes are the same. It happened a month before in my life. It is going to happen after a month for him. I think our death is also a difference of one month. Huh? I'll die first and he'll die after a month for sure. Uncle! Do you need these negative words now? [mobile ringtone] Hello Buddy, paddu answered the call.. Hello. Dear, Is your dad there? Yeah he is. A heart surgery was done for dad. You? I’m his secret friend dear. Appadala Vijayalakshmi! I will be your aunt. How is my heart now? His heart.. He's doing well. Um…Just a stunt is fixed. Oh! It's nice dear. I think my worship doesn't go for a toss. His health is very good right? Absolutely! His beautiful words have to heard only by me when he woke up. Ok Okay. Dear! Hmm. Who's on the call? I'm asking you! Is it necessary to start your rhythms like that? He's doing well right? What next...? I plotted something for it. Let's take up the charge upon his discharge. Okay! What is this? When we entered home, he came to us with a pot! Gopalam! Why are you worrying just for this? When I entered home after the hospital work, I came across a corpse. Even so I'm good right? He's fine even after encountering these corpses, right? Anyways, if anything happens to him then we've to confirm about your ominous acts. Your heart stops working only after when his heart stops right? [Hail Lord Venkateswara] [Hail Lord Venkateswara] Lord sent me here so that your heart wouldn't stop like that uncle. Linga babu! Thanks! Accept these offerings and tie this protective thread and go inside happily. There is no fear for your life. I'll look into it from now on. By the way, who are you dear? Even if I didn't see your face, your voice seems closer. We're soulmates, father-in-law! -Hey…! -Father-in-law! In the previous birth. He told it with that feeling. Don't know the bonding in previous life. Otherwise how can a weak heart of mine take your words as oxygen, Oh, it worked!!! How I breathe the air freely like this. Dad! Feeling emotional by a stranger’s words, don’t breathe the air like this. Hello, I'm not a strange criminal, I'm your neighbourhood terrace renter uncle. Ah? Yeah. He came just now paying 6 months rent advancely. By seeing what you rented there other than the cradle prepared with used wood. Uncle! If we've the eyes to see, like the combining of the five elements while the terrace is giving us. …the high class facilities in the form of nature indirectly, Is it necessary to capture this body in a congested room? Hmm… Everything is nice dear. If you’ve to go to the restroom.. Oh! Oh my! Is the restroom needed to send the pulp out of the body? Will you do it publicly? Damn it...! Do we seem to you like that? Even if we do like that, do you've the capacity to see and bear it? Oh! When you've a spacious world, you can go and rent in a forest right? Why only beside our house!? We can. But we can't get Sri Tirumalashetty Gopalam sir there with lord balaji's blessings. He won't come to the forest for courage right? You're correct dear. I'm very scared of jungles. That's why I didn't even watch Jungle book till now. It seems like you're my luck sent by Chilukuri Balaji. Stay here! You have given a lot of courage to my heart that is filled with fear. Stay here and increase my lifespan. Thanks for your warm welcome uncle. Get lost! [Hail balaji] Move.. Brother! Will you help me in putting this inside? Hey! Allotting work as soon as your arrival! Who are you? I'm brother-in-law of Gopalam. From Nellore, Kottakaluva. Did you see how the chance from Nellore is calling us? Yeah, come on, move.. Hold this. Is this? Ok. You're like your brother-in-law man. Eat plenty of food and go to sleep. What happened to you too? Slowly.. Brother-in-law…! Ahh.. Dad! What happened dad? What is this uncle? You scared dad as soon as you came. How can I know that he's in this stage of worrying even for surprise shocks? Look at me uncle. I'm your courage. Oh! If you're courage, are we scary people? Anyways, why did you come inside? I asked him to come to lift the palms bag. Sir! A heart patient here called Ajay Ghosh, …collapsed with the fear by his brother-in-law from Nellore Do you know him? It's me, man. Man.. Hey! Listening your ambulance sound, I’m not understanding whether I’m falling with fear or getting up with fear. Ok! Don't get scared. Let's meet soon. Boy! Uncle, are you fine? My heart is getting relaxed by the touch of your hand dear. Not only your heart uncle. Every heart will be like that. The touch of my hand is vibrant. Very positive! If I heal anyone with this hand, they will get cured. Everyone will be happy if they accept this. If you tell these type of stories to patients, they will believe it. If you tell to people like us, we will hit you. Boo! Hey you fool! Just now you scared me right? I just gave a trial to see how long you will bear. I'm not a cricketer to give a trial man. I'm a heart patient. Watch a little.. Useless fellow. Uncle. To bear the fear from Nellore and to avoid the sickness, I'll train you to be fit. Uncle, come to the park tomorrow morning along with your colony friends. Park! Why? Ask to come, uncle. "Fill the aspire as breathe in you" "Even if tears surrounds your eyes" "Feel it as rainbow colours and smile" i "Even if you're entangled like crescent" "Share the moonlit like the full moon" "The good days have come.." "The good days have come.." "The good days have come.." "Everyone got good days..." "It's like a drizzle if you jump boldly" "If you've belief in the size of seed" "Don't you blossom like a tree?" "Why to step back seeing scorching sun?" "Move on like the growing shadow" "Taking birth today like the dawn" "The good days have come" "The good days have come" "The good days have come" "Everyone got good days..." Both of our horoscopes are the same. It happened a month before in my life. It is going to happen after a month for him. I think our death is also a difference of one month. I'll die first and he'll die after a month for sure. Uncle. Hey! Oh! He is back again. Brother-in-law… They are taking away the corpse. Tell me if you want to pay condolences, I'll ask them to bring the corpse to your window. Dad! Dad, open the door. Take this medicine. Dear! We're getting scared by your fear. Let's go to our village. What happened to my son? What is this? While he is getting scared, you're making him so scared by your words? ‘Gopalam come…’ When the family here is scaring him other than to give courage, won't he hide there? ‘You too will come here shortly to play’ One will say about a corpse, the other one about a medicine, …the other one tells to go away from the city. What is this? Look! How much you go away fearing of fear, it will become that much nearer to you. And he will distance himself from you If anything happens, I'm there to take you to the hospital right? Come on! -Uncle… -Dad…! What happened, brother-in-law? Let's ask the doctor to do an operation. Are you chocking? I'll help you. I'll die due to foul breath. Go away. Dear! Let’s go for an operation if needed. Don’t get scared. Give me the towel. -Take it. -Wait dear. I’ll just wipe the sweat. -Nothing will happen to you. -Wait. - Hey…! -Aunty! -Ha? Will you kill the man? I'm wiping out sweat dear. Just now I lectured you in such a way. Didn’t you remember? Will you leave it? Hey stop! What's your problem? I can't breath! Stop! Switch on the fan. Breathe in now. Breathe again. Breathe in heavily. Can you breathe now? Hospital.. Good. -You told me about the hospital! -I’ll take you. I’ll let your entire body be scanned and prove that you’ve nothing. Ok? Go and change your dress. I'll drape a nice saree and come dear. We’re going for scanning not to a function aunty. Only you come with me. -Move.. -I’ll kill you fool! This man is not needed. Move. Brother-in-law! -Dad.. -Brother-in-law! It's me, doctor! Why isn’t my heart beating? Hello! You've to put this right? Hey man…! It's a BP machine. It's the one to tie wherever you want. Hey Santu! I married without any dowry right? I'm looking after well right? You're using my car also right? Why are you so angry at me? Why did you bring this new candidate? Don't get scared buddy. It's enough if you say that he has no disease. What can I tell? Reports are there. He has to believe right? He's not the type to believe if people like us tell him. He can't understand until he loses ten lakhs believing doctor's words. That's it right? A type of revenge is not there right? It's my oath on your stethoscope. Superb sir! Absolutely perfect reports! I have never seen this type of flawless reports in my practice. You're absolutely fine. Thank God! Scannings that have to do and that can not be done to a human are also done. So you can go home happily. Just flew away. Just a cold and cough if you eat ice cream and coconut. Other than this no disease will come near you. Will I die without suffocation if that cold and cough increases? Sir! While I'm speaking about cold, you're speaking about death! If people die of cold, then what's the use of us and these hospitals? Uncle! My cousin is just giving some instances that you can't get any such small diseases also. Ah! If all are perfect then how did Koteswarrao die? We don't know about his health right? Like that your cousin doesn't know about my health, right? I too can die like that right? You can. You can go and come. Sir! We scanned your body to know about such diseases right? I have also had similar reports before. Then, why did I get the heart attack and why was the stunt fixed there? Sir! Hm.. I will lose respect for patients because of questions like this. It's the equipment bought investing in crores sir. Checking with those we the doctors scanned every body part and cleared everything there. We are doctors! Then… Why did Tamilnadu chief minister Jayalalitha who came to you die? Despite these many corporate hospitals, Why didn't you all save a life? Buddy, you both keep discussing. I'll go shopping in Dubai. Hey..sit! Then what? There won't be answers for some questions. You can’t find them in Google and you can’t understand even if we tell. Likewise, I think you didn’t understand about my health. I might also die like Koteswara Rao. Who's that Koti amidst buddy? Why would he die if that man die? Sorry. Probably that man didn’t take up these scans ...due to some budget problem. Nope...! Like I came here and took up all the scans, …he might also have taken up the scans. You're correct Gopalam. Hm. I had gone through hundreds of tests like these. Then why did I die? Don't believe these doctors. They will say that it's good before half an hour. After an hour they will confirm that the person is dead. You will also die like me. If March 1st is mine, then April 1st release is yours. What dad? What happened? No dear. Koteswara Rao is here. He is telling me that April 1st is my day and I'll die on that day. Did you see it's happening like I said before? I requested Koti to apply for insurance. What happened now? His valuable death is wasted without a rupee. You don’t make the mistake he did sir. I won’t let you do it. I brought insurance papers for you. Pay it immediately. If you don't want to pay, what if your death comes in the morning.. No..death is here for you. What will happen? Your family will also face struggles like Koti's family. Then? What will you do? What's your intention? Will I die definitely as said by Koti? Isn't your wife and daughter here? They are in the backyard. If so, you will die! Ah!!! Don't shout. When it is matched from head to heart, won't the death get matched? It will match gopalam. But don't tell me because I forced you. Ask your consciousness and tell me. Say yes! Say yes. Hmm. Suppose! If we both go for a walk in the morning and you fall down while you’re walking. Huh? Will you fall? Hmm.. Will you fall like a bird? Hmm… Not just answering. Tell me that you will fall down for my satisfaction. I'll fall down.. Hm. Tell me that you'll fall down. I'll fall down. Good. Get ready with ten lakhs tomorrow morning. Don't tell your family. This has to be amidst us. You can fall later. Santhu! Santhu! Not again! Santhu...! My dad is missing. What? Missing! Yeah. I'm not knowing where he went. He’s a man without any strength. Where will he go? You have to tell that. What? Moorthy called him at your house right? He might have gone to him. No! I couldn't see him from the time he was with him. My mother is saying that he would have scared dad in our absence. By the way, what's your guess about where he went? Doctor Babu! Doctor… Doctor Babu! Doctor. Aah.. Oh my! There he is..Move.. Move. It’s dead end. Hm..I'm caught. Doctor... What's this Doctor babu and Vantalakka? When there are so many doctors, why did you catch me? Ah…they all are fools dear. I'm a big fool of them all. I know. Santhosh spoke greatly about you. That stupid don't know when and where to elevate a person. Now. He's finished He.. Hey! I came out without informing them dear. Why? Is it to kill me without any witness? -Why did you take my phone? Give it here. -Let it be here. They are not believing that I'm about to die. That's why. You don't have any disease. The only disease you have is stupidity. Yeah..this is the disease. You told Santhosh about this one taking him aside right? Admit me. Not for a week. For a month. Until I escape from my death threat and I cure myself from this stupidity. Inject salines everyday. They are salines not the mobile chargers. Anyways, are you crazy? Is it a jipoil yoga center to come and join for fitness? This is a hospital. Hospital! I know. I know that this is a hospital. That’s why I came here. With the feeling that I’ll be safe if I’m around you all. Will you admit me or not!? Why is your voice raising? Are you threatening me? Yes, it's bullying! Otherwise I'll hand you over to our Koteswarao. Koti? Yeah. Did he come? He's with me on the stretcher. There he is. Koti! Tell him aloud. If he didn't admit you, I'll enter his body, …commit a crime and change this doctor as a criminal. Did you listen? How can I hear man? By the way, what did he say? If you didn’t admit me, he’s telling you that he will enter your body …and will not leave you. What type of blackmail is this man! A person will bring recommendation from either police or a politician. Why are you getting from devils? Leave me! I'll not leave you, doctor babu. This is the only time to prove myself as a husband to my wife. I know under what circumstances I'll die. My neighbour Moorthy also told me everything. First my daughter has to get married. My family has to be good. I've to go out healthily. I've to go inside with an illness. That's your target right? Your illness is unnecessary to me. I need my health. Doctor! Treat me immediately. Come on… Sir! This is the hospital. Patients will be here. A corona patient is also here. Rather than wandering here without a mask, if you sleep amidst the patients you will get an uncured disease and die here. Then you will understand why I'm forcing you like this. Corona! Then why aren't you speaking from before? Are you feeling now? Listen to me and go to bed peacefully. I’ll book a cab. Go home directly. Go! What if I didn't get cured even then? I too come to you sleep on your bed. Take that Koti also with you. Koti! Take leave from the doctor. Yeah, he said. Get lost! Oh! So he went to doctor Chakravarthy. Ah? Hey! I told you that he went to my cousin right? My cousin! What's up buddy!? Hey! You.. Stop. Did you send the candidate in the cab? I sent him. Very good. Keep it up, my boy. What good? What good? He baked me like a chicken. I changed myself like if the chicken is roasted for a week. I turned black. I'm almost turned into ashes. Ok, I'll come home and see you. That's it. Did you hear what my cousin said? I’m not at all understanding. How to change my father and with what he becomes normal. It’s the Moorthy who scared your father right? If we bring him and hit him badly he will never get up also. Hey! I mean he will not get up again. If we hit Moorthy now another guy will come and scare him. We will hit him too. We will keep hitting like that one by one until he get rid of fear. Bloody. He will not change if we keep on hitting like this. We shouldn’t distance the people who scare him. It’s the fear that has to be distanced. Anyone will tell all this. Tell me what to do now. This man who doesn't follow any other emotion except fear, …we've to make him to consider other important things also. It means we've to bring his likes to the upper layer and divert his mind. Er…Likes means eating, sleeping, sex..are they? They all are for you man. Tell me what suits his age. Watching where he is getting excited, we've to make him spend more time with them. Then automatically the mind gets diverted and the fear in his mind runs away. Then what likes does he have to forget even the death? Ahh.. He likes us most. He's very happy at the time of my marriage proposals. Look! They all are your family matters. They are not working here right? Tell me any other likes. Out of box! I don’t know whether to say it or not. I just have a doubt by the way. What's the doubt? Any secret life...! Does your father have any other household activities? Never mind. Tell me. Men have more enjoyment in this. Many men keep on this type of activities even at this late age you know! Will you all shut up? My father is not of that type. Which type then? But I can see an interest from her side. Oh...! Who's the girl loving your father? She is some Appadala Vijayalakshmi.. Appadala Vijayalakshmi! This name is heard somewhere. Your sister buddy...! Oh! That sister! Your sister! She's our distant relative. She's some advantageous. Did she try your father? Hey.. -Poking? -Hey… Make fun of… Shit…! Don’t know. I think so. But it is only one side love. Loving your dad and he doesn't love her! I was surprised when Corona came here crossing the countries. What's that before this one!? Hey! What happened? What deficit is there in my dad? He looks superb when he wears a white shirt. Why to speak about his beauty now? We just ate. But you gave us a good information. Let's do a trial treatment with that Appadala Vijayalakshmi …and move on to the next step based on his reaction. Okay. Ah… Santhu! -Yeah. -Come. Thanks and sorry. What for? Thanks for what you're doing right now and sorry for what I did before. "Got into the heart's intoxication" "My life came to me again" "You're my sweet darling" "You're my little angel" "You're the war of wagging" "You're the crazy girl who scolds sweetly" "I missed…" "I missed.." "I missed.." "I missed these words all these days" "I missed those days till now" "You filled my heart with oxygen again" "Very.." "I keep on staying around you" "I'll tie the knot and make you my girl.." "Got into the heart's intoxication" "My life came to me again" "On Saturdays" "In the theatres.." "You brought all the fun again" "Shall we share and eat the fast food again?" "Shall we repeat the alluring acts again?" "In the pubs" "In the parks" "In the clubs" "In the cafes" "The steps and sips missed all these days" "You have raised them in my eyes again" "Very.." "I keep on staying around you" "I'll tie the knot and make you my girl.." "Got into the heart's intoxication" "My life came to me again" Don't know when he will be normal. Brother-in-law! Hm… A call for you from some Appadam. Oh God! No. I'm not feeling well. Tell her and hang on. Hey! My cousin is not feeling well now. Call him again. How would it be if he didn't feel well dear? You've to make him feel well right? He has to get energy right? You've to make him drink red bull right? Do you want him to drink red bull? Yeah. I've shampane also with me dear. How do you relate to my cousin to make him drink all these? Ours is the telepathy bonding dear. I can hear here if he coughs there and he gets cold if I sneeze here. Sneeze once! [Sneeze] Yeah, he's getting cold. It's confirmed. -Brother-in-law.. -Hm. This is for you only. Continue. What man? What's your problem? No problem. If your heart isn't feeling well there, how can my anxiety be in my control? Ok. I'm doing well now. I'll take leave. Where? In my heart!! Ahh..what's this? You seem so different. Not different. That's what is in between us. I didn't like any man till date. Anyways, why are you liked by me? Who gave you the right to spoil my sleep by coming in my dreams? Do you know my age? I’ve a older daughter getting ready for marriage. So? Younger daughter studying schooling, a deaf mother, termadancy wife.. Never mind though. Unsupported age, my weak position. I have these many. You have a soft heart too along with all of them right? Give it to me. I’ll spend my time with that. Oh My God! Looks like you shouldn’t listen this way. Do one thing. Ask your husband to call me. If he accepts, I'm ready for what you said. Ah…hang the call. Bloody matter...! Oh my! Dear! What's that gaze? Don't talk anymore. I learnt everything. It means acting all these days that you're scary, …and proving that you’re innocent is because to bring another wife, …so that I’ll accept her right?! What do I've to do when a woman calls me? Aha…! Is she crossing her limits without your involvement? Don't tell me! Sister! Claps can be heard only if the two hands join. Fire is seen on the match box only with a stick. Remember! Oh my…! Are you my cousin or my hater? Why are you scolding my brother? I suspect you from first. When you get the call from her that day, …without eating my jaggery dosa, I prepared seeing in youtube. You went away saying papad. I request you dear. Can I be with another woman knowing about my energy and her capacity? While I'm in the fear of the arrival of my death. Yeah, these relaxation calls are to reduce that fear right? Yes bro. Stop it! Because a woman called me, …and inorder to stop her calls I asked her husband to call me right? It means, will you accept her if her husband accepts your proposal? Yeah..Shut your mouth...! You fool! [Smiles] Will any husband tells to love his wife other than a stupid like you? Look here. She is calling. Did you get the call again? - I'll answer her before you all. Listen! Hello Gopi! My love is like water. Hey you! My name is Gopalam, not Gopi. Ok naughty krishna! Gopalakrishna, go and play the flute! Bloody naughty krishna. Give the mobile to your husband! -Speak. Husband’s character! -Give me! Hello Gopi sir, are you fine? Stop respecting, man. Keep your wife in control, man. Family relations are spoiling here. Family relations! Don’t know how many there are, he may start school also. Stop it man. Because we knew the value of families, we both opened up like this. What's this opening up? It is known on our first meeting that I'm unfit for marriage. The pain of not being able to satisfy her reminds me everyday. That's why when she finds her man, inorder to join her with him.. Sister! Milk, flowers, honey..what's that Yeah Saffron crocus. Baby should be born with a glow right? Will you drink almond milk to gain strength? Are you planning copulation with him indirectly? Gopalam sir, let's plan it tonight if you accept it. Hey! What to accept man!? Damn it...! It's disgusting to hear also. [Smiles] She's jumping fastly and you're coming on to me by breaking the walls. Not like that Gopi sir.. Hey! Stop these respects. These type of matters are not possible with me. Hang the call! Why are you provoking when I'm giving respect to you? Ah? Accept my wife politely and accept to lead at least half married life. Atleast for half day otherwise.. What will you do? I'll tie you with the ropes and make her to rape you. I'll make her hit with her hair on your heart. Oh! Do you like this style? [Smiles] Herotic style! [Smiles] Sister! People like them have a good demand online. He's the follower of johnston. Why are you taking him amidst? Oh! So, you know him! He is involved only in that work day and night. Don't leave him sister. Is it ok for you Gopalam sir? Hey! Shut your mouth and hang the call man. [Smiles] -God! What are these habits dear? -Hey Lakshmi… You.. Lakshmi! Dear! You will come to know if I hide this mobile. Stop, lakshmi. Listen to me. You diverted him too much with me. He has to get that much for the fear he has. Or else when that person has to change! Santhu! Come here. You go. You go. Come fast. Do you know what happened now? Guess it! I knew everything. It's me who planned with Linga babu's sister. Is it? What's that? She's so crazy for my father! She made her husband also to speak. He said that he has no objection to their love. My dad's face is changed by that word. Without knowing how to convince mom, he ran after her saying this. Keeping the fear aside he started to appease my mom. Ok. My family came to know about this matter because of you. Thanks, Santhu! Only thanks? Anything else. When they can freely talk each other within 3 days, this foundation didn't started here Her lover, the colleague who shared her carriage in the company, …the person who shouted with Gopalam on mobile I think it is that Santhu. You go and confirm that. I'll make Gopalam to run with fear. Who's calling at this time buddy? Mosquitoes are biting if I sleep on the terrace. And here it's he. Uncle buddy. Hello uncle. Hello dear. Did you sleep? Waking up the sleeping men, why is he asking whether we slept or not buddy? Uncle. Tell me uncle. Why did you call me? Nothing dear. Due to over excitement in the heart, …I’m not able to breathe. Nothing will happen to me right? Uncle, you’re quite well. Be happy and sleep uncle. Er…What if I sleep now and don’t wake up in the morning!? Sir! We'll come and wake you up. If your soul leaves your body, I'll drag that and stitch to your body. I know that you're saying these words to give courage to me. But what can you do if my death comes? Our talent and our protection will be known only when it comes right? It means… You’re saying that nothing will happen to me and I’ve to be courageous. Is it? Thousand percent true. Go and sleep. Don’t be scared for yourself. We're with half clothes here. Directly it is getting down. Sorry for disturbing your sleep dear. Uncle, you’re not disturbing our sleep. It is your sleep, health and mind. If you couldn't fall asleep there, come here. Dear! Aah.. When he just kidded with you, will you come with your bedsheet? What are these acts like a kid uncle? How would it be if you were scared like this instead of telling us? It's also true. I'm worrying about my daughter's marriage if I suddenly die like Koteswararao. Thinking that makes my heart beat much faster dear. That too when that fear starts in my heart.. Gopalam, what's this? Will that boy reduce your suffering if you tell him? You will also die like me without getting your daughter married. You have that clarity right? Why are you still murmuring? He's scaring me like this dear? Who's that? Koteswararao! God! Is Koteswararao sir here? He is there itself. Mr.Koti! They are asking you. Talk to them once. Why those talks now? We're been shivering to sleep in the colony since Koteswararao sir died. Stop it buddy. I’ll tell you one thing uncle. Will you listen? Tell me. There is no Koteswararao or any other. I’m promising on your God Lord Balaji that there is no danger to your health, …and you will live a long life. You will happily get your daughter married to a son-in-law who gives you courage. Will get! According to my sixth sense, …your daughter’s wouldbe will send his photo through mediator tomorrow morning. Believe this. Don't know this. Listening to your words makes me more courageous. My body is bloating like an air tube. What if a person like you becomes my son-in-law? Let it happen...! Be on that word. What you thought will happen for sure. Immediately go and sleep with the person whose company gives you a peaceful sleep. Elsewhere, beside my mom. She used to make me sleep beside her and sing lullaby when I gets scared. I used to fall asleep immediately. Hm..What then? You got the solution! Go and sleep. We won't come. If so, ask Koteswararao to sing. We will come. Mom! Mom...! Why he's asking her? Mom! What dear? I'll sleep with you mom. Didn't you fall asleep? No. Come dear, come. Sleep! How did she hear so clearly? Mother doesn't need the organs to understand the suffering of the son. It's an inbuilt mechanism. The cells automatically react to our pain. See how he slept in a second. Stop it man. One minute sir. Yeah. Here a man called Tirumalasetty Gopalam who gave birth to Goddess Lakshmi is there. Where is he? Er… You.. My name is Srinivas Reddy sir. Catching the birds living alone in the dark.. -What? -I mean… I used to keep searching for good couples, …who are ready to marry and I marry them each other and fill their lives with moonlit. Ah? Are you a matrimony employee? No sir. He’s the guy who knocked Santhosh’s mind last night. He told me that you will come in the morning and you're here. By the way, you.. Didn't you understand by his excitement? He's the lotus who gave birth to Goddess Lakshmi. Wow! Is it you? -Come, let’s show you the grooms. -Come. Will the marriage get fixed if he shows? By the way, what are the matches you fixed? Nagachaitanya and Samantha. RamCharan and Upasana. Bunny and Sneha. Rana and Miheeka. It's our tollywood. - Yeah. Not only that, Varun dhawan and Natasha. Riteesh and Genelia. Kareena and Saif Alikhan. Bollywood also! Not only that. Still it's there. Suriya and Jyothika. Oh! Did you start in kollywood also? Not only that, I started in Cricket also. Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma. Ahh..this sounds too much. Thinking of a people like you, I'm here to reduce that overaction. Take a look here. Not the photo, see the hand on the shoulder. Oh! Did you think of me as you? I'm a fashioner of multiple languages. Marriages across pan India. Sir! Yeah. Being such a great personality… What’s the reason for coming to this middle class Gopalam’s house? UV started Radhe Shyam with high budget. Did they stop by that? Another.. Haa.. Oh! You're reacting like it is still working. Did they leave it? They will go wherever the concept is. Don’t get tensed. It's true. But remember my position and then.. Don't scratch there. Nothing is there. Here we've a proposal that matches your status. These are not videos, they are marriage photos. His name is Velumudra Yedukondalu. He didn't study. -But he studied humans and achieved in the society. -Is it? Yeah. He's Pasibidda Padmarao. Using wife's knowledge, …he’s a soft guy who wants to stand by his wife reducing male domination. His name is Alagey. Alagey! Hm..from Bochipurra Singlipurri. Studying a girl’s body and mind, …he will understand their sorrows and happiness. He's a male lion who moulds according to your daughter. Ok…! What? Do you like him? You shut up man! I like all the proposals. They are quite opposite to all the proposals I saw till now. Anyone is ok for me. Don't get tempted. Shall I give one option combining all their qualities? Give me. He has the culture that has to be in educated people, inferiority complex that shouldn't be in uneducated people. Not only that, if anyone misbehaves with his wife.. It's enough. Beyond everything by whom I'll die couragely.. I'll live bravely. He's of that type. Is it? He is that guy! Don't go ahead. Focus will be missed. He is Santhosh, right? Yeah. Do you know him? Why not? He lives on my neighbourhood terrace. -I told you before about a guy right? -Yeah. -He’s the guy. -He? Look there, he is coming. Santhosh! Why is he crazed? Santhosh...! Shh... Oh… -Hi. I’m Srinivas reddy. -Hello! Your father called me for a marriage proposal. -What? -Yeah. Don't know why dad does these things without telling me. I really didn't know about this. Some things happen like that. I told the lotus flower to let Goddess Lakshmi marry you. I'm here dear. Are you here? I told him and the decision is in his hands. What's there in my decision dear? All these I searched for many proposals and hospitalised with a stunt. Why would I reject a boy like him? Do you remember Santhosh? I told you last night about you as my son-in-law. God listened to my prayer. That's why the god sent this Srinivas. [Hail Govinda] Shall we start now. [Hail Govinda] Uncle...! It's fine you're getting excited. But it's a marriage. It's not enough if you like, your daughter also has to like right? What dear? Did I tell you that I didn't like it? Not that side dear. Run this side. Why are you here dear? You go to that side. Go that side, meet there and confirm it. Why delay? Run! Are you sure? Oh! I'm double sure.. [Smiles] Why did you send? Nothing. He has a meeting in the backyard. Both are becoming one. What is this twist? Suddenly you brought someone. He's my cousin, Srinu bro. Oh! Why did you dare so much? If my dad suspects.. If we sit thinking that he will suspect, …he’s waking up a new disease thinking about your marriage. No matter how much we convince, he's going to peaks at night time. That's why I planned like this without any delay. That's ok. What if he knows that the man who scared him and the colleague is you? In this meantime, we will give him a grandson. No way dear. Kids so early! No way! Why? Why...? My wish…My wish.. Sir. Taste this Chicken kheema sweet. Chicken kheema sweet! It means, is the hen suffering from sugar? My wife is a specialist in cooking. This is today’s special. Take it. Oh! I’ve to go a long distance. I'll go and bring happiness to your home talking to Maruti sir. -My heart becomes happy listening to these words. -Yes! I'm not understanding where the fear has gone I'm having all these days. That's why elders used to say, …if we are with the people we love, our life span will be increased. Do you know what I'm thinking now? I'm thinking that I'll have no death till 90. Just 90! You will live for 100 years if you stop eating the sweets she cooks. When will you bring the information man? All the functions are happening here. What happened? Huh? What man? Then what about my matter? What do we've to do now? A big thing happened sir. What happened? - Abbul is affected by corona. He met me in the morning. He sneezed in front of me. He might have passed it to me. I would have been affected by it. I think I passed it to you. Maybe the death you wished for may come in the form of corona. Oh God! You've to save Gopalam's family. Yes Prathyusha! The situations aren't good. We thought it wouldn't come so far. But it is here. Corona engulfed the whole country. Situations become scary. Some of the corpses on the stretches, in the bags are seen here. Corona deaths are increasing day by day. Those who have mild symptoms are dying with heart stroke. Look, how I'll shock Gopalam. I'll send him the videos of orphan kids, corpses of people who died with corona. In Amalapuram an old woman, her son, two kids, and his wife. It's like Gopalam's family. Everyone died with corona. I'll send him the video also. He will die of a heart stroke. If you didn't bring him out, I'll strike your head like a coconut. In order to not to change healthy people as patients with the words like yours, …who kills their courage and change people as patients, …and to get the people like you understand. I'll turn your head into pieces.. Yes! Then let's shoot that video and turn it viral. Reach is also superb. Sorry. Hey! Why do I need your sorry? Bloody sorry! Go and bring him out convincing that he has nothing. -What are you seeing? -Go. Go! -What are you seeing? - Go, man! Gopalam sir! Sir! I'm policy moorthy. I don't have any corona. I learnt that Abbul sir is also safe. It is the name invented by Chinese people for cold. Oh! The fever tablet Paracetamol, …and the bleaching powder sprinkled beside the roads when VIP’s comes right? Yeah.. By sprinkling it and by washing with triplex soap, it will be driven away. Anyways, you don't have any corona. You don’t get it sir. Be free and come out. Is it? Yes. It will stay only at the place where the lock down is going on. It is said that it will not be in the places where people are crowded and at wine shops. Anyways, corona is afraid of us sir. Ah…If so, you go and scare that. I'll be here. Looks like he will not come. Couldn't I understand that Santhosh is making you say all these for me? Go! Until the news channels gaggles that corona is completely gone, …and shows only good news except death news. -and when the cameras didn’t record the cries of dead one families… -and when only the healthy news is heard, then I’ll come out. I will not come until then and I'll be here. It means he will come when we're married and our kids are getting ready to marry. Get lost man! I know everything. [TV news ] Oh my! Did you understand now? The easier it is to intimidate a person, ..the harder it is to dare to say it and bring him out. Never mind. Struggle a bit hard and convince him and bring him out. If not.. Let's go! Hm… Good evening bro. I need a corona patient immediately. I want the tea cup he drank. I want the virus in him. It's too hot, can the virus sustain? Bro! I dipped from the saliva of an advanced corona patient and took it out. If you just smell that, it will effect the lungs directly. -Try it once and see. -What should I try? -Never mind. Try it. -What is he saying? That is.. Ah…Did he bring tea for Gopalam? Yes ma'am. Give it here. I'll give. Give it. What are you thinking? Mother is saying that she will give the virus. You go. Ok, bro! Be careful mother. What's that to your mouth like a monkey? I wore a mask to escape from the corona. Oh... Gopalam! Gopalam! Open the door dear. Why did she come here now? Mom! Why did you come here? Go back. Why have you not seen since yesterday? Come and have some tea. Open the door. Alas! How can I drink tea? I'm suffering from a disease. It will be passed to you too. Will you come and sleep in my lap? Come dear. Oh God! Your deaf is killing me. I don't want that tea. You drink! Can't understand his behaviour. Hm. Hmm… Ramachandra! Brother. You told me 24 hours. It is 36 hours now. Why the screams and shouts aren't heard from the home? Oh my! I'm feeling tired. Ah? Eat there and jump on the walls. It will be cured. You said correctly. Both of them are torturing us. He's from inside and she's from here. They are torturing us without being attacked by a disease. Paddu! Hm.. I think something is wrong. Hey Shiva! Save me my lord. [ambulance siren] Buddy, grandma tested positive. What are you talking about, doctor? No one in our house has corona and she didn't go anywhere. There is no possibility of coming out of the house. Did you check the reports correctly. Are they her reports? What are you speaking? Her lungs are completely infected and the pulse rate has dropped. It will decrease drastically for every hour. If she is kept in the ventilator now. I can't do anything. By the way, because she tested positive, it's better for you all to be tested. It's fine with all of them. What can we say to her father? He locked himself in home even though he got the negative report. If he knows about a positive case in his home and it is his mother.. I've forgotten. He will show you the hell. He… He is torturing us although he has no disease. I'll wear a PPT kit and go for a walk. -Doctor! -Doctor! What shall we do now Santhu? It will be a problem only if he knows. Let's manage it without knowing to him. Move. How to bear your dad now? Hello! Gopalam sir! Corona tested positive in your family. It is going to effect your family sir. What are you saying sir? I mean to say… It targeted the elder one in your family. It shifted your mother to the ICU. Her position is very critical sir. No one is there in the house sir. Everyone went to the hospital for tests. Maybe they will also test positive. Not that they are tested positive sir. When the person's position in the hospital is so worse, …then what’s your position sitting alone in the dark room? Oh God! Don't know what sin you've committed in your births, …the entire family is effected by the same disease. Ah!? Telling this bad news by myself is my fate sir...! Mom! Lakshmi! Paddu! Ah? Where are they? Mom! Mom! Mom! Where are you all? Lakshmi! Mom! Where are you? Paddu! Mom! Where are you? Lakshmi! Where are you all? Mother! Mother! Mother...! Mother! Mother! Lakshmi! Where are you all? Where is my mother? Nothing dear. She’s suffering from a toothache. Why are you telling lies? Huh? Do you think that I don't know when mother is going away leaving me here? Do you think that I can't imagine that my family is burning like an orphan corpse? Dear! You're thinking more. Doctor is telling that nothing will happen even we're effected with corona. Many people got cured and are going home in front of us. No. Their valuation and my valuation is different. Koteswarao told me. Everything he said is happening but what you said is not happening. What he said is not true dear. I can not live anymore bearing this fear. Before my death comes and kills me, I will die.. Alas! Dear! -What are you talking about? -I’ll die! I will die.. Listen to me. I'll become the soul and meet you all. I'll look after you all well being by your aside like Koteswarao. I'll go to Koteswarrao. I'll die. Nothing will happen to you dear. Don't hang the call. Dear! I'm calling you.. I will die. I'll die I'll die. I'll die. You made the right decision now. Go ahead. I'll hang with my mother's saree and die. Uncle...! Uncle, do you know what you're doing? Are you about to die now thinking about the death's arrival? You who have to say to be brave if a difficult situation arises, ...are you thinking to die like a coward? Uncle, if you panics like this as an elder to the home then what about kids? Did you ever think? Uncle, if death is the only solution to every problem in our life, ...no one in this world will be alive. Uncle! Love, sorrow, sympathy, courage, fear are just emotions in our life uncle. Giving equal importance to all these and when we learn how, when to feel then only …we can sustain as a human. If we give importance to only and if we inflate it, it's not only you who lose in life. Your family who believed you also. How easily we accepted our birth and our life …and if we can able to accept that death will come one day, …we can live everyday happily. Every single day! If not! If we keep on waiting for it's arrival when and how it will come, What’s the meaning to to that life uncle? I'm feeling good when you're saying dear. But when I remember corona… That’s what I’m saying. It is corona today and some other disease will effect another day, Shall we live a scary life thinking about that? Shall we die before it comes? It's not corona or some other disease you've to distance uncle. You've to get rid of the fear in you. Then watch yourself, …no virus will hurt you. Ok! Let's think that you're not so brave. God is there right? You believe in him strongly. Huh? Leave it to him. You who doesn't harm anyone, pray to God to look after you too.. Give your life and fear to him. He will take care of it. Your mother is asking about you there uncle. When you can't sleep, -by putting her hand on your heart and assuring that she's there for you, ...is waiting for you uncle. If you didn't go there now, and if you're not able to save your mom, …you've to face the sorrow for the lifetime. By which mother you stepped on the earth, …in her last moments you’re distancing her with your fear. You will keep on cry remembering her love. Your mom is waiting, uncle. It's your wish now. Mother.. Oh God! What is this mom? Why are you pressing my legs? Am I a kid? You're a kid to me. I don't know about others. "Seeing the unseen God in you" "I'll stay in your memories" "You're my hope and you're my breath" "I keep on loving you" "Love is the moment that is seen in the eyes" “I’ll be with you no matter how many ages! i What is this buddy? Excellent! Her pulse rate became normal seeing him. Because the oxygen she need is there right? What a medical miracle is this, my cousin!? It's an inbuilt love vaccine buddy. There will be no fear in front of the courage it gives. Superb buddy. From today, the treatment in this hospital will be changed completely. It's a waste of spending lakhs of money. It's enough if they be by their side and assure them that they are there for them. No need for any treatment. Take care of the patients with patience even from now on. Don't get frustrated. Yeah. No frustrations from now on. They are my family. First put on the mask or else you will die. [Sneeze] -What kind of doctor are you? -Sorry. Buddy! Buddy! Dad...! We all tested negative. You too go and check. Yes dear. Why? I'll also test negative. I've no disease and it will not come. Uncle! You're too confident. Don't be like that. If your Koteswarao comes and says anything to you! Not only the dead Koteswarao, I'll not listen to anything even Moorthy comes and tells me anything. Anyways, koteswarao is not a soul. It’s the fear in me. When I've that fear, Koteswarao comes and scares me. He will not come now. See if you want. Can I scare you by telling you a scary matter? I’m the person who went to the brink of death. What can the fear you tell me will do to me? I'm telling you. Your Strength! Get ready… Hi uncle. My name is Santhosh. I and Paddu are colleagues. We've been in a relationship for the last three years. We will marry if you like and accept us. Giving strength to you throughout the lifetime we will also be happy. With the reason of being a colleague, will you change my truck? You..Appadala Vijayalakshmi! Oh! Listening to that voice sounds strange to me. Did you see? He's your step-wife. What do you say now? Will you marry my daughter? Ok, go on. Let's see whether you scare me as a son-in-law or… I'll give you courage as a father-in-law. Hm! You will say here like this. What if Moorthy enters there? Hello! I'm living as a corona patient losing the pulse rate completely. Anyways, everyone has to face their destiny. How did you get corona sir? Why wouldn't it come when I come to destroy one's life? Be careful ma'am. It's a cup worth of one lakh. Ok! Hey, I'm back! Hey! Huh? Hey, dude! A person called Asuya Anandrao who can't be happy if anyone is happy. Who's he? It's me dear. It's time for your journey. Union in Shiva. Come out. -Come on, guy. -Move! Come on! Policy Moorthy sir! It’s over, pack your bags. 'Don't spoil, you will be spoiled' Did you write now? If you would have written it before itself, I would have escaped from this fate. People like policy Moorthy and Koteswarao are there in everyone's life. These people acts smart as if they are telling, -precautions to us, by killing our courage, -confidence and increasing the fear in us they are getting psychotic happiness. If we are able to save our lives without getting influenced by these people, …we all get good days. "The good days have come" "The good days have come" "The good days have come" "Everyone got good days..." [SUBTITLES BY TITLES MEDIA]
