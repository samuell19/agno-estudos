Tell her I'm not feeling well. l want to see a doctor. And l want to see her. Your name, sir? I'm Kit! But she said she won't take your messages. Thanks! It's really you! You're late. Why are you dressed like this? She's going for broke tonight. Where's Johnny? He's busy at the studio. Okay! Busy? On Christmas Day? Why are you dressed like this? I'm dressed for sex. Problem? Another new one?...Look! Your hands are cold. Will the color fade? You just rubbed it off. Did Johnny drop you off? Of course not. l took a taxi. Will he come when he's done? Or will he come before he comes? He'll call me when he's done. Lucky you, born on Christmas Day. Thanks! She didn't contribute. l didn't think so. Please find a real job. Can you make a living on this? At least find a boy friend. You're so lonely. And you're a nag. I'm going to pee. Here's a bottle. You know what she told me? What? I'll be celibate, and work like a mule all my life. What a blow. l know! Which is worse? What's up? You're mean, saying I'll be celibate. That's bad? Of course! Curse your mouth! My birthday gift to you is, I'll tell your fortune. No! - Don't! - Mind your own business. You're not good together. This card means ''Lies''. One of you lies to the other. The last card is the best. But it's upside-down. Which canceIs it. You guys are doomed. That's it? Can you check to see... Who lies to whom? Hi! Happy Birthday! Thank you! You've met? Alan, meet Jeannie. We've met once. Where's Johnny? What's up? What is it? Sanni predicted their relationship. And said they'll lie to each other. Did you order the birthday cake? How can you announce it like that? Sorry! You ruined the surprise. What? Don't believe everything she says. Maybe she's a charlatan. Especially since it was free. So violent. l saw Johnny with a Caucasian Woman. Really? When? l drove by the cinema last week. Before the midnight show. Were they holding hands? l think so! Do you know her? Why didn't you tell us? How would l know? You're good! l saw her at the studio. She was the model for his last job. Is she pretty? Call him at the studio. l did. No answer. He may be out with her. Idiots! They cut up our cake. And served it to other customers. They're offering to pay for the cake. But it won't help. What? Take Jeannie home. No need, I'll do it. No, you live far away. Too bad Sue is gone, she's got a car. And you? I'm going somewhere else. Trying to get rid of your boyfriend? Let's get going. Clara wants me to take you home. What? What? Nothing! You never met Johnny? Why are you so late? Overtime. Did you eat? Not yet! You didn't answer your phone. It broke. It did? When? Just now! How was drinks? Okay! What? Okay! Okay... This tastes better. Really? Where should we go? Home? What? You didn't see the guy outside? Who is he? Who do you think? I'm with him tonight. Don't you understand? I'm with him now. What do you mean? He's my boyfriend. You're... Say it again. I'm breaking up with you! Come here! - What? - Come here! Really? Don't l look serious? Not so loud! What's with you? You okay? How long ago? Long time! You're something! Changing like that. What do you mean? You were so unhappy! And now you look fine. Was he pretending to be sad? How could you pretend? Was that good? Lucky l was the one who changed. Not he! You're the one who changed? Whoever says so first. If he said it first, I'll be the sad one. Now l should celebrate. So you're not unhappy? No! l don't know why. But I'm not. Can you say that again? l don't understand. l just told you. Tell me again. You owe me that! What did l do? What do you think? Did you sleep with her? What are you saying? You did?! Clara! l didn't know you're that close. You met her only once before her birthday. It's only 2 weeks, and you... It's not as simple as that. How complex can it get in 2 weeks? You're the one who wanted to break-up. l didn't mean it literally! We'll break up after this party. What do you mean? Go to the party, then break up. Party first, then break up! Okay? Which one are we doing now? Both! You want to break-up, l didn't want to go to the party? Right! So why should l go since we're breaking up anyway. Why not? l told my friends you'd go, so go. It's just like you. Running away like that. What a bore! How old are you? Will you care about other people's feeling? Always having your way. In fact, l care too much about the others! Merry Christmas! Where's Jeannie? Washroom! So you did come. Up to your tricks again? I'll tell your fortune. At no charge. No, no need, it wouldn't help. - Happy Birthday! - Hello! Thank you! You've met? l introduced you two. How can you be together? You'll be cursed! l told you to take her home. Where did you take her? l cried my contact lenses out. You're something of a classic. l eat ice cream when I'm sad. You're not as sad, so eat the small pack. l told him you're my boyfriend. Because in the mirror in the taxi. We look good as a couple. That's why. Not everything is so clear-cut. Like this. You look blurred, now you're clear. Clear, blurred. You can wear glasses. l look terrible in glasses. Whoever sees me in them must marry me. I'll show you how terrible l look. But I'm not planning to get married. Well? And you are? Shut up! Can't you see we're breaking up? You'll regret this. She's only a child. Maybe l like that. I'm not a bore to her. What do we do? This is it! What are you thinking? What are you thinking? What are the chances we'd be together? Can you tell? Listen! If Clara didn't tell you to take me home. Clara wants me to take you home. And we don't look good as a couple. This wouldn't have happened. Ironic. If Clara hadn't exposed Johnny. l saw Johnny with a Caucasian woman. And if you hadn't just broken up. Party first, then break up! Then she wouldn't have told you to take me home. Take Jeannie home. If you didn't take me home. And l didn't see us in the mirror. l wouldn't have brought you to Johnny. And l wouldn't have cried. And all these would not have happened. So, it's all fate! The supplier won't give us a break. We can only gain 3% revenue. That's not worth it. l wonder if New York will allow this. Let's talk to the supplier again. Do we have another supplier? If we did we'd be with them. Alan, what do you think? Me? l feel, no matter what. We should order supper. What's with Alan lately? Dating! We can't meet tonight? You have a meeting in the morning. I'm just worried about you. You'll be wasted. I'm fine. l know, let's just talk. We really can't meet? It's 3 a.m. That early? It'll be dawn when we meet. Big deal. You're still sick and won't take medicine. You never listen to me. Guess what I'm doing now? What? It's a secret. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? You've lost your mind! Can you hear me? Crazy! Buddy, turn on your headlights. We're really not meeting? Don't be silly! Just don't regret this. What an exciting night! Yes... Across from the Western Tunnel. What's up for tomorrow? Standing by for a call, Flying again. Where to? Frankfurt! Germany! Another long haul? You don't have time tomorrow anyway. But l do tonight. It's past 4. It's almost dawn. And your car. So what. You won't be able to sleep here. So what! Breakfast delivery. You're nuts! Your nose is so big. It's out of proportion. Your standard is so strange! With your square face. Why is a square face out of proportion? Why did l think you're handsome? Your eyebrows are so thick. Cheeks big like blowfish. Mouth beyond description. And my ears? They're average. l regret this. Can you see my face with your eyes closed? l can! l close my eyes and see you. Do we know each other well? What don't l know about you? Am l so shallow? Can you still love someone, if you know him inside out? Test me! On what? What will make me dislike you. That's a strange game. Hurry! Ask! Why am l doing this? Hurry! l have a bad tooth. l knew that already. Your breath stinks. l have hepatitis. Really? Look at you. Did it become chronic? I'm not playing. Never mind. But you need liver shots. Should l get tested, too? You look silly with that bag. Why did you give it to me? No. yours is heavy. No, it suits you better. All right, we'll swap. Guess what l put into your bag. (Condom) Strawberry flavor. What time is our flight? l keep telling you, 11 :10! Why can't we wait and go tomorrow? A night flight saves a day on our vacation. Why must we travel on vacations? Why can't we sleep at home? Why must we sleep at home, and not travel? You're boring! But you didn't say that when we first met. You're like a statue of Buddha. Bear hug! What are you doing here? Just came out of the lift. - Where are you going? - Shanghai! What are you up to? Same old things. Did you move? No, I'm still there. Did you change jobs? Same job! Your friend? Yes! l thought l saw you last month. Really? Where? - Where? - Let me take your bag. In the park near my home. The girl looked just like you. Really? Yes! So l sat there. All day, waiting for her to turn her head. Thinking, ''turn around''. And then? It wasn't you. Well? Isn't that something? That's really something. Your friend is interesting. He's really something. He drove a garbage truck in England. That suits him. Do you have to be so mean? That depends. He's my friend. He was looking at your breasts. l just wanted you to know. He is a very good friend. He helped me when l was down. l believe that. So, did he court you? Yes! And we went to bed once. You told me that to upset me? l had just ended a relationship then. That's not a reason. l was feeling very down. That's not a reason either. It was an accident. GirIs should not have accidents. And you? You've never done it? l was younger, then it didn't count. And that's a reason? I'm a man, you're a woman. That's a lousy reason. If you were fair you wouldn't think so. That's fair? Men and women are not always equal. You're the one who said ''fair''. It's hard to reason with you. You never follow other's arguments. Men and women will never be equal when it comes to sex. Try to be objective, and you'll agree with me. l don't know what you mean. Of course not. If a guy like that could get you in bed. Should we make peace? Let's not waste the air ticket. It's the garbage driver's fault. You never mentioned him. That means he's not important. No, but you slept with him. No man can accept, his girlfriend having slept with a guy like that. Then what kind of guy is okay? This? You wish! That? You want that? That? You're kidding! Why not? Look at his jacket. That? Looks like a rapist. How's this one? You'll have a hard time. You're bad! You men are trouble. That's why l like women. Well? You shouldn't have done that. Sorry! Even though you're a woman. You shouldn't do this in public. When I'm with you, there are a lot of firsts. Such as? Travelling on vacation. And... And what? And being hit like that. l said sorry. l know. Come here. That's more like it. Finally made it. What's wrong? Nothing! Let's go! When does the ball start. At 8! Who will be there? Everyone. Bosses, overseas partner, clients. Do you like my dress? Not okay? Do you have another? l feel like I'm at a circus. How's this? This? Better? l fell like I'm at a night club. How's this? Say no more. Can you remove that thing in the middle? This is good. Not to plain? Plain is good. Let's go! Wait! What? You're kidding. Go without me. How's this? Looks okay if l put my hair up. Don't, you jaws are too big. How's this? You don't look good in short skirts. Your legs are too fat. Does your roommate have anything? You're picking on me! You always find fauIt with me. My face is like an olive, l shouldn't change. You can just change a girlfriend. l was perfect, now my legs are too fat. Too fat?! How's this? Good! It's not my dress. It doesn't matter. It does. What do you like about me? If l didn't look like this. Would you have gone out with me? But then you'd be someone else, right? Yes, it's all me. If you didn't look like this, I'd still love you. That's not hard. Even if you had nothing, I'd love you. Don't treat me like this again. You guys have broken up long ago. l didn't say l wanted to be with him. Can't we see each other? Every time you see him you bring bad luck. Even l wouldn't want to see you. Yes... - Come, don't be so sad. - You making fun of me? Don't eat it if it makes you sad. What are you trying to do? The closer you get the more he hates you. Are you busy? Yes! How much longer? A while! Say something. It's nothing. He ignores me. l pretended l didn't care. But he's just as mean. How did you pretend? For a week l talk to him without looking at him. That's very difficult. Yes, very. l want to see you. No, I'm still busy. Why don't l come to your office? And do what? Watch you work. Come here to watch me work? Where are you now? I'll take the other train. That train just took off. I'm not coming. So l won't be in your way. Do you love me? I'm working. Then I'll go home. Let's get married. Sure, when? Tomorrow. Make an appointment with my secretary. Let's really get married. Do you miss me? Yes! How much? Are you tired of me? No! l know you are. We use to do it 3 times a night. Now we'll die before that happens. You said you could. Not any more. l want to see you. Want to see me? Yes! Really? I'm coming over. I'm going home. How much longer will you be? A while! Don't work too late. Goodbye! Breakfast delivery. You're not done yet? Not yet? Call me tomorrow. I'm going to bed, bye. Aren't you open till 9? We close early tonight. l have a notebook l have to pick up. Can you open up to let me get it. l don't know which one is yours. One of your guys is fixing it for me. He left early. Let me get it myself. He called to tell me it's done. l don't know which one it is. l do. Here's my receipt. Please. l don't have the key. That guy is gone. Come back tomorrow. Let's go. Can you get him back? l don't have his number. We open at 11. Come back then. My boyfriend's flying tonight. All his files are inside. It's important. Not the black one, Grandma. The little red one. Isn't this red? It's the red one. Your handwriting is too small. Listen to me! On the first page. Open it to the first page. The small numbers on the side. Read them to me. 964. Wait a moment. 9 what? 964...964... Was that one or two 964's? 964...964...0777 Listen, Grandma. Was that one or two 964's? 0777...964...0777 Grandma, one or two 964's? Brat! I'm telling you now. All you young people are the same. Never at home. No one to turn on the water heater for me. l can't even take a bath. Or cook, it's worse than a nursing home. You brat! Yes, come back and open up. She says her boyfriend is leaving tonight. Yes! What a drag! Yes, come back. Thank you! He's coming! Alan! Aren't you leaving tonight? It's been changed. It's fixed? l thought you needed it soon. I've been in a meeting. Forgot to tell you. Are you going out? It was a long meeting. We're gonna go grab a bite. And you? Where are you going? Then go home! Fine! What is it? Nothing! This is nothing? Yes, I'm going nuts, okay? Wait for me! We'll go eat! No! l don't need you your pity! Go home then. Alan Hing, don't ever call me again. I'm busy. This is difficult. Can you stoop these daily tantrums? Let's break up! Go ahead! Alan Hing! Alan Hing! l work, too! You're not the only one with meetings. That's great. Why don't you appreciate what l do? l didn't tell you to do all this. Why must you do everything? l can buy these myself. l can ask my secretary to pick this up. Or get a messenger. Why are you doing all this for me? Because l care about you. That's not caring. l don't understand. Neither do l! This is hard for me. And also for me. Let's break up, okay? Where did l do wrong? It's my fault! The better l treat you, the worse you become. You were different. So were you. Because l treated you better. In a fight it's always the guy's fault. Why are we so unhappy? We don't understand each other. l don't know you well. But l know you well. Lucky you. l thought you were... Something. Had personality. So now l have no personality. You only care about me now. What's wrong with that? You take me for granted. I'd be happy if someone cared. You'd be happy if l stopped caring? It's not only that. But forget it. Let's just break up. l don't know what l want. l know! You want to break up. Actually I've thought of it a while now...but... Enough said. It's getting ugly. l don't want you to be sad. Are you okay? Don't worry, l won't bother you again. Is Edmond there? Wrong number! That's impossible. Is this 9097-8820? Yes, but there's nobody here by that name. Nobody? That's impossible. It's this number. Did you remember the wrong number? Or are you using your friend's old phone? You're mistaken. Again? Impossible. It's this number. You remembered right? You're not using your friend's phone? No! Well, sorry to trouble you. Well, goodbye. Goodbye! Well? Heard enough? Let's catch a movie. These two, please. Never mind. Get you a drink? Two carrot and pear juices. We're out of pears. You are, then... Two glasses of orange and what else? Shopping? Do you think l should look for him? Last night the phone rang. l think he was calling. l told him never to bother me, but maybe... Call him and ask if it was him. You think l should call him. He wasn't sure he made the right decision. It's been a month. He's had plenty of time to show remorse. What will he do if l look for him? Make you feel worse. You okay? Why will he make me feel worse? Because he doesn't love you anymore. Don't cry! Why not? What do you like about him? Was he really that good? Find someone else. It was the same with Johnny. You feel worthless, if they stop loving you. Many people love you. Don't, you're making yourself... So ugly! Stay with me! Want me to stay longer? Come to my office. I'm not busy. I'll keep you company. Take care! Bye! What can l get you, sir? Coffee! You've lost weight. You have to go back? l come to... Your coffee, sir! l asked you here to tell you. We can be friends again. l called. They said you were in London. You called me? l went for a month of training. Came back last week. A promotion? You can say that. But it depends on the interview. There are 5 other candidates. For what post? Purser. A good chance? It's okay. They want 2 out of 6. But another person and l are more senior. Good! You should work on your career. A lot has happened in these 2 months. Not only you, but many things. l feel I've been hypnotized. Then ''bang'', awakened. I'm really immature. Every time l see an ex-boyfriend. l feel strange. l feel l couldn't have loved them. l didn't know what l was doing. l say he's not good, he's not nice. But the problem is myself. After we broke up, l hated you for a while. Very much so. l felt, l was so good to you. You have no reason to dislike me. l loved you, and you mistreated me. So l said things l shouldn't have said. Because l wanted to hurt you. Because you hurt me. But it's really not one else's business. It's all because I'm not mature enough. When l went to England. l wanted to cry as soon as l landed. Because you told me. When you have a girlfriend. You'd take her to see your old professor. Then you asked when we can go. Now I'm there. But I'm alone. l got off the train. When l passed by your university. l feIt you were so far away and I'm scared. Why have you become a stranger? If l didn't have this feeling. Then I'd have nothing left. On the third day l went to your school. Sat in your dining hall. And thought, you were here. And l cried. Was l not good enough? On the train to London. l met a boy from Hong Kong. He asked if l was a tourist. l said yes. He asked where my camera was. And took a picture of me. He told me he'll send it back. And l got it yesterday. He wrote ''To my sad friend'' on it. Then the phone rang. l had a hunch it must be you. So l picked up. But there was no sound. l feel everything must come to an end. Suddenly, all my feelings returned. Like 4 years ago. When l graduated and moved out. Everything was new. My heart stopped hurting. l was no longer sad. As thought my heart has returned. l can start over. l thought of looking for you. Wrote letters to you. Didn't mail any. l told myself, if l look for you. And hope that you still want me. l wouldn't do it. l won't let anyone treat me like that again. l told Heman l wanted to find and tell you. l no longer care for you. He said if that is so l wouldn't need to find you. l said l didn't want you to think l need you. Heman said, forget it, Jeannie... You can't win. So l give up. l can only say. l really loved you. Then l was hurt. Then... l hoped one day the hurt would stop. And l can start over. I've been waiting. For that day. And it's finally here. Is that you? I've moved these. And packed up your things. You had another car accident? l fell down at work. Make sure your things are all there. You left everything here for a year. And now you're taking it all at once. l wanted to bring some to you. Is this book mine? Yes! When did l get such a boring book? l wanted you to read it so you did. It's your birthday today. Yes! l don't have a gift. Didn't think l would see you today. I've been transferred to another base. Really? Where to? Hawaii! Alan, you really are not going? No, you guys have fun. Bye! Are you serious? You really want to apply 1 year's leave? Are you looking for a new job? Tell me when you look for a new job. If l can't swim. Can l start with snorkeling? l guess so. What about your boyfriend. He going with me. How's your girlfriend? What girlfriend? You broke up? Broke up with who? Weren't you with a Caucasian woman? What Caucasian woman? Clara said she saw you at midnight show. It must have been someone else. Maybe a Caucasian woman happened to be next to me. Why would l lie to you? Why are you so upset? You waited a year to ask me? But could it have been someone else? It's doesn't matter. As long as you're happy with Alan now. Hold the line, Clara. Where are you? I'm on my way. Haven't feIt this good in a long time. l never knew how to appreciate this. l must tell you something. Me too. You, too? Love you! We'll talk later. Well? l must have made a mistake. About what? He's gone. l stalked my girlfriend like that. I'm not stalking him. What are you doing then? l don't know. You used to stalk your girlfriend? Yes! How? From the moment she leaves her home. All the way until she returns home. And then? Then l got sick. l thought I'd continue after l got better. But when l recover, l felt. She's not that great. Stupid, huh? That's life. But there won't be a next time for me. Me neither!
