Rrow. Uh... honey? I don't think that’s gonna fit. Just a little more dear. Got it! See hon, I told you I could do it. ♥ Dee Dee. ♥ Yes. Yes. With this all powering Neurotomic Protocore in my possession, I will make the world mine! Haa haa haa! Haa haa haa haa haa! Haa haa haa haa! Haa haa! Unhand that Neurotomic Protocore Mandark! Who said that? I did! Dexter! Blast you Dexter! Hay, now’s there's an idea. Blast Dexter. Yes. Blast Dexter! Ooooh. Know this Mandark, that as long as I live you will never possess the Neurotomic Protocore. I swear it. And I swear Dexter for as long as I shall live, I will one day possess the Neurotomic Protocore and rule the world. I swear it. Whew! Now that that is taken care of I can get back to work. Have your gibberish woman. I have no time for you today. Much too much has happened. So I bid you adieu. Goodbye sister. You know the exit is this way, goodbye. Dee Dee, how many times do I have to tell you to stay out of my laborrr... You're not Dee Dee. W-w-w-who are you? We are here to destroy the one who saved the future. Ahhhhhoo ahh ahh ahh ooh aah.... ...! Enough! No robots are going to threaten me in my lab. Even if they are from the future. Futuristic robots prepared to meet your maker! Ahhhh! Well, that was easy. No dumb robots from the future can destroy this little genius. But boy oh boy. I must be something else for somebody to go through all this trouble. Boy oh boy. Dexter, the boy who saved the future. Woo! I can't wait for the future. Pft. The future is taking too long. Wait a second, I don't have to wait for the future. I'll just get into my old trusty time machine. And zap, boom, pop! I'll get to see how cool I am. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. Oh boy! Future, here I come. This is very peculiar. The lab seems untouched. But I have traveled the years into the future. Is nothing different? This is different. Aliens! Hey! What are you non-aliens doing in my laboratory? Your laboratory? This is our rec room. Who are you? What are you doing here? What's your number? I do not have a number. I am Dexter the one who saved the future. And I live here. - Yow! - No number, huh? Come with me. It is a sad sad world when the no numbers can just waltz on in onto private property with no trouble at all. I hope you like jail Mr. No Number. Officer 9-4-1-2 here. How can I be of assistance? I have here, a no number! Were on our way. Let's get him boys. Aye! Pffffffft. Dexter boy, sometimes this is just too easy. Closet!?! This is supposed to be the front door. Stop where you are and put your hands in the air! Where is the front door?!? Where is the front door? Wait, I wonder if my old emergency exit route is still here. Where'd he go? He's nowhere to be found. I guess I don't live here in the future. My folks must have moved out when the neighborhood started growing. Boy, what cool cars. Wow. Would ya' look at that. The future. Clearly these achievements must be my own. Unauthorized walking. Identify yourself. Dexter, boy genius. State your number. I have been told I have no number. Retinal scan. Number 12. Why are you not at your workstation? Workstation! I don't work, I'm a boy. Must return to work station. How can I return to a workstation I have never even been too? That is right. My future self. Well Mr. Robot, it looks like 'duh' you are taking me exactly where I want to go. To the heart of the city robot. Where my laboratory in the sky awaits. I love the future! Mmm, breakfast.. 8:52, Holy cow, I'm almost late. I better log on. Good morning number 12, welcome to work. Aw, just made it. Wow, I could have been in big big trouble. Number 12? Y-y-yes sir? You are almost late this morning. But but but but but but. Report to my office immediately. You're expected. You! Almost late for work again. Tisk tisk tisk. Such a pity. There are two types of people in this world number 12, there are those who struggle to support their families. Scratching and scraping. For any little morsel of food… oh! They can find. And there's the strong and powerful the elite. With luxuries that others can't possibly dream of. Would you number 12… are neither. Ha haha ha hahahaha hahahaha ha haha hahahaha haha ha! Hey, hey, hey. What you think you're are doing? This is not my laboratory in the sky! Mandark! Ladies and gentlemen please excuse the interruption. I invite you to join me in the public floggings of a number 12, for once again he was almost late for work. And so number 12 before we get started, do you have anything to say for yourself? Could I have some padding? No. Now make a wish. Ahhh! Number 12? Again! Ohhh! Number 12? Again! Ahhh! N-n-n-number 12? That's me? This time has been duly noted and will be deducted from your salary. Thank you. - Ahhh! - Ahhh! You! You. Ohhh! No, no please don't hurt me. I traveled to the future for this? I don't hear any typing down their number 12. Quick, get out of the chair, I have to get back on schedule. Man, how do you let that doofus Mandark push you around? I don't know what you're talking about. Please leave. Just out of curiosity, did you become a wimp overnight or was it a gradual process. Oh I've always been like this. Wrong! I had yet to be beaten by that oversize head of a man but. You! You cower at the sound of his voice. Typing! See! You have ruined everything I have worked for, haven't you! I don't know who you are but please leave. You don't know who I am? You don't know who I am! I travel through space and time to see you and you can't even recognize your own flesh and blood! What? Yes, I am you. But it can't be. Can it? Typing. I'm sorry I wish I could talk but I'm very very busy. What possibly could you do here that is more important than talking to yourself. I hope you know that what I do here is very important. I designed these cubicles. I cannot believe this. Robots from the future come back in time to destroy me cos' I saved the future and then I travel in time to see how cool I am saving the future and here I find you. A pitiful excuse of a Dexter. The Neurotomic Protocore. Hello, what are these? Designs utilizing Neurotomic. An unlimited power producing pylon. Teletronic matter manipulation. Centralized neurotomic information distribution. These ideas are incredible. No no, those are nothing. You should see the new cubicle design I did. 10 by 10. Yes, I increased the cubicle space by 1 foot. Are you crazy! These plans can revolutionize the future. You are a real Dexter after all. Stop the typing. Stop the typing. Stop the typing! You are not a worker drone my friend.. You are not just a number. You are a genius! You have got a name. What is your name? 12. No! What is your name? T-t-twelve. No! What…is…your…name? De-De-De-De... Yes. Yes! De-De-De... Dexter? Again. Dexter? Again! Dexter! Yes! Dexter is the name of a lion a tiger a bear! Oh my! Now let's get the heck into the future and see how cool we are. Typing. Number 12! Hee, hee, hee. Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee. Hee, hee, hee. Haha ha! Haha ha! Hahaha! Hahahahaha! Hahaha! Hahahahaha! Hahaha! Hahahahaha! Boy oh boy the future. The future I can hardly wait. Oh, I think I'm going to be sick. It seems that my lab is back to its original order. Uh-uh, that is strange. I forgot how much I hate time travel. It seems that were surrounded by a very large pane. I'll say. Air! Can't breathe! Gotta get out! Gotta get out! Out! Out! Let me out! I gotta get it to work. Freedom! We're out. Hey this looks like a museum about my old stuff. Wow! Big Giant Dexo Robo. Man, me and this puppy have had quite a few adventures together. Whats this? Ptooie. Ptooie. Styrofoam. I did not build the giant Dexo Robo out of Styrofoam. This is not a fair representation of the genius that is Dexter. This is a piece of junk! Hey, what's with all the racket. Mandark? Ahhh! I'm typing I'm typing! I know that you Dexter and don't think I haven't forgotten what you did to me. I'm still gonna get you Dexter! What are you doing? I'm typing. We'll cut it out and look. There's nothing left of Mandark but his lame brain. I heard that! Lame brain. That's pretty funny. I wonder what it was that Mandark lost his head over. Oh, I heard that too! Oh, I'm warning you! What are you going to do think something bad? Why you... Come here and I'll teach you a lesson. You'll see, I'll be back on my feet and destroy you yet Dexter! Poo. What is all the ruckus in here? Who is causing all this? Oh! My gracious! Who could have done this? Who would want to destroy the homage to our all knowing and omnipotent leader Dexter! I would! Oh! My gracious it's you! It's both of you! All hail the great and powerful Dexters. Proof at last. Young naive cease this exultation at once and fetch us your most elegant coach. We require passage to see our future self the great and powerful Dexter! Yes, yes your grace, of course right away! Thought transference commencing in 3, 2, 1. Amazing, what is this? It's a Teletronicicly Manifested Bubble Transport. Teletronicicly Manifested. Yes, one merely has to think of something and poof the matter is Teletronicicly manifested. Where does this new science come from? Why you of course. That is the future you. See, I told you your idea's were genus. Dexters past, welcome to your future. Welcome to Xtopia. Thanks to your marvelous invention of the Neurotomic Protocore. All of your knowledge of science and technology is disbursed freely from your brain and into the brains of every inhabitant wearing a transference receptor. In turn causing universal wisdom, peace, and harmony. See I told you. We're here! The Centralized Neurotomic information and Power Distribution Pylon. Oh, isn't it fab! Well, this is as far as I go. The great one isn't for the likes of my lowly eyes. Good luck. It is just like in the blueprints. And look! The Neurotomic Protocore is at the heart of it all. We must be at the top running the whole show. I did not think it could happen but I am more of a genius than I already am. Shall we? Who dares disturbed the great and powerful Dexter! Once the profit signs upon the world. We are the Dexter's of the past. We have come from the past to find out how we save the future you're all knowing presence. Presents! I didn’t know it was my birthday. I'll be right down. Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh. Who put these stairs here! Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh. Ahhh! Ohh! My hip! Hello. Hi. Hello. Hum. Hello. Hay. What? Hello.

Yes, can you picture it, a world in dire need. Yes. A world in need of a hero. Yes. And there's only one man to do the job. Yes. Romance machina. Yes. One man with the strength, the technology, the rugged good looks. And that man is? Yes, yes, yes! Us! Yes, yes, yes. Do you remember? No! Apparently there's only one thing left to do. We must again traveling time back to the very time of our triumph. Back to see firsthand just how cool we've really are! Yes. Boy oh boy, I can hardly wait to see how cool I was. Come on hurry up. Times a wasting. Let's go. This is going to be great. He's not coming. - Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. - Don't you think you could move a bit faster. Think! I think I can. Here we go. Okay all right almost there I got it now. I'm in. I'm in. Thanks Billy. Coolness, here we come. Oh, what happened to the lab this time? Looks like a bomb hit. Hey look, oldie found a way out. It is nice to know some of us are still on the ball. Zzz. Zzz. Zzz. Here gramps, penthouse chop chop. Elevator up. 13th floor underwear, outerwear, n' out of here. Aw! Oh, what happened to the world this time? Looks likes a bomb hit. Does any of this ring a bell with you? Ding-dong Nope. Hay! People! Lets check it out! Geronimo! Come on men, lets see if any of these villagers can tell us what is going on. Pardon my good man but wouldst thou know 'where' and more importantly, 'when' we today? Anyone? Good gravy has everyone around here lost their minds? Fire, come out fire. What happened to everyone! What is wrong with you? What are you trying to do? We try to make fire come out of wood. Okay, step back watch closely. Yea! Woo! Fire! By order of the overlord. All fires are prohibited. the creation of fire is a punishable offense. Ahh. The overlords machine man! Way to go smart guy now we'll never know how cool we are coz' we're all going to be ionized. Let there be fire for all! You see I told you, I told you we were to be cool in the future. Did you see those moves! That wrench. That brawn! That beard. The dome. Hey yeah, what happened? Hey yeah, what happened? Dexter! Dexter! Dexter! Wow! Oh yeah man! Your as cool as I always wanted to be. Ah? Dexters? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we traveled forward in the time 'cause I heard I. I mean… We said the future. But he couldn't remember. So then we went back in time to find you and we did. And it was awesome. Time travel, hum... You boys will need to be filled in on a few things. Yeah, like what happened to the world? And who is science hoarding overlord. Mandark. Mandark! Mandark! Mandark! Many moons ago, Mandark and I were employed by the corporation as research scientist to develop new technologies for the betterment of the future. So naturally, as my genius produced a fountain of amazing ideas. A not so inspired Mandark grew more and more jealous. He began stealing my creations and presenting them as his own. As you may well remember. Grr. He soon gained favor with the executive hierarchy and was quickly promoted up through the ranks. And with one diabolical coup, Mandark overthrew and became the very President of the corporation himself. Then darkness fell. Somehow my most prized invention the Neurotomic Protocore fell into Mandark clutches. Oh my gosh, we left the core out in my cubicle. Mandark tried to employ the powers of the core but the incompetent fool set the positive flow to negative. And now corrupt energies of the core began to twist Mandark already crooked mind. Making him even more greedy insane than ever before. I could take it no more. To escape the perversion of my own science. I went underground. Literally. I dug a tunnel out from Mandark's tower. For years I dug and dug. Inching my way to freedom. But while I dug the negative Neurotomic energy swept the world. Numbing the minds of the people. Allowing Mandark to work is evil tentacles into every facet of technology and society. It was as though he just reached down and raked the earth clean. Hoarding all science all knowledge for himself. When I emerged I found this world broken and stupid. I did what I could to help but with the overlords robots enforcing terror across the land and very few resources at my disposal. It's been a fight just to survive. Aw, buck up hero we found the lab and we can all help. The laboratory!?! I had thought it lost forever. But with the power of the lab plus the genius of me times four equals, the cataclysmic collapse of the overlord empire of oppression! Yeah!Yeah! Yeah! To the laboratory. I'd like to take this time to pat myselfs on the back. Gentlemen, here's to another greatest work completed, for tomorrow we storm the castle! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Your overly lordness, proximity alarm, registered an armed assault vehicle on an attack vector. What? Imageizer on! How can this be? Science is forbidden to all. Only I have the knowledge to construct such a… Unless... Micro-scan. Magnify! Dexter with Dexter, Dexter, and Dexter. It isn't possible! It seems my old Nemesis has not only mysteriously resurfaced but has also found a way to enlist the aid of himself from other times! No matter. Let them come. I have a few surprises of my own. Mandark's castle is just over the next ridge. This is it Dexter's! We're going in. Mandark! Your mechanized minions are defeated. Now it's just you, me, me, me and me. So Dexter, you thought quadrupling your brain So MightyMike77020,ht quadrupling your brain power would be enough to defeat me! Well I think it's safe to even the playing field. Just like old times, eh? Yes, quite the reunion but... Reunion sh-union! I want my Neurotomic Protocore you gluttonous old hack! Never! - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah! Yar! Yar! Yar! - You old raisin. - You clod. - You smagegie. - You nincompoop. You ding dong. - Grr. - I ought a'. Haha-ha. Haha-ha. Ha-haha. Haa haa-haa haa-haa! Haa haa-haa haa-haa! Haa haa-haa haa-haa! Haa haa-haa haa-haa! Oh my! That's it! If we can reach the neurotomic flow controls and set it to positive, the protocore will revert back to normal undoing the mind numbing evil these mad Mandark's have unleashed. Ahhhh! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Oh? No! I've always wanted the core! No! I stole the core! No! The core is mine! No! Just because I'm bitter and jealous! Huh? Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Yes, go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go! ♥ Dee Dee. ♥ - Dee Dee! - Dee Dee! ♥ Dee Dee. ♥ ♥ Dee Dee. ♥ Dee Dee. ♥ Dee Dee. ♥ Dee Dee! Ooh, what does this button do? Nooo! I remember! I remember! Dee Dee was the one who saved the future! No way! That didn't just happen! I wanted to be the one who saved the future. Argh! That girl! I'll teach her to mess up my future savings. Yeah, we'll show her! Ooh, that little ding dong! I'll get her once and for all. Robots! Destroyed the one who saved the future! Well. That should take care of Dee Dee. It looks like the future is back on track. I've got a lot of cleaning up to do but with a positive flow of the core everything should work out fine. Well then, we should be getting back to our own times. Goodbye Dexter. Goodbye Dexter. Goodbye Dexter. Goodbye Dexter. Goodbye Dexter. Goodbye Dexter. Goodbye Dexter. Goodbye Dexter. Goodbye Dexter. Goodbye Dexter. Goodbye Dexter. Goodbye Billy. Boy, that isn't exactly what I expected, but I did turn out pretty cool in the future. Wait a minute I'm still here fighting those robots. But wait, Those are the robots I just built to get Dee Dee. While we're building the future. But now I'm about to destroy them. Before I even decide to go into the future. So that means when I came back. That means I came back too far. Back before I ever left. So I must have come... No I... Or they were... Aw, forget it. Time travel hurts my brain.
