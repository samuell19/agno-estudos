Okay, maybe try telling something interesting. BE KIND OR GO AWAY THANKS My God. Ok, this one ... - No, no! Seriously. - Seriously what? Seriously! Wait a second. What? Right. There is nothing funny about this situation. The guys are not strangers? I think people in general are. Exactly. Tell me about your philosophy men, women, and people. I think it's very easy generalization on my part. Men are ... seeking power. Women are looking for ... love. And children are seeking ... independence. - Where are you? - Ok! Hang in there. How old were you? I do not know, I was five. And what happened? Tonight? Do you remember? You know, just describe, tell how it went. I sat at the kitchen table, eating my potatoes and peas. Hey, how many months was his mother? She was about 8 and a half months ... - This is very pregnant. - It is. Very close to giving birth. And all I remember is look inside the room ... after hearing my mother scream. I got up, went to the door and looked inside ... and my father was kicking my mother's belly. And she walked away to the wall. And then she fell near the crib he had built ... for when the baby arrived. Then I remember being in hospital with my mother screaming in pain. And she just give birth, but the baby was dead. E. .. was a girl. And she was dead. The beating killed her belly. - Do not laugh at me. - No, I'm not laughing at you. I'm not laughing, I just do not know ... I do not know how it all went through. Do not even know. Well .. I do not know. I know this vai sound horrible, but ... When I was growing up, I even felt that ... I did not feel that I was human. - What? - You know. - What is? - What happened? What prompted this? I do not know ... Something like ... I was looking out the window and she told me not to look out the window. And she was ironing and ... She was ironing and ... she came to me and said: "Do not look out the window. I told you not to look out the window. " Then I remember this great iron ... coming towards me. How ... in slow motion ... I do not remember the pain, just remember this ... big and loud cry ... A. .. blood-curdling scream? It is. - You can not park here. - Okay. What are you doing? - Just digging. - Yeah, whatever. Come. What Mia said is really true? Do not be an idiot. On? Yes. Ok, well ... In the know at a party a few months ago. And this other girl had simply disappeared. Then she moved here and we are best friends ever since. Whatever. I think Mia has me as an example, you know? Why do you think ... I mean ... What are "friends"? "Friends" is the worst type shit show on TV. "Hmm .. Why do you think ... I mean ... " Like, your questions are so stupid. It's scary when a girl of 6 years ... sees a lot and knows your heart ... and you do not care for her. For me, it was just this disturbed person and ... I could not hate her. Do you know? All I know ... All I could think was I had to pity her. Because I know how my father she was and how she suffered ... So I could not hate her, because that was the only way ... Her vent your pain ... their frustrations, so ... I could handle the shit and everything else and tried to be strong. And say, "Hey, all right" ... And just hold on. There were times when I really I hated my mother. And I had thoughts of ... You know ... I do not mean "kill her" but just, you know ... push her and say: "Fuck you." Do you ever think, like ... perhaps at this point in your life ... say it, tell her how feel about all this? It's too late. It's too late for that, she ... She became, she is a different person now. - I do not even know her more. - But, Mia ... honestly ... It's like she erased everything and written in ink on top of Jesus. I mean, do not you think would make a difference if you said: "Look, this is what I think you did to me ... " - Know what I mean? - She would just ignore. Alright! Lets ignore it. - Let her ignore. - She would just ignore. I'm just saying ... I'm just saying that I would want her to know. I would want to say I feel for her. She would ignore ... Only coffee. Thank you. This part will not be seen by nobody but us three, right? Sure. Lie. Lie. Lie ... BE KIND OR GO AWAY THANKS NEVER NEVER NEVER GIVE UP It's strange that you're so unemotional when he talks about things like that. Well .. It is because I went through this ... over and over in my head and ... just ... Do you know? This has disturbed you? It's like a movie, you know? Yes, I cried. I cried all the tears. I stayed up all night ... unable to sleep. I cried until no more tears are left. From what you cried? Mostly, for my father. Because he was the one who really understood me. He was the only ... who knows ... who loved me. And it does not hurt me. E. .. Do you know? Although he made these terrible things ... he was a person very curious to me. A very interesting person. He was very intelligent and very artistic. And I knew it was so like him. Nothing like my mother ... When you're a guy, you ... You see his father in him? No. Sorry ... Ok, but, I mean, it's just that ... I will not talk about it. Ok It's just ... I do not know who will see it. If someone is going. About what you want talk then? I do not know. What do you want to talk? Let's talk about ... All I knew was ... it hurt. And the second time he penetrated me, and I was crying, it hurt so much. And I thought: "My God, it should be pleasurable. " And that brochou me immediately. And I looked down and saw this pool of blood ... out of the way of my legs. And I just thought: "Oh, my God." And his name was Jim and he was ... And I just ... "Oh, my God ... looks like you killed someone these sheets ". And he said: "It is ...". Apparently he really loved me and asked me to marry. So of course, I let immediately by another guy. How old were you? I was nineteen. You were a virgin with nineteen? Yes. They say that if you are a virgin and lose his virginity ... to his first love, that after experiencing ... the loss of her virginity, you just hate that guy ... because you want him back and not realizes how much he wanted ... how was precious, until vai. It did not hurt? I do not know. Well .. Well, I think that is quite different for men. Do not you think? I mean, I think the same. I think that guy not feeling your pain. - No. - The guy who I was ... - I did not feel my pain. - They just think they're earning. Exactly! He was just thinking about having sex. I'll only date women going forward. What do you think attracts the guys who ... they just want to eat you and you leave? Pardon? I mean ... it is a quality attractive in a guy? You search it? Type someone ... You look at someone and think: "He just wants to earn"? No, I do not think it's attractive. I find disgusting. I look for personality in a guy. - He must have a sense of humor. - You know, I'd say that ... I could not care less on the appearance of a face. I do not have a type. Do not care about height. I do not ... As long as they are taller than me. I know many guys they have giant egos. And you know what? I think there great art in humility. Do not you think, Mia? I mean ... There is a great art to be humble. Even if it's beautiful, even if be smart, whatever. Just receive a compliment and say ... "Yeah ...", instead of: "Yeah, I am too." I could not do that. Know what I mean? You understand me? No, I'm not understanding. You're being totally confused. No, I'm not. Mia knows what I'm saying. Ok Maybe it's a subtle feminine language. What we are saying is that know a lot of guys ... ok, I'm saying. Ok Wait a minute. - Here's what I'm saying. - What? I know many guys who think they are so delicious ... they are the best thing ... Whatever. Whatever. Perhaps they are beautiful and intelligent, or maybe smart and beautiful ... Whatever! I'm just saying ... I agree. When ... a person is humble, a man or a woman ... so this is a very quality greater than having a huge ego. Now I make sense? Ok .. Let me ask you a question. - Right? - Yes Ok, so ... Ask the question. Ok So ... If it were to confer all people ... - With whom he had intimate ... - Yes - In the last five or ten years ... - Yes How were their ideals? How dovetailed humble in that category? Well, no, obviously. Because if there was an ideal I would be with that person. I do not know how many people I slept. I'd say something close two hundred faces. - Two hundred? - It is. It is. Do not worry; I was safe with them. You know, condoms and everything else. - Rubber gloves. - Rubber gloves can say. Nonoxynol-9. Whatever. It is at this point two hundred guys and about three girls. - Three girls? - It is. You know everyone's name? You know everyone's name? Man, if they expand, a line all these chicks together ... could reach the moon God is dead and no one cares. I did not mean anything by it. Just shut up once, ok? Ok I do not believe I'm crying ... I can not even remember the last time i ... How do you feel? I feel ... well. Not so good, but you know ... Honestly. It is not good ... you know ... just ... just be myself for a change. Who are you generally? Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. - Yes? - John, I love that cat, man. Yeah, the cat is good. Still to drink? Should bring your girls, man. It really was thinking to invite them to eat. In order to cook? I had this ... amazing story that should tell tonight ... - And that should be a part ... - Mia, think we should go soon? Just give us the short version. My mother locked me in the basement. I regained consciousness. I escaped. I said to everyone: "Get out." I ran away. I began my own life. I made many mistakes, but learned from them. And now I am a strong and independent woman. Mia! We gotta go! Just do not hate me because I'm beautiful. I do not hate ... you just confuses me. Mia! Exciting. Exciting. - We gotta go. - Exciting. Animal! Like me. What is exciting? Come on! Come on! Come on. That is immortalized on tape forever. We are terrible actresses. No, we are brilliant actresses! Ok Good is good enough. As I give the zoom it, John? Here ... So much effort and so little recognition.
