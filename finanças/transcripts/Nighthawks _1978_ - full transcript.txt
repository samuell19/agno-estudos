Do you feel like a drink now? - I really do, yes. - Well. Oh, cheers. - There you are. - What are you drinking? - Martini. - Oh, I like that sometimes. Didn't think of it today though. Brought up a beer, ever since I started. All those years as a student I suppose. - Mmm. - Where were you at college? - Lincoln. - Yeah? - Where were you? - Southampton. - How nice. - I met Steven there, my husband. - Did you? - Yeah, cause he was there same time as me, and then I went teaching and he did an extra year. - What's he doing now? - Cause I've done a year in a Sixth Form college. Did you know that? - No. - Oh, yeah, well in Southampton I was a year in Sixth Form college. What does he do now? - Mmhmm. - Oh he's in a Polytechnic teaching others to teach. (laughs) - Oh. (television in background) What else place did you have? - It was just a one room kitchen. - On your own? - No, no. Sharing with a friend of mine. Yeah. But Emylyn is just like any other big northern town really, you know? It's like London except (mumbles) (laughs) - Do you find much to do? - Well there's nothing to do out there really. There's one club you can go to. Which is a real growl, you know. - Did you know the friend before you went there? - Uh, yeah, yeah. When he was at college you see, so we managed to find this place in the paper and we moved in. - You used to go out there together? - Go where? - Go out to bars and stuff. - Oh no, he was straight. - Oh, was he? - Yeah, it was a shame really, cause he was a nice guy. - Well you fancied him. - Yeah, a little bit. (laughs) - Did he know? - I don't know whether he knew it, I think he must've though because well just some things he said sometimes you know? And he knew that I went out a lot to gay, to the gay place. - So it didn't come to anything? - No, no. Well he was bringing his girlfriends back then, it was very frustrating. Wake up one morning and there's, his girlfriend lying there. (chuckles) - Should we go to bed? - You want to stay here tonight? - Mmm hmm. - Well I'd rather you didn't actually tonight. If you don't mind, cause I want to get some sleep. I would like to be on my own. - I just thought it would be nice for us to be together. - Yeah, but I just like to be on my own tonight, so - Well maybe tomorrow night. Oh no I can't see you tomorrow night. What about Friday or Saturday? - Friday. Um, actually Friday I'm meeting an old friend. Yeah, he's coming down from (mumbles) so we're going out for a bit of a booze up. (chuckles) - And Saturday? - Probably the same thing. They only drink us up there you know. (laughs) - Well give me a call, will you? - Yeah. - I think this is a person walking darkened area, and there's not much going on here nowadays cause they put in container shipper. I guess most people who were working at the docks must be living around in these high rise (mumbles) Cause they were new to the docks, and you didn't have to catch buses or anything. This is one of the direlects warehouses and their the same problem. It's got a garden (mumbles) turned into offices and so on but, it also gonna be broken down. - Oh Lois is five and Emma's three. Lois is the bad guy, she's the big one. She's um, I think she's super. But she can be very difficult. Emma is much more amiable, and Steven gets on, you know, with Emma, very very well, but sometimes I think he's a bit hard on Lois, see. - Emma's the one we're going to pick up? - Yeah, we're going to pick her up now. Expect you'll like her, you're used to kids, little ones. - Yeah. (70's dance music) * you know I'm high * Oh, I'm high on love * you send me high * high on a cloud of love * like a giant (mumbles) * make it seem like nothing at all * there is nothing to (mumbles) * happy at all - Very good how are you? - I'm alright thanks, how are you? - Okay. Just come from the out room. - Happier? - Mmmhmm. - Any good? - No. (laughs) Won't be here otherwise. How long have you been here? - About an hour. - Really? - Yeah. - And you're still here? - Yeah. (whispers) - Anyone you fancy? (70's dance music) - Where do you work? - I work in a bar. - Oh. Do you get free night? - Mmm. - Tough work isn't it? Bar work I mean. (70's dance music) Well it's came to that (mumbles) to say goodnight in the streets. (mumbles) (70's dance music continues) - Mountain kings (mumbles) sir. - Mountain kings? Can you describe it to us? - Well Scotland has new buildings, not so scruffy as London. - You mean it's cleaner? - Yes. - How would any of you feel about moving out? Moving out to a new town and leaving London. Olly? - Well I don't particularly like London. Because it's too closed in. Too much buildings and everything all closed in, so it's like you're in a trap. And when you're in, out somewhere out of London, you are so free. (mumbles) - How many of you actually get out of London? Do you go out of London very much? Ian? - In the summer I go out of London. - Where do you go? - (mumbles) - I was going (mumbles) at school, but (mumbles) - Were you? Oh left, sorry. (laughs) Trying to concentrate on three things at once. You're gonna park in and have a cup of tea with us aren't you? - Alright, I'd really like to. - Yeah, it'd be nice. You see if I don't set the work to do in class, I have to spend so long preparing the lesson, cause I've got to know, you know, I just can't feel competent enough at the moment anyway to just stand up there and (mumbles) I like to have you know, notes in front of me. Do you have notes when you're teaching? - Yes, sometimes. Have you got any milk? - Uh, yeah its on the drain right there behind you, okay? Terrible stain here you know, you must think this is disgusting. - Sit down, have a rest, food's ready. (laughs) - Yeah, I'll just chop these up then I'll be okay, once Steven gets in. He usually (mumbles) half past six. - You all eat together? - No, I'll give the girls something, and he puts them in the bath when he comes home. (mumbles) he puts them in the bath, reads them a story and I've got supper ready when he comes down. Okay? - Alright. - Alright. - I'll take it in. - Yeah you take that in, - You take the glasses. - Yeah, I'm just gonna do (mumbles) for the girls, alright? - Alright. (70's dance music) - Great, thanks. - I put two sugars in it. - Yeah that's fine. - I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name. - Neil. - Neil. - That's great. How long have you had the place? - About four years. - You've personalized it quite a bit, it's very homey. - Where do you live? - I live near the Angel, near work. I work just off (mumbles), so it's very convenient. - Do you live on your own? - No, I share with three guys. Three other guys. - All gay? - No, no. At least they don't act it. (chuckles) - They know you are? - No, there's no way I can tell them, because you know, they're very nuff, they're all, it's all kinds of football, booze and birds, you know. And um, if you don't like the first two, then you're a bit strange. And I mean they're acquired taste, but if you don't like birds, which after all those are the fundamental role of the male, the species, you know I mean, you're not even human as far as they're concerned. - Where are you from? - Originally? - Yeah. - From Bolton, in (mumbles) to Manchester. - Oh yeah. When did you come to London? - Um, about 7 weeks ago. Something like that. - What brought you down? - Well, I was hung up up there about being gay and not being able to do anything about it. So, I had seen in the Sunday papers, I had seen articles on gay pride parties in London, announce all of the gay prostitution racket. So I decided there must be something here for me. So I just moved down. - Was that what you came down for? - For prostitution? No. (laughs) No I met a couple of guys that did the deli circuit, but I never got into it myself. What do you do? - I teach. - You teach. I recognize the geography books. - Yeah. - Memories of school. - I think we should go to bed. - Yeah. Shall I leave this down? - Yeah sure, if you're finished. Do you go down to the streets very often? - Uh, I've been about four times. You see I haven't been on the scene for such a short time. I like to try a lot of new places out, but if I have a regular I suppose you could call the streets the reg, you know, the regular place to go. - I go there quite often. - Yeah. - Have you tried any other places? - Yeah, (mumbles), rainbow rooms, a few other places I can't remember the names of them. I just like music, I like the dance music, you know where they can't have, I like to enjoy myself, have a drink, you know, just mix (mumbles) - I noticed you liked those. - Yeah. - I was watching you. (laughs) - Is that the only thing I do normally? Just um, - What do the guys think, where you live? When you go out? Don't you tell them when you're going? - Well I go up to the pub with them you see, and then they don't really enjoy these girls, so I mean I can just say I'm going down to the club or going out with a girlfriend. And they just accept it, they don't ask any prying questions really. - That must be very difficult. - Not really, I've just got to do it. - Come. - What's in the pillow? - Straw. (chuckles) - Should I put this anywhere? - Yeah, just put it there. What time do you have to get up? - Well, I normally start work by nine. - That's fine. - I think I'll treat myself to one of these when I get a bit of money. - To one of what? - A quilt. - They're good, nice. I make my bed very easy in the morning, especially if you're in a hurry. - Yeah. - Can I drop you just here by the light? - Yes, sure. - The Tube is just around the corner. - Go ahead, thanks a lot. Alright so you'll be at Back Street's next weekend? - Yeap, - Alright, I'll see you then. - Okay. - Okay, see you. - I suggest you make three columns. One for the name of the tin or the packet, which is what we call the brand name. Brand name. The second column I want you to put exactly what that product is, whether its cheese, whether its yogurt, or what other kind of milk product it is. And the third column should tell where it comes from. Now you should find that written on the tin or the packet. Have you got that? You know what to do. - I used to go to the pictures years ago you know, a girl I used to live with actually used to get up Sunday mornings and go. And sit in the front row, have you ever done that? - Mmm. - What was the (mumbles) the bag of popcorn sounds great. (chuckles) Well, I haven't seen her in ages actually. She got married. It's funny actually because she married a guy in the same year as Steven. We seem to have lost touch lately. Well not lately, since we came to London really. Don't seem to have, made the same sort of friends (mumbles) You know, when I was at home sort of where I come from, you know I told you, - Mmm hmm. - I came from a very small village, well the sort of school we went to all the kids came from round about and we used to go , after we all went to college it was (mumbles) to go home for the holidays and we used to go drinking together but, don't know I suppose its life but, don't know where any of them are now except one person. - So you don't normally go out on your own at all? - No I don't. I picked the wrong night too. - Why? - Well it's Thursday isn't it? Steven has squash tonight and I had completely forgotten. - So he's staying in, is he? - He's not pleased. (laughs) It's not funny actually, - Sorry. - Well it wasn't funny at the time, that's why I came in all breathless and (sighs) - Did you have a rile? - No. No we didn't have a rile, but I mean he just thought I was very inconsiderate. For the first time in a year I decide to go out, how very inconsiderate of your duty. You know I play squash on Thursday nights. - I know. - Well I didn't do it on purpose, he made me so mad I wish I had done it on purpose, but there you are. Yeah, he's okay though really. It's just, sort of, like I said you know, we've been in London six years, and there's probably maybe, you know, a (mumbles) Well I can't always blame every body else cause I haven't made friends here, you have to make an effort for yourself, don't you? - Well, you're out anyway. (laughs) - Yeah. Do you get so close when you first meet somebody, you get so close, you sort of I suppose you let people drop. Is that it do you think? - Could be, I don't know. - Would you ever live with anybody? - Oh yeah, the last one was about three months. But you know my place is very small. You start getting under, under each other's feet. I mean, coming in and wanting to do some work, you want to be on your own and the television is on. It's alright sometimes, but when it happens all the time, so um, I sort of put an end to it. And he left. When in fact I asked him to leave, which wasn't very easy. I didn't want to sort of chuck anyone out, but it just became too impossible. It lasted for about three months, there were some good times. But, that was three months ago. Oh there was another one, lasted for about a year. We didn't actually live together, but he had a place of his own and I had my place. And I used to stay there and he used to stay with me. But he went back to Australia. So I'm living on my own at the moment. - Pat's from Australia isn't she? - Yeah. I am seeing someone at the moment. - You mean, a boyfriend? - Yeah. - What's his name? - Mike. (slow music) (chuckles) - It would be nice to meet you for a drink after (mumbles) one night. If you'd like. - Yeah. - Or we could go see a film, or go for a meal. - That'd be nice, yeah I'd like that. - What about Thursday? - Okay. - Where's a convenient place to meet you? - The (mumbles) Um, what about the Salisbury? - Yeah, that's fine. Should we say about seven? - Yeah, 7, 7:30pm. - Great. Alright, I'll see you on Thursday at 7. - Yeap. - Ciao. - Bye bye. (closes door) (chuckles) - Now I've got the (mumbles) - Actually quit his job. - Yeah. (laughs) (people talking) - Hello? Hello is that St. Martin's? I'm trying to get in touch with one of your students. Peter Holland. Oh really? Is it possible to leave a message? I see. And what time does the switchboard open? Okay, well I'll ring then. I'm sorry to bother you. Thanks very much, bye bye. Hello? Hello may I speak to Neil please? Thank you. Hello, Neil? This is Jim. Yeah, um, we met in the streets. Hi, I'm alright thank you. How are you? I just wondered what you were doing. I mean tonight. Oh will you? I just wondered if you know, you'd like to go for a drink. Or maybe, go on somewhere. Well I'm in the Salisbury. Its on St. Martins lane. Well, would you like to meet me here? Or we could go for a meal. Well I'll just wait for you here if you'd like. An hour? Yeah, yeah, that's great. Okay, see you. Bye bye. - It starts when I go home, really. Cause I sort of, you know my dad picks me up from the station and driven back. And my mother's got me staking chips away too for me. She just stuffs food down me. Mind you I've only been home once, since I moved to London. Though just for a weekend. - Do you write home a lot? - No, my mom telephones me. Bout every Sunday, two o'clock I'm waiting by the phone until the phone calls. (chuckles) - And if you're not there she wants to know where you've been. - Well no, if I'm not gonna be there I'll ring her up on Saturday. Just so she doesn't think there's anything wrong. I'm going home this weekend, on Saturday then coming back the next Saturday. Then going up for Christmas. Which will all be great I'm sure. - Yeah I reckon I'll be going home for Christmas. - Where'd you come from? - From Redding. - Redding. Where's that? - That's about 40 miles out of London. - Yeah. - Quite easy in the car. - Do you see a lot of your mom and dad? - Not as much as I used to. - Why is that? - Don't know really, just keep putting it off, going back. It's a difficult one. I mean, its very convenient. I should be able to go very often, I mean its easy to get there, I've got the car. But I make it, if possible, every three or four weeks. - Yeah so they don't know you're gay? - No. Have you told yours? - No, no I'd like to, but it's, you never know what they're going to say. You know its a bit hard. My brothers keep asking to come down to London but I wouldn't know what to do with them if they came down here really. You know, but as it is at the moment I've got an excuse because the house is too crowded. - Mmm hmm. - Wouldn't be able to fit them in. (70's dance music) - Oh hi Peter. What happened to you? Yeah, I waited. For about an hour. No it's alright. I just thought, No it doesn't matter. How are you? Yeah, I'm fine thank you. Well I have to do a bit of work after school. Only to about seven. Eight o'clock yeah that's fine. Well it'll take me about half an hour. Yeah well I'd come, I'll just come (mumbles) About eight, okay yeah. And you're alright are you?

Are these clean? Can I have these? - Mmm, take one. - Got some tea. - Won't please you, - Does your friend want some tea? - Mmm. - Okay, couple of minutes. It's 10 o'clock. - Oh shit. (mumbles) - Mmm. - I've got to go, I'm late. - Stay for tea. - I'm supposed to go in at nine. - Go on ahead. I'm tired. - You'll stay in bed all day won't you? (chuckles) - Yeah probably. I'll go in at mid-day. - Alright, one tea then I must go. Sorry I'm late everyone. - Where have you been? (students bickering) - Look I said I'm sorry I'm late. You're late quite often, alright? - We can sit here (mumbles) - Yes, (mumbles) (students talking) Alright, settle down. (mumbles) the lesson. April, settle down.

Go on, I'd like you to come. Have a few drinks. Come in here first. - Well you have to do that. (laughs) If you come in here and have a few drinks. Is Peter in? - No he doesn't live here anymore. - Oh, he's moved? - Yes. - Have you got his address? - I think it's somewhere, do you want to come in? - No, it's alright. I'll just wait here. - Okay, I'll be a couple of minutes. This is it. - Oh thanks. Is there no phone? - No. - Okay, that'll do. - Okay? - Yeah, thanks very much. - Okay. - Bye bye. - Cheers.

I was with Paul. - Oh yes. - It's nice to see you, how are you? - I'm alright, thank you. - Good. I saw Paul last week, can't believe he's going off to Germany. I think he left yesterday to be on his tour. He'll be in Hamburg over Christmas. What are you doing for Christmas? Are you staying in London? - I haven't decided yet. - Well I've had one of those days. I'm supposed to meet some musicians coming for recording, and they got lost at the airport. Would you like a drink? - No thanks, I'm going to meet someone. - Oh you sure? - Yeah. I better get going. - Alright, well nice to see you. - See you again. - See you again, yes. Buh-bye. - Bye.

Have you got a pen? - Yeah. (clears throat) Maybe we go out to the theater and out, then for dinner or something. You do like theater don't you? - Mmm hmm. - 3-0-3-0? - Yeah. - I'll give you both my numbers just in case you can't get through. You know, whatever time of the day it is. - I sometimes do a bit of work over the weekend, you know preparing for the next week. So, - Well I hope you're not doing much this weekend, cause I'd really like to see you again. - Well maybe I should give you a ring on Thursday and arrange something? - Well I hope you would. - Now I really must go because I've got to go home and have a shave and get ready. - You can shave here. Cause I can drive you back to your flat. - No, I've got to go back there and collect books, and collect my car. And then go to work, I may as well, you go in the opposite direction to me anyway. - Well it doesn't matter, I don't have to be at work til a much later time anyway. - It'll just make a change going on the Tube. - Well alright. - I'm looking forward to it. - Okay. - Now I really must go, I'm going to be so late. - You will call Thursday won't you? - Yes sure, yeah. - (mumbles) - It was nice seeing you. - Nice seeing you. - I'll be in touch. - Alright, bye. - Bye bye. - From any two open areas describe the process of renewal which is taking place, and the problems encountered. - [Student] How long do we got for this one? - Normally you'd have 45 minutes, you have the rest of the double period. If you need anything, yes? - Does this have to be in at the end of the lesson? - Yes, please. - Are you going to the dance tonight Mr. (mumbles) (laughter) - I don't know I haven't thought about it. Now get on with the question, I've got work to do. - You never appear. - Caroline, - What? - Get on with it. - I can't do it. - Oh come on, don't be awkward. I had a rile with Steven this morning about it. - Why is he gonna babysit or something? - Yeah, he wants to go out but I said I was going out and, you know, I just thought you were coming. - Well (mumbles) a drink. - Yeah. (70's dance music) - Oh fuck off, you stupid bitch. Just leave it out would ya? Just had enough of the whole evening. Bloody school dance, I didn't wanna go to the bloody school dance in the first place. Do you want me to get you a taxi? - No, Jim. - Alright. (slow suspenseful music) - What's where all this on? - I didn't want to go to the school dance in the first place I didn't want to get drunk and I didn't want to go to Richard's bloody party. A lot of people thought we were together. - What are you talking about? We were together. - We weren't together. I wouldn't have gone at all if you hadn't gone on and on about it. - What is it? Is it me? Or has something else upset you? Your boyfriend? - What boyfriend? - I thought you had a boyfriend, Mike. - I don't see Mike anymore. Anyway, he wasn't really my boyfriend, I just saw him four or five times. Anyway I'm seeing someone else now. - What's his name? - Neil. I told you about the guy I lived with for about three months didn't I? - Who? - His name is Tim. He was looking for somewhere to live and I invited him to come and stay with me. - Where did you meet him? - In a pub. He was quite a good looking guy, an actor. Well I thought he was quite good looking. And for the first two weeks, it was really good. I mean I really enjoyed him being there, on the weekends we'd go off somewhere. We didn't go out very much, we stayed in most of the time. I really used to look forward to coming home from school, cause he'd be there. I just got used to it. It was quite nice I think, someone there. - Yeah. - But after about three weeks I'd come home and he wasn't there. I mean he was out, there'd be a note left saying "I've gone to see friends" or gone to see his brother. Or he was looking for work. So I'd stay in and do some work myself and wait for him coming home. And then one night he didn't come home, he phoned about 12 o'clock and said he missed his train, and he was staying with his brother. So I said "Fine, I'll see you tomorrow." Well I couldn't sleep that night, I mean, I didn't know whether to believe him or not. And it became a regular thing, this staying away. And there wouldn't be any note and there wouldn't be a phone call. And he'd stay away four or five nights a week. And then it got really bad, and the nights he stayed were as bad as the nights he was away because I couldn't talk about it to him. It became really difficult. And all that time I would say "You mustn't be jealous, You mustn't get possessive, you have no rights on this person whatsoever." But I was getting really jealous, I just, I couldn't sleep at night because of it. So I just said to him one night I can't stand it anymore, I've had enough. And I was going on a school trip, I was taking some kids to France, so I said "Well you know, when I get back I would rather you weren't here." And he said "alright" So I went on this trip but didn't really enjoy it, I mean I was thinking about him all the time. And when I got back he wasn't there. The spare keys were on the kitchen table and there was a note left. Immediately I went out and looking at all the bars, looking for him, trying to find him. I ended up just getting pissed I didn't see him at all. And then I bumped into him about a week later, and we didn't have anything to say to each other. So I stayed in a little after that, I didn't go out at all. Just stayed in and did work. And then I got in to the habit of going to the bars again. - What do you actually do in these bars? I mean, what are they like? - Well the bars, in the (mumbles) - Yeah. - Well they're just like ordinary pubs or discotheques. I mean you've been to a discotheque haven't you? - Well gosh, not for absolutely years, I was think of teeny boppers going to disco's. (laughs) I mean you dance, do you? - Yes. - And you usually meet somebody? - Usually. Well no not always, I mean sometimes I don't particularly want to meet anyone I just want to talk to friends but, yeah I usually meet someone. Well I met Mike there. I saw him for about three or four times after that. - As, sort of make a date or something do you? - Yeah. - Oh. - After Tim I met quite a few people. There was Francisco, he was a waiter. Quite a bit difficult though because he worked very odd hours I mean he was working most in the evenings. And he didn't speak very much English, and I didn't speak Spanish. That lasted for about two or three weeks. Well then there was a guy called David, he was an architect. I saw him for about three weeks. And then Roger, and then there was a guy called Paul, he was a teacher. I still see him quite a lot. And Nick, he's one of my best friends, I see him all the time now. Oh before Nick, there was a guy called George. Then there was a guy called Patrick, then Mike. - Gosh, aren't you confused? I mean, sorry, but I'm so sure I would be dreadfully confused if I was, so many people you know going, I mean I'm just looking at it from, the way I'm used to being I suppose. I've got Steven and the girls and a few close friends and, that's you know I mean, that's what I sort of, - Well it's different for you, isn't it? I mean you've got someone. - Yes. - As far as I can gather Steven doesn't particularly want you to go out and meet people. I don't have anyone, I can go out whenever I want to. - I just don't think I would know what I was doing, I think I'd be worrying and don't you get anxious about whether you're going to see these people again or not? (mumbles) - I know I can, I mean some of the times when I was living with Phil, and with Tim, they were very difficult. But I suppose I got a lot out of those relationships, but I don't discount the other relationships, the shorter term wise. I mean I still see these people, I'm still friends with them - Yeah. - And if things don't work out right, I mean if it just doesn't work out, I mean you can always pull out of the relationship don't you? - You mean just like that? - Yes, well don't get tied down. - But I mean, what if the other person maybe is by that time, perhaps become you know, very fond of you? - Well then its a bit difficult isn't it? - Do you think that's fair? I mean to go in something without you know thinking it, I'm sorry but it just seems to me that maybe it's going into things without giving it, you know, without giving it enough thought, defining the situation. I think its a bit dangerous. - Yes it can be some times. But I mean I really enjoy going, I just enjoy going out on my own, without any ties, not knowing who I'm going to meet, where I'm going to end up. - I think you must have to be very strong not to end up feeling rejected. I mean you say you can pull out but I mean, I suppose there are times when other people want to pull out. (whistling) - Two coffees please. - (mumbles) - (mumbles) A lot of people (mumbles) down the street around the corner, so I sort of tag along. And I went down in to this kind of cellar, paid some money to go in, and I was really really shocked, I mean it was just, just full of men. Dancing together. - And you were surprised? - Surprised, yeah I was, I just didn't think that places like that existed. And then someone came on and said "Would you like to dance?" I mean, I really had to think about that, and I thought "Well, I've never done that before. I've never been in that kind of situation." Then I thought "Well, you know that's what you come for." Everyone else is, so I did dance, and it was very strange because I had never, sort of had that physical contact with anyone like that before. And then someone asked me if I'd like to go back home with them, and I said "Yeah." And I ended up in a bedsit in Paddington. Woke up in the morning, I felt I don't know what I felt really. I suppose I felt relieved. - Mmm. - Relieved that I had actually done it after all that time, I had done it. And I started going to the club regularly, and going to the pub as well. Meeting other men, you know men that I just didn't really have anything in common with except they were gay and I was there with them. - Mmm. What about the girlfriends? - Oh I was still seeing lots of girls, going out with them and sleeping with them. But it became like I was sort of leading a double life. - Yeah. So you stopped seeing the girls. - Well gradually yeah, I mean I just saw more and more boyfriends I suppose. - Yeah. But people at school don't know you're gay, do they? - Well Pat knows, - Yeah. - and Ralph knows. - And I know. - And you know. - Yeah. - I don't know why it always seems so strange, I mean it's always such a big deal to tell anyone. - Mmm. - But it shouldn't be, it should be the easiest thing in the world to sort of tell someone, it always becomes such a big issue. I suppose it's because people just never never, never think you are, they just don't think that I might be gay. - But it's a good feeling when you have told somebody. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Well I'm glad I told you. - So am I. (people talking) - Hello. - Oh hi, how are you? - I'm okay, thanks, and you? - Yeah, alright. - A little bit better than the last time I saw you. - Oh yeah, I was in a bit of a stake that night. (chuckles) - What are you doing tonight? - Nothing, just enjoying a drink. - (mumbles) drink. - Mmm. And you? - I wasn't thinking of staying here, got a party to go to actually. - A party? - Yes, if you're in the mood. - I think I've had my fill of parties. - Who you? Well it's a quiet thing, just a few people. It's in a very interesting place in south London. On the river, it's one of the old warehouses, its been converted to a studio. Won't be many people there, very relaxed. Don't ask me about the art, don't know anything. - You don't know about, - Oh that's my, that's my favorite. That is beautiful. - That's not here. - No it's not, I don't know where it is actually. It's lovely. What do you want to drink? - Anything that's like wine. Not if its sweet. - Okay. - I never remember these associations. (laughter) - Cheers. - Hello, John, yes hi john. - How are you? - Very well. This is Dorrit. - Hello. - Hello. - She works for the Daily Telegraph. - Dorrit? - Dorrit. - Like Dickens. - You've got the name of from her father, who used to read Dickens a lot. - Oh really? - Yes. (laughs) - Oh very pleased to meet you. - Radio, get it right. (laughs) - Yeah. - This is Jim. - Hello. - How do you do? - Nice to meet you. - And Dorrit. - How do you do? - How do you do? - From Denmark, I've been telling Jim about your paintings, are they here? - Yes, yes. - Oh you must see them. - I'd really like to see them. - Alright, come on. - Okay. - You've got a drink? - Yes. - So you're (mumbles) - Yes, the paintings really, - Is this your studio? - No no, the paintings are in transit. They're on their way to America. It's a very small show, I hope to have a big one in London at some stage, but it's a matter of just getting the work done, so must be spend about two years, yet. Doin that work, no no Guy (mumbles) he knows all about it, I know nothing about it at all. - You just paint. - I just do that, yes. This is the couch one, the dear old couch. We've been together for two years now. Found it in a shopping (mumbles) gate. Some think nice and soft and lumpy, this one here isn't finished yet. Would you like to have a look at it? I just brought it along to show Stuart. There's gonna be a lot more in it yet, spilled coffee and dead birds, things like that. And this is a bit of litter, that I picked up the other day in a Tube station in bank. This is, a bit obsessive, but the thing about arranging this is a bit tricky. Have to do it by chance, so I just chuck it over my shoulder and as it falls, you see it arranged itself and I work it on from the next day. (laughs) Like (mumbles) - Sorry to butt in, but are you the painter? - Yes. - I really am very interested in that painting, I think its absolutely beautiful You know I think it's, and the work is so detailed, all the sort of colors and the fabric and the little details. Are you just, you were just talking about it, - Yes. We just happened to find a bit of (mumbles) paper on the floor. - Oh I see, rather like in this one, - Yeah. Yeah. - Oh I see. I noticed for instance in this you know, you even got the detail of what's inside the bag, and, - Yes, yeah. And that's a sweet wrapper from the tape gallery. A sugar wrapper. - What's in this paint frame? - Just a bit of newspaper. (people talking) (laughter) - Are you alright? - Yeah, I'm alright just gonna look at the view, - Oh alright. - See you later. (people talking) - [Voiceover] As he was making nice things, that were as critical as they could be. - [Voiceover] This is a friend of ours, who used to be a filmmaker. (people talking) - [Voiceover] I think you are very brave. (people talking) - [Voiceover] Yes, she must have. Yes. (laughter) - How you doing? - Alright thank you. - Get on alright with Peter? - Yeah, he's really nice. Have you seen his work? - No, I haven't seen it actually. - It's lovely. - Those are the ones going to America? - Yes, he said. He said Stuart's in (mumbles) - Yes that's right, he's organizing the exhibition. In Los Angeles, in two weeks. - Yeah. How long have you known Stuart? - Oh, three years. And we've been together for two. - Where did you meet? - Ah, personal introduction. I met him through a friend. At a dinner party. - You were introduced? - Yes. (laughs) It was act for charity, cause I was feeling lonely at the time. And, (mumbles) said "Come over, there's somebody I'd like you to meet." And Stuart was there, and away we went. - I had a feeling you were living together, but I wasn't sure if that was the situation. - Oh well, its a bit more complicated then that. I mean I'm not sure of it myself, anymore. - He travels a lot? - Yes, he always has, his job. But he has a heck of a social life as well, he's always out. And he's, that sort of person that can live in several places at the same time. I mean he's got stuff at my flat, he's got stuff here, he sleeps here, a couple of other places. So maybe I won't see him for a week at a time. - How'd you find that? - I can't really cope with it. - I lived with someone for about three months, I had to ask him to leave at the end. - Did you have to? - Yeah, my flat's very small, and there are times I just need to go my own to work, and I asked him to leave. It wasn't very pleasant. - I'm the opposite, I need to have somebody there. - Did you go out very much with Stuart? - Yes, we did everything together. Well, theaters and parties. Things like that, we didn't (mumble) on the scene very much. - I found I used to go out even more then, when I was living with someone because it was just too confined in that flat. Just to be there all the time, we used to go out go to clubs a lot together. - Oh we went out because we wanted to. I go out now because I have to. (sighs) Enjoying the party? - Yeah its alright. You? - Yes, would you like to stay? I should talk to some people actually while I'm here. - Well you know, you feel free, - And I thought we might stay for about an hour, and then we can do something else. Would you like to come back to my place afterwards? - Yeah, okay that'd be nice. - Yes? (students talking) - Alright, those in the back settle down. We won't be able to do very much this lesson, Mr. Benson is away and we have another class in. My class will get on with their own work, the rest of you can read. If you haven't got a book you're gonna have to go to the library. Will you keep quiet. So if you have any questions, put your hands up. (students talking) Yes, Christopher? - Is it true that you're bent? (laughter) (cheers) - Do you mind repeating the question, Christopher? - Is it true that you're a queer? (laughter) There's been a rumor going around the school that you're a queer. - [Student] Come on admit it. - Yes its true. (cheers) Alright, now you know, get on with the work. (students talking) - And when you don't come to school do you dress up in lady's clothes (mumbles) (laughter) - No I don't. No. - So do you get on the kings' roads? So you queerfest "come on Charlie (mumbles)" (laughter) - I haven't been down to King's road for a long time, have you? - No. Well I have actually yeah. (students talking) - (mumbles) fashion. - Yeah. - And (mumbles) you queerbite. - Mr. I thought you were going out with that Mrs. Richards. - Sorry? - I thought you were going out with Mrs. Richards, the supply teacher. - You thought I was going out with her? - Yes. - What made you presume that? - Well you always go out with her. - He's a queer teacher, I'll be (mumbles) - (mumbles) - Yeah. - The rainbow? Yes I've been there. Have you been there? - No. (students talking) - No. (students talking) Christopher, - Handbag. - I don't carry a handbag. - He carries a cucumber. (laughter) - (mumbles) ya queerbite. - Christopher. - Does your (mumbles) know you're a queer? - I have no idea. I haven't asked them. - Why (mumbles) if you know. - I don't know. - You going to answer my question sir? - What was that? - I said what do you do in bed? - Well a lot of things. (students yelling) What do you do? - I sleep usually. - Yes, well I do quite often. - No but not with other men. - Are you ashamed of it? - No, I'm not ashamed of it. - Well I mean any sort of person you meet every day isn't he? (students talking) ... everyday. - You should be buggered out shouldn't he? (students yelling) - It's not your teacher, the risk of being talked about. (students yelling) - Yeah but we all know what you know. (students yelling) - Alright, now quiet. If you want a discussion about it we'll have a discussion in a civilized fashion. One at a time. Christopher. - So what does your family think about you being queer? - There, Christopher. - So how come you can be so straight forward about it? - Cause he likes to be. (students talking) - I think it's better to be straight forward about it, don't you? - Not really. (students talking) - Christopher, do you have anything to say? Do you? - Yeah. - Probably why you are queer, (mumbles) (laughter) - I have no choice in the matter. (students talking) - Have you been with a woman? Yes I have. - You have? - Yes. What is your question? - What's your close friends and your family think about it? - My family don't know. - So why won't you tell them? - I'm not afraid of telling them, (students talking) - (mumbles) (students bickering) - Christopher the chances of me touching you are, (students bickering) - You will be a homosexual like me it's really good. - What's wrong with being gay? What's wrong? (students talking) If there's nothing wrong, (students bickering) - If everyone in the world was like him, none of us would be here would they? (students bickering) - Ricky, - What do the other teachers in the school think about you being queer? - They don't seem to mind. The question arose, and I discussed it. I answered their questions, they were asking me the usual, stupid questions that children of that age do ask because they don't know anything about the subject. They're not taught it anywhere, they certainly aren't taught it in this school. - Yes yes, but, - They were asking me questions like "Is it true you fancy little boys?" "Do you wear womens clothing?" "Do you carry a handbag?" The usual prejudices and they're going to go out and leave this school with the same things. - Yes I am sure you were acting from an (mumbles) motive. - And they'll end up probably going queer bashing. - Yes, but you must be more careful about this, Jim. This school has a little reputation, and the kind of thing you've been doing, simply inviting these people to go on and probe and probe and probe, and try and make this (mumbles) This is one of the finest comprehensive schools in the London area, and the kind of thing that you are doing is simply inviting these people to make a fuss. And we don't want that. - But it was important for those children that I talk to them about it. - Well, - They had no other chance to talk about that subject. I have been a geography teacher in this school for four years, I have never discussed sex in a classroom before. This was the first time I discussed it, and it was a good lesson and we learned a lot of it. I wish it had gone on. - Sex education is taken care of by the, - He said more or less, if you talk about homosexuality in the classroom again, you'll get the sack. - Unless of course it's in sex education classes. - Well if we're gonna go on and on about me being queer, what's the point of me trying to teach them about wheat growing in the Canadian prairies. (laughter) I mean they're not interested anyway. Half of them will be leaving next year, with what? - Well listen to your heart, if there's any trouble, we'll (mumbles) that case. Does anyone want another drink? Or have we got time? What's the time? - Half seven. - Oh yeah we've got time, no one's coming til late. Do you want another drink? - I'll have a half. - Do you want the same? - Yes please. - Yeah I'll have the same again please. - Thanks. - You tired? - Not really. - So we going to your place? It's near here. - I feel like going on somewhere else. - Somewhere else? - Yeah. - Like where? - Like a club or a disco. - It's already 1 o'clock. We've got to be up for work at 8. Thought it would be nice to be on our own for a while. - Yeah, but I don't particularly feel like going back yet. I'd like to go on somewhere else. (70's dance music) - Do you want to get a drink? - A pint of lager. - You wait here? - Yeah. (70's dance music) - There you are. - Should we have a dance? - If you want to. - Yeah, go through there. (quick dance music)
