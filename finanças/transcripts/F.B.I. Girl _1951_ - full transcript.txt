"Washington, DC." "Once, just the capital of the United States." "Today a symbol of strength." "And a bulwark of hope for the entire world."

I think this senate crime enquiry .. Is a splendid example of democracy in action. Are you not worried about the committee coming to Capitol City, Governor? Worried? Why, on the contrary, I welcome it. I think it's a healthy influence. Now it might be different if I had something to hide. What about those stories connecting you with the syndicate? Absolutely nothing to them. Vicious, ugly and unfounded rumors. Started by my unscrupulous opponents. My skirts are clean, gentlemen. If the committee hadn't decided to come to Capitol City. I would have requested this investigation. Is that good politics, Governor? It's the best politics. Look at it this way. If you wanted a clean bill of health personally, what would you do? Have a physical examination. Right? "It's the same way with the government." "The way to keep it vigorous, healthy, serving the interests of the public .." "Is to examine it periodically." "I think this senate crime investigation .." "Will prove one of the finest things to ever happen in our great state." I'm sorry, gentlemen. But that's just about all the time we'll have. We'd like to thank Governor Grisby for this inspiring democratic message. Thank you for the opportunity. - We hope to have you back again soon. Tune in next week at the same time for another meeting with the Press Panel. We're off the air. Hello, Blake. Those were lovely words, Owen. This is no time for sarcasm. We're in desperate trouble. You know that as well as I do. Take it easy, Governor. If it were just this committee, I wouldn't worry. After all, what can they do? But if I am convicted of any charge, no matter how trivial. My fingerprints automatically go to the FBI in Washington. I can see the headlines now. "Fingerprints identify Governor Grisby as John Williams." We've been able to keep your secret pretty well up to now I think. I sometimes wonder if it would have been best to have given myself up years ago. Living with a thing like this for so long, I .. If it hadn't been for you Blake, I think I would have. You're taking this far too seriously, Owen. We haven't done too badly together. But has it been worth it? What about Carl Chercourt? For all the money we're giving him, he should be able to do something. A lobbyist can only do so much. No matter how powerful he is. My influence stops at the front door of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. But I think I've found a way in, just the same. We'll be able to get your John Williams fingerprint card from the FBI files. Is that possible? No-one knows better than I how important this is. I've worked on a thing for 2 months now now just in case. I think we're ready. I wouldn't be surprised to see those prints within 24 hours. I hope so. This is getting to be almost too much for me. Why don't you look on the bright side of things, Owen? The Senate elections are coming up within a year. If you clear this investigation alright, you'll make great senatorial timber. You think so? Why not? Well, wish me luck. Yes. Yes, I wish us both luck. You know. It would be a novelty in this great country of ours, wouldn't it. A man running for the United States Senate. With a murder charge hanging over his head. Yes. Yes, Mr Blake. Well of course I understand. What? No .. no, not yet. Look, my sister is with me here now and I'm sure she'll .. Who is that, Paul? Well you .. You won't have to do anything like that, Mr Blake. No. You can depend on me. Yes. Yes, sir. What's wrong, Paul? Who were you talking to? A guy I know. Look, Sis'. I've got to ask you to do something for me. It means .. Well, it means an awful lot. More than I can say. You are in some kind of trouble. Big trouble. I'll do anything I can Paul, to help. I always have. I know, Sis'. This isn't very easy. I hate to have to ask you. If it weren't so important I'd never even .. So tell me. What is it? You've got to get me a fingerprint card out of the FBI files. A card? Oh boy. I know how you feel about the Bureau. I'm in an awful jam, but .. Donald, you're the clumsiest, you are. Now look what you've done. That's alright. Mine are in the "N"s. And yours are in the "W"s. Look, see? See, here is yours. John .. - Thanks. Yeah, but I can't find your charge-out slip. Never mind. You know what they'll do if you pull out a file without it. I know all about it. I'm just kidding, Miss Craig. Sure. If I can help you at all, I'd be very glad to. Donald, I told you never mind. Okay. Yes, Owen? It's all taken care of. You have nothing to worry about. Just a minute. Stop that, Georgia. I'm sorry, Owen. I just got word. His sister is picking up the prints tonight. Hell, I hope so. The investigators will be here in less than two weeks. You'll have that card tomorrow. And they can probe as deep as they like. What about the girl? She might talk. Don't worry. Alright, boys. "The local police were handling Natalie Craig's death as a usual hit-and-run." "But because she was a clerk in the Identification Division of the FBI." "The Bureau was notified and we were sent to investigate." Any luck? Found a couple of latent prints on her handbag. Rush them right over to Identification. And tell McAllister to give us a report. - Right. What's the story? The guy wears 11 and a half shoes. A big fellow. Must tip the scales way over 200. You got her address? - Stanley Apartments. Natalie Craig. Too bad. She was a pretty good looking dame. Yeah, and I got a date with a live one back at the hospital in half an hour. Hit that siren will you, junior. I should have listened to Marion and stuck to my criminal law practice. You should have. Yeah, only she didn't approve of some of the characters I came in contact with. So the ones you meet now are such an improvement? "Those prints on Natalie's handbag were all we had to work on." "That and a hunch this wasn't just a hit-and-run." "When we got McAllister's report on the prints, we were sure of it." These are the prints we got off the girl's handbag. And these belong to a character named George Denning. Also known as George Denton. Also, Georgia. Weight, about 240. And wears an 11 and a half shoe? A friend of yours? Just psychic. What else have you got on him? Tried once on suspicion of murder. Supposed to have carved up a girl three years ago. He beat the rap. Served time on three convictions. All as a guest of the State of Georgia. It seems he underwent psychiatric treatment in prison. Emotionally unstable, eh? The worse kind of a killer. Well, there is nothing more we can do here. Let's get over the Stanley Apartments. Cigarette? No thank you. I've got to go in. Five minutes. You forget I'm a working girl. But these might be the most important five minutes of your whole life. I may ask you to marry me again? I've already said yes. How many times do I have to keep telling you? Oh, I just like to hear you say it. [ Buzzer ] [ Buzzer ] [ Buzzer ] FBI. Oh? Sorry to bother you so late. But there are some questions we want to ask you. Well, wait just a second. Who is it? From The Bureau they said. Young? - Too tired to tell. Can I examine your identification cards again please? Thank you. Will you come in. I'm Doris Kay. Mr Stedman, Mr Donley, this is Susan Matthew. How do you do. When did you girls last see Natalie Craig? Well, not since work. But why do you want to know? Hello. This is Shirley Wayne, our other room-mate. Mr Stedman, Mr Donley. Shirley, they're here from the Department asking about Nat. This is Carl Chercourt. How do you do. - How are you? What about Natalie? Well, it is not very pleasant. She was killed tonight. Killed? How? Another car ran her off the road. I'm sorry, Shirley. Then again, it might have been deliberate. But why should anybody want to kill Natalie? That's what the FBI would like to find out. Where did she spend the evening? We had dates in town. It was Natalie's turn to use the car. What about her friends? Why, she didn't go out very much. She kept to herself most of the time. Her brother Paul was the only person I ever heard her mention. She seemed unusually upset this morning. I saw her at lunch today. She was with Paul. They both seemed terribly worried. Anything else you can tell us? I know this is none of my business, but .. Can't this hold until tomorrow? Yeah, well. Come on, Glen. Let's call it a night. Thanks very much, ladies. Goodnight. Thank you. - Goodnight. But I keep telling you .. I don't know anything. I don't know who'd want to kill her. Or why. Paul. We think somebody deliberately murdered your sister. Can't you tell us anything? But I've already told you. Tonight at the morgue is .. The first time I've seen her in .. Days. You had lunch with her today. I forgot about that. Why were the two of you so scared? We weren't. We had lunch. That's all. That's all, Paul. Thanks. You can go home now. Brand, drive Mr Craig home will you. The kid is scared. He's knows more than he's telling. That's for sure. We'll have him tailed. Owen, it was all arranged so she'd have to come through. The place .. the time .. the accident. Everything worked out. Just one thing. "The prints weren't on her." - Why did you have to kill her? I couldn't take the chance. She might have led them straight to us. "What about her brother?" We thought they'd be together. Now the FBI is watching him. I don't think he'll do much talking though for a while. He is too scared. I don't know how much more of this I can stand. A murder to cover up another. And we still don't have those fingerprints. There are some things that can't be done with a gun. Or a pay-off. Removing your fingerprints from the FBI files is one of them. You reached one girl. Can't you find another? It took me two months to set up the Craig girl. I can't perform a miracle in two weeks. - You must. Unless you do, I'm giving myself up. Gosh. I was sure sorry to hear about Natalie. So was I. And Shirley, you know what? I just remembered. Natalie pulled a card yesterday without a charge-out slip. Are you sure? I'm so sure I'm positive. Donald, come with me. Well she had this card in her hand. And when I pulled the file drawer open, I didn't see her behind me. I guess it took her by surprise. Well go ahead, Donald. You're doing fine. Well anyway, she dropped the card. And I went to help her pick it up. Not that I did it on purpose or anything. What about that card she dropped? Well, like I told Shirley. I mean, Miss Wayne. She didn't have a charge-out slip on it. When I started to get the card, I felt she would faint she was so nervous. She almost took my arm off grabbing it away from me. But I got a quick look at it. Was the name on the card George Denning? Oh, no sir. It was in the W's. Williams: John Williams. Well how about running downstairs and lifting him out of the files for us? It's going to take a long time, Mr Donley. There is nearly ten thousand John Williams's in the file. No record George Denning, also known as George Denton also Georgia. This city. Carlson, Milwaukee. Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Boston, New York. The same from every office. Nobody home. If you ask me our Georgia friend is still holed up in town. Let's throw him a coming-out party. Look mummy. It looks just like daddy. Come on. Well he does, doesn't he. "And in cooperation with the FBI and local police." "We are televising the official photographs of this man." "Taken from the files of the FBI." "If you have ever seen this man or know where he is." "Contact your local FBI or police immediately." "Hello?" This is Alex Nicholson. And I'm a bellhop at the Howard Hotel. "This George Denning you're looking for." Well there is guy living here at the hotel who could be his brother. Only his name isn't Denning. It's Douglas. There was a card party up in his room the other night. I took up some drinks. And they had a young kid in the game they called Craig. Yeah, that's it. Paul Craig. Of course I don't know. But I thought it might have something to do with that .. Natalie Craig girl that got killed. Is he still there? Yeah. Room 202. We'll be right over. Code Baker. Destination: Howard Hotel. Denning lived here alright. - We've got an ambulance on its way. Too bad he can't enjoy the ride. Check room 202 and pick up anything you can. Let's get over to Craig's apartment. Get the boys out for anyone who can identify him. The kid is probably next on the list. What's all the excitement? Denning just packed away the Night Clerk at the hotel where he lives. We figure he is out gunning for Craig. I just got him wrapped up for the night about 20 minutes ago. He's probably up there brushing his teeth right now. Well, we'll just make sure he cleans them pretty good. Stick around will you. [ Door knocks ] [ Door knocks ] Hey, Craig. Call an ambulance. "Brother of FBI girl clings to life." "Paul Craig lingers near death after knifing by unknown assailant." You stupid pig! Why didn't you make sure he was dead? I don't understand it, Mr Blake. I gave him the same treatment I have that Bellhop at the hotel. I don't understand it. You will if he lives to talk. Then I guess I maybe should do something about that. The police's fingers are around your throat so tight .. It's a wonder you don't strangle to death. Well done. Mr Blake. You know I'm a cautious soul. Why, all of Georgia didn't sleep for a whole year just looking for me. And they had bloodhounds. You've a stronger smell about you today. Well, go ahead. Yes, Father? Paul Craig's room number please. I'm sorry, but he's allowed no visitors. - Yes, I know, but I was sent for. Room 914. - Thank you. Good day to you, Reverend. A shame about that poor lad. It's rumored he won't last to see the night. But with you now about to be praying over him. Maybe there will be a miracle. It's what I'll be praying for. I'm sorry, Father. Call the fire department. We want him off that ledge alive. Sorry, Pop. We're looking for a man out there. Don't be stupid, Denning. You can't go anywhere. If you want me alive, come and get me. Yeah, we want you alive. What am I worth to you? No deals. You make me laugh. May I speak to him? Well you can try, Father. But I don't think it will help. This man. He's a Priest. No Father, he's not a real Priest. He's not even human. Whatever you have done, this is not the way. You can never justify taking your own life. Keep talking if it makes you happy. Go on, talk. No matter what you've done, don't add to it with the worst of all crimes. It's not too late. You can remake your life and atone for what has past. If we try honestly to make amends. He can still forgive. Heaven talk will get you nothing. Besides, this ain't Sunday. Won't you give me your hand? Let me help you. Another death. - Yes. Fortunately for us, he didn't live to talk. You know, you could always depend on Georgia. He died for a noble cause. Four deaths. And we're no better off than before we started. I wouldn't say that, Owen. My fingerprints are still in the FBI files in Washington. Further out of our reach than ever. And instead being wanted on one murder charge. I am now implicated in three others. They haven't got a thing on us. The only possible witnesses are dead. - That isn't the point. If I had known that it would have meant violence, I never would have consented. But Owen. It's your life we're trying to save. Not mine. - I can always resign. And do you think that would influence the crime committee? It would only confirm their suspicions. Well I .. I can get out of the country. How far do you think you'd get? Your face is too well known. I haven't been a bad governor. For twenty years I've honestly tried to do my best. But there is no other course open now. I've got to give myself up. At least then it will be off my conscience. You know you would be destroying a lot more than your own life. That's unfortunate but it can't be helped. I think it can. What are you doing? I need a set of your prints. We are going to kill John Williams. Legally. - Legally? Yes. Give me your right hand, Owen. A drunk with no name was found dead in the gutter today. We're going to substitute your prints for his. Send them to Washington for identification. The FBI will identify them as John Williams' prints. John Williams will be legally dead. The prints will be removed from the file. The file will be closed. I'm sure this is the same card that Miss Craig had. Thanks, Donald. You can go now. - Yes, sir. It doesn't add up, Don. The fingerprints match but the descriptions don't fit. These belong to bindlestiff they found dead in a rail yard up in Capitol City. Well, dead or alive. This Williams as we know him, must be a prominent man. A man with plenty of money and contacts in Washington. A man almost clever enough, according to our files and .. To kill our girl and knock off the two witnesses who could put a finger on him. Well, if that's the kind of a character we're dealing with. What's to prevent him from planting his prints on some poor stiff and .. Have us close the case for him? Say, this guy seems to be very much to be alive. And there is just one place to find out. Capitol City. "We didn't take much with us to Capitol City except hunches." "A hunch this Capitol City drunk wasn't John Williams at all." "A hunch that John Williams was still alive." "And that he was involved in the murders of Natalie and Paul Craig." "Our first stop was a broken down rooming house across the tracks." "Listed by the police as Williams' last address." Are you looking for me? If you're the landlady. - I am. The room is six dollars a week and there is no cooking. You get clean sheets every Saturday. And the bathroom is down the hall. What about your last client? - And another thing: no drinking. I've been all morning scrubbing to get the smell of the stuff out of here. I don't want no pigs living here. But you don't look like that type. Well, thanks. The man who had this room. You know anything about him? What did you say? - I said, the man who lived here. When did you last see him? If you want that room. For you? I'll let you do cooking. Would I be hanging a "For rent" sign out front if his things were still here? He took the place yesterday morning. I haven't seen him since. What happened to his things? Some jerk came along this morning and .. Said he was his brother. He cleaned all his stuff out. You know what I think? He's probably dropped dead somewhere. Dead drunk. Well, the one that came in her this morning. Did you get his name? I didn't hear him too good. The only names I remember is the ones .. on the money. Let's go, Donley. We're wasting the lady's time. Did you want the room? Well, if we change our mind, we'll be back. John Williams, huh? Wanted for murder, huh? You'd never think it to look at him. Of course if you lay in that icebox for 24 hours .. They all come out peaceful and innocent looking. Oh yeah, Williams. Here he is. Brought in day before yesterday. Found down by the railroad tracks dead drunk. It's all here in the book. Just like I said. Let's have a look at him. His brother came in to claim him. A kind of a quiet, ugly guy. Never even bothered looking at him. Just had me ship him over to Chauncey Brothers mortuary. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I'm Mr Chauncey. What can I do for you? We're checking on a man by the name of Williams. Williams? Of course, sir. John Williams. Mind if we take a look at him? Excuse me. I'll be back in just a moment. Here he is. His brother arranged for .. everything. "Donley had to check with our field office." "So I took the plane back to Washington alone." "It was quite a trick they tried to pull." "Palming off the identity and prints of a man wanted for murder on a dead man." "Then cremating the body before we could check." "It might have worked too." "Except for the coincidence of one clerk spotting one card out of millions." "Anyway, we were convinced John Williams was alive somewhere in Capitol City." "This was a day for coincidences." "Even though I didn't realize it at the time." Anyone using this seat? No. Sit down. Thank you. A lady up there is travelling with a baby. Not that I don't like children. - Yes, I know what you mean. Newspaper, sir? - Yes, thank you very much. And you, sir? - No, thank you. A funny thing, this senate investigation. Good for the country, don't you think? - Yes, I do. I heard Governor Grisby discussing it on television the other night. Did you happen to hear it? No, I'm sorry. I live in Washington. Oh. Working for the government? - Yes, just another bureaucrat. I'm from Capitol City but my work takes me to Washington occasionally. Oh, what's your line? Oh, public relations. - Ah. What do they think of Grisby down in Washington? What do you mean? Well we think he is senatorial material. As a matter of fact. There are several groups in Capitol City who are thinking of backing him. What about this investigation? Oh. Take a fine house and look hard enough. You'll find a little dirt under the rug. But as far as Grisby is concerned, why .. "A nice fellow I thought as I listened to him." "We even made plans to get together for a drink sometime at The Mayflower." "If I'd only known." "We were going to get together alright but not for a drink." "And the lining of the coat matches the lining of the pocket." "And the lining of the hat matches the lining of the shoes." "And the handkerchief matches the shirt for sure." "So the cuff-links match the ring, the lining of the sleeve matches the shirt." "And now ladies and .." Do you give all your time to the FBI, Mr Stedman? Are you sure you don't know what time Shirley will be home? Does it really matter that much? "I don't even know why I talk to you." "What are you talking about now? All of a sudden you've got such a big head." "Backstage I asked you a very important question and you walked right past me." "I didn't say hello to you backstage?" - "That's right." "I'll tell you the excuse." - "What is it?" "You know the reason?" "Since our flight from Buffalo, Tom, my ears have been plugged up." "I've had thee periodic spells of deafness. I can't hear a thing." "Pete, why didn't you tell me?" "The same thing happens to me." - "You're joshing?" "Every time I get in an aeroplane my ears plug up. I can't hear a thing." "What do you do for it, Tom?" "Well I tell you Pete, on a trip from Cincinnati." "I picked up these medically treated pieces of cotton, see." "Now you take these pieces of cotton, put them in your ears." "You can hear anything anybody says." - "Huh?" "I said with the cotton in your ears you can hear anything anybody said." "Can you speak up Tommy. The airplane ride from .." "I said, with the cotton in your ears! Just a second, I'll show you." "I said with the cotton in your ears you can hear anything anybody said." "Huh?" "I said where did you get the cotton?" - "Your lips move. Are you talking?" "Certainly I'm talking. I said .." "I said where did you get the cotton? They're great." "I got them in Cincinnati." - "Huh?" "I picked them up in Cincinnati." - "What was that, Tom?" "I bought them in Cincinnati! I'll give them back to you." "I bought them in Cincinnati." - "No kidding. How much did they cost?" "Huh?" "I said how much are the ear plugs." - "You're not coming in, you know." "I said .." "Could you raise it an octave higher?" - "How much did they cost?" "You've got them in, Tom." "Ten dollars a pair." - "Was it that?" "Fix this." "Ten dollars a pair." - "Do they come in colors?" "Any color you like." - "Peppermint coated?" "Like to dance?" - "I'd love to dance." Well, hello. Boy, am I glad to see you. I want to talk to you, Shirley. Alone. It's important. Official. We can take a hint. Well, excuse us a minute will you, girls. Very funny guys. Yeah. Very funny. Dopes. I thought the "B" in FBI stood for bravery. Well it did until your room-mates tried to make a test case out of it. I have a date this evening. I'm being picked up in about an hour. Do you mind if I change? - Not at all. Go right ahead. Thank you. What is it you wanted to see me about? Well. You're not going to like it. How do you know until you ask me? Shirley. We've hit an impasse on the Craig case. The card that Natalie pulled on John Williams turned up again. This time there is an inquiry from the Capitol City police. Asking us to identify a dead man. What threw us was that the prints match those of William that we have on file. We followed the lead back to Capitol City. And all we got for our troubles was a handful of ashes and a couple of angles. A hunch that John Williams is still alive. And that the one who may know his real identity is .. Carl Chercourt. - Carl? Do you mean to tell me that .. He had something to do with Natalie's death? Now, we don't know that yet. But we know that John Williams, whoever he is, is a big man in Capitol City. And Carl is the number one lobbyist for all the big interests in Capitol City. He's been trying for weeks to kill a senate crime committee hearing .. Into the political machine that runs that State. You'll never convince me that Carl had anything to do with murder. Now Shirley, this is important. He may know who Williams is. Well, why don't you ask him? What, and blow the case if he is involved? I was hoping you'd be our inside angle. Let me get this straight. Are you telling me that you're going to use me to get information out of Carl? I told you you wouldn't like it. Goodnight, Mr Stedman. Here is your hat. And you might look up the meaning of another word in your FBI motto. "Fidelity". What's the matter, darling? Carl .. those people you lobby for. You never talk about them. Who are they? Business people. Politicians with their hands out looking for favors. But what are they like? - I don't know. I never stopped to figure it out. With me, it's strictly a job. You know, it's cold reality that operates my world, Shirley. Money. I made up my mind on that a long time ago. I made up my mind when I saw my father die from a stroke. In the middle of a speech on the senate floor. He'd spend his whole life fighting for causes. He died broke. But not me. Not when I can use the contacts I have .. And make more money in a year than he made in his whole lifetime. Why all the .. the sudden questions? Carl, I've been hearing rumors inside the Bureau. Never take a rumor in Washington seriously. If they ever stopped nobody would have anything to talk about. This is different. It's about you and the people you lobby for. The people I lobby for is my own business. I'm registered with the government. Why should it bother the FBI? Well it does. The Bureau think somebody in your group killed Natalie. When she didn't turn over a fingerprint file on a man wanted for murder .. The same file turned up later and was identified as belonging to a dead man. Well, the FBI thinks that man is alive. And through your connections .. You might know who he is. That's ridiculous. My job is politics, not murder. That's why I'm telling you, Carl. Those fingerprints. What did you say the name of the man was? I didn't. But it's John Williams. John Williams. Never heard of him. It must be important you calling me up here at this hour of the night. What's the big mystery you couldn't talk about over the phone? John Williams. Who's he? I thought you might be able to tell me, Blake. Since we're all brothers under the skin. He's one of us. Did you pull me out of bed and drag me clear across the Potomac .. Just to play a name quiz? The FBI wants him for murder. Does that mean anything to you? It might impress me. What else do you know about him? That he's supposed to be dead. Then what's the problem? The FBI doesn't think he is. Who is he, Blake? Where did you dig all this up? Straight from the FBI. The girl I'm engaged to happens to work for the Bureau. Really? How convenient. What division? Fingerprint identification. Carl. For a young fellow you've come a long way. You've managed to get all the good things out of life. Lucky girl. I only hope she can enjoy them. What are you driving at? We have a slight problem on our hands. There's a rope around our necks. Big enough to fit all of us. But I think now it can be removed without too much difficulty. This .. girl you're engaged to. It should be simple for her to extract a certain set of prints from those files. Like Natalie Craig? Uhuh. You've picked the wrong girl this time, Blake. No. No, I haven't. Well. Here is to your future happiness. Anything else? - No. That's all, thanks. Shirley. Something has happened. It's about what you told me last night. Today it has a different meaning. Yes, Carl? I want you to listen to me very carefully. And try hard to understand. Suppose. Suppose Williams was a really important man. Who got off to the wrong start. And no matter how hard he tried, couldn't make up for it. And now his past is about ready to explode. And unless something is done about it. Several innocent lives may be destroyed. Why don't you say it, Carl? You want me to get John Williams' fingerprints out of the file. That's what you're trying to say, isn't it? Last night you said you had nothing to do with him. You didn't even know him. Now today you're asking me to .. Betray a trust for a murderer. It's not for him, Shirley. It's for us. For everything I've battled for. For all the things I want for you. And you want me to help buy it? I can't explain it Shirley, but .. But do it. Do it for me. I'll be late for work, Carl. Can we leave? That jerk. I asked him in to say goodnight and all of a sudden I've a struggle on my hands. All he wanted to do was to show me how they take fingerprints, he said. So I gave him my fingers. All five of them, right in his face. So what did he do? He almost broke my arm, the idiot. Come on in. Have a chair. I'm sorry about what I said last night. I am the one who should have understood the meaning of fidelity. Did you tell Chercourt? Yes. I knew you would. You knew? - Sure. That's exactly what he wanted you to do. But I .. - Now what about Carl? Well today, since the first time I've known him. He was waiting outside my apartment to drive me to work. I knew why he was there and I .. Suddenly got all twisted up inside. He wants you to pull the fingerprint card on John Williams? What were his reasons? His career. Everything he's worked for. Our life together. Well, pretty convincing reasons. And what do you think of them, Shirley? I'm all mixed up. I love him but if he's tied in with the wrong things I've got to know. You said Carl was your last angle. Yes. You might get hurt. Yes, I know. What can I say, Shirley. There is nothing to say. I did what you wanted. And what about us? Carl. I was the one who always thought money could buy anything. Causes, people. Anything. Now it is ironic. The one time I couldn't buy my way out. I had to come to you. You'll never know how sorry I am. I said I'd bring the prints to you, Blake. I thought I'd save you a trip. I followed her here. Just for insurance. Is this a good enough premium? Why, that depends. Now stay away from us, Blake. And that depends. I think I'd better go now. We've both got a lot to think about. Convinced those are not my prints, Blake? I'm convinced. You think Carl helped her? No, I don't think so. He is much too involved. What about the FBI? If they knew who John Williams was .. You wouldn't be here, Owen. And just to protect your luck. There is a quiet little church down the road. Drop in and make an offering. A large one. And a prayer might help. But will the FBI hear it? I'm sure they will. All set. We had a camera crew staked out across from Chercourt's apartment. We knew that once you gave him the prints .. He'd deliver them personally or turn them over to a contact. He never left his place but he certainly had lots of callers. While you were in the apartment we saw this man enter. He sat next to me on the plane from Capitol City. He claimed to be a public relations man. Do you know who he is, Shirley? I was on the balcony. I heard voices but I couldn't hear what they were saying. We had him followed to the airport where he took a plane to Capitol City. We are still waiting for a report. About half an hour after you left this kid showed up. He only stayed a few minutes. Turned out to be Sonny Pardoe. He works for the biggest bookie in town. Yeah. Chercourt must have had a bad day. Who is she? She is a stenographer. A very efficient one too. Does 120 words a minute shorthand, and rattles off 90 a minute on a typewriter. Like to see the report? This intriguing character turned out to be "Handsome Harry" an ex-wrestler. He now makes with massages instead of faces. While Chercourt was having a rub down, Steven Merrow, the .. Real estate king from Capitol City paid him a visit. [ Telephone ] Give it, Rand. Donley. Yeah. Yeah. Uhuh. Okay, thanks. That was Palmer from Capitol City. He trailed Chercourt's friend to the Mannering Hotel. That's where he lost him. Just his luck the hotel was overcrowded with three conventions. He said the place was a madhouse. We're right back where we started. I'm sorry I couldn't be more help. That's alright, Shirley. Keep in touch with us. I will. I think the pressure is beginning to show on our girl. Well, she's in a pretty rough spot. Doing a man's job for us .. Carrying a torch for Chercourt. Miss Wayne? - Yes. What do you want? I'm a close friend of Carl Chercourt. I'd like to talk to you. In private. Why did you switch those prints? Miss Wayne, about those fingerprints. I couldn't go through with it. I thought any set would get by so I used my own. I'm only going to say this once Miss Wayne, so I want you to remember it. I want the real fingerprint file on John Williams. Hello Benson? Glen Stedman. Say, how long would it take you to forge a set of prints for me? What about file cards? Good. I'll send the card right over. Oh and .. Age it down a bit will you. This little dream operates on the same principle as a walkie-talkie. Built-in batteries. Extra sensitive microphone. This switch when you want to go on the air. Turn it on a minute will you, Glen. The range is a little bit less than a mile. But all our cars are tuned to the same wavelength. Same as this. You try it. What will I say? Just don't run out of words when the right time comes. See if you can turn it off okay. Shouldn't have any trouble. Can't tell it from the original. We gave it the complete treatment. Dust and all. A fine job, Gibson. Then what? I'm to have Carl pick me up. I'm to give them to him. It's not too late to back out. I've still got things to find out. You make your call to Chercourt. Relax Shirley. Yes, Miss Wayne. Relax. - Blake. Just watch the road. We don't want any accidents. Keep going straight ahead. I'll take that fingerprint card now, Miss Wayne. "Let's have the prints." "Thanks." Donley. Keep a clear channel. Wayne with Chercourt. License number "D". 9-6-6-9. "Headed over the 14th Street bridge." "Speed 35 miles an hour." "Put Operation One into effect as planned." "They are coming out of the bridge now. It could be any place from here." Don't get lost. Harris, you and Lockwood reach this point. You have to hit 55 and 60 all the way. - Right, sir. You and Barnes get to this spot and stake yourselves out .. Until you pick up further word from Donley and Stedman. All police have been alerted. You won't be stopped. Is it asking too much to tell us where we're going? Not at all. I'm having a little celebration at my house tonight. You two are the guests of honor. - How nice. Then we'll get to meet Mr Williams. It's a surprise party, Miss Wayne. "You wouldn't want me to spoil all the fun, would you?" If we hit open country we'll have to drop back and we'll lose contact. Get the flash to Whitey. Donley again. They are on the Virginia side. Heading towards the Lincoln Highway. Over. Stay with him. Operation One under way. Slow down for a minute. Now, keep driving at the same speed. Do you always have your car following, Mr Blake? Your eyes are as good as your memory, Miss Wayne. Company. Yeah, the wrong kind. I never figured you to pull a double-cross, Blake. I said it all depends. They are fading fast. I don't like it, Glen. If we pace him he'll see us, and if we pull back we'll lose him. We'll have to sweat it out. What about the girl? - What about her? Well, go ahead and say it. There are times to forget the case and think of the people involved. It's nice work if you can do it. Once you start to compromise personal feelings, it's time to quit this job. Donley, to all cars .. all cars. The target has picked up a seeing eye. We have to pull back. Request Operation Two at once. Do you get me, Whitey? Over and out. All cars. Verify positions. Barnes at Point A proceeding as planned. Lockwood. Cruising assigned route. On schedule. Hold positions. Keep channel open for Operation Two. Over and out. "Yes, sir?" Scott. Washington airport. "Turn left at the next road marker, Chercourt." "Doesn't that take us along the river?" Scott. Operation Two from helicopter. "Picked up range on target Two. Moving in to follow." "It turned off Lincoln Highway. Destination some place along the river." "All cars covered. Scott out." There is a narrow dirt road half a mile just beyond that clump of trees. Turn in to it. "Scott. Over target now." "Leave highway and hit river." "About three miles up and follow my tail light." "I'll be hanging right over them. Scott out." "Scott to all cars." "Do you see me? Over." Lockwood. Check. We're right with you. Barnes. Check. Position minus two miles. Donley. Check. Hello Carl. Governor Grisby. I'm sorry you had to be dragged into this. It was the only way. Here is your miracle, Governor. It will take more than a miracle to get you out of this, Governor. I've waited a long time. Carl. There will always be a place for you with us. I have two more years in office. Next, it might even be the White House. You haven't a chance. Not with men like Blake in your organisation. You've just burned up your past. But you're not blowing up my future. "Chercourt is not setting the fuse." "We're doing this my way." "Scott to all cars." "Target to my left." "Right on river." "Check me if you're in range." We're in range. Keep your tail light burning. We're homing on it. Donley out. Barnes to Scott. Give us ten minutes and we'll be under your landing gear. Barnes out. Lockwood. Your light is in our window. [ Bang! ] Lockwood to all cars. We're out of the running. We blew a tire. Over and out. Governor Grisby. Did you ever stop to think there might be copies of your fingerprint records? Or that I may have had them photographed? Where are they? I mailed copies to my room-mates. With a note saying if I wasn't back within 24 hours .. They were to notify the FBI. I don't think you did, Miss Wayne. I don't think you had time to mail anything to anybody. If she did have duplicates made, they are in here. So, they've heard everything we've said. "That's very interest?ng." "I hope they are still listening." I'm walking out of here and Miss Wayne goes with me. Whether she lives or not is up to you. We've not much time. You go ahead, Blake. I'm tired. Tired of running. "Both targets appear to be broadcasting." "I'll hang it up over the area. Check me when you enter. Scott, out." Cops! Get her up, Fred. Almost made the Honor Plaque ton?ght. You still have to make it the hard way. - Yeah, looks like it. * Steve D *
