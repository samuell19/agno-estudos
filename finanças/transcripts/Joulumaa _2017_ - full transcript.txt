Honey, buenos días. - Mom, they speak Portuguese here. And I have to go. Who's that? - Nobody. You have a man there, Sofia? You're not in love, are you? Seriously, Mom. Are you drunk? Well, I had one glass of wine. A glass of Syrah. Being able to name the grape doesn't make you any less of a drunk. I should really go. You sure you're okay?- I am. The first Christmas alone might be difficult. And I'm here faraway - Honey, I'm okay. I'll write in my diary, - light a few candles, listen to Joni Mitchell. Mom, that sounds really bad. Under no circumstances, no Joni Mitchell. I'll listen to whoever I want. WONDERLAND Don't. I don't want you to hurt yourself. Hey, thanks a lot. - That's okay. I could've taken the tires to the summerhouse... The tires have always been stored here for the winter. How's the shower drain? - Pretty slow. I could take a look at it after Christmas. - Great. Don't touch it before I come. - I won't. We don't want any accidents, do we? - No. You want to come in for a glass of Riesling? I think I have to go. Elisa wants to go to some damn flower... Oh, of course. Yep. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Say hi to Elisa. - Yeah. People still want to spend Christmas with family. Some people spend it with a large group of relatives. They'll invite grandparents and cousins. But today it might be more common to celebrate Christmas - with just immediate family. In any case, people want to be with their loved ones. Fuck! I think this Christmas is too much for me. I don't even have anyone to buy presents for. Sofia just wants money. I thought... ...that by Christmas... ...he would've left her and come back to me. Elisa is, like. 35. What do they even talk about? If I had any money, I'd take a last-minute flight somewhere. I have to get away. Malva, what are you doing? It's polite to answer when someone asks you a question. Good morning, girls! - Malva drew on the wall again. Malva honey, why did you do that? That won't come off. Did you want to express yourself? - Maybe. It's an amazing drawing. Your strokes are very intense. But next time ask for paper. okay? Yeah. Come here, hummingbird. Put your coat on. and we'll go outside. - Okay. What is she trying to say with the drawing? - That she's the Antichrist? Yeah. A child her age always has a reason for that. Becoming more independent might be causing her pain. When are they coming? "An old-fashioned Christmas away from material things." "Come spend Christmas at our organic farm!" "Find the Christmas spirit within yourself." Where did you find this? - I googled "cheap Christmas getaways." Their ad sounds like a sappy country song. - Country is good. Mom. wake up! - I'm awake. All you ever do is sleep. I know you're upset that I don't do what you want me to do, - but you still can't throw them. - Yes, I can! Malva, calm down. - Dad's better at playing this. He never falls asleep! - Because he sleeps at night! Go away! You're stupid! I ruined your plans. - I forgive you. I'll celebrate my traditional Christmas a week late. You'll drink and overeat alone. Silent night... Why aren't you singing? Goddammit. Forget that idiot. He's not coming back. All right. Welcome. - Thank you. Hi, I'm Tuure. Helena. - Ulli. This is my daughter Malva. - Hi, Malva. Welcome Helena and Ulli to our bed and breakfast. I'm so happy you had room, even though we booked so late. There you are. This is my wife Unna. Hi. Welcome. - Hi. Ulli. Nice to meet you. Your house is lovely. Did you inherit it? - No... Here you are. Here's your room. - Very nice. We'll eat in 30 minutes. This soup is delicious. And so light. It's vegan and made from our own carrots. Have you studied farming? - You can find info online. I learned to shear sheep from a YouTube video. - You have sheep? Yeah. But I'm actually a sociologist, - and Unna will graduate from architecture school. - We'll see... I always wanted to be an architect. - You're a teacher, right? No, I work in administration at the university. I studied art history, - but my husband got transferred abroad - and then my daughter was born and... We also had to make sacrifices when we chose this lifestyle. But knowing why we want to do this gives us energy. Why do you want to do this? This planet can't take this anymore. - People consume too much. That's why we eat additive-free food and farm organically. We consume as little as possible. - We want to be self-sufficient. Yeah, even though it's a bit... Yeah, we're still working on it. I mean, farming is damn difficult. It came as a surprise. We didn't know much about it when we started. Ideology first, right? Yeah. I'm going to start baking bread. I got a great mother dough from our neighbor. You want to come see me bake? Hi, Harri's answering machine. I just called because something came to my mind... I just saw beautiful scenery... Merry Christmas! Hello. - Hello. I promised Tuure I'd take a look at his tractor. He said he has trouble starting it. All right. You two have already met. So, all the guests are here. I'm glad we have a strong, handy man here. Otherwise the tractor would never be fixed. Can you fix it? - Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Who did you call? - That's none of your business. I called my neighbor. - The old guy? C'mon. The voltage regulator might burn out - if you don't have the battery hooked in for a moment. It's annoying, but fixable. - Damn, is that so? Yeah. - We've known each other two hours, and I already love you. Oh, come on. - How come you know tractors so well? You had a farm? - No. This is just a hobby. If you like fixing things, you're in the right place. - Totally. Malva, are you nervous about Christmas? - No. I am because I don't know if Santa will come. And if there'll be enough Christmas ham. We didn't want to lie to Malva about Santa Claus. So there will be no Santa Claus. And there will be no Christmas ham either because we're vegans. I made a vegetarian Christmas ham. Of Quorn and seitan. The recipe said it tastes just like ham. I can make a couple of calls and find out - if one of the local farmers can sell us a ham. - Good idea. You have to have a ham at Christmas. - That's right. On the other hand, it's terrible how the pigs suffer. Tuure and I really don't have time to go get it... Ulli and I can go get it. - I can get it. You two can go. problem solved. - That's it. What brought you to Christmas Wonderland? We call their farm Christmas Wonderland because their ad says, - "Find the Christmas spirit within yourself." I mean, we call it that jokingly. I came to Christmas Wonderland... Well... I always want to do something different at Christmas, go somewhere. I don't really have any Christmas traditions. I saw an ad in the paper and booked a room. Otherwise I'd be home alone. I made this casserole with our organic rutabagas. One of the few times we managed to grow something. Our potato crops were shitty because we got some beetles in it. But that's what a farmer's life is like sometimes. Have you been a bed and breakfast a long time? - No. Actually... You're our first guests. We had to come up with something - because the farming didn't take off so well. Yeah. It should be somewhere near here. You have to get behind the wheel. I'll push. I don't know how to do that. I haven't driven in 30 years. Anything that requires coordination... I can't do anything simultaneously with my hands and feet. Nonsense. Once we find a ham, you'll drive us back. Oh yes. Have you known Helena a long time? - Yes, almost thirty years. I met her through her ex-husband. I'm also their daughter's godmother. Do you have children? - No. But I still have time, right? Aren't there a lot of young families here? Most of them live in the village. We're here on the outskirts. We haven't gotten to know many locals. Tuure knows some farmers, though. Tuure seems to make new friends fast. - Yeah, everybody loves him. And I'm his unapproachable wife. You're doing good. Just keep the wheel straight. - Quiet. I'm a genius! Shit. Goddammit. Let's tell them you drove. - Me? You made me. It's your fault. - I'd consider saying I drove. If you hadn't loved every minute of it. - I did not. I can give you additional driving lessons if you ask me nicely. It must be mind-blowing to find out at your age - that you can do things with your hands and feet at the same time. Hi. I was thinking. Would you and Tuure like to take a nap? I can babysit Malva. - No, thanks. Well. How about just a walk? Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! We don't regret coming here. do we? - Of course not. We hate material things, don't we? I'm turning fifty next year. I don't feel fifty. - Nobody does. Getting old is terrible. No matter what some celebrity in an interview says. Nobody should have to get older than 48. - Why 48? That's just how it is. All right. Once again I've done all the work while you just watched and drank. "Once again"? Your daughter is so sweet. You also have kids, right? - I have a daughter, Sofia. I wanted another child, but it didn't work out. Have you thought about a sister or brother for Malva? If I may ask. - Definitely not. We have our hands full just with her. Try to enjoy the time when she's small. It's the best time of your life. Really? All older women say that, but I don't know how that's possible. It's a terrible thought. Things have to get better than this. I'm sure it depends on the person. I was at home with my daughter and enjoyed it very much. You didn't miss anything? Something of your own? Something more of my own than my own child? Wasn't your generation's favorite song called - "Your Children Are Not Your Children"? The people who liked that song were twenty years older than me. Oops. - Besides, it's not true what the song says. Our children are ours. - Is the sacrifice still worth it? I don't feel I sacrificed anything. You did sacrifice a university degree, - career and a dream job. It might feel like a sacrifice to you - because you wouldn't have made the same choices. Well, I've thought about this a lot. I don't think older women remember what it was like at this age. Hey. Malva, turn the lights back on. Malva, could you please turn the lights back on. Malva, turn the lights back on, or you'll get no Christmas presents. Hummingbird, Mom would be really happy if you turned the lights on. On the other hand, this mood lighting is pretty nice. Malva, you should turn the lights on - because Uncle Oiva would like to say a few words. Thank you, Malva. Thank you, Helena. I'm going to say a couple of things. I'd like to thank our host and hostess - for giving us this wonderful Christmas. Well, you're paying for it. Well, thank you for picking us as your guests. You're the only ones who wanted to come. That's how popular we are. Maybe we were the only ones who didn't have anything to do. So that's how popular we are. You can move in here. I'll break things and you fix them. Let's not exaggerate. If I may give you advice as an older person, - I'd say, don't be too hard on yourselves. Try to be on the same side with one another. And so without further ado, Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Meat eaters may also have this. - Thank you. Looks like death. - Interesting, because no one died for that. What's that? - It's pig meat. Real pig meat? - Yes. Oiva and Helena got a pig from a local farmer. Secretly? - No. The farmer gave it to them. That's weird. - Yeah, it is a little weird. Malva doesn't want to eat ham because she's never tasted it. It's delicious. - Malva, you can taste it. You can decide whether you want to be a vegan or not. I'm a vegan. - Good. That's the new generation. - Of hippies. Exactly. - I'll taste your vegan stuff. I made calculations about the ham. With rationing, it'll last until the end of our stay. But only for two people. So. are you ready to sacrifice Ulli? Ulli is a tough woman. She'll survive a couple of days on wine, if necessary. You have to taste this. Ulli, more wine? - Thanks, I'd love another glass. Actually I'd like to say a few words too. Somehow amidst all this. - what Oiva said helped me remember what's important. It's not New Year's yet, but can I make a wish? Go ahead. - Why not. We haven't talked to anyone about this, - but I hope our long-time dream comes true - and we have another child. Let's toast to that. Good luck for the project! Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers. I always wanted freedom. I don't have kids, - and I no longer want a traditional relationship. But I'm dating. - Did she fall asleep? I'm seeing a couple of men. - What are you talking about? Ulli is telling us stories about her horrible life. Stop. - I was just joking. Ha ha. - I didn't mean to hurt you. You invaded my personal space. - C'mon. I tried to kiss you. I'm going to bed. - Oh. We should also go to bed. - Yeah. Why don't we clean up. - Well... Sure. This is a basic thing. The bishop always moves diagonally. I warned you. You'll lose your patience with me. - I won't. But we have to come up with a compensation system. I'm teaching you chess. and earlier I gave you driving lessons. I just want to make sure of one thing. You have a husband, right? Yes and no. - Okay. It's too bad you do. And interesting that you don't. My husband Harri left me a little less than a year ago, - but he's coming back. So I don't want to make things any more complicated. I guess then we just have to concentrate - on the world of chess. Oh. I think I have to go to bed. I'm tired. Hi. Peculiar taste in music for someone her age. - Yeah. I think I'll get going... Hi. Yeah... I've been thinking about you having and not having a husband. If by any chance today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow - you have a moment when you don't have a husband, - could you please let me know? Hi. - Hi. Jesus, that girl's taste in music. Great! You're lighting a fire. - Yeah. Should we eat something? - I think I'm heading to bed. It's 8 o'clock. - Yeah, I'm tired. Aren't you going to eat anything? - I'm not hungry. You're always hungry. - No, I'm not. Good night. - God night. Good night. - God night. Take your clothes off. If you don't let me under the blanket right now,- I'll go sleep in the family bed next door. You'll be ovulating around Christmas, right? Yeah, something like that. We've been trying a long time. It would help if you knew your cycle better. Yeah, sorry. Should we try? So we don't miss a month. I guess we have to. Can we do this really quick? I have to wake up in five hours with her. - Yeah. Are you watching me sleep? No. - I think you were. Did you sleep at all? Yes. - No, you didn't. You were just staring at me. Lying in bed like this is not very smart. - No, but it's nice. Just don't fall in love with me, and there'll be no trouble. If someone falls in love, it'll be you. I don't think so. I prefer uglier women. Shut up. Let's not get into stuff like that now. This was just a one-time thing. - Yeah. I'm here! Mom, why is the door locked? I have a right to go to the bathroom alone! Malva, stop! - Why? Because the handle will break if you hang onto it. Open the door! You're gonna make Mom feel bad. Open! Open! Open! I'll break the door if you don't open it! Open! Open! Open! Shit! Stop, you're crazy. Oh honey. I'm sorry, honey. Are you okay? You're the best girl in the world. Could you pour me a little coffee. There you go. - Thanks. I think tonight will be a girls' night out. There's dancing at the local bar. Can't we stay here? It's so cozy here. No, we're going out. Unna needs to get out too. Don't stress out. I'm so happy you're doing that. - Yeah, I'm finally doing this. We're leaving, but I don't think I'll be late. We'll be fine. But take it easy. With alcohol. I mean, I'm sure it's not good for your ovaries - if you get totally wasted. But I'm happy you finally get to go somewhere. I just thought that now that you're ovulating... Yeah. Well, bye! - Bye! Have fun! You want a sip? What if I don't go? You have to. - No. You're having a girls' night out. I'll wait for you in my room. Drink coffee. That's great. Finally you're thinking about what's best for you. I think this is actually the best time of your life. You can't be serious. - I am. You just have to let go of things. By "things," I mean Harri. Nothing will last if you give up after the first conflict. It's no longer a conflict when he's living with another woman. I think the sex god is competing with your perfect husband. Who's the sex god? - Oiva. Well, damn. You're both a mess. Doesn't this struggle ever end? - No. Well, how long have you been trying for a baby? If I may ask. A long time. Or. I mean, something like a year and a half. It feels longer. The first six months was fun, but now I just hate sex. Although Unna seems to hate it even more. What about Helena? - What about her? She's taken. By her ex-husband. - Classic. Unna found peer support. Are those people locals? They don't look like country folk. They could be industrial designers who are downshifting here. Unna, what the hell? - You've been in this bar all these years? Eating chili nuts and drinking coolers. - Throwing darts. I designed the interior too. - In classic small-town style. The three of us just started our own company. One of our projects was accepted into a pretty big competition. Wow. Congratulations. You have a summerhouse here? - And where do you work? You don't work in Helsinki, do you? Wow. - That's a bold move. I'm surprised, but that's great. We have a small organic farm. We have some sheep, but our focus is on other products. That's great. Ivana and I only buy organic meat. - Totally. Good for you. Can we find your products at our local organic store? Well, no. We're still working on it. Do you have children? - No, we don't. No. - Not yet. I do. Terrible, I forgot about my child. What? - Yeah, her name is Malva. Here. - Oh, she's cute. How old is she? - And a sheep in the photo. Five. - Five? I have to say my values completely changed after she was born. I can imagine. - I guess that's what always happens. Yeah, that's what happens. - And it's a good thing. It's hard to understand unless it happens to you. Hey, let's do shots. They're on me. I can't. I'll turn into an animal. - True. We're interested in hearing about your idea. That would be great. I'm interested in green building. - Right. I'm building an addition to our house. You have other green building ideas? To us. You young people are so conservative. You're in relationships and have huge mortgages. That's what I admire about her generation. I wish I was old already too. What if I just ditched the rat race? When will I have time to have a baby? You've managed to do everything. There's never a right time to have a baby. Hey, we didn't finish our game. I have an idea! Let's go to my house for an after-party! But you have a child. - And Oiva and Tuure. They're sleeping. - A farmhouse after-party! You have cows? - You have booze? Helena and Ulli emptied a couple of liquor stores on their way. Middle-aged people have the best wine. - True. Hey. I'm going to Ville's house for an after-party. - You go, girl! Really? - Yeah. Why not? Have fun! All right, 10 kilometers that way. Oh shit. Oh dear. - Get up, okay? Get on my back. - No. Oh dear. This will be the end of us. You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly like you were before. Is this really smart? If someone asks you if you're a feminist, you'll say yes, right? It depends on the situation. Don't you have a man waiting for you at home? - Yeah. But you don't have to worry about him. He's asleep. He's not the partying type. Unlike me. I'd love to fuck you. We can fuck. Less than thirty minutes, and you'll be inside me. Wait. One second. Helena! Oh no. Oh, Unna. Does this mean the after-party is canceled? We walked half an hour to get here. I'm okay. I just need a breath mint. Anybody have a mint? You're putting country folk's hospitality to the test. Unna, maybe it's better if we head home. - No! I hope you find your way. - Yeah. It was nice to see you. Unna, we'll be in touch. Can you get up? Lean on me. Why did you want to come here? I don't know. I guess we just wanted to destroy something. We chose Christmas. I think we should go. Shit. I always trip over these shoes. You have to drink water. - Okay. Hi. - Oh. Who's that? - We have a surprise guest. Merry Christmas. What the f... Did something happen to Sofia? - No, she's okay. Can we go talk somewhere? We can go... ...to my room. You want to hear how it went with Malva? No. All right. When did it happen? - A week ago. But it's been like that for quite some time. Say something. Where do you want to go? Should we book a cruise to Sweden for New Year's Eve? Yeah. it's a great idea to start with the cheapest option. That's all I can afford. - I have money. We can travel to Vienna, for example. Hey, smile. Okay, let's go to Vienna then. - Yeah. I sent a message to Sofia. The photo? What did you write in it? "Hi from Mom and Dad." A couple of jokes. "Let's call." We could've talked about sending a message. Sofia is pretty sensitive. - Is she? I think parents just like to think their children are very sensitive. Good morning. - Good morning. That was a good night's sleep. It's the fresh country air. Malva is outside. I made breakfast for her. I didn't want to wake up Unna and Tuure. - Okay. He's unsociable. He hardly said a word to me yesterday. I see. - Good morning, Ulli. Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. You've been partying. You look energetic. - Love gives me energy. Some say love dries you up inside and finally kills you. There are different schools of thought. Harri and Elisa broke up. Oh, Harri. Try to make up your mind. Good morning. - Good morning. I can't remember the last time I slept this late. My body is in shock. Where's Malva and Unna? - Malva's outside with Oiva. Isn't Unna in bed? She was okay at the bar? Did she say anything special? Maybe she was a bit quiet at first. But she cheered up, didn't she? Yeah. I mean, we met people she went to school with at the bar. They were really nice. Later something happened... ...with one of them. - What happened? With whom? There was this guy named Henri. He and Unna... Something happened between them. What do you mean, "something"? A little kiss. Maybe you should just ask Henri. Right. You know where they're staying? - At a big house by the lake. Henri was his name? - Yeah. And Ivana and Asser. - Holy fuck, what names. Could someone go to the bus station and ask if Unna's been seen there? And can someone babysit Malva? - I can babysit Malva. You want to drive? You started driving again? - In a way. Is it safe for me to get in the car with you behind the wheel? That's what I've been trying to tell you. - Phew. Hi. Hi. I'm looking for Henri. Or Unna. Henri! She was really drunk. I should've helped her more. She has insomnia. We'll find her. Why should she sleep? She's got better things to do. Harri, c'mon. - I think it's weird you're so empathic. She cheated on her husband and disappeared. - Oh. I thought you of all people could relate to that kind of behavior. You don't know where she went? No. I told her she could sleep on the couch, - but she probably felt... I had sobered up. It didn't seem like such a good idea anymore. Could you let me know when you find her? - Yeah, right. Why did you have to tell complete strangers about my life? I don't fucking believe this. It's not only your life. What the fuck. You can't just come and go as you please. Take your summer tires somewhere else! To Elisa's house! I don't deserve this shit. - Right. I'm stupid because I waited for you. - No, you're not. I didn't have any... I haven't thought about anything. Maybe it was an age crisis. Last year... sucked. Everything was a lie. I'm sorry. Can't we just go home? I can't leave before we find Unna. Er... I have to go to the office tomorrow. Won't they be okay without you? I've waited almost a year for you. You can wait a couple of days for me. Yes, Malva really liked the present. By the way, have you heard from Unna? Oh? Where? "The troll sat on a tree stump and sighed." "'I'll never go in the dark forest alone again - without asking Mom and Dad first.'" Malva, I'll take you to bed now. It's really late. Good night, Malva. - Good night. Let's go home. Tuure. I'm not sure moving to the country was a good idea. Harri is a really good man, and we've been together a long time. And it's valuable... The depth. What it brings to the relationship. The divorce was tough on our daughter. They say the parent's relationship is the child's home. That's a damn stupid thing to say. You don't have to explain anything to me. What I think of Harri and your relationship doesn't matter. Well, you know nothing about our relationship. You just don't like him because... - Because what? Because I want you. I feel so good with you. I'd be pissed no matter who you were with. We've known each other less than a week. I can't choose you. - That's right. That's why I'll go to the sauna, and you'll go to bed. And in the morning I'll leave. Go. It was idiotic to start a farm. We know nothing about farming. I'm tired of doing the right thing and saving the world! I don't want to be self-sufficient. I want to shop! Besides, we agreed I could write my master's thesis - when I stop breastfeeding Malva. Now she eats with a fork and a knife, - but I still have no time for myself. I'm tired of this. I know. I've tried to help you, but I don't know how. I feel like I fail at everything. I break everything, but I can't fix anything. Nothing grows, and we're out of money. Moving to the country was a shitty idea. And probably mine. I'm sorry. I can't do anything right. I can't even get you pregnant. I've been on the pill. What? - Contraceptives. You understand what torture... Fuck! You realize I've been questioning my manhood - because I thought I also failed at getting you pregnant? This has ruined our sex life and closeness. What kind... What kind of person secretly takes the pill - when her partner is trying for a baby? But... I don't think I can be a mother. There's something missing. I don't feel a connection. You have it. I can see it. You and Malva share something I'm not part of. She doesn't need me. But don't think I don't love her. Of course not. Everything will be all right, honey. Everything will be all right. Are you finished with your oatmeal? - Yes. Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning. You want to hide, and I'll count to a hundred? Then I'll come look for you. Okay? I'm so damn tired. - How did it go? I mean, what's she doing there? - Thinking. Where's Mom? - She's at this really nice hotel. She has to rest a bit. She's always tired. Malva, how do you feel - about sleeping in your room tonight? I don't think it'll work. - Okay. But next week we'll start practicing it. Why can't we have two lives? - Yeah. Do you have any good advice for me? - For once, I can't think of any. Shit. Bye. Drive carefully. - Yeah. It's pretty funny. Everything is fucked up, but... ...I haven't felt this calm in ages. She'll come back. Actually. I think we'll go to her. To the city. I realized here I'm a sociologist, not a farmer. And somehow it doesn't even give me anxiety. If something ends, it doesn't mean - it was in vain, does it? It just ends. This province will lose a wonderful farmer when you leave. By the way, you can stay here for New Year's if you want. For free. I have a trip booked to Vienna. - Sure, if that's your thing. Personally I don't understand Central Europe at all. It's not dark enough there. I hear they have cafés and culture - and things like that. I don't know, dammit. I once visited Paris in the spring. Never again. Dad! I'm still up! Alrighty.
