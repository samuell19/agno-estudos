Take care of yourself. -Can I ask about the future of another patient? -No. You know hospital policy. -Sorry. [Announcement on PA] -The next and last stop is Queensboro Plaza. -Stop. [Sobs] -[Speaking indistinctly] You have a great day. [Lock clicks] -Benita? You're home! -Sorry. I should have called before I coming. -Oh, what are you talking about? Are you okay? -Mm-hmm. -Huh? What about school? -Yeah. Well, I missed you, Mommy. -Oh. -I wanted to see you. Here. -Oh, gracias. Here, let me take your coat. -Thank you. -You look skinny. -I got it. -You losing weight? -Maybe a little. I don't know. Just been busy. -Well, you have to eat no matter how busy you are. Huh? -I know. -When did you cut your hair? -A few weeks ago, I guess. -Oh. -I -- -But it's covering your face. -What? -Qué pena. I'm sorry, I... What were you saying? -Nothing. -Are you sure? -Mm-hmm. When did the turn Posies in a Starbucks? -Ah, Maria, pobrecita. She got deported. -What? -Mm. -Why? -Failure to report a change of address or something like that. She moved across the street because the rent was too high. -But she had a green card. -Si. -[Speaking Spanish] -[Speaking Spanish] -Sorry. When did she leave? -Eh, I think about two months ago. Yeah, it was two months. Come, eat. [Sighs] -What? -What what? -Why you're staring at me. -I'm not staring at you. I'm -- I'm just looking at you. -It's weird. -Oh. I'm sorry. I'm just so happy to have my baby home. Mwah, mwah, mwah. My baby. Well, here. Have some of this. What do they call that? Curtain? -Curtain bangs. Mm-hmm. -Hmm. -Good morning. -Morning. -Did you sleep good? -Mm-hmm. -I'm going to mass later, if you want to join me. Unless you have classes. -Mami. I'm going to take some time off from school. -I don't understand. You said you were loving it. It was going so well. -I'm just burned out, I guess. -It's an education. So many people would do anything to get an education. -Please don't be mad at me. Can I just stay here for a while till I figure things out? -Claro. Are you pregnant? -No. -Well, I had some good news today. -What? -Your Uncle Alvaro was released from prison after those protests. -Is he okay? -He's alive. I guess I will see you later. Have a good day. -Bye. [Fog horn blaring] -Can I join you? -Sure. -So yeah, new in town. -Where are you from? -Um, Indiana. So, what are you studying at school? -Economics. I chose a practical major. It's probably easier to get a job that way, you know? -Don't you want a job you love? -In theory. -Okay. I moved here for work. -Mm-hmm. -And I start in a week. -Is this something you love? -It is. Finance. -Mm. So you like numbers? -I do. -[Laughs] -I really do. Um, really great getting to know you. -I'll see you. Bye. -Bye. -Stop! [Sobs] -If you say anything... to anyone...

They ask about you all the time. Marco, you should see him. He's gotten so big. -I still can't believe Angie has a kid. -Hmm. You're not little girls anymore. -No. -Mira. For good luck. One foot in front of the other. -It's just overwhelming. -Decide. It is not overwhelming. Benita. Cuidar, mi amor. -Benita. Yo, what are you doing here? -I just -- I wanted to see you. Talk to you. Say hi. -How -- how's school? -I don't know. -You good? -I think so, yeah. "My candle burns at both ends, but it did not last night." Do you remember? I read that to you. -You read me a lot of things. -What are you doing tonight? Are you guys together? -We're engaged. -Oh, wow. Congratulations. -We all have to start our lives at some point. -Mm-hmm. -You know? We deserve happiness, or at least a shot at it. -Are you happy? -You should come visit my sister some time. She'd be really happy to see you. -Congratulations. Have a good night. [Laughter] [Siren wailing] [Siren wailing in distance] -Hi. -Good day? -Not really. -It'll get better, It has to get better. -You want me to finish this? -Yeah, go ahead. -You okay? -Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. -Superstitions aren't working. -Ah. You have to court. Good luck. Real it in slowly. Every precious thing matters. Your father was a lot like you. So curious. You have always been so -- -It's not curiosity, Mami. -[Speaking Spanish] -Mami, I am panicking. I have so many loans to pay off. I don't know what I'm doing with my life. -But you got a scholarship. -Yeah. That didn't pay for everything. -But you have to count your blessings for the opportunities you have. -No, you don't understand. -And pray. Just pray. -[Gasps] Such a big boy. [Speaking Spanish] -I needed this. Chardonnay. Just like The Real Housewives do it. Heard you still haven't been to mass. -You talked to my mom? -Now, Father Joseph said. -Oh. -Someone hasn't been the confession in a while. -I fucking hate confession. -Yeah. Who doesn't? -Keeps you honest, though. More importantly, it keeps your neighbors honest. Anthony said you looked good. -He looks good, too. -Heard you sprang a little poetry on him. -[Sighs] -Don't worry. I can tell you, Roberta is not reading him poetry. -Roberta? I never saw that coming. -He wasn't enough for you. We both know that. -I don't know about that. -What? So you want him back? -No. I don't know. I -- I went over there to see how he was doing. -Okay. Is that why you came back? -I don't fucking know. It's fucking nuts out there. It's better to be home. I'm going to find a job and stay home. -That's annoying. -What? -You were so good at school. And now it's like not important. -Okay, it's not what it looks like on the outside. Are you mad at me? -No. I'm just confused. Okay. So Carlos works in the kitchen here. -Okay. -And he says there's a message board where they post job offers. It's right on the left when you walk in. Act like you belong. Like when we went to that Lizzo concert. -♪ I just took a DNA test ♪ ♪ Turns out I'm 100% that... ♪ -[Talking baby talk] -Winshaw and Kessler, antiquities, rare objects, fine art, sales clerk needed. Isn't that like an auction house, like Sotheby's? -I don't know. -"Expert knowledge of art and antiques is essential." Sounds like an asshole. -It's a fucking job. -How many of those have you had? -Are in counting? -I have an interview tomorrow. -Here? -Mm-hmm. -I don't know. -What? -Let me see your hands. -My hands? -Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This won't do. -Mami! -You have to look stylish. -I'm not going in there to kiss ass. -You need a job. And this world is different. Let me tell you. Trust me. Just walk as if you have all the time in the world. Speak slowly. Have a slight air that everyone you're talking to is lucky to talk to you. -That's so arrogant. -Oh, come on. Let me tell you something. The women that I make hats for, oh, you should see them. It's like they're gliding or something like that. Slow, easy they go. -You're making me nervous. -Oh, I'm not making you nervous. Come on. Come on. Loosen up, loosen up. Oh, we have to do something about the makeup. -I know how to do my makeup. -No, I know you do, but it should be different. Here, trust me. Let me show you something. [Speaking Spanish] [Bell rings] -Morning, madam. -Good morning. I'm here for the sales position. Is it still available? -You saw our listing at the Colony Club? -Yes, I did. -Come in. Do you know about antiques? -Yes, my family has a few good pieces. -This is an 18th century coiffeuse. It would be placed in a lady's dressing room. It's intended for applying makeup, but it can also be turned into a desk so a lady could tend to her correspondence. -It's in beautiful condition. -Let's have some tea. -I'd love to. -[Slurps] The job requires greeting and assisting clients, to be attentive, yet unpresuming, knowledgeable, yet unpretentious, mild mannered, yet gaining a sale. [Chuckles] A balancing act requires trapeze precision and... Karsavina grace. -Karsavina. -The Russian ballerina. -Yeah. Yes, of course. -The skill I most require in this job is being able to tell a story. See this? This, this is an 18th century German rococo toiletten tisch. Another ladies vanity table. But unlike the one we saw earlier, this is light enough to be carried from room to room and can be used for writing, playing cards, having tea. [Chuckles] This belonged to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's older sister. This little table and its varied uses sat in the same room day after day as the world's greatest composer learned his scales as a little boy. -I see. -Mm-hmm. -And this parrot made out of cardboard was done by Joan Miró's grandson, influenced by his grandfather's dedication to surrealism. The vibrance of this piece is the voice of the unheard. -I love the sound of parrots. -I got it. [Laughs] -[Speaking Spanish] Promise me you will go back to school. Okay? -What are you doing? -I'm not needed here anymore. -What? -It's okay. [Sighs] I need a few minutes alone. I'll meet you back at the house. -Okay. -[Groans] -What's this? -Nothing. My 10 years is coming up. They want me to renew. -You've been putting it off for years. I think it's time to apply for citizenship. -I don't want to talk about that. -I can help you study. -Your father would be so proud of you. -It's enough that you're proud of me, Mami. What are you going to do? Angie! -Yeah? -I got it. -You got the job? [Gasps] [Groans] That's so good! -[Laughs] We have to celebrate. Let me grab some rum. This is all I got for now. [Laughs] -Perfect. -Go, go. -Come on. -Enjoy yourself. -Make way for this girl. She got a job. [Indistinct shouting] -Thank you. Cheers. -[Laughter] -[Laughs] -Hi. I'm Diana. -I'm Benita. -Benita? [Laughter] -I love scarves. I just can't figure out how to make them. I want to do so many things. I just don't know how. -Do you want me to teach you? -Really? -Sure. -Okay. [Laughs] -So you move this over the needle. -Mm-hmm. -Like that. -Okay. -You fold. And you count the number of times you do it. How long have you been here for? -Too long. You hide it under your tongue and spit it out. -Good girls. -She doesn't care. -Why don't you take your medicine? Don't you want to get better? -I like the voices in my head. But most days I'm not sure whose side they're on. You know, at least I feel alive. [Beads clatter] -Why are you in here? -I've been given various diagnoses. Hysterical, delusional, depressed, manic. All fancy words for a bad egg. But, you know, it's not in here that makes you crazy. It's out there. What everyone wants from you, what they want to make of you, who they think you should be. Did I do it? -Mm-hmm. [Chuckles] It looks really good. -Not bad. -So start the next row. -You're a good teacher. -I'm... I'm just teaching you the way my mom taught me. -You have a nice mommy? -Um... I mean, yeah. -My mom put me in here. [Sizzling] -Most of our clients have no imagination. They need to see the pearls on a pretty girl. Wear what you wish from this table. Just put the pieces back at the end of the day. Unless you sell it, of course. Ms. Hennessy. My favorite. -Can -- can I help you? -You haven't any Murano glass, have you? No red earth tones. I want something special. Do you have anything blue? -Oh, I just love Murano glass, but unfortunately, we don't have any. We do have this stunning, rare Northwood Leaf umbrella amber cased cruet. -I want Murano glass. -Are you -- are you sure? [Door opens, closes] -What did she get? -Uh, nothing. -And why is that? -Because we didn't have what she was looking for. -No, you're wrong. They don't know what they want. It's your job to tell them. Get them to use their imagination. Wait up. Tell me what you think about this set. -Uh, this is our Plymouth tea set. It is in wonderful condition. Considering its long travel across the sea. -So you mean a symbol of freedom? -Yes. Touch it. You can feel the American history on your fingers. Making any house a real American home. -That's better. -[Laughs] Thank you. -The finest pieces my partner sends back from his travels. The Winshaw in Winshaw and Kessler. He travels the world in search of the most precious items. This arrived only this morning. He was on a dig in Turkey and made a remarkable discovery. An ancient Greek amphora. Winshaw attributed it to the Harrow painter, 470 to 480 BC. Careful. Finding the most obscure and unique objects is his passion. I never know where he is in the world or when he's going to return, but he always manages to send back great finds just when we need it. -Is this with commission? -Nope. I have to sell something first. -You better sell something. They can get rid of you at any time, you know? Is this before or after taxes? -Before. -Ay dios mio. you should go back to school and become a doctor. Then you never have to worry. -Did you hear back from immigration yet? -I have an appointment next week. -Good. -Bueno. Okay. Your first paycheck. Congratulations. -Thanks. -Benita, can you quickly clean the limoge tea and coffee service and the gold rimmed Baccarat champagne flutes, but do not place them together because they will clash. And make sure this jewelry is laid out on the table. -Is it a special occasion? -Yes. Yes. Some potential new clients are coming today, so we must have ready coffee, tea, champagne, whiskey, whatever they require. -Of course. -Karsavina grace, Benita. Karsavina grace. -Yes. When -- when will they arrive? -Oh, I don't know. This pair, these clients, such people, they never make appointments. And if they do, they never keep them. So if they buy from us, everyone will buy from us. So we must be ready and waiting. Well, Benita, I think it's time to close up shop. -Maybe we should wait a few more minutes. -No, no, no. It's done. But tomorrow is another day. -Sorry. -It happens. [Bell rings] Uncork the champagne. It's them! Mr. Van de -- Miss Van Der Laar! How lovely to see you. Please come in. Come in. May I introduce my associate, Benita Parla. [Chuckles] And, please. Some champagne? -Yeah. -There you are. -Thank you, Benita. -Of course. -Thank you. -Please have a look. Thank you. Yes, please peruse. -I love art nouveau. But my dress is more '70s inspired. Jimmy. Jimmy. -Do both. -It has to be perfect. -Oh, I-I'm sure either would look beautiful on you. -What's your name? -Uh, Peter. P-Peter Kessler. -Peter. I'm Diana. -Yes. -Let me just have a minute to think. -Of course. Yes. Might I inquire, is it a special occasion you're preparing for? -Oh, it's an occasion. -Uh-huh. -The museum is putting our family name on one of their wings. And my sister is the guest of honor. -Because of Dad. -And the museum loves you. To my dear sister Diana, who bestows this fine city with her artistry. Cheers. -Cheers. And congratulations. -Thank you. [Laughs] Hmm. Oh. I think I'll do the layering look. And I'll just get a simpler dress. -All right. So both pieces? Benita, would you please do the honors. And I'll do the math. [Chuckles] And may I just say, I actually have one of your father's prints just above my fireplace. -Oh, which one? -Uh, Tulips in March, 1991. Beautiful. -Inspired by Diana and their mornings at Gramercy Park. -You came, too. [Chuckles] We would go to the park after Dad was finished painting. He would paint all night, and we would fight over the swings. Remember, we would get hot chocolate sometimes. -Mm-hmm. -Do you think the place is still open? Can we go? -Yeah. -There's your total. And you can just... Thank you. -Benita! I know where I've seen you before. Remember, you were at, um... You were at my table at the Diamond Ball with, um, Aaron and Lauren. -Yes. It was a beautiful night. -It was, wasn't it? -It was so beautiful. -And successful. Didn't you raise $4 million that night? -Yes, uh, it I believe so. -Talented and beautiful. -You were there, too, correct? -I was. -Well, it's been an absolute honor serving you. And thank you very much. Please come again. -Bye, Paul. -Bye-bye. -Bye. -Thank you, James. -Bye. -It was nice seeing you. -You too. -Well, you're a woman of many faces. [Sighs] [Horn honks] -Are you going to tell me what's going on? -Your tio Alvaro is very sick. We don't know how much time he has. He was always so good to me. He would tell me the best stories when I was a little girl to help me fall asleep. He would pick a fight with our father so that my father wouldn't come after me. He was the one who helped me to come here. He wanted a better life for you. I just want a simple life. People being good to each other. Kindness. Benita, you must always protect yourself. Do you understand? -Stop! -So tell me, how was your day? -I made a sale. -You did?! -Mm-hmm. -Oh, that's so good! That's good! Oh. Oh. -There you are. Careful. [Knocking] -Take her out to lunch. -No, no, no, no. It's fine. It's okay. -No. Enjoy being young. Go on. -Really? -Mm-hmm. -I've been trying to forget my memories. Sometimes I think... ...isn't it better to not remember the times you were happy? -Or better to make new ones. -Are you happy working at Winshaw Kessler? -You know, I'm starting to get used to the smell of aged wood and silver, polish and furniture oil. -[Laughs] -And... -All those pretty things. You are like a jewel in your own jewelry box. -I didn't think of it like that. I do feel like I'm in another time when I'm there. -What time? -Sometimes the '20s, the '50s. -And you get to touch everything, right? -Yeah. And polish it. -Wow. That part is cool. Like, I think of where each piece has been. -Mm, what happened to that lamp that was sitting in that room? -Oh, Were people having sex right next to it? -Yeah. [Laughs] -Yeah. -Yeah. Maybe. -You know, how did that go about? -[Laughs] -Who were these people? -Yeah. I don't know. But... -How long have you worked there? -Um, not long. It wasn't easy to find a job. -What? -When did -- when did you get out? -A couple of days ago. -Well, I'm so happy to see you. -I'm happy to see you, too. It was horrible in there without you. I couldn't believe it when you left. It's like you just disappeared. -How -- how did you get out? -Mm. Oh, yes. I convinced them that I was no longer dependent on the habit of escaping my difficulties. That I had regained touch with reality. And I was now going to recover and live a normal life. [Chuckles] A normal life. Who in the world would want something so small? -Most people don't have a choice. -That's sad. I'm happy for you. [Clink] -Thank you. -I mean, you get yourself a job. You really turned your life around. No one knows you in the hospital, right? -No. -Okay, good. Yeah. You didn't tell anybody? -No, no. -You'll be marked for life. Trust me. -No, I wa-- I wasn't planning on it. -We're going to do great. Second chances. -Yeah. Second chances. -How was your lunch? -It was really nice. I had really good spaghetti. -Oh, I do love some pomodoro. Oh, could you close up tonight? I have to leave early. I have tickets for the opening night of the ballet. -Yeah, right. Of course. That's tonight. -Oh, were you planning on attending? -I had to give my seats away. I have another commitment. -Too bad. There's nothing like an opening night. I still get butterflies. -Yeah, there's definitely like a little bit of amber. -A little bit of shit browns. It's the lighting. [Laughs] -No, it's not. Let me see.
