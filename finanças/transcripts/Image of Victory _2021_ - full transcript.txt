There are moments when you try to make sense of your life. You wonder if you made good use of the time God gave you on this earth. You seek someone to compare yourself to. Someone you think truly lived. And sometimes you're surprised by who comes to mind. She's the one who came to my mind. It's crazy. Of all the men and women I met in my life... It's her I cannot forget. And I know it doesn't make sense. Because she's the enemy, right? But I can't get that image out of my head. What was it that made her smile? Did she know what was going to happen? Has she figured out what I've been trying to figure out all my life? "Finally, after 30 years of bloody wars, a peace agreement will be signed "between the two rival states, Egypt and Israel... "The President of Egypt took a courageous step..." You filthy dog... We fought the Israelis for years to help our Palestinian brothers but this peace agreement doesn't solve anything! Sadat's a traitor! And I'm a coward... Hassanin... Are you alright? You've been depressed for a week. Dinner's on, my love. If there was no reason for the war, and they are making peace just like that... then I've been misleading the people who read my newspaper columns, telling them the war is just... They fought... and died. And if their deaths were in vain, who's to blame? Who? I am! I'm the one who should yell out that our president is a traitor. If I had the courage, if I wasn't scared of doing something so extreme... You wrote what you believed in, about the King and about our country. You're Egypt's greatest journalist. An oak tree breaks in a storm, but a bamboo shoot merely bends and straightens again. Let's eat. A bent bamboo shoot... That's what I have become? How pathetic... I go back and think of her... of what she dared to do. What does it say about me? What I must do? I go back to myself at 24, not afraid of anything, on the last night of 1947. Such mayhem... Come, he's in the screening room. He asked me to go get you. Tell me... what's this job? Why the secrecy? You'll soon know. You love movies, don't you? You know I do. But why the mystery? The producer will tell you. "The annual royal charity banquet was held this week in Cairo. "King Faruk, beloved by his people, "visited backstage to thank the dancers who entertained the esteemed guests." Turn off the projector. What are you doing? What are you thinking? Showing the king fondling these young ladies?! The Queen should see this!? Our King is only interested in charity, not girls. Right?! Answer me! -I'm sorry, sir. -Sorry? Want them to shut us down? Do you ever use your head? Excuse me... Mr. Amin? You asked to see my friend right away before the volunteers leave tonight. You said it was urgent. Is that the guy that writes for newspapers? Yes, sir. But his passion is cinema. Is your friend brave? What's your name? Hassanin. Your ID... The Zionists act like heinous predators and they deserve retribution. I've studied the Jewish soul and realized that they have boundless ambitions. They believe it's the land of their forefathers. They come to Palestine from every direction, from Europe, from South America, from Asia, like locust descending on a field of crops. And how will they to get rid of the good people? Good Arabs, living on their lands for centuries. These foreigners colonized our sacred land in order to expel our brothers. Look here, across from the peaceful village of Hamama, by the road from Gaza to Jaffa and Tel Aviv, those sons of dogs built a colony called Nitzanim. This place, Nitzanim, where, as I later found out, lived the girl with the mysterious smile. Was a place I've never heard of. On that night I was fascinated by the passion and ideological fervor of the young volunteers I joined, in order to send newsreel stories from the battlefield, which will be screened in theatres before the movie. At first, going to a warzone sounded very frightening, but this was an opportunity to make cinema - my greatest love. As Tolstoy wrote, love and fear are always inseparable. Grab him if he starts running before the truck halts. It's dangerous. Listen up everyone, I expect you to behave like soldiers, not hooligans! Danny, I'll race you! Let's see who gets the presents first. Hard to tell which one's more childish... Being childish is natural for a child... A childish mother... that's dangerous. Daddy! Who missed Daddy the most? Any of you ladies want to go back to prison? Who's he calling "ladies"? Elyakim! Did you get the book about Holstein cows? Keep your rifles handy at all times! We came to this settlement to protect these people. Romek! Why did they send us crappy soldiers straight from prison? Should we complain? -Not now. Prison soldiers are better than no soldiers at all. Naomi, go get mattresses for the soldiers. Listen up, if you want to sleep tonight. You take a sack... Fill it with hay... Thanks. And make yourself a mattress. Close it tightly with rope so it doesn't open at night and all kinds of things... Will get under your nightwear... I'd like to have my thing get under her nightwear. Jamus, ever been with a redhead? -Down there it glows in the dark. Redheads or fireflies? -Excuse me. -What? Soldiers, I used to play the violin. I have perfect hearing, just like a dog. And just like a dog she keeps barking. Enough is enough! The sea is one kilometer away. Swimming in the middle of winter? Are you insane? Not swimming, if we had up the coastline, it's 50 kilometers to Tel Aviv. -We already did time for desertion. Wasn't it worth it? Mira, may the commander contact the Battalion? -Sure. I don't get why they didn't give you a radio. The Battalion couldn't spare it. We'll make do. Who do you need? -The Battalion Commander. There's a tractor's carburetor waiting for me. -No problem. Why are you standing? Have a seat. Iron Gate, this is Sparrow, do you copy? Your son. Cute. A big boy. Independent. Are you a fan? What? -Marlene Dietrich, the actress. Are you a fan? I don't go to the movies much. How do you listen to the album? Do you have a record player here? -At the dining hall. It hurts. I can't feel my leg. It hurts! It really hurts! Don't move! We'll draw the fire to us. Fire! Attack! Lieutenant, it's over on our end! -Same here. Habani, run and tell them they can evacuate the wounded. The infirmary is on the second floor. Should we tie the bastard to a tree? To scare off other assassins. He's not an assassin. He's just a child. Some of our men can handle weapons, but even if you train us, we don't have enough men to work in the fields and guard.... And what's worse, it's only the beginning. Today it's Arab farmers, tomorrow we may face greater dangers. I want to bring food to the guys on guard. Can you fill up these mess tins? I'll handle this. How about sending us more weapons? Everyone's short on supplies. 8 milking cows is 42 gallons a day? Eight for here, 34 for sale! Yerach, to make a profit you need 100 gallons... It's not a good idea to have children in such a dangerous place... But a place without children is a place without life. The doctor! He's OK. Truth is... You're surprised he didn't die on me. Even a blind hen sometimes finds a grain of corn. Bravo, Doctor! Good job! Ziggy! Play like in Berlin you did. Play with them! I don't want to intrude. -Why intrude? Didn't you say you miss the piano? Go, play for them. But play in a modern style. Ziggy, make it modern... more modern... Decadent music, here? Excuse me, this is not a night club. Excuse yourself. Music is music. We're not puritans. Nothing is forbidden here. -I didn't say it's forbidden, I said it's not our way. The "way" argument is getting old... -But it's still important. Young lady, shall we dance? Shall we? I'm a true gentleman, I swear... Kilometer, let me have a spin. Let me dance a little. You're called Kilometer? Why Kilometer? Why Kilometer? He weighs a kilo and he's a meter tall... Kilometer. Don't you dance, Ben Gigi? Sergeant Ben Gigi. We come from the same neighborhood but here you either call me Sergeant, or Sergeant Ben Gigi, or Sir. But not Ben Gigi. Is that clear? Take five, then back to work. Want to dance? -Are you kidding? I don't dance with animals. Animals? -Animals... You're called Jamus, right? -So..? It means "ox" in Arabic, right? That means you're an animal, doesn't it? It's time... -Time for what? Time for bed... Go to Hadassa and ask to cut in. -It's not cool. She's dancing with that soldier. -What's not cool? You're nothing but trouble, Mira, I swear. Nothing but trouble. "This is radio Alexandria at 82 Megahertz" Cigarette? Thank you, Mr. Hassanin. Hassanin will do. No need for "Mr. Hassanin". Say Youssef, have you seen the documentary film "Why We Fight" by Frank Capra? I'm at work all day. I have to work hard to make a living. I think Capra should be the inspiration for our films. Moving stories about simple people, who find themselves in a moral and just war. We may be filming newsreels but there's no reason why it can't be art, and really say something about the human condition. Do you agree? Big dreams... Meantime, we only drove at night, not to be seen. The plan was to split up and each force would attack a colony. Good morning. Sorry for waking you up, but... I'm driving to the city and will be back tomorrow. If you want me to bring anything for you... Have a good trip. Mira... Mira... Elyakim, please... I'd just like you to hold me tight, like you used to, before we... -Elyakim... You know we're no longer... Do you want me to fake it? Not to be sincere...? I'm sorry, I really am. If I'll feel differently, I'll tell you. -I don't know what to do. Me too. You asked me not to do anything drastic, I don't. You asked me to act like everything's fine, I am. But what... What's wrong? What's the problem? I'm not blaming you... What has changed? And why did it change? -I don't know. I'm sorry, you know you're important to me. It doesn't matter who attacks you, size doesn't matter. Habani, enough with the joking. Got it? Need another demonstration? You know, it's easy to flip me over because I'm not really trying to hit you. Fine, hit me for real. -For real for real? -For real for real. Use the rival's momentum to flip him over. Again. Slower this time. Got your eye on anyone? Don't think so. -You think too much. Easy for you to say. -Why? Because you're... Mira. What does that mean? Oh, come on... Romek, wait... platoon, pair up and practice. So here's what we do... Jamus, this is no bordello... You, as community leader, you're in charge, right? You give the orders, tasks... -This is not the army. There are no orders. We hold meetings and the comrades make decisions. But for example, who decide on security matters? "General", what do you want? That lady, Mira... I understand the radio belongs to the kibbutz but we'll need it for operations -What operations? Like in the Arab village across. So you want the radio but not the girl in the bargain, right? Good luck with that. -I don't get it. -You will, eventually. Mira is special. Different. Different how? I still don't get it. It's raining cats and dogs... I knocked. There was no answer, so I waited. Elyakim is away and I put Danny to bed in the children's quarters. He never sleeps with you? And your husband? That's the Kibbutz way. Want to come in? I don't want to intrude. -You're not intruding. Want some coffee? No. I'm... I'm planning a patrol to map the village across. It's nonbelligerent and I don't expect problems... But it's better to have a radio, just in case. -Smart thinking. I like people who think ahead. But... I need your radio. In case something goes wrong. Gladly. Oh... excellent. Hand it over or...? -I'll gladly join you. Mira... -Don't start... -Listen... If you want me to confiscate it, I will. -But you can't. It's the kibbutz's property. Sorry, you'll have to put up with me. So why be difficult? We reached Hamama village at night. Our commander, Lieutenant Khlef, started planning the attack right away. He was the only professional military man among the volunteers. An interesting character. On one hand, an educated man and on the other, a zealot. The good people of the village were very happy we came to help them. Perhaps, thanks to us, they'll be able to return to the lands they once cultivated. I thought I'd have great human dramas to film here. Stab with the bayonet and twist. Who's here ever slaughtered a lamb? It's the same drill with no wool. Salman, it's your turn now. Do you want to tickle him or stick him? If you're that clueless, I should get you some dogs to practice on. I'm kidding. Who's next? Youssef, check out this photogenic young man. What do you mean? Are you sure? -Of course. Really? -Yes. Ready. Our main story was the liberation of Palestinian lands. But every big story is made up of many little stories. And on our first week, we identified the beginning of a very cinematic love story. This highway is the lifeline of the colony. Not far, near the Isdud Bridge, there's a military camp. From there, supplies are sent to the colony Nitzanim. And from that colony, produce is sent for sale in Tel Aviv. And we... God's emissaries... will make life very miserable for them. At high noon we stand outside Our plates at ready for mess A day will come we'll tell the cook To kiss us in the... Knee... Yula, Yula, Yulala Naomi the redhead Working hard around the clock But everyone can clearly see All she needs is a big co... Company. Company. -Company. Naomi, Naomi, Naomi-nom If you don't mind, it smells as badly as those diapers. When she heats up She takes off her sweater... Why don't you complain to their commander? He'll yell at them. No need to. They're little boys. Don't pay attention. Poor things, after toilets' duty, I couldn't get the stench out of my hair for a week Eventually, I went swimming. -That's an excellent idea. Should we go to the beach after work? Even if it's winter. I don't understand why they don't send us more mines. It's not enough. We're going to the beach this afternoon, so if you need the radio... I don't mind. Of course, I'll take it back as soon as we return. Do you have someone trained to use it? -Yes. Just tell him it's sensitive. It needs to be handled gently. I... I need to check up on the digging... How deep... What digging? Never mind. Anything else? You didn't confirm you'll return the radio. You're difficult. You're difficult, I'm difficult. What do you say? Do you go to the beach regularly? Even in such times? Yes, we go often, why? I'll send a couple of soldiers with you, just in case. What do you think? When we'll have children, will we teach them Spanish? It's important for them to know the culture we came from. It's important to be able to talk with them without our husbands' understanding. So, if there's a problem with the husband... There'll be no problems. We'll have wonderful husbands. Swimming in the winter? Isn't it cold? Cold water stimulates your circulation. What's with the fancy words? Circu-what? Sorry. The flow of blood. Look at her showing off again... Got a problem? God help us... Aren't you going for a swim? Didn't bring our bathing suits. Who needs bathing suits? Got socks? Take a sock, put it on your thingy, put a rubber band around it, and you're good. You're kidding. Not kidding. Suit yourselves. The water's great. That Mira, she's sick in the head... Why? It's funny. A guy's thing in your face is funny? It's gross... What do you say, Habani? Not on your life... I don't care... What's the problem, Habani? Small dick? Small brain? -Habani, don't be shy. Next time, bring a smaller sock, say, of a four-year-old. And leave the weapon unattended? So now you're an exemplary soldier? Not an exemplary soldier, but... -In other words... small dick. Casanova, this is your chance to make a move. -Cut it out, you nudge. Come on, dip in, it's not that cold. You guys are idiots. You're just idiots. To the sea... Small brain. Small dick. Let's go... -No! Come on... -Cut it out! Hello, esteemed ladies. Water's too cold for you? Is the water too cold for you too? Bitch... Mira, where are you going? Ada, come help me. We'll dunk him in the water. I thought you had better taste. What better taste? We're just having fun. A civilized person doesn't make a move on a girl like that. Enjoying yourself? Yes. First time since I'm in the army that I'm enjoying myself. It's paradise here. Paradise. You'd think it's paradise if being here wasn't risking death. What were the words of the poet? Whoever fears death, fears life. Coffeehouse romanticism. Get down! I don't get you. This is not a film studio, this is real life. Fire! Guys! Come on out! Jamus, you idiot, hurry! Elyakim, where is it coming from?! Kilometer, hurry up already! I'm going in, cover me. Move in carefully. Jamil, pin him down. If it's a trap... -I know what to do! What are you filming? Why are you filming them looking like thieves? Are they thieves? No, they're heroes. Of course, but... Freedom fighters got to eat too and it's only human to take food parcels. We don't have time to argue. Salman, hurry up. We got to move out. Come on! Ben Gigi, to the right. Kilometer, to the left. Mosko... Better not... How can we work when they can shoot at us anytime? Who'll stop them? Twelve soldiers? You're joking? It is a joke, but a sad one. We're idealists, right? -Of course. But you must protect us. We have children here. -Comrades... You are all important to us. We planted mines on both sides of the gate... I'll say it! I'll say it! I'll say what everyone knows but I'll say it loud and clear! It's obvious that Brigade Commander Avidan and Kovner, that... Shall we call a spade a spade? That political officer, the real boss... What's a political officer? A political officer is like... in the Russian army, the man who has more clout than the top military commander. He works for the government and knows its agenda. They simply don't care about us. They don't care! I don't think politics are involved... It's very nice that you don't think, but these are not your children. These are our children. Ada, no need to speak in that tone. -Yerach, I'll speak however I want. We're talking about the lives of the children. Not cows. Good evening. Whatever... Is everything's alright? -They're at the dining hall. Party's on. What about the cows now? What do you mean? -Someone has to replace poor Mosko. You're alone. And now, with the new calf. Maybe a woman can help. Especially if she has experience with children. Come on Mira. A man was just killed. Which is why tomorrow he won't be helping with the milking. You need help to work the cowshed. It's Kovner... Good evening. Gentlemen... We asked for more weapons. Did we get any? We got the finger! We asked for soldiers. What did we get? One riffraff platoon! Losers, deserters, thieves... Insult me, not my soldiers, OK? These ambushes are just the beginning. It started with farmers and shotguns but now it's trained volunteers with proper weapons. What are you going to do about it? First of all, tomorrow, or the day after, maybe next week, If the moon and the weather are right... there'll be retribution. So we will kill them and they will kill us? How will that solve the problem? Is revenge the solution? This must be solved. These lands used to belong to them... All lands in the world used to belong to someone else but they're also yours and the argument will go on forever. We paid the landlord good money for this land. His tenant farmers should be angry at him, not at you. When we crawled out of the crematorium chimneys, some people here know exactly what I'm talking about, we realized that with all due respect to culture and civilization, people are also animals. And animals respond to "an eye for an eye". Elyakim, you'll return with us to Be'er Tuvia with your truck and we'll reload all that was lost today in the delivery. Only now, you'll be accompanied by an armored vehicle. As in all future trips you'll make. So this is solved. -It should be clear, if we capitulate first, we will all be kicked back... to where six million Jews were exterminated. Are you OK? I'm fine. -Don't be ashamed. It must have been very scary to see a friend dead from up close. Mira, I'm not scared or ashamed. Everything's OK. Good evening, Ada. -Good evening. Look how he's hugging his teddy bear. Don't wake him up. I really want to hear his mumbling. He has the sweetest voice in the world. Sometimes he talks to his teddy bear. It's cute. Cute? -Cute. Not a word you use often. Such a great kid... Oh, I'm sorry... I forgot my book... But it's not urgent. I'll give you some privacy. That's alright. They're waiting for me. Please tell Danny that I kissed him and that I'll buy him many presents... And that I'll be back in a few days. Goodbye. Hadassa, wait a second. I thought of something, since you're so good with children. As you know, Yerach's alone in the cowshed now, it's a lot of work for one person. I thought it could interest you even for a trial period, to see if working in the cowshed could interest you? Good evening. I came to take the radio back. Mira, I don't want to irritate you... -But you do. I apologize. But if we evacuate... I won't be evacuated. You're under my responsibility. All of you living here. -I won't be evacuated. You're a mother. -You're full of information. Just like Elyakim who nudged me about it before he left. We need to come up with some arrangement, you and me. Concerning the radio. This won't work. Listen, you went on patrol without the radio. You took a risk. That was unwise. You thought the Battalion'll send you a radio, but they didn't, right? So let's make a deal, you can borrow my radio any time, but if you go on a mission, I'm in. Done? A few days passed, a week, and another week, and we had nothing to film. Good morning. -Good morning. Lieutenant Khlef hoped the Jews would attack and he set up ambushes, but the Jews didn't attack. Why was there nothing to film? Why weren't there more ambushes? Because Nitzanim's truck was accompanied by an armored vehicle. Out of boredom, I stood and observed the colony. Actually, it seemed very normal. You see your enemy as a regular person and it does something to you. Since my producer and boss was very pleased with the footage from the ambush, I thought I should focus on our heroes' daily life And perhaps feature a budding love story... "The love story of Salmam, the courageous volunteer, "and Samira, the beautiful villager." What the hell?! What is this crap? How stupid is your friend? Who cares about this crap? He thought this love story could be interesting. He thought? Do I pay him to think? I pay him to film a war. like the footage he sent two weeks ago. That's what the audience wants, not a love story. If he has an issue with that, I'll can his ass. Is there a post office in the village? -Not in the village, there's one not far away, in Khan Yunis. Then send a telegram, and have the clerk mount his bike, donkey or camel, and deliver it to the acclaimed director. I'll also send a telegram to Colonel Aziz and ask him to send them reinforcements. Perhaps with a larger force, we'll see some progress and have something to show. Keep going. Very nice. Until I say stop. Up! Good. Everyone, down. Kilometer, where are you? Listen, I don't think It's a good idea... I'm just giving it a try. If it's no good, I'll be back. Good morning. Good morning. I was told I start working today... here, with you. Right? Yeah, they said a guy or a girl... I don't remember. But no problem... Keep in mind, work in the cowshed starts early, because the cows are full of milk, it hurts their... Their mammaries. Oh, like when you have a baby. Not you, me. Not me, I don't have a baby, but there are babies in the children's quarters. And there's a baby here too. So cute. Milking a cow... requires two steps. The first step is... It's... Massaging the mammary. A massage? Yeah, a massage. Here. See? To induce the milk flow from the mammary to the milk pool in the... In the nipple. You know what I mean? -I know what a nipple is. OK. So you need to squeeze the nipple to stimulate the flow... I'm sorry if this is unpleasant for you. -Why? Squeezing the nipple... Stimulating it... Sounds very pleasant. For the cow. Get over here... Open it up. Kilometer... Hurry up. Good evening. May I ask something? What do you want? Please let us advance with your fighters, so we can film everything up close. I don't really care how you film it, up close or from far away. Forgive me... but it makes a big difference. A story has as much significance as the act itself. That's how the cowards in Cairo talk. That's what cowards say. Cowards don't ask to advance with the fighters. The camera's is also a weapon. Even on Passover Eve they don't serve decent food. No knife and fork? What are we animals eating with our hands? Kilometer, come sit next to me. When the "party" starts, your job is to reload the machine gun, got it? Sergeant, keep in mind, as soon as the shooting starts, I'll start vomiting. You know that. If I'll crouch next to you... -Cut the crap. Man up. A grenade and a smoke grenade. Youssef. -Yes. Shall I take a weapon? just in case... If you carry a weapon, don't stand behind the cameraman, you might kill him. Take pity, your cameraman has children. Safer for him if you don't carry a weapon. Remember, once the climb starts we can't slow down. If anyone gets tired, there'll be time to rest in the hideout, before the shooting starts. Listen up ladies. So here's the deal, ladies... Why "ladies" -What? Oh, because you're ladies. OK, but why use a derogatory tone? "Ladies"? I didn't mean to insult... I always say "ladies"... OK, listen. Take watch-guard shifts on the water tower. Those down below will serve as runners. Good luck. Weapons locked. Be very quiet. We're nearly there. They're about 40 meters from the fence. Fire! It's me Salman, I'm hit, help me. I'm hit... Help me, it's Salman. Are we winning? Ladies, take only good shots. Don't waste bullets. We have a long day ahead of us. Salman! -Don't worry, it's not a bad injury. Jamil, take six men and flank them from the dune. Do you have wire cutters? Hadassa... Hadassa, Hadassa... Iron Gate, this is Sparrow. Phase 2. Repeat, phase 2. Roger that please. Over. Confirmed. Roger and out. Headed your way... Wait... Fire. Habani, hurry up. I'm hurrying up... We'll take cover here before we detonate. Habani, the detonator. We'll cover. Ready. Don't know what happened. We're pulling back. Over. It was hard to see all the devoted and courageous volunteers lying in the field hospital, without sufficient medical supplies and morphine. The saddest were the tenant farmers who were driven out of Nitzanim's lands they thought they would soon return to their previous life. There was hope and it was gone... Why? This was the first time I heard that in the squad that infiltrated the village, there was a woman who was no less of a hero than the men. I almost lost my own hero, Salman, but fortunately, his injury was minor. There can't be a drama without a hero. Lieutenant Khlef insinuated that I should send a telegram to my producer, saying that in the turmoil of battle, our footage got lost. He was extremely worried they'd say he's to blame for the defeat. I told him that of course, he wasn't to blame and I also mentioned that in the written narration I sent. But I'm committed to report the truth. I will not forget this. You're a traitor. If a story is a weapon as you say, then what you send is a weapon against me. I'm sending what we filmed. Maybe it'll make them realize that you... that we need help. I'm not doing anything against you. Let's go, Hassanin. Come on. Gentlemen, if the Jews declare today independence, we must dispatch our army right away. Our volunteers have no chance against the Jews' army. It's a complicated situation and the King's worried... Pardon my frankness, but we, the Egyptian people, will appear as weak cowards if it turns out that we deserted our brothers. The Generals told the King what they saw in the film. The King feared the people's reaction and ordered to burn all prints. The King also ordered the army to prepare to invade Israel within two months. I understand everyone's concern. Establishing a state surrounded by enemies is scary. In these isolated settlements, Yad Mordechai, Nitzanim, Kfar Darom, the residents talk about... I can't even utter the word... Evacuation. What evacuation? How evacuation? If we start evacuating here, where will it end? The story will spread immediately, all the settlements in the south will be evacuated and then there'll be panic up north. Will we evacuate Rehovot? Rishon LeZion? Tel Aviv? Where will we go? We have to hurry. -What did they say? No evacuation. Only children, as decided before. And mothers? -Their choice. Yes. Let's help them load. -Wait... And reinforcement? They have a reserve force they can send to rescue if necessary. They think the Egyptians will head for the bridge and ignore most isolated settlements. Weapons? More mines? Did they authorize them? -Some. An anti-tank rocket launcher. Did you argue with them? -As much as I could. But some arguments can't be won, right? What? Nothing. Go on. Songs you used to sing back there? Now I'm embarrassed... By me? Careful! Sorry. Lady, you shoved sand into my mouth. That's OK, you have a filthy mouth anyhow. See you. "General", what do we do? Evacuate? Romek, I command soldiers, not civilians. But you know that we're not the type who flee and headquarters can take advantage of that, right? Are you alright? There's a need for drivers for the convoys to Jerusalem. They asked me. And you agreed? Yes. I'll be away from here for weeks. We need to talk. -Alright. It's hard for me as it is. And people talk. Who cares? -I do. When women and children evacuate, will you leave? -Why does it matter? I won't leave you here alone. -Alone? What do you mean, alone? There's a whole kibbutz here. I meant without me. Mira, what should I do? Tell you I love you more than anyone else will? I can't take this separation. It hurts, I just don't understand! -Elyakim. Please. I'm hurting too. Sorry. She'll come without a bra, yes she will She'll come without top and I'll take her for a hop... You're using up all the hot water! It's our turn now! It's not fair. Come on! Get out already! You're in the shower for half an hour! Takes half an hour to wash out the sand you put in my mouth. Besides, Jamus is big. Takes forever to soap himself. Sons of bitches! Mira, what are you doing? What was that? Shooting? -Who's shooting? Let's go... Ada, come on, it's funny. You haven't laughed for so long. Well, that's worth something. Getting a smile out of you... Idiot. "In a few minutes, Ben Gurion will declare Israel's independence..." We're not educated as you are we're primitive just like the Arabs. Kilometer, people like you, afraid to fight, don't deserve independence. I'm not afraid to fight, I'm just against war. Why can't we reach understanding? -With who, Arabs? Ask Ziggy, was there much "understanding" in the concentration camp? Did they conduct polite public debates there? Ever talked with an Arab? -I'd be glad to... Ada, he saved a seat for us. He saved seats for you and Mira... It's obvious, he always saves a seat for Mira. But he only saved two seats on purpose. Clearly, he's trying to separate us. It's a festive night. Don't start. You spend all day with him in the cowshed, do you have to spend the evening too? OK, I sound crazy so I'll stop. Ada... Elyakim left? -Yes. -Then for whom did you dress up? You nudge, focus on your own romantic affairs, not mine. Your romantic affairs? Since when are you romantic? I'm as romantic as they get... Quit. It's the declaration. My only memento from back home My family... That was... I wanted them to be here today. To hear this. "We are listening to Ben Gurion, the Zionist leader of Israel. "A country which is not recognized by any of its neighbors. "He claims that Israel will be based "on the principle of historical justice. "But where is the historical justice for the Palestinians?" What are you filming? Our humiliation? So everyone will forever see how we failed? Get out! I don't want to humiliate anyone. It hurts me as much as you. But this is the story. Do you want me to shoot you? Go back to Cairo. To your hollow life. To your chatter and lofty words that lead to no action! I didn't mean any harm. The story's over. -I have great respect for you. But my job is to document. Turn off the camera! Avraham... They're happy at the dining hall. But I knew you're here. I brought you something to eat. Thanks. Are you worried? Contemplative... What? I wrote to my mom about you. What did you write? That there's someone... Don't worry, I didn't elaborate. Do you tell your mom everything? -As does she. When I was a child, she had a lover. She used to take me with him to hear music at the beach and eat ice cream. It was fun... It was fun sitting with her... and her lover? Didn't you mind? I love her. I didn't mind her doing what felt right for her. I don't believe you didn't mind. Maybe you felt helpless being put in that... Come quickly. I don't want anyone seeing us. I wonder if that guy is at her place... Poor Elyakim... Elyakim's wise. He's not a kid. He's not a kid... but they have a kid. They should have been careful. Us too. I don't know, a kid would be nice. I'm serious. My mom always said... -Look... "The Egyptian pilots dropped bombs on Tel Aviv's Central Bus Station. "There are 42 dead and 100 wounded. Some in critical condition... " They're ripping them apart. Your turn. Mr. Hassanin, Mr. Hassanin... What's going on, my friend, Salman? Talk to me. The Lieutenant asked you to come quick and bring Youssef too. What's there to film? What? I asked what is there to film? What happened? God is great. Judging by your smile, I can tell you managed to get rid of me for good. Is that right? Where are Youssef and I going? You're not going anywhere for now. Where's the cameraman? He'll be right here. You're being very dramatic. -Aren't you looking for drama? Everyone loves drama. Ready to film? Film what? Film me. Film him. Ready? Gone... Yad Mordechai... The Jews who were there fled like mice. Many of them died. Do you know what that means? It means that with God's grace, this is the beginning of the end of all the colonies. Sir, everyone here is worried. They want to know if we'll receive help... Avraham, I understand your situation but nothing can be done right now. I only authorize evacuation of women, children and medical cases. You'll get help in case of an attack. We all knew this day would come. We'll do what has to be done. From now on, we must speak in code. We're up against an army now, they have surveillance. Use your head. Roger out. Speaking code... Do you know code? Code? Sure. -Which code? Pig Latin code. -The what code? (In Pig Latin code) I... Love... you... No little girl ever said that to you? Daddy misses you very much and you miss him too, right? -Right. You'll go to him soon. He's waiting for you. He prepared many surprises for you. Ada, let's talk. -Did you pack? Not much to pack. It doesn't mix well. There are lumps and they'll spit it out and won't fall asleep. And if they start crying... we're all doomed. Maybe we should crush them first. Crush them? You're good at crushing... -Ada, please! Stop being angry at me, please. Enough, we're in a terrible situation. Exactly. That's why I don't want you pulling any stunts. We're not soldiers. And you're coming with me, right? We said that whatever happens, we'll always be together. That's our defense against life's surprises. We're family. You're my only family. A promise is a promise, right? It must be kept. Sleep, sweetie, sleep. Yerach will take you on a little trip. Dad's waiting and he has a surprise for you. Chocolate? -Yes, chocolate, sweetie. Please don't hate me, sweetie. Hold him tight, OK? For the last time... Are you sure? -I'm sure. All I'm saying is... -I told you I'm sure. Give Elyakim this letter. He should only open it if something... Mira, think again. By saying "only if something happens..." You obviously think... -I don't think anything, alright? Give Elyakim a big hug from me. Enough, please... See you in the morning. Are you OK? -You think? You're doing the right thing, we can't help around here. We're heading out. Forgive me. Hadassa... Hadassa! Go on. Sleep, Danny. Sleep, sweetie, sleep. Everything's alright. What happened? I'm sorry... I got scared. -Are you alright? I can't... fall asleep. There are leftover sleeping pills we gave to the children. I thought it'd be OK if I took some. Get down everyone! What are these explosions? -It's coming from the bridge. We need to hurry and get the kids to headquarters, to be back at Nitzanim by sunrise. Do you need help? Come to me... Sleep, sweetie. Thank you, Ada. I just wanted to say that... -You, you... If something happens to Hadassa, it'll be your fault. And I'll never forgive you. Her blood will be on your hands. Do you understand? (In Pig Latin code) Iron Gate... This is Sparrow, over. (In Pig Latin code) Sparrow... This is Iron Gate. Over. Has the package... arrived at your end? Over. Sparrow. The package is not here yet... I'll send someone to the gate... to check. Over. What? What did she say? They're not there yet. It's taking too long. According to plan, they should have already arrived. I... If something happened to them... To the children and to Ada... Mira, do you think something happened to them? Why have they not arrived yet? -I don't know. What a mistake... Why a mistake? Why a mistake? Because I knew it's dangerous here. I thought that if it'd get too dangerous, I'd send Danny away. I'm such a terrible person. Why didn't I see it coming? I didn't either. I'm not that brave. Neither is Ada... She's not as strong as she seems. Her mother and my mother are sisters. Her father lost all their money... He left them. Her mother started... drinking a lot. She's gone too. I'm the only one she got left... She'd never come here if I didn't... What's for her in a place like this? (In Pig Latin code) Sparrow. This is Iron Gate. Over. (In Pig Latin code) Iron Gate. This is Sparrow. Over. Sparrow. The whole package arrived. The birds will soon fly home. Over. Iron Gate. Thank you. Roger and out. Mira, let's go! What's going on? Tanks, trucks, cannons, armored vehicles... Maybe a thousand vehicles, headed north. They're not engaging us at the moment. Over. Can you identify the tanks? How many? Type of armored vehicles? Cannons? Over. I don't know. Tanks, I don't know. No identification yet. Excuse my inexact assessment, but it's lotsa lotsa lotsa tanks! Over. Our army could have easily destroyed Nitzanim but the Division Commander, had no interest in small fries. He wanted to get to Tel Aviv as soon as possible. An artillery battery commanded by Brigadier Naguib, was set up in the village. Naguib's task was to safeguard our logistics. Youssef and I left the village and joined the army to film the swift victory the General promised the King. But there was no victory. The attack failed because the General didn't send scouts. He didn't know that the Jews blew up the bridge leading to Tel Aviv. There were many casualties and some fell in Israeli captivity. It was a nightmare. The footage we shot was not the kind the king wanted to see. Start the screening. It was clear that we couldn't win this war and that our army had to return home. At home, once the soldiers talk, it will be curtains for the king. Hear that? Is that it? The flying fridge? Right on time. Let's go! Hurry up. Whose turn is it? Kilometer? -What? No! No, no, no, no. I did it last time. I think it's Jamus's turn. Rabbit derby duty? Habani, you're up. -Me? Never mind... I'll go. No way, Ziggy. -It's not your turn. I want to. To die? Are you sure? Why? I miss the piano. Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Scary as hell! One! Fire! Get down! Ziggy... let's go. Get going! Hurry up! Hurry up! -Hurry up! Hurry up! -Hurry up! Brigadier, if you may... can we just bomb the building and be done with it? That's not good sportsmanship. And it's dishonorable. The war's over. Damn them, bully beef again? Naomi, cut thick slices, to offset the bully beef. "Please". What? -You should say "please". Perfect timing for a lesson in manners. You know what? Please. Ziggy, Ziggy... Excuse me... Please, can you play a little bit more... happy? What do you say? Give the animal a break? I'm sorry for the rude word. What's... your real name? Haim. Finally, our army headed home but the King gave a clear-cut command... "I need a victory before the soldiers come home." The General appointed Naguib to command the task force. And so, I found myself again facing... Nitzanim. Iron Gate, Iron Gate, this is Sparrow. Do you copy? Over. Mira, what's going on? I'm trying, I'm trying. Iron Gate, this is Sparrow, do you copy? Over. Iron Gate? The radio's full of sand. I'll try to signal an SOS. Avraham, where are you going? I'm hearing something... Is the radio working? -I'm trying. Can't film like this. Can't live like this! Think they got the SOS? I don't know. I think I received an SOS.... It sounds garbled... -They sent an SOS, so there's no question, we have to send the reserves! Hold on... Are you sure you heard an SOS? I think so, not sure. "Think so" isn't good enough. Are you sure? Keep trying. Listen, we promised to send reinforcement. They're counting on it. -You listen. This is war... and at war you don't do what your enemy wants you to do, even if you must sacrifice. It's too early to talk about sacrifice, we don't know the situation. Keep trying to make contact. We're about 500 meters from the main gate. Over. We're on our way to the back gate. Over. Where are the reserve forces? They'll be here soon? Flip the machinegun. Avraham will turn them around. Now? -Yes. Remember the plan? We turn the tank towards us. Like we said, shoot only when needed, OK? Not yet, not yet... Aim at the turret of the tank, so they'll see where we're shooting from. Now! Fire! 300 meters from the back gate. Over. At the front gate. Over. We need to neutralize the Bazooka, over. Advance! Flip it back now! Now! It's lit. It has no impact! Retreat! Faster, faster! Get out! Habani... Habani, are you Ok? Habani, Habani... Ziggy, Ziggy... Ziggy, don't be afraid... Don't be afraid. Ziggy... Ziggy... Move in carefully. Mira, come on... Mira... Mira! Habani, move out. Habani, let's go. Check for their wounded in the bunkers. Proceed in three columns. Yerach! We have to get out of here. Naomi, it's Haim. Naomi, it's Haim, be quiet. Did you film it? -Yes. I need a new mag. Ben Gigi... Ben Gigi... Salman, eyes to the right. Salman! Salman! Don't give up... Stay with me... Salman... -When I shoot, you run, OK? What... Where..? Where's everybody? Where..? OK, we'll try to escape through the dunes... The Egyptians aren't barbarians. They'll tend to our wounded. But anyone who can still fight needs to get out. Get ready. Shoot only if shot at. I want prisoners. Over. Take positions. Romek... Hold on to me... My God... The reserves aren't coming? Go back. -What do you mean? Mira, I'll cover. Go! Go! Hadasa!!! -Leave her! She's gone! Hold your fire! This can't go on... This way we'll all die... What are you doing? This is useless. -What? What's useless? What are you going to do? -I... We can't let everyone die. We can't, it's just... It's irresponsible. Don't do that. I have to! I have to! Don't shoot! Please, don't shoot. We want to surrender. Please... No more shooting. Please... I want to talk. Look... Are you filming her? -Yes. Use a tight lens... Focus on her. Who's firing? -Ammo exploded in a burning tank. Cease fire! Nobody shoots. What for? I heard shooting, I thought... You acted without thinking. We're going inside. You and your men stay outside. Remain alert but don't do anything rash. I said I want prisoners. It seemed that the King got what he wanted. An ideal image of victory. "Our beloved King, His Majesty, King Faruk, "personally commanded our victorious forces. "Our army blew up the armed Zionist fort "and killed thousands of their soldiers. "Our courageous soldiers beat the enemy "under the brilliant guidance of our valiant beloved King." What a lie! They filmed the King in Cairo and cut him into the newsreel. After nearly a year, a prisoner exchange took place. Our soldiers who surrendered were treated disgracefully back home. The Israelis were equally contemptible, dubbing their fighters' surrender a betrayal. This attitude, on both sides, infuriated me. He who was not in that terrible war, shouldn't judge those young people who returned broken from the war. Years later, I asked a friend, a military historian, to find materials on Nitzanim for me. In a book he found for me, I noticed her photo. One phrase stuck with me, "No parting is more difficult than that of a mother from her child." Meaning, when writing it, she knew she wouldn't see him again. And that smile... as if telling death: "My friend, let's make a deal, "take my life and grant me eternal life", "grant me everlasting glory. In a story. In a legend. A deal with death. That's what she did. But I... would I be willing to give up my life and lose the ones I hold so dear for such a deal? Just for glory's sake? We're waiting for you... All of us. I'm not pushing... We just miss you. But we have patience. It doesn't have to happen today. Haste is from the devil. My love... Do you know why I'm very lucky? Why? Because you're wiser than me. -I know. Let's go eat. Stuffed artichoke? -Stuffed artichoke. You know, the whole time you've been stewing in here, the kids didn't want to disturb you. But they really missed you. I missed them too. But I couldn't... But now, at dinner, please don't talk politics. Politics is politics. But life is life.
