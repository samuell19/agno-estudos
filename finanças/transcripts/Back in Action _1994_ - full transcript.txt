Right on time. - Whatever happens, don't move. - It'll be cool. I'm just gonna sit here, and wait for my man to come back for me. If they're not here in five, we split. What are they waiting for? - Maybe they're as nervous as you are. - Don't tell me I'm nervous. I've been doing this thing before you learned how to jerk off. What's that? Ready? No, no. Wait a few minutes. Let's let 'em sweat a little, huh? They're playing games with us... Trick! Put that shit away! Signal them. If he doesn't answer, we're leaving. - We better do it, Frank. - You boys ready, back there? Yeah. Let's do it. - What were you waiting for? - I was doin' a count! - After all, I wouldn't wanna cheat you. - No, you sure wouldn't. Do you wanna get on with it? Okay. What the hell do you want? - Who's the stiff? - A friend. Where's the product? - It's all in there, man. - Well, you wanna show it to me? You go first. - No, you. - How long we keep dancin' like this? Yeah, well the fuckin' dance is over! Isn't this smart, huh? Now, we're gonna kill each other, and no one's gonna make no money. - What are you doing here? - What do you think I'm doing here? - Get out of your car! - Get the fuck away from me! - You're comin' with me, dammit. - Oh, fucking get off me! There it is. Take a look. Open it. Fuck you! You open it! All right. Fine. Do you wanna be dead? Hmm? Here's the chance of a lifetime, pal. - No! Get off me! - Don't even think about it! - Setup! - Billy! It's a fuckin' setup! Get to the car! Get to the fucking car! Go to the van, I'll cover you! Wallace! Wallace! Come on! Hey, wait up! Get out of the car, man! Get out of the fucking car! - Move it! - Get. Out. You are completely surrounded! Drop your weapons and put your hands over your head, now! I wanna see hands, I wanna see hands! He slaughtered him. Just so I could watch. Fucking bastards! They set us up! Kasajian, he's not gonna believe this! Oh, he'll believe this... I got their money... - Yeah, well, we lost the dope. - I got the dope. Great, we're in profit. Fuck the profit! I gotta get to a hospital! I'm not gonna make it! No! We're going to the boat! He could be dead! I gotta find out what happened to him. Now I don't really understand you. You coulda got your own self killed, back there. - Shut up, I ain't listenin' to you! - Well, you got to listen to me... I'm your brother. The only family you got. - It hurts me real bad... - Just quit your whinnin'... Somebody must've known it was goin' bad. Shut the hell up. Who coulda known it was goin' bad? - They're all dead, except us. - So where'd your woman get to? What the hell business is it of yours? She got away. How do you know? - She got away, I checked the car. - When? "When?" Before. What are you tryin' to get at? She left! Lucky she got out, man. What'd you want her to do? Jump in there and hit 'em with her purse? She shouldn't have been there in the first place. Fuck you, man! She was gone before it all started! No, she wasn't! You shut your goddamn lyin' mouth! You're right... Just get me a doctor. I'm not gonna make it. No kidding. I gotta see if he's alright! Forget about him. I'm sick of this shit! I'm sick of livin' like a rat in a hole! Well, when you get a job, we'll get a better apartment. I don't need no job! Well, what are you gonna do? Live off of the inheritance? No... I'm a live with Gantry. Over my dead body. See? You need to cut this shit out! I can do what I want! I love him, he loves me! He loves you? And what would that little prick know about love? - You don't know nothin' about him! - Well, what do I gotta know? He took you in the middle of some kind of drug deal! And what kinda man in his right mind would take you in a place like that? He didn't want to take me, anywhere! I wanted to be there! Killin' people with some low-life gangster? Well, then you're crazier than he is! Why should I listen to you? Your ass come out the Army: "Special Forces!" "Big Hero!" And now what ya doin'? Drivin' a cab... Big fuckin' deal! Turn it up! When we return, Live Eyes' Helen Lewinsky is on the scene, At Mt. Forest Cemetary, as police officers comb through the wreckage. Shit... Tara! Tara! Six hoods won. Stay tuned for Final scores at 11. Sensitive and vulnerable, as always. Touch the wrong button, you'd never work, again. Yeah, well, neither would you, Jimmy. Just after 4PM this afternoon, A team of police officers involved in an undercover drug buy were attacked. A police officer, and six suspects, were killed. You gonna be alright? - I'll see you, tomorrow, or Monday. - Right... Catch ya later, Jimmy... Frank! I'm really sorry about Wallace... How come it went bad? Look, there'll be a press conference, in the morning. You can ask them. C'mon, I'm just asking... No mic, no notepad, I signed off for the night? Helen, I've know you for five years; you've never signed off. That's been the problem. Yeah, well, I'd like to think we've both grown up a bit since then, Frank. Yeah, right... I don't know exactly what you're going through. I just wanna help, if I can. Yeah. Especially if there's a good story in it for ya, huh? Hey, that is not fair, Frank! I am just tryin' to do a hard job, the best way that I can. Just like you. No... No, it's not the same... You got a "hard day", your camera jams... Tonight, I'm gonna be sittin' in Wallace's livin' room... Lookin' at his wife's face... Watchin' her whole world cave in! There's a big difference, there, Helen! I'm sorry, Frank... Can I drive you back into town? Please? Mr. Kasajian will see you, now. Get up. When you first came to me, I saw... a special strength. - That's not always a good sign. - They had us set up. I know. Do you know what it is that makes a leader? Sacrifice. Sacrifice yourself, and men will follow you, anywhere. - Nobody knew. - Don't. Say. Anything. I just... wanted you to know. Later tonight, my men... will find... your lady friend, and kill her. - What are we doing here, Frank? - It's one of Kasajian's joints. Maybe we'll learn somethin'... Y'know, he never hated anyone... He found somethin' good even in the worst slimeballs you could imagine. It can make the job easier, sometimes. I don't know what he would do... You know, Frank, you're... welcome to stop by later, if you'd like. You sure that's a good idea? - What are you doin' here? - You don't know how to listen, do ya? Tara, go home. - Why don't you just beat it, buddy? - Why don't you shut up? - Get outta here. - Why don't you get outta here? No! Leave him alone! No! Stop it! They're my friends! Stop! I said they're my friends! Frank, aren't you going to do anything? Yeah... I'm havin' another drink... - Come on! - What are you doing? - You're comin' with me. - Are you crazy?! Whoa! Hold it, fella, I'm a cop. Hands against the railing, let's go. What? You figure you're faster than a speeding bullet? Tara, get out of here! I hate that karate shit... Now, you're under arrest for assaultin' an officer with that crap. Now, get your fat ass up, now! Alright, tough guy... You wanna fight, huh? Come on! Somebody call 9-1-1! Freeze! Huh?! - Get him! - Get down! Hands on the table! Mister... I'm a cop... I got a badge in my back pocket. The right side! He just came in here and started punchin' the place up! Sorry. Enjoy the paperwork. Billy! You alright? Friends of yours? Look at him! You look at him... Are these the people you hang out with? Kasajian's people? You tell me! - And now they wanna kill you? - I didn't do anything! You didn't do anything?! You're right in the middle of a shootout, a cop gets killed... Where's your boyfriend!? - I don't know! - He had to know about this! No, he wouldn't do that... Because he loves you? Right... He does love me... - Do you know who these jokers were? - Kasajian's mob. - Who was on the other side? - Hard to tell... Bit of a one-sided fight... - They ever say anything? - About what you'd expect, around here. Did he see or hear anything? No, I wish I could sleep as soundly as that. Can't say that I blame him, though. Cool... What happened, here? Well, my-my... Runnin' a little late, aren't we, Helen? Who lived here? A man and young lady, I think... You think? Yeah, I think. I don't think they're coming back. Looks like they've cleared everything out. No kidding...? So what do you think it all means? Y'know what I think...? I think it's two less scumbags in the street I gotta deal with. That's what I think. - Okay, thanks. Ya got that, Jimmy? - In close-up. Wait a second, whoa! Hang on, Helen! C'mon, now! You're not gonna use that on me, are ya? Well, I may have to, unless I get something better... Aw, c'mon, Helen... Reporters... Give me a second. Hang on. Jeez... A full-scale police investigation is underway to put an end to this senseless violence. That's great. I'm sure one of those quotes will work. Oh, you wouldn't do that to me, would ya, Helen? Aw, c'mon, Helen! Ah, you bitch... As far as I am concerned, I never saw you. And if I did see you... I didn't know you... If I knew you... you forced me to do it... Yes. But you... You can stay as long as you want. - You're one helluva friend... - Yeah... A lot of good has done that for me, being a "good friend"... - What am I supposed to do here? - Stay alive. - This is your fault! - What?! You grabbed me out the car! You wanted to stay there and get shot at? That's why they're after me, now! You don't get it... You're messin' with my life. You wanna take on the whole world, and be my big, bad brother... and now, you've made me a target! - Well, I didn't know. - Billy, they all think I snitched... It's your fault. And if that's not enough, I got the press breathin' down my neck! - I gotta take you off the case. - Aw, that's bullshit! Who else is gonna handle a case like this, huh? Any-body... Anybody who's not a walkin' time-bomb. Look! It was my sting, my responsiblity, and he was my partner! And the animal that did this to Wallace? He's mine, too. You don't give a damn, what you kick along the way... Look at you! Look... I screw up, you got my head on a platter. Until then, you give me a chance to do it. Come on. Hey, turn this up, will ya? I wanna hear this. Besides, I- I'm the only guy who seen the guy. Oh, no! Aw, you didn't talk to her, did ya? I didn't talk to nobody... Rossi! Get outta my way. We spoke with Metro Police Detective, Frank Rossi... A full-scale police investigation is underway to put an end to this senseless violence. That's a helluva job, Frank... That was the... dullest clip I've ever seen... They're never gonna have you on TV, again. Yeah, I got it under control. Really. He chewed up the men we sent. Guess you sent the wrong men. - What do you know about this man? - He's her brother. Some brother. Find them both. And kill them. - Hey, do you know where I can find Kasajian? - "Kasajian"? No. Nowhere. Okay, thank you. - I need to talk to Kasajian. - No way. Thanks, man... Hey, G. Kasajian has a hit out on my sister. Do you know where I can find him? - Nope. Sorry, Billy. - Thanks, man... - Do you know Gantry? - No. - Kasajian? - Uh-uh. What about you? - Look, just get the hell out. - You listen! I know Kasajian owns this hole. You tell him to take the hit of off my sister... - Or he's dead... You understand? - Get the hell outta here. - Who is it? - Uh, it- it's Frank. Just a minute, Frank. - Hi! - Hi! Hi. Whoof! Maybe I caught ya at a bad time, there...? No, I was just takin' a bath. Come on in! Frank, that is so sweet! Come in! Don't come any closer! Don't... What's this for? They sent me to kill you. Go ahead. Do it. - What's up, G? - What's up, man? Go round up the boys, do a number on our friend's head. Hey dudes, Chakka says check the brotha with the hood. You and me. You're all mine, man! Get that son of a bitch, now! Move it! Get goin'! Well, now... Isn't this special, huh? Well, go ahead, hot dog... Try that smart-ass kick again, huh? Shit! Oh, shit! You're comin' with me, man! C'mon, move your ass! Who the hell are you, anyway?! Move, move, move! Get in here, dammit! Hurry, hurry! C'mon! What the hell did you do to piss your friends off? Those aren't my friends! C'mon! Hey, watch out! Aw shit, man! Can't you drive a little faster? I got somethin' now, for youse... What are you doin'?! Are your crazy?! Brake! Brake! Brake! Brake-brake-brake! Man, brakes! Brakes! Brakes! B-Brakes! Shit! You're gonna tell me your deal with Kasajian's mob, now... Or you'll shoot me...? They got a hit out on my sister. You did a helluva a lotta damage there, mister. Just protectin' my home and family. Get out of the car, c'mon! - Here! - Damn! Do you know how to use one of these things? Ah, jeez... Cover me, man. Remarkable, how Detective Frank Rossi single-handedly held his own. Just what the Department needed on Prime Time, Rossi... Sorry, boss. I tried to get 'em to hold their fire until after the 11 o'clock news; but you know these kids, today. They got no damn respect! Somethin' I wanna show you... There! See that? He had ya dead... You were reloading... Your clip was out! Psh! There was one in the chamber, man! You sure there wasn't someone else there? Helpin' ya? Hey, come on, Lieutenant... How often does someone jump in to help a cop? Huh? And next on the 10:30 Report, we go to the streets for reactions from concerned- So, who was the guy with you at the rail yards? There wasn't anybody with me. At least nobody on my side... Oh yes, there was... - How come you didn't use this? - Actually, I hadn't seen it. I went over the outtakes, frame by frame, today. So, who is he? A vigilante? There's no such thing as a "vigilante"... Maybe... But I'll bet he's the same guy who took Kasajian's squad down in Kensington Market, yesterday... I think I've got one helluva story on my hands... "One Man..." "One Unstoppable Man against a whole Crime Syndicate!" Everybody loves a vigilante... Yeah, everybody except a cop. I can't keep this under wraps forever, Frank... If you won't tell me who he is, then at least tell my why he's doing it. Remember that girl in the bar, last night? The one the fight was over? Yeah? That's his sister. Kasajian, wants her dead. So now, Kasajian has got a war on his hands? Couldn't happen to a nicer fella, either. So, you happy? We're even, now, right? I'm gonna find that girl... Helen... What? You don't you think I can? Now, don't take this personal... But, stay the hell out of police murder investigations, will ya? The only thing you're gonna do is get yourself killed. And there's no Pulitzer Prize in the world that's gonna be able to bring you back. - Then work with me, Frank. - I can't... Why not? 'Cause I don't know how far I'm goin' on this one... Where are you going? I shoulda killed you when I had the chance... You could never kill me... You love me too much. - Oh yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Baby, we can't stay here, forever. - Then we'll go someplace else. - And they'll come looking for us... - For a while, then they'll give up... What about your brother? He's gonna go nuts... Kasajian! I want Tara back! You hear me?! Yeah? So? - Just a social call. - Yeah? We don't need none. "Gitano," huh? Right? "Jerry Gitano"... You can't come in. Now, you don't really mean that, do ya? What if I was to... tell your parole officer that, uh... you were workin' for Kasajian? You'd be back bendin' over for them big boys, for another three years, now. Wouldn't you, huh? Smoke... is death... Smoke... is... death... There... is... no... need... Smoke... is... death... I have... no need... Smoke... is... death.... Sm-oke... is... dea-th... I have... no need- ah! I have no need. What on earth do you think you're doing? What are you- ? Who the hell are you? I'm the apprentice. No. No-no. You. You're dead. C'mon, huh?! You wanna fight? C'mon! Get up! Get up! Get up, get up! Come on and fight me! Fight me! Fight me, tough guy, huh?! You wanna fight?! - Are you finished, yet? - I haven't even started. "You wanna be dead," huh?! Isn't that what ya said?! "You wanna be dead? Well, here's the chance of a lifetime." No! You're under arrest. You got the right to remain silent. Anything you say... can... and will be held against you in a court of law. On what grounds are you torturing me and my employees? On the grounds that this sub-human, murderin' scum... killed Officer Frank Wallace right in front of me. And I'm sure that the State Prosecutor will spell it out for ya, in much greater detail, in the mornin'. I doubt that you will have him, quite that long. If you'll excuse us... His name's Charles Bender, better known as "Chakka". Book him. Assault, murder... Anything ya want... I'm Mr. Bender's attorney, we'd appreciate the paperwork on this, as soon as you can manage it. Get outta my sight. There's no need there for that, Mr. Rossi. We all have a job to do, here. - I can see you've been doing yours. - "Job"?! You call what you do a "job"? Let me paint you a picture, mister... - Back off... - Yeah? "A Man"... no-no-no, "A Piece of Garbage"... "Takes a Knife... and Guts a Helpless... Police Officer..." Are you understandin' what I'm sayin' to you?! - You gotta prove that... - I saw it... Come on, Frank... He's not worth it. He'll be outta here, tomorrow. I guarantee it. You maggot... We could be next... Looks like Anthony turned... Our very own "Romeo"... Stupid prick. - I'm getting killed, here. - Hey! Shut up and draw. I want Tara back, you hear me? I want Tara back! - We don't have her! - Who are you?! - One of you will live, I don't care which one! - Who are you?! One of you will live! They're both dead. It's just me. Let me out. You tell Kasajian, I want my sister back. Yeah. - And he's next. - Right. Alright, bye. Somebody just trashed another of Kasajian's fronts. Wonder who that could be? Well did your office get the message from the police scanner? No. Cops probably don't even know, yet. Aw, that's terrific, huh? Maybe we should just close down shop and plug 9-1-1 into your beeper, huh? C'mon, let's go! You know, word on the street says you're next. But don't worry, Mr. Kasajian. I'm not worried. You... You should be worried. Find him. Find her. Kill them. - Hang on, whoa! What happened?! - He came to get the girl. - We didn't have her. - Who? - We didn't have her! - Get him outta here! Look, we don't even know if Kasajian's got the girl. Well, your vigilante - I mean, concerned citizen - thinks he does... Aw, shit... - I wanna find her before he does. - Never happen... I've got a hundred people with their grubby noses as close to the ground as they can get. If she breaks cover, somebody's gonna know. - Hey, girl! Can you spare a quarter? - Sure. - Here you go. - Ah, thanks a lot. - Good afternoon, Channel 3 News? - I got a message, for Ms. Helen. It's Skeeter! - He walked?! - Before you had your breakfast. He's a cop killer! What to do I gotta do?! Kill him with my bare hands, to get him off the street?! - Hope I'm not hearing you right... - He's out there, laughin' at us! You're off the case! For what?! Ya lost the drugs... Ya lost the money... I got a cop on my hands, everybody knows has a personal vendetta... - Do you know what that adds up to? - No, you tell me! You know, people are sayin' you know who's knockin' over Kasajian's soldiers... And lettin' him run... Now, I'm not saying that... But God help you, if I find out you've turned vigilante on me... Now, get out of here! Yes, sir! I think it's called, uh... Central Wrecking. - Right. You mean that junkyard on Paulson Street? - Paulson Street. Yeah, yeah. It's just a front, man. It's just a front for a chop shop. It has been, for years. Well, if you can dig up anything else Kasajian's got his paws into, I'd appreciate it. - Frank... - I know, I owe ya. - Yeah... - Okay, bye. Well, hi... Is this the only way you know how to say "hello"? Hey, well, you've become a very dangerous man. - Then why'd you shoot the other guys? - 'Cause I had to shoot somebody. It was a tough choice, buddy. What are you gonna do? What am I gonna do? I'm gonna take ya in, that's what I'm gonna do. Take me in? For what?! There's been a traffic jam down at the morgue, ever since you got involved in this damn thing! That's for what! Man, they got my sister, and they're gonna kill her! - So you gonna start a war...? - Yeah. What would you do? What if they had your sister? Your wife? You can't keep doin' this, man. I'm gonna walk away. Don't do that. Hey! Don't do that... Hey! Hey! Stop! I don't have a choice. You do. You can either let me find my sister... Or you can shoot me, right here... Hey, I got a job to do, buddy... I'm gonna do it... My sister saw Chakka kill your partner. What exactly are you tryin' to say to me? What I'm tryin' to say is: you don't wanna shoot me. Help me. We both on the same side... - You've got a message from Skeeter. - Thanks, Cliff. - 'Kay... - Alright... - Hey Joe, hold three minutes for me. - What do ya got? I can't explain now, but I'll be back for the 10:30. Trust me. We just wanted to be together, and then it all went crazy. They're all flippin'. We ain't goin' back to any of that. - What about your brother? - I'm worried about him. He loves me, but... I can let him know you're alright, if you want. Psh! And that'll be a great help... We're gonna start over, again. Just the two of us. Somewhere, where- No, Tara... I don't wanna know where you'd go from here. So, what are you gonna say about us, on TV? That you want to be together. To love each other, away from all of this madness. Maybe Billy'll understand. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Is it gonna be on, tonight? - Yeah. I'm gonna be on TV! I gotta tell ya, after all the trouble you caused... Kasajian's gonna use Tara to get to you, man. What if she's already dead? Look, most of Kasajian's businesses are drug fronts, operated by gang members... - What does this gotta do with my sister? - A lot. Tonight: Young Lovers Caught in the Crossfire. Every day, we discover more victims in this vicious gang war that is terrorizing our city. It's enough that you're dealing with a 6'11" Power Forward- Lenny, put that back on, please! In a small room, just moments ago, I spoke with a beautiful young woman. Very much in love. But also, very afraid. Aw, no... I cannot show you her face. And I cannot tell you where that small room is, - or they would be killed. - What's up, man? Shh, shh, shh... All they really want, is to be together- Yeah, this is Detective Frank Rossi. I want to talk to Helen Lewinsky, right now. - Who's Helen? - Shut up! I know she's on the air! Get her off, now! - Who's Helen? - Thanks a lot! We gotta go! Move! Goin' for a ride, lady... Come! Ah-ah... Get in! I'm a fan, you know. I've always been a fan. What do you want? Oh, uh... "The News Behind the News"? And you didn't tell us! You didn't tell us where Romeo and Juliet are! Tune in, tomorrow... Oh, God! Don't fuck with me, alright? You don't understand... You don't really believe... that I'm gonna break your arms... One... at a time... When you'll get to know me, a little better... You'll tell me. Ow, God! Oh... - Hey, hey, hey fellas? What're you doin'? - Where's Helen? I don't know... But she's not answering her pager... Now, gentlemen, I'm gonna have to ask ya to leave. You stupid bastard... Why'd you let her do that story, huh? Where'd she find the girl? I do not know. Helen didn't tell me. She wouldn't tell me. She never tells me, anything. - Who'd she get her tip from? - People phone in here, all the time... Maybe her messages! Who called? You do your "reporting" thing. You find out where they are; you tell 'em you've got money for them; I don't care what you gotta do, but you get over there and you call 'em, now. Now, please. For Christ's sakes, get on with it. We gotta get outta here. What do ya think? Oh, my God! No... - You killed him! - Shut up! - We didn't do anything! - Yes, you did. - No balls or brains, huh, Chakka? - Shut her up! Kasajian wants the war to stop! It's her brother you want, not her! - He's next. - No, he's not. You can't get him. He's beaten you all over town. My guess is if he keeps it up, you're a dead man. Shut the fuck up! You kill her, and you've got nothing to use against him. You're back to square one? Is that where you wanna be, Chakka? Oh, Kasajian will love that... Shut up! I'm tryin' to think... You got a nasty mind, lady. I'm right. We're all gonna go for a nice little boat ride... C'mon... South side, top floor. Gee, thanks... Back off, man! Billy! Billy, don't! - They took Tara away. - Where? To Kasajian... Grey freighter... At the spit... It's Helen's car. Jeez... the plank's up... You think we can get up there? If we don't, who will? Is that the best answer you can give me? C'mon! I don't want a six-shooter... I want automatic. Chrome. I look like Santy Claus to you, huh? Sheesh... Let's get outta here, man. Hey, man... You smell that? Yeah. It's ether. Why that son of a bitch... He's processin' his own drugs! C'mon! You got any ideas? Yeah. Let's go get 'em out. I'm not Roy Rogers... I'm not gonna shoot my way in and shoot my way out. We need a diversion. Come on, follow me. Shit! Something's wrong. - Huh? - Something's wrong. Well, you're the expert. Damn... I'll show ya tough for you! Woo-eee! You're gonna get it! Frank? Frank? - Frank... - Helen... Welcome aboard, Frank. I'll take care of the guests, Mr. Kasajian. Haven't you already taken your best shot? Well, actually, I haven't even started. You son of a bitch! I'll kill you! No-no-no-no-no... This is really most refreshing. I think I'm gonna enjoy this. Gentlemen, have fun... Mr. Gitano and I will be entertaining the ladies... below... Don't forget to clean up after you. And throw out the trash. I'll kill you, you son of a bitch! Yes, sir. You're mine, now! - How's your memory? - It's a little fuzzy... Let me refresh it. Remember this?! You son of a bitch! Nice try. In the right hands, these little needles, can cause exquisite pain. I remember this, too... Take him outside, boys... Take him for a swim. What do you want to know? - Nothing. - Leave her alone! No! Thanks for comin' out, Frank. Kiss my ass! Go! Go! Up there! C'mon. Come on and fight! Come on! What?! "Wanna be dead?!" Huh?! "Wanna be dead?" Isn't that what you said? "Here's a chance of a lifetime..." You can't kill me, pig. You gotta read me my rights. You got the right to remain silent... Forever. Billy?! Don't... move... Come out, or I'll kill her! Could this be your brother? Your very costly, rampaging brother? Let her go, Kasajian. It's not her you want. It's me. Throw the gun away! Let her go. Throw it away! Let her go. Thank God. Frank... Oh, God... Oh... Frank?! Frank?! Helen? Helen... Oh, God, Frank... Oh, Frank... What are you going to do about all this mess? I think I'm gonna blame it on you. All by myself? It's a helluva job, huh? "One Man..." "One Unstoppable Man, Takes on a whole Crime Syndicate, by Himself..." "He Comes in the Night, Destroys, and then, Disappears..." "...and Disappears!" Thank you. Let's get outta here, man. Slow, though... Slow... Okay. Ow! - Channel 3 will be here, soon. - No! - Oh, come on! One comment! - No! None!
