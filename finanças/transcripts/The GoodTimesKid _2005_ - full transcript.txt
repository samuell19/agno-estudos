Oh, my life depends on that 1 feel as if I'm a bird trapped inside a gold bird cage I fear his anger will turn into fury and hate Oh, nobody knows that better than myself and I have dealt with it in unsuspecting ways ways that have even surprised myself You're mind is surely twisted such a paradox Many times unappreciated Not any more When should we leave? Now When I first When I first saw her... I thought she was Eskimo or something Something I hadn't seen before So I started hunting for her Trying to find out where she was or where she was going Two months later I finally get to run into her again Not so by accident And then I see her and I just kinda freeze So... I'm gonna chicken out when she comes up and is like: "can I kiss you?" She's like that, y'know? I mean, obviously you know She's one of those people that actually... do what they say is honest won't lie to you Doesn't cheat She's stubborn though makes up her mind a lot, way before she... knows everything I guess everybody does it, but... she pushes, shoves in bed she throws punches at night sometimes you'll wake up and you'll be holding to the edge of the bed just so you don't fall off She's strong she's definitely definitely one of a kind She's just... she's rare It's the way it goes the way it goes It's...the...way it goes Just the way it goes the way it goes I fucked up... I really really fucked up I fucked... Hey man, I wanna show you something Oh, that's awesome, man... the best songs can survive anything So, what are you going to show me? Rodolfo Cano?
