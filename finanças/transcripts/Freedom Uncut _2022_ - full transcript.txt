On Christmas Day, 2016, we heard with shock and disbelief... that our dear friend, George Michael, had passed away. Only days before, he was putting the finishing touches to the film you're about to see. This is George's film, Freedom, and it's his final work. ♪ Looking for some education ♪ Make my way into the night ♪ All that bullshit Conversation ♪ Baby, can't you read The signs ♪ I won't bore you With the details, baby ♪ I don't even wanna waste Your time ♪ Let's just say that maybe ♪ You could help me Ease my mind ♪ I ain't Mr. Right ♪ But if you're looking for ♪ Fast love ♪ If that's love In your eyes ♪ It's more than enough ♪ Had some bad love ♪ So, fast love is all that I've got ♪ On my mind ♪ ♪ I can give you All the loving That your heart ♪ I can give you All the loving That your heart ♪ I can give you All the loving That your heart ♪ Desires ♪ In 1988, George Michael became the biggest selling artist in the world. This is the story of just how fame and tragedy intervened to change his life forever. I was massively unhappy and lonely. I remember standing there with a tear in my eye, thinking, "I really don't know if I'll ever do this again." And it changed everything from that day to this. I was single, I hadn't come out. If I could have the self-awareness and the strength to walk away, I could change my life. I felt that stepping back would save me from somehow screwing up my career. Uh... Yeah, waiting please. We got them. I first became aware of George Michael's music when I was hardly like... I was definitely a little girl. I think his music was really... It's just there in your psyche. I just think it's not even taken for granted. It's just there in the ether. ♪ There ain't no point In moving on ♪ 'Till you've got somewhere To go ♪ And the road that I have Walked upon ♪ Well, it filled my pockets ♪ And emptied out my soul ♪ He's got a voice like an angel.

But the central belief that my musical journey would be of my own making has been the thing that's informed almost every decision I've ever made in terms of my career. I have a musical ability which was... powered as a young, as a teenager, it was powered by this desperate ambition to be famous and to be loved and respected, whatever. And all I wanted at that time was success. ♪ I'm sorry If I smoked your plan ♪ I had no master plan, I didn't know if I was gonna be a singer or anything. But, at school, I met Andrew, and we formed this Ska band called The Executive, and we were terrible basically. But Andrew and I had already developed a knack for writing these catchy little songs, and we got together a couple of tracks. One was called "Careless Whisper" and one was called "Wham Rap!" ♪ You got soul on the dole? ♪ You're gonna have a good time Down on the line ♪ The '80s was probably one of the most depressing, sort of, demoralizing times that we've ever had for young people in British history, because the recession, because of everything, because of mass unemployment. So, I think music, then, was probably really, really important. In terrible depression, you have the people that come out and say, "This is terrible.

You know, I was walking down the street like... "Watch TV last night?" And I think it took about three days before someone came up and asked me for my autograph, and I was absolutely shattered that it took that long. ♪ A married man You're out of your head ♪ Sleepless nights On an H.P. bed ♪ A daddy by the time You're 21 ♪ If you're happy with a nappy Then you're in for fun - It wasn't all sugary. - He was singing about being on the dole and having kids. And, you know, there was a bit of social commentary there, and he was embracing this newfangled thing called rap, you know, dressed like someone from West Side Story. We should have known then. Then, "Club Tropicana" taught us, "Don't worry, you can sun tan." He predicted global warming way before its time. ♪ Club Tropicana Drinks are free I mean, I can't get the little white shorts out of my head. ♪ Call me good ♪ Call me bad ♪ Call me anything You want... ♪ I'll be very honest. I was a Culture Club fan. And we used to throw eggs at the Wham! fans. They were massive, weren't they? George Michael, and it was like... They were just fucking everywhere, weren't they? ♪ Baby, I'm your man ♪ Anyone of my generation, you really can't remember the first time you heard about George Michael if you grew up in the UK because he's just part of the fabric of it. So, there is a time of one which was like a lot of fun. I was going to club like... etcetera. And we'd have a lot of fun and we loved it. It was truly representing the time, you know? ♪ Oh yeah ♪ I'm sure I could, me older brother... I'm sure he had a bit of a Wham! moment, you know what I mean? ♪ Somebody told me ♪ Boy, everything she wants Is everything she sees ♪ And I already felt I was too old to like them. I felt a bit ashamed that I was liking this teen band, but they were great. They had something else. They had a lot more. ♪ And now you tell me that You're having my baby ♪ I'll tell you that I'm happy If you want me to ♪ But one step further... ♪ Wham! itself was an absolute joy. It was as joyous as it sounded. They say youth is wasted on the young. My God, what a wonderful joyride for two 18-year-olds. ♪ Wake me up before you go-go ♪ There was a humor about Wham! that no one ever gave us credit for. We were so taking the piss out of ourselves half the time. How can the country be in love with these two idiots? I knew how to make these records and how to make them jump out of the radio. And the idea that just because I was wearing ridiculous shorts and curtain rings in my ears would actually stop people from noticing that. When I look back, I still think it's kind of stunning. I mean, everything happened kind of incrementally for us. But there was never a point where I thought, "My God, I'm more famous than I expected to be," because I was so busy thinking about trying to get to the next level. But, I always believed, deep down, that once I had my foot in the door, no one was gonna get me out. ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ I'm like a maniac At the end of the day ♪ I'm like a doggie Barking at your door... ♪ It's so hard to remember the day of the final, because it went so perfectly. It was like a dream, really. I know that there was this overwhelming feeling of pride, and also a horrible awareness that meant a kind of end for Andrew and I. But on that final day, I remember us hugging each other and knowing that there was something incredibly sad going on at the same time that we were celebrating, you know. By the end of it, I had no doubt that I could become an international solo success. And as though there's always been this red line, I see it like a red line which goes through everything. Like a staircase to whatever you're about to do next. And I could feel that at the final concert. I already had one foot in my solo career. Okay. We want more! We want more! That's enough of that. I'm not ever going to be a fan of a boy band, right? It's not going to happen. When he went solo, the whole thing went up ten notches. ♪ Time can never mend ♪ The careless whispers Of a good friend ♪ I think he was the first one that was definitely an obvious teen band to then go on to be a serious singer, songwriter and take over the world. ♪ There's things that you guess And things that you know ♪ It's still very rare for an act like that to go to America. The '80s just spawned this handful of massive celebrities that were constantly battling the charts. ♪ That's all I wanted ♪ Something special, Something sacred ♪ In your eyes ♪ For just one moment... ♪ There was really, Prince, Madonna, Jackson, and myself. And I just didn't feel who I was, was bright enough, or kind of vivid enough to compete, because they were different people. They seemed to be much more larger than life. If I was looking for happiness, this was the wrong road. But I don't think there's any way I could have controlled my ego enough to have stopped me exploring the possibility of being the biggest selling artist in the world. So, I went with full gusto into creating a new character. You know, one that I thought would be resilient enough to stand up there next to Madonna and Jackson and Prince. Ladies and gentlemen, George Michael. And I guess I did that pretty effectively, alongside what was a very, very commercial record. ♪ Well, I guess It would be nice ♪ If I could touch your body ♪ I know not everybody Has got a body like you ♪ The attitude, he was creating, like, a personage as we call it, you know. He was very charismatic. Every video was a very strong impact. ♪ Oh, but I need some time off From that... ♪ He is, like, coming in jeans, you know, and like tight and sexy. And like a rock image and moving with the hips like that. You know, a little like Wham! before, you know. A little like that, but more, like, sexy. Check this out then, modern day Elvis. ♪ Faith, I gotta have... ♪ I liked the spirit of "Faith", because you do have to have it. I remember his "Baby, ow!" ♪ Baby ♪ Yeah, I remember that. I didn't realize that people would look at the "Faith" image and go, "Fuck, that's cool." ♪ I'm givin' you the blues ♪ I was really, really overwhelmed by the size of things, I suppose. I lived in fucking sunglasses. I couldn't make eye contact with people. It was bizarre. ♪ And another who tied me Down to loverboy rules ♪ I still suffered terribly with insecurity about my looks. It goes back to a family background where conceit of any kind was considered an absolute sin. So, no one was ever praised about the way they looked. ♪ Well, I need someone To hold me ♪ But I'll wait For somethin' more ♪ Yes, I gotta have faith ♪ "Faith" was number one in Britain for one week. But in America, number one for 12 weeks. And then on top of that, he had four number one singles, a number two single and a number five single. In 1988, he was the biggest pop star in the world. ♪ Because I gotta have faith Faith, faith ♪ I gotta have faith, Faith, faith ♪ All I remember is "Faith" being played 50 times a day on MTV. You had to be in heavy rotation on whatever pop station you were on. Duran Duran, David Bowie, Eurythmics was played on MTV, like, constantly, played on all the video stations. You really didn't hear any of those artists, but you heard George Michael, on some of the urban stations, right after Luther Vandross. His music broke through to everybody. In America, radio play for me was substantial on a lot of R&B stations. He uniquely achieved recognition on the R&B soul charts that very few white performers ever got. He obviously had studied American soul music, and felt a connection and a kindred spirit. We were introduced to each other, so, we're going back now to about '86 maybe. And it was his thought that he wanted to do a duet with one of my artists. ♪ Like a warrior that fights ♪ And wins the battle ♪ When I was about six or seven, I had a wind-up gramophone that my mum gave me. I had two Supreme singles, one wasStop! In the Name of Love and one wasBaby Love. And I hadDelilah by Tom Jones, which is funny, because I kind of ended up somewhere between the Supremes and Tom Jones when you think about it. ♪ I know you did Kept my faith ♪ When the river was deep ♪ I didn't falter ♪ When the mountain was high ♪ I still believed ♪ When the valley was low ♪ It didn't stop me ♪ It didn't stop me ♪ No ♪ I knew you were waiting ♪ Some place♪ Somewhere ♪ Somehow♪ For me ♪ It was great that I had my own voice and I had worked with Aretha Franklin, and everything had gone so well. From an artistic point of view, it just got better and better. George Michael's voice, to me, was always very soulful, and it was very warm, and sultry and urgent. He has soul. Period. Soul is an expression of the soul, of the heart. It was good to be number one in the black charts. It was an amazing thing to see, obviously. England has a great love affair with American black music and R&B and a great tradition of our own interpretation of soul music and that thing, but he's... He's kind of up there, at the pinnacle of it. ♪ But remember this Every other kiss ♪ That you ever give Long as we both live ♪ When you need the hand Of another man ♪ One you really can Surrender with ♪ I will wait for you Like I always do ♪ There's something there That can't compare ♪ With any other ♪ Making that album, I'm sure I was incredibly proud of it, but I don't think I ever imagined it would be bigger than Wham! I imagine that the pressure on someone like George must have been insane, because he was doing stuff that was just so phenomenal. After you have that kind of success, like, what do you go home at night and go, "Now, what do I do?" I do remember it being shocking to me that I could become more successful than I had been with Wham! I suppose the whole exercise was an effort to raise my profile to kind of define what my solo image was going to be. But I really had no idea how effective it was going to be, especially in America. And I had no idea what it was like to be that big in America. George is really, really private and I think, when he was young, with all that fame, I just think it came too fast, and it wasn't actually what he was expecting. I was probably most out of control, in any kind of sense of that, during the whole "Faith" thing. Being caught in the eye of this storm is catastrophic. It's just 24/7 full time in your face. I mean, the wind burn is terrible. I can't really explain how overwhelming that kind of hysteria can be if there's only one person to absorb it. When I was with Andrew, it was so easy to keep one foot in my old life, the life that I had known with him before we'd been famous. It was so easy to keep each other grounded, to take the piss out of each other, and be able to look at each other and talk about the madness that was going on around us. But when you can't do that, suddenly, it is scary. I don't know many 24-year-olds who would not have, at least subconsciously, found that frightening enough to self-destruct. Now the problem is, the record came out everywhere in the world, pretty much at the same time. So, everybody wanted a piece of George to help promote the album. Enormous pressure. Huge, huge pressure. Ten months of that was enough to really push me to the edge. And I was terribly lonely, you know? Me and my red line were very lonely. And the only good part of my day was playing live. When I sang "Careless Whisper"... I can't remember which was the last gig on the American tour, which would have been the end of the whole tour. I think it was Pensacola. But when I sang "Careless Whisper" that night, I remember standing there, with a tear in my eye, thinking, "I really don't know if I'll ever do this again." ♪ Time can never mend ♪ The careless whispers ♪ Of a good friend ♪ To the heart and mind ♪ Ignorance is kind ♪ There's no comfort In the truth ♪ Pain is all ♪ I was intelligent enough to know I should not be trying to catch up with Michael Jackson or Madonna or whatever, which was absolutely what I was intent on doing. I felt that tired and exhausted at being the center of that much attention. I suppose the way my lack of mental balance showed itself was that I actually really began to hide away when I got home. And I did almost nothing for a year, but try and reestablish some idea of the real life. Music was my very controlling lover. I had millions of lovers that I never saw other than in the sense of live work. But I still deserved one. Just one of them for me. And I knew that the only way I was gonna find that one person, that lover, was to jump off of the merry-go-round just for long enough to catch my breath, and letting my heart rule my head, rather than, you know, the red line. The red line that goes up, up, up, up, up, up. Sometimes you feel like he's... He's got, like, a layer or two of skin missing. Like he just, like he bruises easier, and because of that, he can write these amazing songs. I never wanted to be someone else. I wanted to be a star, and I wanted people to love me and recognize me in the street. As a child, that's what I wanted, but I never really wanted to be someone else. I believe I am a writer much more than I am anything else. And I want to leave songs. I believe I can leave songs that will be, will mean something to other generations. This award is for favorite soul and R&B album. And the winner is, George Michael. George Michael. I've been a lover of soul music since I was a kid. And I'd just like to thank everybody who has helped me this year. I'd like to thank Black Radio, I'd like to thank everyone at CBS Records, in the R&B department. And I'd like to thank everyone who voted for me. I can't believe it. Thank you very much. I won these two awards that were traditionally received by black artists. And I think there was a perception that it had gone too far. The black male artist works very hard to get his due, and Bobby Brown had across the board play. And he could compete in the same category as George Michael competes in. That would be a whole another thing. I didn't ask to be given those awards, I'm not going to pretend I wasn't happy to get them. But I do understand what the argument that says, "This guy is just an acceptable version of black music for White America." Suddenly, crossover was not hip. And I see that point. I totally saw the point at the time. I just felt it was sad, you know, that white and black people recording together, suddenly was, kind of, dancing with the enemy. You mean George is white? Are you serious? Oh, my God! And he is blind, right? I think it had a huge effect on George, because he'd won in this category, he'd achieved something that was beyond his wildest dreams, only to have the carpet pulled from under his feet. I don't think there's any attempt to, kind of, steal black heritage in what I'm doing. All I think that's happening is I'm trying to make good music. Music is not based on the color of one's skin, or, you know, this is soul music or this is pop. To me, those things are like, it's kind of old. You know what I mean? I suddenly couldn't get anywhere near radio, Black Radio. And that was the reason, really, Listen Without Prejudice was called Listen Without Prejudice. It was me saying, "Here's an album that has bits of gospel, you know, bits of R&B, some very white stuff," and it was just trying to say, "Let me be both of these things "without having to be one or the other." I don't know if I bought it, stole it, or it just, sort of like, just got delivered. You know, I mean, sometimes you get albums like that, don't you? You know what I mean? They're that great, they just end up in your house. What can I say about the sound of it? It's very ethereal. It has a mystery about it. George, on this album, got everything that he had inside his gut, onto vinyl or CD or cassette. And thank God he did. Well, let's have a party pop song. It fucking won. This song, now, it's just got such a big opening, a message, actually, I think. That opening, it reminds me of John Lennon. Sliced out of one of John's solo albums. ♪ These are the days Of the open hand ♪ They will not be the last ♪ Look around now ♪ These are the days Of the beggars And the choosers ♪ When I listen to George Michael's songs, I think, not only he's tapped into his dark side of whatever's going on in his life, but he's tapped into the truth about who he is and what he is, and what life is. And he wasn't afraid to share that with us. ♪ The rich declare Themselves poor ♪ And most of us Are not sure ♪ If we have too much But we'll take our chances ♪ 'Cause God's stopped Keeping score ♪ When I hear that, it is right up there, you know what I mean? And then you get into the lyrics. The ones from the side is "The rich declare themselves poor." I like it, 'cause it's got a bit of a dig. You know what I mean? I mean, that's the way I take it anyway. It's like, "You bunch of fucking cunts," you know, "always fucking playing the poverty card." I like that, 'cause it's got a bit of Lennon vibe.

There comes a point where you have to write something which you haven't written before, and which your interest in any particular topic or subject will inspire you, and that's why, I suppose, eventually, most lyricists, do approach wider topics than sex and love, you know? ♪ These are the days Of the empty hand ♪ Oh, you hold on To what you can ♪ And charity is a coat You wear twice a year ♪ "Charity's a coat you wear twice a year."

That was probably my introduction even to Stevie Wonder. The version "They won't Go When I Go", it brings back a lot of the memories because it's the thought that at the end of the day, we come alone in this world, and we will, and we will die alone. And it's what we do in between that's going to determine how and what we'll be remembered as and what we can think about in spirit.

So, you know, it takes a massive amount of bravery for George to do a song like that.

I'd much rather be taking my dog for a walk. Or, you know, be with friends. I feel like I don't belong out there. Being this professional person, going around selling his wares. He had a much harder journey than me in a way, because if you get fame and accolades and wealth beyond your wildest dreams as a teenager, it usually goes wrong. But he obviously had a wiser head on his shoulders than most. I think a lot of young musicians now are kind of, you know, sort of, manufactured. And I think, for him, he didn't ever want to be like that. And part of his reactionary way was to break away from all of that. I was still struggling with the idea of having that much attention. And I think, like, recoiled from that and I felt that stepping back would save me from somehow screwing up my career. I see, kind of, hard sell promotion as prostituting myself. I can't help it, even if it's a complete fallacy. That's how I see it. I am of that generation. He felt he needed to withdraw from the merry-go-round that is promoting and albums and explained in a very articulate way. That he just felt he had to withdraw from that for the moment, for his own sanity, that we would probably get more albums out of him if we just allowed him to back off. That was quite a bomb shell, I suppose, for us to have to deal with. The fact that he didn't do any promotion of it, it's begs, you know, it's quite astonishing.

It was, like, "He wants you five." "And it has to be all of you five." ♪ Sometimes the clothes Do not make the man ♪ Now in fashion, there is no supermodels like this. This is gone. It was like the magic moment of modeling. I suppose that's the lasting memory of that whole video shoot was the cost of the girls and the fees they were charging on a daily basis. That was pretty groundbreaking. George pitched it to me in L.A. and his exact words were... "You're the leader of the gang, and unless you say yes, the rest of the girls won't." His people talked to my people. Yeah, you know how it went back then.

I was freezing cold. I was covered in glycerin to make my skin shiny. And I, kind of, thought, "I hope Fincher knows what he's doing." I remember David and George working closely together.

When I spoke to theLos Angeles Times about stepping back from promotion, Frank Sinatra wrote me an open letter that just said, you know, "Get over it." "Be glad that God gave you a gift and get out there and use it." I don't think he wrote the letter. I actually believed that was the work of a publicist, not the work of a genius. What a wonderful letter. Here, probably, the greatest male singer of all time is saying, "Embrace your talent, enjoy the success. Don't be threatened by it." Now, even though he's the greatest singer that ever walked the planet, as far as I'm concerned, I wasn't taking any advice from Frank Sinatra. You can't put a gun to any creative person's head and say, "Create, write, promote, market, whatever." You just have to go with it. That's what we had to do. I had spent six or seven years of my life, working, working, working, writing, music, music, music. And then I had this desire to escape. The basis for me going to do the shows in Rio was I wanted to see Brazil. And I think I made it conditional that 30 of my friends would be flown out to Brazil. We had our own private island. Absolutely beautiful. I'm actually wearing today... Some sweat pants. They're very tight at the bottoms.

It was, kind of, immediate. Everybody, with the exception of my family, was introduced to him very, very quickly because I felt immediately that everything had changed. All our friends knew, of course. I remember seeing him and just thinking how I just was feeling so happy for him. The two of them met and changed George's life. It's very hard to be proud of your own sexuality when it hasn't brought you any joy. Once it is associated with joy and love, it's easy to be proud of who you are. The first time you actually believe somebody loves you, that's a wonderful moment in your life, and it was a wonderful six months. What a poser. He was just very full of energy, very loving. I was happier than I'd ever been in my entire life. He didn't care who saw him with Anselmo. He'd found something. He'd found what he was looking for, you know? By the time I met Anselmo, I had made the decision to jump off the merry-go-round, and I was already in the early stages of my confrontation with Sony. Recording an album, and then saying, "I'm not going to promote it or I'm not going to market it. I'm not going to participate," that's a serious detriment to an album. I think we had some personality issues between people in the UK and people in the American company. Why wasn't this "Faith Part Two"? We wanted all those nice pop songs. What do you mean he's not going to promote? We're not going to have his image on it? It's like saying, "I'll do a movie but I..." I won't do one premiere. "I won't do any interviews for the movie." You know, you say, "Oh, my God." The moment someone says to a musician or to an artist, make more of them or do more of that, it kills you. And I think probably for someone like George, especially, at certain times in his career, he must've felt quite trapped. In England, they made an effort, and Listen Without Prejudice outsold Faith. And lots of places it outsold Faith, because I think it was actually a better album. But it wasn't about that. It was about the total and utter lack of respect that the minute somebody doesn't see themselves as a commodity, that they have the audacity to think, "My God, I am actually creating something and I must keep myself sane in order to do that." The minute somebody does that, they're over. We tried very, very hard to get the American executives to come over and listen to why George felt the way that he did from George, 'cause there was no-one better to put that forward than George Michael telling them, as he had told us. The reasons how he really felt deep down. But they wouldn't come. There were executives that came to London in 1989 and we played them the record. I explained to them that Faith had taken me to the edge of madness, that I wanted to be a long-term player in this business. Now, any logical CEO, I think, would have thought, "Okay, he's gonna do this. He'll get it out of his system and he'll get back on board." George is very stubborn. He's incredibly one of the most stubborn people I've ever met. But he was right to be stubborn on this occasion, and I'm sure the record company recoiled in horror. It was very much a clash of cultures, really. In America, there was definitely a door that shut. ♪ But losing everything ♪ Is like the sun going down On me ♪ Mr. Elton John!

I think George definitely should wear this. ♪ If that's all right, yeah ♪ So, I realized at that point that if a number one around the world was not going to reinstate any kind of relationship with Sony, then nothing was. I don't want to pick a fight. I just wanted to work with people who wanted to work with me and who would have some respect for the fact that I was growing up. It was deeply, deeply troubling times, because you could see this, it's like trying to watch a train wreck in slow motion. There is nothing you could do to stop it. Anselmo and I were in LA when he was advised to go for his test. He hadn't been tested for a while and he was absolutely healthy looking, more than healthy looking, when I first met him. Within a month or two of meeting him, he had a flu that he couldn't get rid of, and some red marks that came up on his chest. And I remember the kind of terror of... me understanding that this was possibly the beginning of, you know, an illness. I remember him leaving the house and... To this day, I remember looking at the sky and saying, "Don't you dare do this to me." I mean, I was 20... 27 going on 28. But at that point in time, you think, like, that's a lifetime to have waited to be loved. Anselmo had the test in Brazil. I went home to my family for Christmas and sat at the Christmas table not knowing whether my partner, whom the people sitting around the table did not know about, not knowing whether this man I was in love with was terminally ill. And, therefore, not knowing whether I potentially was terminally ill. That Christmas was probably the darkest, darkest, most frightening time in my life. I remember my publicist calling me to tell me that Freddie Mercury had died. And he died of HIV obviously. And I remember I was... I was crying and I actually just thought... I mean, bless him, I was really sad that Freddie had passed away. But, of course, I was crying about something else entirely, which was the fact that both my partner and possibly myself were HIV. It was an incredibly difficult period for George, because it was something that he had to hold close to his chest. I was just absolutely devastated to find out that he had a terminal illness. I was just devastated. Even by the time Freddie's tribute had been put together, I was still sworn to secrecy. I just wanted perfection. Which is what I always wanted. So, I went for five days to rehearse. Everyone else went for an afternoon. I went for five days. Because it had to be perfect. Because I had to take all those years of standing in a bedroom, with I don't think I had a hairbrush, but I would stand and sing to the mirror. And that child was going to take all that knowledge all that subconscious easing in of music from that group and sing one of Freddie Mercury's songs to the world after his passing in front of my lover. In my subconscious view, this was, very probably the most important performance of my life. ♪ Somebody to love ♪ He works hard ♪ Everyday♪ Everyday ♪ I try and I try and I try ♪ But everybody wants To put me down ♪ They say I'm goin' crazy ♪ They say I got a lot Of water in my brain ♪ I got no common sense ♪ He's got Nobody left to believe ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I was so overwhelmed by the sadness of singing the songs of this man that I absolutely worshipped as a child, who had passed away in the same manner that my first live-in partner was going to experience.

I saw it as, if I'm going to do nothing but love this man and care for this man, if I could do nothing beneficial as a musician because I cannot even think of a note, maybe I have a chance to do something truly special and change the standard record contract forever. I didn't think that it would end up in court, at the time because I really thought that sanity will prevail. Well, I was wrong. It didn't. Our relationship broke down because they said, "No, you are this kind of artist." This is the kind of artist that we sell. This is the kind of artist we know how to sell. And if you don't want to sell yourself that way, and you want to go off on this journey "and find this other audience, we're not gonna support you." The relationship had completely disintegrated. George flew out to New York with his publisher and basically, it was at that meeting that George told the head people at Sony that he'd wanted out of the deal, wanted a divorce. What he was basically saying is, "How can I stay with a company... "who won't support me in any way when I feel so strongly?" We issued a writ three days later. I will never know if Sony and I would have ended up in court had Anselmo not become ill. I was absolutely terrified of losing him and the prospect of watching him die of AIDS. I was in LA and the phone rang, and I was told that Anselmo's best friend in Brazil was on the phone. And... then it all goes blurry for a long time. He still, 23 years later, brings a tear to my eye. He was... He was my savior. It's still very hard for me to explain how finding a companion at that stage in my life changed me. And such a beautiful companion, such an amazing person. I think, to some degree, the Sony court case was a perfectly good place to put my anger. I used to go and run on the treadmill everyday and play squash and do everything I could to get rid of all of this anger and fear. But the best place for it was court number one, really. George, come on, George. There was the part of my personality that could say, "Okay, fuck this!" This can't all be bad. I've got to do something good with this time in my life "and change the path of artists' lives." One of Britain's most successful pop singers, George Michael, is today asking a High Court judge to declare his recording contract null and void. He says the contract with Sony Music is too restrictive and that the company takes too much of the profits. The deal that I was working from was based upon the original deal which I had signed with Andrew, under duress. And it recorded a demo of "Careless Whisper", "Club Tropicana", "Wham Rap". The head of the record company of Innervison turns up with these contracts and we went to this greasy spoon cafe. And he said "Look, if you don't sign this now, the deal is going away." "You won't have finished demos to take away, you won't own them." And we were on our own, we had nobody with us, and we signed them. When you start a career with a ridiculous contract "where someone is paying you nothing on 12" records, one and a half per cent on the records that you do sell, when you start from that point, you know from that day on not to trust the industry. This was a worldwide, major artist saying to a record company that the basic contract which record companies used was invalid. If you really fall out with the people who control your professional life, you have a right to walk away. I think that is the right of every individual. And the music industry takes away that right from every artist it signs. George is very, very brave. He's not afraid of anybody. And he thought he was being wronged and he went out and fought his own corner. What we couldn't do was stand up and say, "Yeah, you're right." "These contracts are slavery and they shouldn't be allowed, Your Honor." We weren't going to do that! You would have artist after artist queuing up to take their record company into court. I can't think of one artist that supported me. Not one. I know of a lot of artists who sat back and waited for the result. But that's a different thing. Artists like George Michael come along, if you're lucky, once-in-a-lifetime. My feelings as the court case went on were that we'd lost him. How could you ever patch that up? I'd never let on to George of the problems until after he'd been in the witness box. And I said, "It's not going well." And, you know, you shouldn't raise your hopes at this stage. The pop star George Michael loses his High Court battle to break away from his record company, Sony. In dismissing the claim, the judge, Mr. Justice Parker, ruled that the contract was both reasonable and fair. The 30-year-old singer had argued that the agreement was stifling his artistic development and he threatened never to record for Sony again if he lost. George Michael says he'll appeal against the judgment, which he said condemned him to "professional slavery." Having received this judgment, I would like to reiterate the reasons why I embarked upon these proceedings. I have no right to resign. In fact, there is no such thing as resignation for an artist in the music industry. Effectively, you sign a piece of paper at the beginning of your career and you are expected to live with that decision, good or bad, for the rest of your professional life. I shall obviously take full advice from my lawyers. But the initial view is that we have very strong grounds for appeal and we hope to have the appeal heard as quickly as possible. Thank you very much for your time and for all the support that I've received since this action began. Thank you. George, will you sing for Sony again? After the court case was finished and I'd lost and not just lost, I lost completely. I mean, I lost on everything. Every count. They then called up and, you know, kind of said, "Well, isn't... Can't we patch things up?" kind of thing. But I knew in reality that was like a formality. They had to do that. But ultimately, the whole thing was a complete waste of time. And I regret it to this day. Looking back 25 years on, my first thought is that I just think it's sad. When you win a court case, you're normally out there high-fiving and putting the drinks in. But I don't think anyone felt, not on my team anyway, a sense of euphoria. Certainly, there were no winners. I mean, we won the court case, but we didn't win anything. You've actually lost because you've lost the support of that artist. George said in passing, "David Frost wants to do an interview with me." And I said, "You've got to do it." They know you're a man of principle. "Now, you've got to be a man of principle who's totally obsessed." Well... What happens now is that we go to appeal. I can't see any other way around it. I mean, of course, there is the ultimate option that an appeal at the House of Lords, which would take forever. It was all bluff. I mean, they intended to take it to the Court of Appeal in the UK. Never to the House of Lords, never to the European Court of Justice. They can only lose by going to appeal. Everybody was watching, including David Geffen. No-one was going to let a talent like that flounder out there for very long. So, David Geffen contacts Sony and said to them, "Listen, guys, he's never, ever going to make another piece of music for you ever." "You might as well let him go." I flew to New York, had a very quick meeting there, where basically, you know, we agreed that the contract would be sold. I was like in seventh heaven. Sony said, "We want this transfer fee" and it would've bought you a top class footballer. In fact, it most probably even bought you Lionel Messi in those days. In the end, he did whatever he did with David Geffen and Virgin and basically he bought himself out of the contract. Was it a good decision in hindsight of history? I'm not sure. George unquestionably lost the battle but won the war. Because he got the freedom that he craved for. 'Cause he felt he had to get away. Peace to George Michael. Peace. I think the whole experience of losing Anselmo, the period of grief, roughly two years, that I didn't write a note of music... And then, the absolute knowledge that the next album I was going to write would be about grief and recovery. Older is my greatest moment. ♪ Kindness ♪ In your eyes I guess ♪ You heard me cry ♪ You smiled at me ♪ Like Jesus to a child I sat at a keyboard, played a very simple string part, added a very, very gentle guitar part.

But the moment I think there is something coming, there is something important coming, I shove everybody out of the room, I go in. And then I just sing on repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat.

I was so spiritually crushed after Mum died, so crushed, and so... Felt so bloody picked on by the gods, you know. For all of my adult life, she was phenomenal, absolutely phenomenal. A terrible, horrible loss. From the day that I found out about my partner to the day that I could say, I actually felt that I was well on the mend from my mother, it was just constant fear. It was either fear of death or fear of the next bereavement, you know? And I just took it very, very badly. Very badly indeed. I've never felt that kind of depression. I felt it was something different to grief. It was on top of grief because I was grieving for my mother still. But it was something else. It was...
