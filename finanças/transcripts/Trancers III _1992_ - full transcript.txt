(anticipating music) [Voiceover] My name is Jack Deth and I'm a Trancer Hunter, I work in Los Angeles, California. In the year 2360, at least I did until I traveled through time to singe a Trancer nutcase who was running wild on the streets of old L.A. Now I'm struck in the City of Angels. And that's not too bad. I found a girl and work as a private eye. But I'm still the future cop with no Trancers to burn and no new cases in sight. (laughing) (frolicking music) That's right folks, it's time to take advantage of our holiday rates of Jack Deth's Detective Agency, if you need to check up on your spouse, do it now! Because I won't take a fee unless I catch him in the act, and until January one we'll throw in a free court-admissible video tape of the transgressors. So, give Jack Deth a call. Remember, I'm on your side. Happy Holidays and Feliz Navidad. (gun fires) (shouting in foreign language) I hate that show! (shouting in foreign language) Get your hands up! (shouting in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) Shit, what did you do to this thing? (speaking in foreign language) (shouting in foreign language) (low noise humming) (glass shattering) Holy Christ, what is that? (electricity crackling) (shouting in foreign language) (foreboding music) Where's Jack Deth? The information coordinates indicate that Jack Deth is in Paradise, where is he? (gun fires) (speaking in foreign language) (scuffling) Jack Deth, (mumbling), you know High Paradise? Jack Deth, (speaking in foreign language). [Jack] Lena, all I need is a couple of hours to nail this son of a bitch and my case is closed. I thought we agreed on a clean break, right? Jack, I have to go, Robert's here to discuss the settlement. Robert, geez, aren't we lucky enough to have a divorce lawyer right next door. Don't do that. This isn't the greatest Christmas present I've ever had. What's the hurry? I don't wanna drag this on. If I don't collect the fee, there won't be enough of a settlement for Bob to sink his teeth into, you got that? Fine, do what you need to do. Lena, after this I could back away from the detective crap for a while, give us a chance to get back on track. You know it's not that simple, there are a lot of things wrong, not just your work. I gotta start somewhere. Look angel, I wanna make the effort. I've heard that a thousand times, and you never seem to get around to doing it. Lena, I mean it this time. Meat me at Emilio's, make reservations okay? I don't know. Come on. Quiet dinner with your husband? You've had sleazier offers than that, most of them from me, what do you say? Eight o'clock, and you'd better be there. Now try and stop me. Corner table, hey listen, send Bob home will ya? Man, sporty, graying at the temples, girl's cutting about 16. Which means your ass is grass pal. Don't bother me, I'm reading. Merry Christmas. Lena's right. Singeing Trancers has more dignity than this shit. (foreboding music) What the hell are you? No physicality is identical to the description that was fed to me. If you could possibly be someone's pissed off husband, I'm only doing my job pal, you better call your old lady. You are Jack Deth. Well you got that part right, Godzilla, now what the hell do you want with me, huh? (humming) (screaming) (anticipating music) [Girl] I got it. Okay pops, tell me again what happened, and this time in English okay? (speaking foreign language) Hey fish face, where's the costume party? Hey! Oh yeah, I'm talking to you. Ugh! (foreboding music) (electricity crackling) Hey, take it easy, I got a little TCL lag here. This is a hell of an adjustment. Adjust to the adjustment. (gun cocks) (anticipating music) (gun cocks) You're a big man around here, Godzilla. I'm impressed. Compared to you I'm big everywhere. I don't know what you need more, a personality or a bullet in the head. I've already had a bullet in the head. (coughing) Shit. (foreboding music) (coughing) [Wounded warrior] Got a smoke? (coughing) That's the best I can do, start him on whole plasma, if he doesn't come around in a couple of hours, cut him off. [Assistant] But Dr. Raines! Just save it. We're short on supplies and I can't afford to waste plasma on a trooper who's not going to make it. [Android] Jack Deth, as ordered. Welcome to hell, Jack. What's going on here Ruthie? Oh I decided to redecorate my old lab, Jack. So how's the 20th century, nice and comfy? My head feels like it's been in the blender, talk to me! Let's just say we've had a few Trancer problems. Is that why finhead here Shanghai'd me up the line in the TCL Chamber? (alarm buzzing) Get out of the way Jack, keep quiet, somebody just busted security and the council needs you alive. Save your ammo, Ruthie, you always were a lousy shot. Hold your fire! It's us, don't shoot. (anticipating music) Sorry we set off the code red. I almost wasted you as a Trancer, pal. We didn't have any choice, the back's full of Trancers. A full battalion? Yeah, an attack patrol on S&D mission to find normals, they're sweeping every building on the block. They got all the fire out the gazoo for the mop-up. I want you to cover the front entrance, if they make any advance, signal red, and beat it the hell back here. I don't need anymore dead heroes. Yes colonel. Colonel? There have been a hell of a lot of changes around here, Jack, how ya been? You better hold up on the family reunion if you want me to save this man, get the surgical tray, colonel, nail his bed still. Let's take a walk, Jack. Do you smoke? Yeah. I know this is a hell of a place to meet. I'm Harris, the ranking officer. You're in command? Let's just say I'm the final word, since McNulty bought it. When? In the first firefight, he was leading an offensive into old L.A. He told me a lot about you. You're kind of a legend around here. (foreboding music) Yeah well I was just another one of McNulty's troopers. You knew the war was coming. Well I kept trying to warn him. But nobody would hear it. The cops were in control of the Trancers, hah. Then one morning we woke up, they were organized, ready to fight. We weren't. How many Trancer's asses did you singe? We lost count at 1,000,000, but they kept coming. The blood in the streets was an inch deep. And at the end... I was putting 10-year-olds into combat. The council decides who fights and who doesn't. I am the council, Jack. Everybody else is dead. Son of a bitch. But we're fighting back. Alice leads the underground. Being married to you was the best basic training she could've gotten. Did you give him his assignment? Not yet. Jack, I'm gonna send you back down the line to kill the Trancers at their source. Find the son of a bitch who started this thing and singe his ass. That's top secret information, nobody knows that. Lena knows. Lena? She wrote about it. All her early records are lost, but trust me, she knows. Ah bullshit, she never said anything to me about it. That's because she didn't know in 1992, all her knowledge came later. So we're sending you to 2005, when it all began. Nailing this trancing son of a bitch won't be a cakewalk. Screw that, I'm still a Trancer Hunter, Harris, but if you're worried about it, let me take Godzilla down the line as my backup. No chance, Shark's the last model of androids we built as the first line of defense against the Trancers, we need him here. I bet he does a hell of a job too. Yeah, but we depleted the last of the element we need for his power source. When Shark runs down, that's it. Instant junk. [Voiceover] Colonel, colonel, colonel, incoming! (guns fire) I'm sticking with you Alice! (anticipating music) (guns fire) Jack, we need you down the line, go! Follow me! (guns fire) (groans) (guns fire) (silenced gun fires) Catch your breath, Jack. If the Trancers don't return their fire right away it means they're regrouping. We've got room to move. You're getting pretty good at this shit, Alice. I know, I learned it from you. Let's move. (anticipating music) (guns fire) (helicopter blades rotating) (guns fire) (screaming) Harris gave me the coordinates. (beeping) Jack, if we don't make it... You'll see me again, Alice. You're the best thing that has happened to me in two centuries. You better get to Lena. Go, go! (anticipating music) (silenced gun fires) (electricity crackling) (rock music) Man, there ain't nothing better than that. Do you hear me? Nothing in the whole world! (glass shattering) Let's go. You're getting too pumped. Where are we going? [Blond friend] Just back to the others. Well what about the beer? [Blond friend] I got the beer, let's go. Man! Wow! Oh man... Stevens, now. Bye baby! (Laughs) Wow! (crowd chattering) That girl really liked me. You don't make enough money, private. Baby, I'm so hard a cat couldn't scratch it. Come here and give me some relief. (Laughs) Shift into low gear. You need to cool down. What the fuck do you think she's here for anyway? Besides I ain't the only one liking it. Right honey? Stevens. Next time I draw you in the pit, you're a dead man. Well excuse me for telling the truth. You got your eye on that new recruit anyway. How you feeling, squirt? Not so good. The injection is still making me feel kinda sick. You're getting stronger by the hour, I can feel it. Hell you only been in basic training three months, that's still drug level one. Wait till you get to level 10 with them damn shots. You will be Wonder-fucking-Woman. Stevens, one more word, I'll break your spine in half. (rowdy cheering) You think that you're gonna join in the Corps? I'd love to, but, I don't know if my brother thinks I'm soldier material yet. I thought I was, real smart huh? Oh shit, these things are going fast, wow. I'll be a son of a bitch, look who came down of the farm and spend a night on the town. [Voiceover] Hey honey, shake that thing. I'm ready for some beers. Relatives of yours? The Corps is my family now, baby. It's yours too. Them boys, they ain't shit on my boots. You said it yourself, lieutenant, I'm too pumped. Let me blow off a little steam. You stay in control. Broken bones only. Hell all I want is a little exercise. (foreboding music) (heaving) Are you gonna stop him? No baby brother. It might be good for you to see this. How you boys doing tonight? Just fine jarhead, how you doing? Yeah, if you're all here, I think your friends must be getting kinda lonely. Which friends are you talking about? All them goats and pigs back on the farm you're used to buggering. (mumbling) smiling faces. Boy, you're one ugly son of a bitch. (scuffling) (screaming) (anticipating music) (scuffling) Come on, asshole! (scuffling) (anticipating music) [Lieutenant] Come on Stevens that's it. Party's over, that's an order. Lieutenant. Sorry lieutenant, I'm on a level 10 high. This isn't the pit. It is tonight. (groaning) Asshole, corner pocket. (anticipating music) [Voiceover] Look out! (screaming) (glass breaking) Jesus Christ. That's the beauty of being in the Corps, honey. You can do whatever the fuck you want, and nobody is gonna stop you. You're finished, private. Come out of it, let the trancing pass. You did a good job, but we'll mop it up. You ain't mopping up shit, Mr. Jason. You ready? You created me man. You can't kill me! I'm just what you wanted me to be! (guns cock) But at the wrong time. Fire! (guns fire) (screaming) (anticipating music) Prepare him for combustion. Doug, R.J.'s gone man. All right, all right. She hit the door... Sir, Garrett has gone AWOL. We'll deal with it. But sir, Garrett is gone. I said we'll deal with it, now get ready to clear. Now! What about me? Hey Matt, relax. I will contact you about recruitment. Not a word to anyone about what you saw, right? Right, I don't even know what the hell I saw. Keep it that way. All right. (upbeat music) All right so listen. I'll have a second team up here in less than, hey, listen to me! I'll have a second team up here in less than five minutes, you know the procedure, anybody got any questions, you report them to me. Yeah. You got it, me. Yeah, yeah, I know the drill. All right. (foreboding music) (screaming) Adios private. Clean Stevens' ashes out of there and get back to your post. We got a report to make. (foreboding music) Loss of control is the one thing we should all fear. Private Stevens' training was almost complete. To lose him now is inexcusable for all of us. I'm sorry Colonel Muthuh. Stevens got excited, he initiated a level 10 trancing state. He couldn't be controlled, sir. And Garrett went AWOL? Tsk, tsk, tsk. Oh, where was Jason during all of this? Mr. Jason was dealing with the mop-up operation, sir, that's when Garrett deserted. Daddy, I'm sorry... Lieutenant Ryan. I'm sure your written report will be complete in every detail, carry on. [It. Ryan] Yes sir. In the mean time. Private Shark will give me her oral impressions of the incident. Yes sir. (foreboding music) (electricity crackling) (groans) Pfft... L.A. never changes. Big nowhere. (groaning) If there's any justice, you'll open my old office. Wherever the hell that is from here. (groaning) Oh, trance... Trance for me Jana. Show me, you can make the change on your own, you should show me, yes. Yes, that's it. That's it now, control it, yes, remember what Colonel Muthuh taught you about discipline, the discipline you must have. Now control it, exercise it, discipline, that's right. Actively feel it pulsing, feel it moving through every limb, through your brain, everywhere, that's it. Now control the flow. Yes, yes, make that flow your own. Yes, all right, good. Good. Now, look at me. Look at me, Jana. Killing you would be so easy. I know, and I always want you to feel that way about your enemies, I gave you the power to trance so you could meet your enemies without fear, but you must use that power with discretion. Otherwise you'll be good in combat. Control is the key. Without it, you'll die like that young fool Stevens. And I'd hate to see that, yes. Because you're my pride and joy. Yeah... Come to daddy. (moaning) But my brother said your program, made him a better soldier than he ever hoped. And I want that too. That's right. And all you gotta do is sign, right here. Go ahead. Go ahead. (funky music) Good man. All right. Let's go. That's it? [Jason] That's it, let's go. This might sound silly to you, but, I'm really excited. Well now you're a part of one of the most elite fighting corps that has ever existed. (foreboding music) So anyway. Sorry. My brother, that's Lieutenant R... Lieutenant Ryan, you guys met in the bar. Yeah. He's been talking about this guy, Daddy Muthuh? Colonel, Colonel Muthuh. Yeah, who's Daddy Muthuh? Colonel Muthuh. He's the doctor that created all this. He's a genius and now the most important person in your life. Holy shit. Yeah. Look to your right, guns on the wall. Man I love it. (ominous music) Could this be our new cruit? Who's his guy? [Jason] Colonel Muthuh. Uh, yes sir, I think so. No, no, just put your arm down. At ease son, I understand you'll be following in your brother's footsteps? We're very proud of Lieutenant Ryan. Well he's proud to be a part of the Trancer Program, sir. That's what I like to hear, carry on. I'll see ya. What about Private Garrett? No word on any operative yet, sir. Understand this, there are no deserters from this Corps. You were presented to me as a troubleshooter, mister. Now start shooting. (foreboding music) D-E-T-H, Deth. Yeah, like in the end of your life, Lena is the first name. Nothing at all? Thanks. Damn! Hey! Spare a five buddy? Sorry pal, all I got is... Hey that's my blanket man! (foreboding music) Here. Buy yourself a couple of bottles of warmth. Hi uh, I'm looking for Lena. Mom? Can I help you? (foreboding music) [Jack] So I guess you got a cannon for an arm, huh? I'm not bad, last game I had five strikeouts, and they were all sixth grade boys. My uncle Hap coaches me sometimes. Yeah, he was a good pitcher. Now he owns the San Francisco Rockets! I get free tickets every Christmas. I'm going outside, Ma. Okay. Nice kid. I think so. Nice place, Lena. Yeah, we like it. I know this is a hell of a shock, I would've called first, but then again, I was looking for Lena Deth. Not Ms. Forest. It's been 13 years, Jack. More like 13 hours for me. That night I was supposed to see you, I got hijacked up the line. It doesn't make any difference now. You're not gonna let me explain this, are ya? I already know what happened, you left without a word, nothing. That's what I'm trying to tell you about now. I didn't know if you were dead or alive. I waited for some sort of word from the cops, there was nothing. I woke up one morning and I was a year older. Yeah, well you don't look it. Not a year, not a day. I found someone special, Jack. Yeah, what's he like? Is he good to you? He's very down to earth if you know what I mean. You know I could always go up the line and come back in 1992 and none of this would've happened. You wouldn't do that, would you? Don't worry, besides, I got some Trancers to singe and I need your help. You read the piece on Garrett? When did the military start Trancing experiments? She claims it's been going on for years, it's a real black bag operation. She used to be a part of it, but now she wants out. Yeah well she probably shouldn't have mouthed off to the newspaper. I think she has guts. Where is she? Come on Lena, I know you. You're famous for bringing in strays. I promised to her I would keep her safe. She ain't protected here, she could help me screw this Trancing operation into the ground, don't wait for the government suits to come looking for her, I could be Garrett's only chance. Lena. Who the hell is this guy? R.J. it's okay. The gun, drop it, and keep your hands where I can see them. It's okay, he's a friend. [Jack] Do you feel safe yet? Just as soon as we verify who you are. Ex-husband. I need your help, Garrett. Yeah? Why the gun? I'm a Trancer Hunter. (anticipating music) Corvette's in the garage, I had a hell of a time keeping it away from the bank. Well at least I got something left. Oh you always loved that car more than me. That was another decade, Jack. You guys better get going. You can trust him R.J. You were really married to him, huh? Yep. Hey, thanks for everything. You know the only reason why I'm going with you is because Lena says you're all right. Fair enough. Yeah. You got a nice life, Lena. Take care, Jack. See ya. (sad music) (upbeat music) (heaving) I am charged to kick some real ass today. [It. Ryan] Don't be too sure. It's you and me in the pit, Shark. Oh, I know who I'm fighting, sir. Oh, ah... (groans) This is as fine a group of warriors as I have ever seen. You do me and the whole Trancer Program proud, all of you. Hold on there doctor. This young man is a new recruit. And I reserve the right to administer the first injection myself. Son. This is your very first step on the road to becoming the elite. One of the best fighting men in the world. (upbeat music) (groaning) [It. Ryan] It's a riot, baby brother. But you're gonna love it, trust me. Yes... Now this will be a demonstration of combat, on a high level trancing mode. It will allow you all the opportunity to see what you'll be capable of when you reach this level of readiness. (foreboding music) (anticipating music) Come on Doug, come on man! (scuffling) (crowd jeering) Come on, get up! Don't you see that I'm trying to enjoy the fruits of my labor? (crowd jeering) (scuffling) (laughs) Yeah bro, that's it, come on Doug, come on! (cheering) (scuffling) Come on, come on! Yeah! (scuffling) The reporter is Mary Azedonna. She can be taken out without any problem. (scuffling) (chanting) As usual, you miss the point. It's not the reporter, it's Private Garrett. Find her. (scuffling) (chanting) [Crowd] Gravel pit, gravel pit, gravel pit, gravel pit... And bring her back. (silenced gun fires) (groaning) I can always handle the media. (silenced gun fires) (groaning) (foreboding music) I've been locked underground so long, I forgot there was an outside world. Thanks for bringing me. Yeah. Do you wanna talk about it? Well I guess if you were sent here to kill me, you'd have done it already, right? You bet. But I only kill Trancers. Three steroid shots a day for the past four months. That's a standard dosage for a level one soldier. That's a pretty heavy boost. [R.J.] Yeah, well it's nothing compared to level 10. Look, only squids can be tranced. You've got the guts to fight back, now what happened to you huh? I wanted it, okay? You wanted what, have your brain scrambled by a fucking lunatic? I'm a soldier, Jack. It's all I got. I just wanted to be the best. So after army basic I was approached by a suit named Jason, about an elite fighting group. Elite fighting group? Trancing. It elevates your physical prowess, raises your pain thresholds, so in the field no one can stop you. [Jack] Aren't you forgetting the side effects? Like it turns you into a raving psycho and a whacked out goddamn zombie, huh? You don't have to convince me, Jack. I'm the one who is AWOL remember? I know what trancing does to you. (scoffs) Hell of a soldier, ain't I? I don't trust the guys in my outfit, now I'm a deserter. I need to get to the colonel, Garrett. You can't. But you can get to Jason. Here. Nice cover, huh? Pure CIA. Good evening. How's it going? [Jack] Okay. You shouldn't be here, this is a restricted area, didn't you see the sign? We're just having a conversation, officer. Oh well, then keep it short. I didn't mean to startle you, I just uh, noticed this gorgeous Vette, and I had to come down and take a look. Yeah, she's real fine my 409. A 60 Vette and the Beach Boys? I could've guessed. (gun fires) (groaning) (anticipating music) Come here you dizzy bitch, you just dumped a cop! [R.J.] She's not a cop Jack, she's a phony. God, you almost shot her in her eye. Nail polish, ring. That's not regulation, check if her weapon is a Browning. Shit, she's one of Jason's CIA dorks, we've been tagged. Oh, you're good sweetheart. You're real good. That old Muthuh can kiss my ass. (anticipating music) Listen Garrett, I know you're scared, but we've still got some moves left. [R.J.] The colonel is gonna find us, Jack. [Jack] No chance, I'm gonna bury you so deep. Colonel Muthuh will never find you in a million years. (foreboding music) Jack, where are we? I wanna send you to some place safe, I just haven't figured out what year. What are you talking about? Dammit! What? It was right here! Disappointed? Back up! [R.J.] Jack look out! (scuffling) One sound, private, I snap your spine like a pretzel. Another wasted sister, I knew it. What was he looking for? A way out of the shitter. Get up asshole. Now where on Earth would you wanna run? Desert your comrades in arms at a crucial juncture? No, I don't think you understand, private Garrett. Too much has been invested in you, and the only way you're gonna leave us now, is inside a body bag, is that clear? (ominous music) Prepare her for immediate reorientation. Listen to me Private Garrett. Now listen. You're mine. And I'll need you. The Corps needs you to fulfill your destiny. And you know what that is. Don't you? Take her. (groaning) Now what are you looking at? You want a medal for bringing her back? If you'd done your job, this whole thing would never have happened. Now I can only speculate as to why you were assigned to my project. But as long as you're here, I expect more of you than bureaucratic incompetence. I'm glad she's back for the Program's sake. You're glad, huh? Well I'm glad you're glad. In the mean time, Senator McCoy is coming and he wants a demonstration. You set it up for me, without fail, mister. We need that funding. If it goes as well as it did today, sir, the senator should be impressed. You never served, did you? In armed conflict. You know my record. Covert operations. No, I meant something in the field. Up to your ankles in mud and other soldiers' guts. Waiting for that moment to re-engage the enemy. Real combat. I've been on extensive maneuvers sir, in combat simulations, and I wouldn't be afraid to fight. And you're a fool. Fear can make you sharp. As soon as I pass my boards, I went right into the Army Medical Corps. For years I watched our boys die in the field because they weren't trained to fight with everything they had, that's when I started work on the trancing drug. To save them. (gun cocks) Well I find your accomplishment enviable. You don't like it when some of my soldiers refer to me as Daddy Muthuh, do you? I just find it disrespectful, sir. It's a combat name. I was mother and father to those boys in the field. But I bet you've never been there, have you? No, you've never tasted blood. And if you don't know how it feels to be a soldier, then how can you possibly know what a soldier needs to be a great warrior? (foreboding music) (laughs) My little bureaucrat. He's a squirrelly civilian, isn't he? (groaning) He doesn't get it, hit him again. [Col. Muthuh] Oh, how are you feeling now? Never better. If you had any vision, you'd understand what this is all about. So I'm gonna give you a taste, Mr. Deth, who knows, you may even be officer material. Only squids can be tranced. Like Private Garrett? Just watch my eyes, Jack Deth. Listen to my voice, lose yourself in it, no, no, no, you can't go back so why fight it, much easier, just to give yourself up to me. (screams) Just let it pass. If you wouldn't fight the drugs they wouldn't rip you as much when you come down. I hate losing control to these bastards. It's my brain, it's not theirs. You better cool it, now. Colonel Muthuh let you back into this Program instead of having you shot. So you better start acting accordingly, private. Understand? What did they do to Jack Deth? Let the colonel worry about him. Let me worry about you. (foreboding music) (groaning) I'm really looking forward to meeting our honored guest, sir. Senator McCoy is one of the few men on Capitol Hill or anywhere else, who understands what we're about. We'll take him where you want him to go, sir. You're a good man, lieutenant. Good man. (anticipating music) I'm gonna be honest with you, colonel. Unless I really see something, the money spigot's gonna be turned off. You know that Defense programs are just as important in peace time as they are in war time, senator. Now the work that we're doing here, could make the difference, in our next conflict. Well then why don't you try to impress me? You see senator, when a soldier is in a trancing state, he or she, is capable of incredible physical acts in the field, but we don't want them wasting their energy, which is why each soldier can find that discipline to trance, only when it's absolutely necessary. But the trancing mode is still started by this steroid? Isn't it? Yes it is. By the time a soldier reaches level 10 of his training, he can bring that trancing mode out of himself, without the use of drugs. Oh yes, a troop's strength can be enhanced chemically if we choose to do so, we always have that option. (groaning) (heaving) (laughs) You're right, that's one hell of a kick. You're still at charity, little bro. Wait until you reach level 10. Come on. Hey, daddy's little helpers. You fucked with the wrong brothers, Ace. (laughing) (spits) Colonel the problem isn't that your program has failed, the problem is that there's no place for it anymore. The world has changed, our defense monies are going into different pockets now. I'm not talking about the world, senator. I'm talking about this country. I'm talking about using my soldiers to wage a war against the scum that's turning this land into a cesspool. Making honest citizens afraid in their own homes. I'm talking about reclaiming our cities. Our neighborhoods, our streets. Now that's something worth fighting for, isn't it? Senator, you have no idea, what my soldiers are capable of. You're not getting me, no. You're not gonna get me, nah-ah. (foreboding music) The colonel wants to see you in the pit. Now. Very well. Oh God, Jack. Jack, it's R.J. (upbeat music) (scuffling) [It. Ryan] Jesus Matt, what are you doing? Come on, fight me Matt! I give up, Doug. I give up. (scuffling) (groaning) I told you. They are the finest warriors in the world. Oh come on, let's get outta here, Jack. What do you mean, let's get outta here, where the hell are we going? I don't know, we're just getting out of here. If you hadn't mouthed off, I would never have been in this mess. Just a second. Jack. No offense R.J., but if this is a setup, I'm gonna turn you into fish food. Jack I can't control my trancing, I don't know what I might do. I just wanna get the hell outta here. You can fight it. With my help. But you gotta want it, goddammit. And that's why I wanna show you the main trancing chamber, once a soldier is in place, his mind can be turned over to me in a matter of minutes, in fact I'll show you our latest conquest. It's amazingly effective. (gun fires) Arm yourselves! That's an order. How you holding up, R.J.? I'm holding on Jack, but the colonel's shit is pulling me the other way. Hey, just remember who the bad guys are. Let's get outta here. (anticipating music) You guaranteed me results, you can't even guarantee me my own safety in this fucking place. I will provide personal escort... You're wrong again, colonel. I'll mail you a copy of my recommendations for funding, asshole. Attention everybody, this is the colonel, this is a code red, repeat, code red! Private Garrett is trying to escape with the prisoner. (alarm blaring) (guns cocking) Bring the power out of yourself. Use the power I gave you and annihilate with extreme prejudice. (guns firing) (groaning) (gun fires) Hey R.J., you could help me kill one of these guys, you know? I'm trying Jack, but colonel Muthuh is still inside my head, I can't help it. If I pull it off, you can pull it off. Fight it goddammit, I don't wanna kill you. Jack! Fight it, goddammit! Drop to the floor! (guns fire) (anticipating music) [Jack] I knew you could do it. Nice shooting R.J. I tried Jack, I tried. (anticipating music) Kill me. Kill me! (gun fires) (groaning) (sad music) (electricity crackling) (glass shattering) Where is Jack Deth? (anticipating music) (groaning) Thanks for doing my job for me civilian. (scuffling) You know, it makes me sick, I have to spend my life defending a country full of weaklings like you. Scum like you, aren't worth defending at all. Weak Jack, weak. (Laughs) Huh? (neck snaps) Hey Godzilla. You saved my ass. That's what Colonel Stillwell sent me here to do. I'll help you fight your enemies. [Jack] Come on, I'll introduce you. (upbeat music) (gun fires) (guns firing) Very courageous strike. Mr. Deth. But one battle is hardly the war, is it? Shove the purple heart, Muthuh, I'm taking you out. Shark! (fizzling) (foreboding music) (scuffling) Damn Shark, why don't you help me get this dizzy bitch off of me? (groaning) (foreboding music) Oh you can't kill me Jack Deth. I think I can. Even your humor belongs to me. I own every thought, every impulse you posses, I know everything you're gonna say, think or do. Now look at your hands, they're starting to shake, aren't they, yeah? Now put that gun in your mouth, soldier. Like all great warriors who find new ways to win. I'll find my way, my place in history. Oh, you're starting to hesitate, Mr. Deth. That could get you fragged in the field of battle. Oh well. (gun fires) (groans) (gun fires) (groans) (glass shatters) (beeping) (serene music) Where the hell have you been? Circuit board damage, it caused my power supply to cut off without warning. Oh you're good. You're real good. (foreboding music) Don't do this. (serene music) You know Shark, I'm uh... I'm tired. I'm really tired. Alice Stillwell has instructed me to give you a message if you survived this mission. Jack my darling, I hope you're hearing this because that means we've all survived. You've given new life to thousands of people up the line, the council is forever grateful and hereby requests your presence immediately. Now I'm really pissed. (serene music) Welcome back Jack. Shark. You may approach us, Commander Deth. Cut the crap, Ruthie. You guys don't look any worse for the wear. How's your arm, Harris? Just fine, Jack. Managed to have any fun down the line? Nothing but. Alice. It's good to see you, Jack. The council has summoned you for a very special reason. Not interested. I wouldn't mind going to some of those islands offshore with you though. Not till we get this straightened out. You did a good job for us down the line, Jack. We want you to keep on doing it. We're appointing you our official Peacekeeping Emissary of Time and Space. Wait a minute that sounds like you can bounce me from year to year. This is an official appointment Jack, it can't be declined, congratulations. For what, who the hell knows where you can send me next? (funky music) We do. But don't worry, you won't be alone. I could get used to this again. Oh not me, him. (laughs) Here Jack, you're gonna need this. [Jack] Harris thanks a lot. So how about it Jack? You wanna start your vacation by taking me to dinner? That's the best idea I've heard all century. Come on Shark, if we're gonna be partners. You'll like me once you'll get to know me, Jack Deth. You know Shark this could be the beginning of a beautiful... Forget it. (serene music)
