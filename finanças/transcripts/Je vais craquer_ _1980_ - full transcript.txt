Chris! YOU ARE IN THE BUSINESS DISTRICT Don't you remember me? Ozendron. Jerome Ozendron. Jerome Ozendron? Jerome! How are you? Good. What are you doing here? Well, it seems to be working out for you. It's going okay. Classy! We get by! What about you? I followed your work a bit. I remember three or four years ago, we saw you on TV a lot. You had a leading role in a film too. It sold 800 tickets in Paris. The biggest flop of the season. I'm screwed, man. Broke. Don't talk nonsense! I don't even remember who I ended the night with. Look, there comes a time when you have to decide to be an adult. I lost my way. I know, it's not fun. You have to choose. It's not easy for anyone, by the way. Remember me? I wanted to be a writer. But I gave it up. Well, temporarily. And are you happy? With your wife? You know, we've been married for ten years. We've had our rough patches. But we got through them. We made compromises. We've struck a balance now. We're a team. We try to make our kids happy at home. Well, you're happy, then. Yeah. Maybe that's happiness. And the sex? Well, you know. After ten years. Sometimes we rekindle the flame, mind. It sounds stupid, but in those moments it's sometimes really intense. You know, we know each other so well. You could've said. I look a state. But you look great! It's just a friend. Don't you think daddy's friend is handsome? Is that all the whisky? Look at the state of me! At 30 years old, he seems so deflated. No money. No dreams. Classic hit! Poor guy. I feel sorry for him, really. Mom, don't you think daddy's friend is handsome? The worst part is I feel he's bitter, you know? And a little jealous of me. There you go! Well, I need a good shower. Come on, stop, Ariane! Did you do stunts in the hang-glider in the film? Yes. I never have a stunt double. My dad doesn't know how to hang-glide. He can't disco dance either! What would be the point? We never go out. It was good for me to spend a night with family. Honestly. - I wish I could help you. - You're kind. But you know. You coming for a drink? No, I can't. I didn't plan it with my wife. And then you know, hanging out in bars. Come on, just one drink. - Well, okay. - Let's go. - Well, just for five minutes. - Okay, five minutes. You're too old to be out in jeans and a leather jacket, old man. Think about it! Let's face it. In this shit society, you're nobody if you don't have money. I could try to get you a job at my company. As a salesman. You'd start at 5000 bucks per month plus commission. But it doesn't stop you from acting as well. Look at me. I'm still writing. For real! It just gives you security. If you stick with the company, in two years, you could easily make ten grand per month. Natacha! - Where were you, flaker? - What a bastard! We waited for you at Stephan's. How was Serge last night? He wanted to play backgammon with me. I took six grand from him! He was furious! Chris, I think I'll leave you with your friends. Really? We're going for a drink at Castel's. Girls, look after my friend Jerome. - Yeah! - There. This is lovely, but I'm up early tomorrow. No. Now we have you, we aren't letting you go! I'm warning you, Natacha is a total nymphomaniac. He's shy. He's blushing! I love shy men! It's been a long time since I had sex with a shy guy. Don't worry, it's fine. Hello. - Are you well? - Yes. She had a muzzle before the operation. Not pretty, she had a big mouth. What do you for work, Jerome? I work in sales. That's fascinating. Well, that's what I do to bring home the bacon. Actually, I'm a writer. - Really? - Yes. That's amazing! Novels? Yes. I should introduce you to Maxence, then! - Maxence! - Why did I say that? Maxence! Come here! He's the literary critic at the Nouvel Obs. It was packed. - Natacha! How are you? - Are you well? I'm doing well. - Hello. - This is Jerome. He's a novelist. - Jerome - Jerome Ozendron. - Hello. - Yes, of course. I really like your work. - We're going down. You coming? - Yeah! Come on. We're going to dance. So, how old is she? She's going on school trips now. I need to liven up, for God's sake. Sorry, I'm a terrible dancer. I love men who can't dance, it makes me feel less dopey. I really need to think of something to say to her. You're very pretty, Natacha. It's nice of you to say that. You must be told that a lot. Yes, but it's always nice to hear, you know. Do you want to do a line? It's good stuff. Yeah, great! What is this? It's really good stuff for you to try. This'll loosen you up, you'll see. No, I don't do that stuff. Try it at least once. No, seriously, I prefer whisky. This guy is really impossible. Try to enjoy yourself a little! Are you finished attacking him? She's jealous that you're not interested in her. Oh? - This is a classy house. - Yeah, it's not bad. It's an American friend's. He comes to Paris three times a year and likes someone to be in his apartment. You abandoning me? Shit, I need to get in the mood! Chris is a madman! Have you known him a long time? We were in high school together. He was the star pupil. He was already betting on horses and poker. All the girls were after him. He's crazy. He's terrible! I've got to stop talking about him! You're going to burn yourself on my cigarette! Well, this is a flop. Where did they go? They've gone to make love, I guess. Yes, well, do you not like me? Why did you say that to me? It was great. I think you're really kind. - You know how to play matchstick? - Matchstick? It's a Brazilian game. You been to Brazil? No. I go every year with some friends for the carnival. Come with us. Malika is quite the extrovert! Damn Christian! Don't you want to play matchsticks? No! If I don't screw her, I'll get hives. Don't make that face all night. What is it? I want to make love to you. Well, I don't. You haven't done anything to make me want to. No! Calm down! Calm down! This is crazy! Calm down! He's going to rape me! That's enough! Stop playing the big man, it doesn't suit you. Sorry, I was ridiculous. Yes, absolutely! Well, I think it would be best if I leave. That seems good to me. Are you staying here? I can walk you home if you want. No need, thanks. I'd like to see you again. Who knows? Good night. I don't give a shit about that bitch! She's a snob. I bet she's frigid. Shit, my keys! Sorry, I must have left my keys in the lounge. Okay, come in. - Shut the door on your way out. - Okay, thanks. Jerome! Are you not in bed yet? Is that all you have to say to me? Don't make a fuss. I just went for a drink with Chris! You could've said. I almost rang the police. Where were you, dad? You too? What did I get myself into? Go to bed! Leave him, he saw I was worried and couldn't get to sleep. We're not making a big deal of it! I went for a drink with a friend, that's it! Go to bed, sweetie. You're not going to start crying now! Hey, come here. Come on. Why don't you take this off? What's going on? Did she not want you? Who? The girl that left all her hair on your jacket. Mommy, pee pee. Okay, I'm coming. Dad? What is it now? Nathalie's crying. She had a nightmare. Can I come to your bed for a while? No! Go to bed, both of you! What's with all of you tonight? What's wrong? Why are you crying? - Dad yelled because she had a nightmare. - Are you mad? I didn't yell because she had a nightmare! I told her off for not sleeping. I didn't shout. He did shout at her! Did I ask for your opinion? I didn't shout at her! I told her to go to bed! For God's sake, it's 5 a.m.! Dad's shouting. Now you've scared the little one. He's not shouting, sweetie. He's just tired. Come on, give him a kiss. Come on, off to beddy-byes. Come on. There. Let's go. Go to bed! Let's go! - You're too hard on Patrick. - Not now. It's never the time. - He's a child. - I want to fuck, understand? Fuck! Where are you going now? Am I allowed? What are you doing? I'm using what my gyno gave me. I can't stand the IUD anymore. Well, we're swimming in sexiness. If we have sex like that every time you go out, you should go more often. Do you love me? Of course I love you. Don't worry. You'll get her some time. Who? The girl that left her hair on your jacket. Can't you stop yourself from talking nonsense? Aren't you sleeping? What a question. Clearly I'm sound asleep! Is it that serious? - What? - This girl. Fucking women! Life isn't just about sex! Make us some coffee instead of talking nonsense! What is it, Jerome? I'm fed up. Fed up with this shitty life! What are you talking about? You're in a great situation. A great situation. A rat is what I am! A rat in a maze. Green light, I go, red light, I stop. Career plan, house savings plan, management pension. Would you rather be in Chris' position? He has an apartment in the 16th arrondissement and always goes to Castel's. So you envy him? Me? I envy that failure? That parasite? Every night at Castel's, you'd have to pay me! All those snobs, all those bitches! I don't understand you. You've everything to be happy. I've failed in life. What would you like to do? You know very well. Write. - Why don't you do it? - Right, and die of hunger! You could write in the evening. Instead of playing bridge or watching TV. I'd like to see you try with the work I do. No, I'd need six months. Six months of freedom. To find myself again. To get my ideas in order and write seriously. Six months. Six months of real freedom. Colette, could you come here, please? Dussol sent me a very unpleasant message. He didn't get a copy of the circular on leasing. You didn't tell me to send one. You're joking! I told you 100 times! I'm going to have to give another speech on the flow of information. I'm sorry. Sorry, Colette. I'm tired this morning. Did you plan a meeting with Ratier from the IRC? Mr. Choulet's secretary said there was no point. - You know what Choulet did? - No. Stole my IRC contacts! And I heard it from my secretary! No! He's crossed the line! He's looking for me and will find me! I want to see Duran-Rodel. But that's what Choulet wants! The boss swears by him at the moment. Just grin and bear it! Little shit! I'm the one that trained him when he came here! Duran-Rodel is going to listen to me! Hello? Connect me to Mr. Duran-Rodel's secretary. More and more important decisions relating to my service are made by commercial management without me being consulted. For God's sake! It's my guys in the firing line. I have a say in this, don't I? Listen, my friend. Let me thank you for your honesty. It's a mark of confidence that really touches me. Absolutely. Your concerns are very much in line with my own. I have always fought for larger participation from everyone in decisions. I was very opposed to the appointment of Laurent Choulet. It isn't about Choulet, sir. There's nothing personal in this. It's a question of principal, of commercial philosophy. Yes, of course, my friend. But my power is limited. You know the complexity of our organization. I warned them of this. I knew that a man of your caliber would not stand for this. Your departure will be a loss for the company, but I respect your decision. With your temperament, it would have become unbearable. Of course, we'll put it down as a redundancy on economic grounds. Yes, I insist. It's completely normal. - You have plans, of course? - It's just that-- A man like you doesn't come out of the trench without a back-up. But I don't want to be indiscreet. Be sure to keep in touch sometimes. And one last time, Jerome. I can call you Jerome? - Please. - Thanks for everything. No, thank you. "No, thank you." What an idiot. I'm such an idiot! He kicked me out and I thanked him! - Did you hear the news? - No. - I no longer work here. - What? I stuck my resignation in that moron Duran-Rodel's face! - What'll you do? - Don't worry. I'm not the sort to leave the trench without a back-up. Why didn't you tell me I'm such an idiot? Stop! There's one person that knows. Choulet, he really fucked me over. He got that right. Hats off to Choulet! I bet everyone knew except me, like the cuckolds they are. I hadn't thought about it, but I'm not a cuckold too, am I? Come on! Let's go! If you cheat on me, you can tell me honestly, no kidding. I think it's quite normal, an idiot like me! Are still not asleep? Do you know what time it is? Come on! Beddy-byes. Come on! What's wrong with daddy? - He's sick. - He's drunk! Finally, if you think about it Patrick, don't talk about dad like that! I don't want to hear another word, or I'll be angry. Good night. An idiot that knows he's an idiot isn't as bad as idiot that doesn't know he's an idiot. Jerome? Jerome? I'm over here! Feeling better? I'm feeling great! Sit down. I have something important to tell you! Jerome, you're scaring me. Today is a great day! Brigitte, I'm free! I was thinking, unemployment is an opportunity of a lifetime for me. I wanted six months off. I got it. I'm going to get 90% of my salary and I'm going to write my book. I'll have time to live again, to dream, to read, to roam, to look after my wife and kids, to find myself! Advanced liberal society, I love you! I'm a future Goncourt prize winner. Don't get ahead of yourself. What do you want? Brigitte! Look after her, for God's sake! How can I work with the kids on my back? That's not true. He's not working, he's just smoking! He's working in his head, sweetie. He's thinking. I preferred when you were crazy with work. You were calmer. If you think it's easy to work with kids, the hoover and you coming in every five minutes! Do you think it's easy to live with a man who acts like a caged lion? You don't get what creating is. The door, please! SOCIETY, PRISON, FALSE SATISFACTION I CRY TO YOU WITH RAGE I CRY OUT IN DISPAIR POET FREED FROM THE PSYCHIATRIC HOLDS OF A PRISON STATE Mr. Policeman? How handsome you are! How pretty you are! This bad luck is filling me up with nerves. What do you want from me, woman? What's in your hand, Mr. Policeman? What is it? My God! Have you never seen a truncheon, woman? A truncheon! It looks so nice! And sweet! It feels hard! Let me borrow it, Mr. Policeman, please! This bad luck is filling me up with nerves. Have you ever seen a woman so crazy? Move along, bitch! If you don't go, I'll stroke your clitoris! My God! It's your little fish, my husband. How are you today? Is she smiling at me? My God, my sweet fish, I'm doing very well today. This bad luck is filling me up with nerves. I locked up a poet. I took the little girl down. So, Liliane, what do you think, honestly? Great, seriously. I really like it! You know, last week we played for the strikers at Saint-Ouen. It was so good! The guys really reacted. They got very involved and everything. I really like the show! It's good. It's really good! You think so? Yeah, it has a whole new tone! Their work is fully collective. That's interesting. I'd really like to see you after the show. I'm impressed by your work. I'm a writer myself. Oh yeah? What do you write? A type of novel. I want to break the traditional story structure. - I see - It's a new approach. Foul little bitch! It's fascinating to see all these props after the show is over. It's ridiculous and really moving at the same time. Yeah, well, listen. Leave it like that. That will do. It's so stupid how this side of culture is divided: theatre, dance, cinema, literature. We're all here to create for it. Yeah, that's true. We should merge it. It would make it better for everyone. Yeah. - I'd like to see you again. - Yeah! Why not? - Can I get your number? - Ask Liliane. - Who? - Liliane! Do you mind if I accompany you for a while? No, if you want to. I'm not going far. My car is parked nearby. It's funny, you know. What's great about you is that it seems like you're really authentic. I mean You're a very clear-headed guy. Really, do you think so? What am I getting into? You know, I paint. What do you want me to do about it? I draw things like that which come to me. It's more like a pattern search, you know? I don't feel ready to really create. She has an ugly face but a nice ass. You're young, you've got time! It's funny, I never show my drawings to anyone. But it feels different with you. Tell me honestly what you think. Yeah, of course. A quick shag and I'm out of here. Mom? Mom, this is Jerome. - Well, a man. That's good. - Have a seat, Jerome. - Excuse me. - Ask him the question. Do you know what an infibulation is? - A what? - An infibulation! - No, I don't. - That's telling, isn't it? Doesn't surprise me at all. Here, look. This is an infibulation. No, look! Be brave and look at it properly. Henriette is working on a book on genital mutilation of African women. Will I tell you how infibulation is done? I really don't want to know. That's a typical man's reaction! Stop, your stories are annoying him. It's easy to deny reality. You're a pain in the ass! Come on, Jerome. No, you need to know! Infibulation is the full removal of the clitoris, the labia minora and a large part of the labia majora. Then, they stitch up the vulva so as to make the vaginal opening as small as possible. Jerome, are you coming? Leave him be! Off you go. You have better things to do. Excuse me. And, as the poor women have to pee and have periods, a match is inserted in the wound during the healing process, all without anesthetic of course and in unimaginably unhygienic conditions! Did you see his reaction? He ran away. So, your mother's friends. - Oh, don't even talk to me about it! - Yeah. That's a portrait of dad by Toschnick. And is this one of you? No, that's mom, by Boullouche. Boullouche was my dad's best friend. Ah, right. I don't feel like getting laid! The old ladies make me feel sick. I won't get a hard-on for two weeks. So, it may be awkward with your mom and her friends next door. I want you. Listen. I hate rushed love. Do you know what we'll do? I'll call you and we'll have a party some night. Kiss me. - Take me! - Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop, you're strangling me! Okay! Okay, but to do that, I need to get undressed. What's the matter now? Are you crying? No, I'm crying because it was so great, the two of us. You wouldn't know, it was like I was going to die. Did I scream? Do you call that screaming? You screamed so loud the whole town heard. You screamed too. You bet! You tore half my back out with your nails, I hate that. Paris is beautiful when you make love! Yeah. I hope no one sees me with this fat ass. - Wait, come in here! - Who is it? Madam. A Coca-Cola and a ham sandwich. Sex gives me a big appetite. And you? Here, over there. I'm warning you, five minutes. Listen, don't be silly. I have to talk to you seriously. - What do you want? - Nothing. A dry martini. I'd like to pay right away. Fourteen fifty. I know you. Ah, yes. You're Chris' friend, aren't you? Good evening. I get ravenous after I have sex! Can you be a bit quieter, please? It doesn't bother me if people know I've just had sex! Sex is beautiful, not embarrassing! We don't need to shout it from the rooftop! I'll rent you an apartment in Rio, so-- Again, that's not the issue. - How come? - I wasn't always this way. I was full of complexes when I was young. Forget what I said six months ago and listen to me now! I thought I was ugly. You may laugh, but it's true. I don't want to see you anymore. My mom really helped me with my sexual liberation. My mom is great! She has a lover 30 years younger than her. He's madly in love. And a jealous one at that. You know, it's beautiful at her age. Can you walk me out? Yes, I'd love to. Enough of your comedy act! Sit down now! Sit down or this won't end well! Shall we go? Yes! What do you want? Do you want me to fly off the handle? I'd like some peace, that's all. Are you coming? Sir! The check. Here. - Do you have any change? - No, hurry up! I think he's following us. Yes, that's him. Step on it! This guy is nuts, he's going to cause a crash! Pull over, bastard, or I'll beat the crap out of you! - Let go of me! - Speed up! I'm going as fast as I can! He's crashing into me now! This man is crazy! That's just how he is. - Turn in there. - That's a no entry street! Come on, Jerome, quickly! You wait here! Natacha! Natacha! What happened here? Nothing, he smashed everything. Don't bother, I changed the locks! Natacha, open this fucking door or I'll break it down! He's crazy. You'll pay for this, bitch! - That's enough! - Shut up! What did you do to him to get him in that state? Nothing. I dumped him, that's it. He struggles to accept women leaving him. To make matters worse, he's just turned 40. He'll get what's coming for him. Take that, bastard! Little bitch! Asshole! Leave the car alone! You must be kidding! - Faggot! - Stop! I'll call the cops! Loser! He's a crackpot! Sorry, he's bad-tempered! I had a very challenging week. So, do you live with that maniac? Yes, for five years. - And has it been five years of that? - No! We had some great times. He's quite out of the ordinary. Why'd you leave him? He wouldn't get divorced to marry me. I'm 28 and I've already lost five years to him. That's too long. Excuse me. Hello? No, you know you're being ludicrous now! Of course he's my lover. I'm free, aren't I? Listen, I know your old number is blocked. No, you're not going to kill him. It's not his fault, poor guy. He didn't even know you existed. Come on, your friends have better things to do. I've already told you everything I have to say to you. Goodbye! What's this about his friends? Nothing, he has some gangster friends he relies on. And he threatens to get them involved all the time. He's a big kid, you know. Yes. - Do you want to have sex with me? - Now? Yes, of course, Natacha! Natacha. You're going to undress calmly, okay? Yes. I really wasn't great. But I'm not always like that, you know. No, it was really good. But honestly, why did you have sex with me? I had an annoying day and normally having sex relaxes me. And if Michel breaks your face, at least you get some compensation. Jerome. What are you doing? Waiting for you. I was panicking with paranoia. There, you're home. Goodnight. When will I see you again? You won't, sweetheart. Our paths part here. You're kidding, Jerome. I need to see you again. What are you on about? You barely know me. What happened between us meant a lot to me. What happened? Listen, I'll call you tomorrow and we can talk about it then. - You promise? - Swear. Off you go, party's over. I'll call you tomorrow. Bye! She's a pain in the ass! But you don't have my number! Jerome! Good evening. Hello. Were you waiting for me for dinner? No. I should've called to say I wasn't coming. I'm not doing well lately. I don't know what's wrong with me. I can't write. I'm getting nowhere. It's driving me mad! The thing is I can't get work done here. I can't concentrate. It's because of the atmosphere here. I need my own space to work. I'm going to get a room in the Latin district or in Saint-Germain. What do you think? Am I supposed to think something? I don't know. We'll talk about it. You're my wife, right? We'd be a little less on top of each other all day. Do you think you should spend money like that now? You're unemployed, right? Well, you know. A good room for 500 bucks a month. Do what you want. Natacha! It's very hot. Shall we go home? If you want. Hello, you! Natacha, darling, how are you? - Great, you? - Michel not here? No, he's in Brazil. Jerome Ozendron, what a nice surprise! - Good evening, sir. - Please, call me Arnaud. Sit down, Jerome. Hello. So, are you a friend of Natacha's? You know, I knew her. She was still a kid. She was adorable. I know she has one flaw. It's impossible to have sex with her before five in the morning. Yes, you have to keep up with her. She's at 78 Regine Castel every night. She's a little night owl! And tell me, what are you up to? I've completely changed my path. I'm writing a book. That's brilliant! We're going to Palace. Are you coming to Nikkie Gesner's party? No. Not tonight, darling. Good night. - Good night. - See you soon, my friend. Cheerful as ever, aren't you? I am very happy! Renoma, Dior, this is Natacha's doing! I bet she makes you wear American boxers. I don't want a very late night. Yesterday, it was pushing 6 a.m. We'll do a quick lap then leave. I'll go and get the car. Nikkie and Pomme will meet us there. Why are you dragging him around? He's so annoying! I think he's really sweet. Shit, this is bad! It's really bad, damn it! - Hello. - It's Liliane! You again? Leave me alone, I don't want to see you anymore, damn it! Jerome? No way, oh my God! I won't let this end this way after what happened between us. But what happened? We screwed once, that's it! Jerome. Am I going to have you on my back all my life? That's crazy! - Jerome. - Leave me alone! She's totally bonkers. If there's a crazy person out there, they come for me! I could've broken a leg the day I shagged her. No way, this must be a nightmare! Fuck it, I'll escape through the toilet. Have a seat. Do you want something to eat? I'm not hungry. - Any desserts? - No thanks, the check. Yes, sir. Listen, it's not normal to get yourself in such a state. You wanted to talk to me? - Yes, because-- - I'm listening. What's going on? It's okay! Calm down, Liliane. Come on, you're okay. Hang on. Don't move. It's really not that bad. - Thank you, sir. - Come on, it's nothing. Wait. It's okay. Come on. Come on, we'll go to my house. Natacha! - Hello. - Hello, it's Liliane. - You again? - I wanted to hear your voice. You'll hear it! Leave me alone, understand? Leave me alone! I never should've fucked that bitch again! She won't let go of me now! Here, I had Michel on the phone this morning. - Is he still in Rio? - Yes. You know we're making a film together? He's making a name for himself now? He found some sponsors over there and he's getting the ball rolling. Do you have actors? We have Regina Da Silva in the leading role, a beautiful girl! Very famous in Brazil. You'll tell me too much. Michel always has to look for women. And what's it about? We had a great story but it slipped through our fingers. The whole thing was set up and we were left without a script. Well, why don't you write for cinema? There's a huge market. Jerome is a novelist. Yes, I write a little. Really? That little one over there isn't bad. Do you want her? - Are you giving her to me? - Yes. I get the sense that she's taken. - No, he's an idiot. - Always so helpful, Christian. My dear, there's no such thing as foolish tasks. Why don't you write something for Sacha? Yes, why not? That's a good idea. Mind, the main character has to be mixed-race. But Regina's great! You see, she's an extroverted island girl who drives men crazy. So, half of the filming takes place in Paris and the other half in Rio. Listen, I'll think about it. That's it, mission accomplished. Chris is irreplaceable. Her knight in shining armor doesn't seem happy. I must say, he really looks like an idiot. Natacha! Darling, I have a friend who would really like to meet you. Prince Abderrahmane Sha. Do you mind if I take her away for a little while? Of course. If you have a good story, I'm all ears. Okay. Sacha, this is Eva, the best shot in Paris at the moment. Enough! He's talking nonsense. My dear child, your voice is as beautiful as you are! I'm going back to LA. Please, go ahead. - No, after you. - Excuse me. What's wrong? You're not going to sulk again. I'm not sulking. You've ignored me all evening. And you're perfectly in love with that awful dago. Claude asked me to do it because it's an important business relationship for him. Plus, no one's forcing you to go out with me. Oh come on, it's okay. That's not what I meant. And I did warn you. I can't stand when we make a scene! Goodnight! Look, sorry. I was being stupid. Let's not leave each other like this. Can I come in? Not tonight. I'm tired. And it's late. It's never a good time. We must've had sex three times in four months! I'm going mad. I can't take it! I was honest. I did warn you. What am I to you? Go and get a good sleep now, promise? You're not to the club to pick up girls. I don't want you to cheat on me! Will I see you tomorrow huh? Hey? Bye bye. He's going to join her. Bitch! All these whores! I'm such an idiot! Back already? It's only three o'clock. Please, not now! I'm not in the mood tonight. Sorry, but I really need to speak to you. Leave me alone. Not tonight! I couldn't care less about your moods. Well, that's nice. I've cried for three months without you noticing. I told you 100 times. My book's a mess and it's bothering me. Let's talk about your book. You don't see the kids, come home at dawn, when you bother to come home. And this? - What do you have to say to this? - What is that? Your bank statement. You're opening my mail now? Jerome, you've spent 8000 francs of allowance this month. You've dipped into your savings and sold stocks. And you're unemployed. Give me that! It's money I earned. It's not your business! I'm your wife and we have three kids. I have a right to know what's going on! I'm sleeping in the studio, is that what you want? No, that's too easy! Leave me alone! Jerome, stay here! God, don't I have a right to live a little? What the hell are you doing? I was waiting for you. Listen, Jerome, I really needed to see you. I'm not doing well, Jerome. I need you. At 4 a.m.? What's wrong with you? But it's been a week since I last saw you. Let me in just for a moment. Listen, leave me alone. Jerome, I'm begging you! She's a freak! - I'm begging you. - That's enough! Jerome. You're not staying there all night. Don't be so hard on me. You know I'm fragile. Right, come in. I'll only be five minutes. Yes, that's it, five minutes! And your novel? My novel? Here, this is my novel! Here! Take it! Take it! I've lost it. I can't take it anymore. Calm down, Jerome. Please, calm down. Tell me what's wrong. Here, look, why don't you lie down? You'll feel better. Come on. Is it your novel? But all writers get depressed at times. It's normal. "Writer," my ass! I've written 50 pages in four months. It's shit! And, on top of that, everything's going wrong: my wife, money, the rest. What the hell are you doing? We'll have sex to relax you. She's crazy. Aren't you going to ask my opinion? I don't want to, you look like shit! You don't even give me a hard-on! Let yourself go. You'll see, it'll relax you. Well, don't be shy! This is crazy. It's unheard of! She's hot. If she didn't have such an ugly face... - Wait. - Jerome. Wait, don't move. I'll give you what you want, you'll see! You want it, you'll get it Come on! - Take it! - Here you go! - Yes, take it! - Here you go! That's enough of this bullshit! Discipline. A strict routine. You have two weeks to write the script. Then get back to your novel. Four pages a day. Boom, you're done! Natacha, this story is over! She's made enough of a fool of you! Yeah? Is Christian here? Yeah. Excuse me! It's for you. Hi, Chris. - Say, isn't that Eddy Mitchell? - Don't talk so loud! I feel like it was another crazy night! God, the smell of cigars when you get up. Can't you shoot heroin like everyone else? Morning! Have a seat, Jerome. Yes. On your feet, mama! Get up! You're kidding, no? I brought you my script. Tell me what you think. Be honest. Yeah, of course. You had fun last night. Enough. Because you didn't have a good time too? I think I did pretty well in the end. This is a summary. Just about 30 pages. - That's enough. - Careful not to get it dirty. I always said it was a good deal for you, movies. "The Rat Race"? - Yes. - Leave me alone! Not a bad title. Stop! No, shit. You got jam on it! Damn it! It's fine! "It's fine", but oh well. What is that thing you've got? A script my friend wrote for Sacha Bluwein. I got a postcard from Natacha. She's in the Bahamas. With her Arab? Did you know about him? Of course! What a big, oily heap! I hear he's crazy in the sack. - Right? - Can I see? Careful, damn it. Watch out! You're going to completely ruin my thing! - A little milk? - Stop it! - You're not funny! That's my work! - Wait, I'll save it for you. We never see you anymore. I've been messing around too much. I don't see my kids anymore. I write, read, I play with my kids. As good as Regine and Castel. Oh my, this is so erotic! Let's see! No, stop, damn it! I'll need to retype it! This is getting ridiculous! What a pain in the ass! Kids! Go and play in your room now! Do you want me to get angry? Stop yelling at the kids like that! Anyway, it's time for school. Come on, hurry up. You'll be late again. Do that up. Nathalie, your schoolbag! Can you put your cup in the dishwasher? Hey, it's like a party here! How long are you going to sulk? I got back on the right track, didn't I? What should I do? Drop at your feet and thank you? - Hello, sir. - Hello, ma'am. Thank you. Do you know what this is? An invitation from Sacha Bluwein. Chris' friend, the producer. He's having a party. He wrote: "I hope that you and Mrs. Ozendron will join us." "I read your text with great interest and would like to talk to you about it." This could be the start of a new career. The cinema, can you believe it? It's crazy! You seem very interested in what's happening to me. If I'm boring you with my stories, tell me! I'm very happy for you. You really are a wife that gets involved in her husband's life. You make me feel so supported! That dress is a bit old fashioned. It's my only fancy dress, sorry! You can go on your own. I'll go home. I don't mind. Look, it's fine. Please don't start. So, it's going to be a very Parisian party. Don't let it bother you. The key is to stay natural, very relaxed. I won't drink the fingerbowl water if that's what you mean. Oh my, you can be so touchy. I just wanted to make you feel comfortable, that's all. Your friend Sacha is more interested in my wife than my script! No, he's crazy. Keeping an eye on your wife? Jealous? I don't allow you to be jealous of someone other than me. That's right, you make fun of me too! What's wrong? Are you annoyed? Why would I be annoyed? You disappeared without saying anything. You know that you're my favorite whipping boy. There's your Neanderthal! He's going to jump down my throat again! - Michel? - Yes. No, he's really calmed down since he returned. We're on very good terms now! Is he with that girl? Yes. He brought her back from Brazil. Clearly Michel only likes whores. That's charming for you. But I'm a whore too, didn't you know? Come on, stop it! Michel? Why don't you come to Brazil with Natacha? You're my guests. That's very kind of you. I don't know how to thank you. - Do you play polo? - No. - Tennis? - That neither. Well, that's okay. We'll play gin rummy and poker. I don't play cards either. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host. Well, he's good, Natacha. Does he screw, at least? Like a god, my darling! Mr. Ozendron, where were you? We were looking for you. - I see you have been acquainted. - We met before. - Did Mr. Ozendron mention his script? - Yes. It's excellent. It could be a very good story for us! Are you serious? Do I look like I'm joking? No, I thought it was very good! Of course, it needs some more work. We need to expand it. We need to adapt it to Regina's character. It's a first draft. You'll have seen Laure's character is Yes. I'll give it to you. It's very good. We need to talk about it properly. Call my office. - I'm counting on you. - For sure. And, in the meantime, I'm keeping your wife tonight. - If you'll let me. - Please. Well, if you'll let me! He's amazing! You know, if my wife saw us dancing like this Don't worry about your wife. Focus on me. It's funny. I want you tonight. Come on, let's go to my house. I can't do that to her, you know that? It's an order! But I can't, honey. Who would take her home? Chris! He'll find an excuse. He's very good at it! - We're leaving. - Where are you going? To my house, of course. Natacha, I can't do that to Brigitte. You made love to me like a real little man tonight. Will we do it again? I mean, more often? If you keep making love like that, I won't be able to resist you. I'll become clingy, jealous, a pain in the ass! You won't be able to put up with me. Stop it, you're making fun of me! Do you think they'll make the film? Of course. To annoy me. To annoy you? Well, yes. When I met Michel, I wanted him to finance a film so I'd get a role. The bastard never wanted to. Now he's doing it for this big black whore. He knows it will piss me off. But I thought you were friends now! You know you're incredible in your own way? You see nothing, hey? Completely out of it. Do you still want to be in movies? - I'm old now. - Are you joking? I'll write my next one for you. I'll make a role for you. It's funny. I feel like I was made for cinema. - For real! - Who knows? Maybe in a few years we'll be at Cannes film festival together. You as an actress, me as a screenwriter. Don't dream too much. Jerome Ozendron, take one. Jerome Ozendron, there's no need to introduce you to our viewers. Famous novelist, you've written a lot for the cinema. Your last film was awarded by the Jury at the Cannes Film Festival. Jerome, has success changed your life? Has success changed my life? Has success changed my life? Thanks, Saïd. Well, what is success? Yes, money, of course. You know, for a creator, money is, above all, the freedom to work. Yes, Jerome works and I spend the money. Darling. You sleeping, old man? Potel! Old Potel! - How are you? - And you? - I'm good. - How are you? - Where to? - The office. Get in, I'll drop you off. Okay. How are things at the company? Duran-Rodel always makes his headlines and Choulet's in the doghouse. Choulet! Good God, Choulet! He's still around? - That seems so long ago to me. - How's your wife? - I'm getting a divorce. - Shit! Poor Brigitte! Yes, it's going to be hard for her. I'll try to make her suffer as little as I can. To do it properly. It isn't working anymore. We've reached a tipping point. I have to be brave enough to confront things. It'll be better for her, for the kids, for everyone. I'll tell her this time. The more I wait, the harder it'll be. Brigitte? We won't be the first couple to get a divorce. Hello. Brigitte, I need to talk to you. Are you listening to me? I said I need to talk to you. It's serious. Good timing, I need to talk to you too. Okay, go ahead. I'm listening. I made a decision. It can't go on like this. I have to be brave enough to confront it. We're at tipping point. - I'm divorcing you, Jerome. - Huh? I wanted to try to do things properly. No, wait. You've taken me by surprise. I need to think about it. We can't make a decision like that. Think about the kids. It's much better for them. But no, we need to talk about it! Maybe we can fix it. There's no other way. I married you when I was 18. First, we struggled to make ends meet, then the kids, this life. I supported you because I loved you. I don't love you anymore. What do you mean? I'm 30 years old, Jerome! I need to live, to have fun, to laugh, to go out. - Hello? - When did you stop loving me? Yes. - Hey? - It's for you. Where are you going? Brigitte, where are you going? - Hello. - Hello, Jerome? Liliane? You can't call me here! It's because-- Leave me alone! Go fuck yourself, you hear me? For God's sake, where are you going? Brigitte! To the hairdresser. I'm going to be late. Did you hit your head? You say you want a divorce then get your hair done? - We must talk about it. - I said what I had to say. Please, darling, stop! All is not lost for us. We'll be great friends, you'll see. I'd like to ask you a favor. Of course, whatever you want. Watch the kids for two weeks? I'm going away. Okay, no problem. Good idea. Go and rest at your mom's house. It'll do you good. You can take stock, reflect. I'm going to Rio with Sacha. What did you say? Brigitte, come out. We need to talk! I'm late. Leave the door! Stop, I said come out! Make up your mind. We'd like to go. - This is ridiculous! - Let go of me! Poor fool. He invited you to fuck you! No, you think? Right, make fun of me too. - We'll sort this out at home! - I don't take orders from you! - Leave me alone! - Brigitte, that's enough! This will end badly. Are you nearly done? Leave me be. I'm going to the hairdresser. Are you done making a show? What makes you think Sacha invited me to Brazil to fuck me? - Did you sleep with that old play-boy? - He's a very nice man. He's caring, takes me nice places, introduces me to people and is good in bed. - Slut! - Bastard! How dare you hit me? Bastard! Apologize, you jerk! It's true! With all you put me through! You show up with your mistress! You let me down at Sacha's! You disgust me! Calm down, darling! - Come on! - Let go of me! - Leave me alone! - Leave my husband alone! Sorry. I shouldn't have hit you. That was all my fault. I understand. You want revenge. You acted on a whim. But I swear I don't blame you. You'll see, it will all work out. Poor Jerome, you really take me for a fool. Those days are over. Sacha isn't the first, mind you. I also slept with Christian. That's not true? That isn't true! I'll beat the shit out of that scumbag! Darn! Bastard! Don't shit a brick because I fucked your wife. And you call yourself my friend? You disgust me. You hear? You disgust me! You should've taken care of your wife. - You cut? - This isn't the time, you see. When you got tired of Brigitte, you palmed her off to Sacha. You think I don't know your dirty tricks? What is this freak show? Nothing, a cuckold with some pep. How many times? How many times did you sleep with Brigitte? You're an idiot. You don't deserve your wife. She's a good girl, Brigitte. It was in her interest that I connected her to Sacha. So, are you opening? Sorry. Drop. - Call. - Call. - Call. - Card? Deal. One. How stupid of me! You wanted to be in the film in exchange, right? - Two cards. - Huh? You can go to hell! You understand? Go to hell! Speaking of your script? Well, Sacha didn't even read it. Didn't you even see that he was fooling you with that while he stole Brigitte? How stupid can you be? So, are you playing or not? Is he going to piss off any time soon? Natacha's right. You're a loser. A parasite! A second-class gigolo! Your Natacha was working for Madame Claude when Michel met her. Well, I think that's enough. Get the hell out, little man or I'll throw you down the stairs like you have never been down before! Go on, scram! No, look, I already told you to call before coming here. Sorry. I really need to talk to you. Okay, come in. What if we got married? No, I'm being serious! You're cute. Honestly, do you see us getting married? Well, why not? Anyway, I'm allergic to the idea of marriage. But you left the nutter because he wouldn't marry you. Michel is different! Yes, Michel is different. He's a real man, him. I'm a piece of shit! It's him that you want. That's it. Admit it! Admit it? Who are you to tell me I have something to admit? You should go home to your wife and kids. She's a really good woman. This is crazy! It's crazy how much you love it, all of you! You haven't slept with her as well, have you? - Jerome, you're boring. - You think I don't see your tricks? You used me to make Michel jealous. - You think? - Yes, I'm an fearless fool. I don't ask for a dime! I'll drive, wait while you flirt with clients. - Like that Arab! - Are you complaining? You got it free. Yes, I should've started there. - How much for a shot? - You can't afford it. Did you get it all off your chest? Leave. No, wait. I'm sorry. I lost it. Try to understand me. I love you, I need you. Jerome, stop. Jerome, that's enough. Stop. Jerome, I think you'd better go. Good evening. Brigitte! Brigitte! Brigitte, listen to me! I thought about it. It can't end like this. - I don't have time. - I love you. Listen, this is ridiculous! You stink of alcohol. I won't let you ruin our family! - Sacha's waiting for me. - I don't care. You're not leaving until you tell me you still love me! I'm begging for forgiveness. - Give me another chance. - You're ridiculous. Brigitte, don't leave me! You're all I have! Brigitte! I'm warning you, I'll shoot myself. - Who is it? - It's me, open up. Who? It's me. Open this damn door! Mrs. Ozendron told me not to open for anyone. I'm Mr. Ozendron. You won't stop me from coming into my own home! I don't know you, sir. She told me not to open for anyone! Damn it. Open this door or I'll break it down! Are you done? Shush! There are kids sleeping! Open this door! It's dad! Sorry, sir. She told me not to open to anyone. Yes. Are you okay, Patrick? Patrick! Aren't you going to say hello to dad? Dad came to give you a little kiss before bed. Leave me alone. You're mean to mommy. What's wrong, dad? Don't cry, daddy. I love you. I know you're not mean. Don't cry. Shit! Bastard! Maria! Maria! Gringo! My God! Chris! Darling, you're wounded! My love! No, no! Please, talk to me! No! I love you. I love you, Chris! Oh God, they've killed the love of my life. THE END It's not a bad ending. It seems to be working. In the end, that little jerk Chris isn't as bad as I thought. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Bye. - Hello. - Terrific! Super! - Bravo! - Thanks. Chris! Jerome, it's been a while! Yes, it'd be almost a year. You know, you're great, honestly. - Thank you. - Fantastic! - Bravo. - Thank you! I always knew you'd make your mark. It's a pretty good start for me now. Have you met my wife? - Chris! - Liliane. - It's me! - Darling! - How are you? - I'm fine. Hey, Jerome, did you see Natacha? She's with Michel. They're married now. Really? Well, she finally got her Michel. Look, Brigitte's over there! Brigitte! Liliane! Hello. Jerome! It's nice of you to come! Sacha must be happy. It's a success. - I think people loved it. - Yes. You look great. - And how are you? - Great. There's talk of me going commercial in the company. Really? Can you take the kids next week? I'm going to Marrakech with Sacha. Yes, of course. Brigitte, Sacha's looking for you. I'm coming. Jerome, my dear, how are you? Good. My best wishes to the newlyweds! Thanks. We didn't send out any announcements. Right. - Coming? - Coming. - Call me, if you want. - Of course. I've been working on my novel again. This time, I think it's serious. It'll work out, my dear. I'm sure of it! Goodbye. It's crazy how much better I feel since then. More relaxed, more comfortable. Being with her really works for me. It's true. If only she didn't have that face.
