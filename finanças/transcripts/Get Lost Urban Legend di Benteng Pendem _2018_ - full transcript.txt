Matters which concern the transfer of power... ...and other things... ...will be executed by careful means... ...and in the shortest possible time. Djakarta, the 17th of August, 1945. In the name of the people of Indonesia, Soekarno, Hatta. I am trying to run Run to find my dreams It is you. -How are you? -I am fine. You? -I am good. Let's go to class. -Let's go. Look. Hey, why are you always late? -Yeah, I gotta go. -Okay. -Where is the others? -I don't know. I am looking for them. The bell is gonna ring soon. There they are. Are you serious? -Hi, guys. -Hi, guys. -Hey. -Hello! -Sorry I am late. -Fatso. You are always eating. Guys, you all have got the permission, right? Yes. All done. Great. Okay, then. Where will we meet up later? After the first break, my car is at the front. Let's meet there. Okay. The bell is ringing. Let's go or Miss Rahma will scold us. -Let's go. -Let's go. What? Why is he crawling? Doesn't he know what time is it? Hey! God. What is going on? Why are you smiling? Go to your class! I will catch you! Wait. -Miss. -Where are you going? We just went to the restroom. Why are you bringing your bags? I just changed my pad. It would be embarrassing if I just carried it. That's right, Miss. Okay, then. -Okay. Excuse me, Miss. -Excuse me. -Let's go. -Let's go. Hi, sir. Sorry to bother you. Where are you going? I am... Hey! Jono! Jono! Miss Wulan might see us again. Walk faster. -I am sorry. -Be careful! Hurry up. Mr Jono is after me. -Let's go, then. -Hurry up. Jeez. Where is he? I am exhausted. I hate this! -We finally made it out. -Who planned it? Ringgo! -Yes, you are the best. -Ringgo! Yeah! Ringgo is the king! What are you planning when we arrive at Jogja? I am going to Borobudur. I can't wait to eat gudeg. I want to go to Kraton, Parangtritis. She wants to go shopping, right? -What about you? -Nasi kucing! I want nasi kucing, chicken intestine satay, and joss coffee. When I arrive at Yogyakarta, I want to go to Toba Lake. Toba Lake is in Medan. Ringgo! Show off. Shit. -This is not good. -Why? What is it? Please do not tell me you do not have license. Huh? Oh, no. What do we do? Okay, does anyone have a license to switch with him? I do not have one. I do not either. Oh, no. Okay, let's find another route. Let's turn around. Do you know another route? I don't, actually. -Just turn around. -Just try. -It is better than get caught. Okay? -Okay. Hey, wait. Where are we now? Just relax. I am sure if we take this road, we will find the main road. You are just a smart-ass. Have you ever taken this road? You haven't, have you? Well, never. But we have been in the woods for an hour. Nobody is here. Guys, just relax. Do not make Ringgo panic. Yeah, just relax. Ringgo is here for you. Trust in Ringgo. Yeah, just trust Ringgo. Okay. Hey. I feel something odd with the tires. Huh? I don't know. Is it odd? -Let's check it. Check it, Bombom. -Hold on. -Hold on. I will pull over. -I have to check it alone? What's wrong? Huh? What is it? -Flat tire. -Jeez. How did it get flat? Just change the tire, then. Move. What the hell. -Ringgo. -Huh? What is wrong with you? You never check your spare tire? Your spare tire is flat too. Are you serious? -What is wrong with you? -I am so sorry. My driver usually checks it. No wonder. Bombom. -Can you blow it up? -Watch your mouth. Blow it up. No need to argue. There is a tire repair shop over there. -Let's go there. -You are right. -Let's go. -We can reach it, right? -Yes, we can. -Of course, it is very near. Open it for me. No customer. So unexpected. -What can I help you? -I got a flat tire. -I see. -Can you repair it? -Which one? -The back tire. The left one. -Heavy. -Of course. You think you are light? I have never been in this area. Me too. This could take a long time, probably all day. Really? But you can fix it, right? -Just do it. -Right. The cost is 200,000 rupiah. What the hell? Are you crazy? Even in Jakarta, it is cheaper. It is very expensive. It is up to you. It is fine if you want it or not. You can go to a bodyshop ahead around three hours away. Do you want to go there? -How? It is three hours away. -What do we do? Okay, then. -Okay, as long as it can be fixed. -Right. You have to pay now. Do you have the money? Yes, how much? Check it first. -I just have 100,000 rupiah. -We need more. They are really weird. They haven't fixed it but already asking for payment. What a weirdo. They are also opportunists. What is it? I mean, there is no one here, so they are asking for crazy price. Right? Here it is. Like you asked. Right, since you will be waiting for so long, you better wait there, there is a waterfall. It is 200 meters away. It is good for taking pictures. That sounds fun. -Let's go there. -Okay. It is better than here. That sounds lovely. Hold on. Let me just take my bag. Can you take mine too? -Here it is. -Let's go. My clothes are in your bag, right? Yes. -Ready? -Let's go. -Alright. -Please fix it. -Thank you. -Thank you. I am trying to run Run to find my dreams That's crazy! That's absolutely crazy! Our trip is paid off! -It is exciting! -How about swimming? Right, let's swim. It will more exciting. Is it deep? -No, it is probably 2 meters deep. -Shit. If you jump, there won't be any water left. Stop it. Okay. But what if we swept away? It won't happen. Just swim around here. Okay. Yeah! Here we go! Crazy! Anton! Help Anton! Anton! Anton! Hey! Anton! What happened? What happened? Something pulled me in. Happy birthday. Wow! But my birthday was two days ago. Right, but I just got the present now. Is it okay? Of course, it is okay. Thank you. -Do you like it? -I like it a lot. Promise me, do not ever take this off... ...as long as we are together. I promise. Right, do you want to have dinner with me when we get back to Jakarta? Hey! Why are you looking at them like that? What are you talking about? Hey! Let's go back! Let's go back. Yeah! I think the car is ready! Let's go! -Let's go! -Let's go! -Let's go back. -What? Let's go back. Watch out. Be careful. Who pulled my foot? Who did that? Nobody. Exactly. What the hell. Nobody wants to admit it. I told you, maybe you slipped, and you felt like your foot was being pulled. I really felt it, something pulled my foot in. Why are you being so quiet? Bombom, did you call me when we were at the waterfall? No, why would I? Guys, hopefully the tire is fixed by now. It should be. Luckily we found the waterfall. What are you doing? Don't push me. Can you do it? You will fall. -There. It is not even close. -Just there? I am really tired. The waterfall was nice. So refreshing. -Finally. -So refreshing, isn't it? Absolutely. Hey, are we going the wrong way? -No. -No. Are you sure? -Of course. -Of course. It is the right way. -Is this right? -That... Where is the bodyshop? What? What? Where is my car? Where is my car? -My car... -Where is your car? Guys, the bodyshop was here, right? It was right here. The tire got flat right there. But how did the bodyshop go? Where is the car? Did it disappear? Are you sure it was here? I don't know. I had a feeling that they are bad people. What do we do? Man, my dad will be so mad. My dad will be so mad, man. Let's call someone for a help. We can ask for a help. -Hold on. -My dad will be so mad. There is no reception. -Me neither. -Me neither. Same here. What do we do? -Oh, my God. -Maybe we can find someone. Over there. Right? How do we get there? It is too far for us to walk. -We will be exhausted. -That's right. So? You want to wait here? Is that what you want? Until someone or a car passes by? Can't you see that nobody is here? I will walk there. I don't care about you. -Let's go. -My dad must be pissed, man. -I am coming. -Let's go. Jeez. How come there are no cars passing by? Right. I have a really bad feeling. Guys, I am very tired. Let's rest for a bit. I am also tired. Jeez, I really need to pee. -What a bother. -Let me just pee. -Okay, then. -Hurry up. Wait for me. -Don't be too long. -Don't be too long. -Yes, I hear you. -Hurry up, Bombom. Let's just sit. I have to find reception. -Did you get reception? -I don't know. -Oh, my gosh. -Oh, my gosh. -I am so sore. -Me too. -Nope. -No reception? Where should I pee? Jeez. I think I am going to pee there. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. I feel like someone was passing by. Sounds like there is a march. Hurry up, Bombom. Where is he? But seriously, this place is so empty. There is nobody. Isn't it your car, Ringgo? Hey! How rude! Do you know how expensive that car is? Hey! Hey! There is no one in there, right? There is no one in there, right? Hey! Oh, my gosh. Jeez, where are the people who is marching? Ouch! Shit. How could I fall? Ouch. Shit. What is this place? Ouch. Hurry up. How did that happen? I heard people marching. Where are they? Maybe over there. -That was crazy. -Shit. How can the car drive itself? It even tried to hit us. I don't get it. So, we cannot ride that car anymore? How can we ride a car that drive itself? I'd rather find another ride. -What? -What? It looks like a building. What building is that? -I see that one. -Let's check it. -Let's check it. -Let's go. Watch out. Slowly. It is slippery. Here. Watch out. It is slippery. It is slippery here. Wow. What is this place? It is so spooky. I am scared. I am curious. Let's just go in. Me too. Let's go. Hey, hold on. Let's just go back. I am scared. This place is so spooky. What if something happens to us? Relax. It will be fine. We are here. We have to find Bombom anyway. Right. Let's go. Let's go with me. This always happens. Where did he go to find toilet? -No idea. -No idea. He is big, but hard to find. Jeez. Bombom! Bombom. There he is. Hey, Bombom. Why did you take so long? I am sorry. I slipped and fell. And look at me now. Shit. By the way, what is this place? Why is it kinda creepy? I think this building was a fortress. That is right. Because I heard people marching. -What? -What? Are you hallucinating? It is a deserted place. How could there be people marching? Did you hit your head? Nobody believes me. It is true though. From what I am seeing, this place seems haunted. Stop it. Let's just look around. Come on. Let's go. Hey, guys. What year is this fortress from? No idea. It is so good for taking photos. You are always thinking about taking photos, Vina. We are lost right now. I have an idea. Rather than walking around until night in these woods, we better spend the night here. We can continue our journey tomorrow. What do you think? I agree. It will be dark soon anyway. Let's go. -What are you waiting? Let's go in. -Okay. Let's go. Come on, Nadia. Hey, don't push. Excuse me. Wow. -Wow. -The chains are so big. Ouch! Watashiwa no, imara men. -What did you say? -Show off. Okay, guys, let's just stay here. Sounds good. I will look around first. Maybe there is a better place for us to sleep. Okay. I will go with you. -Okay, let's go. -Hey, please be careful. -Okay. -Be careful. No worries. Give me my food, Vina. Right. No wonder my bag is so heavy. Here it is. Eat! You are lucky it is just my food. Imagine if my body was in there. Heavy, right? You talk too much. I am thirsty. That's it. -Here it is. -Luckily you brought food. We would starve here otherwise. Oh, my gosh. Right, luckily Bombom brought food. You would be hungry otherwise. Do you think there is electricity in this fortress? I think there is. Look. There are still lamps on the walls. Right. It means we just have to find the panelboard, right? Yes, but where should we find it? I don't know either. I just got here. I forgot. Okay, just look for it while we walk. Maybe we will find it. Right, try your phone. Does it still have battery? Check it. Thirty percent. Thirty percent? Shit, we have to hurry, then. I feel bad for the girls. They must be scared of the dark. Let's go. Instead of going to Jogja, we ended up here. I know, right? We should have been in the hotel by now with comfortable bed and AC, not in a place like this. Just be patient. I bet you have never been on an adventure like this. We are supposed to be happy when on a vacation, Bombom. Enjoying ourselves. We are not on a vacation. We skipped school. That is enough. No need to fight. How can you fight here? Nadia. Was your phone on low battery? What's wrong with my phone? It was not on low battery. Why did it die? Hold on. It is on again. -On again. -Good. -We are lucky. -It is on. What a strange phone. Jeez. Where is Ringgo and Anton? Hopefully we can remember the way back. You remember it, right? This is the sign. Where is it? I think it is over there. -Let's go there. -Let's go. Shit, this place is so big. I know, right? Hey, I think the panelboard is over here. -Really? -Yes. Where is it? Just find it. I am trying to find it too. -It is warm here. -Why this place is spooky? What is it? Here it is! Yes! Try to turn it on. Turn it on. Thanks, God. It is finally on. -What happened? -I think it is old. Try to turn it up and then turn it down again. -Turn it down? -Turn it up again. -Turn it down again. -Yeah! Thanks, God. -The light is on. -It is on. Okay, let's go back. I feel bad for the girls. -What year is this from? -Let's go. Come on. It is spooky. I just see it now. Let's go. Hurry up. -Wait. -Not bad. Look. Bombom! What is that? So scary. Isn't that jailangkung? How is there a jailangkung here? I found it in the corner. I think someone played it here. But from what I see, this place is perfect to play jailangkung. -Are you crazy, Bombom? Throw it away! -No! We can play this when we are bored. Just wait for Ringgo and Anton now. What are you doing? Wow. Isn't it jailangkung? -That's right. -Fun! Do you believe in something like that? Hey, let's play jailangkung. I bet you all have never played it. I don't want to. I have never played it. That's why we can try a new experience... ...by playing jailangkung. We will have a new experience. Do you know how to play it? Of course I know. Just say this. "Jelangkung, Jelangsat." "We have a small party here." "Come uninvited, go undelivered." Let's prove it. -Let's play. -Okay? -Just prove it. -Come on. -Let's play. -Okay. Come on. No, I don't want to. You guys can play. Don't be like that. Let's play together. No, I am not doing it. You guys can play. -You are no fun. -You are no fun. I will just wait here. Let's play. Just leave her be. -Let's play. -Okay, then. How do we play? Guys, hold this and never let this go. After that, I will read the mantra and you guys repeat after me. -Okay. -Okay? Let's start. Jelangkung, Jelangsat. We have a small party here. Come uninvited, go undelivered. Jelangkung, Jelangsat. We have a small party here. Come uninvited, go undelivered. Did you move it, Bombom? No. It was probably Ringgo. Why me? Was it you, Anton? I didn't do that. I swear. Sorry. What is your name? What are you doing, Bombom? Are you asking for an introduction? You are crazy. It is okay. I am curious. Is it going to answer? -Seruni. -Seruni. If we may ask, how old are you? Eighteen years old. Seruni, where do you live? How... ...did you die? By whom? Guys... I think you should see this. -What? -Look. What? Where is it? Where did it go? Wait. It was here just now! I saw a Japanese soldier behind you. Okay, babe, relax. You just saw it on your phone. -Look in front of you. -I saw it clearly! Look, there is no soldier, right? But, guys, I am wondering why the jailangkung threw itself away, and stuck to the wall. I think this place is too scary for us to stay. We should find another place that is safer. I couldn't agree more. That jailangkung is getting more scarier. Let's go. Okay. We better find another place. Don't leave anything behind. Go grab all your belongings. Don't leave anything behind. Let's go. -Everything's ready? -Come on. Ouch! Watch out. Slowly. The water is getting deeper, right? Yes. Guys, where should we stay? I think that is an old room. There is a bed. Let's just stay here. Shit. I sense something strange. Oh, my gosh, Nadia. You know this is an old fortress. What do you expect? You talk so much! Stop it. Let's just come in and get some rest. We can go tomorrow. Why is that so difficult? -Come on. -You know this is a fortress. We will definitely sense something strange. What's important is that we are together. Come on. It is not bad. Let's just get some rest here. This will do. -Do you want me to put your bag away? -Here. What's wrong? I need to pee. -You need to pee? -Yes. Do you want me to go with you? No need. I can hold it. You will be in pain. It's okay. I can hold it. I will just sleep it off. Let's go to sleep. Yuck! It is very dirty. Jeez. Shit. What's wrong, Vina? I need to pee. Me too. Let's go together. Sure. Where can we pee? Vina. Do you know where the toilet is? It is usually at the corner. Let's go there. Okay, let's go. Vina! The lights! Why is this happening? Let's just go back, Vina. I am scared. We are already halfway through, Nadia. I really need to pee, Nadia. What if I wet myself? I am really scared. Please, Vina. The toilet is near. It is over there. -Oh, my gosh. -Come on. Let's just go back, Vina. Just go with me, Nadia. I need to pee. Let's just go. Aryo, I am scared. I promise, I will never betray you. Hopefully this war will end soon, and we can be together forever. Where is it, Vina? Hey, I think it is over here. That is the sign. -You can go first. -Wait for me here. Where else can I go? I need to pee too. Do not go anywhere. I am scared. Alright. Wait here. Nadia? Hurry up. I need to pee. Okay, I will be right out. -You can go inside. -Alright. Be careful. Huh? Nadia? Where did she go? Nadia? Did she go back first? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Why did you leave me? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Where did you go, Nadia? Please don't make me feel scared. Nadia? Nadia? Wake up, Anton. Bombom. Hey! What is it? What is it, Ringgo? I am still sleepy. Is it morning? Where is Vina and Nadia? Since when did they they go missing? I don't know either. I just woke up too. What? Okay, let's go find them, then. Let's go. Guys. Where should we find them? There are so many paths. We better split up. It will be faster. I don't want to be alone. Okay, then. You can go with Anton. I will go alone. Why can't I go with you? Hey, Fatty, you are lucky I am willing to go with you. And you are complaining? Okay, stop it. You guys go to the left, and I go to the right, okay? -Come on. -Alright. Hurry up. -Okay. Be careful. -Be careful, Ringgo. Bye. -Vina? -Nadia? -Vina? -Vina? Nadia? Where did they go? Bombom. Where do you think they are going? Well, I don't know either. Maybe they were taken in their sleep. It could be. Both of them are coward. So, it is impossible for them to go out alone without us... ...in this kind of place. Am I right? Where are you, Vina? Anton. Listen. I hear footsteps. Footsteps? You are right. There are footsteps. Wait. -It is getting closer. -Are you serious? -It is getting closer. -Are you serious? -Yes. -What do we do now? -Let's run away from here. -Let's go. Bombom... I can't move my legs. Bombom! Me too. I can't move my legs. What should we do, Anton? -Anton! -Just surrender. Just close your eyes, Bombom! Close your eyes! Hey, Anton. They are gone. I can move my body now. -Is it okay now? -Yes. -I can move my legs too! -Let's go, Anton. Let's get out of here. Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Anton! Anton! Wait for me! Wait for me, Anton! Where are you going? Hey! Wait! There is someone there. -Help! -Help! Help! Let's just go there, then. Come on, Anton. What's with you? I can't even fit in that hole, let alone you with your big body. Shit, what do we do? I am really scared, Anton! Okay, then. Let's take that way. Hopefully there will be a way out. -Let's go! -Okay, come on! Shit, it is a dead end. Where is Nadia? Who are you? What are you doing here? Stop, Bombom. Thank goodness. We should look for them somewhere else. Let's go, Bombom. Let's just go. There is nothing here. Come on. Come on, Bombom! Let's get out of here! Bombom! -Hold on. Hold on! -What is it? Look, Anton. How can a mummy bleed, Anton? Ghosts don't bleed, right? -Check it out. -Anton... Open it, Bombom. Vina... Vina! Vina! Vina. Vina! Vina is dead. -Vina is dead, Anton! -Vina! Vina! Vina... Vina... Vina! Vina! Forgive me, Vina. Vina! Vina! Forgive me, Vina. Vina... I didn't do it on purpose, Vina. Forgive me, Vina. Forgive me, Vina. Vina! Vina! Vina! Run, Bombom! Run! Help! Wait for me, Anton! Anton! Ouch! Hurry up, Bombom. Hurry up. Anton! Anton! Wait for me, Anton! Anton! Anton! Help! Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia? Nadia. Oh, my gosh. We are looking for you. Nadia. Nadia! Let's get out of here. Ringgo! -You are here? -Yes. Where have you been? Huh? I was looking for you. -Are you okay? -I am fine. -Are you alright? -I am okay. Let's get out of here. Come on. Oh, my gosh. Are you okay? I am fine. Jeez. Where is your bracelet? What bracelet? Who are you? Who the hell are you? It is me, Aryo. Aryo? Who is Aryo? Aryo. I am Seruni. Aryo... I am afraid. Don't be scared. I promise, I will always take care of you. I promise I will never betray you. Me too. I will never be able to leave you. And once we are free from here, we will get married. Are you serious? Hopefully, this war will end soon, and we can be together forever. I hope so too. What do you want? Hey! Hey! Let her go! -Let her go! -Let me go! Seruni! Aryo! Aryo... Aryo... Let me go! Let me go! Aryo! Aryo!
