You are? - You know, you should probably text your Aunt Scotty and tell him you can't make it to the baseball game today. Wait a second. - Okay, look, Scotty and I, we're not-- - Oh, come on, Becca. - I mean-- - It's the worse-kept secret in town. Now, that is saying a lot. Go on. Get outta here. Go have some fun. Thanks, Dr. Dutten. [Man on P.A. system, indistinct] [crowd cheering, applauding] Well, I don't care what the calendar says. Opening day-- That's the first day of spring. No, no, no. The sheriff never pays for coffee. Well, that's kind of you, Ben. But the principal still has to pay his parking tickets. [chuckles] - Start him a tab. - Yes, sir. [cheering continues] Kid throws fast. Just like he drives. Nice pitch, Scotty. [Man] Come on, man! Come on, guys! Strike two! Whoo! Yeah! Center field. Oh, Jesus Christ. [Man] Hey, Tommy! - Stay there. - What's he doing? - Boys, get in the dugout. - Move it off. - Get off! - Bring it in. Bring it in. - Get them off the field. - [Man shouting] Get them in the dugout, Principal. Rory. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, Rory, we got a ballgame going on here. We're playing ball, and you come out with a gun? What the hell are you doing? Aw, Ror. You're drunk, that's all. All right? Let's just lay the gun down. Rory, lay the gun down. Hmm? Lay it down. Hell, Rory, come on. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Rory? [crowd murmuring] Now, you lay that gun down. Rory? [crowd gasping] Oh, my God. [chattering] [radio chatter] [Man] I'll have blood alcohol for you in the morning. [door opens] A full tox screen will take about a week. [door closes] How are you holding up, David? Peggy here yet? She just walked in with her boy. David, perhaps now is not the best time. Son, settle down. - Hey, Curt. - [stifled whimper] Uh... I'm so sorry. I liked Rory. I liked him a lot. What was he doing out there? He had been drinking, that's all. Rory quit two years ago. You know how proud he was of that. Is that what you're saying, that he was drunk? - Is that what you're telling people? - No. That you had to do it-- had to shoot the town drunk. [scraping in distance] [scraping continues] You did the right thing. I need a new blade for this. Hey, David. You did the right thing. You should be sleeping. [phone ringing] [Man] Sheriff's Department. No, ma'am, we can't comment on that. That's an ongoing investigation. No, ma'am, the sheriff is not here right now, but I can see if the deputy will-- - Amateur. - [phone ringing] Sheriff's Department. Mm-hmm. That's the medical examiner on line two. Morning, Jim. What have we got? The toxicology reports are in. The results are negative. - Come again? - There was no alcohol-- No, I heard what you said, Jim, but that's not right. - Rory was-- - David, we did the test twice. Rory wasn't drunk. There was no alcohol in his bloodstream. We'll get the drug results back in a couple of days, maybe a week. Yeah, okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. [Man on police radio] Do you want this car... [Man #2 on radio] Bring it down here. Ben? Ben! Hey. - Hey, Ben. Ben! - [snapping fingers] - Ben! - [gasps] Hey. You all right? [sighs] Don't worry. The, uh... kids are resilient. They're gonna be all right. - Yeah. - [school bell ringing in distance] I'm late. I gotta go. - Deardra. Bill. - Hey, Judy. Little man. How y'all doing? Uh, would you mind taking a look at Bill? - Sure. What's wrong? - I don't know. He's just-- He's not right. [air hissing] How are you feeling, Bill? Any pain or discomfort? Bill? She worries too much. I'm fine. Just a little tired. You got any plans this weekend? She worries too much. I'm fine. Just a little tired. His vitals are fine. But, you know, I've gotta see a patient in Cedar Rapids on Monday. I wanna take Bill in to get a CT scan. - Monday? - Yeah. Let's just make sure it's nothing serious. - Okay. - Okay? You need me, you call me. Day or night. - Okay? - Thanks, Judy. - [taps hood] - See you, Nicholas. - [Nicholas] Bye, Judy. - Bye, Bill!

All right, team. Get me some power. - Oh, my God. - The garage is lit up, too. - Deardra! - Tom, they get out? Not Deardra and Nicholas. Just Bill. - I need two men on that Engine 3 quarter, south side. - On it.

How long has he been playing statue? [David] A couple hours now. The same look Rory gave me. The same goddamn look. [phone ringing] [scoffs] Shit. [Russ] Sheriff's Department. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Slow down. [Jim] Been there at least a week by the looks of things. I'll check to see if there's any identification. - [blows nose] - Yeah. Do that. Boys, last I checked, hunting season ended three months ago. We was just out taking in a little nature. - Fresh air is all. - Guns away till fall. - Aw, come on, Sheriff. - What, are you kidding me? - What's with this guy? - Well, we got us a pilot. Where's the plane? You know, last week, Travis Quinn was going around saying he heard something crash out by Hautman Bog. - I didn't think nothing of it. - On account of him being full of shit? As a general rule. - Well, maybe there's the exception. - Maybe. [Russ] You said it sounded like a plane, Trav? Sheriff, about the reward-- Shit. Big plane? Little plane? What? Come on now. If you can explain the difference how those two sound, - I might be able to figure it out. - You're full of shit. He's full of shit. People only ask for a reward when there's something to find. Is it gonna be a big reward, Sheriff? Travis, you ask about that again, I'm gonna throw you out of the fucking boat. You're not gonna shoot me? Travis. Yeah? Kill the engine. [engine stops] It was a big plane, Russ. Why is that? 'Cause we're right on top of it. [radio chatter] Kevin, which way does the water flow through town? Nice to see you, too, Dave. Waste water or drinking? - Drinking. - Give me a second. A plane that size goes down-- nothing in the paper, nothing in the news. - Make any sense to you? - It depends on what the payload is. Exactly what I'm thinking. Which is what? Hautman Bog-- What's that drain into? - Dwyer Creek. - Which drains into? Black Pond. Oh, hey, you remember monster catfish-- Russell, where do you think we get our drinking water from? Treated water comes in from the north, breaks east-west. And what house does it get to first? Uh, let's see. Rory Hamill. You wanna shut off the entire town's water supply on a hunch? Mayor, I've got three dead bodies in the morgue in the last 48 hours. David, take a look around you. This is a farming community. It is springtime. It is planting season. You turn off the water, you're gonna kill the crops. You kill the crops, and you bankrupt every family in Pierce County. And that is not based on some, uh, hunch. That's a fact. Water stays on. Uh, Sheriff, I'm all for a little civil disobedience, but, um, I think this one might cost you your job. You know what, Russ? That wouldn't be such a bad thing. What the fuck? Shh. Hang on a second. Well, is he dead? Well, if he is, he won't mind waiting. [screaming] Oh! Jesus Christ! Did we or did we not request a transfer for him this morning? Mm-hmm. - [busy signal] - [dialing] God damn it. - [busy signal] - [dialing] - Even better. - [receiver clatters] [typing] - You know what? - What? We're in trouble.

Judy-- Hey, don't touch me. - Hey! - Both of you, out! Let's go. Keep moving, please. - Go ahead. This way, please. - [David] Judy, what does it mean? - They're checking for elevated temperatures. - Clear. Farnum was bleeding from the nose. So was Rory. Well, cerebral hemorrhaging-- It's gotta be some kind of virus. - You gotta wait here. - Look, I'm a sheriff. - She's a doctor. We know these people. - Clear. Would you just tell us what's going on?

Another 20 to Quik Phil's from there. - I'm fine. - Good. Let's go. [Judy] They took my blood. Ran at least one test that I saw. What if the reason they didn't let me go is because I have it? You're pregnant. That's why you have a fever. David, you can't know that for sure. I can, and I do. If you're sick, I'm sick. We drank from the same tap. And I'm not sick. None of us are.

All's they said is that there'd been some sort of accident. My whole unit got flown in. We didn't even know what state we was in till we seen the license plates. [radio chatter] Am I gonna die without my mask on? Is that what they told you-- If you took your mask off, you were gonna die? They just said to keep it on. Look, um, I know I don't deserve any favors from you people, but if you let me go, I swear to God I won't say nothing. I didn't sign up to shoot unarmed civilians. - I'll just leave, okay? - Sit down. - Put the gun down, Russ. - Chief... I'm a sheriff. That's my deputy. Look, my wife's a doctor. She's pregnant. - Becca here is not even 18. - [Russ] When he blabs, they'll find us. If we don't let him go, they'll find us for sure. And besides, he's not gonna blab. No, sir.

A massive fire in Ogden Marsh continues to rage, and high winds are preventing fire teams from containing the deadly blaze. Now, information is still coming in, but what we currently know: An explosion rocked the Dakon Petrol chemical plant early this morning, with eyewitness reports of a 400-foot fireball that lit up the sky. We also have reports of a second explosion at a nearby truck fueling station. A perimeter has been set in an effort to contain the blaze, and civilians are not being permitted into that area.
