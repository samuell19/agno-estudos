Constantin Film presents a production of Constantin Film in coproduction with zero one film THE POOL Morning. Morning. Move! Girl fight! - Naked? - No, hijabs. Move it! You called us. - Never ever. - Emergency call. Put your dick sticks away. Come back when you have tits. - No, no! - This pool is women only. Look, somebody called us. 'NOW! Half hour: 2.50! - Hello there. - You call us? Yeah, snack time. Yummy pork sausages. Want a taste? I don't see any fight. If anyone here fights, it's me. - The lifeguard? Where is he? - She. - What? - She. He, she, who cares? Where is he? Steffi, we need you here! You're the lifeguard? And you're the policeman? - Where's the fight? - I got it all under control. Come on, Steffi! All I can say is: "athlete's foot". - Spread out! - And the sausages? Move! - What fight? - No clue. And the athlete's foot wasn't my fault. Whoops. - Looks quiet. - Must be somewhere. - Caution! Hijab. - Where are they? - Who? - The other hijabs fighting. Mine's not a Hijab. It's Herm√©s. Grace Kelly wore it in that film... - "To Catch a Thief". - Exactly. - Audrey Hepburn did too... - So you weren't fighting? Not me. Let's go. It's so humid in Germany! You wanted to come here. No way! I'm not lying next to a German. You're so embarrassing. Stop arguing. What's this all about? Uh... the weather. So... You weren't fighting? Hitting? We are a family, Mr. Policeman. Who called the cops? That's racial profiling. Just because of the hijabs. - There are more and more of them. - Did you call the cops? It was you. Sometimes you surprise me. That's not like you. - Some people change over the years. - But not for the better. They have to follow our rules here. - Like not peeing in the pool. - For example. I do sometimes. Don't you? Eva. Really? I've been swimming in your pee for years? You never swim. - Have a good day. - Bye. Is he coming over here? Great, Gabi. Great. I always have my ID on me. It's you... Eva Kaiser. The singer. - Meeting you here... wild! - Yes. No need to let everyone know. I'd have no peace at all. I had you in my bedroom for ages. On a poster. Not too active lately, huh? That'll be 2.50. Yeah, sure. Got it. - 2.50. - Thanks. Thank you. You're impossible. Ah, peace and quiet. That one looks done. - Think she still has her sausage? - You bigot. Maybe a breakfast sausage. - No banger. - More like a Vienna. - That's 5 euros. - 5?! Yep. No diving! How long? 6140. Slower than yesterday. Take a break! - Swimming is my break. - From what? You wouldn't know. You're always on a break. No... She's so unnatural in that. Even walks differently. So confined. I think it's sexy. Like Superwoman. Bullshit, Gabi. It's not sexy at all. It's the opposite. What's it saying? That she belongs to a man. Pure repression. - Maybe she likes belonging to him. - Huh? - What is wrong with you? - With me? What's wrong with you? That's what we demonstrated for? To go back in time? - No, you went mostly because of Lothar. - Oh, please. Lothar. You always thought he was hot. - And what was your guy's name again? - Jean Pierre. - Jean Pierre. - The tall guy. Thin as asparagus. So was his... Yasemin! Come over to your family! - What is your daughter wearing? - No idea. - What are you all doing here? - What are you doing here? You're not in class? What's with this rubber tubing? Think it looks nice? Are you on a Muslim marriage website or what? You have to look attractive for men. - You're no spring chicken. - Are you serious? Oh, child. You look so Arabic. Not pretty at all. You don't need that. Oh, she's really uppity. Now they're covering up their little girls. Old women, okay. But no one chooses to wear a scarf in this heat. It scares me. Oh, calm down. Gabi, dear... Chill! I forgot my sunscreen. Would you... There's not much I can't do myself, but putting lotion on my back even I can't do. Swimming for the Emirates now? No, for ISIS. Right, your whole caliphate's here. Careful what you say. They see and hear everything. This was the only place I had some peace and quiet. I think having them as a family would be nice. They're all yours. - Another time. - It's now or never. Or they'll be at our place for 3 more weeks. Sorry, gotta work. - Hi, Rocky. - Hey, go on in. - Hello. - Morning. Two please. - Here. - Thanks. Hi, how much? 5 for the day, 3 for half, 2 for two hours. - Morning. - Hey, Emma. What's up? - What'll it be? - I just wanted to say hello to someone. Short hello? Long hello? I don't know yet. - Then we start with 2 euros. - Okay. Hi, Christel. I'm Paula. We're in the same seminar. I lent you my charger yesterday. - I didn't give it back? - You did. Where do you sunbathe? She doesn't. She just swims. Correct. Now, into the sun with your delicious body. Or afraid you'll turn to dust? - A bikini? - Sure. Show her what you've got. Oh, God! The I'm better than you number. We're a thorn in her side. Whores. Who? Us? Pure provocation, Gabi. She wants us veiled too. That's what she wants. - Forced veiling? - Yes. Not with me! What are you doing? She doesn't even see you. - You're blocking my lane. - Your lane? I've been swimming here for 30 years, honey. But you're not swimming. Aqua Fit for seniors is Mondays. - A senior? I'm no senior. - Is that so? Do I have to put up with this full body condom? Do I have to put up with this nudist grandma here? No going topless in the pool! What? Since when? Since always. Out! Steffi, get down here! - We'll see about this. - Yeah, we will. Out! Have you gone crazy? - We have rules. For everyone. - Are you gaga? Some people have to learn the hard way. Think they're real? Can you zoom in? Really pretty. - I warned you. - Stupid bitch. - That was age discrimination. - You're not old. I look in the mirror now and see my mother. Gotta be fearless. Or at least dress well. The best candy always has the finest wrapping. Oh, so now you, too. You're a pawn of lslamization. I don't believe it. Why do they always have to grill? That awful smell! - I'd complain. - Then say something. I don't care but your baby is about to jump out of the buggy. You stay in there. Don't get Mommy in trouble. Nice pareo. From Istanbul? - No, from Munich. - Really? Where do you find pareos like that in Munich? I've traveled a lot with Udo, my husband. The bazaar in Istanbul is fabulous. The selection, the colors. - It looks good on you. - Thanks. Her Hijab is very nice. I don't mind but... grilling here is prohibited. Prohibited... Everything in this country is prohibited. But a baby when you're 60 isn't? I'm not 60 yet. And that's not a baby. Uh... it is a baby, but not mine. - You kidnap it? - What? Please excuse my mother. Sorry. Why do you constantly apologize? You do. It's perverse... What happened? That old woman thought I was 60. - What? - You don't have to rub it in! No grilling! Fire hazard. Why? I told you. Those are the rules here. Do you want us to starve? Tell that person at the grill we don't eat pork. You're kidding me? Kim! It's racist to just have pork. Did they say that? Racist? Racist. You don't want them to go to paradise? Your call. Only if they eat them. But they're not. Oh, someone's drowning. Go! You're a pain. As a teacher you can retire at 60. Stop. I dread it already. All day alone with Udo, I'd be scared, too. I have Louie. Oh, my Louie... Where is my Louie? Mommy has a treat for you. Yes, she does... Wow, she really ought to cover that up. They have such nice pareos. She looks like jello. Whenever we'd have jello, Mom would shake the bowl and ask, "Who's this?" And we'd say, "Grandma." She was just as fat. There goes the jello. - You really think that's funny? - Yes. Why are you always so critical? Her body is her own. Yes and she owns a lot. Come on, that old cliche. "My body is my own." And who owns your body? Well, Udo. And God. - Oh, God! - My body is my temple. For Udo and God. Yeah, right! You used to be wild yourself. Used to be"? Aren't you getting tired of it? Of what? Of being sexy? A woman over 50 can be beautiful, cool, elegantly dressed. But sexy? Oh, no. It's not fitting. Everyone freaks. Past menopause you can't be sexy anymore. Might as well hang a sign around your neck: "Temple closed." Social distancing? Sure. - My ears! - It's nice. A muezzin. - A zeppelin? - A muezzin! - Where is it? - Turn it off! - Wait. - Please turn it off. Come on, help us. You turn it off. Turn it off! I think it's kind of deep. - "Deep"? - Well, it's the call to prayer. So it's deep. I think it is. That deep, too? - I didn't mean to offend you. - Don't sweat it. You can't. - Come on! - Now! Turn that thing off now! What's that? They're closing. That's it. Time to go. The're throwing us out? Right, Grandma. They're throwing you all out. So pack up. What's she saying? Pack up. The pool's closing. And go to Emine's tiny place with no air conditioning? Come on, help. You, you, you and you, as well as me We don't want freedom That's an abstraction Even old white men Can't get satisfaction We all have so many inhibitions Because of so many traditions We try to look cool But where is that at? - What's that all of a sudden? - It's not sudden. You don't wear it when you leave the house in the morning. I don't get it. I didn't bring you up like that. Yes, you did. "Do your thing and be free." This is my thing. Clear rules set me free. - Live in my house, I make the rules. - I'll move out. - Fine. About time. - Since Dad left, you're a wreck. Since he left, I can breathe. Why did you stop singing? You can sing till you drop. A lot of them do. What? Don't you have a locker room this year? I'm letting go of needless things. Beause Rocky upped the prices again? I don't need one. You can use mine. Will we ever achieve it, let's try if we don't, let's ask ourselves why Where is the freedom... Out! - We're closing. - Bye. Have a nice evening. I don't want you using my song as the closing track all the time. Why not? It works. - Don't get sassy! - Need help? - Not from you, burkini slut. - Okay, boomer. Didn't go so well? It wasn't the bikini's fault. It looks great. Says who'? He never said that. - Bye. - See you. Want a downer? You're doing great. You're the boss. You show them! Oh, girl... It's beautiful so empty. Kamila, are you paying? Kamila... Can someone figure out eleven times 20 euros? 20".each. - No children discount? - Who cares? - Two, please. - 3 euros each. PORK SAUSAGE AND LAMB Baa... Lamb. Sure there are no men here? How about here? Syrians. They're everywhere in Turkey. Did they fall from the sky like coal? - Where did they come from? - Keep it down. Want your daughter to end up like them? The air is stuffy. So humid! - Morning, Rocky. - Eva. - What's up today? - Nothing. Why? - Look... David. - You said Stallone. Another time. I couldn't find him. But David... i met him on a TV show. It was great. What a crazy evening. We sang "Freedom" together. - What we have in common. - 15. It's worth 20. "Baywatch", your line of work. Okay. That's for last week. Come on, 20... I don't have cash on me. I'll die of thirst. Tap water. You think biceps like men's are nice? I think muscles are nice no matter what bones they're on. Morning, Louie. Still kicking? Yes. - Morning. - Morning, Gabi. What did Udo get for dinner? I did cook. Strips of turkey, basmati rice and corn salad. And for dessert, strawberries and whipped cream. They're under our mushroom. So where do we go? We'll show them. - Here. - Let's go somewhere else. - No, right here. - Oh, God. Why are they sitting in our shade? They're desert people. They're used to no shade. Don't look. - Oh, my God. - What is it? She has the new Gucci model. What? A Gucci. "I carried the watermelon." Nice. - You got some support. - Support? - How so? - Because they're... You don't think it's their choice? I feel sorry for them. They're victims of patriarchy. Definitely. You're going in the water like that? Where are you going? - Swimming. - You can't swim. - What are you doing? - I want to swim too. Teach me. Please come out. This is embarrassing. Really. Now! I took you to so many different swimming lessons, lifeguard training, every week. Now it's your turn to help me. See, hopeless. Out! Come back out! See that pool? Go over there. You're in the way here. Come on! That's it. - I've just about had it. - What now? Are you blind? They've been staring at us the whole time. You can't even tell with them. In our culture, women show their faces. Yes, but... Under those things, you don't see if someone is thin or fat, young or old. How big or small their boobs are. Are you crazy? It's all religion motivated. Invented by men. Veils are an attack on us. On you. And me. But if I say it I'm intolerant and a racist. I never said "intolerant". Your sunscreen... You know, it's... It's not about us. It's a matter of principle. That's the difference. We stand for enlightenment. For women's rights. For freedom. - Gonna start demonstrating again? - For a secular state. What's that again? You're the teacher. Separation of church and state. - For Christ's sake! - Yes, but I'm for crosses in schools. And police stations. You're a moron. - A mirror. Wait a second. - Awesome. - Check out the eyeliner. - Super. I think she likes me. She was really jealous. - Of an Arab chick? - Yeah. - A delicious lamb sausage? - You have lamb today? - Yes. - Then I'll take... four. - Coming right up. - Maybe some jello too? Pardon? I'm sorry, I didn't mean for you to hear that. - I didn't want to offend you. - Offend me? Oh, no. You can't. My body isn't my problem at all, it's your problem. This bikini is new and I think it's so cool. I love it. And you want to spoil it for me? I haven't heard such un-feminist shit in ages. What do want me to say? Your body isn't my problem. This body has been through 35 years of periods. An abortion, two miscarriages, and menopause. And every clay I'm glad it's still holding up. Later, snowflake. - 16 euros. - 16? Yeah, the Arabs are driving prices up. Thanks. This is unsanitary. What a pity. The lovely lamb sausages. No, thanks. Why don't they want them? They're right next to the pork. And I thought it was because of me. In Arabia they'd behead someone like you. The water is ice cold. Is the water cold? Excuse me... - Not for me. - Far too cold. Steffi, what is this? They're all in burkinis. Burkinis aren't banned in Germany. Court ruling, 2019. "Ban would violate equality." But there's no room for me. - Do something. - Sorry, I can't. - I'm a minority here. - Use the other ladder. But I'm a regular here. Oh, God. And that's not allowed?! Street clothes in the pool. Do your job! - What do I pay you for? - You? It's unsanitary. There are babies in there. There'll be another epidemic. And it'll be your fault! Like the athlete's foot last year. Steffi wants to force me into a burkini. That's ridiculous. She'll get to know the real me. I used to be the 'it' girl of Munich. I know that. And I'm not going to go on watching women be oppressed. - It's none of my business. - It is your business. I'm fighting for you too. But you don't care. - It's not that I don't care. - Then join me. For freedom. - Why are you so angry? - Are you for solidarity or not? Thank you. She's finally cracking down. Our Swiss chocolate opportunist. What? What do you want? - What's that all about? - What is she saying? I don't understand either. Sorry, they were impossible. They said they'll swim in clothes as long as you two go topless. You better put something on. They said it's unbearable. Seeing you two every day. They said you're old. Repulsive even. Disgusting. "Disgusting"? They said that? Yeah, among other things. Gross! Where is the freedom? The freedom that's real Who really knows freedom? Who has the real deal? - You used to have a super body. - You too. - Are you okay? - Yes. No, don't! Yes, I'm okay. Do you need... money? I'm subletting a room. Who to? A college student from Berlin. - An aquatic person. - What's that mean? Was on his application. Please stay a little. I don't want to bump into those sexists. I might lose it. I hate this song. - I hated it even then. - What? It was number one for 38 weeks. Why are naked women "disgusting"? - Eva looks terrific. - For her age maybe. But... I just don't want to see it. The deterioration... Those old bodies. I've been dissatisfied with my body all my life. Something's always wrong. I want it to be perfect. From head to toe. But I'm slowly starting to think that ain't gonna happen. That I'll never like it 100 %. Know what I mean? I hate my thighs. Yeah, look... They're somehow... - Weird. - Why? - They are. They're so... - What? They're normal. When I see a photo of myself, from ten years ago, or five, I think, "You looked hot back then." But even back then I thought I looked like shit. LAM B SAUSAGE ONLY Well? Satisfied with me? - Sunscreen! - Right! - The usual. - This has got to stop. Why? We've always clone it like this. - Your baby is haram now. - Louie is haram now? He always was. He was always haram. "Taboo, cursed, forbidden." I see... the Arabs, right? They're not even here today. Fine. I have money, too. 20? 50? 100? - I want a condo too sometime. - A penthouse? Isn't this a bit much? A small ground offensive. Gabi, dear, what's wrong? Imagine... - Louie is haram. - Nobody's perfect. You don't get it. Rocky said he's haram, condemned, cursed. - Poor Louie! - It was those Arabs. Look! This is a women only pool. I don't mind. I'm tolerant. Not me. - How old is he? - Five, four. No. Boys over 6 aren't allowed in here. He has to leave. What? It's a pool for women. The boy has to go. He's just a child. Germans don't like children. There are rules here. You can't make your own. Accept that! What are you talking about? You're more German than them! Go home. Here's the key. You're a big boy. You can do it. He's just a child. He's a mini-man. Little Peeping Tom. So long! You wanted to stop smoking. - I'm not smoking. - Okay. I'm just rolling. I'm not smoking. Look. - What? - Where did they come from? They're out to get us. Relax. They're just potatoes. You have no idea. We're the potatoes. It's like the Mafia's horse's head. Wasn't it cheaper yesterday? Weekend price maybe? - They hard-assed me at the nail salon. - Kim... So I quit... What? Look, there's no pork on there today. As if I didn't have enough to do already. - Are you from Switzerland too? - Yeah. What are you doing here? I'm... I'm the boss here. - Ah. - How about you? - Refugees from Switzerland. - Refugees? Since the burqa ban we can't even walk down the street. But here... We're free. It's so pleasant here. - Have a nice day. - Sure. Was that Arabic you were speaking with her? They're all from Switzerland. And it's my fault. Why? I voted for the burqa ban. Delicious, huh? Finally, a woman with a good figure. Rare for Germans. And such beautiful white skin. Thank you. Eva, you look like a lobster. You'll get skin cancer. There. And no more sun for you today. - So you're covering me up now? - And leave it on in the water. Oh, my God. What are they doing on our spot? And we have to sit in the blazing sun? Even more of them! - Here. - On the grass? Don't be so fussy. - Bugs everywhere. - Incredible. Take a nap. So much money to sit on the ground?! I'm going swimming. Leave it on! Not allowed, right? No street clothes. It's organic cotton. You can all kiss my ass. - That's a joke, right? - Hygiene. Or it'd be haram. In Arabic... I know what it means. I'm savvy. As long as it's on a menu. And I can choose, right? Udo says subjugation begins when I have no choice. And I'd rather have pork sausage today. We've always had pork here. Who are you to change things? I don't go to a museum and take down paintings. And I don't wear a Hijab if I'm not Muslim. - It's Herm√©s. - It's cultural appr... What? It could offend Muslims' sensibilities. And the Lamb of God? For your sausage? That offends mine. And I still live in this country, too. - With the emphasis on "too". - Or "still". Don't get nasty. Who even knows if you're allowed in here? - A woman is as a woman feels. - Says who? When is a woman a woman? I'll just drop my panties... - No, please. - We don't need that. That's mean. That's so mean. It was you, right? If you pee in bushes, you shit in water, too. Mehmet, come here. He's just a child. At your age, the same thing can happen. - What? - Watch it! - Is it even human poo? - Well, it's big. Why is everyone so upset by a little poo? - Little? - I mean, the water's chlorinated. - Then you get it out. - Me? - You. - It's Steffi's job. Steffi, get down here! - Down! - Now! Louie? Where's Louie? Who was it? You're the lifeguard. You should know. So, enough is enough! I don't care. I'm not doing it. I've had it! Whoever did it can get it out. Am I the toilet lady? I'm the lifeguard. The pool police! You're not kicking me around like a fucking ball. Like a soccer ball. And playing soccer here is prohibited! Prohibited! And so are clogs! And guess who he belongs to. Admit it. It was you. That's racism. - Always accusing the powerless? - The powerless? What is all this pseudo-tolerant bullshit? Maybe he did shit in the pool. So? Muslim kids aren't allowed to shit in the pool? All kids do. Is our shit any different? Why can't we shit in the pool, too? We always have to be better? Paula, you're a racist. In reverse. Me, a racist? Ridiculous! It could have been anyone. Her, her, her. Yeah, no idea. Maybe it was them. Yes... They've been acting so innocent the whole time. It was them. Do you speak French? Yes, of course. My name is Gabriele. - Kamila Chadat. - Delighted. My husband and I visited Nice a lot. Marvellous... - What are you saying? - I'm sorting it out. What do they want? No idea. Where did you buy that bag? The bag? In Milan. - Oh, Milan. - Yes. Whose side are you on? It's fine. We were wondering what that racket was. - Did she call me a whore? - No, she didn't. - She said putain. - No. I told you we're all whores to them. I'm not, you are! - Watch it, you putain! - Eva! You called me a whore!? - She said it again. - No. Whose side are you on? Is there a problem? You whore, you! Watch it! Backstabber! Louie...? Girl, what's wrong? - I quit. - Why? That's a war! You can't just desert us. You're the lifeguard. I'm invisible here. Nobody listens to me. Nobody even sees me. - I see you. - It's your shit. You deal with it. Come back. We need you. We've lost Steffi. So we cannot guarantee your safety. Without a lifeguard we have to close until further notice. Leave the pool now. - Here, put this on. - Are you crazy? I'm not wearing this! - Want to go to the station naked? - Why not? Pussy Riot. - They provoked me. - No, you started. - Look. - Show me. She's about to hit her. - You started it. - No! You're kidding? Old hippy chicks vs. Nafri bitches. One arrest. Just an unruly senior. We're closing the pool for now. The pool is closed. Time to go home. Now! Yes, now! - Lucky we found you so fast. - Hi. Our lifeguard couldn't handle it. They broke her. - What? Who? - The women. - What women? - All of them. Steffi couldn't take it. But you're in your element here. I can see that. I am. I love water. I'm an aquatic person. An aquatic person? I do TRX and pump iron. You? I just lift a book and my biceps grow. Yeah? Can you show me some exercises? I think you have to open, Rocky. Who found you? Hungry? - Thanks. I brought some porridge. - Porridge? A Rocky for Rocky. You really had it. - Where'd you get it? - Oktoberfest. We were dancing on the tables, Rocky and me. - Okay you get five back. - Wow, you're in a good mood today. - You found someone? - Yes. It's a miracle. - A man. - A man? - That's okay with you? - No one else applied. Labor shortage. No female lifeguards. I don't mind. But whether the burkini crowd can... It's you they mind. In you go. Hi, Ms. Kaiser. I... You don't know me. No toilets here for men? Excuse me... Don't you have any men's toilets? No, not one. Just discover the woman in you. All right. STAFF One. The usual price today. - Your bag is whimpering. - That's me. - Open it. - Why? Complain to your combative friend. Everyone knows you have a dog now. Okay, I'll leave him with you. But I'll check on him every hour and if anything happens my Udo will make sure you never get your own apartment. - Good morning. - Morning. Double-crossing bitch! Ladies, a little more to the right...? - She's making stuffed bell peppers. - I love them. There's a man over there! Men are prohibited in here. Oh, you have them. - You okay? - What is a man doing here? Calm down, I'm post-gender. You're the postman? He's the lifeguard. That man is harassing our niece. No, he wasn't harassing me. Sorry. - No, I'm sorry. - I'm gone. I just need my other... - Come on, out! - Now! - Here it is. - Thanks. Come on, right now! Get out. Girl, you should be ashamed of yourself. - Watch out. There she is. - Yes, I see her. Unbelievable. Wait. Wait. Thingamajig- Yes, it's cruel. - I hate it. - So you can speak German. I studied in Zurich, I shop in Paris, and I swim in Germany. But the only thing you register is the veil. What do you actually know about me? That you're a guest here, sweetie. And here, we make the rules. What rules? What the...? Is that a man? You said there weren't any men here! First a dog, now a man. - Incredible! - What a shame! Too bad, it was so nice. One man is spoiling everything! As always! - What's going on? - The new lifeguard. A man?! Are you crazy? And you didn't warn them? Give them their money back. Thanks. I have a burkini on. And now that's not enough! But it's like you're naked, only in black. We're at a pool for women. Just for women. Just for women... And there's a man staring at us. - He's not even looking. - That's just it. What if someone drowns? He's not a real lifeguard. - What now? - My pool, my body. I'm staying. What about you? I'm staying, too. She can't swim. Who'll save her if he's not looking? They've gone totally crazy. Let's go! No diving! Nobody wants lamb anymore. - Right. Pork! As of tomorrow. - It's deliberate. How do you get rid of Muslims at a women's pool? Right, with a man. - Pork! - It's so ugly. Are you doing a striptease for him? Dream on, Gabi. No one looks at you anymore. You're 58. Oh my. So now we're offended. AQUATIC BEINGS IN LITERATURE He doesn't bother you at all? You don't mind him staring at you like that? Well, I'm not the naked one. Because you let others tell you what to wear. Who's telling me? My macho father? My oppressed mother? My religious grandma? Allah? The only person I can think of is you. How'd you like me? What do you think? A one-piece? A bikini? Stark naked? Know what? You're too stupid to realize what you're wearing. How dare you? That's so prejudiced. - I'm not prejudiced. - I decide what hurts me. I'm not hurting you. All my life I've fought for women like you to be allowed to do what they want here. No, not what I want! What you want. I've always done whatever I want. Why do I always have to defend myself? It's enough! You and your 'rules'! They're garbage! Garbage?! Are you insane? You want to trash me? You, of all people! Stupid bitch! So, now... make like a frog. Okay, watch. I'll show you. It's too deep. It's too deep here. What are you reading? "Undine, Melusine, Mermaids". You're into mermaids? I'm interested in aquatic beings in literature. I study German Lit. I'm literary and aquatic, so to speak. Well then... "be water, my friend". Are you all right? You okay? Can you hear me? Thanks. I'll take over. - Sure you're all right? - Yes. - Are you together? - She's my mother. I see. - Thanks. - Great you were there so fast. You'd have let me drown. Gabi, are you still in there? Open up. Still peeved? - Gabi... - Ms. Kaiser? No... You promised me a pool almost to myself. And an easy job. This is a pool for women. I'm not running them off. I'm done. You? You of all people? He's your doing?! What kind of bullshit feminism is that? Stop shouting! I saved our pool. It'd be closed. This was our realm. Yours. Mine. Us women. Now you, Lady Luxury, are playing the feminist card. I work. Part time. You just want to drive out people you don't like. I don't want to drive out anyone. I'm defending our freedom. Yours! Your freedom! Showing your tits is freedom? But let me tell you something. You're scared of being alone but all you do makes it worse. - Like some sausage? - Have any nuts? Nuts? Yes. Nuts. Thanks. Like a beer? Alcohol free? Nope. How about a J√§germeister'? On the rocks'? No. They were first named and described by scientists in 1997. Compass jellyfish can't swim against the current. They drift between Southern California and Baja. Want to have sex? What? Want to have sex? No, thanks. Just asking. You can stop trying so hard. I'm not going back. I don't want to offend anyone. If I begged you? Without you, the pool will stay closed. What'll I do then? Without my pool, I'm homeless. That pool is my family. Why did you stop singing? I couldn't hear the notes anymore. My hearing was, is, good. But then... I started singing out of tune. It went downhill very fast. And then it was over. Sorry. But isn't it nice not having to be #1 all the time? I liked being #1. And that's why we don't want a male lifeguard! We demand the closure of the pool! We don't want a male lifeguard! Who is behind this? Misogynists! End the systematic exclusion of Muslim women! This pool is for women. Only women and all women! That's why we don't accept a male lifeguard! We demand that the pool be closed immediately! We don't want a male lifeguard! - Who is behind this? Misogynists/ - Look, honey. What's going on? Your lifeguard is a man now? You didn't even tell me. How old is he? What's he look like? Mommy, don't go there. And that's why we don't want a male lifeguard! - We want... - What is this bullshit! You want us to close for good because of one man? The pool's not the same. Men are to blame! The pool's not the same. Men are to blame! The pool's not the same. Men are to blame! Oh, come on, girls. What do we do if most of the women don't want a man? We'll have to close. Great, huh? So nice and empty. Your daughter's not coming? No idea. We want a female lifeguard! We want a female lifeguard! We want... Self-determination! That's what women want! Self-determination! Against discrimination! Who makes decisions about the female body? Hey, come here. Sorry I was so nasty to you. And almost let you drown. That's okay. I'm unsinkable. You don't need to look out for me. I'm fine on my own. They're stubborn. Now you can walk again. I'd love to take this off, too. But fine. You're independent, self-reliant, free. Free... You always told me how great it was to be from two different cultures. How awesome. An advantage. But you didn't tell me that one day people would want me to choose sides. That this rift will never close and I'll never fully belong anywhere. You never told me that either. It's all so exhausting. My baby, I know. I know. Female solidarity! Yes! Female solidarity! Female solidarity! What do we want? Female solidarity! Female solidarity... Eva, out! We have to close down. No female lifeguard, no pool. Out! One last lamb sausage? Free of charge. Well, don't mind if I do. Satisfied now? No one left to bother you. Hi there. I thought I was alone. The captain is the last to disembark. Looks good on you. The combination. Your muscles plus the tail. Biceps. Triceps. Deltoid. Latissimus dorsi. Gluteus. I have a soul, too. - And a brain. - I know. Sorry they're closing you down. But I have an idea about a female lifeguard. Me? I'm not a good enough swimmer. Not you. You're no lifeguard. You're the captain. Yeah. Isn't that... - Come on. What do I do? - Take the pole. - This one? - Yes. There. Wait. You have to stick it in here. It's the wrong way around. That has to go over here. And then here. And now take that. Hold it... - Ah, crossed! - Yeah! - What is that? - No. No! Gabi Kuchenreuther. Message after the beep. Marina, call Eva. No. No, don't call her. Marina, play "Freedom" by Eva Kaiser. The third verse. Everyone wants to be free, everybody You, you, you and you, as well as me But it's all in our heads That's reality You're free as a bird if you want to be It's like a dream that's not meant to be This heat! I've had enough. I'm going to pass out. If we can't go to the pool, what are we here for? Not even air conditioning. Like the Middle Ages. Let's go home. You can go. I'm staying. My daughter needs me. She can't live by herself. Not as a widow. I'm not a widow. I'm not a widow. I'm divorced. Happily divorced. I like being on my own. So egoistic. Yes? Are you okay? They can be so awful. I'll teach you how to swim if you still want me to. - Now? - Why not. - In the middle of the night? - You said it. Where is the freedom The freedom that's real? Who really knows freedom? Who has the real deal? Who really knows freedom? Please let me in. Please. I'm so sorry. You're there, aren't you? You're not talking to me anymore? You're all I have, Gabi. Yes, I am scared. Scared of getting old. Scared of being alone. Say something! Maybe I was a little radical, but I don't hate Arabs. Well, not all of them. And look what I'm wearing. Look. Just for you. So you'd have a good laugh. And you know what? This thing is so practical in the heat. It's so airy when you don't wear anything underneath. Please, Gabi. Talk to me, please. Say something, plea... What? No idea. Do you believe in eternal love? Or... I don't know, maybe. Someone's coming. Turn it off. Who is it? I don't know. Oh, dear. It's just me, Gabi. - What are you doing here? - Walking the dog. - And you? - Riding my bike. - Nice that you're here. - Well... As long as I am, that Arab girl didn't say putain. She said potin: racket, noise. Yes, I know. I was wrong. Sometimes I'm a little... Deaf To other people's opinions. I see, yes. You're right. I'm right? Did you just say I'm right? I'm right?! Oh, Evi... I finally convinced you. We're going skinny-dipping. Like the old days on La Gomera. Remember? - We don't have any towels. - Who cares. You were... i was with Lothar. - I was with Jean Pierre. - Right, Jean Pierre. That's... Kamila. Okay, let's go. - Stop it. Don't be like that. - No. Good evening, Kamila. Oh, Gabriele. Good evening. What are they doing here? - How are you? - Fine, thanks. - And what's this? - Is it party time? That's Nils. Sorry, a man. A man? There. - Thanks. - If he's here, I'm gone. - Chill, Paula. - So are we. It's okay. I'll go. Stop! Everbody cut the crap! Everyone! Calm down and stop being so judgmental. And ask yourselves... How does it feel to be you? You? You? And you, too? It feels good to be you, right? You're the only one who's you. So you should be you as much as possible. Because you are your home. Right? Here. Here at this pool. This is my home. Our home. And home... is the best place to be you. Right? REOPENING Why can't I go in? We'll work it out. Just a matter of time. Is it free today? Just today. Have fun. So let's see. If anyone pees in the water, we can see it. And whoever peed gets caught. Because what don't we do in the water? - Pee. - Right. Can you time me? Go. Show off. Good doggy- Hi. VEGETARIAN & VEGAN - Here you go. - Thanks. Out! Everyone out! Who was it? I asked who that was! There's one rule. Don't pee in the water. Admit it, it was you. You peed in the water.
