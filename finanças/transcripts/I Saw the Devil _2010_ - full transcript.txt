I visited the orphanage today. I go every month, remember? The children are so cute. If I have a child, maybe I'll raise her there. Show her flowers and trees. Plus, it's close to Seoul. The tow truck? They said it'll take a while. I love your voice. It feels romantic to hear your voice in the snow. Hold on, hon. Got a flat tire? Yes, I called a tow truck. In this snow, it could take long. Hold on. Let me take a look. I said it's okay, but he's looking at it. Really? Just wait for the tow truck. No, it's not hard to change a flat tire. But why bother when a tow truck's coming? Hold on a sec. Who's on it? Okay, got it. Hello? Ju-yeon? I'd better get going. Lock the doors and just wait for the tow truck. What? Hold on. Love is... Sweet like... A mother's... Tow truck's on its way. Why does he bother? Too many people here today. Sorry to be working on your birthday again. I'll be home soon. Your car's completely sunk. Thank you, but I'll just wait for the tow truck. Thank you. CHILD SAFE VEHICLE Why isn't he leaving? Mister... Mister... Wait... Your skin's so soft, looks like it'll be easy. Please don't kill me. Why not? I'm... Pregnant. Please, let me live. Dong-su! Dong-su! What? Come here, quick! Chief! Why'd you come here? Stay at home. We'll keep you posted. What's going on? What happened to my daughter! Don't look! Nothing's for sure yet. - Detective CHo? - What? What's this? Move it. It looks like a head. Flip it. Forensics! Come here quick! We found the head! Look after Chief JANG! Chief! Sir! Ju-yeon! Stop taking pictures! You call yourselves humans! Block them off! Still, heaven helped us. Or else, we couldn't have found her. How ironic. I was a police detective for over 30 years. And couldn't even protect my own daughter. Stop smoking, sir. I'm sorry. Really. I'm so sorry. To you... And to Ju-yeon... I'm so sorry. Forgive me, Ju-yeon. I wasn't there for you. Always late... And never there for you. But... I promise you this. I'll make him pay for... your pain. Soo-hyun... For how long? Nothing's busy. Do you want 1 or 2 months off? All I need is 2 weeks, sir. Take more days off. No, I'll see you in 2 weeks, sir. That'd be good for us... But are you sure? Then I'll see to it. Hope you get over your loss soon. Take a good rest. How can this happen? Didn't he get engaged just last month? I don't believe this. The capsule embedded with GPS and microphone. Cool, isn't it? Good job. Thanks. Sure. Aren't you going back? Huh? Anything else to tell me? No. Right. As you know, I snuck this out. If something goes wrong, you and I will... Don't worry. Nothing will go wrong. It looks like the police... Think these four are the main suspects. They've been accused on similar cases before. - Hi, Soo-hyun. - Hi. Did you have dinner? I'd better get going. I bought some groceries for dad. I'll be going then. Take care, sir. - You're leaving? - Yeah. Shit. Quiet! Remember this? You really don't know? Fine. - Sir. - What the hell is with him? He's turning himself in? Says he killed the girl found at Bangho Creek 2 months ago. And the missing Shinchon girl case a few years back. Suddenly grew a conscience? The hell? Who did this? You bastards? No, sir. An ambulance came so I ran up to see. And this bastard was practically dying. What the heck happened? Well, he didn't say anything yet. [Skipped item nr. 144] What the hell happened last night? Help... me... Please. Help... me... What's he saying? Some bastard hammered his balls. What? That's insane! Who broke your balls? Who are you? What the hell! Buses stopped running. Where are you headed? Pardon me? Where are you going? To Sung-min Apartments. Sung-min? Well it's kinda on the way. Hop in. I'll give you a ride. It's okay, but thanks. I'll give you a ride. Get in. Really. It's okay. It's just down the road. Hop in. It's fine. You sure it's on your way? Don't worry. Get in. What? Huh? Nothing. Is this a school van? Ah... shit. Where'd I put it? Why? Huh? Why do you look like you stepped on shit? Never seen a thing like this? Who's there? Why do you need this for the insurance money? I have to identify the policy holder. There are too many people with the same name. These are all old pictures. Perhaps this one would do. I'll ask a few more standard questions. Do you have additional contact numbers for him? I don't. But his son does. Sang-won! Sang-won! Where'd he go? I think it was Yang-pyung or Chung-pyung... Can you verify that this man is the man I'm looking for? Is this Mr. JANG Kyung-chul? It's Kyung-chul alright. But... Is this a recent picture? Why does he look so scary? Insurance, my ass. He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He abandoned his parents and his son. Like he'd take out a family insurance? It doesn't make any sense! Don't talk like that! Am I wrong? No use protecting him. - Shut up! You old fool! - You call that a son! Shut up! Don't get me started! How can you say that? If you can't say something nice, don't say anything! Fuck! By the way... Doesn't the family get the money if the policy holder dies? Are you Sang-won? Do you know where your dad lives? Shit! Why? She's a really good singer. - Maybe I can go. - Of course you'll go. Mom's gonna kill me. Go straight home girls. Okay? Yes, ma'am. Please drive them straight home. Of course. - Thank you. - Sure. Shit. - Can I help you? - Is JANG Kyung-chul here? - Why? Is there a problem? - We're the police. Where is he? He's driving kids home. Shit. Call his cell phone, now! Hurry! LEARNING CENTER Shit. Do not cry on me. Do not cry like a baby. Let's see. You have fair skin. It's okay. It'll be over quick. I lost my damn job. Looks like things are fucked up. But. Shit! Who says I can't like you? What's wrong with that? I can like you if I want. Damn bitches in the world against me all the time. I can! Can't I! Shit. It'll be over quick. I'll make it quick for you. JANG Kyung-chul. What? You're alone? Are you a cop? Must be right. The cops found me this quick? You're shitting me. Guess you don't know who you're dealing with. Damn cops. What do ya expect. Anyway... You son of a bitch! Bastard. What the hell? The bastard's a complete psycho! Shit! Oh fuck... Don't know where you're headed, but you can hop in. You don't want a ride? There won't be other cars. Why are you all the way out here alone? You're pretty lucky, Mister. Catching a cab out here. It's on the way for the man in the back. You don't mind, right? Of course not. It must've been hard to get a cab here. Cars hardly ever go by here. I don't come here much. Just for work. You're really lucky, Mister. Did ya hear? Strange things have been happening around here. So there aren't any passengers out at nights. But I have two tonight. Looks like I'm lucky, too. Right, Mister? Way out here in the dark night. Why, Mister? What's so funny? Mister? Yes? You said we're all lucky, right? Yeah, I did. So? The way I see it... I think you're damn unlucky. Crazy bastards. You're young. It'll heal fast. And soccer... Don't play so rough to break your wrist, huh? Who plays soccer with their wrists? Go easy, son. Got it? Get going now. Hey, shithead. I ain't your son! Shit. Watch the way you talk! Take off your glasses! Take 'em off! Shit! Come here you! Come here! Excuse me? Please come and get your prescription. Damn old folks always talking down to people! I'll rip your mouth off! Watch yourself. How old are you? Twenty-two. Nice and young. Got a boyfriend? Excuse me? Bet you have many, huh? Ah... no. I don't. You fuckin' playing with me? A pretty girl like you without a boyfriend? You don't know how to do it? Excuse me? If you don't, you don't. Actually... I was about to have a good time last night. But some bastard came and ruined everything. So... Let's make this easy. You take it off. What? Strip. Try and enjoy it. So, you take it off. Strip before I cut up your face, bitch! Strip now! Bitch! That's it. Take off your bra. Hurry. Please... Good. Take off your skirt. You son of a bitch! Who the fuck are you! Wait! Stay here. He'll need to get treated. Don't act so weak. It's just the beginning. Remember. Your nightmare's only getting worse. Close your eyes, Miss! Look away and plug your ears. Son of a bitch! Damn motherfucker. You wanna die? You wanna fight me, huh? Damn son of a bitch! Motherfucker. Fine! Let's see who becomes shit! You bastard! What happened, Sir? Did you have an accident? His car must've stalled. Damn dogs. Always going wild... At the smell of blood. Yes, sir. Is everything okay? Just worried that's all. The police think I'm chasing after JANG. The cops are after him, too. I was thinking... How about dropping it now. - Sir... - You've done enough. I want you to stop. But, sir... Forget it. Talk to you later. It's me. Se-yeon. - Soo-hyun. - Hi, how are you? Good. How are you? Well, just busy working on something. Really? What kind of work? You know what I do. I'm asking about what we don't know. Dad gave you the police files, right? Soo-hyun? I know how you feel, but I hope you'll stop. It won't bring her back. Whatever you do to punish him, things won't change. Revenge is for movies. That bastard's a psycho. Sorry. I have nothing to say to you. How come? We're practically family. You know how I am these days? I keep looking back thinking I'm being followed. And you have nothing to say? So, please. This is meaningless. Please drop it. Sorry, I'd better go. And this is not meaningless. Soo-hyun! Get me water! Aren't you sick of it? Try it. You can't get sick of it. Once you taste this. You can't eat other meat. Crazy bastard. What did you just say? Why you little! Gone insane after eating human flesh? Wake up! I'm JANG Kyung-chul! Yeah, I must be damn crazy. This meat's so good, I lost my mind. Why do I cry when I get tensed? Crazy bastard. Remember when we first met? Trying to form a militant group to fuck the world! Those were the days. We weren't afraid of anything! Cut the bullshit and give me a smoke. Bet it's a family member of a bitch you killed. If not, what freak would? He's our kind. He's enjoying the excitement of going out on a hunt. Catching and letting go of the prey. He's playing hunter. He's enjoying giving pain. Man... I think you're screwed this time. The bastard must've gone crazy after losing his bitch. Advent of a monster. How interesting. Get some sleep. We got plenty of rooms. You can sleep anywhere. I'll go prep my next meal. Crazy bastards. He's enjoying the excitement of going out on a hunt. Catching and letting go of the prey. He's enjoying giving pain to his prey. He's playing hunter. Your nightmare's only getting worse. Amusing... Now... I used up all the guts? Not here, either? Then... Come on. Didn't you see your sister? If you fight it, it'll be more painful. I'll end it quickly for ya. So why be suspicious of us? We didn't ask for money or the house! Couldn't let us in, huh! I'm sorry. I'm really sorry! Should've apologized a long time ago. Damn bitches. Always acting up when it's too late. Wait. Hands, feet, then head, was it? Close your eyes. Better not to look. Where the hell? How'd you come in without making a sound? I'm... pregnant. I was wondering about you. You don't look like a monster. Sick bastard. Hands, feet, then head. Right? Just like you did. Nothing more, nothing less. You sick psychos! Son of a bitch. Why! Why!? Why... Why... I'm actually relieved. You had me worried sick for you. It's the secret agent KIM Soo-hyun, right? Want me to show you what he's been up to? Make him stop. He can't become a monster to fight the monster. You know that it is wrong. Where is he now? Your wounds are treated. You'll get around okay. You and that bastard were out for two days. What happened? Sir? Hand the bastard over. I'm far from done. What are you going to do? You know... It feels like a huge rock is pressing down on my chest. Big and heavy. I promised Ju-yeon that I'd make him feel the same pain. It's not over. Far from it. Okay, no more questions. By the way, how's the capsule working? Unless he has diarrhea... Don't worry. The bastard's completely out. He'll be out for another day at least. Sir? You know you changed a lot? Hello. Pain killers please. With dexibuprofen. Dexi what, sir? - Just give me the strongest kind. - Sure. Where are you? Guess you aren't around. Are you listening? Of course you are. It's been a blast. Totally unexpected fun. You! Want me to guess who you are? Your bitch was Ju-yeon? From Yeon-hee-dong, right? You hear me? But, you made a mistake. You took me for granted. You'll regret not killing me. I'll get you soon. Hello, there. Wait. I'll show you what real pain is! What are you doing! Hey, you! By the way. Before she died, she said... She was pregnant. Begged for her life. Did you know? Go! Go! Come quick! Or the man left inside is dead! Should keep close range when hunting me. What the hell! JANG Kyung-chul. Where have you gone? Do we have to do all this to save bastards like them? Seeing scums like them makes me sorry to be human. Call me when they wake up. What is it this time! Yeah. What is it? What? Are you sure? Okay. Hey. JANG Kyung-chul is turning himself in. You made a damn mistake fool! Wake up. I have a question. Where might our friend be? You ticked off the wrong guy. He always gets even. Know what that means? Your girl, her family. Then giving himself up to the police. But... Your woman didn't have it all that bad. Unlike me, he likes to give pleasure before pain. He gives pleasure first. Get it? Funny? That's funny? You think it's funny? I'll make you a smiley face for life! I traced JANG's call. I was tapping the cops investigating JANG. JANG just called them. Said he'll turn himself in today. He says he's doing something first. What if he fucks up again? Where's he located? Yeon-hee-dong. Parcel delivery! Parcel? Is this Captain oH? I'm KIM Soo-hyun. What? What the hell have you done? If something happens to him, I'll kill you! Got that you bastard! Send the closest men to the Chief's house now! Turn the car around! Not much resemblance. Ju-yeon must take after her mom. Good thing she doesn't look like you. Why'd you come at me like that! Old bastard! You crazy? Huh? Wait a minute. Where did I put it? What should I do to make that bastard flip. Will this do the trick? Like this? And this! And this! Like this? Fuck. And this! Dad? I'm home. - What's going on? - Stay back. Back away, please! - Stay back. - What happened? You can't come in, sir. Who the hell! What is it? Step aside. You're KIM Soo-hyun? You stupid son of a bitch! You know what you did? How dare you come here. Damn piece of shit. Back off. Let go! Damn son of a bitch. Step aside. Move! Hello? JANG Kyung-chul here. You bastard! Where the hell are you? You didn't hurt Se-yeon did you? You'll find out later. What? Take this. Hello? So? How does it feel? You shouldn't have fucked with me! You piece of shit! Who do you think won? You think you won? Or me! JANG Kyung-chul! Sir! It's JANG! Wait! Not now! Search the car! Get him! Catch him! Get him! Okay, you're right. I made a mistake. I've underestimated you. I'll treat you right from now on. You son of a bitch! What the hell are you doing? Come on. I'm just getting started. Kill me! You son of a bitch! Kill me, now! You son of a bitch! Hurry up and kill me! You bastard! Kill me now! Not yet. It won't be long. If it was that easy, I would've killed you already. I'll kill you at your most painful moment. When you most tremble in pain and fear, I'll kill you then! Because only that will be the real revenge. True revenge. Let me live. Please? Don't kill me. Heard that many times, haven't you? People begging for their lives. You enjoyed that, huh? Don't kill me, please. I'll pay for my sins. So let me go, please. Haven't you done enough? Please, don't kill me. I'm so sorry. I beg you. Are you scared? Say it. You scared? Now do you realize what you've done? Stop fucking around with me! You son of a bitch! Hey. Cut the bullshit. You already lost. You think you got to me? Huh? Fuck you. I don't know what pain is. Fear? Don't know that, too. There's nothing you can get from me. So... You already lost. Got that? I hope... You suffer even after you die. Son of a bitch! You hear me? You shit! It ain't over. I'll live no matter what! You hear me, shithead! I'm not scared! You think you can fuck with me? Dad? Dad? Hey! Don't open the door! Dad? Don't open the door! Sang-won! Don't come in! What the hell is he saying? Don't open! It's stuck. No! Why the fuck are the old folks here! - Kyung-chul! - Mom! - Are you in there? - No, mom! Don't open the door! Shit! Get away! Kyung-chul!
