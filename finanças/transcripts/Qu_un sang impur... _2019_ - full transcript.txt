So what, the bitch? Have you lost your tongue? If my father, Mohand Aouda, God forbid , was there, he would cut your tongue for talking to me like that. Assia ! My niece ! What are you doing with the French? I am not with them. I am a prisoner. It's your lucky day, niece. Tell them they surrender and we won't kill them. My uncle ! They will only surrender if you give your Algerian word. Tell them they are not afraid. They have the word of a true Algerian. You can repeat it to them. Chahida. How are you ?

If you gotta cry weep at the graves of your father and your mother. And Algerians killed by the French. You understood well ? Him, he saved me. It was not the French who killed my parents, they are Arabs. It is true. It is not the French. And they are not Arabs either. In fact, they are dogs. Tell the colonel who you are. Tell him. My brother, what are you doing here? What is it, uncle? Why did you bring the French back here? I didn't bring them back, they knew where to find you. And you let them catch you? You did nothing ? Why ? Why, my niece? Look at you. Look at you ! You are beautiful, but very frail. You couldn't do anything. Come into my arms. Come on, come on. This Frenchman, Breitner, he didn't leave soldiers as reinforcements? Dirty fucking! We questioned the kids. They said there were five of you. Five, dirty bitch!

Come on. Hurry up! Cut off her ears and slaughter her. Release her. Go get their things. Bring the weapon. Look at the Frenchman you helped. He leaves and he leaves you.
