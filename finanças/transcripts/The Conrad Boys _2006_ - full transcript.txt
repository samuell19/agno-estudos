Charlie, come see! - Can't you knock? - Come! Well, I have to finish this. I built a wall for my fort and it is very strong. Crazy, for a wall of cushions. Did I tell you about the Knights of the Round Table? Later. They are safe thanks to the wall. Even the dog-men who live in the dungeons. What are you talking about? Breakfast! Serious. Go away. Benjamin. Epees, nunchucks, ninjas, dungeons, dragons, moats and knights. Let him go. Leave him. I thought you had finished your homework? It's extra. Did you destroy the wall? I told you not to use those cushions. But my forte? Put it back in place. To think that your mother still cooks your lunches. My mother stopped in CM2. And you survived. - Come on tell me. - What? Are you admitted? - What are you talking about? - What a bastard! Are you admitted to Columbia? - I told you! - I don't believe it yet. Let's skip school! I made extra. We do not care. You are admitted. I'm so glad you could come. My neck hurts a lot. A lot of stress. My husband used the paper shredder yesterday, and he fell on his foot. It's awful. 12 kilos. I had never heard him swear so much. Something is wrong? No, it's fine. We spent the whole night in the emergency room. Suzie? How are you? My God! In the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Lord, hear our prayer. Into your hands we place the soul of Suzie Conrad. Cherish her to heaven as we cherished it on earth. Mary, full of grace, the lord is with you. Blessed are you, and blessed be the fruit of your womb. - Have you seen Ben? - I put him to bed. You could have warned me. Sorry. You should rest. Won't you sit down? Give me the plate. No one will blame you if you rest. Let me do. Shit! Put some water. Charlie, stop! It'll be OK. Do not leave. ONE YEAR LATER Your mom and I loved coming here. We came every day, to sit down, talk, laugh and make plans. You wanted to do "Law". And she met your father. He didn't even come to the funeral. Does that surprise you? Comment from Ben? He's fine. He has some problems at school. The teacher says he's withdrawn. He may need a change of scenery. Ben could live with me. Thanks, we'll manage. And college? I pushed back. - And the money? - I work at the restaurant. Plus the money mom left us. I know you want to take care of it, but you are so young. Things will change. Let me take Ben for a few months. No thanks... While you decide what you want to do. - I know what I want. - You're only 19. I know what I want. I try to help. So stop trying to take it from me. I'm sorry, Louise. I appreciate your interest, but I talked about it with Ben. I will take care of him. Go away Wake up. Everything's good, it's just a dream. Take a deep breath. GOOD. Everything's good. Do you want to tell me? I was in a castle. Everyone was there, even you. It was very dark. Everyone was turning into a vampire, like Dracula. And I looked at you and you also turned into a vampire. It's just a nightmare. It can't happen. I was so scared. These are stories. Dracula and vampires do not exist. How do you know? I read it in my books. Dracula was just a mean old king, called Vlad, who liked skewered rats. Do not move. Close your eyes and hold out your hand. Vampires hate garlic. APARTMENT A LOUER. You came at the right time. This apartment is renting very quickly. People love trees. It's a bit of a tree house. - Is it a quiet place? - Yes very. Alright. And, if you're wondering, these pretty brown furniture are included. I begged the owner to get rid of it, but it's the type to drive until the wheels fall off. - You remind me of someone. - Ah good? Were you at Bat Yam Temple on Sunday? I was there. I was saying to myself. The first time, right? The first time in a long time. You go back home? Somehow. I'm interested. Awesome. I give you a form. Here's my card. My personal number is on the back. THANKS. Shall we finish the visit? Another box for Ben. His room looks like a homeless shelter. Are you ready for tonight? Party? Party... - You promised. - There's Ben. You told me that Louise was keeping it. I don't want to party. You come and that's it. I never have fun with it. Of course, with this attitude. You can't spend your weekends reading old stuff, it's not good for your health. I do not know anyone. You know me, me. I pick you up at 8 o'clock? That idiot Miss Kessle put me in the corner. Cool, ton dragon! I can draw? Want one? - Why are we here? - To have fun. What do you want? We have beer and... beer. - I do not want anything. - You'll be unnerved. It's OK. Drink. You conduirai. Is it for you or for me? It's not for me. You never know. Look people. You are here. I didn't choose. - It's for you. - You think? You go-y. You're sure? - My teeth? - Perfect. Is it the line for the toilets? Do you have it for a long time? Move on! Whore! There are people who want to pee! It's dead today. Are you doing well? For what? You were tense last night. How are you. If you want to talk... How are you. Sit where you want. I will be back. What's good? What did you take? Turkey club on wholemeal bread. It looks good. I made my choice. Want company? You're sure? My name is Jordan. Charlie. What are you reading? "The Stories" of Herodotus. Ancient Greece? Exact. I tried, but I didn't like it. For what? It's too dry. I prefer literature. For what? It's humid. I'm kidding. Do you prefer novels? I am a writer. What are you writing? It depends on my desire. Poetry, short stories. Sometimes I work on my novel. A novel? It's based on my travels. The places visited, the people met. It's very "Jack Kerouac". You want to drink something? A root beer. You travel a lot? You could say that. Let me summarize. You went to visit Mexico, and you ended up staying a year? - Why are you gone? - My car was stolen. Did you file a complaint? It's no use there. Besides, the time had come. I took a bus ticket, and here I am. Why here? I have an old friend. Some recommendations? What do you mean? Where are we having fun? I dunno. You live here? I do not go out much. Tell me charlie why this interest in ancient Greece? No one had ever asked me. There is always a first time. Because of everything they've done. The Greeks anticipated thinking in many areas; democracy, philosophy, theater and even literature. You are interesting. You will be one of the characters in my book. Good luck. Hello, this is PJ. Leave a message. I was hoping to bump into you. I know it's been a long time. I wanted you to know that I'm back. Maybe we could meet again? I don't really have a place to go right now. I'm sorry for the last time. I know that... it ended badly. Finally... Call me, same number. My friend does not pick up, I wanted to surprise him. Where are you going? Looking for my brother. Can I come with you until he calls back? Vas-y Ben, monte. I'm sick in the back. It takes a minute. Come on. Ben, voice Jordan. Jordan, Ben. Hi, how are you? Well, say hello. Good morning. Come, I want to show you the dungeon. Hold on, let me talk to my friend. T'as promis! In a minute. Don't slam the door. Sorry, he is not used to seeing people. I'll see if it's okay. He is fine? I don't know. Funny kid. It's your mother? She is pretty. THANKS. Where is she? And vacancies. Where is your father? He left. THANKS. To write a character based on you, I'm going to need more info. Like what? First of all, what are you? What do you mean? Your mother looks Asian. She is Chinese. But, you're not completely Chinese. My father is Jewish. Are you half Chinese and half Jewish? Doesn't your mother have to be Jewish for you to be Jewish? I've heard that before. My mother is Catholic. - Sounds complex. - It is. No wonder it didn't work. Cinnamon flavored rice cakes? Gluten-free wheat cookies. Wasabi flavored dried peas? And past Doritos? Where were you? You didn't want to talk to me anymore. I want more. I brought you something. Come with me. So! This is my garage... with a blanket. Smart ass. Sat. What are we doing? I thought we needed a little recreation. Want to smoke some weed? Can not. For what? Because Ben is here. He dines. What if he comes here? Relax. I have never done that. Serious? You are such a nice boy. Put it in your mouth. When I turn it on, take a deep breath and keep the smoke as much as you can. Come on, suck, suck... How are you? It's horrible. Look at. You see? Try again. Once again. Perfect. Wouldn't it be great if it was a magic carpet. Completely. Do you have a mom? Is she nice? She is okay. My mother was nice. Do you remember when we were talking? Enough to? About my mom's vacation. She's not on vacation. Where is she? She is dead. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want you to know. Have pity on me. Let's play a game. It's called "5 in 10 seconds". It's harder than it looks. The rules? First, I give you a category. Let's say... Superheroes. You have to find 5 of them, in 10 seconds. Understood? Ready? Batman! My god, this is difficult. All X-Men! It does not count. - I don't know. - Finished. I won. My turn. Your category, It's the bands of the 80s. Guns 'N Roses? Guns 'N Roses? It counts? Blondie, Creedance Clearwater Revival! It's finish! It's very difficult. There was a nail. I do not feel good. And damn it! I must have passed out and he left. He left a note? What a mystery... Hello Charlie. Can we talk? - What happened to your hand? - Nothing. I hit myself. A doctor saw her? It does not hurt. I learned for your mother. It's been over a year. I know, I'm sorry. Sorry for not coming to the funeral. I did not know. Comment from Ben? He's fine. He had to grow up. I miss you. Awesome. I'll be right back, Charlie. I will stay. To help you with Ben. We don't need your help. Please. I am your father. - There are people... - Listen! You are upset and you have the right to be. But I came back. I can't be well without knowing if you're happy. I have to go. He says he wants to help with Ben. In just one time? Did he look good? I believe. He looked calmer. What are you going to do? I dunno. I don't want Ben to see it. It's her father, Charlie. I do not care. As a father, he has custody of Ben. Legally, he can take Ben whenever he wants. He left for 6 years. That's why he won't. He knows that we would sue him. How's your hand? It hurts a little. You fainted. I know. I wanted to put you in pajamas, but I didn't want you to find me too direct. Your friend called? He must be on a business trip. I took a room in a motel. It's good. I want you to come with me. Sorry. SO? - Where you go? - I go out. I can come? - Why not? - Because. Sometimes adults have to go out with other adults. Alone! Who is coming? Tori comes. I hate her! - Do not say that. - She stink. It's wrong. She burps all the time. I will tell him not to. My sweet home. Sit down. I dont drink. What? I dont drink. You're right. No need for that. Call room service? I hadn't eaten it since I was a kid. You're still a kid. Ben loves it. He loves sugar. Can I ask you something? Of course. What would you do... if you didn't have to take care of your brother? - I dunno. - Of course yes. Come on. I would go to college. Or? New York. J'adore New York. You and is there? I lived with an artist in the "Village". He called his large paintings "Horizontal Dreams". I will write a chapter on him. I lived there for about a year. You lived everywhere for about a year. Are you trying to figure me out? You are shaking. I know. I can't help it. Relax. Everything's good. Sorry. It's new for me. It's OK. I won't do anything you don't want to do. Shit! Where you go? You said 10 o'clock. Sorry. I had to see the guy from the party again. I fell asleep. Are you kidding me. Where were you? Go back to bed. - Where were you? - Do not scream. I don't shout! I am an adult. You don't have to know what I'm doing. I'm pose ca. I had another nightmare. Put it down! The vampires were closing in! There are so many, we can't hide. It's mythology, it's not real! It's real! You freak me out with your vampires! You are always afraid! What did I say? Excuse me. Are you doing well? Go to bed. Here we are. The crime scene. Attends. Let me take the tour. Here is the living room. As you can see, it is spacious. Note the high ceiling and moldings. And of course, the sublime brown sofa. Don't forget the trees. People love trees. It's like living in a tree house. I'm going to make coffee. You smell so good. Let's visit the room. Attends. I really want to be with you. But I can not. Sorry, it is difficult to explain. Try. Evelyn, I messed up so many things in my life. Sorry, it must seem... It's OK. I appreciate you a lot. More... There is no "but... I can't be with you before you think I deserve you. We will take the time you need. We should have taken a taxi. Everything is my fault. Hello PJ. I was hoping to bump into you. I know it's been a long time. I wanted you to know that I'm back. Maybe we could meet again? I don't really have a place to go right now. I'm sorry for the last time. Hi it's me. PJ! It's been a long time. Is this a reproach? - How are you? - GOOD. I hear you're looking for Jordan. Exact. That bastard called me. He's in town. What are you doing? A Pont Levis. It looks good. I brought you something. Cool! You like? - And guard! - Attention, mon grand. I go! Hello, Ben. Ben go to your room. NOW! I was passing, I saw your car. I believed Ben at school. It's a "school at home" day. It still exists? I took you to the sea on a day like this. You picked up something purple and tangy and you started crying. I do not remember. I hope I can take Ben there. It's not a good idea. We may need some help discussing this. Let's get together. Alright. I want Louise there. My client just wants to see Ben every week. Doug left for 6 years. All of a sudden he wants to play sugar daddy? I remind you that Doug is Ben's father, and has parental rights over Ben. I remember you that your client does not have the best parental background. Doug works for a construction company. And can contribute to Ben's well-being. He was an alcoholic. He's been sober for two years. His friends and colleagues can attest to that. He abandoned his family. He preferred to leave. He didn't want to harm his family because of alcohol. He had a problem. He overcame it. A judge won't think that. A judge will think your client is only 19 and earns his living as a waiter. Charlie saves money for Ben's education, each month. Because of the circumstances, the law is very clear concerning the precedence of the rights of the father. You wouldn't want to go to the judge. Its a threat? I don't want it to happen like this. All I ask is to see Ben every week. It's the manager! I can help you? - It does not work. - What? You heard, it doesn't work. What bad luck! I lost my card. Someone must have used it because the account is dry. It sucks. And I can't use it anymore until it's fixed. Can i stay here? I dunno. Why not? It's complicated right now. For example? My father came back. He lives here? So it doesn't matter. Come on. I don't want to beg. I don't want to beg. But, you sleep on the couch. I don't want to upset Ben. - Awarded. - And more grass. I'll put my things in your room. I'm joking. Isn't that high enough? Almost. Do you have an old rag? For what? A small accident. Cool, the castle. It's a strong. Alright. And that? The drawbridge. Cool. And in there? This is the dungeon where the dog-men live. The dog-men... It's very cool. And that? These are the moats. They go around. Cool. Stop saying "cool". He is sleeping? He doesn't love me. He likes you. He hates me. - But no. - But if. He's just possessive. Well, he hates me. Charlie? You want some? Let's play knights. It's silly. No, it's funny. You can be Lancelot and I will be King Arthur. Alright, let's go play. "Eggs Etcetera", hello. Charlie, this is for you. Le Proviseur de Ben. At first they fought with imaginary swords. Then Ben started hitting Andy for real. Andy is okay? He has a broken nose. My God! Ben n'a jamais fait ce genre de choses. He went through a lot of hardships. When a child loses a parent, he often reacts violently. Did he consult afterwards? She said he was doing fine. Nevertheless. Does Ben behave differently at home? He's a bit moody. His teacher says he is worried. I know you are doing your best. Watch for things that could cause her stress or any lack of stability. What shirt do you want to wear tomorrow? Je m'en chip. I hate this jersey. You adored him. Now I hate him. Why do I have to go there? Because your daddy wants to see you. For what? He misses you. Why don't you go? I am older. This is not the same. What if I have a nightmare? I almost forgot. You will be safe. Hello, come in. I really like trees. Ben's room is over there. Go and see her. I really appreciate it, Charlie. He must be in bed before 10 p.m. Its very important. No sugar after 8 p.m. And he has cavities. He has to brush his teeth after dinner. You brushed your teeth all the time. After every meal, as one should. The dentist said he never saw a mouth as clean in a 10-year-old child. You were so proud because you had to choose an award. I watched you as you detailed each toy to choose the best. Should you take the car or the parachute? - Or that sticky thing... - Stop it! - What? - Stop these stories. For what? You try to make everything right. Your stories don't match my memories. Charlie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything I've done wrong in the past. For every time I hurt you. I wish I could start over and improve everything. But you can't. See you tomorrow. Do you like smoked beef? I dunno. It's the best beef sandwich you'll find. It's a specialty of the Conrads. Look at this. Bon, hey? Where is yours? I can't eat until tomorrow night. For what? Because it's Yom Kippur. Is it Jewish? It's a special day. You tell God that you are sorry for your wrongdoings. - Aren't you hungry? - I'm starving. Why don't you eat? That's how God knows I'm sorry. Charlie told me you liked loud ones. Could we make something together? What? What would you like? A shield. A shield, okay. Next time we'll make a shield. There's a room for Ben. So what? So this is Ben's room! He constantly talks about the past, but only memories sanitized at the beach. He's not gonna talk about the bad times. The three years before he left, I never saw him sober. I promised myself never to be like him. You said he was different. What if he's pretending? Once, when I was 10. It was summer and I was running around the house shirtless. He came home early from work. Must be the day he was fired. He was completely drunk and continued to drink. As I ran, I knocked over his drink. He was smoking a cigarette. He caught me he took his cigarette and burned my chest. Good God. Do you have a scar? I can see? Let me see. I wrote something for you. "Ocean waves, "a drop came to me "whispering I love you. "I've traveled a lot just to see you, "to touch you. "Because I can't die without seeing you. "Because I'm afraid of losing you". It's "Because I would have been afraid of losing you". C'est de Walt Whitman. Residence Conrad. Charlie is there? Tori just picked it up. C'est Ben? What is it man? Your chariot is there, Master Benjamin. - I can help you? - Is Charlie here? Well is there? You must be Doug. Your cherche Ben. He's there. Thank God. He is fine? I can? - He doesn't want to see you. - Who are you? I'm Jordan, I live here. I'm sorry, I had gone to the temple. I thought he would still be sleeping when I got back. Charlie told me about you. Children don't like to wake up and be alone. - That's why... - It upsets the children. I just want... - Calm down. - Go away! I do not want to fight... You should have seen it. He no longer knew where he was. Did you hit him? - For what? - He forced entry. How did he react? He left. - You should be happy. - For what? He's an asshole. - Good god, Jordan. - What? He's going to use that against me. And? I must be a good tutor for Ben, provide him with a safe environment. Didn't you say you lived here? - Good God! - What? You are really stupid. Do not insult me. Stop being stupid. What's your problem? It's you who do what you want, according to your desires, without worrying about the consequences, as long as you have fun! And you, you want to control everything otherwise you freak out! Some have responsibilities. Some are too afraid to be themselves. You're so afraid of becoming your father that you don't live! Out! Out! Did you clean it? He didn't miss you. And you didn't reply? Are we going to the park? Not now. Why not? - I'm tired. - For what? - I did not sleep. - For what? No reason, leave me alone. Where is Jordan? He's not there. I heard you arguing. Why this? - I don't want to talk about it. - For what? - I do not want. - For what? Because. Why did you hit Eddie? I hate him. It's your friend. - I hate Eddie. - Stop saying that. - I hate Andy. - Stopped! I hate Eddie, I hate Jordan and I hate you! I hate you! Ben called me. I know. I authorized it. Did you tell him he could come and sleep? He keeps talking about a shield. We're going to make one. Ben told me you were teaching him to be Jewish. I told him about Yom Kippur. Which one is it? The Day of Atonement. There are all these books in which God writes the names of all. On Yom Kippur, these judgments recorded in the books are sealed. It's like history. You should come to the temple one of these days. - I'm ready. - And your bag? He smells bad. I want to speak with Charlie. Can I wait in the car? It is open. I wanted to apologize for what happened yesterday. It wasn't you who hit me. Nevertheless. This guy, he said he lived here. It is a friend. Do you know him well? It's not a good idea for him to live here, especially for Ben. You don't have to tell me how to take care of Ben. You can't criticize after what you've done! I am your father! When you feel like it. Why did you come back? How did you get back? It was open. I can have water? Where were you? Are you interested? You're right, I don't care. - You fired me. - You were a real jerk. You also. T'as bu? - Great. - What? Nothing, everything is fine. Go, little ones. Do what you want. - Where you go? - Let go of me. Leave me! - I'm sorry. - Do not touch me. I am... Sorry. Let go of me! So sorry. How are you, bump? What do you think? Not bad. When do we paint it? We will do it. I saw this at the store, you should love. Don't worry if it's too much, you'll finish it later. Want some? No, it's fine. Is it still Yom Kippur? You don't like that? Yes, I like that. You deserve it more than me. You deserve it. Vince. It's been a long time. Where were you? Here and there. That's to say? I was in Culiacan. Without dec. I was in Culiacan, two months ago. And or? Wood. What a coincidence, I went to Madera too. Let me guess... Next was Tijuana. I am right? I have to go check my car... We frequent the same places, it was inevitable that we would meet again. What happened to you? Who did this to you? - It's an ugly thing. - What? I'm too dumb. - You are shaking. - I'm too dumb! Calm down. Tell me what is happening. I stole a car. A Mexico. You told me your car was stolen. I stole the car. That was four months ago and everything was fine. And I saw this guy Vince again. He cheated me and I lost all my money. I was enraged. I took his car and left. - Where is the car? - I sold it. I needed money! So this guy Vince did this to you? He has a gun. - I call the police! - You can not. I'll have to explain the car theft. It won't end! Where is he now? Did you bring him here? He wouldn't let me go, he wants his money! Where is he? Spent. Why did you bring it back? I thought... You have money aside I can borrow some from you something to calm him down. You want some money? You're saving up for Ben. You too cash on delivery. You want me to give you Ben's money. You take me for an idiot. You engineered it all. You have nowhere to go, your car has been stolen. It's not that! It's what? He is going to kill me. There's 5,000 in Ben's account. - It's not enough. - It is all I have! - Give the phone. - For what? Give the phone! Doug, it's me Charlie. And there is a passage for each of the rooms in the fort. It's very elaborate. I have to go out for a while. Evelyn will take care of you. I come back soon. Why are we here? For the distributor. - A distributor? - It's 5 p.m. The banks are closed. It's a beginning. Give me that fucking card. It better work. You are arrested for withdrawing stolen money! - It's not my card. - Tell that to the judge. Go outside. Go over there. You also. Sat! You also! Is your name Jordan? You have a hell of a reputation. Your buddy is wanted in two states for identity theft. He has been monitored by my department for a month. And now we have it. How old are you, Jordan? 22 years old. You think you have all the time ahead of you. You think you can still do this for a few more years. Lying, stealing... And then I'll stop. 20 years will have passed, so quickly. 20 will have passed before you know it. You will have screwed up your life. I'm tired of seeing people like you waste their lives. What's your name? Vincent. You're not from here, huh? Upright. What is...? You're lucky. We're not after you. I don't want to see you here again. Get out of here! - What about my gun? - Go away! Not bad. Not bad. Are you going to take them away from me? A WEEK LATER What are you doing? I'm hungry. I want to go to daddy! Alright. You go-y. Number 14 is calling for water. Shit. I'm sorry. What is wrong? It has been a week. He disappeared. He will come back. Non. He's like that. Nice to show you. Sorry, I shouldn't have left. Why are you gone? Because... I was ashamed. I thought you left. I was. I had to come back. For what? Tell you I'm sorry. I didn't try to trick you. I want you to know. I never wanted to put you in danger. - You can't live here anymore. - I know. - What if Ben had been there? - I know. It was worse than stupid. Comment from Ben? He's fine. He hates me, but that's all. - He doesn't hate you. - He hates me. He's at Doug's. He still wants to go to Doug's. And now? Are you going to look for an apartment? A work? I can't stay here. Why not? Vince knows I'm here. He will come back. Where are you going? I'm going back east. You came back to tell me you were leaving. I want you to come with me. What? I want you to come with me. - You're crazy. - Think. We will cross the country. Just the two of us. We will stay in small motels, we will eat sweets. We'll see everything you need to see. Le Grand Canyon, Walden Pond. We can go to New York. I will show you around. I'll show you everything how to take the metro, how to cheat for shows. I'll take you to the Metropolitan. You can explain the paintings to me. You can go to school. You can do whatever you want. Attends. I wrote something for you. For real this time. "From behind your book, "you caught my eye "with your hurt and discreet air. "And like a book, "you captured me, "chuchotant de mysteriouse. "And although I ask for the imaginary, "You served me the truth, "revealing myself to myself. "Now I understand "and our story continues. "My eyes are rested, "my heart is revived, "You are the book that I can no longer close." Ready? Let's go. Enumère 5 types of bagels. Your Jewish side comes out. La ferme! Les bagels. Go! With eggs. At the water. Sesame seeds. Jalapeño cheese. Black cumin. Poppy. I got you. I prefer to play when you're high. I need to pee. I will be back. I can't leave. This is where history fails. How so? She does not provide the words for this kind of situation. And Literature? "What's that feeling when you walk away from people "and fade until their silhouette disappears. "It's a universe that goes beyond us "and that's goodbye." - I'm sorry. - Dont be. It was fun. Behave well. What are you doing? There's more room here. I can help you? Which one is it? UCLA. Why your mother's maiden name? Connections with the Mafia. I always knew it would happen. You're going to go to school and forget about me. I am not yet admitted and I will continue to live here. Will you make the trip? Do you eat fries? What is the problem? I didn't know you liked that. You didn't tell me if you were coming to the party? You too force pass. I don't want tonight. But soon, I promise you. I didn't tell you what happened at the supermarket. I was in line and the bag guy, very cute, looked at me. That's great, let's go see him after lunch.
