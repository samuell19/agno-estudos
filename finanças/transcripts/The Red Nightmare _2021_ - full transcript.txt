[Johnny] You're not a burden to me. Stop staying that. I know, but you have so much on your plate with your mom's funeral. [Johnny] Yeah, but if you weren't here with me to go through this process, I don't. I don't know how I'd be able to survive it. (ominous music) (knocking) - Chrissy? - Yes. Wow, you look even better in person. Thank you. Are you Marcus? Yeah, come on in. Let's get started. So, I admire your work. Is that the camera you always use? Yup. Wow, you are so. So beautiful.

Momentum or gravity can applied as well as torque to any of its infinite axis. Distinguished and unidentified by a particular characteristic, it remains difficult or impossible to understand or explain. (ominous music) Would you look at that? It's nice, huh? Who would have thought about stuff like that? Stuff like what? You know. [Nadia] It's just there. It's normal. Right, it's so perfectly round. And it's beautiful. Uh, okay. Could you at least try to entertain me? No. Not really. It's a strange thing to think about. If it's so strange then what do you wanna talk about, your dead dog Timmy? (dramatic music) Wait, why did you say that? You think its strange to talk about so why don't we talk about your dead dog Timmy. How could you say that? What? How could you say that? I mean if you wanna get nasty then I'm going to get nasty. Why would he say that? Fuck him! I should be with Roger. He has more money and better hygiene. (knocking) What! [Larry] Nadia. What? [Larry] I'm sorry, okay. Well, why did you have to say that? I know, I shouldn't have said that. No, why the f... Why did you say that? [Larry] I don't know. You know me sometimes. Why? Why would you say such a thing? It's just how I get sometimes. I'm sorry. I'm not, I'm not the devil. Why are you looking at me like that? You're awful. You are awful like the devil. Why would you say that to me, I'm not. Yes you are. I loved Timmy. And I loved Timmy too, but he didn't love you. That's why you were saying all these mean things. Do you wanna go eat ice? [Nadia] Did you say ice? Mm-hm. (ominous music) Did you say ice? Yes. I love ice. I wanna chew it until my teeth bleed. Mm. (munching) Oh, that's nice. Mm, yeah. It's so cold. Mm. I'm sorry, okay. I'm sorry. I just, sometimes I don't know. I don't know, it's just. It seems so. But isn't it. [Demonic Voice] Mesmerizing? [Larry] Yeah. [Nadia] Now I get what you were trying to explain me. To compare me. The beauty of the sphere. It's smooth. It's like the universe. Yeah. Oh my god, we need spoons! (ominous music) There are none. They're in the drawer. No, there aren't. Well you, just look around. I already did. There are no spoons. Well, maybe you need to look better. (dramatic music) Why are you being so rude to me again? I'm not trying to be rude. I mean, I'm not trying to be rude. Well, you are. Can you just find a spoon for me? Are you serious? Are you serious? You were, you just apologized to me and now you're just being rude. Wait no, you don't get to storm off. I get to storm off! You don't get to storm off! I storm off! Things have been odd. Every since you came around she hasn't been in her right mind. I mean, I guess I did mention about her dead dog. Which is also my dog, too. But that doesn't give her a reason to try to emotionally break me. I guess she was kind of logically thinking and having some reason when I did say that. But do you know why things have been weird? Are you talking to yourself? Or to the ball? I don't know which one is worse. I actually wasn't talking at all. Do you know how I know that you were talking? Sure. It told me. You're being a psycho today. Am I being a psycho? No, you're right, I'm being a psycho. But you like that. You're right, I do. It's her fault, your honor! She came in here with a bad attitude. And she didn't wanna play with me. Shut up! You're just a damn fool with no direction. [Larry] Why would you say that to me? [Nadia] Because it's true. You have no direction and you're a damn fool. (water running) This doesn't make any sense. It's just a ball. Why is he talking to that stupid ball like it's his god? What the fuck? It's his god. Oh. (ominous music) What are you doing? Nothing. Do you study it? That's exactly what I'm doing. Or do you worship it? Why would you assume the worst? You know it's wrong to put someone else's before your lord, Larry? This morning I was acting a little strange and I guess, mean. But now, you're the one who's getting progressively mean. I, I'm just calling it like I see it. Well, Nadia. What? I'm glad that your dog Timmy died. (dramatic music) He was just a stupid old mutt. Really? [Larry] Yup. And if he was a female, I would call him a little bitch. Did you do it? Hm? Do what? You know what. I don't. Did you do it? Did you kill Timmy? Of course not. Hey, where are you going? Whoa, whoa, nelly. Hold your horses. [Nadia] Did you do it? Did you kill Timmy? [Larry] Of course I didn't kill him. I loved Timmy. [Nadia] You said you would be happy if he would be dead. [Larry] No, no, I didn't say that. [Nadia] Yes you did. [Larry] No, I didn't. [Nadia] Yes you did! [Larry] No, I didn't. [Nadia] Yes, you did! Quit it! (screaming) (eerie music) (knocking) (sighing) (ringing) [Host] Hello? Yeah, hey it's Jake I'm here for the Airbnb.

I was just under the impression that I was gonna be here alone. [Host] Oh, I'm sorry about the confusion but it did say on the listing that it was a shared living space.

When you were growing up, did you ever play hide and seek? Of course. I used to play a lot with my friends when I was a kid. But I would raise the stakes and make it more fun. Like with knives. My friends don't play with me anymore though. They've all gone away. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Shit. Seven. Eight. Nine. 10! 11, 12. 13, 14. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20! Ready or not, here I come.
