Sujin is here. Eonni. Eonni! Have you been doing well? When I arrived?! Just now. Are you done today? Eonni... You've gotten prettier?! Right... I bought you a present. How long I'll be staying?! Can't stay here for long. When Dad's ceremony is done, I'll stay a few days and go back. Summer classes are starting right away. Tie up your hair with this. Let me do it. Done. Let me see. Wow... It's so pretty! Eonni... Is it fun? Her name is Anastasia, Imperial Russia's last ruler. She never revealed the name of her lover to the rebel forces until the last moment, so they burned her at the stake, after cutting off her tongue with nippers. Wait! Hi. What are you shooting with that camera of yours, wandering all day? Yes... Flowers. I wander the mountains, shooting wildflowers. Aigoo... Flowers?! They're all over the place here. Why would you need to shoot flowers? If you really must, shoot me. So all those photos must be flowers. Yes. Have a nice day, then. You, too. Your sister has the day off tomorrow, so help her out with the honey. Tomorrow? I was going to meet someone tomorrow... You can finish early and then leave. It's too hard for her to do it all by herself, so help her out. Mom, instead... If we sell all the honey, you'll buy me a beeper. Aigoo... Your sister has never asked me to buy her anything, and you... Back in fifth grade... Again with that! If you say that another time, it must be a hundred by now. I'll do it. Happy now? Nah, Eonni. It's Mom that's making me miserable. I'll wash my hands. He asked me where he could find a place with blooming dandelions, but I told him I don't know. "Dandelions?" That guy with the motorbike. Eonni. You know, the guy who rides the motorbike? He's the tea field owner's grandson. He's majoring in photography at a college in Seoul, and seems he's doing an exhibition with what he's shooting here. No, I saw him downtown when I was out with a friend. He was shooting photos even though it's raining?! Also, tomorrow... He said he'll take me on a ride with his motorbike. Remember when we were little, and we picked flowers at this mudang's place. When she came out and we ran away scared. I told him about that place, and since he was interested, we're going there tomorrow. Why is it so cold in here? I need to go?! Go where? If he sees I'm not coming, I guess he'll just go. I said it's all right! I'm so sorry. I was sick so I couldn't even hang out with you. I'll be back when summer classes are over. I'll stay longer, then. Right... Eonni. Is there anything you want me to bring you? When I come back, I'll buy it. Still... We're leaving. Eonni, looks like I need to go. Can you get up? Let's bring you to the hospital. I'll help you up. Looks like you hurt yourself really bad. What do we do? So you can't... Can you read my lips? If I speak like this? I didn't know that. Are you really all right? Everything okay? I thought you'd just step aside... Wait here just a moment. We've met quite a few times, haven't we? I was on my way to Seoul. So that's why I was waving, to say goodbye. I just thought you hadn't seen me. So I wanted to come closer and meet, and have a word with you, that's why. I was surprised as well, but are you really okay? That's a relief. I was really shaken up. Anyway, I apologize. I should have been more careful. Should I give you a ride home? I wanted to at least leave you a little present. Can't give you this... Ahh... This could be all right. It may be small, but the sound is not too bad. I wanted to leave you something, so please accept it. I'll come back to shoot photos in the winter, if you're looking for me. I guess we'll have to wait until then to meet again. I think I should at least give you a ride home... All right, then. I'll get going. What is wrong with you? Did anything happen? Aigoo... Hey... Speak to me. What on earth happened to you? Did anyone harm you? Or did you just... Aigoo... Why did you faint out there, all of a sudden? Shouldn't you at least tell me? What made you faint? Can you read my lips? Right... Then, will you explain what happened? Aigoo... This is killing me. You silly. What happened to you? The doctor needs to know that, if you want to be cured. Aigoo... People passing by found her lying unconscious on the side of the road. Seems like it happened while she was coming home... But I wonder what really went on. I can't take this anymore. Goddess of Mercy. Come! Come here! What? What is it? Did she regain consciousness? What's wrong with you? Call 911. Her medicines. Wake up. Hurry up. Give me her medicines. Wake up! Hey! I beg you, wake up! The medicines! Quick! Put this in a glass of water. Have you called them?
