WOMAN: Dear Ann, I walked in on my 17-year-old daughter with her boyfriend. She says they were using protection, but I don't think that makes sex right at their age. What can I do to make them stop? Signed, Helpless in Harrisburg. (TURNING ON RECORDER) EPPIE: Dear Helpless, though I agree they started too young, experience has taught me that once the horses are out of the barn, it's hard to corral them back in. Congratulate your daughter on being smart enough to insist that her horse wears a saddle. But you have the right to insist the next time they feel the urge to ride, they hoof it elsewhere, not home on the range. Signed, Ann Landers. MAN: Dear Abby, a pushy new manager has taken over my office. She has all kinds of liberated ideas like hiring foreign types, even homosexuals. How can I improve the quality of the personnel in my department? Signed, Besieged in Boston. Dear Besieged, quit. Signed, Abigail Van Buren. DRIVER 1: You know, I've driven a lot of busy people, Miss Van Buren, but you beat them all. Don't you ever stop working? POPO: People never stop writing. DRIVER 2: Here we are at Central High, ma'am. Better put your work away. You must get bunches of those letters, Miss Landers. EPPIE: Thousands every week. They all get answered, though. DRIVER 2: Everybody's got problems. That's true. Stop here. It's early. I, I just want to see if she's coming. DRIVER 2: Who, Miss Landers? EPPIE: (CHUCKLES) Oh, my sister, Popo. DRIVER 2: Looks like a full house. Don't wanna be first? I tried that once. (SIGHING) (PIANO PLAYS INTRODUCTION) * Daisy * Maisy BOTH: * Give us your answer true * We're half crazy * All for the love of you... (WHISPERING) Eppie was first by 17 minutes... Esther Pauline. Then came Popo, Pauline Esther. REBECCA: They've been singing together since they were five years old. * We can't afford a carriage... REBECCA: You know, they were born on the 4th of July no less. (CHUCKLES) For years, they thought the fireworks were all for them. * A bicycle built for two They probably still do. * There ain't gonna be a marriage... Twins are each half an egg. That's why they'll always love each other best of anyone in the world. * ...a carriage * And we'll be damned * If we'll be crammed * On a bicycle built for two REBECCA: Wonderful. (ALL APPLAUDING) ERNEST: Bravo! HERMAN: Bravo! Very nice! So wonderful! Now, look at this. The column from their college newspaper. ERNEST: "The Campus Rat." They have such a way with words. Mother! REBECCA: Well, it's true. They're good at telling people where to get off. EPPIE: Oh, thanks a lot, Papa. Enough! Uh, who wants dessert? Oh! Come on, Ep. REBECCA: They made the desserts themselves. (BOTH GIGGLING) So, Herman, what do you think? He's okay. Everyone says he's got money. You like Herman so much, Popo, you be his date. (SCOFFS) Oh, and you take Ernest? Mr. Excitement? He is so "earnest." (CHUCKLES) (WHISPERING) The scarf! They were about, let's see, probably two and a half at this point... (WHISPERING) Girls! BOTH: Guess who? ABE: Not again. POPO: So, did Herman ask you out again? EPPIE: Oh, I told him to call me Tuesday. I'm just gonna wait for Gary Cooper. (DOG BARKING) POPO: (LAUGHS) You could be waiting a long time. Poor boys. Poor boys? Eppie, what about poor us? Some day our princes will come. And if they don't, we don't get a life. We've got a few years yet. I'm telling you... A little here, a little there. We could have noses just like Lana Turner. Yeah, when we get our noses done, you can get Lana Turner, and I'll get Betty Grable. But that would be different! Popo, we get our princes, things are gonna have to be different. No, they don't. (SIGHS) Well, for one thing, we'll have different last names. But not if we marry brothers. We could have a double wedding. And then what? What happens later, huh? The wedding night. Think about it. Oh! You know, some things we just can't do together. (LAUGHING) (BOTH LAUGHING) (BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING) (FEET TAPPING) EPPIE: What I think... WOMAN: Yes? Don't play games. Be confident! Easy for you to say, Eppie. You're always ready to take on the world. Yeah. Well, why not? Look, you should just tell him straight, "Either build a nest "or don't touch the feathers." (LAUGHING) Well, this girl's got to powder her nose before she's ready to take on the world. I'll wait here, Popo. Smile, girls. What? Here comes Mort Phillips. He's worth a mint. Which one is he? Over there. He's kind of cute. That's what I think. I'll be right back. You be nice to him. Uh, pardon me, miss... Eppie. And I'd love to dance. After you. Hi, Eppie. Hi, Popo. EPPIE: Popo... (SIGHS) Have you met Mort? Mort, this is my sister. I would have never guessed. No one can tell us apart. MAN: Whoo! You wanna try? I'll try. May I? Mind? Mind? Why should I mind? (SLOW MUSIC PLAYING) (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Hey, Eppie? Mmm. You wanna dance? No, in a second. Something's happening out there. (BIRDS CHIRPING) POPO: Do you like this one? ABE: Very nice. Isn't that sweet? I like that. There's a lot I like here. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Isn't that nice? That is a beautiful invitation. Yeah. I'm glad you like it. (ALL AGREEING) I think so. Papa, are you sure it's not too expensive? Only the best for one of my girls. Popo, it's gonna be a beautiful wedding. Eppie, come. Take a look. ABE: We need your opinion. Which of these ballrooms should I book for your sister's reception? The bigger one. (CHUCKLING) ABE: You didn't even look! Oh, baby! No! ABE: Mama, this is wonderful! REBECCA: I'm so pleased. ABE: Wonderful! REBECCA: Congratulations! Popo, did you know about this? (LAUGHING) Congratulations! POPO: What is going on? Congratulations. MORT: Congratulations, Herman. Oh, we are so pleased! Oh! (WHISPERING) So Herman? Mr. Okay? Are you sure he's the one? Herman's good. He's decent. Besides, you would die if you had to walk down the aisle without me. So, Herman, when's the lucky day? BOTH: It's a double wedding. This soft bit... Mmm-hmm. (EPPIE AND POPO LAUGHING) EPPIE: You're so bad! (BOTH WHISPERING) (BOTH GASPING) POPO: Oh, that one. EPPIE: That you can't rent. EPPIE: So, when he took you home, did you shake his hand? POPO: I can't believe you! (BOTH GIGGLING) Oh, Popo, come here. What? EPPIE: Look at this one. (BOTH GASPING) This is a dream. It is. EPPIE: Look at this. POPO: Oh, my goodness. Eppie, is this too tight in the... How do you like this one, Popo? Knockout! Well, what do you like about it? Well, um, it's, uh... Elegant, yet intelligent. Interesting, joyous. Utterly unique, like you. Did I say all the right things? Yes, and particularly "unique." I like the unique. But, Eppie... What's the point of having a double wedding if we don't make the most of it? You're right. Double or nothing. Eppie, what about this one? JULES: Oh, I think these are you. EPPIE: Oh, the shoes are stunning. This is exactly what I had in mind. Ep? JULES: So you like them? EPPIE: I, I don't know. I better check with my sister. Oh, I think she'll agree. You know, I figured you could show your togetherness with the dresses, and your individuality with the shoes. (EPPIE CHUCKLES) Good idea? Thanks. I feel like Cinderella. Well, with feet this pretty, you should have a glass slipper. Oh, that's very sweet of you, but this isn't a fairy tale. With someone like you, it really should be. You're holding my foot. I am. (CLEARS THROAT) Um... Mmm... EPPIE: I'll be out in a minute, Popo. (CAR HORN HONKING) I, I was... Say it already. (SIGHING) I can't, Miss Friedman. Okay. I guess we're done here. It's your sister, Eppie! She is so, uh... So... Engaged? Well, that's the problem. Look, Prince Charming, if you want my advice, a "no" is better than always wondering what might have been. Right. (SCREEN OPENING) Eppie, um... Why don't you just finish up here, and I'll be outside? Is there anything else, Mr. Lederer? You're not gonna believe this. That salesman, Jules... Jules? Stop it! Popo, he just asked me out on a date! And? And, and... What, and? I'm engaged! I mean, sure he's charming... Oh, charming? You stop! I didn't say yes. And you didn't say no. Look into your heart, Eppie. If you're gonna marry, marry for love. You know, it's supposed to last forever. That's my advice. RABBI: ...usual not in that we are present at the marriage of two wonderful people, but rather unusual in that today we celebrate a double blessing, double joy. For we are all here to witness the marriage of the twin daughters of Abraham and Rebecca Friedman, Pauline Esther and Esther Pauline, to two wonderful men, Mort Phillips and Jules Lederer. Jules, will you place the ring on Esther's finger? Repeat after me. (SPEAKING HEBREW) ALL: Mazel tov! (APPLAUDING) MORT: What's wrong, Popo? POPO: Every time I write Eppie a letter, I can't help thinking about it. MORT: Thinking about what, honey? POPO: We're so blessed, and they're so struggling. Poor Jules out there on the road selling pots and pans. I feel guilty. Popo, when your father fled Russia, he sold sewing machines to earn a living. Look how things turned out for him. Things will get better for Eppie and Jules. You'll see. He's a hard worker. You know, Mort, I was thinking we should talk to the architect about maybe building a nursery. Sounds like a plan. Well, you know, it's something to think about. Okay. (BABY MARGO CRYING) EPPIE: Hang on a minute, sweetie. It's almost ready. I know, I know. Yeah, here we go. (BABY MARGO CONTINUES CRYING) It's okay, Margo. I've got your bottle. And I made it nice and warm for you. Yes, I did. How are you doing, my beautiful? All right, come here. (TELEPHONE RINGING) I know. I know you're hungry. Oh, it's okay. (TELEPHONE CONTINUES RINGING) Hello? JULES: Sweetheart. (WHISPERING) Did Manny call? EPPIE: No. Why? He was supposed to be here 40 minutes ago! How am I gonna make the sale without Manny? He's the cook! Listen, when he calls, tell him to get right over here. Okay, I will. Good luck. JULES: And now, as Wizard Chef promises... (WOMEN GASPING) ...perfection every time. WOMAN 1: My compliments to the cook. WOMAN 2: Oh! Well, it's not the cook. It's the cookware. It sure smells delicious! That's because the flavors are all locked in. That's the Wizard Chef guarantee. But more important, ladies, the patented vitasave design ensures that the nutrients your family needs to stay healthy stay in the food. Why, just look at the muscles vitasave has put on Mr. Lederer. (ALL CHUCKLING) I want a set of those pots. I do, too. Well, terrific. Why don't we step right up and taste time! I can't wait to taste it. (WOMAN GIGGLING) JULES: Bye-bye. EPPIE: Bye-bye. WOMAN: Bye. Oh, I feel so alive! Six whole orders! We make a great team, you and I. Much better than two guys. What are you talking about? We're already a team, you and I. Well, at home, sure. You don't want me at home? In the bedroom with the lights out. On. Okay. Hey, Jules? Yeah? Being a housewife is wonderful, but it's only half a life. You know, I feel like the other half of me is being wasted. I can be a wife to you and a mother to Margo, and still do a lot more than just stay home all day. What are you, superwoman? No, just capable. Yeah. Well, listen... You better lay off stroking my muscles in public. (CHUCKLES) It's driving those housewives crazy. Come on, Jules. I'm serious. I'm serious, too. Manny is the guy... Oh, Manny! Those women were paying attention to me. Did you notice? Yes, I noticed. Yeah. And who sold six orders in one day? JULES: You are relentless! All right. What do you say, Jules? It's a deal? We're partners? (SIGHING) Partners. Thank you. Love you! I'll check on Margo. Okay. Hurry back. (WHISPERING) She's sleeping. Jules, what's the matter? I just got a new job. And they don't take partners. JULES: I'm drafted. Yeah. (DOOR OPENING) Eppie, got to go. Mort's home. Give Jules our love. Hi, sweetheart. Eppie again. She's certainly gonna miss Jules. (SIGHING) We have been so lucky. MORT: Looks like I'm gonna be there with him. EPPIE: Popo, I can't believe we're doing this. You're a terrible influence on me. POPO: Hey, it's like Mama always said, "When you're down in the dumps, buy a new hat." (EPPIE LAUGHING) Oh, Popo, it's so good to have you in Chicago. Although I feel a little guilty about not volunteering at the hospital today. It's like we're playing hooky. Oh... Hey... What's the matter? I am scared to death, Eppie. What if they get sent overseas? Cheer up, sissy, they're gonna be fine. Don't borrow trouble. How can you be so calm? I'm not. I miss Jules terribly. Oh, we would have been so great working together. Oh, you can't tell me you actually enjoyed selling pots and pans. I like working. Oh! No, not our style. Yeah? Not yours, maybe. Ooh, are you going to get it? I love it. Oh, but not that much. But it looked fabulous! No, I'll just keep looking. Let me buy it for you. No, Popo, that's not how it goes. Oh, come on. It makes me happy to see you happy. POPO: Now, aren't you glad we got these hats, Eppie? Oh, it looks great on you. I didn't even know we could wear that color. You know what? We should do something really unforgettable for the boys. A surprise that'll last forever. The Lana Turner special. (LAUGHING) Well, I was thinking more Betty Grable. Mmm, as long as it matches. Would it be so bad if mine was a little different? Eppie, being the same is what makes us unique. Whenever I wanna see how special I am, I just look at you. But, Popo, I'm not you. But you look like me, think like me, act like me, do things exactly the same way I would. We've been given a gift. Treasure it. I, I just don't think of it that way. But you feel it. To our new noses. I'll be back in Chicago in two weeks. We'll do it then. WOMAN ON PA: Dr. Kirchey to room 203. Dr. Kirchey to room 203, please. Mrs. Lederer, a telegram just came for you. Yeah. A telegram? Mmm. Thank you. "Dear Eppie, I hate to let you down, "but Mort nixed our surprise. "He likes me the way that I am. "Hope the doctor won't be mad at us for calling it off." Mrs. Lederer, we can't wait any longer. I can do your sister next week. My sister canceled. You're canceling now? No. No, I'm going through with it. It's time to break the mold. RABBI: The mystery of life and death is beyond human understanding. We are perplexed and overwhelmed when pain and suffering befall those whom we love. We are gathered here to pay our last respects to Rebecca Friedman, devoted wife to Abe, loving mother to her twin daughters. (SPEAKING HEBREW) (SOBBING) (SNIFFLES) (CHUCKLES) Look at that. Mmm-hmm. Is that sweet? I thought they were so cute, the two of them. Hey. Oh, Eppie, I can't believe Mama's gone. Yeah. At least she wasn't in pain. She was always the strong one. Do you think Papa's all right? (ALL CHUCKLING) I love that. Oh, girls! Come sit with me. Come. Thanks. So, are you okay, Papa? Mama wouldn't want us moping. Mmm-mmm. That's right. Popo... What would she want us to remember? Good times. You know what's in this book? A family growing up together. And we're gonna keep this family together, aren't we, Jules? We have some great news for everyone. Jules is gonna join me in Eau Claire at the company as soon as we get out of the army. This war will be ending soon and the country's gonna need to rebuild. And I'm gonna need a great VP of sales. Oh, that's terrific. ABE: That's wonderful news, boys! MORT: We've been serving in the same outfit. We love each other like brothers. He said we'd love Wisconsin. Wisconsin. Imagine, the twin act back on the bill again. WOMAN: Hey, Francine! Ronnie, I want you to take these fliers and cover downtown. EPPIE: I've already done the south side. All right, tomorrow we're gonna put out our statement to the papers. I figure if we make enough noise up here, they'll hear us down in Madison. RONNIE: All right. Are you ready? Oh, hi, honey. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Is it time already? Yeah. We've got to get to Popo's, pick up Margo, get back to the house, get ready for the dance. Okay. I'll be back first thing in the morning. Okay, bye-bye. Have a nice night. JULES: Eppie, come on. Let's get going. We're gonna be late. You know, there are much more important things than a country club dance. Besides, I don't have a thing to wear. I've heard that before. You know, that company from Chicago called again. They keep upping the offer. And? Well, at least it's nice to be wanted. EPPIE: What do you suppose they do in all those rooms? JULES: Come on, Eppie, be nice. EPPIE: Yeah. I'll be good. Is that another new car? (EPPIE CHUCKLES) JULES: Funny. How come I always think of Versailles, and Marie Antoinette when I come here? (SHOUTING) Uncle Jules! JULES: There you are. Get up here, Edward! EPPIE: Oh, Margo. How are you doing? Fine, Mommy. Hi, Daddy. Hey, sweetheart. Uncle Mort said to say he's on the back porch. Okay. All right, here we go. All right. Here we go. Here we go. Come on. Come on. Those kids are terrors. I know, but they adore you. (CHUCKLES) I'm trying to teach them songs you and Aunt Popo used to do. Mmm-hmm. Jeanne's got the words down, but Eddie thinks they're gross. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Hey, why don't we have one of our special days this weekend? Maybe Saturday we'll go into town and have lunch, huh? And you didn't even have to check your calendar? Oh! Very funny, smarty. Come on, you. Hello! Help! Give me that gun! Give me the gun! Edward and Jeanne Phillips, outside now! And tell Margo we're leaving in 10 minutes. Oh, take this. Hmm. You'd think the riding lessons, swimming lessons, tennis lessons would tire them out. Here, got to wear this one. Oh. Oh, this will be a big hit down at democratic headquarters. Which reminds me... I need you to sign this. Do you think those petitions do any good? Yes! Oh, I'll sign it later. Hey. How's this for an evening of political rabble-rousing? Look, Popo, thank you, but you know I can buy my own dresses. Jules makes a perfectly good living. I don't need your hand-me-downs. I just want you to have what I have. But what I have is what I chose. Eppie... Wait! I've got a genius idea! (SIGHING) How would you like to wear this? Popo, I told you... Ooh! (TELEPHONE RINGING) JULES: Hello? Oh, hi! I swear, if I hear one more word about their tennis and riding and swimming... JULES: No, we were just getting ready to go out. It's okay. I swear I'm just gonna scream. JULES: No, we... Yeah, no, no. I've been... I've been thinking about it a lot. Yes. No, very seriously. Yes, sir. Yes, yes, thank you. Chicago again? Jules, take it! I know, I know. It's just, you know, Mort's been so good to me. I know Mort's been great, but it's been years, and you've earned everything, right? I think you're a little prejudiced. (SIGHING) Maybe it's time to make your own mark. Help me. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYS) Look at her. MORT: Would you relax and enjoy yourself? Hi, Ethel. DON: Hi. Don. How are you? I wish Eppie wouldn't do that. This isn't a political convention. I think you're overreacting. Well, I just don't think it's right for her to use the club as a soapbox. Nobody minds except you. You know what? Mmm? I'm going to get a drink. You look stunning tonight. If you don't mind, I'm going to circulate this petition before they start serving dinner. Eppie... I hate what McCarthy's doing as much as you, but... But what? We have to live here, you know. Mort has to work here. Some of these people they get nervous if you refer to Washington as a revolutionary. Yeah. Well, some of these people are a little too comfortable in their perfect lives. Eppie, I love what you're wearing. Is that Dior? It suits her, doesn't it? You know, it's always been one of my favorites. Sissy, let's get some air. Excuse us, Phyllis. (MUSIC STOPS) Please don't give me a dress, then rip it off me in public. I didn't! You know, I should've known better. It's my fault. There is always a price. Eppie, it's not like that. Oh, it's not? Look, if you don't like the way I act, then don't invite me to your country club. I'm just being me. Yeah. Well, I'm just being me. What are you two up to out here, huh? Nothing. We were just getting some air. Mmm-hmm. I was just, uh... I was just trying to break the news. What news? About Chicago, the job in Chicago. Jules has been offered a great opportunity. You're moving to Chicago? They've asked him to run this really big company, lots of responsibility. I haven't actually committed. I've been very happy here, Mort. Don't let our friendship stand in the way. If this is the right thing, grab it. Sure, I mean, you know, if, if that's what you really want. Chicago's always been a special place for me and Jules. You remember? We were young. We were poor. (CHUCKLES) We were in love. Oh, it was grand. (DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) Oh, hey. Mmm-hmm. All right. Come on. (LAUGHING) Come on, Jules! It doesn't look good for the president of the company to be late. Oh, now, what good is it being president if you can't set your own hours? (LAUGHING) Come on, don't mess up my hair. I just fixed it. I have my interview at democratic headquarters today. Oh, yeah, right. They're gonna love you. (SIGHING) Mmm. You know, the place is looking fantastic. Really. You must be finished unpacking. Not quite. Oh, good morning, Margo. "Seven rules for good posture"? Please. Nobody reads Ann Landers anymore. She's so L-seven. L-seven? Yeah. Um... "L," seven, square. Ah! Whoa! Whoa! JULES: No, wait. Is that all you're gonna eat? I'm fine, Dad. Oh, I forgot. Um... Aunt Popo called last night. Now you tell me! What's the big deal? You two are always talking. Of course we are. She's my twin. I don't know how you can stand being a twin. It's like you're only half of something. I like being a whole person. You know, the first rule of good posture... Don't stick your foot in your mouth. Let Daddy walk you to the bus stop. Bye, hon. See you. MARGO: Bye. JULES: Good luck! (DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING) (TELEPHONE RINGING) (ELEVATOR DINGS) Hi. (SIGHING) EVANS: Almost, almost. GALLAGHER: Okay. All right. Who's dealing? EVANS: I am. Are you in? Mr. Gallagher? I have an appointment with a Mr. Gallagher. What can I do you for? I'm Eppie Lederer from Wisconsin. Oh, yeah, Eppie. Heard good things about your work. This is Bob Salinsky, second district. Hello. Al Logenick, his associate. Hi. And this character is Dean Evans, edits the Sun-Times. EPPIE: How are you? Are you new to Chicago? What paper you read, us or the Trib? Us, of course. You've got a good paper there, except for that Ann Landers. She's a real L-seven. You know, a square. (MEN LAUGHING) What? I said something funny? You just told Ann Landers his column stinks. Ann Landers is a man? Last time I looked. GALLAGHER: The gal who wrote Ann Landers died. Evans has been fillin' in till he turns up a new broad to write it. Now, Mrs. Lederer... Uh, Eppie. Here. Okay, Eppie. I see that you were local party chairman. You got good references. Been working against Joe McCarthy. You know, this is all great but I don't have anything suitable for a gal of your experience. No, I, I'm willing to work my way up. This is Chicago, toots. I got 1,000 foot soldiers ahead of you who've been walking the district for 20 years. GALLAGHER: There's got to be something more suitable for a little lady of your many talents. I'll take two. EVANS: "The Campus Rats"? You wrote a column for a college newspaper? Two dozen lady reporters with real newspaper experience have put in for this job. You're not even qualified to enter the contest. Well, I couldn't do any worse than the current Ann Landers. What does a guy have to do to get rid of a gal like you, Mrs. Lederer? Give me a chance? EVANS: All right. Bring in some samples. "Dear Ann Landers, "I've got two daughters who are smart and know how to fight back. "I know the modern child-rearing method "is to let the child develop as an individual, "to be given freedom. "But what about discipline? Signed, Frannie." (DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING) Hello, operator. Can I have the number, please, for a Dr. Benjamin Spock? That's right. Yes, I know the head of the Mayo Clinic is a very busy person. Tell him Landers of the Sun-Times. Yeah, I'll hold. Hey, hon. (WHISPERING) Hi! How was your day? Shh! Yeah, Doctor. How are you doing? It's Ann Landers here from the Chicago Sun-Times. Uh, I have a question for you. JULES: Frugal. Prudent. How about Scottish car rental with a little tartan-plaid logo? No go? Jules, keep it simple. You know, it's for people who are on a budget. Budget Car Rental. I like that. Mrs. Lederer, you're amazing! Beauty and brains! Oh, why, thank you, Mr. Lederer. Mmm. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hmm? Hello. Uh, one moment. He says he apologizes for calling so late. Who? His Excellency, the Archbishop. I'm impressed. I wonder what would have happened if I called the Pope. Hello, Your Excellency. How are you? (BUSY SIGNAL) Now, I want you to taka all of these out. What does she do, leave it off the hook? Just a sec. Wrap this up very securely and take those two out now. I have been trying to reach her for an hour. Don't make so much of it. We're going to be 1,500 miles apart. You two are never that far apart. Besides, the last time I checked, they had phones in California, too. Oh, you don't know. You have no idea what it's like to be a... Twin. I know, I know. You know what I mean. When she moves away, we move further away. And a year goes by, then another. We just keep getting farther and farther apart. I know. I love you. Oh, shh. Ouch. (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) (TELEPHONE RINGING) Eppie, goodbye. Goodbye? Farewell! And hello, Ann Landers. You don't recognize your name? You got the job, toots. EVANS: Bright, insightful, informed. Think of each word as 10 bucks out of your paycheck. Then that puts me in the minus column. You're a quick study, Annie. Uh, it's Eppie. Here, you're Ann Landers. Here's about 600 letters. Pull 60, answer 20, and we'll work three of those into shape. Oh, yeah, and each signed letter gets an answer. When I was doing the column, I sort of fell behind. Hope you're a fast reader. (SIGHING) (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) Good night, Fred. See you tomorrow. Dear Ann Landers, it's midnight and my missus is missing. What do you advise for getting her hands off the keys and onto me? Patience and a cold shower. JULES: Thanks a lot. Oh, darling, I am so sorry. I... Oh, what can I say? You married a nut! Oh, Jules, for the first time in my life, I feel like I've really found my calling. Feels good, huh? Unbelievable. Well, don't work too hard. My advice? Get someone to help you with this backlog. After that, smooth sailing. Okay. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hello. Sissy, hi! How are you? Mmm, still unpacking. Oh, I know we've both been busy with moving, but I really miss our gabfests. EPPIE: Are you all settled in the new house? Mmm, almost. Decorator's still working on it. What's up with you? Well, I'm sitting here staring at a mountain of mail. (CHUCKLES) It's not the holidays yet. No, not cards, letters. Hundreds of them. And they all need an answer, Popo. I got a job! My sis, a working girl again? Oh! Poor baby, she's had to take a job. Sounds like some sort of sales letter. Uh. So, what are you selling? Something glamorous, I hope. No, I'm writing a column. A what? I have a new identity, even a new name... Ann Landers. The newspaper lady? Well, you'll always be Eppie to me. She's writing the Ann Landers newspaper column. Mmm-hmm. It's sort of like having a tiger by the tail, a bit scary. Oh, when have you been scared of anything? Well, I'm going cross-eyed reading all these letters. I think she needs me. Uh, maybe you need glasses? No. Maybe I need help. Oh, she needs me! MORT: Good. Just for a few days, huh? If you can manage it. Oh, sure. The kids will be fine with the housekeeper and Mort. I can manage it. Maybe, uh, I could leave tonight. No, no, tomorrow will be fine. But what about... Oh, Mort? Oh, you'll be okay, right? Oh, he'll be fine. All right, don't worry. I'm on my way. Don't panic, the cavalry is coming! Bye! So, did you just move in? (SWING MUSIC PLAYING) Just. Just married. Oh! Me too. Oh. (GIGGLING) Hey, what are you readin' today? Oh. You read the news? Nah, all the "Russians are coming" stuff... It's so depressing. I read advice. Advice? Mmm-hmm. "I'm 34 and I've fallen for the delivery boy. "He's a lot younger, but so cute. "Trouble is, I don't think I'm the only R & R stop on his route." (GIGGLING) So, what's the reply? "What this kid is delivering to your home "sounds like baloney. Signed, Ann Landers." (GASPS) (ALL GIGGLING) Let me see that. EPPIE: ...a second. All right. Listen to this. "Dear Ann Landers, "our neighbor's dog barks all night long. "What can we do?" I'm gonna answer this one later. Okay, what about this? "Dear Ann Landers, "I've been a waitress for seven years and I am bored with my job." Oh, let's answer that later, too. Okay. Wait a minute. Hold the phone. "Dear Ann Landers, "my son was married seven months ago, "but he and his wife just had a 10-pound baby boy." Let me guess. They told grandma that the big baby was early, but she has her doubts. Right! What would Mama say? The stork was on schedule. It was... The preacher who was late. You know, we're great at this. You know, and people are listening to us. You know, Popo, you have been such a wonderful help. I mean, I was buried before, and now it'll be smooth sailing thanks to you. Why does that sound like a pink slip? No, it was a thank you. I mean, I could never have gotten through this backlog without your help. Yeah, well, you can say that again. Our column is a knockout. Our column? No... (SIGHING) Popo, they hired me. (TYPING) Oh, so, what you're saying is, "thanks for the grunt work, Popo, "but don't forget your hat." Oh, come on, be logical. This can't go on forever. I mean, we both have our own lives. You've got Mort and the kids and, and a house in a different state. Oh, I'll pack. Honey, don't do this. What? What? Do what? Make such a drama out of this. Well, you're right. It's no big deal. Hey, sissy, it was great fun while the party lasted, huh? So you understand? Well, sure I understand. Hey, you don't need my advice. MORT: So, how was your flight, honey? Honey? It's good to have you back. Your old foursome's been asking after you. (SIGHING) I, I don't mean to be mean, but if I have to spend one more afternoon on the golf course, I'm liable to wrap my putter around someone's neck. You're good at tennis. So you could always take up tennis. No, it's the country club. It's all of that. When I was working with Eppie, I felt so alive. It's like I was born to do that column. Don't get me wrong, Eppie's smart as a tack, but the zingers were mine. Hmm. You know, I think maybe I'll just, uh, check around the papers. Oh, isn't that moving in on Eppie's turf a little bit? What turf? She's in Chicago, 1,500 miles away. I'm no threat. Threat wasn't my word. Put it in another way. If you already had a career, any career, and if Eppie decided to take up that exact same career, you wouldn't mind? No, I'd be flattered. And she will, too. She'll be thrilled. You know. I'm just, uh, following in her footsteps. Hmm. (CABLE CARS PASSING) Excuse me, sir. Yeah? You have someone to see you in your office. Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on a minute. Listen, Pepe... Popo. We have an advice columnist. Uh, she's mediocre. And Ann Landers is trouncing her. How did you know that? Go bother the fashion editor, huh? Good advice is always in fashion, Mr. Royce. Oh, that's cute. No, that's wit. Give me a stack of letters. If you don't like what you read, you'll have to live without me. (TELEPHONE RINGING) (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) (ROYCE LAUGHING) This is great stuff. (LAUGHING) I love it. But who's Abigail Van Buren? Abigail from the Bible, she gave advice. And Van Buren? Eighth president, elegant. That still doesn't tell us who Abby is. Me. I'll think about it. (TELEPHONE RINGING) (SIGHING) Oh! "Marriage is a promise before God "that two people will love one another "until death separates them. "You can't be a coward and run for the exit at the first sign of trouble." (TELEPHONE RINGING) Ann Landers. (SIGHING) Sissy, why, why would I mind? Abigail Van Buren? It, it's not like I'll be competing with you. I mean, well, Ann Landers is syndicated all over the place. And my Dear Abby column is just in one tiny, little paper way out here in California. I think it's wonderful that you and I have ended up doing the same thing, don't you? I love Ann Landers telling this lady who doesn't want to iron her husband's underwear, "you're lucky if that's the only wrinkle in your marriage." "Iron your troubles away before your man finds someone else to steam his shorts." She doesn't say whether to use starch. Holy moley, listen to this. "I've been dating a man who hints of marriage, "but he seems more interested in the money I earn as a brassiere model." What? That's not in Ann Landers. It's in Dear Abby. Who? How could there be another column worth reading? Give me that. "What do you think he really sees in me?" Well, what does this Abby say? "Gold in them thar hills." (ALL LAUGHTER) Have you read the Trib today? Three weeks and she's in Philly, Tallahassee, and, can you believe it? New York. How's that for sisterly love? (CLATTERING) (YAWNING) ROYCE: We never expected Dear Abby to take off like this. 40% growth over the last six months. I mean, 20 years I've been syndicating, I've never seen growth like this. I'm so happy people like me so much. And I can do better. I know I can. What are Ann Landers' numbers? You can't compare yourself to Ann Landers. I mean, that column's been around a long time. Then you get out there and sell, sell, sell, because I'm gonna be around a long time, too. It's like I said, Mr. Evans, she's gaining outlets. This is not a competition. Besides, our papers are bigger. EVANS: That's right, Ann. You own more eyeballs, and that's the name of the game. It's not a competition. But still, we should put my face out there. You know, match a face with the name, for the eyeballs. Television! Put me on TV. Let them see who they're writing to. That way, there would be more outlets and more readers. Glad it's not a competition. Birth control? Ann, we can't print this. And I can't ignore what my readers wanna discuss. Dean, times are changing. But think of the controversy. Exactly! Wait a minute! Who's in charge here? The readers. But if I don't lead, who do you think they're going to follow? (SCRAPING) Mrs. Jules Lederer, a very striking signature... (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) ...and no doubt an excellent clue for our panel to use as they try to discover your secret occupation. Tonight on Person to Person Dear Abby, or Mrs. Morton Phillips, as she prefers to be called, has graciously invited us into her home. Have you met today's deadline, Mrs. Philips, or are we interrupting another long day at the office? Heavens, no, Ed. 8:00 to 3:00 and not a minute more is all the time I allow for my "hobby." You see, being a wife and mother is my true career. WOMAN: Is your job in any way provocative? I hope so. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Not in the way that Miss Kilgallen has in mind. That's five down and five to go. I imagine your new celebrity has had quite an impact on your home life. Oh, Ed, I'm no celebrity. No. My loving family is my blessing, and that's enough for me. Yes, well, the question that's on everyone's mind, what's Dear Abby's formula for good living? To experience life in all its goodness, one must open oneself up to the needs of others. For if you aren't giving, Ed, then you aren't living. MAN: Mrs. Lederer, do you often write about l'amour? And how. Would you by any chance be a lovelorn columnist? (AUDIENCE GASPING) Yes. WOMAN: Of course, it's her, Dear Abby! Mrs. Lederer writes an advice column for the Chicago Sun-Times. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Ann Landers. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (HORN HONKING) (TIRES SQUEALING) REPORTER 1: Abby, welcome to Chicago. Well, thank you. It's great to be here. Abby, there are a lot of people in there dying to meet you. POPO: Hey, if it's for the column, let me at 'em. REPORTER 2: How long are you planning to be here, Abby? POPO: Oh, only a few days. I've got a lot of mail to answer. (REPORTER 2 LAUGHING) REPORTER 1: I'll bet you do. Ann, we got to get in there. Every sales manager that matters is gonna come by our booth. Mmm. Hers, too. That's the whole point. You want ours to be empty? Come on. Ann, please, this isn't gonna look good. You think nobody's gonna notice that you're not getting out to say hello? (EPPIE SIGHING) All right! Can you take that? (CAMERA CLICKING) EVANS: Now, Ann... Don't worry. I can handle it. All right. Okay. Hello. Hi, sis. Oh, I caught you on TV. Likewise. It was just so wonderful. And it's been such a long time since anyone confused us. Brought back a flood of memories. REPORTER: Smile, girls. (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING) WOMAN 1: Dear Abby, my husband always sleeps stark naked, gets up, goes into the kitchen, and makes breakfast still totally nude. I worry that there's something wrong with his behavior. What do you think? Newlywed. POPO: Dear Newly, you've got a man who cooks? Quit complaining and ask him to put on an apron when he's frying your bacon and eggs. WOMAN 2: Dear Ann Landers, I'm 66 and my boyfriend is 68. Who should be the first one to offer a kiss? Have the rules changed? Signed, Perplexed. EPPIE: Dear Perplexed, forget the rules! If you feel like kissing him, do it. I'm sure he'll meet you halfway and race you to the finish. WOMAN 3: Dear Abby, for two years, I've been dating the man of my dreams. Last night he told me that he's afraid that getting married would take the magic out of our romance. Should I keep seeing him? Signed, Confused. Dear Confused, tell your Houdini you're going to perform one final trick... The disappearing act. MAN: Dear Ann, my girlfriend, who is 10 years younger, has suggested marriage, but she constantly asks me about my income and finances. My friends all question her sincerity, but if that's so, why does she worship the ground I walk on? Puzzled. Dear Puzzled, she probably thinks you're standing on an oil field. (SIGHS) I thought you could get VD. Off a doorknob. Shh. Watch your language. What's VD? It's venereal disease. Abby says the only way to solve these problems is to talk openly about them. Oh, really. Ann said the same thing about civil rights. What's going on? I thought they wrote about romance. Oh, they do. Look. Ooh, here's a juicy one. Birth control? (DOORBELL RINGING) Hi. BOTH: Come on in. Well, you know, having Life magazine visit me for the week, I didn't have time to make much of a breakfast for my family. Just the normal fare. EPPIE: There you go. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) Have fun at baseball practice. Go get 'em, Edward. Good luck on the history test, Jeanne. Goodbye, dreamboat. INTERVIEWER: So, how did you feel when you realized that both you and your twin sister were going to be in the same business? I was delighted. I said, "Congratulations. "That's marvelous. I am so happy for you." I have always been so thrilled for her success, I just naturally assumed she'd be supportive of mine. Frankly, I don't know what to think. I mean, I write something in my column, and two weeks later, it ends up in hers. Not that I read her, mind you. She has a certain Freudian flaw of character. I mean, really. How else do you explain the nose job? (CLEARS THROAT) "Twin advisers to America ripped apart by success." Listen to this. "She says, 'Love has always come first for me. "'I didn't have to marry a millionaire.'" Right here, listen to this. "I'm not trying to be the champion, "but it's like playing poker, "if you don't have to win, you get the cards." You know, if she didn't have to win, then why did she get in the game? Well, you could've expected it. The title of the article is "Twin Advisers to America Ripped Apart by Success." Oh, and then this! "I love her, but even I can't explain her irrational behavior, "though this book helps." And you know what the book is called? Hmm? The Hostile Mind. Tell me, what kind of a mind does it take to say that? She says, "I love her dearly, but you have to understand, "she's like a kid who beats a dog until somebody looks, "then starts petting it." Well, that's it! (SLAMMING) Sisters? Twins. They should take their own advice. EPPIE: Well, I can't believe what I'm reading. How could you invent those things about me? POPO: Those are the facts. You created the fiction. And after all I've done for you. Oh, don't flatter yourself! Well, poor Eppie. Hang on. I'll get you the number of a great psychiatrist. Yeah, well, if your recommendation is from personal experience, I'll pass. Oh, and speaking of numbers, Popo, lose mine. I already have. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (DOG BARKING) (JULES HUMMING) (HUMMING CONTINUES) Wake up, sleepyhead. (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) (SIGHING) Great. Good morning, honey. There's breakfast in bed if you're interested. (DINGS) Oh, don't tempt me. I'm racing a deadline. JULES: That's a race you win every time. Look, Eppie, about our anniversary, I was thinking... Maybe we take a few days off. You know, go to London, see some theater. Uh, you know, I've got... I'm speaking in Washington, and then I'm... I'm in Boston the whole of next week. I... Did you even mark it in there? Of course, for dinner. After 25 years of marriage, a quarter of a century, it better be some dinner. Look, uh, maybe... Maybe I'll go to London myself. A quarter of a century? Hmm. Sounds like a chunk of time when you put it that way. You know, I saw Mort at the business lounge at La Guardia last week. Oh. And how is he? They're doin' fine. Ep, I was thinkin' that maybe... You know, Jules, I've got this letter that's been sitting on my desk for the last two months, and it's two brothers arguing about some little thing. And I know exactly what to say to the guy. You know, be the bigger person, make the first move. But I... (STUTTERING) I can't answer it. I mean, Popo, you know, she says she's listening. She says she cares, but you know, no matter what I say, she is not gonna change. We're just gonna end up hurting each other all over again. Life slips by, Eppie, you said it yourself. You're the first to encourage people to try to get along. Maybe I will answer that letter, send a message, so to speak. "If your sibling isn't able to make the first move, "then be the bigger person "and take the first step towards reconciliation." Cool down. I didn't see your name in that column. Oh, are you kidding? It's got "Popo, Popo, Popo" written all over it. You're reading between the lines. It's my business to read between the lines. Bigger person, my Aunt Fannie. You know, it's just like I've been saying, and praying that it wasn't true... This is war. REPORTER: We finally caught up with this angel of the battlefield at one of the field hospitals north of Saigon, where she has insisted on using the same sort of transportation that the army provides to any normal GI. (HELICOPTER RATTLING) Now, for a few brief moments, these soldiers, nurses, and doctors serving here in Vietnam will be treated to the same sort of no-nonsense advice they're used to receiving back home in their local papers. Ann Landers, famous for her column on life and love, has arrived in Vietnam. Thank you. So nice to meet you. EPPIE: Thank you for having me. Hi, what's your name? John. EPPIE: John. Nice to meet you, John. How you doing, soldier? I'm a huge fan. Oh, thank you so much. Nice to meet you, ma'am. Take care. Well, soldier, what's your name, hmm? Corporal James T. Bale, ma'am. I smell perfume. I haven't smelled perfume in a long time. Well, be careful. I could be dangerous. Now, why don't you give me your folks' number so I can let them know you're all right. (CHEERING) Eppie in Vietnam? EPPIE: The heroism of these young men tears at your heart. It's up to each and every American to let them know, no matter what our politics, that our thoughts are with them as we pray for their safe return. Miss Landers will soon depart from Southeast Asia, but the question on everyone's mind, from private to general, is where does this lady get her energy? Got to hand it to her. Hmm, not bad. You know, I think we both owe our boys something. Hmm. POPO: The response has been overwhelming. (APPLAUDING) It all began with this one letter. Your holiday gifts for our brave boys and girls overseas has made Operation Dear Abby the proudest moment of my life. (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING) (APPLAUDING) Thank you. That's good. That's very good. BRUNETTE: Those letters to all those GI's. (HAIR DRYER RUNNING) That Abby has such a heart. But Ann right there in Vietnam. She is so brave. She's such a fighter. I mean, defending abortion rights, that's not easy. But she's still old-fashioned about marriage. "Always put your husband first. Never let him get away." (GIGGLING) Do you think they'll ever make up? (SCOFFS) That would take an act of God. Eppie, His Holiness wants to honor you for upholding moral values dear to the Church, especially your stand against divorce. Well, I'm not going to win any popularity contests with that one, Cardinal Ryan. How many years has it been since you first called me for advice? You've done a lot of good for a lot of people since then. You've earned this invitation. I'm honored. There's one more thing. The Holy Father is also a fan of your sister's. He wants her to be there, too. Oh, really? Well... She'll be delighted. I'm sure she will be. The Vatican is neutral territory. (BELL RINGING) (SIGHING) Popo, I... Your pin is crooked. Here, let me fix that collar. (MORT CHUCKLING) JULES: Bishop Monzari, I'd like you to meet... Abigail Van Buren. Ann Landers. We're so happy you've come. This way, please. You know, we all admire the wonderful things you've said over the years. As long as you're here, you might consider joining the Church. With all due respect, Your Excellency, the Pope will convert to Judaism before we become Catholics. (ELEVATOR DINGS) How's it been since you sold the company? I hate it. I'm too young to be retired. Budget Rent A Car was your baby, Jules. It's natural to miss your own kid. I don't know, Mort. I'm restless. Eppie's been so caught up with the move turning our apartment into a palace. I feel at loose ends. (SIGHING) Business still enough for you? Uh, Popo keeps me plenty busy. Yeah, they should be coming down. Thank you so very much, ladies. His Holiness was very pleased. Oh, well, the honor was all ours. (ELEVATOR DINGS) I can't believe you did that. How should I know the Pope's supposed to leave the room first? Uh, I wasn't trying to be rude. When you're done, you're done. When you're done. It's always about you. First in, first out. What is your problem? That I left the room first? That I got the invitation first? That I started my column first? You are never gonna let me forget that, are you? There are other ways to get famous. And you just can't stand that I am. You are so selfish. No, no, I am not. I am fine. (EXHALES) Look, there is nothing wrong with a person wanting something of her own. It's normal. Oh, maybe it is. You just need it too much. What do you know about it? I know that I am an individual. And I also know that I am not so pathetically insecure that I need to have a nose job to prove it. Okay, you have crossed a line, Popo. Oh, good. I went first... (ELEVATOR DINGS) ...for once. (CARS HONKING) When Ann Landers asked readers to write to Congress to support the National Cancer Conquest bill, so much mail poured into this city that secretaries posted "impeach Ann Landers" banners above their desks. (LAUGHING) SPEAKER: No stranger to the halls of power, Abigail Van Buren has lobbied on behalf of countless health and social issues. On drug abuse and alcohol recovery programs, on the rights of abused women and children... ...from Planned Parenthood to the Equal Rights Amendment, Special Olympics... ...the fight for racial and sexual tolerance. I present America's number-one advice giver... ...Ann Landers. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) ...Abigail Van Buren. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) I'm sorry I have that speaking engagement next week. Maybe I can get to London for a weekend later on this month. I can't believe it's been a year since I've been to the flat. Well, London's miserable this time of year anyway. Well, not with you. (DOORBELL RINGING) You expecting anyone? Mmm-mmm. (DOOR OPENING) JULES: Margo, what a surprise. We weren't expecting you. (DOOR CLOSING) MARGO: Where's Mom? Yeah, she's in the bedroom. Are you all right? No. What is it? My friend Sue just got back from London. Everybody there knows. What do you mean? I mean, you have a mistress, Dad. Everyone knows except Mom. It's humiliating. She's not a mistress. Please don't insult me. She's 25 years old. She lives with you in your apartment in London... All right. In yours and Mom's apartment! Not here. Do you think people don't talk? Not here. Not yet. I have fallen in love. (SIGHS) Don't tell me you're in love. I need you to understand. It's important. This isn't a fling. I don't wanna hurt your mom, but I can't help feeling... You know what, something? I don't care. You are humiliating Mom. Either you tell her or I will. When I come back from London. The day you get back. No longer. Marijuana? He's only 15. I know. I found it in his pocket while I was doing the wash. What did you do? What Ann advised, I talked to him. You know, I was so mad at him, I don't know how I kept my cool. You know, that Ann and Abby, they've got an answer for everything. Honey, I love your hair like that. Did Dad get home from London last night? Oh, poor baby, he just can't take those long flights the way he used to. I just made him an early dinner and he went right to bed. Did he say anything? I don't think the trip went very well. He's got some things in the works, but nothing definite. He bought me this. What, you don't like it? Mom, will you do something for me? Of course, baby. What? You've got to talk to Dad about your marriage. What about our marriage? Just do it, Mom. Please. Hungry? Oh, you didn't have to do all of that. Well, I can't take all the credit. Margo brought the pastries by earlier. What can I start you out with? Jules? (SIGHING) What's going on with you? Margo says we need to talk about our marriage. Margo, sweet Margo. True as her mom. Honey, something has happened... Something you're not gonna wanna hear. I've fallen in love with another woman. I didn't plan on it. I didn't go looking for it. It just happened. Now... I... I don't wanna hurt you. Jules, I wanna show you something. (SNIFFLES) Most women dream of owning a coat like this with their name inside. EPPIE: You know what I embroidered inside mine? Here, look. It's right there. America knows me as Ann Landers, but I think of myself as Eppie Lederer... Jules' wife. That's who I am. (VOICE BREAKING) Are you leaving me, Jules? Tell me you haven't been leaving me a little every day. I never believed in divorce. No. No, Ann Landers didn't believe in divorce. Well, Jules and Eppie Lederer are gonna have to figure something out. (DOOR CLOSING) (SOBBING) (SNIFFLES) (TELEPHONE RINGING) EPPIE: Hi, sissy? Eppie? Are you okay? Yes. No. I don't know. Jules is leaving me. Oh, honey. Oh, I, I am so sorry. Okay, I'm on my way. No, that's okay. You don't have to... Of course I do. How could I not? Oh, Popo. Okay, um, what can I bring? Just you. Just bring you. POPO: You got him three dozen pairs of underwear? Are you sure that's enough? I found Jules an apartment. Near the water, of course. This is a divorce. It's more like you're sending him off to college. Hey, you take care of a man for 37 years... I mean, he wouldn't even know to buy these things. Sissy, what happened? The other woman's not the issue. Jules is lost. He's... Ever since he sold his business, he's been searching and needs new conquests. He couldn't find them in the boardroom. You fill in the rest. That must've been hard for him. Very hard. Well, with all your success, he was probably jealous. Or maybe he just got tired of being called Mr. Ann Landers. (SIGHING) I mean, I'm sure it was no one's fault. My column is not at fault here. Why did you come, huh? To twist the knife in person? Of course not. Yeah, I wish I could believe you. Honey, I didn't mean any harm. Look, Popo, I'm sorry. I think having company was a bad idea. I just... I can't handle this. Eppie... (DOOR CLOSING) (SIGHING) EPPIE: This is the hardest column I've ever had to write. For 20 years as Ann Landers, I've come to think of you as my friends as well as my readers, so the news you're about to hear should come directly from me. Impossible as it seems to me, Jules and I are getting divorced. Jules is a wonderful man. He's always been kind, caring, and considerate. And that hasn't changed. No one can take away the magical years we've had together. A divorce is painfully ironic. How something so good could fail to last forever is a cruel mystery. And the lady with all the answers doesn't know the answer to this one. I'm asking my editors to allow the rest of this space to be left blank as a tribute to a great marriage that just didn't make it all the way home. (HAIR DRYER RUNNING) BLOND: Did you see the one about gun control? BRUNETTE: (SCOFFS) Sometimes I wonder if there's a subject they don't have an opinion on. Oh, you should've seen my husband. You'd think he was Mr. Sharpshooter, he was so angry. (CHUCKLES) I mean, we have a gun, but for 20 years, I've never seen him take it out of the box. You read him the article? Oh, I don't have to. (CHUCKLES) He reads them every morning... For 15 years now. He thinks I don't notice. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Where have you been? Do you still save your Ann Landers? A lot of them. Why? Well, do you have the one from last year, you know, the divorce one? Oh, yeah. Why? Well... Oh, no. Oh, honey. (SOBBING) Oh... No... (COMFORTING INDISTINCTLY) I'm so sorry. Good morning, dear. Mort, I need you. I've been sitting on this invitation for weeks. It's my 40th high school class reunion. Hmm. And the committee elected Eppie and me to be the guests of honor. Oh, that's wonderful. How's Eppie feeling about this? I don't know. You know, since the divorce... I think she's having a harder year than she wants me to know. I think about them all the time. Got married together, worked together, practically lived together. Yeah, well, you know, we've all been working so hard. So now you'll see her. I don't know... You've got to go. What if she doesn't wanna see me? Well, at least pick up the phone and find out. I can't. Why? What is it about this reunion? Mort, they invited us. Eppie and Popo, the twins. I mean, that's what they're expecting. And I would just feel like a fraud. I mean, we haven't been that in forever. Sweetheart, you've confused Ann and Abby with Eppie and Popo long enough. What do you mean? Don't get me wrong, the columns are great. They do a great service, too. It's just that you both got so caught up in the zingers, you forgot how to be sisters. (DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING) So, what time is it? Isn't it getting a little late? (SIGHS) I can't decide what to wear. The blue dress, definitely. Isn't that a little flashy? You're not in mourning. Look, Mom, I know this has been a tough year for you, but I think it would be a shame if you didn't go. What makes you think I'm not going? You haven't started packing. I can't. I know what's gonna happen. We all know what's gonna happen. Maybe if you talk to her. No. At least call her. If I call her, she's just gonna think I'm trying to influence her, one way or the other. What is she going to think if you don't call her? MARGO: Maybe she's going through the exact same thing you are right now. (BOTH SIGHING) Mom, when I look at those pictures in those old albums, I can't believe how close you were. We really were. Life was just so much simpler then. You know, we were just Eppie and Popo. (SIGHING) You know, whenever I think of high school, I... That's what I think of. But now, whenever we get together, there's always some problem, and we just end up hurting each other. Mom, stop worrying about what Aunt Popo is going to do. I know you've been looking forward to this reunion. You're being honored. Take a chance. Just go. Let the chips fall where they may.

I'd like that. Come on. Popo, I have a confession to make. I keep your "Top 10 Reasons to Smile" list over my desk. No, really? Oh, I read your column first thing every morning. Really? Well, second thing, anyway. (LAUGHING) Well, I never miss yours either, Ep. I love your dress. You know, I almost bought it. Oh, I almost didn't. (BOTH LAUGHING) Okay, sis, it's show time. I'm ready. EPPIE: Oh, thank goodness they were wearing nametags. I wouldn't have recognized anyone. POPO: We haven't changed that much, have we? Hmm... Just your hair. (CHUCKLES) My hair and your nose. EPPIE: (LAUGHS) Very funny. Mmm. What a wonderful night. My feet are sore. POPO: Yeah, and cold, too. I'm sorry. You know, I haven't danced like that in years. Well, sissy, we've still got it. Well, at least I have. (BOTH LAUGHING) Oh...
