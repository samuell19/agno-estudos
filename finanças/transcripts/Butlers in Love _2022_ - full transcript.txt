This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. [♪] Emma... You didn't even close the door! The carpool was late, and I don't want to miss the beginning of Plumshire Manor. [chuckles fondly] It would be so cool to have a life like that. Work for royalty, travel to exotic places, eat gourmet food, be in charge of an entire estate. Well, you can start by cleaning your room. Mom! All right, all right, after the show, hmm? [♪] Being a Butler here at Plumshire Manor is the greatest honor of my life. [♪] All right, everybody, your penne, ma'am, and your penne, and this one's gluten-free. Is everything looking good, guys? You're good? Okay, I'll be back with those two drinks. Okay, that's got to be a new record. What was that like 19 dishes? I've been practicing non-stop. Why? You know it's okay to take more than one trip. Mm-mm. At the butler academy, they expect you to carry multiple dishes at once with no tray. Of course they do. Butling is a lot harder than people think. [laughs] I'm sorry, what? "Butling"? That can't be a real word. It must be called something else. Mm-mm. The official term is "butling." Huh. Speaking of, have you heard anything? No. I'm hoping for an acceptance letter from the Academy any day now. Well, I'd cross my fingers and toes for you, but that would make me a very dangerous waitress. [chuckles] [♪] [takes a deep breath] [sighs sadly] [woman calls] Emma, you home? I got takeout! Yeah, I'm in the kitchen! Another rejection? Yeah. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. You look tired. You're working too hard. What time did you get home last night? I learned about hard work from you. Yes, but I was a single parent trying to raise you. You're doing it... Because the guy from the Butler Academy said I needed more service industry experience. Well, you put yourself through college, got a degree in communications, took three different language courses, moved back home to save money. I mean, you'd think that would be enough to get you in. Does this go with Chinese? Yeah, I don't know, it's red. Mom, these schools are hard to get into for a reason. Graduates from these programs end up working for some of the most important dignitaries, monarchs, and politicians in the world. They make, like, six, or seven figure incomes. I know, I just wish you didn't have to break your back just to be considered. You know, this one person in that chat forum I'm in made the point that butler school can be harder to get into than law school. Well then... try law school? Kidding. Look, I'm just... I'm just worried you're putting all your eggs in this butler basket, and I know you'll get in, and you'll go, and you'll be great, but I just don't want you to miss out on life while you're at it. I'm not. I'm not missing out on life, I have a life. Really? Yeah. Today, I hung out with Marie. At work? Doesn't count. Chow mein? [cell phone rings] Hello? Am I speaking with Ms. Emma Conroy? You are. Ah, good afternoon, Ms. Conroy. This is Charles Wiloughby from the American Butler Academy. Hi! [laughs in disbelief] I am calling with regard to your most recent application. Yes, I received your letter of rejection yesterday. Ah, well, there's been a slight change of plans. At the last minute, we had a student drop out, and if you're still interested, we'd like to offer you the open spot. Hello? Ms. Conroy? Are you still there? Yes, I am here, and yes, I definitely want that spot. Wonderful. Thank you so much. [chuckles] My pleasure. We shall be in touch, and, uh, good day to you. Okay, thank you so much. Okay, bye. Yes! [clears throat awkwardly] [♪] [quietly] Yes! [♪] [♪] [♪] [♪] - Oh! Sorry! - I'm so sorry. [laughing awkwardly] How gorgeous is this place? I know, I just can't believe I'm actually here. Same. Applied multiple times? Yes, and to so many different programs. Me too! I hear this one is one of the best, though. Oh, definitely. Congrats. You too. Hey, I'm Lisa Bolster. Emma Conroy. Hi. Nice to meet you. Do you know what type of butling you're hoping to do after you graduate? Yeah, my dream is to be a butler at one of those grand estates in Europe. Amazing. What about you? Yachting. I've been trying to get into it for years. The most successful yacht butlers all graduated from here. So cool. [bell chimes] [man's voice over PA system] All students, please gather in the entrance hall. Here we go! Okay. [giggling] Did you do the tour online? Of course. Five times. So, I've been working in a restaurant. I wouldn't say it's fine dining, but it's sort of fancy... [students all chatting] [claps sharply] Welcome. incoming students of the American Butler Academy. My name is Charles Wiloughby. I have dedicated my life to the craft of butling, and opened up this school to pass on my knowledge to the next generation of great butlers. These next few weeks will be hard and grueling. You will be bombarded with information and skills that you will need to retain immediately, but I promise you it will all pay off in the end. - It better. - I hope so. [laughter] Now, the hardest part about being a butler is balance, both figuratively and literally. The cart behind you symbolizes the skills that you will have to master. By the end of this course, you should be able to carry one full service in one trip. [students murmuring doubtfully] I assure you, I am not kidding. Is there anyone amongst you now who cares to try it out? See if there are any early standouts among you? Ah... initiative and confidence, two excellent attributes in a future butler. Thank you. Thanks. [sighs] Okay... One full service? Four plates? I believe that's what I said. Okay. I've got this. Two... three... [playfully] Whoo! I was a server for a while... - Oh! - [plates shattering] [clears throat shortly] Yeah, I'll call you back. I am so sorry, I was... I was on the phone, and I... Are you okay? A prime example of why butlers need to be prepared for anything and everything. Proximity to doors is always something to note, Ms. Conroy... Mm-hmm. ...and Mr. Walker... ...nice of you to finally join us. Hey, guys. I am so sorry. In your hands, you have a crisp, white shirt, Windsor-cut collar, along with a black or gray tie, which should be in a Windsor knot, always. Also, a vest, or waistcoat, with the bottom button undone, as per tradition, dating back to Edward VII. Smooth top, no wrinkles. Cufflinks are a must, and the shirt sleeve is the transition from the jacket to the hands, and should be visible two centimeters outside of the jacket, and we measure... [students chuckling] Are you really taking notes? Yeah, this is important... [scoffs] [clears throat sternly] When wearing a jacket, again, you should leave the bottom button open. Trousers should always be as long as two centimeters above the heel of the shoe. Shoe shine is available in all of your rooms, and should be used daily. You spelled "trousers" wrong. Do you mind? [clears throat pointedly] Sorry. There will be uniform checks. The first will be tomorrow morning. When you hear the bell, you will have precisely 10 minutes to come downstairs fully dressed, in pristine condition. Yes. What happens if we miss a button or we tie our tie wrong? Hmm, well, like everything we do here at the Academy, you'll be graded and tested. The better you do, the higher your class ranking. The higher your rankings, the more likely you are to receive a letter of recommendation. Fully one-third of the students at the Academy fail, so please act accordingly. Now, join the lovely Ms. Martin as she assigns you your rooms. Please follow her. Oh, Ms. Conroy, would you mind holding back a moment? It was chance that gave you your spot here. I hope you keep that in mind. Yes, I will, and I want you to know I'm so grateful to be here. Mm-hmm. Then please don't speak when I am speaking. In fact, chitchat is a slippery slope, and something butlers should avoid. 100%. I don't even know that guy. He's just some rude person. It won't happen again. I'm sure it won't. Off you go. Yes. Sorry. - [Lisa] Hi! - Hi! So glad we got assigned as roommates. Same. I feel like you're one of the few friendly faces I've seen since I got here. I think the instructors are just really serious people. You know that Mr. Wiloughby worked for the Swedish royal family for, like, 30 years. Really? That's impressive. I hope I get on his good side. You will. Hardest part was getting in. Now we're here, we got this. You're right. Thank you. I'm not gonna let some latecomer ruin the fact that I'm here, and I'm ready to learn. Exactly! [bell rings] Here we go! Lisa! [groans] Five more minutes. No, I don't think it works like that. The bell means we have 10 minutes to get ready and lined up in uniform downstairs. Is the sun even up? Yes! Shoot, I'm missing a cufflink. What? Already? Oh... it's so tiny. I'll help you look for it, but you have to help me tie a Windsor knot. Hands out of pockets. Your trousers are creased. Ah... good knot. Wrong button... Ah, hardly a Windsor. That is a Charlie knot, Mr. Archer, and you must shine the spots off your shoes. Spots? I don't even see any spots. Hmm! Therein lies your first problem. Hmm, Ms. Bolster, good knot. Do up your jacket. Uh, overall, too much space between jacket and wrist. Ms. Conroy, where is your cufflink? I couldn't find it anywhere, sir. I'm so sorry. Butlers don't make excuses, they find solutions. Of course. Retrieve your cufflink. In any household, a mishap like that could cost you your position. Ah, Mr. Walker, you're late. I'm sorry. Yeah, my alarm did not go off. It is early. Despite his tardiness, Mr. Walker is wearing his uniform close to perfection. Please all take note, this is how you should all look going forward, but that is the second time you've been late. Don't let it happen again. Yes, sir. Please follow me for breakfast. I shall be going over class schedules. So... can anyone tell me where the word "butler" comes from? Yes. The word "butler" comes from the old french word, "bouteiller" which means "cup bearer". In Ancient Greece and Rome, butlers were in charge of the household's refreshments. Yes, and do you know why this was? Yes, I do. Alcoholic beverages were stored in earthenware containers, which were considered very valuable to the household, so only the most trusted of servants were allowed to handle them. Okay, yeah, so they technically were not butlers. What do you mean? They were just servants who poured wine. Mm, no, it was more meaningful than that. Mm, no. What we now know as butling didn't exist until the 17th and 18th Century. No, butlers have existed since the dawn of hospitality, which can be traced as far back as 15,000 B.C.E. Oh, come on. It's true. The Lascaux caves in France were the first documented shelters in history where people accommodated others from a different tribe, so, really, butling is older than the wheel. That's a bit of a stretch. Actually, the young lady is correct. The role we presently play in high society dates back to when civilization began. Okay, right, the history is important, but the actual act of being a butler requires much more than that, right? Much, much more. [♪] Which side is the water glass supposed to be again? Water glasses are the left. Uh, no, the right. I don't know why I keep blanking on this. I've studied this. Salad fork comes after the fish fork. The menu you're setting has it as an appetizer. Yeah, the fish fork... It's the smaller one with the incurve. Precisely. I know that. No, Mr. Archer. Always make sure to measure. The distance between the water glass and the top of the knives needs to be exactly one inch. The bread plate goes to the left, above the other plate. Yeah, I know. I worked at a restaurant. All right, I'm just trying to help. No need, I've got this. I just haven't had to set tables under this pressure before. You think this is pressure? Just wait till we have to do this for actual royalty. Wait, what? Oh, yeah. Our final dinner we set and serve is for real nobility. Friends of Wiloughby's. Excellent work, Mr. Walker, though no surprise there. Oh, thank you, Ms. Martin. No, Ms. Conroy. The knife blades always need to face the plate. Look to Mr. Walker's as an example. Mr. Wiloughby will expect you all to set a full table for eight in under ten minutes by this Friday. [♪] [Wiloughby] A well-made floral bouquet can transform any room from the mundane to the elegant. Do butlers have to create flower arrangements often? My old boss, the Prince of Sweden, he used to insist on waking up every morning to the fragrance of the freshest flowers. It is a necessity. Fragrant flower. He's not even making a bouquet. He's looking at tomatoes. Maybe he's allergic to flowers? I don't get it. He doesn't want to be here, and he doesn't participate, but he knows everything about being a butler. [Lisa] Right? That Henry Walker guy? Yeah, what's his deal? He's a legacy butler. A what? A legacy butler. He comes from a long line of butlers. I looked it up last night before bed. His family has been butling for a duke's estate for over 200 years. Over 200 years? Wow. I think he's friends with Henry's whole family. That makes sense. That's why he's getting away with everything. Nepotism at its finest. Ugh, I hate that. Well, that doesn't seem fair. [♪] [Wiloughby] Although you'll rarely have to do the cooking yourself, it is important for most butlers to have a basic understanding of the culinary arts, and how to properly plate. I think your bread is burning. Oh, no. You used way too much butter. Thank you for the input. Mm, that looks wonderful, Mr. Walker. Oh, thank you, sir. - I'm using a peach glaze. - Mm-hmm. [sniffs] I can smell it caramelizing. And Ms. Conroy, what is it that you're making? I'm making a grilled cheese. With a Dijon vinaigrette perhaps? Or herb chèvre? Uh, no, I was just going for the basic sandwich. I eat out a lot, or I eat at work, so I don't have a lot of time to cook. Mm-hmm. Well, in order to excel at butler duties such as food preparation, table management, and stocking the household for the chef, knowing the bare bones is a must. Hey, add some apple and Gruyère to the sandwich, it will balance the burnt flavor. [♪] Is it true that you're a legacy butler? Glad to know my reputation precedes me. May I ask what, then, are you doing here? Same thing as you. I'm getting my butler education. Yeah, but it seems like you know most of this stuff already. You do realize this is one of the most prestigious butler academies in the world, right? Do you even want to be here? No, not really. Um, you're doing this all wrong. If you slice it a little thinner, it's much better for a sandwich. Did you apply? Oh, and if you add some mustard, this will bring out the flavor of the Gruyère. You didn't answer my question. Try this. Not bad. And yes, to answer your question, I did apply. Ms. Conroy... you're not supposed to eat the dish yet. [muffled] Sorry. Jared, that cotton has a sheen. You need to iron the other side of the fabric, and change to medium heat. I never knew this job required so much ironing. It's important. Is it? If an estate has a butler, surely, it has a maid. Mm-mm, depends on the estate. Usually, the butler is expected to prepare the tablecloths, but most butlers help their clients pick out and prepare their wardrobe every day. It's part of the glitz and glamour of it all. I'm sorry, I think there is something very glamour-ful about taking care of some of the most magnificent homes in the world, and managing those households so that those who live there can reach their fullest potential. Okay, I don't think "glamour-ful" is a word. and your tablecloth is on fire. Oh, no! This needs to be on a lower setting! [sighs in exasperation] Perhaps concentrating on your work, instead of debating other students will help you not burn down the manor. [sighs in disgust] [♪] [Ms. Martin] Today, I want you to understand how to pair wine with meals, and, most importantly, how to properly serve that wine. [Lisa] I swear I've been to a million wine-tasting bridal showers, and I still can't tell the difference between most reds. Tell me about it. My go-to is whatever's on sale, and sometimes, that's Franzia. [derisive laughter] I'm sorry, you... you drink wine from a... from a box? I mean, sometimes, when the occasion calls for it. What, uh, what occasion could possibly call for that? You got home late from work, you made some popcorn, you poured yourself a glass of wine. Why? What's your go-to, some rare bottle from 1912? I mean, while the 1912 Rebello Valente Port is really good, I'm sure you'd agree, Ms. Martin, right? But, you know, I usually don't have three grand lying around. Do you? [chuckles] Now, Henry, do you know the difference between contrasting pairing and congruent pairing? Oh, sure, of course, yeah. So, contrasting pair, they create balance by putting differing flavors and tastes together, and congruent pairing creates balance by, um, how do you say it... amplifying shared flavor compounds. I can see why Mr. Wiloughby spoke so highly of you. Now take up the bottle in front of you. Eventually, we will work up to synchronized pouring, but we will start with mastering the basics. We got this. Getting wine into a cup has never been a problem for me. [laughs] A butler must pour with confidence. Hesitation will result in a mess. Always have a napkin or cloth to catch any drips. Always have the label facing the guest. Always hold from the bottom of the bottle. Only pour to one third of the glass to allow the wine to aerate, and end with one swift twist to cut the pour, and always return to ready position with one arm behind your back when you finish. I want to see your perfect pours, and remember, always approach your guest and their wine glass from the right-hand side. You just stained a client's cuff. Sorry. Hold the bottle up higher, Ms. Conroy. Yeah. It's like this. No, I... [gasps] Oh! Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened. A butler moves quickly to clean up any mess, especially one they made. Sorry, I just... I'll use your... Club soda, stat! Right. Take him to the kitchen. [sighing] I can't believe I just did that. It's okay, it was just a mistake. No, every little thing counts. I've seen her making marks on her grading sheet... Just calm down. It's just a couple marks, it's not a big deal. I've made so many avoidable mistakes already, I could easily fail, and unlike you, I actually want to graduate. Okay, well, I want to graduate, too. No, you don't. You've already told me you don't want to be here. Yeah, I don't want to be a butler. Every member of my family has gone to an academy like this, so I... I feel like I have to go, follow tradition. What would you rather do? Cook. Be a chef. Open my own restaurant. Cool. Yeah. You're starting to make a little more sense. What do you mean? Well, my first impression of you was that you thought you were too cool for butler school. Yeah, that part's true. It's very true. You're just like the rest of us. How? You're trying to find your path without hurting anyone or letting anyone down in the process. You missed a spot. Actually, you missed, like, 20 spots. Yeah, I don't know what to tell you. Ms. Conroy, you're one of a few students I wanted to talk to regarding your rankings thus far. If you continue at this present level, I simply can't pass you. I don't know why I'm not nailing it. It's like I get nervous, and I have stage fright or something when it comes to the tasks I thought I had a handle on. Hmm. Well, you must devise a way to overcome this, and quickly. A butler has to be alert, sharp, and ready to focus on the moment at hand. I will do my best. Good. That's all, then. You wanted to see me? Yes, please, take a seat. [Henry] Yes, of course, I will. Fine. Okay. I will. Bye. Everything okay? Yeah. I didn't realize anyone else was down here. I was just practicing the table settings for the quiz tomorrow. Who were you talking to? My dad. He's just checking in on me, making sure everything is going smoothly... Mm. ...and that I'm excelling. Have you ever told your parents that you don't actually want to be a butler and that you'd rather be a chef? [laughs ruefully] Oh, yes. Many times. It has not gone well. It's much easier said than done. My parents and my grandfather simply won't hear of it, at all. They've been in this line of work for generations. My mom's American, I went to school here, but she has bought into this whole thing as well. It's some family business. [sighs] Yeah. I don't know what I would do if someone told me I couldn't pursue the career I wanted. What, being a butler? Yeah. And this is all because of that TV show you were telling Lisa about? Plum... Plum hire M-mountain? Plumshire Manor. [laughs] Right. Yes. I mean, the show planted the seed, but once I researched everything a butler does, and everything a butler gets to experience, I knew I wanted that life. Hmm. What? I just, I've never looked at being a butler as something you can aspire to. It's always felt like an obligation to me. Oh, yeah, no, there are very few jobs that let you be in a room with some of the most important people on the planet, and help make their day better. Okay, so the way that you feel about butling, that's how I feel about cooking. Though I'm a really good cook, and your butling is... it needs some work. [laughs] And just when I thought we were finding common ground. Goodnight. [chuckles] Goodnight. When Mr. Wiloughby says, you will have five minutes to set one setting in front of you based on this menu, you must also choose which wine to pair with the first course. We will only be here to observe and grade, we cannot offer any help. - We got this. - Yeah. Five minutes. And... commence. Okay. Whoa, okay, um, we have the tablecloth. You do plates, I'll do linens. [Jared] On it. Yup. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The salad plate is the one on the right. - This one? - No. No, no, no,. - The bigger one, the left one. - I'll go with it. And I'm gonna make sure it's one inch. Okay... [cutlery clanking] We have soup. We need soup bowls, You're right. Those are dessert bowls. Half the allotted time. Shrimp is... before salad. We need wine. Two of these... No. 25 seconds. What order are these spoons? I feel like we're forgetting something. What are we missing? Time. The centerpiece. Yes. Not only have you forgotten the centerpiece, but the choice of wine would make the shrimp cocktail taste metallic, and you completely disregarded the mousse selection on the menu with regard to spoons. I won't even address the state of the tablecloth. End of another week, Ms. Conroy. Mm-hmm. Did you eventually find the cufflink? Yeah, it's, uh... not looking so good. Would it be possible to get a new pair? I shall add it to your tuition. [sighs] [whispering] Where is Jared? I don't know. The latest class rankings have been posted. Please use it as a, uh, guide, and a motivational tool. [♪] [chuckling eagerly] Oh, not bad. [Emma] The rankings are up. Can I see? [♪] [Jared] Good morning, everyone, just wanted to say goodbye, I'm leaving today. What? You know, only like 60% of students make it all the way to the end. It's bound to happen to some of us. [Jared] Hey, it's all right. What happened? Mr. Wiloughby made it clear that I do not have what it takes to be a butler. [groans] I'm so sorry. Maybe you could reapply, or, I don't know, try another school? Yeah. Nah, sometimes, you just have to know when to quit. Good luck. You too. Thanks. Goodbye. [Lisa] I'll miss you, Jared. - Bye, Jared. - Goodbye. Let me guess, another late night studying? You saw what happened to Jared. You're like the hardest worker here, though, I don't get it. I know, right? In the classroom, I'm great. Subjects like language, and manners, and house management, I've got down. When it comes to food, or wine, or table settings, I'm terrible. I can't help you there. I got a 4 on my wine-pairing quiz today. I got a 2. You know who does seem to thrive in that arena? Henry. Yeah, that's because he has the advantage of being a chef, and he was raised by butlers. Maybe he's a good resource. Have you thought about asking him for help? No. No thanks. - Why not? - Because he's Henry. He's been driving me nuts since day one. All right, if you say so. Besides, he doesn't even like this stuff, he's just doing it to make his parents happy. Yes, but he's still doing it, and doing it well. I'm just saying it's something to think about. You could have your own tutor, and I bet you he wouldn't even ask for a fee. [♪] [Wiloughby] Think of it as a dance. One, two, three, four. [clapping a brisk rhythm] The best way to do it together is to form your own silent tempo. Now place the dish. And turn. Your other left, Ms. Conroy. Select your wine, complete the circle... ...and pour in unison. Wrong wine, Ms. Conroy. [exhaling nervously] All right. Once more. Uh, Ms. Conroy. a word, please? I know the passion is there, but you're making far too many little mistakes. I know. I'm trying so hard. I want to do better. You're trying too hard, that's the problem. You're getting in your own way. Perhaps you need a guide of some sort. Someone who sees these tasks differently. Like...? Well, I'm thinking, very possibly, of Mr. Walker. Oh. Don't be too proud to ask for help. Thanks. Is Henry really the best person to help her? Well, she has the drive and adoration for this work, he has the know-how, and the sense to connect to the moment. I think they rather need each other. Hmm. - Hi. - Hi. There you are. Hey. What are you doing in here? I thought the chef could use a few more herbs in his cooking. I was just checking it out to see what they had in here. That makes sense. What are you doing? Usually, you're in the library during lunch. Yeah, uh... [chuckles awkwardly] Well, I just wanted to say that... I know you're really good at all things to do with food and wine. Thank you? Yeah, uh... [chuckles awkwardly] the second part is... I was wondering if maybe, if you happen to have some free time after class, and you were willing, if... if you would consider... [sighs] ...giving me some pointers. You asking for my help? Yeah. You know, I don't know if that's the best idea. Why? Well, uh... you're really into the whole butler thing, you know, and I'm not that into it, so I don't know. I don't know if I'm the best teacher for you. Fair enough... but what if I could show you something that would inspire you to see how I see? We'll always be here for you to rely on, Lady Jane. Advising you means the world to me. This is unbelievable. Yeah, it's so good. No, it's not... Oh, shh, shh, shh! This is the good part. You are more than just a butler, Stevenson, you are my greatest confidant, [mouthing words] ...and my guiding light. Thank you, M'lady. Are you crying? It's just so sweet, the bond that they have. [chuckles] He would... he would get fired for being all up in her business in reality. We learned about this. Client discretion? - Yeah, but... - It's important. ...he earned her trust. [sighs] Okay, you wanna know the most unrealistic part of it? Not really. Well, it's when Mr... What's he called? Clump... Crumpet. Nobody's named that. When he falls in love with the town baker? [groans fondly] Oh... [laughs] That would not happen. Butlers don't have time for that. They don't... They don't have a life. I mean, your parents must have found time, they had you. My mother was willing to give up her entire career to move to the Duke's grounds, but I have plenty of uncles and cousins who never had time for marriage or for kids. It's easy to get swept up in the job when it's all about other people. I guess I never thought about it that way. Butlers make a great living. It's a great trade, right? Mm-hmm. If you are willing to devote yourself, your life, to the job, and to other people. I'm not going to do that. No way. I don't want that. I want a family, and I want kids, and I want the time to enjoy it. I have to plug in the computer, um, and the charger's right there. Oh. [imitating television butler] Well, let me retrieve it for you, Ms. Conroy. Very good. Let me plug it in for you... Uncanny. Here we go. Let me find the outlet. Hey, look. [gasps] My cufflink! Oh, but I already bought new ones. Well, now you have a backup for when you lose those. - [scoffs] - Ow! - [laughing] - Jeez. [♪] Well, it's past my bedtime. I should get going. Mm-hmm. Wait, before you go, you didn't really give me an answer about helping me. Okay, meet me tomorrow after class? Really? Yeah, say, what, 6:00 in the kitchen? Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. Really? - Really. - Thank you! Thank you, I'll be there. [imitating television butler] Good evening, Ms. Conroy! [laughs] So when anyone is cooking, the five basic elements of flavor are very important for pairing and balance, and they are sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. Okay. No, do not take notes. - No, no, no, it helps me... - Put this down. No, I don't care, put this down. It's not... I don't think it helps you, actually, because what it does, it gets you in your head, and you're not enjoying the moment. It becomes work, it becomes a chore, am I right? I'm definitely right. - Okay. - It's no longer enjoyable. You need to get out of your head and in your body. - Enjoy the moment. - Okay. - We're in the moment. - I'm in the moment. In the kitchen, we're living life, okay? Okay... You good? I'm good. [laughs] Okay, can you pour the rest of those for me? Yeah. How did you get so good at this stuff? Oh, you know, I, uh... I just lived in the kitchen. Always. I loved the kitchen, and the chef was... the chef was really important to me. I cared more about what the chef was doing than what my parents were doing. Oh, man, it just always smelled so good. It brought me a lot of comfort and solace. It was like a stress relief, you know? So your real life passion. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. What about you? Passion? Yeah, you have anything like that? Mm-hmm. I would say my life passion is setting goals. You're a very determined person. - I am. - You're diligent, right? Yup. You have a really strong work ethic. [chuckles] That's, like, not what I meant by passion. Passion is... It's-it's-it's this. It's this. It's something you do for fun. It's something you do outside of work. It's something you don't strive for, you just love to do it. I guess I never really had time for anything like that. I think that's the thing, I think people don't make time for it, but everybody needs to. Everybody needs to make time for balance. Where... Okay, so, like, let me ask you this, if you were gonna have a weekend off, and you were gonna have fun, and were gonna go out and do something, whatever it is, what would that be? I... Emma Conroy, having fun, what is it? I'm Emma Conroy, I'm having fun, and I'm... watching Plumshire Manor. You've gotta be kidding me. [laughing] I don't know. I'm... Plumshire? An old... It's a sad life. So, that's... No, it's not, it's just... If you wanna be good at this, truly good, and I know you want to, right? You wanna be great. You need balance. It cannot be all work. You, as Emma, need balance. Food needs balance. It makes everything better. And you, do you practice what you preach? All the time. But wouldn't you rather have a job that you love so that you can be doing what you love all the time? Like being a chef? Yeah, I... [stammers awkwardly] I just, I just can't. I can't. It's complicated. No, there must be a way for you to show your family that you're meant to be a chef and not a butler. Tell me how. I don't know how. I'm just... gonna think on it. Well, good luck. Mm... a delicious Cabernet. Merlot. Right. [♪] Lisa told me you wanted to see me. What's all this? Yeah, I had a, uh, I had a fun idea for a way to get you out of your head. So, flavor and pairing takes practice, right? Table settings, I've seen you do it, I know you can do it. You do it well, it's just when there's pressure, that's when you mess up. Yeah, you're not wrong there. So I came up with a game. A game? Yeah. We're gonna race. Randomly pick a dining scenario. The first to correctly set it wins. Well, what does the person win? N... A point. And what happens if you get the most points? You just have to wait and see. Okay? Ooh. Okay. Let's go. [laughs] I'm nervous. Don't be nervous. Just read it off. High tea. - High tea! - Yeah. You ready? - On your marks. - Yeah. Get set, go! [♪] All right, here we go. Make sure you don't forget this. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh... Cream and sugar... I've got it. Don't touch mine Oh, sorry, that was... That's my side, that's my side. I'm in control of this. No, I don't think so. Out of my way. - And... done! - Done! All right, all right, Conroy. You want to check mine, I'll check yours. Okay. [chuckling] Let me measure this. Oh... well done. Mm-hmm. Actually this is... this is perfect. Huh. Shall we go again? [giggles] Okay. Five-course dinner, plus soup, cheese plate, and dessert. [laughing] Okay, ready? On your marks, get set, go! Hey, that was cheating! And for the winner of today's table-setting race, we have my famous peanut-butter cookies. Ooh... Mm, yum. Seriously, you did great. Thanks. Yeah. That time, there was something about the competition that made me more relaxed. Is that weird? [laughs] No. No, you were having fun. So your brain couldn't trick you into freaking out. You just existed in the moment, instead of worrying about the next one. Yeah. Now I just have to harness that power in class, on quizzes, and in the real world. You can do it. I know you... What? What is it? Mom, Dad, hey, what are you doing here? We thought we'd drop in for a surprise visit. See how you're getting on this time around. Okay. Yeah, everything is going well. Why aren't you in class? We're on a break. I see. Mr. Wiloughby has invited us for dinner. Okay. Great. The Earl rang to ask if anyone could read him a bedtime story. I assumed that he must have brought his children, but... When Phillip asked him what kind of book he'd like, he said... "Something boring to put me to sleep." [laughter] We're all hanging out with your parents. Why don't you join us? Um, because the sooner I finish, the sooner I have to go in there. So I'm going to take my time. Oh, come on, they're not that bad. Okay, which story did he tell? It was the Earl story, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. [chuckles] It was good. I love them, but they do not stop talking about being a butler, ever. Nothin' wrong with that. Come on. Come on. [imitating father] "Something boring to put me to sleep." [laughs] Hey. Henry, come sit here. All right. I've missed you, darling. I've missed you, too, Mom. So, this is Emma Conroy. Yeah, we met. Hi. Hello. She's, uh, wanted to be a butler since she was, what, 10? Mm-hmm. Well... isn't that refreshing to hear. So where are you looking to butler after you graduate? Resorts, hotel? Private homes? Honestly, I would love to work in a household similar to yours. There's something that really appeals to me about working for nobility. Hear, hear. Did you hear that, Henry, very appealing? Uh-huh. Yeah. Henry has been helping me a lot with all things culinary. He's quite the chef. That he is. He's so good that, uh... I almost think he should pursue that full-time. Uh, yeah, yeah, I was thinking maybe there's a world... I was thinking, um... maybe I could cook full-time, you know, see where that goes. Nonsense, butling is in your blood. We've been through this. Your hobby can be food, but your trade is a butler. Right, yeah. Phillip, I just had an idea. You know, the Count of Kensington is looking to hire a new underbutler. Well, Emma? If you like, we could inquire about it. I would love that. Of course, you would have to get a letter of recommendation from Mr. Wiloughby. Which shouldn't be a problem. He usually writes one for all the top students. Oh, good. I'll get one of those. [chuckles] So, Henry, tell us everything you've been up to. [♪] Hey... saved you a cookie. Thank you. You're welcome. That was so nice of them to suggest a job for me. Yeah. Yeah, they're, um... They're great people. Have you ever thought of just going off and becoming a chef without their blessing? Every day. What's stopping you? Oh, I don't know, ending six generations of my family's legacy. Don't let your parents or the generations before them stop you. How am I supposed to do that? You heard them. I don't know. Show them. Just don't give up, okay? Conroy, you know what, if this whole butler thing doesn't work out, you could be a motivational speaker. A backup plan? Yeah. [Phillip calls] Henry! Time for your mother and I to be going! [sighs] Thanks for the advice. Anytime. [sighs] Hey. There you are. Hi. What's going on? What are you doing? I thought I would practice my place settings. I just made record time. Wow, nice. So, this is what you're doing on your day off? Yeah. You're forgetting, I'm on thin ice. Yeah, but come on, you're doing so much better. I'm glad you guys feel confident enough to go to town and take a break. I can't afford that luxury. Okay, what... Let me ask you something. What if I told you that there was a place that exists where we could go you could one, have fun on your day off, and two, learn some new skills, further your education, would you believe such a place exists? No. All right, grab your jacket, meet me in 20. I'm gonna show you! So this place has five different cheeses, all imported, and all properly aged. - Thank you. - Thanks. And I see each one pairs with a different wine. Yeah, see? You see? It's enjoyable, it's also educational. Imagine that. The perfect combo. Right. Uh, how about a toast? [chuckles] To pairing! To the perfect pairing. Ah-hah. I can fondue to that. Oof. Bad, right? - Bad joke. - Mm, not great. Little tip, the wine should always have more acidity than the food. So for example, the more bitter the cheese, the drier the wine. Mm, good tip. Mm-hmm. You cannot beat real-world experience. That's it. What? That's how you should convince your parents. Have you ever cooked for them? Here and there over the years. What about one big meal that showcases your talents? A real knockout punch. Yeah, maybe. Something to consider. Amazing, just this little store in the middle of the country. It's the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had. Mm... Also, take note, pairs well after any meal. Bien sûr. Oh! [chuckling] Wow... Beautiful accent. Somebody studied French. Yeah, it was my fourth rejection letter that inspired me to take French classes. Ah. The fifth inspired an art-history course because the Finnish school of butling said I didn't have enough culture on my resume. It's so crazy how hard some of these schools are to get into. Feels like it's harder to get into than Harvard sometimes. You know, I've dropped out of a few. Really? Yeah. This is my... fourth butler academy. Wow. You're so good at everything. [chuckles] I thought I could convince my parents that I wasn't good at anything, so they'd get off my back about following in their footsteps. On purpose? And it didn't work? No, they saw right through it. Hmm. Henry, I just want to thank you for today, and for helping me in general. It means a lot. Yeah, of course. I really enjoyed today. [♪] I don't know, I, uh... I like spending time with you. We should probably get back. We have a lot of work to do. Yeah... yeah. Right. Sorry. No, no, no, no. No, no, that... I can't have any distractions. With my ranking not being great, - I have to... - Right. I have to focus, and... Right. Keep my eye on the prize, you know? I totally get it. Don't worry about it. We're good, right? Yeah. Yeah, we're good, we're good. You wanna... You wanna walk up? - Yeah - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. [knocks politely] Ms. Conroy. Come in. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Well, somewhat, but nothing that can't be put aside momentarily. To what do I owe this visit? I wanted to inquire as to what I could do, potentially, to make you feel as though I... Out with it. [chuckles awkwardly] What do I have to do to get a letter of recommendation from you? The Walkers mentioned a position opening up at the Kensington estate, and it sounds like my dream job. A very esteemed position. Yes, very. Well, as of now, I can't in good faith give you a letter of recommendation. However, if you continue to apply yourself and successfully complete the final, I can reconsider. I would so appreciate that. I think collaborating with young Mr. Walker is helping a great deal. It is. Yeah, his passion for everything in the kitchen is really inspiring. [chuckles fondly] Indeed. You know, as a young underbutler, I, too, struggled a lot with the showmanship aspects of the job. Got a bit of, as you say, stage fright, myself. How did you get past it? By remembering there was a greater purpose to everything that I was tasked with. A butler doesn't exist to dazzle. A butler exists to be of service. Hmm. I promise you I will show you I have what it takes. Good. I look forward to it. Thank you. Good night. [♪] [♪] We have come here today so you can witness the role of a butler in a modern hotel. Later tonight, dignitaries from around the world will gather at this table for a five-course dinner. Some have brought staff from their own countries, but for others, the hotel butler must supervise everything, fulfilling any guest request. [Henry] Where does the ins... Emma, come here. This is Chef Shinkai. He's the head chef here. - Hi. - Hello. And I should get back to it. Scallops don't sear themselves. - My regards to Mr. Wiloughby. - Yes. Nice meeting you. You too. Bye. Come here. Come here. I cannot believe I just met him. I've... I've been following his work for years. You're totally fanboying! No. No... Maybe... Yeah, I am. I just... You should see what he does with a risotto. It's unbelievable. Did you ask if there's any openings here? I can't do that. Why not? First of all, I'm sure he uses a head hunter. Second of all, I have a job already. Yeah, one that you don't want. What's the harm in asking? I don't have the skills. I've had your food, and trust me, you have the skills. How will you know if you don't ask? [Wiloughby] Commence! [♪] I need two wine glasses. I'm on it. Teacups... - Teacup. - Got it. [♪] Wine. Wine. Check this... One inch... And... time. [♪] Perfect score. Okay... [gasping] I'm third? Congratulations! I mean it, you've been working so hard. I'm really impressed. Thank you. You're going to do great on the final! [Henry] Hey, Conroy. What's up? We're all heading into dinner. Come here, I want to show you something? What are you doing? [♪] Where are we going? I cooked us a special dinner, my favorite dish, Beef Wellington. Just for us? Yeah. A surprise celebration for you rising in the ranks, but you have to be the one to pick the wine. Okay, um... What do we have here? Well, it has to stand up to the meat, while still complementing the puff pastry. Uh-huh. So I would go with the medium-bodied Pinot noir. Spot on. Perfect. Well, I had a great teacher. Really, though, you didn't have to do all this. I wanted to. Friends like to cook for friends. I'm a very lucky friend. It's too bad. We'll probably end up working on different continents. [chuckles] Hey, don't tempt fate. We haven't graduated yet. There's always time to flunk out. [laughs] Yeah. So here's to... continuing success and, uh... [laughs] and to not flunking out. [laughing] To not flunking out. [clinking glasses] [♪] [♪] [Ms. Martin] Commence. [♪] What is it? This is the wrong red. One second. [Lisa, whispering] Hurry. [Ms. Martin] And pour. [♪] Thank you. [♪] I am happy to say, for all of you here still standing, you have passed this evening's graduation exam with flying colors. You are all going to be full-fledged butlers. [laughing in triumph] Ms. Conroy. Yes, sir. Tonight, you impressed me. You kept calm and worked well under pressure. As a result, my letter of recommendation will be off to Kensington first thing in the morning. Thank you so much! Earned and deserved. You're going to make a splendid butler. Thank you. [laughing happily] Oh, well done, Emma, well done. Thanks. Sleep well. Good night, everybody. Well done, you all. - Good night. - We did it! Good night. There you are. You sorta disappeared after we all got the good news. Yeah, I just needed a second to take it all in. I'm happy for you. [chuckles] I am. You did it. Thank you. I couldn't have done it without you. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm just grappling with the idea that I, um... that I'm gonna be a butler for the rest of my life. Ha ha. It's okay, though, it's good. It is. You've shown me so many good parts about the job. But not enough to make you want to be a butler? What about trying one last Hail Mary? What do you mean? Well, your parents are coming to the graduation celebration, right? Yeah. What if you ask Mr. Wiloughby if you could cater it? [chuckles ruefully] You do not give up, do you? [chuckles] Never. You should always go after what you want. Let me think about it. [Wiloughby] And so I'm personally thrilled to be graduating this fine group of dedicated young men and women who will soon be joining the ranks of one of the most honorable professions in existence, being of great service to others and representing the very pinnacle of decorum. Ms. Martin and I offer our heartiest congratulations to them, and wish them the greatest of good luck with their careers. So, how about a big round of applause? [♪] I'm so proud of you, honey. Years in the making, and here you are, getting everything you wanted. Yup, years and years. Yeah. Thank you, Mom. Who's that? Oh, Henry. I don't think I've ever seen your eyes light up like that. Shh! Mom, this is Henry Walker, and his parents, Dana and Phillip. Nice to meet you. You as well. I'm glad your mom is here for this. We were able to secure a position for you as underbutler to the Count of Kensington. - [gasps] - What? You... You were? Seriously? Thank you so much. I don't know what to say. Thanks. [Dana] We're happy to help. Henry speaks so highly of you, and we can see why. Aw... [Phillip] You're going to love Scotland. It's beautiful. Oh, I know I will. I can't even imagine. [Kelly] Scotland? Oh, wow, that's far. Are you sure about this? Yeah. Mom, I've been working towards this my whole life. Yeah. Mm, you're right. Ever since you were a little girl. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Have you tried the food? Aye. The sausage rolls were to die for. [Dana] And the sauce on the shrimp? Amazing. Right? You should try the crab cakes. [Dana] Here I go. Mm, it's delicious. - Oh, indeed! - Mm-hmm. Did the school chef cater this, then? Actually, no. No, I did. What, as your final, then? No. No, Dad, I, uh, I volunteered to cook the food for this. So well done. Really? Thanks, Mom. I'm glad to hear you say that. I'm, uh... I'm very, very glad to hear you say that. Of course. And the reason is... I was actually hoping you would enjoy the food so much that you would see why I think I'm suited for a career as a chef and not a butler. Your skill was never in doubt. That's why as a butler you can go further than anyone could. It's because of your many skills that you can truly control a house. [Henry] Hey. Can I help you carry those? No, no, no, I got it. You sure? Mm-hmm. All right. So this is it, huh? Goodbye? I guess so. Yeah. I'm going to miss seeing you around. Ah, I don't know. I don't know about that. [chuckles] I will. Um... do you remember when you fell and smashed all the dishes on this carpet? [laughs] When I fell. Nice. Yeah, that's how it happened, right? [Emma] Yeah, yeah. [Henry] I mean, maybe I nudged you. [Emma] Mm-hmm. [laughing] - Bye. - See you. I wouldn't have made it through without you. Yeah, you would have. You would've found a way. Mm... I'm not so sure. I hope you know that you're a fantastic chef, you really are, and no matter where you're working, or what uniform you're wearing, you'll be great. You gotta promise me something. Okay. Take a day off, like, once in a while. Enjoy your life. Okay. Outside of work. Promise? I'll do my best. Okay. Okay. All right. - Okay, bye. - Bye. See ya. [♪] [head butler] The grounds extend all the way down to the stream, up past the foothills on the north side. In the house, you'll be responsible for every room, including the master's study and personal billiards room. On your days off, feel free to go explore town, but I must warn you, as a new butler it's doubtful you'll get any time off. My first year, I believe I only had a single day to myself. Now, come inside, and I'll show you the kitchens. The last one, he said, "It's haggis. You eat it!" [all laughing] Oh, my... [sighs] I just don't know if I like Nice in the summer. Too many tourists. That's what you said about the Amalfi Coast, and you loved that. But that was different. We had our own villa. I remember that. Absolutely fabulous views. Oh, Positano? [gasps] Beautiful. It was our anniversary. We had a lovely time, didn't we, dear? I bought her that pendant. Aye. [sniffs] That smells delicious. Beef Wellington. It's the Count's favorite. - Aye. - Mine as well. - Oh. - Really? [♪] I'd like to propose a toast. [call ringing] [Kelly] Hey, honey. It must be late there. [chuckles] It is. Well, everything okay? Yeah. How did that big dinner go with the guys from the House of Lords? It went well. It was, um... yeah, exactly what I pictured. Okay, so why do you sound so down in the dumps? What if I was wrong? About what? What I thought I wanted. Well, then you'd... you'd be human. I love being a butler, I really do, but I... I don't know, I want to experience all of life. Look, whatever you decide, I love you, and I support you. I love you, too. Bye. I love America, but it's good to be home in England. Henry! - Yeah? - Come here. I want to make a toast. All right. Tomorrow is your first day carrying on the tradition of the Walker family, and I could not be more proud. Smells wonderful, honey. Oh, thanks, Mom. See? Cooking will always be a great hobby for you. I ironed your uniform. I know it's something you should do, but I couldn't help it. And... I think you should wear my lucky cufflinks. You must give Chef the recipe. No. Come again? I said no. This is my recipe, all right? I created this. I perfected it over the years, and I'm gonna keep it, and I'm gonna serve it in my restaurant one day. Henry. The night before your first day, you really want to go through all this again? Yeah, I do. I do, Dad, and I want you to listen to me right now. I want to be a chef. No, I'm going to be a chef, and I'd rather deal with your... your disappointment and heartbreak than live the rest of my life unhappy. I love you, all right? I love you, I really do, but whether you give me your blessing or not, I'm doing this. Henry... You are going to make a marvelous chef, and I want you to be happy. Thanks, Mom. [♪] Hi. Thank you. [♪] [car engine starts] [♪] Wait! Stop the car! Stop the car, stop the car. Wait. Henry? Emma, hey! [chuckles in delight] What are you doing here? I, um... came up from my parents' place last night, and, uh... I did it. I did it, I told them I don't want to be a butler. - Wait, what? - Mm-hmm. And, you know, it was, um... it was because of you. You're amazing, Emma Conroy, you know that? You are. You go after life, you set your goals, you achieve them, no matter what anybody says, and... [chuckles] you made me believe that I could do that, too. I'm so proud of you. What is this? Where are you going? Um... I decided to quit. [chuckles] What? Wh-Why? This is your dream job! Dreams change. I want to work somewhere I can build a home and enjoy a family. I don't want to give that up. I realize it wouldn't be a dream come true if I only got half of it. Hmm. A family. You know, it's funny, I mean, I was literally going to look for jobs around here so I could... maybe take you on a date on your day off. Well, I wouldn't have gotten any days off anyway, so... [laughs] Right. Another good reason to quit. [laughs] I don't have a job, you don't have a job. No. What are we gonna do? Don't worry, I have an idea. Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Huh. But first... [♪] I believe the kitchen is your jurisdiction, sir. I know, but suite 504 just canceled their chocolate-dipped strawberries and I really don't want them to go to waste. You know what pairs well with chocolate-dipped strawberries? What's that? Chardonnay, of course. Ah, very good. Very good. Speaking of good pairings... [♪] [♪]
