You know where the TV cameras spend most of their time? On those girls. The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. It's incredible. Two best teams in the country going head to head on the field, the TV cameras are panning to sidelines. Huh, those girls are the hottest thing around. Every guy's secret fantasy. How much lead time do we need for a cover? - What we always need, three months. - You've got two. I wanna put a September cover story. - Since when are we putting out a cheap cheesecake magazine? - We're not, but even a good serious magazine has to pay the bills. - Now you're caving into those clowns in the front office. - Those clowns in the front office sign your paycheck and mine. They want more circulation and I'm gonna give it to them. Besides, it's not just sex. There's a story there and I can smell it. - Do you have an angle? - I've been thinking about it. Behind the scenes with the most gorgeous girls in America. - Spence, do you wanna be smart? Laura's the one to write this. - Over my dead body. I don't even wanna talk to her again. Much less lay a hot assignment like this in her lap, oh no, no, no. This is very special to me. I'm gonna write it myself. Janey, get me a roundtrip ticket to Dallas, out tonight and back tomorrow. [disco music plays] - Come on, honey. Get out of here, you'll miss the signing up. - Maybe that's what I really want, anyway. - That's not what you want. And You know it. - Okay. [sighs] [disco music plays] Hi. - Hi. - I knew there were gonna be a lot of pretty girls here, but I, I sure never figured on this many. - Me neither. - Hey, come on kids, relax or you won't make it through the registration, let alone the tryouts. - I can't help it, I'm so scared. I mean just being here at Texas Stadium, even thinking about being a cheerleader. [sighs] I know I'm not gonna make it, but. - Hey, now what makes you two think you're not gonna make it? - Oh, well. - Do you really think we got a chance? - Definitely. - [Jessie and Betty] Ooh. [laugh] - And I outta know, this is my third year trying out. - Really? - I made it to the finals last year. - Wow. - [giggles] Right down to the final cut. There we were, all 53 of us, dancing our little hearts out. I mean, I was smiling so much, I thought my face was gonna crack. [giggles] And there I was doing the Saturday Night Stomp, those judges all eyeing me. I mean, I thought for sure I'd made it. And uh, and they um, called out the final numbers, and little Kim Everly, she just wasn't there. - I'm so sorry. - Oh, don't be. My boyfriend was so proud of me. I mean, he told all his friends that his girlfriend almost made the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders. He treated me like a real little princess, he did. - Wow, and here you are going through all this all over again just for him. - Are you kidding? That heel, huh. - Well, why are you doing it then? - I don't know. I guess it's the closest I'll ever come to any real glamour. [laughs nervously] [car engine whirs] [women mumble] - Ready for another season? - Yeah. - I'm glad you are because I'm not. - Oh, come on Tex. You remember the way it used to be? Eight girls going out to the Sunday games? And who would have ever have thought that it would have gotten to be this large? - It's amazing, isn't it? - It sure is, there's a lot of them. Ladies, can I have your attention, please. If you form a single line, we're going to be able to get you out a whole lot faster. How 'bout that, huh? Alright, now when you get back up to the registration desk, you're going to be receiving three pieces of paper when you turn in your letters. A copy of the rules and the regulations, the application, and a fact sheet telling you all you have to know about the preliminaries. Now you're to fill out that application in full, and bring it back with you to the preliminaries. Thank you for your patience. - Ah, Miss Mitchell. Suzanne Mitchell? - Yes. - My name is Lyman Spencer, I've been trying to reach you. I called you from New York. - Oh yes, yes, I got your message. Mr. Todd in the press office talked with you. - Yes, yes, I got his message too, but I wanted to come down here and talk to you in person about the article we-- - Mr. Spencer, it's a company policy. We don't accredit journalists to do articles on the cheerleaders without a detailed outline as to what is going to be in that article. I think you call it your angle. - I have the feeling you know we call it an angle. - I think you've made a wasted trip, Mr. Spencer. - Well, now wait a minute, you haven't heard what I have to say. Look, the article is gonna be truthful, upbeat glamorous, it's gonna be-- - And in writing. - Fine, I'll write it. - Mr. Spencer, I'm sure you have some marvelous arguments, and a great deal of charm that you're prepared to use on me, but you're wasting your time. - Well-- - Look at it our way. We haven't had too much success with some magazines. Now when the pitch is on, it sounds absolutely marvelous and then when it comes out, it turns out to be an unrecognizable jumble of distortions and sometime outright lies. Now I am not prepared to let anybody do anymore hatchet jobs on my girls. - I don't have that kind of magazine, Miss Mitchell. We do not do hatchet jobs. - No, I realize that, just put it in writing. - Alright, okay, that's fine, let's just say that, say that I put it in writing, how much time are we talking about? - Well you get it to Mr. Todd's office, and if he okays it, he sends it to my office. My assistant reads it, she okays it, she sends it to me, and if I okay it, I send it on to Mr. Shram. - We're a, talking about a couple of months, huh? - At least. Then we'll have to discuss it. - Another couple of months? - Maybe. - Okay Miss Mitchell, I get the picture. - I knew you would. Have a nice trip back to New York, Mr. Spencer. It's been nice meeting you. [whimsical orchestral music plays] [upbeat orchestral music plays] - And naturally now that the big design houses in Paris are turning more and more toward regional-- - Come on Phil, that's just mealy-mouthed business talk. Now you're a hot, young designer, and what you say makes news. Now I want a really tough quote to lead off the article. - And get every designer in Paris mad at me. - [sighs] They're mad at you already. I mean you're far too successful to have any designer friends. - Laura? They told me I'd find you in here. You look great. Well then, why should that surprise me, you always look great. - You're interrupting a very important interview, Mr. Spencer. - Ah, come on now. You can't still be angry about all the-- - Can I? Then why am I cutting out lunches, saving up enough money to have a contract put out on you? - [laughs] Alright, okay, so you're a little sore, that's not gonna stop me. We have to talk. - No, we have nothing to talk about. - Oh, yes we do. Excuse me. I wanna talk about you. That's your favorite subject. - You still know how to hurt a guy. - Now come on, don't get feminine on me. I wanna give you the biggest story of the year, Laura. I'm also gonna do something for you that you can't do for yourself. I'm gonna make you the hottest journalist in the business. - Go on, I'm listening. - Mm-hmm, I thought I'd get your attention. I really did mean it back there. You look sensational. - Come on, Spence. Just save the line, it just doesn't get to me anymore. - Oh really, could have fooled me. - Look you're handsome, you're charming, very bright and sometimes a lot of fun, but you're also like the measles, when you've had it once, you're immune. - Okay for now. But someday you're gonna have to convince me that you really mean it. Did you ever see the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders? - Who hasn't, they're everywhere. - Did I detect a note of quasi-intellectual disapproval? - Quasi-intellectual? - Now, now, don't fight it, make it work for the story. - But What story? You haven't told me. - The girls. The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. - And that is the biggest story of my career? [shoe heel clicks on floor] Oh, come on Spence. I mean, you've got to be kidding. - They happen to be the hottest thing in the country. They've a, they've hit some kind of nerve. Women from coast to coast are looking up to them. All that goodie-goodie, look but don't touch nonsense. I wanna cut through all that, that phony PR, and show those girls for what they really are. And you know why? Because I'm in the new business. My readers have a right to know the truth and that's what I'm gonna give 'em. If you had any pride as a journalist, you'd, you'd be dying to help me get this story. - No, you're not gonna talk me into anything anymore. Truth, pride, my duty as a journalist. Why didn't you say what is really is? I mean, you're circulation is falling off, and you're in trouble. The great Lyman Spencer, one step away from the unemployment line. Don't you think I'd know you'd have to be desperate before you try to con me into writing a story for you. - It's not a con. Alright, I know you're bitter now, but we meant a lot to each other once, right? - We never meant anything to each other. We were just both in love with you once, that's all. - Alright, you wanna talk truth? Let's talk truth. I need you for this one, Laura. How much is it gonna cost me? - I'm much too expensive for you now. - Really? What you'd get for your last article, $10,000, $12? - My last was $15. - Get outta here. You never made $15,000 dollars for an article in your life. It's alright, doesn't matter. I'll double it. You got $30. - I don't believe I'm saying this, but, ah... what do you want me to do? - I want you to get the inside story, behind the scenes. I want you to make the squad, become one of the cheerleaders, and then just tell it like it is. - With all the gory, sensationalized details. - Well, my readers are strong, they can take it. - Alright, you got a deal. - Oh, that's great. That is great. I'm gonna go back to the office and put it in writing. - No, you don't have to. [tape player clicks and whirs] - $15. - Get outta here. You never made $15,000 dollars for an article in your life. It's alright, it doesn't matter. I'll double it. You got $30. - Oh, it's not that I don't trust you, Spence. - You're the best. [disco music plays] [rooster squawks] - [J.R. Denton] Morning honey. - Morning. - You ah, still thinking about Dallas? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm still thinking. - Betty, I really want you to go up there and make that cheerleader squad. - Ah, J.R., I know it sounds like it's gonna be a whole lot of fun and real excitement and all that, but I just don't think-- - Now, no buts. I want you to do it as a favor to me. Being married to good ole J.R. Denton hadn't been the barrel of laughs I promised you'd it be. - I'm happy, J.R. - Maybe. - I am. - Okay, maybe ya are. And I gotta tell ya, there's no guy happier in Tyler, Texas than me. I can see the stirrings. You lookin' kind of wistful at all those fashion magazines, and the travel section in the Sunday papers. I can see ya thinking all the time. Maybe wondering how it'd be if you weren't stuck away down here with a guy you've been going with since we were both in the 10th grade. - That's not true. It's just that I, I don't wannna ever be anywhere without you. - Hey, just because you could be going up to Dallas and be having some fun, that don't mean you're getting rid of me that easy. We'll see each other every chance we can. I'll be up sometimes during the week, and I'll be at every game. - Ah, J.R., I haven't even made the squad yet. - You will. You're just so pretty. And when it's all over in a year or two, you'll have something to look back on and remember. And you won't be like your mother and mine. And all the other women around here. Old before their time. Spending their days thinking about all the life they could've had, if things had been a little different. - And there you are, enjoy your breakfast. Thank y'all. Mrs. Loomis? - Yeah. - I was wondering maybe when breakfast is over, could I have a couple of hours off? - You're going to those cheerleader tryouts, aren't you? - Well, if you'll give me the time off, yes ma'am. - Jessie, I've been meaning to talk to you. - Yes? - Yesterday, after you took off for the day. - Uh-huh. - A man came by looking for you. Asking questions. - Oh? - Yeah, like where you were livin'? What time you were comin' back here? A lot of questions. - Was he a big guy with dark hair, about 25? What'd ya tell him? - A whole lot of nothing. Well first off I told him, I didn't know where you lived, and you haven't been here for over a month, and I didn't ever expect to see you around here again cause you left here on your week's salary, I was dumb enough to pay you in advance. [Jessie laughs] Ah, I didn't like his looks. Reminded me of my third husband, and I told you what a loser he was. - Well do you think it's still okay for me to work here? - Sure, after what I told him, he'll be looking for you in ten other places. [Jessie giggles] Jessie, if I was you, I'd think twice about trying out for that cheerleader squad. They get their pictures in the paper an awful lot. - I know. I've been thinking about that, but I just been dreaming about for so long. - Well, sometimes you have to let go of a dream. - Oh, it seems like I've been doing that all my life. - You're sure this is what you really want to do? Even though you know that fella's looking for ya? [sighs] Okay, you can take off. - Oh, thank you Mrs. Loomis. - Ah, you don't have to thank me. I don't think I'm doing you any real favor. The best thing that can happen to you is that you don't even make the finals. - No. [children laugh] [bell rings] - Alright, I'm gonna leave this right up here on the blackboard, and we'll get back to it after lunch. Class dismissed. [desks squeak ] - Hi - Hi. - I'll take your lunch period if you wanna run over to the stadium and take a look at the competition. - Oh, no thanks. I don't think I could stand it. - Joanne, there is nothing to worry about. There's just no girl trying out today that's anywhere near pretty enough to knock you off that squad. I guarantee it. - Thanks, Mary Lou. - I'm still taking that lunch period for you, so you can get out of here and relax for a half hour. - You've got it. [children scream] - [Football Players] [hands clap] Break. - [Quarterback] Hike, one, hut. Go. [ball thuds on hands] - Hey, kick me one. [ball thuds on foot] - It's yonder. [Kyle grunts] [Joanne yelps] - Whoa. [Joanne laughs] - Geez, excuse me. Are you alright? - Yeah, I'm alright. I don't think my egg salad sandwich is gonna survive. - Gee, I really didn't mean to step on it. I'm sorry. - It's alright. I was watching the ball, too. Good kick, but not enough hang time. Now you could've run it back for a 100 yards or more. [laughs] And I've seen you do just that, too. - Against Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl. - Mm-hmm. - You know, after all these years, I still remember every foot of that 100 yards. - Oh, it wasn't that long ago. - Try a lifetime. - [Football players] Come on. [mumble] - I guess I better go. Sorry about your sandwich. - It's alright. [atmospheric orchestral music plays] [disco music plays] - Look at 'em all. - There must be twice as many trying out as there were last year. - Hi Tammy. - Hi. - Hi Joanne. - You just couldn't stay away. - Oh, I really tried but I guess it's morbid curiosity. Had to see for myself how many really pretty ones there are. - Just like the rest of us. - Sure are a lot of pretty girls in Texas. - What part of the state do you come from? - Jacksonville, Florida. - Boy, everyone's just dying to be a cheerleader in Dallas. - Not everyone, but little Ginny here is. - Why, I mean what's so special about being a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader? - I was Miss Florida in the Miss International Contest last year, finished second runner up too. - Sorry, I missed that. - Everyone missed it but not this time. Once I'm a cheerleader, those big TV closeups during the games and all the other publicity. - Then it's off to Hollywood in a blaze of glory. - It's happened before. - Hmm. - Hey, you know you've got a chance to make the team, too. - Oh, thanks. - And in as much as we're both going to have to relocate to Dallas, why don't we get an apartment together and split expenses? - That sounds like a great idea. - Come on, would ya relax a little? - Well I'm trying, but I'm so scared. I, I can hardly breathe. - Just give it another try. It's gonna hard making that team without breathing. [Jessie laughs] [disco music plays] - Good afternoon, and welcome. Thank you for coming. I'm Ron Chapman with KVIL radio, and on behalf of the entire Dallas Cowboy organization, we thank you for taking time to participate in these auditions for the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders. Before we go any further, I'd like you to meet the judging panel with whom you will be working today. Ah, on the far end of the table, prominent Dallas attorney, W.W. Mitchell. [group applauds] Right at my right, is the man, this is his office, he is the Vice President in charge of the entire Texas Stadium Corporation, this is Bert Rose. [group applauds] To my left, the lady we have to call the house mother of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, this is Suzanne Mitchell. [group applauds] She calls all the shots, and the girl that calls the dance steps is on the far right of the table, our choreographer Texie Waterman. [group applauds] Now, first thing we'll do this afternoon is ask you to come up here in groups of four, come up in front of the judges table. We'll ask you for your name and where you're from, a little about yourself, and we'll start with the first four from right over here, please. - Some of those girls are awfully pretty. - All rookies, that's all. Let's wait and see their moves at final cut time. - Hello, ma'am, my name is Jessie Mathews, and I'm from right here in Dallas. - Are you working at something now, Jessie? - Yes, ma'am, oh, I'm a waitress. - That's very good. - Morning. - [Texie Waterman] Good morning. - My name is Betty Denton. I'm from Tyler, Texas. I don't do too much of anything, really. I'm a housewife. - [Ginny O'Neil] Hello, my name is Ginny O'Neil, I'm from Jacksonville, Florida, where I'm a model. - Hi, Miss Mitchell, I'm Kim Everly. - Hello Kim. - Hello, my name's Laura Coleman, I called you this morning from the airport. - Oh yes, of course. - I'm a secretary in New York. - You're a long way from home. - Oh, most New Yorkers feel that way even in New Jersey. - They're are a couple really beauties down there, but nowhere near the winners we are, right? - [Group] Right. - And we're all gonna win this squad again. - Well I sure hope so. - No hoping about it, we're a winning team. - Three, and that's it. We left out anyone's favorite? - No. - Not for me. - That's good for me. - Okay, let's go. Alright girls, the judges have made their decisions, we have our semifinalists. Now let me point out that if your number comes up on the blackboard, we want you to come back here tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock sharp. Conversely, if your number is not on the blackboard, we hope you've enjoyed it, hope it's been some kind of fun for you, and we thank you very, very much on behalf of the Cowboy Organization for your interest and your participation. [group mumbles] [group screams] - Oh, Jessie, I made it, I made it. And you made it, too. [Jessie screams] - See what did I tell you, we both made it. Now, we're gonna do a little celebrating tonight, and I know just the place. I hope you got a real knockout outfit. - Yeah, I have brought along a head turner or two, why? - I heard about a disco place the cheerleaders go sometimes. We're gonna go there tonight and throw so real fear into them. - Now that's what I like, a fully developed killer instinct. - Developed nothing, I was born with it. [whimsical orchestral music] [dramatic orchestral music] - Good morning, my name's Kyle Jessop, I have an appointment to see Gil Brandt. - Yes, he's expecting you, just right through that door. - Thank you. - Good morning. - Well hello, Joanne. - I was just dropping my uniform off, I wanted to wait around and say hello. - How nice. [knock on door] - Come in. - Hello Gil. - Kyle. Hey, you're looking great. - Hey, you too. - I guess those are all the registrations for the new girls. - Mm-hmm. - And I guess I maybe wrong for putting you on the spot for even asking, but do you think I have a chance of making the squad again? - But I haven't lost it, I can still do the job. - I'm bettin' on it. That's why I arranged for that tryout. Kyle, we go too far back together for me to kid you. - Good, because I'm not just another over the hill running back scrambling to hang on for one more season. I can help this team, and that's why I don't mind going out there on an open tryout. I just wanna be sure you're taking me seriously, that's all. - But every year it just seems as if there more and more new girls trying out. They're all so young and pretty. - You have the same chance as all the other girls. - Yes, I know, but these last four years, well, they've been just the best four years of my life. I just don't know how I'm gonna be able to stand it if I'm not part of it anymore. - You show us something in that tryout, and you're gonna be busy Sundays running back kicks for the Dallas Cowboys. - Sure gonna be having to pave my way into Texas Stadium. Thanks, Gil. - See ya. - You bet. - Get on, come on get out of here, go back to work. What are you doing, playing hooky? [Joanne laughs] Out you go. I'll see you at the finals, huh. And ah, lay off the french fries. - Oh, alright. - Thank you. - Hi. - Oh, hello. We do keep runnin' into each other, don't we? - Ah, hey look, ah? - Joanne. - Look Joanne, if you don't have a boyfriend or husband who would object, I sure would like to make up for squishing your egg salad sandwich at the park. - Oh. - As a matter of fact, I can do better than that. How about dinner tonight? - Oh ah, well I did have some plans. - Plans you can change? - Sure, why not? - Great, I'll see ya out.

That stuff makes me tired just watching. Besides, I think I'd just rather sit here and be with you. - I was thinking, what if you make the Cowboys and I make the cheerleaders? You know the rules. - I sure do. - Well if that happens, we won't be able to see each other anymore. - Let me tell you a story. When I was playing at Texas, we had Notre Dame on the schedule one year, and some of the guys got really uptight about it. Finally the coach brought us in the locker room, and said, "hey guys, don't worry about it "until the time comes." - What happened? - We all stopped worrying and Notre Dame killed us. [Joanne laughs] Anyway, we both are gonna make the team, and we'll worry about it when the time comes. - Okay. - Hey, there's a table. ♪ Nighttime, maybe a hot romancer ♪ - Howdy girls, what'll be? - What do people drink here in Dallas? - Scotch, bourbon, gin.

Hey, what do you want? - Just came down to see you, I missed ya. - Oh, come on, Spence, be serious. - Maybe I am. - Listen Spence, I'm here on assignment, and you're the editor. Business, remember? - Yes, I remember but then after seeing you again, I um, I really have missed you. - I don't believe you.

But I am here on business. - Okay, business first. We'll ah, table the rest of it until all this is over. - Okay. Ah, are those all real live cheerleaders? - Most of them. - I heard this is the place they come to. - You still haven't told me what you're doing here. - Came down to apply a little pressure, how's the story coming? - There's a lot of sanctimonious, goodie-goodie, "we're just little ole gals from Dallas" junk being tossed around. But, if the real cheerleaders are anything like me new roommate, Ginny O'Neil, the girl in the print dress. Female piranha, just making a quick pit stop here in Dallas before blasting open the gates to Hollywood. - I knew they were all here hyping something. I can't wait for you to make that squad. We're gonna really blow this thing wide open. And we're gonna do it a month earlier than we figured. That's the pressure part. I moved the story up. You're in the next issue. - That's impossible. - If we don't jump circulation with the next issue, then I'm out on my ear and you don't get your $30,000 bucks. Now you wanna tell me what's impossible? - Spence, for a guy who's romancing me, you sure have a way with words. [disco music plays] ♪ Nighttime - What are you doing? - Studying. - Studying what? - About the Cowboys. Hey, you wouldn't happen to know what year it was they first went to the Super Bowl, would you? - What do you have to know that for? - I made it to the semifinals. - Really? - Uh-huh. And this is all part of the finals tomorrow. They havin' a test to see how much you know about football and the Cowboys Organization, and I'm gonna know just as much as I possibly can. - I really got to admire you, Jessie. - Me? - Yeah, you. I know a little about where you comin' from. The orphanage, all those foster homes, that fella following you, whoever he is. And you're not gonna let any of that stand in the way of what you really want. And I know you've been dreamin' about this a long time, and it does look like it could kinda be fun, but it's not just the fun and excitement you're after with those cheerleaders, is it? - Well it could be a little more than that, yeah. If I tell you, you probably gonna laugh. - I promise, no laughing. - Well, after a while it gets so they beat you down so bad that you start to feel like nothing. Really, nothing. But all that is behind me now. And I'm tired of feeling like I don't matter anymore. That's why the cheerleaders is so important to me. If I could just make it. If an organization like the Dallas Cowboys could say that I'm good enough to represent them, well then I can't feel like I'm nothing anymore, can I? [country music plays] - Now that's what I call much too good for those folks up in Dallas. - You like it. - What there is of it, sure. - I bought it for the finals. I figured if I'm gonna go up there anyway, I just might as well show'em what a Tyler girl is really like. [laughs] - You know, I guess this is just about the happiest I've seen you look in quite a while. - Ah J.R., I gotta admit it really is getting exciting. - And it's gonna be a lot more exciting once you make that squad. You'll see honey, you're really gonna have some fun for a change. - Oh. - Hello ma'am, my name is Jessie Mathews. - Jessie Mathews. - Yes, ma'am. - Right here, number 12.

Thank you very much, all of you. Now the next thing we'll do is break you into three groups. The first group, stay right where you are, numbers one through 25 because Texie Waterman will teach you a new dance routine. This is to see how rapidly you pick up on new steps. Numbers 26 through 50, we want you to take a written multiple part test. Now this is going to be to see your general knowledge of football, and how much you know about the Cowboy Organization, and the third group, everyone from 50 on, down in this area where Suzanne Mitchell will interview each of you. - Okay girls, let me have numbers one through 10 in two lines, please. Quickly. Bounce. Good. Take a deep breath. [inhales] And let it all out. [exhales] How do you feel? - Good.

[disco music plays] - Very good, thank you Cindy. - Thank you. - Hello Laura. - Hi. - Tell me, why would a New York girl like you want to be a cheerleader in Dallas? - I don't know, it seems like a lot of fun. - It's not going to be fun. It's going to be long, hard hours of practice, every night and on every weekend. - Well if that's what it takes to be the best. - That's exactly what it takes. - Well then I don't mind because that's what I want to be, the best. - Alright, thank you. [disco music plays] And you've had a four years of acting lessons? You know, there's not too much chance for an acting career here in Dallas. - All I want here in Dallas is a chance to be on the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders. - Alright, thank you. - Alright, can you take your seats, please. Thank you, your work is largely done now, and ours is just beginning. We're going to retire now and tally sheets and so forth, and there'll be some refreshments here while we're gone. We'll get back as soon as we can, and announce who the winners are. [group mumbles] - Tension's so thick here you could cut it with a knife. - Oh, you could say that again. Excuse me. - Hey. - Huh? - It's really important to you, isn't it? To make it to the squad? - Oh, it's just the most important thing in the whole world, that's all. - Yeah, I'll be really disappointed if I don't get in. - Ah, I just have to make the cheerleaders, that's all, I just have to. - Well, good luck. - Thank you. Good luck to you, thank you. - How was my dancing, oh, did I do alright? - It was just great. - Yeah? - How can you eat? You're not nervous? - Dig in, it's great spread. - No, I can't. It's like waiting for brain surgery or something. - [laughs] Sure are a lot of uptight girls walking around here. - Um, really. I mean there really are. [disco music plays] - Alright girls. The judges have reached their decision, and if you'll all take your places, we'll announce who the winners are. This is it. We've been arguing in the back room, but now I'm going to call out 32 names of the new Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders. I'll call the name and the number, come on up when I do, okay? Alright.

You're gonna be the best Cowboy cheerleader they ever had. - Ah, thank you. - And listen, you don't get too cocky now because I'm gonna come back here next year, and I'm gonna try to take that place right away from you. - You do that. - Well, Congrats. - Thank you. - Good luck. - Bye. - Miss Mitchell, all I wanna know is what's going on here? I've lost contests before, but I've been in so many of them, that I'm an expert at rating the opposition, and there are no two ways about it, I'm the prettiest girl here. - Yes Ginny, you're a very pretty girl. - And there's nothing wrong with my dancing either. - No, there isn't, you're almost a pro. - Then why? - Well I'm afraid I'm the reason, there's a little too much showbiz in your bio. - Oh, I get it now. No career minded sharpies on the cheerleaders. - Something like that. - So what, just means I'm off to Hollywood six months sooner, that's all. [laughs] [group cheers] [group mumbles] - Wanna stretch? - Oh please, I need it. - Oh, ah, I'm in pain. - Oh, thanks, ah. - Good morning ladies. Could you gather around please? I would like to congratulate you on behalf of the Dallas Cowboys Organization. [group applauds] Now you all have a unique responsibility, and it's up to every one of you to live up to it. You were given a copy of the rules and the regulations when you registered. And we expect you to adhere to those. First of all, you must live in the Dallas/Ft Worth area. You must have a regular job or be going to school. There will be rehearsals every night of the week. [group groans] And on weekends. [group groans] If you miss one rehearsal prior to a home game, you're not going to be allowed to be in that game. You miss two rehearsals, and you're not going to be a cheerleader. Two games and your out. Okay? Alright, now you're going to be taking care of your own uniforms. You new girls will be fit next week. You returning girls will get the same ones back that you had last year and they better fit. [group laughs] Now there's something that I want you to remember, and you must never forget. When you're in those uniforms, you are representing the Dallas Cowboys Organization. You have a duty to do it well and keep our image. Okay, one thing I want you to be aware of. I promise to be your very best friend. I can also be your worst enemy. So work hard, huh? Okay, let's get to work. Let's do it - Okay girls, up. Four lines please. Quickly. [atmospheric music plays] And right foot, point out. Step across and brush the foot up. Step out and fall back. When you fall back, put those hands up. Push back as the elbow comes back. Hip comes up, and push. And put the hand up. Slap and groove. That's it, alright let's try it. Foot out. And step across, brush up. Step, fall back. And push, push, up and slap. And let's try again. Ready, and step, brush up. Step, fall back, push, push, up. Up here, and slap. That's it, good. - Alright. - Again, foot out. And a one, two, three, four. Five and six. Seven and eight. Again, foot out, and ah, one. Two. Three. Four. Five. And Six. Seven, and eight. But faster. Alright now, Betty. - Yes? - When you kick up, I want that toe pointed. - Oh yes. - Alright. One out again, let's go. - I am wiped out. - [laughs] I'll see you tomorrow, bye bye. - Can I have your autograph? - Oh sure. Here we go. There ya go. - Thank you. - Sure. - Laura, you sure it isn't any bother? - Bother? You're doing me a big favor. I took on that apartment figuring I'd share it with Ginny O'Neil. She didn't make it through the finals so now I'm stuck with a place that's bigger than I need. - Can I have your autograph? - Sure. - Sure, what's your name? - Chris. - Jonathan. - Well, I do need a place to live in Dallas. - Well then, that's settled. - Thank you. - You're moving in with me. - Thanks a lot. - Oh, Laura. I mean, you know I can't afford very much. Besides, you haven't even told me how much my share of the rent's gonna be. - Well don't worry about it, we'll work it all out. The main thing is that we get to be friends, and we get to know all about each other. You know like a, in a sorority house, all the girls sitting around, telling about themselves? - [laughs] I'm afraid I don't have very much to tell. - You'd be surprised. [ominous music plays] - Hello Jessie. I've been looking all over for ya. Now look what a celebrity you are, picture in the paper and everything. - Now Frank, you just leave me alone. - Jessie, oh Jessie, after all we've been through together, how can I leave you alone? - Hello Jessie, everything alright? - Yeah, sure, Jessie and me are just old friends. Stopped by to say hello, and to congratulate you on being picked for the cheerleaders. I'll see you, Jessie. - [ Suzanne Mitchell] There anything you wanna tell me? - No, ma'am. - Jessie, if he's bothering you, if anybody bothers you, I want you to come to me. Do you understand? - Thank you, Miss Mitchell. - Suzanne. - Thank you, Suzanne. - Okay. [ominous music plays] [upbeat music plays] - [knock on door] It's Laura. - Oh, come on in. - How's it going? - [Betty Denton] Ah, Laura, it's the best that's all. I never had a bath like this before. - You haven't? - Uh-uh. - It's a women's right. It should be part of the ERA. - The what? - Oh, the Equal Rights Amendment. - Oh, I guess I should know all about that, but I, I'm sorry, I don't. - But you do know all about the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. - Ah, I know that doesn't sound too smart to a New York City girl like you. I guess I'm just a, a simple Texas housewife, that's all. - Well all that's going to change. You're in Dallas now. You're gonna have to get out there and see a whole lot more of the world. [upbeat music plays] Hi Spence, well nothing startling yet. So far just a go-getter who's speech from the iron butterfly who's in charge, and a really bone-crushing four hour rehearsal. First of what I fear is gonna be many. I've ah, roped in one of the cheerleaders into sharing the apartment with me. So far all I've gotten from her is enough sugar and molasses to kill four diabetics. [phone rings] - Hello. - [Frank Rand] Mr. Lyman Spencer? - You got him. - My name is Frank Rand, I'm calling from down here in Dallas, and I heard that you might be willing to pay for some dirt on the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders? - Where'd ya hear something like that? - Ah, from a friend of mine. You spread word around pretty good when you were down here. Now ah, how much money are we talkin'? - That depends on what you got to sell. - I've got a girl who just made the cheerleader squad, special pictures, inside dirt, well you just name it and you got it. Naturally, providing the price is right. - Naturally. And if there's no inside dirt? - Oh, you just write up anything you want. I'll get her to swear it's all true, every word of it. [ominous orchestral music plays] - Mr. Rand, I think you just made yourself a deal. [children mumble] - Now you have a nice lunch. - Hello Joanne. - Hello Kyle. - You're a mighty tough lady to reach, I've been calling a lot. - Well, you know how practice is. We seem to be at it all the time. - I've left messages, you too busy to make a phone call? - Kyle, I've been thinking, and well I just don't want to see you anymore. - I didn't make the Cowboys, you know that. - Yes, I know. - Then you're gonna have to tell me the reason why you won't see me. - Please Kyle, I just don't want to... Isn't that enough? - No, it isn't. There's gotta be a reason, and I wanna know what it is. I'm not moving until I get my answer. - Alright, I'll see you tonight after rehearsal. I'll tell you then. - Tonight. [upbeat music plays] - [Betty Denton] Oh, oh. [Betty laughs] [Better applauds] - Thank you. Bye. Oh, you know, I really could get used to all this. - Well it's not too hard to take. - Want some more wine? - Mmm. I guess we better start looking for jobs. Either that or we're gonna have to face up to Suzanne, and tell her why we're not working. - Well quick, where's that Want Ad section? - What can you do? - Oh, I don't know. Not too much of anything, I guess. - Can you type? - Just a little. - Well you don't have to worry about it, you've got legs of a great secretary. - Oh, thank you. Wait Laura, do you really think I could get a job in an office? - I guarantee it. - Oh, I sure hope so. - Betty, I hope you don't mind me asking this, but what are you doing here? You love your husband, and it sounds as if he loves you, too, I mean shouldn't you be back home in Tyler making babies? - Oh, well, J.R. says there's plenty of time for that. - What else does J.R. say? - Well I, I guess you must have figured by now, it isn't my idea of being on the cheerleaders. It's just that J.R. wants it so bad for me. - For you? - Well it's a lot for J.R. too. - Why? I mean, what's so important about all this? - I don't know, I don't know, maybe he, maybe he feels it'll make him stand a little taller with some of his friends, you know? And all the people he does business with. - [sighs] Sounds just like a lot of macho garbage to me. - Oh no, Laura, no it isn't. No, he wants it for me, too. He wants me to have some fun and meet new people, maybe have some exciting times, you know? - Well Betty, that's just exactly what you're gonna be doing for the next year. Going out, having some fun. Meeting a lot of attractive young men. I mean, aren't you a little afraid of the wear and tear that's gonna put on your marriage? - Nah, I'm not just a little afraid, I'm terrified. - Hello Jessie, I've been waiting for ya. - Frank, you've just got to leave me alone. - I don't have to do anything. Come on Jessie, I just wanna talk. - Frank, I'm gonna be late for rehearsal. - Oh, come on, Jessie. We're just gonna talk. - Will you let me go? - Sure. If that's what you really want. Sure is good to see you again, Jessie. - Frank, that is not what you came here to talk to me about. - You know Jessie, things haven't been going too good for me lately. Had a couple of deals I thought might happen, but they just kinda blew apart at the last minute. - Hmm, what else is new? - Well I figure I used up all my luck here in Dallas. Maybe I'll head to LA, Vegas. That's why I started looking for you. See if you wanna come along with me, and then here you are, big shot Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader. - Frank, my being a cheerleader has nothing to do with you. - Yeah, sure. - Frank, what are you thinking of doing? - Me? Nothing. You're the one who's gonna do it for us. - I'm not doing nothing. - Oh, yes you are. - Frank, Frank. Frank! - Now first you're gonna get some pictures taken, you're gonna be the only topless/bottomless Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader. We're gonna make a fortune. - Frank, I'm not gonna do any of it. - Okay, alright have it your own way, but then me being a loyal Dallas Cowboy fan, I'm gonna have to tell them all about you. All about us. - Oh, Frank. Frank, please don't do this to me. - You either do what I want, or I'm gonna tell them everything. Either way you're off the cheerleaders, so let's at least make some money. [ominous orchestral music plays] - [Texie Waterman] Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Two, two, three. - Tina, Keep your head up. seven, eight, let's go girls. - Betty straight line.

Now Joanne and Jessie, I don't know where your minds are, but I sure wish they were back here telling your feet what to do. [group laughs] Come on ladies, that's not funny. It really isn't. In one week's time, we walk out in the middle of Texas Stadium to make complete fools out of ourselves. Now let's be serious, and smile and sell, now come on, let's go. - [Texie Waterman] One, two, three, four reach out, push those poms poms. Let's go. Jessie, get those arms up straight.

[crickets chirp] [knock on door] - Hi. - Evening, ma'am. I'm looking for Mrs. Betty Denton. - This is the place. I'm Laura Coleman, and you just have to be J.R. - That's right, glad to meet you ma'am. This sure is a fancy place. - J.R., oh. I'm just so glad to see you. - Oh, don't mind me. I'm just gonna get dressed and get out of here. - I know it sounds crazy, but after practicing dancing for four hours every single night, we come home, we rush out again to do some more dancing. - You're not rushing anywhere tonight. You and J.R. just stick around and get reacquainted. - Now that sounds like a real nice idea. - Oh, come on J.R. There's this really cute little disco all us cheerleaders go to, you'll just love it. It's real nice. Besides, we got plenty of time to get reacquainted later on. - Yeah, sure. - Okay, let me just get ready, okay? - Okay. [disco music plays] - Oh, I want you to meet some of my friends. Hi. - Hi. - This is my husband J.R. - Hi. - This is Tammy and Michelle, and up there there's Connie and Kim and Suzan. This is my husband J.R. - Hi Betty, how about a dance? - Sure, okay. - Excuse us for a second. - I'll be right back. [disco music plays] - Joanne, it just doesn't make sense. - I'm sorry, it's the way I feel. - What kind of answer is that? - I can't help myself. Kyle, I do like you, and I know we have fun together, but-- - But? Look I know it's only been a couple of weeks, but Joanne, I love you. [disco music plays] It can't be that I'm not some kind of glamorous jock anymore. - Oh no, it's not that. - Look, football has given me a good college education, I've made some good investments, I can take care of you. - It's not that either. - Well then what is it? - I can't help myself. Kyle, I want so badly to keep on being on the cheerleaders, and every time I think of you-- - I get it, I didn't make the Cowboys. So I'm a constant reminder of what it's gonna be like for you next year or the year after when you don't make the team. I thought I knew you better than that. How can you be so shallow? - I know it sounds shallow, but I don't know, maybe I'm just scared. - Scared? Of what? - I don't know. Maybe just gettin' old.

I'm gonna call Suzanne first thing in the morning and, maybe she'll let me live at home in Tyler, and that way I could just drive back and forth for the rehearsals and the games. - But that'd be a 100 miles of driving each way. - So what?

Well I've been really into it, and there just is no story. The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders are everything that their PR says they are. They're just a lot of nice, down home girls having some fun. And as far as, as far as they're concerned, they're no nationwide phenomenon. They're just themselves. - They've really gotten to you, haven't they? - I guess so. I've even made some friends. - Please, you'll have me in tears. - Believe me, Spence. There is no story. Please, for me, let it lie. - No, I told you I was gonna blast all this goodie-goodie girl next door con, and I'm gonna do it. It's gonna be expensive though, but worth every penny.

I just can't go through with what he wants. - Well what does he want you do? - He wants me to pose for some dirty pictures, and then swear to some terrible lies about the cheerleaders for some magazine. - [sighs] Spence. - Well, I just gotta run. I can't pose for those pictures and if I don't, then Frank's just gonna tell some terrible things about me. - Lies? - No, the truth about how Frank and I ran away from one of those foster homes together, and how we held up some gas stations, and how I went to reform school for it, and he went to prison. So see I'm just gonna get kicked off the cheerleaders anyway. - You must have been awfully young? - Well, I was 15. - Well no one is gonna hold that against you now. - But Frank's never gonna leave me alone, and that magazine's gonna go ahead and print all those lies anyway. - Maybe not. First of all we're gonna get you out of here. - No, I don't-- - There's no two ways about it. You're moving in with me. I insist, now come on. - Well, okay. - Then we're gonna see about your friend Frank, and my friend Spence. [dramatic orchestral music] - Come in. Laura, my you're up early. - Well there's some things I have to talk to you about. - Alright, have a seat. - No thanks, I'll stand. I uh, I may have to beat a hasty exit. - Confession time? Well I always find it best if you just start from the top. - Well, first of all I, I wasn't a secretary in New York, I'm a reporter, and I was sent down here to do a hatchet job on you and the cheerleaders from the inside. Well aren't you gonna throw me out of here? - I might when you finish. Right now I wanna hear the rest of it. - Well for whatever reasons, I'm not gonna do the story. - Out of curiosity, why? - I don't know, I've learned a lot about you and Texie and the other girls. Maybe even something about myself. In any event, I'm not doing it, but my editor is still determined to have a sizzling front cover story, and he's not too particular about the truth, and that's where Jessie comes in. - Jessie Mathews? - He and some creep out of her past are pressuring her into some exploitation pictures, and a byline story full of a whole lot of lies about the cheerleaders. And that's why Jessie didn't come to practice. She wouldn't do anything to hurt any of you, and she was ready to run away before I stopped her. I told her there was no need to run away. That you wouldn't hold anything that she did at age 15 against her. - Age 15, probably not, but I'd like to hear it first. - Good. Well if you're game, I think I have a way of getting these creeps off your back and Jessie's. - How? - Do you know any local cops? [slow jazz music plays] [camera clicks] - That's good, that's good, alright, now. Now why don't you move your legs over to the side. Make them look really nice, that's it, that's it. Smile now, look sexy, alright? Good. Rand, alright Rand. [camera clicks] That's it, alright. One more like that, that's fine. - Frank. [camera clicks] - Good, now tell her to take off the vest. - Jessie, take off your vest. - Frank, please. - Which one of you is Lyman Spencer? - He is. - Who are you? - Beat it. Mr. Spencer, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take you into custody. - Come on, what for? - Article 3104 of the Texas Penal Code. Registering at a public inn for the purpose of conducting lewd and lascivious acts. - Ah, yes. I thought I smelled a frame. - I did it just the way you wanted me too. - You were perfect, Jessie. - I don't suppose there's some kind of deal we could make? - You know there's a deal we can make. - Okay, you win. I'll kill the story. - And you keep that man away from Jessie. - Yeah, I'll hire two guys to break his legs if he even looks at her, okay? - Billy, what do you think? - I guess the best way to handle it is to just go ahead and file the charges, that way if it turns out he's not a man of his word, we can always get extradition papers, and go up to New York City after him. - I got it, I got it. - Come on you, outside. [atmospheric music plays] - It's okay, go ahead. - You know something, Laura? I'm really sorry it didn't work out. - I'll bet you are. - I don't mean the story, there are other stories. I'm talking about us. - Oh, that's just it, Spence. There is no us. I used to think there was. Even after we split up, I, I used to hope that someday maybe it'd work out. You know you're pretty heady stuff when you turn on that charm. I guess coming down here I, I learned a lot about myself. You just don't get to me anymore. - Remember I told ya, someday you're gonna have to convince me that you really mean that. - Believe it Spence. It's true. - Hello. - Morning. - Hi. - I'm here. - Okay. - Hi, Jessie Mathews. - Thanks, Jessie. - Hi. - Alrighty, Betty. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - I know it's first game of the new season, so I thought I'd just stop by and wish you good luck. - Oh, Kyle. I've been doing nothing but thinking about you these last couple days. Even though I'm terrified about not being a part of all this someday, I'm just not gonna let it ruin things for me, or for us. [lips smack] - See you later? - See you later. - Hi, I thought I outta bring this back. And I ah, I just wanted to say goodbye before I head back east. It's been an experience all right. - Hi, Miss Mitchell, Kim Everly. - Hi Kim, okay, on your way. - We had to get a replacement for you for the season. Laura, I've been thinking. You've been through all the auditions, and the rehearsals, and a few extra traumas we didn't count on. So I think it's just fair that you go on with the rest of the girls in Texas Stadium just to see what it feels like. - Really? - You know the routine. - Sure, go on. - Hey, that's great. - Alrighty, here we go.
