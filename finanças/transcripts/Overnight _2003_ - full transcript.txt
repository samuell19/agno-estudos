EVER SINCE I WAS A KID, I KNEW THAT I WAS NOT MEANT TO DO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO. I HOPE TO CONQUER THE WORLD. NOW A CLASSIC STORY OF THE HOLLYWOOD DREAM COMING TRUE: FROM BARTENDER TO MOVIE MAKER OVERNIGHT WITH A BAR THROWN IN AS A BONUS. PATRICK HEALY IS LIVE IN WEST HOLLYWOOD WITH DETAILS. JESS, WE’VE ALL HEARD THE LEGEND OF ACTRESS LANA TURNER BEING DISCOVERED IN A SODA FOUNTAIN, SO WHAT’S WRONG WITH A SALOON BEING REMEMBERED AS THE LAUNCHING PAD FOR HOLLYWOOD’S NEWEST WONDERKID? IF YOU DON’T RECOGNIZE THE UNSHAVEN GUY IN THE SHADES OR IF YOU’VE NEVER HEARD THE NAME TROY DUFFY, DON’T FEEL LEFT OUT. BUT THAT’S CHANGING REAL FAST. ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER IS FILM LAND’S NEWEST FIND. ONLY THIS CINDERELLA IS A TOUGH GUY BARTENDER AND BOUNCER FROM BOSTON WHOSE VERY FIRST SCRIPT JUST GOT HIM A NEAR MILLION DOLLAR DEAL WITH MIRAMAX FILMS, THE OUTFIT THAT JUST CLEANED UP ON OSCAR NIGHT. I NEVER THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN SO QUICKLY. Patrick: HIS SCRIPT THE BOONDOCK SAINTS IS ABOUT A COUPLE OF BOSTON BROTHERS WHO TAKE IT ON THEMSELVES TO ELIMINATE EVIL. PULP FICTION WITH SOUL IS THE BEST ANALOGY ONE OF THE PRODUCERS COULD COME UP WITH. DUFFY WROTE THE SCRIPT DURING BREAKS FROM TENDING BAR HERE AT J. SLOAN’S, A MELROSE SALOON NO ONE WOULD EVER CONFUSE WITH MORTON’S OR THE OTHER PLACES THE HOLLYWOOD HIGH-ROLLERS USUALLY HANG OUT AT. BUT MIRAMAX PRESIDENT HARVEY WEINSTEIN CAME HERE TO MAKE THE DEAL WITH DUFFY. I FELT FROM THAT, FROM THAT OFFER, THAT, UH, HE WAS MORE PASSIONATE. NOT ONLY THAT, HE AGREED TO BUY DUFFY THE BAR, AND DUFFY BOUGHT THE DEAL. SO, DUFFY AND HIS ENTOURAGE HAVE TO GO BACK TO BOSTON NEXT WEEK TO SCOUT LOCATIONS, BUT FOR NOW... WELL, THEY’RE HANGING OUT AT J. SLOAN’S. REPORTING LIVE FROM WEST HOLLYWOOD, PATRICK HEALY, CHANNEL 4 NEWS. LET THE CORRUPTION BEGIN. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN OVERNIGHT, BOOM. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU SHOULD CALL THIS PLACE FUCKIN’ DUFFY'S. J. SLOAN’S BECOMES HIP AND SLICK, AND THERE’S MOVIE PEOPLE RUNNING ALL OVER THE PLACE. Troy: AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE I WOULD JUST DIE TO HAVE MY PARENTS CALL ME UP AND SAY, "SON, I’M PROUD OF YOU." I WANT MY MOM TO GRAB THAT FUCKING MAGAZINE ARTICLE AND SHOW HER FRIENDS, SAY, "THAT’S MY FUCKING SON RIGHT THERE." SHUT UP! Man: NO. Second man: YEAH, BABY! YEAH! WHOO-HOO! I’D BE PROUD TO HAVE MY FRIENDS GO, "THAT--THAT GUY RIGHT THERE, HE’S A FRIEND OF MINE." HAVE EVERYBODY KNOW WHO I AM. SOMETIMES I LOOK AT THE PRESS CLIPPINGS AND I CAN’T BELIEVE HOW WELL HE HAS HANDLED IT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND HE’S ON THE COVER OF USA TODAY? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WE’RE ALL SET AND DONE. ALL THAT’S GONNA MATTER IS THAT THERE’S THIS PLACE THAT YOU AND I ARE GETTING REALLY OLD. ALL THE GUYS IN THE BAND ARE READY TO FALL OVER. THEY SAID, "FUCK THIS. WE’LL HANG HERE, HAVE THE BEST TIME." BOTH YOU AND I, WE WANT TO DO IT FOR THE RIGHT PRICE. WE WOULD CHEAT OURSELVES TO SAY, "LOOK IT..." Troy: FRIENDSHIP’S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD TO ME. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. 7 MEN WHO WERE ALWAYS THERE AT THE BEGINNING BEFORE ANYTHING HAPPENED. THAT IS THEIR LEGITIMACY. I QUIT MY JOB. IT’S HAPPENING, BABY. THIS JUST HAPPENED TO FALL INTO PLACE... VIA THE BAR, WHERE THERE WERE PIECES OF PIE THAT SEEMED LIKE THEY FIT TOGETHER. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] YOU GOT HIM WEAK AT HIS KNEES. HOW’D YOU DO THAT, JIM? I LOVE THIS GUY. Troy: THIS GROUP, I BELIEVE, HAS MORE POTENTIAL TO PUT MORE CREATIVITY ON THE TABLE THAN PROBABLY ANY 7 MEN IN THE HISTORY OF THIS WHOLE FUCKING TOWN. THE WAY WE’RE GONNA GET THAT IS BY HAVING EVERYBODY BIND TOGETHER. WE’LL DESERVE EVERY FUCKING CENT WE GET. WE’LL DESERVE EVERY OUNCE OF RECOGNITION WE GET. TROY’S THE KIND OF GUY THAT CAN GO INTO A ROOM FULL OF FUCKING HIGH-POWERED EXECUTIVES AND HE, AHEM, BRINGS THEM DOWN TO HIS LEVEL OR UP TO HIS LEVEL, HOWEVER YOU PERCEIVE IT. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] SHOOT. GUYS LIKE ME-- I MEAN, IF YOU HAD MET-- WHEN YOU FIRST MET ME, YOU THOUGHT I WAS A HOODLUM. THOSE WERE YOUR EXACT WORDS. WHEN WE START TO SEE THE THING SUCCEED, THAT’S A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALL GAME. ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY’RE GOING, "THIS MORON I SAW DRUNK AT THE BAR, "I SAW HIM PUKING IN ALLEYS, THIS IS WHAT HE’S DOING?" WHAT PEOPLE I DON’T THINK REALIZE IS THAT SUCCESS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE AND HOW YOU TREAT YOUR FRIENDS, REALLY. YOU GOT THE GOODS, YOU GOT THE GOODS. NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF A FUCK-UP YOU ARE. TROY, YOUR SCRIPT IS SO UNBELIEVABLE. YOU’RE THE FUCKING BEST ACTOR I’VE EVER SEEN, MAN. IT’S AMAZING, MAN, I TELL YOU. I DON’T KNOW IF YOU SHOULD FILM ME BLOWING HIM, BUT, UH, YOU KNOW... YEAH, WE TALKED A LOT. I JUST--I BASICALLY WAS INTERESTED IN, YOU KNOW, WHERE HE CAME UP WITH THESE IDEAS, YOU KNOW, HOW HE WAS JUST UP-AND-COMING AND STILL FELT STRONGLY ABOUT GOING OUT, FIRST AND FOREMOST, MAKING A GOOD MOVIE. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT INTRIGUES ME. I THINK EVEN A LOT OF THE OLDER AND MUCH MORE ESTABLISHED AND EVEN ACCLAIMED DIRECTORS ARE LOSING THEIR EDGE, YOU KNOW. I THINK IT TAKES SOMEBODY YOUNG AND IN TOUCH WITH THE SHIT TO REALLY BE ABLE TO TELL THE STORY. YOU KNOW? AND HE’S OBVIOUSLY ON THE RIGHT PAGE, SO... TROY MUST BE MOVING OUT OF HERE SOON. GUY’S GOT MORE MONEY THAN I DO RIGHT NOW. I CAN’T BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA BE ON THE COVER OF A MAGAZINE, AND I GOT TO SHARE IT WITH 2 GUYS I DON’T EVEN REALLY LIKE. [ALL LAUGHING] Duffy: YEAH, NOW YOU GOT IT. THAT’S THE ONE RIGHT THERE. THAT’S WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT--SINGLES. I DON’T NEED ANYBODY MESSING UP MY GIG. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [SHUTTER CLICKING] [CLICK] [CLICK] HOLD ON, LET ME TRY ONE OF THESE. NO? IT’S NOT WORKING FOR YOU? YEAH, THAT’S WORKING. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] THEY SAID IF WE’RE MEETING PARENTS AND SHIT IT’S BEYOND THE SECURITY THING. ALL RIGHT? I THINK DEFINITELY MY BROTHER’S A ROLE MODEL TO ALL THE TALENTED PEOPLE OUT THERE. AS FAMOUS AS HE MIGHT GET, I DON’T THINK FOR ONE SECOND THAT HE’LL EVER LOSE TOUCH. I FEEL THE BOND BETWEEN HIM AND MY BROTHERS AND MY DAD AND MY MOM. Troy: WHEN DID YOU SWITCH FROM YOUR JIM MORRISON LOOK TO THIS BRAD PITT THING YOU GOT GOING ON? IT’S WEIRD TO SAY BECAUSE HE’S MY BROTHER. HE’S JUST GONNA BE SO SUPER BIG... BECAUSE HIS MIND IS JUST SO SUPER BIG. AND HE DESERVES EVERYTHING THAT’S COMING TO HIM. [NO AUDIO] I’M A LITTLE AFRAID, LIKE A LITTLE BIT, THAT IT MIGHT GET OUT OF HAND OR HE MIGHT STOP CALLING US OR HE MIGHT GET INTO THINGS HE SHOULDN’T BE GETTING INTO. ’CAUSE HOLLYWOOD'S JUST LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW? YOU CAN’T REALLY ESCAPE IT. I’VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT IT. DAD, HOW ARE YOU? HI. IF YOU WANT SOME BREAKFAST, GO AHEAD SIT DOWN, HAVE SOMETHING. PFFT. EH. TAKE A SEAT. THE BAND IS ALREADY A FUCKING SUCCESS. BILLBOARD MAGAZINE CALLED UP. THEY WANT TO DO... AN INTERVIEW ON THE BAND. OUR AGENTS HAVE TO TURN AWAY RECORD COMPANIES RIGHT NOW, SAYING WE CAN’T ACCEPT ANY OFFERS. ALL THESE PEOPLE WANT TO BE INVOLVED WITH ME, WANT TO... WANT TO HAVE LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH ME, IN MUSIC AND FILM. SO I’M VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT. SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT GOING ON HERE. THAT’S FOR SURE. I FELT THAT THING START-- NAME/FACE RECOGNITION AND ALL THAT. OVER THE YEAR, THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE GONNA KNOW ABOUT WHAT’S GOING ON. I CAN’T WAIT. PEOPLE THINK WE’RE FUCK-UPS. EVERYBODY THINKS WE’RE FUCK-UPS, EXCEPT THE RIGHT PEOPLE. THE RIGHT PEOPLE SEE EVERYTHING, BECAUSE THEY SEE THE TALENT THERE. THEY SEE THE MATERIAL. THEY SEE THE WAY WE ARE, SEE HOW UNINTIMIDATED WE ARE BY EVERYONE. YOU KNOW? YOU’VE BEEN THERE SOMETIMES WITH ME IN MEETINGS WITH SOME OF THE BIGGEST GUYS IN THIS TOWN, TONY. I SIT DOWN THERE. I GOT DRUNK THE NIGHT BEFORE. I’M HUNG OVER AS HELL. I’M WEARING MY OVERALLS. THESE GUYS ARE ALL IN SUITS. I LOOK LIKE A MESS. I’M SMOKING. CAN I HAVE A CIGARETTE? I CAN’T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I HEARD, "OH, I’VE HAD THIS HAPPEN TO MY FRIENDS. "IT ALWAYS FALLS THROUGH. BE PREPARED TO GET YOUR ASS KICKED." AND I STILL GET WHAT I NEED DONE. YOUR FRIENDS DESCEND UPON YOU LIKE A BUNCH OF FUCKING VULTURES. QUESTIONS: "WHAT’S GOING ON WITH THIS?" DA DA DA. YOU TELL ’EM, THEY GO, "PFFT, NEVER WORK OUT. NEVER." FUCK YOU. "I HEAR YOU DID A CHANNEL 4 INTERVIEW IN THE BAR TODAY, GONNA BE ON THE NEWS." YEAH, IT’S GONNA BE ON IN 5 MINUTES. HERE WE GO. BAM, THEY SEE ME. "IT’S GONNA FALL THROUGH." WHAT DO I GOT TO DO TO YOU FUCKING PEOPLE? IF OUR MUSIC IN THIS FILM IS EMBRACED, WE WILL HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING THAT NO ONE ELSE IN THE HISTORY OF THIS FUCKING WORLD HAS EVER DONE. BE ACCEPTED ON A HUGE SCALE IN BOTH MEDIUMS OF FILM AND MUSIC. IF WE ACCOMPLISH THAT... [INDISTINCT CHATTER] DID YOU SEE DEAD MAN WALKING? YEAH, I SAW DEAD MAN WALKING. AT THE END OF IT, I SAID, GOOD THING THEY KILLED THAT COCKSUCKER. WHAT DID YOU THINK? "OH, HE’S GOT A HEART AND A SOUL?" WELL, NO. WELL, YES. YES. I JUST GET VERY CONFLICTED. I GET EXTREMELY CONFLICTED. EVERYBODY DOES, MA. UNTIL YOU MAKE A HARD-NOSED DECISION, SAY I’M GOING EITHER THIS WAY OR THAT WAY, YOU’RE GONNA BE CONFLICTED. EVERYBODY’S THAT WAY. EVERYBODY’S WISHY-WASHY. IT’S SUCH A SENSITIVE ISSUE. TO ME, IT’S THE MOST SENSITIVE. SHOULD WE KILL EVIL PEOPLE? I MEAN, YOU CAN’T ASK A QUESTION THAT IS MORE SENSITIVE THAN THAT. [ALL LAUGHING] I’M SORRY. THE THING THAT PISSES TAYLOR OFF THE MOST HIS ENTIRE LIFE IS THE FACT THAT I’M HIS OLDER BROTHER. THERE’S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT THAT. HE’LL GET UP, SAY, "FUCK YOU, FUCK THE BAND, I’M OUT OF HERE." WELL, HE’D CERTAINLY BE CUTTING OFF HIS OWN NOSE TO SPITE HIS FACE, WOULDN’T HE? I DON’T SEE HIM DOING THAT. I DO. I SEE HIM DOING THAT IF YOU SPEAK TO HIM IN THE MANNER THAT YOU’RE SPEAKING TO ME RIGHT THIS MINUTE. I THINK HE’D BE MORE CONTENT BEING A FUCKING BARTENDER THE REST OF HIS FUCKING LIFE RATHER THAN ADMIT EVEN ONCE THAT I’M RIGHT AND HE’S WRONG. THAT IS THE REASON I DIVORCED YOUR FATHER. HE HAD TO BE UP, I HAD TO BE DOWN. THIS TIME I AM 100% RIGHT AND HE IS 100% WRONG, SO THERE IS A GUY WHO’S RIGHT, AND THERE IS A GUY WHO’S WRONG. YOU’VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY TO APPROACH IT. NOBODY’S GONNA TELL ME THAT AND HAVE ME BELIEVE IT. I HAVE CREATED ALL THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS BAND. I HAVE SWEAT AND BLED AND--AND DIED FOR THIS. I’M SAYING THE WHOLE PREMISE IS JUST...SKEWED. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [LAUGHING] WHOO! WOO-HOO! YES! IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN DO FOR YOU? MOM, YOU’RE LATE. IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN... [LAUGHING] SHIT, THIS AIN’T EVEN THE MAIN THING. THIS AIN’T EVEN THE BAND. THIS IS LIKE A SIDELINE TO HOLD ON. IT’S A HOBBY. IT’S A GODDAMN HOBBY. Mom: YEAH. NIFTY. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] OH, YEAH. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WHOO! TROY COMES THROUGH, WHUPS MY ASS. I WENT HOME WITH THAT UGLY GIRL THAT HE-- THAT WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM LAST NIGHT. WHAT UGLY GIRL? THE UGLY GIRL. THE UGLY ONE THAT ALWAYS IS AFTER YOU. WHICH ONE’S THAT? YEAH. YOU WENT HOME WITH AN UGLY CHICK LAST NIGHT? YEAH, BUT I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING WITH HER. YEAH, RIGHT! YOU’RE LYING! I SWEAR TO GOD. I SWEAR TO GOD. THAT’S KIND OF A PERSONAL QUESTION. OH, SHUT UP. YOU TELL US ABOUT GOING HOME, TAKING THIS GIRL THAT YOU THOUGHT MIGHT’VE BEEN A MAN HOME TO HER PLACE, GETTING IN BED WITH HER, AND THEN YOU SAY, OK, WELL, NOW WE’RE GETTING PERSONAL? [LAUGHING] PEOPLE THAT COME HERE LOVE THE PLACE. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] IT’S THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF MEETING AT SPAGO. PEOPLE THINK THAT THAT’S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. THAT YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO HANG OUT AT THOSE PLACES AND HAVE LUNCHES AND HAVE MEETINGS AT THOSE PLACES. AS YOU CAN SEE, HE’S DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS EVERY NIGHT HERE. I LIKE IT, TOO, BECAUSE THEN THE REST OF US CAN DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE PEOPLE WHO COME HERE TO TALK, YOU KNOW. ABOUT TO ENTER INTO A VERY IMPORTANT TIME OF OUR LIVES. GOING TO MEET WITH, UH, EWAN McGREGOR. I’M GONNA FUCKING GET DRUNK WITH EWAN’S ASS. I CAN TELL IT’S GONNA BE ONE OF THOSE, "COME HERE. COME TO PAPA." HA HA HA HA HA! AND HE WANTED TO BASICALLY LICK EACH OF MY TESTICLES INDIVIDUALLY ON A DAILY BASIS TO DO THIS FILM. I HATE KEANU REEVES. I THINK HE’S A FUCKING PUNK. I WILL NEVER DO A MOVIE WITH HIM. I THINK ETHAN HAWKE IS A TALENTLESS FOOL. I LOVE BRANAGH. I DON’T KNOW HOW LONG I’M WILLING TO WAIT FOR BRANAGH. OH, MR. BRANAGH, THIS IS MR. DUFFY IN LOS ANGELES GIVING YOU A CALL. I JUST CALLED TO-- SHIT, I HATE MESSAGE MACHINES. BYE-BYE. CUNT. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WHO IS THIS IDIOT? Tony: JERRY BRUCKHEIMER. JERRY BRUCKHEIMER. CON-FUCKING-AIR. ALL THESE GUYS THAT ARE ASSISTANTS WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY TRYING TO SCRAPE THEIR WAY TO THE TOP. I WENT FROM A BARTENDER, SURPASSED EVERYONE, AND GOT TO THE TOP. COMING IN WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF STRENGTH. I THINK IT’LL BE GOOD. WE CAN HAVE A CAREER THAT SPANS 2 DECADES IF ALL WE DO IS CONCENTRATE ON WHAT’S AT HAND AT THE TIME. IF WE’RE FUCKING MAKING MOVIES-- WHETHER IT’S YOURS, YOURS OR THE TWO OF YOU-- AND WE’RE STILL WRITING MUSIC AT OUR OWN FUCKING PACE, OUR OWN SPEED, EVERY ALBUM WILL BE JUST AS GOOD AS THE LAST. AND WE CAN PICK OUR MOMENTS, SEE? I’M ALSO TALKING ABOUT HAVING DINNER WITH PEOPLE’S FAMILIES AND SHIT EVENTUALLY, DOING SHOWS FOR ARMY BASES FREE OF CHARGE JUST TO SHOW THAT WE RESPECT THEM AND LOVE WHAT THEY DO. AND WE CAN’T BE ACTING LIKE FOOLS. AAH! AAH! ARRRR! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] FUCKING GO, NIRVANA BOY. HEY! HEY! [LAUGHING] I’VE ALWAYS... DRANK A LOT. WHEN I WAS-- I STARTED WAY BACK IN JUNIOR HIGH, ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL, DRINKING SHITLOADS. IT IS NOT A CELLO. IT IS NOT A VIOLIN. IT IS A VIOLA. A VIOLA-LIN. HA HA HA HA HA! [HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER] YOU’VE BEEN DRINKING EVERY NIGHT. OPEN UP YOUR THROAT. DON’T BUMP IT. BUMP IT AWAY. ALL THE WAY. ALL THE WAY. TO THE CORNER, TO THE LEFT. TO THE LEFT. [GLASS BREAKS] [LAUGHTER] IN THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IS IF I’M A FUCKING RECORD COMPANY, I’M DEALING WITH GUYS THAT LIVE OUT OF FUCKING GARAGES AND TRY TO BANG STRIPPERS TO GET FUCKING CHEESE SANDWICHES. WE’RE COMING TO 'EM WITH A FUCKING... LOG PILE OF CREATIVITY, SAYING WE CAN HANDLE IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY EVER HAS, THAT WE’RE BETTER THAN EVERYBODY. WE HAVE A DEEP CESSPOOL OF CREATIVITY HERE. IF I’M A RECORD COMPANY EXECUTIVE, I’M BUYING. WE DON’T HAVE A DEMO RIGHT NOW, AND WE NEED TO FINISH THE FUCKING DEMO. IT’S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU GUYS. I WILL DO THE WORK TO GET YOU IN THE STUDIO, BUT I NEED YOU TO BE THERE ANYTIME I NEED YOU. YEP. I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE VOCALS. SORT OF IF THE BEATLES COULD MEET ALICE IN CHAINS, YOU KNOW, AND SOMEHOW COME UP WITH A VOCAL STYLE THAT WAS THAT LUSH BUT STILL HAD THE POWER. I WAS REALLY, REALLY IMPRESSED. SO I THINK THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BAND THAT WOULD ENHANCE THE MUSIC BUSINESS. ACTUALLY, THAT’S KIND OF INTERESTING. LIKE REALLY QUICK LIKE THAT OR LEAVE OUT THAT LAST CHORD? NO, I’D PLAY THAT. 1, 2, BA DA DA, BA DA DA. THEY STILL HAVE TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CRAFT. DREAMWORKS IS THE ONE I WANT THE MOST, BECAUSE OF THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH FILM. NOW IT’S TIME TO START UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE ALL WANT TO DO. [ELECTRIC GUITAR PLAYING] TO ME, HE’S JUST TROY, MY BROTHER. BUT NOW ALL THIS SHIT’S HAPPENING. IT’S PRETTY FUCKING CRAZY. BUT, UH... IT’S BEEN VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. I GOT A LOT OF SHIT RUNNING AROUND IN MY MIND, YOU KNOW? THINGS, HOPES THAT I HAVE FOR THE BAND AND THE WAY I WANT THINGS TO GO. A LOT OF WORRIES THAT I HAVE ABOUT PEOPLE. TROY DIDN’T COME OUT HERE TO WRITE THE SCREENPLAY. HE CAME OUT HERE FOR MUSIC. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, IT IS THE CORE OF WHAT PUT US HERE. THE MUSIC HAS NOT PUT US HERE, THE MOVIE DID. MADONNA IS DEFINITELY THERE, RIGHT? SHE’S THERE, YEAH. FREDDY DeMANN, AGAIN, HE’S THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY. HE AND MADONNA ARE CO-EXECUTIVES. HE IS HER MANAGER. HE IS ALSO THE CO-MANAGER OF MICHAEL JACKSON. MAVERICK WAS FORMED ACTUALLY AS PART OF A RENEGOTIATION OF MADONNA’S DEAL. BUT NO, HE’S GOT EVERYTHING FIGURED OUT. OK, FINE. FINE. FINE. Tony: I MEAN, ARE WE WRONG? ARE WE WRONG? SEE, THAT’S THE FACE. YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS? HE WANTS THIS COMPANY. HE WANTS THIS BROTHERHOOD. HE WANTS US ALL TO BE WORKING FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES TOGETHER. YET HE WILL NOT THROW OUT THAT LITTLE BIT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW TO MAKE IT ALL HAPPEN FOR US. HE HAS THIS THING ABOUT WORK HARD NOW, GET PAID LATER. GREAT. BUT I’M RUNNING OUT OF WAYS TO WORK HARD NOW... BECAUSE I--I--I DON’T HAVE A TELEPHONE AND I’M GETTING KICKED OUT OF MY APARTMENT. I’M FINDING IT HARD TO WORK HARD NOW AND GET PAID LATER. ’CAUSE IF WE'RE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY FOR DREAMWORKS, THEY’RE GONNA SEE ME BRINGING IN PROJECTS WITH TONY AND MARK, AND THEY’RE GONNA WANT THAT. AND THEY’RE GONNA GET HIT IN THE ASS BY THE WHOLE REST OF THE INDUSTRY. IF WE’RE MAKING MONEY FOR DREAMWORKS AS A BAND, MIRAMAX IS GONNA TREAT ME WITH VERY GENTLE HANDS AND DO WHATEVER THE FUCK I WANT. OUR DILEMMA IS THIS... NEXT TIME WE PLAY LIVE, WE MAY, UH...WELL... OH, MY GOD. CONGRATULATIONS. DO YOU HAVE ANY FUCKING-- ANY IDEA WHAT’S GOING ON? I NEED ONE OF THOSE. YEAH, BABY! YEAH! YOU FUCKING TAKE IT. TURN AROUND, BITCH. FIRST FUCKING TIME IN HOLLYWOOD HISTORY THEY’RE SIGNING A BAND SIGHT UNSEEN. IF THIS MAN DIDN’T HAVE A BIG-ASS HERPE ON HIS LIP, I’D KISS HIM RIGHT ON THE MOUTH. I’M LIKE, I'M GOING, "YOU’RE FUCKING KIDDING ME. YOU’RE SHITTING ME RIGHT NOW." YOU DIDN’T EVEN KNOW WHO WAS CALLING. NO, I HAD NO FUCKING IDEA. I’D SAY WE'RE BATTING ABOUT A THOUSAND, BOYS. I THINK YOU’RE PRETTY MUCH READY FOR THE HALL OF FAME. THEN I GOT A FUCKING CALL 5 MINUTES LATER THAT KENNETH BRANAGH PASSED. I WAS LIKE, "WHAT-THE-FUCK-EVER." BOOM. SO I SAY WE GO IN THERE AND DRINK A HEFTY AMOUNT. I AM THERE. I’M FUCKING THERE, MAN. THAT’S FUCKING SHIT, DUDE. Man: CUT, PRINT! NEW RECORDING ARTISTS... WHEN SHOULD I START GETTING ANGRY HERE? THIS IS TAKING TOO FUCKING LONG. EVERYBODY KNOWS IT’S THE BEST FUCKING PROJECT IN HOLLYWOOD. EVERY FUCKING ACTOR THAT READS IT GOES, "OH, MY CHRIST." Producer: I KNOW, BUT WE HAVE 2 BIG DEMERITS WORKING AGAINST US. ONE IS, WE DON’T-- WE’RE NOT PAYING MONEY. WE GOT THE BEST SCRIPT IN TOWN, BUT WE’RE NOT PAYING ANY DOUGH. AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS, YOU’RE A FIRST-TIME DIRECTOR. THEY GOT TO GET WITH YOU. THEY GOT TO GET IN A ROOM WITH YOU AND YOU GUYS GOT TO CONNECT. WE SHOULD ALSO START SPREADING THE RUMOR THAT I’M VERY FUCKING UPSET WITH WILLIAM MORRIS AND CONSIDERING LEAVING. I GOT MY CONTRACT LIMITED TO A YEAR. WHAT HAVE WE GOT LEFT ON THAT NOW? WE’VE GOT 6 MONTHS LEFT. YOU TELL ’EM I'M AT C.A.A. IN 6 MONTHS, THEN THEY’LL START MOVING ON THIS SHIT. OK. MY SUGGESTION TO YOU IS THAT IT’S OK FOR YOU TO SAY YOU’RE UPSET, BUT IT’S NOT OK FOR YOU TO SAY YOU’RE CONSIDERING LEAVING. ALL RIGHT, THEN SAY I’M UPSET. THAT’S FINE. THE OTHER THING THAT I’D LIKE TO DO, TROY, IS I’D LIKE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU, ME, AND MERYL POSTER. MM-HMM. DO THE SHIT RIGHT NOW. CAN YOU GET HER ON THE PHONE? YEAH. LET ME SEE. CAN YOU TRY AND GET MERYL POSTER ON THIS CONFERENCE CALL? YOU CALL HER ON THE OTHER LINE, TELL HER I’M ON THE LINE WITH TROY. WE’D LIKE TO CONFERENCE HER INTO THIS CALL. WHAT DID SHE SAY? WAS SHE THERE? AND YOU TOLD HER THAT I WAS ON WITH TROY? SHE DIDN’T TAKE THE CALL. WELL, THIS IS FUCKING GREAT. DOES HARVEY JUST DO THIS TO FIRST-TIME FILMMAKERS? IT’S ALL I KEEP HEARING FROM EVERY-FUCKING-BODY. IT’S WHAT HE LOVES TO DO. GRAB THE TALENTED PEOPLE, THEN HE--PFFT!-- IGNORES THEM. WHOOP! HARVEY... HEY. YOU KNOW, THESE GUYS ARE COMING DOWN-- LIKE GOLDBLUM AND STUFF LIKE THAT-- TO THIS SCRIPT BECAUSE OF THE MATERIAL. I THINK THAT IF, YOU KNOW, IF DE NIRO WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ IT, MAYBE YOU NEVER QUITE KNOW WHAT HIS REACTION WOULD BE. I DON’T THINK I CAN DO IT, I KNOW I CAN DO IT. I JUST NEED YOU TO-- NEED YOU TO HELP ME OUT, MAN. I JUST NEED SOME-- I NEED SOME THINGS HERE. LISTEN, WE’LL PROBABLY MAKE A BUNCH OF FILMS TOGETHER. I KNOW, I JUST NEED SOME HELP ON THESE THINGS. LOOK, I’M NOT GONNA FUCK WITH YOU, HARVEY, I NEVER REALLY INTENDED ON BEING A DIRECTOR. I’VE NEVER GONE TO FILM SCHOOL. I DON’T HAVE ALL THE CREDITS ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WORLD DO THAT WANT TO DO THIS TYPE OF THING. I FELL INTO THIS THING, AND I FELT IT, OK? I’M JUST A FUCKING POOR KID FROM BOSTON, NEVER HAD A FUCKING THING IN MY WHOLE LIFE, AND YOU WERE THE FIRST MAN TO COME UP AND TAKE A VESTED INTEREST IN ME AND SAY THIS KID’S COMING WITH ME. AND YOU’RE A MENTOR OF MINE, AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. AND I JUST WANTED TO GET THAT OFF MY CHEST, TO KNOW THAT I HAD SAID THAT TO YOU. ENOUGH SAID. SEE YOU. Producer: IF HARVEY DOESN’T GET INTO IT, YOU KNOW, WE CAN-- WE CAN FUCKING FORGET ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. FIRST OF ALL, I’M HOLLYWOOD'S NEW HARD-ON. WHY AREN’T THEY FUCKING GIVING THAT ANY CREDENCE? SECOND OF ALL, ARE WE THREATENING AS MUCH AS WE CAN HERE? NO, WE’RE NOT. THAT'S WHY HARVEY NEEDS TO CALL. EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME. YOU’RE DEAD WRONG. THREATEN, AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS YOU’LL GET NOBODY. THAT WAS TROY SPEAKING. I HEARD YOU AGREE WITH HIM. NO, I DIDN’T. HE’S LOOKING TO YOU FOR CONFIRMATION. I JUST SAID THAT HARVEY IS NOT CALLING. HARVEY IS THE ONLY-- THAT’S ALL I SAID. WHAT THE FUCK IS HARVEY DOING? I MEAN, WHAT IS HE REALLY DOING? WHO IS HE FIGHTING FOR? WHO IS HE TALKING TO IN THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW? IF I’M THE FUCKING PRIORITY PROJECT OVER AT MIRAMAX... AND HE’S IGNORING ME, WHAT THE FUCK IS HE DOING? BUT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, THIS SHIP IS DRIFTING AWAY. I DON’T THINK IT'S MOVING AWAY FROM THE SHORE. I THINK THEY’RE PLAYING HARD HARDBALL. MAYBE THEY REALLY DECIDED THEY WANTED US TO STILL GO. Man: HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT, TROY? Troy: I DON’T KNOW. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM ANYONE AT MIRAMAX. I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM MY AGENT SAYING THAT HARVEY WAS PULLING OUT AND DIDN’T WANT TO MAKE THE MOVIE. SO I DON’T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED, BUT I’M PRETTY SURE IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOUNG MERYL POSTER, WHO IS NOT MY BIGGEST FAN. THAT FUCKING CUNT FROM MIRAMAX DOESN’T LIKE ME. AS A MATTER OF FACT, SHE DOESN’T LIKE ME AT ALL. SHE CONSIDERS ME A BOOZING, WOMANIZING ASSHOLE THAT NEVER DESERVED THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE. [SIGHS] IT’S ALL JUST TALK, YOU KNOW. EVEN HARVEY WITH ALL HIS FUCKING MONEY AND BUYING THE BAR AND FUCKING THE PRESS BONANZA THAT FOLLOWED. IT WAS ALL JUST TALK. THAT’S IT. NOTHING WAS EVER GETTING DONE. THERE WAS SOME PART OF ME THAT SAID THIS IS ALL WRONG, YOU KNOW? ALL THE FOCUS WAS BEING PLACED IN THE WRONG PLACE. MY STORY, MIRAMAX BUYING THE BAR, IT WENT STRAIGHT TO FUCKING URBAN LEGEND. THERE’S PEOPLE IN KANSAS AND COLORADO WITH MY FUCKING FACE ON THEIR REFRIGERATOR SAYING, "YEAH, YOU KNOW, A FUCKING-- SOME--SOME BLUE COLLAR GUY CAN STILL DO IT." BUT IT WAS ALL BULLSHIT. I DIDN’T WANT AN ADVERSE RELATIONSHIP WITH MY STUDIO TO BEGIN WITH, BUT THAT’S WHAT HARVEY CATERS. THAT’S ALL HE DOES. THE BAR’S NICE. IT’S ALL FUCKING NICE. I’M NOT GONNA FUCKING DENY IT, EVEN THOUGH I DON’T OWN IT ’CAUSE HARVEY DIDN'T FUCKING COME THROUGH AS USUAL. I DON’T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT MAKING ENEMIES WITHIN MIRAMAX. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I’M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT IN SOME WAYS. THEY JUST MADE THE MOTHER OF ALL MIRAMAX FUCK-UPS AND WHEN THEY COME BACK TO THE TABLE AND THEY WANT BACK IN, ONCE THIS THING’S FILMED, THEY’RE GONNA PAY THEIR WAY BACK IN. HARVEY’S GONNA PAY AND PAY AND PAY AND PAY. [TELEPHONE RINGS] HELLO. ERIC, HOW ARE YOU? BLOWN OUT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT HAPPENED? YOU TOLD THIS TO FREDDY? OK. ALL RIGHT. MM-HMM. OH, JEEZ. SHOULD I HAVE A MEETING WITH FREDDY DeMANN? ALL RIGHT. IF IT CAN’T BE SALVAGED, IT CAN’T BE SALVAGED, YOU KNOW? WE’LL FIGURE SOMETHING ELSE OUT. ALL RIGHT, SEE YA. BYE. THE GAME’S JUST CHANGED, AND NOW WE’RE IN AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE TO PRODUCE OR WE’RE DONE. FREDDY DeMANN’S GETTING COLD FEET AND WISHES TO BACK OUT OF THIS DEAL. I JUST WENT OVER THERE TO MAVERICK AND WAS NOT ALLOWED ENTRANCE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY’RE GONNA PAY DEARLY FOR SAYING NO TO US AT THE WRONG FUCKING TIME. BUT, RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE NO DEAL. I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT. [SIGHS] I’M NOT AFRAID OF THIS. MAVERICK RECORDS DOESN’T SCARE ME ON THIS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE ARE SCARING THEM SHITLESS RIGHT NOW. THEY’RE THE ONES HAVING LITTLE EMERGENCY MEETINGS AND NOT LETTING ME IN THE FRONT DOOR OF MAVERICK. THEY’RE THE ONES CALLING UP OUR LAWYERS FEVERISHLY TRYING TO SCHEDULE SOMETHING WITH ME. THEY’RE ON THE FUCKING RUN RIGHT NOW, NOT US, BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT WE’RE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL. AND THEY KNOW THAT ON THAT DAY THAT WE ARE SUCCESSFUL, THEY’RE GONNA SAY, "WELL, WE HEARD YOU HAD A FUCKING RECORD DEAL WITH MAVERICK RECORDS." WE’RE GONNA SAY, "YEAH, THEY BACKED OUT AND GOT COLD FEET AT THE LAST SECOND." AND THAT’S WHAT THESE MOTHERFUCKERS ARE MORE AFRAID OF THAN ANYTHING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. THE FOREMOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THIS EQUATION RIGHT NOW ARE ME AND THE REST OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BAND. EVERYBODY ELSE COMES SECOND. ANY OF THESE GUYS NEED ANYTHING, YOU GET IT FOR ’EM. YOU DON’T ASK THEM QUESTIONS, DON’T MATTER WHAT YOU'RE DOING, YOU GET IT FOR ’EM. AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH FUCKING SHUT. AS FAR AS I’M CONCERNED, FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION ANYMORE. ANYBODY FAILS, THEY’RE GONE. GONE. THEY’RE FIRED. THEY’RE OUT OF OUR LIVES. AND IT WILL BE YOUR FAULT AT THE END OF THE FUCKING DAY, BE YOUR FAULT THAT YOU FUCKED UP THIS BAD. WILL YOU KEEP US WHEN WE’RE WRONG THEN? NO. YOU’LL BE DOING A LOT OF THIS SHIT BY YOURSELF. NO, I WON’T. BECAUSE I DESERVE TO BE EXACTLY WHERE I AM HERE. REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I KEPT YOU INVOLVED AND YOU ALL OF A SUDDEN TURNED INTO DONALD TRUMP? TELLING ME, EVERYBODY ELSE, ABOUT HOW TO ARRANGE THIS RECORD DEAL? THAT’S NOT GONNA HAPPEN ANYMORE. NO MORE FUCK-UPS. I’LL KEEP YOU INFORMED. OK. BUT THE BIG BAND-AID OF SUCCESS AT THE END OF THE FUCKING DAY, AND THAT’S ALL THAT FUCKING MATTERS HERE. YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR MOUTHS SHUT AND DO YOUR FUCKING JOBS. YOU HAVE TO. [CLEARS THROAT] [HEAVY RAIN FALLING] [INSTRUMENTAL GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS] [CAMERA CLICKS] LOOK THAT WAY. [CAMERA CLICKS] [WOMAN SINGING OPERATIC] THEY’RE TAKING FUCKING SERIOUS ADVANTAGE BY EVEN CALLING YOU. THEY KNOW THE SITUATION, THOSE COCKSUCKERS. ELIE, IT’S TROY. LISTEN, I JUST GOT A PHONE CALL FROM TRACY WHAT’S HER NAME-- JACOBS. JOANNE COLONNA AND-- AND, UH-- ED GOLDSTONE, AND THEY ARE FUCKING PIPING MAD. SO WHAT--LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GONNA DO? WHAT KIND OF-- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING YOU’RE NOT GONNA STAND FOR? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? YOU’RE ACTING LIKE I’M FINANCING THIS FILM. THESE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE FOR ME HERE. CAN’T YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND THAT? HEY, ED, ED, WE DON’T EVEN HAVE A GODDAMN MOVIE YET, ALL RIGHT? WE DON’T HAVE A MOVIE. SWAYZE SAID HE PASSED. WE’RE ONLY LIKE-- NO, WHERE’D YOU SEE-- NOW WHERE’D YOU HEAR THAT? I’M NOT MEETING WITH SWAYZE TOMORROW. I HAVEN’T SPOKEN TO THAT GUY IN OVER A WEEK. WHO GOT A PLAY OR PAY OFFER? ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT’S NEWS TO ME ’CAUSE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF ELIE ALL DAY. I DON’T EVEN-- I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THAT. MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT KIND OF MONEY WE’RE DEALING WITH SINCE YOU SEEM TO KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK I DID? SAY, "HEY, LISTEN, I REALLY WANT JON BON JOVI." YOU THINK THAT WAS, LIKE, MY DOING OR SOMETHING? I DIDN’T EVEN KNOW THIS CAT WAS AN ACTOR FOR CHRIST’S SAKES. WELL, DID I COMMIT MYSELF TO JON BON JOVI DURING THAT CONVERSATION? NO! I SAID I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR FUCKING CLIENT! AND DON’T SIT THERE AND CALL ME A FUCKING LIAR WHEN YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT! I DID NOT UNDERSTAND-- I DID NOT REALIZE THAT ME MADE ANY KIND OF PAY OR FUCKING PLAY OFFER TO ANYBODY! I HAVE NOT SPOKEN WITH THE FUCKING MAN! DON’T CALLING ME A FUCKING LIAR, JOANNE! YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT! Troy: ACTION! [PANTING] WHAT THE FUCK’S WRONG WITH YOU? I KNOW YOU FUCKING KNOW, SO DON’T EVEN START! FUCK YOU, ASSHOLE! [MEN ARGUING] I COULD HAVE WHACKED THAT FUCKING KID! [ALL YELLING] I’M A FREAK! I’M A FUCKING FREAK! CUT! YES! THE DREAM COMES ALIVE. YES, YES. HOW DO YOU FEEL? WE’RE DOING REALLY GOOD. AYE, YOU LOOK GREAT. YOU LOOK SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOU DID BEFORE. I GOT THAT GLOW. NO, IT’S JUST, YOU KNOW, YOU WERE SO TIRED AND PISSED OFF BEFORE. TRICK OR TREAT! HOLY SHIT! THIS IS BILLY CONNOLLY WEARING A LOVELY 2-PIECE ENSEMBLE, ALL IN BASIC BLACK. Man: HE HAS LACE PANTIES ON. IT’S JUST SO GOOD TO BE HERE SINCE THE-- THAT PUB, THOSE EARLY DAYS IN SLOAN’S. YOU DON’T HAVE TO PROVE IT TO ANYBODY ANYMORE. YEAH, NOW THE-- NOW THE LINE OF ASS KISSERS IS GETTING LONGER EVERY DAY IT LOOKS LIKE, MAN. OH, DEAR. WELL, JUST REMEMBER THE EARLY STUFF. KEEP THE EARLY STUFF IN MIND. IT’S SO MUCH MORE. [GUNFIRE] TROY ALREADY HAS HIS MIND MADE UP, WHICH IS AMAZING FOR A FIRST TIME GUY. HE DOESN’T HAVE THAT INSECURITY THAT YOU’LL OFTEN SEE A FIRST-TIME DIRECTOR HAVE, EVEN WITH ME WHEN I WAS CHOOSING A CERTAIN OUTFIT. YOU KNOW, WE HAD A WHOLE BUNCH OF CHOICES AND, "WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS?" "THAT’S GOOD." "OH. SHOULD I WEAR DARK GLASSES?" "YES." "YOU KNOW, I COULD TAKE THEM OFF." "NO." "FINE." YOU ARE WATCHING THESE THREE EXIT OUT THE FRONT AND YOU ARE NOTING THE LOOKS OF ABSOLUTE HORROR ON THEIR FACES WHEN YOU’RE DOING IT. ’CAUSE YOU KNOW WITH THAT-- NOW I’M STARING AT 6 GUYS WITH GUNS DRAWN. IT WAS A FUCKING AMBUSH. HOW DOES IT FINISH? IT FINISHES WITH YOU STANDING, THIS AND THAT, I’M GONNA YELL, "CUT." YEAH, YEAH. THAT’S HOW IT FINISHES. TROY’S BEEN VERY OPEN DURING THIS PROCESS. TOO OPEN. TOO OPEN. TROY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. [LAUGHS] OH, FUCKING DAFOE. I DON’T LIKE HIM. IT’S THE TANTRUMS. THE TANTRUMS. THE LONG SILENCES. A GOOD CLIP ABOUT THE EARS SOON SETTLED HIM. I SAID, "I DON’T GIVE A FUCK HOW YOU ACT, I’M MUCH TALLER THAN YOU!" "TAKE THAT," I SAID. "ON YOUR WAY, YOU FUCKING RAPSCALLION!" LONG, UNKEMPT HAIR. "A GOOD SCRUB’S WHAT YOU NEED, SONNY," I SAID. "AND I’M THE VERY CHAP TO DO IT!" BIFF! BIFF! I COME BEARING GIFTS. OH, LOOK IT, WE’VE GOT A MORE EXPENSIVE CAMERA NOW THAT WE’RE SUCCESSFUL. YES OR NO? Troy: MIRAMAX SENT ME SOME KIND OF FUCKING GIFT. FUCK MIRAMAX. WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THEM? [CLINKING] [INSTRUMENTAL GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS] JASON FLOM HAS A HISTORY WITH ATLANTIC, SO THEY GAVE HIM HIS OWN IMPRINT LABEL WHICH IS LAVA, IT’S HIS DEAL. LIKES TO BREAK BANDS VIA THE RADIO WHICH IS GOOD. RADIO DOES HAVE UNBELIEVABLE POWER, AND YOU GUYS HAPPEN TO BE, PROBABLY I THINK, WHAT THAT FORMAT IS READY FOR. LIKE I SAID, IF IT HITS AND WE’RE RIGHT, IT CAN BE AS YOU WOULD SAY A RECKONING. IT’S SOMETHING THAT EITHER IS GONNA FILL ARENAS OR IT’S GONNA GO COMPLETELY OVER PEOPLE’S HEADS, BUT THAT’S A SHOT I’M WILLING TO TAKE. Troy: THE BAND HAS BEEN OFFERED A RECORD CONTRACT BY ATLANTIC RECORDS. DO NOT GO STRAIGHT TO THE NUDIE BARS. [ALL LAUGHING] YEAH, STOP AT A BAR FIRST. STOP AT A BAR FIRST. HA HA HA! BUT THEY DO HAVE A RECORD DEAL. LIKE, FOR REAL, THEY HAVE A RECORD DEAL FOR REAL NOW. BUT WE’RE NOT A PART OF THAT. WE’RE NOT. WE’RE NO LONGER CO-MANAGING THE BAND. SO TROY’S GONNA MANAGE HIS OWN BUSINESS AND THEN GET A PROFESSIONAL MANAGER? IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN? I DON’T KNOW. WHY AM I DOING BUSINESS WITH THIS MAN? TONY, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU’RE THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING. I’M JUST THINKING, THAT’S ALL. NOTHING TO SAY RIGHT NOW. TALK...OR DON’T. AND IF YOU DECIDE NOT TO, DON’T BITCH AT ME FOR THE REST OF THE FUCKING TIME WE’RE TOGETHER HERE, TONY. WHAT IS IT? IT’S NOT JUST ONE THING. IT’S A NUMBER OF THINGS. THEN GO. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO BORROW AGAINST WHATEVER OUR PORTION IS THAT YOU’VE DECIDED ON TO COMPENSATE, TO BORROW AGAINST THAT? WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT MONEY’S GONNA COME FROM? IS IT POSSIBLE FOR HE AND I TO BORROW-- IT’S NOT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO BORROW FROM ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM. IF THERE IS AN ALLOTMENT OF MONEY THAT WAS DECIDED UPON THAT MARK AND I WOULD GET FROM THAT RECORD DEAL, HOLD ON A SECOND, THEN I’M SAYING-- ALL I’M SAYING IS, CAN WE BORROW AGAINST THAT? THERE’S NO MONEY TO BORROW. BORROWED AGAINST MONEY THAT WE WERE GONNA GIVE YOU, DONATE YOU. SO WE DIDN’T WORK FOR IT? IT’S A FUCKIN' GIFT. SO, WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE RECORD DEAL AS A GIFT AND WE DIDN’T WORK FOR IT? DO YOU THINK THAT YOU’RE ENTITLED TO OUR RECORD MONEY? I WORKED FOR IT. IF ONE--IF ONE DOLLAR CAME MY WAY FROM ANY OF THE 4 OF YOU, THAT’S A DOLLAR THAT I WORKED FOR. I DON’T LOOK AT IT AS A GIFT TO ME. WELL, LET’S NOT JERK EACH OTHER OFF. YOU SAW SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR YOURSELF, AND THAT’S WHY YOU DID IT. IF WE SUCKED AND WE WERE JUST FRIENDS OF YOURS, YOU WOULDN’T HAVE DONE SHIT FOR THE FUCKIN’ BAND. I DON’T BELIEVE YOU SHOULD GET PAID ONE FUCKIN’ PLUGGED NICKEL. AS THIS FUCKIN’ SITUATION ESCALATES, YOU’RE GONNA GET PAID WHAT YOU FUCKIN’ DESERVE. AS WE BEGIN TO BUILD OUR COMPANY, EVERYBODY HERE’S GONNA HAVE SOME FUCKIN’ DEEP POCKETS WHEN WE’RE ALL DONE. AND YOU’RE--YOU'RE PUTTING THIS VEIL OVER IT LIKE, HEY, WE DESERVE IT. WE DESERVE IT BECAUSE WE WORK FOR THE BAND. I DON’T BELIEVE YOU DESERVE A THING FOR THE WORK THAT YOU’VE DONE FOR THIS BAND. YOU SAW OPPORTUNITY FOR YOURSELF. THAT’S WHY YOU DID IT, PERIOD. AND THAT OPPORTUNITY STILL EXISTS TODAY. YOU MIGHT BE FUCKIN’ SURPRISED WHAT-- WHAT WE ALL FUCKIN’ LEARNED DURING THIS WHOLE PROCESS, TONY, ’CAUSE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, NOBODY HAS EVER FOUND THE LEVELS THAT WE’RE AT. NOBODY HAS EVER BEEN DIRECTING A FILM AND RECORDING A FUCKIN’ SOUNDTRACK WITH A BAND THAT’S JUST BEEN SIGNED FOR 5 FUCKIN’ ALBUMS WITH THE BIGGEST FUCKIN’ RECORD LABEL IN THIS WORLD. NOBODY’S EVER DONE THAT, BUT WE ARE. IT UPSETS ME TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT WE DON’T DESERVE ANYTHING THAT WE WORKED FOR. YOU KNOW WHAT? DESERVE IS THE WRONG WORD. YOU ARE--I AM WRONG. YOU DO DESERVE IT, BUT YOU’RE NOT GONNA GET IT. AT THIS JUNCTURE. YEAH, AT THIS JUNCTURE, YOU DON’T DESERVE THAT, BUDDY. WITHOUT A DOUBT. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT ONE, PLEASE? NO. IF THERE’S NO MONEY TO BE HAD RIGHT NOW, I WOULD NEVER ASK FOR ANY MONEY. DUDE, WHOA! HOLD ON A SECOND. ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? ARE YOU GONNA PUT A MENTAL FUCKING NOTE IN YOUR HEAD THAT SOMEDAY YOU MAY SEE SOME MONEY FROM THIS? THAT’S INSANE TO ME. I’D RATHER JUST SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU’RE RIGHT. I DON’T DESERVE IT. IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY, AND I LOOK AT IT AS THAT, ’CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN PROBABLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY GET THROUGH IT, IS TO GO, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT DID PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR ME. BUT FOR YOU TO PUT A MENTAL NOTE TO MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER TO GET THROUGH THIS BY SAYING, WELL, SOME ARE GONNA WHINE, YOU’RE CRAZY. YOU’RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKIN' MIND. YOU ARE. LET HIM TALK. COME ON. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? ALL HE’S SAYING IN THIS WHOLE THING-- I DON’T THINK YOU GUYS ARE REALLY SEEING IT-- HE’S SAYING THIS IS MONEY WE HAVE EARNED. YOU GUYS ARE FUCKIN’ AMAZING. IT’S ARE FUCKING MONEY, PERIOD. I DON’T WANT TO FEEL-- NO, I DON’T WANT TO FEEL UNDESERVING OR GUILTY OR ANYTHING, BECAUSE ME AND THIS FUCKING KID WERE AT THERE AT THE VERY FUCKING BEGINNING OF THIS GODDAMN THING. WE’RE IN THAT GODDAMN CIGAR SHOP-- WHO ARE YOU? I’M NOT TALKING ABOUT-- I’M NOT TALKING ABOUT... WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL? YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL, TONY? I FEEL THAT MAYBE YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT FUCKING UNDESERVING. I FEEL THAT I’M UNDESERVING OF ALL YOUR FUCKING BULLSHIT. FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU. SINCE WHEN DOESN’T HOW ANY OF US FEEL MATTER? YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT DOESN’T HAVE ANY-- IT DOESN’T FUCKIN' MATTER! WE’RE TALKIN' BUSINESS! WE’RE TALKIN' ABOUT BUSINESS RIGHT NOW. IT DOESN’T HAVE TO DO WITH HOW I TREAT YOU AT A FUCKIN’ BARBECUE. I DON’T CARE HOW YOU FEEL. FUCK YOU! AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, MARK, IF YOU AGREE WITH THIS SHIT, FUCK YOU, TOO. [TAPPING] TAYLOR, SKIP THAT FIRST ONE. WE’LL GO TO SOMETHING ELSE. WHAT? I WANT TO TAKE IT OUT AND DO SOMETHING ELSE DIFFERENT. YEAH, BUT IS IT GONNA BE THAT LENGTH OF TIME? YEAH, IT’LL BE THAT LENGTH OF TIME. SO LEAVE IT IN THERE FOR NOW. LEAVE IT IN. I’M SAYING I’M TELLING MY BROTHER NOT TO PLAY A SOLO DURING THAT PART. I’M NOT CHANGING ANYTHING. I WANT TO TALK TO THE 3 OF YOU FOR ONE SECOND. COME ON OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE. WE’RE TOTALLY ON THE PROBLEM. THESE 2 GUYS CAN’T FUCKIN’ HELP US. YOU KNOW? THEY’RE BASICALLY--YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID RIGHT THERE-- THEY’RE BASICALLY... 2 ENEMIES OF US. THAT’S WHAT THEY ARE. THEIR RECORD COMPANY’S THEIR BOSS, WE’RE NOT. WE’RE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE TO HAVE THE NUTS ENOUGH TO STAND UP FOR WHAT WE’RE EVEN-- WHAT WE’RE GONNA DO HERE. AND IT’S NOT GONNA BE FUN. IT’S GONNA BE A GODDAMN NIGHTMARE. WE CAN ONLY HOPE BY THE END OF IT... THAT WE GOT A GOOD FUCKIN’ PRODUCT THAT WE BELIEVE IN. WE SHOULDN’T EXPECT ANYTHING ANYMORE. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY PUTTING UP A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS, THAT’S CHICKEN FEED TO THEM, AND LOOK HOW FUCKIN’-- LOOK HOW JEWISH THEY’RE BEING ABOUT IT. AFTER IT’S ALL SAID AND DONE AND THEY GOT THIS GREAT FUCKIN’ ALBUM, THEY’RE GONNA GO, "SEE WHAT WE DID FOR YOU? WE WERE BEHIND YOU." AND ALL YOU’RE GONNA WANT TO DO IS CHEW THEIR FUCKIN’ FACES OFF AND GO, YOU FUCKIN’ COCKSUCKER, YOU FUCK ME EVERY DAY. I HATE YOU. I HATE YOU ALL. I DON’T THINK I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT. [AIRPLANE] [BARKING] THIS IS WHERE KEITH RICHARDS STAYS WHEN HE COMES HERE. ’CAUSE IT'S DARK AND THERE’S NO WINDOWS. THAT’S THE WAY HE LIKES IT. PRETTY COOL. THIS IS WHERE I’M STAYING. [FOOTSTEPS] YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT ONE SHOT IN LIFE. YOU’VE GOT ONE SHOT IN LIFE TO FILM YOUR FIRST MOVIE. ONE SHOT IN LIFE TO RECORD YOUR FIRST ALBUM. DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, EVER, OR REGULARLY? YOU KNOW, I DON’T KNOW WHY I DON’T THINK ABOUT THAT, BUT I DON’T. I DON’T KNOW WHY I’M NOT SCARED. AT ALL. VERY, VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE ALL--ALL THE NECESSARY INGREDIENTS FOR ULTIMATE SELF-CONFIDENCE. GAAH! WHEN I SEE THE GUYS IN THE BAND, I WONDER, IS THERE ANY REAL PLEASURE IN IT? OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE? MY ONLY QUESTION IS, OK, WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM? AND WHY DO THEY DO THAT? I’M STILL FUCKIN' WORRIED ABOUT... TAYLOR AND GORDO AND THIS WHOLE ROCK STAR THING. ’CAUSE THEY LIKE TO ACT LIKE ROCK STARS SOMETIMES EVEN THOUGH THEY AIN’T YET. THEY GET THAT KIND OF AFFLUENCE AND POWER... IT SCARES THE SHIT OUT OF ME WITH THOSE GUYS. THEY CASHED THE BIGGEST PAYCHECK OF THEIR FUCKIN’ LIVES, AND THEY’RE ABOUT TO-- THEY CASHED ANOTHER ONE RIGHT BEFORE WE STARTED THIS, AND THEY’RE GONNA GET ANOTHER ONE AFTER THIS. IT SOUNDS GREAT, DOESN’T IT? IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY SHOULD BE COMING UP TO ME AND GOING, "THANKS, MAN. NICE JOB." AND THESE GUYS SOMETIMES THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE THEY’RE IN A GOOD BAND, AND JUST BECAUSE THEY MAKE GOOD MUSIC, THEY WOULD HAVE GOT THE GODDAMN RECORD DEAL ANYWAY. I KNOW THAT WOULDN’T HAVE HAPPENED. WELL, LET’S FACE IT. NONE OF THESE GUYS GOT THE FUCKIN’ DRIVE TO DO THAT, DUDE. AND THEY’RE ALL, LIKE, FUCKIN’, "OH, THIS IS A BAND. WE ALL DID THIS." DID WE ALL DO THIS? I DON’T THINK SO. I’VE DONE SO MUCH IN THE LAST 2 YEARS THAT MOST PEOPLE DON’T EVEN GET A CHANCE TO DREAM ABOUT IN THEIR WHOLE LIVES. MAYBE I GOT A COUPLE OF THINGS FIGURED OUT TO MAKE ALL THIS SHIT WORK. IF HIS OPINION HAS BEEN VALIDATED BY SUCCESS, THEN HE MAY FEEL THAT VALIDATES EVERYTHING. TAYLOR IS BRILLIANT. THAT’S NOT TO SAY TROY ISN’T. BUT TAYLOR IS. I DON’T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE WITHOUT TAYLOR. I DON’T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD APPEAL TO ME AS MUCH. SO IN THAT AREA, IT’S VERY DIFFICULT... TO SAY WHO’S THE CHIEF AND WHO’S THE INDIAN THERE. HOW YOU SOLVE THAT PROBLEM... [TAKES DEEP BREATH] THAT’S A DIFFICULT CALL. FLOM, HE SAID, "WHY DID YOU SEND THIS TO ME?" DID HE SAY THAT? YEAH. WELL, HE SAYS IT TAKES 2 MINUTES TO GET TO THE CHORUS. WELL, I SAID, JASON, THAT’S JUST THE FIRST THING WE DID, AND, UH... HE SAYS, "I NEED TO HEAR THE OTHER STUFF. I WANT TO HEAR THE PAYOFF." THE PAYOFF? NOW I GOTTA DO ROUGH MIXES OF EVERYTHING AND SEND THAT TO HIM SO HE SEES WHAT THE HELL WE’RE DOING. OF EVERYTHING? I THINK IT’S PROBABLY A GOOD METHOD OF OPERATION FOR ALL OF US TO IGNORE, TILL THE DAY WE DIE, WHAT MOVIE GUYS’ AND RECORD GUYS’ OPINIONS ARE. I THINK EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE FUCKIN’ RECEIVED AS IT SHOULD. WELL, I DON’T KNOW IF I AGREE WITH THAT, BECAUSE-- IF IT’S RECEIVED... IF THE SHOOT IS GOOD. WHAT IF NOT ENOUGH MONEY’S SPENT ON PUBLICITY AND GETTING THE WORD OUT THERE ON BOTH-- BOTH, YOU KNOW, THE FILM AND THE MUSIC? WELL, WHY WOULD SOMEBODY INVEST THIS MUCH MONEY AND THEN FUCKIN’ BLOW IT ALL OFF? THEY INVEST IN MOVIES AND IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WHEN THEY RELEASE A MOVIE. IF MIRAMAX BUYS THE MOVIE, HE COULD BUR--HE COULD BURY IT. JUST ’CAUSE HE FEELS LIKE IT ’CAUSE HE'S HAVING A BAD DAY. HE COULD. HARVEY HAS THAT POWER. IT’S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE. AND I THINK I’D BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MOVIE AT THIS JUNCTURE THAN THE MUSIC. AND I WOULD SAY--I WOULD SAY I WOULD STEER THE FUCK CLEAR FROM MIRAMAX. I AM MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE BOONDOCK SAINTS, THE FATE OF THE BOONDOCK SAINTS... WELL, THAT’S WHAT I’M SAYING. I’D STEER CLEAR FROM FUCKIN’ MIRAMAX. I’D STEER CLEAR FROM THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS, ’CAUSE THERE'S BAD BLOOD BETWEEN THE TWO OF THOSE GUYS. YOU THINK HARVEY’S GONNA COME ACROSS WITH A BIG FAT FUCKIN’ SMILE LIKE HE DID BEFORE AND THEN BURY THE FUCKIN’ THING, LIKE A BIG FAT COCKSUCKER. I THINK THAT, UH, FROM WHAT WE SEEN, YOU KNOW. JUST IN THE PRE-PRODUCTION AND THE SHOOTING-- YEAH, THAT’S WHAT I SAID. THE SHOOTING-- A FAT FUCKIN’--WHAT? I THINK WHAT WE JUST SAW WITH THE SHOOTING OF THE MOVIE AND EVERYTHING THAT’S FOLLOWED IT, THE BOONDOCK SAINTS IS IN FOR A HELL OF A ROAD STILL. A LONG WAY. I DON’T THINK IT SHOULD GO WITH MIRAMAX, JUST FOR THE FEAR OF, YOU KNOW, SOME FUCKIN’ BAD BLOOD AND THE GUY JUST FUCKIN’ BURY IT JUST ’CAUSE. HE’S GOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CANNES TO DO STUPID SHIT LIKE THAT. HEY, WE LOVE YOUR MOVIE. THANKS. CAN YOU SAY SHELVE? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WE ARE FINALLY GIVING BIRTH! BIRTH TO THIS BABY! MINGUS--WHAT A NAME! MINGUS DOSHAN REEDUS. AWW! WHAT’S UP? SAY, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] HOW ARE YOU? GREAT. HOW’S THE DOCUMENTARY COMING ALONG? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [APPLAUSE] THE, UH, THE PAGER AND CELL PHONE THING-- I CAN’T...SAY IT ENOUGH. YOU SHUT ’EM OFF NOW. YOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO SHUT ’EM OFF, ’CAUSE I'LL FIND YOU IN THE DARK. I’LL FOLLOW THE FUCKIN' LITTLE BEEP AND I’LL GET YOU. [LAUGHTER] YOU WANT INDEPENDENT? WE’RE FUCKIN' INDEPENDENT. [LAUGHTER] WE’RE VERY INDEPENDENT. [CELL PHONE RINGS] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING, AND APPLAUDING] [RING] THIS CAN’T BE GOOD. HELLO. [LAUGHTER] [INDISTINCT VOICE ON CELL PHONE] KISS MY ASS. WHO IS IT? I KNOW YOU’RE IN THE ROOM. FUCK YOU, DUDE. [LAUGHTER] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [LAUGHING] YOU AND I HAVE PUNCHED THROUGH A GRANITE FUCKIN’ MOUNTAIN WITH OUR BARE FISTS AND SET THIS THING UP. ALL THE CREDIT I WANT TO GIVE YOU AND ALL THE CREDIT YOU WANT TO GIVE ME, THAT’S ALL FUCKIN’ WONDERFUL. YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS WHOLE FUCKIN’ BUSINESS IS LIKE A GODDAMN HIGH SCHOOL PLAYGROUND. THE BIGGEST BULLY OWNS EVERYTHING. RIGHT, AND YOU’RE THE BIGGEST BULLY. TECHNICALLY, ME AND C.B. ARE THE BIGGEST BULLIES. GIVE ME A FUCKIN’ HIGH FIVE. HE IS THE BIGGEST BULLY. AND THAT’S THE ONLY REASON THAT ANYONE IS AFRAID OF ME. OH, THAT IS IT. THEY’RE AFRAID OF YOU BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU’RE A REAL GODDAMN PLAYER. SHOW THOSE TO THE CAMERA. YOU ARE SO FUCKIN’ DIRTY. I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU SO HARD. YEAH, I’LL GET US ALL SOME PUSSY. YEAH, GET SOME PUSSY. I CAN’T SEEM TO FIND A WOMAN WITH JUST THAT VERY SIMPLE THING. WHO’S JUST A GOOD FUCKIN’ PERSON. WHOA. [GIGGLING] INTELLIGENT, GOOD-LOOKING, LIKES THE SAME THINGS YOU DO, AND IS A GOOD PERSON INSIDE. THAT’S WHAT YOU WANTED TO ASK ME, IF SHE SWALLOWED? NO, NO! THIS IS MY GIRL WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH ALL OF THIS WITH ME AND HAS ACTUALLY SUPPORTED ME FINANCIALLY AND PUT ME UP IN HER HOUSE AND LOVED ME AND BEEN MY BEST FRIEND. HE’S BEEN WANTING TO FUCK ME FOR A REAL LONG TIME NOW AND I’M NOT GONNA LET HIM. HE WANTS TO FUCK ME IN THE ASS. Troy: YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING A PIMP? FUCK YOU! I’M ABOUT TO FALL OVER DRUNK! OK? GOD, I’M SO HAMMERED. I LOVE THIS. HEY, WATCH. HA HA HA! [HORN HONKS] THEY FUCKED WITH US! HARVEY WEINSTEIN’S A BIG FAT COCK! Troy: DUDE, YOU’RE GONNA GET IN TROUBLE. FUCK HIM! FUCK THAT GUY. TROY AND C.B. AND EVERYBODY IN THE CIRCLE OF-- HAS HAD THIS AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A FILM, TO MAKE A RECORD, TO MAKE A DOCUMENTARY. AND I DON’T BELIEVE THAT THERE’VE BEEN A LOT OF INSTANCES WHERE A GROUP THIS LARGE HAS HAD THIS MANY OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED TO THEM. HA HA HA! YOU GUYS IN THE BAND, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS ISN’T QUITE AS ENJOYABLE AS IT LOOKS. SERIOUSLY. NOW THIS FILM IN MY OPINION WILL GO BIG AT THE BOX OFFICE, REAL BIG. I THINK IT’S ONE OF THE BEST INDEPENDENT FILMS EVER MADE, AND I KNOW THAT I’M ONE OF THE BEST THAT THERE IS, AND I’M GONNA BE THE BEST. I THINK WE DESERVE 8 FIGURES ABOVE 10. ABOVE 10 MILLION FOR THE FILM. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I DON’T THINK IT'S GONNA BE A FEEDING FRENZY. I THINK THEY’RE GONNA LIKE THE MOVIE, BUT LIKING THE MOVIE AND GETTING THE CALLS BACK FOR, YOU KNOW, AN OFFER TO BUY THE FILM ARE 2 DIFFERENT THINGS. [SIREN] WELCOME TO OUR PAD! BONJOUR! BONJOUR! COMMENT CA VA? CA VA BIEN! OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THIS VIEW! WE’RE AT CANNES! AWESOME. HOW GREAT AN OFFICE IS THIS? WE’VE GOT A POOL BACK THERE. THIS IS GREAT. FEEL LIKE MOVING HERE. HA HA! OH, MY CHRIST, YES! WE BELIEVE IN THE PICTURE SO STRONGLY WE’RE NOT WORRIED. Troy: YOU HAVEN’T SEEN IT YET, HUH? Tony: WHAT IS THE BIGGEST CONCLUSION YOU’VE REACHED ABOUT THE BUSINESS AND THE BIGGEST QUESTION THAT REMAINS? HOW THE HELL DO I GET OUT OF THIS BUSINESS? HA HA HA! IT’S ALL ABOUT MONEY? YES. HA HA HA! IT’S ALL ABOUT ASS. NO, IT’S ALL ABOUT MONEY. HA HA HA! DON’T TRUST ANYBODY. ESPECIALLY ME. HA HA HA! THERE ARE PLOTS ALL AROUND YOU. DEFINITELY. ROME HAS NOTHING ON US. HA HA HA! [CAWING] YEAH, EITHER THIS HAS BEEN MISHANDLED LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER OR, UH, SOMETHING’S GOING ON THAT WE DON’T KNOW ABOUT. Tony: WHY IS IT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO WAIT TO HEAR FROM SOMEBODY VERSUS BEING ABLE TO ASK SOMEBODY WHAT’S GOING ON? WELL, I DID. WE DID JUST ASK SOMEBODY WHAT WAS GOING ON. WE ASKED THE PERSON WHO HAS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE OUTCOME OF THE ENTIRETY OF THIS FILM. THEY DIDN’T HAVE ANYTHING FOR US. I SEE. WHERE’S THE OFFER? WHAT’S GOING ON HERE? WELL, THEY DON’T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THEY DON’T WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT’S ACTUALLY GOING ON. TROY’S A CLIENT HERE, AND YET MIRAMAX FARMS SO MUCH TALENT FROM HERE, MUCH OF THEIR TALENT FOR THEIR FILMS HOW DO YOU OR RAMSES’ AGENTS DEAL WITH THAT? THERE ISN’T A CONFLICT. Taylor: YOU’RE MY BROTHER AND I LOVE YOU AND I MEAN THAT, BUT, UH... I’VE PRETTY MUCH REACHED THE END OF, UH, THE END OF MY ROPE. I, UH... I DON’T BELIEVE THAT THE BAND HAS BEEN, UH, NUMBER ONE IN YOUR LIFE, NOT FOR A LONG TIME. YOU HAVE CHANGED BIG TIME, AND, UH, I WOULDN’T SAY IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. YOU’VE SAID SOME THING THAT HAVE INDICATED THAT WE WOULD BE NOTHING WITHOUT YOUR SCRIPT AND WE WOULDN’T BE WHERE WE ARE TODAY, AND MAYBE WE WOULDN’T BE, BUT I’LL TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE’D BE SOMEWHERE. STATEMENTS LIKE, "I DON’T NEED TO DO THIS ANYMORE. "I CAN DO MOVIES FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. I’M ALREADY IN." I MEAN, WE GOT FUCKED WITH CONTINUALLY AND STILL WE WERE THERE. WE SAT BY AND WE WAITED. AND WHEN THE MOVIE WAS FINALLY DONE NOTHING CHANGED. WE NEED YOU. ALL OF YOU. THERE’S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS BAND [EXHALES] I HAVE NEVER FELT AS... I’VE NEVER FELT AS LOW AS I FEEL RIGHT-- RIGHT--FUCK! [EXHALES] LOOK, MAN. I DON’T HATE YOU. I LOVE YOU. BUT I DON’T TRUST YOU. THIS IS THE FIRST FUCKING TIME YOU’VE ACTUALLY CALLED A MEETING OF THIS BAND AND HAD ANYTHING TO FUCKING SAY. UP TO NOW IT’S BEEN ME. I’VE BEEN DOING ALL THE FUCKING WORK. AS FOR MY FILM CAREER, GET USED IT BECAUSE IT AIN’T GOING ANYWHERE, PERIOD. SO IF THAT’S YOUR FUCKING BOTTOM LINE THEN--PFFT! SCREW YOU. SCREW YOU, MAN. I DON’T GIVE A FLYING FUCK BECAUSE I’M AT THE END OF MY FUCKING ROPE. [BARKING] Photographer: OK, GUYS. AND I THINK IT’S CURIOUS THAT YOU WOULD NOT TRY AGAIN. LIKE YOU GET ALMOST TO THAT POINT AND YOU DON’T SUCCEED WITH THIS ONE, YOU SAID YOU DON’T WANT TO DO IT EVER AGAIN-- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE AFTER YOU HAVE BROKEN YOUR FUCKING ASS WIDE OPEN A THOUSAND TIMES, BEEN TOLD TO FUCK OFF, GOTTEN YOUR HEART PULLED OUT AND SHOVED DOWN YOUR THROAT? I’M KIND OF PAYING A COMPLIMENT WITHOUT-- I’M JUST SAYING-- WELL, THEN I GUESS I’M AN ASSHOLE. I’M SAYING MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE PROUD OF WHAT YOU-- I DON’T KNOW--EVEN IF IT DOESN’T COME OUT. I’M PROUD OF IT. SEE, THIS IS LIKE-- WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT NOW, THIS IS A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH MY SISTER. BEING A FILM STUDENT, YOU GET LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN HERE. THEY’RE REALLY OPTIMISTIC AND THEY’RE ALL LIKE, UH-- I DON’T KNOW. YOU GOTTA KEEP GOING, AND IF THE FIRST ONE DOESN’T WORK YOU JUST KEEP GOING AND DOING WHATEVER. YOU SEEM TO BE ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BOAT. IT’S LIKE YOUR OWN MAMA SLAPPING YOU A HUNDRED TIMES AND THEN SAYING, "I’M SORRY," AND THEN DOING IT AGAIN. YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH IT. IN FACT I CAN TELL THAT YOU’RE NOT GONNA. YOU IN PARTICULAR. OPINIONATED ASS-FUCKING FILM STUDENTS ARE ABOUT THE MOST PUTRID LOT I COULD THINK OF. THESE FUCKERS DO NOT UNDERSTAND. NOBODY AT THE RECORD LABEL UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH. NO OTHER BANDS HAVE HAD IN THE PAST. I HAVE TO SHOW THESE MOTHERFUCKERS HOW TO DO THIS, WHICH I DO BECAUSE RECORDS COMPANIES ARE USED TO DOING THINGS IN A SPECIFIC WAY. AND I THINK WE HAVE BEEN RIGHT ALL ALONG. AND NOBODY LISTENED TO US. FINE. FINE. WE’LL DO IT OURSELVES AND WE’LL SHOW YOU. FINE, WE’LL SHOW YOU, TOO. WE WILL SHOW YOU. IT’S JUST GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY REALLY HERE IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN THE CORRECT MANNER TO SHOW YOU THE NEW DEAL. DO YOUR FUCKING JOB, ASSHOLE. I DON’T WANT TO FUCKING HOLD ANYBODY’S GODDAMN HAND ALL THE TIME. FUCK YOU. KICK INTO HIGH GEAR. GET THE SINGLE OUT NEXT WEEK. GO, STOP, GO, STOP, STOP, GO, GO, GO. SEE YA. CLICK. AND I DON’T CARE IF IT'S IN A BROWN PAPER BAG AS THE ARTWORK. GET IT OUT THERE. SO AT THE END OF THE DAY WE’RE GONNA SHOW THESE COCKSUCKERS THEN THAT’S WHAT WE'LL DO. WE’LL SHOW THEM ALL. [NO AUDIO] EVERYBODY WAS DYING TO BE IN TROY’S POSITION, YOU KNOW? EVERYBODY WAS. AND WE’D PICK UP THE-- I REMEMBER MY HUSBAND PICKING UP THE DAILY VARIETY AND THE REPORTER AND GO, "THIS SHOULD BE ME. I WANT THIS TO BE ME." YOU KNOW? AND NOBODY WAS GONNA TOUCH THIS FILM BECAUSE OF THE BAD BLOOD THAT HAD HAPPENED. NO MATTER HOW HARD TROY TRIED TO GET IT OFF THE GROUND, IT WAS GONNA BE DESTROYED. HOW MUCH INFLUENCE DOES HARVEY HAVE IN THIS TOWN? ALL. EVERYTHING. I THINK-- I THINK HE HAS EVERY-- HE’S--YEAH, GODLIKE. FROM THE MOMENT THAT HARVEY PASSED ON THE FILM, THE MOVIE-- NOBODY WAS GONNA TOUCH IT. FOR THE REASON THAT HE WAS HARVEY’S GUY, HARVEY FOUND HIM, HARVEY BROUGHT HIM OUT INTO THE PUBLIC EYE, MADE HIM A STAR, SET HIM UP, GAVE HIM ALL THESE OPPORTUNITIES, AND TROY BLEW IT. AND THEN I RAN INTO HARVEY AT THE, UM... OSCARS THIS YEAR. HARVEY WAS SITTING WITH HIS WIFE IN HIS BOOTH, AND THIS GREAT BIG PLATTER OF SUSHI IN FRONT OF HIM, AND I SAID, "HEY, HARVEY, I’M SHARON WAXMAN WITH THE WASHINGTON POST." "SO, YOU’RE SHARON." HE GOES, "WAS I RIGHT ABOUT TROY DUFFY OR WHAT?" [LAUGHING] THAT’S THE FIRST THING HE SAID. HE HAD ALL THESE MOVIES NOMINATED FOR THE OSCARS AND THE FIRST THING OUT OF HIS MOUTH WAS BOONDOCK SAINTS. THAT’S THE POINT. WHICH IS A TINY MOVIE HE’D PASSED ON AGES AGO. HIS ATTITUDE IS, PROBABLY, "I MADE YOU. I CAN UNMAKE YOU." YOU KNOW? OR, "I MADE YOU. YOU DON’T APPRECIATE IT. FUCK YOU." [WIND BLOWING] THE SAINTS HAS BEEN BLACKLISTED, IT’S BEEN BLACKLISTED BY HARVEY. THE FUCKIN’ TABLES WERE OBVIOUSLY RIGGED. SOMEBODY WAS FEEDING MIRAMAX INFORMATION. WILLIAM MORRIS IS OBVIOUSLY, UH, IN HARVEY’S HIP FUCKIN’ POCKET. WE FIGURED THESE COCKSUCKERS OUT. THIS IS ALL VERY PERSONAL. IT’S BETWEEN HE AND I. HE WANTS TO BE ME. HE WANTS TO BE THE NEW HOT, YOUNG FILM-MAKER FROM THE STREETS DOING HIS VISION AND GETTING THINGS DONE HIS WAY AND BEING THE BAD-ASS. NOW, WE MIGHT HAVE TO START PULLING SOME FUG SHIT, LIKE THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN PULLING ON US FOR THE LONGEST FUCKING TIME. IT TAKES REVOLUTION. WELL, THEN LET’S GO TO WAR HERE. HARVEY WEINSTEIN IS AFRAID OF ME. IF YOU’RE ABLE TO SCARE THEM, YOU’RE ABLE TO MAKE THEM PAY. I’VE READ A LOT OF REVIEWS, AND I THOUGHT IT WAS, YOU KNOW, OVER THE TOP. I MEAN, THE ONLY GOOD THING WAS SOME TECHNICAL-- [TIRES SCREECHING] [CRASH] [SHOUTING] EVERYBODY OK? Woman: I’M ALL RIGHT. YOU OK? I TOLD YOU THIS IS... [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Woman: ARE YOU OK? YEAH, I’M OK. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SCANNER BEEPING] CHOP THAT. [RAINING] [COUGHS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] GO. [GRUNTING]
