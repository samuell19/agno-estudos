# The falling leaves # Drift by the window # The autumn leaves # Of red and gold # I see your lips # The summer kisses # The sunburned hand # I used to hold # Since you went away # The days grow long # And soon I'll hear # Old winter's song # But I miss you most of all # My darling # When autumn leaves # Start to fall # Well, that's that. Come in. Liz - I can't believe it. It's me all right - old unfaithful. Picked up your evening paper. Thanks. Haven't seen you for ages. Where have you been? Working day and night. Just like you, Milly. Good to see you again. Be with you in a minute. OK. Present for you. Ain't had a chance to socialise much but I hear you type yourself silly. It's a rush job. He's coming by any minute. What's this? Some typing for you somebody left with me by mistake. I'm glad somebody made that mistake. You don't want to be one of those people who just drop by for the rent. If you behave like a landlady, I'll complain about that squeaking door. That's life. If it ain't a squeak it's a squawk. Sit there and I'll make tea and we'll drink your squeaks and squawks away. I wish I could... but I ain't got time to breathe. I gotta rush over to see my brother. D'you ever meet him? I dunno. Did I? The one who married that blonde pain from Alabama, tall and skinny but all muscle. My brother, I mean. At least you have a family. You can't win that on a quiz show. Those guys are never late. Come in, Mr Ramsey. Afternoon. Good afternoon. Have I come too early? Nope. That's great. Simply great. It's all finished! 126 pages. Isn't it great? How should I know? I ain't read it. Miss Wetherby's speed - incredible. Now I can get this to my publisher. I don't know how to thank you. I'd like to give you more than your fee. Mr Ramsey, you always pay your bill on time. I'm glad you're happy. Wait! Here. Two tickets for tonight. I assume you like good music? Oh, I do. But thank you, no, I couldn't accept them. Well, my lady friend doesn't care much for that music. Please? Please? Symphony Hall! This is very kind of you, Mr Ramsey. Not at all. I hope you enjoy it. Thank you. Oh, yes! I never thought this would be 126 pages. Well... goodbye everybody. Your manuscript! Oh, I'm sorry. Thanks again. Let me see those tickets. Second balcony. Cheap crumb! Whatever you say, you're wrong. He's poor. This is a sweet gesture. Second balcony. Any higher you'd get a nosebleed! You're the world champ when it comes to believing these chisellers! He could at least ask you out - or did he want to save the bus fare? He almost did once. Well, ain't that somethin'? What stopped him? What?! That's the story of my life. He was so sure I was tied up with my "gentlemen friends". What gentlemen friends? Liz, didn't you see that mob out there waiting to take me out? Hey, what kind of tea do you drink? I've been told so often "You're so attractive, lovely, so this, so that" Then they assume I'm all tied up! All tied up! Makes me feel like a package and I'm left alone! If you ask me, you give 'em the brushoff. Don't ask me why. Maybe I'm just too choosy? Maybe you're just plain scared? Whatever the reason, I have two tickets for tonight. Be my guest? Thanks but I can't. For nine reasons First, I can't stand that music. What happened to the other eight reasons? Then there's my brother. That did it. I'll go alone. I'm gonna get out of here and make a night of it. To each his own. It's better than sitting here by your lonesome. Believe me, I oughta know. I'm an expert on being alone. Yah. I've gotten used to living alone, too. That's why I'm gonna get out of here. To the recital. I'm going to have myself a ball! Gardenia. Gardenia. One dollar. Gardenias, madam. Is it possible to exchange two balconies for one orchestra? Yes, ma'am. One orchestra. Gardenias, madam. Gardenias. Thank you. - Thank you, madam. Hello? Oh, Paul. I'm afraid I can't make it tonight. "Your father again?" I'm sorry, Paul, but I have to be fair. "How about being fair to me? We can't go on this way." "Milly, you've got so much to give. Don't throw your life away." Paul. Paul, you used to be so understanding. "Sure I did. But I can't take it any more." "It's either him or me. If you won't make up your mind, somebody has to make it up for you!" Now, Milly, I want you to go out. I don't want to be the reason for you breaking every date with Paul. He's been such a patient young man. Too patient. It's all right. You'll get well soon, then we'll all make up for lost time. You're a good daughter but I'm not getting any better. You just can't tie yourself down to me. Don't worry about me. I've plenty of time. There's plenty of time. Last booth's open, lady. Be with you in a minute. Thank you. You'll have to wait a minute, mister. We're full up. What'll you have? Anything quick. Er, chicken salad, no bread. Anything to drink? - No, thank you. Mind if join you? Please? I'm sorry, I'd prefer you didn't. Oh! I didn't mean to sound rude. You're alone. This is the only empty spot. Empty except for you, I mean. I'd still prefer you didn't. I only asked because there's really no other place to sit down. I'm accustomed to sitting... I prefer to sit alone. That's OK, I can wait for you to finish your salad. I'd have to gulp it with you waiting. No, don't do that, please. You just take your time. I can stand. You get used to standing in the army Well, if you're going to stand there you might as well sit here. You, er... sure it's all right? I suppose. You know something? You're lonely. Lonely? I think you're being rather presumptuous. My private life is personal. I'm just stating a fact. You can correct me, I'll stand corrected... but sitting down. Joke. It's no disgrace to be lonely. Nowadays everybody's lonely. I'm tired and my feet hurt but that isn't why I'm glad I'm here I'm glad because you look like somebody I'd like to talk to. Really? - Uh-huh. But you know what I see in your face? Fear. Why? Cos you don't know me. That sounds reasonable but frankly it's cockeyed. You shouldn't be afraid of me. I think it's a matter of opinion. I think... I don't know what I think. I'm sorry. I'll keep quiet. I won't talk any more if you prefer. I do prefer! Yes? I didn't say anything. But the way you were staring. No, I promised I wouldn't say anything. But you were staring at me. No, not at you. At your purse. Oh. Yes. I like your taste in music. About that purse? Purse? If you were to drop it, no matter which way it came up you'd always know it was yours. May I? Up... down. Either way it's always the same - MW. Is that a reason for staring? Mary Walker? I beg your pardon? Mildred... Williams? Oh! Am I right? - No. Well, not Martha Washington?! No, Millicent Wetherby. Millicent Wetherby. Milly? That's right. Burt Hanson. Formerly Sergeant Hanson of the US Army. How d'you do. How do you do. Well, what are you gonna have? Um, the same as Miss Wetherby. A quick chicken salad. Right. Except now we don't have to go... ...do we? No. So... relax. Am I tense? You're stuck with me for the duration of that salad. You might as well go ahead, talk, say something. I'm not very good at this casual conversation. Sure you are. You haven't stopped talking since I sat down. Are you teasing me? Mm-hm. Like I did about your purse. I want you to relax. So we can talk. You see, people don't realise how important that is - talking to somebody who listens. You're the best listener since Matsu Rikyoto. Since who? Matsu Rikyoto. A 12-year-old kid in Tokyo, sold those paper-dragon kites You were with the army in Tokyo? Honour Guard, headquarters. No hero stuff. We never even left Japan. With what I learnt as a supply sergeant, I'll do fine in this town. You work in LA? - Yes, three years now. I like LA. I'm gonna make good here. I'm sure you will. Where're you from? Before the army? Mm-hm. Racine, Wisconsin. You ever been to Racine? - No. You native Californian? An immigrant from New England. I have two sisters and a brother back there and their children. I can't imagine anyone ever leaving their family if they're lucky enough to have one. I never knew my mother, my father died when I was so high. Hey, let's not depress each other. OK. Then there's the other side. A fella sits down next to you you've never seen. All you know about him is he spent a couple of soft years in Tokyo and kidded you about your purse. Now he's showing off by picking up the check. That's the kind of character you got a perfect right to be suspicious of. Frankly, I think our relationship will last a lot longer if the first time you pick up your own check. OK? When I finished business school I could type 70 words a minute or more. Then came the secretarial jobs. I found it more fun to work at home. I like the feeling of independence. Maybe it's my New England heritage, that I'm so frugal. Living and working at home means you only have one rent to pay. I haven't stopped talking since downtown. And the way you've listened! You're heroic. Don't worry about me. Live and laugh, that's what I always say. Agree? Sure you do. Hey, this is very nice. Hi, Liz, I'd like you... - I'm glad you had a good time! Tonight my brother and his wife dragged me to the beach. They wanted to fight and get some air at the same time. They made up as usual. And where am I? Getting sand in my shoes. Liz, I'd like you to meet Burt Hanson Pleased, I'm sure. Excuse me... but I've got sand... ...everywhere! Who's the character? Liz Eckhart. She's the manager. She's always dress for Halloween in the middle of summer? That's one of her most conservative outfits. I'll tell you about her clothes - they grow on you and so does she. This is it, huh? Mm-hm. This is it. Well, good night, Milly. Good night, Burt. And thanks. Wait a minute. Can't end a date without giving you a present. You're your own boss. Give yourself a half day off tomorrow. I can't when there's work to do. Give yourself a break and do me a favour. We can go to the beach, OK? That would be very nice. Great. I'll pick you up at noon. Goodbye, Milly. Oh! Be seeing you, Liz! Liz? Oh! I knew I should have gone on that diet! Hey, are you still in there? Er... I'll be out in a minute. What's keeping you? Erm... ...nothing. Hey. I thought you were gonna settle in there permanently. You're not going swimming in that? I sunburn very easily. Well, that's too bad. We, er... should've brought along a little suntan lotion. There we are. D'you like it? That's a nice suit. But then look who's in it. Come on. I'm glad we came on a day when there aren't too many people, aren't you? Hey, wait. In case any photographers want your picture for the papers... ...we don't want 'em to know it cost 12.95 when it looks like a million. What's the matter? Can't you swim? Sure. I was the first woman to swim the English Channel both ways. Underwater! Well, come on. Follow me, I'll teach you how. Come on! You all right? I think so. Why don't you breathe? That's the coward's way. Can't breathe and swim at the same time. People do. Gee, your shoulders are white. I'm not gonna bring you back here till you learn how to swim. It's too dangerous. I don't know what I'd do if anything ever happened to you. Oh, Milly. Good night. Burt, please don't come back any more. Well... - I mean it! Find a girl your own age. There must be plenty, it's a big city Listen... You're just lonesome. All right, I'm lonesome too. But we can't have loneliness push us together, it won't keep us together. Just loneliness reaching out for loneliness. That isn't it... - If you knew a girl your own age, you wouldn't want me. And that isn't fair So, please, before things get more complicated. Please, I mean it! Goodbye. Milly? Milly? Course you did right. You can't play tick-tack-toe with your feelings. An earthquake for the nervous system That's the problem of a sheltered life - you react like a schoolgirl. Then you make a fool of yourself and at my age that is not very becoming. You've got your whole future ahead of you. The only trouble with a future is it comes so much sooner than it used to. While you're at it, forget about Burt too. You say that as if you were reading my mind. Hi! Where you been? Early movie. No-one came by while I was out, did they? Nope. Not a soul. But how should I know? I got other things to do besides watch the traffic. Good night, Liz. Good night, Milly. See you in the morning. Their stuff isn't fresh. Those plums must be from somebody's backyard... ...and that French butcher's charging Paris prices. Huh? Did you leave your door unlocked? Hey, Milly! You forgot something! Boy, oh, boy! Did you forget! Hi, Milly! Hello, Burt. I... I found the door unlocked so I just came in and waited. I'm glad it was unlocked. You are? I wouldn't want you climbing through a window. Some of the neighbours might not understand. I think I'd attract less attention coming through the window... ...than coming through that squeaking door. You sure look nice, Milly. Oh, I stole this for you from your garden. Thank you - ...for the flower and the compliment. You always were a very gracious flower thief. You like the new record I got you? Very much. Isn't it strange how that lovely song reminds me of chicken salad? You know, we never did dance together. Thanks for the record. It's a long time since I saw you. One month. One whole month. 30 days. 31 days. You dance nice, Milly. So soft and warm. Did I say something wrong? No, it's just that we were forgetting to dance. Don't be so frightened. I'm not. Or if I am it's because I want to be. Not frightened... ...just a little careful. Cautious. Well, what's new with you? Eat, sleep, go to the movies. I got myself a job at Hathaway's department store. I was promoted to section manager. Burt, that's wonderful! Soon you'll be president. When did all this happen? Today. And what are you doing here? You should be out celebrating. I... I was hoping we could celebrate it together. Oh. I see. No, you don't... - Yes, I do. Burt, in some way you feel obligated to me... I know what I feel. ...because I was company for you when you were alone. With your newjob you needn't be alone. Milly, I met a lot of people... ...but I'm still lonely. Oh! I've been seeing people... Are you sure you're meeting live people? Well, they walk and they talk. Oh, Milly! I followed your advice. I went out on dates. I just found young people are too young for me. I took out a girl from ladies sportswear. She was secretly in love with Gregory Peck! We stared at his autograph for one whole evening. Can you picture that? Yes. I'm in love with Gregory Peck, too. I resent her interfering with my love. You can joke about it. Then I took out that girl from leather goods. It couldn't be that bad! She was a bubble-gum addict. A what? A bubble-gum addict. While we danced she popped gum in my ear. As long as she danced well. She was a jitterbug. I adore them. Jitterbugs can be fun. With bubble gum popping in your ear? It depends upon your sense of rhythm. Milly, don't laugh at me. I tried. There are more. Why go through it? I just didn't enjoy it, that's all? Ah, Milly! You wouldn't want me... ...to spend the rest of my life with a bubble-gum addict. Would you, Milly? Sorry I goofed. You goofed?! That's bop talk. Where did you pick that up? Why shouldn't I pick up an expression here and there? I'm not that old! Burt... ...what did you really come here for? To ask you to dinner and a movie. Dinner and a movie... Just to celebrate my newjob. OK? OK? OK. Oh! I almost forgot. I brought you a little gift. Some caviar. To eat with our popcorn. It's a new fad - caviar and popcorn. Movies really are better than ever. Hm. Looks more like a dog leg to me. Oh, drat it! Into the woods. Do you want a cigarette? Sure! All right. Thank you. Oh, I left the caviar at your place! We'll have to eat straight popcorn like everybody else. I love the smell Look, Milly, I've got something important to say right here and now. I didn't come back to go to a movie or have a date or eat dinner or anything like that. I came back because I can't get you off my mind. Night and day, week in, week out... Burt, didn't you ever know a girl your own age whom you liked? Yeah. It was a long time ago. It was high school stuff, that's all. I don't really remember her. I guess she was my girlfriend. Whatever happened to her? Who knows? I grew up and went my way and I guess she went hers. I wish you'd marry me. You've been gone a month, nothing has changed - ...I'm a month older and so are you, nothing else is different. Let me finish. You can walk out on me but hear me out. Milly, you're special. You're like no other girl I've ever known or expect to know. You're so special I've got to say it No, you don't, darling. You don't know how much it is really. Look, Milly... ...I want to spend the rest of my life with you. No more being alone... ...for you or for me. I've got to know tonight if you want me because if you don't I'll stop this dreaming. Burt, listen carefully. You're mixing up things. You're confusing a need for me with I don't know what... ...but that's all it is, Burt, just a need. You mustn't let it drive you into thinking impulsively or do anything impulsively. Look at it this way - we met, you were filled with a need... ...I had a need, but people don't... They shouldn't get married because they're lonely. It can also happen like this - two people meet each other and right away they know. I love you, Milly. Love me? I love you. And if you'll take a chance... I mean... ...will you take the chance? You don't have to answer that. You wanna see the rest of the movie? No. I just want to go home. Would you mind telling me why you turned me down? I'd honestly like to know. I tried to tell you once before. I'm older than you are. It's just too much that difference. It isn't because I don't like you. Of course I do. That's not the reason. Thanks for trying to be easy on me. Oh! It is the reason and the only reason! It just couldn't work. I've got nerve asking you to spend your life with me! Burt Hanson. Big deal! Big nothing. Well, this is it, huh? Burt! Burt! Can a girl change her mind? Oh, Milly! Don't make it so rough on a guy! No, never! Never again, I promise! Let's get married right away. We'll rent a car, we'll drive to Mexico... ...we'll be married before you have a chance to change your mind. I'll pick you up at eight. OK? OK. And I hope you'll never... ...ever be sorry. I won't be. I hope you won't be but I never will be. They're beautiful! There. Do you think it's really legal? All I did was say "Si." I didn't say "I do" once. You want to say "I do"? I just did. Meanwhile, do you think Liz can get along without us during our honeymoon week? Why did you tell the marriage-licence girl that you were born in Chicago? Because I was born there. I thought you once said Racine, Wisconsin? Born and raised in Racine. Not me. Must've been some other fella you wanted to hook. No, you're the one I wanted. I'm glad I hooked you. It makes me feel more and more satisfied. You know something? No. I don't know something. I don't want to go to work today. How about that orange juice? Orange juice! Breakfast now being served. Dining at the rear. Now I know why you married me - for my cooking. Your cooking? My cooking. That's a good one! Canned orange juice, instant coffee. I'm still trying to find canned buttered toast. I know what I really like about you - the way you sleep at night... ...with your nose all crinkled up. I could strangle you the way you pull the covers off me. I look at you each morning, I always think of reasons not to go to work. I wouldn't want to impede the progress of my future assistant buyer You're impeding pretty good! Happy anniversary! Weekiversary. The second one. All right. Happy second weekiversary. Burt, remember, don't bring home any more presents. Yes, Mrs Hanson. Of course, Mrs Hanson. Indeed, Mrs Hanson. You are Mrs Hanson! I mean it, Burt, about the presents. We've been celebrating all week - ...the candy dish, the portable bar - we won't have any money. I don't have to pay for it. It comes off my next paycheck. You have to pay for it next week. It's this week we celebrate. Here! He said he'd come by early but not this early. Come on! Anybody there? Come in, Colonel. Colonel Hillier, this is my husband Burt Hanson. I'm sorry I'm not dressed but I overslept. I heard the news from Mrs Eckhart. Congratulations and best wishes. Thank you. I suppose Mrs Wetherby will... Mrs Hanson, you'I be retiring soon? Not until I've typed your manuscript. Last installment. I don't believe in married women working. You seen much combat? Military intelligence. I was in the combat infantry. Spent two years with the 322nd. Goodbye. Yeah, we had 40 per cent casualties. Good day. I'd be glad to tell you about it. We got sent straight over from the States. We didn't even stop off... Come in, Liz. Yes? I'm looking for Burt Hanson. I'm Mrs Hanson. Can I help you? It's very important I see Burt. Is he in? Burt? No, he just left. Won't you come in? Thank you. I'm Virginia Hanson. Did Burt tell you we were married once? Oh, I see he didn't. I'm sorry. He should've told you. That's just like him. Did you say you were married to Burt? Up until about a month ago. That's when I got my final decree. But Burt doesn't know anything about that. You look sick. Won't you sit down, Mrs Han...? I'm a little confused. I know how you feel - I was married to him, too. You must be mistaken. After all, his name isn't an unusual one. Burt couldn't have changed too much. The younger man is my husband. The other man is Burt's father. Did he tell you anything about him? Only that he died several years ago. I can see he's very much alive. I bumped into him the other day. He's in Los Angeles on vacation... ...at the Chaplain Park Hotel, I think. Were you... Were you married in Racine? Why Racine? We're from Chicago. That's where we were married. Please bear with me. I... How long were you married? Four years. We went to school together. Everybody figured we were a natural, especially Burt's father. Yet you divorced him. What would you do? One day he just walked out. No goodbye, no nothing. Quit me, quit his job. We were frantic. In the meantime we heard about... ...some trouble he got into. Shoplifting. Just little things. They came and took back some presents he'd given me. We thought divorce was the only thing. You keep saying "we". Burt's father. He was going crazy. He made good to the stores. He's a wonderful man, Burt's father. He's very kind and considerate. Obviously you came here for a reason. Well, yes. I'd like Burt to sign some papers. His father gave us some income property as a wedding gift. I'd like Burt to sign a property settlement. I'm sure he won't mind. The envelope is addressed to me at some friends'. If you'd mail it. I'll see that he gets them. I hope there won't be any trouble. There won't be. Thank you again. I appreciate it. I'm sorry... Well... How did you find out about Burt and me? Well, we had one of those agencies. They traced him to the army... ...to Tijuana and then you. That's when we got the newspaper clipping. You just can't believe a word he says. That's what the police said. He just lies. Well, thanks again. I know how you must feel. You make me feel that I'm the one who has to ask for forgiveness. You're right. Put me in the debit side, my name in red ink. I admit it. I am a self-educated failure. I don't know what to do. To do or not to do, that is the question. I could spend every night reading the classics. But the problem is what to do about Burt. I'm ready to serve your best interests and help save Burt. What is it Burt needs to be saved from? I didn't mean to upset you. Well, I am upset. I'm his wife. If you're the father... Forgive me, Mr Hanson. No, no, no. You're right to protect him. You're more than a good wife. You're like a friend and a mother. I envy Burt, having you to help snap him out of it. But let's take my position. Like in the storybooks, we have a hero and a heroine. But I'm not your villain. What I am we'll let the gods decide. But I carry the memory of a nightmare. Burt is - or was - capable of lying about anything. I was sad to learn the real facts. That's why I'm so glad you say this is all part of the past. When did it... this lying, start? Does it matter? It might help to tell us why he lied. Must you have excuses for him? I'm looking for an explanation. To find out that your only son is a deadbeat, a liar, a thief! But he's not like that now. He has a good job and he's had a promotion. Says he has. - If he says he has, th...! If it makes you feel better to think that... Have you been to the store? Have you seen him? Look... I'd like to believe he's everything you say he is but... My son is no good. That's his past record. I put trust in such records. He was... ...he still might be a lost soul. If he is... no-one is going to save him. Not anyone. Still you have faith in him. Someone should. You've been very kind to let me come talk to you. Well, I... I hope to see you again while I'm here. Burt will want to see you. If that's what he wants, I want it too. It's a father's duty to be concerned about his son. But what he ought to do, I think, is go to a hospital. You haven't heard one word I've said. We'll see. But maybe you can give him enough help and strength yourself. I certainly hope so, for both of you. Yes. Yeah, send up some ice, too. 406. Did she give you a bad time, Mr Hanson? That's quite a hunk of woman Burt's got himself. I wonder how he managed to get her. She could also make things difficult. But she might be too shrewd for her own good. Isn't that her problem and his, not ours? Milly, dear? Hanson here! Hi, hon! Picked up so much stuff for dinner, I had to buy a shopping bag to carry it all. I stopped at that new delicatessen on Wilshire. What are your feelings about salami and garlic pickle? And some beer, too. Sit down and relax like the rich folk. Can I fix you a drink? No, thanks. Oh, uh, I brought you something. Do you remember saying you wouldn't? I got it just before we closed. No time for a giftwrap. I'll open it after dinner. What's wrong? Did I forget something? Why didn't you tell me? Can't you trust me? I'm entitled to the truth. What's happened? Were you at the store today? Yes, I was at the store today. Oh. I saw you behind the counter. That's very pretty. My own wife spying on me! But I had to! I had to find out. What disguise did you wear? A trusting wife? Did you tell the FBI your husband wasn't a manager but a tie salesman? Or did you photograph me at the scene of the crime...? Burt, stop it! It... It wasn't nice of me. It was an indecent thing for me to do. But I had to find out. Milly... Oh, Milly, I... No matter what you think of me, I love you and I wouldn't hurt you for anything. Burt, why did you have to pretend? I didn't marry you because I thought you'd be president of the store. All right, forget it. Forget it? What about all those presents? I wanted to be a thoughtful husband. Even if it meant stealing them? No, Milly. I signed for them. They wouldn't let you on your salary. You could be arrested! Don't you understand that? They've all got to go back - the portable bar, the radio. Everything. All right. All right. I'll take 'em back in the morning. And then everything'll be all right. We can forget about it, can't we, Milly? Can't we? Isn't there anything else you want to tell me? What is this, a third degree?! Burt, what about the past? What happened before you met me? I have no past. My life began the night I met you. I wish it were as easy as that. Virginia was here today. Virginia?! Why didn't you tell me you were married before? I'd forgotten about it. It isn't important. Isn't important - marriage, divorce? You can't forget about them! You didn't know Virginia had divorced you when you married me. You go around in a dream world remembering only what you want to! You're the only thing that's real to me. Nothing else matters. I'm your wife. You have a responsibility to our marriage. I have a right to know. Yes. I never... I never loved her like I love you. I'm glad, and I'm sure that's true. But you still have to tell me. Tell you what? Everything! Let me help decide what's right. Burt? Burt. Look, the present is made up of little bits of the past. You can't throw it out of your mind like something worthless. You must tell me. Please. She was my first girl, that's all, the one I told you about. After you got married, what happened? Did you go to work? It's ancient history! So I went to work instead of school. I needed money for an apartment. After we saved enough, we went out looking. Any more questions? Yes! There are more questions! Why did you never tell me? Our house was more a toy house than a real one. You sound as if you never even lived together! You want all the ugly details? There's nothing to tell! So I got an apartment. It had stairs from the living room to the bedroom. It just isn't important, Milly. That's why I never mentioned it. Don't you see? I... l-I guess I see. But wouldn't it be better to mention it now? Then we'll never talk about it again. Wouldn't it be easier that way? Easier for you and for me. Wouldn't it? All right, maybe we did get married but we were just kids. And then? And then? - And then what happened? I'm not sure. You're not sure about what? I... I did a crazy thing one day. I came home at noon to give her a surprise present... ...for our six-month wedding anniversary. She wasn't expecting me. I just wanted to surprise her. I figured... I don't know what I figured. I don't know. You don't know what? I can remember going up the stairs, but I can't remember coming down. What do you remember at the top of the stairs? Nothing at all. Was there someone with Virginia? No, no, no, Milly! All right, all right! Sorry! You're right. If there are things you don't want to talk about... ...don't even want to remember them, forget it. But, darling... ...why did you tell me your father was dead? My father?! I saw him today. He's out here on vacation. Well, I just felt he was dead. I still feel he's dead. What's everybody trying to do to me?! I told him how well you were doing... ...and that you'd see him tomorrow. I'll go with you. We'll be busy at the store taking inventory, and there are all those things you want me to take back. There'll be time to see your father. I'll meet you after work. Oh, Milly! I'll do anything you want... ...but please don't ask me to go to see him. You must! You must, for his sake as well as yours. Burt, look at me. Oh, darling! You can't keep pretending you haven't got a father. You do have one and he loves you very much. Did... Did you say he was alone? All alone at the Chapman Park Hotel. All right. I'll go if you want me to. I didn't mean to force you. If I sounded that way, I'm sorry. I'll go. If you want me to. I'd like to see Mr Hanson. Mr Hanson's suite is 406, but I think he's out by the pool - round to your left. Has Mr Hanson's son asked for him yet? No, not since I've come on. I see. Thank you. I still say you're getting heavy! I've lost ten pounds in two weeks. Come in! Is Mr Hanson in? He's expecting me. Suite 406. Thank you. Oh, miss. Weren't you asking about Mr Hanson's son? Yes. He just went up to his father's suite - 406. Burt, did you...? Milly... take me home... please. Burt dear, are you ready? Darling. I asked you if you were ready. Ready? I told you we were going for a walk. We could use the fresh air. Come on, darling, you haven't been out of the house for days. It'll be good for us to get out of the house for a change. I'll be right back. What do you want? To see Burt. I still haven't received those signed papers. Get away from here! But what about those papers? He can't see anybody. He's sick. When he's well enough I'll get him to sign the papers. Hello. Can I be of any help? Burt's sick, and if he sees you... Get out of here. I want to help. You sicken me! Aren't you being unreasonable? I haven't the heart left to be reasonable with you, Mr Hanson. You won't stop me from seeing Burt. Burt's sick? Yes. Sounds like a cheap trick. I won't have him disturbed. He's emotionally upset. Emotionally upset? He finally cracked up. I saw it coming. This demands immediate action to protect Virginia's rights. He must sign these papers, now! Right now, or I'll have him committed! Try to stop me and I'll have you put in jail and him declared incompetent Will you shut up?! - I want what's coming to Virginia! I'm tired of begging for what's rightfully mine. The place for him is an institution! Put him away in some hospital. Have some headshrinker work on him. He should be committed! You want me to commit him - ...put him away so he can never remind either of you of your horrible guilt! You and you committed the ugliest of all possible sins and drove him into the state he's in now. What kind of a woman are you to be satisfied with only half a man? He's a saner man than you are! He's decent and proud! Can you say the same for yourselves? Where's your decency? In what garbage dump? And where's yours, you tramp? - I don't have to listen to that! She's crazy! Staying with that weakling! You, his loving fraud of a father! And you, you slut! You're both so consumed with evil! Your filthy souls are too evil for hell itself! My attorney will take care of you! Have him put away where he belongs! You know, I, uh... I was just thinking. We might rent a car and drive down to the beach. Might be fun. Don't you think so? Course, we'll still take our walk. Burt, you're smiling. I thought of something. I've been sitting here for a long time trying to add things up... ...and now I know the whole score. I feel like I've been born again. Born again? You conniving tramp! They couldn't get anywhere with me, my father and Virginia... ...so they picked you as a partner! You're in a key spot! You'll talk me into anything and then all divide it three ways! Could you for one moment possibly think...? That property belonged to my mother and you're not going to get it! Not you or my father or Virginia! And especially not you! Because you I can stop personally! Burt, I wouldn't turn against you if it meant my life. You are everything I love. Trying to get away? You've made your bed. Nothing but lies, turning against me! You know what you deserve? That'll teach you. No more lies. I saw all three of you through the door, all lovey-dovey. I knew! Now, get up. Don't sit there looking innocent. I told you I knew. I knew it and now I know it! I know it! You're all against me! DON'T LOOK AT ME THAT WAY! Milly! Milly! Milly! Please! Forgive me! I couldn't help it. I was... I... I'll be all right. I'll be... all right. What was they talking about? Hook shot. Hey, buddy, watch the thumb. Yes, Liz. Hiya, Burt! Hey, Milly. Hi. What did the Doc say about your hand? It's almost healed. Good. And what'd he say about Burt? Nothing. They haven't met yet. But he's been coming to your place to fix up your hand. He's seen Burt, but they haven't really met. How's Mr Hanson? I thought he was sleeping. I'm not an expert, but I think he needs some specialised treatment. For two weeks I've been coming here- I'm grateful, Doctor, but I couldn't get away from my work. Yet when I've seen your husband, I don't think he's ever seen me. He's... very troubled. I hope you'll forgive me but I've discussed him, without mentioning any names... ...with Dr Couzzens - one of the best psychiatrists in the country. I've never had an occasion to know a psychiatrist and I don't want to. No-one ever wants to. But if you need one here's Couzzens' address. Call him when you wish. Thank you. I'd suggest soon. If that isn't better by Thursday, call me. Good night, Doctor. Good night, Mrs Hanson. Hey! How about some room service? All right, B... Come on, I'm lonely. My! You look so rested. Were you talking to somebody? The doctor. Did you nap well? Mmm-hmm. I'll get you a bowl of soup. Wait, Milly, I think you got something on your shirt. Where did that come from? You must have been practising. It's a funny thing - like that kiss. I can't remember when we did it last Seconds? Mmm-hmm. Well, I'll get you the soup. What happened to your hand? I tried to go in two different directions at once. Oh, yeah, I remember. Let me see your black eye. Oh, no! It's fascinating, but only to me. It changes colour every day. I'm not going to take the glasses off. There's something unladylike about a black eye on a woman. I'll get you your soup. Virginia, I want to give you a present. Virginia! Dad! You left the door open! You've left the door open! Burt! I don't wanna go down the stairs! SOMEBODY HELP ME! I DON'T UNDERSTAND! Burt, listen to me! I'll help you. I'll show you the way downstairs. Come with me. I'll show you the way, darling. I'll help you. I'll help, darling. You'll be all right. Darling! You'll be all right. You'll be all right. Oh, dear God! Dear God, help me! How quickly and how easily can he be cured? Quickly and easily? I have no licence for handing out miracles. He must be placed in a hospital where he'll get treatment. You want me to commit him, too. Make him a mental patient! I couldn't do such a horrible thing. He's like a child. Yes, like a child with his mother. But a child has to grow up. It's terrible enough leaving him alone for just a few minutes. You're asking me to commit him. He wouldn't want to live, knowing all his life he'd be known as a mental case! Mental disorder is just another illness. It won't go away if you ignore it, it'll get worse. I'm talking about his infantilism and all the other elements of a schizophrenic pattern. He's rejected the world around him. You say he's become unable to make a decision, he refuses to see anyone, ...his dependence on you - all these are common symptoms of this illness. If I gave him love and understanding, wouldn't that be sufficient? He's getting love and understanding. What he needs is expert medical treatment. He will be able to accept your love later. Right now, I see you going to pieces because of his illness. You're offering me very little choice. I'm offering you no choice. How can you expect me to be the one to hurt him? I expect you to have the necessary strength to act. It takes great love and mercy to commit a person... ...even into the hands of experts. I love him, I couldn't do that to him You can't go on like this. You're only helping to destroy him and yourself. He... he'd be all alone with strangers. You see, I'm the only one he trusts. If I've sounded harsh or unkind it's because you're resisting me. You mustn't, for your husband's sake and for your own. He's becoming a child again. As he disintegrates - You're deliberately telling me this to frighten me. Deliberately yes, but to advise you. Before you throw the ashtray at me - you don't have to decide right now. Watch his behaviour. If you see any truth in what I've said... don't wait too long. Doctor - how long would he be away? The therapy in a good sanitarium isn't always a long drawn-out affair But be prepared for his being away and confined for five or six months. I know I've upset you, but then... ...that isn't important, is it? You're not the patient. Or are you? I thought you'd get around to that. In your world, everyone's crazy. As I don't know everyone in my world I don't feel qualified to answer. I'm sorry. We're used to it. Look, you've told me all the terrible things that could happen. Is there any hope for Burt? Of course. We've been getting remarkable results. In most cases, complete recoveries. Patients who've had no contact with reality have become adjusted... ...and developed new emotional values enabling them to be - to live again. To live again? That's like being born again. It's quite like that. Let's say Burt is as sick as you make him out to be. Let's say that he does go to the sanitarium and that he's cured. Well, the question is... ...might he come out not... not needing me, not loving me? That is possible, isn't it? I can't be dogmatic. One thing, however, is obvious. He married you because of many needs interwoven with his neurosis. If you remove the neurosis you might also remove his feeling for you. He wouldn't have those needs. He shouldn't have those neurotic needs if he's well. Am I a neurotic need? What you're trying to tell me is... ...if Burt is cured I might lose him. The possibility exists. Would you rather keep Burt as your husband, let him become a psychotic ...and ruin your lives? Or have him return to a happy, normal life, even if it might mean losing him yourself? Do you really think any woman in love could answer that question? Burt, you've got to stop it. Burt... can you hear me? Dr Couzzens? This is... Mrs Hanson. This is nice and hot. Milly, you'd never leave me. Would you? Darling, I want you to remember one thing... ...and please try to remember it... ...I love you with all my heart. But you'd never leave me. Would you, Milly? Look, whatever happens... Milly! - Burt, you've got to trust me. Don't let them take me away. I'll be good, I'll do anything you say... I didn't do anything, I'm all right. Burt, it's for your good. Trust me, darling. Take it easy. - I didn't do anything wrong! I didn't do anything wrong! You did this! I'll get you! YOU! I'll get you! I'll cut your guts out! I love you. - I didn't do anything wrong! I won't listen. I'll get you! I didn't do anything wrong! I didn't do anything wrong! I didn't do anything wrong! 'Therapy in a good sanitarium isn't always a long, drawn out procedure... ...but be prepared for him being away and confined for five or six months' 'Five or six months. Five or six months.' "When you remove that neurosis you might also remove the feeling he has for you." 'Don't let them take me away.' 'You must trust me.' 'Please. Look, no, I'll be good.' 'It's for your own good.' 'Help me! ' Where you been? I've been waiting all day and half the night. I was walking. A fine time to be walking. It came. A letter from Burt. What's wrong? Milly, what's wrong? It isn't from Burt, it's from the sanitarium. Burt will be discharged next Friday. They asked that I come up to... bring him home. That's good! Ain't that good? Why me? Why should I go? They ought to know by now he doesn't want me, doesn't need me any more. It's not so definite. The question's still open. He never wrote me, never asked for me He's been sick. You've said it a thousand times. Give him a break. Now he's better, help him once more. Help him to do what? What should I do, go and act casual? "Hello, Burt darling. It's so good to see you again! You're looking well." Then what do I do? Beg him to come home? And when he says no, what do I do? Smile sadly and walk away into the sunset? You've got to go. It's not making it any easier torturing yourself. You're the only one who can find out how he feels. Nobody can help you. Why can't they? When do I get my turn? Everybody needs help, don't they? I need help, too. Maybe I don't want to find out how he feels. Being in love is never easy. The more in love you are, the less easy and more lonesome it gets. You're talking to an expert on being lonely. Remember? Burt's bound to be grateful. I don't want him back because he's grateful and obligated and I... I can't take being hurt any more. And how does your garden grow? Hi, Miss Evans. You look prettier every day. How do you do it in that cast-iron uniform? I need it to protect me from the eyes of certain patients. You're crazy. Who isn't? - That's right. Hey, I'm not. They may be but I'm not. What makes you so sure? I hear they're getting rid of me. What a thing to do to a perfectly normal guy, take him away from everything he's gotten used to. We're not running a hotel. We need the bed space. There are other nuts here? Please, some of my best friends are in joints like this. Anyway, you're getting your walking papers and diploma today. Now how does your garden grow? With silver bells and cockle shells and very pretty maids. It's routine to ask the nearest relative to come on graduation day. Don't bother to introduce us. Mrs Hanson and I've already met. Goodbye. Hello, Burt. I spoke to the head of the sanitarium He said you'd told Virginia and your father to stay out of your life, that they could have the signed papers. But I'm part of your past, too. You didn't say goodbye to me. You need this chance to cut yourself off from all things past, even me. I know you're angry with me for sending you here. It isn't very nice to be sent off to a sanitarium. It's unpleasant and cruel, very cruel But if you'd cut yourself and were bleeding... ...I would have done anything to stop the bleeding even if it was cruel. Please don't worry... the important thing is that you're well again. I told you once I wasn't good at small talk. And here I am making small talk. I guess I'm... I'm sorry, Burt, I'm just a little nervous about... I... I'm not feeling sorry for myself. You're free to make any choice you wish. I won't hold it against you. Not for very long. I've told myself life isn't one long honeymoon. People have to grow up and get happiness like real adults. About your clothes - ...just leave a forwarding address. Miss Evans is a pretty young girl. A nurse too. No Miss Bubble-Gummer. Or Miss Jitterbug. Or is she? Well, I guess that takes care of everything. So I'll wish you luck and say goodbye Milly... ...let me see your hand. My hand? The one I hurt with the typewriter. The scar's almost gone. You didn't even give me a chance to say hello. Did you want a chance? Hello, Milly. I think people are staring at us. Do you care? - No, let them. # Since you went away # The days grow long # And soon I'll hear # Old winter's song # But I'll miss you most of all, my darling # When autumn leaves start to fall #
