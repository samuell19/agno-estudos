Studio 3 presents Guys! Look over there! - Where? - There! Up there! Guys! Run! CHILDREN'S SICKNESSES A FEW WORDS ON TIME OR THE BIOGRAPHY OF A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY Come, I'll explain how clocks work. - Want to know? - Yes. Blinking takes around a second. When the big hand goes around once, an hour goes by. You were born six years ago on May 4th at 4 A.M. - That early? - Then you learned to walk. By the age of two, you could talk. Tomorrow, I'll wake you up at seven because it'll be the first of September, and I'll take you to school by eight. There, you'll learn everything worth learning. Son! I'm ready! We can go. Here's your bag. Hurry up, son. Come have breakfast first! Come on, eat! Drink your coffee, son! - Mama, dear, have you seen my glasses? - I haven't. - Have you seen my glasses? - No. My son. I think you're the prettiest like this. Where are you going? - To school. - Me too! - What are you eating? - Zizi candy. Did you know your dad is knock-kneed? He really is. - What about yours? - He's left-handed. - What about your mom? - We can't say bad things about Mama. Hi there! INTRODUCTION TO THE REALM OF WONDERS Come here, little girl, and those of you who are going to be first graders. Come now, run along, join the others! Very good. You with the bag on your head, come here too! Very good. Is everyone here? We aren't missing anyone? What's going on? What happened there? What are you doing? Come here, come. Oh, what's wrong? Why is this child crying? Hey, look at me. Quiet please, children. Everyone! Quiet, please. At school, you have to look forwards. Let's introduce ourselves now. My name is Judit and I'll be your teacher. I'd like you to introduce yourselves to each other and me. Let's start there, with you. Stand up, stand up from your seat. Péter Berényi. - Miklós Hernádi. - Tamás Hernádi. Laci Oláh. Jancsa Tata. Gergely Csipura. Gábor Rundhay. István Csendes. Lali Szekeres. Tell me, what did you learn in kindergarten? Where are you going, little rabbit? Ingyom-bingyom táliber tutáliber máliber, to the woods. Enough, enough, enough. Children, quiet, please. Quiet! Why don't the children stand up when someone comes in? It stinks in here. Why aren't the windows open? - I just closed them. - Come on. Now listen here. Tomorrow, everyone has to sit in the place they are sitting now, so remember your seats. Turn around and take a good look. at each other. Yes, good. Open your eyes, okay? Wider, wider. Just like that. Look here! Miss Teacher! Don't! - Good morning, excuse us... - Good morning. The whole family slept in. Good-bye. Good-bye. That's not true! My parents had a fight, ran away, and left me home with Grandma. My grandma is so old and she was slow like a snail. - Alright then, take a seat. - Miss Teacher! What is it? Miss Teacher, when can we finally go home? Show it, everyone. Stand up, class. There's a cross wind. Close the windows! Take a seat. - What are you doing? - Miss, Tata and Robi are making fun of me. What did they say? They keep calling me rolly-polly. It's not true! He's a real tattle-tale. Hey, you were the one teasing him and making fun of him! Alright, children, who knows which season we start school in? - Robi? - Fall. Yes, fall. And how do we know when it's fall? - It isn't snowing! - And how else? Rita? The leaves turn yellow. Good! If you children behave yourselves, we'll go for a walk in a forest and pick real fall leaves. Excuse me, Miss Teacher! Miss Teacher, I saw a forest fire on TV once. And how to smart little boys and girls stop forest fires from starting? Tomi? You blow it out. - And what season comes after fall? - Winter! Winter, very good. And how do we know it's winter? - It's cold! - Yes. And how do we protect ourselves from the cold? - We turn on the stove. - Yes, exactly. Does anyone know how we do that? Yes? You don't know? What about you? It looks like girls don't know how to do it. I'm sure the little boy in the corner knows. Go ahead, tell us! We put a bunch of paper in the stove and then a bunch of sticks on top of it and logs too, and if the logs start to burn we put in some coal. When the fire burns down, you have to close the stove, and if there's no fire, you have to sweep the chimney. - How do you know all this? - My dad works with stoves. And who may you be? How come you're here? Me? I don't know. I don't know anyone here. Not even Miss Teacher. I think I came to the wrong classroom. Alright, then. Pick up your stuff and go find your class. He got lost. Dumby! Dumby! - Hi! Aren't you coming? - Hi! I am. - I was looking for you all day. - I was put in a different class. - Why didn't you tell me? - I couldn't. Our teacher has the prettiest knees in the whole world. I'm going to marry her. You call that pretty? Come out! Look now! Did you guys do this? If you ever do this again I'll-- Wait for me, guys! - Hey buddy. - It's urgent! Come on, I bought tickets already. I have tickets and the film is great. Won't you come? I'm not going. - Won't you come, at least? - Buzz off. Hey there! - Come on, just do it! - What are you waiting for? Good afternoon! Have you seen a firetruck this big anywhere? - That was funny! - So funny! Let's blow her up, guys! Help, help! Run, you mutt! Look there! Run! Escape! Stop right there, you rascals! I'll break your bones if I catch you! - Listen here, you! - Why should I go back to my car? - You're drunk, go back! - Me? Me? While homeward bound I thought about The way, through every mile, In which to greet my mother, whom I missed for quite a while. What pleasing words to say to her? Dear words they need to be (...) (...) And in my mind the thoughts caroused, More pleasing every one (...) I leapt into the tiny room… She ran, she flew to me… (...) I clung to her without a word… Like fruit clings to the tree. HOMEWORK Hey there, buddy. What's up? Let's take the wardrobe and go. - Okay. - A bit to the left! DISCOVERIES IN THE WORLD OF COLORS Watch out! I'm here! I'll draw you something. - Do you know what this is? - Yes! It's the Sun. - And this? - It's the Moon. It's the Sun again. Now it's a sunflower. - And this? - It's a clown. -It's my friend. - And who are they? - You and me. But they look the same. You don't say. A YOUNG BOY'S TEMPTATION OR THE ADMIRATION OF TECHNOLOGY School isn't even that far. I can get there on my own. Hi! Hello! Hi! - I can see you! - So what if you can see me? But I'm in a hurry. Hurry all you want. You'll fail anyways. - Aren't you coming? - Yes, just my shoes are a bit tight. - Plus, I go to school in the afternoon. - Liar! So what? Hi, buddy. I hope you break your neck! My dad would do anything for a car but doesn't have one. - Even if it kills me, I'll still get one. - Will you take me with you? - If you'll shut up. - Hey! - What are you doing here? - None of your business! What are you doing? - Buzz off or I'll kick your brains out. - He doesn't even know what those are. Come, Zizi, a movie theater! Let's go look. Come on! I know what they're doing. - I know too. - They're making babies! There isn't much to it. Wow! This is cool. This is how I am with school. It sucks out all my energy. Miss Teacher, don't! Miss Teacher! Two times two is four. Three times two is six. Four times two is eight. Five times two is ten. This is my favorite street. - This is cool. - You like this junk? Of course! - I don't like them. - Good thing. Ta... ta... Ti ti ti ti ta. Ta... ta... Ti ti ta... Ta ta ti ti ti... I like this too. Who cares? Oh... school. There are female astronauts too. - Yeah, I think I've heard of that too. - Would you sit in it? - Of course. What about you? - I wouldn't. Come on, faster! Faster! Even faster! Very fast! Step on the gas. Faster! Hi guys! That's the stuff. - Did you know the Earth is round? - Your head's round. It's nine o'clock and you're still not coming to school? Come, you big oaf! Okay, I'm going, then. [children's choir singing] Good morning. Again. CHILDREN'S SICKNESSES The person inside has a contagious sickness Entering is forbidden! Mama! Mama! - Were you the one whistling? - Yes, because my throat is hoarse. - Did you see the fatso? - Yeah, nothing can bring him down. - He's not even a kid anymore. - That's what he gets. - Are you alone? - Uh-huh. - Want me to come over? - Sure. - They're going to catch me. - They went away because they're scared. - Why would they be scared? - Because they might catch it. - No, they can't! - Why? 'Cause they're old. What's up with you? Toothache? No, I just got smacked by my dad. Do they beat you too? Only when they're bored. - Let me help with your coat. - His fever is 38.8 degrees. - We're really worried about him. - Your bag, Professor. - Hello. - Good morning. Hello, little boy. Show me your tongue. - Here you go, sir. - Thank you. I told you, honey, go to your room. I don't understand. I don't. - Do they poke you with needles too? - I don't let them. It doesn't even hurt. I just scream for fun. - Does your skin itch too? - Of course. - Do you scratch it? - Duh. - What do you have? - I don't know, all sorts of sicknesses. - What about you guys? - My head hurts. - My foot. - My hair. - My tummy. - My back. - My liver. - My eyes. - My nose. - My throat! One day, we will go away and stay no matter what you say! One day, we will go away and stay no matter what you say! CHILDREN'S GAMES Hello! Help me, guys! Hey! Look here, you guys! Birth-day. - Anyone? - Birthday! Very good, you may sit down. Next one. Zsó-fi is al-rea-dy se-ven years old. What did we read now? Tell us. Stand up. - Zsófi is already seven years old. - Very good, you may sit down. Next. Mo-ther baked a cake to ce-leb-rate. Rita? - Mother baked a cake to celebrate. - Very good. Fa-ther brought some flo-wers. The chil-dren ga-thered a-round. Miss Teacher, I'm getting a little brother or sister, but I'll hate it and throw it out the window. - Guess what I dreamed. - What? That I turned seven today. A JOURNEY THROUGH SOCIAL LIFE This is my family. Papa, Mama, my granny, my older cousin, my uncle, my aunt, Mama's best friend and her daughter, who's in my class. Papa was late for supper again today. - Excuse me. - He really loves me, but he's unreliable. We take each other seriously- we are the men of the family. The relative really I love is my older cousin. She's the prettiest girl in the whole world and a model at a fashion boutique. All the men are totally in love with her, but she's going to marry me because she loves me the most and I love her too. I can't stand Mama's best friend. I can't decide if she's here to visit Mama or Papa, and she always brings her daughter who I can't even look at. And this is my Mama. You've only seen her from afar until now. Nowadays all she does is sit and smile. Sometimes, she crochets things, but she's impatient. The clothes always end up too small. I love her even like this, because she's my Mama. I used to find her pretty, but she's gotten fat recently. Thank you very much. My Granny lives with us. She made our supper. At night, she cries and prays a lot, but it doesn't bother me when I study. My uncle's wife is here too, but you can barely notice her. Not like my uncle! He used to be a wrestling champion, but he's too old now. I hate him because he always wants to teach me new wrestling moves. I'm already worried what will happen after he's finished supper. Even though I tell him I won't be a wrestler or soldier, he just laughs and winks at me. Oh God, it's starting. Come on, big boy, I'll teach you a new move. - Go along, now. - Dad, please don't! - Please. - Your uncle will teach you. Come on, come on! Where are you going? Come out. Come quickly! - Careful! - Come, now. Come. Heave-ho! Leave me alone! Put me down! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! - Mama, are you crazy? - What should I do? Stop, you ox. Dad, help me! Coward, coward! Come at me, come. Isn't he cute? He really likes the kid. Help! Help! Gotta go by the rules, alright? Come! Come, let's have a proper match. Like this! Attack! By the rules. Stop it already. I can't deal with this kid! You'll see, I'll have everyone on the ground in minutes. Look here, you snot-nosed brat. Where are you? - Where are you hiding? - Stand up for yourself! Where are you hiding? - Come on out! - Wow, you're so strong! - Where did this kid disappear to? - Come on out! - Dear, please put on your coat-- - Leave me alone with that coat! He's there, under the table! - Come here! - Pista dear, please stop! Children, what did this man do-- Now I've caught all of you, right? Yup, except one! - Let the kid be. - I've had enough! Come on! Mama. - Who's that? - My uncle. - What are you doing? - Putting him behind bars. That's where he belongs anyway. Drive a bit slower, please. This is how I like to drive. I told you we shouldn't have brought the kids. Stop it already! But she's dumb. - Voila. - Wait here, I'll be back in a second. - Excuse me, sir. Here are the papers. - Here. Good morning! - Get out of here. - What are you doing here? Go back in the car right now! - Here, sir, the papers. - There. What is this? HURRAY FOR FREEDOM! Hey! Just go, you idiot! They'll notice you! Go where? They're everywhere? - Don't go, come back! - Tell me, what should I do? Oh no! Please. You can let him out. Ah, freedom! Wow, you haven't changed a bit! Right? - Leave me alone! - Come, come quickly. Leave me alone! He'll be back in there some day. I bet he'll be back. Look, buddy! Your uncle's here. Ten equals... Ten equals nine plus one, one plus nine, eight plus two, two plus eight, seven plus three, three plus seven, six plus four, four plus six and five plus five. If you aren't paying attention, stand up. You, yes, you! Stand up and stop making faces. Come to the blackboard and solve this problem. What is it? Go. I'm sure he knows the solution, that's why he isn't paying attention. There. Show everyone here what you know. Everyone, write down the problem in your notes. Psst! How much is it? You think I didn't here that? Write it down too. Everyone write it down, didn't you hear? Write down the problem he's solving. What are you doing? Stop erasing, you hear? What are you doing? Why aren't you paying attention? Where's your notebook? Look here! Look up, little boy! Miss Teacher, Miss Teacher! Don't raise your hand unless I call on you and leave your desk-mate alone. Hey! Stop fighting. Don't do it again! You'll stay dumb, you won't learn anything. The whole class will fail. And why is she crying? -Go away, you hear me? - I'll tell on you to my mom! - Stop it, don't talk to her. She doesn't deserve people talking to her. She's always crying. I do everything for you kids, but you won't learn because you're evil. Why won't you study? God must hate me for giving me this class. What do you want? Miss Teacher, I have to go pee. Mom! Mama. I'm hungry. - Find Granny. - She isn't home. They won't even feed me anymore. - Are you alone again? - Uh-huh. I'm bored to death. I'll end up having to go to church with Granny or to court with Dad. If only I could go with my cousin... Tsk, tsk. - Let's run away. - They'll find us anyway. - I'm really sick of school. - Me too. I think my dad never went to school. - It was better before. - Now, now. - Good evening. - Good evening. There's no one home. We're looking for your dad. - He isn't home. - Did he leave the money here? What money? - The money he owes us. - He didn't leave anything here. We keep working and working and get nothing? Tell your dad we've looked for him five times. We'll come again tomorrow. And where are your paper hats? Stop joking around, buddy. Come, let's go. We're never getting paid. Conversation between Father and Son Dad, I want to say something. Sure, son. Tell me. They were here for the money again. Oh, I forgot about that. If they come again, you'll answer the door. And tell them we aren't home, we're traveling. - And we left you home alone. - Give them the money instead. Look, son, you're old enough to understand. I don't have any money now. What I had, I gave to your uncle. Why not the painters? Because he got into trouble and would've stayed in prison otherwise. Even better! At least he'd stop fighting. Son, at times like this, we stick together. The whole family must help. Because we love your uncle. Because people love their relatives. That's not true. - Why, don't you love him? - No! We have to help, my boy. And you love your uncle. He loves you very much too. I'll defend your uncle in court so they don't take him to jail. Don't worry, there won't be any problems. Because he didn't do anything. Then why does he need defending? That's what your grandma says and that's what I'll say too. Last time, you said Mama was fat too, even though she's just pregnant. Oh, I was just saying that. Look, son, there are a lot of things that are still hard to talk to you about. But if you'll be a good and honest boy from now on... But if you're obstinate and keep talking nonsense, I'll spank you. - Then I'll tell on you to Mama! - Tell what? About Juca, Mama's best friend. The things you come up with... How can you say that? I only walk her home late at night because she lives far and is afraid. You'd be afraid too. Then why was she rubbing into you? She was just holding my arm because her new shoes hurt her feet. - Mama's shoes. - Your mother can't wear high heels now. Look, son. We can't bother your mother right now. She's emotional, nervous and has moved to the other room. Screw this world. Where are you going? Wait for me, I'm coming too! Wait for me! Wait for me, I'm coming! Wait for me, I'm coming! Go away. - Where are you going? - Somewhere. Where? Hi, guys! Where are you going? - Somewhere. - Hello! - Where are we going? - Guys, where are you going? Wait for me, I'm coming! - Why aren't you waiting? - Because we don't need girls. - You can't stop me, I'm coming too. - No you aren't! - Where are you going? - Somewhere. Somewhere! - Good evening. Where are you going? - Somewhere! Oh, that's a piece of shit. Run! - Where are you going? - None of your business. Somewhere. I think I won't marry my cousin after all. - When I grow up, I'll never get married. - Not even to me? Look, I'll be this ugly. Sol, la, sol... Off tune! Can't you hear? You're playing the wrong note. Careful, careful! You're playing the wrong note. Slower! You, you be careful; you're too fast. Slower, slower! Play at the same time. Put your recorder in the right place. POUR HOT WATER ON THE BALD ONE! - Dad, let's visit Mama first. - Wait a minute, I'll go buy a newspaper. I hate this about him. Cashier, 360! Good-bye, dear guest. He's the type to become a "home friend". - Good day. - Greetings, hello. - Tamás, is this seat free? - Sorry, your nephew was here first. - Where is he? - There. It's your turn, buddy! Shhhh! Come! Hello, buddy. We'll settle this, once and for all! Come, sit. - Make him bald! Bad! - Let me go! Bald! Bald! Pour hot water on the bald one! Mama! - Don't be scared, where are you going? - Stop running! Where is this kid? - Where is the kid? - Good evening, please come inside. - Dear! - Where is he? - Close in on him! - Can you see him? - There! - Where's he going? Don't let him get away!

Help, guys! Let's help him! Come on, guys! After him, guys! Get him, guys! - He's here! We've got him! - Leave me alone already! - Let me be! - Now! Heave-ho! - What's going on here? - Nothing out of ordinary. - Good God, what happened? - Excuse me, did someone commit suicide? Excuse me, what happened? - Someone fell in. - Nothing, just an accident. Zizi. I was just kidding. Catch him! Hey! Hey! After him! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him... Stop! Stop! Please, stop!

The very thought fills us with pride... that we've managed to turn the foolish, unruly children who came to our school... into honest, exemplary adults... like their parents and teachers.
