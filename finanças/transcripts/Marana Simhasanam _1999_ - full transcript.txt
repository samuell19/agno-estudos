I'm worried about our boy. It's taken more days than expected to plant, Krishnan. It will be done tomorrow, Master. Here it is. For both of you. 50g of tea. 50g chilli powder, 1kg rice. 2 rupees of papads. 50ml oil... 1l kerosene... 39.50 rupees. Don't spoil him! Oh, my Lord The beautiful head that you cover with flowers and oils That wants to defy the world In a few days becomes a skull Oh, my Lord! What a contrast! What will we do after finishing work? How long will we have to starve? Just think of our boy starving! I will find something. Catch him... thief! Thief! Catch him... thief! Oh, beauty! Our powerful master known in the seven regions will lead you in your country and will be your wife Our powerful master will lead you on the earth Don't worry little girl, don't fear We will be there and will watch over you But you will have to forget your prejudices Don't worry little girl, don't fear We will be there and will watch over you Please spare him, he's innocent. please... Don't worry little girl, don't fear What a fate! He is a thief, he stole something yesterday. I hope they won't hurt him. No, they won't. How will his wife and son survive? Don't be sad. Come on, we have to bail him out. I am helpless, our Lord won't pay any attention. You should try. Poor Krishnan! The police have charged him with additional offences. I could have saved him. It was bad timing. The election is coming and they haven't found Karunakaran's killer yet. The police may fake Krishnan as the killer. You should do one thing, go to Viswan, maybe he can help you. I feel sorry him. Washington: USA has warned the Serbs that they will face reprisals unless they allow the War Tribunal and UN peace keeping troops into Kosovo to enquire about the massacre of the Albanians. NATO has agreed to the air force attack on Serbian centers in Kosovo. But the US ambassador told the press that they are delaying the attack in the hope of finding a political solution. Arial attacks are still possible, declared NATO Secretary General, Javier Solano. Poor woman, Krishnan hasn't got bail. If it had been a simple murder or a knife fight it would have been easy to resolve. Don't worry sister, we will do our best. Dear villagers... everyone is requested to vote Mr. Chathunni is the only true leader in this democratic Kerala All are requested to vote for him. All are requested to vote for the axe symbol. Elect Mr. Chathunni. Vote for him. Vote for him who fought for us at the assembly. All labours are invited to the protest against the arrest of comrade Krishnan that will be held in our town square at 4pm today. Dear villagers and labourers, you are all invited to the protest against the arrest of comrade Krishnan, that will be held in our town square at 4pm. Our labourers are becoming the victims of this fascist police activity. Fake charges against comrade Krishnan is a recent example. We have a prestigious history of fighting against the British people. So what I'm asking is, do we need to bend our knees to some fascist police officers? What happened in China in 1917? What happened in France? Remember one thing, all of you are peasants, labourers. We won't let them exploit us! We have to put up a fight against the Police. If the charges against comrade Krishnan aren't dropped, if he isn't immediately freed, prepare yourself for a long struggle. Long live the revolution! He's innocent, he wouldn't hurt a fly, so how could he commit a murder? There must be a political agenda. God, please save him! I can't stand seeing this. What are you thinking? It's night... get some sleep. What about my son? How is he? Why are you asking me? Don't feel bad. Think of a woman, the landowner's wife, instead of worrying about your family. You don't have much time left. Try to relax at least. Dear comrades and villagers... use your precious vote for comrade Chakrapani and the plough symbol. to have a bright political future. I ask you to support him and vote for him. Dear comrades and villagers... use your precious vote for comrade Chakrapani to have a bright political future. The minister declared that it will be a new step to the developing face of our country in the 21st century, and it will be done with the help of US technology. The central government had agreed to issue one electric chair per state. Is that true? - Here it is, look. Electric Chair a.k.a Throne of Death It looks beautiful! Must be expensive! - It's imported from America. It helps to give a painless death. It's so easy it can operate with a simple switch. Poor Krishnan, he'll be the first person to sit in the Electric chair. We have put forward our demand that comrade Krishnan must have a chance to sit in this electric chair in order to have a peaceful death. To notify our demand to central government comrade Kumaran has decided to go on an indefinite hunger strike in front of our communist party office. We are inviting all the villagers to the fasting ceremony. O martyr's columns O martyr's columns Here crowds of people adorn you with The red garlands of inspiring struggles Snow capped mountains, raised flags, the ocean's roar O martyr's columns AN EASY DEATH FOR KRISHNAN In the Ganga where epochs swim, lotuses bloom News prepared by Krishnakumar: The ministry has decided to replace the conventional hanging method, with the imported electric chair from USA. Comrade Krishnan will be the first person to sit in the Electric chair from Kerala. The minister personally requested to comrade Kumaran, that he must stop his fasting now. Comrade Krishnan is not only a courageous martyr but also a Mahatma. He has suffered much during his life. We must allow him to benefit from modern technology, to fullfill his painless death. We must congratulate comrade Chirutha, wife of Krishnan, for giving aid without respite throughout this strike. I welcome comrade Chirutha to the stage, to officially declare the end of this fasting. Dear comrades and villagers, our courageous ideal woman, comrade Chirutha, is following this rally. Please join and show your support..

That is good, I was told our government will offer his family a new house. We got electricity yesterday and water supply also. There will be a new bridge here soon. Krishnan is innocent and poor. We are sad that he is going to die, but we are happy that he will be dying peacefully in that chair. You must be happy. Can I get something to smoke? A local cigarette will be enough. It is our good fortune, I am so happy.

With this new tool more people will know an easy death. With the help of the World Bank the government has launched a new program to open for all access to an easy death. At the finalisation of this is project each village will be equipped with a "throne of death". Those who require an easy death will be able to use it. I invite our respected Minister to inaugurate this project. Brothers and sisters... I am so happy that the name of your little village will be written in History... in letters of gold. I envy comrade Krishnan because he is getting a peaceful, painless death. Our nation is advancing in giant steps towards progress. I also feel so happy to be here even in my busy election schedule and being a part of this historic event. Greetings to all, victory to India. Comrade Krishnan (martyr) The moment we have been waiting for has finally arrived. Our dearest comrade Krishnan will within a couple of minutes die a happy death. He is perfectly well, Sir. The common man Krishnan has now became a martyr. His body was kept in the party office for people to pay tribute. After three days he was cremated on a sandalwood pyre. His ashes were scattered into the holy rivers. Today, many things are done in his name. His biography is now a part of the school curriculum. A film about his life has even commenced production. Krishnan has became a legend. With the aura of a martyr, Krishnan remains always in our memory. Comrade Krishnan (born: 1947 - died: 1998) Long live the Revolution (hope you all enjoyed the film and subtitle) Greetings from Kerala Subtitles By : RFORRUDY
