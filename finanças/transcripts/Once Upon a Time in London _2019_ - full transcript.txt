Early 1930s, fascism is on the rise, and organised crime is born in England. Two gangs, the Italian Sabinis and the English White family, join forces to consolidate their control of London's. West End and its murky underworld. In different parts of town, two as-yet unknowns, Jack Spot Comer and Billy Hill, are starting to make a name for themselves. This city has never looked so dangerous. This Sunday, that pernicious bastard, Oswald Mosley, will bring his British Union of Fascists through the East End! Through our East End, we're not gonna let him, are we? - No! - No! So, let me ask you a question. Who here will join me in protecting our homes, our families, our livelihood against that treacherous hate mongering scum? Meet Jack Spot Comer. Sm all part Jewish social crusader, big part agnostic thug. He's cleaning up in his local man of Vl/hitechapel, and the East End generally. Nothing's going to stop him becoming a serious player. Not even Mosley and his fascists. Mr. Comer. Just as you said. The top third filled with lead. I hope you smash those Blackshirts' brains in. Very good, Mr. Felson. Very good. For the charge of grievous bodily harm, inciting public unrest, and attacking not one, but several officers of the law, I hereby sentence you to six months hard labour. Wes screed“. On your toes, Bear! This is Billy Hill, a North London boy, but he don't mind Where his work takes him. A prolific burglar and a deft thief. Ambition is definitely not something he's short of. Thank you, Mrs. Bennett. Wes screed“. Alright, next. Mr. Saki“, Mr. Mike. Harry. It's Mr. White to you. There's only one Mr. White here and that's your father. Sit down, Harry. I said, sit down. Don't make me tell you twice. And you can Wipe that smirk off your face, you dirty little toerag. There's an hierarchy around here, son, don't you forget it. Apologise to Mr. White. Apologies, Mr. White, nothing disrespectful meant. Prick. That's enough! Apologies, Mr. Sabini. You're becoming quite a regular round here, ain't ya, son? Word on the street is, you knocked off that samejewellers in Hatton Gardens twice in one week. You fancy yourself a bit, do ya, Billy? Just got a sense ofhumour, that's all. Yeah, well that's funny. What won't be funny is if you make me laugh today with the size of your spoils. From What I gather, I need at least 50 quid. I ain't got 50. Here's 80. Good boy. Very good boy. Hello, Billy. Hello, Aggie. Wes screed“. It's the third time we've seen this and we still don't know how it ends. And it's my favourite. It's my favourite, too. Hey, Jack, good to see ya. How you doing? Hey, Jack, welcome back. - I'll get you a pint. - Yeah. - How you doing? - Good to see ya. Moisha. - Welcome home, how are ya? - Good. Sonny. Mr. Comer. The name's Mulley. Barks Mum. I own four Spielers in Soho and have vested interests in every racecourse south of Cheltenham. I'm not a gangster, Mr Comer, I'm not even a criminal, but What I do is not entirely legal, and for that reason, I sometimes get some lowlife and some scum that frequent the property. Some of them are quite pleasant and fun, but some of them are not. I'm looking for an employee who can handle the latter. In no uncertain terms, I'll pay you a decent sum to take care of that and as long as you don't kill anyone, the bobbies will stay off your back, 'cause I'll pay them a decent sum, too. I'm not looking for a bargain, Mr Comer, or someone who gets too big for their boots. I'm afair man and I expect you to do What I ask, and I expect you to do it Without any trouble. Now, if you can do this, we'll get on handsomely. If you can't, I shall thank you for your time, and I shall find someone else. Alright, who invented copper Wire? Who? Two kikes fighting over a farthing. Why do Jews get circumcised? Why is that? 'Cause Jew birds won't touch nothing, unless there's 20% off! Comedian, are ya? What's the definition of a Jewish dilemma? Free pork. I got tonnes of these. This is one of my favourites. What happens when a Jew walks into the wall with an erection? Mat? He breaks his nose. Got another one, a Jew boy walks into his dad and says, "Give me 20 quid." Oh, useless bloody horse! That was very passionate. Mom says you're a bad influence on me. V\fish I was a worse influence on ya. - So do I. - Do ya? Well, yeah. But don't wanna get a bad name for myself, do I? Aggie Hill. What'd you think of that? - Now you're teasing me. - No, I ain't. You wouldn't get a bad name for yourself then, would ya? I don't like it when you tease me. I'm not teasing. What do you think? Let's try Win some money, come on. That's my girl. Come on, ladies and gentlemen, come on! 10 pound, V\fin Rider, five to one! Low Ranger at four to one, 'aNm Rider at five to one. Get out, out! Out. Mr May? I know you're in there. You come out now and I won't hurt ya. You can't go around abusing Mr Mulley's pitch like that. Don't make me do this, Mr May. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, drop the knife, pal. Stand up. Slowly. Only a mug would shoot someone, 'cause if you kill 'em, that's the death penalty. Understand? Each time you on about the Whites or the Sabinis, and trust me, you do, I ain't stupid, so once I worked that one out, I knew I was just gonna get a beating. Jack. Elephant Dave's here. Alright, Dave? Jack. Just let me finish up and I'll be right with ya. Right you are. Thank you for coming, and thank you for sharing my enthusiasm for the London County and Westminster job, which I believe will be our biggest to date. Most of you know each other, but as we've got a few new faces and as is customary, I'm gonna start by making a few introductions. Elephant Dave, he's our resident cat burglar. He's already done his job, hence his replica key to the front door. Billy Sparks and Mark Bear, they're alarm specialists. Mr Russell fit the alarm system. Our confidence man on the inside as such. Big Bob, Grinning Mike and EasyAlan will break the safes, hopefully in minutes. Jaguar Ken, Motor Mike, and North Street Ronnie will nick our getaway vehicles and drive us all to safety. We sure it was Spot? I've had it from two reliable faces, it was him. V\filliam Hill, your frequency in these courts is a national disgrace, and seeing as you are unwilling to name your accomplices, I see no choice but to sentence you to two years penal servitude.

Blackout, rationing, most every bobby here called up to serve. Who knew wartime would be so good for business. Very true. It's a brave new world out there Mr Mulley, Without the Sabinis, well, the Sabinis would have ruled this the Whites are, and if it ain't me, it'll be someone else. And if it's someone else, it'll be more aggravation for me. Sol might as well just be the one to do it in the first place. Well Jack my old son. Whatever you have to do, you have to do.

Dear Mr Comer, my name is Billy Hill and I come out of Camden originally but I'm writing this letter to you from Wandsworth nick. I won't lie, it's not the first time I've been inside but it will definitely be the last. And believe you me, I'm a man of my word. I come from a large family where blagging is in our blood. And so is honour, loyalty and respect and a need for constant jugglin'. I'm doubting you know who I am. I very well know who you are, as I've been a frequenter at Botos for quite some time now. I especially like the house band you introduced after you took over from the Whites. Anyway, I've been doin' a lot of thinking since I've been inside and I know you Sonny and Moishas' as your loyal and trusted men. I've even spoken to Moisha a few times and he's as solid as they come but, I'd like to offer you my services Mr Comer and I don't say this lightly as I've never wanted to work for anyone before. You're different though, you're smart, you're forward-thinking and you're fearless and I'd like to think our combined skills can be a dynamic and lethal combination. If you're at all interested in finding out more than What I can put down on paper, you know Where I am and I hope to hear from you soon. Yours sincerely, Billy Hill. Hello Jessie, how are you?

Word from the commissioner is the violence is getting out of hand. It's not good for public moral, and it reflects badly on the force, hence forth, anything that encourages violence is also bad for public morale and reflects badly on us. Specifically your Spielers and every other illegal activity you run. What are you saying exactly? What I'm saying, exactly, is if we're going to go on turning a blind eye, we're gonna need a bit more encouragement from now on. Let's say we'll be having to turn two blind eyes every week, not just one. Where the fuck is all my money? Our money you mean. We got more outgoings and less incomings than we've ever had.

Who's the king of the underworld? Jack Spot's the king of the underworld. Jack Spot, Jack Spot. A lot of people are saying, the Eastcastle street robbery was your doing Billy. Well, obviously that's not something I can comment on Duncan. But What I will say is this, Whoever did that job was a genius. Acriminal genius. It was daring, it was slick, nobody got properly hurt which is important. Indeed. And it was the biggest haul in British history. Pure genius. And Where were you on the night? Of course I have an alibi. I was in one of my clubs with my girl. Lots of Witnesses. Cleared it all up with the Bobbies. Can't say too much though, mom's the word. How many Spielers do you run now?

Jesus mother Mary of God. I got a put a stop to this. Are you carrying? Hello officers. I'm here to see Mr Comer. No visitors I'm afraid Sir. You know who I am? We know who you are Sir. Mr Billy Hill. What an unexpected pleasure. It's a shame you can't all act like adults rather than a bunch of trumped up school boys. At one point he really did rather admire you, you know? Feeling's mutual Rita. And can you please point out the man who attacked you Mr Dimes. He's not here. Silence means silence in court. Or you'll be held in contempt. Mr Comer, can you please identify the man who attacked you on Frith street. No, I don't see him. IWill not have my court turned into a circus. Where is everything? I had to sell it. Mat? Barristers aren't good Samaritans Jack. Bloody thieves is What they are. We got anything coming in? Dimes runs the racetracks, Billy runs everything else. What's this? It's a savings book. You never would listen to me so I've been putting money in for the last five years or so now. You're gonna be alright Jack. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all very much for coming this evening. It really is a great honour you've decided to spend your evening with me. Now, before I begin to talk about my short, but eventful life. I'd like to say a few thank yous. I'd like to thank the journalist Duncan Webb, for helping me write this. I'd like to thank my beautiful girlfriend Gypsy, for inspiring me to write this, give me a kiss. And I'd like to thank my Wife. Oi, you heard right, I'd like to thank my Wife Aggie for allowing me to write this. We're no longer together, but she's a great girl and I'm happy to say, we're still good friends. To you Mrs H. Oh, excuse me. Thank you. Oh, got a note from an old acquaintance here. I hope it goes well tonight. I'm very sorry I couldn't make it. In a spot of bother, Jack. Enjoy your evening. Good boy. I don't know if Andrew Koligi's worth it. I could hang if we got found out. We'll work with What Jack said, he'd be sittin' in the Thames and we'll be at church having Sunday roast. We nick a car, wear some masks, no Witnesses, it's easy money. Who killed Billy Hill? Can see it in all the papers. Who pulled thetrigger? We all will. We shot and killed him. Did you have to Frankie? Well they were gonna kill ya. They're just kids. Killer's a killer Bill. Anyway I was just having a laugh with these boys, teach them a few lessons in life. No harm done, all vital organs intact and all that. And? It was Spotty. Times have changed Jack. The freeholder, they don't need the aggravation anymore. And to be honest I can't say that I blame them. It's all I got Mr Mulley. V\fithout this, I've got nothing. I been meaning to sort out my properties for awhile now. Just had other priorities. Being a landlord is not to everyone's taste, running a pub, well it's hard work. It's nothing that you ain't used to Jack. It's a lovely five bedroom flat upstairs, rent free, if you want it, it's yours. This is a lifeline Mr Mulley, thank you so much. We'll take it. You're welcome Rita. Jack. Three, and six. Charles thought you were Jack Bosby, your bloke left a While ago. New bloke said he'd never heard of you. Sorry Jack. What do you want Billy? Came to visit you in hospital the first time, wanting to make sure you was alright, you know, in spite of everything, I wouldn't be Where I am Without you. Met your Wife and she said something interesting. Said we should stop acting like schoolboys. Let's stop trying to hurt each other Jack. It's unbecoming. Let's call a truce. I've heard you might be opening a pub soon. I think that's a good idea. I'll put the word out on the street, your place is a neutral zone. I'll have a word with Albert and Frankie and square it all off. Think you're the big boss now don't ya? What do you want me to do in return? What you think? What is this stupid bloody thing you live by? Honour amongst thieves, a code of silence, well you're not a thief anymore, you're not a gangster, you're a husband and an unemployed father-to-be. And those men are nothing more than pathetic bullies. Pathetic bullies who beat up a defenceless and pregnant woman and they tried to murder you. Why would you ever want to protect them? They're scum. They hate you. They don't deserve the respect you show them. And they certainly won't be getting any from me. Can you identify the men who attacked you and your husband Mrs Comer? Yes they're over there. Order. Your disdain for human life, and your constant disregard for What makes these streets safe, for the law-abiding citizen, I sentence you both to seven years in jail. Megs, Megs, Megs. Here we go. Oi! Fellas, stop it. Get off him, get off him. You gonna finish your drink Ron? I'll finish it afterwards Reg. Fair enough. These are the two blokes I was telling you about Billy. Rama Km. Ragga Km. Good to meet you lads. It's a pleasure to meet you Mr Hill. We'd like to offer you our services. Billy Hill was Wise enough to know when to call it a day. He emigrated to Tangier Morocco with Gypsy, Where they ran the infamous Churchill's nightclub. He died on the 1st of January, 1984, aged 72. His fortune and reputation still intact. Jack wasn't so lucky or smart. He and Rita stayed together for 15 years and had two children before breaking up. Jack slowly retired from the criminal underworld, and ended up working as a barman, fruit seller an antique salesman amongst other things. He died in poverty on the 12th of March, 1996, aged 83.
