Do you realize this Nigerian coffee is being packed straight back to Nigeria? Frightening, isn't it? - Been here long? - Mr. Travis? - Long enough. - Mr. Travis! - Oh, see you. - Yeah. This Hessler is our latest machine. It gives a four-sided seal and runs 72 packs a minute. Any fault in the plastic packing can cause a break. The coffee is returned to our patent coffee processor. Now, why is that? Mr. Biles? - I've been off sick, sir. - Eliminates waste, sir. Absolutely correct. Always remember, gentlemen, that you are a failure in catering... ...if you don't know what to do with your leftovers. Right, I'll take them off your hands now, Mr. Stone. Follow me, gentlemen. Now, gentlemen... ...you have learned the number one truth. That a cup of Imperial Coffee is the only proper way to finish a meal. Be it in a palace or a prison. But between the making and the drinking must stand the salesman. This is where you come in. You will be our representatives in the frontline. Each one of you is going to have to prove himself on the battlefield of sales. It's a hard road you'll have to travel. There will be whole days when you won't sell a bean... ...but you will go out the very next day and hit the jackpot. Mr. Duff, may I ask a question? - Certainly, Mr. Travers. - Travis. Beg your pardon. How much does a top salesman get paid? Your basic salary will be low, of course, 11.50 pounds per week, before tax. But for a good man, with commission, the sky is the limit. Our star salesman at the moment... ...a wonderful man called Jim Oswald... ...takes home anything from 75 pounds... ...to 150 pounds a week. Now, I have never lied to you... ...never given you false hopes... ...but I believe in you. With a coffee pack in one hand and your sales list in the other... ...I want you to be one long line... ...of shining success. From John O'Groat's to Land's End. Now, selling is psychology. A good salesman must know something about psychology. And in that particular field, I can think of no better authority... ...than our chief of public relations, Mrs. Gloria Rowe. Mr. Spalding, please. Come here, Mr. Spalding. Smile. Smile, Mr. Spalding. Imperial product is good. But people don't buy things just because they're good. They have to believe. And you have to inspire that belief. You have to believe. Remember the words of William Blake. "A sincere belief that anything is so, will make it so." Sincerity. Honesty. Mr. MacIntyre, Mr. Travis, Mr. Greasy. - Thank you, Mr. Spalding. - Thank you. Hello, Mr. MacIntyre. Smile. Give with all your heart. Don't think of yourself. Relax those cheek muscles. Smile, Mr. MacIntyre. Mr. Travis. Morning, Mrs. Rowe. Now, that is sincerity. That is a completely sincere smile. If I was a buyer and these were two travellers... ...I'd definitely buy from the guy I like. I'd definitely buy from the sincere personality. I'm definitely going to buy from you, Mr. Travis. Lecture hall here. Duff speaking. Now, Mr. Travis, I want you to smile at Mr. Greasy. Mr. Greasy, smile back and give Mr. Travis a firm handshake. Certainly. Right away, sir. Mr. Greasy, don't think I'm being personal... ...but we're when dealing with food products, hygiene must be our motto. Make sure you've got clean fingernails. - Mrs. Rowe? - Yes. The chairman wants to see us immediately. Take a break, gentlemen. I'll see you on the shop floor in 20 minutes. Gentlemen, I have very bad news. Oswald has left the Northeast. Left? Vanished. Disappeared. No notice. Nothing. Just one ruddy great hole on the map. And that's not all. Oswald is suspected of trafficking in stolen goods under imperial's name. - My God. - Oh, God. Well, I need an immediate replacement. Mr. Duff, how are your trainees? They're very good, sir. But they need another two weeks. No, no, I can't wait. Mrs. Rowe. Now, what's your instinct say? Who's my man? Can you sniff him? Travis. That's your man. Travis, we're in a jam. You heard about Oswald? It's a case of all hands to the pumps. I understand, sir. Now, Mrs. Rowe has spoken highly of you... ...and I have never known her wrong... ...so I'm going to play her hunch. I'm giving you the Northeast. Now, that's as far north as the border... ...as far west as Lancashire... ...and as far south as the Humber. It's a big challenge. Do you think you're up to it? I know I am, sir. Normally, an opportunity like this wouldn't come your way for 10 or 20 years. Men far more experienced than you have had their shot at it... ...and been broken by it. But you've got guts... ...and you've got ambition... ...and that gives you a head start. Good luck. Now, there's your card. Never travel without it. Your map... ...your compass... ...and your car keys. Now go out there and fight. I will, sir. Every inch of the way. You can rely on me. Good man. He's all yours now, Mrs. Rowe. Oh, and Travis... Thank you very much, sir. Come here, Mr. Travis. I am going to give you a simple test. Be very careful how you answer. I want you to taste these cups of coffee... ...and tell me what they do for you. Sturdy... ...plebian... ...plenty of body. A vigorous robusta? Spicy. Now this. The future is in your hands, Mr. Travis. Take it. Now. ~ Poor people are poor people ~ ~ And they don't understand ~ ~ A man's got to make whatever he wants ~ ~ And take it with his own hands ~ ~ Poor people stay poor people ~ ~ And they never get to see ~ ~ Someone's got to win in the human race ~ ~ If it isn't you then it has to be me ~ ~ So smile while you're making it ~ ~ Laugh while you're taking it ~ ~ Even though you're faking it ~ ~ Nobody's gonna know ~ ~ Nobody's gonna know ~ ~ No use mumbling ~ ~ It's no use grumbling ~ ~ Life just isn't fair ~ ~ There's no easy days ~ ~ There's no easy ways ~ ~ Just get out there and do it ~ ~ And sing and they'll sing your song ~ ~ Laugh while you're getting on ~ ~ Smile and they'll string along ~ ~ And nobody's gonna know ~ ~ Nobody's gonna know ~ ~ Nobody's gonna know ~ ~ And nobody's gonna know ~ Commenting on the... and much of Central Southern England, though it probably won't reach... ... the East Midlands till after midnight.

Tell my mother. ~ Hold me close wherever we go ~ He's gone. Now scarper. But what about him? Done for. Perforated kidneys. It was his fault. He was driving too fast. Oh, we can see what happened. We'll be witnesses. Save you the trouble. Oh, it's no trouble. I can give you a statement. As far as we're concerned, it's a private accident. No one else involved. Unless you give a statement. Then our chief constable might find you're involved. He might bring charges against you. Using us as witnesses. Our word against yours. So on your way, chummy. Unless you want booking for manslaughter. There you are. Fair dos. Fair dos. A report from our Belfast newsroom. Two gunmen fired seven shots, aimed it seems at the sentries on duty... ... in the grounds of the general's house which is heavily guarded by soldiers... ... and security staff with dogs. Soldiers fired back and later found traces of blood... ... which lead them to believe they hit one of the gunmen. The Egyptian War Minister, General Sadek, has resigned. The move was seen as a reflection of the dissension in Egypt... ... over the country's relationship with the Soviet Union. And tonight it's your line on the subject of mental health. It's estimated that one in six women, and one in nine men... ... will enter a hospital at least once in their lives because of mental illness. What are the causes of the steady increase in mental illness? Can they be avoided? Are we spending enough care and money... ... on the mentally sick and the mentally handicapped? Are they better treated in hospital or in their own homes and communities? Mr. Travis? Hello. Good evening. - Come in. - Thank you. I was getting quite worried about you. It can be a nasty drive over those moors. Still, here you are safe and sound. Bill! Would you sign the book, please? You've missed supper... ...but I'll do you something special. Bill, would you show Mr. Travis to his room? Thank you very much. Oh, Mr. Travis... ...I'm afraid Mr. Oswald left quite a lot behind. I put it in one of the drawers. I didn't like to throw it out. That's all right. I'll manage, thank you. So you're the new rabbit? You're the replacement, are you? - Who are you? - Oh, I live here. Don't let me hold you up. Would you like a cigarette? Oh, sorry. You look a bit young. Well, you need a young man for a job like this. Possibly. Did you ever meet your predecessor? - Oswald? - Oswald. No, I've only been with the firm five weeks. That stuff's no good. I told him. Why did he scarper? Luck. Opportunity. He took off. No stamina. That's what you've gotta have in a job like this. Stamina. You've got to have it. Providing, of course, you've got the technical know-how. Nothing else you need? Well, you've got to have ambition. Mr. Travis? Yes, Mrs. Ball. I've got your supper ready. It's in the parlour. Thank you, Mrs. Ball. I'll be right down. Watch out for her treacle tart.

Mrs. Williams? - Who? - Mrs. Williams. Catering manageress. She doesn't come in anymore. It's urgent. There's nothing urgent around here. They're closing us down. - Closing you down? - Paying us off. Why? - Five thousand men? - That's right. Redundant. Good evening. I'd like to see the catering manager, Mr. Faulkner. - And it's Mr...? - Travis. Imperial Coffee. I'll see if he's still on duty. You can sit down. It's Imperial Coffee, Mr. Johnson. Mr. Travis. - Lovely evening, Mr. Faulkner. - Charlie Johnson. Sit down. Panatela? Thank you very much. Thank you. Is Mr. Faulkner off? No, no, but I'm the manager here. I like to keep my contacts personal. So do I. - You'll be replacing your previous colleague? - Correct. Sad business that. Still, I take it the arrangements will be as were? Yes, Mr. Johnson. Yes. It's Mayor Johnson, to be precise. I've still got three months in office. Good. Well, I'll give you all the help I can. Not only here, but in Leeds, Doncaster, Wakefield and other cities... ...of major importance surrounding. You can confirm with Faulkner that we'll be continuing our standing bulk order. In fact, you'll find him around the back now. You've just come at the right time. We're having a bit of a party. Do you like you know what? - What, Mayor Johnson? - A party. Oh, yes. - Absolutely delighted. - Right. Come on then. - Good evening, mayor. - Good evening. Have they fixed that TV set in the Rockingham suite yet? - They're doing it now. - Good. Telly Rent. Marvellous firm. I'm on the board, you know? If ever you want a telly. Very fortunate your coming on a Tuesday. We always have a bit of a gathering on Tuesdays. You'll make some useful contacts. Always best to meet people when they're relaxed. Plenty of variety. Promise you that. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. This is Mr. Travis, Linda. That's Linda. - Happy to greet you. - Pleased to meet you too. - Get my coat, love. - Well, thank you. You'll enjoy yourself here, I can tell you. Hey, sit down, will you? Sit down. - Hello, Mr. Johnson. - Hello, Harry. - Sit down. - Ta. New member? Yes. This is Mr. Travis of Imperial Coffee. Glad you could make it tonight. Harry Wilson, tax office. - Great pleasure to meet you. - Chief inspector. Any little business problems you run up against, let me know. - Attenborough. I edit the local rag. - Very pleased to meet you. - This is Jackie. - Happy to greet you. - Pleasure. - Wakedale Echo. Invaluable to a man in your line. Comes out every Thursday. Have you met Maureen? Maureen, Maureen. - Say hello to Mr. Travis. - How do you do? Pleased to meet you, Mr. Travis. Barlow, county constabulary. - Pleased to meet you. - Superintendent. At your service. And this is Mavis. Now, you be nice to Mr. Travis, Mavis. - But not too nice. - Happy to greet you. - Great pleasure. - Come here. Come here. Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to the part of the show you've all been waiting for. We have a first-class selection for you. All your favourites... ...and one or two novelties.

Imperial Coffee. Becky. Mind if I borrow your knee? Thank you. Michael. Mrs. Ball? Mary. Mr. Travis. Wanted on the phone. Urgent. Hello? Hello? Gloria. What? What's that? Scotland as well? I haven't any warm clothing. Yes, but I'm doing well here. Building up some fabulous contacts. I don't wanna throw it away. Yes, I see it's a challenge. Tomorrow? But where? Well, that's 200 miles away. By 10 a.m.? Who do I ask for? Yeah. Who? Who? Hello? Hello, Gloria? Hello? Mr. Travis. Did you hear that? Do you think I ought to go? I've got something for you. Come on, try it on. Arms up. A perfect fit. It's good. It really is good. You'll find it surprisingly warm. I'll be back. I promise I will. Try not to die like a dog. The blessing. Lord, on the way to goodness... ... when we stumble, hold us. When we fall, lift us up. When are hard-pressed by evil, deliver us. Soyuz 11 's braking system for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere was switched off. A soft-landing engine fired according to plan... ... and a smooth landing was made in the arranged area. Presumably somewhere in Kazakhstan. A helicopter-born recovery crew... ... which landed simultaneously with Soyuz 11... ... opened the hatch and found the three cosmonauts dead. Now, zazen. What does that mean? Zazen is a way of sitting cross-legged and with an erect back... ... practicing the art of Zen. And Zen means? To understand life, to be with life, to get a feeling of life... ... so that in effect all your days are good days... ... and every day should be looked upon as living in the moment... ... rather than in the past or future. And this is really what Zen is all about. Living now. Now, tell me how we come by this illumination... ... this awareness that is at the heart of the practice called zazen. Is it very hard practice. Nothing is acquired in a day. And yet I understand that this illumination does come suddenly. It comes suddenly. It comes in many ways. One could be arranging a vase of flowers... I'm asking you not to give any trouble. I want you on the ground before I count three. One, two... - I'm only trying to find out where I am. - Don't kick or butt with your head... ...and you won't get hurt. Okay, chaps, get him in. Most places will have a cloudy day and there will be rain and drizzle at times. Now, Mr. Travis... ...you realize where you are? You know where you are, Mr. Travis? Yes. Your pass? - What's in these packets? - Coffee samples. Hey, that happens to be company property. I have to account for every single bean. Otherwise, I'm in trouble. You are in trouble. Who are you working for? - Gloria Rowe. - Who else? What do you mean, who else? Who are you working for? The Imperial Coffee Company. Who do you know in this establishment? I don't know anybody. But who were you expecting to contact? The catering manager, Mr. Woolley. Has three children. Plays billiards. Sign this, please. Where the crosses are. - What is it? - Your confession. I don't know what I've done. I haven't done anything. You'll find it easier if you sign. I haven't done anything. Bassett. - Tea or coffee? - Tea, please. Two sugars. Coffee, black. Thank you. - Tea, Bassett? - No, thank you, sir. - Chocolate biscuit? - Please. That'll be three P for the biscuit. - Would the young man like a cup of tea? - Later. There's no need to go through all this, you know? You've only got to sign the paper. But I'm innocent. I haven't done anything. There are three things you can be sure of: The pain is not going to stop... ...you will remain conscious... ...and in the end, you will sign. Bassett. Now... ...let's start at the beginning. When did you join the party? Last year. How much are they paying you? - Three hundred a month. - Three hundred what? Pounds. Rubles. Was your headmaster correct to expel you from school? Yes. Do you believe children are the hope of the future? Yes. Do you believe in the fellowship of man? - Yes. - Think carefully. No. Do you rate loyalty above obedience? Always leave everything in a mess. I keep telling them. recently began a project to clear the local beach... ... a piece of woodland. The whole school, with the help of the Cleansing Department... ... of the local authority, cleared five wagon-loads of rubbish. Others planted 40 trees with help of the Parks Department. This is to be a manual affair.

Do give thee most humble and hearty thanks. For all thy goodness and loving kindness to us and to all men. For all thy goodness and loving kindness to us and to all men.

You'll find the motorway. Go south. Kit. May. The children will show you the way. Remember, go south. There's nothing in the north for a boy like you. Good luck. Come on. - Where are you making for? - London. In a hurry? - Why? - Like to pick up some spare cash? - What for? - Nothing much. Scientific research. Medical. You know the kind of thing? We need volunteers. - How much? - Hundred quid. Hundred and fifty and you're on. I'm not authorized to vary the terms, sir... ...but if you'd like to come up to the centre, you can talk it over with the chief. Okay, okay. Okay. - Good morning. - Good morning. Welcome to the Millar Clinic. Will you take a chair, please? - Will you take a chair, please? - Oh, thank you. Your full name, please, sir. Michael Arnold Travis. - And yours, madam? - Elizabeth Valerie Stewart. E. V. Stewart. - M. A. Travis. - How much are they paying you? Hundred and fifty pounds. I'm getting 75 and all the food I can eat. Professor Millar will be with you in a minute. You must have inhaled at least 3 milligrams of Novocain. Sir. So that's a distinct improvement. - Doctor Bee? - Sir? Yes, professor? I'll be coming into your department at 11. I'll want Mrs. Unwin under the pathescope. We may have to remodel her transplant. - Certainly, professor. - How long is it now? - Three hundred and fifty seven days. - Frenkel in Boston... ...kept one surviving for 14 months. I'd like to beat him. You will, sir. - Professor Millar... - one moment, Houston... The new intake is ready, professor. Splendid. Oh, Professor Millar, can I borrow a heart from the organ bank for three days? I'll have to come back to you on that one, Houston. We may need everything we've got this week. - Delighted to have you here. - Very well. - I'm Professor Millar. - How do you do, sir. Do sit down. Excuse me. Interesting. Good. I'm delighted to have you here. I'll see you both later. Sister Hallett, Room 9 for Mr. Travis... ...and 36 for Mrs. Stewart. I'll want a complete analysis on Travis by this afternoon. Yes, professor. Hughes, Keating, please. Waterworks, okay? Yes, fine, thank you. No inherent madness in the family? No, none whatsoever. Where's she taking my suit? Don't worry, you'll find it in your wardrobe. - Just flex your wrist. - Ever seen insects... ...crawling up the walls? No fits? No, never. - Ready when you are, Stanley. - No typhoid, cholera, epilepsy? Usual jabs at childhood? All right. Here we go. Hello. E.X. At 82 percent. - Are you sure? - Well, have a look. Frontal circuit 7.4, rear lobes neutral. Step it up a bit. J. M. Will be happy about this. Michael, I don't know if anyone's ever told you this... ...but you happen to belong to a very rare group of encephaloids. - What's that supposed to mean? - Essentially, it means... ...that you are in a position to be particularly helpful to us in our research. What kind of research? What do you think is the most successful animal that's ever lived on this earth. The ant? The dinosaur. Do you realize that the dinosaurs dominated this globe for 140 millions years... ...before they became extinct? Man has been on this planet for only a fraction over 40,000 years... ...and yet already he faces extinction. In fact, the species will be lucky to survive beyond the year 2010. Mankind has only one hope. Science. Technology is the survival kit of the human race. Even the politicians realize this. What they don't, or won't, realize, is that the technical solutions... ...are already within our power. The entire population of India could be rehoused on the moon within 10 years. It's only a matter of learning to live in a new way. Absolutely still. We have almost conquered the concept of disease. With present transplant techniques... ...there is no reason why everyone shouldn't live to be 250 or 300 years old... ...instead of our present miserable 70 or 80 years. We're on the verge of a series of discoveries that will transform... ...our conception of human life. What's all this got to do with me? Michael, at this very moment... ...in laboratories throughout the world, life is being created. It's only a matter of years, perhaps even months... ...before we can produce a whole generation of new and far more fully adapted creatures. I have a mongrel in the experimental wing here who can't tie his own shoelaces. By the end of the summer, he'll be a contract bridge champion. Falling in love, making love. We'll no longer need to depend on this inefficient way of distributing random genes. Computers programmed to select the correctly matched... ...DNA molecules will be able to produce an entirely satisfactory human breed. This is the future, Michael. This is the work for which I need your help. Yes, but what's gonna happen to me? Will I come out the same as I went in? Not the same... ...better. Now, I would just like you to sign this release form. "I hereby consent to lease the Millar Research Clinic... ...all physical experimental rights in my body... ...for one week for the sum of 100 pounds." I'd like to help, Professor Millar... ...but 150 pounds is definitely my minimum price. Definitely. A figure like that is just beyond us. One hundred and fifty pounds, and I'm not going to argue about it. A hundred and thirty. A hundred and forty five. A hundred and thirty five. A hundred and forty. Done. Sign by the cross. Sister Hallett? Yes, professor? Give Mr. Travis a sedative. Certainly. Sleep well, Michael. - All quiet? - Yes, professor. - No fluctuations? - Quite stable. I'll take him first. It'll be a long job. Four or five hours. Do you think it'll take, professor? There's an even chance. - He's in reasonably good condition. - Oh, yes. - Is he sterilized yet? - Not yet, professor. - You better send for Doctor Bee. - Yes, professor. We require two injections during the night. One at 12 and one at 4. Is that understood? It's all right. How much are they paying you? How much are they paying you? Hello, is there anybody there? For chrissake! You could have killed me! - Why don't you look where you're going? - Are you all right? Hey, cut the conference! Look at my bloody suit! Are you suing us or are we suing you? - You going to London? - Yeah, we were. Can you give us a lift? Okay? Yeah, come on, get in. Sit in the back there and keep your mouth shut. - Mind the board. - It's the Golden Wonder. Come on, Streaky. Aggravate the gravel. If you don't take that castle soon, the National Trust will. You're shivering. I'm wet. Take off that jacket. And that. Alan, pass us the rug. And the bottle. Take off your trousers. Come on, strip off. What? Here? Get them off. This is Patricia. She's very intelligent. She's making a study of us. Thank you. What are you? What do you do? They're musicians. We just trying to make some bread, that's all, mate. Are you rich? No, but my manager is. Careful of those. That's gold thread. Nylon. Checkmate, Dave. Never mind, at least you got it wrong. Come over here. Waifs and strays, she never could resist. - How long? - About an hour.

Could you hold this for me? What is it? Om. It means infinity, or godhead. Are you a Buddhist? All religions are equally true. Breakfast. London. The biggest money market in the world. Did you know that? Ten thousand million pounds a day turnover. Ten thousand millions a day, and there's a thousand ways of making it, you know? It's just a question of picking the right one. Open this. Champagne. Of course. Glass palaces. Just look at them. One day I'll own one of those. You're very old-fashioned. What do you mean, I'm old-fashioned? Well, all this stuff about money and owning things. If you want something, just take it. I always do. Where did you get this from? Home. Do you go there often? Sometimes. When I get bored. And where does all this other stuff come from? That comes from home too. Daddy's got so much he never misses anything. You're lucky. I've got to get there on my own. - Get where? - Right to the top. How much is a building like that worth? The ground rent is 800,000 pounds a year. It cost 10 times that to build. And every three months its value increases by 20 percent. How do you know? My father owns it. Really? It's beautiful. I'd like to meet your father. You've got lovely eyes. Introduce us then. I've been a top salesman. Earned 100 pounds one week. You're so greedy. Tell me more about your father. He owns half the copper mines in the world. He's absolutely ruthless. For every 5 million pounds he invests... ...he makes half a million pounds profit. In Bolivia... ...he drove half a million peasants off their land. They starved to death. Fifty million pounds profit. He's the most evil man you could ever hope to meet. Are you coming or staying? Coming. Hey, where are you going? Don't go. Have a good day. Remember... ...all that glisters is not gold. Hello, can I speak to Mr. Burgess, please? Yes, yes, of course, sir. Sir James, yes. Well, it's about his daughter. Yes, it's very urgent. I'm sorry, but it's absolutely confidential. It's a matter of life and death. Well, you'll just have to interrupt him then, won't you? Hello, Sir James? Hello, I'm Michael Travis. It's about Patricia. She's in trouble. Well, she's safe at the moment but I'm not sure how long it can be guaranteed. No, Sir James, I really cannot discuss this on the telephone. I'm sure you understand. Well, I do have rather a full afternoon but I could see you in say, 45 minutes. No, Sir James, I'm not a psychiatrist. Good. Oh, by the way, Sir James... ...which is your nearest tube station? Thank you. Mr. Travis? Would you mind taking a seat and waiting a few moments? - Sir James is still in conference. - Thank you. It's only a question of time. Another six months is all I need. Three? No, no, no! - You rotten bastard! You swine! - You must calm down. Can't you see it's a revolutionary concept? Twenty five years of my life. Twenty five years wasted. Twenty five years down the drain. - Oh, God! All wasted! - Professor... - Professor, you must restrain yourself. - You bastard! You swine! Professor. Help me. I won't go. I'll never go. Don't let them do it. Miss Hunter, two Valium and a barley wine for Professor Stewart. William, a chair for Professor Stewart. Mr. Travis. Sir James' time is worth 500 pounds per minute. Please keep it short. Mr. Michael Travis, Sir James. Well, young man. I won't beat about the bush, sir. It's your... I won't beat about the bush, sir. It's your daughter, Patricia. She's in bad trouble. What kind of trouble? Well, sir, the usual. Bad company, protests, drugs. Oh, all that. Yes. I think we can save her, sir. I think she should come back to her family... ...a family background. Do you even know where she is, sir? It must be heart-breaking for you, Sir James. You amaze me. She needs you, Sir James. How strange. The trouble is, I'm so frightfully busy. No, no, no. - I'm not gonna stand for it. - Professor. - Professor, please. - I'm going back in there. All right, if that's what you want. But here, now, in front of your very eyes, Sir James. - Now! - William. William, stop him at all costs. - Professor, please. - Now, now. - Professor, for God's sake. - Let me go! Let me go! - Miss Hunter. - Yes, Sir James. Ask the senior staff to come to my office. I'm afraid I have some very grave and distressing news for you. Professor Stewart is dead. Professor Stewart started life 55 years ago... ...of humble parentage. His father was a watchmaker in Glasgow. At the age of 16, he gained a scholarship to Cambridge. During the war his vital research into the military application of electronics... ...led to his rapid promotion to the rank of major. After the war... ...he gave to this company the same loyalty that he had before given to the nation. Now, Professor Stewart was not only an inventor of genius... ...but all who came in contact with him felt it a privilege to have known... ...and loved him. Sir James, it's 10 past 5. Your appointment with Dr. Munda. Thank you, Miss Hunter. Professor Stewart was too far in advance of his time... ...but his name will live long. We will stand in silence in grateful memory for 15 seconds. Miss Hunter, send a memo to the chief accountant. A gratuity of 740 pound per annum to his widow. Fix the funeral for Wednesday, Golders Green. And get me Vancouver. Pity about Stewart. Brilliant man, of course, but an academic. Couldn't run a toffee shop. In business there's an animal who succeeds and an animal who doesn't. That may be my call to Vancouver. Vancouver, Canada, Sir James. Charles? James. I talked to the board. Unanimous decision, I'm afraid. We'll have to have your resignation by midnight. No. Two million dollars compensation is our maximum. Well, it's your decision of course. But if you don't... ...things could be pretty upsetting for Kitty. Yes. Bye. - Good evening, Sir James. - Good evening. - Good evening, Sir James. - Sorry to keep you. Had a little hold up at the office. - My assistant, Michael... - Travis. - Travis. - Morrison. - Pleased to meet you. - This way, sir. Sir James, how good of you to come. Mr. President. My minister of finance, Mr. Timothy Souza. - How do you do? - Madame Paillard. My home secretary, Mrs. Naidu. - How do you do? - Colonel Steiger. - Colonel. - Sir. - Mr. Oswald. - Sir James. And the Right Honourable Basil Keyes, I think you know. - Basil. - James. Do sit down, Sir James. Morrison, draw the curtains. Sir James... ...you are a man of business. You deal in facts and figures. Well, that is what we are here to give you today. My colleagues and I are confident... ...that we can offer you an association with our country... ...that will be as profitable to you as to ourselves. Film please, Brewster. The coastline of Zingara... ...an uninterrupted stretch of golden sand, perfect for swimming, water sports... ...and all the leisure facilities demanded by holiday makers... ...from the industrial centres in Europe and the Americas. The island already boasts one large hotel. Visitors can take their ease in surroundings of luxury and sophistication. - A brandy, please. - Yes, sir. Picturesque entertainment is provided by Zingaran natives... ...performing their age-old rituals... ...for patrons of our holiday lodges in the hill district. Here in surroundings of peace and calm... ...staffs are being specially trained satisfy European demands for courtesy and service. A massive program of hotel construction is already underway. Experienced European engineers are supervising the native labour force... ...in the construction of the Zingara Continental Hotel. Your brandy, sir. The completed hotel, with its splendid public facilities... ...provides 500 rooms. Each with colour television and private bathroom. Thank you, Brewster. Very attractive. But your plans for industry? Our free export zone will offer generous advantages... ...to all concerns financed by foreign capital. Repatriation of profits? Mr. Souza. Guaranteed to any country you care to nominate. Venezuela, the Vatican, Liechtenstein, et cetera. Oh, thanks very much. Labour costs? My home secretary, Mrs. Naidu, will explain the favourable arrangements... ...we are planning for this area. Labour conditions in Zingara offer excellent opportunities... ...for the foreign investor. Rates of pay and working conditions are regulated by the government. Consequently, strikes and slowdowns are a thing unknown. Film, Brewster, please. The efficiency and variety of our light industrial installations are a joy to behold. The Bumangi sausage factory has a daily output of over 2000 pounds... ...prime first-quality sausages. All 75 percent genuine meat. Special attention is paid to cleanliness. Experience has shown that production levels benefit considerably... ...when the sexes are segregated. The workers' living quarters are also segregated. Here is an ultra-modern male workers' camp on the outskirts of Bikana. Their women are housed in a similar camp some 35 miles distant. Male workers are paid the equivalent of 7 New-English pence per day... ...and females, at 3. Foreign technicians are welcome in Zingara. Life for our foreign visitors will be fully commensurate... ...with the standards of living and convenience... ...enjoyed by their colleagues in America or the European Common Market. They will also be exempted from all personal income tax. Thank you. Thank you, Sir James. Well, Sir James. I hope we have convinced you that Zingara today presents a unique opportunity... ...for secure investment and a high rate of return. There is just one consideration... ...that troubles me, Mr. President. - Please. What guarantees can you provide for the safe-guarding of investment? I refer, of course, to the threat of insurrection. Sir James... ...I will be completely honest. It is true that a small element of our people... ...have been attempting to cause unrest in our northern territories. This problem we have firmly in hand. We're fortunate to have the services of Colonel Steiger... ...whose achievements in the Congo, Nigeria and more recently, Bangladesh... ...must be well-known to you. I have asked Colonel Steiger himself to report on the situation. The rebels number roughly 2000 men and women. Projection. They are operating in the northern territories in two main groups. My counter-offensive has taken the form of a two-pronged blitz... ...blanket bombardment by artillery and aircraft... ...followed by landings of airborne policing detachments... ...employing scorched-earth and random-elimination techniques. My men are professionals, experienced in guerilla warfare. The rebels are amateurs, inexperienced and weak in defence. So insurgent losses are heavy. Over 300 killed. Four hundred and fifty captured and interned. In view of your undoubted superiority, Colonel Steiger... ...can you tell us why this insurrection still persists? The terrain is unfavourable, sir. Jungle and swamp favour the native. That is why we need honey. Honey? Precisely. Your British honey. The substance known as PL-45. Or in the terminology of my profession, "honey." Let me show you some examples. Slide, please. This is a man who has received a light exposure to this invaluable weapon. And again. And again. And again. And again. A beer mug full of honey can create a lethal zone... ...for all forms of terrestrial life within an area of 15 acres. Low-flying aircraft spraying PL-45... ...can cover 100 square miles in two hours. Thank you. This is all I need to finish the job. Impressive. But you understand, Colonel Steiger... ...that granted supplies of adequate quantities of honey... ...you are prepared to guarantee the internal stability of your territory? You have my word. Basil, a moment. Champagne, monsieur? - Thank you very much, ma'am. - Please. Thank you. Glad to see you made it, old boy. Stick with the old man. You'll run a good wicket. Cheers. - Cheers. - Yes Yes. Excuse me. Excuse me. I don't think you've met my new assistant, Travis. Travis, this is Basil Keyes. I could send Travis along sometime tomorrow. We've got a night sitting, that should finish before lunch. - So anywhere near the House of Commons. - Right. Mr. President, I'll take these documents home with me, if I may. Study them thoroughly. I shan't keep you waiting. - Well, it must be all of 40 years. - Thirty nine. - I shared digs with the president's brother. - How nice. I shall never forget that wonderful spring morning in your room at Balliol. You and Peter drunk on the bookshelves. Karl Marx and Keynes on the floor. - How is Peter? - In detention, alas. I was urged to hang him but for once I was weak. "Power creates the man." Tacitus. Cheers. Thank you, Warner. About half an hour. - She never gets out of bed. - Oh, rotten luck. - Do sit down. - Thank you. - Hello, Frank. - Good afternoon, sir. - Mr. Travis will have a... - A dry martini, very dry. - Dry martini, Frank, and a large scotch. - Thank you, sir. I don't think you'll run into any trouble. They've got their briefing. They're all good chaps. Everything's under control. Good luck. And don't leave any fingerprints. ~ When there's a bluebird Singing by your windowpane ~ ~ And the sun shines bright all day through ~ ~ Don't forget, boy Look over your shoulder ~ ~ Because there's always Someone coming after you ~ ~ You ~ - Like a brandy, Warner? - Not for me, sir. - I never touch a drop on the job. - Of course, of course. ~ When everything in life Seems just as it should be ~ ~ At last success Seems just around the door ~ ~ Don't forget, boy Look over your shoulder ~ ~ Because things don't stay the same For evermore ~ ~ Hope springs eternal In a young man's breast ~ ~ And he dreams of a better life ahead ~ ~ Without that dream You are nothing, nothing, nothing ~ ~ You have to find out for yourself That dream is dead ~ ~ Dead ~ ~ Dead ~ ~ Dead ~ Hello, there. - There you are. - How do you do? - Pleased to meet you. Travis. - Wallis. - Had a good run down? - Fine, thank you. Fine. Got the bumf, have you? Good. Nearly there. Good, good, good. We're over here. Sergeant Beevers. We've got the okay to take off. Do the necessary, will you? Yes, sir. Ground control to pilot/navigator. Destination Honey. Flight AT-060 is Zingara International Airport. Take off one-five minutes. Roger, ground control. Will do. - Sign by the cross, sir. - Oh, thank you. Twelve thousand gallons of the stuff there. You could do half East Africa with that, Mr. Travis. And of course, it was your flag that went up and ours that came down. And the extraordinary thing was that the duchess never even noticed. That will be all, thank you, Jenkins. Well, gentlemen, to business. Sir James, we would like the first instalment. In cash. Travis. This is the combination to the safe in my study. You will find a case there. - Bring it here. - Sir. - Please, darling. - Please, Dickey. - But you must. - Oh, don't go on, Dickey. I've never been very sure of myself. Not until I found you. You drink too much. I know. You're my last chance. Oh, little Dickey. My God. Michael. Patricia. What are you doing here? This is my home. - Well, who was that? - Dickey? The Duke of Belminster. He's an old friend of mine. What does he want? He wants to marry me. Well, you can't. I might. I haven't decided yet. But I love you and I'm going to marry you. Look. Oh, Michael. You're so hopelessly conventional. I told you I was gonna be a success. And I am. I did warn you. Wait here for me. Thank you, Michael. Sir James, we need a witness. Travis. Who? I see. Yes. Of course not. Show them up. The fraud squad. Now, please, everyone, keep quite calm. Inspector Carding is a very decent fellow. Mr. Souza, if you please. Travis. Put those in your pocket. The case please. Sit down. Hold this. Inspector Carding. Good evening, inspector. Good evening, Sir James. - I'm sorry to disturb you, Sir James. - Not at all. I think you know everybody here. Except perhaps my new assistant, Michael Travis. He hasn't been with me very long. It is Mr. Travis I wish to interview. With your permission, of course. Now, is there anyone here you recognize? Yes. That is the man. Thank you, Beevers. I beg your pardon, Mr. Travis, may I have that bag? Just a minute. Did you sign this, sir? Yes. Is this your signature, sir? Yes. Is this your signature, sir? No. Is this your signature, sir? Oh, no. Complete forgery. Not worth the paper it's written on. Bag, please. Do you realize it's an offence to export bullion from the U.K. Without... ...the permission of the Bank of England? - Yes. When I came into this room, that bag was in your possession? Yes. Would you mind, sir? All right, Michael. Trust me. I'll take that, Carding. I'm so sorry to have disturbed you, Sir James Dr. Munda.

Now, Travis, was given a position of great trust by his benefactor. One of England's most eminent industrialists. He repaid that trust... ...by seeking to export for his own gain, 10 million pounds... ...of his employer's money. Was this the action of an innocent? If such perfidy can be committed without fear of retribution... ...then how can the rule of law, patriotism, duty... ...the very basis of our society, hope to survive? Well, go and consider your verdict carefully. And take your time. Be upstanding in court. Be upstanding in court. Members of the jury... ...have you arrived at a verdict on which you are all agreed? - We have, My Lord. - Do you find the prisoner guilty... ...or not guilty? - Guilty, My Lord. May I say how entirely I agree with that verdict. The prisoner will stand to receive sentence. Society is based on good faith... ...on a commonly accepted bond. It is the inflamed greed of people like you, Michael Travis... ...that has led to the present breakdown of our society. Before I pass sentence, have you anything to say? My Lord, I did my duty. I only wanted to be successful. I did my best. And you failed. I am innocent, My Lord. I sentence you to five years hard labour. Come on. There we are. Yeah. Come on. Come on. Yes. Come on. Let's have a look at you. There we are. Be gentle, be gentle. Let's have a look. Oh, that's better. Yes, there we are, hold still. Yeah. All right, Travis, you've done your stretch. Now smarten up for the governor. Well done, lad. Well, Travis, you're free. Free to rejoin the world of decent, ordinary men and women... ...who are content to earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brows. The brotherhood of man, Travis. I know where I went wrong, sir. I've been thinking. Good lad. I've read books... ...and I see things differently now, sir. Well, now, tell me. Have you...? Have you any plans? No plans, sir. I just want to get out there and learn to be a proper human being, sir. I'd like to... I'd like to read you something. I think it may help. "One that never turned his back but marched breast forward... ...never doubted clouds would break... ...never dreamed that wrong would triumph... ...held we fall to rise... ...sleep to wake." I'd like you to have this. It belonged to my grandmother... ...but you may find it will help you through the difficult days that lie ahead. Thank you very much, sir. I've sensed the spark of idealism in you... ...and that can move mountains, you know that? Oh, for a man like you, Travis... Michael, for a boy like you, you're still young. Everything is possible. The world is your oyster. I can see you stripped, building motorways. You have eyes like Steve McQueen. Did anyone ever tell you that? Goodbye, Travis. And good luck. MacIntyre. Biles. Eccles. Travis. Goodbye. Bye, Frank. Goodbye, old chap. I'll send you a postcard. Goodbye. - Lawrence! - Mommy! Thank you, Michael, for everything. Goodbye. Best of luck. Thank you. On your own? - On your own then? - Yes. - Anywhere to go? - I'll manage. Just a minute. - Do you want a lift? - No, thanks. I'm going the other way. Here. - What is it? - Down in the East End. Give you a start there. Be good. I won't be seeing you anymore. Well, good luck. It may not be as easy as you think. ~ It soothes his sorrows Heals his wounds ~ ~ And drives away his fear ~ ~ It makes the wounded spirit whole ~ ~ And calms the troubled breast ~ Thank you very much. ~ 'Tis manna to the hungry soul ~ ~ And to the weary rest ~ Would you like to help? Oh, sure I would. Are you sure you can spare it? Gladly. - You're from the prison, aren't you? - That's right. There's no need to be ashamed. I'm not ashamed. Glory, hallelujah! Major! Major! Major. ~ boundless stores of grace ~ ...and he's just come out of prison too. Brothers, today we have with us a young man... ...who has turned over a completely new leaf. He has only just left prison... ...yet he has given generously of his meagre store. Glory, hallelujah. Friend, will you step up beside me and bear witness? Bear witness? What to? Your sins. I don't believe in sin. Everybody sins. We know. Brother, be warned, you stand in great danger. I thought like you once, sir, but now I've learned better. People are good if you give them the chance. Oh, excuse me. - Oh, sorry. You all right? - Sorry, sorry. We've got to start with humanity. We must try and trust one another. People are good. Everyone has goodness in them. It's poverty. That's why people commit crimes. It's not poverty, laddie. It's the old Adam pride, envy, gluttony, sloth. A great philosopher once wrote something I'd like you all to hear. "My country is the world, and my religion is to do good." Tom Paine. Tom Paine denied God. He believed in mankind. Brother, we will pray for you. Let us all kneel together, friends. Oh, Lord, look down in mercy on this, our misguided brother. Guide his feet into the way of life. Remove the blindfold from his eyes. Lift up his gaze to the eternal hills... ...from whence cometh our only help. Amen. Bringing in the sheaves. ~ Sewing in the morning Sewing seeds of kindness ~ You bird! It's too flipping short!

Mighty improvement you are. Up here. Get this door open. Give us your bag. - Mrs. Richards. - Come out of there. Come on out. She's put the bed against the door. Double bolted it. She's gonna do it this time, you mark my words. Selfish bitch. She's got the kids in there with her. But she'll probably do them in and all. - What's the matter? What's wrong? - What's wrong? She's gonna kill herself, that's what's wrong. - Well, can't you stop her? - Well, go on then, you stop her. - Nobody's holding you back, are they? - Mrs. Richards! Mrs. Richards! What you gonna do? - It's dangerous. - Oh, my God. He'll never make it. - Oh, my God. - Oh, now, don't. Mrs. Richards. Mrs. Richards. Mrs. Richards, what are you doing? Cleaning the floor, what's it look like? What's all this about killing yourself? I've had enough. You've been shut up here too long. Think of the world outside. Mrs. Richards. Now, please stop it. I want you to listen. My husband has to find the place looking nice. I'll not have him saying I did wrong in the end. You should meet some people. Make some nice friends. I haven't been out since we had Penny. Not in six years. - Well, take a holiday. - Harry's off work. - Hasn't had a job for four years. - Well, think of the children. - I mean, they're the only ones who matter. - How can I keep a child clean? How much do you think a pair of kid's shoes costs? The cheapest? One pound twenty. Life is a gift, Mrs. Richards. You haven't the right to throw it away. Look, this is the food I buy each week for ourselves and the kids: Seven loaves of bread, 20 pounds of potatoes... ...three quarters of a pound of tea, a packet of porridge... ...two packs of cornflakes. - There's always tomorrow. One pack of Co-op soap powder, three or four pounds of cabbage... ...two swedes, custard powder... ...baked beans, sometimes, tinned tomatoes, sometimes... ...tinned spaghetti, sometimes, lettuce, when cheap. Food isn't everything. Fresh air! Sunshine... - Penny! - Yes, Mum. Bring the Brasso. Now, I want you to go over there, love. Wash the big pan under the hot tap. Get out every bit of tomato soup before your dad gets back. Mrs. Richards... Mrs. Richards... Please listen to this, Mrs. Richards. Now, please listen. "Life is mostly froth and bubble, two things stand like stone. Kindness in another's trouble, courage in your own." Who said that? Adam Lindsay Gordon. He was a poet. More of a fool, if you ask me. Well, wait then, Mrs. Richards. Now, wait, Mrs. Richards. Wait, Mrs. Richards. Listen to this. Please, Mrs. Richards. Mrs. Richards. Tell Harry to leave a note for the milkman. Two pints. - Penny. - Yes, Mum? "There's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow." Hamlet. Go on, go and sit over there. Be a good girl. Please listen, Mrs. Richards. Please listen to this. Now, this will really help, Mrs. Richards. Please listen carefully. "One that never turned his back but marched breast forward... ...never doubted clouds would break."
