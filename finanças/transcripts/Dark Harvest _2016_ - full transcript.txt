You gonna share that thing or what? No, not really, but go ahead. - I like this spot, man. - Yeah, it's not... I think you're gonna do well here. - It's good. - I feel it. It'll be good. Thank you. What are you gonna do if this shit goes legal? More people growing, more people buying lights, electric, open up another store. Maybe I'll be a big box hydroponic guy. High volume, low prices. I'll tell you what, this stuff goes completely legal, you're gonna be the guy that's in shit, man. - Okay. - Yeah. My advice to you, if I was you, I would get the fuck out of here and start a new business with a better class of people, you know, go to some place that's tropical. - Okay. - Where it's sunny everyday. Away from people like you and me? Far away. Yeah. You going back in? Yeah, I'll lock up. Here. - I'm studying. - Okay. See ya. French. - Where is it? - Upstairs! What kind of food do you want to get into to celebrate the new store? I feel like Cambodian tonight. - Okay. - All right? Ah fuck, I gotta roll, man. So you going to teach me some Spanish? What's up? Okay, let's do those numbers. You gotta get the numbers down. Okay, what's 14? They're gonna be impressed that you speak Spanish and we're gonna need it for this restaurant. And then now we get into the easy ones, it's 10 plus the number. Damn! How do you say marijuana in Spanish? Prison. - I've heard this before. - He's smiling. Seriously, that's what I'm saying. We're out and he's happy about it. He's happy. I can see that. I know. You all are crazy. Is that purple king? Purple king? - What? - That's what I smell. That's nice. It is nice. This is the last crop. Seems like I've heard that before. You've heard it before but this is the real one. Wow, okay. What are you gonna do? You still on about the restaurant? This is the plan for real? Yep, yep. You guys are gonna open a restaurant? - Yep. - We're done, that's it. Nicaragua, you coming or what? Yeah, what am I gonna do, flip burgers? No, you can be the bartender. Oh, the bartender, thanks. I'll make you guys your sugary drinks. Sea Breeze, anyone? You too! 1333 East 20th. He's got about 100 pounds in there and I'm sure it's Carter's. I can't believe you're back. I would have taken that injury money and split. Not my way. Show him the scar. Fucking scar, it's a fucking bear trap. Crushed my fuckin' leg bone and ligament in Carter's grow-op and got diddly-squat. - This it? - Yeah. Got two kids at home, Bernie, Christmas morning, let's fuckin' make this quick. Yes, sir. You're suck a fuckin' hotshot. Carl, with me, let's go. Stay in the back here so that squirrelly whirly doesn't find a hole to crawl out of. Police, police! Right there, right there, hands! - Let me see your hands! - Hands in the air! Down on the ground now! Put your hands behind your back. Your hands behind your back. I got him. All right, I got him. What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this? Hockey equipment, Bernie, really? Where'd you get this robe? No go, bullshit! And you've been watching this clown? Let's check the car. Where is it? Here, check out his shitbox. Fucking hockey equipment, are you fucking serious? So. Come on. Yeah, stupid. Fuckin' lie to me? You fuckin' hold back on me? You know what I can fuckin' do? See what I can fuckin' do? I can do fuckin' anything. Good. Bernie is gonna lose his fuckin' mind. Carl, Bernie is a useless piece of shit, you understand me? Where's Carter growing this shit? Nothing, Bernie, nothing. Where is it? Where the fuck? Where the fuck Hey, hey, hey! - Is Carter growing this shit? - All right, all right. Hey, let's go! Get outta here! This ain't the last time, little bubba. You're gonna be seeing us again real soon. - All right, on your feet. - What the fuck? - Come on, let's go. - Fuck. Tell Carter I'm coming for him. Simon, you didn't see anybody come around back, right? No, no. Bernie, I think you're gonna have to find this Carter character next year, buddy. Fuck. What do you think about leaving earlier? Like a week from now? - I think I can't. - How come? I've got the house to deal with, and I've got to wait on the divorce papers. Forget the divorce papers. You get the lawyer to deal with it, it's done. I can't do that. Mark just lost his plumbing license or ticket or whatever. He doesn't have a job and he's depressed. You're fired. Hey. Hey, you got a second? All right, listen, so the hockey equipment got taken. The bags are gone. What does that mean? Look, just, whatever you do, don't go to the old spot, okay? Move to a new spot. We'll figure this out, okay? But just... Dude. My life's in those bags. How's it going? Hey, man, going well. I'm excited, got my first customer. Oh, yeah, for what? Mm, come see. Get in there. I haven't even tried it yet. - You made that? - Yeah. You look surprised. Why you look so surprised? - Come on, man. - What, you think I bought it? - Yeah, you fuckin' bought it. - I didn't buy it. You didn't fuckin' shit. I'm eating it. It better be fucking good. It's good. I don't get sick. Mm. So what you think? Club Kamikaze? And I know what you're thinking. Raw fish in Nicaragua with that heat, that might be a problem, but those cats have some iron guts so we're in the clear. I need you to do me a favor and fire this back up for one more crop. This is the last crop, man. I'm cutting it tomorrow, you know that. I know but I'm in a jam. Zack lost all the weed. A man's got to know his limitations, Carter. That cultivation license is our ticket out of here now. You got to call Frank about his psychiatrist uncle. We got to find a guy to grow for us and send us the money to Nicaragua. Frank, I just came from your uncle's. He wants me to come back down there. I gave you guys $10,000. You told me in and out no problem, I get the cultivation license. I went in, I did my part. He's saying he wants to me to go back in there in a week. I don't have a week. Man, he's really nervous. He thinks the place is being bugged. Come on, man, buck up. Go back in there and tell him some real mental problems. You gotta prove you're screwed up. Go do it, one more time, man, come on, now. Fuck. At the beginning, you use this white light when the plants are small. Okay. When the plants get taller, you switch from the white light to this yellow light. Oh okay. Okay, so, white lights, 12 hours, and then the yellow light, 24... David, this is important. You're going to fuck with the universe of these plants. White light for 24 hours, so no darkness. Then the second and final stage, 12 hours of darkness, 12 hours of yellow light. See, when you switch from white to the yellow, the plant panics and starts producing buds 'cause they think that summer is over and it prepares to die. How many phones you got? - One. - Give it to me. A flip phone? Yeah, why? I don't know. Look, this is a double encrypted phone, here. No photos, no personal information, and you only use your handle. Handle? - Yeah, your username. - What's my username? ItalianStallion69, Carter said you're Italian. - Italian Stallion? - Yeah. - What's yours? - I don't have one yet. These phones are new. - How about yours? - Latin Heat. - Latin Heat? - Look. If the cops get this phone, put in a wrong password twice, it scrambles the network and sends a message to the server that it's been compromised, okay? So, if you get any trouble and you need a piece, come see me. A piece? I thought this was legal. It is legal. Yeah, it's legal, it's legal. Just, you know, in case anything happens. You'll be fine. Come here. I bring you the fucking kid and you pull out a fucking gun? - You want him to be safe? - Yeah. That's why I brought the gun. Look, this kid's no grower. That's why he's perfect. He looks innocent. Yeah, innocent, that's a good name for it. Come on. It's okay. Got how it works over there? - Yeah. - Okay. And you got a one-hour window everyday to leave and go get food. No friends, no family, no girlfriends, no ex-girlfriends. Just be calm, cool, and collected. This guy I had a house with set up a bunch of bear traps around the place, and a cop ended up stepping on one of them and couldn't walk again. So I don't want anything stupid, you got nothing to be worried about here, everything's cool. The place is legal, I've got the license, okay? - Yeah, you got it. - Okay. - Let's do it. - Okay, cool. All right, brother, let's do it. So, I'm in a fucking jam. There's a delay with this shrink that I've been dealing with for the cultivation license, and I was wondering if you know somebody that knows somebody that can get me a different one or if you want to get involved. Look, if I were you I'd be getting rid of this Italian kid and laying low. It's going to go legal. I can't fucking wait, man. If pot goes legal, the price will tank and I'm done. You know, I knew this one shrink and he was selling locations to bikers and everybody got robbed. It's gonna go legal. This is the worst time to be doing what you're doing. So just chill. Make a taco. You're killing me. Where the fuck are you guys? You said 8:30. Carter? It's about fuckin' time. I've been waiting here half an hour. No Vince? This is Carter's spot? Oh yeah. Simon, around the front, fast! Over here. Black, 34 years old, deceased. Electrocuted. Earl Freeman. Any cash? No, nothing. You? Bernie? Yeah, I'm back. I thought those guys shut you down with all the medical licensing. Any cash? Nothing. This guy's been dead less than an hour. I'd say sometime around eight. - You guys were here at 8:30? - I was waiting around back in the alley, but we didn't come in until a little after 8:30. We were dealing with the Sarge on the new postings, so. - We were here 8:30 tops. - And you were here? Eight o'clock. Alone? No, with my imaginary friend. Yes, alone, that's my fucking job as lead investigator of this here Green Team. Hail Caesar. Both the bear trap house and the Freeman house were run by Carter. I just need a little more time to corner him with this phone. There is no Carter. And quite frankly, I don't give a goddamn whose grow-op it is anyways. We have a homicide and you were the only one who was there alone. So now we got two. Two what? We've got the three hockey bags from Zack's place at Christmas, and we've got the 105 plants from the Freeman house. There were no hockey bags at Christmas, and there was no pot there today. Exactly. So from where I'm sitting, you're either involved in the Freeman murder, or I gotta ask myself, what the fuck kind of detective stakes out a house while a murder is going down inside? Boss, come on, that thing slipped by the eyes in the back of my fuckin' head. These people are fuckin' animals, you know that. You're Internal Investigations' prime suspect. What? You're suspended. That bear trap nearly chopped off my fucking leg. I turned down the payoff to get this guy! Hi. Hey. We were thinking it'd be great if could get the divorce papers signed today. It's not really funny, Carter. Oh. Can you witness them? It doesn't matter who signs them, it's just... Your truck's leaking antifreeze all over the driveway. Mark. Hey, man, I'm glad you decided to come by, but. What, you wanna fight me? Fuckin' right I fuckin' do. Get the fuck up. Stay the fuck away from my wife. Are you okay? Carter, are you okay? Look at me. - Hello. - Carter? Who's this? Hands up. You fuckin' deaf? I'm a cop. You're Carter Holmes. You must be Alexis. Now, your friend Earl Freeman was murdered today in one of your grow-ops. Robbed then electrocuted. And you're gonna help me find the piece of shit who did it or I'm taking you in. See, Alexis's name is all over the lease of the grow house. And she's either gonna cut herself a deal or you're gonna come work for me. I'm a mechanic, I fix up cars and I re-sell them Put on the jewelry, hon. Carter. Here, put on the old Soviet jewelry. Do it. I don't know anybody named Earl. Come. Don't try to run. I'm a sharpshooter, baby, and I don't give a fuck who I hit. Come here! Please! Get me out of here! Can I come in? You okay? Get out. Fuckin' boy, you stay the fuck back there, peppy. I got an itchy trigger finger. Get out, get her out of there. This just might be your lucky break. Get over there. Keep moving, keep moving. I swear there's nothing fuckin' stopping me from pulling a straight bullet and fuck the both of you right now. Kneel down right there. Kneel down! - Look, look. - Kneel down! Hey, hey, I know Earl. Please! Okay, you're the only connection I got to Earl's murder. You gotta help me fuckin' find this guy. I will, I will. - You will? - Yeah. See how easy it is when you're agreeable? What's with her? She's fainting. Get her in the car. Babe, babe. Babe. Babe, I love you so much. The fuck is wrong with her? - A diabetic reaction. - What, a dia-what? Diabetic reaction. What it take to put a fuckin' candy bar in your pocket? - Hey. - You stupid fuckin' dumbass. - Hey! - You fuckin' with me? Don't you talk to me like that. Don't you raise your fuckin' voice at me. You don't think ahead at all. You think about anybody other than yourself? Let's just drop Alexis off at her house and I'll help you find the people that killed Earl. You don't need to hold us hostage. I'll do this with or without you. Cool. Okay, I gotta find the pip-squeak who's doing all this pillaging or I'm fucked. You understand, I'm totally fucked. You fuckin' look at me when I'm fuckin' talking to you, you fuckin' understand? Open your mouth. Open your fuckin' mouth. All right, and I don't give a fuck if this thing goes down in flames, 'cause I got nothing to lose. So you sit there like a pretty little kitty and don't cause no fuss or I'll blow your fuckin' girlfriend's head off. You got that? Stay put. Come on out, honey. Come on, let me help you out. You're going home. You're gonna help me find who turned your friend into a shish kebab. And when we're done, I don't want to hear the name Carter Holmes again. You got it? And you're going shut down all your grow-ops. They're all done, that was the last one. You smoke? No. I thought you smoked. No. Fuckin' cocksucker, you're smoking now, you piece of shit. Don't fuck with me. Don't you fuck with me, you be straight with me. You got a sweet deal here. You could be in the pen sucking cocks and getting fucked up the ass, you understand? For the pain. Let's take a look inside. Get out of the car. Door was wide open. Anybody else you know have a key? No. So what are you thinking? Well, you say the door was wide open, so obviously someone was let in unless they picked the lock. Does anybody other than Alexis know about this place? No. There, wait, all better. This here's Earl's phone. There's only two calls on the call log, one of them is yours, do you recognize this other one? This call was made four hours before Earl was killed. Why don't you dial it up and see if you recognize the voice on the other end. Hi, you have reached Candy. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you. Thank you. I just found Earl's phone. You can give me a call back at 113-725-7522. Thank you. Sound familiar? No. You hang on to that in case they call back. There's a sushi spot up the street that Earl kept going to, let's check that out first. Can you take these off? We are not open yet. Oh no, it's okay. We're just looking for a friend of mine, Earl Freeman. Black guy with a beard, comes in here all the time. Ah, yes, with the beard, Earl. You seen him lately at all? A few days ago. Was he with anyone? Just by himself. Does he usually come in here alone or does he come in here with a girlfriend, or a friend, or someone? He always sits there watching him make sushi, alone. Another man looks for Earl too. You have a friend. What do you mean? Handyman. The other day, white guy like you. What kind of a handyman? He came in here asking if his friend Earl was here, then tried to fix our fridge. He said this was dangerous, said he was a fridge repairman, handyman. You notice what kind of car he was driving? Color, no? It's that number from Earl's phone. Hello? - Mm, what is your name? - Carter, yours? Candy. So, he told you the deal, 200 for one hour, 300 for any fetishes, anything special. You go up there, you tell her you want to set up a threesome with Earl. See how she reacts. Then you fuck her. Whoa, you want me to bang this chick? Handjob, blowjob, footjob, whatever you like, so she's convinced of your veracity. Then make sure you get her outside and we'll follow her. Good dog. You nervous? No. The crazy ones are always nervous. When's the last time you saw Earl? I don't know. Let's not talk about Earl. You have a girlfriend? When's the last time you saw him? Come on, play. When's the last time you talked to him on the phone? Room service. Get off me. Room service. Who the fuck are you? Where do you live? I have never been to your friend's place. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Let me see your immigration papers. Come on. Yeah, go get them. Look, all I know is that he was complaining about a windowless van following him. He thought it was a cop. Following him? Regina Vesela? Regina Vesela, that's my Slovak name. Regina, with the G, the V, the vag. How do you get Candy out of that? Where'd the Candy come from? Where you hiding the candy? Have you been keeping up your appointments with immigration? Yes. How do I know these aren't photocopies of a forged document? Hey. Yo, yo! Yo, yo. Go get her, tiger. How long you been seeing Earl for? I don't know, about a year. He only meets me at the hotel. All I know that he was excited about getting out of the growing for good. He said it was his last crop. I find out you're lying to me, I'm going to shake this fat fuck, I'm gonna come back, I'm gonna fuckin' kill you and whoever the fuck you're working with. You get that? Do you get that? I'm not lying. Fuck, my neck is so tense. Need a fuckin' massage with a happy ending. It's cheap. What's the matter, why you so sad? So what's the plan now? The plan. We watch. We watch this fleabag hotel and see if little vaginita's boyfriend shows up. He just might be our perp. Just in time. Hey, Skeezy. You wanna get up, you wanna knock it down? I'll knock it down, buddy, gimme two 10 packs, percs. This your new partner? Yeah. - I got some killer Kush. - Right. - You a cop? - Yeah. You need any weed? Yeah. What do you need, man? I got the killer. There you go. See ya. Hey! You just gave me one, motherfucker. Don't fuck with me. Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I'm not fucking with you. I just, I had it. See you later. What happened to your leg? What? What happened to your leg? I was eating pussy. You know, all those plants at Earl's house, they weren't cut, or pruned, or dried, they were just raw plants. What do you think about me looking around a little bit, see if I can find somebody's trying to sell them? You got two hours. I'll meet you back at the boat. Good morning, Centennial Hospital. Hi, do you have an Alexis Caine in? She was admitted this morning. One moment, sir. She was released at eleven. Thanks. It's Alexis, leave a message. Hey, babe, here's your phone. You heard of anybody robbing any growers at all lately? No. Vietnamese guys that sold you the store, any chance they've got fuckin' surveillance or something going on on the street here? No. Bikers come by and shake you down? - You okay, dude? - Yeah. The biggest problem is the cops. They surveil people coming in and out of the store. I tell them don't park on the street, park in here, I got cameras, but they know better so they park out there and the cops follow them and put a magnetic tracking device under their thing and goodbye. I've been waiting around for Earl, I was supposed to give him this phone but I don't know where the fuck he is. He's dead. What? Ah, Christ. Oh, dude. I gotta go. All right. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm so sorry. I can't do this anymore. Can we just go now? Shh. Look, I'm packed. I packed up our shit, we'll just go. Let's leave town now. Come with me, okay? I gotta find out who killed Earl and then we can go. Yeah? - Okay? - I need to feel safe. - You're safe. - I don't feel safe. - Tell me what I can do. - Leave with me. I can't, I can't leave. Not yet. I can't do this anymore. I won't do this anymore. I'm sorry. I've got a surprise for you. Recognize those? I told you the cops had them. Check this out, so two days ago, a cop pulls me over, that's one of the three cops from Christmas, tells me that they've been trying to sell these three bags on their own and they can't 'cause it's too heaty or whatever, don't have the connections. So he gives me all this Kush back, tells me to sell it and they want half. This isn't the cop that was hunting me down, is it? No, it's the bald-headed titan guy. Your guy's the wandering poet dude. Crazy, right? It's fucking crazy. Earl was killed. Some thugs. I need you to find 105 Kush plants. - They killed him? - Yeah. Okay. Hello. Bernie? Your hearing is in two days, Bernie. It's Tuesday at one o'clock. I would recommend that you consult a lawyer and try not to cowboy this shit... ♪ Space to Bakersfield ♪ Are you listening ♪ Are you willing ♪ Are you able ♪ Two hits in digital ♪ Space to Bakersfield ♪ Space to Bakersfield ♪ Are you listening ♪ Are you listening Who was at you girl's place in the van when I pulled up? Her husband, her ex-husband. Are they living together? No. Are you sure? Yeah. This friend I was talking to yesterday was telling me some cops you might know stole 106 pounds of Kush in three hockey bags. Oh yeah? He's saying that this guy Vincent brought the bags back to him, wants him to sell the weed for him. - Yo. - Hey. What the fuck? What's he doing here? - Merry Christmas, Zack. - Yeah, Merry Christmas. What the fuck is going on? Open your mouth, open wide, stay still, open it wide. Say ah. Ah. Say hiya, hiya, hiya, say it. - Ha, ha. - Hiya, hiya, hiya. Who brought you these bags? Santa, huh? Vincent. Who else? The young kid with the red hair. Anybody else? I think the black guy was driving. See, next time you just fuckin' tell me. Don't make me fuckin' ask so many questions, all right? When I ask you a question you give me the fucking details, all right? Don't make me ask, and ask, and ask. We're part of the team now, right? Blow your fucking nuts off. How's this deal supposed to go down? They want 100 grand within the week. I'll just call him when I get all the cash. I want you to call Vincent. You got his number, right? Yeah, I have his number but he's not fuckin' around. I need the money. Okay. Just pick up your fuckin' phone and call Vincent. Tell him you have the money and you need to see him right here, right now. Pick up your phone. And you find out if he's got those 105 plants. Just call him. Tell him you've got the dough. That's right. See, that's working together. It's Zack. So, good news, I just sold the bags, I've got your money. Where are you? I'm at the parkade on Union in Chinatown. Meet you there. You got the money in your pocket, what? Holy fuck, what? Fuck, I had a buyer lined up and he didn't fuckin' pull through. - Really? - I'm sorry. - Really? - I'm sorry, Vincent. I'm gonna meet him a little later. Shut up. Where the fuck does this leave me? Now what do I do? Put your head down there, look at that. Yeah, you don't wanna get Vincent mad. What happened? You did good. Good job. He doesn't have the plants. Now he wants all the cash. All 200 grand and he wants it in the next 48 hours or he's gonna stuff me in the bags and bury me in some fucking peat bog. Oh yeah, the peat bog. I know that peat bog very, very well. You did good, you're on point, on mission. Now what you need to do is find out who's got those whole Kush plants. What are you gonna do with the hockey bags? We're keeping them. Collateral. I'm sorry. You sit on the bags. Yo, forget about Vincent. Keep your phone on. How's it going? Hey, good. The thing you were telling me about the cops following people, did you get a look at them? No, the owner of the restaurant told me. Did he say what they looked like at all? Goofy and Donald Duck, how the fuck am I supposed to know? You got a spot to hold on to a couple of bags for me? Will you listen to me? This is the cops' last chance to settle old scores. Anybody on their shitlist is gonna get charged or ripped off. So get your girlfriend and get the fuck out of here or you're gonna end up like Earl. Grab one of those. This bear trap thing is coming down on you, brother. You should've left town a year ago like I told you. - Yo. - I've got some good news. I sorted it all out. You got the license. Oh yeah? What's the catch? Is that you? Is that you out there? - No. - You fuckin' with me? What do you mean, am I there? Fuck. Hey. What's your name again? Ricardo. You got any really good weed? Really high-end sativa? No, I just got the heavy stuff. Sativa, no. But, hey, I got some of this. Help yourself. - Are you sure? - Sure, go ahead. This is good. All right. Hey, do you know of anybody trying to unload some full plants? No, that'd be pretty weird, huh? No, I haven't seen any. Yeah, weird. You know of any grow-ops being broken into lately? Grow-ops being robbed? No, I haven't, not here, not that I know of. Frank? You know, Carter, he's a good kid. I've known him since he was a little boy. He would never hurt anybody. - Not at all, no. - No. I told you not to come here. Where the fuck is Mark? Where does he live? Why? - Where does he live? - Why do you need to know? Because he just killed Frank. You tell him where the spots are? You tell him where everything is? Fuck. Hey, I want you to cut all those plants down right now. - Wait, what? - Cut them down! I'm gonna call you in two minutes, okay? Shit. Hey, it's Mark, the ex-husband. He just killed this friend of mine, Frank. I've got this other warehouse and he's on this way down there. It's at the corner of Brandon and Hewitt. Don't fuck this up. Don't do any hotdogging, I need this guy in one piece or I'm fucked. Vince? Yeah. The guy who electrocuted Earl Freeman, he just murdered another grower. His name is Mark White. He's heading over to take down another warehouse right now and I need you to catch him at it and bust his fuckin' ass, okay? You got anything real, Bernie? Anything real I can use? This is legit. It is, huh? Look, I'm not gonna follow one of your fuckin' barnyard hunches here, all right? Do your job, gimme something I can use, I need pictures, something, Bernie. I'm doing you a favor, man. Listen to me, you useless fucking cripple, you're not doing me any favors, okay? Well, maybe I should take those three bags of weed and take them down to Sarge, that'd make my life fuckin' easier, wouldn't it? Wouldn't it, huh? Bernie, where the fuck are my hockey bags? I'll give you the bags once you bust this guy. It's the corner of Brandon and Hewitt, northeast corner. And you got the bags, right, Bernie? 'Cause I'll tell you something, we're not going anywhere unless you have the fuckin' bags. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, where you at? Come on! You know why they make you wait a year for divorce to go through, Carter, huh? It's 'cause the people are still usually fucking. She's makes a good partner, bro. I didn't even have to hit the bitch to tell me where the junkie lived. Okay, buddy. What, no! Fuck! Fuck you! Gimme a sec here. Carter, you fuckin'. Fuck you, you fuckin' piece of shit. What? Hey, you gotta help me, man. He's fuckin' crazy, dude. He's fuckin' trying to kill me, man. Shut up, I'm trying to save your ass. Easy, easy does it, Carter, come on. You gotta help me. Carter, listen to me. You fuckin' piece... Put the gun down! Put it down. Put it down or I'll blow your fuckin' head off. What the fuck have you done? What do you mean, what the fuck have I done? It's an accident. That's no accident. - Yeah, it's an accident. - Yeah, right. Like my leg in your bear trap. Bernie, you know I didn't do that. It was your grow-op. No, it was my grow-op but it wasn't fuckin' bear traps. Put your hands on your head. Bernie, this is an accident. - No, no accident. - He fell into the... I saw you fuckin' do it. Put your fuckin' hands on your head. Don't fuckin' move. Don't you fuckin' move. Bernie, he was dead when you got here. Shut up. Shut up. You didn't see anything. Trust me. You never met me. You don't know me, you got it? Bernie, trust me. Shut the fuck up. You don't know me. Here's your guy, your grower, take him. The killer's underneath the panel, he's dead, he's fried. I gotta go. Where are the bags? We'll do this later. Bernie, where are the fuckin' bags? - Later, we'll do it later! - Yeah? Okay, all right, cut him loose. I gotta go! Ah man. Now, there were 196 OG Kush plants missing from that chop room. Do you know what happened to any of them? No. You ever seen that gold Caprice cruising around the warehouse? No. Have you ever seen him before? No. So, Mr. Holmes, when you showed up at the warehouse, just tell me what happened. Take me back through. I came through the warehouse, I went into the back part of the room, he jumped me from behind, we got into a fight there. The fight spilled out into the main part of the warehouse. I didn't know what to do, I went the door. When I went to the door, your cop was there, yes. And then what happened? Detective Watts, we agreed to participate in a non-custodial interview, not an interrogation. Now your evidence situates the deceased in two identical robberies. My client was lucky enough to escape without being another victim in this string of murders. I secured Carter, I cuffed him. And then I discovered Mark White's body lying underneath the electrical panel. It looked like he had been electrocuted. An accident? As far as I could tell. And have you ever seen that other officer before today? Never. And that detective, Detective Bernie Coulson, you've never seen him before? He's already answered the question. Counselor, you got a minute? Hang tight. He said you'll be subpoenaed as a witness in Detective Coulson's murder trial in a few weeks. So we got a suspended detective in the middle of a crime scene, where 196 OG Kush plants are missing, and a dead body. You know what I think, Bernie? I think you didn't accept that compensation package for your leg because you wanted to go back to work and you figured you could make more money ripping off the growers and that you and Mark White were partners. And that somewhere you've got those 196 pot plants. And not to mention the quarter million dollars worth of weed in them hockey bags. Yeah, I don't know if I should be calling you. All right, man, here's the keys. I saw this guy and he seems really suspicious and he's loading a bunch of garbage bags and hockey bags into his SUV. What? Well, it smells like marijuana, yeah. He had a shaved head and a black jacket and a ski hat. Yeah, okay, just trying to help. Okay, all right, thanks. We found the plants from Frank Becker's grow house in Mark's van, but we didn't find any of Carter's weed from the warehouse. Mark White was working alone robbing grow-ops and then killing the growers. The guy's a psychopath. When's the last time you seen Vincent around the warehouse? Call my lawyer. Yeah, Sarge, got the 100 pounds in the hockey bags. And we have 196 plants. I'm bringing Vincent in now. What do you want to do about Bernie? Cut the bear loose. Here's the license. It's good for 200 plants. You can fire things up with the Italian kid. If you don't want to do anything then I'll find someone else and take 10%... This license is useless. In two weeks the government's going to announce that it's totally legal. - Says who? - Says me. I'm working for a pharmaceutical company and training them. They're already starting a farm, it's a government contract. So why didn't you tell me that? Because I can't bring you on board. You have to go! Don't you get it? How have to go. You pushed it too far. Look, I know this friend in San Miguel and he runs a language school. You could teach English. You want me to teach? I want you to get in that cab and go. I lost fuckin' everything. The cops won't let this slide. I'm sorry. Will you come and visit me? Of course. Good thing you taught me how to make tacos. Jesus fuckin' Christ.
