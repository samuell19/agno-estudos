Thank you. Thank you for coming. Thank you for... Thank you for leaving your homes. (audience laughs) My name's David Byrne. -(audience cheering) -Thank you. I can't take any credit for that. I had no choice in the matter. I read something, well, kinda surprising and amazing the other day. I read that babies' brains have hundreds of millions more neural connections than we do as adults, and that as we grow up, we lose these connections. So I wondered to myself, what does this mean? (scatter laughter) Does this mean that babies are smarter than we are and that as we grow up, we get stupider and stupider until we reach a... a plateau of stupidity? Which is where most of us are now. Well... ♪ ♪ what happens is... we keep the connections that are useful to us, and, yes, there's a process of pruning and elimination, and we get rid of a lot of the others until the ones that are left define who we are as a person, who we are as people. They define how we perceive the world, and the world appears to make some kinda sense to us. And maybe round about that time we start asking ourselves various questions like, "Who am I? "What do I want? -"How do I work this? -(laughter) "What are those people doing over there? "Should I be doing that? "Are they looking at me? "Are they like me? "Should I go over and talk to them? Huh, maybe not." Try to figure this out, wondering if there's, you know, wondering if there's a logic to it and wondering if it's supposed to make some kinda sense.

I was familiar with a different Dada artist who also wrote nonsense poetry. His name was Kurt Schwitters, and he recorded one of these in 1932. It was called the "Ursonate," the primeval sonate. Schwitters and some of the others in the... this group were, well... they were using nonsense to make sense of a world that didn't make sense. To help explain a little bit what that means, here's a little bit of the "Ursonate." (speaking nonsensical syllables) (electronic music playing) (continues speaking nonsensical syllables) It goes on like that for 40 minutes. (audience laughs) It'd be a different kinda movie. The world they were trying to make sense of, it... Yes, it was pretty crazy. Uh, there had recently been an economic crash. Uh, the Nazis were coming to power. This is 1932, and quite a few of the countries they lived in were sliding into fascism. The Dada artist Hugo Ball said that their artistic aims were to remind the world that there are people of different, independent minds beyond war and nationalism who live for different ideals. (audience cheering) Hugo Ball wrote the words to this next song.

(audience laughs) I spent some of my money on a Sony Trinitron color television. The screen was about that big, but it was, it was state-of-the-art in those days. I must have still been a little bit, a little bit isolated, still trying to figure things out, and I had an idea that to help with that, I should watch more TV. (audience laughs) Okay, I saw the TV as being a kind of window, and I would see the hopes and dreams and aspirations and foibles of my fellow Americans, and I might learn something about myself as well, and maybe, maybe I'd get some answers to those questions that I was asking myself earlier. And I wondered to myself, did the TV contain those millions of lost connections between me and them and them and me?

It kinda sounds like the singer is not sure how he feels about everybody coming over to his house. And you can sense, although he never says it in the song, you can sense that he's thinking, "When are they gonna leave?" (audience laughing) In contrast, their version... And this was kind of a profound thing for me. They didn't change a single lyric. They didn't change the melody, and yet their version has a completely different meaning. Their version seems to be about welcome, inviting everyone over, inclusion. I kinda liked their version better, and I didn't know how they did it. Unfortunately, I am what I am. (audience laughing) (audience cheering, applauding) Not sure how to take that applause. -(audience laughing) -(man yells) We have people from many parts of the world in this band.

In 2016, just before the election, I went to Charlotte, North Carolina, to encourage people to register if they weren't registered, to encourage them to vote if they were registered. -The election was in a couple of days. -(applause) We do something similar here. We've partnered with an organization called HeadCount. They have a table in the lobby. They'll register you instantly, instantly, no matter what state you're from. We also did a thing called a pledge. The pledge consists of a clipboard and a piece of paper, and I would go up to people and go, "Are you gonna vote tomorrow? "Will you sign this piece of paper saying that you're gonna vote tomorrow?" This is not a legal document. It was just a piece of paper, but it's been shown that when people put their name down, it was like they'd made a promise to themselves, and it increased the odds that they would actually turn up. The turnout for that election was the best it had been in decades. (audience cheering, applauding) Fifty-five percent of us turned out to vote. (laughter) Okay. Local elections are another matter. Local elections, the average turnout is 20%. To give you a visual idea of what 20% looks like, here are 20% of the people in this theater. Here they are. These are the ones that vote in local elections. The ones up top are waving and laughing because, well, they just decided your future and the future of your children. But you guys seem to be okay with that. (scattered laughter) Here's another little bit of information. The average age of the people who turn out to vote in local elections, that 20%, is 57 years of age. -Whoo! -Oh! There we go. Hey. (laughs) Congratulations. (audience laughs) Okay, yeah, but 57? Climate change, right? Kids... you're fucked. We gotta do better than 20%, really. (cheering) Local elections do make a difference. We gotta do better than 55% too.

So a friend of mine came to the show, and we were talking backstage, and he asked me, "Are you really playing all that music that we hear, "or do you have, you know, playback and tracks and stuff like that?" And I said, "I have nothing against playback and tracks, "but in this case everything you hear "coming off the stage is being played by this incredible band." (audience cheering, applauding) David: Whoo! (cheering continues) I figured other people were maybe thinking the same thoughts as my friend was thinking, so I've continued to tell this story, but it's not enough. Journalists and reporters will... they email, and would call my office, and they go, "I know what he says from the stage, "but really? Really?" So I thought, "Okay, we have to put this matter to rest." To do that, I'm gonna introduce the band, and as I do so, you're gonna hear how the next song is put together right in front of your ears.

As you can see, we don't have any cables or wires attached to us in these shows, attaching to gear or equipment or any of those kinds of things. We're completely untethered. We can go wherever we like on the stage. It's very liberating. When I began to think about the show, I realized that, well, what we humans like looking at the most is, yeah, other humans. More than a bicycle, more than a beautiful sunset, and probably more than a bag of potato chips. So I thought about the show, and I wondered, "What if we could eliminate everything from the stage "except the stuff we care about the most? What would be left?" Well, it would be us, us and you, and that's what the show is.

(cheering) She sang it at the Women's March in Washington a few years ago. I was there. I wrote to her a little bit afterwards and asked what she would think of a white man of a certain age singing this particular song. The reason'll be clear in a minute. She loved the idea. She said the song is for everyone, that it's for humanity. (applause) It'll be obvious the song is a protest song. It's also a requiem, a requiem for lives that have been senselessly taken. I also see the song as being about possibility, the possibility of change, not just in the imperfect world out there but in myself, too. I also need to change.

The writer James Baldwin said, "I still believe "that we can do with this country something that has not been done before." And this, this from a man who has suffered lifelong oppression and discrimination. Despite all that's happened and despite all that's still happening I think there's still a possibility. We're a work in progress. We're not fixed. (vocalizing) Our brains can change. Maybe those millions of connections in our brains that got pruned and eliminated when we were babies somehow get kind of reestablished, only now instead of being in our heads, they're between us and other people. Who we are is thankfully not just here, but it extends beyond ourselves through the connections between all of us. -(vocalizing continues) -(audience cheering) ("One Fine Day" playing) ♪ Saw the wandering eye inside my heart ♪ ♪ Shouts and battle cries from every part ♪ ♪ I can see those tears ♪ ♪ Every one is true ♪ ♪ When the door appears ♪ ♪ I'll go right ♪ ♪ Through ♪ (vocalizing) ♪ In a small, dark room ♪ ♪ Where I will wait ♪ ♪ Face to face I find I contemplate ♪ ♪ Even though a man is made of clay ♪ ♪ Everything can change ♪ ♪ That one fine ♪ ♪ One fine day ♪ ♪ Then before my eyes ♪ ♪ Is standing still ♪ ♪ I beheld it there, a city on a hill ♪ ♪ I complete my tasks one by one ♪ ♪ I remove my masks when I am done ♪ ♪ Then a peace of mind fell over me ♪ ♪ In these troubled times I still can see ♪ ♪ We can use the stars to guide the way ♪ ♪ It is not that far ♪ ♪ That one fine ♪ ♪ One fine day ♪ ♪ Hope ♪ -♪ Oh, I have hope ♪ -(vocalizing) ♪ I have hope ♪ -(vocalizing) -♪ I have hope ♪ ♪ I have hope ♪ -(vocalizing) -♪ I have hope ♪ ♪ I have... ♪ ♪ Hope ♪ -(clap) -(music ends) (cheering) Whoo!
