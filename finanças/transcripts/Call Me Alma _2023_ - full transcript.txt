There are many kinds of whores. The prayerful, they like to get down on their knees. The greedy, they snatch their colleague’s customers. The sex-crazed, they're obsessed with sex. Those who believe it’s just a job, nothing personal. Those who keep saying it’s only temporary. And those who keep falling in love with their clients. They keep hoping for a happily ever after. I harbor no such illusions. I know that once our customers get on top of us, there’s no difference between us. Most of us use aliases. Daisy. Mabel. Precious. Not me. I use my real name. I'm Alma. Hi, Jun! Good evening ma’am! I love that you’re always on time! Of course! Time is gold. What’s a whore anyway? These days, can you tell us apart? If I sat next to you, could you tell I’m a whore? Is it hereditary? Fate? A curse? Or just like any random thing? You, you’re destined to become an engineer. You, a teacher. And you there, you’ll become a... whore. Chona. My best friend. My go-to when someone asks for a threesome. Tonight might be my last. Calvin’s petition for my visa is about to be granted! I can’t wait! Chona didn't want to become an entertainer in Japan. Contracts were short and there were too many horror stories. So she agreed to marry an old American who’ll bring her to the U.S. I need a new partner. She used to accompany me for threesomes. I was really comfortable with her. Hi. - I missed you. - How are you doing? Did you order? I have three regulars. I have a pet name for each one. Meet Mr. Lopez. I call him Tiger Joe. Tiger Joe is a rich lawyer. He’s into role playing. He gets off on seeing me become different women. Is it your first time? I like it when you’re in pain. He likes the taste of blood when we kiss. He likes big mirrors where he can watch himself. When I look at our reflection, everything seems like a fantasy. It's like make believe. It makes him feel powerful. Like he’s "the man". I let him do as he pleases. As long as the pay pleases me. I added a little extra. A few more punches and I can buy my dream car. This one’s Mr. JC, whom I call Horse. He’s hung, but boring in bed. He’s a premature ejaculator. If this were a horse race, he’d be a winner. He gets to the finish line before everyone else. Thank you! I’m sorry. It’s okay. It’s cute actually, how excited you always are. See you again. Bye! And Miguel. I call him Puppy Dog. He’s head over heels in love with me. He's always following me around. He waits until closing time. That’s why he falls asleep during his classes. He’s broke, so I give him freebies. Take off your clothes. It’s unfair to you. I have no money. Did I ask you to pay? I make plenty with the others. Besides, you’re sweet. Now take it all off. It’s not like we haven’t done this before. Each time is like the first time. Because I love you. Love is such a drag. Come on. - You want me to undress you? - No! I’ll do it. You’re all grown up now! There you go again. You act as if you’ve never seen me naked! Each time is like my first. That’s why I don’t fall in love. It makes you stupid. - Really? You don't drink? - Yeah. Even if my customer insists. The ladies drink at the bar? There’s no alcohol in it. I don’t do drugs either. I do smoke sometimes though. I never want to lose control. That’s the thing I hate the most. Losing control over myself. Am I the first whore you’ve seen who doesn’t drink, or do drugs? I also don’t do those things. I drink, sometimes. Just for show. I also don't do drugs. Then we’re the same! I’m not his girlfriend. But neither am I his whore. We’re not together. We’re simply friends with benefits. - How much is this? - Fifty pesos sir. Okay, I’ll have one. Thanks! Wow. Thank you. - Thank you Sir. - Let's go. You like it? The year was 1999. The end of a millennium, they said. A thousand years. They said the world will end on New Year's Day. Planes will fall from the sky. Phones will stop working. The lights will go out. Thank you. In an interview, the leader of the group promised to explain the cause and the importance of their resolve. In Tagaytay, a group of elderly people had been camping out at the top of the mountain. That’s where they’ll wait out doomsday, they said. I don't really care. Everyday feels like the end of the world for me. I’ll bring you home. Let’s get a cab. No. I still feel like walking around. Okay, I’ll join you then. No. I’d rather be alone. Are you sure? Yes, I’m good. Bye! I love you. Okay. Are you a dog? You keep following me. Who are you? Are you the wife of Tiger Joe? Alma, I’m Sheila. I’m your mother. - I don’t have a mother! - You do. Twenty-three years have passed since I sold you. You can't fool me. You just need money, so bark up another tree. I was also a bar girl. But my days were numbered. I was past 30 when I had you. I wanted to have an abortion but my fear in God stopped me. So I gave birth to you. I didn’t want your life to be as messed up as mine, so I gave you up. I thought that you’d live a better life than me. Turns out you were right. Look at me now. You said you sold me. So, you made money from me? I needed to live. And since I was giving you up, I thought it was only fair that I got paid. So why’d you look for me? Were you hoping that I’d love you and care for you now that I have money? I don’t need you. I’m tired of stories. Every night I hear lots of them. And the story that I hate the most is my own. My visa is approved! Hello, America! You’re spending Christmas there? Yes. That asshole Calvin played me. He said I wasn’t approved. I bawled my eyes out! Then, he took it back, said he was joking. My visa has been approved. I wanted to punch him in the face, but I was too happy. So I gave him a freebie all night long. So, what about you? Will you be alright on your own? I’ll look for your replacement. Right now I’m just so happy for you. You should be! Sorry. It’s okay. My wife says I always leave her hanging, so now she wants to leave me. I’ve tried everything. I take zinc and magnesium daily. I used thick condoms just to dull the sensation. I even made an altar and put saints on it to quell my excitement. I tried both the pause-squeeze and the stop-start techniques. Nothing worked. I get a glimpse of my wife’s side boob, and I start cumming. There must be a cure. I think it started when I was barely in my teens. Whenever I masturbated, I worried that my father would catch me. So I learned to do it fast, and got used to it. The end of the world is coming, but I’ll cum even sooner. Don’t lose hope. Wherever there’s a dick, there’s hope. Why did you have him beaten up? I knew he’d tell on me. I asked you why? I want it to be just us. What are you talking about? You know what I do for a living. Your Puppy Dog is different. He’s been bragging that you’re his girlfriend. That's not true. But even if it were, what’s it to you? I don't know. I just thought he needed beating up. I don’t want you seeing him anymore, okay? No way. I’ll double your pay. Add it to your car fund. Let’s get started. Clock’s ticking. Sing to me. ♪ Won’t notice the time ♪ ♪ Won’t notice it passing by ♪ ♪ Even all through the night ♪ ♪ Look at me and hold my hand tightly ♪ ♪ Even all through the night ♪ ♪ Look at me and hold my hand tightly ♪ ♪ Even all through the night ♪ ♪ With you, it feels like forever ♪ ♪ Won’t notice the time ♪ ♪ Won’t notice it passing by ♪ ♪ Look at me and hold my hand tightly ♪ ♪ Won’t notice the time ♪ You sure you’re okay? We can still see each other. Secretly. Just don’t cut me off, please. I won’t. You’re not mad at me? I’m not. I love you. Okay. Wait a minute, stop here. Sheila? Sheila. Sheila, wake up. Sheila, wake up. Who are you, huh? Who are you? Why are you sleeping here? What am I doing here? Who are you? What are you planning to do to me? No! Who are you? Are you joking right now? Early onset Alzheimer's. Senile? I’m not senile! Let’s go already. She’ll just milk you dry. You’re still under observation. - You need a doctor. - I am not sick. Take this. Take care of her. Up to you if you want to get sick. Just leave me out of it. Let’s look for your father. You’re something else. Now you talk about my father. If it’s true that I have Alzheimer’s, I want to see him again before it’s too late. And why is that my problem? I don’t even care about him. Jun! A magnitude of 6.8 earthquake hit parts of Luzon with the epicenter located near Lingayen, Pangasinan, killing six people... News of death ushers Christmas in. A bus fell off the mountain, 19 dead. Earthquake in Masbate, five dead. A group of teenagers in Cebu played Russian roulette. A game to celebrate the end of the world. Three died. Death visited even this shitty bar. There was a shootout. Two died. Our manager was implicated. The bar was shut down. At least for now. Are the people of the world being culled? What will happen to those like me? I doubt that heaven has a place for us. Chona wrote to me. She said she was happy in America. At long last, she found happiness. Finally Horse’s wife got pregnant. She’s not leaving him anymore. Horse couldn’t be happier. He cums even faster now. Tiger Joe and Puppy Dog have made peace. Don’t ask me how it happened, I don’t know. Maybe it’s one of the mysteries of the end of the world. Out of all the Christmas carols, I hate Jingle Bells the most. As if it snows here in the Philippines! And what else are bells supposed to do but jingle? You got me. I agree. We’re going to look for your father? Sure. If that will get you off my back. Thank you. What for? For agreeing to help. So, where do we start looking? Ah... in Bataan. Shit, I thought we’d be looking here in Manila. We can spend a night there. Why don’t we greet the New Year there? You think I’m rich? The bar is closed anyway. You don’t have to show up. Let’s go. Do you know where in Bataan we’ll find him? In a resort. But I don’t really remember where. You got this all figured out. That’s where we met, your father and I. He always brought me coconuts. I’m not sure if he was a fisherman or a dock worker. But he told me that he’s the one who’ll climb the tree just to get the coconuts. Where are we going? To Bataan. Ah... to Bataan. Bataan. You peed? I peed. I peed. It’s okay, don’t worry about it. We’ll cover it. I peed. I peed. - Cheer up. - I peed. I peed. I peed... It’s okay. Don’t worry about it. I peed. I peed. Cheer up. It will dry, okay? It’s okay... We’re going to Bataan? Yes, Bataan. How much? Ma’am, here’s the key. Who’s that? That’s Mr. Cruz. The owner’s son. I see. Come, go change. You stink. Go change. You stink. I want the green one. You’re already wearing it. This one's fine. We’ll stay for two days. If we don’t find that Badong, we leave. I want to be back in Manila before New Year’s. Excuse me, do you know anyone named Badong? Sorry, but there’s no Badong here. He stayed here for a long time. For about 20 years. He’s around the same age as me. Try the other side of town. Maybe he’s there. How young? Three months. I remember a Badong who used to deliver fish. That must be him! He always smelled fishy. But he must be 80 years old now and moved to Manila. - It can’t be him. - Thanks. What else do you remember about that asshole? Why are you calling him names? You don’t even know him. So what else do you remember? Butterflies. He likes giving me butterflies. What? Ugh! That’s not even helpful! What, we look for someone who’s into butterflies? Sheila! Your information is so random, it’s useless. Are we gonna look for someone who’s into butterflies? Hey! Stop! Whatever. Sheila! Sheila. Are you okay? Come on, let's go back to the resort. Come. Hold onto me. Come on. Slowly. Do you feel better? That's your room. This here is mine. Why not share a room? Come on. Okay. Alma... Alma? Why? Can you still accept me as your mother? We’re here to find my father. But can’t you accept me? I bet it would feel good to hear you call me “Mom." Go to sleep. You need enough rest. Were they good to you, the ones who raised you? What were they like? My memories are getting fewer and fewer. I’m becoming forgetful. But there’s one memory that I never want to forget. What’s that? The little time we were together. Before I sold you. You were always in my arms. I was breastfeeding you. You had such an appetite. You’d bite my nipple when I ran out of milk. Let’s sleep. We’ll start early tomorrow. There was a couple looking to adopt a child. They were well-off and religious. Always going to church. I told myself that I’d give you to them. At least my child will be close to heaven. Heaven? Were they good to you? How are they? I’m asking you a question. I ran away from them. Before I turned 13. I don’t want to talk about it. Continue your story. I'd rather not. It’s giving me a headache. Who named me Alma? You or them? Me. It means soul. I get it. You sold your soul. Nope. I wouldn’t say that. Where do you live now? Do you have a husband? My head is throbbing. You sound like the cops with your questions. Have you ever been arrested by the police? How do you make a living? By loitering in the streets, waiting for a customer. I earn enough. They used to call me the catcalling whore. Shit! Shit! You’re the champ! Thank you. He frequents here. Do you remember my Badong? The guy I was with before? Badong? Sorry, it really doesn’t ring a bell. Do you know anyone named Badong? I don’t know. Sorry. Try asking over there. I don’t know any Badong. Try asking somewhere there. Are you remembering things accurately? We’ve searched all over. What if it’s not Bataan? Could be. Could be? So you’re not sure? I know it’s here. But you’re not sure? Damn it. Maybe Badong isn’t real too. Was there really a Badong? I knew it! There’s no Badong. You made him up! A bunch of guys screwed you and you don’t even know which of them is my father. Liar! You wasted my time! I’m not a liar! No, you're a liar! You’re worthless as a mother. You’re a worthless daughter! You pushed me out, that's all. You wouldn’t be here if not for me. I wish I had a different mother! I wish I had a different daughter! Whore! Whore! You're a damn whore! Damn you! No more! Don’t hit me. I’m always being beaten up. Who did? My mother keeps on beating me up. She always found a way to hurt me everytime she got drunk. She’d always beat me, lock me, or tie me up. Then one day, Jaime came into my room. I was 15. Who’s Jaime? The man she was shacking up with. He raped me. He raped me but my mom got angry at me instead. I was a flirt, she said. She was really angry. That’s when she started selling me to many other men, to our neighbor, any man. She made me a whore. Sometimes she wouldn't even charge for it. But she failed. He never stopped. Other men used me. But so did Jaime. All of them made me a whore. They ruined me. They ruined me and made me a whore. And when you came into my life, I decided. I eagerly want you out of my life because I am so scared. So scared... My mind is exhausted, I am very scared. I told myself, no... No. I need to let you go. I didn’t want to become my mother. Not to you. What my Mom did to me was beyond any pain. I’m afraid I might do it to my child, I don’t want to do the same. I gave you up because- I’ll stop. I’ll stop. My head is throbbing. Stop it... Quick! I don’t have enough time. - I’ll do it, I’ll do it. - Go ahead. Oh, man. Oh... God. I added a little extra. And you can stay another day for free. Consider it my Christmas gift to you. Thank you. Alma, can I kiss you? By the way, how’s your senile mother? Thank you for this! This is an early breakfast. You went out last night? On the prowl again, I bet. There are bills to pay. I want to keep my car fund intact. I have a surprise for you. What surprise? Hey, what’s that? Christmas gift? Oh no, I didn’t get you anything! It’s okay. A dress? It’s so pretty. It’s my favorite color! - What do you think? - Looks good on you, Sheila. You’re pretty. I bet you were a hit with the customers when you were young. Naturally. What’s your forte? Everything. But my specialty was my sweetness. In sex, once they finish, that’s it. What kept them from coming back is my never ending sweetness. Among your regulars, did you have a favorite? I did. One of them walked with a cane he didn’t need. One wore glasses even if his eyes were fine. I once had a suitor. He pays whenever we have sex. He was loaded but he didn’t flaunt it. He always had red roses for me. He made me feel like I was worthy of being loved. What happened to him? He disappeared. Vanished without a trace. He just stopped coming. Never heard from him again. It took me months to get over him. Another one always asked me to sing for him, on the bed. He once had a girlfriend who went to Japan as an entertainer. I don’t even know any Japanese words. I knew a line from a Chinese version. That was during the Christmas season, so I sang like this... Jingle bells, jingle bells. Jingle all the way. O, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey! I went along with him. What did you do after you sold me? I went straight away to a restaurant and ordered a whole leg of ham. I stuffed myself to push you out of my thoughts. Did you think about me the next day? No. I had to open my legs for business. You know the time you suddenly popped into my mind? When business slowed down. I became a has-been. That’s when you started living in my head rent free. I was thinking, where could you be? What happened to you? I couldn’t get you out of my head. I want to be a mother to her who was never a mother to me. I’ll take care of her. But how can I be a mother when... I don’t even know what it’s like to be a daughter? Leave me when we get back to Manila. Why? Where are you going? It’s just... I want us to go our separate ways. Forget me. Nonsense. What's gotten into you, Sheila? You found me. Now you don’t want me? You’re leaving me again? I won’t allow it. When we get back to Manila we’re going to see your doctor. I don’t want that. No. You know, this illness has no cure. It’s only going to get worse. It’s probably a curse or karma. I don’t want to be a burden to you. I decide what I want and don’t want. You’re young. I’m done. You’re still on your way up. I don’t want to drag you down. Nobody’s dragging anybody down. Because they’re going high. Live your life. Don’t waste it on me. You’re not leaving and that’s it. I’ll take care of you. What will you do? Will you wipe my butt after I poop? Feed me and watch me throw everything up? Look for me each time I disappear? - No! I don’t want to! - I don’t care! - I do! - You’ll do as I say! We’ll stay together and you will see the doctor. End of discussion! No! I don’t want to! Tomorrow we look again for Badong. I saw a photo inside your bag. He’s real. We’ll find him. Are you sure you don’t know anyone named Badong? Yes. I don’t know him. Okay. Thank you. Come on. Wanna give up? If he’s not here, we’ll look elsewhere. I don’t know where else to look. If we don’t find him, so be it. We don’t need him. Tomorrow we go back to Manila. Wait. Let’s stay here. Let’s spend New Year’s here. It’s just one day. Okay. If that’s what you want. Come on. What if the customer can’t get it up? I ride him! If that doesn’t work, I leave. Go jack yourself off! Has anyone ever hurt you? I’ve had sadists and that’s okay with me. As long as they double the pay. Have you fallen in love with any of them? No. Never! I did. Always. All it took was them saying they loved me and my heart would melt. I love you too! I love you too! Don’t ever leave me. You’re funny, Mom. What’s wrong? It feels so good to hear you call me “Mom.” Come. Mom. Mom. You don’t have to do that. We’re leaving tomorrow. We can’t greet the new year with a dirty house. Just let me do it. She hasn't had an attack in a while. I hope she gets better. Sheila. I am Sheila. I’m Sheila. Who am I? Sheila... I am Sheila. Who am I? Who am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Sheila. Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Sheila. My name is Sheila. Where am I? I need to go to work. Open the door! Open the door, please? Not here. Here. Someone? Open the door, please? I’m afraid! Open the door. Mom? - Mom, what are you doing there? - I’m going inside. - That’s not our room. - No. It’s here! Why are you holding a bar of soap? What soap? There’s no soap? No! It’s mine! It’s mine! It’s mine! This is mine! It’s mine! It’s mine! I want to go inside. But I don’t know where. Mom, come. Come on. Come with me. You’ll help me? Yes. I will help you. - Mom, our room is here. - No! You’ll help me? Yes. Mom, come here. - Wait. - Come on. I don’t want to. I don’t want to. No. I don't want to. No, you’re going to lock me up. - What? Mom? - No! No, no! - I said I don’t want to. No. - Mom, come here. Come on. I don't want to. No! Not anymore. You’re going to lock me up, and beat me up! I don’t want to! No. I don’t want to anymore. I don’t want to. No. You’re going to confine me, lock me up! No, you’re going to lock me up. No. Mom, it’s me, Alma. I am your daughter. I am Alma. You’re going to lock me up with a bunch of other men... You’re evil! You’re up to no good! You’re evil. Mom, no. I am Alma. Alma? My Alma. Alma. Badong. I will name our daughter Alma. Have I already told you? About Alma? I am about to give birth. Look at my belly, it’s huge. I am pregnant. Badong, don’t leave me. Help me, Badong. Yes Mom, I will help you. - Come and get some rest. - Promise me we'll take care of Alma. My head hurts. Come now, Mom. Badong... Badong... Badong... Please don’t leave me, Badong! Badong... I should leave while I still recognize you my child. Before I forget who you are. Mom? Mom? Mom?! Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom... The bar re-opened, I went to work. New Year’s came and went, the world didn’t end. Tiger Joe stuck around. Soon we’ll role-play and have sex again. There’ll be a mirror for sure, where he can watch himself. Horse hardly comes around anymore. His wife died giving birth so now he’s a single dad. And Puppy Dog is still hopelessly in love with me. How are you? I love you. Okay. Chona hasn’t come home. She must be happy in America I still don’t have a car. I often think of Mom. It makes me sad. She came and went, just like that. Life goes on. My life, my happiness- it’s all up to me. After all is said and done, I’m still Alma. Whore.
