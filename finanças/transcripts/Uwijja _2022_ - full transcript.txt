Baby! I've missed you so much. You know, I rarely get to see you, eh? Everyone says that lately. Well, a few friends are coming for drinks later, gonna take foreign exchange students out. Gonna join when you're done? No, I'm leaving soon. Have dinner with my parents. Well, I can come over later? Have a repeat of yesterday? No, dude, I'm half shift today. Glen'll be here in five minutes, I told you already. - Hello? No, Dad, I'm gonna be late, sorry. Can you tell Mum, please? -No, don't... -John, you're not coming home? No, Ma, sorry. I made you chili con carne, your favorite! Ma, what should I do? Tell him to go fuck himself? If he tell me to stay late, I have to stay. Don't give me grief about it, all right? Okay. What time are you coming home? I'll leave it out. - Okay. -Margot. -Ooh, yum! Cheers! Cheers. Of course. Frisbee. Baseball. Stop messing with him. They're re-enacting this scene only Maltese people would know, don't worry about it. What film? Midnight Express. Shot all over Malta. The Maltese actor, think it was Zammit Cordina. - Yes, it was. - Was supposed to speak Turkish. I don't know. Basically, he blanked out when it came to his scene. So, the director told him to speak in Maltese because... No one will understand. It's not really a big deal. It's more like... I guess, people here got excited because, you know, their language is on Hollywood. Are many films shot here? Hmm... Yeah, but only foreign ones, really. Forget finding a local film in the cinema. - Let's play 21. - Yes! What's 21? The rules are simple. Everyone says a number from one to twenty-one. -One, two, three-- -We know how to count. The last person to say, "21", invents a rule. Any rule you want. No holds barred, all right? If someone says a number consecutively, -like one... -Two, three. ...it goes back to the other person. You'll get it as we go along. Shall we? Uwijja, what fun! Let's top up first. Oh! If you keep acting this cute, I'm gonna have to... Have to what? Hmm, well, let's go somewhere and you find out. Go to my car? Maybe we can find a better place. Hmm... my car's good. -Sixteen. -Seventeen. -Eighteen. -Twenty. -Twenty-one! Yes! Drink! Drink! Okay, now what? Okay, now you make a rule. So, you know how when we got to 19, the person has to drink? It has to be a rule like that. I don't know what to say. Um, okay, so how about I give you a rule for this round so that next round you'll be prepared. -Yeah, Okay. -No, that's not how it goes. Can't make up all the rules, that's not fair. Oh, go back to Sliema. Oh, burn! The rule of Leprechaun Joe. Yes! So basically, you have Leprechaun Joe at the edge of your glass. You take him, put him on your shoulder, you take a swig of your drink... ...and you put Joe back here. - So he doesn't drown. - Exactly. So he doesn't drown. If you don't drink, have to drink again to save him. What does "uwijja" mean? You said it before but in different contexts. I know what "mela" means, of course, right? But "uwijja" I can't understand, you say it all the time. "Uwijja" can be used in many different scenarios. - It's like a filler, I guess? - Three. - Four. - George used it... Five! Five! -Six! -Seven. Eight, nine, ten. George used it as an expression to say "everything goes", or "it's all the same". So when he said, "Uwijja, mhux xorta," it literally means it's okay, it all goes, -everything's the same. -It means it's acceptable. -Fifteen. -Sixteen. -Seventeen. -One sec. So, when George told Lisa he'd do the rule instead of you, he meant "uwijja" in the sense of, like, it's not part of the rules, but it's acceptable nonetheless. But you can also use "uwijja" in terms of disbelief, like, "Uijja, you're joking, Madonna!" -Didn't know you could use it like that! -No way, as if! You have a very confusing language. Are you not entertained? That's Gladiator. It was also shot in Malta, 1999. Actually, Oliver Reed died in a pub in Valletta. - Eighteen! - It's just a colloquial term... - Twenty! - All right, fine, fine! Twenty-one! Okay, so, when... we say nine we have to jump up and say, You have to drink! -I did! -No, again. You have to drink again! You forgot about Joe, the tiny man. He's right! -Again. Drink up. -You're an ass, is what you are. Happy? So what can "mela" be used for? Well, "mela" can either mean "of course", like, "Would you like to see my tits?" -Mmm. Mela, of course. -Gross. Ew. Or you can use it at the beginning of a sentence, like, " Mela, did you hear what happened with George and Lisa last night? Shut up! I mean, it's really like punctuation for us or it could even be sarcasm like, "George, give me 100." Oh, me ! a That means "fuck no". Yeah, nice! Thanks, uwijja, good enough. Now, you're 100% certified Maltese. -Meela. Me... mela! -Mela! - Mela. La. - Mela. Soph? Soph? Oh, nothing. John works too much sometimes, you know? What? He's still doing internship? Yea, does internship after uni and library, assignments, -he's writing some paper. -Crazy. And I say I don't have enough free time! Why doesn't he quit the internship? Well, I guess he wants a lot in one go, you know? Like he wants a masters from UCL, he wants a house, a start up by the time he is 25. - By the age of 25? - Hmm. That's ambitious. -I guess it's nice to want. -Hmm. Well, why doesn't he quit the bar then? Well, not everyone wants to live off mummy. Ouch, okay. I completely disagree. Until I'm married, or I'm earning a shit-ton of money, I'm my parent's burden. -Wow. Spoiled brat. -It means we both are. Yeah, we are. Want anything from the bar? Hmm-mm. I'm good. Thank you. Hey, babe. Give me a couple of shots, and I'll get out of your hair. Yeah, sure. -What? -It's for you. No, babe. Uwejja, come on, have some fun with us. Babe, this place is fucking packed. Are you mad at me? No. Last night kind of fucked up my morning. And I missed my assignment, so... C'mon. So what? Just ask for an extension... I gotta get back, let's talk later, okay? -Lisa? -Yeah? Do you all still live with your parents? You're gonna get quite the culture shock after tonight, my friend. Um... yeah, we all do. Can I ask why? I dunno why. We just do. George, why do you live with mummy? - Because I'm still at uni. - What a question! Cheapskate! Toby, why are you still living with daddy? It's round the corner from uni, and I'm saving up until I graduate. Save up? What about bills and student fees? -As if! -Man, Malta is really tiny! Doesn't even make sense to move. University is free here, we actually get paid to go. Stipend! Man, you know they made me pay it back last year? -What? Why? -Yeah, I mean... Did you show up? No, but, it's just... ...it's just rude! - Hey! - Woo-woo! Yeah! Guys, let's play a game of 21! Ooh! Yes! But this time, let's get it right. Okay? So! -One. -Two. Uh, three, twelve. -Twelve! Twelve! -I'm going! -Six! -Seven, eight! Eleven. Four, thirteen, bitch! Fourteen! - Ah! - Drink! Drink! Panama. Sixteen, seventeen. -Eighteen. -Nineteen. Twenty. Twenty-one! Havana, bitches! Hey. I'll meet you later, yeah? You wanna come sleep over? No, I'm swamped. Oh, f... fine. Take care of yourself, okay? Come on. Whoa! That's okay. That's okay. Let's go home, okay? And okay. - Bye. - Goodnight. See you for Mr Azzopardi's lesson tomorrow. If I wake up! Do you think I'm drunk? Ejja, come on, I'll take you to your flat. It's fine, I'll catch a taxi. Catch a taxi? I'm offering you a lift, ejja. -Can you even drive like this? -Like this? This is Malta, darling, not... Denmark. All right? -You don't trust me? -It's okay, I'll catch a taxi. Don't waste my money, ta. -Hey. -Hey, babe. You home? No, I just left. On the way home. Are you still out? No. No, as if. Got home at, like, twelve. Lisa wasn't feeling too good, so, so we called it an early night. I texted you ta ! Listen... we're okay? Don't worry about it. We're fine. I just had a horrible day. And Ben made me wash the toilets again. Jesus, why? 'Cause he hates me. Man, just quit. You're working way too much. Make sure you rest. I never get to see you. I'll get some sleep over the weekend. It'll be fine. Maybe I'll come over tonight. And get to watch you sleep. Look at your pretty face. Wait, your mum probably won't let us, eh? Probably not. -Unless we leave the door open. -Man, we're twenty! Anyway, whatever. Talk tomorrow? Yeah. Bye. Love you. Yeah. Goodnight. Goodnight. -Oh, Ma. - John... Where are you, are you still out? I'm on the way home. We finished late. What, you're still at work? Yeah, what can I tell you? We took long. Madonna, do you know what time it is? You need to catch some sleep, ta. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be fine. I'll get some sleep. But this is not a decent hour to come home, you know how much I worry about you. I can't even sleep! Yeah. I'm sorry, Ma, all right? It's not like I asked you to stay up for me. Ah, mela. You have to think about us as well, we need to go to work too. Yeah, Ma, but... What do you expect me to do? We finished late. You don't have work in the morning at least, so you can catch some sleep? Yep. I work at eight. What? Work? Again? Didn't you tell me you don't have work, madonna? John, why can't you tell them to change the hours a bit? Ma, man! These stupid questions. Gonna go home, get some sleep for a few hours, then wake up and go to the internship. It'll be fine. Can we just talk in the morning, please? Yeah, with you everything I ask is a stupid question. - All right. You know best. -Okay, Ma, all right. -All right, bye. Ciao, ciao... - There's food in the fridge... Fuck! Fuck you, asshole! Pfft. John, it was my turn. I'm late, Ma! My alarm didn't go off. Sorry. -How long will you be? -Another five minutes. Yes, all right, Dad. Will you be taking lunch? No, no time. You don't want me to make you something? No, I'll just eat something at the canteen. I'll make you something. Yeah, all right, Dad. Okay. - Ciao. - Bye. Bye. Well, a human brain has a mind of its own. If I were to... tell the brain to actually not do something, it will do it. Let me give you an example. Okay, uh, that's a wrap. Um, I'll see you all tomorrow. Thank you. John. Can I have a minute? Thank you, sir. My turn to give in the essay tomorrow. Yes. You're gonna have to give a presentation and everything! Yup! Fun times. Man, I don't even know what he's on about half of the time. Like, he'll go from... What was that? Soft commodities to, to this, to that, and it's like... I mean, maybe if you paid a little more attention -you could understand? -Uh? Well, maybe I don't pay attention so I can have you teach me later. Yeah, but... maybe I don't wanna teach. Maybe I just want to learn. I can teach you something. You're bad. Yes, and you're good. Come out tonight. It's gonna be me, Lisa, Toby. George is gonna come. I can't. I have work. Quit! Call in sick. You know I can't do that. Yes. And the reason was... Cambridge. You need to have more fun. Hey, I'll tell you what. I need to go to the library in an hour. Maybe, I could bring my notes, my assignment, and we could see why you're not getting on. Yes. Fun. Good. I got to go. I'll see you in an hour? -Yeah. Yeah. -Library? -Cool. -Save me a seat. Hey. What? Is Mum here? No, I don't think so. Give me five minutes, I'm trying to watch my show. What? Not eating with us? No, I have work in an hour. Does Mum know? I'll tell her, all right? All right. I want to watch my show. I wanna go to school. Meh. Hmm. Hmm. All right. All right. Ciao. Ciao! Hi, Mum. How was school? If you don't mind, just five minutes. Trying to watch my show. Jesus, can I just watch my show for five minutes? I'm annoyed 'cause I have five minutes before I go back to work for another six hours. Not gonna eat with us? I can't calm down. all this fuss because I left a few dishes? I'll wash them before I go, what's the big deal? When are we gonna have dinner like a normal family? You're working too much. I'm not working too much, working just enough actually. Don't act like you don't know what I'm working towards. Of course we know, but you're working too hard. -Just relax a bit. -I can't relax, Da! I have work, and my thesis, and my project. When do you want me to relax? I don't have time to relax. Yes, and we can help you. No, you can't, 'cause you can't afford it. Wish I could go to school and do my master's here, but I can't. I have to go abroad. For Judas's sake. What do you want from me, Da? I want us to have a family dinner once every now and then. I want you to be safe. I want you to be healthy and you need to rest. Great, can I go? I'm late. -What time are you coming home? -When I want! Fucking hell... Tonight, you're having fun! Hmm-mm. Morning. Morning. - Morning. - Did you sleep enough, John? A few hours. What? You have work again? Hmm? -Presentation. -At internship? Uni. I'm late, Mum. Is the car okay? It's fine. Till what time work? I don't know, might have a shift like, eight, so after. You're not having breakfast? I'll eat at the office. Sure you don't want me to make you something? I'm sure! Let me make you something. Mmm! -Ciao. Bye. Your phone. Thank you. Bye. For fuck's sake. Thank you all for coming. Sir, I'm so sorry, I overslept. -No, no, sir, sir. -Hey! I wasn't drinking. I work at a bar. John. Good day. How funny. Funny? Hello my love, what a surprise. Hey, Mum, all right? How are you? How's work going? Ah, no internship today. Thank God. Just Tuesdays and Thursdays. I'm on my way to a lecture and had a few minutes, so I thought I'd call. How nice. Thank you, my love. Listen, Ma. I'm sorry I snapped yesterday. I didn't mean to. I'm just really tired lately. I know, I know. It's just I worry a lot about you, you know? When are you gonna get some sleep? Hopefully tonight. I missed my assignment again this morning. Uh-huh... uh, now what? I don't know. Why don't you write to your teacher and tell him you have a lot on your plate? I'm sure he'll understand. No, no. No, no. Listen, I have to go. This class is starting and everyone's here. Okay, okay. Listen, quick question, will you be home for dinner? Oh yeah. My shift shouldn't last long, so I should be home by eight and we can have dinner. - What a surprise. - Lovely. We'll wait for you, mela. What do you want me to cook? I don't know, Ma, surprise me. I have to go. Look, there's chicken in the freezer. Or I can make a lovely cream pesto. I don't know, Ma, surprise me. Listen, I have to go. I'll surprise you, mela. Don't be late. Try to come earlier than eight o'clock, okay? Yes, yes, ciao, ciao. -Big hug. Love you. -Love you. Bye. That's what happens when you live with mummy. You become lazy. Hello? No, Dad, I'm gonna be late, sorry. Can you tell Mum, please? All right. John, you're not coming home? No, Ma, sorry. Ah, I made you chili con carne, your favorite! What should I do? Tell him to go fuck himself? If he tells me to stay late, I have to stay. Don't give me grief about it. What time are you coming home? I'll leave it on the counter. John. Where're you, are you still out? Yes, Ma. I'm on the way home. What, you're still at work? Yeah, what can I tell you? We took long. Madonna, do you know what time it is? You need to catch some sleep, ta. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be fine. I'll get some sleep. But this is not a decent hour to come home, you know how much I worry about you. I can't even sleep. Yeah. I'm sorry, Ma, all right? It's not like I asked you to stay up for me. Ah, mela. You have to think about us as well, we need to go to work too. Yeah, Ma, but... What do you expect me to do? We finished late. You don't have work in the morning at least, so you can catch some sleep? Yep. I work at eight. What? Work? Again? Didn't you tell me you don't have work, madonna? John, why can't you tell them to change the hours a bit? - Ma, man! - These stupid questions. Gonna go home, get some sleep for a few hours, then wake up and go to the internship. It'll be fine. Can we just talk in the morning, please? Yeah, with you everything I ask is a stupid question. - All right. You know best. -Okay, Ma, all right. -All right, bye. Ciao, ciao... - There's food in the fridge... I love you. Tin. Hmm? Hmm-mm. Hello? Hi, Sophie? Who is this? It's John's mum, sweetheart. Um, no... No, he was driving back home. Uh, yes. Yes, let me check. Half two. Yeah, maybe. I dunno, he's still making his way back from work. Don't worry. Don't worry, sweetheart. I'm sure he is. Go back to sleep. Okay, bye. John! John! - John? John? - John? John? Tin! John Caruana. John Caruana. Come on, ejja. I'll take you to your flat. It's fine, I'll catch a taxi. Catch a taxi? Come on, my car is right here. I'm offering you a lift, ejja. Can you even drive like this? Like this? This is Malta, darling, not... Denmark. All right? You don't trust me? It's okay, I'll catch a taxi. I'm a good driver, ta! You're drunk! Maybe we can get a taxi together. Don't waste my money. You're living in Sliema, no? That's five minutes from here. Come on. You don't trust me or what? Listen, it's, it's not that I don't trust you, it's... I can't. I can't. It's too much of a hassle for me. I need the car in the morning. I can't leave it here. You won't lose time. Just wake up an hour earlier. No way! Then traffic in the morning? I will lose time. I... I can't leave it here. It was a good night. We had a nice time. Don't ruin it. Just give me the keys and let's grab a taxi. Yeah? You had a nice time? You know, I did. If you listen to me now, I'll give you my number and we can meet again. Meet again? Yeah. Or maybe... If you listen to me, we can meet again. In my flat. Right now. I like that idea. Yeah? -Mmm. -Because I can meet again... and again. But you'll have to be quiet or you'll wake up my roommate. I have to be quiet? You have to be quiet. Yes, you're right. You can help me. I'm sure you are resourceful. Yeah, depends. Do I get to meet your flatmate too? Hmm, that could be fun. It's your call. As you said, we can be at my place in five minutes or we can even walk. All you have to do is give me your keys. Can't believe you prefer driving drunk, rather than having a potential threesome. What is wrong with you? As far as I'm aware, you didn't have to come with me, if you didn't want to. I'm not gonna let you drive drunk alone. Watch out! Hey, I'm a good driver! Okay? In fact... I'm one of those drivers who drives better drunk... ...and, and I'm not drunk. I'm just, you know, tipsy. You know, in fact, you know what they say? It's you shouldn't drive tired-drunk, It's you shouldn't drive tri-- tired. You sound like a fucking idiot. I hope it's the alcohol talking. You should've let me drive, I didn't drink. Okay, yeah. But you know, you forget something. It's my car. All right. What're you doing? Oh, come on, don't be mean. I gave you a choice. God, all these fucking rules. Your fault. My fault? You sound like my mother. I was gonna say I'll call you, but I'm changing my mind. Can I call you? Depends. Can I still call you a taxi? Oh, no, it's fine, honestly. I live, like, five minutes from here. Wait, wait, before you go. Don't let anything bad happen to you. I'd like to meet you again, idiot! Thank you. Hmm. Thank you. Hmm... Joe? Joe? Joey! Joey! Mar! B-E-L-200. B-E-L-200. B-E-L-200. B-E-L-200. B-E-L-200? B-E-L-200. B-E-L-200? John! John! John? John? John! John! What the fuck is wrong with you guys? I pulled over because I was tired. What's the big deal? I was tired, I fell asleep. What's the big deal? You're letting your mind get the better of you. What's the problem? I'm all right. I'm not an idiot. I was thinking of making some lasagne tonight, Ma. Wanna help me? Ma? Sure, yes, sweetheart. Listen, there're some grants I want you to have a look at. Okay? When you can. Thanks. Fuck it. Okay then, fuck it. It's a long story. Thanks, Ma.
