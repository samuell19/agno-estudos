[intense music playing] [man] Okay, Cherry, all cards are on the table. We got a serious problem here. Turning tricks is one thing, but robbery that's a felony. And robbery with a weapon, that's robbery first degree. You're looking at five years minimum. Come on, Captain. You detectives have been trying to pin that robbery shit on one of us girls for months. It's bullshit and you know it. Hands in the cage, animal. Fuck! You don't wanna fucking do this! [muttering indistinct] You're not gonna fucking get away with this. What the fuck did you just-- Shut the fuck up! Night-night, bitch. [indistinct] Snake... Wait for my signal, okay. Stay in the cell. - Wait till I get dressed. - Right. Okay. I know we got your DNA all over that room. I fucked that dude, I admit it. I fucked that dude hard. I'd be shocked if my DNA wasn't in the room. But DNA is not robbery, you stupid damn motherfucker! Asshole. Be ready. Come on, Cherry, help me out. You help me and I'll help you. No! You know what? I didn't rob anybody, and I'm tired of the goddamn scam. You're charging me with felony, I want a lawyer. You want a lawyer? I'll get you a lawyer. But in the meantime, you're gonna hang out with the boys down in holding. Fuck you. - Can I help you officer? - [gasps] - Whoa. - Surprise. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Surprise, surprise. - Don't fucking move. - All right, just-just relax. Now you in my jail now. Okay, just tell me what you need. Just settle down and relax. Tell me what you need. - Who the fuck are you? - Shut the fuck up, you're next. And you do exactly as I tell you. Okay, all right, just-just relax. Take the handcuffs out and cuff yourself. Okay. Okay. Take 'em out and put them on. All right, all right. - All right, all right. - From behind, asshole. Look, all right, all right, all right. I ain't playin' with you, man. Okay, all right, I'm cuffed. All right, I'm cuffed. - Nice try, motherfucker. - [cuffs tighten] Now get the fuck up. Okay, all right, all right, just-just settle down. - [Cherry gasps] - [mutters] Don't you fucking move. - Shut it. - All right. - Is it true? - No. - [gunshot] - Everybody down! Go, Raj, get 'em! Grab the weapons. [Raj] Sit down, come here. [Snake indistinct] Don't do something stupid, pops! [Snake] Your fucking move now. Don't look at me! Get 'em cuffed, get 'em cuffed. Let's go, let's go! We ain't got much time! - Hurry up. - No heroes today, pops. Handcuff that asshole. You guys like this, huh? You like seeing your captain like this? Move. Don't give me a fucking reason, sit down. Put a fucking cuff on. Put it on! [Snake laughing] [Raj] Do her, man. [soft chuckle] [indistinct police radio chatter] [Raj] Now what, man? Now... Now we wait. Shit... Shit... [mutters] Shit! Fuck. [screams] [suspenseful music playing] Patch me through. Right away. [phone ringing] - What? - This is FBI Special Agent Roger Kinkaid. Who am I speaking to? This is McMasters, and I have the captain and a few other pigs in here. Okay, Mr. McMasters. What do you want from us? I don't know. Let me get back to you about that. Shit. What do we do now? There's nothing we can do until he calls back. [sighs] [suspenseful music playing] [Kinkaid] Okay, what do we know about these three men? Okay, Frank Williamson a.k.a. Snake, he is a convicted rapist, gun and drug smuggler. He's been arrested multiple times and his attorney always finds a way to get him off. Rajesh Carnak, a.k.a. the Midnight Strangler, the famous serial killer. - He's the one responsible-- - Okay, okay. I'm very familiar with this case. Let's move on. Mike McMasters. Paranoid schizophrenic and the leader of this group. He was arrested for homicide and got off scot-free. Apparently there wasn't enough evidence to convict him. The three have a long history. They've known each other for years. They've been incarcerated together and wanted to form some sort of alliance to bring terror to small communities, eventually working their way up to larger cities. Thank God they didn't get to do that. Yes, but look what happened now. A rapist, a serial killer and a paranoid schizophrenic holding hostages. What a fucking mess. - [coughing] - Hey. Look what I found. Hey, can we keep her? - Better yet, can I have her? - [shudders] She's all yours. - You can't do that! - Shut the fuck up! - Sit your ass down. - Hey, I found her, she's mine. He said I could have her, dammit, not you. Fuck, chicken head. I fucking found her. - I'm taking her. - That's enough! [whimpering] Officer, it's scary. He looks so evil. I know one minute you're mean, the next minute you're a good, good cop. I'm in good hands, right? You won't hurt me. Will you take her over there? We'll figure out what we're gonna do with her later on. - Get over there. - Don't hurt me. [grunts] I know what I'm gonna do with her later on. - You ain't doing shit. - [laughing] Thank God she's mine, man. Are you okay? - [breathes heavily] - He's not a cop. [McMasters] Knock off the chit chat. Thanks. [suspenseful music playing] McMasters, right? Look, uh, you can still get out of this. All you gotta do is let us all go. I mean, I'll put in a good word for you and the others. Look, I'll tell the FBI you didn't hurt me or any of my guys. - They'll just think-- - [Cherry yells] Hey! [groans] [man] Oh, no, no. Don't worry, sweetheart. He's only sleeping. - He needs a doctor. - Get her ass down. You bastard! - What do we do now? - We got in this together, we'll get out of it. We got this. Maybe we could use these pigs as bargaining chips, huh? What do you think they're worth? - A million dollars? - A million dollars each? They ain't worth a hundred grand. Get the fuck out of my face. [Snake] Look, man, it's a million dollars. That's what they're worth, that's what we're gonna get. - We gotta lock this place down. - Go get it done, it's your job. I got it. What are we gonna do with that bitch? Officer... I'm sure you make a lot of money. I have a daughter, she needs me. I'm not that bright so I'm useless here, can I go? We're gonna have a lot of fun with her. Later. Much later. No, I'm useless. You listen and sit your fucking ass down. Now! I'm sorry. [sobbing] I'm sorry. [dramatic music playing] I'm gonna call. [phone ringing] Yes? McMasters, it's Roger Kinkaid. Ready to talk now? Sure. But first, is there anybody hurt in there? Anybody need medical attention? Everybody's fine. - For now. - Okay. So what exactly do you want from us? Well, for starters I want four million apiece. A million for each pig here. And for the captain, I want a chopper, a pilot and a full tank of gas. And the bitch, you can have her for free. Got this? Consider it a gift from me to you since I'm so polite. What girl? Well, well, well. For someone who works in the intelligence field, you sure don't have much, do you? [laughing] She's nothing, she's a whore. We found her. That's why you get it for free. McMasters, you gotta realize that we can't get $4 million that quickly. Listen to me, you fuck! I'm the one in charge here! Do you get this? And if I don't have these demands, I will start killing these people one by one every hour. You got that, amigo? And as for the bitch, we will fuck her, we will gut her, and we will kill her, and fuck her again! Not in that particular order. I think you get the point. You have one hour. Fuck. Fuck! [groaning] [breathing deeply] Where did this girl come from? I don't know. The problem with a paranoid schizophrenic is we never know who we're actually talking to. What are you doing here, Rodriguez? - Move. - By whose authority? I'm in charge now. [phone ringing] McMasters, this is Rodriguez. Who's this? Put Kinkaid on the line. McMasters, this is Rodriguez and I'm in charge now. Listen, I'm in charge! Listen, McMasters, I'm not here to play your games. Put Captain Davis on the phone now. Oh-- Oh, yeah? - [gunshot] - [screaming] [officer] Fuck! You-- fuck you! Calm your ass! Calm the fuck down! What have you done? Did you see what you made me do? That one's on you. Put Kinkaid on the line now. I'm here. Kinkaid, I want my money. You got an hour. You SWAT guys, you're a hammer, but not every problem is a nail. You did this. Oh, my God. [McMasters] Get her out of here. [sobbing] You bastard asshole! [whimpering] No! You bastard! [sobbing] We know all about Captain Davis, but what do we know about the hooker? We don't know anything about the hooker. Honestly, McMasters is our problem. Look, it may not be in his file, but he claimed during his last trial that he blacks out before he kills. He killed six members of the Stephenson family, and then he said he didn't remember any of it. He's a killer. They all have their story. Cindy Stephenson, the only survivor, watched him kill her entire family and he was armed only with his fist while reciting Psalms Ten. Psalms 10? What the hell does that have to do with it? It's some Psalm revolving around evil against God and such. Some weird shit. She also said that he appeared to be dreaming in some sort of trance, so much that he couldn't even see her. Kinkaid... trust me... McMasters is our problem. - Chow time, huh? - Hell yeah. - You guys feel like pizza? - Yeah, that sounds good to me. Yeah, me too. You know, I was thinking... wasn't this your girlfriend's? [chuckles] [phone ringing] Kinkaid. We're ready for lunch now. McMasters... Uh, we have sandwiches. We'll send in some sandwiches, how's that? No, we'll take pizza, pepperoni. No, you can't just call us and order pizza like that. Listen, I'm in charge here, okay? And we'll take pizza. No, no, I'm not doing this. We'll send you in the same sandwiches that we have. That's it. Guys... [screaming] Tell 'em. Tell, 'em, tell 'em! You tell 'em and they'll feed us. Yeah. Yeah. - [screaming] - [Kinkaid] Okay. What? I can't hear you. - Okay, okay, stop. - We're getting our pizza? We'll get you your damn pizza. Get this bitch out of my face! Take her out of here! Kinkaid, you need to start listening to what I say! Do everything I say, whatever I want, you give it to me, motherfucker! You hear me?! Or I'll fucking kill everybody! We will all die! - Fuck you! - [phone slams] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck you! John, yeah, Kinkaid. Yeah, right. Listen, I need a favor. You gotta get us some pizzas. No, no, no, no. Just the-the real delivery boy. No, we'll take responsibility for him. Pizzas and the delivery boy, understand? No-- no, wire, no camera, nothing. Right. All right. We're waiting. So where do you guys wanna start from now? I've been reading up on McMasters' file, and he fancies himself a lady's man. So I'm gonna give him a chance to be one. So what are you gonna do, flirt with him? Oh, this will be the first flirtatious negotiation I've had the pleasure of ever experiencing. No, I'm gonna play to his ego and find out what started this shit. [chuckles] Well, let me ask you this. Do you need a moment to put on your make up? What is that supposed to mean? [Kinkaid] Whoa, hang on. We got a real problem here. We gotta act quickly. Did you know that McMasters is a paranoid schizophrenic and is normally under heavy medication? I read something about that in his file. And claustrophobia is part of his pathology. No. No, I didn't know that. What's your point? His murder revolves around his schizophrenia and it's triggered by enclosed spaces. Okay, the bullpen is larger than his cell. My point is that when he's in his cell, he's getting daily medication. Son of a bitch. We are well past that now. He could explode at any moment. Look what I found. [McMasters] Fucking food, finally. Put that pizza there right there. Check his ass for wires. Put your hands up. Turn around. Okay, he's clean. You're kind of cute, huh? Think I might wanna keep you to play with you for a while. Hey, Raj, check him out. Yeah, nothing to check out. Not my style. - [chuckles] - Hey, you got me. - Leave him alone. - Shut the fuck up and sit down. Knock it off. Pizza boy... I got a message for you. It's for Roger Kinkaid, the FBI agent in charge out there. You tell him Mike McMasters says hello. And that I'm right here whenever he wants to see me. And you let him know that his captain and all his fellow officers are okay. Everyone's fine. And remind him about the money he owes me. Can you do that for me? Don't fuck up. Now if I were you, I'd pick that up. Get the fuck out of here. [shirt rips] [groans] It's a shame your lady isn't gonna get down on this pizza. You hungry? You okay? - Hey, you okay? - [groans] [coughs] You, my friend... [mutters indistinct] Where's Falcon? Where's Falcon?! They-they killed her, Captain. - What? - They fucking killed her! [groans] Fuck you! Go and shoot me! Fucking shoot me! No, you-you bastards. You fucking bastards! You fucking mother son of a bitch, McMasters, you're gonna fry! You are so gonna fucking fry, and I'm gonna put the needle in your arm my fucking self! Or I'll fucking kill you myself right fucking now, you fucking asshole! - Shut the fuck up! - Fuck you! Fuck-- - Fuck you! - [Cherry groans] Shut the fuck up! I will fucking kill you! If I just wanna kill anybody, I'm gonna kill you! You got that? You fucking piece of shit! - Fuck you! - No, please, no! Sit down. - No. - What's your problem? You think... You think I'm afraid of you? No. You're a bastard, but I lived with one. Yeah? What was he like? My daughter's father. [soft chuckle] I thought I married a good man and we were gonna live happily after. But, you know, he's like you, lunatic motherfucker serial killer. - Yeah. - You know, he turned on me. - Good. - Just when my daughter turned one year old. That night he-- I never seen that face. One hand had gun, the other hand he had a scissor. And he pointed at me, asked me to choose. You know, you kill me or kill my daughter. What'd you choose? Come on, what you choose? I couldn't, I wouldn't. He's a bastard. I got lucky but it was a nightmare. You know why I like him? He's passionate. Turns me on just like you. Just like me, huh? You're just a fucking whore. Only a whore. You know what happened to him? What? What happened? He got crushed by a car, terrible accident. You know, life's a bitch, right? [chuckles] Huh? - Yeah, it is. - Hey. - Hey. - What, what? If I fuck you, you're not gonna hurt me, right? If I fuck you, no? - No. - No. - No, great. - I won't hurt you. I'll fuck you. If I fuck you... I will have no choice but to hurt you. Do you understand? - I'll fuck you good. - Yes. - Yes. - Yeah. We're good, right? Yeah. Yeah, you can have some pizza. Kinkaid, your time's running out. You have my demands? [Kinkaid over phone] We have the money, but you're gonna have to wait five minutes. I want everything, and if I don't get it in five minutes, another one of your people's gonna die. [exhales] [Cortez] Hey. Hey. Why don't you let us go? Please, please. I've tortured and killed a lot of people in my life, especially liked killing those young sorority girls. And I've always wanted to kill a cop. Not a fast death, you understand? A slow, agonizing death. One to remember, huh? I wanna feel your pain for the rest of my life. [chuckles] Maybe if you entertain me, I'll just permanently disable you, huh? That's it, decided. You two will be my first cops. It's gonna be a fuckin' miracle. It's gonna be great! I can't wait. Hey, hey, come on, man. Quit fucking around. Even you don't wanna kill two cops. That's insane. - Come on, stop. - Cortez, stop. - He ain't screwing around. - Of course he is, - he's just trying-- - Listen to your friend, bitch! This ain't no goddamn game... we're playing. What the hell just happened? - God. Shut the fuck up. - No. He's gonna come back here, he's gonna torture us and then he's gonna kill us. - Do you get the picture? - No, no. He's not-- He's not-- He doesn't wanna-- - [guys muttering indistinct] - Get this whiney bitch out of here now. [stammers] No, no, Osborn, Osborn! Stop, please! - [kicks drawer] - McMasters... If you kill-- If you kill another cop... they're not gonna give you anything. Nothing. Davis! Whitney! They're gonna fuck you up! [yells] Fucking psycho! Yeah? But you know what they're gonna give you? [groans] You're a fucking psycho! [groaning] Captain John Davis, we award you with the badge of disgrace 'cause you couldn't keep your family alive when they needed you most! [Cherry] Shut the fuck up! You're a stupid motherfucker lunatic psychopath racist white trash asshole! That's you. Shut the fuck up, before I fuck you and kill you. No, you will not because I fuck good. You will not kill me, I fuck good. You will not kill me, you know that? Ehh. Fuck you. - [moaning] - Fucking asshole. Come fuck me. Come fuck me, you motherfucking. - Fuck you, asshole. - Fuck you, bitch. Fuck me, come. Come here. Fucking asshole. Come, come, come, come. [Cortez groans] [dramatic music playing] You two stay here. I got some business to take care of with this bitch. Not you, bitch. You. [suspenseful music playing] - Hey, promise me one thing. - Whatever you want. I'll only fuck you, not the other guys, okay? Whatever you say. Pick me up. McMasters... [muttering indistinct] Slow, slow, slow. Slow down. I'm yours. You're in charge. I'm only yours. Shh. I fuck good. Fuck me. - [McMasters and Cherry moaning] - [chair creaking] Yes, sir. Man, I'm getting a piece of that ass if it kills me. He might kill you, too. You think that damn freak McMasters is gonna share his piece of ass with you? Who's fucking you? I fuck good, I'm your fucking bitch! - [grunts] - [screams] Fuck! You asshole! [screams] You dumbasses. McMasters doesn't give a shit about you. He's like my brother. I know he's gonna share with me. Not a chance, dude. No man shares his spoils. No man. That damn whore is playin' hard, he's hers. Listen to that shit. Slow down, slick. Take your time, McMasters. You can fuck me as long as you want any time you want. But promise, promise I only fuck you. - Not the other guys, promise. - Fuck me. - Promise you, asshole, promise. - I promise! [both grunting] You ain't heard nothing yet. Wait till I'm up in there. [chuckles] Yeah, right. - [screams] - [grunting] Fuck you, motherfucker. [whispers] Oh, yeah. - Fuck. - You're my bitch. I'm your fucking bitch. [sobbing] But not others, okay? No... [indistinct] I wanna please only you. Yeah... come on. I fuck good, right? You fuck good. What? [Snake] Nothing. You have something to do, right? Yeah, man. Do it. Got lip-- My lipstick's all over you. [chuckles] Why don't you go ahead and have a seat? Who are you pointing that gun at? [suspenseful music playing] McMasters. McMasters, get up! Hey. Where is our money? You-- What'd you just say to me, man? Take it easy, man. [Raj] Calm down. Take it easy. Easy, man. No reason to worry. What happened? It's okay, man, don't worry. Just calm down. No reason to worry. Huh? [shuddering breathing] [phone ringing] Kinkaid here. McMasters. You got the demands? They're on their way. I'm gonna need my medication. I know, your meds are on the way. I need it now... or everybody is gonna die. Medication. My medication. Now. [grunting] Maybe we'll get lucky and he'll whack himself. Sounds like he's losing it. Goddammit, fuck! Shit, fuck! [grunting] We're gonna get them all killed. Don't talk like that. [whispers] Come on. Come on. What exactly is your fucking problem? We gotta move faster. Snake, I need you to do negotiations, please. Yeah. I'll get us out of here. - You just-- - No, no, no, no, no. You don't understand, man. I gotta get out of here, now. If I move too fast, we're gonna end up right back in this fuckin' place. Just calm down. I can't stay calm. [sniffles] I need my medication. I need to get out of here if I don't have my medication. I gotta go, now. You're gonna have to get your shit under control, man. I'll get us out of here. Don't touch me. I'll get your meds, you got that? Now come on. No. I'm gonna stay here. There's too many people out there. McMasters. Dammit. Fuck. Hey, Raj, leave the bitch alone. McMasters is sick, I'm in charge. - Who said? - I did. So you're the one who's gonna get me my money now? I'm gonna get the money for us, not for you, for us. Get on with it, shit's taken long enough already. [phone rings] - Who's this? - This is Kinkaid. Can we talk about how this all got started? I mean, whose idea was it to rush the bullpen, take hostages? McMasters? Kinkaid, this is Snake. McMasters is sick, he needs his meds. He's strugglin'. I, uh-- I was just-- I saw that in his file. But even if he took them right now it would take a while for them to build up in his system. - You understand? - I want it now. How about... How about if we transferred you to a minimum security prison, would that help things along? Transfer? He'd never go for transfer. We want money and safe passage in Mexico. $4 million, a helicopter, Mexico. I could promise you that I would do my best. But you know that's not gonna happen, right? Man, you don't got much time. I'm not asking you to sell out your friends. I know you're not that kind of guy. But Raj and McMasters, they're a whole another story. Before you say anything, I'd like to tell you something man to man. I'm so glad that you've taken over the situation. I mean, you're the only rational mind in the room, you know what I mean? And I'll make you this promise. I will get you those meds as soon as possible. Okay? Hurry up, please. That's a win. Huge win. Raj, go check on that son of a bitch. - He's flipping out in there. - Why don't you do it? 'Cause I said for you to. Do you understand me? [Raj] Damn bullshit. It's just starting right now. McMasters. - McMasters. - [gasps] - You okay? - Who are you? Raj. - Who? - Raj, man. - You all right? - You got my meds? We're working on it, just give it a beat. - We're working on it. - Give me my meds, man. Put the gun down, man. Chill out, dude. - Give me my fucking meds. - We're working on the meds. Put the fucking gun down, man. Who gave you the authority to promise him meds? What the hell do you think you're doing, Kinkaid? I'm trying to stop a bloodbath. Kinkaid's taking over the negotiations. Let's just get these meds ready for delivery. No. There will be no meds delivered. Do you understand the extent of the situation over there? Nothing will be given to that group without concessions on their part. If McMasters goes psychotic, there'll be no negotiations just an aftermath. My position is not up for debate. From here on out, this situation will be handled by the book. No concessions. [Raj] Snake. Look, I know you and McMasters go back a long ways. That dude's lost it and that's a big problem. But Kinkaid said he's gonna get the meds. I know he's gonna come through. Yeah, well he better and quickly. Otherwise we're gonna have to take out that damn freak ourselves. You saw how he pulled his guns on us. What the fuck are you afraid of? You've got a gun, too. Get in there and watch him. Just don't fucking kill him. [scoffs] You wanna take all the fun out of this for me, huh? Look, I don't give a shit. I'm not sure which one of you assholes scares me more. [scoffs] Just hang in there, Cherry. They're gonna get us out of here, I promise. [sniffles] I'll be dead by then. No, you won't. Just hang in there, just a little longer. It'll be over soon. Think about your daughter. I am, but I'm not sure I can get out of this. Please, and I'll be any good for anyone. Just a little longer. It'll be over soon. Davis, can you see it? They're screwing this whole thing up. They're gonna get us killed. [suspenseful music playing] What you're proposing is gonna get people killed. It's gonna get cops killed. And I don't think it's legal to withhold meds from this man. Is that how you feel also? Rodriguez, mistakes were made. It happens in a negotiation. It's the nature of the game, come on. Nothing will be sent to that bullpen. No more food, no water. Nothing. And there will be no more communication with that bullpen until they call us. Your hard line approach is gonna blow up in our faces. [laughing] [Raj] What's so damn funny? What's funny? Your so called leader is back there losing it. He's gonna get you both killed or kill you both himself. Shut up! [grunting] [winces] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, man. I need to get control. I have to take control of the situation. [suspenseful music playing] Fuck. Fuck. Snake, may I talk to you? What do you want? It's about Davis. He's in a very bad shape. He's unconscious. - Are you fucking with me? - No, no, I swear. I have a very bad feeling about this. - Please help. - I'll take care of this. Thank you. [phone ringing] Snake, this is Rodriguez. [Snake] Who is this? Every time I call it's a new bullshitter. What can I do for you, Snake? I asked for some meds. And I gotta tell you one of your hostages is in bad shape. So are you offering me Captain Davis for the meds? No, I'm just giving you information. Well, if you want the meds, you're gonna have to give us the captain. I don't give a damn about the meds. The captain on the other hand, you want him, make an offer. I don't give a fuck if he dies or not. Well, Snake, you do know that it's murder? Look, dumbass, who do you think you're dealing with? We're facing life no matter what happens if we ever get out of here. Let me call you back, Snake. Suit yourself. What are you gonna offer him now? The meds for the captain. You know the difference between you and Kinkaid? [Rodriguez] Hm? Kinkaid recognized that he underestimated that asshole. He actually gave a damn. You're too arrogant to recognize or care about anything. - I can have you removed. - [scoffs] You have no authority over me. You have no authority over me! I'm losing, I'm losing. If there is a God I will believe in you. Please send me magic and power. Get me out of here. Please. Please. [sobs] Snake, may I go to the bathroom? [Snake] Yeah. - Come with me. - Okay. Please-- Please, don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. [whimpers] Save that bullshit for McMasters. I don't wanna hurt you. I don't wanna fuck you. Torture, pain. That's what I want. That's what I need. Relax, I'm not going anywhere. I'm not. You know what your problem is? You try so hard to be in control but you're not in control. Let me tell you this. I'm a fucking whore. If I fuck one more man, doesn't make any difference. But it will make difference for you, remember that. If you fuck me right now, you lose control over me and get fucking punished. [screaming] [sobbing] I'm done with you. [whimpering] What are you doing? Get out there, now! [suspenseful music playing] [line ringing] Who's this? This is Rodriguez. I'm calling to make an offer. Look, I wanna talk to Kinkaid. Kinkaid here. I've got somebody here who wants to talk to you. Hold on. [Cherry] Is this FBI Agent Kinkaid? Yes, this is Kinkaid. Who is this? Nice to hear your voice. It's Cherry. I wanna talk to you about Davis, the captain. I'm listening. I think he'll die if he doesn't go to see a doctor. And he's breathing very poor and right now he's suddenly unconscious. Cherry, how are you? Have they hurt you? I'm... I'm, uh... I'm fine, I'll be fine. So what's your offer? So, Snake, the offer is meds for the captain. Look, this is how it is. In an hour I give Davis to Raj to use as a toy. Then I give Cherry to McMasters. Now I want those meds and food, then we'll talk. I had a rapport with Snake. Good job. [suspenseful music playing] It's been a few minutes since the food was delivered. You wanna check in now? Uh... Yeah. - Who is it this time? - Snake, it's Kinkaid. The food okay? Yeah, man, it's good. Now, I-I sent you, uh, a gesture of good faith. Yeah, what is it? Meds for McMasters. It's in one of the food containers. Hey, Kinkaid, I appreciate it. Thanks, man. All right, now listen, uh, you give me a call when you're ready to talk. Yeah, I'll do that. Chris, could we put together a list of potential prisons that we could transfer these guys to? Sure, I can do that. McMasters is gonna be especially difficult though. You know, I must admit, Snakes' demeanor changed. But those meds were our biggest bargaining chip. And now they're gone. I think the bigger question is did we get it to him in time? Yeah. Kinkaid said they put a tranquilizer in a food container. Did we throw that shit away? Yeah. Ah, shit. Man, there's only one in here. I hope this shit works. Damn straight. Look, I ain't scared of much, but that son of a bitch scares the shit out of me. When are we gettin' to Mexico? Soon. Very soon. [Kinkaid on phone] You got Kinkaid. Hey, Kinkaid, listen, uh, I need to get Davis out of here to a doctor. Man, I got two problems though. What are the problems? Look, these two think we're headed to Mexico. And if I give up Davis, they're gonna want answers. - Are they armed? - Yes. Snake, this is the deal: I can get you into a minimum security prison. Will Raj go for the same deal? Man, if he doesn't I'm gonna have to kill him. I have no idea what I'm gonna be dealing with once McMasters wakes up. There's nothing I can do with McMasters. No one will take him. Now, you give me, Davis, and I'll get you and Raj into minimum security prisons. That's the deal. But you've got to convince Raj, okay? Yeah, that sounds good. I'm worried about Snake. He's the most rational of the three, but... he sounded scared of Raj. I just wonder how persuasive Snake can be. You said we'd be out of this shit hole and in Mexico by now. That was the motherfucking deal, period. Between him and the two cops we killed, this deal went south. So the plan's changed now, huh? It's because of you and McMasters that this deal's dead. You know what, fuck the cops, fuck McMasters. Why did the plan change, huh? Was it because of that whore? Mesmerized her with your voodoo like she did him? Let me tell you something. If I go to prison, that bitch dies. Raj, minimum security prison. It's a fucking country club, that's what our offer is. [Raj] It's life, Snake. We'll still be in prison for life. You guys have life, I had short time. - You guys had life. - Yeah, I had life. That's why I listened to you and McMasters. We're supposed to be in Mexico. You know what, I think I can make it still, too. No, we can't make it. It's over. Yeah, we can't, Snake. I-- I'm gonna make it. And the princess is going with me. Look, man, we're lucky Davis is still alive. Without that bitch, I got no power left. Well, I guess you're fucked then, ain't you? You know what, I'm in charge. You and McMasters can leave whenever you want. Bitch is mine. [suspenseful music playing] [phone ringing] Snake, did you work things out with Raj? Yeah, we talked. And the answer's go fuck yourself. Snake and McMasters can leave whenever they want. The bitch and I want a helicopter on out of here. Raj, I can't get you a helicopter. Only the governor can approve that. All right, have it your way. You know, I've been wanting to die. Maybe tonight's the night. But the bitch goes with me and that's on your ass. Oh, God. So what exactly did he say? He said he can't authorize a chopper. So you say you're gonna kill yourself and the bitch. [chuckles] Yeah, and I mean to do it. So I'm fucked? I need the bitch for my transfer. Well, that's not my fucking problem now, is it? Why do you wanna kill me? I didn't do anything wrong. I have a daughter. She needs me. Do you have a fucking heart? I don't want to die. If I have to pay, they have to pay. And you have to pay. That's just how it works. Okay, then. Then may I talk to my daughter for the one last time? Snake, can I speak to my daughter one last time? - I don't see why not. - Thank you. You can play up those tears all you want, but I know the truth. What truth? The truth about you and Snake. What about us? You're crazy, there's nothing-- fucking truth. There's no fucking truth between us. I'm just trying to stay alive. I'll do anything to achieve that. Do you understand, motherfucker? - Shut up! - Okay. Another truth, Raj. The truth about your sorry ass. You want to talk about that? You want to talk about that? Shut up, bitch, or I'll kill you right now. Go ahead, kill me, I'm already dead. But before that, let's discuss the truth about you, how you murdered a woman because you can't get up for one. A prison turned her into a fucking asshole for old real men. You lying whore. You're never gonna see your daughter again. - We'll see about that. - Shut up. I need to call Kinkaid and make a deal for myself. You're on your own and stay the fuck away from me. [phone ringing] Hello, Snake? [Snake] I wanna talk to Kinkaid. Kinkaid's not here. He's trying to find a way to help out your friend. Fuck him. He's not my friend, I just want my fucking deal. Okay, I promise. I'll tell them. It may take a bit because he's talking to the powers that be, okay? Look, if we leave now is my deal still intact? [Kinkaid] Snake, it's Kinkaid. Snake, your deal is in place but I need your help. You can't let Cherry go with Raj. You got my word. Okay, and you've got mine. So that's your plan? Trusting a guy named Snake? [suspenseful music playing] The fuck you looking at? What did you say? I said you're a bitch. [grunts] Oh, that hurt. - Say something else. - That's all you got? [grunting] The girl was right, you're dickless. [taser buzzes] [screams] - [taser buzzes] - [grunts] Shit. See you in hell. Get on this desk. Listen to me, listen to me. What do you want? What do you want? I'm not gonna hurt you. Relax. [groans] Okay. What's wrong? You fucked me good. I need you to fuck me one more time and then kill me, okay? You kill me. Don't do that, don't do that, don't do that. [yelps] Stop, stop. Stop. You said I fuck good, but I'm gonna show you I fuck even better with a gun. [both grunting] Snake! The hell's going on here, man? [gunshot] I think he just killed the bitch. Get down on your knees. I said get down on your knees! [suspenseful music playing] Worthless piece of shit! Think you're in control? This is for my daughter. [laughing] So you're gonna kill me too, bitch? Now it is my turn, fucking asshole. [gun clicks] Well, my, my, my. [suspenseful music playing] [gunshot] Who are you? Cherry. It's Kinkaid, FBI. We spoke, remember? Yes. Yes. Clear. What a mess. Here we go, here we go. Here we go. You're okay now. You're safe.
