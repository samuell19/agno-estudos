Inspired on true events. The day was as dark as a wolf's mouth. The mora ran to the Teixadal forest to fetch water from the three fountains It was raining, so she took shelter under a five-hundred-year-old yew tree She curled among the tree roots and fell asleep. Then she heard a voice coming from the wolves' den. Do you want to know what the voice said to her? DIRTY WOLVES 'For us, wolfram (tugsten) is like blood to man' German ambassador to Spain. You, what the hell are you looking at? Beware, she might cast us the evil eye. Leave the widow alone, she has enough problems of her own. Yeah, a bastard girl... who's got the course Okay, go on. You, get over here! Your shoes. Move along. Move along! We don't want thieves here! Careful, careful. Let's see what we got here. Welcome to the end of the world. We are on the highest mountains of Galicia. You may have noticed the only road there is ends right here. You are here because your sentences were commuted to labor. This is your only chance to get probation... so don't screw it. The building behind you are your barracks. The free miners live to the south of here. It is forbidden to exit the precinct... to mingle with the free workers... or fuck around with me. This is all you've got? There's more than 15 kilos. It's good stuff, sir Bryan. All I can give you is 1,000 pesetas... You don't pay much compared to what we go through to get it. So its true, what they say. That you dump it in the Vigo sea. That's none of your business. And if I went to the sea to fetch what you threw away, would you buy it again? The important thing is to prevent the Germans from getting hold of it. Because they use this and what your sister and all of them dig up... to build tanks and bombs. They are the enemy. Oh, and you English are the good guys? And what are we Spaniards? One thousand. And five hundred more. For you, this wolfram thing is just business... but it can decide who wins the war... it's a matter of life and death. You sneak around... like wolves in the night. I don't want you to go back to the woods. Do you hear me? With the 8 pesetas you earn we don't have enough. We need to buy medicine for Alba. Your sister is right. And the other day Miguel Anxo, the apothecary's son, They say he was found torn into seven pieces. It was the wolves. No wolves. The Guardia Civil. Or thieves. You could ask for a job at the mine. I'm not going to dig for wolfram at the mine when they pay ten times more in the black market. Why don't you go scratch your balls? Hey, 'Musician'. Does it bother you? You are Miguel Pefia 'the Musician', aren't you? I thought they'd shot you after what happened in Anújar. They gave you thirty years. Don't worry... Franco won't last that long, you'll see. Musician, Musician, take it easy. If you can't sleep, do as I do. Count everything. Count everything. The tons of wolfram... The women in your life... The prisoners... Count it all. And one day you might even sing for me. Good night. And welcome, Musician, welcome. Hey, look who's here! It's good to see you again, my friend. - How are you? -l'm well, how about you? Come on, I'll show you around. Let's have a drink. - With pleasure. - You must be thirsty, right? These are the plans that my mother kept. Is it true that the Germans stole the mine from you? And now I'm going to take it back. We have to connect the warehouse to the outside. Those inside must find a way through the abandoned galleries, here. We need to contact with Miguel Pefia. He can recruit a few trustworthy men. Right, we need a contact inside the mine. Come on, come on. Now, now. Aren't you naughty! Who's there? Do you want me to kill you, bastard? Candela! Put that down. We need to talk to you and your sister. This is what is happening, not far from here. Hundreds, thousands killed because of the Nazis. And they aren't soldiers they are women, children... Innocent people. It's none of our business With the wolfram they take from Galicia they'll be much more powerful, short of invincible. It is also your businnes. We need you. To us? Yes. We know they're about to ship a large quantity to the factory in Nordhausen. If this wolfram makes it to Mittelwerk... we could lose the war. With the help of the guerrilla, we want to steal all the wolfram. We need help from the prisoners at the mine. You could contact them... I'm not interested in any of this. Don't you care about what the stuff you dig at the mine is used for? No. They make bombs... and tanks. He said so. Our war is already over. That mine is the best thing that ever happened to this village. The mine feeds me and my daughter. And many other people who were on the verge of starvation two years ago. What are you giving your daughter? Yew berries. Yew... It's poisonous. How do you know? Edgar is a doctor. I don't know how you've managed to keep her alive... but without penicillin your child won't make it. I dont know what that is. It's a new medicine. In Spain it's very hard to find but if you help us... I'll get you some injections. All you have to do is hand this to a prisoner. I don't think it's too much to ask in exchange for curing your daughter. And who's this prisoner? Miguel Pefia. We met in Jaén. We can trust him. Do you want to save your daughter or not? EXCUSE me, EXCUSE me. Do you know where Miguel Pefia is? Yes. Second barrack, over there. Are you Miguel Pefia? There are a couple of foreigners at the village... They are involved with the guerrilla. They want you to help them. They want to steal the wolfram so it doesn't get to Germany. Here. Here. You must take this. There are lives at stake. They told me you were brave. This is good stuff! Tomorrow I'll go lo the mill and order two bags of flour. We'll have bread this whole month. We can't carry it all. We'll make two trips. I'm not tired. Hey you! What are you doing? Thieves! Get away from there! She's a wild one. What are you doing here? We were here before. This lode is ours. Where does it say that? This little friend does. I know you. And you'll know me better if you don't get out of here. Esteban, let it be. Nobody move! Drop what you've stolen. Run! run! Uxia! Uxia! You'll feel better tomorrow, okay? I gave her water from the three springs. This child came into the world badly, and she is going to leave it badly. And there's no water or spring to fix it. Manuela! Manuela! Manuela! Mother! Bring some cloth and the disinfectant! What happened? Hurry up! You go to the baby! Easy, easy. Plug the wound. Don't be afraid. Shall I bring more cloth? Come on! What are you looking at? You're here to work. Keep it down! Fuckers... When their shift is done, they're off to the Dollar to find women. And what about us, eh? What are you waiting for? Spring to come? Come on, dammit! Come on! Take it, Musician. Look, look at me. Come on, hurry up. We are coming! Get out! They're going to die! Stop her. Ey, stop! Get out! Stop! Are you okay? I don't know... Some of them are dead. The boss wants to talk to you. Now. Come on! What are you looking at? How did you know about the cave-in before it happened? I've heard about you. Your name is Manuela, right? Please, sit down. Don't be afraid. Take it. For most people this stone is just matter, without life or will. They cannot see the immense power it holds, nor understand... how it was formed, separating itself from quartz. Some would say it is magic or occult powers... or even witchcraft. But they're just ignorant. Incapable of understanding that all matter has its own soul. Do you recognize this picture? It resembles the yew grove. Many people dare not enter that forest. They're afraid of the wolves. But you aren't afraid of them, are you, Manuela? I've seen many wolves killed by men but I've never seen a wolf attack a man. Yews are ancient, lonely trees. There are no yew forests. But here... in this remote land, where Europe ends, they grow in groves... Why? Hey! Hey! Get away from here! Go away! Wait... You're not from around here. Pereira. The taxi driver? Pereira. He died months ago. Pereira is dead. Dead. Not here. Portugal... America. America. What do you want Candela? I told you to use the back door. I'm not bringing you any wolfram. I need the car. His name's Isaac. He must get to Portugal. You must be out of your mind, Candela. How can you walk around with an escaped Jew in broad daylight? A Jew? Do you see? Runaway. He is fleeing from the Germans. Why? What did he do'? Nothing. He did nothing. Don't you know the Germans hate the Jews? All I know about the Jews is that they killed Jesus Christ. That's what the priest says. I don't know what you're smiling at, you wise guy. I just wanted to drive him to the border. I don't care what he's done or what the Germans say. Our duty is to help him. No. We cannot draw attention and jeopardize what we're doing. So what do you suggest? To throw him out like a dog? Aren't you fighting the Germans? Aren't you supposed to care about people's lives? Lend me the car. You don't have to do anything. Can you drive? I know how to drive a mule cart... which is far more difficult. All right. But we'll wait until dark. You. Are you mad? Tell them I'll do it. Whenever you need to contact me, wear some colour... and we'll meet at lunchtime by the entrance to the mine that's closed, behind the latrines. - The Lola entrance. - Yes. Are you sure? Never doubt my word. You haven't told me your name. Manuela. Something big is cooking with the guerrilla and a couple of foreigners. I need men I can trust. I'm not good enough for you? I wanna fuck those bastards. I was already counting on you. The job requires a couple more men. Is that why the widow was looking for you the other day? And I always thought she went whichever way the wind blows We're reaching the bridge. The Civil Guard! Keep quiet. Good evening. Good evening. Going fishing? Yes. Get out the car. A bit late, uh? The fish must be asleep by now... And you too ought to be sleeping. Each in his bed. I don't think you'll catch a lot of fish with these rods. Where are you from? Are you French? Oui. And what does a young foreigner like you do around here? We've been through quite a mess in this country. You're not looking for trouble, are you? No, just sightseeing... in a neutral, peaceful country, no? I was invited by the ambassador. He is a friend of my father. He does'nt like trouble either. Get back in the car. And I better not see you here again. We must find another way. Thank you Good luck. Thank you Many thanks How come you speak Spanish? I was born here. Yes, sure. You're obviously Galician. No, my family used to own the mines. You're one of the D'Hoores? D'hoore They say... What? That your father hanged himself. Sorry. They're just stories... My father was murdered by the German Secret Service. So they could take possession of the mines. They made believe it was suicide. And whoever says otherwise is lying. Is that clear? I hope we come across the Civil Guard again... If you kiss me again, I'll cut your balls off. Let's go. Come on... Mother! Leave me alone. Don't make me angry. Come on. What time do you think it is? Help me. I brought some papers... Not now! Help me. What? Mother, enough! Come on. There. This is for Miguel. Is it raining? No... The bottom of your skirt is wet. Didn't Edgar say anything about the medicines? Last night she hardly slept a full hour at a time. And she's feverish again... He'll bring them for her. I don't trust these foreigners. Well, it's time to trust someone. Say something. You're making me nervous. We'll start at nightfall. We'll dig a short tunnel here in the forest... that will take us to the abandoned gallery. Navas, you and your men will take charge of the tunnel. Miguel and his men will reach the gallery through the abandoned entrance... and dig a hole through the back wall of the warehouse where the wolfram is kept. When the two tunnels are finished... we'll have direct access from outside to the wolfram sacks... We'll take it all... ...so that when the Nazis come to load their trucks they'll have the surprise of their lives. Two more prisoners died this morning. Coughing up black stuff'? Yes, Mr. Helmut. Any sick ones? Around fifteen, more or less. More or less... Here everything is more or less. This year we've had 37 casualties. The wolfram cannot wait. Mérquez, send a letter to the Prison Board asking them to send us more prisoners. What's up? Don't you remember the statement? They wont send more prisoners. Franco is giving the Allies... I'd like to get more prisoners, but I can't do anything. Are there no more people at the village? They deal it on the black market. They make more money. The Civil Guard ought to have a heavier hand with the thieves. These people are poor... and wolfram is paid dearly, especially by Allied spies... Spain... is indebted to us... Someone ought to make this clear to your people. Yes, Mr. Franz. We'll do all we can. We'll double shifts to meet the workload. I feel like getting out of this hole and going back to Germany. This hole, as you say, ...could hide what I've always been looking for. The most important thing now is to win the war. Everything is important. Wait. What's up? These are the plans of the mines. Didn't they tell you anything else? How much time do we have? We are ready. There are four of us, enough to dig the hole. I'll tell the foreigners. Did you tell them what I almost did? Better that way. Don't you ever think about your wife... about your children? And you? I never married. Who are you mourning for, then? For a scoundrel, hopefully rotting away in a cemetery. We must leave. I don't want anyone to see I left. Will she get better? It'll lake some time, but I think she will. She's a very strong girl. You shouldn't touch her with your hands. It's so sticky. Its arsenic. Poison. Did you give Miguel the plans? He has three men ready to start digging. Why did you choose him? He is brave. He took part in the siege to the Shrine at Andújar. They commuted his death sentence to forced labor for life. He has nothing to lose... And his family? Nobody's waiting for him. Poor man. Candela! What is the water for? For her to wash... And who are you? She can't understand you. Her name's Ruth. She came from far away, from the war. She's a Jew. The Germans are persecuting them. What the hell do we care? Haven't we got enough problems as it is? She needs to cross over to Portugal, but the river was swollen and I was afraid she might drown... You're crazy. The Engineer! What's he doing here? Tell her to sit down. At the table, now! Peel potatoes, peel. - To peel potatoes - Yes, yes. Quiet! Tsch. Peel! Candela! Good morning. This is my sister Candela. And this is our cousin... Isabel. Sorry if I'm interrupting. Potatoes. Back in Germany that's' all I ate. And it's the same here. I didn't know you lived with your cousin. She's just visiting... Isabel lives in Outeiro. If you need anything... Yes, sorry... If you're not too busy... could you accompany me to Teixadal? Of course. I don't want you to get lost in that forest full of wolves. I hope we'll meet again. What do they say about the yew grove? They're just old wives' tales. Tell me about those tales. In this forest there's a hidden cave, the Cova dos Mouros... where strong, powerful men lived thousands of years ago. And this cave... Where is it? They say that my grandmother was the only one who knew the way. Are you sure? I told you, they're just old wives' tales. A well-read man like you cant believe in such things... This place is special. I know you can feel it too. I won't stop until I find out what's hidden here. NO! Spit that out! They're poisonous. I know. I knew I could trust you. There's a storm approaching. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24... 25, 26, 27, 28, 29... 30, 31, 32, 33... Musician, did you count how many meters from the washing site? About 30 meters. There's noway we can do this. Are you sure? The abandoned gallery must be here somewhere... These plans are as old as the hills. Everything's been re-built. These plans are useless. They're shit. Damn motherfuckers! So now what? We have to take the plans from the Nazi guy. Manuela's been seen around the house... Maybe she could take them. Tobacco. I had it. It'll go to waste. Thanks. The plans you gave me are useless. We don't know where to start digging. So what are you going to do? The Engineer must keep the plans at the house... in the office or some other room. Why are you telling me this? Because you're the only one who can get them. I already did enough. It wouldn't be the first time you're alone at home with him. That's none of your business. Do whatever you have to do. Don't you ever disrespect me again. Do you hear me? Never! You don't understand. We are not important. Manuela, my daughter. Look what Candela bought. What is she doing here? What's wrong with you? You told me you'd take her away. She'll have dinner with us. Do you want us to get caught? The neighbors would easily go and give us away to the German guy. No one's seen her. And there you go on a spending spree. We deserve something good. So does she. Shut up, Candela, shut up! Come on! Stand up, get out! You have no heart. I have a fatherless daughter. And I can't allow anything to happen to me. If you want to play tough it's up to you. But do it away from home. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... 11, 12, 13, 14, 15... 16, 17, 18, 19, 20... 21, and 22... 22 in C. And now, everyone off to sleep! Tomorrow ain't no holiday. Take it, please... Please. Where's your baby? The baby... Your son. Where is he? We must go. I'll bring her something to dry herself. Beware Faster! Faster! Not so fast, please. Brake! Brake, softly. How much is a car like this worth? Tu es belle. What? If I kissed you right now, what would happen to me? The mine plans. I hope this works. Did you take them from him? It's what you wanted, isn't it? If I could've done it myself, I wouldn't have allowed you to -- Allow? Who are you to allow me anything? I didn't it for you. Manuela. You were right. We're not important. Alba? She went to fetch the cow with mother. And this? Sagrario, the seamstress's daughter, brought it. For you. It's Franz's signature. And the number 8. Hey! Is it my turn? You were in seventh heaven. Since when have you got this awful cough? Since the war ended. Virutas, this is no joke. It's silicosis. You'll rest tonight. No. Yes. No. Tonight you watch over the barracks and we'll carry on. You're going to miss these arms. When the wolfram is out, we'll escape through the tunnel. The first thing we'll do is take you to a doctor to cure you. Well, I'll invite you all to my sisters', to my village... and I'll cook you a real finger-licking stew. Do you like stew? Now, look at the poor widow! You may go now. The dress looks beautiful on you. I'm not used to luxury. You should be. A woman like you... deserves the best. Are we celebrating something? The good luck of having known you. Deutschland über alles! I was in the Teixadal. I tried to find the cave you told me about. What I am looking for... is proof that the soul resides in all things. And it might be in that cave. I know you understand me. We could convert that forest into a place of pilgrimage. Will you help me find that cave? I don't know where it is, I told you so. I don't think it even exists. In a few days... we will send a large shipment of wolfram for the German army. Together we can do great things, Manuela. The warehouse! Now it's up to the Guerrilla to do their job. Gentlemen! You may go back and dream with the Pasionaria. In three hours time you'll rise and get back to work. Sections B and C! Count them! 25 in C, first barracks. What's up? They're counting next door. What's the matter with you, Virutas? I'm waiting for my girlfriend. His girlfriend... Are you done with the clown act or... or is there more coming? Mérquez. Did anyone ever tell you that under the moonlight... you're even uglier? Virutas. Get inside or I'll beat you up. Get inside. Get inside! Let me go, fuck! Stop, Virutas! Stop or I'll shoot! Long live the Republic, you bastards! Hold it! Hold it! Stop! Hold it! Leave him there. Let him take the body to the infirmary. Tell them we've reached the warehouse. The guerrilla will reach the gallery tonight. You should let them take care of the wolfram. You've done your job. We're not going to stand by and do nothing. Why are you so stubborn? Don't you care if you die? As if you care. And now leave, please. Go, go. I told you to leave. This will protect you. He's talking to London. What is he telling them? The Americans are finally preparing something important. What are they saying? It's still secret. But we cannot fail if we keep going like this! Thank God! Thank God! Looks like things are about to change for the Nazis. If we manage to stop the Armament Works... Hey, hey. Of course we will manage it. This calls for a celebration! Bryan, don't bring tea! OK. It could be the end of the war. And they'll stop persecuting the Jews. It'll be the end of it all! We can go home in peace. You must be glad. What you have done is very important. One day, when this is all over... the world will know what you've done and you'll be a hero... You've washed yourself a lot lately. Nothing wrong with that And your eyes shine in a special way... especially when you're off to see Bryan and Edgar. Candela, what's wrong? Did something happen with Edgar? Did he kiss you? Edgar kisses a lot and talks a lot. And what does he say? I have to go. Wait Candela! Candela, wait! Take this! Candela. Candela! Candela, wait! Wait, please. What's happening with Edgar? Who cares? When the war is over he'll leave. He told you that? Edgar can have any woman. He's an important doctor. Why would he stay with me? I can't even write my own name. So what? I don't want to get my hopes up. I don't want to go through what you did. Candela. Listen to me. You're the best person I've ever known. And you deserve the best in this world. Including Edgar and his kisses. We are looking for a Jew. He's trying to get to Portugal. We must find him. The guerrilla is here. Navas? Is that you, Navas? Edgar went to meet up with the guerrilla. He won't be long. It's late and the river's low. We have to take advantage of it. We must wait until they steal the wolfram. Take it easy. I'll brew you some tea while you wail. Tea? This man needs something stronger than tea. You're right. Damn it! What about the car? Candela took the car. I told Candela to wait for you. Important warning: Gestapo men seen in your area. In search of escaped Jew. Come on! Run! There she is! Come on! She'll talk. I know her. She's just a peasant. And I want to know who else helped him! He couldn't make it all the way to Spain unaided! Do you know who that man you helped is? A murderer. An enemy of Germany. He told me nothing. What is she saying? I'll handle this. How many more have you 'assisted? Did your sister know? She didn't do anything. Candela. I dont think you're aware of what you've done. But if you want my help... you must tell the truth. I met him in the woods. He was lost, and I accompanied him. All by yourself? Yes. By yourself. You are going to tell me the truth. Shit! Come on! We have to finish. Halt! Stop o I'll shoot! Run, run! Let's go! What about the others? I don't know. We've got to go, come on. Come on. Hold him! Don't move, you bastard! What news do you bring? They say Candela has confessed. She told what Miguel was doing in the mine. They've killed one of the guerrilla. - Did they kill him? - Yes. I don't understand. Candela wouldn't give the game away. And do you know when they're going to release Candela? Why would they release her? What do you know, mother? Who have you been talking to? The German guy said that... He was so kind... I told him everything and he said he would release Candela. Mother... You don't know what you've done. Berlin expects us to ship the wolfram now. - If we were to report the theft... - We cannot mention the theft. Three ions are missing and the boat is waiting in Vigo. Well, let it wail! What are we going to do? The prisoners will work day and night. And so we'll recover part of the wolfram in no time. All right. First we execute the conspirators. We can't do that. lf we do it, Franco will kick us out. The Allies have him cornered. Franco is a nobody. I wouldn't have gone without her. Do you think she knew? Do you think she knew how much I love her? If she didn't know then she does now. That's why we can't give up. Candela risked her life for people she didn't even know. We owe her. I owe her. There's too few of us and we don't have enough weapons. The war won't last forever. The Germans are weakening... And when is that going to be? Who knows. And when it happens, they'll all be dead. - Let's free Miguel and Casamayor. - No. We must free them all. We'll talk tomorrow. - It isn't a good idea, Manuela. The war... - It isn't the war! It's not just the war. It's the life of a few men who risked their lives for you. We owe it to them. The ministry decreed the full and immediate seizure of the mines and all stored wolfram. Waiting for your prompt resolution and handover of facilities. The Allies advance across Europe. The Russians have destroyed Army Group Centre and they're at the gates of Warsaw. Hitler wants us to regroup in Germany. We have failed. I'll prepare our departure. Wait. Before we go we'll have to take care of the prisoners. They are to blame for our failure. If we had gotten the wolfram necessary... But these people are like animals. They don't understand anything. And neither do you. - The prisoners and the mines belong to Spain and I cannot allow - Now you defend them? I'm just following orders. Until we're gone, I'm the only who gives orders here. Halt! What are you carrying? Coffins? Let's see! Are you going to play a concert? My wife really knew how to play the piano. Thick, long hair down to her waist. Sometimes I can't remember her face... Come on, ladies! Cheer up your ugly faces! Today we're celebrating something special! Sr. Franz is very pleased with your work. Everyone to the barracks! Come on, let's go! Musician. There'll be wine for you too. Come on! Come on, back to the barrack! Come on! Get inside! Faster! Where are they taking them? Let's go around the back. I'm going to see what's going on. I need to pee. No one can leave. Want me to do it here? Look out that window! Dynamite! It's all going to blow up! We have to gel out of here! Let's open the door. Back! Casamayor, everybody get out. Come on! Get down! Come on! Quick! The guerrilla have entered the mines, we must go now! Is the dynamite in place? Yes, but Marquez fled. That bastard... I have to light the dynamite. The truck is ready. Come on now! Wait for me at the entrance. Come on down! Come on! Miguel! - Are you okay? - Yes, yes... That lunatic has put dynamite in the barracks. I've got to make sure there aren't any prisoners left inside. - Don't go, I'll come with you... - Get out of here and wait for me in the forest. - No Miguel, please... - Do as I say. We must get out of here. Miguel. Get out! Casamayor, anybody left? - No one left! We must leave, fast! - Let's go! Come on, we're not waiting for anyone! Detonators are on! Start! Start! Halt! Halt! Stop the truck! We cannot wait. I'll reach you at the inn down the road. Let her be. It's all over now. Miguel? Why, Manuela? Why? Don't you realize I'm the only one who understands you? Why did you betray me? Why? I know where to find what you're looking for. You musn't die lying, Manuela. And you musn't leave without what you came for. Here it is. You go in first. Carry on. Stand still. Move over. It must be here. At last. I'm not afraid of wolves. Not am I. The 'El Eje' Mine Prison Outpost, in Ourense, supplied wolfram to the Nazi army from November of 1942 to July of 1944, when it was closed by Franco under Allied pressure. 461 political prisoners and hundreds of villagers worked there. The Touza sisters, from Ribadavia, helped more than 400 Jews escape to America via Portugal between 1942 and 1945. A tree was planted in their memory on the hills around Jerusalem.
