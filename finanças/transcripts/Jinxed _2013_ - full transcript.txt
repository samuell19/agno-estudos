- My name is Meg Murphy. This is my street. And this is my house. [Alarm clock ringing] That's me. Hi. [Sighs] Okay, not the best first impression. Let's skip ahead. Much better. So as I was saying, I'm Meg Murphy, and today begins what I know will be the greatest summer ever. Being me can be exhausting. My life is a little... Strange. But it's not just me. My whole family is different. Hi, mom. - Good morning. - Morning, trouble. Morning, dad. - Good morning, beautiful. No, not you, Harold. Yes, you do have beautiful eyes. - We may look normal, but we're not like other families exactly. - So how did you sleep? - Great. I was only woken up once when a bat flew into my room and got stuck in my pillowcase. - Oh, that's good. That's so much better than the angry badgers from last week. - Yeah. - Well, it looks like somebody's summer is getting off to a good start. I know you don't like bacon. There's cereal up there. - Easy enough. Just go get that cereal up there on the shelf, right? Just use the ladder or a stool. - And the second one... [Murmuring indistinctly] [Cereal clattering] - [Gasps] - [Gasps] - [Gasps] [Whispering] Nobody move. - Hi, baby. [Baby cooing] Yeah, give mommy the orange. Give mommy the orange, baby. Give mommy the orange. Okay, give it to mommy. That's a good girl. Give mommy the orange-- no! [Ice clattering] - Oh-ho-ho! - Oh! Ugh! - Ooh! Oh, not the bacon. [Electrical zapping] - [Gasps] [Electrical zapping] [All sigh] [Explosion] [All screaming] [Wood creaking] - Okay, troops, time to evacuate. - Charlie, time to go. - Be right there, dad! - Whoo-hoo! [Laughing] Whoa! - Oh, I know. It's such a bummer. - Oh, that was so awesome. I got it on video. - Walk briskly to the exit, everyone. - Okay, kids, grab your emergency suitcases. [Crashing] - Okay, boys and girls, time to go. - Now I know. - Out the door, Charlie. - Move, move, move. - Let's go! Let's go! [Crashing] - It's a good thing we have insurance on speed dial, huh? - Yeah. Come on, Charlie. [Crashing] [Dog barking] - Let me get my camera. - Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Charlie, I'll get it. Heh. Hey. It still works. [Rumbling] [Crashing] - Not again. [Mischievous instrumental music] ¶ ¶ [bees buzzing] Clank! [Birds chirping] [Water hissing] [Crashing] Splorch! [Horn honking] [Bird squawking] [Bird honking] Boof! [Baby powder shaking] [Baby cooing] [Bees buzzing] [Glass shatters] [Bees buzzing] [People screaming] - I wish I were normal. I wish I could tell you that our house falling down was a once-in-a-lifetime thing. But this was the fourth time it had happened. This year. The local hotels have all politely told us we're never, ever allowed back. So this time we're staying with our grandpa in harvest hills. Boing! - Oh! Honey. Oh. Honey. - Okay. - Yeah, I'm stuck. No, it's even worse. - Okay, stop, just-- - yeah, okay, go ahead. - Let me. - Yeah, just-- okay, got it? [Gasps] That's the sweet spot... - Here's the deal: My family is jinxed. 100 years ago, a witch put a magical curse on my great great grandfather Tommy Murphy, and now every Murphy since then has been stuck with bad luck. This isn't just any bad luck. I mean, reputation-tanking, life-frazzling bad luck. We call it Murphy's law. If anything can go wrong, it will. But we figured out how to deal with it. When you're a Murphy, you have to see things a little bit differently than everyone else. - [Makes buzzer noise] - What? - What? - Gangy! - Mom and dad taught us being a Murphy makes us special, but that's a little harder to believe now that I'm in high school. As you can imagine, being a walking disaster does not equal popularity. People tend to run away from me, hurricane Meg. [Water hissing] You might think I'm exaggerating the whole curse, that I'm just accident-prone. Nope. The curse is real. [Water hissing] [Bucket clattering] It's magic, and it's out to get me. I want to do something important with my life, like become a famous scientist and discover the cure for pimples. [Substance gurgling] [Explosion] [Kids gasping] But it turns out science is no match for an evil spell. I guess I should settle for just trying not to kill anybody. - Next up, Meg Murphy. - I've tried to be normal, but I don't even need to finish this sentence because I'm sure you've already figured out how that worked out for me. Ready? Okay. - Oh! - But in the whole history of Murphys, no one's figured out how to break the curse. Whenever I ask my parents about it, they change the subject. Twang! [Suitcases clattering] [Tires squealing] - Hi. Sorry about this. [Horn honking] Let me grab it. Honk! My house is-- hold on a sec. - Come on! - Ha-ha! Oh, this is awkward. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'll go. [Horn honking] - If this curse had a magical cause, it must have a magical solution. I've got to find it this summer so I can leave all this baggage behind me and start high school, normal. - [Sighs] Home sweet home for the time being. This'll be fun, right, gang? Hanging with grandpa. 24/7. - Oh, I totally forgot about the second floor balcony. It's perfect for a skating trick. Oh, I can fly up the ramp to the railing, and then I could jump to the roof and then skate the roof Ridge, and then Ollie back to the windowsill and grind it, and then fall from my board and crash onto the side of the house. Oh, dad, you could totally film it. It would be epic. - That's my annoying little brother, Charlie. You might recognize him as Internet sensation skater fail boy. He's famous for his videos of him doing crazy skating tricks. And failing. It's, like, his thing. Clunk! [Kids cheering] - [Laughing] Yeah! - Uh-uh-uh-uh! Just stay epic down here on the ground, buddy. - The Murphy's have a strict policy against heights. I mean, even people who aren't cursed get hurt falling from high places. Charlie's the only one who ignores the family motto. All: Climb over three feet, you're dead meat. - Um... What's that? - Yeah, why does the front door look like it's about to fart. Thoonk! - [Grunting] Whoa. - Grandpa has had the curse a lot longer than any of us, and has found interesting ways to deal with it. - Hi, dad. - [Laughing] Oh, hi. - Hey, grandpa. A giant bubble, huh? That's new. - Yeah, great find, right? I never go outside without it now. Never. [Geese honking] Look. It's a flock of migrating geese. [Splatting] - [Squeals] - Majestic creatures. [Door closes] [Grunting] Oh, I'm so happy you're all here. [Chuckling] I can't believe how much you've grown. Now, kids, you remember where your rooms are, right? Get! - Wow. I love what you've done with the place, dad. All the memories and-- no, don't even think about it. - Be careful. I haven't had time to baby-proof the house yet. See, all this is just Murphy-proofed. - Since my baby sister Georgia can't walk yet, the curse doesn't affect her too much for now. But it sure does make mom's life harder. - My little Georgia want some peaches? Here it comes. [Makes airplane sounds] [Baby coos] [Flashbulbs popping] Okay. So that's a no on the peaches. - Oh, uh, this... Was dropped off for you earlier, son. I... - [Gasps] Oh-ho-ho-ho. Test case number 456 for Murphy's machinations. - [Chuckles] - Murphy's machinations is my dad's company. It's hard to keep a job when you're cursed by Murphy's law. - Thanks. Have a good day. Bye-bye. Oh. Uh... Smack! Hi. [Whistling] Whoa! Whoa! [Garbling] - But dad found a way to turn the curse into a business opportunity. He tests out new products for defects. This glue is guaranteed to create a lifetime hold. Not much of a guarantee if you ask me. If there's a flaw, I'll find it and help you fix it. If something can go wrong, it will with mark Murphy. - We're still rolling. [Dial tone] - Wow. Wow. Looks expensive. Can't wait to break it. They call it the insta cookie 3000. It's made by matayama industries. If I could figure out what could go wrong with this by Monday, they said I could test all their products, which could mean big time... [Clicks teeth] For the whole family. - Wait. What's this mean? - Money. - Oh. Hey, dad, can I have some of this? - [Laughs] No. - Ah, the Murphy wall of fame, huh? Oh. [Laughs] This one's daddy. [Laughs] [Clears throat] Okay, I know it's not your best scenario for your summer. - Best? Try even worse than my worst nightmare. - Okay. Well, I know it's not home, but harvest hills is a nice little town. I think you could have a lot of fun here. Oh, oh, look. A science camp for teenagers at the university. You just fill out the application. - Seriously, mom? Do you know what would happen if a Murphy was let loose in a science lab? [Monster roaring] [People screaming] I'm sorry! I didn't think you could actually release the kraken. - [Sighs] - What? We're cursed. It could happen. - Meg, everyone has problems. It is not just us, okay? How you handle it is what matters. - You know the best way to handle our problems? Get rid of the curse. - [Laughing] Okay, sweetie. Could you just let let go, maybe, and enjoy your vacation? - But there's got to be a way. I mean, I can't go through three more years of high school as hurricane Meg. - [Sighs] You know what? I know. I know what will make you feel better. Here. Yes, I am paying you off to be a happy daughter. Seriously, you should just go and buy yourself a whole new summer wardrobe. You deserve it. - My suitcase got left behind? - Yeah. - ¶ It's a cruel ¶ ¶ cruel summer ¶ ¶ leaving me here on my own ¶ ¶ it's a cruel ¶ ¶ cruel summer ¶ ¶ now you're gone ¶ ¶ you're not the only one ¶ [kids screaming distantly] ¶ The city is crowded ¶ ¶ my friends are away ¶ - oh. - Oh. You. - Ivy Murray. Aka the meanest girl in the history of mean girls, aka the bane of my existence, aka-- oh, no. - What are you doing here? - Well, my grandpa lives here, so-- - here? In harvest hills? But this is my town. I come here every summer, and you're not invited. - Trust me. I am just as unhappy about this as you are. - My summer's ruined. My life is ruined. Give me that. This town is supposed to be a hurricane Meg-free zone. - Of all the towns we could have come to this summer, it had to be here? Harvest hills is horrible. This is going to be the worst summer ever. - Hold on. I found these monkey socks first. And finders keepers. These must be yours. - Yeah. - I would definitely rock those socks, though. - Thanks. I'm embarrassed. - Well, hi, embarrassed. I'm Brett. - It's Meg, actually. - Well, nice to meet you, Meg. Are you from harvest hills? I haven't seen you before. - No, I'm just here visiting my bees. I mean, my grandpa. Well, not visiting. I guess I'm kind of living here this summer. My house, it, uh, kind of fell down. So many bees. - Well, welcome. You're actually just in time for the harvest festival. - I can see. - There's tons of fun stuff to do. It lasts all week. And every year they pick one person to lower the flag at the closing ceremony. Guess who they picked this year. - Who? I have no idea. Wait. Is it you? - Yes. Jeez. Took you long enough. I'll have you know it's a very big honor. Get to shake hands with the mayor. Get a really snazzy t-shirt. - You know, we can never have too many t-shirts. - [Chortles] - Smooth, Meg. - Well, anyway, um, you should come. There's gonna be a picnic and a fair. And a dance. You've got to come to the dance. - I do? - Sure. It's a town tradition. You don't want to hurt the town's feelings, do you? - I guess not. - Um... Let me help you with the rest of these. - Thanks. OMG, he doesn't know I'm hurricane Meg. Mom was right. Harvest hills is awesome. This is gonna be the best summer ever. If only this bee would leave me alone. Smack! - Ow! - Oh, I am so sorry. I really didn't mean to. - Wow. You got a strong right hook there, Meg. - Oh, my god. - Oh! - I'm so sorry. No, no, it was an accident. Here you go. It was very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Sorry. - It's okay. don't worry about it. - Okay, curse, this means war. - Butt balloon activate! - Sorry, grandpa. Cool invention. - Oh, it's handy for napping anywhere. - This stupid curse is ruining my life. I mean, look at the things this family has gone through. "Hiccupping man causes circus stampede." Okay, "man throws coin in fountain, floods town." - That was a lot of water. - "Local youth invents homework." The Murphys invented homework? Really? [Both murmuring] - It's been 100 years. Why has no one ever tried to break it? - Oh, we've tried. - Dad. - Oh. - What? Grandpa, is there a way to break the curse? - There are certain things a Murphy must never do-- needlepoint, whale watching. But messing with the curse is at the top of the list. - So you admit you've tried it. What do you do? Do you got to a fortune-teller or do a seance or find a spell in a book? - [Gasps] - Ha! There's a book. - Enough, Meg. We've told you before that the curse can't be broken. So don't make yourself miserable by trying. - Okay, so I guess I should just stay miserable not trying. - That is not what I meant. - Trust us, Meg. There are fates worse than Murphy's law. - She's getting too curious. She doesn't know the chaos that she can cause. She'll-- - she won't find the diary, son. - But if she did-- - won't. - I'm just saying--- - shush. - I'm playing devil's-- - nope. - Every time I-- - no. - I looked everywhere for this--this book, but things are easily hidden in grandpa's big old house. And I probably should have remembered Murphy rule 51. [Sighs] [Sniffs] Never use matches. [Explosion] Whoa! [Grunts] [Coughing] Grandpa was right. I didn't find the diary. The diary found me. [Chortles] - Hey, hey to all my fans. I just made a new invention that's gonna make my videos even more awesome than before. The dizzy cam. World, you are so not ready for this. - Dude, this is gonna be so rad. - Dude, I know, right? - Let's go. - All right. - Go, go, go! - You got this! Whoa! - Charlie's never landed a trick thanks to Murphy's curse. But he doesn't care. He doesn't even try to be a good skater. His fans just want to see a cyclone on wheels. - Yeah! - [Gasps] - Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Whoa. - [Chuckles] [People cheering] - [Laughing] Yeah! - June 22, 1914. - Hi, honey. I'm gonna run to the store because Georgia has graduated to the industrial strength diapers. So, uh, I could drop you off in town. You could go do things. Kids your age, they have places they like to go, hang out, right? You could get down. - No, thanks, mom. - You sure? - Yeah. - Okay. - Bye. - "Tonight is the harvest dance, and I, Tommy Murphy..." - Am the luckiest man around. [Fountain splashing] [Indistinct chatter] A man once said to me, "Tommy Murphy, you're the luckiest guy around." And you know what? Today I feel like I am. [People cheering] [Frogs croaking] [Cheering] [Cheering] [Cheering] Yes! Yeah! [Laughing] [Upbeat fiddle music] ¶ ¶ and tonight I bet I'm gonna end up with the prettiest girl in town. - Hi, Tommy. - No, not Violet. Caitlin O'Leary. Now, some townsfolk think she's a witch, but I think that's just silly. Everyone knows there's no such thing as magic. Although she's certainly put a spell on me. [Chortles] - Will you dance with me, Tommy? - I don't know. I'm not a very good dancer. But I'll tell you what. I will let my lucky coin decide. Heads, yes. Tails... [Both laugh] [Stirring string music] ¶ ¶ [grunts] - Tommy. - Mm, mm-- no! Caitlin. No, it's-- it's not what it looks like. Caitlin, wait! Caitlin, stop! [Dress ripping] - [Gasps] - Caitlin! Caitlin. Caitlin, come on. Come back to the dance. - I never want to talk to you again, Tommy Murphy. - Violet means nothing to me. So you're wearing grandma's underwear. I don't care. - [Sniffs] You still want to dance with me? I'll flip you for it. Heads, the answer is yes. Tails... [Magical shimmering] I curse you and every other no-good Murphy forever. [Wind whistling] - What's a stupid coin know anyway? Caitlin, wait! Splorch! - Unbelievable. We've suffered generations because people saw her underwear? "I don't want to complain, but..." - Ever since that day, things haven't been going so well for me here in harvest hills. [Horn honking] A man came up to me today, and he said, "Tommy Murphy, you are the unluckiest guy around." And he was right. Things that were easy for me weren't easy anymore. I tried to find Caitlin. I wanted to talk to her. - You may kiss the bride. - But I was too late. [People laughing and cheering] - Congratulations. [Cheers and applause] [Horse whinnies] - [Grunting] But I wasn't giving up. I was gonna find a way to break the curse. - Very interesting. - Even if it killed me. - [Gasps] - Ah! Which, the way things were going, it might. [Coughing] - I finally found the answer. Yes, this is it! "All I have to do to lift the curse is..." [Water splashing] [Electrical zapping] Yes! [Electrical zapping] Ow! Ha-ha. You stupid curse. You hit me two seconds too late. I already know everything about how to stop you. Caitlin O'Leary, your reign of terror has gone on long enough. [Wind whistling] [Beeping] [Machine whirring] [Machine beeps] [Beeping] [Alarm beeping] [Explosion] - Off to an excellent start. Yeah. [Sighs] - There you are. Sweet. - Hello, sweetheart. How are you? Good. Good talk. [Coughs] - Every step I take gets me closer to my goal of being normal, of being just like everyone else, of not being hurricane Meg. I'm gonna find that coin and... [Groans] What now? - Meg. Oh, Meg. I've been all over town looking for you. - What for? - Can't it just be because I love my sister? All right, I need 50 bucks. Meg, wait. There's a skating competition this summer, and I'm gonna rock it, build up my fan base. Get cur-a-zy. Only I can't afford the entrance fee. - Okay, then why don't you ask mom and dad? - They said I had to pay for it myself. - Okay, then why are you asking me? - Because I consider you a patron of the arts. - [Scoffs] - Come on, Meg. Help me give the people what they want. Loan the money? - No. But you can earn it helping me break the Murphy curse. - Whoa! Wait, wait, wait. - [Screams] - Oh, my gosh. Ivy, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? It was... An accident. - You being born was an accident. - If it makes you feel any better, that was a pretty sweet wipeout. - Who is this person speaking to me? - My brother. - There are more of you? Ugh! Let's go. - Jeez, what's her problem? - So much for making friends in harvest hills. - Sorry, Meg. Okay, so let me get this straight. You want to break the curse, but you were warned not to, which makes me want to help, but how do I get my money? - "If the curse you want lifted, "find the object that was flipp-ed. "Give it to the next O'Leary, but be sure they take it cheery." - Yeah, I don't get it. - It's the key to breaking the curse. Great great grandpa Tommy was cursed with a magic coin. That's what was flipped. If we give it back to someone who's related to that witch woman Caitlin O'Leary before the end of the harvest dance, we can end the curse forever. We just have to find that coin. - But, Meg, how are we supposed to find some coin from 100 years ago? It's not like he put an ad in the paper saying where he spent it. - Actually, he kind of did. - "Man throws coin in fountain, floods town"? - Tommy threw the coin in the fountain to try and wish the curse away. It didn't work, and the coin caused a crack in the fountain that flooded downtown. Typical Murphy. - So where's this fountain? [Water splashing] Hey, Meg. I found it. There it is. I solved the mystery. - Go. - Which one is it? - It's a 100-year-old coin. I'm sure it's got to stand out. - Hey, Meg! - Brett. - Quarters, pennies... - Um, sorry. - Whoa! [Splashing] What the? - Hey. - It's my favorite boxer. How does my nose look? Is it crooked? - Your nose is perfect. I mean, perfectly straight. I'm sorry. After what I did, I thought you'd want to stay away from me. I'm a mess. - Are you kidding? Of course not. You seem like a really cool mess. Harvest hills can be a pretty boring place. But I feel like hanging out with you, I wouldn't be bored at all. Bleeding and terrified, maybe, but not boring. [Fountains hissing] - [Spluttering] Hey! Hey, come on! I could use some help here. A lot of coins, and I only have two hands! - Is that kid trying to take money out of the fountain? - Probably just some crazy person. You were saying something about hanging out with me? [Fountains hissing] - [Grunts] - As long as you promise to warn me if you're gonna punch me again. - I can't make any promises. These babies have a mind of their own. - [Laughs] So I see your reading up on the town history. - Oh, this. Yeah, um, just a big fan of history. - Oh, me too. Yeah, I actually used to volunteer at the town historical society. They have a whole display on the fountain flood that destroyed harvest hills. - And the stupid little coin that started it. - Wow. You really do know the history. - [Grunting] - It's kind of crazy how a small thing like that could cause such a mess. They have the actual coin on display there. - They do? I mean, oh. That's cool. [Bells ringing] - [Grunting] Uh-oh. - [Clears throat] So... I was wondering... - Whoa, whoa, whoa! If maybe you would, um... - Oh, my gosh. Is he going to ask me out? No, don't be ridiculous, Meg. Why would-- - do you want to go to the harvest festival dance with me? - Sure. [Chuckles] Why not? - Awesome. - [Screaming] - Anyway, um... I should go. And I will see you later. - All right. Bye. - All right. Bye. While you were playing in the water, I just solved the mystery of the coin. We just have to figure out how to get it. - [Spits] [Heavy mechanized breathing] - Okay, let's spread out. Hi, baby. Hi, Georgie. It's peaches. - Excuse me, everyone. I have an announcement to make. I have a date to the harvest dance. - [Gasps] [Laughter and cheering] - Yeah, Meg! [Wood crashing] [Cheering] [Knocking on door] - Hey. I have a surprise for you. Close your eyes. Ta-da. It's for the dance. - [Chortles] - It's fireproof, stain proof, wrinkle proof, and short enough you won't trip on it. - I love it. Thank you so much. - [Chuckles] Let's see. [Gasps] Oh, honey. Oh. [Sniffs] [Chortles] You know, the harvest dance is where your father took me on our first date. It was the most romantic night of my whole life. Even after your father got sprayed by not one, but two different skunks. [Sighs] - I'm so happy. - Yeah. Mm, you see? It's like I always told you. The curse doesn't matter as long as you have the right attitude, right? - Wrong. I was happy because I was a day away from breaking the curse. Right. - Hmm. - Well, I think we can agree, it's time for this a-cha-ching-cha-ching. - And what does that mean? - Money? I mean, you got to pay up. I helped you look for the coin. - Yeah, right. You don't get paid until we break the curse. And we still don't have the coin or know who Caitlin's descendants are. You have earned zero dollars. - Aw, jeez. You know, you're going through a lot of trouble just for some boy. - I'm not doing this for some boy. I'm doing this for us, for our family, so our lives can finally be normal. - Meg... I don't know if I want my life to be normal. - What are you talking about? - It's just, what about my skating? If we break the curse, then... I won't be a master of destruction anymore. - [Scoffs] don't worry, buddy. Even without the curse, you're probably still a terrible skater. - Thanks, Meg. - The dance is tomorrow, so we're breaking into that historical building tonight. And we need to get a coin and find out who's related to Caitlin O'Leary. - All right. Heist time! - Shh. [Whispering] Heist time. [Owl hooting] - [Sighs] - What? It's the only black clothes I own. - Okay, but why bring the wand? - [Sighs] [Dog barking distantly] All of harvest hills' historical treasure is guarded by impenetrable security, but I have a plan. We'll get in from above through the skylight. You will repel to the roof, then through the skylight with glass cutters. I'll create a distraction here to mask the noise. Here's where it gets a little tricky. You've seen spider-man, right? Take these suction cups and... - Hey, sweet. It's unlocked. - Can do it that way. Come on. - [Groans] - [Whispering] don't make any sound, and don't touch anything. - Like there's anything in here I'd want to touch. Hey, check it out. She's picking my nose. - Stop messing around. - [Sighs] I've no idea what you're saying. - I'm gonna go look over there. - Fine. You go look for the coin. I'm gonna try and find the town records. - Uh! Whoa. Ha-ha. Meg, I got it. I found the coin. - Nice. - Aw, yeah. I saw the target, and I acquired it. I slipped in and out of the shadows silent and undetected. Yep. I'm pretty much a ninja. [Clattering] - Shh. [Keys jingling] Quick. Hide. [Keys jingling] [Jingling footsteps] - [Grunting] [Clattering] - Hm. [Door closes] Man, that was so close. - Okay. I figured it out. If Caitlin O'Leary had a baby, and that baby had a baby, and on and on for five generations, then this book shows everyone who's related to them. It goes all the way down to present day. So according to this, the most recent descendent of Caitlin O'Leary and the person we have to give the coin to is... Oh. - Well, who is it? - Ivy. I should have guessed. The girl who dubbed me hurricane Meg is the descendent of the woman who caused the hurricane in the first place. - Target acquired. - I'm gonna get into position. - ¶ All the lights, turn them off ¶ ¶ it's too loud in here to talk ¶ ¶ I don't understand a word you're saying ¶ ¶ I'm trying to sleep, but instead ¶ ¶ karaoke on the bed ¶ - as I watched Ivy, I couldn't help thinking, what if this curse somehow sensed I was about to break it? It would do anything it could to stop me. I would have to be more careful than ever if I wanted to survive long enough to-- - hey, Meg. Hey, Meg, does this thing work? - Stop interrupting my inner monologue. Yes, it works, Charlie. You don't have to scream. Where are you? - Tonight my name is nighthawk, and I'm up in the lights. I'm a go. - I'm not calling you nighthawk. - Please? Please, please, please? - Oh, my god, okay, fine. - What's fine? - Uh, you. You're looking... Fine. - [Makes retching noise] - Ha, shut up. I mean, wow. I should shut up. I mean, hi. - Uh, hi to you too. You look really pretty tonight. Do you want to go get some punch? - No, me and punch are a bad idea, with the spilling and whatnot. - Get your raffle tickets. What about you, young lady? - Oh, no, thank you. - You could win an all-expense-paid trip to the grand canyon. - Trust me. I won't win. Not in 100 years. 0% chance. - Here you go. - What's the name for the ticket? - Meg Murphy. Thanks. So I present to you as a "thank you" for being my date a 0% chance of winning a vacation. Or maybe tonight your luck will change. - Thank you. And I hope so. - Oh, and it's also your lucky day because you get to embarrass yourself on the dance floor with me right now. But I have to warn you. I got moves. It's the lawnmower. What? It's the running man. I'm a sprinkler. - Stop, stop, I can't take it. You're too good. - [Laughs] Shall we? - Yes. - Remember the mission. Target's in the refreshment area. - I mean, no. I mean, I have to go get something. I'll be right back. - Okay. - Nighthawk, cover me. I'm going in. - Hey, Meg, I was thinking about the rhyme of the curse. You know, "give it to the next O'Leary, make sure they take it cheery." You know, I was thinking you could tell her a joke, like, "knock-knock." "Who's there?" "Give me the coin." "Give me the coin who?" And then give her the coin. - Yeah, no. I think I'll just wing it. Ah! [Gasps] [Fabric ripping] [Gasps] - My skirt. Meg Murphy! - I am so sorry. - This night was supposed to be special. You will never stop tormenting me. - Tormenting you? You're mean to me for fun. - Are you insane? You're the mean one, Meg Murphy. You've been ruining my life every single day for the past eight years! My last name is Murray. Murray, Murphy-- it's alphabetical. Splorch! Every year, every class, I have been one seat over from you. Everything that happened to you happened to me. Oh! You've made every day of my life a living nightmare. Ah! And the saddest part is that you've always been so full of yourself and your whole, "I'm cursed, so pity me" saga, that you've never even noticed anyone around you. - Could what she was saying be true? Do I just ignore the people around me? - Are you even listening to me? - Hey, Ivy, cut it out! You're the one feeling sorry for yourself. - What? - Yeah, you've been moping around this town all summer. - It's not Meg's fault she's a little accident-prone. - Accident-prone my foot. She's cursed. - Oh, come on. - It's true. I am cursed. All the bad stuff that happens to me, it's... It's never gonna go away, so... That's that. - Come on, who cares what my cousin thinks? I like you. - [Groans] Come on. - Seriously? [Indistinct chatter] - Wait. You and Ivy are related? - That's what cousins means. - So Caitlin O'Leary was... - My great great grandmother? Kind of weird that you know that, by the way. - Hey, Meg, that means you can still break the curse. You just have to give Brett the coin. - This is it, guys. End of the dance. So let's finish up the evening with the traditional harvest hills square dance. [Cheers and applause] - May I? - Oh, just give him the coin. It's the last dance. It's the last dance. - Okay. - Come on, let's dance. [Coin clattering] - Uh-oh. Big problem. - I'm nighthawk. [Upbeat fiddle music] ¶ ¶ [coin clattering] ¶ ¶ [coin clattering] All: Whoo! Whoo! - I need to talk to you in private. - What is it? - Uh... Knock-knock. - Excuse me? - Coming through. - Knock-knock. - Who's there? - Give me that coin. - Give me that coin who? - Thank you. [Magical shimmering] - Okay. Well, thanks. I'll keep it as a memento. - What a fantastic last dance, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. - Nighthawk here. Did you break the curse? - Was it broken? I didn't know. How could I tell? - And now what you've all been waiting for. I'd like to congratulate the lucky winner of our raffle, Meg Murphy! [Cheers and applause] - Meg. Meg, you won. - No, I never win anything. - Meg Murphy, please come up here and claim your prize. - I won. - You won. - I won. - I told you. Ms. 0% chance. - Hey, kid if you play your cards right, maybe your girlfriend here will bring you on her vacation. - Yeah. Maybe my girlfriend will. - Girlfriend? [Cheers and applause] The curse is broken. My life is finally gonna be normal. I can do anything I want. I even, amazingly, unbelievably, stupendously have a boyfriend. Life is perfect. - "By harvest night complete this verse, and the o'learys will receive the curse"? What is this? [Birds chirping] - ¶ It's a brand new day ¶ ¶ and everything is okay ¶ ¶ I don't have the curse ¶ ¶ something that rhymes with curse ¶ all right, this isn't a musical, and I can't sing, but the point is, I'm curse-free. Look out, world. There's so much I can do now. No more hurricane Meg. [Machine beeping] - Okay, Mr. cookie, give me your worst. [Machine beeping] [Gasps] Ding! What the heck? Both: Something's wrong. - The insta cookie's working perfectly. - I fed the baby, and look at me. I'm clean. - If I didn't know any better, I... - Oh, no. Oh, she couldn't. - No. She wouldn't. - [Laughing] No. Meg! Meg? - I have some amazing news, everyone. - Meg, did you break the curse? - Yes! Whoo-hoo! - [Sighs] - Why is no one jumping up and down? - Meg, honey, what were you thinking? - I was thinking I'd get rid of that horrible curse that's been in our family. You know, the one that makes us trip, throws tree branches at us, and makes houses fall down and stuff. Aren't you happy? - Honey, um, who did you give the coin to? - Brett, and it ended the curse. - No, Meg. You didn't end the curse. You transferred it to--to Brett and his family. - And now he's doomed. It all makes sense now. - What are you talking about? - It's the last verse of the rhyme from Tommy's diary. "By harvest night, complete this verse..." All: "And the o'learys shall receive the curse." - This line has been temporarily disconnected. - Never a good sign. This has to be some sort of horrible mistake. Seriously, Brett was fine. I think. I mean, I could never-- I would never transfer the curse to him. I was just trying to get rid of it. [All murmuring] Hey, is there any way I can transfer the curse back to us? - I'm afraid not. The curse can only be broken during the harvest dance. - I don't believe this. I'm gonna kill my boyfriend before I get my first kiss. - I got this, honey. - Uh, yeah, I'll go. - I was hoping you were gonna say that. - Now that I'm normal, I'm supposed to be happy. But instead I'm more miserable than ever. - Honey, I--I don't know why you thought you needed to be normal to be happy in the first place. - Because how can anyone be happy when they're jinxed? - You know, I wasn't born a Murphy. For 20 years, I lived a perfectly normal life. And I will tell you a secret. Since I married your father and I took this curse on, I have never been happier. Oh, sweetie. I told you before, this curse does not determine whether or not your life is good or bad or happy or lonely. You do. - But it's too late. I've already given the curse to Brett. It's over. - No, it's not over. - What? How? - I took a second look at the diary. The curse must be broken by the end of the festival, not the dance. The festival-- back then, the dance was the very last event. - But it isn't anymore. The festival doesn't end until the closing ceremonies. - So that means I can still take the curse back from Brett. - Yeah. - I'm going to his house. - Quick, you only have an hour. Run! - Run! Okay, we've got an hour without the curse. [Gasps] I haven't used a curling iron since I became a Murphy. [Gasps] - One hour with no curse. - Dad... [Panting] [Chainsaw buzzing] Is it cool if I use this to chop down one of your trees? - Sure, son. - Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! No curse! - I can run! Without tripping or-- or hitting tree branches. So this is what normal feels like. No worries, no fear of everyday things like waking up in the morning with a bat in your hair or--or walking or... Wait. If I take the curse back, good-bye running, good-bye science camp, good-bye normal. Taking the curse back means giving up everything I've been hoping for. [Water hissing] [Lawnmower rattling] Whoosh! [Crashing] [Animal sounds] Um... [Knocking on door] Hello? - You. - What are you doing here? - Not that it's any of your business, but my house fell down today. Then I come to my cousin's house, and there's an angry monkey tearing the place apart. Now you show up, and this is officially the worst day ever. - I know. And I'm sorry, but I need to find Brett. - He's at the closing ceremony. Now bye! - Ivy, here's the thing. There's a chance that I maybe might have possibly, accidentally cursed you and your entire family. - You think? - Right, sorry. But I need your help to... How did you get all that gum in your hair? - The angry monkey. I don't want to talk about it. - Right. I have to find Brett to take the curse back before the festival ends, or you and your family will be stuck with it. We need to go. Ivy didn't want to go at first, even though after one day with the curse, she lost her house, she has gum in her hair, and her cousin's house is a wreck. It was the thought of being alone with the monkey that convinced her to help. [Monkey screeching] - Next contestant in the harvest hills skate jam, Charlie Murphy. - Yo, I bet he breaks every bone in his body. How awesome is this gonna be? - Hey, skater fail boy. How do you plan out those gnarly crunches? - Eh, it's a gift. I don't even have to try. [All chanting "fail boy"] - Charlie. What's the matter? - I'm not cursed, so I'm not gonna fail, and then everyone's gonna hate me. - [Chuckles] They're not gonna hate you. Just do your best. - Dad, I'm skater fail boy. - No. You're Charlie Murphy. And cursed or not, you can do anything. If you try. - Thanks, dad. - Go get 'em, son. [All chanting "fail boy"] - [Breathes deeply] [People cheering] [People gasping] - Whoa! [People cheering] Yeah. [Chortles] I did it. - Whoo-hoo! Way to go, Charlie! Yeah! - Yeah, I did it! Yeah! - Whoo! That's my son. Whoo! [Audience slowly clapping] [Cheers and applause] - Yeah, I did it! I did it! Yeah, I did it! [Cheering] - Where is this kid? - Whoa! - I'm sorry I'm late, sir. It's been kind of a crazy day. I had to outrun a bitey raccoon. But I think I lost him. - Um, okay. Let's all give a big hand to Brett Taylor for being chosen as this year's closing ceremony ambassador. [Cheers and applause] Thanks to his tireless community service for our great town. Now, once he climbs up there and lowers the festival flag, another festival of fun will officially end. Okay, son. Climb that tower. [Cheers and applause] [Wood creaking] - Wait. I need a break. Ah! - Ivy. - [Whimpers] - Are you okay? - [Grunts] [Panting] This whole time I thought you were doing these awful things to me on purpose. I thought you were out to get me. You weren't, were you? [Sighs] I've been unfair to you. You really were cursed. - It's okay. I should have been nicer as well. I mean, I never really realized how much my hurricane can get other people caught in it. If it makes you feel any better, I've fallen in enough mud puddles to know it does wonders for your skin. - [Chortles] - Now, come on. Let's go find Brett. [Bee buzzing] - Really? Go. Whoa! [Grunts] [Panting] - I don't see him. - [Grunting] - There he is! - [Grunting] - All right, go get him, Meg. All: Climb over three feet, you're dead meat. - Listen to us, dummy! - Meg? Do you want me to climb up there instead? - No, just stay right there and don't look up until I take the curse back from Brett, or a meteor might fall from the sky or something if you do. Okay. Not this time, ladder. Not this time. I won't let my fear of-- - are you gonna go already? - Right. Okay. - [Grunting] - This was it. My last chance to back out and have my life be normal. But then I realized something. I don't want to be normal. I want to be me, hurricane Meg, a Murphy. And cursed or not, if I can climb a ladder, I can do anything. [Whimpering] Stop! don't lower the flag! - Meg? - You're the first good thing I've seen all day. It's been kind of crazy. - I know, and it's all my fault. I gave you a curse. - What? - You see, my family was cursed with bad luck by a witch, and then I sort of gave it to you. I'm sorry. - What--so this happens to you every day? - On a good day, yeah. That coin I gave you last night, do you still have it? - Uh, yeah, I kept it, I thought for good luck. - Great. I can take the curse back. All you have to do is give it to me. - No. - No? What do you mean, no? - Well, I don't want you to suffer from bad luck either. - No, no, no, it's not like that. I don't mind the curse. I mean, not anymore. I haven't really minded it since I met you, actually. You make things... Well, you make them okay. Better than okay-- happy. And we all have stuff to deal with. It's all about how you approach it. So? Give me the coin. - Give her the coin, idiot! - Okay. [Lightning crashes] [Electrical zapping] - [Moaning] - Whoa. - Ah! [People gasping] Help me. Please grab my hand. Grab my hand. Please pull me up. [Woman screams] [Gasps] [Cheers and applause] Thanks. - No problem. - Now that everything was back to normal, dad discovered the cookies from insta cookie turned your teeth blue. - Holy smokes, my teeth are blue. I got you, insta cookie. [Laughs] We're gonna be rich. [Laughs] - So he turned his report in after all. To celebrate, we decided to take the trip that I won at the raffle. The Murphys, the grand canyon? What could go wrong there? Charlie's big win at the skating competition made him realize he doesn't need the curse to be awesome. [Glass shattering] Best of all, I realized that my mom was right. It didn't matter if I was cursed. I could be anything I wanted. That's right. I went to science camp. I will now add hydrogen chloride. - No, no! No, no, no, wait! That's not hydrogen... [Coughing] [Students gasping] What? - Then I realized my bad luck could sometimes do good things. You're welcome, bald people everywhere, and I found out my great great grandpa learned the same thing. - If I'd never had the curse, then I'd never have been at the hospital, and I'd never have met my edna. She makes me happier than anything. And I don't need this coin anymore. 'Cause I'm the luckiest guy in town. Splash! [Water rushing] [Water splashing] - Meg, time to go! - Grandpa. - Oh, hi, honey. - I'd give you a hug, but... - Oh, I know. It's like hugging a pregnant orange. I still got some kinks to work out. - And I know you will. Even though this isn't the summer that I imagined, in some ways it was better. - Bye. - Bye. don't get me wrong. I'm happy we're leaving harvest hills to go to the grand canyon, but I'm going to miss my new best friend. - Meg. - You heard me right. I have a best friend. She truly gets me, curse and all. What are you guys doing here? - We had to come and say good-bye and remind you about rule 34. Careful on road trips. - And you be careful of angry monkeys. I'll see you in school. - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. [Trunk slams] - Standing right here. Okay. - [Chortles] See you when you get back, okay? Call me when you get there, all right? - Okay. See you guys later. You know, I think we all feel like we're cursed at times. - What? - Move over, little brother. The question is, are you gonna let it define who you are. - Hey, dad, we're going to the grand canyon, right? - Yep. - But isn't Murphy rule number 82 to stay away from canyons? - I think it's time we bent the rules just a little. [Bungee cord snaps] [Electrical zapping] Both: Uh-oh. - Uh-oh. Zap! - Whoo!
