Help your dad. - You're both old enough. - I have anxiety. - Anxiety! Anxiety at ten? Get outta here with that. - Come in, my love, come in. - I made some food that you're going to love. - Grandma, your picadillo the best. - Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. - I'm glad these kids came out intelligent. - Like their Grandmother. - Enjoy it because this is real food. Not that stuff you guys eat of hotdogs and hamburgers. - Just ignore her. We're only here for a few weeks. - Mm. Mom, the food is delicious. - You want more? There's more. - No. No, I'm full. - Okay, good. Don't eat anymore, that way you won't get fat. - Don't worry, we're only gonna be here for a few weeks. Remember? - So Mom, how have you been? - How do you expect me to be, son? I don't know. - After your father's death, I feel so alone. - I miss abuelo. - I miss him too. - But anyway, now I have you guys here with me... - ...and I'm sure we're going to have an amazing weekend. - We're going to have so much fun. - Jorge? - Oh. - You know how we're gonna be here this weekend? Well, we're actually gonna be here this weekend and every other weekend. - Nelsito, wait a moment. - Can you explain, my love? What do you mean? - Juana, we are moving to Miami. - What? - No? - After Dad passed away, we knew you couldn't be alone. - And we knew you weren't going to move to California with us and this house mean a lot to you. - Yes, but what about your jobs? And school for the Kids? - Everything has been taken care of. We both found jobs, and Jorge and Nora start school tomorrow. - Now you have us forever, Grandma. - How wonderful! Thank you our lady of charity. - Thank you, thank you for this beautiful gift. - And we also bought a house near here. - Really? - Yes. It's abandoned so it needs a little bit of work. but if it's okay if we can stay here for a couple of weeks while we fix it up? - Of course. - You're more than welcome to stay here as long as you need. - This is your home. - So tell me, where's the house? - It's a couple of blocks away from here. The Bradford house? No! No! No! You're crazy! - Why, Mom? - What do you mean, "why?!" - You guys can't live there. - That house is haunted, it has demons! - What is she talking about? - What do you mean, "what am I talking about?" - Everybody knows about it. Everybody. It's haunted. You bought a haunted house? - You bought a haunted house? - Jorge, put the phone down. Listen, she doesn't know what she's talking about. - What do you mean "I don't know what I'm talking about?!" of course I know! - Listen to me. Listen to me. That house has been abandoned for many, many years. You know why? Because every time somebody wants to live there, they run right out, because it's full of demons, haunted. It's haunted. Haunted! Haunted house. - Dad, I want to go back to California. - Mom, you're scaring her. - No. - Gosh, it's okay. There's no demons there. - Did the realtor mention any of this to you? - Mm. - How do you mention a four-bedroom, two-bathroom house with a double car garage, a big backyard, and maybe ghosts? - Listen, I don't believe in any of that, okay? Have you seen a ghost? Have you seen a ghost? No. Exactly, thank you. - I've never seen a ghost, and you want to know why? Because I've never lived in a haunted house. - Well enough, we already bought the house. - And mom, I bought it because it was the only one we could afford. - And to be close to you. - Babe, I'm sorry. I know you're really stressed out, and you don't any of this right now. - Forgive me, my love. - I know everything you do, you do it thinking of others. - Now, let's finish our food, let's unpack. Tomorrow you guys have class. We'll go by the house in the morning, start work. - Excuse me. Santo? Santo, it's me Juana Rodriguez. Yes. I need you to pick me up tomorrow at 7:00 a.m. - At seven in the morning, Santo. Yes. We have to do a spiritual cleansing. Okay. Hello? Hello. Hello Hello, hello, hello. Hello. Oh. Santo. Santo come in. Come on. - Come in. - So this is the famous Bradford house? Yes it is. - And unfortunately, my son decided to buy it. - What, what, what happened? - Santo what was that? - There are bad spirits in this house. - We have to start. - Santo, what are you doing? - Is this a cleansing or a bakery? - I'm starving, lady, I haven't had breakfast. - You can have breakfast after. - We have to finish before my son gets here. - Please. - Okay. - C'mon. - Oh yes. - What is going on here? - I think that guy's a chef. - Wait, wait, wait, I know exactly what they're doing. It's called a despojo. - A what? - Some spiritual cleansing of bad spirits. - There's bad spirits in this house? Where? Oh. - Juana. Juana. You stand here. - Oh, it's about to start. - Is this diet? - Santo, why do you have to put me in this circle? - Because you are the connection Between your family and this house. Okay. - Santo please. - Santo please. - Santo please. - So, this is supposed to get rid of us? 'Cause I could sit here all day and watch the old lady suffer. - Quiet. Now it's where it gets good. - It gets better than this? - Yeah. - What are you going to do with these eggs? - Shh. - Okay. - I think it's time for us to start a show of our own. - I don't know because this is a tough act to follow. - See, this is why we're never gonna be in show business. You have zero confidence in us. - Ah, Santo, what is that? - What? - What happened to that light? - What? - Oh, Santo. - No, it wasn't me! It was you! - It was you. - No, it was you! - It wasn't me. - I'm scared! - I'm scared too! - Juana! Juana! - Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Hey, thanks for the show. It was eggcellent! - Yeah, you guys crack me up. Make sure to get some rest. You must be eggshausted. - Hey, why are you guys eggnoring us? - I guess they don't like our yolks. - Wow, that entire exchange of egg puns is really bad. - Yeah, it eggscalated quickly. What? That was good. - We're actually gonna be here this weekend and every other weekend. - And school for the kids? - I know what I'm talking about, of course I know. - Haunted! Haunted! - Looks like we got some more company. - Again? What's going on this week? Come on. - Get off me. - It's awesome right? Look at the size of this yard. Come on, imagine the landscaping right there. A fountain right over there on the left. - No, you're not putting a fountain in the front yard. - Well, at least he's cute. - I don't think he's really your type. - Oh, yeah, and what's his type? - I don't know, alive? - What are you doing? - Got to get some ghosts on camera. - You're gonna catch a fist on camera if you don't stop. - What's wrong, Ma, you scared? Jorge Antonio Rodriguez, don't push my buttons. - Dad, Jorge broke the mailbox! - Shut up, Nora. - I was gonna replace it anyways. Come on, let's check it out. What happened here? - This is disgusting. - It's probably some kids. - Or a ghost. - These were not kids. These were Santeros. - What are Santeros? - People who believe in Santa Claus. - Well, then I'm a Santero, and my people should never do this. - Don't believe your brother, Nora. - C'mon, let me show you the kitchen. - Come on, this is great. - Oh, sick. There's nothing there. There's nothing there. Scared the crap out of me, man! - Looks like you found your bedroom. If you need to change your pants, the bathroom's over there. - Yeah, yeah, everybody's got jokes. - I like this family. They're fun. - Yeah, a blast. - What's wrong with you? - Honestly, I'm just tired of having to scare families away every time a new one comes around. - Well, maybe these are the ones. - No one will ever be the ones, Christy. No one deserves to live here. - Hey, is it cool if I walked to Abuela's after school? It's not even too far from here. - Okay. But go directly to your Grandmother's house. - Okay, okay. - And be sure to make some friends! - Okay, Dad. - Yeah, loser! - Don't put your hand-- - He needs friends. - Settle down, take your seats! Take your seats! What is this?! What are you, why is this appropriate to you?! Sit down, you hooligans. Don't any of you have mothers? You're late! Down now. Go, go, go, go. Shut up! Thank you. Now that you guys look like you're in the mode to learn, I have several announcements that will pre-date that. The first announcement, we have a brand new student. Jorge Rodriguez, would you please stand up? Introduce yourself to the class and talk about what you'd like to accomplish here. - Um, hey, guys. My name is Jorge Rodriguez. I moved here from California to Miami, to take care of my grandma, and we just bought a house not too far from here. We're trying to fix it up 'cause it's been abandoned for some time. I look forward to making new friends, joining some clubs, and having a good time. - Yeah, friends and clubs, that's cool. What else do you want to do? Like, in an educational environment. - I don't know yet-- - I don't know, what are some things that children do in a classroom, Mr. Rodriguez? Maybe words that start with an L? Oh, oh, learn? - Learning, yes, of course. - Of course, learning, great. Okay, why don't you sit down? - Okay. - Now, everybody, get into your computers, put the code into your browser, and we're gonna start with basic concepts of JavaScript. - Hey, yo, Jorge. Yo, Jorge, what's Gucci? - What's Gucci? - Yeah, man. - The clothing brand? - No, that's like saying what's good, you know, what's up? - Oh. Right. - My name's Guillermo, but they call me Guille, with my crew, Mark and Rob. - What's up? - Nice meeting you guys. - You know, we heard you talk about that abandoned house. By any chance that's the Bradford house? - Yeah, actually, it is. - Oh, man, that's crazy. - You do know about that house, right? - What, that it's haunted? Yeah. - Well, have you, you know, seen anything? - Yeah, like, apparitions maybe? - Like, ghosts? Nah, man. - Oh, okay, cool. - Look, well, you know, Halloween's coming up in a couple of days, I think it'd be pretty cool if you were to throw a Halloween party there. - I don't know about that. I mean, like, the whole place is a wreck. There's spiderwebs everywhere. It's not even done being painted, you know? - Well, that's even better, it's authentic. - Duh. - No need for decorations. - Exactly. - Yeah, but my parents would never even allow that to happen. - Wow, your parents. - Well, who says they need to know? Look, man, you're new here, right? What's the best way to make friends? Throw the biggest Halloween party ever. Ever. What better place to throw a Halloween party than a haunted house? - I don't know, man. - Look, man, one of the things you said you were looking forward to having was fun, right? Halloween party equals F-U-N, fun. Well, think about it. - Think about it. - Jenny, I told you I never wanted to come back here again. - You think I'm not going to do anything after what happened last night. - You're crazy. - No, you're crazy. - Don't call me crazy, Carlos. - Babe. - Look. - Here they come. - Hi, I'm Jenny, the one that called you guys. - Carlos. - Max. - Willy. - Okay, well, this is the place here. We live a few houses down, and we don't want the ghosts terrorizing our neighborhood, so. - Yeah, there's a lot of crazy, wicked stuff going on inside, guys, so, you know, just try to be careful, okay? - I don't know how to do that. - Do what? - Be careful. - Okay, well, um, oh. - Check it out. - Okay, well, um, well, we're gonna go. If you need anything, just-- - Let's go. - Or you can just ignore me. That's fine too, I don't care! I don't care, did they just ignore me? You can't ignore me! - Don't ignore me! - Don't touch me! - Willy! Today! - What in God's name is that? - What is it? - Huh. Check out their car. - Miami Paranormal Hunters. We don't bust 'em, we hunt 'em. They're gonna hunt us? Cool! - I know, right? - You're gonna invite us in, and not even have the decency to come out and say hello? - "Welcome." - Very, very rude. - Ahem. Now we can do this the hard way, or we can do this the Max way. Either way, you're screwed. You see this here? This is the EGZ 3000, the Electro Ghost Zapper, designed by yours truly. - Nicely done, sir. - Thank you very much, Willy. Now I don't want to have to use the EGZ 3000, well, actually, I do 'cause I can go for some ghost toast and butter right about now. But I won't, if you come on out and play nice. Did you hear that? - Yes, sir. Maybe we should go investigate? - Uh. Okay. - Okay. - Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea, Willy. Do you want to maybe get like, a bite to eat before we go upstairs, or... - Well, yes, I'm kind of hungry. - Okay, good, so-- - But maybe we should go investigate. - Yeah, no, no, you're right 'cause that's what we do, we're-- - Investigators! - Right, right. We investigate. - It's only gerbil. - Nice job, ghost, huh? The old noise by a rodent routine. Classic ghost strategy. - They can't fool us. - It's in my pants! Oh, it's in my pants! It's in my pants! Willy, it's in my pants! Get it off! Get it off! Get it, get it! Get it off me! Get it off! Get it off, Willy! Get it off! - Hey, hey, hey! - What's going on here?! - Get out of here, kid! We're working! - Yeah, we're busy! Scram! - I'm not getting out of here! You guys need to get out of here! This is my house! - Oh, this is your house? Welcome home. - I hate those guys! They're such jerks! - I know. First, they almost killed Gary, and now they're keeping that kid hostage. - Okay, we have to help him. - I got an idea. The hunters are about to become the haunted. - Okay, I see what you did there. It was good. - I gave you a chance, kid. I told you to leave, twice. Two times. But you had to be a stubborn little brat, now didn't you? A little brat. Willy, I got this. Now I need you to be a good little boy. And let the big boys finish their job. What in the hell?! - Welcome to the jungle. - Hunting season's open, baby! - Get out of here! Let's get out of here! - We were just starting to have fun! - It's a shame, I had the perfect place on the wall to mount their heads. - Of course. Are you okay? Relax. Just here to help. Those were the bad guys, not us. - It's like my grandmother used to say, "Got to be afraid of the living than the dead." - Promise not to scream, and I'll give you your voice back. Deal? - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm Christy. That's my brother Chris. - I'm Jorge. - Yeah, we know, we saw you with your family this morning. - I knew I saw something! - Yeah, that was Christy not doing a very good of being a ghost. - I thought she did a pretty good job of the whole ghost thing. - Thank you. - Oh, dear God. - So, are you guys gonna be staying here when we move in? - Well, are you planning on kicking us out of our house? - No. Okay, I didn't mean that. Of course you guys can stay here, just can't scare anyone. - We kinda already did! - Yeah, your grandmother came by this morning. - You scared my grandma? She's like, a hundred! - In our defense, she did try to get us to leave with some Santeria kind of things, so. What? - Oh, I wish I could've seen it. - It was good. - Good, yeah. - Yeah. - So, what brings you to the neighborhood? - Uh, we moved here from California because my grandfather passed away not too long ago. And so, you know, my dad wanted to be closer to my grandmother. - Oh, I'm so sorry about the eggs. - Oh, no, don't worry, it's fine, really. I mean, she deserved it. But how about you guys? If, you know, you don't mind me asking. - We actually do mind you asking. - Chris. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. It'll be 10 years this Halloween since the incident happened. - You really don't have to tell me anything at all. - It's fine. We were driving to a Halloween party-- - I was driving. - Chris was driving us to a Halloween party, and it was raining out. A cat ran in front of us, and since the roads were wet, we went into a canal. We weren't able to get out. - Yeah, so basically, we're here 'cause of me. - I try and tell him all the time, it wasn't his fault, but... - Look, I'm so sorry. I didn't-- - It's okay. - I've really got to head out. - Hey, can you do me a favor? - Sure. - Please don't tell your parents about us. I mean, they seem like good people, so I don't want them to be scared moving into a haunted house. - Yeah. Okay. - Um, hey. When will you be back next? - Probably tomorrow. - Okay, cool, I guess I'll see you then. - Okay. Cool, I'll see you then. - Nelson, you guys can't live in that house. - Mom, we spoke about this yesterday. - Yes, I know we spoke about it yesterday but today is today and yesterday was yesterday. - And today I change my mind. - But what happened Juana? There has to be a reason. - Yes, I know, but promise me you won't get mad at me. Okay? - Well, early this morning I went to the house with my friend, Santo. - The santero? - Yes. - Grandma, you saw Santa Claus? - Oh stop it, child. - Nora, please. It's an adult conversation. Keep these on. - Juana, Please don't tell me it was you that made that mess. - Mm-mm. The eggs? I spent 2 hours cleaning those eggs! - It wasn't me! - It wasn't me! - The ghosts threw those eggs! - Jesus Christ, Mom! - Yes, jesus Christ, we need him here right now! - Grandma, you saw Jesus Christ? - Oh, child. - Nora, adult conversation. Come on. You know this already. - Juana, I'm sorry, but you're crazy. - I might be old, and not that old. - But I'm definitely not crazy. - How's it going? What's up? - Abuela saw Santa Claus and Jesus Christ. - Nora, just go to your room, please. - I am in my room. I sleep on the sofa. - Apparently, your grandmother went to the house and ghosts threw eggs at her. - It's okay, laugh at me, it doesn't matter. - I just went to the house and I didn't see a thing. - You went to the house? - Yeah, I stopped by on the way here. - How'd you get in? - The door was unlocked. - I locked the door. - I'm glad! I'm glad! You see? It was the ghosts! - Grandma, please. - Mom, please. - Fine! I'll shut up! I won't say another word! - I shot my mouse! - Why did Abuela shoot her mouse? - I didn't even know she had a mouse. - Why is she making this so difficult to us? - Babe, she's getting old. - Yeah, Dad, she's like, hundred years old or something. - You guys, she's been through a lot. - Right, like, you know, communist and stuff. - What? - What are you talking about? - I don't know, look, what I'm trying to say is that you can't believe everything she says. Okay? - Babe, you have to be patient with your mom, especially now. - She's got a lot on her mind. - I have an idea. Why don't you two go to the store and that way we can start painting tomorrow? - Yeah. Let's do it. - Yeah, sure. - I love you. - I love you too. - Hello? Can you guys not do that in my room? It's no kiss zone. - Oh, really?! - Okay. - Ah. Mwah, mwah. Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah. - Are you playing cards? Are you playing cards? You playing cards? Yeah, oh, oh, did you need that one? Did you need that one? - I'm gonna go play. - Or you can try helping us. - According to Dad, I'm a princess, and princesses don't help, so no. - Mom, is that necessary? - Of course it is! - You're lucky I haven't called the pope yet. - Nelson, let her be. Oh! - So we met Nora. - Yeah, I see. What, you guys couldn't disappear or something? - We thought we could, but she could still see us, so. - I see dead people. - Hey, me too. - That was funny. - All right, all right, all right. Nora, you need to listen to me. You can't tell Mom or Dad or Grandma or anyone about this. You got to keep this our little secret, okay? - Give me your room. - What? - Give me your room! - My bedroom? - Yes. - That's my bedroom, I can't. I don't want to give you that. It's bigger. - Okay. Mom! - No! - Nope. - Okay, fine. You can have it. - Well, thank you, Brother. You're so kind and generous! - Can you get outta here? I need to talk to them. - Anything for the brother of the year. If you need me, I'll be in my new room. - Ouch, you just got hustled by a little girl. - Shut up, Chris. I used to hustle you all the time. - No, no-- - Mm-hm, yeah. Remember when I saw you break Mom's favorite vase, and I got your entire candy stash? - That was some really-- - Okay, I need to ask you guys a question. - Yeah, um, but before you do, um, I just wanted to say something. I just wanted to apologize for my behavior. Lately, I've been frustrated about some certain things and just shouldn't have taken it out on you, so, uh, I'm sorry. - It's okay. No worries. - Cool, cool. We cool. Cool. Are we good? Yeah? - Yeah. - Awesome. - Oh, so, what did you want to ask us? - Right. So, um, since I'm new in town, I don't really have much, any friends, so I was thinking since Halloween's coming up, if it would be a fun idea to throw a Halloween party here? - No! - Yes! Why? - Are you kidding me? He's gonna trash the house! - More than it already is? - Oh, no. - Okay, okay, listen to me. Listen to me. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no-- - This is my house as much as it is yours. I'm not gonna let anything happen. - No, no. - Nothing's gonna happen. - Plus, it'll make up for the Halloween party that we missed. Please? - Under one condition. - You name it. - Just keep it small? - Done. - Yes! I'm so excited! Sorry. Um. Did I do that? - Yeah, that was awkward for everybody. - Jorge! - Coming! I got to go. If you're not doing anything tomorrow, maybe I could take you out and could look at the town, you know, since you're new and kind of friendless. - Um, yeah. - Cool. - Are you guys having a staring contest or something? 'Cause it kinda looked like it a little bit. - No, uh-- - No? No, um. - Yeah. - No? - No, no staring contest. - Oh, okay. Just curious. - No. - No, no? - Just talking. - Oh, okay, well-- - Jorge.

Max, wake up. - Hey, wake up! - What happened?! The kid's back. - That little punk. - Him and those stupid ghosts think they can humiliate us and get away with it? - They don't know what's in store for them. Willy, what are you doing? - Shh. Scoping out the house. - Oh, yeah? Is the house in space? - Well, technically, the house is on Earth, the Earth is in the Solar System in space, so yeah. - Get this thing out of my face. - What's the magic word-- - Now! - Not as magical as please, but okay. - We need to find a way to get into that house and expose those ghosts. - And how we going to do that? - Simple. How do people get famous nowadays? - Hotdog eating contest. - Great idea! - What? No, Willy, that is not a good idea. A hotdog eating contest? That's not even the top 25 ways of getting famous! I'm talking viral videos, man. Viral videos. We go into the house, prove to the world that ghosts do exist by getting footage of us capturing said ghosts, and then we become the most famous paranormal hunters ever. - Yes! And then we get our own TV show, and then the movies, and then comic books, and, oh, action figures. I always wanted my own action figure. I would play with myself all day long. - Hello? Hello? You guys scared the crap out of me. - Sorry, we're kind of used to doing that. - What, giving people heart attacks? - I mean, I guess. - Oh, it's actually only happened twice. - I mean, you would think. - So where did my parents go? You didn't scare them, did you? - No. - Oh, no, no. They left like, 30 minutes ago. They said something about taking your grandma home, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah, yeah. - So, you ready? - Yeah, let's go. - Oh yeah. - Yeah. Oh, no, no, you guys have fun, yeah. - I mean, the Uber's outside waiting. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, cool. - Yeah, we once tried taking an Uber, it didn't really work out. Just went past us. - Stay safe! - Who the heck is he talking to? - Maybe he has one of those Bluetooth headsets. - No. No, no, that's not a Bluetooth he's talking into. ♪ Every little movement ♪ ♪ Every little thing you do ♪ ♪ Is it sleight of hand that commands my heart to love you ♪ ♪ Every little movement ♪ ♪ Every motion of your hips ♪ ♪ I feel the compulsion to pull you to my sweet lips ♪ ♪ See the black magic spell you put me under ♪ ♪ This miracle moment ♪ ♪ Never let it end ♪ ♪ Every little movement ♪ ♪ Is beyond improvement ♪ ♪ You are the magician I've been wishing for forever ♪ ♪ Every little movement ♪ ♪ Is beyond improvement ♪ ♪ You are the magician I've been wishing for forever ♪ ♪ Every little gesture ♪ ♪ Is a mystical caress ♪ ♪ And all of my fears disappear into this madness ♪ ♪ You could hypnotize me ♪ ♪ You could put me in a trance ♪ ♪ Or cut me in half laughing at my foolish romance ♪ ♪ See the black magic spell you put me under ♪ ♪ This miracle moment ♪ ♪ Never let it end ♪ ♪ Every little movement ♪ ♪ Is beyond improvement ♪ ♪ You are the magician I've been wishing for forever ♪ ♪ You could bind me in blindfolds ♪ ♪ You could put my heart in chains ♪ ♪ You could make the world vanish ♪ ♪ But my Spanish love remains ♪ - Thanks for showing me around town. You know, I had a really nice time. - Me too. We got a lot done in such a little time. - Yeah, more than I would ever imagined. - Yeah, seems almost impossible to do everything that we did. - Right? Kinda felt like '80s movies montage. - Yeah. Weird. So we should probably end this like most '80s movie montages end, right? - How's that? - Like this. - Hi, Jorge. - What's wrong with your lips? - Yeah, my lips hurt. - It's probably herpes. - Shut up, Nora. - Put some Vicks VapoRub on it, that cures everything. - Yeah, no, don't do that. Where have you been? - I was hanging out with a friend. - Ooh, a friend, a new friend. - How nice! He's already got a friend. - That's awesome, Jorge. That's awesome. - I feel like you guys shouldn't be that excited about that. I've had friends before. - Define friend. - Hey, you guys look exhausted. I mean, you did a lot today. - Yeah, we've just been hanging out, standing around here. - Right. Should probably take the day off tomorrow. - Nah, we got to finish up, you know that. - I mean, come on, you've been painting all day. It looks great. You deserve to take a break. I don't know, maybe a little spa day action, right, Ma? - Ah. He said the magic word. Spa! - See what you did? - Ooh, you guys could do couples massage. - More magical words. Couples massage. Come on, we deserve it. - Yes, my love, don't be silly Go spend the day with your little wife. - Mom, you always have the perfect words to say. - Fine, fine. We'll do a spa day. - Yes! - But you promise we'll finish up tomorrow. - Yes, sir. - All right, now come on, come in. Come in, everybody. Come on. Come on. Come on. You feel that? - Um, Grandma's heavy breathing on my face? - No, no, no. This house is peaceful. - Looks like it's almost time. - So these friends of yours replaced good with Gucci and lit? - Yeah. - Why don't they just say good? - That's what I'm saying. - I just got finished with the backyard. - Oh, cool, thanks. - Yeah, no problem. Uh, did you two have fun last night? - Nora, what are you doing here? - Mom and Dad are at the spa, and Grandma fell asleep watching soap operas. And I was bored, so I decided to go trick or treating, and came back here. - Hey, Nora, you're 10 years old. You can't just go trick or treating by yourself. - Okay, cool, so at what time's the party? - It doesn't matter what time the party is, you're not coming to the party. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am! - No, you're not! - Jorge, do you see this? I'm a princess, which means I do what I want. - I don't care if you're the queen, you're not coming to this party. What are you doing? - I'm calling Dad to let him know you're not letting his princess come to your party. - Oh, no. No, no. Okay, okay, fine! You can come to the party, but you do not tell Mom or Dad a word about this. Not a word. - Wow, Jorge, you just got hustled by a little girl again. Nice job, princess. - Nice job, princess. - What was that? - Nothing. I'm gonna go finish decorating. - Can I come with you? Please? - Well, well, well, looks like someone's having a little Halloween party. - That's awesome! - What are you gonna dress up as? I think I'm gonna dress up as the poop emoji. Those things are hilarious because they're literally poop. - We're not dressing up like anything, Willy. You don't see what this is? - The perfect opportunity. - Yes, I know... - To dress up like the poop emoji. - No, you moron. The perfect opportunity to expose these ghosts. - Tonight we enter that house. And we capture those ghosts in front of the entire world. It's gonna be a very happy Halloween. What is this? - It's a gift. - No, I see it's a gift, Willy, but why would you give me a gift halfway through my villainous laugh? - I thought you were done. - Oh, clearly, I wasn't! - Open it. I made them last night. What do you think? You're speechless. I knew you would love them. It's okay. Those two were yours. I made copies. Ooh, pow, pow, pow. Ping. - Jeez, Jorge, you've been taking forever. Are you almost done? - Yeah, I'm almost done, all right? It takes a long time to put makeup on. - By the time that you're finished, the party's gonna be over. - Shh! Hey, would you keep your mouth shut? Okay? - Hola. - Hey, guys. - Mom, Dad. - Jorge, what is wrong with you? You've been acting so weird lately. - Lately? He's always been weird. - I'm just a little stressed about school and stuff, no big deal. But how about you guys? How as the spa? - Oh, it was great. - We're going to sleep like little angels tonight. - Look good, Jorge. - Thanks, thanks. - My princess, like a little princess. - See, Jorge? Princess! - Let's go. What are you guys doing tonight? We are going trick or treating. - Great, you can take Grandma. - No! I mean, no, because it's super late and she's probably really tired. You know, old people. Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on, come on. - Hello! - Oh, I'm wonder Grandma - Kids! - Kids! Where are you? - Don't leave me! Where are you? Jorge! Jorge! - Kids, where are you going? What's the rush? - Grandma, we're not going trick or treating. - No, no, wait, what do you mean we're not? - Where are we going then? Just tell me. Tell me. - What's wrong? We're going to a party. - Where are you going? - You want to go to a party? At the house. - What house? Where's the party? Our new house. - Your house? You're crazy! I'm gonna tell your father right now! Please, listen to me, okay?! - No, no, no, no, no. - I can't get in trouble with your parents. - Would you just listen to me?! - You be very careful! Very careful! - Don't you scream at your Grandmother! - Okay. Okay. - I'm sorry, Grandma, I'm sorry. - Sorry, sorry, sorry. - I just want you to listen to me for a second. I have no friends, none, so I wanted to throw a little Halloween party, so I can meet a couple people. Please, just don't tell Mom or Dad. - Well, eh, you want to go to the party too? - You want to go to the party too? You going to go? Okay. Your dad is going to kill me, but who cares?! Let's go! - Yes! - Let's go! - Thank you! - You're the best, Grandma! - I'm the best Grandma! - I'm the best Grandma! The craziest too! Oh! Let's go! - Yo, this party is lit. - Whoa, hey, check out the walkers. - Hello, ladies. Happy Halloween, welcome to the party. Would you like some of my meat? - No thanks, we're vegetarians. - Oh, really? Me too! That's why I'm dressed like a carrot. You know, rabbits like carrots. Let me know when you want some. - Yeah, we'd rather starve. - Well, then you're not a real rabbit, then, liar! - Whoa, whoa, Mark, Mark. - I didn't know loser was a costume. - I'm a ghost. - Yo, yo, yo, it's DJ Guayaba! I can't hear you! No, for real, I can't hear you. I have these cotton balls in my ears. I have a bad ear infection. But you guys seem like you're having a good time. Let's get the party back! - Let's do it! - What's up? - Hi. - Great party, huh? - Yup. - What are you supposed to be? - A ghost. - No. This is a ghost. Ooh! - No, this is a ghost. Yeah, that doesn't work for everybody. - Oh, my god. Please don't lean on the wall, okay? Don't spill. Oh. All right, let's keep this nicely attached. All right, oh, my. Well, it's a good thing we told Jorge to keep it small, right? - I know. Have you seen him? - No, I'll go check to see if he's in the back. - Hi. - Hey. - So I see you brought your Grandma with you. - Don't even ask. - So what's this get-up you got going on? - You like it? I'm a ghost pirate. - Ghost pirate. - Oh, yeah. - Well, as an actual ghost, I'm highly offended. It's not what we look like. - What? I thought you'd like it. - Didn't expect this from you. - Are you kidding me? - You're so gullible. - No, no. - I don't dance. I don't dance. I don't dance. - Come on, Grandma, dance! - No, I don't dance ever since Celia Cruz died. Go! - I can't believe this. I can't believe this. - Yo, yo, yo, make noise for Wonder Grandma! I can't hear you! - Whoa, whoa, excuse me! What do you think you're doing? - Just making the punch a little better. - I think the punch is fine just the way it is. - Well, that's your opinion. - Well, I wouldn't do that if I were you. - Yeah? What are you gonna do about it? There's a ghost in the house! - Dude, it's Halloween! There's ghosts everywhere! - Ghost in the house! - Not for long. - Hi, what's up? Yeah, go ahead. Hey, you got 10 bucks, dude?

What the hell are you guys doing here?! - Where are they? - Who? - Don't play stupid. - You know exactly who I'm talking about. - I'm not telling you anything. You guys need to get the hell outta here! - Uh-oh. Ouch. - Leave my brother alone! - Nora, Nora! - What are you doing? - No. No. - Back up, Grandma. - DJ, stop the music. Now! Everybody back up! Back up! And now that I got everybody's attention, first of all, Happy Halloween, kids! - Yeah, Happy Halloween! - My name is Max. That's my little buddy over there, Willy. Say hi to the kids, Willy. - Hi, everybody! - Now, as I'm sure a lot of you know, this isn't just any house. No, no, no, no, no, this is the famous Bradford house, and this house has something that we want. Ghosts. - Ghosts! Two of them to be exact. - Two. - And this kid right here is in love with one of them. - That's right. I saw you and your little girlfriend on your little stupid, pathetic date. Pathetic. So unless you want your little boyfriend to join you on the other side, I suggest you come on out! - Don't do it, Christy! You stay back! - Christy? Ah, well, isn't that cute, huh? Come on out, Christy! Oh. Welcome to the party. - We did what you want, now let him go. - You see, it's not the way it's gonna work. You don't call the shots around here, I do. So this is what's gonna happen: You two are gonna prove to everybody at this party that you're ghosts. So I want everybody to take your cellphones out, start recording, take pictures, stream it online, do whatever you got to do, but just do it! - Everybody! - And soon, the world will finally believe that ghosts do exist, and we will be the most famous paranormal hunters ever! - Gonna have our own action figures. - No way! - Oh, that is so cool. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - We have breaking news coming to you live now from the southwest Miami area where two men appear to be holding people hostage at a Halloween party. - Oh no, look. Carlos look. Look! - Oh, my god. - Look. - What happened, Jenny? - No. Call the police. Call the police, babe! - Look! It's Jorge! - This whole ordeal has been streaming live across multiple social media platforms. - Is that our house?! - Catalina Sanchez is at the scene now with a live report. Catalina? We are live from the famous Bradford House. - Where a Halloween party has turned into a nightmare. - As you can see behind me, the situation is quite serious. - I am really losing my patience with you two! Prove to everyone that ghosts exist now! - Don't do it. - Shut up! - Okay. Okay. We can do that. - Hit it, DJ! - Do you two think you can humiliate us again and get away with it? - This ends here! It's haunting time! - No! - Jorge! - Those are the guys threatening all of these kids! - Put the weapon down! - I'm not going anywhere until I get what I came for! - I said put the weapon down! - We don't bust 'em, we hunt-- - Ooh! - Now you got busted and hunted! Hey-oh! - 10-4, at about how long prior to making this call did it actually occur? - Oh, Max, are we famous yet? - Shut up, Willy! - Mom, Dad! - Nora, what happened?! - Those were the bad guys, those are ghosts, and Jorge is dead. - What? - Oh, my god. I'm so sorry-- - Look. - Are you okay? - Jorge! - Come on, wake up. - Jorge! - Wake up, man. - Jorge! - Jorge! - Am I dead? - No. - Finally! Thank God! - Finally. - Now come on, let's get a hug. - Grandma. - I need help. - So, I think it's time for Christy and I to go. - Go? What do you mean go? - Jorge, this isn't our home anymore. - Of course this is your home. This is your home, and this is our home. - She's not talking about the actual house, Nora. She means here, on Earth. - Are you guys going to space? - Something like that. - We've only been here this long 'cause we couldn't find the right people to live in our home. Now we have. - Wait! Am I ever gonna see you guys again? - I don't know how this works. I don't know if I'll get a free pass to visit Earth, but I'll see you up there, or down there, or wherever I go. - Oh, you're definitely going down there for sure. I'll let you know how it is up there, though. - I'm gonna miss you. - I'll miss you too. - You're like the big sister I never had, except for Jorge, of course. - Ouch, burned again. Gonna need some ointment for that one. - I'm gonna miss you too. - You know, it's just so nice that I'm gonna be missed so much, you know, I'm so glad. - I'm gonna miss you too, bud. - Aw, really? - Let's hug it out, come on. - All right. Oh. Up, down kinda thing? - I don't know. - All right. All right, peace out. - So can you do me a favor? - Anything. - Take care of this house and make some great memories. - Think I already started. - Here. - What's this? - Open it. So, should we end this like most '80s movie montages end? - I Wouldn't have it any other way. - Ahem. - Ahem. - Let's go make some new memories.
