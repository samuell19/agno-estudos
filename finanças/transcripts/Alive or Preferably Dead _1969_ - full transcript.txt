Are you leaving already, Mr. Mulligan? Unlucky night! Better luck next time! Sure. Merry Christmas, Wong! Thank you and a Merry Christmas to you, Sir! Oh, thank you, Sir. Merry Christmas! Same to you, Rosy! Cab, Sir? What's your name? Arthur, Sir. No thank you, Arthur. I prefer to walk. Help the blind! Please Sir, spare something for a poor old blind man! A gent who was So generous with a child, should have a lot more to give to her father, I guess. You guessed wrongly, my friend. Just shut up and hand your your money! ...or I'll scale you you just like a fish! That's highly improbable! I beg your pardon! You're a dead man! I'm not dead... and you're not blind! Cab, Sir? What's your name? Arthur, Sir. Yes, yes Arthur. That's enough for this evening. The key... Where is it? Turn on the lights. Thank you, the same to you. We didn't come here to be sociable. Just hand over our money. That's all. Well I'm sorry... you'll have to wait for your ten thousand dollars. I lost again. Ten thousand was the loan... But with the interests, it totals forty thousand. Forty thousand... ah, that's interesting! But it's all the same anyway, because I'm flat broke. You've got a rope? Upstairs. Thank you. Hey, what does he want a rope for? - To hang you. - What? No one has ever cheated the Macintosh brothers! Who's trying to cheat you? I just need a little more time. Sorry, but we can't wait any longer. Anyone can have bad luck. Lend me another two thousand and by the end of the year Il... You'll owe us fifty thousand. And still ask for more time! Hey, uh... take it easy! Killing me won't get you your money back! When I say I'm broke... I'm broke. We'll soon see about that. Something went wrong somewhere. Let me down and I'll answer it. No we can do that... Without your help. Mister Mulligan... Here I am! I'm sorry to disturb you _ in the midst of your Christmas decorating. Christmas is so nice when good friends celebrate It together. Why don't you - Tell Mister Mulligan your reason... - For disturbing him at this hour? Oh yes, of course. Mr. Mulligan, I'm the office boy from Lawyer Flattsons' office. He's been looking for you a whole week. Every lawyer in town is looking for me. Mr. Flattson sent three special delivery letters. Oh, That's no record! I've received over a dozen from some lawyers. What should I tell Mr. Flattson? That I'll pay him when I can. How's that? He said... He'll pay... As soon as he can. But hey... but Mr. Flattson isn't trying to collect. He has money to give you. And therefore, I leave as sole heirs to all my worldly possessions, my two nephews, Monty and Ted Mulligan the children of my deceased sister, Elisa Picson Mulligan. And uh, just what does it mean in dollars? Three hundred thousand, more or Iess. Where do I sign? Wait a minute, I haven't finished yet. Seeing as how my nephews are living apart and deploring the separation as I do, knowing the pain that it caused my poor deceased sister... I stipulate as condition to payment of the inheritance, that my two nephews live together for a period of six months. One hundred and eighty days? Yes... under the same roof where they will learn brotherly love, thus giving my poor deceased sister at least some final consolation. In due faith, et cetera et cetera... et cetera et cetera. Seems clear enough. Clear, my foot! Ted, my brother... I haven't seen him for years. I ‘ve no idea where he Is. We've found him at Big Peak. Big Peak? What the devil's that? A town out West. Clark Town. Big Peak. That way. Thanks. Do you live in these parts? Barnes is the name. I 've had a bit of bad luck at cards. Oh see. Afraid I lost everything... even my horse. I'm going to Big Peak. Can I offer you a ride? Why, thank you. - You don't see many of these around here. - I guess not. - IS it safe? - I think so. Hop in! Get a horse. A car is like a woman Push her too far and she'll boil over! But it gives us a chance to relax. Do you play poker Mr. Mulligan? Occasionally. How about a little game to pass the time? Why not? But didn't you say you'd lost everything? A real gambler always keeps something tucked away for hard times! Here we are. That's amazing! I'll deal Naturally... if you need a loan... Not at all. My brother's a big land owner. Well, the least I can do is drive you to your destination then. Birds of a feather! Is the West all as bad as this? No. Big Peak's worse. Well, have you made up your mind? Great throw there, Ted! That's going to be hard to beat. That's thirty eight cents. Well, You're next, Sam. There, I'll take these here. Samuel Logan, we're going right home, it's late. Wait a minute, this will be my last throw, I promise you. No it's always the same. We never get to bed before nine o'clock! Aw, come on, Rachel, it's Saturday night. Whiskey? Ah no... information. I'm looking for a guy called Ted Mulligan. What do you want with Ted Mulligan? He's my brother. What? Ted! But I don't want to live with you. We're not getting married. It's' only for six months. And besides, I never did like Uncle Archie. You're not being fair. He was just old fashioned, that's all. He believed in brotherly love. Aw... Nuts! Listen, three hundred thousand dollars aren' t nuts. To hell with it! You're not doing all that well. I'm doing fine. I ‘ve got a house, horses, that's all I need. Got a beer? No. Whiskey? Over there. If you can't hold your liquor, you should stick to milk. Expecting guests? NO, why? What do you do around here in the evening? Sleep. Where's my bed? You're sitting on it. I thought it was the table. That's the table. Where is the bathroom? Use the river 8 miles away. I go once a week. I mean the toilet. Out back. Can I have the lamp? That's the only one. OK, I get it. Watch the seat. Ah! Damn this dung heap! I've used that seat for ten years, and you bust it the first time you sit on it. Come in! Damn it, there's a handle. Not anymore. What brings you here? I brought your doorhandles... We need horses. I ain't got any to sell. Who asked to buy ‘em? I've only got two. His and mine. You can walk, can't you? So can you, Mister. He's asking for trouble. Don't listen to him, he don't count. I'll loan you the horses if you need ‘em. He doesn't. He's got two legs! Don't butt in. If Bad Jim wants the horses... He can pay for them. And get your feet off the table! You re not in a pigpen! Why you smart Alec! You gone crazy? Watch it, gentlemen! Ted, this boy is getting on my nerves. You're asking for trouble, Monty. He's already got it. Get going! We'll be back, Mister It's up to you. You're... crazy. You'd let that scum push you around? Now look what you've started! There's too much light in here. We're sitting ducks. That's better Don't be too sure. Get moving or we'll fry! How long are we supposed to live together? Only six months. Oh, some start! It could be worse. Worse! That's my house burning down! And just because it's your house, am I supposed to let some two-bit bandit push me around? But Jim ain't no “two-bit" bandit. He's number one around here. There goes the storeroom. That's good, they'll think we're dead. We might just be, before they're through! No house! No horses! And the land payment's due at the end of the month. In six months you can pay it off in one lump. I make my payment every month... I gave my word. I've given a lot of promises in my life. I keep mine. Don't shove! I'll shove when I feel like it! Sure, things look bad now but they'll pass. They'll pass when you get the hell outta here! I can hardly wait! Well then, go. Well then, go. What if I can get the money for the payment? How? Just give me a deck of cards and some rich gamblers. There ain't no rich gamblers in these parts. What about Flat Town? It's full of card tables. Flat Town? That hellhole! Lose or win. Full of sin. So I f we wish to keep our town all clean and nice. Take my advice. No cards or dice. Cards are a sin. Follow my spine to keep our dollars in the ring. At the rude hall, for every hero. You would find there are sinning goblins. He will lose from aiding to his sinful cheating table so. Pick up all your stuff Oh yeah. Dear friends and citizens of Flat Town, the time has come for all of us to fight against vice, which in a few short years has made a den of inequitv of Fair City. Our children look to us for guidance. Let us show them that their futures are safe in our hands. We sure picked the right day. But we must fight the good fight my friends and I promise with your help I will make this the cleanest city in the state. Let us gather our families about us and protect them from demon sin. Let us turn our backs on temptation and foolhardiness so that we can make a big success of our great moral campaign! Well, what now? Go to hell! Well, the first week is already past. Aren't you happy? I'd be happier if it was the last. Just think, in one hundred seventy three days we'll have three hundred thousand dollars. I'm thinking of the land payment due at the end of the month. Well if it isn't my old friend Mr. Mulligan! And his brother, I suppose. Can I give you a lift? No, thanks. Got a match? Just keep moving. I admit that I owe you an apology... And two thousand dollars. I'm short on cash at the moment. But the banks are full of it. - That 's a damn shame. - Come on gentlemen, hop in and let's talk. Now, as I was saying, the banks. There are clients who deposit, and clients who withdraw. - Yeah, with a gun. - Well of course. Is he crazy? Hold on Ted. He might have something. I know just the bank we should patronize. And I've got a plan that's foolproof. Remember a fool is a fool only if he's poor. That ain't no reason to turn outlaws. We're not outlaws, vet. This is a big country. There's room for everybody. In the jailhouse or on the gallows? This is a stick... oh! No sir, it's a step, not a stick. My poor man, did you hurt yourself? I'm terribly sorry, Sir. I can't imagine... It's nothing. What can we do for you? A deposit, a withdrawal, maybe cash a check? No... Ll... I was just looking for a friend. Back to work! Bungler! It could happen to anyone. It could only happen to you. Thieves can trip just like honest folk. Sure, but a bandit doesn't get up, beg his pardon, lose his nerve and beat it. Shhh... don't attract attention. You mean like that? Yes... I'd better be going. We'll meet at the old posthouse. I don't think anyone goes there nowadays. You know the place? I know it. Hey! Now you get away from the car, you're gonna scratch the paint. Say, your car's really beautiful. With your permission, Miss, may I offer you a ride? Sure! If he had a horse and buggy, he wouldn't have to crank it. Listen, why don't we change banks? The plans were made on this one and it's stupid to change them Just over one damn little step. The rain has caused the wood to swell. I'm terribly sorry. Believe me, sir, this never happened before. Well thanks, it's nothing. Alright now, everyone stand where you are! This is a hold-up... even if it doesn't seem like one. Hands up and face the wall! Hand over the money... and fast! This is a respectable bank. We don't want any blood-shed. uh, well, we don't want any either. Just don't try any tricks! Johnson, help the gentlemen! Yes, yes, of course. And those? Oh, come on, Johnson... a few sacks more or less! Here, take 'em son, they belong to the bank. No, they don't! I made out the deposit, so they're outta my hands. until they're entered in the bank accounts, they are still the clients responsibility. That ain't so! If I was home, I wouldn't be mixed up in this here robbery. But I ain't home. I'm here in this bank. And it's the bank that's being robbed. So the bank gotta answer for my money. Alright, alright, I'm convinced. But take my advice and change banks. You can bet your boots I will, sonny! Let 's go, quick! Now listen, everyone stay put for ten minutes! Barnes isn't here yet. Yeah wait till he sees this haul. Goddamn it! We risk our necks for a sack of pennies. Two sacks! I'd say we got about thirty dollars in all. At least we're got small change for a few years. I had a feeling... you can tell from the morning what kind of a day it Il be. I've had a belly full of your homespun proverbs! And I've had a bellyful of your smart ideas! My life's been full of troubles ever since you rode in! You call that life? It suited me. Who asked you to come nosing around? Believe me if it weren't for the inheritance, I d... To hell with the inheritance! You just can't wait to get your lousy hands on that damn money! Listen, I like money, but I don't intend to let that three hundred thousand dollars slip through my fingers for anything in the world! Oh no? It's Barnes! Just leave your guns alone and we Il get along fine. I'm not after your hides. I'm after your money. What money? The money that's hidden here! Everyone in the territory knows all about the holdup. And it wasn't really all that difficult to guess who'd done it. So, hand it over! There it is. Help yourself. Don't play games, tin horn! You took at least fifty thousand outta that bank! Fifty thousand... why you're crazy! No, the insurance. It's an old trick. You're the one trying to pull tricks! No, It's the truth, Jim. That's all we got. Now you're lying! Your brother's been leading you astray! Yeah, That's for sure. You're trying to be slick but sooner or later you're gonna tell me where you hid that fifty thousand dollars! Give me one of them hot pennies, I want to light up. Now nobody cross this line. It wouldn't be fair play. Now, ready to talk now? Sorry, Ted. I got you into a real mess this time. Forget it. Careful, Barnes. Ooh! my goodness! Don't shoot, you idiots! Damn it! Where the hell were you? The... uh, car broke down. Before or after the girl? Oh you know, during. How much do you think we'll get? At least twelve thousand. Well, that's good... mortgage falls due day after tomorrow. Only two thousand dollars and you talk about being the terror of the West! That's right. You ought to bring more. Two thousand dollars divided by the one hundred and fifty days left to go before we collect. That makes about... uh thirteen dollars a day. If we go easy it should last... Hurry up, the water's getting cold. I'm coming. What are you doing? You re still dressed? Just my long johns. You remember what Ma said. Yes, yes, but you can't wash like that. I'm washing and doing it... a damn sight better than any city slicker can. Get them off! But what if... suppose someone comes in? No one's going to come in! I'm keeping my hat on. Where are you going now? I'm not gonna strip in the middle of the room. How would you like it if somebody walked in here now? Stay put, my friend! You're supposed to be in prison. No shoulder room. I decided to leave. Where's your brother? He decided to leave too. We can do without him. All we want is the money. What money? That reward money you collected for turning me in. What's the sheriff get out of this? Just hand over the money. Jim, if that gun goes off, the whole town will be in here. Alright, no fireworks. But fists don't make noise. Watch out, Ted! What are you after, Daddy? You'll find out baby doll. Well, sugar boy, are you coming or not? I sure am... That's enough! Hand over the money. I'll blow his brains out. That's highly improbable. I thought you took your bath in the raw. But not unarmed! Those aren't firecrackers! Don't worry about it, darling. Stay with me a little longer, I'm lonesome. I gotta go and help my friends. Stay with me, don't go... don't go. I'll be right back, honey. I'm coming! Jim! Let's go! What are you doing? Trying to stop the flood. We gotta pay for these damage. Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Didn't I tell you? Movies, they're a great invention. Why, you can learn more here than you even could by robbing stage coaches for six months. You sure can. Okay... Not too bad for the first time... Hey... This time it's bound to work. Whoa. .. perfect! Here it comes and it's loaded! Well, boy, in a little while, we re going to be very rich men! Hey! Take it easy, take it easy, nothing to worry about. Just a little accident. I'm sorry, it ain't no accident. It's a holdup! A real holdup! How exciting! I've heard all about them but I never thought I'd actually be in one! Wait until I tell my girl friends about this, they'll be so jealous of me, they Il just die! I m so excited. Hey! Hey! It ain't possible! Well, I told you, didn't I? I think it's so amusing. Well, look at all these things, aren't they beautiful? Don't you just love this one? My daddy had It specially sent from Paris. He's so good to me, my daddy. He gives me everything. That's no way to treat a lady! Won't someone give this rude man a lesson? Now listen, you! You touch one hair on Miss Scott's head, man, and her Pa will have your hide! Scott? Scott. The banker's daughter. The Scott Bank, of course! Dear Daddy... I'm writing to tell you that on my way home, the stage was held up and I was kidnapped by three fierce bandits... Period. Now, if you wish to see me in the near future in the near future... You will have to pay a ransom of one thousand dollars. A thousand dollars! Yes. Why, what's wrong? Is it too much? We don't want to force him into doing something drastic... You have kidnapped me for a miserable thousand dollars! Oh but... but you'll be back home in a couple of days if your father pays at once. If you'd only wanted a thousand dollars, why didn't you kidnap the baker's daughter? We had no other choice. I have never been so offended In all my life! To think that you robbed that coach and you dragged me out here in this squalor and this dirt for a miserable... I'll never be able to tell my friends about this. I Il never be able to... How about a... a thousand three hundred? I'm so upset, about all this, you can't imagine! This body... it's so dirty, It's horrible! It's awful! Alright, alright. I apologize. How much? Two thousand? Three? You tell us! Ten thousand. If you want daddy to take you seriously. Ten thousand! She's crazy! You ask for too much and you get nothing! Oh you shush! I won't shut up. If your Pa won't pay... if your Pa won't pay... Enough! That's enough! One at a time or we get nowhere. Sit down. Okay, okay. Well... where were we? Oh, yes... You will have to pay a ransom of ten thousand dollars... uh, within a week's time. Is that alright? By the way, I get thirty percent. Why? You need some new underwear? Good luck! And do your best! Okay! On, I'm sleepy. A girl needs rest after such a tense exciting day. Let me doit. You aren't mad at me, are you? Who... I? Well... I'd like to, uh... That's highly improbable. We'll have to lock you in, I'm sorry. Oh yes, yes, please do. I just love the idea of being locked in. It's so romantic... like harems and vails and all those romantic things! I'm going to keep a diary, and I'm going to write down every detail of this precious experience. And then someday, I'm going get published. ohyes, I'm just certain of it. Of course, you realize, Mr. Scott, that I'm only an intermediary. Uh, you might say, an ambassador at large. Nothing doing. Am I to assume that you won't comply with the conditions imposed by the bandits? Exactly. But you understand that these men are unscrupulous? Perfectly. And that' she'll have to endure... all sorts of hardships. She can take it. But your attitude will certainly infuriate the bandits. I assume all responsibility. But if it's a question of the money, Mr. Scott, I'm authorized to bargain. Of course, the sooner you pay the sooner you Il see your daughter again. Mr. Barnes, I can see that you haven't grasped the problem. Possibly not. My problem is not to get my daughter back as soon as possible, it's to keep her there as long as possible. Let's say, on vacation. Am [...am I to assume... You may assume anything you like, Mr. Barnes. The fact is that Scarlett is an adorable child... in small doses. I see. Then you can also see that I cannot let such an opportunity slip through my fingers. They kidnapped her well, they can keep her for a while! You got it!? Miss Scott! Miss Scott! Open it! Damn it, she got away! Didn't I tell you? If she's taken the horses, we're in for it! We're in for it anyway! Where do you think you are? In a saloon? Somebody's gonna have to teach you boys how to behave. How did you get down here? You were sleeping so soundly... and there was a nice little tree next to the window. So I climbed down the tree and I came in the door... I'll go take care of that tree right away! It's not very hard to get out of a... You'll eat first! Besides, it's too late now. Let's eat. You both need a good breakfast before you begin to work. Stop Oh Ted, I just love to watch you cut wood. Why? Because you're so strong and rugged. on!1 just... no, please go on... The way you swing that axe, oh, does funny things to me. Scarlett! God makes man, and woman uses him! Right? No fish? No, I'm afraid not. Scarlett? Yes? I uh, could I... I... I ask you something personal? Personal? Yes. DO you... do you have a boy friend? Why? I uh... I... it's just that when uh, I see you I kind of feel... that is, uh... I think, uh... Well, I think, uh, I min love with you. Oh Ted! That's the nicest compliment I've ever had! But you've no idea how my life has changed since Scarlett was kidnapped! I feel ten years younger! So do I... But all good things must end. Alright, I understand. Now let's see... you've kept her three weeks for ten thousand dollars, now, how much would you want to keep her for let's say, another month? ...another ten thousand? Another ten thousand ? Don't forget, I could report this to the sheriff. I'll talk to my clients. Oh, Scarlett! Scarlett! No, no, no! Ted, I'm naked! Alright, I won't Look at you. I will. Go away, I have to get you. What did you say? I said, uh, it's so nice in here, I hate to get out! No hurry, I'll wait. Enjoy yourself! Enjoy yourself. Ted said you should! You're a monster! Scarlett! Y'know, I've thought about us a lot, and I've made up mind. About what? Well, uh, I'm gonna marry you... We'll forget all about the ransom... uh, send my brother packing and go back to my ranch... and then get married. I'm sorry, Monty. I know you counted on that money, but Scarlett's happiness comes first. How'd we get here? Where's Scarlett? Far away... far away. You dirty bastard! Why bring Ma into it? Don't try to be smart, you double crossing rat! You should be grateful. Can't you see? I saved your life! I don't want my life to be saved. I want to be left alone! To bang your head against the wall? It's my head and I do what I want with it! I've been happy for twenty years... then you come along and ruin everything! Ruin everything? Ruin everything with three hundred thousand dollars? I'm gonna kill you Monty, sure as God! Now you're going too far! Go away! It's the best thing you can do. You just get out of my life... before it's too late! You hear? Ted, stop! You're a couple of fools to leave that girl out there alone! She's got a roof over her head. Besides, I had no choice. What if something happens to her? Don't worry, nothing's gonna happen to her. Well? How is he, Doctor? He is sleeping now. Is it bad? Fractures all over his body. He didn't seem to be in much pain. Maybe he didn't want to alarm us. Pain numbs the brain after a time. Ohyes, I see. Got any whiskey? Yes, Yes. Can't operate without it. Well, 1 got to put him in a cast. Need am help? No, no, no thank you. Let him sleep now. You can come for him... let me see, In the morning. Don't, worry, don't worry, gentlemen, he Il be quite safe In my hands. Forget the ransom money. They should have delivered it tonight. We can't take risks now. I ‘'m the only one who takes any risks. Go out to the house, nick up the girl, put her off in the nearest town and come back here as fast as you can. What if she asks about you? We... we were captured, sentenced and hung. Right. Well, he's waking up! Well done, well done. That's perfect, perfect! Slowly... slowly! Up! Up! A little more... That statue, is it yours? That's no statue, that's my brother. How come you're wearing those guns? They're mine. You'll have to hand ‘em over. I haven't done anything wrong. And you won't... if I take them. What is this? No guns allowed in town on Thursdays. Calm down Ted. Just rest and get well. I can't understand you, Ted. Don't waste your breath. Uh no uh... what's that? Alright, alright. Take it easy. I'll get you a straw. Stop me stop me! Beg your pardon, where can I buy a straw? At the drugstore around the corner. Thanks. Who is it? We've come to settle our accounts. Uh no Jim I'm sick... Thanks. What's going on today? It's the weekly gold shipment. That's why those characters are hanging around? There's no danger, they don t have any guns. They just like to watch, that's all. But doesn't the sheriff do anything? Why should he? They don't do any harm. There's a fortune in there. You could live off if comfortably for the rest of your life that is, if you intend on living that long. Check and make sure they're loaded. The cast is only a trick! get up and fight! Hey, I'm alright! Damn it! the sheriff he's after us now! But we weren't even in on it! - You try convincing him! - That's right. I had the gun There they go! What? Step on it, I'll explain later. Good morning. What a wonderful day! Wonderful day? You must be out of your mind! Come on, it's useless to argue. Listen, everything is useless with you. You bitched about the conditions of my ranch, and my, just look where you've dragged us! At least it's safe here. We can leave as soon as Barnes finds something better. Boothill is the only safe place for the likes of you two! Hey! Monty! News! News! Great news! Now listen... on Friday a gold shipment leaves for Pony Center from the Scott Bank in Short Town. The three of us... You can count me out! I've had enough. Come on, Ted, you've only got another two months to go. Well, that's too long! How did you find out about this gold shipment? Mr. Scott made a slip. You know he and I have become close friends. Scarlett! It's not the car... What are you practicing for? Escort duty. Escorting what? A gold shipment. You ‘re rangers? Yeah. We're escorting the Scott shipment. But..., why all the publicity? Someone's bound to get bad ideas. Anyone with bad ideas knows the risks... and gives them up immediately. Right? Oh, yeah. Ninety four, ninety five, ninety six, ninety seven, ninety eight, ninety nine, one hundred! It's a hold up rangers! Drop your guns! And with that, we pull the emergency brakes... Barnes unloads the automobile and we pass the gold down. Come on, let's try it again. What, again? We're coming into Pen City... Here's the station, now. Careful... Howdy. Are you taking this train, too? Yeah... just to Pony Center. Business. Goodbye. You're a professional? Amateur, Sir. How'd they turn out? Wobbly. Hey, boys! How about a card game, huh? Sure. Right here, this is a good place. Now that we're underway, I can tell you something. What's that, Captain? There's no gold in this strong box. What? It's full of sand. Whose idea was that? Mr. Scott's. Where's the gold, then? Back in the cattle car, in the case marked “Dynamite” One, two, three... Three, four... Eleven, twelve, thirteen... Sixteen, seventeen, eight... Eighty three, eight four... Ninety seven, ninety eight, ninety nine and one hundred! It's a hold up! He's right, Look! Thanks. Take cover! You arrived just in time. If it hadn't been for you, they would have taken us by surprise! Get'em! EXCuse me, excuse me, excuse me. There's none there anyway... Look! They're heading for the engine! Don't Let them stop the train. Follow me! You, too! But what about the gold? Forget it! Hey! You again? I could say the same to you! Get back! Get back! Get back! Get back! The gold! I said, forget it! Hey, where the devil you going? Come back! Where you, heading? The gold isn't in the... Don't worry. I'll take care of it! What's going on? You'll find out! Ted! Who else? It's about time he got moving! I've swung an axe, too! We'd better slow down. We'll lose them if we do! We'll be flying if we don't! Hey, the dynamite! the gold's inside! the dynamite! What'd he say? Dynamite! Dynamite! The dynamite! Dynamite! Dynamite! If we crash, we'll be blown sky high! Jump! Jump Ted, jump, what are you waiting for! Jump! Ted! It's too much! My brother... the gold... three hundred thousand dollars... Scarlett... all gone with the wind! It s too much, even for me. Wait till the Macintosh brothers hear about this! Macintosh? What... what do you know about those blood suckers? You might not believe this but they sent me out here keep an eye on you. You damned impostor! I'll show youl! Look... look! I don't know how we can thank you. You've cleared the country of Bad Jim and his gang ...and that was a great idea to dump the gold so that we could pick it up. But how did you guess that the gold was in the dynamite case? Mr. Barnes is a close friend of Banker Scott. And now it's with fatherly pride that I offer this rare example of the great American pioneer tradition, the hand of my daughter Scarlett, my only child, my lovable, irreplaceable Scarlett. Come on, son take her... she's yours. What I said goes. You deserve her, boy. Get out of my way! Where is he? Where's that double-crossing brother of mine? Ted! Ted, we thought you were dead! Thank God, he's alive! I'm saved! Oh, Ted! Ted, you're really, really safe! Yeah, by a miracle. That current actually carried me over two counties down river. I get back and what do I find? You are already consoled with my brother! Come on, Ted, look! No, Monty, this time, I'm gonna kill you! Mean it. But this is ridiculous, Ted! I warned you! A duel! They're gonna fight a duel over me! How exciting! One of them is bound to get killed. Just as long as one of them survives! Alright, Ted... have it your way. Come here, I want to talk to you. Go ahead, kill me. I will... But before I do, I wanna know one thing. What is Scarlett to you? And to you? I've really got to know. Nothing. She's nothing to me either. I hope those two come to their senses. Ready! Quick! Quick, let's get out of here! Damn it! It was too good to be true! I'm ruined! I beg your pardon, Mr. Barnes... are you married? No... Monty! Ted! Wait for me! Wait for me!
