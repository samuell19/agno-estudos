- Hey, what's up? Ivan, it's Christian. Oh my God, I'm so excited to see you soon. I'm just like, literally, at work right now and I just cannot think about anything but getting on a plane to Columbia. Oh my God, it's fucking like, I really am just over the moon with excitement, but I'm not calling you to reiterate that. So, I hope this is okay. I know that I'm kinda springing this on you, and call me if this is a problem, but I actually bought a ticket for my brother Cole, to join me on the trip. I think you'll really like him and the reason that I've, that I've done this is that he, he just, and I trust that you won't mention this, but um, so, he's sort of just coming out of like a manic episode, which he definitely struggles with from time to time. He went through a bad breakup and I just sort of really need this to be like a, I don't know, like a peaceful, calm trip for him. I just like, I really worry for him. He struggles, you know. He's not like a, he has issues. We can get into it in more detail later but, yeah. Ah boy, I'm rambling, okay so, that's the news, that's the story. Cole's coming with me and uh, yeah. I hope that's okay, I think it will be. All right, God, this is a long message. All right, love ya man, talk soon, bye. - Hey. - Hey, how are you? - Good. - Well, I just hung this. I'm trying to figure out if this blue is too much with this other blue so close by. - I think it looks interesting. - Interesting. - Yeah, I don't know, this is not my bag. I think I'm nervous about this show, actually. - Hey, it's not even a big show. Just, let your work be seen. Breathe. You're a great artist. - I'm a great artist, yeah. How are you? - Good, I'm excited. - Mmm, yeah. - Waiting for your next piece to be ready. - Oh, God! Oh, God, I'm so sorry, shit, you should've reminded me. Okay, yeah, I have these friends coming into town. I was like, thinking about that, I forgot. - That's okay. - Haven't worked on it since you first mentioned it like two weeks, well, I worked on it a little bit, but-- - It's okay. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I'll just go-- - Just-- - Work on it now. Okay. - Get to work. - Yeah. Bye. - Love you. - Love you. You're a beautiful monster. Come here man! Dude, you're fucking here! - Oh my God. - Hi, I'm Cole. - Ivan. - Wait, Ivan, Cole, my brother. Wait, so, it's so surreal of me if you guys haven't, did you meet at SC or am I imagining that? - We did. - Okay, freshman open studios. That's when it was, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay, amazing. - Yeah, he was wearing glasses. You were wearing glasses, yeah? - Okay, fantastic. - You got him stoned for the first time. - Yeah, that happened. - I, let me wash this off and then I'll show you guys your bedrooms. - Oh, we get our own bedrooms? - Well yeah, you share one. Cole, do you want water? - I'm okay, thank you. - It's incredible. So, we have this all to ourselves? - Yeah. - Wow. - It's my parents'. - Nice. Cole, what are you doing? Come on. - What's your favorite part about Columbia? - The beach. - Oh, cool. Right. - The men, too, there's very hot men here. - Cool, that's cool. - It's a nice perk. - Well, it's cool, good men. - So wait, what are you guys gonna get? I can't understand any of this. - Oh,. - Oh, I love seeing you man. - Do you feel like I've gotten fatter here, all around here? With age, I feel like I'm getting like, I'm, fatter. - Ivan, oh. Is this why you brought us out here, so you could just like-- - Dude no! - So you could ask us if you'd gotten fat? - No, no, no. - Have I gotten fat? Is my hair falling out? - You look really good. - Thank you. - Am I going bald? Please, can you just take this in? You actually look better than you've ever looked. You're so gorgeous. Beautiful, handsome. Sexy. I just want you to, I really would love for you to be able to see yourself the way I see you. It's just so great. - Thank you. - Cole, what do you think? - I think he's, I think you're-- - He's handsome. - I think you're very handsome. - He's an extremely handsome, very interesting looking guy. It's paradise! - What? - It's paradise! So, I'm up there and I'm literally, like, this is being all televised-- - Uh huh. - It's like, I don't know, it's for like, one of those like, very obscure cable shows, but still, it's like TV, and I'm up there and I'm giving the talk and I feel like it's going well and then I can see like, in this like, it's kinda, it's hard to explain but it's kind of like a teleprompter. I can see the reflection of the images behind me and the cropping is so fucked. Like, on one of the portraits, the guy's head is like, not even there, and this part of me just like, gets so angry 'cause I'm like... Do you think I have a right to be mad at her for doing that? - Yes, she fucked it up. - Ivan. Ivan. Do you know where the Ibuprofen is? Ivan, do you have any Ibuprofen? - Yes. - I have a headache. - I can't even deal with peoples' egos anymore. Just like, listening to these actors come in and talk about themselves. Yeah, I'm just at the point where I hate taking head shots so much that if someone's not willing to pay me like, $500 to do it, I'm just not gonna do it. - I get that. - Yeah. - I really get that. What do you guys wanna do today? - I wanna shop. - Oh, how much for one of these? - $6,000, what's in them? - They're cornmeal, they're all made of cornmeal and then they have different, they're like fried, deep fried cornmeal and then they have different stuff inside, like cheese or meat or some of them are sweet. - Where you from? - The States. - Whereabout in the States? - Tennessee, I grew up in Tennessee. These guys, these guys are from Texas. - Huh? I'm just kidding, I knew you were there, but you're gorgeous, both of you. Absolutely stunning. Texas, Texas, L.A. I'm interested. Ask me to sit down. - Sit down, please. - Mmm, hot. So, what the hell you doing in Columbia? - I work here. I live and work here. I live in a house that belongs to my parents and then they're visiting. This is my best friend from college, Christian and his brother, Cole. - I'm just here for the sex. - Men or women? Or a little somewhere in between? - He likes women. So do I. But I'm a photographer. I'd love to take your photo, if that's something you'd be interested in. - I think I'm gonna get rid of my hotel room tonight and stay with you guys. - We have room, so you can sleep at our place. - The more the merrier. - I'm in. - You little slut. - Ooh. Oh guys, this is Cole and Christian. They're straight, and this is Ivan. He's a fag. - Wait, what's your name again? - Eli, like Eli-- - And who are these people? - Like Eli Whitney and the cotton gin? - Yes! - Hey, I'm Tatiana. - Hey, what's up, Christian. - Hi. - What's up Elizabeth? Cole. Nice to meet you. - Hey. Wait, are you guys rolling? - I don't know, are you? - Ah, no, but we could be. - Well. Good thing we brought enough. - Do you have enough for me and my brother? - We have enough for the whole world. - Why are they so... - Really? - Sorry, sorry. Calm. - But that's the thing about being gorgeous. You're gorgeous when you believe you are. If you don't think you're gorgeous, well then maybe you're not. I don't know. I'm sure when you're sure. - I'm sure if I'm sure. - We are eternal, this eternal stream that just goes like this-- - And anxiety's in there? Or you're not talking about anxiety. - And so everything's in there. It's everything in there. - But isn't neurosis like the stopping of that natural-- - Well, I mean if you-- - Neurosis doesn't feel like another natural thought. It feels like a nega, a stopping. - And that's part of the stream, too. Your reaction to the feeling that you're anxious and you shouldn't be. It's like, it's like at a certain point, you just, you get used to the stream running through you and you go, oh, I'm literally a conduit for some indescribable mysterious energy that I try to control sometimes and manipulate and then other times, when I'm on vacation, I feel totally comfortable with just going, oh, I have no idea what I'm gonna do today and then all of these, all of this magic happens and people get ideas and, like, you know, creative and, so creative people. - I don't know, yeah. I guess he's not a good guy. - Does that make you feel better about yourself, if he's not a good guy? - No, no, I just know he's not a good guy, 'cause there's a difference between being successful and good. - Oh, God. - Yeah. - Not in America. - I mean it doesn't, why do you need to, why do you need to, why does he need to be good or bad? - Hey. - Hey. - You can come in. - You done? - Just about. It's good music huh? - Mm. - I like it. - What? Did you pee? - No . - I didn't hear pee. You bladder shy? I can leave. What? Nope. Ivan, I, whoa, no I'm sorry. I don't um. - What? - Whoa, whoa, no Ivan seriously. I'm sorry. Sorry. - What's up with you? Did you try kissing Cole in the bathroom? I wasn't trying to make you upset, I was just saying, I don't know what I was saying. I have this friend Charlie, I think he'd fuck you. You wanna meet him? - Oh fuck, oh my God, I'm gonna come. - Oh my God. Oh my God, it's so deep. Oh my God, it's so deep, it's so deep, it's so deep. - Hi. I um, I ah, Do you love me? - What happened earlier? - What do you mean? What happened earlier? Huh? - That's why you didn't wanna, you acted like I was crazy. - Yeah. - It doesn't matter. - No. - Oh. - I'm not gay. Okay. Good night. - Good night. - Friend. - Mm. - Thank you for having us. - Mm. Where the hell's that turtle water smell coming? - The pineapple ones taste exactly like pineapple. - He's still in the bathroom? - Snozzberries taste like snozzberries. - That green apple are bad. - The clear ones are incredible. - What do they call green apple in Spanish? - I don't think I got a clear, I think I got a lemon. - Can you believe I knew that? - Are you in love with Cole? - No. - You guys think Elizabeth is in love with Cole? - Mm. - Probably. - Do you guys think we're all gonna be friends forever? - Yes! We already are. Friendships forever. Even if we never see each other again. - I'm ah, I'm shocked you're not in love with him. I find him incredibly charismatic. - Oh he's great, amazing. - Good looking. - Sexy. I'm having so much fun with him. - How is the sex? - It's only in American culture-- - It's not sexy. - Discomfort. Japanese cultures sit on wooden stools. - It's true. - There's also a problem in Japan of people working until they just die at the office. It's called karoshi. - But they're not in discomfort. - I'm not kidding. You don't know about that? - Or they're ignoring the discomfort. - Oh he's back. - Who is it? - Look what he's got. - He has some kind of gift. - What's he doing? - He's doing a thing. - He's delaying our, he's delaying gratification. - Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Ow! - Finally. - Aww. - Wow. - Oh that's beaut-- - I don't wanna become those guys. I hate being on the outside. - That's fine. - You wanna fuck me? - Yeah. Come one. - You wanna fuck me? Shh. All right. - Okay, wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up! It's time to start the day. It's nine o'clock. It's a good day. - Morning. - Are you sure you wanna go to the beach? - Or what? - Oh I just feel so horny. Oh honey. - [Elizabeth, Oh, ho, ho. - What am I gonna do? Got all these feelings. Oh yah. Oh yah. Muah. Muah. - How'd you sleep? - Not that good. - I beat you. Where were you last night? - When? I woke up at like 2:00 a.m., I tried to find you and I couldn't do it. - You couldn't do it? - Couldn't find you. - Where did I go? - Yeah. - Uh, I woke up and went swimming. You went swimming at 2:00 a.m.? - Yeah. Is that weird? - No it's not weird. It's just, I guess I'm impressed. - Yeah, no, I went swimming. - Wasn't it cold? - It was warm. - Ivan. I love you so much. I almost shit my pants. I almost shit my pants. - So you're a lover? You're like a love-- - I love pussy, yeah. - Like Casanova lover. - Hey. - Hey. Oh yeah. Oh. God I love you. - Good night. - Okay, so I'm really bad at driving my dad's truck, I guess. I don't know, I think I'm pretty good. And I was tryna get into the um liquor store, and these lesbians were coming out of the car, no in a car, so thought oh we're in the same community. You know, and I was like, 'cause the like looked already, just scowling at like me in this car and I was like, "No, I'm vulnerable, "like I'm the victim too. "We're the victims." - You know? - Oh right, 'cause you're like you're my people. - Yeah, and so they, and I was like okay, okay, they wanna play that game, so if I just-- - Wait, they wanted to take your spot? - No, no, they were coming out and I was coming in. And I was like-- - You were cutting them off? - No, no, not even that. It just, it was a very tight kinda parking. - Narrow street. - Oh and they were like mad. - Well they just already had their guards up, and so if I showed like look I'm a fairy. And then I was like that's not working. I was like, "It's not my truck." She had to be like, roll the window down to like, "What?" And I was like, "First time driving a truck." Like thinking like everywhere else in LA if I do that, someone's like, "Oh, Angel Cakes." You know? "It's been a rough life and we believe in you." But she just goes, she just shoves right back in my face, "I can tell." Which is her sense of humor. I get it, but I also was like ah! Like she made me like close up that negative energy. And the next think I know, I hear. I scratched the car. - No. - Right next to me. - Wow. - Because of her negative energy. - Hey. - Were you waiting for someone? - Was I waiting for someone? - Yeah. - No, I was just doing whatever. - Cool. - You drunk? - Suck my dick. - Fuck yeah. - Don't touch him okay. He's not like you. - Yes, sorry. - I will kill you. - Yeah, sorry. Ow. - Shh, shh, shh. See you in the morning. - Hey. Where've you been? I thought you disappeared. You weren't answering my messages. - I went camping. - Oh. - Here's this. - What is that? Yeah. It's wonderful. - Ah shit. - Eyes are different. - Mm, yeah. - You're seeing someone new. - I'm seeing someone new. - Oh. - It's not going very well. - Yeah. - I'll keep you posted. - Well you're special to us. - Okay. Love you. - If you ever wanna talk. - Okay. - Let me know. Oh, is this wet? - No it's dry. - Okay. Thank you. Oh. Thank you again. - Still got it! - It's a boy. - Ah, man. Why are you wearing a suit and a tie? - Oh, I had like, I had actually some neck trauma last night. - What, what do you mean? What? - This guy, so I'm in love with this guy, and his brother's my best friend, and everything has always been cool with me and his brother and I'm gay. - Yeah. But then like apparently now that I'm hooking up with his brother, it's like too close to home or something, or some homophobia is coming up. - Oh right, 'cause he's jealous. - Oh, well I don't know, maybe, that hadn't occurred to me. - He's gay right? - No, they're both straight, allegedly, or they are both like heretofore straight like up 'til now. - Right, right, he's probably just jealous of whatever attention you're giving his brother. Right? I don't know. Wow, I'm like a therapist. - Are you my fairy godmother? - Yeah, of course. I had a gown on but it's so hot. - Hey. Where's everyone? - Where've you been? Where've you been? We've been waiting for you. - I was out. I had took a painting to my dealer, and then, I actually met up with this friend of mine, Stefanie, who I think I'm gonna have over for dinner. - Is she hot? - Mm hm. - Cool. - Cool. - I think that's why people come her though, is the beautiful women, not the men. Like I feel like I got that wrong. I came here to see beautiful people, and like hook up with a Latin guy and like get a little frisky. But the problem is, the only beautiful people here are the women. I was in Vegas like three weeks ago, and I was with two of my good girlfriends, and I was like, "Dude, why don't we like just stay in, "and not like go out. "Like stay in and order pizza." And anyway, I almost convinced them. And this girl that I kinda didn't know that well came out of the shower and she was like, "Fuck that, I wanna go out and party." And I was like dammit, like I could've stayed in pajamas. And so anyways, we went out and we had this like, it was like an okay night. We were like dancing with these disgusting men that bought us drinks, but we felt that we owed them our time because they bought us drinks you know. And I don't know why I'm telling you this story. - It's cool. - The beach, the beach. - Oh the beach, right, right, right. My point is, I love it here, 'cause you can go to the beach at night. And it's so close to the house. It's like within walking distance to the house. So then you can just come back and go to sleep whenever you want. - Oh it's so warm! - I really care about you. You mean a lot to me. - You too. Come here. I love you. - I love you. - I love you. - I love you. - I love you. - Okay. What the fuck man, what the fuck man? You thought I was gonna fall for that? That girl's not even my type. You think I like fucking comedians? Look at me, look at me. I told you. I told you. It was nice being your friend Ivan. I hope you die of fucking regret. - Ivan. No, no, no. No, stop, no. I'm sorry. - Come here. - Hey. How you doing? You okay? What happened to you last night? You seem a little rocked. - What did I do wrong? - Nothing. You fell in love with a straight boy. It happens. And his brother got really upset. - We love you so much Ivan. - You don't know me. - Yes we do. We love you so much Ivan. - I would've fucked them too. Maybe I will. Maybe I have. The point is, everything in this world is absolutely free. - No. - I'm gonna get you back. - Where've you been? - I just wanted you to know that I'm gonna go camping. - But the reception's tomorrow. - I know. But I gotta make it. I just fell in love with this straight guy just now and it was really fucking horrible. And I've done it many times and it went farther than it ever has, and it's like a sickness I have. And now I can't see him anymore and I feel like I'm gonna die. I feel like I'm in withdrawal, you know? And I don't get it, like I don't know if it's like a real problem, or if it's like um, what I don't know is if we actually fell in love or not, or if it was like a trick or like a thing where I was manipulating him or something. Which his brother thinks I was manipulating. - You weren't, I'm sure. You're not like that. - Yeah, but I like opened him up to this higher space and we fell in love. - Yeah, and that's not manipulation. - Right. - He's just scared - Yeah, so I just kind of need to... He's gone. They dumped me, he dumped me, they left. I got like beat up basically but like not that intensely. More emotionally. This guy's my best friend and he just fucking left town with his brother, like just, I've never felt love like I just experienced. - Hey. Guy's got bigger fish to fry, I guess. - Apparently. - Fuck you. Fuck you. - That was some wild stuff. If that was on Facebook, I would've given it a heart. - Oh. - So you American? - Yeah. - Where are you from? - I grew up in Tennessee but now I live, or I lived in LA for years but now I live here, but I still have a place in LA. - Tennessee to LA to Columbia. We're from Florida. - Florida. - Oh cool. - We saw you dancing earlier. - Oh thanks. Did you like it? - We loved the show. - Did you hear me screaming? - Yeah a little bit. - I think the whole beach heard you screaming. - Oh, good, yeah. What are you guys doing in the park? - This one needed to decompress and talk. - Showing him the old spot. - Talk about his ex all day. - Listen, I'm not talking about my ex. My girlfriend, ex-girlfriend, used to take me here. But then she dumped me. And then I lost my job writing for the New Yorker. - Oh wow, that's very impressive. You must be a great writer. - It was impressive. If he was a great writer, he'd still be at the New Yorker. - Oh they fired you? - Yeah. - What did you do? - I just kinda tailspinned after she left and it wasn't a good thing, and I wasn't good to anybody, and I wasn't, just wasn't good to me. Now I come out here to think about some things. Process. - You used to come with her? - Used to come with her once. - But now you're coming with this guy. What's your name? What are your names? - Peter, I'm Peter. - Peter, Peter too. - Oh cool. - We're both Peters. - We're both peters. - Yeah. And he thought he would treat me to his whole, his whole relationship sob story. - Yeah instead, I brought him out here and he likes the beach kind of and he's just giving me sarcastic remarks so it's been great. How 'bout you, you come out here to do some thinking of your own? - Yeah. Yeah I just went through kind of a breakup of my own, if you could call it that. - If you can call it that? - It was like a very complicated romantic, situation. - Have you ever heard of the author, Eli Greene Houseman. - No. - Really, never? - I don't think so. - You sure? - I think you do. - Pretty sure you do. He's like a spiritual shaman, spiritual blogger. - Moves around the earth and treats people with his genius. - Yeah, he does like very fluid Snapchats and Instagram posts. - Tall. - Gangly, googly eyes. - Gay. - Kinda slightly-- - Very gay. Offset makeup, extremely gay. Gayer than this banana. Which I'm gonna shove in my mouth. - You think I know him 'cause he's a gay guy? - He's gay and-- - You guys, yeah you guys all mature. - That's true. - He's kinda like you but not, but like you, you know, he's got big googly eyes. - I know a guy named Eli with big googly eyes, I think. - It's probably him. - I doubt that it's him. I don't think this guy's an author. - Pull out his Instagrams or something. - I have one of his cards. This one says medical doctor. Do you know that person? - There he is. - Well, well, well, if it isn't my stupid little idiots. Let me guess, we're all going to LA. - Welcome to this-- - Oh. - shitty apartment Should we just go? - Let's go. - Thank you. - Let's go. - Here we go. - Hey. I'm not tryna hurt your brother, I brought you guys this. - What is that? - It's a painting I made for you. I wanted to-- - Okay, show it to me. - Here, take it. It's a gift. - All right. - Hey Cole! - We should leave. - Cole. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - We should leave. - Hey. - Get this motherfucking guy outta here, okay! He's trespassing on private property! - Okay, okay. - Cole. Cole. Cole. I care about you. - Shh. Shh. Shh. - Open the window. - What the fuck are you doing? - I care about you. Open the window. - You're fucking psychotic. - I'm not. - Yeah, you are. - Open the window. - No. - Come out here. - No. - Come out here. - No. - Come out here or I'll kill myself. - That's not funny. - Hey. - You have to leave. - Cole. - You gotta leave, you gotta. - Cole. - Just stop it, just leave. - Why are you being like this? Why are you being like this? - Ivan stop. - This is ridiculous. - This is not, this is not. - I'm not a crazy person. This is over, all right. - What is what? Cole. Why are you acting like this? - Acting like what? It's over, okay. I'm not gay. Columbia was different. I was experimenting. - This sounds fake. - I was-- - So this-- - I was experimenting. - This is, what is, your parents told you to say this? - You're, you're-- - I'm right here, it's me. - Okay. You're very special. You're very cool. You're very smart. - I'm like a gay guy who-- - This is not, this is not-- - is like trying to destroy your life. - We are not in a relationship or anything like that. Okay? I have a girl in my bed. Right now. And I really don't want you to bother her. Okay? - You tryna hurt my feelings? You knew that would hurt my feelings, right? - I'm sorry. - Cole. Come here. Just come. Why? I'm not, I'm not a delusional person. - This is a delusion. This is a delusion. It's a delusion that you're obsessed with. Okay. And I'm not a part of it anymore. - So what was that then? - What was what? - What was like, what was like the most real. - I told you I was-- - You're gonna make me like-- - I told you I was experimenting. That's all that was, all right. - You know I think that, I'm just gonna put my hands here. - I'm a straight guy. - I think that people-- - I'm a straight guy. - are brainwashing you. - I'm a straight guy. - Yeah, but that's not a thing. It doesn't exist. - What are you talking about? What are you talking about? - People used to think the world was flat and then it became obvious that it's round. It's not a... You're just-- - I'm sorry Ivan. - You're a modern-- - I'm sorry I-- - You're really gonna treat me like I'm crazy, because I came here and act like we didn't fall in love. - You should go. You gotta go. - Okay. Okay just calm down. Calm down. - Christian. Christian. Christian! - What did I tell you! That's it. What the fuck did I tell you faggot! I hate you! I'll fucking end your life. Fuck off. - Christian. No. - Ow. Ow. - Go! Go! - Everything is love. - Go! - Did you try to go rescue Cole last night? - How did I not wake up when he was leaving? - I couldn't have woken up. I have borderline narcolepsy. - Yeah, I'm starting to think maybe this wasn't such a good idea coming here. - Are you here? ♪ Boom boom, boom, boom ♪ Boom ♪ boom. Uh huh. Hi. What's up? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry Ivan. Okay? I. I care about you. - This isn't something that we can go back into. This isn't anything that you can handle. You're not whoever you-- - No. - I was experimenting with you experimenting, and it didn't work very well for me, so I don't wanna keep that going. - No. - If that's what you're here to propose. - No. - You think you're still hot to me? I don't, you're scary to me. - No. - You're a fucking monster. - No. - No, what? You're like a poet, right? You're like oh I'm here, I'm gonna... This isn't, this was the worst experience of my life. You made me feel like a disgusting piece of garbage, after I fell in love with, I fell in love with you. And you let me. Do you understand that? And you let me, we like spiraled up together. And you made me know, which is true that I'm special. And then you made me feel like I deserve to be murdered. It's, you know what, it's not a, it doesn't, it doesn't, it's fine. Gay rights, I don't know what I mean about gay rights, you know, I'm just saying. Whatever you think you did, that you were just confused, it's all good. I'm okay now. I don't like you. I don't like being around you. You're not a person I care about. - No. No, sorry. I care about you. - Thank you, thanks. - I cared about you. I still care about you. And-- - What are you talking about? - I care about you more than, I care about you. - It's not-- - Ivan. - It's not kinda, it's not something you can have back. You fucked it up. You fucked me. You're an asshole. Your brother.
