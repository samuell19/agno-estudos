Empty your mind. No distraction. No emotion. Only calm and clarity. Yes, Father. The Yoroi Bitsu. Our most sacred chest. The only remaining object of the last Koga Ninja. It is the only final resting place for the weapons of ninja warriors through the ages. The powers they hold are legendary. Each piece with it's own story, handed down from generation to generation for a thousand years. They were created for one purpose only. Sudden and violent death. With these weapons, the ninja became... much more than a mere warrior. He become the most supreme of the lethal disciplines. And used them for profit and wars. It became an art as pure, as it was ruthless. Over the years... The Ninja forged, the deadliest poisons, with only one antidote... They held the power of life, and death. I'll give you anything for the antidote Please, I'll give you anything Please Tradition says... that the Shinobu Katana Sword has the power to take life. But in the hands of a true Koga ninja. He has the power to restore a life's spirit. The Yoroi Bitsu, and it's secrets were pushed from the battlefield, into the imagination. But hidden from sight... safe in this ancient school, a single Yoroi Bitsu survived and the secret of the ninja lived on... transforming the disciplines of death... into Budo... a martial art of enlightenment.

Do you know why I chose you to go? Because I will guard it with my life Hello father, we're here with the professor Yes, and the Yoroi Bitsu is safe Namiko, Just remember, if anything happens I want you to know you're my dearest daughter. Tokyo, Japan Triborough University You see, the Dean is a close personal friend. Considering the safety we need, I thought it wise to store it in the university vault. This way. So tell me, Casey, How does a young man like yourself... - end up in a Japanese Dojo? - You mean a white guy? Well you don't exactly fit the demographic profile. Well, okay. My father was a marine. He was stationed in Okinawa, so me and my mother, moved there with him. But they didn't get along to well. She ended up leaving. The problem was... - She didn't take me with her. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You see, my dad, uh... He was a drunk. I guess she couldn't take it any more, He finally drank himself of the end of a cliff in a car, when I was twelve.. So anyway a friend of the family took me to see Sensei rather than let them ship me off to an orphanage and... that's where I stayed. I haven't looked back since. Masazuka. Everything you know, I taught you But you didn't give me what was rightfully mine. Now I'll take it myself. It will never be yours. You can't be the next Soke. Only one antidote. It's entering your heart. You have only a few minutes. Give me the Yoroi Bitsu. I made a mistake when I created you. Why is that. Fudoshin immovable mind You never learned this. Please accept me. Accept me. I must die so that you can understand. I remember the day I met Takada Sensei in Japan. His technical skills were amazing. Well I hope we can just close the deal. Press is already here.
