Hey! Get back here. The porridge is coming. - Good morning. - Morning. - How are you keeping? - I'm doing well. - But why have you lost weight? - As I said, I'm fine. The teacher wants us to buy exercise books. Study hard. People are saying... - I have to go. - Okay then. We'll speak later. - How are you? - You're late this morning. - Sorry. - See you later. See you. Bye. - How are you? - I'm fine, how are you? Yes, I thank God I'm fine. How is the farming? Not good, as you can see the sun is shining. Look Pili, my wife has cooked too many mandazi. - Please take one. - No thank you. I'm fine. Really there is no problem, take one. Have one. I wanted to say... If you have any problems or worries, come and see me. Okay, thanks. Mahela, how are you sir? - I didn't see you this morning. - My child's uniform was dirty I had to wash it. Why do you listen to English voices? I like it. I am trying to learn. You'll get there. Thank you. - Where is Abdul? - He has typhoid. This isn't enough. That's the amount for the work you have done. - I have worked most of the week. - That's what you're getting. - Give her what she's owed. - This does not concern you. - Mind your own business. - She's my friend. So it is my business. I don't care if she's your friend. I've told you this doesn't concern you, mind your own business. Do you think we can't read? It is written here. I didn't see it. I will give it to her. Let me tell you Pili, our neighbour was caught yesterday climbing out of a window. - Really, whose house? - Amina's. Really? I like that story. - Ok then, tell me more. - Can you believe that woman? - How are you? - Very good, how are you? Okay, okay. So he came out in his underpants. In his underpants! - Really? - From the window. - So, who was he? - It's that Athumani. Athumani? - It's a good year for him. - Yeah! - How's work? - It's ok. Stay for some food? No thank you. I don't have time. - Did you break my door this morning? - No. - Who was it? - I was at my uncle's. Are you lying? Find out who it was. They need to fix it. - Yes. - Okay? What were you doing there? Don't go near there. Mum, why aren't we listening to music? You need to learn, it's important. But we are taught English at school. Finish your homework and you can listen to music. Look Mum, I've finished it. Give me your hands. Morning, Pili. Why isn't Rehema's kiosk open? Her father died. She's gone to Dar es Salaam. - How long will she stay there? - She'll be there for a long time. Otherwise someone would be running it for her. Pili! What are you doing, let's go. - Hello. - Pili, it's me Mahela. I'm calling because one of my kiosks is empty. I have a list of people waiting, but I know you've been saving in order to get a kiosk, so I thought I should call you first. So, do you want it? - Yes, I am very interested. - Okay, good. I will need a deposit tomorrow, it will be 45 000 shillings. - I can't tomorrow, I have a funeral. - Sorry about your loss. The day after tomorrow then. But make sure you bring it or I will start to lose money. - The day after tomorrow. - Okay. Have a good day. Thank you for thinking of me, I appreciate it. You're welcome. - How have you been? - I'm fine. - Say hello to me then! - You seem happy. It's a good day, that's all. Does the Vikoba committee meet tonight? Yes, it's every Tuesday. You're a good friend to me. - Welcome. - Sorry to interrupt. - This is a meeting for group leaders. - I know, this is why I've come. - Let her join us? - She can. Have a seat. I've come to ask a favour. I've been contributing to the pot for several months and I need an advance. You haven't paid in for the last two months. I didn't know that. But I need money to secure a kiosk. Do you know woman, you haven't contributed in two months. If I look at the books, your name isn't there. - So I can't give you a loan. - We should help her? Help her? Help her? Why should I help just because you know her? The rules of Vikoba state that you must save every month. - She used to work at my farm. - Please, it's an emergency. Listen, I've already told you it's impossible. The rules are very clear. Put together a business plan once you have your plan and application form, you bring them here. That is the Vikoba procedure. Can I bring them tomorrow and get the money? No, this is impossible. Maybe after two weeks. Help me Leila, I'm relying on this loan. You're in a rush to get this money but you are forgetting your lack of payments. You can trust her, she used to work for me. Do you understand me? She's not in the books. It's not possible. Okay. You're welcome here again Pili, you're welcome. Ibrahim, cover your sister with a blanket. That's three thousand shillings. Pili. Do you think they will agree? I don't know, but I will try. Do what you can to get them to meet and accept my business plan. I'll try hard to talk to them but I doubt that they will agree. Thank you my friend. I appreciate your help. How have you been lately? I haven't seen you. I'm doing well, but I am very tired. - How about you? - I am well. Ever since my diagnosis I've been taking ARVs. I take them regularly, all the pain is gone. I find myself feeling normal again. How did you cope? In my community the people were ignorant, so I educated them, educated them. I set up a group for women affected by HIV. We meet every Monday. We talk about issues affecting us. I realised I wasn't the only one there were others like me. But we are always looking for new members. I will call you tomorrow morning to see if you have spoken to the women. Wake up, let's go. Stay back. Where's my girl gone? Where is she? This is Cecilia, I can't come to the phone. Please leave a message. - How are you, Abdul? - I'm fine, you? I heard you were ill, how are you feeling? - I'm feeling much better now. - Good. - Abdul. - Yes? I would like to borrow 20 000 shillings. Pili, that is a lot of money. I am trying to start a business so I can pay you back with interest. I trust you Pili, but I can only pay what you have worked. Thank you, Abdul. - Mahela. - Hello Pili, how are you? - Fine. - Do you have the deposit? I'll bring... - I'll bring the money tonight. - Tonight? Today will be better. I know, I'm sorry. Tonight is the earliest I can do. This is not ideal, Pili. Fine. See you later. - Who is that? - Mr. Mahela. - What is he saying? - He called about our agreement. - What agreement? - He has offered me the empty kiosk. - What do you want to sell? - I want to sell beauty products. Can you handle it? I've heard the old man likes things done in a rush. See the way he's rushing you, about your agreement. That's true but I have no choice. I need to convince the Vikoba members to give me an advance, so that I can set up the business. You know what it's like working in the fields, digging all day and always fighting. - I can't do this my whole life. - You're right, farming is hard. If you can get a kiosk like that, great. I've been trying to reach you all morning. Did you get hold of the Vikoba women? I tried but I couldn't get through. And now I've run out of credit. - Okay, use my phone to get Leila. - I will try, wait here. Hello Leila. Can we have another meeting tonight? At the Vikoba. Please come. Come on. Within an hour. Okay then. I will wait for you there. Okay. She says she will come within the hour. Thank you so much. See you in a bit. You are late. Sorry, can you keep her for another hour? No. I'm only asking for one more hour. I'm not doing that, you owe me money. I also have a family to feed, I depend on this. - Please just one hour. - No. Where were you? I've been sent home from school until we buy another textbook. Go inside. - I'll pay them tomorrow. Go inside. - I'm hungry. I'll cook for you when I come back. Keep the door closed and do your homework. You brought the business plan but no application form. I didn't know but I can fix it. That is the procedure, the problem is you didn't bring three photos, the name of the chairman, the secretary and the address. Okay, I'll do that soon as I leave here. But for now, accept my paperwork. That's not possible. - I'm begging. - Not possible. - Please accept my paperwork. - You have not followed the procedure. The rules state we have to vote. Votes for accepting Pili's paperwork? We accept. Thank you very much. Come back in a week to collect the money. - Please, I need that money tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes, I need it tomorrow. - Tomorrow! Pili, this is the procedure. You wait one week and you'll get the money. But the money is here in the office, isn't it? You don't tell us how we give out the money. Our procedure here is one week. I've been the chairlady for five years. It is not possible to change rules which we've had for five years. The schedule states one week. We are all agreed on this. - Please, I need the money tomorrow. - Next week the loan is worthless. Why should we change the rules for you? I had to wait one week for mine. Nobody has their paperwork accepted one day, and gets the loan the next day. Wait please, wait! Please don't go. I've been saving for the last five years, so that I can start a business. I never thought I'd get an opportunity like this. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Please understand. I've been working the fields by myself without help from anyone. Please, I am tired. You are not the only one who has been left. We've all had to raise children alone. Do you understand me. It is not you alone. I know my situation is not special, there are many like me. But I want something better for my children, a better life. This is my only chance. Tomorrow it will be gone. Please, I ask that you help me. I ask that you understand. We could talk to other members? I don't know if they will agree. Thank you. Eat, eat. I'm waiting. Are you coming? I won't make it today. My child is sick. This is not good. The kiosk is empty. I'm losing money. I wanted to ask if I could pay half this week and half next week. You said you have the money. What are you saying now? I have it, but I prefer to give you half this week and the rest the next week. I thought you were serious about doing business that's why I chose you over others. Do you think I'm a bank? I'm sorry, please just give me one more day. I'm not a rich man, Pili. Please, Mr. Mahela. I'll give you all your money tomorrow. Tomorrow. - Hey, where did you find that? - In your room. What are ARVs? - They are vitamins. - Are you sick? I'm not sick, my son. One day I'll be a doctor and if you get sick, I'll treat you. - Thank you, my son. - Okay. Drink your porridge. - Good morning. - Morning. I hear you are getting the empty kiosk? I'm trying. My neighbour has been asking about it for months. He had agreed to give it to her. But actually you're the one he's chosen. You and Mahela must be good friends. Yes, he is a kind man. You should know the whole village is talking about you. Let them talk, that's what they usually do. Fine! I'm happy for you, my friend. I know it's been hard since Kafil left. But now your life could change. Have you heard from Kafil? No. Ibrahim. Take this money to your teacher. Go and study, my son. Do you hear me? You are still young. You can easily find another husband. But I am too old. I've got so many grey hairs. You see? I will never get a man now but I would love to have one. I'm late for work, I need to get to the farm. - My legs are aching. - Too much walking and gossiping. - What was that? - Nothing. - Okay, bye. - See you later. Cecilia is not available right now. Please leave a message. I hope the rains will come. - Why are you so quiet, Pili? - Am I? Are you okay? Did you speak to Ana about the kiosk? I did speak to her. I wish you hadn't. Why is that? You are very secretive nowadays, Pili. These days you don't tell me your secrets. Yet I am your closest friend. If you talk to me, maybe I can help you. Don't worry, when the time is right I'll tell you. Ok then, I would like that. Wake up, Pili. Pili, wake up. - Are you okay? - Maybe she's hungry. - Was she working hard in the hot sun? - Yes, she hasn't even drunk water. She's waking up. Let me get her some water. Yes, she's awake. - Hey Pili, how are you feeling? - I am okay. - I'm sorry. Are you okay? - Here have some water. I'm sorry, Pili. Let's take her to the traditional doctor. He might be able to help. No. Let's take her to the village doctor, he's better. - No, let's take her to Ayub. - Let's take her to Kangugo. Pili how are you feeling? What happened? I'm fine. - Steady, Pili! - What just happened? Are you okay? Go home and rest. No, I need to work. How are you going to work when you can't even stand up? - I can work. - You can't. I'll pay you for the whole day. Go home and rest. Okay? Okay. The number you are trying to call cannot be reached. Please try later. - I haven't seen you for a long time. - I've been very busy. - What can I do for you? - I've run out of ARVs. - How long have you been without them? - For about a month now. - And Septrin? - Septrin also about one month. Wait a minute. The price has gone up. 15 000 shillings. What! 15 000 shillings. - My friend, why is the price so high? - That is the price, my friend. I cannot help you. My friend, please help me. I cannot help you, my sister just died now I have two more kids to feed. I have been coming to you for long time. This is not my first visit. I know this is not your first time but the price has changed. Please my friend, this is the last time. I won't come back. - I'm asking you give me one week. - Today is clinic day. You can go to the clinic where the medicine is free. Why would you talk about the clinic when I have come here? This is how it is. The price has gone up. Today is clinic day. If you can't afford the price go to the clinic where it is free. Or are you scared people will see you? Never mind. Pili! - What are you doing here? - I have stomach ache. Today is CTC day. The doctor is only seeing those patients. - The CTC is today? - It's today. - I didn't know. See you later. - I'll walk with you. The kiosk is still sitting empty. Yes, I told you, I'm trying. Mahela must really like you to wait this long. - He has kept it just for you! - Stop meddling in my life. Everyday you are nosing around, I don't like it. That's all well and good but I'm just trying to help you. I am telling you if I have a problem, I'll come to you. And if I don't, then mind your own business! Oh dear, this one! Hey! Cecilia is not available right now... - How are you? - I'm fine. How can I help? I've come for ARVs. I have run out. - What is your name? - Pili Hussein. - Have you been here before? - No. - Where do you live? - Miono. Isn't there a CTC in Miono? Normally I would have sent you home. But I will help you. - You can see a doctor. - Thank you. When were you diagnosed? During my second pregnancy two years ago. - Is the child also positive? - No she's negative. I took Nevirapine. Have you been taking your ARVs regularly? - Not for a while. - Why not? This is very important. I've been very busy. They ran out and I couldn't get more. There is a CTC clinic in your village, why aren't you going there? It's far from my home, I can't go every month. There are many women with HIV they normally take the free bus to the clinic together. Breathe in, please. Breathe. And what about Septrin? Are you using it? I can't afford it. You need to take care of your health. Does your family know about your status? My family lives in Arusha, I came here to my husband's village. Where is your husband? - He left. - When did he leave? When I told him I was positive. - Is he also positive? - He refused to be tested. - What about your husband's family? - I don't need their help. Do they know about your status? When was the last time you had a CD4 test? - I don't remember. - You need the test urgently. Our machine is broken but there is one in Bagamoyo. I can get you an appointment this afternoon. It won't take too long, the bus takes one hour and you will be seen straightaway. I will pay for your fare. I can't, I have something important to do today. There is nothing more important than your health. Who will take care of your two kids when you fall ill? Sorry I can't go today, I will come back another day. Pili, this cannot wait! - Pili. - Cecilia! I'm worn out? I've been trying to get hold of you, how are things? I have spoken to many members? The Vikoba women have agreed t o meet tonight at seven. Thank you. Do you think they will allow me to get the money tonight? I will call them and try to convince them. I'll see you there. Thank you very much. Call Bagamoyo, tell them I will come. - Excuse me, where is the hospital? - It's over there, along the beach. That way? Okay, thank you. Take a bike! This one is leaving! I have an appointment with Doctor Omari. - What is your name? - Pili Hussein. I don't see your name. My doctor called an hour ago and arranged it with him. He is busy now. - When will he be free? - I don't know. Live positively. Fight Stigma, do not isolate yourself because of HIV. Where is the Doctor? Nurse, call for Doctor Omari. - How long will he be? - How should I know? Sikujua it's me, Pili. Ibrahim will be back from school, stay with him. Pili Hussein. I can see you now. I have to go. You'll be lucky to get another appointment. Your results are ready, follow me. Your CD4 count is very low, it shows 380. Do you know what that means? No. A healthy person has a CD4 count of 500-1200 millimetres. But under 200 can mean you have progressed into the third level of HIV infection, AIDS. Is that what I have? No, but this is very serious. If you start taking ARVs regularly, there is no reason you can't get back to normal. I'm going to give you Septrin I will check your count again in one month, and here are some condoms, you must not have unprotected sex at the moment, it will be very risky for your partner. I am alone. Take these leaflets, so that you and your family can learn more. Have you told your family? Sorry, I am needed in Miono. - Thank you. - Please, think about what I said. - How much to the bus station? - Two thousand. Two thousand? - Do I look like a tourist? - No that's our price. I have one thousand here, take it or leave it. Okay, let's go. Hello? It's Pili, have you seen Cecilia? If you see her, tell her to call me. It's very important. Okay. - Going to Miono? - Yes, we are. - Hi Cecilia. - Pili, where are you? I've been calling, I couldn't reach you. I've been very busy. Get the women to wait. - I'll try. - Tell them I'm coming. - Come quickly. - Right now, right now, I'm coming. The women cannot wait much longer. Wait! Please... Sorry I'm late. My bus broke down. - It was hard but I got here. - We've been waiting, now it's too late. I'm sorry, I had to take two buses to get here, it wasn't easy. Please reconsider. We've already closed the office, you have to come back next week. I've tried really hard to get here, please don't send me away. We're all here, let's do what we came to do. This is obviously not important to you. Nothing is more important. That's why I am here right now. Then how can you leave us waiting like this? I went to Bagamoyo for a CD4 test. I am sick. I've been hiding for a long time. I didn't want anyone to find out. But I see now, it's all been for nothing. Now you know. What is the point of all this? Pili! Members, we met here yesterday and the day before. Pili wanted the loan earlier and we refused. Today we meet again to vote, who agrees that Pili should be given the money now? And how many vote against? Okay. The votes are evenly split. As the chairlady, I have the deciding vote. Pili can have the money. Her contributions are unreliable, first they refuse... Thank you very much, chairlady. Pili's getting the money! I am the chairlady. Pili's getting the money! This is my decision. Pili gets the money. But, you will pay back the loan sooner and your interest will be higher, because all of us here are struggling. Yes. We won't do this again, we will not bend the rules. Are we agreed? Pili, come the office and get your money. Don't worry my friend Pili, you are not alone. Sorry I'm late. I've been waiting, you're very late. Ibrahim broke my mirror. Hey! Why did you do that? Why did you break her mirror? Sorry, I'll pay you for it. Could you keep them a little bit longer? - No, I need to go to my sister's. - Please stay with her for half an hour. - I'm already late for my sister! - Please, I am begging. Ibrahim, I have to go out for a bit. I don't want you to go. You're never here. Yes my son I know, but you have to stay with your sister. Look after your sister, don't let her go outside. The door is broken. Don't let her anywhere near it. I am here I have your money. I have been calling you all day and I haven't been able to reach you. I know but I left my phone at home. I have your money. - You are too late. - But why? I was tired of waiting for you so I gave it to someone else. No you can't do that to me. Here's your money. I have it here, please. You are too late. Let's talk about this. I have the money right here. I am begging you that we talk. Please Mahela. Come inside. Have a seat. - Would you like something to drink? - No, I am fine. Excuse the mess, my wife is away in Dar es Salaam. Sorry. My problem is this, I'm a good man. I wanted to help you but you did not do as we had agreed. I understand. I've done all I can. I have your money. It's a question of trust. It's not that easy. I don't know if I can trust you again. You can trust me. That is easy to say. Please Mahela, give me a chance. I have your money. My dream is to run a business. People say I'm a fool. I am too good to people, maybe they are right. You're a good person, Mahela. I tried to help you. But you... you did not help me. Maybe you could try again, to help me believe that you can help me so that I can trust you again. So... Are you ready to help me? I don't know what you mean. Pili, how many children do you have? I have two children. Those two children, how did you get them? Did you buy them? Were they delivered? Or did they fall from the sky? Pili, we are adults. - You have a wife. - And you have a husband. But neither of them are here. No, this is not the agreement The agreement was I give you the deposit, and nothing else. The choice is yours. You are free to go. I get the kiosk and I keep half the deposit and we use protection. You are a businesswoman after all. As you have asked, you keep half the deposit. But on the issue of using protection, that is not part of our agreement. What is that medicine for? This is Septrin. I take it with my ARVs. It keeps my immune system strong. - How long do you have to take them? - I will take them my whole life. When I am a doctor I will make you healthy. Ibrahim, I am already healthy, you can see that my son. Ana... Come and have a tea? - How are your legs these days? - Hello! You'll never believe it. Now my legs are totally fine! Juma Nasolo the healer, cured me. I used to walk like this... Just like that. He did such a great job, you know that type of traditional healing, the healing from the past, look at me now! I'm great! I have no problems! Now I'm shaking my ass! Just like that! Look at my body. I'm flawless! - How are you Pili? - I'm fine, how are you? I see you have some nice stuff. Yes, Monte Clare, there is Ayub, there is Cocoa butter, there is Softie. What about this one? - I'll give you a discount on this one. - It's very nice. That's very nice. It makes the skin very soft. Here you go. This lotion is good, not like the usual ones. During this cold period, it is really good. Here you go. - There you go, my friend. - Okay. See you.
