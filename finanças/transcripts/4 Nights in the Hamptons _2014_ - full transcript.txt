HE WASN'T LYING. HE ALSO SAID YOU WERE A PRETTY GOOD ACTOR, TOO. I BELIEVE HIM. SO, ARE YOU STILL WRITING? - UH, NO, NOT REALLY. I GUESS I GOT SOME STORIES ROLLING AROUND IN MY HEAD, BUT, UH, I THINK MOST WRITERS ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING GOING ON UP THERE. - WHY AREN'T YOU WRITING THEM? - UH, PEOPLE WEREN'T TOO INTERESTED IN WHAT I WAS WRITING. IT GETS PRETTY TIRING BARING YOUR SOUL AND PEOPLE JUST AREN'T GETTING IT. BESIDES, I DON'T THINK I NEEDED TO SO MUCH. I WAS YOUNG, HAD A LOT OF CONFUSION, THINGS TO WORK OUT. IT'S, UH, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WRITING IS GOOD FOR. - SO NOW YOU GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT? - MAYBE. - WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD FILL ME IN ON SOME OF THE MYSTERIES OF LIFE, THEN. - SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU ALREADY GOT SOME THINGS FIGURED OUT AS WELL. - MAYBE, BUT NOT EVERYTHING. - IT GETS BORING ONCE YOU DO. - OH.

I NEVER TOLD YOU? - NO, I DON'T THINK SO. - WELL, WE GOT TO HAVE SOME SECRETS, DON'T WE? - I WAS-- I DON'T THINK IT EVER CAME UP. FUNNY. IT WAS SO LONG AGO. - I GUESS CATHERINE'S A BAD INFLUENCE ON YOU, EH? WHATEVER HAPPENED TO YOU SMOKING CIGARS? THAT WAS A REGULAR THING WITH YOU, WASN'T IT? - YEAH, IT WAS. BUT I WAS ENCOURAGED TO QUIT. BUT I CAN SEE THE RULES ARE CHANGING NOW. - I NEVER TOLD YOU TO QUIT. - SUBTLE ENCOURAGEMENTS. - I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. - YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT, RIGHT? - YEAH, BUT-- - SO I QUIT. I DON'T HAVE AN ADDICTIVE PERSONALITY. - THAT IS TRUE. YOU NEVER DID GET HUNG UP ON MUCH. SELF-DISCIPLINE? - I DON'T KNOW. I THINK IT'S MORE ABOUT HARD-WIRING. - I FIGURED IT WAS ALL THAT BUDDHIST STUFF YOU READ. - YOU'RE A BUDDHIST? - NO, I JUST READ SOME STUFF. - AH. SEEKING ANSWERS. - I GUESS. - FIND ANY? - JUST MORE QUESTIONS. - YOU ARE A DEEP MAN. - FUNNY. - AM I? - I NEVER TOLD YOU TO QUIT. - I GUESS IT WAS MISCOMMUNICATION. - I GUESS SO. WHAT ELSE? - WHAT ELSE WHAT? - ARE THERE OTHER THINGS YOU FEEL I'VE ASKED YOU TO CHANGE? - I WAS JUST PLAYING. IF I DIDN'T WANT TO QUIT, I WOULDN'T HAVE QUIT. - I NEVER WANTED YOU TO CHANGE. I HOPE I HAVEN'T SAID THINGS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE HAD TO. - YOU THINK I'VE CHANGED? I MEAN BESIDES BECOMING OLD AND UNAGGRESSIVE. - I DIDN'T MEAN THAT THE WAY IT SOUNDED. - YEAH, IT SOUNDED PRETTY SINCERE. - DAVID. THIS IS FUN. AREN'T YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME? - YEAH, I AM. - WHAT'S WRONG? YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE THINKING. I THOUGHT YOU SAID THINKING WASN'T GOOD FOR YOU. - YEAH, WELL, MAYBE SOMETIMES IT IS. - WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT? COME ON, WHAT IS IT? - HAS HE SAID ANYTHING TO YOU? - MARC? ABOUT WHAT? - I DON'T KNOW, ANYTHING. - (SIGHS) WOULD YOU JUST RELAX AND HAVE FUN? SHE'S SWEET. OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE IN LOVE. MAYBE HE JUST WANTED TO SHOW OFF HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND, MAKE YOU JEALOUS. - MAKE ME JEALOUS? PLEASE. - WHAT? - I THINK HE STILL HAS A CRUSH ON YOU. - ME? - YEAH. WHY DO YOU THINK HE TOOK OFF FOR L.A.? I KNOW IT BOTHERED HIM WHEN WE STARTED DATING. - UM, YOU REALLY THINK IT WAS ME HE HAD A CRUSH ON? - YEAH. WHY? HEY, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? - I... I JUST DON'T THINK HE HAD A CRUSH ON ME, THAT'S ALL. YOU TWO WERE BEST FRIENDS, AND I COME ALONG AND STEAL YOU AWAY. - YOU DIDN'T STEAL ME AWAY. - YEAH. YEAH, I DID. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - LET'S STOP SOMEWHERE ON THE WAY BACK AND GETS SOME NICE CIGARS. I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY. - I AM. - GOOD. (PLANE FLYING OVERHEAD) - IT'S SO PEACEFUL OUT HERE. I CAN SEE WHY YOU GUYS LIKE IT SO MUCH. IF I LIVED OUT HERE, I WOULD NEVER LEAVE. - (LAUGHING) - DID YOU COME OUT HERE WHEN YOU WERE A KID, TOO? - YEAH. IT WASN'T SO PEACEFUL THEN. MY FATHER WAS A... WELL, FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD, A RAGE-A-HOLIC. WE WERE ALWAYS WALKING ON EGGSHELLS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MY MOTHER PUT UP WITH HIM AS LONG AS SHE DID. - WHAT WAS HE RAGING ABOUT? - I DON'T KNOW. I NEVER UNDERSTOOD HIM. NEVER REALLY GOT TO KNOW HIM. I'LL HAVE TO TRY WHAT YOU SAID. REMEMBER THINGS THE WAY I WANT TO REMEMBER THEM. - (LAUGHING) MIGHT AS WELL, RIGHT? - YEAH, SELF-DECEPTION. THAT WORKS. - THINK SO? - DON'T YOU? - HE DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT. - BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. WE REMEMBER THINGS THE WAY WE WANT TO REMEMBER THEM. MIGHT AS WELL FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE THINGS, RIGHT? WHY GET ALL BOGGED DOWN WITH THE NEGATIVE STUFF? - WELL, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT OTHER STUFF DIDN'T HAPPEN. - THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING. - BUT MAYBE OUR PERCEPTION ISN'T ALWAYS ACCURATE. - HOW DO YOU MEAN? - LIKE, THE OTHER DAY, WHEN I WAS IN-- WHEN I WAS IN TOWN SEEING MICHAEL, HE WAS SAYING THINGS THAT I THOUGHT WERE OUT OF FOCUS. - HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU REMEMBER WAS IN FOCUS? - I DON'T. (LAUGHING) I MEAN, I GUESS I QUESTION IT EVERY SO OFTEN, YOU KNOW? JUST SLOW DOWN AND FEEL IT. OR QUESTION IT. BUT I DON'T THINK MICHAEL EVER DID. HE WAS ALWAYS SO SET ON WHAT WAS RIGHT AND WHAT WAS WRONG, AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. I DON'T CARE WHAT'S RIGHT OR WRONG. I CAN GIVE A FUCK. BUT HE JUST COULDN'T LET IT GO. HE JUST ALWAYS WANTED TO DEBATE SOMETHING THAT I WAS DOING. (CHUCKLING) WHO CAN LIVE LIKE THAT? - WELL, I GUESS HE CAN. - YEAH. - YOU WANT TO GO FOR A WALK ON THE BEACH? - SURE. - YOU GUYS WANT TO GO FOR A WALK ON THE BEACH? - I'LL PASS. - JULES? - TOO TIRED. - COME ON.

DID MARC ASK YOU TO WRITE SOMETHING? - NO. HE ASKED IF I HAD BEEN WRITING, WHICH MADE ME THINK. THEN I REALIZED I HAVEN'T WRITTEN ANYTHING IN QUITE A WHILE. - I GUESS MARC BEING HERE HAS SOME GOOD POINTS TOO, HUH? SO, WHAT ARE YOU WRITING ABOUT? IS SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU? YOU GONNA WORK OUT SOME ANGST? - MAYBE. - MAYBE? - YEAH. MAYBE THAT'S WHY I'M WRITING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - NOTHING. - REALLY? WELL, IT SURE DOES SEEM LIKE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING. - BUT I'M NOT. REMEMBER? THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS AS THEY APPEAR TO BE. - OH. WHO SAID THAT? - ME. JUST NOW. SO WHY ARE YOU WRITING? - OOH. HA HA. TO LEARN. - TO LEARN? - YEAH. I GUESS THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON-- OH-- I NEED TO UNDERSTAND. - SOMETHING'S GOING ON? - OH, YEAH. YES, DEFINITELY. - YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT? - UH-HUH. (EXHALES) - THAT'S GOOD. - YEAH, IT IS. - WHAT IS, UM, MARC'S PHILOSOPHY? - WHAT? - THE OTHER DAY WHEN YOU WERE PLAYING TENNIS, ABOUT KEEPING SCORE. - (MOANING) UH, UH... - WHAT? WHAT IS IT? TELL ME. - I CAN'T. I CAN'T THINK RIGHT NOW. - WHAT'S WRONG? YOU WANT ME TO STOP? - NO, NO, PLEASE DON'T. PLEASE DON'T. OHH. - COME ON, WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY? - OH. OH, GOD, I CAN'T. OHH. I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT MARC RIGHT NOW. - WHY NOT? - (MOANING) OH, YEAH, YEAH. OH. OH, GOD. OHH! OH, GOD. OH. OH. (MOANING) WHEW. (LAUGHING) OH. OH. OH. HE, UH... HE THINKS THAT, UH... THE NEED TO KEEP SCORE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO, UM, DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE ALL ONE. COMPLETELY CONNECTED. THERE IS NO YOU OR ME. THAT THE NEED TO DOMINATE AND WIN IS, UH, AN EGO THING. AND IF YOU TRANSCEND THE EGO, YOU WILL SEE THERE IS NO WINNING OR LOSING. THERE IS JUST WHAT THERE IS. - I DIDN'T KNOW MARC WAS SO DEEP. - HMM. - AND WHAT DO YOU THINK? - I DON'T KNOW. I KIND OF LIKE THE GAME OF DOMINANCE AND SUBMISSION. (SPLASHING) - OH! HA HA! (LAUGHING) (SPLASHING) OH! (COUGHING) (LAUGHING) OH! - GOOD MORROW! - GOOD MORROW. - (LAUGHING) YOU UP FOR A LITTLE RUN WITH ME TODAY? - MM-MMM. - YOU DID SAY SOMETHING ABOUT GETTING RID OF THAT, DID YOU NOT? - OH, FUNNY. - SMELLS GOOD. GOOD MORNING. - ARE WE BEING RUDE? I'M SORRY. - NO. GO. I WAS JUST TRYING TO CONVINCE DAVID TO GO FOR A LITTLE RUN. - OH. I'VE TRIED, TOO, BUT-- - WHAT? WAIT, GET OUT OF HERE. - CATHERINE STILL SLEEPING? - NO, NO, SHE'S AN EARLY RISER. SHE IS DOING YOGA ON YOUR BACK LAWN. - REALLY? - YEAH. PRETTY MUCH EVERY MORNING. - WOW. - OKAY, LET'S DO IT. - YEAH? - WOW. - WHAT? I'LL GO THROW SOME SNEAKERS ON. YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IT EASY ON ME, THOUGH, RIGHT? - YEAH. - GOOD JOB. - LOOKS LIKE I GOT A RUNNING PARTNER. - VERY GOOD. MORNING. - AM I INTERRUPTING? - OH, NO. NOT AT ALL. - PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. - SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME WHEN I FIRST STARTED. IT'S JUST PRACTICE, YOU KNOW? PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT. MY MOTHER USED TO ALWAYS SAY THAT. JUST LIKE THAT, TOO. (LAUGHING) I GUESS IT WORKED. - LOOKS LIKE IT. - YOU EVER TRY? YOGA? - OH, NO. WELL, ACTUALLY, ONCE. WE WERE IN THE BAHAMAS AT THIS RESORT-TYPE PLACE, AND IT WAS MAINLY COUPLES. THEY HAD THIS BEGINNERS' CLASS. FIRST THING IN THE MORNING ON THE BEACH. SOUNDED SO NICE, I THOUGHT, WHY NOT, YOU KNOW? WAS GONNA CHANGE MY LIFE. I THOUGHT, I'M GONNA BE A YOGA PERSON. FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, I WILL DO YOGA. (CHUCKLES) I WAS GONNA BE HEALTHY. I WAS EVEN PICTURING ALL THE BLENDED JUICE DRINKS I WOULD HAVE EVERY DAY, YOU KNOW, ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. BUT I TRIED. I MEAN, I KIND OF TRIED. SOMETHING DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT. I PRETENDED SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH MY STOMACH, AND I EXCUSED MYSELF. THINK I LASTED, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES. THE INSTRUCTOR IN THOSE PLACES, THEY DON'T REALLY CARE. I'M SURE SHE THOUGHT, "OH, GOOD, ANOTHER BEGINNER I DON'T HAVE TO HELP," YOU KNOW? - COME HERE. YOU WANNA TRY? I'LL HELP YOU. - UH, THAT'S OKAY. - BETTER DO IT NOW. IT NOT GONNA GET ANY EASIER. - THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF. - COME ON. - OKAY. - FEELS GOOD, DOESN'T IT? - IF I COULD CATCH MY BREATH, YEAH. - OH, COME ON. YOU'RE DOING FINE. - OH. NO, REALLY.

I JUST RAN A MARATHON A COUPLE YEARS AGO. - THAT WAS, LIKE, SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO, WASN'T IT? - WHAT? YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT? - YOU FEEL THAT? NOW TAKE A DEEP BREATH. - (INHALES) - AND EXHALE. - (EXHALES) WOW. OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS FEELS. - HOW YOU FEELING? - LIKE SHIT. CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. - WHY DO YOU RESIST THINGS? I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE HAS TO BE ALL THIS TENSION BETWEEN US. DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN THINGS WERE RELAXED? I DON'T BLAME YOU, YOU KNOW. JULIE'S A GREAT CATCH. IF SHE'D HAVE PICKED ME, I WOULD HAVE DONE-- - PICKED YOU? - YEAH. WHY NOT? EVERYTHING COULD BE DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW. EVERYTHING COULD STILL BE DIFFERENT. THERE'S NOTHING ETCHED IN STONE. THE SIMPLEST OF THINGS CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING, RIGHT? THOSE ARE YOUR WORDS. DID YOU FORGET THAT EVERYTHING IS SO FRAGILE? I GUESS YOU DID FORGET. - THAT WAS YEARS AGO. - SO WHAT'S CHANGED? - WHAT'S CHANGED? - YEAH, WHAT'S CHANGED? - I'M MARRIED. - JEEZ, LIKE THAT FUCKING MEANS ANYTHING. - YOU'RE A FUCKING ASSHOLE. - THAT'S THE BEST YOU GOT, HUH? I'M AN ASSHOLE? OKAY, YEAH, I'M AN ASSHOLE. SO WHAT? WHO FUCKING CARES? DID YOU HEAR THAT, OCEAN? I'M AN ASSHOLE! DAVID THINKS I'M AN ASSHOLE.

I'M GOING TO CHECK ON JULIE, AND THEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT POPPING INTO TOWN AND GETTING SOME STUFF TO MAKE US BRUNCH. - SOUNDS GREAT. IF I SEE MARC, I'LL TELL HIM. MAYBE HE'LL WANT TO TAKE A RIDE WITH YOU. - OKAY. - AAH! YOU SCARED ME. - SORRY. - THAT'S OKAY. - MIND IF I JOIN YOU? - NO. SURE. - CATHERINE SAID YOU WANTED TO SHOW HER SOMETHING? - UH, NO. IT WAS NOTHING. - WHAT'S THE MATTER? - NOTHING. I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE MAD. - WHAT FOR? - SOMETHING HAPPENED. - THAT WAS SO GOOD, JULIE. WHAT DID YOU PUT ON THAT? - NOTHING SPECIAL. COULD I? - OH. YEAH. SORRY. SO RUDE. - SALT, PEPPER. OH, SOME SPICY MUSTARD. - THAT'S-THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. MUSTARD, SPICY, DELICIOUS. - THANK YOU.

I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW, THOUGH, RIGHT? - YEAH, I GUESS. DO YOU REALLY WONDER WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF SHE HAD PICKED YOU? - YEAH, SOMETIMES. BUT NOT AS MUCH AS IF... YOU PICKED ME. - JULIE COULDN'T HAVE HANDLED IT. - SO YOU DID ALL THIS FOR JULIE, THEN, HUH? YEAH. TOWNHOUSE IN THE CITY, BEACHFRONT ESTATE. YEAH. THE SACRIFICES WE MAKE FOR LOVE, HUH? THE BOAT IS THE CLINCHER, THOUGH. THAT'S REALLY NICE. LOOK... I DON'T BLAME YOU. ANY ONE OF US WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING. IT'S NICE NOT TO BE SO AMBITIOUS. IT LETS YOU RECOGNIZE A REALLY GOOD THING WHEN IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE. - WHY DO YOU ALWAYS TRY TO MAKE THINGS BAD? CATHERINE'S A GOOD GIRL. BUT YOU ALWAYS WANT MORE. WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE HAPPY? - IT'S NOT TRUE, I AM HAPPY. - YOU'RE HAPPY? - I'M HAPPY. (PASSIONATE MOANING) - YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. OH, WAIT A MINUTE. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. JULES.
