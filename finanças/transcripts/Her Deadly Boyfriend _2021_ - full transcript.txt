Miss librarian.' aren't you past your legal book limit? Wanted to get ahead on the extra credit for AP history. The one due next month? Ugh, thank god we're friends because if not, I would hate you. Uhh, excuse us. You're excused. Move, jock. Or what, huh? Or I will move you. Stop, that's cheating. [school bell ringing] Gavin Barrett, where do you think you're going? I've got responsibilities, ms. Parker. Yes, like class. Last I checked chem 2 wasn't putting food on the table, so.. Walk past the gate, you're truant. I've been called worse, ms. Parker. [music on stereo] [chuckling] [chuckling] hey fish, what's up? You like math? No? Yeah, calculus blows. (Sadie) seriously? I am not gonna finish any faster with you... I know, I know. - I'm the worst. - No. I just want you to be as quiet as a fish. (Taryn) hey, you two. - Hi, mom. - Hey, Taryn. Hi, jack. - Did you check the mail? - No, I forgot. [Taryn chuckles] well, open it! But what if I didn't get in? Then you and I will take a year off and will travel around India together. So much for being a tiger mom. Okay. I'm gonna get in. Then you'll be at Harvard, and I'll be at bu. Twelve minutes away, just like we planned. Okay. "dear ms. Miller," blah, blah, blah.. Ohh, what is it? I can't take it? - I did it. - Scholarship and all? - I'm in. I'm in. - Oh, my.. [all cheering] I'm so proud of you. You did it. [laughing] ♪ ...Sick of this long drives ♪ ♪ 'cause the road signs are passing too slow ♪ (jack) 'hey, dad.' - 'hi, Mr. McAllister.' - hey, kids. Well, well, well, what a nice surprise. 'no practice today, jack?' we're doing doubles tomorrow, so coach gave us a day off. Okay, well, make sure you don't forget about the photo shoot tomorrow. Alright, your mom and I are expect you there. - I won't. - 'good.' what can I do for you, Sadie? It's called "clean sweep." we're partnering with local businesses to sponsor coastal cleanup parties and if a company like McAllister global communications were to endorse our project it would really give us that boost we need. With your help, we could really expand our reach to businesses, schools and more of the community. Sounds great. Oh, look at that. (Sadie) we'd love to get your support. I mean, if you're interested. Well, I'll tell you what. Um.. Obviously, these things have to be vetted. Um, but I promise to have my office look over it. Thank you so much, sir. It means the world to me. Well, your passion means the world to me. - 'hi, mom.' - 'hey, Taryn.' ah, these need your signatures. Oh. How'd it go? - Bye, you two. - Bye, mom. [instrumental music] oh, my god! I love your dad. Everyone does. He just has a way of making you feel like the most important person in the world. Yeah. Listen, Sadie.. He's not gonna do anything. What do you mean? He said he would submit it to.. - No. - He's not? Trust me, in seventeen years I've seen that face plenty. I just don't want you to get your hopes up. - Hi, Sadie! - Hi. These yours? Yeah, they got away from me, sorry. This is a great program. You work with clean sweep? - Uh, yes. - She started it, mom. I didn't know you two were coming down today. What's the occasion? Sadie's program. They need a corporate sponsor so she presented it to dad. Oh? How'd it go? Well, Mrs. McAllister, I thought it went well, but.. He said he'll consider it. Well, let's consider this.. Why don't you give that number a call, Sadie? I'm half of McAllister and I think your program is very impressive. - Thank you. - Yeah. Okay, I'm late again. Your father wanted me to remind you that we had... I know, I know. Photo shoot, tomorrow. I got it. Thanks, mom. - She's... - Gonna do more than consider. I promise. (Sadie) hey, shell. Do you wanna go to the grove tonight? - I'd love to, but... - Ugh! "I've gotta do homework. I've got to write some essay "worthy of the 'new york times.' I've got to make Michelle puke with my dedication to perfection." it's mostly the puke I'm going for. Come on! Just come! (Sadie) 'I can't! Seriously.' okay, fine.

Right. So, you're buying small countries? [laughs] oh, yeah. Hey, I, uh, I got in. - Full ride. - Harvard? No! Rossmore university. Rossmore? But we have been talking all this time about Harvard. I thought you'd be excited for me. I am. It's just.. We had a plan. Me at bu, you at Harvard, so we'd be in the same city. Harvard was a great plan b, but... - Wait. I'm plan b? - No! Sadie, come on. So much can happen during these years. If it's meant to be, boom! If not, it was our first love. It was special. It was special? Are you kidding me? No, no, no, I-it is special. Is. I mean, why are you getting so hung up on this? You mean what we've been planning and talking about for over two years? Why am I hung up on that? Who knows what we'll become in four years? Yeah, since you've become a jerk in five minutes, I can only imagine what might happen in four years. Sadie. Sadie, you're just gonna leave? - It's over. - 'can we talk about this?'

"it's such an honor and a privilege being your plan b?" - don't do that. - You said that, not me. Yeah, I didn't mean it like that. Exactly. So, were you lying then or are you lying now? - Get off of me. - Sadie, I love you. But I'm not even your plan a, right? [thuds] [upbeat music] [indistinct chatter] remind me why "operation fun" involves my ex's house? Because your ex is the one with the best parties. And plus, you get to show him that you've officially moved on. Can't I move on somewhere else? No. [music continues] okay, look, we both know that jack ends up in the game room with his buddies so let's just avoid the game room. Okay, this is supposed to be fun. So, loosen up.

I have paid for my mistakes and I have done what I needed to become an upstanding citizen. But, my past, if we call the police they pull up my record and they will definitely have an opinion. I've been getting texts to stay away from you. Wait. What? It's jack. The texts, it has to be jack. But I don't know why he'd take it this far? I'm sorry. I just.. The thought of anyone threatening you.. So, let's call the police and tell them what he's doing. Then it will come back on me. Don't you get it? In any situation, they will look at who he is then they will look at me. Who do you think's gonna win, Sadie? - Definitely not me. - That's ridiculous, Gavin. Is it? I've got years of direct experience here. Look, I'm gonna fix this. I just need you to trust me and give me some time. I need to get home. [instrumental music] are you gonna be okay? Yeah. I want to tell you.. So much. I will, soon, I promise. I won't let anything happen to you, okay? (Taryn) Sadie? - We had a deal. - I know. I'm sorry. I was gonna call, but I just... Got caught up. Right. Well, while you got caught up your mother is home imagining the worst. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. - How was school? - Fine. Really? Because I got a call today saying that you missed your last three classes. Listen, you've never skipped school before so I'm going to trust that this was a one-time thing. Yeah, it was. Thank you. [intense music] mom? Yeah, sweetie. Are you okay? I am sorry about tonight, mom. Really. I love you. I love you too, babe. Goodnight. Goodnight, sweetie. [school bell rings] so, do you think it could actually be jack? Who else could it be? I mean, as soon as I meet Gavin all this stuff starts happening? I told him to back off or I'd go to the police. You think it's a good idea to wait? I mean I can come with you. Gavin doesn't want to involve the police. Sadie! You barely know this guy. But I really like him, and I don't know for some reason I trust him. Head's up. - I guess I had you all wrong. - That makes two of us. Well, let me know when you're done slumming it. Let me know how Rossmore will enjoy your police record. [laughs] well, don't you like jailbirds now? - What are you talking about? - Sadie, let's go. I wish you lots of luck with your new friend. Pick on someone else, jack! I won't let you bully me or Gavin! What are you doing? Let's see how that works out for you, huh? We don't know what he's capable of and I don't want you getting hurt. Hey, what are you doing? I'm going out. That's the third night in a row. Honey, what is going on with you? - Mom. - Just tell me something. And be honest. When you cut school, were you with Gavin? - Yes. - This isn't like you, Sadie. What exactly is like me? Could you explain? Because I'm not so sure at the moment. - I don't want you going out. - Are you saying I can't? I don't think that Gavin is a good influence on you. - You don't even know him. - But I know you. And you have changed since you started hanging out with him. - You're staying home. - Huh! Unbelievable. [door closed] [sighs] [instrumental music] - thank you. - Mm-hmm. I still can't believe you snuck out. I know, I've never done that before. Well, it's not the four seasons, but, uh.. Hey, hector. Uh, someone I want you to meet. Hector, this is Sadie. Sadie, hector. - Nice to meet you, hector. - You too, Sadie. Only half of what he tells you about me is true. - The good half, right? - Hey. Hey, what are you making? A bonfire? Hey, no giant parties tonight, okay, old man? Ahh.. [chuckles] here, let's sit down. [sighs] I've known hector my whole life. He's kind of like a father figure to me. So, you've always lived here? Well, when we're not vacationing in the alps. [chuckles] and do you live with your godmother? Edna is the only mom I've ever really known. I wanna show you something. [mellow music] this was my mom. Right before she had me. She was eighteen in this picture. One year older than I am. It was the last picture ever taken of her. She died during childbirth. Aw. I'm sorry. (Gavin) Edna brought me home from the hospital and she's looked after me ever since. I wouldn't have survived without her. What about your dad? [exhales sharply] I wanna be honest with you. I just, uh.. I don't wanna drag you into.. Into what? Nothing. Uh.. You know what? Now's not the time. Can we talk about something else? You can talk to me about whatever you want.

[intense music] I'm sorry to just unload all this onto you, ms. Tracy. Please. Call me, Edna. [breathing heavily] (Sadie) 'I feel terrible.' jack got hurt and I just didn't know what to do. I didn't get to say goodbye to Gavin. Oh, Gavin is probably feels as bad as you and wants everything to be okay. (Edna) I'm sure you guys will work it out. I don't know what it is, but there's just something about him about us... I care about him so much. I can tell. [bottles clanking] do you smell something? (hector) 'there's a fire! Gavin, Edna! Hurry! Get outside!' (Edna) 'is someone out here? Hector.' (Sadie) 'hector? What happened?' how'd it start? This.. This was no accident. Someone did this, while we were inside? Yes. [intense music] [yelps] [grunting] [instrumental music] [music continues] please. I've looked everywhere. You have to tell me where the letters are. No. What are you doing? I'm just wondering where she is. Mom! There is a reason I kept them hidden all these years. If they come out, I'll lose you too. Mom, that wasn't Gavin's fault, jack started it. I don't wanna hear it. You two should not have been at that party in the first place. You want me to trust you, but you are making it impossible to do so. (Edna) I would do anything for you but that. I don't remember you doing things like this when you were with jack. Mom, jack isn't who you think he is. I never thought that I would say this, but.. Sadie, I am really disappointed in you. [music continues] [music continues] please, you can't say anything. But arson? You need to talk to the police. I know. [bell rings] - we'll talk later, okay? - Hmm. Figure this out. [dramatic music] hey. The acquisitions are going great. What is it, are you okay? I could be better. Why don't you close the door, please? - Yeah. - Take a seat. Is it jack? You know he could lose his scholarship over this. What is going on? I mean, it's like suddenly overnight our kids just imploded. Listen, I.. I made a terrible mistake. What is it? I didn't tell you this sooner 'cause I didn't want you to worry. Okay, well, now you've got me really worried. What do you know about that kid Sadie is seeing? Not much. Only that I'm not very impressed with him. Or the choices that she's been making since she's been dating him. I did a background check on him. - A background check? - Taryn, listen. Sadie's like a daughter to me. And jack's been so upset and after that kid broke his ankle I decided to do a little digging. And? And.. He's not who he says he is. It's, it's shocking. I mean, it's all in there and I-I really feel like we should take some action. For the safety of the kids. [music continues] - Shouldn't you be in school? - Shouldn't you? I have a reputation to uphold. You happen to love school. Seems to me, I'm a bad influence on you. That's what my mother thinks. What do you think? Jack's ankle is broken. I came to tell you, but you weren't there. Where were you? Gavin? [groans] everything is out of control, okay? You need to just walk away, Sadie. What if I don't want to? I can't compete. Guys like jack are always gonna win. He was born into that. So what? I chose you, you just keep pushing me away! I can't protect you from him, Sadie! I know I said I would, but.. Maybe walking away is the only way to do that. I don't need you to protect me. You hungry? Starving. [intense music] - hi. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you guys? This place is amazing. Ah, well, you have excellent taste, my dear. Which makes me think, you are with Gavin why? And you wonder why I never bring anyone around. Oh, I love my boy. Come on in, let me show you. - You guys hungry? - Yeah. Of course, you are. [both chuckle] alright, I'm gonna grab another soda. You want anything? Uh, no, I'm good. [intense music] oh, yeah, can I get a refill, please? Thank you. [music continues] he used to pee the bed all the time when he was little. [both chuckle] a strong start. I know, well, you know.. - Here you go, kiddos. - Thank you. Enjoy, guys. - She's great. - Yeah. - What's wrong? - Can you do me a favor? Can you carry this, just for a little while? - Your knife? No, I can't. - It will make me feel better. - No, I'm not. - Like I said. It's just for show, okay? But sometimes showing it can really help. Please, just carry it for a little bit. For me. Thank you. I mean, if anything were to happen to you, Sadie, I would.. I love you, Sadie. Okay, um.. Edna says we should never eat a cold burrito. - So... Let's eat. - Hmm. Okay. This, this looks legit. Oh, I'm telling you, it is. - Yeah? - Yep. Sorry, we're closed. That's okay. I'm not hungry. [whimpering] [gasping] that wasn't very nice. Please don't hurt me. No! No. We should take a walk. - I don't understand. - He's been caught shoplifting. Multiple times. He, he shattered jack's ankle. That was an accident and jack started that fight. Mom, he's a good person. There is a lot you don't know, okay? Edna, I'm back. This is not who we are, Sadie. This person, he's, he's changed our lives. Come on, it's late, time to go. (Sadie) stop blaming him! You don't know him! (Taryn) he's a criminal! I mean, do you know that he broke into john's house? He told me about his past mistakes. He said it was all just stupid, small kid stuff. (Taryn) well, he lied to you. Edna? You here? Hello? [music continues] [Edna crying] [music continues] ha! Gotcha. [crying] I just want the letters. You give me that... You and the kid can rest easy. [sobs] I'll never give those up. I'll do anything to protect my boy. [intense music] [scoffs] yeah. He's not really your boy though, is he? And if we don't get the letters.. [sobbing] We remove any link to them. [sobbing] - understand? - No! [gunshot] [line ringing] [automated message] 'it's Sadie, leave a message.' (Gavin) 'it's me. Leaving another message.' 'I'm heading to your school. I need to see you.' hey. Sadie, what's going on? Did you get my messages? You lied to me. I've only told you the truth. "just trust me, Sadie. I promise, Sadie. I love you, Sadie." liar. Whoa, what are you talking about? Sadie, please. You have a record. You said it was just stupid kid mistakes, my mom showed me. You broke into the McAllister house? Why? I didn't tell you because I don't want you implicated. - Not good enough. - It was to get his DNA! John McAllister is my father. What? John and my mom were together. Secretly, like eighteen years ago. [chuckles] - Gavin? - Look.. I didn't believe it either so I got a DNA test. - And it was a match? - Yes. I wanted to confront him with the proof but he had his bodyguard remove me from the house. And then the bodyguard started trying to get me to take money to go away. - Did you? - No. I don't want money. I want answers. That's why I was at the party at jack's the day we met. That's why jack's been sending me those texts. And the stunt at the beach. He's covering for his dad. Not just that, Edna didn't come home last night. Something's not right. I know it. And I think you and I being together, it's putting.. What do we do? I can't have you get hurt. I have to go. [instrumental music] [muffled screaming] [intense music] help! Help! 'help! Help!' good. You're awake. Help! Help! Help! He.. You answer, you live. [intense music] [line ringing] [automated message] 'it's Sadie, leave a message.' Sadie, Edna's still missing. What did Gavin Barrett tell you? What? And someone was here. What did he say to you? I don't know what you're talking about. Don't be stupid, Sadie. Alright. Call me back I know you. [music continues] why are you doing this? - I'm trying to help you. - By threatening me? Yes. - Where are the letters? - What letters? I don't know what you're talking about. You know, I asked his godmother. Unfortunately for her, she wasn't very forthcoming. What did you do to her? What did you do to her? It's not your fault you're in this situation, Sadie. Best just tell me what you know. I don't know anything! - Sadie. - Help! - Sadie! - Help! Help! - Time's up. - He.. [music continues] [gunshot] I don't know anything. I prom.. [coughs] [gunshot] [coughing] [both grunt] hey, you! [music continues] mom! (Gavin) 'Sadie, Edna's still missing, and someone was here.' 'call me back.' Sadie. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Anything else you can remember? No. Except, I've seen that man before. He was there the night jack broke his ankle. I just know something's happened to Edna. Can you please send someone to her place? - How do you know? - The guy. He mentioned something about it. - Please. - I think we're good for now. If you think of anything else, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you, detective. Just s-stay. (Taryn) 'thank you, detective.' 'just please let me know' 'if you hear anything.' baby, I am so sorry I doubted you. What we need to do now is let the police do their job. [instrumental music] Gavin? [music continues] Gavin? [line ringing] [dramatic music] [police sirens wailing] alright, send someone to her taqueria. Alright, good. Okay. We've got apb's out for both Gavin and his godmother. We're sending someone to her taqueria. So thank you, Sadie, for all the info. We'll contact you if we have any more questions. But have you called the McAllisters, I think... If we need anything further from either of you, we'll let you know. Hey, it's okay. I know who it is. I gotta go. Not without me. I'll follow you. [dramatic music] - where's Gavin? - 'hello?' - easy, Sadie. - What? What're you talking about? What are you doing here, Sadie? Oh, please, like you don't know that. Gavin is missing. I found his phone covered in blood! I was kidnapped by a guy who works for you or your dad. - What do you mean kidnapped? - Stalking us. Crashing into his car, the threatening texts. 'where is he, jack?' what happened to Edna? Where is she? - Who? - Stop it, jack. Stop lying! I swear, Sadie, I don't know what you're talking about. How should I know where he is? This isn't a game, jack. He broke in here, Sadie. He was in my house! Yeah, I saw the report. The charges were dropped. But you have no idea what actually happened. I do, jack. It was to get your dad's DNA. I know all about it. Right. You know all about it. You have no idea what it was like for me. My dad wouldn't talk about it after we dropped the charges. But I saw what happened that night. And Gavin? He, he looked so familiar. And then he shows up at my party twice? So don't tell me you know all about it, Sadie. Yeah? Well, we're not done here. We need to go. Now. Sadie. Sadie, forget about him. - It's too late. - Too late? He's a criminal. And no one even knows where he is. (Taryn) 'let's go, honey.' I can't believe I ever trusted you. Sadie, please! Why do you always storm off? Honey, wait. Mom, I need you to call detective Fenlow and tell him jack knows more than he's saying. John too. [sighs] there's something I need to do something. Mm-mm. No, no. You're not going anywhere without me. I know I haven't earned it lately but right now, please just trust me. Okay. Okay, I do, I do. Just be careful. Okay. [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [phone beeps] [door opens] [music continues] [door opens] [music continues] [music continues] - Hector! - You are okay? I'm okay, but where is Gavin? I can't find him anywhere. I took him to city hospital. He is under the name Gonzalez. The man who hurt him, he will kill him if he finds him. - Is he okay? - He is alive right now. Those people, they cannot know. He needs to be dead to them. - Thank you. - And be careful. I promise. (Sadie) 'mom, Gavin's at city hospital.' 'I need you to meet me there' 'and bring anything you have' 'with john McAllister's signature on it.' (Taryn) 'what for?' (Sadie) 'I found a stack of letters at Gavin's place.' 'I think they're form john.' 'we need to compare the signatures' you were right, Sadie. Look at this. [camera clicks] what're you doing? Insurance. [camera clicks] [phone buzzing] [intense music] can you ignore it? I'm gonna try and buy us some time. John, hi, I'm so sorry, I didn't have my phone on me. (john) 'everything alright? Jack said you were here.' 'he and Sadie got in a fight and Gavin is missing?' yeah, he is. The police are out looking for him. 'and Sadie is just worried sick.' - are you okay? - Me? I'm, I'm good. Yeah, I'm just going over the contracts for the Laurent acquisition. 'okay, well, I'll let you get back to that then.' 'I'll let you know if I hear anything.' - goodnight, Taryn. - 'Dr. Flores dial 118, please.' (woman over pa) 'Dr. Flores please dial one, one, eight.' - do you think he heard it? - I hope not. [music continues] (john) 'Dr. Flores is at city hospital.' (del) 'got it.' [music continues] [intense music] [music continues] [gasps] [music continues] shh, shh, shh. Mom. Mom. Honey, what's wrong? It's okay. He was here. The man who kidnapped me. He took my bag. Okay, thank you. Honey. Detective Fenlow is gonna pull his pictures from the security cameras. Okay. [suspenseful music] (john) 'alright, give me an update. Di you get them?' it's complicated. I've got the reports and the letters. But the girl knows. Mother probably does, too. [sighs] great. You know what to do. [sighs] [intense music] [grunts] you're awake! Oh, thank god. - Where am I? - You're in the hospital. You were shot. No, no, no. Don't get up. - You just need to rest. - No, it's.. [grunting] look, just in case, I need you to see this through. You're gonna make it, okay? You just need... My mom didn't die in childbirth. She was murdered. They were able to get her to the hospital in time to save me. But Edna is convinced that my father was responsible for her death. I read the letters. The ones from your mom's trunk. All the threatening things he said.. I'm so sorry. We're in a lot of danger. Unless we can prove he's guilty. We can prove it. We can match john to the letters. His signature. He does this weird thing with his j's. My mom has it on all of her papers. You know, I don't want his money... Or apologies. I've only ever wanted him to pay for killing her. He needs to tell the truth. The world needs to know. He took her from me and now I'll never get the chance to know her. Stay calm. Keep walking. - Okay, okay. - Go. Come on. Move. Move. [machine whirring] I can't believe she kept the letters. It's amazing it stayed quiet this long. John, why are you doing this? You're not gonna get away with it! I know what you did. I know that you're Gavin's father... Shut your mouth! Who else knows about this? Call Sadie and tell her to come here now. No! Excuse me? No. I'm not doing that. Oh, you're not? A true parent would never put their child in harm's way. Well, I guess there's nothing left to say here. [groans] I tried to avoid this, Taryn. I really did. Honestly, it was a non-issue until that kid resurfaced. 'I tried to make sure he never knew..' But now he knows too much. He's brought you all into it with him. It was pretty selfish of him, if you ask me. It's not like he can bring his mom back now, can he? [breathing heavily] [phone beeps] del, why don't you head back to the hospital and make sure everything works out over there. I'm good here. [intense music] [intense music] - hey, Sadie. - Where is she? Right this way. Mom. - Oh, Sadie! - I'm so sorry. Oh, no, baby, I'm so sorry. I love you. I love you, too. - What have you done? - Sadie, sit down. Honey. [music continues] Sadie, I want you to know this was not my intention. On multiple occasions, I had del try to deter you. At the beach, all the texts messages. His job was to scare you enough to keep you away from Gavin. But unfortunately, you don't scare so easily. So, it was never jack. No, jack knew Gavin broke in. He was there. Otherwise, one swing and this would all be behind us. 'but I couldn't destroy my son's perception of me.' as his father, I am my son's hero. Maybe you're no hero at all. Maybe you're just a bad father and now I can add murderer. Jack, son, hey. Look, I know that what I did is inexcusable. I knew when I saw him he was your son. I tried to keep you all out of it. I.. I never wanted to come to this. His mother was Marie Barrett. She was my housekeeper. At the time, your mom was pregnant with you, jack. Your grandfather offered to sell me 49% of the company when he retired. You have to understand, I was just starting my career and I couldn't risk losing your mom she had the other 51%. So many years trying to make you proud of me. Hilarious, right? 'you just have to control every situation, don't you?' (john) 'no, I managed it.' I managed it just like I managed it 17 years ago with his mom. Gavin wanted me to tell the world that I killed his mother? This is our life. And he wanted to burn it all to the ground. - My god, john. - Listen, no. I.. Taryn, it wasn't just about the business. 'I love Diane.' I never wanted to hurt her. I just, I made a mistake. Jack... I tried to help Gavin, alright? I tried to give him financial support. I presented an offer for him to just quietly disappear but he wouldn't take it. 'so I went to Gavin's home' and I tried to remedy the problem, once and for all. What is this? Damn it! No, no, no, no, john, john, please stop, stop! Just.. Just, please. Let Sadie go. Let her go, okay? She won't talk. I'm begging you. Please let her go. She.. Pl.. Okay. 'the DNA results, the letters' the signature comparisons, it's.. It's all on the cloud, john. If you let Sadie go, I'll delete everything. [chuckles] there's no need for that. I've had all of your passwords for years. Do you honestly think I'll leave any of this to chance? How stupid do you think I am? [laughs] [yells] run! Run! Go! Go! I only wanted to keep you safe! Make you happy! By cheating on mom? By killing your son? How could you, dad? You've only ever cared about yourself! That's not true! I've always loved your mother. You don't deserve her! [groans] (jack) dad! [intense music] (john) Taryn. We've known each other a long time. I know we can come to an understanding. I made one stupid mistake. 'you're the last people in the world I wanna hurt' 'you know that.' you've always been like... Family. [music continues] I'm sorry. (Sadie) 'john.' wanna know whose number that was on my phone? It was detective Fenlow's cell. They are on their way. Sadie, watch out! [gunshot] (john) 'Taryn, what're you doing?' Sadie, run! [alarm blaring] [grunting] it's over, dad! No more! [panting] are you okay? Get down! Get down! [music continues] [police sirens wailing] - I'm gonna miss you, bestie. - We'll facetime every week. Every day. Don't forget to have fun, okay? Looks like somebody else is gonna be missing you too. - Hey, Gavin. - Hey, Taryn. [sighs] you look good, kiddo. Thanks. Hey. Thanks for helping with Edna's funeral and for helping with the trial and just.. Thanks for everything. Yeah, you're welcome. You... You call me every hour, okay? I will. Okay, seriously, if you start, then I'll start and I won't make it out of the driveway. Okay, okay, I won't. I just.. Ah, just.. - Every hour. - I promise. I love you. [sighs] [mellow music] I don't even know what to say. Um, I wish I could.. I don't know. I wish... I know. Me too. I do have some good news though. I got into bridgecove university. Pretty generous scholarship, too. That's amazing! I'm so happy for you. And guess who's paying for my room and board? - Diane McAllister. - Yeah, how'd you.. We already knew she was sponsoring my clean sweep initiative. That's right. Edna would be really proud. Your mom, too. But, hey! Bridgecove is only a two and a half hours away from bu. Two if I drive fast. [chuckles] [camera clicking] [chuckles] I couldn't help it. Our lighting was perfect and everything. Just like the day we met. I wanna thank you. You've changed me..
