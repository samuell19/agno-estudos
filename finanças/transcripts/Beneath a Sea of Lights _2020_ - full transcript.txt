Where are you going? Mogadishu. Why your visa is cancelled? My mother, she's sick. What's in your pocket? Show me what's in your pocket. I wonder what it smells like. Who cares? Hurry up. They must have put it up yesterday. Just tick your boxes and let's go! Bulb's out. What? Where? Top left. The day shift will fix it. I can't leave her looking like that. - So, are you happy now? - Yes Easy, dhakkan! I'm borrowing this. I bet it smells like jasmine. If you don't shut up, I'll give you another smell to think about. So, what are you doing today? I'm moving to a new house. You need help with your things? What things? How many times have I told you about the rules of safety in this company? Sir, please. It wasn't my fault. Whose fault was it then? - It was one of the other guys. - This is what you always say. Sir, please - just give me another chance. Three warnings in three months! Sorry, I cannot accept that. - Just give me another chance. - Take your settlement. Sir, please. Hand in all your belongings. And get out. 30 days. Huh? What? Terminated. Jobless. 30 days to piss off back to his own country. I'll just go sign off and I'll see you at the truck. You don't look at your hands? What? When you type. You don't look at your hands? What happened to Salim? Vacation? Permanent. Vacation. What about his billboards? Can you handle them? I love my job. Is that what I asked you? This is perfect. Stick with this for now. I might add more later. I'd look like a million dollars wearing this suit. Hello. Indian? I'm Caweys. Aaden? Jimmy isn't here. Who? - Jimmy. - Who's that? The guy that isn't here. Hello. I'm looking for Mr. Jimmish. I saw him come up. Does he live here? Jimmish? That sounds like a sneeze. A sneeze? How appropriate. I'm afraid what Mr. Jimmish has is quite contagious. My name's Darbaan. My number. Where are you from? Mogadishu. Bless you. Mmm. Don't touch my things. At the door. You're a good talker, man. I like it. - What do you do? - Advertising. Advertising? I'm in finance. So the guy, he's your accountant? No, he's an investor. But the market's down, you know? And you live in this palace? No, brother. I just come here to take a shit. The only way you'll get any of that stuff is if you steal it. I'm not a thief. No. But you are a dreamer. All good thieves are dreamers. Saving up for my daughter's dowry will be the death of me. Never have girls! - You married a girl right? - Yeah, so? What did you get for your dowry? I got two buffaloes. And a motorcycle. And I sold one buffalo to come to Dubai. You still have the other buffalo? Yes, I was just talking to her. Gandu, are you back to your dreamland? One day I'm gonna wear that watch. Sir... Hi Caweys. I want to work in sales. I can do it. I work hard. I'm dedicated. I love working here. I'm a people person. You know all my sales team have Bachelor's degrees? Master's, even? And you haven't even finished school. Nobody in this city will offer you a better job if you haven't finished school. So this is all I'm worth? Hey, Dreamer. My name is Caweys. Hey you - you going to your perfume billboard tonight? - Mmhmm. - I got something for you. Here. Hey don't open it until you get there. Hey, are these yours? No. It's fine. It's fine. Listen, all this stuff? They're just things. - Not for us to own. - I don't want to own them. - I just want to know what it's like. -What what's like? What it's like to have things. - You finish school? - Yeah. Well I didn't. You might be happy where you are. But this is all I'm ever going to be. I came here with nothing. - And I'm going to be leaving with nothing. -What you have, my friend, is not nothing. - You know that happens automatically, right? -Huh? Come on. Let's go. Where? Out. - Out where? - Come on! Hey, one from your billboards, yeah? You wanna try? It looks expensive. Expensive? Hi, could I please... ...have a taste of this Natural Strawberry? - Of course. This guy has to give us as many tastes as we want. Until we make up our minds. - Right? - Yeah. Can I please have the Pralines & Cream? Good choice, my favorite. Something for you then? Nah mate. I'm lactose intolerant. Oh, that's the one, huh? Let's go check it out. No? Suit yourself. - Guess how much it is. - How much? 460,000. - It's easy, you know? - What? To take the watch. Yeah. They make demo models. All we gotta do is get our hands on one. Mmhmm. Then what you do is, you go into the store, right? You pretend you're buying. - Yeah? - Right, right. You... You distract the sales agent. Right? - It's so big. - Yeah! Make the switch - the demo for the real thing - and then: You just fucking walk out the front door. Hey, how much is the demo? - How much you got? - Huh? Nah man. You can't afford it. How'd you do that? I'm serious man. - Caweys? - Hi! Um, can I speak to you for a second? I spoke to Ayman. Oh. Sorry about the sales job. It's okay. Hospital bills going up, that's all. Hospital bills? Um. Mother. No wife. Thank you. You know what real money looks like? That guy. You know what's in his bag? Cash. We could do it. Do what? - Take it. - Take it? Take it. These guys carry anywhere between 50,000 to 90,000 dirhams. Fifty-fifty. - That's tempting. - Yeah. It is. I'm not like that. Honest day's work. Honest day's wage. Good luck. Hello beautiful. - You need to get a woman. - I already found a woman. - Huh? And she can type without looking at her hands. I can also do something without looking at my hands. Okay, okay. I don't wanna know. Hey what's your day rate? Like how much money do you make in a day? You make what? 1,500 a month? 1,800. 1,800. So that's... 70 dirhams a day. Yeah? You're worth more than that, aren't you? Apparently not. That's my wallet! 300? What'll I get for 300? That's my money. I like that one. Let me get my wallet! Hey Ramu. Jimmy. - No box. No charger? - No man. - 200. - 200? This is a new model. This is dual sim. 600. - 250. - 550. - 300. - 300 is good. - Who's the guy? - Intern. 500. - 400. - 450. - Jimmy. 400. 400. Hey hey hey. Watch it. - Hey, Ramu. - Hmm? When you wash your face, where do you stop? Here right at the back. Here's your money, man. That's almost two days of your life. Two days. Being poor isn't up to you, man. Staying poor is a choice. Hello? Hey. Hi. My friend, he lost his sunglasses somewhere. Where did you lose them? - Um - He must have dropped them around somewhere in the mall. The security, they told us to come here. Yeah, Lost and Found. - What kind of sunglasses? - Aviators. Right? Yeah. What color? Silver. Sorry, they're not here. What? But they told us... - The frame is silver. Ma'am. Black lenses. Silver frame. - Yeah. What he said. Black lenses. Silver frame. - Try them on. - Really? Yeah. Hey! You look good, man. Thanks. I like it. Nah. You keep them. They're yours. - But they're somebody else's. - No, you earned them man. If you don't know how to take care of what you have... Then you don't deserve it. There's so much stuff just lying around. All you have to do is pick it up. What the fuck are you doing man? Nothing. Shall we get the fuck out of here? Hey. One more off the list. What's left? What do we got? - The car. - The car. Yeah. Yeah man, the car. They didn't let me drive though. I don't have a license, so they didn't let me drive. They didn't let you? They didn't let me drive. Stupid mother fucker. Hey, you. Who are you? I'm the new guy. Go get that car. Park in the basement. Bring the keys with the tag, give them to me. Okay! Welcome to the W Hotel. Welcome to the W Hotel. Here's your card. What the hell were you thinking, Caweys? They fired me. - Of course you got fired. You're lucky you're not in jail. - I can't get another job here. - So go home. Take care of your mother. With what money? You'll find a job back home. Not one that pays enough. Caweys. 30 days here is more expensive than 30 days back home. Don't stay here and get yourself into more trouble. You have the potential to be so much more. Go home. So what are you gonna do, man? I don't even have a job. Who's talking about a job, man? You got 30 days. You can take whatever you want. You can do whatever you want. Look what that got me. - I can't even pay my bills. - What bills? What bills, man? Hey... My mom's medical bills... I send money to her every month. And now I'm short 600. 600? I messed up, man. Done. - What do you mean? - Done. Come on. Time to go. Is that enough? I don't think so man. Caweys. Shh! Relax. It's no problem. Let's get out of here man. You're the boss. 2,825. Thank you, man. - Relax, Mr. Jimmish. You'll get your money. I'm going to make this very simple for you. I'm out of town for the next three days. I will be leaving your passport with Mr. Anwar. He will be expecting your call. And the money. Call him. Before I get back. If not, then I assure you... The next time I see you will be the last time. Where you going? Somewhere those assholes can't find me. How much you owe them? 65,000. I can't pay them back and I can't leave until I do. They have my passport, man. I need your help, man. I need your help. You remember that guy, on the bike? With the bag? He's gonna be here tomorrow. He's gonna have to park his bike somewhere here. And then... He's gonna walk from shop to shop... To shop to shop. - And then walk all the way back. - So? That's the only way to pay Darbaan. - Rob him? - Yeah. Come on, man. - You know I'm not gonna do that. - You saw what that guy did to me today. If I don't pay, I'm done. Look. He has to come to all of these shops. It's money off-the-books. Nobody can report it stolen. Nobody will come after us. It's ours for the taking. Your mother needs how much? Per month? - 1,100. - 1,100. There's at least 80,000 dirhams in that bag. You can have half. That is three years of hospital bills. How are we gonna do it? If I could do it I would have done it already. I will be right here though, man. I'll be right here. I'll be parked right there in the car. If anything goes down, I'll jump in. You'll need this. - I'm not gonna hurt him. - No, it's not for him. You slide it under the strap. You slide it under the strap, you cut it loose, pull the bag, you run! - He's gonna chase me! -How fast are you willing to run for 40,000 dirhams? It just don't feel right, man. Please. I'm not gonna hurt him. - Hey, hey! - Leave him alone! Late night flight available, 1,270 dirhams. Nothing before that? Book it. - Tomorrow is cheaper. - Tonight. Hello? - They're not here for you. Not yet. He's probably not even dead. Hey, don't you want your cut? From the heist? How much? 460. Thousand. He didn't have that much. It's not the real thing. Not yet. - I'm going home, man. - So am I. But not empty-handed. Wait. You paid Darbaan? I need your help man. You gonna walk out the front door? One call from me and you will never see your home again. So. You're going to walk that watch into the store and you're going to walk the real thing out. - What makes you think they're going to leave me alone with that watch even for a second? - Looking like that, they won't. Another one from your list. You're welcome. It's easy. Walk in. Make the switch. Walk out. Then meet me at the fountain at 10:00. Then you're free. You just walked in, made the switch, walked out? I like you, Caweys. Oh... What now? Run. Take it. Here. Man. Your day rate has definitely gone up. Give me the watch. Take it. Give me the watch! Hello? The guy might still be in the building. We got robbed. Half a-- I know what the guy looks like. If I go right now-- Let's go. Where are you going? Mogadishu. Why your visa is cancelled? My mother, she's sick. What's in your pocket? Show me what's in your pocket. - Have a safe flight. - Thank you. Oh fuck. Hello, Mr. Jimmish. Hello, welcome. Hi. Mr. Caweys, welcome aboard. This will be your seat. Thank you. - Hi, I'm Neeraj. - Caweys. Going home? Yes. - Vacation? Permanent vacation. You didn't like it here? I liked it too much. All passengers and cabin crew should now be seated with their seatbelts securely fastened.
