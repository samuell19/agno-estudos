Children were molested here! And it's directly connected to the football program. Joe Paterno did know that Sandusky - was abusing boys in the shower. - No, he did not! I firmly believe, in his mind, he did what he thought was right. I think Joe Paterno's getting thrown under the bus here a little bit. He is not the attorney general, he's the football coach. He was the Godfather! He was aware of what happened, and allowed it to happen. Joe! Where are you going? - I'm going to the john. - It's back here. It's right across the hall from where we just were. Come on! Oh, yeah. I got turned around. Yeah, it's just right over here across the hall. Penn State! Penn State! Eight inches of winter's wrath expected, as Joe Paterno seeks win number 409 to surpass all Division I football coaches. Take one. Give me the stats on Bolden and McGloin. Go to mascot. Joe Paterno up in the booth again today. That is certainly not his preference. Joe is coaching from the press box today due to a hip injury sustained in practice couple weeks back. Let's go! Guido. What's that? Bobby, no shots of Joe in the booth. Look, look. - Busted. - Number 31, please. - Give me the camera. - Nope, nope. I'm deleting. No pictures of JoePa. As college football seems to change more rapidly than ever, he remains the constant. JoePa. Penn State. At age 84, he is not just still in the game, in many ways, he is the game. And with one more win, another milestone. And there's the kick! Penn State offense will take over on its own 35-yard line. Ready in blue? McGloin out of the shotgun, heaving long. Complete! We asked Joe Paterno, how do you get that message down to the sideline? He writes it down. If I call 41 power, I better see 41 power. All right. Split left, drag 46 strong. Watch if they sub. Check their angle if they do. Catch 'em by surprise. And the snow continues to fall. Redd takes on second down, and they get another Penn State first down at the 25. Here at Penn State, we're still at 0-0, but the crowd could not be more electric. Everybody here is wondering if JoePa can deliver an historic 409th win for the Nittany Lions. And the tailback... Bolden fumbles! Illinois has got it. Shit. A straight fumble by the sophomore QB. Let's go, defense! Get that motherfucker out of this game right now! Who the fuck was that? They want Bolden out of the game. - You want him out? - No. Keep him in. Give me a shot of Bolden on the sidelines. End of the first half, exactly where we started, zero-zero. Stupid mother... - You goin' down? - No. By the time I get down with this gimp, halftime will be over. Coach is staying up here. Jay's comin' down. Jay is on the move, without his dad. Jay in the locker room? That's insane. - They hate him. - The team? Yeah, he's a total doorknob. Why do you think Joe won't retire? Oh, what? Like if they wait long enough, he'll turn into head coach material? You motherfuckers! Hey, hey, listen to me! You think you can get on the headset and talk to me like that? What are you guys, a bunch of fucking... Back off! You were out there! Show some respect! - Come on. - Give me a break! Honey, you remember Jerry Sandusky and Dottie. Good to see you. How ya doin'? They need you back on that line, Jerry. - We miss you. - They're doin' okay. You still think he's a pedophile? - You know, nobody read your article. - Fuck you. It's been six months. That popcorn kernel didn't pop. Time to move on. That's just my opinion. Well, nobody's asking for your opinion. We got a heads-up from the attorney general's office. They're charging Jerry in the next few weeks. What, the business with the shower? They have more than one incident. What with the same kid? Multiple incidents with the same kid. - And multiple kids. - Oh, Jesus. All in our locker room? I don't know. Look, evidently, you two might be named in the indictment. What the fuck you talkin' about? Cynthia says they've got no case. She's gonna get it thrown out. We just need to ride it out. That's easy for you to say, Graham. I am in this 100% with you. Oh, we're indicted alongside an accused pedophile and you're... Wow, I just hit the motherlode. You're not taking a fall, Gary. I will make sure that doesn't happen. - Hey, guys. Can I get a quick hit? - Of course. Ready one, take one. I'm here with Penn State University President Graham Spanier, Vice President of the University Gary Schultz, and Athletic Director Tim Curley. You are looking at a possible 409 wins for Penn State's own JoePa. How does that feel? Mara, we couldn't be more excited. Ready one, take one! If you want to get a sense of how respected, how revered, Joe Paterno is here at Penn State, look at this, a monument they built to him calling him a coach, an educator, and a humanitarian. - We are... - Penn State! - We are... - Penn State! - We are... - Penn State! And, hut! Scheelhaase to throw to the end zone, touchdown! - 3:32 to go in the third. - Oh, shit. It's Illinois who strikes first. - Paterno on two. Standby two. - Tighter on Paterno. Push him, slow push him. Ready, two? Take two. Third and goal. McGloin fumbles the football, picks it up again, sacked at the 15. That is the sixth fumble of the day by Penn State. Fourth and goal, the kicking unit comes out. Fera's 30-yarder is good! Penn State's on the board. It's seven-three. On four. Scheelhaase is gonna run again on third and 12. This time Penn State's ready to force fourth down for Illinois. Take one. 3:05 to go. Eighty yards for the Penn State offense. Nittany Lions need a touchdown. What's the story with Moye? Fractured metatarsal. Doctor says he can go if it's an emergency. Well, this looks like an emergency. You got Moye? Moye! Moye! Get Moye! Moye, let's go! Come on, come on, let's go. The team needs you. Joe needs you. Go! Go! And McGloin, the junior quarterback from Scranton. McGloin throws, it's completed! And who makes the grab but Derek Moye, coming back from a broken bone in his left foot. Now we're in business. They're gonna crowd the line, think we're gonna run, let's go to Brown. Take one. Ready, two... Right back to Justin Brown! First down, Penn State driving. All right, we got a game here, folks. Everybody stay focused. Let's do our jobs. - Fourth down and sixth. - Let's go! Penn State needs to convert. McGloin heaves it to the end zone for Moye. It is... Incomplete! But there are multiple flags on the play. Penn State's gonna get another shot. Nice. - Time out, time out. - Time out. Time out. Time out. Time out. All right, Coach. What do you want to do? Heavy right, 25 counter. That's good. Heavy right, 25 counter. - Come on, baby. - Heavy right, 25 counter. All right. Heavy right, 25 counter. Let's go. A minute-20 to go in the fourth quarter, down by four, Penn State needs to get into the end zone for the first time today. McGloin handing off Silas... He's in the end zone! Touchdown, Penn State! With a minute-eight to go, the Nittany Lions are into the end zone. - An 80-yard touchdown drive. - Yes! Yes! Penn State hoping to close it out and give Joe Paterno win number 409, making him the winningest coach in the history of Division I football. Five seconds. 42-yarder to tie it. No good! Penn State wins! 10-7. Win 409 for Joe Paterno as head coach at Penn State... Sara Ganim. Holy fucking shit. Criminal charges, Gerald Sandusky. Forty counts. Involuntary, deviant sexual intercourse, person less than 16 years of age. Indecent assault, person less than 16 years of age. - Aggravated indecent assault... - Person less than 13 years. Jesus... What the fuck. Where'd it go? - Reload. Reload... - I'm reloading. - Is it the computer? - I don't know. Give me a second. Every other site's working. They pulled it. - Mike. - Hey, man, are you home? - No, I'm on my way. - Are you driving? She told me I could take the car. - I didn't... - No, it's fine. Listen. I need you to pull over for a second. Can you do that? Okay, look. The charges against Jerry went up online. They disappeared like a minute later, which means somebody probably posted them by mistake, but a lot of people saw it, so... It's happening now. They're gonna arrest him. Probably tomorrow morning, Sunday at the latest, and they're gonna have to post the grand jury presentment when they're ready to bring him in, so the whole story's gonna be there. It's public. And I won't say your name. May use your initials, but... It's happening. Aaron? Aaron? Hey, buddy. Hey. - Hey, Joe. - Yeah. You wanna have dinner with Don and Shirley on Sunday night? No. Come on, they want to celebrate the win. Well, let 'em go celebrate by themselves. - So, no? - Well, I... All right, let's see how it plays out on Sunday. Well, I've got a board meeting in Philly. Maybe after a day by himself, he'll want to be, you know... You asked me a question. Don't ignore the answer. Oh, hang on one second, Sheryl. I got Scotty on the other line. Hey, Scotty. I'm on the phone. - Ma, I need to talk to Dad. - Okay. Joe, call Scotty when I'm off. I'll call him when I finish the practice script. Scotty, he's gonna call you back when he's finished with the practice scripts, okay? No, no, no, no! Ma, I gotta... Yeah, Sheryl. Special Olympics... Oh, no, it's a 5K. Come on. You gotta be kiddin' me. We saw the charges, but was that one victim or two victims? Just tell me this. When's the guy gonna get arrested? Isn't he considered a flight risk? John says there may be somebody else named in the indictment. Jessie, is someone other than Jerry Sandusky named in the indictment? Jessie? Hey, it's Charlie Thompson at the Patriot-News, for Bill. No, I can wait. Somebody needs to call Graham Spanier! I'll do it. What'd he say about your first article? Nothing. Him and everybody else. Six months went by. It was like I wrote about a yard sale. Ask Spanier if he thinks he's gonna get fired. They're not gonna fire the president of Penn State. Jerry hasn't worked there in a decade. Bill, when are we gonna see this grand jury presentment? You're either charging the guy or you're not. Sara... It's up. Aaron... I don't want you to read it. Aaron. Everything's on there. It's not gonna change anything... You said I didn't have to tell you. With the grand jury and the cops... It's on the computer, Aaron. Your mother can't be the only person in the country not to read it. Looks like Victim One was 11 when it started. Sandusky performed oral sex on him more than 20 times. Sandusky also had Victim One perform oral sex on him one time. Jesus. Touched Victim One's penis with his hands. Victim One did not want to engage in sexual conduct with Sandusky, knew it was wrong. And Victim Two? Ten years old. Anal intercourse. Shit. - Hello? Dawn? - Hi. I'm gonna be in your area in a couple hours. Should I stop by? I don't know. Well, how about I head that way, and then if it doesn't feel right, you can just... You can send me back. Dawn? Dawn? Victim One's mom. Call me from the car. We'll finish the piece while you drive. The indictment alleges that former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky used The Second Mile, the charity he founded in 1977, - to get access to and molest boys... - Okay. Many of whom were vulnerable due to their social situations. That's great. Many of the alleged incidents happened in the Lasch building, the football building on Penn State campus. With football season well underway now, for many fans, it doesn't get any bigger than Penn State. But the case against one of that team's long-time coaches is unfolding, and quickly. Charged with abusing several boys at a program he'd started, former coach Jerry Sandusky, once heir apparent to the legendary Joe Paterno... is charged with sexually abusing eight boys. And now two high-ranking university officials, the athletic director and a vice president, face charges in court, accused of looking the other way after several mothers came forward. One mother told reporter Sara Ganim she feels betrayed by Penn State, as details emerge of what she sees as a cover-up, saying one of her sons complained about Sandusky, but no one listened. Penn State forever, molder of men. Well, where is that integrity now? If these allegations are true, then this goes to the very top of the athletic department at Penn State, and one would have to think that there would have to be some kind of housecleaning. They do go conservative... is he gonna make it pay off? I can't believe it, ya know? And then on top of it, they indicted Tim and Gary too. - For what? - For what. For perjury, for lying to the grand jury. For failing to protect children. They testified in front of the grand jury just like you did, Dad. You read it, right? You read the grand jury presentment? No. They indict me? - No. - So? Wait, are you... Okay, I am going to print this thing out so you will read it. I got Nebraska a week from today. They're seven-and-one, just so you know. Spanier. Put me in the ground. Hey. Hey, Scott. Got something I want to run by your dad. Yeah, come on in. He's watching Nebraska. How do they look? Good is how they look. Northwestern's up by four, but they're not gonna hold it. All right. The allegations about a former coach are troubling, and it is appropriate that they be investigated thoroughly. With regard to the other indictments, I wish to say that Tim Curley and Gary Schultz have my unconditional support. I have complete confidence in how they have handled the allegations about a former university employee. I am confident the record will show that these charges are groundless, and that they conducted themselves professionally and appropriately. Why do you say that, about Gary and Tim? 'Cause it's true. Grand jury doesn't think so. You think that's right? Well, what do I know? But I wouldn't go stand in front of the bull waving a flag. This school should look like we give a hoot, you know? We want everything run down until we know what actually happened. That's a huge slap in the face to Gary and Tim. They were protecting the school. Do what you want. You're asking me, I'm sayin'. I think it's a stupid thing to say. Well... I'll look at it again. Okay. You need anything, give me a call. Hey. - Yeah? - Hey, Jay. Just bending your dad's ear. Latet anguis in herba. - What does that mean? - It's Virgil. - Means you're gonna be fine. - Northwestern's up by four. - That's not gonna last. - Yeah. Thanks for stopping by, Graham. See you soon. Oh, boy. What was that? Box of rocks. He wants to be everybody's friend. He's gonna get himself fired. Watch. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. There's peppers and provolone on the stove. Heat it up. - Yeah, I talked to Guido. - Yeah. He thinks this is gonna be more than just a sports story. You think? Did you read it? The presentment? No. I just got here. Yeah. What's the hurry? The guy only fucked eight children. - What is with the talk? - Hey, hey. Just, somebody other than me has to read this thing. Oh, is that what you're doing? Sittin' around reading everything? Can you take this someplace else, guys? I'm trying to work here. Anybody care? You got your own homes now, ya know. Well, what goes on in major college sports programs are, they become little fiefdoms, and the college coach becomes all-powerful, and Joe Paterno is like a god on that campus. He's the leader. I understand there's a university president, there's an athletic director, but we know who's running Penn State. It's JoePa. Mailbox. One. You have one new message. Sara, it's Dawn. Can we... I'm sorry, let's do this tomorrow. We're pretty wrung out over here. Aaron's... Why don't you come by in the morning. Okay? Thanks. - Where's Juliet? - Food? Hey! Did you just get here? - Yeah. - Liam, Mindy. Sara. She graduated. - She's gonna crash here a few nights. - What up? She's the one that got Sandusky arrested. You did? No. No, no. I didn't. He's fucking disgusting. It's sick. Wait, she's the cub reporter, right? Does anybody call you Cubby? No. For 67-year-old Jerry Sandusky, a jubilant career at Penn State has dwindled to a perp walk and prosecution. A Penn State graduate team assistant allegedly witnessed a 2002 rape by Sandusky, involving a 10-year-old boy in a shower at Penn State's football facility. The assistant told Coach Paterno about it, and Paterno is said to have told Athletic Director Tim Curley, and university official Gary Schultz. Hi, I'm Sara Ganim, and I work with the Harrisburg Patriot-News. I was wondering if I'd be able to ask... No. I'm not talking to anybody. Thank you. You're Gary Schultz' assistant? - Right? Okay... - Get off the property! - I just wanted to... - Get off the property! - Okay, I'm getting off. - Not fast enough! Okay! Fuck. - Hello? - Hey. So... After two days of complete and utter silence, the national news finally noticed we published a story. You got time to talk to CNN? Yeah, I just need a minute. - I've got somebody who's really excited. - How dare you! To disturb my wife like that! The Pennsylvania attorney general says that Coach Paterno is facing no criminal charges because he followed the law by quickly telling what he knew to his superiors. What she didn't say was if he had a moral obligation to do more. Steve Garban's pretending he's not home. No one from the board of trustees will answer our call. - Hello? - Mother of Christ. Put out a damn statement so we can be through with this already. We should have done it six months ago when it first came out in the paper. People need to hear from you. This is not a smart move, Guido. I'm not a judge, but... There's a legal process happening here. Okay. All right. A legal process happening here. - So... - Legal process. Oh, my God... Ma? Mommy? What's wrong? - Mommy? - It's shocking, if it's true... - You okay? - We're deeply saddened... When I heard what I heard, I reported it right way... To? Tim and Gary. He did what he was supposed to do. - Right. In 2001. - What? 2001? Yeah. I told the grand jury. Right, and you should say what McQueary told you, right? An assistant coach informed me that... An assistant coach informed me what? McQueary couldn't put his... a sentence together. He couldn't catch his breath. He was all over the place. So, he told you that they were having sex? No, he didn't... He didn't know what he saw. Come on. They were touching maybe. Who knows? All I know is, what he saw upset him. That's... He was rattled. Ya know? Something happened. So why does the presentment say anal rape? - It says that? - Didn't you read it? - It says anal sex. - Oh, well, you're the lawyer. There's no such thing as consensual anal with a 10-year old... He was distraught! He didn't make sense! It was clear whatever he was talking about was inappropriate. I got that. So, I called Tim, and I called Gary. And if it's true... I get everybody's upset. We're upset. But meanwhile, you gotta... You gotta let a legal process unfold... Dad, did you know anything else about Jerry? What do you mean? Why are you saying that? - I just told you. - I don't know, but... - What about Jerry? - When you read it, you can see the guy had a clear problem. Ya know? Maybe... I didn't read the thing. You told me about the thing, Scott, and you told me again. - I know. I'm just saying... - So I know. So, you're badgering me. You're badgering me I don't like it. I got a game to prepare for. That's what's important to me now, Scott. Whatever these things are... People think that you knew about all of it. - But I don't care what people think! - 2001. 1998. JoePa runs the school. How could he not know? Well, I didn't know. I don't know what they're talking about. What am I, omniscient here? Well, yeah, that's what they think you are. - And they're writing stories. - What about rumors? There's something funny about this Jerry guy. Nothing like that? What happened to you? You're telling me about a rumor? A rumor? What's that? Is that why I sent you to law school? Gossip like that, what it does to people? You have any idea... What about your Uncle George? How come he wasn't married. Everybody said, something's wrong with him. Whatever this is, I don't understand it. It's garbage! Jerry Sandusky. What is he? I thought he was... He was unfocused and such a pain in the butt, but yes, kids were... He had kids around all the time. These were hopeless, helpless, lost causes. He started the biggest charity in the history of this state. Every heavy hitter, every high roller donating every week, checks coming in by the dozens. I never saw anything like it. He's honored by the president of the United States. I got a statement. Sue and I have devoted our whole lives to helping young people. The fact that someone we thought we knew might have harmed young people like this, if it's true... Well, we were fooled, along with a whole bunch of professionals who are trained in this kind of thing. And we're sorry. We are grieving... For all of them. We'll release that. That's the end of it. I have practice. Here to say a few words about our guest of honor Jerry Sandusky is his long-time colleague, mentor, and friend of over 30 years, head coach of Penn State Nittany Lions, Joe Paterno. Jerry and Dottie, they always had kids, they adopted kids, they fostered children, all the time, everywhere I look, there was kids, kids kept appearing. I didn't know what was goin' on. I said, what are they doing? I mean, I thought they were their kids, right? Little did I know, it turns out, Jerry started this charity. This wonderful thing, ya know? All these kids... I had no idea. I had no idea... I had no idea. All these kids, all these kids, all these kids... Hundreds, hundreds of children. - Thousands. - Thousands! Thousands! Thousands! That's awesome. Okay, so we'll start with Matt. He's working out a little bit. Watch his knee. You've gotta be kiddin' me. These guys are fucking animals. All right, come on, guys. Closed practice. Let's go outside, come on! JoePa's gonna give his regularly scheduled press conference tomorrow. Is this the locker room where the incidents took place? Could we just get a couple shots... Good day to you, sir. All right, come on. Outside. Outside, please. Tom, could we get a lockdown on the last building, please? Thanks. I have no idea why Mike McQueary is still on this staff. He was a 28-year-old man, and he saw an older man commit a sexual act against a 10-year-old, and did nothing about it. He walked away, and went home, and talked to his dad about it. And then decided to see Joe Paterno the next day. All right, guys, let's go! Ladder! We're doing what we were born to do. Sara? Are you Sara Ganim? I'm Hugh Lewison, with NBC. Do you have a second? Oh, I don't. I'm sorry. I got places to go. Just two seconds. I just need a couple of phone numbers. - Do you mind? - Oh, yeah, no. I have a piece that's got to run in, like, 10 minutes, so I got to get to my interview. Who are you interviewing? - I'm sorry. - Look, I just drove four hours to find you. You're the only goddamn person who's followed this thing. Can you tell me why I can't find a police report from when McQueary reported Sandusky in the shower with the kid in 2001? I know, it's a real head-scratcher. Do you have it? You don't have to show it to me. - Just tell me if you've seen it. - Read the article I wrote. There's no police report from 2001. But the indictment says there was an investigation. No? Can you just nod or shake your head? I'm being followed by this guy from NBC. Forty news organizations want to interview you. - He's still following me. - Where are you going? To interview the mom. You better lose him. Keep him away from the mom. This is not Starsky and Hutch, David. Go away! Thank you. - Gary? - Oh, hey. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Fine. They're gonna bring me in today, but I don't think they're gonna keep me. To jail? Oh, God, Gar. Everything's gonna be fine, Kim. Hey, listen, Kim. Could you do me a favor? Anything. - Go into my office... - Okay. - To the desk. - Yeah. Unlock the bottom drawer. You see the transition file? Yep. Could you bring that to the house? Of course. Anything else? You want some food? No, no, no. I'm good. Okay, Gar. Call me if there's anything at all. Yeah. Will do. Bye. No, no, no! Don't hit yourself. Hit him! Set! - They're gonna move us. - How come? It's not safe. Since it came out, people know who he is. You don't have to... Aaron sleeps on the couch every night. Can't sleep in a bed since Jerry's... I don't know what you need to ask anymore. It's all on the thing online. He didn't want me to read it, but... Was there anything that surprised you? I didn't want her to know the parts with, like... I was never in the room when he told the whole thing. Not even at the grand juries. I wanted to. I mean... It was so hard for him. He fainted, threw up... - Mom. - He says testifying was... Can I say? He says the grand jury testimonies were the worst things he's ever had to do in his life. Other than... I am sorry you have to talk about this again... It's bullshit, okay? Jerry's already out. The judge was a volunteer at The Second Mile. Sent him home. Unsecured bail. It's been three years. From the first day, it's the same thing... Shit. I'm sorry. Let me just try and silence this thing. What were you saying? The first three... It's been three years? We reported it at the school as soon as he said somethin'. We went to the principal, Karen Probst. Write her name down. Fucking bitch. You know what she said? She told me, when I said, call the police, that man touched my kid, she said, I think you should go home and sleep on it, because I'm not sure this is something you wanna do. You're very emotional. She put in a cover-your-ass call to Child Services once we were already there. If we hadn't raised hell, she would have pretended the whole thing never happened. Oh, that Jerry... He's got a heart of gold. Everybody loves him. He's not going to jail. I'm just gonna be another kid on the front page in the newspaper with a big liar stamped across his head. Look, I don't know how this case is gonna turn out, but I can tell you that right now people look at you as the first person that's had the courage to come forward and stand up to a really intimidating public figure. And because of what you did, now five other guys have had the courage to come forward and do the same thing. There's no grand jury investigation without you. You started this whole thing. And if you didn't say anything, Jerry would still be hanging out at Second Mile with a bunch of kids, trying to pick his favorite. Bobby, go find Kate. Go! She's at dance. That's Aaron's brother. He's 10. Yeah, that's how old I was when... So... just keep it to football tomorrow, at the press conference. Yeah, I know. Did you read it? No, I didn't read it yet, Jay. How am I gonna read it? After Nebraska, I haven't had the time. You know, Scott gets worked up. Your mother gets worked up. That's not my job. Understand? Or your job. We don't get worked up. You get hysterical every time your team gets attacked, that's a short career. You have to wonder right now where Joe Paterno's head is. So much is swirling around him. And, you know, maybe there's a little bit of a disconnect, maybe he doesn't fully understand the gravity of what's going on, he's talking about beating Nebraska on Saturday. Good hit, good hit. Is Coach Paterno under investigation as well? No, he's not regarded as a target at this point. But somebody needs to question what I believe is the moral requirements for a human being that knows that sexual things that are happening to a child. Now whether you're a football coach, or the university president, or the guy sweeping out the building, I feel that you have a moral obligation to call us. Commissioner, thank you so much for being here. I know you spent 30 years with the FBI, you say you have never seen anything like the alleged sexual abuse allegations in this case, and you say you want to know why the police were not called. I don't want to criticize Joe Paterno or anybody else. But any human being who has this kind of information, or who has knowledge of child sexual abuse, should call us... Nobody wants to ask why Mike McQueary didn't call the police. I mean, he was the one who was there. He's a grown man. He comes into my kitchen. Dad went to who he thought was the police. Gary ran the campus police. Right, Scotty? Gary also knew about that thing in 1998 and did nothing about it. Wait, what thing in 1998? There was another kid, Ma. In the shower, in the Lasch building. That kid told his mom, his mom called the cops. The cops got Jerry over to the kid's house while they were in the other room listening. While Jerry's there? - Yes. - Yeah. And the mom says, you can't do this ever again with anyone, and Jerry says, I can't promise that with the cops listening. They don't arrest him. They just say, don't shower with little boys. - That was the end of it. - How was that the end of it? Because all they had was showering and hugging. - Not a crime. - A hug goodbye? No. Naked, wet hugging. And that's not a crime? Because the DA, for some ungodly reason, decided that it wasn't. Well, why isn't anyone talking about the DA's moral obligation? Did Gary tell you about that one too? Why do you think the police commissioner is trying to say that Joe has got a moral responsibility? It's because they missed it. You know what? Everybody missed it. Everybody! How come no one's talking about the frickin' Second Mile? Those idiots, they were told what happened, and nobody decided to say, hey, maybe we should keep this guy away from the hundreds of little boys we got running around? What was Gary thinking? Listen to this. Schultz, equivocating on the definition of sexual in the context of Sandusky wrestling with and grabbing the genitals of the boy... I mean, who equivocates on grabbing a kid's genitals? Okay, let's go. Let me have that thing. - Oh, great. Thank you. - Of course. Is there anything else I can do? No. No you better go. You don't want 'em getting interested in you. Yeah, I grabbed another file in case you need it. Oh, great. Thanks. Okay. An hour shower? Same as what happened three years ago in '98. Why does the man still have keys to the building? It's part of his retirement deal. Just tell the man he can't come in here with little boys. Cops told him that the first time it happened. Didn't seem to make much of an impression. Sit down with the guy and explain that, under no circumstances, can he come into university facilities with a child. No workouts. No goddamn showering. All right, so we talk to the charity, we talk to Jerry, and we call Child Welfare. And they will file it with the police? Yeah. This is a fucking nightmare. Will the court officer now read the charges against Gerald A. Sandusky? Sandusky performed oral sex on Victim One on a number of occasions, had Victim One perform oral sex on him, gives Nike shoes, ice hockey equipment... overnight at his residence, basement, bedroom, performed oral sex on him more than 20 times. Victim Four. Attend the pre-game banquet, sits with Sandusky at the coach's table... hotel room, the Alamo Bowl... inserts his erect penis into Victim Four's mouth. Attempted to penetrate Victim Four's anus both with a finger and his penis. Holding the boy against a wall performing oral sex. What is sodomy? Oh, come on. Achilles and Patroclus? Nessus and Uralus. What does he know about these perverted things? Joe's having a press conference today, so if we could do this as quick as possible, I'd like to get overthere. Do you have a hairbrush or a comb? - In your bag? - No. No. - Lipstick? - No. No. Huge bag and you don't have anything. - What? - Okay. What do we think about this coat? I think it's gonna strobe. - Yeah. Let's take it off. - Take the coat off? I've got a yellow shirt on I can wear. You know what? Let's keep it on. - The coat on? - Button up. Button up. Yeah, it's gonna help you. Legendary head coach Joe Paterno, getting ready for what may be the toughest press conference of his life today. These will be his first on-camera statements since this scandal broke, and the stakes are incredibly high for him. That statement we put out the other day, it had no impact. We do it today, we do it head on, on camera, and then it's over. All right, McQueary told me he saw something inappropriate, so the next day I called Tim... - Wait, wait... - And he came over. - You called him when? - I called him the next day. It was Saturday, yeah. I got the call, I waited till the weekend was over 'cause I wasn't gonna ruin his weekend. - He's got kids. - Don't say that. Scott asked a question. Well, do you want me to lie? You can't say that you heard about child abuse, and then you waited a couple days so you didn't ruin someone's weekend. Presumably the rape ruined the child's weekend. - Mary Kay. - Put it this way, you hear about someone diddling my kids? Don't wait the weekend! She's right, she's right. You can't say it, okay? - So, what do I say? - Okay, this should be football. Right? It's a weekly football press conference! What are we doing? We're sittin' around... They're standing out there. There's people... Everybody wants to know what happened. That's right. You do it, and then it's done. - Right. - Okay. Sure. So, where were we? Did you call the police? But it is a press conference, Scott. It's not a deposition. It's gonna be a lot worse than a deposition, Dad, this is the media. They got nothing to eat but you. So the press is going to ask you why didn't you pick up the phone yourself? Michael McQueary was a mess when he talked to me. What did the kid say happened? I didn't talk to the kids. I talked to McQueary. Wait, so... so who talked to the kid? - Was it Gary? - I don't know who talked to the kid. I don't know. Who knows? Was he okay? - Okay, who? - The child. I don't think the press is gonna get into this, hon. No, I'm asking, Guido. I mean, the kid knows what happened. What did he say? I think nobody talked to the kid. They didn't find the kid. I don't, I... I don't understand. Wait. How could they not find the kid? They could just ask Jerry. Well, they didn't look for him. It was an oversight. Oversight. So did you ask about the kid and they just never followed up? Mary Kay. - Did you ask? - What are we doin' here? Did you ask? This is more than a football legacy. This is about people, and if we can't protect our kids, we, as a society, are pathetic. - Gar. It's Kim. - Hey. - You back home? - Yeah. Good. You okay? Yeah, super. Listen, Kim, I really... I made a copy of the file in the envelope. - Okay. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - It's habit, you know? I don't take anything from the file without a copy. Yeah, of course. Of course. I gave you the original, Gar. I shouldn't have done that. It's fine, Kim. I'll bring 'em back in the morning. No, they won't let you in the building. I'm concerned about hiding evidence if the originals are gone. There's, like, fingerprints and things. They look into all that. What if they ask me about it? I don't know, Kim. Just tell 'em the truth. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Look, I met with Joe. We talked about it, and... To go behind Jerry's back to his own organization and the Department of Child Welfare before we've even looked at the guy face-to-face and asked him what happened seems... I don't know, inhumane. What happened to calling Child Welfare? And fucking Second Mile? Look, we just gotta ask the guy what happened. I don't know, maybe it's a misunderstanding. Graham agrees. Joe agrees. - Who's driving? - Come in my car. I'll drop you home after practice. There's a couple of reporters out there. Keep 'em to the side so we don't run anybody down. - Yeah. - What do you mean? Why aren't they at the press conference? Probably wanna follow you there. Hey, you can moon 'em on the way. Scott, that's not appropriate right now. Says who? Guys, they don't want to do it right now. The press conference. We got practice in 40 minutes. It's now or never. They don't want a press conference today. - It's canceled. - Without my permission? Yeah. Due to the ongoing legal circumstances surrendered around the recent allegations and charges, we have determined that today's press conference cannot be held and will not be rescheduled. We will not have any additional comment on this matter. Ever? It won't ever be rescheduled? Don't you guys feel you have an obligation to talk about this? Crime & Punishment, new developments in the child sex abuse scandal that has rocked Penn State's legendary football program. Today a regular weekly news conference with Penn State's head coach Joe Paterno was canceled. It would have been his first since the scandal broke. Reporters were waiting when he left practice. Guys, you got good questions, but I can't... I can't answer them. Sorry. I just can't do it. So far, two top university officials, Timothy Curley and Gary Schultz, have been charged with failing to report allegations of abuse that occurred on university property. Sara Ganim, a reporter at the Patriot-News. Sara, you spoke to two of the moms of the victims allegedly sexually molested by Sandusky. What did they tell you? I mean, both of them are extremely... Feeling extremely let down and betrayed by Penn State, and those feelings are coming from the charges levied against Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, and then, the... moral allegations basically... I hope you can hear me, there's loud airplanes flying above us... Against Joe Paterno and Graham Spanier... And one mom in particular, her son came forward in 1998, was not believed, and they feel awful that other children were victimized because her son was not believed. The university canceled Paterno's news conference just minutes before it was scheduled to begin, and the school freely admits that the reason is because of the child rape scandal marring Paterno's program. Calls for Paterno's resignation are really starting to pile up. I think it's time to call somebody. We need tactical advice. - Like a crisis guy. - Perfect. Who do you got? - I don't know. - Let me google it. You're googling it? - Yeah. - Well, that's great. We're a major university in the middle of a very serious public relations debacle, and you're solving it on Google. - Joe! - Is that what I want though, a public relations spin? PR is marketing. We already got a marketing guy sitting right here. - So what, then? - Give me your phone. - No, I can do it. - Give me your phone! Tell me what to put in. What, like, a crisis manager? - That sounds about right! - No, no, no. Crisis management. A crisis management firm. - Okay, I'm good now. - What's the difference? Why aren't all these reporters over at Jerry's? I'm calling Frank. He knows somebody who deals with this kind of thing. The car guy? You're giving me crap for Google, and you want advice from Frank at the car dealership? Doesn't the school have a crisis manager? Does it look like the school has a... Sorry, Ma. Okay, McGinn and Company. Dan McGinn. Helping clients solve their most perplexing and important reputation challenges. - What, is he on a top 10 list? - Yeah, he's on a top 10 list. - Should I call him? - Yeah, call him. Sure, why not? Ask for Dan McGinn. Oh, hi, hi. May I speak with... Dan McGinn. You're walkin' weird, man, you get Sandusky'd last night? Yeah, he sucked me off and then we played Xbox. - It's a lie. - What? Some fuckin' piece of trailer trash set him up. - Jerry? - Kid probably tried to blackmail him. Jerry told him to fuck off, and he's like, I'm gonna sue your ass for $20 million for damage to my rectum. Total fabrication. It's somebody from the track team. - Our track team? - Yeah. Did you see about JoePa? Of course I saw it, man. I don't even want to talk about that. You the faggot? - Hey. - Hey! Get him! Get him! Go! Go! No showers, huh? Showers? Trash, huh? I'm gonna beat your ass, kid. You fucking faggot! I'm happy to come down, Guido. I've been watching the coverage. It sure looks like things have begun to spin out. Yeah. It's making this school look like shit. They have no idea how to get in front of it. You lost me for a second. Are you looking for advice for Coach Paterno? - Or for the university? - For both. The thing is, if you hire me, the issue is, sir, I'm not sure you and Penn State are two entities with aligned interests right now. Well, I never thought of it that way. The guy just represents you, so you've gotta pay for it? When it's over, they'll reimburse me. Yeah, the university's reputation is the board's responsibility. This is their crisis. They need to hire a crisis manager, not us. Yeah. What the hell is that? We're here for them. You don't leave 'em hanging. - No. Joe! - What? A hundred reporters. You can't march out. I should go. No, I'll do it. Joe Paterno! Joe Paterno! - This is their home. - They expect us to camp. Step back, man! Joe Paterno! - Hey, everybody. - Joe Paterno! Hey, everybody. Thank you very much. Appreciate your support. We really do. Before you go back to cheering, I'll ask you to take a moment and say a prayer for... Scott Paterno! Scott Paterno! Okay, look, look, look. However this works out... Scott Paterno! Guys, however this works out... This is a terrible story involving a lot of kids, okay? - And they need our support too! - Scott Paterno! - A prayer for the kids, okay? - Scott Paterno! I appreciate it. I really appreciate it. Guys, if you could just listen to me for one second! That's great, guys. I got three kids, okay? - This is a huge... - Scott Paterno! - All right, guys. Thank you. - Scott Paterno! Scott Paterno! Scott, is Joe gonna speak up... Wow, so effective. Fuck you, Jay. - Oh, Scott, for heaven's sakes. - You can't just shut 'em off. - Joe could. - Joe's not goin' out there. Scott Paterno! Call him. Hi. Dan McGinn, please? It's Mary Kay Paterno. We saw the CNN interview, Sara. What kind of bullshit was that? Football programs - make millions of dollars... - Billions. They make billions of dollars every year off football players. But JoePa was the only one who ever said, these are scholars, they're here to learn how to become men. That's the guy you want to shit on? Like it's his fault that Jerry's a queen. I have to believe you know the difference between a gay man and a pedophile. Are you calling me a faggot? Whether you're a faggot has nothing to do with the act of a child abuser. If you're friend calls me a fuckin' faggot one more time, - I'm gonna lose my shit. - Homosexuality is legal. Who are you even talking to? JoePa made an ethos in this whole place. Like, it fucking mattered that you got an education because you're about more than just yourself. You're a school, and you fight for something together. - She went to the school. - Yeah? She learn anything? On your way down, think about getting up. Don't be afraid to lose. The team that makes fewer mistakes wins. Cut your hair, wear a tie... - That's literally all JoePa. - She knows that. You know why you read Virgil in the original? To gain a nuanced understanding of coded language. So when one of your guys says that something fishy went down, in the locker room, in the shower, with a 10-year-old, you get the fucking gist. She makes money by telling lies. She doesn't have a good lie, she doesn't get a good paycheck. It must not be a good lie, 'cause it's a tiny fuckin' paycheck. What have I... Liability problem. What is that? Who could've stopped it, and didn't? Some of it's just lying, some just people hearing and not believing it... Is she gonna be on the Davis call? Yep. We need to be on the phone with Lanny Davis at 4:00. Bill Clinton's lawyer. He's representing Penn State. - Holy shit. - He's gonna scream a lot, and threaten to sue the paper into the ground. Can he do that? Who knew about 1998? The cops. Gary Schultz. He says he told Spanier, Spanier said he didn't. What's the likelihood Schultz knew and didn't tell Tim Curley and JoePa? Nobody take a shit around there without asking JoePa for tactical advice, so... But he says no. The kid he raped at the Alamo Bowl? That was '99, but I don't think he told anybody - before the investigation. - 2000? A janitor sees Jerry pin a boy to a wall, blow him, but only tells another janitor who's scared shitless of Joe, thinks he's gonna get fired, so no report. 2001? 2001, everybody knew, but they called it nothing. Horsing around in a locker room. Who? Who uses those words? Spanier said he heard it was conduct that made somebody uncomfortable. McQueary. - That's what McQueary told him? - No, he never talked to McQueary. Who met with McQueary? Paterno, Schultz, Curley. How do they describe it? They described it as inappropriate conduct, horsing around, not that serious. And what about JoePa? He said that McQueary saw something of a sexual nature. What does Joe consider sexual? I don't know. What did McQueary say? McQueary said what he saw. The kid against the wall, Jerry behind him. - Rhythmic sounds. - Anal rape. Probably, but I don't know if he said those words. He was trying to communicate anal rape, not snapping towels. Well, I know that, I just don't know if we're on solid ground to say that. I don't know if he said that to Joe. Are we having a role reversal here? You choose your words and your reality. How many people used words that allowed other people to understand crimes against children as what knuckleheads do in locker rooms? We're in this too. Your first article's the reason a bunch of these victims came forward. There's no case without that. You think I don't wanna use the strongest possible language? But when Bill Clinton's lawyer calls you... I'll deal with that. He is the soul of the university. Anybody in this town will tell you that. We built the library, and he quintupled the endowment. - $2 billion. - This was a cow college. They wanted a school with a good football team. But Joe always said that they should be a world-class academic institution. - It's not a farm team for the NFL. - It's a philosophy. - Like the dorms. - Would not allow an athletic dormitory... Show him the Why I hate Jerry Sandusky memo. I don't know what this is. What do you think? If there was a reason to fire Jerry, he would have found it. Okay, stop talking about me like I'm dead, please. I'm here. The press is here. Kids are shouting on the lawn. Everybody wants to know what I have to say. So, it's time to say it. And what exactly do you want them to know? A tragedy happened. I did exactly what I was supposed to do as soon as I knew. End of story. Did other people know? I don't know. Did I know about rumors? Who remembers? I don't know what I had for breakfast. Sir... Point is, it's time to focus on helping the university, not talking about Joe Paterno. It's... What do... It's got nothing to do with me, truly. What does it have to do with me? Coach, I have so much respect for you. I followed your career for a long time. That's why I took the case. This is the bad part of my job. You need to step down. You need to retire... and announce it right away. Okay, wait, wait... Hold on... I want to know, from you, what not to say to the press. That's why you're here. I don't need career advice. Dan, we asked you to craft a message for the press. That's it. This isn't about what he... No. He can't go out there. He's used to being the emperor holding forth in front of a press corps that just watched him win. You're not disciplined enough to go before the press. - That's not true. - He talks in front of the press every day, Mr. McGinn. Ma'am, what I had for breakfast, is what people say when they're worried that they do know, and they're old enough to think that they'll get away with it. I started saying it to my wife when I turned 40. You need to resign before somebody does it for you. You've had a great career. I'm gonna recommend to the board that 2005 be your last season. How old are you, sir? He's 84. I may be 77... - But I'm not old. - Joe. I've raised millions of dollars for this university. I graduate 85% of my players. You wanna fire me, try it. Folks, the question of whether Coach Paterno will retire or be fired is a big part of the public narrative right now. I want you all to think about that. You've had a great career. Coach? A great career. I'm very disappointed in JoePa. To be honest with you, I've looked up to him my whole life. Why would he stick up for a frickin' pedophile? Why would this happen? Help me with this. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Did I see a reverse throwback to the quarterback? Bone right over 42. Pitch reverse pass. Well, don't practice it unless you're gonna use it. - We'll use it. - Yeah. So... Look, guys, this thing has gotten... you know, out of hand, so... I planned to pack it in, end of they year anyway. So... I am absolutely devastated by the developments in this case. I grieve for the children and their families, and I pray for their comfort and relief. I have come to work every day for the last 61 years with one clear goal in mind. To serve the best interests of this university and the young men who have been entrusted to my care. I have the same goal today. That's why I've decided to announce my retirement, effective at the end of this season. I love you all, guys, I really do. I want you to know that we're gonna play the rest of the season together, all right? That's the deal. That's the new deal. There's still a lot of football to play. A lot of interesting things can happen to all of you. I want that for you. So, I want you to focus on that. 'Cause that's all there really is, what we do. The rest of this is just something... I mean, what happened this last week is just... It's not your fault. You had nothin' to do with it. But it makes me feel bad that you had to put up with it. We'll always be Penn State football players. - Yes, sir. - Yep. Always, till the day we die... I wish I could've done more for those kids. Can't say that. It's an admission of guilt. Well, is there any human person looking at this doesn't wish they could've done something more? You're gonna be misquoted. I'm gonna be gone. Dawn? - Hi. - Hi. I'm so sorry. Aaron tried to call me, and I was right... I know. There was a problem at school, and... We're not talking to any other reporters. They all want to, but we said no to everyone but you. You get that, right? I know. I know, and I cannot tell you how much I appreciate that. Do you wanna talk to Mike, Aaron's psychologist? I mean, yeah. That would be great. Would Aaron be okay with that? I'm driving down there tonight and I could meet with him tomorrow. Yeah. Aaron says it's okay. Penn State football coach Joe Paterno will retire, but tonight everyone is taking sides on what he asked in return to coach four more games. The poll conducted on ESPN suggested that 61% of the people out there think he should be allowed that opportunity. If you ask people who are not sports fans, you might get a very different result. Joe? - Come on, Joe. - Yeah. Come on, hon. Let's go to bed. - I... - Yeah? Yes, I'm still home. That's enough work for one day. Come on, let's go. I think... Hip is acting up again. - Oh, it is? - See that? - Oh, man. - I'll give you a rub. They say that's the good... The best operation you can get. A rub? No, a hip replacement, yeah. You're not there yet. - What's that? - What is that? I don't know. - I'll get it. - Okay. - Who callin' at this time? - I don't know. - Yeah? - Hey, Joe. - Hey, Frank. - Sorry to come here so late. - That's all right. - This is for you. They'd like you to call him. Call him? Yeah, thank you. Well, the board of trustees is holding an emergency meeting and there's a lot of speculation here on the future of university president Graham Spanier. Will he resign? Will the board ask him to step down? Yeah, it's Joe Paterno. What? They fired me. - What? - Yeah, effective immediately. - Joe. - Yeah. Joe, give me that phone. Let me have that phone. Hello? After 61 years, he deserved better. The indictment of Jerry Sandusky, the board... Hey, listen. Penn State's board of trustees, tonight, decided that it is in the best interests of the university to have a change in leadership to deal with the difficult issues that we are facing. The board of trustees and Graham Spanier have decided that, effective immediately, Dr. Spanier is no longer president of the university. In addition, Joe Paterno is no longer the head football coach. What? Take that motherfucker down! Joe Paterno is Penn State! They fired him with a phone call. After 45 years. You know, who the hell does that? He didn't give a shit about winning. He fuckin' won anyway. It's a motherfuckin' travesty. Get off his fuckin' lawn. We want Joe! We want Joe! We want Joe! We want Joe! We want Joe! Joe Paterno! You're great, you guys. You guys are great. And let me tell you this... You know what I say, guys... You know, I mean girls too... We love you, Joe! Listen. You gotta... You gotta study now, all right? You gotta get a good night's sleep so you can study. We still got things to do. I'm out of it now, maybe, that phone call put me out of it, but we're gonna go from here, okay? We're gonna go from here. You know, because things have ways... They have ways of working out. We want Joe! One more day! We don't know what's gonna happen ever. Right? And the same with you. So, take care of yourselves. It's important you do that. Right? All right. You're gonna be fine. Yeah. Yeah. Good luck to you all, but listen to me just a second. I thank you for coming. Pray a little bit for the... for those victims, okay? We'll do that. - Joe! Joe! - We love you! We are Penn State! We are Penn State! Penn State! Penn State! We are Penn State! We want Joe! We want Joe! We want Joe! Excuse me! Can I ask you any questions? We want Joe! We want Joe! We want Joe! What did you think about what happened to JoePa? Kids got abused and he didn't tell the police. You go to jail for that. - Let's go! - Can I... Can I maybe quote you on that? No! I don't want to get fucking killed in my bed! The vice president of the school knew about it in 1998. Heard about it twice. You hear it twice and you don't hang the guy, you're just an... hole. Joe heard about it in 2001. He reported it immediately. But we're definitely telling Second Mile, right? - Yeah. - And the Child Welfare thing, we're just playing it by ear, and Graham's okay with that? Well, Graham says the only downside is if Jerry doesn't get it and this happens again. Then we're vulnerable for not having reported it. But we can deal with that down the road. Joe's fine with that. - Paterno? - Yeah. But he doesn't know about the last time, the thing from '98. Yeah, of course he knows. I sat down with him when it happened. He was all over me about it. You sat down with him when it happened? He wanted constant updates. You ever keep Paterno waiting on anything? He's like a woodpecker. We want Joe! We want Joe! We want Joe! Tim, if Joe knows this is the second incident... And you're sure? Look, I've got emails up one side and down the other. Yes. I don't know. Gary. If we need to report it, we'll report it. But we start with sitting down and talking to Jerry like a person. Joe's fine with that. - Okay? - Yeah. Yeah, fine. Sit tight, and this is gonna get taken care of. What do they do first? They protect themselves first, try to sweep it under the rug. That's one thing the Catholic Church and Penn State have in common. Joe's not the one who should be taking the fall for this. It's fuckin' Jerry. Get the fuck off JoePa. It's the media who singled out Joe Paterno. They made him look like a fuckin' villain! You call him a legend, then treat him like a legend. Here's a man that was told that a 10-year-old boy was being sodomized in his backyard, and did nothing about it. He has done so much for this university, and within the past four days, everything we knew of Joe Paterno - has been ripped away from us... - And rightfully so! He's as much of an animal as the guy that did the act. Are you kidding me? How stupid do you have to be to go ahead and protest over taking down a ring of child abusers? Are you serious? A few years ago, we had no idea and it was a great football program. A few years ago, you had several kids getting raped. You guys have been brainwashed by that school. It's nothing but a cult... This has football written all over it! He did exactly the right thing. If he had done any more, he would have been criticized for that... Fuck the media! Fuck the media! Fuck the media! Fuck the media! Fuck the media! We want Joe! We want Joe! We want Joe! We want Joe! Good morning to you. It was really a wild night. It all started after students here learned that Joe Paterno had been fired. Think it was a witch hunt, and everybody got what they wanted. Back in 1998, this should've and could've stopped. It almost makes Paterno look like a fraud for everything he always stood for. And that's what he has now opened himself up for because he always had the moral superiority. Right. Hey, guys, guys, can you just back off the car? One question, was your father fired because he didn't tell the grand jury everything he knew? We don't have an answer for... Jerry was caught with Victim Six in your locker room, - you really didn't know... - Guys. Guys! Will you, out of respect for the children... That's why we're here, the kids. No, I... All right, your kids. Sorry. Didn't see them there. Sorry. Thanks, man. Okay, guys. Come on. Just go straight up to see Grandpa, all right? Come on. Just go straight up. I'm gonna get canned. Bradley wants me to come talk to him. I don't think they're gonna fire you. Why? It's a witch hunt. If they go for you, there's no reason they won't go for me. The board of trustees wants to make this all about us. And football. 'Cause if they don't, it'd have to be about Second Mile, where the guy actually worked. So who's gonna be left holding the bag if they can't blame it on us? I don't know, ya know? Dad, what exactly did you say? McQueary came to me, and he told me what he told me. First time I ever heard anything like this. So... I knew I couldn't handle it, so I went... What am I gonna do? Go runnin' with some things I don't know are true? So I went to Tim, and Gary. Why them? I didn't see it, Jay. I didn't see it. Tim and Gary are all right, I mean, they... Ya know? Capable people. You know, the best thing about this job is the young people you get to work with. You see 'em come up as young kids and mature. See 'em grow up, overcome some adversity, have some success. They turn out to be good people. They come back and say... Hey, Coach. It was so great being a Penn State football player. Yeah. My name... I spent my whole life trying to make that name mean something. And it's gone now. Aaron came forward three years ago, in this office, after his school told him not to report it because Jerry Sandusky had a heart of gold. We contacted the police that day, and usually cases like this it takes a week, maybe a month, to get an arrest. This took three years of waiting, of a scared boy telling a horror story, to me, to a trooper, to two other troopers, to two other new troopers, a grand jury, then a second grand jury, and a third. Still no arrest. He suffered from panic attacks, insomnia, conversion syndrome. I don't recall how often or how many times he tried to kill himself. Attorney generals have looked him in the eye, in the eye, and said, we're gonna arrest this monster next week. Then more months would go by, and then more months would go by. Three years he stuck with this because he didn't wanna see another kid get hurt. What do you think about the Paterno situation? I honestly don't know why anybody's talking about Joe Paterno. Somebody six months from retirement failed to see the big picture and didn't vigorously protect children? Of course you goddamn fire him. It's spectacularly unworthy of conversation. I'm sorry. A crime against children happened. Why the heck is anyone talking about Joe Paterno? Coaches on the same staff for 32 years... Coaching staffs who've spent so much time together in a room, in the dark, with the film on, and talkin', and... These guys are all close. Know what he's gonna do? He's not going to prop his feet up. He's gonna go help young people in a program that he started... What's this? Alamo Bowl. When was that? Everybody wants dates. I don't know. Before he retired. '99, maybe. Which one is New Orleans? - What? - Which bowl? Sugar Bowl. That was in the '70s a couple times. Yeah. He went in the pool with the kids at the Bowl games in New Orleans and Miami. - Who? Jerry did? - Yeah. Well, you didn't like to go in the pool, remember? I mean, you were working, on a towel, and I went in with them. But I don't throw the kids up in the air. The dads do that. And they... they scream. They just love that. What? Our kids? Yeah. I didn't do that with our kids. Jerry did. What are you saying? I'm saying you couldn't have known. Otherwise you wouldn't have let them go in the pool, right? I had a job to do. I was working. I wasn't focused on the goddamn pool. For decades, Penn State represented what was best about college athletics. For the past week, it has reflected what is often worst about human beings. And today, for the first time since late 1965, Joe Paterno will not be the head coach, and those in Beaver Stadium hope that they can aid, in some small way, in the healing process. Penn State and Nebraska. From University Park, Dave Pasch will have the call. And the Nebraska and Penn State players, currently sharing the sentiments of many around the nation, gathering in prayer for the victims of these aberrations to show their solidarity and support. And obviously, an emotional day for many reasons. A lot of Joe Paterno fans. Paterno was to pass Amos Alonzo Stagg today for most games coached in Division I. It's been a week nobody could've imagined here, Dave, at State College, the reach and scope of all that has happened... Penn State! Penn State! Penn State! Penn State! It's been such an emotional week for the Paterno family, this morning Jay Paterno went by early to see his parents, Joe and Sue. Fearful that he might not be able to contain the emotions, he wrote a letter, but he asked that his parents not read that letter while he was there at the house. Please read it later, after I leave, Dad, is what he told Joe. A letter to be read, basically giving him the message of what he means to him, what this day means to him. Martinez keeping, and then pitching it the last second, and Burkhead is in... Touchdown, Nebraska! And Nebraska has opened up a 17-0 lead. We hear in the background chants from the student section for JoePa... The Paternos must be a letter-writing family. Matt McGloin told me that Joe Paterno sent a letter to the players, a short note, and in that letter it said that he was heartbroken, sorry he couldn't be with them but he wanted them to focus on this game and not on him. Dave? And McGloin fumbled the ball! As McGloin makes the catch! Touchdown! Two scores in five minutes and Penn State is back within three, with the football. There's always Joe Paterno on what to do here, whether to go on fourth-and-one. Penn State, down three, will go. McGloin gets the play off, this'll be the final play. McGloin running around... And it's incomplete. Nebraska wins! - Roll for me, Charlie. - Right. The D came out in nickel, stacked the strong side. The O-line got no push. What is that? Hey, Dad? Listen, I talked to Merrick. The Big Ten wants to change the name on the trophy. What? The Stagg-Paterno Trophy? - What the hell they gonna call it? - I don't know. I think we call Jim Delany and talk him down. - It's a panic move. - No, no... - Dan McGinn should call. - Yeah, you're right. They're not gonna announce till Monday. If we get to Delany today, then it'll be fine. - Stop. - This is not where we stop. This is where we fight. This is where it starts. - We're in the fight of our lives... - Stop. Stop! No more. No more... He went in the pool with the kids at Bowl games. Our kids? You couldn't have known. Otherwise you wouldn't have let them go in the pool. I was working. I wasn't focused on the goddamn pool. Joe! Joe, get in the pool. Go play with Jay! Dad, come get in the pool. Come here, Dad. Joe, get in the pool! Go play with Jay. Dad. Come here, Dad. Joe! - Come here, Dad! - Joe! Oh, my... It's a small-cell carcinoma in the left lung, and it looks like it's metastasized, which... It's not what we want to see. We're gonna go at it with all we've got. That means chemotherapy, and then, of course, with radiation. But given the bronchitis you've got now, your broken pelvis, and your age... - Don't you touch me. - Get the fuck out of here! - This is wrong. - You're wrong, pal. Everybody's got an opinion. What makes yours special? Get out of here. Get the fuck out of here. Sara Ganim. Hello? Hi. Hi. Who is this? Do I have to say right now? No? Whatever's comfortable. My lawyer said I should call you. I... - I grew up in State College. - Okay. Jerry Sandusky... Yeah... There are a lot of people who have gone through this. - I'm sure you know that. - Yeah. Have you talked to anyone about this? Well, the lawyer and... I talked to Joe. Joe... Joe Paterno? We didn't really talk about it. He said that Jerry's a good man, and I shouldn't talk that way about a good man. That was pretty much it. Okay. And... Do you... Do you remember when exactly it was that this all took place? Yeah. It was in summer. In 1976. I'm sorry. You said 1976?
