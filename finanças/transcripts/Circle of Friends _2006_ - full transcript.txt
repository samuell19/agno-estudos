[ Sobbing ] - No! No! You don't have to do this! [Sobbing]: No! Please! Don't do this, please! [ Screaming ] [ Sobbing ] No, please! Please! No, please! [ Gunshot ] - Celia? You were our touchstone. The glue that held us together. We don't work without you! You organized all the trips. You remembered all the birthdays! You taught us the latest dances. You even taught us how to perm our hair! - And now you're not gonna be here to teach us how to grow old with grace. - I think we should take a moment... ...and ask the universe to protect her, and help her find peace. - And help us understand why she would do this. Why she would take her own life. Sorry I missed the service. My plane took off an hour late. - It's OK. You're here now. That's what matters. - Joan! - Hi. - So glad you came, Maggie. - Did she leave a note or something? - No, no. They didn't find anything. - How come nobody saw this coming? - Oh, you know Celia. No matter what she was feeling on the inside, she always showed that cheery face to the outside world. - But we aren't supposed to be the outside world to each other. - I know, let's face it. We're not the same naiïve little group we were in high school. Life got in the way. - We're all so preoccupied with our own lives, we never even saw how much pain she was in! - I've been so wrapped up in my own world, I hadn't talked to her in... forever. - It wouldn't have made a difference. We were here, and she didn't reach out to us. - Well, some of us have been pretty busy lately, flying around the state. - Well, I tried to talk to her. I swear I did. - It's hard to imagine the girl who grew up over the hardware store moving into the governor's mansion! - Get used to it, Maggie! Andrew's way ahead in the polls. - I'm really excited for you, Susan. - Enough to design me a gorgeous gown? - We just buried one of our best friends. You think we could deal with your fashion issues later? - Can we please be kind to one another? On today, of all days? - I would have loved to have had you stay with us, but with all the renovations, the place is like a war zone. - No, this is great. It's very sweet of your parents to let me stay here while they're in Europe. - Well, of all the girls, you were always their favourite. OK. Oh, sorry. I didn't have time to get to the market. - Feels like yesterday when we used to sit around here, stuffing our faces with ice cream and talking about who was dating who. - It was a good time, wasn't it? - It sure was. So, how you been doing? - Oh, I've been well, you know, really well. Well, other than today, that is. - Sure. And how's Steve? - Oh, he's doing fine. And the kids are, well, kids. - Oh, wow. They must be so big now. - Oh yeah, they're a handful, all right. - And Harry? How's Harry? - My brother? Oh, you know, he's good. He's really working hard. - So what have you been doing with yourself lately? - Oh, not much, really. You know, mostly mom things, wife things. You know, carpools, soccer games, dinner parties. - Well, I'm glad to hear you're doing well. - Yeah. OK. Um, there are fresh linens on your bed, towels in the bathroom. Here are the keys, the alarm code, and the emergency numbers. OK? - Tell your parents I appreciate this. - Are you sure you won't come for dinner? It's pizza night! - It sounds tempting, but I'm so beat, I think I'll curl up in bed with a book and a hot cup of tea. - Life in the fast lane, huh? Sleep tight. [ Door opening ] [ Door closing ] [ Keys rattling ] [ Clatter ] [ Clatter ] [ Water running ] - Ah! Hey! - Harry! - You damn near scalded me half to death. - What the hell are you doing here? - Last time I looked, this was still my parents' house. - So what, you just decided to drop by and take a shower? - Actually, my hot water heater blew up, so this seemed like a good idea. - Didn't Joan tell you I was staying here? - Well... - Oh! You sneaky bastard. You could have called! - Great to see you again, Mags! AAHH! Dammit! - I wasn't surprised you married Lois. She was always madly in love with you. - [Chuckling]: Only at first. Then she got to know the real me. - Oh, I don't believe that. You guys were together for quite a while. - Yeah. There were good times at first. It just hadn't worked for a really long time. I just couldn't deal with the idea of divorce, but... Joan told me that you and Richard had a really good marriage. - We did. Maybe it was because we were friends for so long before we ever went out on a date. Whatever it was... It worked. - I'm glad. - Your letter meant a lot to me, Harry. It was so shocking, losing Richard like that. - He was really a good guy. - Yeah. They said he had been drinking. I don't know how he lost control of that car, but I know he wasn't drinking. - Did they find any alcohol in his system? - No. His car went up in flames. There wasn't... much left of him. I just couldn't write you back, Harry. It was too hard. - I know. So how long you sticking around? - A few days, if I can. It's been so long since I've been here, it's actually nice to be back. - I'm glad to hear that. - Mmm. You do plan on fixing that water heater, don't you? [ Chuckling ] - It all depends. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Look at that defiant little smile. Even then, Celia had such spirit. This was taken the day she made us swear our blood oath to always be there for one another. - The things you do at 10. - Let me see? - My God, where did you find that photo? - I never throw anything out! I still have my Girl Scout uniform. - Hey, do you guys remember when Celia's bike went missing, and she made us sneak into every back yard in the neighbourhood to find it? Righteous indignation, even in the 4th grade. - That girl, Mandy? Oh, she was sorry she picked Celia's bike to steal. She's been shell- shocked for years! [ All chuckling ] - The truth is, we were always Celia's back-up team. She was Nancy Drew. - Always a detective. - You know, Mandy comes to my yoga studio. She still can't look me in the eye. - I'm so proud you've turned all those years of the Downward Dog into your own business! - Show-off! [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? What do you mean, he got out? You were supposed to watch him! He gets terrified when he can't find his way home! - Fred, her cat. There's always a drama. - That's why I hired you to babysit! Please go find him. And call me when you do. I don't care how neurotic it sounds. He gets upset when he's left alone! - Shh, it's OK. We'll tell that to the men in the white coats when they come to get you. - That's your problem. You don't care about anyone but yourself. - Just because I don't want the responsibility of a pet doesn't make me selfish. - Oh, no, admit it. You were always lousy with pets. Remember when she tried earning extra money in college babysitting pets? [ All laughing ] - Oh God, that poor girl downstairs. I forget her name, but her cat was a zombie after spending a day with you. - Nancy Harrison. That was her name. - That's right! She had curly dark hair, and the high- pitched little laugh. - Yeah. She died a few months ago, you know? There was a fire at her vacation cabin. - Oh my God! That's horrible. ♪ Rock song on radio ♪ Whistling along I didn't think news directors got to take a day off. - Well, I made sure nothing newsworthy would happen today. - Well, I think a picnic lunch is a great idea. [ Phone ringing ] - What's up? What kind of accident? - What is it? - OK. I'm on my way. There's been some kind of explosion. I'm afraid I have to go check it out. - Well, I'll take a rain check if you let me tag along. - All right. - Whoa, Johnny, be careful over there, huh? - Hey, Bobby, what's up? - The neighbours heard a big bang. Saw the garage on fire, roof blown clear off. The police think it was a gas leak. - Anybody inside? - Yeah, it was a man in his early thirties. His name is Burt Sheffield. He was alone. Apparently, his wife was visiting her sister. - God, poor woman. - I'll see if I can get a statement from the coroner. - Thanks, Bobby. - Didn't we go to school with a Burt Sheffield? - Maybe. I'm not really good with names. - He was a tall, blond kid. Very good at sports. - Tennis. Yeah, he played tennis. - Yeah, that's it. I think he was in our class. Here he is. Burt Sheffield, class of '92. "Voted most likely to win the US Open "before reaching legal drinking age." - Didn't he ask you out one time? - Yeah. I went to watch him in the state finals. He was sweet. - Hey, anyone know what happened to Phil McAuliffe? - My nutritionist said he's teaching at Harvard. - Oh. Bela Morrison? - Oh, she was at Andrew's fundraiser last week. Wearing the ugliest dress. - Michelle Murdoch. - Oh, enough already! God! Did you really have to pull out the yearbook? She's gonna ask about each and every person. You know, I don't remember half of them anyway! - Well, they all knew us. We were a pretty exclusive group! - Yeah, but we were all very friendly. - Speak for yourself. I was a snob. - Is that me? How could you let me go out looking like that? - We tried to stop you, but you were in your preppy stage. - Martha? Susan Jennings. Add Walter Newton's name to the party list. Oh, I suspect he'll be good for a big, fat cheque. Thanks, dear. - Who are you? - Just someone determined to get her husband elected governor. - All right, what about Carol Nash? - Poor thing. She died about 5 years ago. Breast cancer. - Give it a rest. - All right. I'm just curious. That's all. I've been here, what, 48 hours, and I've heard about 3 people from our high school who've died. - People do die, Maggie. It happens! - I guess so, but... Come on! Three people in 8 months? And if you include my husband's car accident, that's 4 from the same graduating class. - Look, you're finally getting back on your feet, and I... - Go ahead. Say it! Say it! I lost it after Richard's death, and you still think I'm a loose cannon. - I just don't wanna see you getting stressed out! [ Phone ringing ] - Hey, Rodney! What's up? No, I know the awards ceremony is in 5 weeks. Just fax me the sketches, and tell her I'll see her in 2 weeks for a fitting. No, I don't know when I'm coming back yet. No, I haven't moved to Connecticut forever. Bye. What about Martha Patterson? - Maybe it would help if we knew what you were hoping to find. - I don't know. I guess I'm just looking for something they might have in common. Some sort of connection. - What could they possibly have in common? - That's what I intend to find out. I was an assistant to the assistant. And then this new designer came in, Pascal. He was amazing, brilliant. He saw some of my designs, he liked them, and the rest just happened from there! - Well, he sounds like a smart guy. He knew talent. - Yeah, New York is full of talent. I just got lucky. - [Chuckling]: Somehow I doubt that. All those years, I remember you tearing out pictures of dresses in magazines, designing all your clothes. There's no way you ended up anywhere but right where you did. [ Chuckling ] - You know, it's funny. When I used to dream about it back then, I always thought you'd be right there along with me. - So Richard went in my place. He got to marry you. - Oh! - You know, I was angry when you left for New York. - [Chuckling]: Yeah, I know. I guess I was angry with you too, because you wouldn't come with me. - Yeah. I half hoped you'd hate it there, and come back here to live. I knew you wouldn't. - I always wondered what would have happened if I'd fought you harder, and made you come with me. - I guess we each had our own dreams to follow. I had to follow mine, too. - You know, Richard always said that if it wasn't him, he'd want me to be with you. 'Cause you make me happy. - He said that? - Mm-hmm. And Richard believed in first loves. I was his first love, and he knew you were mine. - And you were mine. - [ Maggie]: To the gang being together again. - Well, almost the whole gang. - You know, it took Celia's death to make me realize how happy I am to have you all in my life. - Is that why you went by the high school today? - What, are you having me followed? - It's a small town. - Yes. Yes, I stopped by to see Principal Dunn on my way here. - He said he was gonna look into anything the 4 of them might have had in common back in school that could connect them. - I can't believe you're doing this. - Well, I can't believe that none of you think it's strange that in a small town like this, a group of people, who all happen to be in our class, have been dying lately. - Maggie? Do you see that guy over there? - Yeah? - That's Nancy Harrison's husband. Why don't you go talk to him? He's a prominent lawyer. I don't think he'd just sit by if he thought there was anything suspicious about his wife's death. - Don't say it that way! You make me sound like I'm crazy! OK. I will. - I'm starting to worry about her. - She'll run out of steam soon. - I wouldn't bet on it. She's as stubborn as an ass. Always has been. - He said he doesn't know of any connection between Nancy and any of the people that died. He said she never even mentioned their names. - And they were together a long time. - Ten years. - Did he say anything else? - Yeah. He said allowing yourself to move on is the hardest part of grieving. - He's right. All the books say that. - Is any of this because of my brother? - No, absolutely not. - Wait a minute. Are you seeing Harry again? - We're just friends. - That's what you said in 10th grade. I didn't believe you then, I don't believe you now. - Why didn't you tell us? - I would have, but there's nothing to tell! - Mm-hmm. - Hey, how about we hit some of the new shops downtown tomorrow? - I told Celia's mother I'd start packing up her place. She just can't face doing it herself. - I'd love to go with you. - Oh, God! Packing away her things. - Yeah. - I don't think I could handle it. - "And on that cheek, and on that brow, "so soft, so calm, yet eloquent, "the smiles that win, the tints that glow, "but tell of days in goodness spent." - [Both]: "A mind at peace with all below below, "a heart whose love is innocent." - Mmm. I think that's when I first fell in love with you. - When? - Byron. I used to love when you'd read poetry to me. - Yeah, Byron. My wingman. [ Both chuckling ] Mags...

[ Chuckling ] - It's not exactly high praise. - Oh, it's just, it's difficult, that's all. - Of course it is. - I know it's silly, but I feel like I'm cheating on Richard. - No, it's not silly at all. - I know Richard would want me to go on with my life. I mean, I have to go on with my life. It's just-- - Hey. We'll take things as slowly as you need to. I promise. - Of course you do. - Well... maybe starting tomorrow. [ Both chuckling ] - It's so strange to be going through her things like this. - I know. It feels like we're trespassing. - I feel like a snoop. - Hey! Do you remember this? - Yeah. She knitted an identical one for each of us. I still have mine. - The summer we were 13. Cranberry and yellow, our club colours. [ Both chuckling ] - Are you quitting on me already? - No. But since we're snooping, I might as well get to know her again. Who she was last week, last month. I missed out on that girl. [ Laughing ] No one but Celia looks good in a driver's licence photo. Hey. Hey, listen to what she wrote. "Nancy - fire, Richard - car." "Cousin Laura" crossed out. "Linda," question mark. "Pam, Burt. "Rob West, East, Joker is Wild." - That's the name of the people who've died! - Yeah, and then some. - What's the printing on the back? - It's an ATM receipt. Dated 10 days ago. So you still think I'm crazy? - So what do you think she meant by "Cousin Laura" and "Linda"? - It must mean something. Celia was an English teacher. She was very precise with words. - There's one name she didn't put on that list. Her own. - I don't like this. I think you have to go to the police. - And tell them what? They'll say I'm grieving, just like the rest of you did! I can't call the police until I have something more solid. - Hey, hey, hey! Slow down! Say hello to Aunt Maggie. - Where's the juice?- On the door. - Hi, Aunt Maggie. - Now, wash your hands, 'cause lunch is almost ready. - You know, I'm supposed to leave after Andrew's rally, but I'm thinking of sticking around a while longer. Will your parents mind? - I think they'll be fine. Especially if Harry asks them nicely. Do I need to worry about you two? - Is there any way I can stop you? - Hmm. I could ask you the same thing. [ Scoffing ] [ Applause ] - What an amazing night. My wife Susan and I would like to thank Sharon for hosting this lovely party. And we appreciate all of you coming out here tonight, to support us with your kind wishes and your chequebooks. [ All laughing ] We sincerely hope that our next little get-together will be at the governor's mansion! - Look at her! She's as smooth as that silk dress. - It's hard to remember she was once a shy little girl in hand-me-down clothes. - She's come a long way. I'm proud of her. I'm proud of all of us. It's a shame Steve couldn't join us tonight. I was really looking forward to seeing him! - Yeah, he's on call at the hospital. They had an emergency. - Here they come! - Maggie! - Oh, Andrew! - Seeing you is the highlight of my night. - Take it easy, darling! She's not even a voter in this state. - When it comes to my old friends, I don't discriminate. How come everybody else can spend time with you except me? - I know! What else could you possibly be busy with? You know, Andrew, I have to say, I am very impressed. And I predict a landslide! - Thank you, Maggie. - And it's about time we get a sharp dresser running the show! - Well, since you brought it up, I do have a small favour to ask you. - Oh, you fell right into that one. - How about organizing a fundraiser for me? A fashion show, to raise money for the final campaign blitz. - It was all his idea, I swear! - It would be my pleasure. Richard. Celia. Burt Sheffield. Nancy Harrison. [ Dialling ] Joan. I found it. The thing that connects them all, all 4 of them. I'll explain when you come to pick me up. I'm at Celia's house. I think we need to go to the police. - It'll never happen. I'll see to it. I know all about you! And when I'm done, so will everyone else. - How many of these people did you say are dead? - Four, Bill. - In what period of time? - Eight months. That just can't be a coincidence! - Why do you say that? - A car crash, a fire, suicide, gas leak. They're all violent deaths! - Yeah, but all the incidents were investigated, and there was no sign of foul play. - I suppose, but I'm not so sure how thoroughly they were investigated! - I see. When was this picture taken? - Back in high school, about 15 years ago. - Here. Maggie, I'd love to help an old friend. But don't you think it's a little-- - No, Bill! I don't! - Surely there's no harm in looking into it again. If there's no reason to suspect anything, you'll know it soon enough. We know how thorough you like to be, Bill. - It would really mean a lot to me. - Sure. Yeah, fine. I'll look into it. Even though you did refuse to date me in 10th grade. - I was a silly girl. So what about the guy in the baseball hat? Does he look familiar? - No, I can't see his face. [ Phone ringing ] - Harry! No, it's OK. I wanted to stay in anyway tonight. How 'bout I cook something? OK, I won't cook something. We'll order in. All right. I'll see you later! What? What's that look about? - You won't tell me what's going on? - There's nothing to tell. - But you're seeing him every night. - We're old friends. - You're old lovers. And I just don't wanna see anyone get hurt! Especially my brother. - No one's gonna get hurt. - Harry had a hard time after you left. And we both know you're gonna leave again. - We're taking it slowly. That's all there is to say. So what about the girl with the ponytail? - I don't know her. Do you know where this picture was taken? - I don't know. I've never been the outdoorsy type. What about the girl in the green sweater? - Wait, I recognize her! Yeah, that's Pamela Layne. - Pamela? - Mmm. - Pam. Celia's note mentioned a Pam. Do you know if she's still alive? - She's alive, all right. She's Tom's swim coach. Just a sec, I think I've got a picture of her in here somewhere. Yeah, here it is. It was taken at Tom's last swim meet. - Wait, I think I remember her. She was in my Spanish class. I really need to talk to her, find out what she knows about the day this photo was taken. - OK. I'll give her a call. - I don't get where this Pamela woman could be all day. - Joan said she left several messages for her. She'll call. Come on, throw a card! - Gin. - That is 9 in a row! How do you do that? - I'm a natural. - OK. No more Mr. Nice Guy. - Ooh! [ Both chuckling ] - Thanks! [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? Hi, Joan. You just caught me. - Joan's worried about us. She thinks we're headed for trouble. - That's what she keeps telling me. What do you think? - I think there's something very special between us. There always has been. - You know, Harry, we have to face the reality of who we are now. We're not kids out of school anymore. We have lives. Lives that we're entrenched in. Lives that don't exactly mesh. How are we gonna deal with that? - I don't know. I just know I don't wanna lose you again. Not without a fight. And that includes fighting Joan, and you, and reality, and... gin! Yeah! Yes for Harry. - Well... Maybe... we should forget about reality for a bit. - Yeah? - Uh-huh. - [Both]: Mmm... [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? Oh, hey, Joan! No, 8:00 tomorrow morning sounds great. Tell her I'll be there. Thank you. - Mmm... - Pamela will see me tomorrow before she goes to work. - Ah! I told you she'd call. - Mmm... [ Giggling ] - Now... Where were we? [ Giggling ] [ Screaming ] [ Dogs barking ] - Thanks, Rodney. I got the fabric samples, and I'll overnight them the sketches as soon as I take a look at them. [ Siren blaring ] Oh, God! Excuse me! Officer! What happened? Who is that? - Stand back, ma'am. - Her name was Pamela Layne. Such a nice girl. It looks like she fell from her balcony. - I start asking questions about Pamela Layne, and the next day, she turns up dead! - Well, darling, you can't hog all the credit! - Don't patronize me. Do you think this was a coincidence? - There's no such thing. - OK, so what do you think is going on? - What does it look like? - You really believe someone's murdering these people? - And you really believe this was just another accident? - I don't know what to think. - Did you get a hold of him yet? - No, the desk sergeant says he'll be back at 3:00. - Tell him I'll be there then. - OK, Mrs. Dale will be there at 3:00. - Whatever's going on, the answer's gotta be in this photo. I just wish we knew who these other people were. If we could only see their faces better. - I could scan the photo, blow it up on the computer. - Do it. Then we'll go see McDougall again. Anybody else wanna join us at the police? - I've gotta teach a yoga class at 1:00. - There's a rally at 2:00. I promised I'd be there. - Yeah, yeah, I get it. Guess it's just you and me, Joan. - Now, let's see. You called about Pamela Layne. Well... First indications are accidental. - Again? And you're gonna accept that? - I'm not accepting anything. Just looking at a preliminary report. But the investigating officers see no reason to think otherwise. - It's 5 accidents now, Bill! - It's a lot of accidents, I'll give you that, but I don't see the pattern. As far as I can tell, they didn't even know one another. At least not since school. I just don't see the connection. - The connection is the photo I showed you last time! Everybody who's died is in it, and as of last night, that includes Pamela Layne. For God's sakes, Bill! What's it gonna take to get you to re-open these cases? - I'm gonna be completely honest with you. I spoke to NYPD. They said your husband's accident was a single-car crash, that his car left the road for no apparent reason. Their opinion? A strong case can be made for-- - Yeah, driving under the influence. Yeah. Well, they don't know what they're talking about. - Well, they said you'd feel that way. - Look. I knew my husband. They didn't. And they obviously didn't care enough to investigate, and find out what really happened to him! Oh. Oh, I see. I see. They said I was emotional, huh? - Not exactly. Frankly, they said you were a nut! - A nut? Because I wouldn't let them off the hook? - You filed a complaint with the mayor! - Yeah, so what if I did? They were gonna brush it off, file it away! - Let's assume for a minute that Maggie isn't imagining all this. - You told me she had some kind of breakdown! - You did what? - He was asking about your emotional state after Richard's death! - Look, I have to go to a meeting, all right? I'll tell you what, though. I'll take another look into it. I'll do that much. But frankly-- - Yeah, frankly, I was right never to go out with you. Dammit, Joan, you're supposed to be on my side! - He caught me off guard with that question! I didn't know he'd use it against you. Look, look. He did say he'd look into it again. I mean, maybe-- - What, you believe him? - You wanna tell me why you filed a complaint with the mayor? - Not really. - You don't think that was a little extreme? - They said Richard was drinking! - Are you sure he wasn't? He had been at the US Open. You said yourself he had clients there. He could have had a few beers with someone, and-- - Now you agree with them? - No, no. But I just-- I don't know. I wasn't there. And neither were you, Maggie. - I know in my gut that it's not true. Richard didn't drink and drive, ever! Remember when his cousin was killed by that drunk driver? He never got over that! I thought I put it away, made peace with it. But then I come here, and hear about all these other people, and it just brought it all up again. - That's why you have to leave things to Bill. - I don't think Bill is capable of handling anything! - Just give him a chance! - What is that? - My fix. I drop antacid. - You've been taking those like candy lately. What's going on?- Nothing! I'm fine. - Is there something going on with you and Steve? - No, no! Nothing's going on. It's good. Good, you know? Kids are good. - Good! Now give me a real answer. - As much as I love my family, I always thought I'd have more in my life, you know? Like some sort of career, the way you have. - Have you tried doing something part-time? - Yeah, for years. Every morning, before anyone is up, I sit in my kitchen and I write. Short stories. I even wrote a novel once. You could paper a room with the rejection slips. - How come you never told me this before? - Because I wanted a little success first. I just needed a little success! - Success isn't all it's cracked up to be. - You don't understand. You've accomplished something! I'm a failure. - You're not a failure! And nobody gets everything, Joan. It just doesn't work that way! - That's what people always say to a failure. - Yeah, well, right now, with the way my life is, I'd love to have some of what you've got. - How'd it go? - He's a jerk. - That good, huh? What I don't get is, how come only Celia went camping that weekend? We did everything together back then! - We didn't do everything together. - Wasn't that the summer you went to Europe, and I was with my aunt? - Yeah, I guess you're right. Any luck blowing up the picture? - I don't know who some of these people are, but they are definitely bigger. - The guy in the baseball hat. There's something familiar about him. - Look at his arm. I think he's got a tattoo. [ Groaning ] - Don't let anybody tell you campaigning can be fun. Shaking hands with hundreds of strangers. I tell ya, the governor's mansion had better be worth it. What you got there? - A guy with a tattoo. - Didn't one of us date a guy with a tattoo? I remember Celia making jokes about it. - You know you're getting old when you can't remember which one of us dated which guy. - Ozzy. That's what Celia used to call him. Ozzy Osbourne. Yeah, because of the tattoo. - Right, Ozzy. - Bobby Osbourne. That was his name. - Hey, now we're getting somewhere. So where do we find him? - Not around here. His family only lived here about a year or so. - We tried to find him a few years back, Reunion Committee stuff, but nobody knew where he went! - That's why God invented the Internet. Hello? I'm looking for a Bobby Osbourne. Yes. Uh, when do you expect him back? Oh. I see. No, no, it's all right. I think I have the wrong number. Sorry. Well, this Bobby Osbourne is retired, and having hip replacement surgery tomorrow. - That's the third dead end we've hit. - How many more Robert Osbournes are there? - Too many. Even after we eliminate all the ones that are too young or too old. It's getting too late to make any more of these calls. - Well, give me the unlisted numbers. I know some people who might be able to shake them loose. - Mmm... Oh, I could get used to this. - Yeah, well, that's the general idea. But we'll have to pick it up a little later. I gotta get to the station for the 11:00 news. - I hope I don't fall asleep before you get back. - Well, I guess I'll just let you sleep, then! - Don't you dare! [ Both chuckling ] [ Door closing ] [ Ringing ] [ Ringing ] - You're asleep, aren't you? - You've reached the Salingers. Please leave a message and we'll get back to you. [ Beep ] - Hey, Mags. Listen, sorry. I got held at work longer than I expected. Guess I should let you sleep, shouldn't I? All right. I will see you tomorrow. Oh, what the hell. [ Smoke alarm beeping ] [ Coughing ] Maggie! [ Coughing ] Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! Come on, wake up! Mags! Oh, Maggie, come on! - Oh! - Maggie, come on! Breathe in, come on! [ Coughing ] There you go. There you go. Hey! - Oh, God! What happened? [ Coughing ] - It's OK. It's OK. - Now do you believe me? - We checked everything. The doors, the windows. There's no sign of forced entry. Let's just hope the prints SID brings back belong to someone other than you, or your friends. - What if they were wearing gloves? Ever think of that? - You watch too much TV. Look, it's possible that somebody broke in here. But it's also possible that that flue slipped off by itself. Anything's possible. All we can go on is evidence, and until I have some... - Why do I have the feeling you won't do anything about this? - Maybe we should consider something else. - Like what? - Well, for one thing, our police psychologist told me that sometimes people create this kind of thing. A kind of drama, subconsciously, to deal with their grief. - I don't believe this. - I'm just looking at all the possibilities. - Hold on. If I'd gotten here any later, Maggie would be dead right now. - People miscalculate. - I don't usually like to tell people how to do their jobs, but this half-hearted effort just isn't good enough! - Look. Show me something, anything, and I'll take another look. Otherwise, I gotta believe that if somebody got in here, they had to fly down that chimney. - This is scaring me to death. They're coming after you now? - I don't understand. How is it the cops found nothing? - I told you the other day, McDougall's an idiot. How hard do you think he looked? - Maybe he's getting even 'cause you blew him off in school. - He's created his scenario, and he's locked into it. - I think Maggie should get away for a few days. - Emily's right. - What good is that gonna do? Whoever did this can travel. He got to Richard in New York, didn't he? No, I'm staying here until we find him. - Don't be an idiot. You're a dress designer! What do you know about this? Go home. - Please don't yell at me, but are we sure this was a break-in? - What? - This is an old house, and it is quite possible that the flue fell off by itself. What would it hurt to get someone in to take a look? - It's not a bad idea. If nothing else, just to prove that McDougall's wrong. - And we'll do it while you're away. - They're right. Take yourself out of the equation for a few days. It's getting too crazy here. - OK. All right, fine. Rodney's been making noise about needing me back in New York. Desperately, as he puts it. Something about a fashion show I agreed to do for the next governor. - Finally, you're getting your priorities straight! - I'm only going for a few days, and then I'm coming right back. While I'm gone, I need you to find out as much as you can about Bobby Osbourne. He's the only lead we've got left! This is important! - OK. Just go! Come on, get outta here! - OK, I'll call for the train schedule. - I don't know if I like the idea of you going alone. You sure you don't need a bodyguard? - I'll be fine. Rodney will watch out for me. - Rodney? - There's nothing to worry about. Rodney, these are great. I can't believe you pulled it together so quickly. - I'm sorry. Don't change the subject. How can you stand there gabbing about sketches after you just told me somebody tried to kill you? - I like the distraction. Besides, I don't wanna admit I'm scared. - Well then, sweetie, get the hell out of there, and come and join us in the relative safety of New York City. - I will. Soon. - Oh! I see. So you're willing to stay in a place where you're obviously in danger. Could this have anything to do with that old flame of yours? - No. - OK, do you wanna try that again, 'cause you had a little piece of drool hanging off your lip. - OK, maybe a little. - Mm-hmm. And? - And what? - And spill it! I wanna know everything! But for now, I'll settle for the headlines. - The headlines are: I like him. - Mm-hmm. - It's like the old days, only better. It's comfortable. Like fitting into an old shoe. - An old shoe? Is that supposed to be a good thing? [ Chuckling ] - It is. Especially if it's a designer shoe. - Ah! - Oh! Hey, don't look at me like that. That's all you're getting out of me. - Honey, I haven't even started yet. When are you coming back? I know she's a size zero, but her ego's like a size 47-D. [ Chuckling ] - How 'bout dinner tonight? My treat. - Oh, sweetie, I can't. Jeremy's cooking tonight. Hey, why don't you come join us? Have dinner. It'll be fun! Oh, come on! He's gotten much better since last time. - Wait, what is this? - Oh, The Joker is Wild. That's a comedy club on 6th and 14th. I went there once. Of course, I thought it would be something very different. - Oh my God! - What is it? - Rob West! East! - What are you talking about? - Uh, it's a long story. - Everything all right? - Yeah. I'll explain later. Taxi! - All right, well, call me. - You said 6th and 14th? - Yeah. No, don't call me. Text me. - OK.- Be careful! I love you. Kisses! Bye. - They go back into the car. They're ripping the things out! They're taking a leak inside the guy's car! They look out, he's almost having an aneurysm, this guy! He's on the ground! He's laughing so hard, he's shaking! They say: "What the hell is wrong with you?" The guy says: "While you guys were trashing my car, "I stepped out of the circle 3 times." [ All laughing ] Ladies and gentlemen, I'm West, he's East, and we'll be back very soon. We're gonna take a short break. Hey. - Rob West? - Who wants to know? - I'm Maggie Dale. - Well, very nice to meet you, Maggie Dale. What'll you have? - Just water, please. - OK! Can I get a beer and a water, please. Thanks, man. So, what'd you think of the show? - I'm sorry, I missed it. - Oh. - I actually came to ask you a question. - Whatever it is, the answer is yes. - Do you know a woman by the name of Celia Waters? - Uh, Celia-- yeah, I used to know a Celia Waters. I mean, that was a long time ago. - That's what I hoped for. - Um, please! What did you say your name was again? - Maggie Dale. It used to be-- - Russell, right? Maggie Russell! We went to high school together! - We did? - My name was Bobby Osbourne back then. Yeah. I guess I wasn't really in what you'd consider the in crowd, but I remember you. And your friends, yeah. Celia was actually the only one who ever treated me nice. How is she? - She's dead. - I'm very sorry to hear that. - They say she committed suicide. Look, um, Celia's not the only person from our school to die lately. Four others have had violent deaths in the past few months. Now, I found this photograph in Celia's belongings. Everybody who's dead is in it. And you're in it, too. - What the hell are you saying? - I don't know. Maybe if you could tell me everything you remember about the day the photo was taken. Where you were, who was there. - We were camping and drinking. I'm sorry, but I don't really remember much about that, so-- - This is important. If someone is killing people, you could be in danger too! - OK, if that's the case, then why are you here? Why not the police? - I've been talking with them. - I see. This is your little investigation, right? I'm sorry I can't be more help, but I have to warm up for the next show, so it was nice seeing you again, Maggie Russell. Goodnight! [ Door closing ] - Richard. [ Phone ringing ] Hello? Oh! Hey, Harry! No. No, I'm just... trying to figure out what I'm gonna have for dinner. [Chuckling]: Uh-huh. Yeah, pizza sounds great. But do you deliver long-distance? Mushroom and pepperoni! Oh! So... Tell me what's going on down there. [ Knocking on door ] Who is it? - Pizza delivery. Maggie Dale, right? Mushroom and pepperoni? [ Chuckling ] I told you, I deliver. - Get in here! - Wow! Maggie, this place is great. - Mmm. - It's just the way I pictured you living. - Well, it's the best home a decorator can buy. I work so much, I barely see what I'm sitting in. - So who picked this out? - Richard. - Pipe. Richard smoked a pipe? - It was his father's. - This wasn't such a great idea, was it? - No, I-- I'm really glad you came by. I am. - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come uninvited. - No! No, it's not you. It's me. - I understand. This is yours and Richard's home. Come on. Let's go out. Come on! - Wait a sec! I need my shoes. - We don't have time! We gotta go now. - That's it! - You know, it's gonna be hard when you leave again. - New York's only an hour away. We'll still see each other. - Mm-hmm. That's what we said last time. - Well, last time, you were supposed to finish graduate school and move to New York! - I know. - You know, you never told me why you didn't. - If I'd come with you back then, you'd have grown sick of me pretty quick. What? You were always meant to be a big star. And I was always gonna be a hard-working newsman. I like what I do, but it's not glamorous. [ Laughing ] - Wait. You think my life is glamorous? My life is so not glamorous! I only... I sew dresses, Harry. - Oh, hardly! - No, it's true! - Maggie, it took me a while to admit it, but we belong to two different worlds. - What about now? - I don't know. - Oh, God! Why didn't I see that? - See what? - The picture! I've only been looking at the people in it, but somebody had to be there taking it! - Yeah, you're right. - Can we go back tonight? - I don't know what I'm looking for here. - Just anything that could belong to whoever took the picture, give us a clue to who it was. Or that can help us with the brunette on the chair. She's still the only one we can't identify! - You are worse than my kids! - What? I'm sorry. I eat when I'm nervous. - OK, look at this. - What are we looking at? - The sweatshirt has the school colours and lettering. - Hey, that's a team sweater! - Can you make it any bigger? - Yeah. OK, W... W... Wil... Wilson! - Lesley Wilson! She was on the cheerleading squad. - "Cousin Laura, Linda." That's what Celia wrote. I bet she couldn't remember Lesley's name! - She was a year or two behind us. - Where is she now? - Don't you remember? She died. Some kind of accident. That weekend, when they were camping. - That's it. That's when it all started. - Where's Susan? She'd know the whole story. - She and Andrew are campaigning in the Northern counties. - Then call her! - I tried earlier. Andrew's office said they were behind schedule, and she'd call later. - She's stopping by your parents' tonight for a fitting. - We don't need to wait for Susan! Let's google Lesley Wilson, see what we find. - Who do you think you are? Oh! [ Screaming ] Help! [ Screaming ] - "Lesley Wilson, 16, was killed in a freak accident "yesterday while on a camping trip with friends. "Apparently, she had gone "for a walk alone in the woods, "and appears to have fallen "from the edge of an unstable cliff." This article is dated July 1991. [ Phone ringing ] - Maggie Dale. - It's Rob West. We need to talk. - Go on. - Not over the phone. Can you meet me at the club tomorrow around 4:00? - I suppose, but is there anything you can tell me now? - Just be careful who you talk to. Your best friends might not be who you think they are. - What are you saying? - I'll see you tomorrow. - That sounded serious. Who was it? - It was Rodney. He's in a fit because some client wants to see me personally about her daughter's coming-out dress. - People still do that? - They do in New York. Look, I gotta go. I told Harry I'd make dinner tonight, so... call you later? - Let me drive you. - No, I'm gonna walk. I need to clear my head. - OK. Bye. [ Brakes squealing ] [ Engine revving ] [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? - Maggie? Hi, it's Susan. I'm sorry I couldn't call you earlier. It's just getting to be a madhouse. - I'm sure it is. - Would you mind if we postponed the fitting until tomorrow morning? - No! No, not at all. - Oh, you're an angel. I'll see you around 9:00. - OK. [ Sighing ] [ Knocking on door ] Who is it? - [Harry]: Who do you think it is? How many people you having over for dinner anyway? - I'm sorry, Harry. I'm just a little jumpy. - You gonna let me in? - Look, can we do dinner another night? I'm exhausted. I have to get on the phone with Rodney and go over a long laundry list of stuff I need to get done. - Yeah, sure. No problem. - OK. - You OK, Mags? - Yeah, I'm just... I'm really beat. - OK. Um, I'll call you tomorrow. Get some rest. [ Car starting ] - That's the most beautiful dress I've ever seen. - What do you expect with an original Maggie Dale? - I'm glad you like it. - I love it! - You look like a movie star. - Now you can get down from your pedestal. - Thank you. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Maggie, did you hear any more about the Lesley Wilson thing? - Actually, I wanted to tell all of you that I've decided to stop playing private eye. It's hard for me to admit it, but you were all right. I've been under a lot of strain since Richard's death, and with all this stuff happening, it's just made it worse. So from now on, I'm gonna stick to what I do best: clothes. - I'm really glad to hear that, Maggie. - And speaking of clothing, I gotta get back to New York to finish some dresses for this weekend's show. - Did I ever tell you you're an angel? - Thank you. - Grab a seat! - What is it we need to talk about that you couldn't tell me on the phone? - Um... That summer that we went camping, uh, in school... there was a... there was a girl. Her name was-- - Lesley Wilson. - Yeah. Lesley. They said that she died in an accident. Well... it wasn't an accident. - Did you do it, Rob? Did you kill her? - You're getting cold. Um... So! How are your friends? - All right, that's ridiculous. I've known those people my whole life. - You really do stick together, don't you? That little clique of yours. None of you have changed. - Is this about Celia? - No! Celia was decent to me, but I saw the way the rest of you toyed with people! - It's not true! - Yeah, it is. I was one of the discards. - All right. Look, I didn't come here to listen to some teenage grudge. Now just tell me, how do you know that Lesley Wilson was killed? - Because I saw it happen. I saw them arguing, and I saw Lesley get pushed. - You saw someone get killed, and you didn't report it? - No one would have believed me then! But now... now, I think it's time for a little retribution. - What are you talking about? - Look. I-- I didn't mean for anybody to get hurt, but I wanted to punish her a bit, you know? I wanted to play with her, the way she played with me! - Oh my God. Who is it, Rob? Who are you blackmailing? - I don't wanna get into any trouble here, so-- - You don't wanna get into any trouble? If it hadn't been for you, the others wouldn't have died. Do you understand me? You're responsible for the deaths of 6 people! You're responsible for the death of my husband! Look. There's only one way to end this. And you will help me. You will cooperate, one way or another. Nadine's 3-piece ensemble begins with a delicious, pure silk camisole over which she wears a soft-stretched lace cardigan trimmed with boa. Nadine's skirt is made of sheer pink cotton with a pleated ruffle effect, perfect for the woman who's looking for a chic, but hip look. [ Applause ] Chanterelle is walking on a cloud, wearing a strapless dress of honeycombed ivory chanton silk with a rose motif. A perfect confection for springtime, guaranteed to accentuate every woman's feminine side. Here we see Caroline dressed in a new version of an old classic: the little black cocktail dress. A strapless top of sexy black silk jersey is worn over a flirty skirt of ruffled silk couture. And finally, a designer normally culminates the show with her best piece. And today, to show us this piece, we have a very special model. The next First Lady of the governor's mansion, and my dear friend... the beautiful Susan Jennings. [ Applause ] Susan is wearing a raspberry chanton silk strapless gown, the front of which displays a bouffant effect, while the back tapers off to a graceful train. - It was you! - What's wrong with Susan? That's... that's Bobby Osbourne! - Please, Maggie. Let me through. - It's over, Susan. - It's not over. It's never over. For years, I thought it was. I thought I could forget about it and move on. - How could you forget about killing someone? - It was an accident! I didn't mean to push her. But we argued. She said I wasn't good enough for Andrew. She was gonna convince his family of that, and you know what he meant to me! It's only when Andrew announced he was going to run for governor that those horrible notes started coming. Someone saw what I did, and they threatened to tell everyone. I had to stop them, don't you see? - So you started killing them one by one? Everyone who was with you that weekend? - I didn't know who saw me. First, I thought it was Nancy. She brought up Lesley's fall, and I saw something in her face that told me. - And Richard? Why Richard? - I ran into him at the tennis matches. He was talking about the old days, and that weekend. I was sure it was him. - I wanna know what you did to him. - It was just a pill. A little pill in his soda, so he'd fall asleep at the wheel. He wouldn't have known it was happening. - And Celia? - She knew. And she was going to tell. But those notes, they just kept coming and coming. But you're my friends. My gang! You've gotta help me. Please, Maggie. - Go away. - There's something I've been meaning to ask you. Any chance of us coming up and spending some time with you over the holidays? - I thought you all had plans! - Plans change. - It's a date. Go! Go get in your cars. Go! [ Sighing ] - I put your luggage in the car already. - That's good. - So you invited the girls to New York, but you never invited me. - Well, not in the last 10 seconds. Oh! What's this? - I got a few days off. - You certainly don't pack light. - They owe me a lot of time. ♪♪ There's no reason ♪ ♪ There's no rhyme ♪ Lost my senses, I've lost my mind ♪ ♪ When a heart has no home ♪ It can't be broken, can't be torn ♪ ♪ And time after time ♪ I can count the goodbyes ♪ Before it's all over ♪ Again ♪ I won't pretend ♪ I won't give in ♪ There's no reason, there's no rhyme ♪ ♪ I've lost my senses I've lost my mind ♪ ♪ There's no need for ever afters ♪ ♪ Happy endings or lullabies ♪ ♪ Oh, lullabies ♪ There's no reason, there's no rhyme ♪ ♪ Oh no, no rhyme ♪ I've lost my senses I've lost my mind ♪♪ Closed captions:Global Vision
