Mr. Simon, I'm not able to believe that you're backing out of this case. I was shocked when they asked me to take over. I always dreamed of ending my career on a high note. But the name… AB' Ram Qureshi has haunted me for seven years… for nothing. Perhaps, you'll do better. I wish you all the best. Any advice… regarding this case? When you're on Qureshi's case, your whole understanding of the world will change. He prepared for the experience. In this age of social media, everyone thinks they are Nero Chakravarthi. While the state is going to dogs, they're busy wasting time clicking selfies. I am here live streaming. Join the live telecast. -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! I was saying… -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! Just like Sati Savitri challenged the Lord of death, Yama for her husband's life, I will too and protect my husband who's in prison. -And that is because… -Chandramati. I am his lawful wife. Lawful wife it seems! I must take a look immediately. The situation is out of control, sir. What do I do? Go about your work. Hey, I hope you've given me Chandramati's right contact number. Oh, God! I hope you've given me Chandramati's right contact number. Why are these stones as small as kidney stones? If you throw them with full force they will work as bullets. These stones have already done damage to four glass window panes. Is it so? Carry on then. Sir, I'm not sure if I'm working for the party or as a part-time broker for the ACP. You have no choice. Once the superior throws an order, forget about brokering. You might as well end up holding lanterns. I'm glad he didn't ask me to go sleep with them. Sir. They think you're a sincere police officer and that is why they're ignoring your calls. I will let them know you're not the kind of an officer they think. Thank you, sir. Hi… Are these idiots just going to spam the live by saying "Hi"? The CM of our state, PKR is dead. At least set social media on fire with "RIP" messages. It would at least look respectable. Who the hell are you? My name is Govardhan. I am an investigative journalist. Is that enough? Life isn't just about switching on the television and anticipating the celebrity who's going to make an appearance. Since the chair of the CM is lying vacant, think about who is going to be the next CM. Why do you care about who the next CM will be? What do you mean by that, you idiot? He will be the one ruling our state as well as making decisions regarding the prices of rice and petrol. Not everyone is as nice as they appear to be. There is a lot of drama that takes place behind it all. Eventually, everyone will show what their true colors are. The strongest contender to be the next CM is Home Minister, Mr. Varma. Today is going to be a black day in the history of the Telugu state. He is the modern-day Chanakya who is capable of manipulating the MLAs and MPs to his end. Mr. Varma is a crocodile who's the most comfortable swimmer in the ocean of politics. Mr. Varma. Yes? Mr. Varma, do you hear these people shouting? People are smashing glass window panes here. Are you happy? I can hear the audio over the phone. But, I'm not able to watch it on TV. Hold on. If they are shouting more than what they are paid to, it must mean that they have a lot of respect for our political party. It's nothing of that sort, brother. The opposition party isn't paying them as much as we are. -Long live PKR! -Long live PKR! -Bangaru Naidu! -Down! Down! -Bangaru Naidu! -Down! Down! -Ram Prasad? -Sir. Our guys are doing a great job at the hospital. Why don't you give their hard work some media coverage? I will take care of it, sir. PKR's sudden death has put the public in great shock. Quite unfortunate. The reason could be the genuine emotional connection that PKR had with the general public. -Suresh and Haritha? -Yes, ma'am. Take care of the media coverage at the funeral hall. -Okay Madam. -Yeah, Ram. I didn't speak to you out there because I knew it would make you uncomfortable. Get back to work. Our channel hasn't been covering the footage of the hospital PKR died in. Look, Ram. If we airtime the pointless fights and struggles taking place at the hospital, there is a chance they might spread across the state and not limit themselves to the hospital. -So, let's just avoid it. -This is not our house Please don't involve yourself in editorial matters. Our channel is being run by the funds given by the ruling party. Given the amount of debt we are in, if not for them, our channel would have long turned to dust. So, stop making plans. The party workers of the Jana Jagruti Party have been expressing their disappointment at the hospital the CM died. The owner of the hospital Mr. Bangaru Naidu is from the opposition party. Therefore the party workers allege that the CM's death was not natural and there could have been a plot… -that's politically motivated. -Yes Naidu. Tell me. What's with your politics regarding a corpse? Why are you making my hospital the scapegoat for your political aspirations? Do you want to take advantage of this sympathy and rule the state forever? Compared to the dirty politics that you indulged in when your father died, our party workers are doing nothing at all. The media is here. Stay in line. Sir, what's your opinion on the untimely death of the Chief Minister? I pray to God that PKR's soul rests in peace. Very soon, the Manasatta Party will hold a mourning meeting for PKR. You're watching the live telecast, right? Yes. I very well know how to turn around the political tides. What about your son-in-law and his contract file worth 100 crore rupees? All I simply asked for was a signature. The CM is no more and yet the work is unfinished. I got the file all ready and stamped, which means that the CM signed it last week. You should have mentioned this before, Mr. Varma. -Thank you. -Yeah. These formalities are not required in a partnership, Naidu. Keep the "Thank you" to yourself. Fold it well and place it in your pocket. Alright. This hospital is the only property that is under my daughter's name, Mr. Varma. Please call off your party workers from protesting. I will get them to burn your effigy and then have them close down the protest. Is that okay? Oh, something's still left? Make it fast. -Down with Bangaru Naidu! -Down with Bangaru Naidu! -Down with Bangaru Naidu! -Down with Bangaru Naidu! -Down with Bangaru Naidu! -Down with Bangaru Naidu! -Down with Bangaru Naidu! -Down with Bangaru Naidu! -Down with Bangaru Naidu! -Down with Bangaru Naidu! Bangaru's reaction will be worth watching at this moment. You wanna see it? Throw some more kerosene on there. Let his effigy burn even brighter. It's spring now. So, make sure it burns hotter than usual. Burn it well, my fellows. Burn it well! -Listen to me, ACP. -Yes, sir. It's time to resort to a baton charge. But make sure we have media coverage that's telecasted over and over again. -Both of them are very important. -Yes, sir. As you say, Mr. Varma. Hey turn on the air conditioner, play a devotional song of Lord Ayappa and let's take a nap. Why would you want to take a nap now, sir? If people are going to be violent in front of us the ideal solution would be to close our eyes. That is what our political elders taught us. You go on. Lord Ayappa, have some mercy on us. You guys carry on. What kind of a party is this? I can't see a single woman protester here. On account of this, these people need to be kicked out of here. -Bangaru Naidu! -Down! Down! Charge! How come you've gotten so devotional? What's this sudden change? If we don't fear God, all of the sins we've committed will get back at us with alarming force. Did it get hit? Maybe we've sinned way too much. Just shut up. Who is capable of being the next Chief minister? The person who has the opportunity and who's also lucky enough… is Jai Dev. He is in charge of the IT wing of the party. The other thing he qualifies for is that he is the husband of the CM's eldest daughter, Satya Priya. He looks so innocent that you would want to get your daughter married to him. But, he is a secret partner in all illegal activities like real estate, fake finance and hawala. Wherever there's corruption taking place he is right beside it. -Long live our political leader PKR! -May he live long! -Long live our political leader PKR! -May he live long! -Long live our political leader PKR! -May he live long! From the political inheritance point of view, the person who's touted to become the next CM is… PKR's eldest daughter, Satya Priya. Sister? She has studied political science. She went through depression in college. Jai Dev was always by her side and she always had his shoulder to cry on Later, he became her husband. But, she never worked for the party nor was she ever seen in public with her father for any political events. Naidu… Mr. PKR was affectionate and treated me like I was one of his own. Don't worry about your father. I'll always be there for you. -That's enough. -Okay. Come on. People are out there waiting to see PKR for the last time. Once you're settled down, I'll ask them to let everyone in. Have you informed the media to not come down here? I did inform them, dear. Sit down. Okay Sir, I just got a call from the PM's office. The PM is on his way. -Greetings. -Greetings. Satya, we got a call from the PM's office saying that the PM is on his way here. Whether it's living or death, one should aspire to do it as PKR did. Great. Varma Uncle. Yes, dear. I don't care about who comes or who doesn't. Just make sure he isn't here. Who do you mean? I will take care of it, dear. MOTHER TERESA ASHRAM This is the last person I'm going to talk about here. For the past six years, his name has gained a lot of popularity in the state. He is the genius who gained a firm hold in the party as well as the adoration among people in a short time. Upon research about him, a lot of evidence was found against him. He was involved in many smuggling deals with Dubai as his headquarters. The most dangerous and mysterious man. Brahma! He is a double-faced man who is in complete contrast to PKR and has gained the public's love and respect over time. Why did PKR have such a man by his side? PKR made him the treasurer There is some sort of a strong relationship between the two of them. Mr. Varma, if you ask me to slit my throat, I would do it, sir. But if you stop Brahma because Satya Priya asked you to, you might have to hang your head in shame and incompetence in front of the public. Hey! Inform her that you won't be able to stop Bramha from coming here. What is it? Sir, the Prime Minister's chopper has just landed. We can use a protocol to stop Brahma from coming here. This seems like a good idea. Go on and deal with this. -Go on, hurry. -You never think… -about getting me promoted… -I will take care of it. but you want all my ideas. These idiots have come here just to look at a corpse. Just go! Idiots! Go! Sir, Brahma's car has entered the approach road. Sorry, sir. The PM's convoy is on the way here. We've been given orders to not allow any vehicles on this route. It's a protocol, right? What do we do, sir? The king that dons the form of the world The one who rules and wears the wheel The beginning that knows no end, The one who judges and punishes The protocol applies only to vehicles. It doesn't apply to my feet. Bloodshed for the sake of peace This is the lesson of war that he talks of Black trade and the underworld is nothing But a mere ring that He wears on his finger Brahma is here! Brahmanna! Brahmanna! Not the one to tolerate the wrongdoing He chases the wrongdoers It doesn't matter where he is He doesn't let anything eclipse the good In one world, the one who knows it all GodFather GodFather What's all this ruckus? Even when the PM is here, we wouldn't have such kind of an uproar. The one who's here is Brahma. Stop those people. Charge! This capable man A warrior who moves forward He fights for the earth In the proportions of Kumbh Mela. A generous man who turns into a saint Even his silence is a burning volcano LONG LIVE RESPECTED PK RAMDAS Satya, we tried our best yet we couldn't stop Brahma. Alright, go ahead. It begins The story of destruction begins The revenge motivated by The intermingling of the politics and evil The one who destroys The political establishment Even weapons of capital punishment Cannot meet out this punishment If it begins, there is no mercy And no direction you can run to Brahma… come here. Come. Your father is here. Come here, my dear. Please call me "Father" once. Father! All the party members think that I'll be the next CM. It's nothing but the blessings of the great, PKR and the adoration of the party workers and leaders. Well, if you could give me some serious thought and consideration as well. I mean if you could just support me with this… I know this isn't the right place to talk about this but… Sir, please tell me who's going to light the sacred funeral pyre. I shall start the ceremony. We are soon approaching the inauspicious time. Why would you ask who's going to light the sacred funeral pyre, priest? Whether it's his son or son-in-law, the only eligible person is Jai. He will be the one lighting the pyre. You go on. No, Mr. Varma. Whether it's son or daughter, It's only Satya She will light the funeral pyre. That's not right, Jai. She is a woman. So what? I will light the funeral pyre. You should be proud that your father is a great leader. But you should never tell anyone that you are the son of that great leader. You must never ask for your rights. Why, Mother? When you were in my womb, God came and asked me. I gave your husband the fate of being the man responsible for so many people. Why did you limit him to yourself? That is why I asked your father to leave us and be with the people. You must think the same as well. PKR who's been the elder of the state so far, will turn into an unforgettable chapter in history tomorrow onward. In front of the tearful eyes of millions of people, PKR's soul has reached the high heavens. Father! Father! PKR's eldest daughter, Satya Priya, lighted her father's funeral pyre with great sadness. Even though the stalwarts of all political parties across the nation have been in attendance for the final journey, people are surprised that Brahma, who's been a constant companion of the late PKR and adored by the party establishment, was not in attendance. I was always a bit concerned as to how I would run the government without the presence of PKR. But with you by my side, I'll manage to rule this state in peace. I am always by your side, Mr. Varma. I had another doubt. -Shall I ask about your friend? -Yes, go ahead. Even though he is wealthy, why is he in such a terrible place? I mean, I don't understand why he stowed himself away in such a secret place. -Good question -Yeah. The only crime that's committed in broad daylight in our nation is "Politics". All the other crimes that are usually committed are better done in secret. And in that case, Abdul is the best person. Half the people that you see here are those who work for him. Within a kilometer, you'll find no one but his men around us. Not just ordinary people… even if the police want to enter here, they will require permission. Jai. I mean, does this meeting really have to take place? Well, now it looks like I am the one who's forcing you to this meeting. I didn't mean it like that, Jai. What I meant to say was-- Listen, Mr. Varma. Our party will come into power tomorrow. There's no doubt. And that's all because of the power and pull that PKR had over the people. And we can ride that wave for a maximum of one year. What about after that? Can you guarantee that our party will come to power after that? You must give me a guarantee. And for that guarantee, we need funds. We get those funds from the person who lives here. An unimaginable amount. Alright, fine. Suppose we don't want the funds he gives. Tomorrow when the opposition party comes to power, we might end up frequenting the courts and jails because of the cases that they might file against us. Do you have that sort of patience? Mr. Varma, you're an elder. If you take a step forward, I will walk with you. If you say no and take a step back, it's fine. Think about it. Mr. Lucas, I'm Mr. Varma. I am quite popular in my state. My popularity can be gauged by the people wishing that -I become the next CM after PKR-- -Mr. Varma. Let me tell him a little about myself, Jai. This isn't Lucas. This is Abdul. He is the one who takes care of all of Lucas's drug business. Like I said before, I have a system in place. and you have the money. We can come together and earn crores. I am okay with the money aspect. But what's the benefit of funding your political party? I will give you my state. You can use the Z category security to smuggle drugs inside. Floka, AH7921, Crystal Meth, Whoonga, Krokodil, you name it. You can choose your favorite drug and sell it however you like. Police, press, judiciary and public… I will make sure no one stands in your way. You are dealing with Lucas, Jai. Think about it once more. I already gave it some thought. Call Lucas. Lucas is already watching us. He is already listening in on this conversation. How much do you want? I need 750 crores every month. And I need six months payment in advance. On one condition. You have to arrange for a drug production plant in your state. Your government closed one of our timber depots in Pamulaparthi village due to deforestation reduction. You must reopen that. We will start our drug production plant there. Yes or no. Yes! Then the deal is okay. Thank you, Jai. Are you happy? I am very happy. Jai… I shouldn't be saying this but… given the network of people you have, PKR hasn't used your resources or talent properly. But I am not like that. You are going to have all the powers in my government. The second position that I have held in the party thus far is now yours. I have already created the list that I am supposed to hand over to the governor. Home and Deputy CM. I've left these blank. You take your pick. Mr. Varma… I heard that you were the one who always kept telling people around that you are going to be the next CM after PKR's death. Well, it was purely out of desire. If you become the CM after PKR's death, what am I supposed to become since I am responsible for PKR's death? Using your authority as a minister, for the past six months you have given government contracts to either absolutely useless people or criminals. Why? Do you think this is a joke? What made you so bold? Since I was the one who gave you these ministerial positions, plucking you out like weeds and throwing you away isn't that difficult for me. Careful. Go! Forgive us, sir. Just leave, sir. Just leave. What's happening in the party, Jai? I will take care of it, father-in-law. I know that you are the face behind their actions. If I ever get to know that either you or those others have committed a mistake again, I will no longer warn you. Do you understand? I get it, father-in-law. But it's you. Those people who went away silently after you reprimanded them… are really dangerous, father-in-law. As soon as I entered the party, they were the ones who showed me the loopholes and the ways I could make money in. I was shocked. They are using our party as a tool to just loot as much as they please of the public funds. What about the party then? That is the reason why I have become their leader. I pilfered the funds as well. And I allowed them to steal money as well. If there is no money, no one is going to remain a member of our party. I have been using those funds to take care of our political party for the past four years. And I've been feeding you with the impression that you are the one taking care of this political party. Father-in-law, you must choose between the party or the people. You can only choose one of the two. If you want both, it's not possible. In the same breath, I ask you to stay alive for a couple more years. Please. Do you mean to say you are going to kill me? To make sure that the party stays afloat… I am ready to kill anyone. You should have told me this when we were on the ground. When you were on the ground, you were building castles in the air. That is why I told you now So that you can understand what the ground reality is. Even Satya believes that I will be the next CM. Will she agree to you being the CM? People will get her to agree. Who? Satya, given the situation our party is in, it would be better for Jai to become the CM. How is it fair to make Jai the CM bypassing the senior leaders within our party? An expert in the Party's affairs is more important than those who have experience. And that's Jai. Madam, I don't think you know about this but the many schemes that PKR unveiled for the public have been the brainchild of your husband, Jai None of these guys are loyal. Disgusting! We are not qualified to talk about loyalty. Well, Jai. How did you manage to get everyone to change their perspective in such a short span? When we turn our desires into others' necessities… we don't have to work that hard. They will work hard for us. Even if they give their all to convince him, getting Satya on board is difficult. She is all for me. I have total faith in her. Satya, it's Mr. Varma who convinced us and ensured that we saw the advantages of your husband becoming the CM. The reason I explained this to you is that you will be safe financially and respected only if you remain my deputy. Excuse me could you please give me some water? Okay, sir. MOTHER TERESA ASHRAM PAMULAPARTHI No matter who decides to become the CM, it all boils down to what Brahma's opinion on the matter is. That's because it's Brahma who helps finance the party with the help of the giant Trust M&M. No one knows what's the relationship between that Trust and Brahma. Why is that man speaking nonsense? He's been talking smack about you as well. He is letting us know his perspective on the political establishment. In civils, you shouldn't only be learning theory. You must observe things such as this and understand the facts and reality. Brother, Narasimhareddy called. Apparently, Jai is pulling no stops in becoming the next CM. It's as we imagined. There was a great king who was ruling over a beautiful kingdom. The king was a good man. During his reign, there was an evil man who entered the kingdom. Satya? Haven't you fallen asleep yet? What are you thinking about? Every time I felt vacuum in my life, you always filled it up and made sure that I had everything I wanted. I am very happy to know that there is someone in our own family… who is capable of carrying on the political legacy bequeathed by my father. Did the ministers drop by? They came in the evening. When they came to me, I said no. And then, they dropped by to meet you. Jai, Everyone says that no one is more deserving than you. Satya, please. Even Mr. Varma called me and said the same thing. What did he say? He said that you are the only person in the party who can give a tough competition to Brahma. Even I agree with them. If you believe in me, I will agree to this. That's 'cause I remember how troubled you were since your childhood with regard to Brahma. Your enemy is my enemy. I will make sure that Brahma doesn't secure an upper hand in our party. It's my promise. Thank you, Jai. Jahnvi asked for a book. Shall I? These days, Jahnvi isn't getting along with me. I am happy that she is at least close to you. It must be one of her mood swings. Next time onward, I am going to make sure that she's close to you as well. -Okay. -Yeah. The princess became a puppet in the hands of that evil man. What do you want? I got something for you. Open it and see. Fresh, Malana cream. I've stopped this habit. Habit? Your lie is just as beautiful as you. Sir, I am David. You introduced me to a girl named Jahnvi, right? She keeps torturing me to send her the stuff right away and that she would pay me later. What do you want me to do? I know you want this. Take it. Jai! Please let me go. Is that a new perfume? -Jai… -Thank me. Thanks. Jai, don't do this. Please. Jai! Let's plan this later. Good night. To save the kingdom from such an evil man, the great king bought home a young boy, raised him and made him his General Was the General able to save the kingdom? Go to sleep, dear. Here's the list of the calls that PKR made to Brahma. Looking at the list, it seems that both of them spoke to each other at least five to six times a day. All these days I felt like PKR was Brahma's strength. But now, it feels like Brahma is actually PKR's strength. Brahma holds a great reputation for being the patron to a lot of people in the Ashram. No one knows where he was for 20 years. Now that he has returned, he's managed to become popular within six years. Idiot! I completely lost my mind the other day when I saw people running behind him. What do you want me to do now? Even if we are okay with Brahma not supporting us, we need to make sure that he isn't an obstacle. That is why it would be better if you call him here and talk to him in person. Invite him. Keep up the good work and study diligently. Would you cut his arm off just because he went against you?! Stop it, guys! Stop fighting! Come, Brahma. Sit down, Brahma. Hey! The furniture is old, and it's termite-ridden. It needs to be replaced with a new one. Everyone says that Jai is the right choice to become the next CM. Is this choice right for yourself or the state? It's nothing like that, Brahma. PKR is now permanently asleep and is God now in the hearts of people. But he has left behind the faithful cadre in a state of disarray. The opposition might take advantage of this power vacuum by inciting caste violence and regional divisions. To withstand such huge challenges and win the next election… the funds that our party has is not enough. We have M&M funds, don't we? They are not enough. Peanuts… are food for poverty! Not for a political party. What Jai means to say is, to push our party to success or even spend money for the next elections, we don't have enough funds. Fortune favored us with Jai using his relationships and influence to make a deal with the company to help us fund the elections. Since you are the treasurer of the party, we thought it wise to inform you-- Whose company is that? It is a pharmaceutical company. They have a strong base. Where is that strong base located? Goa, Mumbai, Lakshwadeep… Goa? Mumbai? Lakshwadeep? Pharmaceuticals? Do you mean drugs? By pharmaceuticals I mean medicines. Those legal kinds of drugs. No. Narcotics. Just a minute, Jai. Let me deal-- Why should I be scared of anyone, Mr. Varma? Yes. They are drugs. So what? Narcotics is a dirty business. Are you really qualified to say that, Brahma? Do you think I don't know what you've done to grow big in places like Dubai? It would be better if you don't oppose me or my decisions. That's 'cause there is no more PKR to save you. Who's there to save you? Little kid! Brahma, let's talk this through. Tell us what you want. Tell me what you want. Home, revenue, finance. Tell me what is it that you want. I don't want a position of power. I want order. I know what kind of games everyone is playing here and what everyone is up to. Yes. It's a game. Here I am the King. Brahma is the one who creates the King and even the Kingmaker. This Brahma, here. Remember that. As long as I am alive, I will make sure that nothing goes wrong in this party. I will make sure that this seat isn't termite infested. Oh my goodness! He is literally breathing fire! I regret asking him to come to this meeting. No, Mr. Varma. If this meeting had not taken place, I would never have known Brahma's power. Do one thing. Speak to all our MLAs. Figure out how much each of them needs. Let's throw money their way. I will take care of it. Tell me, Abdul. The drug manufacturing equipment is all ready. If you get the government-sealed factory reopened, I will send the equipment there. Be careful it's a sensitive topic. Just send it. I'll take care of it. How is it going? Tomorrow, we are going to meet the Governor with 140 MLAs. Soon you will see me as a CM. That is good, Mr. CM. Bheemavaram MLA, Mr. Raju. Greetings, sir. -Sir. -Mr. Narasimha Reddy. He is a very important person in our party. I know him. Greetings, sir. Greetings, sir. Gold Seshadri! Vizag MLA. Show us your rings. Brother is busy inside. Tell me, what's the issue? The meeting here has started. What is Brahma's plan? I will inform him. Greetings. Renuka says that apart from putting the chain on his neck, you must also name him. Yes, brother. You used to think that you had no one. But, the truth that turned that thought into a lie is your son. I am naming him Satya. Satya! The letter in your hands states that you agree to Jaidev becoming the CM. As soon as you sign that paper, the rest of the amount that is owed to you will be deposited into your accounts. The news is that all the MLAs are ready to sign over their support to Jaidev. They could be taking an appointment from the governor either today or tomorrow. They started their dirty politics. We must go there and do something or the other, brother. You've already ticked the place where we need to sign. This is a big deal for all 140 of us. Just 139. What do you mean by 139? Isn't it 140? MOTHER TERESA CHARITABLE TRUST Tell me, brother. What do you want us to do? I will take care of it. You stay here, Koti. In this herd of sheep, there is a dog that's worn a sheep's clothing and infiltrated this herd. That dog is loyal to Brahma and is backstabbing us. If we kill that one dog, we would be left with 139 MLAs, isn't that so? Narasimha Reddy. In the middle of last night, I thought I heard a loud engine sound. I came out of my hut to see who it was. There were about 20 of them. They were in jeeps and lorries, and they brought a lot of machinery along with them. There were a lot of guns as well. They were speaking in Hindi. I inquired as to who was at the check post and found out that it was Mr. Varma. When everyone is on one side, what is it that you seek to achieve by standing in favor of Brahma? If you die, at the most, there might be a by-election. You carry everything that goes on here to your owner, don't you? Call him one last time. Call him. Tell me, Reddy. Brahmanna… I got caught. All of you get caught as well. I am a supporter of Brahma. Me too! Not just me. If all the 40 faithful dogs here bark at the same time, no matter what you do, you can never become the CM. Didn't you take money from us and agreed to sign the letter? What's all this nonsense now? Sir… Mr. Brahma asked us to agree and we agreed. Now, he's asked us to get up and leave. So, now we are leaving. Let's go Hey! Brahma is here. Leave everything here and go! This factory has been sealed off by the government. You cannot be here. Who the hell are you? Didn't he already tell you? Come on, get lost! Have you lost your mind? Hey! I will drill a hole in your head and there will be no trace of you left. Brahma… Brahma… Brahma! You keep saying his name but why won't you tell me what happened out there? He isn't the same Brahma that we've seen all these years, sir. He is the dancing Lord Shiva, the eternal destroyer in rage. A great man with The strength of an elephant That makes his enemies tremble with fear The strong man Who smashes shoulders is here The divine elephant that trumpets And displays its strength When it spins its trunk like a wheel Everything in its way is smashed The divine elephant that trumpets And displays its strength When it jumps and steps on The jackals rivulets of blood will flow When he hits you on your chest The bodies turn into mush When he beats up the ribs They lose their minds The man who chases The assailants and thrashes them He is like a sharp sickle With piercing looks He is the brother of the forest goddess When you cross his way, you are finished When he tucks his sarong and comes forward He becomes the axe on The teak wood chopping block When he twirls his mustache He becomes the saw that cuts wood Even if the muscular man oppose him He is going to hit him so hard that He begins to remember his father If anyone obstructs his path he Is going to stamp on him violently and go A great man with The strength of an elephant That makes his enemies tremble with fear The strong man who Smashes shoulders is here He killed them. He didn't spare even a single thought. Did he kill all of them or only a few? For some people, this is like the vermilion dot. Everywhere they turn they see red, sir. Brahma didn't even give us time to count. He did give a pause, Mr. Varma. Send ACP immediately to that place. Even if we find a hair… we can cover the entire mountain with it. Tell me, Sudhakar. Okay. Sir, Sudhakar just gave me a report. Even after they searched within the two kilometer radius, they couldn't find a single thing, sir. At least bullet casings, weapons, anything at all? We used the metal detector and checked the place out, sir. Absolutely nothing, sir. I think we have been misguided, sir. Yes, Indrajeet. What happened? How long are you going to take? Tell me, what's the news out there? Whoever gave you that good news could either be a mentally retarded person or Brahma's magician. This looks like a playground that's been thoroughly cleaned up after a match. What are you saying? -Do you mean to say there are no corpses? -No. If we dig this place out, we might end up finding our forefathers. But there are no bodies that you reported. The seal is just as it had always been. Thank goodness the media isn't around. If not, we would have ended up as fools. If you plan something for Brahma, use your eyes instead of ears for planning. Enough with the searching. Let's go. I didn't want Narcotics to enter our state. But he dared establish a manufacturing plant for the very same drugs. Tell us what to do, brother. Arrange for the party working committee meeting. Tell everyone that I will become the president and take charge of the party's activities. We've been waiting to hear this for so long. I am going to inform all our supporters. Satya, I told you I need some space. Jai, open the door. Three hours, Jai. You've been sitting alone and drinking. Why are you so disturbed? Because I don't want you to get disturbed. What are you talking about? That Brahma is trying to snatch our 100 MLAs by organizing a party meeting and becoming the party's president. Satya, as long as your father was alive, Brahma remained calm. But now that your father is no more, he is showing the world his true colors. Brahma acted calm and innocent in front of your father and now he is using all sorts of illegal ways to prove that he is the political heir. Satya, I am asking for only one thing. I need your permission to lose. Because if we try hard to win, the party is going to split into two. As long as I am alive, I will never let that happen. At the most, what can happen? Brahma will become the president of the JJ party established by PKR. Mom, Dad is here If you bring him inside, I am as good as dead. Why would you bring someone who's born to some whore here? There's an orphanage that's built for this very purpose. Why couldn't he be put in that orphanage? Sowjanya, when all of us are here why would he be an orphan? Satya and Brahma are equal in my eyes. Is that so? Yes, now you claim that both of them are equal. In the future, you are going to say that this boy is more important to you than my daughter. Listen, as long as I am alive, I will make sure that my daughter doesn't face such a situation. Why couldn't you have died along with your mother? Sowjanya! Did you see that Satya? Your father hit me because of this boy here. We are not a priority for your father. This boy is more important than us. He is more important. You! Sowjanya? Sowjanya? Mom! Mom! What has happened?! Sir, the baby is safe but sorry to say… Mother? Mother? Mother, get up. Satya, open the door! He killed my mother. There's no way he is staying with us. Please listen to me, dear. He is your elder brother. -I don't have an elder brother. -Please listen to me, dear. Father, you might think that mother is no more. My mother is with us. And that is the reason why everything in this house must obey her wishes. Mother said that he is no more welcome in this house. He should not be in this house! JANA JAGRUTI PARTY Smt. Satya Jaidev, the daughter of our leader, PKR. She has come here to talk about an important issue. Satya. Greetings to everyone. I will come straight to the point. After my father's death, a few people here want to get their hands on the party. That is the reason why I would like to propose that the person who's worked hard and given a lot for the party, my husband and the son-in-law of PKR, Jaidev as President of the Party -I-- -Madam, this is the party working committee meeting Only those who are members of the committee are allowed to speak. Hello Naidu I meant Reddy What is it that you're saying? You are saying that PKR's daughter has no right to speak here. As the daughter of PKR, she has a lot of respect in the party. But she shouldn't interfere in the internal matters of the party. Who the hell are you to say that? Why are you running your mouth? Are you so bold thinking that Brahma wouldn't be here? Why do you keep saying that Brahma will be coming here? No matter who it is, they are always second to PKR's daughter Satya. Yes! Always second to Satya madam. Keep quiet! Stop it! -Who the hell are you to say no? -Yes? Who the hell are you? Stop it! You stop it! Sit down everyone If there is any action or decision to be taken, Brahma needs to be here. Wait until then I came here to speak to you. I will tell you what needs to be said. I have no reason to wait for someone else. You must wait. There he comes, the brilliant sun Around which our world revolves Here he comes, there he is The one who inspires fear and awe Here he comes, there he is The strongest one of his times Who faces many obstacles Here he comes, there he is The one who protects the world He never let's go Brahmanna, if you become the party president, the party is going to be split into two. That's just a rumor. I am not going to be the president. Satya Priya is going to be the president. There he comes The steady one who brings goodness There he comes, the one with A mind of a genius and capabilities To make a decision here, one needs to have authority. If you want power, you should be eligible to hold it. It doesn't hold any value for undeserved sayings. How can we say all this to a woman in front of all the people there, Brahmanna? Satya hates you. If you do this, won't the hatred towards you intensify, Brahma? Let it intensify. I will turn that hatred into my weapon and bring Satya to light. Being an heir doesn't mean inheriting the position. It means responsibility. Only when the raw gold burns in a fire it becomes an ornament. Only after the caterpillar is insulted by people around it, it will be able to turn into a butterfly and fly. There's no way around it. Tomorrow, this will be the acid test for Satya. Satya is PKR's daughter. The respect that this fact commands is enough for her. Being a PKR's daughter is a matter of pride for her family, not for us. If she really likes you all that much, ask her to give you as many privileges as she can afford. Don't make us suffer her just because you think she deserves respect. Some of you are questioning my authority of being here and speaking to you all. I am telling them this. This isn't an excuse. This is my answer. My father is PKR. He spent all his life establishing this party, walking with you all and helping the people. You are all fine. But do you know what I've lost? I lost my childhood. My beautiful childhood. This is the pain of years of waiting for my father to come home while having a just born on my lap when I was just seven years old. Isn't that my right? Our party, our people. When my father was narrating the Bhagawat Gita of the voiceless masses, I was the one who wrote every letter of it. If every thought in the manifesto was born out of his boiling blood, I am his blood too. Isn't that my right? I might not have directly involved myself in the party affairs. But the party has always been there inside of me since my childhood You are all my family. This is my home. Why would I need the right to talk to my family? Tell me Madam… we do not obstruct your rights. Other than the mere qualification of being your husband, tell me one thing that qualifies him to be the president of such a huge party as ours. Alright. It looks like everything here is unfolding according to a plan. And I can understand that. It's the plot to make sure that PKR's family stays away from the party. If you all think that I am ineligible to become the president of the party, Satya, who is the PKR's heir certainly has that right. Jai. I know what I'm doing Satya. I propose Satya as the New President of the Jana Jagruti Party. If there is anyone who dares to stop this or even opposes this… they are most welcome to. I congratulate Ms. Satya Priya on becoming the new president of the Jana Jagruti Party. Congratulations and all the very best. There he comes, the brilliant sun Around which our world revolves Here he comes, there he is The one who inspires fear and awe Here he comes, there he is I am confident that she will emerge successful from this test. The reason is that she is PKR's blood. -May the leadership of Satya Priya -Continue to live long! -May the leadership of Satya Priya -Continue to live long! -May the leadership of Satya Priya -Continue to live long! -May the leadership of Satya Priya -Continue to live long! You did extremely well by bringing Satya to the meeting. Your plan worked out so flawlessly that even Brahma couldn't say anything anymore. If you bring those 40 MLAs to our side, I will pray to you as my God for the rest of my life Please wait and watch, Mr. Varma. You will see the actual event tomorrow. You said that you have to leave. Where will you go, dear? Brother, the help that you have given me thus far is quite a lot. I cannot depend on you any longer. I shall leave. Listen… This Ashram was built to give shelter to orphans like us. We've all gathered here because we are unable to bear the outside world, isn't it so? And now you say that you want to go back out there. How will you survive out there? I have decided to leave. Please don't stop me anymore, brother. Alright, it's your wish. Please keep this. Don't say no. Take it. Be careful. Drop her where she wants to go. Alright, sir. Listen, dear. If you get in trouble, remember you have a home and a brother who takes care of you. Don't forget that. No matter what you say… it's wrong to deceive such a good man. This is not deception. I desire to stay together with you. What are these unnecessary transactions on the credit card for the last month? Why did you need that money so badly? Sister, please. Give me a break. I already have a bad headache. Satya… you guys are at it again? I kept saying no but you gave her a credit card. Last month, she withdrew three and a half lakh rupees. When I asked her the reason, she doesn't say anything at all. -If I hit her once-- -Satya, stop. Janhvi isn't a kid. You know that. I am not the one treating her like a kid. You are the one who's doing that and indulging her every wish. I know. Go and watch NNTV news. -What? -There's something important. And you would feel better. Don't support her, Jai. Looking at her, I feel like something is wrong. You go. I'll handle her. Go. Are you using local drugs? If you want drugs ask me You are quite tempting. But there is something more important that I need to take care of outside. Say no to local drugs. Tell me, Ms. Renuka. Why did you decide to speak to NNTV channel instead of talking to the police… about the atrocities committed upon you? I was scared. I was scared that he would use his power and influence to hurt me and my child. I was scared. Don't be scared. Until justice is served, our NNTV channel with fight alongside you. Tell me. I lied and told everyone that someone cheated on me and ran away. But… this child was born to me from Brahma. You called him your brother and lied. May someone take you away and finish you. May someone slice you! Is this your plan or Jaidev's plan? I want TRPs and they want political profit. So, how does it matter whose plan it is? He would ask me to call him his brother in front of everyone. I went through hell in that Ashram. Not just me… he used the Ashram as an excuse and is indulging in many horrible acts. A lot of people there are going through hell. Please provide protection for my child and me. Please help me. This is the injustice meted out to Renuka. Listening to the unspeakable acts of crime that men who are portrayed as leaders of the society commit, makes one wonder about the direction this society is moving towards. NNTV will not stop fighting until people such as him are brought to justice. Don't leave this issue Don't forget, the Mana Satta Party is here to fight for all women who have experienced injustice and crime. -Justice should be done to Renuka! -Justice should be done to Renuka! -Justice should be done to Renuka! -Justice should be done to Renuka! -Brahma! -Down! Down! -Brahma should be punished! -Brahma should be punished! It's turned out into an even bigger sensation than I thought it would be. But I am a little scared as to how Brahma would react, sir. From now on wards, instead of thinking about it in professional terms, think about it in political terms. Then, not just Brahma… even those who are behind him will have to take a step down. -Brahma! -Down! Down! -Brahma! -Down! Down! -Brahma! -Down! Down! -Brahma! -Down! Down! -Brahma! -Down! Down! -Brahma! -Down! Down! -Brahma! -Down! Down! -Brahma! -Down! Down! -Brahma! -Down! Down! -Brahma! -Down! Down! This is Brahma's arrest warrant, madam. But he is an important leader in your party. Only if you cooperate with us as the party president, we will be able to execute this order smoothly. If there is evidence of the crime, our party will not support Brahma. What's this injustice, Brahma? Do they need to let go of all ethics and moral conduct just for the sake of power? Brahma? Brahma? I heard that the police would come and take you into custody. What horrible fate is this? Such a horrible fate! Grandma, please don't be anxious. Just take care of the children and the ashram. I'll go there and be right back. Hello? Sir, this isn't some sort of a guest house where you can come and go as you please. It's prison. Get up. I said that I would come, didn't I? Is this really necessary? What? Yes, sir. It is. According to IPC 376. POCSO Act, sections four and five. This is protocol, sir. It's law. Let's go. Brahma! -Please don't go, Brahma. -Keerti. -Brahma, don't go. -Dear, I am not going anywhere. -Brahma, please don't go. -I will be back soon. Uncle, please. Please, let Brahma go. -Please, Uncle. -Calm down, dear. Move aside. -Please don't take Brahma away, uncle. -You go inside. -Please don't take Brahma away. -Hey! Brahma! Are you being bold because this place is yours? GodFather! GodFather! I am bold because of my heart. Drag him away! -Brahma must be hanged! -Brahma must be hanged! -Brahma must be hanged! -Brahma must be hanged! -Brahma must be hanged! -Brahma must be hanged! -Brahma must be hanged! -Brahma must be hanged! -Brahma must be hanged! -Brahma must be hanged! -Brahma must be hanged! -Brahma must be hanged! -Brahma must be hanged! -Brahma must be hanged! He is both the cause and the effect He has the ability To stop the force of a river The masses follow him The adventures of politics Are not new to him Sir, it's that cell. -Open. -Okay, sir. Brahma! When you hit the road, there's a convoy in front of you and at the back as well. When you step out in public, people sing your praises and laud you! They shout, scream and chant for you. Where's all that now? My Experiments with Truth. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Do one thing. Use this as an experience and write a book. The name of that book could be… "My results with the Truth". By Brahma. So, when people read it, they will understand that those who fight for the public will never have anything remaining for themselves. It will become a best seller. Show me some emotion, Brahma. Be it anger or fear. The success that my enemy doesn't acknowledge is more insulting than defeat. Just getting you to sit here means that I've already won half the war, Brahma. The very people that worshiped you are dousing your cut-outs in petrol and burning them. I pity you. Alright. Since you are quite popular, let's come to a gentleman's agreement. Counsel and send the 40 MLAs that are with you, to my side. Don't stuff their heads with nonsense about public, public service, ideals, ethics and confuse them. And you try not to be confused as well. As soon as I take the oath of being the CM with the public's support, I will bring you out with great fanfare. Deal? I thought having prison food must have brought you back to reality. But I was wrong! Now I'm telling you this. I know how to earn those 40 MLAs that are on your side. You stay right here, go through those books in the library just like a spider and spend the rest of your life in here. In a few days, I will become the next CM. I will rule this state with an iron fist. You just watch me. Open the door. Open the door. GodFather! GodFather! GodFather! Hello? There's a call for you, sir. Hey, Mr. Masoom. Greetings to you. Greetings to you too, sir. I am eager to know who would dare to put you behind bars except for yourself. It looks like there's been a well-designed plan laid out. Don't you forget this younger brother of yours. I could come right now if you want me to. That's not necessary. Let's wait for the right time. Wait for my command. Of course. Take care. Take care of yourself. The time that the governor has given us for the formation of government is almost over. But even now, we aren't ready. The reason for that is you. You need to understand this fact and change your opinion. Brahma knows what's good for the party. We will not do anything that goes against his word. You mean to say that you are okay with the opposition grabbing the power? -Is that what you're saying? -If that's the decision that's taken, we will support it. Do you even know what you are talking about? Your leader is in jail now. And because of that, he isn't in the party either. Brahma is still in the party, Satya. He has the support of 40 MLAs, four ministers and lakh of party workers. Through their support, he is with us. I am requesting you. This is the party established by the great leader PKR. Please don't divide it. Please tell me what you don't like about me. I will change it. There's no need to change it. You just need to answer my question. Brahma who was beside PKR all this while, is no longer supporting you. Because I am by Jai's side Listen. I am much more stubborn than my father. Your leader knows this fact very well. I know very well how to save the party and make Jai the CM. You guys decide if you want to stay in the ministry or not. I am done, Jai. It's over with them. Satya? Jai, did you see how bravely they spoke despite Brahma being in jail? He's alive, isn't he? He shouldn't be. You thought about it long and hard before you came inside, did you not? A lot of people are lying in wait to kill you. We got the opportunity. If only an opportunity is needed to kill me, a lot of people had such an opportunity and lost it as well. But Brahma remains standing. This time around, that won't be happening. If we kill just you, the 15 of us here are set for life. Single payment. Do you think we will let go of such an opportunity? You told me how much my life's worth. Why will I let such an opportunity go? Well, shall we begin the game? Sir… a fight broke in the carpentry section, sir. -Brahma is… -Do this. Lock the shutter from outside and call for an ambulance. Sir. Please let us go, Brother. Go! Go and tell who sent you. I might be away from politics but politics is not away from me. When the baby is crying his lungs out, instead of pacifying him, why are you sitting and staring? It's my punishment. It's the punishment for my sin. What the hell are you talking about? He named the child "Satya". Ever since I lied, he hasn't even been drinking my milk. What can be a bigger punishment than this for a mother? If you cannot breastfeed him, feed him formula. Even though I am telling you my pain, why can't you understand? I cannot live a life of lie. I will not find peace until I tell the truth to the people on the TV channel. Will you take me or not? Tell me Koti Brother Jai, remember Renuka? The girl from the Ashram? She keeps saying that she betrayed Brahma and wants to confess the truth. She is a nuisance. If you send me the passport and the amount, I will send her out of the country. Forget about sending her to another country. Send her to another world. -Brother, please… -Koti! I am already occupied with a lot of stressful things. Don't irritate me. Kill both of them. I won't let it come that far, brother. If it does, I will take care of it. Why direct the anger you feel for Brahma towards that poor fellow? You saw how good I am with politics. Why don't you check out my politricks? Why don't you put a little sugar in this? There's already some sugar, sir. -Where is it? -In your body. Naidu? The entire city needs treatment from your corporate hospital while you get natural treatments done in a place that's far away from the city. Is this fair? You came so far to meet me. But I cannot do the favor that you ask of me. -But-- -Do you know how long I've been waiting for this opportune moment? Varma, the day that PKR died, I dreamt about him. He said, "Naidu, you are the next CM”. And things are unfolding exactly the way he predicted. Look at the situation. Brahma is in jail and Jai is tensed. And you come begging for help. Do you think I'll keep quiet? You must be thinking that if Jai loses, our party, JJP, would lose all its goodwill and you will gain advantage in the political environment. But that is when Brahma would enter the picture. Brahma is no ordinary man, Naidu. If Jai is the head of JJP, it would be easier for us to take the reigns of the party into our hands at any time. But if Brahma gets hold of the reins… Remember you talked about your dream earlier that said… "Naidu, you are the next CM". You might not have the time or the peace of mind to fall asleep and dream up such sweet scenarios. What do you want me to do? I will make sure that the image of the opposition isn't tarnished. Send 27 MLAs who are in your alliance with me. Tell me how much money do you need. I will arrange it for you. To make sure that the 100 MLAs on our side do not slip… and ensure that 27 MLAs join our side, we need a lot of money. Even if one MLA is reduced out of 127 MLAs, we will not be able to form the government Tell me, Jai. We need to chain a few dogs in the opposition to our party. Once that's done, we are through. Everything is in your hands. Lucas is already angry about the Timber factory not being unsealed. Abdul, the man who opposed us last time is currently in jail. No one will oppose us or stop us. Alright. I already told you that you can sell drugs in the state after I become the CM. You need not wait. You can send drugs along with money and start business immediately. Okay, Jai. I will speak to Lucas and get him to agree for you. Alright. Yes, Masoom. The job is done. Thank you. What? They blasted the container? Who did that? How? What are you saying, Jai? If we don't give the opposition the money at the appointed time, we will not get our hands on those MLAs support. Blasted! I've been requesting the governor for some more time and have postponed the meeting with him twice. If this is the way you are going to handle things, it would be difficult for you to become the CM, Jai. Shut up! Instead of thinking about who's behind ensuring that my money doesn't reach me… I will become the CM. Alright. Why are you tensed? Just let it go. Mistakes are being committed, Brahma. No matter what you did, the party that's supposed to come to your aid has betrayed you. How horrid. Jai is the one who's responsible for all the things that are taking place. I joined hands with him because I wanted to take the party forward and fill the vacuum left by our leader PKR. I am feeling guilty and was wondering how to ask for your forgiveness. And here I get to know that he sent men to kill you. Disgusting! How much more can he fall off the wagon?! I made a mistake, Brahma. You must forgive me. Please, don't say no. Did you come here only for the sake of seeking my forgiveness? Coming to the point, there are only two ways in which our party can survive. Either you should become the CM or make sure that I become the CM. Did you come to speak about this? No, Brahma. Now if I become the CM, everyone would consider me a puppet and you, the puppet master Why would I need such sort of reputation? Even if you don't need the position, that position needs you. You are going to be the judge, the jury and all in between. I came here to tell you that. Did you come here only for that? I… Alright, Brahma. I agree. I did everything and came here for my selfish motives. I came here driven by selfish reasons. Being with PKR, we are used to winning. Being in a position of power has become an obsession of mine. What's wrong with that? They say that the fish in the lake eat the algae to feed themselves. What could be bad about that? They are getting rid of all the algae. Think of me as that fish. It could lead to the clean-up of our Jana Jagruti Party. Brahma, when I look at your eyes, I am unable to stop myself from spilling the truth. Just say yes. I will tell you the way to manipulate 100 MLAs of our party. You just need to say yes. A yes. Yes! I just need that yes. You kept nagging me about why I came here and made me regret being born on this earth. I will take care of the rest. Not just words. I will prove it with my actions. Don't cry, dear. Who are you? Is Koti here? Who is it? Why did you come here? Didn't I tell you that I will come to you? They asked me to settle the issue. Who is he, dear? I will tell you. First, go and get some coffee. What about the passports and the tickets? They are here. They asked me to get rid of both of you. What the hell are you saying? Renuka will not go against my word. There's no need for this. Put it back inside. If she sees it, it's going to lead to a problem. It's an infant. Just like this, I am a weapon. I will do what I am asked to do. Don't stop me. This is my son. If that's the case, tell this to those who should hear this. They will decide. Brother, it's Koti. Brother Jai, Renuka isn't some orphan in the Ashram. She is my wife. He is my son. I thought that I could do anything for money. But I got to know that I have my limits because of my kid. Please let them go, brother. They will go far and away and live their lives. If it pleases you, do what you want with me. I am sparing you because you laid down your life in exchange for that infant's life. Brahma… please forgive me. I am not such a great man to forgive you and neither am I God to bear with all sorts of nonsense. I am just an ordinary man who cannot tolerate any wrongdoing. Don't give your child the fate of living as someone without a father, despite having one. At least from now on wards, make sure you take good care of your infant and your wife. If not, you are going to lose your life. If people like you who work for Jai are driven by money, Think about the people who work for Brahma just because they simply respect and worship him. Here are your passports and tickets. Sir. Greetings. Everywhere I go, I am flooded with conversations about you. Given that you are capable of calling a civilian inside the prison just to chat with him, I can understand how powerful you are. Sit down, please. How are you? As long as I didn't come to your attention, I was fine. I don't know how I would be from now on. The thing that I like about you is this arrogance. Sir, I think what I have is courage. If you call it arrogance, I can't do anything about it. Please tell me why you called me. This is the list of leaders from our party who have been committing illegal acts. I have complete knowledge about these people. But I don't have proof. If it's about you, I have a huge record of proofs filed under your name. Do you want me to give it to you? Thank you. We will talk about this later on. But first, I would like you to use your investigative journalism and give me all the evidence regarding their corrupt activities. Sir, I know what you would do with all that information. You would blackmail all of them and become the CM. I got to know that Home Minister Varma came and visited you yesterday. Why do you want to play with my life, sir? Govardhan! Sit down! Look, my friend. Don't judge a book by its cover. The only thing you know about me is my binding. I know what's on the binding and what's inside the book as well. You have a political mask on and all that you do is criminal activities. I won't tell you that I am a good guy. But I can truthfully tell you that I am not a bad guy. You have no right to counsel me about the truth. What have you done with your honesty? This isn't something that disappears overnight. This is society. If I have as much free time as you do, even I would come up with some catchy sayings as you did. I will risk my life for the sake of the truth that I believe in. I will go to any extent and fight for it. You can go to any extent? Absolutely. Can you reach the level of the CM PKR? Can you go to the heights of fighting honestly like him? Master? Father? Did he really call for me? The CM was the one who remembered your birthday and asked me to bring you along, Brahma. All of your contracts are illegal. If I permit them, in the future, people might have to buy drinking water and the very air that they breathe with money. Basic needs of the people such as education, medicine, amenity… if things like this that are in the purview of the government get into the hands of the private sector, what's the point of having a government? What would the government end up doing? You should have said all this when you came to us to ask for party funds. We made you a CM with our money so that you would be useful to us. It's not for you to reject the projects that we brought to you. If you really want to perform such acts of service, go and establish some charity or trust. Just because we asked you to sign a few contracts, you spout some morals. Please listen to me once. We don't have much time to spare to get into a discussion about this with you. If you don't sign the contracts and license files by tomorrow you will no longer remain in that CM position. -Careful! -Let's go. Please try to understand what I'm saying. Please. That day it wasn't the tear of the CM that hit the ground. It was the golden future of crores of people. He dreamt of giving this state a great rule. Do you know the cost of that? It's the life that you are pointing fingers at. To do anything good, one needs authority. And if one needs authority, one needs money. To make sure that the dreams that PKR dreamt of, be turned into reality, I went into darkness. Whatever it may be, you turned into a criminal as well. Brother, if you want to fight darkness, you should go into darkness, my brother. Can't you fight without stepping into darkness? No, we cannot. Here, the value of a strong man's lie is greater than the truth of the weaker man. That is why truth always loses the battle. Satyameva Jaite. -I believe that, sir. -Siblings of moles and mountains That is the reason why I asked you to come. Relatives of the gunpowder We are spark personified -The feet which stepped on land mines -Thank you. We are a walking melancholy Buried inside your heart We are those stains of blood that get Overshadowed by the greenery of nature NN TV TELUGU Alright, listen up everybody. For some sensitive reasons, all your phones will be collected now. -Security? -Okay, madam. Fight! Keep fighting! The heat of the fight is being helpless March on, soldier! March on There is no stepping back from here on! Hanumanth, take this as breaking news. Haritha, get ready. -Let's go LIVE. -Okay, ma'am. Three… two… one! Greetings. Let's watch the big breaking news on NNTV, the channel that walks with the truth. Renuka who has made allegations of atrocities on the JJ Party treasurer, Brahma,… is now with us in our studio. Let's find out the reason in her own words. Renuka, tell me. Renuka said that Brahma is the father of this infant here. All that is a lie. I am the father of this infant here. Renuka is my wife. I was the one who got greedy for money and made her tell this lie. March ahead, soldier! March ahead! -You've been changing your narrative. -Shekar! -Where is my wife? -She stepped outside, sir. No. I am saying this because Brahma has my back. Fight! Keep fighting The heat of the fight is being helpless March on, soldier! March on! There is no stepping back here on Listen, Renuka. You were bold enough to make such accusations on that day. Why is it that you are so quiet today? The only thing I have to say is that… Brahma is living out the prison sentence for the wrong I committed. He is the God who helped me get back on my feet in life. Our Brahmaanna. Please release him from prison. This ambition took birth along with me And will still spread its light Even after my death What the hell is happening here? How dare you do this on my channel without my permission? Today's dying star will someday turn into A light bringer for thousands of eyes March ahead, soldier! March ahead Earlier, you said that you lied for money. Who is the person who gave you the money to tell such a lie? All this has been plotted… March ahead, soldier! March ahead to ruin the good reputation that Brahamanna holds. Keep the close shot. The person behind this is… -Hey, Ram! Don't! -Not a word. Out of this place! And all of you, out! Janhvi lost consciousness and was found on the ground in the college bathroom, madam. The housekeeping lady saw her and immediately called me. This hospital is the best for high-profile cases, madam. Heavy doses of drug usage, madam. If she is unconscious in the very first session, that means this didn't happen in the college for sure. She must have consumed drugs at home. The drug that Janhvi took local, ma'am. It's like LSD. It's called Malana Cream. It's quite common in the corporate sector. She is in that room, ma'am. She has regained consciousness. We are continuing with the IV fluids, ma'am. She might have to stay a couple of days in the hospital. I need to speak to her in private. Hello? I need all the medical reports of Janhvi. They are just normal tests-- If that's the case, we might need to file a case and take action against the hospital and the college for hiding a narcotics case. What do you say? Drugs? Where did you get the drugs? Our family, the reputation that our father holds in the state… did you not remember any of that? Jai and I have been giving you everything that you asked for. How did you get this dirty habit? Tell me. Even if I tell you, you wouldn't believe me. First, tell me. Jai. Sister, it's your husband Jai. Not just now. He's been giving them to me for a long time. Go and ask him. Janhvi! Are you going to lie to escape the consequences of your wrongdoing? You are not worthy of even uttering his name. You are the one who brought home an unworthy man! Do you know what goes on in that house and what I go through in there? Even if you don't believe me, that's fine. Please don't trust him. Your Jai… He mixed drugs in my food without my knowledge and gave them to me, sister. He got me addicted to drugs and now he tortures me into becoming his sex slave. But, Jai has always treated you like his own kid. He's never thought of me as a kid! He is a pervert. I swear on our father. If not you who else is going to believe me? I feel like I am in hell, sister. Please save me out of this. Satya? I heard that Janhvi is in the hospital. How is she? I already knew that Janhvi was addicted to drugs. I knew it would upset you, so I chose not telling you. I tried my best to get her to quit. But it got out of hand. Dirty drugs. Who could have gotten her addicted? Why did you do this to my sister? You got a kid addicted to drugs just so you could use her? You don't dare touch my sister! You know everything! Of course, I will touch her. But, do you really think I got her addicted to drugs for such a small reason? I am very much focused. It be getting married to you… or getting Janhvi addicted to drugs. I have a single agenda. To be the CM. Power. I killed your ex-boyfriend for that power, got married to you and stayed beside your father. What if something went wrong and revealed my secrets in the future someday? I got Janhvi addicted to drugs so that you and PKR would have no choice but to shut your mouths. There's nothing wrong with it, Satya. Sometimes it's not wrong to betray those who trust you for your benefit. Every bloody thing is fair in love and war. In this war, my only army is myself. Do you know what kind of hell I've been through having to stay with you alone? You used me as a weapon against Brahma. I used you as a weapon to become the CM. It's mutual. Satya… it's more difficult to pretend to be a good guy rather than actually being a good guy. I did my best. You broke bread with us… What about it? Finish it. I just broke bread with you in your house. But you got a taste of my love. Your sister had drugs… but your father had poison. Yes. I poisoned him. You concluded what you had to. Now listen to my confession as well. Your younger daughter Janhvi… May PKR live long. Satya, you say that… whenever you feel there's a vacuum in your life, I'm the one who fills it. But, in reality, I am the one who creates that vacuum. Basically… your entire family was born for me. They were born to make sure I would be the next CM. I have all the details regarding which drug peddler Janhvi brought her drugs from and who she was in contact with. Isn't this evidence enough? She could spend a minimum of six years under the charges of narcotics use. But if you tell me you have other plans, it's okay. I killed your father. Killing you and your sister isn't that much of a challenge to me. But I don't want the credit for killing every member of this family. Right now, to fill the vacuum in your life, you have no other choice but me. Hope you understand that. I live a peaceful life for 20 years. But he came back to ruin my peace. Why did you call him here? I want to do something good for this state but I am surrounded by enemies. To protect my ideals from their greed and atrocities, I needed Brahma's support. That is why I asked him to come. And he did come. He stayed beside me as a mountain of strength. You might not understand this today. But someday when you'll be surrounded by darkness you'll realize that the only person who can chase that darkness away is Brahma! There he comes, the brilliant sun Around which our world revolves Here he comes, there he is The one who inspires fear and awe Here he comes, there he is… The strongest one of his times Who faces many obstacles Here he comes, there he is… The one who protects the world He never lets go He never lets go Neither does he condone wrongdoing Neither does he condone wrongdoing A brave one who acts And writes history with his actions There he comes The steady one who brings goodness There he comes The one with a mind Of a genius and capabilities My dear… Brother. Did the darkness in your heart Melt and turn into tears? Has it turned into a river and flowed Toward attachment and affection? Tell me, dear. When you call him brother I want to see you, brother. It ties you to him And makes it a call for protection Certainly. It ties you to him And makes it a call for protection. No matter how many Kauravas You might have to face You only need one lord Krishna He is the one who is your ally And the one who will protect you Join hands with him and walk beside him You will walk into success We are in front of the person who wanted us to meet more than our very own selves. Dear, you are the only family I have. We should have been closer but my anger made me distant from you, brother. No, dear. You were always close to my heart. Tell me, dear. What happened? You start, dear. What happened, dear? I need to tell you something else as well, brother. Tell me, dear. To look at a person like you, a person like me needs to lift my head. But since you are in a situation where you have to hang your head in shame, I will say this bravely. The drugs that your sister consumed, the contacts with drug peddlers, call recordings, and even the hospital reports of yesterday are all on this mobile. I did all this upon the directive of your husband. It's to get promoted. But, given the lust I have for you, this promotion is not such a big deal. That is why I cannot miss this chance. You are right to feel anger. But this must happen, isn't it? I know that you've lost the support of your husband. Even if you come to me or ask me to come to you. Give it some good thought. No. Just decide without thinking. You go home, dear. All these days you kept denying me and your hurt my poor little heart. These lips of yours… are the teaser for the entire beauty that you behold. When I saw how charming and hot you were in the soap operas, I would be thrilled and overjoyed. Today, I am going to show you what I am made of. Hey! What's that sound? I am innocent. Stop that soap opera acting of yours. I saw your acting skills in the 3332th episode of the soap. First, I'll deal with that and then I will deal with you. Why are you here? You tried to mess with me. I forgave you. You tried to mess with my family. Especially, my sister. Do you think I will keep quiet? Because of one mistake you made we are getting warnings instead of money from Jaidev The company, we and all our employees' lives are destroyed. Stop it, Ram. If I really worked according to my ethics, hundreds of families would be dragged onto the roads. So, here I am. I call it quits. Of all the mistakes, do you know what the biggest one of them is? It is making the people who did the right thing regret their actions. You are making the same mistake when it comes to Shwetha. Don't do wrong. Yes, sir. I was wrong when it came to your affairs. But isn't it hypocrisy when you point fingers at the media when the other three pillars of democracy are in the wrong, sir? Anyone can say that. But you cannot say that. The fourth pillar is the media. Your job is to show the wrongdoings of all the other three pillars of the democracy. In our society, the people who steal are called thieves. What do we call those people who steal facts? Should we call them news channels? You guys add a lot of drama to the news, turn it into a puff piece with slow-motion effects and different graphic effects. To tell you the truth, the channels that offer the most entertainment are the news channels. You say, "Okay, Ram". You claim that you did wrong because you have a lot of debt. I will take care of all that debt. Will you be able to stay true and honest? The debt isn't a small amount, sir. It's 45 crores. Is that enough? From now on, the editorial policy of the NNTV channel should be as dictated by Satya Priya. You are not dealing with Jai who goes back on his words. You are dealing with Brahma who will not spare your life if you go back on your word. Sir, there's blood on your shirt… Since I am a farmer, a little mud stuck on my shirt while I was weeding. I gave you all the files that I have regarding the 100 MLAs. Now I have nothing. What have you come back here to take? We didn't come here to take anything. We came here to give. Brahma asked you to watch the movie that's in here first and later, show it to all the other MLAs in your fold. -Movie? -Yes, sir. What's the name of the movie? KCPD. KCPD? Yes, sir. What does it mean? Take a look. You would know. K. C. P. D. When did you shoot a movie in secret, sir? Well, very recently. When the women in my house heard that I was attending a movie preview, all of them made a huge fuss. They all wanted to be here. -Since you didn't invite them… -That's really good. This isn't a family-oriented movie. Come in. I thought as much. I knew that you had great talent It must be a glamorous movie with a lot of item songs. You must have made very little use of clothes. Not just the clothes, we used a lot of R-rated bits in there. Come on and sit down. Come. -KCPD! -Greetings. -Greetings. -Greetings. Did you bring samosas with you in the bag? I didn't come here as an MLA. I came here to remember the days when I used to sell black tickets in the theater. As soon as your name flashes on the screen as the producer of the movie, the entire theater is going to burst -in confetti made of paper. -Okay, good. Please, head in. You are going to miss the titles. -Yes! -Please go and sit inside. My dear MLAs. Now the movie is going to start. There are a lot of scary images in this movie. If anyone amongst you has heart problems, please don't be shy and have your medication. It's nothing we haven't watched before. -Just start the movie. -Yeah. -Yeah. -Start. KCPD! All the characters and events in this movie none of them are imagined. All of the events are true. If you could all find it in yourselves to be magnanimous and give me an hour of your time, I will give you Ugadi, the Telugu new year, and almanac predictions according to your moon sign. Looking at the corrupt activities you all indulged in, I feel like I might be tempted to take the corrupt route as well. That's because the figures of your corruption are quite tempting. First, the respected Krishnaiah Chaudhary. His Swiss bank account, the hotel in London, the 13000 crores worth of property that's hidden under some four to five people's names. Brother, are you alive or dead? I feel like I might be dying. Just wait for five minutes and I will book a coffin for you. Next, Mr. Gopal Reddy. A power plant in Singapore, and a cargo ship container in Indonesia. -Next, Mr. Veer Naidu. -Mr. Varma. -Thousands of acres of land in Uganda. -What is this? You put that all under your youngest daughter's name. We will discuss the details later. Now, Mr. Kondal Rao. Apparently, two mountains have been missing from your village. I have a list that contains details of what you did with those colored stones. -Stop it! -Stop that now! -Stop it! -Hey! -Don't shout and make a fuss. -Stop this! Every one of you has a character in the movie and all of you have dialogues in this movie. Sir, you don't know. You made a blockbuster, sir. There are bitcoins, blockchains, betting in cricket matches, sex scams, videos of sexual abuse… -and many more videos. -Stop it. -Mr. Varma! -Look at this! You've taken your share and now you blackmail us? I saw this video over ten times. We have no way of escaping from this. If your pigtails are in my hands, my head is under his feet. Tell me who the hell is he and I'll see the end of him Why did you stop? Go ahead and shout… bark even. You call this barking? Do you think we are dogs? The people elected you… so that they can bear with the atrocities you commit and the injustice you thrust upon them. What is this? You play movies like this and threaten us? Yes. I am threatening you all. If you admit to your mistakes, this matter will end with just a private show. But if you are adamant and rebel, this will turn into a public show. With this, I will make sure that the public strips you all naked and beats you all black and blue. All these days, each one of you have been eating away at the public funds with stupid contracts related to land, sand, mountain, water, alcohol and turned very arrogant and selfish. From today on wards, I am taking the contract that lets you breathe the air. There is only one rule in that contract The decision to give the public a good government. The only thing in your heart should be the fear to commit any wrongdoing. If not, you will all die. Hello? Satya? Where is Janhvi? I know you are the reason for all this Where is Janhvi? Smart. I heard that you and your brother have reconciled. Very well. It would be better for me. I want you to do this. The 100 MLAs on your side and the 40 MLAs on your brother's side. Get a total of 140 MLAs to agree and announce that I am the CM. If you do that, Janhvi will be at home in an hour. But if you don't agree to it and are up to some tricks… you know me. Thanks for your support. This support is not just for you. It's for ourselves as well. When our consignment was hit, Lucas got an anonymous call. He was warned not to go near the Telugu-speaking state. He is completely upset. No matter who obstructs our way, Lucas is coming here directly to take care of it. So you are lucky.

Everybody! Mr. Masoom? Hello, brother! It would be foolish to give your life for these white men. Sir, don't interfere. This doesn't concern you. I will handle it.

In the court of GodFather, the one who does wrong will always be punished. Brahma, I am a demon I will never die alone. Brother. Kill her Are you done? Things will not go as you planned because this isn't your strategy. This is Brahma's strategy. The only reason you were alive this long is because of my sister. It's as you said This is a family matter. This is a gift from our family. We openly admit the wrongdoing of Jaidev's links with the drug cartel, That is the honesty of our party What are you going to do to Jaidev now? We must do something But he is not here anymore He ran away from the country because all his secrets spilled out. The only person who is capable of carrying forward the ideals and vision of PKR… Mr. Brahma, who is the biological son of PKR I am proposing him as the CM of this state. JANA JAGRUTI PARTY JANA JAGRUTI PARTY To all the members of the Jana Jagruti party and to the special invitees and the media, I heartily welcome you all. To ensure that the future of the state is bright and moves forward in the right direction, we have organized this historical meet. In this regard, I lay in front of you, an important proposition. For the bright future of the public and for upholding the ideals of PKR, and carrying forward the ideals and character traits of PKR… I, Satya Priya, the biological daughter of PKR, take up the responsibilities of the position of CM.

You hear that applause? I took this decision because you are both capable and deserve the position. How will I do this without you, brother? With our father's spirit, take charge of the state and look after it well. I will take care of your well-being. No matter how far I am, I will always be one call away from you. It was my selfishness that wanted you to be beside me. I very well know that… wherever you are, you are always with the people. All the very best. God bless you. Good evening, Mr. Qureshi. We'll be landing at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris in 25 minutes The temperature is 21 degree Celsius. Hi, sir. Here's your special drink. Thank you very much. Qureshi is back in action.
