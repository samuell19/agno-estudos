-Gimme your phone. -Cell phone. -You too. -Now! -Passcode? -It's 3423. -Passcode? -It's 3142. -Hey, Stefano. -Hi. The phones? This is no good, keep it. -Passcode? -It's 1506. -Passcode for this one? -It's 3142. -Bye. -Later, Stefano. Chocolate. Cookies. Whipped cream is a must! -Like these? -Sure do. Not those. -Those! -All right. Those too. Just one bag. Those. -Should be enough. -We're fully loaded. You know my dad gets back tomorrow. -Where'll I go? -Dunno, back to group home. No way, -it's like jail. -What can I do? Talk to your dad, see if I can stay. He'll say no, trust me. -Just try. -No, trust me. -If you don't even try... -He'll say no, trust me. -There's nothing I can do. -Fine. -Gimme your phone. -Hey! -My dad's a cop. -Who gives a shit. Gimme. Here. Stop! Stop! Hands up, freeze! Hands in view, get down. Good. DECEMBER Hey, baby, what's your name? What's your name, baby? -How are you, sunshine? -Fine, and you? Hey, Valentina! I'm here, honey! Valentina, you can't! Knock it off. Damn it. Di Nardo? Rusticz? -I'm here. -It's time for the meeting with parents. -Guard, did my dad come? -Did I call you? No. So nobody's here for you. He's not reachable. -He said he'd be here today. -Something must've come up. -Try again next week. -Can't you try again now? -You took my deodorant! - No! -I smell my deodorant. -You're wrong, it's just soap. You dummy! Bitch! Fuck! -Hi. -Hi. -What happened to him? -He punched a wall. And today's his birthday too... Give us a smile then. A smile? I'm turning 18 in jail... Let's go. Come on, Daphne. -What happened to you? -I slipped in the shower. -Where does it hurt? -Here. Sit down and take off your shirt. Careful. I'll help you. Breathe deeply. -Does it hurt? -A bit. Go ahead. That's my deodorant! -Give it back, thief! -Hey, stop! Kick it. Ball! -Ball! -Pass the ball, please. Ball! -Can you pass us the ball? -Pass it to us, please? Guys, away from the fence. What are you doing? Your loss. Move it. Hey, can you pass the ball to the guys? Are you in solitary? -What do you think? -Why? Piss off. Why did you punch a wall? Because of my girlfriend who's in Milan. Why, did she cheat on you? If she does, I'll kill her. Why then? What does it matter to you? Well, I've got fuck all to do. She wrote a letter saying she can't carry on like this. I tried to call her but she didn't pick up. I waited a week to call again but she doesn't give a shit. It pissed me off so much that I punched the wall. Why are you locked up? -Robbery, and you? -Same thing. -How much longer? -Two months. Earlier, if the judge sends me to a group home. -Talk to her when you get out. -Haven't seen her in four months... I can't just go looking for her. I'll talk to her if you want. -You could do that? -Sure, I can find a way. Come here. What'd you say? I can find a way, but it's not a favor. -No problem. -Got an MP3 player? No. -Cigarettes? -Yes. -Who gives you money? -My mom sends checks. Then leave her number and two packs of cigarettes in the cart. Perfect. Nice to meet you, by the way. I'm Josh. Daphne. -Morning, ladies. -Morning. Don't touch those or we'll get a demerit, bitch. Mind your own fucking business. He's not reachable. Daniela. My dad's not picking up, can I call another number? -Whose? -A friend's. -The judge has to authorize it. -Then I'll submit a request. It'll never be accepted. If I say it's my sister's number, will you sign my request? No. Who's the newbie? Quiet, girls. You'll meet her tomorrow, be quiet. -Go in. -What's her name? -This is your cell, are you hungry? -Kind of. Bonori, if you have anything, give it to her. Goodnight. Hi. -Irene. -Not there, the bottom shelf is yours. -Why are you here? -Drug dealing. -Why are you laughing? -I've never been to jail before. -Got an MP3 player? -No. -Are you sure? -Yes. I said, I don't have one. Let me see. -Got any others? -Yes. Do you have any? This one. Nice. And this. -Who did yours? -I drew them. I'll steal a needle from the shop and you'll do one for me. Sit here. -Did you get your paperwork? -Yes, this morning. What's it say? -Drug dealing. -I got aggravated theft. -Me too. What's your name? -Irene Mancini. -Valentina. -Ferida. -Nice to meet you. -Sara. -Ambra. -Irene. -Gessica. -Irene. -Brenda. -Marta. Let us stand. Pray, brothers and sisters, that our sacrifice may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father. -The Lord be with you. -And also with you. -Lift up your hearts. -We lift them up to the Lord. Let us give thanks to the Lord, our God. It is right to give him thanks and praise. Lord, you are holy indeed, with these youths gathered here, make these gifts holy by the power of your Spirit so that they may become for us the body and blood of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. No, I want some rhinestones, they're cool. Irene, pass me that box. -Where do you want them? -Right here. -If you like these... -Yes. We'll put them here on the pleats. And then... We just have to hem it. Ikram, pass me a pin? Thanks. -We'll shorten it a bit. -Yes, it's too long. -Can I use the bathroom? -Yes, but you'll join us after? Of course. Hello, Caterina? You don't know me, I'm calling for Josh. He wants to know why you won't answer his calls. Hey, did you call me? Yes, I managed to talk to your girlfriend. What'd she say? She said it's over, goodbye. Over? She said you wrote her a letter threatening her. What the fuck did you write? I wrote that, if she cheats on me, I'll slash her face. -She was right to dump you. -Right? Yes. Daphne! Well, I gotta go. Do you call that love? -What? -Not seeing someone for months and considering them dead. -I don't know. -Do you have anyone outside? No. This is the juvenile detention center, who's this? Hold on, I'll put your daughter on. Go ahead. Dad... Hi. I'm out of clothes. I have three pairs of underwear left, who will I ask? Soon when? Visiting hours are in two days. Can you bring me money for cigarettes? And an MP3 player. Will you bring me one? Yeah, I'm fine. Don't forget the MP3 player. Okay. I'll be waiting. Bye. That's good, but a bit neater. No, pull it all back. Pull it all back and make it neater, okay? That looks good on her head, leave it there. Will you do my hair too? Take a seat. -I'll give you some highlights here. -Okay. Stefania and Lele, her son. -Hi. -This is Daphne. I brought you underwear, the guard has it. -Size small, right? -Yes. See? I told you. What happened to your hair? They gave me some highlights during our hairdressing class. Looks good. Thanks. So, how are you doing in here? I've gotten used to it. And you, outside? -No, I'm not used to it yet. -No? After being locked up for seven years, plus eight months of house arrest, it's not easy you know. -But he's making great strides. -Yes, I'm better. I'm better also thanks to this angel God sent me. -Did you remember the MP3 player? -Yes. I gave it to the guard. I brought mine, I don't use it. -Thanks. -Dunno if you'll like the music... That's fine, I just needed to have one. -I'll introduce you to Giordana. -Who's she? The supervisor. -Giordana, this is my dad. -Hello. -Giordana Angelini. -Ascanio Bonori. Stefania. This is my son, Lele. Tell him about the alternative. If you're willing, there's an alternative possibility. Which? What do I have to do? I still have a year left... But if I request probationary custody with you, I can get out. Your daughter would go home and we'd try to work out a plan that's suitable for her. Yes, but this is a delicate moment for me... I had my trouble, now Daphne has hers... -We know. -Then you also know... I can't leave home from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.... And I live with her. My house is small, there's our room and my son's room. You tell me if you're willing or not. What do you think? What can I think? Dunno... Shall we schedule our first session? All right, let's schedule a session. "Hi Josh, hope you're doing well. I wanted to tell you something about me too. I first got arrested two years ago for robbery. They gave me community service at the pound, I had to take the dogs out for walks, even four at once. The manager would yell at me saying: 'Don't play with the dogs, they'll get riled up and won't go in their cages'. Then I got sent to a group home and I ran away. I robbed some more, then got arrested and ended up here. My dad was in jail too, I just saw him today, he said I could try probationary custody with him. It won't be long, we're almost out, hang in there. Daphne." Time for the girls, let's go! Look what my sister snuck in when she visited. Put it on me. Put it on me. Shit! Where'd you get it? Where'd you get it? Eyeliner and mascara aren't enough for you? Bonori? Bonori, if you want respect, show respect. Tell me who gave it to you. Fine, you'll get a demerit. Get out. Wait in the hall. Can I take them downstairs? Yes, everyone except for Bonori. -Come on, girls. -Let's go dance. Time to dance! You'll be my dance partner. This is mine. Mancini, let's go. Come on! -Can I go too? -No, you're staying here. -But it's New Year's Eve. -I don't care. You should've thought of that before. -Open up. -Stop it. -Fucking open it! -I'll lock you in. Lock me in then! -How are you? -Fine. I asked the guard to place trust in you. -Meaning? -She'll let you go to the party. You can't behave like that. You won't get probationary custody if you behave like that. -I know. -Do you? -Do you want to stay here? -No. So? So I'll do as you say. But let's go now, it's almost midnight. Folks, this year we have a special guest with us, Greta from Fame Academy . Now couple off, don't be shy. Wanna dance? Come on. My hands are sweaty. May I? -What did you do to you hair? -Why? -It looks good. -Not too trashy? Not at all. Six, five, four, three, two, one... Happy New Year! JANUARY "Hi, Daphne, we haven't know each other long, but I'm glad we're keeping each other company, and I hope our friendship grows stronger day by day." "Hi Josh, I want to leave you a positive memory of me, even if I'm not good at writing." "Hi Daphne, I'm writing again because writing alleviates jail. I'm glad you'll stay with your dad, make sure not to screw up or they won't release you." "Hi Josh, you alleviate jail for me too. At the party, when we were face to face holding hands, I realized something: I'd like to be your best friend so you can freely confide in me, without hesitation or worries." Bonori, give me that note. What note? Give me the note you put in your right pocket, I saw you. Give me it or you'll get a demerit. -Give me a fucking demerit. -Want solitary again? Give me. -Can I read it first? -No, you can't. Go on. Good morning. Get up. In the hall now, girls. Hurry up. -Morning. -Good morning, girls. Reminder: secret letters between wings are forbidden. -We know that. -I just wanted to remind you. Who wants to take over Bonori's job? -What? -Mancini, do you want to? -Anyone? -Come on, please. -Don't you dare complain. -No more letters, I swear. -Sure, I wouldn't bet on it. -I swear. -Who wants to do it? -I'll do it. Good, go get ready. Di Nardo and Russo will serve breakfast. -I'll smash your face. -Sure... You'll smash whose face? Go make your bed. Stop it! Daphne... Daphne... Josh! -Goodnight. -Goodnight. Bonori, go to sleep. -I have to go. -Wait. Don't or the guard will come back. -I can't. -Come on. I can't. Good morning. Pizza, girls! -I want some. -I'm starving. -Thanks. -You're welcome. -Let's go. -Bye, have a good day. Awesome! She got a tattoo on her arm with my name. -You sure are crazy. -I am. Really crazy. How did you do it? I just did it. Listen... About that custody thing, I've been thinking about it. Now's not a good time, I'm not ready for a commitment like that. -Try to understand. -You changed your mind? Now's not a good time for him, he needs to take things slowly. So, you're leaving me in here? -Think I want to leave you here? -Yes. No! I live in her house, I have no job, how will I provide for you? Right, I'm an idiot for asking you. Listen, my house is small, but that's not even the problem. Was I talking to you? Just butt out! Your dad is finally starting to breathe easy. He can barely cross the street, let alone care for you! He said I could come home. Do me a favor, don't come here again! -What are you looking at? -I'm not looking at you. Hey, I'm talking to you. Don't you ever touch my daughter again, is that clear? -Talk to me, not her. -Don't attack her again, got it? She ended up in the infirmary! -Talk to me. -So did I. -Dad, enough. -I said talk to me! Ascanio, ignore him. What's going on? Shall I suspend visits? -No, sorry. -Everyone sit back down. -Shithead! -Calm down! -Stop it. -Sorry. -You jerk, bullying a teenage girl. -Ma'am! -I'm getting rid of it. -Why hurt yourself? You're getting out, I'm not. Look what I stole. Put it away, Daphne! I said put it away! -Where do you want to go after? -I still have a year left. When we meet up outside, free, where do you want to go? Where? To Ibiza. Where there's sun, the sea, parties... Rimini's the same, and it's closer. -Screw that, I want to go to Ibiza. -Then we'll go together, okay? I wish. -Tell me your dream again? -No. -Tell me, come on. -I don't feel like it. Tell me. We were sleeping together. You woke up. And started touching me... Down there. And then what? Then I woke up too. I turned around and... We started kissing. And you started undressing me. And then? You can imagine the rest. FEBRUARY One! Look at her! You never catch the ball! Girls, keep moving. Come on, go! Daphne! -Leave me alone. -We need to talk. -No! -Quiet, or I'll give you a demerit. -Go ahead! -Stop it. -Just sleep. -If you'd let me... Daphne! Stop a second! -Why are you doing this? -What? -Why are you doing this? -Who was she? -My ex. -Want to be with her? Then leave me alone. I didn't know she'd come with my mom, we don't talk anymore. -So what did she come for? -To say she'll wait for me. -Bonori, get in line. -What did you say? I'm confused. -I'm just a plaything. -No. -Don't jerk me around. - Come. -I never jerked you around. -It's over, enough. -I never jerked you around. -Enough! Mancini, come here, message for you. I'm going home. I'm getting out. Let's go upstairs. You have to pack your stuff. Coming together as God's family, let us ask the Lord for pardon and strength. I confess to almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters, for I have sinned through my own fault, in my thoughts and in my words... -In what I have done and what I have... -Daphne. Don't talk to her, it bothers me. It bothers me, don't. -What do you want? -Can I write to you? I'll leave you a letter in the cart. Stop it! Stay down. Don't move. Daphne, in the hall. Girls, everyone in the hall. After what happened yesterday, we'll have a separate male and female mass. -And my husband? -Blame your friends. Bonori, you're moving to a new cell. -Why? -You'll room with Di Nardo. Far from the male wing, so you'll quit shouting from the window. Russo, move to Bonori's room. Guard, I had nothing to do with it. I didn't do anything this time! -I don't want her in my room! -I'm not sharing with her. -I'll mutilate her, I swear. -Go pack up, now! This is my room, you'd better watch your step, is that clear? -You have to do me a favor. -What? -Put a letter in the cart. -Forget about it! -Morning, hon. -Please, it's important. Asking favors now? After telling people Brenda and I are a lesbian couple! Isn't it true? You kiss and sleep together, everyone knows. -So what's the problem? -There is no problem. Do 100 push-ups and I'll deliver the letter. -What, 100? -No biggie. Scared? Can't do it? One, two, three... Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen... Sixteen... -She can't handle it. -You're out of shape. If you deliver the letter I'll give you this. All right. But bring me the reply too. Play lookout while Brenda and I shower, if the guard comes, knock. Maria, the toothpaste? -Morning. -Morning. -Bonori, get dressed and come with me. -Why? They'll let you see Josh. Move it, sleepyhead. -How come? -Dunno. -Was it his request? -Dunno. Just move it. -Good morning. -Morning. Hi. Hi. I asked the warden for permission to meet with you. How did you convince her? Because I'm being transferred. -When? -I go back to Milan today. But before going, I wanted to say something to you. -What? -I wanted to thank you. You helped me get through jail, you stood by me. I don't know when we'll meet again, but I'll wait for you. Wait for me? I'm not going to sit here thinking about you, I'll forget about you in a week. I said I'd wait for you, we can be together in a year. I don't buy these fairytales. I'm even happy for you that you're getting out. We helped each other pass the time in here. That's all. Can I go, please? You won't even say bye? -Thanks. -Bye. Mr. Bonori? I'll put your daughter on. I can't take it anymore, I want to go out. Nothing happened. When will you come back? Next week? Promise? Yes, I'm calm. Okay, all right. Gessica? On medical rest, she gets transferred to the adult section tomorrow. Keep an eye on her tonight, okay? Otherwise she'll cut herself. Come with me. -Can I give her the cake? -Yes. Happy birthday. Come on, make a wish. -No, Brenda. -I made it for you. Don't do anything stupid tonight. -No. -Promise? I promise. I'm here. Wrap it up. -What time are they coming for you? -They didn't say. You brought her again? Can I have ten minutes alone with my dad? Fine. -No, stay here. -She wants to be alone with you. I said stay. Do you know why Stefania is here? -No. -Lele's First Communion's next month. So? Tell her. We wanted to invite you. We're having a reception at the beach... Your dad thought it'd be nice for you to come too. I spoke to the supervisor. If you submit a request, you can get a two-day furlough. -Really? -Yes. Are you happy or not? Yes. Thank you. You're welcome. -Want to see the Communion favor? - Sure. Are you happy or not? Yes, I'm happy. Excuse me, what did you give the inmate? Nothing, my son's Communion favor. -It's not allowed -It's a trinket, not a bomb. -I was just showing it to her. -It's not allowed. -You must follow the rules. -Chill, I didn't give her anything. Watch your tone, we're not sisters. Give me this. -Guards are like that. -Who'd want a sister like her! Come here. Behave now or they won't give you the furlough. -Look at me, understand? -Yes. I understand. Down. Good. Turn around. Your socks. MARCH -Hi. -How are you? Fine. -Sign here. -Thanks. The furlough expires tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. Be punctual. Yes. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. No, don't. They're still not here? Didn't you get their number? No, I didn't know they wouldn't show up. The number's on your phone from when they called. I don't know how to use these phones, you do it. Always get a number from the clients. All right, I'll shut this off. -Like it here? -Yes, it's great. Is it for me? Stefania picked it out. Try it on, there's a mirror by the counter. -Do you like it? -It's beautiful, thanks. -I'll put these away, honey. -Yes. Ascanio? Come play. Quick, it's starting. Don't cheat like last time. Hush or I won't play. That's how you do it. You can put your bag there. Damn it! The harder I swing, the slower it goes. You got busted. Damn it! Come on, we're losing! You're faking-out? -I'll wake her when I walk by. -Then put her in the living room. But I wake up early tomorrow, what'll I do? There's barely any room to walk by. - I'll get you a blanket. - Yes. Don't be like that, things are going well, aren't they? Yes, don't worry. Sorry... We don't have much room. No worries. Here... I'll double it up in case you are cold. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. We had a good time today, didn't we? Yes. Sleep now, we'll have fun tomorrow with all the people. -Goodnight. -Night. What the hell are you thinking? -I couldn't sleep. -So you just leave? I'm right here. I woke up and you were gone, you scared me. -Let's go. -No, I want to finish my beer. Finish it at home. Move it! I can't be here, let's go. They're staring at you. Let's go! Finish your beer. -What are you looking at? -I'm not looking, I'm waiting. All right. You don't want anymore? You're taking me back to jail tomorrow? What else could I do? You tell me. Done. Let's go home and talk there. There's nothing to talk about. -Why do you do this? -Do what? At this hour I have to be home! If they come by and check, I'm screwed. Understand? So go home. -I will and so will you. -No! -Move it! -Let go of me. -What's going on? -What are you doing? What are you doing? -I'm Elena. -Ascanio. Ascanio, nice to meet you. -This is another sister. -Vasilika. Ascanio Bonori, hello, this is my daughter. -Hi, Elena. -He's my boyfriend. Hello. This must be the "Our Father". -It sounds like it, right? -Yes. The dress looks good on you. Thanks. For real. Does he know the song? Does he know the song? Boy, my ears are bleeding! -Isn't she great? -Yes. -What time do you have to be back? -At 7:00 p.m. We still have a few hours. Good job, honey! Great job, Stefania, you're amazing! More music! Hi, it's Daphne, Josh's friend, remember me? Sorry for waking you, I wanted to know how he's doing. Do you know where he is, in a group home? Do you have his phone number? Where does he work? Can I have the address please? How'd you find me? Let's leave. I have to be back at the group home by 7:00 p.m. I have to go back to jail, the furlough expired last night. What do you want to do now? Dunno, but I don't want to go back. You'll be charged with escape. I know. That's six more months. I know, but it's worth it to be with you a bit. Where do you want to go? To Rimini, right? Rimini? -Yes. -For real? Yes. Tickets, please. Thanks. Wake up, wake up. Good morning, tickets please. Good morning. We don't have tickets, they were in my wallet that got stolen. You can't travel without tickets. I know, but I didn't even have time to file a report. -Can I see your IDs? -No, they were in my wallet. -Both of yours? -Yes, everything was. -I have to call train security. -What? -Listen, please... -Sit down. We'll get off at the next stop. There are two kids with no tickets or IDs, come up here. -We'll get off at the next stop. -Sit down, please. We'll get off. Good morning. Go! Come on!
