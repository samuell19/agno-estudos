(Birdsong) (Boy) Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall And all the king's horses and all the king's men Couldn't put the pieces together again Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall Humpty Dumpty had a big fall And all the king's horses and all the king's men Couldn't put the pieces together... Where did this filth come from? Answer me, answer me! What I have to put up with! You dirty minded little brat! Playing with filth like this. Just like your father. If you don't watch out, that's who you're going to grow up like. And I could tell you a couple of things about him. Bastard! I'll kill you if I ever find stuff like that in the house again. Go get a plastic bag, I'm gonna burn everything. Don't just stand there, go get a bag! I'm gonna put a stop to this once and for all. Pornographic magazines. I bet he has more stuff all over the place. Hurry up stupid and bring me a plastic bag to junk this stuff. (Screams) (Doorbell rings) (Telephone rings) (Sirens blaring in distance) (Doorbell rings) (Loud banging) (Woman) I just know there's something wrong, he's too quiet! Jesus, will you look at this? (Officer 1) Something's been butchered up here. (Officer 2) Let's hope it was an animal. (Officer 1) I never saw so much blood. Well, we better search the place. Oh, it's Mrs... It's Mrs. Reston, I knew it! I knew something awful had happened. Oh my god, oh my god! Get her out of here and call the station. And little Timmy! (Distant cries) You ready? Big man, big man, Mummy! - (Timmy) Mummy! - (Woman) Oh Timmy! Where's Mummy, where's Mummy? Take it easy kid, you're safe now. Where's the father? He's away, in Europe, with the Air Force. But there's an aunt, she lives in an hour away. I'll call her and take him over there. - Where's Mummy, where's Mummy? - Oh, this is terrible. Hi! - (Man 1) Hello. - (Man 2) Hi Debbie! (Screams) (Glass breaking) And all the king's horses and all the king's men Couldn't put the pieces together again (Chainsaw whirrs) Hey, you gonna be long? If so, I'll move somewhere else! Just a few minutes, Miss. Ok. (Whirring continues) (Screams) I'm sorry, Lieutenant. You can be sure the Dean will be with you in a few moments. That's all right ma'am, we're used to it. Did you know the girl? Oh well, no. Not really. You see, we have such a big campus here. It's very difficult to remember everybody. (Intercom buzzes) Yes, sir? Are those two gentlemen here yet, Grace? Yes, sir. Oh good, I'm just finishing up. Right, sir. Ah... Inspector Bracken. - Lieutenant. - Oh, of course. Sergeant Holden. - How do you do, Sergeant? - How do you do, sir? Won't you come in? Grace, hold all calls for the time being, will you? After you. Have you heard the latest? They've just installed a water bed in the training room. Have you ever been laid on a water bed? The most beautiful thing in the world is smoking pot and fucking on a water bed at the same time. (Laughter) (Whispers) Here he comes. Watch this. (Laughter) Oh Professor Brown, excuse me sir. Can I ask you something? What are the pectorals? My friends all laugh at me, they say mine are funny. I assure you, you have nothing to worry about. Thank you sir, but where are they? Here, right here. (Laughter) I never hire anyone without checking their references. I assure you, they are all above... Such a terrible thing this killing. The police are in there now. They think it's one of the staff. Huh, I see you have inside information. Well, we're all curious. What makes them think that? Well, the Lieutenant said it looks like an inside job. Poor Willard, the gardener who found the body. Imagine, still haven't found the head. Wonder what the murderer wanted with it... - You know what I... - Are they gonna be long? I don't know, Professor. They've been in there quite a while, so they shouldn't be long. But if you'd rather come back later. (Intercom beeps) Oh Grace, would you try and find Professor Brown for me, please? He should be in the faculty room. He's sitting right here, Dean. Should I send him in? Oh, by all means. Yes, send him in, please. Yes, he's unmarried and lives with his mother. Ah, I'm glad to see you Arthur. Come in. - This is Inspector Bracken and Sergeant... - (Holden) How do you do? - Lieutenant, Holden. - How do you do? Do you have time to show them around the campus? When is your next class? Well, as a matter of fact, tomorrow. Oh, good, good. They... They want to ask you a few questions about the Palmer girl. She was attending your classes, wasn't she? Professor Brown is in charge of our Anatomy Department. Please show them anything they may wish to see and... do come back to me gentlemen, if there's anything more you need. I only ask... one thing, that you keep all this as quiet as possible. Think what would happen to the university if this were leaked to the media. Don't worry sir. At this point of the investigation, it wouldn't help us either. We'll do our best. Well, I'm sincerely glad to hear that, for all our sakes. Our version here amongst the alumni and staff will be that it was... an unfortunate accident. Well gentlemen, I've seem to be doing rather a lot of talking and I do have a lot of work to do. I'm afraid I can't be very helpful. I can hardly remember the girl. I have so much work this semester. Oh come now, Arthur. You only have one section to look after and I have this whole blessed campus to think about. And I'm sure you'd be much better at this than I am. Well gentlemen, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to excuse me. Professor Brown will take care of you. Thank you Dean Foley, you've been most helpful. You're welcome. Do keep me in touch. Anything comes up, we'll keep you informed. So you say you didn't know her very well? Match? Give it up, Lieutenant! Professor, you have any idea what kind of girl she was? Did she run around with guys? You know, things like that? I'm afraid I never pry into my students' private lives. - Now this is my classroom. - After you. I teach Comparative Anatomy to be used in Anthropology and related subjects. (Chuckles) It was a present from one of the students. God knows where he got it. It's the skull of a girl about 16. I'd like to see that kid. What's his name? Oh, it was years ago, back in the 60s. You mean it might be one of the boys? Who knows at this stage? We're just out buying clothes without labels and trying 'em on for size. Do you know anything about the girl's friends? Well, I think she was quite popular. I suppose it could be one of the students. Shall I proceed with the tour? Well, thanks very much. But first I wanna read the coroner's report. Sure. (Chainsaw whirrs) (Whirring stops) (Chuckles) Willard? Willard, when do you expect your work will be finished here with us on the campus? I don't know, maybe in a week or two, maybe more. You don't have to worry it won't cost you any more. That's the deal I made with your secretary. - I ain't getting paid by the hour. - Yes, Willard, I know, I know. But in that case then, the sooner you finish here, the sooner you will be able to... to accept another job... elsewhere. I think that's only good business. - (Dean) Wouldn't you say? - (Willard) That's for sure. - I'll be as quick as I can. - Good, good. (Girl) I want to do it underwater, see you in the pool. - (Girl 1) Hi. - (Girl 2) What's going down? You've been studying? Two hours of European History, I'm going to the pool! There's our favorite Professor. (Girl 3) How'd you like to make it with him, Susan? (Susan) Are you kidding? - The campus closet queen. - (All laugh) (Girl 2) Oh, that's not nice, I think he's a sugar plum. (Girl 3) Down girl, you know what they say about sugar? (Susan) Crazy, bye. - Yeah. Take care. - What do they say about sugar? (Susan) Kendall? (Screams) (Chokes) (Gasps) (Chainsaw whirs) (Screams) Have you seen Kendall? Yeah, sure, he's right over there. Thanks Francine, by the way are you free tonight, huh? Hey, so I'm slayed by a withering look? Who gives a shit?! Hey Kendall, I've been looking all over. - This is for you. - What is it? It was left for you in the Dean's office a half hour ago. I've been looking all over. Where did you get to? Next time Grace wants something delivered, she can just forget it. Shit! When did you get this? - I thought I told you, a half hour ago. - A half hour? What's going on? Don't tell me I'm the bearer of bad news, I could kill myself. - Nah, it's all right. - Good, I'm too young to die. (Heavy breathing) (Grunts) Get him! Hold it! Or I'll blow your brains out. (Camera rolls and clicks) What a job you people have. The public doesn't realise how awful it is. Thanks for coming, Professor. Hey Hank, bring it over here. Now look Professor, I don't want to wait for the coroner's opinion. So could you give me yours? Now, could that have been done with a chainsaw? Like that one over there? Don't touch it, Professor! You could have destroyed some evidence. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Well, I'm not a pathologist but even a layman could see it was done with this. I'd say it's elementary. Ok, thanks. Thank you very much, that'll be all. You're welcome. Do those two boys know I want to see 'em? - It's in the works, sir. - Well, let's go see the Dean. - What's the matter? - I don't know. I guess this case is giving me the creeps. Me too, I wonder what the hell he's doing with all the pieces that are missing? That's what I mean, it's creepy. Look, we'll have to put some undercover agents in here. Fix it up with the Dean when we see him. - Girls you mean? - Yeah, of course! That's what he seems to be after. - Well, I'll be seeing ya. - Yeah. Myron Swartz, Kendall James. The Lieutenant wants both of you to report to the Dean's office a half hour from now. We suspects or he just wants to consult us? Don't worry, we'll be there! I hope so, for your sakes. Not a word to anyone. Does that mean we need an attorney? Ok. Ok, officer! You see, I'm pretty sure the murderer is someone on or around the campus. But surely you... you don't suspect one of my faculty members, Lieutenant. It could be anyone. The point is, will you cooperate? You want to place two of your police women, on my staff, to spy on everybody. That's asking a lot! There have been two murders now. That maniac is gonna kill again. This may be the only way we have of catching him. Yes, I suppose it is. In that case, when do you want them to start? I'll let you know. Now, I'd like to talk to your secretary and the two boys. Hey, listen man, do me a favour and don't mention it took you over a half an hour to find me. - The cops will have a hay day... - So I don't think you sawed up Susan, but where the hell were you? You know Alicia? That blonde in Anthropology? You made her too? Wow, Kendall, how do you do it? I just whistle and they come running. So here I am with Kendall James, the campus stud... Come on Goggles, I'm not that bad. So, you... found an envelope, on your desk, for Kendall, marked most urgent? Yes, and I took it to directly to the Dean. Didn't I, sir? And? I'm sorry but is all this really necessary? Why don't we ask the parents of the two murdered girls? Yes, of course, of course you're right. Well, I gave orders to Grace that she should deliver the letter to Kendall, right away. Why was that, "right away"? No one is allowed to use my office as a mailing address. All the students seem to think that the only thing important in life is what interests them. So when the letter was found, I naturally presumed after reading what was written on the envelope it was what it appeared to be. Very urgent! Look, I'm sorry, sir. Beats me why Susan would use your office for something like that. That note was sent by the killer to make sure you didn't show up at the swimming pool. Why did you show up? Well, sir I just... had this feeling. Something fishy. I don't know why. Just didn't feel right, sir. Ok. You got anything to add to that? Who me? I don't know anything. Honest. All right, now listen both of you. I don't want you talking about this. Not a word, it's very important. - Do you understand? - Yeah, sure. Here, I want you to give me a call when you feel better. There's someone at the office who wants to talk to you. Ok, sir. I don't have anymore questions. How about you? (♪ Upbeat pop music playing) ♪ Running around what are you doing here? (Heavy breathing) ♪ Wasting your time it's getting awful near ♪ Leave it to later and you will want to cry ♪ (Teacher) One, two, three, four and one, two, three, four, and one, and two, three, four, and five, and six, and seven, eight.

Go ahead. - Thanks. (Laughter) (Heavy breathing) (Scatting) (Humming) (Screams) My god, what happened? What a relief! You just scared the shit out of me. Sorry, come on. (Bracken) In you go, kid. Hi, Doc... How many times have I asked you not to call me "Doc"? (Chuckles) I'm a psychologist, not a doctor of medicine. Is this the boy? Hey, I don't need a shrink. (Chuckles) Come on. Call me what you like young man. I'm sure you don't need my services. It's all right, all Doc wants is some information. About what? My name's Jennings and I act as consultant for the department on cases like this. We try to come up with a psychological... profile of the killer. Yeah, the Doc's very good at it. Sometimes his profiles are the only place we have to start. But I don't know the killer. - Or do I? - Exactly! You may but without being aware of it. Now, if the Lieutenant will kindly leave us alone, we might be able to come up with something. Ok, Doc. - See me before you leave. - Ok. Take a seat. Is this job dangerous? Very! Good, then I'll do it! I am bored to tears with this place. Figures. Put an active lady in an office like this, shuffling papers for six months and she'll volunteer to... do anything. - (Woman) Almost anything... - Jennings is finished with me. That wasn't so bad was it? Hey, aren't you Mary Riggs? Mary, Kendall James. I'm real pleased to meet you. I try to catch all your games. What's a tennis champion doing in this place? "This place" is my living. - What? You mean you work here? - I sure do. This is the lady I was telling you about. Mary is gonna work undercover at the university. - Meet your new tennis coach. - Oh boy, that's great! Look, I really appreciate you letting me help and trusting me. Catch you on campus. Look kid, all you have to do is keep your eyes open. Watch out for Mary, in case she needs any... needs any help. Sure, sure thing. Bye. (Phone ringing, typing) You know he's a good kid. He's had a rough time. I had a long talk with him. I'm sure he can help us. That's nice. Did you have to tell him about me? Look Mary, we're short handed. I've got no one I can send in there with you. - (Scoffs) - I trust him. - I'd stake my life on him. - And mine too, evidently. Well, I don't know what you're worried about. You'll be playing tennis everyday. You'll be playing so much tennis it'll be coming out of your ears. - Besides, we'll be watching. - (Officer) No, I'm sorry, miss. - (Woman) All I want is some information. - (Officer) No one sees the Lieutenant without an appointment. You really should have phoned first. - (Woman) Hey look! - (Officer) No, I'm sorry. (Bracken) What is it? I wanted a word with you, Lieutenant. You have a minute? - Well who are you? - Sylvia Costa, "The Boston Globe". What's happening at the university? I... I don't know what's happening. What... What's happening? Well, there are rumors strange things are going on. It seems some maniac is running loose... or something like that. Miss, there are rumors like that at the university every couple of months. Maybe so, but there's always a chance they could be true. There's talk that a girl has been killed. (Chuckles) Student body's imagination knows no bounds. Look, please excuse me miss, I'm busy. But Lieutenant... Look, why don't you talk to Ms. Riggs. Maybe she can tell you something about it. - (Announcer) 40, 15 - (Applause) (Announcer) Game set and match to Ms. Riggs. (Applause) (♪ Marching band music on PA) Ms. Riggs! I must say that was quite an impressive... performance. - Why thank you. - After you've changed there will be tea in the faculty room, if you'd like to join us. I sure would. That young lady gave me quite a work out. Oh come now Ms. Riggs, there's no need to be modest. I have the feeling that under your tuition our tennis players will all become champions. Do any of your staff know about me or what I'm supposed to be doing here? Not unless your Lieutenant has told them. Oh! Well, that's very good then. I'd like to have some time with you whenever that's possible. Oh yes, of course, my dear. But weren't there supposed to be two of you here on my campus? Well, I'm afraid there's only me. This kind of job is strictly volunteer. You're very brave, Ms. Riggs. I only hope that this whole wretched business will be resolved with a minimum of fuss. You know, it's very important. What's... What's happened to Willard? Well, we have to release Willard. We haven't got enough evidence, yet! Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt but could I talk to you for a moment? Unfortunately, I am far too busy to talk to anyone at the moment. Call my... It has to do with what's been happening recently. I don't know what you're talking about. Nothing's been happening, I assure you. Nothing out of the ordinary and if you don't mind, we're very busy. (Footsteps) (♪ Slow blues playing) (Heavy breathing) (Clanking) (Heavy breathing) (Echoed footsteps) (Thunder roars) (Gasps) Oh, it's you, sir. You made me jump. (Exhales) Oh, what are you doing? - (Chainsaw whirs) - No! Please, no! (Screams) - (Echoed screams) - (Thunder roars) - It's locked! For Christ' sake, it's locked! - Who has the key? Forget it! I'll climb in through the window and open it from the inside. (Kendall) Shit! Come on! Come on! Dammit! Come on, come on! Go call the Lieutenant, hurry! Come on man, there's a phone in the janitor's office. Dial zero for an outside line. - Sure. - Oh, God! (Sobs) All right, what happened? We must have scared him off, Lieutenant. She's still alive, now we can get that bastard! I hope you're right, son. I hope you're right. Send someone with her. I want a guard on that girl 24 hours a day, got that? Yeah, all right, Lieutenant. - Now, will you please give me a match? - Sorry, I don't smoke. - What are her chances? - I've done all I can. The massive shock has blocked her nerve center and loss of blood is in the rest. Not a chance in a million, sorry. Damn! Son of a bitch is out there somewhere, laughing at us. What's happened this time? Where did you come from? Where what? I said, "Where did you just come from?" - I was upstairs in the library. - Good! I'll be talking to you later. Oh, I was going to call you. There's been another, it's horrible. Listen kid, I'm putting in more patrols but they can't be everywhere. I want you to keep your eyes and ears open. I need all the help I can get. And for god's sake, keep a close watch on Mary for me. Ok. I know, I shouldn't be asking you this. I'm up a tree with this guy. I mean, he's mad! Ok, go on. Randy, I want you to run a complete check on the staff. Full background, in depth! And if you have to, use the department's full budget. Ok, Lieutenant. I figured you'd like that. But do your best job, pal. I don't think we have much time before the next one. (Screams) (Whispers) Mary! Shut up, will ya? You want to wake up the whole college hollering like that? Oh, Kendall. Why do you have to make such a big production for? Are you crazy? Oh, Kendall. Do you want us thrown out? Boy, anyone would think you're in bed with Chainsaw Charlie. (Mumbles) Hysteric. Oh, Kendall. I'll control myself Kendall, if we do it again. Come back to bed, huh? Hey! No, why are you getting dressed? Oh, honey, where are you going? What if you gag me, huh? I wouldn't make any noise then. (Rustling) (Heavy breathing) (Heavy breathing) (Screams) (Whirring sound) Hey, Ms. Riggs! - Kendall! - What happened here? Well, he jumped me. There he is. (Chuckles) Oh, hey, it's my Kung Fu Professor. What's the story, Chow? I am out jogging and the next thing I know, - I am on ground! Something I eat. - (Chuckles) Bad chop suey. So long! Take it easy. What are you doing here this time of night? The Lieutenant asked me to keep an eye on you. I saw you from the window but when I got downstairs, you'd gone. So, I went for my bike. Well, next time forget about the bike. It sounds just like a chainsaw. Well, now you're ok, I'll see you in the morning. Bye! Oh, no. Now... No... First, we'll look for my gun. - Then I'm going with you. - You're right. Hop on. (Heavy breathing) (Rustling) (Screams) (Screams) Well, thank you. You really saved my life tonight. I'll see you tomorrow, all right? Mary! Aren't you making... coffee? (Chuckles) Another time. Thank you. (Screams) Casanova! (Blows raspberry) (Moans) (♪ Marching band music on PA) (Heavy breathing) - (Chainsaw whirs) - You? (Screams) (Screams) Willard, what the hell is that music playing for? They must be testing the system. But who? I thought that was your job! No way, lady. I just take care of the grounds. All electronics are someone else's headache. Kendall, call the Dean's office and find out if they're testing that equipment. There's a phone in the janitor's room. Willard has the key. No one's allowed to use that phone. Come on, I'll take responsibility. Wait over there. - What was that? - What? I don't know, I thought I heard a scream or something. Where are the controls? That music's driving me crazy! Over there, follow me. Come on. These aren't my keys. Don't touch! They might have prints or something. I mean if anything has happened. (♪ Music stops) Kendall? Kendall? Kendall, where are you? (Sobs) What happened? Another one... in the locker room. It's Suzie Bellings. (Gasps) (Retches) You see it? Yes! While we were out here fumbling with that music! The lousy bastard was in there killing her! Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! He cut that poor girl in half while she was still alive. You have any idea the terror that kid went through? She was still alive for Christ's sakes. I know Lieutenant, I know, but I'm doing the best I can. If I go too fast, I might miss something. You just gotta give me more time. We don't have anymore time. Take some uppers or something. Just get me a lead, anything. What I need is some help. I've been going 23 hours straight but my eyes can't take it any longer. I'll do my best. Maybe I can get you some help. Remember that kid Kendall? I'll see if I can get him... get him down there to you. I thought I was tired. We can't use a suspect, you must be kidding? Suspect? You're crazy! That kid's clean and you know it. Look, he knows everyone on that college campus. He could smell something suspicious, faster than we can. I know, Lieutenant, I know. But the book doesn't! Yeah? Well, the hell with the book! The book says, get the killer! Now quit talking to me and find me a lead, dammit! (Yawns) (Heavy breathing) Professor! Professor Brown! Do you mind if I walk with you for a ways? I'm a little nervous after what's happened. In broad day light here in the middle of the campus? I don't think there is much to worry about. I'm going over to the Harton building. - Will that be all right? - That's fine. I know you must think I'm awfully silly. - But... after what I saw.. - Oh no, not at all. I suppose I'm so used to bodies. Dead ones that is. - I'm afraid I'm callous. - (Chuckles) Not like the Dean, huh? He seems like an old softy. Obviously, you don't know much about campus politics. Why do you say that? Because to survive on a campus this size, you have to be tough. I wouldn't bet on anyone's chances against the Dean. Still waters run deep, you know! You sound like you're talking from experience. Bitter experience. I was just expressing my feelings. - Tell me more. - Listen Ms. Riggs, you've only just joined us. But I think you know better than to pry into the personal lives of your colleagues. Well, I just like to know where I stand, Professor. After all, there is a maniac running loose. (Bells chime) - (Screams) - It's only me! I'm sorry, I'm just a little edgy right now, that's all. Where are you off to? The Lieutenant asked me to help Sergeant Holden go through some records down at City Hall. Well, well, isn't the Lieutenant unorthodox? Well. Say, where can I find the Dean about now? Oh, he won't be back until this evening. He goes to Arlington on the first of every month. But, you'll find him in his quarters around seven tonight. - Seven? - Yeah. - All right, I'll see him then. - OK. - And I'll see you later. OK. - Yeah. - Take care. - Bye-bye. Hi Sergeant, where do you want me to start? So you... wanna play policeman? Well my boy, let's see if your enthusiasm is still going strong in the wee hours of the morning. Do you smoke? No, why, does it bother you? I don't like having my environment polluted, especially down here. All right, what you have to do is simple. You read through those files, you make a note of any references to the faculty members, anything at all. Nothing to it. There, that's your table. Ok. (Doorbell rings) (Doorbell rings) Oh! Ms. Riggs, this is a surprise. - Well, I don't want to disturb you. - Won't you come in? Well, I just have a few questions to ask you. Of course, if you prefer, standing out here, all I can do then is to accommodate you. It is a little silly, isn't it? (Chuckles) Over there, my dear. Now, what would you like to drink? I'm just making tea but I expect you'd prefer coffee. Yes, that would be fine. - It's a lovely place. - You're very kind. I don't hear that very often. I have very few visitors here. Of course, it is rather large. You see, I live alone. Now, make yourself comfortable, my dear. I won't be a moment. Ms. Riggs, now, how do you like your coffee? With... cream and sugar? Cream, please. No sugar. A little saccharin, perhaps. Ah, watching your figure? I shouldn't have thought that was necessary. Playing all that tennis. - I'll put a little in for you. - Thank you. (Kettle whistles) It won't be a second. Here we are, my dear. I'm sorry it took so long. Oh, thank you, thank you very much. - Yes. - Here's your coffee. - Thank you. - It's, uh... It's instant, I'm afraid. It's fine, I love the cream. Oh well of course, this is New England. I'm glad you like it. Now tell me Ms. Riggs, what did you want to talk to me about? Professor Brown. Ah, Professor Brown. Yes. Does he have any sort of problems of any kind? Anything that would help. You know I hate to ask questions like this. But we need anything that we can get. Some more coffee, Ms. Riggs? Yes. That would be fine. You know, if we don't find out something soon, we'll have to get a warrant and search the entire campus. Well, I certainly wouldn't want the campus full of eager policemen searching for dead bodies or at least, the remains of them. This might be something, Sergeant. He's changed his name. Not much in that but we better follow it up. I'll call Arlington records, let's hope someone's there. It's pushing eight o'clock. (Holden) Arlington, this is Sergeant Holden of Boston homicide What can you give me on a guy called John Reston, 413 Cedar Drive? R-E-S. Right. Yeah, I'll hold on. You'd better keep working, this could take a while to go through. The guy on the other end sounds like he might drop dead at any minute. Yeah, I'm here. Yeah. Yeah, that's the guy. Are you sure? Could you get that information put on the wire right away? I appreciate it. I'll send you a case of lollipops. Right. Thanks a lot, huh? Thank you. Well, what did he say? What the hell? You're practically on the force anyway. The Dean's the one. Apparently, his mother was chopped up when he was a kid. It must have affected his mind. Mary! She said she was going to see him at seven o'clock. Holy mother of God! Come on, let's go! No, you stay here and call the Lieutenant. No, what am I saying? I can't think straight. We'll use the car radio. Come on Kendall, I need you! Now then, what were you asking me about? Ah, yes! Professor Brown. Your coffee. Professor Brown, you see... is a homosexual. I found out about it some years ago. But... As long as he doesn't break the rules, that's his affair. Brown seems more upset about his affliction than I am. I think I should tell you. He almost tried to kill me. But I'm very strong, you know. I feel funny. I can't seem to move... right. That's the effect of the drug I gave you. You can, of course, hear everything I say, can't you? But you can't move. Of course. Lieutenant! - Lieutenant. - What is it? I thought you'd want to see this telex right away, sir. It's a break in the college case. Tell Roger to get my car, right away! - We don't want to make a mess in here. - (Whimpers) Come on! There's the Lieutenant! You two, around back. (Gasps, sobs) (Whispers) That door there. You'd make a good cop kid but this is as far as you go. No, you can't do this to me now. - All right but you stay back. - OK. And if one of us shouts "down", you just hit the deck and ask why later. Stay back! Mary? Mary. What's wrong? Mary? For god's sakes, what has he done to her? There's no sign of him, Lieutenant. Let's go find him, he can't be far. Kendall, see if you can walk her around. I'm gonna radio in for a doctor and an ambulance. Come on. Try to walk, I'll help you. Come on, it's all over now. Come on, Mary. Come on, try to stand up. Come on, Mary. Come on. You can do it. Yeah, there you go. Come on. You see, you're walking. Not as difficult as you thought it was, right. Now, the other way. You're doing all right. That's it, pretty soon you'll be ready for the marathon. There you go. There you go. (Screams) (Grunts) (Gunshot) (Kendall) Thanks! - You all right, boy? - Yeah. You sure are lucky. How's Mary? She's gonna be all right. He drugged her. Get something and cover that. All right. Let's tear this place apart. Randy, you start in here. Hey, take a look at this. Jigsaw puzzle. For kids of all ages. She's not bad, Sergeant. Never thought the Dean would collect something like this. Real freak. Join the force, kid. We're finding out little secrets like that all the time. Really? (Screams) Get him out of here. - Where's the Lieutenant? - Gone to the hospital with Ms. Riggs. - Go get us some coffee. - Right. - Well, Kendall, how's it going? - My heart's beating again. - Still wanna be a cop? - Are you kidding? Come on, it's time you got some sleep. Don't brood over it, kid. Let's go. Hey, my jacket. (Screams) (Squelches)
