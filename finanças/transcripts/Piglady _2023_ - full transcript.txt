The girl, they ended up-- they never did find her body, but evidently they kept her-- she kept her somewhere in a pen like this. In 2007, Caleb Jones and his wife, Rachel, saw an ad near the Weimer store about help needing cutting wood. On the other end of that ad, Susan Worley. Just up the hill right here, that's where they found one of the-- like, an arm or a leg or something, just right over the hill there. And if you look, the barn there, it's torn down now. Jones says he and his wife eventually lived on her property. They set up a small trailer and helped her clean up the property and feed her pigs. And all of the sudden, Worley told them they had to go. He turned white as a ghost. I mean, you can see I'm getting chill bumps right now just thinking about it, because it's, like, whenever you're that close to somebody to escape death. Both of them remember her living conditions as being terrible. While there was running water on the property, both say there was no bathroom on site. Her living conditions were-- were crazy, because she let the pigs live in the house and they would run through and come and go as she pleased as... But there-- there was just something about her that was off, that just was eerie. And they say news of her arrest comes as a shock. There were warning signs definitely. She-- she was always nice to me. I remember down at the shelter, I was looking for work... Come on, you're almost there. Right there. Push. Push. Come on. Push. Come on. No! -With you. -Yeah. What else do we need? Like, did the boys prepare for anything? Yeah, prepare, like, bring beer. -This number keeps texting here. -Oh, my God, it's 818. That's, like, Burbank. -Ew, who lives there? -Oh, my God. -Jesus! -Looking good, ladies. -Looking good. -Oh! So my jiu-jitsu classes are paying off. -Girl, yes. -Hey, baby girl! -Looking marvelous as always. -Thank you. And hey, cutie! I forget your name. -I smoke too much weed. -Hurricane. -Don't ask why. -Yeah, don't. Girl, you're walking a pit bull on the streets of Hillcrest. I'm surprised a Karen hasn't got you yet. First of all, I am Black, gay, and I need emotional support. And, girl, you know we're in California. Why you got all that on like you a Eskimo? Oh, I'm Mormon now. -Is that sheep's wool? -Uh, yeah. Mormon. Girl, ain't no church gonna have your scraggly ass. So, we're going to my boyfriend's dad's house in Oregon, he's got a cabin up there. We're gonna have a little weekend fiesta. Adrianna, meet my friends. Marcus, Tyler, and the star of the show, Hurricane. Oh, my God, so cute. Wait, why is his name Hurricane? Don't ask. Please, please, please. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Um, you guys should come to the cabin with us, right? Yes, yes! I'm a city slicker. This ass don't walk in grass. And these heels don't, either. Well, I know Hurricane would like to get out -of the city for a weekend. -Yeah. Come on, do it for the dog. Babe, I've been to Oregon. And there's no place for my beautiful, sexy Black ass. Burning daylight, let's roll. How was it, buddy? There's a pandemic coming. What is wrong with you? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? I have a baby! Please, just leave me alone! Don't kill me, please. I'll do anything you want, please. Say something! What are you doing? That must be your prince charming. -Mm-hmm. -Well, Merry Christmas. I hope I see you guys soon. Please someone save me from these cannibals and meat eaters. Girl, you don't eat meat? I eat meat. Well, I don't swallow, but don't tell anyone. Bye! Love her. But speaking of secrets, does he know yet? No, and I'd like to keep it that way. I haven't decided if I'm keeping it or not. You've got to protect yourself, woman! Funny you should say that, Tyler. -I always say that to you. -Whatever. Okay, just text me if you change your mind, okay? Love you, love you. Bye, Hurricane. Girl, I love her, but she is crazy if she has a baby with that mess. -Who the fuck was that? -Just some friends. I was trying to get them to come up. You can't just invite people to my parents' cabin without asking me first. Uh, you're such a butt plug. What the fuck does that supposed to mean? Butt plug? Who has a butt plug? Of course that's all you got from that statement. Jesus, guys, we haven't even made it down the road and you're already fighting. All right, all right, all right, you're right. Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize. I have a chronic disorder of douchebag, but have no fear. I will protect you and I am strapped. Strap on? Well, I knew he was a perv, but not you, Brit. Oh, that shows how little you know about me. I know what you meant, tough guy. You want that. 45, that Jesus piece. ♪ That Colt 45 and two Zig-Zags, baby that's all we need ♪ ♪ Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong ♪ ♪ Smoke that tumbleweed ♪ Wait, wait, you have a gun? Well, I mean, I prefer a peacemaker, a heater. That's so unnecessary. Unnecessary until it's necessary. So what are you scared of, cowboy? I don't know, you know, vegans scare the hell out of me. Well, you should be scared. Listen, Adrianna, I know you hate me, but no matter what happens... I'm gonna protect you. Not because I care about justice, I just want to use my gun. Oh, is this the part where you tell us about your Second Amendment rights? Aren't you scared of getting arrested? They have something called licensing, so if you have a gun license and you're not with the liberal, we should be good according to law. Brittany, you must be a saint to be with this one. I'm sorry, I didn't hear anything. That's gonna be my number one tip when I become a dating guru. Using the excuse of being on your phone. Sounds like great advice. Well, I'll be your first patient, Brit. Just make sure to give me a good prescription. Do I hear two? I second the notion. Dibs on uno. Bullying and skipping line. Why am I not surprised? Anyway, let's be friends. I don't wanna get shot. Shake on it? Let's get fucked up. Here we go! Rock and roll! Morning, Susan. Sorry to bother you. I know it's early, but we got a few questions for you. Neighbors complaining? Not this time. Uh, we're just interested to know the last time you saw Doug Birchfield. Yeah, Dougie used to work for me. Like all of 'em. Made some money, got hooked back on the needle. Were you and Mr. Birchfield ever romantically involved? 'Course not. I ain't needed a man in years. Especially not a junkie. I'm starting to feel like you're up to something... and I don't think I like it very much. How many pigs you got, Susan? Besides the two on the porch... 30, 40. Pig's a very resourceful creature. -Hm. -A lot you could do with a pig. Yeah. Your dad was a pig farmer, wasn't he, Officer Raymond? He was. Well, you have yourself a great day, Susan. You think she did it? Well, she's already lying about their relationship. And look at this place. She's got every means to dispose of a body... including a homeless person. Easy write off. Don't do it. We need probable cause. But we'll get it. Bro, we should have a pig roast. Uh, you better fucking not. I'm down, dude. Let's do it. Hey, I heard you were the one to talk to about getting some work. I sure could use some money if you got anything. Who told you that? I-- I don't remember, it's just kind of the talk around here. I don't recognize you. Where are you from? Uh, California. Can you keep a secret? Of course, you can trust me. I could hire you on my farm... but I don't like people knowing my business. Yes, ma'am, I understand. Appreciate it, Susan. -You can't trust these people. -I-- I give you my word-- If you're gonna work for me, I gotta know I can trust you. I-- I give you my word, I'll keep it between you and me. Come by my place in the morning. Oh, thank you so much. -I won't let you down. -Hm. It'll be good. You won't regret it. Thanks! Nice talking to you. I won't let you down! Uh, all right, gang. I need a drink, let's stop here at the local Watering Hole. - What do you say? - I'm game. I need to stop by the store and get some booze, too. - All in favor say aye. - Aye! Got you a drink already, babe. Well, I wanted to change it up a bit. -Get something different. -Oh. So what's the plan, Captain? Uh, the plan is no plan, Corporal. I definitely want to do some lounging around. Get caught up on my beauty rest. How about you boys? I'd like to do some manly stuff. Maybe teach a boy here how to drive stick. What does being a man even mean? Bartender, another round, please. What? They work for me. No, seriously. What does being a man consist of? Oh, I think I would know. Yeah, it's probably eating a lot of meat, so your asshole just lights up. What is with you two and buttholes? I am the rubber band man for tonight. -Tony Tone! -I got drinks. But I need that, actually. Ooh, baller! Yeah, let's-- let's kill it while we're here, huh? Cheers. All right. So, what's your plan after school, Brit? The plan is no plan. How about you? I plan on starting my own practice. That's if I ever finish. I don't know, maybe I'll just be a professional student. No, you got this, you're almost there. How about you, Hunter? What's in store for the marine? I was always a little too cool for school. That's why I enlisted. But I don't know, I would like to start a family one day. Oh, that's so cute. A little baby Hunter. Baby Hunter. Tony! Party foul! No worries, Tony, I didn't need one anyways. -Sorry. -Were you a server? You're so cute when you're embarrassed. Fucking thing! I'm ready to leave after this round. Yes, please. We just got started, what do you want to do, Tony? I think I want the whole outdoor experience. Not this "watering hole" shit. We've been on the road all day, I'm ready to chill. All right, ladies. One more, then we go. -All right, cheers. -Prost. - Party pooping tonight. - What is this then? This is a drink. Too bad you're not drinking with us. -What's up with that? -What do you think this is? So can we leave? Sure, I guess. All right, guys, here we are. The door was open. This place is a pigsty. See, this is why I'm not nice to people. Look, maybe your water broke or something. Kind of creepy, but whatever. -Let's get settled in. -Adrianna, I think we have cucumbers if you want to put some of your eyelids. No, thanks, I brought my own facial masks. And by the way, we only have one room available, so me and Britt will sleep on the air mattress. You two can have the room. What's wrong with the other two rooms? One's my mom's art studio and the other has a bunch of shit in it. What kind of shit? Dude, I don't know, doomsday shit. Well, thanks, that's sweet. You're officially off my shit list. Yes! My life is complete. How about them cucumbers? You're bad. Man, that is a cool shotgun. Yeah, that was my grandpa's, he used to take us skeet shooting and bird hunting as a kid. Skeet shooting is kind of like our family sport. 1892 Damascus steel. 12 gauge. She is pretty. Please tell me you've shot skeet before. What, those little orange puck-looking things? Technically they're called clay pigeons, but whatever. Okay. Sweet with the skeet, bro. Let's do it to it. Okay, babe, we're gonna go play guns in the woods. Be careful, Hunter. -Don't shoot your eye out, kid. -Will do. Hey, take care of my man, capisce? Capisce, when I'm done with your man, he'll be shaking it with two hands. Saddle up, Tony. Famous last words, "I'll be back." Yeah. Just a second. Coming. Uh, hey. Randy. Uh, you've done a lot to help out around this month, so I was thinking, uh... you don't have to worry about the rent on the RV. Oh, well, thank you. I'll-- I'll do the best I can for you. I got supper ready if you wanna come in. Uh, no, I got-- I got things to do, but, uh, I appreciate all that you've done for me. Well, uh, I could do a lot more. You know, I couldn't help but notice your little habit there. What with you speeding around so much and all. So, uh... all right. I'll let you go, but, uh... just let me know and Mom'll cook you up something real good. Real good. So, what do you have against the Piglady? What do you mean? It just seems like you're hell bent on busting her. Is it personal? I just don't like her. She's a thief. She stole one of my dad's pigs. I'm pretty sure she poisoned my dog. Ouch. How long ago? I was just a kid. But you know what really pisses me off... is that she paints herself as this heroic philanthropist down at the shelter. Whatever. I feel you. Let's bust this bitch. Well, it is Christmas time. Seems to be bodies disappear this time every year. Do you really think she's behind this? I mean... a little petty theft is a long shot for murder. And besides, with all the trimmigrants working in the pot fields, it may be hard to quantify. It's just a feeling. It's just a feeling. You know how stubborn Adrianna can be. I don't know how you do it. What? Hunter. Thank you, Adrianna. It's no whiskey, but it'll have to do. It's like rubbing alcohol. -No, I'm good. -Ooh. So, how was shooting guns today, my little tough guy? It was awesome. Hey, Hunter. -Hunter! -Are you deaf? I saw an axe in the back of the shed. In the spirit of tradition... Christmas tree, anyone? Ooh, Hunter, I think you were right. Kind of digging my new manly man. Well, who's getting laid tonight? Who's getting laid tonight? Or today? Oh! Hint-hint. That'll give me something to look forward to, babe. But I need to chop a tree. Oh, we're not gonna do that. You gotta learn how to chop wood first, boy. Oh, I see how it is. So, you don't want it... now? Oof. Oof, babe, sometimes you want what you can't have. Well, it's fine. We need girl time anyways. Yeah, it'll give us a chance to talk about you. Go on, do your manly stuff. let's go. Let's grab our coats. First thing you need to know about chopping wood, it's all positioning on the handle. Be careful. Well, I need help with your cooking skills. I'm gonna make dinner. Sure thing. My pleasure. What're we having, captain? I was thinking something easy. Maybe spaghetti? They can have the meatballs after you get your food. -Thanks, babe. -Yeah. All right, let's clean this up. I love that they're getting along. Okay, so how can I help you with my cooking expertise? Hey, uh, man, I, uh, I think I'll take you up on your offer. You got me a little bit curious. You want a bump? Oh, wow, thanks. Hey, honey. I'm not gonna hurt you. I just need you awake for this. Uh, how long have I been out? Not long. Hey, why am I-- Hey, why am I tied to the bed? Hey, what in the hell? What in the fuck? Why am I tied to the bed? What in the fuck is going on? I want out of here! Why am I tied to the bed? I've seen you looking at me. What the fuck? What-- Are they smoking? Tony will take any opportunity he gets to roll a joint. They're so silly. -What are they even doing? -I have no idea. I'm gonna make a drink, do you want one? Maybe in a minute. Guys are so strange. I mean, how they go around roaring and beating their chest over nothing. I mean, it's almost primal. Yeah, it's almost as if they're subconsciously clinging to the last of their masculinity. I mean, I guess I shouldn't complain. At least there's some manly men left in the world. It does seem to be a dying species. I try and let him run free, but at the end of the day, he's such a moron. They need us to keep them tame. Tony would be lost without me. Or maybe we'd be lost without them. You wanna ask your mommy for permission? - Come on, dude. - Fuck you, dude. I got this. What? What is it now? Nothing, man. As you are, as you are. You gonna keep doing this every time that I swing? I'm happy you're cutting it, man. -Oh, man. Come on. -You're doing good. What, are you cold, pretty boy? How does that feel? Good. Well, let's finish the job. What is that? Do you see it? What? -Dude, I don't know. -Never mind, dude. Never mind. - Try that. - There she is. Oh, there it is. Timber! Tell me about that story, you know, what you were saying about the Piglady? Well, there was just some folklore around a couple of disappearances, one being her husband. Apparently, she would feed the victims to her pigs and she had an ongoing relationship with them or something, I don't know, Tony. -I don't know. -You mean like beastiality? You tell me she's a fucking pig whisperer. I think she just looks scary. I mean, I've been there a few times with my dad -and I'm still alive. -Hm. Besides, she wouldn't kill a customer. It's a bad business. Yeah, I don't know, I just don't want to piss off my girlfriend. Man the fuck up and grow some balls. That's what she secretly wants anyways, Tony. I don't think making eye contact with a flaming pig head is what she wants, bro. Well then she can get over it then. Here's what we're gonna do, Tony. We'll sneak out tomorrow after breakfast, we'll get the pig and the roast will take place far, far from the cabin. And that's as nice as I can be. Come on, let's do it. All right. You boys don't belong here. It's much too dangerous for you. Just passing by, bud. - What a view, huh? - Mm-hmm. That's what it's all about. What are we sipping on? Devil's gut. Cheers. To the pig lady. Skoal to experiences. Let's head back. Always leave a tool how you found it, Tony. Let's go sharpen this blade. Saddle up. Don't be modest, Tony. Come on. Should have power in here. Take that, so you can latch it back. Just latch that back when you're done, Tony. I got you. - Yo, Hunter, come here. - Yeah? Come here, come here, come here. What? I swear, I'm seeing things. I'm not crazy, I sw-- What the fuck are you seeing, dude? Come on. ♪ When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze ♪ ♪ For the holidays, you can't beat home sweet home ♪ ♪ I met a man who lives in Tennessee ♪ Oh, shit. Shh! Yep, yep, yep. What the fuck? We just cut this tree. Sorry. We found it in storage. We thought you guys were drunk in the woods by now. Actually, I thought you guys were doing some Brokeback Mountain shit. Oh, are you jealous? Just-- I'll put it-- Sorry, Tony. You had the experience at least. -Keep your head up, kid. -Can you guys replant it? No, we can't replant it. It's dead. We already cut it down. - That's not my problem. - Get out of here. ♪ If you want to be happy in a million ways ♪ ♪ For the Holidays, you can't beat home sweet home ♪ I think it looks good.

Like dead people? Uh, no, like pigs. And I know it sounds crazy. I swear, pigs running by the shed, by the jacuzzi. Is it the cute little pink ones with wings? Okay, whatever, Brittany. This looks good here. Oh, okay. Well, I think this looks good here. Oh, you do? And here and-- Should we just go upstairs? Well, let's do that, yeah. Let's go upstairs. I think-- I think so. I'm the only one fixing the tree over here. Good night, guys. -You want a bite? -No. -Are you sure? -Yeah. -You having a good time? -Yeah. Is this your version of a Christmas story? It's a little loud. Can you turn it down, please? They've got to be the most sadistic couple on Earth. Halloween on Christmas? Sorry, we must have fell asleep. I thought you were dead. You wouldn't get that lucky. All right, let's walk three feet to a bed of air. I'll have to say sex on the air mattress is new for me. It kind of turns me on. How about you? Turns me on maybe, but not a first. Ooh, competition. I like it. But be gentle with me. I'm innocent. I'll hurt you in a good kind of way. Some boys have all the luck. Tell me about it. But better yet, show me. That's the house right there. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother you. We actually just wanna purchase a pig from you. How big you want? Uh, uh, just enough to feed a few people. $2 a pound is typically what I charge. -You gonna haul it off? -Yes, ma'am. 100-- 125. Okay, uh, we'll take it. Randy! Yeah? Butcher these kids a suckling. Which one? One of the little ones. You want it butchered or killed? Uh, both, please. I'm sorry, you'll have to forgive my friend. He's not used to killing what he eats. We're gonna do the butchering. - California? - Yes, ma'am. Randy will take care of you. Hope you ain't got far to go. Nope, just over the mountain here. Staying at my dad's cabin. Over the mountain? Is your dad Henry? That's him. Tell him to quit calling, my land ain't for sale. I'll pass it along. I'm not here to take your land from you, Miss. I try to stay out of my family business. - But you have a good day. - All right. And you have yourselves a good stay. Thank you. Unless you boys want to hang around, I suggest you go wait down there if you can't handle the reality. We'll wait in the Jeep. Thanks. Dude. You told 'em where we were staying? Don't worry about it, Tony, I've been dying to use my weapon anyways. Something's not right with you, man, I figured you'd want to be out there. You know, watching him blow a pig's head off. Too up close and personal for me, Tony. I'm retired. But after the fact, no problem. Brit, did you fill up the hot tub yet? Of course, just like you asked. You're the best, babe. Did you even bring trunks? I got my boxers. I think it's gonna rain. Ah, they have a saying in Oregon. Wait five minutes, the weather changes. Okay. Tony! Hot tub in five. Adrianna! Hot tub in ten. - 10-4. - It's a date. Oh, what a life, Tony. Oh, my God. I'm so ready for this. Damn, ladies! It better be hot, boys. The water's warm. Come on in. Ooh! Don't mind if I do, boys. Ooh! Okay, -she's showing tit! -What? They're not gonna hang like this forever. I have more class than that. So bougie. My parents taught me better. My parents taught me shit. Yeah, well, I think that my mom was a slut. So, Tony, what do you think about it? Hmm, you know, I think, uh... I say fuck it. Fuck it. It's Christmas. YOLO! - See? Freedom. - Oh, my God. It's kind of nice, I'm not gonna lie. I feel like we should have some more bubbles though, don't you think? No? Okay. I saw a creek in the back, maybe we can go skinny dipping next time. Oh, I like where your mind is headed. Yeah, the temperature's good. Holy shit, Tony, I don't think you're crazy after all. Guys, look at the pigs! Look! - What? - Look! Right there. I don't see anything. It was literally right there. I think both of you are losing your shit. I think you're crazy. So, Tony, how about that campfire? Yeah, man. That's a good idea. What's taking them so long? Let's just get dressed and head down to the fire. We don't need them to escort us. Yeah, we might want to hang out here for a few. Son of a bitch. Pig roast? He can sleep on the fucking couch. And what were you trying to do? Hide it from me? I'm not hiding anything from you, I just told you. Yeah, after hiding it the whole time. Nobody's hiding shit from you, girl. We're all just trying to have a good time, which seems impossible for some. You know, you've been in SoCal too long. Take that pussy off its pedestal. What the fuck does that mean, bitch? Oh, I'm the bitch? I'm sorry, let the three of us just roll out the red carpet for you and cater on your every need. I don't see how Tony does it. You are a fucking bitch and don't include my boyfriend's name - in your mouth. - Really? Is that how you're gonna be? Then go to your room, child, before I go the fuck off! Hey, girl. Let's not argue. I know you can hear me. Let's just appreciate the differences. I'm listening. I'll ask the boys not to leave any remains after dinner, but they've got a fire going, and I really wanna hang out with you. YOLO. Okay. You're right. I'm sorry for being such a prima donna. All right. Go get ready. Come on. -I'm guessing it's cold outside? -Yes, grab a coat. Well, I hope you know where you're going. I don't want to get lost in the woods. Hunter left out glow sticks. Of course he did. Adrianna, the one good thing about dating a Marine is that they always lead the way. Well, at least he's thoughtful. Tony's thoughtful, too. I wish Hunter was more thoughtful, but what are you gonna do? Oh, fuck! - God, are you okay? - Ow, no! Why does this happen to me? - Because you're a bitch. - Oh, fuck you, bitch. A long weekend. Goddamn it, Tony. What the fuck? Oh, fuck, babe, you weren't supposed to see this. I thought you were eating, not carving up flesh! My God. Sorry, don't hate me. I'm gonna come grab you when I'm all cleaned up. I love you! Adrianna! Why is she limping? I don't know how you do it, man. All right, let's just finish what we started. Oh, man, okay. I'm fucked, you know that, right? No, you're fine. Come on. She'll get over it. No one's getting laid tonight. Tony, what do you think about your first pig roast? Let him finish. I-- I didn't get to start. Uh, to be honest, it was an experience. That you'll never do again. No, I'll do it again. No, I will definitely do it again. My man, my man, my man. But-- but-- but what I wanna do differently the next time is I want to actually kill the pig. I wanna-- I wanna hunt, trap, and kill the pig. You know, get a little-- little primal situation going before otherwise I feel bad, you know? Just seeing a dead pig hanging up and all that, so... Brittany, why aren't you fucking drinking? One of us has to be the responsible one -and pace ourselves. -Since when are you that person? Party pooper! I'm glad my intoxication levels are of the utmost concern. Honestly, I'm with you, Brit. Thank you. Ah, I say we king her designated driver or something at least comparable. I second that notion, Tony. All in favor say aye. - Aye. - Aye. Any opposed? Well, I am honored. Now, baby, can you massage my shoulders? You know, I should hate the process, but that pig roast was so good. You boys did a great job. Don't hate the process, princess. Here we go. Didn't you used to eat meat? Yeah, that was before I was educated - on this topic. - Oh! Or before you were a victim of propaganda. Okay, no. Come on, guys. We were just all friendly, buddy-buddy. Let's not go there. -Let's keep it down. -My bad, my bad. -Think before you speak. -Okay, okay, okay. Damn it. Tony, you take the floor, I'm not winning this one. Okay. I got a little something to lighten the spirits and give us a little Christmas spirit... - Okay. - ...if you will. Aw! It's a little poem. I didn't write it. -I hope it rhymes. -Her and her rhymes. It's a poem, so it rhymes, -but... -I love a good rhyme. Uh, it goes a little something like this. "T'was the night before Christmas. When all through the house not a creature was stirring." - Except for a mouse. - No, not even a mouse. Honestly, I don't know the rest of that, so... Oh, come on! -I was getting into it. -I know. Well, let me get you back into it. - The suspense. - I gotta just pull it up. Okay. "Not a creature was stirring. Not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care. In hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there. The children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads." Oh, baby, you're so sweet. - Who's getting laid tonight? - Ah, come on. You wanna place a wager? Probably-- probably you, Mr. Manly Man. Oh, God. Oh, looks like you're winning the game here. Thank you for bringing us here. - I'm glad you came. Thank you. - Of course. The one good thing you did for us. Oh, is that a compliment? That was a compliment. I'll take it. If that's all I can get from you. You know, you two have been going at it since the moment we left this trip. Come on. Okay, we're cool. Right, Hunter? Let's pump it out. Huh? I'll take it. I'll take it for now. Yeah. Well, on that note, I am gonna order a pizza since you savages had your feast. -Which way is the house? -This way. This way. Go this way. No, Hunter. Babe-- Come on, Hunter! I thought we just had a thing going. You know I gotta fuck it up, come on. Do you need a lamp? Uh, I have my phone. Don't save me a piece unless there's pepperoni on it! I love to watch you leave. How romantic. Babe, save me a piece, please. Well, ladies, I'm gonna go use the restroom. Baby, why don't you just go pop a squat in the woods? I said restroom. Who said anything about a number one? - Fucking disgusting. - You asked for it. Hey, uh, bring me back a slice please. And my girlfriend. And make sure you wash your hands. And make sure you clean it up before I go. Two in the pink, one in the stink! Shocker! Behave yourselves, boys. Oh, my God, asshole! What are you trying to do? Give me a miscarriage? I know, I know. Tony, come the fuck on! Fuck! It's okay, Hunter. It's just my friend Marcus. Marcus from Hillcrest. Hi! Sorry. I'm Marcus. You gave me a fucking heart attack. You see what I'm saying, Brit? Figures you'd have a little boy toy running around with you. Yeah, I don't think he was ready -for this little escapade. -Good. You would have done the same thing, Hunter. Do not compare us. Ease up and turn down that headlamp. Are you trying to blind us? Let me ask you. Have you ever been blown by a tranny? Uh... - Come again? - You heard me. No fucking way! I brought extra because I figured you'd want. Oh, my God. Well, why didn't you say so? I've been dreaming of a white Christmas. ♪ Just like the ones I used to know ♪ I was worried the fuck out.

Oh, fuck! My man! I love you. I'm so glad you're here. What made you decide on this voyage? Was it my pitch? I need-- I need a little adventure in my life. - And why not? It's Christmas. - Great. But what about work? I told my boss I had a family emergency. Classic. But thanks for bringing blow the one time I can't do any. Sorry. I know, I had to, Brit. -I won't let you do any, girl. -Thanks. Please, no! Please! No! Please, just leave me alone! No! No! God, dude! Surprise! There's Tyler. Oh, my God! I knew it! Okay, I really need to pee or I'm gonna go in my leggings.

And that girl you heard scream? Tony. Hell of an introduction, Tyler. No, thanks. Sorry. I didn't mean to catch you with your hands full. Actually I haven't seen my cock since you scared me. Last time I checked I think it was in my ass. I'm sure you know a little something about that, don't you? What? Your asshole? Whatever, man. I suck at being a smart ass. Yeah, you do. - Ladies. - Marcus! Are we ready to get this party started? - Yas queen! - Bravo. - About time! - I mean, right? Ladies and gentlemen, bump, anybody? Do you have the proper tools?

I haven't seen the girls in a while. I'm gonna go see what's popping. What, are you scared? No. I did not come all the way here to hang out with choads all night. And who knows? Bigfoot could be the fuck out there. -Maybe. -I think he's scared, Tony. That he is. And thanks for the party favor. You got it! Because the next round is on you.
