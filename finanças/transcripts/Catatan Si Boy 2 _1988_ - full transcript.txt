Full speed, 100 kilometers per hour on the first lap. How many seconds do we have to get through it? 90 seconds. - For the second lap, how many seconds? - 60 seconds. The road is wavy. Don't worry. Just relax. Wavy you said? You think you're at sea? Are you insane? Be careful. There are crocodiles in this river. But I'm sure they're not as dangerous as you are. Maximum speed 100 kilometers per hour. The obstacles include animals crossing and an old granny passing by. - Including your grandma? - That's right. You're insane. You're always on time. I've got to give it to you. Damn. Even in this situation, I still can't forget Nuke. I wonder why. If I'm that desperate, maybe I would go to London to meet her. But if I think clearly, why should I go there? It would cost me a lot and her parents may not like me. It would be better to donate the money to the mosque. I don't want to date her if her parents oppose it. I'm concerned about Nuke. I know she was anxious and heart broken when we parted. What else can I say? I've tried to keep myself occupied, to distract me from thinking of her. But I still can't forget her. Now I don't feel like dating anyone. I'm afraid it will happen again. It won't be fun. Everything is too late now. But if I'm left with no choice, what can I do? Am I right? Attention, Garuda Indonesia Airlines, flight number UIA-801 from Los Angeles, Honolulu, Biak and Denpasar has landed. - That's Vera. - Right. She's getting prettier. -Come on, hurry -Yes. Wait. Vera, my baby daughter. You look so beautiful. Mom, this is Priska. My friend from L.A. - Good afternoon, Ma'am. - Good afternoon. - Afternoon, Sir. - Good afternoon. Pris, just come with us. The driver will take you home. No, thanks. I'll just wait here. Come with us. It's all right. - Right, Honey? - Sure. Thank you, Ma'am. But someone will come to pick me up soon. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Okay. - We're going then. Don't forget to call. - Bye. - Bye. I'm sorry I'm late. Have you been here long? I've been here for a year, it makes my hair curly. Curly? You mean like a noodle. - Hi, Priska. - Hi, Vanda. You look more beautiful now. Congratulations. Enough. Come on, let's go. You said you didn't want to come back here even during school break. You wanted to take summer courses. Now you changed your mind? I'm not sure why. But I felt bored there. And I missed you too. Are you sure you missed us? I know that you actually like it here in Jakarta. I think so, Mom. It's better to live in our own country, no matter what. I think I will study at the university here. You said you would apply to some colleges in L.A., and now you want to study here. How can you finish college then? Our one and only daughter, she demands too much. You wanted a daughter, so much so that you even dreamed about it. Now this is what happens. So you have to do as I say. Because I was the child that you wanted Right, Mom? Boy. Hi, Ugly. What is it? I want to introduce you to my cousin. She just got back from L.A. There she is. Hold on a second. Come here, Priska. I'll introduce you to Boy. Come on. This is Boy. Priska. Boy. When did you come from L.A? Yesterday. Oh my gosh. You just can't stand to see us happy. This is Andi. You're nosy. Damn you. - What a scary car. - Scary? You think it's a ghost? Boy, let's go out tonight. I'll treat you. What do you think? - By car or by foot? - Are you trying to be funny? Of course by car. Mom said I shouldn't walk far. It will make my calves swollen. Hideous. Can I come too? You're not invited. If you want to come, you have to pay for yourself. It's crowded here. - Where were you? - Just hanging out. Banana again? This is Ina, Boy's little sister. - Ina. - Priska. Ina, Emon is going to treat us tonight. You can bring Aldi. - Where are we going? - You'll find out. Since Boy and Nuke broke up, I feel bad seeing him so sad. Seems like he lost his will to live. So you're trying to be the matchmaker for Boy and Priska? That's a secret. If they like each other, I think it's fine. You're cool, Boy. And you're beautiful too. I'm not beautiful. You're just trying to be nice. I mean it. Why should I say you're beautiful if you're not? This afternoon you looked like a tomboy. But tonight you look so exquisite. You lied, didn't you? Why do you say I lied? Seriously, I didn't lie. - Emon told me so much about you. - What did he say? He said you're nice. Come forward a bit. - Do you want another drink? - No, thanks. - Hi, Boy. - Hi, Cha. Who are you here with? - Who are you here with? - This is Priska. Priska, this is my friend from college. -Priska -Ocha. Boy, I'll go to lady's room now. - Okay. - Bye, Priska. Who is she? Why did she look at me like that? Because you're more beautiful than she is. Typical girl. She can't stand to see a more beautiful girl. You're such a sweet talker. How was last night? I saw you were very intimate with Boy. He's all right. You can't find anyone like him in L.A. He's a display item. You think he's good merchandise? You're mean. How could you say he's a display item? He doesn't have a girlfriend? If he did, what's the point of me introducing you to him? Why would I involve my own cousin? No, I wouldn't. - Then let him take me to Bandung. - That's what you want. But that's a good idea. Just tell mom and dad I have an exam. Control your dog! Didn't you send it to dog school? Excuse me. My dog doesn't like mutt dogs like yours. Watch what you're saying. Watch what you're saying. Wimp! Maybe your dog is a wimp too. - Come on, stop it. This is embarrassing. - Let me be! I need to teach him a lesson! - Fatso! - Teach me a lesson? Are you a private course teacher? - I can smash you! - Try it then, if you dare. - If I meet you again, I will blow you up! - You think I'm a balloon? What? You annoying fat man! - What major do you take in L.A? - Management. Why management? Most Indonesian students, when they study abroad, take a hair stylist major or fashion design. Some even just have fun and play around, spending their parents' money. Not exactly. Some of them are successful. Depends on the individuals. Why didn't you study in L.A? You can afford it. It's not about money. Trying to promote yourself? - You must have a boyfriend there. - I've never had a boyfriend. - Liar! I don't believe it. - I haven't found the right man. Men are not like clothing. What about you? How many million girlfriends? About one million. But all of them are history now. Crazy. That many? You're crazy. How many million girlfriends do I have, you said. - Wait here for a minute. - All right. - Priska. - Mom. You look slimmer. Honey, Priska is here. I missed you. - When did you arrive from L.A? - A few days ago. Mom, Emon couldn't bring me here. So Boy came with me instead. - Peace be upon you. - And unto you peace. Boy. Boy. This is my dad, Emon's uncle. - Sorry for troubling you. - Please come in. Come on, Boy. - Give me some. - You want this? -Hi, Win -Hi, Fat. That's your girlfriend. Hi, boys. Come and take a look at us. - How cocky. - What are those? Teeth or corn? What prominent teeth. Oh, no. He's coming over here. - Let's get out of here. - Let's go. Come on. Just forget it. You're mischievous. Why did you say that about his teeth? I heard that Alwin is hitting on Ina, Boy's sister. So what? That's not our problem. - Do you want him to hit on you? - What? No thanks. Ca, that's Vera. That American chick is here again. And she's getting more beautiful. Ocha won't be pleased. Maybe you have lesbian tendencies. That's why you said she's beautiful. You're jealous, aren't you? Do you think you have the guts to slap her again this time? You're a trouble maker. You know what? Boy has a new girl now. I've met her. So why should I make a fuss and get upset? Moron. I notice you keep daydreaming. What's wrong? Thinking about Priska? I don't know. I'm confused now. Priska is beautiful. But I have to know more about her, before engaging in relationship with her. What are you waiting for? Do it, before someone else does. I think she's pretty nice. I'm afraid it will be like with Nuke. I loved her but her parents opposed us. You have to take a risk. You were just unlucky with Nuke. I'm not sure. Vera? Vera. When did you come back? Why didn't you tell me you were here? You look more beautiful now. Vera. Vera. Boy, please do me a favor. Alwin came to see me. He's in the living room now. I don't want to see him. He's a hoodlum. Why are you afraid? Maybe he just wants to talk. I'm reluctant to see him. Please go and see him. Just tell him I'm sleeping. But I have to go. It's Saturday night. Aldi will be here any minute. What should I do? That's why you shouldn't smile at just anyone. Boy, please help me. You kissed me? That old trick. - All right then. Wait here. - Thanks, Boy. - Get the snacks. - Yes, Ma'am. - Please have a drink. - Thank you. Mom, Dad, please stay with Alwin. I have to go now. - Where's Ina? - Too many sleeping pills. She's still sleeping. - Boy! - Peace be upon you. And unto you peace. - How are you? Good? - I'm fine. - Thank you. - I haven't seen you in a long time. Where have you been? - Do you want something to drink? - Anything is fine. Mira! - Did you come alone? - Yes. Everyone here has to be able to speak English. Including the maid. - How are your parents? - They're fine. Wait a second. I'll go and get Vera. You've changed. You're more beautiful. We didn't meet for almost a year. You remember Gombloh? We went to his concert. He died. Also the bass player. I heard about it. Where did you hear it from? I'm sure you heard on the radio. Cool. Nuke's gone and now Vera is back. What did I tell you? Fortunately, I haven't fallen for Priska yet. If I asked Priska to be my girl, I'd be doomed. If I date two women at once, it's a sin. I'll have a date with Vera tomorrow. Cha, look. Boy and that American girl. They're back together again. But didn't you say Boy had a new girlfriend? You're unlucky. You're defeated again. Vera beats you again. Why don't you go and ask shaman to give you an amulet to captivate Boy. What do you mean captivate? Shut up you two! You want me to pull down your pants again? - What are you doing? - Where do you think you're going? Are you nuts? I'm not wearing panties! Boy, I try to forget all the bad memories from the past. Because for me, life is about the future. - Really? - Yes. Because I realize now that we can't always get what we want. I thought so. There will be times when you succeed and when you fail. Yes. Life changes in unexpected ways. - Right, Boy? - Yeah. Do you think I've changed? I told you, you're more beautiful, more mature. What's your plan after you graduate? I don't know. I think I want to start my own business I don't want to depend on my parents. What about your plans to marry? About 300 years from now. You'll become a mummy by then. Boy? Can I be honest with you? It turns out, I can't lie to myself. I've tried to forget you. I've tried to erase all the memories of you from my mind. But I can't. I still care about you. Kissing? Boy! Boy! Boy, Vera. When did you get here? You were having fun? Sorry to interrupt. You meet again, widow and widower. - What is it, Emon? - I have a message from Kendi. Come here. I want to tell you something. Excuse me, Vera Wait here. - How did you know I was here? - I went to your house first. Ina told me you were here. Priska wants to talk to you. Silly you. You just can't see me happy, can you? You could have left the message with anyone at home. Sorry, Boy. I didn't know you were with her. Go home now. I'll be there soon. Tell Kendi I'll go to his place. Vera, I'm going now. Bye. Bye. What's going on? It seems serious. It's about the car. Andi has some problems that he wants to discuss with me. Boy, I called you several times. But you weren't home. So I came to Jakarta to see you. Well, I'm a boy. I like to hang out. Why should I stay at home? What if I lay an egg then? You're funny. I heard from Emon you will be in a rally car competition next week. Can I come and watch? Sure. Why not? What time will it start? Probably 09:00. It's scheduled to start at 8:00. As always, it'll be late. I will call my dad and tell him I'm staying a few days in Jakarta. What's wrong? You seem rattled. I don't know. It just happened. Maybe because my cat is missing. How is it with Boy? You look happy. But I don't believe in him anymore. Remember how bad he treated you last time. I don't appreciate it. He's different now. He's serious now. He's nice. If she's sure about him, just let them be. But I don't want anymore trouble. I don't want to worry. It's up to you. - What do you think, Dad? - If you're happy, I'm happy. Okay, Boy. Damn you. You almost gave me a heart attack. Sorry, Man. How is it, Boy? Is it good? It's not bad, let's hope it won't crash. - If it crashes, just kick it. - Very funny. - I want to try it. - Okay, I'll bring it to the back. Wait. I'll leave the car here. Bring it to my place the day after tomorrow. - Okay. - Let's go, Andi. Are you and Vera back together? Because she's getting more beautiful. I think I'll fall in love again. What about Priska? You're a player. That's what bothers me now. Emon told her to stay close to me. She keeps asking me to take her everywhere. I can't say no. I have no choice. I hope Vera won't know about it. She will think I'm a player. You're too kind to everyone. I don't know. We'll just wait and see. Hey, that's a cool guy. Look at that dapper looking guy. - You're cute. Hi, Man. What's up? - The other one is cute too. Sorry, we're having our period now. - Have you paid the car tax? - Of course, honey. Why did you put ice in it? Mommy said I can't drink cold things. What if I get a hemorrhoid? Have surgery to remove it. You don't want to keep it, do you? Keep it? You think it's a cat? Just get me some warm water. Drinking something cold just this once won't kill you. I don't want to go back inside. Okay, I'll take the chance. Nasty. It's cold, but you finished it anyway. Because I'm thirsty. Ina, I'm so very confused. I feel like smashing my head. Do you have an axe? - An axe? - Yes. I'm confused. Boy is getting back together with Vera. I don't understand it either. My brother is unique. Now I feel pity for Priska. She's my cousin. If she knows Boy is with Vera now, maybe she will drink poison, in orange flavor. What will happen then? She would die probably. Have you told Priska about Vera? Not yet. But I don't like Vera. She's arrogant. She's too overseas minded. Everything has to be branded. And she keeps bragging about L.A. My goodness. I can't stand it. Actually, I want Boy to be with Priska. Isn't that a good idea? I don't know. You should agree with me. May I speak to Vera? - Who is this? - Priska, her friend. Please wait. - Hi, Pris. - Hi. - Where are you now? - Jakarta. - How are you? - I'm fine. - Where have you been? - Just hanging around. Keep myself busy. When will you go back to L.A? I think I still like it here. Maybe I will move here permanently. - Really? - Yes. What about you? When will you go back to L.A? I want to study here again. When will you come to my house? - Someday I will. - Promise? Sure. See you later. My regards to your dad and mom. - Okay, bye. - Okay, bye. - The rally is on Sunday? - Yes, Dad. I just want you to be careful. - Remember your mom. - Yes, Dad. -Get the water -Yes, Ma'am. - Peace be upon you. - And unto you peace. #Missing subtitle Friday prayer was short. Looks good. You're no longer a kid, remember? - Boy. - What's wrong with you? Mom, where's my diabetes medicine? I forgot. What a coincidence. I'm starving. - You don't kiss my hand. - Many others kissed you already. - What do you mean? - Ina. Now please get your dad's medicine. Why me? I just got home, Mom. Tell him to do it. Ina, do it. What's with the frowny face? My ass. Boy, she is your sister. Stop teasing her. Let's eat, Honey. - Is the Sambal good? - Yes. Peace be upon you. Hello. - Boy? - Who's this? It's me. Ocha. Hi, Cha. What's up? Boy, can you pick us up? You said you wanted to treat us. - Treat you? - Yes. Dian, Dewi and Ita are waiting for you. They said you promised to treat them. Maybe you're drunk. I never promise it. - Sorry, but I'm busy now. - Busy with what? You have too many girlfriends, that's why you forgot us. That's wrong. You are wrong. You have Priska, but you're still going out with Vera. I can't come today. Really. Just this once please. Then we won't tell anyone about it. - What are you doing? - What is it? Earthquake? Hey, you! You've been in there too long already! Can't you see I'm waiting here? You want to show off because you're big? I could poke you with a needle and your body would sink. Who are you calling fat? You're the fat one! - Enough, Dewi. Just ignore her. - It's a disgrace to fight with you. It's embarrassing. - You should just twist her arms. - We can help you. That's enough. Let's get out of here. Me first. - Good morning, Boy. - What are you doing here? Boy, I'm so sorry. My grandma is very ill. I have to take my mom there. I can't be your navigator for the rally. I have to go this afternoon. Oh, no. But who will replace you now? That's why I've brought him here. I'm sure he can do it. You were in some rally contests, right? - Yes. It was a bicycle contest. - Oh, no. Bicycle? I'm ruined. Even if it was a bicycle or becak, it was still a rally contest. You're just jealous. You're willing to replace me as his navigator, right? If you do, I will take care of the matter with the committee. I can. But, does he agree? If he doesn't, that's fine. But just watch out. - Flirty. - What? - Sissy. - How dare you! - Boy. - What is it? - Phone call for you. - From who? From Vera. I'm confused now. I have a rally contest tomorrow. Andy has to go to Surabaya. I have no choice but let Emon fill in for him. Why Emon? You can ask someone else. What if something happens to you? That's why I have to do some practice with Emon tonight. We have to cancel our date tonight, okay? Hello. Who's this? Hi, Emon. Where are you? Boy, it's me, Priska. Not Emon. Yes, I know. Why? Boy, what's wrong with you? Nothing. Just having some fun. Okay, see you tonight. Who was that? Emon. He's telling his father he will join me in the car race. It was Emon? But you talked so sweet. We have to talk sweet to a guy like him. Priska. Let's eat. What's wrong? Nothing. I want to join Boy in a car rally. Emon, you are our only son. What if something happens to you? You think a car rally is as easy as a bicycle race? Boy wouldn't dust off the car. It's probably only 260 kilometers per hour. Oh, my God! Are you a ghost's child or something? You say 260 kilometers per hour isn't a dust off? You could be blown away. Blown away? You think I'm a missile? What your dad said is right. You shouldn't joke about it. But dad started it. He said the car could fly. Let him do it, Dad. It will evoke his masculine side. How dare you! It's up to you then. Don't blame me if anything happens. This morning, we're about to witness the biggest rally competition in 1988. The best racers are participating. Contestant number one is Azan as the driver, and Budi, with their Honda car. What's your last message for your family at home? What do you mean? Stop teasing me. - We don't know what will happen, do we? - Stop it, will you? You will attract bad luck. The time is almost 8:00 o'clock, the event is ready to start Attention please, the contestants for Honda Prambors Rally, please get ready in your cars. The rally will start soon. There are 20 contestants participating, and the distance to be covered is 800 kilometers, and will be reached within 7 hours. Good luck, Boy. Ladies and gentlemen, you are expected not to disturb the participants, and stay away from the cars. Be careful. Contestant number one, please be ready on the starting line, we will start the rally. We ask Mr. Edwin, as the chairman of Honda Rally Prambors 88, to release contestant number one. Here, take this. - What's that? - Just take this. It's good for your stamina. Ladies and gentlemen, please give a round of applause for contestant number one to start the event. To Mr. Edwin, who's willing to spend his time... Sorry I'm late. Bad traffic. Good luck. Be careful. I'll be waiting for you. Good luck, Emon. Contestant number two, get ready. From the Honda team, Boy and Emon, take your position. Mr. Widoho, the chairman of the Development Foundation, will release the contestant. - Are you Emon's cousin? - Yes. Why didn't you tell me? Emon and I are very close. Let's hope Emon and Boy will make it safely. Oh, no! Boy! I'm scared. - Where's the next turn? - In about 200 meters. Keep going! When will we reach the third post? In about 500 meters. Hit the brake! - Hurry please! - Okay. Please hurry, Sir. Boy! Boy! - Why are so slow? - You are mean. You want to leave me here? Boy, please. My tummy. Look out, Boy! Buffalo's swimming pool! Duck! Praise be to Allah. May my tummy still be intact at the finish line. I don't understand myself, why I fell in love with him again. Really? You broke up before? Yes, and then I went to L.A. Boy loves you too? I think so. - Which way should we go? - I don't know either. Left or right? Wait. Turn left! I told you it would crash! - Are you sure this is the right way? - I think I got it wrong. Please forgive me, Boy. Goat! Help! Aunty! Uncle! Help! Boy! Boy! Go away! We lost too much time. I have no choice but to go even faster. Go faster, that's fine. But remember, I'm not married yet. God, please forgive me for I have sinned... Boy, I don't want to do it a second time. No way. I've had it. I could go crazy in here! Help... Boy, don't let it reach the highest speed. It's all Kendi's fault. Why should his grandma get sick at a time like this? - Boy, I have to go to the bathroom. - It has to wait. I can't hold it anymore. You're mean. - Is it still far? - Relax. We'll reach the finish line soon. In a moment, we'll know the winner of this competition. For the audience, please stay clear out of the race track. The winner of this race is the car in the number two starting position. Boy and Emon. Everyone, let's welcome them. People at the back, don't get too close. Flower girls, ready? Mr. Boy, Mr. Emon, please come forward. - How is my machine, Emon? - Your machine is good. Ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause for the champions! - Congratulations Boy. - Congratulations Boy. - Kiss me. - I don't wanna kiss you. Congratulations Boy. I'm sorry. I didn't know you and Vera were in a relationship. Since we first met, I got the feeling you didn't like me. You didn't respond to me. I still like you. I apologize for not telling you about Vera. It will be hard for me to forget you. I don't know why. Do you still want to stay in Jakarta? I'm disappointed in Jakarta. And I'm disappointed in you. I will go home to Bandung tomorrow. Maybe I'll go back to L.A. next month. I want you to understand my feelings. I didn't want to deceive you. Let's go home. Vera! Vera! Open the door. Listen to me first. Sorry, Priska. I have to talk to Vera. Emon, come to my house tomorrow. Vera! Pull over please. Vera! Vera! Open it. I have to explain something to you. Open it. Don't misunderstand me. Open! Oh, my god. Vera. Excuse me, Honey. What's happened now? What's wrong? Did you fight with Boy? Men are unreliable. He even went out with my friend. This is what happens when you trust a man. Which friend of yours did he go out with this time? Priska. My friend from L.A. I caught them just getting back after a date. I hate him. Hello, good evening. This is Priska. May I speak to Vera? It's Priska. I hate you, Priska! - Why? - She doesn't want to talk. That's good. Just let her be mad. Let Boy and Vera quarrel. No. Boy is a nice guy. I have to talk to Vera. Emon, dad wants to talk to you. Dad... I'm baffled now. I went out with Priska last night, to explain to her about Vera and I. When I took her to Emon's house, Vera was there already. She was furious. Who would've thought Vera and Priska were good friends in L.A. What I'm worried about is Vera has misunderstood me. She might think I hit on Priska too. - Did you met Vera after that? - I called her several times. - She didn't want to talk. - You didn't go to her house? I will feel bad if I meet her mom. I would feel ashamed. If you were right, why should you feel bad? You have to go and see Vera. Explain everything to her. It's not easy. She's such a hot tempered girl. She would be outraged. She wouldn't trust me anymore. - Boy. - Hi, Kendi. - Is your grandma better already? - Yes. She's been skateboarding already. - How long have you been crazy? - Just a minute ago. You did great, I said you could win the car race. Damn! It wasn't me who drove the car. It was him. Boy. Yeah. But you navigated him. - Ina, please get us some drinks. - You just can't stand to see me happy. And you, if you give me a cold drink again this time, I'll kill you! - I'll give you a huge block of ice. - Funny. Go. What did Vera say to you last night? Vera wanted to take Priska and you out to the club last night. I told her, Priska went out with Boy already. You didn't tell her that Priska and I are just friends? No. She didn't ask me. Why should I explain it to her? Boy, I have an idea. Tell Emon to go to Vera's house. Tell him to explain everything. What did you say? Why don't you go and tell her? You tell me to go there? You know she's feisty. She'd snap at me. I won't go! I agree. Go to Vera's house right now. You're Priska's cousin anyway. Tell Vera that I love her. - Priska and I are just friends. - Good luck. Happy now, huh? Kendi! See? I told you. Vera was mad at me. She said, "Why should he send you here?" "If he thinks he's right, tell him to come here!" "Tell Boy to stop his sweet talk." It drove me nuts. She has a tiger living inside her. It's all your fault. You told her Priska and I are friends? I did. I even told her that you care for and love... only her. What did she say then? What? I'll be damned! That's what she said. I suggest you to talk to her in person. - Where's Priska now? - Went back to Bandung already. My heart breaks to see Priska. She called Vera many times, but Vera still doesn't want to talk. - It's your fault too. - You blame me again? - You want me to twist your arms? - But you caused this. Hello. - Boy, come here quick! - What's up? Alwin and his friends are ganging up on Aldi. - Where are you now? - Pasar Kaget Blok M. Hurry, come quickly. - I'm on my way. - Andi, come with me. Aldi's in trouble. What's wrong? I'm coming with you. You stay here. - No. I'm coming with you. - Hurry then. In the name of Allah, the most gracious and merciful. Come on, Andy. In the name of Allah the most gracious and merciful. Look at your teeth. If you disturb my sister and her boyfriend again, you'll deal with me. I apologize. I promise I won't disturb your sister anymore. Now leave this place. Don't forget. Get your teeth fixed. Emon, Kendi, let's go back. I apologize about that night. I wanted to see you since yesterday. But you didn't pick up my calls. I wanted to come here. But I feel bad with your mom. Since Emon talked to you in the ranch, I know something was wrong. I knew he was talking about his cousin. And when you picked up the call in the car, you were nervous. You said it was Emon on the phone. You remembered in the car rally? Priska looked shocked when I said I loved you. I can't lie about my feelings. I just want you to be honest about Priska. She's my best friend. I don't want to lose her just because you like her. I swear we're only friends. Emon wanted us to be close, but we're merely friends, no more. You went out with her for three hours without telling me! - Is that your friendship with her? - I ask you not to raise your voice. Who cares! Even if I want to yell, it's my right! This is my house! I'm telling you the truth. I swear to God we're only friends. If you don't believe me, fine. You never change. All right audience, that was a performance by Ayu Laksmi, with her song "Halo Sobat" written by Hari Sabar. - Hi, Boy. - Hi. - You're alone? - I'm alone now. - Where's Vera? - Cranky, as usual. What a coincidence. You have to take me home tonight. I'm sorry, but I want to be alone now. I need some peace. I apologize for being rude. I don't want to lose you to someone else. I love you. I can't forget you. I mean it. No other man understands me like you do. Forgive me, Dear. I came to your house just to explain things. Emon told me Vera didn't want to see you. I called her many times too. I even went to her house. But she still didn't want to see me. You have to talk to her. Only you can understand her. I will try. Even though it hurts me to see you with her. What is it this time? Why do you keep pacing back and forth? I know you're feeling anxious. - Hello, Vera. - Who is this? It's Ocha. Hi, Cha. What's up? I see that you're getting back together with Boy. You just heard that? What if that's right anyway? I consider you a friend. That's why I'm going to tell you this. What are you trying to say actually? About Boy, your boyfriend. He just played with your feelings. Before he met up with you again, I saw him with another woman, many times. It's all right. I'm sure it's his friend. I trust him. I know for a fact that they're not just friends. I saw it for myself, how close they were. Very intimate. From what I heard, that woman is his new girlfriend. - Her name... - Just tell her that girl's name. - Right? - That's right. If I'm not mistaken, her name is Priska. She's good looking too. Priska, Emon's cousin. - Vera. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Come in. - No, thanks. I'm in a hurry. I want to see Boy. Boy? He went to Bandung. You didn't know that? Becoming a good and honest person is as hard as being a cheater. Depends on who that person is, and who's judging. For me, you're the nicest man I've ever met. Vera. I just wanted to prove it myself, whether or not you're honest. - Sorry, Vera. I'm just... - And you're no better than him. - Vera. - Boy, wait. Hold on a second. I'll pick you up later. Wait here. Vera. Stop! Wait! Stop, Vera. We need to talk, Vera. You don't understand. I don't trust you anymore! All right but give me a chance to talk! We're not a match. I hate you! Don't be childish. Stop the car first. - You disappoint me. - We need to talk. I love you. Boy never liked me, let alone love me. Boy came to Bandung, asking me to explain the problem to you. I admire his honesty. He is the nicest man I've ever known. He loves you. I apologize for our misunderstanding. It's not your fault. I'm the one who has to apologize for not being honest with you. I like Boy. He's a faithful man. He doesn't want to disappoint you by loving another woman. Boy is waiting for you at home. Vera. Please forgive me. So nosy. Oh my God, Boy. It's like a porno. Well audience. This is it, the useless scene.
