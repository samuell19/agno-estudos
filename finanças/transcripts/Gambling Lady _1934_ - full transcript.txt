Oh Mr. Fallon is in conference, I'm sorry. Is this the directors' meeting or a bathroom conference? Gentlemen, you'll be glad to know that the syndicate's earnings for the last quarter... topped the previous quarter by 150,000 bucks on a flat investment of 300 grand. Our total net income for the quarter ending march 31 was exactly 451,000 berries... divided as follows, slot machines 32,000, Racetrack pools and bookmaking 107,000... poker games, New York, Philadelphia, Washington 86,000; Fantan games 77,000, Chinese lottery 31,000; Roulette 99,000, Crap games 19,000. Things are looking up for the next quarter. Just got a flag. Just as I predicted, we're starting off with a bang. Taluca maiden won the Grand Nationale today. - We played our money 7 to 1. - That's bringing them home. And I don't mind telling you that I planted Charlie Lang... at a well known local track to make connections. Now, that's all boys, you can scram. - Hello Mr. Fallon. - Oh, Hi kid. - Can I see you a minute? - What's on your mind? I get a couple of things I want to show you. No, we can't use any of that old equipment of yours kid. But these are new improvements, watch. What's that? The mirror gag? Yeah, I can see every card I deal off the top. On a bulb, see? - Pressure. - Yeah, it's Ok. Wait you see this one. Pull the string... - What's that? A hold-out? - Yeah, runs right up the leg. You can even walk with it. Yeah, it's Ok kid. Say, you haven't got a bowl of goldfish on you? You're kidding me. Well, they're all right kid. You can send around two of each. All right, thanks Mr. Fallon. All right, get me a list of those dead accounts. Sharky, the boss wants our list of dead accounts, hurry up. Ok. Here you are Mr. Fallon. I thought I told you to close out Mike Lee. Well, he's made a lot of money for the syndicate Mr. Fallon. Yeah, he's into us for 1,200, and it's time he paid up. You know we ain't running no community chest. You know, what he needs is a crooked dealer to get him going again. I already talked to Mike, and he ain't having any. Listen... if a dealer throws him the cards, all he has to do is play them. He couldn't call that crooked, could he? Get him on the phone. Hello? Yeah, this is Mike. Oh, hold it a minute. Hello Fallon. What is he want? Yeah. No, I... I can't do it Jim. I get you. What's the verdict? Jim is down to his last million and he's getting worried. - Pay off or get out, is that it? - Yeah, something like that. Sounds like he was trying to put a sharp in the game this afternoon. Was he? Weren't you going to the track today Lady? Say, you're not falling for that stuff, are you Mike? Oh, maybe. If that's a joke, I didn't get a snicker. I've been playing cards all my life just for the kick of the game. Maybe I ought to get wise to myself, team up with a shuffle artist and... make some money. You've made plenty in your day, and you made it on the level. You played the best people in town and why? Because you're honest. Ah gee Mike... Your rep is your stock in trade. Honey, we can't buy groceries with my rep. You know, I'm just beginning to realize that honesty is a luxury and we can't afford it. Look at the way we're living. 6 months back in the rent. You know, you didn't help yourself much when you picked me for a father. Am I squawking? I should've slapped you in a good school, raised you like a real gal. Instead of dragging you all over the map with a bunch of cheap crooks. Yeah? Well, we're living the way I like it. Only... Scares me when you talk like that Mike. There's only one way to play the game... you told me so yourself and that's to play it straight. One hand at a time and let the cards fall. Gee... You wouldn't walk out on me now, would you Mike? No, I guess not. How you like to stick around and take a hand in the game? Well I, I was going to hunt up Charlie Lang. He owes me 50 bucks. Well, beat it. I got a hunch that we're going on a bust tonight. Say, I feel kind of lucky myself, so long. - See you later Mike. - So long dear. Looks like the suckers are down on a stiff, Pipe, here comes a beef. That was a swell tip you gave me Lang. Was my fault if the horse was left at the post? Did I tie him there? I wouldn't be surprised, I didn't like the way the race was run anyhow. Don't take it out on me, I didn't ride him. White stockings 10, 4, and 2. - Here's the prices on the third Charlie. - Right. - What have you got on Christmas Eve? - Not a thing, what are you doing? - Fresh. - Think that's bad, eh? - Still fighting them off Charlie? - Hello Lady. Would I love a chance to say no to you and would I be lying. - How you make out down south? - Oh, I cleaned up in old Mexico. I took their whips and their pants and their sashes. - By the way, here's 100 bucks I owe you. - It was only 50. All right, I'm a sucker, take it, forget about it. - No, I kind of feel like plunging today. - Yeah? Go to Sonny Jim, it's in the bag. - I like White Stocking. - Leave it lie, it's a dud. 100 on the nose, White Stocking. Ok, it's your 100. 100 bucks, White Stocking on the nostrils. White Stocking, go. Come on White Stocking, come on. Come on White Stocking, come on. There you are Lady, 1,100. - Sorry I stuck you for it kid. - It's funny, I'm glad. Bring that roll back tomorrow, the syndicate is going in for a real killing. I'm surprised that you tying in with that stuff. You know the syndicate can double cross you the same as any other sucker. Listen Lady, don't you worry about the syndicate crossing me up. - Well, coming over tonight? - Sure, want to see Mike. - Ok, see you later. - So long. - Hit the prices on the fourth Charlie. - Eh? Oh, yeah. Hey Mike, I picked a winner. Hey Mike, a 10 to 1 shot. Boy, are we going to town. Mike, Mike... Oh, Mike. Oh, Mike. Why didn't you play the hand out? When one can say that this man, during his lifetime, never harmed a single living thing. There is no finer tribute that I can pay to the memory of Michael Lee. Let us pray. Hey Spike. Got you down for 50 fish, come on give. - I'd like to contribute to this, I think. - You're on Peter. The last of his kind, eh? An honest gambler. - There's 100 for you. - And here's the payoff, he died broken. Oh Jim, got you down for a pair of centuries. - Sure, you can put me down- - Oh no, we're paying off in cash today. Come on, he was an alright guy, on the line. Give him 50 for me, will you Jim? Thanks. - Hello Charlie. - Hi you Lady. Well, I just closed the book with a kick in from fallon. You shouldn't have nicked him. I'm no charity case. Now will you stop? The boys all wanted to chip in. Little surprise for you. I had that made out of Mike's watch chain. Got a safety catch on it, you never can lose it. Gee, thanks. - You've been a lot of help Charlie. - Yeah? Well, I'm glad. But it ain't going to stop there either. Look, I, I don't know just how to say this to you, but... Well, now that Mike is gone... I was wondering how you'd feel about marrying me. That's a swell idea, except that... Well, it just can't be. You see... A guy would've to be on the up and up all the way with me. God, that's a lot of barn dust. Wouldn't make any difference what a guy was if you really loved him. You'd stick to the payoff, that's the kind of a dame you are. No. What you really trying to say is... I'm the wrong guy, isn't that it? I guess I'm a dope Charlie. Oh, will you quit taking it to heart? I'm only trying to help you out. We'll always be pals, won't we Lady? Hey, what other ready cash you got on hand? Cute of him, wasn't it? I'm getting kind of fed up with those cracks about Mike being in the red. Here, we're even. Oh, there's no hurry about this. - Unless it's convenient. - I'd like a receipt. I've got a proposition to make, Jim. - I'd like a job. - Doing what? Playing for the syndicate. Gee, that's swell looking tonsils. Yeah, what would you do if the boys started cold decking you? Milking the deal and playing a little game of holdouts with you? Shuffle and cut them. Need a 9 to fill an inside straight, don't you Jim? Yeah. I can stack them, cold deck them, palm them... anything you want, and I don't need glasses to read them. Hey, what is this, a sliced deck? Look them over in your spare time, I don't use them. I play my hunches. With a routine like this, you take a chance on luck? You an awful sucker Jim. You see, my angle on it is that... well, everything you do is a gamble. If you're lucky you win and if you're not... there's no amount of stacking going to help you out. - No? - No. Sooner or later it'll catch up to you. - I'll cut you for that job. - Say, wait a minute. I think I've got a spot in mind where I can use you Lady. There a couple of legitimate businessmen who think they know how to play poker. They like to buck the syndicate every now and then. They're a little cracked like you are Lady, you know, about playing it straight. I'll tell you what you do. You be at the Maryland hotel tonight at 8:30, you know the spot. Dopey Graves will be there, and a game will be going on. And pick up 10 grand from the cashier on your way out. And don't forget you're working on 10 percent of the winnings. Ok Jim, thanks. Oh, just a minute, I'll take that receipt. Thanks, so long. - Well, I guess I'm in the right pew. - Hello Lady, you're right on time. There's a new game just starting. Gentlemen, this is Lady Lee. - How do you do? - Mr. Peter Madison. - Charmed. - How do you do Mr. Madison? - Are you going to watch us play? - Am I? Like a hawk. Let me have a stack Dopey. Any limit? - Would 10 dollars be too much? - Oh, let's make it a little faster. Say, 100 dollars. Make it 500 if you like. It's Ok with me if it's all right with you gentlemen. - Fine. - Ok with me. All right, let's go. First ace deals. - I've never seen such luck in my life. - Luck and good judgment. Come on boys, there's another hand coming up, bet them like you had them. Well, if I'm to bet them like I have them, I must have a new stack of chips. Must have a horseshoe in your pocket. You're too lucky for me Lady, think I'll check out. - Mind if I sit in? - No, not at all. Didn't... - Didn't I see you in Havana last year? - Havana? No, I wasn't in Havana last year. That's funny, you know, an odd thing happened... - Dopey? - Yes Lady? Cash me in, will you? Do you wish another stack Mr. Madison? No thank you, I'm through for tonight. - So long gentlemen. - Wait a minute Lady. What are you quitting for Lady? Dopey is got you down for an 11 grand winner. That's why I'm quitting. Say, Lou is got a new sucker in the game, why don't you stay and take him? No thanks, I've had enough for one evening. Ok Lady, thanks for the profit. Pardon me, miss... - Did I understand your name was Lee? - Yes. Related to Michael Lee? Yes, he... - He was my father. - I thought so. When you got up from that table... well, that's just about the way Mike would've handled it. - Thank you Mr. Madison. - Feel like a bowl of soup? I've got enough left for that. What about a coffee shop? - With you? I'd love to. - Good. And she makes it honest too, I can't get over that. Well, she'd pay better dividends with a little more help. No, Lady doesn't need any help. She's doing Ok. I got her playing Park Avenue. - What have you got Lady? - 10 high straight. - That it's for me. - Me too. - You're certainly taking them. - You're a lucky girl. Will you please get me a drink? Come on boys, another deal, bet them like you had them. I never sat in a poker game with a woman in my life. Don't you worry about Lady, she can handle herself. - Everything ready? - All ready and playing sir. Say, since when did the romantic Stevie start to play cards? It's a gag, he's building her up for Bermuda. Bermuda? In this heat? That's a terrible place for that sort of thing. - Say, where he meet her? - Through me. I was throwing a party one night, so I telephoned the Fallon syndicate for a dealer. - And this poker queen turned up. - Oh, welcome victims. - Lady, you know Don. - Hello Lady, this Garry. Bermuda, eh? Well, I'll have to look into this. - How about a drink Stevie? - Why sure, count me out please. You know, I want to warn you about Bermuda, terribly erratic fellow this Steven. But if you want to travel, why don't you go to Norway? - 6 months of twilight. - Touting for a steamship company? So that's the kind you are. I offer you adventure and you stop me with questions. - Here's your drink Garry. - Oh, thanks. - Hope it gives you lockjaw. - Well, that's sweet of you. - Highball Lady? - No. - I raise. - See you. - Like to dance? - No. Theater? - No. - No. Two, please. - Say, do you play poker every night? - No, some nights I play blackjack. I bet. I'd like to play hearts with you sometime. - I kind of figured that. - I call. - 3 nines. - Oh, beats me. For the love of Mike Lady, do you always win? - Hey porter, call us a cab. - Not us. - Get me a cab please. - Yes ma'am. Crushed again. I only wanted to buy you a cup of coffee, that is, if you'd pay the check. No thanks. You mean I cleaned you? You need some dough? Worse than that. I need some encouragement. You won't eat, you don't dance, and you won't go to Norway. Outside of that, I'm a terrific success. Oh, it isn't that Garry, you're a swell guy. It's just that I'm in a different racket, if I wasn't I'd... Go on. Here's your taxi miss. - Goodbye kid. - Oh no. Say Jim, I've been looking over the books. Park avenue is Ok, but it don't pay dividends, Lady is taken a nose dive. - How much is she back? - She's into us for 7,500 bucks. What? It's about time we tried to get some of it back. She's lucky just like all the dopes, I told her she couldn't count on luck. It's a 50-50 break. Now wait a minute, she's a clever girl. We can't afford to lose her. Want to give a little help. Team her up with a guy that knows how to deal them. No, Lady never stand for any crooked stuff and you know it. We could tell her that the mug was a bodyguard. Now, there's an idea. Thank you very much. Point see the Duke. Private elevator at the end. Too bad that gun ain't a horse, you could hitch it in the lobby. I can take care of myself, I don't need a bodyguard. You can't in here Lady. Remember, the Duke is an opposition gang, plenty of tough eggs upstairs. It sounds like a swell party. - Remember, don't go plugging anybody. - Me? Why, I wouldn't hurt a fly. - Well, Lady. - Hello Duke. What are you doing up here? Going to give the opposition a play? Oh, you know, Fallon got big hearted and told me to give you a break. What do you got? All right, take them. - You're a big winner Lady. - Well, it's about time. Let me see that deck, will you? Look them over. Watson, my magnifying glass and a bottle of milk for tootles. Thanks. Listen, I don't play in any game unless it's on the up and up. Well, I guess that makes it my deal Sonny boy. - Where can I locate the Duke? - You got a card? Ok, private elevator at the end. - Are they with you? - Sure we are, let's go. It's all right kid, come on. Ah, excuse me gentlemen, not that I want to pry but... Oh, we just want a little game. - Joe here lost his card. - Oh, I see, I'm sorry. - Another stack Mr. Carroway? - No thanks, I'm through for the night. All right, I'll take your seat and see if I can win back some dough for the house. I'm going after you Lady. That's swell Duke, I've been waiting for you all evening. - Hi you Bermuda. - Well, hello Norway. - No matter where you go, I'll find you. - So I noticed. Say Duke, I want a cut in on the game tonight, brought you a couple of customers. Well boys, now that you're inside, what's it going to cost me? Sorry Duke, this is one pinch you can't fix. Come on boys, we're taking over. Come on, outside. I'm sorry gentlemen. Get your hats and coats. Well, you sure fooled me brother, I didn't spot you as a copper. - What do you mean? - Where's your badge flatfoot? Say, you fellas got me in an awful jam, you got to get her out of here. I'm sorry lad, but our orders were to bring them all in. Come on boys, come on, outside. Well, hello Mealy, what are you doing here- I thought so. Jerry. Take off the coat, take it off before I slug you. Gee, you must've been afraid of losing. So that's the kind of a bodyguard you turned out to be, a double-crossing crook. Oh, yeah? Well, he's your partner and you brought him in here. Oh, yeah? Take him outside Jerry. Come on girlie, put on your hair net, we're going places. Listen Lady, I give you my word of honor I didn't know anything about it. Drop in for tea some afternoon at the jail. Copper. All right boys, come on. Oh hello Lady, let us get a picture, will you? Ah come on, give the boys a break. Thanks. Well, didn't you tell her that Jim Fallon sent me? Yeah, I told her, she says to tell you the accommodations is swell right here. That's funny. Well, let me talk to her. She tells me she don't want nothing to do with Fallon. Gee, I can't understand that. - Hello Charlie, what's new? - You ought to know, you scum. You're a fine bunch of slugs, pressing the dame's kisser all over the newspapers. Why don't you go out and photograph a murder? - What is this? Another beef? - I'll say it's a beef. - Hello Joe, what's up? - Well, she won't step out for Fallon. Right, I'll put the fix on. What you'll take for Lady Lee? - That depends, who you represent? - Charlie Lang Limited. Come on, make it snappy, will you kid? I got to get a train. It must be around here somewhere. I wouldn't know where it is,. I'm a corporation counsel, not a criminal attorney. Maybe this is it. - Is this where you bail people out? - Yes sir. - Hello kid. - Oh, hello Lang. I have here in my possession a court order... signed by justice Aloysius Boering of the Supreme Court... for the release of one Jennifer Lady Lee. I'm very sorry sir, this gentleman is already posted bond. Hi you Charlie. - Sorry to get you up so early. - It's a pleasure, believe me. - Thanks for springing me kid. - Oh, anything for a pal. I want to talk to you Lady. Well, I don't think I'd know you without your uniform. You'll excuse us, won't you kid? We got a date for breakfast. Now, why do you want to pal around with those guys for? They're too unreliable. You're telling me. - Now what? - Yeah, now what. Otto, where did I tell you to put that? - Now, let me see, you wanted me to put this? - Now listen... I told you to put it in storage in the basement. And don't forget if Fallon phones again, you don't know where I've moved to. Yes ma'am. Ginny, put those other things in the box please. - Who is it? - Norway. Well, you've got some nerve copper. Now listen Lady, don't you ever call me that again. I told you last night and I'm here to tell you just once more... I'd nothing to do with that raid, I was an innocent bystander just like yourself. Well then, why do you go prowling around into places when you don't know how to act? Of all the dopey, stupid, greenhorn tricks I'd ever heard of- Bringing two complete strangers into a gambling layout. All right, I'll admit it was stupid, but it certainly wasn't intentional. Now, that's my story and you can take it or leave it. I... I think I'll take it. Can you take it? You want to go dancing? - No. - No. - It is beautiful, isn't it Lady? - Look out, you're liable to get moon-burned. I ever tell you how the moon looks in Norway? Wouldn't do you any good, I'm terrible on snowshoes. - Can you swim? - Not a stroke. Perfect, then we'll book for Venice, what do you say? - I say it's been swell, come on. - Wait a minute Lady. What's your game Lady? Holding out for marriage? No, not exactly but... I figure there's only one way to play the game and that's to play it straight. I'll play straight with you. That's sweet of you Garry. But it wouldn't work out. - I live on the other side of the tracks. - But you move over. - Your folks wouldn't let me. - There's only dad. And if you don't mind, I'd like to have him meet you. I don't mind. Well, here you are Bermuda, here's your breakfast. Well, that's something after riding all night. Say, you sure your father's farm isn't in Norway? No, don't be silly, it's only down here a little way. Well, let's hurry, we'll be just in time to help dad milk the cow. - They'll never let me move over Garry. - Listen Lady, you got to like us, come on. - Dad, Dad. - Hello son. - Why, Lady Lee. - Peter. Well, well, well. Welcome to our city. Why you old rascal, you beat me to the punch again, hear, I thought I'd discovered her. Lady and I are old friends and sinners. - John, bring breakfast for two more. - Yes sir. Wait a minute John, tell Susie to make me... Never mind, I'll tell her myself. Well, this is a surprise. Lady, would you humor an old man? Tell me all about it. Well, I suppose it sounds kind of silly but that mutt wants to marry me. Thanks Susie. Say, you're going to taste a souffle like you've never sniffed before. Garry, we'll excuse you long enough to do something with those tails. The tails can await until I tell you something dad. Oh Garry, it's all right, go ahead. - I don't blame him in the least. - Thanks Peter. - Gee, I never dreamt you were his father. - I believe you. And I'm going to give you 50,000 dollars. Is that a payoff or don't you care if we get married? You misunderstand me, I care very much. That's why I'm willing to pay. Oh, you got me wrong Pete, this don't cost you anything. I... I was invited out here I thought but... I guess I was wrong. Well... - I hope there's no hard feelings. - Oh, no Pete. I understand. What time does the next train leave for New York? That puts me in a very awkward position. How can I incite if you won't hit back? You think you really love him? You're a gambler, I'm a gambler. - Shall we cut? - Not for Garry. Don't you think this is how Mike would've handled it? You've lost Pete. No, I think I won. I pronounce that they are man and wife. In the name of the father... and of the son and of the holy ghost, amen. - You won again. - She's a marvelous system. Come on now darling, we'll get a couple of men to help us... carry this lumber and we'll built that home in Saranac. Oh, not yet, I've got my eye on that gadget up there. Don't you think it'll look cute in our breakfast nook? Now, don't be greedy. Pardon madame, you mistake yourself. You neglect to insure the zero. No fooling, this is a new racket with me. But madame, before Leroy, who broke the bank in 1877. I win again, you break the bank professor, I'll take mine in pieces. - Well, Garry Madison of all people. - Sheila? Darling. - Well. - Didn't you know I was in Europe? - No. - Oh well, I just got back from Cairo. Hey... - Didn't Peter cable you? - Not a word. Cash me in, it's 700,000 francs there. - I'm surprised at you. - You are? Why? What have I done? Nothing, that's just it. You haven't kissed me yet. - Oh, isn't that awful? - Don't you think his technique is improving? Oh, Lady darling, This is Sheila Aiken, one of my oldest friends. You don't mean oldest angel, you mean closest. - How do you do? - I'm really delighted to know you. I've heard the most astounding things about you. You must come down to aunt Emily's for the weekend, we'll have lots of fun. - Well, I'm not sure. - Oh, don't be silly, of course you are. We'll be expecting you. Now, I've got to go. I'm awfully happy to have met you. Oh, how stupid of me, I forgot to return your ring. It's customary, I believe. Good-bye, darlings. - Your credit madame. - Thank you. Oh, how you do? Well, that'll take care of the chandeliers. Now, how about going after the drapes? No, I, I don't feel lucky anymore tonight. What do you feel like doing? - Oh, I feel like going to the hotel. - Well, that's what I feel like doing, too. - What's the matter Bermuda? - Nothing. - Yes, there is. - No, it's really nothing, only... - Only what? - I don't like that Sheila dame. Not that dame, you mean that young Lady, that girl, that woman. - Were you engaged to her? - My sweetheart is jealous. You know, it's very flattering to me, makes me love you even more than before. Now let's forget all about it. I am not and never was engaged to Sheila Aiken, believe me. - Well, why did you give her a ring? - I never saw it before in my life. I'll tell you what you do, when you see her Sunday, you show her those... pretty teeth of yours and make her promise not to sue me for breach of promise. You mustn't take these things so seriously, it's only a game darling. So society is just a racket too. Cut it out. - Having a good time dear? - Well, it's your party Pete, what about you? Confidentially, I wish we were playing a little game of poker somewhere. That's a rubber. My dear child, that last finesse of yours was positively brilliant. You know, you going to have a busy winter of bridge my dear. - It's your deal dear. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I have a secret to tell you. - A new romance? Perhaps, sit down. I, I don't suppose there's any chance of your going to Reno soon? Not a chance. Then you be very glad to know that I'm engaged at last. Off the market, set for life. Well, may I be the first to congratulate you. And you are the first. Now, if you can follow that up with another slam. Oh, yes, yes. - Who is he? - Remember is a secret. Now don't tell me he's married and has a couple of children. No, nothing like that, but he's from a very fine, old English family. The honorable Archibald Clive, with a title in the offings. - Naturally, the family has to vote on me. - When do they count the vote? Archie says we can probably announce it in the spring. Well that's grand, but I feel me wife's... eyes upon me and before the shooting starts, I shall leave you. I'm warning you, you're the first and last to receive my maidenly confidence. Remember, a Madison never tells. There you are, lucky. Well, darling, that straightens us out. You drop in for cocktails sometime, won't you, dear? I'd love to, thank you. My dear Madison, you ought to be proud of your wife. She's a superb bridge player. Oh, that's funny, she's only had a couple of lessons. Why, when she started, she hardly knew a spade from a club. Lady, darling, why don't you show the doctor some of your card tricks? The professional ones, you know, the way you used to win those fabulous sums. Sheila, darling, I don't feel like doing any tricks... unless you want to put up some money. Oh, naturally I couldn't play with you, I'm not in your class. - Afraid to take a chance? - She called you that time Sheila. - What do you want to play for? - Those earrings are very nice. - What we play? - Ladies. 21? Good heavens. Well, it's too bad I didn't catch you at night... when you'd be wearing the family heirlooms. Ready to quit? Not while I have 3 garments left. Now wait a minute Sheila, let's call this quits.. All right Garry. Darling, do me up the back, will you? You're not really serious about keeping them? Of course I am. Why Garry, I really believe she means it. Oh, don't be silly, but if she does, it's nobody is fault but your own. Oh, but you've had your fun darling. Why don't you give them back to her? For the 387th time, no. But darling, she was a guest in our house, that makes a little difference. Doesn't make any difference at all, did that stop her? No, she came right into my own home and tried to make a monkey out of me... intimating that I was crooking money out of my own guests. Well you're not going to have any more trouble with Sheila because she's... Oh Garry, can't you see what she's trying to do? Sweetheart, you know that 100 Sheilas couldn't separate us. - Now come on, give me them, will you? - No. Come on and give me those jewels Jack Dalton or I'll choke you. - No, no, Garry, don't. - No, I'm not kidding. I'm going to bite your ear, I'm going to bite your ear. - Garry, don't. - I'm not finished, I'm not finished. Come in? I beg your pardon madam, Mr. Carter is downstairs. - Mr. Carter? - Sent by a Mr. Charlie Lang. Oh, thank you. Now wait a minute. What's this Lang stuff? - Talk about being jealous. - Yes, I am jealous, so what? - What you going to do about it? - I only be a minute. No, but listen darling... What's giving out on Charlie Lang? I'm afraid Charlie is in serious trouble this time, in fact, he's in jail right now. What's he booked for? Technically, it's a little charge of embezzlement... but the trouble is he knows too much about the syndicate. It'll take a lot of Jack to spring him. Personally, I don't care about fighting the syndicate. - How much dough will it take? - Think I can file him out for about 10 gs. Take a load off your feet brother, I'll be right back. - Garry? - Yeah? - I need 10,000 right away. - 10,000 what? Dollars. Charlie Lang is down in the tombs and I've got to spring him. Oh, he is, is he? Well that's great. That's just where he belongs, that's where I'd have put him long ago. - You mean you won't give me the dough? - No. And I don't expect you to ask dad for it either. - Oh, but Garry, you don't... - Now listen here... I'm just about fed up with this whole Charlie Lang situation... And I don't want you to see any more of him, do you understand that? Yeah, I get it. - Mr. Carter. - Yes? My husband can't get that much cash until the banks open in the morning. But you tell Charlie I'll post the bond as soon as possible. Very well Mrs. Madison. Hello Lady, where you've been keeping yourself? Oh, just dropped in to pick up Charlie Lang. - You got 10 grand? - You bet I have. Send Lang down. Oh, if he's sleeping, don't wake him. I can see him later. Good morning Mrs. Madison. You're a stranger in this part of town, ain't you? Yeah. It wasn't so long ago that I was down here myself. You're still keeping up your friendship with Mr. Lang, I see? Why not? Of course your husband knows all about this. I thought so. Do, do you have to print this? Yeah, I suppose you do. Say, when Lang comes, send him into the press... room, I want to take a couple of pretty pictures of him. Come on, fellas. Ah gee babe, that was swell. No kidding, that was great the way you fronted for me. You did as much for me. Say look, you give me that pawn ticket and I'll have that ice back in the morning. Oh, there's no hurry. Say, that 10 gs is only show money... compared to what I got coming in, come on, give me the ticket. - What you do? Fall into an inheritance? - I'll say I did and I'm loaded with info. It's going to cost somebody plenty. That Fallon shook me down, I'm going to shake him down for a cool 100 gs. - I don't want to hear about it. - What's the matter? You going soft? No, but you ought to know better than to play that shakedown game. Why, it's like fooling with dynamite playing around with those buzzards. Did I say anything? What's the matter? You going nuts. I... I hate to hand you this kid, but... It looks like I'm not going to be able to see you any more. Sure, that's all right. I kind of had that figured. Why, if I was your husband, I wouldn't want another guy grabbing the inside rail either. I'm glad you said that Lang. That's just the way I feel about it. In case I didn't make it plain before I'm telling you now... I don't want you coming here anymore. I don't want you seeing my wife. I don't want to... see your name linked with hers in anymore newspaper publicity. Now you get out of my house and stay out or I'll... Wait a minute, don't get so handy with those IOUs. Wasn't for the fact that Lady was here, I'd... Ok, Charlie. Go on. Beat it. Alright, whatever you say Lady. I'm warning you Madison, from now on, weather cloudy, muddy track, you take my tip. - So you did get the money from my father? - No, I didn't. - Where you get it then? - I pawned Sheila's junk. - You'd do anything, wouldn't you, to save... - Don't say that. Well he was, wasn't he? Figure it out for yourself. And I won't be here while you're making up your mind. Wait a minute. - Where's that pawn ticket? - I gave it to Charlie. - Where is he live? - I wouldn't know. Well I'll find him if it's the last thing I'd do. Yes. Sure, that's my pawn ticket. When did you see it last? Yesterday afternoon when I gave it to Charlie Lang. He's a pretty good friend of yours, isn't he? - What's the matter with him now? - Nothing. Except that he's bumped off last night. - He was... - Yes. Who did it? According to headquarters it was your husband. - Well, you're crazy, my husband... - Yes, that's what we thought. Until we found out that your husband trailed Lang to a speakeasy. They quarreled over this pawn ticket. A little later, Lang's body was found in the alley and the ticket was gone. We picked up your husband... in a peerless loan office this morning with the ticket on him. Well, figure it out yourself. Peter, Peter... Garry didn't do this thing, it was that racetrack mob. Charlie told me himself... yesterday afternoon that he was loaded with information playing a shakedown game. Don't you get the picture? Somebody wanted him out of the way. Your husband had a perfect motive, Jealousy. He quarreled with Lang in a public place about a pawn ticket. When he was arrested, the pawn ticket was found on him. - Maybe Charlie gave it to him. - Well, that's what your husband claims. But when Lang left the speakeasy, he had the ticket on him. When his body was found in the alley 3 hours later, the ticket was gone. Why don't you ask Garry where he was during those 3 hours? Now, what do you think we've been doing all morning? If you get it out of him, you are doing better than our whole investigating staff. Go to it Lady, he's waiting down the hall in room 36. Well, as I see it, there's one way to handle it. You could claim the unwritten law. - Well that's impossible. - Oh no Garry, you must consider. Lady. I want to speak to my wife alone Cornelius. - Oh, you needn't go dad. - Don't go. Yes, I want to ask Cornelius a question. - Did you do it? - No. How you get the ticket? Charlie Lang followed me into the street and gave it to me. Then where you go? Where you go, Garry? Well, I don't like to seem ungracious Lady, but... this is something you'll have to let me handle myself. That's all right for other people, but you don't have to stall me. Where did you go Garry? I know this sounds stupid when you're trying to help me. But you of all people Lady ought to understand. With your code of ethics and fine sense of loyalty, I'm not alone in this. - There are other people involved. - Yeah? But don't forget Pete and me when you're passing out some of that loyalty. If you've got an alibi, spring it. Oh Garry, please tell me about it. I'll go on the stand for you. Then he was only a friend, Wasn't he? Garry. Ok. I think I catch on. Lady. Lady. What time did Garry check out of here last night? - I've never been so insulted in all my life. - He was here, wasn't he? I can appreciate your state of mind Lady. May I drop you someplace in my way downtown? I'm sorry... But I've been nearly half crazy with worry. Oh, Lady... Suppose Garry had been here last night, what would that mean to you? Everything. - Enough to make you divorce him my dear? - Not in a million years my dear. Every guy is entitled to one mistake. Quite true, but I'm not that mistake Lady, you are. I guess you're right. I... I suppose I had that coming to me. Then Garry was here last night, wasn't he? Ok Sheila, you don't have to talk. I'll put your servants on the stand and mine it out of them. Please give me credit. If I entertained a man in my apartment last night... you may be sure that I was discreet enough not to let anyone know but myself. Do you think Garry is dumb enough to risk his life to save your reputation? Happens to be a little more than my reputation my dear. Garry knows what no one else knows, that I'm engaged to marry a very wealthy man. Naturally, if I gave him an alibi, would ruin my entire life. - You see? - I'll see. Now it's beginning to make sense. Let's finish out our little supposing game. - What will it take to make you talk? - You'll file suit for a divorce immediately. Anything else? I want your promise not to tell Garry or anyone else about our little understanding. You think Garry is going to marry you after it's all over? I'm positive. You see, you're going to ask for a cash settlement of 250,000 dollars... and you're going to name me as correspondent. You think of all the answers, don't you? Ok, Sheila... I'll think it over. Come in. Peter. I've been trying to find some explanation of what you've done Lady. Well, I thought I made it plain, I want a divorce. But that's not like you Lady. I even thought you were trying to find some alibi for Garry. Have you any reason to believe he was with Sheila the night that Lang was killed? Enough to satisfy me. - Sheila's word for it. - She admits it, that's marvelous. I'll phone her now and we'll run her right down... to the District Attorney's office to make her statement. There's no need to bother. - She's already on her way down there now. - Good. Forgive me dear, I realize this must've been a shock to you. But now it's all over, you can drop the feud and put things right with Garry. - What do you mean drop it? - Well... you're not going to let this interlude destroy your marriage. You're not the first woman that's had to face this situation. Ah, come, promise me you'll give Garry another chance. Lady... look at me. Oh, can't I get a divorce without going through a third degree? So it's the alimony. You picked the first moment that Garry needs his wife's loyalty to cash in. All right. Get out and stay out. And now then... Then Garry Madison remained with me in my apartment on the night in question... from the hour of 9 until 6:30 the following morning. I, Sheila Aiken, make this deposition on my own free will and without coercion... and in the presence of my attorney, is this correct? - Yes. - Miss Aiken? Yes. - Sign here please. - Where? Right here miss Aiken. And now, Mr. District Attorney... you will surely quash the indictment and release Mr. Madison at once. - Of course. - Thank you very much, good day everyone. And this is the finding in this case. In view of these facts, I hereby give an order to agree granting the plaintiff, Jennifer Lady Madison, an absolute divorce. And in said honor, full rights shall be restored to the plaintiff... enjoyed for her prior marriage to the defendant in this case. The court is adjourned. Lady, I did it for you, let me congratulate you. The divorce is just been granted Garry, you're now a free man. Oh, that's great Cornelius. - Is Mrs. Madison still in the courtroom? - Why yes, sir. - I'd like to see her. - You know once- Yes I know, but I'd like to talk to her Cornelius. - You wanted to see me Garry? - Oh, yeah, come in. I just want to take a good look at you. - Well, I guess that's about all, isn't it? - No, not quite. There's one little pleasure I reserved for myself. - What's that? - You ought to know, the payoff. You know, I think you've been wasting an awful lot of your valuable time. What do you mean? You could've gotten twice as much money from Pete before we were married. - Why you petty larceny... - Now don't get excited, the check is good. - It ought to make you very happy. - Happy? Of course I'm happy. You don't think that you could ever make me happy, do you? Remember the time I said there was only one way to... play a game and that was to play it straight? - Why didn't you play the hand out? - I did play the hand out. - Oh, don't make me laugh. - Laugh? What have you got to laugh about? I'm the one that's laughing. And I'm going to keep on laughing every time I hear your name. And every time I hear yours I'll remember what a quitter you were. Right, I was a quitter, but now I'm going to be a beginner. From now on I'm going to begin to live. Really live, on your dough, that's the funny part of it. Well, I'm sorry you can't join me big boy. Remember, when in doubt, lead with your ace. So long kid, my love to Sheila. Am I laughing? Garry, Garry, come here. - Why you glaring at me? - I'm not glaring at you. - What's the matter? Are you nervous? - Certainly not. - Garry, whatever is the matter with you? - Nothing. I just want to ask you a question. Well? You ever have any idea that I was going to marry you? - Well, naturally. - Well, I'm sorry, because I'm not. - Is Peter been interfering? - Peter? Why no. - Have you been talking to Lady? - Well, yes of course. You didn't think just because she divorced me I wasn't going to see her anymore. Please sir, let me go back in the kitchen. If you don't do it, there'll be no kitchen to go back to. Now take that phone, you know what you're going to say, don't you? Yes sir. That's all right, I'll get it. I'm expecting a call. Hello? - Hello, this is Lady. - Oh, hello Lady darling. Yes, well I'll be over there in about an hour. Yes, I'm talking to her about it right now. To think that I should've trusted that double crossing little tramp. It was a frame, wasn't it? Tell me, did you hear what I said? Tell me. Dad? Dad. - Dad? - What's happened? - It worked. - Good. You find out from her attorney where she lives? - She's sailing for Norway at midnight. - Norway? - Pryor, my have me coat. - Come on Pryor. Come on, dad. - What happened boy? - Sheila confessed everything. - Yes? Well? - Well, I'll tell you the rest on the boat. Come on Pryor, quick. Thank you. - Come on, give me his cane. - Thank you. No, I won't need my trunks during the voyage but will you ask the stewardess... to please serve breakfast in here at 11. - Very well miss. - Thank you. - Who is it? - Norway. Hello Bermuda, Sheila told me everything. Come on, forgive me, will you kid? Take a chance Lady and forgive us both, I think Mike would.
