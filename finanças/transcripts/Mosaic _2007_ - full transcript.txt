Okay, I think that does it. All right. Let's go. Felix, we'll see you over at the east wing. Don't take too long. Still got that mummy... Hmm. This way! Freeze! Wha... Shots came from over here! Are you sure?Yeah! Move! What the hell is that? If we shadows have offended, think but this, and all is mended. that you have but slumbered here while these visions did appear, and this weak and idle theme... ...no more yielding than a dream. Gentles, do not reprehend. If you pardon, we will mend. And as I am an honest Puck, and if we have unearned luck, now to 'scape the serpent's tongue, we will make amends ere long. Else the Puck a liar call, so good night unto you all. Give me your hands if we be friends, and Robin shall restore amends. Special delivery for the most talented actress in all of New York City. Stephan, you came! I wouldn't have missed it for the world. Did my dad leave these with you? Uh, yeah... Y-Yeah! He said to tell you he was sorry he had to leave early. Said you'd understand. That's just like him, but at least you stayed until the end. How could I leave? You were riveting. You're so sweet. Give me a sec to get changed. You can walk me home. Don't change too much, Maggie. You're perfect just the way you are. Look at him. Who's this? Can I help you? Near as I can tell, nothing was taken. That makes it a local murder. How does this involve Interpol? Cheese and crackers! What the heck happened to him? I'll let you know as soon as I do. Grrr! Okay, people, give me what you got. Hmm. Hey, sorry, fella. Would hate to have to brought you all the way from Africa only to... Nelson. We have a dead alien here. Where are you? Something came up. I had to check it out. What is it? What did you find? Not over the phone. The park. Across the street from the office. Ten minutes. Ten minutes. What was so important he couldn't have waited a few more minutes? Your dad works for Interpol, and the whole world is his precinct. But, as busy as he is... He came tonight, and I appreciate it. It's just, I know in his heart, he doesn't get the whole acting thing. He doesn't appreciate how similar we are. Him being an international investigator, and you? And me being an actress, yes! Where do you think I get my impeccable eye for detail? Maggie Nelson, multinational secret agent? Now, there's a scary thought. Why not? I've studied martial arts... Ha! Fencing... ha. Target practice and horseback riding... You realize most young actresses wait tables? Speaking of which, double caramel mocha frap on me? Yeah. But my treat. We're celebrating your opening night. Well, let's go, Candice. I haven't got all night. Where are you? Where are you? I'm in the park. You said to meet... I'm not in the park. I'm at the museum, where you should be explaining to me what this creature is doing here wearing a guard's uniform! Ha ha! At long last, eh, Agent Nelson? I'm sorry. I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage, sir. I've been called many things over the years. I happen to have grown a particular fondness for Manikin. It suits me, as I put on guises easily. Pleased to finally make your acquaintance. Though it isn't as if you haven't tried, following me all over the globe and back again. Now, you have something that belongs to me. Ha! I don't really need that woman's stone, but it would make my task a lot easier... Damned noisy, that gun of mine. Grrr! Watch your back. Shots have been fired. Let's go, men. Search around. Is he alive?Call an ambulance. ♪ I am, 'cause I keep on changin' ♪ ♪ I like who I see In the mirror in front of me ♪ ♪ But sometimes I feel like a triple hot man ♪ ♪ Ruled by my head, Ruled by my passion ♪ ♪ Keep jumpin' till I feel like somethin' ♪ ♪ You could really start chewin' ♪ ♪ The cold wind's killin' me Yeah. ♪ Standin' right in front of me ♪ Ooh, tough crowd. With me here in the studio is Mr. Mix, reptile-at-large, a gift from my globetrotting parental unit and the subject of my science term project. May I say, sir, I'm a big fan of your work. A chameleon does naturally what an actor works so hard at. It's why I chose to do my bio term paper on you and your ilk. Ilk. I love that word. Right. We so have to talk to Dad about getting me my own computer. Aah! No-o! You've got it?Yeah. Can it be? Maggie! Are you okay? Uh, is she okay? Mags, if... if something happened to you, I don't know... Lightning! Pow.Huh? Crackle. Ouch! Uh, yeah. I think so. Thanks for letting me in. I think we'll be all right now. Yeah, well, I gotta go to the basement and check the breakers. I warned you about using a computer in the middle of a storm. Whoa. This is radical. You're telling me. Mags, you sure you're okay? Yeah.You're not acting okay. Are you saying I'm a bad actress? How the heck did you... How the heck did I... Very funny. I came because I heard you shout out, not to get made fun of. What? Steph, what did I say? You imitated me. I did? Um, can I have some... water? Hmm. Aah! Huh? What is it? What's wrong? I just saw... something I couldn't have. Thanks. Maggie, listen. Just now... when I wasn't sure if you were gonna be okay, it made me realize I have something I really need to tell... Hello? Yes, Margaret Nelson. What's wrong? We'll see him in a moment, Maggie. Room 416. Wha... While you're here, you might want to get checked out yourself, Maggie. I'm fine. You may have been struck by... Stephan, it's my dad I need to worry about right now. Dad! I'll wait downstairs. Hey, Magpie. Oh, Daddy, shh. Don't try to talk. Yeah. I'm sorry about leavin' your play. You know sometimes the real world... Gets in the way of the acting world. I know, and... you know how much I love you. Nurse? Someone? No, no. It's okay, Magpie. Promise me. Anything. Keep your grades up. Go to college. Get a real job. Something safe and secure? Yeah. Like an Interpol agent? Magpie, you were great tonight. Better than great. Your mother would have been so proud. I'm so proud. You ace your term paper... I'll... I'll read lines with ya. Deal, Daddy. Is he okay? Can you tell me... What's going on? Huh? Where did they go? How could they get past us? We have to find them, or "M" will melt us alive. "M"? How did I do that? Margaret? Your father needs his rest. Who are you? I'm his boss, Special Agent Newell. I must insist you come along. What happened to him? That's classified. I've been an Interpol agent's daughter my whole life. I should have seen that non-answer coming. Is he gonna be okay? I'm not a doctor. You're not the most sensitive person in the world, either, are you? My job is to find the person or people responsible for what happened to your father, Miss Nelson. Would you rather I do that, or fall to the floor in tears? We'll have guards posted 24/7. What should I do? Go home, Maggie. You have a paper due tomorrow, don't you? Your dad talks about you all the time. He does? Go get some rest. I want you two to stay on guard here. Special Agent Newell? No one... Please call me when he wakes up. Steph, he looks so weak. It'll be okay, Mags. It will.Stephan, you're always there for me. What was it you were gonna tell me earlier? It can wait. I'll get us a cab. Thanks. Taxi! Taxi! Don't think you're getting another nibble until you explain what the heck happened to me. Mm, here. I could understand getting bitten by a radioactive chameleon, but lightning? How is it that I can copy your abilities? And why isn't anything happening now? Maybe I imagined the whole thing. Aah! No. No! Aah! No! Aah! Maggie, you okay? Steph, don't you ever sleep? I was thinking about what happened to your dad. Maybe if we went through some of his papers. Y-Yeah? Just to see what he was up to. You know, before he was attacked? How did you know? I'm not the one who should be answering questions right now, starting with who, or what are you? The closest English pronunciation of my name that I could come up with is "Mosaic." As to what I am... "M!" Who? What? You're "M." You sent those men to get my dad. Why? No. That wasn't me. That's the man I'm looking for. He often calls himself Manikin. You're probably a bit confused right now. Golly gosh, ya think? You deserve an explanation. Good student that you are, I'm sure you know about the origins of man, homo sapiens. Uh, right. Okay. Well, there was another branch to that tree. Homo chameleal. That's what we are descended from. We meaning you and this Manikin guy? We meaning my people. When the continents were one, we lived on a large island in what you call the Indian Ocean. And for thousands of years as we evolved, mutated, we were isolated by the sea from other humans. We developed abilities that helped us survive. We forged a society, became a civilization unto ourselves: the Chimera. Just as we were able to change ourselves, so were there those among us who could imbue metal and stone with abilities they were never meant to possess: alchemy. The few times we left our home to come in contact with the human world... to be honest, it never ended well. Nearly 300 years ago, a natural disaster devastated our island paradise. Chimera was mostly claimed by the sea. Or scattered into other lands. We tried to blend in with the human population. So you stayed hidden all this time? Well, let's just say we've tried. Then why are you here now? Several years ago, a movement began to try to rebuild our dying civilization. We met in remote places in secret. The human world had forgotten about us, and our experience was such that we chose to be careful and remain hidden. But there was this one, a revolutionary, who decided we shouldn't let the human race dominate us anymore. He argued that our science and technology were far superior to anything the humans had snatched by archeologists and thieves and left to gather dust in museums by fools who had no clue to their power. Gathering them together, there was no reason we could not use the alchemical power of the chameleal to hold dominion over the earth. A few of our people began to agree with him. The Council rightfully rejected his cause. Let me guess: his name was Manikin. Yes. Manikin left Chimera, and took his followers with him. A select handful of us were dispatched to apprehend him. So, you're a chameleon...cop? Something like that. What does any of this have to do with what happened to my father? In recent months, Manikin began retrieving these ancient objects from various museums around the world... leading here to New York City. I have been tracking him. So, apparently, had your father. I had placed chameleal agents in various museums. Tonight, one was killed. So those are the thefts my dad's been investigating. And this Manikin guy attacked him because... I don't know why. He'd already escaped with the sacred eye stone of Chimera. Um, yeah, so... This is all pretty ridiculous. Contrary to popular belief, not every drama club geek has a phaser in her locker, and all 10 hours of Lord of the Ringson DVD. Clueless. Admit it. You know about as much about my world as I know about yours. You need my help. Nonsense. You would serve no other function than to be in my way. Quite a line you got there, Mo. You really know how to charm the ladies, eh? Let us be frank, Maggie. You are an actress. Guilty as charged, but I'm an actress... who can do this. Sod's blood! Well, you think that's impressive, I'm just getting started. I don't understand. You're only human. Never in the history of our separate races has there ever been a human who shared our abilities. Yeah, well, practice, practice, practice. That's my motto. Earlier, I sensed something. Tell me, did anything unusual happen to you? Other than my father being hurt, not that I can think of. No. Nope, sorry. There was an ancient myth, I always thought it was little more than a child's tale. When there came a time of great darkness, a mighty chameleal warrior, who could stand between two worlds, would walk the earth. Uh, yeah. That's me. Little old camelia at your service. This Manikin guy hurt my father. I don't know if you know what it's like to see your dad in pain. For whatever reason, I can do these things. I don't care how long it takes, how high or low I have to search for this guy. What do we do next? I'm so gonna have to learn that trick. Mr. Mix, what did you get me into? Uhhh! Too easy. Cool! Hi, there's Tom!Oh, crap. I love him! Oh, my gosh! I'll get him. Mom! That looks like Spiderman. See? Up there on the building. You've been reading too many comic books, young man. Gotta remember to be more careful. Hmm. Whoa. Get a grip, girl. Visiting hours at the hospital don't start for a couple of hours. Maybe they have a chameleon exhibit. Wow, it's amazing how closely we're related. Couple of DNA strands different, and I'd never be able to shave all the hair off my legs. Ha ha ha! Hey, sweetie. Where ya goin'? Yeah. Wanna party? Hey, don't walk away! Stay. Aah! Huh? The two guys you're looking for are hiding right over there, behind that clump of bushes. All right, you two, come out with your hands nice and high, so I can see 'em. That was kind of fun. This is so weird. I seem to be able to see people's and animal's DNA. Once I see it, I can change into it. I can blend into the background and essentially disappear. How, and why, did this happen to me? Was I holding Mr. Mix when the lightning struck? Maybe some of his abilities got zapped into me. If I've got some of his abilities, I wonder if I've got any of his weaknesses? Well, I'll have to do more study on that later. Or I won't make it to the hospital on time. Oh, Maggie. Stephan!Huh? I tried to catch you before you left this morning, but I...overslept. I can imagine. After everything that's happened, you must... I must need help with my term paper. Exactly. Stephan, you're the smartest person I know. I need you to tell me everything you know about chameleons. Uh, sure. I got a private science lab session right now, but we can talk at lunch. No! I need your help now. Lunch might be too late. What? Your paper isn't due until... Mr. Bullwraith! I'm sure there is a reason why the bell has still rung and you are both still here in the hallway? Yes, sir!No, sir. Um... I have to talk to Stephan now. Wow! No sign of the real Principal Bullwraith. Aha!Huh? I caught you at last. Mrs. Notten... Ahem. Mrs. Nottenmyer. So what can I do for the school's librarian today? You can address the matter of overdue books at the next school assembly, if you would. It would be a pleasure. Now, if you'll excuse me, Mrs. Nottenmyer... No problem, Mr. Bullwraith. Oh! I'll be in my office during lunch hour. Again. There are just some things a student shouldn't know about her teachers. There you are. Maggie. What are you doing here? Are you in some kinda trouble? Is there anything... Please, Stephan, focus. I need you. You need me? Uh... Yes, I need your encyclopedic brain. Do chameleons have any weaknesses? Weakness?Margaret. There's been a problem. Taken?Yes. You had guards there. I saw them. How did it happen? Apparently, someone signed for his release. Someone who looked exactly like me. An imposter, who managed to fool two agents that have worked with me for 12 years. Where are we going? You're the most important thing in your father's life. If anything happens to you... I don't need you to protect me. Your townhouse has already been ransacked, torn apart. They know where you live. Besides, your father would want me to look out for you. Maggie! What are you... Come on! Get out of the street! Hey! Move that thing! I know I can find my dad faster than they can. They're not gonna keep me under lock and key. Thanks, Stanley. Stanley, I need a favor. I've left my security badge home, and I need you to issue me a temp visitor's badge. Sure, no problem, Agent Newell. I just need you to confirm your I.D. with your thumbprint here. Show time! This is a little awkward. I can explain. Not necessary, Mosaic. I still don't understand how you have the ability to see past my disguise. Can't you see my DNA? Uh, no. You can do that? Not to worry, Mo, when you've been doing this as long as I have. So, what did we find out? We? These are the places your father has tracked Manikin for the past year. And there's only one place not yet checked off. Rome. Hmm. I've always wanted to go to Italy. On three. Do you smell gunpowder? I'm sorry?Uh-oh. What-oh?I'll meet you there, okay? Everyone freeze. Everyone meaning me? Arrest this woman. She's an impostor! Not funny. But you have to admit, this is kinda funny, right? Sorry. Finally, a fan club, and they're out to kill me. Sorry, no time for autographs. She's like a chameleon. Hold it right there. I.D., please. All right. Go ahead. Hmm? Ah. Maggie! Shh.Maggie. What's going on? The police, federal agents, your apartment... It's something my dad's mixed up in. You know, Interpol stuff. I thought your dad was still in the hospital. How's he doing? He's been kidnapped, Stephan. And they've broken into our place and torn it apart. That's horrible. What are you gonna do? They're putting me in a safe house until they get my dad back. Listen, Stephan, I'm not really supposed to be here, but I had to get some of my stuff, you know? Anyway, I gotta go before anyone sees me and I get into trouble. So don't tell anyone you saw me here, okay? Oh, sure. I get it. Listen, Maggie, you take care, okay? Don't do anything foolish. I'd had to have something happen to you. I mean, I'd... It's just that, well, you... You're... I know, Stephan. I'll be careful. Things will work out. My dad will be fine. And we'll both be back before you know it. I love you, Maggie. There you go. Flight 123 to Rome is now ready for final boarding. Wait! Huh! Just made it. You're good. What you lack in experience, you make up for with your natural ability to improvise. Mosaic? How did you know it was me? And how come you're not in disguise yourself? I only knew it was you because I was looking out for you, and noticed the flight attendant enter the rest room, and you stepped out. I'm not in disguise, because, well, frankly, no one will recognize me. Good point. I guess I have a lot to learn about my new, um, powers. Golly gosh, ya think? We'll be dimming the lights for the rest of the flight to Rome, Italy. The truth is, very little in life is what it appears to be, Maggie. Like the artifacts my father has been known to chase down all across the planet? Among other things, yes. Now, we might be in for quite the ordeal. We're not exactly sure what to expect when we arrive in Rome, and while you will no doubt resist the notion, you should at least try to get some rest. Don't take this the wrong way, but when you finally settle on a face, you're kinda cute. Uh, thank you? My mom used to travel. She was a writer. That's how she and my dad met. She always said she wanted to take me to Europe. It's just all so... beautiful. This city, this day... I guess it's just hard for me to believe that we're on the trail of some evil, master criminal. More than just a criminal. Manikin believes that he has within his grasp the power to rule the world. Okay, well, that puts it in perspective. Thanks. Well, here we are. Are you serious? Manikin came all this way for a loaf of bread? The chameleal are not the only ones who disguise things in plain sight. Grazie Ciao. Are those... bones? Hundreds... no, thousands of bones? The Cripta dei Cappuccini houses the remains of exhumed Capuchin monks. The concept of having bones in a chapel isn't unique. For centuries, it was common to have a bone or a lock of hair of a venerated person as a relic in a church. What distinguishes the Capuchin crypt is the unabashed and flamboyant manner in which the bones are displayed. Cardinal Antonio Barberini, who was of the Capuchin order, in 1631 ordered the remains of thousands of Capuchin monks exhumed and transferred from the friary of Via de Lucchese to the crypt. The crypt now contains the remains of 4,000 monks buried between 1500 and 1870, during which time the Papal States permitted burial in and under churches. Come along, now. Come along. Oh, and please don't touch the femurs. A camera and a bunch of bagged lunches. What do you think that means? Several tourists came through here? I'll bet they were named Manikin and his Gumby goon squad. The guys from the hospital. It's what I was telling Stephan: eye for detail. Stephan your boyfriend? Stephan my best friend. We could wander down here for days and never find them. Not to worry, Mo. We're right on their heels. Head straight up that way. It was paved with blood! I can understand what he's saying. At the sight of your dark harvest, at this consecrated ground where you stood your last, rise again and deliver on your prophecy. I understand what he's saying, but I don't understand what he's saying. What's going on? If that's what I think it is, what's going on is not good. Here, at the site where the treachery of your race was brought to bear, here, where the disciples of Chimera at long last sought their destiny... here, where we lost our brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, husbands...and wives. Ahh. We always thought Manikin had ulterior motives in collecting our sacred totems. But the Hive Council never envisioned this. What? What, tell me. Whose mummy is that? The body interred in that sarcophagus? Facade. I guess you'd call her the high priestess of Chimera. The shaman. She was also Manikin's wife. But she's been dead for over... We live a long time. Wait. How old are you? Centuries ago, here at the Via Veneto you were betrayed by the weak and the blind of your own race, and murdered by these animals that call themselves human. He's saying we humans were responsible for the death of his wife and all these other people here? You need to know the whole story. Facade had a brilliant mind. She took the practice of alchemy to a whole new level, no longer bound by tools and other apparatus. She was able to transform elements by sheer will. The Midas touch. Yes. Sort of. You can guess the origin of that legend. But this power drove her mad. She schemed to rule the world, both chameleal and human. So the races actually teamed up to defeat her? Where did... And so, you have teamed up again. At least when you took on my wife, you had the sense to send overwhelming numbers. I feel slighted. Where's my father? How endearing! You actually care for this young human. Really? Me? Huh? A human who can wield our powers? Then the legend has come to life. The Chimeran Princess, at last! At your service. Ohh! Don't move. I have no idea why you want whatever it is you want, but you having it can only be a bad thing. I think I'll take this. Gone, eh? Or perhaps not as gone as she would like to be. Oh, yeah. That'll help. You must be quite impressed with yourself. A human, to have acquired the abilities of the long-lost chameleal. But you will discover there is a difference between ability and experience. I'm as big a fan of improvisation as the next girl, but this is crazy. Uh-oh. Anomaly or no, you are beneath my contempt, human. I'm an actress, Manny. I'm beneath everyone's contempt. There. Now, in a moment, you'll be beneath a ton of earth and stone. Come on, Maggie. You may be scared, but you don't have to act like it. Funny, isn't it, Special Agent Newell? You're always five minutes behind us. Hmm. Mo, you're okay. Don't.Don't be stubborn. I mean, don't call me Mo. Nice, huh? Nothing a little pancake make-up won't heal. Shape-shifter, right. Forgot. You need rest. I cannot. We've got to go. Now. Time is of the essence. Where are we going?Where else? After Manikin. Well, where is he going? Didn't you notice the map on the wall? The magnetic top of the earth. The North Pole? Close enough.Mosaic? Do you think my father is with him? And still alive? I don't know for sure. But I think so. Manikin doesn't do things for no reason. He must have some reason for kidnapping your father. And therefore, keeping him alive. Colonel Vespucci. It is an honor that you will be pursuing the transport jet that was stolen from here only half an hour ago. Let us-a not waste-a time standing here talking about it, Captain. I can't believe we're stealing a jet. We're not stealing it as much as we're borrowing it. And you can fly this thing? It wouldn't be the first time I've had to pass myself off as a pilot. You pick things up here and there. What happens when they discover the real pilot and copilot are still in the mess hall eating dinner? By then, we will be far away. The fate of the world hangs in the balance. I have finally pieced together his master plan. Master plan? You are in serious need of a script doctor, Mo. Script doctor? Go on. Why is he trying to resurrect his wife? That is not an option. Even for our race, dead is dead. Manikin has figured out how to transfer his wife's abilities to himself. Maybe I am stupid, but why is this so earth-shattering? He would have absolute power. He would be like a god. Imagine what he could do. He could change oil into water, or water into oil. Industrialized nations would fall to their knees before him. Dad was right. This whole acting thing suddenly feels empty and stupid, when you consider the world is at stake. I hope he's still alive to hear my apology. Don't be so hard on yourself. Would you say farmers are stupid, or doctors, or the police? No, but they feed people. They heal people. The police protect us. They feel and heal and protect their bodies, yes. But it is acting that feeds their minds. Gives them hope. It takes them from what is, and envelops them in what might be. Do not ever forget that. Oh, my gosh! I totally forgot! What? I've got midterms on Monday. I don't have any of my books with me. How am I gonna study? I'm gonna flunk out. I'm so dead. Oh, the Borealis Stone. The lay lines on the ancient map all led here. The hardest totemic icon to find is also the most powerful one. Soon, soon! You're probably wondering why I brought you here. Actually, I couldn't give a... I need a life-spark for the final element. I thought, for all your tenacity, for every time you peered into the darkness while others would turn away, it would be a fitting reward that you be in no small part responsible for my ascendancy! You're welcome. What was that? It has begun.I see him. I see my father. He's still alive! We have to hurry. Remember our plan. Here. Take this magnesium flare. You tried to lead them. And they killed you, my beloved. Now. Now I will, at long last, assume your rightful throne! Facade. My beloved. This is why you bring me back, my husband? To watch you repeat my mistakes? Did you learn nothing? That was a long time... And you have spent all this time wanting nothing but revenge? Do you not see that the power you crave will poison you as it did me? Who are you?A friend. In the time you've been gone... I understand more than you can imagine. I know that the cycle of revenge only leads to the mutual destruction of all life. I know that a person must always stand for what is right, or he will fall for anything. Liar! Where I come from, we call it acting. No! Your star turn as the Chameleon Princess was only designed to distract me so that your ally could plant the explosives. Cut and print. That's a wrap. Now it's up to you, Mosaic, to get my father out of here alive. Aah! Thank you, son. I couldn't have... Huh? Oh, my sweet Lord. Next! The Hive Council sent you? No, Father. I volunteered. He's your dad? Facade was your mother? You would have expected nothing less of your only son. You should be fighting by my side for our people! Our people? Our heritage? Everything my mother believed in before the power drove her mad? That is why I must stand against you, Father. Mosaic! Aah! Aah! No-o! Nate, are you okay? You don't know what I saw, Candice. For the past several years, I've been cataloguing anomalies. Evidence of a hidden race that walks among us. Disguised as humans. They can take our shape. Until tonight, I hadn't seen any with my own eyes. But now that I have, now that I know the threat is real, I swear, I won't rest until every last one is destroyed. Every last one, Dad? Even me? I don't know why you chose me. Heck, I don't even know if it was you or the Hive Council, or if it was just some kind of cosmic accident. But I can tell you this... I'm not going to let anyone down. I'm going to track down the rest of the chameleal artifacts out there, and well, somehow, I know you're going to help. I'm gonna use the power to be different. To make a difference. Come in! I brought you a double caramel mocha frap. Thanks. That's so sweet. I, uh... hear it's good for mending a broken heart. You can tell?Yeah. I know that look. Stephan, you just don't know what it feels like to lose someone you love, someone who never knew how you felt. Oh, I think I can imagine. Mags. Why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? Oh, that. Did you expect anything less? Maggie, a lot has happened in the last few days. Things that I'm not at liberty to talk about. But it's why, more than ever, I want to make sure you keep your grades up. Study hard, so that you have the security of a career to fall back on. She's got a career. Here, Maggie. Here's those playbooks you asked me to pick up. Hamlet? You tryin' out for the part of Hamlet? "If not I, who?" Isn't it traditionally a part played by a man? That's why they call it acting, Daddy. Come on, Dad. A promise is a promise. You have to read lines with me. Well, if you're playin' Hamlet, which part do I read? I'm not readin' Ophelia. You can play Laertes. Or the clown. I think I'll take Laertes. Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him, Horatio: A fellow of infinite jest, Of most excellent fancy: He has borne me on his back a thousand times... What is he, whose grief bears such an emphasis, whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand, like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I, Hamlet the Dane! The devil take thy soul. Thou prayest not well, I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat. Mosaic and Manikin are gone, and perhaps all the chameleals. But they have left a part of them in me, for better or for worse. It's up to me to find a way to use this gift for the good of mankind.
