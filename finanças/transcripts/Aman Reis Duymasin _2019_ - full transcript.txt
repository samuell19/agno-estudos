Netflix Official Subtitles icnghn I asked you to come all the way out here, but during our investigation we discovered that they were family and close friends of yours. What happened to them? What did they do? Do you want me to list them all? Please. Ömür Façali, Hatice Kalkandere, and Emine Ispirli… they opened fire in a public area. The women opened fire? Exactly, Mr. Hizir. Zafer Zarali… he attacked a dog and bit it. Zafer bit a dog? Yes. Mr. Zafer bit the dog. And what did they do? Brother-in-law, Murat Ispirli, and Tekin Kutlu… they raided a condolence house. They injured six people, four of them severely. They raided a condolence house? Unfortunately. And… what did the man dressed like Caesar do? Boran Kayali… he is accused of behaving improperly in a public area. What did he do? He was caught naked in a campsite. And what about those two? What did they do? Your brother, Ilyas Çakirbeyli, and Behzat Façali… they were caught during our team's narcotics operation. Narcotics operation? Yes, narcotics operation. Lads, I'm glad we thought about taking a vacation. Exactly, chief. Well, you're right, boss. It's you who really deserves this vacation. We all deserve it, Tekin. We all deserve it. Blowing up here and there all winter long. Let's blow ourselves up a little bit too, huh? -Zafer? -Yes, chief? Do you know how to swim? Chief, in Sivas they called me "the water dog." Zafer, drop it, for God's sake. There's no sea in Sivas. We would swim in the Kizilirmak River, brother. It's not as if I'm lying. Well, you're right. Zafer, do you know any foreign languages? What if we get in contact with the Russian there? I hope language won't be a problem. Of course, chief. I know every language. Russian, Spanish… Understand? Yes, thank you. Do you understand? -Tekin, turn the music on. -Okay, boss. Zafer, hold the steering wheel. I don't want any accidents or trouble. Let's get there in one piece. -Boss, I wish you had-- -I can't hear you. Turn the volume down. Boss, I wish you had insisted that Chief Behzat sit in the back with you. Oh, no. Why would I disturb my comfort by having Mr. Behzat here? Well, you say that, but I think there's definitely going to be a scene in that car. Don't say stuff like that, brother. Zafer, it doesn't matter if I say stuff like that or not. They're like fire and gunpowder together. Tekin, I swear I'm gonna knock you out! Who's the fire, and who's the gunpowder? Don't make me angry. What difference does it make, boss? All I'm saying is, the only thing they need is a spark. And I'm saying, I'm going on vacation. I don't care if a fire breaks out or if there's a scene. Let everyone sit where they want. I don't care. That's it. No one can ruin my fun from now on. So, you're saying we're going into vacation mode, chief? We're already in vacation mode, Zafer. At least I am. Ilyas? If you keep looking backwards, we should swap places. So, should I swap places with Ömür? No, I'll swap places with you. You can look backwards as much as you like while you sit here. I don't know what happens when you look, though. Let's switch places, you and me. We're adults and engaged. This is our first vacation together, Behzat. And I'm saying this so it won't be our last one, Ömür. Praise be, your fiancé's eyes are always on that mirror. God forbid. We need to pay attention to the road. Behzat, if you're not happy, I'll pull over and let you out. You can go in Boran's car. If you look ahead, then I'll be happy. Okay, Behzat, okay. -Hatice? -What? Well... Don't we have any cake, pie, or something like that? I could eat some. You've just had toast, husband. But it was only small. It wasn't enough, Hatice. By the way, I'm sorry. When we go on long journeys like this one, I don't shut up or stop eating until we reach our destination. I wish you had told me, brother-in-law. Tipi could have driven. And you could have eaten whatever you want in comfort. -I don't sit in the front, sister. -Why not? Because of the AC. It hits my chest and makes me feel uncomfortable. Oh, Tipi. Look, I even feel cold here. Hatice, sister, please switch it to hot. What do you mean hot, Tipi? You can have it how you want it for five minutes, and how I want it for 15 minutes. It's 40 degrees outside. Please, don't make us regret having you in our car. Okay, Ms. Emine, I've turned it down. There's no problem. Turning it down isn't enough, Hatice. Make it really warm. Look, we've got a long journey. Here! Here's the temperature you want! Do these heated seats work in the summer? I won't be cold until we reach Izmir. Hatice, you can adjust the AC as you like. Oh, my God. For God's sake, look at the beautiful view around you. Look how beautiful nature is. Check out this landscape. The trees, the flowers, the insects, the butterflies, the cats… the dog. Dude, the dog! Idiot! You idiot! What are you doing? I wanted to check from here. It might grab my hand if I touch its neck. Get up, idiot, get up! -Is it a Kangal dog, Boran? -It's a Kangal, Zafer. What will you do? Let me die. How did I hit it? Let me die. Don't die, Zafer. The dog hasn't died either. What should we do? Should we move it to the side? What do you mean, move it to the side? Well, boss, I thought maybe it'd regain consciousness on its own. Once it gets over the shock. I swear I'm gonna strangle you, Tekin! I won't show any mercy! I'll strangle you! The dog is fine, but it's having trouble breathing. Bring a blanket from the trunk. Let's take it to a hospital or something. Come on. -Hello? -Ilyas? We had a blind accident. What kind of an accident? That's not important. Take a break somewhere and send us the location. We'll meet you there. Okay. Are you all right? Is something wrong? We're fine, thank God. We're fine. All right, see you. While we were going on vacation! While we were on vacation, you idiots! My hands are still shaking, Tekin. I know what to do with your hands. Kangals are the noblest animals in the world. -And not just because I'm from Sivas. -Drop it! The whole world accepts this as fact. They never bite. They bite into the throats of people they know to be enemies and wait for their owners. They never tear them off until their owners arrive. What if the owner doesn't come, Zafer? If the owner doesn't come, then it's too late for the enemy. Get in the car, man! Get in the car! Zafer, go and get the reflector. Okay, chief. -I won't sit next to it, boss. -What do you mean you won't? One of you has to sit next to it. It's too big. There's no room. It's huge. Both of you, sit in the front seat! Actually, it would have ruined the car, but, thank God, I hit it properly. He hit it properly. Idiot! Pray to God that the animal isn't injured. If it has any broken bones, I'll break your bones. Don't worry. I'm sure it's fine. Tekin, remove your hand. What's with the intimacy? Oh, my God! Run! Brother Zafer! Boss, save me, boss! Boss, save me! Stop, man, or you'll get injured. Oh, my God! It's okay. It'll calm down soon. Stop talking, man! All of this happened because of you! Boss, what will we do now? Go and give its description to the police, if you aren't ashamed to do so. File a complaint, and tell them it bit your butt. -It's calming down. -Oh, it's calming down. It's calming down, chief. The animal is tearing into the car. Boss, it's eating those biscuits by the gearbox. -Apparently, the animal is hungry. -You're the hungry animal! Didn't I tell you not to put those biscuits there, man? Go! A damned dog like this one… Hey! Hey, no! Hey! It's eaten the key. It's eaten the key. It's eaten the key! What did you want with our key, hometown buddy? Come here, man! I swear I'll kill you! There must be a reason. What must have a reason? Everything happens for a reason, Behzat. Even the fact that we are here now has a reason behind it. There's a reason we are here, brother. They had an accident, remember? And we're waiting for them here now. That's what I'm talking about, Ilyas. There's a reason for that too. That's how it is these days. The sun comes up for a reason. The sun comes down for a reason. Yes, sister, yes. It's no lie. -Hatice. -What? Shall we eat stuffed mussels? For God's sake... No, husband, we won't. We've already eaten a lot. We won't eat anything else. Actually, I'll have some, brother-in-law. I love stuffed mussels. That's the way to go. Let me ask them to prepare a hundred stuffed mussels. Whoa! Brother-in-law, whoa! Ömür said she loved them. She didn't say she wanted to die. Okay, Ilyas. I'll ask for 85 then. Eighty-five. Call them and ask them where they are. Don't you have a phone, Behzat? They called you before. That's why I asked you. What would I say to the man who didn't call me? Where are you, Boran? We're coming, Ilyas, we're coming. We'll be there soon. See you. You kept shouting about them, and now we feel like eating some. Thank you, boy. Master, can you open one? Let me know when you go to the vet, Zafer. We'll need to decide whether we stay or not. -Okay, Chief Boran. -See you. Have you ever tasted a stuffed mussel like this one? Don't, brother-in-law! Don't you say anything! Where are Ilyas and the others? May you never find love if you don't eat it. Smart kid. Walk, man! Walk! -Tekin, shall we eat stuffed mussels? -Bon appétit, bro. Okay, Mr. Sabri, thank you. It bit into some hard objects, so let's check its teeth. Doctor, you know best, of course, but can't we remove the key via C-section? First, we'll wait for the dog to digest it naturally. How long do you think that'll take? We've given it the necessary medication. I think it'll be tomorrow. Our Kangal is good, isn't it? It has no dislocated or broken bones. No fractures either. But it has foreign objects in its stomach, so I'm glad you brought it. It turns out my hometown buddy loses control when he is angry. He eats whatever he can find. I'm the same, Doctor. That's how I know. -Doctor, what's your name? -Gamze. Ms. Gamze. Nice to meet you. My name is Zafer. Thank you so much for everything, Ms. Gamze. These animals can't speak their minds. If it weren't for you, who would understand them? I'd like to thank you. There aren't many sensitive people like you. There'll be more of us. There'll be more and more of us. Doctor, if you'll excuse me, I'll stay by his side 24/7. I'll let my friends know, and then I'll be right back. -All right. -My regards, Doctor. Mr. Sadri, I'll be right back. My dear. Tekin… we can't get this key back before morning. Tell the chiefs that the car is damaged. Brother Zafer, that's easy. I'll deal with it. This dog bit me, you know? Do you think I should get a vaccine? What if I've got rabies? Kangals don't have it. Don't worry about it. We're talking about completely different things. Boss. What? Korhan heard that you were in this region. He invited everyone to his place. -Who the hell is Korhan? -What do you mean, "Who's Korhan"? Our Korhan. The boatman, you know? Who is Korhan the boatman, Boran? Well, I don't know either, Tipi. That's why I'm asking him. Who the hell is he, man? Remember the fish restaurant we always go to in Kuzguncuk? Yeah. One night, you got angry with him and told him to get out of your sight. The boy packed his bags and left the city out of respect for you. And? And he moved to a fishing town. And the town he moved to is Erdek. What does this man do for a living here? Chief Behzat, he opened a nice, little boutique hotel. And he has a private bay. He said, "If the chiefs pass by without stopping by my place, I'll be very upset." By the way, Ilyas, I have a very close friend from prison here. I can call him if you like. He'd host us like kings. Don't call anyone. We didn't come here to be a burden to others. We'll check into a hotel until our car has been repaired. He has a private bay, Ilyas. We'd be comfortable, wouldn't we? Well, well. In what way would we be comfortable, Ömür? It's a boutique hotel. I thought you'd be more comfortable in a less crowded place, Behzat. What did I tell you, sister? What did you tell me, brother? Look. It seems like we can enjoy this town for a while. So? Ilyas? I'll call Ayhan. Didn't I just tell you not to call him, brother-in-law? We've come here on vacation! Don't bring along all those men now. Friends from prison, friends from the military service. Besides, we don't know why Korhan was exiled here. That's a different matter. Now that he has invited us… call him and tell him we'll come. Yes, chief. Why did you fire this boatman, Boran? I don't remember, Behzat. But since he listened to me, it means he is a good boy. He fires him, then calls him a good boy. Give me a couple of those, please. I'm starving. Welcome. -Move aside, man! -Boss, welcome. I'm glad you came. You honor me with your visit. Welcome. -Your place looks good, Korhan. -Thanks to you, boss. Tekin? Are we staying in a tent? Tipi, there are excellent bungalows here. Do you have enough space for everyone? Of course. Gosh, check them out. Come, catch your breath first. -Korhan! -Yes, boss. Is that caravan yours? Yes, it's mine. -Can they put my stuff in there? -Of course, boss, yes. Come, catch your breath. Have some coffee. And then you can go to your rooms, eh? Welcome. Welcome. Well done, Korhan. You've opened a good place for yourself. Well, this place is yours. We have a few things missing. We do-- But now that you've graced us with your presence, this place will be heaven. No reception around here? If you walk up towards that hill, you might get some reception. I hope nothing's wrong, Ilyas. Are you expecting a call? No. No, but-- Just in case. Brother, we'll be fine. I don't care if we get no reception. Look how nice and peaceful it is! We've come here on vacation. Let's have some peace. I really like this place. I'm glad we came. Ömür, it's pitch-black. What did you see and like? It's so cute. Look around. It's so romantic. We can go swimming, even at night. Sure. When there's no one else on the beach, after everyone's gone to sleep, you can go swimming with sister Emine, for example. Thanks for giving me permission, Behzat. You're welcome. -Orhan. -Korhan. Korhan! Are there any flies here? Do you have mosquitoes, sand flies, or those ones that go inside you? If there are, I'll take my waistcoat. Well, unless they came here in your car, there are no flies around here. Don't be ridiculous, man! How can flies come in a car? He means there aren't any flies. Okay, okay. Korhan? Can I walk by the tents… to go to the trailer? As you wish, boss. I'll take care of the boss and be right back. Hatice? Shall we chat under the stars on this beach until morning? What would we chat about, husband? We'll shut up and let nature do the talking, Hatice. Well, go ahead and listen to what you like because I'm really tired. Have a good night. -Good night. -See you. Okay, fine. Go to the room. I'll go to the room and we'll chat there. Chief, you're good. You've chosen the most social atmosphere for yourself again. How so? How so? Well, all along you've been saying, "I'm going on vacation, Tekin. I'll find summer love." This place is fitting for new beginnings. Stop talking, man. Boss, Tekin is right. Look how people are socializing. Have a good evening. Okay, drop it. We'll stay for a night. We only have tonight to do it. And then later… Come on, go and get some sleep. Go and get some sleep. Come on. I'm sorry this wasn't quite the vacation I had in mind. I think everything is great. Well, I wish we hadn't brought all these people along with us. Never mind. We'll be alone together for a lifetime anyway. So, you're saying… Are you sure? Why don't you come here? Well, Behzat is there. He must be asleep already. From here? From here like this? What are you doing, Ilyas? What are you doing? Since these houses are wooden, I thought I'd go this way so I wouldn't make any noise when I open the door. You know? So that people wouldn't be disturbed. Some people are disturbed by your voice, not by the noise the door makes. Behzat, why don't you go to sleep? There's a fly. I can't sleep. That Korhan guy said there were no flies. It must have come with you, Behzat. I won't be able to sleep because of this joke, not because of the flies. You're so funny. Thank you, Ilyas. I am. Anyway, you go ahead and talk. Pretend I'm not here. I'm not listening. I love you so much, my love. Whoa! Let's get married as soon as possible and-- I said I wasn't listening, not I couldn't hear. Well, Behzat, I'll make you pay for these things you do when the time comes. I love you very much too, Ömür. Ilyas! What? Anyway… good night, honey. Good night, my love. Ömür? Look at him. For God's sake. Check him out. He looks as if he'll be hit by a torpedo underwater. What I don't get is… how can he swim without sinking? He's wearing a steel vest, after all. Tipi has a stone head, and he doesn't sink despite that, Hatice. What are you talking about? -You're right. -Look at him. Oh, look at him. Brother, it's dripping down on the girl. Take it easy. Okay, sister, I'm turning it. The water was so good, sister. What was it good for, brother? For my soul, sister, for my soul. Is that so? Let us swim and let it be good for our souls, too, then. -Come on, get up, Hatice. -Sit there, sister. What do you mean you'll swim in public? In public? What are you talking about? We're on the beach. The beach. And what is that? It's a place for swimming. Sister, I can't say anything to these two women as they can swim. They're with their husbands. But it wouldn't be appropriate for you to go swimming. Oh, good heavens! Why wouldn't it be appropriate? What will I say to your deceased husband in the afterlife? If he asks, say "My sister was hot, so she went swimming." What else would you say? My husband is coming. What happened, brother-in-law? What happened? What's wrong? I'm sorry for our loss, Hatice. God forbid. Who's died? Yesterday, I told you about my friend from prison, remember? He died. Yesterday, in fact. How did he die? He was waiting for the minibus at the bus stop. The minibus lost control and hit the bus stop, and it ran over everyone there. Oh, no. Was he young? He was a couple of years older than me. It's called a blind accident, husband. I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you, Hatice. It's as if I sensed it. I wish I had called him yesterday. At least I could have gone to his funeral. You know how you always say, "Everything happens for a reason," Tipi? There was a reason for us to come here. Yes, brother-in-law, yes. Everything happens for a reason. Let me dry my vest first. Then we'll go to offer our condolences. Will we go? We will, brother-in-law. I'll speak with Ilyas. We can leave this afternoon. Thank you. What can I do, Tekin? Our Kangal still doesn't feel like visiting the toilet. According to the vet, he may be constipated because of all the things he ate. Lads, don't you have a spare key? Why didn't you have someone send it from Istanbul? Why are you still waiting with your palms open under that dog? Are you an idiot? Boss, we didn't think this incident would drag on for this long. You thought wrong, Tekin. You thought wrong. For God's sake, I'm on vacation. Don't stress me out. We should ask someone to send us a spare key from Istanbul, Zafer. And I'll go and ask Ms. Vet if there is a purgative for animals. Ask away, Zafer. Ask, for God's sake, ask! Where's Korhan? He was with the chiefs. I could ask him to come over. Tell him to come and see if I need anything. Don't worry, I'll tell him to keep his eyes on you. Come on, Tekin, come on. Let me get some. Ilyas? I'll tell you something, but I don't know if everyone will agree. What is it? I'm listening. She said Ilyas. Didn't you hear? She said Ilyas. Tell me, honey. Honey, I really like this place. Can we stay here a few more days? Let's not go anywhere else. It's quiet, calm. It's an extremely boring place. What will we do here? I don't get it. If you are bored, you can go where the noise is. Maybe we'll come and visit you later on. We're good here. Aren't we? Altogether, Ilyas. Wherever we go… we'll go together. Unfortunately. Unfortunately. Ilyas? Where are you? Ilyas? We're going to offer our condolences, Ilyas. Brother-in-law's friend from prison has passed away. We can leave when we return this evening. Okay, bro. We'll be here. You go. Thank you, Ilyas. He was a really close friend. Brother-in-law, I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you. -I'm sorry for your loss. -Thank you. Where's the condolence house? Is it somewhere close by? Seriously… why don't you go with them? Maybe the deceased was also a friend of yours from prison. It'll be good for you too. That's not why I asked. We have an address. We got the address, so we'll ask around and find it. Tekin knows Erdek. He'll take us there. Chiefs, sis, bon appétit. Korhan. Look, Korhan… it's the boss who deserves this vacation the most. You need to make sure that he is comfortable. You should make the necessary arrangements. Be careful, though. Make sure you keep your eyes on him. I don't want any mistakes. Don't worry, Tekin. Good. Let me check on my brother-in-law. Okay, go ahead. Don't worry, I'll be here. -Who are you? -Ms. Gamze is expecting me. -My name is Zafer. -Come in. She's by the pool. Good health to you, Doctor. I hope I'm not disturbing you. Come, Mr. Zafer. -Welcome. -Thank you, Doctor. Would you like a cold drink? A cold drink would be nice, actually. It's so hot. I mean the weather, Doctor. Come this way. -This way. -After you. Any news on our key, Ms. Gamze? Unfortunately, no. Not yet. Okay, there's nothing we can do. What's the rush? Don't you like it here? No, I really like it here. Okay then. I see that you're not really in vacation mode yet. That's why I asked. This is my vacation outfit, Ms. Gamze. I always wear suits. -Classic suits. -Classic suits? Like a businessman. I do business. In this community, they see me as a serious guy. The community? Well, our business concept is quite broad. You know, the community. I can't go into it just yet. Perhaps when we get to know each other better, I'll explain it in more detail. -It's very hot. -I suddenly feel very thirsty. I'd fill the whole pool with ice if I could. That's how much I like the cold. I'll bring a machine for you and fill the whole pool with ice. Thank you. Here you go. I love homemade lemonade. Mojito. Mojito, yes. -It's really good. -I'm glad you like it. The mint gives it a nice flavor. I ate the mint too. Brother-in-law, I turned the AC on. Why are you turning it off? There are three types of friendships that can't be forgotten. Military friendships… prison friendships… and friendships in a foreign place. Exactly, Tipi, exactly. He was my bunkmate. You know what that means. The poor man's kids were little back then. He'd go under the duvet at night and cry in secret. My kids were little too. And I'd always cry whenever he cried. Longing for something is difficult. It makes a man cry in secret. So, where's this street? It must be around here but… -What was the name of the street? -Sumbul. Tekin, don't just drive around. Ask them. Right away, Tipi. Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you. -And upon you too. We're looking for Sumbul Street. It must be around here somewhere. -Are you here to offer your condolences? -Yes, brother. Go down that street, and it's on the right, after 300 meters. Thank you, brother. Close these windows. -It's draughty in here. -Okay. Amen. -So tragic... -Uh-huh. I'm sorry for your loss, brother. I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sorry for your loss. You came from Istanbul? Yes, Istanbul. -Istanbul. -Yes, from Istanbul. Did you know the deceased? We slept together for four years. We really loved each other. I don't get it. The deceased… may he rest in peace. He'd always sleep on top of me. Did you hear that, man? We listened to the story of their friendship on our way here. The days, the nights they spent together… until the break of dawn. Crying… and making each other cry. Oh, I wish those nights could speak. Under the duvet… every night, until morning-- What the hell are you saying about my mother? Police! Break it up! -Give me my fork! -Walk! Korhan, come here. Yes, boss? Is the back side of this beach also yours? No, boss. I really wanted it, but there's this guy who's trouble. -I couldn't buy it. -Who the hell is he? You're on vacation. I don't want to ruin your fun. I agree. Brother Korhan, it's a very nice place. If you had bought it, this place would be even bigger. It's no good this way. It's hard. He called the man trouble, Behzat. Didn't you hear him? Ilyas, I don't mind if we're surrounded by trouble. We're just idly sitting here. I'll die of boredom. Let's go and resolve this. Friends, I'm sorry. I won't go from here to there. I'm here on vacation. I'm gonna have fun. No. There's no need, really. The man is a druggie. Don't bother with him. What did you say? A druggie? Well, whatever. Never mind, guys. What is it to us? Apparently, the man is having his own fun. Chief Ilyas, it'd be fine if he was just having his own fun. But he's poisoning young people. -What do you mean by that? -He sells pills. So, he's not a user, he's a seller. Who is it? Who the hell is this jerk? Husnu the Gorilla. Is that so? I'm terrified of gorillas. I don't care about your gorilla. Friends, don't spoil your fun. We'll send Tekin. He can go and deal with it. We'll buy the beach and give it to Korhan as a gift. Thank you, boss. Am I wrong? I suddenly feel hot all over. I'm going for a swim. -Anyone want to come? -Yes. Brother Korhan, come, sit down. Yes, chief. This monkey called Husnu. Tell me, where is he based? There's an amusement park back there. -An amusement park? -Yes, he sells them there. The amusement park, eh? Well, they make kids and then release them in public. Ömür, swim ahead so that your fiancé can come to you. So that you can be alone together in the sea. Shall I pretend I'm drowning too, sister? Oh, come on. Take a look around. Is there anyone who'd appreciate a joke here? Move aside. What are you doing? I almost killed you. What are you doing? Why were you sneaking behind me like that? I didn't even see you. Sorry then. It's been an unfortunate clash. Are you staying here? Yes, and you? We're staying in a tent. I'm staying in the caravan. Nice to meet you. We haven't met yet. You're right. I'm Boran. And I'm Sibel. Thank you. Well… can I treat you to a cup of coffee? To make amends? Okay. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a man who likes violence. I'm against violence. I was about to drown you. I was really scared. Otherwise, I don't like violence. It's fine. There's love in Erdek, my dear, my dear Sibel is my one and only And I'm Sibel's one and only I'd go to hell for you, for you Life goes on nicely There's love in Erdek, my dear, my dear Sibel. Sibel is my one and only And I'm Sibel's one and only I'd go to hell for you Did you see that? They don't tell us that they're going or come back from wherever they are. It's so nice, Hatice. We got to relax for a while. Actually, I hope they don't come back tonight. It's great like this. Hatice, it's not like you don't know your husband. I bet he went there and shared all his memories with them. May he rest in peace, but now that the man is dead, there is no one to confirm what he says or contradict him. Make him stop, if you can. I don't understand why Tekin left Boran and went there. Apparently, Boran sent him himself. Because he's in vacation mode. Come on, Ilyas. What? Where? We need to go somewhere. We're eating. Can't you see that, Behzat? Was I talking to you, Ömür? Just stay there and eat your food. Where are we going? -To the monkey. -What? The monkey? The amusement park. What will you do at the amusement park, Behzat? It's not like Ilyas and I are going there to drive bumper cars. We've got something to do. Behzat… Boran told us to let Tekin deal with it. Brother, look… we're in a vacation spot. Don't bring trouble on us, please. Look, everything's great. We're having fun. Behzat? Come join us. Sister, we're not bringing trouble or anything. I'm just feeling a bit bored, and Ilyas will keep me company. What's more appropriate? Ilyas keeping you company or staying here with me? She's right. You can do that later. God, grant me patience. Okay, Behzat, let's go wherever you want. Ilyas? I wonder if we should go to the amusement park as well. There's no reception here. We can call my husband and ask them where they are. No. We'll-- We'll call them, and we'll let you know when we come back. Come on. Come on, man. Look at them. I don't want to go to heaven if they'll be there. Let them go wherever they wanna go. We'll go on our own. We don't need their permission. Go where? To the amusement park. Should we ask Boran to join us? Leave people alone when they're on vacation. Let everyone do their own thing. Look at those waves. I plunge into the blue. I haven't been able to go swimming for days because of those waves. I'm good at diving. Well, I'm a diver. That's what I meant. I've brought up so many things from the depths of the sea. You'd lose your mind if you saw them. Your eyes would be like a Pokémon's. Let's go diving tomorrow then. Actually, I'm really good at night diving. I've never dived at night. But I really love to swim. Come on. Now? What are you waiting for? Come on. Take two towels to Chief Boran right away. Towels, boy, towels. Hurry up! And bring me a cup of coffee. Hello, sister. I hope nothing's wrong. Where are you going? We're going for a walk. What are you doing here? Tekin is not here, so I'm hanging around in case they need something. Good. Do what you will. Is he crazy or what? For some reason, he keeps staring at people. Boy, where's the towel? The man will be cold! Come on, quickly! Run! Their phones are switched off. I also called Zafer, but he didn't answer. What will you do? Will you ask for backup to set a monkey straight? Don't be ridiculous. As everyone knows, I hate it when people don't answer my calls. Anyway, is there anyone here who knows Husnu the Gorilla? No. They act like they don't know him. Look at this amusement park. What kind of a park is this? It's obvious that something else is going on here. They can't even pay the electricity bill with these customers. So? So we're in the right place. Don't worry, I'll find that monkey. Brother, look here. What is it? There's someone here called Husnu the Gorilla. Do you know him? -I don't. -What do you mean you don't? Why the hell are you here then? Brother, walk away. Calm down. You can't talk to me like that! Drop it, he doesn't know him. We'll ask someone else. Why are you so uneasy? Let's go over there. We'll buy something and ask in an appropriate manner. Ilyas, what are we gonna buy? Cotton candy? Do you like corn? I love it. -Hello. -Welcome. Give my friend a cob of corn. Of course. My sweet corn tastes great. Should I add any salt? Never mind the salt. There's this guy, Husnu the Gorilla. Do you know him? I don't know anyone by that name. Here's what we'll do. If you're afraid it'll cause you some trouble, take this. Tell me where the man is, and let us do our thing. Who are you? Are you cops? Would the cops pay 200 lira for sweet corn? Don't be a fool. Answer me. Won't you buy some sweet corn for us, Ilyas? Oh, God. What are you doing here? This has nothing to do with you. We came here to have some fun. We're going to have sweet corn, ice cream… Whatever we like. We'll go for a ride on the Ferris wheel. What's it to you? Come. I'll tell you something. Is this okay now, Ilyas? You promised you wouldn't get involved in anything during our vacation. Ömür, don't you see? Can your brother not get involved in something? He can't. This has nothing to do with me. Where's my husband? I wonder what he's gotten involved in. Their phones are still switched off. I'll ask him to account for it later on. There are things you don't know here. Eat your sweet corn, and take a ride on your Ferris wheel. We'll be back before the ride is over. Behzat. Come on. They have something to do. -Let's walk around. -Where to, sister? Let's watch the view from the top. Come on. Let me tell you something. Will you answer, or shall I stick your head in the cauldron? What? We heard you were asking about Husnu. It's true, we were. Ask him to come over. He's waiting for you. Okay. That's fine too. Look at them. They are in trouble again. May God sort you out. I've never been on a Ferris Wheel before. There won't be any problems, right? Hatice, are you afraid of heights? I'm not, but… what if it stops while we're up here or breaks down? I wouldn't want to be stuck here. If it stops, help will come, Hatice. You're freezing. Let's go to the caravan. Okay. Oh boy, Korhan… consider the next bay yours now. I didn't know you had so many hidden talents. I've never had a massage like this, not even in the Philippines. What the hell is going on? What's going on? Are you okay? Shall I keep going? I'm okay. Keep going. Turns out I've got a knot there. You say keep going, but… don't I deserve a massage too? Oh, if you knew the things you deserve. What do I deserve? -Pervert! -What? -There's a pervert! -Hey! Hey! There's a pervert! There's a pervert! Get up! There's a pervert! There's a pervert! Get up, man! There's a pervert! They've invaded your village! There's a pervert! Run! Get up and help me, friends! There's a pervert! Get up, there's a pervert! A pervert has invaded your village! Are you idiots? Why are you laughing at me? Oh, no. It's not like that. Ilyas! Ilyas! Ilyas! Hello, police? Please hurry. There's a lynching attempt on our beach. I think I'm gonna throw up. Please, let's get off, Emine. I promised Ilyas. Okay, let's go for one more ride. If they don't show up, we'll get off and go back to the hotel. What if something has happened to them? What could have happened to them, Ömür? Who would get involved with those two maniacs? You were asking about me, gentlemen? I'm listening. Go ahead. Now, Husnu… we heard something. So we thought we'd come here and ask you in person. Husnu? Yes, Husnu. Isn't your name Husnu? Why are you so surprised? They called you Husnu the Gorilla. Correct. My name is Husnu. They call me Husnu the Gorilla because I've crushed many men like you. So, tell us. Who are you? I'll tell you. I'm Ilyas Çakirbeyli. And I'm Behzat Façali. I didn't catch that. Say it again. Are you deaf? Ilyas Çakirbeyli and Behzat Façali. Did you hear that, man? They're called Ilyas and Behzat. What's so funny about that? What's so funny? You punks have come before me, and you tell me your names are Ilyas and Behzat. If you want to pretend to be someone else and come here to put on a show, you really need to do your research first. Ilyas and Behzat are enemies, they're enemies. If you'd spent two days in our universe, you would know this. Maybe… they made peace. Let's imagine that they made peace. Those men, the real Ilyas and Behzat, would buy all of Erdek if they wanted to. What would they do with this small place? Maybe they came to look for you, Husnu. Let's assume that they wanted to come here. They would have called me first. But you fools don't know that… Ilyas and Behzat are friends of mine. You're messing with the wrong person. You know him? So, you know Ilyas… and Behzat, huh? Guys? Shall I punish them myself, or shall I let Ilyas and Behzat know so that they can do what's necessary? Excellent idea. Call him. You have Ilyas Çakirbeyli's number, so just call him. Give me my phone. He's called me before. I saved his phone number. Don't blame me. I was going to let you go, but Ilyas won't let you live. Let me tell you that. Whose phone is ringing? Put it on silent. We're trying to talk here. Husnu? Husnu the Gorilla. I am Ilyas Çakirbeyli, Husnu. I'm sitting across from you. Was that a gunshot? Where did it come from? -Come on! We're going in. -Understood. POLICE What did you do, Behzat? What did you do? Wait. I'm not done with you yet. Get down! Who gave you my number? Get down! Leave him alone! Who did you get my number from? Okay, guys. We came here to teach these drug dealers a lesson. Don't get us wrong. The corn vendor! Why didn't you tell us you were a cop? You ruined the entire operation! I'll see you. I'll see you. What's going on? They're taking our guys away. -Ilyas-- -Shut up! They'll hear us and take us away too. That guy broke a chair over my head. Look, I'm telling you both. No one will know what happened. What do you mean "no one," Tipi? Not even your wife or brother-in-law. Or Ilyas. I'm telling you. Not even Boran. No one. Of course, Tipi. It's too embarrassing. If the boss saw the state of us right now, he'd never look at my face again. Are you crazy? Do I look like a pervert to you? I am a handsome man. I swear, it was my first night with Sibel. I was chasing the pervert away. Tekin? Boss? Man, I'm gonna knock-- Let go of me. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Move aside, move. What's going on, Boran? What happened to you? Actually, let me ask you, Tipi. What happened to you? Don't ask what's happened to us, Boran. I'm asking you. What are you doing here? Actually, when we look at the state you're in, our situation doesn't seem so bad. So, it's okay to tell you. Don't act so mysterious, man! My situation is completely down to a misunderstanding, so it's nothing. That's exactly what happened to us, believe me. I mean, except for that outfit, of course. Boran, look… there are four of us in here. You're in a disgraceful situation, and so are we. This will all stay between us. Mine is no big deal. It was a tiny misunderstanding, that's all. But I'm gonna kill that Korhan guy who Tekin sent after me once I get out of here, or my name isn't Boran. That little prick! I warned him 50 times. I told him to keep an eye on you at all times. Did he do something wrong? That peeping Tom kept his eye on me at all times, all right. Yes, Tekin, I'm listening to you. Tell me what scandal brought you here, but keep it short. I'll tell you right now, boss. Well, long story short… we offered our condolences at the wrong house. How? Well, the house we went to was also a condolence house, but it was for a woman. My friend died in the same accident. What does it matter what their gender was? All you had to do was go there, recite some prayers and leave. It was supposed to be exactly like that. But when he started sharing his memories of the deceased, talking about their ups and downs, their memories under the duvet and on their beds, all hell broke loose. How can I not tell Ilyas about this? Don't, Boran. These things can't be told to others. We'd be ashamed to go out in public. Shut up, you piece of trash. You'll meet a bad end anyway. You've ruined everyone's lives. You're the head of the snake! I don't understand why you're exaggerating this matter. We're only human. It could happen to anyone. You can't explain it like that! Is this something that could happen to us? We have a name to uphold. We have a reputation. Anyway… this Korhan prick will surely come to get us out, right? Of course, boss. I'm sure Korhan has already caused quite a stir. Yes, he has. Ilyas and Behzat are coming. Welcome, Ilyas. Thank God. Get us out of here. I'll tell you what happened later. What are you doing here? Oh, the things that have happened, Ilyas. Come on. Why are you pushing me? Am I a pervert? What are you doing here? I'll break the heart of anyone who utters a word. Oh, really, Mr. Behzat? We're so scared that our hearts will be broken. Pilgrim, may God accept it. Why are you dressed like that? Ilyas… let me tell you right now before somebody else does. We… went to the wrong house. And very unpleasant things happened there. What the hell does that mean? What kind of wrong house was it? No, it's not what you think, brother-in-law. We did go to a condolence house… but it turned out to be for a woman. And Boran was arrested… for being a pervert. What are you talking about, Tipi? No such thing happened. I swear! Okay, but… why are you here, Ilyas? Tell us. Maybe they were victims of a misunderstanding as well. There was no misunderstanding. We went to teach a drug dealer a lesson, but what we didn't know was that the anti-narcotics team was holding an operation there at the same time. So, this is it. What else could it be? Tekin, exercise our right to a phone call. Call Zafer. Let that idiot come and get us out of here. He isn't answering. I've been calling him since morning. I don't know what's keeping him busy, but he won't answer my calls. He was at the vet's. Let me call Zafer. Brother, listen. We want to exercise our right to make a phone call. -Who will you call? -Zafer. Yes, I'll call Zafer. Zafer has come. We're saved! How did you guys end up here? It's a long story. Brother, stop pushing me around! Okay. -I'm not saying anything. You're a cop. -Come here. Where the hell have you been? It doesn't matter how we ended up in here. What happened to you? And your face? I almost died. I wish you had died! I wish you had, Zafer. You know what I'm gonna do to you when we get out of here? You can kill me, but hear me out first. What happened to me has never happened to anyone. Oh, really? Chief Boran? No, I'm Aristotle. Idiot! Where were you? Where were you? Why didn't you answer my calls, Zafer? Can I explain myself? I don't want to understand or listen to what you went through. Wait a second, Ilyas. Everyone here is curious. Maybe it's something that concerns us. Tell us, Zafer. Don't get us involved in your gossip, brother-in-law. Just a second. So, what happened? Did a dog tear you to pieces? Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened. While Ms. Vet and I were trying to get the key out of the dog, I had an interference from behind. What kind of interference? I hope you didn't harm the animal, Zafer. No, no such thing happened. Stop digressing, Zafer. Just tell us what happened. Look, everyone's thinking different things. -Let me tell you. -Go there. Now, chiefs… Ms. Gamze, the vet, and I were waiting for the dog to pass it out. Pass what out? The key, chief. In the meantime, we grew intimate. -With whom? -With Ms. Gamze, the vet. Ms. Gamze said, "Please stay for dinner." -To you? -Yes, to me. For dinner? Yes, for dinner, chief. Ms. Vet turned out to be a real animal lover. She really is, chief. I walked into her house and… there were candles, candle holders. I jumped over the candles. The table was covered with food. I don't even know the names of the exotic fruits that were on that table. Thank God, I saw some plums. I dipped the plums in salt… and ate them. I said, "I need to go. The chiefs will be worried." "Ms. Gamze, Ms. Vet." But no matter how much I begged… There's some distance between us, Mr. Zafer. Then let's get closer, Ms. Gamze. I found myself in the bedroom. You're lying! Ms. Gamze took off my shirt with a sleight of hand. She pulled me closer to kiss her. I ended up on top of her. And then someone bothered me from behind! For God's sake! What does that mean? Someone bothered you from behind? Mr. Sabri? Who's Mr. Sabri? Chief, it was licking my ear. Its hot breath was on my neck. I turned around to look, and it was our Kangal. If I had pushed him away, he would have bitten my ear or my head. So I had to… bite that animal. You bit the dog? So, that was the situation. Amazing. I wish it hadn't left its job unfinished. So they put you in here because that animal attacked you? Like you said, Behzat, Ms. Gamze turned out to be a real animal lover. I bit that dog, and she reported me to the police. And here I am. Zafer, what happened to our key? I filed a complaint about that with our officer friends. They'll bring the key to us, Tekin. All right, gentlemen… all of us somehow ended up in a bad situation. My only consolation is that my sisters… they neither witnessed nor got involved in this situation or in our scandals. That is my only consolation. I'm speaking for myself, of course. Ilyas, they must have gotten back from the amusement park, right? The amusement park was shut down. What would they do at a closed amusement park? You took my Hatice to the amusement park? Thank you so much. At least she got to enjoy her vacation. God knows what she's doing right now. Stop talking about opening fire in a public area. Don't you understand? We didn't shoot at anyone. We fired into the air a couple of times so that they'd see us and rescue us. Your testimonies will be taken later. Please don't give us a hard time. -What's going on, sister? -Look who's talking! Drop the silly questions. What are you doing here? Look at them. Schmucks. You were the ones who threw us in here. What do you mean? We're here because of you! Move aside, leave me. Hatice, you look beautiful. Oh, he's still talking. Ömür? Are you okay? I'm fantastic, Behzat. Thanks to you, I'm very good. I'd also like to thank you for abandoning us there. We didn't abandon you, Ömür. We were taken. Exactly. Unfortunately… Ilyas is right. -God, grant me patience. -What? -Hatice. -What? What is it? Oh, the things we've been through. I don't want to know. Do you understand? -I'm not asking either. -So, should I not tell you? He's still talking. Sister, anyway, what's done is done. Apparently, there is a reason for everything that has happened. A reason? Here's your reason! Come on, find a reason for this too! I'll do the same thing. Boss, I guess Korhan sorted things out. -Are we being released? -I guess so. Have the women left? -What's going on? -You're going for identification. What identification are you talking about? What we are, who we are, that's obvious. Why bother looking at us? Give me my shoe, Tipi. No, I won't, sister. You'll throw it at me again. -There you go. -What are you doing? Take that one too! He won't give it to me. Find a reason for that too! I'll do the same to you. I'm coming. Can they see us when you switch the light on? Yes. Could you turn it on? You asked me to come down here in vain. These aren't my friends… or relatives. I don't know any one of them. THE END
