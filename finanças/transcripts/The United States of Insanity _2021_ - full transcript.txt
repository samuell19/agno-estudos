This morning, the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Justice and against the FBI, challenging the designation of a musical fan base as a criminal gang. It is a quintessential civil liberties case, challenging government abuse and supporting the right of people to express themselves without fear of police persecution. Recognizing the absurdity of the situation and that there are civil liberties and constitutional issues involved that extend far beyond this issue. I'd like to introduce the plaintiffs.

I'm Violent J from Insane Clown Posse. Joe Bruce, my real name. I'm Shaggy 2 Dope. AKA Joseph Utsler, my government name. And I am an entertainer extraordinaire. I'm a rapper. A musician. Artist. Actor. Wrestler. Pro wrestler. Father of three, married. I'm a Bruce brother. I'm an honorary Bruce brother, I think. - He's the third Bruce brother. It goes way back to when we were children. Yeah. We're sitting here with two big stars. Insane Clown Posse. Let's take a phone call. You guys are fucking horrible. Let's have a serious conversation. When are you guys gonna fucking kill yourselves? We've made USA Today's worst album of the year, like twice. We made GQ's worst artists of all time. Page after page after page. This is the worst music you've ever heard. What is this shit? What is this garbage? Just totally dissing. We used to just look and look and look for one positive review. Couldn't find it. ♪ Water, fire, air and dirt ♪ ♪ Fucking magnets, how do they work ♪ What the hell was that? Yeah, even clowns think they suck. People hate what they don't understand. And there's a lot to not understand about ICP, you know? Just the face paint alone. Alternative music didn't want nothing to do with us. Hip hop didn't want nothing to do with it. Without a home, a home began to form itself and began to dig its own niche out in society. Explaining Juggalos is such a hard thing. You probably maybe come from a broken home and you dealing with with depression. You know what I mean? Probably dealing with depression like we do. Trouble, you know, trouble in their life. Stuff like that, you know? I think that's why it's such a good clique, such a good thing because we're Juggalos ourself, you know? What does it mean to be a Juggalo? Most people say family. You're just walking around with your shirt or your charm or something. And you see someone else and boom, you've just made a new friend. Like the family thing is really real. We all have each other's back, it's nuts. You're making it sound like the Manson family, bro. Being yourself. Being who the fuck you are and not giving a fuck what anyone thinks. If it hurts your feelings, I'm sorry that your parents raised a pussy. We exist because other people judged us and kind of made us outcasts. We all band together under that. I've been a Juggalo since I came out of my mom's vagina. ♪ What is a Juggalo? ♪ We embrace the hate now because what are we going to do, fight it? It just made us cooler to the Juggalos, man. That's what's going on in the outside world. Inside with the Juggalos, it was a party. We were getting massive love. - Clown love, baby! - Clown love! Clown love! Dude, it was off the hook. It was so fucking fresh. That's what we're hearing every day. Meanwhile, we pick up a paper that talks about who could listen to this garbage. Which one do we believe? We just went with the fam. ♪ What is a Juggalo ♪ My husband has been serving a life sentence since he was 19. So I got his mugshot. Hi. Hey. This is John. He's been a Juggalo since he was nine years old. Oh he's on the phone? Yeah. What up, man? What's up, man. Shit, just out here baking our ass off. What's good with you, man? I love you guys. You guys have got me through so many dark times in my life. You don't even know. Are you locked up? For life. Oh shit, for life? Yeah, there's thousands of Juggalos in prison too, bumping your shit. Well maybe you guys could start up a Juggalo gang in there, man. And kick some ass. Or perhaps not. Baby. Want us to sign the face? Yeah. They're signing your face, baby. I'm gonna do another tattoo. He's giving you another tattoo on your forehead. That's crazy. We have this beautiful relationship with these people and we fucking love the Juggalos, man. They want our music as a soundtrack to their life. So why not provide? Music fans or gang members? The government says they're dangerous. These 142 pages document cases of brutal murders, assaults across the country. They all have one word in common. Juggalo. A Juggalo is a follower of a rap group called the Insane Clown Posse, known for its violent lyrics. There's about a million fans and a percentage may be involved in crime. The FBI has classified Juggalos as a gang. Juggalos say they're a family. Family, family, family, family! ♪ And I'd walk home feeling like a samurai ♪ ♪ I'd walk in the house and see my mama cry ♪ ♪ I'd ask why, she points to my drunk pops ♪ ♪ He tried to hit her again, but that shit stops ♪ ♪ I kick him in his throat, you hear his neck break ♪ We both come from poor, broken families, broken homes. Our real dad bailed when I was two. We had to go through his replacement, which was even worse. The older I get, the more I realize how fucked up my childhood was, but I definitely think it helped made us stronger people. You know what I'm saying? And I think it made us 10 billion times more hungry when we starting out. Not having nothing when you grow up, that'll shape you for the rest of your fucking life, whether you got money or not. Yes, throughout the whole house, isn't it, hun? The nautical theme. My name is Linda and I'm Violent J's mother, Joe Bruce. And I'm a Juggalette. I think I was probably the first one. You were the first one, ma. I was 19 years old when I had my first baby. That was Teresa. And then I had Rob and then Joe's my baby, the caboose. We struggled. We were poor, but we never went to bed hungry or anything like that. But there wasn't a lot of money for entertainment. But as a mother, you always try. We were the poorest in the neighborhood. We got the food stamps and all that. But our imaginations were there. Big time imaginations, you know what I'm saying? We had a club name. We called ourselves The Floobs. First thing we did was make having nothing cool. It's okay to have mismatched shoes. We had these rickety old bikes and kids would make fun of us. They were riding around with Mongooses and Supergooses. We'd have fucked up bikes. They were pieced together from like nine other bikes. And we made it cool. We were like, that's the Floobmobile. We turned it around and we really did feel like we were the shit. Cause we were part of the Floobs. We didn't feel left out cause we were with each other. Like them fucking trench coat mafia kids from the fucking Columbine or whatever. They're all crying about they didn't have no friends, whatever. There was two of those motherfuckers, you know what I'm saying? They have friends, they had each other, you know? They have a lot of self-worth together. Even maybe separately they don't, but together they do. Joe had a fire, is the only thing I can call it. When he wanted to do something, you couldn't deny it. He just had to, he had to do it. We always been the type of kids that do whatever we were into, you know, we have to do it. - And then he started going really interested in wrestling. I remember driving him to Joe Louis Arena. I didn't have the money. And I knew that if I didn't take him, he would've walked. I must've been 15 years old, maybe 14 years old. Out back is where we all would get our autographs from all the wrestlers coming out. And all of a sudden, I see these two guys wrestling, these two young kids. And I'm like, holy shit, man. They do it better than the guys inside. I remember coming home from work and there'd be footprints on my ceiling. And I was trying to figure out how that happened. They would super suplex each other in the living room. He'd be flipping them and the guy would actually walk on the ceiling. They were in junior high school and they started their own wrestling league, National Allstar Wrestling. We had a ring built in his mom's backyard. Built out of railroad logs. We'd wait till it would rain and we'd be out there in the rain pounding it in the ground because the ground would be softer. And then we use garden hose to wrap around the railroad rails. And we'd sell it to the fullest. To the kids in the neighborhood. We ran it like a real wrestling organization. We would advertise. Flyer the neighborhood. Flyer through the neighborhood, house to house. Come see N.A.W. kids wrestling. We weren't waiting till we grew up to wrestle. We were like, we're bringing wrestling to us. I got to make the hot dogs. I had the hot dogs going and chips. It had free lunch. When you came, you got a hot dog and a bag of chips. But they did it all themselves. I don't know where a lot of that talent came from, but there was something going on all the time. When they started going to high school, it was really hard. Cause all of a sudden you don't know where they are or who their friends are or what they're doing. ♪ You ask do we gangbang ♪ ♪ Do we bang in a gang, mang ♪ ♪ Do we bang bang ♪ ♪ I'm a gang banger, man ♪ ♪ I bang in a gang, mang ♪ ♪ You can suck my Wang, mang ♪ ♪ Richie-boy, bitchy-boy ♪ ♪ It's a Southwest thing ♪ That's the first titty bar I ever went to when I was 15. Oh, that's the Atlantis? No, no. Atlantis I went to when I was 14. I put on a fake mustache. I could show you the greatest place to hide a dead body too. - The Floobs ended up being eventually the Inner City Posse, which was their own gang. We were gonna be some bad asses. We were forming our own thing. Even though, the fact of the matter is, we didn't know shit. We were like gang-wannabe. We started tagging ICP all over the neighborhood. With rhinestone ICP hats on. We were crazy for doing what we were doing because these were real gangs here. And we learned how to get our ass kicked too. Yeah I learned how to take a good beating. So we were walking past these gang members sitting on a porch and they were just giving us this mean eye. So, boom, we just march on through, man. Like we're the Warriors. Here we go, man. And we give them these mean mugs. There must've been, I don't know, 20 of them at the time. And I was like, fuck man, here we go. Somebody says something. I say, fuck you. And fuck all you guys. And we. All of a sudden, man, the gang squad. God couldn't have timed it better for us to save our lives. The gang squad pulls up and Joe and I start walking. We start walking and these guys are booking all around me, surrounded them. And we're just like, ah, ha ha ha. So they get them. We're at the corner. Fuck, look at us. You fucking asshole. And fuck you. We were a fucking miniature gang. And so when this FBI gang thing happened 25 years later, we thought it was funny. We laughed. We were like, dang we're gang-bangers. Oh yeah, yeah, Haha. Officially. Dopeness. They're saying Juggalos are one of the 10 most notorious real gangs. So look at that company right there. Bloods, Crips and MS-13 is like, yeah, I'm in a gang. ♪ Straight outta Compton ♪ ♪ Here's a crazy brother named Ice Cube ♪ Here they are, man. Greatest of all time, the Beatles of rap. The stuff that I was like, I can't believe what they're saying. Is that real, you know? That's the shit I love man. The stuff that scared me. When I was a kid, I had that poster in my bedroom. Vanessa Williams. Look at at how fine she is, bro. Fifteen years old, this was on my wall. And I don't know how many times I nutted to it. She ain't even naked. My mom was a hippie. So of course she had the White Album, that creepy-ass Queen record. Everything from that, the Blues Brothers. There was always music in my house. Third, fourth grade or whatever. That's when rap started catching on a little bit. Learned how to start scratching, deejaying. Herbie Hancock, he was the first one to commercially put a scratch on record. And that was actually the first scratch I ever learned how to do. Endless Michael Jackson. I can't even find a bootleg, a piece of video footage or a song of Michael Jackson's that I don't already know. ♪ Went R&B top ten hit ♪ ♪ And we had T-Pain singing all of our own shit ♪ ♪ Fuck that, though, yo, I'm a Juggalo ♪ ♪ I'm a Jugga-lugga-lo fo' sho' ♪ Michael Jackson is without a doubt the biggest influence. You know you really gotta dig somebody to get a tattoo of them, you know what I'm saying? Oh! You take Michael Jackson, mix him with NWA and throw some Pearl Jam in there. And somehow out of that weird concoction is the Insane Clown Posse. I mean, can't you tell, listening to ICP? We're huge Michael Jackson fans. Look at this horrible picture they used. He looks like the fuckin' Toxic Avenger. ♪ Drop the motherfuckers all the way to Delray ♪ When we started rapping, when we were kids, this was gang ridden territory. That's what we'd rap about. And all of our friends were like, yeah, you know what I mean? Make more shit about Southwest. I was working at a gas station. He was working at a Coney island. Every single fuckin' dime went right into the pot. My girlfriend's paycheck went right into the pot. That was plenty to get us started. We recorded our first EP. And we were gangsters. We were doing the gangster rap. ♪ Violent J servin' ghetto hard street shit ♪ ♪ You know it's potent when the funky-ass beat hit ♪ ♪ Rolling the dice and we's hittin' point ♪ ♪ ICP! ♪ ♪ Out of Southwest Detroit ♪ ♪ Running with a gang of twenty street hoods ♪ We had our EP, Dog Beats, in every record store, everywhere. We were given a mission from God. - They're not going to catch us, we're on a mission from God. Went to every record store we could find in the phone book. We used to go way out in the middle of nowhere and steal the phone books from the Denny's. Just so you can look up record stores. Lot of people would put them in their neighborhood and that was it. These aspiring rappers, they sucked. They had no heart, man, no fuckin' drive. ♪ Inner City Posse's got the Dog Beats ♪ ♪ ICP we got the Dog Beats ♪ With Dog Beats, everywhere the car could drive, we had it on consignment. So many other local bands in Detroit at the time would lie to us. They would say, "How many have you guys sold?" And we'd say, oh man, "2,800". And they would say, "Oh, you guys got a ways to go, man. We're at like 8,000." And then we would be like, how? How? How are they doing it, you know? They were lying. But come to know later they were lying, but we would all of a sudden have to meet 8,000. So we would just go home and... Must work harder. Must work harder. All work. No time for pleasure. No playing, no time for pleasure. ♪ Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay ♪ Everywhere, flyers. 24 hours at Kinko's all the time. Our Kinko's hustle was pretty immaculate, man. They had these little blue keys and it was a copy counter. They had a resetter right by the counter. So we're like, yo we're fucking stealing one of those. Put like a 105 on the key, but we really were off like 2,000. It was never hot chicks up in there, but you know, somebody would be banging a broad, you know what I'm saying? To get free color copies in the back. Kinkos. Your branch shop is 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I remember one particular evening before they went on stage. Joe came along with some clown wigs from Halloween. I was like, this is not gonna work. My boys are rapping about breaking into cars, beating up guys, stealing, fucking chicks. And then here you come out with a clown wig, you know, on stage. And I remember the reaction of the other artists backstage. They're like, "The fuck are these guys doing?" It's fun to paint your face and hide behind that. I can fuck up now, I'm a clown. You already expect me to do something stupid. Cause I had clown paint on. There's something refreshing about that. And then the word got around about these clowns. These clowns, man, with the wigs. These guys were stealing shows. They were coming in, doing the fucking deal and then leaving. And everybody was leaving with them. ♪ Hey, Faygo, say, Faygo, ♪ ♪ What a way to go, Faygo ♪ ♪ That precious sauce, Juggalo Juice ♪ ♪ Crack that fat boy, let it go loose ♪ Run-DMC had Adidas and the Beastie Boys had White Castle hamburgers. - Let me get 800 cheeseburgers.

Kids fuckin' loved that they were there. We love fuckin' doing it. We just did it more and more. That's who we were. We always had a two liter, you know. What the fuck, man? We used to pass fuckin' two liters like they were 40s. Straight up. And now I remember this clearly. I remember Joe saying Insane Clown Posse.

Who wants to go get a fuckin' real job now? - We thought we were rich, man. - We were fuckin' getting paid. We were driving new cars because, well we drove one new car and that was for times we needed to look impressive. We had a Suzuki Sidekick that way when we pulled up to the in stores, you know, we were fresh. This right here behind us is St. Andrews Hall. Hey, who's playing here tonight? Who?

To me, I just couldn't believe it. I couldn't say, "get a real job" anymore. I wanted them to have the Bruce Brothers Hobby Shop. I keep asking, "is that going to happen?" And they said, "Well, maybe someday it might happen." We had this wonderful thing going on. We're making money at it. We're making a living. We're able to raise our kids. As far as albums we've sold, if you combine them all, I think it's something around 10 million. It might be as much as 14 million. Thirty years later, we're still working. Just like we always have. We still put out records, we still tour. We still move merchandise all over the world. You can't download a t-shirt. You can't download a pair of thongs. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why we're still in business and why this act became real. Because it's destiny, man, it's our destiny. Psychopathic records presents the infamous, world famous Gathering of the Juggalos. And this year's four day long outdoor music festival of freshness, flavor and motherfucking freedom. Fuck work. Tell them your Juggalo homies said they can eat a dick up till they hiccup. The Gathering is a family reunion for Juggalos. A weekend of pure bliss, fun and nonstop flavor. Where did you get that? Get what? Get dick in your mouth! The reason why The Gathering is so important is because that is the one week out of the year where a Juggalo, who is probably ostracized in his or her community, can unite with people who are just like them. We're here this weekend to fucking rage and party and then clean up after ourselves. It draws between five and 10,000 people every year. Juggalos that come to the gathering, they're the most diehard Juggalos that there are. It took me 36 hours to get here. - Traveling for about 55 hours. Dude, I quit both my jobs to be here. I'm out on bond right now. I'm not even supposed to be here, real talk. I think if I died, my soul would've made the journey. I'd still be here. You guys go to The Gathering? Ah hell no, man. I heard them Juggalos are like gang members and shit. They crazy! Yeah we don't associate with that shit. These guys will always be outcasts. Juggalos will never be cool, but that's the way we like it though. Hey brother, you okay? Yeah. It was a woman. My bad. A lot of these women are plus size, shall we say? But they're walking around in bikinis or topless. And I love that because it is such an affront to the bullshit beauty standards that we have in society. If they were on a normal beach somewhere, everybody would be giving them shit for that. Here, no one cares. Lots of body pride here. I have seen some women who are so super proud of their bodies and that is very inspiring. It doesn't matter how you look. It doesn't matter how much money you make. It doesn't matter what part of the country you come from. You come here, you're just one of us. It's just like in that old movie, Freaks, you know. One of us, one of us, gooble, gobble, one of us. We accept her, we accept her. ♪ One of us ♪ ♪ We accept her, one of us ♪ ♪ We accept her, one of us ♪ ♪ Gooble, gobble, gooble, gobble ♪ ♪ One of us, one of us ♪ I think it's important that people understand that Juggalos are really the last real subculture left in America. Because when you think about all of the classic subcultures, you think of punk, you think of mods and rockers. You think of goths. Groups that were considered a subculture at one time have now been absorbed by the mainstream. In order for a group of people to be considered a subculture, the mainstream has to hate you. You know, you can take it back to England in the seventies, when you had the sex pistols and you had the Damned and all those old school British punks. They were not welcomed with open arms. The media and the government wanted them shut down. We live in an age where all of those old previous subcultures have ceased to be subculture. But Juggalos are still a group that is reviled and misunderstood. And I think that those are two of the attitudes that are going to create any subculture that has strength. They're not going to like you, and they're not going to understand you. Why did the FBI say Juggalos are a gang? You know, you gotta ask the fuckin' stupid-ass FBI that because I don't know why that is. The FBI never contacted us, asked us what Juggalos were about, anything. First I heard the report, I thought it was just a rumor. I think I asked somebody to look it up and it was a official. Like official, like a referee whistle. It was like. Hold up, you're a gangster. What? You're going to jail. What? That's my first thought. What? Are we going to jail? Are we fuckin' get locked up for this shit? What does that make us, gang leaders? The thing is Juggalos aren't a gang. Right. It kind of sickens me. It's added so much to the prejudice that we already had. It was already the most hated band in the world. And if I wore a Insane Clown Posse t-shirt and I walked down the street, some people would already treat me like I'm less than them. Now there's a government agency telling everyone it's okay. You can be prejudiced against them. They're criminal. If I get labeled a gang member because of what the FBI has labeled everybody, I could lose my security clearance. I could lose my job. I've had somebody make the comment where I work, "Oh, well, you're a gang member." I've never broken the law. I've never been to jail, at least, OK, I worked in a jail, but I've never been to jail unwillingly. ♪ Say fuck the world ♪ ♪ Fuck the world! ♪ ♪ If I only could I'd set the world on fire ♪ ♪ Fuck 'em all ♪ ♪ Fuck 'em all ♪ I was riding my bike. I just had my backpack that has a hatchet man on it. The policeman pulled me over and he started questioning me, started searching me. He asked me my gang affiliation, what rank I was. ♪ Fuck all fifty two states, Oooh ♪ ♪ And fuck you ♪ The only probable cause that they have is this right here. You can get stopped on the street just for wearing a Riddle Box sweatshirt or sporting a Hatchetman charm around your neck. Cops can and they do stop you. They will photograph you and they'll take a picture of your tattoo. They'll put you on a gang list just for wearing clothes. What the fuck is that? You got like a mom taking her 14 year old son, to go to Hot Topic, to buy an Insane Clown Posse shirt. This kid's a gang member? Somehow he's in the same boat as MS-13? Bullshit. Our daughter is four years old. So are they gonna consider her a gang member? So I was trying to reenlist in the military. All the recruiters pretty much like, hey, ICP tattoos, no. Gang affiliated, you know? Cause it's a question on there, are you affiliated with any gang or have been? I got arrested for a DUI and I got separated into a gang unit. Locked up with all these gang members, Nortes and Crips and Bloods. I'm not going to lie, it's terrifying. ♪ Fuck the police, and the 5-0 too ♪ If police look at your car and they determine that's a Juggalo, hundred percent, you're getting pulled over. They start pulling stuff out. We're like, this is gonna take us hours to pack it again. It took us four hours to put it in there. We get back on the expressway and sure enough, if we don't pass the same cops and they have a Juggalo pulled over and all their stuff pulled out of their car. People were getting fucked with on a major level. We did not understand the magnitude of how it would fuck up Juggalos. Didn't know the repercussions of it, you know? And once we started getting the reports, the jokes stopped and the freshness ended and it just started sucking. Fuck the FBI! Fuck the FBI! Fuck the FBI! You know if this were to happen to a band that America liked, the country would be up in arms about this. But it happened to the Insane Clown Posse. So it's a joke. Stop and take us out of the equation. Look what they're saying. If the Juggalos qualify as a criminal street gang, many other groups of fans could be similarly categorized. For example, fans of particular sports teams. A lot of the gangs use sports memorabilia as their gang logo. If you're in a gang neighborhood wearing that particular jersey or cap or whatnot, law enforcement can use that as probable cause for stopping and searching. - The gang label was misguided, but it was also very intentional because I feel like America hates the poor. Right now I work in a restaurant. It's okay. Oh yeah, me? I work at a hardware store. I admit to doing that. I work at taco bell for now. I mean, it's something to get by. I do roofing for a living. Oh, I mow grass. 99% Of my friends, they're in the service industry, fry cooks, just on the bottom chain of society. So to see any unity between these people is a major threat. Like if they're going to come after these kids who put on face paint and throw cheap soda, I mean really, come on. It's the most harmless thing. If they're gonna to come after that, what are they going to come after next? Yeah, we've been together for 16 years now. We've been married for seven. Eight. Eight, oh my goodness, yes. I love you, bye. Love you. There he goes. Love you. Love you. Bye babe. Today I got ready for work with you guys. I drove to work. I love what I do. They have me on their pamphlets. It was just like any normal, typical day. Except for, you know, you guys watched me out in the parking lot. At the end of my workday after I'd seen all my patients, I received a phone call from the head of human resources, wanting to know what this documentary was about. So I told her it was about music that we listen to and how the music is associated with being in a gang. And they terminated me. It's like some crazy communist shit. I don't know what a communist is, but I know this feels like some big, powerful, scary government bullshit. There's no word to describe how insane, how crazy, how asinine it is. I'm about to start making words up. And just think if we just rolled over and took it up the ass, where would it stop? If we don't do something about it, who's next? Check this out, there's some real shit here, man. Real shit man, all right? Fuckin' major news here. Three letters, the FBI. We're not just laying down and taking it up the ass. Check it out, we're taking the name Juggalo the fuck back from them motherfuckers, you know what I'm saying? We have the best legal representation money can buy. There he is right here, Farris. Give it up for our attorney, ya'll. You all have a family attorney now, all right? We're gonna lay the law down on the FBI for the whole fam. People always joke and ask me if I'm going to show up to court in face pain or something like that. If the opportunity presents itself, maybe I will, but... I focus on a lot of DUIs, a lot of possession of marijuana cases, a lot of misdemeanor cases. I see this big guy at an ATM with his wife and kids and figure out that it's Violent J. So I said, "You probably don't meet too many Juggalos that are lawyers." And I was like, "Let me give you my card. If you ever need anything, give me a call. I'll do it for free." And I figured I'd never hear from them again, ever. Violent J announced that Juggalos could come to this makeshift office that I had made at The Gathering and fill out a statement and I could interview them and stuff like that. There was a line out the door and around the corner at that trailer for people making statements. Story after story of people that were doing nothing wrong, but were being treated like criminals. We filed a Freedom of Information Act request to find out why the FBI put them on the gang list. What we got was shocking and surprising. Literally looked like Google research of some news articles. The majority of it was random alarmist local news articles off of the internet saying that there was some crime, whether it's vandalism, assault, stealing, larceny, and the people happened to be Juggalos. And that was what they sent us as support for them putting Juggalos on the gang list. Basically what the FBI said is we're just reporting what these local law enforcement officers are telling us. That was their other excuse. From the outside looking in, it might look like a gang. It also looks a heck of a lot like any other fan base. It starts with Juggalos, but it's a very slippery slope. People who listen to gangster rap. Lil Wayne claims to be related to the Bloods. Maybe people going to his concerts, maybe some of them are Bloods. Maybe they're all Bloods. And then that's sort of where this has snowballed into. That's what's at stake. Whether we live in a free country or not. Whether we live in an America where everything's gonna to be censored and you're going to be afraid to express who you are. I swear to God. The FBI, they might as well be hating on fans of KISS. Are they gang members? No. Why the fuck does that make us gang members? It's a bunch of discrimination bullshit and there's no reason for it. You just find a small group of people that most people don't give a crap about and you box them in and you say those people are bad. Then you just make everybody else say, oh, well screw those people, they're bad. Well, if you box everybody up enough and you make all these small individual bad groups, then everybody's bad and everybody's fighting one another. If having bad taste in music was a crime, every Parrothead in the world would be on the gang list. Here in Los Angeles, MS-13 had a notorious reputation, kind of like Insane Clown Posse, of being kind of eerie and mysterious because some of its members, probably less than 1%, were Satanists. I spent over 16 years researching the MS-13 gang on a daily basis. I was hanging out with active members of MS from the wannabes to the OGs. I would bring pizza or soda pop. The problem was when I was started getting paged at two o'clock in the morning, right? I need a ride home, Thomas. The FBI assessment of the Juggalos as a non-traditional, or hybrid gang, states that many Juggalo subsets exhibit gang-like behavior and engage in criminal activity and violence. So what is a street gang? The federal definition is an association of three or more individuals. Who's members collectively identify themselves by adopting a group identity. Who's purpose is in part to engage in criminal activity and which uses violence or intimidation to further criminal enterprise. We're not a criminal organization. We're not even an organization. We're not organized. Just because I'm wearing this shirt that's got the Hatchetman on the back and everything. It doesn't mean I'm a gang banger. It doesn't mean I'm going to hurt you or kill you. We're just one big family. We look out for each other. We look out for each other. Half of us ain't got parents. Half of us ain't got nobody to give us nothing. It's just the loyalty they bring to you. That's what makes a person family. I'm family, she's family. Hell, shit, all of you are family. Wanna come by later and get fucked up? We can get fucked up. Don't matter, we're family. It means a lot, we like family. This is like a family. It means a lot to me. I love them, they love me. The Juggalo family is the only people that I can trust. That I know if I need something, they're there. There's no more gang members in Juggalos than there is anything else. We sold 10 million records, guaranteed. 10 million people, take a comb through that? Whatever you're looking for is gonna be in there. They say that because some kid committed some, even a horrific crime, that happens to be a Juggalo, that just means all Juggalos are criminals and gang members? It's crazy. People that listen to Mozart kill people. I'm sure Jack the Ripper loves some Mozart. Two men calling themselves Juggalos are arrested after the body of 21 year old, Michael Goucher is found in the woods stabbed more than 20 times. - We've got multiple individuals committing gang related crimes, gang motivated crimes. And they're using the name Juggalo. The media spotlight is on this thing. The media blew it up. It got everybody in an uproar. A Juggalo is responsible for attacking a man on a bike with a meat cleaver. The FBI cited a robbery and a beating of a homeless man. They also cited a Juggalo who shot and wounded a couple in Washington state. The two suspects involved actually had their faces painted like clowns at the time. Shops, restaurants and bars under attack in one of Portland's trendiest neighborhoods. A threatening message laced with profanity. A group called the Juggalo family, taking responsibility. We're just doing what we do, man. We're doing it for the Juggalos, you know? Every business sells to their clientele. Well that's all we're doing. We're not going to water down what we do. If people like it, they like it. If not, fuck 'em anyhow, you know? A number of people who have been associated with acts of violence and murder have had some kind of connection to ICP and Juggalos. They're no longer regarded as innocent lovers of your music. I say bull. I say it's not true. Let me give you an example. In February, 2006. Individual attacks people with a machete in a gay bar, he kills a police officer in traffic stop, he call himself a Juggalo. Someone's been shot. Somebody's been shot?

Take pictures, videos. I think that the focus of that threat assessment was on Salt Lake City because we were seeing heavy activity from our Juggalo groups that made us identify them as gang members. From about 1996 until kind of the mid 2000s, we dealt with Juggalos out on our west side a lot. There were some problems between Juggalos and members of other gangs that became relatively common for a couple years in Salt Lake to have people who affiliated themselves with Juggalos to be fighting with somebody who was a member of another gang. In the summer of 2008, there was a serious assault involving two Juggalos that I charged as an attempted murder. Two Juggalos attacked a young man with a large hunting knife and a battle axe that was mounted onto a golf club. Stabbed him multiple times, took multiple swings at his shoulder and neck area. We get a call of aggravated assault in progress. Initial information given by our dispatch was two male suspects, tan Nissan. My partner finds a Juggalo pendant. It's a Hatchetman hanging on the fence of the house. I see this tan Nissan approach me and I'm like, no, this can't be true. And I see the Hatchetman on the back of the window. And so I was like, you know I got to pull this car over. We're like face to face. And I noticed as I'm talking to him, I could still see some dry blood splatter on his face. I end up doing a search of the vehicle. I pull out all these weapons, lay them out on the trunk of the car. Daggers, hatchets. There was just a whole arsenal of weapons. The victim's neck was just filleted open from the axe. It was one of the more bloody and disturbing crime scenes I've ever seen. I mean, it looks like a slasher movie. We follow a national definition. Group of three or more people, common name symbol identifier, that engage in criminal activity. You know, Juggalos, they fit under those three criterias. It's fair to say that some were gang members. They're violent. You know, the music is violent. ♪ I stab people, 4, 5 people everyday ♪ ♪ I tried to see a shrink to stop that shit ♪ ♪ But it ain't no fucking way ♪ Did you want to stab people? Sometimes.

I always wonder if it would have been different. You know you always think, I wonder if I hadn't married an asshole, if their lives would have been different. This guy was like the worst kind of human being ever. You know what I mean? He'd get super angry at Duke, our dog and he used to chase him around the yard and like kick him. For us, We just stayed out of the house all the time. One of the kind of lingering damages is I don't like to be touched by guys at all. I just snap. You know. My name is Margee Kerr and I'm a sociologist and I'm working on a book about how and why we engage with thrilling and scary material. And coming to The Gathering... I was reading about how negative things happen at The Gathering. But Juggalos themselves would state that they loved each other. It was all about family, all about respect. So I saw this huge discrepancy between what the people themselves were saying and what outsiders were saying. And for a sociologist, that's like a huge red flag. So I wanted to come and see for myself. I see a lot of parallels between the motivations behind hardcore kind of gangster rap and ICP. Both are speaking about their experiences, living in a lower socioeconomic status, being discriminated against, having people judge them. You ever been broke? You ever had a family member, maybe alcoholic or drug addicted, that's impacting your life? Somebody who's just struggling, just trying to make it till the next week or the next month. You're not one of the popular kids. You're not playing sports. You're not in any of the clubs. Growing up, I was kind of tortured, made fun of a lot. My mom moved me from school to school. - I was raised in Philadelphia, in the Catholic Church, in the 80s and the 90s. And what went down there was fucked.

But we can't sing a song about mass murder makes me happy. That's catchy. It's funny. In a way ICP's music was so healing. I didn't need to stand up and rage out because it's kind of like the clowns did it for me. They allowed me to laugh at all that pain and laugh through that pain. - It allowed me to vent things, get things off my chest. All the other music, no matter how cool the beat is, when you listen to what they're saying, you're not really relating to it. These guys are talking about, hey, we're outcasts and we don't give a shit. Come here, Rust. Big 'ole Rusty dog. Did you sing the Rusty song? Rusty dog. What are you doing, Rusty dog? I'll tell you how we met. She was working at a Friday's. TGIFriday's in Minneapolis. And she was the girl at the front that's like, "Hi, can I seat you?" And she sat us down, all set. Put the tables together and I was like, man, I gotta step today. No, I didn't sit you down. Obsolete information. I have a better memory than you. And then I was like, "What're you doing tonight?" What made me super fresh was I was leaning like this, but I wasn't leaning against nothing. I was just leaning against air like that. And I was like, "Why don't you come with me to this concert?" I said, who, what concert? "What concert are we going to?" And I was like, "mine". She came to the show, jumped on the bus with me. And then all you saw was lights and exhaust as we pulled out of town together, never to come back. It's true, the next day I went to Denver.

But there's so much more underlying. One of the things that I always thought was true was when you have to make a major decision, your first instinct on it is from God. And then the rest of your doubt is the devil trying to talk you out of it. And I was brought up knowing that there's something bigger than us. You know, it's something more. Juggalos, they hear it. The messages in the lyrics. Each album gives people a chance to look at themselves in different ways. If our music sounds like endless garbage to you, you're not a Juggalo. You're not meant to hear it. When somebody first handed me an ICP CD, I realized it was starting to answer questions I didn't know I had. What is death? What forever really means. What's going on in the afterlife? It tells you a way to live your life. You know, treat people with respect. Make sure that you live your life right from wrong. Don't judge people. I believe it's the one and only holy man, you know. I believe it's God talking to us. Señor Jesus.

It's just something that's right to do. Nobody ever wants to talk about the good stuff. The bad stuff is what sells, so. Have your chest out like you're fuckin' bad-ass, you ready to fight. I can't do that. Think of like a tough song in your head. I get called bad-ass every day at school. 'Cause you are a bad-ass, ready? I can't stop. I have to do it again. Redo. You can't say, don't smile. OK, get your smile out, get your smile out. I smiled. My room is a explosion of ICP. I'm a collector of ICP memorabilia. I think even if I didn't like the band, I would like their merchandise. It's just really cool. The clowns are awesome. Of course I've got my Ringmaster blanket. My Zippos. This was in the backstage for the wrestling area. That's off of Violent J's shower. It's a very small town. You do tend to get looks when you dress differently than most. Like people you're holding the door open for, they give you just the strangest. What the? They're like, "Oh that's a nice Kokopelli." You're like, "Dude, it's not a Kokopelli, all right?" My Hatchetman will stab your Kokopelli, all right? My name is Shawn Wolf, AKA Sly Guy Smooth. I've been a Juggalo since I was 16. I have raised my kids that way. They know all about it. Hi, Jade Bug. Hi. How was school? That's my Jade Bug. What are you 17 now? Yeah. By two years old, she knew who Violent J and Shaggy were. We had a poster up, you're like "Oh well who's that?" "That's Violent J." "And who's that?" "That's Shaggy 2 Dope." I'm glad that he's into the same music I am or else we would be butting heads a lot with how loud we play our music. Zach's birthday is today. Same as Shaggy 2 Dope's. And he just turned 15. My dad bought me tickets and a VIP pass to the ICP concert tomorrow night. Yes, I'm extremely excited. I can't really express excitement though. I don't know, it's kind of a weird thing that I have. How are you buddy? Not bad, how are you, Dad? Cody is my oldest one, he just turned 18. How was school? Not bad. Me and Cody's mom had like a one-time deal after school. I was only 15 at the time and just stupid kid. Young, dumb, full of come kind of thing, you know? And so she got knocked up. I went over there one day and she'd moved to California. Just didn't tell me or nothing like that, just took off. When he was about seven, she decided to put him into a boys' home. Don't throw it too high. She just abandoned him. Didn't come back and try and visit him or nothing like that. And they actually started trying to work with me to get custody of him. I want my kids. I was raised without a dad and I would never do that to my kids. Somewhere after about a year, they finally sent somebody out here to come in, like inspect your home and make sure it's livable for him. We invited this lady into our house. You see my living room and stuff. It has nothing to do with ICP. It's totally family oriented. Once I brought her into my room and she saw, you know, all of this and it was a bit overwhelming for her, I think. They flat out told me, no, we're not going to give you custody of your kid. I mean, my heart just dropped to the floor, you know? And then they told me why. I would portray possible gang affiliations. Man, it's just a straight kick in the nuts. You know, I really don't even know how to describe that besides flat out, you put me on the ground and beat the hell out of me. I'd much rather have that than someone denying me my kid. For most of my life, I mainly felt like I was alone. There was no one I could talk to, not even therapists. I've been in group homes pretty much since I was six. And my one shot at getting out was him and it was all just vanished as soon as they said that he couldn't have it all because of some ICP thing. A group home is pretty much where kids go who have been labeled all these labels like ADHD, PTSD. Little kids to 18. In a way it's kind of like a leeway juvenile place. Due to some of it, I don't think I was able to mature as quickly as a lot of other people, such as my sister, who's always been around a family member or has always had someone there whenever she needed to talk. People are talking about, well, why don't you just get rid of the ICP stuff? ICP is not the problem. As it is now, he just turned 18. I personally never got custody of him. Flip up a burger. As we come around, we got our VIP Faygos. And the vest that I'm wearing is actually Violent J's vest that he wore. Hello? Hey man. Yeah, I'm doing an interview right now, man. Let me call you back. What? So my friend Kyle just called up and said that the ICP show in Mesa just got canceled. This is my kids' first ICP show. That's crushing right now. We have no idea why yet. Can I help you? Yeah, I'm actually calling about the ICP show tomorrow. I heard he got canceled. Is that correct? Yes, it has been canceled. We were only told that because of the logistical issues. We're not told why. All right, thank you much. Well that's not very fair. Maybe they can use our tickets for the Tuscon show. Get ahold of the promoter or something. Fuzzy, I know, oh, I can get a hold of Fuzzy. I have no idea who that is. What specifically are your concerns about a group like this coming here? Violence. The concert is called Shockfest and one of the headlining bands is the Insane Clown Posse, which is known for its fans, the 'Juggaloos'. A group designated as a gang by the FBI. ♪ Where can I go they don't want me no mo' ♪ ♪ Where can I go they don't want me no mo' ♪ People get most of their information about street gangs from the media. We're hardwired to pay attention to threat. And so the media uses that to get audience share. So they have an agenda to find the most sensationalistic stories to tell about the street gangs. A look at the Juggalos and the danger they present to Northern Nevada. Come October 8th, 3,000 of them will be admitted inside of these doors. - According to one city councilman, violence is a concern. We have too much violence in Fort Myers as it is. Why do we want to add to it? In an email, he wrote, I Googled Juggalos and did not like what I saw. And because this is a city facility, the city council could decide to cancel the concert altogether. We found a spot in Kaiser, Missouri for The Gathering. The camp owners, they knew exactly what the Juggalos were. I didn't hold anything back. And mind you, Kaiser is where the Hell's Angels have held their national biker rally. And it's like, OK so Hell's Angels are welcome, no problem. The media caught wind of it. It was generating all this fear. And so you have all these people in Kaiser, they're just reading the headlines and they see Juggalos, gang. Those two words side by side. The townsfolk were actually calling the camp owners and saying they were arming themselves, getting ready for the gang to come in. Like they thought Juggalos were gonna come storming in there and start destroying like roaming the streets at night causing destruction and havoc or something. The campground owners pulled the plug on the whole thing. And we were left without a Gathering grounds. We were crushed. We absolutely were crushed. Since the Juggalos were first labeled as a gang, more and more The Gathering suffered. Like last year we ended up losing a lot. - We lost a great deal of money. I believe something along the lines of $700,000. Then it was reported on the news that we couldn't pay all the vendors and we were having financial problems. We're not a multi-billion dollar company, you know? That's not like a Pepsi's money that lost. That's not Dorito's. There is no corporate sponsor to The Gathering. That's fresh out of his pocket and my pocket. If The Gathering tanks, we lose our ass. You don't know what's going to happen at The Gathering. Is it going to get raided? Everybody's talking about it. I don't believe it will ever happen, but I wouldn't want it to happen and it very much could. Retailers dropping our line of merchandise because it's gang paraphernalia. We used to have such a good working relationship with Hot Topic. And now, since the gang thing came out, they don't even carry us. Dropped it. It's really fuckin' up our business, man. My daughter's only seven. And I have to maintain this till she's 18. I had to be able to take care of her. It gets harder and harder every year, you know? We got to keep staying relevant. Keep making the right moves and plays because we got a long way to go. Like without this, I don't know what I'd be doing. You know? One time, man, I'm standing there and I'm like in the front row. I got hit with a full two liter of Faygo on top of my head, dude. Almost knocked me the hell out. I wasn't paying attention. That sucker came right down on top of my head, dude. I got messed up, but then I got a full Faygo out of it. Oh, It's All Over, that's a great song.

The closest thing to rebellious music growing up was, uh, Aerosmith. I don't listen to Aerosmith anymore. We filed our first lawsuit the summer of 2012. That lawsuit was just to give the FBI a chance to explain themselves. They didn't really have a good explanation. Now the members of the Insane Clown Posse and several Juggalos have partnered with the ACLU to sue the FBI. This morning, the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Justice and against the FBI challenging the designation of a musical fan base as a criminal gang. One thing that we should get clear right from the start, organized crime has nothing to do with the Juggalo culture. Discrimination based on the type of music a person listens to is flat out ridiculous and un-American bull shit. We are official plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the FBI officially. We're going to war with the FBI. ICP is not defendants and it feels good. You know what I'm saying? It's like a fucking big-ass cheer like. The ACLU, they don't play. And it's gotta be a real cause for them to get involved. The American Civil Liberties Union is the oldest and largest organization in the country dedicated to defending the civil rights and civil liberties of all people in this country. We work on a wide, wide variety of cases, including freedom of speech, freedom of religion, police misconduct, voting rights, rights of people of color, rights of women, rights of LGBT persons. We are here to ensure that our country lives up to its values of freedom and democracy and liberty. I didn't initially see this as being in any way comparable to the other civil rights cases we had. But the more I learned, the more it reminded me of many other of our cases. And it wasn't just about representing a bunch of people who painted their face. There was serious constitutional issues at stake. Throughout history, there has always been a tendency for the government to want to suppress controversial speech. And that could be speech from the left, speech from the right, speech from non-conformists. That's why we have the First Amendment to serve as a check on abuse of government. Because of the First Amendment, people in this country can listen to whatever music they want. They can express themselves the way they wish without fear of police harassment. They can worship the way they wish. There's the right to protest. There's a free press to report. We need music that expresses the times that we're happy. We need music that expresses at times that we're angry. And ICP, they're doing that for their fans. And for me, it was Soundgarden or Jane's Addiction or Ice-T tea or NWA. I mean that's the time when I grew up. But time and time again, every 10, 15 years, we find ourselves in this situation. ♪ Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground ♪ NWA has taunted law enforcement with its lyrics urging violence against police. FBI, how did the FBI situation stuff? There was one guy that thought he would write us a letter. He's in Utah somewhere. I guess he figured if sent us a letter, we'd be like, oh, the FBI sent us a letter, let's stop writing records and doing this. The FBI just seems to find itself once again investigating musicians, fan bases. Whether it's John Lennon, the Deadheads or KISS, they're wrong. Certainly fans of various groups have been targeted throughout history, but I believe this is unprecedented. If we get removed from the gang list, I think everything will go back to the way it was. I believe that. The judge looked at it and said, this ain't even worth going to court, and threw it out. The Detroit based rap group known as Insane Clown Posse has been classified as a gang by the feds. And it's going to stay that way according to a US District Court judge. ♪ How many times will a judge decide my fate? ♪ ♪ Who is he, a bitch, nothing great ♪ ♪ He takes shits, and fucks his old floppy wife ♪ ♪ Plays with his balls and judges my life ♪ They claimed that we didn't have standing to bring the case. And the major argument was the harms we were alleging, for example, people being pulled over by the Tennessee police, those were harms inflicted by third parties. Which is crazy because they're doing that because the fuckin' FBI says we're a gang. The FBI created a gang list to inform the actions of local law enforcement. It's obvious that local law enforcement is going to react. It's a sad, scary, scary fuckin' thing. The First Amendment is a fundamental right upon which many of our other rights are based. And if people in a free country aren't able to express themselves, whether it's politically or socially, we do not live in a democracy. Juggalos should not be afraid to express who they are in this country. They have an absolute right to do that without fear of harassment. - Insane Clown Posse, that name induces laughter everywhere. It's like, all right, yeah, everybody knows we're getting fucked with. Everybody knows the FBI is in their fuckin' courts giving us the the shit end of the stick. One member of a popular rap duo is facing legal trouble for a traffic stop. His drug screen came back looking like a pharmacy. Pain meds, muscle relaxers from hydrocodone to amphetamine. Shaggy 2 Dope attempted to drop kick Fred Durst in the middle of a Limp Bizkit show. The feds say both members of ICP owe the IRS nearly $380,000. ♪ I have a headache, my brain feels dead ♪ You all right? Yeah, man. ♪ I'm trying to hold myself together, impossible task ♪ ♪ My only question, how long will I last ♪ 79 criminal arrests at the festival organized by Insane Clown Posse. A police officer was fired for identifying as a Juggalo. Suspects sporting t-shirts with the Insane Clown Posse are each charged with two counts of rioting. One homeowner we spoke to called it the concert from hell. ♪ I'm falling apart ♪ Now we've been through a lot of shit over the years. Motherfuckers have been trying to stop us since the inception of Psychopathic Records and the Juggalo family. We got the FBI. We got motherfuckers pulling our fucking Gathering location out from under us. But will that fucking stop us? No! The FBI wants ICP dead. Not only that, the FBI wants you Juggalos dead. But check this out right here. We ain't never ever gonna die. You motherfuckers! Little bit louder! Come on! Here we go! ♪ Hey, yeah, yeah ♪ Family, family, family. Last night we filed a 41 page brief in the US Court of Appeals. We're not asking for a miracle here. All we're asking is for the judges to follow the law and give the Juggalos their day in court so that justice may be served. We'll get our day in court in front of the Sixth Circuit. I'd like to think that we'll have a strong shot there. And we're up talking about whether or not the federal courts have the authority to decide in this case, what the heck the Constitution means. By designating the Juggalos as a gang and calling each of the appellants that, by implication, a gang member, you've branded them as criminals. Doesn't the report itself specifically say that there's criminal subsets of Juggalos? The DOJ is not saying that all Juggalos are gang members. - That word subset does no work. It is meaningless to everybody involved here. It's meaningless to the law enforcement officers who enforce the law and that's what's most important. It did nothing to save our plaintiffs from suffering law enforcement and other actions. So let me pause it, I mean, is that- - That was awesome. That was very good. That was great, yeah. That made me feel like this is totally different than your average person on the gang list. In the morning, do I actually remember to say that? If we want to get back in the game and be able to prove that the rights of Juggalos across the country were violated, we need to win today. So this is a critical moment in the case. Good morning, your Honors and may it please this court, the Department of Justice's hybrid gang rule burdens the rights of over a million people in the Department of Justice's own words, based on the actions of a few. Are you disputing that some people that self-identify as Juggalos have done what this assessment says that they do? We're not challenging the finding that maybe eight people someplace in Idaho are acting as a criminal street gang and bearing the name Juggalo for reasons that are out of our control. There is no data to support that this group is engaged in criminal activity because they're not. Their primary purpose is to be music fans and the vast majority are law abiding people. Thank you, counsel. May it please the court, Lindsey Powell for the federal defendants. The 2011 report does not state that all Juggalos are gang members and no legal consequences follow from this report. Not the be facetious, but could you pass the FBI background check and be in your job if you were a member of the Juggalos? Um, I- - These third parties told these folks it was upon reliance on this assessment that they were taking the actions that they were taking. They say the police officer came up to me and I read your group is a gang in the FBI assessment and so I'm going to detain you, search you, whatever it is they say they did. It seems to me a little hard for you to get around that. It's simply information being provided for law enforcement entities to use how they see fit. Thank you, counsel. Appreciate your arguments. And the case will be submitted. Saura did an amazing job. His arguments obviously resonated with the court of appeals because we won unanimously. ♪ You know who you fucking with ♪ ♪ W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-wicked clowns ♪ ♪ You know who you fucking with ♪ ♪ Wicked clowns, wicked clowns ♪ ♪ Wicked clowns, wicked clowns ♪ ♪ Don't fuck with me ♪ ♪ Wicked clowns, wicked clowns ♪ ♪ Wicked clowns, wicked clowns ♪ The county itself is the second largest county in the state.

Most people would just call it simply the court house. I mean, we have the world's largest basket. We have everything from the Grateful Dead to Jimmy Buffet. Lollapalooza was here back in the day. My wife and I have owned it for the last 21 years. And I saw that they had lost their place in Missouri, I think. I'm all about giving people second chances. What up? What up, son? Whoop, whoop. The overall vibe is great. The comradery amongst each other that can only be described as euphoric. We almost flipped this bitch right there. ♪ On Juggalo Island ♪ ♪ We can be one ♪ ♪ Let our nuts hang by the water ♪ ♪ On Juggalo Island ♪ ♪ We can have fun ♪ This is our 13th fucking Gathering. Whoop, whoop,. I know that the community raised some concerns when they found out they were coming here. I got a lot of pushback from the locals and more pushback from the state. Well, they do their internet research like everybody else does. And you hear the stories and we've assured them that we'll be providing deputies inside the venue. There's no law on the books that say it's a crime to be a gang member. We do country shows. We do the hippy shows. And now this is the first time we've had the Juggalos out here. And really, I think the hippies are really the same thing. It's just a little more tattoos, a little more aggressive. But other than that I've had a good time out here with them. It really shocked me because everybody was telling us it's gonna be all this and that. I want a picture, man. Can I get a picture? Sure. Thank you, man. No problem, thank you. Thanks a lot. Thanks, buddy. Thank you, brother. No real issues. Not on our end. For the most part, fans seem to want to take care of themselves, offering out to help each other. If you need more bread, come back and see us, OK? Appreciate you. No problem, man. Keep your homeys hydrated too, all right? Lot of Juggalos don't have much. When they get here, we feed them. Hot dogs, we got water for them. We've got about 800 or so pounds of donated clothing so far that people have brought. We're just the part of the family that likes to cook. May we christen this space our new home. A place where we never have to feel alone. A place of love, music and peace. A time when we can cherish and stress the least. That is not gonna happen, anyway. Hey Kevin or Alan. There's a bunch of ATF guys that tried to get in here. They're just gonna basically go throughout the grounds, giving out everybody the bone. Well, the ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are outside the back entrance to the Gathering of the Juggalos right now which is on private property. What I'm also concerned about is that the ATF often works with the FBI. They can not come onto your property without your consent, without a search warrant signed by a judge. You guys rented the venue from me, but I'm not gonna give them consent. But you're going to explain everything? I'm going to explain it all to them. So if you're ready to go out there. All right, let's do it. That's one of them right there? Is that one of them right there too? I'm an attorney, I'd like to speak to you. You with the ATF? Excuse me, sir. I'm an attorney, can I speak to you? Are you with the ATF? Are you a law enforcement agent? Did he just flick us off? We should point out, very unprofessionally, one of them flicked us off on his way out after refusing to speak to me. After an initial win in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, the case went back to the trial court for another motion to dismiss by the FBI and the Department of Justice. And this time we lost. Hold on, fuck you man. And we went back up to the US Court of Appeals and we lost there as well. Fuck you. Wait a minute, what? Fuck you. The court held that because local law enforcement were not forced to harass the Juggalos, the FBI was not responsible under the Administrative Procedures Act. When it gets thrown out of court repeatedly, how else are you going to stand up? What do you do? You protest. Thousands of demonstrators assembled in the nation's capital for a mass protest. The Lincoln Memorial is forever enshrined as a megaphone for the voice of the American people. From anti-war protests to million man marches. In this great auditorium under the sky, all of us are free. They came from Los Angeles and San Francisco. They came from Cleveland, from Chicago. They came from Jackson, Mississippi, from Birmingham, Alabama. ♪ Smile, I'ma blow a hole in your neck ♪ ♪ And leave you standing there looking stupid like Beck ♪ ♪ Everybody jumps to the Juggalo sound ♪ ♪ Fuck outta here if you ain't down with the clown ♪ ♪ Everybody raised on the East Side, rize ♪ ♪ Everybody raised on the West Side, rize ♪ ♪ Everybody raised on the North Side, rize ♪ ♪ South Side, rize ♪ ♪ Everybody, rize ♪ ♪ Everybody raised on the East Side, rize ♪ ♪ Everybody raised on the West Side, rize ♪ ♪ Everybody raised on the North Side, rize ♪ ♪ South Side, rize ♪ ♪ Everybody, rize ♪ Discrimination.

That was like hands down, probably the greatest day of my life. And there were people there that aren't even Juggalos. They were there because they heard what was going on and they knew it was bullshit. Straight up. And they were there enough to march. That was America, man. We asked the people at the National Mall since we have the day secured and we have our stage set up, could we perform there? And they were like, sure, as long as you don't swear or throw any Faygo. You know what I mean?

The government stating your fans are a gang is undoubtedly bullshit. But so is your music, you know. That hasn't changed, but that's another march. - Even though technically we're still on the list, now the normal person that hears about ICP being linked with gang stuff. To them, it's almost laughable now. It's like, come on these kids are not gang members. We stood up as far as we could. And we said we're not a gang. In our eyes, we feel like we won that shit. I think the best evidence of the success of the case is the complaints that we've been receiving about harassment by local police have dwindled to almost none. To express their appreciation, I even got an invitation to Hallowicked. They invited us onstage to spray Faygo on the crowd. I put a clown mask on and actually went out and did it. But I got out quickly cause I was getting really sticky. This is a case that could go to the Supreme Court. This is a case that is important enough to go to the Supreme Court.
