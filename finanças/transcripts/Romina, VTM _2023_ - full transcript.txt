People think that we are lucky because we were born by the sea. All the fun is here, we don't have to travel for miles for it. They come in the weekend or for a week, they leave behind their worries, exams… work, respect and empathy. Wow, I've paid 15 lei for that drink! Watch were you're going, cow! They don't have time to be nice. They're here to have fun, not to care about the others. That's why I've always divided people between "them" and "us". They come, devour and leave. When the holiday season ends, we're the only ones left. What are you doing, Romina? Are you writing Gino's next song? I was just fooling around. I think you miss Mr. Superstar too much, if you started singing. This will be a full weekend in Costinești, for sure. -I hope there won't be just poor people. -You have plans? I do. To get rich tourists that buy gifts to impress me and I play hard to get. -But you keep the gifts. -Of course. People from Costinești have self-respect. Of course. We are only two beaches away from Mamaia. Let me help you. Come on Vali, don't you know better? A few years ago, I could carry the luggage and you. I was a kid back then. -And now? -I grew up. I hope they haven't left. It took you half an hour to do your hair. Come on, mom, I'll find aunty. Who are you looking for? You don't know what she looks like. If she's anything like your mom… I'll definitely recognize her. -There they are! -There's Mihai! So, all the beauty went on this side of the family! How are you, cousin? Hello, aunty. Look how big he is, Mom, he's almost as tall as I am. Hello! -Welcome. -Welcome. This is Sebi, my best friend. Let me look at you! You grew up. He's a big boy, sis. I'm the same as last year, you just don't remember. Yours isn't bad either. I've set up your rooms and I've fixed something to eat. Let's go! Allow me! I would hate for you to ruin your manicure! -Be careful with that, please. -No worries. I like simple tourists. My dad's place is filled with working people anyway. -It's old school. -Not really. Especially since Gino sings there. -Oh, Gino is coming today, right? -I hope so. How long has it been since you've seen each other? -Three months? -More or less. Why didn't you visit him? Bucharest isn't that far. I wanted to, but he said he's busy, that he had a bad vibe… I don't know. I can't wait for him to come and finally talk. Yeah, that's exactly what you're going to do, talk… Leave her alone. At least, she has someone. Gino and I know each other since toddlers. We practically grew up together. Gino! -You missed me, admit it. -A little. Did you see my latest upload? 50.000 views. -You've just uploaded it? -No, it's a week old. Last summer, my song made you a million views. But, if you count everything from then until now, it's another million, right? Don't worry, girl, Gino will make a million again. I was in Bucharest all day talking to managers and all. Yeah, you were too busy to pick up the phone. The season started here. It's full of tourists. Poor people that come by train? So what? My dad always says that poor people have the most fun. This is what I wanted to talk to you and Mr. Stefan about. I don't think I'll be singing at your place this year. What do you mean? Is Sebi hitting on your mom? No, he's just friendly with everyone. Have you learned to play the guitar? Yes. I'm going to the Conservatory next year, I told you. Wow, you're still such a nerd! Don't worry about it, this is our year, I'm telling you. You strum the guitar, I charm them with words, chicks will drop like flies. This is our summer. No. I brought my guitar to sing on the street, to make some money and help my mom out, you know. Wow, bro, don't ever do that when you're with me, or people will think we're poor. And we're not? Really, Vali, you want to go back to Bucharest a virgin again? I forgot you're suddenly a ladies' man… Who, me? The whole resort knows me. I'm sure the whole seaside knows you. -Right. -Except they all rejected you, right? Who told you that? It's a myth. Nothing words can't fix. Yes? Can I help you? You want a room? I know you, right? You live here. -Man, who's that? -Rebecca. You said you're charming them with words. For three months I've been trying to talk to her and I can't. -Next time, I'll win her over. -Yeah, right. A lot has happened in Bucharest, Romina. I've received another offer. -Have you told her, honey? -"Honey"? This is Pamela. She's a dancer. We got close filming a music video. What do you mean, you got close? Do you know who's her dad? He owns three restaurants in Mamaia. And he's a manager. He gave me a chance. Pamela put in a good word. You know the most important thing for me is my career, Romina. Honestly? You should be happy for us. Come back later. So I've been waiting for you like a fool and you hooked up with nails and eyelashes here? No. Pamela and I are compatible. I'm a Capricorn, she's a Pisces. Everything just… clicked. But you will always be my first love. -Back when no one knew me. -Really? You're a star? Ever since I wrote all your songs! I know, baby, that's why I respect you so much. I'd like us to stay friends, maybe even business partners. You write some good songs for me, I'll even pay you. One hundred… two… as much as you want. Make it 150, halfway. OK. I have loads of money. I'll let this one slide, because you're upset and I get it. I hope we can stay friends. Just like the song says, "You were the first one who stole my heart." I know the lyrics, you asshole, I wrote it! Wow! Did you see that? If you want to, I can slash his tires tonight. Better not. I think that was Pamela's car. And you don't wanna know what a mobster her father is. -Mirela, that boy… -It's the hormones! He's dreaming. But as soon as Nicu is back, he stops visiting Mihai. -Tell me about your job. -It's great! I make 800 euros a month. -But just for the summer? Two months? -I'll pay some debts. I hope so. Bro, I'm telling you. In Costinești, life's good all year round. But during summer… I have two words for you. Wo-men. The girls here are okay, too. But they want relationships. And the tourists are here for how long? A week or two. And what do they want? Sex, fun, alcohol, sex… sex… This will be our summer. And my pimples are gone. I hear you, Mihai. And we will go and meet women. But, before that, I'll take my guitar and sing on the street for some money and to help mom. -Are you in? -No! You want to do that now? -Why not? You can show me around… -Nothing changed since last year. Maybe there are new potholes. Or maybe the punching bag machine is broken. -Oh, no… -And there are… four new shawarma places. -Nice. -Yes. But, regarding the begging, I can't help you out, bro. Maybe if I could play an instrument… otherwise, what would I do? Just sit around like a monkey? You want me to dance? I think you'd be very helpful. Go! See, you're perfect! Sorry, bro… I can't help you. I want to keep myself fresh for tonight. I'll rest a bit and I advise you to do the same, but you know better. Do as you wish. See you there. Dad didn't even care that he didn't have a singer anymore. I knew he was a punk, but I wanted to stay out of it, so you wouldn't say that I am like those parents who are meddling. But when I lay my hands on him, I'll show him! Dad, stop fighting with imaginary people, your blood pressure will go up and… I care more about the restaurant. OFFER Don't worry about the restaurant. -Who will sing now? -Me. Just like I did before that no-good came along. What about your health? I'll be okay. I sang for so many years, I can sing for one more. And then we'll see. Maybe we'll find someone new, maybe… maybe you'll sing. You know I have stage fright. Don't worry about it. The only thing that matters is that you are okay. This little heart of yours will grow strong and beautiful, no matter how much some will try to break it. And some day you'll see a boy and he will see you… and you will realize that nothing that came before matters anymore. Absolutely nothing! -Who are you and what do you want? -I was just passing by. I'm Valentin. -Well, it looks like you're stopping. -Yes… You were singing so nice, that I felt like singing, too. What did you feel like? Scaring off my customers? -What customers? -Good for you, Mr. tourist! You saw with your wise eyes that I have no customers. We're not even open yet! I see that. Seems like a lot of work. Do you need help? Yes. You know how you could help me? Go sing somewhere else. It was just an expression. Go away! -I didn't know you were so bitter. -I am really busy now. Bitter? Bitter! Who's that? -A tourist. -Okay. STEFAN'S GARDEN I'm sorry now that I came down so hard on that tourist. But he had some nerve! Of course, Gino is the king of nerves. Hey! Vama called. They want you to make it like it used to be. What's wrong, boss? Are you shy? Sing, I want to listen to some music. Take this. You got me all wrong, bro. Let me be clearer. I want you to sing a manea. Wait a second. Do you know this one? Let's hear it. Did you hear him singing? Good job, bro! I'm Gino. -What's your name? -Valentin. You're not from around here, are you? I'm from somewhere close to Bucharest. I grew up at Cluj and I have a cousin here in Costinești. Keep the details for your Wikipedia page. So, Valentin from "close to Bucharest", ladies and gentlemen! Give me that guitar, to show you how it's done. -What are you doing? -What? Look at that! Hey, pauper, this is a good street. This isn't the train station in Bucharest where the homeless people sing. Start walking until I stop seeing you and hearing you. You got it? You're ruining the vibe at this girl's restaurant and it's not that good anyway. How are you, Romina? Are you still upset? I made that pauper leave. I told you I'll take care of you even if we're not together anymore. Girls, am I stuck in some tower? -No. -Am I being followed by some dragon and I need saving? No, I only see an ogre. Then, why does this sucker think I need a prince on a white horse to come and save me? Fine, I get it, but when are you going to write some more songs for me? The day the ship wreck leaves. Stop fooling around and give me your notebook. You know that you're lyrics are better than mine. I'll write you some lyrics if you promise to roll them up and shove them in… Buy the big corn, so everyone knows who's the boss! Grab the corn cob and you won't regret it! And to make it slide it in easier, take all the gel from this Five Gang in misery and shove it again up… Better buy my corn and your night will be great! Don't be scared girls, you can take it in installments! CORN And keep at it all night long, OK? You should put a muzzle on that one before she bites someone! Let me tell you how it is. I am a star! Do you know how many wish to write for me? Who's a star? You are? You're a second-hand voice with no talent. Without my songs, you're nothing. Look! I've told you, guys. Romina is a good girl. Baby, I'm a star since I hit the million mark. -Anyone singing it would have made it. -Then why didn't you sing it? I think you should be more respectful, considering that you are talking to a star with 100.000 followers and… He's a star! Using my songs! Anyone can be a star with my songs. -Even that guy! Right, Romina? -What guy? -Valentin "close to Bucharest"? Really? -Even him! You want to bet on it? Yes. If, by the end of the season, he has a video more viral than anything you'll post, you'll never sing my songs again. Okay. And if he doesn't, then you'll write me a new one. But, first, I want to apologize. It's my fault that I didn't realize how desperate you are. Are you stalking me? No! I wanted to see if you're okay. Gino came in strong. You know… You weren't bothering me at all. Big punk. Who the hell would date someone like that? And he cut my strings. I'm sorry. He wasn't like that before. I don't know what happened to him. You know him? Yes. Well… Costinești is a small place off season and everyone knows each other. I think he was always like this. People don't change, it just takes a bit until they show their true colors. It's going to be a shitty summer. I can feel it. Come on. It barely started. Why are you so pessimistic? What do you think? Can I keep on playing it until I get new strings? Come with me. I'm sure dad has a pair of extra strings, so… Come on! Thank you, Mr. Fane. I'll come by the next days with a new set of strings. Don't worry about it. Musicians should help each other out. If you want to help, how about playing that cleaning guitar? -Which one? -That one. Okay. You'll help out others when you'll be my age. Not gonna happen any time soon. Let me get into Conservatory first and then we'll see. Conservatory? You want to be broke for the rest of your life? Money doesn't really matter that much to me. Wait! What is this I am hearing? That money's not important? -Who's the crazy guy? -I am Valentin. -Your sister found him on the street. -So you're hitting on my sister. If you make her cry, I'll break your legs. Be careful with Mugurel. He knows how to be beaten. I'm just kidding with the guy! You're not her type anyway. You're too much of a… ladies' man. Sorry. My brother is… well, my brother. He hit his head as a child and I couldn't fix him. You should sing too, Romina. You know I don't like to sing in front of strangers. What strangers? This is Valentin, my best friend. -We're actually blood brothers. -She sings really nice. Too bad she's shy. And her lyrics almost touch your heart, even when that fool Gino sings them. -I didn't know you were a musician. -Come, you give it a shot. Take this. -Together, right? -Sure. Go. You can really sing. Are you viral? I don't think that is for me. Too bad. With the right songs, you'd gather thousands of followers. And why would I need thousands of followers? Maybe he doesn't need them, but I do. What are you doing tonight? Come by the restaurant. Come on, there will be a huge party! I can't. I promised my cousin Mihai I'll be his wing man tonight. So that's your color, you tourist! Well, my cousin… You don't like girls or what? -I do. -Perfect. Then come to the party and bring your cousin. The most beautiful girls in Costinești will be here. And you can hook him up with Narcisa. Don't you think he's her type? I don't. She likes the rich types. -She doesn't seem my type either. -You haven't even met her. I don't have to. I have my eyes on someone else. Meanwhile, Gino was doing his best to grow as a star. Kissing some rich people ass! Stop! Add more oil! Why the hell do you think I bought these lights for, so your bodies don't shine? We finally meet, my boy. It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Bobby. Pamela told me a lot of good things about you. And she told me about you. She knows how to read people and said you were talented. It would be a shame if you kept singing for that old man, Ștefan. Right, daddy? -I feel like I belong in Mamaia. -You do. You'll be so successful! You'll sing on Tuesday, from seven to ten, as an opener. Hey! I'll tell you what I always tell my chef when he brings my salad. More oil! Got it? Tuesday is the least profitable day, Mr. Bobby. When can I sing on weekends? You're not weekend material yet. You have more growing to do. He's right. You have a lot of potential, but let's take it easy. -You build up a repertoire… -I have one already! -I made one million views last year. -That was last year! With one song! How long will you keep singing that? Until people are bored with it? You need new songs! That is why daddy is giving you a place to grow as an artist. Hey! Don't we speak the same language? I want oil dripping out of you like from a broken car. Am I clear? Don't worry. I have big plans for you. If things go well, by the end of the season, you'll have your own place to sing on weekends. Lead singer, not opening for someone else. -In Mamaia? -We'll get to Mamaia eventually. I need you in Costinești now. -I thought that… -What? That you'll get everything with zero effort? You said he's hard-working, Pamela! I really am hard-working and I appreciate the opportunity, sir. It's too much oil now, you idiots! Hey! Watch where you're going! Jesus! -What took you so long? -It doesn't matter. -Shall we? -Yes. You came. I came. Hi there, partner! Hello, neighbor! Do I know you? We were classmates in secondary school. We live on the same street. -I had pimples. Mihai. -Dana. Tell me what you're drinking, so I can ask the bartender. I am the bartender. Great! Then tell me what you want, so I can tell you, so you can get it yourself. I don't drink on the job. Wow, bro! I thought you were a charmer. I am. I planted the idea in her head. She will wake up tomorrow thinking about me not knowing why. What's your move? What move? At Romina. I don't know. I don't think I'm her type. Well, bro, if you won't make a move… then I will. Weren't you into Rebecca? And trying to charm Dana ten seconds ago? See, bro, that's what you don't get. That's how I work. When I make a move, I go all ways, because you never know who makes a move back. You know what they say: "if you chase two rabbits, you might miss both." Correct. But, I'm chasing ten. Something has to happen. Hey? -Can you move? -Thank you. I will take a short break now, but, first, I want to call on the stage a very talented young man. Thank you, pops, but I have a place to sing that's better suited for me. A talented young man that I met today. He impressed me with his beautiful and warm voice… Valentino! Alright, bro! This is my cousin! Valentino? What name is that? Vali from "close to Bucharest"! They're really desperate. For real now, Valentino sounds better than Vali from "close to Bucharest". I believe you can do it. You want that loser mocking you again? Go on! I believe in you. Listen! When he gets on the stage, record him and upload it on the Internet. Okay. Okay, but come sing with me. If we're to make a fool of ourselves, at least, let's do it together. I can't. Then I can't do it either. People tend to feel things according to their importance. And for me, at that time, it was more important to teach Gino a lesson than to sing. Don't look at them. Look at me. Close your eyes and imagine that it's just the two of us here. Throwing up? Delete that right now, or I'll pour this over your head! I'll delete it. I was just messing around. But the one on the stage was fire, and I've uploaded it! -Are you sure you have to leave? -I want to stay! I would stay, but look at him, I have to take care of him. No, I have to take care of him, because I'm older. Six months older. -One last drink. -You had enough. Call Dana! -She's busy. -Call Dana! She's busy. Call Dana! -She's busy. -Okay. Tell her to… to call me. Tomorrow morning. I followed her on social. -What's this for? -You sang. The artist must be paid. And you? I got what I wanted. Money is no match to that. What are your plans for tomorrow? I have the day off. I'm going to the beach with my girls… You should come. Let's go now, why wait until tomorrow? We're going home. -See you tomorrow. -See you! You like her, don't you? Honestly, and I'm only saying this because I know you won't remember a thing, I think I'm in love with her. Be careful with the girls around here. They're different. You're a simple guy, it's not easy. Why are we doing here? Let's go home. I think we should take a walk, so you sober up a bit, because if aunty sees you like this, she will kill us both. Where were you? I've been calling you. I was in Costinești. What, did you miss me? I vouched for you, so you can sing for daddy, and what do you do? -Wander around in Costinești? -Wow, two whole songs? Let's go in. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much! I'll be taking a break now. Please welcome to the stage… Giani! -Gino. -I know, bro. I was joking. That punk threw his drink on us and now we smell like alcohol. You know what I'm thinking? What will our mothers say when we get home, because I'm sure they're worried sick… Hello, I haven't seen you there. Hello, how are you? -I must look like an idiot. -Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? Your poor mothers are sitting here worried… Sebi, stay out of it. Give me a break, Mirela, he needs a role model in his life and you know it. He has his father. An since when are we on a first name basis? -What are you doing here? -He said he needs some homework from you. -At night? During the summer holiday? -Don't change the subject. Sebi, go home. Okay. But call me if you need me to give him a lesson. Good luck, bro. Just as I thought. They went clubbing. Oh, come on, it's not even midnight. And we behaved, I promise. And we didn't drink. Well, I didn't. Cousin, here, on the other hand… you know how it is. Mom… you know me. I only drink a little. But still, clubs? We can't afford to spend money. Well, we didn't just drink for free… -Didn't you say you didn't drink? -Yeah, mom, that's not important. Valentin sang on a stage and he got paid for it. Look! Keep it. -It's your hard earned money. -Okay. Stop fooling around. Go take a bath. You smell like an ashtray filled with vodka. Good night. You were really drunk last night judging by how pale you look now. I don't want to get sun burned. Don't worry, no one thought of that. You protect yourself really well. You're so funny! You look a bit red. If you need some cream, you can rub unto me. Let's get you washed up, before everyone laughs at us. It's not that bad here. The best place in the country. I was feeling good. I really deserved a relaxing day. So, of course, you know who popped by. To suck the life out of me. Wanna see something cool? I dare you. It's your turn. Look, honey. This is the beach I was telling you about. There are no sunbeds here. They are really poor, Gino. -I could eat you up. -Take it easy! I can't, baby, you're so beautiful that I can't contain myself. If you can't contain yourself, the toilets are up on the left. -You're taking up my sun. -Oh, Romina. I didn't see you there in all that sand. Just the girl I was looking for. I'm not writing any songs for you, cut the act. Very well. I don't want you to. I've realized that… to grow as an artist, I need to write my own music. It took you ten years of school to learn to sign your name and now you're writing music? And as soon as I'll write a new album, I won't sing your songs anymore and I'll leave you alone. You wrote his songs? And we'll forget about the bet, so you can forget about Vali No-Money. I'm sure it's not easy for you. What bet? Oh, she didn't tell you? We made a bet that she can make anyone more famous than me. You are "anyone". We don't need your bad jokes. We were having a good time until you came here. You didn't tell him? Oh, Vali, you really are a loser. She didn't tell you that we dated? I was her first real love. She's trying to make me jealous, but it's not gonna happen. I mean, look at you! Yeah, right, Romina and the lowliest of the punks on the seaside. Right, Romina? And the bet? That's why you followed me? -"Dad has some strings?" -Please, let me explain. -Don't bother, I got it. -It wasn't like that. Please, wait. Gino, you are the worst. The worst! I thought you'd be happy to get rid of me. Look at that! I only tried to be nice… Let's go, my love. Look! Spoils of war! Where is everyone? Oh, I'm so over all of this nonsense. Let's go for a ride on this little banana! It's not too long, nor too wide for a frightened girl! It's neither thick, nor fast… -He's coming straight at us, the pig. -Mihai, is that you? Hello, neighbor, it's not me, just a guy that looks like me. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? -I am, ma'am. -Leave my hat. I'll give you a napkin to cover yourself. That should be enough. -Hey! Stop there! -Shut up! Hit me, not the banana! Crazy! You're crazy! -Really funny. -Thank you, I know. -Where is everybody? -Wait! Why? I was an idiot. I really thought that… No. I was an idiot. And I am sorry. But I know what I want now. I want to make music with you. -Go away! -No! Give it to me! You'll try to slash the banana again. You deserve it! I was very clear when we broke up. As you look at the ship wreck, you get the left side of Costinești and I get the right side. -Why are you on my side? -You're nuts! Why are you on my side? Just look straight at the ship wreck! You can't look straight at it. It's an imaginary line that goes straight through here and divides… Folks, no matter where you are in Costinești, you're facing the ship wreck. Look at that, the tourist is teaching us about Costinești. I hate these tourists! You're gonna show me how to sell corn now? Get out of here! Go! I swear on my children! The new ones, not ours! Calm down! Don't touch me! The next weeks went by like a dream. We sang, we had fun, we were in love. Valentin got more and more famous and we didn't making any efforts. And we also did things that I can't talk about. Kill it! Kill it, guys! Do it! Shut up! Good, Doru, good! Come on! Do it! Excuse me, I'm looking for the bathroom. -Take it easy, guys, it's a party. -Me and my brother? Don't worry about it, we made 500 Euros with this fight. -We'll be back in a couple of minutes… -Okay. -Do you like him? -Yes, he's talented. -He's my cousin. -Really? Congratulations! Thank you. Could you do a promo story? Yes. He really deserves it. Here we go. Not with him. He's talented, he has enough followers. With me. I need help. -And post it on my profile? -Yes. Oh, okay. Come on. -Is this you? -Yes. Done. Posted. Bye! -Can you follow me back? -Hello. -Sure. -Yes! Did you see how many views our video has? Over 100.000. My idiot brother thinks that if he added the part where I threw up, we would have over one million. What's up with you? My mom was fired. Not enough tourists. She went back to Bucharest and told me to go with her, but I wanted to stay. You made the right choice. We'll make money and you can send her some. -It will be okay. -Don't worry about money, bro, look at the rate I have on these three games. I don't know how this stuff works. I never bet on anything. It's easy, you open "Get's bet" and if you have a good tip, it's free money. Get it? It's a tie, but it's okay, I'll take the X2. Now, it's important to… How is it possible in just ten seconds? Look at him… he hasn't scored all season and now he's Messi all of a sudden. Free money, right? That's life, bro. You lose some, you win some. You're shitting me! It's a tie again. What is this? Are they playing without a goal-keeper? I told you it was a sure thing, that's why they call me Nostradamus. They do? Or that's how you want to be called? Yes. Valentino and Romina! The best couple on the beach! Eat shit! Really, Romina, I keep trying to make up with you, guys, and you won't let me. Listen, this is my last offer. I have a launch party on Friday for my latest hit. There will be a big crowd. -I'd like you to come, too. -We'd rather not. -Saving the dolphins? -Yes. It's for charity. Ten percent on the ticket money goes to an organization that massages dolphins or something. Whatever, they're saving them. What, you don't like dolphins? Dolphins are cute. If you don't come, it means you don't care. Yes. Gino and the dolphins. It was clear that something shady was going to happen. Maybe Valentino will sing a song with me, if you let him. You'll be trending, I'll be trending, we'll hit it big time! Why not? I'll get more exposure. It can't hurt. Can't you understand that I don't want to be in the same room with him? Why not? We don't have any beef with him. Except for money! And there's enough for everyone. Some extra money wouldn't hurt. You said you were over everything he did to you. You said that. Oh, my! Problems in paradise? I'm leaving. Here! Take one. We won't go if you don't want to. Romina! She's difficult. Don't I know? Gino, just because I don't want us to be enemies, it doesn't mean that we have to be friends. You know better. I'm into peace and money. I know them. You had a good tip. Just the guy I was looking for. Is your mom home? No, she went to the market. How did you get in? Don't change the subject. I'll be back. I told you he's hitting on your mom. Don't you think I know that? But, he's a superstar at school. If I hang out with him, people will think I am one, too. -And? -If he didn't do all the chores in the garden and in the house, mom would ask me. -For sure. -Yes. And he's twice as tall as dad? You think mom sees anything in him? If you say so… Are you sure you don't want to go? It will be the biggest party this weekend. -I don't care. -And it's for the dolphins. Be honest, you don't want to go because you're afraid of Gino? I know you're trying to play me right now, but it's not working. You can go by yourself. There's no fun in going there by myself. -I told you that she's at the market! -I know, but I found Romina. -Hi. -Hi. We'll give you some space. -Sebi, wanna grab a beer? -No. OK, let's go. I gave it some thought and you're right. I have to move on from everything that happened with Gino, and avoiding him is not a solution. And you have to be seen by as many people as possible. To see how cute and talented you are. So we're going to the party. We are. But we're going in style. Yes. And we have lots of style. Well, we could do better. I think it's time you looked like a real singer. -What do you mean? -You'll see. Mugurel! Ladies and gentlemen! My good friend, that you all know from the Internet, the star of this summer in Costinești, Valentino! Kisses, Gino! He's my cousin! Come up to the stage! The artists don't sit with the crowd! I have a bad feeling about this. -We shouldn't have come. -Stop being paranoid! Relax. I told you everything will be OK. Even Dana is having a good time. I don't understand your mood change. Maybe they'll get along. What if they become friends? In fact, you've already made Vali look like Gino, so you're turning him into Gino. Let's hope he doesn't take his character, too, right? Actually, if I think about it, Gino used to behave like Vali a few years ago. Maybe all the guys around you end up like that? Great, as if I wasn't already afraid that might happen! These have more soda, right? And now, the moment you've all been waiting for, my new hit! This is my song! He stole it! How could he steal it? It's new! No, I wrote it! Back when he was in Petrești! Valentino, my man! I'm you're number one fan. -I've seen you online. -How are you his number one fan? I showed him to you! Thanks, I didn't know I had fans. So, are you coming to our private party? This one is lame. We have a pool, too. I can't, boss, I have to stay here all night. Take Valentino. He's free, right? I'll stay with my friends. Well, you're all invited. Right, bro? Right! -I don't have that much experience. -Come on! Don't worry! How much do you want? A thousand, two? It's my treat, bro. Here! Take three thousand. Bro, are these real Euros? But I have no equipment or musicians… I'll help you out. Hey, come here! Take this money and you sing with Valentino tonight. Play nice. Do you know how lucky you are? You're in the big league now. -Where's Romina? -You're like Siamese twins. I'll go look for her. You go and take this chance… -Where's Romina? -I don't know. She's not answering. I looked everywhere for her. I got bored and I came here, so I don't miss the party. But you should know that she had a few too many. I hope she's OK! No, thanks, bro, I don't drink. -He's one of those people! -You're right. Don't worry, I told Gino to look for her and tell her to come here right away. Gino? Really, Narcisa? What were you thinking? I didn't know anyone else in there. Okay, now, if I think about it… Sorry? Look, he wants to split with our money. -I'll make a quick phone call. -A phone call? You hear that? I didn't pay you to make phone calls. I gave you 3000 Euros. For that kind of money, you'll sing and clean my house at the end of the night. Get your ass up there! It's busy! Leave me alone, I feel sick! Valentin, is that you? I have low coverage. I'll go outside and call Romina. I'll come, too. Stay here. I have a bad feeling about this. -He's sparing for time, bro. -I don't know where the musicians went. Those two? -They left. -I can't sing without them. Oh, he can't sing without them. -Then why did you let them leave? -I let them? And they took the money, too. I paid you and it was your responsibility. I don't care! You thought I was Vali? He's long gone and he left you here alone. -No. -Yes. -He went to a private party. -You're lying! Why would I lie, baby? It's simple. He took the first opportunity to leave. -You think he's like you? -Really, Romina. I know I was wrong, and I am sorry. Bucharest drove me crazy. -Please forgive me. -Don't touch me! What about the new song? Didn't you think I would recognize it? It's my song! -I took it from your notebook. -You stole it. I didn't steal it. I took it to show you how much I cared about you. You make me sick. Believe me, you are the only girl that I've ever loved. -I would do anything for you. -Then leave me alone. Where's Valentin? -Who cares about that loser? -You're the loser! You've always been a loser! Valentin is really talented. That's why I took the bet that he will have more views than you. Seriously, Romina. It will be hard to find another guy who can sing. After what will happen to Valentin tonight, you won't catch him around here anymore! Stop the whining, you've ruined my party. He came here unprepared. Where's the rest of the money? I told you, the musicians have it. -We gave it to you, not to them. -So now you owe me? Let's take him outside…. -Let's have some fun! -Yes, bro. A guy said he scratched a white Mercedes in the parking lot. Does any of you own a white Mercedes? Bro, give me your key and I'll check on both. I didn't want to leave you alone. I didn't think Gino would do that. And Narcisa texted him because she couldn't find you… I was afraid you stayed with him. I wouldn't do that if he were the last man alive. That's why you left? And there were those friends of Gino, those mobsters, who said I owed them 2000 Euros. And if they ever see me in Costinești, they'll break my legs. Come with me to Bucharest, we have clubs there too. We're young, we're talented, I think we'll be fine. You are my life, Romina. Bye! What, Mugurel? My little girl, I though I'll never see you again. It will be okay, dad. You'll see. I promise. Of course it will be. It was just a cough. The doctor said you won't be able to sing anymore. What will we do? We knew this day would come. We'll manage. You know, I was thinking… We'll sell the restaurant. Mr. Bobby made me a good offer. What do you mean? It's our only connection to mom. Things change. That's okay. We'll… The important thing is that we have each other. No! It belongs to the family! I'll make it work, you'll see. I don't need Bobby. We'll be alright, dad. Valentin will sing. Valentin is a good boy. -Valentin went back to Bucharest. -Too bad. He didn't pick up. And I understand why not. I put my ambitions first and our relationship second. TEMPORARY CLOSED Why did you stop? It sounded good. I don't know. I worked on this with Romina before I came back to Bucharest. I can't finish it alone, something is missing. I like it as it is. SINGERS WANTED If you don't have money We have nothing. Not even a mediocre one. Except for me, of course! The sad part is that you weren't the worst today. That's practically a compliment. The musicians left, too. After your dad's health problems, they asked to be paid upfront. Upfront? I barely got enough money to pay for the electricity bill. -What will we do, Romina? -I don't know. We tried. We really tried everything, right? It wasn't meant to be. I've always been afraid of the stage, but, on this stage, I was the least afraid to go on. This is where dad sang… and mom, it would be a shame if I didn't sing for the last time. What about the throwing up? Should I place a bucket next to the microphone? I had an idea while singing with Valentin. If the audience is the problem, then I shouldn't see the audience, right? How was it? Okay-ish. I'm telling you, honey, this video will be a hit! Five million views! At least! You said that the last time. I hope it will. Daddy spent a lot of money on it. This is your last chance anyway. Thank you for joining us! Sorry, we were … you know. Bam-bam, get it? He's not that great at it, but he's enthusiastic. -You look really happy. Good news? -Not exactly. Let's face it. We'll never get the money for the next month's rent without a good singer. But we can have a beautiful last memory, one last party for all the years we spent growing up here, me and Mugurel. Don't be upset. I'll find a new job. Waitresses are always wanted. You'll be a barber. -A hairstylist. -Whatever you say. We'll be alright. And we'll take care of dad. We have each other, that's what matters. And we have our friends. We'll do without them. Dana! What are you guys doing here? Why are you so sweaty? Did you run all the way here? If I ran, I wouldn't be so sweaty. -She went full throttle. -You call that full throttle? I had to slow down at 111 mph. He was yelling that he was fainting. I was fainting! Didn't you say we had to get to Vali ASAP? -What's the emergency? -Romina is closing down the restaurant. -For real? -You have to help her. You know I care about Romina, but I really don't know what I could do. And it seems to me like she did it all to herself. She didn't ask for my opinion on anything. I told her. She could have come with me and leave everything behind. But she didn't want to. She's closing the restaurant for good. You can at least be there for her. Listen to this. I think I have an idea. Dear guests! I'm happy to have all of you here with us for the last time. Let's have some fun for the last time. Where are all the butterflies and rainbows? Why do you look normal? Who, me? Thank you. I wanted to tell you that everything is over between us. You had your chance, but you blew it. I'm with Dana now, and I want to say… that we are very happy together. If you ever DM her, I'll scalp you. You, too. -Who was that? -I have no idea. I'm sorry. I really can't do it on my own. You know it? I've memorized it on the way here. I've changed some lyrics. Don't. Look at me. Nothing else matters. Hi, everyone, I see there are many of you watching. I want you to know that we're closing our place today and these two talented kids will never sing again. Unless you help us with a like, share and subscribe. And especially some donations! Kisses from Mugurel. They're good, right? Did you see the donation button? I've donated already. You don't have to hold back. I'm 18 years old already. Really? Then look me up in another 18 years and we'll talk then. TWO WEEKS LATER This is stupid. It's recorded with a phone. -There are no cars, no girls, nothing. -It has two million views. And we made enough money to pay the wages and the rent for the entire summer. So, what? Mine has, too. How many does it have, baby? -Two hundred thousand. -Two hundred and twelve and counting. We just have to wait a little longer. I think we've waited enough. Oh, and who do you think now has one million followers? So what? You were lucky it went viral and you have chemistry. -The song is lame. -A bet is a bet. I don't care about the bet. You expect me to stop singing your songs because of a bet? So what if I stole them? What am I supposed to do if I can't write my own lyrics? Right? You can sing wherever you want to, but not in daddy's clubs. You're fired and… good luck! -What? -Our fans are waiting for us. We really have to expand the garden. The summer is almost over. It makes no sense to do it now. -We can prepare it for next year. -Okay. And this is how I got my music back. The rest of the summer flew by fast. I was hoping it would last forever. Gino did as always. When people found out he stole the songs, no one wanted to work with him, so he went to a reality show with his new girlfriend. When I came to this show "Next to the Love Oasis" I thought I found real love. How could she cheat on me with… him? He can't even sing. GINO CONFRONTS HIS GIRLFRIEND LOVER Do you want to come watch it? ONE YEAR LATER Leave me alone, bro, I need a freaking miracle on this bet. Do what you want. Yes! GG 90! -Mr. Balint? -Hello, Mihai! The people at "Get's bet" sent me to ask you to close up your account. -What do you mean? -You're too good. You had too much success and they could go bankrupt because of you. What can I do, Mr. Balint? I'm a genius. You sure are. Good thing I got here before the people over at NASA started questioning you. Now… what do I get from "Get's Bet" if I close my account? Ten million Euros? And a helicopter? And a car that turns into a submarine. -I saw one in Dubai. -Done. As soon as I get them, I'll close the account. But, first, you'll have to hold a speech in front of your class, naked. You might see two tigers in the front row and your teeth will fall off at the end. What? Mihai, wake up! -Mr. Balint? -Come on, we're shooting! My dreams are way too real. I forgave Gino in the end. He atoned for his sins and paid Valentin's debt, so the mobsters stop looking for him.
