Please forgive me, Ra. I didn't mean to do that. But I love you... not Anita. I didn't know... that it'd turn out like this. It feels like I'm being framed. For the sake of Allah, I always kept my loyalty to you. Don't put the name of God in a lie. Ra... Ra... Ra... Ra, hear me out. I'm telling you the truth because I don't want you hear from someone else. We can still be together, right? I don't have to be with Anita. Anyway, the fetus that's inside of Anita... isn't necessarily mine. Because... we did it just once. Just once. You're the only one I want to marry. My love is forever yours, not for other people. Love takes care of each other. Haste is just lust. Marry her. I can't do that. I... Do what a man is supposed to do. Ra... Are you a man? Where should I put this, miss? Just cancel it, sir. Cancel? Asma? Asma? THREE MONTHS LATER Peace be upon you, Asma. And upon you peace. - How are you? - I'm good, Praise God. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you peace, Mr. Ridwan. Welcome to Beijing. I'm so happy that you came here. I'm happy, too. There's a silver lining from that case. You could come here because of that. If you were married, you wouldn't be chosen as the rep of the correspondence bureau here. All incidents have a silver lining, including heartbreak. Why're you interrupting? Stop preaching. Asma has told you everything in the e-mail, why bring it up again? It's different if I can hear it directly from Asma. You can talk about it later. Asma will be here for a while. Let her take a rest after her flight. Where are we heading, dear? To the apartment, right? I told you that we have to go to the office. You didn't say that, you said to the apartment. To the office. - Apartment. - Office! - Sir, please take us home. - No, take us to the office. - Go home. - To the office. - Home. - Office. Okay. Be careful, sir. You're annoying. I love you. I love you. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you peace. What do you think? Do you like the apartment? I like it. It's really nice. Where to put it without blocking the way? You can put it over here. I chose this apartment so you can live near us. I live two doors away from you. So if you need anything, you can call me directly. - Thank you, Sekar. - Anytime. - I brought your favorite drinks. - Praise God, thank you, Ma. Why don't you get some rest? You shouldn't be sad anymore. Hopefully, you will meet your Mr. Right on this journey. I think you will meet him in Beijing. - I'll go home, now. - Okay. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, Asma. - And upon you peace. Why did you mention about Mr. Right to Asma? You must have been eavesdropping to know. No need to eavesdrop, you were blaring it out. Let her be focused on her career. You don't know anything about women, dear. Life partner and career should go hand in hand. If one of them is left behind, women could be restless. You're annoying. INDONESIAN NEWS CORRESPONDENT OFFICE - Asma. - Sir. Welcome to Beijing. - Thank you, sir. - Hope you feel at home. So, do you have a new title for your column here? We want to create some layout and design for the title. I have it already. "Assalamualaikum Beijing." - Asma. - Yes? Has your guide arrived yet? Not yet. I'd better get going now. Alone? - Yes. - Don't do that. How about this? You go with Ridwan. Let me call him. No need. I can go by myself. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Okay, then. - I'll get going, then. - Okay. What? Where do I get down? Did I miss it? I don't know. Asma. Asma? Ashima. I mean... Ashima? - Peace be upon you, Sekar. - Asma. Have you arrived? Are you lost? I haven't missed the bus stop. I was just panicking before. Luckily, a handsome guy helped me. Is he a local? Chinese guy? He's a local guy. What language does he speak? He's using English. No. You need to be careful. He might be a kidnapper, or has bad intentions. You need to be careful. Don't trust anybody easily. What? A kidnapper? Hopefully, I could take care of myself. Okay, Sekar. Peace be upon you. And upon you peace. Excuse me. Is this all you got? Good. He's handsome. How could you know? From his back. You need to find out more about this Zhong Zhong. You have to. - Zhong Wen. - Zhong Zhong. Zhong Zhong sounds cuter. Chinese names have always been repeated. Fan-Fan, Ling-Ling, Fang-Fang, Han-Han. Am I right? He is suitable as my column resource. But, how can I find him? You need to search for him. Who knows, he might be the one for you. He will be mine if it's meant to be. No need to chase him. That's not how it works. To make it come true, you need to chase him, so he will be your life partner. What Korean movie did you base your formula on? Every Korean movie. They are all so wonderful. You will be crying when you watch them. I'm here to work, not to seek my soulmate. The most important thing is having the same faith. Can avoid complex problems in the future. Who knows, he might want to become a Muslim. It can't be that easy. His family may not approve it. What if he loves her? Talking about love... plenty of people have left their religions for love. What's wrong with you? I'm not talking nonsense. Please ask him when you meet him again. Maybe he wants to convert to Islam. At first, I thought that I'll be alienated in the Bamboo Curtain country. A girl in hijab among the yellow-skinned society. I was wrong. Islam isn't something strange here. They called Islam "Yizilan jiao." Or "the pure religion". And they call Mecca as the birth of "Mahyao" or Muhammad the Prophet. We aren't the only women with hijabs, me and Sekar, my friend, but lots of other Muslim women here. Let me see the pictures we took recently. Here you go. This is the ancient heritage. Ashima! It's Zhong Wen, Ashima. This is so beautiful. Asma, Zhong Zhong! It's Zhong Zhong. - Zhong Wen? - Zhong Wen. - Where is he? - He was there. I saw him chasing our bus. And he was waving his hands. He was chasing us. By the time I realized, he was already gone. I swear, I didn't lie to you. How did you know that it was him? You have never seen his face. His back. His back? I'm such an expert on people's backs. Just put Ridwan in the middle of a thousand people on a strike, I will definitely recognize his back. That means Zhong Zhong was looking for you. Zhong Zhong wants to see you, too. Okay. If that was really him. If it was really him? If it was really him. It is so romantic, so romantic. It's so romantic. Can you be quiet? Sorry, ma'am. Thank you. Due to your Korean movie. You overdosed on Korean movies. - Well... - What do you think, sir? Okay. - Okay? - Yes. - Thank you, sir. - Yes. Praise God. RA, HOW'S YOUR WORK? DEAR, YOU HAVEN'T REPLY DOZENS OF MY EMAILS. Hi. Asma? How are you? I am Sani. I'm Sani. I was asked by Mr. Daniel to be your guide. Okay. Sorry, yesterday I had an exam so I can't accompany you. It's okay. Where do we want to go today? I want to go here. Okay. The "Great Wall." - Let's go. - Okay. - Your Indonesian language is so fluent. - I can speak four languages. Asma, according to Chinese people beliefs, if they succeed to climb the Great Wall, it means they've passed the test to be a great human being. How cool is that? - So pretty. - Thank you. Now, you can take pictures of the views, enjoy your trip. Take your time. I want to go around, I'll be back soon. - Don't go too far. - Okay. Bye. Come over here. Look at the beautiful view. Over there. The mountains are from the three kingdoms. Look over there, so beautiful. You can enjoy the view. So beautiful. Enjoy the view. Do you enjoy the view? Come, we will go down there. Zhong Wen? Zhong Wen. Zhong Wen. Zhong Wen. Zhong Wen. What's going on? What do you want? - I'm sorry. - It's okay. The 6,400 km long Chinese Wall was built with blood and tears. The scenic beauty mingles with the laments of sadness in each stone. The silent witness of the victims who died because of it. You need to visit Summerhouse of Tao, romantic gondola dinner, but you have to come with someone's you love. - Let me carry. - It's okay. - It's okay. - Okay, then. Sani, is the shop owner a Muslim? I don't know. But it seems like that. What's the matter? He's suitable as my resource. Can I interview him? Okay, then. Let me ask him first. Wait here. Don't go anywhere. Excuse me, sir. I'm Sani, my friend is a journalist. Would you be her resource for her article? - Okay. - Seriously? - Yes, she can. - Thank you. This is Asmara, my friend. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you peace. Please, come in. In the seventh century, Islam teachings have spread from the Middle East into the Central China through the legendary Silk Road. Therefore, Islam has a rich history in China. And it is recognized as one of five official religions in China. But, the followers are among the smallest in numbers. There are only 20 millions of Muslims. It's actually rather fantastic numbers. And now, I've become one of 250 thousand of Muslim in Beijing. A city which acts as a balance of traditional and modern values. Like those who maintain the purity of Islamic teachings among the majority of followers of other religions. You weren't really sick, perhaps you're missing someone. - Zhong Zhong seems a romantic guy. - How could you know about that? This is the proof. You're sick because of missing him. - What's going on, Ma? - I don't know. Excruciating headache, like needles stabbing. Heading to the doctor now. No need. I will get better tomorrow. Don't be so stressed about your column. Mr. Daniel surely won't mind if you skipped a week on your column. I know, but my readers will be asking questions. Let's eat some more. Thank you for one more day that you've been given to me, Lord. Ashima. - Sani? - Sani? Friends. Work partners. We were joined in a translator community here. Why do you look so surprised? So you can speak Indonesian? I'm a translator. I must be able to speak various languages. Then, why don't you tell me earlier when we met on the bus? I realized you're Indonesian from your phone call. Wait a minute. So, you understood what I was saying on the phone? Yes, but not too much. I just know I might be suspected as a kidnapper who trafficked in Beijing. Yes. Why are you shy, Ashima? Don't worry. I understand, you have to be aware of yourself here. Now, I'm ready to work. I'm ready to serve an Indonesian columnist. What can I explain for you here? How old is this mosque? - 100 years old? - It's more than that. This mosque was built in 996 A.D. - Wow, it was more than 1,000 years ago? - Indeed. The difference with other Chinese buildings, there are Arabic writings and Islamic symbols. Just like that. This is the "Watching moon tower." This tower was used by the priests to watch the moon positions when determining the fasting schedules. Let me see. - Can it be used for Azan, too? - Yes, it can. If the Buddhist temple is built facing South, then this mosque is built facing to Mecca, like other mosques whose Qibla direction leads to Mecca. The sundial. - It's to determine prayer times, right? - Indeed. You know many details about this mosque, perhaps... Perhaps what? Nothing. I will ask you about it later. - Let's go inside. - I'm sorry. I can't go inside. - What? - I mean, I'm not allowed. Why? I'm not a Muslim. Please. I will wait for you outside. Zhong Wen. This is for you. For me? But I'm not a Muslim. It's okay, just keep it. Thank you. Please try it. There you go. - You look good. - Really? Do all Muslim women in Indonesia shake hands that way? Yes, especially for the ones wearing a hijab. So, men and women shouldn't touch each other? Yes, except with their own "mahram." "Mahram?" Mahram means the forbidden man, or should not be married. Other than mahram, only the husband is allowed to see a Muslim woman without the hijab or touch them. - What about kissing? - It is not allowed. - Hugging? - Enough. I don't want to answer it. - I'm asking you in seriousness. - Of course it's not allowed. Ashima. If there's no religion, there will be no killings, violence and war. Violence and war happen not only because of religion. The human's ambitions to rule and greed cause war. Fellow believers could wage war, too. Godless countries can wage war too. But the fact is, all in the name of religions. It is the human's fault not religion. If you imagine the world will be peaceful without religion, you are wrong. The opposite will happen. War will become much worse. You're right. What does it mean? You're brilliant. - Let's go over there. - Let's go. What we deemed as simple apparently isn't that simple. Drinking tea, for example. The tea drinking tradition in China has existed for a long time. Around 4,000 years ago. Drinking tea in China contains lots of art. The art of pouring, serving, and how to steep the leaf. Offering tea is the form of honor. For us, we believe tea can maintain the yin and yang of human bodies. Pouring tea for other people is a form of apologize. Why do you apologize? What have you done wrong? I'm guilty, Ashima. Because since we parted ways on that bus, I wasn't looking for you as soon as possible. You're talking nonsense. - Should I drink this? - Please. There's a deep philosophy in every tea steeping. Enjoying tea will never be the same if we have experienced the real tradition. I'm a villager, Ashima. I come from one of the poorest villages in China. It's barren. Half of its area is arid desert. My parents worked as apple farmers there. One day, I was so angry at God. Due to a drought in my village, hunger and diseases were rampant in the village. - Where is your village at? - At... I will tell you if you promise to visit that place with me. Why? Because, I will only take a special person to my village. - Am I special to you? - If you give me your word. If God wills it. One more time, please? If God wills it. It sounds peaceful coming out from your mouth, Ashima. - Asma. - As-ma. Suit yourself. To me, you're my Ashima. What does it mean? I will tell you when the time comes. Okay, then. Write that down, then. Here you go. Nice. Don't give it back to me. Why? This book is for you. Yes, but you promised me to tell me the story of this book. You're right. I forgot. Okay. "In a village of Yunnan, there lives a girl named Ashima." Next week, he will take me to see Ashima's statue in Yunnan. He's taking you to Yunnan? It was so clear. Zhong Zhong thinks of you as her Ashima. Second, he wants to invite you to think about your future together. And, I think, he will ask you to marry him. He will propose to you. But you need to convince him to convert to Islam. Okay? I'll bring you a drink. Wait for a minute. I guess that's Ridwan. Could you answer the door? Okay. - Good evening, Ra. - Who is that? Sekar. Kar... What is Dewa doing here? Dewa isn't important anymore. Why should he come here? You guys have split up. You are already moving on. You need to remember. You have Zhong Zhong now. Ma... Don't you go out. Do you want to experience another heartbreak? Sekar, you're indeed my best friend but Jakarta to Beijing is so far away. I need to appreciate his effort to come here. You never replied to my e-mails. I haven't opened any of them. I didn't know what to say. Please forgive me, Ra. I have long forgiven you. I felt guilty for making your life difficult. Who said that? At first, that was true, but now I don't look miserable, right? I can't forget you. - My love is only for you. - You came so far just to tell me that? I will divorce Anita and marry you. I can't marry other people. Please give me a chance. Ra... I must go home. Shouldn't we eat first? I'm full already. Asmara. Thank you for the opportunity. Hey, Ma. You got a... Where do you want to take that flower? You want to throw it away? "Thank you for the opportunity." What opportunity did he mean? He asked for it. I never gave him any. You can't keep doing this. You need to be assertive. You can't be soft like this. Okay, please throw it away. Wasted money. Could have given it to someone. - Give it to Mr. Daniel. - Mr. Daniel? Asma. I got our tickets to Yunnan for next week. - Ashima statue? - Ashima statue. Ra... Where do you want to go? Let me drive you there. - Let's go, Zhong Wen. - Okay. Ra, come on. You said you were going to give me a chance. Let's go, Zhong Wen. - Ra... - Wait. Can you take us to Temple Love Heaven? Yes, I can. Let's go, Asma. Let's go. I'm Zhong Wen. Asma's guide in this city. I'm Dewa. Her heart's guide in Indonesia. Dewa... - I was just kidding, Ra. - Not funny. Do you still remember this song? It's our song. You were right, Ra. This song is really good for traveling. I like it. I was listening to it the whole day. The lyric was so romantic, it reminded me of the time we... You remember of this song, right? Ra? She is studying Mandarin. I know that. The song's really nice. This is the temple of Earth and Heaven. - Let's go. - Let's go. The Earth and Heaven temple. Earth represented by the rectangle building. Heaven represented by the circle building. This implies Heaven and Earth aren't separate. So it was wrong if there's a saying that tells there are differences among them. In the end, all of the differences could be united. I'm so sorry. I would like to interrupt. What's your religion? I beg your pardon. Your religion? Are you Hindhi, Buddhist, or Christian? You're definitely not a Muslim, right? - Are you an atheist? - I believe in the existence of God. I have my doubts about the religions. - Let's go there, it's almost evening. - Okay. Ra... Are you sure that food is halal? It's just chicken and vegetables. Stop complaining and just eat your food. I wasn't complaining, Ra. But he's not Muslim. The owner of this restaurant is Muslim, Mr. Dewa. Please try the food. The tea is the best quality around here. I would prefer coffee to tea. Could you help me to order some coffee? Sure, I'll do that. Wait a minute. What are you doing? He's not a servant. Do you like him? Don't change the topic. It's irrelevant. Of course it's relevant. I came so far to fight for something that was lost, that has gone away from my hands. Because of my own mistakes. I've told you that I won't get back with you again. Ra, I promise you... I will make you happy. We'll go anywhere you like, traveling, backpacking... Dewa! Stop trying everything to get us back together again. We're not the same individuals anymore. Stop expecting me to be the Ra you knew before. This'll be our last meeting. Please leave me alone. Just put your focus on your wife and your child. Asmara. Asmara. Ma, you got another flower. I know it. You will ask me to give it to Mr. Daniel, right? I don't want to do it. There's a card on it. Do you want to read it? "Dear, Ra. I know you're still mad at me." "You need more time to accept me back." "So I've decided to go back to Indonesia today." He has realized. Meaning... "...and I'll be waiting for you in Indonesia." How confident that guy is. - Sekar... - Yes, Ma. I know he didn't deserve. Now, why is he still... Asma! My goodness. Ma! Asma! Doctor, how is her condition? - There's something in her blood. - Is it dangerous? It's so dangerous. She could get a stroke and become blind. My goodness. - Sekar... - Yes, Ma? Yes. Is my illness severe? I want to go home. I want to seek treatment in Indonesia. How are you? How are you? How are you? Is Ashima there? Ashima left this for you. - Thank you. - Yes. "Hi, Zhong Wen." "Forgive me, I couldn't go to Yunnan with you today, because I have to go home to Indonesia." "There's an urgent family matters which I have to take care." "Let's put a pin on our promise." "The Ashima statue won't go anywhere, right?" "She will still be there until I came back to Beijing, right?" "Love, Asma." Ashima! What's wrong with me, Mom? What am I suffering from? Don't think about it, Asma. We're not weak women, Mom. Nothing should be hidden from me. Please, tell me. APS is "Anti Phospolipid Syndrome." It is a blood-clotting syndrome where the blood can clot anytime, resulting in blockages within those areas. There are two types of APS. Primary and secondary APS. For the secondary type, the syndrome can still be cured. As for the primary APS, the syndrome would stay forever inside the body. It can't be cured. Prevent blockages in specific body parts. If there is a lump in the eyes, it can cause temporary or permanent blindness. And women will experience recurring miscarriages. To prevent the next APS attack, we will help her with blood-thawing drugs. But to recover from the stroke symptoms, Asma needs to do physiotherapy so she can walk sooner. Hi, Ashima. Yesterday, I visited the Niu Jie Mosque again. I was thinking about your presence here, so I could ask you about lots of things. But, strangely a priest came to me and answered every question of mine which I wanted to ask you. He has introduced me to the friends of the Prophet Muhammad. Such as Mush'ab bin Umair, who leaves his luxurious life behind because of his great love of Allah. Hope your family matters are resolved soon, so you can come back to Beijing to meet Ashima. Love, Zhong Zhong... the name that Sekar gave me. ONE MONTH LATER Have you ever heard about the legend of Ashima from Yunnan province, China? We haven't, Sister. - Do you want to hear it? - Yes, we do. Please help me to reach the bench. "In a village in Yunnan, there lives a pretty girl named Ashima." "She wasn't only pretty..." "...but she owned such a beautiful heart." "Ashima falls in love with Ahei, a modest guy who lives in the village." "But, the chief's son, named Azhi, has tried to shake Ashima's feelings towards Ahei." "But Ashima wouldn't budge." "This has made Azhi furious. And he kidnapped Ashima." "Azhi created a big flood that drowned the whole village and its villagers." "Ahei tried to search for Ashima... but she was turned into a rock statue." "Since then, every time Ahei was longing for Ashima, he would come upon the statue and talk to the statue of Ashima." "He could only hear the echo." "That was the echo of Ashima's whisper of love to Ahei." "This was enough to retain Ahei's loyalty of his love... forever." What a wonderful story. May I see the book? "To me, you're my Ashima." What does it mean, ma'am? Try it. Good. Step on the stronger foot first. Okay, good. Keep it going, Ma. - Asma. - Sekar. Why not hug your overseas friend? - Move a bit faster. - A little bit more, Ma. Asma. Praise God. I'm so happy to see you. Ridwan will come later. He must finish his assignment first. He sends his love for you. He wishes you to get well soon. Amen. And then, Mr. Daniel... He sends you his love. He wants you to go back to China. - What is this? - It's from Zhong Zhong. Zhong Zhong knows that I will meet you in Indonesia. He wants you to read this letter. Does he know about my condition? No. I never told him. - What does it mean, Kar? - Let me see. - Ma... - What does it mean, Kar? It means, "I miss you every day." Finally I can go back home. I was so bored in the hospital. Yes, Ma. Praise God. - Sekar... - Yes. In my laptop, there is the unfinished draft of my novel, please read it. I thought you weren't asking me to read your novel, but replying to emails from Zhong Zhong. Forget about him, Sekar. Why do you want to forget about Zhong Zhong? What can he expect from a girl in this condition? You can't say things like that. You need to keep your spirit up. This is being realistic, Sekar. This is fair for him. I need to gather up my strength to be stronger, tougher, and willing to accept this all. What did he do wrong? Love's sorrow... will only weaken you. That's wrong. Love will make us stronger to face everything. We need love to live in this world and to face anything. Please don't think about it that way. Your Korean movies' theory is really chronical. Don't get me wrong. It's not only in the Korean movie, it's in our daily routines, in the Indian movies, in Hollywood movies. And Indonesian movies are also about love. Okay, try reading it first. HEAVEN IS NOT SORELY MISSED What's going on, Asma? I thought something happened. What's wrong with Asma? No, ma'am. I was reading Asma's novel. - I can't bear to read it. - That's why, Sekar, - write your own novel. - I'll ask for Ridwan's help. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. I wanted to see you for so long. I want to apologize for everything that was happening. I believe... Allah has slipped wisdoms and lessons from every incident. It's our job to figure it out. The problem is Dewa still couldn't forget you. I don't know what to do. I'm so desperate. There's one thing you need to know. My current condition... is much more serious than what you experienced. So, please don't worry... I won't take Dewa from you. "Let's slowly grow old together." That means Zhong Zhong... Dewa didn't know that you were sick? Take a good care of your child. Thank you, Ma. Praise God, I'm fine. I hope you're fine. Will you meet me in Indonesia? Nit... Anita! What is this? Why the divorce papers not signed yet? Come on, Anita. We've agreed on this. Why are you delaying our divorce? - Where to? - None of your business. Do you want to go back to Asma? At least I know that she's the woman I love. I took a pity on Asma. She won't live for long. What do you mean? You don't know about this? Asma is suffering from a strange disease. Her blood could clot anytime. Don't talk nonsense. Asma herself told me about this. She suffered from stroke, heart attack, getting paralyzed and the doctor stated that she couldn't have her own child. That's a lie. I'm sure you are lying. Why should I lie? To keep you from going away from me? - I don't want you to put hope on... - Enough, Nit. I said, enough. If you ever lie to me, I will never forgive you. Get out from this house! Get out! Pretty Asma. pretty Asma. Why are you blinking all the time? I don't know. My eyes hurt so bad. Perhaps, it's because of the mascara? Let me check it out. Why did you apply makeup on me? You're the one who wanted to meet Ridwan. It's been a month. You looked so pale. Now you look fresher and more beautiful. Peace be upon you. Ridwan has come. - Peace be upon you, ma'am. - And upon you peace. - How are you? - When did you arrive? Come inside. You look like a Korean movie star greeter, but Ridwan should act normal to meet you. You were right. That stiff human being will just say this, "My wife, you look a lot fatter." - That's predictable. - Right? - Sekar! - Yes, ma'am. Wait for a minute, Ma. Yes! - My husband. - My wife. Why do you look so fat? - You're losing control of what you eat. - Of course, I ate good food here. Her mouth is so rude. That's why I miss her. Why did you come alone? Didn't he come with you? Who should come with your husband? The one I was telling you about before. Asma's friend that... - Peace be upon you. - And upon you peace, Zhong Zhong. Asma, take a look, who does Ridwan bring with him? What's wrong with you? - Sekar. - Yes. - My eyes. I can't see. - My goodness. Are you joking? - Peace be upon you. - And upon you peace. Dewa... - I'm not with Anita anymore, ma'am. - Yes, but... - Is Asmara sick? - Sick? - Ridwan, come here. - What's going on? - Come here. - What's going on? - What's going on? - Asma can't see. Asma had another attack. Let's go to the hospital. - The taxi has left. I'll call another one. - Wait. - Who did you come here with? - With... - Zhong Wen. - Zhong Zhong, Ma. Zhong Wen? Why is he here? I'm so sorry. I asked him to come without asking you. Are you all right? He will be disappointed with me, Sekar. - What happened? - She had another attack. - My goodness. - She needs to go to the hospital now. - Let's go to the hospital. - My goodness. My goodness, Asma. Ashima. Zhong Wen. - Sekar. - Yes. Take me to meet him. Ra, it's me. It's me, Dewa. I split with Anita. The divorce is being settled. - Sekar, take me to him. - Yes. Ra... Peace be upon you, Ashima. And upon you peace. - Zhong Wen. - Yes. Is it true that you're a Muslim now? That's true, Ashima. - Ashima! - Asma! Please wait outside. Yes, sir. She is a strong woman. She won't give up against her disease. Please take care of her. How is her condition, doctor? We could save her vision, ma'am. Praise God. This attack is quite severe. It has attacked her brain tissues. She has passed her critical condition. But in the meantime, she is still unconscious. Please be strong, ma'am. Excuse me. Ashima. Zhong Wen is here. Ma'am. Yes, Zhong Wen? I would like to ask for your blessings. I would like to marry Asma. - But, she... - Insha'Allah, I will be ready. Asma has brought me towards the light. Allah's guidance is present through her. I want to be her husband, so I can be her light that guides her whenever she needs it. "In a village in Yunnan, there lives a pretty woman named Ashima." "She's not only pretty, but her heart is as beautiful as her face." Ashima. Praise God. Ashima, are you all right? Ashima. Nurse! Nurse! Ashima. There're damages in the brain tissues in Broca's areas. As a result, Asma will experience motor aphasia. What does that mean, doctor? - Asma won't be able to speak. - My goodness. I DON'T BELIEVE IN EXPRESS LOVE This wasn't an express love. Zhong Zhong had planned everything before he came to Indonesia. He understands the risk of marrying you. He loves you genuinely. HE WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED Why are you so selfish? You can't determine his feelings. He accepts you the way you are. I'm afraid, too. But the perfect love exists. A perfect love story doesn't need a perfect physical condition. You must believe that. I am afraid. But it wasn't about how I live my life with you. What I'm afraid of is... could I be the man who makes you happy? Guiding you to His heaven. You have always told me... that life is so simple if we could surrender to God's will. That includes the matter of death. Nothing can guarantee the healthy ones will live longer. When I read the Shahada sentence for the first time ever. When I surrender myself to His will... I finally understood what you meant. Everything is happening according to God's will. You're the medium of His guidance for me. That's why... I have the courage to ask you to marry me. Ashima, my light. Would you accompany me to walk our way to His heaven? Yes. Praise God. What did I tell you? Faith is the most important thing. Romance goes after that. - What do you say? - It's official. THREE MONTHS LATER Now I'll show you where I live. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you peace. - Zhong Wen. - Uncle. - How are you? - I'm fine. - How are you, Aunty? - Fine, how are you? This is Asma. She is my wife. Have me met before? Have you two met each other? Zhong Wen's uncle is a famous physician. He gave me traditional potion for three times a day to prevent my blood clotting. I haven't had a terrible attack for the last five months. Praise God. I have gained so much spirit to write articles during my stay here. With all the series of destiny from Allah... writing has therefore become enhancer of the Jariah provision. To add another kindness, if at any time I must return to face my God. Love is the biggest grace from Allah for humankind. If we wanted to feel it, love would be your amazing source of life's energy. Zhong Wen has fulfilled his promises, Mom. He took us to meet our love's legend. You have to be prepared for another magical experience for us. Love, Asma and Zhong Wen. This is the Ashima statue I mentioned. Ashima. Whatever... Whatever happens, my love for you will never fade away. It's the same for me. Ahei didn't need an answer from Ashima's statue. The echo from Ashima's statue convinced Ahei that their love is forever. Zhong Wen. Now, you're the head of a family. You must take a good care of your family. What's the matter, Aunty? You still don't know about it? Just tell him. Stop torturing him out of curiosity. - What's going on? - Your wife is pregnant. Are you pregnant? Praise God. You need to take a good care of her. Of course. We will make good medicines for her. You know the risk, right? You can have a miscarriage anytime. Yes. - Let's go inside. - Okay, let's go. Let's have a rest. THE BABY WILL BE AS TOUGH AS THE LOVE OF ITS FATHER AND MOTHER.
