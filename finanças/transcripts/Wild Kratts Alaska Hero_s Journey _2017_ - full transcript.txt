PBS KIDS OPENS WORLDS OF POSSIBILITIES FOR ALL CHILDREN. THANKS TO PBS STATIONS AND VIEWERS LIKE YOU. ♪ Wild Kratts! Chris: On the coast of the north Pacific Ocean and in the fresh water rivers that feed into it, there's a spectacular wildlife event. Martin: Hey it's us, the Kratt Brothers. I'm Martin. I'm Chris and we're talking about a creature journey like no other. It's called a salmon run. And this just isn't a fish story. This story includes lots and lots of other animals. There are salmon in this river. Mostly Chinooks and a few Coho. There are seven species of salmon in the world and they all make similar journeys. But today, we're focusing on the journey of the Sockeye Salmon in the rivers of the west. Chris: Like this one in Alaska. Every year, the salmon swim upstream, battling the currents and traveling hundreds, sometimes even thousands of miles, to get up to the very same rivers and creeks and lakes where they were born, so they can lay their eggs. Those salmon will encounter many obstacles along the way. Swift currents, dams and waterfalls. And there are a lot of other creature obstacles too. Oh, this current is so strong right here. How do the salmon do it? Uh oh. A waterfall ahead with bears! Now that means trouble for the salmon. Whoa!!! Imagine if we could join the salmon on their grueling journey full of surprises. Imagine if we had Sockeye Salmon power. Both: What if? ♪ On adventure with the coolest creatures. ♪ From the oceans to the trees. ♪ The Brothers Kratt are going places you never get to see. ♪ Hanging with their creature friends. ♪ Get ready it's the hour. ♪ Gonna save some animals today with Creature Power. ♪ Gonna go wild with Wild Kratts gonna go wild wild Kratts. ♪ Wild Kratts.

Martin: Looks like she's...yes, now! Whoa! Amazing!!! Got it, your turn. Martin: Orca Power!!! How was that one? Pretty good, right Swirly? (laughs) Yeah! Well Martin, you're still not getting the height that Swirly's mom gets. The adjustments that Aviva and I made to your tail fin should give you more than enough power to do it.. Chris: Wahooo! Fancy spins? Okay, that's not how Orcas do it. But it looked fun. Nice one, Chris! Hey thanks Martin. But I can't get... the height either. You wanna try Koki? Koki: Look, Aviva and I build the technology, you guys test it out. That's the deal. You need to keep up with the creatures, if we're going to learn about them. Now put a little more tail action into it. Like him. Okay. Like this? Koki: Yes! Now that's more like it! Leaping with Orcas in the North Pacific Ocean!! These cold water currents are full of life. Chris: Yup, plenty of food here to support all sorts of awesome marine animals. Sockeye salmon! Wait up. Hey, nice to meet you. Now what should I name you? (gasp) you'd better take off. There are hungry Orcas around! See what I mean? Hurry, hurry. Get out of here quick. Ah, nothin' to see over here. This way. Martin/Chris: Wahoo!!! Deactivate! Aviva's really on a roll with her inventing. Maybe I can finally cash in this Time Trampoline gift certificate. You know what she says, time machines are not easy to build. I know, but it's..worth a try... Aviva: I did it!! Oof! Oops. Chris! Remember the Christmas present I owe you? You mean this one that I keep trying to cash in? (humming) Is the Time Trampoline done yet? Not yet. Finished yet? Nope... Chris: Don't forget about this!! Ah, okay... I'm on it... Chris: Now, is it? No, it's still not done. Oh. Aviva: Remember, science takes time and trying to figure it out is part of the fun. But I am closer. Great! Whatdya' got? Yeah, let's see! It's a major breakthrough. It's huge! TA-DA !! Okay, not exactly huge. Yeah, I'd probably call it ...tiny. It's a Time Thruster. A critical part of the machine. Koki/Jimmy Z: Congrats Aviva! Martin/Chris: Wahoo! Chris: One step closer! Martin/Chris/Aviva/ Koki/Jimmy Z: Wah!!! Oh no!!! The Time Thruster! I dropped it!!! Martin/Chris/Koki/ Jimmy Z: What? !!!! Aviva: It's sinking. No!!!! My Time Thruster. It's attached to a salmon! We got to get it back! We'll take the Amphisub! Let's get salmon-sized! Miniaturizer ready. Martin: Miniaturize! Deploy Amphisub! Go find that fish!!! Chris: We're on it! Martin: There! The fish! He's up ahead! Chris: Hold up there pal. You've got something of ours. Wait! Where'd he go? ! Martin: I don't know. He disappeared in this big school. Oh I know her. Hey, did you happen to see a fish with a Time Thruster attached? No huh? Oh by the way, you still need a name. Hmmmm. Later bro. Huh? We gotta find that fish. Right. Chris: Ooops sorry. Didn't mean to bump you. Um...it sure is getting crowded around here. Martin: Yeah, what's with all these fish? ! There must be millions! Chris: Something is going on here. Martin: You thinking what I'm thinking? Chris: I think we're thinking the same thing Martin/Chris: A Salmon Run! Okay, I'm no fish expert, but I know salmon don't run. They swim. Chris: That's true, but a Salmon Run is when all these amazing fish leave the ocean to swim up rivers and lay their eggs. Martin: It's one of the most amazing journeys in all of nature. After years of fattening up on the rich food sources of the sea, they gather to journey hundreds of miles upstream. Oh no! This is way worse than I could have imagined. How do we find one fish in all of those? ! Getting that Time Thruster back just got a lot harder. We've gotta track these sockeyes on their journey until we find it! Martin/Chris: Oof... Chris: Sorry...just trying to blend into the crowd. Martin/Chris: Ah..oof... Martin: Please, you gotta help us! We really need to find a.....shark! What!?! No bro. The last thing we need right now is a shark. I know, but we got one! Martin/Chris: Ahh!! Salmon Shark!!!! Martin: Gotta get outta here!! Chris: Whoa! Koki: Uh-oh. I lost their signal. I gotta go down there. They need help! I have a feeling there might be some obstacles on this adventure. Aviva: Kratt Bros... where are you? Chris: Yikes. These Salmon sharks gather at the mouth of the river because they know the salmon runs are happening right now! Martin: And that means a feast for them. Look out! Chris: On it! Martin/Chris: Whoa... Now where are they? That's a lot of water. Martin: Our salmon friend. Follow her! Chris: All right. On my way.... whoa.... Martin/Chris: Aahhh!!!! MARTIN Whoa! Aah! Hey, it's you again. Whoa...shark!!! Chris: Martin!!!! Brother!!!! Ugh. Dry land. Guys, where are you? It's me Chris. The Amphisub is totaled, but I'm okay. And Martin? He fell out. I saw him riding a salmon towards the river. You've gotta find him quick. What about you? I'll get back to normal size and catch up to you. Hurry! Aviva: On it! Okay...uh-oh.. we forgot to take the Miniaturizer.. Hey, cool, this little gully looks kind of familiar. A Grizzly Bear cub! Of course. It's a Grizzly Bear footprint. Oof... Hea-vyyy!! Um, I know you're spending the summer searching for food and fattening up for winter hibernation, but you don't have to go around sitting on people. Aw, but I forgive you. You cubs have a lot of growing to do before winter, right bud? Mom's calling. Hey! If you're going where I think you are, I have a plan that just might work! Mind if I tag along? Aviva, come in. I need a Grizzly bear suit. Martin: Ahh, it's a little calmer here just inside the river. I really have to thank you again for saving me. Now I know the perfect name for you - Hero! Because you are one brave fish and you saved me. Hero, the sockeye salmon. And, you know what? I'm going to repay you. This journey you're taking is rough and I'm going to help you get home safely. I promise, okay? Koki: Okay Martin, we have your signal now, but we still can't track your exact location. Stick with that fish until we locate you. I won't let Hero out of my sight. It's my turn to save her. Any fish that can face a shark is pretty tough in my book. Oh yeah. And the obstacles are just beginning. Even here at the mouth of the river, the salmon need to look out for predators like... Stellar Sea Lion!!! Move Hero...move! Uh...see what I mean? Okay, maybe you can save me one more time. Then, it'll be my turn. Aviva: Remote cameras ready. Okay, now I can watch for the salmon that made off with my Time Thruster... and look for Martin... while I finish the Grizzly bear power suit. Whew! How's that for multi-tasking? Okay Chris, I think I've got all those differences between Grizzly and Black bears down now. You have that Grizzlies are bigger, heavier, and stronger than Black bears right? Aviva: Got it! Chris: That Grizzlies don't really climb, but Black bears are great at it and do it partly to get away from the bigger Grizzlies. Aviva: Check! Chris: That Grizzlies have a big shoulder hump and a rounder, dish-shaped face? As opposed to the Black bears longer, dog-like face with a straight nose. I covered that too. Plus the bigger claws of the Grizzly. Chris: Great, so even though Black bears can be brown and lots of different colors, they're a very different bear than the massive Grizzly. It's all in there. And the fur sample you teleported gave me all the DNA signatures I need. Ready to print creature power disc. Jimmy, ready for teleport transfer? Jimmy Z Ready to play ball! And....teleportation zap in. And....zap out!!!! Aah!!! Oh...seriously? Please don't sneeze, Little G. Got it! Insert Grizzly bear power disc. Touch Grizzly bear. And activate Grizzly bear power! Wow! I feel so strong... so powerful...and so, so.... hungry. You too? That's what I thought! This is working out exactly according to plan. Huh? Lead the way, Mommma Griz! Koki: Day 7 of Hero's Journey. We still don't know exactly where Martin is, but the salmon have logged about 126 miles and he's with them somewhere. Martin: I tell ya, Hero, it's impressive that you can survive going from salty ocean water to fresh river water. Most creatures can't do that! Do you realize how amazing you are? And you're modest to boot. Oof! Boot? Not that kind of boot. Wait..I know that boot! Aviva! Martin! There you are! Any sign of the Time Thruster? Not yet, but Hero is doing great so far. Even though it's all upstream from here. Yeah, well I'm working on a Salmon Power Suit, which might make everything a little easier. Awesome. Hear that Hero? Hero? Oh, you're figuring out which way to go, right? And You're doing it (sniffing) by smell! Aviva, she's sniffing her way home. Sniffing? ! Are we still talking about a fish? Martin: Yeah, salmon have a great sense of smell. Once they're in the rivers, they actually smell their way back (sniffing) to the lakes (sniffing) and little streams where they were born. Oh, she's going that way. C'mon! Ah, I think this will be quicker. (laughter) Okay, thanks Aviva. Uh-oh...I think we went the wrong way. Look! Martin: Yeah, I'd call that an obstacle. Aviva: An impossible obstacle!!!! Hero can't get past that! None of these fish can!!! Martin: But they're trying. Whoa!! Not impossible! Okay. That is so cool. Mind-blowing cool. Martin: An incredible display of strength and determination. And it's not easy. They miss and get washed back. But just have to keep trying. And not give up. Martin: It's a tough one Hero! About 7 feet. Close to max jumping height for a sockeye salmon. But you can do it. Whoa, what a leap! (gasp) Martin: C'mon. You can do it. Martin/Aviva: Yeah!!! Way to go Hero. You did it. Now that's what I call determination. (gasp) Martin, there's the fish with my Time Thruster. Oh no he made the leap! And he's going upstream! Go Aviva. Go, go, go. We gotta catch him! Koki: Day 14 of Hero's Journey. The Time Thruster escaped us again, but at least we know we're on the right track. I can't believe that Hero has traveled all this way - 252 miles - battling strong currents the whole way. The Tortuga's a much easier way to travel. And look at the obstacles they face!!! Orcas... Jimmy Z: Salmon sharks.... Koki: Sea Lions.... Jimmy Z: Waterfalls... Koki: I mean, what could possibly be next? ! C'mon Little G. You gotta keep up buddy. Oh, hoo hoo. Okay you got me! The river! Ah-ha, just where I thought she'd take us. It's the place to be, if you're a bear. Why? Because there are lots of salmon to eat. And watch, your mom has a different technique. Let's break it down. She gets right to the edge of the falls - where all the fish are leaping - she watches and waits for that perfect opportunity... and then.... BAM! It's a catch! Wow!!! See, you have to learn how to do that to survive. And if I can become an expert at it, I can stand at the top of the falls catching every fish that goes by until I find the one with our Time Thruster! Genius right? Okay, here I go. Just a few final adjustments and ...print! Ahhh, The Sockeye Salmon Creature Power disc. Mini sized for a mini Kratt brother. Wow! Thanks Aviva! Aviva: Test it out. Okay Hero. No more hitching a ride. I've got my own fins now. Insert creature power disc. Touch sockeye salmon. And activate Sockeye Salmon Power! Awesome! Made for the river. Oh yeah. Streamlined and powerful. And ready to fight that current! Let's go Hero. Aviva: Hey, wait for me... Wow. We're really covering ground now! Uh-oh! Another waterfall. And this one has bears! Oh we can do it Hero. Ready? Yeah. Whoa! Okay those look sharp. Let's get through here as quick as we can. I got this waterfall, Hero. I'm going for the jump... with Salmon Poweeeeerrrr! Ow...okay, okay that's way harder than it looks. I gotta try again. Aah!!! Wah!!! Aah!!! Urgh.!!! Aah!!! Aviva, you gotta put a little extra power in this suit. If the salmon can do it, you should be able to do it too. C'mon I thought you were the swimming brother. You're right. I am the swimming brotherrrrrrrr! Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Martin!! Sorry Momma Griz. This is my bro! Whew. Aw c'mon Chris. I would have made that jump. Yeah, you would've made it right into her mouth! Hey thanks for teaching me how to fish Momma G. Next one is all yours. Martin: Hey Hero! Yes, you made it! Chris: Yeah, it's awesome she did because some don't. Okay, that's way harder on foot. Hey Aviva. Meet Momma Griz! Aviva: Hi Momma Griz. Chris: And Little G! Little G? Little G? He's fishing. Aviva: My Time Thruster!!! Great job buddy! Hang onto him. Aviva: He got away! I got him! Awww I missed him. Don't worry, I got him! Martin: Aaaahhhh. Everybody is feasting on these fish! Yeah, but that fish is your brother! You gotta help Hero, Chris. I promised we'd get her hooooommeeee. Chris: Martin can deactivate when she lands, but you'd better go after him, just in case. Okay and one salmon power disc so you can follow that fish. Catch. Thanks. Aviva: Find that Time Thruster Chris!!! Chris: I'll try. Goodbye Bears! Hello Salmon. Activate Salmon power!!! Woo hoo. Hero's journey isn't over yet. Koki: Day 16 of Hero's journey. And let's just say, things are not exactly going swimmingly. Hey, thanks for the fun ride. I mean, those young eaglettes look hungry. But I'm not worried, because now, I just... deactivate. Uh..deactivate. Ahh, ohhhh!! Oof! Deactivate. Uh oh, creature power suit malfunction. Wait, nah, nah, nah, you don't want me. I'm really, kind of chewey, ugh! Ahhh!!!! Oooo, ahhh, ahhh!! Ahh, ooof, ah. Ooof, ooff. Ughhh... Uh, oh, gotta hide! Gotta...hide. Phew! Guess she'll just go back and get another fish. Huh? Pine marten's got a salmon too?! These salmon are feeding a lot of creatures. Haha, glad that Pine Marten isn't eating this Martin. Gotta...find...some...water.. Wow, even trees get fertilized by nutrients from the uneaten salmon. Gotta...flip...flop... to...water. ...flip, flop, flip, flop. River Otters, Black Bears, Shoreburn Seagulls. Wow, all these creatures depend on salmon. Hey, you're so important to this ecosystem. A hero in that way too, ya know. Woho, workin' the river. Alright, which way now Hero? You sure? Oh boy, I'm getting worried that we'll never find our time thruster. I mean, what are the chances that the fish with our time thruster, just happened to go this way too? Exactly, or that the fish has even survived the journey. I mean, bald eagles, pine martens, river otters. It seems like the obstacles are endless. Uh oh, speaking of obstacles, look, a hydro electric dam. There's no way we can get past this. Oh salmon pals, it's over. I'm so sorry I couldn't get you all home. The end of the line? But after all that? How can this be? Hi, it's Ava here. I know all about dams. People build hydro electric dams as one way to make electricity. But it's really bad for the salmon. A real sock in the eye, for a Sockeye Salmon. If the salmon can't get through, they can't lay their eggs. And soon... No more salmon. Thanks Ava. So I guess that's it. The end of the line. I'm sorry Hero. People are super smart. But sometimes, we don't think of everything. Hey, I think I see Chris Kratt. Chris, is that you? I'm glad we found you. We heard you were in trouble. Our town's dam has something special, look. A fish ladder, haha. This is fin-tastic. Guys, this way. Swimmable, jumpable steps. Oh, what human creativity. People thinking about creatures and solving problems. There are still lots of challenges to solve with dams and rivers, but by using our creature power, our smarts, anything's possible. And when I grow up, I'm going to be a scientist, and come up with an even better idea, for both energy and fish. Chris: We're off again, see ya. Good luck! Bye! Chris: See Hero? We told you we'd help ya out. Koki: Day 18 of Hero's journey. Still in search of a lost time thruster. I mean, maybe we'll have to face it, that we'll never get our time machine working again. I know, it's not looking good. But it's not over till the last salmon stops swimming Jimmy Z. Hero's still in it and so are we. Salmon can clock as many as 18 to 30 miles per day. Talk about a marathon swim. It's just so much space. What are the chances? Koki: Very slim, Jimmy. Very slim. Oh, where did that bald eagle go? Martin? Martin?! Oof. Ow, okay, now I feel like a Kratt brother. Whoa, oh. (laughs) Hey, Little Howler, it's you. Aw, my favourite little grey wolf pup. Oooo, that hover bike does not look good. How am I going to find Martin now? Aviva: And it's getting dark. Ohh, I'm really stuck sweetie. Where are you going? Flip, flop...ugh. This is an exhausting way to travel. Flip....flop. And not to mention, hazardous. Hey, what's that? The river, yes! Water, oh sweet water. Huh? Can't I catch a break? Easy. Sharp, canines you got there. Ahh! Wow, wolves who fish. River otters too! Huh, it never ends for these salmon. Except, this might be the end, for meeeee!!!!!! Nice den. Aw, are you offering me to sleep here? I can't do that. (laughing) Hey, give me that back, little toughy. You can't eat my helmet. Huh? Uh oh. Now there's something he can eat. Where are we? Huh? No wait, not that one. Ahhhh!!!!!! Ohh, my whole body hurts. We're bruised and battered. Exhausted and... what?! Am I seeing things? You look weird, all reddish, green. We're running out of energy and becoming food for scavenging nymphs. I may be next Hero. I just don't have any... strength left. I do like your colours, though. Hey, wait a sec, I'm not hallucinating. We're changing colours! Sockeye Salmon change colours before they breed. We must be getting close! Okay, I'll give it everything I've got. When the going gets tough, the salmon get going. Psst, Martin. Aviva. Oh, I think he's asleep. Good, ready? Yeah, toss me a line. When was the last time you heard a fish say that? Got it. Go Aviva. Whew. Ohhh... This is so humiliating. Caught ya. Very funny. Just as I thought, an eagle talon caused the malfunction. Okay, try it now. Deactivate. Ahh, now that's a relief. Now, we've got to get back to Chris and Hero, fast. Fast? Okay, you've got your vest. Insert disc. Both: Activate grey wolf power. Wolf power! (howling) Nice, now let's put that wolf running speed and stamina to use. Thanks for the help, wolf pack. Let's split. Koki: Day 23 of Hero's journey and still looking for Aviva and Martin. The obstacles continue to mount and this journey has now covered 414 miles! I'm amazed at what these salmon can endure. Hero, I love our new look. Full breeding transformation and the males with those awesome hooked jaws. But please tell me we're close. Now I know why only about one in 1000 salmon successfully complete this journey. It's tough. What? Are you digging my grave? I'm exhausted, but I'm not dead. Yet. Of course, you're digging your nest. This is it, we've arrived! You're home Hero! Wahoo, back to your birthplace. We did it! Koki: Woah, what did you say? I didn't say anything. She's digging her nest. That's how they do it. See? She makes a big depression in the gravel with her tail fin. It's called a redd, which means nest, in Scandinavian. Oops, sorry. Hero, I'll help you. Oh wow, this is fin-tastic. Woo-hoo! Jimmy Z/Koki: Yippee! Hurray! Get us down there, Jimmy. This is the final destination, and our last chance to find that time thruster. Righty-o. Rested and ready to roll. Here, fish with our time thruster. Where are you? Nothing. Uhhh. I guess we just came up empty, this time. Been running for days, and with all this wolf stamina, I still feel great. Owwwww!!! Ahh!! Woah!! Hello, little girl who cried wolf. Aviva! Good news is, we found each other. Bad news, I think that the time thruster is lost forever. (gasp) You mean that time thruster? Like I said, there it is. These sharp wolf eyes are on it. Don't lose that fish! Well Hero, I'd say we've done pretty well. The redd looks complete to me! Next up, lay some eggs, right? Chris, I found you! Hey. Oooff! Ooo, that was a rough entrance. The fish! It's here. I know she is. Hero just finished her nest. She did? Not Hero, the male! The one with the time thruster. He's here somewhere. Chris: re you sure? I haven't seen him. Aviva: He's here, I know it. Aviva: We have to look around for him. Come on, guys! Okay, hmmm. Hero! You did it!! Aha, see Hero? I told you we wouldn't let ya down. Oh sorry, I'll let you down. That's a beautiful redd you've built. Chris: With a little help from me. Oh look, she's on to the next step. Eggs, you're laying them. Martin: And he's fertilizing them! Hero completed her mission. Sure did. Hello, baby salmon, in there. Your mom did a miraculous journey for you. She's incredible! Should we tuck them in Hero? A little tail swish? Eggs all safe and cozy. Hey guys, what's wrong with Hero? Martin/Chris: What?! Oh no, she gave all she had to lay those eggs. Now, she's dying. Koki/Aviva: Dying? Why? All these salmon, even the one's that complete the journey, and lay their eggs, they all die. It's part of the life cycle of the salmon. But that's sad... Yeah, real sad. And just how nature works. We'll never forget you, Hero. But don't forget, her babies, the next generation, are safe here, in the river. They're the future of the salmon. But, that time thruster is the future of our time travel. We've got to find it. He's landing there? Not the greatest parking spot Jimmy. Ah, I can land 'em anywhere. Jimmy: Hmmm? Oops. Uh oh, she's stuck. I can't get lift off! Oh no, the Tortuga's blocking the water flow. And with no water, that means, the salmon are in trouble! And so are the eggs! Chris: They're gonna dry out! Ohh, this is a disaster! Deactivate! This is all our fault. All this generation and the next will die, if we don't restore the flow. This is bigger than finding my time thruster. We've got to rescue these fish! And all the creatures that depend on them. Chris: You with us guys?! Let's do this! All: With creature power! Activate grizzly bear power! Activate bald eagle power! Aviva/Koki: Activate grey wolf power! Yes, grizzly bear brawn and strength. Bald eagle flight. Aviva/Koki: Wolf power of the pack! All: To the creature rescue! Martin: Heading your way, Jimmy! Catch! Martin: Thanks Jimmy. Heave! Push! Grizzlies have the strength of almost five humans! Yee-haw! Yee-haw! Woo, nailed it! Aviva, Koki, all set! Alright pack, stronger together. Let's do this! Aviva/Koki: The power, of, the, pack!! The power of the Wild Kratts team. Never...giving... Upppppp! All: Woohoo! Chris: We did it! The river is restored! The salmon are saved. Ah, and Hero's eggs are safe. Martin: Aviva, look! Hey, my time thruster! I've got it. All: Woohoo, yes! Koki: Unbelievable! Aw, just like Hero, we never gave up. We just kept trying. And we did it! We saved the creek, the salmon, the creatures that depend on them, and so much more. And now, we won't leave your side, little Hero juniors. Chris: A few months later... They're here! It's happening! A newly born baby salmon. It's called an alevin. That's a little sack of food that'll last almost 50 days. I'll call you Hero junior. We knew your mom. Oh, she was a great fish. She taught us a lot. So now, you just hang out in this pool for a while, and grow bigger. Like this guy. He's learning to catch his own food already. I remember when creatures like that scavenging nymph, were feeding on the adult salmon. It's a healthy circle of life. Koki: And so, as Hero's babies grew, we continued our creature adventures and our inventing. Okay, the time thruster is in. Ready for a test of the time trampoline? Chris/Martin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! First, we'll send this can back, instead of you guys. Chris/Martin: Awww, no fair! 2 million years, back in time. Chris: Please work. And.... retrieve. Yikes! It got crushed by the time warp. Oh, glad it wasn't us. Uh huh. Awww, not another obstacle. Yeah, but hey, if science were easy, it wouldn't be so awesome. We just have to keep trying. Hero never gave up. And neither will we. Koki: And the following spring, one year later, Hero junior was ready to begin his own incredible journey, to the ocean. For Hero junior, the journey ahead is full of as many obstacles and hardships, as the one his parents took. Aviva: Once he gets to the ocean, he'll spend a few years getting big and strong, before making the tough journey back up the river, just like his parents did. Martin: But the salmon have what it takes. Maybe their greatest creature power is... determination. That never give up attitude. Chris: And that's what our friend, Hero the Salmon, taught us. Keep trying, no matter how hard it gets. It's the lesson we've learned, on Hero's journey. So, salmon are an unbelievable fish. Not only do they have the power to make an incredibly difficult journey, but they're also so important to the lives of hundreds of other creatures. Let's take a closer look at some of those other creatures. Like the bald eagle, a master salmon fisherman. When the salmon are running, bald eagles congregate, sometimes by the thousands. Then of course, the bears. Imagine if you were a salmon and you fight your way up to this point, you look ahead, and that's what you face next. A giant waterfall, with a bunch of bears around it. But, the salmon never give up. That's the salmon's creature power, determination! They fight till the end, and they go for it. These bears are each staking out their territory, their own fishing spots at the falls. There are a few techniques they use. Some of them wait at the bottom of the falls, for the fish to jump. The one's that don't make it, get washed back, bump into the bear and the bear can quickly grab them. There's also the technique of waiting above the falls, until that right moment where a salmon jumps, almost straight into your mouth. There are almost as many techniques as there are bears. The goal for these animals is to fatten up, on the bounty the salmon brings, before winter comes. One of the reasons the salmon all run at the same time, is because it's a game of numbers. There are so many salmon, all fighting their way up this river at the same time, that the bears and the other predators, can't possibly get every one. So, some of them will get through, and lay their eggs. Yeah, nice jump! So the life cycle of the salmon, is not only about this amazing, adventurous, powerful fish, that never gives up. It's also about whole ecosystems, of plants and animals, who rely on the food and nutrition the salmon provide. Oh yeah, salmon are heroes of the creature world. Keep on creature adventuring! We'll see you on the creature trail. To find out more about cool animals, and collect your own Wild Kratts creature powers, go to the Wild Kratts website, We'll see ya there!
