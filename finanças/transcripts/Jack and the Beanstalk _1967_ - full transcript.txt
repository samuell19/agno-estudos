Well, it's my business to know a little bit about everything and a great deal about nothing. Speaking of which, maybe we can do a little business. She seems to be nice and, uh F-A-T and probably very strong. [mooing] [laughs] Don't you try to fool a fooler. You're as strong as a horse which reminds me, some scoundrel stole mine. I wonder how she'd do in harness. But Maud's never been a horse before, mister. Would you be interested in a swap? Could be. - What'd you swap for her? - Mm. Well, for a cow that's just learnin' to be a horse let me see. I might offer a pint of purified whale oil a bowl of imported French gingham a box of Dr. Magruder's medicinal snuff. - Take your choice. - Come on, Maud-- Whoa, Maud. [laughs] I can see you're a wily trader, lad. You knew I was holding out but I don't possibly see how I can let you have them. Have what? [instrumental music] - Beans? - Magic beans. To bring fame and fortune to a boy and his poor old widowed mother. They look just like plain, ordinary beans to me. Now, Maud looks like a plain, ordinary cow but I believe she is a horse.

[mooing] [instrumental music] (Jack) But I outsmarted him, mother. I've got all seven beans for only one cow. Aren't they the prettiest beans you ever saw? Well, maybe not that pretty but who cares as long as they're magic. [sobbing] They are magic. He said they were. Please don't cry, mother. I know I was a stupid, little boy and I should be punished. Well, I'd just send myself to bed without any supper. [crickets chirping] [dramatic music] [leaves rustling] [cock crowing] [birds chirping] [instrumental music] Great day in the mornin'. It sure is, isn't it? What are you doin' up there? [cow mooing] You brought our cow back. - You returnin' her? - Ah, not me. I'm no Indian giver. I just wanted to make sure you weren't dissatisfied with the beans. Not me. Where do you suppose it goes? Yonder, perhaps. Betwixt, between. Maybe to fame and fortune. Who knows? You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna climb this whole beanstalk clear to the top. Let's go. [instrumental music] What do you suppose made it grow so high? Faith, probably. Is that anything like fame and fortune? (Jeremy) 'A little.' Land of Goshen. [laughs] If we ever find that fortune, remind me to buy a new hat. [instrumental music] Holy hot toad!

Oh, you're very pretty for a horrible harp. I thought only wicked witches could cast rotten spells like that. Some ogres have the black thumb, too. 'He has stolen all the treasure from the surrounding kingdoms' 'and also the precious goose that lays the golden eggs.' Well, at least he appreciates good music. Your, your voice is beautiful. - He stole all this? - Yes. But you're in mortal danger. You must fly at once before The Giant captures you. Fly! But where are we going to get wings? The goose who lays the golden eggs free her, and she'll take you. But you're captured, too. We can't leave you here. 'What do I have to do to release you?' 'Climb a glass hill? Slay a dragon?' Uh, wrestle a-a.. What? - Kiss me. - Kiss you? That's the charm to break the spell, a kiss. Well, considering it's for a good cause, I.. Jeremy, help! [coins clanking] 'Jeremy!' Not now, Ja..

If I was nimble, you wouldn't have caught me. Uh, Jack who fell down the hill with a lass named Jill? I hate girls. 'Well, you'd be too small for one bite' 'and not big enough for two.' What, pray tell, may I do with you? Why, give the lad a couple of gold coins and send him on his way. What? Another one? [dramatic music] And who are you? Oh, uh, just a Yankee peddler and his young assistant doin' the territory, establishing customer relations. And, believe me, it's a pleasure to establish relations 'with a gentleman of your taste.' [laughs] Jack, have you ever seen a more gracious giant? Gracious, no. (Jeremy) 'Ha ha ha, we're really touched' 'by your hospitality, dear Giant' 'but we do have a lot of territory to cover' before sunset. So if you'll kindly put us down.. Uh, well, a-alright.

You say you like gold and the finer things 'in life like gold dust?' Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, sir, Dr. McNulty's magic amalgam powder was made for you and here it is. - I don't see anything. - But of course not. I said it was magic, didn't I? Assistant, please. Help me with this pepper. Now, we take this worthless condiment and a pinch of the famous Dr. McNulty's magic amalgamate and there you have it. 'Ordinary pepper transformed into 14 carat gold dust.' Gold dust? Ah, it still looks like ordinary pepper to me. Take a closer look. [instrumental music] [sneezes] Where are you, you skulking knaves? Come out. No. No, don't come out. Hide. Hide. Hide, is it? The scoundrels were friends of yours, eh? Well, they may have escaped 'but ye shant.' Now, my little priceless while I deal with them I'll keep you safe under lock and key in the treasure room. [dramatic music] We must rescue her. But how? He took the key with him. Well, there's an old saying. "Love laughs at locksmiths." I don't get the joke. You will when you grow up. Come on, this way.
