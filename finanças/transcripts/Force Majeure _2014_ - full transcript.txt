WELCOME WELCOME SKI DAY ONE Okay? I'm keeping it open. They seem all right at home. - So, you have kids? - Yes, two girls. - How old are they? - Eleven and thirteen. - You don't bring them along? - Oh, no... I'm on a break from them! We're here because Tomas has been working so much. So now he has five days to focus on his family. - Right? - Wow... Good to know. - Have a great day. - You, too. - Hi. - Vera... Are you okay? Let's go. Could you help me? Did you go to the toilet? - Hey, I need help! - Then come along. Come on, Harry! - It's nice. - Yes, this is nice. The light and everything is perfect on the pictures. - Oh, his eyes... - He's very beautiful. These are good together. Like this. - What's her name? - Vera. - And his? - Harry. Are you tired? Are you? Are you tired? I was so proud of you on the slopes today. Please! - Could you grab those? - Sure. I got one. Hey, we're almost there. No... Not on my skis. You're an awesome skier. Tomas, no wonder he's like that, he hasn't eaten all day. - Daddy, do we get off here? - What? I'm just saying that it's not strange that he's tired. Yeah, well what should I say? - What? - Are we supposed to get off here? Yeah, up there. No, please... I'm getting off now. I won't get that. - Are you checking your phone? - No, I'm not, actually. SKI DAY TWO Harry, give me the phone. Thank you. - That looks great. - It really does... - Thank you. - Enjoy. Mine's delicious. Have some... Delicious. Isn't there any parmesan? What was that? Wow, check it out, Harry! - Tomas, isn't that an avalanche? - Yeah, but it's controlled. Look at that power! - Is it safe? - Sure, they know what they're doing. Daddy! - Doesn't look controlled to me. - Daddy! It's okay, Harry. Daddy! Tomas! - Tomas! - Daddy! Are you okay? Are you okay? How are you? Are you okay? Yeah... Everything's fine. We're fine. That's good. Where's Daddy? Just sit down, Vera. Wow, that was... Damn... Are you okay? They know what they're doing, but that was... Here comes the sun. Mom? - Wait, Mom. - Mommy?! - Jesus, Ebba, wait! - Go inside. Go on... Vera, go on! Inside... What? - Harry, go inside. - What are you doing?! - Somebody's in here. - Go on in... For goodness sake, Harry! Go inside and let us talk. Well? You seem irritated. Well, are you? No. Good... Should I be? No... I don't think so. No... No. Maybe we should go inside. Oh, hello... Sorry... Not much skiing today. Yes... Later we will... - Bye-bye. - Thank you. Bye. Hi. Leave me alone. Ah, are you angry? What's up, Harry? Hi there... Are you all right? Hmm? Hey, talk to me. Stop it! You know, we have to talk in private once in a while too. Huh? - Do you want to talk about-- - Go away! I know you're angry, but can't we talk about what happened? I can see that you're upset, but... I'm sorry that we... - Come on... - Go away! I'll take that screen away! Watch your tone of voice! Go away! Aren't you listening? Go away! - You too! - We're going. - We'll be back in ten minutes. - No! - You're not the boss, Vera. - Go away! - Thrown out of our own room? - Yup... What are you laughing at? ' Hey... . Yes? Right, good... Great, you're in control. - Should I catch it? - Can I try? No, guess not... Wow... - You've never done this before? - No, Ihaven 't. - You've been practicing... - It's my first time, Ipromise. - Liar. - N0! Your nose is getting longer... Pinocchio! - Hello, darling. - Hi, sweetie. Good? So, how was your day? Um... It was fantastic. I had a great day. I met this one. I mean... yeah. Yeah, I mean we bumped into each other this morning at the queue to the lift. And I guess we were both longing for someone... Just kidding. No, we had a great day. Good snowboarding and really nice talks. You told me that you're very religious. - I... didn't say that. - Yes, you did. Not that I'm very religious, no. Yeah, you did. It's all right. What's wrong with that? I told... "this one" that I'm not an atheist. Excuse me? Who the fuck is "this one"? You said it before. - Did I? - Yes, you did. "I met this one..." It's a joke. Anyway... Did you guys brave the crowds today? Um... - What did you say? - "Brave the crowds..." There were a lot of people on the mountain today. So I meant, "Were you brave enough to get out there?" Yeah, it was great. It was great, we skied all morning... ...and actually, we went home after lunch, because we had some kind of experience, actually. Well, we were sitting at the top restaurant, with this magnificent view... It's a nice spot. And they had a... Yeah, we saw an avalanche. - An avalanche? - Really? No shit! Yeah, but I mean... Sorry, it just sounds very strange when we say it in English. "An avalanche." - What should I say? - No, it's... No, anyway... We're sitting there and it was... It was, like, a controlled avalanche. So, it was... A controlled avalanche, yeah... But quite quickly it grew kind of big. I've never seen such a big avalanche. And it was like... For a moment it looked like it would... - smash into the restaurant. - Wow. It was quite shocking. Yeah, when I talk about it I still get these goose bumps. - What did you do? - There's not much to do. It was horrifying, actually. - It scared you? - Poor thing. - Kids are all right? - Yeah, everyone is fine. You got a bit afraid, but it wasn't that... It was controlled and they know what they're doing... He got so scared that he ran away from the table. What? No! I did not. - No, no... - Come on. No, no, no... You ran away from the table. What? No, I did not. Yes, you did. Oh, okay. No. I did not. When it came at us, you ran away. No, I didn't... I most certainly did not do that. - Yes. - No, no, no... You grabbed your phone and your gloves, and ran like hell away from me and the kids. Huh? Please... I did no such thing. That's not how I remember it. - Okay, how do you remember it? - Not like that, anyway... You ran away from me and the kids. Ebba, please. I didn't do that. Is it even possible to run in ski boots? Come on! Yeah, I think we're still, like... under the influence from it. It's kind of shaky. Can you not run in ski boots? What? Can you not run in ski boots? I mean... Tomas says you cannot run in ski boots. It's ridiculous! But isn't this a situation that kind of comes really quick? How do you know how to react? You cannot run in ski boots? Not "run" run... No. You know, I haven't skied in years, so I suppose I'm really not the person to ask. Oh shit... This is... Lovely, lovely. Shall I take your wine? Hey... What's going on? Hmm? This isn't us. I don't recognize us at all. - I don't recognize you... or myself. - I don't recognize you either. - I don't want it this way. - No... I'm still shaking after that godawful dinner. - Try to hug me... I need one. - So do I. What the...? I'll turn it off. A nice big hug, all right. It's just... It's so weird that you won't admit what happened. What's so weird about having different versions? I can't "admit" to your perception, that's not how I see it. I really can't relate to your description. And the way you tried to convince everybody at dinner that your version was... The important thing is that I don't want us to be like we were tonight. Right, it was embarrassing. It was terrible! - Shit... - It's no good... - That's not us. - No... I want us to share the same view... Are we back to that? Are we back to "a shared view"? I think it's good for the kids. And for us. - What exactly is your view? - Listen to me... If we could agree that there was an avalanche and that we were frightened, but that everything went fine. I'm totally okay with that. Is that what you meant? Sorry... A unified front. Sure, I'm okay with that. All right, then. The two of us experienced an avalanche. Christ... We're on holiday. We shouldn't be acting like this. Let's put all this behind us. There was an avalanche, we were terrified, but everyone's fine. Okay. Good... WEATHER FORECAST AT ALTITUDE SNOW/CLOUDY Do you have the key card? We have an audience. Ask for some privacy. - Can we have some privacy? - What do you want? Can we please have some privacy? We're just having a talk. Please? Yes? Hi. - Are you awake? - Yeah. SKI DAY THREE Harry... Your other mitten is out here, over by Daddy. What? The other one's over there, next to Dad. I was thinking about skiing all by myself today. What? I think I'd like to ski on my own today. - Unless that's a problem? - No, no... Do I hear a "but"? No, go ahead. We'll catch you later. Yeah. What? Mommy wants to ski on her own. - I don't like that... - Of course she can. She can use some "me time." I'd like to ski on my own too, if that's possible. Take my credit card. No, I'll be fine. I'll use my own. Hey, watch out! Give us some warning next time, yeah? Say "bar down" or something. - You okay, hon? - Yeah. Check out the dogs. And not just the dogs... Hello, darling. He's great. - "Italian stud"? - Italian stud. At least he speaks English... As much as we need. Well, that's the truth. You seem to have had a lot of men? I guess that's right. Yeah... Do you have an arrangement with your husband or boyfriend? No way! We each take responsibility for our relationships. That works out pretty well. Wow. - You look surprised. - Well, yeah... Aren't you everjealous? And what about him? If he has a good time with some woman, why shouldn't I let him have it? You actually mean that? That you're happy he's with someone else? Sure, I'm happy for him. To a certain extent, I understand. You're still young and pretty... But aren't you afraid of being alone, being left? Sure, being left is not appealing. But there are lots of people who are important in my life, not just my husband and my children. I can't go building my entire self-esteem... on being a woman in a relationship or being a mother. Okay, I get that, but still... Does it actually work? Are you sure no one gets hurt? Are you sure that it doesn't hurt your children? I'm just like any other responsible parent. I do my best for my kids, trying to make them feel safe and happy. I'm convinced they're doing just fine. And I'm doing fine, which is important. Yes... That's the best thing I can do for them. Okay. Listen... You must agree that building a relationship with another person, spending your life together, getting married, having kids, that's worth so much more than tumbling around with "Alberto Tomba" at some hotel in France? Can't you agree to that? Why do I have to choose? I have both. I have long-term and short-term relationships. It's like a provocation, you do realize that? I can't believe it's as easy as you make it out to be. Well, I don't know... No? - Seriously, Ebba... - I'm trying to understand. I'm trying to understand. This isn't the right place to discuss this. - Let's do it some other time. - Sure... - Calm down. Cheers. - Cheers. Stop, Han')!- Harry, wait! Hey! What's going on? What? What if you fell? It's really dangerous. What's that? Speak up. Tell me what's the matter. Go on. Don't mumble. I'm afraid that you're going to divorce! Wait down there, Vera. Vera! Come on, let's go. Here, feel this... - No one can see us... - No. Two minutes... Come on. Please? Don't go... Come to Papa! Welcome! You've been here before, right, Fanny? It's my third season. But it's the first time I'm here with Mats. It's been fun. We've had a great time. That's nice. - How's it been for you guys? - Well... It's been... We've had a fantastic time. It's been great. A great place to bring the kids. The conditions are great, all this snow... And I had a day of skiing on my own too. - You should have that too. - I'd like that. It's wonderful to go at your own pace and just... Wouldn't it be nice for you boys to ski together again? That would be cool... It must be ages since you skied together! - Right... - I think you should do it. Let's see... How about tomorrow? I can take the kids. Don't feel guilty about it. Well, I was thinking that this is their vacation. I'm sorry... Sorry about that. I didn't mean to take control of your vacation. No problem... This is delicious. That's nice... They said they were opening a night club. So I went there and asked if they were hiring... I talked to their head bartender, a guy called Micke. And he was kind of threatening. - What do you mean? - He fronted me... - He was aggressive? - Yeah. He was all like, "So, ever worked a bar before?" - And I went, "Yeah..." - "Are you any good?" We were... He kept going on about their concept... We were in an avalanche the other day. What was that? I said, we were in an avalanche. You were actually in it? Go on... We're here, so everything's okay. But... The thing is... we were about to have lunch and had just been served... when we heard a loud bang. You hear that all the time around here. I don't like it, but Tomas says it's nothing to worry about. Anyway, everyone at the restaurant turns to have a look. We see the snow start cascading. And I mean, it's spectacular. People start taking pictures. And so do we. We pose Vera and Harry and snap away. It's quite... impressive. Until we realize that something's wrong, because this wall of snow is heading... straight towards us. - It's heading towards you? - That's right. Yikes! And it keeps getting bigger and bigger... Suddenly, it's clear... That now something's terribly wrong. Everybody panics. They start running and screaming. It's total chaos. The wall of snow is like 50 meters high and 100 meters wide. And it's moving so fast... So I grab Vera and Harry... And I try to pick them both up. But I can't. So I look for Tomas, to help carry the kids to safety... And what I see is my husband grabbing his gloves and his phone... and running like hell away from us. Then everything goes white. I'm standing there with the kids... There's this intensity and these sounds, like nothing I've ever known. And I'm thinking that this is... And I call out to Tomas... But he's not there. I don't know how long it all went on. Um... And then... there is no avalanche. That fog closing in on us was only avalanche smoke. The actual avalanche came to a stop before reaching the restaurant. There I am, clutching my kids, and suddenly the sky is blue again! Our lunch is still on the table... People start coming back... and realize that there was no fucking avalanche. I don't know what to do, so I sit down and eat. Then Tomas comes back... We don't say a thing, just eat. Right... So now I have a problem... Here I am in this fancy hotel, and I'm not happy. It's no good, I don't like it here. Tomas, say something! This is freaking me out! When... When there's... In situations like these, you're not always... aware of what you do. You try to survive. But when you're in survival mode... He might not be able to live up to his values. And all... Fine, but afterwards you need to own up to it. - Admit what you did. - But didn't...? What are your thoughts, Tomas ? It's the third time he asks. So could you please say something? What did we say about flying this indoors? Jesus Christ... You've got to say something. Sorry about that. That's Tomas' latest toy... Great... Are you guys OKaY? Sure, we're fine. So, should we leave? Should we go, orjust stick around? We should... - They need... therapy. - Shh, shh. Sorry about this, but we couldn't talk about it. I think it could be good for you both... to try and see all this in a wider context and in a more forgiving light. If you look at us human beings... and animals as well... the fact is, that when we are confronted by an extremely dangerous situation, it triggers a force in us called "l want to survive!" That means you react now! It's... It's a primitive force to just escape. And I believe... That the "enemy" is the image we have of heroes. All those stories about heroes. And the pressure to be a hero and do heroic acts in terrible situations. But the truth is when reality is staring you in the face, and you're afraid to die, very few of us are heroic. Just look at the Estonia. Eight hundred and fifty people died on board. Only 137 survived. And these people... they trampled on dead bodies. They knocked down children and old people. They did terrible things. Then they had to live with what they had done. But you can't punish them for those crimes. I can't identify with anyone who would trample on their own kids to survive. No... That's not what this is about, not to me. My problem is that my natural focus is on my children. They're too little to fend for themselves. While Tomas' natural focus is away from us. But you need to take into account everything Tomas is. Everything he's done for you, how much he loves you and the kids. He had a split-second reaction. If a drunk stormed in here and attacked you with a bottle, I would have punched him, even though I'm not violent to my nature. I'm not a violent man. But you don't really know what you would do. You were terrified when... I'm going back to the others. It's... interesting when things like this happen. I guess we were shocked that it could happen. That our perceptions of the situation are so different... I didn't realize... that you saw it like that. You didn't tell me. Then could you please share your experience with us? But it's... It's not really relevant how I perceived it. Though it's obvious that the experience was very dramatic to you. So you're not on board with the version Ebba just told us? No. No? I don't share that interpretation of the events. I don't. You are entitled to your own point of view. But I don't share it. We've got it all on film. Hmm? It's there, on your phone. Let's just watch it. Would you like to see it? - I think we've had enough. - No. - I really... - I'll go get your phone. - Obviously, it was scary... - I understand. But we're all here. Harry and Vera are... okay. I'd like you to see this. To finish this... I really need to do this. All right? - Okay. Go ahead. - Good. Are you all going to look...? Here... Here it comes... That's us at the table... You're filming, right? Daddy! You can clearly see someone running away here. Do you agree? Do you all agree? We even hear your boots clattering. I agree that it looks like I'm running. Good. Tomas, maybe you were thinking... In an avalanche situation, it's pretty tricky to get out from under the snow... So maybe you planned to go back and dig them out? Just like when cabin pressure drops in an airplane, you learn that parents should put their masks on first before they put one on their kids. So you actually did the right thing for a situation like this. That was what you were thinking, right? Wasn't it? - Mm. - Holy shit... I wonder how I would react if you did that to me. Right... You might have run too, left your kids behind... You don't know. No one can be sure of anything like that. No... Well, you might also have run. But we're talking about you and Tomas. Why? Because I think I would react just like Ebba, I wouldn't be able to run. So you mean there's a difference between men and women? No... I mean... Well, like this... You and Tomas are the same kind of man. If you compare the two of you with, say, Filip... Filip would never run away, never abandon his family like that. Nevefl So Filip, who is 21, still living with his parents, and who doesn't have any kids, that he would defend his family but I wouldn't? Hypothetically speaking. There's a huge difference between your generation and ours. Like there's a big difference between you and your father. You take on more responsibility for your kids than his generation did. So, hypothetically, it's more probable that Filip, a skinny little guy, would protect his family, compared to me because I was born in the 70s? Fanny, I have always taken care of my family. I've always made sure that they were very well taken care of. - So where are your kids? - You know that. And your ex-wife? - In Oslo. - Right... You say you do everything for them, but she's taking care of them right now. While you're on vacation with a 20-year-old girl. Is that a problem? No, but I can see that your ex might think so. Third floor. SKI DAY FOUR What's the matter? Nothing. Couldn't you just... Couldn't you just stop thinking about it? Ijust... I'm just wondering what I... have said or done to make you think... You didn't say anything. Listen... You haven't said or done anything. It was just hypothetical. I know that you would do anything to protect your family, I really do. And I really believe... you would make an effort to protect me if anything happened. Yeah, but... Just drop it and get some sleep. Do you mean that, or do you just want to get some sleep? Because I mean it. I do. So good night, let's get some sleep. Don't think about it anymore. No! Please don't talk. I wasn't going to... Just close your eyes. Are your eyes closed? Breathe... Hey, what's wrong? You can't say you didn't mean it, because you said, "l wonder what you would have done." "And it's more likely that you would run away than Filip." Filip, for God's sake! I'm guessing you're drunk and tired and now you're stuck in some mode, I don't know what it is. What if I said to you... If I said you're the kind of woman... "Lots of women can't have kids and I think you're one of them." "You are a woman who can't have kids." "You're not female enough for that." Okay! Then I'd say, "That's too bad! Good night!" What if I said to you... If I said to you, "l think..." Hey, listen to me! If I said to you... There's nothing on your mind that you haven't already said. - But do you understand... - Jeez, yes! I get it. And now... we'll leave the subject for tomorrow. Good night. Let's get some sleep. I need to know that you trust me. Don't ignore this, it's very important to me. I trust you, okay? Why are you covering your-- I can't take this seriously anymore. We've been going on for hours. Please... Shit... I trust you, okay? Could we please get some sleep? You're insane... No wonder your wife wanted a divorce. What did you say? What did you say?! What about you? - Huh? - Done a lot of skiing lately? No. In the past few years... it's mainly been with the family. It's really bright out... Okay. Okay. Okay. - Ready? - Yeah. Okay. It's perfect! It doesn't get any better than this! Aren't we going skiing today? Hey... Wake up! Aren't we going to ski today? - Ski? - Yeah. Yeah, maybe we should... You smell like wine. Mommy, can we have ice cream? Can we have some ice cream? - I guess... - Me too! Hang on - breakfast first. - We've already had breakfast. - Yeah, a long time ago. Yogurt and an egg. All right, go have some ice cream. I want chocolate. Where's my phone? That was an awesome run! That was great. Let's try the other side next. I don't think I want to ski anymore. What? Are you okay? Can't we just talk instead? What do you want to talk about? I'm not sure... Hey... Are you feeling all right? Maybe you should try screaming? Huh? Seriously. I spent two years in therapy... and it didn't do a damn thing. Then I screamed for five minutes and felt a hell of a lot better. It's physical, something stuck in your body. I mean it. Nobody can hear you, so go for it! I'm supposed to sit here and scream? On the count of three. One, two, three... Good. From the depths of your belly! - One, two, three... - No, forget it. Come on! For real! Yes. Do it for real! Damn it!!! Fucking hell! Good! Hello, guys... - Are you having fun? - What? - Are you having fun? - Yeah, sure. Great place. Yeah, yeah... I just came to tell you that my friend sitting over there... She thinks you're the most good-looking man in this bar. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good time. - You too. - Cheers. Excuse me, I had to come back again... Uh-huh? I made a mistake... She didn't mean you. She meant someone else, my friend. She didn't mean you. - Okay. - I'm sorry, it was my fault. - No, it's fine. Thank you. - Just have a good time. Listen, it was my fault. I'm really sorry for this. I was actually pointing at someone else, so... - Let's go. Take it easy. - But just... don't worry. Are they putting me on? Hey, hey, hey. - Hello... Are you funny? - No, no. Think we're funny? What? Did we do anything? - We just came to apologize... - Yeah, yeah... Take it easy. I didn't talk to you! I didn't fucking talk to you! "Hello..." Hi, it's me, Tomas. I'm at the hotel. Where are you? It's 7:15 pm. Damn it... Why are you out here? Were you inside? Is something wrong? I've been looking for you everywhere. Where were you? I called. I sent a thousand texts... We've been here and down at the pool. Could you hang on, Andrea... Daddy's in the hallway. Daddy, there's no network. - What? - There's no network. I see... I'll check it out. Ebba? Yes. Exactly... Yeah... Sure, I understand. You've been in a relationship for five years and you feel like... playing around. He understands that, right? Hang on, I need to talk. No, continue... Listen, I'll call you back. Great. Bye. Hey... Listen... Hey, you... Daddy, it's still not working! - What isn't? - The network. Okay, um... It's not working. Do you have to spread your stuff out all over the place? No! Are you coming? Just pulling on some leggings first. Do you have the key card? You're just pretending. What? You're not crying for real. Hello? No, maybe I'm not. Christ! Ebba, Ebba... Come here. I get it that you're disappointed in the person who materialized. I'm really disappointed in him too. I hate him... I hate him so damn much. And I... I can't forgive the guy... He's done other stuff before this, too. He has... He's lied. He's been unfaithful. Yes, he confesses. He cheats at games when he plays with Harry and Vera. He's so goddamn pathetic. And I can't live with him any longer. I don't want to. You're not the only victim here. I'm a victim too! I'm a bloody victim of my own instincts! Tomas. No, I can't stop... Please, let's go inside. Let's go inside. Shut the fuck up! Calm down. Can't you just... Sit down. Sit. Now you need to pull yourself together. Look at me... Look at me. Breathe. Breathe. Tomas, please... Breathe. Tomas, you'll wake the kids up. You'll wake the kids. Good Lord... Tomas, please calm down. Daddy? Don't worry, Harry. Daddy's just a bit sad. He'll be fine. - Mommy? - Everything will be fine. Daddy? Daddy? What's the matter, Daddy?! He's sad. It will pass. What's wrong with him? Daddy? Daddy? Mommy! - Come on. - Mommy, come here. Come here, Mommy. Come on! Daddy's sad, that's all. It will pass. FINAL DAY Yes? Are you sure this is safe? Sure, the run is marked out. Well, we can't see a thing. I'll go first and check it out. Good. Okay, Harry, come on. Then Vera. And you go last, Ebba. - Are you okay? - Yes. It's a nice run. But it's foggy and windy, so stick together. I'll lead off and you follow close behind me. If I stop, I want you to stop up mountain to me. I might be stopping before a dangerous spot. - Good. - Good. Let's go. - Everybody okay? - Yeah. - Take it easy. - Just follow the sounds. I'll show how we're going to get down. Mommy? Ebba, can you hear me? Are you there? What? Help! I'm coming, Ebba! Crap! Wait here. Ebba! I'm on my way, Ebba. Don't move! I'm coming! Daddy? Daddy...
