IF THEY TELL YOU THAT I FELL A VICENTE ARANDA FILM. BASED ON THE NOVEL BY JUAN MARSE. Due to the climate of misery and scarcity of the time, the 'aventy' was a cheap and accessible way to escape for street children but undoubtedly was also a memory reflex of a disaster, a deadened echo of the clamour of the battle. – Good morning! – Hello! - Don't forget tomorrow's meeting. - See you later! Even the ass is leaking water. Now people are drowning in winter. These guys were diving in a car, 200 meters below. You should respect the dead and don’t smoking in here. Stop your gibberish, sister! Doctor Maleta insisted he wanted them clean as silver… So, you know now. Doctor Maleta pretends to care much about things, but he’s really capable of eating a liver with hepatitis. Now give me a voucher for detergent, sister. It ran out yesterday. How much? - How much, Nito? - My, my, my! Sister, ask for water of roses too. Do you know who’s the deceased? Daniel Jabalolles. You remember Jaba, don’t you? It’s nine o’clock, boys. Soon, the garbage collector will be here and granny will appear with her bunch of junk. - Your turn, Luis! - Slime! Muck! Filth! Shit! Hey! Wait! You know very well it’s not garbage. They’re pieces of paper folded over and over until giving them the form of a bird… or a dove or something like that. Little female birds. It’s a crazy thing. The work all night. If they paid you a coin each, you were rich. But you see, they are discarded by morning. They’re worthless. Little female birds. It’s a work of idiots. For hundreds, thousands. Does the granny make them? She isn’t insane. Then it must be Jaba who went crazy! Jaba has good hands to jerk off, not to make paper figurines. He masturbates; he doesn’t make little paper birds. The key of the mystery, the solution to the puzzle… Come on! Tell us! They have a priest locked up from the war. They haven’t told him that the nationals won. Oh, come on! Sarnita, if you don’t come back soon, I’ll go to the jewellery! So what? Today is Thursday and I’ll get my first salary on Saturday. You’re nuts! Tomorrow I'll deliver some jewels for a lady at the 'Richi'; my father says she is the mistress of a black marketeer. Your father is nuts too. - Should I help you? - Maybe to fall. Do you know what the boys say? That you have a Russian pilot hidden in the cellar. You're always telling 'aventis', Sarnita. You'll end up crazy. I would say it’s rather a woman. A bitch you hire every night from Chinatown. It’s for the cat. We haven’t seen the cat for more than a month now. In case it decides to comes back. Cats don’t eat with a spoon. Enough of your nonsense, all right? I’m swamped with work. Help me. Now leave me alone. Go tell 'aventis' to the boys. Come on! Tell us! What did you find out? From now on boys, danger will lurk from everywhere. They say she was a spy that knew too much. Because she was a whore of the worst kind. Now pay attention, because I’ll tell you an aventi that will happen tomorrow. At four, Jaba has a date with the scarred bitch. Juan!… Juan! You’re early, come in. What’s your name? Daniel. You? Ramona. They told me it was going to be a kid. Who lives here? I only know the housekeeper. Have you been here many times? Yes. -  Do they really pay what they say? -  Yes. How old are you, darling? I’m old enough to fuck you. As old as your father. Look. The deal is that the show must last al least one hour. That’s too much. If you want, leave everything to me… All right? Is he here yet? I don’t know. But, must he see us? Leave it to me. I know how he wants it. He is watching us… Don’t look! What’s wrong with this one? It’s injured. What do you carry in here? A son of hundred milks. Lay down, Quickly! Like this? It must be on the floor. Now, bite me, breath loudly; scream if you want a hot fuck, baby! It must seem real! Fuck! We’re like a couple of new sweethearts! Wait! Ah! No! Not there! Not That! No! Don’t pretend to be tight! You know very well it’s not the first time! There! That’s what you want, little bitch! Why the fuck did you bring me a miserable employee? Because the worse is yet to come! Kill me! Kill me! A woman. Who could she be? One of those girls from the orphanage. Sure. He used to like one of them. What was her name? Come on! Let’s operate! This one likes tomato. Luis, the sweet potato! I don’t fell her heart beating. Doctor, touch it! Touch it! We must open up right now! Scissors! Juanita. Her name was Juanita. She loved to play doctor. If I told you, sister. I don’t want to hear it. You were such a pigs! I just wanted to tell you about our enthusiasm to tell aventis. An innocent and cheap game. My god! It must be the tumos! - Anastasia! - Anaesthetic, donkey! Doctor, come here and touch it! Scissors! Easy, Juani, it’s nothing. Just like a dry shave. But don’t worry, it’ll grow again. Who’s worried, fools? I won’t give you that pleasure. Hairy girl! If you cut a single hair, I’ll grass you up to the troops. You are warned, Juani! So, you better talk, sing now, or you’ll feel the red-hot iron. She’ll spit out everything she knows. But she wants to taste the sweet potato first… Just the tip. I know her very well. Bring the sweet potato now. You’ll have to tell everything. You’ll see what’s good. Doctor Jaba’s going to operate you. We’re going to shove the sweet potato up your ass. Is it true that a Moro nailed you, right in front of your father? I was anxious to see you. What do you want to know? What are you looking for? Untie her. I just want you to tell me one thing… the former principal you had at the orphanage what was her name? I don’t know anything. I arrived to the house two years ago. The Moros had already invaded my town. When they brought me, miss Mois was already here. But, have you heard about her? No! When you smell something’s burning, your hut will be on fire, Juani. Have you heard about her? I bet you do. The lady doesn’t want us to talk about her. Surely someone knew her, but we are not allowed to name her. Why? For something bad she did once. Besides, they say she’s a streetwalker now. Like Menchu. A whore? Ask 'Fueguena', she knew her. Have you ever heard the orphans say she had a scar? No. I know nothing. Keep saying you know nothing and we’ll set your beaver on fire. Leave her. Fucking rag picker. What’s he looking for? And all for four issues of Merlin. There’s only three. Well, there’s no more. Now get out! Show her outside, Luis. If you talk about this, we’re going to cut your pretty face and crop your hair. And then we’ll make you dance on top of the bombshell. Whatever. Something else? Don’t you want something else from me? You think you are so smart, don’t you, pigs? I don’t believe there’s a bombshell. Look what I do with it. Juani, don’t joke with that! It was never clear. Why was Jaba looking for that woman? I’m still wondering. What could he possibly see in Aurora Nin? It doesn’t matter. You are making up everything. Sister. Let’s just say Jaba felt pity for that woman. He never felt pity! He used to pray. Someone who prays can’t be that bad. Come on, sister. Girls! Come on! You have to leave this like silver and gold before going to lunch. Can I take these candles to the Madonna, Miss Mois? But of course. Miss Mois, you have a phone call! In 1936 your father was dedicated to setting churches on fire. You used to help him. Look. - That's not me. - Yes. It's you. Torch in hand at Paseo de San Juan. You also helped him burn this chapel. I’ll have to accuse you. Unless you help me. What should I do? Tell me who plays Demon. Nobody knows yet. I’ll do it. Yes? From Robira’s jewellery. Just a second. This is for you. - Thank you, miss. - Goodbye. Come here! Now! Yes. Easy. Don’t shout. What you want? Who are you? - Don't shout. Get it! - Yes. Now you’ll do as I tell you. Sit on the bed. Sit down! Hold me. More. Harder! You smell good. Harder! I would be pleased to put the horns on your man now. It’s a shame I didn’t meet you before. I like you. Now don’t move. Stand up. But what are you going to do? It won’t hurt much. No, mercy, no! Palau. Look what Nadal brought for us. By midday is silver, by night a killer. Someone’s complaining for the paella at night. Fuck them! I can’t cook anything else. They went to see the one-eyed man, on their knees, begging him to intervene. Just imagine. What did he say? ‘To hell with the authorities.’ That he would turn down any other petition. Nice, eh? It looks marvellous! They’ll never learn. They’re the same people who came to see the churches being burned. Now they go on their knees at the processions. Here we go! I was thinking on visiting Margarita. She bought a pair of rope-soled sandals. What’s wrong? Well, they have prohibited the crossing at Plaza del Sol. That worries you? Last year, fifteen or twenty 'Blue Shirts' appeared at the plaza... and began beating everyone. Motherfuckers! They marked the four bars on a young woman’s arm with a machete. And the Falangist who did it was a fifteen year old brat. A big hurray for Palau’s paella. Yes, hurray! Hurray! The other day a lunatic was wandering at the plaza with the blue shirt open, displaying three medal rows pierced to his skin. That’s nothing. Each day they kill three or four of us in the Boot’s Camp. This must come to an end. The Allies will win the war… and then… Then, they’ll come to give you a price. Do you believe that? Franco, Hitler and Mussolini, they’re the same thing. They were so in 1936 already. And here we are. In any case, something has to be done. We have no guns. I have my piece buried in the yard, close to the lemon tree. That’s enough for me. I still have some dozens left. All that’s okay, but let’s make something clear: I know nothing about manifestos and little manoeuvres. I get to the point. Out first obligation is to empty their wallets. I’ll keep saying it. Hey, we are not bandits. Palau’s right. There are many ways to fuck them. Cleaning out their banks, their factories, their supply offices, and their wallets. A clandestine movement needs resources. We’ll have to make an effort. Don’t forget about Marcos. He will have to leave his hideout someday. We informed him. He was behind me disguised as a marine. He should be around. Wandering about undecided. Scared shitless like a gipsy digging trenches. He was well known for his guts. Always in front, always with his chest uncovered. Until he got obsessed with the Russian agents. When the disbandment occurred, he decided to stay here. He said we had to keep fighting. To the end. Russian agents everywhere. There he is. With his ass shrunk. Leave him alone. He’s all fucked up, but you’re all responsible. Those who attacked him, and you who didn’t defend him. Let’s forget about this shit. We can’t afford to be affected by this. Help! Help! Fire! Quick! Do something! Save the clothes! Don’t let it burn! Hold it! You’re going to call the neighbors’ attention! You act like children! Come on! Sit! It’s all right. It’s all right. It’s nothing. A rocket went under at the 'Migueles’. Give me one! Here! I want one! - Come on! - Rubianca, what did the boy do to you? It’s what I am going to do to him! I’ll tear his ears off! Let’s go! Tie up your shoes! Tie your shoes I tell you! Come on, let’s go! In the expected scenario by the German government for the realization of different meetings with state heads of the friendly nations, the fuhrer is on his way to the Spanish frontier, where hours later an interview with General Franco will take place. There is a friendly and relaxed atmosphere among the members of the retinue. The Third Reich aspires for a continuation of an amiable relation with Spain, favourable to the Axis’ cause. Well. What do you say? Molotov, the foreign minister for the Soviet Union, arrives in Berlin to hold and interview with his German colleague Von Ribbentrop. The object of the visit is to establish a first personal contact to go deep into the exchange of ideas between the two potencies. Von Ribbentrop greets Molotov personally at Anjarten, the Berlin station. Documentation. What happened? He’s injured! Today, the earth and the sky are smiling on me. Today, the sun reaches the bottom of my soul. Today, I have seen her. She has seen me too. Today, I believe in God. If the comrades heard you. To love is living under another sun. Terrified to touch it. Listen. If what you need is a chick, I can get you one. I have some money, so I can get anything I want. But that one… That one. Aurora… Aurora Nin. Andre’s niece. It’s a long story. You don’t remember, you were a child. She was marked. She had some scars in her body. Always… the hand of the master, son a bad bitch. He marked her with a broken bottle. A champagne bottle. It happened during a bombing. She had a piece of shrapnel in her body. Together, we dreamed of love. We made love. And now… We cry for love. Do you know who said that? Why he said it? They used to call her 'Aurora La Roja'. They would have executed her by that name. No! Her uncle would have told me! It’s nearly dawn. - The nationals killed her. - No. I would know about it. Her uncle would have been here to tell me. Her uncle was killed by the Chinese during the war. Come. Come. They’re looking for her… and me. To kill her… and me. The Chinese and the Fachas have planned to kill us. But we are alive. Do you remember it’s name? It’s Jaba’s. We'll call it 'La Ramona'. 'The Red Bitch'. Everybody is looking for her. Why? Because she carries a Russian film on the nipple, under the scar. Right, Sarnita? Juanita. Maria. Rubianca, like my mother. My sister's name is 'Paz'. Careful, a gun was fired accidentally once. My father always says it. They’re unloaded. Well, leave them. We could sell them to the 'Makis'. Try it, and they’d kill you, your father and your mother; I won’t tell you any more. We’ll take them out the day when people set the churches on fire again. C’mon, let’s swear on it. All for one and one for all! Hi. Does an old dumb woman live here? Yes, madam, but she is not here. And her grandson? Jaba, someone wants to see you! Give him a tip. Are you Daniel Jabalolles? C’mon, eat a little while we talk. But you’ll have to share with your grandmother. In 'Las Animas'... We now have food, clothing, and medicines at our disposal. We are making a list of the families in dire need. You and your grandmother, for example. Didn’t you have a brother too? He left on a ship. He always wanted to be a sailor. Come. Come here, please. Don’t be afraid. What’s happening? Is there a party? Don’t you have school today? What about you? Why are you wearing those gloves? Ah, gloves, gloves, manias of a sick person. Do you like some candies? The sweetest candies for you all. Is it true that you have wooden legs? Wooden legs… I have tobacco too, cigarettes so you can have fun. Wooden legs… And the shoes and socks are painted? I was wounded in the crusade. And I can’t walk, but my legs are real. They’re real. Does this car have a radio? Well, yes. Turn on the radio, Gonzalo. Let the kids have fun. Concha Piquer. Don’t you like Conchita Piquer? Oh, wonderful! I love her. Concha Piquer. Tell me, is Daniel Jabalolles your friend? Did you just come to ask me how many of us live in this house? - That's all? - Quid pro quo. I also came to ask you for a favour. Tell me. The congregation has been looking for a person for some time now. They have seen you with her. We want to help her, but we don’t know where she lives. A young woman… A poor misguided girl who has suffered a lot. Are you ready? Now! Java! Java! Java! Don’t say a word! Her name is Aurora Nin. I don’t know anybody with that name. Surely she’s using another name now. She might even have had her hair dyed. She must be terrified. Why? For something bad she did once, she said. But that doesn’t matter now. I have a special interest to help her. She used to be my maid. She was always a good lovable girl. Who says they saw us? An old chauffeur of ours. But that doesn’t matter, son. Maybe he was confused. And your son was acquainted with her too? My son is paralysed and she’s a streetwalker. Never mind. Also, and I tell you this in case it might help you remember, someone told me that Aurora had something to do with your brother. A long time ago. Before the war. We haven’t heard a word about my brother. As to her… No, Madame. Believe me, I don’t know her. Come on. Ten. Nothing. Eight. Come on. Just seven. Your turn. What’s with you? Do you want to live on my expenses? That’s what I always say to a brother. If you want to destroy the fascists, take their wallets. ’Carota’. No wonder they call you cynical. The minute you have five 'duros', you spend it in the 'Bolero'. Where do you think I get my information from? At the telephone company? - Any luck? - No. Help me or I'll lose myself. Give me a drink. What’s up? Waiting. You think this is a good place? - How do you know her? - The Blonde? I come here every night. She does too, and we play dice sometimes. She likes to lose. The typical carouser turned into a whore. She thinks she isn’t worth what they’d pay for her. - What's her name? - Menchu. Carmen. Carmen Soto I think. She’s the mistress of a famous black marketeer. His name is Nunez. As insignificant as she may seem, she’s connected even with the bishop. She was assaulted the other day. The robber hit her in the head. Unbelievable! There he is. Where’s the toilet? The rest room is upstairs. If Marcos shows up, this will be like a meeting of the fleet. Look behind. He seems to be very interested. Remember, we made the service together. We are gathered here to remember old times. They’re not that old. It was just a year ago that you lose the war. You lost it too. All of us. Even the Blonde… And now she has to fuck with a black marketeer. Well, let’s play now. They’re tired of personal actions in Toulouse. Where’s Marco? Hidden. Walled up. Nobody knows where. Find him then. Tell him to come. But not here, at the factory in Pueblo Nuevo. All right? If we want Marcos to leave his hideout, we need to send him a certificate… guaranteeing that the Chinese are no longer looking for him. Otherwise, he’ll be locked up. He’s not afraid, he’s panicked, terrified. To him, the Chinese and the 'Fachas' are the same thing. A burned cat. He either hides like a rat or comes out asking for a machine gun. He’s fucked up. He was a lion. You should’ve seen him in Belchite. He was never afraid. It’s something else. It’s fear, believe me. He’s cracked. And I know why, Palau. - Yes, for all the men he wasted. - No, not for all. Just one of them. One whose name was Conrado Galan. Am I wrong? Ask him. Me? If you want I’ll sing it to you. The lyrics come from Master Quintero. - It weighs a hundred kilos. - No less than two hundred. It didn’t explode because the pilot was committing sabotage. That’s why they executed him on Christmas day in Belchite. There were almond shells all over it. Listen, boys… Behind that business of the red bitch with the scar on the nipple… or the Blonde with the flashy coat, there’s something really twisted. Java wants to be friend of Master Conrado so he can leave his job as a rag picker. Yes. Because Java wants to be a movie artist. Where the hell is Lucifer? He is always late, damn it! He won’t come. What? Their house was on fire. But how? When? Yesterday. His hands got burned. - These things always happen to him. - That's because he's a little fool. A big fool! Silence! What are you doing here? Who gave you permission to enter? Miguel’s mother sent me. He can’t come. His hands are bandaged. They even have to feed him. - Is that true? - Yes, Master Conrado, it's true. I would love to be part of the cast, my lieutenant. I’m nobody’s lieutenant! And we don’t need you here! Is that clear? I would like to play Lucifer, Master Conrado. I know the role by heart. No! This army, this empire, what’s the use if you shall see yourself, oh, shame, oh, vilification, humiliated and confused to the point that a weak woman, an immaculate virgin, shall courageously leave her worn sole stamped over your proud forehead? What do you think? Terrible. Well, you’ll take his place, but only during rehearsals. Don’t expect more. Miguel is irreplaceable. Come on, let’s rehearse scene number ten. The woods and Saint Michael. - Where is Miguel? - He's changing. I'll go find him. You’ll go first. The end of scene nine. Do you know it? Let’s see if it’s true. Can I dress as Lucifer? It’ll be more dramatic. But quickly! Come on! Move! Let’s help Master Conrado. Easy! Easy! Let’s begin! The pants are too tight. But it’s acceptable. Go ahead. I am that big counsellor who was thrown out of the king’s house and was condemned to the abyss. Be advised then that I am your enemy! Lucifer. Run! Run! Don’t run shepherds! And you, horrendous being, you have the whole world on fire, and still want me to calm your thirst? Get out of here, you villain! Hold it! Don’t raise your voice the victory; there's no 'patentory' reason... - Peremptory! - Peremptory! Sorry. Don’t suffocate my anger! Arrogant, bold breath. You are opposed to Heaven. Stop your voice. Don’t boast claiming victory! Curse! Curse! - He didn't say that! - It's true. He didn't say that. You are lost, Lucifer. Here it says something about… Let’s see… Oh, yes. 'Vindictive asp I shall be'. Do it again. I want less anger in that 'Miguel', girl. Say it firmly, categorically… but also with a little sweetness. Do you understand? The Angel and the Devil. It’s the eternal fight between right and wrong. Between beauty and ugliness. Understand? Yes, Master. And you, Lucifer, do it with fury, with rage, with true fury. Don’t be afraid to harm her. Be decided! Seize her! Seize her! Try it. Try it. Yes, lieutenant. Let's go then. Start with: 'Silence, bold mortal! Beware shepherds! Be prepared Saint Michael!’ Leave that lipstick now! Silence bold mortal or I shall break your leg! You shall be the food of the wild beasts! Enough, monster of hell! I am the Holy Madonna. Vain attempt, Michael. My soul is tormented by a mortal sorrow. Though my pain is not understood, I know my misfortune is big. Your madness is talking, evil. Don’t rebel yourself against the divine power. Vindictive asp I shall be. My heart is consumed with fury. Anger. Wrath. Fury. An eternal anxiety disturbs my heart. Wait! You liked it and now you want more, eh, scoundrel? It’s not that. I got to give her a message. Do you know where she is? Where she lives? She doesn’t come here any more. What happened to you, my love? Tell me. Did Ramona give you something? No. No. That’s what I thought. Because she’s very clean, I must recognise it. How did you meet her? Here. She used to come at nightfall. She drank a cup of coffee and spoke to nobody. If she didn’t get a client, she would go to bed without taking dinner. It’s that man again. - Good morning. - Good morning. Tickets! The chicken’s going to be raffled! This chicken is going to be raffled! Numbers for the raffle. That woman. If she keeps raffling chickens, I’ll punish her. See you next month. If God allows it. Goodbye. Do you know him? Well, he’s a friend of the master. He was his driver before the war. The bastard! He comes here every month to collect the social affiliation’s money and the district’s phalanx contribution. He never forgets it. She is Ramona’s friend. What do you want with Ramona? I have a message for her and I don’t know where to find her. She used to live at my boarding house, but she left. Owing me fifteen 'duros'. Since when do you know her? Since we both were virgins. It must be a long time. The earth swallowed her. Well, they say she now aims high. That she’s involved with a black marketeer. That’s bullshit! This is the BBC, broadcasting news in Spanish from London. Hitler held an interview with General Franco at the French-Spanish border. - Are we having sandwiches today? - Today, yes. Where does he have his hole? Here in the neighbourhood? I will tell you. But, does he really think they still remember him at the Kremlin? He’s sick. He has persecution complex. We all have that complex. Here. It's for 'Luisito'. I thought he'd like it. How is he? Don’t you hear him coughing? What about him? Can he hear us? He’s coughing, but he’s asleep. I will hear you too, so what? You came to this house for a reason. Anyway, it’s not convenient. The other day in a bar, and now in Luis Lae’s home who's in prison. We have balls. You know very well nothing happens if there’s not a snitch. Do you think there’s a snitch here? I’m not one of yours. You should know it. You were one of ours until December of 1936. Remember. And after that, the favourite son of a friend. Palau’s son. Come on. That’s enough. Let’s leave ideological matters for another time. Under the circumstances, we are all necessary. Get to the point. Proposals? The first thing, get resources. What will you do with that? What will I do? Fuck! Make our clandestine publication, help the brothers who are on the run… bribe judges. Even to attempt Franco’s life. If that’s possible. I can’t see myself robbing a bank. - It's not convenient. - What then? A building. What? A building. A specific building. Do you agree with that? It’s not a personal action. It’s an organised act of war. Bullshit! Why a building? Why not a bank? That’s where they keep the money. It’s more political. And more publicity. People will talk. Do you know what happened to Aurora Nin? Forget it, Marcos. If she’s alive, she wants us to think she’s dead. You told me we would rehearse alone. It’s a new play that Sarnita invented. We want to surprise Master Conrado. Remember what the Moros did to you. That’s what we are going to rehearse. Do I have to be tied all the time? Shut up! You are the noisiest prisoner we have ever had since the war began. Lieutenant, let’s finish with her brother first. He won’t let us punish her in peace. No. We do the punishment. As to him, make him prepare us a hot tea. Just some pricks, Lieutenant! Hey! We’ll give you a lesson now! Hold it! You won’t spit again! You don’t have balls. No? Grab my fly and you’d see, fucking fascist! Touch them. They’re big, hard, and attached to the skin. The Lieutenant would die if he heard this. Silence! Come on! Continue! Faggot! Muhammad. Press hard, Muhammad. Squeeze them good. They’re like rubber. Press hard. Pull them down, like you were milking him. When I think about those things my vocation reaffirms itself. It’s terrible. They were children, and at my age. I shouldn’t have stayed there. Why did you stay, sister? You’re a poor fatherless, motherless orphan. A silly Galician that pulls out an invalid’s penis a hundred times a day so he can urinate. Is that true, Fueguena? I just hold it when he urinates. - What's your name? - I'm Maria Ernesto. Not any more. You’re Aurora now. Well, so what? She used to do your work. She was a maid of the same master. Tell us all you know. Should I answer now, or should I resist? Talk. Spit out all you know about the carouser. Come on! I was just a little girl! I was so afraid of the bombs! I swear I was terrified! I only remember her beautiful face. Her high heel green shoes. Nothing more. You know what your master has told you. And that’s what you are going to tell us. Enough of bullshit. You’re going to talk. Aurora used to leave the orphanage to work on chores by the hour. Everyday, she would go to master Conrado’s attic to do his bed. She had been doing it since she was fourteen, when he studies and his father was still alive. Before the war. He… wasn’t paralysed yet. They say he was very good to her. That they gave her presents. Do you know what used to happen, sister. Do you know…? I don’t even want to think about it. But you are imaging it already… Because you are making your aventi. Another aventi. Well, she and her boyfriend used to meet secretly in that attic. And master Conrado knew it. Marcos! Well! Do you like it? Hey, he might notice. Don’t touch the suits, eh? Just the robe. Piece of shit! If the republic doesn’t take everything from him, I will do it. - I’ll fuck him! - Come here, quickly! He knew we kissed and touched each other. But he never said it. He never said it to Mrs. Galan or the house’s principal. Why? Because he’s a good man. He was educated by the Jesuits and he would never go telling other persons sins. They should do it in their own house. In their bed. Well, yes. Don’t be fool. Keep going. Talk if you don’t want to turn into the marked woman. Lose the threats, idiots! Let me go! I’m not Aurora Nin! Let me go now, you pigs! - He never knew you made scenes? - What do you mean scenes? You are the aide of a paralysed person. He tells you his life everyday. We have visitors. - What is it? - There's someone in the closet. You’re crazy. Who could be in there? I’m telling you, there’s someone in the closet! He saw us! It’s closed. Open it! He’s in the closet! He’s watching us! Oh, my god! Forgive me, Ramona! Forgive me! I’m not Ramona. I’m Aurora Nin. Paulina. In Satan’s name… Just the tip. Faggot! That’s exactly why I have more faith. Him and all the others who died, they couldn’t have given their lives in vain. Their blood hasn’t been spilled futilely. Colonel, the enemy’s batteries are changing direction! - Are you sure? - Yes, my colonel. I saw it myself. Our people are here! They’re here! Oh, I’m falling asleep! They're a 'peseta' each. What is it? Am I doing it wrong? It’s just that I love you, Ramona. That’s what all they say. I want to be your friend. Aurora. Then forget it! You have taken a good look at me. What can you like about me? Your breasts. What did the peeper say about me? I bet he doesn’t want to see me again. Silence! You don’t talk when the anthem is on! Put your arms higher! That fucker! Did he hurt you? Shut up! Well. - Can I walk you? - No. - Come on. To your home? - Look, you’re a kid... You have a man’s body, but you are just a kid and I don’t need this. Ramona, listen. Don’t leave me now. Please, I just want to be your friend. I know you like me a little. - You like me, don't deny it. - Another day. - When? - Another day. Come on! Come on! Move! Your life depends on it! Come on! Against the wall! Don’t move! Let’s go! - Who is it? - Police! What is it? Come on! On your knees! Get out the bed! And you girl, put your hands on your head! If you move, I’ll blow your brains out! Hey, the pants! Carlos, what’s happening? Put your hands up! Come on, inside! Sit over there! - What's going on? - You. Sit over there. Stay where you are! Hotel management. This poor bastard doesn’t even have a wallet. Look. This coat costs two 'duros'. Leave it. What could we do with it? - What do you do? - I'm a plumber. But I have a temporary job at the ’Rita’, just in the afternoons. We are not going to hurt you. But you have to promise me that you’ll spit on the master’s Martinis. Take this. For a taxi. I never let a worker down. What the fuck are you doing? Come on! Let’s go! I don’t know the surname. She comes here now and then. Kid. Who are you looking for? The 'Crazy Nipple Ramona'? She comes at nine sometimes to eat some sardines… never earlier. Do you know her? We remember her because she has a marked nipple. You better wear a condom with her. She’s rotten. Nobody wants her. Give me a cognac. Give me a cognac! Somebody’s waiting for you. Come on. Give me a sandwich. Aurora. Are you allied with the one-eyed man? My name is Ramona. The sandwich. I want to go with you. Ramona. Let’s go to your home. I have no home; I live in a boarding house. With other woman. It doesn’t matter. We cant rent a room. - Do you have some money? - Yes. Anyway, they won’t let you in. You’re a kid. 1936. In the first days of the civil war. The nation recognises the gravity of the moment. In Morocco and Canary Islands workers are fighting. United the republic’s loyal forces against the fascists and military invaders, at the call of: 'The fascism will not pass'. Workers and peasants of various Spain provinces are joining forces to fight against the enemies of the Republic. Long live the revolution! There’s indignation against these heartless people that want to turn the democratic and popular Spain… into a hell of terror and death. But they will not pass! All of Spain is prepared to join combat. In Madrid and Barcelona the people are on the street, supporting the government, stimulating it with its decision and fighting spirit; so it goes to the end in the overwhelming of the military and fascists in the uprising. Your son did it. Master Conrado. With a corkscrew, you hear? Pretty refined. Yes. But is was an accident. Women must fight too alongside the men. To defend freedom and life. Alongside your children, because the fascism is threatening. Soldiers, sons of the nation, stay faithful to the Republic’s government. What should we do with her? She’s been good to me. To hell with her. She’s a woman. Women are not to blame for anything. Not even for having given birth to a son of a bad bitch. Adal. Leave us alone. Sit down. Comrades! Long live the revolution! Libertarian communism. Durruti Column. Workers are up. Son of a bad bitch! You knew it! What? He used to give you underwear. Underwear for what? By the way, besides being a fucking pervert he is a Falangist! The fascists will not pass! They will not pass! They will not pass! Here he is! Tell them it’s not me, miss. Tell them that my son was named after me. They’re wrong! It’s not him! It’s not him! He’s not Master Conrado! He’s a mother fucker! Just like the other. You have a long finger. Come on! Get in. I share the place with Flori. But she comes back at dawn. I’m still paying it. I want to work, you know? Leave this life for good. Come on, get undressed. Since when do you live here? Come. I’ll wash you. I must be crazy bringing you here. You’ll end up exposing me. How did the Continental’s owner convince you? How could you go in that place? Didn’t you recognise it? I had never been in the house of Mallorca street. I only knew the flat he had as a single. What happened to you? Didn’t you say you really wanted to do it? That’s all you have left? How many times did you jerk off before coming here? Well. Take this off. Didn’t you say you would only be looking for me to do it? I won’t charge you anything. It’ll be free. Do it before I change my mind. Come. Come! You see? That’s better. Tell your brother that I love him! That I have always loved him! That I have always been faithful to him… and I will always be. My brother is dead, you disgusting whore! Come. Come. In this one, the man in the mask saves the good people of the village. Hey, can you change me this one for that one? Yes, that one. Look, I can give you this one. It’s very good,. I’m sure you’ll like it. Besides, it’s a double issue. Everybody is looking for 'The Unknown Planet'. But it costs more. We’ll have it until tomorrow. If grandma wants it. Don’t touch. We just sell or swap. What could he be telling him? Think about it then. Come on. Don’t touch. They’re smoking the peace pipe. Who would believe it? 'Black Arrow' and 'Crazy Horse' together like very good friends. I know a legionary who, from the distance, he could know what he’s saying from the movement of the lips. I can do that too. Look, he is saying… 'Me look for you, 'Black Arrow'... Me smoke peace pipe with you… Me tell all the truth.’ But he’s not telling him the biggest aventi. Come in. Who is it, Madame? I can only tell you that his name is Ado. I have seen him at the 'Ipago'. By the way, you’ll charge triple this time. And why’s that? You just shut up and take the money. How much is she getting? I don’t know if I should tell you. Twice as much as you. She must be very special. All right. But you’ll take the initiative. Listen, comrade… I must find my way no matter what… I want to get rid of the dirt and lice of the rag picker business. He wants to come back to the blood and the barricades. The scabies of hatred. He wants to set the churches on fire again. To plunder the houses of the rich. That’s not my brother. No, sir. I never thought he could be my brother, that dirty tatter. You have to swallow your fear. At last, you’ll rest. My joints are aching. Barcelona, it’s terrible. The forecast says that there’s a humidity of ninety five percent. It must be horrible for those of you who love. Sirs, proceed to lift me very carefully. Take your place at each side of the chair. Lift me now! Easy, easy. Be careful! That’s it. That’s it. Thank you very much. Thank you. ‘Come out or I'll fuck you!’ Waiter! Just a moment. And please, I don’t want Alberto to find out! Kid. You got twice as much as me and I don’t like it. So, you better share or you won’t get out of here alive. I’m not kidding, you faggot! Look, we better not fight. Not here. You’ll see what happens if Alberto finds out. - Who's Alberto? - The jeweller. He’s Mr. Conrado’s friend, but he doesn’t know anything. He’d kill us if he finds out! I’m not sure about that, but I will kill you if you don’t share. Wait, wait, I don’t have money, but I’ll give you this ring. Do you like it? This ring isn’t worth shit! How much did they pay you? That’s enough, come on! What you ask is fair. Come see me at the jewellers tomorrow afternoon and we’ll work this out. Come here. Don’t you want to pee? I was really feeling like it. I’m working in something different now… In jewellery. But not as Domingo Palau. Killing me in a shitty workshop all day. It’s a rather luxurious store with the best clients. Well then. I want you to tell all this to Mrs. Galan. She’ll be happy! Luis! Your father’s been released! Rubianca! Rubianca! Come on, take a picture! What is it? Don’t you have a camera? I’ll shit in god- Darling, I’ll be careful. - Mrs. Maria! Mrs. Maria! - Luis is back! God bless you! If he exists! Of course he exists! That’s why they let you out. Hey, my friend! Come on! Give me a hug! You see? My hands are not stained with blood! Hey, it’s just a joke! Fuck! My son! When things change, you’ll see what we do with some guys I know! Don’t go father! Don’t go again! He’s bound to find out that Rubianca has been a whore. And that she jerked off her own son in the movie theatre. That’s a lie. A lie? The entire neighbourhood know about it! - Fuckers! Cocksuckers! Faggots! - What's with you? Are you crazy? - Motherfuckers! Motherfuckers! Fuckers! - Come on! Take it easy! That's enough! My glass is now full, so I drink it. Now it’s empty, so I ask for another one. Understand? Get her another one. How much are you paying? Twenty. Do you want to play? What did she tell you? Nothing. She is drunk. Not a word about the matter. But, are you sure it’s her? Of course. That coat is something, shouldn’t be many like that one. It is her. She must have talked by now. She’s not one of those. She’s one of those who tells a janitor the secret. For that matter… The guy acquainted with the governor, the bishop, with everybody. That's something you must think beforehand. Yes? Give me a hot chocolate. Well, what’d we do? She always comes out half-buzzed. We'd wait. We invite her to celebrate our birthday or something. And then… In its moment this was an execution. Now is a crime. Don’t count on me. What do you want? All of us to be executed? This is something more than a personal matter. Nor me or anybody else has something against this girl. We don’t need sermons now, Palau. As a precaution I won’t sleep at home. I’m used to it. Barman. Charge everything and pay the tip to my health. You got a light? Of course I want! That’s what I want more in the whole world. But, does he know about me? He’s blind. Gentleman. Where are you going at this hour? Down there is like in your head, Blonde? Menchu! Great car! Do you use it for hold-ups? You’re fucking with us! It’s my cousin’s. We’re celebrating his birthday and we went out to get some drinks. Want to join us? Join you to what? To a party. - At my cousin's house, near here. - Yes. Let’s go. Well, if you insist. I have somebody to love me now! I won’t be a lone woman any more! I have somebody to love me now! It’ll be morning very soon. This will be your night, you bandit. I’ll fuck your brains out. Hit her again! Hit her! She’s going to jump! Leave me alone! I’m drunk! Why do you bring me here? Mother! Mother! Come with me! What’s wrong, miss? Nothing’s wrong! She drank a little too much, that’s all. Come on! Let’s go home! Come on! Come on! I want to stay home! Come on! Get in the car! Easy! Easy! Calm down! Where do you take me? Why don’t you leave me with my mother? Mother, they’re treating me bad! Forgive me, mother! Forgive me, mother! Forgive me! Where should I send the intestines, doctor? To ontology. But not before Monday. Hang them in the freezer. It’s not as big as a nut or as big as a watermelon. Just enough… enough to turn a rag picker into the manager of a jewellery. That’s all he could give. It’s all over. Can the dead hear, Java? Why Ramona precisely? What hidden vice made you fall for that pile of filth? Venereal up to the eyebrows. The biggest whore of all. You should be grateful, Java. Because I always make you look good in my aventis. It wasn’t worth it to come out of jail. Now you know, bitch! How could I bring some meat for your sons? Working at the factory? How would you have done it? Tell me. I haven’t done anything wrong, Luis. I swear! These bastards fucked up again! She’s a whore that used to work here at night. Looking her coat, she must be the mistress of a black marketeer. Good morning, mister. She’s the Red Bitch. If you want, I will tell you all again. Come on. Tell us, Sarnita. In our days. Hey, don't you remember me, 'Carota'? You wouldn’t be… You wouldn’t be Luis Laje? And who else could I be? Believe me, Carota, it’s not good to live off the past. See what happened to the sailor. He disappeared. He was never seen again. He’s around like nothing happened, with a little teetotum. He goes from bar to bar making it turn on top of the tables, and then he passes the tray. Sometimes I think it’s him. Marcos Jabalolles. Come on, it’s not possible. He disappeared. How long it’s been? Too many years. Time flies. You see. So much effort. For what? We had ideals. I still have them. So long as the rich have money, I will take it from them. The libertarians take advantage of that. I don’t care. I don’t care if they spend my money on weed. Well… I have to go back to work. Come back if you have time. I’m always here in the afternoons. Carota. Luis. Palau! Tell me something, Carota. It’s nothing really. It’s been so long that you’ll laugh. But tell me, you heard that thing about Rubianca. That she used to go to the movie theatre in the back seats… Look what you are telling me now… at your age you’re still thinking that crap. What do you want to do? They used to say so many things. Come on. Go now. Taxi! See you soon, Luis. Taxi!
