You know I was just trying to be polite. By getting in my way? Who do you think you are? Kerry. Kerry Carpenter. No No, I didn't ask for your name. Ya and I didn't ask for your attitude. So, that's how it's going to be. Hey, I felt that. You stepped on me. You keep that up and I'm not going to be the only one. Great. Oh, Whoops! I Guess this room's taken. You bet your ass this room's taken. Try the end of the hall. Or Better yet, Get a tent and live outside. Is everyone here this friendly? Well you barged into Ted's room without Ted's permission. And Ted certainly doesn't appreciate that shit. Who's Ted? I am. Got it. Sorry. You certainly are. Wow. This is gonna be fun. Come in. Hey, Sorry, Didn't mean to disturb you. I'm just moving in and looking for an empty room. Kerry Carpenter? Ya, how did you know? I make it a point to know most things that go at this academy. Richard Paxton. Pleased to meet you. I'm glad someone is. Oh, you met the other guys already? Ya.. They give you a hard time? Some of them. Don't worry I'll speak to them. I'm kind of the one in charge around here. Just so you know. I thought that was Miss Price. Let's just say, I stay out of her way and she stays out of mine. Sounds like your not fond of the lady. I didn't say that. Now don't start putting words in my mouth. I wasn't implying... See that you don't. Getting on my bad side is a place you don't want to be. I swear I meant nothing by it. Your room is at the end of the hall on the right. Make yourself at home. Thanks. Don't mention it. Hey, I'm serious. Don't mention it. Jesus...It's like I've entered The Twilight Zone. What the hell...? Ok you can Control it... You can control it. Control what? I'm sorry. I didn't think anybody else was in here. Well, I'm not just anybody. Ya well that's apparent. Hi, I'm Victoria. My friends call me Vicki. Kerry. You living here too? No, I'm just waiting for Richie. Your boyfriend. Brother. Oh. That's right. I'm still a free agent. You? Do I have a girlfriend? Or a boyfriend. What, why would you think I was...? Six guys living together in one house. In this day and age you never know. Well. No I'm not no boyfriends. No girlfriends. That's nothing to be proud of. What? I didn't it mean it like that.. I'm just kidding around, Kerry. Relax. Wow, Your eyes... Are amazing. What the hell is this?! You two know each other? No. We just met. That makes it even worse. Dude this is my sister. I...I know. She told me. Oh Is that so? Well, I do not approve. Richie, don't! I kissed him. First.. Why? I...I don't know... I couldn't help it. Vicki, go wait for me outside. Don't hurt him. Don't worry we are just going to talk. Alright, don't hit me ok. Why is that! Because you're only going to be hurting yourself. And What the hell is that supposed to mean? I...I can't explain it. Congratulations, Mr. Carpenter. You are officially on my bad side. And you're at the top of the list. And What's that suppose to mean? It means stay away from my sister and watch your back. (Nocking on the Door) Who is it? I think the only guy here who doesn't want to beat the crap out of you. Boy, you move fast. She kissed me. I didn't do anything... Maybe I did. I don't know.. Maybe it isn't. Well, you sure pissed off a bunch of people. Making the moves on Richie's sister was a bad bad idea even if she is smoking hot. All right man, I try to keep my emotions in check. Sometimes it's just... hard. Especially around Vicki, huh? Funny. But yes, I do tend to lose control around attractive women. Oh, So you did kiss her? No, she kissed me... But only because I wanted her to. What? So you can make people feel what you want. Not exactly. They feel what I feel. Sometimes whether or not I want them to. Wait a second. You're saying your feelings of attraction towards Vicki was why she was suddenly became attracted to you. You better go, George, before I get upset and make you upset. You lost me. If I try to explain, you'll just think I'm crazy. I already think you're crazy. So try me. I can channel my emotions Towards others. I've been doing it since I was born. It's a gift... or a curse depending on how you look at it. So you think you're what? Telepathic? No I'm Empathic. I'm an empath. No, you're a dead man. That's what you are. Vicki's gone. Get him, guys. Alright leave me alone! Oh no. We're just getting started. What are you doing? Stay out of it, George, unless you want to be next. Come on, guys. It was an accident. I didn't mean to hit you on the stairs.. I didn't mean to walk in on you... And I didn't do anything to you. You messed around with Richie's sister. We're buds. Not cool, bro. Look It was a mistake. You bet it was. So, it's time for your workout. Get started. What do you want me to do? Everything. No pain is not an option. It's one of the rules in the house.. Every one in the house has to be physically fit now work out.. Are you serious? As a heart attack. Now let's hope you'll have one. Oh, Come on. My girlfriend can do better than that. Maybe he just needs some encouragement. I think you're right, Whit. what were you saying hitting you would only hurt me? It's difficult to explain. I bet it is. Ohhhh... What the hell is wrong with you guys? It...it felt like someone hit me. Ya me too. What is going on around here? You called Headmistress Price? Nobody called me. I wants to see how my new student was settling in. Kerry, are you ok? I'm all right Miss Price. Richard and the guys were just showing me how they stay in shape around here. Were they now? Well, You've had a really long day. I'm sure you can use some rest. Why don't you go up to your room and get some sleep? Alright, Miss Price. Now, I don't know what is going on around here and I probably don't want to know but if anything happens to that boy on my campus, you are all are going to be very, very sorry. Is that Understood? Yes! Do you think he learned his lesson? We'll see. But this can be a pretty treacherous campus. Plenty of ways a guy could hurt himself if he isn't careful. So, even with these "powers" of yours, you're still not immune to the pain. Oh no. I can feel it all right. That sucks.. Ya the pain part does. There are a lot of other sensations. Many of which are quite pleasurable. Well try and think about them then. Ya i willl! Mr. Mason, could you leave Mr. Carpenter and I alone for a moment? So you want to tell me what's really happened? I was just working out. I must have strained something. You're straining my patience. Did you start it or did they? It doesn't matter. I don't want to see you get hurt. I can tell you're a sensitive young man. That's one way of putting it. Here, Take two of these. They'll help you relax. Clear your head. Let you get some rest. That sounds like a good idea. In the mean time, I'll be checking in on you. You don't have to do that. You know you have an entire academy to run. That I do, but no nephew of mine is going to go overlooked. Thanks, Aunt Price. Miss Price. Sorry. Ok.. Think happy thoughts... Think happy thoughts... What are you doing here? Getting a tan. Hmm.. I'm sorry about what happened with Richie. He can really live up to his nickname sometimes. Oh ya and what's that? Dick. Haha.. Hey, Do you want me to put lotion on for you? Wouldn't want you to get burned out here. Uh, Ya Richard told me to stay away from you. And yet, here you are. Yeah...I don't remember leaving my room though. Perhaps you're just dreaming then. You could be right. Then there's nothing to be afraid of. What happens in a dream stays in a dream. Oh ya and what's going to happen? Whatever you want, Kerry.. After all, this is your dream. Vicki? Shhh!... Just go with it. I can make you feel so good, Kerry. But I'm George. Hell, you can call me Kerry if you want. I'm telling you, Chuck. There's something odd Going on about that creepy Kerry kid. When I stepped on his foot, I could have sworn it felt like he stepped on mine. Why'd you step on his foot? He was in my way. Oh, right. Of course. And then when Ted punched him in the gym, I felt that punch And so did you. Ya man it must have been a muscle cramp or something because that doesn't make any sense. I mean Ted didn't punch us. Ya, that's exactly what I'm saying. It's just freakin' weird. Haha, Oh Eww... Eww... Uhh... Uhh... Fuuu.. Ohh.. You see? There is something strange going on around here? And I attend to get to the bottom of it. It may be strange but it actually feels kinda good. What feels good? Just being here. Feels so relaxing. My body is tingling. Yeah, I'm feeling that too. Yaaa.. Yaaa.. Huh! I.. I.. Uh.. I got to go! Yeah, we'll discuss this more later. Very...very strange. Whoa! What are you doing? I'm not doing anything. This is your dream, remember? You're doing it all. Well, if that's the case then... Can I do you next? I thought you'd never ask. I met like the hottest guy today... His name is Kerry and I haven't been able to stop thinking about him.... I know. I don't know what's come over me. It was just like an immediate attraction... I even kissed him. God... It feels him right now... like I.. like I can feel him touching me and caressing me... Um, Emma. I...I have to call you back... Um... Something just came up. What the heck ...what happening to me? Oh...Oh God, Kerry.... Kerry.... Yes, touch me there! Mhhmmm.. Mhhmmm.. Mhhmmm.. What the hell was that? What do you want? I know what you're up to. Do you? And I'm telling Headmistress Price about you tomorrow. And What makes you think she'll listen to you? Oh, she'll listen. I'm going to make her listen! Watch your step, Whit. No, you better watch your.... Oh, God My foot! I think it's broken! I didn't touch you. What is going on? I think Whit needs to see a doctor. He broke my foot! How? Did he push you? He...he willed it happen. I saw it. What? Creepy Kerry's has powers.... Special abilities. I don't know how he's doing it, but he's doing it! What happened to you? I don't know. I think I punched the wall in my sleep. I'm pretty sure I broke my hand. All right! I want answers and I want them right now! What? What are you talking about? Don't give me that! What the hell happened out there? I...huh? I was sleeping. I have no idea what you're talking about. Richie, he's not doing anything to anyone. Give the guy a break. That's not what I've been hearing. In fact, I hear he's the one that's been doing he breaking. Could everyone just get out of my room?I'm trying to sleep. Then what were you doing wondering around the halls? I haven't left this room since I took those pills from Miss Price. I saw you! I saw you in the stairwell. When? A minute ago! I've been asleep this whole time. Do you sleepwalk? Ya and sleep talk?! I...I don't remember any of that. Well, maybe you'll remember this. This... This isn't over. Holy shit! You were truth. You can really make people feel what your feeling? I'm losing control, George. Alright! I cant take it! I got to get out of here. What are you looking for? Are you alone in here? What do you mean? I mean were you really Alone sleeping just now or were you fooling around... with Vicki? Yes? I'm alone. Are you sure? Ya...I may have been...dreaming about fooling around with Vicki but that's all. Oh, pal. That is not all. What do you mean? I mean I was just in the shower and I think I felt your dream... And it was awesome. That's impossible. I don't channel my emotions when I'm asleep... Or do I? You've got to get rid of him, Miss Price. I don't want Kerry staying with us. None of us do! Why? What happened? I had to take Whitman and Ted to the hospital last night. Whitman ankle broken. Ted's hands all messed up. And you believe Kerry Carpenter is responsible for this Yes! You saw him do it? He punched me in the face. I Spoke to Mason about an hour ago. He said you And He didn't see anybody else hit you. This Kerry kid isn't normal. Ok, he's dangerous. Well I'll will speak with him and then I'll decide who the dangerous one is around here. Good day, Mr. Paxton. Miss Price, I said, good-day! Uhh... Victoria. Hey.. Vicki. I told you my friends call me Vicki. Ya well I wasn't sure if we were friends. Oh, we're friends, all right. Especially after last night. Um, Richard not here. Oh uh I didn't come to see Richard. I came to see you. Um can we talk. Um, Ya,...okay. Um, let's go to the pool. I have to apologize about yesterday. You have to apologize? Yeah, I kissed you. Don't tell me you've forgotten already. Oh no. I haven't forgotten. Good...Now, I have to admit, I can be kind of forward when I like a guy but I'm not usually that forward. It wasn't you. Believe me. It was me. I think it was both of us. Takes two to kiss. Ya, Listen, Vicki. I had a dream last night. Oh? Was I in it? Yes. Did you happen to dream about me? No. No. That's good. But I did have a pretty hot fantasy and it certainly involved you. A fantasy Huh! And it was amazing. It felt so real. Ya I...I can explain that Ok.. You don't have to explain. I only want one thing from you. Ya, what's that? Make the fantasy a reality. Ok, wait. I...I don't think we should be doing this! Are you worried about Richie? Ya , Among other things. Well, Don't be. Richie's always going to treat me like his baby sister but I'm a grown woman.. I think I've made that clear. Ya you have. Well, I'm over eighteen now and nobody tells me what I can or can't do anymore. I'm in Charge of my own actions and desires. That's just it. I don't know if you are... I don't know if you know what you're doing. Is that a challenge? Because I'm always up for a challenge. How about you! That's not what I meant. Oh yeah? Well, is that a cell phone in your pocket or are you just happy to see me? Hello?... Ya, okay. I'll be right over. Really? Right over? That was Miss Price. Ok she asked me to office right away. Are you in trouble? I might be. Ka I got to go. Can ask you something first. Um, Do you like me? Too much so. There's no such thing. I got to go ka.. Catch you later. Not if I catch you first. I'll be waiting! Please some in, Kerry. Come in and sit down. Would you like something to drink? I could sure use a drink. Well, I won't tell if you don't. Miss Price?! I want you to calm down. I can tell you're very tense. Alright, drink up that's an order young man.. Alright tell me what's happening.. I know it's strong! Well in my line of work it's very chaotic so trust me I need it. What's up man? Nothing.. Just getting myself pumped up to beat the hell out of creepy Kerry Carpenter. So, you've heard. Heard what? About Kerry and Vicki. No, What about them! Wait so you saw them? Ya by the pool.. They weren't swimming. What the hell were they doing? Getting to know each other... a lot better. I'm gonna kill him. I swear to God, Kreepy Kerry is a dead man! Get it! I...I don't know where to start. Well, let me help get you up to speed. I know about your powers, Kerry. I know about your ability to transfer your thoughts and emotions onto others. I know you're an empath. Wait.. How did you...? I've been watching you Kerry. I've been watching your powers grow! increase over the years. That's why I brought you to this school. I brought you because I've been waiting for the right moment. Waiting to do what? We'll get to that later, But first, I want you to tell me who knows about your abilities. Who have you spoken too? Um just George. But the others guys at the house are starting to suspect... And then there's Vicki? Oh Right, Victoria Paxton. The girl you have a crush on. How did you know that? I peeked into your mind last night. I needed to see if you were ready and you are. What? You did what? You're not the only one with powers Kerry. In fact, your powers are barely developed right now compared to others. Wait there are others like me?! And you know them? Intimately...I believe your aunt's was number 1,476 if my memory serves me correctly. Ive been around so long that they all kind of run into each other. What are you saying? When I entered Lauren Price body about thirty- something years ago, she could barely comprehend what was happening to her until I took control. But truth be told, you're powers are much stronger than hers, But now that Laurens body is getting older. I need a new vessel and that's where you step in Kerry that's why I picked you Kerry! I need your body as my vessel.. Once im inside of you I will be unstoppable. Um, What... what are you? Well I've been given several names through out the years. Shapeshifter. Souleater. Succubus. Well that's my favorite. But I have walked this earth as long as evil has been around . . Oh my God. Did I say you could leave? I don't think so. Besides, with that drug in your body, you wouldn't get more than ten feet anyway. You...you drugged me. Mhhm, Yes to help with the transference. I took your body out for a little test drive last night. And it was allot of fun. The pills really helped ! Boy I showed those boys a thing or two. They wont forget it for a very long time! And Vicki? Oh no. That was all you.. You gave her quite the thrill. Unfortunately, she and the others are going to have to be disposed of. I can't have anybody knowing our little secret. Low profile is one of the keys to immortality. No! Don't hurt her. I'm not going to hurt her, You are going to kill her and the others. No.. You can't make me. You can't make me. Not from out here... But from In here. That's a diffrent story. Kerry, you've got to get out of here. Richard knows about you and Vicki. He's going to kill you. Good. I'm here to kill him too. Kerry, I'm serious. Richard freaks out when it comes to his sister. She was dating this guy last year. He almost beat him to death. To death, as in stopped breathing! You've been a good friend. George.. Thank you...for everything you've done but I can handle it from here. What the hell are you doing, man?! I don't swing that way! Don't worry. I wasn't going to kiss you. Oh, That's a relief. I'm just going to suck your soul out Kerry is still a growing boy. He needs nourishment. Thanks again, George. You've been a big help. Boy, You really stepped in it this time. Stepped in what, Mr. Chassin? Out by the pool earlier. I saw you! Richie knows everything! And what do you know? Everything. I'm sorry to hear that. It's a shame to waste such a strapping young lad. Such as your self .. Let me look at you. Say what? Undress for me. Ya, Um not going to... How...how are you doing this? Shh.. Don't speak. I like you better when you don't speak. Uhhh... Uhhh... Uhhh... Two down. Ohhh. My head. What did she do to me? Oh my God...I'm Miss Price?... Oh Vicki! ...I don't know, Whit. I was asleep. I didn't see Kerry. I didn't see anyone. I just felt the pain. It was him. I know it. He smashed your hand and broke my ankle. Admit it, Kerry. You broke my ankle last night, didn't you?! Did I now! They look dead tired. No. Just dead...Same condition you two will be in soon. But I am full now I'll have to think up with another method of disposal for you two. Don't you come near me! Alright then you can come near me. Ow! What are you doing? Better yet. I think you could use a breath of fresh air. It is a bit stuffy in here? Wait! Stop! Ted, Ted help me! WHIT Stop! Where are you going?! Help me! HELP!! You know He really never Did watch where he stepped. It's a Pity. Whitman was right.... There is something wrong with you. Me? I feel great. You're the one with the bruised hand but I'm sure that wouldn't stop a strong guy like you self from working out. You got to stay in shape, right? I'm not going to telling you again Vic. Go back to your dorm. And yet, you said it again. I will drag you out of here if I have to. Just you try. I'm waiting for Kerry. Why? So you can watch me kill him because that's what's about to happen! You're not going to touch the man I love. I won't let you. Love?! You two just met! So, Love happens fast. And Kerry feels the same way about me. There's nothing you can do about it, Dick! We'll see about that. Ka, What ever! Come on, Ted. My grandmother could do better than that. Come on, Faster! Harder! Come on, No pain is not an option, remember? How...How are you making me do this? What's the matter, Ted? You know, I can hear your heart beating from here. Come on, Faster! I thought you were Strong. Come on, do you have a strong heart! Because a workout like this could Really, really ... Kerry!...Creepy Kerry! Where are you? Hello, Mr. Paxton. I've been waiting for you. And I've been waiting for you. This ends today. Haha Oh no Richard, You're wrong,. Today is a new beginning. What between you and Victoria? That's not happening. Chuck! Ted! You know I wouldn't count on them coming to help you, Richard. Or George Or Whitman.. It's just me and you now. I don't need them. I'm gonna kick your ass. Oh ya I'm going to Swallow your soul. Stop it! Both of you! Stay out of this, Vicki. Wait your turn, dear. You know not bad but not great. Ow!! Uh! What is it Richie? OH GOD! IT HURTS! What are you doing to him? Kerry! Kerry! Look at me! Vicki! Stay away from him. Miss Price? That isn't Kerry Carpenter! Really? You think you can stop me with that? I'll take a stab at it! Ya! Uh! Ya! Ya! Uh! Ya! Haha! Thank-you. What...what did you do to me? You forgot about my powers? Transference of thoughts and emotions and feelings. You kill me...I kill you. No!...No, Can't you feel it?. No!...No, I can't die in this body! Not after all these centuries. NOOOO! Uhh! What?...What happened? Kerry! Kerry! Speak to me! Kerry! Kerry! What the hell just happened?! Kerry! Kerry! Don't die on me. Please. Please.. It got back in before it closed. I wasn't sure that would work. Are you okay?! Ya,Ya I'm fine. I thought you were dead. Is it...I mean, is she dead? Ya, I thought she was going to kill you but she stabbed herself instead. I think she went crazy or something. Or something. Richey, are you okay? Yeah...yeah, I guess so... I better go call the police. I...I think it's over. I don't know what "it" is but I'm happy to hear that. So, what's our first official date going to be like? Dull by comparison. No I think its going to be much better. I can hardly wait.
