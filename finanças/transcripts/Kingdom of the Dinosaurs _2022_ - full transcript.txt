[bottle being uncorked] [liquid pouring] [glasses clinking] Year 2030. With nations increasingly pushed apart, and the world at the brink of disaster, government investment in the war effort has resulted in one company achieving a breakthrough of Jurassic proportion. I've spoken to the board of directors. We're going to give each week's supply of food and water for the time being. We've raised them. We can't just leave them here to die. Do you hear that above? There's no alternative. [growl] I'm invested in the protection of these as much as you are. They won't be left. They can't be. They're worth billions. [growl] [inaudible] pandemic originated in was intentionally released from Russia. The global infection rate exceeds 300 million and continues to climb rapidly. Political tensions are escalating. Oh, no. What's happened? We were going to spend the weekend together. Sorry, must be important. You pack. I'll be back before you know it. Be back. Through reverse engineering, we can discover, construct, and map the genetic sequence of any prehistoric creature we desire. In essence, we have successfully reverse evolved a number of previously extinct species. In a month's time, the company will announce this breakthrough with real living, breathing examples. Jurassic, Cretaceous, they are all within reach. [phone ringing] We'll continue this conversation another time. You understand this is strictly confidential? You're not to tell anyone. [phone ringing] This is not a test. This is your emergency broadcast system. Drew Johnson and Carly Rae Johnson are to immediately travel to the destination on your phone. [jets whooshing] [scream] [growl] Come on, come on, Carly, pick up. [phone ringing] Drew. Carly, did you get the locator? Did it say S21 shelter? Yeah, well, I got the PIN on my phone but I couldn't see it. Carly, you need to leave right now. I don't know what's happening. The news said the military were mobilizing this morning. It's not safe. So get to that shelter right now. I'm leaving now. Hold it there. I need to see your ID. My wife should be along soon. Go. There's no more time. We need to lock it down. Go! No! What if there are others out there? What do you mean? It's our duty to protect them. No, we've got to fix our own. You know that. Come on, man! Drew, what is that? [heavy footsteps] We've got to go. Go, go, go! Come on! Go! Drew! [coughing] The food supply's running low. How much have we got? About four weeks. You said you'd rationed it? Yeah, I did. But Louise is pregnant. She's eating more. I can hardly deny her a sandwich when she asks, can I? And I keep noticing portions going missing. We're all as bad as each other, but if everyone stuck to the rations, but that's never the case. Let's be realistic, it was bound to run out. It's a miracle. It's lasted as long as it has. You all right? My chain came off. I can't get it back on. Sit here. You think we're going to have a kid running around here in no time? You do realize this can't be the baby's home, Mick, right? We can't bring the baby up here. This is temporary, all right? It'll be over soon. How many years that we've been saying that for? Do you know how scary it feels to know that my due date is getting closer and closer? And we're still in the same situation, Mick. Hey. I mean it. This can't be the baby's home. Hey. I love you, all right? You and little Junior. Steve Harris, do you read me? Over. Come in. Anyone copy? I thought you gave up on that plan? If we stick to the broadcast schedule, somebody sometime will respond. Look, Louise is pregnant. She's due soon. We're low on food. Your daughter's still recovering from her illness. If we don't go out and do something, people are going to stop listening and start arguing. You think I want to be here? You think it's safe outside? Do you remember what happened? We were selected for a reason. If it was safe, we would have been told. Our job is to stay put, to survive. What, and starve? We can't sit around. We grow weaker by the day. We need to go out and take action. Do you read me? Anyone copy? Over. Hey, baby. What's going on? Nothing, Dad. You know we will get out of here. It's just a matter of time. Yeah. We can see Mom again, and Grandma. We'll find them, I promise you. [coughing] I thought the cough was gone? It's fine, honestly. Go and see Tabby. Maybe she can help. I did that already, but she's run out of supplies. She told me to just keep warm and keep drinking warm water. That is helping. It is. I feel better. How are you going, pal? Yeah, I'm good. Louise, though, isn't happy at all. I mean, what's even going on out there? Sarge's still saying it isn't safe, that we need to give it more time. All I know is I don't want to be having my kid in here, not in this shithole. I hear you, pal. We all want out. It's not what I wanted for Carly either. Truth, this place is driving me mad. Louise really doesn't want to have the kid in here. I think regardless what's going on out there, we need to take steps to leave this place. As soon as possible. Yeah. OK, thanks for coming, everyone. Look, I think we're all aware of the tension in the group. We haven't had any contact with the outside world in six months, but that doesn't mean we've been abandoned. However, the food and medical supplies are running low. We've got to do something. With that in mind, myself, Mia, Drew, and Mick will be leaving the bunker tonight. Mick isn't going. Imagine if the baby comes early for some reason, then what? He wouldn't even be here with me. Not a chance, Mick. I'm going, Louise. I need to for the both of you. It's a done deal, Louise, tabby will take care of you, and anyone else who needs it. Ben's staying too. He'll keep you safe. We'll keep in contact with him. The nearest town is to the west. We should be able to find food and medical supplies there. Quickest route is through the mountains. On the way, we should pass a small complex of buildings we can search. Tabby's making a list of all the medical supplies we need. They should be our priority. Sarge, what about those monsters? What if they're still out there? We're not going empty handed. Ben's prepping the weapons. We'll also have radios in case we get separated or we need to contact the bunker. We're confident, Sarge. Last time we got caught off guard, but now we know what's out there, those dinosaurs pose no threat. They're just another animal. [coughing] Sarge, you're still not any better, are you? No, I'm fine. Let's carry on. No, you're sick. Stay here. We've got this. You stay here and take care of everyone. If that girl goes into labor, you make sure she's all right. You have my word. Deep breaths. Don't allow yourself to get worked up like this. It's going to be all right. I don't... I don't want him out there. It's not safe. It's not safe. Oh, no. No, come on, Lou. Lou, it's going to be fine. And he's been training for this kind of mission for years. If anyone's capable, it's going to be that [inaudible].. It's only a quick supply run. You know, maybe he'll bring a toy bag for a little one. The girls aren't buying it. We all know it's not safe out there. Come on, we saw the bombs, the military, the dinosaurs for Christ's sake. If it was safe, then why were we ordered to stay here, hmm? I think we need to be as transparent as possible. They feel they're being patronized. It'll be fine. We've handled much worse. Don't assume that they believe it's as safe as you're making it out to be, because I don't. We have no choice. Look, you more than anyone must realize we've got to go. There is no point alarming anyone. There's no point telling them how dangerous it is. Keep them calm. We will go, we will get supplies, and we'll make contact. Yeah, and what happens if one of you doesn't come back, hmm? I mean, that is a real possibility, and you're not being honest with them. We don't know what's out there, but I'm telling you, six months without communication, that is a massive red flag. Hey. Hey. How are you all feeling about them going out there? We have a plan, Louise. There's honestly nothing to worry about. This is what we were trained to do. My dad said they're going to be fine. Honestly, I trust him. They've got this. Oh my god. What? What is it? I just... I just felt it. Oh my god. Can I? Yeah, of course. A bit further down. I felt it. Did you feel it? Oh my god. Hey. Louise's baby just kicked. Yeah? Um, I overheard you and Tabby talking earlier. I need you to be truthful with me and tell me how serious this is. You've got nothing to worry about. I'm not going anywhere. But I am doing this for you, for us. Did I ever tell you the story about this? When I was a teenager, me and my best mate, we went swimming. We were in the water that day. It was a gorgeous day, but we weren't alone. There was something lurking. It wasn't big, but it attacked us, and we fought back, and I got this souvenir from that event. Now, if I can survive that as a teenager, this is going to be a walk in the park. Listen, I want you to take this. Whenever you're worried, clutch it tight and think of me. I'm not going to take it, because you're going to come back. I think it's best we say our farewells now. Now these doors are open, we need to be as quiet as possible. We do not want to be attracting anything. Make sure his baby doesn't come before I get back, you hear me? [inaudible] home then yeah. Don't let me down. Stay in touch, yeah? Of course. Don't let me down, OK? When have I ever? Let's watch our backs. Thank you. I'm going to wait by the main entrance just in case there's a problem with reception and they can't get through to us. Take it in turns to stand guard, yeah? Yeah. I can take over after. Say an hour? Sounds good. Come in. Anyone read me? Over. You say these things escaped from your company's lab. How many were there? I have no idea. I had a meeting before I arrived here with the director. I only got high level briefing. I had no idea it had gone this far. So what was the goal? I mean, why were they trying to play god? The company has confidential R&D divisions. They work with high net worth individuals that pump billions into things like the pursuit of immortality. This is another one of those divisions. God knows what their motives were. Those creatures, they're probably dead now anyway. And what if they're not? Well, they could have fed on the local wildlife. There's no telling how dangerous it is out there. But the boss, he seems to think a number of them were kept captive. What would they be like? How would they behave? They're predators. The largest predators alive. Come in. Anyone read me? Anyone read me? Yeah, we read you. Everything good your side? All good here, mate. The reception in the bunker's very weak, so I've had to come outside. Check in every hour on the hour, yeah? Copy that. [growl] [scream] Guys, hey. I thought you said there's nothing there for miles? This wasn't on the map that Sarge showed us. It must have been an outdated one or something. Come on. Hey. You know your father's got everything under control, right? It's OK to be nervous. I mean, hell, I am. Why don't you rest up? And he'll come get you when you're on watch. I don't think I can sleep now. Maybe I'll go grab a shower or something. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not normally like this. You don't need to be sorry. Look, if I were your age... When I was your age, I couldn't cope with any of this. You're doing fine, OK? Just hang in there. Guys something's up there. Mick, I'll cover you. It's clear. [yell] Whoa, whoa! Jesus! Stop there! Everyone just calm down. No harm. Put it down. You heard the lady. Everything's cool, all right? No harm. [water running] [growl] [clattering] [snarling] Sure you don't want one? If I have any more caffeine, I won't sleep for weeks. So, what are you hoping for? The kid. Do you and Mick have any expectations? I'd like a boy. I don't think Mick's too bothered, to be honest. It's me. I want a boy so he can be just like him. To be honest, I never say this, but I am so lucky to have someone like him in my life. He's probably the most selfless person I've ever met. So if we have a little boy, then he can be just like his daddy. What was that? Must have had a power outage. Look, I can... I'll go check it out. It's probably just a case of flicking on a switch. In all the time we've been here, when has that ever happened? [whimpering] [high-pitched feedback] Somebody help me! Please! Somebody help me! It's inside! It's inside! Help me! Help me! [snarling] What does she mean one of them got inside? She's on the [inaudible]. Bane. Must be the third floor. I'm talking to you. What is going on? I don't know, all right? Listen, stay here. Tabby, look after her. I'll go and sort this. Someone help! [thud] [snarl] [screaming] Sarah! [grunting] Help! Help! [snarl] Help! Help! Help me! Help! Help me! Help! [screaming] [gasp] Oh no. [sobbing] [gasping] No, no! Steve's dead! Steve's dead! He's gone. [snarl] Let's go. Come on, move! I'm sorry, mate. It's not every day that someone comes here. You cut us off guard, OK? We don't mean to hurt you. We just panicked when you burst through that door. Besides, mate, you almost went to shoot me. That could have be way more serious. You've got to be careful swinging that around. Taylor, stop. Look, we all just got off on the wrong foot. We didn't mean to hurt you. Let's just start over. There's no serious injuries. It's fine. What are you guys doing here? We thought we were the only people here for miles. Where did you guys come from? From a bunker not far from here. South. We were running low on supplies. What's going on outside? We haven't been able to contact anyone for about six months. Well, when the war broke out, a lot of people went into hiding. It got chaotic. Turned into World War III. A lot of the communication channels were disrupted half a year ago, and the war is still going on. When we met up with Dean, he said there was a fortified facility that we could take shelter in. Dean, is this the place you mentioned about? No, it can't be, because it's in the wrong direction. But it could be a good alternative, though. How many people you got down there with you? A dozen. A dozen and you've lasted this long? It must be self-sufficient then. How did you come across this place? Where is it? It's an emergency government bunker, a class C1. Mick and I work for the Army. Our assignment was to manage and enforce the shelter admission for those selected. And those that weren't selected were just left to die? How is that fair? The country cannot construct and maintain shelter capacity for the entire 70 million population on the off chance of a world war. It's a horrible scenario, but emergency plans have to be pragmatic. Right, so you were chosen, but why weren't we chosen? What makes you more important than me? We don't know. It wasn't our decision. Certain jobs were deemed more crucial. Then other factors like age, health, criminal records were also taken into account. That's all I know. Well, none of that matters now anyway, because now you're in charge and you're here with us, so you better be taking us with you. Is that a threat? Dean, stop. I'm sorry. He wasn't threatening you. He was trying to find us all a safe place, and, well, we're getting really desperate. You guys are running low on supplies, right? I mean, well, we can give you some in return. We're going to need more than a few weeks' supplies. We need to stock up. Well, we have a car out front if you need it, and it's working. We know a lot of places where you can get supplies. Yeah, that'd be great. What's wrong? I'm OK. You sure? Yeah. What? Louise? [gasp] What's wrong? I need to lay down. Right, I need to get you to the bed. [growl] [gasp] On the count of three. OK. All right. [growl] So we'll take you to pick up the supplies and then we'll drive directly back to the bunker. Hold up. We should make sure that two of us go. Yeah. I'll take them. I'll come with you then. It's fine. Look, I know these words well, and we should be the majority. I'll come. Wait. We need to make sure there's more room in the car for supplies. We can't all go. Pick one of you who's coming with us. I'll go. No. I need to get some bits for Louise anyway. My girlfriend is pregnant back there, and I need to make sure she gets what she needs. Come on. Let's go. [panting] [inaudible] What is it? What? It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. [whimpering] Look at me. Look. You're going to be OK. OK, we need to move. OK, we need to move quickly. We need to get in here. Go. [groaning] Shh. Get down, get down, get down. I'm going to go. I've got to distract it. No, no, no, no. You need to... Yes, yes, I'll be fine. You need to... Please. Don't leave me. Please, please. [inaudible] get me to get Ben, and I need to get Carly. You're going to be fine. Just stay really, really, really quiet. Shh. I'll be right back. [groaning] Shh. [snarl] [scream] [inaudible] Um, come on. [groaning] [scream] Oh my god. Oh. Come on. No! No, no, no, no! No, no, run! Run! [gunshots] Ben, quickly! [screaming] Help! [inaudible] Oh no, Jesus! Turn it! I've got it! Oh my god. Got it! Got it! I've got it! Get her out the room! [groaning] [inaudible] it's in there. What? It got inside. Lock the door. Get me out of here, please! Go that way. That way. Come on, come on. Follow me. Follow me. Keep us updated as you go so we know you're safe. All right, boss. You'll be going by my old lab soon. It's nearby. Be careful. Those creatures are still out there. And take your time. Be vigilant. Stay safe. How far do they have to go till they reach the supply point? About four miles. It's not far. Have you heard from the others? No, nothing. Must have gone out of range. I'm sure they'll be fine. What the hell happened here? How did they even get out? It was an accident. It was my lab. The bombs, they compromised the facility and they escaped. Do you work for bio tech? How did you know? Me too. I was briefed on the lab before this kicked off. What the hell made you work on them? It was a scientific breakthrough. They weren't supposed to escape. They were contained. Well, they weren't that well contained, were they? Dean. Dean, come in. Dean! Pull over. My signal's not working. Dean, can you hear me? Dean? Do you copy? [heavy footsteps] [roar] Just turn the engine off, all right? Turn it off. Just got to be patient. Guys, we have a problem. Guys, we have a problem. There's something blocking us. What's going on out there? How far did you get? Not far. I'm just up the road. Follow me. We can head up the mountains and assist them. Come on. [footstep] [growl] What do we do? We need to go back. Holy shit! Guys, can you hear me? We copy you. Guys, we can see you. You're in the mountains. There's a dense forest to the left. If you're quick, you can make it. We'll let you know and they're not looking. Copy that. Come on. I can't go out there. I can't. We can't stay here. Come on. [roar] Yeah, come on. I can't. Come on guys, come on [roar] Go, go, go! Anyone reading me? Come in. [screaming] [roaring] She's not getting out of the car. I can't leave her! Hey, come back! Leanne, you have to get out of the car now! Leanne, get out of the car! What's he doing? [screaming] Leanne! You have to get out of the car now! [scream] [explosion] [screaming] No! What about the guys? Boys, can you hear me? Mick! Mick! [heavy footsteps] Taylor, come in! Move! Move now! Move! [scream] No! [roar] Come on. Come on, we've got to go. Guys, there's nothing we can do. She's gone. Get back to the house. I'll meet you there. Where is he? Where's Mick? Mick, where are you? [distant footsteps] It's here. Get outside. Get down. Go! [glass smashing] He's on his way. He's already here. We need to protect her. [crying] OK, it's clear. How many of those things are in here? We have no idea. A handful, maybe? God knows how long that door was left open. What do you mean? Stephen was attacked. The door was left open. Well, does Sarah know? She's gone. I was too late. [inaudible] Listen to me. I need Mick. He needs to be... OK, OK. He needs to be here. She's about to give birth any moment. It's not due yet. I know, it's the shock. She's having contractions. Her waters are broken. She and the baby are going to need my full assistance. [screaming] Fine, I'll stay on guard, yeah? What time are the others due back? We could really do with their help. We haven't had communication since they left. The signal in the bunker is not good. I'll go and make contact, OK? Tell them it's an emergency. We can hold those things off. Come on, let's go. Please, please, please, please. Shh. They're dead! I should have gone instead. This is my fault! No! It's not your fault! You can't think like that! I made them! They're only here because of me! It's not your fault! There's nothing we can do about it now! We need to get back to the bunker. [reptilian shriek] Let's head to the valley. Go! [shrieking] We need to move. It's circling us. [roar] That sounded bigger. [thud] [roar] Stay behind me. [gunshots] No! Mick! [gun clicking] [scream] Come on, come on, come on! OK, breathe. All right, sweetheart. Please, I don't want to give birth here. I know. Please. I know you don't, but I've got you. I've got you, all right. OK, I'm going to take a look, yeah? OK. All right. OK. I want Mick. I want Mick. I know you do. I know, I know, I know, I know. OK, let's just take a look and see what the baby's doing. Right. OK. OK. All right, I'm just going to feel. [screaming] OK, OK, all right. Deep breaths, deep breaths. I've got you. [scream] I can't. How are we going to tell Louise? How are we going to tell Louise that he's gone? Don't think about that right now. He was a good man, Drew. He was a good man. Got to get back for him. It's what he wanted, wasn't it? I should've done more. You couldn't do more. None of us could. We're going to get back. We're going to take care of Louise and the baby for him. This is all you. This is you and what you made in that lab! Stop it! Stop it! No one is to blame, all right? No one! We all know the risk of coming here. Don't blame him! They're all dead because of you. We need to work together, not fight each other, OK? Drew? Drew, can you hear me? We have to get going. It's night already. Drew. Carly. You've got to come back. The raptors, they've got in the bunker. [static] [growl] Carly? [shriek] There's something in the woods with us. [clattering] [scream] [shriek] We're being hunted. [moaning] OK, OK. We've got a few more minutes, all right? Right, what I need you to do is lift your legs up for me. There's a good girl. OK. OK. All right. OK, OK. Right, OK. [inaudible] [screaming] Help! Help! [screaming] [machine gun fire] [moaning] [growling] [heavy footsteps] No! No! No! Oh, crap! Come quickly. [inaudible] Over here. [gasp] Ben! It's got you! No! No! Ben! We're never going to get through this. We cannot be thinking like that. My wife is waiting for me at the bunker, and I am going to her. You're coming with me. Now, come on! [screaming] [groaning] [snarl] [screaming] In here. [screaming] [thunder] We've got to go. Come on! [roar] [screaming] It's OK. Louise, you've got to be strong. [screaming] Go. Carly! Go, go, go! [groaning] Where's Mick? I said, where's Mick? Guys, where's Mick? No. No. No. No. No. No, no, no, no. [wailing] No, no, no. Do you read me? Over. Hello, can you hear me? We need your help. We have personnel en route to you location. Help is coming. Help's coming, guys. Help's coming. [crying] [music playing]
