The Norrtull Gang Directed by Per Lindberg If anyone told me five years ago, when I was 20 years old... with a rich father who spoiled me... ...and when I burned with my first and greatest love... ...that I should never experience an ordinary day in my life... If anyone then told me that I would end up as a clerk... but we still have to live, Putte and I. In particular Putte Putte played by Lauritz Falk. And so I was recruited into the large army of viyella blouses.... I'm played by Tora Teje. ...One of the thousand... Luckily I got to join the famous Norrtull Gang... And now I'll relate what I and my fellow miscreants got up to. Under no pretext may space be taken in the women's section. Eva is the one who came home first. She got a job with a funeral director... so as to have a boss who didn't get fresh... and in an office that closed at 4pm. Eva is played by Renee Bjorling Baby, the youngest in the gang, works at Associated Industries... ...when she isn't shopping for us at the corner store. Baby is played by Inga Tidblad Tidiness makes work easier. Emma is the oldest gang member in service. She suffers from a chronic back-ache. Her life has been poor in pleasure, but rich in aspirin. Emmy is played by Linnea Hillberg. Learn to suffer without complaining. I'm always last to reach the gang's den... ...because I have to work overtime for Putte's sake. But when I come, I sometimes get a warm reception. It was almost paradise. These lovely angels of God, beer, and a distinctive waft of meatballs. But paradise had its serpent and our hostess had her son, the notary. And he made us very annoyed. The notary played by Nils Aster Do not approach when the notary is asleep. So we sealed in the gate of Paradise with the seal of Solomon and shut out the unclean spirit! And then recited Baby Levertin's poems. And as the clock struck 10, Baby said solemnly.... Now the upper-classes dine at The Opera Cellar. End of Act 1 Act 2 Now I'll tell you a bit about working for my daily bread... and about my boss, of course. I was told I should be happy to have found such a good job. 300 kronor a month and a boss who was quite decent. One day my quite decent boss asked how I was doing thinking I always looked so serious. The boss played by Egil Eide Then I truthfully told him that I was fretting... ...about being able to afford a winter outfit for my little boy. He probably misunderstood about my little boy... ...thinking Putte must be a lapse of mine... ...not imagining that he could be my own beloved brother. But he's realise than even a lapse needs a winter outfit. So I asked him for a 100 kr advance. But he said that would be against company principles. On the other hand he would gladly give me a loan personally... ...mainly because he felt so lonely and in need of affection. But I didn't think I should make myself so grateful to such a man, regardless of his motives, so I rejected his offer. Luckily I have my rich aunt on Strandvagen... and luckily my cousin Gorel ...is getting married. Aunt played by Stina Berg, Gorel by Tollie Zellman Sometimes my aunt invites Putte and I to Sunday dinner. At Sunday dinner my aunt usually airs he thoughts... ...about girls who feel sorry for themselves. She thinks all girls should marry and be happy... ...and maybe she's right. But Putte was also right, when he said... ...that it wasn't easy to catch a guy if you didn't have a good hook. But he shouldn't have added... ...that cousin Gorel's wealth was the good hook that SHE had. After dinner, Gorel got to show me her trousseau... That had been just what she wanted to do. She asked me if I could help her sew her name on them... as she didn't have time. And that was just what I'd wanted to do. Naturally, I asked her how much she wanted to pay. Auntie probably thought I should do it for free. On the other hand she was glad that I could make a little money. So she kept quiet about it. So good fortune had brought some reward for me... ...with a bit of late-night work into the bargain. But Cupid had decided to bring me nothing but vexation. For now it was Baby's turn. But I wasn't fooled. When a girl has such muddy boots, I know she's been down Lover's Lane. It was the notary... the serpent of Paradise. It was the great love... the first one. And Baby's 18 and was born in Halmstad. And so my prayers were answered. What did we get to see? HIM... with another girl. Don't be sad, says Emmy... How about me? I've NEVER been deceived! End of Act 2 Act 3 As Christmas nears, we often have evening visitors... Girls who work on their Christmas embroidery. An older woman was also ear-bashed. She was sociable and helped me with the washing-up. She asked me if I could play a musical instrument. She wanted some sounds to appeal to those silly girls' finer feelings And so I played those busy embroiderers into silence. She thought we talk less about our flirtatious bosses... and other questionable males, and more on our starvation wages. The company's girls should organise and strike. And so they formed a strike fund on the spot. Monday comes too soon after Sunday, as Eva used to say. You can say one thing about Eva brushing her teeth. It's about the only time she stops talking. One day Emmy didn't have the energy to get out of bed. It was also the day that disaster struck. ALL STRIKE AGITATORS WILL BE DISMISSED This was the company's chief's reaction to the problem. Baby and 5 others... were fired for strike agitation. The boss would have willingly spared Baby... But when she told him to his face that she was as guilty as the rest... ...she was fired as well. End of Act 3 Act 4 That evening the piper played a different tune. Out of a job 3 weeks before Christmas... And that wasn't the worst of it. Baby's cashbook didn't balance All day she looked for 166.87kr In vain! Next day she would be leaving the cashier's desk. So the money absolutely had to be accounted for! Emmy was the only one who rejected the idea of a strike. She says that we office girls do our work... ...and pay as much as we can for medical and funeral insurance... ...so we have nothing to fear in this world or the next. Luckily I have my rich aunt on Strandvagen But Auntie also has her principles... ...and a girl with money problems must unfortunately be refused. That anyone can be short of cash, without it having been stolen... ...is incomprehensible to one who has never been without it. So I drifted around our beautiful town... ...so beloved of the white-blouse brigade. But that evening, a chance meeting... in the form of the boss, out and about. It was sheer coincidence, running into my poor boss. He's been feeling lonely and miserable... ...and in sore need of the company of someone young and happy. And he found me, a 25-year-old with suicidal thoughts, young and happy. That flattered me, and I went along with him Granted his description of a bachelor's miserable life was moving... ...but my thoughts were with Baby. And though I promised myself not to ask him for anything... Yet for Baby's sake... To Miss Baby That really was wonderful. He would not take a word of thanks. Not even a squeezed hand But when he followed me home he had to remind himself... ...that I was a girl with a past. "Lapsed" it's called, Putte! Why did I kiss him? Do I love him? Once on behalf of Baby I prayed for a favour. Who will pray for me? End of Act 4 Act 5 Emmy had paid her medical insurance, so her papers were in order. That day I quit my job. But the boss thought I was behaving in a silly way... and was really willing to do his bidding. Finally I got to introduce Putte to the boss. This is my little boy I said. There are 12 years between us. "Damn it all!" said the boss. I was so happy to clear up my "lapse" before we parted. But we did have to part. And in this state of mind, I was off to Gorel's wedding. Eva and Baby had sworn that I'd be nicely rigged out. They were borrowed. That as well. But not that one. Putte had spent all his savings on a brooch. The ugliest one I ever owned, but my favourite. Trying her wedding dress on means I'll never get married. So all was ready for the wedding banquet. The boss said that there was no way I was to leave before Christmas. It was improper for him to approach me like this, he said. But sometimes it was proper to be improper, he said. I was so torn about saying yes or no! Wasn't it beastly of me to desert him in the Christmas rush? End of Act 5 Act 6 That was probably alright. But what a horrid Christmas for Emmy in hospital... ...Baby without a job, and Eva and I in odd situations for some time. Under no pretext may space be taken in the women's section. Eva engaged! It was like a fairy-tale, she said. Yes, and so out of the blue. Fianc√© played by Gabriel Alw He was her big teenage love. The only one! The love of their lives, lapsing through separation. But I said to her that a girl doesn't forget so quickly. He said he's forgotten to say Merry Christmas. Besides which, he had a proper reason. He wanted to offer Baby my job. But first he wanted to speak to me in private. Unfortunately there was only one private room. He also had Christmas presents with him... ...including a ring for me. It wasn't terribly expensive... More of an everyday ring. Nothing worked out as expected.. Christmas wasn't so terrible after all. How nice it was of Auntie to come to us... ...since she was feeling so lonely without Gorel. Do you know what she gave me as a Christmas present? She wanted me to go with her to the Riviera. Not as a maid, but as a proper society lady. But the boss said he was going to the Riviera, too... and he wanted me with him. Help! The End Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
