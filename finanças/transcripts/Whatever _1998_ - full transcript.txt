(HEAVY BREATHING) (GRUNTING) Yeah. Hey, Brenda, baby. -How you doin'? -Honey, is that you? -Yeah, hi. -Hey. -Hey, you have that bottle? -Yeah, it's right here. -Mm, thanks. -Yeah. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (BIKE WHEELS SQUEAKING) -Hey, how you doin'? -Hey. Hey, it worked, man! -Cool. -I was waitin' out there for an hour, and I finally was just about to leave, and this guy comes, and he went in and got some for me. (APPROVING CHATTER) Hook me up. -Right. -You guys want any of this? -Right here. -Okay, excellent. Hey, where's Brenda? Dude, I just got here. Tony and those guys were here earlier, but I don't know. (LAUGHTER) -Jesus, what a pig! -Yeah. But God bless her. (LAUGHING) What's up? See ya. (LAUGHTER) -Hey. Hey, Brenda. (BRENDA MOANS) -Hey. -Hey. How come you left me? Where is, um... Can you get my underwear? There's all these leaves in my hair. Hey, come on. Let's go. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Good morning! Hey we got a beautiful spring morning on top for you out there in the tri-state area, 68 sunny degrees comin' at you today. Hey, I wanna tell you something that's really been pissing me off. What's with all this, "just say no," garbage, huh? Let me tell you something, I never "just say no" to anything. In my opinion, if something is good, more is better. And if the First Lady has too much time on her hands, why doesn't she do something about that ugly, wrinkled, sagging chin of hers? Huh? Ew! (LAUGHTER) Hey, I got a little Chrissie Hynde and The Pretenders comin' at you right now to get you movin' this mornin', and Nancy, if you're listening, this one's going out to you. (ALARM RINGING) (KNOCKING) Sam, honey? It's 7:00, are you awake? Oh, you're awake. (KNOCKING) Anna. Anna, you better not be late again. Shut up. (KNOCKING) Anna, do you hear me? (WHISPERING) Fuck off. Hey, what's up man? I got next game? I got a few quarters I could pop in. You only got one man. Bullshit. Yo, Brenda! What happened to you last night? You got a butt for me? You owe me like, a quarter, man. BRENDA: My head is killing me. Hey, Martin. Hey. -When'd you get back? -Oh, a few days ago. Yeah? Did you have a good trip? Did you find yourself? I was never really lost. Where's your, uh, friend? -You mean Anna? -Yeah. -I dunno, she's around. -You're gonna get the keg for us tonight, right? Yeah, don't worry about it. I'll tell Anna you said hello. -Yeah, you do that. -Don't forget. Later. (ENGINE REVVING) (BIKE WHEELS SQUEAKING) Yo Anna, how you doin'? You got any bones? Yeah but I gotta roll it. -You gotta roll it? Okay. -Yeah. -Hey. -Hey, honey. -How you feelin'? -Come with me. I gotta talk to you. What? God, I have such a headache. So, guess who's back? -I dunno. -Yes you do. Martin? Yup. I wonder why he came back. 'Cause he's a flake. And 'cause he wants your body. Newport box, please. I hate that you smoke those. Why? They're cool and refreshing. They're disgusting. Hey, Brenda! (LAUGHING) Hey, Brenda, how's about you suck my dick? Come on, Brenda, suck my dick. Fuckin' whip it out, man. Come on! Whip your fuckin' pencil dick out, boy. Come on, let's go, alright? Let's just go. Man, that Tony is so cute. He just has some asshole friends. He's not that cute. He's blowing you off. He's not blowing me off. Besides, how the fuck would you know? I'm just saying, that guy's a dick. You don't need that. Hey, what are you doing? Nothing. Come here. Give me your eye. Shut your eye. (GIGGLING) (ANNA SIGHING) Would you put that down. Just stop. Hey, you're getting a little old to still be... So? So, I think you should do it with Eddie. What? Yeah, think how happy he'd be. (LAUGHING) What's so funny? (SIGHING) Oh, Jesus. Come on, girl, let's go. Get your hands off me. Fuck, man. What kind of cigarettes do you smoke? KOOLs, why? Why do you think black people smoke menthol and most white people smoke regular? You best be quiet. I mean, it's kind of strange though, don't you think? I mean, I myself like menthol, but most white people I know don't. Girl, you best keep your mouth shut, or you're gonna get worse. Yeah, right. Why are you still smoking in the bathroom? I dunno. Sometimes in the morning, your system needs a little kick, if you know what I'm saying. What are you doing in here all the time? What do you plan to do after graduation? I'm, um, gonna go to art school in New York City. That's great! What about the tuition? -I have a full scholarship. -Anna, that's fantastic! Well, you make sure you study something to fall back on, like computers. Oh, I will. Now, I really hate to do this, but I'm going to have to give you an in-school suspension. Why? I can't let this go another time. You can start on Monday. Oh man, dig that crazy whiff. Goddamnit, you scared me. Somebody's been smoking again. Yeah, I know. Oh, excuse me. Somebody's grumpy today. They gave me an in-school suspension. Bummer. God. Jesus. (STRUGGLING) Hey, Old Chaminsky, what are we supposed to do with these? I'll tell you what you can do with these. How 'bout you take them and shove 'em... back in my truck. -What? -Come on, man. Man, we just took them out of your truck. I know, I know. I'm sorry, I changed my mind. Now go on, beat it you guys. You need the exercise. Fuckin' A man. (CHAMINSKY LAUGHING) Why'd you make them take them back out? I don't know. (LAUGHING) Did you hear any more about Cooper Union? Did you hear anything yet? No, they've had my portfolio for two months now. Eh, don't worry. You'll get in. But if you don't hear anything soon, I'll call my friend over there, see what's happenin'. Now, you comin' to lunch with me today? Man, I'm starving already. -Maybe. -Maybe, maybe not. Okay, alright. I'll see you later. (LAUGHING) After a while, crocodile! Act 3, Scene 2: Brutus enters the forum to plead with the citizens of Rome. He pleaded with them to use their reason in judging him for killing Caesar. Now, he tells them that he, in fact, loved Caesar more than any man present. And, he killed Caesar not because he loved Caesar less, but because he loved Rome more. Now, in making this statement, Brutus' point is this: In order for Rome to be free, Caesar must die. Have a little trouble this morning, eh Ms. Stockard? -Dick. -What? -What'd you say? -Nothing. -What did you say? -I said, I'm just so thrilled that I wasn't going to miss the rest of your brilliant lecture. I don't want any more of your crap, Ms. Stockard. Do you hear me? -Do you hear me? -Yes. (LAUGHTER) (BELLRINGS) Ms. Stockard, I want to see you. Ms. Talbot, we've already spoken about your situation. In my class, there are three components towards the final grade. Homework, tests, which for some reason you seem to do quite well on, -and the final paper. Have you started it yet? -No. You know you have to pass English to graduate? -I know. -Well, I suggest you start it, Ms. Stockard. And may I also suggest that you leave your attitude outside the door. -What the fuck are you doing? -These suck. Get the fuck out of here. You don't have to be so mean just 'cause you're ugly and fat. Get out of here! Here you go. What you working on, sweetie? -Mom, can I take the car? -Ask Henry. -It's your car. -It's the family car. We're a family, and Henry is the head of the family. -Can I take the car? -Where are you goin'? -Party. -Really? I'm going out. (FROM DOWNSTAIRS) Henry, dinner. I'm going out, and I'm taking the car. (VIDEO GAME SOUNDS) Sam, honey, could you turn that down? -That's fabulous, it makes you look so classy. -Yeah. -We just got 'em in. -Oh look, honey, you got a thread hanging off. Oh no, don't cut it. I'll just tuck it in. Anna, come here, honey. Look at you. Look at you! You look gorgeous! -Hi, Mrs. Evans. -You know, I've been telling your mother we have an opening for a sales girl. Could lead to the Management Training Program. -Really? -Mhm. Why did you put on a skirt? -Party. -Your mother and I have a couple of hot dates. Howard's fixin' me up with a friend of his, and if he's a friend of Howard's, he's gonna be rich, rich, rich. -Does he look like Howard? -Anna! -He sweats too much, and he looks like Benny Hill. -So he's a little chubby. Big deal, none of us are what we used to be. And besides, he's crazy about your mother. Now why doesn't she look that good more often? She's such a lovely girl. I wish she made more of an effort to look better. It's so important to look good. (GLASS BREAKING) Anna, what happened? I accidently dropped your wine bottle. I'm sorry, I'll clean it up. (HONKING) -I don't want you drinking tonight. -I won't, bye. -Cocktails. -Wow, you look great! -What happened? -Shut up. Hey, don't use the ashtray. Are you ready? Drink! ALL: Chug, chug, chug! (CHEERING) Alright, pager man, you got that? That's a sweet one, man. So I was telling you guys, okay, so this surfer dude, right? So sick and tired, you know, of all his surfer buddies askin' for his carmix, you know? So, after a while... (LAUGHING) (COUGHING) (LAUGHING) Yeah, lordy lordy. Right, so they're comin' up to him every day, asking for his carmix, right? And pretty soon, the guy takes an empty carmix container, right? -Starts jamming it full of all his boogers. -Oh my god. -Yeah, yeah, he's got these boogers goin', right? -That is so disgusting. Every day, the guy's pickin' his nose, puttin' his boogers in there, right? Pretty soon, after it gets about half full, he starts offering it out to all his dickhead friends. You know what I'm saying? And this guy's a... (LAUGHING) This is very familiar, okay. So he's offering it out to all his friends, right? Pretty soon, these guys are taking the carmix, they don't even realize they're rubbing Kevin Lake's boogers all over their lips! (LAUGHING) (PEOPLE LAUGHING) How do you know, I'll time you man. Drink up. -Come on, buddy. -It's good for you. I'll give you some Quaaludes. Aw, come on. He's on the porch. Act like you don't see him. Hey, Martin, how are you? -Hello, Anna. -Hi, how was your trip? -It was pretty wild. -So where exactly did you go? Everywhere. Ended up in Santa Fe. -Wow. -You guys, where have you been? Come on, the keg's around back. -How you doin'? Wanna come upstairs for a second? -Uh, no. Look, I wanna show you something. You're really gonna like it. -Oh my gosh. -Hey, baby, what's happening? -Not a lot. -Want a hit? Yeah. -Maybe I'll meet you later. -Maybe not. It's nutritious, alright? Go ahead, I'll light it for you. Right there. Get your mouth over the... You cool? Alright, watch your nose. -He's the man! -Look at him. Hold it, hold it. You need another? (COUGHING) Chug, chug, chug! (CHEERING) See, the whole point is that you create your own reality. Not just your physical reality, but you have the opportunity to create this environment, a reality based on your present thought or even emotions, you understand? But how can I control reality? Because you have your own free will. Listen, you got caught smoking by Mrs. Wilson today, right? -Yeah. -See, in your mind, you created...are you listening? -Yeah, man. -In your mind, you created this whole reality of her busting you. You have these telepathic waves going through your mind. But Chris, man, I didn't know she was going to come in. I know, but they warn you of danger and disaster before it even comes. And you have the opportunity as an individual to tune out or to accept the message. And in your case, miss, you didn't accept the message. -Oh boy. -What? John Woods and Zak Taylor and shit. I wanna take care of business and get the fuck out of here, alright? I don't want to stick around here. -Who are they? -They were in Jamesburg. -Really? -Yeah. -For what? -Armed robbery. -No, man, it was murder. -Oh shut up, it was not. (LAUGHING) Hey, Chris, how's it goin'? -Say, you're back for good, man? -Nah. We're headin' off to Florida pretty soon, isn't that right? But, we're stayin' in this place down by the beach right now. Oh hey, I brought you a little something from the city. Tasty. (LAUGHING) So, uh, what do they call you? -Brenda. -Brenda? I like that name, Brenda. It's nice to meet you, Brenda. My name is John Woods. -At your service. -Pleasure to meet you, John Woods. Oh, good. Shut up! You got somethin' to say here, puss? I'm just kidding. How's it going, Edward? Oh, psyche! (LAUGHING) -Alright. -Here's the party, woo! (MIMICKING) Brenda. Reagan got shot, right? Do you know what that would've meant for this country? If he wouldn't died? Do you like Reagan? Are you a Republican? Okay, well I'm not necessarily a Republican, but I'm not a Democrat either. But that Hinckley guy that shot him...it would've... He is... gonna turn this country around, Ronald Reagan. My father says that he's gonna be the next Roosevelt. (LAUGHING) -Nah, no. -You don't think so? -Why? -I just... don't see it happening. -Hello, Anna. -Hi. Oh, let me do that. Thanks. Well... see ya. See ya? -What are you doing? -Nothing. What? Anna trying to act so tough. -Let me go. -No. You know why? -'Cause I think you really do like this. -Come on. You look very nice tonight. Come on, I wanna show you something. Okay. Number one, number two, and here it comes, Mr. Number Three. Now Brenda, I'll have you hold this. That one on the end has your name on it. -This is of you. -Wow. It's really good. Um... It doesn't really look very much like me. Well it doesn't have to. It's about the passionate expression of one's existence. Something you need to spend time with. -Are you still doing those little still lifes you do? -Yeah. -Chaminsky says that you need to... -Those who can't do, teach. I suppose he got you to apply to Cooper Union, hm? Yeah, it's a full scholarship if you get in. Well no one can teach you how to be an artist, sweetness. Art is about experiencing life. It's about having great passion. It's about confronting your fears. What are you afraid of, Anna Stockard? Tell me what you're afraid of. I'm afraid of being ordinary. Well, it's very easy to be ordinary. Man, you like to party, don't you? Come on, man, let's get the fuck out of here. Alright, alright. -Hey, you wanna come for a ride with us? -Where you going? I dunno, we'll go on a little adventure. Yeah, let me get my friend. What, you cool? Did you blow that last one man? -I'll tell you what your problem is. -Stop hoggin' that, man. -Have you seen Anna? -Yup. -Hey. -Hey, what have you been doing? -Nothing. -Did you guys just... Nah, just a little... (MAKING FACES) -Hey, let's take a ride. -Why? Come on, man, just go with me. Please? -Okay. -Okay, let's go. (LAUGHTER) Hey, you want some? No, I don't want any. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? We used to live in the same neighborhood. -I used to play with your sister, Carey. -Oh yeah, that's right. Well, she's fat with a kid now. -How old is she? -I dunno, 17? Stupid fucking chick. Oh, one time, me and this guy, we told her and some friend of hers that these poison ivy leaves were like magic leaves, you know? And if they fuckin' rubbed it all over their face, it'll make 'em look all beautiful and shit. And they did it! They totally did it! And she blew up with this shit. We called her fuckin' Apple Head. Apple Head! (LAUGHING) Yeah, that was me. That was you? Oh shit. (LAUGHING) (ALL LAUGHING) Sorry about that! Oh, thank you. (LAUGHING) Oh. (LAUGHING) Oh my God. -I didn't know you were going to do that. -You already knew that. Hey, you wanna see something? -What? Yeah? -Yeah. -Come here. -Oh God! (LITTLE SCREAM) -What do you want to show me? -Um...well... -This tree right here. Mm. -Yeah? -I planted it. -No you didn't. Yes I did. I planted this here tree when I was five years old. -You're lying. -No I'm not. I really did. -Don't bullshit me. -I'm not. Why would I? Are most of the girls as pretty as you are? -I don't know. -I don't know either. So, why'd you go to Jamesburg? Dealing. -Stealing? -Dealing. -What'd your mother say? -My mother is dead. What was it like? It sucked. -Did you have your own cell? -No. Why are you askin' me so many questions? I dunno. I mean. you had to work, man. Found all sorts of stupid fucking jobs for you to do. Like what? -How old are you? -Um, almost 18. Hm, you know what the best job to get was? What? Grave digging. See, all the homeless people and the indigents, you know? When they die, they bury them in a pauper's graveyard. They gotta get somebody to dig the graves, so... They get prisoners to do it. Hardest job to get too, man. Had to have seniority and shit. I got to do it for a while though. (CHUCKLES) It was great man. Get outside, you know. Fresh air. Beat the hell out of cleaning toilets and doing dishes. There's a lot of babies, you know? They always seemed kind of sad to me. I mean the old ones... Who cares? They had their life, they fucked it up. The young ones, you know? It's like they never had a chance. But most of them would have probably fuckin' ended up there eventually anyway. Where'd you get that? Where did I get it? (LAUGHS) (SNIFFING) -You want some? -Okay. Sorry. (LAUGHS) Come here, give me this. Put your finger on your nose, like this. Alright? Put it up...all you gotta do. (SNIFFS) Like this. Alright? Go ahead. (ANNA SNIFFS) -Wow. -You like that, huh? (SNIFFING) Well, don't like it too much, this shit'll fuckin' kill you. Mm. What's with the mint cigarette? I like 'em. They're cool and refreshing. (ZAK LAUGHING) They're fuckin' nasty. What's that? Oh fuck, it's the cops. Woods! Go get those fuckin' guys. Hey, you guys, the cops are here. -Shit. -Oh fuck, come on. (POLICE SIREN) (SIREN) Fuck. Jesus Christ, take cover man. They're catching up. I'm booking it like a mad man, alright? I gotta floor it! Do it, man. -Where? -Further, further. -Where? Where? -Turn right. This is wild. Ooh, I'm telling, you're lesbians! Get outta here! Ow, why does my head always hurt? Shit, I gotta go! Maybe it's because you drank a gallon of that bourbon shit. I didn't drink a gallon. Hey... You know, we should check it out. You know? Do a little road trip to the city. 'Cause maybe I could come with you. You know, we could get an apartment together. Yeah, I guess. Or not? Hey, what'd you think of that guy, Zak? He's okay. You know, I think he liked you. (LAUGHING) -I don't know. -Yeah, he totally liked you. He was starting at you in the car. That doesn't mean anything. Yes it does. We should hang out with them, they're cool guys. You painted my purse? You are so weird. (HONKING) Anna? Sam? Howard's here. (MUSIC) (SINGING PROUD MARY ) (SONG ENDS) (CLAPPING) Oh boy. (CAROL LAUGHING) -That was alright. -Yeah. Yes, Mr. Herthum? My associate here needs another scotch, and while you're at it, I'll have a refill. -You kids need more Coke? BOTH: No. So, Sam. Now, tell me what your favorite subject in school is. -Lunch. (LAUGHING) -Sam! -Well it is! Mine too! (LAUGHING) -I'm gonna go powder my nose. -Oh boy. Don't put too much on. You got one good lookin' mother there. Now, what about you now, uh, Anna? Now you're in high school, right? Yeah. -So, when do you graduate? -Um, this year. And what are your plans for college? I'm not going to college. Well, your mother tells me you're doing real well in school. Oh, she did? Well you see, I'm planning on becoming a nun. Why would a pretty girl like you want to become a nun? I wanna marry Jesus Christ. (HOWARD SNORTS) Hey, hey, mister. You can't do that in here. You too, get up! You, get up! -You're supposed to be doing schoolwork. -This is for art class. (KNOCKING) Come in. Good afternoon, Mr. Tibbets. What's happening in the wonderful world of in-school suspension? Pardon me, but the services of Ms. Anna Stockard are required in the office immediately. Do you have a pass? Yes, sir, I just happen to have that very thing. (JAZZ PLAYING) Hey. I hope you know this isn't finished. What? Your boots. I don't wanna finish it. Yeah? Why not? It's just an old pair of boots. It's stupid, it has no passion. Hey, I'll give you passion. You're just missing the light. You see how it falls? Look. See that? See? Passion. -Here, you do it. -That's not what I mean. Look. See that? See that? That's passion. Now you got passion, you dig? In fact, you've got so much passion, those shoes might just get up and just kick -you in the ass, lady. -Alright already, I see. Well you better, because Cooper Union is one of the best art schools in the country. And they don't mess around with this quittin' bullshit. No, they don't tolerate that shit. -So you better finish it. -Okay, okay, I got it. Why did you leave New York? Why did I leave New York? I left New York because my wife got tired of living in one-room, cold-water, flats with a lot of cockroaches for company. -Don't you miss it? -Miss it? Nah, no, I mean, you know. I'm sure I'd miss it a lot more if my paintings had sold better. -You know what I'm saying? -Don't you like teaching? What teaching? In the last 20 years, I bet I've only taught actually a handful of kids. And you, my dear, you being the most difficult, and possible the most talented of them all. But I'll tell you what I really miss. You know what I miss? I miss ridin' around in those taxi cabs. Yeah, you know? Just flyin' along, diggin' the city. That's what I miss. The vibes. Your school called today, and apparently, you've been suspended for smoking. Apparently. I can't believe you don't know enough not to smoke in school. (SIGHING) Shut up. Don't you talk to me like that. You'll not be allowed to live in this house if you behave like that. Get out of my face. How dare you? I am on my feet all day long trying to earn enough money to keep you and your brother fed. Fed? When was the last time you cooked, huh? But why should you cook when you get Fat Howard to take you out for fancy dinners? What, you think if you wear designer dresses, he's gonna want to marry you? -Leave Howard out of this. -You won't even let him in the house. You're afraid if he sees how disgusting it is, he'll dump you. He's your chance at a college education. Oh, please. You are not sleeping with a 60-year-old fat guy so I can go to college. You have no idea what it's like to raise two kids on your own. Well maybe if you were a better wife, you wouldn't be alone. -Howard wants to marry me. -He's already married, Mom. I don't want any more calls from that school, do you hear me? You're grounded! Do you hear me? You are to stay in this house! (MUSIC BLASTING) (BIKE WHEELS SQUEAKING) (KNOCKING) -Um, hi. -Hey. What are you doing here? -I've been thinking about you. -Yeah? Yeah. You look so much older. I am. -Where did you get this shirt? -Oh...sorry. (LAUGHS) Mm, feels good. Have you ever seen a man before? -Yeah. -When? At Disney World. (LAUGHING) I was with Brenda's family. And I met this guy. He drove the, um... The monorail. And we, um... we went one night at the Polynesian Village. Um, we made out by one of the Chase lounges by the pool. Tell me what you did. He, um, he pulled it out and told me to touch it. -Did you? -Yeah. -What did it feel like? -I dunno, like yours, I guess. -Did you like it? -Yeah, I guess. He called it Willard. (LAUGHING) (WHIMPER) Am I hurting you? Um, no, I'm okay. It feels good. (MOANS) (PANTING) (MOANING) -I'll call you. -Okay. -Have you been on the phone? -No. -Where's Mom? -Out with Howard. Great. -You can't drink that. -Shut up. -I'm telling mom you drank her wine. -No, you won't. -Waiting for your boyfriend to call? -Be quiet. -Who's your boyfriend, huh? Did you kiss him? -Shut the fuck up! -Who'd wanna kiss ugly, old Anna? He's probably a Martian. -Shut up! Ew, you have penis breath. Mom, I don't feel good. I'm really sick. I don't think I can go to school. -You don't feel warm. -But I feel awful. (SIGHS) Where is the thermometer? Oh God, at least flush the toilet when you get sick. -Okay, let's put on this belt. -I can't wear this. -Why not? It'll look great. -It's way too much. Anna, listen to me. People wear this kind of stuff in the city. See? It's perfect. So, Penn Station is on 34th street. We can take the R train to 8th street. Did you bring the address of that school? So... I did it. -Did what? -You know. -Oh my god! (LAUGHING) You did it! Was it... -Yeah, it was Martin. (LAUGHING) What was it like? How did you like it? Well, it felt really good at first... -before he stuck it in. -And then what happened? Well, it hurt. It hurt a lot in fact. Yeah, it does kind of hurt. It helps if you're drunk. (LAUGHING) (CHATTING) (LAUGHING) Do you have to, like, bring your own board? (LAUGHING) Okay, we'll be right over. I can't believe we're doing this. (LAUGHING) The people who lived here before just moved to the South of France. You know, Nice? (SMUG LAUGH) It's a very trendy location with lots of "clubs nearby." This is the south view, with it's lovely arched windows. And this room will get sun all day long. So, how much is it again? $4,500 a month. $4,500 security. A $10,000 fixture fee. And of course... The realtor's fee. What is it exactly that you ladies do? This is Anna Stockard. You know... The famous painter? There it is. -Hi. -Hi. Oh. (LAUGHING) Ladies. -Hi, can I help you? -Um... We were just looking around, but um... I did apply to go here. That's wonderful. Would you like to go on a tour? Sure. This is Freshman art department. Right this way, Ladies. Alright, if you follow me, you'll see up here on the right, we have a whole row of lockers. Each student who comes to school here will receive their own locker. This is just a home away from home, a place to store your stuff when you're here at school. And this is the workstation area. Why don't you come on in? There are four students that share a workstation. It's a place where you can come and work on your art work. It is open 24 hours a day, which makes it easy for the students. This is the art storage room. This is where you can store some of your paintings when you're not working on them or you don't want to take them home with you. There are also these tables that you can lay your art work out on to take a look at. Come on, let's go this way. This is one of our anatomy classes. Why don't you come on in, and we'll take a look? -Oh! (LAUGHING) -Sh! She's totally naked! What? That guy. A million bucks. -Brenda, that's disgusting. -Two million. Guaranteed disease free. Just a blowjob. And, you don't have to swallow. -Brenda, that's terrible. -So you hold your nose. Besides, just think about what a treat it would be for him to get a blowjob from a pretty 17-year-old girl. -Hi. -Hi. (BAR MUSIC) Why am I smoking? Every time I get drunk, I smoke. I'm 25 years old, I've told my mother for 25 years, I say, "Mom, don't smoke." "It smells up the house." Here I am, I smoke, it's ridiculous. It's menthol and everything, that's disgusting. Uh, so, after undergrad, my dad thought, uh, that I should take my LSATS. And I did. And I did okay. Not great, but my dad is on the board of trustees, so...that helped. It's really difficult law school to get in to. Actually...it's really difficult being at law school. You must be really smart. -Hey. -Hey, you guy wanna blow this joint or what? So, uh... Gabriella, (LAUGHING) shall we mosey? -Yeah. -Okay, Gabriella? Is that alright with you, Stevie? -I'll, uh, get your belt. -Thanks. Oh. (AWKWARD SHUFFLING) Sorry. Go ahead, sorry. -You okay? -Yeah. After you, after you. You go first. I'll follow. Thanks a lot. (CHATTER) (COUGHING) -Hey, come here. Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine. You need some lip-gloss. -I can do it. -Okay, fine. You're so beautiful. -Oh, no. No. -Uh, what? Why? (PANTING) -What? -It's just that it's, um... -It's not really a good time. -Why? It's that time of the month. (BREATHING HEAVY) Well, um... There's some other things that we could do. (GRUNTING) (GROANING) (PUKING) Oh, fuck! What the fuck are you doing? Sorry? Jesus Christ, you threw up all over me. -I didn't mean to. -Didn't mean to my ass. What the fuck you do to her, man? Nothing, she just threw up all over me. -What the fuck is your problem? -What are you chicks, whackos? (CARS HONKING) So, I guess I didn't do it right. No, you didn't. (LAUGHING) You have to relax your throat. You know? Don't put it so far back. Don't worry about it, that guy was an asshole. You'll never see him again. -I did it too once. -You did? When? Long time ago. Oh, look a the baby! -He's beautiful. -Oh, thank you. His name's Eddie. Aw, we have a friend named Eddie. -What do you think? -Hi! Hey, beautiful. -Hi. -Hi... I thought that... -Disappointed? -No, but... The ordinary, you know. (TV LOUD) I'm watchin' that. -Is that my dress? -Yeah. I thought you were sick. -Paris... -It doesn't pay as much as any odd job. But you don't need money to have fun in Paris. -I was going to Paris. -When? In college. I was going to do an apprenticeship at one of the fashion houses. Why didn't you go? I got pregnant. Oh, a letter came for you from Cooper Union. Don't expect so much. It's a little easier that way. (BELL RINGING) (CHATTER) -Um, Mr. Stanley? -Yes? I was wondering if I could possibly get an extension on my term paper? You want an extension on a term paper that was assigned seven weeks ago, -and is due Friday? -Well... -Yeah. -Has there been any physical condition that I'm unaware of? Have you been ill? No, not really. It's just that, um... You've sat in the back of my class all year, doing nothing but giggling, at my expense, with that friend of yours. Why should I give you an extension? Do you deserve it? -No. -The paper is due at 8:30am on Friday morning. If it is not on my desk, you will fail. Period. -Hey, man, come on, I've been looking for you. -No, man, I gotta go... No, no, come on. Look what I found. Dig it, man. I think this is a cool bag for when you cut out to New York, you know? For your travels. I had it when I was in New York. It's still good. Good leather. It's got passion too, I got it in Argentina. Here, what do you think? Yeah, it's um... it's great. -I'm late, okay? I gotta go. -Oh yeah, sure sure. (KNOCKING) Come on in, I'll be right there. -Anna? -Hi. Hi, what can I do for you, dear, sweet, Anna? Oh, I dunno. It's just that... Things aren't really turning out how I planned. Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans. WOMAN: John Lennon said that. Hi. Anna, this is Roxanne, Roxanna, this is Anna. Hi, nice to meet you. -Oh, I like those jeans. -Thanks. Well, we're on our way out, do you need a ride? No, I have my bike. Oh. See you later. It was nice meeting you. -Okay. -Okay. (LAUGHING) -So... -So, I'll call you tomorrow or something? Okay, yeah. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. Sleep good. Get out of my room. I said get the fuck out here. -Sam, let's go to bed. -I don't wanna go to bed. Come on, we gotta get up for school tomorrow. Let's go. (KNOCKING) -Oh my god, what happened? -Henry. Hang on, I'll get something. Here, move your face into the light. -Oh shit, it hurts. -It's still weird? I was thinking... we should go to Florida with John and Zak. -What? -Florida. You know, a road trip. They're going down there for business, and they're leaving in a few days. -Florida? -Yeah, it'll be great. You know, then we could even stay. Get jobs, get the fuck out of here. I don't know. Look, I'm not goin' home anymore. Come on, man. Road trip, it'll be awesome. Besides... what else are you gonna do? Goddamnit, look at my face. I'm so fuckin' ugly. (CRYING) Hey, Anna, what's happenin'? I know, I know. I called Cooper Union. -I was going to tell you. -Hey, no sweat. I told you the Dean is a good friend of mine. I'm gonna call him back, and I'm sure we can at least get you on the waiting list. Don't do that! Don't you understand? -I just don't have what it takes. -Oh, please. Excuse me while I go jump off the rooftop. What are you talking about? -You do have what it takes. -I don't even know if I want to be a painter. -Oh man, just because one school... -You can't make me be what you -didn't become. -Right. Yeah...right. Go on, get out. Just get out. You wanna be a quitter? Go on, get out! Just don't bullshit yourself, lady, because it's not because you don't have enough talent. It's because you don't have enough guts to try. If this is what you love to do, then you just do it. But if you wanna quit, go on! Be my guest! There's people quittin' every day. Alright then, Danny boy. I think we have a wager. Tommy, will you begin with the honors? (CHEERING) -Yeah! -That was pretty ugly. Come on, Roy! (CHEERING) Let's see the slime from that chew in that vat. Chug, chug, chug... (CONTINUES) -20 bucks, right? -That worth it? -20 bucks. -Alright, alright, come on. Chug, chug, chug... (CONTINUING) (CHEERING) That's beautiful. That's my man. Ah, well hello there. Would you like to make 20 dollars, little girl? (LAUGHING) Where's Brenda? -Uh, excuse moi ? -Where's Brenda? I don't know. Where is Brenda? You can try down the hall if you like. (LAUGHING) Let me know how it checks out, okay? (LAUGHTER) GUY: You people are nuts. (CHEERING) Hey, Anna, you're here! I'm so glad you're coming with me. Hey, you, uh, delicious? Mm. -Come here, I want to show you something. -Wait. -We gotta hang out, 'cause we're gonna go do something. -What? Come here, come here, come here. -Just wait, just wait. -I'd like to introduce you to my new friend, Danny boy! -What are you doin' here? -I dunno. Hey, you sure nobody's here? This'll really piss 'em off tomorrow. (RUSTLING) Fuck! I fuckin' told you. Fuckin' jackpot! Hey! What the hell are you doing? You stealing my fuckin' money? Bitch! Brenda, no! Stop! What's going on? Brenda! Stop it, Henry! -Please! -Who the fuck are you? What the fuck are you doing? Brenda, stop! You fuck! Make Daddy feel good. Daddy loves you. Stop it, you'll kill him! -Oh man. -God, is he dead? No. I hate you. Um, yeah, um... You have to come right away... God, I need a drink. Did you call the ambulance? God! Yes, you've got to come quickly. My husband... He's been hurt. Yeah... Yes, he's been hurt. There's uh... There's been an accident. Yeah! Can you fucking believe it? -I'm fucking free. -Yeah, come on, calm the fuck down. (BRENDA LAUGHING) Oh, we're going to Florida, man. Aren't you fuckin' psyched? I promise. -Yeah! -Hey, hey. You guys, I can hear you from a fuckin' mile away. Can we cool it in here a little bit? Alright. -Are you counting the money, honey? -Yes. -I just wanna watch you. -Okay, you just watch me then. I'm just gonna watch. ZAK: Are you gonna count the money up? JOHN: Relax. -How much? -Sh, sh. -How much? -Hold on! You know what? BRENDA: I wanna get stoned. -Can I get stoned? -Here, yeah. Have a good time. -They look beautiful. -Alright, I'll roll you a joint, okay? -You just have to relax. -We've got drugs in this room! -Hey! ZAK: Will you please, Woods... Goddamnit! -"Please, Woods?" I didn't say a fuckin' thing. -She's with you. -Would you please keep an eye on her? -Yes! I will! Just stay out of it, alright? Come on. What are you looking for? (CHUCKLING) Here. She's getting' stoned! (LAUGHING) (COUGHING) There you go, girlfriend. -She's getting' drunk. -Stop being such an asshole. Look who's being an asshole! (TIME SLOWS) (EVIL LAUGHING) (SOUND OF LIQUID TINKLING) (LAUGHING) (SOUND OF LIQUID TINKLING) (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) (TV STATIC) (HEART BEATING) (LAUGHTER) (WATER LAPPING THE SHORE) Hey, what the fuck? I've been lookin' all over the fuckin' beach for you. -Fucking asshole! -The fuck is the matter with you? Hey! Take it easy! What the fuck, man? Relax! I didn't do anything to you! Listen to me! We just had a couple of joints that had some dust in them. You must have smoked one by mistake. Alright? Here's your shirt. I found it all the way down the beach. You took it off yourself. Look, there's a bus station not to far from here. Hey. (CLEARS THROAT) Hey. Bye. Bye. Hey, here's some money for the bus. -Nah, that's alright. -Take it. -Thanks. -Alright. -Take it easy. -Bye. Where have you been? -You were supposed to be grounded. -What's that? -Fruit. -Where'd it come from? -Howard. -Why'd he give you fruit? He has a new secretary. Oh. Thanks. Funny... When your father left, I never hated him. I kept thinking I should hate him, but I didn't. Somehow, I knew he wasn't capable of being a husband and a father. He just didn't have it in him. It's only a matter of time. (KNOCKING) Anna, you up yet? You're gonna be late. Oh shit. This is 60 minutes late. I will not accept this. Do you hear me? This is late, Ms. Stockard. You will not graduate. Do you hear me? So...you're back. Yeah. Hey, I just picked these up at the career center. I don't know much about it, but I hear this school for the visual arts is not too bad. Not too expensive either. And then there's always Parsons. So, can I still have this? Yeah, sure. I told you you could have it. What, do you think I'm an Indian giver? It's yours! So what's wrong with Parsons? -Hey, Anna, what's up? -Not much. -You uh... You got any bones? -No, sorry. Nothing? Fuck man, everybody's dry around here. Hey, you ever notice, sometimes when you first light a Marlboro, -the first few seconds it smells like weed? -No, I never noticed. Yeah, it's just for like a split second, you know? Then it goes away and smells like regular cigarette smoke. See, it's gone now. It's best when you first light it. -Well, I'll see you. -Alright, see you around.
