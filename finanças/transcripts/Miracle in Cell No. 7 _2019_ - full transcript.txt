We are here at the location where the crime took place, the murder of seven-year old Jenny Yulo, the daughter of Secretary Johnny Yulo. In a few moments we shall witness the reenactment of the crime involving the alleged suspect Joselito Gopez And right on time, the suspect has just arrived. Stay tuned for our blow-by-blow coverage of the case as it happens. Joselito! Joselito, what have you to say for yourself? You are being accused for the murder of the child.

You strangled her? Let him speak. What were you doing with her pants? Show us how it happened. The jeans-- show us how you assaulted the little girl. So we can all go home. I'm going home to Yesha? That's right. Show us how you zipped open the child's pants. Do it on your pants. Do it. Show us! Show us how you unzipped it. You raped the child. Confess. You raped her. Yesha is looking for me.

Like the houses you came from, respect this place. You can think of these bars as your prison. But you may yet find here the freedom and peace that you seek. Sir, the new inmates have arrived. Sir, you look like you're about to leave. Would you rather see them tomorrow? Bring them in. Yes, sir. Get the rest behind bars. Gopez stays here. You heard the man, go! I need to call Yesha. I'm going to use the phone. 5483, you want to use the telephone? My name is Joselito. You may call me Lito. I am going to call Yesha. You are facing kidnapping, rape, and murder. Isn't that right?

What's wrong with you? Are you trying to take a peek at me? No, I wasn't. I was reaching for the soap. What soap? You think I don't know? You were feeling me up last night. Hey, that wasn't me. You're dreaming. You fantasize too much, I saw you last night. What? How about this? You want this? You want this, huh? Don't touch me, Choi! This is what you want, right? There you have it! Have at it! Go on! - Hey! - Smell it! Smell it! HEY! Enough with the monkey business! Have some shame. I don't want any trouble. This is Boss Sol. He's the big man around here. I'm Bong. Boo! How is everybody doing? Hello. Choi. Mambo. This is your spot. The rest is occupied. I'm Celso. Just call me Tatang. My name is Joselito. You may call me Lito. I'm from Laguna. My birthday is on January 18, 1961. My mother Berta had a difficult time giving birth to me. She died when I was five years old. I never met my father. I was raised by my uncle and aunt. You talk too much! I don't want any trouble. What are you in for? They said it was kidnapping, rape, and murder, they said. Why, you're a rotten son of a bitch! You animal! Look after her. The poor thing. Alright, thank you. Want to come inside? I don't want to be here. You know… it is our responsibility to care for children. So if any of the children try to run away, leave, or get lost… I don't look for them. This is an orphanage, not a Lost and Found. Yesha, you will like it here. You will make many new friends. Come with me. Let's go inside. Here. Baby oil. Take it. We're spot cash, alright. Here's some soap. If you want, we can end him right now. Shampoo. I'd take on anyone. Boss Sol! Joselito! Joselito! Perez! Perez! Joselito got stabbed! Nobody move! Here you are, Joselito. You can keep this. Thank you. Thank you, Lito. You saved my life. What would you like for it? Bro, you can ask for whatever you want. Food, supplies, clothing? We can even get a woman in here. Bossing can get you anything, easy. So think hard about what you really want. Don't blow your chance. I want to see Yesha. Chesa? Hmm? Are chesa in season? There's a big Chesa tree at Bong's. At his house. That works. No problem at all. No problem at all. - Not Chesa. Oh… you want some chicks. You should have just said so sooner. Not chicks. Yesha. My daughter. How did those kids get in here? Take care of that. Sir Johnny, Sec. Yulo wants you in the office. Hey! Watch it! - I'll help you with it. - What? No, I'll do it. No, I'll help you. No, I can do it. Sir, sir... I really have to take a dump. I'm sorry. Fine, fine, go. He's crazy. Not so fast! You really are gay. Trash! Collecting garbage! Where are they? It's taking so long. Trash! Trash! This is wrong. I shouldn't have done this! - Papa! - Yesha! Shh! Yesha... Yesha. Papa! Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me? No, Yesha. Sorry, sorry. Sorry. They threw me in here. I got jailed. Oh jeez. We're dead. We're going to get dragged into this shit. I don't want anything to do with that. I don't want to rot here. - Guard! Guard! - Shush! Guard! - Guard! - What is it? What's your problem? WHAT?! What do you want? I'm hungry. Do you have some grub? Are you taking the piss? Earlier it was this buffoon- now, you. You know, that's your problem. Hey, you. You're not done mopping. I had to crap. What is that? A drum? Okay. There, we're even. Thank you. Yesha, my darling! Yesha! Let's not make too much noise. Your daughter's a sharp one. Is she really yours? Yes. Yesha Marie Gopez. Born December 23, 1991, 12:28 in the afternoon... at Fabella hospital. The doctor said she's pretty because her father is handsome. 5.9 pounds. Here, this is for you. Thank you, sir. Papa, isn't this a prison? Yes, it is. Only bad people go to prison, right? You're a good person, aren't you, Papa? Yes, Papa's a good guy, Yesha. I am not a criminal. They are. That's just great. Wait, wait. Hold on a second. Why are you coming back? The show's over. The concert's over? That's a concert, it shouldn’t be over so soon. Two of the kids fainted, might be the heat. Shit, get out of the way. Excuse me. What is it? What's the matter? The uh…the-- What's wrong? The kids…the kids are leaving. They're leaving? Oh no, they're leaving. I want to stay here! We can't do that, Yesha. I don't want to leave. Hey, little girl. You can't stay here. Don't scare her. Go on, hurry up or you'll get left behind. Please let me stay here. Can we hide her? No way! Yesha has to go to school. Do you want her to grow up a fool? A nitwit like… like… Like him! Like him! The lot of them! Little girl, little girl… if you stay here, your Papa will get in trouble. Papa! No, Yesha. Bossing will take care of it. You will visit again. Won't she, Bossing? You think this is a mall? Bossing… do you promise? Cross my heart. Go on, get going. Hurry up! Let's go! Let's go! Hold on! - Papa. - Yesha! Yesha. Why are you kissing me so much? So you'll have spare kisses while I’m away! Yesha! That's enough. We should go. Buh-bye! Wait, wait. - Wait, take this with you. - Thank you, sir. Goodbye, Papa. Goodbye, Yesha! Bye, Yesha! Jesus! Jesus! Here we go. Wait! Wait for us! Geez, wait for us! Wait. What are we going to do about this? Hold your horses. I'm thinking. Trouble is it's easier to smuggle something in than out. You are not helping. Yesha… Papa… I'm hungry. Son of a… Hold on a second, just hold on. What a hassle. Okay, here. Thank you. Papa, let's share it. It's fine. Papa's full, Yesha. Go on, eat up. Have a little picnic, no problem. Thank you. Damn, you let out a big one. You've got to poop, Yesha? You need to use the toilet. She needs to poop. She says she has to poop. Don't you worry. Pretty soon there will be visitors coming in again. Performers, Born Again devotees with their prayer meetings. We will look out for it. That's our chance to get Yesha out. That's great, Choi. You really are a genius. Probably why you're such a good swindler. You've got a mouth on you, old man. You're the one who hit it big with your fake insurance. I found this in the trash. Schedule. Like I said! When's the next one? When does it say? You read it. Celso. Figure it out. Clean that up. I want it done properly. Hurry, hurry up. Go to sleep! It's lights out. Goodnight, my love. Papa, is it my fault you're in here. Go to sleep. No, Yesha has no part in this. I just wanted that Sailor Moon bag so badly. No. When I get out, I'll buy you that bag. Wow. Goodnight, everyone. Goodnight, Papa. Goodnight, Yesha. What is this? What happened? What happened, why does she have clothes on? Who did this? She was just wearing undies, mister! Come on, Yesha… erase this drawing! I transformed her to Sailor Moon! What is that? Sailor Moon! Yesha's favorite! Watch me! For Love and Justice, a sailor-suited pretty soldier, Sailor Moon! Hey! What's that noise?! I thought I heard a female's voice. Did you bring in a woman in here? No way, Chief. I'm watching you. Don't pull a fast one on me. Sorry, Chief. We were just… I've been trying to get him to stop. A sailor…Sailor Moon! You always pull this gay shit! Dammit! I don't want to hear about you being all up in one another. Chief, chief. He was teaching me how to-- so when I get out, I can teach my kid. What was that? How does it go? Cut it out! If I catch you doing something weird. - Show me again? - There. Just like that. Sir, have you chosen the pictures we'll post on the bulletin board? How about we put her in a basket and throw her over the fence? Don't pick on the kid. She's a troublemaker! I'm sorry, sir. I don't mean to be a bother. I just want to be with my father. Don't you like having me around? Don't worry about it. Thank you, mister. That's right. We won't get caught if we just calm down. Do nothing. Just relax. Thanks, mister. Shh. Someone's coming. Sir. Routine inspection. Why start here? Do the others, too. This is unfair. Why are you singling us out? Sir. Sir. Because you are the only ones hiding something. Boneheads. What kind of inspections were you carrying out? Sir, I had my suspicions. Then you're an even bigger moron. You had your suspicions but you didn't investigate. Sir, I wasn't assigned to their building. You are assigned to every inmate in this prison. I will have you both sacked! I want every cell searched thoroughly! Get to it! Yesha... Yesha... - Get in there! You have no right to be a father. You have no right to be a father. You murdered and raped an innocent child. I didn't do it. I didn't do anything wrong. I killed no one. I didn't do anything wrong. I killed no one. - Damn you! You're not human. You are going to rot in here. Out of your cells! Everyone out if you don't want to get thrown in solitary! We should confess. Whatever happens, nobody talks. But why? We are going to hang for it. We've already stuck our necks out. Let's confess. If we do, we'll get off easy. He's right, boss. Who got caught with drugs? It was a kid. What? Somebody sneaked their kid in here. Damn it. Quickly! Search every corner! Faster! Twinkle... twinkle... little star How I wonder what you are... Take good care of my Yesha. She's afraid of thunder and lightning. Why is that one still awake? Tell her to get over it. She might wake up the others. Understood, sister. Leave it to me. Yesha... Please stop crying, dear. You should sleep. I wish I could spend every second with you I hope you feel the warmth of my love Don't cry, Yesha. Fire! Open it quick! Don't come any closer! I will finish this place! I will finish this place! I will burn this place down! Boss Johnny, there's a fire! What? Where? Ring the fire alarm! Get them out. Pancho. Pancho, let's talk. Put that down. Warden, don’t you come near me. You will die here, too. Pancho, what's the problem? Tell me. I'll see what I can do. I had to start a fire to get your attention? I'm listening, Pancho. I am asking you, for the sake of everyone, to stop this. Listen to him, Pancho. You let Joselito's kid visit him And I'm not even allowed visitors! Nobody's holding your visitation privileges, Pancho. You're allowed visitors. That's not true, my father won't let me just rot in here. Let's call him right now. Let's call him. Go on, Pancho. Wait, Joselito's not with us. Chief, where's Joselito? Joselito's not with us! What's happening?! Fire! Fire! We are all going down! Pancho! Let me out! Hey! Let me go! Pancho! Come on, Pancho. Over here. Over here, Pancho. Quickly! Get out! Quickly! Johnny! It's sir Johnny! He needs help! Somebody help! Sir Johnny! Sir Johnny! You lost consciousness. You inhaled a lot of smoke. Good thing somebody got to you on time. If he hadn't, you might not have made it. Who? Him. According to the medic, the man carried you but you got trapped. He kept yelling out for help so someone came to the rescue. That's how you got out. The medic told me he's your guy for the Secretary Yulo case. What of it? He was groggy, kept going on about things. Saying he didn't kill anybody. Class, for tomorrow, please read Chapter 8. Okay? Yes, teacher. Okay, see you tomorrow. Yesha… How are you? I noticed you weren't too keen in class today. And you haven't been eating. Things are not fine, miss. Why? What's the matter? I want to see my Papa. I also need to see your father and speak with him. Let's go see him! Here's your ID. Thank you, mister. This is where my Papa lives! Come in. There are your visitors. Papa! Yesha! Yesha! Yesha… Why are you-- Why are you so thin? You're not eating? Are you? You're pale, Yesha. You're pale, Yesha. - Papa. This is my teacher. How do you do, ma'am? I'm teacher Marilou, sir. Hello. Papa, what happened to you? It's nothing. I'll kiss it so the pain goes away! Yesha…promise me you will study hard so you can be a doctor someday. You should eat a lot so you don't feel weak and you can think more clearly. Yes, Papa. Promise you'll do the same? - I will eat a lot as well. - Visiting hours are over. Yesha, we need to go home now. Come with me. Five minutes. No. The others have gone back in. Hurry up! Come along, come along. Five minutes? Yesha. Let's go. Come along. Five minutes. - Papa. - Yesha. Let's go. Eat well. - That's enough. - Eat a lot. Papa. Goodbye! Will you visit again? I'll be back. Celso, go check on Lito. Lito… boss Sol wants to talk to you. I wonder what my Yesha is doing? Don't worry. Somebody is looking after her. Boss Sol called for you. Forgive me for troubling you with this, deputy. Yesha has no other relatives. I didn't know who else to call. I am glad you called me. You see, we ran into a problem. We are moving to a new place. If Yesha does not get adopted or find foster parents, she will have to move with us to the province. Yesha? Yesha. You need to gain your strength back. So you can go visit your father. Mister Johnny, I want to steal. Why would you want to steal? That's bad. I want to get thrown in jail. So I can be with my Papa. Please let me come with you. I beg you. Aren't we going to pray? Thank you, God, for our delicious food today and for-- the kind people who are caring for me. Amen. Go on, eat up. Have as much as you want, okay? Egg is good for you. For growing kids like you. - Let's eat. - Yesha... When you're ready, we wouldn't mind if you would call us Mama, Papa... Mom, Dad, whatever you like. I was right in my prayers. Eat some more. What about you? You should eat, too. That's okay. Don't mind us. You need to eat. You, too. Oh, my. - Thank you. - Is it good? Yes, very good. Sir, this is wrong. You've done worse things but you're still in here because I cover for you. This is on a different level, sir. My previous mess-ups were of my own stupidity. This time we're messing up on purpose I will take responsibility. Sir, this won't end well for us. What if we end up losing our retirement benefits? Then I guess we're doomed to farm sweet potatoes. I'm not too fond of sweet potatoes, sir. Just get on board with the plan. And start getting used to eating sweet potatoes. Here you go, two sticks. One sachet from me. Let's share with that. Sachet of what? Shampoo. Bong, here's my share. Be clear about it next time. Mine's going to be… this soap! Here's my share. Mine, too? You want it split with all of us? Let it go. This sly old man, wants a share with everything! That's what I'm talking about. That's it. Surprise! Got you! Fooling around this early. Joselito. You have a present. It's not my birthday yet. My birthday is on January 18, 1961. Mama Berta had a difficult time giving birth to me. - We know! - We know. Wonder what this is? I hope it's an air-conditioner. There are no druglords in here. Maybe an electric fan. Joselito, it's your mother Berta. I wish it were Yesha. - Papa! - Yesha! Yesha… I missed all of you! Wait here. And don't touch anything. Boss Sol, please read to me. Ask Grandpa Celso instead. I'd like you to do it, please. I saw three ducklings One plump, one lean little ducklings. But only one of them had wings on the back. It was the leader going Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! You're making fun of me. My eyes are bad. He doesn't know how to read. Come over here. I've never seen Boss Sol read anything. Let me put on my reading glasses. Let me put on my reading glasses. - What are you trying to say? He can't read! The story about the friends. David and Goliath. Saul made him the captain of all his-- What is this? A daycare center? Why do you hate the kid so much? She's not doing anything to you! I just find it unfair, boss. Lito can bring his child in here. My wife's pregnant and I won't even get to hear my kid crying. Making another kid cry instead, then? Pull yourself together. Boss… maybe you could arrange something. I could. Yeah, boss? How? Commit a crime that lands you a death penalty. Get a death sentence! Since you're so jealous of Lito. Boss, all I'm saying is I want to meet my child and I want him to meet me. Is that such a bad thing? Is that too much to ask? I don't think so. Do not touch that. Your family? Bean pastry for you. You don't have to give me anything. I did not let Yesha in for your sake. I still want to thank you. Lito. You're a father, too. You have a daughter. How could you do it? Do what? To kill and rape a child. I did not do that. I just went to follow her. She said there would be a Sailor Moon bag. Goodbye. Alright. Do you remember that case involving Joselito Gopez? It's hard to forget. Why is that? The order that came from above... is to close the case in a week. Who are you referring to? You really need to ask that question? The victim was Secretary Yulo's daughter. Give me a copy of Joselito Gopez's casefile. I cannot do that. That'll get me in trouble. Make a copy of this for me. You know that's not going to happen. Classified information. If you don't make me a copy, I will keep this one. Yesha, come play with us! Yesha, come play with us! - No running on the stairs! I'm okay. I'll pass. Yesha… Why don't you want to join them? I don't like running. Let's play together, the two of us. Really? Lucky I have games right here. Check them out. Is this a real cellphone? Or is it a toy? That's real. It just has games in it, too. So I can play on it? Yes. I'll show you. There you go. Go ahead. Play for a bit while waiting for your guardian. Thank you, teacher. I will leave you for a while. Mister Johnny!

In my dreams? Chrissakes. Here, use this. - Hey! - A cellphone! Does this thing work? Where did you get this? It's my teacher's. I forgot to give it back. Wait, wait, wait. It's ringing. It's ringing. It's stronger here. It got weak. It's getting weaker. - Try here. - Go near the window. The signal is strong at the window. Hello? Hello? Honey? Honey? - You keep saying hello.

I have a boy. I have three wives that's why I ended up here. What? How about that. No matter, I'll make it up to him when I get out. Me too, when I get out I will make up for lost time. Same here. You know, Joselito… you're a good father. Hey, Gopez. Your hearing schedule's set for next week. Are you ready? I'm game. Hey, this is serious. Lito, we need to talk. Think very carefully. Something is not right. Something is missing. How was she positioned on the pavement? She was lying on her back like she was sleeping. When he got here, the child was already on the floor. And nobody could have gotten near her. How did she slip? Watch it! When a person falls, the arms will break the fall automatically. But why did the kid fall back head first? Something to do with the weight of her bag? Ouch! Right! You hit the back of the head. When did the incident happen? It was February 27 because I got my pay that day. Boss, boss. The twenty-seventh. February. My niece's wedding. I had a visit at the time, remember? They told me the bride slipped because it was raining. The pavement was slippery because it was raining. But wait, wait. How did she get a bump on her forehead? Where did the rock come from? Here, let's try this. We might-- Not that! Not that! What are you going to do? Bossing! Bossing! Wait a minute! There. Right. The girl slipped because it was raining and something hit her on the head. They will ask you for certain - Why did you undress the child? I didn't. I just opened up the button of her pants so she can breathe more freely. They said you were strangling her. That's not what it was. I was doing this on the chest. Like this. Compression? Yes. They said you kissed her. No. Mouth to mouth. Mouth to mouth? You know about that? Where did you learn to do CPR? 28, 29, 30. Two ventilations. Pinch, blow, release. We have to repeat that until we reach the five cycles. That's right. I believe you. Everything you said sounds exactly like CPR. The investigators couldn't have missed that. Boss, they did. That's why the secretary intervened. That's how it is. Lito was rail-roaded. They used him as scapegoat. This is wrong. Thank you for granting me audience, sir. What do you need from me? It's about the case of Joselito Gopez. That case is closed. With all due respect, sir. I discovered an error was made in the investigation of that case. As I understand, your job is to make sure that the sentences of your prisoners are duly carried out, acting as their lawyer is not part of that job. But sir… Have you lost a child? Sir, yes, sir. Then you know! You should be the first person to understand what I am going through. I understand the anger. I feel the hurt. No words will come close to explaining the relentlessness of this pain. And I know nothing can ever take it away. But what if our punishments have fallen on the innocent? Go, pass the ball. Travel. Go ahead. Wow, you sure are enjoying yourselves. Wow, you sure are enjoying yourselves. - Dribble! Dribble! Hey! You're soaked! Let up a bit. Wipe your sweat off. Your shirt is soaked, honey. Let’s take a picture first. Another picture? Fine, fine. Let her. You know I love taking your pictures, don't you? It makes your mother so happy because we are so handsome. Okay, picture. Crack a smile. Smile even though you're smelly. Give me a smile, honey. 1…2…3. There we go. Aw, it's so beautiful. You, too, hon. You're all sweaty. Close the gate, son. Let's grab something to eat. What did I tell you about letting your sweat dry on your back. I'm telling you, you might get sick. You're drenched in sweat! This is the only time I get to exercise at home. You smell good! See, what did I tell you? Junjun! Junjun! We will say nothing but the truth. We have known the truth for a long time. We just never had the chance to tell it. You kidnapped the victim to get back to her father who beat you up at the mall. Am I right? I followed the little girl because of the Sailor Moon bag. That's not what we wrote. Papa, please focus on what they prepared for you. Jenny said, she will show me where I can buy a Sailor Moon bag, that is why I followed her. You undressed the victim so you could molest her. No, I removed her button so she could breathe! Did you really hit her on the head? No. She slipped. Hey! How could you tell? Did you see her actually slip? No. I saw her lying on the pavement. Yes. Think about your answers. What will you say if you can't remember some details? "I can't remember." Flush it when you're done. I did the CPR. - I did the CPR. - Lito, get some rest. Your Honor, I have an intellectual disability. The investigator beat me up. He gave me a document to sign my name and thumb mark. They promised they will give Yesha a Sailor Moon bag so I agreed. But I do not know what is in the paper that I signed. Lito, Lito. There's a lawyer who wants to talk to you. Do you understand your case? What case? The rape and murder of the kid. Do you know who her father is? He's a bad man. He punches people. Joselito, do you understand what I'm saying? That girl you killed was Secretary Yulo's daughter. Me? Yes. You. You? It's so hard to talk to you. This case is hopeless. I'll be sticking my neck out. No way. You're on your own. I'm going now. Finished talking with Lito? Yes. That was fast. I can’t help him. This might help. Have you read his files? Well, of course. Then you should know Gopez couldn't have come up with those statements? Lito, remember not to be pressured. Try to relax. Think hard about what they are asking before you give an answer, okay? I want to go home. You will be home soon. Case No. 01 People of the Philippines versus Joselito Gopez Criminal Case Number 89098 She said she was going to show me where I can buy a Sailor Moon bag Jenny said she was going to show me where I can buy a Sailor Moon bag Call the cases. Listen, you. I know who your daughter is. Yesha Gopez. Joselito Gopez. On February 27, 1997. You followed a seven-year old girl, Jennifer Yulo. I will make sure that everything that happened to my daughter will happen to yours. Not my Yesha. You molested her and then you crushed her skull using a rock which was the main cause of her death. Is that correct? Joselito, do you understand what I'm saying? - Why don't you answer so the court could hear. - That girl you killed was Secretary Yulo's daughter. Papa, please focus on what they wrote for you. - Is that true... - I will make sure everything - that you raped Jennifer Yulo? - that happened to my daughter, will happen to yours. And then you used a rock to crush her skull, which caused her death... - ...only to take vengeance to his father. - I promise you... - ...only to take vengeance to his father. - I will kill your daughter! Yes, sir. Papa! Papa! Yes, I am the one who did all those things. Lito, why are you saying that? It's over. Tell the truth! Lito! Your Honor, Joselito Gopez has an intellectual disability This is all wrong. This is not right at all. I killed her. - Lito, you are innocent! - Wherefore, premises considered, - the court finds the accused, Joselito Gopez, - Please forgive me. guilty beyond reasonable doubt for kidnapping, rape, and murder Accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of death. So ordered. We are here today for the new trial of the case of Joselito Gopez Because of various evidence that the previous trial has blatantly ignored. First of all, the official statement of Joselito Gopez was not read in court He repeatedly denied every crime he had been accused of But the investigator still wrote false statements And made Joselito sign the document According to the investigation, Jenny allegedly died as a result of a crushed forehead. But based on the results of the autopsy, the report states that Jenny died from hitting the back of her head. But they stated that, Joselito strangled the victim But no marks of strangulation were found on the neck of the victim. Papa, I know how to play the piano. Like this. And this. My Yesha is so talented. Papa I know you didn't do a bad thing Thank you. Let them have their rest. Yes, sir. Joselito, visiting hours are over. Goodbye, Papa. Goodbye. Promise me you will eat well. Yes, I will. I'll see you again. Papa! 1…2…3! Papa. Sol. Here's a letter for you. Thank you. Y-your ch-chi-children a-and I… Jeez, boss, how many hours are you going to read that? How are you, Soliman? Your children and I are in good health. Before school starts, we will come visit you. You will be surprised to see Junior had gotten so tall. He's a young man now. Don't forget to take good care of yourself. We love you very much. Thank you, Soliman. God bless you and your kind heart. All done! Papa, how are you doing? I sent this letter so you will always think of me. I miss you so much, Papa. I am doing fine in my new school. I made new friends. I will visit you again soon. I love you very much. Hey! Look at my daughter. Baby Grazella is so cute! Baby Rose Grazella! Isn't she cute? She's so cute. She doesn't look like you. W-what? You done with the toilet? Are we going to join the talent contest at the Christmas party? Do we have a talent? We can just sing! Sailor Moon! Right! Sailor Moon! Complete with dance moves! Five, six, seven, eight! Ha! You're all crazy! You better not copy our dance moves! Papa, I have a surprise for you. Is it a piano? No, it’s not. Surprise! Impressive! My Yesha is so smart! Do we have a pardon? No. They have set a date. December 23rd. December 23rd? It's Christmas time. Zero considerations? That's the word. They want it over and done with. They couldn't delay it till after Christmas day? We should protest. A forceful nudge from Yulo for sure. We have folks out there with death sentences who are still alive. They're really pushing the guy. Poor thing. He probably doesn't even realize his days are numbered. We must do something for both of them. This. This is what we're going to do. We're going to draw a picture? What is that? Is that ice cream? Oh, you're right… That looks like the lollipop I gave Yesha. No, you idiots. Leave it to me. I'm asking you earnestly. I'm really sorry, sir. We still need to get the permission from the principal. I'm begging because… this will be the last time Yesha gets to be with her father. We won't make it. We'll just improvise. Let's weave them all together. That works. We already have baskets, ropes. That should do it. What about the helium? And the materials for the balloon? Right, what about those? I need your help. What's in it for us? Whatever you like. Every sale that goes through this building is mine. All yours. I need materials: yards of cloth, sewing kit, and helium. You got it. The night is peaceful All the world is still Even the stars in the dark blue sky Yesha knows what to do. - As though it were in love - Alright, get ready. - As though it were in love - Okay, tell 'em. with the quietness of the whole world A time of peace is the soul of life God's blessing to all mankind The night is peaceful All the world is still Even the stars in the dark blue sky Come over here.

Help me! Help me! Help me! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Help me. Yesha! Help me! Sorry! Help me! Sorry! - Papa, I will come back. - Sorry! - Please don't cry, Papa. Sorry. Sorry. Sir Johnny. Sir Johnny, please. Sir Johnny. Yesha! I stand before you today, not only as Joselito Gopez's lawyer but also as his daughter. In my whole life I have never met anyone as innocent as my father was. The only fault he had was that his mind was weak. He did everything he could-- everything to ensure no harm would come to his daughter even if it meant sacrificing himself and the truth. I implore you to again look closely at the evidence. Because even if Joselito is gone It matters that the truth should triumph for all that remains to him is the integrity of his character. And I am certain that if he were here with us right now he would easily choose forgiveness, despite all he had to endure. What he may have lacked in mental capacity he more than made up for with goodness of heart It has been a miracle to witness his life. He touched each one of us and changed the way we understand life. He changed each one of us and the way we see our lives. The accused, Joselito Gopez - due to his intellectual disability, due to the forceful manner by which his statement was taken, due to evidence ignored by earlier investigations, the court hereby acquits the accused, Joselito Gopez, of the offenses as charged So ordered. One... two... three! Papa. Yesha! Pa! Life's better with music. Makes you happy, right? I don't want my Yesha to be sad. Goodbye, Yesha! Goodbye, Papa!
