Lila. You're in the hospital. You had an accident, but everything's OK. You're fine, don't worry. Lila, sweetheart. Do you know who I am? Do you know your name? Hi. I'm Blanca. I'm a friend of yours. Yesterday I went to your house to talk to you about work. While I made calls, you went down to the beach. You were taking too long, so I went to look for you. Then I saw you'd fainted in the water. Do you like it? I make them myself. I can teach you, if you want. It's easier to undo it, and then redo it again. We can follow the pattern and make it like it was before. Do you know who it is? It's... Shakira. Do you know who she is? Lily. Lila Cassen. Don't worry, Lila. Who are you? I'm Blanca. - You're Blanca. - That's right. - Are you my friend? - Yes. - Do I have a house? - Of course. Then I want to go home. WHO WILL SING TO YOU Did you picture it like this? I didn't picture anything. It will be just the two of us. I told César to take some time off. - Who's César? - Your personal assistant. A house like this needs people to take care of it. While he's gone, I'll take care of everything. I'm going to make something to eat. Do you want some crudités? Some what? Some crudités. Raw vegetables. Carrots, celery, cucumber. Raw. Why raw? Because you're a raw food vegan. - I'm what? - A raw food vegan. You eat raw things because you think it's better for your body. Meat, too? You don't eat meat. Want me to make you something else? A fried egg? OK, I'm going to the kitchen. Take a look around the house. - I'll get you in a bit. - Blanca. Yes? Where's the bathroom? What did you want to talk about? What? Before I went to the beach and you found me in the water. You said you came to talk about work. But... I'm retired. You don't have to worry about that right now. When should I start worrying? I planned to wait a few days to discuss it. I... I'd rather discuss it now. OK. You haven't sung in ten years. You've just been living off of album royalties, but that's not so easy now. Without doing concerts, it's almost impossible to live off of music. Or at least, live this way. So we scheduled your return to the stage. Ten concerts, for now. The first is in two months, in Madrid. What if I don't sing again? First, you'd have to sell this house. Then there are several options. You could disappear, start a new life away from it all. Or make a living on talk shows. Lots of singers end up doing that. But it's because they need to, and you don't. - Why not? - Because you have talent. Then why did I stop singing? Because your mother died. I've been with you for 25 years. I'm not leaving you now. No one matters to me as much as you. No one matters more to me than Lila Cassen. Naked This golden Tissue to Where my Hand reaches I'll whisper again At your side We're a new guest I'll whisper... It was my secret. You hate tobacco. Do you mind? Nobody becomes Lila in one day. Not even you. Since I woke up at the hospital, I feel a... A rhythm, constantly. It's a faraway song that echoes in everything. In the floor, in the walls. I want to listen to it, but I can't. I can only feel it. Like a heartbeat. All the time. Can you feel it? Because it's going to burst my insides. Do you know what a tomato with a cape and a mask is? No. Supertomato. And a potato with a cape and a mask? Superpotato. No. A potato dressed up like Supertomato. That's awful. You're the one who told it to me. And who am I? You're unique. LILA CASSEN UNIQUE Naked This golden Tissue To where my hand Reaches I'll whisper again At your side We're a new guest Give me back the air That you brought close Grab my hair Swim through me If you find no water Spread your wings Fly to me Fly to me The beast is on my side You must have heard it a thousand times. - Excuse me? - You look a lot like a singer. Oh, yeah? Tina Turner? Close. But the one I mean is Spanish. She was famous in the 90s, they say she eats live animals. That's what they say? That's what I've heard. I still don't know who. Her name starts with an L. No clue. She's got a song called "Wild Orchid." If you guess right, then I'll leave you alone. Lila Cassen. That's it. Then I'll hold up my end, and be on my way to the bathroom. I thought I'd found another Lila Cassen fan in some lost club in Rota and I just had to meet her. You're a Lila Cassen fan. A big one. A big one? If you were a Lila Cassen fan, you wouldn't have used "Wild Orchid" as an example. Why not? Because it isn't hers. It's a cover. It was Lisa Tornatto's, from the 60s. Whoops. And you would have never mentioned the urban myth about live animals. That's taboo. I confess, I'm an accidental fan. What's that mean? I have Lila Cassen's albums, but they were left by my ex. She never came back for them. Then either she wasn't a big fan or you were an awful boyfriend. So why is a horrible boyfriend, accidental Lila Cassen fan, in Rota? I sell dolls. You know the TV show “Chorly y Procket”? The series with hidden Satanic messages? That's an urban myth. I owed you, because of the live animal thing. Well, I'm the merchandising boss. There's a convention in Cadiz. What do you do at a doll salesman convention? Mainly sell licenses to make all sorts of useless shit. Phone cases, slippers, T-shirts... We get advice from educators so we won't feel so miserable. What kind of advice? For example, what the dolls say when you push their tummy. I've got the perfect thing for your dolls to say. Are you an educator? No. What do you do? I work at a karaoke bar. I'm all ears. "You're probably mediocre and run-of-the-mill. Don't waste your time on effort, or trying to be special. Spend it accepting reality. That way, even if you're not entirely happy, at least you won't be miserable the rest of your life." What do you think? A little long. But I think every child in Spain should hear that message. I'm going to the bathroom, then to dance. Will you dance with me? No. But I might watch you from up here. It's been a pleasure. I'm Nicolás. I'm Violeta. If you try it, you can shine. What happened to the door? Marta, I'm talking to you. It broke. I can see that. What I want to know is how it broke. Did it break on its own? Could you throw the shells in an ashtray? Forget it, I'll do it. I need a new phone. You bought one last year. Did it break on its own, too? It's not broken, but it takes fucking shitty pictures. The pictures are worse one year later? No, but everyone else's phones take better pictures. Fine. If you're in the picture, I'm sure it isn't shitty. Are you screwing with me? No, Marta. That was a compliment. Less compliments, and give me more money. I'm talking to you. What can I say, Marta? I told you: get a job like me. The last thing I want is to be like you. What are you doing? If you won't give me money, I'll find it on my own, don't worry. Stop it, Marta. - Where's your card? - There is no card. What do you mean? The bank cancelled it. I've been paying off the debt for the past two months. - Then take your money out. - I don't have any money here. - You don't have money in the house? - No. Mar...! Marta! - Marta, stop for a second. - Don't touch me! Touch me and I'll fucking go nuts. Don't even think about touching me. Where is it? There is no money, Marta. Where is it? I'm being serious. Fucking liar. Who told you I've got money here? I know you do. Now you know I know, too. So quit lying and give me the fucking money. Marta, there is no money. Where's the money? Don't start with that. I will start. Where's the fucking money? Marta, stop it. You're going to hurt yourself. You don't think I'd do it? You don't think I would, do you? Marta! I'd do it just to fuck your life over. So how's that. It's in Lila's album. Why do you always lie to me? Always! "For wonderful Violeta." Why'd you buy it if you don't even have a record player? To talk to her. Think twice next time you lie to me. FOR WONDERFUL VIOLETA LILA I'll follow The trail blindly I'll find you I'll rise high I'll plummet, and I'll find you Like an animal In combat, I'll find you I felt the wind On my face I saw the wolves Go by In the darkness I tried to breathe And I began to tremble You'll go by unseen And I'll find you Escorted by your guardians I'll find you Like a desperate animal I'll find you I felt the wind On my face I saw the wolves Go by In the darkness You drink from the spring Like a cursed animal Like an animal Like an animal Like an animal Like an animal Like an animal Like an animal Like an animal Hello? Sorry to bother you. I was walking down the beach and I saw you in the distance. Don't you work at the karaoke bar? I wanted to tell you that I loved your performance. I'd never seen anyone do one of Lila's songs so well. Thank you. My name's Blanca. Violeta. Are you...? - Are you Blanca Guerrero? - Do you know who I am? Of course. Wow. When you're with Lila, not many people notice you. I'm Lila. I mean, I'm a huge fan of Lila. I really am. I always have been. I believe you. Do you know anywhere open around here? I feel like a drink before I go home. These last few weeks I haven't had much time to relax. Well... sure. I'll explain. There's a hotel on this beach. The cafeteria is always open. - You have to go all the way... - No. No. I'm asking if you want to have a drink with me. I haven't come to Rota in years. My mother was from Jerez de la Frontera and my father from Sabadell. We lived in Barcelona, but we came down to visit my grandparents every summer. I had an American boyfriend here. Well, boyfriend... Friend. He brought me tons of records. Things that were impossible to get here. His name was... James. One of Lila's makeup artists lives here, and I needed to see him. Final arrangements for the concert. You have a ticket, right? I bought it as soon as they went on sale. Do you want me to send you one, is there anyone you want to invite? No, thank you. - Do you live in Rota? - Yes. But you don't look Andalusian. No, I'm from Madrid. I moved to Rota ten years ago. With my daughter. How old is she? - Twenty-three. - Twenty-three? - You were young when you had her. - Yes, I was. I don't have children. I've never had a maternal instinct. Or if I did, it all went to Lila. You've never thought of being a singer? I'm happy just singing Lila's songs. I don't need anything else. I was thrilled when I heard she was performing again. I was at the hospital when she got out. Thank you. It was nothing, just low blood pressure. Yeah, I read that. But I have to confess: when I saw her passed out in the bathtub, it gave me a good scare. In the bathtub? I thought she fainted on the beach. That's what we told the press. They misinterpret anything having to do with bathtubs. Oh, no... Is something wrong? No, but I have to go. Sometimes I feel like a babysitter. No, you don't have to. You have a whole glass of whiskey. It was a pleasure to meet you, Violeta. Likewise. Maybe I'll see you again. Blanca... Is she OK? Better than ever. Hi. Hi. Mind if I sit? I guess. I'm Álvaro. I'm a journalist. I saw you with Blanca Guerrero, and I thought... Is it her, or not? It's her! Because it's been impossible. Impossible to get a hold of her, with what happened, all the mystery. Right. So I thought, "Álvaro, it won't hurt to walk over to..." - What's your name? - Violeta. It won't hurt to walk over to Violeta, and talk to her. I don't deny I'm a journalist. I told you that up front. But I'm also a fan of Lila, and maybe you know how she's doing. If she's OK, if she's not OK. Are you and Blanca friends? No. What were you doing with her? I don't think that's any of your business. Well... OK, let's see. This is my number, OK? If you want to tell me something about Lila that could interest me, you can just... call this number. Not interested, I'm sorry. Really? The magazine is very generous with its collaborators. I said no. Well, at least I tried. Goodbye. She said no. I told you that maybe I'd see you again. I wasn't entirely honest with you. Álvaro, the guy who went up to talk to you, isn't a journalist. He's one of my assistants. Lila didn't faint in the tub, she passed out on the beach. I needed to know how much I could trust you. I also wasn't honest when you asked if Lila was OK. What I'm about to tell you, only Lila, our lawyer, and I know. I hope it stays that way. Lila has amnesia. It's been hard for me to be honest with myself. To me, Lila will always be a star. But I have to face reality. And the reality is, this is her last chance. If we cancel her concerts, her career's over. It's that simple. Why are you telling me all this? Because I want you to help Lila. If Lila can't remember that she's Lila, we need her to learn how to be her. And she wants you to be the one to teach her. Thank you. Violeta, this is Lila. Hi. Blanca told me you have a daughter. Yes. What's her name? Marta. The day she was born was the first time I heard you sing. Really? It was the happiest day of my life. Of course. Having a child must be beautiful. I've brought Violeta up to date, and she understands that we need to be discreet. No one can know about this. Not your friends, not even your daughter. Thank you for your help, Violeta. You're welcome. The media can't connect you to Lila, so we'll do it like today. You'll meet Olga, our lawyer, in the Caribe Hotel parking lot, and she'll bring you here. We know you've never had voice or dance lessons. So, please know that both Lila and I will help you with anything you need. Thank you. Is everything clear? Yes. Lila? Lila? Everything clear? Crystal. Could you stop for a moment, please? Small blue flowers Burn on my feet Let's go outside soon Sorry. Are you OK? Yeah, it's just that... I'm not doing it right. I'm really sorry. Do you want us to take a break? No, we haven't even gotten started yet. It's just a little difficult with you in front of me. You think it's going to bother me? No, it's not that, really. It's just that... I'm embarrassed. It's silly. - I'm sorry. - Don't apologize. Yeah, sorry. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Did you ever imagine this moment? The moment we met. Once or twice. Tons of times. But we already met once. - Really? - Yes. But I doubt you remember. - Sorry. - It's okay. Was I nice? Yes. But we didn't have much time, you signed a record for me. Was it how you had imagined it? Not exactly. How had you imagined it? Come on. No. It's too embarrassing. OK, I'll tell you something about myself if you want. And then you tell me. Ask me anything you want. You don't eat live animals, do you? What? Sorry. It's an urban myth. I never believed it. An urban myth? Yeah, but don't worry. Not many people know it. Aren't you afraid? Of pretending to be someone you're not. Yes. I'm afraid. But not of that. Of what, then? I still don't know. And that's better, for the time being. Your turn. God! OK. I'll tell you. I'm working late in the karaoke bar, and your car gets a flat nearby. Your driver is waiting for the tow truck, and you come inside the bar because you need to go to the bathroom, and it's the only place open. You come through the door, and I get super nervous. But I hide it the best I can. I go up to you, and congratulate you for your work. But I'm calm. Like we're equals. And how would you do that? Well, I'd tell you: "I love 'The Inverted Flight'." What's "The Inverted Flight?" It's one of your songs, but not many people know it. Not even I do. Then, you give me your number. You ask me to call you so we can get a drink one day. Did I invite you to my house, or did we meet up somewhere else? At your house. Well, now you're at my house. Shall we continue? - Hi. - Hi. - You staying for lunch? - Yeah. Mom... Yes? I... I'm sorry. It's fine. Did you buy the phone? - Does it take good pictures? - Yes. I'm glad. I'd like to pay you back bit by bit. You don't need to. Come on, bring glasses and silverware. What's your favorite color? Pink. Your favorite food? Avocado tartar and nuts. A perfect vacation? In Iceland. - A book. - "A Mortal Spring." - Record? - "Thriller." A movie. "The Naked Island." - What do you hate most in people? - Being fake. - What you most like in people? - When... LILA CASEN IS UNIQUE I can't remember. Manners. That's right. Isn't that a bit contradictory? What? That you hate fake people the most, but then you like manners the most. Having manners means being a little fake, doesn't it? I guess you're right. Why are you learning the answers? Why don't you say how you feel now? Are you afraid the answers won't match? No, it's not that. - Well, then? - Well... I just don't know the answers. Let me see. What's your favorite color? Navy blue. - Your favorite food? - Fried eggs. A perfect vacation? In Rome. When did you start singing? That question isn't on the test. I know. But I'm asking you. I think... At my friend Susana's house. We wore her mom's clothes and pretended we were the Goggi Sisters. We had a blast. We did concerts at her house and we invited the whole class. We charged entry, too. Candy, comics... Her mom was nice, she went along with it. But her house always smelled weird. Like a cat. What's your favorite color? Navy blue. I'll finish this and make dinner. I want to wrap up the last week before the concert. We'll have to go to Madrid to see the stylist and the photographer. We'll have to talk about how to do interviews. Who did I imitate when I was little? What? When we met, what songs did I sing? They were your songs. You wrote them, you composed them, you sang them. That's why you were so special. Because you didn't copy anyone. Don't think about who you imitated when you were a girl. Think about the girls who imitate you. Because now there's no cold or pain Because now there's no cold or pain Because Now There's no cold Or pain Or pain That was good. No, I'm starting over. That was shit, OK? You've done it six times in a row. - Maybe you should take a break. - Don't stop the music. Violeta, it's not good. It's not good, can't you see that? Look at my steps. Look. Look at me. What is this? What is this? I look fucking lame. What are we even doing here? Tell me. What are the two of us doing here? We're trying... It's impossible. Impossible for me to be that woman again. I know you can do it. You just have to try, relax and enjoy. You know I can do it. Great, I'm so relieved, having your approval. You sing on a karaoke stage and now you think you're an expert. Sweetie, you haven't got a clue. I'm sorry, Violeta. I don't know what's wrong with me. You do look pretty lame. Yesterday I was going to say goodbye And I didn't have the courage There was so much love in your eyes It's so easy to say goodbye So easy to forget It will be so hard for us both Who will sing to you With this guitar? Who will play it When I'm gone? Who will give your house color And warm your bed? Who will make love to you? Who will sing to you With this guitar? Who will play it When I'm gone? Who will give your house color And warm your bed? Who will make love to you? You know why you're my best friend? Why? Because you're the best person I know. You're a good person, too, Marta. - No. - Yes. You are. - Slap me. - What are you talking about? - Slap me. Like this. - What are you doing? - It's not hard. Slap me. - Stop it. What's up? How are you? I was looking for you, I wanted to tell you something. What? Last week, when you called your boyfriend, and he said he was with Omar and the guys... It wasn't true. What are you talking about? What? I was sucking him off in the bathroom. I feel so much better now! Man, I needed to tell you. What the fuck is your problem? What? You want more? Sure. Fuck! Hit me! Fuck! Marta! Where is our mistake with no solution? Were you the guilty one, or was it me? Not you, not anyone can ever make me change A thousand bells toll in my heart It's so hard to ask for forgiveness Not you, not anyone can ever make me change - Can I help you? - What? What do you need? - Is Violeta here? - No. She isn't working today? She's normally here Mondays, but she had to quit work a few days. Why? Are you her friend? Her mother, she's sick and she has to take care of her. Do you want to leave a message for her with me? Are you OK? Do you want a drink? Where is our mistake with no solution? Were you the guilty one, or was it me? Not you, not anyone can ever make me change Good morning. Good morning. Did you go out last night? Yeah. I'm exhausted. I'm making chocolate milk and going to bed. Lots of work? Sorry? I asked if there was lots of work at the karaoke bar. Yeah. Do you have Lady Gaga songs? Yes. I'd love to go to the karaoke bar one day and sing Lady Gaga. The one that says... Yeah, we've got that one. Maybe I'll drop by tomorrow. Better next week. This week we've got tons of bachelor parties, it's impossible to sing. Next week, then. That would be better. Like an animal Like an animal Like an animal Like an animal Like an animal Like an animal - How was that? - Perfect. I want you to come on tour with me. It'd be good to have you there, in case I need help. I'll tell Blanca tonight. Well... Well? What, you don't want to? Blanca thinks it's best if we stop seeing each other after this. I think so, too. Why? I'd have to lie to my daughter, and I don't want to do that anymore. But I have front row tickets for the Madrid concert. And I want Marta to come with me. Let's let some time pass. OK. But when the tour is over, I'll be going to watch you perform. Me? Are you going to stop singing my songs at the karaoke bar? No. Then one day I'll show up and surprise you, like in your fantasy. But if you're going to imitate Lila Cassen, imitate her for real. Pick the one you like best. No, no, no. Please. Thank you. No, Violeta. Thank you. Do you want to try it on? Let's go to the beach. Lila! Violeta, Olga is here! Lila! Hi. Hi. Thanks for fixing the glass. You're welcome. Hey. Do you want to go to the Lila Cassen concert? The Lila Cassen concert? Yeah, the first one in her tour, in Madrid. I thought we could spend the weekend there. We could go to the Prado Museum, or the Retiro. We haven't been back since we left. I went with Diana last year. Right. I meant together, we haven't been together. Besides, I've already been to the Prado and I didn't like it. I saw a painting of a guy eating his son. How gross! We could see "The Lion King". I have a better idea. Sure, what? If we want to see Lila Cassen, we could just go straight to her house. Why do you say that? You don't know what I'm talking about? You don't know what to say, do you? Because I guess the truth would be too hard for you to tell me. How do you know...? I followed you. Why don't you trust me? Marta, I... Before you continue, I only ask that you tell me the truth. Please. Lila's agent came to see me a few days ago at the karaoke bar. Lila had seen me singing in one of my videos, and she wanted... What did she want? She wanted me to help her. For you to help her? You? With what? She wanted me to help her sing again. Why, did she lose her memory or something? I warned you. I warned you not to lie to me. I'm not lying. I swear. I swear on my life. She couldn't remember anything after she fainted on the beach. She didn't remember who she was. Or her songs. Nothing. I helped her sing again. Wait, because... I don't know if I'm understanding this right. You're telling me that you taught Lila Cassen her songs? Yes. You, my mother? My mother taught Lila Cassen Lila Cassen's songs. That's right. Oh, my God. But that... That's a big deal. That's a really big deal, Mom. We're going to hit the jackpot! What? Of course, Mom. Think about it. What do you mean? We can go on all the talk shows and tell the whole story. Can you describe the house? That's really important. Besides, it's great for her, with all the promotion for the concert. Everyone will be talking about her, about your story. Did you hook up with her? Well, we can insinuate. We don't have to say yes or no. I'll handle everything. Where's the Hello Kitty hairband? Is it here? It's not? Here. Have you seen my cell phone? Have you seen my cell phone? Fucking great! I'm talking to you! Would you mind answering me? Look at me when I talk to you! What's wrong? Now you're angry? You're acting superior? Don't you realize I'm doing it for us? No, I get this shit. You took it. You think she's your friend, is that it? I can't believe you're that stupid. Don't you get it? Don't you get it? She's using you. Keep my fucking cell phone and your friend! She doesn't give a shit about you and I don't either! Look... No way. My keys! My keys! My keys or I'll trash the house! I swear to God, I'll trash the house! You asked for it! My keys. My keys, or I slit my throat. I swear to God, I'll do it. I swear I will. Mom, I'll do it. I swear by all you hold dear, I am not joking around. Mom! Mom, I'll do it! Mom! Mom! I'll do it! Mom! Mom, I'll do it! Mom... Mom... I'll do it. I'm... going... to... do it. Do it. Lila? Violeta's here. We'll wait for you downstairs. Don't take too long. Today is the last day. Lila, are you OK? What happened? Lila... Blanca, I'm not going to be Lila again. Violeta, give us a moment, please. Sweetheart, I know you're nervous. I know you haven't sung in many years. But it's going to be OK. You don't need to worry. I'll be with you. I've always been with you. I know. And I'm sorry. Sorry for what? I'm sorry I can't give you back the ten years you spent at my side. But I can stop you from wasting another ten waiting for something that will never happen. Waiting for what, Lila? I've been with you all this time for you. Because I want to help you. I understood the first year after your mother died. I got worried the second. The third, the fourth, the fifth... Ten years wondering what had happened. What I'd done so wrong that you couldn't even tell me why you didn't want to sing again. All that time with you and I never asked for any explanation. So please don't tell me I was expecting something when all I've done this whole time is try to protect you from something that I don't even know what it is, because you've never told me. I'm sorry. Stop saying that. I don't want you to be sorry. I want you to be Lila again! But I can't. Why not? If I leave, you'll never see me again. I want you to understand that. I understand. It may be easy to stop being Lila. But I doubt you can live without singing. I try to forget you Following the path of a wounded bird I try to stay away From those places where we loved each other What's that song called? It doesn't have a title. Did you write it? Yes. Why doesn't it have a title? I had to quit singing when my daughter was born, to care for her. How strange. What is? I had to start singing to care for my mother. I didn't know that. No one does. Look behind the picture. It took me three years to find them all. I destroyed all of them. Except that one. I couldn't. Who is it? My mother. My mother wanted to be a singer. My mother was a singer. She liked writing songs, composing them... She saved some money and made a demo. That's it. Lili Cassen. A small record company promised her a single. But it all stopped there. She stopped there. Like the majority, at a promise. My mother, besides a singer, was a heroin addict. I started imitating my mother. In class. At parties at the end of the school year... It reminded me that she used to be someone else. Someone who didn't disgust me. I won my first contest when I was eighteen. Ten thousand pesetas. Money to sing, I couldn't believe it. I signed up for every music contest I could, and I won almost all of them. In one year I saved enough to put my mother in rehab. My mother quit heroin. Then Blanca came along. My first record was number one in Spain. It was an exact copy of my mother's demo. The same songs, sung by me. My mother was happy, because her songs had seen the light, thanks to her daughter. I remember the day I told her she wouldn't be in the credits. I convinced her that we were both Lila. She didn't say anything. She just smiled. She knew she owed me that. I knew she owed me that. It was our secret. Blanca never knew anything. Years passed, and we recorded more albums. She wrote each and every one of Lila's songs, and was never in the credits. I sent her all the money she needed and that was it. When we got started on the fifth album, I found out she was shooting up again. I wasn't worried about her. I didn't even think of checking her into rehab again. All I worried about was going on TV and saying she was a drug addict, that I copied her, that she wrote my songs. I was trapped and I hated her for that. I ended up hating her so much... One night, after releasing the fifth album, I went to see her for her birthday. You know what I gave her? You know what I gave my mother for her sixtieth birthday? Ten grams of heroin. The next day, they called me to say my mother had died of an overdose. Lila died the day my mother died. I'll see you in the rehearsal room in a half hour. Why? We have a day of work left. What are you doing? We have to finish rehearsing. Why are you doing this?

Then call yourself. Trust me. I try to forget you Following the path of a wounded bird I try to stay away From those places where we loved each other I tangle in loves With no will, no strength, to see if I can forget you And night comes And I understand again that I need you I try to forget you Doing thousands of different things during the day I try to forget you Counting and stepping on the fallen leaves. I try to tire myself Barely alive when night falls And when I see our home So lonely, silent, I don't know what I would do What I would do for you to be there For you to still be with me What I would do to not feel this way To not live like I'm lost I try to forget you Following the path of a wounded bird I try to stay away From those places where we loved each other I tangle in loves With no will, no strength, to see if I can forget you And night comes, and I understand again That I need you What I would do for you to be there For you to still be with me What I would do to not feel this way To not live like I'm lost I'm lost
