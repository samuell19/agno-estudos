Please understand. Couldn't you give us a bit more time? I'm sorry, my hands are tied, Mrs. Stahlbaum. A contract is a contract. Mama, Mama, did you see me? Aunt Agatha said I did beautifully, and then Frau Muller said I was great! - Oh. - Uh, Marie, this is our guest, Mr. Ratter. He owns the pawnshop. - Hm. - He told me he enjoyed your performance. Oh, yes! I've never seen such exquisite dancing. A pleasure to make your acquaintance, my dear Marie. Really? Not very pleasurable to me. Please forgive my daughter, Mr. Ratter. She's been under some stress. I assure you, there's nothing to apologize for, madame. As you know, my lovely Marie, your dear late father, when he left us, also owed me a bit of money, about 100,000. - And it's time to pay me. - What? We don't have that much! I know that. Do you think I'm foolish? But wouldn't it be a shame if a girl as pretty as yourself were cast out to the streets, while her mother rotted away in debtor's prison? Though I'm sure I could be swayed otherwise. I'd wipe out the debts if you'd agree to be my wife. That's it! You've said enough, get out! You realize this expensive purchase would help you both out. No, not a chance! I'd go to jail first! I expected a bit more gratitude. Oh, I'm certain that once you taste poverty you'll be running back to me. Well, Marie, the choice is yours should you choose to save her. But don't wait too long. I'll be back tomorrow to hear a yes, no doubt. And you can have this while you think about it. He's called the Nutcracker. I hope it reminds you of me. Good evening, Madame Stahlbaum. Indeed! Mama, what are we supposed to do? Don't worry, Marie. It will be okay. I'm sure. You're as awful as the man who gave you to me. ♪ Alone at my window ♪ ♪ Here to grieve ♪ ♪ I can't believe ♪ ♪ It's Christmas Eve ♪ ♪ Snow's falling gently from the sky ♪ ♪ My joy's gone by ♪ ♪ Please tell me why ♪ ♪ Time, why do you slip away? ♪ ♪ It's not okay ♪ ♪ Seems it was only yesterday ♪ ♪ I was at play ♪ ♪ Don't go away ♪ ♪ Oh, to be back when things were clear ♪ ♪ When I felt cheer ♪ ♪ Those happy years ♪ Oh, my old play things.

Sophie, get all our things ready. But, ma'am, can nothing else be done? No, Sophie, not at all. Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! - Huh? - Mama, mama! Did you hear that? No, ma'am, nothing. Sounds like squeaking. May be rats. Goodness, our lovely house is just falling apart. Bring the cat in from outside. He'll take care of them. It's me! It's no use. So, I'm small, but I don't have to marry anyone. Whoa! Hi-ya! Hm. Whoo! That's what I call a fight! Curly, could it really be, you're alive?! Yep, I'm just as alive as you. Don't know what happened, but I'm not about to complain. It's really no surprise. Miracles happen at Christmas! And Christmas Eve is tonight! Something magical happened when you sang that song, bringing to life some of your old friends. Huh? Red Beak? Is that you? What's up with that guy? Everyone knows, ostriches bury their heads in sand when there's danger near. And, uh, for lack of sand, he seems to have found the nearest object. What happened? Are we safe now? Yeah, the coast is all clear, Braveheart. I-I knew that, of course. Just never hurts to have an overabundance of caution. Better than butting our big heads into foolish situations anyway, hmm? - But what do I know? - What's that supposed to mean? Huh? And what about me? What's gonna happen to me? I wouldn't fret, Marie. Magic is not forever. When the new sun rises on Christmas morning, the spell will be lifted. And you will be as you were before. Hm? Who's that? Yes, who is that? Is that the Nutcracker? Thanks for your help back there, sheep dude. Thank you for saving me from that rat. Me? I didn't save anyone. You got it all wrong. I just really hate rodents. - Hm. - Uh... My name's Marie. And, uh, Nutcracker? Nah, not Nutcracker. Uh, hm... - Suleiman? - Antonio? - Jackie? - Big Ben? I... I don't remember my name. Wait, who am I? I just remember I don't like rats and I must fight them. Ah! So there's where I'm headed. Nice meeting you, everyone. Merry Christmas, kind sir! Nice one. I think his brain is still wooden. Hang on. My name is George. What? No need to stare. Yes, I know it's nice. Come back! Marie, help me stop him! Wait, why though? We must stop him from going! Otherwise, the spell won't lift! Uh, what do you mean? In order for the spell to be broken, everyone who was here when it was cast must stay here! George! Hurry, Marie! We must bring him back before dawn's light! Marie, it seems like it could be scary! Please, watch out. Don't worry, we'll protect Marie. Leave it to us, old man. Red Beak! Curly! Huh? Hey, you're just the person I've been trying to find! I don't remember inviting you along. Look, here's the thing, you have to come back with me to my room, right now. We gotta go. And I definitely don't remember you being my boss. Excuse you. You're a toy and belong to me! - What? - Uh-huh. - But I'm no toy. - You are! You hear that? Huh? You guys, I think we need a place to hide. Halt! Halt! Is there a reason we've stopped, Mother? I could've sworn I caught the stench of something. Something loathsome and vile; humans. - I'm not a toy. - Shh! We're done! Finished! Humans? Are you sure, Mother? Smells more to me like chicken. Ch-chicken? Over there! Hiya! After them! Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Not a chicken! Not a chicken! Not a chicken! Not a chicken! Not a chicken! Not a chicken! Stop! Where'd it go? - I don't know! - Try that way! Oh, no-no-no-no-no! I said stop! I'm ready to become... Chickens can fly? Whoa! Hey, you! Someone nab that infernal bird! How? This is the last thing I need. On my command! I'm cooked! I knew I smelled bird. A trophy. Let's head back. Mother's been waiting quite a while. - What about our prey? - Eh, I don't wanna carry it back. You can come out now. All clear. Hm? Hm? Hey, buddy, you good? I said they're gone! He stuck? Please, come out. It's safe. We're okay now. I want to go home. Right now! I'm not suited for this sort of work. Huh. Uh... Let's just grab Sir Forgets A Lot and take him back. I'm done here. This sand... This riverbed... Huh, it almost feels as if I've been here before. Wha-- Whoa! Wait! No, no, no, no, no! A castle? I remember. I remember everything. I see it just like... yesterday.

This used to be my home. Now it's something else. A nest for rats. Can I clarify something? Your stepmother is some sort of shapeshifter, and that means she's really a-- - A rat. - Bleech! And those delinquents who were chasing me back there-- The same ones. I've gotta stop them all. But, George, what about me? Find yourself another toy. - I've gotta go. - What do you mean? We can't break the spell without you there. - Without me where? - My home! - My home is here. - No, this place is run by rats. - It's not yours now. - She's right. - There's so many. - Might be time to cut your losses, pal. - No, just let me go. - Look, I understand you're mad, but we need you back. That's what the astrologer said. - The old wizard? - We all have to be together before dawn's first light. That way I can be big again and it'll all go back to normal! - What if I don't want normal? - Careful! George! He's over here! He's not breathing. George. George! Hey, wake up! Come on! Don't do this! I need you to get back so I can break the spell! This isn't fair! Please! Come on. I'm so lost here. Well, that's it. Guess he's dead. Yep, that simplifies things. - What do you mean? - The wizard said to bring him back to the room. We can still do that. But he never specified we had to bring him back alive. Oh, that makes sense. What's wrong with you? He isn't a toy, he's a real person! Well, he used to be. Not so much now. Could put all this behind us. - Yeah? - Uh-huh. - Please, excuse my interruption. - George? - Huh? - George is back! Who are you guys? Poor guy forgot everything again. We're your most trusted advisors. - Huh? - And we're going home. - And the rats? - We defeated all of them. - Yep. - Yeah. Every last one. It was a crazy battle. Huh? My advisors called me "Your Highness". - Uh... - And you are a terrible liar. Ohh, he's a sneaky one. Marie, he remembers. Look, I'm sorry. Let's start over again. Do we look like rats to you? - No. - So let us help you defeat them. Oh! And in return, you come back home with us. Before morning. Cool? You want to help me? - Uh-huh. - Against those monsters. Wait, I never said that. Well, looks like helping you is the only choice I've got. All right, on one condition: No more shady deals with the bird while I'm unconscious. It's creepy. Okay? Hm. That's it then. Let's go. Go where? What exactly are we doing? You do have some sort of plan for this, right? I... I just like to plan ahead. First, I'll find where my father is. Mother! Mother, come look! The king, he's awake! I don't know what's going on, but he's coming to his senses! What's going on?! Haven't you been giving him the right sleeping potion? Well, I tried to-- This fool. Potion! You're as useless as the rest. Everything feels foggy. Like a bad dream. Charlotte! My sweetheart! I've been seeing people around the castle who look like rats, - but I can't remember-- - For the last time, you still need to recover from your illness. Why don't you take a rest? I... I've been ill? Oh, terribly so, I'm afraid. And you're still quite weak, dear. Oh, my head does feel quite muddled. I have your medicine right here. Huh? Ahh. There's something I can't find. I feel you'd recover faster if you heard your beloved flute. - Do you know where it is? - Huh? Ahh... You... will tell me! This wind will blow and songs will play And you, my son, will grow each day That stupid brat! Forget this son of yours, because you're never going to see him again as long as you live. He'll remain a toy and my son will be the king. Your land belongs to us now. There are so many guards. Isn't there another way in? Nope, not unless you wanna get skewered today. So, what makes this way so much better? It's a secret tunnel. It'll go right underneath the castle and lead us out at the royal crypt. Royal crypt? Like dead people? Calm down, I'm sure there won't be too many zombies. Very funny, mutton chops. Now I've gotta look out for zombies, too? The dead don't bite. It's the living you gotta watch out for. It won't budge. Prince? If I may, please. For the herd! Hm. And people always say I should use my head more. Huh? Huh? - Ram! - For the love of... Any one up for a late night ferry? I don't like this. Ooh, hey, if we're like an army going into battle, then maybe that means I can get some kind of cool military rank. I call general! Generally annoying is more like it. - You can be a captain. - Captain Curly. Yeah, all right.

Oh, are you hoping to end up here, too? Red Beak, stay close. Yeah, I just thought I saw something. There's no one in here but us. Let's hurry. Huh? Huh. Look at this, a cute little dog. Hi. Where are you from? A-ha! They're all ghosts! This way. You try and escape. I'll hold them off! George! - Uh... - George? George? Your name is George? My grandson? Ah, surely it's not the same George. He was merely a child! Well there s a way to find out. What did your grandmother call you then? Mm... Her little honey bun. Uh, huh? Oh! Welcome home, George! Aww, our little honey bun. Son, I'm your great-grandfather! I'm your great-great-grandmother, dear! I'm your great-uncle's cousin, twice removed! This is the strangest family reunion I've ever seen. Uh... And who is this charming young lady who you were defending so valiantly? Do you finally have a girlfriend? That's Marie. And no, Grandma, it's not like that. Pity. What are you doing down here? Shouldn't you be up in the castle? I would, but the castle's been taken over by rats! Rats? Ew, no plague today, thank you. - Disgusting! - Why would you let rodents run amok? Get rid of them! I'm trying, but how? Oh, if I remember correctly, there was an ancient magic my grandfather used. A-a-a magic... - Piano? - No, no. Something you blow into. - Flute? - You're right. A magic flute. Hm, a clever one! Clever enough for a future queen to be, no? Not now, not now. Where do I go? A chapel, pronto. I mean, for the flute. Ah. - Um... - Dinner is served, Your Highness. Uh, yes, Well, Grandma's got important business. Wait, come back! Where do I find the magic flute? - I don't remember. - Grandma, please! Your father knows, he remembers. All right, let's go hunt down a flute. Yes. We find my father, we find the flute. Thanks, Grandma! We'll send those rats back to the sewers they came from! Shh. Take that! Third time's the charm. Huh? Huh? Whoa! Hey, bring in them supplies. I need 'em, now. Food. Come. George! Are you there? - Yeah. - What's our plan? Four orders of roast turkey, extra garbage-y What? What's going on out there? Sounds like trouble. Oh, you're gonna get it. What's going on? Hey, who are you? You don't work here. Of course I do, I just started. - And you? - Our new assistant! And he's my assistant. Uh, same. And I'm... I'm a temp. Okay, carry on. What? A talking ostrich? Wait, but you're fine with a talking sheep? Huh? Been awhile since we caught up. Margaret? Oh! I thought I'd never see you again. Charlotte had me under some kind of spell, and I was turned into a nutcracker. We know. We heard everything. Who is we? We're humans left here when the rats came to power. Serving as cooks, or as guards, or like me, having to sew all the clothes for the rodent court and their awful wives. Huh? Oh, yeah. This is Curly, Red Beak, and Marie. She helped me regain my human form tonight. George and I used to be inseparable. The other kids used to make fun of us, sitting in a tree and all that. Our parents considered betrothal for a while actually. Huh? Huh? Quick, we need to get you all out of here. I'm gonna fix this and save you all, Margaret. But I need to find my father, to ask him where a magic flute is. Magic flute?! I just wanted a sample. Charlotte's been keeping your father locked away in the study by the ballroom. - But-- - But what? You won't like how things have become. How he's become. Bird-brain, hush! Tonight the castle's packed with guests. It's a masquerade party for Prince Philip's birthday. Now where is... Ah, you'll have to find a costume. Let's try in here. Sweet! Hope they got a captain's uniform in extra-large sheep size. This plan feels pretty ridiculous. Anything to get the job done. Huh? There. That hall in the back goes to my father's room. That's where we need to go. Ready? Let's-- Margaret! What are you doing here? How many times must I remind you? Humans are not to interact with our guests. Do you hear me? I shan't deal with your insubordination tonight. Bonjour. Forgive her, sir. - Silly humans. - Espresso. Back to work! Now! Such foolish creatures. How did they ever manage without rodents taking care of things? Hm. It's all so absurd. People serving rats. - Horrific. - It is. - Margaret was a princess before. Marie! Don't make me go in there! - Parties give me anxiety. - Shh. Everything gives you anxiety. - We're in disguise. - And us? What if you guys pretend to be our pets. Woof. Can I be a poodle? Whatever happens, just act natural. Like this? Heh... - Sure. Now you try it. - Try what, barking? - Act like a guest. - Hm. Puff out your cheeks. Like a rich rodent. Better. - Whoa. - Uh... Perfect. Despicably rodent-like. If only your Margaret could see you now. - Uh, yep, you look great. - Yeah... Let's go! Dearest... Today, we gather as our most regal mischief in celebration. We celebrate our beautiful future. - A future... - Hey, watch out for tails. ...gutters of society. A future in which all Rodentia take their rightful place at the top of the social food chain. - And at the helm... - I heard Queen Charlotte is going to hand the crown over to Philip... sooner than expected. - What about the old king? - He'll be dead soon. - Dead? - Dead? Who's that? I don't know. But he looks important. Let's hurry. It is now time for the royal dance! We're almost there. Time to dance! No, not this guy again! Hey, watch out! Whoa! Marie. Oh, so sorry, sir. Ah... Well, well, well. Who is this fine smelling rodent? Beg your pardon, Prince, I believe you're beneath my fiancée. - Huh? - Yes, that's right. You're engaged to this guy? - Yep. - Such a pity. No harm meant, whoever you are. So, help me. Act cool. Mm. Are you sure we haven't met? Come, here. Why do you smell like bird? Are you sure we haven't met before somewhere else? Let me think. Have we been hunting together? You look irritatingly familiar. I swear, your face is ringing a bell, but I can't place it. Excuse me, good sir. Let's have another dance. For the prince. - The prince? - If you could. - Anything for another human. - What? Your Majesty, please join me for a dance. It would be my honor. - The dance of the ostrich. - Ostrich? Interesting choice. - Won't your fiancé mind? - Ah, that guy? Please, pay him no mind, Your Majesty. Quit staring and go. Get out of here! And, lift off! Oh, goodness, okay. I remember... where I've seen him before. Your fiancé... is not who he says he is. He's dead. A dead ringer.... for our chimney sweep, Wilhelm! He looks just like the guy! A fiancé of the chimney sweep! Humorous as always, your highness. Father, I've returned! Do you remember me? Father, it's me! The wind will blow And songs will play And you, my son, will grow each day Though memories fade as time goes by I'll keep the ones of you and I Yes, father, yes, that's the lullaby you used to sing to me when I was little! You're my beloved, this I know No matter where you choose to go And I would live so happily If I could keep you close to me And see who you grow up to be And see... Who you... Father! You don't know what's going on. It was awful! Sneaking into a castle is one thing, but dancing in public is a whole other level of horror. Shh! There goes our lead on the flute. George... I'm sorry. Father! Huh? Huh-- wha--? I... I remember this star. Could he be giving us a sign? Look at this! Ooh! Ominous. Flute, flute, please tell me it's flute storage. Move your head, chicken brain! Ah... - Is that it? - Huh. A long nap, that was. Who dares awaken me from slumber?! Um... Nothing? Quiet bunch. Is it world-saving time? Huh? What're you lookin' at, Bo Peep? I got a loose paperclip or somethin'? It's just... you're talking paper. Wow, pot meet kettle, much? Anyway, I'm not just paper, I'm an ancient scroll! If a flute you may seek today Then find the room and don't delay No window and no door to boot Among the hundreds, there's your loot No windows or doors? I know! That's in the old tower! That might be where the flute is! - Right? - "You're smart! Ever considered scroll writing? To save the kingdom is our aim And kick those rats to whence they came Hey, easy on the pages, youngster, I'm over 100. Don't worry, Father. I won't let you down. Let's open that window, Philip, shall we? Trying to get the stench of human out of here. It'll be gone soon enough. Today's the day, my son. The day the crown finally sits where it should be after all this time. In a few hours from now... all this will belong to us. Hear that, old man? No one will need you anymore. I'll get rid of him myself, Mother. With you at the head of the pack, I believe rodent-kind shall see a glorious new awakening. Humanity's long rule is finally finished. You agree? Come.

I don't think... there are any flutes in here. Uh... hey, got any advice? First, I'd say go easy on the pages!

You're on your own. Hmm... Don't look down. Don't look down. Think of something to distract yourself. Like a problem. A-a problem? Try adding in your head. Five plus five. Sure, why not? Let's make the height worse by adding math to it! I have got to get down there. But how? It's way too far. - You won't survive. - Yep. He'll be flat like a bug. No choice. I'll find the flute no matter what. I have to save my father. - I won't let you! - Hey, what's that? - Here I go. - George! Hm. Stop that! You'll kill us! Can't you fly? - Flap your wings! - I'm trying! I'm trying! I'm doing it! I'm doing it! I'm not doing it. Well, I'll be. That was simple. Now, hurry up and play it. I've done enough work for a century. Ow. It's thorny. This thing is so overgrown. - It's impossible to-- - To what? You're welcome. Thank you. How does it work? I play it... and all of this ends. - And the rats will turn back? - They should. Uh, George. George, stop playing, stop! Stop! Uh... Uh, but... Uh-huh. Lots of flutes. Which one is the magic one? Hmm. Aren't you gonna help? Huh? Red Beak? - Ah, you're okay. - Good to see you too... buddy. - Are you, uh, all right? - Yep! I have this weird feeling. I'm... - What? - Not scared. It's bizarre! Is this what courage is? - Hold still up there. - Oh, hush, be patient. Hm? We better go. He'll alert the others. But what about saving your father? The kingdom? Your... people?

Ram-approved. Huh? Uh... Ho... Long time no see! Whoa... Huh, anyway... Red Beak? What's gotten into you? I told you, I'm not afraid of anything anymore! I'm like a whole new ostrich. I could really use some water, though. Hey, fellas. Lookin' good. - Hm? - Or not. Sheesh. We're here! We made it! Ooh, I am parched, Your Majesty. You mind if I just, uh... Cardio day, you know. What's your plan? Well, first we have to make sure we're properly hydrated before jumping into anything. Or maybe we should take a nap first. Red Beak, what on earth are you doing? We don't have time to be messing around! Hello? This is not sleepy time! Hello?! There you are. Okay, guess we're skipping peace talks and going straight to violence. How'd you like that, you nasty overgrown mice?! Uh... how about those peace talks? We're ready to begin. You've got this, right? We mustn't have any issues today. You understand why things need to go as planned. I'm sure that the queen will grant you a higher exposition. Frankly... I'd rather die. Huh? I mean... dying of excitement. Attention, ladies and gentlemice! I present to you, in our captivity, enemies of the state! Opponents to all rat-kind! Evening! Behold these weaklings, those who conspire against us, cowering beneath their king! Who is more worthy, descendants of apes, or rats? Father! Wake up! Please welcome our noble and benevolent ruler, the incomparable Queen Charlotte! For generations, we have searched for the location of the flute, a weapon that could bring our salvation... - Father! - ...or our end. Please, try! What's... huh? Why on earth is he stirring? Fetch his sleeping potion! Right away! Yes, your highness. However, lucky for us, the king's foolish son arrived and found it for us. Now! How kind! He came all this way to deliver us our most sought-after relic. - Thank you! - Bravo, George, bravo. Got it! Today, my son is finally of age, and shall assume the throne, in place of this old weakling! This is plain water. Long live King Philip! Long live the king! Long live the king! Father! Father! My son? You've grown up! And you're... flying? I must be dreaming. No, this isn't a dream! For once, you're awake! So all of this is... real life. All dissenters, all those who do not believe in our cause shall be punished! And what cause is that? Oh... Long live the king indeed. Would you care to explain all this to your king? Father, she has the magic flute! I see. Ah... That's not his sleeping potion, it's water! What potion? Never mind that. Let's discuss the flute, shall we? - If a human plays it-- - Rats assume their true form. But when it's played by a... Rat! What on earth is happening? The flute's secret is simple. If a rat plays the flute, humans become nothing more than our little playthings. Our slaves, bending to our every whim. You hear that, brother? You're my toy now! On your knees, all of you! Well, well, sitting this one out, are we? I don't blame you. What better time to nap than when your friends are in mortal danger?! My friends? Pity you don't have any sand to hide in. No more hiding. Not anymore. Hang on! Stay still. These knots are tight. And soon, our reign will cover the rest of the world! All humans shall bow down before us! - Not they won't! - Not if I can help-- Whoa, hey, what was that? Whoa! Heads up, sewer... I'm dead. The flute! No! Whoa! Yes! Oh, no. Stop them! No! My... flute! Marie, play it! Marie, hurry, end it! Marie? Uh, Marie, my dear. Give me the flute. I'll give you everything you ever wanted. You'll be a princess. Solve all your problems. Uh, yes, it's true. But what about-- Your Majesty. You do the honors. Here. Edward, don't, please. What about me, my love? It's time to right all their wrongs. No! Please! No! No, please! I didn't, I... They made me do it! They forced me to betray you, George! Don't you remember the good times we shared? Please! We used to be best friends! I didn't mean anything by it! No! You wanted to be princess of the rats. Now you have your wish. What an awful mess. It's done. Out with the pests. Your Majesty. Ah, Harold. My faithful jester. - You saved us all. - It was nothing. Thank you. Thank you, my friend. Let me at 'em, let me at 'em! I'll squish 'em all! Red Beak! You're okay! Hang on. Why'd it get so dark? Uh, little help here. Oh, you poor thing. We've done it! You did it, my boy. You all did. Father, I wanted to introduce you to Marie. She's the most wonderful person I've ever met. Look there. A glorious sunrise. What a beautiful morning to celebrate! Morning? Morning. But that means... We're too late. - What's wrong? - No time to explain. Marie! Maybe we can make it! I guess it was all a dream. Mama! I just had the wildest dream. Marie, my sweet child. I'm afraid Mr. Ratter is here. We need to pack our things. This isn't our home anymore. I'm so sorry we couldn't save it. Forgive me. Mama, don't. It... it isn't your fault. Ah, Marie! You look lovely as ever. Such a shame you're becoming homeless today. So it goes. - Mr. Ratter, I... - Hm? I've decided I'll be your wife. Oh! What a nice surprise. Well, I knew you had some sense in that pretty little head of yours. - Mm. - Absolutely not! Not a chance! Wh-what is the meaning of this?! - Beautiful morning, isn't it? - Huh? George! You're really here? Yes, Marie. It's me. Get out of here, young man! I don't think I have to. This house belongs to me! - Actually, no. - What? You, Mr. Ratter, are up to your ears in debt. Lucky for you, I've purchased all your debts this morning, along with Mrs. Stahlbaum's beautiful house. - But you-- - Leave before I call the police. You'll pay for this, you scoundrel! The spell has been lifted. We're free. And it's all thanks to you. So it wasn't a dream at all? The rats, and our adventure? No, silly. It wasn't a dream. You saved me, my father, our kingdom, - possibly even the whole world. - Saved? You saved somebody? Your daughter did all of that and more. I came to find you as quickly as I could. I had to say what I didn't get to tell you back in the dungeon. Marie, you are... ...the smartest, bravest, most interesting woman I've ever known, and I hope you'll do me the honor of becoming a princess. My father, King Edward, is waiting for us. King? - Ah... - Uh... Wait. - You're getting married? - We're invited, right? Red Beak! Curly! You're still here, you're not toys again? Real as can be! And did I mention I make an excellent grooms-ram? Oh, please, say I can be your flower-bird. But how are you...? Must have been the magic flute, Marie! The same magic that banished the rats gave us life! Is than an ostrich in my den? Yes, ma'am, but I promise, he's house-trained... mostly. Ah... Now this is flying!
