Ticket. Okay, get in the truck. You two related? What's in the box? Put it down. Pack it up! Where's the other one? What? The other ticket. I only have the two. Step back. Don't do this, please. Get back from the line now! Two tickets, two people! I'm all they have left! Do it now! I'll take them! I'll take them. Osenchuk. Right? Hi! This is William. You're William. Hello, William. He's three. This is his baby brother, Kris. You're Thomas Oates's wife, right? Was. Yeah. Get in the truck! Let's go! Janet. Janet. We have to do this. Shh. Shh. Okay. Okay. William, come on. Come on. Let's go for a truck ride. Don't ever let them come back. Come on. Here we go. Let us finish with a verse from Luke. "There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate full of sores. And it came to pass that the beggar died... and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried. And in hell he lift up his eyes, and being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom." Let us commend Olivia Osenchuk to the ground. Earth to earth. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. Amen. Have you seen Will? Will? Will? Are you up there? "Za world reveals itself to those who go searching." Who said that? I did. I meant who said that quote. Werner Herzog, of course. This your secret spot? Mmm. Since we were kids. Baba didn't notice? Actually, sometimes she'd join in. Kris has got a thing about weed. Kris has got a thing about a lot of things. And, uh, semi-naked thing, that just for kicks? Yeah, well, got to stay fresh and clean. Don't want to start stinking up the service. You know what else might help with that? A shower. I'm kidding. You smell great. I do smell great. Tell your friends. Thank you for coming. Be right in. What's up? Nothing. I know this is a hard day to go over all this stuff, but with you and Brit on your way out of town.. New York will still be there when this is done. It's, uh, better we deal with this now. We just appreciate you helping out on such a short notice. Will and I both, uh.. We both appreciate it. Yeah, of course. She was a good woman. All right. Contents declared.. familial possessions, all belonging to one Olivia Osenchuk. All to be received by the primary benefactor.. Kristopher Thomas Oates. You. You sign here and they're yours. I assume the items have, uh, sentimental value. Just a few photos, mementos, a videotape. Short straw kind of thing, huh? Hey, listen. Death is just a.. It's just a part of life, you know? A stroke's a stroke. You can't control these things. Best not to try. At least she didn't suffer. Casablanca? Why is that so important? Hey. Not now, Will. I'll walk you out. Thanks. It was a pretty service. You guys both looked so sharp. She would have liked that. Right. Hey. What's going on in that head of yours? We were so close. I know. Baba was a special lady. No. I mean we were so close. You and me. So close to gettin' away from all this. It's just life. It's nothing we can't handle. We'll just deal with the odds and ends and make sure your brother's all right.. That's the part that exhausts me. Making sure my brother's all right. That could take years. Hey, Will. How you doing? Just looking for a VCR so I can play Baba's videotape. So, it's Baba's relief bottle. There was a lot of junk out there. See what I mean? Yeah. Would it be so bad if we just took some time? Yes. Yes. Okay, we are not setting our plans off course. The firm was nice enough to give me a few extra days, and that's it. And quite frankly, I don't want to lag behind. We need to be solution-oriented. We need to move on. If we let the problems of this place weigh us down, then.. You got it to play? What? Oh, yeah. Couldn't sleep? Be patient with him. He struggles a lot trying to keep it all together. Yeah, well, he doesn't have to be an ass about it. Of course he does. What are we watching? Vacation tape? I don't know. It all seems to be taking place in this town Tendale. Whoa! Those are our parents. Our parents? It was in the box with the tape. That baby could be anybody. Oh. Well, when was it taken? August 23, 1988. That's your birthday, Kris. Yes. Thank you, Will. I got to call a real estate agent and list this place. Actually, I think you should probably hold off on that. Actually, I can't. Well, now, I mean, come on, hear me out. So we Google-mapped this town called Tendale. Which was actually surprisingly hard, since it was declared a distressed municipality 10 years ago. It's practically a ghost town. But a charming ghost town. Super charming. And-And-And they have this thing called "Sasquatch Watch," which is probably a tourist trap, but.. Okay, why are you guys telling me this? Okay. It's, like, an eight-hour drive away. Well, more like 10. But more like eight. And we were thinking of going and finding Mom and Dad. You wanna find the people that decided they didn't want us anymore? Right. Well, I mean.. No. Well, who knows what happened, right? Wouldn't you wanna know? You're not serious? He's not serious. We've all been through a lot. And you and I are heading back east next week. It might be nice to go on a little family vacation. What is wrong with you? Kris. It could be fun, all right? It's a.. It's a well-deserved break. From what? What do you need a break from? Kris! Everybody lost Baba. Not just you. Oh, come on. He's been the victim his whole life. Poor Will needs more help in school. Poor Will needs more confidence. Poor Will needs extra attention. Poor Will can't pay his rent. It's bullshit. He's almost 30 years old and he's still working for minimum wage. I chose a hard career. What career? I'm an artist! Okay, because you took an adult ed course at community college? And before that, what was it, um, a surf class in Nicaragua, was it? That was a viable business venture. You don't know how to surf. You know what? I'm goin' to Tendale. I'm gonna find Mom and Dad. I'm gonna do it alone if I have to. Okay. And who's gonna foot the bill on this pipe dream, now that Baba's gone? Me? You know what? This was your breakfast. I don't have to put up with this, not from you. You can't even cook breakfast right... without burning the fucking house down! You call this being solution-oriented? Oh, what? You really thought you'd get to Tendale on a ten-speed? All right. Okay. Kris printed these out. We should start handing them out at every stop of the way. Okay. Cool. Let the hunt begin, huh? "Bigfoot fact number six. Several accounts have attested to hearing unusual... high-pitched yelps upon alleged Bigfoot encounters. Other instances describe the phenomena as a human-like whistling sound." How is it a fact if the existence of Bigfoot isn't even a fact? Uh, "fact number seven. Communication by wood knocking may also serve as a navigational aid in nocturnal conditions." Tendale. Population: not many. September 13. My team and I reach Tendale three hours behind schedule. I fear Kris, our expedition transportation coordinator, vill discover the debt incurred on his credit card... after lengthy detour sidetracked us while he slept. We are looking into the barbershop, vere zee locals presumably get zer hair fashioned. Well, here we are, surrounded by plenty of nature, um, tourists, lumberjacks and possibly Bigfoot. Of course our mission is to... Find.. Morning, sleepyhead. You did some exploring as well, I see. Not a single motel. Or any food made in the last 20 years. Well, that should kill tourism. Why the hell did we agree to this? Something, something, bonding with your brother, something, something. And, uh, who said that? Couldn't tell you. The good ideas were just flying back and forth. Who knows what's what? Uh-huh. Kris! Ahh! Will! Hey, everybody, Will's here. Who are you talking to? Yeah, but that's not the point. I saw something. Oh. Brit, do you hear that? Will saw something. You're an ass. Unbelievable. Long trip. So, Bigfoot owns a bed-and-breakfast. Yeah, maybe. Oh-oh! Holy shit! Yeah, okay, that's live. That's what the sign said. Yeah. Thanks. Uh, rock-paper-scissors to see who goes under. I found another way through. Here we are. This shitty, asshole cabin. But that's cool. Wait a second. Oh, my God. Oh, that is awesome. Dude. Will. What are you doing? Yeah. Nothin'. Really? Yeah. Hey. Hi. Hi. Emma, this is my brother, Will. Will, this is Emma. She owns the bed-and-breakfast. What's up? Yeah. So, um, we're gonna get our stuff, if you're finished not doing whatever it is that you're doing. Yeah. No, that's.. that's perfect. Good. Thanks. Let's do that. Establish yourself as pervert. Check. Embarrass yourself in front of local hottie. Double check. Just a couple extra moments. Oh! Got everything? So, how long are you guys planning on staying? Um, probably just.. Uh, up in the air, actually. To the presidential suites! Oh. Hmm. You'll be sharing the top floor with Wyatt and Shanna. I hope you're not light sleepers. So I said, "Matthew, where did you get those Skittles from?" And he said, "I got.." Oh, Em, can we use the fire pit outside? Yeah. Of course. Okay. So, I said, "Matthew, where did you get those Skittles from? They're mine." And here we have the inside of our shitty, old cabin. Oh, wow. Oh, yeah, okay. All right. That's pretty serious. What else have we got here? What is that? There's a cot in the living room for your brother. We don't usually get more than a couple guests at a time, so I hope this will do. He's not too picky. He's barely house-trained, actually. Well, he'll fit right in with the locals then. Where's your bathroom? Uh, just past the stairs and first door on the right. Is she yours? What? Married, I mean. God. I'm sorry. We don't.. We just.. I haven't had this many guests in a while, so.. Guess I just like to know who's who. So you run this place on your own? No. No, not exactly. My Uncle Hank, he helps out from time to time, but... legally it's mine. That's a lot of responsibility. Yeah. Tell me about it. Nobody appreciates it either. Well, I do. Because if I had to spend another second in that car with my brother, I would have swerved into the opposite lane. Well, I'll let you get comfortable. Just, uh, call my name if you need anything. Okay. Good night. Kris? When you said it was up in the air, how long did you mean we were staying? Two, three days max. Good. 'Cause I know this was my idea and all, but we have a life to start starting. Well, why don't we get started right here? Give those Aussies a run for their money, eh, Mate? Outback's a dangerous place. Little buggers will sniff you out and eat you alive if you're not careful. And you kill these things with your bare hands? No, mate. This. Fuckers are vicious. I mean, they'll take your arm off like that. And these drop bears kill people all the time? Too fuckin' right. Shan, tell 'em about the one that 'tacked your gran. Took her leg off in one go. Trousers too. Huh. Wow. So what brings you guys out here? It's funny you ask that. What brings us out here, love? Bigfoot. Bigfoot, Mate. Bigfoot? Right. Bigfoot. Fuckin' Bigfoot, Mate! Uh, so, the Sasquatch Watch? No. Fuckin' Bigfoot. Met this old couple, ways back. They said, "Head to Tendale. That's where all the action is." Quite insistent, actually. Quite fucking insistent, actually. Don't... fuckin' move. Look at me. Now you're gonna run. In three, two, one. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Did I get you? I got him. I think I got him. How long were you back there? Yeah, Pete, how long were you back there? Come on. We gotta set sail before hittin' the trail. Oh, he's a poet, love. Expensive poet. Yeah, you're a fuckin' expensive poet. Truck's at the gate. I'll see you guys there in 10. Uh, Pete? It-It's Pete, right? Is this some sort of a Sasquatch Watch? Why are you here? Uh, we-we saw our parents on, um.. Well, there was a videotape that was shot here in Tendale.. Videotape? Well, yeah. It had our parents on it and.. Can I see that tape? Oh, why? You think it's.. You think it's worth something? I tell you what. I will trade you the videotape... if you take me on the Sasquatch Watch. Okay. Hand it over. Well, I don't have the tape on me right now. I'd have to ask my brother. You know, he-he's got.. Shit. I don't understand why the guy needs the tape so badly. Also worth noting, I'm sure he can take you out tomorrow. God knows there's nothing else going on in this town. I don't know either, Kris. I mean, that tape is the only evidence we have of our parents. Might give us some clues as to where they were last seen. And it's not in here either. We'll just get some sleep, and we'll look for it in the morning. It's probably in the car. The car. Yes! And knock next time! Jesus! Is he going to interrupt us again? Nope. It's a fuckin' sham, Wy. Bigfoot, right? Could be in Europe or somethin'. Is the concept of backpacking across foreign soil lost on you? When the country's this big, it is. Look, just enjoy the ride, Shan. You might not get to go Bigfoot hunting again. Oh! Fuck me. All right, all right. We are out of here. And, uh, Will the Conqueror? Next time maybe. Ah, so help you God, Kris, if you.. If you left it behind, I am.. What was that? That wasn't wind. Wind doesn't close doors, especially not when it's not blowing. Animal? No, that's definitely not an animal. That's, uh.. Imagination? Yeah. I could just sleep in here. No, no. I'm.. I'm gonna go out. And monsters. They open doors as easily as close them. Yeah, what the hell? You only live once, and chicks dig scars. Let's do this. Jesus, fuck! Everything okay? Do you need help getting back? Yeah. I think I, uh.. I just need some sleep. Okay. Wyatt, still think this was a good idea? Okay, you're right. Fucking Thailand for Christmas. Stick with me now. Payoff's comin'. I hope it's worth the trouble. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't. Did you remember to lock the doors? Maybe it was a bunch of schoolkids or something. The tape's gone and the battery's dead. So, now what? I would say you have... about a 1-in-30 chance of finding your parents. What makes you say that? There's only 60 people left in town. Oh. Right. The math works. Thank you. 900 hours. After suffering a slight delay, zee expedition continues as we search the few remaining inhabitants... for information as to the where abouts of our parents. We split into two groups: Kris and his fiancĂ© Brit, and me alone. Alone. Alone with Emma. Alone with Emma. So you make movies? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean.. No. No. No, I-I used to, uh, tool around when I was a kid. But then I found this camera after Baba died. Who's Baba? Uh, our foster mother. Kris and I. She had a stroke a couple weeks ago. You know, strokes are a natural part of life. Can't control them. Best not to try. At least it was fast. I'm so sorry. I had no idea. I'm.. Thanks. It's.. It's been hard. Was she, um.. Was she the only family you guys had? Or.. Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. Just me and Kris. And he is not.. Haven't been getting along lately? It's complicated, you know? I mean.. And-And now... him and Brit are moving to New York, and.. New York? That's.. Yeah. Wow. Well, I mean, come on. I'm big-time too. No, I don't doubt it. Yeah. I mean, I'm gonna.. I gonna be the guy who catches Bigfoot on tape. You just might. Yeah. Uh, anyway.. Thanks for the ride. And, um, I guess I'll see you later. All right. I'll See ya. Thanks. Pete, we're still okay. Hello. Uh, we are from.. Really, really friendly folks up here. Salt of the earth. Can I help you? Uh, yeah. Do you know when the tourism and information office opens? Yeah. About 10 years ago. Uhh. Um, then do you know anything about Thomas and Janet Oates? Need lots of answers, huh? Well, I need customers. What, this? If you could just do, like, my Amish neck beard. Of course. All types of tourists used to roll in and out of this town. I probably couldn't tell you even if I had met them. Head back. What makes you ask? They're my parents. Your parents? Well, I mean, biologically, yes. Me and my brother, Kris, we were raised by another woman. She's actually, uh, from these parts. Olivia Osenchuk? Some call her Baba. Would you look at that. Nope. Never heard of her. Turn to the left. Sure as the sun rises, there has never been anyone in this town by that name. Curtis! Strop! What's that figurine on the mantel? Wild Man. Superstition. Lots of that in Tendale. What kind of superstition? Well, some time ago, natives lived here. Taking from the land. Giving to the land. Small things. Animals, usually. Offerings, if you can believe it. Sacrifices. Yeah. They still do it? Natives? Nah. Well, why not? Don't have none. See, after the white folks settled, well, people started goin' missing. Children, mostly. They put a red mark on the door of every home that lost someone. Why'd they go missing? Well, you are Mr. Q & A, aren't you? Well, I guess I wouldn't put him up there... if I minded people talkin' about it. Wild Man took 'em. 'Course.. that's what the natives said. Then the Red Purge. The white man drove 'em out? They killed them. How's that? Yeah. 5.50, please, and thank you. Yeah. So what happened after the purge? Well, poof. Half the town taken by the Wild Man. Taken? Where were they taken? Do you really wanna go to all this trouble just for a wives' tale? Well, I mean.. Curtis. You mind finding our friend here a map? Thank you. Emma. Yeah. I'm lookin' at it right now. Left the car unlocked with the lights on. And the tape? Yeah, no, no. There's nothin' on the tape. No. Everything looks good. So they're free to go? Yeah. There's nothing on here. Just a few shots around town. That's it. They didn't see anything. How'd your thing go? Uh.. Bunch of slammed doors. Rude. Copy that. Hey. You guys ready to go back? Uh-uh. Actually... here, please. Pick up the gear, head into the woods and find Mom and Dad. Why would they be in the woods? 'Cause that's what the barber said. You sure you guys don't want me to come with you? No. That's okay. This is a family thing anyway. Uh, we'll meet here tomorrow. Uh, this exact spot. Yeah? Yeah. See you then. You guys ready yet? Yeah. What's gotten you so excited? I got a good feeling about this! 1800 hours. Vee continue our journey on foot. Za bugs are buzzing. Za birds, zey singing. Careful of the prickly bushes. Uh, no. I'm coming. Yeah, no. All right. Safe to say we're officially lost. Doesn't make any sense. The map says that we're.. It's not a map, Will. It's some doodle drawn by some backwoods morons. Why would they draw us a map to nowhere? Us and those Aussie horndogs are the only tourists they have. They need our business. Oh, our business. For what? There's no one here. This town's fucking dead. What about our parents? They dead too? This is a waste of time. Okay? All of this. What? You don't think I see what it is you're doing? Feeding Brit a sob story about how we need to do this? How we need to find our roots? Well, guess what, Will. Our roots don't exist. Our roots are long fucking gone. And Brit agrees with me. Kris, stop it. The only reason she agreed to do this is because she's a nice person... and she feels sorry for you. I do not feel sorry for you. I believe in you, and so does Kris. He's just.. Don't put words in my mouth. All right? You don't see it. You don't see what he is. Family. I'm your family. Ah. Well, maybe family is overrated. And there it is. Right? Kris, the patron saint of douche bag cocks around the fucking world. Go to hell, Will. Yeah. Save me a seat. Okay? You know what? I am sorry. I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you. I'm sorry that you have to move to the other side of the country... just to get some time to yourself. Yeah, well, you said it, not me. Do you ever think maybe I want you out of my life, that I'd be happy if you left? Well, great. Because I'm tired of keeping an eye... on my irresponsible, half-baked, older brother. I don't need you, Kris. I don't. Okay? Yeah, well, I'm tired of you weighing me down, Will. You think you're better than me? I think I'm trying harder at life, yeah. Yeah, and you're a friendless dickbag. How's that workin' out for you? Sorry. I can't hear you over your steroid-jacked body. Eat your own ass, you.. Enough! My God, the two of you are unbelievable. You're brothers. Brothers. And what's more than that, you're adults. Start treating each other as such, or I swear I'm gonna leave you on the side of this... Mountain. Adderall? What? Why are you carrying Adderall on our family camping trip? It's just something I.. Sometimes I, uh.. What, you think this is funny? I use it to focus, all right? You have no idea the kind of pressure that I'm under... because you never feel any of that. Pressure? No, no, not you, Honey. I swear, okay? It's never you. It's just.. It's my life. But I am your life. I'm a part of your life. And if you're keeping me separate than the other parts, I don't.. I-I-I don't need it, okay? It's not that bad. I swear. It.. It's just been hard lately. Okay? Look. Okay? Uh, you might not wanna do that. We are on the side of a mountain, and you.. Never mind. How long? How long have you been.. A while. A while. Well, uh.. Brit, will you just.. Good night, Will. Good night, Brit. Oh, that was liquid fire. Kris? Where'd you get that? It's, uh, Baba's relief.. relief.. relief bottle. Found it in a nightstand. So, uh, Adderall, huh? Drop it. Who's your dealer? Is it, uh, old crazy lady Vanderbuilt... across the street from Baba's? Yes. If it gets you to stop talking, then yes. That wrinkly old broad's got the best shit. I can't believe it. I think you just laughed a little bit. You must be hearing things. Is.. Is that it again? No. Must be hearing things. Kris. Kris, get up. Listen. It's getting closer. Go back to sleep. It's the same pattern. Three knocks. Every time. Where's Will? Will! Shit, shit, shit. Will! Will! What the hell's going on? You fucking crazy? Hey! I, uh.. I, uh.. I think you just grazed me. Guys. Fuck. Hey. Emma. Are you okay? Oh, shit. Grab on to me. You're gonna be okay, all right? Put pressure on the wound. Will, what the hell were you thinking? You can't just fire your fucking gun. Emma, look at me. I heard something. Grab my hand. Emma. Emma, look at me. I heard something. Will! He's in shock. Go get him. I'll take her to the car and drive her to the hospital. There's no hospital. He didn't just graze you, believe me. Will! Oh, shit. Will! Emma. Emma, don't do that. You got to stay awake for me, okay? We're gonna get you to a hospital, and they're gonna fix you up. Okay? You just got to stay awake. They won't.. They won't let.. Pete.. They won't what? Oh, thank God. A car. No, no, no, wait. They can help us. Don't. No. They'll get us to a hospital. Okay? There is no hospital. They'll take us to a town where there is a hospital. They'll kill me if I leave, and then they'll kill you. Believe me. Okay. Just give me your jacket. Don't talk. Don't say anything, okay? I'll talk. Okay. Okay, okay. Evenin', ladies. Everything all right? Yeah. We're just heading in for the night. Showing my guests here some trails. Uh-huh. Didn't happen to hear gunshots out there, did you? Was that.. Is that what that was? You sure you're okay, Em? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, thank you. I'm good. You're sittin' in the backseat just because? I, uh, think I.. I think I just had a few too many to drink. Responsible. Good girl. Well, how about you let me take you two back home? We're okay, Sir. Thanks any.. We just want you to get home safe. Oh, Kris, if you could see this. Will! Will! Will! Quite big. Quite a lot of fur. Definitely didn't hit him. Definitely didn't hit him. Ohh. What was I thinking? Will! Will! It was a Red Purge. They didn't stand a chance. Nobody.. Nobody turned on anybody. They couldn't get out even. Even if they tried, they just.. they didn't stand a chance. Will. The Wild Man. No! Let me go! Help! Help! Help! Hey, Pete. Um, I was thinkin'. You know that park ranger that works across the lake? Sorry. Can't we just use her and let the kids go? Yeah. You know what, Curtis? That's a great idea. Why don't we kill everyone that stumbles into Tendale? Huh? No, no. How about that driver that brings in the groceries? Or, you know, what about that nice, little family... that bakes those cookies for the coffee shop? Huh? Think before you talk. The Bigfoot book says that sometimes they whistle... and sometimes they, uh.. they like to knock on wood. Shut up, Will. No. Seriously, I'm just.. I'm just sayin', okay? You just gonna listen. You gonna stop. You gotta listen.. This is Emma's radio. Hello? Hello? Curtis, what the hell did I say about you playin' on that goddamn radio? It's not me. We'll go ahead anyway. We're startin'. You may wanna get inside. Here we go. Shan! Shan? No. No. No! Brit. Well, then where is she, Will? You all right? You seem a little.. I'm fine. You sure? 'Cause.. I said I'm fucking fine. Okay? I got this. We go to the B & B, we grab our shit, we grab Brit, and then we get the fuck out of here. Let me go. I haven't walked a foot near that red line. Not many people have. You need a green ticket. Of course... some, they send their kids. And if they're good, they will grow up... and they will send more people like you... for more people like us. Don't you understand? Fuck... you. The Gods are gonna love you. No. Please! No! Help me! What part of "Keep an eye on them" don't you understand? You know there's a process to this. They weren't sent by anybody, so they get out. As usual. But I do.. You wanted out. I know. It's all right. You wanted out, and you thought those kids were your opportunity. But there are no opportunities left. Not for you. Are you stoned? They're not gonna leave here without the girl. We have to kill them. If we do, more people will come looking for them. You said so yourself. But if we let them go, they'll bring this whole thing crashing down on us. We're fucked. You're the one who started this mess. You drew 'em a fucking map. I thought they were sent to us. Christ. Hey. If we're screwed either way, then it doesn't matter if they live or die. We can let 'em go and do the right thing. What exactly is the right thing, Curtis? Uncle Hank, I'm.. Shut up. Shut up and let me fuckin' think! The Aussie. The girl. And now the two brothers. That's four tickets out of Tendale. Now, we have sacrificed enough for this town. I want my ticket. What about the Aussie girl? The one you let go? You watch that fuckin' mouth of yours. She's as good as dead in those woods... as much as she is strapped to that post. Now, those boys are going to the Gods, and that is all there is to it. What if they're halfway to the next town talkin' to the police? Brit! Brit! You upstairs? Hey. Hey. Is she gonna be okay? She's not upstairs. Where's my girlfriend? She just went to get some help at the next town. Right. That's why our car's outside. Will, start the car. I'm searching your house. Help him with the car. You kill him, that's your ticket on the line. Brit! Brit! What are you tryin' to do here? I'll need a boost from your truck. I don't think that'll do it, but okay. That was worth a try. Yeah, here. Let me fix you a drink. We'll call for a tow in the morning. Brit. What the hell? It's worth a shot, right? I don't think you wanna be doing that now, or you'll.. Oh, fuck. No! Kris, I killed Hank. We gotta go. Outside. Oh, I'm so sorry. First you, now him. Outside. What outside? Emma, you lost a lot of blood. You're not thinking clearly. I need you to concentrate. Where's Kris? They're gonna kill her. They're gonna kill her. Who's gonna kill her? Emma, what is it? Whoa. Whoa. Easy there, partner. What are you doing with him? Just take it easy. All right? We can talk about this. Put him down. Look, you just may shoot your brother there if you're not careful. Now, it looks like we had an accident already. Huh? We don't want another one, now, do we? So... put the gun down. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Please wake up. Please. That's enough. Fuck you, motherfucker. Would you just let him come to his senses on his own? What the fuck is this? This here's a transaction and you are the currency. And your brother over here decided to join the party. He tried to save us. And how'd he do? It just.. It slipped and I.. Hank, we're good to go. Hank. Well, at least we know where Brit is. Okay. Don't look. But I think they're recording us. I found tapes in the basement of everything. If we can somehow get out of here, we'll have everything we need to expose this town. And how do you plan on doing that? So here's what's gonna happen. I play the tape, they come, you die, I leave. How's that sound? What the hell are you doing? I'm playing dead. Maybe they'll just pass right over me. 911. Please state the nature of your emergency. 911. Please state the nature of your emergency. Guys. Hello? I was born on May 23... I think I have a way we can get out of here. to Russ and Christine Nielson. Ma'am, you need to tell me where you are so I can send help. Are you there? Easy. Ma'am? I shouldn't have kicked you in your head that year at summer camp. Helped kill dozens of people. I'm sorry I said I wished I was a single child. What town, Ma'am? Uh-huh. Just please stop swaying. Keep 'em coming. We need your location to send help. Emma! But not anymore. You were always better at baseball than me. Well, not at first, but.. Just save the apologies. Grab the next fucking chain. Now you get to watch them die. No. No! Will! Car's dead. Start the truck. Car's dead. Start the truck. Don't I get a bad-guy speech? What? I'll meet you at the car. Where are you going? The tapes. Hey! Keep that in mind when you pick out my wedding ring. It was in the car. Get her to the truck. Got her? I gotta get the tapes. Leave the tapes, Will. All right. You wanted a bad-guy speech. You think I'm the bad guy? All the Gods do is take. That is all they have ever done. Take, take, take. What about me? This town would be dead without me! I pay for the sins of our fathers, and when the Gods are hungry, I feed them! Will! Easy, Will. Turn and walk away. Just turn and walk towards the truck, Will. Stop it, Will. Come towards the truck. We need them! For fuck's sake, Will, get in the goddamn truck! They'll kill us anyway! Think about the rest of us. I am. I am simply not afraid. It is not in my dictionary of behavior. Go home! Start a family! Baba, I'm gonna see you soon. Will, stop! No! No! We have to go. Let's go. Come and get it, motherfucker! You ain't so fast. Look, I'm.. I'm sorry to tell you this, but, uh, your lady friend who was shot didn't make it. But she did manage to call 911. I've got a whole unit up there right now surveying the scene. But I have to ask you, why were you filming all this? They were. Not us. In the basement. Tapes. Hundreds of them. Sacrifices. Sacrifices? We'll get a VCR. We'll have a look at this stuff and see what's what. But that takes time. In the meantime, I need you to answer some more questions. Shit. Maggie, come on, Girl. Unfortunately, my men haven't seen anything. And we need to talk about some other salient facts here. What salient facts? You were caught in a stolen car. And the story that goes with it.. pff.. smells worse than you look. What about the skull we found? Oh. You mean this skull? Seen better hoaxes than that, Miss. Now, this better not be some kind of a stunt, Young Lady, or else all of you are in serious trouble. Because we don't respond to that kind of thing very well. Especially since I sent my best men up there to comb the area. Make sure... they don't stay... long. Maggie. Where are you, girl? They're smart. Okay? They can communicate. They probably covered their tracks. They could have taken all the evidence. Of course. They knew people were coming. There's gonna be no one left in that town. You think I'm making this up? Hey, Bill. Pack up and come back, would you? I got a friend here with a story you might enjoy. What is that? Go back. Now, the first thing you two are gonna do is call a lawyer. Yeah, go ahead, Bill. Help! Help! Bill? Help! Bill, what's goin' on? Send help.
