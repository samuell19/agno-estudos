I'M ONLY GOING TO TELL YOU THIS ONCE, SO LISTEN CAREFULLY. YES--YES, OF COURSE. MANY YEARS AGO, AFTER BEING BANISHED FOR DEVELOPING THE FORBIDDEN ARTS, ROTHBART CAME TO THE CASTLE AT SWAN LAKE. VANQUISHED AND POWERLESS, HE LIVED IN DESPAIR UNTIL I FOUND HIM. I ROUSED HIS SPIRIT AND INSPIRED HIM TO BEGIN ANEW. I AWAKENED THE SLEEPING EVIL GENIUS WITHIN. AND AFTER YEARS OF WORK, THE FRUIT OF OUR LABOR FINALLY APPEARED. (Rothbart) ORLA BAY... DU ANNA BE LAY. CONDORA... ILLUSTRY CRUXSIS. [gasps] [whooshing] FINALLY. THE FORBIDDEN ARTS ARE MINE AGAIN. NOW WE WILL RULE AS KING AND QUEEN. ACTUALLY, I HAD A DIFFERENT PLAN. I'M GONNA FORCE ODETTE TO MARRY ME. OF COURSE, IT CUTS YOU OUT OF THE PLAN. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE FORBIDDEN ARTS, IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME. TRUE. AND YET, SADLY, YOU'RE OUT OF HERE. THOSE NOTES BELONG TO ME JUST AS MUCH AS THEY BELONG TO YOU. MORE! AND THEY WILL BE MINE SOMEDAY. THEY WILL BE MINE! GET OUT. [crackling] I HAVE A FEELING THOSE NOTES STILL EXIST. AND YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME GET THEM. BUT--M-M-M-- EXCUSE ME, BUT MAY I JUST MENTION THAT I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO TALENT FOR THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF VENTURE? WHATSOEVER. ON THE CONTRARY. "THE YAKIBIRD CAN IMITATE ANY VOICE AFTER HEARING IT ONLY ONCE." DO MINE. BUT I--I DON'T THINK-- DO MY VOICE! [imitating] DO MY VOICE! DO IT AGAIN! DO IT AGAIN! DO IT AGAIN! DO IT AGAIN! GO TO THE CASTLE AT SWAN LAKE AND FIND OUT IF THOSE NOTES STILL EXIST, MY LITTLE SPY. SPY? NO, SEE, SPIES GET CAPTURED AND T-TORTURED. I COULDN'T BEAR TORTURE. I--I START SOBBING IF I EVEN GET A CANKER SORE. [chattering] OH, STOP WHINING. AS SOON AS YOU FIND OUT IF THE NOTES EXIST, I PROMISE TO SET YOU FREE. SEEK OUT WHIZZER AND BRING HIM TO ME! [squeaking] MY LITTLE SEEKERS ARE A FAR CRY FROM THE FORBIDDEN ARTS. BUT THEY CAN FIND YOU, NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO. SO DON'T EVER TRY TO RUN. AND DON'T YOU EVER BETRAY ME! NOW GO FIND OUT ABOUT THOSE NOTES! [Zelda cackling] [with French accent] 47, 48, 49, 50. [grunting] LOOK. LOOK. YOU MEAN THOSE LITTLE BUMPS? THESE LITTLE BUMPS ARE GOING TO HELP ME WIN THE OBSTACLE COURSE. YOU'RE GONNA ENTER THE OBSTACLE COURSE? THAT'S RIGHT, MR. INCH-AT-A-TIME. AND WHEN I AM CROWNED PRINCE FOR A DAY, FINALLY THE PEOPLE WILL SEE ME AS A PRINCE FOREVER. [laughing] [laughing] IF YOU DON'T MIND, IT'S TIME TO WORK ON MY MENTAL FITNESS. OH, YOU COULD SAY THAT AGAIN. THE NEXT ONE WHO DISTURBS ME SHALL BE PUNISHED BY THESE BABIES. WHOO, RUN AWAY. RUN AWAY. [Puffin laughing] JEAN-BOB, YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ROTHBART'S NOTES BEING HIDDEN IN THE CASTLE? OK, THAT'S IT. [choking] [screaming] EVERY DAY, IN EVERY WAY, I JUST GET BETTER AND BETTER. NO? [chuckles] IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME, OF COURSE. BUT SOME PEOPLE THINK THE OBSTACLE COURSE IS TOO D-DANGEROUS. MMM-HMM. MMM. ARE ROTHBART'S NOTES ON THE FORBIDDEN ARTS REALLY HIDDEN IN THE CASTLE? WHO TOLD YOU THAT? OH, WELL, E-EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT IT. DEREK, OH, DEREK, SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAS HAPPENED. YOU CAN TELL ME IN FRONT OF ODETTE. I--I--I-- I'M NOT SURE. ROGERS, WE HAVE NO SECRETS. ACTUALLY, YOU, UM, YOU--YOU DO HAVE THAT ONE SECRET. GO ON, ROGERS. YEAH, GO ON. WELL, THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND ABOUT ROTHBART'S NOTES. THAT THEY'RE BEING HIDDEN IN THE CASTLE. OH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS. IF WE KNEW THOSE NOTES EXISTED, THEY'D BE DESTROYED IMMEDIATELY. ACTUALLY, ODETTE, UM... YOU FOUND ROTHBART'S FORMULA FOR THE FORBIDDEN ARTS AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME? I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO WORRY. YOU SEE, AFTER CLAVIUS AND THE ORB WERE DESTROYED, ROGERS AND I FOUND THIS UNDERGROUND CHAMBER. THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF THINGS ROTHBART LEFT BEHIND. INCLUDING HIS FORMULA FOR THE FORBIDDEN ARTS. [water dripping] WE DESTROYED EVERYTHING, OF COURSE. EXCEPT ROTHBART'S NOTES. I'M FREE. DEREK, HOW COULD YOU? APOLOGIZE, DEREK. I REALLY THINK THAT SOMEDAY WE CAN USE THEIR POWER FOR GOOD. DEREK, NOTHING GOOD CAN COME FROM THOSE NOTES. YOU MUST DESTROY THEM. YOU'RE RIGHT, ODETTE. I'LL DESTROY THEM RIGHT AWAY. ROGERS AND I ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. BUT THERE'S A RUMOR. LOOK, EVEN IF SOMEONE DID FIND THEM, THEY'D NEVER FIGURE THEM OUT WITHOUT MY HELP. APOLOGIZE, APOLOGIZE, APOLOGIZE. I WOULD NEVER PUT YOU IN DANGER. PROMISE ME YOU'LL DESTROY THOSE NOTES, DEREK. I PROMISE. I WAS CARELESS, FOOLISH, AND SELFISH. BUT I WASN'T. I DID THIS FOR US. FOR THE KINGDOM. PLEASE, JUST TRUST ME, ODETTE. PLEASE, ROGERS, NO LONG SPEECHES. I ONLY NEED 2 WORDS: NUMB SKULL. HA-HA! I'M HOME FREE. PHEW! NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GET OUT OF HERE. HUH? HOLD IT. SPYING IS A CRIME IN THIS KINGDOM. SO I HEREBY CLAIM YOU AS A PRISONER OF WAR. [squawking] [groaning] MOMMY, WILL YOU HOLD ME? [panting] [squeaking] OH! [chattering] [shrieking] [groaning] [coughing] GO GET A SMOG CHECK, WHY DON'T YOU? [gulps and spits] [gags] [laughing] WELL, I'M LOCKED ON YOU, SMALL FRY. YOU'LL GIVE UP, OR ELSE... [yelling] [panting] PHEW! ZELDA, ZELDA, THE NOTES ARE THERE! I KNEW THEY WERE THERE. I KNEW IT! GREAT, THE NOTES ARE THERE. MEANWHILE, I GOT AN ULCER THE SIZE OF A WATERMELON. NOW, TO GET MY HANDS ON THAT CHEST. WELL, AT LEAST IT'S DONE AND I CAN GO BACK TO MY REGULAR, CALM LIFE. ALTHOUGH I'M PROBABLY GONNA HAVE NIGHTMARES THE REST OF MY LIFE FROM THIS LITTLE MASQUERADE. [gasps] MASQUERADE. SO LONG, ZELDA. I'M LEAVING. I THINK I DO A LITTLE PLAY-ACTING. I WILL PLAY MAIDEN IN DISTRESS FROM THE FARAWAY NORTH. BREAK A LEG. OH, AND THE NEXT TIME YOU NEED A TALKING BIRD, I UNDERSTAND PARROTS ARE VERY DEPENDABLE. NOT SO FAST. THERE'S A PART FOR YOU, TOO, IN MY LITTLE CHARADE. YOU PROMISED TO SET ME FREE. HOW CAN I BE A MAIDEN IN DISTRESS WITHOUT ANYONE TO DISTRESS ME? WE MADE A DEAL. NOW I'M MAKING YOU ANOTHER DEAL. THAT'S 2 DEALS IN ONE DAY. HOW MANY DEALS DO YOU WANT? ZOUNDS, BOY, SHOW SOME GRATITUDE. [gulps] GOOD THING I CHECKED THIS. THIS CABLE IS COMING LOOSE. YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT THAT WAY. ADDS A LITTLE DANGER AND EXCITEMENT TO A RATHER EASY AND BORING RIDE. [grunting] DEREK! WE NEED TO TALK. ROGERS, OLD MAN. YOU MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP. YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM WITH THAT "OLD MAN" STUFF. AS YOUR COUNSELOR AND FRIEND, DEREK, I BEG YOU. APOLOGIZE TO ODETTE. YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO, SOONER OR LATER. WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO APOLOGIZE? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE HUSBANDS DO. WE HUNT, WE FISH, WE WATCH SPORTING EVENTS AND WE APOLOGIZE! I COULD NEVER BE MARRIED AND GIVE UP MY DAYS OF LIVING ON THE EDGE. EXCUSE ME, BIG SILLY BRAGGART, BUT I WAS TALKING TO DEREK. YOU KNOW SHE'S RIGHT. SHE'S ALWAYS RIGHT. NOW YOU'RE ON HER SIDE? YOU KEPT THE SECRET, TOO, YOU KNOW. I NEVER FELT GOOD ABOUT IT. WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING, THEN. YOU'RE THE PRINCE! YOU'RE MY COUNSELOR. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO COUNSEL ME. WELL, I'M SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT YOU. THAT'S MY POINT. [gasps] HE GOT YOU ON THAT ONE. YOU'VE BEEN DISGRACED, OLD MAN. AND YET, I LEAVE IN TRIUMPH. PLEASE, DEREK. RECONSIDER! RECONSIDER WHAT? I'M RIGHT, AREN'T I? ¶ ISN'T IT ENOUGH THAT I FIGHT THE DRAGONS? ¶ THAT I FIGHT THE VILLAINS AND I WIN THE PRIZE? ¶ ISN'T IT ENOUGH THAT I RUN THE KINGDOM? ¶ SOLVE EVERYONE'S PROBLEMS, DIRECT AND ADVISE? ¶ WHY MUST I ALSO GET DOWN ON MY KNEES ¶ AND APOLOGIZE? ¶ BECAUSE I LOVE HER, I NEED HER ¶ LIKE EARTH NEEDS THE SUN ¶ I NEED THE ONE I LOVE ¶ TO KEEP MY HOPE BRIGHT, MY HEAD RIGHT ¶ MY HEART FIGHTING ON ¶ UNTIL I AM BACK IN HER ARMS ¶ BECAUSE I LOVE HER, I NEED HER ¶ LIKE SUMMER NEEDS RAIN ¶ TO GROW AND SUSTAIN EACH DAY ¶ I HEAR HER SINGING ¶ AND BRINGING HER STRENGTH TO MY SOUL ¶ UNTIL I AM BACK ¶ IN HER ARMS ¶ MILES APART, YET STILL MY HEART ¶ CAN HEAR HER MELODY ¶ I'M MORE THAN SURE THAT I CAN'T ENDURE ¶ WITHOUT HER LOVE FOR ME ¶ BECAUSE I LOVE HER AND NEED HER ¶ LIKE I NEED TO BREATHE ¶ DID ADAM NEED EVE LIKE THIS? ¶ NOW I SEE CLEARLY ¶ I NEARLY GAVE UP ALL I HAD ¶ SO WHATEVER OUR DIFFERENCES WERE ¶ I'LL BID THEM GOODBYE ¶ I'LL GIVE LOVE A TRY ¶ AND ALL BECAUSE ¶ I LOVE HER! ¶ ALMOST. LOOK AT ALL THESE ENTRIES, PUFFIN. OH, I CAN'T RIGHT NOW, PRINCESS. ME RADAR IS-- POTOO-POTOO-POTOO-- SEARCHING FOR ENEMY ACTIVITY. FREDERICK, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU LIKED TO PERFORM. WHAT WILL YOU DO?

ROGERS, YOU WILL HELP ME WIN THIS TALENT SHOW. OH, NO, MA'AM. A WALTZ MAYBE, A NICE FOX TROT. BUT THE TANGO. NO SIRREE, ROBERT. OH! YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. HOW SILLY OF ME TO THINK THAT YOU COULD STILL DO THE TANGO. WELL, I DIDN'T SAY I COULDN'T DO IT. [crying] I GUESS EVEN THE GREATEST DANCERS MUST GROW OLD AND STIFF. I'M NOT THAT OLD. NO, NO, NO, PLEASE, PLEASE. DON'T FIGHT IT, ROGERS. YOU MUST ACCEPT THE TRUTH. YOUR MUSCLES HAVE BECOME WEAK AND FLABBY. YOU'VE THE TIMING OF A BUSTED CLOCK. NOW WAIT A MINUTE. POOR ROGERS.

NOTHING WILL HAPPEN. AND SO I TELL THE KING: "I WILL NOT PLAY ACCORDION NO MORE." YES, AND SO THEN WHAT DID HE DO? WHAT DID THAT AWFUL KING DO? THE KING, HE GRAB ME AND SAY: "YOU MUST PLAY ACCORDION." AND ZELDA SAY, "I WON'T!" THEN THE KING, HE SHAKE ME AND SAY: "YOU MUST!" AND THEN ZELDA SAY, "NO." [gagging] THEN THE KING YELL, "GUARD!"
