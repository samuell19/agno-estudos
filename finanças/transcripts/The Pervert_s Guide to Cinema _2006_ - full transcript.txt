Cinema, as the art of appearances, tells us something about reality itself. It tells us something about how reality constitutes itself. Not that way! Ripley. Ripley, come on. Ripley, we've got no time for sightseeing here. Ripley, don't. There is an old Gnostic theory that our world was not perfectly created, that the god who created our world was an idiot who bungled the job, so that our world is a half-finished creation. There are voids, openings, gaps. It's not fully real, fully constituted. In the wonderful scene in the last instalment of the Alien saga, Alien Resurrection, when Ripley, the cloned Ripley, enters a mysterious room, she encounters the previous failed version of herself, of cloning herself. Just a horrified creature, a small foetus-like entity, then more developed forms. Finally, a creature which almost looks like her, but her limbs are like that of the monster. Kill me. This means that all the time our previous alternate embodiments, what we might have been but are not, that these alternate versions of ourselves are haunting us. That's the ontological view of reality that we get here, as if it's an unfinished universe. This is, I think, a very modern feeling. It is through such ontology of unfinished reality that cinema became a truly modern art. All modern films are ultimately films about the possibility or impossibility to make a film. This is the sad tale of the township of Dogville. Dogville was in the Rocky Mountains in the US of A, up here where the road came to its definitive end near the entrance to the old, abandoned silver mine. The residents of Dogville were good, honest folks and they liked their township. With Von Trier, it's not only the problem of belief in the sense of, do people generally still believe today the place of religion today, and so on. It's also reflectively or allegorically the question of believing in cinema itself. How to make today people still believe in the magic of cinema? In Dogville, all of it is staged on a set. Okay, this is often the case in cinema, but here the set is seen as the set. The action takes place in Dogville, a small town, but there are no houses. There are just lines on the floor, signalling that this is the house, this is the street. The mysterious thing is that this does not prevent our identification. If anything, it makes us even more thrown into the tensions of the inner life. Have you seen Grace? She's at my place. - Is she busy? - Not any more. Go right in. It's not that naive belief is undermined, deconstructed through irony. Von Trier wants to be serious with the magic. Irony is put into service to make us believe. Yet again, Grace had made a miraculous escape from her pursuers with the aid of the people of Dogville. Everyone had covered up for her, including Chuck, who had to admit that it was probably Tom's hat he'd mistakenly considered so suspicious. The mystery is that even if we know that it's only staged, that it's a fiction, it still fascinates us. That's the fundamental magic of it. You witness a certain seductive scene, then you are shown that it's just a fake, stage machinery behind, but you are still fascinated by it. Illusion persists. There is something real in the illusion, more real than in the reality behind it. Do not arouse the wrath of the great and powerful Oz! I said come back tomorrow! If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises. Do you presume to criticize the great Oz? You ungrateful creatures! Think yourselves lucky that I'm giving you audience tomorrow instead of 20 years from now! The great Oz has spoken. Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain. The great and... Oz has spoken. - Who are you? - Well, I... I am the great and powerful Wizard of Oz. What we can learn from a film like Wizard of Oz is how the logic of de-mystification is not enough. It's not enough to say, "Okay, it's just a big show spectacle to impress the people. "What is behind is just a modest old guy," and so on and so on. It is that rather, in a way, there is more truth in this appearance. Appearance has an effectivity, a truth of its own. What about the heart that you promised Tin Man? Well... And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion? - And Scarecrow's brain? - And Scarecrow's brain? Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity. Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth or slinks through slimy seas has a brain. Back where I come from, we have universities, seats of great learning where men go to become great thinkers. And when they come out, they think deep thoughts and with no more brains than you have. But they have one thing you haven't got. A diploma! Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D. - Th.D.? - That's Doctor of Thinkology. The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side. Oh, joy, rapture! I've got a brain! And that's the paradox of cinema, the paradox of belief. We don't simply believe or do not believe. We always believe in a kind of a conditional mode. I know very well it's a fake but, nonetheless, I let myself be emotionally affected. How do you do? Mr. Carl Laemmle feels it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning. We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein, a man of science, who sought to create a man after his own image without reckoning upon God. Somebody tells us you have to experience horror, we do it. So if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now is your chance to... Well, we've warned you. Ladies and gentlemen, young and old, this may seem an unusual procedure, speaking to you before the picture begins. But we have an unusual subject. Behind, not red, this is Hollywood, but black curtain, Cecil DeMille himself appears, giving us a lesson of how the story of ten commandments and Moses has great relevance today where we are fighting communist, totalitarian danger and so on, giving us all the clues. Are men the property of the state? Or are they free souls under God? This same battle continues throughout the world today. This hidden master who controls the events can also be defined as ideology embodied, in the sense of the space which organizes our desires. And your name? What the fuck is your name? In David Lynch's Lost Highway, we have the Mystery Man, who stands for the very cinematographer, even director. Imagine somebody who has a direct access to your inner life, to your innermost fantasies, to what even you don't want to know about yourself. We've met before, haven't we? I don't think so. Where was it that you think we met? At your house, don't you remember? The best way to imagine what Mystery Man is, is to imagine somebody who doesn't want anything from us. What do you mean? You're where right now? At your house. That's fucking crazy, man. Call me. That's the true horror of this Mystery Man. Not any evil, demoniac intentions and so on. Just the fact that when he is in front of you, he, as it were, sees through you. I told you I was here. How'd you do that? Ask me. - How'd you get inside my house? - You invited me. It is not my custom to go where I'm not wanted. It's like the court in Kafka's novels, where the court, or the Law, only comes when you ask for it. Oh! Now, why would he do that? Most peculiar. What on Earth? Hitchcock was obsessed with this topic of manipulating emotions. His dream was even that once in the future, we would no longer have to shoot narratives, our brains will be directly connected to some machine and the director would only have to press different buttons there and the appropriate emotions will be awakened in our mind. They're coming. They're coming! What have directors like Hitchcock, Tarkovsky, Kieslowski, Lynch have in common? A certain autonomy of cinematic form. Form is not here simply to express, articulate content. It has a message of its own. In Hitchcock, we have the motif of a person hanging from an abyss by the hand of another person. The first example, Saboteur. Rear Window. Then we have in To Catch a Thief. You've got a full house down there. Begin the performance. Then in North by Northwest. Then, of course, in Vertigo. So we see here the same visual motif repeating itself. I think it's wrong to look for a common, deeper meaning. Some French theorists claimed that what we are dealing here with is the motif of fall and redemption. I think this is already saying too much. I think that what we are dealing with is with a kind of a cinematic materialism, that beneath the level of meaning, spiritual meaning but also simple narrative meaning, we get a more elementary level of forms themselves, communicating with each other, interacting, reverberating, echoing, morphing, transforming one into the other. And it is this background, this background of proto-reality, a real which is more dense, more fundamental than the narrative reality, the story that we observe. It is this that provides the proper density of the cinematic experience. It's the gigantic tree where, in Vertigo, Madeleine and Scottie get together, almost embrace, where their erotic tension becomes unbearable. What is this tree? I think it's another in the series of "Hitchcockian Big Things," like the Mount Rushmore statues, or take another example, like Moby-Dick. This tree is not simply a natural object. It is, within our mental space, what in psychoanalysis is called "the Thing". It's effectively as if this tree, in its very extra-large distortion, embodies something that comes out of our inner space, libido, the excessive energy of our mind. So here I think we can see how films and philosophy are coming together. How great cinematographers really enable us to think in visual terms. After the birds attack the city, there is a fire which breaks out at a gasoline station, where a guy throws a match on the gasoline. Hey, you! Look out! Don't drop that match! Look out! Get out of there! - Mister, run! - Watch out! The first part of this short scene is the standard one. We get the standard exchange of shots of the fire and shots of the person, Melanie in this case, who looks at it. Then something strange happens. We cut to way above the city. We see the entire town. We automatically take this shot as a standard establishing shot. Like after details which perplex you, which prevent you from getting a clear orientation, you need a shot which enables you some kind of a cognitive mapping, that you know what's going on. But then, precisely following that logic of the Thing from inner space which emerges from within you, first we hear these ominous sounds, which are sounds of the birds, then one bird enters, another bird enters... The shot which was taken as a neutral, God's view shot, all of a sudden changes into an evil gaze. The gaze of the very birds attacking. And we are thrown into that position. And again, we can use here The Birds as the final instalment and read backwards other classical Hitchcock scenes in the same way. Isn't exactly the same thing happening in what I consider the ultimate scene in Psycho, the second murder, the murder of the detective Arbogast? Hitchcock manipulates here in a very refined way the logic of so-called fetishist disavowal. The logic of, "I know very well, but..." We know very well some things, but we don't really believe in them, so although we know they will happen, we are no less surprized when they happen. In this case, everything points towards the murder and, nonetheless, when it happens, the surprize is, if anything, stronger. It begins in a standard Hitchcockian way. He looks up the stairs. This exchange creates the Hitchcockian tension between the subject's look and the stairs themselves, or rather the void on the top of the stairs returning the gaze, emanating some kind of a weird unfathomable threat. The camera then provides a kind of a geometrically clear God's point of view shot image of the entire scene. It is as if here we pass from God as neutral creator, to God in his unbearable divine rage. This murderer is for us an unfathomable monster. We don't know who he is, but because we are forced to assume the murderer's position, in a way we don't know who we are. As if we discover a terrifying dimension in ourselves. As if we are forced to act as a doll, as a tool of another evil divinity's will. [baby cries] It's not as classical metaphysics thinks, "We are too terrified to accept the fact that we are mortal beings, "we would like to be immortal." No. The truly horrible thing is to be immortal. Immortality is the true nightmare, not death. Lord Vader, can you hear me? We should remember the exact moment when the normal, everyday person, okay not quite everyday, but ordinary person of Anakin Skywalker changes into Darth Vader. This scene when the Emperor's doctors are reconstituting him after heavy wounds into Darth Vader, that these scenes are inter-cut with the scenes of Princess Padmé, Anakin's wife, giving birth. Luke. So it is as if we are witnessing the transformation of Anakin into father. But what kind of father? A monster of a father who doesn't want to be dead. His deep breathing is the sound of the father, the Freudian, primordial father, this obscene over-potent father, the father who doesn't want to die. This, I think, is for all of us the most obscene threat that we witness. We don't want our fathers alive. We want them dead. The ultimate object of anxiety is a living father. This brings us to what we should really be attentive about in David Lynch's film. Namely, what is to be taken seriously and not seriously in his films. - We love Ben. - We love Ben. - Here's to Ben. - Here's to Ben. Here's to Ben. - Here's to Ben. - Be polite! Here's to Ben. Frank is one of these terrifying, ridiculously obscene paternal figures. Apart from Frank in Blue Velvet, we have Baron Harkonnen in Dune, we have Willem Dafoe in Wild at Heart, we have Mr. Eddy in Lost Highway. Don't you ever fucking tailgate! Ever! - Tell him you won't tailgate. - Ever! I won't ever tailgate... Do you know how many fucking car lengths it takes to stop a car at 35 miles an hour? Six fucking car lengths! That's 106 fucking feet, mister! If I had to stop suddenly, you would have hit me! I want you to get a fucking driver's manual and I want you to study that motherfucker! I want to spit once on your head. Just some spittle in your face. What a luxury. But I think that this very appearance of ridiculously violent comedy is deceiving. I think that these ridiculous paternal figures are the ethical focus, the topic of practically all David Lynch's films. Let's fuck! I'll fuck anything that moves! A normal, paternal authority is an ordinary man who, as it were, wears phallus as an insignia. He has something which provides his symbolic authority. This is, in psychoanalytic theory, phallus. You are not phallus. You possess phallus. Phallus is something attached to you, like the King's crown is his phallus. Something you put on and this gives you authority. So that when you talk it's not simply you as a common person who is talking, it's symbolic authority itself, the Law, the state, talking through you. So these excessively ridiculous paternal figures, it's not simply that they possess phallus, that they have phallus as the insignia of their authority, in a way, they immediately are phallus. This is for, if they still exist, a normal male subject... This is the most terrorising experience you can imagine, to directly being the thing itself, to assume that I am a phallus. And the provocative greatness of these Lynchian, obscene, paternal figures, is that not only they don't have any anxiety, not only they are not afraid of it, they fully enjoy being it. They are truly fearless entities beyond life and death, gladly assuming, as it were, their immortality, their non-castrated life energy. Okay. This is indicated in a very nice way in the scene towards the end of Wild at Heart where Bobby Peru is killed. Stop, you sons of bitches! This is the police! He accepts the mortal danger he is in with, kind of, exuberant vitality, and it's truly that when his head explodes, it's as if we see the head of the penis being torn apart. Oh, for Christ sakes. That poor bastard. And then at the end, these figures are sacrificed. Oh, Jeffrey. It's all over, Jeffrey. [Russian women singing] ♪♪ [Russian men sing] ♪♪ Joseph Stalin's favorite cinematic genre were musicals. Not only Hollywood musicals, but also Soviet musicals. There was a whole series of so-called 'Kolkhoz musicals.' Why? We should find this strange, Stalin who personifies communist austerity, terror and musicals. The answer again is the psychoanalytic notion of superego. Superego is not only excessive terror, unconditional injunction, demand of utter sacrifice, but at the same time, obscenity, laughter. And it is Sergei Eisenstein's genius to guess at this link. In his last film, which is a coded portrait of the Stalin era, Ivan the Terrible: Part 2, which because of all this was immediately prohibited. In the unique scene towards the end of the film, we see the Czar, Ivan, throwing a party, amusing himself, with his so-called Oprichniki, his private guards, who were used to torture and kill his enemies, his, if you want, KGB, secret police, are seen performing a musical. An obscene musical, which tells precisely the story about killing the rich boyars, Ivan's main enemies. Let the axes drop! ♪ So terror itself is staged as a musical. And the gates fell to the ground ♪ Now, what has all this to do with the reality of political terror? Isn't this just art, imagination? No. Not only were the political show trials in Moscow in the mid- and late-1930s theatrical performances, we should not forget this, they were well staged, rehearsed and so on. Even more, there is, horrible as it may sound, something comical about them. The horror was so ruthless that the victims, those who had to confess and demand death penalty for themselves and so on, were deprived of the minimum of their dignity, so that they behaved as puppets, they engaged in dialogues which really sound like out of Alice in Wonderland. They behaved as persons from a cartoon. Public enemy number one. You're on trial today for the crimes that you've committed. We're gonna prove you're guilty. Just try and get acquitted. In the mid-'30s, Walt Disney Studios produced an unbelievable cartoon called Pluto's Judgement Day... Shut up! ...in which the dog, well-known Pluto, falls asleep, and in his sleep is persecuted by, haunted by the dream of cats who were all in the past his victims, molested by him, dragging him to the court, where a proper, truly Stalinist political trial is in process against him. We've seen and heard enough. Jury, do your duty. Just watch us do our stuff ♪ We find the defendant guilty He's guilty, he's guilty ♪ Hooray! The Law is not only severe, ruthless, blind, at the same time, it mocks us. There is an obscene pleasure in practicing the Law. Our fundamental delusion today is not to believe in what is only a fiction, to take fictions too seriously. It's, on the contrary, not to take fictions seriously enough. You think it's just a game? It's reality. It's more real than it appears to you. For example, people who play video games, they adopt a screen persona of a sadist, rapist, whatever. The idea is, in reality I'm a weak person, so in order to supplement my real life weakness, I adopt the false image of a strong, sexually promiscuous person, and so on and so on. So this would be the naive reading. I want to appear stronger, more active, because in real life, I'm a weak person. But what if we read it in the opposite way? That this strong, brutal rapist, whatever, identity is my true self. In the sense that this is the psychic truth of myself and that in real life, because of social constraints and so on, I'm not able to enact it. So that, precisely because I think it's only a game, it's only a persona, a self-image I adopt in virtual space, I can be there much more truthful. I can enact there an identity which is much closer to my true self. We need the excuse of a fiction to stage what we truly are. Stalker is a film about a zone, a prohibited space where there are debris, remainders of aliens visiting us. And stalkers are people who specialized in smuggling foreigners who want to visit into this space where you get many magical objects. But the main among them is the room in the middle of this space, where it is claimed your desires will be realized. [in Russian] I know you're going to get mad. Anyway, I must tell you... We are now... on the threshold... This is the most important moment in your life. You must know that. Your innermost wishes will be made real here. Your most sincere wish. Born of suffering. The contrast between Solaris and Stalker is clear. In Solaris, we get id-machine as an object which realizes your nightmares, desires, fears, even before you ask for it, as it were. In Stalker it's the opposite, a zone where your desires, deepest wishes get realized on condition that you are able to formulate them. Which, of course, you are never able, which is why everybody fails once you get there in the center of the zone. [in Russian] You just make money using our... anguish! It's not even the money. You're enjoying yourself here. You're like God Almighty here. You, a hypocritical louse, decide who is to live and who is to die He deliberates! Now I see why you stalkers never enter the room yourselves. You revel in all that power, that mystery, your authority! What else is there to wish for? It's not true! You... you're mistaken. Tarkovsky's solution to this tension is that of religious obscurantism. The way out of this deadlock is a gesture of self-sacrifice. His last two films, Nostalgia and Sacrifice, both end up with some suicidal gesture of the hero. [woman in Russian] ...for the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand? But I don't think this is what makes Tarkovsky interesting. What makes him interesting is the very form of his films. Tarkovsky uses as this material element of pre-narrative density, time itself. All of a sudden we are made to feel this inertia, drabness of time. Time is not just a neutral, light medium within which things happen. We feel the density of time itself. Things that we see are more markers of time. He treats even humans in this way. If we look at the unique face of Stalker himself, it's a face of somebody exposed to too much radiation and, as it were, rotting, falling apart alive. It is this disintegration of the very material texture of reality which provides the spiritual depths. Tarkovskian subjects, when they pray, they don't look up, they look down. They even sometimes, as in Stalker, put their head directly onto the earth. Here, I think, Tarkovsky affects us at a level which is much deeper, much more crucial for our experience than all the standard, spiritual motives of elevating ourselves above material reality and so on. There is nothing specific about the zone. It's purely a place where a certain limit is set. You set a limit, you put a certain zone off-limit, and although things remain exactly the way they were, it's perceived as another place. Precisely as the place onto which you can project your beliefs, your fears, things from your inner space. In other words, the zone is ultimately the very whiteness of the cinematic screen. "To the people of this city we donate this monument; 'Peace and Prosperity'." [indiscernable oration] Chaplin's City Lights is one of those masterpieces which are really too sophisticated for the sophisticated. It's a deceptively simple movie. When we are enraptured by it, we tend to miss its complexity and extreme finesse. [indiscernable oration] Already, the first scene of the movie provides the co-ordinates. It's kind of a microcosm of Chaplin's entire art. What's the source of Chaplin's comic genius? What's the archetypal comic situation in Chaplin's films? It's being mistaken for somebody or functioning as a disturbing spot, as a disturbing stain. He distorts the vision. So he wants to erase himself, to get out of the picture. Or people don't even note him, take note of him, so he wants to be noted. Or, if they perceive him, he's misperceived, identified for what he is not. The tramp is wrongly identified, by a beautiful blind girl who is selling flowers on a street corner, as a millionaire. He accepts the game, helps her, even steals money to pay for her operation to restore her sight, then after he serves the punishment and returns, he tries to find her. And I think that this is the metaphor of our predicament. All too often, when we love somebody, we don't accept him or her as what the person effectively is. We accept him or her insofar as this person fits the co-ordinates of our fantasy. We misidentify, wrongly identify him or her, which is why, when we discover that we were wrong, love can quickly turn into violence. There is nothing more dangerous, more lethal for the loved person than to be loved, as it were, for not what he or she is, but for fitting the ideal. In this case, love is always mortifying love. Here it's not only the tramp as the figure within the film's narrative exposing himself to his beloved girl, it's at the same time Chaplin as actor/director exposing himself to us, the public. "I am shameless. I am offering myself to you, but at the same time, I am afraid." The true genius of Chaplin resides in the way he was able to stage this psychological moment of recognition at the level of form, music, visual aspect, and at the same time, at the level of acting. When the two hands meet, the girl finally recognizes him for what he is. This moment is always extremely dangerous, pathetic. The beloved falls out of the frame of the idealized co-ordinates, finally there exposed in his psychological nakedness. "Here I am as what I really am." And I don't think we have to read it as a happy ending. We don't know what will happen. We have the letters, "THE END", the black screen, but the singing goes on. As if the emotion is now too strong, it spills over the very frame. In order to understand today's world, we need cinema, literally. It's only in cinema that we get that crucial dimension which we are not ready to confront in our reality. If you are looking for what is in reality more real than reality itself, look into the cinematic fiction.
