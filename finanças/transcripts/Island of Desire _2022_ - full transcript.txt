--== McEphie ==-- Carlo. Carlo, Jennifer's crying. Hey, Carlo! Jesus, Martha! No one is crying. Jennifer's gone. Let me sleep. Leave me alone. I'm tired! So annoying. You didn't sleep again last night. Don't you know that's bad for you? I don't know. Get up. Let's go to your mom's. Then we'll drop by at Dr. Yulo's. Come on! You woke me up again last night. You said you could hear Jennifer crying. For god's sake, Martha. We both know that Jennifer is gone. She was a stillborn baby. She's gone. It's about time you accepted that. We're going to see Dr. Yulo. Answer her questions properly. Just cooperate with her so you'll recover faster. Hey, cousin! How have you been? Come on in. Come in! I'm so glad you could drop by! Thanks for being here, Weng. Love. Go ahead. I need to make a call. Alright. Don't be long. Sorry for barging in like this. I brought fruits for mother. Don't be silly! We're family. Auntie will love these. That's a nice photo of her, isn't it? That was from our outing a long time ago. - You were just ten at the time. - Ten. Ten years old! Mama looks so happy here. Oh, it's Aurora. Auntie still keeps asking for her. Oh, I'm sorry… I wonder where she is now. I love that picture of her! That was from her last birthday party before she got sick. She looks so beautiful! This is my favorite photo of her. - That's right. - One of her best photos. Come on up. She's waiting for you. Mama! Mama, I've missed you. How are you? Who are you? Hey! Switch it back on! I was watching that! Auntie, someone's here to see you. It's Martha. Mama, it's me, Martha. Your daughter. I brought fruits for you. Thank you. You're such a nice girl. You brought me fruits. Whose child are you? Is Aurora home yet? Hey. I asked you a question. Is Aurora home yet? Ma, sister hasn't called. That's so like her. She just leaves whenever she wants. She doesn't even tell me where she's going. Could you call her again? Maybe she'll pick up this time. Tell her to please come home. I want to see her again. Okay. I'll have your other daughter give her a call. Your daughter Martha. Do you still remember her? Martha? Who's Martha? Excuse me, I just need to step out. Alright. Let me know if Aurora's back. Check if she's arrived. Yes, Auntie, we will. That's enough. Don't mind what she says. She's not well, Martha. It just really hurts, Weng. I understand. Don't cry anymore, Martha. Let's go. She might hear you. Let's go back down. Come on. What did I tell you? She's still looking for Aurora. Be patient with her. She's going senile. Well, Carlo and I have to go ahead. We have a doctor's appointment. We don't want to be late. Sure, if it can't be helped. Please take care of mother. I'll leave you to it, okay? Thank you. I'll see you out. Hear me out, Helen. I can't just leave Martha. Alright, I'll come see you after her doctor's appointment. Okay? - Wait for me. - Carlo! Let's go. Thank you very much. Thank you, Doc. Thank you, Doc. De Jesus? - Good afternoon, Doc. - Good afternoon! Come in, come in! Thanks, Doc. Alright. Hello. How are you? I'm doing okay. How are you feeling, Martha? I feel fine. And light. Okay, so… We'll be giving you a series of questions because this is part of the process for us to find out your current state of mind. Okay, Doc. Okay? So Mr. De Jesus, could you please step out of the room for a while? Okay, Doc. Okay. Have a seat, please. Feel comfortable. Thank you. Feel comfortable. You may put down your bag. Shall we get started? Okay, Doc. Okay. So, have you been feeling happy these past seven days? Yes, Doc. Okay. How often? Martha? Not often. Nothing special. How optimistic have you been these past seven days? Are you still able to laugh? Not really. What do you mean by 'not really'? Sometimes, Doc, I think about my daughter. I just stare at nothing when that happens. Do you feel guilt? Do you blame yourself for what happened? Yes, Doc. What are those instances where you feel like it's your fault? Whenever I see Carlo with his mistress. I feel like... I feel like that's my fault, too. I let myself go ever since I gave birth. Whatever's happening to our bodies is not our fault. It's normal for women to feel these things especially after going through a pregnancy. Doc, my husband doesn't have sex with me anymore. Have you been feeling anxious these past seven days? Yes, all the time. Feeling afraid and apprehensive out of the blue? Yes, Doc. Mr. De Jesus, may I have a word with you, please? Okay, Doc. Doc, how's my wife doing? She's not doing so well. According to her results on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, she is going through a Postpartum Depression. What should we do, Doc? Psychotherapy works well as she begins selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. But then again, none of that matters if she doesn't have a solid family support system. So my recommendation is for you to take care of your wife. - Okay? - Okay, Doc. And I wrote this prescription. I hope you buy it for her. Okay, Doc. Let's go. Thank you, Doc. Yeah, you're welcome. Thanks, Doc. - Sir. - Ma'am! Please give me some food! I'm hungry. Ma'am, just a bit of food. Your wife is beautiful, sir. Man, you're lucky. Come on. I don't want to be out late on the road. - Sir! Money for food, sir! - Get out of here! Beggars aren't allowed here. Leave! You're so stingy, sir! Leave! Ma'am! Please give me some food! Leave. Beggars aren't allowed here. Sir, I'm hungry! Are you going to give me something to eat, sir? Leave! Beggars aren't allowed here. Sir, I'm hungry, sir! Beggars aren't allowed here. This stupid car won't start! Damn it. Who were you talking to earlier at mom's house? My workmate. For fuck's sake! Helen resigned from your company, didn't she? How could she still be your workmate? Jesus! Fuck. Sorry, Martha. Sir, ma'am, please give me something! Move! Please, sir! Love, that's enough! Hey, fucker, if you don't move, I'll run you over! Carlo, I said enough! Can't you see he's crazy? I just need money for food. Damn it. Sir! Sir! Money to buy food, sir. Sir, I don't need much! Sir, just to buy food, sir. Take pity on me, sir. I haven't had dinner, sir! Please, sir. Take pity on me. Carlo, do you still love me? Martha, let's pick up your meds at the pharmacy. Dr. Yulo prescribed you some medicine. Did you really love me, Carlo? Martha, let's just talk about this at home. Why can't we talk about it now? We can talk about it at home. No. Carlo, tell me what you want to say right now! You really want to do this? Yes! I'm done! You are? You don't want this anymore, Carlo? Martha! What the hell! Martha! In the name of the Lord, I am here before you today to proclaim the Word of God. And to describe to you how the Lord Jesus Christ changed my life. Let's all close our eyes and bow our heads. I'd like to begin with a prayer Lord, we pray for the presence of the Holy Spirit to move your hearts and stir your minds so that it becomes clear that the most important thing in this world is to accept You as our Lord and Savior through Jesus Christ. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen! Mister, which way is the hospital? That way, ma'am. Thank you. Good evening, ma'am. Where is the Regional Health Unit Office? At the end of the hallway. Thank you. Yes? Good evening. Hi, good evening. I'm Doctor Rose Yulo. Yes? Have a seat! My name is Martha De Jesus. I was sent by the Central Office to work at the regional unit of Isla Bato's health center. Okay. Martha De Jesus. Yes? Is there a problem? Nothing, I didn’t mean to stare. Okay. Are you married? Yes, Doc. I ask because this job is demanding. You only get to go home once a month. Sometimes... You don't get to go home at all. It depends on the situation. Are you sure you know what you're getting into? Duty calls, doc. Okay. I just wanted to be clear on that. I'll endorse this to HR. Oh! By the way... Could you... When you reach... When you get to Isla Bato, please give this to Dr. Emmanuel Eusebio. What's in the box, Doc? Medicine for the Indigenous Peoples. They were expecting this last month. Okay, Doc. I'll make sure it gets delivered. This is very important. Make sure it gets to the people who need it, okay? Doc, where do I get a ride to the docks going to Isla Bato? Why don't you spend the night here? You can stay at the staff quarters. You can hire one of the tricycles that pass by in the morning. Just tell them you're going to the docks. Alright. Thank you, Doc. Okay. Thank you! Mister? Mister. Is this the boat going to Isla Bato? Nobody sets sail to that place. Mister. Mister! Mister, I'm a nurse from Manila. I just came from the Municipal Health Office. My boss said this is where I can get a boat going to Isla Bato. We don't set sail for that island anymore, ma'am. Isla Bato? Yes, sir. Let me help you with your luggage. It's heavy. What's in it? It's for the natives. Take care of yourself out there. The road is perilous. Thank you. Thank you, Mister. Mister, is this the way to the health center? Yes, ma'am. Could you take me? Hop on, I'll take you there. An offering to our Beloved Father! From our hearts! An offering to our Beloved Father! From our hearts! An offering to our Beloved Father! A christening! An offering to our Beloved Father! From our hearts! An offering to our Beloved Father! A christening! Are you sure this is it? Yes. Look. Isla Bato Lying-in Clinic. Let me help you. No need, I can do it. Thanks. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Okay, I'm off. Is someone there? Good morning, ma'am. Who is it? I'm the nurse sent by the Ministry Health Central Office in Manila. I'm Martha de Jesus. I'm Tess. Midwife here at Isla Bato. Come, have a seat. Thank you. May I ask where I can find Dr. Emmanuel Eusebio? You just missed him. This morning, he set out to the other side. When did he say he was coming back? I brought the medicine he needed. That's the one over there. Dr. Yulo sent it for him. Where do we keep these? In the pharmacy. This is more than enough. Please send Dr. Yulo our thanks. Maybe we could distribute some for the people on the island. They're for the natives of Sitio Lakas. There's enough to go around. I'm sure we can spare some for the locals. Many of them have been asking when the next free checkup is going to be. Okay, Tess. We'll set aside a supply for the locals. When's the free checkup? Nurse! Nurse! Help us! Our baby's coming! Help! Please help her! Ma'am! Gently. The baby's coming! We'll handle this. I'll be here, Pilar. Take her inside. Calm down. Thank you so much, Nando. It's a good thing we saw her on the road! I'll go ahead. I'll leave you to it. Mister Ambo, please calm down. I need to attend to her. Our baby's coming. Over here please. Okay, just go easy. Just relax. One, two, three. Please remove- Alright... One, two, three! Lift it. Lift it up! Lift it up! Okay, nice and easy. There we go. - Martha! - Wait, wait! - Here! - Can you gets some towels? Wait, ma'am, please. Ambo! Miss Belen, please calm down. You can do it, Miss Belen. - I'll grab the towels! - Thank you, Martha! Try to relax, okay? You can do it, Miss Belen! I'll go get the hot water. Okay, hurry up. Here it comes. Are you ready? Okay? Push! Give me that, okay. Try to relax, okay? One more, Miss Belen. You're almost there. One, two... Push! Yes, here it comes! Just one more. One last, Miss Belen. One, two, three, push! Keep going. One, two, three, push! One last push. Just one more. One last, Miss Belen. One big push. Tess! Carlo! Where are you going? I'm going to see the natives of Sitio Lakas. Take care on the road. Thanks, Tess. Ah, Martha… What is it? About what you saw... It's nothing. Thank you. Tess? Yes? I had a dream last night. A patient was rushed here. She gave birth to a snake and… it bit you. What's that wound on your neck? Must've scratched myself in the bathroom. Tess. It's just a dream. You better get going before dark. Alright. In the name of the Blessed Father! This is a blessed day! - You, Salve, shall be delivered from evil! - What's going on, Mister? And this sacred oil shall heal you when I apply it on your blind eyes. Heal her, Father! Heal her, Father! Heal her, Father! I can see! I can see! May god bless you, Father! May god bless you, Father! Follow her. Yes, Father. Come with me. Come on! Let's go after her! Hurry! After her! Let's go after her! Hurry up! Run! After her! Faster! We'll catch up to her! Faster! Go after her! Hey! Run faster! Hey! Run faster! Help! Help me! After her, hurry! Go after her! Hurry up! She's getting away! Hurry! Go after her! Faster! Go after her! What's happening? It won't start? I think it died. Let's walk the rest of the way. Okay, I'll help you. Let's rest here for a bit. Okay, just for a short while. Are we anywhere near Sitio Lakas? We're close. About half an hour ride. Give me that. Thanks. Aren't you that nurse from the docks? The one I took to the Health Center? That's me. Let's sit over here. I'm Leloy, by the way. Martha. Why was Nando's group chasing you? I'm not sure, Leloy. I just peeked into their chapel. The line was so long, there were people waiting outside. Then I saw someone performing a healing. That's Father. He's the leader of the sect here in Isla Bato. He cures his devotees. Is molesting them part of the healing ritual? Come, let's go swimming! I can't. I still have to get these to the natives. Look, it's calling for us! We can swim before we leave! Come on! Wait! Come on! Come on! I can't join you. I didn't bring extra clothes. I only have my uniform. Come on. Come here! Come on. You can leave that for now. Where are you going? Hang on, I'll go get the medicine and put on my uniform. Make way. Good afternoon. My name is Nurse Martha De Jesus. I assist Dr. Emmanuel Eusebio in responding to your medical needs. And this is Leloy. He's my guide. - Good day, ma'am. - Good afternoon. - Please have a seat. - Help her. Thanks. Sorry we got delayed. I'm new here. Aljun! Aljun, come over here. You keep running around that's why your coughing won't let up. For how long has he been coughing? For a week. Can I take a look at him? Yes, ma'am. Come here. Look up. Open your mouth. Tongue out. Leloy, please hand me the bottle. Everything seems normal. But here, I'm going to give you something for it. Give this to him. One tablespoon before bed. It'll make him a bit drowsy. And in the morning, after breakfast, you can have him take another tablespoon. But just once a day. Thank you so much. Willie! The doctors are here. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. I'm a nurse. Where is Doc Emmanuel? Dr. Emmanuel is not here so I'll be taking over in his stead. May I have a look? Yes, ma'am. Does it hurt? It hurts and I think it's been getting worse for a week now. Apart from this, do you feel pain anywhere else? No, ma'am. Okay, I will recommend you for a follow-up checkup when Dr. Emmanuel arrives. For now... Hand me the ointment. I can give you this ointment. Take baths more often and wipe your skin with warm water. And never scratch your wounds. If you do scratch them and you get blisters, apply this ointment. Thank you, ma'am. Okay, sir. Miss Berta is giving birth! Who's giving birth? The lady who lives over there! Okay, I'll take care of it. - I'm a nurse. - I'll show you where she is. The nurse is here! Stay here, Leloy. No men allowed inside, just the husband, okay? Please come inside. Miss Berta? Miss Berta? - Get me a basin of hot water. - Okay, ma'am. Please hurry! Miss Berta, just relax. Try to relax. Here we go. Hold your wife's head. Okay, ma'am. There you are, Miss Berta. We're going to push, okay? Okay, you can do it. One, two, three, push! Keep going, Miss Berta. Try to relax. Deep breaths. Deep breaths. Here it comes. Push! Here it comes. Push! Here it comes, Miss Berta! Almost there! Is everything okay? May I see my baby? Is there a problem? That's not my baby! Get that away from me! What is that? That's not my baby! Where are we? It's gotten dark. We can spend the night here. We can go back to Poblacion in the morning. What's the matter? Ever since I came to this island, I've been having strange dreams. You're probably just tired from the trip. You should get some rest. Move. Move aside. Poor thing. Please move aside. They look like they're dead. Coming through. - Is the woman still alive? - Please move. Move aside, please. Mister, what happened? Thanks for coming with me, Leloy. It's nothing. Thanks for helping people here on the island. Wait, stop here. - Huh? - Let's wait here, Leloy. Why? What is that? What's going on? I don't know. The corpse looks like it's rotting away. By the looks of it, it could spread some disease. That's how the ritual of passing is done here on the island. My sister! Aurora! Aurora! Hey! Martha! - Aurora! - Where are you going? Aurora! - Martha! Where are you going? - Aurora! Aurora! A peaceful... journey! A peaceful... journey! A peaceful... journey! A peaceful... journey! We are gathered here today to witness the crossing of our sister Belen. Though she did not find true happiness in our paradise, I pray to our Maker that He may guide her as she crosses to the next life! Receive her, Father! Receive her, Father! Receive her, Father! Most blessed Father! Most blessed Father! Most blessed Father! Long live, most blessed Father! Ambo? Belen! Belen? Belen! Belen! Your wife has crossed over. She is not coming back. Yes, Father.

I'll just drop this off then I'll go straight to the station. It's fine, you might need something else. What about your boat? My buddy can take care of it. Mister, watch over my boat, okay? Thanks. I was wondering... How old are you? 25. Are you living with someone? No. Where's your family? I'm the only one left on the island. What about your parents? They're on the other side. Where's this "other side" I keep hearing about? They also told me Dr. Eusebio's on the other side. You'll know when it's your time to cross over. Mister, to the town, please. Get down from there! Get down from there! That's enough! Get down from there! Get down here! Get down here! Mister. Mister... Isn't this the Regional Health Unit Office? What's that? Where's Dr. Yulo's office? I don't know who that is. Hey! That's enough. Playtime's over. Enough! Do you want this? You can have it! Hey! Are you okay? I told you I don't want to take a shower! You're so annoying! I told you I don't want to take a shower! I don't want to! Miss? Miss, I'm looking for Dr. Rose Yulo of the Regional Health Unit Office. Doc Rose? What's the matter? Where's the doctor? Doc Yulo has passed away. What? Since when? For more than a year now. What the hell are you talking about? I just spoke with her last week! - I'm telling you, Doc Rose is dead! - Doc Yulo is still alive. Guard! Someone's trying to make trouble. Doctor Rose is not dead. I need to talk to her. Show me where Doctor Yulo is! I need to... Let go of me! Nurse, emergency! Let's go. We can rest up in my house. Let's go. This is your house? Love? Love. Love, wake up. You're going to be late. What time is it? Wake up, love. Get up. Love… We can do that when you get back. You should get going. I made you coffee because I know you don't eat breakfast. Thank you. You should get ready.

One day, you just left us. We haven't stopped looking for you. Mother, especially. Martha, you don't belong here. Aurora, come with me. Let's go back to Manila. Mom is waiting for you. I can't go back. I have nothing to go back to. But you, Martha... You still have a choice. Aurora, please. Please. Martha, a deluge is coming. Martha, we're almost there. Hang in there. Hang in there. Hang in there, Martha! Stick it out a little longer. We're almost there. Somebody! Help! Please help us! Help us! Somebody! Help! Help! Please help us!

Hail, Mary, full of grace, Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Aurora… Condolence, Martha. Thank you. Martha… You need to leave Isla Bato once Leloy crosses over. Aurora, you're my sister. I'm not leaving without you. I warned you, Martha. I told you right from the start to leave this place! Why don't you want to come with me? What's so special about this island? I'm already dead, Martha. I'm not joking around with you. Make a choice. You're going to go with Leloy as he crosses over, or you're going back to your family. Screw all that talk about crossing over! I'm not going to leave you here. I'm staying. You've made your choice. In the Name of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. Lord, have mercy on us Christ, have mercy on us Lord, have mercy on us Leloy's passing to the other side together with his fellow fishermen is a tragedy that will be etched in our minds for years to come in Isla Bato. Father has put a curse upon us! Father's curse! Because we don't follow his commandments! We have forgotten our faith in Him! Forgive us, Father! Leloy is ready to leave and pass on to the other side. It's destiny! But he was delayed because of this foreign seductress! The other fishermen shouldn't have been dragged down into the waters with him. But in Father's wrath... You killed my husband! All of this is your fault! No! I didn’t do anything! That's not true! Seize her! Let go! I didn't do anything! Let her go! Get your hands off of her! Martha, run! Father! Aurora! Let me go! Father! Go after her! All clear? Clear! Clear! All clear? Clear! Clear! Help!

To the other side? I'm going back to Manila. I'm going back to my family. You don't have anywhere left to go. What do you mean? You've made your choice. Come on, hop in. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
