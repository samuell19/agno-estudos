CLERK: These are all large on the second shelf. The prices range from $7.95 to $22.95. They're all cotton, all American made. CUSTOMER: Okay. CLERK: Is it a gift. CUSTOMER: Yes, it is. Hi. CLERK: Hi. May I help you? Yeah. I'm looking for, like, a man's work-shirt; corduroy, or something long. Yeah, right over here. Any specific color? Tan. That's good. That's good. Alright. Any specific size? Medium's good. You have a medium. Yeah, we have a medium right here. Are you new in the neighborhood? Yeah, as a matter of fact. I'm just passing through. But, a friend of mine told me I could get some good bargains here. So, here I am. No kidding? No kidding. Well, I think I'm going to take this one. Where's your dressing room? Right up there. Okay. Thank you. That's it. Now. Now! Yeah. How you doing in there? WOMAN: I don't know. The shoulders are a little big. But the color's good, so... I don't know. Do you think it'll shrink if I put it in the washer? No. Just don't put it in the dryer. Yes! This shirt's coming out of your check. Not mine! ( Shout ) Morning, Rick. How you doing? Not bad, Mr. Emory. How you doing? Well, I'm a little tired. Little too much peace and quiet around here. Find it hard to get to sleep. Sure miss that traffic on Houston street. Yeah, it is pretty quiet around here. Pretty boring too! Only thing I hear all night is my mom crying. At least back at school there were some people for me to talk to. Actually, that pretty much sucked too. When did your father die? About nine weeks ago. I've been home about six. Thank god you came to town and opened up. I mean, not only is this a halfway decent job, at least your alive. What do you mean? Haven't you noticed? Nobody talks to you in this town! Because I'm new around here, they treat me like I... Like I got AIDS or something. I have got to get out of here. Oh! No offense, I mean... This is a great job and all, but... You understand? No problem. No problem. In fact, it did strike me that no one goes out of their way to be friendly when they come in to rent a tape. But, I just figured because I was new in town. My wife seems to find the gals down at the courthouse friendly enough. Hey, look, after New York, "Howdy" is a long conversation. Yeah, and at least they're supporting the business. You know, there must be 50 tapes in the drop-slot over there. Well, I'm not knocking it. Thank god business is brisk. But it does surprise me. It seems like everyone who comes in here has had a VCR for at least a year or so. And the nearest rental store is about 15 miles away! I guess they were just happy to tape off of cable. What cable? Aint no cable in Frenchtown! And the reception's for shit too! And they don't allow any of those "satellite dishes". This is weird. I don't think that's one of your tapes. Let me see. You're right. This isn't a rental. They must've left my tape in the machine and returned one of their blank cassettes instead. It happens. Put it aside. They'll realize the mistake and be back in later. You want to watch it? No, not exactly. It's probably just a bad tape of yesterday's ballgame, or some stupid soap-opera. Just put it aside. Alright. But, look, if they don't come in soon, let's watch it. Huh? I'm dying to see what these yokels consider "entertainment". How are you today? Get something for you? You got that "chainsaw movie"? I'll get it. Are you a club member? "261..." 261's okay. Okay. That'll be $3.15 with the governor. Bye. That's exactly what I'm talking about! Friendly, huh? I'll tell you what's strange to me. When I had my movie theater in New York, all anybody wanted to talk about was movies. I mean, I'd go stand out and mingle with the people waiting on line, or standing in the lobby, and - Everyone was a critic. They all wanted to talk about the new Woody Allen, or the new Spielberg film, and I figured that would carry over into the video business! But, all these people want are horror movies and slasher films. And occasionally a "XXXer" from the back. Right! So, aren't you dying to see what's on this blank tape? Okay, okay. Put it on. I just hope whoever goofed up doesn't come in while we're watching it! VIDEO: Shit, Howard! He aint gonna be easy to cut with his hands tied up like this! Holy shit! This looks very, very real. Hey man! That is real! That guy getting cut up is Reggie Hobbs! He's the freaking post-master! At least he was. I mean, he supposedly retired down to Florida a few weeks ago. Well, couldn't this be some kind of joke? Maybe it's a play or a scene from a movie, or something. ( Laughter ) CAMERAMAN: Will you stop wiggling around! I can't get a decent shot. Okay. Okay. Okay. Put the camera down for a minute and hold up his hand, so I can cut! ( Laughter ) What the hell are we going to do? I mean, we've got to report this! I mean, that guy could be dying some where! Do you know what this means? Here! Hold this! Let me get the camera. Okay. How's this? Oh, perfect! Oh, bummer, man! I spilled my beer! Yeah, you sure did. Wait! I almost forgot! My latest toy! ( Laughter ) One of my club members is a psychotic killer and we've got his tape! Maybe neither sleet nor snow will stop the US Postal Service, but a good ol' hammer, machete, and hedge-clipper will! ( Laughter ) Yeah! Look at that baby squirm! ( Laughter ) Look, I'm gonna go see the police. I got to tell someone about this. Well, wait! What if whoever left that tape here comes back looking for it? Who would be stupid enough to claim this? He doesn't know we watched it! Alright, look, I'm gonna lock the door. You stay here with the tape, and I'll try and get a cop to come back with me. Alright. I'll put up the "Closed" sign. Just stay out of sight and don't open it for anybody! Just hurry up, huh? I'll be back as soon as I can. ( Door handle jiggles ) ( Typing with one finger ) Hi. My name is Steven Emory. I run the Video Store down on Main street. And I need to see the chief of police. Well, maybe I can help you. No. I think I really ought to talk to the chief. Suit yourself. Hold on. Chief, there's a Mr... Sorry, chief. There's a Mr. Emory out here. He's got a problem. Right. Mr. Emory, go right through that door. How are you, Mr. Emory? How's business? Our little town supporting you? Yes. Fine, fine. Thank you. Listen. I think I've got a serious problem. Oh? What's the problem, Mr. Emory? This morning we found a tape in our drop-box. That's a drop-slot we have so people can return tapes before the store opens. Anyway, we found this tape that didn't belong to us. So, Rick suggested we put it on - Now, hold on. Rick, who? Rick Carlson. He's the kid who works for me. Oh, right. Bart's kid. He's a little wild, isn't he? No, I don't think he's wild. A little confused, maybe; what with his father dying, and now having to take care of his mother. Anyway... We put the tape on, and it... It was the tape of a murder. So? Well, don't you have a lot of tapes like that? "Shoot 'em ups", huh? No. You don't understand. It was like a home movie, except shot on video! And the victim was - or, Rick swears the victim was - the post-master. Old Reggie! Yeah. Reggie Hobbs. Oh, come on! You saw Reggie Hobbs get wasted! Yeah! He was all tied up on a mattress, or something, and some guy stabbed him to death. Some guy? Who? I have no idea. You can't see their faces. You been drinking, Mr. Emory? Brought back some "funny drugs" from New York, huh? Absolutely not. I'm very serious! Well... Even if I believed your story, - which I don't - couldn't have happened. Because old Reg packed up and went down to Florida to a condo with his daughter over two months ago. And I ought to know! Because I took him to New York Airport myself. Now, I don't know what kind of practical joke you got going here, but you are wasting my time! Here, look at this. That's from Florida. Look, whether you believe me or not, I have the proof back at my store. Remember? The video tape! Just come with me for five minutes and I'll show it to you. Rick's guarding it now! You gotta be shittin' me! Look, whether it's old Reg or not, someone's been murdered, and I have a tape of it. You owe it to take a look at it. Okay! Seeing as you're new here! Seeing as your wife works for the court clerk. And seeing as my kids rent tapes from you, I'll give you five minutes of my time. But, if you are fucking with me, you are gonna be pretty sorry! I'm not fucking with you! Just come with me. Please! Lou, I'm gonna accompany Mr. Emory here over to his store. To investigate a "possible murder". Hold down the fort, I wont take long. When I left, this was locked. Rick, it's me. Come on out. I got the chief with me. Rick? Rick! Rick! Rick! So much for "Mr. Reliability", huh? He must have gotten scared and bolted. But the tapes still here! Just hold on a second. I'll put it on for you. It's right at the head of this tape. If I wasn't so freaking pissed off, I'd laugh at your little joke, Mr. Emory! I know you're not gonna believe it. But why would I try and pull a stunt like this? I have no idea. I'm not saying I don't believe that you don't believe what's you say. But, obviously, someone is having a little joke with you, Mr. Emory, and my money's on that assistant of yours. So, let's just chalk this up to a vivid imagination and a not very funny practical joke. Now, I'm just gonna forget this whole thing. But, my advice is, you lay off them monster movies for a while. You stick with the kiddie stuff, Mr. Emory. Now, wait a minute, chief. I know what I saw. Someone obviously switched the tapes while the store was empty. Chief! ( Door closes ) Dammit! Shit! I do wish that you would eat something. You just picked at your dinner! Look, Steve, if you ask me, this whole thing was concocted by Rick. All you have to do is look at his history. He quits college midstream, and then his father's death, and now the poor kid has to take care of his mother. I mean, we left New York to escape to peace and quiet. But this atmosphere is probably driving him crazy! It was just his way of stirring up a little excitement. Well, what about the post-master? Did you recognize him? No. But, Rick did. WIFE: That's just my point. Rick could've set you up for the whole bit. You know, he probably just taped a horror movie off of television. No. The whole thing was shot on video. I mean, it had the same quality as a soap-opera, or one of those rotten commercials. Not a film. Then maybe he video-taped some of his friends? He doesn't have any friends. Steve! Or any video equipment as far as I know. And all morning long, all he talked about was the strange behavior of the townies. What do you mean? Don't you find it just a bit bizarre that in the few short weeks we've been here, we've got - What? - close to 300 members? That's almost the whole population of this one horse town! And why do they all have VCRs? Since when are you complaining about business being good, huh? I mean, we are so damn lucky! I left a cushy job at a law firm, and you left your childhood dream of running a movie theater. You know, we could've picked a town where maybe three people owned VCRs. Alright. I'm not complaining. This whole thing's just got me a little shaken up. I mean, it would take a lot to convince me that I didn't see a pretty gory snuff film! As far as Rick is concerned, if it's a joke, then I've got a problem with my only employee. Well, my only "missing" employee. And if it it isn't a joke, then Rick could be up shit's creek. I don't care what you say, this thing gives me the creeps. I'm getting pretty nervous about it. Now wait a minute, what do you mean missing? Maybe I shouldn't have left him alone so long. You left him alone in the store with the money? That's not the point. The point is when we got back, he wasn't there. And the money was! And the door was wide open. And I had locked it. And somebody had to switch the original tape with someone's stupid home movie. Okay. Alright. Why don't we just try to be logical about this whole thing. Maybe, tomorrow morning, Rick will show up for work. But if not, you call his mother, and see if she knows anything. Now, I can look through the records at the town hall, and I can see if I can probably get a phone number for post-master Hobbs down in Florida. I can call him with some question about his social security number, or some other red tape. Why don't we just forget about it for tonight. Okay? I mean, everything will become clear in the morning. Okay. What's the rating on this? Huh? The rating. What is it? Oh, it's probably written on there. "R". Oh, is that for nudity? I really don't know. But, I doubt it's for nudity, it's probably for all the violence. Oh, good! Okay. Then I'll take it. The kids can watch it. "Blood Cult". Okay. That'll be $2.00. There you go. Thanks. Hurry up, Howard! I don't know how long she's gonna be out! Okay! Okay! I'm trying to hurry, but you want me to get it right, don't you? Yeah. Alright. But, let me know when you're ready. Okay. Okay, I'm rolling. Here's Eli! Good evening ladies and gentleman, and welcome to The Eli Show, brought to you from our Basement Collection. Good! Good! You look real good, Eli! Thanks! Thanks, Howard! We're here with tonights guest, Miss Lori Edwards. Age: 28. I picked up Miss Edwards hitchhiking on the edge of town, and slipped her a little sedative. She should be waking up any minute now. And how are we going to dispose of tonight's guest, Eli? Well, we have a few choices. First, there's the straight-edge razor. Then, the scissors. And, of course, there's that all time favorite, the icepick. Hmm! Well, it seems our guest is beginning to wake up, Eli. Mmm hmm. These are late. Okay. Don't I owe you a late charge or something? Yeah. Sure. You owe me $4.00. Thanks. Do you know Rick Carlson? Well, yeah. He works here doesn't he? Yeah. He just didn't come in to work today. Well, call him at home. See you on the weekend? Ladies and gentlemen, it seems as if our guest is waking from her beauty sleep. Let's see what she has to say for herself. And remember ladies and gentleman, this is brought to you live and unrehearsed. We are not actors! But, everyday people, just like yourselves. ( Laughter ) ( Muffled speech ) Good morning, Laurie! I'm Eli, and this is my co-host Howard. And we're going to torture and kill you on network television. What do you think about that? I don't think she likes that idea very much! I bet she'd like some. Go ahead and give her some. I'll get a closeup! ( Screaming ) You poured it down her chest! Yeah, I noticed. ( Laughter ) And now the beer chaser! ( Laughing ) Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is a first! A wet T-shirt contest! Basement Tapes has done it again! For the first time on network television, a beer wet T-shirt contest! Hey! Maybe our audience would like to see them uncovered! Without the wet T-shirt! Good idea, Howard! But, we've got a slight problem. I can't get the shirt over her head. No problem, Eli. How about those scissors! Howard! What would I do without you? ( Laughter ) Oh, get that other side! Not too close! Very nice! Now, what's next, Eli? Hmm? ( Phone ringing ) Hello? Rick? No, he's not here. Who is this, please? Oh! Well, he went to Boston last night to visit a friend. No. I don't. There's no number that I have where you can reach him. I'm sorry. I don't... Listen. There's something on the stove. I'm gonna have to go. I will. Oh, I will. Yes. If he calls, I'll tell him you were asking for him. Yes. Alright. Good bye. Well, let me think. We've still got the straight-edge. And, the icepick. Hey, I've got an idea! How about carving your name on her with the straight razor? Brilliant, Howard! Absolutely brilliant! "E"! "L"! "I"! Now, what do we use to dot the "I"? The icepick! Put it in slow, Eli! Slowly! Well, Eli. I think she's dead now. Yep, Howard. That's the end of tonight's program. Tune in next week for future Basement videos. This is your host, Eli, signing off. Pleasant dreams. Hi, Rachel? Yeah. I finished working on that file that you wanted, and I have everything right there. Great. Okay? Yes. Thank you very much. Okay. And now lets go to lunch now, please! Well, why don't you go on ahead. I brought my lunch with me today. I've got some things to take care of. Oh, okay. Can I get you anything? No. No thanks. Okay, hon. I'll see you later. Okay. Bye bye. RECORDING: I'm sorry. All long distance circuits are busy. Please try your call again later. Damn! Here. These are on time. Thanks. Yes. Operator? Operator, I have been trying to reach a number in Florida for about twenty minutes now, and I cannot seem to get through. OPERATOR: I'm sorry. I will complete the call for you. Hello? Oh, you got him! Who's this? This is Rachel Emory. I work for the borough hall. Oh! Well, how do you do young lady? I don't believe I ever met you. What can I do for you? Well, you see, I was just working on the files for the employee benefits, and there seems to be some kind of discrepancy in your social security number. I was wondering if you could repeat that for me, please? Certainly, young lady. Yes. It's 157-42-0708. Yeah! That's it. No, no. No trouble at all. You're most welcome. ( Phone ringing ) Hello. Oh, hi. You reached him? And the numbers check out! Oh, Christ! Yeah, well guess what? I just got another blank cassette left on my counter. No. I don't know who left it. We were kind of busy in here and someone just left it. No. I was about to look at it when the phone rang. Yeah, okay. I'll call you back. Bye. ELI: It's one of these! HOWARD: Alright. Open her up. ELI: Shit! That's not it. HOWARD: There he is. I got a knife! Get the fuck out of here! Shit! ELI: How's it going Ricky, baby? Aww, Ricky! Hi, Rick! Smile for the camera! You think you can do to me what you did to old man Hobbs, huh? ELI: Old man Hobbs, huh? HOWARD: He knows about Hobbs! Emory and the cops are on their way here right now! ELI: I'm not so sure about that, Ricky. HOWARD: So, why don't you just put down the knife, and lets talk about it. HOWARD: There's no way out, Ricky! I'll give you the tape! I didn't see shit. HOWARD: You'll give us what? ELI: Hey! He's gonna give us the tape! How's this? Should I kill him here? HOWARD: No! There's not enough light. HOWARD: Bring him against this wall! Does this look good? Yeah. Now let me get in close. Hey, get him off the ground. Sure! Oh, sorry about this Rick. I think he's dead! What did you think: 1 to 10? I think it's a 10! I think it's a wrap! Alright, let's get rid of him. Let's get out of here, and get the tape. Mrs. Emory, please. Hi, it's me. You're not gonna fucking believe this. Guess what was on the tape? Rick being strangled to death here in the store! Yeah, I recognize my own store, and it was definitely Rick! No, I'm gonna take it to the police. Yeah. Can you meet me at home? Okay. I'll see you then. ( Typing with one finger ) Evening, Mr. Emory. Got something I can do for you? Yeah. I'm afraid I need to see the chief again. Well, what is it this time, Mr. Emory? Another act of "video violence"? Yeah. Something like that. Let me see if he can see you. Yeah, chief. There's a Mr. Emory here to see you again. Right. ( Door closes ) So, Mr. Emory? What is it this time? Look, chief. This time you're gonna have to believe me. I have in my hand a video tape that was left at my store. And on it is the murder of Rick Carlson. Jesus Christ, Emory! I have had enough of this bullshit! Now, I have checked on Carlson myself. And he's in Boston with some friends. Now, why don't you just turn around and get the hell out of my office! Please. Do you have a VCR here at this station? Yeah. Yeah, it so happens we do. We video tape the drunk drivers. And I suppose you want me to play that tape? It'll prove me out once and for all, wont it? Well, I suppose it will. And if this is another "boy who cried wolf..." I will do my best to find some charge to lock you up all night! Come on! Let's go! Now, let's see. I'm not so good at operating this machine. Our deputy usually takes care of this stuff. But, I bet I can figure it out. Look, I make a living working these machines. Why don't you let me handle it? No! No! I got it! Now look, I got it on. Give me the tape. Please. Let me do it. Give me the tape! Alright, wiseguy. Where's the blood and guts, huh? It's there, just give it time. Well? I don't know. Maybe I didn't rewind it. Let me see. Dammit! You've got it on record! You're erasing it! Shit! I'm sorry! Turn it off! Let me stop it. Turn it off. Just, turn it off! I don't know what to say. Maybe you can repair it. Oh! Maybe I can repair it. But you've probably already erased it! Now you look here! Listen! I've put up with your bullshit! And I've indulged your fantasies! But I draw the line at your accusations! Now, you just take that tape, and you get the hell out of my sight! Thanks a lot. You've been a "great" help. I mean, if this were a big city, I'd swear the whole thing reeks of a conspiracy. But here in "Dog Patch"? I'm being made out to look like a paranoid idiot! Now, there is no doubt in my mind that I saw a tape of the real, live murder of a man identified as the post-master. And yet, you feel you talked to the post-master in Florida. I talked to him! Or, at least, I talked to someone who said he was the post-master. And who knew his social security number. You want a drink? No. No. You go ahead. And then someone in the store decides to drop off a second tape, depicting the murder of the only other person to see the first tape! And yet, when I talk to the victim's mother she swears he's in Boston. Bullshit. I saw him slammed up against the wall of my studio by the same guys who did in the post-master. And both efforts to show the damn tapes to our brilliant chief of police have backfired! Especially the second one, in an obviously all too planned "accident". Am I going crazy, or what? I don't know, honey. I don't know. Look, I want to believe you. But, you have to admit this all sounds so outrageous! God! I want a cigarette! Maybe I will have that drink. Alright. Now, why don't you just let me play detective for a minute, okay? Now this whole thing would be much easier to believe if we had a motive. Now, why would someone murder these two seemingly unrelated people? And then, why would they video-tape the murders? By doing that, they have just created a pretty fool-proof piece of evidence. And, why would they then arrange to have you - of all people - view them? And, now, according to you, the phones are bugged, the post-master is dead, and there's an impostor at his phone number... And Rick Carlson's mother - Well, she's either a fake or a patsy. I'm absolutely up against a wall. I mean, I refuse to think that my husband is off his rocker... But, Steve, if all the rest of this is true, then I'm getting pretty scared also. I may be losing my mind, but I'm gonna start my own little investigation tomorrow. Fine. I'm all for it. Where are you going to begin? I haven't the foggiest idea. Alright, well, you might as well wait here. We'll go in and get some directions, and something to drink. Just a soda for me. Thanks. What? A soda. Oh, wow, man. You got a lot of really good magazines here. Why, thank you, young man. Are you lost? We're just going tubing. The weather's for shit, and they're taking an hour in the store. Boy, you must really be thirsty! Oh, you better believe it. It's been such a long ride! Oh, yeah! I almost forgot. How do we get to the place that rents the canoes? Oh, I'll tell you. But, first, you might want to try some of my fresh lemonade. I just made it myself. Okay. Thanks. Here you go. Nice and cold. I think I'll... I'll take... ( Gagging ) Shit! We've been poisoned! ( Gagging ) You... You son of a bitch! Hello! ( Laughter ) Bye bye! Okay, Howard. Now go get the ones in the deli! Did I miss all the fun? No way! It's just begun! ( Carving knife whirring ) Soup's on! ( Splash ) ( Splatter ) Cut it clean! And then take it to the slicer and give me a half a pound of arm! ( Laughter ) ( Slicer running ) Enough of that work anyway. Man, am I tired. Not bad, not bad. Let's see what's on television. Nah, nothing! I know what I'll watch. I got another goodie from the store the other night. Let's see what this is all about. ( Yelling and laughing ) Yeah, lean on it! That's it. Oh! This is a good one! Those boys are getting better at this! Yeah, definitely. ( Footage ends ) Alright. That wasn't too bad. Hi! Hello! What can I get for you? Well, why don't I take a half a pound of the yellow American cheese, and a half a pound of bologna. Okay. Alright. Thanks. ( Slicer runs ) Well, let me see now. That'll be $3.90. Okay. Out of $4.00. Here's your change. Thank you. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Bye now. It had to have happened in the deli! There was a point when I went to get some milk, and I left my bag on the counter. It could've been the owner, or any of three or four people in the store. But how could they have known the exact time you were going to be there? I don't know! Maybe they followed me. Ho! Ho! This is getting pretty spooky. Well, however they did it, they obviously went to a lot of work. They obviously want us to watch this. Are you up to it? I really have no idea. Don't forget, I have yet to see one of these masterpieces. But, I guess I am rather curious. Go ahead. Okay. Here it goes. ( Music playing ) My god! That is gross! ( Tape is paused ) Now, that looked like a professional film! Did all the other ones have titles? No. No titles. No music. That doesn't look like a hollywood vampire movie, either. I mean, first off it was daylight. Secondly, you could see his reflection in the mirrors. And, obviously, somebody took time to edit it. Oh, my god! That poor girl! She looked genuinely surprised. I really think that they cut her! They must've lured her in telling her she was doing some kind of a movie and then never mentioned anything about it. God. Well, that definitely wasn't a hollywood epic. Just more of the same. Only, this time, they got a little more artsy-fartsy about it. But, you know, that looked very professionally done. Did you ever hear of it? "The Vampire Takes a Bride". No. You know, I have to tell you, the girl... She looks kind of familiar. I mean, like a member, or something. I think she comes in to - Well, used to - come in with her baby. Oh, my god! That is awful! Look! Wait a minute. I have an idea! What time is it? It's about 8:30. Didn't you tell me that the projectionist at your old movie theater in New York - Didn't you tell me he was a horror freak? Why don't you call New York? Get him on the phone and see if he's ever heard of it! I mean, it could be one of those low budget films shot for the home video market. Good idea. I'd like to talk to someone on the outside about this. It's a recording. All the outside circuits are busy. I'll call again in a minute. Wait a minute. That's exactly what happened when I tried to call Florida. Try the operator. Get her to try it. Okay. Yes, operator? Yes. I'm having a little trouble reaching a number in New York. Yes, it's a movie theater. The number's 212- 472- 4567. Thank you. She's dialing. Well, you're not gonna believe this. Well? What happened? Well, first off, it was a recording. Which is either something new, or something very suspicious. But, more important, it said that there was a special horror double feature tonight: "Night of the Living Dead, and The Vampire Takes a Bride". What? Oh, no. Wait a minute. This has got to be a gag! Yes, but what kind of a gag? And put on by who? And is the whole town in on it? What is it they're in on? No, wait a minute. Do you want to go outside the town? Do you want to go back to New York, or do you want to report this to the state police? I don't know. I keep trying to put myself in some place of authority. You know? Some guy ranting and raving about "video murders", and conspiracy, and the town of unfriendly people who all have VCRs. You gotta admit, it sounds pretty sketchy, and a little "off the wall". Well, it is getting me pretty nervous. Look, I'm calling in sick to work tomorrow. I'm gonna with you to the store, and I'm gonna go through all the membership files. I'm gonna try and see if something is amiss, or weird. Maybe if we talk about each member then something will jump out at us. I doubt it, honey. I've been through them all in my mind. Alright. Well, actually, I really don't care if that helps to solve anything or not. I don't want to be alone. And I don't want to be in that office with all those creepy people either. Look, maybe if we just stick together we can figure something. And, if not, we can just pick up, and leave. Okay. Alright. We'll see what happens tomorrow. Okay? Right now, why don't we get some sleep. Would you mind if we left the lights on? It's okay. Yeah. Here you go. See if I can find anything. You guys open? Sure. Come on in. And what can we do for you? Do you have any XXX films? Sure, a room full. Around back. Just behind the door. How much does that cost? Are you a member? My father is. 09. Well, then, providing you're over 18, it's $2.98 a tape. Just bring the box up. Do you know him? Huh? No. No, I... I don't think so. Honestly, this whole thing's got me so mixed up I really can't concentrate. Things driving me crazy. Hi! Hi. I'm Joanna Barker, I'm visiting my aunt and uncle for a short vacation, and I thought I'd like to rent a movie. They're club members, and I have their card. Oh, this one's good. 65. I know that. The Todds, right? That's my aunt and uncle! Is there anything in particular, or would you like to just browse? Yeah, you have any Laurel and Hardy, or Abbott and Costello? I was in the mood for a really old fashioned comedy. ( Sigh ) What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing. You just threw us, that's all. I mean, you're the first person in ages to ask for a comedy, rather than a slasher film! Okay. Here you go. Thanks. You probably haven't been around here long enough to realize it. But this town has a strange preoccupation with violence. I mean, we have a pretty good selection of dramas, comedies, "kid vid". But, the only thing we seem to rent are gory horror movies. And some occasional smut. I can't believe this. I thought I was crazy! What do you mean? Well, I made a few friends here last year. The big thing to do on Saturday night, is to make a bowl of popcorn and sit in front of the tube and watch people getting killed! And, another thing, they don't look like the kind of movies you see in the theaters or on TV. What exactly do you mean? I don't know. They look kind of "home-made". You know? I mean, no real plots or anything. Just a bunch of senseless killings! I myself don't get a big thrill out of that kind of thing! Well, that does sound pretty weird. Do you have one of these? I mean, I'd like to take a look at it. Maybe someone's making illegal dupes or something. No! Hey! Maybe I could borrow one from someone and bring it to you? Great. If you could, we would be very grateful. Okay. Why don't I bring it to you tomorrow when I bring back the film? Okay. Terrific. Good. So, do you have that comedy? Oh, sure. Oh! We wont even charge you for it. I mean, after all, you're doing us a favor, right? Here you go. Thanks. Thanks! Bye! Bye. Do you believe it? Someone halfway normal who thinks this preoccupation with dripping guts is abnormal. ( Screaming ) Help! Somebody! Help me, please! You lock up. I'll start the car. ( Jeep drives off ) ( Car starts ) Steve! These guys are the ones on the video! They're the murderers! What do you think you're going to do to stop them? I don't know. We can't count on the police, that's for sure. I mean, they didn't do anything before. I mean, we can't let them take her! You know what's gonna happen to her! We'll just follow them for a little bit, and maybe we can do something. Alright, well you just be careful and don't stay so close. Don't worry. Don't worry. I don't want to get involved with this just as much as you don't. Where are they going? I don't know. This place doesn't even look familiar. She looks like she's tied up. Shit. This is none of your concern! Look! The cellar door is open. Don't you dare go down there! Let me call the police. Great. A hell of a lot of good that'll do! It'll take that chief four hours to waddle over here! Look! Don't try to be a hero! Did you see that big guy? He had a knife! Yeah. And that poor girl is our only link to sanity. Look! Will you please just let me go get some help? I'm sorry, Rachel. This is something I'm just going to have to do! I want to find out once and for all what's going on down there! Why don't you just wait up here? No way! Alright, let's get this over with! Right. You stay behind me. Rachel! Steve! Welcome! Hey, don't be shy! Come on in! We have been absolutely breathless with anticipation. Now haven't we, friends and neighbors? ALL: Yes! I guess you're wondering why we've brought you here. Huh? Well, today is the age of "video violence", right? I mean, being from New York, I'm sure that you're aware that people have been making and swapping homemade porno movies for years! Well, you see, we like to make our own brand of down-home snuff movies. ( Laughing ) Of course, casting these things is a bit difficult. You can never use the same actor twice! ( Laughter ) And if we used ourselves, it, of course, would cut down on the size of our audience. So, we use transients. People passing through. Or, people who want to leave. Like our post-master, Reggie Hobbs! ( Everyone agreeing ) Now, see, he wanted to go to Florida! We couldn't let him do that! Oh! Or that hitchhiker that Eli picked up. Well, once you've been picked up by Eli you're history. ( Laughter ) Oh! Or that gal in the vampire movie. Now, she wanted to go to Hollywood and have a movie career. She knew our secret! So, she had to die for her art. ( Laughter ) But, they are all immortalized on tape. And I am proud, PROUD to say, that we have here the greatest collection of video gore anywhere in the world! One that no special effects man could possibly create! And that's because it's real! You're all insane. No! Just ahead of our time. I'm really sorry that you and Rachel wont be able to stay on and run the shop. But, you see, we feel we need a place where we can rent our tapes, and meet, and we need a special kind of manager for that. But, I want to assure you, that your tape is going to be a number one renter for a very long, long, time. ( Laughter ) ( Demonic laughter ) ( Scream ) ( Scream ) Hey, quiet! Shh! Shh! Lights! Camera! Rolling! Action! ( Chainsaw runs ) Hey, Mitch. Hey! Ho! Alright. What do you got there, kiddo? Hey. Okay. Jack Gravel. I have him... Somebody just had him. Alright. Here we go. Okay. Here you go. Hey, did you see what we got on the TV over there? That's a very popular one! Yeah, I'll take this one home tonight. "Jenny Bailey". Oh, do you remember her at all? What? Get out of here! I'll bite your neck! Oh, I'd love it, darling! You watch out! I'll bite your neck! Okay. There you go. Oh. Good. Is it a good one? They're all good, hon. We don't have any bad ones! I'll bite your neck! ( Laughter ) Get out of here! Hey! Wait! Wait! Did you see what we have on the tube over there? Special! Go take a look. ( Music playing )
