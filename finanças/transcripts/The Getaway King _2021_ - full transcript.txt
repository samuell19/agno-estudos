This story was inspired by the life of Zdzisław Najmrodzki, a thief that escaped the authorities a record 29 times. POLAND, 1988 The shops are empty. People crave commodities. Toilet paper is a luxury product. Western goods are sold exclusively in PEWEX shops for American dollars. The state is barely holding on. But one man thrives... I need an assistant for my gig in Cuba. We'll hire you as an assistant, but you need to buy yourself a passport. Zdzisław Najmrodzki is on the run. The Warsaw Militia announced a reward for anyone who comes forward and reveals his whereabouts. A stunning two million zloty. Najmro! Bravo! The king of the underground is known for his numerous robberies and escapes. How much was it before? In other news... Just one and a half. MILITIA I have an idea. Two million for your head, right? So... We make a pact and turn you in. They throw you in the slammer, we get the money, you do the getaway. Everyone is happy. When they put up as much for you, we'll share in. Okay. Sit! Sit! -Why are you just standing here? -We're waiting for you, lieutenant. Still a stranger in the city. Robbery. Front entry. Or back entry... So which was it? Do you know anything about life? "THE CURSE OF THE SNAKE VALLEY" It just came out. Was there an alarm? Listen, I was thinking... Maybe it's time I got a bigger share of the sales? Demand creates supply. Sell more. -Who sells better than me? I know. -Yeah, I know. -There are four kinds of customers. -Not one more. Till next time. Your loss. CINEMA Where's Elly? Fired. You don't say. Get me a few posters, sis. No. You gotta earn it. One ticket, please. And the posters? After the screening. -When does it start? -It doesn't. -But I paid for it. -Ten viewers minimum. Seriously? -Man of business? -Man of luck. -Are you sure? -I'm very lucky. You sure you wanna watch it? We have a screening! -What? -Nothing. TEMPORARY ARREST WARRANT That's all? We don't have a complete file. He's active all around the country. Get me everything. I'm gonna have to call every precinct! Head precincts, district, state. And make a list of all PEWEX stores without alarms. Why the fancy outfit? Going to church? Dinner with the wife. -She hasn't seen me for a week. -Anybody wanna look at you for a week? Made it myself. I'll get you back one day. Still want those posters? Interested? In such a hurry to get rid of me? Bye. -Calamity. -Gotta go by foot. I see you've got wheels, sis. Aren't you scared to walk around? -That I'd be robbed? -That you'd be snitched. -Feel free to snitch. There's a reward... -I'm not a squealer. You getting on? A 250 with a Mikuni pump. You've got taste, sis. -You've got taste for talking. -You know my name, sis. Friendship demands parity. -Theresa. -Such a beautiful name. -Seriously? -Let's go on a date, sis. Get off. Are you okay? A date? Why the charade? What do you say? I don't say no. I don't say yes. It is 8 pm. Mature audiences only. MILITIA Here you are. In the past few weeks, media all over the country reported the shocking news of a series of robberies of PEWEX Internal Export Company shops. The attacks were carried out by the infamous Zdzisław Najmrodzki. Let us recall the wrongdoings of the infamous Getaway King. WANTED REWARD RE-ENACTMENT Would the accused like to say anything before the sentencing hearing begins? -Yes, Your Honor. -Go ahead. My mother taught me to be polite, so I'd like to say goodbye. -Get him! -Stop right now! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! I fixed the door. Here's one lock. And a second one here. Good ones. My own expense. That's all I can do. Still expect to be robbed, like everybody else. Lieutenant, if you say a word, your superiors could get us an alarm. That is my job. We policemen don't like it either. And policewomen. A female officer is still a rare sight. True. True. But our fatherland is improving. Right. Hande hoch! Hands up! Pants down! -Your pic is peeled off. -Indeed. They have it? Hunky-dory. Bye! Almost there! You look nice. He's not wrong. -Bye. -Bye, honey. -They have it? -They don't. Honky donky! Rififi. Is that him? It's him. It's him! Maestro, blame it on the other one. Do the paperwork and lock him up. Are you alright? Well done, officer! Fresh on the job, and he's already an old hand. Dismiss. Name and surname. Everyone knows me. Name and surname! Why so angry? Anger hurts beauty. Name and surname! The lieutenant is quite brash. Hitting, yanking. Not that I mind. But you, Sarge? -You should. -Shut up. -Aren't you angry? -Shut up. Man with a past. -That's why he's so gloomy. -Shut up. I'll make some coffee. Names and surnames of partners in crime. What crime? No one was hurt. Stores are empty. People have nothing. If the state can't provide, I have to. A true good man. Names and surnames of partners in crime. You're ungrateful, lieutenant. I lent you a helping hand. Saved your life. Thieves like you used to have their hands cut off. -Why did we change that? -I get it. You're new here. Still learning the ropes. Nobody likes you. Small town guy. I'm very sorry, lieutenant, sir. You started the brawl, so I need to end it. But I cannot stress enough that I don't like this one bit. Tag. Hey! Wake up! What the fuck, sonny? What's with the costume? Change of trade? When you see trouble, you run to Mommy. You're good at something, you attract attention. If you attract attention, you're not good enough. Get your own house. You won't get hit so much. How's Mom been? Hello! I'm old and lonely. What could I do? He fell in love. Love is the essence of life. Hi there. Private property? The ruling classes were overthrown. It's social. Someone's on foot, though. -Need a lift? -No need. -I'm trying to make an impression... -To no avail. One ride. One. Anywhere you like. They say you're dangerous. Just dangerously handsome. Hug me! -Home? -You said anywhere I like. -You want to say something? -No time to talk. What should we do? We should kiss. Barb! Be quiet, get ahead. Take me, for example. No agency, no post office, no police... know where I live. You troublemakers, punks, pricks! You snooze... you lose. -There's a mother. -It's common. He did a store as a minor. She got probation. It's the only note about her. Kicked the bucket? What if she's alive? Find her. Head precinct speaking. We're looking for a woman. Bye. You took your pills? I have a heart condition, not dementia. Are you a smart man? I'd like my daughter to date a man of intellect. I'm not dating anybody! I'm too modest to say no. How would you deal with this? This might be interesting. My guest in the studio today is Lieutenant Wróbel. Do you feel that the Najmrodzki case has ridiculed the national police? I want to stress that this is not a fair statement. The Najmrodzki case... I'd like to watch. Dad? -Fake news. -Exactly. When I was your age, cops almost beat the life out of me. I was in hospital for a week. Don't stay up late. And yet, you must admit that this audacious criminal has shown, more than once, that he is playing with the police. I object to that. This is not true at all. Bad guys are getting smarter. And that makes our job much harder. But surely society expects you to act... It doesn't help us at all that people support him. For us, as police officers, this is completely unacceptable. We have our best men chasing him. They are closing in on him as we speak. How do you see this playing out? I don't want to be a TV girl. I'll figure something out. Don't worry. Pinkie promise? Otherwise, it's not happening. Now what? We could talk. -Now's not the time for talking. -It's not? Thank you for watching. Tune in for the next episode. Okay. I'll call you back. -Sergeant Ujma. -We found her address. -Got a pen? -Yes. I'll dictate. Would you allow your future wife to make some changes, if she desired to make some? I don't know, my lady. Great love means even greater sacrifices. And you, for instance, what would you sacrifice for a great feeling? It seems you don't believe in the power of my feelings. And yet the one... I will love... Fuck! ...will be able to appreciate that. -How to succeed in sales? -By bribes. How to succeed in sales legally. -Are we going into sales now? -We're not. What? -Get a customer. -What type of customer? -Dumb one. -Blind one. Mass customer. Everyone wants it. Few can get it. So we take it from owners and pass it to buyers. Fair. Square. Lucrative. A store is a store. Nobody got robbed. A car has an owner. People won't like this. If they could afford one, they can another. I'm a thief, not a salesman. When do we start? Loeoncio! Shut up, Leoncio! Hey! Hello! Hey! You're listening to "Vacations in the Countryside." Break time! How to hook a customer? Use psychology. To be successful, you need to know the customer. There are four kinds of customers. Not one more. The Professor. May I look up the skirt? Thinks he knows everything. Treat him professionally. It's 1.5. SCe, 64 kW. It was supposed to be 140. They were too unreliable. Fenders, mostly. A little upgrade. Powder-coated frames. MR 86, a coupe front belt, but with Citroen-level performance. -Or Talbot Horizon. -Or Simca 1307. -Or Lada Samara. -Not even the same league. Kadett D-E. Better rotation. The Sucker. -Those have lower mileage. -This one is red. Makes no decisions on his own. None at all. But he pretends he does. Could we get a discount? -We'll take it. -Honey... No one in the office has the red one. -Why does it matter? -It's crucial. -How much? -I have three buyers, but ladies first. The Negotiator. Lady, you asleep? Maybe I am, maybe I'm not. He negotiates. Goes down. Or up. He's in it for the show. -Two and a half. -Three. -Two point nine. -Two point nine but with old tires. -You gonna change rubber? -Maybe I will, maybe I won't. -I get two Bambinos for that much. -Used ones. Two point eight. With new tires? And the fourth one? The Justin. The Justin? The Justin. Need help? I'm just in... Oh, God! The Third Kuman! The Third Kuman! It's heading for the manuscript. How's Dad? Oh, I see. Should I strip? -Game time? -The crew awaits. -Is there gonna be any dancing? -Most likely. I don't want to impose. Who says you are? Nice and dandy between us? Nice? And very dandy. We could try it for real. You and me. You'd just need to keep a low profile. Tag. Was it a clairvoyant? Or a stroke of genius? First-class militia work. -Gonna flee anyway. -We'll get you. What a dreary life. No time to sit still, catch a break. Always gotta run to be free. One gets rusty with no exercise. Old lady sings. Move, move. Get in. Right. Old lady sings. Hunting season is off. The eyes are open. When's the flight? The bunk. The salvo. That's all. Screws will get suspicious. Screws? How's the band? The gang. They all say hi. Anything else the... ...old lady should know? To teach you the lingo, you sap. The eyes are open. Get rid of old tiles, put in new ones, repaint ceilings and windows... Zalevski, Tomchak! Back to the classroom! Replace the little sinks and repaint everything in here. Can you do it? In two months? You can, I know you can. Because a deadline extension is out of the question. Stop! Get back here! Stop right there! Get here now! How did Marx and Engels smoke? You know? Marx with no filter. Engels not at all. -What's the rush? -You like it fast. -It's me they're after. -Then I'm next. You're not. And I'll be off the hook soon. We'll settle down. -I've got a plan. -What plan? -The less you know, the better. -See no evil, hear no evil. -You know that's not what I mean. -Do I? They'll let me go when I leave the stage. One last job. -And then? -Whatever you want. -A country house. -Kids? -Fine by me. -You'll have them yourself? Serious. -You're not gonna make it. -Wanna bet? Uptown girl? "Thanks for the hospitality." "The food was poor. Say hi to Lieutenant Barski. Regards, Zdzislav." He left the note on his bed. Very nice. Escaped through The October Revolution School. Revolution! He's shoving it in our faces. Get lost, morons. No more games. You find him, you shoot him. Shoot to kill? Shoot to kill. We need no martyrs. We need no pain in the socialist ass either. Is that clear? Last dance. Did you tell them? Do it, or they'll be pissed. The sooner the better. You don't need any more trouble. What do you mean "last dance"? This is our last dance. We'll sell these and we're done. -The broad made you nuts. -Watch your mouth. Walk down the street, girl. We do the dirty work for you, Get you out of the cooler and you shut us down? -What did I tell you in the beginning? -Very beginning? That the crew is what matters the most. Right. That's why no one leaves empty-handed. Only a pussy leaves the gang. What are you talking about? Listen to the engine! You're selling crap, boy. Kiss my ass. You'll get a discount. Who's selling this? Teamwork. We okay? Okay. Dipping is a good man's work. I got what... ...you lost. Do you know why my head is pricy? And yours isn't? I can see far beyond your sight. I know this kind of stuff won't get us very far. We're just not good enough for you. I'd like to play, too. I'm right fucking here! Barski. -Who's speaking? -I am. You're looking for someone. I know where he is. -Hi. -Hi. -One with ketchup and two without. -One hot dog please. What the hell. Fuck. Hey, you! -That was the order! -In public? First-class police work. Oh, no. A very nice clairvoyant this time called us. Someone doesn't like you. -Ten years. Well done. -I'll figure something out. And then what? You said you'd be off the hook. I was snitched, it wasn't my fault. You are so good, they are so bad. If you say so. If you leave your way, go on your way. -You leave as a free man, I'll wait. -Ten years? You'll behave, help out, work, study... Whatever. Very well then. Theresa! Theresa! I'll be good. I'll behave and all. And they'll let you out early. They always do if you behave. And I'll be there. I'll wait. Many shops have special discounts. Others prepared thousands of packages for their new customers. For the first time since the border opened, there has been an incident at the Brandenburg Gate in West Berlin. Hundreds of young people with hammers, hooks and chisels disconnected a part of the wall, which was then towed away, creating a break in the structure. The West Berlin police had to intervene. Lend me a hand, will you? Word is we have a new captain. Not a captain. A commissioner. -And certainly we do. -Yeah. Wonder whose ass he's up. New times. New people. I achieved everything I did thanks to honest hard work and my family. I'm running for congress because my kids deserve a better future. Integrity. Welfare. Prosperity. ALL FOR FAMILY Vote for our daddy! GETAWAY KING SUCCESSFULLY REHABILITATED Today's crimes in Warsaw include 11 burglaries, five robberies, and two beatings. There were 18 people killed. My compliments. Let's talk for real. Like an officer and his subordinate. -We have anything to talk about? -We don't. And we won't. Ever. I stand before you as the first Polish president elected directly by the people. This moment marks the beginning of the Third Polish Republic. The arrest of the head of the Pruszków mob set off an internal power play. A bomb was planted earlier this year... You don't like me. I don't like you. Why bother? After all we've been through? Especially after that! Especially! He was supposed to be shot! But he was not. That's insubordination. As the new commissioner I've no need for rebels like you. I know how to get out. It's not what you think. I mean, as a free man. Like I promised. Before the due date? "I never thought I'd become a thief." "We used to live in a harsh reality created by the previous government." "You know all about it. You brought it down." "The system was making people slaves." "That's why it fell apart. Thanks to you." "That is why I put forward my humble request..." And so on, and so on. What do you think? -Who is it for? -The president. Good morning. What have you done? You used to be such a pretty boy. You know who I work for? I suppose. My boss is worried for the safety of your shop. That is why... we offer security services. Don't thank us. We're happy to be at service. For a price... we get... that. Uptown girl is still around. Your buddies know you're a snitch? You need to get out. Sooner. You're in here for her, so get out for her. He won't pardon you. You're not a big fish anymore. The world has changed. Exactly. That's why he'll pardon me. I fought the old world, not the new one. -What should we do then? -You need to vanish. Hush. -Wife at home? -Don't have a wife. Do you want one? Why the visit? My boy says hello and asks you to pay back the debt. Paid it when he wasn't shot. Then we'd like another loan. I'm no longer a cop. Even better. Why can't you people calm down and keep you heads down? You were a decent cop. Help us. He did pardon you finally. -There he is! -That's him! My client is innocent. That was not a pyramid scheme but... an oscillator. Thank you very much. Maestro... What now? We could talk. Not a time to talk. He's not on his own. Get out! You've grown. You've grown old. Stay calm. Easy does it. Here's an idea. I don't kill you, you leave us alone. Capiche? I can't hear you! You don't kill me, I leave you alone. Or maybe I won't? Go ahead. Kill me. Three... two... one. If I won't get you, my gang will shred you to pieces. The body burned to the ground. The explosion ripped the hand off. We checked the fingerprints. He pulled some numbers on you, but he can't beat science. It's the end of an era, one could say. ZDZISLAV NAJMRODZKI BELOVED SON, DIED AT 41 Zdzislav Najmrodzki, the once-famous criminal, is dead. The police confirm this shocking news. He was called the Getaway King, beloved by the public for his numerous daring escapes. Grilled. I mean, the body was completely burned. Currently we have one hypothesis. He was in pursuit. Or on the run. Please. Commissaire, is it him for sure? My condolences. Sonny. Check and mate. Why the grin? Why the nerves? Anger hurts beauty. A promise is a promise. Free road ahead. -Whatever we want. A country house... -You read my mind, sis. Not what you want? Let's talk. It's no time for talking. It's not? After work, I like to... Oh, I love movies. Some kind of action movies, and, of course, love. Love is a must.
