[soft music] [jungle animal cries] Told you I'd find it. But not if they found it first. I doubt it. It looks to me like that crocodile won't have to feed for a while. [laughs] [mysterious music] And to think you, and everyone, doubted me. I don't even know why I let you come, Brother… [grunts] I'm sure you'll think of a reason. [intriguing music] [grunts] The Hamster of Darkness. Finally. When I bring this back to the kingdom, nobody's going to be laughing at my ear anymore. No, I'm going to be the one who's laughing… not at my ear of course. But because I was right, that the hamster is real. [grunting] Something does not feel right. Oh hush, let me enjoy this glorious moment. [triumphant laughter] -[sinister laughter] -Huh? [grunting] Twenty years ago my father and his brother Lapin almost found the greatest artifact in the world. I'm sorry, Lapin. -This isn't happening. -[baby crying] -What the…? -Over there. But they found something else… [cooing] Me. What is it? The freak's pointing at my ear! No, he's not. He did it again! Nonsense. He's adorable. Hi there, little guy. You're not taking him back with us? I'm not leaving him. Good thing I'm the older brother and will be king someday, because you're too soft! Way too soft! My uncle never found the Hamster of Darkness. And he was never named king. But we'll get to that soon enough… [adventurous music] From the moment my dad brought me home, I was preparing for the day when I would become a great adventurer like him. [cooing] -[laughing] -There you go. Ow, ow! Nice slap of the wrist. -[crying] -No, no! Hm? Ah? What do you think? [joyful music] My favorite days were the days when my dad returned from an adventure… I don't see what the big deal is… I mean, they just found old junk. I find old junk in alleys and nobody's throwing me a parade. That's my turtle servant Abe. He's a "glass-is-all-empty" kind of guy. -Dad! -Hi there, little guy. Did you find the fork from the last brunch? And the knife! But I couldn't find the spoon! Of course, I found the spoon! [laughs] When I saw how everyone looked up to adventurers like my dad, there and then I decided that's how I wanted them to see me. And so there I was, 200 feet above hare-eating crocodiles, hanging from a cliff. -And then what happened? -And then… you went to bed. -[sighs] -[chuckles] Hey, that's why they call it a cliffhanger, pal. Good night, my future royal adventurer. [soft music] I was obsessed with adventuring. I stayed up every night reading. [grunting] Stupid feathers… [cheerful music] I devoured every book about adventuring and spent hours in the royal library… I could not get enough of it. I knew the day would come. Ah! I don't think heavy lifting is in my job description. The tryouts, let's go, Abe. [soft panting] [crowd cheering] Every year I watched the Royal Adventure Society tryouts, determined to pick up tips for when it was my turn. [giggles] Why'd you invite him to sit with us? My dad made me 'cause his dad's the new king. Why we gotta be seen with that freak Chickenhare? It could be worse. We could be Chickenhare. [laugh] -Right? -Oh man. [crowd continues cheering] [breathing heavily] [crying] [somber music] [intriguing music] [distant laughter] That was a lot of fun. What a crock, the competitors are getting better and better every year. -Some world classic… -Chickenhare? What are you wearing? [nervous laughter] Like it? It's very in. It's very now… now. Boots that make you look like you have hare feet are very now… now? Style's changed a lot since you were a kid, Dad. Come on, let's take that hat off so I can… No! Everybody laughs at me, Dad. I know it's hard being different. No, you don't know. Nobody knows what it's like to be me. Chickenhare, now what have I always told you? The things that make us different… Are what make us special. Yeah, I know, Dad. But I don't wanna be special. I just wanna be normal. And wearing this, I feel normal. Maybe I'm not as up on the fashion trends as I used to be. [chuckles] It's not just you, Dad! It's all old people. Oh! And check out what I can do in my new boots. [groaning] Ow! I'm okay. All good… Little sore, but good. It's just a phase. He'll grow out of it. [soft music] [crowd cheering] [intriguing music] [crows] This is it, Abe. Moment of truth. The day all my dreams come true. Remember my three keys to success? Don't. Screw. Up. In accordance with the laws in the Royal Rulebook, those applicants today who reach the finish line shall be considered for the Royal Adventure Society for life. First up, Chickenhare. [crowd cheers] [mocking laughter] This should be interesting! Come on! -[both laugh] -[groans] [exasperated] That's just slowing me down. What are you doing? [grunting] [crowd shouting] Ouch, that hurts. [groans] [nervous laughter] Just getting my bearings. Time to make up some ground. [intriguing music] [grunting] Here we go. -[crowd laughs] -No! -Ah! -[crowd screams] I'm okay, I'm okay. Just go on. Sorry! [Chickenhare screaming] [groans] Yes! Hey, that's cheating! [triumphant laughter] [gasps] Come on. You're almost there. All you have to do is get across the Really-Really-Deep- But-Not-Quite-Bottomless-Pit. Careful, Son. I can't watch, but I can't look away. [drumming] Easy. -Come here. -Let it go! [crowd screams] No, no! [screaming] [croaks] [sighs] [groans] -Well, there's always a plan B. -I don't have a plan B. You could become a stamp collector. It's like an adventure every time the mail comes. And the mail comes every day. That's a lot of adventures. Ah, what's so great about being a royal adventurer anyway? Besides the fame and adulation? Hey, Chickenhare, nice work today! -Nothing but net! -[laughs] Yeah! Hey, what'd you expect? He's mostly chicken. Pfft. No, he's mostly hare. -Chicken! -Hare! -Chicken! -Hare! You know, if you close your eyes and take it out of context, it sounds like they're cheering for you. Chicken! Hare! Chicken! Hare! Chicken! Hare! Chicken… [somber music] [sighs] Why can't I be like everyone else? Chickenhare? Geez, Dad, think you could knock? Sorry. Thought you'd wanna talk about what happened today. Oh, that. [nervous chuckling] Just a minor setback is all. Next year, I'm gonna focus on doing more cardio. Maybe some altitude training. You do know you can't audition twice. I figured since you're the King, you could make an exception. I can't break the rules just because you're my son. Come on, Dad. All I need is one more shot. I could crush it… You need to put your energies elsewhere. I know it's difficult to let go of your dream. I… I just don't want to see you get hurt again. Is this because I embarrassed you? Oh, Chickenhare. You could never embarrass me. When I look at you, I wish you could see what I see. Yeah, wish I could too. All I see is that I got the worst parts of a hare and a chicken. Maybe you got the best parts. Do you know the greatest treasure I ever found? The Fountain of Middle Age? It was you. Finding you when Uncle Lapin and I went searching for the Hamster of Darkness was the best thing that ever happened to me. Goodnight, Son. -[crows] -Oh, shut up! I've studied adventuring more than anybody, right? So, I've just gotta figure out the location of the one treasure that every adventurer has been searching for, but has never found… -Woah! -And when I figure that out, he'll have to let me into the Royal Adventurer Society. [Abe panting] What's the treasure? Come on, you know what I'm talking about. The greatest undiscovered treasure of all time… Gotcha. The greatest undiscovered treasure of all time. I have no idea. Arturo the Rodent King created it to take over the world. Doesn't ring a bell. Then his brother Ramon stole it and hid it before Arturo could use it. [annoyed groan] It has the power of a million hamsters! Oh! Nope, still don't have it. It rhymes with the "Damster of Harkness"… Shh! [liturgical choir] The Hamster of Darkness, Abe! How could you not get that? From where I'm sitting, it was a problem with the clues. According to the old legends, "At the hour of 9 on a new day's dawn, the constellation of the hamster shall point to The Temple of the Hamster of Darkness." Well, it's almost 9 which means I'm about to make time-and-a-half. Cha-ching! There's one problem. You can't see a constellation at 9 in the morning. It's too bright out. -We gotta be missing something. -Yeah, breakfast. -I'm starving! -I need the original text. [upbeat music] [humming] Erik the Literal's Volume 13 on the Hamster of Darkness is checked out. When's it due back? Three months ago. Fine, I'll go get it myself. So, who's got it? Your Uncle Lapin. [gasps] [thundering] So, uh, how long has it been since you've seen your uncle? Not since he tried to overthrow my father. He wasn't happy that my grandfather chose my dad as king and not him. Talk about rich people's problems. Ah, let's go. Time has mellowed him. Oh no. My duties as your turtleservant do not extend to accompanying you to meet with your terrifying uncle in his jail cell. [muttering] Nothing about meeting with evil uncles in jail… See, this is why you join a union. Servants-and-Bed-Pan-Handlers Local 645. Strength through numbers. [intriguing music] [snoring] -What's he in for? -Murder. Tax evasion. Ha! I murdered the tax code. [laughs] The prison that can hold Barry Goldfarb hasn't been built! Some rules to remember: Do not pass Lapin anything as he will turn it into a weapon, even a carrot. Don't approach the cell. Don't touch the bars. And don't reach through the bars. The last guy to do that spent a month in the hospital. Granted that was for the flu. But I'm sure he caught it from Lapin. Huh? You're not coming with me? The union says I don't have to. Thank goodness for Prison-Guards-and-Haberdashers Local 646. Strength through numbers. [screams] Nephew? What a pleasant surprise. Hi, Uncle Lapin. I was in the neighborhood and, uh, thought it might be nice to stop by and say "hi". So, um… Hi! And oh yeah, there's this book that you got from the library. It's actually long overdue. Oh no. What are they gonna do, lock me up? -[evil laughter] -[nervous laughter] Right. That's funny because you're already locked up for trying to overthrow my father. Well, I always did have a problem with authority. So, you're looking for the Hamster of Darkness, are you? Oh, no, no. I don't think it's real. Really? Every time I've requested a book on adventuring and it wasn't in, it was because you had checked it out. Somebody's been doing their homework. It's real. And we both know it. It'd be quite a feather in your cap to bring back to the Royal Adventure Society, wouldn't it? -Maybe… -[sighs] Such a waste. You see, when I find the Hamster of Darkness, I'm going to use it to take over the kingdom. [evil laughter] I'm just joking. Besides, I'm locked in this tower that no one has ever escaped from. You think I've been waiting for your visit because you were the final piece of my escape? [evil laughter] I wish I was that cunning. But now… let me find that book for you. Is this the one? Oh yeah, that's the one. So, uh, if you'd just toss it on over here, I'll get out of your way and you can go back to marking the days on the wall with chalk. I'm afraid my time in here has weakened me. Come over here. Why not just give it a little toss? Huh? On second thought, I… I'll come get it. Oops. [grunting] Hold on. I just remembered… I'm not done with it. [crashing] Goodbye, Chickenhare. Don't forget your hat. [breathing heavily] [suspenseful music] [thundering] Oh no… "Dear Brother, enjoy your last days as king. All the best, Lapin." I'm sorry, Dad. You know you're not allowed to visit Lapin! What were you thinking? He had this book I needed about the Hamster of Darkness. -See I figured… -I told you to let it go. Sir, it's a map! "The Tomb of the Unknown Turtle"? The old adventurer Frederic the Extremely Short proposed that as one of the locations of the Hamster of Darkness. That's where Lapin's going. Ready my boat. We leave immediately. Dad, I know everything about the Hamster of Darkness. Bring me, I can help. No. You've done enough already. [somber music] [door closes] [sighs] Hey, Boss, just came by to see how you're doing. Other than letting the most dangerous criminal escape. -I'm doing great. -You are? -Look what was behind the books. -An abstract painting? A map, Abe. Oh. Lapin's obsessed with the Hamster of Darkness. It doesn't make sense that he'd think the Temple would be at the Tomb of the Unknown Turtle. That's been searched many times. [bell rings] It's a minute before 9, something's missing. The moths are gonna be the only ones to miss Lapin. It's winter. There are no moths. [gasps] It's the constellation! Coincidence. It's not, Abe. Lapin has been on this quest for years. It's not a blanket, it's a curtain, give me that. [bell rings] You see, total coincidence. I'm not so sure. Let me clear the floor. Yes, that's it! The book. "At the hour of 9 on a new day's dawn, the constellation shall point to The Temple of the Hamster of Darkness." [enchanting music] Bingo. Where's the "X"? Don't maps need an "X" to mark the spot? Oh, darn tropes. [panting] Dad! Wait! You're going the wrong way! We need to get a boat ready. We have to beat Lapin to the Hamster of Darkness. Oh no, forget about it. I am not an adventurer. And you're… How do I put this delicately? You're… you. Maybe I'm not much of an adventurer, but we're the only ones who can do this now. And if we don't, Lapin's gonna come back and take over the kingdom. Well, unemployment is kinda high. And your dad's been king for what? 15 years? This is serious, Abe. And it's all my fault. Not all. Only like 90%. I'm going. And I want you to come with me. I'm your servant. I'm legally bound to go with you. No. I'm not asking as your master. I'm asking you as a friend. Well, that makes it an easy decision. [chuckles] Actually, that makes it an incredibly difficult decision. Can you be friends with your boss? Isn't the relationship completely skewed by the power dynamic? What? These are deep questions. I, for one, find them intellectually invigorating. Wait, wait. Actually, sorry, keep going. Wait. [sighs] I'm coming… friend. But be prepared for a lot of "I told you so's." [intriguing music] I have been at sea for 12 long minutes. The heat is unbearable. Thirst is a constant companion. And as for hunger, I may be developing a taste for chicken and hare. Not too late to turn around. I always wanted an adventure. I just hope we can pull it off. I'm sure we will. [nervous laughter] I have no confidence in our chances. If you're reading this, I've either been crushed, impaled, pole-axed, harpooned, eaten alive by carnivorous beetles, drowned in a sea full of sharks, killed by birds pecking at my every being. [buzzing] [gasping for air] So, so parched. Ow! Water? Oh, that goes down nice. Oh yeah. So, parched. That jet stream gets me every time. Well? Huh? Oh, yeah uh… The King took the bait. All's going like we planned. Like we planned? Well, yeah, okay. Technically it was your plan, but I agreed it was a great plan. -[nervous laughter] -No, it's the perfect plan. Well, not quite perfect. -What? -Uh… it's your nephew. The freak? He knows where the hamster is. And he and his little turtle friend are following us. Hey, I figured we could wait for them, then flank them and engage them in a nautical battle. [laughs] I've always wanted to be in a nautical battle. Please remember you're here because of your wings, not your brain. I can't waste valuable time on the off chance that the freak actually makes it across the ocean. No, we'll subcontract this one out. And I have just the animal for the job. Luther, the last member of our team. The most ruthless animal I've ever had the pleasure of working with. He's so mean, he once killed an animal just for snoring. Oh! [nervous laughter] I, um… I have sleep apnea. And it's… It's pretty bad. Can we get separate rooms? -Lapin, it's been too long. -[baby crying] [chuckles] It's okay, little guy… Coo coo coo! [exotic music] This is where Alexander the Sweaty discovered the Mustache of Destiny. Isn't this place great? Yeah. Great place to get murdered. Why are we here anyway? Follow me. This very tavern is where Hector the Lost hired the legless sherpa who led him to the Atheist's Temple. I never thought I'd see it with my own eyes. I think you and I have very different bucket lists. With any luck, this is where we'll find our guide. Or at least a communicable disease. Hey. You need a guide? I'm your gal. I know that jungle like the back of my tail. Don't do it, kid. She's bad news. Only a fool without a snout would hire a skunk. The guy you want's over there. Uh, excuse me? I'm looking for a guide. Well, fellow hare, you've come to the right rat. The name's Rusty, but my sense of direction's not. Come on, let's go talk in the back, away from prying ears. Yup. I think we can totally trust this guy. Not suspicious at all. -So Rusty, we gotta go to… -I already know where you're going. You do? Wow. No wonder you're a guide. You're going with him. -[laughs] -[snarls] [nervous laughter] He's joking, right? [laughs] Tell me we've stumbled into a very messed-up daycare. Uh… Rusty? Is this guide humor? You didn't tell me this guy was looking for the Hamster of Darkness. You lose your manners along with that eye? Stay out of this, skunk! Yeah, it's me, I'm Meg by the way. I don't care. Now give me that map. Over our dead bodies. So, Mr. Gorilla, just to be clear, Meg was speaking metaphorically about dead bodies. Uh-oh, he's a literalist. [Meg laughs] [mariachi music] Take this! -Yeah, my kind of girl! -[Luther grunting] We're in a bar fight! -Woah! -[laughs] [grunting] Our map! He's getting away. -Or not. [grunts] -[laughs] [Meg] Yeah, come on, is that all you got? [grunts] -[laughs] -Meg, you're amazing. I assume you're not going with Rusty as your guide because of the whole betrayal thing. You're hired! This should be a lesson, don't judge a book by its cover, 'cause you might end up reading a really bad book. [gasping] [growls] Uh… I'm really, really sorry. Meg? We've got a problem… And I've got the solution. Guys, put these on. Now. [suspenseful music] [all] Ah! [disgusted shrieking] What a blast! I'm gonna keep this if that's okay. [giggling] Oh darn, I need to change your diaper. [mysterious music] Hold up. This sweat is chaffing me like there's no tomorrow… Which there probably isn't. Ah… That's better. A little hot in that jacket? Not at all. [nervous chuckle] I'm actually a little cold. Okay… So, I know we haven't talked compensation, but I have a proposal. I'll take you to wherever you wanna go for free. What's the catch? I've been on a number of adventures myself, exclusively solo expeditions 'cause of the skunk thing. And the truth is, it's been kind of lonely. Meg, you can stay with us as long as you like. -Really? -Really? You are not going to regret this. No sirree. I gotta say, I think we're on the cusp of something great. Something epic, something unprecedented. Ah! [impressed whistle] Hamster of Darkness. That's the Big One. When we find it, they'll put us on the cover of Adventure Weekly and Adventure Monthly. And Chickenhare, if they put your name first, I'm totally fine with that, just happy to be part of the team. You think she brought anything to plug my ears? Hey, what kind of name is Chickenhare anyway? Is that part Yukinarian? Uh… I actually don't know. Really? No clue? Because it is such a unique name. Well, it's very unusual. Because I see the hare, but I don't see the chicken. I'm gonna figure this out, I'm great at puzzles. Well, that's too bad. Looks like we'll have to head back. Follow me. [grunts] Your turn. [sighs] Why can't I meet anyone who shares my pessimism? Ow! If you take off that jacket, it might help with your follow-through. Just a suggestion. What do I know, I'm just a skunk. No, no. I'm good! Third time's a charm! Oops. Now what? Stay put and don't try anything foolish. [ominous music] I expected more from you, Luther. -I won't tolerate another mistake. -[baby crying] And why is this thing even here, why isn't he at home with your wife? What has happened to you? See, Lapin, me and my wife have 2-3 jobs. It's hard, you know, providing for the baby. See, I can't afford the cost of diapers and… Enough! Has the entire criminal underworld gone soft since I've been locked up? [clears throat] Do me a favor, go back to your wife. Go! -Woah! -Oh good, the duck's back. Please tell me something positive. Chickenhare made it through the Desert of Death. What? Impossible! Well, technically improbable since he did make it through. He's a couple clicks behind us. What are clicks? I hear that term on missions like this, but I don't know what they are. Destroy the bridge. It will take them a week to get around the quicksand. By then, I'll have Featherbeard completely under my control. [evil laughter] Our control. Huh? Your control… obviously. [suspenseful music] Ugh. We'll have to go around, that's gonna take at least a week. We don't have a week. My Uncle Lapin'll already have the hamster by then. We can cross it. Sure, for a couple of feet. But then we'd die! Because this is quicksand! It sucks you under until you die! That's what it does, its reason for existing! Chickenhare is right, we should try. The quicksand is only in a few spots. If we avoid them, we'll have a solid path. Do you know where that path is? Follow in my footsteps and you'll be okay. I'll go last. [mysterious music] Who's this Uncle Lapin? Oh, he's just a genius adventurer with grandiose plans most likely covering a deep-seeded insecurity. Sounds like someone else I know. -Chickenhare! -Oh no! -Chickenhare! -Abe, help! Grab onto me. Darn, I'm a goner too. Hey, watch the shell! Hold on, Chickenhare. [groaning] Woah! Meg! I'm going down! Stay still, don't move. [groans] -Woah! -What are you doing? Grab the whip! With your hands! Isn't that kind of implied? [grunting] Just pull! -[Meg] Help, Abe! Hurry! -[gasps] Use your hands! Isn't it a pretty simple concept he's failing to grasp? Abe! Ah! Oh, my gosh! I'm pulling him out of his skin! [screaming] [breathing heavily] Wait, are those… chicken legs? Woah, woah! Hold on a second. Chickenhare… Oh, lightning bolt! That's where the name comes from! Told you I was great at puzzles! Those are chicken feet. Woah! You're part chicken, part hare, aren't you? [grunting] Hello, what about me? Hey, a little help here, guys, I'm stuck. [cheerful music] -Do you have other chicken parts? -No. [coughs] -Hey! -Wow! That is… awesome! What else? [gasps] Do you have wings? You have wings under that jacket! Nope. You've seen the top-shelf stuff. Just feathers under there. -Lemme see 'em. -No! -Are there other chickenhares? -Not that I know of. You're your own species! How awesome is that? You're automatically endangered. -It's not awesome! -So like what you can do? Oh my gosh, you can fly! I can't fly. Chickens can't even fly. Uh, technically they can over very short distances. Oh come on, but you're only part chicken. How many flying hares have you ever seen? Well, none. But I've also never seen a hare with such gigantic floppy ears. -I mean, on an elephant. -I can't fly! [screams] You can fly! [all groan] See, I can't fly. I can't clear a bar with my scent like you Meg. There's nothing good about being me, okay? Oh… You've got a "me" problem. Uh… I think we got a "we" problem. [gasps] Oh no! [upbeat music] [Abe] Ow. [Chickenhare] Pigmies? Oh! Woah! Heya! We come in peace. For the record, I didn't wanna come at all. Blast 'em. Blast 'em all. Hold on, I can't, I haven't recharged yet. "Haven't recharged!" What happened to being special? [laughs] Hey! That tickles! Behold! Ooo. The Chickenhare! God of the land and sky! Flyer over short distances! [crows] Part chicken, part hare. Almighty! [all] Woah. [tribal music] You are a god? Uh… Sure? That's good enough for me. Prepare the feast! See, "me" problem. Tonight, we shall ply the almighty Chickenhare and his strange helpers with our finest banquet! And then, tomorrow at first light, we shall take them to our volcano, and sacrifice the god Chickenhare to our god… Santoro the Stoic! I think you're just the thing to finally put a smile on Santoro's face. Just to be clear, Chickenhare's the only one going in the volcano, right? [intriguing music] [huffing] Nom, nom. Wow. That meal was incredible. These guys know how to throw a sacrifice. See, Meg, this is what happens when I'm myself. Maybe we could take a break from the pity party? Let me tell you about a little skunk named… I don't know… "Peg." Oh, I love a good story, especially after a meal like that. Growing up, nobody wanted a play date with "Peg," on account of her being a skunk. Even when she got cool new dolls, and had goody bags for her birthday, nobody came. She bathed twice a day, didn't matter. So… she corked herself. [all] Ouch! Ouch is right. But that didn't work either. So naturally, "Peg" got angry… Her parents had her channel that anger into positivity. So, she got a black belt in karate… and Kung Fu… and Kendo… and seven other martial arts. But that didn't help either. She was still angry. Deep down, "Peg" still wished she was anything but a skunk. Until the day she went on a field trip to the Royal Treasury, and then Billy Goat Jones, the jerk who teased "Peg" the most, shut the door behind us. The treasurer was the only one with the combination. What happens when a skunk fears for her life? Well, "Peg" was a skunk who feared for her life and had been corked for 3 years. "Peg" saved everyone that day. [Chickenhare] You were a hero and everyone loved you, Meg. Uh, I mean "Peg". No, they treated me worse than ever. But for the first time, I didn't care. I realized the thing that I was corking, wasn't something to be ashamed of. No, it's what made me special. Chickenhare, you're a corker. Until you blow open your treasury vault, you won't know what makes you special. [yawns] Nice story, Meg, and I liked the way you changed your name to make it feel more universal. But when the volcano turns us to ash, it isn't gonna discriminate between the corkers and the non-corkers. True. But they're not gonna throw us in that volcano. Uh… -They're not? -Nope. Because you're gonna break us out. [snoring] -Are you sure about this? -Trust me. [suspenseful music] [sneezes] [Pigmies snoring] [triumphant music] [Pigmies sneezing] [snoring] [intriguing music] [snoring continues] [whispering] Chickenhare. [calm music] [whispering] I'll be right back. No. [sighs] [grunts] Really? [sighs] [thrilling music] [grunting] Chickenhare, don't. You don't need those. [sighs] [signals transmitting] [intriguing music] [gasps] [gasp] [signals continuing transmitting] Well, you know, I always felt waiting 'til first light was a bit arbitrary. Take them to the volcano now! Put down your weapons, or your god gets it! Abe? Come on, guys, hurry up. Look how Santoro maintains his stoicism, even with a spear at his throat. Let's see how he maintains his stoicism rolling down a hill! Now they'll all follow him as we make our escape… -Or not. -Get them! [upbeat music] [panting] Oh great Santoro, your revenge is at hand! Watch out! [Abe] This isn't worth perpetual three-day weekends! No, come here! Woah! [sighs] Tell me you've recharged! I'm trying! Almost there. [screams] I'm starting to think you're not special at all, you just have an enormous ego! There we go, I'm back. Fire in the hole! [slowed down music] Ow! [breathing heavily] Chickenhare! [intriguing music] -Chickenhare! This way! -Coming! [growls] [triumphant music] [gasp] Woah! [growls] Chickenhare! Your moves have moves. Good work, Chickenhare. Did you see that? [shrieks] [war cry] Let's go. Look! [Chickenhare] Woah, the mountain! [rumbling] [thrilling music] Incoming! -Meg, get us across! -I can't do it. I can't do it. Last time I tried… Last time your jacket was holding your arm back. You're almost here, Chickenhare. -Wow, I did it! Hang on! -Here we go! [Abe laughs] Woohoo! [Abe] Oh, please. No! You couldn't have brought the large whip, could you, Meg? I hate adventuring! [scream] Hey! It's even further than I thought. [screaming] [breathing heavily] According to the map, the temple's at the top of the mountain. We need a plan. Lapin is probably halfway up there already. I have a plan! If we take the Nearly Impassable Pass, by the time the trails merge, we should be ahead of them… Sounds like a genius plan to me. We might actually get that Hamster of Darkness after all. What do you mean "might"? Lapin's gonna eat our feather dust. Uh… Abe? This mud's actually very nutrient-rich. Uh, let's go. Hey, I wanna stop Lapin as much as you, well maybe 10% as much as you, but can't we look good doing it? [soft music] [ominous music] [Barry screams] Here I am. You won't believe it. Chickenhare's heading up the Nearly Impassable Pass! What? Impossible! Huh? No, again I think it's more improbable than impossible. You know, I tell you what, the way he's going, the Three Deadly Trials won't be a problem for Chickenhare. Get the dynamite. Come on, Abe! We're closing in on them. Hello, I'm a turtle! Are you completely unaware of my species' role in fables? [grunting] [explosion] You idiots! The avalanche was supposed to take out Chickenhare, not us! [distant screaming] It really is difficult to find good help these days. [echoing] Lapin! Lapin! Look, Lapin's a goner. -I guess there's nothing we can do. -Yeah there is. You're right, nothing we can do. Oh, let's go. Sorry, guys. [calm music] According to the legend, we're looking for a hamster face etched in the ice. [Meg] I got it! This way! Alright, we're going in. You read my mind, partner. Wait. Lapin's dead and buried. Probably not in that order. We saved the kingdom. We're done here. Let's go home. Abe, if I can bring back the Hamster of Darkness, my dad will let me join the Royal Adventure Society. Isn't it enough that you made it this far? And who's gonna believe me? I need the hamster as proof. Now the only thing standing between us and it are the Three Deadly Trials. Abe, if you wanna stay behind, fine, but… I'm in! [grunts] [sighs] I've always been a follower. I want every other Thursday off too! [mysterious music] "In order to enter the Temple of the Hamster of Darkness, one must pass the Three Deadly Trials." Why's it always three? Why can't it ever be two trials? What's the first one? "We hamsters may be small of stature, but we are cool under pressure. We never lose our heads, even when confronted by imminent death." "Imminent death"! That's how we start? Sadistic little rodents, aren't they? "Small of stature"… Ah! "Cool under pressure"… [Abe screams] Hey! A secret passage! -Well done! -Let's get out of here! [breathes heavily] Woah! [groaning] [enchanting music] [Meg] What's the second trial? "Though we hamsters may not be so fleet of foot to outrun our Destiny, we do have the courage to face it." Enough with this fake self-deprecating routine. Why couldn't these hamsters hire shrinks like us? [suspenseful music] Run! [breathing heavily] Look, that's Ramon's wife! It's wonderful that you admire the female form… His wife Destiny. We have to stand here facing Destiny. Oh yeah! Or… we can run! Meg, if you're gonna side with me once before I die, you have 10 seconds. 9… I'm with Chickenhare. Uh-oh, miscalculated! 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1… [scream] [ice breaking] [all] Woah! [calm music] Oh! Think these hamsters had issues with being short? [Abe] Do I even wanna ask what the third trial is? -All the legend says, is: "Do this." -Do what? [childish music] That can't be it. Could it? [childish music stops] [hesitant music] [Abe shrieks] [Abe] Man, these hamsters keep you off-balance. The scepter… [Chickenhare] We made it! I'm taking you home. [breathes heavily] Ah. [Lapin] The Hamster of Darkness. [Meg & Abe shriek] -But you… -Were buried in that avalanche? Or did I make you think I was? See, I asked myself: Why should I try to pass the Three Deadly Trials when my very eager nephew would do it for me? Give me that scepter. [Meg] Don't give it to him! You're smart, Chickenhare. I could use someone like you. You could be in charge of my adventure society. We'll show everyone who laughs at us, take our revenge on those who'd shun us because we're different. We're so alike, you and I. I'm nothing like you. But you are. Because Chickenhare… I'm your father. I'm just kidding. I'm not your father! But wouldn't it have been crazy if I was, right? Give me that scepter or… One more step and I'll throw it over the edge. Do it and I'll throw your friends over. Give it to him! Post haste. Do not call his bluff. Prisoners play a lot of poker! A lot! If I give it to you, you'll let them go? I'll let you all go. I swear it. [Meg] No, he's lying. Ow! Do you know the final piece of the legend, Chickenhare? "He who releases the Hamster of Darkness shall be followed for all of his days." -That's right, little freak. -[both grunt] [clears throat] I, Lapin the IX, call upon you to bring the darkness. [intense music] [whimpering] What have I done? [evil laughter] What do you say we go take back my kingdom? - What about the freak and his friends? - I promised I'd let them go. So, let them go… over the edge. Darn semantics… [all scream] [clatter] [Lapin groans] I have good news and bad news. The bad news is that you should freeze to death in about… 12 hours. Really? I think it's gonna be quicker. What's the good news? Please be that they're sending a rope down for us. The good news is you'll outlive your father, Chickenhare. I wouldn't call that good news. -Maybe slightly better news… -[Lapin's evil laughter] [sighs] We found nothing. It was just another of my brother's tricks. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. If Lapin got the scepter, things could get rough. Go and take shelter in the dungeon. Dad, I've gone to stop Lapin. I know I'm not an Adventurer like you, but I'll try my best. I'm sorry for all this. I love you, Chickenhare. [grunting] This is all my fault. Know what? You're right! It is all your fault! 100%! We could've gone home now, but no, you had to find the Hamster of Darkness. -So everyone would forget you're… -A freak? I thought bringing it back would make them accept me. [sighs] It's not all your fault. It's Meg's fault too. She's a bad influence. And I wasn't gonna say "freak." I was gonna say "Chickenhare." -Same thing. -No, they're not. Look at me! Why couldn't I just be normal? Lapin never would've escaped, and I wouldn't've come here. Because you're not normal! Pretending you were only made it worse. But when you got rid of that costume and became you… You found the hamster. The treasure no adventurer could find for thousands of years. Lapin never would've found it without you. I'm trying to let it go, but I can't. All of us are born with things that make us different. The only choice we have is how we see those things. So, we can either be ashamed of them or we can embrace them and see that our differences make us… Special. -No! -Chickenhare! [intriguing music] [Abe cheers & laughs] Whoop-de-doo! [Abe] Woohoo! Really? [sighs] -[Ape pants] -Come on, Abe. They're too far ahead. When we get to your kingdom, it'll be too late. We've come too far. There's gotta be a way. -I have a plan. -You have a plan? I have my moments. My secret shame. I was born without a shell. This one's my Uncle Herb's… Love you Uncle Herbie! Woah! What? It's not like I got feathers growing out of my head. It's not that. It's just that, uh… you're really pale. Eww. That is unattractive. Eh, anyway, who's ready to ride? [screaming] -Should've used less wax! -Get down! -[Abe] Ow! -[Chickenhare] Watch out! [groan] [Meg] Woohoo! Alright! -We're gonna catch Lapin. -Or not. [screaming] [Lapin hums] [Abe] I hate adventuring. [panting] Sir, Lapin's at the gate. He requests to see you. Let's settle this! [Lapin hums] Not another step forward, Brother, until you tell me where my son is. You mean that worthless little half-breed freak? He's not coming back. I made quite sure of that. [roar] Hold it. Brother, please. Where is my son? [laughs] I assume he froze to death on the side of the cliff I threw him over. No! The scepter? That's right! I found it. Ah, technically Chickenhare found… Enough talk. Hamsters, attack! [all] Ah! [Lapin's evil laughter] [frantic commotion] Sounds like a lost cause. My favorite kind. Meg, I'll need your whip. -Thought you'd never ask. -[sighs] [rebellious music] We can sneak up on Lapin. That's a terrible plan, he's got a million hamsters. Lance, Whitey! Chickenhare! We thought you were dead. Nope. Alive and kicking with these. So, where do we stand? [Lance] It looks pretty hopeless. We gotta get down there. We gotta find a way to get past those million hamsters. With big tails. What? I was born without a shell. A dose of skepticism has been essential to my survival. That's how we sneak up on Lapin! -With my skepticism? -No, with your shell. Well, at least we know your plan's not the worst one, Whitey. Mine, at long last. [laughs] Oh! Perfect fit. Actually, I'll need to have it taken in a little because you have such a big fat head, Brother. Maybe you're not so perfect after all. [glorious music] [groans] What? Peg, say hello to my little smelly friend! [suffocating] Hey, Chickenhare's plan worked! Woah! Chickenhare! You? Hamsters, I command you to fight no more and return to the scepter. I mean it. I'm serious. I command you! [weakly] Please… [evil laughter] Fool! That scepter is nothing without me. "For he who releases the Hamster of Darkness shall be followed for all of his days." The power's already mine. That's not true. Without the scepter, he will lose his power. Then I'll get rid of it. Hamsters… [Lance & Whitey] Run, Chickenhare! Attack! Argh. [evil laughter] [screaming] Oops. Now what? What are you waiting for? Break that wall! [breathing heavily] [evil laughter] [explosion] [gasps] Get the scepter, now, before he throws it in the pit! [grunts] Hamsters, the wheel! [grunts] Okay, Chickenhare, that's how you want to play it, then let's do it my way. [shrieks] [Barry] Ow! How does it look? That wasn't there before. [squeaky chuckling] [grunts] [crows] Hey rodents, come and get us if you dare! -[Abe] Hi there. -[groan] [grunting] [grunting] [screaming] [hamsters squealing] Woah! Look at him! Get me the scepter if you want to fly another day. Woah! [Barry grunts] -Come on! -[Barry laughs] -[grunting] -Huh? Woah, woah, woah! [screams] Game over, Lapin. No it's not, we're just about to get started. [intense music] [grunting] [groans] [gasps] [sighs] [laughing] [cheering] Catch me if you can! [laughs] -Let's finish this, Brother. -Not so fast. Huh? Argh! Hamsters, charge! Finish him, Chickenhare's mine. [grunting] [crying out in pain] -[groans] -[gasps] [screaming] [screaming] [growls] [suspenseful music] Give me that! [Chickenhare grunting] -[screams] -[laughs] Good riddance. [exhales in relief] [both grunting] [evil laughter] Uncle! [screaming] Uncle! -[groans] -[grunts] [gasps] I got you, come on. Huh? [screaming] [screams] Chickenhare, no! Fly chicken, fly. Oh! [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] [evil laughter] If I'm going down, at least I'm taking you with me. What? Impossible! [all] Woah! [soft music] [pant] Woohoo! [joyous music] [laughs] Hey, guys, I'm back! Alright, you did it! Did you see that? I can fly! Nah. I wouldn't call that flying, more like gliding. Ugh. Abe, cork it, will you? Chickenhare, you found it. Yeah, but Lapin took it and… Not the Hamster of Darkness, Chickenhare. You. You found you. I'm glad. Me too, Dad. Woah. A hare who can fly. How cool is this? What are you talking about? He can fly because he's a chicken. What? He's a hare. -Chicken. -Hare. -Chicken. -Hare. -Chicken. -Hare. So what'd I miss? Huh? Oh… oh. Hey! Hey! What do you want from me? I just… Chickenhare? Chickenhare. [gasps] I knew it. [soft music] Chickenhare, what are you doing? Guys, I just discovered the location of the holy spork! We leave in 5 minutes. But they're just about to start bringing out the hors d'oeuvres. But what about your induction? This is what you've wanted your whole life. Sorry, don't have time. Hold on, Chickenhare. You can't leave… without this. [gasps] Woah! Your golden machete. You really mean this? I love you, Dad. Now, go get that holy spork. [cheerful music] [sighs] What are the odds both of my best friends are masochists? Hey! Subtitling TITRAFILM
