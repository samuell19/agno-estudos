Adjust timing and translation MOHAMED GAMAL.(M.G) 'I have travelled to every part of India.' 'And I have not seen a single person begging or stealing.' 'I have seen so much wealth...' 'knowledge and mannerisms in that country.' 'And I have seen many skilled people there.' 'That I can't even imagine if we can ever control India.' 'There is only one way to control it.' 'We need to break the spine of that nation.' 'And that is the Indian spiritual heritage and mannerisms.' 'I suggest that we should change their old...' 'way of learning and mannerisms.'

"There is darkness everywhere" "I cannot find light" "I don't find my life..." "...even faraway" "Which is this place?" "I don't know" "Is there no caravan travelling on this road?" "The road and the heart are both sighing" "It is scared and apprehensive" "Let me light a torch" "There will be some light" "Something might be lacking on the road" Your majesty, allow me to introduce Ameer Haider, King of Analwara. Inheritor of the largest land holding... in the terrain region of Oudh. He must be brought up like an English boy. Believing in our lords and our sense of fair play. Do you hear me? Yes, your majesty. Your majesty... her highness is saying that... you will be educated like an English boy. Your father was a loyal subject and I loved him dearly. He died valiantly fighting for me. Grow up quickly and avenge... your father and your queen. This is a token of our love and trust... in the future Raja and a warrior. I am greatly honored, your majesty. He is now a true Englishman, Sir John Cavendish. Then my work is now complete, your majesty. Not yet, Sir Cavendish. We have decided to appoint you as... the chief commissioner of Oudh... to properly administer that tragically mismanaged region. And of course, you will also see that the boy... does not stray from the path of loyalty. Attack! Hail Noor! This is not just a game of hands. This is the miracle of the mind. When your body and mind concentrates at one point... then you become a complete weapon. After that no stick, spear, mace or sword makes a difference. But remember one thing. One must use their body when you know you're truthful. The truth is Lord Ali! The truth is Lord Ali! The truth is Lord Ali! "Whoever will look into your eyes" "Whoever will look into your eyes" "He will hurt his heart and liver" "He will try to cross your path with various excuses" "He won't get any respite" "Wherever he goes the rascal will say..." Are you going straighten out or shall I get my shoe to hit you? Mother, why should you? I will get you your shoes. Practice well, otherwise I'll stop going to the mosque. Here comes Queen Victoria. "Your sharp eyes killed me" "Your sharp attitude killed me" "Killed me... Killed me..." "Your sharp eyes killed me" "Your sharp eyes killed me... Killed me..." "Your sharp eyes killed me" "Your sharp eyes killed me" "Your sharp eyes killed me" "Your sharp..." "Your sharp..." "Your sharp..." Wonderful. My darling. Cast away the evil eye from the girl. - May God protect you. - May God bless my child. (Farmers shouting out) Don't burn my crops. How can I cultivate opium, sir? - Beautiful. - You know Mangal... Do you know what will happen... if you don't follow my orders? No! Ameer. Ameer, my son. - Be happy. - Greetings. Bless you. Wonderful! Wonderful! I thought I could never see you return to Analwara. But God answered my prayers. Even I am very happy to return to my country, grandpa. I was yearning. I was yearning to hear this word. The great ship that we travelled from. - Very good. Very good. - And look at this. Wonderful! You're with the queen in this picture. Sir. The King of Alipur is coming. Oh Wonderful! Good day! Good day! Come. Welcome, honorable king. Ameer, meet him. He is King Rajeshwar Narayan Dutt Singh. How do you do, sir? Not like this, my prince. Hug me. Do you know I consider your mother as my daughter? Wonderful. Wonderful. You have completely taken after your father. But the rascal has taken my daughter's sight. - Of course. - I will take your leave, grandpa. Come with me. Bye. Greetings. Come, dear king. Have a seat. Have you told him what happened here? Mr. Raja if I had the courage to tell him... then I wouldn't have behaved so cowardly. Honorable king, May I? Please. "Love me too" "Love me too" "Ask after me too" "Love me too" "Ask after me too" "Love me too" "A big killer" "A big killer" "A big killer" "You have made me a big killer" "You have made me a big killer" "Taken my life, heart and liver" "Taken my life, heart and liver" "Taken my life, heart and liver" "Taken my life, heart and liver" "Love me too" "If received..." "If received..." "If received..." "If an empty glass is received..." "If an empty glass is received..." "Do I have the permission to fill it?" "Do I have the permission to fill it?" "Do I have the permission to fill it?" "Do I have the permission to fill it?" "Love me too" Wonderful. "We will go..." "We will go..." "We will go..." "We will go with the heart..." "We will go with the heart..." "Take me as your companion too" "Take me as your companion too" "Take me as your companion too" "Take me as your companion too" "Love me too" "Look after me too" "Love me too" "Look after me too" "Love me too" She has danced very well Madam Mushtari Bai. But she is also very dangerous. This dance has led to lose of the Oudh's kingship. Yes. - Hello. - Hello. By the way... I've heard a lot of bad things about Indian dance. But you dance very well. I mean you perform really well. Really? I had never seen such a performance in my life. Yes, but why would you see it? Queen Victoria doesn't know Kathak. Maybe you are making fun of me. Goodness! I can't dare to make fun of you, sir. I am just saying that sir has completely become English. He will take years to understand Awadh. Keep cool, Noor. It's against our principles to leave the stage like this. Didn't you hear what that red faced monkey was saying? What? I won't dance in front of him again. I will decide whom you will dance for. If I want then you will have to dance for dogs too. I am ready to dance for the dogs. You speak too much. You little b**ch. Do you think I don't know what you are doing? Sitting there. Making eyes. Flirting with those black b****ds. I won't do it again. I promise Mr. Cavendish. I will be good. I promise. Ah! That hurts! Yes, you will be pardoned. But you will do nothing without my say so. Don't you know that these jewels come at a price? You know that little cat. Yes, Mr. Cavendish. "Friends, listen to the boyhood of the villager." "And don't ask about the childhood of the city dweller." Wonderful. "The villager's boyhood dances like the God." "His boyhood is spent making the cows graze." Very good. Very good. "He played the flute wonderfully in his boyhood." "What more should I say about Lord Krishna's boyhood?" Beautiful! Beautiful! Take this. I have gone around the entire area. And he is still doing his makeup. Be scared of God, dear king. Be scared of God. Cutting my hair is not makeup. - Greetings. - Greetings. Please recite what you were just reciting. Nothing, I was just reciting Nazir Akhbarbadi's... - poem in praise of Lord Krishna. - Come. Come in. "Now how do I describe how he used to walk?" "Or should I describe how he used to talk sweetly?" "Or should I describe how he was being raised?" "Or shall I describe how you used to write in people's laps?" - Wonderful. - Wonderful. - Beautiful. Beautiful. - Very good. Very good. "The way he used to walk with shaky steps." "Sometimes Yashoda would hold him." "And sometimes Nand used to take care." - Wow. Wonderful! - Wonderful! Wonderful! This is our Ganga Jamuni manners. The poet is Muslim but he is writing about Lord Krishna. Wow! Wonderful. Sir... Even a Hindu poet reflects the same spirit. He has written such praises about Rasool Akram... that it cannot be compared with any Muslim. No doubt. Without a doubt. But will Ameer understand all this? I am worried about it. He is the king of this empire. It is necessary for him to learn the ways of his ancestors. You are right. But sir, we cannot make Ameer understand all these things. Why don't send him to a school... where our ways are being taught? Where do we have such a school, king? There is. Rich men don't go to a courtesans home... just to enjoy dance and music. They also go there to learn manners. And then no one can be a better teacher... then your old lover Mushtari Jaan. You have made a good suggestion, beloved king. But Ameer doesn't consider this courtroom dance honorable. He won't go. At least talk to Mushtari Jaan. Noor's smiles will attract him like a magnet. Khandesh is the place where the all Taluqdars... will be accommodated. The Muslims here. And The Hindus here. Our Taluqdars won't mind staying together, sir. They are united as a caste. Well, my friend, they won't stay like that for long... if I have my way. Tell me if these fellows have a club of their own. Yes, the British Indian Association. My grandfather has maybe joined as a member. Then perhaps I can address when your... British Indian Association has its elections. I've been told to elect their presidents unanimously sir. Oh no! We can't have that. Can we? In the interest of democracy there must be fair and free elections. In the interest of fairness there will be one... Hindu and one Muslim candidate. You of course will be the Muslim candidate. I cannot do that, sir. Nobody will vote for me. You will be surprised. I will speak with the Hindu candidate. Ask him to stand and then step down in your favor. - But sir. - Take it as an order. The Queen will appreciate your gesture. Consider your work to be done, your majesty. Just send the prince here once. And then watch the miracle of Mushtari Jaan. He will come as impure gold and we will refine him. - Amen. - Amen. Take this. Consider it as a gift. "The light wants flies…" My child of the divine God. Why are you still sitting like this? Didn't I tell you to get ready before nightfall? "The lamp wants a fly before it gets extinguished." "Romeo needs to be crazy to be a successful lover." Oh God. You recite well. This belongs to me. Stop! Stop! Noor. Mother, you have hidden this treasure in your cupboard. Noor. One minute. Mother, other things are written here too. But I am not able to read it. "Attack on begum Hazrat Mahal's caravan." Don't you dare to touch my things? What would happen, if I read it? I will allow you to read it when it is the right time. Now go and get ready. Here is the dress. The King is coming to meet you. Get ready fast, dear. Come on. - Naseeban. - Yes. Prepare the betel leaf triangles and come downstairs. Yes, madam. "That black brave sir." Get up. I will prepare them. - Greetings. - Greetings. Come. Come, sir. Greetings. Greetings. Greetings, sir. Greetings. Greetings. I will perform a dance recital for you. Will the sir have some betel leaves? Betel leaves. I don't eat betel leaves. Your majesty, your grandpa has ordered us... to teach you the manners of Nawabs and the royalties. We can't do it if you impose everything so vehemently? I really don't eat betel leaves. Then start having it from today. If you say so. Wait, sir. Not like this, sir. First place a gift and the plate and then take a triangle. Triangle. Okay. God. Please hurry up. My arms are tired. Sorry. Go ahead. You are completely ignorant. Put the entire triangle in your mouth. The entire thing. - The entire triangle. - Yes. What happened? What happened, sir? What happened? What did that triangle contain? My entire mouth… God. You fool, Nasseban! - Coming. - Naseeban. You are so old but you still don't know how to prepare betel. You have applied so much lime in the king's betel leaf. He has burnt his mouth. Madam Noor had prepared the betel leaf. - Noor? - Yes. Sorry, my king. It was a mistake. Just lick this coolant and… No. No. Give me leave. My mouth is burnt. Sir. This girl will be the ruin of me. She will have me dishonored. Mr. Chaubey, you can take her picture now. The photo should complement my beautiful daughter. My daughter Mehrunissa will become a bride now. Very good. Wow. "Your sharp eyes killed me" "Your sharp eyes killed me" "Your sharp..." "Your sharp..." "Your sharp..." - Hello. - Hello. So you have come. Yes. So why have you sent for me? How is the king? I haven't seen him since the last 2 days. What can I say? He is unwell. Someone fed him a betel leaf filled with lime. His mouth has swollen up and his tongue is charred. God. Who has hurt him so bad? I don't know who can be enemies... with a good man like Ameer. "When I see her eyes, I get intoxicated." "Darling comes with the color of spring." - "Good news comes." - Wonderful. I have got honey from the doctor. Have it. Your throat will get healed. I will have this honey but only on one condition. Tell me. Recite a beautiful song. What song do you want to hear? A song by Wajid Ali Shah. "Darling comes with the color of spring." "Good news comes." "Darling comes with the color of spring" "Darling comes with the color of spring" "Good news comes" "Good news comes" "Darling comes with the color of spring" "If he smiles and sees the mirror" "If he smiles and sees the mirror" "Even the mirror becomes proud" "Even the mirror becomes proud" "Darling comes with the color of spring" "What do I do with an empty glass, partner?" "What do I do with an empty glass, partner?" "The drink comes in repeatedly" "The drink comes in repeatedly" "Good news comes" "Color of spring..." "Comes..." What are you looking at in my eyes? - Do you know? - What? Eyes are very talkative. What cannot be said with your mouth... are expressed by the eyes in a minute. Really? So tell me what are my eyes telling you right now? They are saying that it is almost evening. We should return before the lamps are lighted. Absolutely wrong. I was thinking that it is a full moon night today. It is about to be evening. Let's go and tour the Gomti. Let's go. It will be fun. But it will be useless. Because we won't even look at the sky. Why won't we? Because you will be with me down on earth. Goodness. Here both the eyes and the lips are talkative. Since long even this heart is saying something. Do you want to hear it? Elder brother, all preparations have been made. Before the British announces their plans... to crown Victoria as the queen of India... we should kill and throw out the British. And we should bring back our king from Kolkata... and have him crowned again. With the grace of God. Of course. If God wills. Khan is right. It is time to take up arms. Arms were also taken up 20 years ago. But what was the result? We lost. I have seen the corpses hanging on both sides... of the road from Kanpur to Allahabad. Who were those people who were being hanged? The corpses which didn't even get a proper burial. They were your fathers, brothers and sons. And you want us to repeat this bloody episode again. Comrades, you need both strength of body... and mind to fight. And it is smart to keep your excitement in check. Also be sure that there will be a revolution. Always keep this amulet with you. Yes. It contains Awadh's soil and Gomti's water. And the mark on it is your identity. - Go. - Be victorious. "The hair is troublesome... Shame, control yourself" "The hair is troublesome... Shame, control yourself" "The day is over, it's night, have some patience" "It might become someone else's... Control..." "You might be taken over by the crazies... Control..." "The hair is troublesome... Shame, control yourself" "I cannot look into the mirror now" "I can bear to be beheaded but..." "I cannot surrender" "The one who honored and respected you" "The one who gave you means and property" "The one who gave you a new fortune" "The one who taught you the lessons of righteousness" "Gave me" "Will you be able to see..." "this dual colored world?" "Will you be able to see..." "The mark of the British there?" I love you a lot, Noor. Do you love me too? How much? More than myself. And less than Awadh. Live long, dear. Greetings. - Take. - You are a Hindu, grandpa. Then why are you following these Muslim traditions? I know? A king's religion is his subject's religion. If we can celebrate Muharram even by being a Hindu... then even your grandpa celebrates Holi and... Diwali in spite of being a Hindu. This is the heritage here. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah used to hold Raas Leelas. And he used to play Lord Krishna himself. Don't talk about Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, grandpa. He was an indolent and useless king who was... always engaged in dance, music, pigeon and kite flying. My boy... if such rumors were not spread... then the English wouldn't have any excuse... to dethrone the Nawab. It is not an excuse. It is the reality. Reality! Do you know the reality? Don't ask the English officers. Ask the common people of Awadh... about Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. Ask them how was he like. "When the cushion was stolen from the royal court" "Zainab sighed and held her heart with her hands" "Where was it hidden? There was no respite" "The verses are requesting and praying to you" "Master, your harem is getting robbed" "Here I am getting robbed because I try to save my verses" Open the door! Open the door! Who is it? Open the door! The house is closed for Muharram. Come later. Muharram or no Muharram! Break open the door. There will be no dance and music for 40 days. In our rule nothing will be stopped. These rascals are intoxicated. They won't be listen to us easily. Break open the door. What happened, mother? Take the girls and go inside. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. And Mahapara. Where is Mahapara? Mahapara. They are intoxicated. God. Oh God, help us! Have pity. Aslam Mia. Yes. What is this? Alijan! We want wine. Wine. Sir, it is a sin to even talk of alcohol during Muharram. Mother. Alijan. What are you doing? Stop! Let her go. Let her go. Go. Go. Officer! Hey, leave them. My God. My God. What will happen now? Punishment to kill the British is very harsh. And so my dear friends... and members of the British Indian Association... as mark of gratitude from the queen herself... his excellency Lord Lytton, the viceroy of India... has invited the Taluqdars of Oudh... to the grand bar. Wow! Wow! - And now to business. - Yes. The names of the candidates for the election... of the president of the British Indian Association of Oudh. The Hindu candidates... King Shyam Sunder. King of Ganganagar. Great, my king, great. And the Muslim candidate King Ameer Haider. Wow! Ameer. - Good luck. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. Leave that alone. You must never touch that. Do you hear? Mr. Cavendish. Oh my little... delicious... Mischievous... Mr. Cavendish. Naseeban, at least go and straighten those columns. And Zeeniya, the drinks should be properly sweetened. It won't be good if it is not tasty. Yes, dear. Spread it nicely. Yes. The King of Analwara is coming. Mother. There is going to be a function in the evening. - Why did you call the king? - I haven't called him. - Greetings. - He might have come to meet you. Greetings. Greetings. I was passing by so I thought I should ask after Noor. - Yes, of course. - Who has come, Mushtari? May God bless them! May the dead go to hell! The rascal forced inside the house. They didn't even think that it is Muharram. What is the matter, madam? Greetings. Who came? Why are you so angry? Four British soldiers had come. Dear... God saved us somehow. The neighbors came to save us. Those rascals had taken hold of Noor. Who knows what would have happened? What is she saying? I am not able to believe it. The British are very just and well behaved. How can they do this? I am sorry, my king. You have spent your life in London. You only saw what the British showed you. But every coin has two sides. Now you are here. So you can see their other face too. I will see it, if you will show it to me. The king has come. - Who farms here? - I do, my sir. Then why are these lands infertile? Sir, they had burnt the wheat crop... and are trying to cultivate opium. Even that didn't get cultivated, sir. But what was the need of burning the existing crop... to cultivate a new crop? Sir, this is not decided by the farmers. It is an order from the government. I don't understand how can such a foolish race... takeover such a huge country like India. They don't even know that the land or weather... of Awadh is not suitable to farm opium. They forcefully burnt the existing crop of wheat. And the opium plants were burnt by this heat. Now both the farms and our stomachs are empty. People are dying in every house, sir. Why didn't you tell them that if you cultivate... opium, then what will you eat? We made many requests, sir. Then? What did they say? We got this answer, sir. Who is the owner of these lands? This is your empire, king. You are the owner of these lands. These are the pictures of Telangana. 4000 people are dying of hunger. This is not good. I haven't even imagined that famine has spread all over the country. Ten million people have died so far. One crore people. One crore people has died. But why? Because the rice, the wheat is being sent to Britain. And the farmers are being forced to grow opium. Forced to grow opium? Why are we forced to grow opium? Why should we grow opium? To make Chinese addicted to it. It's the only way to make them weak. Even grass won't grow in this winter. Everyone is running away from hunger. Please feed the children. God will bless you. Since the British has come from hell there is ruin everywhere. Was anyone hungry in the reign of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah? God knows when they will go away from here. Madam, speak softly. Go away. Naseeban. Naseeban. Go and get some rice and lentils to them. Okay? - Yes, madam. - Hurry up. Make the babies stop. If you could give us some money... we could have bought some milk. You shall get what is promised to you. Now go to some other house. Naseeban. God will show mercy. Wait. Wait. Here. God bless you. May your life always be full of happiness. Noor, have you gone crazy? You just gave away jewellery worth thousands. The jewellery can be bought. But pray that this time doesn't come again. This girl is getting out of control. We'll have to do something about her. She's his blood. He too was large hearted like her. This is disastrous. King Ganganagar withdrew his nomination... from the elections of the British India Association. That's why I wish to nominate you. Ameer is a better candidate than me. He is young, literate. You know very kind. Your Highness, we hold your friendship with prince Iqbal in high regard. But the question is will the Muslim member... of the association support us Hindu members. The times have changed. Now you can't trust anyone. Very good. Look at that. Your friend is heading for the table of the Hindu kings. You said that he is on our side. When the time comes, he'll support us. Don't be so proud of your friends. The bond of religion is much stronger that the bond of friendship. It's simple. Since we're not willing to accept a Hindu as our leader... then why would they support a Muslim? - You are r… - Right. Tell us. So Your Highness, you've spending a lot of time in their camp. Is everything alright? I'm torn between two parties. If I accept their terms I'm a culprit. If I don't then won't be able to face you. Hats off to these Britishers. They haven't been here for long. And they've already ended... the 300 year old Hindu-Muslim relationship. I'll not contest these elections. But why? The commissioner has already announced your name. This is not just an election. This is a conspiracy to make Hindu and Muslim contest against each other. You're saying this. Yes. I've understood their game. And I am not willing to be a pawn in this game. I'm glad that you've understood these Englishmen. Be it a little late. I was wondering. How can the son of the martyr Abbas Haider... be the slave of these Britishers? Who told you this story? My father wasn't a martyr. He supported the Britishers for which I have been rewarded. This. Look at this. Look at this. The proof of loyalty to queen Victoria. I've heard that you're raising the land taxes. Is it true? Yes. The viceroy wants us to pay the expenses of the Delhi court. It is the only way to fill out the depleted profits. You cannot do that. How can famine ridden farmers pay more taxes? This is injustice of the worst kind. It's inhuman. Specially when the famine is your fault... in the first place because you're growing... opium instead of grain. Nonsense. Famine is just nature's way of controlling... excessive population growth. I seem to have been blind about so many things, Sir Cavendish. You're heartless. Loi, I have heard that your daughter wants to marry our King of Analwara. Yes, Mr. Commissioner! My daughter Mehroonisa has lost her heart to Ameer Haider. Heart, you know? She has lost it. Here. Yes. I understand. Ameer is like your son. If you order him, he will not refuse. The British government will… Do you like it? Benefit. And if both of the kingdoms unite... you'll get the tax in lump sum. That's a good thought. - I've seen a girl for Ameer. - Really? Who is she? Tell me. The daughter of Loi. Ameer has a mind of his own just as the Britishers. He won't marry as per our wish. He'll marry as per his wish. If he refuses, the queen queen will be very displeased. Attack! What is happening? Who the hell are they? They're farmers, sir. They want grains. This is a revolt. Hold on. Don't fire. Don't fire. You're enjoying the game of hunting here. And our children are dying of hunger. We want grains. We won't grow opium. You're the one… Yes. That's me. You've seen severed hands so far. Now you'll see how severed heads look like? Don't be silly. Your sticks are no match for these guns. All of you will be killed. We're dying anyways. Whether we die of hunger or bullet. No one's going to die. I'll try that every resident gets grain. We don't trust the slaves of the Britishers. I'm no one's slave. Trust me if you can. Listen, we don't trust you. But we do trust Noor. Noor? Yes. Noor said that you never lie. Let's go. Ameer, my darling. You're a magician. What did you say to those wild men? The commissioner has no right to make decisions of my life. Son... are you saying this because of Noor? Noor is a thousand times better than Mehroonisa. If I was in your shoes... I would've married Mehroonisa... and also maintained my relationship with Noor. No, grandpa. I'll not cheat Noor. Hello, Noor. Greetings, Your Highness. What are you doing here? Well, I live here. Come to my home if you have time. Come? Not now. I came to shop. Now I'm going back. Oh God! - What happened to your neck? - Nothing. Got to go. See you. Horseman... take me home. Quickly. Sit. Did you not like something I said that made you upset? But I'm not upset with you. So then you didn't come for all these days. Nor did you send for me. I miss you all the time. I was facing some problem. Won't you tell me? Do you want to know that the problems are? Look at this. The government has raised the taxes because of the Delhi Court. God have mercy. The poor don't have food to eat. How will they pay the taxes? This is the problem. Will you collect tax? Come, my lad. Come. So what have you done in regards to collecting... the enhanced taxes, my boy? Here's your tax. I see that you've managed to collect them very quickly. Your peasants are very loyal. If I may say. And famine riddled farmers... of Analwara don't have the money to even buy grains. I'm paying this money from my personal wealth. I cannot accept this money. This would set a bad example. And then what would you do next year? And the year after that? You clearly want me to forget your lessons... of freedom, fair play and equality, sir. Do you think you're a free man? And that this is a republic? You're not a free man. So please remember your limits... Ameer Haider. Yes. I know now that in my country... no one is free. Vallab, let's go. Your wish has been fulfilled. I don't take money for raiding graves. Ameer, I am explaining to you for the last time. The girl for whom you're angering the British government... is not worthy of you. How did you make this decision? Not me. She herself has made it. What do you mean? This book has the pictures of all the... girls who are for sale in the market. This book is sent to high ranking officers... sires and kings... so that they can bid and buy. And this book has the picture of your lover too. The officers, sires and kings have her picture. Not her. Greetings, Your Highness. Sit down. - Greetings. - It's really cold too. Would you like some Kehwa(tea)? My sister Bismillah Jaan has sent it from Kashmir. - Where's Noor? - Afzal, get Kehwa? I asked where Noor is. Have you seen Mahapara? She's just 17 years old. My God! She has grown into such a pretty girl. She'll put even the moon to shame. - Naseeban. - Yes, Your Highness. Send Mahapara. I want to meet Noor. Not Mahapara. It's now difficult to meet Noor. Why? Has she gone out somewhere? Yes. You may think so. Noor is now at the service of King Ganganagar. At the service of King Ganganagar. I didn't understand. Noor will live there from now on. She'll be paid 5000 for it. So do you mean… I mean that you forget Noor. Tell me if you're interested in Mahapara. I can't believe this. You're lying. There's a dance program happening at King Ganganagar's place tomorrow. Come there. And the truth or lie will be decided. "It's easy to fall for a beautiful face" "It's easy to fall for a beautiful face" "I remember... I remember..." "I remember the time where the heart mattered" "I remember... I remember..." "I remember the time where the heart mattered" "It is easy to…" "The one who couldn't even apply the henna properly" "The one who couldn't even apply the henna properly" "Why did you make her…" "Why did you make her fall for strangers?" "It's easy to fall for a beautiful face" "It's easy to fall..." "I understood this thing after a long time" "I understood this thing after a long time" "He's a sinner..." "He's a sinner..." "He's a sinner..." "who doesn't listen to his heart" Dance in my wedding too. Here's the advance. Wedding? Mother. I knew that the talks of Ameer's marriage with Loi's daughter are on. But I didn't have the courage to tell you. How could I bear to see my daughter's tears? But Ameer loved me, mother. How did it come to this? These rich brats are such. They have fun at brothels. But love someone else. How are you feeling now? Who are you? A soldier of Awadh. These people call me elder brother. The Britishers call me a rebel. You can call me anything you want. I heard that some people are conspiring against the government. So that's you. Don't term picking up arms... against blunderers from foreign land as conspiracy. These words don't suit the son of the martyr... King Abbas Haider. My father King Abbas Haider laid his life for his country. So King Alipur has told you also the same story. You've been told a story, prince. So that you're also loyal to the Britishers. I don't believe. The Britishers never lie. You will have to believe. Sooner or later. I would like to leave if you're stories and tales are done. Do go. But before you go at least pray at the graves of your parents. The graves of my parents. Yes. This is the place... where the Britishers had attacked... queen Hazrat's Mahal's convey travelling to Nepal. And this is the grave of the martyrs... who died for the sake of their motherland. The British army spared the lives of some wounded people and some kids. I'm one of those wounded people. And you're one of those kids. I told you not to touch that, didn't I? But you have to go and disobey. Come. Come. Come. Now I'll have to kill you, my little cat. Bravo. My lovely little... half-cussed cat... Argh! And I'll keep one of your fingers... as a naive remembrance of you. The box contains all of my trophies. One killing. And one finger. No! No! This is Karbala's soil. Swear on it. And tell me truth. Was my father Abbas was a rebel or the Britishers' loyal? There's no point in bringing up these old things. It will only cause pain. And it will also be decided as to who I am. The son of a patriot or the son of a traitor. Ameer. Speak the truth, grandpa. If you don't speak the truth today... you might never get the chance again. Your father was a brave soldier... who was martyred in the fight to save... the country from the Britishers. So why did you hide such a big thing from me? Because… Because I had made a deal with the Britishers. Else you too would've been killed just like your parents. And we would've never got back this kingdom. Whatever I did was to save your life. I sent you to London with a heavy heart. And I… I myself started leading the life of a coward. These bangles always remind me... as to how shameless and disgusting I am. And a coward. And a coward! So whatever Mir said is absolutely right. Mir? Mir Mohsim. My father's partner. I know Mir Mohsim. He's one of those loyalists... of queen Hazrat Mahal who survived... the Sitauli attack. He had brought you to me. Your Highness, a lady has collapsed at the door of the mansion. Collapsed? This is Kiti Mehtaab. Pick her up. Take her inside carefully. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. He kills people and keeps their fingers as trophies. He wanted to kill me because I saw the proof of his madness. Cut fingers. Good Lord! It's okay. These are Abbas Haider's fingers. I gave him this ring. I gave him this ring. Good Lord. Oh God! Oh God! Ameer. Ameer, my son. My son. Good Lord. Come on. You saw this with your eyes. I saw it with these very eyes. And I had recognized instantly that she's His Highness's wife. But I don't understand why Mushtari Jaan has hidden her? Mushtari Jaan is really smart. I feel she'll make even the city lady dance to her tunes. And you know… Watch her closely. Inform me about everything. You'll get reward. Yes. Yes, Your Highness. Son, what are you thinking looking at your parents' photos? I am just trying to recall when and... who was the last person to tell the truth. The man who raised me as my father. Kept teaching me the meaning of loyalty and honesty. He kept lying to me all his life. And you… You hid the truth that.... that my father wasn't a traitor for 20 years. And that girl. And the girl for whom I was willing... to clash with the British government... even she turned out to be dishonest. May the Lord forgive me! It's true that I lied to you. That monster Cavendish is the murderer of your parents. This is also true. But it's a lie that Noor cheated you. I was afraid that if you don't marry... Loi's daughter then God knows what Cavendish might do. That's Mushtari and I who used a ploy to separate you and Noor. What have you done, grandpa? You've haven't even left me worthy enough to even apologize to Noor. Princesses... are you still sleeping? The maestro is going to be here for the practice. Ustad about to come. And no one is woke up. Open the door! What happened? Stop. Stop. Stop. If you want to listen to the song then come at night. Why have you come now? Shut up! Officer, inform her. Colonel Warden is here with an official order. What have we done that an order has been issued for us? They've come looking for someone. This warrant says identification... inspection and licensing of all coaches... is now mandatory. Tell her. It's the government's order. All the courtesans in the brothel will be checked. The singing and dancing girls of Awadh... must be identified and branded as prostitutes. And as such, you must subject... yourself to medical examination... for venereal diseases. All the courtesans will be examined by doctors. To see if they have any venereal disease. Darn you. We are courtesans. We have some respect. We are not sex workers to have venereal disease. Fool. - Shut up, you old hog. - Mother. Why don't you explain to him... that there are no prostitutes here? You will all be branded as prostitutes. And as such you'll be available for our brave... - British soldiers. - What is he…? All the prostitutes will have to go to the cantonment... to be at the service of the British soldiers. - Darn you. - Rascals. - Take him. I'll come. I'll come. - Mother. Lousy people. Take this, my sandals will look after these Britishers. There's no point in screaming or shouting. Take her inside. And everything will be alright. You scum. - Arrest her. - Curse you! Take her inside. Take them. Mother. Leave me. Mother. Leave me. Mother. Mother. - Leave me. - Leave me. No. Mother. No. Mother. No. Mother. Leave me. Mother. No. Mother. No! No! - No! - Get away from her, you dawg! No. Mother. Mother. "Oh Lord" Mother. Mother, open your eyes. Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. "Oh Lord" "Take the Lord's name for He resides here" "He comes to the aid of the one who calls Him" "They have no worries or sadness" "They have no worries or sadness" "The ones who have faith in the Lord" Wait, Noor. For God's sake, listen to what I have to say. Now there is nothing left to be heard or said. It's all over. My house. My mother. And me too. That loathsome man... That loathsome man who has poisoned all our lives. He wanted to keep me away from you so that I marry Loi's daughter. And dance to his tunes all my life. That's why I was told that... you're now at the service of King Ganganagar. - But that's not true. - I know. But I guess you don't know what this lie has done to me. "Every line on your palms means this..." "Every line on your palms means this..." What happened? - This… - It's nothing. It's nothing. Whether the wounds are physical or mental... they take time to heal. "God is the ultimate truth" I promise you, Noor. They'll have to pay for every pain you've suffered. "Girls are with Radha at the banks of Yamuna" "Girls are with Radha at the banks of Yamuna" "They're waiting for the Lord Krishna" "The crowd is swelling to catch a glimpse" "Here's my request" "Here's my request" "Please play the flute" "Please play the flute" Mother gave me this. She said that this is my identity. Yes. This is your identity. You're not Mushtari's daughter, Noor. Your mother was Zohra, Mushtari's sister... who married Azeemuddin Khan a high ranking officer... of the army of queen Hazrat Mahal. The queen herself had put this armband on you. You were two years old. But sadly none of them is alive. They were a part of the convoy... which was attacked right here. This is destiny. The children of those graves are here... are standing before me. Which are the graves of my parents? I don't remember. I had buried them in the dark out of fear of my enemy. But I guess those two tombs... are Azim and Zohra's. I know that you've rejected all the orders... of the British government. Neither did you contest the DIA elections. Nor did you collect tax from the farmers. Or married Loi's daughter. Are you aware of the consequence of this revolt? Yes. You're queen Victoria's sworn son for sure. But remember. Don't ever trust her. She can harm if you need be. 'Like in every battle... Some fight for their own devotion.' 'Some fight for the treasures.' 'They fought only for their motherland.' 'O Motherland, your brave sons are off to do battle.' 'Give them an identity.' 'Tomorrow people will ask you about them.' 'Where did they fight and where they die? What's happening? What's happening? Firing! Someone's attacking. Firing. O God, save me. Soldiers. Tell everyone. This lousy soldier. 'What were the last words on these lips?' 'What were their last memories?' 'What scene was it?' 'What sight was it...' 'that had you transfixed.' You take care of that one. Keep firing. Turn around. Scoundrel. Ameer! After everything I've done for you… Stay back. You turn out to be just another filthy ignorant Indian. And I'm proud to be so. And you? A liar. A murderer. A butcher. I know you killed my parents. And Noor's mother. And God knows how many more poor souls. You deserve no mercy. Whatever I did, I did for my queen and country. And whatever I am doing, I'm doing it for my country. My people. 'The place they were going to with the passion.' 'With dreams and aspirations.' 'Tugging at our hearts at every step and light up the dark night...'

'The loyalists who laid their lives for their country.' 'Are long lost in the depths of time.' 'There is no mention of patriots like Ameer Haider and Noor...' 'in any history book.'
