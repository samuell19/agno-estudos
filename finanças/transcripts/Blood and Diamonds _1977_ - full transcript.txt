Hello? Marco is just leaving. He should be there in five minutes. Okay, Rizzo. I'm coming down. Marco, you're good to go. I thought you were sleeping. You shouldn't worry. I want you to relax, Maria. I'll wake you as soon as I get home. I don't want you to wait up for me, you know that. Yes, yes... If anything goes wrong, you know where the money is. Besides, you know where I'm going. The insurance agency is just around the corner. Branch number seven. I'll be back soon. - Hello, Guido. - Hi. - How you doin'? - Same old. - It should be pretty easy. - Huh? Sorry, my mind was somewhere else. I was thinking Rizzo is gonna give me 40 million tomorrow for the diamonds. He could have sent somebody else tonight instead of us. You mean instead of you. Rizzo doesn't owe me anything. Truth be told, nobody owes me anything. A man's gotta find a way to earn a living, you follow me? - Hello, Police? - Yes, go on. There's a robbery going on at insurance agency 7 in Via Giubba. Hello? Who's speaking? Who's speaking? Leave it, the cops are here. You go first. Hey! I surrender! Here's my gun! - See if there's anyone else inside! - Yes Sir! Move it! My love... Marco couldn't come. He had to make some deliveries for his workshop. - How's he doing? - Limping. Pretty badly. Dragging his leg around, ever since that night. - What about his workshop business? - It's going well. He helped me when your money ran out. The important thing is he was able to quit his old life for good. - How's your son? - Enzo works at the airport. He's got a girlfriend. I don't like her very much. - How so? - I don't know. I've only seen them together two or three times. Enzo left home right after you went to prison. Anyway, I'm sure they're doing fine. Open up, move it! Get off the bus! Off the bus, I said! Move it, dammit! Hurry up! Form a line! Line up, I said! Line up, move it! Hurry up! Don't try anything! Move it! Get out of there! Move it! Rizzo must have sent them to get me. Don't move a muscle or you're dead! Quick, throw it down! Hurry up! No... Stop! Stop the car! What the!! - One's getting away! - I'm comin' down! Guido! Go in the other room, dictate and sign your statement then you're free to go home. You too. All the witnesses stuck to the same version. Considering this, I'd say you're in the clear. I don't think the district attorney would accuse you of excess of self-defense. If he does, though, rest assured I'll put a word in your favor. I'm sorry about Maria. She didn't deserve to die like that. Can I go now? Yep, you can. I'll be in touch if I need you again. What's the hurry? We haven't seen each other in five years, after all. Hey, it's not like I'm the one who pinched you back then. I was abroad at the time, but I wish it had been me. What are you planning to do now that you're out of prison? - I'll work with Marco at his workshop. - Ah, speak of the devil. It's been five years already, so you can talk freely. I couldn't get you then, I sure as hell won't do it now. Marco was with you that night? Could you do me a favor, Inspector? I don't know where to find Enzo, Maria's son. I would like somebody to tell him about his mother. He's her only relative. I really liked that woman. You're not going back to Rizzo, are you? His days as top dog are numbered. We're about to nail him, his time's up. You'll be an old man before that happens, Inspector. No, I'm not going back to his crew. He's the one who sent those two goons to the bus to get rid of me. The two men you've killed were nothing more than a couple of small time crooks. They had never joined any outfit. - How could Rizzo be I inked to them? - He could have hired them to kill me. All right, you're free to go. If I were to believe what you just told me, well, I definitely wouldn't tell the judge that you acted in self-defense. Go now, scram. Why, our hero has finally appeared. You took your time, huh? We meet at last. Don't tell me those folks down at the police station wanted to give you a medal? I heard so much about you. I mean, not only today on the radio. Rizzo talked about you all the time. Hey, you're not actually made of steel! Boy, he's flesh and bones! Just like us mortals! Rizzo always said you were made of steel, Guido. I can vouch for that, pal! You're definitely made of steel! Only a man of steel could do what you've done! Boys, did you hear that on the radio? Well, I'll tell ya: "Without fearing for his own safety," "Mr. Guido Mauri commandeered a car which he slammed against..." What do you want from me? Big mistake, steel man. You better shut up when Tony here's talking. We on the same page? So, as I was saying: "... Which he slammed against the first bandit." Then, with the same determination, "he went against the second bandit despite the vehicle catching fire." Remember what I told you, boys? "Gee whiz, this Guido Mauri is a regular Diabolik!" But Rizzo confirmed that's the sort of man you are. Those journos didn't mention you were just returning from a stint in prison, though! Only they ever said is that you're a hero! So listen up, hero. We heard on the grapevine you paid a little visit to the police station! You and the inspector had a little chat about Rizzo, didn't you? You're not to even mention his name, pal! Aside if you're praying to him, that is! We on the same page? We on! I knew it, Inspector. I knew it would end that way. He caused that poor woman's death. He ruined her life, and ruined mine also. How many times I saw my mother grieving for that criminal... I've got a good job, Inspector, a responsible one. I work at the valuable goods department at the airport. I live in fear that one day they'll find out I'm related to that crook and fire me. Guido! You're free at last, Guido. I cried for Maria's death. Another thing we'll make Rizzo pay for. Wait a minute. Stay here. How did he behave with you? Kicked me out of his crew. Said he doesn't fancy cripples. Sent a lot of clients my way, though. Honest work, too. His cars are parked here. I fix them up personally. Every time he needs a used car, he has people call me and I find him one. It's good money, after all. Helping Maria out wasn't hard. I've helped her since your first year in the can. What do you mean help her since the first year? It means she had to work as a maid for those first months. I got by doing menial jobs here and there. I did what I could. I took anything available. You get what I mean? Old Rizzo popped up again after a while. Things took a different turn then. Both for me and... For poor Maria as well. I left her ten million to get by. They could have never lasted five years, sure. I just can't wrap my head around your first year comment. Maria never said anything, she more or less implied she was using my money. Sure, she mentioned you gave her some money, but only after she ran out of mine. Believe me, I thought she had run out of my money only recently. Did you find any evidence about Rizzo informing the police back then? No, nothing. Except for a piece of indirect evidence. I'm talking about those 40 million he owed you. At the trial the judge said the informer told the cops about the time and place. The only one who knew about them was Rizzo. You closing down already, cripple? Souping up some cars, huh? And here's Guido Mauri. You know old Rizzo chewed me out for that little visit I paid you? He said I shouldn't take any initiative against you. And he also said you're a man worthy of respect. Why, I had to tell him you talk a bit too much. He just said you'd go see him first, if you had an itch to talk. Long story short, Rizzo is fond of you. He values you. - The car ready? - Ready. Good job. You know, we have plenty of friends down at the police station. I mean, sure, Inspector Russo is a first rate wanker. Thing is, if he's trying to find out if those two crooks were part of our crew, it means he really believes your claims. And Rizzo should be informed of that. I bet he won't like you so much then, steel man. We on the same page? Chauffeur. Move it, will ya. - He's here. - Let him in. Here's the tough guy. You happy you caused her death, you murdering degenerate? I never saw my mother smile, Inspector. This criminal here made her live a miserable life! You wanted to give her a peaceful existence, and look how it ended! - Her death was an accident. - The kind that could have happened only with him! - Calm down, Enzo. - Yeah, take it easy. Let him give you that thing so we can go home. Yes, I want the keys to the house back. I know you went there, you made a big mess of it. You better not try set your foot in there ever again! Is there anything you need to retrieve from the house? Time's up, come on. Have a good day. That kid isn't entirely wrong, you know. No, thank you. We conducted a very thorough investigation. Rizzo didn't have anything to do with the bus attack. Those two crooks were looking to steal the postal service money on the bus. Scram, get out. You have never nailed Rizzo, and you never will. He's too shrewd. If he needs to take care of somebody, he hires out of town guns, he never uses local hit men. So no one finds out it was him behind the hit. - Sounds pretty simplistic. - Well, that's what he does. Hey, where are you staying at? Fat chance I'm telling you. Ask Marco if you need me. POLICE STATION Rizzo wants to see you. I'm afraid my words didn't convince him. And you should never spend time alone with that asshole Russo, mate. I guess you both get pretty fucking chatty, huh? Rizzo never said he wanted you alive, mate, understand? We on the same page? Rizzo is a true gent, he always sends a car to pick up his people. Move it. Hurry up. Step on it, chauffeur. Uh-huh, that's more like it. Okay. All right, I'll call you back. Come forward. Hello, Guido. How's life? Whatever. - What's the matter? - I don't want to talk with you, Rizzo. Fair enough. Don't talk. Prick up your ears, then. All right, they pinched you. It happens. You spent five years in the bin for it. That's a lot. A lot of time, indeed. Maybe somebody ratted on you, or maybe not. You heard in court that somebody alerted the cops, but that isn't necessarily true. Maybe somebody saw you. They might have alerted the police station, or simply a patrol car. It beats me. I don't remember every detail. There's something I definitely remember, though. I had to leave for France for six months, three days after they got you. I also remember you kicked out every lawyer I sent you in prison. And I do know that Maria never accepted the money I sent her. That's the whole truth. Pure and simple. Yet you refused to shake my hand. Without even giving me a reason for that. Well, I'll give you another chance. You were supposed to give me 40 million, the day after the robbery. So what? I found out later that the insurance agency only had two million worth of diamonds. You must have known there were only peanuts to grab, yet you still sent me. I don't remember, it's been so long. You sayin' he sent you to nick that chump change to get you pinched on purpose? All that to keep the 40 million to himself. We on the same page? Shut your mouth and get out of here. Let him stay, Rizzo. After I'm done talking, you may have to give him an order. Kill me, Rizzo. Here and now, or I swear I'll kill you the first chance I get. No, Guido. That's not the way you're supposed to talk to me. Listen up, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I don't want to see you in here again. I'm going to write you a check to cover the money I owe you. Interests included, of course. For the five years you've spent inside. I'm going to give you three days. Sort out your affairs. And then leave town. Here. All right. I'm still giving you a present, though. I'm allowing you to leave this room alive. And I'll pay my respects to poor Maria with another present. I'm still going to give you three days to disappear. And disappear you will. Tony. I'mma keep a couple boys on your tail to see where you'll be three days from now. Even if I won't be there in person I hope you'll miss me. Friendly reminder: if you're still in town on Sunday, I'll personally shoot you in the mouth, even if you're listening to the mass in St. Peter's Square. We on the same page? - You back with Rizzo's crew? - No. - Who are you working with? - I'm on my own. What's your deal? Hey, don't get offended! If you need to move some goods around, I'm your guy! But if it's a bank heist, well, good luck to you! - See you around. - Bye! You take the other way! That was great! You rock! That was awesome! - You made that call? - Tomorrow morning. - You telling Guido? - No way, I want him to stay out of this. Out!? What do you mean he's out? Guido needs an alibi. He'd be the first they'll think of, considering our relation. Now listen, you little jerk. It's the third time a shipment of diamonds has arrived at the Fiumicino airport. They're so close you could even touch them. If you let these diamonds get past you, I'm packing my bags and moving out, get it? It's three years you've been making me live like a bum, I can find another man. I'll get them this time. Good. I'll get Guido right over here. Don't worry, I'll make him a foolproof alibi. Enough talking about Guido, let's think about the heist plan. - You have to make that phone call. - In the morning. In the morning! You've been saying that for two days in a row! It's a big job to pull, jerk, and every hired gun you could get needs time to plan it out! I'll call tomorrow. I don't have the afternoon shift, I'll be free then. Tomorrow, I promise. You really mean it? You givin' out guns to anybody? You see my men being beaten up and you don't do squat! - I ain't seen nothin'. - Yeah, sure! Our guy's playing hide and seek now! You just don't give out guns to anybody. Guido ain't anybody. Of course, of course. He's not anybody, indeed. He's a freaking nobody, you hear me!? A freaking nobody! Nobody! Nobody! A fuckin' nobody! - Hiya. - Hello. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. Why, you dirty... If the state doesn't pay you enough and you want to... ...double as a mole, that's fine with me. But you tell Tony the inspector's office is off limits when I'm in there. That clear? Hey, Enzo. Lisa wants you. - Thanks. - No problem. - What is it, honey? - Did you make that phone call? I didn't have the time. Now listen, I'm gonna call you back in a few, and if you didn't make it by then you aren't gonna find me when you get home. Guido, this Sunday marks the end of the ultimatum Rizzo gave you. I know you won't comply, but you either disappear or he'll have you whacked. Sure, you can dispatch a few of his men, but it won't amount to anything. Did you take a look at Tony over there? Rizzo must have lost his marbles to have a fool like that for his right-hand man. Nope, Rizzo is still on top of things. Trouble is, there's not much choice nowadays. Sure, they're tough and know how to handle a gun, but they lack smarts. Have you planned something yet, Guido? - Nothing so far. - You have to make up your mind. - I'll do it on Sunday. - It's gonna be too late. Too late for what? Tony will shoot me on Sunday, not before. There's still time. Got a match? Just one. What are you doin', crapping? What's this, kindergarten hour? You got me a bunch of shit-flinging punks! Gimme back my money! The warehouse is always empty during lunch break. Some go eat at the cafeteria, others go out. There's some guards, but they don't check anything. The diamonds arrived yesterday. They're leaving tomorrow with the four pm flight. You're probably wondering why I didn't tell Guido. - No. - Well, the police knows we're related. And I made sure to find him an alibi. Did you prepare that yet? - You ever been in trouble with the law? - No. - A criminal record? - Neither. - Who else knows about the heist? - My woman. - What woman? - Lisa. We live together. But I only told her about the heist, she doesn't know anything about you. The folks at the police station think I'm just a miserable, recently orphaned kid. Inspector Russo almost gave me a sympathetic hug, imagine that. - Any news? - I do, Guido. Lisa called. She wants to see you. - Where's she now? - The Gattopardo night club. Yeah, I know where it is. Bye. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Well done, dear. There's room for improvement, though. Let me show you. One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! - Oh, I get it now! - Yup, that's the right way! Get ready, girls, all together now. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. - Yes, that's a well done. One, two... - One, two, three, four... What's wrong, dear? - Excuse me, I'll be right back. - Of course. Take a five, people. Hi, so kind of you to come. I had to bother the inspector to get you my message. - Two Punt e Mes vermouths, George. - On it. Let's sit down. You see, Enzo and I had a long conversation. He really regrets what he told you at the police station. I told him as a woman, if you get what I mean. "Enzo, your mother and Guido loved each other very much." He never realized you were everything for poor Maria. All right, I don't hold anything against Enzo, he's only a boy. I know how much his mother meant to him. I know what she meant to everybody. Maria told me something about you on a couple occasions. - I'm out of here. - No, wait a minute. I'd like you to make amends with Enzo. You shouldn't hate each other. Well? Will you stay a little longer? Please, Guido. Accept. Enzo gets off at one, it's twelve o'clock now. I'll ask my boss to let me off earlier, we'll have a drink and wait for him at home. - Don't say no, please. - All right. Thanks. I'll go get changed, you stay here. I'll be right back. Don't even think about leaving. Freeze! Hands in the air! - Out of the way! - Face the wall, move it! Where's the keys? Hand them over, hurry! Hurry the fuck up, I said, bitch! Don't move an inch! Be a good girl and don't try anything funny! No funny business! Quick! Let's go, chauffeur! What!? Four victims? The fuck do I care about those details!? I don't give a damn about thirty kilos of diamonds! Especially with four dead! Who? Two customs officers, a clerk and a security guard. What's the clerk's name again? Come again? Enzo Capozzi? ♫ OI' lady Assunta will do it for anything, hooray yippie... ♫ There's a kid who asked his mum about the place he came out of... ♫ And then his mum could only answer that... - Mornin', here's your stuff. - Thanks. - See you. - Bye. ♫ The mum could only talk about storks and bairns... ♫ There's too many storks flying 'round this house, 'cause... Please, try to calm down now. Where were you at one o'clock? We were having lunch together. We went home together. You can ask my co-workers, they'll confirm his alibi. He's been with me all the time. You may go now. I'll have a car drive you home. Take care of it. Come on. - See you later. - Yes. What am I supposed to believe now? What, I wonder. That you had nothing to do with the heist, I suppose. Of course, Enzo telling you about the diamonds shipment would be plausible. You might have passed the info on to someone. It would be plausible, yes. You know who done it? I don't, you're the one who knows all the specialists. Specialists who deal in diamonds, you mean? Ah, you should have asked me a few years ago. I mean, just remember all the thieves who specialized in automobiles. Same went with drug smugglers and cat burglars. Things are different now, it's just a big fuck-up! It's like watching a football game, any player can score, even goalkeepers! Call our cutter in Amsterdam, tell him we need him here within a week. After you book his hotel room, tell him to bring his family along and not a hooker like last time. You start preparing the cutting tools, we have to finish the job as quick as we can. I already got some buyers. This is top quality stuff. You got yourself a new office clerk? Huh? Oh, yeah. That kid hurt himself falling down. Head split open, cracked ribs, basically in pieces. He decided to look for a new kind of job altogether. Guess he wasn't cut for this trade, after all. You think so? - What about Enzo? - Killed him at the right moment. They'll say one of the robbers got jumpy and shot him. It's pretty believable, one of the guards tried to intervene. Nobody will ever suspect he was working with us. It's not common to get rid of informers. I'll listen to the news on the radio and keep you posted. And the woman who lived with Enzo? I'll go see her in due time, but I reckon she won't make a fuss. If she knows, she won't peep to avoid prison. If she doesn't, all the better. She does know, you better find an agreement. No! No! Please, stop! No, please! It was all his fault! Stop! - It was his fault! I didn't do anything! - Get to the point! - He said that... - Cut to the chase! I tried to warn Enzo, but he wouldn't listen! - I told him to stay away from those criminals! - The names! - He thought of you, but I... - Give me the names! I don't know! He just instructed me on how to swindle you! I know the last part too well. Now give me those names! I don't know! I really don't! Enzo didn't want to do the job with you! He said you'd be the first the cops would think of. I told him it was risky, I did everything I could to keep him out of trouble! I even told him I'd leave him! One wouldn't know it from the way you acted with me, and how you played it up at the police station. You're next, though. - What do you mean? - They know you know. Enzo was not a man who offered many guarantees. They knew right away the kind of guy he was. One who confided a lot in women. I'll talk to the inspector! Sure, go ahead. Tell him you and your man planned a heist which went south. Tell him Enzo's former accomplices are out to get you. Maybe he'll protect you. Answer the door. Open it. Good mornin'. Name's Tony, charmed to make your acquaintance. Hello, Guido Mauri. Hey, did the steel man rough you up? We've got here at the same time, but being the gent I am I let him come in first. I received a good education from the Jesuits, you see. But you seemed to be taking your sweet time, I hope you weren't about to fuck. Well? What's your opinion on this monumental piece of tail? - She on our same page? - In relation to what? Cut the crap, Guido. You didn't rough her up for nothing, did you? I guess you advised her to think things over. Or maybe you didn't? Step forward, come on. Come on. I don't know what's on your fucking mind. If you believe your man was worth a spit or not. You can die for him, or find an agreement with us. There'll be some money for you, don't worry. As long as you keep your lips sealed. Say one peep too many and we'll take care of it. Ain't that right, Guido? We're on the same page. At last! We've finally reached a mutual agreement! I'll be on my way, then. Yup, that I'll do. You know something, Guido? I keep thinking I'll have to dispatch you sooner or later. You'd never understand how much Rizzo constantly praising you irks me. Bit peculiar having to deal with a man who gets so much praise, you know. Anyhow... Go talk to Inspector Russo, if you wish. It'd be useless. They'd never be able to frame Rizzo. Your life isn't worth anything to anyone. However, if Enzo really meant something to you, feel free to go to Russo. Tell him everything. Mr. Philips, how long will you be staying in the city? Who wants to know? A gentleman from the Tourism Bureau. He's making a survey concerning Dutch tourists. Has the Dutch embassy been notified? I'll ask him. Mr. Philips would like to know if his embassy has been notified. No, I'm making this survey for our regional office. Mr. Philips, the gentleman says it's a regional survey. Well... Ten days, maybe more. I cannot rule it out. Thank you. Mr. Philips said ten days, but he doesn't rule out he'll prolong his stay. You got any idea how many fucking Dutchies are in Rome? Lots and lots of them. So far I got freaking 106. This fella's name is Philips. Olivier Philips. He's with his wife and daughter. He's our man. The fastest cutter in the business. How long will he be staying? About ten days, maybe more. Let's wait in the car. I'll point him out as soon as I see him. - Hi. - Hello, Nicola. I've got my car here. Keep the change. - Mr. Rizzo doing fine? - Yes, of course. Dammit, I'm on a losing streak tonight. I'mma show you now, yes sir... Three goons plus the cutter. Where do you want me? You go there, I'll look for the other door. Put your hands up! - Yeah, hello? - This is Philips, I've been shot. We've been attacked! I need help, come here right away! Slow down, Philips. What happened there? Yes, somebody gunned us down! The others are dead! Dead? What do you mean they're all dead!? You must come down to the villa at once! At once, you hear me? Yeah, on it! Get rid of the bodies! Serves me good for wasting time screwing whores! The world's gone crazy, I tell ya! Done. All he needs now is to keep the wound clean and change his bandages twice a day. One round just grazed him, but the other went in. You go to the hotel tomorrow morning at eight o'clock. As you order. Good night. I want you to leave tomorrow, Philips. Tell the hotel people you hurt yourself falling down. Get rid of the dirty bandages, give them to the doctor tomorrow. Nicola, book the plane tickets and a cab to get to the airport. Yes, right away. What did those two look like? You said they both have their faces covered and used suppressed guns. Anything else you remember? Our friend has noticed a very important detail, but he's not completely sure. It's just an impression. One of them was limping on his right leg. Damn shame for you today's a holiday, huh, Marco? It's Saturday, ain't nobody working. - I had some work I had to finish. - Relax, overworking is bad for you. Especially after working late last night. You must be tired, huh? I mean, sure, going bang bang isn't that tiring. I bet even carrying those thirty kilos didn't tire you out. Thirty kilos ain't nothing for an ox like you. Thirty kilos of shit would have been a different story, though. But thirty kilos of diamonds are lighter than a feather. Am I right? I also imagine you're not keeping them around here. That's Guido's task, I'm sure. Am I right? Then again, you might actually be hiding them right here. I'm not taking the piss out of either you or Guido. Now you know how things are, Marco. Where are those diamonds? Rizzo wants me to bring him Guido before the loot. He hasn't even mentioned your name, you lousy cripple. How could a gimp like you even attempt a heist like that? Listen up. Tell us where Guido and the loot are, if you fancy saving your skin. We on the same page? I'm really getting upset, Marco. I don't have time to waste. Be reasonable and I'll only give you a couple stigmata, like Saint Francis! Spill the beans, you can still get away with it! I have a third nail here to pierce your heart with! We on the same page? Well? Where's the steel man? Is this fucking Guido worth dying for? It won't even be a clean death, you cripple! He could crawl back into his mother's womb, but I'll find him anyway! You can die for all I care, but you still won't save him! I'll get him no matter what, you cripple! You lousy cripple! I'll get him! I'll get him! You did what? What!? What the hell have you done, Tony!? You didn't have to kill Marco! No, you better listen to me! I want you to go down to the police station, our new informer just told us Guido is there. Do what you have to do, but don't lose your damn head, understand? Keep your cool! That animal... It's clear somebody wanted some answers from Marco! But what, exactly? Goddammit, Guido, answer me! You better ask Rizzo. No! I'm asking you! Marco managed to stay out of trouble for five years. He did his job as a mechanic only, and I know because we kept an eye on him! And we also knew he took care of Rizzo's cars! No more than four days after you walked out of jail and the guy dies! And it's your damn fault he croaked! Maybe it is, but I didn't kill him. Stop taking the piss, Guido. You got the nerve of saying it wasn't your fault because you didn't kill him! What's the fucking matter with you!? Two and two makes four, just as Marco's dead. And you're next now. Guido, you realize we might be seeing each other for the last time? Tell me something. - You couldn't understand. - Just try me, then. I know, period. Tell me everything you have on Rizzo. I'm going to nail him. What did he do to you? Did you do something to him? You take one step out of here, Guido, and you're a dead man! If you don't have a reason to hold me any longer, Inspector, I'd like to leave. Where you been, you lousy bastard? Begging your inspector friend to help ya!? No one's gonna save you! You're done for! Done for, I tell ya! Coming, Tony! How are you, Lisa? Can I stay here for a little while? Tony will be here any minute. No, he's going to take his time. - Pour me a drink. - Sure. Yes. Those diamonds. You wanna see them? Please, come in. This way. Inspector, what a nice surprise! Come in, make yourself at home! You know Mr. Venier, my attorney? Why did you come all the way down here? Well, I don't have enough elements to have you come down to my office. So I decided to pay you a visit and have a friendly chat. If you had called me first, Inspector, I'd have come down to your office. - Well... - My client is a very busy man, Inspector. - Of course, of course. - Indeed. Let's get on with this friendly chat, shall we? We shall without further ado, yes, especially concerning the Fiumicino heist and Marco's death. The fellow who owned the garage where your client stored his cars. Well, I suppose you're wondering why I've I inked the two things together, huh? Not at all. My client isn't interested in the topic, and he's not wondering anything. - Oh, but I had a hunch considering... - My client isn't a curious individual. Stop riding my ass, Attorney, will you? You're acting like a giant pain in the ass, dammit. I've had five murders in a single week. The five I know about, I mean. I know how these things are, so I'm positive the tally'll be higher. If your client isn't a curious man, well, too bad I definitely am. And I'm not here to play either. Ask your questions, then. I'll tell you what's on my mind first. I think Enzo's killing was deliberate. Enzo? Marco? Who are you talking about? - Can't you even give us their last names? - Told you to stop riding my ass, Attorney! I ain't got time to play here! Rizzo knows damn well about those two gentleman's last names. - And you do too. - Of course I do. At long last! Still, me and my client would like to know the reason behind your friendly visit. You keep saying you're not playing around, and neither do we. If you have some facts to present, well, go ahead. As a matter of fact, I have a precise fact. Straight from Guido Mauri's mouth at that. He told me Rizzo here was behind the bus attack. - Guido Mauri? - Never heard of him, huh? Doesn't ring any bells, right? Guido Mauri. I even gave you his complete name, after all. He's also the stepfather of that Enzo kid killed during the Fiumicino heist. And best friend to Marco, the murdered garage mechanic. The first five murders plus two more makes seven in total. And if we add Maria it makes eight murders, Attorney. So Guido told you I was the one who sent those two crooks to hold-up the bus? Did I hear that right, Inspector? Did I? Yes. I reckon those five years in prison must have confused him. The whole thing is absolutely preposterous and ridiculous. Yet he didn't make up that you threatened to kill him, right? No, no, I never did. Quite the opposite, actually. It's Guido who threatened to kill me, Inspector. I've got nothing against him, believe me. I believe you know we were good friends. Of course, you also know I have the right to defend myself when threatened. I don't think my client has anything more to add, Inspector. You should have come here with better facts and actual proof. In that case, feel free to formally ask us to come down to your office. Oh, I'll be pretty formal, yes sir. No proof, no case! I guess I came down here for nothing! No point in talking things over, I bet. What the fuck I came down here for, I wonder... So, what are you up to? Wanna go to bed? Hold it. Well, if this isn't a nice surprise... Who's this slut siding with? You or me? Heh. You it is, I guess. No one is in with me. Except for Marco. Marco died a good death. He didn't even say one word. Not one, I swear. He on your same page, I guess. Yeah, definitely on my same page. That guy had plenty of guts. I felt bad killing him, because I realized how it feels like killing a man worth his salt. It makes your heart ache. Close the box. Well? What now? Do we keep standing here like statues? You really keen on dealing with me gun in hand? Are you old school or not? I've been mentored by Rizzo just like you. Then you didn't I earn squat. The reason I didn't kill you before was only because you seemed harmless. Every time you tailed me I knew exactly where you were. I could have just turned a corner and put one in your mouth! You looked pretty pathetic. I hoped to find you at the villa when we took the diamonds. You got lucky. Put the gun down. Put it down! Still deluding yourself, aren't you? You looking for a fistfight? Guido, the one who turned you in that night was Enzo. He had stolen your money and was so scared of you finding out. Maria never told you that she didn't find the money, because she loved her son too much. She realized it was Enzo who turned you in. That's why she kicked him out, because she loved you. - Then Rizzo had nothing to do with that. - No. Hello? That you, Rizzo? What is it, Guido? The diamonds are yours. Give me a place to deliver them. - You know the old slaughterhouse? - Yes. I'll be in building number five. See you there at one. All right, at the slaughterhouse. Building number five. - I'll remember it. - Okay. All good, they're all here. I was wrong about everything, Rizzo. Yes, you were. But it's not just a matter of being wrong about me. You also went against me. You didn't even attempt to talk it over. As if it wasn't something we could have straightened out between us. And all for what? For these diamonds? - You know it's not about the diamonds. - I know! Yes, I know that perfectly well. I know your opinion on this whole story. And you killed a lot of my men to prove it! You also got newspapers all stirred up, and fraternized with the inspector! I was wrong about everything, I told you that. Yeah, and we can all make mistakes! But you made yours without any honor! That's why you're here to die. And you know why I'm talking to you and I agreed to meet you here, instead of having you gutted in some lousy shithole? You know why, Guido Mauri? Because I want all of them to know, and to I earn, from you and me. I want them to see how they should behave since they've chosen this life. To I earn how to act with honor! Anything I can do for you? I've already taken care of your friend Marco's funeral. Anybody you want me to call? No. Any relatives you wish me to send money to? Anything at all? Shoot him. I want you to kill me, Rizzo. Don't put an executioner between you and me. I'm sorry, Guido. I really am, but you aren't the same man anymore. We both know it, otherwise you wouldn't have come.
