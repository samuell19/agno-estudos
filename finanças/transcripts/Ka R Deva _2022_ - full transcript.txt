(Birds Chirping) Uncle, I want balloons. (Water Sloshing) Huh! Hey, you will fall. (Grunts) (Alarm Clock Ticking) Oh no! I am late again. It's already 9:30 AM. Mom, I'm already late. Give my lunch. Yes, it's done. Wait a minute. - Hurry up. - Here it is. - Thank you. You are always in hurry. Wait. Let me cut it for you. - No. - Have your breakfast. 'No, I'll eat something in canteen.' This has become your routine now. (Anklet Chimes) Dad, see you. What was your mom saying? Nothing. She wanted me to eat breakfast. But I'm already late. I'll eat at the canteen. - Dad, can I go? - Yes. (Crow Cawing) Vaishu, are you ready? - Wait a minute. - Hurry up. - We are late already. - Yes. (Birds Chirping) Let's go. - I hope we haven't miss the bus again. - No, it's just 10 AM. - 10 O'clock! - Yes. (Temple Bell) (Tyre Screech) Bandya, hurry up. You fool. Don't push me. Vaishu, I didn't push you. Boys, why are you yelling? You old lady! What is your problem? Everyone else is quiet. What's your problem? Boy, I am getting my ear operated. My ear is hurting. Hey old lady! Old people should roam in an ambulance... ...not in local buss. Hey child, I am your grandmother's age talk properly with me. Listen, my grandmother died. (Laughs) - Don't mess with my head. Go there and do whatever you want. - What? - Vaishu... I will be back. Grandma, come with me. Sit beside me. - Three of us. - I'll get your luggage. She is here. 'Mother Teresa of our village.' (Laughs) - Vaishu, shift. Let her sit. (Tyre Screech) Bandya, Vaishali came into my dreams. She accepted my love. - 'Economics.' - What are you saying? - Go, propose her. She ignored me. Go and ask her. Propose her but don't get involved. - Go. - Vaishali. - What? - I want to say something. Be quick. I am getting late. I really... ...li... Li... Li... "Li... Li... Li..." You ugly guy! Why did you stop me if you'd nothing to say? Useless. Moron! What is the matter, Vaishali? Why are you angry? Om, look at Mirinda. He said he wanted to say something but now he's stammering. (Birds Chirping) Let it go. I apologize. You can go. Let's go. You won't change! Look at him! He said, she came into his dream. - What happened? - Nothing. Who was he? - Him! - Yes. - He was his friend. - Does he belong to our village? - Yes. He's different. He's good at studies. He is a simple boy. (Laughs) Om, Mirinda is acting smart these days. Nandya, stop talking nonsense. I... I... I... - School! - I like her from school days. You like her from your school days... ...but, dude... ...she doesn't like you at all. What are you doing? Keep quiet. Don't advice us. Fine! Laugh it out. Laugh out loud.... (Bell Tolling) Let me warn you... I'm here with you because we are together since childhood. I am not like you. I stay with you to keep you sane. Got it? - Hey, what are you doing here? - Huh? - Didn't you hear the bell? - Yes, sir. We are going. - Let's go. - Hurry up. (People Chattering Indistinctly) Aren't you hungry, Vaishu? Janu, science is a boring subject. I almost slept. Almost! You slept well. Vaishali, you would've got punished if I hadn't woken you up. That's why you are my best friend. - Yeah. - Thank you. Hmm! (Whistle) O ma'am! I am Sangram. Sangram aka Pittya. He is my assistant-Shirpa. I am Janhavi's maternal cousin. We are going to have a family discussion here. It would be better if you would leave. Pure Marathi! Vaishu, leave right now. - Am I right, boss? - Right. - Vaishu, wait. You don't have to leave. Sangram, I've warned you not to trouble me. Trouble! Am I troubling you? Janhavi, listen to me. I like you. You would say this is your college. Don't have this misunderstanding. Not only Malharwadi... ...but this college fears me. Sangram, you must leave from here right away. - Otherwise... - You're driving me away! You are free to think. If you won't leave right now, I'll complain against you to dad. Janu, I am not scared of dad... I'm leaving because you're unhappy. Janu, you are driving me away... ...and I will never forget this. - Huh... - Let's go, Shirpa. Let's go, boss. Vaishu, have a seat. What do I do about him? I don't understand. He spoiled my mood. (Phone Ringing) Oh no! Sampatrao is calling. He will annoy me now. - Yes, dad. - You fool! Where are you? Dad, I came to the college to meet Janhavi. Great! Did she accept you? No, dad. She is acting smart. What nonsense! Aren't you ashamed of this situation? I rule this village... ...and you can't impress a girl. She's the only daughter of a millionaire. Impress her and enjoy your life. You can many options later. No one will question you. Impress her. Dad, everything will be fine. Don't worry. I am there if you fail. My sister won't let me down. - Right? - Yeah. Hang up now. Sister, your daughter will become my daughter-in-law. (Engine Revving) Madhuri... ...how did you reach here? Nothing, sir. I came here to give him lunch. - Where is he? - He is inside. Madhuri, you upset me. Why? What happened, sir? How dare you ask me this? I have a small demand. It's a win-win situation for both of us. - Am I right? - Why are you talking nonsense? If my husband will find out about this nonsense... ...it will be a big mess. - Huh! (Laughs) There won't be any mess. No one will know about it. Sir, give this lunch to my husband. I'm leaving. What have you got for lunch? Let me see. Leave me. Sir! Hey! Hey! Sir, did Madhuri get my lunch? Yes, she did. She left. Okay. It's past 1 PM now. Can I have my lunch? Do you come here to have your lunch? Wait for a while. The truck will be here by evening. We've to dispatch the new material. Grocery store owner is giving good money. What about the old material? We will sell it. Big deal! - No one will know it. - Yeah. Get 2 old sacks out for sale. - Bring old sacks only. - Okay. Okay, sir. (Crickets Chirping) This dough has become rubbery. We've to instruct the flour mill owner. Mom, what's his fault? Dipali was saying that the wheat isn't of good quality. I think there is a problem in the flour mill. I suspect he must have ground wheat over sorghum millet. Mom, it's Mr Sampatrao who has done a scam. He sells all the good material to grocers... ...and gives us bad quality food. You should keep quiet. Don't tell this to anyone. No. Why would I do that? Don't tell this to anyone. Otherwise we won't get the food at all. Ganga, get me some water. Sune, get water for your father. You have no presence of mind. (Utensils Clinking) Are you studying? Yes, dad. My exam will commence next month. - Huh. - Huh? You lived at a hostel for 5 years. We didn't feel complete then. All of them were here. But we didn't feel complete. Right? But now that you are back... - I feel better. - Dad, honestly... I also felt lonely there. I missed you, mom, and Sune. I missed you guys. I had decided... ...to earn good marks. Om. You are our pillar. I mean, you... ...should get education. I want you to become a successful man. I will work hard for this. I'll help you complete your education. - Am I right? - Yes. Yes, dad. Can I continue with my studies now? Yes, go ahead. Ganga. Hurry up. Yes, I am making flat-breads. - Hurry up. - Peel that garlic quickly. - Yes. (Crickets Chirping) Mirinda. Om doesn't hang out with us at night. I am sure he is st... - Studying? - Yes, he must be studying. (Laughs) Mirinda. You should give me a fixed salary. I always restart your stuck cassette. - Qu... - Quiet! - Yes. - Otherwise I will beat you up. - Yes. - Did I interpret you right? - Yes. You're laughing at me. An astrologer told me... I'll stop stuttering after I get a girl. You fools! Why are you laughing? - Look at him! - I'm on a highway. '-Hey moron!' Who is there? Hey, no one is there. Sakhya, it's only you. Go straight. I won't go straight. I will walk crisscross. Who will stop me? See, I am walking crisscross. See, I am not walking straight. - You will fall. - Hey! - See, I'm walking crisscross. - Hey! Hey! He fell down!... (Laughs) Let him be. No one forces him to drink alcohol. He earns a lot at Sampatrao's shop. What nonsense? His children roam around bare-clothes. His life is stable because of sister Madhuri. Only she could handle him. No other girl would've stayed with him. Nandya, Sampatrao has robbed this village. We don't get a good quantity of rice anymore, like before. No one can complain against him. The village head is in his favor. The assistant village head also favors him. Nandya, once Dadasaheb will know about it... Sampat will get beaten up. No, Bandya. Dadasaheb won't beat him up. He is his brother-in-law. Let it be, Nandya. This politics is none of our business. - Hey Mirinda, get some fuel. - We will burn it. No way! We've to attend the college in the morning. Let's go. - Let's go. - As if we study very hard. Let's go. (Birds Chirping) - Mom. Mom. - Yes. My bus pass expired. I don't have the money. Go and ask your father. Okay. - Dad. - What? My bus pass expired. I need 300 rupees. Om, I don't have the money right now. Do one thing. Buy a ticket for today. I'll manage something for tomorrow. Okay? I will see you. Take this. Go safe. Mirinda, why doesn't Om come with us to the college? He goes to the college by first bus in the morning. - He is intelligent. - You are right. More sir. More sir. - Yes, Om. - I heard, you won't take lectures. Yes. Principal sir has given me some work. That's why I won't be able to take lectures for 3 weeks. Yes, but exams are in the next week. A lot of portion is pending. I know. But I am helpless. Work is important. Right? Yes, sir. Sir, I tried doing it by myself. But eleventh chapter is very difficult. Please can you teach me? Sorry, Chavan. It is impossible. Sir. Can you spare some time from your lunch break? I can come to the staff room. Okay. You can come to the staff room in the afternoon. - Okay. - More sir. Please teach us the chapter. It's difficult for us. Are you happy now? Guys, I can't manage it. - Sorry. - Sir, wait a minute. Sir, you can teach this to Om. He will explain it to us. Please. This is an important chapter for exams. - Please sir. - Okay, fine. Om, you can come to me in the afternoon. Okay, thank you sir. He was requesting sir. Why did you interfere? Sorry, Om. Thank you, Janhavi. Why are you thanking me? You'll have to teach us later. Of course, I will. (Music Overlap On Dialogues) Bandya, Om is enjoying college. Yeah, man! We never spoke to a girl since we joined the college. But he has started teaching them. (Laughs) Om is here! - Hey! - Let me sit. - Yes, sir. Oh! Sir! What? You returned early from the canteen. We didn't return early. You are late. Sir, are you done with your lectures? That chapter is very difficult. I didn't realize the time while I was teaching them. I didn't know, you understand this subject so well. What do you mean? Stop acting innocent. We've seen your communication without words. You are misunderstanding me. Forget about it. I won't be able to come to the college from tomorrow. Why? My pass expired. Buy a ticket. I bought a ticket today. How will I manage to get the money for a ticket? Don't make us awkward. I will buy you a ticket tomorrow. You will buy one for me. - How long will I be dependent on others? - Yeah. I was thinking... ...of starting a part-time job alongside college. Yes. That's the best option. You manage your work. But I'll buy you a ticket tomorrow as decided. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Janu. Sangram is sitting there. (Crow Cawing) Let him be, Vaishali. Don't pay attention to him. Ignore him. Oh ma'am! Wait for a minute. Janhavi, listen to me. This isn't your college, nor a lodge. Tell me. Will you marry me? Sangram, get out of my way. Got it? Answer me and you're free to go. No one will stop you. Speak up. Sangram, I don't want to marry you. Am I clear? Just wait and watch. Your parents will get us married. - Shirpa, let's go. - Yes, boss. (Engine Revving) 'Mirinda.' - Let me slap you! - Oh no! Janu, don't worry. Nothing will go wrong. - Good morning, students. - Good morning, ma'am. I am here to talk to you guys. Those who haven't paid their fees of second semester... ...should pay it in next two days. If you fail to pay it... ...you won't be allowed to give exams. Please note this. Do you get it? I will be back. - Ma'am. Ma'am. - What happened, Om? I haven't paid my fees. Pay it tomorrow. Ma'am, I have some financial issues. Sorry, Om. This time principal sir... ...is very strict about the fees. You have to pay the fees tomorrow. Ma'am, it's a matter of a week. I'll manage it. Om, I can't help you in this. Sorry. You have to pay the fees tomorrow. - Please. - I am really sorry, Om. 'Ma'am. Please listen to me, ma'am.' Vaishali, you are special to me. I got this special chocolate for you. Why did you get this? - It's Mirinda's birthday. - It's his birthday. I don't want it. Keep it to yourself. Hey, he's giving you with love. Take it. - Janu. - Huh. This is called Mirinda! (Chuckles) Vaishali, Mirinda is amazing. Janu, why are you making fun of me? I didn't mean it. But he is good at heart. Forget about Mirinda. When is your birthday? My birthday is gone. Why are you upset talking about it? - No. - I mean we don't celebrate my birthday. Dad doesn't like all this. He thinks we lose one year. We celebrate that day. He doesn't like it. So we don't celebrate it. Forget about your dad. I am your best friend. When are you giving me a party? Party! Today. We will have a party after college. (Horn Honks) Janu, we will be late because of this party. Don't worry. I'll drop you home if we will be late. - Okay. - Have a seat. Janu, we could've gone to the college canteen. You wanted to eat puffed flat-bread and curry. It's the famous dish of this restaurant. - What did you do, Janu? - Well... This is the way to place an order here. Janu, wait a minute. I remember something. Mirinda gave me a chocolate today. I told you it must be having Mirinda's number. Vaishu, I wanted to speak to you. I feel bad for Om. I want to do something for him. But... - He is different. - I agree. I feel he's the best guy in our college. Yes. I'll wait. If he won't propose me... ...then I will propose him. I really like him. Om! You! Water bottle. 2 plates curry-flat-breads. - Is this your order? - Yes. You work here as a waiter. What else do you want, ma'am? Nothing. Vaishali. Is this true? Janu, this is not a dream. He works here as a waiter. I don't understand what he is up-to. Vaishali. Om is a strong man. I like him even more now. Ma'am. - Good morning. - Good morning. - What is the matter? - Here. - What is this? My fees. Today was the last day. Om! Your fee is already paid. - My fees! - Yes. Who paid my fees, ma'am? I didn't tell anyone about it. Your loved one has paid it. They've asked me to keep their name a secret. Okay. But I have the money now. Please tell me their name. I want to return the money. Sorry, Om. I can't disclose the name. Ma'am, please don't refuse. Tell me. Sorry, Om! Ma'am, please listen to me. Janhavi, thank you. - For what, Om? - For this. What is this? You paid my fees. I'm returning it to you. I don't know about your fees. I know. Dixit ma'am told me about it. You paid my fees. I felt really good about it. I have the money now. I'll feel better if you would take the money. Please. Thank you. Janhavi. Thank you once again. It's okay. "We are slowly getting involved in each other. It's magnetic." "Your look makes everything mesmerizing. I feel happy." "We are slowly getting involved in each other. It's magnetic." "My free heart is now getting attached to you." "You are my life." "Your smiling face makes my morning bright." "You are a fresh breeze for me." "I jump with joy every-time I see you." "We are slowly getting involved in each other. It's magnetic." "My free heart is now getting attached to you." "You are my life." "Our love is blooming slowly like a bud." "Your intoxicating eyes gets me goosebumps." "I want to be with you." "We are slowly getting involved in each other. It's magnetic." "My free heart is now getting attached to you." "You are my life." "I feel happy every-time I look at you." "My impatient heart awaits meeting you." "Your love is as soothing as a feather." "We are slowly getting involved in each other. It's magnetic." "I lose myself every time you look at me." "My life is filled with happiness." "We are slowly getting involved in each other. It's magnetic." "My free heart is now getting attached to you." "You are my life." "My free heart is now getting attached to you." "You are my life." (Water Sloshing) (Birds Chirping) Will you speak? - Tell me. - Is your mood off? - No. Nothing. What is the matter? Did I do anything wrong, Om? - Why are you quiet? - I didn't blame you for anything. Nonsense. Tell me. What is the matter? Have a look. Wow! Om, you topped CET exams in our district. You got selected for MBBS course... ...in government college. You've a great news. Why are you sad? I don't know anything. I want a party. Janu, please. I am not going for it. Why? Why won't you take it up? This is a golden opportunity for you. Why are you leaving it? I know this is a great opportunity for me. It's a dream of me and my family... ...that I should become a cancer specialist. Do you know? Thousands of people die of cancer everyday. But you've to complete MBBS and become a doctor. Only then you can fulfill your dream. What is your problem? Problem! My life is full of problems. My father works very hard. My mother struggles. But we don't have enough money for my studies. Dreaming is free. But we need money to fulfill these dreams. Om, don't worry. Don't worry at all. I'm sure this problem will be solved. Om, do you know? I came here to tell you something. - But we forgot about it. - Tell me. Let it be. Your mood is off today. Janu, tell me. Don't add in my worries. No, I will say it on some other day. Will you say it now? Let's go if you don't want to tell me now. Wait. I will tell you. Om, my parents have done a lot for me. They gave me immense love. They gave me every thing I wanted. I always feel I should have... ...someone to share my joys and sorrows. I want to do my best for that person. Om... ...don't get angry. You are that person for me. I really like you. Will you be my life partner? I love you, Om! What is the matter? Tell me. We are together since a few months. Our exams will get over in 4 days. We will go to separate classrooms. We might go to different colleges. I don't want to lose you. Om, please. Say something. Janhavi. You are right. I agree with you. - But... - What, Om? Janhavi, sorry. I want to focus on my studies. I don't want to get involved on all this. I want to complete my education first. Let me become a doctor first. Then we will think about us. - Please. I hope you understand me. - Yes. Honestly, your thoughts are different than others. This is a great thought. You will become a doctor in 6 years. Your dream will come true. I want you to be with me. I will wait for you. Janhavi, honestly... I really like you. But... I'm bound by my family's dreams and responsibilities. But I won't force you to wait for me for all these years. Om, promise me. Our friendship won't get affected till we are together. 100 percent. Let's go. We are getting late. Janu, why do you want to go to the temple today? Yes. I forgot to tell you, Vaishu. Om topped the CET exams in our district. He got selected at a big college for MBBS course. That's why we are offering this coconut to God. Well, I proposed him yesterday. - What? - Yes. What did he say? He rejected me. Honestly... ...his rejection was acceptance for me. Okay. Handle it. (Crow Cawing) Janu. - Is that Om? - Dad. - Have you meal quickly. - Yes. Om! Janhavi, you! Om, you gave lunch to someone. Who was he? He is my father. Why? Do you remember? When we were kids, a girl was running away with balloons... ...and she fell down. You applied something to her hand. Yes, I remember it. She was a cute girl. Janhavi, you know she still appears in my dreams. I tried to find her. But I failed. How do you know all this? Om, I am that small girl. I still that incident in my dreams. We are in the temple. Don't hug here. Sorry. - Let's go. - Should we go? - Yes. (Inaudible) - Janu. - Huh. Let's go. We are getting late. I shall leave. Om, what about your college fees? It's 100,000 rupees. Don't worry. Dad and I are trying our best. We will arrange it. I will also try my best. Okay. Bye. (Chuckles) - Have tea. - Yes. Wow! It's very tasty. Dad, do you remember? I fell down while I was carrying balloons. - I don't remember. - Try to remember. Once your chappal broke. You went to a cobbler to get it stitched. You gave me money to buy balloons. I fell down while carrying balloons. One boy then did first-aid for me. I don't remember all this. - What is this, dad? - Try to remember. - Okay. - What about that? - Dad, that boy is in my class. He topped the CET exam in our district. He got selected at the government college for MBBS. He'll go to Mumbai for further education. Dad, at that time you said... ...he will become a doctor. 'Don't remove this herbal paste.' 'Really? Okay.' 'Khandu, make him a doctor.' - 'Yes, Dadasaheb. - He's intelligent. - Yes.' Tell me if they need any help. Is he the son of the cobbler Khandu Chavan? - Yes. Yes, you are right. I remember this. He stood first in the district. We were going to felicitate him on behalf of the village council. Dad, he got selected. But I doubt if he'll go there for studies. Dad, he has to pay 100,000 rupees fees. He doesn't have enough money to pay fees. Dad, can we help him? He is an honest guy. He will return all the money. Is he your friend? Yes, dad. He's a good friend of mine. Okay. Let me see. (Dialer Tone) Patil, it's me. Do you know cobbler Khandu's son? What's his name? Om. - Omkar Khandu Chavan. - Yes. We've to pay his fees. 100,000 rupees. Pay it from my account. Please look into it. - Are you happy? - Yes. Yes, dad. Mr Patil will pay his fees. Don't worry. Ask him to be ready to move. Yes. Dad, honestly... ...thank you very much. - Dad, can I go? - Yes. (Phone Ringing) - Hello, Om. - Yes, Janu. I have a big surprise for you. Meet me at the river back right now. Surprise! What surprise? How can I say it on the phone? You come here. I'll be waiting for you. Okay, I will be there. - Bye. - Bye. (Water Sloshing) Janhavi, what's the good news? You called me urgently here. Do I need to have a reason to call you here? I thought if I would call you here casually... ...then you wouldn't come. But my father has paid your fees. Dad has paid your fees. Janhavi, is this true? I can't believe it. It's true. I said to dad... ...if we can pay Om's fees. Dad called his secretary the next moment... ...and asked him to pay your fees. I don't know how to react to this. My parents have worked very hard all their lives. I feel now their dreams will come true. Om, become a doctor soon. I want to see you as a doctor. Sure. Stop. Stop. Boss. Boss, our river bank has become a lover's point. Look at them. A couple is sitting there. (Crow Cawing) - She is mine. - What do you mean? You fool! It's Janhavi there. She is with Khandya's son Om... Let's go and break his bones. How dare he get romantic with my sister-in-law! Wait. - I want to destroy him completely. - Yes. Why should we blame others? My lover betrayed me. Bro, we've to play a smart move now. We have to make a move in a way... ...that we hit 2 targets without getting involved in it. Get my phone and call Dadasaheb. (Inaudible) Dadasaheb is here. Come Dadasaheb. Uncle, look at Janhavi and Om. Uncle, if you don't believe me... I hope you at least believe yourself. No, Sangram. I don't want to see this again. You should never take an action when you're shocked. It might ruin everything. Wait for a few days. We will see what we can do about it. Water. - Wait, I'll get you some tea. - I don't want it. What is the matter? Did someone say anything to you? I failed as a father today. Our daughter has grown up now. She has grown up so much that even sky isn't enough for her. I saw her in Om's arms. What are you saying? Sandhya, our daughter betrayed us. I knew it. She spoke to me nicely... ...and asked me to pay his fees. Sandhya, we have failed as parents. - She did what she wanted to do. - Don't blame yourself. I will speak to her. Sister, you hadn't been going through this if she was mature. Tell me. Who should she stay in touch with? How to behave? She isn't a kid anymore. - How do you know about it? - What do you mean? - Sangram must have told him. - Yes. Look! Listen. This is not outside our family. Sister, we are family. Before she elopes with someone, let's get her married. No one has to worry about it. We will be free. No. I agree with you. - She has finished her 12th grade. - Yes. We should get her married. Yes, that's what I suggested. Yeah, well... ...now that we are talking about her marriage... Let me speak my mind. Okay, brother-in-law. Listen. - It's a matter within the family. - Yeah. Instead of her getting married to a stranger and have problems... I suggest you to think about Sangram. Right, sister? Yes. You are right. You know Sangram very well. Let's get them married. The matter will stay in the family. - Right, Dadasaheb? - Yeah. But Sampatrao... But? Sister, what do you think about it? It's good. Rather than sending our daughter in a stranger's family... ...she would stay close to us, in the same village. - Right! Brother, I suggest you to find an auspicious day for engagement. - Let's get it done. - Let's get it done. No. Don't rush things. Let me... Let me think about it. Om also lives in the same village. I will look after him. Don't worry about him. Once Sangram and Janhavi will get married... ...then I will handle him. - Sister. - Yes. He is right. No. I don't want to rush things, Sampatrao. I need to think more about it. You're free to think. I've no objection. She is my niece too. Once you'll accept the proposal, I'm ready to serve you. We will get them married soon. Sister, what do you think? - You're right. - Dadasaheb, you think about it. Think about it from all sides. Sangram is a nice guy. I shall leave now. Yeah. Sister. - Convince him. - Yes. See you, Dadasaheb. See you. Think about it. (Engine Revving) Om, you will move to a big city. City life is very new for us. Take care of yourself. Have your meals on time. Call me at least once in a day. Janu, obviously I will call you. I will miss you. You came into my life unexpected. You've given me more than I could imagine. You are leaving... ...now it will really bother me. - You can't imagine my pain. - Don't worry. It's a matter of a few years. I'll come back whenever I'll get a chance. Yes. Anyway. I have always been waiting for you. Now I'll wait for you as your bride. Okay, my bride. But don't imagine me with a garland... ...in a wedding alter... ...but imagine me as a doctor sitting in my cabin with a stethoscope. (Chuckles) Honestly Janu... ...not only for my family's dreams... ...but for you, I've to complete my education. Janu, I shall leave now. Janu. Mr Ghodake, 19th of this month is an auspicious day. Sangram and Janhavi's astral charts are a perfect match. - There won't be any problem in their marriage. - Nice. Mom, what is going on? I will be back in 2 minutes. Mom! (Sobbing) What is this? Dad, Sangram isn't the right guy for me. I don't want to marry him. Who is the best guy for you? Om? Speak up now. Why are you silent? Dad, he is not the right man for me. I have to complete my education. Dad, give me some time. I know Sangram isn't the right man for you. But who will tolerate your immoral behavior? - Please, dad. - We'd a great lineage. How dare you ruin our good lineage with a poor guy? We pampered you too much and you got spoiled. Now you'll marry Sangram. That's final. Dad, Om is the right choice for me. Dad, he's the most intelligent guy in the college. Janhavi, what nonsense are you saying? - Keep quiet. - You keep quiet. We are suffering because we pampered her. Janhavi, mark my words. You're getting married in next 8 days. Cry your heart out now. Dad, please. Please. "God, please don't separate us." "This is a game of destiny." "No one could understand this game of destiny." "No one could understand this game of destiny." "God, please don't separate us." "I am crying my heart out. God, how can you see me in pain?" "God, how can you see our love suffer?" "How do I live alone now? Why am I suffering through this?" "God, please don't separate us." "I have no hopes from life." "I walked the path of live only for you." "I cannot tolerate the pain of separation anymore." "God, please don't separate us." "How long should I live life against my will?" "Our dreams are shattered now." "I can't live this life anymore with this pain in my heart." "God, please don't separate us." "No one understood the game of destiny." "God, please don't separate us." (Thud) Dad! Doctor, is there anything serious? There is nothing to worry about. The wound is not serious. She lost some blood and so she got unconscious. You can take her home within an hour. Let her take bed-rest. - Yes. - Yes. - Dadasaheb. Collect her reports after 2 days. After 2 days. Doctor, she's getting engaged in 2 days. I won't be able to come here. No problem. Collect the reports once you get time. Okay. Fine. - Greetings. - Greetings. Greetings. Welcome. Have a seat. - Greetings. - Greetings. Hey! (Phone Ringing) Yes. Tell me. Right now? Okay. Stop this. Stop all this. I don't want my daughter to get married. No way! Dadasaheb, this was wrong. I am sorry, Sampatrao. I don't want to discuss this matter anymore. What did you say? Sister, did you hear him? You don't want to discuss this anymore. He humiliated me in front of all the villagers. Look what he says. He doesn't want to discuss about this. I tried to save your dignity as a family member. But your husband has attacked on my dignity. He doesn't want to even discuss about it. Dad, I don't care about them. I want to marry Janhavi only. Do you want me to beat you up, moron? What? You want to marry Janhavi! You too dance and sing 'Janhavi. Janhavi.' We don't want to share any kind of relationship with this betrayer. We don't want to see your face again. Do you get that, sister? Don't you come back to me to beg for your dignity. Get up. Let's go. What are you waiting for? Brother, don't do this to us. Let's go. (Crickets Chirping) Dad. - Janu. - Yes. What? Dad. Do you know? Today is the best day of my life. I know. This situation has troubled you a lot. You have done a lot for me. I am very happy. Take this. I will never say no to you. Janu. When is your birthday? My birthday! Dad, it's in the next week. It's 4 April. (Laughs) We will have a big celebration. Invite all your friends... ...on that day. Okay? Invite Om. Okay, dad. Dad. Go to sleep now. It's too late now. - You go. - Yes, dad. I will sit here for a while. I will come later. Okay. Sleep early. Can I go? Okay. Dad formatted my phone. Oh! Yeah! I shall call Vaishali. (Crickets Chirping) Hello, Vaishali. - It's Janhavi here. - Janu, is this the time to call? Sorry. - Speak to me for 2 minutes. - Tell me. Vaishu, it was my engagement today. But it got canceled. - What are you saying, Janu? - Yes. Dad got to know about Om. That's why I couldn't call you in all these days. Did dad hit you? Yes. A lot of things have happened. I'll tell you everything once we will meet. Vaishu, dad has formatted my phone. I don't have Om's number now. Please help me get Om's number. Have you lost it? Your dad will beat me up too. No. Don't worry about that. Dad asked me to call Om. Please do something. 'Vaishu, do one thing.' Ask Om to come to my place on the 4th. All of you're also invited to my place. We will have fun. Okay. Okay. Take care. Take care. - Bye. - Bye. Hello. Hello, Mirinda. It's me. Who me? Are you teasing me? Let me sleep. - Mirinda, Vaishali here. - Oh! Vaishali! Slow motion. It's Vaishali here. Listen to me. I've some work with you. I can die for you. You moron! I don't want your life. I only want Om's number. Didn't you call me to talk to me? 'I called you.' - Just wait and watch. I will call Om in the morning. Mirinda, don't call him in the morning. I won't be able to answer any call if dad will be awake. Message me Om's number. Okay. I will do it. (Dialer Tone) Yes. Yes. - Hello. - Om, It's vaishali here. - Vaishali! - Yes, - I took your number from Mirinda. - Okay. Tell me. - Om. - It was Janhavi's engagement today. - What? Yeah. But it got canceled. Don't worry. - But... - It's her birthday on the 4th April. - She has invited you. - But... Will you be there? (Claps) "Mood is fresh. We feel energetic to dance." "Mood is fresh.

(Vehicle Passing By) (Birds Chirping) Mother, is Om here? - Who are you? - I'm Dadasaheb's daughter, Janhavi. Okay. Please come inside. No, I am getting late. Where is Om? Did you pay his college fees? Yes, I did. - Where is Om? - He has gone to the city. He left to catch the early morning bus. - Okay. See you. - Hey! Have some tea. - No, I will come later. - Hey! Janu. What is this? Why didn't you tell me last night... ...about your departure? The afternoon bus got canceled. That's why I'd to leave in the morning. I got to know it in the morning. - Sit. - Whatever it is. I can't live without you even for a moment. I think our love will kill me someday. Janu, please stop talking nonsense. What if you will leave me? I can't concentrate there. I feel like I should look at you, talk to you. Yes, that reminded me... ...save your number in this. Dad deleted all the numbers. Save your number. - Here. - Call me whenever you'll miss me. I miss you every single moment of my life. Janu, don't get upset. It bothers me. But we have no other option. Our education is important for the future of our love. We've to stay far for a while but everything will be fine. By the way, when we go to see-off someone... ...we have to have a smile on our face. Smile now. (Tyre Screech) Thane. Mumbai. Let's go. Thane. Mumbai. 'My daughter looks pretty when she's happy.' Dad, where are you going? I am going to our farm house. Rama has some work with me. - Would you join me? - Yes. I get bored sitting at home, dad. - I will come with you. - Okay. - Lets' go. - Yes. Sir. Rama! - Sir, you are here. - Yes. - Sir, can I say something? - Yes. We grow a plant with all the love. We spend our life taking care of it. When that plant blooms with colorful flowers... ...we feel satisfied. Am I right, sir? Yes, you are right. We take good care of the plant... ...but sometimes God has some other plans for us. ...can damage the plant... ...that we raise with love. That's why... ...the plant that we've planted in the garden... ...we should keep giving love to it. - Right? - Yes, sir. What happened? I asked you to sleep. Priya, why did you come out? Why are you being a fool? Dad, I didn't see you. - That's why I came outside. - My child. Sir. She has high fever since 2 days. Doctor said he can treat her. But I need 300 rupees for this. Sir, I need some money. (Birds Chirping) I am obliged, sir. Let's go, my child. - Hello. - Yes, Janu. - What are you doing? - I am studying. I've come to the farm house with dad. I got bored at home. 'It's your day-out today.' Yes. (Cicada Chirping) Mom, when will dad arrive? Why do you need your father? Jayashree's and my uniforms are torn. Children tease us because of torn clothes. But we should ignore them, my child. Let them tease. What happened? What happened? What do you mean? Don't you get it? She is sitting on my way to home. Warn her. I just kicked her toy. If I find her sitting on my way again... I will break her bones. Why do you drink alcohol? You've ruined our family life because of alcohol. I feed you and now you're taunting me. Dare you teach me anything again. I'll kill you. I'll kill you and your kids. Got it? You ruined all the fun. - You morons! - What! Oh no! (Sobbing) (Phone Ringing) - Yes, Janu. - Om! Don't you miss me anymore? No. Not at all. Really? Don't you really miss me? Have you lost it? We speak on the phone all day. I should forget you in the first place to miss you. It's true. Tel me. What's up? Nothing. I am completing a project. I have a submission. Listen to me. Can I speak to you later? No, Om. You always give reasons to hang up on me. You never call me back. I keep waiting for your call all day. I really have to study. No, Om! Study later. Speak to me first. Will you give me 2 minutes? I'll finish this and then speak to you. Vaishali. How did you come here? I came here to meet you. I went to dad's office so I thought to meet you on the way. I am glad you came here. Did Om call? He always give excuses and hang up on me. He said he will call later. I have told him. He should speak to me first, then he can study. - Janu. - Yes. - Don't you think... ...you are doing wrong with Om? What nonsense, Vaishali? You struggled... ...to send him to the city for his studies. Now you keep calling him all day. Why are you distracting him from his goal? But he speaks to me for only 5 minutes in a day. He studies for the rest of the time. What's wrong in it? This is a lie, Janu. He must be missing this 5 minute call all day. He must be thinking about your moods and talks. He might be thinking about you all day keeping aside his studies. 'Hello. Hello.' 'Janu.' 'Hello.' 'Hello.' - Hello. - Tell me. We will speak later. - Concentrate on your studies. - No way. Speak to me. I won't be able to concentrate on my studies. Om, we will speak later. I am busy with some work. Okay. But call me back soon. I am waiting. Vaishu. I am sorry. I didn't realize it. I might affect Om's studies. Janu. Don't get upset. Now you have realized it. Vaishali, tell me. What do I do? Om shouldn't get distracted from his dreams. He won't. Just do as I say. Don't repeat this mistake. Stop calling him. - But... - He has got used to you... ...and you have to break it. It's okay if you would speak to him sometimes. - But... - I know, it's difficult for you. But try your best. It's going to be difficult for both of you. Bare a little pain. Yes, Vaishali. Come what may! I want Om to be a doctor. I won't call him again. Okay. Janu, shall I leave? I have a lot of work at home. "I gave you love beyond my capacity." "I am longing to meet you." "My life..." "...is dedicated to you." "My love..." "...you are like my breath for me." "The lamp went off." "O..." "The lamp went off." "I am attached to you." "My life has..." "...become lifeless." "Why, God?" "Why, God?" (Crickets Chirping) (Laughs) Hey! Who are you? Why are you laughing like this? Who am I? Om, didn't you recognise me? I am your conscience. - I'm laughing at myself. - My conscience? Why are you laughing at yourself? Well... I know a poor boy. His father works very hard. His mother is waiting for him. They have big dreams. You want to become a doctor. But he... ...he's wasting his time talking to a girl. No. - I'm concentrating on my studies. - Really? You are going crazy for her. Do you remember you've an exam in the next week? Enough. I won't call her again. I won't get distracted from my studies. I will concentrate on my studies. Thank you. For guiding me. Me! Not me. You have guided yourself. Okay. Start studying with new energy. Girls, be quick. Don't you want to go home? It's past 5 PM now. Okay, ma'am. (Birds Chirping) Hey! - Are you sorting wheat? - Hey! - Yes. - Collect money from a shopkeeper. - Okay, sir. I'll leave now. - You can get the money in the morning. Okay, sir. Send someone to pack lentils. What is this? Why didn't you tell me this before? It's their time to leave. Ma'am, I am not done yet. I will do it. Okay, pack it. I will be back. Welcome. This way. (Door Close) Madhuri. Hey, Madhuri. How long will you leave an unsatisfied life? How do you love that drunkard? What's so special in him? Tell me. Does he satisfy you? Your kids are also unhappy. Your kids wear torn clothes. Hey! Hey, Madhuri. What happened? Hey! What is this? Come here. Come here. Sit here. Sit. Madhuri. Don't cry. Hey! Listen to me. Let me wipe your tears. Don't cry. Listen to me. I'm ready to wipe your tears with the money. I am being honest. You have to please me. I will give you money. Am I right? I have a lot of money. You will get everything. Did you hear me? Don't over-think. Think about your kids. Think about your kids, and not about yourself. What? Are you ready for it? Madhuri? That's like my girl! Nice! Janu. What happened? Nothing, dad. (Clock Ticking) Dad, can I go? Sit here for a moment. How long will you be upset with me? Whatever I did... ...was not for my benefits. I did all that... ...for our Janu. Forgive me, Sandhya. In future... ...it would've bothered me if I'd hurt her. I could not see her in tears. Fine. Don't blame yourself. Honestly... ...our decision to get Janhavi married was wrong. I... I didn't think about her. I became selfish. Whatever you did... ...was absolutely right. (Sobbing) - I made a mistake. - No. It wasn't our mistake. The situation was difficult. Many things have happened. Yes. She was right. Om is an intelligent boy. Honestly Sangram was not the right person for Janhavi. All of that was worthless. Don't think about the past now. We will handle it later. Uncle, is Janu home? Yes, she is at home. She just went in her room. - Okay. - Have tea. No, aunt. I just had tea at my home. - Okay. I will meet her. - Okay. (Birds Chirping) Yes, ma'am. You are enjoying old memories. Yes, Vaishu. I was missing college days. Isn't it nice? Yes. - Vaishu. - Yes. - Our college days were a bliss. - Yes. Janu. Did you call Om? No. I didn't call him since that day. He too didn't call me. He didn't call you! He said he has a lot to study. I think he couldn't manage to call me. Om's exams will get over soon. He will be back after his exams. Vaishu, honestly... I am waiting for that day. I miss him a lot on some days. I somehow manage my emotions. Janu, it's a matter of a few days. You'll spend the rest of your life with him. You have to do this for now. Janu, this is the real test of your love. Yes. Okay, I shall leave now. Take care. I am good. But I miss him a lot. It bothers me. But it's better... ...that I have switched off my phone. So that he won't call me... ...and I shouldn't call him either. Okay. I shall go now. Take care. (Horn Honks) Sorry, Janu. Maybe... ...you're upset that I don't talk to you anymore. I really miss you. Janhavi, what are you thinking about? Nothing, mom. Mom. I have troubled you and dad. No, Janu. We have realized our mistakes. You are free to live your life. We are always with you. I didn't mean it, mom. I was going to tell you and dad about Om at the right time. But the right time didn't come. I should've told you and dad about Om. It's okay, Janu. It's about your age. Om is the right choice for you. Both of us like Om. Honestly... ...your dad said... ...we will take the decision at the right time. Thank you, mom. I am serious. You understood me. (Laughs) Come on, have tea. I will go now. I have to cook lunch. - Okay. - Yes. 'Om, my parents are ready for our marriage.' 'You should know it.' 'You deserve to know this.' 'I can't take it away from you.' (Grunts) Janu! Janu! Janu! Janu! Janu. Sandhya, look at her. Janu! Ambulance. (Machine Beeping) - Sister, did this patient move? - Not at all. Doctor, what has happened to her? Nothing, Dadasaheb. We are giving her right treatment. She will be fine. Janhavi. My child. See, she is getting conscious now. - Sandhya. Sandhya. - Come in. - Janhavi. Come on. Janhavi. Mom. Dad. You will be fine soon. Don't worry. You will be fine. - What? - Uh... Vaishali. I will send her. Let's go. - Janu, we are here to take home. - Is Om... ...back home? He will. We rushed to the hospital so we couldn't think about it. (Vehicle Passing By) (Phone Ringing) 'Hello, Om.' - Yes, Bandya. Om, come back soon. - Janhavi... - What? What about Janhavi? Speak up. Janhavi is admitted to the City hospital. - Why? - She fell from the stairs. - Come back soon. - You calm down. I'll be there soon. - Cut the call. I'll be there. - Okay. (Inaudible) Dadasaheb. I have removed the life-support. We have tried our best. Now only God can take care of her. (Tyre Screech) - Bandya, where is Janhavi? - She's inside. Dadasaheb. Dadasaheb. Calm down. Janhavi will be fine. It's too late. I am guilty. I did wrong to all of you. Sandhya. You. All of you. I hid this from all of you. Forgive me. What are you talking about, Dadasaheb? What happened to Janhavi? What happened to her? Why are you silent? What has happened to Janhavi? Tell me. Janhavi has cancer. She is nearing death. This is a lie. You are lying. Say it. You are lying. Sandhya, this is a fact. This is the truth. Janu will be fine. You're lying to me. (Sobbing) I got to know this on her engagement day. I wanted to tell this to all of you but... I couldn't muster the courage. That's why... I called off her engagement. I did everything in my capacity... ...to make her happy. Listen. Why didn't you tell me this earlier? Her cancer was at the third stage when we found out. There was no cure. I approached all the hospitals. She had got only few days to live. I could not tell anyone about it. (Sobbing) No! No! No! Janu will not succumb to this. Om! Om. You are here! You are back. I knew it. You'll come to see me after you'll know about it. You have proved... ...your love for me. Now I will die... ...happily. No, Janu. You will be fine. I won't let you suffer. We have... ...many dreams together. We've to fulfill those dreams together. We... ...have to get married. We've to celebrate our nuptial night. There will be only you... ...and I... ...in a decorated room. We will have two beautiful kids. A cute daughter like you. Payal. One intelligent son like me... Veer. I lived this life in my dream now. Forgive me, Om. I couldn't be with you all your life. These dreams will remain dreams now. Don't think about it. I am here with you. Always. We would have made a great pair. I would've loved you beyond anything and everything. You would've loved me to the moon and back. - Right? - Yes. Janu! Om. Take me in your arms. Yes. Come on. Come on. Janu! Ja... Janu. Janu. Janu. Janu. Don't leave me alone, Janu. Janu. You wanted to see me becoming a doctor. Don't leave me alone, Janu. Janu. (Sobbing) Janu. "Why, God?" Janu. "Why, God? My love..." - "Why did You snatch my love away from me?" - Janu. Janu. "Why, God?" "Why, God?" "Why did You snatch away my love from me, God?" "Why did you took my life away from me?" "Why, God?" 'My parents have done a lot for me.' 'I always feel there should be someone to share...' '...my joys and sorrows with.' 'I really like you.' 'Will you become my life partner?' 'I love you, Om.' "You taught me to love. Now you've left me alone." "How do I live without you now?" "I have lost my mind. Everything feels empty now." "You taught me to love. Now you've left me alone." "How do I live without you now?" "I have lost my mind. Everything feels empty now." "Every-time I miss you..." "Every-time I miss you, this pain is heart-wrenching for me." "Why did You take away my life from me?" "Why, God?" (Thundering Clouds) 'I can't live without you even for a moment.' 'I think...' '...one day our love will kill me.' 'Janu, please don't say this nonsense.' 'How will I live without you?' (Ambulance Siren) "How do I hold myself? I don't see anything to live for." "How do I express my sorrow? You left me alone." "How do I hold myself? I don't see anything to live for." "How do I express my sorrow? You left me alone." "You have left me." "You have left me." "Something is burning inside me." "Why did You take away my life from me?" "Why, God?" "I am also in tears. I lived and died for you." "I sky fell down on me. I was longing to meet you." "I am also in tears. I lived and died for you." "I sky fell down on me. I was longing to meet you." "At this point in life..." "At this point in life, all my dreams are shattered." "Why did You take away my life from me?" "Why, God?" "Why, God?" "Why did You snatch away my love from me, God?" "Why did You take away my life from me?"
