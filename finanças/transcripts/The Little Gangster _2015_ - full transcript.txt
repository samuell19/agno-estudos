A cool Father is strong... ...and has tattoos. He can save lives... ...tame tigers... ...or is an excellent driver. Have a great day at school, son. But my father is none of that. 'Chess Tournament' He's weak... ...clumsy... ...forgetful. And he's incredibly gullible. Can I borrow your phone for a sec? Yes, of course. Certainly. The access code is zero zero zero... ...two. I'll wait here. See you later. Not quite the Casanova. With a father like that, you will get bullied. Hey, Rikkie. My mom passed away. My dad hasn't changed the house since. He doesn't like change. And most importantly: he cannot stand up for himself at all. 'Dork' As you can see, we're the losers in town. I wish my mom was still alive... ...but that's not what this story is about. This story is about my father... ...and how I turned him into a mob boss. LITTLE GANGSTER Oh, Son of Don is airing tonight. Cool. Bummer, I'll be at the chess club. What is Son of Don? A movie I saw at the cinema back when I was studying. What's it about? -The mafia. What is mafia? An Italian gang who threaten and murder people. Very exciting. Perhaps a bit too exciting for you. Won't the police arrest them? Yes they will. No. Actually they won't. Because the mafia is very powerful. The police can't even get to them. That's how it is. I can record it for you. Sure, that's a good idea. But don't watch it. It's too scary for you. Okay. I'm off. Sleep well. Bye. I must have set it to the wrong channel. Oh well, never mind. Paul Boskamp. No, we were... You've got the... No. No, that's okay. Yes. No, well... We really don't need a juicer. Just send me an invoice. Perfect. Bye. Those telemarketers always know how to persuade me. You're out. Move it Rik. We'll let you out after the vacation, loser. 'Beef All right. Good day at school? -Not really. Good. I got a promotion today. Oh, that's horrible. No it isn't. It means you'll earn more money. But in our case it also means we'll have to move house. Really!?? So I must decline. -What? Why? We don't want to leave. We'd have to pack everything. -That's no problem. You'd have to go to a new school. Nobody likes that. Chances are that we'll be disappointed. Let's not disrupt things. Hey, Rikkie. 'Kick me' Can you pass me that file? Hand it to me. Thanks, Paul. Paul, I'm very glad you accepted that promotion. L--- They're anxious to see you. You can start next week. Isn't that something? -Great. Looking forward to it. I'm sorry. Are you talking to me? I don't see anybody else here... So you're talking to me? You better walk away. Do you know who my father is? My father is a Mafia boss. You can put a blue sticker on the boxes we'll take with us. We'll throw away the bags. I don't know when I'll be home. I'm not sure how long it'll take. Maybe they'll give speeches. I hope not. We'll see. 'Dorks'. Wow. What an awesome place. Yes it's very... I don't know. Can I have this room? -Sure. May 2nd, 14:35. Fahrenheit Lane number 52. Dog turd. Possible perpetrator: Mrs. Aarding. So you're the new neighbor. Yes, we are. We just... We just moved in. It wasn't a question. It's a quiet neighborhood and we'd like to... ...keep it that way. My son is always quiet. If you keep quiet too, you'll have nothing to worry about. Goodbye. This one's nice, dad. Or this chair, we must have it. A bed with a fish tank. For in my room. Can't we just go home and keep our old things? They gave you money to buy new furniture. That's true. It's not nice to use the money for something else. Exactly. Okay. You know what? You take care of it. I'm going for a coffee. So? Yes, it's quite different. Nice, isn't it? -Yes, very nice. Look, a dog. Tropical fish, 2 meter long tank. And our own cocktail bar. I'm sorry, are you talking to me? I'm not sure, but I think I put my good clothes in the garbage bags. Isn't that strange? Well, this will do for now. I think it looks great on you. Really? -Yes. I hope my clothes made people happy. And yours too, by the looks of it. Beware' Get off the street, moron. Sorry. Everything here is the best Italy has to offer. Pasta and gnocchi... ...risotto, portabella, pesto... ...and the best espresso. He's my brother. Anton. He won't bite. He's not completely normal but he's really sweet. It seems he wants you to have it. Thanks. How nice of you Anton. Can I help you? We're checking the property. The owner wants to know its value. Why? -it'll be on the market soon. It will not be on the market soon! How dare he go behind my back? Give me that. Tell Mr. Hidding if he wants me out, he can tell me in person. Are you gonna buy something or not? You said you had no money. Didn't you tell us that? 'I don't have money on me'. It's not mine, it's my mother's. Oh, it's your mommy's? Who cares. What do you want? A spot on the jungle gym? There's one available soon. I'll let you go if you put him down and give him back his money. Or else my dad will come and take care of you. You better move on or you'll end up next... Now. Thanks. Nobodys ever done that for me. It's no big deal. I'm Noah. -Rikkie. I'm from Italy. -Oh? That's Anton. My bodyguard. Did you move into that house with the large windows? Yes, that's us. I have to go. Dinner. We're having red cabbage. Don't Italians always eat late? Yes, very late. What do you eat? Potatoes. Do Italians eat potatoes? No, of course not. Normally we don't. But my father wanted to try it. We never had it before. Never. They're okay. Better than red cabbage. I really have to go. Bye. Ciao. 'Food bank' Leave a message after the tone. Clever salesman who sells me a subscription to Motorcycle Madness now. And like this we won't even hear them. Dad, we're all out of food. Oh? That's weird. I can do groceries tomorrow. -That's a good idea. Tonight you can order Chinese if you like. No, I want pizza. Fine. I won't eat here, I'll be at the chess club. There's a rapid night and I want to check my competition. Very exciting. The sun is shining. They sky is blue. We're not home. What a pity for you. Leave a message after the tone. You have reached the answering machine of Rikkie and Paulo Boskampi. We're not in at the moment. Ciao. Hi, pizza Margherita. You can keep the change if you help me. You have reached the Boskampi's. We're not in. Ciao. No, it's not good enough. What would it sound like if it were a real mafia boss? This is the answering machine of the Boskampi's, you sons of guns! You better not call back. Ciao. I have something for you. Because you helped me. Wow. Thanks. -You're welcome. Come in. Would you like a Virgin Bloody Mary? -Yes, okay. That's my uncle. He talked to the wrong people. Now he only talks to the fishes. Have a seat. That fell of a truck. Hello sir. -Hi guys. This is Noah. -Nice. I'll be upstairs working. Somebody is coming to see me later. Okay? Shall we go outside? But you said you can't leave without your bodyguard. Anton has the day off so we can't go far. Okay. ...and they say he drinks a lot. -Oh? Who? That man from down the street. Shall we sit here? -Okay. There's something I must tell you. It's a secret. So you have to promise you won't tell anyone. I promise. My mother is dead. She was killed by a car bomb intended to assassinate my father. Somebody wanted to kill your father? Yes, but my father is no ordinary father. My father... ...is a mafia boss. All the other bosses want to kill him. That's why we're here, hiding. Ciao. Do you put your dirty shoes on the sofa at home? What if everybody does it? The floodgates would be wide open. He used to be a policeman. What's with the cheeky look, you little brat? Why don't you show some respect? Come on, get lost. Moron. Nobody can beat the mafia. Not even the police. He'll find out soon enough. Nice. Is this lemonade? -Yes. Carbonated? -No. My favorite. It's a bit... There's a lot of wasps. -Luckily I love animals. Cheers. Listen, I was thinking, perhaps... I thought so too, but that won't work. Oh, a wasp. You're not kidding. Sjoerd? Are YOU okay? Oh no. Rikkie, call an ambulance. Stay with me, Sjoerd. I'll come and see you soon. He had a debt with my father. What? Pay your debts or suffer the consequences. It's best to keep friendly with him or else. I explicitly warned him. Hi. It's a small effort. Welcome to the neighborhood. -Thank you. Better to have a good neighbor than a distant friend. Karel, keep mowing. Bon giorno. -Bon giorno. Who's that? That's Gina from the maf... From the Italian deli I went to yesterday. That explains all the pasta. She's nice, isn't she? Say... That monster won't crap all over the place again, will he? He seems so normal. -Who? Mr. Boskampi. Your neighbor. -The mafia boss. Wait a minute. Mafia boss? What are you talking about? We witnessed how he cold bloodedly killed someone. In cold blood. Killed? Well, he was still alive. -Yes, he was. I assume you reported it? I'm more careful than that. I won't meddle in. It's best to stay friendly. -Exactly. Always report such things, understood? And now take your shit machines somewhere else. That looks delicious. Gina gave me the recipe. -Gina? Delicious. I mean nice. So Gina is a good cook? -Yes, very good. Her husband must like that. Gina doesn't have a husband. She's attracted to bad guys. So now she's done with men, she says. Enjoy your meal. -Buon appetite. Hi Rikkie. -Ciao Noah. What's in your lunchbox? Cappuccino. Isn't that coffee? You didn't let me finish. I don't bring bread to school. Italians never eat bread. We only drink cappuccino. Nothing else. Wow. My parents won't let me drink coffee. I wish we were in the same class together. I have to run. Y cue 'm m; shim. No lm not, this is my chair. Oh really? My name is written on the bottom. Do you need help finding it? Maybe you should take off your glasses. There's nothing here. Hi gorgeous. Can I borrow this? Now there is. Thanks gorgeous. Boskampi. B-O-S-K-A-M... I'm telling you, he's not in our records. Hi Fred, are you here for a job? I hear the supermarket is looking to hire a security guard. Maybe you can find out which crime organization... ...was responsible for that stolen toothbrush. What a great joke, really funny. Top notch. What if I give you his picture? Maybe that'll help your search? I could already be in trouble for sharing this with you. You're not allowed to be here, you know that. Take some rest, enjoy it. Perhaps that supermarket isn't such a bad idea after all. How can I enjoy some rest when you don't do your job? A criminal lives in my street and you don't even know who he is. Im not going down that road again! We don't know if it's a criminal. I suggest a 24 hour surveillance. I suggest that next time you call 911. Leave me and my team alone so we can catch real crooks. Thanks. Hans, listen... -Goodbye Fred. Good morning. Ah nice. You all had a good vacation? Yes sir. A new face. You must be... Rik Boskamp? -Rikkie Boskampi. Here it says Rik Boskamp. I'd know my own name, don't you think? It's Rikkie Boskampi. Are you sure you don't want to come? It's beautiful out there. All the flowers are blooming. I don't have time. Doctor Polak said a walk would do you good. Sure. Bye. Rikkie, can you point out your birthplace on this map? No I can't. Why not? -it's not on the map. I'm from Italy. Yo Rikkie, pop a shot, come on. This'll be great. -With one hand in the basket. What was that? -It should go in there. Are you serious? -it wasn't even close. In Italy they only taught us boxing. With bare hands. Sometimes we had to do 100 push-ups. In Italy you must know how to fight. To protect yourself. Okay, let's play dodge ball. Dave and Jaap form their teams, Jaap can pick first. I'll pick Rikkie. Rikkie, you're out. No, my foot crossed the line. So it doesn't count. My fault. Right. Who the hell is that? This is Anton. My bodyguard. He was in the car with my mom when a bomb exploded. He survived but he never fully recovered. On my command he'll break off all you arms. Hey, there's Noah. -The biggest dork in school. He still wets his bed and has zero friends. Except those other dorks in 7th grade. Dorks attract dorks. Exactly. I have to go. Ciao. -Bye... Anton. Hi Rikkie. -Hi Noah. How was your day at school? Everybody is very nice. I made lots of new friends. Want to come to my house? Noah gave me this. No don't. Not with your hands, these splinters are sharp! You can clean it yourself. Hi. Hi. -Hallo. They say their basement is stacked with money. Drug money. Hey, new neighbors. Let's have a look. That goes upstairs. Let's go. Here you go Mr. Boskamp. I also included that list you requested. That's very kind of you Sonja. Thanks. How was your day? Fine. Why don't you let the police handle this case? I am the police. No you're not. Not anymore. Dr. Polak rang. He said you didn't visit him yesterday. After years of good service you make one bad judgment call. One' Gama. And they immediately write you off as some kind of mad man. Well I don't think so. I don't think so. I'll call Dr. Polak and tell him you were sick. But that you'll be there the next session. 'Leave Paul Boskampi alone. He's protected by the mafia.' What's this nonsense? Hey, wait a minute. 8:10. Suspect is leaving the premises. Hi Paulie, hows it going? You forgot something, pal. Are you a colleague of Paulo Boskampi? -Paul Boskamp? Yes. So he's using a fake name? Smart, very smart. I'm with the police. I'm working unda cuffa. Excuse me? Unda... cuffa. Undercover? -Undercover, yes. Can you give me some information about Paulo Boskampi? About Paul? He's a wuss. But besides that he... Don't get fooled by his appearance. This man has connections with the underworld. I need to find out how he operates, before it all gets out of hand. This man belongs behind bars. Well? Sorry, I don't think I can help you. This man has already made two victims. Do you want more to follow? Your wife, for instance? Or perhaps you? I don't know him that well. But I'll let you know if I notice anything suspicious. Would you like to write something in my poem diary? Yes, of course. If I can find some time. But I'm sure I will. Everyone, let me introduce your new classmate. This here is Roderick. Can I go to the bathroom? Why are you in the hallway? -I need to go to the bathroom. It's that way. It's taken. -What's your name? Rikkie Boskampi. -So you're Rikkie Boskampi? I've been trying to reach your father. Our records say your name is Boskamp. But I keep getting that darn answering machine. Tell your father to immediately contact the school. Yes. And I don't want you roaming the hallways. -No, I won't. 'laxative' Where did you live in Italy? -Well... Hi Rikkie. Did you fall into a jar of grease? Do you know what I missed most? This. Man, Rikkie... Tell him who you are. You know you just signed your own death warrant? My What? Things are different here. One more joke like that and you won't live to tell the tale. Yeah but... l'll--- He craps his pants with fear. I think I need to puke. 'The coffee is free but time is money' I brought you coffee. Sugar but no milk. Just how you like it, right? 'Hit me' Thanks? -You're welcome. Anytime. Hello. -Hi dad. Spaghetti? That's how we do it. -Give it back. Nice jacket, Noah. -Belong to your girlfriend? Are you tired already, Noah? -Give it back. We're not done yet. -Come and take it. Why don't you grab it Noah? Some exercise will do you good. Ciao, Gina. What's wrong? Today I have fresh pesto. Would you like some? I didn't bring any money. -That's alright. It doesn't matter anymore. There's not enough customers. My cousin screwed up the administration. All I can do is close the shop. -What? No, you can't leave. I'll help you. I don't know how you can help me. I'll think of something. Hello. We come to fix your faucet. This is the problem. My dad left money for you. Okay, great. Hi dad. -Hello. Dad, Gina is in trouble. There are not enough customers so she has to close the deli. That would be a pity. This is my father. I like your jacket. -Thanks. He's my little brother. We're going to collect money for you all over town. What? Rikkie said you had some financial trouble so he came up with this idea. That way we can raise money and advertise your shop so you can stay. That's very sweet of you. It's a mess. I have a 4000 euro tax debt because my administration doesn't add up. I can help you with that. Yes. My dad is the best bookkeeper in the world. Exactly! Well... I'm pretty good with numbers. Shall I have a look at it some time? NOW? Or some other time. -Now. Now please. This is the wrong VAT percentage. And your turnover is incorrect. Here it says 1409, so the next page will be 1602. Yeah...see. So if this goes on like that... Who made this mess? -My cousin, Marco. Careful with that. You know what? I'll take these and get them in order. And I'll make an arrangement with the tax office. Thank you Paul. -Thank you. Itll only take an hour. Two hours. Bye. Is something wrong? -No. We... I... Could you spare some money to save Gina's Italian deli? Money? But of course... Let me see what I have. That's to pay for the order I placed. I'll look in this cabinet. -Give them that. That's my mom's. -That's fine. But she's still alive. -Who cares? This is all I have. I don't have more at this moment. If you come back tomorrow I'll have more. This is more than enough. Oh, and don't forget to visit Gina's Trattoria. We'll mostly certainly go there. Well, that was easy. We're collecting money for... Hello. Do you have some cash to save Gina's deli? You have a lot of nerve. -If this is an inappropriate time... Here's what I'll give you. All yours. I'd rather flush my money down the toilet than give you one penny, pal. I don't think he's willing to donate, dad. Nojokes. I'm watching you. 3862 euro and 20 cents... ...two watches, pearl necklaces, earrings, golden necklace... five golden rings and two golden teeth. It's an absurd amount. Gina will be very pleased. I'm so happy with this news. I had a lot of new customer today. Sometimes people must be told there's more than the supermarket around the corner. Thank you Paul. You're welcome. Here's to two delicious men. Salute. Hey Stinky, did you forget your diaper? Very funny. What do you want? -I heard youre a good fighter, Rikkie. I'd like to see that. He's a boxer. With his bare hands. The Italian way. Am I right, Rikkie? You don't look like you can fight. You don't look like you can learn. And yet you're in school. I'd like to see you fight. -I only fight in a boxing ring. I don't think you've got the guts. -Sure I do. Then show us. Yes, punch Noah. If you can't beat him, you can't beat anyone. Punch him. Maybe you're scared? Perhaps you made it all up? Come on. -Just hit him. Show us what you've got. Noah. Wait. How long do you think you can keep on lying? Im gonna tell your friends the truth about you and your father. I wonder if theyll continue kissing your butt? They won't believe you anyway. -Are you sure? What if I show them these pictures of you and your dad? But there's a way to make these disappear. Get me 50 euro and they're yours. If you don't, these will be spread all over school. Loser. Who's your father? What's his business here? He's a bookkeeper. Don't lie. He never hurt anyone. Really. I heard different stories. Stories my dad doesn't like hearing. This is our turf and we don't like competition. My father wants to meet yours. Tell him how we do things around here. I'll tell him. We expect to see him tomorrow? Our place. I'll send this car to pick him up. Understood? This bread is great with pesto. My pesto. Grandmas recipe. With olive oil, salt and pepper. Have some mozzarella. Oh wait, I have none left. I'll check in the back. Thank you. Ciao. I don't want any mozzarella. But Mr. Boskampi made it clear that we have no choice. They're all the same, those Italians. When they opened shop I said I didn't want them here. And now it turns out to be a mafia front. Dad? Gina called and said there's a problem with the money. She wants you to come over. Problems with the money? What problems? I don't know. She just wanted to see you. I'll go there now. Can you manage on your own? See you later. 'Closed Rikkie said there are issues with the administration? No, and I didn't need your kind of help. Did something go wrong? I'm trying to improve the image of Italians. And then some macho Dutch guy ruins it all. Goodbye Paul. This is Verkerk, can you give me commander Cornelissen? Yes I'll hold. Hi Hans, this is Fred. No wait. Listen. I have a code green for you. No really, trust me. You haven't seen anything like this before. I promise you. What about the photo's? Oops, I forgot them. You promised. Give me those pictures. I think I'll hang on to them. I might need another 50 euros next week. Where do I get that kind of money? -That's not my problem. You. Come with me. Noah thought you were his friend. I really regret it. -l should certainly hope so. Go home now and get me one of your parents before recess. Or I'll send child care to your door tomorrow. What? Your dad wants me to go to school and pretend I'm your mother? That man has totally lost his mind. Why are you so angry with him? Because he's a crim-... All my life I've been surrounded by guys like him... ...and I'm tired of it. My dad is different. Sorry sweetheart, but I want no part in this. There's something I have to tell you. Oh really? You've got something to tell? What a coincidence. So do I. Look. This is Rik's father. I stupid bookkeeper. I have to... Marco senior wants to see you. A stupid bookkeeper? -What a joke. These are for you. I don't know why you're angry with me but I'm sure you're right. I think. I have no idea what it's about but I do want to say lm sorry. I want to stay away from men like you, all you bring is misery. Men like me? I thought you were different but you control the entire town. Everybody is scared of you. Scared? Of me? Yes, of course. No one challenges the mafia. What are you talking about? Everybody talks about you being a mafia boss. What gave them that idea? 'Your son's school called. You must come immediately.' Very good. Yesterday I expected to see your father. He obviously has no respect. Obviously he's looking for trouble. He's a very sweet man who did nothing wrong. Your crocodile tears won't save him. That ship has sailed. Mr. Boskampi, I presume? So you finally decided to come. Where's Rikkie? -I wanted to ask you the same. Why? His classmates say your colleague took him home, without a doctors note. What? This allows me to oversee everything. Can you rewind that? What, Gio? -You know him? I do. He works for my cousin. And next time I'll need a doctors note! I didn't do anything. It was all a lie. I swear. I don't believe you. Who does your father work for? And who might you be? I'm his father. Let him go. Now. How dare you scare my son like that. Are you crazy? Acting the tough criminal whilst bankrupting your cousin's business. You... You are the worst bookkeeper I have ever seen. Well... I am sure there are worse. Nope. The worst... ...ever'. Sorry. Police! Stay where you are! Hold on. That's the wrong one. It's him we're after. This is a misunderstanding. Mr. Boskampi, you're suspected of illegal trade... ...extortion, assault and murder. Sorry Fred. That's my line. Mr. Boskampi youve... Oh never mind, carry him off. So... I bought everything. I wish I didn't but I'm not good with telemarketers. Gosh. After hearing both your stories and reviewing the evidence... ...I can conclude only one thing... ...and that's that youre innocent. Innocent? Wait a minute. What about all that money and his connection to Marco senior? Not now Fred. You can go. We'll make sure everything gets back to you. And we offer our sincere apologies. Hang on Hans... -it's all right. Wait guys. We can't let him go. He works for the mafia. You'll have something to explain later. Don't let him go. He's with the mafia Hans. Stop them. You incompetent... Do I have to do everything myself around here? Halt. Stop them. Damnit. Stay where you are Stay where you are! Why did you scare so many people? That's not very nice of you. It's your fault too. -What? If you weren't so scared and clumsy and forgetful... ...we wouldn't be bullied. All I wanted was a cool father. Me, a mafia boss? Don't be scared. Sorry. I should have never hit you. My father isn't a mafia boss. I made that up. I made it all up because I didn't want to be bullied again. You were bullied? Yes, all the time. Take this. It's yours. Thanks. Tomorrow lm telling the truth at school. You're really going to do that? -Sure, why not? Well I thought maybe we can use it to our advantage. A cool dad doesn't get pushed around. You're not eating that. Knows when to say no. -No, give it back. You do, don't you? He makes things go his way. Was it wrong of me to scare people? It was. You owe Rikkie 50 euro. But it helps that people are still a bit frightened of my father. Listen Barry... I told you a minute ago I don't need stainless steel knifes. So unless you want me to go over there and hit the crap out of your ears... ...you better get off the phone. If you or any of your colleagues ever call here again... ...you will regret it. Do I make myself clear, Barry? Yes 'sir'. Goodbye Barry. I believe you should get dressed. -I believe you're right. Do you know what time it is? Of course I do. It's 12:50, mam. Where's the pesto? -Anton! I wanted to congratulate you. Congratulations. -Thanks. Nice ceremony. -Yes. Yes, super. Dad, shall we...? Yes, okay, were gonna... -Ciao. I'd like to propose a toast to Paul. A very welcome addition to our family. A bookkeeper. We couldn't have wished for more. To Paul and Gina Boskampi. And this is how my father became some sort of mafia boss... ...and me a mafia kid. I think it's nice that we can be here despite everything. Yes it's nice. -Thanks. I have to check on the ciabatta. Gerda, put this in your purse. -What? Put this in your purse. -Why? Fingerprints. Quick. Fingerprints? Why can't you just enjoy yourself for once? Look at Mr. Boskampi. He might be a criminal... ...but I'm sure he takes his wife on a vacation... ...and takes her for a walk. Gerda... -No! Gerda stay here.
