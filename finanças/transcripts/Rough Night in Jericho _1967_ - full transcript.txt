Dolan? Dolan! Sorry about that bump. Bump? What bump? Well, now that you're awake, you gonna come up here and spell me or not? I'm a passenger, not a driver. Listen, Dolan... Jump! Now, took you long enough to get him. Didn't. Moved like an Apache. Yeah, you must be gettin' old. Must be. Let's see the damage. I've had worse. Shut up and lean back. Tie this thing, will ya? How do you figure it, Ben? Why the bushwhack? That's right, ask a lot of fool questions while I bleed to death. Well, he didn't try to kill us. Mean anything to you? Yeah. Means you figured on burying me here. Now, get that coach up on its four legs, and get me... I hope you fainted, but I doubt it. Who is it? It's Claire, Mr. Flood. Hi. I told you to be here when I got back, didn't I? Don't be mad. Wait'll you see what I brought. It's the latest thing from the east. I'm sorry, Mr. Flood. I only wanted to surprise you... When I tell you to do something, you damn well do it. I know, but I thought I'd be back... I'll tell you when to think and what. I just wanted to look especially nice for you. That's all it was, Mr. Flood. I swear. All right, Claire, honey. How you gonna look especially nice if you cry, huh? I wouldn't ever do anything against you, Mr. Flood. That's the honest truth. What did you buy, honey? Can I show you? If it's something to put on, put it on. Mr. Flood? Yarbrough. Glad you're back. We run into a little trouble. Go on. Get on with it. Well, this morning, uh, one of the new men, Toby Wheelock... He started roughin' up that storekeeper, McGivern. That's your job. I know, but sometimes them young fellers is always tryin' to make a name for themselves. How bad is McGivern? It ain't McGivern. It's Wheelock. That storekeeper went and killed him with a pitch fork. Well, McGivern knew Wheelock was one of my men. Now that puppy dog deputy's tryin' to take hisself serious. Says he's gonna hold McGivern for trial. That's good enough. He's entitled to a fair trial. Whatever you say, Mr. Flood. Well, that's the law. Well, Gus, how long will it take you to round up a jury? Oh, uh, 10, 15 minutes. Make that a half hour. Right, Mr. Flood. Jace, you see anything? I swear, I just don't know what got into me. Stupid. That's what I am, just plain stupid. No argument from me. I was just minding my own business when he comes in, and he starts shoving me around. Like a fool, I... I lose my temper and... Here they come. I should've quit this town right after the sheriff got bushwhacked. But you didn't, Jace. Remember that. You didn't. Just wishin', Charlie, that's all. Open up, Jace. I want McGivern. He's my prisoner, Mr. Flood. Nobody gets him. You're protecting a murderer, Jace. That's my job. He gets a fair trial. Good enough, but the town's gonna try him right now. Uh, no, sir. The first of the month, when the circuit judge comes by. That's fair enough. I mean... Well, a week or so won't make too much difference. Will it, Mr. Flood? Hear that, Jace? McGivern's got friends out here. Sure, but I gotta wait for the judge. You got exactly one minute to open that door, Deputy, or Nat here is gonna drop this package right down that chimney and open it for ya. Fifty seconds. Forty seconds. Thirty seconds. Jace! Give me a gun and let me out. Twenty seconds. Can't, Charlie. I'll do my best, I promise you that. Ten seconds. You pointing that Winchester at me, sonny? I'm ordering you and your men to leave, Mr. Flood. You drop that gun and get out of my way right now. Even if your men kill me, I'll still take you with me when I go down. Then we'll both be dead. Your choice, sonny. You make it. Looks like this tin is a little too heavy for you, sonny. All right. That's enough. Folks, a town without a duly elected sheriff becomes a lawless town. I propose we elect a sheriff right now. I nominate Gus Torrey. Hey, Simms, you wanna second it? Yeah, I second it. Good, any other nominations? Ryan? You wanna nominate anybody? Well, you're a man that usually has something to say. Got any suggestions? You? Well, it looks like it's unanimous there, Jess. Congratulations. Do a good job for us, huh? Well, I aim to, Mr. Flood, starting now. Yarbrough, Simms... I'm deputizing you. Murderer in there wants a trial. All right, let's pick a jury. Johnson, Ramirez... Uh, no. No! The law says you gotta give me a trial! Jace! Jace, for God's sake, stop them! Stop them. Jace! All right. This man killed Toby Wheelock. In self-defense. A man's got a right to defend himself and his property. Sheriff. Jury? Guilty! Guilty! No, Jace! I told you! I told you I was just trying to defend myself! No... No, Jace! Stop them! Stop them! Somebody help me! Give me a fair trial! Help! Turn him loose! Now, Molly, honey, a hanging's no place for you. There won't be a hanging. Jury says there will. It's all legal. Tell your men to turn McGivern loose. You're interrupting justice, Molly. Not one more step. Now, turn him loose. Feels just like old times, doesn't it, honey? Let me go! Let go! Get on with it. Right, Mr. Flood. Boys... Hey, friend. Yeah? Where's the Lang and Hickman stage office? Do you know where the Lang stage office is? It's down the far end of that street, going south. Much obliged. I'm sure glad to see you, Mr. Hickman. My name's Dolan. Hickman's been shot. Get a doctor. Well, how bad is he? Get a doctor. Oh, yeah. At the top of the stairs, the room to your right. He'll need some tendin', Molly. I'll take care of him. Lots of strong beef broth with barley. Yeah. That'll be $1, Mr. Dolan. She'll pay it. I have some money downstairs. Tell me, Doc, do you have many hangings in this town? Can't say. That fella strung up in the plaza... What did he do? I wouldn't know. He oughta be up and around inside a week or so. Hope so. You always leave them dangling overnight? Never noticed. Any particular reason you never noticed? Yes, Mr. Dolan. My wife and children. Oh, Ben. You've been had. Thank you for coming over, Dan. Not at all, Molly. Now, don't you worry. He'll be all right. I helped myself to a cup of coffee. Hope you don't mind. How long since you ate? This morning, King City. I've got some cold ham. Thank you. That would be fine. Good. I'm sorry about Mr. Hickman. Well, those things happen. I know who did it. Looks good. Don't you want to know? Not particularly. Ma'am, do you know what you do when you walk into a bad bar, and the hairs at the back of your neck stick up? You get your drink, you pay for it, you turn around, and you walk out. And this is a bad bar? Yes, ma'am. Jericho is a bad bar. As soon as Ben's up to it, why, him and me will be leaving. But he shot Mr. Hickman. He'd been shot before. All right, if it'll make you feel better, who? Flood, Alex Flood. Is he in Jericho? Do you know him? Yeah, I heard of him. Why did you have to write Ben that letter? I knew his reputation as a marshal before he decided to retire. Ben's past 60. He didn't decide to retire. They retired him. I didn't know that. True. But I never lied to him. I told him the line was in trouble, the help scared off. He didn't tell you. Not a word. Sure knew your man, though. Tell Ben there's trouble, and he'd think he's 20 years younger. He couldn't wait to get here. Did he mention he had an ex-deputy with him? Yeah. And you figured I'd come along, you'd get two professionals for the price of one. Yes, I thought of that. Thank you, ma'am. Mr. Dolan, when we pick up the passengers at the Globe Relay Station on Monday, we'll be back in business. How? Piggyback? We'll patch up the coach and start rolling on Monday. We can do it, Mr. Dolan. I've got $400 invested in that coach, and that's as far as I go. No sense throwing good money after bad. I'm a gambler. I play the percentages, and I don't like the odds. Then there's nothing more I can say? No, ma'am. Well... What happened to your husband? Husbands. I've been widowed twice. They die in bed? My first husband got hit by a stray bullet in a drunken gunfight, and Frank got his head kicked in by a mean colt... out here in the corral. Your husbands don't seem to have much luck. They thought different. They say so? I know so. Been a widow very long? Not long enough for it to bother me, so don't let it bother you. I wasn't going to. Any more questions? Yes. Where do I sleep? The spare room's to the left. The bed's made. Thank you. Good night. Mr. Dolan. Good night, Ms. Lang. How you feeling? Lousy barley. Man can't live on this slop unless'n he has something to wash it down with. I'll see what I can do. Well, howdy. False rumor, Jess. We heard Molly's new partner was shot. You heard right. Ben Hickman. He's upstairs. The old marshal? One of the greats in his time, Jess. Still better than most. Good friend of yours? Sort of partners. My name's Dolan. Oh, I'm Flood. This is Sheriff Torrey. Molly's in town, looking for a wheel for that busted coach. Back watchers? No, deputies. Jess always keeps them handy. How many you got, Jess? Fourteen, Mr. Flood. We need them to keep the peace. No guns allowed in town. You looking for something? Whiskey. Oh, not there. Try the cupboard. No, on the right, second shelf. Thanks. Want me to question the old man now, Mr. Flood? I don't know. Uh, Dolan? How's the marshal feeling? Good enough. Well, ask him if he's up to answering some questions, huh? Sure. Ben? Sheriff's downstairs. Wanna see him? Why, sure. Why not? What the hell you call that? That's no drink. Give me my regular three fingers. You want it or not? You're rattlesnake mean, Dolan. Sheriff's with a friend of Ms. Lang's, name "Flood". You owe me two and half fingers. She ever mention that name to you? I never talked to Ms. Lang before this morning, when she was bandaging me. You didn't answer my question. And you didn't give me my drink. Must be her coming home. Did you give her the money to buy a new wheel? You mean she got us a new wheel? Get out of my house, Flood. That's no way to talk, Molly. I said get out of my house! And take your hangman with you. I think this batch of cookies has too much vanilla in it, honey. Mr. Dolan, kick him out. Never step in between close friends or argue with the law. You can't blame her for being excited, Dolan. Longest run of tough luck I ever did see. And, Molly, honey, you just say the word and I'll have a new coach out there for you in time to make that run. That's a nice offer, Ms. Lang. For 51% of the line? You can go to hell, Flood. I'll be rolling on schedule without you. I hope so, Molly. I really do, but the way your luck's been runnin'... My only bad luck is you're not dead yet. Ms. Lang, you have a sick man upstairs. Least you can do is take care of him. Do I go along, Mr. Flood? He's fit. "Do I go along, Mr. Flood? "Do I go on breathing, Mr. Flood? "Do I go on living, Mr. Flood?" Feisty, but lovable. Sit down, Dolan. Thanks, but... I like the view better over here. Of course. Have one. All right. You swing a lot of weight around here. Only 51% of everything I touch, except the Lang stage line. Lang and Hickman. Oh, the pain will wear off. Hickman's deputy in Santa Fe, weren't you? Used to be. Forty a month, every month you were alive to collect it. That why you quit Abilene four years back? Oh, I got $50 a month. Now I got a town, Dolan, a town, cattle, part of a mine territory. They brought me in to tame it, and I stayed to take my profits. Is this tamed? I don't think you'll hear any complaints. Well, one exception. Don't you think she can be tamed? Haven't thought about it one way or another. No? After sleeping under the same roof? It's a big roof. Small town, Dolan. I'll tell you what I'll do. The hotel is usually all full up. Your hotel. Only 51%. I'll tell 'em you're coming over, and they'll fix up something real special for you. Real thoughtful. Ex-lawman to ex-lawman, it's my pleasure. Mr. Flood? Seems the old man didn't see the bushwhacker, but he said maybe he did. Ex-lawman to ex-lawman, I wouldn't recognize him if I was sitting right here in the same room with him. But you know something, Flood? You're right. Little too much vanilla in those cookies. Dolan, when you get in town, you look me up, huh? Ace-Deuce Palace. Try your luck? Maybe later. I'll take three. Just looked over your 51%. Very nice. Hotel says you didn't show. Couldn't. Ben worries about his health. Oh, when Hickman worries, you worry? Used to be the other way around. Like to sit in? Buy you a drink instead. No, my place. I'll do the buying. I was hoping you'd say that. What's that "uh-uh" mean? I don't like the odds put on any of those deal sliders. Sure? It's my business to be sure. Harv? Yes, Mr. Flood. Table five, Joe Ross... He's all thumbs. Fire him. Fire him? Yeah, fire him. Yes, sir. Found out yet who ambushed you? Injuns? Hold-up crew? I figure Indians or somebody with just about as much know-how. Ever do any injun fightin'? Little. You know, I was thinking. You walk like an Indian. Lived with 'em a long time back. May I? Certainly, Claire. Sit and have a drink. Thank you, Mr. Flood. This is Dolan. Pleased to meet you, I'm sure, Mr. Dolan. Likewise, Miss Claire. You like my friend, honey? Do you want me to like him, Mr. Flood? No. Dolan knows I share nothing with nobody. Except whiskey and cookies. Joan? Would you like to meet a girl, Mr. Dolan? Thank you, ma'am. I'll let you know if I do. Here's to fun and... You hear what he's tellin' us to do, cousin Purley? Hand it over. And just who in the hell's gonna make me? Just obeying orders, mister. You gotta check it. This gun goes where I go. Hey, big man. Law says no guns. You the law? No, I am. Yeah? Yeah. Well, I don't see no badge. I don't need no badge, big mouth. It's up there on the ledge. He levelin', Purley? He's levelin'. Okay, friend. You win. All of it, mister. Under the coat. Sure, why in the hell not? You. Clean. The knife inside your boot. Flood! Harv? Arrest him. Boys, get him out of here. Let's get back to the tables, boys. The louse cut you. Go on over and get me another jacket, will you, honey? Are you all right, Mr. Flood? I'm fine... The gray jacket. Thanks for the yell, Dolan. Old habit. A man's back's a tender spot. You did all right. Is that why you didn't step in? Stepping in's a habit I outgrew. That's smart. Helps a man stay alive a long time. Phil? Lock him up. We'll hang him after the trial. Jericho's a law-abiding town, Dolan. Here's to law and order. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, sir. What would you like for breakfast? Same thing as Ben had. His plate's so clean I can't tell what it was. Just ham and eggs. Ben, he goes for home-cookin'. You don't? No, ma'am. Oh, that's Frank Ryan and his boy. They have the general store here. They're good friends of mine. They'd like to meet you. I won't be around long enough to make friends. We can beat him, Mr. Dolan. - Believe me, we can. - You can't. I saw the town last night. Monday, Ben and me will be gone. Oh, Ben say so? He will when he hears the count. And I can go to the devil. Or to Flood. All you have to do is say the word. I have. The word is "never." It wasn't always. No, not when he first came here to do a job that needed doing. He stopped all the killings and stealing. Everybody in this town looked up to him. We were mistaken. Me, most of all. 49% of something is better than 100% of nothing. No. Your choice. If I could get help, six men or more, good men, then will you and Ben stay on? Merchants? We're going to have a meeting at Ryan's place. Sheep against wolves. Talk sense, Ms. Lang. You have two choices, give Flood what he wants or pack up and move along. Everything inside your head are odds, percentages. You know Flood shot Ben, but that doesn't matter. You don't like the odds so you cut and run. You aren't very much of a man, are you, Mr. Dolan? Ms. Lang, you're burning breakfast. Oh, damn! Just as well. Man who gets too attached to home-cookin' can't think straight. I'll eat breakfast in town. Mr. Dolan, hold off telling Ben till after the meeting? Give me a chance to change the odds. I'm sorry, Ms. Lang. Why won't Pa let me stay up tonight? Your pa has his reasons. Now, don't you ask again, ya hear? Come back to try your luck? Yes, ma'am. Pot's open for five. Without me. Call. Your five and 10. Fold. Pass. Call. Cards. One. Dealer takes one. Better odds tonight? Much. Bet 10. Call. Kings and treys. Beats jacks and nines. Looks like you know your business, Dolan. It's a living. Carl? Yes, Mr. Flood. How much you got in your bank, Dolan? $462. Bring me $462 out of petty cash. Yes, sir. Open for five. Call. Out. My five. Fold. Buy you a drink? No, thanks. Never drink when I'm working. Your deal, Mr. Flood. Didn't expect to see you here tonight, Dolan. Why not? Figured you'd be tied up in a meeting. Bet five. What meeting? Call. Raise 10. Secret meeting, Ryan's house, 10:00. Call the raise. Don't know any Ryans. How much longer do you intend to wait, Molly? Miller's usually ahead of time. It's nothing. I'm sure Miller will be here soon. Maybe he ain't comin'. Likely he ain't. His wife's dead set against it. I don't want this to take anymore time than it has to, so let's get started. You talk, Dolan. Right, but softly. Twenty. I'm feeling charitable in a small way. Raise you 20. - What was that? - I don't know. Let's take a look. Come on. Down the street, Ryan's store... Alterations. It's been raised. You callin' or foldin'? Callin'. And 40 more. Confident. Forty... And 60. Go. Two. Same. That's a nice-lookin' watch. Runs a few minutes fast. How much you got there, Dolan? $646. That's the bet. Hey, you hear that? - What was it? - One hell of an explosion! Come on! Sounds to me like the meeting's adjourned. The bet's 646 to you, Dolan. She's all right. Things that belong to me never get damaged. You callin' my hand? I'd never face myself if I didn't. You're called. Three of a kind. Same. Tens. Queens. Can't win them all. Your turn to buy. Glad you won, Dolan. That'll give you and the old marshal traveling money. And the sooner, the better. Or the first thing I know, you and me are liable to wind up being friends. Ms. Lang? Are you all right? Go ahead and cry. You got a right. Last thing I need is your advice. Easy, that'll knock you on your ear. It's my ear. Yarbrough and Simms really had a great time. They dragged us out of the house. Aggie Ryan fought like a tiger. They planted dynamite and blew her home to bits. Years of scrimping and saving... Everything they owned! Do you know that... Eh, you wouldn't. Maybe I would. The hell you would. They made us stand there while they took Ryan. And in front of his wife and son, beat him and beat him and... Beat him. First one, then the other! Laughing all the time they did it. I'm sorry it happened. Hurray for being sorry. Mr. Dolan, you stink. Go ahead, get it off your chest. You're damn right. I've got some things I wanna say to you, Mr. Dolan. Just a few. I'm not in any hurry. You can't wait to high-tail it out of Flood's sight. Right. You got a yellow streak down your back this wide. This wide? Right. That's what I said. I just don't understand you, Mr. Dolan. Ben, I understand. Fred and Aggie Ryan, people all over the world. Even a louse like Alex Flood I understand. You really are a stinker, Mr. Dolan. I know what you're thinking. "I told you so." That's what you're thinking. Sheep. Wolves against sheep. Go on, all right. Why don't you tell me how right you were? I just don't understand you, Mr. Dolan. Ben, Aggie, Frank Ryan, I understand. People all over the world, I understand. Even Alex Flood... Mr. Dolan, you are a bastard. I'm going to bed. I'm gonna kiss you. You didn't have to do that. Just can't figure you, Dolan. Just can't figure you. Mr. Dolan? Somebody ought to put dynamite down your chimney. Good morning. I'm sorry I'm late getting started. You and Ben must be starved. Ham steaks and fried potatoes all right? Give me a chunk of that bacon grease, will you? I could do with some more firewood if you're up to chopping it. Anytime. Mr. Dolan, if you can't handle whisky, you shouldn't drink. Who put who to bed last night? I'll have your breakfast going soon. No hurry. Rough night? Yeah. Dolan told me about your pulling out as soon as you're strong enough. I want to thank you for your offer of leaving the coach. Well, don't thank me. That was Dolan's idea. Kind of a hard fella to figure out, ain't he? Yes, he is. Whaddya think you'd do if you were him? That's even harder to figure. Mrs. Lang? You know something? I wish I was 10 years younger. So do I, Mr. Hickman. Thanks. I'll have breakfast ready in no time. No, thanks. Think I'll go into town and get some whisky. Ben will be wanting his three fingers, and we're fresh out. Comes from having a drunk in the house. Two. Visitors. Hired killers. Badge gives them a license. Mrs. Lang. About this coach, got some things I wanna tell ya. You mean ordered to tell me. Yeah, that's right. I've been lookin' forward to it. This paper here says you ain't paid your bills or the bank. They'll be paid. Hey, get away from that coach. Some coach. Sure is tore up inside. Don't touch it! Sure is flimsy, ain't it? Leave it alone! You wanna bet I can't tear this off with one hand? Ha! You wanna bet you don't? You interferin' with the law, Dolan? I wouldn't think of it. Just protecting private property. That coach is mine. That's not what this paper says. Read it yourself. Drop your gun belts. Anytime. I never hurry a man wants to die. You won't get out of town alive, Dolan. My problem. Yours is getting out of here. Now, drop it. You too, Yarbrough. Come on. Now... Throw them in the horse trough. You must be crazy, Dolan. You know who we work for. It's your turn, Dolan. Throw that Winchester in the horse trough. Just a little more tightening's all she'll need. Hook 'im, Mr. Flood! Ride him, Mr. Flood! Right in there! Attaboy! Way to ride. Nice ridin', Mr. Flood. Terrific! Sure likes to jump. Nasty enough to be mine. Don't look like she's gonna stay busted, Mr. Flood. Well, then, we'll just go around and around again. I hope he likes it same as me. You said last night nothing belongs to you ever gets damaged. That's right. You forgot to tell your men. What did you use on 'em? Single tree. Oh. Where's Simms? I don't know. Probably at the doctor's. That man was a deputy. Way I look at it, a man starts choking a woman is looking to go to hell in a hurry. All I did was oblige him. Same as you do, Mr. Flood. Well, the problem is you're you and I'm me. Different privileges. Majority rules. Why don't you take your traveling money and clear out? Can't wait to do it soon as Ben's fit. He's fit enough. Why don't you just leave town the way you came in, in this coach? Tomorrow, 'bout 9:00 or 10:00. Whatever's best. 9:00. It's earlier. You want me to take him with me? You killed him, you bury him. Oh, and Dolan... One minute after 9:00, and I'll hang you. No question about it, Dolan. You gotta pull out like he said, or he'll hang you for sure. Sick man like me... Even Flood would give me a day or two. No, Dolan. Too much light. Hurts my eyes. I figured you'd be fit enough to ride out with me now. I wish to God I could, but I'll meet up with you wherever you say. Waco. All right. I could sure use three fingers to kill this pain. Hurts that bad, huh? Yeah, it comes and goes. No, don't touch... You can't... I ain't leavin', and I ain't meetin' up with ya. You gave me your word. I know I did. But I gotta break it. You never took... And nothing you can say's gonna change my mind. Come Monday, hell or high water, that coach is gonna do what it's supposed to do. It's gonna pull out on schedule. Oh, stop talking like a damn fool. If you want to commit suicide, get back into bed and blow your head off. At least you'll die comfortable. I came here because you asked me to. Now I'm asking you to leave. You owe me that much, Ben. More... Much more, but I owe myself, too. Any man there is, Dolan, has to have some reason to get up in the morning. Oh, that's very touching. We'll put that on your tombstone. "Here lies Ben Hickman, "who had to have a reason to get up in the morning." What the hell's the matter with you? Can't you admit you're too old? This isn't Tucson 15 years ago. This is Jericho. You're 63, and there's a town full of guns out there. Those are the facts. You're thinking with this instead of this. And in our business, that's when they bury you! And you know it! Now, get your gear together, and let's get out of here. So long, Dolan. Nothing but the best to you. We're obliged to you, Mr. Dolan. Never thought I'd see you again. What are the odds? You got a glass? Got three of them. I told Molly we'd be needing them when you got back. Molly! Molly? See? I told you, never argue with the best friend of a best friend. You know he'll hang you, Dolan. Probably. Over my dead body. Most likely. Your friend Ryan... Will he fight? Oh, he'd die trying. That brings the odds way down. Only 10 to one. Jace! He was acting sheriff until he tried to stop a lynching. Anybody else? Nobody that I can think of. Four guns makes it nine to one. Eight to one. You forgot me. Yes, sir. Just 10 years younger. Well, I see you're eight minutes ahead of a rope, huh? Too bad we never got a chance to get together, Marshal. From what I've been hearing, it's my pleasure. Got yourself a pretty salty partner, Dolan. Still time to buy you a last drink. Only minutes ahead of a rope makes swallowing too tough. But maybe we'll run into each other again someday. You ever run into me again, you still won't like the odds. Certain plans I've made don't include having you around. Do we understand each other? Majority rules. Why did you have to say I was 63 in front of Mrs. Lang? Sixty-four come August. Cheer up. We'll be at Flood's herd pretty soon, and you're still not too old to rustle. Molly, why don't you simmer down? And why don't you just get out? Now, wait a minute, I came her real nice with my hat in my hand and thought maybe... I'm not interested. Molly, I have to treat everybody the same in this town. Now, you don't really think I give a damn about cuttin' in on this place. The only thing I wanna do is take over you, dear, for better or worse. That's all over, Flood. It used to be "Alex," honey. And you used to be different. Different? A hired gunslinger? No, a law man, proud of his job. How can you be proud on 50 a month? - Is that the kind of a man you want? - I did. But not now. That's right. Well, let's find out. Well, you didn't help much. You turn my stomach. Dolan? Is that what you think? I'm asking you. That's why you ran him out of town. I didn't like him living under the same roof with you. Not just under the same roof, Flood. And I loved every minute of it. That's for lying. Am I lying? Did he or didn't he? You'll never know. You lousy tramp. Yes or no? If you want that stage to roll, come see me. Only don't walk. Crawl. You like for me to shave you, don't you, Mr. Flood? Among other things, I like for you to shave me, yes. Can I ask you something else, Mr. Flood? Barber's privilege. Did she ever shave you? I changed my mind. I don't like for you to shave me. I know I said the wrong thing. - I'm sorry, Mr. Flood. - Who is it? Gus Torrey, Mr. Flood. Come in. - Please, Mr. Flood, don't be mad... - Shut up. What's the trouble? I just heard that 50 head are missing from your south range, Mr. Flood. When? Oh, it was an hour or so ago. I just sent six men out to track them. You know, it sure don't figure. Who'd be crazy enough to run off any of your cattle? Sure makes a man wonder, don't it? I count six. That's a start. You make a fine cup of coffee, Mrs. Lang. Oh, thanks. Oh, that reminds me. I've got some hardtack, too. - Like some? - Yeah. - Molly. - Dolan. Torrey sent out six men to track the cattle. We saw them. Who did that? Flood. It's not important. It is to me. Howdy, Ben. Ryan, how are ya? Howdy. You must be Marshal Hickman. I heard about you from my... Yeah, well, don't say it. Even if you heard about me from your daddy, don't say it. No, sir. I won't. Glad to have you with us, Deputy. Ex-deputy. Talk like that upsets me, son. Man puts himself down sounds to me like an amateur. Probably fights like one. Difference between an amateur and a professional... Professional figures out a way to cut down the odds before he makes his move. Now, me and Dolan... We're professionals. That's why you and Ryan here are lucky. You're about to become the beneficiaries of our experience. Right, Dolan? Right. One of Marshal Hickman's shorter lectures. I'll fight, Mr. Hickman. How much dynamite you got, Ryan? Plenty. Jace, you and Ben hit the main ranch house. Ryan, you... Flood owes me a house. All right, Ryan. That leaves you the big granary. I'll take care of the mine. All right, let's move. Hey, Dolan. What about me? You go home. Damned if I will. But first, douse the fire. I can smell that coffee for a mile. Can I get ya somethin' to eat, Mr. Flood? Can I get you something to eat? No, no, no, I'm all right. There oughta be some word on my cattle by now. Well, look, I'll go check. Any word? No, not yet, Mr. Flood. But I told them they better not come back without your cattle, so I'm sure... What was that? - Sounded like dynamite! - Not far from town. That's not far off. Exactly one mile. Your granary. That first one was my ranch house. What the hell's going on here? They're working me over in a circle. Start north with the cattle. Ranch is east. Granary's south. The next is west. The mine. I want a dozen men in five minutes. Come on. Come on. Listen. Someone's back. I told you there's nothing to worry about. He'll probably want a drink. It's Jace. You all right, Jace? Scared, but I'm used to that. No Dolan? Nope. Well, this is gettin' to look like a wake. I think I'll stretch out upstairs. Doesn't look too good, does it? He's not worried, why should we be? - I got his horse. - He's down there. There he is. Dolan! It's hangin' time. He's trapped. We'll go down after him. Suppose Dolan doesn't make it. He will. - Relax. - Yeah, like you. How come you didn't sleep? I wasn't tired. It's Dolan. We haven't got much time. It'll be daylight soon. Drink up. Thanks. Took you long enough for a simple job. Worried about me? Me? Not a fraction. Mr. Hickman. Do you always put black queens on black kings? Sure. I cheat. And win. Congratulations. All right, Jace, give me the rundown. Eleven men left in town, counting Simms. Three patrolling, two on duty at the jail. This where I check my gun, gentlemen? Joe'll take it, Pop. Are you jokin'? Do I look like it? All right, peel 'em off, boys. Hurry up. There I am, sitting quietly at the bar... It's very late. Please go away. - I look over my shoulder... - Lady, I just want a little drink. Some other time, mister. I don't want some other time. Mister, we got laws in this town. All right, what's going on here? Now turn around easy. Very good. Anytime. Well, no sign of him. He couldn't have gotten far. Yeah. Where's Phillips? He's right back... Phillips? We're short one man, one horse. Let's get back to town. Wait here. If we don't come out, you're on your own. He said to wait here. Try it again. The setup's like you said. Good. Remember, don't move until you get to 40. Look who's teachin' me how to suck egg. Difference between a professional and an amateur. 1, 2... 3, 5, 5... Checkin' it... 7... 8, 9, 10, 11... 12, 13, 14... 15, 16, 17, 18... 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27... Charley? 32, 33... 34, 35, 36, 37... 38... 39, 40. Hey, Grandpa! Turn in that gun. Hey! No! This belongs to you. Thanks. Go ahead, Sheriff. Give 'em hell. Just stay where you are, all of you! I got things to say, and you best listen. You just got up off the floor, and you're stayin' up. We've been livin' on our knees long enough. Damn you! Look at me! We've been given a chance to take back our town. Now, who's gonna stand up and take that chance? You figure to start us off, Miller? Count me in. Me, too. I'll go along. So will I. Ryan. You go to the Ace-Deuce and wait till this is over. All right. Ryan, can you get a team and hitch this buckboard? Sure, right away. We're all set. These men are willing to fight. Better than I expected. Sir, I kind of changed my mind. I got to think of my family. You wanna go home? Sure do. Get. All right, you two boys come with me. You, you, get in the wagon. Jace, get this rig ready to block the north street. Right. Get up on that roof. Take the middle window in the hardware store. You all set? I'll tell you when. Evening, Mr. Flood. Quiet enough. Yeah, let's split up. Meet you in front of the hotel. All right, Mr. Flood. Mr. Flood! Go back. It's a trap! Go back! Yaah! Ben! Get back! I... I... I fought for you. - Hold 'em high! - Don't shoot, don't shoot. - Off your horse! - All right, step down, - Hold 'em high! - ...and do it quick. Come on! Now, give me that real easy. Dolan, it's all over! We've been... Flood. Dolan. Don't take less than... Fifty-one percent.
