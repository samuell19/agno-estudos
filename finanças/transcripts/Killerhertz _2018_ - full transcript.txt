Hey, what's up? Okay, okay... slow down Whats up? What?! Yeah, this is it It's the cheapest we'll find Wait, wait, wait, wait.... Yes, hello? HELLO? Hello? Hello? - Whatever - Oh come on - Hey Hi - Hey, I'm Kyle Hey, I'm Casey - You're here to see the room? - Yeah Come through Please close the door behind you yeah? - Was it easy to find? - Yeah - So are you both studying? - Uh-uh, I just got a J.O.B. So here's the room Pretty decent size The agency gave you the particulars? - Yeah, yeah nice - Yeah And the bathroom Casey! Oh shit - Hey - Hey What's this? Six-thousand hertz sub-sine - Military use them for torture - Hot I gotta' acclimatize My olfactory system is bugging out You should do some actual studying bro - You giving the Sloane Ranger an eyeful? - FUCK OFF! I spent the last two years in a bikini it's not for him Seriously paranoid Yeah, before.... Look, I just want to make you happy Remember when you used to come to bed? I'd be happy if you, like, did that sometime I know, i know I just have to get this module done It's frying me I have to make this presentation My Dad's going to whip me if I don't come up with something - Do ya got anything? - Zip! I dunno.... I got all this.... Concept The Ideas. But.... No framework to hang it on It's like having the most awesome engine.... And no race car to put it in Stop trying to fix me Kyle I am going to make you smile again Even if it kills me You build a time machine with that shit? I dunno, maybe? With enough processing power anything's possible Oh perfect. Shit! LIVE FROM UTOPIA! Seriously thought, put some pants on Ed's British - Hey Dad - Ky, you look terrible Are you sick? Uhhh, no. No no... I'm fine. Just Vampire screen face I guess I'm a little behind with this paper Behind? Why? You know, I told you I thought Studying in the UK was too much for you There's a perfectly decent place in the next state I know, I know but.... This University has the best equiped server room of any Besides.... We needed to get away Casey needed the change Of course I.... I understand that. But it shouldn't be at the expense of your future Ky Do you think Bill Gates or Steve Jobs... Hey, stop the microwave HEY! ...you need your own spark.... HEY, STOP THE MICROWAVE! - Shut it off - What? It's killing the wireless signal Look! Something that will.... Give you a distinct advantage above those other contenders Did you re-decorate? Is that Casey? - No, that's Ed - Hey Ed! Is that Edward or Edmund? Edmund Igor Dalton Russian mother hence obtuse middle name Must Dash. Got a second interview for a partnership Now he looks like he's going places Electric personality! Come on Casey.... Be happy It's easy All you gotta do is smile Hey, put phone away! Huh? You're not here to make phone playing! It's not.... I.... - Whatever - You concentrate on work.... As much as you like the distraction of phone playing This BIG BIG problem! Seven! Here you go Mom - I mean.... - It's okay Hey! Ayyyyyyy It's Trauma Induced Hydrophobia It's a P.T.S.D. I.... - Don't like water on me - Aaaaaaaa You should be washing hands properly I am! Look "kills bacteria" It's not proper It's no good ....a resolution to the current situation engineers are facing - Thank you - Thank you, Sandra Right, Um, next up we have.... Kyle Zeiger Ready Kyle? So.... Um.... what I've been developing.... Is a system for utilising radio frequencies.... To send high voltage power via wi-fi I'm not talking about small currents I mean very high voltages Transmitted from towers similar to phone masts Enough to power.... Vehicles.... Trains.... The possibilities are infinite! We know we can send data through the various frequencies But, if we are ever going to be able to transmit power wirelessly.... We evidently require a system.... For encoding physical energy into data and back again I believe I have an algorithm that could achieve this Using dedicated frequencies.... For variable voltage loads There has been a.... Good amount of research done.... Into radio frequency energy harvesting Kyle If I could just run a full simulation on the 380Z I'm not talking about extracting energy from the air I believe I can create very high voltage currents Instant power! And with a fast enough processor.... There would be zero latency Whatever Doc Brown! Grow up Kenny Kyle! Listen.... You can't be disillusioned by the many But you saw them They looked at me like I'm nuts I'm just saying.... That what you're suggesting.... Is perhaps a little 'off base' for this module But.... There's no reason you shouldn't pursue it as a side project Why? What's the point? You saw the reaction in there Nobody.... Whoever did anything brave or new.... Listened to naysayers or conjecture New and off-beat thinking is always going to be challenged It's human nature People fear the change Tell it to my Dad Remember, its up to you to prove them wrong Oh come one, come on come on Shit! Ah, it's not in here Oh god, oh god, oh god oh god, come on! Oh fuck! It's not in here Oh god God! Fuck! Come on Oh please, please, please, please, please, please, please.... Casey, have you looked upstairs? Of course! Man I'm so bummed! I don't give a shit about the phone. It's just.... I have shitloads of photos on there I don't have anywhere else You don't have them backed up? Kyle's the.... backer upper I try and live in the moment Besides, I dropped it in the ocean and.... the chip thing is broken Kyle says it's the salt water Do you miss the beach? Yeah. Kinda Wait a second! This is stupid Why don't we just call it? Oh yeah! It's ringing Shit! Please leave a voice message.... - Voicemail - Oh fuck Relax, don't worry Casey? CASEY? Casey? Hey, are you okay? I was calling you I lost my phone Casey! Hey! Hey, what's going on? He was touching you This is juvenile Bullshit Kyle He was helping me look! Helping by touching? Right Dude, you are so out of line! I'm allowed to not like men touching my Girlfriend Barely What? He was barely touching me. FUCK THIS! Motherfucker! That's extraordinary So.... It was there this whole time? Unless.... Ed is punking you? Uh-uh dude, we checked the whole joint She's right I actually upturned the table to look beneath it twice One of you must have unconciously replaced it But we never heard it ring! Ed called it. It was right here in this room I assure you Kyle, we did You know, subconcious activity is accountable for.... Most of our daily routine There are libraries full of cognitive response shit! Dude, do not tell us what we did or didn't see I think a drink is in order I think it's a sign. I think it's my mom You seriously believe your dead Mother hid your phone? My Mom used to say this thing when her Mom died.... She couldn't deal with it It hit her pretty hard and she started drinking quite heavily and stuff But she used to say how.... She couldn't believe that her Mom never gave her a sign that she was around I think my Mom just gave me a sign! You're always saying how you want me to be happy. Well.... Seeing that.... That made me happy again No, no. Listen sweetie.... I'd love nothing more than for that to be true All of it. Who wouldn't right? - But.... - Dude, if you don't believe me prove me wrong My Grandmother used to have this expression.... When something weird used to happen "There's more to heaven and earth than we can understand" Excuse me chaps. I may well be up for a.... Significant promotion tomorrow Beauty sleep and all that jazz In this episode I'm going to be investigating.... Electronic Voice Phenomena or E.V.P. I spoke with clairvoyant.... And noted author on paranormal studies.... Jackie Slater What is your feeling.... As a human conduit.... About the viability of electronic means.... Of connecting with these energies? Yes, spirit energy does seem translatable Obviously an ideal carrier would be another person The issue with EVP is that..... It does seem prone to vague interpretations Almost like a predictive autocorrect Have you, yourself, experienced this in your line of work? Yes I've had spirits communicate via electronic devices Rather than directly through myself Such as? Um, lightbulbs..... televisions.... radios How do you believe this kind of interfacing is possible? Obviously working on some..... sort of.... Electronic frequency I think it's a sign.... I think it's my Mom ....Electronic frequency What the? Fuck Kyle! Kyle! Kyle Kyle what the fuck is going on? Sorry I think I crashed I think you've crashed the whole place fella.... The power's off Oh, no no no no no no! Oh fuck Oh shit shit shit Crap! Look, I'm a little put out to be honest with you Kyle Well I'm pretty sure i've missed my meeting Woah, Kyle. What the fuck? Please please please please! Get out of the way! Oh shit Please please please please Ah shit - What have you dont to this phone? - NO! Yes! Yeah Oh K.H.Z. Version naught point one K.H.Z? Kyle Henry Zeiger I've done it, I've done it What? Maybe you ought to sit down? I should get moving okay? So.... - You ready? - Yeah Turn it off TURN IT OFF! Okay, okay What the fuck was that? It's your Mom Dude, I can see it's my Mom.... What the fuck was she doing on that screen.... Fucked up like that? It's a recording But, but.... I'm pretty sure.... I can get a real-time interactive version I just need.... More computational power. A huge server Where did she come from? She's here.... Around you. That's her spirit Casey Recorded, processed and displayed Wait, you said this was impossible. Why are you doing this? I think this.... Is my big break This could be my opportunity. My chance! WHAT? I found a bunch of information on the internet.... About people who.... Recorded spirit voices I took it to the next level I sampled the energy in the room. I.... I measured the energy pattern Everything that makes up those spirits All we are is.... code and energy Like DNA. Think of it like 3D DNA Don't you get it? This could be my legacy The Potential is amazing! If I can bring loved ones back from the dead for you.... I can do it for anybody who misses their dead relative Not even humans, maybe.... Maybe even pets? People love dogs right? So imagine being able to call up.... A dead relative or.... Or an ancestor? So.... what.... You could just call up Elvis? Bring him back? No no, It doesn't work like that It's only somebody you have a connection to Kyle, stop Explain to me simply how you got that.... Her, into there? Um, okay, simply simply.... Okay, all life is energy. Okay? And all energy is.... Measureable in electronic terms On a wavelength Now think, when we die.... Where does that energy go? Into thin air? No What else is in the air around us? Radio.... Wi-Fi? Yes! It's a dead-a-phone! Exactly! It's it's It's, it's just a beta version It needs refining for sure but..... Yeah it has massive potential This could be my legacy Can you delete it? Well, sure but why.... DELETE HER, IT, NOW! Could be a killer app Don't you get it? I've spent the last three months.... Wracking my stupid fucking brain Trying to make something out of everything i've been working on I can re-create people Permenant living souveniers Don't you realise how many people would want that? And besides, I finally have something to prove to my Dad Screw your Dad, Kyle I don't give a shit, it ain't right! STOP! That's a unique set-up, what are you doing? FUCK YOU KYLE! You aren't thinking straight I've done this for you It's all for you. All of this! Come on now fella.... Let's calm down Everything's.... Emotionally charged You must realise.... It's a bit overwhelming for Casey Kyle.... I get the sentiment. But.... It's just a bit.... freakapalooza for my dial You get why this could be important right? This.... Could be the most important scientific discovery ever This would make me a genius! I'M DEADLY SERIOUS! OH MY GOD! FUCK! GO GET HELP. CALL 911 FUCK FUCK FUCK KYLE! Wake up, wake up baby come one wake up! SHIT GO GET HELP! CALL 911! WHATEVER YOU HAVE HERE Wait Oh god Kyle fried my phone too Oh god baby I'm so sorry i'm so sorry Wake up!

I'm going to need you to be more precise for me, love You realise the implications here are potentially manslaughter? If there isn't evidence to the contrary Why would I murder my own Boyfriend? I don't believe anyone has used the word murder. Yet But a court might suggest that you and Mr Dalton colluded What? Planned.... Schemed together To get rid of Mr Zeiger, your Boyfriend FUCK YOU!

Us They're hunting us both Hear me out The only possible way.... I can clear my name.... Our names Is if we can prove our innocence But you did do it You killed him You pushed him on the machine.... And then you stopped me from getting help It's your fault. End of story No. That machinery killed him He killed himself in effect Sure.... I retaliated Yes It was an accident If we can show that Then perhaps I could reassure my employers? Save face You are such a fucking douche! Nevertheless.... Surely you realise this is in your interest too? You save me.... You save yourself Dude, I have no idea.... How to use this stuff And you killed the only person who does How are we going to prove it? What the fuck? Kyle told you.... Your Mother's spirit was near you Around If all this does.... Really work Then surely.... We can use this to contact Kyle! Ask him Beg him To tell everyone that I didn't kill him Why do you have this stuff? Shhhhh Kyle said.... He needs more computational power That's how he could fully realise his vision I remember him saying.... The University had the best equipment We take this there We plug it in He gets something We get something Bargain It's the only key to your freedom Whatever He'll probably kill you anyway So, uh..... what's the story? I'm sorry? Well you're clearly not a student So if someone asks what are you? A trust fund manager Hey! Wait! How do you know the number? That's Kyle's handwriting no? ♪ V♪ APP BOOTS UP Kyle?

Complications with the pregnancy.... Birth. His delivery Every paediatrician consulted thought he was.... Once removed somehow Something they couldn't name Pigeonhole They didn't like that They like labels But his mind It was very evident that he was gifted - And I always encouraged him.... - Bullied! Encouraged him to learn more Reach higher. Claw for the heavens Hell, it worked for me This is all your fault Help me help you You bullied him You pushed him too far I owe it to Ky to fulfil his goals Feels cheap Casey, you are no longer under suspicion There's been some surviellance footage supplied.... That alleviates you of any blame I believe some of the forensic tests corroborate this? Allegedly sir, that's right Why are you here? Where is he? Kyle didn't want to startle you Thought you would prefer to see a friendly face That thing is not Kyle! He says he'll kill many many more people Unless you hear him out I cant see him again. Ever If you don't it makes you an accessory to murder Leave that on miss! It's frequency blocking He can't hurt you with that on Where's yours? Ky would never hurt me Casey I need you to prepare yourself Hey Honey No hug? No kiss? Kyle be real with me. What do you want? This has gone too far I want to leave this fucked up body And stay in the afterlife With you Us Together Like the team we always used to be Oh yeah? You just want me to lay down and die? Or what? Are you going to kill me? Sure yeah, let's do that I can't kill you If I kill you we wont be together You wouldn't want me I want you to want to be with me Kyle, this isn't going to work It's like you always say. This is.... Fucking Beta shit! It does work! I think you are underestimating Ky's abilities You can't hurt her. She's dead. Like you! It's a different kind of pain You are pain Total consumption Why? Why her? I needed an insurance policy That's all I didn't mean.... Kyle, what the fuck is going on? Go on Press it So what, if I don't..... Die, You're going to torture my dead Mother? Well well done. You finally get your dad to kiss your ass Kyle You don't care about me Like Father, like Son You never really believed in me Oh Shit!
