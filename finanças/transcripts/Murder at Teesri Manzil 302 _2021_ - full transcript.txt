What's up, Nandu? Why are you smoking outside the hospital? My wife is sick. She's in there. What happened to her? The usual, woman's troubles. Woman's troubles? I'm spending so much... - How much for the cigarette? Rs. 10. - Rs. 10? How many do you have in your pocket? - One more. You have money to die, but not to save your wife from death. What is that nonsense? Look! This has death written all over it. This sanitary pad is about life. Don't laugh. The money for two cigarettes can save your wife from a disease caused by using dirty cloth during periods. You can save yourself from a deadly disease by not smoking too. Buy two lives for what you're paying for death. One is yours and one is your wife's. Think and smile now. Smoking doesn't make you a hero. Giving this, makes you one. - 'Choose life.' Can I? You know you are fit only for one thing. And thank you for that help. I can eat on my own. We should have ordered Chinese. I can't hold the knife, will I be able to handle chopsticks? Give me the check please. - Yes, sir. Nice food. - Thank you, ma'am. That means I must tip you as well as she liked your food. Nice food. Give it here. Sir. There you go. - Thank you, sir. Greetings. - Greetings. Greetings. - Greetings. Anoch. Have you seen my wife? No, sir. Wasn't she with you at lunch? Excuse me, sir. Sir, here are the Oracle files. They are waiting for you at the conference room. Thank you. Hello. Sir, someone called Mr. Chand from National bank wants to speak to you. Maria, I've told you I am done for the day. Please tell them to call tomorrow. Sir, I told him but he said it's too urgent. Tomorrow will be too late. Alright, fine. - Okay, sir. Mister... - Hello. Mr... who are you? Sorry? - I mean, how are you, Mr. Diwan? I am fine, how are you? How can you be fine? What do you mean? - Where's your wife? Who is this? How can you be okay? Is it your wife or someone from your office staff? Who is speaking? Why did you stop talking? Why don't you speak? What can I say? It's not good news. Your wife has vanished. Maya? She's vanished? I kidnapped her. Who is speaking? - Who? George Bush, the president of America. Where is Maya? Let me speak to her. Let me speak to her! Hello! - Maya! Abhishek! - Maya! Maya, don't worry! Everything will be alright. Please, save me, Abhishek. Please. Maya! Quickly tell me, where are you? Tell me. Should I tell you everything on the phone right now? Hello! She is no condition to speak right now. Maya! - You're a strange man. Okay. Write down the address. Or should I SMS it to you? - Hello? Your wife didn't come here. She was brought here. Listen, if anything happens to Maya... - No! No! - Anything happens to her... Nothing will happen to her. I know what she is worth. - No! No! - Maya! Maya! - No, no, no! What's going on? What are you doing? - Putting on some tape. Why are you putting on tape? So she won't scream. Even if I don't get paid at least I can please myself. Hello! Maya, can you hear me? Tell me where you are. Listen, if you do anything to Maya... I swear she's fine. - If anything happens to her... She looks so good, your wife. How much do you want to get paid? What? How much money do I want? How much money do you want How much do you want to get paid? Half a million dollars. What? 5 lakh dollars? Yes. The first installment. - Are you crazy? Don't get shocked at everything that I say! Stop getting shocked. - Are you insane? Arrange for the money. I will tell you when to come and where to come. Are you sure, what happened was exactly what happened, Mr. Diwan? What are you implying? Was your wife kidnapped for real or... Last year a man's wife ran away with her lover. He filed a complaint for kidnapping to spare himself the shame. I handled that case too. Listen... - No, no, no, you listen. And you listen, my colleagues and subordinates. A police officer can only be **** over once, in one case. It won't happen every single time! Tell me something, Mr. Abhishek Diwan. When you saw that your wife is not outside the restaurant what did you do then? Actually, I had an important meeting that is why... That is why you went off to your office, without searching for her. Strange. Listen, I thought, she may have left since she remembered something she had to do. I mean, I didn't take it that seriously. Does your wife do that a lot? What do you mean? Does she vanish from anywhere, at anytime without informing you? No. She doesn't. I don't remember this happening before. Despite that, you did nothing. Do you mean that perhaps she was kidnapped during that time? It's possible. It's all my fault. I should have tried to look for her. Darn this kidnapper. Sir, what do you think? - Yes? Why isn't this darn kidnapper calling? I guess he knows Tejinder Singh is handling this case, now. I have a gut feeling the phone will never ring. That's from my office. - Pick it up. I told you not to call me, unless it's urgent. I will call you back if needed. Sorry, sir, but Mr. Chand called from National Bank about tomorrow's loan... I don't care about... Mr. Chand? Tell me, what's the message? Take it down. - He asked you to call from a landline and dial 8501. Next, you dial 3221257. After that, you dial personal code 1102. - 8501. Done? - Sir, that's the whole message. 1102. Okay, thanks. Find out whose number this is. Trace the call. What? What? This number is blocked? Did you find out anything? Sir, this number is blocked. That can be done by requesting the phone companies. VIPs keep their numbers private by doing that. This is also the number of a private voicemail service. Tracing calls from this is impossible. You mean to say that the kidnapper is a VIP? Sir, should we approach the phone company? - Not now. Please call this number. One moment. This one matches my number. And this personal code, 1102 is Maya's birthday. 11th of February. - Yes. Which means two things. For one, your wife is an Aquarian. Secondly the kidnapper activated the voicemail on your wife's phone. Please call. Please dial your mobile number. Please enter your personal code. You have one voice mail message. Half million dollars. Put it into a shopping bag and seal it with tape. Sit in a taxi. And get to Hyde Park. You have time till 2 pm in the afternoon. If you don't get here then I will consider the deal is off. If anything doubtful happens and if there's a cop with you or anything makes me suspicious then I won't be responsible for anything that goes wrong. Will we get there in time? Will he recognize me? The world is full of married people. Even then he chose your wife to kidnap. That can only mean one thing. He knows you. Another thing. The kidnapper must be watching us. That's why, please don't speak to me. Hello? Malhotra House? Your sister in law will be killed. What? Who is this? Your sister in law, Maya. Your brother Abhishek broke the rule. Now your sister in law will be killed. - What? Who are you? Listen to me! You listen to me. Get all the cash and jewelry in the house and bring it to Kew Station platform number 6, right now. Within 30 minutes. Please try to understand, sir. I don't have money at home. Okay. Naman Malhotra, class 4 B, St. Stephens' School. My son! - Yes. He is with us, too. If you don't get here in 30 minutes I will kill them both. If you try to tell the police or call anyone I will kill them both at once. Please, I get it, sir. I will be there at once. All officers be alert. Go to gate number 2. "My boy..." Do you have any clues? "My boy, watch out... "My boy, the fish has three legs." Ma'am. - Yes? Sir, he's not come yet. "Where can he go? He has to come here!" "He has nowhere else to go, he can only come here." "The fish has three legs." "My boy!" Please wait. Excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Chand. I guess, you are looking for me. I am Abhishek Diwan. And I am not Tejinder Singh. Don't forget that. Thank... thank you very much, God! I thought, you've not bothered to write my destiny properly, but... Thank you very much. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. Greetings, hello, praise the lord. Welcome to Sahyogi Services. I am Shekhar Sharma. The friend for every Indian who lives in Bangkok, a philosopher in need and when the time comes for it, a guide. No matter what the task may be just mention Shekhar Sharma. But for now I can't speak to you on the phone. That's why give your name and number after the beep. Shekhar Sharma will be there in some hours. Hey, ape! This is your landlord Mahender. I want the rent on time this month. If you don't pay in time I will roast you in the clay oven with all the scrap in your room! Hello, Shekhi! I am speaking from 70150. Mrs. Patel! My DVD player doesn't play. It gets stuck. I want to watch 'Shaadi Ke Side Effects.' It was the best! Please? Hey, man! Take the call! You haven't paid the fees for my son, yet. If you have spent the money, tell me! I will never trust you again. This behaviour will get the child rusticated. Then I will lose it! Hi. - Who is this? Maya. - Maya? Maya Diwan? Strange. I just had lunch with my husband. I slipped out quietly while he was paying the bill. Here you are. What is this? Money. - What? Money. Give it to a good lawyer who will get you a divorce. That will be a sensible way to deal with a **** up marriage. Abhishek will never divorce me. Because he would have to pay me a lot of alimony. He would have to give me a share of the property. You give it. You divorce him. You know how difficult it is for women to get a divorce in this country. I have no financial security. I have no social security. Where can I go? On what basis would I go? If Abhishek gets me killed nobody will mourn me. Where is your family? Parents? Siblings? You must have them. India. Once they got me married, they washed their hands off me. They don't care whether I live or die. Shekhar. I want to live my live with someone who I can love. I don't know why I felt when I saw you that you can help me. I don't know how I can trust you so much. Shekhar, can I use your washroom? What? - Can I use your washroom? Washroom? - Yes. Yeah. Straight. Thanks. - But it's not good enough for you. That's okay. Hello, greetings, praise the lord, good day. You ****! Manisha here. Your ex wife, ****! If you have forgotten, ****! You loser! Stop taking credit on my name, immediately! My new boyfriend is a Mafia. You know Mafia? Get it? You know, right? Return all my money that you have taken. Rascal! Give back my money! You ****! I will not leave you! I will not leave you. Is this for real or a dream? That you're here, what you're saying? Is it real or a dream? Is it real? Kidnap! Kidnap! Kidnap! Kidnap! Where do I keep you after kidnapping you? Here? Yes? I have a friend, Akanksha Mishra. Right now, she has gone to the US. She told me to feed the fishes in her aquarium. I have the keys to her house. You've got it all planned. Yes. What if I get killed in your game? Shekhar. You are a very good person. I won't let you be harmed, because of me. If it comes to being martyred I will die, before you. After hearing Manisha's message I felt as if we are sailing in the same boat. I guess, we are going to the same destination. We will talk a lot, at some time if we are at leisure. You can ask about me. I will ask about you. Which flat is it? - 303. 303? Doesn't it have a back door entry? - No. There is no back door. This is what it is. Okay. You go. You go. Won't you come with me, Mr. Sahyogi? I will follow you. Lead the way. First, we must call your husband and tell him that you are... You have been kidnapped. I got ropes to tie you up. - Will you tie me up? I have to! Or it won't seem real. Yes. - Please remember this flat isn't your friend's place. Right? What is it? What are you looking at? There's a wish. - What wish? Close your eyes and wish for anything you want, blow it away. Your wish will come true. What did you ask for? Let's forget about that. You will get free after this, you will get the money. That's it. Okay. Don't touch anything in this house. I mean, the curtains and all should be closed. - Oh, yeah. Don't answer either the phone or the doorbell. But it will be dark at night. Then how do we see? When you need any light, use this. Don't use any lights, when darkness falls. Nobody outside must know there is someone in this room. You won't feed the fish. - Why not? You're kidnapped. How can a kidnapped girl feed them? They will all die, then. Let them die. What matters to you? Your life? Or their lives? I knew it. You won't bathe or change your clothes. Are you saying I won't bathe for 3 days if I am kidnapped for that long? You won't bathe for 10 days, if that's how long you're kidnapped for. I can wash my face at least. - How can a girl who is kidnapped wash her face? Listen, we are not playing this as a game. It's for your freedom and our security. The more seriously we play, the better or we will be exposed. I will be caught. Eat the food I brought and don't eat any junk from the fridge. You will eat this. You must play as sincerely as I am playing. Okay? Promise me. Promise! Will you keep it? I will keep it. Will you really tie me up? When you leave this place and you're free you must have some marks of this place. For people to see. Here. Did you wear this dress at the restaurant? I am sorry. I am ready. What? One moment. Lift this higher. More. You have to suffer a bit. Okay. Give me your hand. Do you see how I am tying it? If you want to go to the washroom you can untie it. Okay. But tie it back when you get back. Okay? I am tying it lightly now. So you can untie it. Okay. - Here, this way. This way. Okay? - Okay. Then this way, okay? - Yes. Can you tie that? Perhaps. Untie it. This way, then this way. - Okay. Okay. Do it. "Let our breath mingle." "Let me hide your body in my arms." "If you ask my heart's desire, I would say" "your time is all mine and I would be lost in you." "I would be lost in you." "I would be lost in you." "Don't keep me waiting." "I can't go on no more." "My heart is pleading." "I am yours for evermore." "This day won't end." "These nights never end." "These moments never cease." "With sweet memories of you, my love." "This heart won't listen." "This heart won't give in." "This heart won't listen." "It's listening to your sweet words, love." "Intoxicating eyes, luscious lips, how can I stay away?" "All your time will be mine and I will be lost in you." "I will be lost within you." "I will be lost within you." "I will be lost within you." "I will be lost within you." Is everything okay? - Oh, God. What? What is it? My God. You look so beautiful! Tied up. A woman who is bound looks so beautiful! Helpless, shocked, traumatized. Astonished. Amazed. - No! No! - Panicky. What are you doing? No! Shekhar! No, no, no! - Here, take that. No! - Yes. Don't be scared. It's okay. - No! When I saw rich and beautiful women go by in huge cars I wondered about their chemistry. What kind of magic is it? I wanted to touch them and see. I used to think what do they look like in bed? I used to want... - No! To find someone has beautiful as you so I would tie her up and love her to death. Hands. - No! Maya, let me! - No! Maya, please. - No! No! Don't stop me! Don't! Okay, try to understand me. - Please. I won't get another chance like this. This kind of apartment with the windows and doors closed. An unknown girl like you. It's like a blind date! - No! Maya... - Don't do this, please. No! - Maya! Please. No, Shekhar! No! - Maya. Shekhar! No, no, no! Can I help you? - Yes. Yeah, this is Chand here from National Bank. Can I speak to Mr. Diwan, please? Mr. Diwan is already through with his day work. Mr. Chand, please call him... No, it's very urgent. Because, tomorrow will be too late and I have to talk to him today. Hold on for a second. This is the truth about being kidnapped. Forgive me. I didn't want to do that. But I want that when you speak to your husband your voice should echo with the terror of being kidnapped. Do you see what it means to be kidnapped? When you speak, now your husband will believe you. - Hello. You can sit up. Who are you? I mean... - Sorry? How are you, Mr. Diwan? - I am okay, how are you? Okay? How can you be okay? - What do you mean? I will call before coming back here. - Okay. I will ring thrice and disconnect. I will ring again, thrice. Open the door only after that. I will know. Ms. Maya, we have the cash. You were right. He came with a cop. But as you said, I went to his sister. I called and got the money. Ms. Maya. Ms. Maya. Where are you? The door is open too. Ms. Maya. Ms. Maya? Hello? Hello. Hey? Ms. Maya? Ms. Maya? You... Ms. Maya? What... Hello. It's easy to make the rules but difficult to follow them. You made rules about not taking calls. Why did you take the call? Just useless. Who is speaking? How do you know? How does it matter? Hello? Hello! Who is speaking? Who did this? - Whoever did it, it's your mistake. No, it's not my fault, I didn't do anything. You kidnapped that girl. No! I didn't kidnap her. It was a drama. She told me to do this. - Did she tell you to hogtie her? Yes, no, no, I tied her up so that... Hello! Hello, listen to me. It was done so it seems real. I didn't want to do that. The fact is you are implicated in this girl's murder. What do you mean by that? I didn't do anything! Right now you're near the body. Yes, so what about that? The police will answer that, in gangsta style. Hello! Hello! One moment. Wait. One moment. Wait. I haven't done anything. What do you want? Do something for me. Dispose of the body, that's all. I won't do it! I didn't do anything! I didn't harm that girl! I won't do it! You did it, ****! You did it. I... hello! Hello? - Okay, then go to jail. What? Jail? - I just have to call the police. That a girl was heard screaming in 303. Hello. One moment, sir. Sir, what do you want? What should I do? Okay, I will do it. What do you want? Dispose of the body. The body. Hello! Hello, anybody out here? Who are you, sir? What do you want? - Don't you know, rascal? Listen, whoever you are, you should know a police car is following me. If they come here, it will be trouble or you, do you understand? Please, move this out of here at once. Who else will you get out of the way, rascal? Who else? Stop it. Mr. Chand. Mr. Chand from National Bank? Listen to me, please. Where is Maya? Listen, I... I... I beg and beseech you, please! Is Maya alright? Send Maya back. Listen to me. I have made a huge mistake. I told the police. I won't tell the police, please. I will pay you all you want. Please, please send my wife back. Please send my wife back. - Hey! I can't live without my wife. Listen, whatever your price I will give you twice the amount of money. But please send Maya back to me. Please send my wife back to me. Please! Please, please. Please send her back to me. - Mr. Diwan! Mr. Chand... - Mr. Diwan. Are you okay? Who are you speaking to? Mr. Chand! Mr. Chand? - Mr. Chand! Out here... Mr. Chand. - Where is he? Who is it? Why did you come here? - Who was here? The kidnapper came here. He was telling me about Maya. - What? Oh, God! Oh, God! Listen, all of you must leave me and do something. - I... I want my wife back! I want Maya back! Did you see his face? His height, weight, build, any other description? - No! No, I could not see his face. But he was about 5 feet 11 inches. 5 feet 11 inches? Okay, go home. We will look into the matter, okay? How many Indians of 5 feet 11 inches are in Bangkok? Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. Hello, greetings, praise the lord. Welcome to Sahyogi Services. I am Shekhi as in Shekhar Sharma. A friend to every Indian in Bangkok, a philosopher in need and guide when the time comes. I can solve all your problems. No matter what the task, Shekhar Sharma can do it. But for now it's not possible to speak to you over the phone. That's why, leave your name and number after the beep. Shekhar Sharma will be there within some hours. Manisha here. Are you alive or did you die? Where are you hiding, cowardly man? I need my money now! Call me back or else... Yes, tell me. - Hello? Hello! Manisha here. Manisha. - What are you saying? I need my money. How much money do you want? - Not money, dollars. Okay, how much do you want? I want dollars, not money! What? - Dollars. Yes, dollars. How many? - Can't you hear me? How many dollars do I owe you? Listen, if I do the accounts you've to pay me at least 50,000 dollars. But I know what you are good for. So give me the maximum that you can. Where are you? - Why? Where are you? - Why? Where are you? - In dad's house! Okay, I am coming. You seem to be in a rush, mister. Yes, I am in a hurry. - Uh huh. You're Hari, I'm Prasad, she's Chaurasia. Let's play a flute. I will play the flute for you later, right now I am in a rush. Okay? Stay right here. What is your problem? - You seem to be the one who has a problem. What's in the bag? What does the bag contain? - What? What do you care, what's in the bags? Does it have anything to do with you, what's in the bag? That's why we are asking. Oh! I am sorry, I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry. I will play it for you, sir. It's the wrong way around. I told you it's the wrong way around. Okay, sir. Now. Sir, can I play something else? God help me. Why can't I remember? Okay, someone is waiting for me at Seffen Taxen. I have to go. Can I leave, sir? - Oh, yeah. Can I leave? - Who is waiting? Maya Diwan? So, you kept Ms. Maya Diwan in Seffen Taxen, Mr. Chand from National Bank. Actually, that's my wife there. Maya Diwan, I... - What a strange man you are. Day before Mr. Diwan called you to Hyde Park for the money and you didn't come. And last night, you went off without anything. You didn't even call! What kind of kidnapper are you? Sir, I can explain, I... I am... - Stand straight. - Stand up. Stand straight. - No! Stand straight. - I will stand straight, sir. I can understand what you mean, sir. Maya, I kidnapped Maya Diwan. Sir, 5' 11 and a half. - I... Sir, I... - He's half an inch taller. Someone else planned it. - He may be wearing heels. Yes, sir, but logically in this weather at this time of the night nobody will go to meet anyone without wearing shoes, right? I am wearing shoes! - You got a point. I am wearing shoes... - Go on. Where should I go, sir? - You can go. Where should I go? - Seffen Taxen. Go on. Are you sure? - Yes. Can I go? - Yes. You can go. - Go. Hello! - We said, you can go. - Hello! - Are you in a hurry? Yes, of course. You're Hari, I'm Prasad, he is Chaurasia. Let's play a flute. Good afternoon. The sky train from Seffen Taxen will go from platform number two. The train coming from Seffen Taxen is arriving at it's due time. On platform number four. Maya! Maya! Will go from platform number two. There is a slight delay... The inconvenience caused to passengers... Maya.Wait. Maya! Maya! Maya. Hey, Maya! Maya. Where are you going, brother? - Hey, that... She will get down. You can't study. Then why it come to Thai? It's written up there, to Seffen Taxen. Going to it. Not from Seffen Taxen. The train to your in law's place goes from here. Not there. Do you understand? Okay. ?? Mrs. Diwan was kidnapped days ago. We have no clues so far. We must seek the media and public's help. Media? No! Please, we can't do this. He will kill Maya. Listen, Mr. Diwan, you try and understand. - There is a proverb. No news is good news, but not always. The kidnapper has fallen silent this way. It can be dangerous, not a good sign. Do you think someone can kill Maya for the measly amount of Rs. 500,000? Unless we identify the kidnapper it's impossible to answer that question. But for now to get to the kidnapper we have to take the help of the media and the public. If you allow it. The ball is in your court. Yes. Please. Sir. Do only Indian folks stay here? - Yes, mostly. I want to meet your building secretary. Where is he? Sit, please. Let me call him. Sir, sit in the society office. Hello, sir. I am Rana. Hello. - Manager of the society. How can I help you? I want to check the lease agreement of room 303. Sit, please. Let me find it. Sir, is there some problem with 303? No, nothing, just regular verification. Here you are, sir. This is made out to some modeling agency for a lease agreement. Some girl lives here. Yes, sir. Priya Mehta lives here. Oh. Akanksha Mishra? She lives in 302. Yes, give me her file. - Okay, sir. First, an important announcement for all Asian comrades. Mrs. Maya Diwan, wife of the famous Bangkok business tycoon Abhishek Diwan has been missing since some days now. The police assumes it's a kidnapping. - Take the file. The police believe the kidnapper is either from India or Pakistan. He identifies himself as Chand over the phone. This man... Akanksha Mishra lives in 302? - Yes, sir. Is the agreement signed with her? - Yes, sir. These two are made out to the same modeling agency. This is made out to the same agency? - Yes, sir. The address of the modeling agency. - Let me give it to you. Mrs. Diwan was last seen at the Bangkok Sheraton Hotel. She was wearing a red designer gown. Mr. Diwan has announced a reward to the one providing information. Now, let's watch the next song. Hello. - Hello. I'm from Ad Bangkok. I believe Akanksha Mishra is represented by you? Yeah but she is not available here, right now. Could I see her portfolio, show reel or anything? Sure, I'll arrange it for you. Hey, get Akanksha's portfolio. Yeah, sure. What about Priya Mehta? Is she with you? - She's here. I will let you meet her. Okay. Priya.- - Yeah. Hey, someone from Ad Bangkok. What ad is it? - Cosmetics. Wow! Which brand? It's a new brand. - So it's TV, print or... TV. I will do my best. Do you live in 303 in Cosmic Tower? Next to Akanksha Mishra's flat? No actually, the lease for 303 is in my name. But Akanksha lives there. We interchanged due to some numerological reasons. But I live next door to her. Are you her friend? Yes. I guess, you're her boyfriend? No! No. - I have heard that lately she hasn't been working much. Ever since the news spread she slept with her client she hasn't been getting too many calls. She slept with her client? Who is the client? Here, thank you. I guess, you want her. It's okay. Never mind. Thank you. You look so lovely! Beautiful! Oh! No! Bring it. I will tell you when to come. Where to come. No! Hello. - I hope you like the trailer. If you don't stop searching this movie will be broadcast worldwide. Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Shekhar. I also want to live my life with a man who I can love. Looking at you it seems as if Manisha is unlucky she lost you. What if I get martyred in your game? If it comes to being martyred then I will die before you. Akanksha. Come here, darling. Is it safe to meet here, Abhishek? Relax. I myself don't know where we are. I have not seen you for so many days. Haven't you been sleeping? No. - Why? I was missing you. Are you sorry? - About what? There are cops posted outside your house, constantly. You should sleep well today. I took all this risk and came here to sleep. With you. What about the status of the police investigation? The police investigation is circling around. That's why I got the most foolish officer on board the investigation. But he is still a cop. Akanksha. The cops are meant to help politicians and elite folks. Do you understand? Thank God. Abhishek, I need to speak to you about something. We can keep talking for the rest of our lives. Please, Abhishek. It's urgent. Please. - Not now. Later. No, Abhishek. It's bothering me like hell - I said, later. I am not here to speak. I am not one of mistresses. If you speak to me like Maya... At least let me shower. Hurry up, baby. We are going to rock tonight.

Whoever you are I won't let the story end here. What is it? What? Nothing. What is it? I felt as if Who is it? - It's... What? Akanksha? Where is your family? Parents? Siblings? They must be around. I don't know if my wife is unlucky or not. But Abhishek is truly unlucky. What if I get martyred in your game? Hey, gorgeous. Come and hold my legs. Come and hold my legs! What is it? Was I very rough with you, today? You know the joy you get Maya has never had that. You're a lucky babe. What is it? You're very cold today. I am running out of patience, Abhishek. How long can I stay away from the city? Isolated? I am frustrated. I can't live like this, now. Is that all? Don't worry. Everything will be alright. Just like it used to be. Tell me something. Was it your idea to take money from my sister, the other day? Yes. Why? Poor Sahyogi needed money. He had high hopes from the money he'd get from you. Anyway, the cops were with you. That's why I gave him your sister's number. The poor guy got the money and the kidnapping drama became a bit more convincing. I hope you're not in love with him. Yes? Did you sleep with him for real? To make the kidnapping more convincing? You're insulting me, Abhishek. I am simply saying if he tries to act smart with me, I'll kill him. I will kill him, do you understand? Where was this courage the other day, Abhishek? When Maya came to my place? Are you okay? Should we go to the clinic? - No! Do you have something to bind this? A rope or something? - Yeah, yeah. ****! Darn. Maya, stop. Let me go, Abhishek! Maya, listen to me. - I won't leave this ****! Maya, stop it! Maya, stop! - I will never... Maya! Stop it, listen to me. - Leave me. Leave me! - Maya. Maya, listen to me! Leave me. - Maya. Abhishek, let her go. She will die! Listen to me, Maya. It's not what it seems. Listen to me, Maya! She'll die! Let her go, Abhishek! Let her go! Maya. Listen to me. Listen! Did you find something? Did you find anything? Hurry up! It's bleeding a lot. - Yes. Tight! Bind it tightly. Yes. - Hurry, hurry, hurry. ****! God! ****! She hurt me while dying! I am glad I got rid of her. "Chants." "Chants." - ****! "Chants." "Chants." What do we do now, Abhishek? Abhishek, talk to me. What can we do? We call the cops! That's it. The cops? Why? - Because it's a case of self defense. I will call Tiwari. He will sort it out. Self defense? Akanksha! - Wait. This is a murder, in my house. She is your wife. How am I related to you? - Akanksha! Your mistress. Please don't start. - What? You will get away with it. What will happen to me? I will be defamed! My career will end, everything will end for me! Like Maya, my dad didn't leave behind millions of rupees so that I can marry a double MA like you! - Akanksha! Shut up! You don't know what caste are you. You don't know. A tiny locality in Indore. I am the third daughter of a poor man. I boasted a lot when I came here. I boasted a lot! I will do this, and that! I didn't come here to become your mistress! Why did you come here, then? I didn't come here to get implicated in her murder! I didn't come to be in handcuffs! - What do you want? What should I do? Should I toss her dead body out into the street? That's Maya Diwan you're talking about! The whole city knows her! Remember this. I am nothing without Maya Diwan. Nothing at all! Abhishek? Maya Diwan is around! What? Do you remember you once said I look like your wife? When did you feel that? Tell me, Abhishek. Once when you wore heavy make up for some campaign and got ready with straight hair. You said, the name is Maya Diwan, right? - Yes. It's an old fashioned name. But for now you have to make do with that. No, the name... what's in a name? It's a nice name. Good name. You didn't tell me what it's about. You have a solution to every problem. Right? - Yes. I mean, I think that if there is any problem the solution to it must exist. I like your energy. - Energy? My... - Your positive attitude. I am happy to meet people who are so confident of themselves. If the client starts praising before telling me what to do, it means the job is tough. It's not easy. - Does the difficult task scare you? No, no. I am human after all, not a god. Tell me, what do you want done? Why did you send for me? You can tell me. Trust me. I won't leak your secrets out. Thanks. I want you to kidnap me. What? Ask my husband for a ransom to give me back. Are you joking? I am serious. I will pay you 100,000 dollars for this. I have brought 50,000 right now. Hold, hold, hold! 100,000 dollars? I have never seen that in my entire life. I may be a temp worker but you can't pay me and get just about anything done. I can place a bomb at Bangkok airport. I am not a professional criminal. Neither am I. I am the wife of a big time industrialist of this country. So far I am. - Okay. I am not committing a crime. I just need your help. Is this what you call help? Sorry, I can't help you. Because I have never helped anyone this way before. I don't even want to. Anyway. Thank you for getting me out of bed so early. And hired me for a job that will keep me laughing all day. Thank you very much, bye. In some days, you will hear the news. Maya Diwan dead due to suicide or hanging... It won't be true. Abhishek Diwan will have had her killed. Go on, my friend. Don't feel too much regret when you read the news. I guess, Maya is unlucky. "Who's it?" "Tell me. Who is it?" "Who is it?" "Oh, my." "Who is it?" "Place your lips against me, like I am a flute." "Have me dance to the tunes of a flute." "Have me dance to the tunes of a flute." "Dial 10066." "I am a toll free girl. Call me when you want." "Call me anytime." "I am a toll free girl." Akanksha? The stage is ready, the dancers are ready. While you are still here! You're not even ready! Come on! Hurry up! We don't have time. Have you ever been in love? - What? Those who love you you should never deceive them. We have only two minutes. It's a live show, dammit! Do you understand what that means? I can't do this. I am sorry. - What? Oh, my God! Akanksha has gone crazy. She's refusing to perform. Please inform the boss also. I don't know. "Youth has many battles." "I have crazy guys hovering around me." "Someone says. - What's going on?" "Someone says. - You're the bomb." "Someone says... - Yeah, oh!" "They are all players. None of them will take me home." "Dial 10066." "I am a toll free girl. Call me any time you want." "Call me. Just call me." "I am a toll free girl. Call me any time you want." "Call me. Just call me." What should I call you? Maya Diwan or Akanksha Mishra? Or is there any other name? What's your real name, baby? Hey! Hey! Oh, Maya! Hey, don't run, girl! Maya! Akanksha! Don't run. Hey! Hey! Hey, catch her! She's taken my wallet. Maya! Hey! So, Run Lola Run. After all that running, give me your real name. I was running so that you'd catch me. I was waiting for you. You took so long! I was getting nervous! Tell me something. Why did you choose me, out of the blue? Was I the only one you could find in this huge city to include in your heinous and evil play? Yes? Not just the city, you are the only one in the entire world. I could only trust you. I told you so, right? Did you reward me for it? You said given the chance you'd get killed instead of me. You arranged to get me hanged! Listen to me, Shekhar. - What did you think? You would get down and dirty with that rascal. While I roam the city like some fool? But Shekhar... I feel as I've been branded on the forehead bloody loser! Look, there goes a fool! Use him. Please don't say that, Shekhar. You were merely a coincidence. You were just a chance. I never wanted to deceive you. Certainly not after meeting you. I am feeling worse for you then you feel, Shekhar. Do you feel bad? When my wife cheated me, I didn't feel quite so bad. You are worse than her! There are plenty of bodies in this city. Maya, Akanksha or whoever you are. I thought you're more than a body. But it was all a lie. It's all a lie. My entire life is a lie, Shekhar. It's made up. But the day we spent together is' for real. And it's true even today. Are you in love with me? Girl, I feel like cursing you so badly! So you never remember any other word apart from it. You went too far. Some limits are still left, Shekhar. I have a plan. - Stop it! Stop it. There is no plan. There is no plan. Now you will just tell me this. What's the deal and what is this game about? Come on. "These moments say" "if this moment can stop" "we could speak from the heart." "We can speak from the heart." "Whenever tears well up" "at the corners of your eyes." "Whenever tears well up" "at the corners of your eyes." "I will take on your tears." "Come to me." "Make me feel." "Come to me." "Make me feel." "Come to me." "Make me feel." You will have to be Maya once again, Akanksha Mishra. The game will begin again. The chessboard will be set out again. The only difference is, the last time I was your pawn. Now it's me control and you will be my pawn along with Abhishek. "How can you mend a broken heart?" "How can you mend a broken heart?" "These burning eyes" "How can these burning eyes glisten with tears?" "I will take on your tears." "I am the one you are in love with." "Take my hand and say." "I am the one you are in love with." "I will love you once again." "I am the one you're in love with." "Take my hand and say." "I'm the one you're in love with." "I am the one who is in love with you." Wow. You look great. You should always be dressed as Maya. How did you know I am dying to have sex with my dead wife? Right here in this car? Under the stars? Come on, Maya. Come on! Think before you speak, Abhishek. I am not here as Maya Diwan. I was sent here. What do you mean? Our trap has backfired on us. He's found us out. Sahyogi? - Right. ****. Did he say anything to you? - No. Did he force you? - Not at all. Did you tell him anything? What does he want? 1 million dollars. I get it. I will give him that money and a never ending debt begins. I will give him a million today. He will ask for one million in future and then another. I won't allow that beggar to blackmail me. What can you do then? I am going to kill him. If I can kill once, I can kill twice. Maya deserved it. So does this ****. If I could kill Maya I can kill this beggar too. I am going to kill him. Hey! What is it? - Nothing. You're right. Go kill him. You are a trained killer anyway. You can't dispose of a body and you say you'll kill him! Oh, God, Akanksha! What did I get trapped into? I wish, all of this were just a bad dream. And I wish Maya was still your wife and I was your mistress! I wish we would have deluded ourselves forever that everything would get better on it's own! Right? Maya would accept me and give all your property to you and get out of our lives, happily. Wow! I wish I had been born in a highborn family! I wish, my dad wore a suit not a dhoti kurta! I wish! I wish, I were most famous! Most rich! I wish, all my dreams would come dream. I wish, my life would be most beautiful! Abhishek! I wish... But that isn't going to change reality. One million dollars is worth way more than he deserves. How can he ask for anymore than that? Listen to me. As long as this case is open, the problem is huge. When this case closes we will be untouchable and secure. Akanksha! Don't you feel scared? While you are around, how can I feel scared, Abhishek? Very interesting. What is the third leg on the fish like? Why did you bring the gun? It's game over for him today. Have you lost it? What if it doesn't end? I have this. Mr. Sahyogi. Mr. Sahyogi. Mr. Sahyogi. What is that stench? All my fish died, Abhishek. Are you sure he called us here? Hello? - No matter who makes the rules but everyone must follow them, Mr. Tiwari. Mr. Sahyogi. I am glad you recognize me. That's amazing. Very good. I don't believe in wasting time. Your time is precious, indeed. But that's when you are lucky. Right now, I think you're going through a bad phase. I'm paying, don't imagine that makes me weak. That's a mistake. No! Mistakes are made by the lowlifes like us. People like you aren't meant to make mistakes. But you've already made one mistake, don't make another. Did you get my stuff? Yes, I did. - Give it to your beloved. Tell her to get out of the window and come into 302 through the window. I am paying. I will come. - Give it to her! What will I do with you, bloody murderer? Wife killer! Can you prove that? I don't know yet what I can do or not do. Okay, do you have a mobile? A cellphone? Do you have a cellphone on you? You have got a message on it, just check it. Check it. Check it. I am going to kill him. I am going to kill this ****. If I can kill once, I can kill twice. Maya deserved it. So does this ****. If I can kill Maya then I can kill this beggar too. I am sorry, I had to. I am sure you like the movie. Do you remember showing me something, the other day? I will show you something today. Now you will do as I say. Business is done on equal terms, Mr. Diwan. I made a deal with you on your own terms. Today, you will make it on my terms. I trust, this will be our last and final deal. Yes, the last. Hold this. Don't feel guilty, baby. Even if it were someone else besides you, we'd have to do this anyway. After all you can see what he is making me do, right? Listen to me. Take this with you. Use it, if needed, okay? We will handle the rest of the details, later. This won't be needed, Abhishek. Who knows? We may need it. Keep it. I know him. All he wants is money. - Don't argue with me. I am sorry, you can take care of yourself. But do it for us. For one last time, okay? Alright. Come on, now. Go. Akanksha took the money. Akanksha always goes away with the money. What do you mean? Why? You live with her. Don't you know what her name means? It means, wish, desire, longing. She always takes the money and leaves! Listen, I've done what you said. I trust you will give me the evidence you have now. I only have one piece of evidence. I will give it to you, today. Go to the washroom. The proof is waiting for you. The washroom? - Go in. Mr. Diwan! - Mr. Diwan! Mr. Diwan, open the door! - Open it! Mr. Diwan! - Please open the door! Open the door, Mr. Diwan! - Open the door. Mr. Diwan! Mr. Diwan! Mr. Diwan, what is the matter? Hey! What is it? Sir! Sir, please come in at once. Oh, my God! Akanksha doesn't only go with the cash, she comes too! But I told you I would come with the money. Alright. For a change, I have won a game. Did you win, or not? - Shekhar, we won. Both of us. It's only because we stood by each other. Well, let me believe you once again. And... begin a new journey with you. Okay? "Let our breath mingle." "Let me hide your body in my arms." "If you ask my heart's desire, I will say to you" "your time is all mine and I will be lost in you." "I will be lost in you." "I will be lost in you." "These moments belong to us." "The rest are dreams." "Let's live these passing moments, my love." "What you say, with longing eyes." "Your bright eyes scare me, my love." "I am enchanted. What should I do?" "Your time is all mine and I will be lost in you." "I will be lost in you." "I will be lost in you." "I will be lost in you." "I will be lost in you."
