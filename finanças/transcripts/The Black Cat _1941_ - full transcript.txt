- Oh, stop it, Richard. Sounds like a funeral dirge. - So what? This waiting is getting on my nerves. - How is she, Doctor? - You'll be pleased, I'm sure, to know that Mrs. Winslow is still violating all the laws of science. She should be dead, but she's very much alive. - Oh, I'm so glad. - We all are. - Yes, of course. - Well, I must be getting back to town. - Thank you for everything, Doctor. Abigail will get your coat for you. Oh Ab... - As an antique dealer, Mr. Penny, what do you think of this road? - Oh, I'd hate to meet the worms that made those holes, woohoo. - Well, we're almost there. - I still think we should wait until after the funeral. - No, Hartley hasn't got a sentimental bone in his body. He told me this morning, it was only a matter of minutes before Henrietta Winslow's death, and if I wanted to make a deal for the estate, I better bring an offer from my client tonight. - It's shocking, shocking. - What do you mean, selling that house while the dead rattler's still rattling? - Precisely. - Hartley's a bit of a rattler himself. - Are you sure the relatives wanna sell the furniture too? - Wanna sell it? They're so anxious to cash in and get out, we'll be lucky if they don't leave the body there. - Terrible, terrible. Everybody's money mad, everybody's money mad. Including me. Well, here we are. Money in the bank for me, antiques from cellar to attic for you. I hope they're in bad condition. People always pay double for antiques supporting the part. - Yeah? - Yeah. Are you sure this is the place? - Sure I am, this house is over 100 years old, I used to play around here when I was a kid. Yeah, well, it didn't stunt your growth. - Oh, you talk as if the place was haunted or something. Come on, let's ring for Eduardo. - Oh, what's that, what's that? "That house is doubly blest" "Which to the feline friend gives rest." Oh, poetry, that's beautiful, beautiful. - That's what Mrs. Winslow says. But as kids, we used to say "in her hats are many bats" "for spending all her dough on cats." Ole. - Hi Eduardo, you haven't changed a bit since last time I saw you. - Terrible thing, terrible. - Oh, he means it's a terrible thing about Mrs. Winslow. Eduardo, open the gates, come on, open 'em up, open 'em. - No. - Pals from way, way back. - These gates stayed locked since car killed cat. Mrs. Winslow's orders. - Now Eduardo, I'm not a man to bicker over a small thing, I'll let that go. Open the pedestrian gates, I have a date with Mr. Hartley. - Come on, Penny. - Yeah. - Go on, go on, go on. - I thought you told me this deal was all set. - It's in the bag like I told you in the car. Dough in the bank for me, antiques for you. I got a check right here for $25,000, and Mr. Hartley said... - This place will never be sold. Never! - Well, you can't kill a guy for tryin'. Or would you? - Boy. - Oh. Looks like it's been raining cats and cats around here. You see? You're catching cold, you shoulda put your overs on. I oughta tell your mother. - It isn't a cold. Cats, Eduardo was right, I'm allergic to 'em. Every time I get close to a cat I start coughing. - I hope they've scratched up all the furniture. I'll make a fortune if they did. - And outta here before they want dessert. Well, this is it. Must be that vitamin B1 I been takin' lately. - Knock a little harder, maybe the hinges will come off. - Here comes Abigail, housekeeper. - I hope she isn't like Eduardo. Abigail, don't worry about her, she's a sweetie. Hello, sweetheart, how are you, Abby? - Miss Abigail, please. Go away. We don't like you. A lovers' quarrel. - Now wait a minute, Miss Abigail. - You threw rocks at the cats. - He did, you did, oh, shame on you, shame on you. - That was 15 years go! - I don't care if it was yesterday. Go away. - What a puss, like a lemon rinse. What did you say? - Who, me? - Yes, you, little man. - Oh, I said what a puss, a puss, a pussycat. Here pussy, pussy, pussy. What's the matter, don't anybody like you around here? - They love me. But you gotta expect treatment like that from servants. Naturally they don't wanna see the house sold. - I thought you told me the deal was all set. - Leave everything to little Gilly, will ya? The tougher the opposition, the harder I hit the line. - Supposing you fumble. - Not a chance. Now look, I'll tell you what we'll do. Reverse our field, go around left end, and get in the back way. The deal will be set like that. - What is that? - Where? Oh, over there? That's the crematory. - Crematory? - Yeah, for the cats. - Come on, I'll show you. - The cats? - Sure, everything around here is for the cats, that's why the place has gone to the dogs. - Oh, that's pretty bad. I'm glad I didn't say that, woohoo. You wouldn't believe it, would ya? - I don't. Woohoo. Are we alone, are we alone? - Sure we're alone, stop worrying. Oh, old lady Winslow considers a black cat a symbol of death. And here's the furnace. She had it made big enough so that when she dies, she can be cremated here and have her ashes put with the cats. Beautiful thought, beautiful thought. - Oh, those urns. - Oh, a Ming. - Yeah? - Second Dynasty. - Oh, that's bad, huh? - Oh, that's good. - Oh, well this is only the beginning, they got some Ming stuff in the house that'll kill you, come on. - Woohoo, woohoo. That's it, that's it. The old lady stay here all alone? Alone? Why, she's got more relatives hanging around than a dead sheep has vultures, all trying to get their hands on her dough. - Another false alarm. - Now Richard, that's no attitude to take. The important thing is that your grandmother's out of danger. - Do you expect me to believe that, Monty? You're disappointed and you know it. - Grandmother, what are you doing out of bed? - I wanted to be in the bosom of my loving family. Well you go right back to your room. You're still a sick woman, you know. Elaine, that's no way to talk to your grandmother. - Stop the apple polishing, Monty. Grandmother isn't gonna loan you any money. - What do you mean, talking to me like that? - Keep quiet. - That's her, Henrietta Winslow. - She's dead? - Yeah. No no no, she's fooled 'em again. She's got more lives than her cats. - Oh, I can't wait that long. Come on, let's go. - Wait a minute, come here. - This must be a sad occasion for all of you. You came to bury me, and now you feel you have to stay and praise me. Since my paralysis, you've all come running to my bedside every time I had a stomachache. Well, I've decided to read my will and set your minds at rest. - You're being impossible, Grandmother. - Don't interrupt. I, Henrietta Winslow, being of sound mind and... You'll see that I am of sound mind, Margaret, when I get to you. Being of sound mind, and sensible of the uncertainty of life, and desirous of disposing of my property and affairs, do hereby make the following bequests. To my devoted niece, Myrna Hartley, I will and bequeath the sum of $100,000. - Oh, thank you, Aunt Henrietta. - That's all right, my dear. You've been less trouble than the rest. To Montague Hartley, my niece's husband, in appreciation of his loyal devotion to his wife, I bequeath $10,000. - That's most generous of you, Henrietta, thank you. - He should've been an actor. To Richard Hartley, my niece Myrna's stepson, I bequeath $10,000 to enable him to continue with his chemical research. - Why that's very kind of you, Grandmother. - To my granddaughter, Margaret Gordon, I bequeath $100,000. Not because she merits any consideration on my part or needs the money, but because I know she would call me insane and try to break my will if I neglected her. - That's a little far-fetched, Grandmother. - Is it? Remember, walls have ears. To my grandson, Stanley Graybill, I bequeath likewise $100,000, as consolation because he did not inherit any of the brilliant architectural sense of his father, who did such excellent work in reconstructing this home to suit my whims and fancies. - Well, some consolation prize. I'm getting more out of the estate than Father did. - Suspense is killing Elaine. - Tomorrow faithful gardener, Eduardo Vigos, I bequeath $5000. To my granddaughter Elaine, I bequeath my home and the 50 acres of land on which it is situated, as well as the residue of my estate. - Thank you, Grandmother. I'm sorry. - Don't apologize for anything. You inherited your selfishness from me. That's why I'm favoring you. - Favoring's rather a mild word, isn't it? Why, the furnishings alone are worth as much as the house and grounds. - Did you hear what she said about the furniture? - Yeah, but you can't buy the furniture while she's still alive. - While there's like there's hope. As long as we can't deal with the relatives, maybe we can talk Henrietta into selling. - A. Gilmore Smith, I'd know that cough anywhere. Gil Smith, come in here! - Get back there and keep outta sight. I'll get the lowdown. My, how you've grown. I've gotten a little heavier, too. - Yeah. You all remember little Gil Smith. - How are you, everybody? Don't get up. Hello, Elaine, I heard you were in town, I kinda hoped I'd see you around. - I've been meaning to look you up, Gil, really I have. I was gonna make you buy me a sundae at Miller's Malts... - Pardon me. Had one with me. But it seemed important. Oh, no no, I guess I'm not in as good condition as I used to be. - I think you look grand. - Put her here, Mr. Smith. - Oh, hi, Mr. Hartley. - Glad to see you. - Glad to see you too. Oh, sure, sure, I get it. - Gil, I want a word with you. The rest of you can go away, and talk about me behind my back. But don't wander far. There are still a few details you might be interested in. Montague, you'll stay. - Here. And don't throw it away again. Eduardo says you're ruining his plants. - I won't. But I'd like you to taste it first. - You don't trust anyone, not even me. - Sit down. Now then, Gil, don't deny it. The only thing that would bring you here, among my cats, is an offer for the house, right? - Well, I... - So you couldn't wait. You tried to sell me out on my deathbed. - Now Henrietta. It was because you were ill, and to spare you the trouble. Mr. Smith insisted that there was an exceptional offer, so I consented to see him on your account, isn't that right? - Yes, no, I... - Stop stammering. So long as you've made the trip here, I'll listen to your proposition. Has your client got the money? - Are you kiddin'? Here, hold this. I got a check right here in my pocket for $25,000 as a deposit. Listen, "paid to the order of the estate of Henrietta" "Winslow." - The estate of Henrietta Winslow. - The wording is a little premature. - Get out of my sight. - But Henrietta... - Get out! Gil, I'm sorry to spoil a good dealing for you, but I'll never sell my home. - Now Henrietta, listen. This is a golden opportunity. It's not every day you'll find a client nuts enough to buy this place, I mean nuts enough about the place to buy it. - That come outta me? Woohoo. Oh. As old as me. - What are you doing? - Oh, this is a very good copy. I could make it look like a real antique. All it needs is a few wormholes. I'll fix it up in a minute, here. There's a hole for many worms. - Henrietta, listen, will ya? - Gil, you're an ambitious boy, and I like you for it. But don't hope for Elaine. Why not? - Elaine takes after me, and that means she'll never marry any man without money. - I don't believe it. And besides, how am I gonna make any dough if you won't listen to reason? What's the matter, I'll fix it for you. Lean forward a little. That's it. There, is that better? That's better. Thank you. - Come on now, Henrietta. Drink your milk. - Oh, no. I detest the stuff. You drink it, Gil. - You drink it, it's good for ya. - It's only good for hair and teeth, and mine are false. - Pardon me, is Elaine around? - Yeah, she went in there. Let's get down to business now, come on. - Just for that lie, you'll drink every drop. - Oh no. - Oh, please. I don't want Abigail nagging at me. - I'm not kidding with this cough. Those cats, they kill me. I don't know how you can pass up an opportunity like this, Henrietta. Honestly I don't. Only comes once in a lifetime. After all, I am only interested in your welfare, you know. Oh, now you sound like one of my relatives. - But I mean it. Now you would be happier in a little apartment in town, wouldn't ya? - Could I take my cats with me? - Well... - Ah, you see. It's no sue, Gil. I've built my life around this house. And I've added a shrine as a final resting place for my pets. And when my time comes, I want to join them there. - That's final? All right, but I don't have to drink your milk for you, here. Come on, come on, now take it. That stuff is poison to me. Don't drink that! - Gil! - When I said poison, I meant it, look! - Oh, the poor, poor kitty. - That could've been you, or me! - No difference. The life of the smallest animal is as sacred as our own. - Yeah? Evidently nothing is very sacred to one of those relatives of yours. - Well, whoever it was would've had an awful shock if I had died. They were so satisfied with what they thought they were going to get, that they didn't wait to hear the end of the will. - I thought I broke in on the end of it. - You broke in, but not at the end. There was another clause, a most important one. Nobody inherits a penny until Abigail and the cats are dead. - Look, you better read that to the rest of the family before something else happens around here. I'll get 'em. Look, stay here. And don't drink anything! Eddie! - Poor child. Well, come along, we'll join your ancestors. - Richard, Elaine! Mr. Penny, what are you doing? - I couldn't help it. This poor, innocent, sweet girl, innocent as the day is long. Look how she's been framed. - Look, the deal hasn't been set yet, so will you cut it out? - I don't have to cut it out, I've can rip it out. See that? Elaine! - Goodbye, little friend. So it must be with all of us. How did you know about that? No. - Gil! - Did you hear that scream? - It came from in there. - Grandma, Grandma! She must've fallen on it. Poor dear. A black cat. Where could it have come from? Probably wandered out from the house. - No, Grandmother never allowed a black cat on the place. - Henrietta knew that whom a black cat follows, dies. You're crazy, I hope. - You'll see. You'll see. It's going up to the house. - Under the circumstances, it will not be necessary to hold a formal inquest. When I return to my office, I will issue a death certificate. - Thank you, Coroner. An inquest would be distressing for the ladies. - The accident was most unfortunate. My heartfelt sympathies to you all. She was a fine woman. - Come, she wanted the services to be brief and simple. Poor Henrietta. - Yes, I'm wondering how long it'll take to probate the will too. - Really, Margaret, how can you say such things? - Well, it's true. The sooner the lawyers settle the estate, the sooner we can get out of this barn. Gives me the creeps. - My dear man, you will have to trust me, that's all. I assure you, you'll have every cent before the week is out. The only reason I've delayed so far is because a certain business deal's been hanging far, so to speak. But now it's all settled, and, yes, yes, you have my word. You know, I've been thinking... Abigail, with your keen ears, you ought to be able to hear there's someone at the front door. I don't we see why we tolerate that woman any longer. - Hello, Abby, how you feelin'? I been worried about you. - My health is perfect. - Nevertheless, I still been worried about you. Look, I can't get it out of my mind that somebody tried to poison Henrietta. Why don't you move into that apartment in town I told her about and I'll sell this place for you? You'd be a lot safer there. - Are you implying that Henrietta was murdered? - If she hadn't cremated the cat, I could prove it. - Ah, good morning, folks, good morning. - Mr. Penny. - Has he been here all night? - Search me. - Hey Penny. - What? - You been here all night? - Oh yes, I was all over the place. I spent the night in there, had a lovely night's sleep, had a nice shower this morning, had my breakfast. There's no more eggs, I ate the last two. Sometime. - What have you done to that footstool? - I'll take care of that now. It's good as new in just a minute. Let me see here. Oh, woohoo, look at that. Don't mind, don't worry about that, a litttle iodide'll take care, a little iodide. I'm always botching myself on the finger with... Oh! - Oh, I beg your pardon, just a moment, I'll take care of that, just a minute. A little cleaning fluid, that's all you need, take it out just like magic. Can't get it open. Got my pliers here, that'll open it up in a second. Oh, they're stuck too. Mm-hmm, have to get a little get a little oil. - All right then, call her in. - Let's get it over with. - Just leave it to me. - No oil, hmm. This is clogged up a little bit. Well, this wire'll take care of it. - Abigail. Will you come in here a moment, please? - If you know what's good for you, you'll get this mess cleaned up but quick. - Oh, Abigail, Elaine has decided to sell the house. Therefore your services will no longer be needed. It's her wish that you pack and leave immediately. - Elaine can speak for herself. - I'll see that you're well provided for, Abigail. - Thank you, I'll remember that. But I won't be needing your charity, Elaine. I'm the one who's giving the orders now. Well, of all the impertinence. - See, Henrietta told me just before her accident that... - Why don't you mind your own business and get outta here? - Relax Junior, you remember me, I'm the guy with the client that wants to buy this place. - Richard, please. - Elaine can't dispose of this house. None of you can. I have the say now. - Abby, let's you and I talk business. Now listen, I got a cashier's check for $25,000 - right in here... - Go away. Do you recognize this, Mr. Hartley? - Uh-uh-uh, don't touch, dynamite. - That's Henrietta's will. Give it to me at once. - No, I'll read it, and I'll begin where Henrietta left off. "However, considering the comfort and companionship" "given me by my cats, none of the preceding bequests" "shall apply so long as my faithful housekeeper," "Abigail Doone, lives, provided that she accepts" "the guardianship of the estate" "and administers it for the benefit" "of the aforementioned cats." - Of course, Henrietta was out of her mind, yeah, sure. Maliciously insane. What are we going to do about it? Nothing. Of course we'll do something. We'll get a lawyer. - If Grandmother could only see us now. She wouldn't be the least surprised. She knew what a rotten lot we were. Abigail and the cats deserve Grandmother's inheritance a lot more than we do. - A pretty speech, Elaine, but if it was meant to form a bond between us, it failed. I have only this to say. - Oh, you mean before you and I get to talking business. Go away. - Pack and leave, the lot of you. - We'll do nothing of the kind. We'll relinquish none of our rights. Henrietta was insane. We'll take the necessary steps to have her will set aside. - I'm for that. - It shouldn't be very difficult. - If you think it best, Monty. - I do. I'll leave for town at once and consult my attorneys. - Why don't you telephone them, Mr. Hartley? - The rest of you remain here, and remember, possession is nine points of the law. - You'll leave, all of you. You'll go. You'll see. Now what have you done? - I was just trying to light that lamp over there, so I guess I must've bumped into this table. - An what is the meaning of all this? - As soon as I light the heater, I'll melt the solder, fix this electric plug, and start this drill to fix these wire cutters so I can cut the wire to clean the spout to get some oil to work the pliers to unscrew the cap and clean the spot. Then I'll put some iodine on this finger and go back to work. - Suppose you start by lighting the heater. - Well you can't do that, you can't do that. - Why not? Hasn't got any wick in it. - Pick up these pieces carefully, and don't touch another thing in this house. - Oh, you want me to put it together? - Can you? - Oh yes, I got the glue right here. Get out of this house! - Hmm, catalog Winslow antiques and collector's items. Ooh, very good, just what I'm looking for. Very interesting, very interesting. Hmm, 18th century, 18th century. The lower hall, huh, yeah. Mm-hmm, long bookcase. - Abigail. Just caught the attitude of those people in there. You know what they're gonna do, they're gonna sick lawyers on you. Lawyers. Miss Abigail, do you know what lawyers mean? It means legal difficulties, months and months, maybe years and years. Goode? Miss Goode. - Doone. Miss Doone, where are you gonna get the money to fight this? Look, I'll tell ya what you do. Okay. You tell me what to do. - Mind your own business. Stop trying to frighten me into selling this place. - All right. I'll stick to my knitting, but you better take up embroidery, the needles are shorter. Penny! - Darling, I had to see you before you left. We're taking an awful chance being seen out here, you know. - Oh hello. Looks like it might rain, huh? - Is that what they've been talking about? - Who, them? No. You don't think I was listening, do ya? - Why, of course not. You know, I don't understand the sudden interest you've taken in our affairs. What do you mean by telling Abigail she should take up embroidery? - You've listened behind a couple of doors yourself, haven't you? Or did you hear that one on the radio? - I was coming down the stairs. I got it from a very loud speaker. - Thanks a lot. - Wait a minute. Were you insinuating that Grandmother's death wasn't accidental? - Well, she wasn't killed by kindness, was she? - I don't think that was a very nice thing to say. Why don't you join a sewing circle and take your antique friend Mr. Penny with you. - Hey, that reminds me. Just before you got here, Penny disappeared. - Well, get him to show you the trick. - Oh, that's very subtle, but I get it. But don't say I didn't warn you. - Now darling, you're jumping to conclusions. I didn't say that I wouldn't divorce Myrna, did I? This just isn't the time. - You mean after you get her money, you'll go after mine? - I knew I'd find you here with her. - Why Richard. - Don't act so innocent. I've been watching you two for a long time. What are you trying to do, break Myrna's heart? - You little fool. One might think that Myrna were your mother and I'd be your stepfather. - That's exactly how I feel about it. You divorced my own mother because you wanted Myrna's money. Now that that's gone, you wanna get rid of her and marry Margaret. - Richard. - I'm warning you. Break this off. - Warning me? - Or I may tell the coroner that remark you maid to Myrna, that we'd all be better off if Grandmother were dead. - Richard, you don't know what you're saying. - Oh, leave me alone! - The furniture, where's the furniture? Woohoo. Woohoo, termites, termites, oh, you little antique makers. What became of the kids, where are the kids? They'd blame everything on you, shh. Hello, hello? Come in. I am in, I am. Abigail. - Shh. - Quickly. I heard a scream, from in there. - Come on. - Mr. Penny. - Yeah? - What are you doing with that coffin? - That's not a coffin, it's a... - Yeah, what's that body doing in it? Woohoo! - I'd better stop Montague before he leaves. - Gil. Gil, her eyes are opening. Mr. Penny, come here. - Here. No, no, no, take her feet. - Oh, please, make up your mind. Hands, her feet. - What happened, Abigail? - I was getting something out of the chest. The lid must've fallen. Struck my head. - Yeah, put a beautiful crack in the wood, too. Made that chest twice as valuable. - I thought it old you... - Now Abigail, don't excite yourself. - Abby, you sure nobody tried to hit you with that lid? - So now you're trying to accuse one of us of murdering Abigail too. - We know the lid coulda hit her, but it couldn't put her in the chest, could it? - Really Gil. - I know that nobody cares what I think around this house, but in the future I advise Abigail to lock her door before she turns her back on it. - My door was locked. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Wait a minute now. Let's start countin' cards around here. Myrna said she heard a scream. We didn't. You said you had your door locked. We found it unlocked. Now, that's two jokers in a deck. Hey, Mr. Penny, how'd you get in this room? - Through there. - Where? - Over there. - I'm in here, aren't I? - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - We'll leave that card out completely now. Where was the black cat at the time of your accident? - I haven't seen that cat since Henrietta died. - It was in the chest with you. - That cat hasn't been following me, has it?! - Yeah. Abigail, lay down. I warned that this was gonna happen. Some people would, have lunch with me sometime. Don't drink any milk. Penny. - Penny! - What? - Penny, come on. Get outta here before you disappear into the woodwork again, would you? - What woodwork? I didn't... - Come on, come on. - Worked all right over there. - I know, I know. - Penny. - Huh? - I know you didn't wanna crack in front of Abigail, but confidentially, how'd you get in that room. - Confidentially? - Uh-huh. - I don't know. I was so wrapped up in my work I got wrapped up in myself. Next time I'll wrap something around my finger, then I'll know where I am. - Yeah, you're a great help. Thank you very much. - Hello? I don't get an answer. - Maybe you don't ask direct questions. Let me try. - You're dialing the police. - Who are you calling, the marines? - The doctor, Abigail's lost her mind. - Yeah, she almost lost her life, that's why I'm calling the cops. - So you still insist on making one of us a murderer. - Now Elaine, I... - Oh. - Cool it, Barbie, just another one of those accidents. - What happened? - We got a bad connection here. - Now who would want to do a thing like that? - I haven't got the faintest idea. Why don't you call the cops and find out? - Why certainly, yes. I fail to see the humor in this situation. - Oh, I wouldn't either if I were you, having to go out in the rain and taking a chance - on getting... - I'm not going out. - How we gonna get the cops if you don't? - Oh. Now wait a minute. Why don't you go? - Now there is a test of a man's sincerity. You're in trouble and how does he react? - Yes, yes, I'm very disappointed in Stanley. - I don't blame you. - I only hope you won't let me down as badly. - Me? - I thought I could always count on you. - Do you mean I got a chance? You been kinda kicking me around, you know. - I'm not kicking you around, I just don't like you maligning my family. - You say worse things about 'em than I do. - That's different, they're my relatives. But Gil, you're accusing one of us of murder. - Oh, he is, is he? - Go away. - Stanley, please. I guess I have been pretty mean to you at that, Gil. I'm sorry. But will you go? - Will I go. Not only will I bring back the cops, but I'll bring a doctor, a lawyer, violets, the morning paper... I been thinkin' this whole thing over, and you know, if anything happened to you while I was gone, I'd never forgive myself. I better stay. - We can manage without you, you know. - I'll settle this controversy right now. Gil, go out to the stables and send Eduardo. - Oh, now you're talking sense. - Why don't you go? - That's what I been trying to tell 'em at the house. Put this on. Go on, come on. They said there's only one man we can trust, that's Eduardo. Eduardo must go, that's what they said, Eduardo must go. - I'll go. - Mother, there's something I must tell you. - Yes dear? - Bet you can't guess who made this cabinet. - No, but I'm afraid we're going to find out. - The Hoboken Furniture Company, a very good imitation. But they couldn't fool me, I'm an old master. What did you say? - Shh. - You were going to tell me something, darling? - Nevermind, I'll tell you later. - Elaine, there's something I've got to explain to you, I... - Beautiful legs, beautiful. Hand-carved, too. - What were you saying, Stanley? - Hmm, you oughta play pinochle. - Why? - Pinochle players live forever. Crap shooters go like that. I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it. Oh, oh. - I got it! - I'm an innocent man, I didn't do it. Gil, what on Earth are you doing? - I've got it all figured out. Whoever tried to knock off Abigail got in through a secret passage. All right, go ahead and laugh, but that's the only explanation. They thought she was dead, they were trying to hide her body in the chest, and somebody scared 'em away and they went out and left the door unlocked. - Where were you and this Penny friend of yours while all this was going on? - What? - This house is no asset to you with Abigail alive, you know. - Gil was with me the whole time. I do wish you people would stop trying to make a murder out of this. Abigail was injured, she did it herself. - Yes, after cutting the telephone wires to make it look a little more dramatic. - Yeah? Well she certainly went to a lot of trouble just to give herself a headache. - I agree with Elaine. Abigail's just trying to get us out of the house. - You're very anxious to smooth this whole thing over. Maybe Gil is right about those secret passages. Your father rebuilt this house. You must've seen the plans when you took over his business. - I wouldn't try to accuse me if I were you. I happen to know that someone tried to poison Grandmother. And with your knowledge of chemistry... - Stop it, both of you. - Oh, why didn't you let him finish? - Shame on you. And you, Richard. Poor Henrietta dead not 24 hours. - That must be Montague. - I wouldn't bet on it. He left just before Abigail got banged on the head. Or did he? Oh, it's probably Eduardo with the police. Monty. - What's all this about somebody trying to kill Abigail? - Where did you find out about that? - Eduardo told me. I picked him up just the other side of the O'Royal. He told me you'd sent him for the police. - Ridiculous, Abigail's just pretending somebody tried to kill her. - All I want is an unbiased opinion. Did you bring the cops? - No. Storm's washed the bridge out. Nobody can get out here any more tonight. Now are you gonna stop interfering or aren't you? - No I'm not! There's been one murder in this house and there's liable to be another one. There's something awful creepy going on... Stand back, everybody. Gil! Oh, my, look. Gil, are you hurt? - No, I'm all right. - Thank you very much, it was too dark over there to read the inscription, much better in here. - Mr. Penny. - "Better death than dishonor." - The excitement's been too much for you, my dear. After all, you're not as young as you used to be, you know. - No. I'm not, am I? Monty, don't go away. - Well... Still feeling shaky? - I'm all right. Tell me, what did the lawyers say? - Oh, they said we had a chance to break the will. But lawyers always talk like that. Personally I thought they were rather dubious. - You could've used some of Henrietta's money, couldn't you? What do you think? - I don't know. I can only guess. You never tell me anything now, Monty. You used to tell me everything, always, and I always tried to help. But nowadays, why, we seem to be making conversation, the way you do with strangers. - Well, you know how business has been on my mind. You wouldn't want me to burden you with my troubles, would you? - Yes I would. If they're business troubles, Monty. What do you mean? - Is it only business, Monty? - Myrna dear, if there's one thing I can't stand, it's unreasonable jealousy. That's all the faith you have in me, if our marriage has come down to this, then why in heaven... - No, no Monty, don't say it. I'm overwrought, I know I am. I shouldn't have said it. I'll go to bed now, and in the morning, I'll feel differently. - Yes, but Myrna... - I'm sure I will. Good night, darling. - Good night. - There. It's a good thing Mr. Penny had some iodine. - It was tougher than I thought it was. - Well, let that be a lesson to you. Stop chasing nonexistent ghosts and murderers. - Maybe you're right about that, but I can't get the feeling out of my mind that there's something rotten in the house of Winslow. Something lurking, sneaking, just waiting to strike. Oh, oh! It got me. - Did you speak, did you speak? - What are you doing? - Oh, I'm just testing, testing this wood. It's rotten, rotten to the core, but it's priceless. - Of course it's priceless. It's not for sale yet. If you don't stop bothering Abigail, you're gonna get us both thrown outta here. Abigail, gives me an idea. Penny, come here. You stand here now, will ya? - Are we playing a game? - No, we're not gonna play a game. I'm gonna prove to you that this whole thing makes sense if you include secret passages. Now Penny, you're Abigail, get it? Abigail. - Yeah, yeah. - And this table right here, this is your chest. - I see. - Now, I'm in a secret passage. Now I come sneaking up. Hey Penny, go over to the chest, will ya? Hey Penny! - I'm Abigail. - All right, Abigail, go over to the table, huh? What table? - That table! - That's not a table, that's my chest. - Will you stop complicating things and do as you're told? Here, now stand here. Bend over. - Bend over, like Mr. Penny or Abigail? - I don't care, just bend. - Just an ordinary bend. - Just an ordinary bend, yeah. Now. Now I'm sneaking up. - Oh, I hear your shoes squeak, woohoo. - Suppose my shoes didn't squeak, suppose I was in my stocking feet. - Your stocking feet? Oho, then you'd get pneumonia and start coughing again. - This isn't a cold, I'm allergic to cats! - Oh, yeah, then you'll get cattalk, get it, cattalk, cattalk? Very good, very funny. Oh Gil, give it up. - All right, laugh. But if you wake up in the morning with your throat cut, don't say I didn't warn ya! - Go away cat, go away. Go away, cat. Oho, what a funny place to sleep. - Where'd he go? - Where'd who go? - I don't know, that's why I'm asking you. - Why don't you ask him? - Who? - The fella that passed me on the stairway. - Who was he, who was he? - Oh him? Oh, I don't know, such curiosity. Curiosity killed the cat, you know, and that's terrible. - Then you know... - Stop. Elaine? Stop! Wait a minute, you. Eduardo. What a have you done with Elaine? - I haven't seen her. - Yeah, well I'll look for myself. - Please, please, don't, don't open it! - Go away! - I wanted to take them to the barn, and now they're all out in the rain again. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Why don't you keep your nose out of our people's business? - Yeah, why don't I? Here kitty, kitty. Here kitty, kitty, kitty! - Mr. Hartley, Mr. Hartley! Somebody, please, Mr. Hartley. Richard, Stanley! Mr. Hartley! Mr. Hartley! Mr. Hartley! - What's the matter? - What are you yabbing about? - What's going on here? - Now be calm, all of you, I want you to be calm, don't get excited... - What's happened? - Elaine has disappeared. - What? - Wait a minute, I'll explain it to ya. I thought she was in the wagon, but she wasn't, it was full of cats, and Eduardo hadn't... - Hadn't what? - Hadn't a thing to do with it. Elaine wasn't in her room. Eduardo was putting her in a wagon, but it wasn't Elaine, it was cats. And then in the crematory, I saw Abigail, but Abigail wasn't there. But the black cat was there, but it wasn't there, I... Does this make any sense? - No. - No. - No. But I saw it! - I've never heard such nonsense. I never left my room all night. - No wait, please, please. I admit I'm wrong about Abigail. But where is Elaine? Answer me that, where is Elaine? Here I am, Gil. I just went down to get a book. Couldn't sleep. - She couldn't sleep. - This isn't a part of your other stupid accusations. - Yes, two more brains and he'd be a half-wit. - I'm sorry you couldn't sleep. - Come on. Come in my room by the fire. You'll catch your death of cold. That's about the only thing I ever will catch around this house. - Sit down. Sit down and tell me what on Earth you've been doing. - I haven't got enough brains to come in out of the rain. I thought I saw something. What's the difference? - I know. You thought you saw me and you rushed to the rescue, just like Sir Lancelot used to rescue his Elaine. - All right, so I'm a sap. - Oh, but you're not a sap, you're very sweet, and a lady never thinks it a mistake when a knight errant does battle for her, even when he is wet behind the ears. - It's like I been saying. Somebody around this house is playing for keeps. Do you know that somebody slugged me again? - No. One of my relatives, probably, and with good reason. - Go ahead and laugh. Whatever's sneakin' in this house is sneakin' right now. - There he goes again. - This way, everybody, follow me, come on! This way, come on, come on! - What do you want now? - I heard you scream, now don't deny it, I heard you scream! - You heard the tea kettle. I was brewing some tea. Oh. - Gil, will you please stop trying to make nervous wrecks out of all of us? - I didn't... - Come on, come on, Junior. I'll take lemon in mine. - You want to have tea with me? - Yeah, thanks for your hospitality, thank you. - Sit down. - Here? Yeah? Woohoo, nice little place you got here, very nice. Nice little place. - You really want some tea? Yes. I like my tea strong, it makes me sleep better. - You'll sleep. - Oh, saccharine, keeps your weight down. How much do you weigh, may I ask? I take two lumps, I take two lumps. - One is equal to two. - Anxious little things, aren't they? Two would blow your head off. - Drink and you'll sleep. Don't you think this is a little too strong? It might keep me awake? - Drink. Woohoo! - Oh, Gil. - What's the matter? - Gil, look. - What? What's going on? Ashes. - But how, why? - I don't know, but nobody came in that door, I can tell you that. - Gil, I'm scared. - Oh, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, don't you worry about that. Oh, I'm not trembling, I'm just keyed up. Oh! - What's the matter? - There's been someone in my room. There are ashes, and locks of a cat on my bed. Somebody's been in my room. - Looks like Abigail's work. I told you I saw her in the crematory. - Just another trick to scare us out of the house. - Well, I say we should have it out with her, once and for all. This is ridiculous. - Yeah, come on. Abigail. Stand back, everybody. Oh, we're too late, she's dead. - Poor Abigail. - Oh, Monty. - Now darling, pull yourself together. We'll get to the bottom of this. Ladies, go to your rooms, please, and lock your doors. - What's this? - Ashes. That proves it. It was Abigail, unquestionably. - He thinks he's Sherlock Holmes. - But how could Abigail... - That's what I been trying to tell ya. Secret passages. Looks like they backfired on the old girl, too. - Isn't it possible she committed suicide? - It certainly looks like suicide to me. - I'm not so sure. - The coroner will settle that in the morning. Now ladies, go to your rooms, please. - Oh Monty, I don't want to be alone. All right, dear. Coming, Margaret? - Now I know it's murder. - Must be a junior G-man. - You don't have to be a detective to know that. Look at those splinters, they're from the door. You can tell by the angle they're stuck in the fiber that the body was pulled up over the door, and then the rope was tied to the knob. Had it been suicide, the rope would've been tied to the knob first, the weight of the body would've pulled the rope this way. - He's right. - Gil. - Better not tell the others, it'll only worry them. - Well I've got a gun. And if anything else happens tonight, I'm gonna use it. Yeah. - Don't make a move! - What are you doing in here? - I was chasing Eduardo, I wanted to make sure he didn't harm the women. - Now what are you hiding? It's Henrietta's will. Yeah, I found it there under the pillow. I was just trying to figure out how Myrna got it. - I gave that to Mother tonight. She bawled me out for it and said she was going to give it back to Abigail in the morning. - Oh, then you're the guy that slugged me. - Yeah, and I'll do it again any time you train down to my weight. - Mother! Get away! Get the rope off, hurry. Please. Carry her out. Be careful. - She's still alive. - Oh, thank heavens. Here. Get some smelling salts, quick! - I'll get some. - Here. Spritz ammonia. She's coming around. - Myrna. Myrna, who was it? Who was it tried to kill you? - I don't know. It's all so terribly confusing. Hands came from behind. They seized my throat. - Try to think, Mother. It was Eduardo, wasn't it? They've been chasing him all through the house. - Yes, it was. It was Eduardo. I was standing there... - I'll head him off! Be careful, he's insane. - Here Mother, don't hesitate to use this. Gil, where are you going? - To get Eduardo, he's the one that tried to kill Myrna! - Oh, but he didn't! Gil, listen to me! Stay with Myrna, she's got the gun. - Gil! - Look there! Come on, we'll head him off at the gate! Come on, quick! - Why did you tell them I tried to hurt you? - You did! - But that is a lie, I never hurt anybody! I never did anything wrong, but keep the black kitten. And now it's gone. I look the whole... - Did you hear that shot? - Yeah, where'd it come from? Richard! - Why did you do it? - He's a maniac. He killed Abigail, and he tried to kill me. - But Myrna, you tried to kill yourself. The splinters in the rope show that just as plainly as they showed that Abigail was murdered. - You're out of your mind. The second time in the last 15 minutes that he tried to kill me. - What did you do with that gun? - I gave it to Mother. - I was ready to blame Monty and Margaret for driving you to suicide. - What do you mean? - You knew about them. You knew your only chance to hold Monty was to get some ready money. That's why you killed Grandmother. And you knew about secret passages too, because you were here when the house was rebuilt. - What are you saying? - And when you found out about the added clause in the will, you sneaked through those secret passages to kill Abigail, and then you pretended to hang yourself, you stood on that footstool until somebody came into the room, and then you shot poor Eduardo, so as to blame everything on him! - Myrna! - Elaine! - Myrna! - Mother! - Elaine! - Myrna! What's happened? - Are you all right, Mother? - He came back through the window. - We should never have left you alone. Oh. - I owe all of you an apology, I've thought some pretty bad things about you. - Now, now, now. Just put it out of your mind. The district attorney should thank you for catching Abigail's murderer. - There's no need to worry now, Mother. The real danger's over. - Yes, I suppose so. - Try to get some sleep. - Good night, darling. - Good night, Mother. - Come along. - Monty, I'm still terribly upset. I'd rather be alone. - Of course. Myrna, I hope you haven't taken Stanley's insinuations about Margaret and me seriously. As a matter of fact, it was nothing more than a little discussion about finances. - Everything's going to be all right. The money I get from Henrietta's estate, it's going to take care of all your business worries. - What did you do? - He's in the library. - Good, we shouldn't have any more trouble. Good night. - Good night. - I'm sorry for everything. - You should be. - Elaine. Elaine. Coming. Did you knock? Oh, so you found it, huh? - Found what? - Hey, have you seen Elaine? - Elaine, who's Elaine? The girl with the pretty eyes you're always looking at? - Yeah. - No. - Do you know where these passages lead to? Where, where? - Well you gotta guess, you gotta guess. - To the attic. - No, you're freezing cold. - The cellar. - You're getting a little warmer, a little warmer. - Where? - No no no, not down by the stable, but you're getting hot, very hot. In fact, you're burning. - This is no time for games. Where do the passages lead to? - Remember before when I told you I'd give you a hint if you're getting warm? Well, you give up now? - Yes, I give up! - It leads down to the crematory. Two turns to the right and one to the left. - Two right and one left. - Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith, come here. - Yeah, what? - I don't wanna start any false rumors, but some very strange things been happening around here, very weird. - No. - Yes. - Elaine! Elaine! Elaine! Elaine! - Oh! You frightened me. - This secret passageway, it leads right to the house. - So you were right about them after all. How clever of you. - Yeah. Hey. What are you doing here, if you don't mind my asking? - I couldn't sleep. I decided to come down and commune with poor Henrietta. It's so peaceful down here. - Yeah? Haven't seen Elaine, have you? - Elaine is materialist. You could hardly expect to find her in a place like this. - I'm sorry I disturbed you. What was that? - Just a cat. There's always a cat some place around here. - Yeah. Stopped raining. - I'm glad. - If you didn't know about those secret passages, how'd you get in here without getting wet? - Pitcher and a vase. - One pitcher and a vase. - Oh, that's terrible, that's terrible. - Gee boss, I'm sorry. - You oughta be sorry. That's no way to handle furniture. Here. That's the way to drop a chair. You put that together, you got a beautiful antique. Take it away. Oh, there you are. I have to give you a check here for the furniture. - Hey Mr. Penny, listen. The new owner is coming to look the place over today. Don't tell him about the murders. - No, about what? - About the murders! - The murders? What murders? - Nevermind, just write the check, huh? - Murders. Well you should be very happy, Gil. You finally closed the big one. I am. - Forgive me, Gil. - Sure. I'd forgive you for anything. - I make this out, woohoo, I get it, I get it. There you are, Mr. Smith. I think we've both made a good deal. Oh! How did he get in this picture? Woohoo!
