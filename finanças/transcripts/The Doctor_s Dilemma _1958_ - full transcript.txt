Subtitles by Nostromo Harley Street,the home of the medical profession. Here they all are: The good and the bad. And the surgeons are the worst. They found out that the man's body is full of bits and scraps of old organs there is no use for You can cut out half a dozen of them out, without leaving him any the worse Except for the illness and the guineas it costs him I know him. He used to snip off the ends of people's uvulas for 50 guineas. And that fellow too He extirpated tonsils for two hundred guineas until he took up women's cases at double the fees Cutler Walpole,he got hold of something he called the nuciform sac which he's made quite the fashion You could pay him 500 guineas to cut it out. And might as well get their hair cut,for all the difference it makes. Hello? Reporters already Of course Famous doctor receives knighthood: Sir Colenso Ridgeon. Well,well I am with 'The Globe'. I wonder if Mr Colenso.. No he can't Oh, Sir Patrick,you'd better come in Good Morning - Could we possibly see... - No you couldn't I wanted to be the first to congratulate him I was never so taken aback I always thought his great discoveries was fudge let alone the mess of them with his drops of this and that and tubes full of fever -All in the interest of science,Emmy -I don't take much of science I've lived with it too long I'll tell him you are there. Have you finished your two eggs,sonny? Oh,yes That’s my ducky diamond! Now keep yourself tidy and don’t go messing about and dirtying your hands The people are coming to congratulate you. You can come in,Sir Patrick Well,young fellow,is your hat too small for you,eh? Much too small,and I owe it all to you. Blarney,my boy,thank you all the same I live in a state of siege ever since they got that about that I am a magician who can cure consumption with a drop of serum Modern science is a very interesting thing,Colly Look at your great discovery,look at all the great discoveries. What are they all leading to? Why, right back to my poor dear old father's ideas and discoveries. And he's been dead now over 40 years. It's very interesting. There is nothing like progress. So you found out how to cure consumption,Colly? I believe so Well,I've known over 30 men who found out how to cure consumption Why do people go on dying of it,Colly? Devilment, I suppose Don't move. Jinny,don't move I should rest now,you can come down. I've had enough of this I said that before Look at those bills. I'd have other people do it before You don't think that I must have the money now. I'll promise you tomorrow you'll be paid everything,I promise -All right -Thank you He wanted to be paid,I suppose? They are refusing to deliver it anymore unless we pay. Damn those fellows. They can give nothing and care for nothing but their wretched money. Money, money, money,money So sordid I loathe money Don't be unhappy,love I can easily earn enough and more back Next year I'll have my own exhibition. You don't believe a bit of my discovery, you old cynic I don't go as far as that,Colly Have a look at my pamphlet Redpenny. Yes,Sir You're late as usual I was held up at the hospital for the night report Oh,(?)what I want for a drink. You go up to the drawing room and help your self,I'll join you in a minute. As a matter of fact I like a word with you alone Opsonin? What's the devil is opsonin? Opsonin is what you butter the disease germs with so that the white corpuscle will eat them. But you must understand the treatment Inoculate at the right moment and cure Inoculate at the wrong moment can kill. That's my discovery. The greatest since Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood I need a drink. -Old Paddy Cullen can still knock it back -Indeed And who taught you to call Sir Patrick Cullen,Old Paddy Cullen? You never call him anything else You fellows will be calling me old Colly Ridgeon next. Ah,we do it at St. Anne's. That's what makes the medical students the most disgusting figure in modern civilization. No veneration, no manners. -Do you think Sir Colenso Ridgeon could.. -No,I don't -Well -May I see Sir Colenso? I don't have an appointment and I know what a busy date it must be for him But I come on a very urgent matter. Do you think you could arrange it for me? I'd like your advice. Professional advice? Oh yes There is something that matters with me. Oh,there's nothing wrong with my organs. It's just I feel unsettled, as if something is going to happen And it's another symptom scraps of tunes keep on going through my head Which seem to me to be quite pretty which are in fact quite commonplace. -Do you hear voices? -No I'm glad for that. When my patients tell me they made a greater discovery than Harvey and they hear voices, I'll lock them up. -Do you think I'm mad? -You're sure there are no voices? Oh quite sure Then it's only foolishness. Very common between the age of 17 and 22. Sometimes comes on at 40 year,there about You are a bachelor, you see,makes it not serious if you are careful. -How about my food? -No, about your behavior. You are not going to die, but you may be making a fool of yourself. So be careful. -Dear lady wants her husband's lungs cured -I told you I'll see nobody Then I'll tell her to wait. You'll tell her I'll not see her, and send her away,do you hear? Well,will you see Mr.Cutler Walpole? He don't ask to be cured He only wants to congratulate you - Yes, I'll see him - You can come in. Mr Cutler Walpole My dear Richard,best wishes,the heartiest congratulations you deserve them. Thanks As a man of course,as a man You deserve it as a man,this discovery of yours is of course,is all nonsense. Opsonin? Absolute rot,as any capable surgeon will tell you That we're all delighted delighted to see your personal qualities officially recognized -Sir Patrick,how are you? -Well I've sent you a paper lately about a little thing I invented A new saw for shoulder blades. Yes,I got it needs a good saw. Very useful and handy useful. I knew you'll see it's points. -I remember that saw 65 years ago. -What? It was called a cabinet maker's jimmy then. -Get out,nonsense, a cabinet maker's -No never mind him, he's only jealous. Sir Colenso,Sir I say I hope I'm not interrupting you two in anything private? Oh,no,no,I was only consulting about I'm a little out of sorts Overwork I suppose I know what's the matter with you I see it in your complexion. I felt it in the grip of your hand - What? - Blood poisoning. Blood poisoning,impossible Blood poisoning 95 percent of the human race suffer from chronic blood poisoning. And die of it It's simple as ABC. Your nuciform sac. What's wrong with my nuciform sac? It is full of decaying matter Ridgeon,take my advice Let me cut it out for you. You'll be another man afterwards Don't you like him as he is? No, I do not like,I don't like any man who hasn't got a healthy circulation. I tell you this in an intelligent governed country people wouldn't be allowed to go about with their nuciform sacs The operation ought to be compulsory Have you had your own sacs removed,may I ask? I haven't got one Well look at me. I have no symptoms, I'm as sound as a bell. About five percent,five percent of the population don't seem to have any sac at all Well,luckily I just happen to be one of the five percent. That I've only come across one another case like me Mrs Jack Foljambe The smart Mrs Foljambe Somehow I made this up but she would have a new norm And I told her so And in the true hygienic spirit she insisted She absolutely insisted that I should operate on her You know,she hadn't any sac at all. No a trace, not a rudiment. I was so upset... that I forgot to take the sponges out As I was stitching her up. One of the nurses... Sir Ralph Bloomfield Bonington. Where is he? Drat him, I thought he was following me. He's stayed down to talk to that lady - I told you to tell that lady - Here he is. Sir Colenso,Sir Colenso welcome to the order of knight hood Thank you, B. B. Sir Patrick you here? How are we today? A little chilly a little stiff? But still hale and still the cleverest of us all -Old Walpole, the absent minded beggar,eh? -Now what does that mean? Have you forgotten that lovely opera singer I sent you? They had a growth diagnosed at the vocal cords Great heavens man you didn't sent her for a throat operation? Ha,you removed her nuciform sac Force of habit,my dear fellow,force of habit. Never mind,she got her voice back afterward She thinks you are the greatest surgeon in the world, so you are,so you are Blood poisoning. And a house of a certain distinguished family getting on under your care,Sir Richard? Ridgeon here will be glad to hear I used his opsonin treatment on the little Prince Henry with complete success -But how? -I suspected blood poisoning. So I called in at St Anne's one morning for a tube of your very excellent serum You were out unfortunately Well,I hope they explained very carefully Good heavens,I didn't need any explanation I left my wife waiting in a carriage at the door and I'd no time to be taught my business by your young fellows No,no besides I know all about antitoxins But they are not antitoxins They are very dangerous, if they are not used at the right time Well of course they are everything is dangerous unless it is used at the right time. An apple in the morning does you good An apple at bedtime upsets you for a week There is only two rules for any toxin first,never be afraid of them second inject them a quarter of an hour before meals three times a day - Great heavens,B.B no,no - But Colly,yes,yes It was a great success worked like magic on little prince Henry. The family was so nice but their gratitude was quite touching I explained,they owed it all to you and I am glad to think your knighthood is the result I am deeply obliged. Yes? -I am Dr. Blenkinsop. -Thank you doctor,come in That's why I'm taking up your treatment, Colly,pushing it,it's scientific Will you see a Dr. Blenkinsop ? Oh,Blenkinsop,yes of course. I've just come to offer my humble congratulations. Blenkinsop,how are you ? -All the great guns I have before me -How are you Blenkinsop? How are you? And Sir Patrick too. -Do you know Walpole? -No,it's the first time I've had that honor How do you do In my poor little practice there are no chances of meeting you great men I know only these St Anne's men on my own days And so you are Sir Colenso now. How does that it feel? Rather foolish first.Don't take any notice of it I'm afraid I haven't a notion of what your great discovery is but I congratulate you just the same for the sake of old times My dear Blenkinsop you used to be so keen on science Ah,I used to be a lot of things,look at me now What can I do? I have never opened a book since I qualified. They are so expensive one But I have experience clinical experience,and bedside experience is the main thing isn't it? Nonsense. All you better see is the outside of the patient, It's not the outside that is wrong What you need is the daily familiarity of people's inside And that you could only get with the knife. Ah,that's all very well for you gentlemen to talk but because you haven't had my practice Except for the workmen my patients are all clerks and shop-men They dare not be ill.They can't afford it And the worst of it is I'm too poor to keep well myself on this sort of cooking I have to put up with How am I to inspire confidence? No,Blenkinsop I can't bear it The most tragic thing in the world is a sick doctor. Like a bald headed man trying to sell a hair restorer Yeah Thank God I'm a surgeon Of course I am never sick Never had a day's illness in my life. This what enables me to sympathize with my patients. -What! You're never sick? -No,no,never That's very interesting.You know, I believe you have no nuciform sac I say B.B.,if you ever do feel at all queer I wish you let me open you up and I just have a little look It's kind of you but I'm rather busy just at the moment It may sound ridiculous to you great men but what I always recommend to my patients is a pound of right greengages everyday half an hour before lunch. I'm sure they'll find a benefit They are very cheap Very sensible,I'm so glad to hear Blenkinsop. You disapprove of drugs Drugs are a delusion Look at the newspapers full of the most scandalous advertisements for patent medicines. A vast commercial system of quackery and poison. Who is responsible? We are We talk to people to believe in bottles of doctors stuff Now they buy it themselves, instead of calling a medical man The really remedy for all diseases is Nature's remedies Nature has provided in the white corpuscles in the phagocytes as we call them a certain method of devouring and destroying all disease germs There is at bottom only one scientific treatment for all diseases and that is to stimulate the phagocytes,stimulate the phagocytes Mr Walpole Your motorcar has come here and it's frightening Sir Patrick's horses So come along quick Oh dear in that case I'd better go. Well Good Bye Ridgeon Delighted to have met you,Blenkinsop Walpole you get my point? No. The phagocytes are pure rot all cases are blood-poisoning and the only real remedy is the knife Walpole has no intellect, a mere surgeon. Wonderful operator but after all what is operating The nuciform sac,of course, is utter nonsense. Still I'm glad for Walpole's sake that the operation is so fashionable. Now,Colly, you mustn't fret about your health. If you're restless,try a little sedative. If that doesn't answer little mercury never did any users any harm If you can't sleep: Trional,trional,trional But no drugs,Colly, remember that. No, no quite right as a temporary experience but not as a treatment,Good bye Blenkinsop,Good Bye There is only one scientific treatment for all diseases and that is to stimulate the phagocytes. -BTW who is the patient?- Who? -Charming woman,tuberculous husband Is she there still? Come on, Sir Ralph,your wife's waiting in the carriage. You tell that woman once and for all She is not in a hurry,she doesn't mind how long she waits. I must be off too. Every half hour I spend away from my work costs me 18 pence. -Come to lunch one day. -I can't afford it,dear boy besides it would put me off my own food for a week. Thank you for all the same Poor fellow Well,we can't be all geniuses like you. And for all you know Bloomfield Bonington kills less people than you do Very likely but he really ought to know the difference between a vaccine and an antitoxin Stimulate the phagocytes. To put a tube of serum in his hands is murder Simple murder Now, Sir Patrick. It's time for Colly to get to his work Whats that to you, you old catamaran? Come, come, now!None of your temper to me Behave yourself,Emmy Oh,I've learn how to behave myself before I learn you to do it Come along now,come along -Goodbye Colly -Good Bye,Paddy,thank you for coming You are an ugly old devil, and no mistake. You're no beauty yourself Manners. Here now, are you going to see that poor thing or are you not? Come now,just see her for a minute to please me,there’s a good boy She's given me half a crown. She thinks it's life and death to her husband for her to see you. Values her husband's life at half-a-crown! Well, it's all she can afford, poor lamb Besides, she'll put you in a good temper for the day, And she's the sort that gets round you Oh, send her up and be hanged. -Redpenny -Yes,Sir There's a patient come to see me. If she hasn't gone in a few moments come in with an urgent message from the hospital for me You understand,she's to have a strong hint to go. I have Mrs Dubedat. Doctor Wait.Before we begin, let me tell you at once, there is nothing I can do for you I sent you that answer by my servant, you wouldn't take that answer How could I? -You bribed her. -I did That doesn’t matter. She coaxed me to see you Well, you must take it from me now that with all the good will in the world, I cannot undertake another case. Doctor,you must save my husband.You must When I explain to you, you will see that you must It is not an ordinary case. Not like any other case He is not like anybody else in the world believe me,he is not, I can prove it to you. And you can save him, the papers say you can - What is the matter with him? - His left lung. Ah,yes,you needn't tell me about that. You can cure him, if only you will It is true that you can, isn't it? Oh, tell me, please tell me Now you are going to be very quiet And self-possessed I beg you pardon, I know I should Oh, please, say that you can, and then I shall be all right. I am not a cure monger,if you want cures, you must go to the people who sell them. But I have ten patients who I believe I can save -Oh thank you -Wait a minute Try and think of those ten patients as ten shipwrecked men on a raft that will not support one more Suddenly,another head bobs up through the waves and begs to be taken aboard He implores the captain to save him But the captain can only do this by pushing off one of his ten men and drowning him in order to take the new comer on That is what you're asking me to do Can you give me the name of another doctor who understands your secret? Every man in this street is a doctor But apart from myself and a handful of men I am training at St Anne's No one has mastered the opsonin treatment And we are full. I am sorry But that's all I have to say Good Morning Doctor Look at these,you understand drawings, you had good ones in your waiting room. - Look at them. - It's no use my looking This is the real thing. It's very clever It's unfinished ,isn't it? He gets tired so soon,but you see, don't you, what a genius he is. You see that he is worth saving That's you,isn't it? Yes,it was the first one he ever did It's a wonderful drawing. -What a fascinating dress. -Yes,he liked me in it very much Why is it called Guinevere? My name is Guinevere It's only what you call Jennifer I think Jennifer Jennifer May I ask is it for sale? I'll like to buy it. Take it,doctor,it's my own,he gave it to me take it,take them all, ask anything but save him,doctor Sir,they've just telephoned from the hospital that you’re to come instantly A patient on the point of death the carriage is waiting. Oh,nonsense,get out what do you mean by interrupting me like this Can't you see I'm engaged,be off Doctor Doctor -Doctor,one instant only before you go -Sit down, it's nothing. But the patient,he said he was dying He's probably dead by now. Don't mind sit down Oh, but if you care. You see people die every day. Nonsense,I told him to come and say that. I thought I should want to get rid of you Don’t look so bewildered, nobody is dying. My husband is. Oh yes, I forgot about your husband Mrs Dubedat,you're asking me to do a very serious thing. I am only asking you to save the life of a great man You are asking me to kill another man for his sake For if I take a new case I shall have to return one of the old ones for the ordinary treatment Well, I will not shrink from that I had to do it before, and I will do it again If you can convince me that his life is more valuable than the worst life I am now trying to save But you must convince me first He made those drawings He is very young,doctor, his whole life is before him. Well, deary,have you got round him? I see you have -That’s a good boy -Hold your tongue And call me a hansom cab -Come inside. -Wait I have a better idea. I'm giving a dinner to some friends in Richmond to celebrate my knighthood. Perhaps you read about it lately Yes,it was how I found out about you It'll be a doctor's dinner and and it was to have been a bachelors' dinner. I am a bachelor If you were to entertain for me and bring your husband He will not only meet me He will meet some of the most eminent members of my profession I could put his case to them and he will have to stand or fall by what we think of him. Will you come? Oh yes,of course we will come, thank you,thank you You've made me so happy. I know you would admire and like him Oh,doctor Yes,what is it? I mean Your fees for the consultation. Shall we say a beautiful portrait of his favorite model. Entire treatment and cure? You are very generous Thank you -I know you will cure him. -I will cure him -Good bye -Good bye Oh, Louis I've got some wonderful news Louis Louis Oh Louis,how beautiful We can't afford that darling I have some wonderful news for you What? It has to be a marvelous dinner This? No,I said marvelous dinner I am glad for your dinner. My own taste is very simple,Mr Dubedat A mere crust of bread and I'm happy and contented Unfortunately I have to live and eat and drink in a manner expected by my patients from their medical attendant Yes,indeed I do know exactly what you mean I suppose it's the same for all professions Take an artist. People expect us to be intemperate, disheveled,dissolute. Indeed they are very angry when we are not. So we are Don't look so solemn, Jinny baby. Why do you let him spoil your beautiful name like that,Mrs Dubedat? You don't understand these things, Richard,you're a bachelor Look at me,I also have two names. In moment of domestic crisis I'm simple Ralph. But when the sun shines in the home I am Beedle Deedle Dumkins. Such is married life. Look at that light,see how they are sparkling things Exquisite thing. I wondered if you'd be kind enough to sign your name on the menu? -Cigarette BB? -No thank you -Under the sketch you made of me. -May I borrow it? Certainly Oh yes mine,mine too -If you'd be so good, -Thank you What do you think of Louis? Or am I wrong to ask? Wrong? We are all charmed of him. You shall go away happy. He is worth saving. He must and shall be saved. Certainly. How can I ever thank you? From this night on I can begin to be happy at last Oh,no, come,come dear lady Don't mind us have a good cry You mustn't cry. Mr Dubedat mustn't know we're talking about him. No,of course The motor is here ,Sir.And there is an urgent telephone call for Dr. Blenkinsop I'm so sorry we have to go.It's seems such a pity this beautiful night And we have enjoyed it so much. I'm sure another half an hour won't do him any harm No,no Colly,none of that.You take your man home,Mrs Dubedat and put him to bed. Quite right,bed before eleven, sorry to lose you,dear lady -Yes we,come -I'll get my coat and join you in the front Good night.I'm so happy to have met you Good night,Dubedat Never fear,never mind I shall cure that cough. Oh,thank you,thank you all so much Good night,Mrs Dubedat We shall stimulate the phagocytes. If the phagocytes fail come to me,I’ll put him right How glorious it must be to be a doctor Now wrap yourself up well. Don't think your lungs are made of iron because they're stronger than his Thank you for coming A charming woman,gifted man. Lucky Ridgeon I'm sorry to have left you like this, but there was a telephone message They found half a milkman at our level crossing with a prescription of mine in his pocket. -Where's Mrs Dubedat? -They are just going Going? Perhaps I can overtake them Very,very nice people I must confess I was afraid the husband would turn out an appalling bounder But he is almost as charming in his way as she is in hers. And there's no mistake his being a genius Well,it's something to have found a case really worth saving Do you say there's something wrong with Dubadet, Sir Patrick? What could be wrong with him? A charming young man What could be wrong with him? There are two things that can be wrong with any man. One is the cheque. The other is a woman Until you know a man's sound on those two points, you know nothing about him. He's all right as to the cheque for the time being at all events He talked to me quite frankly before dinner about the pressure of money difficulties in an artist Apparently he has no vices and is most economical So I just said, bang out why not let me lend you twenty pounds, and you can pay me when your ship comes home I must say he was very nice about it He took it like a man When was this? When I joined you that time on the terrace. Good heavens he had just borrowed 10 pounds from me. Well, it was hardly borrowing as he said himself heaven only knows when he could pay me back But I couldn't very well refuse,you see. It seems that Mrs Dubedat has taken a sort of fancy to me And? -No,it was to me -No,no your name was never mentioned He is still wrapped up in his work he has to leave her a good deal alone And the poor innocent young fellow Of course he has no idea of my position or how busy I am Actually suggested that I might like to call her occasionally and talk with her. It was exactly he said that to me Good heavens I say,Ridgeon,this begins to look serious. Hello,Blenkinsop,did you catch him? No,excuse me running away like that. - What's the matter? - It's nothing Trifle,something ridiculous Can't be helped,never mind Is it anything to do with Dubedat? I ought to keep it to myself It's too ridiculous Dubedat asked me to lend him half-a crown to tip the cloakroom He said he only wanted it for five minutes, as his wife had his purse So naturally I lent it to him He has forgotten to pay me back. I've just two pence to get back with Oh never mind about that No,no,look,I know what you are going to say but I won't take it now I've never borrowed a penny in my life and I never will If none of you could meet me without being afraid that my civility was leading up to the loan of five shillings there would be an end of everything for me I'll train it as far as the twopence will take me and I'll tramp the rest. Nonsense,you'll go the whole distance in my motor car Come along Thank you very much I beg you pardon,Sir Yes? I was wondering,Sir if you could give me the address of that gentleman who was with your dinner? You mean the young gentleman? Yes,Sir,the one who just left with that woman he brought with him Woman? You mean the lady who dined here, the gentleman's wife? You'd better not think so, she is not his wife, she can't be. I am his wife. My good girl! I could run upstairs and get you my marriage certificate say if you doubt my word. He's Mr Louis Dubedat, isn't he? Yes Well I think so,Sir Believe me or not, but I am the lawful Mrs. Dubedat And I wed three years ago last April. Why aren't you living with your husband? We couldn't afford it,Sir I had thirty pounds saved and we spent it all in three weeks And more than that he borrowed Then he went to London ,I never saw or heard of him again. On my soul I'm beginning to suspect our young friend maybe rather careless. Careless? He's a damned young blackguard That's severe,Sir Patrick,he's very young She is very pretty. Oh,please can't you tell me, where can I find him? Shall I give her the address? Give her your own address and then we'll see - What's your name? - Minnie,Sir. -Write to this address,and it'll be sent on -Thank you,Sir Thank you all gentlemen,excuse the liberty Do you realize we've promised Mrs Dubedat to save this fellow's life? -What's the matter with him? -Tuberculosis. - And you can cure that? - I believe so. No,no,no no use I know what you are going to say A fortnight holiday would save my life, I should have to die. I can't afford to look after myself and that's the end of it Don't let us talk about it Mr Walpole,I wonder if I might spunge on you for another of those nice cigarets? Of course,certainly Oh,no Yes,I remember now I passed Dubedat my cigaret case and he never returned it It was a gold one A wonderful night Exquisite scenery,stimulating conversation,a capital dinner My own tastes My own tastes Are very simple,Mrs Dubedat A mere crust of bread and I'm happy and contented Unfortunately I have to eat and drink in a manner which my patients expect of their medical attendant Dubedat will be saved.He'll paint better than ever before. His health will be restored He will have a one man exhibition which will make him rich and famous And I owe it all to you. Well, Mr Savior of Lives,which is it to be? That honest decent man Blenkinsop, or that rotten blackguard of an artist,eh? It's a difficult case to judge Blenkinsop is honest and decent man,but is there any use? Dubedat's a rotten blackguard but he's a genuine source of pretty and pleasant good things. What will he be a source of for that poor innocent wife of his when she finds him out? Yes,that's true. Her life will be a hell Still,it's a dilemma Yes it's a dilemma Ans there is a complication I haven't mentioned that What's that? Well, if I let Blenkinsop die at least no one will say I did it because I wanted to marry his widow I see If I let Dubedat die,I'll marry his widow. Perhaps, she won't have you, you know I've flair for that sort of thing. I can tell when a woman is interested in me. Well, sometimes a man knows best and sometimes he knows worst You'd much better save them both But I can't.I'm at my limit I might squeeze in one more case,but not two I must choose Well, you must choose as if she didn’t exist that's all She troubles my judgment To me, it's a plain choice between a man and a lot of pictures. It's easier to replace a dead man than a good picture Guinevere Guinevere It's a dilemma. Yes, it's a dilemma -Johnson,I'm taking on another case -Could I have his name ,Sir? I'll give you his name and particulars tomorrow. Repeat whit me. I promise... I promise Honestly and faithfully... Honestly and faithfully Never to.. -Never to -No,no. Never to Never to borrow any more money Until? Until I first ask you That's that Otherwise might get people the wrong impression of you If I was strong enough to work most of the day I'd make my darling's house a temple and a shrine more beautiful whatever imagined Louis Did you finish those drawings for McLean? That doesn't matter anymore.I got nearly all the money from him in advance That's why you should finish those He asked me the other day whether you really intended to finish them Confound his impudence! What the devil does he take me for? They have destroyed all my interest in the job I've a good mind to throw up the commission give his money back Louis,we can't afford that,dear Why not you finish the drawings and have done with them I think it is a mistake to accept money in advance Goodness,I didn't know it was so late the doctors will be here in any minute Oh,Louis,isn't it extraordinary kind of them to insist on coming all of them to consult about you Oh, I dare say they think it's a feather in their cap to cure a rising artist They wouldn't come if it didn't amuse them,anyhow. Ridgeon I'm delighted to see you You must forgive this place it's only a studio,you know. But we peg along somehow, thanks to Jennifer So good of you to come, Doctor. Please come in. Now I'll run along,if you forgive me And then perhaps later on, when you finish with Louis I may come in and hear the verdict -Or would you rather I didn’t? -Not at all,not at all Don't look so grave. There’s nothing awful going to happen, is it? No That's all right You know Jennifer has been looking forward to this visit of yours more than you can imagine She's taken quite a fancy to you, Ridgeon The poor girl has got no one to talk to I'm always painting This is for a picture I'm going to call 'Death and the maiden'.Rather fun What do you think of this? A sketch that I made of her yesterday. Yes,she showed me a fortnight ago when she first called on me Oh! did she? Good Lord How time does fly! I could have sworn I'd only just finished it. You know it's hard for her here, seeing me piling up drawings and nobody coming in to buy them Of course I shall sell them all next year at my one man exhibition But while the grass grows steed starves I hate to have her coming to me for money all the time,having none to give her But what can I do? What do you think of that? I've not come here to discuss your drawings I have got more urgent and pressing business with you. I know,you want to sound my wretched lung I'll be just quite frank with you,Ridgeon The trouble in this house isn't lungs but bills. It doesn’t matter about me But you know Jennifer Jennifer actually has to economize in the matter of food You've made us feel that we can treat you as a friend. Will you lend us a hundred and fifty pounds? No - Why not? - I am not a rich man. I need every penny I can spare and more for my researches You mean you want your money back again I presume people do sometimes have that in view when they lend money. I can manage that for you. I'll give you a cheque There's no reason why you shouldn't make a bit out of it too I'll give you a cheque for two hundred. Why not cash the cheque yourself without troubling me? Bless you! they wouldn't cash it I'm overdrawn as it is Indeed.You have to find some other means getting the money - You mean that you refuse? - Of course I refuse,man Once and for all, I will not lend you a farthing. I will be little glad to help your wife but lending money to you is of no service to her Oh well, if you're in earnest about helping her I'll tell you what you might do You might get your patients to buy some of my things or Or give me a few portrait commissioning My patients call me in as a physician, not as a commercial traveller Yes,but you have such a great authority with the money You must know such a lots of things about them Private things Things they wouldn't like to have known They wouldn't dare refuse you Well, upon my Walpole,Sir Patrick I've only been here a few moments and he tried to borrow 150 pounds of me And he was just interrupted in the act of suggesting that I should blackmail my patients into sitting to him for their portraits Ridgeon I spoke to you in confidence We are all going to speak to you in confidence,young man Don't be alarmed,Dubedat, you are a fascinating fellow and we all like you Well,all right,all right,you'd better all sit down where you can Sir Patrick would you like to come and sit on the throne I think it is more comfortable there, come on,up you go Oopsy Daisy B.B, I think you're more comfortable there too -How kind -I get you a cushion. Thank you -One and two -Excellent - Comfortable? - Most -May I take your hat? -Please Walpole,about you,you might sit on this,it's really quite comfortable BTW, I'll trouble you for my cigaret case,if you don't mind? What cigaret case? The gold one I lent to you at the Star and Garters -Was that yours? -Yes My dear chap,I'm terribly sorry I wondered whose it was But this is all what is left of it No,no,fine,that's yours. A pawn ticket It's all right,it's perfectly safe and he can't sell it for a year Oh Walpole I'm most terribly sorry. No,no,please don’t mention it. It adds to your fascination. Before we go any further, you have a debt to pay I have a precious lot of debts to pay, Ridgeon. I'll shall get you a chair. You shall not leave this room until he's paid It's a small one but pay him too must and shall I do not mind you borrowing 10 £ of one of my guest and 20 £ of another No,no I walked into that when I offered They can afford it but to strip poor Blenkinsop off his last half crown that was damnable I need to give him back that half-crown and be in a position to pledge my word that you paid it -I'll have that out of you, at all events -All right,don't fuss,don't fuss Of course I should pay Quite right,Ridgeon,come on young fellow,down with the dust I had no idea the poor fellow was hard up. I am as shocked about as the rest of you Here you are Except that I have no money on me at present Would you mind lending me half-a crown,Walpole?Just to settle it Lend you half a crown? Well if you don't, Blenkinsop won't get it for I haven't a rap you may search my pockets if you care That’s conclusive. There I really am glad that's settled, it's been on my conscience -Then I hope you are all satisfied -Not quite,Mr Dubedat Do you happen to know a young woman called Minnie? Minnie? Yes,I should say I do and Minnie knows me too She's a nice good girl,Minnie, I wonder what ever became of her? It's no use bluffing, Dubedat. We've seen Minnie's marriage lines. Indeed? Have you seen Jennifer's? You mean to insinuate that Mrs Dubedat is living with you without being married to you? Why not? -Why not? -Why not Why not? Yes,why not? Lots of people do it. Just as good people as you Why don’t you chaps learn to think instead of bleating and blighing like a lot of sheep when you come up against something you don't understand I must say I should like to draw the lot of you You look jolly foolish Especially you, Ridgeon -I had you that time, you know -How, pray? You claim to appreciate Jennifer, but you despise me,don’t you? -I loathe you. -Just so And yet you are prepared to believe that Jennifer is a bad lot simply because you think I told you so. What did you tell her? I merely asked you whether you'd seen Jennifer's marriage lines and you concluded straight away that she hadn’t got any You don't know a lady when you see one -What do you mean by that? -Pray,I am only an immoral artist But if you told me that Jennifer wasn't married I should have had the gentlemanly feeling and artistic instinct to say that she carried her marriage certificate in her face and character But you are all moral men and Jennifer is only an artist's wife A model And morality consists in suspecting other people of not being legally married Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Can one of you look me in the face after it? Its very difficult to look you in the face,Dubedat you have such a dazzling cheek. What about Minnie eh? Minnie Tinwell is a young woman who has had three glorious weeks of happiness in her poor little life Which is more than most girls in her position get,I can tell you Just you ask her whether she'd take it back if she could She's got her name into history that girl She'll have a page in my biography My little sketches of her will be fought for by collectors at Christie's Pretty good,that I think, for a still-room maid at a seaside hotel What have you chaps done for her to compare with that? We haven't trapped her into a marriage and deserted her No,you wouldn’t have the pluck But don’t fret yourselves. I didn't desert little Minnie -We spent all our money -Her money,you mean. All our money,I said,hers and mine. Her thirty pounds didn't last three days I had to borrow four times as much to spend on her I didn't grudge it,when we were cleaned out,we'd had enough of it You can hardly suppose that we were fit company for longer than that I,an artist, and she quite out of art and literature and refined living and all that sort of thing There was no desertion, no misunderstanding,no police court Nothing for you chaps to lick your lips over at breakfast We simply said, the money's gone We've had a wonderful time that nobody can ever take from us She went back to service, and I went off to Brittany -Two years later I met Jennifer -And committed bigamy Bigamy,bigamy,bigamy What a fascination anything connected with the police has for you moralists! Did you tell Jennifer that you were already married? Of course not.Don't you see that if she had known it would have spoiled everything for her I had to think of her self-respect What are we to do with this daisy? Oh, go and do whatever the devil you please. Put Minnie in the witness box Put me in prison. Kill Jennifer with the disgrace of it all And then,when you've done all the mischief you can go to church and feel good about it -He's got us you know -He has Is he to be allowed to defy the law of the land? The law,it won't do Minnie any good and only lay his wife's life waste. You can put the law out of your head once for all Sir Patrick You turn your head just a little more this way,no,no there's too much Put down your foolish pencil ,man and think of your position You can defy the laws made by men but there are the laws to reckon it You know that you're going to die -We're all going to die aren't we? -We are not all going to die in six months How do you know? Upon my soul,I will not stand this It is in questionable taste under any circumstances or in any company to harp on the subject of death It is a monstrous advantage to take of a medical man I will not allow it, do you understand? I didn't start it,you fellows did It's always the way with the inartistic professions With all your talk you've only one trump card in your hand and that’s intimidation Well,whatever I am,I'm not a coward,so it doesn't bother me I'll tell you what you are,Sir. You are a scoundrel Oh, I don't mind you calling me a scoundrel in the very least It's only a word,the word you don't know the meaning of -What is a scoundrel? -You are a scoundrel! Just,Sir, I am a scoundrel What is a scoundrel? I am. It's just arguing round the circle And you call yourself a man of science? I have a very good mind to take you by the scruff of your neck and give you a sound hiding I jolly wish you would You'd pay quite a handsome price to keep it out of the law courts You know our opinion of you now,at all events You are on the wrong track altogether. I am not a criminal All your moralizing have no value for me. I don't believe in morality Good afternoon Sir Patrick,please don't go,I didn't mean to shock you,on my honor I don't mind sparing here a few more minutes.But don’t address yourself to me For I've retired from practice and I don't pretend to be able to cure your complaint Your life is in the hands of these gentlemen Not in mine I won't lift a finger to save him And what do you say,Mr. Walpole? I like to take him in hand,I don't mind It's clear to me that he's suffering from some obscure form of blood-poisoning Which is almost certainly due to an accumulation of ptomaines in the nuciform sac. I will remove the sac You mean to operate on me? No thank you. Don't be afraid.You won't feel anything. You'll be under an anesthetic,of course. It should be be extraordinary interesting Oh,well, if it would be of interest to you, and if it wont hurt,that’s another matter How much will you pay me to let you do it? How much? What do you mean? Well, you don't imagine to let you cut me up for nothing,do you? Would you paint my portrait for nothing? No,I'll give you the painting when its finished You could sell it afterward for perhaps the double prize But I can't sell my nuciform sac when you've cut it out,can I? Richard,did you ever hear of anything like that? You can keep your nuciform sac One would almost think I was conferring a favor on the fellow! That leaves only one medical man who has not withdrawn from the case,Mr Dubedat. You have nobody now to appeal to but Sir Ralph Bloomfield Bonington If I were you, B. B.,I shouldn't touch him with a pair of tongs Let him take his lungs to some hospital They wont cure him but they might as well teach him manners My difficulty is that I have never been able to say No even to the most thoroughly undeserving people What is our young friend here? A vicious and ignorant young man with a talent for drawing. But then, what are the majority of my patients? Vicious and ignorant young men without any talent for anything No,having made a promise to his wife,to stimulate the phagocytes stimulate them I shall Well, Mr Dubedat,as Sir Ralph has kindly offered to take charge of the case Then allow me to excuse me Yes,Sir Patrick,I'm quite finished with you While you've been talking, I've been doing.What's the result of your moralizing? A little carbonic acid gas which made the room unhealthy The result of mine? There -You young rascal -That's right and good I wish I could afford to give it to you as a gift,Sir Patrick But I'd really pay five guineas rather than part from it. - I give 6 for it - And I give you 10. I think Sir Patrick is morally entitled to it,after all, he sat for it. May I send it to your house, Sir Patrick,for 12 guineas? Twelve guineas! Not if you were President of the Royal Academy,young man I shall take it for 12 guineas Accept it from me, Paddy and may you long be spared to contemplate it. Thank you B.B. I shall not settle with you now, my fees will come to more than that Well,of all the means.I consider you've stolen that drawing So we've converted you to a belief in morality after all, eh? My hat You chaps have said some pretty hard things to me here in my own home I don’t mind that,I'm a man and can look after myself. I'm going to call Jennifer in now and when she comes I would be grateful if you remember that she is a lady. And you are supposed to be gentlemen Jennifer Good Day to you Come,come lay out and put out your countenance I am not out of countenance,by Jupiter I should like to see the fellow who could put me out of countenance Thank you all so much for coming. Mrs Dubedat.How are we today? Life has been worth living since I have known you And it used to be nothing but fear Won't you all come in and tell me the result of the consultation? Sir Colenso I'll go if you don't mind, Mrs Dubedat,I have an appointment If I am needed,and needed I shall be finally Well,then you know where to find me I am always at your service,Mrs Dubedat I too must ask you to excuse me,Madam Sir Patrick There’s nothing wrong, is there? You don’t find Louis worse? No,he is not worse. Just the same Thank you,you frightened me Mrs Dubedat, if I have to have the charge of the patient You! But I thought that Sir Colenso-- My dear lady, your husband is to have Me No,please not another word,it'll be a pleasure to do it for your sake But Colenso Sir Colenso will be in his rightful place, at the bacteriological laboratory I shall be in my rightful place,at the bedside Your husband will be treated exactly as if he was a member of the royal family No,no,please,don't thank me, that would only embarrass me On Tuesday next,we shall start to stimulate the phagocytes,I'll let you know later Colly,send me down on Tuesday some of that very excellent antitoxin Goodbye,my dear lady,rely on me Eat well, sleep regularly,keep happy Keep the patient's spirits up,remember there is no tonic like a beautiful woman No medicine like cheerfulness,drive on, no resource like science,Goodbye, Goodbye Jinny Jinny Where are you? Emmy Emmy Mrs Dubedat! I know I ought to be very grateful. Believe me, I am very grateful What's the matter? I had set my heart on you curing Louis. Well,so is Bloomfield Bonington Yes, I know, I know,it is a great privilege to have him.But oh,I wish it had been you I know it's unreasonable, I can't explain but I had such a strong instinct that you would cure Louis I don't,I cant feel the same about Sir Ralph You promised me. Why did you give Louis up? I told you I cannot take another case But at Richmond? At Richmond I thought I could take another case But that place has been claimed by my old friend Dr Blenkinsop His lung is affected Do you mean that man,that rather silly I mean the gentleman who dined with us He's an excellent and honest man, whose life is as valuable as anyone else's I have arranged to take his case and Sir Ralph Bloomfield Bonington will take Mr Dubedat's I see what it is Oh! It is mean,cruel and envious And I thought that you were above such a thing. What do you mean? Do you think I don’t know? Do you think it has never happened before? Why does everyone turn against him? Can you not forgive him for being superior to you? For being cleverer? For being braver? For being a great artist? Yes,I can forgive him all that Well, have you anything to say against him? I have challenged everyone who has turned against him challenged them face to face to tell me any wrong thing he had done any ignoble thought he had uttered. They have always confessed that they could not tell me one. I challenge you now. What are you accusing him of? I am like all the rest Face to face,I cannot tell you one thing against him. But your manner is changed And you have broken your promise I think you are being a little unreasonable You have had the best medical advice in London and his case has been taken in hand by a leader of the profession,surely It's so cruel to keep telling me that It sounds right and it puts me in the wrong,but I'm not in the wrong I have faith in you and I have no faith in the others We have seen many doctors I have come at last to know when they are only talking and can do nothing It is different with you. I feel that you know. You must listen to me doctor I know Louis as nobody else knows him or can ever know him.I am his wife I know he has little faults sensitiveness,impatience even little selfishness which are too trivial for him to notice. I know that he sometimes shocks people about money because he is so utterly above it and can't understand the value ordinary people set on it Tell me,did he borrow money from you? He asked me for some once Oh,I'm sorry,I'm so sorry but he will never do it again I pledge you my word for that He has given me his promise and he is incapable of breaking his word That was his only real weakness . And now it is conquered and done with forever Was that really his only weakness? He is perhaps sometimes weak about women because they adore him so, and are always laying traps for him And of course when he says he doesn’t believe in morality ordinary pious people think he must be wicked. But you understand, can't you, how all this starts a great deal of gossip about him and gets repeated until even his good friends get set against him? Yes,I understand Oh,if you only knew the other side of him as I do! You know, doctor, that if Louis dishonored himself by a really bad action I should kill myself - Come now! Don't exaggerate - I should You don't understand that? You don't know me. I should like to Tell me about yourself I had a great many dreams But at last they all came to one dream -The usual dream -Is it usual? As I guess,but you haven't told me what it was I knew that man of genius always had a terrible struggle at first With poverty and neglect My dream was to save one of them from that,and bring some happiness into his life Louis was not like the other men I met Only fancy, doctor,he never even wanted to marry me He never thought of the things other men think of! I had to propose it myself. Then he said he had no money When I told him I had some, he said "Oh, all right," just like a boy. He is still like that,quite unspoiled A man in his thoughts a great poet and artist in his dreams and child in his ways I gave him myself and all I had that he might grow to his full height with plenty of sunshine If I lost faith in him, it would mean the wreck and failure of my whole life Then I shall die You must cure him,doctor You must make him quite well again for me I know that you can do it, and that nobody else can Doctor,I implore you not to refuse what I am going to ask you to do Take Louis yourself and let Sir Ralph cure Dr Blenkinsop Mrs Dubedat Do you really believe in my knowledge and skill as you say you do? Absolutely. I do not give my trust by halves I know that Well, I'm going to test you hard Will you believe me when I say,no doubt, understood what you have just told me? And my only wish is to serve you in the most faithful friendship? and that your hero must be preserved to you Oh forgive me,forgive what I said. You will preserve him to me. At all hazards Wait Let me finish Will you believe me when I say that the one chance of preserving your hero lies in Louis being in the care of Sir Ralph? If you say so, I believe you. I have no more doubt Thank you Sir Ralph,I am with the 'The Globe'.I wonder if you could.. Young man,there's a time and place for everything This is neither time nor the place. What happened? He has got through three months galloping consumption in three days B. B. got in on the negative phase . Negative or positive, the lad's done for He wont last out the afternoon. He'll go suddenly,I've often seen it Let's hope he goes out before she finds him out It's a little hard on a poor lad to be killed because his wife has too high an opinion of him Fortunately few of us are in any danger of that Ah, there you are, Ridgeon. You heard of course Yes By Jupiter,it's a fascinating case you know if I didn’t know as a matter of scientific fact that I'd been stimulating the phagocytes I should say I'd been stimulating the other things instead Paddy,what's your explanation? Colly,how do we account for it? Have we overstimulated the phagocytes? Have they begun to prey on the lungs themselves? Or on one another? I must write a paper about this case Fascinating Oh B.B. You've done it this time - What do you mean? - Killed him The worst case of neglected blood-poisoning I ever saw It's too late to operate now. He'd die under the anesthetic Really,if your monomania wasn't so well known I should take that remark very seriously,indeed Come come! When you've both killed as many people as I have in my time you'll feel humble enough about it Come and look at him,Colly I apologize, B. B. But it's blood-poisoning Well,of course,everything is blood-poisoning But upon my soul, I shall never use any of that stuff of Ridgeon's again made me so sensitive about what you said just now was,strictly between ourselves Ridgeon cooked our young friend's goose Sir Ralph,what am I to do? This man is from a newspaper An article appeared this morning saying that Louis is seriously ill He wants to interview him about it How can people be so brutally callous? Just you leave him to me But Louis insists on seeing him He almost began to cry about it And he says he cant bear his room any longer He says he wants to see his studio for the last time. Sir Patrick says to let him have his way,it can do no harm -What shall we do? -Follow Sir Patrick's excellent advice Of course,he said it could do no harm and it may do good,a great deal of good He'll be all better for it Then Mr Walpole,will you tell the man that he may come in But that he mustn't exhaust Louis by talking? Of course Sir Ralph Please don't be angry with me but Louis will die if he stays here Let me take him to Brittany I know he will recover Brittany? Of course,the very place for him How stupid of me not to have thought of it myself You are his best physician after all, dear lady,it's a wonderful place for lungs -Brittany is of course an inspiration -Oh,Sir Ralph,you're very kind But,don't give me too much hope,or I shall cry -And Louis can't bear that -Then we'll go and fetch him in here Brittany of course That's the very place This is his studio, I suppose Yes Where he has his models, eh? No doubt about it Are you one of the family or the doctor? I'm neither one nor the other. I am Mr Cutler Walpole. Mr Butler... Perhaps I'd better write it for you, you'd be sure to get it wrong That what comes of belonging to an illiterate profession Oh I say,you have got your knife into us,haven't you? I wish I had,yes,I'd make a better man of you Now,attend,Mr. Dubedat would be brought in here presently He wants to talk to you because he doesn't know how bad he is We'll allow you to wait for a few minutes only to humor him but if you talk to him,out you go. He may die at any moment Is he as bad as that? I say,I'm in luck today Sit down over there and keep quiet Here we are. This is where you belong You'll be painting again in no time That's happiness To be in the studio Happiness -Jennifer -Yes,my darling Is the newspaper man here? Yes Mr Dubedat,here I am,at your service. I represent the press I thought you might like to let us have a few words about about,well, on your illness, and your plans for the season My plans for the season Are very simple -I'm going to die -Oh Louis Darling,I'm very weak and tired Don't put on me the horrible strain of pretending I don’t know I've been lying in there listening to the doctors Laughing to myself They know Darling,don't cry.It makes you ugly, I can't stand that My love,my love don't talk -It will only waste your strength. -It only uses it up -If Mrs Dubedat,if you could possibly -Mr Walpole,please Ridgeon,give me something to keep me going Not one of your confounded antitoxins,if you don’t mind I have some things to say before I go I suppose it can do no harm? In milk. Don't set him coughing Jennifer -I want you to promise me something -Yes,dear,you know I will If there’s one thing I hate more than another, it's a widow Promise me that you'll never be A widow What do you mean? I want you to look beautiful I want people to see in your eyes that you were married to me In Italy People used to point to Dante and say: "There goes the man who's been in hell." I want them to point at you and say "There goes the woman who's been in heaven." It has been heaven, darling,hasn't it? Sometimes? Yes,always,always If you wear black and cry, people will say: "Look at that miserable woman, her husband has made her miserable." No,never.You've been the light and the blessing of my life I have never lived until I knew you Then you must always wear beautiful dresses And splendid magic jewels. Think of all the wonderful paintings I shall never paint You must be transfigured with all the beauty of those pictures There must be a great tradition of beauty A great atmosphere of wonder and romance That's what men must always think of when they think of me That's the sort of immortality I want Promise me that immortality Promise me you won't make a little hell of crying and crape And undertaker's horrors and withering flowers and all that -That vulgar rubbish -I promise. But all that is far off, dear You are to come to Brittany with me and get well Sir Ralph says so Poor old B.B. Poor fellow! Brains going Jennifer Do you remember the burning bush? Oh yes Oh my dear, how it strains my heart to sense it now! Does it? It fills me with joy Tell them about it It was nothing only that once in Brittany We lit the first fire of the winter and when we looked through the window in the garden then we saw the flames dancing in a burning bush Such a colour Garnet color. Waving like silk Liquid lovely flame flowing up through the bay leaves, and not burning them I shall be a flame I'm sorry to disappoint the poor little worms but the last of me shall be the flame in the burning bush When you see the flame,Jennifer That will be me -You will marry,again,Jennifer. -Oh,Louis,how can you Yes, because people who have found marriage happy always marry again All right,I shan't be jealous Only don’t talk about me too much to the other fellow,he won't like it I shall be your lover all the time but it will be a secret from him poor devil! Come! You've talked enough. Try to rest a while Yes,I'm fearfully tired I shall have a long rest presently I have something to say to you,fellows -You are all there,aren't you? -Yes,we are all here. That voice sounded devilish Take care,Ridgeon My ears hear things that other people's ears can't And I've been thinking I'm cleverer than you imagine You've got on his nerves,Colly. Slip out quietly Would you deprive the dying actor of the audience? I heard that,Ridgeon That was good I know what you think of me I'm not ashamed I've been threatened... and blackmailed.. and insulted... and shelved Now that it's all over... There's an indescribable peace Michelangelo... Rembrandt... Velasquez The mystery of colour Beauty everlasting I should like to rest my head on your bosom Only It might -tire you -Louis,how could you tire me? That's good.That’s real. Don't spare me,dear Indeed, indeed you will not tire me Lean on me with all your weight Jinny Gwinny I think I shall recover after all Suddenly... Suddenly I want to sleep Just an ordinary sleep Yes, dear Oh,sleep Do not disturb him That's right dear,lean on me with all your weight,now you are really resting Let me put him back on his pillow, Madame it's better for him. No he's not tiring me He will be so hurt when he wakes if he finds I have put him away He will never wake again Is he dead? Yes Will you wait for me a moment? I will come back Ought we to follow her? Is she all right? Yes.She's all right. Leave her alone. Poor young fellow.He died splendidly Aye! that is how the wicked die When you are old as I am you realize that it matters really little how a man dies What matters is how he lives No matter,there's no concern of ours he is in an another world now Probably borrowing his first 5 £ note Come,come,don't let us be hard on him. Not now Not now After all,he had only two failings: Money and women All these affairs are so well arranged at present that a disregard of the usual arrangements indicates real depravity? Confound the usual arrangements! What I mind his utter disregard of everything but his own His own pocket,his own fancies Don’t waste your time wrangling about him A blackguard's a blackguard, an honest man's an honest man Perhaps,perhaps Still, de mortuis nil nisi bonum.. I think it was Shakespeare,who said that the good that men do lives after them the evil is often interred in their bones Interred in their bones We're all mortal,Ridgeon that's common lot,Paddy Say what you will,Walpole That your debt must be paid If not today,then it'll be tomorrow. To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow After life's fitful... I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.. -I'm sorry I kept you waiting. -It doesn't matter,quite all right I felt that I must shake hands with his friends once before we part today We have shared together a great happiness and a great privilege Life will always be beautiful to us Death will always be beautiful to us May we shake hands on that? Remember,all letters had better be left to your solicitor Let him open everything and settle everything. That’s the law, you know Thank you,I didn't know Good bye,Mrs Dubedat I blame myself I should have insisted operating Good bye,dear lady I shall send the proper people,they'll know what to do,you'll have no trouble Good bye Mrs Dubedat I said his friends,Sir Colenso Jennifer Jennifer The last of me is the flame in the burning bush When you see the flame,Jennifer That will be me This way,please You can put it down there. -Thank you -Thank you,Mam,thank you Mrs Dubedat -Dr Blenkinsop? -Yes,certainly I wonder if I might have a word with you? Thank you You look the fit of health and prosperity Yes,I've been made a Medical Officer of Health,you see I was successful in curing the Chairman of the Borough Council With Dr. Colenso Ridgeon's medicine? Oh,no,I believe it was with a pound of the right greengages I've been very fortunate You have indeed been very fortunate Your life has been spared Mrs Dubedat,I know what you must be feeling I felt I had to came and tell you I had no idea I didn't know that there was to be a choice between your husband's life and mine And how do you know? Your husband was a great artist He cannot be replaced,but I can. Thank you But please don't blame Sir Colenso. We were old friends It was not for his friendship to you that I blame Sir Colenso I had quite forgotten There is somebody coming to see Louis's paintings They are going to collect them, will you please forgive me Thank you Good Afternoon,how kind of you to come.
