[BARKS] Down. Quiet, bloodhound. To the lions with them. After them, you idiots. Capture those men. Well, hurry! Ow. Ow. Sh. Did you see them? Do you think they got away? MAN: Oh. What are we going to do? I wouldn't hurt those guys. They're three nice fellows. [GRUNTS] Oh, so you think they're three nice guys? Yeah. They always pay their income tax on time. CURLY: They don't owe a cent in the world. Oh, they don't, huh? CURLY: No. [GRUNTS] How long have you known these fellows? Well, I'll tell you, I-- [GROANS] Sh. I'll get this guy. [SOBBING] I don't want to be empress. [SCREAMS] [MOE SCREAMS] Quiet, toots. Listen, we're your friends. We've come here to get you out. But how?

If you think I'm gonna let that guy snuggle up to me, you're crazy. How long is this gonna keep up? You just keep stallin' until Diana makes her escape. Soon as he gets in he'll recognize me. Don't you worry. I'll take care of that. Every time you take care of that, I get it. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Just a minute, Occy. Make it a short minute, my little kelp fish. Kelp fish. Go on. Get sexy. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Oh, emperor, we're sorry. We're sorry. It was an accident. And your glasses, they're broken. [SIGHS] Even without my glasses, you're ravishing. [BARKS QUIETLY] I bet you tell that to all the boys-- I mean girls. How about a kiss, my little sardine? No, no. I'm no sardine, and there'll be no kiss. [LAUGHS] Oh, please. You'll spoil my makeup. [GIGGLES] At least we can toast your beauty with sparkling wine. Here's to you, my little halibut. [LAUGHS] Uh-oh. I forgot to have it tasted. Here. Taste this. MOE AND LARRY: For me? Thanks, pal. He said taste it. He didn't invite you to lunch. I have to be very careful. My last three tasters were poisoned. [CURLY LAUGHS] Did you hear that? It's a royal mickey. [MAN SNORING] Okay, Occy, real vintage. Fine. After you, my love. After all, ladies first. Oh, no. Emperors always first. To our undying love. He means dying love. Oh. Oh.
