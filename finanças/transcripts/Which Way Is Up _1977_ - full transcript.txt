You're gonna be late for work, sonny boy. You Jones? No, sir. Well, then. If you should happen to see Mr. Jones, you give him something for me? Hmm? It's a bus ticket. I believe he's got a truck. The company would like it better if Mr. Jones left by bus. If I see him, I'll tell him. It's one... One way? Leroy! Hey, don't worry about me. Shit, I'll be all right. Still got my truck. That's right, I'm going to the city. I'm going into business for myself. Do some trucking. Sir! Mister, that, uh... Sir! "Dear Annie Mae and Pops. "Living in the city is like living in the country, only faster. "I wanted to live in decent surroundings, "so I found a fine building in the best part of town. "My apartment is on the top floor overlooking the city "and it's close to churches, schools and businesses. "And I've made many new friends. "Many of which are in the Movement. "Sometimes they drop by late at night for intellectual discussions." You gotta pay me! Baby, what you mean? I already paid you! Get your hands off me! Till you get your... You guys are in the wrong room! Get your hands off me! Get your hands off me! I said you're in the wrong... You're in the wrong room. I'm gonna break your goddamn neck! I'm gonna break it for getting into that room! Listen. You guys, listen to me. I'm gonna kill you! You're in the wrong... Miss, Miss... Sorry... "As for the employment situation, "people here recognize a natural leader when they see one. "They wanted me to start out as an executive, "but I told 'em no! I start out at the bottom like everybody else, "and then, maybe my natural leadership potential will "take me right to the top. I'll send money home. "I would have sent it this time, but I've already sealed up the envelope." Hey, Frankie, come here. Look at this. That's him. Yeah, that's him. Hey, is that you? No! Sure is. Sure is you, man. Wait, hold on! Hold on. Hey, hey, come on! What's going on out here? This guy worked with Juarez! Helped him organize! You worked with Ramon Juarez? Well, yeah. I almost lost my job for it. You know, the goons come at me. In the night. Fifty of them! But I fought 'em off! They had clubs and bricks, dogs, cats, everything! I stood there. Stood my ground. All right! My man! This man's a brother. He's been there! He's seen it all! Listen, Boatwright, you gotta give this guy at least a casual card. Yeah, yeah, we'll do something nice. Geez, I just didn't... I had no idea. Congratulations. Thank you. That takes courage. Does this mean I get the job? Find out about the Farm Workers. Take one of these, please. It explains the Farm Workers Movement. Hey, Mister, you drink orange juice, don't you? Find out about it, please? Read it. Good reading. Would you like one of these, sir? Farm Workers Movement. It explains the Farm Workers Movement. Hey, Leroy. Where you going? I'm going to the bathroom. Well, come on. We gotta finish up by noon. Sir, would you like one of these? Affiliated Farm Workers Movement? Excuse me, sir, would you please vote for the Affiliated Farm Workers Movement? Would you like to read about the AFW, our new union? It's the Farm Workers. Not the growers, the workers. Would you like one, Miss? Oh, I gave you two. Here, I'll take one back. Please read it. Would you like one, Miss? Could I have one of those, please? Of course you can. I'm very interested in the Movement. Are you? Good. Would you like one of these, Miss? Please read. AFW, our new union. I'm really interested in the struggle. Have a nice day, okay? Hey, Leroy! Let's stick together, you guys. Support the AFW. Don't buy oranges. Hey, Leroy, come on, man, we're gonna be here all day if you don't stop looking at that broad. I knew you'd be here today. Yeah? How'd you know that? Psychic. Psychic? I was born with a veil over my face, you know? My father was born with seven veils over his face. He ain't psychic. Where you from? Barnes County. What you doing so far away from home? I got run off. You got run off? I was working with Ramon Juarez, helping him organize the field workers. Juarez? The Affiliated Farm Workers Union? Yeah, that's the one. Look. The goons come and chased me off in the night. Must have been 100 of them. That's Juarez there with the mustache, and that's me. "The Man Who Made His Move." You actually helped to start the Union? I just did what I had to do. What was it really like out there on the line? Hard. Lonely. Mostly, it was lonely. No friends, no family. Just my brothers and sisters in the Movement. Viva La Causa. Viva La Causa. You're a brave man, Leroy. And you're good, too. I got a feeling about you. I got a feeling about you, too. You do? You've got to have been watching me watch you. I have. I mean, I feel like I've known you all my life. Me too. Like, uh, like the Union! Like something that's gotta be. I know what you mean. You do? Mmm-hmm. You think maybe I could have one kiss to sort of seal our solidarity. Between brother and sister in the struggle? Yeah. Yeah. Brother and sister in the struggle. Hey! Hey... Get off me! You got to have me, right? You're crazy! I'm crazy for you! Yeah! You're crazy! I broke my arm! Don't flatter yourself! If anything's broken, I broke it! I just got carried away. If you touch me again, you will be carried away! But what about brother and sister and the Movement? I was a fool for giving you the time of day! Wait a minute! Please, I love you! Please, give me another chance. You don't understand. I love you. I made a mistake. Please? Do you want me to get you some more tea? Yeah, I'd like a little more. Okay. God, you're beautiful. Thank you. I mean, people beautiful. I've had a good day with you, uh, you know... I never thought I could feel this way about things or express it. Because I always thought it was silly, you know, to be vulnerable. And I find it easy to talk to you. And tell you how I feel and what I wanna do and what I don't wanna do. It's sure a hell of a relief, I'll tell you that. And I'm sorry I won't be able to see you anymore. Why not? Because I'm in love with you. And I don't think I could stand just to be around you and not have you for my lady. So I'm gonna go. It's been a beautiful day. And I think you're decent people. Thank you. Leroy, don't go. If I stay, what's gonna happen with us? I don't know about you, but I'm gonna take a shower. Leroy. What? I know you love me and I think I understand you, but I can't do anything halfway. It's like the Movement. When I commit, it's all or nothing. That's the only way it should be. Then you have to make me a promise. What? That you won't make love to any other woman, even your wife, or I'll leave you forever. I promise. Then I'm yours. "Dear Leroy, thank you for the money you sent us "and for the birthday present. "Things are pretty good here now that I got me a job "in the five-and-dime where Thelma works. "I'm learning a lot about life and meeting new people. "The weather up here has been hot... "Dear Leroy, I've got a surprise. "I got a promotion at work after only six months! "With the extra money, I put a down payment on a cute little car. "It rides real good. "Now Thelma and I can go wherever we want. "It's wonderful to be free. "Guess what, Leroy. I found a great new dress... "Dear Leroy, I can't believe it's been more than a year since you left. "There's been lots of changes here. "Sorry I haven't written in a while, but I've been real busy. "Life in Barnes County isn't so bad after all. "I'll write again when I have more time. Love, Annie Mae." Okay, hold it. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale and push! Okay. Relax. Relax, relax. Come on. Oh, honey. You're not gonna be nervous when the labor starts for real are you? No, baby, I got this shit down pat. That's good, 'cause it's starting now! Huh? Jesus, no! Wait. No, wait till the thing gets on 12. No, breathe, breathe. Listen, just breathe. Just pant. Pant! We shouldn't have done this shit. I told you we should've got a doctor. Perfect baby, transcendent son of the light. Thou art a wave of the inter-ocean of cosmic consciousness behind you. Wear your name with pride and with honor. Namaste. What do you think of your son now, Leroy? He's got a hell of a set of nuts on him. I'll drink to that. I want to propose a toast. To the parents, the child and the flow of life. To the Movement! To the Movement! Cheers! Hey, pal, give me some of that, will you? Good, good. Oh, honey, that's what we forgot. The grape juice! Everybody doesn't like this carrot juice, you know? I'll go upstairs and get it. Yeah. Everybody just party-hardy, okay? Okay, honey. Decent wages, decent working conditions, no kids in the fields. It's time the growers learn that they can't scare everybody. We're not afraid. We're going to go on and on and on until we win! Windows have been broken, your car tires slashed. One worker even had his pickup truck crushed by a bulldozer for just coming out of the fields to talk to me. Our struggle is a nonviolent struggle. We have been struggling for 12 years. Excuse me. I didn't see your face! My baby's being baptized. Want a drink? You're lucky to be alive, fella. Yes, sir. Never seen any... I seen everything! I mean, I was coming around the corner, the guy had the shotgun. I saw him myself. I never thought I'd ever seen it... They won't get... I saw every detail of the man's face. I know exactly what he looks like. Never. I come around the corner, the guy had a shotgun! He tried to kill me! Is this our witness? Huh? Captain Caine. Captain? Right on, right on, man! I saw it! Hey, just relax. There's nothing to worry about. You're in good hands. Thank you. Just because the Syndicate murders his eyewitness, there's no need for you to be afraid. I'm not afraid... Just relax you can tell us everything. I saw everything. I mean, I really did. My cigarette's out. Let me light it for you. Listen to me. The guy was like this close to me! He was so close... I couldn't see anything! Leroy. Huh? Leroy, did you see anything? Yes, I saw a woman! A short woman with two tall midgets. But you saw the man! Ah, no, the woman had wings! Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones, it's okay. Thank you for taking your time to talk to us. You can go now. I can go? You can go. Jesus, here's your tablecloth! Honey, are you all right? Jesus, baby, we gotta go! I didn't see nothing! Hey, Leroy, what happened? Uh, come on! What's going on? We gotta go home! What did happen? How come you're all dirty? Jesus Christ! What were you doing with those men? What is going on? What did they want with you? Just keep going. Don't ask questions! Jones? You Leroy Jones? Leroy Jones? Yeah? They want you upstairs. They want me? Yes, they want you. What for? They didn't tell me, but you better hurry, they don't like to wait. Leroy! Leroy Jones, how are you? Huh? Nice seeing you. Come on, I want you to meet somebody. Who? Juarez! Don't let that worry you, it's all right. Don't worry. I want you to meet somebody. Sir. This is Leroy... Sir, this is Leroy Jones, from the painting gang. That's fine, fine. Glad to see you getting along well. Well, I suppose you're wondering why you're up here? Heard your union is a member of the Agrico family, and the company is very pleased at the way you behaved. Mr. Jones, you're a man who knows when to speak up and when to shut up. Leroy. Come here. Come here, come here. Leroy, you have a rare quality among men. When people think you've seen something, well, it turns out you haven't seen anything at all. That's marvelous. We think you'll like Barnes County. Barnes County? We want a man with experience, and that's you, boy. Lot of people have their eye on you, boy. You're moving up in the world. Take advantage of it. Sir! Gosh! Gee, this is good shooting! That's good. I didn't wanna come here either, baby. You know that. But everywhere I looked I kept seeing rings. Least we're here with friends and I don't have to worry about nothing happening to you or Leroy Junior. I know, honey. It's all right. I'll follow you anywhere on this earth. Just don't forget your promise you made to me. Baby, Annie Mae don't mean nothing to me. I'm just gonna stay with her for appearances, make 'em think I'm a company man. You're the only one I want. You the only one. You better scoot down a little. Where we going? - The man gave me the keys. - Said it's for management. Is it near your wife and family? They're on the other side of town. I got Annie Mae covered. I don't wanna cause a hassle, Leroy. I'm proud to be here with my woman and baby boy and I don't care who knows it. All right, son. Now take your best shot. Let me see what you got now. Nigger, you play good enough to pass up 15? Watch out now! There it is. Hot damn! Double three. Janelle, where's the good frying pan? I just washed it this morning. Oh, here it is. Annie Mae, reach up under the sink there and gimme that big skillet. I hope that rice is cooking. Is that somebody at the window? I don't know. Oh, Leroy! Lord, I don't believe it. What the hell's that nigger doing back here? Is that your son? Daddy, Uncle Leroy's home. - Oh, you look so handsome... - Handsome? Leroy, welcome home! How you doing? Hello, Shane. Hi, Edna! How you doing? Hey, Pop! What the nigger done done now? We just moved in here, boy, I know you done fucked up! We got to move? What I done done now? I done come home an Agrico official and that's my car! Ooh! Look at my badge. Ooh, my ass. They give them white boys American cars. You gonna be a big executive now, huh, Leroy? Damn, Janelle, you sure feel beautiful. Oh, thank you. It ain't no big thing being no executive! I could've been an executive myself, woman! Back in '47! Brought you some champagne, Pop! Champagne? Ripple? Shit, you ain't lost your class, boy! Oh, Leroy, we so glad to see you home. He gonna get some of that, ain't he? Why don't we all go inside and drink some of that champagne? Okay. This is so nice! It's a surprise too! - Doesn't he look good, y'all? - Bust open some glasses. Here, I'll get 'em. Let me get 'em! Welcome home, sweet thing. Oh, 11:00. I got a busy day tomorrow. Gotta get up early. Work, work, work. Work, work, work. Good night, dear. Mmm. Good night. Leroy? You're really tired, huh? Yeah. Now, I'm sorry, Leroy. Me, too. I know just what you need. Thank you, ma'am. I knew you'd understand. Good night, Annie Mae. What the fuck is that? It's a marital aid. Turn it off. Turn it off. Do you know what that looks like? Mmm-hmm. How do you know? I read about it in Cosmopolitan. Jesus Christ. Not tonight, baby, I can't. Okay? I'm just all tied up. My legs hurt and my back, everything. Maybe Wednesday. This is Tuesday. Uh-huh. Good night. All you gotta do is keep your paperwork clean and your personnel happy and everything'll be A-number-one. You got that? Check. Ah, here they come. These are the new guys from personnel, sir. Okay. Here's your crew. Put 'em to work! Welcome aboard, Jones. Thank you, sir. Didn't I tell you he was a boss, man? I don't believe it. I told you guys I could get you a job here, if I have anything to say about it, which I do! And it sure beats slaving out in them orchards. Yeah, no rain, no flies, no stooping and no stretching. Yeah, and no union, brother. Well, pass them out. Follow me. Chuy, you still messing around with that union shit? I'm not messing around, man, I'm organizing. You organizing? With who? With Juarez, what else? Things haven't changed, you know? I mean, this place is just part of the chain, man. You know what I mean? Every orange that comes through here's got somebody's blood on it. But maybe with me and you in here, we can get something done. Something done like what? Well, strikes, man! You know, we can organize something. Huelga, man, this is our chance, brother! Oh, really? Because "this is our chance!" You know what happened to the last man that had my job tried to organize? They canned him! They fired him? No, they canned him! He's in supermarkets all over America! Chuy, Jose, Henry, Sugar. All right, you guys, I want you to get off the dime and let's move it! Let's not waste our time! Rufullio is gonna show you how to do this job and do it correctly. This is the citrus packing section. We like to say that if it's in your mouth, Agrico put it there. On your left, the canning division. On your right, pulp, and plenty of it. Another day, another dollar, your man's home. Hello, honey. Baby. Oh, I missed you so much. Missed you, too. Where's the baby? I spiked his bottle and I put him to bed. I brought you an apple. You did? How much time do we have? About three hours. One, two, three, go! Oh, I've been waiting for you all day! You won't be disappointed! Another day, another dollar, your man's home. Huh. I guess you're wondering why I'm so late? Something came up. Had an economic counsel today. I gotta know all that kind of stuff in the managerial part of Agrico Industries. Well, I'm enjoying it. I'm learning a lot of things I never knew before. Like for instance, we do over two million a week in pulp alone, did you know that? Leroy, you didn't say nothing about my new robe. Yeah, I noticed. It's pink. Very becoming. It matches your skin color! You learn a lot about color down there watching that fruit go by. For instance... Leroy, it's Wednesday! Time to take a bite of you, chocolate bar. Where is everybody? I gave them the money to go to a show in town. I thought we should be... alone. Jesus Christ, it's 7:30 already. I'm beat! But, Leroy, it's Wednesday. Leroy... Hmm? I'm sorry about last night. That's okay, dear. I mean, I know I was inconsiderate. And I also know you've been in the city and you're probably used to more sophisticated desires. Mmm-hmm. So tonight, I decided to give you what you really want! Say, what are you... Jesus! Wait! Behold the Baroness Monique! Oh, shit! For some people, pain is the only pleasure! I'm sorry, Leroy. But it hurt good, didn't it? Fuck, no! You naughty boy, you will be punished! Get me outta here, God... Shit! I'm gonna kill you, bitch. Relax. Submit! Enjoy. Yahoo! Enjoy! Yee! Oh, you lusty stallion, I'm gonna tame you. What are you gonna do with that? Submit! Enjoy! I'll tame you, you lusty stallion! Can I see Car Wash again? I liked that. I like it too, boy. That was some movie. What the hell's going on in there? Well, Leroy and Annie Mae must still be up. Ma, Uncle Leroy's playing horsey. Get back, children! Outside. Come on. Outside. Holy Jesus! Holy Jesus! Turned into a freak! Just like her mother! Oh, God! Lord have mercy! Annie Mae, girl, you... Damn, Annie Mae, you sure is built. Think I'll turn in. I'm beat! Probably sleep late. You sure is beat. Enjoy the movie? Double feature. Got any glue? Uh, Annie, I think it's good the way it is if we just put this part on the edge. Get that whip and that other chain there and follow me on in the kitchen. So, she says to the midget, "Check this out." And he said, "I would, if you put me up to it!" How about you, Annie Mae? You getting enough? Oh, Leroy and I, we doing fine. Much energy as Leroy got, I bet he's knocking that little man right out the boat. Oh, don't be so nasty. How often you do it? Once a night? Twice a week? What? Once a week? Uh... Oh... Mamita, Leroy is queer. Faggot! You think I'm a goddamn faggot? Hey, come on. Get in the car! Come on, get in the car! Come on! Get... Come on, come on! No, come on! Get in! Get in! Get in! You'll believe my ass! Get in the car. Get in the car. Don't touch me! I don't know. Leroy, what are you gonna do? Leroy! Leroy. What are you gonna do? Huh? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. - Faggot, huh? Huh? - Wait, wait, wait, Leroy. Wait, wait, Leroy! Come on, Leroy! You just wanna take it easy. Leroy! Come on, stop it! This is Leroy Jr. He was born at home. I helped bring him into the world. Natural childbirth. Mmm-hmm, and he's smart, too, just like his daddy. Oh, he's cute. Hi. Say hello to Uncle Chuy. I believe this calls for a toast. To Mr. Leroy Jones and to his very lovely, lovely lady. And to the Movement, who has brought us all here together. Let me show you around the rest of the house, okay? Come on. Come on, look around. My lady put this whole house together by herself. This is her garden. This is her pride and joy. She's a horticulturist. She fixes them plants, gives them love, they talk to her, that's what she says. It costs $400 a month here. These are the latest appliances that man has made. - I remember that day. - Do you? Yeah. That's a beautiful poster, ma'am. Thank you. You did that? Yes. You do work for the Farm Workers? Mmm-hmm. That's beautiful, ma'am. Leroy has everything. Two of everything. That's right, two women, two homes... I don't know how he does it. Good morning, sir. Good morning, men. We got 36 tons to move this morning. Don't worry, sir, we'll move it through for you. Anything you say, Patrone. You can depend on us. That's real good, because you're the finest crew in this plant. Now, move it! What's the matter? Chuy, just come here quick. Chuy, come here. Come here. What's the matter? Chuy, Chuy, Chuy, Chuy, have you seen Leroy? Yeah, he's out in the parking lot. What's the matter? It's the end of the world about to happen. We have got to catch Leroy before he gets home. Please. All right, all right. What's wrong? Annie Mae is pregnant. What? Annie Mae is pregnant. Well, so, we figured we'd come to you, being that you're the best qualified man to discuss this here matter with. Well, it's the Agrico way. If you can use my expertise in managerial matters, I'm glad to help you. It's in the nature of a sexual problem. Hmm. You see, this girl... Well, she's something like Annie Mae. Sort of quiet, frightened. Afraid of her own shadow. Anyway, this friend of mine is gonna have a baby. Now, that's beautiful. That can be a very organic and thrilling experience. And if the husband's involved, it can be very enlightening, also. It's... It's Annie Mae! Who's Annie Mae? My girlfriend what's gonna have the baby. Leroy! Annie Mae is having a baby and you ain't the daddy. And that's the God's truth! Oh, shit. And I'm sorry to be the one that got to tell you. Annie Mae ain't having no baby. Why not? 'Cause I'm gonna kill the bitch! Leroy! Leroy! Leroy, wait, wait. Leroy, wait, wait. Leroy! Wait! No, Leroy, no! Leroy! Leroy! Leroy! Leroy! I'm sorry, Leroy. You're sorry? Die, bitch, die! Go on and kill me! I don't deserve to live. You're goddamn right, you don't deserve to live! But before I kill you, you're gonna tell me who's the daddy. Oh, Lord. God damn it, who's the daddy of the baby? My spiritual counselor. Who the fuck is that? The Reverend Lenox Thomas! The... The Reverend Lenox Thomas? Yes. That potbellied, black, big-nosed, ugly, no-preaching nigger is the daddy of our baby? Yes. Of all the niggers in the world, it had to be that motherfucker? God, yes! I'll kill you! No, Leroy! I'll kill you. I'll kill you! God damn it! No, Leroy. I'll... God damn it! How'd it happen? I was looking for comfort in the church. You was looking for comfort... Oh, Leroy! Leroy! Yes! Why didn't you come to me? Huh? What? Oh. I know you couldn't. You got a problem. I got a problem? What? You're weak and cold, impotent, or worse! What's worse? You're a faggot! A faggot? You don't know nothing, you dumb poo-poo! I'll tell you what I am! I'm plenty of man, baby! When it come to fucking, I'm number uno! 'Cause I got a old lady across town, baby, and she loves it. You know what I mean? Not like you. She loves it! And I'll tell you another thing, Miss Smartass! We got a baby boy. Yeah! Leroy Jr. That's his name. And kiss my ass, and hallelujah! And I'll tell you something else. You mean, you made me think something was wrong with me? All the time you was fucking some bitch across town? I'll kill your ass, nigger. Dirty, low-down hound dog! No. God damn it! You let it go! Leroy, open the door, man! Open the door! Pop, she's got a knife! Goddamn, the bitch done gone berserk! Ow! Let go of that door, nigger! It's Leroy! Somebody gonna get killed... Open the door, Rufus! Annie Mae! Annie Mae! No, no! Annie Mae! Annie Mae! Oh, Jesus, done fucked up the house and everything! You lying, slow-footed, rusty-butted hound dog! Lying to me! Man, you okay, Leroy? I almost killed the bitch. Hey, you had enough? You want some more? Let go of me! I loved him! Look at him!

Wait a minute, will you? Leroy, Leroy, wait a minute! Leroy, wait. You can't. That's a church, man! Jesus, well, amen! Amen. Sure they're wonderful. Ladies, you may be seated. You know, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my lovely, devoted wife, Sister Sarah Thomas, for that lovely rendition of How I Got Over. - Leroy, wait a minute. Leroy... - The sermon for today... Shut up! ...is called "Sin and Lust." Amen! Amen! And there are derivatives, they're all from sin and lust! Amen! High blood pressure! - Tooth decay! - Amen. You get all these things when you sin and lust! I ain't got a cavity in my mouth! 'Cause I do not sin or do I lust! I must admit, Sister Sarah had one cavity, and that was from a childhood incident many years before she met me. But I cleansed her of her sin and her cavity filled itself. You know, I recall when my youngest junior here, Alfred, was young. It brings the laughter to my heart to think of it, because he used to pee on his brothers and sisters in the bed, when he was young, and he came to me and said, "Dad, is that sin?" I said, "No, you have not sinned "unless you do it on purpose." Yeah. Yeah. Now, his sister sinned, because she used to pee back on him. And I know God's gonna forgive them. Amen! Hmm. And that's why I talk about revenge. You see, "Revenge is mine, saith the Lord." He said that on many occasions. He said it east, west, north and south! He says it any time he get ready. 'Cause he know about that stuff. "And revenge is mine," saith the Lord. That means if you follow the Golden Rule, "Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you." Everything will be all right! Yeah! Remember, Beethoven wrote his first symphony when he was only five. All right, that's all for today. I'll see you next week. Do I have the honor of addressing Sister Sarah Thomas, who gives piano? Why, yes. Oh, you must be Althea's father. Praise the Lord! That ain't my father. My father's a handsome man. Althea. Charming child. I wasn't expecting anyone. You'll have to excuse this place. I don't believe I got your name. Charles Goodnight, Sister. Oh, Mr. Goodnight. These are lovely flowers. Thank you. I suppose you have a youngster you'd like to introduce to music? No, Sister Sarah, it's me. I've been made manager at the plant and I wanted to learn the finer things of life, and so here I am. Oh, I understand. You have discovered that the music of life is more than just one wild crescendo after another. You are now ready for the enrichment of a concert of culture. No, Sister Sarah, I'd like to learn how to play the piano. Oh. Well, when would you like to start? Right now. Well, I usually go home after 4:00. I'm so sorry. I can't wait to get my hands on those big, beautiful, black keys. Oh, I see you're quite anxious to start. Won't you sit down at the piano? Close to you. I beg your pardon? Close to You, that's the tune I'd like to learn how to play. Mr. Goodnight, are you sure all you came here to do was to learn how to play the piano? Sister Sarah, I have a confession to make. I've been watching you play music in the church now for two months, and it fills me with passion and desire I never thought possible in my whole life. It is as if heaven itself opens up and the angels dance out in a crescendo of naked bodies! Flesh on flesh, and their giant breasts clash together and their nipples throbbing! And there's a pulsating beat back and forth, in and out. And I have an orgasm of ear-sounding crashing. Mr. Goodnight, may I remind you that I am a married woman with six children and my husband is a minister of the church? What does that have to do with love, passion and desire? Mr. Goodnight, I think you'd better leave. Right now. I was afraid this would happen, Sister Sarah. I knew that if I exposed myself and opened my inner feelings, I would be nipped in the bud. And I only wanna learn how to play piano from the best. And I come to you, and you cut me off. Now, I have to go to Whitey. You missed your opportunity to train a virtuoso. Mr. Goodnight? Yes? Goodnight. Yes? I've decided to take you on. As a student. But you must promise me that you will confine your passions to the piano. When do I start? Wednesdays, 4:30. Sister Sarah, allow me. Mr. Goodnight. Thank you very much. You're very kind, but you're going to have to stop following me. What you got in here, sister? Just sit them in the back, please. Thank you, Mr. Goodnight. The only reason I'm here is the burning passion between a man and a woman cannot... Sister, your groceries. Sister? Mr. Goodnight. Now, a step up to the black keys is a halftone. White keys are separated by whole tones. Now, place your... Mr. Goodnight, please. Place your finger on middle C. Mr. Goodnight, will you please control yourself. Concentrate on the piano. Very good. Very good. You're making progress. You can learn a lot listening to records. This music is our heritage. Yes, that's some good music, ain't no doubt about it. You know, when I was a young girl, I used to dance all night. Once, in New York, before I met Lenox, I went to Small's Paradise, in Harlem, and, oh, I heard some good music that night. Oh, I haven't danced like this in years. Feels good, doesn't it? I knew you had the music in your soul, Sister Sarah. Mr. Goodnight, please. Sister Sarah, relax. Enjoy. Ah, isn't that lovely? That bubbly gets in me and it just makes me happy. Ah, Sister Sarah. Mmm! You move like a gazelle. Mr. Goodnight, please! Oh. Goddamn, baby. Mister... Get up! Control yourself. Don't fight the feeling! Get a hold of yourself! There's no use struggling, you haven't got a chance. Sister Sarah! You all right? Oh. I'll take it from here, Sister. Now, don't take another step. I must! I will! Now, look, you must control yourself. Please! You must control your feelings! I'm a man of passion. I can't control myself. Oh, help me. I'm so weak. Oh, God forgive me! I must have you! I want you, too. All right, I'm yours. I hope you're ready for me. I've been waiting for this for a long time. Uh, sister? I hope you got a strong back! Because my feelings for you are impassionate! Sister! Sister! Come on! Sister, could I have some water? I... What are you doing? Goodness gracious! Hmm. You know, you don't have to go. I do have to go. The Reverend won't be home. He'll be gone all night. He's probably out there giving some salvation to some poor soul. Huh. That's what you call it nowadays? Salvation? That's what he's doing? You know what he's doing, probably who he's doing it to. Well, yeah, I'm not a total fool. But until I met you, there was nothing I could do about it. But you're all the revenge I need. You sweet thing, you! I know the feeling, Sister Sarah. You're all the revenge I need. Why'd you say that? What do you mean? I mean, that the Right Reverend Lenox Thomas, your husband, fucked my wife and made her pregnant. And I fucked his wife, and I figure that makes me and the Reverend even. You made a fool out of me. With all your gifts and flowers and sweet talk. Nigger, do you know I will kill you now? It appears to be locked. Don't fall! Uh-uh. Come on, get up! Uh-oh. Come on, get up! Sister Sarah! Oh, my God, my lens! Yeah, your lens... I dropped my lens! Mmm-hmm. I'll be blind. Yeah, you gonna be blind. I can't... Uh-uh. Come on! Someone help! Help! I'll give you some help! Now you listen to me! My husband gave your wife a baby, well, you gonna give me a baby. Now, is that a deal? No! Is that a deal? Yeah, it's a deal! All right. Now take off them clothes. And get on your J-O-B. Can I turn out the light, dear? Oh, honey, it's all right. It happens to everybody sometime. Never happened to me before. You got a lot of stuff on your mind. You just need to relax, that's all. Just relax. What's that? Just my electric toothbrush, honey. Let me see. Here. Good night, honey. One more time, 21. - What you think you're gonna do? - Let's go. I'm going... I got my money. - Twenty-one, right here. Face up. - Oh, no. Hey, how long is it gonna take to fix this goddamn thing? Hey, Leroy. Hey, Leroy, don't rush the man. You know downtime is break time. Can you dig it? What do you say, brother? Yeah. I don't wanna mess up my quarter, you guys, you understand that? Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute I don't like to bust my ass, okay? Me, either. Mmm-hmm. I got my money. All right, gentlemen, I want you to move your ass, and I want you to do it now. Move! What the hell's wrong with him? Quit stalling, Mr. Goodnight. I only have 30 minutes before my next lesson. Did you get it up yet? I gotta have some help. Could you give me a hand? Are you kidding? I'll tell you what. I'll give you a little peek. Okay? Fine. Thank you. That's just what I needed to make it all better. Oh, my poor honey, you're gonna be late for work. Just hold this. Just... No, wait. I can't stay... Yes, you can. All right, hold it. Give me time... Gotta go. Gotta go. Where am I? In our house. You're all right. And that's my house? And then... And then I'll... And then... The doorbell, dear. It's tough at the top. I know, honey. Good morning. Good morning. Is he up yet? Yeah. I thought you might need a hand with him. Yeah, and it's getting worse. He's just stretching himself too thin. Come on, Leroy. I can't go on. Yes, you can. I gotta quit. Come on, brother, you're dreaming. Come on! You're dreaming, you're dreaming. Hey, hey! Come on, we're gonna go to work, man. You know we can't get anything done without you. Let's go! Okay. Come on. Goodbye, honey. Goodbye. Hey, Chuy, thank you, huh? You're welcome. Come on. Bye, honey. That ain't gonna work, man. That thing is dangerous. Can't you see that? Needs a guardrail. Somebody's gonna get chopped up. That machine don't work! It looks all right to me. I'll check it out! I'll see what I can do. But, please, go back to work, okay? Wait a minute, Leroy, Jose's right. You know where he comes from. You're a friend, man. Wait a minute. This is not about friendship. The friendship don't put money in my pocket, so get your asses back to work, please! Hey, look, man! Nobody's bullshitting you! This thing is dangerous. I'll tell you what's dangerous! It's dangerous for you to talk back to your boss. It's dangerous to your jobs! You don't care about us, man, or the Union! All you care about is your goddamn quota! Well, what about us? Get your asses back to work, or you're all fired! Then we'll sit down, Leroy! Remember that word, ese? Huelga! All right! Where you going? Upstairs. Which way is up, sucker? You forget who you are and where you came from? Sir? Sir, may I help you? Hey, wait a minute! Hey, you can't go up there! May I help you? Mr. Mann's office? Yes. Sir, you don't have an appointment! Excuse me. Should I call plant security, sir? No. How are you today, Mr. Jones? I have to talk to you. Why, of course. Come in. Please, have a seat. Art, Don, this is Mr. Jones. Who was a friend of Mr. Juarez, before he joined our management team. How can we help you, Leroy? I'm gonna transfer to Phoenix or Tampa, someplace. I got a lot of personal problems and I have to work 'em out. You know what I'm talking about? Of course I do. You can't go. What do you mean? I can quit if I want to. Yes, you could do that, or you could get... canned. Let me try and explain what I mean. You have no respect. No loyalty from your men. No love from your wife. One bastard across town, another on the way that doesn't even belong to you. Restore your honor. Make your men want to work for you. Be a man, boy! I need some time to work things out. I want to thank you for dropping by today. I've enjoyed our little chat so much. Excuse me. Have you had lunch? I'm not hungry. Well, here, finish this. No. Please, I insist. Eat it. I love to share. This tour will return to the spiritual side of the community after we have visited the Industrial Waste Recycling Plant. Agrico Industries produces 76 million... As you know, last year, the parishioners here, in the church, gave me this healing glove, that I might do the work of the Lord, because I have healing power. Now, I'll put my hand in my platinum healing glove. As you know, last week, a man came in with one leg shorter than the other and I healed him. Who will be first amongst you? I will. You will, brother? And what is your name? And what is your problem? Harold Washington. My feet. Harold Washington, your feet. What can I do for you and your feet, Harold? Make me whole again. Let me be quick and graceful! Let me dance and run... Harold! Harold! Harold, Harold, Harold! Snap out of it, Harold. You want an awful lot for $2, Harold. We can't do that today. But if you come back Christmas Eve, that's when we're healing. I'll be glad to do it. Here's your $2. You take a seat over there by the blind fellow. Thank you, Harold. Please move right along. All right, brother. Good, Harold. I'll get to you later. Uh, you will be easy. We'll get to you. Who will be next? I will! Praise the Lord. You, brother? You look mighty healthy to need healing. What can possibly be your problem? Well, my heart is troubled and my mind is weary. You're sick at heart, and your mind is troubling. Confess to the congregation. The Lord loves the truth. Amen. My wife slept with another man. Have mercy! Did you hear what he said? He said his wife has lain with another man. Now, what kind of low-life dog, scoundrel, snake in the grass, would lay with another man's wife? Who is this person? You, you lying son of a bitch! You're the one that slept with my wife. Oh, Lord, please forgive this man that has come into your church to blaspheme. His mind is filled with lunacy. Have mercy on his soul. Now, sit down, nigger, before I put this glove on your ass. You made love to my wife when she came over here for spiritual guidance. And all you laid on her was your Johnson. That's a lying sin. I know. Bring him out, Reverend. He's telling the truth! You have wronged this man and wronged me, too! I believe there's an attack of lunacy going around here that... Uh-uh. See, you been messing around outside and not taking care of business at home. Now, you done gave this man's wife a baby, huh? Well, I'm having a baby for him. An eye for an eye and a baby for a baby! You mean, that's not a tumor? Now, who else here done tasted the serpent's tongue? Me. Yeah, he slicked me! He slicked me. Nigger got me, too. And me, too. All them nights you was coming around to my house saying you was doing the work of the Lord and deceiving me! Ladies, you are my flowers! My bosoming blossoms that are going into life to fulfill my dream. You are carrying my seed forth. Break his face! - I'll do it. - Let me, too. Here, I'm gonna bite his legs off. Cut him down to size. It is the law of the... Next, we'll pass an important spiritual aspect of the community. Get him! Get him. Get him! Get him! Hey, look out, stupid! Holy shit! Oh, my... Stop the bus. Is he hurt? Is this part of the tour? Take it forward. I can't believe it. Oh, no. He's stuck to the wheel. My God! Flat as day-old beer! Sister Sarah. Excuse me. Yes? Is there anything I can do? I think you've done enough already. There must be something I can do. Yes. Fuck off. Leroy! Watch your fingers, honey. Leroy! I'm glad I found you. I'm glad I found you, too. I'm leaving. I just wanted to say goodbye. You're leaving? Yeah. Where you going? I got meetings in Delano and then we're going on to Salinas. Then we're going to San Francisco. There's work to be done in the Movement and I'm gonna do it. Wait a minute! I can't. I'm double parked. What do you mean, you're double parked? Why are you doing this? Because when I made a commitment to you, I did it because I expected some responsibility, some trust, some honor from you! And you made me a promise and you broke it. Wait a minute, baby. My pride and my honor were involved. What pride? What honor are you talking about? You got no respect from your friends. You don't have any friends. You have used people and you have been used, and you're too dumb to even know it, Leroy. I can change, Vanetta. Goodbye, Leroy! What about the baby? We'll be taken care of. Chuy! Hope you get your life together, Leroy! Or something! Chuy! God damn you, Chuy! No, don't do this! I can change, Vanetta! Annie Mae! Annie Mae! Annie Mae! Annie Mae, look, we're both headed in the same direction. No, we're not. I'm going my way and you're going yours. You gotta find out what it takes to be a man, Leroy. I can't help you with that. Annie Mae, there's a lot of things, see, and I'm putting them together. And... Leroy... Goodbye. Annie Mae! I know there's something, see? The things that happen in your life. I'm saying that it don't have to be this way. You gotta understand that I know. I want you to know that I loved you! I loved you, Annie Mae! Annie Mae! Been watching me, Mr. Mann? Just dropped by to see how you were handling yourself, Leroy. I see you've done your usual incompetent job. You hired the wrong nigger for this job. And you're gonna have to explain that to somebody, 'cause I just quit! Get my drift, boy? Now, here's the keys to your house and your goddamn car. Did you get that down? I'm at the bottom of my life, Mr. Mann, and the only way for me is up! Now, if you don't like that, you better shoot me in my ass right now, 'cause that's the last part you ever gonna see of me, motherfucker!
