Stop it. Eat. I can't. What is it? Thinking about that again? I have to. What will we do if there's no job? Stop whining for once, for God's sake! Be a man! He'll eat. Don't shout! Hey, I'm asking you friendly, what do you lack today? There's bread, there's meat, we don't work. What more do you want? Come on, take it. Take it. That's it. Gavrilo is a doctor for you. Heals you immediately. He sweet-talks a lot. What is he by origin? Don't say. Say it. Speak freely. Don't! - Say it, old man. - You see he knows. Just try to say... - Just say... - Hey, Gaša, not by the neck. - He bit me. - Let me see. - It's nothing, just for an earring. - What earring?! They don't know whose you are! They brought you in a sack! Hey... Are you alone? I guess you see. Going to the market, huh? Nah. To see a doctor? No. They grow peas on sticks here. So where are you going? Why should I tell you? Where are you going? Well... for employment. I'll work in Belgrade. And them? We're together. They want to stay. But me... ...until I earn enough for a horse. How far are you going? - To Belgrade. - Belgrade. To a factory? I don't know. I don't know, bro. I don't think about that. It's a long way to Belgrade. Anyway, you go there. Is it difficult to find a job? Well, not if you have someone. If you go to the employment office, you'll get a construction job. 1000 bricks a day, 50 carts of mortar. I'm looking for a decent job, a qualified one. And where do you sleep? Wherever you are. - Where will we be? - In the barracks. If you get it. They offered it to me. But I want an apartment. I'll build a house with someone. - Really? - A floor for each. Well... if we knew each other better, we could build together. You and them. I'm going back to the village. Do they have money? Well... they will have. And what's your name? - Đorđe. - Đorđe... I know you from somewhere. - Like you were already on... - On the train. Yes. Eh, I left the village a long time ago. And I'm still traveling. Old Man... Hey... your friend is calling. What are you talking about?! Nothing special. Is that one up there? He is. Do you have an umbrella? I have many things. You want to see? Here... Here, look. Go away! Beat it! Why drive him away? He's a peasant. His eyes shine like a dog's. - He's honest. - He was once. Now he hangs out in trains. Hey... Take it. Take it. Free. To remember me. Are you sure this is the house? - I'm not sure. There were two barrels in front of the house. - When? - Well, three years ago. - Where's the light? Here it is. That's his door. It says on the plate. Let's ring, huh? Knock, Old Man. Knock harder, for God's sake. Call him. - Mileta. Mileta! Cousin! - Maybe he's not home. - Let's wait for him outside. - Come on. Which one is his window? This one here. - The third. - You can't see anything. My legs hurt. - Let's sit down. - Come on. Hey, there's someone here. - Down here. - He's here! Cousin! Mileta! Mileta... open up. Knock harder. Cousin! It was open. You go in first. Come on. Come on, Kid. Mileta... Cousin... What's wrong? Old Man, help us get him to bed. - Come on. - Careful. He's sick. - It's all wet. - Give him my shirt. - He's drunk, huh? - Quiet. - Who is it? - It's us. - Who are you? - Radovan, Gaša and me, Jeremija. Peasants? We are. We came to see you. Water... water... Here it is. He covered himself from the flies. Let's eat. Come on. Don't let them there! No one here. Go to the main gate. Call the watchman. Bring two blankets and a brazier to cook polenta. What is it? Eh... Here... What's in there? The slaughterhouse. Yeah. So that's where they slaughter them. When will it be? The dawn? Another hour or two. It's going to rain. Do they need a worker here? I don't know. Try... tomorrow. I have this. I was going to go there. What is that? I took it from one of the sacks. - Beočin, factory. - Let me see. Ah, cement. You'll swallow dust. Let me sleep here tonight. I don't know you. - Should I trust you right away? - Radoje, get rid of him! Get by somehow. - Where are your things? - There. So, put them in your hands... the road under your feet, and march to the village while there's time! Get lost, I can't look at you. Come on. We're not asking to stay with you. We'll find a place to stay. By the way... Do you know any job for us? Please. - A job? - Yeah. - A job? - A job. And where are your qualifications? Here, look. We brought food. Do you want to smoke some tobacco? - Hey. - Here, it's cooked. Should we beg him? He will. Come on, go! Come on. Hey, what are you doing? Drowning them? Maybe you should. They do damage. We don't drown them. - Who are... you? - There in our village. We take them far away, to wander. You should take them too. You'll get your hand wet this way. Listen, Kid... Did I ask you anything? Come here. Come... - So, take them. - Where? - Take them! - I could, but I don't know the area. I'm afraid I'll get lost. - And how did you find me, huh? - We wandered. If someone took us back to the city, we would all be lost. - Really? - Sure. Where are you taking us? We've been walking two hours. Sit there and wait. I'm going to see about a job for you. I'll be back in an hour. - Alright, bye. - Bye. We'll get caught in the rain. What would you like to do? Do you think about that? I think, Jeremija, I think. - Let's go. - Where? We have to wait for Mileta. He'll never return. I know why he dragged us here and left us. Come on, we'll find a job by ourselves. Let's go. CITY EMPLOYMENT OFFICE You worked in a factory before? In Raška, two years ago. Come in a week. Wait... Where do we go until then? Hello? Alright, I'll send them. Just you... two at most. - Now what? - I'll ask him now. Will you pay for our accommodation? Why me? Go home and wait. Do you have land? I don't. - And you two? - They don't. This one has something... but this one has neither father nor mother. Then you two, come next week. It's good, Gavrilo, huh? There's no job for me? So when the harvest comes, you run away? You don't care about the factory. - Let's go. - Good bye. Hey, new guy... catch that calf. What are you waiting for? - I know the way from here. - Where is it? - Right this way. - Come on. Wait, stop. Kid, go buy bread. Where you ate before. Go on. Two kilos, Gavrilo! OK. C'mon. Will he take us? You'll beg him. Good evening. Good evening. We came... for our things. Take them. That's my wife. Good evening. And... if we could sleep here. We have nowhere to go. - Cousin... - "Cousin"... And what if I wasn't your cousin? What's with him? Here, answer me that! OK, Mileta... What's the matter, Mileta? You mistook both the apartment and the man. - Take it! - No, we didn't, because you have cats in front of the house. And I know you by the shirt we put on you last night when you were sick. Dara... Dara! Wait, Dara! You are, you are! - Get away! - Mileta, what's with you? Dara, stop! They're leaving now. Dara! Are you hurt, Gavrilo? Nothing, nothing, it's fine. - It's fine. - Mileta... We're not asking you to hire us! The two of us need to report to the factory. Wait! He's going too. He's going. - What do we do now? - I don't know. - Let's go to bed. - So let's go to bed. Gavrilo, help. Hey... Now I'm... him. Huh? It's for the mosquitoes. There's a small airport behind the factory. How do you know? I was there. I visited all Belgrade in two months. And where is it best? Where there are female children. Gavrilo... Come here. We'll enroll in this course. - ADULT EDUCATION - No, I'm not adult. What are you going to do? Stare at planes? To work. Could this stay with you for a few days? Give it here. Thank you. Today we will talk about occupational hygiene. Occupational hygiene is a relatively young branch of science. It applies... Yes? I'd like to leave. I have to go now. Go on. Therefore, occupational hygiene has been applied only in recent times. You lasted eight minutes. Here's your tie. Does it suit me? Look. Well... Fine, just take your hat off. Wait, not like that. Comb your hair left or right. - Where do you live? - At the dormitory. Come on, we'll be late. Here it is, I brought you. I've been preparing to approach a girl for a long time. But she is always has company. A while ago it was convenient, she sat alone. Where? It doesn't matter. Eh... When I approach her, don't look at me because the whole thing will fail. Turn away. Number? Which one? Do you want your coat? No, I just happen to be here. Not there, please, you're blocking my light. Such a big hallway and you have to walk there. How am I bothering you? You stomp with those shoes like they're made of wood. What? Do you want half? Here you go. Just don't stomp with those shoes. Sit in that chair and read. So, did you have fun? It seems. And... you work here? Not always. I'm replacing my mom. You want half? Here you go. I won't give you anything more. - What's your name? - Snežana. - You poured brandy here? - Rum. - Snežana... I like you. - What? - I like you. - Know when you'll have a girlfriend? - When? - Never. Now everyone will rush. Kid, come help me. What is it? We'll hand out coats. To whom? To whom? Don't you hear "Gina"? They always play that song at the end. The dance is over. ...and I'm at the Academy of Fine Arts in the morning. - You know where it is? - No. What do you do there? I'm drawn by the students. It's not difficult. You just sit, keep quiet and you can't move. Here it is, I'm going. - Hey, you know I... - I know, you want to see me again. I promise nothing. If you really care, stop by for a matinee. Ah, Gavrilo... - You came, huh? No electricity yet? - No. Why are you standing outside? - Mileta. - What about Mileta? He came back and drove me away. Hold the candle. Put it all out. Here's the bag. And this. Take care. Jeremija! Oh, Jeremija! - What is it? - There you are. Look. Where are you going with that? He's back... with his wife. What will we do now? You and I here, at the construction site. Gavrilo is already gone. He went to one of his friends. Who is his friend? From the factory. They live in some kind of dormitory. Who will turn off the light? Do you get up at night to pee? - Nope. - If you do, don't wake her up but count the ninth door on the left in the hallway. I will. Oh really. Nah... Kiss me. Not like that. Wait. Let's get out of here. Come in. - It's dark. - They cut off the electricity. There's a candle in the window. Go and light it. - Don't come here. - Why? Just because. You live here, huh? We used to. Mom got an apartment. And this? It'll be torn down. High-rises are coming here. Eh... when will they tear it down? Who knows? And no one lives here anymore? Now we do. - And who are we? - You and I. I'm asking seriously. You're always asking something, you spotted monster. Hey... Kiss me. Kiss me. If you stay that way, your neck will stiffen. What is it? Are you afraid? No... Come. Come... And... and the candle? We went to the beach. It's not exactly beach season. It isn't, but she wanted to. And then you're on the sand, huh? No, we went to her room later. - Wow. - Look at him, in the room! And what? I won't tell you any more! Hey... What kind of legs does she have? Fat or skinny? - Crooked, huh? - Does she wear negligee? Shh, silence. Does she walk around the room with nothing on? Cut the crap! Snežana doesn't undress like that. That's your girl, Snežana? Snežana the coat-check girl? Does she call you... my little... spotted monster? Kiss me! Kiss me! Snežana! Snežana! Hey, are you looking for Snežana? - She no longer works at the Academy. No point shouting. - Who are you? We used to work together. She left. She's there, she's there. I'll find her. - They made fun of me, so I fought. - OK, OK. - Is it, Kid... - What? You're sure it's empty there? Yes. My girlfriend lived there before with her mother, then they got an apartment and moved out. Eh... You should go to the dormitory once and beat them up. I will, I will. Come on, show me the way. Here it is. But there's no electricity. Doesn't matter, we'll take it easy. Only if it's empty. I'm telling you, no one lives there. - Old Man, are you coming? - I'm coming. It's locked! I know where the key is. I'll just peek. I have to go to the construction site now. - Well, nobody kicked us out of here. - And they won't. We get up very early. Blessed is Jeremija. He'll sleep now. Hey! Boy! Come back. Did you forget me? I'm the one from the train. The one you kicked me out of. How is the Old Man? What's he doing? I remember I gave him a comb. I wanted to give one to you too but... You were up above. - I remember. How are you? - Did you manage? - Are you together? - We are. We live here. Yeah. And where do you work? Tell me about the Old Man. He's a night watchman at the construction site. Yeah. And you and this tall one? - We're at the factory. - Gavrilo! You look like you're not happy about it. - C'mon! - Neither was I. Well, alright. I'm hurrying to work. Shall we build a house together? - Bye! - Hurry up! We'll be late! - It's that guy from the train. - I know. Old man... open up. Guess who came to visit? Đorđe, the one from the train. Old man, open up. Well, are you the one from when we traveled? That was supposed to be for three. I haven't eaten in a long time. And I'm famished. Where did you come from? From Beočin. I tried there. And? You couldn't, huh? - I'm going to drink water, I'm thirsty. - Go on, go on. Hey! And how did you find us? I met the Kid this morning when they went to work. Listen... go to my company. They'll probably take you too. There behind those high-rises. Ask about the company "Roof". Is it sure? Hurry... while the manager is there. Thank you! I'm not asking to stay with you. Just like that... to let someone like you help me. Hey! Stop! Come to sleep! Stay as long as you like! The conical thread of each gear that is processed parallel... You're studying? - The conical thread of each gear that is processed parallel... - Hey! I bought it. I'm going to town for a bit, it's been a long time. - I'm going too! - You can't. - Sit there. - Try them. - Yeah. Thanks, Old Man. Is it OK? - They're good. - I'm going with you too. I have to stop by Mileta. Our bags were left with him. Study! What is your name? I love little kids. I thought that you wouldn't even come back... from your, what's it called, Beočin. And that you forgot your things. Your suitcase got moldy. I had to put it out in the sun. How many places did you leave it like this? Good thing you still remember where it is. - So you found a steady job? - Yeah. Masonry. I make good money. And where do you live? With friends. They gave me a room. A big one. - Remember what you promised me? - Hm? You said... when I get a job, when I find an apartment... when I get nice clothes... What? I don't know. You said you'd find me someone... to marry. - I didn't promise that. - You did. Yes, you said it. Well, maybe I did. I don't know. You looked unhappy. I wanted to comfort you. I work. Here, look at my hands. Look. Listen... Get up, get up. Open the window. Right away. Stand there, facing the yard. There's a girl across the yard. I'll show you. Why should she look at me like that? Let her come here. Stay there and don't move. How should I look? Well, look... solid and confident. - What is this? - I don't know. What are you doing, hell! I'm getting married. I have to. She needs a house. She was abandoned twice. Who did you ask to partition? You weren't using this room anyway. I'll get her on Saturday. With your permission. Don't bring anyone there. Do you hear! Get out! Old Man... set the table to eat. You and Gaša brought him. Now let him stay with you. I'll move out anyway. I'm moving out! As soon as winter passes. The woman and I will only spend the winter here. Can it be like that? Where is Gavrilo? My wife will cook for you too. She'll clean both homes. She'll look after the Kid like her own son. See my tooth. Huh? I got a new one. Silver. Look. - That's enough! - Don't. Don't. It's all lies. Shut up there, do you hear! I'm moving. We've been together long enough. Stop. If we need, we'll kick this one out. - Here, I'll do it now. - Stop, Old Man! Stop. I'm going... and that's it. I decided long ago... to move out... as soon as I finish the course. Watch Gavrilo. I won't go to the cinema. I'm not in the mood. As you like. It is your own fault. Hey! Look there. - Where? - There by the pole. - Snežana. - Call her. - Call her! - She won't go with me. Invent something, persuade her. She'll agree. - She won't. There are reasons. - Then go to... Stop. How about you approach her without me and I'll slip in after? How about it? If she wants. Cat... Đorđe... Đorđe... Open up. Open up, hey! What is it? Let me tell you what happened with Snežana. It's not my business, go! - It's over with her! - Get your leg out. - No! - Get your leg out! - No! - Get your leg out... Rat! Skinny rat! What happened? Good evening. What is it? Why are you sitting here? Why are you looking at me? Don't stare at me! You're crying. Who insulted you, Gavrilo? Are you sick? Shut up, shut up! I can't listen to you anymore! I can't, I can't! This one's wife didn't come. And he took out a loan for the furniture. Where's your wife, huh? She won't come to you and you took out a loan for the furniture. And why won't she won't come? Because he looks like a skinny rat. Tell him that. Tell him! Tell him so he hears. - Tell him! - You look like a skinny rat! Poor one, what have you done? Tell him. Eh, poor one, what have you done? C'mon now, sing. Sing. Freely. I don't want to. - Sing to him, don't be angry. - What should I sing? "My Wife". C'mon, Gavrilo. C'mon. My wife and four kids And four kids When I die who will support you? I can't, I feel sick. Well... we didn't have anything to do. Don't be angry. You want a cake? What is it? Let her out. I want to tell her something. What do you want? It's for you, get out. And let him stay. Come on, kid, get out of here! You shut up! And you come here. I've known you longer than him. I have nothing to do with you. Well... do you... do you see those geese? Do you see them flying? They all look at each other's asses. Just like you look at mine. Leave him. He'll stand there until tomorrow. Let's go. You wait... I'll catch you. Snežana... Snežana! Let's go to the cinema. I'll give your apartment back too! Do you hear? Snežana! You know... You know, you won't... You won't meet here anymore either! Đorđe... Đorđe... Hey, Gavrilo... - Come out. - I can't now. Come out, I'm alone. But I'm not alone. - She came... - Who? My wife. Don't, don't, don't... I'll call you... another time. While I'm getting ready. Reksi! Reksi! Hey... What is it? I was just passing by, so I stopped. So pass by. Why are you standing? You see I'm thinking! You crawled in there like a sick dog. - Get out! - I won't. - Get out or I'll beat you! That's enough already! Get out! - You see you're... - Get away! Gavrilo! Stop! - Ah, it's you. - It's me. - Hello. - Come in. - I barely found you. All the houses and streets are the same where you live. - How are you, Old Man? - Eh... So-so. Sit down. Don't get mad, I have to. The exam's tomorrow. OK, OK. Why don't you visit us? Not once. There's no time, you see. Yes, yes... So, I came because of Gavrilo. You hear, Radovan? Because of Gavrilo. I hear, I hear. He’s getting worse and worse every day. Does he come to the factory? I guess he comes, I don't know. Someone should influence him. I'll come one day to slap him and everything will be fine. And now, please don't talk for a bit. - I have to do this... - OK, OK. Look, the Sava (river). - Old Man, please... - OK. So... well... I'm going, Radovan. I'm going. - Yes... - What can I do here? Bye, Old Man. - Bye. - Bye. - Visit us sometime. I will, don't worry. Bye. Đorđe... My friends are gone, so I thought... Đorđe knew where they were. Jeremija left... early this morning. He went to look for Gavrilo. He wasn't home for long. Never mind, then. Today is Sunday, so I thought I'd visit them. You can wait for them here. Take a seat. Never mind. I'll go there. I'll sit with you. It's cold and dirty there. Please. Here. Take a seat. I'm Radovan. My friends told you? I hear you got a new apartment. A room. Did you pass that other course? Yes, I did somehow. A new coat? New. Crombie? Crombie. - Why don't you take it off? - I'm used to it. And it won't crease. There's a picture of you at Jeremija's. You bought a new machine. Borrowed. Now you certainly have a better salary. A little more as a qualified worker. On construction jobs they pay poorly. - Should I make coffee? - No need. Where is Jeremija? He's coming. You again? I told you, the man isn't here! He is there! You hide him with her! Come on, you're drunk. I told you, come in the morning to look for him. You're lying!! I know! Let me in! C'mon, go away. Hey, where are you going? Stop! Stop, come back! - C'mon. Get out when I tell you. - I won't... - He kidnapped my wife! - Get out! - I won't! - Let's see if you won't! - Let me go! - Ljuban, over here! - You're hiding them! - Get out! - Hold him, he won't get out! - And why won't you, huh? - Get out! - I won't! - March out when I tell you! - I won't! Get him out! Take it and get out! You know? She went with Radovan. Đorđe... Lie down. You knew about the two of them. You knew when they started. - I didn't. - You did. - You helped them meet. - I didn't. You were against me. I wasn't. - You're lying! - I'm not lying! - You're lying! - I'm not! - You're against me. - I'm not. - You knew everything. But what is she worth to him! She can't give birth! She can't give birth! She can't, she can't, she can't... She can't! Hey, Snežana... What do you want now? Snežana! You again? Come on, Kid. Get out of here when I tell you. Go away! I see you'll get a razor shave haircut. Stevo! Hold him! Get him inside! What are you playing, buddy? It has no name. I play for the house I moved out of. And what do you play about? About how my daughter was born there... how my wife got over a disease. I say goodbye to my house. They're tearing it down. They're building a new settlement. Do you want tobacco? Do you have any words for that? Nope. They're tearing down... They're tearing down. And Jeremija went home? He did. What will we do now? Build a new house? You mean, a floor for you, a floor for me. And will you...? What? I know a place. It's good. What is it good for? For everything, man. - Let it go. - We should've gone there right away. What if we fail there too, we move again? Let's try. Let's try, do you agree? - They have to take us when they see... - See what? - When they see... - What strong guys we are, right? Well, they'll be very happy. Strong guy, strong guy... Look at yourself. You look like a skinny rat. Stop it. - No wonder your wife left you. - Stop it! - Rat! - Shut up, you piece of shit! Who's a piece of shit?! You'll see now! I'll give it to you now! And who did that to you? And who did this to you? - Where to? - To Priboj on the Lim river. - You have cigars? - I do. If need be, I can buy others. - I smoke everything. Come in. - Where to? - I'll go to Užice, then you'll find another. - Yeah, yeah. Gavrilo, c'mon! C'mon, hurry up! C'mon, c'mon, come here. C'mon. Close it. Are you on business? We're moving to another city to live. What's this? A machine. - Typewriter? - No, sewing machine. Want to buy it? Did you steal it? Nope. I have a receipt. Here, take a look. And this is all of your things? Everything. You two are really strong guys. The End subtitles by djvaso at KG proofreading by vertovfan at KG
