♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh... ♪ [Catalina] Right. Here's you go. Number 53. Your Chicharron dumplings with sweet prune dipping sauce, and your garlic and shrimp arepas. [sizzling] And for my favorite agent, here's the special. What's up, Dee? The publisher called to say the L.A. Cookbook is selling like crazy, and they've approved your concept for the follow up. - Amazing. - But... They want to see the first chapter before they commit. - Okay. - Luckily... The perfect one has fallen right into our lap. - What? Where? - Ireland. A family of royals read about you and they've invited you to come and cook for them for a week. Shut up. Okay... um, when? They want you there tomorrow. - Wait a sec, tomorrow? - Tomorrow. - Okay, um... - Oh, one more thing. On your final day there, they've asked you to prepare a royal banquet. - I don't know what that is. - Google it. - Right. Thanks, Dee. Yeah. - Thanks for lunch. - Hi. What can I get you? - Hey. Can I have... [instrumental music] [sheep bleating] [Cillian] You never been to Ireland before? [Catalina] No, first time. But I am always up for a new adventure. [Cillian] Well, I'm sure you'll love it here. [Catalina] I mean, it's like... I've never seen the color green before. I take it you've never been to what we call a big house then? Nothing over three bedrooms. [music continues] [Cillian] Well, this place has twelve. Oh! I wanna get a place with my fella. But he lives and works here, and it can be a hard place to leave. Hmm. Yeah, I can see why. [man vocalization] - Oh, my God. - [Cillian] You get used to it. [Catalina] Really? [Cillian] No. [Catalina chuckles] I've got to pick up Lord Perry's shirts from the dry cleaners. Extra starch. - Be all right? - Uh-huh. [car door shuts] [engine revving] [knock on door] - Hello, how may I help you? - Hi. I made it. It's a long trip, but I-I'm finally here. - You are? - Catalina. - I'm going to need more. - Gonzalez. - I-I'm here to... - [Rory] Ah! You're not the first of Lord James's girlfriends to show up on our doorstep, you won't be the last. And they usually use the side entrance. - Okay. - Oh, I'm... Okay! I'm not anybody's girlfriend. Hold on, please. All right. You said please, but I'm getting the feeling you didn't mean it. [sighs] [instrumental music] [birds chirp] [sighs] It's you. It's you. Now that that's settled, I'll be going. - Oh, I'm not his girlfriend. - I use the term loosely. - What are you doing here? - I live here. But you said your name was Hawk. Right, here you go. Enjoy. All right, what do you got for me? - You ready? - Yeah. So... this is an arepa with sauteed jackfruit, caramelized onion and jalapeño awaze. Okay, I use some of those words. But I like the way you say them. Mm. And this... is my Baraka taco. Named after the woman who taught me how to use the ingredients. So you have Gomen... roasted potatoes and ayib. A plant based cheese sauce. Oh, my God, you're a magician. I'm gonna need to know more about the person who can do this, come for a drink with me. - I don't think so. No. - No? I'm taking a break from your type. My type? I don't think I'm a type. - You're a type. - Really? Hmm, cute accent, straight out of a boy band. Ah, it's a pretty good stereotype, actually. Well, being named after an animal is your third strike. I've dated two colts and a wolf. Hawk's a nickname. Yeah, your... real name is, uh... Lord Covington, the 12th Marquess of Cornworthy. Yeah, look, I don't intend to introduce myself that way because it's kind of a tongue twister. And people make assumptions. Okay, um... So what am I really doing here? Come inside and I'll explain. Come on, you came all this way. [chuckles] [instrumental music] Please? [Catalina] Tsk. [birds chirp] Only because you said it that way. And you should really give your bouncer some tips. Well... Welcome to Ravenswood Castle. Okay. Nice stuff. I bet you guys didn't build these yourself. Is he gonna stand there the whole time? Oh, that's Rory. He runs the house. - Like a butler? - Not like a butler. - No. - No, more like a house manager. Hmm. Could you get Cat a glass of water, please, Rory? - Will she be staying that long? - Make a tequila. We don't have tequila. Right, what about a whiskey then? Thank you, Rory. Hmm? Okay. Start talking. I hired you because you're an amazing chef. Not because of what happened between us. This is a one night thing, got it? There will be no cuddling in the morning. - Because you won't be here. - If that's what you want. ♪ Don't you wanna see me flaunt ♪ I'm gonna give you a fake name and an eight digit phone number. I won't even try to call. [chuckles] ♪ Don't you ♪ Don't you wanna ♪ Don't you ♪ Don't you wanna see me flaunt what I got? ♪ In America, we call that a hook up. That's what we call it here, too. [scoffs] We were very clear with each other that night about our intentions. Absolutely crystal. And that's why I made the request through your agent. This is a purely professional thing. This way. Okay, but, I didn't know that you were the one who hiring me. I take my job really seriously. And I don't sleep with men to get work. - [Catalina] Don't. - Wo... [glass clinks] [sighs] All right, um... As excited as I was about this idea... I don't think it's a good one. I'm leaving. Well, sorry to see you go so soon. Where is that adorable apple faced man with the car? Cillian? Cillian will be back in a few. Will you hear me out in the meantime, please? Okay, so here's what's going on. My grandmother is coming to visit from London this week because property developers have offered to buy this house. So she's going to decide whether to sell or not. My father and I need to show her that we're managing the estate well, and we are happy here. Because she'd love to find an excuse to have us move back to London, be closer to her. Okay. So you have an overbearing abuela. I get that. What does that have to do with me? I want to show how we can take what can be crusty family traditions into the future. To create a more modern version of a big house. I'd like to show them what they've been missing living behind the castle walls. The real and vibrant tastes and experiences of the real world. In other words, you. And my agent explained about the cookbook? Yes. I think it's a brilliant idea. A lot of these big houses are owned by British families like ours. And to the locals, we can seem mysterious and misunderstood, to say the least. And, your family is in agreement about this? Well... Do they even know I'm here? Um... I didn't want to give them the chance to reject the idea in advance. But they're going to find you as refreshing and effervescent as I do. Your charm doesn't work on me. I did that one time. That was my charm working on you. Your smile alone is going to melt away their defenses. And this is going to work. And then you've got to give an amazing first chapter for your cookbook. Do we have a deal? I don't have to call you Lord, do I? - Only if it feels right. - It doesn't. Okay... I'll just get this, shall I? I'm back. I... see that. It seems like I will be here for a little bit, so... You might wanna get used to this face. Mm... - Can I have a word, please? - Yeah. One minute. [door creaking] Why would you hire some young woman who knows nothing about Anglo Irish traditions, never mind royal protocols to cook for such a big occasion. Our home is on the line, our lives here, my job. Look, you need to lighten up, don't be such a dryshite. You need to be more of a dryshite, James. You're supposed to be showing off your maturity and your good judgment this week. And your first move is to hire some American with her ponytail, her-her-her, her denim jacket. Come on. Yeah, well, hopefully, she'll stir things up a bit. We won't be bored to tears this week. We don't need anybody stirring the pot. We need a nice still pot of a warm, comfy stew. Like the kind Mrs. O'Donnell makes. - What's she gonna make of this? - Well, I gave her the week off. - You did the job. - Yeah. But Finn will be here to help out. Right. Well, can't wait to see how that works out. [door opens] Thanks. [door creaking] Everything okay? - Yeah. - No. Rory's gonna give you a tour of the house. And he's gonna show you to your room. In the staff quarters. No-no, I'll put her in the Ballyknocken Suite. That is reserved for people above a certain title. Oh, I competed in a beauty pageant when I was a kid. I was crowned Guajillo Chili Queen. You see? Show the queen around. - Right this way, Your Majesty. - Mmm! After you... dryshite. [Catalina chuckles] [Ror-Holy Jesus! ave Mary and Joseph. [Catalina blows raspberry] No... just me. Sorry to intrude, Lord Perry, I didn't know you were in here. [Perry] Wait a minute. Oh, this... this, this is Ms. Catalina Gonzalezes. Of the East L.A. Gonzalezes. - It is so nice to meet you. - No, no, don't! I am going to make sure you and your family have a bunch of incredible meals this week. And an all around great time. 'Cause it's kind of my jam. Bringing people together through food. And we're done. Okay. Oh. You're not used to interacting with the normals. Who are the normals? - And, who is this woman? - You can call me Cat. She'll be serving as our head chef this week. During mother's visit? What about Mrs. O'Donnell? - James sent her on holiday. - Ah. [Perry] There's a lot riding on this week, Rory. I expect you will supervise Ms. Gonzalez. And keep Lord James in line during mother's visit so there are no, um... embarrassing incidents. Thank you, Rory. I don't know what I'd do without you. And this is... obviously the kitchen. Oh, my God. This is my favorite room in the house. But I did not expect this in a castle. This has to be a recent renovation, right? I mean, a progressive country kitchen... with a Belfast sink. Ah! I can work with this. Well, if you're done fondling the workspace, we can move on. The one dish that is a requirement for the royal banquet is a shepherd's pie. I know the basics. I think I can elevate it in an interesting way. Uh... i-i-it's not meant to be interesting. It's meant to be a shepherd's pie. The recipe is in here. [chuckles] - Anyone can follow a recipe. - Including you. I... like to be creative. I think of myself as an artist. But you're here to do a job. - Like a butler? - Like a cook. But we already have a chef. I heard the interloper had arrived. Oh. I'm the interloper? This is Finn, the house sous chef. Who wants to be head chef. Got it. She'd only be here the week, really. Let's see. This way. Oh, everyone's just so happy here. We have two days to prepare before The Duchess arrives. Now, you can shop for what you need at the farmer's market and we'll have afternoon tea upon the lady's arrival. Do you know what that entails? - No. But I'm a quick study. - Well, good. I'm gonna have to teach you everything. James can be a bit unfocused when it comes to follow through. Hey. We can get through this without killing each other, right? - I'll keep the knives locked up. - Wow. Your sense of humor is really the just add water type, huh? The Duchess is a stickler for tradition. And can be hard to please. Plus, she is English. So, double that. I've dealt with difficult customers before. [chuckles] Following the afternoon tea on day one, day two will include an Irish breakfast before a day of leisure. Day three, light hors d'oeuvres in the ballroom, accompanied by a string quartet. Just a few guests, and a bit of fun for The Duchess. Day four, the royal banquet, also in the ballroom. [door creaking] The Ballyknocken Suite. [chuckles] Is this where people with fancy titles do their ballyknocken? Come on. Fess up. Isn't part of the fun of working at a place like this getting a peek behind the curtain? Absolutely not. A bed like this does make you feel powerful. You know? Like you can do anything. We don't do that here. Oh, but you can't tell the Guajillo Chili Queen what to do. Come on. I order you to try it. I... No! Please. The bed has just been made. The springs are 1,000 years old. Please stop. - Come on. - Come on. - Please. - Ooh! Ooh! People are going to think we're doing it. [Rory scoffs] [bed squeaking] Come on, it's harmless. - Immature. - Innocent fun! You are missing out on the freedom of being royal. - Or a kid. - Of which we are neither. So... [chuckles] [gasps] There it is. A smile. [laughs] I guess you do remember joy. Your childhood wasn't miserable after all. Hey, what did I say? [engine revving] [thud] [sighs] I'm so sorry, Lord Perry. I wasn't expecting her, I would have been out here had I known. - [Cillian] But... - But what, Cillian? But nothing, M'lady. [Edwina] I decided to come a bit early. I hope I'm not intruding. But how could I be? Since The Duke and I are the rightful owners of this place. Perhaps you could straighten it out a smidge. Yes, Ma'am. Hello, mummy. Dear boy. You look thin. Our doors will, of course, open to you anytime. But I can guess the real reason you chose to surprise us... Because I wanted to see you and James, why else? You're hoping to catch us mishandling the estates? So you can force us back to England to move in with you. Would that be such an awful thing? Your wife has been gone a year now. I worry about you boys all on your own. We're fine. Besides... not sure how father would feel about us all under one roof. [Edwina] Sends his regrets. Polo match. I'll never understand the boys and their sticks. As far as you and James go, I can't force you to do anything. No, you're much too manipulative and conniving for that. Don't you forget it. You're a chip off this old block. [birds chirp] This doesn't mean you're off the hook for your recent scandalous behavior. We're going to discuss it at some point. Of course we are. I've already talked to James about it. And so you know... the house is running like a clock. I'm sure you're most likely responsible for that. - How are you, Rory? - Very well, Lady Edwina. And who is this exotic creature? That's racist adjacent? - I'm Cat. - Ms. Catalina Gonzalez. No title. It's real... You're joking. Down you go, down you go. - Down you go. - Hello. Okay. It's a pleasure. [birds chirp] It's really good for the quads, huh? I didn't invent the peerage system, but what can I say? - I don't mind being bowed to. - Yeah, it must be nice. You have to be born to it, dear. Luck of the draw, huh? Ms. Gonzalez will be serving as the house chef this week. Ah! Luck of the draw! Actually, a lot of hard work and talent. We'll be the judge of that. And I'm planning on impressing you. Well, that's the hope. Some fresh energy. And we have Mrs. O'Donnell's recipes to hand, of course. I won't miss that battle axe. After she had the nerve to flirt with my husband, she's lucky she's not in the garden pushing up daisies. [chuckles softly] Right. Lady Edwina. Thank you, dear boy. - How are you? - Well! Right, look, I know everything's in bits here, but we've gotta give it a lash jack, right? I need yous to up to 90. And there needs to be no messin' around. All right? No-no givin' out or I'm gonna eat the head off yous, right? [scoffs] What is wrong with him? He gets more Irish when he's stressing out. [Catalina] Yeah, is he yelling at us or giving us a pep talk? - Both. - Oh. We have less than two hours to put together an afternoon tea fit for The Duchess. Now, I'll take care of the tablecloths the silver and the China, you two, put together a selection of teas, and a couple of... three tiered stands. Sandwiches and... petit fours on the bottom. You've got scones, I-Irish soda bread, jam and cheese, and clotted cream and-and gooseberries, and... A-a-and-and the lighter... delicate pastries on top. - Right? Okay. - Got it. I'm just gonna Google a couple of things. - Google? - Mm-hm. Yeah, you ever heard of it? We'll pair the jasmine tea with fig scones and a raspberry preserve, the hibiscus tea with a green apple tart. Alongside cucumber, egg and cress sandwiches. I've plenty of recipes at the ready... unfortunately, they are all in my head. Fine. You're in charge. [door opens] ♪ Work me honey ♪ With me baby ♪ Are you tired? [James] Wow. Everyone hard at work, I see. Someone hard at play, as usual. [James] Yeah, as usual. ♪ Watch out da da da da... Uh... so this is what Lords do? You guys, just come and check on the help? No, that's not the way it is. When was the last time you were down here? Well, I've actually come to see if you three would like to come to afternoon tea. Oh, I-I-I don't think so. No. It doesn't matter if you're wearing half the food. You'll still be the most stunning person there. She doesn't have anything proper to wear. Define proper. Well, a party dress... and a fascinator should do the trick, I'd say. What does a fascinator fasten to? - Some part of you. - [Catalina] Hmm. Anyway, there's a dressing room. Has my mother's old clothes in it. You should be able to find something suitable in there. Could you help her out, Rory, please? Thanks, guys. He still never beaten me. ♪ Yeah They all belong to, uh, [CatLord Perry's wife? es! [Rory] Lady Isabelle. How about... this one? She was wearing that the first time we met. I was ten. She did a lot of charity work with kids and she came to visit the children's home where I lived. You grew up in a children's home? I-I should've never brought up your childhood. I am so sorry. On me as long as I can remember. So there wasn't a lot of joy growing up. But that day Lady Isabelle came to visit St. Paul's, that was one of those days. She showered us with kindness. And that's when I became spell bound by these aristocratic families who live in the big houses. I wanted to get behind those walls. Be one of them. That dress is a good choice. And a fascinator... fastens to your head. Oh! So a hat? It's good. I don't know, this one's kind of tame. I think we can do better. ♪ Taken just a little taken just a little... ♪ It clashes with the dress. [laughs] ♪ Taken just a little... - I forbid it. - Then this is clearly the one. - [Catalina] Come on. - No! Yes. [orchestral music] Nice dress. [chuckles] [chuckles] What... What are you doing? I'm taking photos. For my cookbook. What, James didn't tell you? Oh, okay, well... I-I obviously I would never publish anything without the family's permission, I just... haven't gotten around to asking for it yet, so... Can you keep it to yourself for now? For now. Well, isn't this getting interesting? [Finn chuckles] - The pastries look amazing. - Of course they do. Mrs. O'Donnell has been taking credit for my work for well over a year. Now they've hired the new, younger, wind up and go version. Finn, I am only here for a week, so whatever frustration you have over your work situation has nothing to do with me. Okay. Let's go over some basic afternoon tea etiquette. Each place setting has a tea cup sauce or teaspoon plate, napkin, utensils and a place card. A protocol suggests that each person spend the first half of the tea talking with the person to their left. - Okay. Who is Mr. McGahey? - That is me. And the second half of the party talking to the person on their... Right! Which is... Oh, it's me. - [Rory] Great. - Shall we? Yes... Let's. Hold the tea cup by the handle, never by the bowl. Stir up and down with your spoon, not in circles. Oh, and uh, be sure to keep your pinky out. Oh, and spin around and hop on one foot at the same time. - This is serious. - [James] Is it? - [James] To who? - To your family. You may not care about these traditions, but the people you love do. Okay, maybe this was a bad idea. I don't really feel I'm up to... [James] No, don't let Rory stress you out. He takes things too seriously. James doesn't take things seriously enough. I'd say date with Rory is a bit like a trip to the headmaster's office. And a date with James must feel like minding a toddler. Oh, lucky for us, none of us are on a date. [door opens] Rory. Oh, uh, I invited Cat and Rory. That's not the usual way things are done. Especially with mum here. Is that Isabelle's? - We should go. - Yeah. It's fine, Rory. Stay. Thank you, Lord Perry. [chair scraping] I imagine you're pretty pleased that Rory's here. Considering he's the son you wish you had, right? Incorrect. But at least he showed some respect for our traditions and lifestyle. The things you take great pleasure in thumbing your nose at, but of which you still enjoy the spoils. [door opens] [door shuts] Sit, please. This looks surprisingly good. [sighs] Well, Finn did most of it. - Oh. Well done, Finn. - Thank you, M'lady. Hmm! Ooh! I love this. [tea pouring] Is it... Oh! [clicks tongue] Oh, dear! This one. Yes. Thank you, Rory. [tea pouring] Thank you. [orchestral music] You haven't touched your tea. [clinking] [tense music] [slurping] Mmm, mmm! Well... I've never seen that technique before. Come on, Grams, I love you to death but you're being a bit of a shrew. I don't mind that you've developed a certain irreverent look at society. But I did not teach you to be disrespectful, or to forget who you are, and who butters your bread. It's obvious you need more discipline and guidance than your father has been giving you. All of your gallivanting across America has been nothing more than a sea to shining sea tour of dimwitted socialites. Your escapades plastered across every gossip site imaginable. You've embarrassed your father. Your grandfather, and me. Maybe you're embarrassed because you wasted your life in a castle. Perhaps you've forgotten your place, my boy. Well, I mean, you're right, I don't know where my place is. I do intend to find it. I want to find adventure and purpose. Just like Cat has. [Edwina] Hmm? As you're such an inspiration... why don't you tell us something about yourself? Whereabouts in the States are you and your family from? Uh, California. But, my-my grandparents actually came from Columbia. Much like you guys, really. Um, the Gonzalezes go back generations there. And we are also a tight knit family, you know, with a lot of us under one roof, so... Hmm! That sounds rather lovely. It gets really claustrophobic. Like everybody's just... in each other's business, and... It's really kinda what inspired my food truck and my traveling. Because, uh, huh! You know, you just kind of want to escape sometimes. You want to escape your family? Oh, no. No, no, I don't mean it like that. I love them. I just, they're... You know, be a little bit annoying. Hmm. You never mentioned your father. Yeah, um, he is the one person who did leave. He's a used car salesman. What is a used car? Uh... Well, he's-he's... charismatic, um, larger than life. People say that he can get any guy to buy a lemon and any lady out of her pants. He was like the Jorge Clooney of Boyle Heights. I guess I'm a bit like my dad in that way, just... rolling stone, in my work, in my relationships. Just keep moving. 589 is my password to like, all of my devices... so... Um... so-so, no, I-I haven't, I haven't talked to my dad... in a long time. But, um, he-he did teach me how to rebuild a carburetor. So... That's super cool. Well, I for one think, following your bliss is a good thing. In fact, it's something I think that me and Cat have in common. [Edwina] Sounds like you and she know quite a lot about each other. Oh, yeah. We have shared certain things. [Catalina] U-uh... Uh, James and I... [stuttering] James was just a customer. A-at my food truck. You know, he really liked my taco. [James chuckles] [Perry clears throat] Yes, that's, uh, that's quite enough. It's clear you met my son's alter ego in America, but here, he should be addressed as Lord James. Lord James. Yeah, yeah, uh, hmm. Is... um... Uh, it's just like all that formality really necessary? I mean, pinky in, pinky out, we're all just... people. Right? And honestly, beneath all the flowery talk, it seems like you guys have the same problems as most families. And, calling your son Lord James might be kind of weird 'cause I've seen him naked. [chuckles] [sighs] [James clears throat] Look, I'm sorry, when I get nervous, I talk more, I-I lose my filter. No, no, no, you were acting a maggot. Yeah, yeah, I was a total maggot. Can I-can I make this right somehow? Can I go and apologize to The Duchess? God, no! No, just leave it alone. [sighs] Am I fired? James wouldn't let me do that, so no. James and I, we never dated or anything. That's none of my business. Look, we just need to get through the next few days and then we can all move on. By the sounds of it, you are a lot like James. You both move on quickly. Meet me here at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow, and dress warm. We've to get to the farmer's market and back to make a traditional Irish breakfast. Yes. I got it. And I hope you're more prepared for the ball and banquet. [[mellow music]] Things here are a disaster. Book unlikely. These folks are uptight snobs. And Her Majesty Mum... has a real stick... up her bum. [keyboard clacking] [music continues] [sighs] [instrumental music] So, fresh start... new day. Thank God, because this market is a chef's dream. [violin music] [chuckles softly] Everything is locally sourced. The fruit and veg is grown on nearby land. The animals are raised on family farms. The fish is caught in the surrounding waters. Most of the farmers are second third, fourth generation. They come here to feed the community. [Catalina] Hmm. Can we check out that stand? The Kerrigans have been raising livestock as long as anyone can remember. Um, can I have two of those, please? - Mrs. Kerrigan? - Yes. - [Rory] Thanks. - Thank you. Uh, this one... The Rileys treat their chickens like their children. Hennifer Lopez eats better than I do. - Well, Noel, how's it going? - Uh, sucking diesel. Though business has been slow. Town's been going through a bit of a rough patch. You haven't noticed? Things are busy up at the house. You know, the Duchess visit... Quite a handful, that one. Hmm, you don't know the half of it. Um, can I get a dozen eggs, please? Ah, don't bother at all. - Cheers, Noel. - Have a good one. Oh, my God, look at that cheese. - [Catalina] I need all of it. - Hey, not that one. T-there are other vendors sell cheese, so we... Okay, but hers looks amazing. [Rory] Yeah, but her, um... T-t-the, her... The goats are mean. - And it's bitter-bitter... - They're-they're mean? - Bitter aftertaste. Mm. - You're a weirdo, come on. Hi. Rory! Rory McGahey, as I live and breathe. Haven't laid eyes on ya in yonks, what's the craic? - Divil a bit? How are you? - Hmm! Hmm, you know, just... out here with the working people. Trying to get by. While you're holed up in your tower like Rapunzel. That's my job, Saoirse. Are you guys friends? We used to be. - We grew up together. - At St. Paul's. Who would've thought our Rory would end up living in a castle one day? And forget all his oldest friends. - I haven't forgotten. - You missed my last birthday. No, sorry, my last three birthdays. Okay, uh... I... We had to come over 'cause your cheese looks incredible. - Can I try some? - Yes, of course you can. That's a, a goat's cheese made in a lactic style with a boost from vegetable rennet, coated in a vegetable ash. That melts in your mouth. Can I try this one? Yes, that's a, a washed curd goat gouda with nutty and floral notes. It's, like, unlike anything I've had before. That's the aim, yeah. We're a small operation, but we try to make the best product we can. It has been more of a challenge this year, though. All of the vendors are struggling. But we have faith, we'll be okay because we know we're all in it together. We know we can rely on one another. Well, most of us can. It's not fair. Okay, wait. So, let's do... a cheese based grazing platter at the house tomorrow. We'll buy everything you have. And you can come and help set up the platters. - Are you serious? - Yeah, absolutely. Ah, it's not exactly the hors d'oeuvres we promised. That is him emphatically agreeing. Yeah, he's bursting with excitement on the inside. [laughs] All right, we'll see you tomorrow. Yes, you will. - Bye. - Bye. [indistinct chatter] I hope she likes goat gouda. Whatever that is. [birds chirp] [Catalina] No, way. Cillian's boyfriend is Finn? But Cillian's like an angel on earth, and Finn... He's a decent guy in the end. Maybe a little threatened by you. I don't get love, I guess. That's why I prefer to be in a relationship of one. At least I'm the devil I know. You certainly are. [birds chirp] So, what do you think it is between those two? [Rory] They're two puzzle pieces that fit together. More than the sum of their parts, you know? Hmm. That's how I feel when I'm creating a new dish. There's more to life than food, you know? - [Catalina] Like? - Family, love, home. Those two are each other's home. I don't think I've ever experienced anything like that before. Okay. This should be the Irish breakfast you're used to. - But, um, with a few twists. - [Perry] Hmm. Thank you, Rory. [Edwina] Mmm! - Beans are quite good. - [Edwina] Mmm! Mmm! So good. And the black pudding is excellent. - Hmm, mmm. - Thank you. So, I'm going into town tomorrow to talk to the developer about the house. - Should I go with you? - No need. We should talk about it before you go, then. There's nothing to talk about yet. You'd, uh, it seems like such a shame... to let this beautiful house get turned into, like, a fancy hotel or condos that nobody could really afford anyway. You know what I mean? Okay. Oh, wow, that smells delightful. Oh, okay. Oh, my God. You've done it again. Did you sleep well? Um, yes. Thank you, Lord James. [James chuckles] What're you doing after breakfast? Oh, I'm working on recipes for the banquet. No, you got less time for that. You should have some time off, right? I don't really do time off. Really? Well, you should. You know, today. With me. Well, what would we do? Um, archery? Croquet? Maybe a walk through the gardens, I don't know. I have some spare time. Maybe I could join you. Yeah, I'd-I'd love that, mate, but... we have maintenance workers arriving today, don't we? We thought Grams is arriving this afternoon, so we... [James] I'm really sorry. Excuse me. Seriously... insane, this sausage. - Hmm. - Thanks. Okay, so what am I supposed to do? You hit the ball through the hoop. Why? Well, because that's the point of the game. Smartass! Okay. So, I'm trying to hit the bullseye, yeah? [James] Yes, it is correct. - Why? - Because it's fun. If you say so. Before you ask, the reason you walk through the gardens is to walk through the gardens. There is no point. The goal is just to take in the beauty around you. What, no witty comeback? Do you have something stuck in your throat? Oh, my God! I'm just doing what you said. Oh, good. Well, little bit less fun when you do it like that. And quite a bit more dangerous. Right. Yeah. - Oh, that was fun. Wow! - Mm! Is this what you royals do all day? Yeah, I mean, sometimes. What do you do to relax? I don't. Kidding. I cook. - But, that's your work. - It's my everything. [instrumental music] It really is beautiful out here. It certainly is. And, up and up. Yeah, get it up. Okay. Loosen your grip. - Loosen. - Yes. There we go. Now you have to trust me. Come on back. And aim. Aim. And... down. Release. Wow! So, like, what is the deal with you and your family? Oh! We don't see eye-to-eye on very much. Um, both my father's and grandmother's lives have always centered around being a Covington. Very hard for them to understand wanting a life outside of that. That was more exhilarating than I thought. Thank you. I've had worse reviews. [chuckles] What would I find if I googled you? Uh, ha-ha. I don't know. Few photos taken out of context... and a few cheeky headlines, probably. "The Untoward Lord." - That was good one. - Yeah. Uh, "Marquess in Undress." - Nice. - Yeah. "James and the giant peach." Didn't really get that one. - Wow! - Yeah. But, you know, womanizing... well, if you wanna call it... are too wildly exaggerated. Somewhat exaggerated. I know, who am I to complain? But, I do feel like I get boxed into being this one thing, this... spoiled, bad-boy royal. That's not the totality of who I am. Well, you can't let other people tell you who you are. You decide who you want to be and be it. - What, just like you have? - Mm. I'm not sure I've ever met anyone as driven as you. Well, I'm not sure I've ever met anybody as carefree. [Catalina chuckles] [instrumental music] [sighs] [knocking on door] James? [knocking on door] Coming! [Catalina gasps] - Ah! I'll get it. - Oh! - No, no, no. Oh, my God! - Sorry. Sorry. I didn't see, sorry, I didn't see anything. - I said coming! - You said come in. - Coming. I said... - You said, come in. - Come in. You said, come in. - Coming. Coming. - It was in. - Anyway, that's okay. Um... What do you need? Um... Ah... Carburetor, you... The cars, you said you're good with cars and the like? - I am, yeah. - I, um, I need help. - Yeah? Great. - I need your help on something. I'll be right there. Can you just... - Thank you. I'll be right there. - Whenever you are naked. Whenever you're ready. [sighs] Um... I don't see anything wrong with the car. Yeah, I know. - Then, what am I doing here? - I want you to... you know, unspark the plug, or put the oil in the carburetor... just-just banjax it. The family is barely tolerating me as it is, and now you want me to sabotage The Duchess's car? Lady Edwina is insisting on driving into town tomorrow, as you've seen, she shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the car. Nobody has the nerve to tell her she can't drive. So, we're going to perform a service for the public-at-large. Oh, the public-at-large? Or you? So, you don't want The Duchess to meet the developers, so now you're committing a crime. I would never do that. That's why you're here. Okay. Pass me the socket wrench. - Oh, my God! Jesus! - Yeah. [chuckles] Okay. [indistinct chatter] Loosey, loosey. - Looks important. - Yeah. It's kind of the point. Okay. Okay. There's no going back after this. No one will know. God! [Cillian] Oh, ravish me, Duke. It's too risky, My Lord. What if someone spots us? [Finn] Then, let them. I can't stand to be away from you for a moment longer, I'd rather die. But, our families are mortal enemies. We could be stripped of our titles. Then, I don't want to be Lord Finneas, the Sultan of Shagging. [crackling] [Finn] Who's there? [clearing throat] And... Yeah, that's how that works. [Rory] All right, so just like a tractor really. [Catalina] Ah, yeah, yeah. Pretty much, kind of, yeah. Oh, damn! You guys. You know, I thought I was rocking that fascinator earlier, but you are showing me up. Role-play is a healthy way to spice up a relationship. Oh, I'm not judging. I used to date a guy who liked to play "Blue Man Group." - That's weird. - Yep. Wait. Did you two pilfer Lord Perry's closet? - That's for sure his tie. - O-of course not. That would be a fireable offense. Yeah. And what are you two doing out here this late at night, huh? - Uh... - Uh, well, um... [both stammering] Well, I noticed that The Duchess's car had oil leaking, and so I was just wanted to make sure that it was good. - [Rory] Very good. - Yeah, and Rory is, um... - Helping. - Yeah, helping. Oh! With-with his face? You should probably clean yourselves up a bit. I might know the perfect way. [instrumental music] Okay, isn't this also a fireable offense? - Probably. - Definitely. If anyone snitches, I was never here. Got it. [laughing] Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Oh, thorn! Ahh! - [Cillian] Oye! [Catalina] Get in, get in, get in, get in. Ooh! It's hot. [Rory sighing] [all laughing] So, how does it feel breaking the rules? It's pretty hot. [laughing] Oh, my God, there is that smile again. - Okay, - All right. I'm just saying it suits you. You should do it more often. [instrumental music] I love you. Oh, come on. [Catalina laughs] Ooh! [Catalina laughing] No! Oh! Rory! - I told you... - You! [Cillian] No, no, don't, stop, stop. Oh! [laughter] Good day, Lord Perry. Are you going on a stroll? The gardens are magnificent. Uh, yes, I-I'm aware. Thank you. Um, is-is, is The Duchess joining you? Uh, well, her car wouldn't start this morning. So, Cillian drove her into town. Ah. What, may I ask, are you doing? Oh, I-I'm waiting for a special delivery. In fact, uh, here it is. - Hi, welcome. - Hi. - Welcome! - Thank you. I've never seen this place up close and personal. It certainly doesn't disappoint. As far as most of us in town are concerned, there could be mythical beasts living here. Or Harry Potter. [both laugh] I assure you there are not. Beasts. Nor boy magicians. I'm Lord Perry. I know, of you. Hiya. God, that is not proper, is it? Um, it's, it's a pleasure to meet, Your Acquaintance. No need for all that. We're not formal around here. I'm Saoirse. Saoirse. What is happening? Uh, do you need me to, um... help you carry things inside? If you don't mind. I'm just as capable as the next man carrying things. [van door opens] [Perry grunts] [Catalina chuckles] ♪ You are afraid of me ♪ I can see it in your eyes ♪ You want this sweet mystery ♪ And I think it's... Okay. I, I think we have it from here. Right? Thank you so much for helping. Well, excellent. As you, as you were. Um... w-w-will we be seeing you later at the... ahem, at the-the-the ball? Both of you are welcome, a-and Rory to attend, of course. There's-there's a ball? [Perry] Oh, it's nothing really, an excuse to dress up. Oh, my God! Actually, yes, I mean, I actually inherited a bunch of really gorgeous ball gowns from my Aunt Groeneine, I don't actually have anywhere to wear them, so sometimes I put one on when I'm vacuuming. It's, it's a whole thing. Well, do you have an extra vacuuming-gown for me? Yes, I do. Great. So, we-we'll be there. Wonderful. - Your sausage. - Thank you. Yes. Thank you. That boy was tripping over his tongue. I mean, he's already bad with words, but that was... But he's cute, don't you think? You know what? I think doesn't really matter. Yeah, that's because you've been too busy... being sweet on Rory, haven't you? I could see it clear as day at the market. Rory and I haven't seen an awful lot of each other over a last couple of years, but he's a good man. He always has been. He's always been kind of like a big brother to me. Loyal, protective. I can see that. Most women would probably go in for Lord James. Sexy, charming, fun, or so I've read. What? There might be a little something brewing there too. Well, look at you. [both laugh] You are in quite the predicament, aren't you? I know. What am I gonna do? It's not my problem. [Catalina laughs] [orchestral music] You made my cheese look really good. Well, you're making that dress look really good. Oh. You know who else might think so? [music continues] I'm so glad you could stay. I can't say that I've spent many afternoons like this. Or any afternoons at all, in fact. Guess I feel a bit out of place. You don't look it. Um, but I, I understand how you feel, um... Well, sometimes when I go into town, I... feel like some sort of strange creature who doesn't fit in. I-I realize now... I should've been making more of an effort with the townspeople to mix in, because clearly... I've been missing out. [music continues] Would you, would you like a go? You know what? I'd love to. [instrumental music] [Saoirse chuckles] How was your evening? - Uneventful. Mm. - Really? [James] We've been friends a long time, right? Almost like brothers, really. I just hate to see anything get in the way of that. I can't see what would. Okay. Wow! - Do you wanna dance? - Sure. - Really? With me? - Yeah? I guess. - Great. I'll teach you. - All right. One... Uh-hum... [Catalina chuckles] [James] There, you got it. [Catalina] Here goes. - Oh, you are good. Wow! - Oh. I can follow. This will be like the first date we never had. Mm? Mm. Oh! Except your grandma's here. [Edwina] I see you've started without me. Seems like new people are popping up all over the place. Since James started this trend of bringing others, I thought I'd do the same. Cillian was game from the get-go. But Finn was harder to convince. But, ultimately, who can say no to me? Evidently, no one, Ma'am. [Catalina chuckles] You lost step. Let's do a twirl. [Catalina chuckles] You don't mind, do you, dear? Uh-hm. [Catalina chuckles] [music continues] So, do you approve of my take on hor d'oeuvres? Breaking the rules suits you. I couldn't have done it without Saoirse. I know that things are complicated, but you should really reach out to her. - I don't think she wants that. - Mm. I think she misses you. [Catalina] Like a lot. And a friend like that is pretty rare. Are you going to leave some for anybody else? That what it's there for. Walk away from the cheese board. Come dance with me. [music continues] [chuckles] What? [Rory] You all ready for tomorrow, big banquet? Oh, I think so. I am working on some recipes tonight. If you wanna come be my taste tester? Oh, am I qualified for that? Loving to eat food is the only qualification. - Oh, is that? - Yes. [Catalina chuckles] Oh. [Catalina chuckles] - May I? - [Perry] I'd be delighted. - Well, this is a disaster. - Okay. [Saoirse chuckles] Thank you. [music continues] Well, your chef friend has really turned things around, hasn't she? I will admit, she's rather impressive. And she's not afraid of me, so... she has that going for her. If you want to be with her, Rory, you need to take a chance. [music continues] [sighs] [wom[sizzles]zing] [Catalina] Okay, so... I know that I promised authentic Colombian recipes, but the Irish don't really have all the ingredients I needed. - So, we did our best. - Okay. Um, but I have been making these since I was a kid. My abuela taught me, like, before I could read. So, they should be pretty good. First one is... Sobrebarriga en salsa criolla. - This is sancocho. Arepas. - Right. It translates to chicken soup. My uncle had an arepa factory in Medellin. But I promise you that does not do it justice. And all of us kids learned how to make 'em. Oh! Oof! And chorizo and potato empanadas with an aji picante. And I just chose one of this, right? Yes. Take a little bit of this, put it on that. - Do what you will. Yeah. - Okay. Go for it. Well, actually, I... Actually I wouldn't. What? Why? That's spicy, and, and you're Irish. That's fair. Wow! Well, all I know is, if I had a family who loved me enough to teach me how to do that, I would do whatever it takes to make it right. And the same for your father. There's only one person in the world with that title. Yeah, you are right. I will work on it, when I get back home. Right. Home. ♪ Just so good ♪ I found this... [woman vocalization] [Perry clears throat] [Perry] Sorry to interrupt. I, ah... just came down for a snack. Well, then, you came to the right place. I would love a second taste-tester. Well... I've had plenty of meat and potatoes in my life, but nothing quite like this. [laughs] - Milk please, Rory. - Mm. Don't let me interrupt the... conversation. What were you two talking about? - Family. - Family. Ah, well, that can be a... thorny thing to navigate. Hm. [Perry] You fall in love, get married, have children. The children grow up and it... gets harder and... your wife passes away... We used to, uh, we used to sneak down here and eat ice cream. Talk until all hours. That's really lovely. Isabelle's passing might've been the start of the... rift between James and me. We both dealt with her death in different ways. I tried to hold him too close and... he just wanted to run away... and just kept running. [Catalina] Well... you should extend an olive branch. Usually how it goes from there. [Rory] If everyone bends a little, there's usually a way to fix it. I hope so. It would break Isabelle's heart to see us like this. We all miss her. But I'm sure... she would want you to see you happy again. [chuckles] You're talking about Saoirse? [laughter] Did I make a complete fool of myself today? - Not at all. - No. - It was very cute. Yeah. - I think she likes ya. [clears throat] [Catalina] Oh, actually... [Rory] I wouldn't actually... - What... - I don't know I would do that. - It's... It's not for us. - [Catalina] No, no, no. - No. - What's going on in here? I could hear you upstairs. Oh! Can an old lady have some food? Of course. I am thinking of using some of these flavor profiles for my take on shepherd's pie tomorrow. Mm. I could see how that might work. Oh, I just do... Okay, that was a lot. [tense music] Um... [coughing] I really hope you don't take this the wrong way, but you are one tough broad. How could I possibly take that the wrong way? [laughter] I get my constitution from my mother. She was a countess, but she was also a nurse during the war. She could make one hell of a shepherd's pie. I would've been honored to cook with your mom. And if you still remember her recipe, we can totally make one hers for tomorrow. I appreciate that you've tried to honor our traditions while making things your own. I look forward to seeing what you do tomorrow. Be yourself. Let's see what you've got. Yes, Ma'am. And thank you. It-it really means a lot. I mean, food has always been the thing that unites all the people in my life for me. It's what I try to do... with my food truck and my cookbook and... The, uh, actually... speaking of, um... I actually wanted to ask you guys something. I would love your permission to include you and... Sorry, guys. Am I interrupting? Oh, no, it was actually perfect timing. I was just telling them the thing we talked about. Oh, that, um... I just really don't think it's the appropriate time for that actually. Why not? Um... can-can I speak to you alone, Cat, please? We're actually in the middle of something. Oh, really? Are you? Oh, I'm-I'm really sorry. I'm just gonna have to pull rank actually, because I am the one who hired Cat and you. [scoffs] [James] So... Cat, come on. I And pulling rank like that? ut I don't takReally? s from you. I'm really sorry. I-I was completely flustered. Okay. So, what's so important? Can we just go someplace that's isn't here? Just give me a few minutes, please. Ooh, it's the Untoward Lord! I've got your giant peach right here, James. And I thought the townspeople and the royals had like an uneasy vibe, but, um, you seem popular. Yeah. They read too many tabloids. The only person I care about right now... that's you. Come on. Let's go. [laughter] [Catalina] All right. What's up? Okay. Um... So, I saw you and Rory together the other night. And, you know, just the way you were with him in the kitchen right now, I mean, it's pretty obvious to me that I'm losing my chance here, so it's time to just put it all out in the line. When we first met in L.A., I felt like we were in very different places in our lives. But, since you've been here, I feel like we've made a real connection. I think you've might have changed me somehow. No one thought it was possible. But I really do. I want more now because of you. I mean, I agree it's been really nice getting to know each other in a different way. Come on. It's been more than nice. It's... We understand each other. Right? We... we're the same in some way, or at least we want the same things. And I have the resources to afford us the life of our dreams. Travel, adventure. Whatever, we could find our purpose together. That sounds wonderful. James, I... I-I can't. You're gonna-you're gonna choose him over me? - I'm sorry. - It's fine. James, I... ♪ Oh that's a great love ♪ And a big desire My grandson needs to grow up. It's very disappointing. You're the one who allowed him to bring that woman into this house, to create havoc on this family. The publicity is disappointing. But my son is a grown man. And I must admit, this last week, the food, the company... it's been more fun than we've had here in a long time. Cat brought a fresh, new spirit into the house. Spirit? But an agenda. She's been using us, and you and James are too blind to see it. Well, it's made my decision about the house an easy one. I'm going to sell, and you and James are moving back to London with me. Hey. - What... - Glad you could join us. Okay, that is not what it looks like. It's taken way out of context. [Edwina] A photo can't be taken out of context. It tells us everything we need to know. Is that my computer? You left it on the counter last night. Password, just keep moving-5-8-9. There are some interesting emails on here. "To Dee. Things here are a disaster. Book unlikely. These folks are uptight snobs, and Her Majesty Mum has a real stick up her bum." [Catalina] You went through my emails? My job is to protect my family. And I needed to know what your real agenda was, and now I do. You want to write a tell-all book about us. You seduced my grandson in order to gain access to... You encouraged James' bad behavior. Created a fissure between him and Rory. And now, my son is romantically interested in a cheesemonger! Here's what's going to happen. You will leave this house immediately... and never come back. [mellow music] I don't want to be with James. That photo begs to differ. Of course, you want James. He is... Lord James Covington, 12th Marquess of Cornworthy. He gets what he wants. He always has... he always will. He doesn't get to have me. - If you'd just listen... - [Rory] Stop. The, uh... The royal banquet is obviously not happening any more, so there's no reason for you to be here. You're free to move on to whatever's next. Rory...

[speaking in Irish] - No. - [Cillian] Yeah. [Cillian] The Duchess... [grunting] Rory... The family... Buh-bye. Thank you for that recap. That was really good. - Are you okay? - I will be. Maybe I don't know. - Did you try to apologize? - Of course, I did. Yeah, I mean... you don't seem like the sort of person who quits things. It's too late. Like, The Duchess has already decided to sell the house and they are already gone. - Just for the weekend. - Mm. Which gives us time. Just-just somehow get the whole family to forgive me? And then convince that they shouldn't sell the house? And somehow get Rory to see that we belong together? Well, yeah. That's insane. [violin music] Okay. Okay. I came here to put on a banquet. Banquets are about people, right? So what if instead of a royal banquet, we do a unroyal one? - Don't know what that is? - That's not a thing. Okay. Follow along. Um, can you contact the farmer's market vendors and any pubs that might be interested in joining us? - Yeah, you bet I can. - Good. [Catalina] We're gonna put on a bona fide feast for the entire town, everybody is invited. It'll be, like, on the grounds of the castle. That way, we'll do a boost for all of the vendors that we buy from, we feed the town for free. And, you know, by the time the Covingtons are back, they won't be able to stop us. And this way, they can see all the people they'd be leaving behind if they moved. [Saoirse] I heard about this big house over in Cork where the family still lived there, but they let the townspeople tour the house. - And picnic on the grounds. - That's kind of brilliant. I think that's what they should do. [Saoirse] I think Lord Perry might go in for something like that. - I think James would too. - Well, but... The Duchess is a different story. Yeah, but they all need purpose. And I think opening up the house and giving them an opportunity to help the town that's gonna give it to them. [Saoirse] I think you are right. - Yeah. - And I will be here cooking. - Think Finn might help? - He'll be here. [Catalina] Great. Let's go to work! Go, go, go! [chuckles] [indistinct chatter] [glasses clinking] [music continues] Yeah. All right. Here you go. Some fresh shepherd's pie. I know. - It's pretty good. - [Finn] It could've been worse. [laughter] We did it! [chuckles] Ooh! Okay! Moment of truth. - The regals have landed. - [Catalina] Ah! I'm going to reason with 'em. Present a logical argument. Appeal to his moral conscience. [Catalina laughs] [crowd cheering] Why, Jean! Yes! Did you like that? [indistinct chatter] [clears throat] Hi, Perry. Saoirse? Remember when you said that you wished... you felt like you were more a part of the community? Well, you got your wish. 'Cause we've brought the community to you. What's the meaning of this? What on earth is going on here? I am not going to curtsy, because I'd like to speak as equals. Woman to woman. We are putting on an unroyal banquet. What gave you the audacity to think you could do this? You did. I thought, what would The Duchess do? I was never planning on writing a tell-all book. I was hoping to include you and your family in a cookbook. I would obviously never publish anything without your approval. And it's just a draft. But, um... this is what I wanted to ask permission for. And, well, I have a idea about what you could do with the house. Selling it is one way to go. My way, usually the only way. Good point. But, counterpoint... Counterpoint? Another option... could be to open it up to the public. You know, for picnics or tours. Like... Just look around. Just take it in. The energy, the joy, the people. I mean, it could be like this every weekend. The estate would, of course, still be yours. But it could also function as a meeting place, like, a town square of sorts. I mean, you could even run a cooking school out of it. And-and Finn could be in charge of it, and then you could have an unroyal banquet every week. Use the resources that your birthright gave you... to feed the town. [chuckles] Oh! That sounds... ambitious. I like it. You both think this is what we should do? - We do. - Yeah. Okay! Let's celebrate. In my family, we hug. - Uh, baby steps, dear. - Okay. [Catalina chuckles] My only goal with the house was always to be closer to the two of you. Perhaps I could stay here for a portion of the year. It certainly is big enough for all of us. Is it, though? Perhaps, we need another wing. [James] No, I don't think so. I think I'm actually going to move out. Maybe it's time for me to figure out where my life is without my title... or even your money. I don't know what it's going to look like, but I'm excited to find out. Oh. I don't know when this monarchy turned into a democracy, but... [sighs] So be it. - Thought I told you to go home. - Hmm. Since when do I do anything you tell me to do? Hm. Does that ever change? [chuckles] I can work on it. - So, where're you off to next? - Oh, well... The plan was to hit a couple of more countries, and... back to California. You know, I'm really glad you get to keep your job... your home. My home is wherever you are. Good. Jeez! They are really going for it, aren't they? [instrumental music] - Who's hungry? - Yeah... Yes. [laughter] Yeah, let's go inside.
