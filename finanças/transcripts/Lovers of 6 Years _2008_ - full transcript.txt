Do you have something against me? I'm so sorry, sir. - I haven't been driving long... - So what? Stay off the road, then! Any idiot with a license thinks he can drive. It's outrageous. But you're the one that cut in... Don't even start, lady. Hey. You didn't signal before butting in. You realize it's legally your fault? There's no damage, so let's forget it. You're lucky I'm a nice person. At least the insurance won't go up. Is that all you can say? You won't ask me if I'm okay? If you weren't, we'd be at the hospital by now. I'm not feeling well right now. You seem to be talking just fine. You're always thinking of yourself. It feels really shitty after a car accident. I should be the one yelling here! I'm speechless. - I really am. - Then don't say anything. Then don't say anything. - Jae-young> At least you know now. It's a new car, so he must be mad. Love isn't a fairy tale. Come on, now. You still believe in romance? It's just an illusion from TV dramas. Uh-huh. Us? She asks if she's invisible or something, but I can't just focus on her all the time. It's hard for me too. That's not what mature love is. Da-jin's nice and comfortable. It's been so long, she's like a sister sometimes. But still, that's not it. When did you come? Is family supposed to be like this? You heard it all? I was just trying to make her feel better. God, I'm pitiful. I'm sorry I'm not mature enough. But I really tried to make this work. Da-jin. Come on, Da-jin. Yes, ma'am. It's me. How have you been? Is Da-jin over there? Of course not. All right. Yes, I will. Take care. Okay. You're a mess. Mom, let me crash for a few days. Is this a B&B hotel? I have to do some repairs at home. Repairs? I'm gonna go in and rest. Da-jin. You want anything for dinner? You should watch what you say. Why'd you have to call me? By the way, that girl comes looking for you a lot. What? You can't get anything past me. You've lost your touch, lady. How far did you go? Go where? Did you sleep with her? Aw, come on. - It's not like that. - Never mind, then. If you're together this long, what's wrong with feeling like family? After each big fight like this, I wait for the right moment to make up. I'm tired of it. It's a never-ending cycle. Always questioning if it's love or not. Your girlfriend isn't calling you today. She won't talk to me. She ran away. So then you called me out because you fought with her. No. It's not like that. Then what? Well... You have fun with me. Same here. - So? - So? I'm feeling a bit lonely, so let's have fun together. You have a way of making me confused. Me? Oh? So what should we do? Come in. Sit down. You think this is okay? How about some wine? Sure. Hold on for one minute. Are you okay? You're asking me that and pouring me drinks? I'm still a bit flushed. Better? My hands are really cold. Wait. It looks so good. You're like a vampire or something. I'm not sure if you're a nice guy. But it's strange, how cute you are. Is this good too? Very. It's just how I like it. But... is it only me? Jae-young. My heart's pounding. I'll do it. Okay. What's wrong? Must be crazy. Hello? - Da-Jin, Where are you? - Sorry? You still want to sign me, don't you? Yes, of course. Then what's with the face? Aren't you happy? Of course I am. Feels nice and cool. It's much better like this. Oh, no way. Try it. It really feels better. Really. Hey, it does. Strange-looking feet. Do you come here often? Sometimes when I need some air. Seoul isn't much during the day, but it's beautiful at night. I don't know which one is real, though. All those people down there living together, people closest to each other. Do they all understand one another? I don't know if I do. I don't know. It's not easy being with someone. Do you even know? > You want some yogurt? It's all yours. All of it? Seriously? I think I've had too much. I'm getting queasy. I slipped something in it. Let's go to hell together. I'm kidding. Hey, what's this? A present. It's our best-seller. Wow, what should I pack inside? Is this a sign that you want me to go? No, I just thought you'd need it. Why don't I take you in here? How the heck will I fit in that? Why not? I can slice you up into pieces. What? Let's go. Don't get scared. Let's stay like this for a minute. Are you really here because I'm sick? Here. That's good. It tastes like coffee. I have it whenever I need a few drinks, but have a lot of work to do. Looks like one won't do the trick. I need it to sterilize my head. There's too much crap stuck in there. It's much better than I had expected. Isn't there anything you can't do, Da-jin? No one should be perfect. You can drink, you sure can threaten, you can cook, and you're funny. An easy target, gullible... I'm not perfect at all. You're a great person, just as you are. How much coffee do you pour? As much as you want. This is the album. Your bribe. It's nice. I've heard it so many times, I feel like I hear it, even if it's not on. Just as you are... Your nose is bleeding! God, this is embarrassing. Talk about timing. You shouldn't pull your head back. You should press down on it. Even kindergartners know that. Did you get some sleep? I think dark circles are sexy on a woman. What's this? Energy booster. Tastes like coffee. Me too. Why didn't you answer the phone? You won't see me anymore? When did you come? A while ago. Why did you wait here so long? To see you. Are you okay? I heard the biopsy results are out. Min-Jae told me. Oh, he did. You didn't tell my mom, did you? I didn't think she knew, so I didn't. Good. That's why you came. They said it would be fine. Yeah, of course it will. Come home. They're almost finished. It's late. Go inside. I'll call you. Have a seat. When did you get in? Are you gonna keep this up? What? You're thirty now. It's about time you respect my privacy. Right? It's the guy you used to play with, right? Nothing gets by you. Yes, it's him. Are you happy, Mom? - Yes. - That's all that matters. But still, you could have told me. Moms are scared of their children too. - You're back. - Yeah. Cleaned up nice. It'll be done once they finish the bathroom. You wanna come over for some wine? Wine? Just to celebrate your return. Was someone here? What do you mean? I saw a new toothbrush in the bathroom. Oh, someone from work. That's right. After drinking last week. I see. Are you free on Sunday? It's my dad's birthday. Let's go. Sunday? How about some music? This is fine. - Oh, I have some grapes. - I'll go get them. Let's take the train this time. Are you okay? I can't. I can't go. Why not? Are you working? Are you happy with me? Sure. Why do you insist on living next to me? 'Cause we're gonna get married, aren't we? Not because we are or we have to... Don't tell me that. Tell me what you feel. I just did. What more is there? I'm sorry. I just don't know anymore. We might regret it, but you won't tell me the truth. Da-jin. I know I've made a lot of mistakes. So let's stop talking about this. Can't we just let it go? Hello? Now's not a good time. How about tomorrow? What? All right. Do I make you unhappy? Is that what you're saying? I didn't say It's about you. I'm just happy you're back. I wanted to be with you. Is that too much? Jae-young. We have to talk about this. Something came up at work. I'll be back. What are you doing here? You can't just come here like this. That's welcoming. I won't be long. Let's go somewhere and talk. I'm gonna go soon. I came to tell you, I got my ticket. So, you're finally going. Don't miss me too much. It feels weird, now that I'm really leaving. Could you stay with me, just for tonight? Oh, okay. I'll go. Wait. Cross the line, and you have to stay with me. Are you going to take the step? I might kill you if you change your mind. I'll take you home one last time. After that, you can do whatever you want. Can you go faster? Why? Are you feeling okay? There's a place I want to go to. Honestly, I'm using you today. I don't get it, but it's still good to see you. Look at me. I'm not kidding around. I really like you. I've been... seeing someone for six years. So? Do you love him? It's beyond that. We know everything about each other. I know which of his teeth has a cavity and how he got the scar on his head. Not how much you know him. Do you love him? There are different types of love. Then I guess It's okay for me to love you. Jin-sung. I want to try to find happiness on my own. Depending on others got me nowhere. Right now, I need to find myself first. Jae-young! Where are you going? KIM Jae-young! Stop! - What? - Just apologize. One word is all that it takes. Is that so hard? Sorry. Why can't you say it like you mean it? What's so hard about that? Da-jin, slap me just once. - What? - Just slap me. If I ever mess up again, you can shoot me. Asshole. Hello? - Where are you? - Why? Da-jin just rolled into ER with some guy. What? I'm going into surgery, so just get over here. Da-jin, does it hurt? What do I do? Hey! She's in pain. Do something. The stitches will be out in a week. She could get dizzy or a bit queasy, so find a nurse then, all right? Why are you here? Why are you? Who are you? LEE Jin-sung. Nice to meet you. Did you do this? I'm sorry. We slipped on my motorcycle. Motorcycle? A motorcycle at this hour? And who's that? I'm so sorry. They said she's fine now, but there might be some aftereffects, so please take care of her. Again, I'm sorry. What are you so sorry for? What makes you? Hey, Da-jin. And why are you getting all flushed? What's going on with you and him? He works with our company. The psycho that wanted the stupid LP? You weren't talking business on a motorcycle. Why were you out? And with him? Let him go. We'll talk alone. What did you two do together? We went to Namsan. Namsan... You went to our place with this guy? Did you go on the cable cars too? Are you nuts? There's no need to yell at her. There was no need for you to hit on my girlfriend. No? Stop it. I was stressed out, so I asked for a ride. Okay? You're stressed out, so you meet other guys? All that shit about happiness was an excuse. Why can't you just say you're cheating? You don't know your girlfriend at all. It's nothing like that. What the heck do you know, then? I can't freaking believe this. Just tell me the truth. - Did you sleep with him? - Are you insane? Insane? Did you sleep with him or not? It's not difficult. God, you're so... I'm what? What? Then why the hell is he so cocky, huh? Did you sleep with this fucker? Yeah, I did. Satisfied? Let's go, Jin-sung. Stay there, I'll go take a look. Get out. Get out! Why can't you take it like a man? Who told you to butt in, jackass? Did you just duck? Duck again. Huh? You little piece of shit! Jackass! You're so manly, so you hit on my girl? Huh? Punk! Hey! LEE Da-jin! Wait. I know why you're doing this. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I mean it. You're sorry? For what? I don't care what you did with him. I'm sorry, no matter what. Da-jin! It's too late! It won't change anything! You know. When you go deep into the water, and your feet come on and off the ground... It was just like that. If I just reached out, I could have touched it. Just blind faith. I think that's what it was. Since when? For a long time, I think. It sounds like an excuse, but you were always a sure thing for me. Yeah, I know. For me too, I think. Let's not try so hard to sugarcoat it. - Great work, sir. - The surgery went well. It's better to get rid of it, just in case. So, you're all cleaned up now? My boyfriend. Say hi. Self-improvement steps for white collar workers don't apply to most of our readers. Yes, I'm sorry. Thirsty? Have some of this, KWON. Thank you, ma'am. They say that books reflect their authors. I think you'll make great books. Thank you. Is it still not okay for me to ask you out? I'm gonna analyze myself for a while. I've been rejected again, haven't I... You should think about it too. The air is nice and clean in these parts. You'll like the next house even more. - It's nice, isn't it? - It is. Lots of sun, a great bargain... It'll be gone very soon. You here now, so why don't you sign today? So, we meet like this. I know. How are you? Good. Why are you moving? That house is nice. No reason. I enjoyed your book. You read it? It's my pride and joy. Is it that famous already? It was good. You look different. I do? There is something different. I quit smoking three months ago. Really? Looking at any more? No, I think I'm done for today. Well, I'm gonna go and see some more. Let's have coffee some time. All right. See you. Da-jin! How's your mother doing? You know her. She's a rock. Is it okay if I visit her some time? Sure. She was asking about you too. - Drop by some time. - Okay. Jae-young! Yeah? You kept this all this time? Huh? Wait, I'll go there. What's up? Are you okay? What would happen if we got back together? I'm okay. They do say that broken bones bind stronger. Could we be stronger too? Are you okay? Let me see. We'll probably lie, fight, and hurt each other, again. Then get sick of it and go our separate ways. Forgetting how much we missed each other. Forgetting how much we regretted it all.
