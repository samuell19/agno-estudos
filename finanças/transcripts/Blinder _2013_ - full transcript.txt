Grand Final selection tonight, So it's not too late to make changes. Stretch it out! It's more attitude I'm concerned of. What's he doing? Tommy! When you were a young fella, I seem to remember you being rather inspired... By a certain AFL player's words of wisdom. Gospel from the famous old Chang. Time to pass the baton, isn't it? Attitude and giving your absolute best. You might wanna talk to them... About that. Eh? You too! Let's see some football. Slow down. Hi, Sammy! Come on, boys! Hey, don't! Don't! Come on! Stop stuffin' around, Tommy. Oh, Jesus. - That was a good catch. - Mark. He seems... good. Morts will probably take the BNF this year. BNF? Best and fairest. What about him? Is he a good player? You don't normally watch. You hate footy. I don't hate it. - Hey, Tommy. - Hey. Hi. - Where will you be playing? - In the middle.

Well, who's the leading goal scorer In the Bellarine League this year? Uh, Davies at Ocean Grove. All right. Well, after him? Selwood at Anglesea. And next? That'd be you, Frank. Top three. Point taken. - I think you mean "point made" - Exactly. Can't we just worry about winning this Saturday? Yeah, well, the Final... Aah! My balls are on fire! That's a good thing, boy.

Yes! - How tough are we gonna be? - Cowboy tough! Let's get it now! Go, Tigers! Good afternoon and welcome to the Torquay Oval For the all-important Grand Final clash. The respective sides taking up their positions. You can almost just sense the atmosphere is palpable. It is electric. The ferals on that other side of the ground And the more demure and more mature Torquay Tiger audience, Who really don't know what is in store for them. And here we go. Ball's in the air. Anglesea with the tap, but straight down to Nicky Reagan. - Reagan boots it long. - Way down! Way down! And look, there's Mortimer on a lead. He takes a very strong mark. Strong grab, directly in front from 35 to 40 meters out. Hits truly. And the first point to the Tigers! Perhaps the only surprise selection today Is the omission of Tommy Dunn. Dunn had played every game this year, But Coach Chang in his wisdom had left him out. We'll see what consequences that has on the game. Dawson, with great dexterity, Breaks one tackle, runs down the wing. Ford up, great tackle. Didn't feel the hit coming. Should have got rid of it. He's holding the ball. Come on, come on, get in, get in! Robbo with the tap, but it's straight down to Harkins. He dispatches one opponent, kicks long. Dial goes up. What a screener for Anglesea! He juggled it beautifully as he came down. Dial slots the goal from 30. And Anglesea are looking very, very good. Rawlings with the tap, down to Reagan. Reagan with great evasive skills. One, two, three! Got rid of the entire pack. Now onto his right foot. Kicks long into the forward line, And Mortimer, Mortimer has taken a mark. Mortimer from 45. The distance will test him. It's good! This kid's going to be a champion. Robbo bolts down the wing, kicks long to the forward line. Tanner out in front takes a strong chest mark. Reagan runs out. Oh! What a hit! That shoulder laid down on him. They come from all angles, pushing and jostling. That's what Grand Final footy's all about. It's all on the line. - Enough! - And that's 3/4 time. Torquay 10-7-67. It's a nail-biter. Where did we say they'd play? Scoreboard wing. - And are they? - Yes. What are we gonna do about it? - Go to the corridor. - Attack the guts! This is what we've been working for all year. Can you execute the plan? - Yes! - Then do it! Here comes the young man they call "Irish," Who resembles a human tank. He takes one bounce. In looking to take another one, evades a tackle, And now onto his trusty right foot. Kicks long into the forward line, And here comes Mortimer, Public enemy number one for the opposition. Number 23 proving a real headache. Directly in front, Mortimer goals! Reagan props, steadies, balances, kicks. It's a goal! Great kick from Reagan. Twenty-five possessions so far today. They're sure not missing Dunn out in the center today. They want it bad, these Tigers. Franky Tanner with great strength Gets in front of his fullback, takes a strong mark. He's just too strong for young Edwards. And it goals! And in typical Franky fashion, here he celebrates. I'm not sure Coach Chang would subscribe to the theatrics. "But who gives a stuff," says Franky, "If you get the job done?" You could only get this at grassroots footy. Handball to young Irish, spots something. It's Nicky Reagan on a strong move.

You know that you could win Brownlows If you weren't such a punk. Oh, so now I'm a punk. Well, yeah, you bludge, you're late, You're always stuffing around. It's obvious why Chang dumped you. You never give 100%. I heard him, and he said that he can't trust you. That lets the whole team down. I mean, he reckons that if you don't learn your lesson, You're never gonna get anywhere. - Is that right? - Yes. Take a look in the mirror and stop blaming everyone else. Bloody Chang. He thinks there's a lesson to be learned In everything. Who's at the door, Sammy? Maybe there is. Yeah. Right. Hey, Tommy. What you up to? Nothing. You? No. Look, I-I know this-this must seem a-a bit... I don't... - Good. - Oh. No. Good. Oh. Yeah, good. - It's good. - Then I'll see ya. See ya at, um... See ya at training, eh? - Yeah. - See ya.

Ah, hung up the boots last year. Still led the goals, though. But Chang wanted some new blood. Selfish. How's Dee? Dirty. And the kids? They play soccer. So was Chang sick? Right, this is the second semifinal. Carry and spread. Don't think that luck will get you through today. There's no such thing as luck. Luck is what's left when you've given everything you've got. So I want you to do it for... - Oh! - Dad? Do it for each other. So get ahold... Hey, Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! - Chang? Chang? - Dad, get up. - Back up. - Roll him over. Roll him over! He wanted it so bad, mate. It was our first Grand Final since you left. So you gonna come for a roll? You're lookin' at the new bronze-medal, Fourth-division champion. So if you only got bronze, how are you the champion? Count back. Look at that concentration. Nice, Franky. It's good to have you back, fella, Despite the circumstances, you know? Yeah, mate. I'm sorry I've been so hopeless staying in touch. Ah, you're all right. You're all right. Tommy? Tommy. - Hey. - Tommy! - How are ya? - Good, man. - Good to see ya. - Good to see you. - Hey, money bags. - Dude. This guy's a property developer now. Ka-ching. Land down here, who would've thought it? Just lucky, mate. Some guys at the Cats were putting in. Right place, right time. Play five games, hit the jackpot. Remember when Chang caught us having bongs in juniors? Yeah, he smacked me. So scared of him back then. - He can't do that anymore. - Bongs? - Hitting kids. - Didn't do it again, though. - Bongs? - Yes! - Good one, Tommy. - Oh! Ah, one down, Tommy. Franky's holding shot. ♪♪ ♪♪ All right. Who wants another? Shouldn't have asked, should I? Glad he's driving. Ah. Yeah, Chang once told me That he'd never seen a better kicker inside 30. Said I could've played AFL. In a different era. Hmm. It's tough to get noticed out here on the coast. Everyone's good inside 30, Franky, you dipstick. Jackie? He still nails 'em from 30, and he's 82. Well, I've seen him miss. And Chang, he was real good to me when I got delisted. Came and saw me in the hospital heaps, too. Yeah, he was proud of you. Yeah, real champion. Doped up on antidepressants. Mate, you played five more games Than the rest of us put together. You know, you did it. You did it. You played AFL. Yeah. Dude! I'll bring him over. I'll catch you later. Tom. Tom, wait up. Tom, we gotta let it go. Really? Instead of just... Instead of fighting to clear your name, You just walked out looking guilty. Is that right, is it? I'm sorry it happened. Are you sorry, or are you sorry it happened? You know, Sammy's age might have had everyone in a stir, But she wasn't a baby. I lost 13 years Because of some stupid photos in the newspaper. Yeah, don't forget the draft. The Cats would've come around. Yeah, okay, they got cold feet. But face it, you gave up. If that helps you sleep at night, mate, I never gave up. You forget that I lost everything that night too. I don't forget, okay? I think about what you did all the time. Thank you, everybody, for coming today... To celebrate an amazing life. Thanks for coming, everybody. So you think you might stay for a while? I don't know, Mum. - Mrs. Dunn... - Nick! You planning on stepping up from assistant coach To lead the boys in the Grand Final? I didn't know you're assistant coach. Tommy Dunn! Right now we're just here to pay our respects. Tommy, do you want to say a few words about Chang? - No, thanks. - We haven't heard from you... Sorry, guys. This is the wrong place! Okay. Take it easy. Barwon Heads, what a setting. The Tigers versus the Seagulls. First game back for the Tigers Since their big Grand Final victory in 2002. Looking back at the Tigers' bench, there's Wilson, Knights, And Tommy Dunn, selected for round one After his omission from the Grand Final. The ball's up. Nicky Reagan at ground level slickly picks it up, Dodges one, dodges two, onto his right foot. A long kick into the forward line. Mortimer! Did you see that? They've really gotta run it through Morts more. Morts? Morts, Morts, Morts! Getting a little obsessive, Sammy? Mortimer again, this time at ground level. Picks it up, steps. It's good! A goal! He's ripping this game apart. Let's give it to 'em, boys! A strong lead. It's Dunston with outstretched hands. Takes a strong mark. 35 meters out, directly in front. The conversion is absolutely perfect. Barwon Heads right back in the game. Nicky Reagan to Jack Didier. He kicks long. Franky caught behind. He's not chasing. What the hell was that? He really doesn't look like he's got his heart in it today. He's gotta give chase or he's off! As expected, he incurred the total wrath of Coach Chang. Clearly not a happy chappy. Franky, if you're not gonna chase him, Get off the bloody green. - I don't need to kick goals? - Just chase, mate. Try runnin' off with one nut, mate. Reagan up to Irish. Irish kicks long, finds Tanner. Tanner out in front this time! Takes a good mark. He bananas a goal. It's looking good! It's through the big uprights. He looks to Chang on the bench as if to say, "Stick that up your jumper!" Reagan handballs over to Franky Tanner. On his right foot, steps, a goal! Oh, in just a few minutes The big man has brought his presence into the game. Talk about swift redemption. And doesn't he love it! And don't the Barwon Heads fans just hate him! Dawson dodges one. Oh, he's gonna get run down. Hogue is gonna get him from behind! Hogue with a big tackle. Selfish play from Dawson. Pull him off. Looks like Dawson's getting dragged. No room in Chang's manual for that lazy selfish pride. Could Tommy Dunn get his first opportunity? Yep. Up steps Tommy Dunn. His first game since his omission in the Grand Final. Dunn's straight back into the thick of it. Strong tackle. Dunn again. Another strong tackle. Earns the free kick. That's all on the ball. The one-percenters from Tommy Dunn today Have been huge. Reagan on a long run. Dodges one or two, takes a bounce. Off the ball, Tommy Dunn! A huge shirtfront! And now a long kick to the forward line. Mortimer! A huge grab! Tommy Dunn at the pegs snaps a goal! Welcome back, Tommy Dunn! Dunn running back with the flight of the ball. Oh, what a courageous mark from Tommy Dunn. Backing into a pack, The toughest thing you can do in football. But I think he's injured himself fairly badly. It could be his ribs. Good courage, Tommy! The runners are heading out to him. I think they're calling for a stretcher. Hey. You okay? Please don't tell the boys I spewed. So I'm weaving left, I'm weaving right. Our mate kicks it long, but Tanner's leaping... Ohh! And he took a screamer, Which ultimately tubed the game for everybody. Well, if you were out there. - We won, didn't we? - My hero. I only played for 10 minutes. What no, hang on, Tommy. There was a fair bit of Cowboy tough. You won us the match. Well, debatable. Here. Who kicked the winning goal? Nicky Reagan. Who gave it to Nicky Reagan? - Oh, oh. - Irish. Sorry, Tommy. Sorry, buddy. Sorry. I hate you hanging out with those skanky girls. I'm... totally numb on painkillers. We'll see about that. - Yeah, you know. - It's a weird one. Sammy. What are you doing here? Uh, I was invited. - You're coming with me. - No, I'm not. Yeah, but you're not into her, are you? Dude, she's 15. Believe me, mate, I know. I'm copping hell. You wouldn't go there, right? Mate, she just likes hanging out. It's harmless. Okay. Come on, mate. Give me five more. Tommy, Chang's boys, Scott and Glenn. All grown up. - How are you? - Hello. - How you doin', mate? - Hey. I remember you. You played for Dad. Yeah. 1998 to 2003, yeah? Dad loved you. Yeah, he'll be... He'll be missed. Especially on Saturday. Well, at least you've got Nick here. Oh, I'm an assistant, not the coach. You're kidding, right? You gotta step up. Okay. I'll step up if you and Morts are my assistants. I am sorry. Really, I am sorry. Yeah, I know, mate. No, you don't. I apologized. We shook hands. Said we'd be mates. Haven't spoken since. - What? - No. Chicks are right, you know? Guys are bloody hopeless. Hey, you wanna have a kick? You remember where the lights are? I reckon we can find 'em. Evening, ladies! Oh, Franky! Somebody order a cocktail? Oh! Oh-ho-ho! Tom's still got it! Tommy! I'm not getting that! Franky, it's your turn, buddy. Normally I would, but... I think I pulled a hammy delivering that bullet pass. I'll get it. Oh, I gotta stop having Midori and milk. Ohh! Welcome to Ron Evans Oval down here in Portarlington, A club steeped in rich history. The only team playing better than the Tigers this year Is the Demons. The winner will go straight through to the Grand Final And, of course, get the all-important week off. Peters with the quick tap, but the Tigers move it forward. Dawson out with a strong mark. Plays it off to Dunn. Dunn with a kick inside 50. A bouncing ball to Tanner. Franky runs around, this-a-away, that-a-away, And all of a sudden he's caught. He took far too long. Brown's got him. Anderson runs off. He's quick too. One bounce and kicks it out of defense. The ball spills out of the back. The extra man, Harvey, picks it up, steps. It's a goal! It's a cheapie, but doesn't he love it. He loves to chat as well. See you, Dunny! Jack Didier handball to Tommy Dunn. Dunn with the quick reply. And what a great comeback year Dunn is having. He's probably leading the Tigers' best and fairest. At 3/4 time, Portarlington have a strong lead. Tigers will need to lift. I want next Saturday off! Straight through to the Grand Final. Switch to man-on-man. Pile on the forward pressure. I want three tackles out of each of you. - Right? - Yes! Let's do this! Go on! Hey. Tag 17. He's killing us. Get physical with him. Go on. Dunn given the huge assignment To quell the influence of the Demons' best footer, Harvey, If the Tigers are to have any chance of victory And the coveted week off. Robbo with the tap. Didier sharks it, handballs it to Dunn. A pack forms. Players rummaging at ground level. The boundary throw-in. Robbo down to Dunn. A fierce tackle from Farrell. Demons on the rebound. Ball bouncing down to the pocket. Great shepherd from Irish! Allows Tanner to wheel around on his right foot, Slots it through. First we've seen of Tanner today. He's been very quiet, the big fella. Robbo off the Nicky Reagan fumble. Recovers well. Kicks long to the forward line. And out comes Mortimer! A strong mark. From 40 meters out, lines it up purposely And slots it through. Another nice goal from Mortimer. The Tigers are back in this. Tanner picks up the crumb, Tries to crash his way through the pack. Can't do it. Mugsy Ryan pulls him down. - Ugly by name, ugly by nature. - Bloody hell. Harvey and Dunn jostle for position in the goal square, Both using their bodies. Oh, it's over the back. Harvey, strong goal. By my calculations, that's number seven. And Harvey, there's a crush. Pushes Tommy Dunn in the back. Seven big ones. He's killed Dunn in the last quarter. He has pulled his proverbial stripes down. The Demons are running away with this one. The Tigers are gonna have to play a lot better next week To earn a spot in their second consecutive Grand Final. Oh, here he is. Hey, great tag today, mate. You really shut me down out there. No, I really hope you ladies win next week. I'd love to see you in the granny. Oh, that's if you get picked for the team, that is. Tommy... Tommy! You don't want to get pumped twice in one day, do you? ♪ Yellow and black ♪ Yes, we're from Tigerland You'll get him next time. Won't be a next time if I don't get picked. What happened? Played like shite. Oh, well. The world still turns. It was a semifinal. Welcome to the Preliminary Final. We're playing here at Anglesea, home to the Anglesea Kangaroos. The winner of this game is bound for the Grand Final. Instant elimination for the loser. Here we go. And the ball's up in the air. Engel sends the tap to Stevens. Dunn takes him down. To Mills. Hesitates. Irish and Dawson bring him down. A great gang tackle. Evans tries to clear. Great smother, Tommy Dunn. Reagan, a quick handball to Dunn. Dunn wheels around on his right foot. And Franky Tanner takes a great mark. Déjà vu for Edwards. He had a nightmare in last year's Grand Final, And Franky's doing it to him again. You like that? Sammy, come here. Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea, wait up, wait up. As long as you're writing down numbers. I don't know. - Call me anytime, yeah. - Really? Really, yeah You're the only goal I haven't scored. Irish slides on the ground. Tap to Dunn. Dunn to Reagan. Nicky Reagan. And Tanner again with superb body movement Has taken a strong mark. Lines up from an angle and slots it through. There's no stopping the Vaudeville act here this afternoon. Morts comes in off the boundary. Edwards taken down. Dawson swoops. Goal! Great tackle for Morts. Allowed Dawson to swoop and convert it. Torquay has full control of this game. Tommy Dunn running down the wing, looks up. Kicks. Out on the full. A shocking kick. Half the thought of missing out on Grand Final selection again Could be weighing heavily upon him. He's had a great year, but not a great Finals campaign. Center bounce. Robbo with the tap. Stevens the other way. The old one-two with Mills. Mills, the handball back to Stevens. Stevens kick... Coppola! Unselfishly handballs into an open goal by Anglesea. A great team goal. Boundary throw-in. Pats it down. Great snap. Another one for Francis Ford. Dunn attacks the ball. Oh, Fitz is down! They come from everywhere. I'm sure he was going the ball, but it didn't look great. A 50-meter penalty. Chang's not gonna be happy with that. Another goal to Anglesea. A great effort to get up and take that hit by Fitzgerald. The ball's up... Siren time. That's it. The Tigers have done it. They were hungry for this one. We're going to the big dance, Charlie. Congratulations. Ha All right. Forwards: Knights, Mortimer, Milkey, Tanner, Young, Barry. Followers: Robbo... Reagan, Pitcher, And Dunn. Interchange... Yeah, you said it. Hey, Tommy. I'll see you at Franky's. Thanks, Chang. I didn't do you any favors, son. You proved yourself. You better stop that prick next week, though. All right. No pressure. Hey, another big one this weekend, Nick? Yeah. You gotta coach 'em, Nicky. Yeah, I said I would... If Tommy and Morts were assistants. What about me, you dog? I need an extra hand running water, too? Yeah, I'm up. Yeah, all right, me too. You dogs. Training tomorrow at eight. Eight? Hey, does anyone know where Rose lives? - Why do you ask? - Is that a no? - No, don't go there, mate. - After you, Coach. I believe you. Uh, hi. Hi. I was looking for Rose. She moved out years ago. She's on Vine, number 14. Okay. All right. Thanks. Hey, uh... I saw you at the ceremony. It's good you came back for it. Tom, would you come in for a minute? - I have to get going. - Just for a minute? Dad's asleep. Don't have to worry. Why would I be worried? No, I mean... You still live here? Just moved back from Melbourne. I finished Uni, and Dad's been sick. Look, it's... It's nice to see you, but I should really get going. Maybe another time then. Not here, but we could... Listen, you seem to be doing great, but, um... I have to go. Hi. How'd you get this address? I went to your old house. Sammy gave it to me. You saw Sammy? What are you doing here, Tom? I was just hanging out with the boys. - Are you drunk? - No. What? You know, you and I... We would never have... We were kids. Look, I never left. I haven't gotten anywhere. - What? That's fine. - I'm not doing what I planned. But you know what? I'm happy. Great. You're happy. I've moved on. You know, I ran into Cowboy's mom last week. She told me that for so long... She didn't understand football. When Cowboy was a kid, he was out every night, every weekend, Out in the field kicking around a ball. "My son could be doing more with his life." That's what she thought. It wasn't until she lost Cowboy... In the accident. And an abundance of players... Good, caring, driven blokes... There were lots of you, she said, Came out of the woodwork, Gave her a hand, Fixing up the car, bringing in the shopping, Sharing a yarn about her son. It wasn't until then That she appreciated what football's about. When his teammates started to behave like a family, She realized that her son... Was part of something more. He was part of a team. Cowboy was tough. There were none tougher. He concentrated... For four quarters every game. He was at the bottom of the pack every time there was a contest. He tackled with intent every time. And if there was a blue, he was always at your back. You could count on it. And most of the time he was doing that With a dislocated shoulder or a couple of broken fingers. He typified courage. He was tough. He was Cowboy tough. And that's what I want from you today. I want every one of you to be bloody Cowboy tough. They all know the game plan. I've talked to you individually. We man up tight when they've got the pill. You break off fast and make a play As soon as there's a turnover, And we force those turnovers with ferocious bloody tackling. Right, I want you all to take a seat. Come on. Boys, bring it in nice and tight. Watertight, watertight. Pull up a bit of floor. Keep it quiet. I want you to close your eyes. Go on, close your eyes. I want you to imagine something. Picture this: A mother. Your mother. Could be your sister. Anyone who's brought a child into the world. Picture that child. Little face. A smile. The happiness. Now picture some vicious bastard Who wants to take that child off her. He's pushed her, He's backhanded her in the face, And he is trying to take that child. Can you picture that? Yes. There is no way That she's going to let him take that child. She will find an inner strength, A mental strength she never knew she had. She's going to fight tooth and nail. She will die rather than let that bastard take that child, And she will not lose. You've seen it in the animal world, And it's in our world too. A superhuman strength. I want you to take that strength And get out there and rip this game apart! Have you got it in you? - Yes, sir! - Get out there! Welcome to Spring Creek Reserve in Torquay, The scene for today's 2003 Grand Final Between archenemies the Torquay Tigers And the Portarlington Demons. The Torquay fans will be eager to see their side Win their first-ever back-to-back premiership. But I gotta tell you what. From my observation, These Demons have looked harder and faster And the better side all year. Well, certainly these young Tigers have earned it, Sam. Tommy Dunn runs to Harvey. A bit of a surprise move, Considering the toweling that Harvey gave Dunn two weeks ago, But Chang's backed his man. The bounce. Robbo with the tap, but only as far as Riggs. Harvey gets the handball. Dunn with a great tackle! What an important start for Tommy Dunn. The ball up in the air. Irish runs onto it, runs for the middle. Puts boot to ball. A long kick. And Tanner with great poise and positioning takes the mark. Lines it up directly in front, and he goals. First point for the Tigers. What a ripping start. And don't they just love him here? He has folk hero status. The bouncing ball in the square. Dawson with a scissor kick. Goal! Back in the center, Farrell down to Riggs, Back to Farrell, quickly to Turner. Quick kick into the forward line. Anderson! The ball up, 15 meters out. Campbell reaching up the pack, snaps. A goal! The Demons are fighting back. The ball loose in the pocket. Handball comes out to Harding. Dunn manhandles him out of the way. Handballs to Tanner. Franky steps another goal. The Tigers celebrate. Yeah! Harvey battles for position, handballs to Campbell. Campbell bursts through the center, takes one bounce. Oh, Anderson at the back, steps. Goal. Demons take the front. Running hard, Dawson finds Reagan. Blind turns, presses through a pack. Reagan gets the handball up to Irish. Irish kicks long. Mortimer! What a courageous mark by Mortimer. Lines it up and goal. The ball up on the square. Robbo taps it down. Gibbs pounces on the ball, falls to Didier, Over to Bishop, finds Irish, back inside to Dunn. He's run strongly. Inside 50. Franky Tanner presents himself and takes a strong mark. Great play by the Tigers. Tanner's having a field day today. That's the aggression he needs to bring for the Tigers To be able to win the big one. The bounce down. Farrell down to Gibbs, to Foley, back to Gibbs. 1-2 to Frawley. Frawley kicks long. Harvey lurking at the back. Harvey on a chest, takes a mark and goals. Harvey hasn't made a strong today, But the Demons are leading the way. They celebrate, the Demons, a two-goal lead nevertheless. Reagan shepherds Harvey out. Dunn bolts from the back line. Another strong shepherd from the Tigers. Dunn kicks. Finds Dawson. Dawson runs in. Tommy's run on. Dunn slots another goal. This is the best we've seen for years. Gut-busting run from Tommy Dunn. But the Demons hold a three-goal lead Going into the 3/4 time. Do you want to remember this moment? Yes! Do you want to be able to tell your kids What you did out there today? Yes! Unselfish acts. That's what I want. What price are you prepared to pay To win back-to-back flags? Write yourself into the history of this great club. Can you do it? Yes! Give me everything! We believe in you! They have not stepped up to our level! And you know why? Because we have got it! We have got what it takes to be the premiership team. Look at all these people behind us. They are here to see us do it. Come on! Let's get out there, boys! Come on, boys! Nicky Reagan running at the ball, Sits aloft the pack to take a huge mark. The Tigers fans are going nuts. Reagan kicks from 40. It's good! The Tigers are only one goal down. The boundary tap, the ball straight to Harvey. Fends off, handballs to Coen, Feigns a handle, dodges a tackle. Left foot goal! Ball bounces in. Frawley hesitates. Ooh! Tanner's got him from behind! Great rundown. Great desperation from Tanner. Tanner directly in front, kicks, converts. Another goal for Franky. The Tigers have drawn level. Inside five minutes to play. The crowd on their feet. The ball up in the air. Farrell gets a tap only as far as Reagan. Farrell spoils, picks it up, dishes to Gibbs. Gibbs kicks long. Defensive ball hits the ground. Anderson swoops, kicks. Another goal to Anderson! That's the Demons back on top by five points, Sam. Harvey picks up the loose ball. Great tackle! Dunn's clearly had the better of Harvey today. Ow! It feels really like next goal will win. Tigers need a goal. Farrell taps the ball down to Harvey, and he's away. - What's wrong with Tommy? - I don't know. Harvey gets on his bike. He bolts down the wing. He's looking for a teammate, beckons Riggs to come forward. Riggs obliges. He handballs to Riggs. Returns back to Harvey. Dunn's sprinting down the ground, But he's miles behind him. No one's coming at him. Harvey realizes he's got space galore in front of him. Cuts inside 50. He's still going, he's lining it up, Gonna try for goal. Dunn from nowhere! The perfect smother! A premiership defining moment. Yes! Reagan pounces on the loose ball. Reagan on the rebound. They're coming in from everywhere. 20 seconds left. Go, go! He takes another bounce. He feigns a handball. He raises his eyes, looks for a leader forward. Mortimer's the obvious target. He puts foot to ball. And Mortimer's got it! He's got it! - Mortimer has got the ball. - Yes! 10 seconds left. He'll need this goal for the win. It's come down to this. One last kick. What courage from Dunn. What pressure on the young man. Mortimer, the weight of the entire club On his broad shoulders. He comes in, a tight angle. Bananas. It's a goal! A goal! The Tigers win back-to-back flags. The crowd goes nuts! The Tigers all run at Mortimer. They've done it. That smother by Tommy Dunn will go down in history. The kids storm the ground, And it's pandemonium down here at Spring Creek, Sam. What a comeback from Dunn. That smother will go down in footballing folklore. What a famous victory. Chang's brought them a second premiership in as many years. They lift Mortimer high, AFL bound. He won't be the only one. You'd think Nicky Reagan, Tommy Dunn, and Mortimer Are headed for professional football. Fantastic game! Oh, mate, you played a blinder!

All right, let's do it! Come on, boys! Come on! Come on, fellas, get in there! - What are you doing here? - Saw your car. Shouldn't you be at the game? What do you care? We need to talk. For the first time in 10 years, We're back at Spring Creek Reserve To see the Torquay Tigers in a Grand Final. And it's a somber occasion as coach Charlie Chang Hyde Passed away last week. Ex-Tigers captain and club legend Nicky Reagan Has stepped up to coach. Alongside him, Tommy Dunn as his assistant. The 2003 champions are in the coaches' box today. Dunn, of course, hasn't been back here since that scandal That ruined, well, a lot of people's lives. Today the Tigers take on Ocean Grove, And the Swans are the hot favorites. Four more wins than the Tigers this season. But Torquay are playing for Chang today, And the whole town is behind them. And we're away. Sully with a strong tap, intercepted by Bennett. And Decker with a hard hit on Bennett! What a rib-tickler. The ball rebounds to Decker. Kicks forward. Riddle! A strong mark to Nick Riddle. Riddle lines it up, converts. Ocean Grove on top. Hyde running hard, takes possession. Oh, he's taken down hard by Lowell. Where's the toll? Scotty Hyde on a strong lead. Marks. Goal! He's playing for his father today. Gives the Tigers a chance. And their fans have really become animated. Hit towards goal. Off hands, Durkin squibs, Durkin goals! Ocean Grove's strength Is just becoming slightly more pronounced now. Keep going. Alright plenty of time left, mate. We need you to lift. Keep going, lads, keep going. Yeah, Harding, keep it up. Just gotta keep presenting, and we'll get it to work. I wanted to come this morning and say stuff to you. I think I've just always been so embarrassed That I couldn't... So I'm at the pub, right? And Rose pops up. And what she said should've made me really angry, But it didn't. And that feels good. What? What did she say? Sammy didn't give the photos to the paper. Rose did. It wasn't you. What? The photos in the paper. Why did you apologize the other night? Please don't be angry. No, I just don't get it, I just don't get it. Everybody thought it was me anyway, So why put Rose in the firing line? I guess she was trying to teach us a lesson, and it backfired. Sorry. I'm in idiot. Hey, you're not... Not an idiot. Gotta go. Go. The Tigers are three goals down, But you get the feeling it's not beyond them. That said, Ocean Grove are looking quicker and stronger, And they're going to be very, very hard to beat. Here's the bounce. It's Sully with the tap, down to Shore, to Cook. Cook to Smith. Nice hit by Banner! What a bone cruncher! Thames with a handball to Hyde, then Hyde bursting through, Kicks long to his brother Scotty Hyde! What a great combination. Hyde kicks, crowd waits. A great goal! First point for the Tigers in the second half. Ocean Grove seem to have all the answers, Sam, But the Tigers are hitting it hard. Handball back to Brian Shore, wrapped up in two tackles. Great work from the Tigers. They're ferocious at the ball. Decker kicks. Riddle on a strong lead. Nick Riddle slots through another. They think that they've got us, But we are younger and fitter than them. So we're gonna play the ball wide. Don't center up until you hit the half-forward flank, And then send it through to Scotty Hyde all day long. Those bastards haven't got the legs. - Are you up for it? - Yes! Grab a jumper! - Come on, get in. - Listen up, boys. I know some of you are hurting, But when you walk off the Grand in 30 minutes time Holding a Premiership cup, You'll remember this day for the rest of your lives. Success today is about giving your best. Commit to that, and you'll walk tall No matter where you are, okay? Now, today is about bleeding for your teammates For 30 more minutes. It's about hurting like you've never hurt before And finding more in you. Now, when the final whistle goes and we've won, You can look at your teammates in the eye, Knowing that you went that extra yard. Now don't let yourselves down! Don't let Chang down! Get out there! Get out there! The boundary throw-in. Wallace with the tap-down. Gibson over the top. Scotty Hyde bangs through another! That's four goals to Hyde. All the Tigers need now is a spark. They're right back in this. Sully wins the tap, down to Shore, Then Baker in turn, who kicks long. With this one score here, it could well and truly be over. A great intercepted pass by Fields, however. He passes on to Barber, chips it over to Glenn Hyde, Who picks it up, and he's off. He handballs over the top to Cordy. Cordy in turn gives it back to him. Go long! Scotty Hyde's on a lead. The big question is will he spot him. Use your fucking brother! Glenn kicks. He's got it! What a play by the Hyde brothers. Those boys have played tremendously well today. Scotty, listen up. This could turn the game. If you kick it through the middle, we'll get a goal. Okay? All the pressure in the world on this young man's shoulders. He governs the entire destiny of the side. Very purposely walks in And very deliberately kicks the goal! A goal! A goal! They've done it! Nice one, Scotty! That's my boy! Come on, boys, get it done! Yes! We did it!
