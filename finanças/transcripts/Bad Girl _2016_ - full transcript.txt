I can't find it anywhere. All that's in here are towels. Charles. What? What does that say? - Towels. - Yeah. You know what, as a matter of fact, you know what I want you to do? I want you to go into that box that says dishes, and get some dishes, because breakfast is gonna be ready shortly. How many towels does a kitchen need, anyway? Oh, some are for use and others are for decorations. Decorative towels, don't you think that's a waste of money? Babe. We should be able to live a little. Okay? I mean, there's nothing wrong with having nice things. You know I grew up with little. You know, now that I have, I should be able to live a little, and so should you. Melinda, you need to be reminded that this congregation is gonna hold us to a higher standard. For we aim to not only do what's right in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 2 Corinthians. I know, you're right. Doesn't mean I have to like it. Found the dishes. The toast and the bacon'll be ready shortly. Okay. Where's our daughter? Where do you think? Ruth! Babe, it's the last day of school, cut her some slack. Ease up on her just a little bit. Well, either you're gonna be a parent or a buddy, but you can't be both. At least one of us understands that. Again with the throwing of the plates? Don't you think you keep overreacting? I mean, I haven't said anything you haven't already heard. I'm not going to be told by you or anybody else how to raise my daughter. And secondly, I don't care what those heifers at the church say, I'm gonna be the woman that I want to be. As a matter of fact, ever since you have taken this position, Charles, you have changed, and not all for the better. - Melinda? - Yes. Why don't you take a deep breath and count to 10 before you say something you may regret. Better yet, why don't you go and get our daughter. She will be down in a second. And you know she likes to be called Quinn. Well, I named her Ruth, that's a good Godly name, so that's the name I'm gonna use. Ruth! I'm here, I'm here. Shouldn't you save your voice for Sunday service? Come on, let's have a seat. Sit down and eat this breakfast that your mother prepared. Let's pray. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for our family, we thank you for this food that we are about to receive, and we thank you for... Baby, are you excited about the last day of school? I'm more excited about tomorrow. First day of summer vacation. Ah, you got big plans? Maybe. Babe, do you know where they put the box with the books in them, I can't find them anywhere! Why don't you look at the one that's... Oh, I just found it. It was in the box labeled books. Yeah. You ready for me to take you to school? Mom, can I please drive the car today? Oh, honey, I got a million things to do, I mean, we're not even settled in yet, and those women are gonna be coming here to drop by and you know how those people at church like to gossip, especially those females, can I get a what what? Okay, would you please act your age? You are only as old as you feel and look. Sorry. Yeah. I'll go get my stuff, I'll be down. So much to do. All right, my dear. Hi! Hey! Oh my gosh, okay, so I have to tell you, you're never going to believe this, you know Sammie? With that mole thing? Well, yesterday... Good morning, Cassie! Good morning, Mrs. Robinson. And how are you this morning? Oh, well, any day above the ground's a good one, right? Right! You are totally wearing that outfit. Ah, well you know I do. I have to go shopping with you, I need, like, that, and that, and that... Yeah, I'll definitely take you shopping. Okay, girls, G2G. Hey, mom, how am I gonna get home? Oh, I can make sure she gets home. Oh, okay. All right, well then I'll see you later. Bye, beautiful! Congratulations! Last day of school, woo woo! Can I get a what what! Your mom is so cool. I mean, she's not all stuffy like most moms. Yeah, so cool. Hey, Cassie. How are you gonna get me home when you ride the bus? Uh... Wait! I have to tell you about Sammie! Ah, it's my favorite time of year, Sister Battle. Yes, the Lord has blessed us with a heat this summer that should not be wasted. Ah, hey Deacon. Hey, Althea. Hey, Sister Battle. Hi. I don't know, I've been thinking about doing something different this summer. Well, different can be good. That's what I'm thinking, something fresh and exciting. - Yes! - Challenging. Maybe even a little risky. Yes! Instead of a summer play, let's put on a talent showcase. What, you don't like that idea? It's not bad, it's just that, I just thought that... You know, Deacon, I think that's an excellent idea. See? See, thank you, Althea. Hey, Sis. Oh, hey, what's up? Hey, Melinda. Hey, Deacon Bacon... Am I interrupting something? Oh, nonsense, no, Sister Battle and I are just discussing our summer camp activities. Well, if that's all, then... That's all. All right, well then, can I steal you for a second, please? Oh, sure, sure, sure. Ow! Deacon! Are you, are you all right? I'm, I'm fine. This desk is a little shorter than what I'm used to. Just give me a minute. No, don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. No, are you sure? Yes, yes. He who finds me finds a good thing. Remember that. Now, go with our First Lady. Lord love a cheerful giver. What? Oh, nothing, Sister. Are you okay? I'm fine, it's just that man! You better watch out for that one, Deacon. Who, Sister Battle? - Yes. - Oh, she's just a good Christian woman who loves her church. What? For as long as I've known you, you have always had a blind spot. I may be a little clumsy, but I don't see what that has to do with anything. - Okay. - What? You just haven't changed since the day I met you. Yeah, well, neither have you. And Charles is lucky to have you. Yeah. Everything okay? He's your friend. You tell me. Yeah, well, you are my friend, too. What's going on? Yeah, I, we've just been a part of this church for a long time, and he's moved from the Youth Ministry up to the head of the church, so, why wouldn't everything be fine? You sure. Of course. I'm the good wife, right? Oh, wait a minute now. You know what? I gotta get to this meeting. So I will talk to you later. Okay, we'll chat. All right... I know we're all excited about leaving for summer break, but before we do, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge an accomplishment. Miss Robinson, would you please stand? It's come to my attention that your father has been called to pastor the congregation of Calvary Baptist Church, so let's all offer her our warm congratulations. Now I want you all to have a wonderful summer, and be safe. I'll see you back in the fall. Thank you for a good year. Congrats. Have a good one. I don't know how you do it. I would be mortified if I was just singled out like that in front of everyone. Hey, Quinn. Hey, Eric. Have a great summer, Quinn. You too... Hey. We should get together this summer. Tommy, I don't think my boyfriend would like that. Okay. I know everyone loves you and everything, but seriously, if they were all staring at me like that, I would just die. Yeah, like seriously, just, quit breathing. Just, beep, beep, beep. Flat line. Dead. Cassie, you're exaggerating. Okay, well, maybe not die die, but I would probably pee my pants. Yeah. I know, not really ladylike, right? Although, what am I saying, if you peed your pants, you would probably get an award. What? You know I always take the blame for anything you do wrong. What are we gonna do? Oh, I didn't even do anything, and I'm gonna get charged with conspiracy after the fact. Oh, why did you have to tell me what you did? You know, this is going to go on my record and colleges look at that stuff! Relax, okay, look, they don't have proof. Plead ignorance, you'll be okay. Miss Donahue? Ignorance. Miss Robinson, do you want to tell me what happened? I really don't know anything, Principal Decker. Ruth, how long have I known you? Um, I don't know, for, like, ever? Since you were a little girl in my Sunday School class, right? Your parents and I shared the same church for a long time. So I've watched you grow from a little girl into a smart, honest young woman. You can tell me the truth. It was Cassie, wasn't it. I am telling you the truth, I really don't know anything, Principal Decker. Honest. I hope Miss Donahue realizes what a good friend she has in you. But let me tell you something about friendship. Sometimes, you have to be there for your friend. But then sometimes, you need to allow her to be accountable for her actions. You have to decide what's right at the proper time. It's all about growing up, being mature. You understand? I do, but... Tell Miss Donahue she has one week's detention. Wait, but... That's it. You're dismissed. See you on Sunday. So, what are you gonna do this summer? No, wait, wait, wait, let me guess. Hmm. Hanging out with Roman? I hope so. It's gonna be so much harder now, since we moved. We used to live in the same apartments, now we're like seven miles away. Seven miles is not that far. Okay, with a car, no. But if you ask me, my dad moved us on purpose. He doesn't like Roman. Is it 'cause he's not at a Christian school? Maybe. Mmm. Yeah. Those public school boys, so worldly. Not like all these, all immature. Yeah. Plus, he's quarterback, and all muscle-y... Okay, Cassie. Sorry. Okay, I have to go see him. I'm gonna drop you off, you want a ride? Uh, sure, yeah. Um, hmm, yeah, on second thought, I think I'll take the bus. Okay. Good idea. I cannot believe you wanted me to ride that bus. Hey, it's my yellow limo! So, Roman. Now that school's over, you finally gonna ask me out? You know, Tonya's been dying for us to double with her and Chris. Come on, Roman, it'll be fun. Watch. You like fun, don't you? You're wasting your time. He's already got a girlfriend. Yeah, she's right. Roman got himself a bible baby from that Christian school over there. Is that true? Are you in love with a church girl? Would you like me to wait on you, Ruth-Quinn? Maggie. We've been over this. It's just Quinn. Right, I'm sorry. I'm so forgetful. So, should I wait? No. I think I got it from here. Thanks. Okay, Quinn! I'll see you Sunday. Yes, I have a girlfriend. And yes, she goes to a Christian school. But there's more to it than that. I mean, does she treat you right? Does she make you feel good? 'Cause you know, I bet I could make you feel real good. Yeah, she, ah, she... - Hey, Roman. - Oh, Ruth! Excuse me. Chris, I'll holler at you later, man. Sure, man. Have fun. I mean, are you not gonna introduce us to your friends, Roman? No, not really. So, you're the famous Quinn? I'm not sure how famous I am, but yeah, Quinn's my name. Your dad used to be Youth Minister at church, right? Yeah, that's him. Your dad is really nice, and your mom is super cool. She even gave me her cell phone number in case I needed to talk to someone about God. - Amber. - She's a really good friend. You don't need any lame hotline when you have us. Uh, yeah, that sounds like her. Well, I really have to get going, it was nice talking to you guys. You know, I bet she doesn't even know what fun is. I mean, she probably thinks she better than us, too. Don't worry. He'll be bored with her in no time. Girls like that have nothing on us. Isn't that right, baby? That's what I tried to tell him. Right answer. Tell him, tell him you're staying at a friend's house, and that she'll drop you off at church in the morning. You want me to lie to my dad? Are you playing innocent with me, Ruth? Look, I know you're the apple of everyone's eye. But you forget that I know you. You like to dance along the line. So, tomorrow, come play on my side. What if he checks? Why would he? You're his perfect little girl. Besides, Cassie would lie for you. That girl worships you. She doesn't worship me. She's just a good friend. So you'll come? I guess so. You guess? Yes. Great. Come in! Hey, isn't it a little late for spring cleaning? Ha ha. I wanted to see if you wanted to help out, your mother wanted to have a movie night, but I see you're right in the middle of something, I think I'll let you get back to it. - Hey, dad. - Yes? Is it okay if I spend the night at Cassie's house tomorrow? Her mom can drop me off at church on Sunday. Are you gonna be at church on time? I promise. Of course you can. Thanks, Dad. Wow. You like it? I like. Church girl. Is that you? Daddy let you come out to play with us heathens looking like that? You know what we need, Roman? You know, Roman makes the best drinks. Just wait till you try one. She's not much of a drinker, Kaye. You don't have to if you don't want to. It's a party, church girl. Leave the bible at home. One drink ain't never gonna hurt you. I don't know. Oh! Are we praying or are we drinking? You know it's not a party unless I got a drink in my hand. That's right, baby. It's not art. Don't just stare at it. Drink it. Even little Amber can do it. Aw, she's scared! Aw, it might hurt the first time. But it feels better and gets easier the more you do it. Girl, you are so bad! I gotta be. Good girls are boring. Oh! Shots! Shots! Shots! Drink! Drink! Yeah! May I have another one? Woo, bible baby's gone wild! Um, maybe we should go somewhere a little more quiet. I'd like that. Maybe she's not that boring. We'll see about that. Let me see you phone, Amber. Hi, Mrs. Robinson. May I speak to Pastor Robinson, please? Hey, that is really low. Hi, Pastor Robinson. I know you don't know me. I wanted to call and tell you about your daughter. Yeah, she's at a party where kids are drinking and having sex. Oh, you want the address? Sure. Maybe you should slow down. You've got nothing to prove. Come dance with me, Roman. Maybe you should sit down here. You don't have to go get her, Charles. She's a good girl, we taught her properly, you gotta learn how to trust her. Melinda, did you hear what I said? There's alcohol and boys at that party, she is not where she's supposed to be, she lied to me, she lied to us. And you want me to trust her? Yes, I want you to trust her. And can you blame her? You keep this tight rope around her, you never give her any freedom, you suffocate her. I mean, you have to allow her to have a little bit of fun, you do remember what fun is... She's 16 years old. Not now, Melinda. Not now? Not now. Okay, so then, when. Huh? What happened to that guy that was fun and romantic and spontaneous? He became a father, he became a pastor. He's a man with different responsibilities now. Yes, I know that you have responsibilities. I have responsibilities... Where are my keys? But what I'm asking you, as your wife, is to trust her. That party is no place for a pastor's daughter. I bet you it was that Cassie that talked her into going there. It was that Cassie! You know what? I am so glad that you are on your way to that camp for the summer, because I need a break, I don't even know if I can even do this anymore. I am going to get our daughter, and I'm gonna bring her back home. And I don't want to hear another word about it! You don't want to hear... Who do you think you're talking to, huh? I am very disappointed in you, Ruth. It was just a party. If it were just a party, you would've told me about it. But Daddy. If I... Daddy nothing. Look at you, you're drunk. Is that the kind of influence that this boy has over you? He has a name, Daddy. It's Roman, and I love him. Is that what you thought you were doing? Loving him? We were only kissing. In a cubbyhole, Ruth. Alone, Ruth. Do you think that was the right thing to do, Ruth? What's so wrong about it? The bible says, act properly as in the day. Not in carousing and drunkenness, or sexual promiscuity. Sensuality. Strife and jealousy. Romans 13:13. We weren't gonna do it. I knew you and that boy were getting too close. I thought the move was enough. But if you think that you're gonna sit under him for the rest of the summer, you can guess again. Daddy. You're not saying that I'm gonna have to stay... You are going to the summer camp with me, and you're gonna be a counselor. But Daddy, I, I have stuff... We are gonna go home, get you into bed, and get you ready for church in the morning. This conversation is over, young lady. Excellent sermon, Pastor. I knew you had it in you. Oh, thank you. Hopefully the first of many. Oh, it will be. That was awesome. Pastor, your daughter's voice is a blessing from heaven. Each time I hear her sing I know that God is truly good. - Yes He is, all the time. - Amen. Mmm, I love it when you make me look good. To God be given the glory. Oh, of course. Praise Him. Congrats, big brother. I'm proud of you. Thanks, sis. But you know, nothing that is said up there comes directly from me. I know, but you sure put on one great presentation. Thank you. And Quinn. You sure do give your auntie goosebumps while you're up there. Thanks, Auntie A. It's this little one who does all the work. I just mouth the words, ain't that right, kiddo? Now, I understand you're gonna be joining us as a counselor this summer. Yes. Well what better than to serve your fellow man, right? Ah, sis, could you take Quinn and tell her a little bit more about the camp program? Certainly, certainly, I can do that, come on. Mary. Chase. Charles Robinson. Look at you, all grown up and a successful pastor. What are you doing on this side of the tracks? From what I heard, you died of a venereal disease. Melinda. Melinda, you are funny as ever. And I see you still have your sense of humor, Charles. All right, let's keep it civil, kids. Mary, what can we do for you out here? Well, I'm back in town visiting my mother, and I just wanted to see if the old church was still here, but I see it's not as old as I remember it. Mary. I'm sure you're no stranger to overhauling old, distressed objects. Charles. Pastor. Excuse me, Pastor. Could I have a word with you? In private. Fine. Pastor? My mother is dying. And I need to make her final arrangements. Charles, I will be inside. Okay. I'll be right in. Mary, now what is it that you really want? Why do I have to want something? Because your mother died when we were in school. You remember that? I'm a very busy man with a lot of responsibilities, Mary, I don't have time for this. Honestly? Charles. I missed you. I just wanted to see you. Mary. That was a long time ago. Okay? I'm sorry, but I have to go. God bless you. It's getting off to a good start. I think it's gonna be a great summer. Yes sir. We've got some great kids coming, and we really appreciate the two of you volunteering to work with these young people. You know, they need role models. Well, we're here. Yay. Your sarcasm is unnecessary, Ruth. You should have some fun here. I don't see how. I'm being forced to spend the summer away from my friends, away from Roman... This will be good for you. Maybe you can use this time to think about the choices that you made that got you here. Dad, it's not fair. Why isn't Mom here enjoying this fun? Because she wanted time alone and away from the church. But Daddy, I bet you she would've... Okay. Good. Now let's go. Well, Pastor Robinson. Did you have any problems getting here? You ask me that same question every year, and every year the answer's the same. I don't know why you do it. Oh, you know why, but that's a story for another time. Let me introduce you to two of our counselors, you remember Jessie? Right, good to see you again. And this is Alex, he's a first timer. It's a pleasure to meet you, Pastor Robinson. You have a lot of energy. Yes sir. Alex, let go, you might pull off the pastor's hand. Not a problem, this is my daughter, Ruth, she's a first timer as well. Call me Quinn. Now, is Ruth gonna be the only female counselor here? Oh, no, no, no, we have a late volunteer. Where is she? Quinn! Mmm, you two are friends! Um, best friends. Well, that's a good thing. So listen, why don't you young people go and get yourselves settled in. Pastor Robinson, if you will follow me? Oh, wait a minute, you don't need directions, you know where you're staying, right? You're never gonna let me live that down, now, are you? Can't see that happening any time soon. I'll see you in a little while. Penny for them? Just wondering what Roman is doing right now. Yeah, sucks you guys had to be apart for the summer. But hey, like, seriously, how surprised were you to see me? Since you didn't tell me you were coming, very. Well, I was pretty bummed that you were just gonna abandon me for the summer. Not by choice. So I decided, you know, if you couldn't be with me, then I would just come to you. Cassie. You know, because I just couldn't let you go through this on your own, and I thought there might be some quite boys... Cassie. What? Thank you so much for coming. I don't know if I would've made it without you. Well, that's what friends are for. Besides, that is how I roll. You are so lame sometimes. Lame, eccentric, who's to judge? I guess so. Now, if only I could hear Roman's voice right now, everything would be perfect. My dad took my phone, he said no phones allowed. Hmm. Wait. Ta-da! Cassie! How did you even... I know we're not supposed to, but, thought it might come in handy. I'm such a sneak! Yes you are. So now you can talk to Roman, because no one should stand in the way of love. Is everybody excited about their first day at camp? That's what I like to hear. How about you counselors? You're excited too? All right. Now that we're all ready, your counselors, led by Jessie, are gonna take you all on a nature walk, so I want you to go and enjoy the beauty of the world around you. Okay? All right, come on! Don't y'all lose them kids. Where are we going? Just down the trail. How far? Not too far. Are we going to do this every day? He's cute. Who, Alex? No, Jessie. Alex smiles too much, I think something's wrong with him. Maybe he's just filled with the holy ghost. Jessie's okay, I guess. Hadn't really noticed him. Oh, that's right, I forgot, love makes you blind. Okay. We're here. But where are we? - Exactly. - Huh? In our everyday lives, our minds filter out most of the information our senses give us. But here in nature, it can be incredibly uplifting to realize just how much of a blessing those senses really are. I want you guys to do me a favor. Close your eyes. Go on, trust me. You, too. My mama told me don't trust no man unless he put a ring on my finger. I want you guys to open up your senses. Listen to the sounds of the forest, your own bodies, and the people around you. I don't hear nothing. Shh. Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! I think I hear something. Are those crickets? No, fool. That's just Alex jumping. All right, all right, guys, calm down. Listen. Really sit back and listen. Next, I want you guys to try to smell. Smell the trees around you, the grass beneath your feet, and the air itself. Jessie? Is nature supposed to smell like doo-doo? Stanley. Sorry. Now, I want you guys to try and feel. Really feel. Feel the breeze against your skin. The shirts on your back, the sun in your face. Okay, open your eyes. Now, for the next few minutes, I want you guys to concentrate. Really concentrate on seeing and hearing everything that's around you. Danielle. You see something? No. She's just a little, shall we say, touched. Okay. I think you scared her. It's not you, Danielle's just really shy. She'll open up to the right person. Don't take it personally. Hi. Can I help you? I think I should be over there, okay? I'm Alex. Yup, I know. We met yesterday. I know that, right, do you come here often? Are you, ah, hitting on me? Yeah, well, I like you. You don't even know me. Well that's why I'm trying to do, get to know you. Yeah, um, I don't know about that. You're kind of weird. I mean, so are you. I can see it. We would be the perfect match. No, no, no, no, no. See, you are weird. I'm misunderstood. Did you hear what I said? Yeah. Why are you still smiling? Why not? So your dad is Pastor Robinson? Yeah, that's him. - What kind of daddy is he? - I be he lets you date. What do you know about dating? A lot. I got boyfriends. Right, Stan? How should I know? I like older women. How you doing? Quinn. Help. Mmm, rejected again. You're on your own. Oh, hey there, Sister Battle. Good afternoon, Deacon. Look at yourself. Oh. The children will be in here soon. Is this how you want to present yourself? I didn't notice the mess. Thank you. It's no problem, I'm happy to do it. You know, Deacon. I was reading in the book of Ecclesi... Ecclesiastes. One of my favorite books in the bible, yes. 4:11, this morning, and you know, I came across this particular verse I found very interesting. It said, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone? Ah, praise the Lord. You know what? I was thinking, Deacon. Wouldn't it be nice if you weren't alone and you stayed warm? I kind of like to sleep with the fan on, or the A.C. on. Oh... All right, young people, come on in! - Hello. - Have a seat. Today we're going to talk about temptation. And I ain't talking about David Ruffin and them. No, no, no, they don't know nothing about that! Now, who knows the story of Samson and Delilah? Now, Samson, he head a calling... Want to get out of here and see the rest of the camp? Sure. To begin the deliverance of Israel from the Philistine oppression. Now, having taken the Nazarite vow, Samson was put aside for God. Mmhmm. Part of his vow was to never cut his hair. That was the source of his strength. And Samson used that strength to wreak havoc on them Philistines, I mean, he's a big boy, he's real strong, and they get to fighting, they get to warring, and he'd knock 'em up. Wait a minute, now. You have to remember, Samson, he was human like all of us, right? He had desires and temptations. And the particular source of Samson's temptation was this gal named Delilah, she's a pretty girl, real, real pretty girl, see. And he fell in love with her. So when the Philistine rulers found out that Samson and Delilah was kickin' it, they came to Delilah one night, said, look here. We want you to go down there and find out the secret of that boy's strength so we can capture him. So Delilah, Deacon, Delilah, using her powers of seduction and deception, she wore Samson down. Wore him down. She persistently asked him questions about his secret, until finally, he gave in. He told the girl his secrets, and he should never tell his secrets. Huh, Deacon? No ma'am, no ma'am, you don't wanna tell your secrets. No, you don't. So children, let that be a lesson. Let that be a lesson to you, yes ma'am. Never tell your secrets. Oh, Deacon. So, Quinn. Tell me about yourself. Not much to tell. Pastor's daughter. What you see is what you get. Come on now, I doubt that. We all have layers. You just need the right person to peel 'em back. Uh, a boyfriend. I have a boyfriend. Thought you should know that. I'd expect you to. Listen, I'm not about to drop to one knee or anything. I just want to get to know you a little better. Maybe we could be friends. That sound cool? - I think that's all right. - Good. Then, I'll drop to one knee. All right, what can we learn from Samson? Stay away from girls, or you go bald and lose your eyes. That's what I'm talkin' about! If I went bald, I'd just die, just die! Okay, okay, everybody, let's just settle down. Now, you might say that Samson, liking Delilah so much, made him gullible, you might say that boy was stupid. See, he liked her so much, he couldn't see, he was blinded to the fact that she was lying, she wasn't keepin' it 100. Yeah, now that's how temptation works. Temptation can be anything, it doesn't have to be a man, or a woman, it could be your new video game. It could be your outfit. It could even be money. So, temptation is everywhere. So you have to be very careful. So, are you saying that wanting things is bad? Oh, no, no, no, no, there's nothing wrong with wanting things, as long as that wanting doesn't make you commit sin to get the things you want. All right, well, listen, that's it for today. I want you all to think about what we've been talking about. Okay, now you guys go ahead and run off to the cafeteria and have dinner. Thank you, thank you. I think that went pretty well, how about you? Yeah, I think so also. You know, they'll be ready for temptation, you know. You know, there's temptation everywhere. Oh, yes. Even the good kind, you know? Sister Battle, is there something in your eye? - Deacon, no. - Well, what's the matter? Oh, Deacon. Don't you get it, baby? Baby? My first name ain't baby. - Oh, Lord. - My first name's Steve. You know, just... - Quinn. Quinn. - What? Are you awake? If I wasn't, I wouldn't be talking to you. - Right, that makes sense. - What do you want, Cassie? I saw you talking to Jessie. Should Roman be jealous? Please. He was just being nice. He's a nice guy. I don't know. I think he likes you. Whatever. Go to sleep. - Okay. Goodnight, Quinn. - Night. I'm excited to see the talent these kids have. Well, you know, every year we put on a play, but, you know, I thought it was time for a change. - Yeah. - Yeah. All right, let's bring in the first camper. Hey there, Kevin. What's your talent? I'd like to do an interpretation of Matthew 16:23. - Well, praise the Lord. - Praise God, praise God. Kevin, you okay? Yes, Deacon Bacon. Just one second. Almost ready. Oh, well, excuse me. - Kevin! - Okay, I'm ready. Get behind me, Satan! Where are you, Lucifer, Beelzebub, oh great deceiver? Are you over here? Or over there? You are a stumbling block to me. You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns! So I take you in these blessed hands and say, Get behind me, Satan! - Well. That was spirited. - Mmm, yes, yes, yes. Uh, next? Break it down. Okay, thank you, thank you, Nikki. Thank you. Are you sure? Still got more to the routine. Oh, no, that was good, that was quite enough, thank you. - She was dancing, huh? - Uh, yeah. I think the one and three is important numbers as well. But she, was she dancing to a... It was a different beat. You know what, maybe we could still do a play. Hey, Danielle. Why are you over here by yourself? No reason. You know, everyone is over there waiting to audition. - Yeah. - You don't want to audition? - No. - Why not? It might be fun. They'll laugh at me. Danielle, I've heard you sing, you have a beautiful voice. No one will laugh at you. Yeah, but that's in a group of people. Then I know they're not looking at me. Hmm. Tell you what. How about, I help you out? And between the two of us, we'll figure this out. Yeah? Yeah. Who's next? Stan! Gonna show us your talent? Stan, what are you doing? It's the Heisman, Deacon Bacon. Okay. And why are you doing it? 'Cause I'm gonna go pro. Or be on reality TV. Either way, this is all I've gotta do. Okay. Thank you, Stan. Pastor, ain't none of these kids gonna make American Idol any time soon. Yeah. Um, what about a play, Christmas, we could do a summer version of the Christmas pageant... This is going to be a lot more difficult than we thought. Oh, Lord. What is she doing here? Melinda, I don't know, she just showed up. - Well, ask her to leave. - I can't ask her to leave. That wouldn't be the Christian thing to do. I know you guys dated, Charles. And that was a long time ago. Melinda, that doesn't matter. You are the only woman that I want. Yeah, well, she obviously doesn't know that. Well, I'm not responsible for anyone else's actions. Why did you bring me out here, Charles, for a "date"? Because I thought it would be really nice for us to spend time together, be with our daughter, have a movie night, eat in the cafeteria... Charles, when you invited me here, I thought we were gonna have alone time. I thought maybe we would go dancing, dinner, something to that effect. Why would you invite me to your job and call this a date? Melinda, I am trying. Charles, I know your heart is in the right place, but, this definitely was not a good idea. As God as my wit... Melinda. Charles? - Melinda! - Charles? Can I... I don't have time for this. All right, kids, it is movie night! Yeah! I wonder what movie we're going to see. I hope it's romance, I love romance. Do you think it'll be romance? I don't wanna watch that. I want to watch something else. Some action. Something with fighting. A chase. An explosion. Right Kevin? Boom. It'll probably be something lame, it's church camp. Look what we got going for you. A classic. One of my favorites, it's a movie called "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang". Oh, it has great songs, too. Yeah. One of my favorites says, k Oh, you, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang k Chitty Chitty... k Now, why you got your faces all turned down? Why do we keep watching old movies from the library? Yeah, I'd like to see a movie that was made after Jesus died for our sins. I feel like I'm dying right now. You better watch your mouth, boy. It's a good movie, something better than y'all be watching. Watch your mouth, watch the movie. Hey, Roman. It's me. Yeah, I know I haven't, but... I mean, it's not easy to... Of course I miss you. Look, don't say that, you know I'd rather be with you. Hey, I have a way that you can come see me, though. We're having a car wash tomorrow. You can come. Yeah, yeah, it's for free. Just show up and I'll send you the address. What do you mean, you'll think about it? Chris said what? Why does it always have to be about that? What? But you said that you would wait until I was ready. What does Kaye have to do with anything? If that's the kind of girl you wanna be with, Roman, just go be with her. Hello? Roman? - Hey. - Hey. You want some company? You look like you could use a friend. Yeah, that would be great. Listen, I know the movie selection wasn't the best, but don't you think you're overreacting just a little bit? It wasn't the movie. I know. But wouldn't it be better if it was? Yeah. - Roman? - Yeah. So, what did he do this time? Why do you think he did something? Isn't it always the guy's fault? I guess so. Let me guess. He's pressuring you to have sex, and you're not ready. You are a virgin, right? Is it that obvious? I mean, kind of. It's nothing that you should be ashamed of, though. But Roman said if I really loved him, then I would do it. - Does he love you? - Yes! Why would you say that? Because if he loved you, Quinn, I mean really loved you, he'd wait for you. He wouldn't pressure you, that's not love. All right, look, come on, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry. That's not something I would want to do. Okay, look, can we just talk about something else? Yeah. So, I met your mom today. She seems pretty cool. Yeah, she's great. Come on, now what's that about? Look, never mind. Come on now, you know you want to talk about it. Come on, you know you do. I mean, I just, I wish she'd act like a mother, you know, I know her childhood was taken away because her mother died and she had to take care of her sisters, but, like, why does she have to invade mine? You know, and I just need her to be an adult. Need her to be a mother. Quinn, will you do something for me? What? Close your eyes. Come on, trust me. What do you hear? Nothing. I don't hear anything. I know. It's kinda peaceful, isn't it? Yeah. What do you smell? I smell you. Are you wearing cologne? Maybe a little. I thought it might come in handy. How do you feel? Safe. Open your eyes and tell me what you see. I see you. And I see you. Thanks. No problem. What are friends for? I love it when the sky looks like this, you know? It's like looking into forever. You can see all the stars. Melinda. I know it was insensitive and manipulative to bring you up here, but I promise, I will do better. Please, don't leave. Charles, I can't take you trying to control me at every turn. You're pushing... You're pushing me and your daughter away. Why can't you see that? I do now. I just, I love both of you so much, I was afraid of losing you. I promise, I promise you, I will give you both more space. I love you. I love you too. So you'll stay? Say yes. Say yes. - Yes. - Okay. Hey, watch it, I can't get my hair wet. Sorry! That was not nice. What? It slipped, see? Look what you've done! I'm melting! I'm melting! I give up, I give up, mercy, I give up, I give up! Jessie. I'll take that. Wow, I guess the car wash is over, Deacon. He took the kids' hose. Maybe. You just couldn't let the kids have any fun, now, could you? Nope. No? What are you... What are you doing? Nothing. Stop! Stop! Quinn, please, please! This means war, everybody! - Hi. - Hey, Cassie. Um, I just... Sorry. You smile way too much. Bye. Okay, I definitely beat you in a game of basketball. - Today? - Yes! You don't remember? No. Okay, today, after the car wash, you were like, let's play one-on-one, and I was right there, made the last shot... the game winning shot. You mean the air ball you shot, huh? That was not an air ball! What would you call it? Hey, Roman. What's wrong? Why don't you tell me? What are you talking about? I didn't mean to pull you away from your date over here. Maybe I should just give y'all some space. He's just a counselor, okay? A friend. That's not what it looked like from over here. Roman, this is me we're talking about. Quinn. You've got nothing to worry about, I love you. You're right. What was I thinking? This is what I miss. This is what I needed. Me too. Been bored out of my mind all summer since you left. When are you coming back? Soon. You know, the "4th & Fireworks" party is next weekend. We've got our showcase next weekend. It's the biggest party of the summer. Like, you gotta go. I know, I'm sorry. I can't come. All right. I got you. Roman, don't be mad. Don't be mad? I haven't seen my girlfriend all summer, except for this. Now you can't come to the party with me because of this. Maybe we need a break. I need somebody that's gonna be there for me. Roman, Roman, don't say that. Look, maybe, maybe I can work something out. I won't hold my breath. You okay? - Whatcha doing? - Thinking. About... - Roman. - Of course. Roman. So, are you two okay? I don't know. I'm sure he just misses you. Yeah, I miss him too. You know, he wants me to go to the "4th & Fireworks" party with him. - "4th & Fireworks"? - Yeah. Isn't that the same night as the showcase, though? Yeah, I know that. Well, I've heard things about that party. It's not just like fireworks in the sky, you know... - Cassie. - It's a hookup party! I know that. Well, if you go, Roman's gonna expect you to have sex with him. Are you ready for that? I think so. I mean, maybe. I don't know. - Quinn. - Cassie, I love him. And I don't want to lose him, and I don't know what to do. - Hmm. It's a tough one. - Yeah, tell me about it. Okay, well, I guess I'll leave you to do some thinking, 'cause you have some really big thinking to do, like, really big. I'd like to do an interpretation of Matthew 16:23. Hey! There's still room up front, okay? Enjoy the show. What is Mary Magdalene doing here? She says she's here to support the kids. Mm-hmm. She needs to support those... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Sis. I'm just saying. When Jesus named her Chase, he was being ironic. You are a stumbling block to me. You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human... Hey, Danielle! You ready for your big moment? Yeah, but... What's wrong? Are you nervous? A little bit. We went over this a million times. You'll do great. - I know, but... - Danielle. I was wondering, you know, if you wanna, you could sing with me? If you wanted. I'd love to, but you don't need me on the stage. All right. I'll tell you what. I'll stand right over there, at the edge of the stage. If you get nervous at any moment, just look over, and I'll be there. The whole time? The whole time. Promise. Do we have a deal? Okay. And, coming to the stage we have Stan. Mmm, all right, let's give it up for Stan. Ready? Go get 'em! - Hey, you okay? - Yeah. It's Roman. - Hmm. You gonna go? - I guess so. - You sure? - Yeah. I'll be fine. K This little light of mine k I'm gonna let it shine k This little light of mine k I'm gonna let it shine k This little light of mine This is one of Quinn's favorite songs. Yes it is. She worked really hard with that girl. She really brought Danielle out of her shell. Excuse me for a second, I've got something to do. Shut up, church girl. Are you gonna beat me up? She thinks we wanna fight her, like we're criminals or something. No, church girl. I just wanna warn you. I don't like what you're doing to Roman. What I'm doing? What am I doing to him? Like you don't know. Look at her. Acting all innocent. Maybe she doesn't know. Oh, she knows. Her kind always knows. I don't, I really don't know. Look, you're teasing him with your church girl goodness. My what? Look, that is Roman Kraft that you have there. - All-City quarterback? - Fine as all be. And he doesn't have to wait for you. Do you know how many girls wanna give him some? I know of one. What? I said, he may not want none. Is that right. Well, tell me this, church girl. What are you doing here, at this party, if you don't plan on giving him some? Hmm? Hey, if nothing's happening in there, I need to use the room. Remember, church girl. Roman has options. I did it! I did it! You did! Danielle, you were amazing. Where's Quinn? Um, she had to step out for just a little bit, but she wanted me to tell you that she's really, really proud of you. But she promised. I'd like to recite a poem by one of the greatest poets of all time, written in the greatest book. And I'd also like to dedicate this poem to my wife, Melinda. Love is patient. Love is kind, it does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud... It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered. It keeps no records of wrongs... You should pay attention. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices in the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always preserves. Where there are tongues, they will be stilled. Where there is knowledge, it will pass away, for we know in part, and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. When I was a child, I talked as a child. I thought as a child, and I reasoned as a child. When I became a man, I put away childhood things, for now, we see only reflections, as in a mirror. Then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part. Then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. Melinda. I love you now, and always. God bless you all. Oh, hey, bible baby. You gonna have a drink with us tonight, bible baby? Sure, but no alcohol. I learned my lesson the last time. Oh, what do we say to that, guys? Huh? Boo! Hey, hey, hey, she's with me, she's with me. 'Sup, girl? Roman, Roman, you're drunk. Maybe a little. I could be more, though. Fill me up. Woo! Yes sir! That's what I'm talking about! I loved the program, and those kids were amazing. Yeah, yeah, I was a little nervous at the audition, but I would say it turned out to be a success. It did. I was proud. You know, a certain someone told me that romance should be spontaneous and fun. - I'm glad you listened. - Yes I did. Speaking of. I haven't seen our daughter. Where's Ruth? I don't know, I haven't seen her either, actually. Okay. Hey, Jessie. What's wrong, Jessie? Your daughter. You two having problems? I can't find her. I think she's with Roman. What? Cassie. Cassie. Where's Ruth? - I... - I? I know you know where she is, so just tell us. Okay, look, I didn't want her to go, okay, I told her not to. Go where? Just tell us, Cassie. It's okay. Just tell us where she is so we can go get her. Okay. If she's with that boy at some party, I'm gonna kill her. Okay, just, just calm down, Charles, okay? Let's just go get her, make sure she's safe. And then we're gonna kill her. Pastor Robinson. Mrs. Robinson. Let me go, I'll find her. I'll bring her back safe, sir. Let him go, Charles. I trust him. Okay, Jessie. Go find our daughter, please. Okay, uh, Roman, I don't know if I like you like this. What are you talking about? That's not what the text said. Whoops. You're just gonna take my word of it. Okay, what's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? 'Cause nothing's wrong with me. I'm just getting ready for our big night. That, that is why you came, right? Yeah, but... Yeah but nothing! It's okay! Chill. It's all good. It's all good. Like, I got you. It's cool. Quinn. You don't have to do this. Is this the dude from the car wash? I knew something was up! Jessie, what are you doing here? I came to get you. I'm here for you. - What? - That's right. I see you. I'm here with Roman. I know you think he loves you, but look around you, look where he has you. Quinn, look at him and tell me he loves you. That's not what love is. Quinn, just close your eyes and listen. I don't have to take this! I'm Roman Kraft. Any of these girls would be happy to take your place. If you don't smarten up, you're gonna lose me. Now are you gonna get in this room or not? Listen. This party isn't for me. So I'm gonna go outside and wait for you to join me. You're gonna have to walk through a door tonight. His or mine. Just know whatever you decide, you deserve the best. Now that he's gone, you ready, girl? It's way too crowded in there. I've got somewhere else better. Lead the way, babe. Hey. You leaving so soon? I was told that someone would be out here waiting for me. I thought I was wrong. I thought you chose him. Well, um, there were a few obstacles to get around to get to this door. Now you have some fences to mend. Thank you, Jessie. You worried your father to death, honey. Excuse me, I'm not your honey. Woman, what is wrong with you? What is wrong, baby? I'm not your baby. What I am is the pastor to this congregation, and the father to that young girl, and the husband to the wife that you keep disrespecting. Now I'm gonna ask you to leave. My wife and I would like to have a word with our daughter alone. Right on, Pastor. And I'll have a word with you later, Jessie. I am so, so sorry. I didn't mean to. You scared us. You scared me. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. Don't you ever do that to us again, you hear me? I promise I won't. We love you so much. I know that I've been more of a friend to you than I have been a mother, and I'm going to work harder to be less cool. So Ruth, you are grounded for a month. And now that that's all said and done, there's somebody that you need to apologize to. Go ahead. I guess you're pretty mad at me. I'd be mad if I were you, too. You promised you'd be there. I know. You weren't there. I looked for you. Everywhere. I'm so, so sorry, Danielle. Did I do something wrong? No, no, no, no, you were perfect. I made a promise to be there, and I wasn't, and that's not what good friends do. And I can only hope that you can find in your heart to forgive me. Maybe give me a second chance? - Quinn? - Yeah? Next time you have to sing with me. You got it, girl. Sorry. Praise God for our praise and worship dancer, Phil! Well, this is the first Sunday since the conclusion of our summer camp, and I want to welcome you all back. You know, I believe that we've learned a lot this summer. Some of us have learned that we have been putting our energies into the wrong people. And some others have learned that we have been taking the best part of ourselves for granted. And we're still waiting for others to realize that the love of their life is right in front of them. Amen! Yes, yes, yes! What? It's you. You're the one. Hallelujah! He finally gets it! Oh, thank you, Jesus! Yes, praise God, let the church say amen? Amen! Now, a selection from our choir.
