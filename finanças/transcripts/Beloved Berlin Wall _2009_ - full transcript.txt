< Beloved Berlin Wall > Stop! This is it! You wanna live here? Yeah. 100 marks excluding utilities It's all I can afford. I have a student loan. We're glad about every girl who studies here. West Berlin has a surplus of men who avoided the draft. - I'm one of them myself - Thanks for the advice. - Thanks. Take care - You too! Attention! '40 YEARS GDR' Hey, assholes, shit anybody today?" Shot "it is doubtful whether the tomcat will find its way back to socialism." - Meier! - Comrade 2nd Lieutenant! Hey! - Carry on - Yes, sir! Thanks. Thanks a lot. - Yeah? - Schulze. - Franziska Schubert, the new tenant - I see, but I can't hear anything. Here you are, Mr. Schulze. Do you know where the next... - supermarket is? - Around the corner. - In the East. Everything's half-price - Really? Those pigs won't let me in I peed on their pretty Wall. Their anti-fascist Wall. Can I bring you anything? Yeah... rolls - Rolls? - Yeah. - Your glasses? - I wear contacts. But not in your passport! - Just a moment. 25 marks. - It costs 25 marks admission? - Exchange. - I don't want to exchange. You have to, or you can go straight back! You can put it back in. Bag inspection. Are these presents? Go on! - Come on! - Step on it! Five pfennigs for a roll? - How much do rolls cost over there? - 20 pfennigs. It's incredible. Everything's about half-price. That's how it looks, too. - Hi. - Is that all? That's all I've got. This is a shopper's paradise. Oh yeah? Stop! Bag inspection! Are these travel items? - Souvenirs or whatever? - What? - This is state-subsidized food - Yes. I bought it with the money I exchanged Is that forbidden? Of course. They're not presents... Of course, they're presents. Presents for myself. It's my big treat: eggs, milk and flour! Got a problem? Comrade Assistant Commissar. Shit! Oh shit! Stop, Sergeant! - Stay where you are! - Meier! Come back! Sit down! Regarding the helpless... the person in need... Would you have helped out if it had been an old man? Yes, of course. It is clear that during your service as a GDR border guard you must avoid any contact with citizens from the West. Our armed forces are not relief organizations. What if she works for a hostile secret service and used that trick to make contact? That's a subversive activity. It means three years in prison. Your first and last warning, Sergeant. Dismissed. Observation Level 1. Observation Level 1. Our man at the Ministry for State Security? - Yes. - The Stasi thinks we had it all staged? Yes. Well, did we? What? That girl works for us? Not yet. Dramatic scenes in Prague. Thousands storm the FRG's embassy for fear that the border between the GDR and Czechoslovakia will be closed on October 7th the GDR's anniversary. I don't believe it. 4 p.m. Zoo Train Station?" - Sascha! - Hey, Uschi! I can work at the Kulturhaus three days a week three marks an hour. - Congratulations! - Aren't you on duty? - I got leave. - Bad boy! That's illegal! Fuck illegal! When do I get 'em back? Soon. You're a sweetheart. If you stain 'em, I'm gonna need new ones! Maybe from KaDeWe, the exclusive department store! I'll cross over like everybody else but through Hungary. The embassy in Prague is bursting. No vacancies. And you'll be the last one to turn off the light. Where are you going anyway? Thinks. - Coming! - Oh, Franzi dear! All the best in your new apartment May you never lack this. - Thanks, Aunt Jutta - Can I have a look? Yeah, sure. - It's nice. - I'm still unpacking - Great! - Thanks! - This is for you from Mom - My books! Thanks! I need a spare key, in case you lose yours Just for an emergency. Locks are expensive. I have lots of stuff: an iron, an ironing board You need anything? - Sure. - I'll bring it all over. Coming for dinner tonight? Horst is making hamburgers. I have a date. - That went fast - Yeah. If it's serious, you'll introduce me, yeah? I'm not sure it's possible. What do you mean? Is he secret service? Married? A foreigner? - I don't think so. - What do you mean? - Well... - It's a man,isn't itl? Yes, a real man. Great! - Hi. Am I late? - Hello. In Moscow you'd be two hours late but they're two hours ahead. - Sascha - Franzi. Would you like some nice East German or Russian ice cream? - Two ice cream cones, please. - Target person at ice cream stand. I haven't thanked you for your help. Did you get in trouble? No. - We could have been killed - It brings people together. I was never so afraid, as opposed to you. - Great, guys, you won - Over here. - You don't look so different without a uniform - Nothing is different here. - You've never been here before? - I never had a reason to come. Done enough staring? Nice. Then buy it now before it's sold out or forbidden. But, as you see, there isn't much else. If you want good books from our authors you have to buy them in the West. You can bring me some next time. If you want to come back. I'll take this one. I wouldn't mind coming back. Hostile powers leaving object. May I ask you something personal... or something political? Why do you guard the Wall? My grades weren't good enough to study medicine. That's why I enlisted for three years. It's my only chance to get accepted to med school. I ended up guarding the Wall because of Comrade Father. He helped guard the Wall when it was built in 1961. He wanted me to keep up the tradition. He has his contacts at the Ministry of Defense and all. That's tough That's why I left... for Berlin. So my father can't run my life anymore. We can't leave. And if we do, we risk our lives - I heard they awarded a fugitive medal yesterday - A what? - A fugitive medal? - An award for capturing a fugitive. A tin medal for vigilance and excellent service. Have you ever received an award like that? No, I'm night-blind. I don't see fugitives until it's too late. And they buy that? - Why don't you leave? - I want to be a doctor here. This is my home. I don't want to leave. RESERVED The coatrack is there! I'd like my coat nearby. Thanks. - May I keep it on? - If you feel cold... Just a minute! Did you ask? No, but there were too many chairs at a table for four. - It was the only one - I decide that! Well, in that case, there's one chair missing here. - This is a table for two. - Wrong! One chair is a table for one! Table 11 is solo. Understand? I thought it was 11 mono. If I didn't have my humor I'd get really mad! Listen! Our colleagues keep ditching us! Two of us work for 3.40 an hour, while our colleagues are living it up at the embassy in Prague, waiting to leave, and they leave us here all alone without letting us know! I've been doing their work for a week! Tables 8,9,10 and 11 extra! I'm at the end of my rope! I've had it! 11 stays solo, no matter what! And if you don't like it, cross the border! We're closed! Get lost! M1 to M2, take over, please. What's wrong? Was your cover blown? I think so. The target? The waitress... and the target. Terrific! A jerk like you belongs in the factory not in the secret service! Dismissed! At your command! Andy always told me I won't go without you. And now... Now he's in front of the Wall and thinks he's behind it. - Andy will... - What we had...He'll never find that in the West. No matter how long he looks He can't buy it either. What does it cost anyway? Love? You can buy sex but not this. Thinks. Who are you? A girl from the country. Now I live in Kreuzberg. - Single child... - You're from the West? Your first time in the East? A bar shrink from the West! I never would've guessed. It fits. I can tell. An East-West love affair. Oh shit! I'm Charly. Pork or pork? - Schnitzel or pork chops? - I don't eat pork. - This is pig land. We only have pork - Currency pigs. Exactly. Exports. Socialist pigs for capitalist money. In capitalism, people are exploited by people. Socialism is the exact opposite. Schnitzel? - Schnitzel without the schnitzel - Just the side dishes. Do you live alone? No, I live with my boyfriend. I was just kidding. My ex is a student in Heidelberg. He already has a new girlfriend. Thank you. Enjoy it. They branded a friend of mine as Enemy of the State, because he was a vegetarian. He refused to eat meat. And they accused him of resisting the socialist system. To them, he was a hostile person. In fact, he was just a vegetarian. - So what's become of him? - An Enemy of the State. - Your friend is in prison? - He doesn't want me to visit him. He wrote me in a letter that I'm no longer his friend me, the son of a party boss. He wanted the security guys who read his letters to understand it correctly: They shouldn't suspect me of agreeing with him. Thank you. The state declared the church to be in disrepair to keep dissidents from meeting here under the auspices of the church. - But it isn't in disrepair. Come on - No, I'm afraid. I'm with you. I'll race you to the top. My God, it's beautiful! - Hold me tightly? - Sure. Nice! Do you believe in God? No. That's strange. Nobody ever asked me that before. But it'd be terrible for my grandma if He didn't exist. - She's a devout communist and Christian - That happens? The fact that we met... I suppose it was meant to be. - I was on duty like always - I know. But why did my bags break just past the sentry bar? Why not ten meters in front or behind it? In that case we wouldn't have met. Are we fulfilling His plan? Plan fulfillment... perhaps. - Would you mind? - Not if it's a good plan. I have one, too. Yeah? Damn it! You gotta cross the border. If you're late, they won't let you in again! - Never again? - Never! I know! Come on! So that was it? Wait for me! - I won't let you haul me away! - Come on! Help! I'm being deported! - Will you come back? - Sure, I will. But not until October when I get a new loan. Then I can afford it. - What music do you like? - Bruce Springsteen. - Got it. "Tunnel of Love". - Really? He was here last year, and I went. 160,000 people. "Born in the USA!" Incredible! Everybody sang along! Even the Stasi informers! - I can't go any further, or they'll ID me - Okay. - I like you very much - I like you, too. Get moving! Hello Bye. The people will be allowed to travel tonight... After hours of waiting, they will travel in several trains through the GDR to the emergency camps in the FRG. Hello, Grandma... Dad! What are you doing here? Redecorating. What are you doing here? Why aren't you at the barracks? I have leave until six. Is that so? Ashamed to wear your uniform on leave? - I mean nothing to you without a uniform? - Huh? Aren't you on alert? - What for? - Because we're letting them go. In Prague. We're closing all borders with Poland and Czechoslovakia. What? That just increases the pressure! Those who are imprisoned want out. Imprisoned? If you have a visa, you can travel. Yeah, but who gets a visa? - Those who come back. It's a matter of trust - Yeah, sure. And those who don't trust us don't see that workers' kids have equal chances, women are equal, day care is free, rents are cheap, pensions are safe - and rolls only cost 5 pfennigs - Right! And to make sure it stays that way we flex our muscles. Sascha! - My father was executed in a concentration camp - As a communist. Because he fought for what we created here He died for this! But not so nobody can travel. It's 12:30. The boy is on duty at six. And you have a 1-hour drive to Neu-Brandenburg No visa needed! Go! - Good night, Mom. - Good night - Hey. - Hi, Grandma. Hello, Sascha. This isn't the stuff we produce, is it? No, I got it from Uschi From Uschi? Hay? Are you in love? Can you tell? Can tel. I want to dance with you." October 7th, GDR birthday, Kulturhaus!" - Come on, let's dance. - With Mr. Class Enemy? With Miss Class Enemy. It's a cliché that men from the West go for our women. But that you go for someone like me is... That's incredible! Because you're different different than the others. Ah, so I'm the different one? Sascha, get outta here! There's a riot outside! Out the emergency exit in back! Take your bags. Hurry! Here. - Don't let them catch you with her - Thanks. - Pretty. - My friend Uschi. - Oh yeah? - Careful! We got married five times in kindergarten We're like siblings. Without her I wouldn't have any jeans These are her jeans. Some give the shirt off their own back. Stop it! - Hey, I don't believe it. You little - Help! Stop it! Democracy and freedom! What a lie! You bitch! I'll... Help! Help! Stop it! Thinks. We can't get out this way. Hold this. - You guys would do anything! - Shut up! State Security. Drop your gun. - She's you're sweetheart? - Put your gun down and your hands up! Captain Seiffert, State Security. I'm in charge of this operation! Comrade Captain... No violence! We're the people! Comrade. Stop! Let the sergeant through with his girl. What's going on? The demonstrations in Leipzig were non-violent. - Red October - What? The 1917 Revolution in Russia. The rulers can't go on, the ruled won't go on. Will there be bloodshed? I hope not. Come on. Damn it! They're checking IDs We can't go together. We have to separate. I'll try to meet you at the platform If it doesn't work, Lenin Boulevard 180, Emma Meier, my grandma. We're in touch daily. We can talk about everything. you,too - When will I see you again? - I can't even cross with the groceries that I buy here. Otherwise I'd come once a week. I don't know. - Can I call you? - At the barracks? No, we're under surveillance. You can't write me either. Only my grandma. I have something for you. And this, too. Incredible! Think you. I hate saying goodbye. Take care of yourself. - Show me your ID - I beg your pardon. Show me your ID! You want to see my passport? Why not say so? Here you are. - Scram! - You want me to scram? But I have a passport! - I cross the border properly. I can't scram! - I can't either! - Got a passport? - No! If you got a passport, you can't scram. If you don't, you can't scram either! That's dialectics. Get outta here! Pretty. You're a stupid, love-crazed little sergeant. And you fall for the first gal from the West. Who said she doesn't work for the CIA? Just right now they'd love to know where our mines are, where the weak spots are on our borders When things get hot. And people start pushing here they want to push, too, from the other side, so the Wall caves in. You don't believe me? Let me tell you something You're our weakest spot. Whether she works for the CIA, the West Germans or the Mossad we'll find out right away. We have our informers. But how could you know? Of course not. But your little fling behind our backs possibly with a hostile secret service has engaged entire departments here. Thanks a lot, Sergeant. We have nothing better to do. 'Born in the USA.' You like this, huh? And for your loyal service and vigilance you want to be honored with admission to med school. Let me read your record. Five years... for hostile contact on duty leading to infiltration of our armed forces. Yeah, you have a price to pay, Sergeant. You owe us something. When's your next date? I don't think she'll be back so soon She can't afford it. You want me to believe you? Yeah. Oh God, you startled me! I rang the bell! Why aren't you at class? Hey, what': wrong? Hey, sweetie, what's wrong? Nothing. Are you lovesick, sweetie? He can't leave his ex. It was the same with Horst. Could you lend me 25 marks? Yeah. Thinks. - The coatrack - It stays on! Cold War plus hot hearts makes broken hearts. Got a pen and paper? Dear Sascha I'm worried about you. They'll lock you up. Because of me. You want to live here, but I never could. We don't stand a chance. We're living at the wrong time. We can't love each other. No asylum. Nowhere. Our love is dying before it was really alive. It makes me very sad, because I really like you. Thanks for the wonderful time together. Farewell, Franzi. Thanks, Chnrly. The most important love is unrequited love. There's nothing you can do. Hi Are you blind? You don't care, do you? - I don't understand - No? Come here! Look from this side. What do we see there? There, there and there? - When it dries you won't see a thing - But it's wet now. You've got Turks to do the mopping. - Hello? - A visitor from the West, Ms. Meier! - Hello, Ms. Meier, I'm... - I know who you are, dear. But we don't need to tell the whole house. That asshole! He tries to stir up everybody, good comrades. But he's a Nazi! - You have Nazis here? - We have everything. Come on in. Coma on. Hansi, don't take a crap! Hi there. I stopped by, because Sascha isn't on the watchtower. He's on a different tower. Or on patrol duty at a different border section. I see - I thought maybe... - What did you think? He was in trouble. Come in! Comrade... Her aunt works in Berlin West for the Federal Print Office. Great! Forms, applications, passports... Okly. Okay, listen. You'll have an affair with her. But you won't have any sex because if the lady isn't satisfied by the sex she'll end the relationship and we can't sound her out Entry... Plan: Recruitment of new contact. Political Operation, Line 15. Area of Operation: West. Student. Material interests,i.e. debts? Or political convictions? Compromising circumstances a car accident, a code name. He sometimes sleeps here. He can't stand the barracks I wrote him a letter That it's over between us. I'll write him another letter, an official letter I'll explain that our ideas are too different about society... I once received a letter like that from a concentration camp. From my husband. He saved my life. - Did your husband - No. They shot him for high treason. The times are different but...it isn't easy to live with a letter like that. He'll write you using my return address. Be patient. He won't survive. It's too cold. I'm so sorry. That's all right, dear. That's the problem with freedom. We can't live without it. But for him... it means death. I can't forget you. I kiss your lips. Your scent... I have to pick up my daughter. - I don't have a daughter - But I do. New line: "I've been transferred to a new border section. But I always think of you. May I invite you to dinner at the Kulturhaus? You know where. They only have a disco on the weekend. Otherwise it's a top restaurant. I have leave on November 8th I have to see you again. The landing target on my soul is still waiting for you. Love and kisses, Sascha." Final test. Testing one, two... three, four, five... - Hi there. Hey - Hi. - You got all dressed up for me? - My dress uniform. I've never seen you in a dress before. Just kidding. Don't worry. - Your grandma... - She's the best grandma in the world. How's college? Have you started classes yet? Yeah, well, it's boring. What am I studying? Phys Ed? - German? - To become a teacher? - Education? - Social work. - You can study that? - I can in the West. What would the honorable couple like? Honorable couple? That's funny. Would your Highness express what he wishes? - Steak with letscho - Letscho? - A side dish. - I'll take the side dish. And champagne. - I know so little about you - Same goes for me. What... Where could we get to know each other better? What's up? What's wrong? Nothing. - Allergic to the carnations? - No! Am. I can't stand 'em. I don't believe. The "people's" vases are well protected, huh? It's all artificial here. That's not it. So what is it? - Do you want me to leave? - No! Are you in pain? I have to tell you something and I want to be honest. I wanted to end our relationship. I'm afraid they won't let you study if we stay together or they might even arrest you. I wrote you a letter. Franzi, you shouldn't worry about me. But I am worried. Then your letter showed me how brave you are. It's your decision, too. Thank you. - Do you know than guys? - No. Why? You keep looking at them. But they aren't looking at you. That's strange. Yeah. The one on the left looks like a pedophiliac math teacher who looks under girls' skirts during a test It's true! Franzi! The one on the right looks like a Stasi rat on vacation. Calm on the outside, but inside bursting with vigilance. Hold up your hands. Is it okay now? Oh dear! Did I save you? I'm your guardian angel. I'll be right back. Where's she going, Sergeant? - I tried. Sorry - Shut up! Do you think you're believable when you don't talk? - I wanted to deny it - Deny it? Are you crazy? You have to agree with her you idiot! I am a Stasi pig, but on duty, not on vacation. Always after the enemies of the state. We're everywhere. More Stasi than enemies. Understand? Don't play the loyal socialist, or she'll write you off her list! - Hi. Hey, you're... - Uschi, Sascha's friend. - Hi,Franzi - Hi,Uschi Hey, Sascha is different today so... uptight... and... He always feels like shit in uniform or that he'll be recognized. Especially here. I hadn't heard from him since the riot. He might have his period. He's a virgin ' No! ' Oh Yeah! So be careful. Great! How? Whirl? - It's too late. I've gotta get back - Another time. May I? Hey, what's going on? Everything's blurred. Can you look as stupid as me in this picture? It fits Incredible! I'll be damned! Me in the West! I always wanted to go over and have a look! - I'm going crazy! No! - Here tomorrow. Same time. No, at 7 p.m. That's when I start to work. - Promise? - Cross my pioneer heart. If I were her, I'd hightail it over the border. Go to my place first, Sebastian St. 86. Then get changed and hit the town! My spare cash is in the drawer where I keep my underwear. - What for? - You need money to come back. Oh shit! - You gotta take a taxi - Yeah? Didn't I say so? She's leaving! I'll see you in my office tomorrow, you jerk! Asshole! The landing strip on my soul. Yes, it's me! Come on. I want you. Come on! I have to check and see who I am. Okay, my name is Ursula Ziesche born in Meissen. I'm in my first year of History at the Humboldt University. Oranienburger St. 22, that's where I live. - You're crazy. - Yeah. Crazy for you. Why did she go from the toilet to the border without saying goodbye? Don't get. Is this supposed to be you? You need a new photograph. Get yourself a new passport. Hey there! What if Uschi gets arrested, because she doesn't really resemble you? Or if they talk to her and hear her Saxon accent? Then they'll be here soon. We have to get up early. I'm on duty at six. Franzi, I have to tell you something. The Stasi is blackmailing me. That's it! None of that stuff! The cathouse is in Potsdamer St. And if that's too expensive, then go East The girls do it for... Stasi. We know you're there. Open up, or you'll have to buy a new door! Hello, may I see your passport? May I? Shut up! Have a seat, please. As you know, we have excellent spies operating in every secret service. And they find out almost everything And by one of... our colleagues who works for us in the Stasi we were told that your friend Sascha is a Stasi informer. Did you know that? It really blows you away, doesn't it? We'd like you to tell us what he wants to know from you. Your friend, Sascha. We require that you tell us everything, or else you'll be charged with treason. Please sign here. November 9,1989... 11-09-89. Sign here, please. You are now under our protection. Just report everything, and everything will be fine. Goodbye, Ms. Schubert. C.l.A. oh no! I'll be damned! "Good morning, love. I'm at work. Please, leave before someone comes. See you tonight. Lots of kisses, Sascha." You must have warned her. How else can we explain that she fled from the toilet to the West? If you don't know... Then? What then? - I no longer feel safe in my country - Oh... I know where you'd feel safe. You'd even be safe from the Stasi. In preventive detention! - Where my grandpa was also detained - I have no idea. In Buchenwald as a communist. Proof: Since September 11th your girlfriend from the West has been working for the CIA in West Berlin. Our counterespionage agents risked their lives at the CIA to find out this information. What do you say now? State Security, Lieutenant Colonel Haack. You are Ms.Ziesche? We've come to clear up a particular matter. Would you permit us to enter? Yeah! Have a seat. - So, we study History, do we? - Yeah. We have an ID, don't we? Yeah. Think you. Sascha, your boyfriend... Have you known each other long? None of my business. Your Sascha... He loves somebody else. Yes, a girl from West Berlin. An agent from the CIA. Your Sascha is more devoted to that woman than to our country. He dumped his revolutionary class vigilance overboard. Probably out of love. And we have to find out what our rivals are planning to do with that US whore. But, as I see, he was able to keep Franziska a secret. Yeah. That's really hard. Really hard. Not only for the sake of our republic, but also for the sake of Comrade Meier we have to ask you, as his childhood friend... Ursula... to work with us. Regarding your specific case, everything that has to do with Sascha like conversations, dates... must be documented in this document. Pick your own code name. Okay? I hope we'll work well together. Yeah. So, what's this here? The topic of our meeting: Disband or reform... our Free German Youth?" This is the first meeting this year. - It starts in an hour - Yeah. That's right. Stand up for what you believe in. - Yeah - Here. This is for you, and this is for me. Here is my card, just in case You can reach me anytime. Off-hours, too. Hey, you're here after all! What's this here? A real erotic hit! Where'd you get these underpants? I'll bring you a pair of mine. How's your love life? Franzi, the water heater's broken. You've really got guts! I'll be back soon. Just brought you something. Bye! Oh shit! Wegener, Secret Service. Can I see your ID? Think you, Ms. Schubert. We were contacted by the CIA. We are required by German law to require you to give assistance. Here you are. It is in your own interest. We have a few questions. We better not ask them here. 'Love,Sascha.' Copy it. Now she's trapped, Schneider. Our feelings are stronger than the Wall I long for you. I will omit... - May I say something? - Go ahead. I will omit no opportunity that... may convey my greetings, love, to thee Heinrich Heine." What's up? It isn't Heine, it's Shakespeare "Romeo and Juliet." Romeo's farewell after their night of love. - Then replace it - What? Heine with Shakespeare. - I'd never write this way - She has no idea. Get started, damn it! If you don't talk, we assume you aren't willing to help, that you are working for the Stasi That's treason, Ms. Schubert. Paragraph 100: A relationship that endangers peace. You get 5 years. Here you are. Goodbye. The fucking West! Nothing against the handicapped. But I hate deaf-mutes who aren't deaf. Uschi? Uschi? - Yeah! - At last! Know what? Sascha works for the Stasi, says the CIA. They're blackmailing him to get at you. And the CIA wants to use you to get at Sascha. The Secret Service wants the same They came to my place... - to your place. Your mother, too - No, that's my aunt. Okay, your aunt. She wants to get me panties 'cause mine are unerotic. She called 'em an "erotic hit - Uschi, did you take anything? - Sure. I took everything in stride, but I didn't say anything. Here! I had to sign for you. You work for the CIA and the Secret Service. What? Oh God! And you're now a Stasi informer. No. Oh yes. I had to sign for you The Stasi came to see me... to see you. Oh no! I have to tell Sascha not to believe them, but how? Stay here one more day and show it to Sascha. But make sure no one listens. - Did it work with Sascha? - What? - Thu in? - No. What? It still didn't work? Oh no! I still haven't seen much of the West except for your place and the spies! - Same time here tomorrow? - Yeah. Okay. I gotta go back. I mean, you do. Those two spies have been after me. They're probably waiting for me On your mark, get set, go! I don't believe it. She came here to pee for a 25-mark mandatory exchange. - Grandma Emma, I have a problem - Hit me. - Oh, a visitor. - This is Sascha's girlfriend. At least one girl who believes in us... - Friendship - Franziska. Kurt Meier, Sascha's father. Have a seat. Did you have a meeting? So, do you want to disband? Not yet. It would be our downfall. If the youth organization turned its back on its founding party. That's treason. It's high treason. They used to execute traitors. You want to shoot all Free German Youth members... for not doing the bidding of your party? Blockhead! - I didn't want to... - What do you think about the fugitives who got their training here and now ran to the West? They were worthless here, and they'll be worthless over there. Most of them will soon want to come back to our social security and our steady jobs. - But we won't let them return - Hansi's in the West. He left! He went to West Berlin, to the Lehmanns in Kreuzberg. They just called to say they found a blue budgie on their balcony. And all he says is: "I'm Hansi Meier, Lenin Boulevard That's what I taught him. And they called information. Isn't that nice? They're bringing him to the checkpoint at Heinrich St. And I'm going to pick him up, my Hansi I'm going to pick him up. - Is he allowed to return? - Huh?
