Do you want to ask anything to him? Once my parents are okay with him then there is nothing to talk. Why are you like this? Where is the sari? Where are the jewelleries? You dreamt it again? You don't have any other work? If you marry and have children then why will I dream of it. Will I get any chance in this life of having a function in this house? You can think of that later. First prepare my tiffin. Good morning, Daddy. - Morning. What's the news? - Same old thing. Crime here and scam there. - Lunch. Take it. - Nothing will change. First think about marrying your daughter then you can think about the whole world. She started early in the morning. - She didn't even stop. She was even dreaming of it. Bye, Daddy. - Bye. Just wave your hand and send her to office. Don't you think, you should be sending her to in-laws house. Yes, Mr. Satyam. I am leaving. I am on the way. Satyam. He's waiting for me. Bhumi. You go to the supermarket lane, right? Yes. - Drop me there. No, I won't drop you. - Why? Even the car is empty. This is not a share auto to drop everybody when it's empty. Tada! What? Photo session. For followers. #MondayMotivation If they see you early in the morning, how will they get motivated? Madam. - Not you, those who invented the front camera should be punished. I can't punish him so, from tomorrow I will ban cell phones inside the office. Hi, mam. I made a beautiful plan for the factory/warehouse/office. You will love it. Check it out. It's so nice, right? Yes, it is. - Thank you. Use it for your house. Sorry, Mam. - This is not your hostel that you can come at anytime. I am just 10 minutes late, Mam. - 10 minutes? Leaving holidays, your working days are 280. If you are late for 10 minutes everyday, then you are late for 2800 minutes for a year. That means, it's nearly 47 hours. If one working day is of 9 hours, then it is roughly 5 days. So, calculate your pay minus 5 days loss. Oh, God! Whoever marries her... Yes, whoever marries me... Did I say it out loud? - Bring that phone here. Bring it here. I want this month's sales report on my table by evening. Mam. - Bring me the report and take your phone back. Uncle. Morning. Please come. Hi, morning. Sit, sit. - Please come in. So, this is the project idea, Uncle. - Nice. And this concept is pretty good. - I really liked that too. Yeah. Why do you scare them so much? They don't have much responsibilities, at least they should be afraid. I am afraid of you that one day you will scold me. So, what's up? What is your mom saying. Same old thing. She is going out to meet them because I am scolding her if she brings anyone at home. Why don't you adjust yourself because of her, then? If I want to stay together for lifetime, first I should connect to him. I hope you find your connection very soon. Hi. - Hi. You told me to come urgently from Paris. What's the matter? I want to go to India. Why do you want to go there? - You know, wherever you look, you just see black coats and white beards. Even if you come out, you just see tall buildings and cars. It's been so many days, I am missing the village vibes. Now, what do you say? You were saying, there's some project in India, right? - Yes. Tell them, we are ready to take the project. I need a break from here. You are thinking about taking break? Hi, sir. - Let me break some news to you. Have a seat, sir. Thank you. When I saw you on the dais you looked like upcoming billionaire. When I see you here, you look like a college student. Okay, I will come to the point. Sure, sir. - I will give you a deal which will increase your bank balance to 200 crores. 200 crores? If you are okay, I will make the papers ready by tomorrow. Thank you. But no thanks, sir. I am not interested. Did you listen the numbers correctly? It's 200 crores. After 2, there are nine zeroes. I already told you, I am not interested. I thought, you only looked like a college student. Even your thinking is the same. I know, money is very necessary. But that is not the only thing that is necessary. Nice meeting you. Hey, 200 crores? I am just speechless after telling that. How can you reject that so simply. You forget about that 200 crores and get two tickets to India. What Madam, didn't you like the guy you met that day? No. The boy said okay after seeing the photo but my daughter said no without even seeing the photo. Leave it, Madam. He was a bit average. Was he? - Yes. Just see this once. - Shall I tell the truth? The last guy was better, Madam. - Go. You will tell something to everybody. Shall I bring you coffee? Go, bring it. - Okay. If I won't purchase anything you people will tell me not to sit here. You are good looking in person than the photo. Whom are you searching? Are you waiting for somebody? - Where is your daughter? She won't come. - Oh, she won't like coffee smell? She won't like the concept of this kind of meetings. Then, why did you call me? - Talk to me, son. If I like you, then I will talk to her. I thought, meeting in the coffee shop is like a new trend. People will be open minded. But, she is not even present here. I can imagine, how my future will be with her. Son. Hi, Daddy. - Hey. Why is this house so silent. Where is Prabhavati? She is not here. She went to the temple. Oh, she is not back yet? - No. If you get married, she made promise to God that she will do some extra worship. Praise be to the Lord Venkatesha. - I didn't marry yet. Oh, she is already here. Give me that phone. I will call her. Where will she go? She will be back soon. There she is. Oh, God. Oh! You look tired. Oh, God. My legs are paining. - Oh, God. Where did you go? - Can't you see. I went to Venkateshwara temple. Take the showbread. New sari, showbread, flowers, leg pains. You are managing it all very nicely. But, if someone goes to temple they will crush the coconut not bring the coconut to the house. Won't you change? I won't change. Mom, marriages won't happen like this. Then tell me, how marriages happen? I will do it like that. Just making me sit like a doll, or scanning me if I they like me or not. I can't do those. Who rejected you? You are only rejecting them, saying you are not connecting with them. Should I connect with whoever you show me? If you want to connect with somebody, you should see him first. Women of your age are having babies and sending them to school. And here I am, searching a husband for you like a mad woman. I am very unlucky. I can't tolerate all this. Are you... - Satyam. Satyam. Hello, Satyam. Good morning, mam. Mam, after thinking deeply I made another design. If you see this, your mind will be blown. Trust me. How much will you take? Thank you. I know, you will like this for sure. Also, I am comfortable for any negotiations between us. Just give me whatever you like. - Not for this design. I don't want to see you coming with another design. Thank you, mam. Sarla, please think about your likes. Please, don't come on my way. We are about to start a new manufacturing unit. Once we start it, I will inform you. You can visit that day. Madam. What are you seeing? - Madam. Give me the phone. Give me. What is this? I try to hide it inside, mam. But, it comes out bursting. What is that? - Talent, mam. Next time, if I see something like this you will loose. What will I loose, mam? - Your job. Monster. Check this fax and give it to mam. You go and give. - This is so important, you must give her. I can't give her. What to do, Oh, God. This is like a roller coaster ride. My life is like a game In the hands of my Boss. What can I say, brother. Like a serial story she is full of pride. She is full of pride top to bottom. Oh, oh, these stories are all true. She is always angry and full of pride. She is not just like that for once or twice. This is the daily problem with the life. Oh, God. Don't be so hard. Life is so bad. Why is she so mad? What to do? Oh, God. Don't be so hard. Life is so bad. Why is she so mad? What to do? We never know... - Good job. how her mood will be? Sometimes she is so angry - Sarla. Sarla. and sometimes she is not. She is beautiful but she is mad more. She is like a fire brand But she is not dumb. Oh, oh, these stories are all true. She is always angry and full of pride. She is not like that just for once or twice. This is the daily problem with the life. Bhumi. Why did you shout at that architect? Our company's concept and the design he made is totally different. He should've at least used his common sense. Correct, but don't be too strict, Bhumi. Even our office staff is afraid of you. No student likes to go to school, Uncle. Everybody just wants to play. But, when they study their future will be bright. I am not talking about them. You are being too strict for yourself. When I was not strict, nobody took me serious. Now, when I am being strict nobody wants me to be with them. If I tell you the truth I don't even remember, how I was back then. I don't even know, how should I be. Hello, Akash. - Hello, Uncle, How are you? I am good. How was your travelling? Goutham said, you are coming here. If you are free tomorrow, I will come and meet you in the office. You are not some outsider. Come home. Sure, Uncle. Hey, you said you wanted to see sari and chudidaar. Here, size of buildings are increasing and size of clothes are decreasing. - Stop it. This is the problem with you. You don't see them and you won't allow us to see. Hi, Uncle. - Hi, Akash. You reminded me of my son, I am so happy that you came. Do you remember him? Akash. Hi, Aunty. - How are you, son. Yes, I am good. - How is my son. He is fine, Aunty. Tell him to come and meet us at least once a year. Okay, I'll bring you some coffee. - Okay, Aunty. I saw your interview on CNN. I felt very proud. - Thanks, Uncle. You will leave early or will you be here for some days? Actually, I have some important work here. Okay. - Yes, Uncle. Come Bhumi. Why did you stop there? He is Akash. He is a friend of Goutham. - Hi. She is... - Bhumi. You people know each other? - Yes. Yes, Uncle. We were in same batch in the college. One minute. You guys sit down. - Okay, Uncle. I will be right back. Hello. It's been many days, right? - Yes. You look very different. What are you doing now? - Nothing, just small business. You? - Akash. You said something about a project. Did it started? It's almost getting started. Bhumi, you know he is very famous architect. Oh! I just remembered. We have a small project. If you are free just look at it once. We don't need so big architect, Uncle. You are afraid, he will charge more? Bhumi is afraid that it will be out of budget. Nothing like that, Uncle. One second. Hello. You are informing me now that raw materials didn't arrive. If you can't do the work. Go home. Bloody morons. Need to go, Uncle. Sorry. Bye, Akash. - Bye. What happen, Akash? Are you confused? She might be a bit angry, but she has a very good heart. Hi, mam. How can I help you? Please give me some time. Hey, what are you doing here? I should ask that. I stay here. I came here for a business deal. Oh, okay. I will accompany you till then. You know what. You are in sari when everyone around you are in middies and jeans. You know, you are very beautiful in sari. Don't make silly compliments like a college student. There is nothing wrong giving complements. Age doesn't matter. But seriously, you look so beautiful in sari. Did you do any course in flirting? Hey, I am telling you the fact and you think I am flirting. I don't like all these. If you are this beautiful then you can't miss all these. What's up? How's business going? Yeah, fine. - Great. Uncle said something about a project. Do you want me to look into that? No, no. Not necessary. It's a small project. Hey, don't worry. I'll help you out. No need Akash. It's not your range. Okay, I'll leave now. What? You are here to meet someone, right? How can I do business those who don't respect time? In business people go through finances, not time. Money is necessary. Just money is not necessary. Bye. She is interesting now. Why didn't I knew it then? I didn't observe her before? Or I never knew about it. - Hey, is that you, Akash. Many girls have proposed you. Did you even care for anyone? She is new and different. So, I must closely observe her. For that, you must go nearer to her. Yes, I know a way to do that. - Okay. Whom are you calling? He will take me closer to her. Hello, Akash. - Hi, Uncle. Hi, Bhumi. He's Raghu. He is my friend/PA. - Hello. Hi. So, you are doing our project then? Yeah. Mr. Bhupati asked me and I can't say no to him. He said, you called him and you want to do it. Oh, that's what he said? That's how you did. I told you, this is a small project. - I will do it. I don't like everything that easily. Later, you will only be in trouble. What? There's no chance you won't like it. This is not a big matter to him. He makes it look very simple. Let's see. Sir, tea. Sir. Sorry. Sorry, mam. - Idiot. Can't you see? - Sorry, mam. Clean it. - Okay, mam. Hey, you said she is interesting. She is totally different. Don't judge her. Hey, she is not your range, Akash. She is not your match. If you want to be near to home, you must decrease your imagination. Okay. Kishore, come to my cabin. This is our site layout. May I come in, mam? - Yes. He's Akash, architect from Paris. This is Kishore. If you have any doubts, he'll clear it. - Sure. Hello. For just a small sketch, you came from Paris. Do you think, we don't know how to sketch? You are hear to clarify our doubts. Not your doubts. Wow. You are so handsome. One selfie, please. - Sure. Selfie Sarla? Do you know me? Your tiktok videos are so famous even in Paris. They removed Tiktok and kicked talented people like me. Thank God. - You guys just gossip or do any work? She saw her while saying it but I think, that was for us. Do you doubt that? Where is the site? What is the plot size? What are GHMC norms? Who is present at the site? How much paper work is done? If I get the details what I just asked in two days. We will start the work. Let's go. - Two days. Sarla, come with the sales register. Why is she telling me to bring the selfie? She didn't say selfie. She told you to come with the sales register. There are many unique people's here. Hey, you are in India but you won't come home? I will come. I just have a small work. When it's finished I'll be there. It's been two years since you were home. I just look at you in the mobile screen. Hey, someone catch him. Hey, hey. Oye. I will call you again, mom. - Hey. Wait. Hey. Thank you, son. It's okay. Just check whether everything is there or not? I came to the cafe to meet a guy for my daughter. When I came out, he stole the bag. You are meeting a guy for your daughter in a cafe? Please tell me more details about it. It seems little different. Yes, I know. - You must be careful. What if something happens to you? Nothing happened to me. You were here to help me in the correct time. Okay, I'll leave now. I will drop you. - No. No need. I will go in the auto. Okay. Auto. Will you drop me to Jubilee Hills? - Yes. Bye, son. - Bye. This is our proposed site in Shad Nagar, sir. If we stay here, even if we are so talented they will see us as locals and as a cheap. If you come from abroad, they are imported and they will be respected more. Don't feel bad, Kishore. Thank you. Even if you come from Paris or Pattapar, you will be the same. #joke They are NRI's so, #moz Inform Bhumi also. I already informed her. She said to tell you. Brother. Genuine question. Is he understanding anything or is he just acting? Bring another one. - One second, sir. Bindu. Marker. - Okay. She is bringing. - Bring an imported marker. Do you like her? She worked hard to give him that, that means, she likes him too. Excuse me, sir. Go. - Follow. Their love story is so complicated. Girls background is so dark like a Maniratnam movie. Boy's background is rich like Trivikram movie. This whole complicated love story is directed by our big man. Who? Mr. Bhupati? Yes. There he is. Speak of the devil. He will definitely hit a century. Now see, she will go and talk to him. Hi, sir. How are you? - He will reply her casually. She will laugh, as if he said a big joke. Okay, okay. But, there's no big joke in there. He pays her, that's why. Whatever he says, she will laugh. This recipe is only known to telugu people. Then, why don't you do it? I tried, but I never understand, when to laugh or when not to. When I try to laugh, he will leave till that time. Did you get it? Even this small thing is an art. Please, don't judge an artist. Oh, God! When are you going to see the site? We were just leaving. - Good. Kishore. - Mam. Show them the site. - Mam. You also go, Bhumi. Uncle, if I go then who will take care of the office? This is not a border of India. Nobody will come and destroy if you are not here for sometime. Superb. Good one, sir. Good one. Superb. Oh. He is more bigger artist than everybody here. We'll go in my car. There's no problem going in their respective cars. I don't know the address. Kishore. - Mam. You come with him. - Yes, mam. Brother, looks like your madam is too strict. Just be frank about it. She is always angry. If there was any premier league in anger, in every season she would've been the winner. I think she is not married yet. - Who will marry a girl like her. We can adjust if woman are not beautiful but we can't if they are angry. Bhumi. Nice sari. - Let's look at the site. Nice sari? Your boss is trying to make an ice in the desert. Yes. Hello. Bhumi, what's this eco friendly? You alone will change the world? Why? Do you have any problem? Why so serious? I am just kidding. She is born to reject men and architects. Did you see any batsmen who can hit sixes every ball. There he is. Did you see any umpire who gives no-ball for every delivery. There she is. Mom, what did you prepare for breakfast? What was that suppose to mean? What happen to your mouth? She vowed that she won't talk. Won't talk. My mom just talks about my marks and your mom just talks about your marriage. If she vows, will I be married? My mom is praying for my marks, but am I getting it? Leave them, it's their belief. Okay, tell them to do this everyday. We will have some peace of mind. But I won't make my mom suffer like you. Whoever gives me the first love letter I will marry him. First study then think about marrying someone. Who are these guys? - Social media is filled with heroines and your house is filled with boys photos Who is this guy? Look so good. Let me see. Let me see. - Let me see. Did you like him? Should I talk to them? You talked. Don't act those vows and homages in front of me. Bhumi, it's cheating. What happened? Who is cheating. Yes. - What happened? She broke Prabhavati's vow. Monster. - Hey. What is this? - That's Sreedhar's daughter's marriage who stays in house number 12. She was just a baby and she already was going to school. That is an invitation card. Don't cry while reading. What is left except crying because of you? If you are so sad, then don't go to the marriage. Don't link everything to my marriage. When people ask me about your marriage, I am just speechless, and I even stopped going to marriages. Hey, did you just born me only for marriage? Why are you hiding as if it is a crime. You broke my vow and made me speak. Also go and shut their mouths. Hey! Enough? Even in AC you are making me sweat. Tell me what you are here for? - Yes. What is today's date? - You came here to ask that? You told you will deliver my order on 18th. Today is 19th. There is no stock nor any phone call that it will be late. Then, how can this continue? Karthik. Come to my cabin. You guys didn't deliver him yet? Production has been delayed, mam. It's only been completed 70%. Why didn't you inform them? How can you be so irresponsible? What's the matter? - Let's do one thing. Like old ways, I have materials which are ready to be delivered. I will sell it to you. If you use it and mix it with your material we can earn much more. I won't use such cheap materials for our work. Oh, you got angry. Your madam didn't read the agreement properly, I guess. If you don't deliver the material in the mentioned date, you will need to pay back double. I am doing what I like. I won't leave it, even if I have to bear some losses. Check the background before accepting the deal from next time. If you think, they are not appropriate throw them out. If you want to impress this kind of girl you must be with them for some time. Mam, raw material file. Is the plan ready? It's being ready. - Why are you taking so long? You won't like anything very easily, right? In my heart Your eyes Are being drawn Like a flower My imagination Is full of yours. My breath is asking If I like you or not? Even If I am far away I am strongly connected to you. Those eyes makes my heart glow. I only dream of you. If you kill me with that smile I will give my every life for sake of you. Come here to me. Do some magic on me. On the way you are going the air is full of love. That air is all around me. My eyes are finding you everywhere. These are making me to only look you. You are like a slow song in my heart every time. I want to stay us together I wish that happens soon. Those eyes makes my heart glow. I only dream of you. If you kill me with that smile I will give my every life for sake of you. Come here to me. Bring that happiness with you. I must think out of box. Actually, out of the galax... What brother? Did he make it? No, brother. I would've been done ten times by now. Shaving your beard? - Sketch. There is a difference between LKG student's drawing and Engineer's drawing. Akash. - Tell me, Sarla. I made a new video. Do you want to see it? If I say no, will you leave me? Give it here. When I see your eyes I forget everything. When I see your hips I keep forgetting everything. When I see your lips I forget everything. How is it? Mind blowing, Sarla. What happen? - I cut my finger. Give me that first-aid kit. - Yes. What happen? - Nothing. You should be careful. Don't worry. It's just a small cut. What is happening? Sorry, mam. I was in a hurry. If you worry, did the pain stop ? If you cry did the bleeding stop? It's not wrong liking some one but don't make others suffer because of him. Without showing any concern, she is getting angry. Even getting angry is one type of concern. Only if you understand. Now-a-days, I can't understand you. Totally. Hello, son. Hey, the same lady. Come, let's meet her. I was just seeing whether you were the same guy or not. How are you? Yes, I am good. How come you are here? She must be here to meet again someone for her daughter. Hey. - Yes, son. You are saying it so nervously, that means... How will boys like the girl when they won't meet her. Correct. Who is he, madam? In one day, you arranged two meetings? No. I know these people. Do you want some coffee? - We just had it. Why are you trying so hard, Aunty? You can tell your daughter, right? If she listens, I can shout at her. She is not afraid of anybody. I must not say this but, she is a monster. Even her daughter is like our madam. Are you married? No, Aunty. But I am in love with someone. Oh, good, good, good. There's nothing good. Everything's bad. Why are you saying that? I can't explain it to you. Almost, she is similar like your daughter. I don't understand this generation girls. Even if Lord Rama comes, they will make excuses. Oh, time's up. She might be home soon. Okay, I'll leave now. - Okay, Aunty. Son. - Come, let's go. Take my phone number. If you know any nice guy, please tell me. - Sure, Aunty. Bye, bye. - Okay, Aunty. What do these women want? They don't care, if someone loves them, they won't listen to their mother if they like someone. Your problem is that she is not caring me, right? We'll show the sketch tomorrow. - Okay. That's it? You came all the way here just for this? Impressive. Will this be enough? If I take something, I'll make the job done. I have that confidence on my work. For the first time, I was afraid that you would reject. You made me look into myself. This calls for a celebration. Shall we go out for coffee? I don't have a habit of that. Even if it's late, we can change few habits. I don't like new habits. Shall we show this presentation to Uncle? Can we go in my car? - We will go in my car. Chocolate? No. Why? I don't like chocolates. I gave you back your money. Then what is this? I am fine with the money. What about my ego? First of all, I am very short tempered also, I am aged now. From the day you insulted me my blood is boiling like anything. If I leave you thinking you are a girl... but when people come to know about this next time someone comes and throws slipper instead of cheque. I am a person when a branch comes in the middle, I'll cut the whole tree. And now... you stood as if... Just being elder is not enough. You should know to respect ladies. Akash. Weather is hot outside. Go and sit in the car. What did you say? If branches come in the middle, you will cut down the whole tree. Celebrities are challenging each other for growing trees. And you are saying you will cut the trees? I just said it for a punch. I have many plants in my house. If you want you can come and see. You must return that extra money you took, wastage costs and everything, got it? - Okay, I'll give it back. If you come in her way again thinking your ego is hurt and that bullshit. My name is Akash. I will be everywhere above the ground. Why did you hit him? Did I tell you to hit him? You came from somewhere, you will leave after you finish your work. After that, if they come and make brawl? Who will take the responsibility for my staff safety? You don't need to hit anyone for my sake. I know how to deal with everybody. Just do your work. Understood. You won't get hug even if you help her or fought bad guys. Because she is not any cinema heroine. Hey, if girls would be impressed for fighting then, only rowdies will be having girlfriends. And if you think I beat those guys to impress Bhumi, He was talking rubbish. It didn't seem right, so I thrashed him. She didn't like it. And now she is angry. If someone helps, they should be thankful, not scold them. Shall we go? Okay. What are you doing here? - I came here to talk to sir. About what? Go now. It's urgent, mam. It is more important than 100 crores building? You can talk later. Now leave. I told you to leave. Hi. When did you guys come? Just now. Where is Bindu? I sent her back. I came here to discuss the plan and she was saying something stupid. We can talk about the plan tomorrow in the office? She is in a life and death situation. What happened, Uncle? Karthik's marriage is fixed. That boy in the office who is fair and has spectacles. They like each other. He is afraid of his family. She is tensed that he will get married because of pressure of his family. I told her I will solve that. Sorry, Uncle. - What sorry. If you don't have any feelings you think, nobody has feelings. I will talk to them. Karthik is with his family in village. I will go and talk to her. She is an orphan. They might ask her dowry. I will give that and talk to them. Karthik's family is so big. They might not accept. I will try to convince them. Okay. I will also come. Bye, Uncle. - Bye. Don't think me as a villain who is separating them. I don't want them to struggle. But, he is the only heir to this big family. And there is nothing wrong if we have some expectations for his marriage. It is not correct to make everyone suffer by only choosing his choice. He doesn't want you all to suffer. That's the main reason we are sitting here. Family should support their child to go ahead. She is all alone. That's the only reason, why I don't want him to marry her. At least there should be someone who can say something good or bad about her. When she will come to your home why do you need someone who can say about that. You all guys will be there. For every girl, marriage will make her leave her home. But, for this marriage she will get a family. Don't say dialogues as if you are in a cinema. This love and all is bullshit and this meeting is useless. Yes, love is just four words. But, it can separate two lives. Love is just loving and forgetting about it. For loving someone, it takes just one minute. But for forgetting them, whole life can't be enough. I am much younger than you, sir. It is up to you, that you break their heart, or make them marry each other. I always thought girls family should also be as big as ours. If she thinks this family as her own family then why will I not accept her? Thank you, sir. You will never come to know, that there is no one for her. Bindu's marriage responsibility is on us. What do you say, Bhumi? Okay, then. Let's do their marriage on the same date. You talked to Mr. Naidu very nicely. Thank you. Apart from this architect job, do you also lecture like this? Or did you copy it from any book? You can't even give a compliment. Oh, how beautiful this rain is. Makes me smile like a small child. While in this dreamland. Makes me happy and peaceful every time I am becoming a small child once again. I am so happy about that. Whatever step I take forward, it's going towards you. And I see you everywhere I look. I want to live with you my whole life I want to make my life happy with it. I thought I will never find a nice guy like you But I found a very nice person than that. All these years of vow came out to be fruitful This is so nice for me. Don't know, when life takes us to a beautiful journey. We don't know, when will we meet our better half. Shall we drink coffee? You said, you don't drink coffee? I want to drink now. Do you have any problem? - Why will I have any problem? Whatever you say. Do you need anything? - Dairy Milk. Dairy Milk? - Yes. Madam is so hot. Oh, she looks hotter while she is angry. Chocolate. - Did you hear what they commented on me? Yes. - You are silent even after that? The clouds, the wind, the rain will come back or not? I am glowing with happiness because of you. I had so many questions in my heart but I found every answers in you. Don't know, when life takes us to a beautiful journey. We don't know, when will we meet our better half. What happened in last meeting? Is it done? If it was okay, then why will I be in the temple. I will be in search for a good marriage marquee. So, even your matter is going slow like mine. You also didn't tell her that you love her? No, Aunty. If she is in front of me I can talk to her about anything. But expressing about my love, I am a little bit scared. Why do you need her. Do you want to see my daughter's photo? No, Aunty. I love her. I also love my daughter. When will they understand our love? What is this, Aunty? - I am writing this Ramkhut so that her marriage is done early. If this workout, please tell me. I will also write it, at least ten. Do you like her so much? Is she beautiful? She is so beautiful and always proud. How can I say you about her? She is so perfect. Does she like you? I think, she also likes me. But, she is not expressing it outside. These girls are all the same. They wait until you leave. If they have doubt that they'll miss then they will express it. I didn't get you. Idea is so good. Will it workout? Try it. What if it fails? Then you also write a Ramkhot. Prabha. - Yes. What are you doing? I am writing to Lord Rama that your marriage should be done soon. Looks like Ramudu listened to you. Now, stop writing it. What are you saying? Okay, now you don't need to visit coffee shops or any wedding websites. Why? Did you decide be a hermit? Mom. -Then what? I got whom I was searching for. And from now on, you leave this pen and start planning about marriage. What are you saying? Are you serious? Bhumi. Are you serious? Bhumi, I don't know, what is happening to me. I don't know, what to do? Should I talk to the priest? Should I call them to make the marquee. Or should I first pray God. - Prabha. Prabha. First be calm. You do everything. I must tell him first. What? You didn't say him yet? I will tell him tomorrow. Why delay doing good things? Call him right now. Sure? - First call him. Okay. He likes you, right? He didn't say me directly, but I understood. It will rain tonight. Why? You called me and asked me out. Nothing. I didn't have any work in my house. I think you are here to say something, but you are not saying it. - Nothing like that. I just wanted to meet you casually. Really? - Why are you asking the same thing? There is nothing to hide. Are you hiding anything? Nothing. I am going to village tomorrow. Oh, when will you be back? After attending few programs, I will be back once I finish it. What programs? What can I expect, when people my age go home after these many years? I am going to meet some girl. I am almost 30. My mother keeps yelling me if I don't marry now, I won't get any girl. At least I must go and see the girl, right? If you like her, then? You are okay to marry her. Aunty's idea is working out actually. Let me try a little bit. Why didn't you marry yet? You didn't get who you wanted, or nobody liked you? Do you think, it's a joke? I am a joke to you, right? What did you ask? Why didn't I marry? While tying the knot, it's not enough just to bend your head. While holding hands, it's not enough just to close your eyes. I didn't want to marry another person who I don't love. I didn't want to marry someone else leaving you. Bhumi... - Let me talk, Akash. Let me talk. How many times should I be a fool? How many more times I should be wrong in front of you? It's my mistake. It's all my mistake. I made a mistake falling in love with you before. And I made a mistake again falling in love with you yesterday. Why did I fall in love with you? I didn't forget anything. I thought, I forgot everything that happened before but once I met you again I know I was wrong. But once I saw you again, I knew I didn't forget anything. That's why, I couldn't connect to anyone. You said once that I look great in sari. And I couldn't see myself in another thing. You look great in Sari. You ran a campaign in college based on save nature. I am running a company now on that thing. "Save the nature" "Save the nature" "Save the nature" I came to know that, whatever I do , whatever I wear, you are there in part of my life. You know, what is most painful thing in girls life? That, they couldn't express their love to someone they love. That she couldn't see the future without him. If you dial a wrong number, it doesn't go to right person even if you redial it again. Bhumi. It's over, Akash. It's over. There is nothing to talk now. I think, we are not meant for each other. Though Bhumi and Akash are facing each other, they couldn't meet ever. You and I are the same. Good Bye. If you dial a wrong number, it doesn't go to right person even if you redial it again. I remember the day I met him. In fact I remember every moment when I was with him. Akash, it's three words. Six feet of form, seven years of memories. Hello. - Hi. Even here the same books. You should listen lessons in the class. Here you should learn what are not in the lessons. I will help you practice that. These engineering girls have the same problem. They see biology as something different. My guys worked very hard and cleared the traffic. If you won't give at least one kiss they will feel very bad. Just one kiss, okay? Kiss me. I searched everything, but I didn't find the author you said. Just check this. It looks fine? Who are these guys? Your classmates? Where is Shiva? Shiva. I am right here. Where did you go? I told you to be with her. I went there to prepare for supplies. What are you guys doing here? I was waiting in the canteen. What will someone do in the library? We were searching books. Where is the librarian? Here. - There he is. Good morning, sir. I told you to clear everything. Bye. You were alone here surrounded by ten idiots. I understood the situation. So... New admission? Looks like CSE. We build the buildings and they arrange the computers. Time's up. Let's go to the class. I don't believe love at first sight. But when I saw him, I was totally wrong. I felt instant connection with him. I felt like we know each other by ages. I wanted to be with him. Who was the guy that helped you. I don't know. I think he is from some other branch. At least he was there to help you in correct time. I didn't even say thanks to him. He is from the same campus, right? You can say him some other time. Where did I lost the watch? Don't worry, you will find it. Have you lost something? Yes, something very important. Is this what you were searching for? Yes. Thank you so much. You were in the library... My name is Akash. Bhumi. Bhumika. This is my friend, Anjali. Hi. - Hi. I thought I lost it. I am very happy that I got it. Why are you so excited? Nobody will take it even if you give it for free. Thank you. - You already said that. This is for helping me in the library. It's okay. I didn't even know him until yesterday. Now wherever I look, I only see him. "Save the nature" I am feeling like the whole world is bringing me closer to him. Even the watch which my father gave me. "Save the nature" "Save the nature" Give me the ball. How? What did we discuss yesterday? - Don't you remember? I want to know, you remember it or not? Who was that? Stand up. Let everybody see who that great person is? I thought it, when I heard the voice. Idiot. Tell me, what did we discuss yesterday. I am like Gajini, sir. I forget things very easily. Radha, you tell me. - Her name is Swathi, sir. Gajini can remember these things? Shameless fellow. Sit down. I won't care about the attendance, I will miss his class. Hey, keep quiet. Oh, Akash is appointed as head of the cultural fest. Wow. Congrats, man. Thanks. - Superb. Let's go, come on. - Wait for one minute. Who will help Akash as a volunteer from this class? I will help him. - Come on, let's go. What is your name? - Naya. What can you do? - Dance. Will you dance with me? - No. Give this paper to him. Hey, you are here for? - Volunteers. Hey, watch. Learn something from them. - Okay, okay. Write their names. What? Swathi won't dance? Rahul don't like dancing her on the stage. He don't want boys teasing her from the crowd. Who is he to control her? - He is his boyfriend, so. So, he won't respect his girlfriend? If you are in his place, you will do the same. If I was in his place and if my girlfriend would like to dance I would've enjoyed cheering her from the crowd. Okay, meet you later. Now what? If that dance is cancelled, our program will be flop. I will do it. Are you sure? - Yeah. I should go and practice. - Bye. All the best. Will she able to do it? - Do we have any other option? Come, come. Fast. Everybody is here, right? Okay. Go, go. Let's go. Hey, get ready. Get ready. Come on, guys. - Yeah, yeah. What are you guys doing here? Go, go. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, Naga. Just come here oh, handsome Naga. Hey, hey, hey, Naga. Just come here oh, handsome Naga. What work do I have here? What work do I have there? What work do I have here? What work do I have there? What work do I have near sandals? What work do I have near the boat? Do whatever you want or however you want. Just I need you. Just come and visit me. Or else I feel very bad. Just come and visit me. Or else I feel very bad. Just come and put your hands on my cheek. Or else I can't calm. Hey, hey, hey, Naga. Just come here oh, handsome Naga. Hey, hey, hey, Naga. Just come here oh, handsome Naga. Naga, naga, naga. Naga, naga, naga. Naga, naga, naga. Naga, naga, naga. We take the village responsibility on ourselves. Whatever comes under the umbrella, we'll carry it to the house. We take the village responsibility on ourselves. Whatever comes under the umbrella, we'll carry it to the house. We won't go back and won't see anything to do god job. If it's not for money, We don't need anything for ourselves. Just come and visit us for once. Just come and visit us. Hey, hey, hey, Naga. Just come here oh, handsome Naga. Hey, hey, hey, Naga. Just come here oh, handsome Naga. You danced very beautifully. Hello, I was the best dancer in my school. Is it? Then why didn't you say that first. We were so tensed till the last minute. I didn't want to participate. I did it for you. I didn't want the program to be flop. Oh! Anyway, I don't know whether you heard the claps or not, but I can still hear them. I felt like I was on cloud nine when he was praising me. I felt like kissing my mom because she forced me to go to dance school in childhood. Here, here. Lift it. Lift it. Nice. Madam, dance was so nice. Thank you. - What do you say guys? If audience say once more, artist will do it again, right? Just do it once more for us. Just one step. We just get to see it once, and practice and all only with him? Let's go. Madam, if you get bore with him, my door is always open. You are sad because you lost the quiz competition? Hey. Don't feel sad. It was just a small quiz. That was not a small thing. I never failed in anything. If you win always, it won't be thrilling. You must lose sometimes to enjoy the thrill of the win. Chocolate. Thank you. - You can say it by smiling. Think that was the first prize in the quiz competition. Bhumi. You look beautiful when you smile. "You look beautiful when you smile." You are doing the same thing from evening. Stop seeing yourself in the mirror. Many people said that my smile is beautiful. But I never felt this special about it. See, he gave me this chocolate. Will you frame it or what? I think, he likes me. May be you should ask him. Yes. I need to ask him. If you switch off the light, I will go to sleep. You guys here to beat me? I don't think it is nice to fight inside the college. Bhumi. Bhumi. Why are so tensed? What happened? In the ground, Dhanush's gang and Akash... Comment him again? Our boy walked away calmly, right? Back in the day, Dhanush was talking rubbish and Akash didn't even dare to fight them. He didn't even looked angry. Hello, first listen to me. Oh, did he beat them so bad? - Oh, God. You should've seen them. Why do you think he beat them? I too don't know. What are you thinking, please tell me? He beat them because Dhanush was commenting on me, right? It doesn't matter, what I think. What he thinks matters. What is this? - Shivaratri. Do you know any temple nearby? I have it in a cupboard in my room. You are looking beautiful. You are so beautiful in sari. Cinema heroes and college guys have the same reaction when they see a girl in sari. Nothing like that. I saw many girls in sari but I never told this to anyone. Today is a holiday. What are your plans? Nothing. My friends just went to the match. - You are not going? One second. Hello. Yeah. Okay. Will you say it? Okay. Girlfriend? Just like her. Mother. Seriously, do you have any girlfriend? No. - Sure? Why are you asking that? You look handsome, talk nicely. Even you fight when it's necessary. In simple words, you look like a hero. Oh, is it? Nobody else felt it that way I guess. Nobody is there in my heart. It's true. Please just don't be stuck in my heart. Just come out from the lips and say what is in your heart. Please just don't be stuck in my heart. Just come out from the lips and say what is in your heart. Until how many years, should I wait. I can feel you everywhere around me. When I ask ladies about you they just dream about you evrytime. Just tell him what is in your heart. Please just don't be stuck in my heart. Just come out from the lips and say what is in your heart. Please just don't be stuck in my heart. Just come out from the lips and say what is in your heart. Come here, I will tell you something you don't know. I never felt anything like this before what I feel about him. You do this small things and I feel great about it. My every step, will start with you every morning. From now onwards my every sight, will only wait to see your smile. Just like gum I want to be with you I feel something in my heart when you are around me. Please just don't be stuck in my heart. Just come out from the lips and say what is in your heart. Please just don't be stuck in my heart. Just come out from the lips and say what is in your heart. Hello, paper? Sorry, sir. - Okay. What if, Akash is also confused to ask me out? I will ask him whether he likes me or not. Don't think, just ask him. Can girls take the first step? Do you want to wait for few years? Hey, are you able to understand what am I saying? Just think about your parents. Remember, how many hopes your parents must have on you. You didn't study all this for her, right? You are a lucky fellow. Don't feel bad, because she rejected you. Be happy. If I was in your place, I would've been so happy. I would've partied all night thinking my future didn't stop here. You would've known if you fall in love with someone. Yes. I never loved anyone nor I will love anyone. What is there in this love. Just giving flowers and talk with each other the whole night. You can get girlfriend anytime in your life. But think about your goal, if you miss now, you can't reach it. Whatever is lost, we can get it later. But if you waste your time, it won't come back. I never wasted time till now, also I will never waste my time in this useless things like love. Bhumi. You are leaving? Even I have a flight in the evening. What else? - Nothing. I came here to say, bye. Yeah, yeah. Bye, Bhumi. Don't know, when we will meet again. Okay, be in touch. Bye. I felt like he was directly saying to me. Whatever he said to him, I felt it was just for me. Few questions are answered without even finding the answer. Now I know, what Akash has in his heart. I felt happy before when he said no one is in his heart. But I understood that, even I am not there in his heart. If we read the book again and again will the story change in the end? If you think it will change, then you are a fool. If you imagine, then it is waste of time. What happened? Did you tell him? What did he say? Did he say okay? No, mom. He is not correct for me. - What happened? Didn't he like you? Leave him. Just say one word, I will bring more handsome and nice guys then him. Just leave it, mom. This marriage and all is not my thing. What do you mean? You won't marry? I believed you and I completed my vows even. Then start again. Oh, God, help us. You were ready like a doll. Prabha. What are you saying? Come down. Come. Responsibilities are same for mother and father over their children. But, in this house it is not the same. Even if you are not interested in marrying your daughter, at least did you think about it? I am not interested, I am not in a hurry nor I take the responsibility, okay? Do we just make children just to marry them, Prabha? You are right. Marriage is necessary, but that is not the only thing that's important. We want to see our children happy. We see them grow big, make them educate and give them whatever they need. Why do we do it to them? Just to marry them with someone? We do all this because we want to see them live happily. Why can't we wait, till they search for themselves? Why can't we know their choices, Prabha? Why can't we give the same amount of time to a girl like we give to a boy. Why do we hurry only for girls marriages? If we ask them, people say, what will society think. If we marry her in some place where she is not happy who will suffer in the end? When a girl turns 13, you should sanction her. If she turns 25, just marry her with someone and loose the burden. I can't think like an outmoded father. In my eyes, I am not a failure If I don't do her marriage. I can't make her marry where she doesn't want to marry. Not until, if there's a situation where I am ashamed let anybody think whatever they want. I really don't care and I mean it. Morning, Daddy. - Hey, morning. Daddy, I am going to Araku for one week for Bindu's marriage. Good, good. Enjoy. She is helping in everybody's marriage, but she won't do it. We can argue and can even change the judgement but we can't change your mother's heart. It's really impossible. Mom, I am leaving in the evening. If I say no, will you stop? Now, what? I should get married, right? Mom, who can think that I should be good more than you. You see, whoever you like. Huh, really? Yes. Just see, how nice guy I will search for you. The guy who rejected you will die out of jealousy. What is that look? Give me that phone. Give me. Why are you guys so serious? Laugh. What happened to you, mam? You changed your dressing and your style. What is the fun being the same person in the marriage and in office? There should be some entertainment in one's life, right? You are giving us some shocking news. This look suits you very much, mam. Yes, mam. Looks like your age has been decreased five years. So, I have still five years left to marry? Look, they all are here. - Hey, Bhumi. Uncle. All your friends came? If you have any problem, just ask. Sure, Uncle. Where is Akash? He is.. - There he is. Come. - Hello, Akash. I was talking about you. How was your travelling? - It was nice. Okay. I thought you went to your village. How can I leave you all? Did you see the location? It is so good. If you are okay, we will make a nice couple video. Do with me, Sarla. I will also become famous. For a couple video we need a hero, not comedian. Hey, don't you know how to talk in front of everybody? They arrived just now, let them take rest. Don't feel bad. Hari. Come here. Show them their room. I should only do all the work. Come fast. I am coming, what's the hurry? He is like that. He is little slow. Not little slow. Too slow. Take that. Go to your room. Come, let's go. - Hey, Uncle didn't come yet. Just know, where are they now? Who is he? Looks like he is a brand ambassador for laziness. Hey, walk little fast. If I go fast will I get any prize? Okay, you come late but tell us where our room is. Climb the stairs and turn left. Take left after the stairs. Okay. We will go, you can bring this by noon. Okay. Did you see Bhumi. She changed her style. She is beautiful even like this. - Are you feeling happy? She changed her style because she doesn't like you. That is a bad sign. Don't get excited. You should be alert. Take this. Use it. If I want to save it I need to go to bank, if I want to use it, I need to go to shop. I don't have that much patience. Keep it, yourself. Hey. I eat everything whatever they gave us. First sorry, second sorry, Tiktok batch, I guess. Hi, Pooja. Akash. - Akash. I took that social media reel but you look like a cinema hero. Come. Weather is so good, right? I like this kind of weather. What a change, mam. All this because of this place? If there is no pressure in here, then you can be happy wherever you want. Hi, Bhumi. Sir, location is so good, right? Come we'll take a selfie. - Come, we'll take one. Why are you leaving? This is a group selfie? I am bored here. I'm going to my room. Hello, is this Bujji? - Don't you know, who you called? What's the matter? The girl you saw yesterday accepted you. I saw her yesterday, and she accepted me today? She is lagging. No. Are you driving this car or pushing? How much time will it take? Is this car or bullock cart? Already, I am driving at 100kmph. - Drive at 200kmph. If I drive it at that speed, you won't go to marriage you will go and meet God without lagging. Get down. Get down. Bloody old ladies. Can't get down and can't climb up. Why did you sit in the middle? Why to lag, so I sat first. Then they came in. I don't have change. Just wait here for five minutes. Five minutes? I won't even wait for any girl for that time. You think, I'll wait for your change? Bring the change and take the money. Everywhere there is lag. - Hey, Bujji, how are you? No, yesterday lorry hit him. This is his soul. He didn't change at all. Oh, God! These people are lagging and even I am having jetlag. Hey, man. Just bring me that water bottle. I sat just now, and you already gave me other work. That bottle. Oh, God! He is so slow, looks like even lag is lagging. Jumanji, don't work hard, son. I will go and get it. Oh, God! When will go there? It will take ten days to you to reach there? Thank God, one work is done. He is too slow man. Hi, how are you? Hey, Bujji. Why did you come this late? Normally I will go to weddings at the last moment, but this is our Karthik's wedding, so I came very early. Okay, wash your legs. I will make you breakfast. Oh, when I eat with hand why should I wash legs? Time waste. I will eat it now, itself. Oh, is this idly or bricks? He is brainless. What? - That's what I am asking you? You blocked my number. If I come and talk to you, you are just leaving. You are not even giving me time to speak. I need to talk to you. - Akash, please. I have nothing to talk. Just listen what I am saying. - I said, no. Actually, that day... I am trying very hard to forget that. Please don't remind me. - Just listen what I am saying once. I am begging you. What else do you want me to do? Should I catch your legs? Oh, oh. Hey, lag Sultan. Who kept you here for work actually? Hey, brother. Won't you introduce me to your friend? He is not my friend. He is my sir. Oh, sir use santoor or what? Who invented this marriages. This is all waste of time. Brother, you have so much lag between your feet and your head. And she doesn't even have any lag. What is this? Rose. - Why? Love. I liked you at the first sight without any lag. You also should say okay without any lag. Go ahead, please go ahead without any lag. Everybody should go without having any lag. Aunty, is everybody good? - Hey, Bujji. Without lagging you reserved first seat. Brother, you are the only person who understood me. Thank you. - Do you want to sit beside me? No, I will sit somewhere else. - Come, let's go. He is a different type of lag. I will be the very first one who will be served. Hey, start serving from this corner. Oh, my lag. What? You guys are serving from that side? For just pickle it took fifteen minutes. Just ask whatever you want. - Oh, my lag. Uncle, I can't wait for every item to come from that side. I can't control the lag. Don't worry, Bujji. - Who is it? I will send a guy who won't lag and will serve you. Thank you, brother. Hey. Oh, this guy! I think, I am not lucky today. Bhumi, why do you keep your face always angry? You know, how cute you look while you sleep like this. Oh! Why didn't I observe you like this back then? I want to say one thing, if I get any chance to rewind my life again. I will go back to our college days and I will start living again, but this time with you. But now, there is no chance of that I want to continue my life being with you. I want to experience your love. When will you show me? I have many things to say you. Not like this, I want you to hear me. While seeing in your eyes. Good night. You should've told me first. Why did you make it so complicated? If she is angry, she won't listen to anyone. I am the reason, why is she like that. She loved me so much, that she couldn't find any other person. These days, people are marrying only those whom they calculate and check if they can live rich with them or not. But she didn't even love anyone else. Without knowing I made her suffer very much. I will wait for years till she knows my love. Okay, then. Pack this. - Hey. Come here. Keep it there. See there. Hello. - How is the guy? Did you like him? Tell something. Did you change your heart again? Remember, you gave me your word. Yes, he is nice. - Should I arrange the meeting. It's up to you. Bye. Sister, they are waiting for you in the bride's room. Come. Let's go. Hello. - How are you? How is the wedding going? All good, Daddy. How are you? I am good. Your mom is so excited for your engagement. Hey, did you like him for real or you just said okay because of your mother. If you don't like him, tell me. Don't think about her. Nothing like that, Daddy. I am okay. Okay, take care. Bye, Daddy. - Bye. Sister, come fast. Music already started. Ramulo, Ramula You made me go crazy. Ramulo, Ramula She killed me. Ramulo, Ramula You made me go crazy. Ramulo, Ramula She killed me.

Bhumi, I want to talk to you. Congrats. We did it. We wanted to do their marriage together. We did it. No we don't have to act. You think, this is all just an act? Isn't it? I think, you are still angry on me. I don't think anything about you. Please, don't trouble me, Akash. What did I do? Time's up. I need to go. Why are you in hurry? Tomorrow is my engagement. This made me closer to you. If I give it back to you? I am afraid you will never meet me again. Nice. If I don't want to remember you I should not keep anything that reminds me of you. Wait, Bhumi. What? What is your problem? I need to talk to you. Just give five minutes. I don't want to talk to you. - You loved me so much. You can't give me five minutes? Just wait. Why are you leaving when I am talking to you? Won't you listen what I want to say? I didn't say it when I should've said. I didn't listen when I should've listened. You loved me, you felt it, you are breaking up, and you are leaving. Then who will think about me? Only you have feelings? I don't have it or what? Do you know, why I came here after all these years? Why am I roaming around you? Did you think about it even once? I didn't come here for any project, or any marriage function. I came here only for you. When I knew that you loved me, I couldn't stay there and I searched for you and came here. Divya, how are you? Sure, let's catch up. I am so sorry. Akash. Anjali. What are you doing here? How is your friend, Bhumi? After college, we didn't meet. - Oh! She didn't tell you but she loved you. She just used to think about you. She always tried to talk to you. At that moment I saw it from your view. I didn't want to participate. I did for you. Seriously, you don't have any girlfriend? No. After knowing that, I didn't like what I was doing? I didn't know where to find you. I didn't know what were you doing? I searched for you. I called everybody whoever I knew. I searched you in social media. You were nowhere. Where are you? You are still in love with me? Or did you forget me? Goutham. - Yes. She is in Hyderabad. She is running a startup company. Guess what? My father is funding the company. Hey, Akash. One more thing. She is not married yet. I don't know why, after hearing that, I couldn't control my happiness. I couldn't stay there any longer. I thought you will be excited when you see me. But, when I saw you behaving so casually I didn't know how to react. I thought you moved on. I wanted to observe you very closely, so I took up this project. I felt very attractive when I saw you changed totally. You were like totally a new person. So, I loved you. I just wanted to know what you think about me, so I lied about the bridesmaids. I listened that you loved me. But that was first time I saw, how you felt about me. I made you feel very sad. You left that night, I thought you were angry on me. I was waiting that you will come back. But, you are leaving this watch... now I can understand, you left me on that day itself. I thought I understood your love very late, but now I get that, it is very late. This is a small project. - I am saying I'll do it. I need to talk to you. Akash, please. I don't want to talk to you. Oh, love. Oh, love. Why all this struggle? Sister, Akash is leaving. Why do you break hearts like this? Why do you break hopes of people? Call Akash. Oh, Love. Why do you do this to everybody? Mom is waiting, Uncle. I need to go. Why do we need this unbreakable freedom ? Sarla, bring the bag. Oh, Love, Oh, Love. My heart is wrecked This is a dream This is like river which never stops flowing and you don't even feel pity. Oh, Love. You already came? Come here. Let's go. Bhumi. They will arrive anytime soon. Get ready. Go Bhumi. Please smile, Madam. You look beautiful when you smile. Did you connect at first sight? If you love someone, let them know. You should know, what he thinks about it. You didn't even question and you are waiting for an answer. How will you know? Go. Already you guys waited for so long. What is all this, Prabha? Hello, Aunty. - Son. The girl you love... Is her name Bhumi? Yes, Aunty. Did you guys study in the same college? How do you know? Her love is very pure. That made Akash come here. I just helped them be together. At last, you daughter is marrying and you are sending her. I am not sending her after the marriage. She must need someone to guide her. You gave me the watch and you left? You decided you wanted to leave me. No chance. However you cut me. I was about to go and meet your parents. In the mean time aunty called me and asked about us. So, now we are here after that. When you came here, why didn't you meet me directly? Why do you think your client kept the meeting in the hotel where I stay? He told he will be coming but he was not there. Why? So, that was all your plan? You look innocent but you are not. What can I do? I wanted to see the love you were hiding. You waited for me this long. I should at least fight this, right? Hello, I didn't wait for you. Just, I didn't connect to anybody. Why are you laughing? You didn't have this ego in college. You made me like this. You didn't even say it yet. - What? That you like me. - Wait for that. How long? Till that sky meets the land. I will your mom, she will do it easily.
