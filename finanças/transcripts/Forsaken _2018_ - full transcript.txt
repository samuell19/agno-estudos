Often, looking back, one is faced with a single question. Was it all worth it? Ship to Earth, over. All onboard systems are operating in the green. Were our discoveries worth those efforts, those sacrifices, all for the sake of victory? Vertical descent 12 meters. What pushed us to need this victory? The thirst for knowledge? Our natural curiosity? Or perhaps our vanity? Report your status. Earth, we're ready for landing. Ladies and gentlemen, your pilot thanks you for choosing Air Mars. It's been a lovely 256 days of flight. Please bring all seats and tray tables to their full up-right and locked position and remain in your seats until your spaceship comes to a complete stop. All telemetry is normal and landing process is a go. Pitching 45 degrees. Copy, proceed. Attention all crew, beginning descent. When there was nowhere left to discover on Earth, man conquered the moon, and then man wanted more. There was an unbearable thirst for new worlds to explore. So man looked to the sky, and man saw Mars, and we went. And now we ask ourselves that same question. "Was it all worth it?" Weather conditions reading normal. 20,000 meters and closing. We've entered the upper layers of the thermosphere. New report. 19,000 meters, continuing descent. Earth, Earth, do you read me? Detecting abnormal movement on the surface of the planet. What is it? Can you see it? Do you hear me? Come in. It looks like a tornado. We shouldn't get near that. Postpone the drop. Peter, Peter! What the hell is going on? Earth, come in. Earth, can you hear me? Get me an image from the weather balloon. Mars, answer me. The funnel is 21 kilometers tall, 900 meters across. Alert triggered from the pressure sensor. Abort the landing! This is a direct order. Get out of there. Hold back? Are you mad? I've already made a statement. We cannot fail this mission. Earth, confirm landing termination. We're about out of time. Activate stabilizers. We've got to pull you out of there and stop the descent. We can't do anything on our side. Turn on those emergency engines. Engines at full power. We don't have nearly enough pull. 50,000 feet and falling. Controls not responding. The signal won't go through. They have to take control manually. Mars, Mars. The system is failing and we have to drop you into manual control now. Manual control system is down. Earth, do you read me? Earth, awaiting orders. Damn it. Alexander, here. Attention, attention, all stations. Launch the return program right now. Undocking main cabin. Commencing the release of main cabin. 7,500 Meters. Undocking left module. Your automatic undock is failing, it's just too damaged. You're going to have to trigger it from there. We can only undock it from within but that means someone has to stay behind. Sulev. Ready commander. You're in charge. Max, I need you to listen to me. As soon as I get inside the module, I'm going to block the door behind me. Commander. Listen, as soon as I block the door and undock the module you'll have exactly four seconds. No more. Sasha, you have to be ready to trigger the next step. And there's no way back in. If you don't, we'll all die here. Commander? Max, I know you can do this. Get them home. Commander. Commander, come in. It's finally happened and our brave astronauts have reached the red planet after 260 days of flight. We're here at mission control with the man in charge of the entire operation to shed some light on the international Mars mission. The director of the MCC Alexander Kovalev. Sir, do you have any words about the mission? People of the world. This is one of the most joyful days in human history. For soon, you will see, man first set foot on Mars. In just a few short hours, our astronauts will be setting up their laboratory module on Mars. This is only the first step to installing a permanent station and presence on the surface of the red planet. After that we'll bring the ship home and prepare for the next mission. Of course, we have some temporary supplies in the module. Sasha and I used to dream of flying amongst the stars. But even then, I couldn't imagine that my friend would be the first person to set foot on Mars and that it would be the worst thing to ever happen to me. Alexander, the reporters are outside. If you want me to... That's okay. Chapaev, earth to Chapaev, confirm. Chapaev, if you're there, respond. Come in. Today at 5:30 PM Moscow time during the first stages of the landing, unforeseen circumstances caused a disaster. Upon further review, our scientists have attributed this to an anomalous, dust tornado. Mission commander Alexander Chapaev, in an effort to save his ship and crew, made a call. He entered the module and manually unlocked it, freeing it from the ship. At the cost of his own life, Alexander Chapaev saved the lives of his crew. In the aftermath of such a catastrophe, I made a decision to terminate the mission. I must bring our people home. Mars, Mars. Please respond. Earth to Mars, respond. Mars, Mars. Please respond. Anyone, respond. Russia has lost a great son in Commander Chapaev. Alexander. What's wrong. We have a connection. Is this an actual confirmation? Quiet! What's going on? You're alive. Quiet! We thought we had lost you. I can hardly believe it. All right, we'll start on a tight shot on me and then zoom back onto the screen. Behind me on the news here. Alexander Chapaev... According to the data, the module fell and exploded. Some sort of miracle, but we're all happy for it. Indeed, all's well, that ends well. Not quite. The main part of the station is gone, along with the residential section as well. Only the lab module actually survived the crash. The rest of the ship just barely managed to stay in orbit. Minister, we're incredibly lucky. The next planned mission is about 30% ready. If we pick up the pace we could launch a year early. You are personally responsible for this expedition. We can bring him home but we're going to need more funding. His life is on the line and... You want more funding? Are you out of your mind? Maybe you missed the half a trillion we just spent to send a man mission to Mars. What more do you think we can spend, another half trillion to bring home one single astronaut? Roman hey, so this thing is a complete disaster. First, the ship explodes then it didn't explode. Now the astronaut is alive, apparently. It's too much. How about a show about an Astro dog? We can call it "Mating." Gregory, my boy. You just don't understand. You've got to listen to me. None of this is going to work. It's going to be on every news channel. So no one's going to watch. Keep fishing, Gregory. You'll catch something. Yes. Hello, Alexander. Who is this? My name is Roman A. Randolph. I'm president of a television corporation. Congratulations on the survival of your spaceman. I must say, well done. And why are you calling me? I have an idea I would like to discuss with you, privately. Welcome, Alexander, take a seat. The weather is just delightful today. What do you want? All right. Here's my thought. I would like to create a television show around your astronaut, a live broadcast from another world. Nothing like this has ever been done on TV. Imagine the sensation. Well, what do you think? Mr. Randolph. Maybe you don't realize what happened out there. Over 59 million miles away on the planet Mars, a man is fighting for his life. Yes, yes, yes. We don't know how long he can survive. Yes, yes, yes. You misunderstand me, sir. I can assure you all proceeds would go towards the rescue of your stranded friend. And I would like for you to explain this to Chapaev personally. This show is arranged for him. I would never impose, Alexander. The decision is, of course, yours. Now is your chance to let the world know we do not abandon our people. Attention, all services, recheck all module systems, prepare and refit all timelines for rescue mission preparations. Operations group to my office. All right. What do we know? Only two sections remained intact after the incident with the module. Of those only one is functioning. Pathfinder autonomous robotic discovery system has been activated. How about the Rover? The readings say it's intact. An extra pair of eyes never hurt. That's the best chance we have of examining the module's crash site. We need to know the landscape and climate conditions of the region. This has to be a top priority. Moving on, what's the status on life support? The oxygen argon mixture should last 30 months. 10 tons of water that should last 30 months, too plus the closed loop cleaning system. How about food? He doesn't have much in the way of supplies, but synthesis experts are thinking... Timeline, years, months. What are we talking? 30 months, sir. What about communications? Yeah, uh. We can try, but as a result of the tornado, the module ended up thousands of miles off from the intended landing location. We don't know much about the area save that it's plagued by increased sandstorm and tornado activity. And there's no direct visibility from our satellites. We can't see anything. We need absolute certainty on this. We'll do our best. Our biggest problem is energy supply. The main nuclear reactor was damaged in the crash with our best estimates, the energy reserve will only last 13 months. 13 months to live. When can we launch a rescue mission? We can have a new ship ready to launch in 190 days. That would be the ideal time to launch as the phases of Earth and Mars will be in sync. Plus seven and a half months of flight. We'll have to fly in parabola. There's some current research in America and China we can use. If we are able to use their tech we can be there in 13 months and have commander Chapaev on his way home. Will he survive? It's possible, though his reserves will be incredibly sparse. Of course he'll survive. He's been in training to handle this. My only worry, we have to warn him of the possibility of psychological symptoms, isolation and sensory starvation. Hallucinations could begin any time. Onset of delusion... That's enough. We need an idea to save him. I don't care if it takes a delusion or a hallucination. Now get back to work. Unusual movement detected. Unidentified object. Alexander. Sasha. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? How do you feel? I feel... how I feel. I'm fine, I guess. As the psychologist for this mission, it's important for me to monitor your condition. It's important to talk. You're afraid I'll lose my mind, aren't you? I'm really okay. Don't worry. Just a few words. Sir, just a few words. What are the next steps for the program? Can you comment on your decision to... I have no comment. You can wait for the press conference. Have you talked to Chapaev? I have. Does he understand what this show is asking of him? In general terms. Okay, I'll talk to him myself. This is a great opportunity. You'll be a celebrity. Everyone will know you. Sasha, people have long dreamed of going to Mars. And we did. Hold on, son. Think about this. We're all with you. We're in this together. Hardly. Well, That's fair enough. I understand. - Ladies and gentlemen. - Excuse me, sir. It is my pleasure to say with full confidence that the Martian expedition was a complete success. What do you say, Sasha? Claim victory through giving in. I'll get you home. I know you will. All of the tasks that were assigned to the crew have been completed. The module that will become our station has been installed. And the ship, along with its three crew members is on the way home. And what of Commander Chapaev? Our astronaut is alive and well and we will do everything in our power to bring him back home. Other questions? Did the commander agree to this show? Of course, as a matter of fact, he's incredibly excited. Hello, Roman? Your people have completely violated our agreement. We weren't designed for this. It's TV, darling. I'm doing all I can for the sake of the astronaut. How are you? I have to figure out where to put all these people. I'm sure you'll figure it out. I hope that tomorrow during the show, your astronaut performs well. Hey Alexander. So are you ready for tonight? What the hell is this? Mr. Martian? What's up? You nervous? Of course you are. Don't worry. I get it. It's a lot of attention. So, let me give you a piece of advice. You want to make a good show and get the people to watch? Just do exactly as I say it and don't try to wing it, all right? Do you have any idea what you're going to say? Oh yeah. You betcha. People want to have fun and relax, but they always gotta be stimulated. Things get old. They want something fresh and new. And this little Mars thing is just what they need. But you got to talk about what's going on down here on Earth. Endgame, just stick to the script. Hello, everybody! Ready to hear a voice from the edge of space? Our man on Mars. Over 59 million kilometers away. The farthest the mortal man has ever been. Are you ready to make television history? Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to present to you, the man at the edge of the universe, the Islander himself, the Robinson Crusoe of the 21st century, Alexander Chapaev. My friends, so you will be the lucky first to speak to the man on Mars? Let me hear you. Good morning, Earth. Today's weather is fairly sunny. Despite being minus 52. Today on Mars, we expect a sand storm and possibly a hurricane. The night will remain chilly, sitting at a crisp minus 80. Movement recorded. It's partly cloudy. I don't think it's to rain anytime soon. Movement recorded. Now to the news here. First up. No political news. No wars, no disasters, 'cept the hurricane. No robberies or murders. Believe it or not. Mars is at peace. Nobody tried to attack anyone, no fighting or division on the red planet. The entire population is alive and well, and their representative is in high spirits. Earth. Are you all right? Did you hear that? What exactly did you hear? Nothing, sorry. Just some static. Listen to me. What the heck do you see in this guy? It's not working. We gotta replace them before it's too late. How about that other show I was pitching. You do not understand, my dear. Chapaev is not the main character here. The wonder is a character between life and death. That's what's fascinating. That is what draws them in. Life and death. And the show is broadcast live. Roman, I get it. No, no, I totally get it. Let him babble. Let him babble all he wants. As long as the audience feels the pity. Oh yeah. The show Martian has become an incredible success and spread around the world. People have believed for ages that Mars could hold life. It's my sincerest hope to prove it. It's much like... Mars is, as you know, the fourth planet that orbits around our sun. Hey, what's wrong with the picture? Put some more lights up in that module. It was named Mars... He can't, that's energy. He has to conserve it. Someone needs to conserve it, but I don't. Go to commercial. And this, my dear friends, is a real Martian-made onion. On Earth, I hated them, but here it's still awful. Even on Mars. Although... No, still bad. Roman, you really got to see these ratings. They doubled. Gloomy craters, red lights and aliens with blasters. That's how filmmakers have seen Mars for ages. But now there is someone actually there. Someone who can see of every theory we've had is true because he can see it with his own eyes. I see, you're really getting into the spirit. I wonder if I should start worrying about my job, huh? Uncle Sasha, why do people exist? In order to do something new, to think new thoughts, to make the world a little better. I'm gonna say new things like Uncle Sasha says. The constantly increasing popularity of the show Martians is absolutely striking. Hey, how 'bout a bite? All right, Help me out, Kelly. Do you spell schizophrenia with an S or with a Z? The polls are back and it looks like Alexander Chapaev has joined his predecessor, Yuri Gagarin as one of the most famous names on Earth. Anna? Did I snore? Chapaev. I can't wait for you to finally come home. Maybe that's enough for today? I mean... You can't work all the time. Just another few minutes. Really? I'll head home in just a bit. Yeah. I'll just wait outside for you then. Okay? Okay. I think you've got to watch out for that. You see? This is what I mean. That's your wife? Yeah, no, almost. Almost? You know it's easy to make a woman happy but not cheap. Okay. Three broadcasts every day is insane. The only chance he has for survival is if he uses his resources sparingly. Sir, this won't hold. We have to do something. More time is passing by every day. You think I don't know? So what are we going to do then? We do what we have been doing. Chapaev is burning through power at full capacity. If this keeps up he'll burn through it quickly. I congratulate you darling. Our idea is a stunning success. Yeah, yeah. Every broadcast siphons away three days he has to live. There is nothing more important than his survival. We need to cut down the number of broadcasts. And I believe we should increase the number. The math here is very simple. The more we broadcast, the closer we come to a rescue. It is now been two months and the entire world is working to save your friend. But what of you? There is no hope in pity, Alexander. You are in charge. This is your decision, make it. The show must go on. Hey, Anna, someone told me a great joke the other day. So, Chapaev, he gets to Mars, right? And he hears this knock. So he's scared, of course, right. And he, uh. So he's all freaked out and he goes to answer the door and show he shouts out the door... Can you help me, please? Are you white? No, I'm red. Oh no, I got it wrong. Sorry. Not, not red. Green, green. You know like little green man. So there was this foreign correspondent and asks me. Oh, who is Mr. Chapaev. So I'm like, Mr. Chapaev, huh? He's a, he's the hero in a bunch of jokes. So I told her the one, the one with the, the, the green men. What? Why did you stop? Come on. You were doing so great. What do you think? In order to increase revenue from the show, we'll have to increase energy use. That's the idea. It's up to you. What's there to think about? We stay strong. You hold on. Put all of that back. Don't touch anything. - Put it down right now. - Anna. Everything's under control. We're increasing the number of broadcasts. What are you saying? Chapaev is already overworked. He's on the brink. It's my medical opinion at this point that he can't... I'm on the brink, too, Anna. There is nothing else we can do. So, calm down. He's already agreed to it. You don't get what he's going through. You can't possibly understand Alexander. I did understand that Sasha needed a rest, but we were so obsessed with saving him that we chose not to notice his pain. Tracking, now. Seven dash two five. Seven dash three four. Eight dash one five... Movement recorded. Attempting source identification. Nope, nothing there. Sasha. Come home, Sasha. Come home. Sasha. Mom. Look, friends. This is our universe. It is full of mysteries. You can see giant stars, frigid comets and it flies in the vacuum through eternity and space. You know about Earth. You know that it is one of millions of planets in the Milky Way Galaxy. There is so much more, so many unknown things. Roman, you genius. Your idea to grow and expand the audience was brilliant. I didn't believe it until I saw it, but Chapaev was 100% on board with the kids show. He actually was excited about it. Since the dawn of time, man has looked up into the stars in the night sky to unravel the many mysteries of the universe. Everything out there calls out to humankind and it frightens us. Isn't there anything better to watch? You see that's exactly why we came to Mars. We were searching, searching, hoping to find the answer somewhere to that eternal question. Who are we? Where did we come from? Where are we going? To reveal the mystery of our universe. - Uncle Sasha. - Are there any aliens on Mars? From my very first day on Mars I believe that I heard some sounds. A voice, as though someone was trying to communicate with me. And what's happening to me now is the greatest scientific event of our time. I know now that we are not alone. He hears voices? Has he lost it? My friends, I am not alone. Yes, Alexander? Is Sasha doing all right? I don't know. Come to the MCC. - I'll be there in 10. - Okay. Breaking news from Mars. Alexander Chapaev has made contact with extraterrestrials. Of course, all this contact with alien consciousness is insane. And what's almost more insane is that he believes it. We'd always considered ourselves rational scientists, which could only mean our Sasha had a mental break. It's understandable and predictable and it confirmed our worst fears. Now we had to worry about how far off the edge he had fallen. Drop us at the back. How far indeed. Never had the mysteries of the red planet seemed so close at hand. It's a miracle. What's he going on about? What the hell is he talking about? I'm trying to work it out, too. Alexander, please. I need to speak with him. In private. These sounds it's like they say what's inside me. What I feel. As though I'm the cause, they're the consequence. It's like, they were a reflection of my, of my state of mind. Does that make any sense? The truth is there's nothing. There's no reality of time. There's no Mars. Like maybe we just created all this. Now we're just struggling to comprehend. We create universes. We create planets. We create harmony or we purge it, we destroy. And now I think I may be the reason this is happening here on Mars. And I think it's possible that humans are the cause of so much on Earth. It's said there are too many of us on that planet and I'm here alone. Sasha, can you tell me about the sounds you're hearing? You said they're like music, right? Yeah, I can send you a recording. What kind of music? What kind of music? This music, it's... it's inside of me, bound to me. For example, if I'm angry... So you hear this when you're stressed or frustrated? Oh, I see you think I'm crazy. Sasha, that's simply what happens when you're alone for a long time. Don't worry. - It's not serious. - Wait. How many hours have you slept? That's not important. There, do you hear it? It's the music. Do you hear it? Sasha. The music is just a creation of your mind. The only sound that is coming through to us is your voice. I only hear you Sasha and nothing else. I need you to trust me, okay? Do you trust me? Do you? - Hey, Anna. - Yes? - Hey. - Good morning. Is he ready for today's show? Peter, go to work. Don't you have anything else to do? Oh yeah. See you later. Triangulating. Five dash five, four. Five dash four seven, Three dash three dash nine. Movement recorded. Unknown source. Movement recorded. Commercials are done, intro ready, now. Three, two... Welcome, my friends. It's time to catch up with our man on Mars. Of course our intrepid hero doesn't need an introduction, but why not? I bring live to you all the way from the constellations, Alexander Chapaev. Alexander, I'm sure you know how shocked we all were to hear that you made contact with an alien life form. We need to know the truth. So tell us, is there life on Mars? Nothing to say, huh? All right, let's talk about you. Alexander, if only you knew how jealous we all are. You're up there, no traffic jams, no lines. Fresh air, fresh planet, the sun, the sand. How do you feel, my friend? How was it up there in the new world? Well, have you ever been lost in the woods? Think of it. It's sudden when you realize that you're truly lost. You worry, you scream. You try to find your way, and then eventually... ...silence, because you're alone. Think of what you would do to see one person, one face. Anyone in the world at all, any face in the crowd. Alexander, my friend. Why are you so sad? We're with you. We're coming to get you. Alexander, we believe in you. We have hope. We are waiting for you to come home with glorious stories from the constellations. Our own man from Mars. Chapaev, come in. I'm here. Are you okay? We scheduled the session and you know the rules. Take a minute and come back on. I don't have time for this. Chapaev had tried to tell us time and time again that he had encountered something strange on Mars, but it was easier to imagine he was insane than to try to understand. So, of course, he considered us insane. Earth was getting farther away from him and Mars was getting closer. There's no way. What in the? If this is true. Anna, it's about Chapaev. We really need to talk. Look, that's enough. You realize that talking to him is my job. You do see that don't you. And I'm going to keep talking to him, all right? No, I understand. It's it's not about that. It's, it's... So what is it now? About our relationship, or you or me? Do you realize that something serious is going on up there? That may be with him forever. They think I'm crazy, but I hear it. I can hear the sounds. There's something going on. Something's wrong. She's right. It's just because I'm alone. Mars, we can't hear you. Maybe it's just a dream. Maybe there's no Mars. Alexander, my friend. Why so sad? We're with you. Hallucinations. It's all nothing. It's just a hoax. It's just a mind game. No, no that's not true. Mars, We're coming for you. It's okay, Sasha, I'm coming for you. Were we are, there is the victory. This is a great opportunity. People have long waited to see the red planet. Maybe they're right, maybe I have gone mental. There are no sounds, Alexander. Do you trust me? Trust me. I heard the sounds. I know I heard them. I understand. I must see it for myself. If I don't, I'll truly be mad. All right, let's get this up on screen. What the heck's going on? Hey, bring up the modular feed on that screen. How much does he have left? Commercials are ending, bumper is back. Sound. And now camera. Starting again in five. Ladies and gentlemen, the show must go on. A man thrown 59 million kilometers from anything he's ever known, alone on an alien planet. Our hero, Alexander Chapaev. What's going on? Commander. Alexander. So you're playing hide and seek? Not exactly a great time. Your public is waiting. I don't get it. What's going on? Are you there? Please, Alexander, we need to talk. Good afternoon, Gregory. Do you see that? It looks like your goldfish has gone belly up and drowned. What are you talking about, my darling? He's even stopped taking calls from the shrink. Probably easier to send me to Mars than bring the show back. That's a fantastic idea. Just what we'll do. Not good, Roman. Looks like our lucky run with Commander Chapaev is over. My dear minister, I am inclined to disagree. All that we have done so far was merely preparation for the main act. The true profits. I'm intrigued. Profits come not in money, but in power, limitless power. And just how do you figure that? The world trusts Chapaev. If he were to, say, support you, the world itself would be in your pocket. Perhaps but, he's a bit unhinged. Minister, I assure you. If you do as I tell you, I'll be able to cut a deal. This is only the beginning. Only the beginning. And I'm here alone. Sasha, can you tell me about the sounds you're hearing? You say they're similar to music, right? Yeah, I can send you a recording. What kind of music? What kind of music? This music, it's inside of me. This music, it's inside of me, bound to me. For example, if I'm angry... So you hear this when you're stressed or frustrated. Oh, I see. You think I'm crazy. Looks like I'm sleeping alone tonight. Sasha, that's simply what happens when you're alone for a long time. Don't worry, it's not serious. Trust me. Do you trust me? Do you trust me? Ah, yeah? Okay, I understand. Looks like I'm not sleeping at all tonight. Attention, attention. Movement recorded. Non protein origin detected. Hey Sasha. Look, you need a shave. What if you encounter a pretty Martian girl? Seems like nothing I do is working. We have something we're going to try. What are you going to do? No need for you to know the details. What there's no need for is your presence. I make the decisions here. Not anymore. I do. - Novokov. - Yes? Prepare the connection. Okay. Movement recorded. Anomalous phenomenon registered in atmosphere. Analysis beginning. Analysis impossible. Anomalous activity registered in atmosphere. It's ready. All right, let's begin. I want to talk to him. Chapaev, can you hear me? I have a little proposal for you. It would be best if you'd agree. Mulder the alien it's inside me. Don't worry, Scully. It is mine. - People have been asking. - What's going on with him? Is there life on Mars? - I can tell you. - I don't know. - With absolute certainty, - But it's good. That yes, there is. I haven't seen him like this in a while. I'd like to introduce my Martian friend. So, how's life on Mars. Chapaev style. Just you wait and see. Chapaev style, it is your life. Chapaev style, it is your destiny. Stop, now you be you. Chapaev Style. The new show from the most popular man in the galaxy. Where he will reveal the secrets of his success. You'll learn how to look, how to move, what to believe and how... to... live. Chapaev Style is your choice. To be the man you gotta be like the man. Chapaev Style is your destiny. Alexander Chapaev is unbelievable. Chapaev Style is more than life. It is the philosophy of the universe. Millions of fans can't be wrong. The crew of the first Mars expedition has at last returned to Earth today. The Soyuz spacecraft with its three astronauts has landed on the steppes of Kazakhstan. Their arrival has coincided with the release of the new collection from their commander Alexander Chapaev. Chapaev Style, know it, wear it. Tell me everything. Oh, Anna, wow. Tell me what is going on. What? Do you think I didn't know? What are you talking... I already know. I just need you to tell me the details. The details of what? Did you think I wouldn't see the change? What did you do? Oh that. You know, maybe you and your patient should both take the same pills to relax and calm... Shut up. You coward. For once in your life why don't you act like a man? Look at yourself. You will tell me. He wasn't delusional. There were sounds in the recording. What? Listen, please I have to talk to him. I can't, they've blocked all forms of communication. Please, you have to connect us. That's not possible. I don't exist. I don't exist. Anomalous phenomenon registered in atmosphere. Source identification. Attention, danger. Energy overload. Radiation leak. Come on, come on faster. Tracking movement. Zone seven dash two five seven dash six seven dash three one. Eight dash one four. Anomaly cannot be identified. Malfunction detected. Malfunction. Malfunction. Path, no. I'm listening. It's about Chapaev. I also wanted to speak about him. I have many exciting ideas for our commander. What sort of ideas? And he's all mine. The Chapaev brand belongs to me and I'm free to do it at whatever I please. Oh, in this case, all the responsibility lies upon you. As well as the rewards. Of course, you shall have everything. The show must go on. Mr. Minister. We have to talk right now. We need your signature here, sir. It's approvals for the outdoor advertising campaign. Are all my notes included? Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you. What do you want? We've collected plenty of revenue from the show and we need to start executing a rescue mission immediately. Alexander, I know you're no fool, but you are truly naive. That was never any chance of a rescue for Commander Chapaev. From the beginning, you must have known. No, wait listen. You will listen to me, Alexander. What chance do we have of a rescue crew being any more successful than this disaster was? Chapaev is a regrettable casualty. The Mars program is shut down. You're finished. Everything we did to bring him home has been in vain. He, the minister has sentenced Chapaev to nothing but a slow death and I don't know how to stop it. Are you asking me for help? Rather cute. Tell me, can you wait until tomorrow? Yes. Well, that's just lovely. Tomorrow will be a better day. You'll see. Everyone to places. Gregory, you ready? - Stop screwing around. - All right, let's do this. Action. Friends, Earthlings. I want to speak to you today about your presidential candidate. A man I infinitely trust and honor. Believe me. From here, from Mars, I can see. This is a man worthy of leading our nation, our world. He's changed not only my life, but Mars. And he will lead you and you, you to a bright, you to a bright future-future-future. The hell? Get the bumper up right now. Stay where you are. Hands on the ground. Get down now. Get down, face down. Nobody move. More on our breaking story of the hoax of Martian, where today a computer generated Chapaev was discovered. The investigation begins in earnest. The MCC will remain under heavy guard and the staff detained for further interrogation. We'll keep you updated as we discover more. The president has made his instructions to the security forces very clear. They are to investigate, identify, ensure the monsters behind this fraud are brought to justice. No crashed astronaut. Who could have imagined that this entire thing, the show that brought the world together was nothing more than an elaborate scam meant to defraud the public. Well somebody's going to have to answer for this. It's over. Our hopes had vanished into thin air. I couldn't keep my word. I couldn't save him. And I had to be the one to tell him. Turn us around right now. Out of the car! What's going on here. I have just received a call and was given word that the primary suspect has been captured and detained. Alexander Mikalavich. I'm sorry. Your pass is invalid. Finally, The truth of the expedition to Mars has become clear. Unexpected weather during the initial stages of the landing on Mars led to the loss of the module and the unfortunate death of astronaut Commander Alexander Chapaev. MCC leadership in charge of the expedition was unwilling to accept such failure and made the decision to falsify reports... Your hands, sir. Such a shame. Only yesterday they were so fond of Chapaev. They marveled at every word he said and now they believe that they hate him. The question is why? Because they do not exist. Look at that man. Working hard. Does he know where he's going? Why he lives? Tell me, what if he doesn't? Where does he turn to find out who he loves? Who he hates, What to buy. And as for Chapaev. He doesn't exist. He never did. He never did. Are you all right? Peter. Hey there, Martian. Please forgive me. Back here on Earth, we've lost our humanity. You gave us a chance to see. You don't exist. There was no module, no landing, no research on Mars. Truth be told, you died a few months ago. Some training accident. This is all smoke and mirrors. You don't exist. If you could give us some sort of sign. I'm so sorry. There is nothing I can do. I... exist. Auto destruct sequence has been enabled. Awaiting passcode. Passcode received. Breaking news now in from the surface of Mars. Satellites have detected an explosion in the area known as the Cupid Plateau. Many experts agree that this is the module that remained from the international Mars mission. Some are taking it as a clear sign that the astronaut Alexander Chapaev was still alive on Mars. Despite it all, I believe that Chapaev did meet him, the one who spoke to him, the one he was searching for. The one who changed him. Only now do I begin to understand that we created this reality and we're trying to comprehend it. We are more than human. In a way, we are aliens and we have come to this world to change it. We are a part of this universe and we can destroy everything. Or we can create. We are the cause of all our problems just as each of us is the cause of all that is happening in our life. And who, if not us, could change this life, this world... and tell this universe that I exist.
