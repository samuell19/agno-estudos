Good morning. I... Forgive me Mr. Reinhart, but we have a new student today. This is Darby Peters. Darby is a transfer student from Lake Forest High School, and she has the privilege of beginning her first day here at school with all of you. Darby it's nice to have you in class. Why don't you sit right up here, seat in the front row, okay? Good morning, and welcome to the morning edition of Point of View. My name is Craig Johnson and I'll be your host for this morning's controversy. I was gonna talk about abortion but, homicide seems like a real ugly way to start the day. So I thought I'd take on the School Prayer Initiative. Now there's been a lot of debate lately about whether or not the mandatory prayer bill should be passed, and believe it or not I've done a lot of thinking about this issue and I plan to be simple, clear and to the point in answering the question should there be mandatory prayer during school. No. That's right, you heard me, no. Now it's no secret that I'm one of those Christians and I guess this all surprises you a little bit. Some of you have even seen me praying in school. I even pray in this class. Usually right before a test. See the way I see it, I already have the right to pray, and being the slightly rebellious kind of guy that I am, I don't like some government office telling me when and where I can pray. It's a privilege, and it's private. I guess go back to that whole thing about the separation of church and state. See a long time ago people who necessarily didn't want to pray were forced to, and that's not right either. Wait, hey! I'll see you later on okay? Dwayne what page did she say we had to read... Craig, I think I'm in love. Dwayne man you're always in love. But look at her, she's gorgeous. I think you're suffering from a terminal case of puberty. Nobody should be that good looking. Then talk to her. You don't think I will. I can tell by the way you said that, you don't think I've got what it takes. Dwayne, you are a stud. Talk to the girl. Hi. How's it goin'? My name's Dwayne. I think names are very important. I like your name, it's cute. My parents are rich. Listen Wayne. With a D, Dwayne. Whatever, I don't wanna be bothered, okay? I have no intention of invading your personal space, and I would just like the same courtesy in return. Man. Got kinda cold in here. That was vicious. Don't worry about it. Maybe your parents will buy her a personality for Christmas. Craig do I smell bad or something? Yes, you do, but that's not important. She's not worth it. "My parents are rich," where'd you come up with that one? I was desperate. You ever get tired of it? Being a leader? Being together, secure? Mature. Sure I get tired of it. Yeah but that's your job. People are supposed to be bored with their jobs. I'm bored with my life. Come on what are you smiling about? I'm serious, I'm bored. Craig, you are one of the most active guys I know. You're head of the youth group, captain of the baseball team, every girl in the whole campus... Yeah I know, I'm a great kind of guy. I just don't know why I do it sometimes. Why do you do it? I don't know. I spend more time trying to make good on everybody else's expectations of me, and that's fine. I don't mind being living proof that all Christians aren't duds. It's just that, I want more. I feel like I'm treading water, like I'm wasting my time. I want something big to break wide open. I want God to give me an opportunity and I want it now. Well? Well what? Well aren't you going to say anything? Oh like words of wisdom? Isn't that your job? You're not gonna like it. Come on. I'm together, secure and mature, I can handle it. Craig, when he's ready, in his time, he'll make you who he wants you to be, you know that. Come on. Don't you have any how to books or something? Adults always give you a book when they don't know the answers. You already have one. You ace me every time. It's what I'm here for. - Hey! - Great! Didn't know high school was a contact sport. Yeah I was going to get a little golf cart to putter around in between classes, make sure I get there on time. But, I don't golf, and I guess I'd look pretty silly in green and yellow checkered pants. Hey, there's a new thing they got out now, it's really neat. It's called courtesy. Unbelievable. Hey babe, how's it goin'? Just fine Mr. Johnson. What's new with you? Well I got a new chest hair today. Pretty excited about that, that makes three. Craig, you are too much. Carrie around? Yeah, she's in the file room. Go on back. Craig. Carrie. What's goin' on? Not much. Was wondering if you could do me a favor. I'm broke. No that's not what I meant. Was wondering if you could dig up a file for me on a girl named Darby Peters? She just transferred from Lake Forest and I wanted to know... And you wanted to know all about her and if she has a boyfriend and where she lives. Actually I have no interest in dating this girl. I'm just curious. Besides it wouldn't say anything in her file about a boyfriend would it? Well she doesn't seem to be your type anyway. Why not? The girls got an attitude problem. She's too good, nobody can touch her. I just wanna find out what the deal is on this girl, I can't figure her out. Besides, if you don't dig the file up for me, gonna tell everyone you're in love with Pee-wee Herman. You wouldn't. In a heartbeat baby, you'd be ostracized forever. Just learned that word today, ostracized. You like it? Now don't you dare tell anybody I did this. No problem, be our little secret. Thanks Carrie, later. Later. Oh and, give Pee-wee my love. So what do you think, it's gonna work for the youth festival? Will you stop? You're making me sick, I just ate lunch. Hey, was I that bad? Listen you guys go ahead to the truck okay? I'll be there in a second. Well hello Miss Peters. How are you? Just fine of course, I can tell by your tone of voice. You know it didn't surprise me one bit that you didn't win anything but the talent part in the Junior Miss Pageant. From what I understand personality's very important in the judging, and how much personality does it take to play a piano? How do you know that? And you know for the life of me, I can't figure out how you got elected to the student government last year. One would think that you'd have to make speeches, and talk to people, and from what I've seen your vocabulary's about as sorry as your attitude. Call me nit picky, call me old fashioned, call me... An idiot? Unbelievable. Wait, see if he's all right. See if he's all right. He okay? Oh man. Stevie boy, we better get you to the hospital. My head. Doesn't look good Stevie boy. But you sound great, you are really really sound great. I mean you don't look bad, you just don't look real good. Very funny Dwayne. I hope I don't get one of those old doctors. I can never understand what they say. Sorry, I'm late, my name is Dr. Magoo. I got caught in traffic. I said to the guy I said, "Get out of the way you roadhog!" But he wouldn't move. Let's take a look here. Oh well the nose looks just fine. I'm afraid we're gonna have to remove the ugly human being behind the nose. If you know what I mean. May I help you? Could you tell me where the gift shop is? I can give you a hint. It's not on this floor. Nice smile. I just wanna find out what the deal is on this girl. I can't figure her out. You really like that girl Craig? I don't even think she's still going here. I mean I never see her in class. She hasn't been around for at least a week. I know she's not been around 'cause. Craig's breaking out in a rash. You know somehow I think I'm a little outnumbered here. Hey sugar, what are you doing tonight? Hey whoa, wait a minute, you too good for me? Please leave me alone. Oh really, come on a night with you? I'd rather die anyway, it'd be more fun. Get lost! Hey! Darby? Darby? Please go away. Whoever you are please just leave. My name's Craig, I'm in your English class. Tall goofy looking guy, nice smile. No! I don't need anybody. Look, why don't you just quit it with the attitude all right? I'm not buying it. You've got a friend whether you want one or not. What are you so afraid of. I'm not afraid! I'm dying. I have cancer. I won't let myself be scared by it. I refuse. Sometimes, when the pain gets really bad, I talk to it. I turn it into a character, and I get mad at it. It's sounds pretty stupid doesn't it? Sounds like good strategy to me. I have no idea how that must feel. No one's ever asked me what it felt like. Although I can see it in their eyes. Especially my mom. It's like she wants me to share it with her. Somehow make the pain go away. I guess I would be curious too if it wasn't me. What does it feel like to know that you're dying? To live with that everyday. If you wanna talk about that I can understand. No. I've just never talked about it with anyone before. At first I wrote a lot. See that's what I wanted to be, more than anything. A writer. I would just write about anything. Were you scared. Very. But more than anything, I'm afraid of just, wasting away. That's why you still go to school. I don't wanna just curl up and die. What about your old school? If I was at my old school, it would just be sad all the time. I love my friends, and I miss them a lot. But I can't think of the fact that I am never gonna see them again and expect to keep my sanity. I gotta stay chipper. Glad I caught up to you.

Stop it, stop being so cute. Must've lost my head. Oh, come here baby! Come here dog, come here! Hey. Come here. How are you, how are you? Dog, I want you to meet Craig. You'll like Craig, you look a lot a like. I'm hurt, deep. This dog is just too cute. Hey boy. He's my best friend. Aren't you baby? Do you wanna go in the house? Is that what you want? Is that what you want, come on. Here you go. And hold all of my calls. Best friends huh? Best friends. Boy. You know I was kinda curious about something, I was wondering if you could help me with it. Okay. Well we've been seeing each other for a few weeks now, and it's been dandy. In fact I mean I would go so far as saying that you're pretty good company. For a girl. Oh I'm flattered. Well I know we call ourselves friends. Not best friends, I wouldn't want to horn in on Dog's territory but, well I was wondering if the next time we got together, we could call it a date? A date? Yeah, or something like that. And I should warn you if you say no, I will jump in front of a bus. Oh really? Yeah, it won't be moving but I will jump in front of one. We could call tonight a date. I mean I wouldn't mind. Really? That'd be great. You know I usually make it a habit never to shake hands on the first date, but with you I'll make an exception. ♪ Passing the time with you ♪ ♪ I cherish each moment together ♪ ♪ For time's passing swiftly now ♪ ♪ I know I can't hold you forever ♪ ♪ This should be the time for us ♪ ♪ To share our dreams and plans ♪ ♪ But every hope we've ever had ♪ ♪ Is slipping through our hands ♪ ♪ And I cry ♪ ♪ As you pass me by ♪ Do you wanna go to church with me on Sunday?

Yeah I know. How's everything going with the youth festival? You tell me, you're in charge of it. None of us can come up with anything. I'll get on it okay? Craig? Don't you think you're getting a little serious with this girl? People are starting to wonder. Yeah well, you tell the people that they can mind their own business. I have to make a telephone call, excuse me. Yeah hi Mrs. Peters, yes it's Craig. Fine, thank you. Well I noticed that Darby wasn't in school today, I was just calling to, you know, see if everything was all right. Oh. Well how long has it been? Mm hmm. How bad are they? I see. Will you tell her that I'll be over as soon as school lets out? Okay thanks, I'll see you in a little bit. Okay, bye bye. Hi Craig, come on in. How's she doing? She's in quite a bit of pain. How are you? I'm doing my best. Darby? Honey Craig is here, can he come in? Why don't you go on in, I'll be in here if you need me. Darby? It hurts. I know. I know, I'm here. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff... They comfort me. I love you. I'm not bored anymore. Congratulations. God gave you your great opportunity? Well I haven't thoguht of it exactly like that, but he gave me an opportunity all right. And? Well. Ah, I see, it's a girl. Who told you that? Dwayne? Nobody had to tell me. I can see it in your eyes and besides, I've seen that look a lot. Sick isn't it? I don't know, why do you say that? Look, I have been smitten before, but this is different. This girl has everything. And she's pretty? Oh yeah. She's a writer. She showed me some of her stuff, it's really good. Very honest, very vulnerable. I mean I don't understand it, but when somebody puts their heart into words, and they trust you with it, you can't help but love that person. She sounds perfect. What's the problem? She's not a Christian, and I've tried talking to her about it, and I've asked her to come to church but she's so distant. It's like she has God on hold, and she doesn't have time for that. What do you mean? She knows all she needs to know and now she just needs to make a decision. You mean you want her to make a decision? Yes I want her to make a decision. Well you can't make that happen Craig. That's her choice. Yeah but there's a life at stake here. I'm not denying that. I'm simply saying that you don't have control over that. You just have to trust God and... And wait. Well I don't have time for that right now. Craig you really don't have a choice. See, he has a unique sense of timing and... Yeah well this time it's a little off. I'm playing beat the clock here and I don't think I'm winning. You've been talking to her a lot lately about God and heaven and hell haven't you? Yes I have. Well, that's what we're concerned about. I don't know whether she's shown it around you or not but that's had an effect on her. Her mother and I just don't want her to have any more worries and concerns than she already has. Just don't think she ought to be dealing with that sort of thing right now. Well when do you think she should deal with it? Craig. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but you're both doing a lot of wonderful things for her. I mean you bought her a car, and she could ask for just about anything and you'd give it to her, and that's great. But the one thing she needs right now you don't want her to have. Hi. Hi honey, where have you been? Craig's been waiting for you awhile. Chris asked me out to lunch, and it took longer than we thought. How is Chris? He's fine. Did you tell him we said hello? No Mom I didn't. Maybe you should ask him over for dinner sometime. Just because you're not dating doesn't mean he's not welcome here. That goes for all your friends. I think it would be good for you to see them again. Can you bother please stop it! It's okay honey, we're not angry. You wanna talk about it? I don't like being interrogated. Well I think they were only concerned. So this Chris guy, you used to date him? I'm not interrogating you I'm just curious. Why? Because I care that's why. Well what are you curious about? Are you wondering if he tried to kiss me? And if he did try to kiss me did the old feelings come back? The memories, the good old days. Come on. What is that? You know how I feel about you. I think it's pretty sorry that you have to talk to me like that. You know I don't know what it is you're looking for, but I hope you find it soon, because you're running out of time. I'm sorry that came out wrong. Look I just care that's all. Nothing happened. Seeing Chris just reminded me of my old friends. He said that they're angry, and that I hurt them. I just feel guilty. Well, you know God says... I am not a little Sunday school girl! You know I have a mind of my own. Yeah well who do you think gave it to you? Will you stop pushing me? Let me ask you a question. - Stop preaching to me! - Do you believe in God? It's a simple question, do you believe in God? - Yes, yes, all right. - Yes, you believe in God. Then why don't you trust him? What are you so afraid of. This is forever we're talking about here. Think about how long forever is. I don't wanna just have you as a memory for eternity. When I get to heaven I want you to show me around. Give him your life Darby. Give him my life? He is taking it! Little by little everyday Craig! He died for you, he wants you to live with him forever. Well I don't think I have what it takes. So why don't you just forget about me and go out with your little teeny bopper church school friends. I'm really sorry. You should not be surprised at my saying you must be born again. The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the spirit. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stand condemned already, because he has believed in the name of God's one and only son. Craig, telephone call for you. Tell 'em I'm not home. It's Darby. Darby? Hi Craig. I know the weather is really terrible outside, but do you think you could just come over for a little bit? I really need to talk to you. Listen Darby, I'm really sorry. Please, just come over. Okay? All right I'll be right over. Do you wanna go for a walk? Gee I don't know Darby. Looks like we might be getting a little rain. Come on, I don't care. Let's go. All right. This is adorable, it really is, it's very neat, but what's this all about. Jesus. Clarify. You were right. All the time you were right. I finally found out what I was so afraid of. See I always thought I could make it on my own, but deep inside I knew I wasn't strong enough. I was too proud to meet God. Anyway, I've been reading the Bible since we had our fight. And I also started to talk to God, and the more I talked to him, the closer I felt to him. And? He's real. He's real and I know it! Oh it's so hard to explain. He's here, and I'm safe, and I'm not afraid to meet him anymore. I started to get curious that day when you came over and I was having one of my spells, and you read the Bible to me when I was resting. It soothed me. Just any book wouldn't have done that. There was something in what you were reading that made me feel better. I mean, the pain didn't go away. It just made it more bearable somehow. I just seemed to relax after that. Yeah but if you were so afraid of it, what made you brave enough to read it? I guess I was afraid that it was true, and that I was missing out. You know what? I think I'd like to sing. Great, go ahead. I'd love to hear you sing. No, I mean something special. Like maybe something at that youth festival thing you were telling me about. I mean if there was... That would be great! We're still looking for something for our group to do. I was also wondering if we could talk to that pastor friend of yours. Let's go talk to him right now. I'll race you. How's she doing? She's a little nervous. I'm nervous for her. She's got a headache. What's wrong? Nothing. She said she has a surprise for me and it's driving me crazy. Oh. Good job guys. Good job, they've been practicing huh? Well we hope you've been having a great time at the youth festival, we've been hearing some fantastic talent. Now we've got someone that's very, very special. I don't think you've all met her yet. She's going to be sharing a song that is very close to her heart. So help me welcome, Miss Darby Peters. I was supposed to sing a song called El Shaddai tonight, but the other night I was laying in bed and I couldn't sleep because like usual I had this guy on my mind. Next to the Lord, he's my best friend. And if it weren't for him I wouldn't be here tonight. He never gave up trying to convince me that Jesus loves me. All of us. Anyway, I couldn't sleep so I went downstairs, and I wrote this song. I couldn't think of a better time to sing it.

I love you. Craig. Craig. Wake up. What? What time is it? It's a little after 3:00. What's wrong? Darby's having a really bad night, and her mom wants you to come over to the hospital and be with her. How's she doing? Has she woken up? - She's resting now. - What did the doctor say? It's all right. He said that they were changing focus, and that they just wanted to try to make her as comfortable as possible. What do you mean? He said we should stay. What are you thinking? That first day... We were having supper. She said she'd been having bad headaches all day at school. So I fixed spaghetti for supper. That's her favorite. Suddenly she jumped up from the table, and she got sick before she could even get out of the dining room. Don grabbed her and carried her out to the car. She was screaming. It hurt so bad to hear her scream like that and I couldn't help her. Wanna go for a walk? Get some coffee or something? Craig. Go home and get some rest. I'm all right. Compared to what, being hit by a truck? Go on get some rest. For me. I'm not going. Where are your parents? They went to get some breakfast. They got some sleep. Nothing's gonna happen. I feel strong today. Really. I'll even give you a wake up call. I won't need one. Don't be such a pouty face. Unbelievable. Why? Why? Why? Why? Let's get some coffee. Are you okay Craig? Yeah I'm fine thanks. We'll be right back. There's so much I want you to know. So much I wanna share with you. And I'm never gonna get the chance. Things I am just now discovering and I want you to be there. Because I love you. God. You gave her to me. She's a gift. And now you wanna take her back? And I'm angry. And I'm hurt. And I wanna understand. I wanna understand. She's gonna be in heaven. I know that. No more pain. No more tears. What about me? I don't wanna be left alone. Craig. Yeah. I must've fallen asleep reading. Come here. I'm here. Closer. Closer. I love you. I love you. Ah, Mr. Peters, come on in. Hi Craig, no I can't come in. Dorothy's waiting in the care. We're gonna take a little trip up north. Get away for a couple weeks. That sounds like a good idea. I wanted to bring a couple things over to you. I get to keep Dog? Darby insisted on it. Come here boy. She, she also wanted you to have this. What is it? Well I suppose you could call it her memoirs. She said she wanted you to read it first before anyone else, then you can do what you want to with it. Well thanks. By the way, Darby wanted us to at least give church a try. In fact she insisted on it. So, maybe when we get back, huh? Well you're welcome to go with me anytime. Well I better get going before Dorothy starts blowing the horn. You take care of Dog. Drive carefully, and thanks. Dearest Craig, welcome to the final edition of Point of View. Sound familiar? Those are the first words I remember you saying. I never heard anyone so positive. So sure of their convictions. Now it's my turn. I hope you like this journal, you're in it a lot. Oh Craig, there's so much I wanna say to you. Like, how cute you were when you and the mosquitoes asked me out for that first date, or when even rocky road ice cream couldn't hide the sparkle in your eyes. Oh I love your eyes. I love you. I know you must be feeling pretty lonesome right now. Dealing with confusion. Your anger, your tears, but remember Craig, you helped me to see the importance of accepting God's will, regardless of the price. If it wasn't for my cancer I never would've changed schools, which means I wouldn't have met you, and I might not've met Jesus. Thank you for eternity. And for showing me that perfect love casts out fear. I give you my thoughts, my dreams, my laughter, my tears, my heart. In Christ's love, Darby.
