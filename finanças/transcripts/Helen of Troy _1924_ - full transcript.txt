"Adonis, god of spring, awaken, so that life can bloom once more." "I place a myrtle crown upon the holy dove of Aphrodite. May she find the most beautiful woman in Greece, who with her naked beauty shall awaken Adonis." In Sparta, in the palace of Menelaus, King of the Greeks, Helen, the wife of the king, sat playing the harp with her companions. "The holy dove of Aphrodite brings you the crown of myrtle. Oh, Queen! You are the chosen one for the festival of Adonis." But Queen Helen was faithful to her husband, and feared the temptations of Aphrodite. "Menelaus, spare me the shame of exposing my nakedness to the eyes of strangers." "You shall be the envy of the whole world. You shall go to Cythera!" "Through Agamemnon, all of Greece shall pay homage to you." Priam, King of Troy, sought the protection of the gods as well. "Athena, our protector! Spring returns. Bring a year of peace to the sacred city of Troy." "Priam, my King! The oracle's answer is favourable!" "Light the bonfires! Let the entire population come at once and, as a token of gratitude, celebrate the festival of spring!" And while Troy rejoiced in the festivities... ...on the hills above Troy, the sounds of a shepherd's flute also praised the spring. "Agelaus, my good father, why do you bring me this wreath?" "My Paris, why do you always seek solitude? Accompany me to the festival in Troy." Agelaus had raised Paris, the youngest son of Priam, although he was supposed to have sacrificed him to the gods to prevent calamity from befalling Troy. "Forgive me, oh gods! Paris does not know that as son of a king, he is entitled to glory and power. Please help him receive what is rightfully his." In the twilight of that spring day, Paris fell asleep on Mount Ida. "I, Hermes, messenger of the gods, say to you: Give this golden apple to the most beautiful of the three goddesses who appears to you." "I am Hera, goddess among goddesses. Choose me, and I will make you the richest and most powerful man on earth." "Give the apple to me, Athena, goddess of wisdom, and eternal glory shall be yours." "I, Aphrodite, goddess of love, will give you the love of the most beautiful woman on earth, and make you the happiest man alive." "I choose you, Aphrodite! You are the most beautiful of the goddesses." "Follow my white dove, and it shall guide you safely across the sea." The break of day. "Let us go to Troy, to the festival of spring. There I will sacrifice to Aphrodite the best and strongest of my bulls." King Menelaus received a warning from the gods. Hear what the oracle of Delphi has to say: If you lose Queen Helen to another man, all of Greece will be forced to fight for her for many years." THE ABDUCTION OF HELEN End of Act One THE ABDUCTION OF HELEN Act Two The festival of spring in Troy. Furious that Paris favoured Aphrodite, Hera took revenge on Troy by sending a cyclone. "Priam! Lord and shepherd over the people!" "The goddess Hera seems to take grave offense at some unknown iniquity. Her statue lies in pieces, shattered by her fury." "Send me, your son Hector, to Greece, to the sanctuary of Hera. With our finest cattle as an offering, I hope to appease her wrath." "I, Aesacus, warn you, Priam! Woe be to you should one of your sons sail for Greece." "And so I ask the men of my people: Who dares sail beyond the sea?" "Prepare the sacrificial ship!" In the dark of night, Helen sought council from the oracle. "You have the power to invoke the dark future. Tell me if I should follow the call and go to Cythera." "Your star shall tell you your fate." Queen Hecuba, wife of Priam, wrapped holy bands around the head of the Trojan envoy. "Adorn the cattle for the sacrificial ship with the garlands of holy Troy!" Angered by the choice of envoy, Athena revoked her protection over the city and hurled lightning upon her statue. "Hurry! Call for the seer Aesacus!" "Ask not, King! Seeing is knowing, and knowing is suffering!" "The ship bears doom! In your death you shall see the downfall of Troy!" "Hector, may the sacrificial ship placate the guardian goddess of Troy!" Wearing the divine girdle of Aphrodite, which she received from the priests, Helen made her way to the feast of Adonis on Cythera. "The princes of Greece are gathered to honour Aphrodite with a competition. Take this wreath and consecrate it at the altar of Adonis, so that it may be awarded to the winner of the chariot race at dawn." Helen's entry into the arena of Cythera. Menelaus prepared for the chariot race. Achilles, the most noble of the Greek heroes. "Thersites, you are cunning. Since Helen will bestow the wreath, I must not lose to Achilles in the race!" "I will prevent proud Achilles from partaking in the race." "Since when does Achilles fight for women's wreaths?" "Unharness the horses, Patroclus!" "I will not compete!" Inflamed by Helen's beauty, Achilles desired to receive the victory wreath from her hands. "Hail Menelaus!" "Quickly, get the horses! They are one round ahead of us!" "Helen!" "Hail! Hail! Achilles is passing Menelaus!" "Hail! Hail! Achilles has caught up in the second round!" The last round. "I, Achilles, have won!" "Shall I throw you into the dust at Helen's feet, Menelaus?" "Stand together, princes of Greece! The blood of the sacrificial animal has stained the altar. The gods warn of blood." "Do not fight over Helen! Swear that we will defend her together, against anyone who dares do her the slightest harm." THE ABDUCTION OF HELEN End of Act Two THE ABDUCTION OF HELEN Act Three On the sacrificial ship, Paris fought against the raging sea. "We must turn back! The ship can no longer withstand the raging storm." "Let me take the rudder! There is no turning back!" After her ritual bath, Helen stepped out of the bath and put the sacred girdle back on. "Should he be alive through whom you have awaked my yearning, Aphrodite, then let him overcome all perils to reach me!" "Your prayer has calmed the sea, Paris! We will follow you wherever you go." "I fear that the oracle's prophecy is starting to come true. Let us flee and return home!" "Too late. Already the victor approaches to take me to the boat." With melancholy in his heart, Achilles watched Helen as she left in the High Priest's boat for the Temple of Adonis. "Helen, by the will of the goddess Aphrodite, today you are the bride of her divine son Adonis." In the marble image of the god of spring, Helen recognized the face of her beloved from her dream. "I have reached my destination! Hurry now, to the island." "Hear my love, Adonis, I am yours! Spring waits to be reawakened by our kiss." "Oh, you have awakened, eternal creator of spring!" "I am not who you hold me to be. I am only a simple shepherd guided by Aphrodite to the fairest of the fair." The morning after the night of love. The lovers awake in dishonour, though not of their own fault. "Flee, the High Priest approaches! The curse of all of Greece shall be upon me, for you must know: I am Helen, Queen of Sparta." "I love you and cannot take another breath without you. Come with me!" "We are lost. The sail is useless!" "Take the sacred shroud of Aphrodite for a sail. Hurry!" "Cursed are you, Helen, you are unworthy to be queen! Cursed by Aphrodite, whose sanctity you defiled!" "Cursed are you, you wicked Trojan raider. The Greeks will tear apart your villainous band. A curse upon Troy!" Meanwhile, the princes of Greece dined until the break of dawn, listening to the singer's songs of heroic deeds. "Achilles, are you dreaming of the victory wreath that Helen consecrated for you at the Adonis statue? Take this one!" "Wash your disgraceful mouth with wine before you dare speak the name of Helen!" "What do you care about my wife?" "Do you still have a right to Helen? You, who out of arrogance exposed your wife to the eyes of others?" "Listen, Helen has been abducted!" "Greeks, remember your oath! Now is the time to fight together for Helen!" "At the Temple of Adonis we found King Priam of Troy's sacrificial garland." "To Troy!" THE ABDUCTION OF HELEN End of Act Three THE ABDUCTION OF HELEN Act Four A mysterious plague raged across Troy. Children perished and no remedy could be found. "Have you still not seen the sacrificial ship?" "Enough of your wailing! I will place a new divinity over Troy and elevate it over all other gods." Not knowing which of the gods he should choose, Priam waited for a sign. "A new calamity, my Lord and King! The lions have attacked your herds. They have killed two of my companions." "We found this wreckage of the sacrificial ship in the sea." "Then you must be dead, Paris, you solace of my old age!" "Then hear, oh King, the terrible secret." "Fear of punishment kept me from speaking. Only now did Paris die. Against your will, I could not kill your son at the time!" "I raised him in secret and loved him. He was as beautiful as a god." "Aphrodite, goddess born of the sea foam, cast this shroud through the sea and upon the shore to us." "Aphrodite, is this a sign you give to me?" "Then Aphrodite is the new guardian goddess of Troy. Call a lion hunt in her honour!" Shipwrecked and dashed about by the waves, only with great effort could Paris bring his lover to safety on the rocky shore. "Those are the walls of the sacred city of Troy, my home!" Preparations for the lion hunt. While Hector arms himself for the hunt, his mother Hecuba visits him. "Have them show you to the mountain altar, and there, sacrifice the blood of a lion for the soul of my dead child Paris, for whom I have shed more tears than this bowl can hold." Paris carried Helen into the hut of Agelaus. "I'm just a poor shepherd of these hills, who would conquer kingdoms for you, and yet has nothing but his love to offer!" "Split up the hunting party. Lions have been seen in the hills and in the valley!" "Give me the bowl for the sacrifice at the mountain altar!" "Aphrodite, give me strength, so that I may win a new kingdom for her who gave up a kingdom for me. I would rather lose her and die than know that she spends one day in distress and poverty." "Never was your hunt better, Hector. Look, here is your brother Paris!" "Now you too know the long held secret. You are Paris, son of King Priam, and this is your brother Hector." "Brother!" "Aphrodite, help!" "If you are looking for a sacrifice, take me!" "If you have called me here, Aphrodite, to save these two, then I will cease to be angry about my misstep." THE ABDUCTION OF HELEN End of Act Four THE ABDUCTION OF HELEN Act Five Troy celebrates the successful lion hunt. "Protected and accompanied by Helen, the envoy of Aphrodite, your sons Paris and Hector return, King Priam." "Kneel and kiss her robes! This woman has been granted wondrous powers!" "My Paris, my lost son who has now been found!" "Thanks to you, who has released me from the curse of the gods, today I enjoy the happiest day of my life!" "Woe to you, Priam! This woman will bring doom! Because of her, your sons will die, and because of her, Troy will be reduced to ashes." "Doomsayer, never have you spoken a word which brought me prosperity! Put him in shackles in the deepest dungeon!" A ship of the Greek fleet brought the commanders Agamemnon and Menelaus ashore to King Priam. "I, Menelaus, demand Helen, my wife, from you, King Priam!" "And l, Agamemnon, in the name of all Greeks, demand the release of the Queen of Sparta!" "Here begs an aged King, here beg his sons, and a grateful people: Remain with us, oh guardian goddess, and do not take from us your blessing, which you have bestowed upon Troy." "You once laughed at my distress, and drove me to do what I was afraid to do. Now I must stay where fate has brought me. Because, you see, I am the only hope these people have." "Then I seek protection at this altar. Troy is my new home." "Greece, so offended, will not rest until the flames shoot as high from Troy's walls as that arrow flew!" King Priam sought help from the gods. After the Greek delegation returned, a battle broke out on the shores near Troy. Hector led the way, in an attempt to fight off the Greek landing. Achilles challenged Hector to a duel. "Call Paris and Helen!" "Save Hector! Only divine intervention can bring victory to us!" "Aphrodite, do not let me do evil against my own people!" "It is not in my power to perform a miracle, oh Priam." "Who will fight with me for Helen?" "Victory! Paris has triumphed!" "I, Agamemnon, King of the Greeks, place Helen under this sword. We shall have our day of vengeance. Then she shall pay for her offense!" "I alone am called upon to judge over Helen. With this shield of mine, I will protect her from the sword of vengeance! For I still cannot believe that she has done any wrong." "You saved my life, my brother. Who gave this shepherd such courage?" With loving gratitude, Helen places the victory wreath upon Paris' head. "Now all my wishes have been fulfilled! I have gained glory, and a kingdom is at your feet, Helen!" "I will not return home until that wreath adorns my head, for it belongs to me alone!"
