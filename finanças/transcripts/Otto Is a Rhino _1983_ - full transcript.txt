Good morning, morning. Good morning, Topper. Good morning, auntie. Will my father come home today? 78 ... 79 ... 80. 81 ... 82. It won't last long now. Do you believe he's thinking of me anymore? Of course. You know he does. See for yourself how often he does. Would you send it to someone you don't like? No. Whom do you believe this is from? Don't forget school. No pranks, OK? We never do . Beer bottles in the big crates, soft drinks in the small. The beers to the right of the door, soft drinks to the left. Beer in the small bottles to the left of the soft drinks. He can take one more crate. Gives you strength, right Viggo? - Yes, dad. - Must be systematic. - Don't forget the garbage-bin. - Yeah, yeah dad. Come straight home from school. We have things to do. - Viggo, see to that Topper goes to school. - Yeah, yeah, Topper to school. What are you looking at, Erling? Go on! Sweep ...! - You ... uh ... Viggo? - Yes, Holm. I've been thinking. If we say that you were an elderly, a little mature woman, - - an elderly, sweet, a little mature woman, right? Yes, Holm, let's say that I'm an elderly, sweet, mature woman. Yes, really sweet and cute - Yes, really sweet and cute - - Like ... - Mrs. Flora? Yes, in fact ... a little bit like Mrs. Flora. Let's say there's something I like to ask about. What will you answer? What's your question? Dear Mrs. Flora, will you please marry me? Still not asked about that? It isn't easy ... heh? You know what? I believe she wants it in black and white. - Black and white? - Mr. Holm ... Did you say something, to me Mr. Holm? - What about a cup of nice coffee? - Yes, please, Mrs. Flora. She's a little bit nuts about coffee? If you ask me, she's wonderful. What's that noise? Det er ikke noget cirkus! Hi ...! We better hurry. "Coming home soon. Hope all is well. Greets, dad." He's always writing the same? And I should tell we have it superb here. Right, Viggo? - Won't you have milk ? - It's ok with the candies. How often have I told you to remove that old junk? - Many times, dad. - Not once, but 100 times. This is my personal pushchair, Mr. L?we. Oh ... OK. That young Topper's pushchair? I wasn't aware of that. - I thought so. - So why's it in front of my house? Why isn't it among the crocodiles and all that other junk? Get rid of it. Now!. Have you seen, Mr. Holm? - Get rid of that old shit. - Let go! What are you olaying, Mr. L?we? What? ... We're just playing dad, mom and children, Mrs. Flora. Stop this nonsense, Otto. Help me. Off to school, boys! Erling, what are you looking at? Go on scrub the floor! "Dad, mom and children" must be something for you being so young? Yes, makes me think of something ... something black and white, - - which I've wanted to tell you for a long time, Mrs. Flora. It's not that easy. What would you tell me, Mr. Holm? Would you be so sweet ... Would you be so sweet and see if there's more coffee? Your dad looks funny when he's angry. Isn't he ever happy? Yes, once when I bought him a big cigar. Then he pat me on my head. And I think he smiled to me. It's boring in this city. Nothing happens here. Viggo? Hi, Sille. Hi, Topper. Hi, Sille. I'm just out for a walk. - Have you seen Viggo og Sk?ve? - What "sk?ve"? - Our pushchair. - I haven't seen any "sk?ve". Look what I've found. - Viggo? - What's that pushchair doing here? This isn't a parking lot. Get out, punk! Don't forget your old school bag. Why did you let go of the pushchair? As of now I'm driving and you're in it. Right? Have a nice time? - What are you doing here? - I got a letter from my dad. I should read it to Viggo. Topper ... Topper ...! "School is closed for the summer." Come on, Viggo! Order saves time, time is money. - We're having holidays. - Things are to be done, my friend. What are you writing? Nothing. Only some letters. - May I have a look? - No, Sille, I'm writing so ugly. - You hurt your eyes. - Let me have a look, Topper. - You're nuts. - I thought it was nice. - What? - That. You are nuts, Topper. Viggo! Ingenious. This will improve sales. Let's see... Like that ... almost. We name the inn "The blue Catfish". Viggo can paint a nice sign, right? Yes, dad, a nice sign. Oh, I'm gonna be a millionair. Thanks, Bent. Take a beer from the crate. No, no. this one's for free ... Erling! Let's see what the sign shall look like. - Viggo, look! - Quiet! Look, I've found a magic pencil. Dad ... may I go and look at Topper's magic pencil? A magic pencil? You should rather paint the sign. Topper is a good at drawings ... as I've seen in the stairs. Otto, give the boys some time off. You can make the sign yourself. - Can't you write on it here? - It shall be drawn. My dad will get crazy. What if it doesn't go away? Everything you draw with this one disappears. Oh. You know what, Viggo? I wanna make a drawing of my dad. A big, strong sailor. I understand, Topper. It's more difficult to remember those you love the best? I know what! What is it, Topper? Is it a palm? Oh, yeah.. now I can see what it is. It's to have 3 of those? Nice. Watch the fun. - Do you want one too, Viggo? - Yes, please. Thanks. - Topper ... it's still there. - Then we have to wait longer. - But ... the wall bumps. - It often does. There's something else. ... It's blinking with the eye. God, how nice it is. It's smart, right? It's beautiful. What shall we name it? - What's your dad's name? - Otto. Otto! That's it, that's it's name. Otto ...! Hi, Otto. Good morning. Dear, Mrs. Flora. Won't you ... Oh, it's hungry. Think it likes a "hamburger"? Rye bread. We must have more rye bread. - I'm going downstairs for money. - I can do it. OK, but hurry. You're hungry, right Otto? - Whar are you gazing at? - But ... How busy you children are these days. I need money for 10 rye breads. You must be very hungry. - No, it's for Otto. - So, your father has become hungry. No ... Otto is a rhino. Then 10 rye breads must be needed. Christ, how children are lying these days. And Christ how sulky adults are. Here ... but don't make any pranks. - Nor Otto. - No, he's clever. 10 rye breads. 10 rye breads. 10 rye breads, please. Folmer! Folmer ...! -Yes, Musse. -That rascal makes fun of me. - I only wants 10 rye breads. - Who's having those? - Our rhino. - Get out ...! Never heard a kid lie like that! Do something, Folmer! Teasing people like that. Here one buys 1 rye bread each time! Get out, rascal! - Hi, Sille. Come and look at Otto. - Who's Otto? - Otto is a rhino. - You're nuts, Topper. No, come back. I'll get him out on the balcony. Okay. Kom s?, Otto. Come, Otto. Come on, Otto. Out to Sille. - He won't. - That's a pity. It's difficult to have a girl friend. - How clever you are, Mr. Holm. - A little, yes. That boy eats a lot of rye bread. - No, it's for Otto. - I thought your name was Viggo. - One could believe it's an elephant. - No, it's a rhino. - It's a rhino, Mrs. Flora. - Oh, well. Calm down, Otto. You'll get rye bread. Holy Mombasa! - How did it get here? - By itself. Mr. L?we will throw us out. - We're not allowed to have animals. - That's why it's a secret. He makes the whole house shake. The more hungry he is, the more noise he makes. We must get some food, then. Rye bread ... ... and hay, perhaps. I'll get that. Lots of hay. It's cute, Topper. It's the cutest rhino I've seen. -It's Mr. L?we. We must hide him. Where? The carpet, Topper. Morning ... Mr. Holm, the roof lamp doesn't fall off anymore. Mm ... how sweet he is! Kind of you to give him the plaid. It's also the first time we're keeping a rhino. That must be celebrated with a nice cup of coffee. See you, Mr. Holm. Viggo, we must buy rye bread. - It sounds like they're keeping a pig. - It's not a pig. Pigs snore like this: Arghh pyh. Arghh pyh. Or maybe like this: Arghhhh, arghhhh. But not like this. I don't care what it is. It's not allowed in this house. This is the worst. It must go! Rh... rh... rhin ... Zoo... Zoo... garden ... This is interesting. Is it a rhino from India, Sumatra or Africa? Well ... it has 3 horns. This is most exciting. And he's yellow. Yellow? ... Oh, well. What's your name? L?we ... L?-we ... (lion) Ah, you are a lion, that sells rhinos? You believe I'm trading animals? -You're a funny man, right? -I am not a funny man! Yes, it's about an animal. We don't want it here. - You're calling from? - My caf?. Uh ... and your name? "The Yellow Catfish". We won't have this yellow beast here. You say you're sitting at a caf? - - surrounded by blue and yellow animals? - Then I know what you shall do. - Glad to hear that. Stop drinking and go to bed. Then the animals disappears. If not, we can come and get you. What shall it be? Nothing. Nothing. Folmer! Folmer ...! - Yes, Musse. - Isn't he going to buy something? Yes. I won't let him out before he's bought something. Now what, boy? Let me have 10 rye breads. You're a real man, Folmer. This is the worst I've experienced. The vice landlord is playing. My son's talking about a magic pen. Og s? en n?sehorn p? 2. floor Everyone laugh at Otto, L?we. Try to relax, L?we. - What is it, Erling? - It's a big one with ears. Yellow. It'll pass. Must be something Topper made. I'm sure you're right, lion mother. It's Topper. Rhino ... magic pencil. Ingenious ...! We'd make a fortune if we got our hands on ... Erling, come. "The Blue Catfish" is into a new era. That pencil will be our luck. If I get hold on it, I can draw anything I like. I'll be a millionair! Where's the rhino? Topper ... can't we just draw food for Otto? You're a genius, Viggo. The pencil. - Get the pencil. - I won't do it ...! I won't do it. I won't do it. I'll do it myself. You stay here. Boys, can you get me a long pitch-fork? - You can go up and grab it. - Hold on ... What's going on here? Come now, Mr. L?we. Come now. According to ? 812 it's illegal throwing hay through the windows. The animal is hungry. He eats the furniture. What kind of animal? It it ... a horse? Help ... ! Make it go away! Do something! Grab the pencils! Go fo help. Do something! Help's coming. The police is here. No, not the police. Get me out of here. Rhino ... Nothing about those in my book. Good, then I'll carry on. - Hey! Is the animal registered? - I don't know. Yo should know. Ol?! ... Ol? ...! Ol?! ... Ol?, come! Things must be in order. We have to know how much the animal measures. Good morning, Mr. police chief. ... Good morning, little Viggo. So, where's the animal? - Do you have a measure? - Yes. Well, it should be possible. 30 ... 60 ... 30 ... 60 ... What the heck. My caps. No one knows I'm the police chief now. I have one, it's almost alike. 5 pencils, and 1 of them is a magic pencil. Now what? Can't we just say hocus-pocus? - Hocus pocus?! - They do that in the circus. This isn't a circus. This is science. This demands brains, consideration, order. We have to think. I have to think. You keep quiet. Ssshhh ... 1 ... 2 ... ... 3 ... 4 ... 5. - Is it ok? - It's fine. - Otto ...! - My uniform! We must end this animal story now. According to ? 312 ... ... wild animals must be kept in a cage. Is that understood? My ... my book. My small book. I've lots of books. It must end ...! I'm tired. Tired of it all. Crazy people, calling at crazy hours - - about crazy problems. Old ladies being robbed! Children being molested! Hay stacks in the streets! Violence of officials! Wild animals on 2 floor! I'm going nuts! That rhino must go. It must out ... now ...! Ingenious! I've drawn 5 elastics. If one of them becomes an elastic ... - Then we have the macic pencil. - Elastics, Mr. L?we? I didn't hear you come. And you've the rhino with you. I was wondering where you had gone. You see Mr. police officer, I hear so bad. I'm not police officer, I'm a police chief. Oh, but now it's time for coffee. That's a good idea. We need that now. How kind you are, Mr. Holm, inviting your friends. It's nice with so many sweet people and animals. Here are some good cookies. Hi, Sille. - Now you can look at Otto. - Has Mrs. Flora also a rhino? - Yes, we fell through the floor. - Topper ...! Topper? Topper? ... Viggo? Topper? ... Topper, Viggo? Uhu! Hi, auntie. - All well? - Yes. Unbelievable how nice one can have it. - Have the boys caused accidents? - No, no. I'll come down for a cup of coffee. That's nice. Perhaps they must be drawn more explicit. Otto, Mrs. Flora is tramping around so the lamps are falling down. Yes, lion mother ... The lamps are falling down? - Then we can't see anything. - Do something. I'm not invited! L?we will be angry. Please, could you tramp less? My lamps are falling down. Sorry, a big animal visits us. - Animal? ... Not the yellow one? - Come inside. Don't stumble in the hay. - Viggo, do you want some? - Yes, 2. - Watch out, Otto. sthe floor solid enough? Else it falls down into my inn. - That's never happened before. - Once must be the first time. - Can't the police do something? - No, here's calm and order. And here's neither. As of now I keep disorder, coffee and a rhino. You're all gone crazy! - Fire? ... One moment. Fire! Spot 1 000 liters waters into the flat. - We enjoy spouting. - I'm glad for that. It's up there! Spout lots of water up there. Can't see any smoke. But there's a lot of fire. Just spout water up there. Plenty water. I'm smelling good coffee. Come, let's check it out. No. no, not coffee. Water. Plenty of water! Not coffee. - It's here the coffee is? - Yes ... step inside. I'll put the water kettle on. Not coffee! No more fire men! Down, down, away, away. The floor! The roof! That's the strange guy. Isn't he a little bit crazy? A pig. What about the coffee? Lovely fresh coffee. Here I come. 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... and now! You're strong, Mr. Holm Oh, I have some force. - May I have a beer? - 2 jugs draught beer. - Give me some beers. - 2 draught beers. 2 skipper-beers, please. - Otto, you're gazing! - We're ruined ...! Nonsense, we've never had so many customers. Erling, let L?we help you to bring more beer. Mr. L?we, won't you become the good, old, bitter Mr. L?we again? - We must get more beer. - Ruined. L?wen gets beer ... Quiet, little friend. God, how brave you are, Folmer. More beer, Mr. L?we. More beer. More beer ... more beer. It's the end. We're ruined. - More beer, Mr. L?we. - Beer ... end. More beer ... Did you say more beer?! Yes ... no. It was your wife. I'll give them more beer! ... Ouch! But how? This one ... Go and tell them more beer is coming soon. He says, more beer is coming. - Viggo ... - Haven't you told her yet? What did you mean by: "Black on white"? - Have you seen Topper? - No. Is there more beer? - Erling, we need more beer. - Yeah, yeah, more beer. - More beer, Mr. L?we, more beer. - "More beer, more beer" - What do you think I'm doing? - Have no idea. Can you see what it looks like? Come, come, come. - A beer-crate. - Correct. - And what's this? - A pencil. - They're all shouting for beer. - This is a magic pencil. This is beer, this is beer. Ingenious ...! Oh, beer, beer, beer. Off you go. Get glasses, jars, cascs, tubs. Move in with me, sweet Mrs. Flora. God, I never thought you would ask. I never thought you would like to know. We'll surely need a strong cup of coffee. More glasses! More bottles! We're soon out of glasses. - Can't we take a break? - A break ...?! - Like this. Break! More glasses! More bottles. Tubs! Bath tubs! Now wedon't need more. Where do we get all the beer from? From the wall ... well, the pencil. More glasses, we need more glasses. - Mom, have you seen Topper? - No. Can't you tell dad we need no more beer. Erling ...! Glasses ...! Bottles ...! Help me! This is the worst I've ever been going through through. - Give it to me. - What, Viggo? Give it to me. Give it to me ... the pencil. Help! Help your old dad, Viggo. - On certain conditions. - Conditions, Viggo? - Yes, the beer must be for free. - For how long? This evening? - No, for a month. - Free for a whole month?! And you will treat me and Topper decently. - For how long, Viggo? - Forever. You shall be happier and not only think of money. Money's important. Without it's not so comfy. Viggo! Oh ... Okay, Viggo, not so much about money. Okay, that's a deal. Ingenious. - Have you seen Topper? - Topper? No. - Haven't you seen Topper, either? - No. Have you seen a small boy with bristly hair? Topper! - Topper! - Viggo! I wasn't in party mood today. Look. Shall we go for a walk? Otto! No one has put you to bed? Are you sleepy, Otto? Come, Otto, to bed. Who are you? What do you want? - Topper! - Dad! Hi, Topper. Perhaps you know this boy? Get moving! We haven't got all day. Speed it up down there. It's a fine parrot, right Topper? We can swap. You could have the parrot here at home. I know a chief on a pacific island. Once we were drinking palm wine, he says: Get me a yellow rhino, and I will give you 1 or 3 of my wives. - What do you think? - I don't know. Isn't it best for Otto to join other rhinos? We will love that animal. Okay? I've something to do. We don't have all day. Why's the rhino saying so? Because it wants to leave for warm countries, right Topper? All onboard. Hi, Topper. Topper ... Didn't Topper say anything before he left? - He's not coming to wave goodbye? - I don't think so. - All onboard! - One moment, captain. - Is it because I'm leaving today? - No, not quite. Would he like me stay home ... and settle down? No ...! Do you believe Topper would like to come with me? All onboard! We're leaving. You don't sail at all before I'm back! Topper, we're sailing. Topper ... what I wanted ... What I thought was ... I wanted to ask ... Will you come with me? - Bye, Topper ...! - Have a nice time. I'll miss the yellow rhino. Ingenious! We name the inn "The Yellow Rhino". And we can sell beer for almost nothing. Topper! Topper ...! Viggo ...! Viggo ... here!
