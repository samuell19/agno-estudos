Cookee. Wake up, Cookee. How are you, Freddy? -When did you get here? -At four in the morning. The door was open, I came in and slept. This junkie will get us robbed someday. What? What are you wearing? Why have you come here? Tell me honestly. What have you done, this time? Read it. On the wedding night, groom runs away with the bride's jewelry. Are you insane? Where is the jewelry? I sold it for two lakhs. And you've come here with all the money? No. -I lost it all in a gamble. -You lost two lakhs in gambling! I could've earned eight lakhs if I were the winner. With two lakhs, I would've bought the jewelry back. I would've planned my honeymoon with another two lakhs. And I would've started my business with the rest of the money. But I had to borrow 300 rupees to get on a bus to Karachi. You! Freddy. Freddy, get out. Freddy. That's not fair. You had set an alarm. Get lost. Are you this dog's friend? His name is Freddy. But he behaves like a dog. Get lost. A man dies under custody due SHO Chaudhry's torture. Inquiry ordered. After committing fraud and minting millions, a man called Khan, aka Doctor, has been released on bail after six months. His fans celebrate. On the wedding night, the groom runs away with the bride's jewelry. The bride gets a nervous breakdown. You dog! So... what have you decided? What are you going to tell your wife? I don't know. Better decide before Hyderabad is filled with "most wanted" posters of you. And before the police raids my place. Police? Freddy, I am scared. We'll talk after I return from office. I'm getting late. And please don't venture outside. -Keep an eye on him. -Sure. -Freddy. -Quiet. Me too? Baby, I'll give you a super power. In a while. Can't you keep quiet, for once? No. Baby, here's your super power. Everyone wears it. Shut up! Help! How dare you touch me? I won't spare you. -Leave me. -I'm not going to spare you. Why isn't the car starting? I won't spare you! You were trying to kidnap me, you dog! I wont spare you. Damn! I asked you to wear it, but you didn't listen to me. Shall I come along? I've been asked to come all alone. You stay right here. -Welcome, Mr. Siddiqui. -Sir. -Take a seat. -Yes, sir. -Sorry to keep you waiting. -That's alright. How can I help you? I'm here to help you, instead. If only I can get the contract for building the new bridges. Fresh currency smells really good! This is Mr. Jamal. Sir, will I have to pay him as well? No. You don't have to pay him anything. In fact, he's going to give you something. A beating! Those who bribe people and those who accept it are both lawbreakers. Since the elections are near, hope you aren't doing this for publicity. Those who don't do anything need publicity, my boy. All my life, I've served others. And I've never lost in the elections. When did you get here? What? Listen! No. You cannot force me. This is totally wrong! What! Have you gone mad? -Don't do this, Farah. You'll be hurt. -No... -You'll die, Farah. -No, leave me. -Farah, don't do it. You'll get hurt. -No. Leave me. What's the time? Sorry, I don't have any change. Do I look like a beggar to you? No. Actually, I was... -What... -Stay right here! -Who the hell is he? -I won't spare you! Wait! You can't escape. -Wait, you scoundrel! -Go away. -Wait, you idiot! -Bye. Stop, I say! -You just ran off with the jewelry? -Yes. Just the jewelry. There was only enough time to take off her jewelry. -Freddy, why are you back early? -Early? -It's 8 p.m. -Usually, he returns after 11 p.m. Freddy? Freddy? Hey, what's up? A rough day with your boss? How did this happen? If I were to call the police, you'd be behind bars. You pervert! If you were so desperate, you should've found yourself a girlfriend. You must not randomly prey on innocent girls. She is inconsolable. Poor thing! Farah, don't cry. Say sorry to her and address her as your sister. Go ahead, address her as your sister! -Listen, you pervert. -What! She tried to seduce me in the kitchen. To hell with your job! I don't want it. What! You quit your job? -How dare you hit me? -Freddy! You idiot! -How dare you hit me? -Leave me. -Why are you hitting him? -Help! Stop! Let's discuss this! How are we going to survive? By selling ourselves? You won't be sold even for free. I don't care if we are in a public place. I'll beat you up, right here. Please calm down. Why are you messing with him? I'm not messing with him. When he lost his job, I didn't hit him. Now that I've lost mine, why does he care? I obviously care because we are dependent on his salary. How are we going to pay the bills? You tell me. All that we eat and rent! Who's going to pay for that? This parasite is also with us now. Teeli, don't call me a parasite. Check out his ego, man. You are a parasite. Sit down. Stay right there! I'm helpless. What is all this? Everything is alright, baby. Don't stress yourself. But... tell me, what is wrong with me? Everything is just fine. You are thinking too much. Please tell me! You are a coward. You get scared for silly reasons. They don't have change. Don't you dare talk about change! Calm down! -I gave them some change. -Don't say the word "change". I will kill you! Cut it out, man. Have you lost it? A girl called me "uncle" once. But, I didn't mind. Baby, he is coming here. He is coming towards us, baby. Do something! We will get beaten up today. If you want a drink, get one for yourself. -Go! -Don't touch him. -He is my friend. -Shut up, don't try to be macho. Are you the macho one here? I'll show you who the man is! Oh, no! -I'm not going to spare you! -Stop! Stop! Run! Run! Be careful! Run! Why did you hit the one I was fighting with? -Stop it, everyone! -Let me go! Aren't you supposed to blow the siren before arriving? Oh, no! Run! Run! -Hey! Hello. Come here. -Get inside. -Shut the door. -Thank you. You guys fought for me. Thank you so much! No need to thank us. Let's just go and have a cup of tea at your place. Sure. Let's go. Want some more tea? Boss, what do you do? I used to be a small time smuggler. Items such as mobile, laptops and perfumes. Then, I got bored. I wasn't enjoying it. Baby, they are strangers. Don't tell them your secrets. One should do something that he enjoys-- Baby, don't trust them. I told you to shut up! Do you have to interrupt? Women! They can't keep their mouth shut. -Go to hell. -Shut your mouth or I'm going to kill you. You never listen to me! I'll go to my mother's. This woman! Which woman, sir? Boss, who are you talking to? You guys must be feeling weird. -Yes. -Her name is Pari. She is my girlfriend. Only I can see her. Don't get scared, guys. Pari is very beautiful. Look, that's her picture. She is hot, boss. Boss, I think you are mentally disturbed. You should see a doctor. I'll slap you! You think I'm a result of his disturbed mind? Pari! How dare he! Throw him out of our house. Dog! She is getting angry at you because you asked me to see a doctor. She is very emotional. They came for a cup of tea, and now they are stuck here. I already consulted a doctor. He had given me some medication. Pari had vanished and I got bored. So, I stopped taking my medication. I'm in love with her. Is your condition contagious? Cookee! Are all of you jobless? Obviously. That's why they are free riding here. Are you looking for work? Being employed is necessary, sir. What about you two? -We are also looking for a job. -Are you jobless as well? No. I have started a new business. Not sure what you guys will think if I'll tell you about it. Come on, boss. Okay, I'll tell you because I really like all of you. I am a kidnapper. Sir, have you kidnapped all of them? No. That is just my research. The don'ts of kidnapping. Because the kidnapper who makes news, is the one who gets caught. Sir, we are kidnapped-- Sorry, we are late. Let's go, Teeli. Thanks a lot for the tea. Why are you getting scared? I haven't kidnapped you. -Come on. Please, let's leave. -Sit down! You guys can't leave. I just served you some tea. I'll provide breakfast as well. Don't you have any table manners? You're eating so shabbily with your bare hands. Shall I order more? No, we're done. Shall we leave now? Go, sit in the van. I'll pay the bill. Nice van. Where the hell is he? I'm sleepy. Let's escape with his van. Are you mad? -Let me go! -Shut up! Don't raise your voice. -Let me go! -Wow! He has kidnapped someone! What are you doing? Are you insane? Start driving before the police arrives. I've kidnapped her. Shut up. Shut up! Hurry! Let's escape. She is crying. -Pull over. Let's escape. -Fools! He has kidnapped someone! You guys are planning to run away? They can't hear you. There's no point shouting. You have put us in trouble. I am defending you and you are asking me to shut up! -Take the right turn. -I'm scared! -This is strange! -Just shut up! Shut up, every one! Quiet! Baby, take her phone. Give me your cell phone. Leave her hand. Hold it again. Call her father. What's your father's name? Unstuff her mouth. Tell me his number. It's saved as "Dad". Don't put that dirty cloth in my mouth. Everyone, please shut up! Don't make any noise. Yes, Mariam? Sir, Mariam is with us. We have kidnapped her. What! Dad, they have kidnapped me. Mariam, my dear-- Tell him not to worry. Uncle, please don't worry. We will not harm your daughter. Please don't approach the police. We are not criminals. We are good people. What do you guys want? Uncle, no need to worry. Be patient. Take a deep breath. Okay. Now, tell me. What's your salary? Salary? Do you want to do his taxes? 60000 rupees, my dear. It's the 10th day of the month. What's the balance in your account? Around 50000. Not more than that. If I take that, will you manage the rest of the month? What! Yes, I think I can manage. Fine. Withdraw the money. I'll call you back in fifteen minutes. But, my daughter Mariam? Your daughter is like a sister to me. Just go and get the cash. Yes. Hello, sir! Give me the money. 40000 rupees. Will do. What about Mariam? I'll send your daughter in a while. That's for you. Teeli. And these... are for me. Mr. Babu. How? These are the best rules for kidnapping. First rule. Stay away from powerful people as that involves a higher risk factor. Second rule. Don't threaten to kill and don't try to scare. To save one's life, people are ready to take any kind of risk. Third rule. Make sure that the ransom amount is affordable. Not too less, not too much. Fourth rule. No weapons, no problems. If you carry a gun, you might use it. If you use it, someone might get hurt. That's danger. The fifth and the most important rule. If you get caught, don't act like a hero. Surrender right away. Boss, you can't even spell kidnapping correctly. Come on, let's leave. The class isn't over yet. These are the only five rules. Class dismissed. When is the next mission due? I'm going to break your jaw! Get up! Let's go. Wait! Tomorrow, if you reach here at 6 a.m. we are a team. Or else, you must forget whatever happened today. We have forgotten it, sir. We forgot everything. Am I right? Let's go now. Baby, how are you going to tolerate these guys? I have an idea. Let's become beggars. Are you mad? No one has ever begged in my family. No one from your family has kidnapped anyone either. Don't be obsessed with money. Dignity! Dignity is the most important asset. Let's assume that all of us are trying to find a job. At least one of us will land a decent one. Alright? Alright! Alright. You have been rejected several times. You've been black-listed by the previous company for sexual harassment. Is this the place? Yes. Hey, fatty. Aren't you scared? We have kidnapped you. Baby, he is very cute. Can we adopt him? Do you want anything? Some ice-cream, maybe? Whatever you want to do, do it quickly. I am getting bored. He is getting bored while we are scared. That's my father calling! Have you reached? One day the police will catch you guys and beat you up to a pulp. Are you going to lodge a complain? No. But someday you'll get caught. Just shut up. Why are you scaring us? Get off. Go straight and take the left turn. Your dad is waiting for you there. Keep this. That fat kid has made me nervous. Children speak the truth, very often. Getting scared is futile. That girl wanted to kiss you. It was no big deal. You could've just kissed her. -Or, you should've hooked me up with her. -Just shut up. File a case against them. We'll support you. He is willing to join the gang. From now on, I am a part of your gang. I'll be your accomplice. You won't be able to do it. It's not a decent job. You need to turn into a cold-blooded person. Oh, wow! Baby, you've become an expert at this. Quiet! You are an honest person. I am the most intelligent one. Teeli, please recommend me. Why are you getting into all of this? We are earning for you. Listen, Mr. Babu. When I do something, I do it with all my heart and soul. What sound is that? The sound is coming from your pocket. Baby, I just appreciated you, and you goofed up again. I brought that kid's cell phone by mistake. What do we do? You can pick your phone up from the same location. Are you tracking this call? What is it? Come to the point. Yes. Okay. But we won't come to meet you. You will. Come on. I told you to tie his hands at the back. -I did tie his hands at the back. -Does this look like it? You jerk! -Have we reached the place? -Yes. Who did I speak to, over the phone? I am sitting right in front of you. Thank you for meeting me. Don't thank me. Give me the 50,000 rupees. Yes, I've got it. Don't bother, I'll take it out. What is your name? I am Rahat Siddiqui. Why did you want to meet us? Actually, I want you to kidnap someone. Just the way you had kidnapped my son. Why? Well, actually, to be honest... I want to take revenge from someone. Who do you want us to kidnap? Minister Aijaaz Durrani's son. We can't do it. You may leave. Why can't we do it? Five million is not a small amount. Why are you interfering? You are not even a part of the gang. Why not? I am a part of the gang! Do you want to keep doing petty tasks all your life? Freddy, keep quiet. You are getting a good chance. Just do it. We are not taking this up! That's it! Teeli, see him off. Freddy! -What's going on? -Freddy, what are you doing? Have you gone mad? Why did you do that? Now, he has seen us. Now, we have to take up this task. No. Until he knows where we live, it doesn't matter. That's easy. Turn left from the mobile market and keep going straight on that road. Then, take a u-turn at the signal where there is a betel-leaf seller. At that junction there is an old building. We are on the second floor of that building. I've seen it all. The place is nice. Is it on rent? Mr. Babu. I think he knows magic. -You didn't blindfold him properly! -I think he knows magic. -Shut up! -You both are to blame. Mr. Babu! For God's sake, help me. I beg of you. Please help me. Mr. Babu. He had asked for a bribe from my brother. My brother has to serve a ten year term in prison. His life is ruined. For God's sake, please help me. Baby, we'll have kids in the future. Milk, diapers. School fees. Think about the future. There's no harm in trying. I know that it's against the first rule. But then, there is the fifth rule. We will surrender if we get caught. Let's toss a coin. Heads, we'll do it. Tails, we won't. Get that table. How much is your share from the five million? I don't want any money. I just want to take revenge from him. I just want that minister to get ridiculed in public. What's the name of that minister's son? Bobby. He also had four samosas and two egg wraps. In the evening, he went to the park and ogled upon the girls jogging there. Then, he went back to the tea stall, had five cups of tea and smoked twelve cigarettes. And then he went back home. That's not it. When the girls were jogging, he licked his lips three times. Like this. Are you sure you were observing the minister's son? This guy seems to be a loser. I mean, there's no police and no protocol around him. Let alone protocol, he doesn't have his own car. It's easy to kidnap him. Let's go. Are we going to stop here and wait, Mr. Babu? We will just follow him. We won't kidnap him from here. The goons are going to produce a movie. What? A goon is going to launch a movie. His name is Khan aka Doctor. Doctor? Show me. Baby, shall I audition for this movie? Will you put in a word for me? He is a nut-case. -Do you know him? -Yes. Forget that and focus on the task. You said that the minister won't be home at this time. But I can see his car out there. Yes. But he definitely leaves for office at 9 a.m. You said that he leaves alone. But there is a driver with him. Our observations were limited to one day. We don't know his daily routine. We will only follow him. We won't kidnap him. Let's go. Mr. Babu, why is he following us? Because we are driving in front of him. Slow down. Let him get in front. Keep the engine on. -Come on. -Why did you stop? Start the car! -Get off, hurry up. -Start the car. Hurry up. Open the door. Put him in the car, hurry up. -Come on. -What the hell is going on? Someone is taking away our business. Teeli, follow them. Let's go. -They came this way, right? -Yes. They took a turn here. Mr. Babu, I see their car out there. Switch the engine off. -Get off. -Come outside. -What should we do now? -Go ahead. He is unconscious. Where are the kidnappers? I think the deal didn't work out, so they left him here and ran away. How do we bring him back to his senses? Let's carry him, as it is. -Turn him around. -He is very heavy. Let's go. Hurry up. -Oh, no! -Police? -Cookee, shut the door. -Let's go. Be quick. Hurry up. Let's go. Pari, get inside. Start driving. I'm sure you'll win the elections with a big margin. -What happened? -Sir, someone has kidnapped Bobby. We called your father for ransom and he hung up. Is he mad? What? Unstuff his mouth. Check the news. The culprits, whoever they are. Baby, how do I look? Why are you wearing these hot pants? Since you were tensed, I dressed to please you. Go, get changed and stay quiet for a while. Are you done? Is the minister your biological father? Or, are you adopted? Free his hands and unstuff his mouth. What's the point of having a minister as your father? You'd be better off as an orphan. Will you split the money in half? How should I earn? You don't even get me a job. Please get me a fake degree, at least. What did you just say? I hired those kidnappers. To get some money from my father. What do you say? We split the money? Your mouth was stuffed. Your ears weren't. Your father is not ready to pay a single penny. That's my concern. Are you okay with the deal? No. We are a gang of four. Why split the money in half? Idiots! You picked me up while I was sleeping. I would've smashed you all, had I been awake. You ruined my plan and I am still offering you fifty percent. If it was someone else, he would have paid you only the bare minimum. You guys would be good at petty crimes. Kidnapping is not your cup of tea. I agree with Mr. Bobby. I have no issues. Baby, shall I wear hot pants now? The deal is on. Okay. But, why will your father pay the ransom? Because, I have my mother. Where are you? Mom, please forgive me. Why are you apologizing? Strangle me like this. But don't get carried away. Don't kill me. Let go of me. It is the last time I'll be able to listen to your voice. My son, don't say that. May the Lord protect you. for having married a jerk like your father. And for your strict upbringing. Mom, please don't tell anything to dad. Please don't initiate demonstrations in front of the Chief Minister's house. It will be tarnished. Don't say anything to him even if I die. Bobby, my dear, please don't say that. Dad's reputation is extremely important to me. Bobby! Baby, he should be a part of our gang. -Is there anyone who can give us justice? -And return a mother's love? -Is there anyone who can give us justice? -And return a mother's love? -Is there anyone who can give us justice? -Please save my son! My son's father is a heartless person! All he cares about, is politics. He wants political power. But I want my son! Sir, I'm here to apologize for my wife's behaviour. She is not doing anything wrong. You've never been involved in any kind of corruption. You are a crucial part of the political party. Wonder why you hold the post of a minister? It's because our party's image could improve because of you. Your wife has ruined that for us. She is fond of getting in touch with the media. Will she listen to you? What will the people say? A person who couldn't protect his own son, won't protect the people either. In the elections, if the opposition gives a ticket to your wife against you then your bail will forfeit. Sir, I won't let that happen. Please don't worry. Pay the ransom and bring your son back. That's all we can do. Sir, I'm sure he must've hidden his black money somewhere. Any Swiss bank account? What the hell are you talking about? I've never been involved in any kind of corruption. Pay them five million from the party funds and get it over with. -Okay. -The elections are near. And please don't hit your wife. The media may turn that into another controversy. Tomorrow is a Sunday. We don't work on Sundays. I'll call you on Monday and let you know where to come with the money. You need to send the money with your wife. Are you threatening me? Ready for some romance? If a man wants to be involved in serious social causes, he must not have a family. I'm afraid, they might hurt Bobby. They've asked us not to contact the police. Until we are sure that Bobby is safe, we won't do anything. They're not going to know about this. They are calling. Mom! -Bobby! -Are you getting the money? Bobby, are you alright? Your son is alright, don't worry. Pass the phone to the DIG. -They want to speak to you. -Me? How many people are you bringing along? You are mistaken. I haven't come here as a DIG, I have come to visit my sister. The police cannot be trusted. I assure you that we will not take any action. You can get the police force with you, for all I care! Pass the phone to Auntie. We'll guide her with the route. Is that okay? No need to worry. They'll guide you with the route. Just communicate that with the driver. -Stay strong. -Okay. I'm coming. Yes. Stand right next to it. Okay. What is the situation there? The kidnappers are complete novices. They have called us at a public place. We'll get them easily. -The money is flying, sir. -Flying? It's here! -It's here! -Yes! What's going on? -Sir, the battery is low. What are you doing? I'll catch it and jump on the other side. You think you are Jackie Chan? My men are already downstairs. -Get his loincloth. -Brilliant idea. -Please give us your loincloth! -Hurry up! -Turn around. -It is about to fall down. You dog! I can't believe I've done it! Teeli, stop the car. Boss, I'm the man of the match. Just one wad of notes for me? You want the whole bag? Is that what you want? Pay him some more. So... how is the money going to be distributed? What do you mean? It's decided. We split it in half. Your uncle had involved the entire police force. The drone helicopter was my idea that got us the money. Split it in half, you say? This has been already decided. Mr. Babu, are you listening? Let's go home and discuss this. Leave him! Teeli, drive carefully. Teeli, drive carefully. Freddy! Pari, open your eyes! Pari! Open your eyes, Pari! Pari, open your eyes! Tell me. Baby, I made a mistake. Please forgive me. Don't say that, Pari. I can't see you in trouble. Baby, I'm leaving. I can't live without you. I'll die without you, Pari. Take care of yourself. Pari! No! Pari! Pari! Pari! Pari! Pari! What happened, Mr. Babu? Pari died! Are you going to bury her here itself? Let's just leave. Get up, Mr. Babu. Mr. Babu! Where are we? We are in Bangkok. Where is Bobby? He has gone to get a massage. Obviously, he ran away with the money! You haven't eaten since yesterday. Bobby will reach home safely. You were on a hunger strike when I saw you on TV. I see a meal in front of you now. -Hello, my dear brother. -To hell with your sweet-talk! Do you get paid just to sit comfortably on your chair? Brother! The media is propagating rubbish. This is a new gang. We are trying our best. Let Chaudhry handle the case. -This case can't be given to Chaudhry. -Why? He became a policeman just because he likes to kill people. So? He is insane. No one gets to hear his voice. He doesn't talk, he only hits. I insist. Sit down. I'm sure you've gone through the file. A new gang is involved in this gang. We do not have any clues. It has been four days since-- Keep quiet! Chaudhry, listen carefully. You are against evil. So am I. The only difference is that you have the power of your weapon and I am bound by my principles. I want you to arrest the kidnappers as soon as possible. You have around twelve days. 72 hours only! Within 72 hours, those kidnappers need to be behind bars! So, who's next? Nobody. Those who kidnapped the minister's son are doomed. -Why? -Chaudhry is handling the case now. He'll fire bullets right into their brains! They are doomed for sure. -Look! -Can I look at it, please? The police is under pressure regarding the kidnapping case. SHO Chaudhry is handling the case. Chaudhry? Is he a dangerous person? Person? He is a beast! In the next two days. The corpses of those kidnappers will be found in some gutter. -Mr. Babu? -Who is going to save us now? So, tell me. What's the issue? I've got fever, cough and cold. Open you mouth. I am giving you a note. Go visit a doctor. When he sees this note, he won't take any money from you. Thanks a lot. What's your problem? Doctor, Aslam isn't paying the rent. Can you call him and handle the issue? -What's the rent? -6000 per month. What! You need my services for such a small amount? Get lost! I don't deal with petty cases. We goons have some dignity too! Just a minute. Want to get into acting? Have you acted in plays and dramas during your school or college days? Will you play the lead in my film? The story starts with your wedding. You get divorced in the end. The film will be called "Honeymoon". Sounds good? Good. Very good! Chochi. Chochi? So finally, you remembered your brother. You must be in need of something. You kidnapped the minister's son. And Chaudhry is handling the case! -What shall we do now? -Do this. Get ready to die. For one last time speak to your parents, siblings and girlfriends, if any. "What shall we do?" Just protect yourselves and stay here in hiding. Mr. Khan? What is it, my hero? -I've thought about a scene for the film. -Really? -Can I share it? -Go on. Don't stress your tiny brain. Leave the scenes to me. Work on your body. I want to see six-packs! Chochi, why are you stressing yourself out? I am here for you! I'll ask someone to trace Chaudhry. Don't stress yourself out, okay? Hey, Balma. This is Khan speaking. Mr. Khan! How are you? Long time since we spoke! You are not my girlfriend. We don't need to speak daily. -SHO Chaudhry. -Chaudhry? Mr. Khan, it is going to be very risky. -10,000. -20,000? That's way too much. 15,000. 15,000 sounds good. Consider this task as your audition. -Balma. -Yes? What happened? Injured, already? Mr. Khan, Chaudhry started off with me. -15,000 sounds good. -Consider this task as your audition. Okay, Mr. Khan. Think over it. Think-- -Thank God I was intoxicated. -You're doomed! Sir, I don't know anything. Did you disclose the details? I don't know anything. I swear by my mother! I hope you are telling the truth. If not, you'll be dead meat. Mr. Khan, trust me. I didn't disclose anything. But he will get the information out somehow. Let's see. Mr. Khan, listen to me. Can I get a role in your film? -Role? -Yes. Yes, I do have a role for you. Role of a dead body. What is it? What do you want? What's the matter? I had already sent your allowance. This man is Chaudhry. Chaudhry? Boss, you can arrest us right away. But please don't do anything else. Breakthrough in the kidnapping case. The SHO got rid of one gang. There's revelation of another gang's involvement. The police is determined to nab the other gang very soon. The police has also announced a prize for the one who gives them any lead. Mr. Babu, to hell with your five rules of kidnapping! Chaudhry is on the lookout. And we are doomed. The police doesn't know anything about us. If they did, they wouldn't have announced the prize money. -Chochi, where are you? -At home. Leave right away. -Why? -Chaudhry knows where you are. What's wrong? -Police. -I knew it. Mr. Babu, this isn't the time to get emotional! Let's run! How did the police know? Someone revealed the details for the prize money. A man called Rahat Siddiqui tipped them about you. I knew that man was a cheat! Technically, Bobby is the actual criminal. Yes. It was all his plan. And he took the money as well. And here we are! Dealing with Chaudhry. If I had to deal with this, I'd re-do everything. Okay. We will kidnap him once again. Trust me, Chochi. A new way of dealing with the issue! You guys must surrender. And then, in court, you will say that all of it is just a big blunder. We'll surrender only after trying something else for one last time. Mr. Khan is right-- I need one car and one bike. -Chochi! -I want a car and a bike, that's it. He is very stubborn. Sir, it was a nightmare to me. I was unconscious and they didn't even feed me. They had kept me in a dark room. And they used to blindfold me whenever they took me out. -Bobby. What was that sound? -Nothing, Mom. Don't you read the newspaper? The gang which kidnapped you earlier, has revealed everything to Mr. Chaudhry. Mr. Chaudhry shot them right in the head. Now, you must speak the truth. Well... Honestly... I don't know anything at all. Do you know what this card means? To be on the safer side, reveal everything until 6 p.m. Mr. Babu, it's Chaudhry! Let's get out of here. Don't look towards him. I don't have any matchsticks, sir. I can hear gunshots from all directions! Shut up! Let's go! -Mr. Babu, he is here. -Oh, no! Get out of the car. Raise your hands. Or else, I'll shoot. You can't carryout an encounter here. This is a residential area. Get out of the car. Be quick. -Lord, save us. -Get out of the car. -Dear Lord! We weren't running away. -Get out of the car. -Keep moving. -Trust us. -The car breaks have failed. -Come on. -Stand straight. -I'll beat you up! Keep walking. Hands up. For your safety. I've pointed a gun towards you. Why does that make you smile? Take what you need and leave quickly. Black car? Sure. On my way. Catch him! Hurry! Put him in the car! -What are you doing? -Start the car! Hurry! Get me some tea. Black? Or, with milk? Sir, please spare me. I don't know anything I was just passing by. Please believe me, I'm innocent. Let me go. -Lift me up. -Yes? Must be somebody like me. I wasn't even there, sir. -Sir, we've got bad news. -Please, sir. The kidnappers have surrendered. Don't loosen the grip. I will fall down. Sir, I'll tell you! I was the 12th man. Sir, I swear. I was the 12th man-- Get inside. We are getting late. Dear Lord, bless us! They are here! Hurry up. Take your positions. -Sir! Please! Which gang do you belong to? -Why have you surrendered? -Answer us. -Do you belong to a gang? -Did you surrender out of fear? -Why is the opposition supporting you? -I need to speak to the press. -You can't stop them from speaking to us. You need to give us an answer, sir. We did not try to escape on our way here. We have no such intentions. Mr. Chaudhry would kill us in an encounter using our desire to escape as an excuse. If anything bad happens to us, Mr. Chaudhry will be solely responsible. Mr. Chaudhry, is that true? -Answer us, Mr. Chaudhry. -What do you have to say? -Were you planning their encounter? -Move. -Sir, please answer. -Please make way. -Sir, you must answer us. -We need answers! Careful. Look at them closely. Are they the ones who had kidnapped you? I swear by my father, I won't tell them anything. Okay. You may go. -No. -What! I'll be rotting in prison. Are you sure you didn't tell anything to Chaudhry? Absolutely sure. Where is the money? The money is with me. And I'm still ready to split the amount in half. You will have to promise us something. What kind of a promise? We don't want any money. Just don't tell anything to the police. You don't need to be afraid. They can't harm you. No... they are not my kidnappers. And now, the government will bring this case to its conclusion. The Lawyer representing the case! Your star witness has backed off. The case has concluded itself. Mr. Chaudhry. I can't believe that this is your case. I agree that this is a high profile case. But that doesn't mean you can arrest random people and present them in court. Go and arrest the real culprits. We are safe! Mr. Babu, now we can return the tape to Bobby and split the money. Then, I can start working on my abdominal muscles to build a six-pack for my film. Any idea... who would be starring opposite me? Shut up. I'll speak as much as I like because we've just escaped death. Let me celebrate the happiness. -Oh, no! Wait! -Stop! Damn it! My film! Cookee! Calm down. For God's sake, control your anger. What are you talking about? You scoundrel! -Durrani, listen! Please! -I am going to drain his blood! -Please don't do this. Let him go. -Mom, say something. Stop him. Do not interfere! Just keep quiet! Yes? Have they left? Do you know the place? Your guests are arriving. Start driving. -Why are you creating a ruckus? -Come here! Where did you get this money from? Answer me! Don't you dare run away! Answer me. Let him go. -Mom! -Stay out of this. Please leave! I am going to kill him. He is not at fault! You have compelled him to commit the crime. What did you just say? Let's go outside. Don't you understand? -You have spoilt him-- -Bobby! -Bobby, my dear! -Bobby, open the door. Bobby, open the door. Bobby, open the door. Open the door, Bobby! -Open the door, I say! -Bobby, my dear. If you don't open the door, I'll call the police and hand you over to them. Open the door! Bobby! Please don't hurt yourself, my son. What's wrong? Break the door. Move aside. You have spoilt him. Break the door. It's quiet in there. Bobby, my dear! -Bobby! -Don't you dare run away. I will bury you alive! But I won't let you run away. Now you will stay behind bars all your life. Tell me the truth. Where has Chaudhry taken them? The court had released them. Are you sure? If I don't find them there, you'll be doomed. Bloody hell! I can't see anything. It's too dark. Chaudhry! He is here. He is here. He is here! He is here! Teeli! Freddy! Chaudhry, I challenge you to hit us with lights on! Mr. Babu, don't instigate him. Chaudhry! Don't hit Mr. Babu. I dare you to hit me, instead. This is how one gets busted in the dark. Hurry up, sir. The seniors are calling. They are asking about you. Boss, I can't see anything here. Keep your eyes on the road. You don't need to look around. -Okay, Mr. Khan. -Go ahead, keep driving. That is Chaudhry's car. But Chochi and his friends aren't here. Keep driving. Sir, I tried to stop him but he didn't listen to me. Sir, I am really sorry to barge in like that. I need to discuss something very important. What is it? I didn't know that I was fostering someone so dangerous. Take the five million that belongs to the party fund. Sir, I... -Are you drunk? -I... I had seen the money. Five million... -Sit down. -Yes, sir. You must visit a good doctor. Sir, my son. My son has ridiculed me. I can no longer face anyone. His kidnapping case... was a plan that was created by himself. What! Yes, sir. It was his idea. I am ordering you to let him go. Ma'am, I could die, for all I care. But I can't let him go. Mom, let me talk to him. -Take this. -What is this, Bobby? -Keep it. You might need it. -Bobby! Chochi! Chochi! Put them in the car. Careful. Chaudhry, I won't spare you. I will torture you, you scoundrel! Be careful. Be careful of your foot! Slide them in carefully. Mr. Khan, how did you find us? I have a few friends in the police force. They are fond of acting. Right, Gringo? I have made all the arrangements. All of you need to leave. You guys are leaving this city. I'll take care of everything here. Hey! Why are you here? I want to speak to Mr. Babu. 2.5 million for you. We do not need any kind of charity. -Why are you here? -You kidnapped me twice. You could have harmed me. But you let me go. This isn't charity. It's your rightful share. The police might be looking for me. What do you want from me? Help me out of this city. After I use all my share, I'll return and join your gang. Mr. Babu! The minister's son! You! I don't understand anything. What's going on? I don't know. Before anyone else intervenes and takes you along... I'll make arrangements to send you away. I don't understand one thing. I wonder why Chaudhry... didn't kill you. This is a service pistol. There will be questions raised. I think it's rusted. Why did you do that, sir? Hey, come out. He got himself busted! He shot himself! Sir got busted. Sir got shot. His condition is critical. Why did he shoot himself? Hurry up. Call the police. I mean, call the ambulance. -What happened? -Help me. He is too heavy. Help me, don't just keep looking. Let's use the boot. Hurry up. Sir, keep your rear lifted high. Hurry up. Let's go. Really? Take it. I will kill you! Sit down. Can you earn 300 million in a year? What! For the elections this time, your father won't get the ticket. You will. Your father has caused a lot of damage to the party. He has never indulged in any sort of corruption. So, you will have to compensate for that. We will form a government, next time as well. Make as much money as you can. Anything above 300 million will be yours. -Sir, you can't do this. -I'm not talking to you. Are you in? Yes. Wow! Your response has delighted me. If this is how it's going to be, I'll end my association with the party. You are no longer needed for political purposes. You'd rather go on a pilgrimage with your wife. Why are you doing this? -Please try to understand. -You need to leave, sir. -Please leave. -You are not listening to what I'm saying. He is an evil person. You fooled your father. Now, fool the public. This is politics. Now, go. Prepare for the election campaign. Long live Babar Durrani! Sir, what are your plans if you win the elections? Self-belief and "artwork" will always earn you success! Sir, "hard-work". Not "artwork". Long live Babar Durrani! Long live Babar Durrani! Alright. But... tell me. How much money did you bring? Five million. Can we meet the minister now? I'm afraid not. He doesn't meet anyone offering less than 50 million. He is a busy person. But don't worry. He has two important representatives. If they agree, your problem will be solved. But... You cannot meet them just like that. It's necessary. Please understand. You never know when someone makes a video and it goes viral on YouTube. What is the score, boss? His country is filled with black money. The machine is overused. SHO, please take the money to our boss. I need to see some romance! I am re-taking it for the last time. If you aren't able to bring a romantic expression on your face, I'll kill you and bury you right here! Roll the camera and load the gun. Fourth rule. No weapons, no problems. If you carry a gun, you might use it. If you use it, someone might get hurt. Mr. Babu. Pari!
