[country music playing] [singing] Some folks call me a laughing boy, some say I'm a clown. But till you try my way of life-- Moiry, it's your last bath, so I hope you're clean. [gun shots] Bye, sweetheart. BOSS: Messy, very messy. And Moiry's only half dead. He's in a coma. BOSS: Messy. OK, I give you that New Mexico territoroes-- the rackets, the high-jackers. If you can take them. What do you mean? BOSS: There's a tough old broad running Moiry's turf out there. You've got to get rid of Annie and her cowboys. You gotta-- you gotta force her out. You gotta-- you gotta get to the local police. We could handle it. Just got a little truckstop-- you can work out of there. Eh, and the financing? There's a half a million dollars worth of securities moving to the territory from a New York job. - Yeah? Yes. You intercept these securities, there's your financing. If you ever get to the West Coast, never heard of you. Don't worry about it. We can handle it. This time, use a little bit of class. OK, you can go. Smith? Take a little tip-- don't pick up any hitchhikers out there. Especially broads-- it ain't safe. [laughs] [country music playing] Hi! Hi. Much obliged to you for stopping. I was just saying to my friend Tina here that if you didn't stop, I was going to get right in the middle of that highway and cry. What's the matter? She thinks it's the generator, but I think it's the battery. We was just on our over to Radio Springs, and suddenly the engine just up and quits. [grunting] TOGETHER: (SINGING) Just remember the Red River Valley, and the sweetheart loved you so true. Come and sit by my side, little darling-- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile. Yes, remember the Red River Valley-- and the sweetheart who loved you so true. [theme] THEME SONG: Truck stop women, yeah, still swimmin'. Truck stop women, about to blow my mind. Heads. Tails. Funny, you're always gettin' tail. THEME SONG: I was driving all day, and I was gettin' kind of tired. I was looking for a place to ease my pain. Hadn't had a cup of coffee in 150 miles-- Come on in, baby. Ain't you never seen a honey trucker before? THEME SONG: Just a truck drivin' man on the road again. Well, I came around the corner, saw the red lights flashing on the neon sign, and I to grin. There's a 30-foot picture of a girl in a bikini on the truck stop route, and I lit on in. When I came through the door, there was something kind of funny-- there were girls all around me, not a man in sight. And the waitress grinned, and she winked when she said, how about a truck stop special, so I said all right. Truck stop women, my head's still swimming. Truck stop women, about to blow my mind. mile. Well, I was waiting for my coffee when a man came in-- didn't see me or nothing, but he left with a smile. I was really getting hungry. So I yelled for the waitress, and she laughed when she said, just a little while. Then a pretty young girl came and sat down beside me, said, what you waitin' for, truck driving man? Said, I been waiting 20 minutes for my truck stop special. And she looked at me and said, honey, here I am. Truck stop women, heads still spinning. Truck stop women about to blow my mind. [engine roaring] [buzzing] Yeah? MAC (ON PHONE): Anna? Rose just come in with a truck. Get on it, Mac. Get Rose for LA as soon as the paint's dry. But hell, Anna, just go here. Get on it! [muttering] Hey, Rose. You got it, honey! Of course we got it. We weren't out there screwing around. Ha. Lay off, creep. All right, Winter. Get to work. Paint it white. Ah, Mac. Paint it pink. Your ma said white. Screw my ma. Paint it pink. Anna said white. Screw Anna. I'd rather try you. Ew. They're talking about making love. How about you and I making tracks over at the motel. You better check that drive shaft before you take it out. [sniffs] Well, I got something to fix your drive shaft. [laughter] That little bitty monkey wrench? [laughs] Hell, Tina. Come on, Mac, paint it pink-- for us. Why shit, we stole it. We ought to be able to paint it any color we want. Come on, Tina. Come on, Winter. Get that spray gun going, we ain't got all night. For me, Mac. Paint it pink. Get out of here. [laughs] Monkey wrench! [laughs] Up the hill. [vrooming sound] And around the top. [driving sound effects] And down into the valley! [screaming] She's really a tiger. Another letter from my mother, wanting to know when I'm going to get married. You know, if Mama had a lick of sense, she'd start selling booze in this place. Nobody would let their drivers stop. They'd stop. You are so smart. Well, you just wait around and watch. Your about to lose that pretty mouth full of teeth you got, mister. Forget about it, Rusty. She's a little tiger. No offense, Rose. Why don't you sit down? I'd like to buy you dinner. I'd rather eat in a barn. Let her go, Rose. She hasn't the class that you have. You got some class, ma'am. You two got an act going, or something? Excuse me. Smith's the name. This here's my partner, Rusty. How you doing? You know, I know you name, Rose, because people been telling me about you. They're saying that you ought to run this place, and not your mother. [shrieking] WOMAN (ON VIDEO): Giddy up, boy! Come on-- WOMAN (ON VIDEO): Please stay some more. Don't leave yet. MAN (ON VIDEO): Got a run to make, honey. WOMAN (ON VIDEO): What's so important that you got to leave me. MAN (ON VIDEO): Hell, hauling some damn electronic equipment for some damn TV network. WOMAN (ON VIDEO): The network can wait. Ah, just let me rub you down. Then you'll be able to haul that old equipment twice as fast. Good girl, Sandra. Mac. MAC (ON PHONE): Yeah. Send Curly out to hurry to check a KW with Kentucky plates, 4LT 890. Electronic equipment-- if it's transmitters, we got an order for some. You know, I understand you're kind of a woman that's not completely satisfied rubbing shoulders with the cop boys and truckers. See, you're headed for better things. Yeah? Well, it sounds like a lot of crap to me. Well, how would you like to spend the rest of your life in a place like this? You got it? Like a brief. [laughs] Good girl. Who are them fellas? Just some guys I just met. Hey, honey? Flannigan and his partner are coming by later tonight. And I was wondering-- God dammit, Mama-- just dump it! I'm done working for tonight. Would Jackie Onassis eat a chicken fried steak? What the hell's the matter with her? What's eating her? I don't know. She's been like that all day. [yelling] [laughing] Howdy, fellas? What can we do for you? Oh, you a trucker? Yeah, you probably could use one of Anna's trucker specials. Sandy! One of them songs. Be nice to them now, ya hear? You crazy, injun, you're going to kill me someday! Get in my way, I will! I won't put gas in your tank next time! ANNA: Mighty fine job tonight. One of them KW tractors. Driving in your damn bedroom! [laughs] Say-- you know them fellas Rose left with? A couple of goons, if you ask me. You know, she sure clobbered that driver. What's eating her? Beats me. See ya later, Tina, Chuck. Wonder where all these trucks are coming from, for crying out loud. Your tank's full. Hey, how's your old lady? I don't know. You don't know? Pretty good, I seen her last night. You did? Hey, Curly? Hurry up, wlll ya? [suspenseful music] Eh, we don't like to talk about it. All right, sweet heart, we got to go. Well, if we see ya later. Come on, Rusty. Hey, Flannigan? [laughs] You like to scared me half to death. You're early. No, I got the assignment later on up in Lawrenceburg and thought we'd get the kinks off first. [laughs] Want a ride over? Sure. How's business? Being run to death by amateurs. Moral of this country is going to hell. I swear to god-- every waitress on the highway's got hinges on her heels. [laughter] Now, you just relax, honey. Hey, Sandra! Lorine! Your white knights is here! SANDRA: Hold it, we're not ready yet! [giggles] Not ready, hell. Y'all have fun, ya hear? [humming] What's the matter? You got something against women? You want to tell me about it? I ain't got nothing against women, baby. Now why don't you, uh, go see if Anna's ready to talk to me, yet. Oh, c'mon. I ain't gonna tell you twice, sweet heart. Now get outta here. OK! OK! Don't get so twitchy! Anna! Listen, that dude don't want nothing to do with me. He's just sitting in there waiting for you. For me? Yeah. Tell me, is he on the run or something? Well, how the hell would I know? [sighs] All right, I'll talk to him. But you wait here, right there. Oh, OK. You got Trish thinking she ain't adequate. Well, next to you, she ain't. Can it. Now, what's really on your mind? Money. Big surprise. OK, how much do you need? Moiry's dying. Somebody pumped six bullets into him yesterday morning. Whole LA operation's going to pieces. Two punks named Smith and Rusty-- they're here tonight. They want you out of New Mexico. And eastern money is coming to back them up. That's where I come in. And you, too, if you want. Sure is getting deep in here. [coughing] So how about the money shipment? I know where, and I know when. Why should those two punks have all that loot, when my old friend Anna could be cut in so easy? Because your old friend Anna, she ain't tangling with no eastern mafia. [screaming] Talk to you later. Anna? You're going to want in. Ain't too much time left. Now, come on, honey-- don't run away from the sheriff. Now, I'm going to have to handcuff you-- Now my feet! Not your feet? [laughter] I'm going to inform you about your rights. And anything you say is going to be held against you. OK, honey, now hold still. Come on, let's have your little hand here. You going to come nice and quiet now? Uh-oh-- come on. Let's go with the sheriff. Come on, baby. Keep an eye on him. OK. OK, honey. I'm going to have to frisk you, check you out for weapons. I'm gonna take a chance. Oh, you're clean. OK, to bed. [whistling] Hey! Oh! Hey! Hey, hold it! [laughing] [honking horn] What in the hell do you think you're doing? Hold it, hold it! That ain't fair! ANNA: Hey! Hey! What the hell's going on here? What started it? Who the hell knows. You know how they are, Anna. You go call LA, see if you can get a hold of Moiry. See if anything fishy is going on. Pronto! Come on, Mac! Come on, Mac! [laughter] Rose get you to do this? Yeah, but you know, I-- She probably told you I said do it? And I told her-- Where's the manifest? 257 color TVs! Whoo-ee! Mac, we've struck it rich this time! Oh, did you have to paint it such a tacky color? Well, I wouldn't have done it, but you know, she's just a kid, Anna. Well, it's OK, Mac. Hey-- [suspenseful music] Some guys. Who? I don't know. It's a real nice coffee shop you got. Well, what you get at Anna's is satisfaction. I sure the hell hope so. Who the hell are you? Smith's the name. Talked to you on the phone, from LA. Oh, yeah, howdy. This here's Anna. Pleased to meet you. You must be Mac. Hi ya. Go get the truck, Rusty. This here's the load that's coming to you. What are you all doing here? I thought I was supposed to deliver it in LA tomorrow. This here's the authorization to take delivery here. You see, we're changing the operation a little bit. Mr. Moiry R. said so. Hey, watch it! That ain't Moiry's signature. Yeah, I know. He's been a little sick, the guy. That's good, Rusty. Hey, Moiry didn't tell me nothing, though, about loading. Hey, Mac! What the hell do you think I repaint these things for, my health? Lady, I don't know why you do anything. Here, get that stuff there, Rusty. Wait a minute. You ain't taking nothing. You got a check there, don't ya? I'd get more than this in a dozen places. Yeah, maybe so, but we're going to take it. I mean, everything is in order. You're just ain't getting paid for delivery to LA. Whoa! Now you're messing around in my territory! Moiry and I took years to build this-- Hold it! Let's get a couple of things straight! I don't care what you or Moiry did. Things are changing. Now we're taking this. You ain't going to be able to use those color TVs, because they're going to have blood splattered all over them in about two minutes. Now, get rid of that peashooter, you hear? [suspenseful music] Want me to blast them? Now, hold on. I mean, we can talk this out. What do we got to say? The syndicate is changing, Anna. I mean, you can't go swooping down on these trucks on a highway, like Calamity Jane. You cut out that Calamity Jane crap! Let me bust them. Back off, Winter. I'm warning you-- you and Moiry are finished. Forget about it. You get you and your truck out of here before I forget my naturally sweet disposition, and turn Winter loose on you. Now you get! Let's get out of here, Rusty. Son of a bitch. [laughing] Anna, I talked on the phone like you told me. Well, Moiry got shot. There's a lot of hands that are quitting out in LA. Let me go get some of the boys and go get them. No, send Chuck. See where they go. But Anna, Rose went with them. Let me go get them. No, let them be. They ain't played the hand out, yet. You and Curly, you go on over and make that pick-up in Lawrenceburg tonight, like we planned. Well, go on! See if you get back before day. Come on, Winter. I thought you big shots said you could handle it. Well, what do you want us to do? Shoot up the place? You been hanging around too many cowboys. Now you're with the class. Yeah, class. I'm gonna take you out of this. You're gonna make a big hit in Vegas. Well, look, you said you'd take care of Mama first. Don't worry about here. I'll take care of her kid. I ain't no kid. Wait, how do you like my new truck stop? And how do you like the new sign? The H don't work. I'm going to get that fixed, like everything else. That stupid sign cost me more money to buy than after the sheriff, himself. Stool pigeon. You're pretty sweet. Madeline, none of the gals goes out without an armed man on the job, OK? MADELINE (ON PHONE): Trouble, Anna? Liable to be. Tighten all security around the place. MADELINE (ON PHONE): Gotcha. Did you talk to LA? Yeah, they said the truck stop is yours-- if you help us knock off Anna and the boys. Hmm. I guess that'll show Mama I ain't no kid no more. And I owe it all to you. This is going to be one debt I don't mind paying. Oh, baby. In LA, they said you girls were hicks. [wistful music] Now, I'm going to show you some of the only good tricks my mama taught me. [music playing] Here we go-- about eight blocks down to Hickory Street. Yeah. Then we got two blocks-- says three blocks to corner of Hickory, and what the hell is this? I can't ever read this goddamn woman's writing! Oh, you stupid goddamn cowboy-- it's typed. I know, but it's all crossed out here. [laughs] Hey, I know I was saying that to upset you, but ain't that-- Shit, Curly, it's a damn set-up! Goddamn-- shame to leave that truck behind. Let's get it. OK. We're gonna have to smash them to keep them from following us. Well, hell, let's just mix them up a little bit then, huh? [laughs] [sirens] [laughter] [crashing] Oh, that was nasty. What the hell we gonna do now? Don't worry, Curly. I got an idea. [engines roaring] [sirens] [honking] No! My car! [country music playing] [music playing] Girlie ain't back yet. Yeah, I know. You know, something's going on around here. Some guy named Smith offered me job over on the interstate at twice my salary. I didn't trust him, so I told him where to go. Thanks, Trish. Don't you worry. They're in trouble. I know where to go. Night Trish. Night. [coughing] She ain't back yet. It's tough, huh. Guess I'm going to have to drag her back. My own daughter. [coughing] Seems like back East there was this safe deposit robbery. And there's about a quarter million dollars in securities moving this way. I don't want to mess with that end of the racket, Seago. I got a good thing going here. You had a good thing going here, honey. [suspenseful music] [honking] [laughing] Where in the hell have you been? And what in the blue blazes have you done to my truck? Look at this! That is an easy $800 worth of damage. Did you two run into each other? Jesus Christ! All right, dammit, Anna, that's it! I quit! I swear to God and I ain't coming back, neither. We been busting our butt all night. And we been laying our life on the line-- and this is the thanks we get? It was a damn set-up, Anna, we barely got away. At least six, eight cop cars out there, and about a million police. And this is the thanks we get. I tell you right now, I got an uncle in Little Rock just be tickled pink to have me working for him. We like to got killed. That'd be a hell of a loss. [laughing] [country music playing] [MUSIC - RED SIMPSON, "I'M A TRUCK"] MAN: [singing] You've heard songs about truck drivers, many times their story's told, how they pulled out of Pittsburgh for six days on the road. 'Bout that feather river canyon, climbing the old grape vine, that old roadhouse down in Texas, and the girls they left behind. You've heard their tales of daring, and I think that's just fine-- but if you can spare a minute, I'd like to tell you mine. There's be no truck drivers, if it weren't for us trucks. No double-clutching gear jammin' coffee drinking nuts. They'll drive their way to glory, and they have all the luck-- there'd be no truck drivers, if it wasn't for us trucks. If we're on time, he takes the credit. If we're late, I get the blame. Up those hills with shutters open, my stacks a-runnin' flame. My tach' runnin' red-line, sucking diesel from the tanks. I'll take him south, bring him back, without a word of thanks. So now you've heard my story, and I guess it's my tough luck-- there'd be no truck drivers, if it wasn't for us trucks. There'd be no truck drivers, if it wasn't for us trucks. No double-clutching, gear jammin' coffee drinking nuts. They'll drive their way to glory. They have all the luck. There'd be no truck drivers, if it wasn't for us trucks. There'd be no truck drivers if it wasn't for us trucks. ANNA: What's wrong with her? What do you suppose she's up to? She's just a kid, Anna, hell fire. (MOCKING) She's just a kid, Anna, hell fire. Ease off her a little bit. Hey Anna, did the syndicate build this, or the oil companies? ANNA: Same difference. [country music playing] [yelling] Dammit, you ain't creeping on me, young lady! I am done with you and your stupid cowboys. Oh yeah? Good bye, truck lady! Hey! C'mon Mac! [music playing] [tires screeching] RUSTY: Pull over, you fat bastard! MAC: Fat bastard, huh? RUSTY: That girl belongs to Smith! MAC: Well now we got her! RUSTY: Pull that son of a bitch over before I knock you off the road! MAC: Oh yeah? Hang on! Hang tight, dammit! Get her back in there! C'mon, baby, get your head back in there! [yelling] [alarm] [screaming] Shit, a guy getting killed in this wreck. By blood, Smith's gonna be mad. Goddam-- ruined my truck. My poor truck-- shit. Shit! I'll show them-- them son of bitches. [grunting] [laughing] Oh, shit! Goddam-- kids. [suspenseful music] Mac? That you? [hissing sound] Oh, uh? No! MAC: Of all the dirty, low-down, sleeking, conniving, backstabbing, belly-robbing, underhanded, lousy, stinking poke-hander tricks! We're going to get him for this. [chuckles] Oh, we're going to in spades. Put Chuck's body in the back room for now. Can't we call someone? Now this is murder. You want to call the cops? Oh, hell, Anna! It weren't no accident! Get down here. Where you been? You think I had something to do with that? Smith's behind it, honey. Maybe he the one who done it, maybe not. But Smith is behind it. God dammit, just dump it now, mama. Why the hell do we get suck with this kind of shit? I don't like it no better than you do. Yeah, but you never say nothing. Look, you got a job to do, right? Then do it, and quit your bitching. All right, I'll do it, but I'm allowed to bitch. Give me that hammer. Where's the nail? Ah, god damn it! Oh, Curly, shut up. [banging] Mac. [suspenseful music] Serves you right, you bastard. I ain't pushing you, honey. But I have got to know who is with me, and who is against me. Now Winters is done run off, and he is probably driving for that dude right this minute. Come on. You know I'm always with you. Like mother-- That's my girl. After I pull this big job, I'm going to buy you $10,000 worth of anything. I promise. [laughing] Tell me what it is-- maybe I can help. No, it's a secret now, honey. But you come on-- I got a job for you tonight. [moaning] Hey, baby. You have a good sleep? I'm all rested up now. You ever sleep? Only when I'm alone. That's enough now. You still want me to ask Anna about a job? Yep. What are you qualifications? Oh, two years at Barrysville for assault, three years at Quentin for robbery, and six months in the county jail for assault with a deadly weapon. But they never pinned that one on me. They're gonna need guns for things around here. Can you use a gun? Now, what do you think? I know first hand you sure can use a gun. You been thinking about what I told you? About the money? No, about the securities. Hey, y-- that stuff that happened at my place, it won't happen again. I promise. Good. Does it fit? Seems to. Good. Listen, we got to move fast. I hear this ratty-looking guy, Seago, around. You seen him? No, I ain't seen him. What do you want him for? Me and him did a job together back East. I just haven't seen him lately. You sure he hasn't been here? Look, I told you I ain't seen him. Beautiful. Now you look like a high-class doll. You're going to look good in those casinos in Las Vegas. Forget about it. What about Mama? Don't worry about Mama-- I take care of her. You know something? I think I love you. [giggles] Well, I got her back. For how long? Ah, Seago-- Rose and I had trouble, but nothing like this. Damn sneak. I'll tell you what, huh-- you help me get them securities, we'll put Smith out of business. You got yourself a deal, cowboy. No city son of a bitch is going to run me out of my own territory. 50/50. Right down the line. [country music playing] Hey, Mac. Is your eye feeling better? It's OK. What's the matter? It's Chuck, isn't it. We're gonna get them guys, don't you sweat about it. Anyway, after the big job we're all going to have plenty of money. What big job? Mama and Seago are planning it, I reckon. You don't know nothing about it? Then I guess they ain't planning on cuttin' you in. I'm getting five thou. I'll see you later. Me and Tina got a big job. She sure is some gal. Sure is some bitch. Ah, Maddie. Someday, there's gonna be some old trucker come down that highway. And he's gonna run you up and down the road until you drop dead. Well, I wish to hell he'd hurry up. I'll drink to that. Jesus Christ it's cold. How many have passed us by today? Seven. What, are we supposed to be naked or something out here to get them to stop? Will you shut up-- you're starting to sound just right like Curly. Here comes another one now! With our luck, it's some fellow hauling chickens. God damn, there's got to be a better way. That son of a bitch better stop, that's all I got to say. He's gonna stop. - Oh! Come on! Thank you! You ready to fix our car? [grunts] [music playing] Got any kids, Seago? Mm-hmm. So helpless when they're babies. Rose? Double-cross me so fast, makes my head swim. Smith, for sure. She's hardly more than a murderer herself. How do kids get mixed up with people like that? Well, she's a grown woman now. The hell, you say. This will sound funny-- but I used to think on the day when me and Rose would run the place together. Well, I guess she, uh, figures she don't need you anymore. That's just what she thinks. Oh, hell. Oh, I guess I'm just getting old. [moaning] You're tight. Why don't you lie down-- I'll massage your whole back. [suspenseful music] I'll be right out. What's the matter? It's all right, it's just a piss stop. You've got a flat on your inside dual. Is that right? [laughing] [silenced gun shots] Hey, baby! You know, I missed you. Yeah, I missed you, too. Jesus, did he have to-- Never mind. The guy, uh, tried to fight us. I mean, what could we do? Look at me when I talk to you. We're going to cover the trail, right? Yeah, but god damn it, Smith-- Forget about it. What's the story with your mother? Mama's got a big job planned. I don't know exactly what it is-- but I do know she promised me five grand just to help. And that guy, Seago? Well, he must have something to do with it. Mama can't get that kind of money on the road. Hi, Rose. See your ma gave your a shiner. Get lost. She's a little tiger, Rusty. Listen, there's certain things we got to do. Right? I mean, you understand. Still makes me sick. Listen to me. Just think about the five grand you're going to get. OK? Get the truck, Rusty. Ciao, sweet heart. Oh, give her a good line. It'll work. Disgusting pig. Mama? OK, honey. Come on in, as soon as you can. Hear? Bye, honey. Bastard. They killed Ed. Took the truck and left Rose at the gas station. OK, Seago, what's the deal? I hear it is a coming in on a cattle truck, circle D Bar None. Mean anything to you? Sure, that's old Billy's run. Got too drunk to work for me anymore. You don't mean Billy's carrying the securities? I doubt if he knows it. We're going to have to leave Rose behind. She's coming with us. Can't trust her. That's what I'm going to find out. Now, you listen to me-- Now, Seago-- I'm still her mother. Half this deal is mine. Now, we've had some sweet times together, honey. But if you try to mess me up, or go after Billy on your own, I'll make sure you don't make it across the state line. You hear me? Now, I'll meet you at the ghost town. And we'll make the split, just like you planned. There it Is, Mac. Just in black and white, just as plain as day. Just see it. What are we going to do, Mac? Just take a look at it. Mac, would you look at this? Now, it shows you-- Ed's been killed. That does it, Mac. I'm gonna walk right up to her damn office, and I'm gonna tell her she can take this job and stick it right00 Mac, will you look at this? Now, there's just you and me. What's the matter, Mac? C'mon, Curly-- we got miles to drive before sun up. What? We got a job in Nevada. The contact's my old friend, Seago. So come on, let's go. There's something I want to talk to you about. It's right here, just as-- Shut up, Curly. Come on, Mac-- we're going after cattle. Cattle? You crazy? Plum loco! [laughs] But we are gonna be rich enough to buy ourselves a loony bin! Heehee! Whoo! Now, Mac, look at this! It's right here in black and white! It just says it's-- [MUSIC - DAVE DUDLEY, "BULLSHIPPERS"] Hey, how you doing, Billy? Curly, what the hell you doing here? Just passing time. Out in the desert? Yeah. Hey, Billy-- you run a bunch of steer from Circle D ranch over near Elko to Bar None spread near Las Cruces? Yeah, [inaudible]. Billy, what the hell? Put the gun down. You guys not interested in cattle. Billy, I know. But you know Anna. I got my orders. Well, I'll be damned. Orders is orders. Well, I guess that's about got you. Now, you all right? You comfortable? Well, if you'll be obliged, you'll give me my bottle back. [chuckles] You don't mind if I have a little swig first? Well, no. You count this one off because I owe you one. Now you take care, you hear? Don't do me that a way! [MUSIC - DAVE DUDLEY, "BULLSHIPPERS"] No trouble at all. Billy said to say hi. [laughter] Hi, Rose. Hi, Curly. [cows mooing] [yelling] Maybe it's false floor. Sure stinks in here. Well, that's money to me. I suppose you want me to get down on four and grub for it. I suppose you want to get paid! I suppose i grub. Suppose you do. Hey-- here it is. Hey, here's another one! And another one! Leave them! I think the whole floor's paved with them! See what's in this! That's it. Oh! Hey, look at this! Ain't that something? Where'd you get that? This? Pretty, ain't it. Just found it on the garage floor. Near Winter's body? Yeah. Seago. All right. That does it.
