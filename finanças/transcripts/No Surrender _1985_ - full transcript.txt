[music playing] [QUIETLY] Come on. Come on! [car door opens] [car door closes] [footsteps approaching] Billy? That's you, isn't it, Billy? It's me. [laughs] Billy! Billy boy! You and me, Billy. Me and you. Billy the Beast and me, eh? [laughs] What is it you want? There are things I have to do. I have obligations tonight. Here's me, all the way overfrom Belfast, just to see you, special. You and me were friends, Billy. We fought together. That's an obligation in itself, surely. Is it? Course it is. How dare you? I've kept in touch. In me own fashion. Not sure that I've noticed. NORMAN: Oh, but I have, Billy. I have. You'd be surprised. Nothing surprises me these days, Norman. Not even this. [inaudible], how about we drink, Billy, eh? For old times' sake and the new year coming, eh? No. You don't get a good pint in there. Not at first. Way to [inaudible] behave yourself. I remember when you were a drunk[inaudible] three [inaudible] at once. I woulda done a lot of things at once. I'll stay as I am. I told you I'm in a hurry. Speak your mind and then I'll go. Speak your weight if you want, I don't much care. I'm on the run. And what's so funny about that? You're on the run? You won't get far at your age. It's actually serious. I doubt it. Seriously. It's for a good cause, Billy. For God knows [inaudible]. There are some who are still following in your footsteps, Billy. I'll be walking on agood deal of shite, then. I have to go now. No surrender, Billy. No fucking surrender! I surrender. In fact, I give up. Course, uh, I understand why. I mean we all do. Oh, why? I mean it was an [inaudible] shame about that daughter of yours. You know the one I mean? I have three daughters. Aye. But only one of them wentback to Northern Ireland. Made a fool of herself and you. A whirlwind romance. A sudden marriage to a Catholic, Billy. A [inaudible] Catholic. A strong Catholic. One troublesome Catholic. I know. I know, but she's happy. Well, a whole lot of other people aren't. Look, Norman. My father died a pauper in the city. Starved out of our own countryto come and starve here. He had nothing to give me, me da. But he left me three thingswhen he died-- me religion, me politics, and me football team. All true blue, and it's still the same. I still have it all. I will never talk to the Catholic boy. I won't have anything to do with him. But the violence of it all has left me. We have her address, Billy. I can even remember the name of the road without having to refer to my files. See, I told you. I told you I kept in touch. I don't believe you. 14 Lady [inaudible] Road, [inaudible]. What do you want? [laughs] Go on, have a wee drink, Billy. Come on. Look after your car, mister! What for? Because otherwise it won't fucking well be when you get back. I can see you've had a pleasant Christmas, deep in the bosom of your family. You want? - How much? - A quid. Each. On your bike. Here. Happy New Year. Have an accident. Got any ciggies? I don't smoke. You will do when you come out of there. It's death in there. You'll come out crying. All the acts. I'm not an act. Now, go home. Beat it. Kill a midget or something. I know a way you can get in the back way. I'll bet you do. But it'll cost you. BOY 1: Can you hear something? BOY 2: Yeah, me bottle has just fucking broken. No, listen. Aah, I don't know, Digsy. For fuck's sake, this is the fucking pits. I was going to a party. Who were you going with? Clear your fucking conscience. They don't take that at the off-license. New Year's fucking Eve. I've got CSE certificates, you know. Shut up, will you. There's someone coming. All right. No one's going to get hurt. Shit, he's blind. Look, pop. Just give us what you got and we'll go, OK? Let's just fucking go, for fuck's sake. Look, I'm not kidding. Just give us it, OK? - All ri-- - Just give us it. All right. All right. I'll give it to you. Ow, ow, ow. Don't take him, Digsy. He can't [inaudible] if he can't hear you. BOY 2: Fuck off, will you? Don't fucking [inaudible] for that. What was all that about? Why? What's it to you? I just, uh-- I planned to-- nothing. Just, sort of, uh not the normalway of entering a nightclub. He forgot his coat. OK? Friggin' idgit. You'll spend your dying days in Dartmoor Prison. Not at all. I'll be all right. Just lie low for a while and then sleigh it away when they're finished looking for me. Now, we're nearly here. Wait. Hold on, I'm gonna stop here. BILLY: That makes sense-- safe house in the block of pensioner's sluts. Hm. Look, Billy. Look! I've been blown, Billy! I've been blown! They pay good money to informers, nowadays. Shut up, Billy and get hell outta here fast. RON: [inaudible] over here, love. It's getting late. I'm doing my best, Ron? There's no point in doing anything unless you do your best. RON: What did you make the tea for, then? What's the matter with the tea? Oh, nothing, Barb. But, [inaudible] Ron, do you think I'll be all right? Oh, yeah, yeah, great. As long as they set theirlimbo bar to 5 foot 7, eh. Tell me about the fancy dress. Oh, yeah. Well, the first prize is a 10-day cruise for two, [inaudible]. It's not to the WestIndies, by any chance, is it? In some case, SouthernIceland, I shouldn't wonder. Still, 10 days anywhere isbetter than being stuck here. [SINGING] Davy, DavyCrockett, king of the wild-- [knocking] [police shouting] Christ. Oh, my angina. What the friggin' helldo you think you're doing? This is 26. Yeah, and at least [inaudible]someone with a heart condition. [wheezing] I'll have you for this-- Is your name Norman Donahue? You are? I said, is your name Norman Donahue? Is it, shite. He's supposed to be Irish-- I mean, he is Irish. But this is number 26. Yeah, 26 Atley Heights. You are. Atley? Yeah. This is Atley? Yeah. Not Gateschool? No! [COPS MUTTERING] Oh, you've had it for this, you have! You all right, love? We'll get a carpenter straight out. We keep it on standby for these incidents. I'll bet you do.

Anyone listening to you, woman, would think you were deaf. Patton George? It's our own kind tonight. It's the lodge, Martha. Billy's boys. Pennywhistlers and orange [inaudible]. Oh, ey. I hate them more than Help the Aged. Yeah, that's him. I've seen his picture. Are you Greek, or what? No, I've got a sunlamp. Now, open the friggin' door. BILLY: Nowhere left to go, Norman. They should be there. Actually, maybe they're on the run as well, renewing oldfriendships from 40 years ago. That was the last time I saw you, Norman-- 40 years ago in another city. I had nowhere else to go, Billy. So you came here, threatening my family. No. No, I came to you for help. You better come with me, then. What? On a peasant pensioner's aiding? Well, you'll not be out of place, will you? And nobody else wants you, Norman. We can sing all the old songs, anyway. I just want somewhere to go, Billy. Just for the night, even. Look, I'll give thefellas another ring, just to let them know where I'll be. Where will I be? Charleston Club, Stanley Road. And bring a pen, get free bingo. I don't know about no new manager. Yeah, well, you know one now. What happened to McCarthur? He's going. We're doing this weektogether, then he's leaving. He's left. What? Oh, and he's come back. Sort of like these famousrock bands when they split up, you know. And then they come back, if you get me drift. Uh, no, Frank. Not yet. He's given a final performance, and he's going to sing. Ah, I know you're wrong, there. He wouldn't do that. He's got a terrible voice. Are you trying to tell me something? Uh, no. Don't think so, anyway. Look, don't worry about it. You'll find out soon enough. Yeah. I'm really looking forward to it. I thought you might. But in the meantime, justas a matter of interest-- merely to satisfy my curiosity-- you haven't been a passenger ina Mercedes recently have you? Could be, kid. Could be. I've wined and dined with kings, I have. You can tell, can't you? Oh, [inaudible]. There you have it. A Mercedes is nothing special to me. Bernard, here, will attend to you. I've got one or two littleproblems to sort out. You know. Not really, no. Incidentally, Frank, what do you do here? Nothing. I'm a great [inaudible] for delegating, me. Anyway, I'll catch up with you later. See how you manage. You know, not everythinghere meets the eye. Aye, you get them at the door, boss. Usually after 11 o'clock, fullof ale and looking for a fight. They won't look you in the eye either. There's no answer to that. Oh, yeah, yeah, there is, boss. I've got a few up my sleeve. Things like, uh, fuck offbefore I give you brain damage! Of course, of course. I can see you're going to be a constant source of help andencouragement to me, "Ber-ned." "Ber-nard." Ahh.

You're only herebecause it's a free night out, the pair of you. Never see hide nor hair of you otherwise. Where were you on the 12th of July, huh?

I don't get it. That's about par for the course. You're not related to the bouncer are you? If I am, he hasn't told me. What do you manage? To keep alive, just about. Body and soul is another matter. Oh, yeah. And you? What do you do here? I help here. Well, that's no threat tothe Trades Descriptions Act. If you say so. Got to go now. And help? Yeah. I help the chef-- you know, the cook-- and things. And I put the cards on the tables. You know, [inaudible] over 60s club. They don't call them living dead. Singers [inaudible], you know? They have the velvet jackets in them. And the trousers. I just keep me sandwiches in mine. You taking the piss out of me? No, no, it's-- you like singing? Yeah. Singing's the best. No way. We got the Southern Orange Lodge in tonight. I hate the Orange Lodge, do you? We all do now, [inaudible]runs in the family. Well, I know who will begetting fed last tonight. I, uh, enjoyed it. The singing. Yeah? Honest. Oh, that's nice. 'Cause it gets on everyone else's tits. Christ, [inaudible]. [crowd chattering] - I wish you'd seen me. - Oh, no. So do I. Oh, I've been in trainingfor the likes of them, waiting for them, daringthe bastards to make a move. Feel that, go on, feel that. Like rock, that, rock. I ask you, has this body changed, Tony, has it? Well-- You remember this body, don't you, Tony? Course I do, Paddy. Never missed a fight. [inaudible] at 38. Third round, knocked out. Apart from when I was in jail. You know, I felt like Charles Bronson before. Out on the streets of New York. Bloody good, that, pal. What? Your fancy dress, [inaudible]. Oh, it's no fancy dress. [tires screeching] You haven't heard the last of this. You'll never guess what's happened to us! Uh, hey, you. Boss. Can you come here, please. Quickly. Trouble? Uh, not yet. But it's not not trouble,if you know what I mean. Not yet. I know you're new and that, so I rang Frank, but he said it was your compartment. Good old Frank. It's one of the turns, boss. You can call me sir if you want. Well met, [inaudible] boss. Wait until you see these. McCarther must have gone off his fucking cake. [passengers singing] BERNARD: Don't call me bollocks! MICHAEL: Look, lads,first of all, what are you and what exactly are you doing here? We're the band. Not yet, you're not. Have you got a confirmation card? No, but I got my firstholy communion certificate. All right, hey, Macker. Could you do Glenn Miller? You mean fly off in the fog? You'll fucking fly in a minute. MICHAEL: All right, fellas. Now, no offense, Mez, butthere's been a mistake made. There's nothing down for you here. It's as simple as that. There'll be 400 people in here tonight, and every single sodden one of them will have a bus pass and a pension book. They'll want to get legless, have a nice dance, a few laughs, lots of bingo, and sing a song at the end. I'll be honest, is that you? We don't do bingo. Oh, hey, lad, when God gave you teeth, he spoiled a good ass. I'll have two kebab and chips, please, waiter. I'm glad you've come. I haven't seen the tide-mark in ages. I fucking hate bouncers. All right, all right, now, listen. Who booked you in here? I don't know, do I? If you're the manager, you booked us in. Yeah, I'm the manager now, but I wasn't then. I'll have to solve this. Look, we want to play. We want to play. All right, stay here. Tell Frank to be in my office in 10 minutes. Who me? I can't tell f-- Tell him. [passengers singing] The trouble is that when we were kids and we stepped out of line, we got battered. Anyone could batter you then. Not only that, you could batter anyone. We battered the Orange Lodge. They tried to batter us. We both used to batter thechinks and the niggers. And then the police battered the lot of us. But nobody could batteranyone better than I could batter them, and that's a fact. Now, isn't that right, Tony? Oh, you're right there, Paddy. But, nowadays, nobody batters any bugger. Not unless they've got a Stanleyknife and 15 mates or 50 years advantage. Well, nowadays, nobody believes any bugger. Nobody listens to any bugger. And the kids don't give a bugger. There's no values. There's no decency. There's no respect that I can see. One thing I fervently hope and pray is that I put those two littlebastards into intensive care. It's a wig, Winnie. Course it's a bloody wig. He was as bold as a Billyboy at my John's funeral. How can he have hair now? Well, what about hair transport? You mean [inaudible] Well, whoever. Ahh. Look at those poor gits, broken down. Oh, I know. What a shame. On a night like tonight. WARDEN: Do you know what hypothermia is? You mention hypothermia again to me. All I'm saying is can you realize what-- [inaudible] used to be. I'm only the driver. Now, if I'd hit a petrol tanker on the wrong side of the road doing 85 miles an hour, we'd all been burned to boogery-- you might have due course to comment. But otherwise, all as I knowis it won't go, all right? Yes, but I've got sevenold people freezing to death! I'm going to apply the comprehensive emergency procedure as laid down by thefirm for events such as these. And? I'm going to find a phone. You got 10 pence, please? [passengers singing] I'll stay in the toiletswhen we get there, Billy. Just come out to use the phone. Might be a good idea after all. You know, save their number. And who's gonna be lookingfor me with that bunch of-- joofering jizz, would you look at that? [angry shouting] Fucking hell, Billy, he's got a gun. Well, of course he's got a gun. He's supposed to be a cowboy, you soft git. I'll give you memorial! All bloody [inaudible] lot of you! Paddy Burke. Billy McRacken! Billy McRacken! [inaudible] [inaudible] Never left the playground, George. Never left the bloody playground. [angry shouting] Well? Well, you better tell me what's going on. Why? Because I want to know, that's why. It's not a good enough reason, I'm afraid. Sorry. It's good enough for me. Well, I must have higherstandards than you, then. There's nothing going on here that's got anything to do with you. And for that, be grateful. Been lookingeverywhere for you, boss. Excuse me, Frank, but I'd just like to ask boss-- uh, him-- to come outside for a minute. Please. Now. [WHISPER] It's the car park. Hello, Cheryl. [all shouting angrily] [inaudible] Oh, fuck off [inaudible]Billy McRacken? Billy McRacken. [crowd silences] I know you're there. I want you, Billy McRacken. We have unfinishedbusiness, Billy McRacken. Not tonight. I have too much on my mind. No. Tonight, Billy McRacken. Tonight. Not tonight. Nor any other night. [catholics cheer] What are they doing here in fancy dress? Rosco de Ville. And? I don't know what's going on, boss. Honestly, I don't. He was only here a fortnight ago. [inaudible] pity. Died? Died? We had a requiem mass for him. The 12th of July MemorialHall with musical accompaniment. And at least onenotorious, loyalist gunman. Hey, you gentlemen. No musical instruments allowed. By order. The only order Ilisten to is last orders. Well, you listen to these, old son, or you won't get your first order in. Hey, well, you heard the boy. Come on. We're here to enjoy ourselves, that's all. Well, it's a pity we didn't enjoy ourselves in the car park. Put them back. Come on. Back to the coach. Come on. They're coming in. I am not phoning Frank. Evening, ladies and gentlemen. I hope You don't mind me asking, but are you sure you've got the right club? Course we have. What do you think we are, soft? Uh, no, no. It's just that we, uh-- this is the Charleston Club, madam.

But me mom always said that wasthe reason he molested people. Oh, he can molest me any day of the week. What [inaudible] No, him with the mustache. The one that broke your Roger's skull. I've always fancied him. But he was on the wrong side. What's his name again? I only ever knew him as [inaudible]. But do you think they'll go for us? I mean dressed like this? 44 pence, please. Bloody day like robbery. 16 pence each in [inaudible]. Still, great days they were, though. Yeah. Do you think? Oh, aye. Especially for you, Billy boy. King of the castle. Heard you'd got repossessed. Aw, come on, Billy. Don't worry, Billy. There's enough of us here. We'll stand by you. And you beat him last time. Don't forget that. More than anyone else ever did. I want no trouble tonight. But if there is, we'll be there. FRANK: All right, allright, for Christ's sake. Talk to me. Now. Again? Now. [SINGING] Now and again,there are fools such as I. It's "now and then." I know. I was improvising. Look, you. Nobody does that to me! Yeah, well, that's allright because I am nobody. Noted [inaudible]. And nobody should have to put up with this, and therefore, this nobodyis given in his notice as from fucking now. I'm terrible, mate. I don't take no notice. Look, you! Oh, shit. Trouble? Soon. Yeah, you bet. Frank. [man whimpers] Hello, Michael. How goes the night? You didn't mention this in the job description. No. I know I didn't, did I. Yeah, well, you're going tohave to readvertise, Mr. Ross, because, you see, I thought I was going to manage a nightclub, not a friggin' asylum for the violently insane. Frank. I'm not qualified. Oh, yes, you are. Really. [man whimpers] In fact, you're very highly qualified. Let me show you. You see, I do think thatdespite our teething troubles, not to mention Mr. McCarthur's teething troubles-- Goodbye. Oh, you can't go yet. not yet. We haven't had the floor show yet. [mccarthur moans] You see. I told you he was gonna sing. Look, whatever it is, I don't want to know. There you are, Michael. I knew you were the right man for me. Hm? With the perfect attitude-- head down, nose clean, blinkered, and honest, as well as being, perhaps,just a little bit scared. Ah. A fortuneteller. No. Far from it. I am a businessman. I have adopted the principlesof market forces and fear. Try charm at first, by allmeans, but then use terror. [mccarthur pants] Robert, here, will vouch for that. What do you say? Nah, no thanks. This is another world. I don't belong here. ROSS: Course you don't I wouldn't want you to be part of this unpleasantness. I just want you to run my little club for me. Let my questionable money run through you. Don't rob too much off me. Be nice to those withvaricose veins who come here. And don't get too ambitious. Now, Michael, what onEarth can be the problem? Forget it. [QUIETLY] Come on. Hm? You can talk to me. You have to talk to me. You can call me Leonard if you want. Well, apart from discoveringthis little torture chamber, here, I've got a group that can't play music, one bad comedian plus boyfriend,a nervous breakdown calling himself a magician, and two coach loads full of 70-year-old religious maniacs looking for a fight. Oh, yeah, and a fancy dresscontest that no one knew about. First prize-- a 10 days cruise for two. Did you do this, Robert? Did you? [mccarthur moans] You mean, you booked in all this rubbish, and then sent out these foamy,fancy dress invitations-- what-- as a sort of farewell present? Well, booger me sideways, Robert, eh? [inaudible] you will almostgo up in my estimation. Almost. And what happens if I just walk out of here now and disappear? You mean without trace? There's a good boy. Haven't you got that? Oh, yeah. Great thinking. Good thinking, like, you know. Make [inaudible] things equal, wouldn't it. All right. Suppose I'd better goand sorta case the joint. [gasps] And while you're at it, I'll have a [inaudible] over [inaudible]and a double [inaudible]. [groans] What is it? It's all right, Ronny. Tony's getting to me. Are you OK? I'd make an exaction. I want to know exactly where it is. What is it, Barb? My chest is all hot. Yeah, well, I'm not surprised. You're wearing a pair of falseboobs, two tons of makeup, you would have caught abottle of gin in the couch. Is what is all this stupid excitement. There, there. Billy boy! Frickin' Jesus. You know what I've forgotten, Ronny? What? Oh, no, you haven't, have you? What's the matter, Billy? [chicken noises] [SINGING] It's not the leavingof Liverpool that grieves me. I wish I was funny. I wish I thought I was funny. Seriously, though, Michael, don't go. Not now. It would be very foolish to go now. You can get used to threats, you know. That was a promise. Yeah, well, I'll think of something. I doubt it. Don't doubt it. But I do. I mean, you couldn't sell your house in time. And even if you work far away, I wouldn't mind. I like holidays. But I haven't done anything. I know that. But these days, witnesses to the crime are often in as much dangeras those as what to whom the crime was done to. You're all right on one-liners, but you don't [inaudible]fall apart on long sentences. Now, don't be like that. Now when we're just about to be friends. We can be good for each other. We can work together, me and you. Really. Course we can. McCarthur was a fool. Yeah, but you shouldn't get beaten to shit just for being a fool. Ah, but there was more to it than that. You see, he wanted it all forhimself, whereas me and you-- now we understand each other. We can do it quietly and together. Believe me, there's more ways of robbing Mr. Ross than he came up with. Anyway, I'll leave you with that, shall I? Save you having to think of anything. Only, don't stay out too long. You'll catch your death. [SINGING] It's not the leavingof Liverpool doot doo doo doot. So, Mr. [inaudible], I decided to become a comedian after I escapedfrom the Foreign Legion. Hey, listen. If you can get a laugh in French, you can get a laugh anywhere. Did we have an audition night here? Yeah, Tuesdays [inaudible]. I'll put your name downwith all the other dreamers. Oh, and don't hide the cigar. You can have it. Called theft, normally, buthere it's just called normal. Thanks, boss, yeah. I mean-- right, um. Uh, everything all right with Frank? No. But it will be. One way or another. You want to fight, go to the stadium. Now, are youse on or not, lads? Because if you are, I wantthem dancing, not complaining. Can you give us a bit longer? You lot need an eternity. Even that wouldn't be long enough. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Good-- [VOICE CRACKS] goodevening, ladies and gentlemen. Good evening, ladies and-- uh, good evening. Rosco de Ville. Novelty act. I do a bit of everything. I'm a bit worried about me rabbit, which is sort of the highlightof me act, me rabbit. Sod your rabbit. Can you sing country and Western?
