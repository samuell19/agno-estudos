- Curt Devlin Express. - Ok. Hi Curt. I thought I left you in that bird cage at the office. - What's a reporter without his cameraman? - He's happy. I can get a swell picture, I can put it up my sleeve... The last time you did that you got a lovely close-up of your elbow. Now go away and hide someplace and play hermit, will you? Ah Curt, have a heart, I haven't missed one of these clambakes in years. Well, this is one you'll miss. Ok, Ok, I hope when the dame sits down they blow a fuse. It's all I hope. Hey, you better have one, you look pale. I'm all right, what's that on your forehead, dew? Ah, shut up. - What time is it? - 11:35. Well, if this isn't a nice way to make a living. You don't think this Gay dame will take on, do you? Oh, probably, the last one I saw screamed all the way to the chair. That's what I heard about dames, they always dramatize everything. It would've been a good idea if that dame had committed... suicide before she got to the dance hall. - Then we wouldn't have to watch it. - No such luck. I don't know why they give me such assignments, I always get sick. Yeah? And I wish you'd stop eating beforehand. - Never bothers me. - Well, it does me. Hello everybody. And how is everyone on this festive occasion? Hey Devlin, you bring a bottle? Where you've been Dev? Haven't seen you for a long time. - I work for a living. - How are you Devlin? - Well, I'm a dirty so and so. - That's what I always thought. What are you doing here, Garfield? - Covering a story. - Oh thanks. - Have a sandwich? - Not me, I've attended these things before. You mean to say that Spike Kiley handed you out this assignment. - Oh, I asked for it. - You asked for it? Why not? It's a big story, isn't it? Look tidbit, an electrocution is no place for you. - Well, I'm a reporter. - No, you're not. You just a sweet little kid whose... family allowed her to read too many newspaper novels. You make me so mad I could, well, I could... - Spit. - Go ahead. You think you're cute, don't you? You know, I'm surprised you don't talk baby talk. By the way, I don't suppose you've been to any of these high tension parties, have you? Well, there's always a first time. Yeah, but it always seems a little worse when they burn a woman. Why make an exception because she's a woman? Well, it could be a very interesting experience for you. Look, maybe I can give you a rough idea of how it looks. You know, just so you know how to handle yourself. Now, supposing this is the chair. Over there are the witnesses, that's us. Then they slap you in the chair like that, see? Then they put the straps across here, another here and another here. Then another one across here tight. Then they take a wide rubber band and put it across your eyes, like that. And another one across your mouth. Then they take the electrode and they slap it on your leg, like this. - Never mind the rehearsal. - I was only trying to give you a present. - That's a swell way to do it. - Look, real gold and everything. You pick out the most appropriate places to get sentimental. Now listen little Miss Front Page, it's Ok for you to shag fires and ambulances. But a burning is different, it does something to you, it chews you up inside. Look at those guys, they've seen it before, and believe me, they're really tough. No, don't go through it kid, you don't have to. - I'll cover the story for you. - No, you won't. I was sent down here to see it and I'm going to. - Oh, come on, let me take you out of here. - No. - If you can take it, I can. - Alright. Well, I guess it's about time for the slow music. - We can go in now boys. - It's getting close. I don't have to tell you the regulations, you know them. Remember, it's different this time. - Why couldn't they have given her life? - I wish they had. Remember the last time we came through here? I couldn't sleep for a week. Now, you wanted to join the parade, now keep in step. Baby, don't go through it, I'll cover for you. No one will ever know. Tough guy, eh? - Hi, Herb, - Hello, what's the trouble? - Say, did a maniac drive by here doing 80? - No, he didn't drive by, he drove in. And he wasn't doing 80, he was doing 85... and he ain't no maniac, he's Curt Devlin, which is worse. - Is he parked in there? - Yeah. Good, open up. - Hello Burke. - Hi Ned. This is the car, all right. Swallow that tune sonny, let's have your name. - Sure toots O'Grady, press. - Put it away. Before you start writing I should mention I don't own... the car, I wasn't driving and my hands are too cold to sign anything. Then how would you like to put your mittens on and drive this... fire wagon into the station house where it's nice and warm? The trouble with that is I haven't got the keys. Well, in that case you can get out and push it over to the station. Now that we've had our little joke you can write the ticket and I'll be on my way. You said it Toots, come on, get back there and start pushing. - I thought you were playing. - Climb in front. You drive and I whistle. We haven't got all night now, push him up. Would you mind releasing the brake? - You think we should? - Sure, why not? All way up, then. - Step on it, shift her into high. - I've always wanted to travel this way. No noise, no vibration, no nothing. - Goodbye Barnes. - Have a nice time. Where did you pick up the spare tire? - Lovely night for driving, isn't it? - Yes, step on it, let's have a little speed. Did I ever tell you the story about my first wife? - No. - I'm lucky to have my motorcycle. - Hey, what's the matter here? We stopped. - What's the matter with that guy? - Hey toots. - He disappeared. Look. - Hey, are you down there Toots? - I don't know, it's too dark to tell. Well, you better come on out of there or we'll come down after you. Swell, watch out for the first step, it's 25 feet. - You mean you can't get out? - What do you think I am? A bird? Boy, I want to get out of here and get some air. I'm hot and dry all over. Hey, you look pale as a ghost. Hey Mike, get this while it's hot. Believe me, it's hot. I got to go right now, they're waiting. Under my byline. New York, written January 7th. The lights of Broadway did not flicker. But those of North Prison did as... Mabel Gaye bravely sang her last finale. With a song in her lips Mabel Gaye, Broadway's famous female Boniface... At midnight she... - Hey Joe, take care of the kid, will you? - Somebody get her some water. Put her over on the bench and get some water. I don't know whether I can make this, but here goes for a try, are you ready? - I knew that daisy would wilt. - Never mind, I'll cover, pick up my stuff. Be sure and tell the night desk to rewrite it, otherwise we'll both have the same story. - Ok. - Alright, let's go. With a song on her lips Mabel Gaye, Broadway's famous female Boniface... walked to the electric chair last night to expiate the murder of dapper Rudy Spade. As the auburn-haired beauty walked down the last mile... Ok Burt, get that. And the body of the once vibrant toast of the main... stand will be taken today for interment in the family plot... in the little town from where she came, Smithsville, Ohio. Ended. Add this to the night desk. Mike Conley... keep this under your hat, Garfield fainted and I covered. - Give her a break. Curt. - Ok. I feel all right. Thanks. It's ok baby, I covered the story for you. - But... - Now, don't worry, I took care of you. - Thanks you Curt. - I know how you feel, come on. Mabel Gaye died singing, not bad. That gal may make a newspaperman yet. Yeah, she may grow a full beard but that ain't likely either. Here's the Express, final. - Mabel Gaye dies singing. - That's a hot one. Well, for the... Do you see what I see? Well, if you see the same story word for word in both papers, I do. Get circulation and transportation. Hello, Press Room? Kiley talking, hold your run, we're replating page one. - Wait a minute. - Circulation? Kiley, hold the tools stall. Transportation? Hold back your trucks. What? Alright, get back what you can. Three trucks got away already. You know, this bit of female journalism is liable to end us up in a cartoon magazine. You use the AP for the replates and get a sub for the new run. Sorry chief, this came in with Garfield's stuff, I just found it again. Get the telegraph out. Spike, under your hat, Garfield fainted, I covered, give her a break, Curt. Oh, well, I've been here 17 years but I knew it wasn't going to be permanent. Hey, is he quitting? What do you care? You ain't working here anymore. AP? Oh, thanks. Kind afraid around the edges, eh? If you were I would you ask me if I loved you? Well, do you? Sort of? Not sort of, lots of. Would you pucker up and kiss a guy on account of? Just because of. I know a guy that's married. - He likes it. - What is his wife think about it? Well, she wishes he were twins so she could commit bigamy and be twice as happy. Look Curt, what do you think it would be like? Heaven, with all the modern conveniences. Gee, Ellen, why not? This business of being in newspapers won't do, why, that's kids' stuff. - You don't have to work. - No but... Well, I want to prove I can be as good a reporter as... Now look, we could get one of those studio apartments with a fireplace and... and but what else would you want? Are you listening to me? You know, I was just worrying about that story. Alright, don't worry about that, it'll be out on the street by the time we reach town. Don't interrupt me like that again, now where were we? - Read about electrocuted girl. - Extra, morning edition... Hey boy, two of each. Showgirl electrocuted here, read all about it. Girl dies singing here. Mabel Gaye dies singing, Mabel Gaye dies singing. - So you covered me. - That fathead Kiley. Hey, where are you going? - So, you double crossed me. - What do you mean, double crossed? I tried to cover you, wait a minute. This isn't going to do me any good either, you know. - Hey, how you going to get home? - The subway is still running. Not to where you can go as fast as I'm concerned. Nice story, Garfield, both of them. Good morning to you. - Lovely work Sister. - You sure did a swell job with that one. You and that Express guy got a one track mind. Hello. - I'd hoped you'd ended it all. - Did I get you into terrible trouble Spike? What Mr Johns said to me would make mule skinner's... conversation with a factious beast sound like a baby's prayer at twilight. Oh, I'm awful sorry Spike. You only started being sorry. Mr Johns wants to see you. Well, in every life some rain must fall. You're a cloudburst around this office, come on. Do you mind telling me just how it happened that... you and Curt Devlin had the same story word for word? What was it? A coincidence? - Hey Devlin Mr Hartnett wants to see you. - Funny, I had that feeling all morning. And now buttercup, do you mind telling me what this beautiful thing is it... comes into your life and turns you into the Little St Francis of the press? Well, I just wanted to give the belle a break. And while you're giving her a break you give our circulation a compound fracture. It's getting so in use it gets into the Encyclopedia Britannica before we get it. Alright, I said I was sorry and I'm not going to get my eyes all red crying about it. So, what do I do? Go to work for The Star? That wouldn't be any change for you, you're working for The Star half... the time anyway, covering up that sop sister. If you just look on your paycheck... you'd discover that The Express is paying you your salary. Oh yeah, which reminds me... I was thinking about getting married and I thought a raise... A raise? Maybe we better talk about it after the ceremony. A raise? Hello. - Where have you been? - In the sewer. - What? - In a sewer. - What do you doing in a sewer? - Nothing very constructive. Just keeping the rats company. Listen Toots, of all the places for a man to kill time, such as... the movies, the aquarium and the library, you pick a sewer. - It's very indicative of your character. - I knew you'd feel that way about it Curt... but it's just one of those things a man falls into. Think I'd better get home and take a bath, there's been threats. - From whom? - The Board of Health. It's a racket, I tell you, you can't make more than 70 bucks unless you're an editor. You know where the big dough goes, don't you? - It's a swell story, you see what happens. - Hello. Ah, imagine a picture like that, plenty of action, you know my soft focus lens. And where do they put it? - The bottom of the Sunday ads section. - And that's where it should be I... - Hi Devlin. - Oh, hi you Nell. - How's yourself? Toss you for a drink. - Ok, tails. - Two bourbons. - Two bourbons. - What you small boy have? - He can have mine. See you later, you old darling, we picked of you. - Here you are Miss. - Wrap mine up for me, will you? Here sonny, don't forget your drink. - Don't go away, here's mud in your eye. - Make it beauty clay, you need it. Same thing Jill hello Garfield. I thought by this time you'd be out of the newspaper... business and taking a course in Domestic Science. Curt, I found out that you really did try to cover me last night. Ah, you did, eh? I'm sorry. I should've believed you, I know. You think I'm, well, do you think I'm sort of a rat? Well, no, just a little mousy. - You get fired? - No but I got piece of Mr Johns' mind. And I might tell you, it wasn't any present a gentleman should give a lady. What about you? Oh, my boss was quite pleasant, all he said was that he'd appreciate... very much if I would arrange a suicide pact with you. - I guess we're in the doghouse, all right. - Well, don't worry about it. Say, I've been in the doghouse so long I'm commencing to bark at strangers. I'm not worried about you, I'm worried about myself, my job. Oh, in two weeks you'll be back covering the Dahlia Show. - Oh, you going to start that again? - Sure, why don't you marry me? I'll make a swell husband, even if I am a reporter. Now look, I don't write novels or newspaper... plays and take my hat off inside the house, perfect. Don't you forget, I'm a newspaper woman too. Yeah and don't you forget that women make rotten newspapermen. - Is that so? - Yeah. Look at Nell Bonnett. Let me see Nell, if I could make a picture from this angle with my soft focus lens... No, there's nothing you can do. You look at her, she makes me feel effeminate. - Well, I don't, do I? - No. I'm going to prove I'm as good a reporter as any man. Pecans. And what's more, I'm going to make you admit it. Almonds. Oh, I wouldn't marry you for anything in this world. Walnuts, both English and black. - And the muffins I make... - Saved by the bell. That's a three alarm. Well, the son of a gun, he's learned to count. - Aren't you going to cover the fire? - Sure, as soon as I have a glass of beer. - Well, I'm going now. - Say... If it starts to go out, put a little kindling on it you know, so till I get there. You're so smart. - Ellen... - What do you want? You know what happens to girls who play with fire. - What? - Get burned. - Oh, I was under the wrong impression. - It's alright. Fire. Fire in the basement. Fire. Fire in the basement. Stop it, Stone, put that gun down, you don't know what you're doing. - I know just what I'm doing. - Alright, you won't get away with it. Betty get of of here, he's got a gun. Put that gun down, you don't know what you doing. Listen to me, will you please? - Keep out of this. - You don't know what you doing... - Keep out of this. - No, I tell you, no. I'm sorry Miss. But I'm a reporter, this press card says so. I'm not running the risk of letting any woman through these firelands. I don't care if you're a billy-goat, you can't get through. Well, I'd be a billy-goat if you want me to. If you're going to be any kind of a goat, you'll be a nanny goat and you'll like it. - Pardon me. - Let us through folks. - Hello Hallohan. - Make way for mother's little lamb. How are you Mr Devlin? Fine and who's this poor young lady you got with you? - Oh, she says she's a reporter. - She does? Well, she isn't a reporter, and what's more, she never will be. I'm every bit as good a reporter as he is. Oh, yeah, then let's see you get through these lines. There's nothing like an apartment house fire to... find a lot of guys whose wives think they're in Chicago. So keep that bird cage cocked and you'll shoot yourself a scandal. Say, don't worry about me, there's no smoke in my eyes. - Think you can make it? - There's only one way to find out. - Come on. - Take it easy. Officer, can you come here a moment? Hello Mr. Stone, what you doing here? Showing remarkably good sense by leaving a burning building. Will you see if you can get us a cab please. I will Mr Stone. Get back there. Where did she go? She slipped out the back way, nobody saw her. - Are your sure? - I'm positive, stop worrying, will you? Alright, here he comes now. - What's the matter Mr Stone? - Nothing, just a lung full of smoke I guess. - Oh, I hope you're all right. - Thank you officer. Alright. Hey, go back on the curb, back on the curb, go on now. Did you see the Express? I saw both of them. What's the matter with us? - You know any reason why we... - Yeah, here comes the reason now. Good morning Spike. Where have you been and why don't you go back? What's the matter? Didn't you like my story about the fire last night? Oh, that was literature... The hungry flames greedily licked the paint from the building, that moved me and how. The brave fire laddies darting about in the smoke... looked like creatures escaped from Dante's Inferno, that got me too. I don't think my goose pimples will ever go down after that line. It was lovely, so sweet. Well, I'll bet we've given a million readers pimples. You got everything there was to get for the story, read The Express. - Marvin Stone disappears after fire. - Yes. Broadway producer missing after apartment house fire. Well, I'm a... - How you suppose he got that? - By being a newspaperman dear. There are 200 fires in this town every day but there's only one Marvin Stone. So what do you do? You describe a fire. You wouldn't know a story if it picked you on the air and you got lockjaw. If you could only spell I'd put you in the classified ads department. I've had drunken reporters, I've had reporters who couldn't read or write. But so help me, you're the only one I ever had... that can have her throat cut and not know it even after she saw the blood. Oh, I'm sorry, Spike, really I am. You were sorry last time and I was sorry for you last time but no more. To me you're just another dame that's missed her calling. You ought to be writing poems on birthday cards. Oh, give it to me, I know I deserve it, I should've known better. Well, I'm going to start running an office around here. Listen, Stone? Stone, there was a Stone at the fire last night. - Spike, I think I got a beat. - You couldn't beat an egg. - Give me 24 hours, I think I got something. - If I had it my way, I'd give you life. If I don't come back with something this time, I won't come back. I hope. I should've fired her. Wait a minute, wait a minute, hold your horses. Stop that banging or you'll wake the dead. Hello. Say, listen, if you're going to start that goat game... - No, this is important. - So is my sleep. - Have you read the morning paper? - No, I sleep in the daytime. That is, I did until you came into me life. Well Marvin Stone is missing, the police have checked everywhere. Stone, Stone? Oh, I saw him at the fire, I got him a taxi, a yellow. That's what I thought. Well, call them up and find out where they took him. I will. Yeah, now can hold one. Easy now. Alright, hurry up, will you? It's very important. - Give me a chance, give me a chance. - Can't you see it's important? I know, I know, I know. Hello, this is Hallohan, the 5th Precinct. One of your men picked up a gentleman at the Granger Arms Apartments last night at 9:30. Dark coat and a gray fedora hat. Yeah, we want to know where the driver took him. - Ok. - What he say? They're checking up. - Who was the man with him? - Never saw him before. Hello? Yes. Is that so? - Ok, thanks. - Well, what? The driver took Stone to the Plaza Hospital. - Well, come on, let's go. - Not without me pants. - Alright. - Wait a minute now. Take it easy. Stone? Just a minute please and I'll see. Stone, Stone. No, I'm sorry but there's no one here by the name of Stone. Wasn't there any man admitted around 10 o'clock last night? 10 o'clock last night? Yes, there was a man by the name of James Craig admitted at a quarter to ten. Is he still here? - Yes, he's in room 702. - Do you suppose that could be... I don't suppose anything, we'll check up on him. That was room 70... - 702, 7th floor east. - Alright, thanks. Come on. - We'd like to see Mr Craig. - Mr Craig? Just a moment. This gentleman would like to see Mr Craig. Oh, I'm sorry to tell you. Mr Craig died ten minutes ago. - Died? Of what? - A stab wound in the abdomen. - Have you notified the police? - The detectives were with him until he died. - Did he tell them who stabbed him? - No, he never regained consciousness. - I'd like to have a look at the body. - Yes, I'll go with you. - Hold it, hold now, you'd better wait here. - Alright. Thanks. - Well? - It's Marvin Stone alright. My hunch was right, hold on while I call the office. Has anyone else been here and inquired about this man? - No, is she a relative? - No, no, I'm the one interested. I'm just working something out. Hello, give me the desk. Hello, this is Garfield. Spike, spike I've found Marvin Stone. He's dead, looks like murder. Can make it in the bulldog? Murdered, eh? Beautiful, I'll switch you to rewrite. Wait a minute, I just remembered something else. Last night at the fire, Stone turned to the man with him and said where is she? And the mystery man answered, she went out the back way, nobody saw her. A mystery man and a mystery woman and a probable murder. Baby, you're doing swell, now find the mystery woman. Marvin Stone dead of a stab wound, entered hospital under an alias. By Ellen Garfield. It's a thorn in my side when I see you beaten by a woman. She pinned a rose on me alright, you got to hand it to her. Now, don't let her get you down pal. I was one of those lovesick newshounds myself once but it didn't get anywhere. It was purely platonic. She was a blister from Arizona, Indian blood, lots of money and plenty of... Devlin speaking. Oh, the moon of my delight. I wondered if you've been reading The Star lately. Yeah, there was an interesting article about Lydia Pinkham in your last edition. Oh, that yarn of yours. Well, that was just a lucky break. You stumbled over something and it turned out to be a corpse, that's all. I heard a noise distinctly like the crunching of sour grapes. Say, you haven't got a story, all you got is a lead. Real story is digging up the unknown he, the unseen she and the guy who did the foul deed. And that's where I come in in my little quiet way. If I don't beat you to it. Alright, if I turn up this murder, will you give in? Maybe, if you do. - It's a bet. - Crazy. Say, are you serious about this? Ok, it's a bet. It's a bet, read about in the Four Star Mrs Devlin. Have you got any ideas? - Boy... - Yes sir. - Get me all the clippings on Marvin Stone. - Yes sir. Just roll that well enough alone. Alright, next. Alexis Andre, 2000 Grant Avenue. Alexis Andre, 2000 Grant, say, what kind of name is Theodorosa Rosedick? Put it down. I get it, every time we find a name we can't pronounce, that's what we're looking for. Say, as far as I can find out, this fellow Stone is... taken up with every woman in the world except Whistler's mother. You can look up the fellow's life for the\ past ten years only with half of the list. - Got them down? - I got two pages full. Alright, put them in your pocket and come on. Ah Curt, we ain't going to look up all these dames, are we? - You think I'm crazy? - I wish you hadn't asked me that. - Hey Curt. - What? Can we start this with a cup of coffee? I'm one of those pests from The Express. - Could I bother you for a moment? - I suppose so. The late lamented and punctured Mr Stone, know any tasty little details about him? I'm afraid I can't help you. He never regained consciousness and they've taken the body to the morgue. - What about his clothes? - His clothes are here. But I'm afraid they won't give you any clues. The police removed everything from the pockets. Well, nothing will give you less information than a vacant suit. But I would like to see them if I may. - Well, it's not regulation. - Ah, just a little peek. Alright, just a moment. - Come along, no smoking please. - I know, I was just practicing. This way gentlemen, right over here. Here it is. Nice material, isn't it? He'd toast marshmallows on the candles around the coffin. Oh, perfume. Can you imagine a guy spicing himself with a vibrant smell like that? - That isn't a man's scent. - You're telling me? Well, thanks. Say Toots, it might be a good idea to take a picture of her. Make nice human interest story, you know, the modern Florence Nightingale. - Well, really... - Oh, come on. - Yeah, right over here, now. - Yeah, this is where, right up here. Let's see, what, what color your eyes? - Blue. - Both of them? No, no, not the down position, the up position. Oh, thrills me. Now try to look like a cross between an angel and an ambulance going to a wreck. You can't fool me, you posed before. You're so relaxed, hold it. A beautiful subject. May I have one of the pictures? When you see it in the paper, just cut it out. Say, it's above the roof garden, you're in a hurry. Goodbye. - Yes gentlemen, what can I do for you? - Is Mr Stone ever have any suits made here? No sir. Well, did you ever do any pressing and cleaning for Mr Stone... before he shed this mortal coil. - Before he what? - Before he kicked the bucket. Oh yes, I did. Several times. - I was quite shocked... - Yes, I'm sure you were. Do you recognize this piece of material? Oh yes, quite well. It's off Mr Stone's suit. - I cleaned it the day Mr Stone was... - You did, eh? What time did you bring it to Mr Stone's apartment? I took it up to him myself at 8 o'clock that night. - The night he was stabbed? - Yes sir. At 8 o'clock and the fire was at 9. Yes sir, are you? Are you a detective sir? I'm beginning to think so, much obliged, come on Toots. Well, would it be violating a confidence to ask you to tell me what we're doing? Smelling out a murder. Come on. I want to apologize for being so insistent upon seeing Mr Chinard. But I'm hot on the trail of something and I need an educated smeller to help me out. It's quite all right Monsieur. How can I be of service to you? Well, will you take a sniff of this and tell me what you can about the perfume? It's a very fine, expensive perfume. Not a standard brand, it's an individual creation. Very feminine. - Did you blend it? - No. But whoever did is a very fine perfumer. It's heavy without being soggy, it has a distinct personality. In other words, it might've been blended... to reflect the personality of the woman wearing it. Undoubtedly. - What sort of woman? - Naturally, I cannot be certain. But it's the kind of perfume I would blend for very dark, decidedly Latin type. That's the clue, dark, Latin type. Of course I cannot be certain about the Latin type. But I know the woman for whom this was made is a decided brunette. Well, thank you Mr Chinard, I can't tell you how much I... appreciate you sticking your nose into my business. Not at all. Well, I'll be on my way sniffing and barking after this dark, Latin type Elisa. When I get her on ice, I'll guarantee you... a feature story that won't do your business any harm. - Mille fois, merci, Cher monsieur. - Thank you very much. - Where to now? - Hold your horses till I find out. You look like a canary who swallowed the cat for an owl. Why not? I just found out the mysterious she was with Stone the night he was stabbed. - For the love of Mike, who told you? - Who told me? Look... The tailor cleaned that suit and brought it to Stone's apartment at 8 o'clock, didn't he? Yeah. Coming from the cleaner's it couldn't have smelled of perfume, could it? No. The perfume permeated the clothes between 8 and 9. He was stabbed between 8 and 9 so the woman must've been with him, right? Right. How can I photograph a smell? Well, some of your pictures have come pretty close. - Oh, is that so? - Yeah, give me that list of women. Here. Here, you take one of them. Go through the list and pick out all the French, Italian and Spanish names. Could you use a Swede? - No. - Too bad, there's one here. I got one, Inez Cordoza. I got one, Florabelle Martelli, we'll try her first. - Hey, straight ahead. - Right. Lovely day or am I wrong? Are you Miss Florabelle Martelli? Oh, me no understand, je Ne comprend pas. - Say oui and see what happens. - Mademoiselle, est you Florabelle Martelli? - Savvy, you know? Florabelle Martelli? - Oh, one moment Monsieur. Bill. What's the matter Sug? There's a couple of slugs here trying to put the B on me. Oh, yeah? That's the first ape I ever saw with a shave. - What's it all about? - What's it all about? Say, you tell him what's it all about. Well, if we're going to buy the building, we ought to find out who lives here. Oh, that's good, that's very good, nice seeing you. Get out of here. You're alright doll, I saved you. Well, that takes care of number one. Here we are, 306, Brenshow. - This is what? - 306, Brenshow. Good day Madame. - Is Miss Conchita Ranal at home? - Who are you? - We're friends of Miss Ranal. - Oh, is that so? Well, maybe you'll pay me the 40 bucks she owed... when she scrammed to Hollywood last week. We don't know her that well. That takes care of number two, Brookhaven Apartments.. No sir, I'm very sorry, there's no bookmaker here. - This must be the place. - Yes sir? Pardon me, I'd like to talk with Miss Marie Dacosta. Miss Dacosta? Why, she's been dead seven months. - A perfect alibi. - We don't want to see her then. - No, that takes care of number three. - That's right. Come on. Now listen Joe, just because I go out with you socially is no... sign I'm going to introduce you to my friends and that's that. I beg your pardon... - Forget it. - It's forgot. - Say, we're looking for some information... - Do you know... No. Say, I didn't get in till 6 A. M. So what do I do? I turn up my eyes and hop into a new dress and I'm all right. - How do you feel? - Terrible but I get Ok. Say, I wonder if either of you two sis could tell me if Miss Inez Cordoza is about. Oh, Inez left the show about a month ago. - And where is she now? - She moved. I know that because I called her this morning... to get the dope about her boyfriend's murder. - They said she left. - Oh, Stone was her little playmate, eh? Say, what are you? A detective? Ah, with a pleasant face like mine and dainty little feet like that? No sister, I'm just a reporter trying to gather a few morsels on the Stone case. And if you girls can contribute any, I'll pay off with some good publicity. Oh, well, I'm Mae LaRue, M - A - E. - Put that down too. - Ok. My name is Olive Wilson. - Got that too? - Got it, got it bad. Now my beauties, tell me all you know about our little Inez. Well, we don't know much, except Stone was awfully crazy about her. She was for him too, that is until Coulter came along. Coulter? You know Maitland Coulter, the big-shot polo player. You'd think he just got out of the Navy, the way he went for her. Well, I can't tell you how much good this does an old man's heart. By the way, Inez didn't leave an addresses or handkerchiefs behind her, did she? No, she took everything, Inez was like that. Oh, she left a slip hanging on the rack in my dressing room. - But I don't see what good that do you. - Well, get it for me, will you? Sure. - Did you see Mr Stone after he was dead? - Well yeah but not to speak to. Was there much blood? - How high was the blood Toots? - Oh, up to my knees but then I'm a tall man. Gee, I don't see how you reporters stand it. Well, we usually wear boots. - Here it is. - Thanks. Hold it. Give it to me, the mysterious she is Miss Cordoza Toots. Thanks girls, be seeing you in the press. I'll fix you up a nice picture with my soft focus lens. I wish I had Inez in that slip, I could get a lot of good angles. Hello, give me Mack. Mack? It's Curt. Hold the four star for a stop press. And get me a photograph of Inez Cordoza and Maitland Coulter. Yeah, get them at the morgue and send them down to Central. Have I got something? Say listen, I've got a story that will curl the hair on an eggplant. Sorry, you just have to sit there and munch your nails for another half hour. Yeah and then I'll be along with her, so long. - Hi Mr Devlin. - Hello Bill. - Here the photographs you sent for. - Thanks. - Well, how is the future Mrs Devlin? - Fine, how is the disappointed bridegroom? - Oh, aimless, just aimless. - You don't need me for a minute, do you? - No. - That's what I thought. - Have you seen the Lieutenant? Anything new? - Not much. I can save you a trip in there though. They found an automatic in the apartment but no knife. The gun hadn't been fired. The houseboy testified that someone is been in the... apartment about 8:30 just before the fire. I suppose you made some startling discoveries. No, I'm afraid you'll have to marry me out of love and not defeat. Maybe but not till you admit I'm as good a newspaperman as you are. No, let's call it a draw right now and not talk about it anymore. No, I made a bet with you on this Stone case and if you back out now you're a welcher. Will you have dinner with me tonight? Meet you at the room around seven. Listen, well I meet you at your room at seven. - Bye. - Bye. Well, by God, a monkey in a zoo has more privacy than I have. - Hi Chief. - Hi Lieutenant. Well Devlin, what do you want? Say, is the negro houseboy and that flatfoot Hallohan around... who saw the mystery man run out of the fire? - Yeah. - Well, get them in. Say, you want to put on my uniform too? Hello, send Hollahan and that Johnson boy in here. Well? A girl by the name of Inez Cordoza... and Maitland Coulter were with Stone the night he was stabbed. Coulter and Stone had been quarreling over the girl, the girl is disappeared. Say, this one of your flights of fancy or are you talking turkey? Well, if Hallohan and Johnson can identify this picture, I can prove everything. Well, if they can you've saved me an awful headache. - If they can't, I'll give you one. - Here you are Lieutenant. Yeah. Stand right there and look at this, who's this? That's the fellow I saw with Stone the night of the fire. - What about you? - I don't know his name but I've seen him. That's the man that asked for the number of Mr Stone's apartment the night of the fire. That's just what I thought. - Hold him, I want to talk to him. - Alright, come on. - Lieutenant, is a pleasure to see you work. - Thank you. Give me the Homicide Bureau. Mike Mike, pick up Coulter, suspicion of murder. Yeah, Stone. Wait a minute... See if you can find a dame by the name of Inez Cordoza, same charge. - I haven't got a picture of her. - Yes, you have. Wait a minute. I was wrong, I have got a picture of her, Curt Devlin just gave it to me. I'll send it right over. Now you got to do me a favor. Well, I'll buy you a drink but I won't read your darned Express. I want you to keep this mum until I get the story on the street. Yeah. Look in your pocket and see if you can find Inez. I'll look in my other suit, so long. I repeat Lieutenant, smooth work, smooth work. Well, thank you. When this edition gets on the street every editor in town... will be picking up his pencil and sneaking out the back door. - Do I get a bonus? - Sure you do. - How much? - Oh, don't be mercenary. Besides, that's not my department. Well, do what you can, every little bit counts, know, I got a date. - With that savvy over The Star? - Yeap. Now, don't tell her anything, will you please not? This is one time she won't get anything out of me. That was what Samson said the night before the woke up without his hair. Oh well, so long. - Hi. - Hello. - Two more. - Yes sir. - Gee, I like you. - I'm sort of fond of you too. I don't know why, maybe it's because you remind me of an Irish Terrier I once had. - Smart dogs, Irish terriers. - Oh, this one wasn't, he bit me. All of which goes to prove that us Irish terriers will stand just so much. Which reminds me to tell you that you're all through playing newspaper. You going to get off that sheet and marry me. That's right, when you admit I'm as good a reporter as you are. Hey listen, I'm sick and tired of humoring you. You're not a reporter and you never have been. You're just another dame hanging around a newspaper office getting in people's way. In fact, you don't even know when you've been taken to the cleaner's. - So that's what you think of me. - Yeah. Read that. - Alright, you win. - Where you going? You forgot to find Inez Cordoza, suppose I'll have to do it for you. To women. They're what gods are to science, a pain in the neck. So I said, cold but ladylike I said Mr Trumbull, if you're trying to gild this... lily, this lily is going to put her shoes on and kick you right in the teeth. Come in, we're decent. - How do you do? - We do all right. - I'm Ellen Garfield, of The Star. - Another one, you're the seventh. - Could you give me some information about... - Oh, we know, Inez Cordoza. - Let's go into the routine Mae. - We don't know where she is. - She moved when we called. - Coulter and Stone had a fight over her. - And all that she left here was a slip. - A slip? May I see it? - Sure. - Dig up the slip Mae. - Say, I'm getting a sore arm doing this. - Thanks. Of all the slips Inez made since she was... sixteen that's the first one you reporters have given any attention. No, this is going to be a help. - What you going to do? - Copy the laundry mark. How do you like that? Copy your laundry mark, eh? That just goes to show you what publicity will do for you. Before Stone was dead she could've been tattooed and nobody would've copied it. Hi-ho. I found out that the police have a record of every laundry mark in the country. So it wasn't very difficult. Yes Miss Garfield, this is one of our laundry marks and you're very fortunate. It's a rush job and it's to be called for today. The perfect definition of a lucky break. - Would you do me a favor? - Certainly. - Do you suppose we could arrange a signal? - Now let me think. What can we do? Wait for me, I'll be right out. Hey, wake up. - Rip Van Winkle, wake up. - What's the matter? Yes ma'am. See that taxi over in front of the French laundry? - Yes ma'am. - Oh, when he pulls out, you follow him. And it's 10 dollars in it for you if you don't lose him. For 10 bucks I'd follow a cow on a Ferris Wheel. Now get ready, here he comes. 48, Kingston. Hey buddy... Don't know whether you care or not, but the hack back there is been following us for the past eight blocks or more. Can you make out who's in it? Not sure, this mirror is pretty bad, looks like a girl. Want me to lose him? No, pay no attention and go to the address I gave you. Say, I could lose him so fast they'd think we vanished. Mind your own business and go where I told you. Ok, customer is always right. Say, what is this? A game of follow the leader? What are you talking about? We're following the guy ahead and there's a guy following us. Oh well, it couldn't be who I think it is or he would be in front of us. - I hope you got a permit for this prey. - I got everything but a police escort. You know Toots, women hand me a laugh. Now, you take my little Ellen up there. She thinks she's putting one over on me. Yeah, cute little Ellen broke that Stone in the hospital story over you like an egg. I always say you never see the blood until your throat is cut. Say Miss, you want me to shake that guy behind? Shake him? If who I think it is, I'd like to shred hem. But it's more important that you follow the car in front of us. You wait here. Hey buddy, you can't park here, you know better than that. - We know it, press. - That's all I got, move it Joe. - Inez, Inez. - Yes? - Robert, what is it? What's the matter? - Oh, nothing, I just hurried, that's all. What? Oh, I just dropped in for a minute I, I can't stay, really. Oh yes you can, get in there. Oh please, don't point that. - Robert, who is she? - She's a fly cop sis. - You got me all wrong. - No, I haven't. Now you sit tight and keep your mouth shut or you'll go back to headquarters on a slab. I'm not a cop, I'm a reporter, you got to believe me. I'm the only one that knows you're here. Won't you tell me your side of the story? - I haven't any story and I'm not guilty. - Then let me tell them if you're not guilty. Don't you realize every day your story goes untold... the more people are convinced that you did kill Marvin Stone? You're just wasting your breath. - Can't you see I'm trying to help her? - Yes, you'll help her to the pen. - Won't you believe me? - Shut up, if you know what's good for you. Sis, if the newspapers are after you... can't wait until tomorrow, you got to leave tonight. What about the tickets? Now, don't worry about them, I think I can get you out on a... fruit boat, here's your things, start packing. - Alright, I'll pack. - Right away. And you going to stay locked up here with me until she's... outside of the limit and well under way. - You get it? - Yeah. Let's go. - So Inez is your sister. - Yeah, what did you think? Well, if she is your sister, why don't you let me help her? I told you to shut up. - That's right, you did, didn't you? - Yeah. If it's not going too far, could a lady ask for a cigarette? - On the desk. - Thanks. Hello, Pier 108? Get me Mr Moorehead. - Inez has good taste. - What? - I mean, mean I like the place. - Get away from that window. You're just trying to fast talk her into walking into something... so you can get a story or make a pinch, whatever it is. Hello Phil? This is Bob Cordoza. Listen Phil, you've got a fruit boat leaving tonight, haven't you? Well, I want you do me a favor. Yeah, I want you to take someone with you. The curtain quick, it'll set the whole place on fire. What? Wait a minute, wait a minute, I'll call you back. What's happened? What's the matter? - Quick. - Alright. - Alright, don't get excited... - How did it start? - Robert? - Oh, I guess it was that... Now both of you stay where you are and do as I say. You going to tell me your story whether you like it or not. But I'm innocent, I tell you. Well, if you are, you're certainly playing it as if you were guilty. If you are, with this I can clear you in spite of yourself, I'm not kidding. This story means a lot more to me than just a newspaper story. Well sis, I guess we got to play ball with her, there's nothing else we can do. - What time is that fruit boat leave? - In about 45 minutes. Say, are you sure this Cordoza dame is coming down here? Positive, I got the story all set up. As soon as Toots gets a picture of you making the arrest... I'll get the plates in and be on the street in half an hour. Now, watch out for her boys and keep out of sight. Say, you going to leave that gal of yours up in that... flat looking down the barrel of a gun all night? You're darn right. I'm going to teach the future Mrs Curt Devlin once and... for all that a woman's place is in the home. This story is going to make you look awful bad. Say listen, after tonight if anybody rattles a... newspaper at her she'll run screaming from the room. - Yeah, after you with a butcher knife. - No, not her, she's a good sport. You know, we made a deal that if I topped her in this story... there'd be a wedding. Say, how you like to be best man? Well, I don't know what else I could be, I'm too old for a flower girl. - Here she comes. - Get out of sight. What I tell you? - Boy, you ought to be a crystal gazer. - Wouldn't he look that in a turban? Get set. - Use a match. - No thanks, you don't smoke. There she is boys, come on. Bring her up the stairs. Turn around so I can get a shot. - You're under arrest. - Take it easy now. Wait a moment till I get a statement. Well, I'm a dirty so and so. Statement gentlemen? Why, certainly. You may quote me as saying that Mr Curt Devlin... is put the long arm of the law on a sling. Miss Inez Cordoza was discovered... by The Star representative and she will introduce her to the DA in the morning. To further substantiate my statement, you may read... her exclusive interview in the latest edition of The Star. Reporter finds Inez Cordoza. So a woman's place is in the home, is it? - Ah, the wrong dame, eh? - And I was set for a big surprise. You got set and he got surprised, worked out a little differently, that's all. The life is like that. Was a grand job and I'm proud of you. Well, I'm not. I feel as though I played sort of a dirty trick on you. Ah, forget it, it's a tricky business tidbit and you did all right. You're swell Curt. - Gee, I'm crazy about you. - Honest? Honest and I'm going to cut your throat. Don't forget what went on under your chin tonight. - Just luck. - Oh, so when I do the top thing it's luck. But when you do it, it's because you're a topnotch reporter, eh? When you going to marry me? When you top me on this story, which means I'll probably die an old maid. Now listen, if Miss Cordoza wants to give you stories or pictures, that's her business. But you've got to wait. - Thanks Joe. - Ok Miss Garfield. Now listen, when the DA questions you just... as you were all the other witnesses today tell him the truth. There's no use trying to protect Coulton because you don't know anything. The most important thing to do is take care of yourself. I suppose so. Anyway, I'll do as you say. - You've been awfully kind Miss Garfield. - Don't worry, it's not entirely unselfish. I want this to be an exclusive story. Promise me you won't say anything to those news belchers out there? Alright. The story is mine and I mean to keep it that way. Will you step in now Miss Cordoza? I'm sorry, I can't let you in on this, you'll have to wait out here. Oh, I can't stand it. - Miss Cordoza Mr Devlin. - How you do? Sit down, won't you please? The a cigar in the humidor Curt, help yourself. - Thanks. - Thanks. Now Miss Cordoza, I want to know just what happened on the night Stone was murdered. You're on the Coulter case, aren't you matron? - Yes. - Will you come in, we'll fix up your card? Listen Joe, you got to do me a favor. - Take me in that room with you. - You're out of your mind. - You know I can't do that. - Oh but Joe, is matter of life or death. Newspapermen are bad enough, but newspaperwomen... - Listen, I'm out for promotion. - You're talking to just the right girl. I got a friend that will fix it up with Chief Nelson. You'll have gold stripes in your sleeve in a month. - I can't do it. - Oh, just got to, that's all there is to it. And then? Go on. Well, I went to Mr Stone's apartment for dinner. When I arrived Mr Coulter was there and Mr Stone was ill. The room was in disorder and there were signs that there had been a struggle. I asked questions but they passed them off by... saying Mr Stone had been ill all day and he'd been drinking. He often drank too much and he had a violent temper so I said nothing more about it. Stone seemed to be suffering a lot but he wouldn't let us call a doctor. He said he'd be all right and while we were arguing fire broke out. Naturally we got out of the building and Coulter put Stone into a taxi. - That's all I know, everything, I swear. - Why didn't you come here at once? - I was afraid Coulter might be drawn in. - He's in all right, up to his neck. But he's innocent, I tell you. Innocent, don't you see that he is? Please Miss Cordoza, no hysterics, you may go now. The matron will stay with you until the trial is over. - Send in that Japanese houseboy, will you? - Yes sir. George, will you help Miss Cordoza through that line of reporters? - With pleasure. - Thank you. - This way Miss Cordoza. - Hold it, thank you Miss Cordoza. - A beautiful soft-focus picture. - Have no idea you being in here. Matron, take care of Miss Cordoza. Those guys would photograph a hanging. - Well, that didn't help us much. - No. - How you do everybody? - Hello Fuji. Fuji, are you sure you don't remember... seeing a knife the day after the night Mr Stone was stabbed? I no see knife. Even when I remember with my imagination. Tell me exactly what you did... the morning after the fire when you came into Mr Stone's apartment. Women? Be quiet, I don't want to miss a word of his testimony. First I open door. Then I say, tsk, tsk. When I think Mr Stone has been drunk again. Then I reach down, pick up mail on the door. Go to kitchen to cut open the envelope... both side and top like Mr Stone like envelope cut when he read in the morning. Then I did notice sand, ash and blood in pieces on floor, I get the vacuum and suck up, then I get the breakfast... Put it and letters on tray... and knock on Mr Stone's sleeping door. He no answer. I open. He no in bed. I sit. Pretty soon boys come said Mr Stone he shot in his stomach with knife. Alright Fuji. That's all, thank you very much. Thank you, thank you very too much. Thank you, thank you very too much. We're in for it. We can indict Coulter, he's laying out. But we're going to have the devil's own time convicting him. - Why, it looks like an open and shut case. - Open and shut, my hat. Stone was stabbed and the jury is going to want to know with what. A man who brings a gun to commit a murder doesn't bring a knife too. A man who thinks to bring a knife... wouldn't forget and leave his gun in the middle of the floor. To build this case, we've got to have exhibit A. The instrument with which the murder was committed and we haven't got it. And if you don't find it, the defense will nail your hide to the courtroom door. If there's anything I can do, you'll let me know, won't you? Thanks. I'll see you later Devlin. Why hello Miss Garfield, you know Mr Devlin? He's helping us with this case. And thanks for your cooperation too. Oh, I'm always willing to cooperate. In fact, as you're up for reelection do send me a handful of your campaign buttons... to hold up my little brother's trousers. Cute, isn't she? There you are. You know when you smile like that you look like a very sick cat? Sorry tidbit but I seem to be able to get in everywhere. So can a Jersey mosquito, but they make better company. You're wrong tidbit. Sorry I couldn't include you in that conference but you know... Oh, don't you worry about me. I don't think I missed very much. Well, you never can tell. What are The Star's views? Well, we think that the DA is going to have a very hard... time getting a conviction without that knife. Yeah. That and the fact that Inez testified Stone was ill when... she got there suggests a third party and a reasonable doubt. Which I have a hunch the jury will give him the benefit of. Very good but how... Well, I guess the longer you're associated with me the smarter you get. - By contrast... - Yeah, listen... Yeah, listen, I was going to cut you in on something but... Oh, that sounds like bacon for some other sucker, not me. Well, it sounds like a crazy hunch but... supposing that knife is still in Stone's department. Oh but they've been over it with a fine tooth comb. Yeah but you know, a cop's idea of a fine tooth comb is a rake. - Sounds crazy, I know... - Oh but you can't be serious. There isn't a chance they overlook a thing like that. Yeah, I guess you're right. - Just another good hunch gone wrong. - Yes. Say, I got the car I... - Next car please. - Oh, I'm sorry, I can't ask you in. I popped her just she came out. What a picture, one of those Toots... - specials, never saw anything like it... - Pardon me. Could you tell us where the Marriage License Bureau is? - Ask him. - Pardon me, could you tell... A scissors but no knife. Fuji said when he came in here that morning he went out to... the kitchen to get a knife to open the mail. Why? Because the paper knife was missing. Stone was stabbed with a paper knife that was supposed to fit in here. That's why we're opening this bronze bagpipe? Exactly, go ahead and open it. Fuji said he used that thing to clean up the morning after the murder. It looks like you're out of luck unless I can interested you in some sand. Sand? Say, how you suppose that got in there? Maybe Fuji used this clean the spillage. If he uses that thing to clean up here, he probably use it to clean up in the hall also. Come on. And I never get a break, how you going to photograph a missing knife? Anybody that can get in places as easy as... you can couldn't possible have come of honest parents. I should argue with the superintendent. Come on, grab this and let's take it inside. What we going to do now? Play in the sand? If I'd known of this, I'd brought along a bucket and a spade. There, let's dump it here. Reminds me the beach I went to one Sunday. Ok. Now, let's see. There she is, for the love of Mike. This innocuous little instrument my friend, will give the... DA a thrill and Mr Coulter the shock of his life. Some shock, about 2,000 volts. I can feel us going up for burglary, this is plain. Well, fancy seeing you here. Well, I was just passing by, I knew you'd be here. - Yeah? - Yeah. By the way, the next time you pick a lock... please remember to take out the hairpin, it looks neater. You might've left some fingerprints. Oh, I see you've been house cleaning. - You find the knife? - No tidbit. If there's a knife in this apartment it would take Lady Macbeth to find it. I told you so, just another good hunch gone wrong. Well, that only goes to prove we can't have everything. Couldn't we get out of here before we have to... explain something to somebody who might be disagreeable about something? That boy is a very good idea. - Say, will you tell me how you got in here? - Not with a hairpin. Good morning. - Good Morning big hearted. - Little feverish this morning? After you cut me in on that story yesterday? Oh, no. Well, if you were half the newspaperman you... thought you were yesterday, you'd have the same story I did today. Why don't you build yourself a statue and hold services every Sunday? Say, are you sure you're going to marry that dame? - Positive. - I don't think she is. Here ye, here ye, this court is now in session. On the night of the fatal stabbing... Coulter called upon the deceased and quarreled with him. Hence, we have opportunity. Coulter, a man who never before had been known to carry a revolver... carried one that night. Because gentlemen, there was murder in his heart. True, Stone was not shot, he was stabbed, by a paper knife within easy reach on a table. Swell angle. The next day the gun was found on the floor. The room gave evidence of a struggle... and the paper knife was later found in an ice receptacle. Why? Gentlemen, because this is what happened. There was a quarrel, Coulter drew his revolver... in the struggle Stone knocked it from his hand to the floor, then Coulter... snatched the paper knife from the table and plunged it into the man he hated... to commit the crime for which he came. Murder gentlemen, premeditated murder. A crime of which the people demand you find him guilty in the first degree. The Court is adjourned. - You think they'll convict him? - Take it easy boys, take it easy. I got some swell stuff Curt, got a pan, that third bank from the right. I got a soft focus angle and this and it's terrific. - Shut up. - Well, I'm just interested in my work. Hey, give me the desk, this is Devlin speaking, get this. As the jury file passed Maitland Coulter's eyes peddled each member for his life... On the face of one he saw pity, on the face of another condemnation. All the rest were enigmatic. What were behind those ten faces? Freedom or the electric chair? And listen... And listen, rewrite that while you're whistling... Hearts and Flowers softly and you'll get the idea, so long. Have the doors closed behind the jury? Period, paragraph. Come on, I got something on my mind. There are two ps in opportunity. Some day I'm going to buy a flit gun and shoot you dead. I think I'll cut you in on something. The way you did yesterday? No, thanks. - Sure? - Positive. Ok. Hey Toots, ask your camera to come along and bring you. - We may need a tripod. - Funny, eh? Better come along, I'm sure I got something in the bag. I know that bag, I held it yesterday. - Close the door. - What game we playing now? Broom closet, that's it. Something tells me this the beginning of something is going to end up in trouble. Come on, let's beat it. - Say, what the... - You stay here and try to look nonchalant. - Guilty. - Guilty. - Not guilty. - Guilty. - Not guilty. - Not guilty. - Not guilty. - Not guilty. Guilty. - Guilty. - Guilty. - Guilty. - Seven to five. Gentlemen, we now stand 7 guilty, 5 not guilty. He's guilty. The judge said if there was a reasonable doubt... Reasonable doubt? There's no doubt in my mind but that he's guilty. He was there. The night. The gun. Now listen. I won't be influenced gentlemen, I'm trying to do the right thing. - Wait a minute, who are you? - The janitor. Just what I've been looking for. What a man? What a man? The most interesting profile I've ever seen. I'll put your picture in the Sunday papers. The Man Behind the Broom. - Hold it. - You're going to take my picture? - I got it, you want to take a nip? - Sure, thank you. - Skol. - Hold it, no, no, the light's bad in here. Let's go out in the fire escape where there's a beautiful background. - The stars, the moon... - But it is dark out there. All the better. If that jury don't come in soon they'll forget what they went out for. Maybe they've escaped. Somebody ought to go and find out. If that fathead Devlin hadn't dug that knife up... the jury would've brought in the verdict not guilty, we'd all be home in bed by now. Ah, give him a break, maybe the guy ain't guilty. This is Hedley. No, they're still out. Yeah, just a minute. Oh Garfield, that nice man you work for is on the phone. Thanks. Hello Spike. What? How could he? He's not a mind reader. Sure, I'm watching. I don't know. Ok. - Well, I'm a... - What's the matter babe? Devlin cracked the story his two star... the jury on the ninth ballot stands ten to two for conviction. Oh, he's crazy. Sure, there's no way he could find out. That guy is going to get himself in a sling crack with those fake stories. - How would he dare do a thing like that? - That guy would dare anything. - Guilty, guilty, not guilty, guilty. - Eleven to one. Gentlemen, we now stand eleven guilty, one not guilty. - Can't you see? - No. For the love of Pete, are you going to hang out forever? I'm doing my duty as I see it, I don't want to convict the man unless I'm sure. Now remember, you're a man of moods, this time you're dramatic. Hold it. This time you're happy, hold it. Come in. - Well, well? - They still out sir. Then I'll go across the street and get a bowl of soup. I'd be glad to get it for you Your Honor. Oh no thanks, I need a breath of fresh air myself. And you let me know if those fellows make up their minds. Yes sir. - Do you realize how long we've been here? - Yes, will you please come on popcorn. - You can't hold out forever. - Alright alright, have it your way. We can't stay here all night, I vote guilty. Come on boys, let's take a final vote. Hello desk? Devlin. Hey, you can go to town. Yeah. Coulter is guilty. Yeah. Give me a rewrite man. Thanks. Ok. - They just went in. - Good. Come on, I got an idea. Hey, what we doing now? Find a waste basket and put all those ballots in it. - What for? - Manufacturing a news piece for Garfield. - Oh, phony ballots, eh? - Yeah. Leave the door open. Now act mysterious and don't notice anything. Now you take the old Egyptian tapestries, the weave is what mattered. Unlike the modern artist, the old masters always took their time. Not guilty, not guilty, three... - Say, what's going on here? - Now, that's exercise number one. Number two, keep the right leg stiff and walk. Seven, twelve. Not guilty. Hello. Give me the desk. Hurry, it's Garfield. - Hello Spike, it's not guilty. - What's that? It's not guilty, I tell you, the jury is just filed in to give the verdict, hurry it up. Please Spike, you want The Express to top us? Ok. Hello? Composing Room? Coulter is not guilty. Beg your pardon sir, the jury is ready to render a verdict. Is that so?

What is your verdict gentlemen? We find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. You two are going to be happy together, I can see that. Yeah... Bailiff, bring that fellow Devlin into my chambers. Yes sir. Beg pardon Devlin, the judge wants to see you. Let me know what the visiting days are. Hello, give me the desk, this is Garfield. Hello Spike? Spike, I steered you wrong, Coulter is guilty. - What? Coulter is guilty? - Well, I'll be a... Why, you. Reprint Page One, Coulter is guilty. Aye sir. Press room, hold your run, Kiley talking. We're going to replate page one. Circulation? Taylor speaking. Hold Page One for a replace. Call Stacey and kill the whole page. Something is happened, stop everything. Hello Henderson, stop the final. We're replating page one. - Don't move a thing until I call you. - Transportation. Hold your trucks.- What? We're on the street with a bum steer. Grab cabs. Buy every Star you see. This is the biggest bloomer that's ever been pulled. There you are. Now start at Larkin St. and pick up every final with a not guilty banner. Grab cabs, now step on it. Remember, here. You fellows over here, start at Larkin Street and work South. Here you are, come on now. All of you. There, step on it. - What's this? - Well, you're quitting, ain't you? Get out of here. Hello. - Oh, it's you. - Spike, I don't know what to say. Well, I do. You're fired. Bye extra paper, read all about it. Star, Coulter not guilty. - Give that to me. - Hey, what you trying to do? Alright son, I'll pay you for these. Here, here's a buck for you. Ok, thanks a lot. Sorry, all sold out. Is this the latest edition of The Star? I'll buy the whole bunch. Come on boys, clean up. - What happened? - Never mind. It's all right Spike. If there's one more copy of The Star left on the street... I'll eat it. Extra, extra, Star Paper. Coulter not guilty, extra. Extra, Coulter not guilty, extra. - Here you are. - Thanks. Here's your change Miss, I took out for all three. - Ok, keep it. - Thank you. Waiter, bring me an old fashioned, will you? And hurry up. - Make it two. - Oh hello. - Hello. - Two old fashioned Joe. You mind if I join you? I'd like to get drunk too. No, I don't mind. - I'm sorry for you Inez, tough, I know. - They're so wrong, he didn't do it. - Well, buck up. - What have I to buck up about? He didn't do it, I tell you, he didn't do it. Well, all right, all right, so what? - Waiter? - Yes miss? Waiter, bring us two more old fashioned to the table over there. - Yes Miss. - Come on. Let's sit down, it's awfully uncomfortable here. - Ok. - Two more old fashioned Joe. The Express won't assume any responsibility. You brought this down on yourself, now let's see you get out of it. I wash my hands of the whole matter and so does The Express. Great work kid, congrats. Now, don't worry, we'll spring you. And there's another raise in this for you. - Yeah? - Sure. Mr Hartnett, at least you ought to get me a lawyer. Get your own lawyer. Say, you have anything to do with that Lulu that came out in The Star? That lulu was my idea. Good work, you certainly made a sap out of that dame. No, she's no sap. In fact, she's the best newspaperman I know and I'll tell you something else. If she gets fired off The Star, you better hire her because if you... Here, here she comes, I'll see you later. - Hello. - Hi. - Well, look who's here. - Aha and look who's in there. I'm sorry to have tripped you up in that yarn. But after all, you should've known better than to fall for that stuff. You needn't rub it in Curt. - I'm all washed up as a newspaperman. - Fired? - Oh, do you really mind? - No, I guess maybe you're right. - It isn't any job for a woman. - Sure, women are bad newspapermen. But not too bad, you lug. I killed Stone, Inez Cordoza. Showgirl, fiancee of Coulter, confesses fatal stabbing. Say, what is... Just after the verdict I ran into her in the Colla's Cafe. She was shot to pieces so I went to work on her, it wasn't very hard to break her down. The story is briefly this, Stone was about to kill Coulter. So Inez stabbed Stone in order to save her sweetheart's life. But the knife, those were men's fingerprints. She had on an evening dress, long black gloves. The minute that Inez stabbed Stone... Coulter grabbed the knife out of her hand, then they heard the fire engines. You'll read the rest in The Star. For the love of Mike. Say, that's the way to work. That's being a good newspaperman. Do you really mean that? - Well, I hate to admit it but I do. - Oh, that's all I wanted to hear you say. Here. Garfield's last stand. Hold it. You can cut out that silly stuff now, I got the picture. Well, that takes care of both papers.
