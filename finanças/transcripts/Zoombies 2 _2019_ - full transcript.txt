[ rattling ] [ man ] All right, people, listen up. We're going in, and we're taking as many animals as we can. Now, there's not a lot of time, so we gotta move quick. Layne? - Yeah? - I want you to take your camera and record everything. We need to show our investors that they're getting their money's worth. [ Layne ] You got it. [ man #2 ] Hey, boss, is Jezel coming with us? - She's gonna parachute in and open the gate for us so we can get in. [ man #2 ] Man, she's crazy. - [ chuckles ] You're telling me. All right, let's load up! - Yes, boss! - Yes, boss! [ parachute rustles ] [ keypad beeps ] - You're late. [ grunts ] [ laughs ] All right, move in. Layne. - Yeah, boss? - You're on inventory. - Copy. - Animal cages? Cable nets? - Check. - Pheromones? Tranquilizer darts? Two pistols and a rifle? - Check and check. - Use those sparingly. - Nobody wants a tiger hide full of bullet holes. All right, people. We're in this for the money. Let's go! [ animal squealing ] - I've just about had it with you. - [ squealing ] - What's in that stuff? - Snips and snails and puppy dog tails. - Come on. Tell me. - It's a cocktail of my own creation, paralyzes the animal from within, and the tiny dart tip penetrates the skin without damaging it. - [ squealing ] - That bastard, he's gonna give us away. - Then shut him up. Let me see that. Ugh. So much noise. Now I could think. Let's go. - [ growling ] - Layne, you're with me. Gentlemen, you've got Canada's finest. - Gentlemen, we're going for the big game. Jezel, stick close to the western edge. - We have to be out by sunrise, before the rangers do their morning sweep. - I'll see you in four hours. Hey, be careful. - Aww. You actually care? - You don't? - Depends, if you come back for me. - Always. - Ah. Get out of here before I have to punch some more sense into you. - Hmm. Gentlemen. - [ chittering ] - Ah, guess he found his friend. - Good. Now that they know what they're up against, those little thugs will leave us alone. - Poor little guy. [ laughs ] - [ chittering ] [ group chittering ] [ snarling ] [ wind blowing ] [ large animal grunting ] - Vedder. Eyes. - Copy that, boss. [ Layne ] I didn't know this zoo had this many animals. - This isn't a zoo. It's a refuge. - What's the difference between a refuge and a zoo? - A refuge is where animals go before they go to the zoo. You'll do good to educate yourself. - Yeah. - Now help me open this gate. [ animal groans ] - Jackpot. - I'm gonna play with my new toy. - Here. - Dart. - Hey, will that stuff work on something as big as an elephant? - We're about to find out. [ animal chitters ] - Bro, what was that? - Don't worry about it. [ group chittering ] - Hey, what are those things? - I don't really know, but they're getting around us real fast. - Hell, no. - I don't see anything. [ chittering, snarling continue ] - [ screams ] - [ screams ] - [ rifle fires ] - [ screaming ] Damn! [ screaming ] Ah, shit! [ screaming ] ♪ - [ screaming ] - [ gunfire ] - [ chittering ] [ snarls ] - [ screaming ] Toronto! - Vedder! We are leaving! - Here! We gotta get out of here, man! [ gasping ] [ Jezel clicking tongue ] Don't be shy. Come on out. Mama Jezel wants to come out and play. Give me the bag. [ spraying ] - Ugh. That smell. - They'll think it's their mom - Nobody's home. - [ chittering ] - Wait. Come on out. Hi. I'm your friend. Get the cage ready. Come on out to play. Come on now, baby. [ twig snaps ] - What's that sound? - Calm down. You're scaring him. - I hear footsteps. - Stop being paranoid, and help me. Get the berries. Step right in... just like that. Mama needs a new pair of shoes. Just like that. Got it. - Easy money. - Told you. All right. [ sighs ] - [ porcupine chitters ] - Oh. Mama porcupine. Oh, don't be mad. We just took your baby. You can have more. - [ squeals ] - All right, let's go. - Stop. - Layne, run. - [Australian accent ] Put the gun down right now. - Ooh. I love a man with an accent. - I said drop it. - Fine. Wow, chill. - How many more are there? - Porcupines? - More of you, smartass. - We came alone. - You're lying. Cuff 'em both. - Told you I heard footsteps. - Shut up, Layne. - Why don't you both shut up? - [ chitters ] - Hey, little one. No one's gonna hurt you anymore. What did you shoot her up with? - A magic potion. I'm a witch. - Is this all some kind of game to you? - Yes! [ laughing ] Oh, come on. It's not like they're endangered or anything. - Take our new friends. Put 'em in the back of the jeep. Isaiah, bring a second cage. I want to keep the mother separate until we know what's going on with her. - Yeah. You got it. - It's all right, sweetheart. I know just the person who's gonna fix you up. [ music playing ] - [ grunting ] [ animal squealing ] - Hi, Rosie. Got a big day. - Yo. Good news. Bike's fixed. - K.D., you can be a mechanic in your next life, but today, can you please stick to being a vet? - Oh, it's her graduation? - Yeah. She can't stay in here her whole life. - That the Ginga vaccine? - Among other things. If the herd rejects her, she'll need as many advantages as we can give her. - Aww. She'll be fine. You think we should sedate her? - I just gave her a mild sedative, but I can't protect her forever. - Hey. - They call it a jungle for a reason. - Brooke! Hock's on the radio! - Uh, I'm busy. Can you take a message? - He got some poachers. - Randy, are you okay? How many poachers are there? - Two that we know of so far. We managed to catch 'em before they did too much damage. - What kind of damage are we talking about? - They shot a crested porcupine with some kind of toxin. - Okay, toxin. Can you be more specific? - I'm not sure. I need you to take a look at her for yourself. Be there soon. - You're bringing the poachers here? - Unless you got a better idea where we should hold them for pickup. - You bring those animal butchers back here, and I will not be held responsible for my actions! - Easy, Brooke. See you in five. - She sounds like quite the charmer. - Lady, you have no idea. - We can stay here if you want. - And let those animal thieves ruin Rosie's big day? No way. She's being released back into the wild as scheduled. - All right. You heard the boss. Let's load up Rosie and take her home. - Wait. If you're gonna go out there, you need protection. - But we got tranquilizer guns in the jeep. - These aren't for the animals. - You think there's more poachers. - Well, if there is, - then we need to be protected. - Oh, please. If you really want to get back at those poachers, hose 'em down with these, animal pheromones. - [ chuckles ] Then all the cheetahs, boars, and antelopes of the refuge would chase 'em down. - Humped to death by a lion. [ men laughing ] - If that don't teach a poacher, nothing will. - [ laughs ] - K.D., I'm serious. You watch yourself out there. - Yeah. Come on. - Logan, let's go prepare for our guest. [ Vedder panting ] Gotta get out of here. Wait. No, stop. Stop. Can't breathe. [ panting ] Oh, God! - How bad is it? - It's bad! - Let me see. - It's bad! No! - Show me. Show me. - No, no, no. - Oh, God! - Oh, God. No. - Okay. Okay. Uh, there's first aid in the truck. - No. No, I'm not going back there! - But you could die of an infection! - We'll die if we go back there! - What do you wanna do? - We gotta get the hell out of here, man! [ groans ] The base must be nearby. - Whoa! You want us to turn ourselves in? - It's better than being dead! - [ grunting ] - What animal was that? - I'm not sticking around to find out! - No! We have come too far and done too much to get arrested now! - You wanna die in here? - The wall, over the wall. We'll climb over. - I can't climb with this hand. - I'll boost you up. - No. We gotta get the hell out of this place before someone else gets killed! - I am not getting arrested because you decide to grow a conscience! Now get up there! - [ grunting ] - Move! - [ both scream ] - [ screams ] - [ screaming ] - Is the prep area clear? - Let me see the porcupines. - [ snarling ] - How long has she looked like this? - She didn't look like that when I picked her up. - Is it rabies? Or peritonitis? - The babies are fine. - She's gonna chew through that. - Yeah. Logan, give me five ccs of pentobarbital to keep her calm. - On it. - Hock, where do you want 'em? - What did you do to her? - Lady, you're gonna have to beat it out of me! - You're a monster! - Hey, hey, hey, calm down. You're better than that. We'll get justice, but we'll do it the right way, okay? - Jail? [ laughs ] Been there. Done that. [ Hock ] Lock 'em to the bench. Secure the weapons. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Wow, this is nice. What is this, Gucci? - Careful! That's a custom-made item. - Let's go. - So you like to shoot things, huh? - You have no idea. - [ laughs ] Hey, what if I have to use the potty? - Use this. - You gonna be okay? - [ breathes deeply ] - I'll behave. - Okay. I'm gonna call it in, organize a pickup. - Okay. - [ porcupine snarling ] - Logan, where are you? ¡Ándale! - I'm coming. I'm coming. Sorry. - Uh, dispatch, this is Animal Rescue. You read? - This is dispatch. Over. - [ snarling ] - I have it. - Yeah, we're gonna need a chopper out here stat. - What's the situation? - What's the soonest you can be here? - In about six hours. - Six hours? - [ hissing ] - I didn't know they could do that. - They can't. - This stuff barely fazed her. - Give me another five ccs. - But that'll kill her. - And the disease she's carrying can't? I can't help her until I calm down her convulsions. - Here. - Just get here when you can. They're sending a chopper for pickup, but they won't be here for six hours. - Six hours? Randy, really? They can't get one here any faster? - I guess animal thieves aren't high on the priority list. - Okay, well, I don't think I can handle them being here for six more minutes. - Well, don't. Just go to your lab. I'll take care of them. - [ sighs ] - Logan, let's get to work. In 60 minutes, we'll wake 'em and do a urine and alkaline test. I want to get started right away on the blood work to find out a... a... - You okay? - [ sighs ] Yeah. Uh, just the stress, I guess. - Here. Here's some water. Look, don't worry. Those poachers will get what's coming to 'em. - Will they? 'Cause what if there are no consequences? - Help! Help! Help me! Help! - Randy! - Help! - Randy! Randy! Randy! He tried to break in to the lab! - Who did? - They're gonna kill us! They're gonna kill us all! Close the doors! Load up the guns! They're gonna kill us! - Toronto? - How many more of you are out there? - Dead! Dead! They're all dead. - Who's dead? - Everyone! - Damn it, stop questioning him, and start helping him! We'll tell you everything you want to know! - Where's he bleeding from? - Hard to tell. It's everywhere. - This isn't his blood. - Of course it's not my blood! - They did it! - Who did this? - The animals! - What animals? - Uh... they looked like, uh... some little meerkats and a rhino. I swear to God. They did it! - Killer meerkats? You high or something? - He sure is. - What does that have to do with anything? - Why don't you believe me? - Oh, I believe you. I believe you're baked out of your mind. - I am not high! - You know, this stuff makes you see crazy things. Sometimes it makes you do crazy things. - I didn't kill any of my friends. - What happened? They threaten to take your cut or something? I don't know how it works with you guys. - I didn't kill anybody! - Prove it. - I'm not going back out there. - Cuff him. - I came here for help! I came here to warn you! - And you are gonna help. We're gonna find your friends. Some of 'em might still be alive. - I'm not going back out there. - What are you trying to hide? - Maybe someone's alive, but I don't think so. - Put him in the jeep. - I told you I'm not going back out there! Why don't you believe me? - I'll believe you once you take me to your pals and you show me where this animal attack apparently happened. - The animals are going crazy! They want our blood! - They want revenge! - Come on, buddy! We're leaving! - If we go out there, we're gonna die! [ groans ] - Don't worry. He's still conscious. - What did you do to me? You don't know what you're doing. You're making a mistake. - Maybe he's telling the truth! - Toronto wouldn't hurt any of us. - The jungle's gonna eat you and your team alive, warden. [ ranger ] Shut up, and move! - [ sighs ] Looks like I'm gonna have to break a promise. - No. - Yeah. Looks like you're gonna have to deal with them after all. - But what if he's right? - About the animal attacks? Come on. He was high as a hyena. - You saw how that porcupine was acting. Okay, what if other animals are acting the same way? - Remember the kids from Morocco? - Yeah, the ones who tried to steal the colobus monkeys. - The kids were so high on shrooms, they probably thought King Kong was after 'em. - I suppose. - You gonna be okay? I can leave Isaiah here if you need a hand. - No. Logan and I can handle the ladies. And besides, K.D. and the others will be back soon. - Okay. I'll be back soon, too. - Okay. - Hey! - Hey, hey! Can you at least let us out of this room? - We won't go anywhere. We promise. - You're not going anywhere until the chopper gets here. - What if Toronto's right and the animals come in here and try to get us? - Then I guess you'll know what it feels like to be poached. - Is that a threat? Hey! Come back here! - Hello? - We're not done! - Logan, get me the syringe. Let's see what's gotten into you. - My guess is you guys broke in through the east gate, yeah? - Hey, he's talking to you! - I don't remember. - Listen. Cooperate with me, I'll make sure your girlfriends get a good deal when the authorities come to pick 'em up. - Yes. Yeah, we came in through the east gate, hiked in a few miles. - What were you hunting, aardvarks? - Elephants. - Right. Well, they do share the same territory. - Meerkats? No! No! No, no, no, no! Turn around right now! - What, 'cause of meerkats? - Turn around right now! - Oh, and, uh, termites live here, too. - Yeah, and all the little animals that suck 'em up. - [ inhaling ] - [ laughs ] Hey, good one, brother. - [ laughs ] - You guys are actually brothers? - Yeah. - The resemblance is uncanny. Why are we slowing down? Are your guns loaded? - Chill. I don't see anyone. [ Toronto ] There! Right there! - Isaiah, come with me. Let's look for survivors. - Wait! Wait, wait, wait! You're leaving? - Mike, keep an eye on our friend. - Copy. - I showed you what you wanted me to! They were killed! - Stop talking! - I didn't do it! Why don't you believe me? - Meerkats didn't do this. Body parts everywhere. [ animal chittering ] Stay back. - [ chittering ] - [ winces ] - Oh! - [ squeals ] [ chittering stops ] [ animals snarling ] - What the hell is that? - Yeah, what is that? - [ screams ] - Isaiah! - Hit it! [ Isaiah yelling ] - Oh, man! - [ screaming ] Get it off! - Come on! Hit it! - No! - What'd I tell you, warden? The jungle's getting its revenge! - I still think we're releasing her too early. Look at how scared she is. - Nah. She's a fighter. - Just hope one of those crocs doesn't snatch her up. - Whoa! You trying to scare her or something? Look, Rosie is gonna acclimate just fine. - [ thud ] - [ animal squeals ] You okay? - Yeah, I'm good. - What the hell was that? - Oof. Poor bloke didn't stand a chance. - It looked like it was dead before we hit it. - Hey, let's get Rosie out of the cage. - Yeah. - Sorry about my driving, Rosie, but you're home now, and I bet the other hippos can't wait to welcome you in. Speaking of which... - Where are the other hippos? Hmm. Okay, well, there's definitely something not right going on here. I mean, the virus, it just keeps spreading, and the antibodies-- Oh, wait. [ gasps ] - What is it? - That woman is a monster. - Brooke, don't do anything crazy. - She's gonna answer for this. - Oh. - Where did you get noradrenaline? - I don't know anybody by that name. - No wonder it took ten ccs of tranquilizer to sedate that porcupine. You baked her brain with liquid aggression. - What are you talking about? The toxin paralyzes them from the inside out. If anything, it gave 'em a high they'll never forget. - Did you see how that porcupine was acting? Did it look like she was high on mushrooms? You lunatic! - Well, maybe I made a mistake. - A mistake? - Yeah. It could happen to anybody. - You shoot up an animal with toxic chemical, and all you can think to say is that you made a mistake? - Like, who cares? - I care! - And why? - What? - This planet is wasting away. I'm just trying to make some cash before we're all extinct. [ laughs ] Stop looking at me like I'm a Judas. There's more people like me out there than you anyway. - Hock to base. Come in. Whoever's there, pick up. [ Brooke ] Hock, have you found any others? - Yeah, - and I'm afraid he was right. - Right about what? Right about the animal attacks or the poachers? - All of it. Brooke... Isaiah's dead. - How? - Aardvark attack. - [ scoffs ] Aardvarks aren't aggressive. - Well, this one was. I don't know what's going on. - Oh, God. What about K.D.? - What about him? - He and the others went to release the baby hippo to the wild. Okay, if the animals are acting crazy and they're out there-- - Don't worry about K.D. I need you to secure the base and keep an eye on our two friends, okay? - I think I know what's causing this. When will you be back? - Soon. We'll radio as soon as we get eyes on K.D. Don't let any more animals in the building. K.D., you there? Vet team, I need you to state your last position. Over. We need to get to the river, get eyes on K.D. - Hey, hey! Are you gonna take these off? What if the animals attack again? How am I supposed to defend myself? - You won't. - What am I supposed to do? - Run, fast. - Logan, check on the porcupines. If the mama's awake, sedate her and the babies. Then lock up the lab. For now, it's gonna be our quarantine zone. - Quarantine? - There's a strong possibility this affliction is contagious. Go to the lab now. I'm gonna figure out what started this in the first place. How do I get this dart out? - Screw you. [ both laugh ] - Fine. - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - I'll get it out this way. - Whoa! Whoa! Chill! - Okay, you just... push the latch toward you to-- to the back. - Thanks. Now who's gonna tell me what this is made out of? Are we gonna do that the hard way, too? - [ chuckles ] - [ snarling ] - Oh, shit. Here, porky, porky, porky. Here, porky. Where you at? Logan's got something tasty for you. Where you at? Okay. Want to dance? Bring it. - [ clattering ] - Logan?! Logan? Logan? - [ snarling ] - [ screaming ] - [ snarling ] [ skittering ] [ snuffling ] [ grunting ] [ watch alarm beeps ] [ beeping stops ] [ hisses ] [ footsteps pattering ] - Ahh! - [ hisses ] - [ yelps ] - [ snarling ] - Get off of me! - [ snarling ] - You're a bad mama. [ groaning ] [ panting ] [ winces ] [ sighs ] [ women screaming ] - [ muffled scream ] - [ screams ] - [ squealing ] - Get--Get it off! Get it off her face! - [ screaming ] - [ yells ] - You need something thick, like a-- a glove, yeah! Pull it off of her! She's dying! - I--It's on too tight! - [ screams ] - [ screams ] - [ screaming ] [ sighs ] [ panting ] Oh, my God. [ gasps ] - What?! What?! - Your shoulder! - [ yells ] [ panting ] - Hock to K.D.! Are you there? - They're probably already dead. - Is anybody talking to you? - Face it, warden. We're not the kings of the jungle anymore! - Vet team, do you read? En route to your assumed location by the river. Can you confirm you're there? Over. - Looks like the mothers are taking to her. - Let's just hope the bulls take to her as well. [ hooves pounding ] That's odd. - Yeah. Nothing should be herding around this time of day. [ hooves pounding ] Run! Oh, my God! [ yells ] It's a stampede! Oh, my God! Dear Lord, I come to you in fear. - Less talk! More running! [ both yelling ] - Go! Go, go, go! Ahh! - Need a ride? - Get in, now! - [ K.D. ] Oh, thank you, Jesus! - All right, guys. [ Hock ] Wait. What just happened? - Go, go, go, go, go! Come on! - Go! Go! - I'm trying! - Come on! - Something's wrong. I think it's flooded. - Go! - Yeah, well, you better figure it out now! - K.D., what do I do?! - Push the pedal, and press the button! Then push the button! Push the button! - Got it! Why didn't you just say so? [ both scream ] - Go! - Got it! - Come on, man! - Go! - [ tires squeal ] - Whoa! - Ford! - W-Wait! - We gotta shoot these bastards! - Huh? - [ gunshot ] - Oh, God! [ yelps ] - Your little BB gun isn't gonna hurt these things! Uncuff me! Do you want everyone to die? - Take his cuffs off! - What? You're gonna uncuff him? - You're gonna thank me. - And you're gonna give him a gun? You're gonna give a bad guy a gun! - [ laughing ] Die! - They're gonna hit us! They're gonna hit us! You gotta go fast! Go! - [ guns firing ] - [ yells ] - To the right! To the right! - Hey, man, tell him to get-- get away! Drive the other way! - Why won't you die? - Get down! - No, no, no, no, no! No! - [ screams ] [ all screaming ] [ Brooke panting ] [ screams ] [ panting ] - Hey, girl, are you okay? Are you dying, too? Because if you are, I really don't wanna starve to death in this room... with this dead body! - [ grunts ] - Come on! I wouldn't leave you to die next to your dead friend on the floor. Come on! - Shut up! [ winces ] - Come on, lady! Help me! [ sighs ] - Randy? Are you there? It's Brooke. Randy, answer me! K.D., are you there? Hello? Is anyone out there? Is anyone out there? Please! I'm all alone. [ sighs ] What guarantee do I have if I let you out, you don't hurt me? - My main concern is the porcupine had rabies, so we need to disinfect your wound immediately. Do you have any rabies immunoglobulin on hand? - Of course. - Good. We need to get you a shot before it compromises your immune system. - How do you know all this? - I'm more than just good looks - and killer tattoos. - [ chuckles ] - I also think I know how to fix this. - How? - The toxin, it's obviously what's driving these animals crazy. I created it, so I can counteract it. But I can't do it while I'm locked up. I'm also concerned about your quill wounds. - I know. I was just about to take a blood sample of it to see if the toxin you shot that porcupine up with got in my system, too. - Even if it did, you're immune. - You don't know that. - I made sure the toxin didn't kill people when I created it. I'm not completely evil. [ thunder crashing ] - [ sputters ] What the... - Easy. K.D., he's awake! - [ winces ] What happened? - You got thrown from the jeep when we crashed. I thought you might take it the wrong way if I slapped you awake, so I used a little water instead. [ thunder rumbling ] - Where's Mike? The other ranger. - I didn't, uh, want to leave his body out in the rain, so I found a blanket in the jeep. Also, I found your gun and some ammo. - You stayed? - Don't know where the hell else I would go. Besides... - [ grunts ] - where are we? - [ sighs ] Out by the western border. - Close to base? - About a mile and a half, maybe two. - So walking distance. - Yeah. - [ K.D. ] What?! Are you crazy? You want us to walk? Who knows what else is out there waiting to rip us in half? - It's fine. We'll radio Brooke. We'll get her to come pick us up in the SUV. - No. Radio's smashed. I checked. - Okay. Grab what you can. - So--So you want us to go on a nature hike right now? - Look, if we stay calm, move quietly, I think we'll be okay. - No! Th-This is not going on! This-- This is not supposed to be happening! It was just a few hours ago, I just woke up! I had plans. I was supposed to get on the-- uh, a bike. I was supposed to go see the-- the zebras. - I want you to stay with me, K.D.! - I did not sign up for this! - Yes, you did! Took an oath to protect the animals, remember? - But who is gonna protect us? - You need to hold it together, man. - Oh! You! You are gonna tell me what to do?! If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't even be in this mess in the first place! - K.D.! - [ grunting ] - [ spits ] - Stop! - No, it's okay. Let him go. Come on. I deserve it. Come on. Take a shot. - Snap out of it, K.D.! We need your help right now. Look, you know this area better than everyone, right? - Of course I do. My dad designed it. - Okay. What's the best way for us to get out of here? [ thunder rumbling ] - Through that gulch. That'll take us back to base. It'll be muddy... with lots of bugs... but we can make it. - Then let's move. I don't wanna be out here after dark. God only knows what's gonna come after us then. - Listen, Ms. Sullivan, I need you to calm down. - No! You listen to me! - I've alerted the enforcement agents that are already en route to your situation, and they're still being scheduled to arrive before sundown. The medical and coroner teams are still being assembled. - It's still being assembled? What in the world is the holdup? - Dr. Sullivan, the continuing changes in the weather and your remote location provide challenges in getting to you as quickly as we'd like. We're using all available resources and personnel we have at our disposal. You are not alone in this. - Well, it sure feels like I'm alone. Is there anyone that can get here faster? - Be assured we're doing our best. - Well, if this is your best, then your best sucks. Ms. Sulliv-- God! - Get the hell away from me! - Sorry! I slipped! - You two cut it out. - Yeah, well, keep him the hell away from me. - I said I'm sorry. - Oh, okay, you're sorry. What, is that all you have to say to the mothers of those baby elephants you killed? What about those monkeys you steal and sell to some debutantes in Paris? - Quiet. - Whoa. [ thunder rumbling ] - Where are we? - We're in the middle of a game trail. - A game trail? - Yeah. You know, a game trail, sort of like what you turned this whole refuge into! - Would you two knock it off? Looks like the animals are starting to feed off each other. [ animal growls ] - We need to find a detour. - But this is the quickest way. - To what? Being pooped out of whatever animal did this? I don't think so. - Toronto's right. We need to get out in the open. Hopefully then we'll have a chance to see the animals before they see us. - Yeah, but we can't get back to base unless we cross the bridge, and the bridge is right over this hill. - Maybe we don't cross the bridge. Maybe we go under it. - Your microscope needs an upgrade. - I put in a grant for a new one. - [ sighs ] Well, we had the same problem at Princeton. Can you believe that? One of the top Ivy League schools, and we still had cruddy lab stations. - You went to Princeton? - And Yale. It's not so polite to act so surprised. - Well, I just didn't think somebody who's-- - Like me? Would blow every chance she had up her nose or veins? [ scoffs ] Being an addict and a whiz in chemistry is a bad combination. Did you make any contact? - The chopper that was dispatched earlier is still three hours away. Told them we'd need a medical team, and that's gonna take even longer. - [ glass rattles ] - Whoa. - Here. Let me help. - No, no, no. - [ Jezel ] I got it. - [ chittering ] - Whoa, careful. Spike's in there. - Spike? - Yeah. While you were on the radio, I put the baby porcupine in that box. We're gonna need him to test the antidote on, which we can do... now that I've successfully reversed the toxin. - You reversed it that quickly? I-- That sounds way too easy. - Oh, it was a bitch, trust me. Luckily, I had the proteins necessary to enable the reaction. - Where? Surely this little vet clinic didn't have all the chemicals and compounds you would need. - No... but I do... and so do you. The enzymes necessary to reverse the toxin is human blood. Told you I was smart. - I'm impressed. - Ah, it was nothing. - Just one question for you. - Shoot. - Why are you wasting your life capturing exotic animals? - [ squealing ] [ Jezel ] Hey, hey, hey! Calm down in there! You don't want me to hurt you like I did last time. - You okay? - [ squeals ] - He's okay. What about you? Any symptoms? - Uh, no fever, a little nauseous. - Yeah, but you've been nauseous before today, right? At least two weeks - How do you know that? - Your blood sample gave it away. - Gave what away? - You really don't know? - I'm pregnant, aren't I? - [ chuckles ] - Okay, but if I'm infected and then the virus starts to attack-- - Humans are immune to the toxin. - You don't know that. - I created it that way. The virus can't attack proteins in human blood. It was my way of ensuring the poachers wouldn't kill themselves while they're in the jungle with it. They're lousy shots. - Jezel, if you're so smart, why are you wasting your life doing this? - Maybe I'm not as smart as you think I am. - No, why do you hunt and capture the animals? - [ sighs ] When you hurt like I hurt... sometimes the only thing that'll make you feel better is hurting something back. [ Spike squealing ] - [ chuckles ] Guess they have the last laugh now, huh? [ chuckles ] Payback is such a bitch. - If you started this, then you can finish it, too. - Let's hope so. - [ hisses ] [ snarling ] - We gotta go get him. - Right. - You first. - You first. - I think this is where we'll need to cross. [ K.D. ] Oh, hell, no! No! You don't even know what's in that water! - We need to get to the other side of the river. - No! Absolutely not! - Dude, just get your whiny butt in the water. - Toronto... - No, who you calling wimpy? - No, listen. I'm talking about you. You been complaining this entire time. - No, you-- - Toronto! - What?! - What?! - Just stand very still. - [ sighs ] There's something behind me, isn't there? - I'm gonna count to three... - Aww... and then you move, okay? One... - Move! - [ K.D. screaming ] [ panting ] What? - I think I owe you one for that. - I'll put it on your tab. We might need to go back. - No! We're not going back in there! And we not getting in the water! - K.D., I like you, but I need you to shut up so I can think. Are we near the hippo dock? K.D.? - Oh, I thought you wanted me to shut up. - Oh, my God. - Yes. Yes, we're about the Hippo Dock. - Good. 'Cause if I remember correctly, it should be over here. - What? What should be where? - Transportation. [ bowl rattles ] - Sorry. I don't like this. We're supposed to be counteracting the toxin, not shooting more animals with it. - We don't have to use the toxin. We can load it with whatever we want. - Stay there, and watch the door. I don't think it's in here. - [ sighs ] - Well, there went our test subject. - We're gonna have to find another animal that's infected. - [ scoffs ] Just like that? - What's the problem? - The problem? You've seen how the porcupine acts on that disease. Can you even imagine a bigger animal, like a tiger? - Exactly. That's why we need to stop this as soon as possible. - What? So we just go outside, find another wild animal that's crazed and wants to kill us? - Yeah. - And what if we don't find one? - [ sighs ] Then we'll make one. - [ K.D. ] Come on, guys. Wait up. - You know, I get it now. - What's that? - I get why you work so hard to protect this place. - Oh, yeah? - It really is paradise. - Well, we wouldn't have to work so hard to protect it if it weren't for people like you. - Yeah, that's why I think I should work for you. - [ chuckles ] Why would I hire you? - Eh, you saved my life. You must see something good in me. - He didn't save your life 'cause he likes you. He saved it 'cause-- I don't know. - [ water lapping ] - Shh! - It's not another snake, is it? - I don't know. I thought I felt something... something really big. It's not much further. Come on. [ Jezel ] Damn it. Where's a bloodthirsty animal when you need one? - I don't like this, okay? We're supposed to be curing the animals, not infecting more. - If the cure works, it will reverse the infection, but we won't know until we try it first. - We should go back and wait for the chopper, wait for help. - Do you know how many more animals could turn before then? - Okay, we're not equipped to handle this. - [ splashing ] - Shh. - Are you insane? A crocodile is dangerous enough without the toxin in its system. - Do you see any better options? This isn't exactly a petting zoo. - Let's keep looking. - [ sighs ] Okay, fine. - Good. - Psyche. - [ fires dart ] - [ growling ] - Wait. - We need to see if it works. - [ hissing ] - Are you crazy? Don't get so close. - It's changing... fast. - Amphibians are coldblooded. Makes sense that they would process the toxin differently than mammals would. - [ growling ] - [ gasps ] - Give me the antidote! Give me the antidote! [ gasps ] Ohh! I missed. - [ screams ] No! - No! [ screaming ] What? - Thanks for being a lousy shot. - Is it dead? - Looks like it's in a sort of unconscious state, maybe a coma. - It's changing back. [ chuckles ] It's really working. - It's working. - [ Jezel laughs ] I actually did something right! - Quick, let's replicate this. Come on. - Looks like the weather's clearing up. - Yo, I'm tired. - I know, but we gotta keep moving, K.D. Keep going. - Oh, come on. Let the little wimp take a break. - Yo, shut up! And why did I get the little boat, huh? This thing don't even feel safe! - That's good! Use that energy, and paddle that little boat! - [ laughs ] - Don't make me laugh. - Why not? - 'Cause I don't like you. - Oh, all my friends hate me. We'll get along great. - Ah, great. The poacher wants to make friends while we're at a zoo, surrounded by zombie animals. - Like zoombies. [ Hock ] There's the lab. Put your back into it, guys. - [ hippo bellows ] - What the... - [ screams ] Where'd it go? - [ hippo grunts ] - [ gasps ] - Ohh! - [ hippo grunts ] - K.D.! - No! This ain't fair! I've spent my whole life taking care of these animals! I don't deserve this! I saved you! I saved you! I saved you! - [ screaming ] - No! - That's a first. - It's coming back! It's coming back! [ yells ] [ hippo bellows ] - Toronto! Toronto! Toronto! Come on! - Guess that makes us even. - Don't mention it. [ hippo grunting ] [ pistol fires ] - Randy! - Brooke. - I thought I lost you. You didn't answer the radio. - Sorry. The radios got trapped wh-- I didn't think you'd miss me so much. - Everything's changed I've changed. We've changed. It's all changed. - Yeah. - Toronto, please, give me a break. - She hasn't changed. - We found a cure. - Cure? This fast? - Yeah. The key is human blood. - We're immune to it. - So if we combine our blood with the original toxin-- - We can reverse the change in the animals. We can save them. - Wait. I feel like there's something you guys aren't telling me. - I found out a lot today. - Like what? - If I tell you, it'll change everything between us. - I'm... - [ growling ] - [ screams ] - It didn't work! Move! - Let's go! - Come on! - Grab something to barricade the entrance! - Got it! - Why didn't the antidote work? - The toxin's too strong. You can't reverse it. - Something must have compromised the serum. Outside air? Metal properties when we put it in the dart? God, I don't know. - We'll worry about that later. Right now, we need to barricade this door. - Brooke, what are you doing? - It's fine! - No, this is too heavy! You could hurt your baby! - Baby? You're pregnant? - I just found out. - I guess we know who the daddy is. - I don't know what to say. - Congratulations. [ metal creaking ] - Something's in the pipes. - Wait here. [ metal creaking ] [ creaking continues ] [ creaking continues ] [ water bubbling ] You gotta be kidding me. [ crocodile bellowing ] [ hisses ] - It's in the building! - [ gasps ] - [ crocodile bellows ] - [ screams ] - Do you got any more bullets left? - It's useless. - [ gun clatters ] Bounced right off it like Tic Tacs. - I know why the cure didn't work. - Not now, Jezel. - If we can't kill it, then we're gonna have to trap it. - The cure will only work in human blood. I thought I could make a synthetic substitute, but it won't work outside of our systems, not in a dart, not in a syringe. - Just be quiet, you two. There's a freezer in the kitchen. Maybe we can lure it in there. - Give me the cure so I can put in me. - No, no. - Are you crazy? No. - We are the missing ingredient. Maybe that's why they're attacking us, not out of violence, but out of the instinctive hope that they can be cured. - Okay, even if that is true, I don't have another dart. - The serum's in the lab. - If I put the cure in me, I can save all of us! - Jezel! - [ gasps ] - [ screams ] - [ Toronto] Jezel! - No! - [ screaming ] - Jezel! No! No! - Randy! Randy! - [ grunting ] Randy! Randy, it's dead! - No, no. - [ panting ] - It's dead. It's dead. - No. No. No. No. No, no, no. - T-Toronto. - Don't touch me! No, baby. No. No. No. - What are you doing? - Finishing the work Jezel and I started. There are still traces of the antidote in the crocodile's system, but oxygen compromised the integrity of the cure, and the virus was able to overpower it. - Can we make it stronger? - The cure is fine, but Jezel was right. The flaw's in how it's administered. We can only cure the animals the same way that they were infected, through a bite. And since the protein in the human blood is the only thing that keeps the antidote stable and pure... - They have to bite one of us. - We have to inject ourselves with the antidote so they can feed directly off us, essentially turning ourselves into living vaccines. - You want us to willingly feed ourselves to the animals. - It's just a theory, but I think Jezel was right. - Yeah, and you saw what happened to her. - Calm down. - Your girlfriend wants to feed us to the animals. I knew you vegans were frickin' crazy! - I don't have all the answers. I'm still trying to figure that out. I don't want it come to that. - Good, 'cause it won't, - not even close. - Quiet! - [ helicopter thrumming ] - Do you hear that? - Man, you been hearing stuff all day. - No, wait. - Oh, great. What kind of animal is coming to kill us now? - That's no animal. - It's help. Thank God. I didn't think it was gonna get here. - Hey, guys! Come on! Let's go! - [ gasps ] Oh, my God. - [ growling ] - Behind you! Run! - Come on! - Run, you meathead! Run! - [ screaming ] - Oh! - [ gasps ] [ animals grunting, squealing ] - Oh, that's not good. - Back inside! Back inside! How long is this roof gonna last? - We're completely surrounded. - Does anyone know how to fly a chopper? - I used to fly one back in the service, but it's not gonna be much help in here. - That's our only way out of this hellhole. - We gotta get to it. - How? Animals are everywhere. - We hold up in this room until reinforcements arrive. Brooke, secure the lab. - Hold up in this room? - Dispatch. - Like sheep? - Dispatch. It's not possible. They've cut the line. - Do we have any other weapons? - What, you think we've got some kind of hidden arsenal around here? - [ animals grunting, snarling ] - They're here! They're here! They're inside the complex. - Well, they're not in this room, so... - How long? - Long enough for us to stop it. One for each of us. When the animals feed off our blood, the cure will transfer directly to their bodies. Jezel was right. The cure doesn't work if it's transferred into a dart or a syringe. It's only effective if it's inside our bodies. - But we don't know if that'll work. - The animals will revert back to their natural state. Okay, and this life that we love and value, okay, in this safari and in other jungles like it, it'll continue to thrive and endure. - But what if it doesn't work? - It has to work! - No. - Randy. - What about the baby? - I can't let you-- - Randy! Do you not think that I've thought about this? It's not an easy decision to make. We don't do this, there won't be a world for our child to grow up in or anyone else's, for that matter. - Let me see those. - What are you doing? - If I'm gonna kill myself, I want to at least look at what I'm gonna do it with. So this is the cure Jezel made? - So we're all in this together. - No. I'm not gonna let you two die for a mistake I made. - Toronto! - [ groans ] - Help me get him down! Help me get him down. He's going into cardiac arrest! - No, it's okay. It's okay! It's just icy. - Why did you do that?! - So you two can escape. - You're not invincible, Toronto. - It's an antidote, okay? It's not a secret serum to give you powers! [ animal grunting ] - Everyone, back! - [ hisses ] - [ groaning ] - It worked. Jezel was right. - What if it doesn't last? - Jezel said it'll last, it'll last. That girl knew her stuff. - The trick is, how do we keep you alive while they feed off you? - We can't. I'm just the distraction so you two can escape. - What makes you think it's gonna be so easy? - I'll run out, and, when I do, the animals will chase me, and you two can escape. - The animals will just chase you? What's gonna stop them from attacking us? - I got it. Pheromones. We use these for mating purposes when two animals don't quite hit it off. - Great. Hose me down. - You don't have to do this. - We can hole up here. We'll find a way out of the refuge. - Did you expect me to buy that bull? - Toronto, you don't have to die. - Guys, I'm already dead. My friends are dead. Jezel's gone. But you guys, you got something to live for. [ glass breaking ] [ Hock ] Get to the garage! [ animals snarling ] - Here! Block it with this! [ pounding ] - I don't know how long this is gonna hold! - Does this thing run? - Yeah. K.D. just fixed it up. - Aw, K.D., man. It's gonna burn him up in heaven to see me taking this on one last glory ride. Spray me down! [ engine starts ] Okay. As soon as I'm out of here and those animals start chasing me down, you get to that chopper! Do not hesitate! - Absolutely. - And another thing. That kid you're gonna have... don't name it after me. Toronto's a stupid name. Whoo! - He's wrong. It's a brave name. - [ grunting ] [ both sniff ] - This is it. You ready? - Whoo! Yeah! Yee-hah! - N-No! - Remember what we promised. No hesitation. - Come and get some of this fast food, you sons of bitches! Whoo! - Here. Put these on. - You sure you can do this? - [ chuckles ] It's like riding a bike. Hey, don't worry. It's all coming back. [ rotors whirring ] - Got it. We're going home. - This was our home. [ animals grunting ] - The cure is working. - They're changing back. [ sighs ] - [ chittering ] [ squealing ] - Randy! - Ahh! - [ squealing ] What the... - [ gasping ] Randy! - [ grunts ] - Ahh! - Throw it up into the blades! - [ yells ] - Brooke! Brooke! You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Your arm. - Ah, I've had worse. We make quite a pair. - Yes, we do. Yeah. Hi, Dr. Rogers. It's Brooke Sullivan from the Foundation for Endangered Animal Rescue. - Oh, hi, Brooke. It's good to hear from you. - Hi. I just wanted to call and thank you so much for taking in the animals. - Oh, don't mention it. We're looking forward to having a few new cute faces around here. And just so you know, I'm personally overseeing the transfer of the animals. They're gonna love their new home here at Eden Wildlife Zoo. You have nothing to worry about, I can assure you. - That's great. But you have to promise me, if the animals start to exhibit any signs of violent behavior-- - Brooke, our medical staff is exceptional. Nothing gets past them. - Yeah, but if there is a chance that-- - Listen, Brooke, I know you've had a traumatizing experience, and it's completely understandable to be paranoid, but trust me. Your nightmare is over. The animals are gonna love their new home. Listen, Brooke, I'm so sorry to cut you off. I have this whole intern orientation thing that I gotta set up for, because we're opening in just a few weeks. Can we talk later? - Yeah. - Thanks. - [ sighs ] - Monte, how far away are you on those monkeys? ♪
