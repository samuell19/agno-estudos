You've grown so much! This is the history of Blind Teacher Yoshinori. This is Minano Junior High School in Saitama Prefecture. Here is Arai Yoshinori-sensei at the teacher's podium. The husband is an elephant. Textbooks are written in Braille. Here is one volume of the textbook compared to 12 volumes in Braille. It takes time to read them over and over. It's a miracle that a blind person can teach normally. He lost his vision when he was only 34 years old. Out of despair, he became a hermit and became violent towards his family. He lost his teaching position. In the beginning, I didn't think to ask "why did it happen to us?" At the beginning, we were depressed, and we didn't talk to each other at all. I remember looking at my mom's back as she was crying. If I was to have the same condition as my dad...I don't know if I'd be as strong as he is. This story is about a man who, with the help of his family, beat depression & created a miracle. I think anything can become a milestone in a person's life. This drama contains descriptive voiceover track for blind people ("Eye Partner"). The descriptions were not translated. - Please bring samples next week. - Thank you very much! Hello? Of course! For me, that was... when my child was born. I was overwhelmed with feelings when this little fragile kid grabbed my heart. Also my parents... I met so many people and done so much in my life. When I kept recalling this, I remembered this feeling of gratitude and I remembered my teacher. Hey-ho! What a good girl, she didn't cry at all! It's where these people are standing. It was my middle school football coach. Arai Yoshinori-sensei. I was in junior high at the time... Onosakiiii! Hey! Let it all out! O! No! Sa! Ki! I don't get it. You were sent to the bench and that depressed you, right? You're also stuck with your studies Oh, and weren't you dumped? All three combined, it's a triple punch! It's not funny! Don't sulk, laugh it out! I mean, the Sun goes down and then gets up again, right? What he literally said was "the sun gets depressed". But not in this sense... Our teacher, who looked up to Kinpachi-sensei, was noisy and shining with cheerfulness. Kinpachi-sensei is a 1979 drama of a 3rd year junior high school class in Japan. Indeed, he was like the Sun. - He had his one favorite phrase. - This Yoshinori-sensei? "You'll forget about me when you graduate!" "Even so, visit me one day." Visit me one day. Happy things, sad things, it all starts now, doesn't it? When you reach a certain milestone in your long life, maybe you'll remember me in that moment. When you do, come see me. Teachers are always teachers to their students. Got it, Onosaki? Whenever it is, come see me. I laugh my way through life. Isn't it here? Right. Wait here, I'll surprise him. Right Good morning, is this Arai Yoshinori-sensei's house? Do you know him? - Daddy. - Dad? Right! You're his daughter. Is your dad home? Onosaki's asking. Excuse me. Sorry for intruding... Your dad is...? Your dad... Sir? Yoshinori-sensei? I couldn't believe it. Who are you!? Mommy! - Who are you? - No, I mean... At that time, my favorite teacher, Yoshinori-sensei, had changed and was falling deeper and deeper into depression. Original air date: August 27, 2016 Blind Yoshinori-sensei: invisible hope and visible passion - Morning! - Good morning! Ah, new students! Nice and shiny uniforms! The warbler is chirping. Can you hear it? They practice in the fields, only to go back to the mountains. They're still young, yet they do their best. It's the same with you, 1st year students. Akiba, you're sporting a perm again? - It's puberty! You're just brazen, not growing up! Good morning. - Thanks for the other day. - Ah, the opening day meeting! Thank you. No problem! I have some worries about teaching, so I'm counting on your help. - I'm looking forward to be working with you. - Same here. Cherry blossoms are pretty, aren't they... Yeah, very pretty... Cherry blossoms... Yoshinori-sensei had a crush on the music teacher, Mayumi-san. But this story unfolded after my graduation. They got married, had children, helped and supported each other all the time both worked and took care of the house. I put it in the entrance. Your hat, Rina! - You too, Yuki. - Coming! Let's go, let's go! - Their soccer match is next week. - OK. I have a choir competition next month. - Do your best. - Got it. Pass it over! Pass it! Pass it! Alright, gather round! What is it? Today those little flies are pretty persistent. Seriously... This is not normal. Sir, there are no flies here. Strange... How long are you going keep sleeping? Wake up! My right eye won't open, I see pitch black. What are you saying? It's open. It's open, you don't see anything? - I don't like it. Go to the hospital. - It's my day off! - Go to the ER. - I'm fine, I slept too much. Dear... The nightmare has begun. They happily reconciled. The afternoon nap? Finally fell asleep here. - What about Miki and Rina? - In the park with grandpa. How did it go at the hospital? I'll have to quit teaching soon. What do you mean? Is it about your eye? Retinal detachment, they said. Retinal detachment? It happens when the retina separates from the layer underneath. I may not be able to see. It may lead to blindness. I have to undergo surgery. It may get difficult once it gets worse. I don't want to... It'll hurt. Right? It'll be painful. He underwent emergency surgery. It took about two hours, and after that he stayed home. Then, in the hospital, he heard the verdict. Yoshinori-sensei really believed it would get better from now on. Dear? Although... Hey. - Dad. - Can you see? - Yoshinori. - Mom. Yoshinori-san. You're here too, mother. - How are you? - I'm fine. Yoshinori-sensei's vision in his right eye was still fuzzy. Then... take care. Ah, Mayumi. You want to hear dad's input on this? The "Since you've left home, you're an Arai now" one? Yes. Whatever happens, you can never come back. With that being said, he told me to give you an allowance. Eat something tasty, right? - So little! - That's what you think? This is my allowance. Just joking. Thank you. That's all. Yoshinori-sensei struggled with his teaching duties while having impaired vision in his eye. You were close. You missed it. You wrote it strangely! Damn it! And just when he thought it wouldn't get worse... What is it? It's dark. Dark spots... The retina in his right eye continued to detach. He underwent another surgery but it only got worse, until he finally lost vision in his eye. Nice. Yamazaki, don't forget about that area. Sir, could you help us? Yamano-kun was fooling around and he tossed my shoe up there. Yamano get down, it's dangerous. I'll do it. Huh? Really? That's okay, I'll do it. What is that? You can get it. It still hasn't healed. I have trouble assessing distance with one eye. That's why you can't work in such a condition. Can't work... Coaching the soccer club is out of the question. Clubs have to be supervised by capable teachers. I made this decision after getting complaints from parents. Aren't you just saying I became useless? - Even with one eye I still can- - This is for your sake. Please take care of your eyes now. One, two. One, two. - Yoshinori-sensei! - Here! OK, OK! One more! Call me "Yoshinori-sensei." YO! SHI! NO! RI! What is that? Just wait until lunchtime! I'm sorry. DAMN IT! DAMMIT! Right, they fired you. They didn't fire me, they made changes. It was done in order not to burden Yoshinori-san. He was transferred to the Elementary School. He'll be able to go back. Go back where? To the junior high. I'll go back to my previous workplace. Why are you like this? What do you mean? You're being stubborn about it. There's no way they'll let you go back when you can't see. I can! I can see with my left eye! Don't push yourself. Mum's worried too. Grandpa, let's play! Alright, alright... Come here. Alright Keisuke, goodnight! - You two as well, go to sleep! - Okay! I asked the doctor in charge. "Is it possible for both eyes to have retinal detachment?" Let's leave it to God. I looked into it too. To see if it's possible. The data that I've seen said that one in every four people are affected with retinal detachment in both eyes. So you knew. But it's all in God's hands now. It's all "if". If it's going to happen- If the right eye is affected, the left one can get easily affected too! I'm here. The children are here. Mom and dad are here for you. You're not alone. Yoshinori-sensei feared he might lose vision in his left eye too, so he would take a good look at his children every night. "I won't forget. I won't" He thought that to himself. Let's go. Okay, Keisuke. Ah, the handle. I forgot something! - Here you go. -Thank you. I'll walk with you. Miki, Rina, let's go! Okaaay! I'm sorry I'm sitting all by myself and not helping you. I'll get them from the nursery. Will you be fine? - Yeah. It's already like this, though. But then... IT'S GONE! Dear? The fear has finally become reality. The retina in his left eye had also detached. He had another surgery. Is it here? Yep! Let's go. Look, it's dad! Daddy! Dad! Miki took part in a piano contest. - Piano? - Yes, she's practicing. I told you about it, right? She made quite a lot of progress! Grandpa took it, look! A photo from the contest. So were you good? You played well, didn't you? Grandma bought it for me. I wore a princess-like dress while playing piano. Look, daddy! You can't see? I can, I can see. I can see. It's beautiful, really. It's fine, thanks. Are you sure? - Yes. - Alright guys, listen to your mum. - Okay! Be careful. Bye! Doctor... Please use my eyes to help my son. I'm fine with being blind! Please give him my eyes! I'm begging you, please! Calm down! He wasn't completely blind at that time, but he felt like giving up. "I just want to see one last time..." "One more time" He clung to the very low possibility that he might get his sight back. He changed hospitals, underwent surgeries, all in order to be able to say: "I just want to see one more time." He clung onto his wish... And put all effort into hope. That day has come. We always play together. We're friends! Thanks for the food! Rina, what is it? Hello! Rina is feverish... I don't think it's serious though. Dear? DEAR! He stared into space with eyes wide open. He was blind. Dear! Where are you going? Dear, where are you going! Honey! I can't see! Wait a second! - Stop it! - I can't see! Wait, what on earth? Stop it! Honey! Stop it! - Calm down! - I can't see! I can't see! - Come on, dear! - I can't see. - Stop it. - I CAN'T SEE! - Get yourself together! - I CAN'T SEE! LET GO! I'M BEGGING YOU! - I can't see.... - Stop it, please! I can't see... I can't. There's a wall. It'd be hard to restore your vision. There's nothing more we can do. I am really sorry, sensei. Sensei? Me, a teacher... I'm... I'm not a teacher anymore. 'Morning! I'm opening the curtains. "I can't tell the difference whether you do it or not" you can stop it. I'll be late since there's a staff meeting today. I signed the kids up for extended day care. Are you listening? Isn't it nice. - What? Isn't it nice how you can work. You can work. You can teach, how nice. Since you're awake, let's eat breakfast. I made your favourite- Yoshinori-sensei spent all his days at home, and even though he was alive, he seemed to be dead. Are you awake? I'm opening the curtains. I'm going shopping. Miki's practicing piano. Do you want me to buy something? Let's go, let's go! There are discounts on rice and toilet paper... Get ready, Rina. I don't want to go. I'm worried about dad so I'll stay. Can you stay on guard together with Teddy? Yeah. I'll be home soon, will you be alright? Ask Rina if you need something. Let's go, Keisuke. Mhm. Ah, right Your student called. "I want to meet Yoshinori-sensei," he said. - Bye! - Go safely! Let's go. Daddy... When will you be healthy? When you are, will we play together? Can you draw? Dad, when will you be okay? I'll do it! Hold him. Here. Dad! Daddy, you're bleeding! He was the saddest person in the world; he didn't want to meet or talk to others. While Yoshinori-sensei shut himself in I rang at his door. Good morning, is this Arai Yoshinori-sensei's house? Do you know him? Yoshinori-sensei. Your dad... Sir? Yoshinori-sensei? I couldn't believe it. Who...!? Mommy! Who are you? - No, I'm... I mean... Are you the student who called us earlier? Yes, I was in sensei's soccer club in junior high. Onosaki? Come in. Is that you, Onosaki? You can tell? Yes, it's me. I got married and have a baby! I remembered you, sir. You told me to visit you when I do. - That's why, I- - I'm not a teacher. What? I'm no longer a teacher. I'm sorry, Onosaki. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Let's go. It was you playing, Mayumi-sensei. This melody's pretty... What was it again? "The sun sets in the distant mountains" Could you teach me how to play it? You can play? Does "Soft kitty, warm kitty" count? In that case it may be difficult. It takes a while to learn how to play this one. Does it take you a while to do other things as well? What are you saying? What was that? What was that, I wonder. What on Earth am I saying? Excuse me! Morning. How long are you gonna stay like this? Like you're dead? How long are you going to stay in? Are you listening? Even though your student came to see you, what is this, this hole-like place? Are you listening? This cute student of yours, he came to say he got married and had a child, and you didn't even congratulate him! You said you're sorry! Are you stupid? Why did you apologize? Was it necessary? Why did you say that? You only lost your vision! It's nothing to apologize for! Show some courage in front of your student! You said it once, didn't you. When you proposed to me. "I'm a rookie." "I was born to be a teacher" "Being a teacher is so much fun." "I can do so much." "I can't even think of doing something else." Teaching is a calling! You told me all of this when you proposed! That's why, show some courage... At least be that teacher in front of your student! Get yourself together! He didn't come here to hear an apology! It all ended. What ended? It's done! I'm not a teacher! I can't be a teacher anymore! "You only lost your vision?" It's not "only!" I didn't only just lose the use of my eyes! I'm in the dark, I don't feel like I'm standing on the ground I lost my legs, my arms, MY WHOLE BODY! THAT'S HOW IT FEELS! So what? So you'll just stay shut in? What do you know? Isolating yourself, not doing anything.... You want to stay like that forever? You can see so what do you know! Aren't you ashamed of living like that? What kind of life is this... I live because I have no choice. It would be better if I died! Would be better? So you're saying you want to die? - Dying would be better! - THIS IS NOT A JOKE! Dying and leaving me and the kids is just selfish! - Selfish -Yes! Selfish! You only think what is better for you. You want to die so much, let's do it together. If you really want to, let's do it! Since dying is better than living! Let's die together! Hell, together with kids! - I'll call them and we'll do it! - ARE YOU AN IDIOT? WHO IS AN IDIOT HERE? LET ME GO! You're saying you didn't just lose your vision, right? Arms, legs... you lost your whole body. I think you're forgetting the most important thing. You forgot how to feel. You lost your heart. And can't see mine! Shut up - what do you know? What do you know about it? You can still find the heart you've lost. If you can't make yourself do it though, then it's all over! DAAAAAMN! I just came to deliver this while it's still warm. Thank you, as always. - How's mother doing? - Ah, yes, her blood pressure. There's no need to hospitalize her, so it's good. Is that so. We'll take it, thank you. You heard it, didn't you? - What? - The fight. We were in the middle of a discussion. - Right... He... Yoshinori-san... He's more than blind. He shut himself off from the world. Is he alive, or is he dead... He's emotionless. There was no answer no matter what I'd say. Right... But just now he snapped back at me. It was the first time he snapped back since he went blind, father. Right. He threw a pillow at me. The day he can fight has come. It all starts now. It all begins now. Beautiful melody. What was that song again? "The sun sets in the distant mountains" Daddy? Are you ok? Miki? You were the one playing? - Yes, she was. Here, Rina. - Miki, I bought you a pen. - Thanks! This song... It takes time to master it. All this time... They were growing up. While you shut yourself in your room, Miki took up piano, Rina learned how to ride a unicycle. Yusuke has been able to kick the football. And when something wasn't going his way, he frowned just like you. Go shave and wash your face. That's fine, come on! Wait... Why, what? I'll shave you. Raise your chin a little. Be careful. What? We'll drive. Mayumi-san left the children with a baby sitter and took Yoshinori-sensei outside. It was the first time he went outside in six months. - Where are we going? - I want you to meet someone. I had a friend in high school with whom I practice piano She moved far away after she got married though. Both of her parents are blind. Acupuncture - Nursing care? - Yes. Yes, both of us. Though recently it's been in a hospice. We worked to earn money so that our two kids could go to college. But... We're blind, both of us. For me, it was caused by an illness. In my husband's case, it was an accident. We are blind, but we're not worried about that. Yoshinori-san, you're still young. The life you've led until this point will be alright. You can be independent at work. For example, acupunture. Telephone exchange. Physiotherapist. And other things.... If you believe in yourself hard enough, new roads open before you. I'm sorry I brought you there without asking. Did it depress you? No, that was amazing. Overcoming a hurdle like that. What's wrong? You've been quiet. Why? You want to stay in again? Talk to me, please. When I proposed to you, do you remember what you said? You told me "A teacher's job is heaven sent" That's what you said. You would stay up late every day because you would plan classes for the following day. "I took this job to change the lives of my students" I fell in love with you in that moment. You made teaching your life... I love you. The couple we met today... They were so bright and cheerful, it's a good thing no matter how you look at it. But... They talked about a new road. A massage therapist? Physical therapist? In other words... I can't go back to being a teacher. So that's it? I can't do anything about going blind. And what about taking back my heart? Isn't it that, Mayumi? Putting everything into being a teacher is what you loved about me, right? My... My heart... If I can't go back to being a teacher, then I lost it forever. That's not the case! I get it. I... I just... wanted to go back. Go back to that place. I just wanted to go back. Welcome. Long time no see, since the wedding. Thanks for meeting me. Likewise. Aoi-san, aren't you from the same university as...? Yes, we were studying at the same Faculty of Education. I work for the prefecture's administration. You were singing and dancing at the reception. Ah... "LOVE Machine" Right! You sang Morning Musume by yourself while wearing a skirt... That was Yoshinori's doing! He made me do it. Please forget about it... I'm a rather serious man, it all started with him. He would always share his cheerfulness. While he was my junior, I looked up to him. How's he doing? He's at home. He's not doing much. He doesn't answer my calls. - I'm sorry about that. - No need to. I was just worried. I have friends in the Board of Education. The news about his health reached me. If I can... No, I'd be grateful if I could help. I am grateful. No matter what, senpai... I'm grateful. You know, now I'm not in the mood for meeting people. Hello? Aoi-senpai? What? Good morning, sir~ I'm sorry, but... Are you Yoshinori-san? Aoi-san has told me about you. Yes, I just talked to him on the phone... I'm Miyagi Michio. I'm going in~ Yes, yes... excuse me... Huh... - Sorry for intruding! - No, wait... You have a nice house. Not that I can see it. Miyagi-san, I have to ask you to leave- Ah, it's here, I guess. Yes, yes. - I have weak eyesight. - Weak eyesight? It gradually got worse since I was a child Now it's so bad I'm almost blind. I can't walk without my cane, and it's hard for me to read books. But now I do my job as I used to. - Job? - Yeah, I'm a teacher. - Teacher? - That's right. - So is it possible to teach? - Yeah. - And stand at the lectern!? - Sure! - Seriously? - Seriously! - Sorry. - Nope. - A kiss... - Yep. - Accidentally. - Right... - Do you have a computer? - Yes, I do. - Can I use it? - Sure, this way. This encounter finally brought light. He may be able to go back to teaching. At the end of Yoshinori-sensei's long tunnel there was a tiny ray of light. An audio PC? Do you have such a thing? Sure. You can make teaching materials. Then they're read by a volunteer. And then the textbook is expanded. Wait a second. You're not blind, - I am. - It is different. It's still an impairment, though. I wasn't the only one who's been reinstated. If you put some effort into it, you can go back to teaching. It would be amazing, to be able to get on the stand again. Let's do out best for those who'll follow us! ♪Nihon no mirai wa LOVE Machine by Morning Musume ♪ Sekai ga urayamu ♪Koi wo Is this bag okay? Everything's inside. Call me if you need anything else. - Mayumi. - Yes? Every since I lost my sight, everyday when I wake up, I think to myself: "It would be great if this was only a dream" And then I open my eyes and it's all real. I was desperate because I really can't see. Over and over again. But now... I got tired of despair. - Tired? - Yeah. No matter how depressed I am, I can't change reality. Miyagi-san said: "It's in children's interest to have contact with disabled people." "They should be taught empathy." For people like us, it's a big thing. I'll... I'll do my best. Yoshinori-sensei decided to go to a rehabilitation facility for the sake of people like him. Arai-san, my name's Sakaki. I'll be in charge of you. Let's get along. As we said earlier, this is about your life, that's why I'll be strict. O-okay. And the training was indeed truly restless and strict. It's not "I can't see so I can't do it", but rather "I can't see but I can do it." Your swinging is too wide. Narrow it down. Yoshinori-sensei was having a hard time, but not once did he complain. - I'm sorry. - Please look for it on your own. There will be times when there's no one to help you. To be able to be reinstated you need to be able to commute on your own. Too baaaad! Arai-san. I haven't done anything wrong, and yet I feel remorseful. Aren't I troublesome just by walking? Aren't I an obstacle? Don't you dare thinking that. Those youngsters were not laughing at you. They were laughing at something else. Don't let it get to you. Is it "tani?" The consonants are written in the lower right corner in the Japanese Braille. Once again go over the lower part and confirm it. Ki... Ah, it's "taki",right? Right. And next? Ki... Arai: ara as shin in shinbun; i as in idomizu. あらい 新聞の新 井戸水の井｡ This is a TTS system. It reads what you're writing. Different kanji can have the same readings, that's why it gives examples. Mayumi: ma as shin in shinjitsu, yumi as kyu in kyudou. まゆみ 真実の真 弓道の弓 Rehabilitation took one year. Finally, the dog training started. Arai-san's guide dog is called Claude. Arai-san. Claude, come. The ceremony of association with the owner is called "marriage". Yoshinori-san's guide dog was named Claude. So it all came down to a guide dog? That's right. He'll be with us every day. Must be tough. Sign here too? I'm sorry for making you help. I'll do what I can. But I'm happy, you know. I'm relieved to see him making progress step by step. He's trying to get the teaching position. He's giving is best to go back to his previous work. To being a teacher? Actually, there is a vision impaired teacher reinstated. But Yoshinori-san's not vision impaired! He's totally blind, is it even possible? And then these? - I'll do these. - Thank you. It'll be fine even if he doesn't go back to teaching. Of course I'd be happy if he could. It seems difficult, though... I was sad it wasn't me who got blind instead of him, especially when I saw how a person can change. I was sad. In so much pain... That's why I'm so happy to see Yoshinori-san doing his best to reach the goal. Every day he's doing his best to live. That's enough for me. This goal of his... is it to teach again? Probably not. The goals of marriage will always come first. No matter what happens or how awful it gets, don't just split up. Some day you'll think "ah, something like this happened" and laugh it off. I'm jealous, you know. To be able to have this mindset... I'm constantly nagging your father. I can't think that it's enough for him to just live, haha. It may be difficult. But if he has the will, there'll be a way. I really hope so. Please straighten your back a bit. Huh? Face the same direction as the dog. Right. Right. Claude. Bridge. Good job! Corner. Right. That's right! Good job! If you're not good with maps, you may not be able to work with guide dogs. It doesn't work for everyone. When you live together 24/7, you gain mutual trust. And then, there's the graduation ceremony. He overcame every obstacle, and had Claude with him. He was finally able to walk on his own. Congratulations! Thank you very much. - Thank you, thank you. - It's Sakaki. - Sakaki-san! Arai-san... No, Yoshinori-san. You did well! The frustration made you stronger! You've done the impossible! - Thank you very much. - Aren't you finishing the rehabilitation too? Yes. My heart was rehabilitated as well. You've done a lot for me. Everyone, come here! I'm home! Sit down. I'm home. Daddy! Who is it? Ah, Keisuke. Keisuke, I'm home! Rina, I'm home! So this is Miki... Miki, you've grown! I'm home. Welcome back! I'm home. You worked hard. I'm home! This guy's name is Claude. - Claude? - Yes, Claude. Even though he's a dog, he's a guide dog. He's not here to play with. Don't feed him as you please. We get it, we even wrote this down. There are rules written on the wall. Ah, right. Let's welcome the new member of our family. Yeees! Cheers! - Can I? - Yes. The rice is on the ninth. In terms of a clock. On your third, miso soup. On the eleventh, your favorite fried chicken. - Alright. - On your first, it's a salad. Potato salad! You know where tea is. Thank you. Let's eat. Delicious! Home-made meals are the best. So eat! Thanks for the food! Aoi-san has begged the Board to give Yoshinori-sensei a chance. I'm begging you for a meeting. How's he supposed to teach when he's blind? There are methods for it. I'm not backing down until you accept it. Even if he gets to teach, how do I convince the parents? I have summarized Arai Yoshinori's achievements here. No matter how many times you say it... Here's the thing... I know he can't be reinstated right away. First of all he needs training, But can he work as a teacher again? Shouldn't it be checked? He wants to see how much he can do on his own. He needs this chance! ... so he says. Please. I'm begging you. You got a job, huh. It's a trial period. I start my trial at a school for disabled students. They have conditions. During the training there must be a family member accompanying. It takes 2.5hrs one way. Someone has to wait for him while he's there, and then go back with him, which takes another 2.5hrs. And it's every day. 5 hours both ways. And you're a teacher... I'll do it. You're taking care of the grandchildren and cook. You have blood pressure problems too. So who's left? I think it's settled. Dad? Is it okay? Sure. We're heading off. - Have a safe trip! Father, thank you. - Yeah... Right. Stop. Are you okay? - What? "What..." You're a big boy now! I didn't think we'd be walking like that together since you grew up, so it's a good thing. Let's go. Go. Go. Bridge. Good! Go. - Good morning. - Good morning! - 'Morning! - Hello! Good morning. In rain and windy weather, Yoshinori-sensei's father was always with him. He never complained. His dad, who used to be so stubborn he was scary, this dad's sigh was making him sentimental, and grateful. And after a year of reinstatement training, this happened. I'm sorry. Senpai? I deeply apologize. I said it's not impossible for you to go back to teaching because of the Miyagi-sensei's precedent. That's how it went. The guys from the Board of Education are harder than I thought. It's that he's vision's impaired and I'm blind, right? That may be, too. They wouldn't talk to me at all. They're straight up rude. So about going back... It's wishful thinking. I'm sorry, truly sorry! Senpai, I should be the one apologizing. You went through so much for me. I caused you trouble. - Yoshinori... - It's fine. Thank you so much. - I'll pay. - It's fine. It should be enough. Claude, let's go home. Sit. Let's go. Senpai, excuse me. I've been under your care. Thank you. Go. Thanks, it was delicious! Thank you very much! Goodbye! - Senpai! - What is it? Please sing and dance at my wedding! Whaat? Morning Musume's "Love Machine". I would never... "Break out of your shell!" No way, no, no no way in hell! Nowadays impossible is nothing. Right, senpai? Right. Yoshinori! Senpai? Sit. Are you giving up on the job? I mean, on teaching at the lectern? Are you giving up on going back? I couldn't do that, could I? I gave up giving in. Yoshinori... It's just that troubling you even more- Stop with these blunders. I'll talk to the Board one more time. I'll talk to them as much as it's needed. You can't move administration with passion, But you can move people's feelings. I'll make you stand at the lectern again. No matter what. He said there was hope. There was this tiny light in the dark tunnel. It wouldn't have been there if he gave up. That was the time when he called me. You used to say we students were the hope. Hope. You'd believe anything you were told. We were just hot-blooded. You're right. That time... What do you think comes with hope? Love does. Love. Love comes with hope! Really, such a thing... You said it! At that time I was like: "What's with this teacher?" But then my child was born and I remembered you, sir. You taught us hope, and love, and even more invisible things. What's his name? My son's name? Tsubasa. You want him to be a soccer player. That's a great name. Claude, go. I'm happy. I thought I wouldn't see you again. I mean, you were in such a state... Yeah, that was awful. That was my worst time. I want you to continue teaching, sir. Maybe not me, but my son. I always thought how I wanted to see the day you teach my children. Ticket gate. - Good morning! - Good morning! Stop. Sit. A meeting was held. He wanted to go back to being a junior high teacher, and we wanted everyone to know he was serious. It was planned by Aoi-san, and other volunteers. My name's Aoi. Let's do this together! Please take a look! Thank you very much! - Here you go! 30 people gathered in a small public hall of the neighborhood. Then, Yoshinori-sensei himself talked from his heart. And all of you who came here today, you become my strength too. My dream is to stand at the lectern in a junior high school. It's a far-fetched dream that I'm chasing, but I'm not giving up. I'm moving forward. Thank you very much. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Thank you. Do you have a minute? We were able to conclude the meeting yesterday, And the comments of the audience are all gathered here. We've established an association of people supporting Arai Yoshinori. The mayor wants to talk to you. I was told the mayor wants to offer this blind teacher a position in his former junior high. Listen, the government is passionate about- - Senpai, relax. Got it. ♪ Japan's future is... ♪～ Wow Wow Wow Wow Why do you make me do this... But it's been fun. Alright, let's go. Yup. We were asked by the Board of Education who'll take the responsibility for him. The burden and responsibility on the school and students is huge. But there's a lot of good to it, too. Having Arai Yoshinori-sensei as a teacher will more likely add empathy to the students' upbringing. - There are things only Arai-sensei can teach and- - Can I say something? Yes I want to hear it from Arai-sensei himself. Right Why are you particular about going back to your previous school? Ah... My father said I may be subjected to bullying, that's what I was told. To be honest, I used to feel it could be the case. I felt like someone took my life away from me. But then, slowly, Very slowly, I came to accept the reality and my fate. Now it feels natural that I want to go back to my previous school. I want to meet the students. A natural feeling? That wasn't really an answer, right. I just love being a teacher. My wife went to the meeting the other day. You overcame so many hardships and went all the way up. Your story has shaken her up, and moved her to tears. I truly believe that Arai-sensei's way of living will influence our students. Arai-san! Let me take responsibility. I'll deal with the Board of Education. Thank you so much! I want you to go back to your previous school Thank you! Mayor! Yoshinori! - Good luck. - Thank you! Thank you! So how did it go? Yoshinori... Japan's future is Wow wow wow wow, aha! It went well, Mayumi-san. Right, Yoshinori? Thank you. No problem! I'm glad. Go. Go. Down. I'm your teaching assistant, Yamazaki. - Looking forward to be working with you. - Likewise. Yoshinori-sensei started preparing the lessons. Everything was handmade. - Aren't you hungry? - Ah. You can't sleep from all these nerves? I was just thinking how it's finally tomorrow. - The lectern you longed for, right. - Yeah. You've met one of my old students. Onosaki-kun? He said he'd like to see the day when I teach his child too. He says it, but his kid is still a newborn! We can only dream about the future. Now that I think about it... It's not just a dream. As long as you don't give up, sir. I believe in you. Just like you believed in us then. Sir, have you forgotten your phrase? "Teachers, you know..." Teachers, you know, are always teachers to their students. I'm glad we met. Thank you. Onosaki's son is called Tsubasa. Tsubasa - "wings" There's a great meaning to it. Yeah. My hope. I'll take a one quick look again. "Quick look"... sounds strange, right? I need to confirm something. - Can I help? Can you look into something for me? In the dictionary. - Sure. Will you be alright? Will you really be OK? I will, I'm telling you. Don't tell me dad's here too. No, he said there's no need to see you off. See? There's nothing to worry about. Good luck. The time has come, Yoshinori-san. Mother, I'm going. Good luck. I'm out. Go safely. I'm going. Go. Good luck! - I'm going! Go. - Good morning. - Good morning! Morning! - It's baaad! - What is? The new teacher is bad! - He's blind, right? - Blind? We've got a blind teacher. - You haven't heard? - Geez! Or rather, he can't see... He won't notice the mistakes! Or skipping classes! So you can slack off! And cheat? Only you can say such carefree things. What are they doing with the blind teacher... If he can't see, how's he supposed to teach us? He can't do it, can he? He may not even care about us, right? If that's the case, I'll get mad. I heard there's a teaching assistant. There's a supplementary teacher too, right? How are they supposed to recognize us? Good morning, go to your seats. Make sure you're sitting by your desks. Hurry up! Go. Door. Go. Down. Good morning. Good morning! Starting today I'm your homeroom teacher. First of all, I have an important thing to tell you. For example, there are people in this class who wear glasses, right? Even though I'm wearing them too, I can't see the blackboard. Not just the blackboard, I can't see anything. Like with glasses... Or rather instead of glasses, I need another person to help me see. That is Claude, a guide dog. Claude is not a pet. He's a guide dog and he's here to work. He's working now, so please don't disturb him. Let's make it a promise, please. Now- excuse me. Here comes the stress, huh. Will everyone accept me? I wonder what face they'll make when they see me. I can't see their faces after all... You can see them. If it comes to you, you can see them. See? You can see me. And it's not only me. The kids, your parents, Aoi-senpai... Onosaki-kun, Miyagi-san... And a whole lot of other people who've been supporting you and helping you and giving you strength, and lots of love. Can you see them? Respond to this love by standing at the lectern once again. What was phrase that you kept saying? People like you give teaching a greater meaning. Show them you're right. Time for my introduction. Seriously? My name's Arai Yoshinori. Let's get along! Call me "Yoshinori-sensei." YO! SHI! NO! RI! Yay! Right. Now I'd like to check the attendance by reading out your names. I'll record your voices. Please respond with "here." Your voice will be the key to recognizing you. So... - Aida Kyosuke-kun. - What? Why did you know? You're not really blind, right? - Seriously. - Quiet! - Aida-kun. - Here... Here! Here. - Ikawa Yuki-kun. - Here! He learned his students' names by marking their desks and memorizing their voices. - Toda Mitsuru-kun. - Here! Alright! Are you OK? Let's get along throughout the year! Looking forward to it, Yoshinori-sensei! Yoshinori-sensei! Yo! Shi! No! Ri! Yay! That was the birth of the Blind Teacher Yoshinori. He took a step into his new life. - Good morning. - 'Morning! Good morning, Yoshinori-sensei! - Hello. - Good morning! - Freshmen, huh? Feels good to hear new voices. A nightingale is singing. The warblers practice in fields and go back to the mountains. It's called "low chirping". They're like the freshmen. - This smell... - Cherry trees. Ah, they're blooming... How is it? What color? They're turning pink! And the darker shades, too. They spread widely. That's pretty. It's full bloom. Let's go. Claude, go. - Is your club doing well? - It's great! I shot a goal yesterday! - Good morning, sir! - Morning! - We won't lose as long as I'm on the team.
