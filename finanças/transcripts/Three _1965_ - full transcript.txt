Those were the days of collapse and chaos. Is it coming? I can't hear a thing? - How about you, Milovan? Nothing. Do you know will the train come? - It is forbidden to stand here! And you, conscript, to your place! Right now! The chief is coming! - Watch that elbow! - Look at him, a dandy! A gentelman, of course! Not a peasant, like some! Get back, you bastards! Push them back! Will they come? - Where are the Germans? Give room! You'll smother this woman! - Could it be they've blown up the bridge? Shut up, you old man! - Old man? And what would you be? A girl! They called... It's coming! What is it? What are you staring at? Pull back, you animals! Go back!! Hey friend! Bring that she-bear here! Let her show us what she can do. Come, there is a client. They're leaving us, like we're nothing! Quiet! Don't talk against the Army! - Screw that! This is a treason! Did you see this? The Army left. What about us? - Ask the cop! - Where is he? - Rats! Running away. There is another one coming. Probably! Brothers, he is pulling our legs! - He has no clue. Repent! Repent! Repent! Where are you Zeko? Say something. We were just waiting for you! Zeko, you're getting the hell out too? - Are you travelling first or second class? They'll give you anything you want. Don't you worry. Come on, Zeko, bring some order here! - Who can do it, if not you? Repent! May Our Father bring you peace and happiness, amen! 'And people were thirsty for water...' - I tell you, a whole car empty Get lost Zeko! - Stop dragging yourself around here! The cop slipped away! - All gone! The Germans will take it any moment! - Brothers, let's ransack it! I'll have some for the Air Force. - Skyhawks! Come on! - Let me go! Long live Air Force! - It's good stuff. - Sure it is! It's not moonshine! Folks, let me get one canister too! I'm very poor! - Shut up! Don't yell! There some for me too! Why are you showing off? - You were once peasants too! Bring order at the battlefield, not here! - We are military police... ... this area is under court marshal. - Then the Germans will take it. Germans? Like hell! The Gen. HQ is in the spa. The front is ahead of us. That is true. Anything else is misinformation. - The fifth column, I knew it! That's the Army! Quick to make order! - Why do they call you Peta? What about us? What should we do? - You? And who is 'you'? Us, conscripts. What are you waiting for? Get in line! Quickly! Quickly in line! It's an order! Right by the wire, bro! And in broad daylight! He tapped into the Gen. HQ line. - And? Well, no need for a trial... shot right at the scene of the crime. Your ID. Yes, you! - Me? Why me, of all people! - Identification. You too. Your ID. Name? - It says there. - I know. I want to check! ID! Name? - Milos Bojanic. Occupation? - Student. ID! - Don't have any. Don't have anything. How is that? - Everything burned... The house was bombed, and I... I ran away from Belgrade. Everyone has a little story. You are one of those... ... colaborators. - His 'r' is very strange? Serbs do not speak like that. - That's how I talk since I was born. Everyone was born once. Tell us who are you? I'm a journalist. - He's lying! He has a camera! That is my profession. - Profession? A ruse for spying! That's where the money is. - A spy makes lots of money. - Just shoot him! We once lost Kosovo because of people like him. My wife and child are here too. - Where are they? Vera! Quiet down! Let's us check. Call her once more. Does anyone know him? - Nobody. - Where is your wife? Here somewhere. - Will they do him right now? - Where? We should wait for his wife. - Who said that! I did. - You student, shut up! - A student... I spotted him a while ago. Spoke to him but he kept quiet. You can't just do it like that - kill a man without a trial. This is war. It's court marshal now. Could you be one of them too? Fifth column! Fifth column! They got one more of them! Quiet!! We are the law here! Wait, where are you taking me? Please tell me! Please tell me where are you taking me! Tell me please... - Quickly... Wait, let me tell you please... What is.... What just happened? They killed the man! And us? - Who 'you'? What 'you'? Us conscripts. - Get lost!! Dismissed. Please... my husband... he wears a beret... ...he has a camera... He was supposed to wait for me here. Put your hands behind your head. Don't move! Throw away your gun! Throw your gun!! Have no fear, comrade. It's empty. Even if it was loaded, it could not kill you. I thought.... But where is your cap? Lost in the bush. Where have you been? - I was left here under a slab. - Alone? Germans surrounded us. They battered the graveyard with cannonfire. I was wounded. I couldn't walk. Ours should have been back a few days ago. All dead? - For sure. Germans are everywhere! - I know. - We have to find a way to the sea. Ours are there. It will be easier together. Give me those hand granates and run away! I'll be OK, don't worry! I'll catch up with you. I want to confide something. But don't tell this to anyone. Don't worry. - I'm afraid. Not now though. Now we are together. In that hole, under the slab... I was alone, all alone, for ten days... I thought I'd go crazy. You despise me? Give me a break! I've been running away like a wild animal for days now. I've been going wild... eating roots... I'd do anything to reach the sea. Have you forgotten? - What? - You know what. I did. - I was really afraid. Don't worry. No one will know. I was alone. I'm not a coward. I want you to know. This marsh is the only thing left. We'll get through it! Hurry! We'll make it. The sea is behind the marsh. Can you dive? - Yes I can. I don't even know your name. Don't need to. You're everything to me know. And you to me. Come on, frogie. Let's hurry. We have to reach the sea. Hurry! We're surrounded. - Those are the same ones that are afer me. We have to split. One of us may slip through. Why should we both die? One is enough. Don't worry. I'm not scared any more. One of us will make it. Remember me! Will you? I'll remember you. We'll make it alive. Both of us. Oh life!!! Report During the reporting period, our unit.... What is it comrade? Learning? - War is ending. Figure I'd need it. Report After tough battles and... an ardous march... our unit.... Can I use your typewritter? I haven't finished the report yet... ...nevermind, you take it. I'll continue later. Who are these people? - Scum. We'll shoot them all before dark. All of them for execution? - Mostly. Are you sure? I'll interrogate them. I might let some go, too. Why so quickly, before dark? We have to get it done. Someone might escape. We're building a state, and don't even have a prison. You better go to Valjevo. - Why? - No reason. I have not finished my report yet. I'll interrogate them downstairs. Will return the typewritter when I'm done. You gave me one already. - You left it downstairs... forgotten it... A melon is a mellow fruit. What will happen to them? - To whom? - To those in the courtyard. The guilty will be punished. - How do you know who's guilty? We'll find out. There is evidence. Do you pull weeds out of the crop field? We do. But we're always sure about what is weed. We know too. - What about the girl? Don't know. Will be interrogated. Can I give her some melon? You can. - So she is going to be alright? Don't know. Will be interrogated. I gave her some melon. - I know. I told her that you allowed it. You shouldn't have said that. - Why? - No reason. Nobody got any food since morning, just some boiled corn. It's not my decision. She's young. She can change. How do you know? - I'm sure she would. Enough with that. Go now. Here it the typewritter. You can continue with your report. You know that Russians are at Prahovo? - I heard about it. I got tired. You can't imagine what type of business that is. You already gave orders? - It's all here. The girl? A clear case. Gestapo. I overheard the guards: 'She's a woman. They'll let her go.' Protectionism is the worst, especially in the beginning. Here is a photograph... ...with major Stern, a local German from Panchevo... Before the war, he was a supervisor at her father's... ...and during the war, daddy's girl became his assistant and lover. She was caught with him. We got them on the road to Ralja. Come with me to the town. We'll be back in a couple of hours. I haven't finished my report. - We'll go to a real coffee house... ...have a coffee... papers hanging in reading clips... I can't. - Bye. - THE END - subtitles by quequetz
