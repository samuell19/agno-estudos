♪ - Live from radio city music hall, please welcome Brian Regan! ♪ - Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Thanks. That is a huge honor. I cannot thank you enough. I really appreciate it. - New York City! It's the only city in the world where people say, "Please tell me the Pope is gone." Yeah, I don't know, man. New Yorkers. If you get in an elevator anywhere else in the world, people press lobby. You get in an elevator in New York City, people press lobby, door close, door close, door close, door close, door close, door close, door close, door close, door close. And if you'd never seen that button, it's the one completely worn away. I'm trying to take care of myself. I just had my annual physical. Hey. Alright. Thank you. I'm just going to do set ups the whole show. And I like to drive... You guys are great, man. I went to a new doctor. New doctor for me. You ever go to a brand-new doctor, and the moment he walks in, you're like...no? No, this ain't going to work out. I need an air vent or something I can crawl through to safety. I was sitting there. I'm nervous enough. Doctor walks in. All the buttons on his lab coat were off by one. If he can't nail that task... I don't think I want his doctor paws on me. I know this is going to sound like I'm making this up. This is the absolute truth: he was late. I don't get that. I don't get why it's okay for the doctor to be late. If I have a 2:00 appointment, I want the doctor looking at me at 2:00. And the only way... the only way I think it would be okay for the doctor to be late is if at 5 of 2:00 you're in the waiting room and you notice from under the door that leads to the back rooms... a pool of blood. An ever-widening pool of blood coming out into the waiting room, and everyone has to lift their feet. I think we might be delayed. Then it would be okay... for him to be five minutes late. Clamp whatever's doing that and get me back there. I want to hear a clamp noise and him saying, "My 2:00 is here." But I need, you know, I need somebody to look after me like that, 'cause I'm not paying enough attention to myself. I swear... I looked in the mirror the other day, and I noticed a two-inch hair growing out dead center from the middle of my forehead. What the hell? How's that even possible? All the other hairs are up here. How does one hair do a lone wolf? We're doing a jail break. I know it was two inches 'cause I measured it. Now, I don't know how long it takes for a hair to grow two inches, but nobody in my life bothered to tell me about it for the entire growing season. They must have had daily conversations. Has he noticed yet? He has not. How is that possible? I don't know. He must look directly into the mirror, and the hair must be perfectly straight. And he must not move his head a billionth of an inch. He is unaware of his uni-hair. Not cool. I'm trying to be cool. I'm thinking of getting a tattoo. But I want to get a tattoo that's unique, you know? I don't want a tattoo like everybody else. So I want to get a tattoo of a blender. A big one on my chest, you know? Then when I go to the public pool and take my shirt off, everybody will be spellbound. They'd be, like... I-i-is that a blender? Born to frappe. I have unusual tattoo ideas. I think someone should get a tattoo of a dozen Easter eggs but tell the tattoo artist to hide them. You get back in shape, you might find a golden egg. I'm no one to talk, man. I lost ten pounds for this thing, and then... Oh, thanks. And then yesterday they told me television adds ten pounds. So basically I just wasted my time for a couple months. I don't understand nutrition. I heard a nutritionist on the radio saying something like you should eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper. But I think I wrote it down wrong. 'Cause I eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a hippopotamus, and dinner like an 800-pound gorilla and a midnight snack like a 25-ton humpback whale. When I was jotting it, I inverted something. I'm always inverting my jots. People who know me say that about me. You get weird advice about food. Whenever I go to the store, people say, Brian, you don't want to go grocery shopping when you're hungry because you'll end up buying the kind of food you wanna eat when you're hungry. I don't know how to function. Brian, you don't want to go buy a car when you want to buy a car 'cause you'll end up buying the kind of car you want to get when you want to buy a car. Can you imagine driving home in a car like that? Filled with the kind of groceries you want to eat? You'd be the laughingstock of the cul-de-sac. I'm trying, man. I got a juicer. I got a big, giant juicer. You put the fruit or vegetable in the hole in the middle beside the spout... that's...for the juice. I'm not sure why I'm explaining to you how a juicer works. Yeah, we get it, chuckles. This side's the bad side. You don't want anything that goes in that direction. First thing I tried to make... This is true... Was banana juice. Not realizing a banana has about 0% moisture. How would I know? I took the manual, tossed that right in the trash. Peeled a banana... This is the first thing I put in this machine. Vuuuuuaaaaahhh! Okay, clearly there's a lag time here. Second ban... Vuuuaaaahhhh! Oh, you have to be patient! Okay. I thought maybe that's how juicers work. Maybe it takes a while for the machine to catch up, so I just kept pumping bananas in. Seven in a row. Vuuuaaaahhhhh! When does that delicious banana nectar start trickling into this glass? So I just took the lid off, and I started eating the banana pulp. Mmm... Which is very similar to eating a banana. It's like eating a banana without all the hard work. I don't know. The way people talk about food intrigues me. Turkey leg. Chicken leg. But when it comes to lamb, leg gets front loaded for some reason. I've never understood why. What is tonight's special? Oh, ha ha ho... tonight's special... is leg of lamb! Oh, lamb leg! I don't think you understand the magnitude of this. What's so special about their legs? So I started with some wings of chicken. And why is the catch of the day always fish? Don't they have to catch all the animals? What is the catch of the day? The catch of the day... is cow. You'd think they'd be easy to catch, but... this one knew something was up. He had these little juke moves. It was almost as if he didn't want to be slaughtered. I was at a restaurant once... The catch of the day was escargot. I saw this guy back in the kitchen... It was a fancy restaurant. I like fancy restaurants, 'cause no matter what you order, they compliment your choice. You get to feel good about yourself for a moment. What are you going to be dining on this evening, sir? I was going to have a hamburger. Excellent choice. Well, buckle up, 'cause I'm not finished. 'S a dinner party, man. I'm trying to go to more parties. I'm not good at them. I'm not good at talking to people. Which might sound weird in this setting. I can handle this for some reason, but parties aren't set up like this. I don't show up at parties and people go, "All right, we'll all get over here, and you get over there." Parties... People are all around you. What are you doing back there? What are you up to? What's your quest? Plus, with a small group, I never know when a conversation's over. You know? When is it okay to walk away from people? Is he still talking back there? Is he making any more sense than when he started? I'll give you an idea of how awkward I am at parties. This is a true story. I'm at one, and there's a guy there whose name I should know, but I don't know it. But I keep thinking it's Winston, you know, which is not the kind of name you want to gamble at. It's a big roll of the dice. Hey, Winston! It's Beauregard. All right, see y'all later! Tell Winston I said hi if he ever shows up. So this is true. I grabbed another friend of mine at the party and I said, "I have a weird assignment for you. "I want you to just for a second "pretend like your name is Winston. "All right, you see that guy there? "I want you to walk to the other side of that guy, "but in a straight line past him "so I'm just looking in one direction, "and then I'm going to go, 'Hey, Winston!' "And if the guy in the middle goes, 'Yeah,' "then you just walk away. "Your assignment is complete at that point. "But if the guy in the middle looks like he's confused, "I need you to go, 'Yeah.' And then I'll talk to you again, I guess." I didn't plan that far ahead. So my friend thinks I'm twisty and he's like, "All right, let's do this." He walks to the other side of the guy. So I go, "Hey, Winston!" An the guy in the middle looks like he's confused, so I look at my friend, and he says, "My name's Winston." Yeah, terrific. I was looking for any random Winston. Your name's Winston? Come on over. Let's have a chat. I'm in the mood to talk to a Winston. In a little while, I'll be wanting to speak with a Gwendolyn. If that's your name, get ready. I'll be making the announcement shortly. Had one line, and he blew it. His line was, "Yeah?" That's all he had to yellow highlight. So I'm at this party, and I'm trying to mingle around, you know? Whatever happened to handshakes? Didn't those work okay? This guy walks up to me and he's like... Eh? Eh...eh-eh! Eh? Eh? I'm like, I don't know how to participate... in your bizarre greeting ritual. Then I realized, oh, he's shadowboxing. He's showing me something important from his world. So I realize, well, I should probably reply in kind, so I did some shadow polo. Slow moving horse. That's the world we're in. You got to think on your feet during greetings, you know? Another guy walked up and just said "Homes." So I said, "Elementary, my dear Watson." I thought, hey, people are coming up to me to say hi. You know, maybe I should go up and say hello to somebody. I thought, well, obviously handshakes are old-school. Nobody's doing that. So what should I do? I thought, oh, I'll chest bump somebody. So I was in midair... and I don't think this lady realized... I'm simply coming over to say hello. I got too much lift. She didn't jump at all. My shins hit her shoulders. I'm flipping. I crash through the stained glass window. You can't make this stuff up! I was trying to court her. That's how I court the ladies. I leapfrog unilaterally over the... in front of them, and I let my shins clip their shoulders. And then I...flip. They don't know what to do. They're like, ahh... Their heart's all aflutter. Ahh... I hear 'em. I hear 'em. Back in that world, man. I went through a break-up. People say, "What happened? What led to the break-up? Was it a big thing?" I don't know. Depends how you look at it. We couldn't agree on the definition of "this" exit and "next" exit. I was driving. She said, "Okay, get off at the next exit." So I pulled off. Why did you get off here? I just told to you to get off at the next exit. I thought we could get off here and buy a dictionary. Look through it. Look at words and definitions and such. It's fun to find out word meanings. So I dropped her off at the next exit. Am I understanding it correctly? You ever have a friend use a word that's so awkward you consider dropping them as a friend? Like cinema. We had this couple over. They kept using that word like it was a normal word for people to use. My wife and I like to attend the cinema. We went to the cinema Friday evening, and we usually attend the cinema a couple of times a month. Do you enjoy the cinema? Can you get out of my house? 'Cause we's all going to the movies. Another word like that is catsup. That word is dangling from a thread. We have these distant relatives over. My kids were with me, and someone said, "Would someone please pass the catsup?" It was a show stopper. I had to huddle up with my kids. He means ketchup. Pass that. Don't worry, you're never going to have to see them again. You're not allowed to hear those words in this house. Some words only some people are allowed to use. Other people aren't allowed to use certain words. Like mansion. The only people who are allowed to use that word are people who don't live inside one. It always has to be about someone else's house. Have you seen where they live? They live in a mansion! People in it are disqualified from ever calling it that. No one's ever allowed to say, "Well, things seem to be winding down here at the restaurant. "I have an idea. "Why don't we all head back to my mansion? "You won't need directions. You'll see it. It looks down upon all your homes." I think people have delusions of grandeur about their own homes. What in the hell is an infinity edged pool? Are people trying to fool their houseguests? Why, Harry... Why, where does your pool end? Well, for all you know... it never ends. We had houseguests last week. One went swimming laps. We ain't seen him since. He's stuck somewhere out in the middle of infinity. For an infinity edged pool to work, don't you have to live on the ocean? Or maybe a lake so it blends in? Otherwise it's like, man, your pool looks like it goes right into that chain link fence! I was on a swim team as a kid. Got a sixth-place ribbon one week. I like sports. I like when a sport ends with a best of seven series, you know? Then I get to hear my favorite sports reporter question. Would you consider this a must-win game? They always feel like they have to say yes. Yeah, we want to win it. It's very important to have momentum. We have our uniforms on anyway. Might as well try. They turned all these lights on. Might as well put some effort into this. But it's not always the right answer, man. It's a math question. I wish they would answer that honestly. It's a best of seven. You're down one game to nothin'. Would you consider this a must-win game? No. No, we can lose tonight. We can lose tomorrow night too. We don't want to, but that wasn't your question. You asked if it was a must-win game, and if you had ever taken a rudimentary math class, you'd already know the magic number's three. When you're down three, then you must win them or you're out. I also don't like... Hey, thanks. I also don't like when they force answers on players. Are you dedicating this game to your dying grandmother? Well, I guess now I am. I didn't even know she was sick. The winning team always gives the losing team a lot of credit. You got to give them a lot of credit. They came to play. They got a good team over there. They should hold their heads up high. If we weren't perfect, I don't know if we would have won this game. They got a good squad and a good system. We got to give them a lot of credit. I wonder if that news ever gets to the loser's locker room. Great news, fellows! I just came from the winner's locker room. I am not making this up. They are giving you... a lot of credit. I was just there. I got here as quickly as I could. But it was hard with the balloons and the confetti... and all the champagne in my eyes. I was bouncing off walls. You're getting a lot of credit for their championship. And they're inviting all of you to come over and kiss their rings. I'd like to own a second NBA team in Miami, Florida. I'm from there. The only reason I'd like to do it is to do the press conferences when they say, "Well, what's the name of your team?" And I would say, "Well, it's not the Heat. It's the Humidity." Then I would sell the team right after the press conference and... be talked about for several days. Being from Miami, I don't know a lot about winter sports, but I was watching women's curling one night. I turned it on late, so I missed the explanation... as to what they were trying to accomplish. But I think I picked that up from watching. This one woman, she skates slowly... and she's holding on to that weird round rock with a handle on it, and she has a look in her eyes... I'm not sure, but I think if a bird flew in front, it would burst in flames. It's the most intent glare a human being is capable of conjuring up. So she skates for a while, then she does this with her hand. And then eight women scream at the top of their lungs for two minutes straight. It's quite relaxing. It's sort of like watching "The View." I like "The View." I like the women on "The View." I just want to hear them one at a time. It's hard to pierce through the cacophony. All right, guys. You're great. We're going take a couple second break here! Okay. We're back. That didn't seem like four minutes. You guys are wonderful, man. Talking about TV. I watch weird shows, man. There's one I'm trying to understand. It's about moonshiners. Reality show. I don't get it. There's a guy hiding out in the woods trying to make moonshine. I don't understand the premise. Liquor is legal. What's he doing hiding behind trees? Whoo-hoo-hoo! Don't tell anybody I'm out here! Why are you out here? I'm making moonshine. Whoo! You want some? No, I can get Jack Daniel's over at the liquor store. It's legal. Has been for a while. Come out of the woods and read a newspaper. Of course, our TVs are now filled up with election stuff. I don't know why anyone would ever want to be the President of the United States. I wouldn't want that job in a million years. Can you imagine being awakened every morning like this? Problems. All kinds of problems. But people are seeking it out. People I've never seen before. Behind podiums. And the very first thing they say, I'm already confused. I'm forming a presidential exploratory committee. Oh, are you? What the hell is that? Is that committee going to come back with information that guy wasn't aware of? Okay. Here's what we found out. It's a four-year job. Four years? Yeah, and you got to be in charge of everything. Well, I don't want to do that. It's a good thing you sent us out first. We met Lewis and Clark out on our expedition. Speaking of important jobs, we had the Pope here in town, of course, right? You know who I'm curious about? The previous pope who just quit. That's kind of weird. I wonder what he's doing. Is he trying to get another job? That would be an interesting resume. You know, he hands it to the guy, and he's like... You tell him we're not hiring. And the pope prior to that pope they're making a saint. I was reading about sainthood to see what the requirements are. See if I'm on the right track. One of the requirements is you have to perform two miracles. I can sort of do that thing where you put your two index fingers together, and then you look off in the distance and you can see, like, a floating sausage. You have to relax your eyes. Relax your eyes. Okay, so that's one. And then I hit them with my rubber pencil illusion. Well, doesn't that look like it's made out of rubber? I've had some weird jobs, man. My first job ever was a dishwasher at the International House of Pancakes. It's a true story. I was, like, 14 years old. After three months the owner took me aside and said, "I'm promoting you today to busboy," and he said to me, "Please don't talk to any of the customers." I don't know what I sounded like in the dish room that he felt he had to protect his customers from, but he was adamant. He said, "I've heard the kind of things your brain comes up with. Please just let these people enjoy their pancakes." So I said okay. I bussed my very first table. I was walking back to the dish room, and I passed a woman sitting by herself eating a salad. It was lunchtime. As I was walking by, she said, "Excuse me." What am I supposed to do now? I'm not allowed to talk to anybody! I thought, she's stopping me. I better stop, you know? So I put my tray down on another table and I said, "Yes, ma'am?" She said, "There is a hair in this salad." Now, I'm from a family of eight kids. A hair in a salad don't stop nobody. It's like trivia. Hey, there's a hair. Hey, look, there's a bug. Keep chowing. You don't when the next food's coming. So I know this sounds ridiculous, but I had no idea why she was even telling me this. So I was, like, oh, okay. So I thought I'd be funny... and I said, "Well, there are no prizes or anything." Go get the owner. So now I had to go get the owner who just five minutes ago... told me not to talk to anybody. And I had to say, "I was just talking to this woman, and she's kind of upset and she wants to talk to you." He's looking at me like how is this even humanly possible? We walk out to her table, and she says, "I just told this young man "that there was a hair in my salad, and he told me that there are no prizes or anything." So he looks at me... and he looks at her and he said, "He's right... there are no prizes or anything." The best boss in the history of bosses. The lengths some people go through to not work amazes me. I also worked in a toy store putting together bicycles, and my co-worker came up to me one day and he said, "I found a place we can go hide where we don't have to put together bicycles." What's going to happen later when no bicycles are put together? He's like, "I don't know. We'll figure that out later." So I said okay. So I followed him. There's a rack of bikes in the back of the toy store. Behind that was a wall, and we're walking behind between the bikes and the wall. Gets worse. There's a hole in the drywall in the wall, and he crawls into the hole and says, "Follow me." So, like Alice in Wonderland... So he starts shimmying that way, and I'm following him. We get about eight feet in, and we're both just standing there. And he says, "Beats working, huh?" Kind of a toss-up. So I do this now. Crawled out of the hole and became a stand-up. You know, there's another Brian Regan in show business. Its a true story. He's a screenwriter, and he's really good. He wrote "102 Dalmatians" and "How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days" and all these other good movies. I didn't know about him. I was out on the road and these people said, "You wanna do a local TV interview?" And I'm like, yeah. That sounds good. They say, "We want to do it out in front of the movie theater." I'm, like, okay. Wherever. Wherever you want to do it. Yeah. We want to have "102 Dalmatians" logo behind us during the interview. Okay. Does that look good on camera or something? So we're sitting in the little wooden chairs and he goes, "So tell me about the movie '102 Dalmatians.'" You know, that's a lot of dogs jumping around. You know it's going to be fun. How will "102 Dalmatians" be different from "101 Dalmatians"? I'm not a math expert. I'm going to guess three dogs. I'm behind on my movies. I just saw the latest "Godzilla." The guy who's doing the voice for Godzilla, man, that guy's on his game. I was wondering when he was learning his lines like if he would run lines with his wife or girlfriend, you know? Hey, honey, I got that Godzilla part. Yeah, I got it. Hey, would you practice lines with me? Oh, yeah, sure. Um...oh, no. Here comes the scary monster. Aah! Well, now... I did a little voiceover work. If you're interested in voiceover work, here's how it happens. You get a voiceover agent. He sends you out on an audition. You do the audition. You wait a few days, and he calls you to tell you they gave it to Morgan Freeman. Getting back to the presidential stuff. We need somebody to get the economy going, man. I don't know what happened with it. The mortgage meltdown? I don't know how that happened. But I have a friend who knows. I have a friend who works in the grocery store in the produce department. And when he's stacking melons, he solves financial crises and... shares his solutions with us. So he came up to me one day. Brian, want me to tell you how the mortgage meltdown happened? Would you? Would you 'splain it at me? I'd be happy to. Here, sit in your booster seat. Okay, you have a mortgage, right? Right. You pay your mortgage to the bank, right? Right. They bundle those with other risky securities and sell those to speculators, right? Do I still get a lollypop? I feel like someone's explaining a magic trick to me. I put your quarter in my hand, right? Right. I close it, right? Right. It's gone. You understand? So I ain't got a quarter no more? Exactly. Hey, is there a cash register left... just one where you can buy something and immediately walk out the door... without dealing with this whole thing... Do you have a rewards card? Um...no... and I'm begging you that this be the end of this conversation. I-I have money... which says legal tender on it, and I have the amount it says on that tag. If I could just give you the money, and you release the item... We could do it simultaneously if you need Indiana Jones Style, 'cause I can see the door. I'm so close. Sunlight's streaming in. I'm hearing birds chirping. Please release me back into a world of joy. I'm not allowed to do that. I'm required to turn this into a hostage situation. Tell you about our rewards card program. You're going to love listening to every word of this. First of all, it's very easy to get one. I pull a clipboard out from under the counter while people wait in line behind us, and I get so much information from you your brain will quiver and quake. I'm going to get your home address, your work information, home number, work number, cell number, primary e-mail address, and a secondary e-mail address. Make sure you fill out the secondary e-mail address portion of the application in case we send out an e-mail blast for 5 cents off on one of our items. If that gets bounced back from the primary, if you filled out the secondary... Basically it's for your protection so you're not missing out on these life-altering financial opportunities. And if you join today, get 10% off your initial purchase and 5% off each subsequent... Subsequent... subse... On your future purchases. Do you have a full price card where people pay full price? They walk out the door and they get to watch their children grow up? I want to be with them. I want to watch my kids play soccer. I don't want to stand next to cash registers saving hypothetical nickels for the rest of my life. It's a marketing thing. There's a lot of marketing things that work. I don't know why they work, you know? The free DVD? People still respond to this? And if you act now, it comes with a free DVD! Oh ho ho. Has anyone ever wanted to watch any of these? You ever been over to somebody's house? You want to watch a DVD? Yeah! Yeah. That sounds good. What do you have? Well... I got reverse mortgages. Oh, no. No, no. No, I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't do that. Do you have any other DVDs? Well... I got "How to Grow Tomatoes Upside-down." Nah, I've already seen that one. Do you have any mysteries, you know, anything with a surprise ending? Ohh... I got the retractable awning. This one, it starts, they're all out in the sweltering sun, and, um... Hmm. Well, I don't want to give it away. I don't understand. There's a lot of things I don't understand. I don't understand dancing. I don't know who thought of it or why. What two people were standing across from each other... So should we just stand here like this or, um... Or should we stand here like this? Can you run both options past me again? Weighing the pros and cons. I don't know how to get to that weird end result. You know? How do you get there? You got to be careful. I've seen people do it. You go to a place, everyone's on the dance floor going full tilt. And everybody else is way over here not dancing at all. The only way to get from here to there is you have to ramp up the percentages. When people decide to dance, they dance just 10% near their table just to get a kick-start. You know? It's just like... Basically they're walking. There's just a little flick at the end of the extremities. Just a little indication that something's about to go down. And then the percentages gradually morph until you hit full "China Syndrome" meltdown. It has to be gradual. You can't not dance at all until you're in the middle. I'm very anal, and I refuse to dance until I am dead center... Here we go! Clearly too jarring for everyone concerned. One thing I found out about dance floors, those are the squares on this planet where it is most difficult for me to have a natural smile. You having fun, Brian? I am. I'm enjoying being on this lit-up square. I don't know how to do it, man. I don't know how to dance. My body doesn't know what to do. My brain doesn't know what signals to send. All synapses are misfiring. Frankenstein beat me once in a dance contest. So the only way I can get through it is I have to give myself assignments from the back of my head while I'm out there. Hey, move around a little bit. What, are you goin' for a walk? Head back where you were. You told me to do that. Do something with your arms. You look like you're floating. Put them down. Put them down. That was your suggestion. People say you should move your hips. Move your hips a little bit. Stop that immediately. Stop that immediately. Remember that moment. Don't ever do that again. Red alert. Danger, Will Robinson! I like music, man. That's why I like to go to the airport early, you know? They always play great music. They always have unbelievable sound systems. You get there early, you take advantage of that. You just jam to the best music known to man. Occasionally there's an announcement, but other than that, you're just getting into the music, you know? ♪ Yesterday all my... Would the gentleman who left the briefcase at the security of concourse C please return to claim your briefcase? ♪ And it seems like... All unattended vehicles will be towed away at the owner's expense. ♪ Oh, I believe... There's been a gate change for flight 207. It'll now be departing out of gate 19. ♪ Yesterday I love that song. Takes my mind off traveling. I travel a lot. I'm in a lot of hotels. I think hotels had a secret meeting recently. It was a very short meeting. Everyone flew in, and they said, everybody here? All right, very quick... We're not going to own any mistakes anymore. Alright, that's it. Head on back. How you doing? This key you gave me... I just tried it in my door. It's not working. Did you put it next to anything magnetic? No, you just gave it to me, and I just tried it. I just came back. I was expecting a good key and an apology. And I'm holding a bad key and getting an accusation. Is that the way it shakes out these days? Did you put the key next to anything magnetic? Oh, oh... I am a red Horseshoe Magnet salesman. Okay. Okay. I know what happened now. I remember you gave me that perfectly good key, and I tossed that into my bag of samples. Then I scooped that up all haphazard-like... and started swinging everything asunder. I remember hearing zippin' and zappin'. Was that the key becoming demagnetized? I'm sorry. I owe you an apology. Should I get on my knees and beg for forgiveness? If there's a problem with the reservation, they'll make it your fault every time. How are you doing? I have a reservation for a room. I got up early, and I called and confirmed the reservation. When I got to the airport, our first leg was going to be delayed, so I called from the airport to confirm the reservation. And they put us on a flight that got diverted for mechanical reasons, so I called from that airport to confirm the reservation. And they finally put us a rickety shuttle bus that ran out of gas like three miles from here. I had one bar left on my cell phone. I used it to call you... to confirm the reservation. I've been crawling on asphalt and broken glass. I just want to get in my room and get some bandages on my asphalt burns. But fortunately, I have a reservation that I've confirmed a number of times under Regan. Did you by chance make the reservation under another name? Okay. Here we go. Okay. And why would I have done that? Why, sir, would anyone do that? Has anyone ever done that in history of making hotel reservations? You don't think it's insulting that you're suggesting when name came up that's when I went off the rails? That's what you're tossing into the air... Someone on your side said name, and I panicked at that point. I don't know my name! Let's just figure it out when I eventually wander in. Is that your hypothesis of how this went awry? The customer is always wrong. So I have my reply I like to go into now. Did you by chance make the reservation under another name? Um... check Zippity Doo Dah. Sometimes I think my name is Zippity Doo Dah, and I mistakenly make my hotel reservation under that. So type it in as two names. Zippity DooDah... type it in. DooDah is the last name. I think. Oddly, when I'm making hotel reservations, and Zippity is what I incorrectly think my first name is. So type it in as the two names. You don't have that? Try Zip as the first name, Itty as the second name. Sometimes I think my name is Zip Itty DooDah, and I break it into three words even though phonetically none of them have anything to do with my actual name. When I'm making hotel reservations, I tend to panic, and it's very difficult for me to conjure up what my own name actually is. So I tend to grasp at straws, and I often settle on Zip Itty DooDah. Type it into the computer reservation system. No, I know there are people waiting, but this is your idea, and I like it... Let's take it to the end. No. No, no, no. You took this horse out of the barn. We're going to ride it, see where it takes us. No, it's a wonderful suggestion that I might not know my name. You don't have Zip Itty? Try Yippee Iyo Kiyay. Type it in... Yippee Iyo Kiyay. Kiyay, with a K. Try it with a C. Try it with a Kh. Try it with a Ch. Try it with a W for some odd reason. Try Yippee Iyo Kayay spelling Kayay beginning with a W. Type it in. Try Yip as the first name, E-I-O, three middle initials. Try Yip E-I-O Kayay. Type... Try all caps. Try Yippee-Iyo-Kayay! Try Yippee-Iyo-Kayay! And then somehow magically a room becomes available. You guys are great, man. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much, everybody. Please welcome back Brian Regan. That's incredibly kind, man.
