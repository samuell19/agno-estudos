COSTA, GREEK Bobby, a word. - What? - I hear you wanna work for the Albanians? No, I don't, honest. - Don't lie to me, you prick! Don't you ever show your face here again! - Please, Uncle, no! I swear by your dead mother, I'll break every bone in your body. BOBBY, SERB GABRIEL, TURK May I introduce you? This is my dear brother Gabriel. Fresh out of jail. And this is my beautiful, wonderful and dearest friend and partner, Alice. - Hello. A pleasure to finally meet you. - Go ahead, kiss. We have a present for you. It's a Phurba dagger. A what? - Phurba. - It's a Buddhist good luck charm. It'll protect you from evil demons on the path to enlightenment. We made it ourselves. - I'm going to need it. Thanks. Chapeau! Muhammad Ali! - Bobby Capone! You're back, man! - I'm back! - Let me hug you. I don't believe it. Look at you! You lost weight. You look like Gandhi. What's wrong? They don't serve kebab in jail. - Kebab? Fuck kebab! I'll stuff you with food till it's coming out your ears. There's someone I want you to meet. Alice! Alice, know who this is? How could you? Baby, he's a legend. The toughest guy in Hamburg-Altona. Forget the guys on TV. They're nothing. He's a real killer. Baby, this is Gabriel. My bad-ass motherfucker. - Hello. Gabriel, you know who this is? Luckily, I got lucky. No scene queen, bitch or dumb blonde trash for me. Instead, I get the girl of my dreams. Just look at her. My angel. The mother of my children, if I ever have any. My girl. Look at her. Such a sweetheart. - Yes, alright! Alice, shall we dance? - She's so sweet. So? - What, so? What do you think? - I thought you went for blondes with big tits. Times change. I'm more into inner beauty and stuff like that now. Inner beauty? - Inner beauty. Gabriel! - Alright, alright, come on. Hey, man! What's this? - What's what? - This! A bomber jacket. - What are you wearing? I think I look pretty cool. - You look like shit. Look at yourself. Then look at me. - You look great. Maybe you made a mistake tonight? A mistake? What did I do wrong? You know perfectly well that Cenk's only getting married once. - Let's hope so. Costa, don't fuck with me. Listen. I'm vouching for you tonight. Do you know what that means? You saw them all staring outside. They see you and come to me, not to you. So now what? Now we Kiss. Come here. What did I tell you on the phone? I forgot. Why, Costa? Why don't you listen to me? Why should I? Are you better than me? I've had enough. Enough of him. But I don't know how to tell him. Write him a letter. A letter! That's too childish. I have to tell him straight to his face, "Costa, I'm leaving you." Won't you give him another chance? He's totally in love with you. What's he going to do without you? - Alice! I don't love him anymore, you know? Is there something else? Like what? There's something else. Have you met someone else? Where did you get that idea? - You have! Who is he? Do I know him? Tell me! - Calm down! Yes, I met someone else. You sure dance cool. - Really? The way you move, it... it drives me crazy, you know that? Are you here by yourself? - No, with my husband. With your husband? Tell your husband I envy him. I envy him deeply. That's much better, man. Cool suit. - It is cool. Well it's mine, dickhead! - Hey, Costa, you look great. You look great too. - Yeah? - We all do! And we're back together again. Think you can split for an hour? - What for? We have a small surprise for you. A small surprise? - Really small. - This big. So what have you both been up to? - This and that. - And the other. What do you mean by this and that? I still steal. - And I still sell. Costa... I heard you treat my sister like a piece of shit. You heard I treat your sister like a piece of shit? - That's what I heard. Where did you hear that? - It's what people say. They do, huh? Watch it, boy. Don't lose her, she's a great girl. How about you telling her what a great guy she's got? What's so funny, asshole? - Nothing, dude. You're both just so cute. Hey, where are we heading anyway? Be ready for a surprise. - And before you know it... You're gonna get some... bang-bang action. Bingo! Hey, what's going on? Your dick is free again, Tiger! - Off you go then, man. I've got a laptop. Hip-hop! - Tiptop! Seven. One! Eight. One! - Costa, no motherfucker on earth is gonna give you a grand and you know it. That's why I'll give you eight now. Music to your ears. Okay. Nine! You're a real dickface, you know that? Eight! Fuck you, give me the eight. Hand them over! Gimme the laptop. Gimme the laptop! You're trying to rip me off! There's only seven here! It's only seven! Costa, you know what? You can be such a cheapskate. Really. Our buddy comes back and you won't even pitch in for his present? Ripping me off like a true Yugoslavian! Nothing doing! Life goes on. - Nothing doing? Give me another 100. Can you give me a power pack? - I can, for another 100. You know what? You've become pretty good at this. Leave her be. You don't have money for that. Give it to Miro, or he'll kick your ass. My son, you can't disappear for an hour at your brother's wedding. Your friends show up and you start acting crazy again. I was only gone for 15 minutes. - What? Your watch must be made in Japan. You were gone for exactly one hour. Father, I apologize. - Alright, but don't do it again. Congratulations, son, may God watch over you. Congratulations, daughter, may God watch over you. Congratulations, son, may God watch over you. Mama's boy can't stand to be away from her. - She is my mother. Best wishes to you. Best wishes. - Thanks. You're very beautiful. I'm glad you're out. - Thanks. Great hairdo. You look like a movie star. Here's 100 marks. From Mom? - Yeah. - Figures. Don't drink too much tonight. - Why not? - You'll be driving a taxi tomorrow. Dude, I can't. The cops took my license. - Hey, hey! You'll be using mine. But no shady stuff, or I'll rip your head off. Alright? Okay, man. - Okay. - Thanks. Alright. - Now go and have fun. - I will. Cenk, you old tiger. - Bobby... You lion. - Hello. Now let me see... Thanks. I wouldn't wanna prick your belly. - It's hard to miss. I wish you both all the best. Children, health, money... I don't know, just the best of everything. Cenk, if you ever need anything, whatever it is, you come to me, okay? Alright. Take care of yourself. Wonderful. You're a wonderful couple. Charming, really charming. Right. Congratulations. Yeah. Cenk. - Costa. You got married, man. Crazy! Sorry. You should do so yourself. - I have something for you. Wait. Where do I put it? - A hundred? Give it to her. Okay. Okay, all the best. Cenk, awesome! How are you going to make a living? - I'm going to drive a taxi again. You're going to drive a taxi again? - I am. Driving a taxi is a real cool job, but wouldn't you rather work for me? As what? - I start working for the Albanians next week. You, a Serb? It's what you call "multi-cultural.‚Äù - Multi-cultural? Didn't know that. - So how about it? No. Why not? No more shady stuff. Those days are over. Besides, I promised my probation officer. Probation officer? Fuck all probation officers! Today's a new start. Now! Look, Bobby. Listen carefully. I want to take it easy, save some money and then... off to Turkey. Get it? Sun, beach, the sea, a job... - What job? Don't know yet, but I'll find something. Maybe I'll sell jewellery. We could make it for you. - A very cool idea. What's your last name? - Lorenz. "Yenilmez & Lorenz." Sounds good. - I thought you were a cool guy. Like you? What are you laughing at? Come on, dude, let's dance. Let's get out there. - Good idea. I feel bad now. - Nonsense. He can take it. I'm gonna go dance. Almost like old times. How about a photograph? - Good idea. Guys, look over here. Show her you don't need her. - But I do. - Bobby, you talk shit. I talk shit? - Yes, you do. - Costa, do I talk shit? - Yes, you do. I talk shit. You talk shit! - Bobby, leave it! Telling me I talk shit. What bullshit. I just gave him some advice. I'm scared. You'll manage, my old lion. Just don't beat her. That wouldn't be cool. You wouldn't stand a chance anyway. I don't want to lose her. You won't. Good luck, man. I don't know how to do this. - Do what? Breaking up. Never done it before. - Tell me go to hell, as usual. I don't want you to go to hell. I thought we could stay friends. - Stay friends? You mean friends, as in going for a beer, have a smoke? I'm serious! - So am I! What's wrong with you? What the hell's wrong with you? I don't know. - But I do. You just don't love me anymore. No. I don't want to cry in front of you. I just couldn't stand that, okay? I wish there was a trick to make this easier. - Then stay with me. I swear I'll stop stealing and smoking pot. I'll get a job. Please! - I can't. Alright, then go. Go on, get lost! Go, get lost! I don't give a shit about you. Got it? I don't give a shit about you! At first I just wanted to fuck her. I tried everything, you name it. But I couldn't pull it off. Then, at some point, I thought, "Hey, I've fallen in love with her." Gabriel... When she kisses me awake in the morning with these sugar-sweet lips of hers, I open my eyes and think I'm gonna flip out. Afterwards we sit in bed, drink coffee, smoke a cigarette and we talk. We talk. We just talk non-stop. She's the only woman who accepts me as I am. What chick does that nowadays? Why do you think she fell in love with you? I'm probably not the asshole everyone takes me for. Sure you won't work with me? I'm meeting one of the Albanians tomorrow. I'll ask if they need anyone else. Bobby, forget it. Fuck that shit! Come on. Fuck that shit? Ceyda, did you break up with him? Well, isn't that just great. Why is this happening to me? Why? I don't understand. These things always happen to me! Damn it! That woman drives me crazy. She drives me crazy! I'm freaking out here. Fucking shit! Damn it! Why didn't you smash the other window? I'd have the dress for Alice. Tell me why! You should've told me. Come on. - I couldn't have. - Hey, Costal! Costa... Look at him! Don't rile him, man! - But look... - Don't rile him! The damned slut! - Hey, is it my ears, or are you talking about my sister? Your baby sister, I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget. - Don't. My father says you should get a haircut. - He's right. Cut off that mane, dude. You look like Jesus! I am Jesus, dude! Didn't you know? I love you, you asshole! What would your father say, if he found out his daughter was seeing a Greek? He'd rip his head off. - What? Just for being a Greek? No, for getting in his daughter's pants. - And if I were a Turk? You'd be a disappointment to your parents. - To my parents? I don't get it. You don't get it? Look, if you were a Turk while your parents were Greek... Cut the bullshit, dude! - He doesn't get it! - No. You know why? Because Greeks reek. I would say, "Greeks sneak!" - I say, "One for you and one for you!" Go sit on a piece of Serbian meat and spin round! - Oh yeah? You're an asshole. - Sure I'm an asshole! What do you think? Hey, Nejo! Hey, Nejo, man! - Cool hat! - What kind of hat is that? Long time no see, man. - When did they let you out? Hey, Nejo, you asshole. Oh, shit! I don't believe it. That guy's licking your girl's face. Are you letting him get away with that? Are you letting him get away with that? What kind of jerk are you? So this is your reason! - Costa, get lost. - That's your reason? Leave her alone! - Man, piss off, and take your friends with you! Get your hands off me, you asshole! - Sven, let's go. - Alright, alright. It's alright, okay? - Okay, okay... Sven, stop it! Sven, stop it, man! You think you got what it takes, you asshole? - Bobby, stop it! Stop it! - Stop it, come on. Sven! Sven, come on, man! Leave those guys alone! Gabiriel! Stop it! - Ceyda, get back. Gabriel, stop it! Stop! Gabriel, that was just like old times. Let me kiss you, you asshole! Go fuck yourself, damn it! What's wrong with you? You assholes! I just got out of jail, remember? I just got out and now this! Relax, what's wrong with you? Admit that you fucked up again! - Okay, I fucked up. I'm sorry, so? You're sorry? So am I. For hanging out with assholes like you. It's alright. - It's not alright. Think you'll get my sister back this way? Then you don't know her very well. This is not okay. I just beat up a guy who did me no wrong. Fuck the both of you. I'm going home. I need some sleep. What's wrong with him? He wants to grow up. And we're holding him back. It's almost dawn. Will you come and pray with me, my son? Some other time. Not now. It's up to you. Have a nice morning. I thought you didn't want to fight anymore! When your boyfriend beats up my guys, I will defend them, get it? You're such a mess, Ceyda. Do you have any idea what you did to Costa? Do you? Huh? Why make out in public here in Altona? Do it wherever you like, but not here! Who I make out with and where is none of your business. I've always defended you, stuck by you. Remember I protected you from Mum and Dad. You can stay out as late as you want. Show me another Turkish girl who can! Right. And when you fell in love with Costa, I stood by you too. But I don't respect this crap. It makes me wanna puke! I can't chose who I fall in love with. You say you want what's best for me. This guy doesn't take drugs, he has money, he's his own man. Can Costa offer me that? Ceyda... He needs you! Do you want me to sacrifice myself? Good night. Why did you quit Silvio's? He treated me like a slave. He didn't trust me, you know? Besides, Silvio's got no style. Why didn't he trust you? Because he's my uncle. - Silvio's your uncle? I'm in a car with Silvio's nephew? Muhamer, if it's... - Listen to me! If you have family trouble and want to take revenge, then get out now, before I throw you out! My mother always said, "Never get involved with Serbs." Why should I get involved with you? - Why? Because I'm good, that's why. - "Because I'm good, that's why." So you're good, huh? See that gypsy over there? Okay. Ciao. He owes me a lot of money. Just won't give it back. "Tomorrow," he says. He's been telling me that for a week, "Tomorrow." I should get out and kick his ass. You're good? Show me. You want me to kick his ass? - Do it and you're hired. Hired as what? - Do it or get out of here. Okay, I'll do it. I won't help you. You know Muhamer? You know Muhamer? The guy over there. You know Muhamer. You owe him money. Give me the money. Give me the money or I'll rip off your face, you jerk! And don't come here again, or you're dead. Did you pay those Kurds to do that? - Better. I know them. They're dealers. I told them the guy was selling H on their street. You did what? I went in and said, "The guy over there, he's selling H in your barrio. I know it's none of my business ..." They went crazy. That's what you said? - That's what I said. - You did? - I did. That's not bad. And they totally bought it. I don't believe it. - Yeah. "He sells H!" Really cool. - They all stormed out and I just stood there, thinking, "Not bad."‚Äù You're my man. You're my man. You're in. Yes, you're in. - Yes! Let's get to work! - What? I have a job for you. Thanks, but I'm not sure. Cut the crap. You wanted a job, here's one. Not at the post office! You're kidding. Fight for it. Do something. I can't steal. I must never steal again, Bobby! Who said so? The dead guy on the cross? The dead guy on the cross, he died for your sins, too. I don't have any sins. - A sign from God. I mustn't steal again. Be glad! Yes, but I need a hundred. I was going to steal a bicycle. Take it, I have enough. - Bobby, you'll get it back. Thanks, dude. I want you to take these. Two fifties are a burden. Take the C-note. It's neater. Costa, two fifties have style. One in each hand. That's crap. - You're crap. - I'm crap? Why am I crap? Why do you tell him this crap? - Guys, guys, guys! This one's for you. This one's for you. And this one's for me, okay? Hi, Honey. - You look smart. I have a beautiful man. - That's a lie. No! - I have a really beautiful woman. Do you know who's invited us to dinner in an hour? - No. Who? - The mafia invited us! That's not a joke, it's true. I don't feel like it. You don't feel like it? My boss wants to meet you. He's a cool guy. - No... I'm not in the mood for the mafia. Besides, I don't have anything to wear. You don't have anything to wear. I see, I see, I see. If I had something to wear for you, would you promise to come? I'd have to like it. Hey, what do you say? You're nuts. How is it? Delicious, really! Yes, it's edible. - Edible? I could bathe in this stuff. It's the only decent Italian in the neighborhood. I know these guys well. We were in jail together. They must be Sicilian, right? Mafiosi, huh? - Car thieves. And what do you do? What I do? I'm eating. Bobby says you're an important man round here. - Did he say that? I own a brothel. If you'd told me a pimp was buying us pasta, I wouldn't have come. What have you got against pimps? It's a respected job round here. And it offers a lot of tax advantages. A respected job? You're more primitive than I thought. - That's enough, Alice, okay? Are you on hunger strike now? Okay. Let's try again. I'm Muhamer. I'm leaving. You coming? Hey, Alice, relax. Drink wine, eat pasta, enjoy the evening. Are you coming? Let her go. Your girlfriend thinks she's better than us. If she acts up on you, slap her. Now eat. Sven was so mad, he almost went to the cops. You advised him against it. - Right! Thanks. Forget Sven, I almost went myself. Then you'd be back in jail. For life. Sexy dress! Feel like beating up my boyfriend? That nice guy? He's not nice. He's a jerk. - What's wrong? We went to dinner with some idiot. Bobby told me he's his new boss. Turns out the guy's a pimp. It was too much. I left. - And Bobby? He stayed put. What was his name? Muhamer, or Asshole. Do you know him? I've heard of him. What? Well, that he's an asshole, for example. That asshole ruined my night. Oh, come on, the night's still young. He's right. You should've met sooner. Pity I never visited him. So what about you and Bobby? He's been getting on my nerves. Sometimes I think he lives on another planet. I don't understand him. We're on different wavelengths. I don't get it. - Me neither. This is Svenny-Manny. - Sven! Hi. - Hello, Alice. How do you know she's called Alice? - You told me. - Right. Gabriel. Sven. Sorry about your nose, man. Sorry about your lip. Let's get out of here. - Where are you going? Well, out of here! I'm hungry! I thought you just had dinner. - I didn't eat anything. Okay, then let's go. Okay. I'll be right with you. You really want to move to Turkey? - Yes. Why? I thought of it while I was in jail. You hang around in your cell, and you're all alone. They tell you when to get up, when to go, when to eat. Everything. The only thing they can't take away are your dreams. In Turkey you're never alone. Everybody knows everyone. Relatives everywhere. It's warm. Alive. What will you do for a living? I've always dreamed of running a beach caf√© on the south coast. Hang out on the beach all day, rent out boats... look at the girls... I'd be right by the waves. Know what's great about waves? They never stop. Can I ask you something? Bobby and you, how did you get together? Why do you want to know? - I'm curious. I went to the movies with Ceyda one day. She brought Costa, he brought Bobby. Then what? No idea. He interested me. On the one hand he was funny and charming, on the other hand he was a macho. Do you think I'm a macho? A bit. What do I owe you? - Excuse me? Well, you're a taxi driver, you drove me around. Forget it. Thank you. Good night, Gabriel. - Good night, Alice. Sweet dreams. You too. Gabriel, what kept you? - Cenk, let me kiss you. Stop that kissing. - Looking good! - Give me the money. Yes! Is that all? - That's all. I wait for you for an hour for 30 marks? - For 30 marks. Sorry. I can explain. What did you do the whole time? - Drive through Altona for just two fares. Two fares? - Don't get upset. - I'm not upset! Why are you grinning? Are you stoned? - I'm not stoned. I'm happy, man! Does she have tits? - Hey... She's a sweet little thing from Altona. Must be really sweet, if you make me wait for an hour. - Cenk, I'm sorry. Forget it. What's that on your lip? - I had a small pimple. I used to get those too. Do I know her? Don't think so. Is it serious? No... So, do you like it? Do I like it? I love it! Then buy it. How much? Normally... 500. These things are hard to get. But you guys want to do business. I like you. So because it's you... 400. 300. He'll make his way. - You sure you need it? I'm sure it'll bring good luck. Got any more? Alright, alright, alright! What you do with them is your business. Whether you want to kill your rivals, arm your boys or sell them on, I don't give a shit. I'll make you a really good deal, but you should know one thing. This stuff... is really good. Take a look. If you like them, buy them. If not, forget it. I can sell them anywhere. Yes, I guess we're in business. Okay. Can I ask you something? Ask. Let me handle this deal. I knew that was coming. You're nuts. It takes years before you can handle such a deal. Why? I had the guy wrapped around my little finger. - That's what you think. That's what you think. He wanted to sell it for 500. - Now you listen to me. My father always said, "Big deals are for big men." Do you think you're a big man? - Hey, but I could become one. I could learn a lot from you and I'm good. - Am I a school? Do I look like a school? No, but you're like a master. At least let me try. Let me have a shot. You're a bit like me when I was young. A little rugrat. I'm a bit like him! Right guys, we can't watch a video at my place. I sold my VCR last week. Can't go to mine either. My father would invite us to pray. Let's watch it at Alice's place. I haven't seen her since that crappy dinner anyway. I saw her last night. - You saw her last night? Yep. - So what did she say? The Albanian got on her nerves, that's what she said. What do you think of her? Of whom? - My girl. She's nice. She's a bitch. I don't get you, man. You've got a wonderful woman. She has brains, owns a store. She's nice and sweet. So why do you talk about her like that? Because she made a fool of me in front of my boss, that's why! She didn't make a fool of you. You made a fool of yourself. By meeting up with that jerk. Just quit, guys. - We haven't even started. The thing is, dude, I'm quitting. You can't stop. You've been selling dope since I've known you. Your second name is Dope. You are dope. You can't stop smoking dope. But ever since I've known me, I've had problems. They used to be small, now they're big. Some of them are so far out, they end up in my fridge. You've got nothing to eat. The other day, for instance, I wanted to go to my car. I go downstairs, into the street, head for my little car, but I can't find the stupid thing! I've got a tiny, black Ford Fiesta, with "Cats" stickers on the side. I start looking for the thing. It sticks out, you can't miss it. But I can't find it. Well, at some point I did find it, three blocks down the road. I spot the car, so I want to go over there and get in... I didn't bring the keys! Nejo, that's no reason to quit! - Happens to us all the time. A key here, a key there... So I think, "Right, no key, now what? Do I really walk all the way back home? Or do I hot-wire the thing? It's my car, after all." So I think, "Nejo, hot-wire the thing." So bam ...! I open the door, get in... hot-wire it and drive off. On the road I notice... "Hey, I never moved my hands!" Normally you move your hand while driving. You know... gears! It's an automatic! Don't worry about it. I drive one too. It's great in the city. The thing is, my tiny, black Ford Fiesta with the sweet "Cats" sticker on the side is not an automatic, it has a gearbox, dude! He stole the thing! - Wild! So I think, "Before I'm fucked, better pull over to the curb, park the thing and get out." You know? "Get out and walk home." You know? So I get out and want to take the subway, but I think, "Shit, no cigarettes!" Back to the car. This... This is where things get illegal. I know it's not my car, but get in anyway. Door's open. I look for cigarettes. Nothing. I open the glove compartment... Now my problem is in the fridge. - So what's in there? A corpse, or what? A gun, dude! No idea whose it is, but I don't want it around. I'm selling it. Costa? Is it loaded? It's loaded as fuck! Nejo, keep it. We came for dope, man. Bobby? You see that? You see that? Listen to this! Listen to this, dude! Now I can... Blam! Blam! Blam! What do you want with that gun, man? - Nothing. I carry it for protection. I don't carry one and I still feel safe. But being a taxi driver you could use one. - I don't need shit! Are you gonna shoot a cop who frisks you? - I don't like that. I carry it around like a talisman, like a chain, it brings good luck! Don't fuck with me. I see a naked woman next to me, so I fuck her. I've got a kebab in my hand, so I eat it. And if I've got a stupid gun, I'm gonna use it, get it? Let's get a movie, okay? That's just crap! - It's impossible. - They fly up thousands of meters. Totally impossible. What a load of crap. Cool movie. It wasn't all that cool. - I thought it was crap. Totally, dude. We should've gotten "Scarface." We always get "Scarface." - Because it has the King in it: Pacino! You know, Pacino! And not Ming Fang Yong Chong, or what's his name, man. You dig Pacino, right? - Pacino's a cool guy. He's hung like a dinosaur. The guy's got giant cojones. They weigh at least 50 kilograms. Know what I mean? Look, it's like this... You dream of the sea, am I right? You dream of selling Coca-Cola, what do I know, renting out boats... and of sunshine and stuff like that. You see? And I dream of money. I dream of black bitches with big tits walking the streets bringing home the cash, you know? I dream of fame. You dream of fame? - I dream of fame. Then become an actor, man! - One point for him. Actor? When's Alice coming back? You'd like to know, wouldn't you? Let's play a game. Feel like playing a game? - So tell us, what kind of game? Whoever the ashes fall on gets smacked in the face. But it has the be a proper smack. - Of course. - A proper smack? Hard. - Real hard. And he buys a round. - And he buys a round too. I think that's a good idea. - So let's play. And you're sure you'll go along? - Yes, of course! We started, watch out. I didn't mean it like that. - It still counts. I can't breathe! Hey, Saloniki, shut up already. Want some coffee? No thanks. Go back to sleep. Morning. - Morning. Hello, Bobby. Bad night's sleep? What's this? Don't I get a kiss anymore? I want a kiss too. Costa... Hey Babe... Babe! Sit down. That stunt you pulled in the restaurant the other day... It was enough to made me sick. - You didn't have to drag me along. I know. But the guy wanted to meet the woman I love. What's so bad about that? He made me sick. Do you know what your problem is, Princess? The guy was being too honest. - You're crazy. How did it go with Gabriel? Did you have a good time? A little dance, a little drink... Tell me. You never told me about it. You're starting to get on my nerves. - You get on my nerves all the time! So get lost! You want me to get lost? You want me to get lost? What about Gabriel? Huh? He looks at you. You look at him A glance here, a come-on there. What's all this crap about Yenilmez & Lorenz? Are you shitting me? Sounds good. I said, are you shitting me? - Are you nuts? - Shut up, Costa, shut up! Get out... Get out. Get out! Go on, get lost! I don't want to see you again! Get lost! Get out! - Come on, man... Hey dude. How are you? - I'm fine. How are you? I don't know. Do you need money? - I just wanted to see you. Cool idea, man. Here I am. Can we talk? We can always talk. Just don't sneak into my taxi, playing hide and seek. What's wrong? Bobby's meeting the Albanian tonight. He wants me to join him. - Are you going? Yeah, I promised. Why, damn it? Why's he dragging you into it? Bobby's been so on edge lately, it's unbelievable. Just now he hit Alice. Bam! Right in the face. I've never seen anything like it. Hitting a girl? You can't do that. Bobby said he needed a driver. I drive cars. That's my job. Is that all you can do? Where do your talents lie? I used to swipe bicycles. I think I managed that pretty well. You're a comedian? Say you're driving a car... The trunk is loaded with guns. The cops stop you and say, "Young man, open the trunk." What do you say? I tell them, "Oops, I must have stolen the wrong car!" That's good. That's good. He must've stolen the wrong car! I like it. You will need a car. What? You will need a car. Does that mean I'm doing the deal? That's what it means. Muhamer... I swear by my mother, I won't let you down. If you blow this deal, you're a goner. A real goner. No playing around with the weapons. No playing around with the money. Jerk me around and I will waste you. Not even Silvio will be able to help you then. Got that? - Got it. I want to see you back here at one. Do you understand? - Yep. When do I want see you back here? - At one. - That's all. Get out. Oh, shit. Bobby, let's go. You always have to open your big mouth! - Let's go. - Get out of my joint. Shut your trap! Keep out of this! Why are you fucking with me? This is my place, remember that! My... place! Bobby! Waste that pig! Costal Don't fuck it up for me. Muhamer... stop it. Please. Will you tell me to shut my trap again? Please... - Tell your friend... never to show his face here again. Tell him! Or I will kill him. Fuckface! Gabriel... I'm sorry. - Fine friends you are. Congratulations. Get up. Get up. Gabriel... Gabiriel! Shit, shit... Gabriel, what happened to you? - Isn't Ceyda in? Shit, come on in. Does it hurt? Not as much as what happened just now. I mean, we were friends, right, Alice? I cover your ass, you cover mine. We even made some stupid pact. And now this. I have to go now. Yes. Why didn't you steal some other car? The guy drives a BMW. We look like bums in this thing. Listen, it's a personal thing. - What personal thing? You know whose car this is? - Whose? Sven. Will you look at that! It suits that spaz. But it's still a crappy car. Just look at us! Oh, God! - Oh, God, what? What? I'm not supposed to steal anymore. - Costa, you can't be serious! Costa, are you shitting me? What's wrong with you? What? I'm sorry. I'm calling it off. - Costa, listen to me. Listen to me, Costa! This sin is on me, okay? The sin's on you? - This sin is on me. - That's allowed? It's allowed. Not very cool what we did back there. - The guy spent two years in jail. He knows the rules. You don't burst in on the mafia like some big shot. We screwed him, man, without a thought. The guy still treats me like a baby. But I have eyes. I see things. What things? I think there's something going on between him and her. Don't talk shit. Hey-hey, Bobby! Sorry we're late, dude. Ali Baba! Ali Baba and the forty guns. Bobby. Looking good! Everything alright? - Thanks. Everything's fine. Wonderful, wonderful. Hey, Nina says hi. She couldn't sit or work for two days. You gave her a proper fucking! - I'm sorry. You do what you can. - What happened to your wonderful BMW? Don't remind me. Some numbnut crashed into it. - He's a jerk. What's the hippie doing in your car? That hippie is my brother Costa. He's okay. Hey-hey, Brother Costa! Got the dough? Got the stuff? - That's why I'm here. - As am I. Go ahead, count it. - We'll do that later on. Well, recognize this? How could I forget the Black Goddess? Do you like it? Of course I like it. - Wanna touch it? May 1? Hold it. Careful, it could go off. - Okay. Looks great on you. Okay, take it back. Hey, how about I give you the dough and you give me the guns? No, you got that wrong. You give me the dough and I keep the guns. Get out of the car! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out of the car! You know, there are two kinds of people. Those who cheat and those who get cheated. Which kind are you, Bobby? - Face down on the floor! On the floor! Shit, what am I gonna do now? Shit, shit, shit ...! What do I do now? You jerks! Assholes! Why not just kill me, you jerks! - Calm down, man. Calm down. Shit! Bobby, stop that shit. Bobby! Man, cut it out! Get a grip! Come on, it'll be okay. The guy will kill us. Costa, he can't be reasoned with. - I know what to do. We need loads of money quickly, okay? Okay? I have an idea. I'll ask Alice to sell her store. That's a good idea. It's a good idea. A good idea... - It's a good idea. - Okay? - It's okay. It's okay. Come here. Winter's coming, right? We'll meet here tomorrow at ten, okay? - Here at ten? Alright. Give me a kiss. Three kisses... Take care of yourself, okay? - You too. Alice? Alice, please! Please open the door! - What do you want? Let me in. I have to talk to you. - I've had enough. Get lost! Just listen to me! - No! I'm sorry I slapped you. Get lost. Alice, I'm in deep fucking shit! Hello, Bobby. Get down from there! Do you know how long I waited for you? You know how long, you jerk? Are you trying to fuck me over? You jerk! Where's that Greek? Where's my money? Goddamn you! - I'll pay you back! How are you gonna pay me back? I'll give it back. - What? I want it now! - What? Let me go. I'll kill you. I swear by my mother. Let me go. You point a gun at me? At me? You wanna waste me? You wanna waste me? We fucked up. We always fuck up. Come on. I'm starting to get worried. - Give his mum a call. Hey... Hey, Costa? Hey, what's wrong? Bobby's dead. He's dead. What? Hey, I need to make a call. It's urgent, man! - Go somewhere else. Dude, get a move on. I gotta make a call. - Find another phone! Costa, come on. Let's go, come on. I slept with Alice. You did what? Did Bobby know? And what happens now? I don't know. I need a flight to Istanbul. - When? The first one available. Tomorrow morning? The return flight is not before the 30th. I don't need a return flight. There and back is cheaper. - But I don't want to come back. I said I don't need a return flight. - Maybe you'll reconsider. That's how you get rid of problems, right? Then name me a good price. Hi, Honey. What do you want? Bobby is dead. That's one of your lousy tricks, right? - It's not a lousy trick! Wait, I'll get my jacket, alright? Piss off, you! - Sven, stop it! I'll blow you both away! I'll blow you away, then you and then myself! Costa, put the gun down. Costa... Give it to me. We'll talk, just you and me. Stay here, man! I wanted to see you... before I leave in the morning. Come on in. What's going to become of us? What we did was wrong. Yes. Can't you stay a few days longer? Please. What's that? You want to shoot him and just split? That's cowardly. Give me the gun. I have to do it. I owe it to him. - You owe him nothing! Bobby was responsible for himself. - I cut him loose, Alice. I fucked his woman and he croaked. - That's not your fault. We cheated on him. Have you forgotten? We cheated on him. We simply betrayed him. We sent him to hell, Alice. We sent him to hell! - That's bullshit! It's not bullshit. I don't wanna feel guilty for the rest of my life. I don't want that! You think by shooting him you can clear your conscience? You're crazy! I mean, we didn't just fuck. I've fallen in love with you. - Stop it! Shit! Give me the gun, Gabriel. Give me the gun. Gabriel... What happened to you? - Nothing. Costa's snapped. He threatened Sven and me with a gun and ran off. What are you doing? What's he going to do? - I don't know. What's going on here? Step aside. Let him go, Alice. Come here! Where's my money? Your money? I blew it all! I fucked your money. And now I'm gonna fuck you! Oh yeah? I'm gonna waste you. - You're gonna waste me? That was for Bobby. Stand up straight! Be a man! Stand up straight. What? You're gonna waste me? You filthy swine! You coked-up bastard! Say my name. Say my name! Say it, say it! Say it! - Asshole. Costal Costa, it's me, Gabriel. Gabriel... I've fucked up again. - You haven't, man. You haven't. Will I die now? Of course you'll die, you asshole. I know you. You shot him? I'll call you an ambulance. I don't wanna die. - You won't die. It hurts so much. Do you want her back? What did you think? What would you give to get her back? My damned life. Then stay alive. Do you have to you go? Will you come back? I don't know. Son, will you pray with me? Like any movie, every life comes to an end.
