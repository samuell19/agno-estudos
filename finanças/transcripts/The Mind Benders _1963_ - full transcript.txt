Paddington, Oxford Street. Taxi, Dr. Hall? Taxi. The train now standing at platform one is for Oxford. Oh, Professor Sharpey. Tate. I am sorry. I managed to get us a couple of seats Good, good. - Are you all right? - Oh, yes, perfectly, I... Are you sure? Yes, yes, London's very tiring. Excuse me. There's an apocryphal story that the famous Dr. Einstein was travelling on exactly this train route before the publication of his relativity theory. He's asking, does Oxford stop at this train? I find this an amusing anecdote. Absolutely, sir. I think what is particularly amusing about this anecdote which might possibly be better described as a philosopher's chestnut is that the incident is supposed to have taken place in... Sharpey! What's this mess about? Oh, dear, now the train will be late. He's dead. Did you know him? It's Professor Sharpey. It was the most extraordinary tragedy. He simply got to his feet and jumped out of the compartment. Perhaps we should give your names to the guard. Are you a police officer, sir? Not exactly. It's his briefcase. It's money. A great deal of money. You'd better give it to the guard. Major Hall. That's very clever of you. I don't forget faces. The director's in his room. It is Major, isn't it, or is it Doctor? It's both. You're presenting me with Hobson's Choice. Part of our work is classified, that's why I can't stop you from coming in, but I can give you my opinion as director of the lab. It can't help the work or the atmosphere of the place having a security man asking questions. Somebody paid 1,000 pounds in notes to Professor Sharpey. And I know the people he saw in London, yesterday. I'm telling you I have evidence of treason. Well, that doesn't surprise me. I'm afraid you're missing my point. - Doesn't surprise you? - Well, of course it doesn't. - You didn't like Sharpey? - I liked him very much. I worked with him off and on for over 20 years. And anybody who denies he was one of the greatest physiologists of our time must be a fool, but with all his good intentions, his ban the bomb-ism, his pacifism, all his left-isms, he was as naive politically as a child of seven. And the Americans knew how dangerous that was. That's why they flung him out of space physiology over there. They never proved anything against him. As soon as he was back here he was meeting all these strange gentlemen with central European names and snow on their boots. Cultural attaches, you know. There was nothing in it, then? He had complete integrity until very recently. Until the last few weeks. Suddenly he's no longer the humane old professor protesting for peace. He's taking money. He's talking to the professionals, from draughty telephone boxes or on park seats, the whole chilly paraphernalia of treason. Isn't it reasonable that I should ask a few questions about his work here this summer, about his closest colleagues? You're still missing my point. Just as I knew the old man was dangerous I know that you're wasting your time asking questions here. Dr. Longman was with him in America, I believe. Yes. Was he still working with Sharpey here? If you can call it work. Longman hasn't been in the lab for six weeks. Until then, were they still experimenting on space physiology? Yes, in addition to their teaching work, of course. An aspect of it they call isolation. I suppose it had some value. Isolation could make a good starting point for me. I should like to know more about it. Longman's not here, you say? I wouldn't think so. Is there anybody else who could help me? Well, there's young Tate I suppose. He helped with the earlier low temperature work. I could introduce you to him. You're very persistent. That's the military mind. Couldn't you have done something? Couldn't you have seen it coming? There really isn't much point in asking questions, Stuart, if the answer's obvious. Yes, but was he all right at Paddington? He said he was tired. Do you really think it could've been an accident? I mean it was after a station, wasn't it? Gentlemen, I can't approve of this sort of talk. It really doesn't help the lab to have this sort of gossip going on. Sorry sir. Who's he? - Shh. My dear fellow, you mustn't encourage that sort of talk. They're naturally curious. Isn't that what we train them to be? Of course I understand. We're all working under a sense of strain. You're standing in for Longman here. - He's ill? - Oh, yes, mm. I know Longman has his own methods, even to refusing to answer his telephone. Well, never mind, you must just stand in for him again. I want you to meet Major Hall. Military intelligence. We have already met. Hello. - He's also a scientist. - I was. And he's interested in isolation. If you'd help me, I'm afraid it's all quite new to me. Well, I certainly can't lecture on it and I don't know much more that you do. I know nothing. That's what I mean. Well, you could start with the film. That'll put him in the picture. - Sharpey's film? - Mm. I've got it here. We'd better pull down the blinds. Well, I've work to do. When you've finished perhaps you could find your way back to my room. Thank you. I gather Dr. Longman worked with Sharpey in the States. That blind's not quite shut. We're ready now if you'd care to sit down. All right, Norman. The Arctic Circle in April 1960. This is the hut, where an extremely brave French geophysicist Dr. Jean Bonvoulois spent the winter of 1959, 1960. A small party of us, relieved Dr. Bonvoulois that spring. He spent the last four months of it alone in almost perpetual darkness. At that time, our party was interested in the effects of low temperature. We simply wanted to know what happens to people when the thermometer drops far below zero. The applications of such knowledge could be useful in anything from modern surgery to space travel. Dr. Tate and I interviewed Bonvoulois a few hours after we had found him in his hut. And this film was taken at that time. Notice his behaviour. No need to be afraid. Drink. Now, where do you think you are? It may be too soon. No, it's all right. It's important we get something down straight away. Tell us your name. Do you know what you're called? Yes. - What? - Your name, your full name. My name is Dr. Jean Bonvoulois. What am I drinking? What is this? How long do you think you were in the hut? You must know things for science. We want to know how long you think you were alone in the hut. Alone. No, I'm not alone. For a few days, maybe. In the beginning. No, no, no. He came. But who came? He came. When things were bad, he came. Who was it, who was he? Who was this man who visited you? Not a man, an angel. His face. His look. He does not know. He does... He's asleep. We went to the Arctic Circle to investigate the hazard of life at 80 below zero. We don't look back for the next few months with pride. It's very easy to get too close to a subject. We set up some experiments. Our object was to simulate the conditions under which Bonvoulois had lived in the Arctic. We set up an almost totally dark cubicle, which was, in fact, little more than a huge refrigerator. We used ordinary students who volunteered to undergo the tests. For different periods and at different temperatures we observed the effects on our subjects measuring all the things you might expect, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate. And each showed symptoms of disorientation and confusion of mind similar to Bonvoulois. It was at this point that Dr. Harry Longman whose own research at this time was devoted to respiration walked through our lab. He asked a very simple question. What makes you think it's got anything to do with the temperature? It hadn't anything to do with low temperature. Bonvoulois and our student guinea pigs had been affected not by the cold, but by their prolonged isolation. One week later, we changed the name of the laboratory to isolation. Now, by isolation we mean the study of what happens to a man when you take away all sensation. We must know what happens to him if he sees nothing, feels nothing, tastes nothing, hears nothing and smells nothing. We want to know what happens to the body and particularly to the central nervous system when a man is put into this complete isolation. Into the sort of conditions that may well be experienced in space flight. To do this we invented a perfectly simple piece of apparatus. When a man is submerged in this tank of ordinary water at blood heat, all sensations over a period of time can be reduced to a minimum. He is utterly isolated, lonely, bewildered. Studying his behaviour under these conditions, we found we had stepped into a new and frightening world. We seem to be dealing, literally, with the physics of the soul. Is there more film? No, Sharpey hoped to do one this summer, but the experiments are still incomplete. Did you continue to work on isolation after the first stages? For a while, the old man, Longman, and me. No students? Just the three of us. At first it seemed rather fun. And at the end? Not such fun? At the end, only Longman and Sharpey were on it. Then only Sharpey. It's some weeks since Longman's been in. How many? Oh, don't look at me. The lab boy doesn't check the professors in and out. About? About six weeks. I think it would be helpful, if I had a word with him. Would you ask him to telephone me? Calder knows where I am. I'd be grateful. I'm just used as a skivvy around here. While you're going Doctor you might give Mrs. Longman this tape. What is it? Sir Malcolm Sargent in Helsinki pinched without permission from the BBC and she's been shouting for it for months. Oh, cheer up, Doctor. Come on, I've got work to do. If you think that I think that you don't want to see Oonagh Longman Doctor then you're wrong. Hello. Is your father in? What is it? Who is it? Just another bloody barracuda. Hello? Is anyone at home? Longman? Oonagh? Who is it? It's Tate. Tate. You'd better come up. That's not a very warm welcome after all this time. Sorry. It wasn't meant to be that way. Come on. I'd offer you a cigarette, but we smoked them all last night. - You? - Yes. Why didn't I used to smoke? No. No? Things have changed. I think Calder's been trying to phone Longman. He took the receiver off the hook last week. We're deeply uncommitted to the world just now. Oh, it's cricket. We bought a beautiful old car. A Lagonda. Doesn't that sound like a goddess? Longman's a marvellous driver. He'll sometimes take the children and shout at people in the streets. Not in the evening, though. Then we're alone. Last night the headlights got quite covered with midges and things. Oonagh. Oonagh, what is all this about? I'm in love, Tate. Doesn't that mean anything to you? No, nothing. Like pain, it's incommunicable. I'm in love. I know you always have been, but why, suddenly this? Tate, how old are you? I'm older than you are. You're not old at all You're like poor dear old Sharpey suspended forever, between man and boy. Pure scientist. Oonagh. Sharpey... Don't cry, I'm going to make some coffee. Longman's in there. Go and see him. - Longman? You used to call him something ruder than that when I was the lodger. I've lost my sense of humour. That's part of it. - Arthur? - No, it's me. Oh. Hello, Tatty. What brings you here? Oh, I brought this tape for your wife. Just dump it on the table, will you? You haven't read the paper? No, no, no. It's amazing how out of touch you can get if you really try. Longman, I've brought some... We've got a new car. At least new in 1931. We've got a new man interested in isolation. Major Hall, from London. He's also interested in Sharpey. What about Sharpey? Well... Well, come on, answer. The answer's in there. I'll go and help Oonagh make the coffee. He really has told you something. Sharpey's dead. He killed himself? Take the tray up, will you, Tatty? He brought the tapes from Norman. Do you want to go up and get... Tate, why didn't you tell me? That's all right, I'll take you up. We should talk. We're putting it off. - Shh. What we're not daring to say is that Sharpey's death had something to do with the experiment. He went on didn't he? It was you, wasn't it? - No. - It was him, wasn't it? - I don't know. I really don't know. - It was you. That voice distorted and horrible, from the tank. No, darling, it wasn't me. Why the hell didn't Norman clear that tape properly? - It was you. - It was not me, darling. Yes it was! Listen to me, listen, listen, be calm, darling. Listen, it wasn't my voice you heard. It was Sharpey's. I knew it would end. I knew it. Never. Don't say that. Don't say never. Why not? I don't know why. Oh, for god's sake, let's go out. Had Sharpey gone as far as this when you were working with him? No, no, no, no. No, that must have been, that must have been five hours in. Now do you wonder why I wouldn't go on? Why I tried to escape? I see. To Oonagh? Mm. Love's very important when you're afraid. It's not just physical. It's more than that. Love is survival. Has it been quite fair to her? Fair? Oonagh and I've been in love with each other from the very first day we ever met every minute, for 12 years. It's just sharper now, that's all, like it was in the beginning. What is this Major, what was his name? Hall. Yes, Major Hall. What did he have to say about Sharpey? Oh, his line couldn't be clearer. He was always meeting the wrong people. Oh yeah, but he wasn't always given a briefcase full of fivers. The major seems to think that that adds up. Two plus two makes treason. Sharpey? Oh no. No. You're not believing, are you? Tate, have you forgotten the man already? You know, I find it hard to explain. Well, that may be so, but there must be an explanation. He was even more of a patriot he was a pacifist. Of course he wasn't a traitor. If you've any theories, you'd better tell them to the major. I must take this back and get it properly wiped. Isn't the weeping willow supposed to be unlucky? I don't know, is it? I remember Sharpey had one in his garden. You're going back aren't you? Yes, I must. I can't believe that. Sharpey wasn't that kind of a man. And yet, he killed himself. Why? Was it something to do with the experiment, that awful voice on the tapes? That's what I've got to find out. Are you going back to the lab? That horrible tank? The scream. Who is it? I thought I might ask you the same question. Ah, Tate Calder gave me the lab key. I'm continuing my education. Well, I saw the shutters were open. My brain ticks over slowly. Am I right in thinking this is merely an extension of the film you showed me? This tank is the same as Dr. Bonvoulois' hut in the Arctic or the cubicles the students were shut in? It was more than an extension. It's a refinement. Do you think you could explain? Well, I may not be up to date, but I'll show you what I know. This is filled with water kept at blood heat and then the subject is submerged. In this rubber suit? Yes. In my day, we went in naked. So that he can breathe and speak he wears this mask. This visor shuts out the light completely. The walls are padded. There are no echoes. And when the windows and the shutters and the doors are closed the place is completely sound proof. Everything he says is recorded. Where are the tapes? There's a microphone in here. And the tape's up there in Lab B where his colleagues sit and bite their nails until it's time to come and haul him out. What are these? Well, they don't want the body to lie at the bottom of the tank or the side, or the top, because they'd feel too much. These ropes ensure he's more or less central in the tank. He hears nothing? Sees nothing, smells nothing because there's nothing to smell. He feels a bit, but a kind of minimum, and tastes nothing. It's hard to believe that's all there is to it. You wouldn't think it'd be so difficult to take a warm bath in a dark room. Well, two men have tried it. One's dead and the other one ran away. Why? You know why. Love can be violent too. That had more to do with fear. Come on now, Paulie, you haven't finished your milk. - I had a pint. - Don't be cheeky, come on. Take it now. It's good for me too remember? Don't make me late. Are logarithms essential for girls, Daddy? Yes, they're absolutely essential for girls. Piers. Coming. You silly little man. Persephone. - Ready, Mommy. There's someone at the door. You haven't got your hat on. I'll take it. Yes? My name is Hall. Major Hall. The man from the ministry. If you could spare five minutes? As you know, I've already spared five weeks. You'd better come in. Would you go in there. - Thank you. After they're ready I shan't be long. Come on, Piers, you come in here. If you don't mind I'd like a witness. A fellow civilian. I believe you were a close friend of Professor Sharpey's. You know it. The gentleman knows it, Piers. You worked with him on isolation. For a limited period. What limited it? A strong sense of panic, on Daddy's part. Yet Sharpey went on alone. What were you afraid of? Tell me, does it never occur to majors that they may be meddling in affairs about which they know absolutely nothing? Majors' duties are clearly outlined. If bewildered they report back to their colonels. The reasons which bring me here are quite simple. Professor Sharpey was dealing with what are defined for majors as undesirable people. Oh, fine, fine, fine. So now he qualifies for the rogues' gallery, subsection, treason. I have proof. Oh yeah? You're a tonic, Major. Isn't he a tonic, Piers? Yes. It's so clear cut. Do this, you're a patriot. Do that, you're a traitor. Obviously. Sharpey sold something worth 1,000 pounds in notes. Yeah. Major. Major, I have worked on isolation. We have a tank... - Daddy. - A perfectly ordinary tank. - Daddy. - What is it, darling? - We want Piers. All right, darling, fine, well you take him. But you drop into that tank one man... - Dad, Daddy. - What, what? Pass him out, out here. Come on, Piers. Penny wants you outside. You drop a man into that tank and leave him there in isolation for a while and some pretty frightening things can happen to him. I know that much. I tried it myself for a while. If you leave him there for a while, and if my guess is right, you could dissolve him. The stiff in the tank. Dissolve him mentally, I mean. Reduce him, until he becomes a sort of, a soulless, mindless, will-less thing. Not even a man at all. A kind of sea anemone. I have in fact seen your tank, but you confess yourself you're only guessing. Oh, Major, please. Faraday was only guessing at the start. All I'm suggesting to you, as politely as possible is that you might take a closer look at what happens to the man in the tank. What may have happened to Sharpey before you close the book on him and file him away under T for traitor. That is precisely why I came to see you, but all you've told me so far is guesswork. Look, I, I'm... All I want to do is to prove to you that a man changes in the tank. He comes out the other end who knows what kind of a man. Different, certainly, perhaps no longer responsible for his actions. If I can prove that, if I can prove that you can go back and click your heels and say Colonel Bogey we got it wrong, spies ain't what they used to be. Spies, Dr. Longman, now, or at any other time are extremely dangerous people. I think you should remember that. We should also remember that I hold a great deal of evidence against Professor Sharpey. I'll bet you do. I'll bet you do. All neatly filed away too. But if my guess is right, Major. If it's right then the file on Sharpey should've been closed a month ago when that brave, silly, dear old dedicated idiot went and submerged himself alone in that tank for far, far too long. And a new file should have been started perhaps labelled Zed for zombie. And Zed for zombie, not S for Sharpey should be filed alongside Guy Fawkes and all the other traitors. You're very eloquent, but you can't prove this, can you? I might. How? By putting someone in the tank. This time, I'm not running away. I don't quite understand why we have such a very complicated recorder. All these different tapes. Oh, well, because we record just about everything we can. What he says, blood pressure, temperature, pulse or heartbeat. To check if the gentleman is still alive. - Everything teed up? - I think so, Doctor. What do you mean, you think so? You should know. Well, yes. As you see we have a military gentleman here today so we shall conduct this patrol into unknown enemy territory in a proper military fashion. Sir One and A, Information. Is the equipment checked? - Checked and ready, sir. - Excellent. Two and B. It's nasty, isn't it? Strictly Frankenstein country and this happens to be fact. Two and B, Intention. To find out what happened to the man who went into the tank while his colleague went on picnics. Method. Take one Longman and dissolve him. If he behaves in a new and dotty way then hand him over to the major here. Then he's to be taken to a place already designated and known by second Lieutenant Tate. Longman is at all times, to be handled with, handled with great care. Always accompanied. Never alone. Never alone till he's readjusted and himself again. And then he has to be returned to his wife and his family. Where's he gone? To be sick, I expect. It isn't pleasant in the tank, Major. Norman. Here. Thanks, Norman. Go and close the shutters. We don't want to disturb the neighbours. ♪ Oh my darling, oh my darling ♪ ♪ Oh my darling Clementine ♪ ♪ Te da dum dum ♪ ♪ Thou art lost and gone forever ♪ Well, here am I, Henry Laidlaw Longman, graduate and doctor of the University of Oxford, the bride in the bath. Oh god, it takes such hours. I feel, I feel, apprehensive. I feel apprehensive now like stretching one's limbs, like waiting, waiting to run a long cross country race. A report was made of the whole experiment. The Report for Colonel Bogey, Longman called it at the time. It carries, with several others, read later at the scientific conference held in America, on the effects of the reduction of sensation. Longman seemed to go through four distinct stages. Irritation. After the first hour of relative quiet, even boredom. He became childishly irritable. Abusive and even comic. ♪ Knees up, knees up, knees up, Mother Brown ♪ Bloody stupid damned waste of time! How many are caught in a day you stupid fat old bitch? Within another hour we had reached a long, curiously lazy, melancholy stage. Starved of sensation from the outside world the surface of the skin itself, grew a sensitivity quite beyond normal experience. He played with the water, feeling his right hand to be the size of a dam with a stream bursting through it. This extra-sensitivity seemed to promote a sequence of erotic hallucinations. He called softly for his wife. Oonagh, hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter. Then all sensation vanished and after two or three hours he seemed to lose confidence in himself as a man. Please, please, it's not fair. It isn't. Please let me out. It's not fair. Please, please let me out. Panic was the third stage. The voice of the trapped monkey. The wasp, beating against the glass. The man on the rack. After five hours without sensation weightless and disorientated he was in a state of complete nervous collapse. At last, the comfort and blessing of hallucination. After seven hours in the tank, he vanished into a world of his own. My dear friend. I'm a very great admirer of your work. That's why I've come to see you. It's lonely, lonely with only your luminous friend here. It was this stage that gave me my clue. Listen, I recognise this. The watery, watery. Rain. - How long has he been in? - Nearly eight hours. It's fantastic. It would take months of solitary confinement to reduce a man to this state. Even if he were kept awake half the time with lights and all the rest of it. You've come into my country don't you see? You've been missing something here. This is an experiment on the fringes of brain-washing. Indoctrination. No wonder they were after Sharpey. We could persuade Longman into anything now. I'm damned sure of it. What do you... Not just persuade him to scratch his right ear. I mean change his most fundamental beliefs. Do you think that's what happened to Sharpey? It could be, but to prove it we'd need to take his firmest belief and break it. And what do we know about him? Is he Catholic? No, no religion. Well, what do we know about him? He's a scientist. Not what he is, what he believes in, Norman. He's married. A belief, Norman. A belief. He certainly loves his wife. That's a kind of belief, isn't it? - No, that's... - That's perfect and we both know it. No, I can't be a party to that. He had the courage to go back in that tank to clear Sharpey. We've got to put him through the strongest possible test. This could prove him right or wrong in one. If we can bend his mind about his wife. What's her name? Oonagh. If we break his belief in Oonagh. Then we know what happened to Sharpey. But what if we succeed, how do we bring him back again? The way to un-wash a brain is to return slowly and patiently over the same ground. I've had experience of this. Everything we say to him will be recorded. We play the tape back to him and when he realises how he was persuaded he'll be readjusted and himself again. Back where he started. No harm done. No, I don't like it. I like nothing in this business. We've still got to do it. We must. You're rushing me into this. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. And all those lies about Oonagh. I can't do it. - Yes, you can. You're the only one who can. Don't worry, I'll give you your cues. Supposing it doesn't work? If it doesn't, we'll have done no damage. If it does, Longman will have been proved right. Do you want him to have gone through all that for nothing? All right. Coffee, Norman. Thanks. Leave us, and lock the door. Come on. Drink a bit. Come on. Starting to recognise me? You are? Want more? You know me, don't you? Yes, I know you. I should jolly well think so. I'd feel insulted if you'd forgotten my name. - No, of course not. - No, I knew you hadn't. What is his name? You said you hadn't forgotten it. Then, what is it? - Of course he knows it. He doesn't. I do. What is it? I'll give you five seconds. One, two. I do know. Tell me then. The man's tired. For god's sake, he knows my name's Tate as well as I know his is Longman. What's it feel like? Asleep for 100 years? No. What then? Awake for a 100 years. It's quite clear from his answer that there's nothing to be gained by cross examination at this stage. There's only one course. No, I don't think you're right. Not necessarily for as long again. No, no, he was a limit. I'm not going back in there again. Oh, no, no, of course you're not. Well, then tell him to get away. Tell him to get out, the bloody man. You seem to forget your responsibilities, Dr. Longman. We are conducting a controlled experiment. As adviser to that experiment I think it would be wisest to put you back in the tank for a further period. Don't let him do it, don't let him do it, don't let him do it! I promise, I promise, I promise. We can't risk it, truly. He has four children who rely on him. I thought there was a wife. There is, but... Surely she can look after them. Oh, that's just where you're wrong. She's no help there. She's quite immature. Extremely jealous. Even of her own children. Isn't that so? Yes. From the information I was given it would appear that the opposite were true. Mrs. Longman is spoken of as a most sympathetic woman. Oh, that's a false impression. You've no idea how much Longman has to look after her. She's a great liability. Isn't that so? She's quite unbalanced. You don't mind me telling him this, do you Longman? No. Apart from the insane jealousies and hysterics she's, well, quite frankly, she's almost a tart. Apart from that, if you want to know the gory details he hasn't found her attractive in the physical sense for many years. I know that from him himself. There are other things that repulse him. Sense of smell, touch, you know. He's never loved her at all. Have you, Longman? You've never loved her. Have you? Norman, for god's sake, ambulance! What the hell have you made me do? He's been in the tank. It's Longman. Yes. My dear man, you must lie down. Now please lie down. - Why should I lie down? I'm perfectly all right. I never felt better in my life. What's going on? Get these youngsters to clear out of the way. Now move along, will you? For heaven's sake, you're educated people, aren't you? Now look here, I don't know what faculty you belong to or what your colleges are, but we can do without your encouragement. Now get along at once. I've been really worried, Doctor. Thank god you're all right. I can't think why. I've never felt better. There's a lot that needs explaining 'round about here. Longman, you've been unconscious for some time. Yeah, well, I'm not now. Let's get out of here, come on. Good god. Norman, get those blokes to haul me back in there. Come on you pallbearers take me back. Come on, hurry up, hurry up. Oh, don't hang about. Now there's no need to be angry. Look, you'd be angry if you woke up in the quad, stark bloody naked. Are you looking for Dr. Longman? Yes, I had a phone message just now. I saw the ambulance. I don't think you need worry. He looked hearty enough. He refused to get into it. They're back in isolation with him now. Thank you very much. - Normal? - Normal. I'd be surprised if it wasn't. - All right? - Sound as a bell. Good morning, Major. I'm glad to hear it very glad. I shall tell your wife, Longman. You're to go away now for a long holiday. Travelling, fishing, anything you like, but complete relaxation. I'm shocked by all of you. You too, Major. No man should have been subjected to isolation, for that length of time. There's still some loose ends to be tied up on today's work. - No. - Yes, but look... - Don't argue with him now. I'll talk to him later. I won't have any protests or whisperings. You should understand an order, when it's given, Major. It may be a disappointment to you, but that's my decision. I wish you all goodnight. Good morning. It's only nine p.m. - I don't believe you. - He's right enough. It's exactly nine o'clock. Nine o'clock at night? This is terrible. This is the most terrible anticlimax. This is the mountain bringing forth the mouse. I could swear it was breakfast time tomorrow and all it is is supper time today. We've been through the whole cabaret, the kicking and the shouting and the screaming, and all I feel like is eggs and bacon and coffee. I'm sorry. You two look like a couple of burglars. Obviously, we prefer to keep you under observation for a couple of days. - I think it would be wise. - I think it'd be nonsense. There's nothing wrong with me. I'm perfectly all right. I know what happened. I remember it all. And what a clever idea. That's our Major. Or was it your idea? No, no, I promise. I was very worried... - Oh you're always worried. You always worry. Well, there's no need to worry any more. Everything's all right. Your experiment didn't work. The tank isn't such an ogre, Major. Otter. Are you sure you're all right? I'm even clean behind the ears. I was so desperately worried. They phoned me. Just before I lifted the receiver I was certain there was going to be bad news. About five minutes before, I had a horrible premonition. Well, not now, not now. Look, later, later on. We're all right. All you have to do now is take me away from here and cook me a late evening breakfast. May I leave, Dr. Tate? No questions. Major Hall? Enjoy your eggs and bacon. Thank you very much, Norman. Norman, just a minute. The last time Professor Sharpey did this experiment were you with him? - Yes, I worked the tapes. - And fished him out? - That's right. After how long? Oh, about four hours. What was his condition? Well, he was pretty dazed, but he seemed to recover. He insisted that I took him to the station. He had the lecture to go to in London. That day? He seems to have taken it better than Professor Longman. Well, he didn't get the third degree treatment. - Do you want me to drive? - No, why? I thought you might be tired waiting that's all. I did feel awful, but I feel marvellous now. No breakfast for me. A large gin. Celebration? Certainly. An experiment like this to have failed makes the day an unqualified success. Not for you, I'd have thought or Sharpey. Sharpey's dead. As Longman said it's just a question of closing the file. T for traitor. That's almost all. Almost? I still have to find what he sold. How? When bewildered, majors report back to their colonels. You are tired. Calder's quite right for once. A holiday. We'll go fishing somewhere on a deserted island. Where the skies are cloudy all day. You look younger, I think. Love me? Of course I do. I've got something to tell you. Guess. What sort of thing? You're awfully dim, really. I'm pregnant. That's not bad, is it? Well, of course it isn't bad. I'm very happy about it. You really are the most extraordinary girl. No girl. You drag me here 10 miles to tell me that. I'm sure you know why we came out here. You remember the first day we drove here? The day it all started. The day... - Yes I remember. Perhaps it wasn't such a good place to come after all. That weeping willow. I wish we hadn't come here, at all. You're getting all weird and gay. Longman, love me. Just now a cold hand reached inside and clutched. Love you. For god's sake where are you? Shall we go? Hello. How's the raft, the Kon-Tiki? Oh, that, that's all finished. We've been around since then. We've been away for months. We've been to seven different countries. France, Italy. Is your father in? He's always in. Tate. A message from Dr. Calder, I suppose? No. Come in. Longman's in there. Look, this isn't an official visit. Is something wrong? Nothing. Aren't you coming in? Answer the gentleman. Oh, Hello. Oonagh. It's amazing, isn't it, the effect of pregnancy on a woman? She's been shuffling up and down those stairs for weeks. How do you think she looks? - Very well. - You're being complimented. Come down. Come on, come down. All the way. Nobody's going to bite you. I used to call her Otter, sometimes. That was in the days of amour, amour, amour. Would you like a cup of coffee? No thanks, I haven't really time. I was just going to tell you that... That I'm bloody lazy and I ought to go back and do some teaching. So right, you are. I wonder why I don't. Life here isn't exactly a garden of roses. I've been busy reorganising a house, which our bohemian friend here had, not to put too strong a point on it, let slip. Tate really thinks you look well. I haven't seen you since you came back. Oh, I sent you an invitation to a party. No? RSVP. - Well, my dear, you... - I showed it to you. Oh. - I'm sorry, Tate. - God, you're so dishonest. You're so dishonest. All women aren't dishonest, are they Tate? It's tonight. Are you coming? You've got time, haven't you? I really don't feel very much like a party tonight, Tate. More resting. Oh, yes, of course. Well, it's on the barge. There's plenty to drink if you change your mind. Well, I certainly shan't change my mind. I shall come, what time is it? It's around eight. There are fireworks, all that. Well, I've still got a lot of drink to buy, so. See him to the door. Otter. It's a term of endearment. See him to the garden gate, if you like. Talk to him. Tell him all about it. Whisper in his ear yackety yackety yack. Oonagh, I... Bye bye. Three six, sir. Thank you. Oh, hello, Major. Hello, Norman, are you helping out? Well, technically, I believe I'm a guest. Here you are. This is to proof you against wind and frost. - Where's Dr. Tate? - Hm? Oh, I think he's in there somewhere. Hey, you're not here officially, are you? No, no, no, purely socially. Ah. Here we are. Get some of this down your bloody throat. Who's that young lady walking the plank? Oh, that's Annabelle, from the barge next door. She's said to be part of a gentleman's education. Eaton, Oxford and Annabelle. Pirate's proposal? Your choice, say yes or I'll shove you over. Oh, the stutterings of man. Yes. With this glass, I thee wed. Oh, no, that one makes me sad. It's got such a nasty end. All right, then burial at sea. Mm, that's much more cheerful. Well, it's certainly a party, isn't it? I'm mad at you. Now what have I done? I've been waiting all week for you. I've never met you before. That's why I'm mad. Oh dear. Shh, another couple. That's no couple. That's my wife. Oh, well, it is just a party, isn't it? That's no party, that's my wife. You know, she's practically a tart. - No. - She is. It's just booze, really. Just that. Come on, don't cry. Oh, cry? It's the bloody Oxford party even if I'm giving it. Annabelle's a fair enough girl. You know, she wouldn't... Oh, do you really think it's Annabelle that worries me? Oh, Tate. Hello. Oh, hello, Major. Oh, you've got a drink? Norman saw to it. - You know him? - We've met. Good evening. Well, you enjoying yourself? I wish I could say I was. I've just arrived. And I've already seen rather more than I bargained for. Oh, it's just a party, Major. Just the booze. Just one of those things. Ask Tate. Just one of those nights. I'd be happy to believe that. Since when, has your husband behaved like this? Not now. If you really want to know, since that night six months ago when he asked me for breakfast. And you two happily vanished. Mrs. Longman, I don't know how much you know of the isolation experiment. It was clear the experiment didn't work. Tate, please. You did something to him. It wasn't just the tank. It didn't work. Yes, we did. Twisted him somewhere. Why didn't you get in touch with me? Oh, don't blame him, Major. Not on that account, anyway. I've been very British, Major. Very stiff upper lip. Just your sort of girl. British, when he started on, about the children. Just needling at first for a laugh. Then the holiday. Oh, the fishing wasn't a success so we tried the other alternative, travelling. More than needling now, and love turning into something else. Oh, you should have been there. We had a ghastly scene in every capital in Europe. Can you give me one example? It's important. Oh. I can give you a 100. Malaga. Madrid. Perpignan. Worse in Paris. But Amsterdam. One example. In Amsterdam the prostitutes sit in kind of, in shop windows. Little sort of bourgeois rooms. Chest of drawers, antimacassars, aspidistras. All behind glass, they sit and nod like dolls. Longman bought one one night. Oh, Tate, just another party, just the booze, just one of those nights. Do you mean to say in front of you he bought this woman? Oh, no. No, he didn't buy her. That would've been too easy. Too normal. No, he bought the room. The window. That's what he bought for his wife. To put me in it. Can you imagine the picture? A lewd cartoon. Me like this in the window. Too much. Norman! That man there! Oh, buzz off. Did they say where they were going? No, not to me. Does Mrs. Longman know? Where do boffins go when the grass is wet? A Little Hut. The lab? He's got a key. See if you can borrow a car. All right. Are you going after him? Is that really necessary? Of course, we must. Can't you see what's happened? The experiment last summer wasn't a failure. When a woman's pregnant she can imagine things. You've seen him tonight. He's drunk. It's a party. For god's sake, man, can't you believe your own eyes? He's gone off. I think I know where. I'm going after him. But first, I want to tell you what I'm going to do before we bring him back to you. I don't think I want to see him. I believe you want to see him very much. What you don't want to see is the man who calls himself Longman now. Now, that's exactly how it is. I'm going after him. I'm going to play back the tape recording of the interrogation to which Tate and I subjected him after he he'd been in that tank for nearly eight hours. In that way, we shall start the process of his readjustment. We shall bring back the real man. I want to come with you. No, no, no, you can't do that. Why not? There were things said as part of the interrogation, deliberate lies about you. It would be very wrong for you to hear them. Don't you see? I have to hear them. I have to know. Oh, glamorous night. Now here's a cheerful spot. This must be the most sophisticated nightclub I ever saw. What are we going to do? Ew, the imagination boggles. Oh, stop talking. Well, I feel we must communicate. Perhaps it's this padded cell. Then communicate without speech. I must talk, else I'll scream. That's fine, scream. Go ahead, scream. Make all the noises of love. And they'll refuse to echo. This is a wonderful place. It's a trysting house. It's soundproofed and original and this is a bath. A bath in case you require extra treatment. And you can have music too. Astounding recordings. Symphonies, played only on a bassoon. What's wrong? Here we are, cabaret time in the lab, you can have Longman screaming, Longman crying as a boy, Longman sexy, if that appeals. All the noises of Noah, love. Less rapturous, but altogether more passionate. Listen. You're not really weird? Of course not that's just a cabaret. A little exercise. A demonstration in all the passions we've bottled up inside ourselves. Everybody does, you too. Please, switch it off. If it's a joke, I really don't like it. And if it isn't a joke I think I'm scared out of my wits. Of course it's a joke. It's the greatest joke, the biggest. All that yelling, all that just gives you a healthy appetite for breakfast. Bacon and eggs. Nothing else. And, little woman either way, you'd better humour me. Turn it off. Put on the other tape. Are you all right? - Fine. - Go away. Berlin's night life has come to Oxford. Longman, I want you to listen carefully Mrs. Longman, in a moment, on that tape you will hear the interview I told you about. Your husband being interrogated, by Dr. Tate and myself after he came out of the tank. This is the part of the experiment, of which he had no knowledge. The wrong tree. The major's barking up the wrong tree. The man's tired. For God's sake, he knows my name's Tate as well as li know his is Longman. It's quite clear there's nothing to be gained by cross examination at this stage. There's only one course. No, I don't think you're right. Not necessarily for as long again. No, no, he was at the limit. I'm not going back in there again. Oh, no, no, of course you're not. Well, then tell him to get away. Tell him to get out, the bloody man! You seem to forget your responsibilities, Dr. Longman. We are conducting a controlled experiment. As adviser to that experiment I think it would be wisest to put you back in the tank for a further period. Don't let him do it, don't let him do it, don't let him do it! I promise, I promise, I promise. We can't risk it, truly. He has four children who rely on him. I thought there was a wife. There is, but... Surely she can look after them. Oh, that's just where you're wrong. She's no help there. She's quite immature, extremely jealous, even of her own children. Isn't that so? Yes. From the information I was given it would appear that the opposite were true. Mrs. Longman is spoken of as a most sympathetic woman. Oh, that's a false impression. You've no idea how much Longman has to look after her. She's a great liability. Isn't that so? She's quite unbalanced. You don't mind me telling him this, do you Longman? No. Apart from her insane jealousies and hysterics, she's, well quite frankly, she's almost a tart. And apart from that, if you want to know the gory details he hasn't found her attractive in the physical sense, for many years. I know that from him himself. There are other things that repulse him. Sense of smell, touch, you know. He's never loved her at all. Have you, Longman? You've never loved her. Have you? Norman! For god's sake, ambulance! What the hell have you made me do? Did you listen? Yes, of course I listened. Then you recognised the technique of indoctrination? Do you begin to understand why you've been behaving to your wife like this? I told you. I told you you're barking up the wrong tree. I'm sorry, Major. I'm sorry. Oh! Abracadabra! Svengali didn't pull it off. I know the whole questionnaire by heart. But you're failing to understand it. Have you forgotten why you went into that tank? To prove that when a man comes out of it he's a different creature. A soulless, will-less thing susceptible to whatever might be put into his mind? Don't you see that Tate was only acting. Your friend. That he and I were deliberately poisoning your mind against your wife. Of course I see that. Do you think you've got the monopoly on mind bending in Whitehall? Or wherever you practise? A kind of hangman. I suppose that's what you are. I twigged what you were doing from the start. I was too exhausted to laugh and I mean laugh. Couldn't you see that you were converting the converted? All this stuff about her. Irresponsible, immature, not very good with the children. All that bunk. I knew that. You asked me once about the files we keep. I could find 20 people to testify that you and your wife were about the happiest couple in Oxford. - So, we pretended. - I didn't. Well, so I pretended then. I admit I bluffed myself. I admit that. Midnight picnics. The big stuff. Amour, amour. That's the picture of a husband trying to keep up the bluff. - No. - Oh, god damn it. I know! I'm speaking about myself. That's not true, either. Don't you see we made you into another person? Bunk. Your experiment didn't even work except to make me live a long time in a single afternoon so I come to it quicker. And here it is. The point of truth. Our little party's over. I love you. And we haven't come to the point of truth. More midnight picnics? 40 days and 40 nights? That wasn't what I was thinking of. That was a journey from a firm base. The firm base was a love that lasted 14 years. Hey, Annabelle. Annabelle. Annabelle, wait. Let them go. He won't hurt her. - He mustn't drive. He'll be all right. Oonagh. I don't know what to say to you. I'm so ashamed. I can't... What are you really trying to say? You baby. I didn't know until I saw you hurt. - You're lying. - I swear it's true. I didn't know last summer. I'd never have agreed to the experiment if I had, I promise. It was only tonight when I saw you on the barge. At the earliest, when I saw you at your house. I knew how much I missed you. I was frightened. Nobody can be blamed for falling in love. You are a baby. I'd do anything for you. Please believe me. A baby. I want you to believe me, when I tell you that I'll get him back if I have to play that tape to him 100 times. You can't order him to listen to it, Major. I think I'll go home now. I'll take you. No, thank you. Mrs. Longman, I really don't think you should go home alone. He's been near enough to murder before. What difference is there in tonight? There might be. I'd rather you didn't risk it. There isn't really any risk. When you think that I'd rather be killed by him than live without him. He'll come back. I'm quite sure of that. There are some instincts in Longman like everybody else that are indestructible. no matter what you, or Tate or science, may do to him. Explain to me why the hell didn't you get in touch with me? - They'd been abroad. - Not all the time. I couldn't see them. It was your business, to see them. For god's sake they're only half a mile up the road. I couldn't, I know I should. I said I couldn't. I think I see. Don't know that I'd have done anything about it except murder her husband. You didn't do that. I may miss love, but I don't miss lies. You didn't go into this thing with any conscious idea of doing Longman harm. That makes it worse, don't you see? I can't even recognise my own motives. I hate that sort of person. Then you hate the young. Come on. You're too intelligent for me to have to play big brother. Whatever we did, was my responsibility. The worst you've done is to fool yourself. Face it is and you'll soon grow up to be as thick skinned as I am. Let me come with you, please. You're going home to bed alone. One cigarette, I want to talk to you. - Oh, stop it. - Please. Please, Annabelle, Annabelle wait. Wait, wait. No wait, I won't be violent. - No. Annabelle, please, listen. I'm bushed. I don't want to hear. I'm not going to bore you with the complicated people who have bashed and bruised my life. If I were charitable I might listen to yours, but a year or two ago Annabelle bought herself a houseboat and opted to give charity the boot. You're very attractive. That's it. And I have every limb and organ that a girl should have. Except one. I no longer have a shoulder to weep on. A Polish gentleman wore it away with his tears. Goodnight, little boy. Oh, you dreadful big sad dog. You remind me of a man. Go away. Don't look at me so trustingly. You're nothing but a series of conditioned reflexes. That's all you are, you're not a dog at all. I could lock you up and train you. I'd ring a bell, and your mouth would water. Ring another one and you'd bark. You're just a machine in furry clothing, that's all. But if it's any comfort to you we're beginning to prove that your master's much the same only he hasn't got a furry coat. Oh, don't look now, Here comes nanny. May I sit down? That's a matter between you and The Thames Conservancy Board. How'd you get here? I walked. A horribly brave little thing. You remind me of a war widow selling Red Cross flags on a cold afternoon. If you want to kill me you only have to push. I love you. God knows where you are. Oh, for Pete's sake. Come on, come on. Please wait for me, please. I can't, the dog's too fast. Please, wait. Why? Because it'd suit me. All right, come along. Come along, back to the love nest. Stop! Get up! What's the matter? God, it's yours too, isn't it? Is the child coming? Well, just, don't just weep. Answer! I don't know. You must, you must know. You must know, think. I don't care. I don't care. Annabelle, Annabelle! Annabelle, help, it's Oonagh. Oh. Thank you Annabelle, where's the bed? What happened? She fell. Fell? I pushed her. I forgot about the baby. Go, clear out, go on you tramp. Get out. - Out, shoo. You'll be fine, you'll be all right. Is the baby coming? - Yes, my breasts, please. - Oh yes. - Where's your telephone? - I haven't one. Well is there one on the next boat? No. There's a box about half a mile upstream by the bridge. - I better take the car. - No. - Can you drive? - No. If you leave me, Longman, I know I shall die. Please, it'd kill me. Are you hurt? Are the pains normal? If you stay, no pain. Look, I'll run to the phone. It won't take long. There are things to get, first. Look, Oonagh, leave go, will you please? Please, promise you'll stay with me. Yes I promise, but leave go of me. Do I boil kettles? - What? - Do I boil kettles? - What the hell for? - Well, I don't know, I just heard... I wouldn't know what to do with all that boiling water. I want clean sheets. What else have you got here? A hot water bottle? - It's in the bed. Go on. Sure. And there are rules about hygiene. I want some disinfectant. Okay. When you've got all those things hop out and ring the nearest witch doctor. All through? Yes. Well, that's good. That's right and proper. I remember the text. On your side. There you are. Give your back a bit of a rub, hm? I've always rather fancied this osteopath racket. I knew one once. A bit too free with his hands. A fat deb's mother got him struck off. Altogether too much temptation he said in court. She was at least 15 stone. - Is this all? - Yes, dump it on the table. Tell the doctor I think we're at the end of the first stage. What does that mean? That's what I like about English girls, their education. You'd better hurry. - Is it all right? - Yes, of course, of course. She's not a beginner. She's done it before, she'll do it again. I'll run. I wonder what Annabelle's washing facilities are like. Hygienic, I hope. And I hope I know what I'm doing. Anyway, you can always shout at me, if I, if I forget anything. Oh, no, not cheerful now. Damn these collapsible, I only need to put my foot in the wrong place and you'll be the first woman to have a baby on her head. Easy, easy, easy. We'll need all the energy you have for the grand finale. Want a glass of water, hm? Here you are. Beside this, I've never conducted the oldest physiological experiment in the world before. Down you go. On your back. Big stuff. Adam and Eve. No, no, no. No, wait a minute, loosen, loosen. Loosen, loosen. Loosen, darling, loosen, that's it, that's it. Oh, my. Now look, don't talk. Don't talk, otherwise I'll cuff you one, haul him out with the tongs. Then you'll be sorry. I do you believe you're getting excited. Okay now, clench your fists. Tight, tight. Now take a deep breath. Right in, deep in. Hold it. Come on, shove, shove, shove. Shove, come on. Don't fade on us now, love, don't fade, you. Very good, very good. Brakes, brakes, brakes, brakes. Don't push, don't push. Hold it now. Hold it. Can you see him? We're all right. Another little push. Easy does it. A little push. Very good, steady, easy, easy, easy, easy. All right, all right. All right, again. Don't knock the man out. Can you move up the bed a little? Just a bit. Do you know how fast they have to cope with all the problems. Likewise. All right now. Scouting for boys. Born on a barge. P for what? Pedro the Fisherman, you'd better be. Come on, young man. You stay there. Longman. Up you come. There you are. Every comfort. You're just in time. Get every linen box and basket you can find. Otherwise we shall be accused of murder. And some more sheets. It's a boy. Hurry, will you? The doctor's on his way. Longman, it's not just as a doctor? Are you the doctor? Well, if I am, if I am there's going to be one hell of a scandal because I'm going to be struck off all the lists. That isn't all sweat, is it? No, darling. Not all. In, out, in, out! Seven, push it back! Stretch yourself, man, back! Oh, so sorry. Not bad, not bad! Troop, put the rage out of it. Yes, sir, we, we! In, out! In, out! In, out! I don't know why we're shaking hands. He's congratulating you. Well, I'll go below. Is there anything special I ought to give her? Give her anything, anything she likes. Give her caviar, but don't give the baby that. I could cry for a week. I think it's wonderful. Perhaps I'm getting too old. Just a spinster, but I could laugh and cry for a week. I know what's going on in that head of yours, but have a little faith, Major. I've come through all right. I've come through. Never mind about that. What you did was right. Well, you can say that, now. In as far as it affects poor Sharpey. We know now what that tank did to him. And that's what his friends found out. They simply told him what to do and he did it. So it's Zed for zombie and not T for traitor? I'll refile it with pleasure. You must be tired. Yes, I am tired. I'm tired of the stupidity, which makes a crime out of discovery. You start off with honest scientific inquiry and you end up with a poor innocent old man lying dead on the cinder track on a dark night by a dirty train. I want some breakfast. Are you coming? Bacon and eggs? This time, I think I can assure you that it's morning.
