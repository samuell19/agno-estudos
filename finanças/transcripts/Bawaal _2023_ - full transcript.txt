Here are some evergreen songs for our evergreen listeners. "How I spend my days..." "Don't weep, my forlorn heart..." "Calm down, for--" "I've vowed to make you mi--" "For your favours, for your generosity..." And now, it's time for a peppy number. Ajju Bro. 'A rare white pigeon amongst grey ones -' 'that's Ajju Bro for you.' 'A personality so magnetic,' 'he attracts attention wherever he goes.' 'He's a scene-stealer.' 'Ajju Bro is a celebrity for sure,' 'but what's his field of work, can you guess?' 'A high-ranking police officer?' 'No.' 'A district collector?' 'No.' 'An investment banker?' 'Uh-uh.' 'A news anchor?' 'A youth leader?' 'An upcoming actor?' 'So what does he actually do?' 'He is a high school teacher.' Sir! Sir, I'll park it in shade and put it on the main stand. 'So you might ask, how does a teacher manage to command such respect? - 'I'll tell you how.' - Good morning, sir. 'Ajju Bro sowed the seed of lies across the pious land of Lucknow,' 'and managed to grow a big image for himself.' You know Ajju sir almost got into NASA, if not for that cursed tempo driver who hit him and broke his tailbone? So how is he still working? Through sheer willpower. - You know Ajay sir almost became a collector? - Then? While writing appearing for the exam it struck him - If he becomes a collector, Lucknow will have just one collector. But if he becomes a teacher, he can give Lucknow 100 collectors. - Then? - Then what! He tore his answer sheet and left the hall. Right turn! One... two, three, one! You know sir almost became an army officer? Then? He got a throat infection on the day of the interview. He ran fast, but couldn't say anything. You gotta agree, he's got a great physique! I agree. If you want to pump your arms, work on your triceps, instead of your biceps. The biceps has one muscle, this one, whereas the triceps has three, this one, this one, and this one. 'There is no place he doesn't like to share his knowledge.' Touch it. Hard as stone. Riding your bike sans undies will blow up your joints. Daily use of gel will make your hair go dry, like a broom. There's a special powder... that I use. Grace is surely important when it comes to dancing, but the face is very-very-very important. Yes, sir. 'And the place where he should actually be imparting knowledge,' 'is the place where he goes only to kill time.' The Second World War took place between 1939 and 1945. The majority of the countries participated in it, including all the superpowers. Not fair, Papon! You took Hardik and asked me to take Krunal. I asked you to go for Pandya, sir. You choose the wrong one. I chose wrong, right! - You keep reading. - Yes, sir. - You keep a watch. - Yes, sir. And you keep wri-- Keep writing, my boy. Does Dhoni really have 16 bikes? Uh-uh, 18! Sir, why didn't you become a cricketer? Tennis elbow. - It's still a little stiff-- - 'Everyone thinks that Ajju Bro is great.' 'There are only a few who know that he is--' He's a fake, sir. Not again, Mr. Pandey. Sir, I want to end this drama, once and for all. This man is not a history teacher, he is a mystery teacher. He doesn't know what he is teaching. And you know everything? Yes, I do. If you don't believe me, then come with me and see it for yourself. He's coming! Go! Go! Back to your seats! Go, go... During the Second World War, Hitler had... Hitler had...? Shobit! Hitler had... done what? He invaded Poland first, sir. Very good. Oh sir, you?! Good. Sit down. Did you need me? No. You continue. Mr. Pandey, I hope you understood the theorem I explained yesterday. Which theorem? How can you forget so soon? No problem, I'll sit with you after school. I love to stay back after school. I can spare some time for you too. Learn something from him, Mr. Pandey. He is lying, sir. He didn't teach me any theorem. Just let it be. You love to make up stories. 'Everyone was totally impressed by Ajju Bro,' 'but he is totally depressed by himself.' Bro, you remember Vineet Shajapurkar? Vineet Shajapurkar? You'd poured glue down his undies. - His family jewels got stuck together. - Right! What happened? He's kicked the bucket? No, bro. He's a big shot now. Works for a pharma company. I don't remember his title, but he's second from the top. What happened? I would've been on the top, you know if only my father had paid the donation. What am I doing now? A meaningless job in a worthless school. Those who used to be behind me are now racing ahead. Prateek Richchariya drives a Honda City, whereas I drive a Bullet. Ratan Ghanghoriya has 10 dumpers on the road. Makes 20,000 a day! Drop one. Ricky Lamba married Miss Kanpur. And my marriage... bloody got misfired. What are you saying? - The truth. - That's not true. You know everyone in Lucknow looks up to you. They look up to me because of the image I've maintained. People only see what I show them. The day they see the truth... no one will bother to give me a second glance. You and your negativity. Bro, negative thoughts manifest negative things. Your dad's calling. Answer it. You want to talk to him? - I'm just telling you. - Let it ring. No issues, let it ring. Your job should make you want to go to work. And your home should make you want to go rushing back to it. In my case, none of them don't fit the bill. Oh, Ajju... - you're home! - No, I'm still on the streets. You'll soon be on the streets, sonny boy. You see, the way you're going... I see it every day. Then see this as well. Your credit card bill. I'll settle it. - He's finally home. - No, he's still on the streets. Should I serve dinner? He's downed a few drinks. I'm sure he must have eaten... What, Chicken Lollipop? You should tell me in advance. The street dogs are going fat eating your share of food. - Mummy... - Also tell us who is going to pay this bill, because I won't give you a single penny for it. I don't expect you to. - What did you say? - I don't expect you to. Hey... don't puke in the sink. Go puke in the pot. I'm not puking. I'm just washing my face. I have control, Mummy. You have no control. The delivery guys ring the bell every two hours with a parcel in hand. Shoes. Goggles. Expensive undies. Whom do you show these undies to, huh? They are mine. Why do they bother you? Why does he have a problem with my undies? Listen... just have a lemon. Give it to him. He has been nagging since the moment I stepped in. Me having a lemon won't sober you down! In an attempt to fool the world, you are actually trying to fool yourself. Yes, I am. Hey... how about some dessert? I don't want to eat anything. Give it to me, or it'll go waste. You've got a blood sugar levels of 180. He's why my blood sugar levels spikes! Yes, blame me for everything. I'm going. Don't make any noise, Nisha is sleeping. Why'd I want to wake her up? To dance? Huh? Say what? He hadn't had his fill troubling us, he'll now go and trouble her as well. When will he change? Oh, you woke up? Now, go sleep on the floor. It's Tuesday. It's my turn to sleep on the bed. Go, go. Fast, fast. 'It's been 9 months since their wedding,' 'but the only thing that grew between them was the distance.' 'Nisha was very happy before she married Ajju.' 'She was independent,' 'outgoing,' 'happy,' 'and a tad unfortunate,' 'because as a child, she used to get fits.' 'And so, she managed to have friends, but not boyfriends.' 'That's why Nisha had decided,' 'she'd spend her life with the one who fully understands her.' 'Then Ajju came into her life... with his beautiful fa√ßade.' 'Nisha saw all those qualities in Ajju... that he wanted her to see.' Aunty... can I address you as Mummy? 'Respectful towards elders.' 'Love for children.' 'Smart and friendly.' 'And Ajju saw all those qualities in Nisha that he'd like to show the world.' 'Business class family.' 'First class education.' 'Top class wife.' 'Before things could go further,' 'Nisha disclosed the most important fact about herself.' I have epilepsy. Epi-lep-sy? Nice. I used to fits when I was a kid. You know fits? 'There were a lot of benefits of getting married to Nisha,' 'with close to none drawbacks.' Do you still get them? Haven't had any for the last 10 years. Oh. I too used to eat dirt as a kid. Do you still eat it? Haven't had any for the last 20 years. "I found you and I found my shore," "My heart sought just a drop," "and I got a river of my own," "After meeting you, my heart was sure," "No one was more important in my life anymore," "Without you my life was incomplete, you know," "My lonely heart kept wandering, looking for you high and low," "Our lonely hearts," "Brought together by God," "Oh, my love," "I want to grow old with you," "With you..." "Our lonely hearts," "Brought together by God," "Oh, my love," "All I want to say is that I belong to you," "They call out to me," "They attract me," "Your subtle gestures..." "I've surrendered my world to you," "Now I won't be able to survive without you," "After meeting you, my heart was sure," "No one was more important in my life anymore," "Without you my life was incomplete, you know," "My lonely heart kept wandering, looking for you high and low," "Our lonely hearts," "Brought together by God," "Oh, my love," "I want to grow old with you," "With you..." "Our lonely hearts," "Brought together by God," "Oh, my love," "All I want to say is that I belong to you," "Show me your face, my lovely bride," "My yearning eyes need some respite," "Have some mercy on me, " "My eyes are desperate to see thee," "Nothing is mine anymore, everything I have belongs to you," "You are my world..." "Our lonely hearts," "Brought together by God," "Oh, my love," "I want to grow old with you," Uncle, please get them to send the bride soon or I'll blow up. Why did you have to have so many sweets? Come on, it's my big brother's wedding. How can I not eat sweets?! Find out how much longer it'll take. I'll go and check, Papa. - I-- - No, I'll go. Keep it open. Don't worry, son. She'll be fine in no time. Well... I was tense about the wedding, I was tired, and I was obviously nervous. I think I forgot to take the pill. This is the first time it happened in 10 years. 'If what happened behind closed doors' 'had happened in front of everyone,' 'then it would've ruined his image.' 'Fearing that' 'Ajju never took Nisha out.' How do I look? It's a boys' night out. Stay home. You'll get bored there. Can I come along? Couldn't you ask before? I'll get late now. Come, dear, I'll make you some tea. Ajju, why don't you two go on a vacation? I'm busy. Why don't you all go on a vacation? There's a new movie showing in the theatre. I don't like to watch movies. 'You are such a scoundrel.' 'That's what mom says too.' What have I done wrong? Why are you so indifferent toward me? Did I ever hit you? Did I ever call you names? Everything is fine. Don't do unnecessary drama. I'm doing drama?! Yes, you are! Did you ever take me to a movie? Did you ever take me to a mall? Did you ever introduce me to your friend? Did we ever go shopping together? Have we ever done anything together, Ajay? There is nothing like a husband and wife between us. How can we? Why not? You know why not! I told you about the fits before we got married. I also told you why I got one on the day of our wedding. And I haven't got another one since that day! But what is the guarantee that you won't get another one? You can easily get tired, not take your pill, get nervous again, and go into vibrating pose in front of the whole city, and I'll lose my image-- I would've left you if I wasn't so worried about my image. 'Now they just stay together and tolerate each other.' Listen, come home early today. You need to drop Nisha at her parents' place. I'm not dropping anyone anywhere. Drop her, right! Hey! Why won't you drop her, huh? This is the first wedding at her place after your marriage. - So? - People will talk. Let them talk. I don't care. Why can't you go? What are you busy with, huh? Shooting pumpkins? Unlike you, I'm not a banker who counts other people's money. Right, your job profile includes getting drunk and driving your bike aimlessly. Exams are around the corner. I need to set the question paper. Set your life first. It's my life, I'll handle it. Look, I don't know about others, but my parents will not like this. You can pick me up instead. I'm not going to come and you know why. Is this the way to talk to her?! She is your wife! Why does everyone in this house love to nag? You guys make me lose my mind. Now maintain social distance and let me pass. - Hey... - Move. Learn to face your problems rather - than run away from them! - Yes, I'm running away. Idiot. Sir is here. - Sir... - Hmm? Sir, I think you should take Chahal. Get lost. What are you staring at? Open your books. Sir... Hmm? - Sir, I had a doubt. - What is it? Sir, in Second World War concentration camps, why would they strip the prisoners before sending them into gas chambers? This won't be asked in the exams. Sir, then please tell us for general knowledge's sake. I told you this won't be asked. Sit down. Sir, if you don't know then say so. Why are you avoiding it? Does this clear your doubt? Sit down. It doesn't matter how much your mother-in-law loves you, or how much your father-in-law takes care of you. This relationship is meaningless without your husband by your side. It's not so, Ma. You don't look like the girl we sent there, dear. The day you feel you cannot continue with this relationship... Just come home. No one will question you. Divorce is not a bad thing, dear. It doesn't take long to break a relationship, Ma. I want to give this relationship some more time. I have some hope left. The day that breaks, I'll come back. How do I look? Beautiful as ever. Heard you whacked a student? Have you never? I have, sir... but never a legislator's son. Good thing I didn't tell you that outside, or you would've peed in your pants. You've certainly caused a Fiasco, bro. Who told you? You do something and the news doesn't spread like wildfire? Is that even possible? You're making waves across the city. "Ajju Bro whacked the legislator's son." You have any contact with this legislator? Help me settle this. You are my contact, bro. Let me know if I can help you with anything else. I'll be there for you. It won't be an issue. Ajju Bro, listen up... Ajju Bro...! Come on, Ajju Bro...! Ajay, don't you worry at all. I'll fix this. Listen... Mr. Bhadoriya is on the line. - Mr. Bhadoriya? - Yes. Mr. Bhadoriya! Hello, Mr. Bhadoriya! Yes, I'm doing well. I just needed a small favour. Don't worry, Ajju. Your dad's trying to fix this. If nothing works, I'll go and beg at the legislator's feet. Mummy, please. What else do I do? Mr. Bhadoriya won't be able to help. He bluntly refused. Then talk to Mr. Kurele. He has a saving account with your bank. His having a saving account doesn't mean he can save my son! You speak without thinking. What about Mr. Malaiyya? He's in the opposition party. It'll only make things worse. Then Ajju...? Papa, my mom has sent Kurtas for you and... What's wrong? He has made a mistake, sir. I agree. He shouldn't have raised his hand at him. Ajay Dikshit is a competent and talented teacher. We've never received any complaints against him, sir. Mr. Ajay Dikshit? Sorry, sir. Principal, will you be okay if I break your bones in front of everyone, then take you to a corner and apologise? You know Section 17(1) and 17(2) of the Right to Education act? Hitting a student is a punishable offense. Either you take action against him or I'll take action against you. Whatever you want, sir. Form a disciplinary committee that investigates impartially and decides whether he is fit to teach in this school or any other school. And until then... keep him suspended. 'Lucknow's Horizon World School's teacher Ajay Dikshit was suspended' 'for one month today, for slapping a student.' 'A disciplinary committee will now investigate this matter.' 'Everyone in the city is strongly condemning this incident.' This is serious matter now, bro. Hmm. The committee could put you in a fix. I just shouldn't lose my job. There is no shortage of jobs for you in this city, bro. It wouldn't have been a problem if I'd quit the job on my own. If I lose my job, all the hard work I'd put into building my image will go down the drain. So what do you plan to do, bro? You remember the Gold Cup Cricket Tournament we played in high school? We were facing Team Hardoi in the semi-finals. Of course, I remember. You had made such great arrangements for it. You got mats from Delhi. You asked the municipality to send water tankers to water the ground. You even had the road rollers to smooth the pitch. You'd put up floodlights across the stadium. You gave players 14 t-shirts and caps with their names on them. You know Bunty? - He stole 2 of these t-shirts. - I see. What a great match it was, bro! Do you remember how many runs I scored? You... Ajju! Ajju! Ajju! Ajju! Ajju! Ajju! I don't remember the exact figure, but you scored 70-80 runs for sure. Only 5 runs. - Noo! - Hmm. What are you saying?! One should create such an ambience that people remember ambience, but not the result. I'll have to do something big. But you are suspended, how do you plan to create the ambience? I'll think of something. You too get thinking. All I can think of is that you didn't score just 5 runs for sure. Can I help? No. Fine. Good night. How's it going, Papon? Same old, same old, sir. The other classes are running as per schedule, but we do get to have a lot of fun - in your class. - Why? They turned your History Class into Games Period. You'll have to skip the World War Two portion. You were supposed to cover that this month. It won't be asked in the exams, right sir? It's a revolutionary idea, Bipin. Listen with an open mind. What do you have in mind, bro? Something beyond your imagination. Sir, I've given this a lot of thought. Students shouldn't suffer because I made a small mistake. I don't care if I don't get any salary, but these kids deserve to be educated. But what's the plan, bro? World War! Sir, I was going to cover World War this month. I didn't know I'd get suspended. But now, I'll turn this negative into a positive. I'll do something no one in Lucknow has ever done before. I'll spend my own money and go to Europe, and teach World War II to the students, live from World War II locations. Please don't stop me, sir. Why do you need to go to Europe, bro? The ambience. You think they'll believe you? I don't think he'll be going anywhere, sir. He's still lying. How mean of you to think that way! Here are my tickets, sir. Please have a look. Paris, Normandy, Amsterdam, Berlin, Auschwitz... 335,000, plus GST. Learn Something from him. Ajay sir is spending his own money and going abroad, just to educate his students. And you, you don't teach anything in school so that students pay extra for coaching from you. Don't you think you'll be spending a lot of dough on it, bro? I won't be spending a dime. Once I have the ambience set... I'll get Papa to foot the bill for it. Oh, there's so much I still have to learn from you, bro. Here. - Awesome. - I'll get you some tea. Bipin, my Bullet was purchased in 2019. It's in top condition. Try selling it for 150,000. Also, talk to Bhura Jewellers, and tell him I'll be selling one, no two chains, and two rings. No, not my wife's wedding necklace! Not my wife's wedding necklace! I don't want to pawn them, I want to sell them. I need money. Try to understand, bro. Bye. Why are you selling these things? I need money, Papa. What do you want to buy now? A new life. And what's wrong with this life? What's right with it, Papa? I could be neither a good son nor a good husband nor a good teacher. Ajju? Leave, I'll handle this. What do you have in mind? Tell me everything. I have a revolutionary idea, Papa. I see. Listen with an open mind. You have my full attention. - Come on. - I never took Nisha out on a holiday. I never taught my students well. I still need to cover the World War II portion. I'm suspended for a month. So? So, I'm thinking of taking Nisha to Europe with me and teaching my students about World War II, live from the location. It'll be a good education for my students and a good vacation for us. Those kids will learn a thing or two and our relationship will progress a little too. So, I am trying to arrange for the money, Papa. - How much...? - No, Papa. I cannot take money from you. - No. - Fine. 8 to-- 800,000 - 1,000,000. 800,000 - 1,000,000... Right. Hmm. Mummy, give me whatever you've made. I'll have it. But won't it be more expensive to take Nisha along? My old geezer won't pay if I won't take her along. Oh, like that. Like that. Can I say something, if you don't mind? Ajju is making... a fool of you. Possible. But if it helps improve Ajju and Nisha's relationship... Then it's a small price to pay. Right, we spent 500,000 on their wedding reception itself. Yes, Ma. Ajju has given me such a wonderful surprise. What places will you visit? Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Normandy and Auschwitz. Are you happy? Yes, Ma. I'm very happy. Wow, Nisha, your passport has many stamps on it. Look at Ajju's, it's a blank book. Purpose of visit? Our first honeymoon didn't go so well, so we decided to go for another one. - Listen... - Hmm? I too had saved some money. Convert them into Dollars. They use Euros, not Dollars. Then convert them into whatever works. I'm sending my son and his wife to Europe. Your tea. Hmm. Your Euros. Hey Nisha, listen... This is the first time I'm taking out Euros from here. Keep them. For your personal expense. Start following me on Facebook and Insta. I'll upload videos and you too will learn a thing or two. - Got it? - You know his ID, right? Ajjurocks_253 - Okay. - You see Bipin, I'm creating such an ambience that... That people will remember the ambience and not the result. Correct. Thank you. I'm so excited! No need to get too excited. I neither have any interest in the World War, nor in this trip, nor you. I'm only doing this for my image. Papa wouldn't have given me any money if I hadn't tagged you along. So, do me a favour and go straight to your house from the airport. Make any excuse you want. I'll call you back when I return. Sobs at a drop of the hat. 'I have some hope left.' 'The day that breaks, I'll come back.' 'But I won't come back quietly.' 'I'll come back only after teaching him a lesson.' I'm going. Don't create a scene this late in the night. I told you, you can go there from the airport. I'm going to Europe. I'm not taking you with me. Who are you to stop me? I'm not using your money to go there. I'm going to use my in-laws' money. - You mad or what? - Yes, I was mad to trust you. I've never come across anyone more unscrupulous or selfish than you. I stayed home because you didn't like me stepping out. I didn't take up a job. I didn't go out. I'm done living by your rules. Now I want to live for my happiness. If you have a problem then don't go, because I am going for sure. Give me a hand, bro. It'll help you build some muscles. It's too heavy. That's a lot of baggage for just 15 days. Now come on, she's not like you to spend a whole week wearing the same t-shirt and pants. She'll change thrice a day if she wants to. - Our Nisha is no less than a movie star. - That's true. Bro, your bike will stay parked for 15 days. Its engine might seize. If you want-- I mean... I could take it for a spin. Keep the hype alive. Don't worry, bro. I won't let the hype die. See you then. Bless you, my child. Have a safe journey. - Take care. - Best of happy journey. - Okay. - I too should get going. Okay. Go on, son. Take care. Tuck your stole in, dear. Bye, Nisha. Hail Goddess Narmada! Kalpesh Bro! - Yeah? - Pass me some Chakli. Chakli? Yo Headphone! Pass him these Chaklis. Thank you. Thank you. - Here. - Send Dhoklas too, son. Okay. Bro! Yo! Pass him the Dhokla. Pass him the Dhokla. Pass him the Dhokla. Thanks. And this packet of tangy snacks. Please. - Last, - Last. Should I also send some Thepla across? Yes, please. Pass this to him. It's hot. Please take it. - What the...! - Hey... he's just a kid. Let him be. He's a kid? He's a kid at heart. Let him be. Pass it to him. He'll enjoy it. Thanks. Gujarati Khakra... Yo buddy... Why are you doing this? Oi, bro... Please pass it on. - Khakra? - Khakra. Khakra. That was a special sattvic Khakra for Ba. She has been fasting since morning. - You just took a bite from them all. - Toll tax. Toll tax. What do I do about this now? He's taken a bite off all of them, Ba. Don't eat it. Walk with confidence and no one will stop you. Watch and learn. Officer, good morning! Step aside, please. - Who me? - Yes, you. Confidence, huh? Open your bag, please. Yes, yes. Yeah. I'm (a) teacher. It's gonna be 100% fun! He got caught. Not happening. Happens all the time. Idiot! Let's go. This is not our bag. Then whose is it? I don't know. Ba, we'll do the Garba under the Eiffel Tower. Don't say a word, or they'll confiscate the bag, and if they find contraband in it then they'll arrest you as well. If they arrest me then they'll arrest you too. I'll tell them I'm not with you. I'll show him our passports and prove that you're my wife. Okay, you can go. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Whose bag is it? Kalpesh Shah. Huh? Gujju gang! - Here's some chips. - Thank Snacks. And Dhokla! Yes Ma, we've reached, safe and sound. Yes, Ajay is fine. I'll call you later. Okay. Who wears such embroidered shirts? And who eats pomegranate seeds? Who brings ready-to-cook meals from India? Is he blind? He should've checked before he took the bag. Fine, I made a mistake, but he could have checked, right? But how would he, he was busy thinking about food! Ruined both my inflight experience and my trip. People like them go abroad and give India a bad name. And who uses Khus(Vetiver) perfume these days?! Bloody blackguard! The photos they put up on the website make it look like a 5-star spot, but what do we get - this lollipop! Come on, mood. MOOD! Hello, students! What you see behind me is not the telephone tower of Lucknow, it is The Eiffel Tower of Paris. Your dearest Ajju sir has reached the war front. Lessons on World War II begin tomorrow, live from Paris. After that, we go to Normandy, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Auschwitz. No stone will be left unturned to educate you. Educating Lucknow, Empowering Lucknow. Saw that? Tomorrow will be fun. Laugh away! You think this is funny, huh? I look like a zero here, and I'm sure that Ba's baby must be looking like a hero there. What kind of clothes does he wear?! They're so plain! They have no embroidery or design. They could've put a small emblem... A cheetah, a running deer, a crocodile, or something. We don't wear such clothes even when we're mourning. Where are you going? I've no interest in it, but this is Paris and not Lucknow. Here, on seeing a lonely girl in a deserted street thieves snatch her money, and steal her phone. I'm going to see the Eiffel Tower. You already saw it from the window. Are you going to see the whole of Paris only through the window? Unlike you, I'm not a tourist. I'm a teacher. I'm going to the World War Museum. Enjoy. Going to see the whole of Paris only through the window, she asks! Excusez-moi. Yes, sir? You have Fennel Seeds? You know small-small green-green? No? By the way, the food was terrible. Hey, remember these two things here. When you meet someone, say - Bonjour. It means hello. If someone helps you, say - Merci Beaucoup. It means thank you. Okay? Then you'll only use Bonjour, because you never say thank you to anyone. By the way, the bus for the Museum leaves from over there. Bonjour! Bonjour! 40 Euros. Only 40 Euros? 3360 Rupees! Trying to rob me or what? Thank you. Hello. Hello. Can I help you? 10 Euro... Hmm? So, my dear students, your Ajju sir spent 50 Euros from his own pocket, to give you a tour of the War Museum. See you soon. "Your "Tommy" days are done," "You'll now be called a hound," "You are in big trouble, dude." "You hide in lion's skin," "But how'll you hide your tail, huh has-been?" "You are in big trouble, dude." "Weapons activated." "Stop." "Watch." Check. No update. Looks like he got stuck somewhere. "I'm going crazy..." "I'm going crazy..." "I'm going crazy..." "I'm going crazy..." "You dined on lavish cuisine," "How will bare bones sustain your routine?" "You are in big trouble, dude." "You are in big trouble, dude." "Get your freak on." "I'm feeling so blue," "My future is overdue," "My options seem so few," "WHAT TO DO?" "I feel like I'm in a zoo," "All my plans are askew," "Bad luck chasing me too," "WHAT TO DO?" "I'm going crazy," Only underwear, monsieur? Go ahead and rob me blind. Yeah... you wretched. "I'm going crazy," - So... - Hmm? How was your day? Le Beautiful. Did some shopping, some sightseeing, and some eating... The day ended so I came back. Hmm, was your eating and sightseeing experience as good as your shopping experience? I cannot tell you how bad my day was. The taxi driver took 40 Euros for a 4km ride! That's enough money to go on a trip to Nainital, with family. They were charging Rs. 500 for a bun with a few leaves in it. What do we eat? And they're selling tickets to musicals in the name of the museum. How's that fair?! And what language do they speak, huh?! They sound like they have their mouths stuffed with powdered sugar. Zoo zoo wee voozuva vuzoowee. So sad. Will you go out with me tomorrow? You are better at this. No. It's a foreign country. Neither do I know the people, nor do I understand their ways. You are the only one I know here. Please. You know when a girl gets married and moves in with her husband, she is going to a completely new place. She doesn't know anyone there, she doesn't know their ways... The only person she can count on is her husband... And I could never do that. Anyway, I'm not like you. We'll go together, tomorrow. Merci beaucoup. How was your day? You saw how it was. These clothes are not that bad. Really? You've already seen it, haven't you? Then why did you bring me here? You want me with you, right? - Hmm. - Then don't question me. Nice view, but what connection does this have with World War II? Every nook and cranny of Europe hides a story of World War II. When Hitler attacked, the French left the city without a fight, so that this beautiful city is not ruined in the war. And this view that you are enjoying right now, Hitler didn't get to enjoy it even after capturing Paris. Why? Because the French cut the lift's cables before leaving. How do you know all this? There is nothing you cannot find out if you make an effort. That implies for both, places and humans. Dear Students, due to a technical snag, I couldn't teach you anything yesterday. But no one can stop me from teaching you today. In 1939, when Hitler attacked Poland, Great Britain and France declared war on Germany. And that's how World War II started. People used to dress better than this back then as well. Look, they're still sleeping in separate beds. When they get closer, their beds too will get closer. I wonder when. Wonderful! Great architecture! It deserves a full photo. Together, hmm? What say? Hello, gentleman. Bonjour. - Bonjour. - One full photo. Yeah yeah, of course... - Give me your phone. - Expensive. Yeah yeah, no problem. So... I count to three and you have to look at there and when I say three you turn, - and smile, okay? - Done. - He's saying we have to look there... - I understand. It's good. One... You didn't say two or three. You thief! Thief! He's a thief! That hippy! Catch him! Thief! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! Thief! Don't just stand there! Catch him! French people, he's fast, catch him! Thief! Thief! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! He's a thief! Catch him! Stop. Stop. Boo! Hey! Stop-stop-stop! This is Paris, not Lucknow. Got it? You don't have a problem going out with me now? What if I get a fit? I thought about it, a lot. Hmm. I concluded that no one knows me here. What difference will it make? If no one knows you here, then why do you keep cribbing about your clothes? Nisha, you remember the bangles I gave you to wear for the wedding? Have you taken those with you? No, it's in my cupboard. It's in the drawer. Fine, I'll take it from there. Okay, I'm hanging up now. Dear Students, as I taught you, there are stories of World War II hiding in every nook and cranny of Europe. And with this, we end our chapter on Paris. Now, we'll meet again in Normandy. Educating Lucknow, Empowering Lucknow. He's working hard, sir. He's leaving no stone unturned. But the same cannot be said about you. You plan to form a committee with these people? Yes, sir. This committee is very... I mean they are good people, sir. You keep this committee with you. Now I'll do what needs to be done. You think your Ajay sir is doing a good job, teaching kids over the mobile phone? We'll soon know what the kids have learnt. A real world war. A letter from a lawyer? It's a divorce notice. Divorce! You knew? How would I know? Divorce... Good Lord! You know what happened in Normandy? What happened in Normandy was a Fiasco! What? A Fiasco! And the real world war begins now. What will begin? We too are worried, Sister. We'll be losing a nice girl like Nisha. We don't know what to say. Our boy's at fault. It's not so, Sister. Sometimes, two people just don't get along. Well... Ajay is not that bad. Come on Sister, what's good about him? Good-for-nothing idiot. I don't know what happened. Nisha looked happy before she left. Brother, Ajju said he wanted to work on their relationship. That's why we sent them there, together. We didn't know that they were contemplating divorce! To be honest, I really don't know what to do. What else can we do? We should call them back, and ask whether they want to stay together or get separated. They need to decide and let us know. I cannot take this tension anymore. My blood sugar levels have already spiked. No, Brother. Don't call them. They are all alone, in a foreign country. They don't have an elder there to reason with them. What if they do something untoward? It'll only cause more trouble. She is right. They are anyway returning in a couple of days, right? We can talk to them after they return. That works as well. We'll wait. We'll accept the rest as God's will. The largest British Cemetery in Normandy. Thousands of war heroes lay buried here who gave their lives to defeat Hitler and bring peace to the world. You seriously wasted 5 Euros on this audio guide. Anyway, let me know what you learn. Many popped off, right? So, this is the beach where the soldiers gave up their lives. They've maintained it well. Only sand and water, no humans in sight. One second, I'll be right back. Excusez-moi... Bonjour! - Bonjour. - Shack? Beer? Where? Not here. No? Damn. Why are you crying? I should be the one crying. No shacks, no beer, no corncobs, no relaxing massages... And they call this a beach? I don't want to hear it. You know which channel's playing Badshah's song? I'm just kidding. She's too emotional. 6th June 1944, Omaha Beach, 6:30 a.m. The first contingent of Allied Forces landed, and 12,000 German soldiers were waiting for them. 300 metres of open beach. No place to hide. 96 percent of soldiers of the first contingent were martyred in the first hour itself. Come on. Go take over. Go. It was a certain death, but that didn't stop them. These brave soldiers from Omaha Beach set an example of bravery. No. It's not easy to embrace death for the freedom of others. Some were fighting the war for the first time, and some for the last time. Some had their family waiting at home, and some could never meet their family again. War has never benefited anyone. There is just one line about Normandy in the textbook. That more than 10,000 soldiers died in the battle of Normandy. Something one can easily miss while teaching. There were many 17-18 years old... That's not an age to die. Never seen "Ajju Bro" this emotional. Don't tell anyone. Why? It'll ruin your image? Tough men don't cry? Not in front of everyone. Dear Students, it's very easy to pass comments while watching the war on TV. But only the people who have either fought or seen one know the true consequences of war. The only way to pay true tribute to these heroes who gave their lives for their country is by always remembering their sacrifice, but not just because it'll be asked in the exams. Why is your image so important to you? I've never been good at anything. I've never been bad at anything either. I've always been average. People like me are like garnishes on top of a treat. Their presence doesn't really matter. But I didn't want to be a garnish. That's why I always maintained a good image. So that I don't look average when I sit with a topper like you. Wassup, Bipin! I've wrongfully been declared out, LBW, bro. The bloody umpire is in cahoots with them. Is this why you called? No bro, I just got carried away. I need you to take a deep breath now. Why? What happened? Things are going to take a turn for the worse. The legislator is about to kill the ambience you've been creating with your posts. What exactly is he going to do? It's not confirmed. But I know he's planning something big. Fine, let me know once you find out his plans. Don't worry, I'm on it. I also have a couple of boys with their ears on the ground. I'm hanging up now. I thought the ambiance I'll set will get the legislator to back off. But he is planning an invasion instead. I don't think this trip will benefit me anymore. It's better to go back. Come on, you must be doing something right... That's the reason the legislator has got his knickers in a twist. How will going back help anyway? He will anyway do what he wants to do. You should continue with what you are doing. You have started something, so don't leave it halfway. I could go back, but one should never leave anything halfway. He can continue to invade, I'll continue to educate. We should stay. Right. So many cows, oh boy! Enjoy, enjoy. AM-STER-DAM! Alpesh! Jignesh! I found my bag! Come fast! My bag! I found my bag! Gujju Gang! You bloody bag thief! You are a bloody bag thief! - I am a bag thief? - Yes. Hey, don't call my brother a bag thief! What else do I call him - The Khakra King? Hey-hey-hey... calm down. Whom does this bag belong to? You. So who is a bag thief? - And whose bag do you have? - Yours. So who is a bag thief now? - Hey! - Hey! HEY! You took his bag, right? Yes, I made a mistake. So, he too made a mistake. But I am the one who's at a loss here, Sister. Look at him, wearing my clothes and going around as Mr. Colourful. You know what I got in his bag - clothes people wear at home. I wouldn't even wear this to bed! - That's an expensive t-shirt. - This one?! - Yes. - Hang on a second. So give him his bag and take your bag back. But his bag is in Berlin. What is my bag doing in Berlin? Well... we sent our bags with our girls. You see we boys are here for a bachelor trip. There's an area here, you know... - where you cannot take your wives along. - Right. Why can't you take your wives there? You see Sister, they have big glass windows there, where girls stand wearing skimpy clothes. We can say hi-hello to them, like this. Tell me, won't I lose my reputation if I go there in such plain clothes? Please Brother, give me my bag back. Please. Our family group has been roasting him because of his clothes. - Yes. - Please Brother, try to understand. So you expect me to walk around naked here? Give me my bag and take your bag. Simple. - Let's go. - No, Brother! Please, Brother! Wait! Can I have a pair at least? Please? Oi Brother, give me fresh pair from the bag. You're giving me a fresh pair? Whatever... give it. What a madcap! Madcap? What did you say? Nothing, nothing. My undies! Those are my undies. I had no other option. I cannot shop for new undies here. Too expensive. And without the undies, it gets stuck in the zip, so... - Yeah, yeah. - Right? - You take capsules? - No. - You do, don't you? - No, I don't! - You do, you do. - Ohhh... Lovebirds! Fly free! Fly free! What do you mean by lovebirds, huh? Let him pee. He's calling us lovebirds! What does he mean, huh?! He doesn't understand. Give me my clothes. Just give me my clothes, man. Here are your clothes. - Take this as well. - Right. What are you doing, man? - It's taking so long. - Yes. "O' handsome brat," "O' dapper lad," "O' graceful chap," "Your friends are waiting for you!" "O' handsome brat," "O' dapper lad," "O' graceful chap," "Your friends are waiting for you!" Lift's not working. We'll have to take the stairs. - Which floor? - Top floor. You can carry this one. I'll carry those. No, I'll manage. Come on... Want me to help? No, I'm coming, I'm coming. Tired? Yes. No. They're light. Haven't hit the gym for a week. So... Thank you. Thank you. Can I get another glass of water? I carried two bags. I'm starving, but I don't have the strength to go outside. There are ready-to-eat meals in Kalpesh's bag. You wanna try? I don't mind, but how will we warm them up? Just tell me what would you like to eat. Lentils with rice or tasty kidney beans? Kidney beans with rice. In the washroom? Tastes good? I've been to the washroom after having kidney beans, several times. But this is the first time I'm having kidney beans coming from the washroom. Best kidney beans ever. The legislator has a tough field set. Ajju Bro will get caught out. Only those who don't have the guts to hit a six worry about field settings. Got it? Ajju Bro is a star... A shining star. Where is he, Papon? Amsterdam. You know where he's going next? You don't, right? Where's he going, Papon? To Anne Frank's house. To Anne Frank's house. You know Anne Frank... who he was? She. Right, she. Who she was? You don't know, right? So stick to frying snacks. Never learnt a thing... bloody illiterate. So, what does Anne Frank look like? I just asked out of curiosity. Anne Frank's house is so huge. Hey, will you please translate whatever the guide says in English? But you do understand English, don't you? Only Bipin's English. Hello, Ajju Bro. Good morning. Good night. Okay, bye. These people speak with a weird accent. Hello! How are you? Nice to meet you. That's all I can make out. This way, please. Fine, I'll translate. Anne was only 13 when she started writing her diary. Anne was only 13 when she started writing her diary. This was their hiding place. When the German soldiers were hunting and killing the Jews, Anne Frank and her family had to hide in this house. There was a warehouse downstairs, so they had to finish all their morning chores before it opened. They wouldn't make any noise after it opened to avoid getting caught. They didn't have much, but they were happy with what they had. She was of your age. She wanted to be a writer. That's why she kept writing her diary even in such difficult circumstances, because she knew, any day could be the last day of her life. Anne Frank didn't survive the war, but through her diary, she's still alive in the hearts of millions of people. On the other hand, we have no such sword hanging over our heads, yet we are not happy, because we've forgotten how to live. If today were to be the last day of your life... What would you do? Philosophical much? A visit to Anne Frank's house is bound to make one philosophical. Tell me, what would you do? I'd wear a gown similar to that one, go to a place like that one, and have a beer like that one. I should've taken to Anne Frank's place sooner. Let's go. "Deceitfully, she..." Oh, the ambience... If you go dressed like that... I cannot go dress like this! Stop staring, baldie... she's taken. She's taken. She's mine. Sit. I'll go get it. So many? They have a happy hour running. Two minutes of delay and I would've had to pay double. Oh. You'll drink two, right? I don't know. Let's see. Anyway, you get started and I'll see it through. You are smart. You saved us some money. I'm not smart, I'm resourceful. You are the smart one. - I see. - You can fight off thieves, settle disagreements, cook in the washroom, and understand accents. I didn't know you were this smart. Honestly. Come on, let's know each other a little better. It's my first time drinking. I knew it. The way you made a face after you had the first sip... I just knew it. It's my first time drinking with a girl. - For real? - I'd asked a couple, but they refused outright. Insult. No one ever asked me. Fine, I'll ask. Favourite film. Scent Of A Woman, Life Is Beautiful, Good Will Hunting. Good! Come on! And yours? Jurassic Park, Spiderman, and Titanic... It sank after it hit a... I want to know Ajay's favourite films, not Ajju's. Hero No. 1, Jodi No. 1, and Aunty No. 1. Govinda fan! Always. You? Farukh Shaikh, Amol Palekar... and Smita Patil. Whoa! Two more, please. Favourite singer? Kishore Kumar, Arijit Singh... Shreya Ghoshal. Altaf Raza, Shabbir Kumar, Mohammad Aziz... no Devang Patel. Devang Patel? "I do what I please!" Tolstoy, Shakespeare, Rabindranath Tagore. Super Commando Dhruv, Chacha Chaudhary, Billu Aur Pinky. Fried bread with spicy fillings. Flat rice with sweet pretzels. Lentil, rice with okra. Mix veggies with garlic naan. Trust me, it's a dish. Bawli Handi?! Honest to God... Bawli Handi! Bawli Bundi... Handi? Thank you, kind sir. Thank you. T-shirt and jeans. Long skirt with a crop top. Virat Kohli. Rahul Dravid. Ferrari. Scooty. Cumin seeds digestive. Phantom cigarette. Winter. Monsoon. Beach. Mountain. We have nothing in common. Does it matter? "My eyes brimmed with tears," "You've left me in awe," "In my lonely heart, you've started to dwell." "My eyes brimmed with tears," "You've left me in awe," "In my lonely heart, you've started to dwell." "You merged incomplete paths," "You've given incomplete winds a new start," "You made incomplete conversations last," "Thus formed a love bound so sublime," "It binds your heart to mine," "It binds your heart to mine," "It binds your heart to mine," "It binds your heart to mine," "I used to feel nothing at all," "I used to not rest or ever stall," "I just existed," "Love made me thrive," "Love made me feel alive," "It binds your heart to mine," "It binds your heart to mine," "You're the answer to my prayer," "My days always start and end with you so fair," "Even if I'm unworthy," "My heart will always love you without any mercy." "You merged incomplete nights of the past ," "You've graced incomplete days that went by too fast," "You made incomplete conversations last," "Thus formed a love bound so sublime," "It binds your heart to mine," "It binds your heart to mine," "I used to feel nothing at all," "I used to not rest or ever stall," "I just existed," "Love made me thrive," "Love made me feel alive," "I lost my heart to you," "My world with you is pure and true," "It binds your heart to mine," "It binds your heart to mine," We finally made it to Hitler's city, Berlin. This is where all the hoo-hah started. These peoples are troublemakers. Don't blame the whole city for the actions of one guy. Why? Isn't this where World War II began? This is where it ended as well. But you'll have to agree, Hitler was a bad guy. He has such a beautiful country of his own, yet he had his eyes set on the neighbouring country. It's because of his greed that half the world suffered a huge loss, and he lost his life. We all too are a little like Hitler, aren't we? We aren't satisfied with what we have. We want what others have. If we have a cycle, we want a bike. If we have a bike, we want a car. If we have a car, we want another car. This greed never ends. The World War is over, but... no one knows when the war we fight within will end. - Excuse me? - Yeah? Can you tell me where this museum is? Oh, you just need to cross the street, - and then there is a bus station there... - One second. One minute. Okay. Yes Bipin, tell me. You went there to end a fiasco, not to create a new one every day! Just tell me what happened! The video where Nisha and you are drunk and dancing... It has caused havoc. It has gone viral. Every kid in Lucknow has already watched it. I personally snatched the mobile phones from a couple of them and deleted it. The legislator is already on the wait with a match in his hand, and you just handed him more fuel. Hello? Hello? Nisha! Let's go. Did you upload that video? - Which video? - The one where we are dancing? - Yes, why? - ARE YOU CRAZY-- Have you lost your mind? I've been working so hard here, but now everyone thinks that I'm just having a good time. It was our first video together. You think we are here on a honeymoon? I am here to clear my image, and you've ruined everything now. Ajay, it was the first time I had some fun with you. I wanted to share it with everyone. I wanted to tell everyone that I too live a normal life. Sorry, it caused you so much trouble. I'll delete it. Deleting the video won't give me my image back. You are so selfish! You see nothing beyond your image! Yes, I am selfish! - And I am happy the way I am! - You are not happy! You always keep looking for excuses to sulk. You went high and low to keep your image, didn't you? Did you find any happiness? It's because I never got what I wanted from life! And I got you for a life partner... A defected piece! Ajay... I didn't mean that. You're impossible. Nisha, wait... You know I already had the divorce papers ready? You asked for divorce papers? I would've signed them too, but I had this hope that things would get better between us. A hope that you'd change. A hope that we'd live like a normal husband and wife. But I was wrong. I'll sign the papers as soon as I return and get out of your life. One important thing that we learn from Hitler's life is that an image created with the help of lies and propaganda doesn't last for long. That's why, we see a car park and not a memorial where Hitler died. Makes sense, doesn't it? In the end, people only remember the truth and not the lie fed to them. Yes Kalpesh, tell me. Ajju Bro! Don't you want your bag back? Sorry, but I spilled garlic chutney on two of your t-shirts. Where do you want to meet? I'm going back to India, tomorrow. This greed never ends. The World War is over, but no one knows when the war we fight within will end. We got it back! We got it back! Ajju Bro, you didn't steal anything from the bag, did you? - No. - You don't seem yourself today, Ajju Bro. Why do you look so sad? He is bound to be. I too would've been sad to lose such colourful clothes. Come on, let's go visit the museum, Ajju Bro. Ajju Bro... just imagine mixing up your bag with this bag. What would you wear? The teddy bear?! For us it's just a teddy bear, for her, it represented her entire childhood. We were fighting over stupid things in our bags. Nazi soldiers gave them just half an hour to fit their whole life in this small bag, and then sent them to die. This small bag? It won't even fit enough snacks to last a couple of days. To fit your whole life in it is... Impossible. Ajju Bro, if it were you... what would have you packed? Fast! Faster! Fast! Fast! Fast! Please one minute, please. Faster! No! - No... NO! - One... one photo, please. One second sir, please. Sir, one minute sir. One minute. STOP! Faster! Ma'am, your bags. Thank you. For 10 months, I kept thinking that you were not good enough for me. But in the last 10 days, I've realised that I'm not good enough for you. I always treated you badly. But you always did what was right. Yesterday, I lashed out at you in anger. I didn't mean to say it. It just slipped out of my tongue. Sorry. Ajay, the problem is not that it slipped out of your tongue, the problem is that it'll never slip out of your heart. I have epilepsy. That's my reality. But I cannot stop living my life fearing it. And I don't want you to live fearing it either. So, it's better if we part ways. You can leave, I won't stop you. But the only good thing in our relationship has been this trip. We just have 3 days left. Don't leave it halfway. Please. Listen... Ajju's calling. Answer it. No way, I'm scared. What if he goofed up again? You are a limit. - You talk to him. - Give it here. - Hello? - Hello? - Look, the phone is... - Hello? - Papa? - You've messed up the phone. - Hello, Papa? - Put it on speaker. Hello? Hello, son... What's wrong? Nothing. You ran out of money? No, no. You got arrested? NO! Then did someone steal your bags? Will you stop it?! Son... Nisha's with you, right? Yes, she's with me. Hail Goddess Narmada! Why do you both sound so tense? No, it's just that you are in a foreign country, all alone, but together... We're just worried. Where have you reached? And when are you coming back... the two of you? We've reached Krakow. We'll leave for Auschwitz next. And then for Lucknow, after 3 days. Here, talk to her. Papa... Welcome. - Hello. - Hello. Hello... my wife. - Hi, my name is Maroosh. - Hello. - Lovely House. - Thank you very much. So Maroosh, you know long journey, so... How far Auschwitz? Dear Students, this is the most dreadful and darkest chapter in the history of World War II. The world's largest and most dangerous concentration camp... Auschwitz. More than 1.3 million people were kept captive here, out of which 250,000 were children. They were kept in small rooms, crammed like animals. They were fed just enough to keep them alive, and were given only half a litre of water to drink every day. Refusing to do something was punishable by death. The inability to do something was punishable by death. Even the smallest mistake was punishable by death. Out of these 1.3 million people, 1.1 million were killed. The sorrows we face over a lifetime are nothing in comparison to the pain they suffered each day. And we spend our whole life crying over little things like... This didn't happen, that didn't happen. How was your trip today? Very disturbing. Oh... You went to the gas chamber? No, we could not go today. Tomorrow, we'll go to the gas chamber. It's even more disturbing. How is the food? Uhmm, great. You cook really good. Lucky man. Cooking, singing, dancing, studying, fighting... All very good. Funny man... and lucky girl. Okay guys, enjoy, have fun. I have to go to an event. What event? A guy who survived Auschwitz is here... sharing his story. Auschwitz's survivor is here... - is that what he said?! - Yes! Are you interested? - Yes! - Yes! - You wanna come? - Yes! Yes, please! Ladies and Gentlemen... Alex Grasenfiled. Thank you. I got married at a very early age. I got married at a very early age. I guess I was a decent husband, pretty much like how the majority of us are. I guess I was a decent husband, pretty much like how the majority of us are. I never shouted at her. I never hit her. I never shouted at her. I never hit her. I never cheated on her. But I also never took her out. But I also never took her out. Never brought her flowers, Never brought her flowers, never said thank you. never said thank you. And then, one day we were brought here... to Auschwitz. And then, one day we were brought here... to Auschwitz. We were separated. Nothing was as it used to be. And you know what I missed the most? I missed waking up next to her. I missed my wife the most. I missed waking up next to her, her perfume, her food... I even missed our small tiffs. We got just one hour together. We got just one hour together every day, but that one hour was enough, to motivate me to survive the next 23 hours, so that I can meet her again the next day. And one day... I didn't see her. Then one day, I didn't see her, and I knew I'd never see her again. Every relationship goes through their Auschwitz. Every relationship goes through their Auschwitz. Only then do we learn its significance. I took too long to understand that... It was too late by the time I learnt its significance. I hope and pray that yours doesn't end like mine. I hope and pray that yours doesn't end like mine. Dear Students, thousands of people were brought to this gas chamber every day, who knew that something bad was going to happen to them. What's going on? No clue. But no one knew what was going to happen. So kids, how are your History lessons going? Your Ajju sir has made quite a few videos for you. They are going well, sir. We are enjoying it. Good. Very good. Then how about a surprise test? Hmm, Principal? Mr. Pandey? Yes, sir. Prisoners were brought here under the pretext of taking a shower. Once they'd come here after taking off their clothes... they would be killed using pesticides. Nisha! Nisha! Nisha! Nisha! Ajay! Nisha! Nisha! Ajay! Nisha! Nisha! Nisha! Nisha! Nisha! Nisha! Nisha! Nisha! Nisha! Nisha! Nisha! Step aside! Move, move! Nisha! Nisha... Nisha! Nisha... Easy, easy... Please, water, water...? Nisha...? You'll be fine. You'll be fine. Nisha... it's okay. My wife. She's fine. Ice pack... you'll feel better. Feeling better? Nisha... have some water. "I'd surrender my heart to you," Let it be. I'll do it. - Let me do it. - "I'd surrender my life to you," Take your pill, Nisha. "If you'd let me love you," "For eternity I'll love you," Today I cook, and you eat. - "If you'd let me love you," - Lucky you. - God save me. "For eternity I'll love you," Thank you. Welcome. Have a nice trip. Let's go? "Every season," "I'd change to spring for you," "If you'd let me love you," Together. "For eternity I'll love you," "If you'd let me love you," Excuse me, could you pass these Samosas to him, please? "For eternity I'll love you," Excuse me... he sent these for you. "For eternity I'll love you," "On your beautiful eyes," "I'd often recite poems too," Let's go. "On your beautiful eyes," "I'd often recite poems too," Where to? "Every day, I'd tell you I only belong to you," "Every day, I'd tell you..." - "Countless times, - Nishadganj! - "I'd praise you," - You're going home? - "If you'd let me love you," - Why? You aren't? - Let's get going bro, before she changes her mind. - "For eternity I'll love you," "For eternity I'll love you," So Ajju... - you're back, huh? - Yes, Papa. Don't worry, everything will be fine. You have me. And... and Nisha too. Yes. Sarita! Yes? Both of them are here! Hail Goddess Narmada! My child... Mummy. God bless you. You two have lost so much weight in just 15 days! Then feed us. I've made eggplants. You don't like them. I'll have anything you feed me. Nisha... Who is he? It's me! Eggplants! Smart, yeah? Amazing. Mummy, this too is for you. Wow! Papa, the money we managed to save. Oh. This is the first time I'm getting any money back. Thinking about the job? Yes, but yours, not mine. I'll accept what fate has in store for me, and I'll never stop you from working again. I'd like to say something before you do. I know what you think about me. You think I'm not a good teacher. You're correct. Actually, I'm a very bad teacher. I never taught my students well, because I never had any interest in teaching them. I was a fake, sir. My claims, my clothes, my status... All fake. I gave good grades to my students and ensured none of them failed so that my image stays intact. But sir, in the last 15 days, I taught my students to the best of my ability. But these 15 days cannot expunge my past sins. These kids deserve better. My resignation, sir. I apologise for what happened. Gagan Mathur, 38 out of 50. Shobhit Upadhyay, 41 out of 50.

History exists so that we learn from our mistakes, and correct them. I did not want a bad teacher in this school. But I also do not want a good teacher to leave the school.

If you stay sad thinking about what others have... You will never be happy. If you'll find happiness in what you've got, then there'll be no better image than the genuine smile on your face. And nothing else.
