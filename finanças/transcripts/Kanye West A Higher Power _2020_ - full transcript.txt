- I remember playing demos for all these different labels in here, bring different people in. And everybody wanted the sound to sound like something that was already out there. And to me that was blocking, that was a form of blocking your artistic freedom. Not allowing you to just express what you wanted to do and bring some type of change to the game. A man with a musical gift, whose words spread controversy wherever he goes. Kanye West became the most important new rap star of the 2000s. A character who made the mainstream come to him rather than the other way around. Proud winner of 21 Grammy Awards, his ego is almost justified. Kanye is one of the most recognizable rappers of the 21st century,transforming the sound of music through his production style and passionate lyrics. - Kanye West is the super producer turned rapper to reality star who's never at the headlines and made some of the best rap hip-hop music of the last two decades. - Any opportunity I get to express my music, I try to take it. However, controversial statements will be a constant factor in his career, affecting his life and causing uproar around the pop culture world. On top of that, Kanye's marriage to Kim Kardashian added another layer to the stars overwhelming fame. The constant hounding of the press would affect Kanye's mental state later in his career. But despite his outspoken behavior, Kanye West has changed the world with his sound and image, developing a new Sunday service church in 2019 and releasing a gospel album. - Only thing bad about performing was that, while I was performing, I couldn't actually see it. It seems Kanye is turning his favor to religion and staying out of the public disputes. The past decade of his career has been turbulent. But he maintains his status as one of the greatest rappers of his generation. - Around the time of the European Awards, I think my public perception was at an all time low, they made me look like I was just an animal for running on stage and basically saying, "This is how I feel," I felt like I was robbed at the awards and everything. And you know, a lot of people would say negative things about me, a lot of magazines pulled out on me, a lot of people turned their backs on me and inspired me to of into the studio and make music that people couldn't deny,inspire the course for stronger. That that don't kill me, it only make me stronger. - Kanye West was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and he moved to Chicago when he was three years old. His parents got divorced so he was raised solely by his mom. And they had a great relationship, they're really, really close. She was a teacher. He was very much brought up in a very middle class background. He had a good schooling. He went to university to study art, but dropped out after one year because he really wanted to focus on his music. Kanye West's ambition in life was always to become a professional rapper. By the year 2000, Kanye was making a name for himself in the music production scene. This would solidify the beginning of his career. - In the beginning, Kanye was working with lots of unknown artists, lots of underground stars, but it was his collaboration with Jay-Z on his "Blueprint" album that really got Kanye noticed. After his persistent attempts to get a contract, co-founder of Roc-A-Fella records, Damon Dash, reluctantly signed him to keep him from defecting to another label. - It actually took Kanye quite a while to persuade the other guys he was working with that he should be taken seriously as a rap star. You know, he didn't have the kind of gangster rap pedigree that these other guys had. At the time, it was like you needed to be, a drug dealer or have been shot in order to be taken seriously as having any credibility. Kanye was this guy who'd grown up in a beautiful suburb of Chicago. His mother was a very respected academic. He'd lived in China when he was 10 years old and learned Chinese. He certainly didn't have that kind of pedigree. Ironically, it was a tragedy that gave Kanye his first break as a solo artist. On the 23rd of October, 2002, Kanye's life was to change dramatically. He had been working late at a California recording studio, when he eventually decided to drive home. Kanye fell asleep at the wheel causing a near fatal car crash. The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which was wired shut during reconstructive surgery. - He was involved in a really serious car crash, which involved him breaking his jaw in three places. The jaw was then wired back together, and it really provoked him in thinking life is for living, let me live it. - He talked about that he'd been kind of saved because he's a religious man. And I think he had this sense, this could have confirmed that, that he had this sense of purpose, and that's why he'd been saved. And people who worked with him said that from then on, it was like a different character, he was even more fired up, he was even more purposeful. Kanye used his life changing crash to his advantage. If anything, it encouraged him to fulfill his ambition of becoming a rapper. While suffering with his jaw wired shut, he recorded his first single, "Through the Wire". - "Through the Wire" was kind of a surprise big hit. But in the background story behind it, it's actually pretty incredible the fact he had a life threatening car crash and wrote and performed the song with his jaw wired shut hence the name of the track, just weeks after he'd had his jaw wired. I think fans really pick up on on the pain and the truth behind that track, rather than just a gangster throwaway track that a lot of other rappers were putting out at the time. - There were so many different Polaroid pictures that you see which take him through his life through his journey. And it shows that he's obviously really thought about where he's come from, and probably where he's going. ♪ For breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert ♪ ♪ Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp ♪ ♪ That right there could drive a sane man bizerk ♪ ♪ Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzork ♪ ♪ How do you console my mom or give her light support ♪ ♪ Telling her, her sons' on life support ♪ ♪ And just imagine how my girl feel ♪ ♪ On the plane scared as hell that her guy... ♪ - This was this kind of formative event. And he emerges from sort of almost dying. And as a sort of rap star and it worked. It's sort of a self fulfilling prophecy. He tells the story of who he's going to become and he becomes that. - You know it happened for a reason. God knew I had a message, He knew I had a mission, but He knew no one cared about me. He said, "Kanye, I'm gonna make somebody care about you." Bam, I nearly died. That's one of the best things that can happen to a rapper. Kanye's first album, titled "The College Dropout" was recorded in Los Angeles while he was recovering from the accident. Unfortunately, the album was leaked months before its official release. Kanye, however, used this to his advantage, reviewing the album and making changes where he seemed fit. It was then pushed back from its 2003 release date and officially released the album with Roc-A-Fella Records in February 2004. "The College Dropout" went on to become a certified triple platinum album in the U.S. This accumulated Kanye 10 Grammy nominations, leading to three wins, including Best Rap Song for the track "Jesus Walks". - I changed my name this week from Kanye to The Face, which stands for the face of the Grammys. Due to the fact that 10 nominations is the third most in history, and from now on, I prefer to be called The Face. It was safe to say that Kanye West had established himself as a chart-topping rapper. He was eager to show that off at the Grammy's after party. - Somebody call hip-hop and tell him that his artist won three Grammys tonight. Let him know. I wanna thank my man Zekaya for co-writing for helping me come up with my speech. I wanna thank Brooke for helping me come up with my speech. I don't think I'll be on the internet like we should take these Grammys away here write this speech on the shelf. I love y'all and y'all know I love the rap, right?

With the money gained from the sales of "The College Dropout", Kanye was able to bring a whole live orchestra into the recording session for his second album, "Late Registration". A bold move that would change the overall sound of his music. - You've got collaborations with people like Jamie Foxx, Adam Levine. You're seeing here that Kanye is respected within the industry because he's got these great names on board. But it also shows that he's developing as an artist with his skill at producing rap as well as melody. "Late Registration"sold over 2.3 million units in the United States alone, and also broke a record for the most digital downloads in a week. When the single "Gold Digger" sold over 80,000 copies. - "Gold Digger" was one of the most successful songs ever and certainly one of the biggest hits of Kanye West's career. I think for mainstream people, people who, like myself, who weren't really rap fans, everybody likes that song. How can you not like that song? It doesn't matter if you're into rap music or not. It's a fantastically catchy crossover tune. And the fact that he got Jamie Foxx to duet with him on it was just perfect timing. It's a fun video, you see Kanye West looking extremely cool. ♪ Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger ♪ ♪ But she ain't messin' wit no broke, broke ♪ ♪ Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger ♪ ♪ But she ain't messin' wit no broke, broke ♪ ♪ Get down girl, go 'head get down ♪ ♪ Get down girl, go 'head get down ♪ ♪ Get down girl, go 'head get down ♪ ♪ Get down girl, go 'head ♪ Cutie da bomb ♪ Met her at a beauty salon ♪ ♪ With a baby Louis Vuitton ♪ Under her under arm - It was a great song, it was widely received across all genres, and it really put Kanye West on the map. "Late Registration" also won Kanye another Grammy for Best Rap Album. ♪ But she ain't messin' with no broke, broke ♪ ♪ Get down girl, go 'head get down ♪ ♪ Get down girl, go 'head get down ♪ - Now when I say get down, that means for y'all to get up actually, it's reverse psychology. ♪ Get down girl, go 'head get down ♪ ♪ Cutie da bomb ♪ Met her at a beauty salon ♪ ♪ With a baby Louis Vuitton ♪ Under her under arm ♪ She said I can tell you rock ♪ I can tell by ya charm ♪ Girls you got a flock ♪ I can tell by ya charm and ya arm ♪ ♪ I'm lookin' for the one ♪ Have you seen her? Kanye's image in 2005 however, changed dramatically. Just days after "Late Registration" release, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina victims on live television, Kanye exposed his controversial views. His comments reached much of the United States, leading to mixed reactions. George Bush will later call it, one of the most disgusting moments of his presidency. - In 2006, Kanye did one of the most shocking things that he's ever done. It was during a Hurricane Katrina telethon where celebrities went on TV to try and raise money for victims of the terrible events in New Orleans. And Kanye West is standing there next to Mike Myers and they are reading a teleprompter talking about the devastation that happened. And all of a sudden Kanye goes way off script. It's absolutely hilarious to watch Mike Myers' face because he literally looks like he's gonna die. He's so uncomfortable, he's completely stuck like a deer in the headlights. He doesn't know what to do and Kanye is just going for it and just ranting. - I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family, it says they're looting, if you see a white family, it says they're looking for food. And you know, it's been five days because most of the people are black. And even for me to complain about, I will be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the TV because it's too hard to watch. - Kanye is just ranting way and then finally at the end, he says that George Bush doesn't like black people. - It may end up being the most tragic loss of all. - George Bush doesn't care about black people. Please call. - In the past few days, America and people has been stepping up. - The producers quickly, quickly cut to somebody else to get Kanye off camera as fast as possible but because the show went out live, there was no way to edit any of that from appearing. It caused an international sensation. It was the biggest headline to come out of the entire thing that Kanye West went on TV and basically called George Bush a racist. - It proceeded to have a devastating effect really on Kanye and his reputation. Throughout 2005 and 2006, Kanye had been in the studio working on his third album. He wanted to change the sound of his music again, and after listening to songwriters, Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash, Kanye wanted to develop his wordplay and storytelling ability. Kanye third studio album, "Graduation" gamored major publicity when its release date pitted him in the sales competition against rapper 50 Cent. Upon the September 2007 release, "Graduation" outsold 50 Cent's,Curtis, by a large margin. Debuting at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and selling almost 1 million copies in its first week. - I'm just very like internationally charged, you know, it's fueled by all the places we visited, Australia, New Zealand, touring with the Rolling Stones, touring with U2 and Bono was like, nobody in the community's ever figured this out except from Michael Jackson. And that's making these stadium songs, these songs that connect with people's, their hearts, their minds and spirits, 10 years down the line. When you look at "Through the Wire", it gets just as big and that better response than "Gold Digger". So this album right here is the stadium status. Like I said on Big Brother, it's just stadium status. Kanye's life took a different direction when his mother, Donda West died of complications from cosmetic surgery involving breast reduction in November 2007. - I think the great rupture in Kanye's life is the death of his mother. He'd found success, he was on a certain path and she died relatively young. He felt guilty because if he hadn't moved to LA and she hadn't moved there with him that she'd still be alive. Which of course, that's not a rational response. - His first show after her funeral was actually here in England, at the O2. And he included a tribute to her in his set. And he continued to attribute, I believe he performed Journey's "Don't Stop Believin'", and he played that on every single date of the tour. So it shows you how much he wanted to celebrate her at his gigs. Months later, West and fiance, Alexis Phifer ended their engagement and long term intermittent relationship, which had begun in 2002. These events profoundly affected Kanye, who set off for his 2008, Glow in the Dark tour shortly thereafter. Feeling his emotions could not be conveyed through rapping, Kanye discovered the voice audio processor autotune to use while singing. This would go on to become akey feature in his next record. Recorded mostly in Hawaii, in three weeks, Kanye announced his fourth album, "808s & Heartbreak". At the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, where he performed its lead single, "Love Lockdown". Music audiences were taken aback by the uncharacteristic production style and the presence of autotune. - "Love Lockdown" is a really beautiful video and you know Kanye West is a big fan of black and white. And I think in this video, you can really see that, he has this all white room that he's in and it's almost like he’s having this dream like sequence. ♪ ya love lockdown, ya love lockdown ♪ ♪ Now keep ya love lockdown, you lose ♪ ♪ I'm not loving you, way I wanted to ♪ ♪ I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true ♪ ♪ I got something to lose, so I gotta move ♪ It's a beautiful video. It's very unusual, it's very attention getting and like Kanye himself, it's completely unpredictable. "808s & Heartbreak"contains themes of love, loneliness, and heartache and was released in November 2008. The record's singles demonstrated outstanding charts performances. - The 808 album was definitely quite a sad record to be honest. Even for the artwork with the heart ripped down the middle. So I think his personal life could have affected that release. I think with the use of the synths and the auto tune, it was as much as him experimenting and innovating with his sound. Across all his albums, he's never stayed the same. He's always kind of mixed up and tried to do something new with the production or the vocals. So I think this was just an extension of that. Upon its release, the lead single "Lockdown" debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. While the follow up single "Heartless" performed similar and debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. While it was criticized prior to its release, "808s & Heartbreak" had a significant effect on hip-hop music, encouraging other rappers to take more creative risk with their productions. Kanye's controversial incident, the following year, at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was arguably his biggest controversy to date and led to widespread outrage throughout the music industry. - Kanye West really outdid himself in the unpredictability department or let's say the loose cannon department. When Taylor Swift won at the VMAs and he stormed the stage saying that Beyonce should have won for Best Video, it was shocking. It had never really been done before, not in this high of a profile scenario. - Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you. Imma let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time. One of the best videos of all time. - He thought he was doing the right thing and sort of standing up for art and standing up for Beyonce's art. But to viewers, it just seemed like he was this guy interrupting somebody, who at that time, was a very young woman. And it wasn't just a sort of breach of protocol, it seemed aggressive and there was an enormous backlash. - Taylor Swift at this point, and still is, the nation's sweetheart. She's got the nation wrapped around her finger. This is like the worst thing you can ever do on live television. Because of his outburst at the VMAs, Kanye had lost a lot of respect from the press, critics and the music world. The incident caused Kanye to disappear from the public eye. "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy", Kanye's fifth studio album was released in November 2010 to rave reviews from critics. Many of whom described it as his best work that solidified his comeback. "Dark Fantasy" adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included, the international hit "All of the Lights" and billboard hits "Power", "Monster" and "Runaway". - "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" was dubbed Kanye's greatest work of all time. And truthfully it needed to be, he needed to get the public back into his arms. - This was a lot warmer, a lot brighter, bolder. It was kind of returning to the sound, that we know him and kind of fell in love with him for but he also had those big commercial songs like "All of the Lights" and "Power" that really resonated with fans and I think that was a welcome returned to form for him after the 808 album. - Following a headlining set at Coachella 2011, that was described by The Hollywood Reporter as one of the greatest hip-hop sets of all time, Kanye released the collaborative album, "Watch the Throne" with Jay-Z. - Kanye teams back up with Jay-Z for the "Watch the Throne" album and then subsequently the tour. Can this get any better? You've got hip-hop royalty together for an album, they're on tour, they're touring the world. I think literally every hip-hop fan was just going nuts for this. - Jay-Z and Kanye they have different flows and stylings but I think they worked really well together. They knew when to take the backseat and when to step forward. And they just combined very effectively to make one of the best rap albums of the last decade. By employing a sales strategy that released the album, digitally, weeks before its physical counterpart, "Watch the Throne" became one of the few major label albums in the internet age to avoid a leak. "In Paris" became the records highest charting single peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. - I think the reason "In Paris" was so big was it had massive buildup in terms of the music leading to that really heavy baseline. Then once that came in, it really stole the show. So you had these two great rappers, but it was really the base and the production and the beat behind it that got people moving around. It was such a big hit. ♪ Ball so hard, I'm shocked too, ♪ ♪ I'm supposed to be locked up too ♪ ♪ You escaped what I've escaped ♪ ♪ You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too ♪ ♪ Ball so hard, let's get faded, ♪ ♪ Le Meurice for like six days ♪ Gold bottles, scold models, spillin' Ace on my sick J's ♪ ♪ Ball so hard bitch behave, just might let you meet 'Ye ♪ ♪ Chi town's D. Rose, I'm movin' the Nets ♪ After touring the world with Jay-Z on the "Watch the Throne" tour, West began dating reality star and longtime friend Kim Kardashian in April 2012. It was the beginning of a Hollywood romance that would take the showbiz world by storm. - Kanye and Kim, the longest running love story in showbiz. It was nine years of to-ing and fro-ing before they finally got it together. And she'd been through two marriages by that point anyway. - I think at first when Kim and Kanye started going out, there might be a little bit of skepticism around it, like, is this a showmance? Kind of how serious is it because a reality star with a huge rap star that has this integrity and is really focused on his image and wants to protect that. I think it soon became apparent that they were serious about each other. The biggest reality star, teaming up with the biggest hip-hop star. Together, they became a force, a united showbiz force and it's continued to this day. - According to Kanye West, he has just been in love with Kim Kardashian for so long and I think it's terms of Kim's perspective, I think she never took Kanye seriously as a romantic interest until she was really at rock bottom picking up the pieces of her personal professional image following her disastrous marriage to Kris Humphries. And I think Kanye showed himself to be a true friend. And I think in that moment, she finally started to take him seriously as a romantic love interest and the rest is history. Kanye's sixth studio album, "Yeezus" was released in June 2013 to highly positive reviews from critics. Kanye touched upon controversial and sensitive topics and delivered a bold record, described as his most confrontational and bravest album to date. Despite leaking four days early upon its release, "Yeezus" sold almost 327,000 copies during it's first week and the album's lead single, "Black Skinhead" was certified gold by mid October. - With "Watch the Throne" you had like we're kings kind of thing. And then with "Yeezus" the title again alludes to Jesus which is a quite bold, arrogant statement but Kanye doesn't really care. He wants people to know he's the man, he's confident in what he's doing, he's an innovator. And while it did top the charts, but it was actually his lowest selling record on release even though critically, a lot of people said, it was his best since "The College Dropout". So it was interesting, but I think it was more down with the music industry in general rather than the quality of the the album. - He's always been religious but in quite an idiosyncratic way and certainly an irreverent way, calling an album, "Yeezus", calling a song, "I am a God". There's a lot of humor in hip-hop and I think sometimes people miss his humor and assume that he's just sort of demented. And a lot of the time he's sort of playing around with being sacrilegious and with taking symbols of the church or symbols of the civil rights movement and kind of treating them in quite a profane way. And that's part of the game of hip-hop. - I think "Black Skinhead" the lead single from the album is a very powerful choice. One, you had that driving, real driving beat in there with quite an aggressive delivery from Kanye. But with this whole "Black Skinhead", you also have the race elements in there that he wasn't shying away from delivering that and he was saying, "This is me like it or hate it." ♪ Came to see me in my black skin ♪ ♪ Number one question they asking ♪ ♪ Fuck every question you asking ♪ ♪ If I don't get ran out by Catholics ♪ ♪ Here come some conservative Baptists ♪ ♪ Claiming I'm overreacting ♪ Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch ♪ ♪ Four in the morning, and I'm zoning ♪ ♪ They say I'm possessed, it's an omen ♪ ♪ I keep it 300, like the Romans ♪ ♪ 300 bitches, where's the Trojans? ♪ ♪ Baby we living in the moment ♪ I've been a menace for the longest ♪ ♪ But I ain't finished, I'm devoted ♪ - Black Skinhead was a very controversial video because it got leaked online before Kanye was done with it. You know, Kanye is one of the most controlling, famously kind of OCD artists out there and bearing in mind he had a hugely successful career as a producer before he became a solo artist. He really takes control from the beginning to the end of everything he does. He quickly took it down, he rejigged a little bit and then released it himself a week later. 2013 also proved to be a personal milestone for Kanye, as he became a father for the first time with partner Kim Kardashian giving birth to a baby girl in June of that year. - After Kim and Kanye started dating relatively quickly, she fell pregnant she had a very difficult pregnancy. The first thing was that we noticed was she put on a lot of weight and for Kim Kardashian, that is, I mean that's a fate worse than death, probably not to be slim and beautiful. So she struggled a lot with that and the press made fun of her in various outfits. And compared and very unkindly talked about her during her pregnancy in that way and I think that was very painful for her. But additionally, and far more seriously, she had actual physical issues, she had preeclampsia, which meant she had to deliver North early and then following the birth, she had a placental abruption, which meant that she had to have the placenta removed and it was also again life threatening and serious. Kanye and Kim became engaged in October 2013 and married on May 24th 2014 in Florence, Italy. - Kim and Kanye's wedding in 2013 was the biggest showbiz story of the year. So they decide to get married, there's a huge proposal that ends up on YouTube. And then they decide that the wedding is gonna be in France. Versailles, beautiful, wonderful. All of the guests get flown to France, only to be told the night before the wedding, that they're getting flown to Florence in Italy. This is what happens when you got Kanye in charge of wedding plans. Anything is possible. He wants to make changes at the last minute and Kim says yes because why not? They've got the money to do so. In May 2015, it was announced that Kim and Kanye were expecting their second child. On June 21st 2015, Kim confirmed via Instagram that she and Kanye were expecting a boy in December 2015. - Following the birth of North,she did get pregnant again with Saint and carried to term. But again had all kinds of medical issues and was advised, according to her in the show, that she should not be pregnant anymore and so they had gestational carriers carry the next two babies. - I think Kanye's got quite broad shoulders when it comes to dealing with attention on him. I think actually he's just quite like that. Then again, being with the Kardashians brings a whole another level of scrutiny on you. They are the biggest reality stars in the world. Everyone knows them across the globe. I think what's surprising about Kanye is that he actually allowed himself to be featured on the reality show. I didn't think he'd wanna be associated, really, with that product but he seems to be okay with it. The other side of it is the Kardashian women haven't had the best luck in relationships with guys who have appeared on the show so you didn't worry, would that jinx things but he seems to have taken it in his stride. The next month, Kanye headlined the Glastonbury Festival in U.K. despite a petition signed by almost 135,000 people against his appearance. Toward the end of the set, he proclaimed himself the greatest living rock star on the planet. - Kanye West is one of those artists you either love or you hate. A lot of people have called Kanye West, like Rolling Stone Magazine, one of the greatest artists of our time. But there are plenty of other people who fail to see the magic of Kanye, including the crowds at Glastonbury. In fact, when Glastonbury organizers announced that Kanye West was going to headline, they actually got death threats. You know, there's a lot of people who fail to see the talent and vision of this artist. And I suppose, you know, Kanye who considers himself the greatest artist of all time, would say that, you know, prophets, I mean, like Jesus, who he compares himself to, aren't always appreciated at the time is probably what he would say. But I just think not everybody likes his music. Not everybody thinks that he's quite as good as he thinks he is. - In the last few years, I think probably starting with Jay-Z in 2008, there's this annoying habit of fairly reactionary Glastonbury goers making a big fuss that gets picked up by the media about how so and so, Jay-Z or Metallica or whoever, does not deserve to play Glastonbury. So there was this massive petition with thousands of signatories say that Kanye was a kind of, booking Kanye was a disgrace and he had nothing to do with the spirit of Glastonbury. And it is kind of ridiculous because there's tons of different people who play Glastonbury, there isn't one thing that you're allowed there and there is something about Kanye that really riles people. He's hugely outspoken in an abrasive way. And I think people particularly,some people particularly find it difficult coming from a black man, coming from a rapper. And as everyone is entitled to like or dislike an artist, but I do think there's a kind of an unsavory undercurrent to how much people hate Kanye, whose I think artistic achievements on some level, are kind of inarguable the way that he's reshaped music, his influence is sort of undeniable, even if you don't like him. And he had every right to be there. What surprised me at Glastonbury was that beforehand, I was saying this is either gonna be one of the best things ever or one of the worst things. There was a real thrill of like, what's gonna happen? And I was watching it and it started off and it was fantastic for the first few songs and it was just on stage on his own with this bank of lights, and it was kind of intense and weird and paranoid and stark. And then nothing else really happened and as it proceeded and around me people were looking a bit bored. And they weren't angry and they weren't thrilled. They were just like, "Oh, is that it?" And that in a way disappointed me more than if it had been terrible because I thought, "Oh dear people should not be reacting to Kanye "in a kind of shrugging way." And it was a real if you're star rating the reviews, it was a sort of three out of five set when you wanted it to really be like one or five. You wanted him to polarize and within the field, he didn't really polarize. There were good bits of the set, and there were bad bits to the set. And it almost felt like he fell to earth a little bit and I know that he was quite unhappy with aspects of that performance. ♪ And we'll do anything when the time's right ♪ ♪ Uh, baby, you're making it ♪ Harder, better, faster, stronger ♪ ♪ Baby, you're making it ♪ Now that that don't kill me ♪ Can only make me stronger ♪ I need you to hurry up now ♪ Cause I can't wait much longer ♪ ♪ I know I got to be right now ♪ Cause I can't get much wronger ♪ ♪ Man, I've been waiting all night now ♪ ♪ That's how long I been on ya On the 14th of February 2016, Kanye finally released his much anticipated eighth studio album. The album went through four name changes before Kanye finally settled with "The Life of Pablo". - What was really interesting about "The Life of Pablo" was it was kind of an evolving living album, unlike any other album that had come before. Rather than having that official release, this is the end product it's done and dusted and just enjoy it what is. He continued tinkering with it and editing it after it'd being released. So the final product wasn't really the final product. It was evolving. So that was interesting. I think, as well with the sound of "The Life of Pablo" it was more organic, maybe family sound, I think you could tell that his home life kind of seeped into that record, sort of like gospel stuff in there and religious references and just kind of warm, uplifting album that showed he's hopefully back to his best and he's moved on from his mental health troubles. - The album "The Life of Pablo" people like that more. It seemed like people are really feeling the vibe of it and everything. It's because I was able to make the Yeezys. You know what I'm saying? I guess as a creative person, you gotta have a bunch of creative outlets. - Kanye's in quite a strange phase creatively because he's sort of famed for producing albums which are very complete cohesive works. Very different to the one that came before, maybe you know dropped unannounced still impressive. And with "The Life of Pablo", it was talked about for over a year before it came out. It had different titles, he released singles that ended up not appearing on it. And then they're kind of reinstated. There was this messy launch and then the confusion over whether it was gonna be, how it was going to be available until you can be able to buy it on CD and then you couldn't because it was only gonna be through Tidal. And then because it was on a streaming platform and nobody actually owned it, he was then able to kind of tinker with it. So there was a sense in which at one point you think, is this record ever gonna be finished? Was he just gonna keep working on it? And it's quite a strangely messy, oddly sequenced record anyway. And from somebody that's used to sort of coming out with these quite emphatic statements, there's a strange sort of development which makes me wonder if perhaps there's some uncertainty or self doubt or what exactly he's trying to achieve by having this kind of constantly unfinished album. Kanye premiered the new album at Madison Square Garden as a part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. The album was met with mixed reviews from critics. Rolling Stone Magazine dubbed it both a mess and a masterpiece. However, despite the reviews, the album was still able to make it to number one on the US Billboard 200. - At the time, "The Life of Pablo" was released, it was actually the most successful streamed album. It still went to number one in the charts. It was released only on Tidal through his pal's Jay-Z's streaming service. But despite that limited release, it's still racked up platinum status and was the first album to do so. After Life of Pablo's release, Kanye's music career seem to be back on form. However, in late 2016, Kanye experienced a series of events which really affected his mental state. - I think one of the major factors that plays a part in his mental breakdown was Kim's robbery ordeal in Paris when massed armed robbers entered her hotel room, tied her up and stole millions of pounds worth of jewelry. - The five men all dressed as police officers entered through this door, they then handcuff the concierge before putting a gun to his head and demanding that he took them to her apartment. Kim Kardashian was then herself tied up, she has said to be badly shaken, but physically unharmed. - Kanye wasn't with her at the time, but understandably it had a massive effect on him knowing that his wife was in danger and how shaken up she was with it. Shortly after that, Kanye canceled his tour and he was hospitalized for a period of time where he underwent treatment for his mental health and his own benefit, really. - I think when two very famous people are in a relationship, there's sort of it operates on two levels on the one hand, it's these two people who are in love. And on that level, there's this great, the way that Kanye talks about Kim, the way that he responded when she was robbed in Paris, just going short up a show. Everything he says he reveals this great affection and admiration. And you know, he loves the family they started together. He thinks she's just a fantastic human being, an entrepreneur. But then it's also this kind of chemical reaction of two very famous people, makes life very hard and much harder than if he was with somebody who was not in the public eye. And she's very good at being famous. She's very kind of relaxed. It's like, that's her art form is celebrity. Whereas his art form are elsewhere, it's music and he would like thinking of fashion and art and all these other things. And he's not actually very good at being famous. He can't relax into it. When you compare him to Jay-Z, his friend and mentor. Jay-Z again, very good at it, very smooth and Kanye just seems so stressed out by fame. And yet, now more than ever, he can't escape it. These events really damaged Kanye's career leading to a vast array of controversial outburst. - One of the things is really hard to work out with Kanye is how much of his provocations are calculated to sort of get attention or to make points. And how much is simply him splurging. And I think there's been quite a few cases where somebody has set him off, there's been a tweet or there's been someone making fun of him on a chat show and he lashes out. And that, to me, doesn't seem like a thought through thing and I sometimes wonder about his stage invasions at award ceremonies. Is he thinking in the car on the way there that's what I'm gonna do or does it just sort of erupt and there's probably like a bit of both but I think a lot of his more outrageous tweets it's just him uncensored. And then I think he feels that there's a value in being uncensored. So he doesn't then go back and regret or apologize for all these things. But I think a lot of it comes out spontaneously and then he justifies it. And some of the stuff I find as a fan is kind of embarrassing. It's like, why are you wasting your time doing that? Why are you feuding with this person? Why are you making this kind of crass remark? Why are you sort of stooping to that? But that's because that's him. That's part of him that he can make this fantastic art and then make you put your head in your hands with some stupid tweet. After his rehab visit, Kanye surprisingly met with the then President Elect, Donald Trump to discuss politics and life. News footage of the meeting showed a peculiar side to Kanye as he just smiled and said nothing during the whole press conference. - I think Kanye meeting with Donald took everyone by surprise because Donald wasn't known for being popular among the black community. And seeing Kanye visit him at Trump Tower and then have a rather lengthy conversation and come out and endorse the president was quite surprising. - I made a hat that said, "Make America Great" without the again and Trump wore the hat because he said he's willing to adjust because he realized that the word again hurts us as people, specifically black people, the idea. Because we say, "When was America ever great for us?" So we made and updated hat that said, "Make America Great" and Trump wore the hat. So he is open to adjusting and listening. I just wanted y'all to put this online so everyone can definitely see it. - I think despite Trump winning the election, I think among Kanye fans, they weren't too pleased that he had endorsed Trump because of some of the controversial things he'd said. He seems kind of backtracked on that support that he gave him but I think the damage was already done when he was pictured at the meeting and what he came out with after that. - I think it's the bravery that helps you beat this game called life. They try to scare me to not wear this hat, my own friends, but this hat it gives me power in a way. On top of that, Kanye was still getting involved with online Twitter controversies having a go at a variety of organizations and individuals such as the Grammys, music critics, and even stating that he is the greatest rapper of all time. - Kanye's mother said that one of the things he got from his father was this sort of intolerance for injustice. And sometimes that manifests itself in a political statement. And then at other times what he defines as injustice seems kind of trivial. It's like he's upset because he hasn't got a Grammy or an MTV award. And his rage about those things, seems to be equivalent to his rage about political things. In fact, sometimes it seems to eclipse that from some more about award shows than he has about Black Lives Matter. And he has the sense in a way that success is like a science or like sport and that there are rules and there are winners and losers and it should just be obvious who is the best and who isn't. And of course, in art, it's not like that and people just have preferences and maybe they prefer another video to his video or a Beyonce video. And there's part of him that just cannot accept that and despite his enormous success, feels, in some way, hard done by. It was easy to say that at this point in Kanye's career, his mental state and attitude to life had changed from his earlier career. - This thing that the media tries to make this ongoing story and everything for hits and about that. I don't think people care about me and her in that way. People care about their families. If you like my music, listen to it. After a period of Kanye only hitting headlines for controversy reasons, some positivity was much needed. This came in 2018 when Kanye and his wife, Kim announced the birth of their third child. A daughter named Chicago who was born via gestation carrier in January. - For that third child Kim decided to use a surrogate rather than giving birth naturally. There was a lot of media speculation about who the surrogate was. I understand the family wanted to keep that private. They did let people know that they had handpicked this person, they were happy with her carrying the baby. The couple's happy news reaped high level of media coverage, not just because of Kenya's recent trouble but also because of their daughters manner of birth and her name. - Kim's always been quite open about why she used a surrogate. She has couple of high risk conditions after her previous births that could cause harm to her and potentially the baby. So her and Kanye explored all the options available to them and they decided that surrogacy was definitely the best option for them. In May 2019, Kanye and wife Kim, welcomed their fourth child, Psalm West. On January 6th 2019, West started his weekly Sunday service church orchestration. Which includes soul variations of both West and others songs attended by multiple celebrities. - Kanye himself has had some kind of spiritual reawakening related to his Christian faith. And he has been expressing that through the setting up of what he calls his Sunday service, where he performs and organizes a Sunday service. The location changes, it's by invitation only. It's not a normal church, it's usually outside. He controls and tells people what to wear, there's a dress code because, God forbid, Kanye's senses are assaulted by ugly colors or fabrics. And he has a choir that he leads and they sing and it's mostly singing. - They say like with this whole like Sunday service is supposed to spread positivity. Promoting it. - Yeah, so that's the whole point of this, it's supposed to bring everybody together and just have a good time and just vibe as well and enjoy his music. - As Kim has said, there's no preaching, there's no sermon, it's a lot of singing, and it's a chance to just connect to a higher power. A lot of celebrities go, we've seen Brad Pitt there on more than one occasion. We've seen the Kardashian clan,Kendall is there frequently and they attend and it is, a lot of criticism has been leveled at it because it seems like everyone's worshiping Kanye. In fact, the other choir members are seen as his disciples. And we do know he calls himself Ye and even like this whole Jesus kind of comparison. So there has been some criticism that Kanye has actually created sort of a cult of Kanye. Are they worshiping him or are they worshiping God? Kanye says no, I mean his album was called "Jesus is King". So he would argue that that's not true. But this has been a real expression, I think, of his personal re commitment to Christianity. ♪ Jesus walks ♪ Jesus walks ♪ Jesus walks with me ♪ Jesus walks ♪ Jesus walks ♪ Jesus walks with me - Interestingly, and unsurprisingly, Kanye's newfound faith has caused tension at home, he doesn't want North wearing makeup, he doesn't want him wearing all the sexy outfits that she favors. He wants her to tone it down as his wife, which is, you know, fair enough. But Kim is not happy with this. She doesn't want the rules changed at this stage of the game. And that has definitely been a source of tension which we've seen play out on the show. Kanye performed the first public Sunday service at Coachella on Easter weekend, April 2019. ♪ You're the only power ♪ That can save this world today ♪ ♪ Power ♪ Power ♪ Power ♪ Power that can save us today ♪ Beautiful morning - I think it's more of a message of spreading kindness, caring for others, especially in a society in which we live today. I think that's important. And so if we're not gonna listen to our parents, well, we're gonna listen to Kanye. - He performs a lot of that type of music that are performed in churches around the world and the country. So it's not like it's just his music and he's not even the one that's doing most of the performances in the past. Like he has other people helping him out. And he's just kind of there to promote it and do his thing and vibe to it like everyone else is I guess. On October 25th 2019, he released "Jesus is King", a Christian hip-hop album. On the U.S. charts, the album became the first to ever top the billboard 200 top RnB hip-hop albums, top rap albums, top Christian albums and top gospel albums at the same time. On December 25th 2019, Kanye released a sort of prequel album to "Jesus is King" called "Jesus is Born". This is also a part of this gospel Sunday service. It has 19 songs, which includes a cover of West's own song, "Ultralight Beam". ♪ We on an ultralight beam ♪ This is a God dream ♪ This is a God dream ♪ This is everything ♪ This is everything ♪ We on an ultralight beam ♪ We on an ultralight beam ♪ This is a God dream ♪ This is a God dream - I believe that the world can be changed, the world can be saved through design, through unselfish design, through unselfish creation. Despite Kanye West's outspoken behavior, it is hard to deny that he is one of hip-hop's most influential rappers the world has ever seen. - Kanye West will definitely be remembered as one of the greatest rappers of all time when all is said and done. His production is second to none, even throughout his meltdown that he had, it hasn't done too much to dent his reputation. Even his reality star family, love them or hate them, haven't done anything to take away from the quality of his music. I think if he keeps innovating the way he has done, he's gonna be remembered as one of the best for sure. - We were never trying to make radio, we were trying to break radio. That's a lot of artistic freedom. We keep on trying to break records and allow the artist to be free. That's the whole movement. Kanye's future may always be uncertain but it is safe to say that his legacy will live on and his albums will go down in history as some of the most influential albums of the 21st century. - People make the mistake of taking Kanye too literally when he's making these bombastic statements. And one of the reasons he does it is because it's sort of gets attention. Another thing is to goad himself into being better if you make these outlandish claims, you have to try and at least live up to them. Plus, there's always been a tradition in hip-hop of saying you're the best. Way back when people in the first ever hip-hop record, people were saying how great they were with women or how good their watch was. And he's doing that, he's doing it on this kind of massive nuclear scale. Kanye's genius is noticeable around the world and he will forever be one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time.
