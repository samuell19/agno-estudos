As my blood flows... ...the power of my curse grows. This is my desire. This is my promise. Khai. You startled me. Arrived a while ago? Been a while. Only Lili is not here yet. The others are over there. They're shopping. Let's go. -Let's go. Kat, just one bag for you? -Hey, Khai. It's fine. -No, Kat. Don't be shy with me. I got this. Alright then, thanks. -Let's go. Let's go. Hi! -What's up? You good, Mark? -Good. You good, bro? Hi! -Hello. Okay, let's go! Where is Lili? -No idea where she is. Did she text you? -We still have time to shop. This hat is nice. Do I look handsome? What kinda colour is that? Oh, not nice? -Okay I guess. Kat. How about this bracelet? Pretty. There's a story behind this. If a boy put this on a girl he likes... ...they will never be apart. Like a handcuff. Do you believe it? That's crazy. I don't buy it. Let me prove it to you. Now wear this. Hi guys! Lili is here! Lili! Miss you. -Me too. Is he your mysterious cousin? This is Ben, my cousin. These are my college friends. Hi, guys. -Hi. Khai. -Ben. Okay, guys. Since Lili is here... ...let's move. Let's go. -Let's move. Yeah, I'm excited. Let's go! Great resort choice, babe! Of course. -High Class. Welcome. -Hi, bro. Please check in here. Woah, there are some brochures over here. I think there must be a lot of islands to explore. What's with the shirt? -It's all about the feel. Dauz. Who is she? Are you trying to mess up my trip again? What are you doing here? That is Yus's stepsister. They just to love quarrel. Why? Do you own this resort now? Baby, don't let them bother you. They are in different class. -You're right. Fine. Let's go to our penthouse suite. Bye bye! The sister is kinda hot, right? Hey! It's okay. Just chill. We are on a holiday. Check out some brochures. So many interesting places! We can go island hopping tomorrow. Really? That's sounds fun. -Let's see. Hey. Seems like a lot of deserted islands here. Yes. I thought I saw you in there too. You mean I look like a deserted island? Yeah. You seem like a loner in the group. I'm just kidding, I hope you are not. Of course not. You use your birthday as your password? Seriously? Why not? My tablet is as precious as me. Oh wait! My followers just increased. Don't! Don't! Stop, let me go! Moli, we will never be apart. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. You see something again? No I heard something. Like..... Like someone calling me. This time it's different. So weird it's like... You know what. Nevermind. I'm okay. Okay? -Hey! Dauz's inviting us to the swimming pool. Let's go. Come on. Let's go and relax. You have to open up remember? -I know. It's a holiday. Let's go. -Okay. Okay, okay! Be careful! You're ruining my bracelet! When will you give it to Kat? Don't tell me what to do. I know what I'm doing. The moment will come. -Moment? How much longer? Five more years? Come on, Khai. You better confess to her soon. I think that guy Ben is after her too. I know Kat. She's not into guys like Ben. You should learn from your brother. Me and Yus. Anytime we're always ready! Dauz, I know you like to have fun. But whatever you are doing, you must never go too far,... ...understand? Anyway I'm not lecturing you. You're old enough now. You really care about me. Go away! You're annoying. I love you, bro! Hey bro, actually what's your deal? Are you here for the diving? If not? -I thought maybe you're like me. Honestly, I'm here just for the bikinis. I'm here because I want to let go of something. Ben, you are supposed to enjoy your life. And the best way to let go..... Look. She is so hot! Imagine she is with me. Bad luck though, we're sharing room. I can always take a cigarette break. Just do whatever you fancy. It's three cigarettes break,... ...because I can go on all night. So cool! What do you want to eat? -I'll get for you. Hey, guys! Let me help you. That's a lot of food. That's too much! Thank you. -Guys, look at me. Excuse me, one please. This is my chance. What is he doing? Hey, you're Kitty, right? I'm Mark. So? -So... ...let me show you... ...a magic trick. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Woah! -That's beautiful. Shall we dance? -Let's go. Lili, do you want to dance? Let's go. -Let's go. Bye, bro. Kat. -Yeah? Let's dance. Maybe not. You should join them. I'm watching the fire show. Oh the fire show. -Yeah. Let me accompany you. Sure, let's go. Come on. -Alright, coming. Alright! We only have one boat. Two groups go together. Okay? -Thank you. Are we going to a special place today? Why do you ask? Seems like you're praying. This is for our blessing. That thing can protect us? I inherited this from my ancestors. True protection can only come from above. Is everyone ready? -Yeah! One, two, three, go! Hey, what a beautiful island! Can you bring us there? -Sorry, miss. We don't bring people to that island. What a bummer. Dauz, go talk to the boatman. Give him some persuasion. Sure. Sir, can swing by that island for a while? No, that's a forbidden island. How about some extra tips? Rules are rules. Please sit down, we are arriving. Give me my sunblock. -Guys. Can you take my photos later please? Look at me, guys. Khai, where is Kat? She hasn't come up. Wasn't she with you just now? -No, I thought she's with you. It's okay, you wait here. Let me go find her. Wait! Eddie. -Okay. I call upon in the name of blood,... ...earth, water, wind, and fire. I beg for protection of my homeland. Kat! -What happened, Khai? Kat! Oh my God! Kat! Kat! -Kat? Give us some space, please! You scared me. Okay, okay now it's okay. Are you okay? I warned you already. But you still went ahead. You scared me. Kat, are you okay? Each of our islands comes with its own legend. That particular island that you saw today... ...possesses the darkest past amongst them all. Almost two hundred years ago... ...that island was cursed by a brutal woman. And caused the death of all its inhabitants. Until this day... ...none of the corpses were ever found. Never found? No. Not even one. And according to the legend... ...the curse still exists to this day. What happened to her? Maybe she turned into a ghost. And tried to drown you this morning. What happened this morning could be a warning sign. Everyone of you must take this seriously. Treat this as a reminder. Okay, see you tomorrow morning. Good night. -Good night. That was loads of crap! Bunch of cowards. -Who you calling cowards? Those who talk big usually have no balls. Okay, fine. Let's do a bet now. Are you in? Khai. What's the stake? Whoever's leg got caught will be out. The gang that loses... ...stays one night on that island. You dare? The bet is on! Alright, Yus. -Yaya. Come on. -Go, Kitty! Help! Help me! What a beautiful view, isn't it? Let me quickly share with you what I experienced so far. To be very honest I could really tell... ...the tourism industry got hit quite badly by the pandemic. But if you look at the bright side,... ...the environment, finally had time to heal and recover. Oh guys, I need to tell you this. I'm doing something crazy today. I am taking up a challenge. To stay overnight on a deserted island. Wish me luck. What are you thinking about? Nothing much. Just about the island we are going. Don't tell me you are guilty about it? No. Remember I told you... ...the voice that was calling me. Well ever since then I've been getting these dreams. Weird ones like visions and... ...I think the visions I saw that night... ...are related to the island. This island? -Yeah. Hey, that's creepy. -No, it's not creepy. It's just maybe..... After what the boatman said yesterday... ...I don't know maybe I feel nervous a bit. What are you nervous about? Nothing much. Don't worry, I'm here. I have prepared everything. Is it? -Look. I have sunblock for you. This and snacks, and this too. Woah, Khai, you're well prepared. Of course, Kat. If you need me I'm here for you always, okay? Thanks, Khai. -You are welcome. Kat, actually I..... Hey! Come on! They are ready. Come on! Let's move. Mark, are you okay? Let's go! Thank you. Hey, come back as soon as you can. The dare hasn't even started yet. Rest in peace, bro! Guys! We will be back for your dead bodies tomorrow! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven! Guys! This may not be a bad idea. Finally we have our own place. Like private beach guys! She's right. We can do whatever we want here. Let's go for a dip! -Let's go! What are you waiting for? I think you guys are too chilled. Are you sure? One, two, three! -Hey, no please, no! Kat, come on. Guys! Do you really believe in the boatman's story? Not me. Stop pretending, Mark. If you're so tough, why are you so afraid to come here? It has been a very long time... ...since I last enjoyed the beach with my friends. They are chilling over there. Look. You do believe, right? I think, there must be a reason why... ...they forbid us to come here. Ben, what about you? I'm with Kat. I need to see and experience it first hand. So you want to see the ghost? Hey, guys! Did you see that? There's a hornbill! It's flying away! Hurry! -Hey, Lili! Hold on, wait! Hey, Lili wait! Wait for me, Lili. Over there. Hey! Over there! Lili wait for us! -Lili! Be careful, Lili. Wait! This way, guys! Wait! Slow down, Lili! You got this. It's gone. Hey, wait. What's up with you? Be more adventurous. Let me go check it out. Lili? -Where is she? Lili! Told you nothing's going to happen. Why are you so scared? Come on. Hey. It's getting late. Since we're stuck here... ...let's all just stay together. Okay? Okay. What is this? -I'm not sure. Looks like a charm. Look there's more. That house has one too. It's everywhere. Hey! Hey! Guys! You're doing it all wrong. Stop it! Look what you've done. This is wrong. Show some respect here. Babe, don't be so serious. We are just having fun. Don't worry, nothing happened. I think this has gone too far. Okay, okay. Fine. Anyway guys, I've checked the old house. The roof still looks okay. Let's sleep there tonight. Not a bad idea. Better than camping, right? It's okay. Guys! Tonight, all kind of ghosts and spirits will come visit us. Really? Don't forget the long haired one! With the long crooked finger nails. So be careful. Later when we're asleep... ...you will feel her saliva dripping on your face. And slowly... ...she will haunt you! Guys, do your part. This place is so small, we can do it later. Stay where you are. Maybe you are new here. Kat is my girl. Stay away from her. It's okay. Let me help. -Sorry. Khai. Are we really sleeping here tonight? It's giving me the creeps. Any suggestion? Better than camping, right? Hey Khai, wait for me. What's your problem? Nothing. Lili? Lili? Dear. No! Don't do that! Let me go! No! Listen. Nobody shall talk about this ever again understand. Understand. We shall never forget... ...for the love that was taken away. We shall remember for thousands of years,... ...for the suffering and pain. We shall remember forever. As my blood flows... ...the power of my curse grows. Let my body remain. Let my spirit be immortal. As I drink my blood dry. Death upon the island. My power will grow, my curse will be fulfilled. I shall dwell here forever. This is my desire. This is my promise. This is my curse. Our princess is awake. Mosquitoes are everywhere. You got bitten too? Duh, this is the jungle. Bring your phone. We're going fishing. -I'm going too. Are you okay? I'm okay. Guys! Look what I got! There's no network here. I just tried. What do you mean? I had one bar just now. I'll go elsewhere. Guys? What? How did you get this photo? This is so creepy. This looks just like my dream. Serious? -Your dream? Actually I..... It's hard to explain. Can we just keep this to ourselves for now? Because I don't want them to panic. Okay? -You are right. I mean, we are leaving soon anyway. I don't think they will come today. Damn it. I knew it. They pranked us again. Must be my sister's idea. Guys. Forgot about them. Let's decide where we will sleep tonight? How about the old house? I don't want. I agree with Lili. Let's not go back. How about this? We put to a vote. Majority wins. Who vote for the old house? I am okay. Do I have a choice? Your prank idea was brilliant! -Thank you. But I still feel we've gone too far. What if something happen to them? You worry too much, dear. Aren't we picking them up tomorrow? Hello sir, have you eaten? What did you just say? Where are you going tomorrow? Picking who up? The other gang. We won a bet against them. So..... Where are they now? They're at that island you talked about. Just relax. We are going to..... I already warned all of you. Do not go to that island. But you guys just couldn't help it. Eddie, call them. What is this all about? You listen carefully. If you see... ...an abandoned village in the jungle,... ...do not enter. Because the village was once attacked by... ...an evil creature possessed by black magic. Why can't we go back to the same house? Now we have to clean up all over again. It's so tiring. It's okay. We'll do it. This place isn't that big anyway. Yeah but why? Can you give me a hand? Hold my towel while I change. Sure, let me put my hands in good use. Okay. Babe, have you seen fireflies before? Fireflies? -Yeah. Where? It's a surprise. But only both of us. Okay. Don't lie to me. Okay. Are you ready? Hey. Guys? Kill! Kill her! You will pay for your sins! Nobody will escape tonight! What's wrong? Are you okay? What's wrong? Something is very wrong about this place. Remember I told you about my dream. I kept seeing an ancient woman from a different time. Hey, watch where you pee. You're so disgusting. Let's go. Babe? So you are telling me... ...that woman turned into a witch... ...and killed all the villagers? Yes. -What has that got to do with... ...you know, us? I think there's something purposely brought me here. To tell me a sign. Something..... I have sixth sense, do you believe me? So you can see ghosts? I can communicate with the dead. Actually during that barbecue night,... ...I saw a woman's spirit beside you. She looked so gentle. So I think she must be someone very close to you. She has a mole here. Yes. She's my mom. She died because of COVID-19. Ben. I'm so sorry. -I don't believe this. Guys! Guys! Yus! Are you okay? Dauz is gone! What? -He got pulled away by something. What do you mean? What? -He just disappeared. Yus, bring me there. Now. We were watching fireflies... ...then suddenly he got yanked from behind. Guys, I will go that way... ...and you search other areas. Dauz! Hey, Dauz! Dauz! Dauz! Dauz! Be careful, Kat. -Are you okay? Dauz! Babe! -Dauz! Babe! Dauz! Dauz! Dauz! Dauz? I can't hear them anymore. I think we better go back. Let's regroup first. Yeah. Okay. Bro. Let's go back to the house first. Maybe Dauz is already back. Who's your, bro? If you want to go back, just go! I don't need you here. I just worry about everyone's safety. It's very dark out here. It could be dangerous. Ben is right. I think we should go back. What are you even saying, Mark? That's my brother you're talking about! He's also your friend! If you're scared, just go! I will find him myself! But Khai, we've been out over an hour already. Khai. We know how you feel. You're worry for Dauz. And so are we but if you stay here alone... ...we may have to come find you too. Come back with us. Let's search again in the morning, okay? I promise Khai. Follow me. Come on. Khai. Are you okay? Kat. I think we have to split up. Split up? This place is huge. I think if we split up, we have better odds in finding Dauz. Bro. I think we shouldn't split up. Like you said this is a huge island. What if something happened? I suggest we stay together..... -No one asking for you opinion! Khai. Calm down, Khai. I agree too. Let's stay as a group for now. If we still can't find Dauz then we split up. Okay? Fine! -I suggest I stay here. You guys go ahead. Just in case he comes back. Why do we have to come too? I don't want to bring you guys along either. But it's been three days since we last saw them. You guys started this mess. So you must now fix this. Let's go find them. And God willing, they are all safe. Dauz! Babe! -Dauz! Dauz! -Dauz! Babe! Dauz! -Dauz! Dauz! Dauz! Babe! Dauz! Dauz! Dauz! Dauz! Lili. I dare not tell them. Especially Khai. I fear something bad has happened to Dauz. Something bad? -Yes. Is it because you saw it from your dreams? Yes. Ever since I came to this island my dreams..... Last night, I saw a witch. Witch? Guys, hurry up! Later, okay? It's going to rain soon. That's why we need to move faster. Eddie! What's wrong? Okay, Eddie, close it. Kitty? Did you just get here? Khai? Khai! Let's go find a shelter. What is it now? We haven't found Dauz yet! Yes but..... -Come, let's go this way. We passed this way before. How do you know? -Look. I did the marking. We better go back. Everyone's soaking wet. So? We just forget about Dauz and leave? You! That's your own boyfriend! Stop yelling at everyone! No one here wants to abandon Dauz. But we're not getting anywhere. Let's go find Mark... ...and plan our next step. Let me show you a magic trick. Mark? Mark! This happened again. It took Dauz. Now it came for Mark too! No, no. He must have wandered off somewhere. But the bags are still here. Okay, now we have to stay in a group. Don't split up again. Let's search all the houses here. If we can't find them, we head to the beach. What's the point of going to the beach? Maybe Desmond's boat has arrived. We can get them to help. Mark! Mark! Mark! What a waste of time! Kat, I think it's about time you tell them what you saw. About that photo. What is he saying? Shit! I have sixth sense. And since we came here... ...I've been getting these visions..... You listen carefully. If you see... ...an abandoned village in the jungle,... ...do not enter. Because that place was once attacked... ...by an evil witch possessed with black magic. To stop the killings the villagers... ...called upon a shaman to destroy the witch. But the witch's curse was too powerful... ...that the shaman had to sacrifice himself... ...by turning the statues into amulets... ...and that becomes a protective shield for the Island. So if you come across the village,... ...do not touch anything. Be careful! So you think we may have broken the shield? I vaguely saw this in my dreams like what the boatman said. I saw the shaman trying to stop the witch. He was protecting the village. -That same village we entered. Hey! They have arrived! You guys! -Here! Hurry up, guys! Hey, I can see them! Guys, are you okay? -Guys! Yus! -Guys! Faster! What should we do now? We need to go back there. No! No! Yus! We have to. We have to find a way to escape. We shouldn't have come here. We shouldn't have made that bet. Now they're all gone. Yaya is gone. Yus. -Just because of one stupid bet... ...everyone is dead. -Hey, don't panic! Okay? We can't think straight if we are panic. Everybody just calm down! Do we have to go back there? Yes. We need to know... ...what happened to Mark. What happened to Dauz. Come. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Babe. We need to go back to where Dauz disappeared. Are you okay? In my dream... ...I saw a man buried here. I need help to dig. Moli. Come with me. Moli, we will never be apart. I've warned you. This is forbidden. He's an outsider with braided hair. But I love him. He's now my husband. -This village will not allow this. You cannot commit such sin. No! No! Let me go! Let me go! Moli! Let me go! The man was buried here. He's the woman's husband. The villagers killed him. So she cursed the entire village? -Yes. What about the photo on our phone? Maybe to give us a warning? They are still alive. I'm sure they're still alive. We have to find a way to break that curse. The deadly curse. Or else we will be stuck here forever. But how can we break it? In your dreams you saw her turn into a witch, right? Can you remember where? Let's find that place. And I think that's where the curse began. Cave. Cave. She casted the spell in the cave. Let's go find it. I'm not sure why am I recording this. I've just lost two friends. I really hope all of this is just a bad dream. We can get out of here. We will survive. I am scared. I know, I know. Hey. You are going to be okay. Okay? I promise. Let's go. Guys. Something is following us. Be careful. No matter what... ...let's stay together, alright. Seriously? We have to cross this? I will cross first... ...then you just follow my steps. Okay? -Be careful, Khai. Come. Yus, are you okay? Lili, I will go with Yus first, okay? Are you okay? Ben, please take my bag. Ben! Lili! -Lili! Lili! Lili! Lili! Lili! Lili! Lili! Lili! Lili! Lili! -Lili! Lili! Lili! Lili! Lili! Why do we even bother now? You saw that creature! It can kill us in a split second. No point looking for the cave now! Because I don't want you to die too! Only the four of us left now. Let's go. Ben. We have to go. Ben, I'll rest first. Then I'll take your shift. You know. I started smoking as a kid. My mother would nag everyday,... ...telling me to stop smoking. After a long time I did quit. Recently I started smoking again. Because I feel like..... I feel like..... I miss my mum. I really miss my mum, Kat. I want to hear her voice again. Even if its just her nagging... ...telling me to stop smoking, you know? Mom really loved Lili. She always said, "She's my favourite niece." Lili was my best friend. She was the only person that truly understood me. I came here because of her too. She always told me... ...don't be a loner. Open up. Have fun. She was my best friend. She's gone. I lost her. We lost her but this is not your fault Kat. You got to stop blaming yourself. Please listen to me. I just want you to be safe. Whatever happens,... ...you run,... ...just go. -I can't. I cannot. Ben. Ben. Ben..... Ben..... Ben..... Mum? -Ben, my son. I was wrong, Mum. I couldn't protect Lili. I miss you so much. But that spear has magical powers. I couldn't hug you. Ben..... -Mum. Ben! No. She's not your mum. Ben..... Ben. That's not your mum. What's that? Yus? Oh, come here. I'm okay. Done. Let's go. Why do you always have to be a leader? What did I do wrong again? Hey. -Don't be like this. I don't like you from the moment we met. Always pretending to be the nice guy. The truth is you just wanted to get the girl! Khai! Look where we are. What nonsense are you talking about! Who am I trying to get? -Enough. Nonsense? Look at how many of us are left? Where is Yus? Where is Lili? They were taken by that creature. And it's all your fault! So you want to blame me? You think I left them on purpose? Think before you open your mouth! Enough! Enough! Enough! Why are you blaming each other now? He started it first. -I don't care who started this! It's just the three of us now! The rest are all gone. So we must stick together now. Guys. Can you see that? Hey! -What? If anything happens make sure Kat is safe. What's up with you? If that thing attacks us, bring Kat and run. You understand? What about you? Please forgive me. I didn't mean to do that. It's too late now. Accept the consequences. -No. No! No, no. No! No! No! Moli. We will never be apart. We will never be apart. Let me go! Moli! No! No! This is my love to you. My Moli, follow me. Moli, follow me. We will never be apart. Kat! Kat! Kat! Run! Kat! Run, Kat! Run! Go! This is the consequence! If you need me I'm here for you always. I just want you to be safe. Whatever happens... ...you run. Did you make it yourself? -It's for our baby. What if it's a boy? Doesn't matter boy or girl. My dear baby. This is my love to you. Take good care of it... ...and care for dad and mum too. Moli,... ...we will never be apart. Follow me. Moli. Moli. Your name is Moli? Moli. We..... We will never be apart. Moli, we will never be apart. We will never be apart. Your child... ...remembered everything that happened. Dear! Let me go! No! No! Let me go! -Swallow this! Dear! Dear! Dear! Dear! Oh my child. Remember this for hundred years to come. For the love that was taken away. Remember this for a thousand years. For the suffering and pain. Remember this. Vengeance awaits. Remember. Remember this, my dear. My family. My husband. My child. All vanished in that moment. I hate them all. What about my friends? Why did you kill them? What did they do to you? Because of your hatred. And your vengefulness. That was a long time ago. How much longer should this continue? My child died in vain. Your child? He is trapped in your memory. Your child is in torment too. Please... ...let go of your hatred. Let your child... ...and your soul... ...be set free. Find peace again. All that I have done... ...I did it for my child. Oh my child. Forget the love that was taken. Just forget... ...the suffering and pain. Forget it forever. Bury the vengeance. Forget. Oh please forget. Our love will never fade away. Kat! Run! Go! -Lili! We need to go back to the village. -It took Dauz. Don't ever enter there. Because of one stupid bet, everyone is dead. I really hope all of this just a bad dream. Please forgive me. -You are going to be okay. Kat! -What happened, Khai? Kat! Oh my God! Kat! Okay. Thank God. Are you okay, babe? We are so worried. Are you okay, Kat? Thank God. Are you okay? Thank you. Okay. Let's go back to the resort! Kat. -Yes? Are you really okay? -I'm fine. Actually I have been wanting to give you this. Can I put this on for you? That's fine. Let me put it in my bag instead, okay? Thanks, Khai. -You're welcome. Good move, bro. Hey. -Hi. You okay? -Yes, I'm okay. You sure? What happened just now? I feel like I'm fresh and new. Just like you, right? No more deserted island for me.
