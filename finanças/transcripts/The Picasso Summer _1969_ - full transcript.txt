[music continues] You look like the end of the world. Oh, not the end of the world, but, uh, the end of a project. When one's finished something of this size one's entitled to feel a bit flat. It's my contribution. I still feel a bit empty. Well, now what's gonna fill up my life? Well, I think I have an answer for tonight, anyway. - Oh, the party. - Mm-hmm. - Is it gonna be any good? - Well, I don't know. Who is this mysterious man whose house we're visiting? - Is he from your wicked past? - My wicked present. 'Oh.' [theme music] [music continues] [music continues] [car horn beeping] [whistle blowing] Darling, what's wrong? Oh, nothing. I was just thinking about that building I designed. A warehouse, a stupid warehouse. Come on, it'll be the best warehouse in San Francisco. Three months of my life, just so people will have a place to put everything they don't want. You'll love the party tonight. It'll cheer you up. Two hundred people designed that project, two thousand built it. By the time they get it up, it'll be obsolete. There'll be lots of interesting people there tonight. - You know something? - Mm-hmm? Your husband designed a big empty box. They wouldn't even let me put a toilet in it. [reggae music] [singing in foreign language] [crowd chattering] Excuse me. Hi, how are you? Hi, I'd like to present my husband. How've you been? John! John, I'd like you to meet my good friends Alice and George Smith. This is the new master, John William Round. John William Round, no last name. I'm sorry about that. Yeah. Uh, well, I hope you enjoy the paintings. So, what do you call this letter? - That's a "Q". - A "Q"! Isn't it marvelous? - Is that a real "T"? - That is a beautiful "T". [music continues] Aah! [singing in foreign language] [clock ticking] I'm sorry. It was such a stupid party, darling. Oh, there's nothing to be sorry about. We had nothing else to do. All those terrible people and that artist. Everyone seemed to be having a good time. Except you. Do you want to do anything tomorrow? I don't know. We have the whole week off. We could go some place if you like. I mean, we could just stay home, go to parties every night. You're not laughing. I guess I lost my ticklish spot. No "Reli-Oma"? Well, they say that's a sure sign of growing old. We could go and visit my folks. If you want to. That'll be jolly. "How are you, son? Fine dad." "You're looking well." "You're looking well too, mother." [sighs] "Alice, your hair seems lighter. Did you do something to it?" I don't think I feel like doing anything at all tonight. Goodnight. [clock ticking] [ticking continues] [chattering] [dramatic music] [soft music] [dramatic music] [theme music] [music continues] [sighs] - You're up? - 'Mm-hmm.' - Did you sleep well? - 'Uh-huh.' I don't think I've looked at those Picasso's since art school. Mm. They've been there since we've been married, George. I mean, really looked at 'em. - Alice. - Mm. Alice! Do you see what he's done? I mean, here, here, here, look, I mean.. He just doesn't see the world, he takes it apart and then he reforms it in his own way. Picasso's world. He's not governed like I am, by committees. He's not making boxes. He just does very simply and directly what he wants to do. Am I going on too much? [chuckles] Yes. I mean, he just doesn't see the world, he knows it. Let's go and find him. - To France? - 'Yes, of course.' 'Alice, come on. Let's just go.' But George! I need a passport. Vaccination. - I haven't got any clothes. - We could leave tonight. Wouldn't it be great to walk up to Picasso and say "For all the happiness you've given, we'd like to thank you?" - You're serious? - Yeah. - Now? - 'Now.' Now, now, now, now, now. Before the bomb goes off. Before I start another warehouse. And before I know what I'm talking about. - Then, we're going to France? - And to Picasso. Mmm. [theme music] [music continues] This is the country he's painted and lived in all these years. Isn't it marvelous? We're there. We're here, in it! It's marvelous. Is it a famous hotel? Well, not yet. It's lovely. Is Picasso's villa nearby? Well, this is his domain. I think his villa's in there somewhere. George, what makes you think we'll find it? We have to. We march up to the house and knock on the door. If it were that easy, everybody would do it. - Oh, we're not everybody. - No, we aren't, are we? Come on, sweetheart, let's go and case this joint. [seagulls squawking] [gasping] [gasping] Got the legs going. Keep 'em going. - Come on. Huh! - Uh! [both panting] [panting heavily] - Hey. - Huh? When are we gonna get started? Now, there's no hurry. Be calm. We gotta make.. ...plans and schemes, devise.. ...stratagems and.. ...means of...gaining entry to the great man. So, let's think. [panting] So, the first thing we've got to do is to find the museum. [theme music] [music continues] [music continues] Alice, look. Picasso. 'It's called the Shepherd Carrying His Lamb.' 'Picasso gave it to the town in, uh, 1945, after the war.' 'He meant it as a symbol that there was still hope.' 'Even Picasso can be wrong, you know.' [speaking in German] What? I, uh, I wondered if you would be so, so kind.. - To.. - To.. 'We would like one together.' Not at all, very happy to. - Dankeschoön. - Dankeschoön. Ready? There. - I hope it's alright. - Dankeschoön.Thank you, sir. - Thank you very much. - You're very welcome. Please, you have been so kind. You will come with us. - Perhaps, a Coca-Cola? - No, no. Thank you. Thank you. May I ask, have you been to the museum of Picasso? - We're going now. We go now. - You should, you should. Most impressive, most impressive. - Avidazen. - Avidazen. Schon. - That's a museum? - It's really a medieval chapel. But in 1954, when he was last here, Picasso filled the walls with two large murals, called War and Peace. He called it a dream tunnel. [footsteps echoing] [footsteps echoing] [classical music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [intense music] [music continues] [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [explosion] [explosion] [machine gun firing] [dog barking] [explosion] [people screaming] [explosion] [sirens wailing] [people screaming] [dramatic music] [thunder roaring] Where to now? Now, let's drop at the real Picasso. - Do you know where he lives? - We ask! Somebody must know. [theme music] [speaking in French] [shouting in French] [speaking in French] Bravo. Bravo. [speaking in French] Merci. [speaking in French] [speaking in French] [speaking in French] Picasso? [speaking in French] Merci. [chattering in in French] [speaking in French] Ow! [laughing] ["Hey Ho The Wind and the Rain" by Albert Finney] ♪ When that I was and a little tiny boy ♪ ♪ Hey ho the wind and the rain ♪ ♪ A foolish thing was but a toy ♪ ♪ For the rain it raineth every day ♪ George, I was wondering.. ...if I died, would you marry again? Do not interrupt the maestro while at work. I'm curious. If I die, what would you do? I'd do the decent thing. I'd bury you. ♪ When.. I was only joking. Aww. What's wrong? I don't really think you appreciate me. You know, in France, they call that an American kiss. [theme music] [speaking foreign language] - Pardon? - Actually, I'm from London. Christ. [speaking foreign language] There's a telescope over there with a view of Picasso's villa. Do you wanna give it a shot? The spirit's willing, but the flesh is on California time. Oh, come on. Get those little white legs moving. Jesus Christ. Come on. You're pouting like a little boy. I am not. He's been there for ten minutes. They can bloody well give somebody else a turn. I think he's cute. [clears throat] [speaking foreign language] Hé, mon ballon! Do you see anything? That's it. I think I found it. - Is it the villa? - Yup. - Are you sure? - Yup. How do you know? Because I saw him. [theme music] What a joke. I can't. I travel 9000 miles and right here my nerve fails. Darling, just lift your hand. Go on. Right, now, press the button. What do I do if he answers? "Here we are, talk to us, make us happy." - Just say, Picasso, I love you. - I could say that, yeah. Go on, darling. Go on, monsieur. By all means, ring the bell. Ring it one hundred times, no one will answer, huh? A thousand people ring that bell every month, every year. Silence. Look here. One hundred letters a day! Does he read them? No. How can he? He locks himself away. He paints. Oh, he paints. So, while I stuff the mailbox, wondering why I bother.. ...he paints and while you ring the bell, hmm, he paints, huh? It all comes to the same, eh? Ring away. Mmph. Goodbye, monsieur. Goodbye, madame. He paints. He paints. He paints. [telephone ringing] I guess he's still painting. "Dear, Mr. Picasso." I mean, it doesn't sound right. I don't think there is a Picasso. I think it was bought out years ago by General Motors. You said you saw him. Maybe I only wanted to see him. "Dear, Picasso." I mean, it still doesn't sound right. - What are you doing? - I'm playing. George, if you continue, I won't be able to finish my-- Well, I think Picasso would like the idea. That somebody wrote him a letter while.. [classical music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [dramatic music] [violin music crescendoes] [dog barking] - Come on, I'll be a minute. - Yeah, a minute. I'll be at the art gallery up the street, alright? [male #1] 'But sir, please, I never see the man.' [George] 'There'll be some way you can..' [men chattering] [male #2] 'Believe me, if there was some means to help you, I would.' 'I would like to meet him myself.' Monsieur,what can I say? Well, then give me some information? There's no way? Okay. Merci. Merci. The creations but no creator. - Do you like it? - Yes, nice. I think it's kind of chic and fun and casual. Picassos but no Picasso. You'd think somebody would know him. He must come out sometime. I could wear it like this. No point in staying here if we can't find him. - Let's go to Rome. - Why? It'd be fun. The Sistine Chapel, fettucini alfredo's the Vatican. I'd love to tell everybody I was in Rome and pinched in the Vatican. Maybe we could sneak in and watch the College of Cardinals absolving Galileo. We don't have to go to Rome. I wonder how Picasso would paint the finger of God. Probably like that, hmm? [seagulls squawking] Can't you say anything? George, talk to me. What do you want me to say? It's been a rotten vacation? I know that. We might as well have stayed home for all the difference it's made. Everything's still the same. It was a stupid idea and I'm sorry. I'm not. Really. I'm glad we came. Then you're all alone. [seagulls squawking] [people laughing] I hear they're filming tomorrow. You wanna go? Rudy's in that picture, isn't he? Is he queer, huh? I assure you on that matter I've no inside information whatsoever. [all laugh] Did you know that snails are actually hermaphrodites? He and she, all in one little shell. That's why they don't like to come out. After all, why come out when you got everything you need right in there? You remember when I used to fascinate you with bits of information like that? Yes. It's just like old times, isn't it? [people chattering] As if that made any difference. Well, I'd be queer too if my wife had green skin. - I thought you were queer. - Well, I am. As if I weren't. [all laugh] George. Do you want to go back home? Why? Do you miss something? To me, a French dinner is like a sexual experience. - Really? - And the pastry is the orgasm. [men laugh] Alice, look, after dinner, let's go back to the villa. No, you go. I'm a little tired. [guitar music] [crickets chirping] [music continues] [orchestral music] [people laughing] [men laughing] [people chattering] Um, a beer. [men laughing] [speaking in foreign language] [door opens] [kissing] George? [chuckles] I found him. - 'Found who?' - Picasso. He's outside. Ole. Salvatore Mariano Ortega. [chuckles] [Alice] 'George, where have you been?' He used to work for Dominguin, the bullfighter, on his ranch. I'm sure. He gave me Dominguin's address. Come on, get out of bed. We're going to Dominguin's ranch. I'm not going anywhere. That's the way to get to Picasso, an introduction. - Dominguin is his best friend. - 'George, listen to me.' We can be in Spain this afternoon. Will you sit down and listen to me? He's really quite good when he is sober. This is it. Dominguin's address. Picasso's friend. Oh, will you forget about Picasso? Listen. Will Salvatore Mariano Ortega lie? Sit down. [Alice] 'We're not going anywhere.' It'd be fun. It was fun yesterday like a big detective story let's find Picasso. This is ridiculous. I'm not gonna run off some place because you met a funny.. [Alice] 'Because you met some drunk.' It's alright. He doesn't understand English. Go on, insult my friend. Please take him out of here. He's my friend. Where he goes, I go. - Now, Alice, are you coming? - 'I said, no.' Alright. I shall go alone. If that's what you want. [Alice] 'That's what I want.' Alright, see you someday. [men hollering] [horse neighing] [speaking in foreign language] [rumbling] [men hollering] [chuckling] [chuckling continues] [speaking in foreign language] [laughing] Hey, why you come all this long way to talk to me about Picasso? I want to meet Picasso more than anyone else in the world. And my wife and I flew to France from San Francisco. We went to Mougins at his villa. 'I walked round his villa. I sat on the road' in case he came out of his villa. I wandered on the beach near his villa. I telephoned the villa, no reply. And I've done everything but breakintothe villa. And then I had the idea, as you're such a great friend of Picasso, that maybe if I came here to Spain and met you, you could give me an introduction to him. Well...if you want to know him, you must come into my house. 'And you can see him every place in his work.' [tower bell ringing] [violin music] [music continues] [music continues] [baby wailing] [wailing continues] [church bell ringing] [dog barking] [violin music] [Dominguin] 'There you see..' 'And there.' 'And there.' 'Always the horses, the man, the bulls.' 'One way or another, with oils or water colors..' '...or etchings, and now in clay..' '...Picasso comes back to the arena.' 'Because he is Spanish, and because he cannot' 'come back to Spain..' '...he must come back in his own way.' 'And so, again and again, Picasso returns' 'to the center of life in Spain, which is the bullring.' 'You wish to see Picasso?' 'Then you must enter that arena yourself, and fight a bull.' Do you think, uh, it's absolutely necessary in order to meet Picasso, that I actually fight a bull? - 'Absolutely necessary.' - Fine. Okay.. ...I'll fight a bull. [speaking in foreign language] Well, you do not move. Don't move. Remember. Do not move. Hey, hey! [Dominguin] 'Muy bien.' [George] 'Hey, hey!' [Dominguin] 'Now, very good.' You don't need anything else. I think you must, uh, wait now for the...other bull is coming. - The real bull is coming? - 'Yes.' - Where's it coming from? - 'It's coming from this way.' - From that there? - 'Yes.' Right, I'll leave it to you. I'd like to see-- But this is for you. It's-it's harder with a real bull, isn't it? - 'No, I'm sure you can do it.' - W-with a man, yes. A bull? - Le-let me see you. - 'Well, you see it before.' 'After that, you let me know if you can do it.' - Okay. - Okay? Fine. Let's go. Open the door. [bull grunting] [speaking in foreign language] Toro! Hey! Hey! Muy bueno. [speaking in foreign language] Venga. Venga, venga. Come, come. Come here, come here, by me. And stand still. Stay close to me. Toro.. Toro. Toro! Toro. [speaking in foreign language] '...Toro!' Venga. Venga, venga. Come. And now, with the muleta. - Hey! - 'Stand still.' Don't take your eyes off the bull. Not too much. Touch the bull, right there. Hey! Toro. Hey! [George] 'Hey, Toro!' [Dominguin] 'No, no, no..' 'Pass him..' Now, call the bull, keep forward.. And stand still. Direct him over there. Hey! Hey! [Dominguin] 'Ole! Ole!' [bull grunting] - Hey, Toro! - 'Another one.' - Hey! - 'Another one.' 'Stand still.' 'Another one.' Hey! Hey! 'That's not a very good one.' Mm-mm. [George] 'Hey, Toro.' [Dominguin] 'Ole, ole, muy bien.' 'Now, do another high one.' Hey! - 'Another, another.' - Toro! Toro,hey! Hey! Toro! Hey! [George] 'Hey, Toro.' Muy bueno. [laughing] [bull grunting] [screaming] Keep your head down. Don't move! A-ha, Toro. [bull grunting] Aha, Toro! Hey, hey, senor.. ...look at it. You like to try again? That isn't what he was supposed to do. [Dominguinlaughing] But, do you not feel that in the 20th century bullfighting is a rather archaic way of life? After all, we send men up in rockets who circle the Earth. [speaking in Spanish] [male narrator] The first time I thought of retiring it was a day when I was dressing as a bullfighter. I saw myself, a man ready to kill a beast and I thought that people must, in one way or another help to tell us about death. Sometimes, they do it with poetry or novels.. ...sometimes by a direct confrontation as in the bullring.. ...where people like myself act out our feelings. In the bullfight, instead of waiting for death, we make an appointment to meet it at 4:00 on a Sunday afternoon. And, um, alternately struck blind by the sun or shadowed by the bull, we think, "So that was death" and walk out of the arena more alive into the late day. Picasso likes to walk with me at such times and like a child as with all children, he runs curious after the mystery. He shakes hands with death as it passes. And with that hand which has shaken the hand of the skeleton he snatches the mystery and traps it in oil and canvas. The hoofs of the bull print the sand and this.. ...calligraphy read by the eye of Picasso prints itself to paper. The horn of the bull goring the sand, draws terrible pictures. That horn, Picasso ceases to use for his pen. And so, as the bull sketches out life and death how can Picasso but do the same? In the end, we run to meet life because we cannot wait for it to happen to us. We must make it happen. [flamenco guitar music] [feet tapping] [music continues] [feet tapping] [music continues] [castanet clapping] [feet tapping] [tempo increasing] [music stops] [music commences] [instrumental music] [music continues] [drum roll] [trumpet music] [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] [flamenco guitar music] [castanet clapping] [guitar music] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] [Spanish trumpet music] [crowd shouting] [music continues] [church bell tolling] [speaking in Spanish] [speaking in French] I'm sorry, I didn't mean to intrude. - Ooh, you're English. - American. Ah, American eh? Oh, well, join us anyway. [chuckles] We are both shocked, eh? You because I am blind, and me...because you are the first tourist who hasn't snapped my picture. [chuckles] It's lovely. Ah...the advantage of not seeing, mademoiselle. You know, I can still paint the sun long after it has set. - Ah, well, enough for today. - Yes. Merci. You know, mademoiselle.. ...I hate to finish a picture. I put it off as long as possible. To me, it's like killing it. No...the joy is in doing it. Not finishing it. We come back tomorrow. Well, goodbye. I must go. Goodbye? But-but you're coming home to dinner with us. - Well, I-- - You have plans? - No, not exactly. - Well.. Oh, yes, please, mademoiselle. Well, thank you. I will. - No. - Yes, yes, yes. Merci, merci. And, and do you know what he did there? He gave all that up to become an artist. My husband wanted to become an artist once. What does your husband do in America? - He's an architect. - Then he is an artist. Hmm...I suppose you could say so. I'm afraid he doesn't think of himself as one though. You know, independent, working alone, like that. He thinks of himself rather as a cog in a big machine. That's why he admires Picasso so much. Oh, Picasso. You know, I don't always understand his paintings. I know...but can you understand when a bird sings? [female speaking in Spanish] No, miss. And your children, are they here with you? We don't have any children, yet. And your husband admires Picasso? 'Oh, and even when I could see, I never knew' 'when I started a painting, what would come out.' 'So being blind is no handicap in that way.' Ooh, it's still a struggle. A great adventure. At the end...a mystery. This, I did many years ago when I could see. 'You know, it's funny.' 'But I know I am better now.' As Picasso once said.. ...first, I eat the fruit, then, I paint it. 'So really, it's th-the same for me.' Yes. And, if I want to see the old way.. ...I have my wife. You know, I could paint Notre Dame.. ...if she were there to tell me how many saints there were on the west-front. Which way in the sun, and which way in the shade. I would love to have some of your paintings. - Would you sell me one? - Oh, which would you like? - This one. - Eh? The one you did today. Oh...but it is not finished. Well, finishing it is like killing it. Here...here I give it to you. Oh, no no no. I wanted to pay for it. It is a small gift. Tomorrow, I start another one. And remember.. ...the joy is in doing it. Please, accept it. [instrumental music] [music continues] Hello. Hello. May I join you? Well, I was expecting someone, but, uh.. ...if you wish. - Tired? - Yeah, a little. Me, too. - Did you find Picasso? - Nope. He tried, Dominguin tried. But he couldn't reach him. - We have to go home today. - I know. I missed ya. [waves crashing] Do you like it? Well, I mean, it's not finished. But when it's finished-- Well, it's not exactly a Picasso, is it? But it's very, very good. It's going to be a beautiful day. You want to go for one last swim before we leave? Yes. [instrumental music] So what could I do? All the bulls running around I jumped into the river. [Alice giggles] Then he pulled me out with this...stick they use for prodding the bulls when they herd them. [Alice giggles] After that, all he could do was invite me to his place to dry me out, right? I wish I'd been there with you. If you had, he would've left me in the river. [chuckles] See, the objective is to let the bull pass as closely as possible to your body. Feel quite nervous actually when you-you're waiting there and for the...bull to charge towards you. 'And you see the look in its eyes' 'as it's deciding what its target is to be..' [voice fades] [orchestral music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues]
