Therefore, all of the characters and incidents are fiction. Yoshio Marukido, the defendant in this case... raped or raped and murdered 47 women in total and is an atrocious sexual predator. What’s more, 11 of his female victims were strangled by him just because... he got angry after his rape attempts failed. That’s not true. I didn’t kill them. That’s not true! The defendant stored the dead bodies of those 11 women, slept with them... and yet he still insists that he didn’t kill them. It wasn't me. I didn’t kill them! It wasn't me. Yoshie… Miss! What are you doing? Is there anyone there? Help me! Please wait! What are you doing? Let me go! Let me go! Please wait! Is there anyone there? Anyone? I told you to let me go! Let me go! Anyone? Help me! Let me go! No! Stop! Yoshie… What the hell are you doing? Let me go! You idiot! No! Anyone? Help me! What's wrong? Wake up! The defendant keeps insisting that he didn’t kill them... and that there was an accomplice. However, the traces left on the dead bodies and the semen inside them... are all from one person. They indisputably belong to the defendant, Yoshio Marukido. Had there been an accomplice, there would be evidence supporting that fact. However, there is none at all. Well... We are here. So, who is the accomplice he keeps talking about? If the accomplice ever existed, we have to find that person. It is the key to solving this case. Well... I'm back. It’s alright now. Alright... Let me clean you up. You are pretty now. What’s with you? Are you jealous? Huh? How cute. You don’t have to be jealous. How cute. Yoshie, let me adore you. You are such a good girl… - Mister! Help me! - What’s up, bitch? Why did you run? This is not what you promised me! - Shut up, idiot! - Step aside! No! It won’t take long! Just be a good girl. I don’t want to! Let me go! Get in! Let me go! No! You're naughty. No! Calm down! Let me go! We are paying you! I don’t want to! This is not what you promised me! What are you looking at? Get out! But she wants me to help her… Whores do what whores are supposed to do! There is nothing strange about this! We are paying her! This is not what you promised me! The two of you? I am not a prostitute! - Stop lying! - Let me go! Stop looking and get out! Be a good girl. No! Not yet? - Why does it take so long? - Try it yourself. Money… Did you really get it? I'm poor. I have no other choice. This woman has no class either. What? Do it! Do it! Do it right! No! No! What the hell? No! No! No... Let me go! No! No! No! Let me go! No! Hey, what happened? Hey! Wake up! She's dead… Did I really kill them? I don’t remember anything… Out of the way! Out of the way, asshole! Hey! I heard the rumors! You messed it up again! That was your fourth time of losing your mind in front of people, right? I think you only lose your mind in front of girls, don’t you? It must be so hard to live with those urges. - But he is still young. - I agree. Waves… Waves… Waves… Hey! We need to talk. Follow us. - Where are we going? - Don’t worry. Apparently, you work as a janitor for the fishermen’s office. You live in the cave. Yes. Yuko ran away, but it’s not our fault, right? How should I know? If you tell others about the incident, people will suspect us. Also, I think living alone in a cave is dangerous. Are you threatening me? Not exactly… We just don’t want people to know about our relationship with Yuko. People might misunderstand the situation. If you tell anyone, there will be consequences. Got that, asshole? I understand. Then keep your mouth shut! Don’t you dare tell anyone! I will break your balls! Don’t tell anyone! Understood? Thank God… You have been good girls while waiting for me, right? Thank God… Wait… What if they find out… My… My precious treasure… They can't have it! Shit! I will never let those bastards touch them! I will never let anyone see you. I will never let anyone see you. You're clever! Bastard! Do you think you did it alone? Bastard, who are you? Do I have to introduce myself? I am always with you, especially when important things happen. Show yourself! Calm down. I'm inside your head, so I can't come out. Shit! I'm inside your heart too. Murderer… You did it, didn’t you? You killed all those girls! Well, really? You wanted to kill them too, didn’t you? I only helped you a little. Show yourself! Shit! Please… I beg you… Please tell me! I beg you! Please tell me! Hey! Why do you kill people? Why do you kill women? I don’t know. People always pretend to forget about that. Keep that in mind from now on. Bye. Hey! Hey! Hey! How about Ken? How about Ken? Ken? He's dead. Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken! Alright... Do it! Do it! Do it! Now or never! Alright! If you really want to die, let me kill you. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Do people always pretend to forget about that? Why should it be that way? What did I do wrong then? Hey! Show yourself! Show yourself and answer me! So what? I'm always like this. You'll just keep watching? Bastard! Stop! Stop! No! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! No! No! Stop! No! No! No! No! Stop! No! No! No! Stop! No! No! No! No! No! How was it? Do you get it now? I have been with you ever since the incident. I never left you, not even for a second. The incident? I mean your very first murder! I see… Did I really do it? Bastard! How dare you! It hurts… I know everyone has the right to choose their partner... but I can’t allow Yoshie to marry a low-life like you! If you still have something to say, get a proper job and come back! - But Yoshie and I are already… - Shut up! Get out now! How dare you! Bastard… Listen! If I see your face in this neighborhood again, there will be consequences! Don’t ever forget! I have no choice… Yoshie! Yoshie! Yoshie! Yoshie! It’s me! Yoshie! It’s me! Yoshio… What if father sees you? This way. He is that kind of person. I will persuade him little by little. It’s not about that. I can elope with you. Let’s run away now. But we have nowhere to go. How would we survive? That’s not important! This is not good! This is about our happiness! Yoshie… Please run away with me! Yoshie… Yoshio! Yoshio! Yoshie… No… I can’t do it here. - Yoshie… - No! Let me go. Please let me go. Wait. Yoshie… You will run away with me, right? Yoshie! Yoshie! Yoshie! Bastard! How dare you! - Bastard! Bastard! - Father! Father! I am sorry! Bastard! Who do you think I am? Bastard! - You bastard! - Father! Father! Please let him go! Stop! Stop! Father! Please! Father! I am sorry! - Bastard! - It’s my fault! - Let him go! Father! - Yoshie! It’s also your fault! You have been naughty! How dare you do this to your parents? Shame on you! How dare you? You bitch! Shame on you! How dare you do this to your parents? Yoshie… Yoshie! Murderer! Murderer! Yoshie! - Murderer! - Please don’t leave me! Yoshie! Yoshie… Yoshie… Yoshie… Yoshie… And then I left Hokkaido. I disappeared completely. I deserve this. We need to talk after you're done. Come to the embankment in the back. I don’t have to explain, do I? She was Kazuo’s girl. She told me everything. I thought you were a virgin. Apparently, it’s the opposite. I can see now you are not a virgin. I heard you raped her. She needs money for that. I don’t have money. You don’t have to pay today. Just bring it tomorrow afternoon. 50,000. 50,000? No way! If she is pregnant, she has to get an abortion and rest for several days. She will also have to make excuses about taking a business trip to Tokyo. You have to pay damages for her mental suffering too. We can’t just let this go. I know this kind of thing happens sometimes. I will think about it. This is my first time asking for an advance. Okay, it’s done. I'll see you tomorrow. You can give me an answer then. Let’s go. Let’s go. Do I have to run away again? Yoshie… Yoshie! Yoshie! What are you doing? - I didn’t mean to kill you. - You got the wrong person! - Stop! - Yoshie! Help me! - Please don’t leave me! - Stop! - Yoshie! - Please help me! Stop! Yoshie! I love you! - Stop! Help me! - I didn’t mean to kill you. Yoshie! Please don’t leave me! Stop! - Yoshie! - Stop! No! Stop! No! No! - Yoshie! Yoshie! - Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! No! No! Yoshie! Yoshie! I didn’t mean to kill you. Yoshie! She is dead. I shouldn’t have been attracted to girls in the first place. Girls are all the same. Yoshie is not so different from these girls. Shit! I don’t care anymore. Tanuki – Yakitori Bar What did I run from? Murderer? Fine. I will never run away again. Shit! Hey! I'm not scared of anything anymore! I can do anything! I'm not scared of anything! Anything! How dare you ridicule me! Hey! I'm not scared of anything anymore! I can do anything! Shit! Hey! Hey! You should thank your master! You should thank your master… Wake up! Hey, everyone! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! This is my true face! My era has just begun! What's up? Huh? What's with you? Do you want to drink? Then drink! Here. You too? You want some too? Fine. I heard you. I heard you. You can drink some too. You can have anything you want. I know! You like it, don’t you? Good! Not this… You were a virgin too. Minors are not supposed to drink alcohol! Got it? I only kissed you… Alright! The last one over there! Here! Drink some! Hey! Wake up! Drink some! Hey! Alright! I'm going to sleep! Alright! Good night, everyone! You go sleep too! Hey! I think you don’t need me anymore. I mean, you became a real murderer. Many things have happened. It was difficult to understand sometimes... but the girls were all mine in the first place. Mister! Hey, Mister! - What happened to the 50,000 yen? - Damages! Damages! You touched my friend’s girl, you bastard! How dare you! Bastard! I'll beat you to death! - It hurts. - Give me my money! You retard! - Idiot! - It hurts. Retard! Shit! Listen! We'll get it from the cave you live in! Got it? Idiots! You'll understand soon enough! Don’t be shocked! - Are you sure we can go in? - It's fine! - Let’s go. - Yes. It’s really dark. What is this… Oh! There! I think the accomplice the defendant, Yoshio Marukido... keeps talking about is the voice of his own heart. We found the women’s bodies in the cave... with the help of the directions the witnesses provided. However, we couldn’t find any trace of an accomplice. If an accomplice ever existed… Inside this cave! Alright! Ready? I don't think he has any weapons. However, you should be careful not to provoke him. Okay? Are you really going in? Be quiet! - Kimio! - Kimi! - Kimio… - Who the hell is she? She is our friend. - Take her outside right now! - Yes. Kimio! Follow me. - Damn! - What have you been doing? Hey! I did it with someone else. I killed them with someone else. The defendant might be crazy. He keeps insisting he had an accomplice... and that he doesn’t remember anything about his crimes. However, the defendant admits his crimes... and is calmly awaiting the moment when he can finally atone for them. This is the cave where you used to live. Thank you very much. - I’ve missed it. - Listen. Yes? The important thing is to make him remember the times he committed his crimes. He might confess after seeing the place where the dead bodies were stored. Yes, I will try my best to achieve that. I'm back! I'm back, everyone! Are you okay? Are you okay, everyone? I see. I see… You have been good girls while waiting for me, haven’t you? Hey! Are you okay? Hey! Are you okay? I see. I see… How nice of you… This doesn’t work… Are you okay too? I see… I see. I see. You have been good girls while waiting for me, haven’t you? Prosecutor! Thank you very much! Thank you very much! This here is my only… Thank you very much. Thank you very much! - Let’s go. - Yes. - Hey! - Yes. I have nothing more to say. He killed 11 women. However, I couldn’t find out anything about them from the defendant. We had to admit that he didn’t have any intent for the crimes. They say ‘Hate the crime, not the criminal’. Was this rare kind of evil rapist in Japanese criminal history actually a kind-hearted guy? Or do people have to admit that everyone has that kind of urge in their heart? Despite the fact that I am seeking the death penalty for him... I am not interested in seeing him hang in person. The End
