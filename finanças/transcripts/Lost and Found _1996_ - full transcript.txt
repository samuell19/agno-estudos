Running scares Your scooter? Yes, my place is nearby Rule no.1: time control Every moment lost increases the searching perimeter Come to my office now and fill me in Time is running out Worm believes he's the only one who'd search with a vengeance All because he's professional Almost like a psychiatrist who got paid to save other people's pain Since losing something can be as painful as anything Good to see you here.

First, we must know how to be selective You've left out blank Reason for the search Personal reason Well... It would help if you could tell me I didn't intend to keep any secret... On the contrary I felt a big secret was going around And nobody wanted to let me in In fact, to search for this secret we must go back earlier I thought you're 21 How old are you, Uncle Tong? Remember we have the same birthday? You delivered me on your 40th birthday Remember? Lam It's better for you to get a second opinion You tell her, daddy! You don't trust your own diagnosis?

I'll give you 5 minutes I graduated at the New York University last year I'm a fine arts major minor in psychology I'm not sure who's more stubborn my dad or me I wanted to work in this shipping company He wanted to interview me... I agreed! I'd never thought of inheriting his business I wasn't even in the line I want to work in this company... simply because I love the sea As for my health here's my medical report It's just confirmed that I have leukemia A 30% chance of recovery I'm sure this is not an issue on my working ability I didn't mean to embarrass him I only wanted to pick a situation where neither of us can cry out The driving range of Discovery Bay is quite good A bit windy But it's okay I've bought some new irons I was there... yes, handicap 3 It's going to take days, this dripping Yes! The dose at one go would be too much to take It has to drip in slowly And that's only one of several doses I'm sorry Just take this as a short vacation I want to throw up already It won't act up so quickly stop imagining She'll be nauseous too? Yes Be good now, I know it's painful Just be patient Excuse me I'm sorry Uncle Tong Why are you getting off? To go to work You don't work here I just needed to pick up something okay? This is your office, Miss Chai I discovered that shipping has nothing to do with sea-loving I know nothing about shipping More sadly I know nothing about the sea I had this recurring nightmare I was repeatedly rushing onto nowhere in the city and I just couldn't stop I had this urge to crash through anything My mom struggled against cancer for 4 years I'm sure I don't have her courage I hope for an almighty magician... to make my illness disappear That was the second time I saw Ted I couldn't start to describe him Yee. You walk too fast Don't you feel the beat? I'm telling you, you can sing Teddy wants to sign you You know my family won't like it I won't pitch you against your dad But it is different now I can't say I know how you suffer all these pain I only know if you can't change the fact Why not got out with a bang! I might not be your best friend But I'm the one with most fun, right? Stick with me for some laughs at least I've changed the key, should be right now That's what you said every time Lone, what a surprise I've just thought of something I must tell you Now? What? I said let's get married How's everything? I'm leaving What's the matter? He wants us to get married now Sounds reasonable Don't you plan to anyway? With him by your side it would give you strength, right? I don't think so either Please sign here, Miss Chai Okay The boss's daughter's here, go ask her You can't lay-off us without proper notice No compensation and no overtime payment? Yes, at least let us present our case It's out of hand here, call the police Is that right? Call the police? Let's show them some muscles Calm down now. Stop it right here Calm down. She's a girl What happens? She'll be fine Just get some rest Thank you Dad? She's alright now No need to go to hospital How are you? Hi! How are you doing? Thank you No problem As long as I've got a chance to hold you I'm happy I've got something for you I go get it you wait here Can I come on board? Of course, it's your father's ship This is the bridge There's no girl sailor, right? I haven't seen one Come to think of it, there are none I knew it, traditionally... ...no women ever inherit a shipping business either Don't know cargo ships are so modified and clean You think sleep 30 men in one room put them all in hammocks? Yes, and there are slaves locked up in the galley Sit in rows and rowing long cars An one-eyed captain with a wooden leg with a parrot on the shoulder Maybe in my grandfather's time Your grandfather? Yes This is my cabin, I'll fetch for you Can I take a look? Sure Your shoe Thanks Your grandfather's sailor too? Yeah, you want a coke? Where did you come from? Here The edge of the world The edge of the world? The edge of the world You see! My grandfather told me, our ancestors they were Vikings The Vikings from Scandinavia? Yes You see long time ago They were sailing They came to the place call the edge of the world And they settle there Is this the place? Yeah! That's a picture of it That's where my grandfather was born And just like the others they went to Scotland to find work So after that they all became Scotsman My mother she's Chinese They're back, I have to make dinner Make dinner? Yeah, I'm the chef Really? Really! You want to stay here for dinner? I'd better not, maybe next time I should treat you dinner sometime I'll let you make your dinner It's alright When's the ship leaving? In a few days Okay, bye bye Bye! Be careful Waiting for someone, Miss Chai? Yes That's all I can find Take a look Is that all? So heavy, you owe me a favour Okay. Let me have look first Hi, Kelly Hi How are you? Fine, thank you These are the books that you asked for Okay And this book you'll be particularly interested Where's my pay? In day or two That's what you said last time I'll come back tomorrow It'll sail out in 3 days We have to put in some O. T And we are short of labour It is going to be difficult But the money always talk We must decide earlier though We need some time to recruit new labour Okay I'm sorry, Bill You have to come all the way from downtown It's okay I've heard of the edge of the world It's somewhere here supposing But better yet I have someone who knows these water well I've asked him to come along And he is here already Ted, this is Miss Chai Hi Pleasure You must curious to know why You are the one who's curious What do you want to know? I've read a book about this island... An island has a lot of graveyards? Yes my home island has a lot of graveyards Really? Is it the edge of the world? Go on There are only few people left all old people too And they have lesser and lesser means to survive Yeah! You see all the younger generations' gone They only have two reasons why they go back One is to bring the deceased back to be buried and the other is to bring you back to be buried All the tombstone face the ocean All slandering towards the sky Why? They are dead and they still want to leave? It's the edge of the world where else can they leave for? Doesn't matter whether you're staying or leaving Home is always home Nobody will forget their homes This is a picture of my grandfather They're in Scotland There is a day in every year When the cold front from the ocean meets the warm front from England And on this day they all come to the cliff to let the warm current to bring their hearts home That's what you to know? I thought you want to know more about me Yes, I want to know about you So I want to know the place you from Now you're not so sure You shouldn't think so much about death Thank you Dad is right He worries about your health he's not saying you can't handle the work This is nothing job to start with anyway If that's how you think of dad you don't understand his point of view My days at the dock were over I wasn't supposed to go back Ted's ship is gone But Ted isn't on board at all He hasn't left any contact Eventually, even my trustworthy doctor Uncle Tong couldn't treat me anymore He retired after a heart attack I'm not going to be as kind as Dr. Tong My patient has to absolutely discipline These medicine are a little different They are pills, no painful injections But would they act up like those injections? I'll still be nauseous and... losing my hair? Of course, that's the price you have to pay to get well Sorry! No bus, take taxi Bingo! I haven't told him who am I and why I should find Ted What's this place? Sailor's home Sailor's home? Yes You are a kindergarten teacher Me? Do I look like one? You're wrong! I though you only need to know why I search for this guy Now you want to know about me? That was the first time I saw May but she treated me like an old friend and it doesn't seem out of turn either Then Worm said she's friendly to her customers too May draws an in-and-out chart of all vessels in the harbour everyday Worm said next to the Marine Department she's the most knowledgeable of the local maritime activities No, thanks So you like the sea? So you like the sea? Yes, I like the sea Yes, I like the sea Worm asked May where most sailors stay recently May asked us to take her down the pier There used to be big ships and war ships all over Please, hurry Be patient The Salvation Army Hotel off the market The Y.M.C.A. on the Ladder Street The Moon Flower Inn at spring Breeze Lane Worm said May was a bit lunatic But I said those who loves the sea couldn't be too crazy Let's call it a night Why? I'll pay you over time Not just that It's so late now If he's gone, he's gone If not, he'll be sleeping somewhere You haven't told me the reason yet I know you're dancer What makes you think that? Sailor and dancer, it just gels It gels Here's the change Thanks Check it Why not stay longer? The ship is leaving Can I leave my luggage here? I'll come back for it Thanks You can check the register list I only come from holiday tonight I couldn't have seen him anyway Can we check your guest list of the past few days? They are locked in the office And everyone's off now If nothing on the list he might have checked out already This is the last on my list See, this must be a first time customer I bet he rarely eat out too Doesn't even know the best dish here This guy probably just have a fight with his wife He's mixing up all the hot sauces What a mess! Not enjoying either You look prettier every time Go on and order anything My auntie owns this place Why so funny? The wig looks like a bird nest You shouldn't laugh One time a guy offered me $10,000 to find his wig I said a new one only costs a couple of thousand He said it would never be the same I found his wig I'd never seen a happier person Then I realized, a wig is not just a wig it's his whole self-esteem I grew up on the Mongolian steppe Sometimes you could hardly see anyone else Here, there are millions of people and millions different stories Only now I realize that Worm is basically a lonely person Lose & found is an excuse for him to reach out and touch the world I know who you are Stop this silly guessing game of yours please! Don't try to fit me into... one of your million stories I wasn't sensitive enough then... to embrace his idiosyncrasies... or anyone else's Now what? we must expand the perimeter Fresh salmon from Scotland Want to try some? Hotels You mean everyone in the book? Needle in a haystack, right? For sure, there are millions of people in the city... start from where? I want to ask you what's your success rate? Depends on what to be found Average, in general 10 to 20 percent That's always unsuccessful But the point is nothing's guaranteed but trying to keep the hope live You're either too native Or you're only cheating your clients Nothing is lost forever! What's this word? Scotland We're in business again Let's go Could be him: 6ft, sort of a beard A foreigner's face It must be him How long has he gone? you've just missed him He said he's heading to the airport Thanks Come back get on Down there Him?

Where's your sister? Jane's taking care of her Go now See you See you Your grand-daughter? Oh! No! My grand-daughter's in high school now She just helps me out here Hasn't she got a home? What a sad story to these sisters Their mom ran away their dad's never home So I sort of them here at the stall... And take care of their meals everyday Jane baby-sits the young one upstairs while the older one is at school Hi! Little baby You even don't take care of your own siblings But you do that for others! What kind of job is this? And the pay is ridiculous Morning little baby I'm sorry, I'm in your way It's okay Morning Join us for breakfast? Okay You look so pale I'm okay Some food will do you good Freshly cooked Thank you Morning baby She won't answer you We don't talk, do we? Why she couldn't talk? When she was one, her mom ran off She spoke only one word Mom Now she refuses to speak at all Not to me, not anyone Here's your breakfast What's the medicine for look so serious! Asthma, really serious How's your foot? It has swollen up this morning I'm so sorry. All because of me Don't worry Here's $3,000, thanks Hello, you'll search for anything won't you? Sure, what are you searching for? Red-beak duck You hurt your foot because of me I should return a favour We do hire part-time worker But only on commission not very good money I have time anyway, commission, so be it How much do you think is in that piggy bank? Stop it Watch out, my boss is a mean guy He hires us handicaps because we work for peanuts Greedy merchant Alright, you might as well go see what she's up to Ting Ting took me to a rose garden that roses never grow Miss Chai Yes Thanks for taking care of her Daddy has to stay with mommy at the hospital for a few nights Auntie Chiu next door will look after you And she'll cook for you, okay? Okay Bye Bye You mustn't lie again, okay? Just this once. Can't let him know Ting's parents grew plants for city hall... One day, her mommy asked her daddy From when we met and married; to the birth and growth of our daughter how come you never send me flowers? Daddy answered I've never thought of it since we're around flowers everyday Next day mommy received a bunch of roses from daddy and was elated From then daddy sent mommy roses everyday Mommy was happy But frowned on the money spent Then daddy decided to plant a rose garden for his wife But for a year, not even a single flower Then the wife had to check into hospital due to kidney failure I know dad wishes the rose will blossom Mom will be happy seeing roses If she feels happy, she will recover Dad said mommy needed a big operation She might not be able to see the flower bloom This used to be a vegetable garden One season, winter melons came out... twice the usual size Ting's daddy explained there were passing wild ducks They passed by and fertilized the field So, those winter melons grew bigger Ting Ting believed if the red-beak ducks would just return... Roses would blossom in the rose garden You've actually promised her? Yes, you are the one who said "Nothing is lost forever" But who says... Needle in the haystack That I'm too naive Or I'm hustling the clients Not a good proposition Of course not Those flat-beak ducks are wild ducks Where to fetch them and how? It's red-beak duck not flat-beak duck Say we can locate the duck How are we going to fly them there? And the roses, will they then bloom? And the mother, will she recover? The odds are far too long I would not look at it this way If her mother is to die the child has to face the sad truth even 10-year-old kids or not But in this 10-year-old mind the only hope is... ...to search for those flat-beak ducks If she doesn't try to realize this hope she will blame herself later That's why she comes all this way to us Even if we fail to find the ducks At least she will have a peace mind Hey, the rose garden is actually close to the wild-life reservation area This soil isn't really perfect for roses It may still do... at least the branches seem healthy What about these duck? Animal droppings can be nourishing for sure In France, they use cow dung sometimes But red-beak duck is out of my league Let me do some tests on these soil samples first, okay? Take your medicine first I'll take you to the movie later Look who's talking! You yourself haven't been to a movie before It's beautiful, you drew this too? Know what, that little girl could well be a child prodigy Really? How do you know? Just guess After some serious studies Worm figures using live fish-bait to lure the ducks Look at that silly guy, he's having fun Thank to you Why? You know, the things we're hired to find Wallets, pets... And mobile phones the most requested, so boring! Here we are trees and land under the big sky Searching for... How should I say... Something of life-saving vitality I don't mean to be corny When Worm first came he didn't speak the language didn't know a soul He drove a cab but couldn't recognized direction always got into troubles I told him to go back to Mongolia and raise horses instead Since he's such a wide-eyed pony himself You have read our service item list right? "Sending a search team to all possible locations for thorough searching" Or "Worldwide skyline internet round-chase" Sound more like a spy movie But this is something else really... thank to you I'm not sure if this formula going to work or not I'll double the dose If it works, it works superbly You walk so fast Can't you feel the beat? What beat? You really want me to sing? Okay The sun will rise again... Looking out for paradise What to be in paradise Looking out for paradise The hides behind cloudy sky Searching for a paradise But paradise in disguise Running out of space to find All but for some peace of mind Somewhere birds are flying Where the sun will shine in this morning Things that touch my heart string Will soon be here awaiting Suddenly! I realize Never mind where's paradise Hope is always by your side Paradise is where love lies Is Judy there please? Judy, this is Lam I'd like to postpone my flight to Scotland For a week May 28, Okay! Via Holland, Okay, thanks! Let's go upstairs Somewhere birds are flying Where the sun will shine in the morning Things that touch my heart string Will soon be here awaiting Suddenly I realize Never mind where's paradise Hope is always by your side Paradise is where love lives Why staring at me Just lucky Really, pure luck Yes, just lucky He wouldn't know it But in my mind, he's the magician The guy... is crazy! We only promised the kid to find those ducks Mission impossible is accomplished You think the flowers will make her mom recover? That's the logic of a ten-year-old girl Look, anything is possible now A week ago, we're ignorant of duck of any beak Red-beak! To be precise Who would have thought we are experts on flat-beak duck Now, we know their habitat we know their feeding habit There're something called transplant in gardening Keung, the florist, told me He'll be coming with me He'll bring the flowers on a discount in gardening Really? Count me in Why don't you just stick in the flowers? It's cheating anyway If there's one line of hope to save a life What does it matter, cheating or not? Just like you lie to Chu? Who's Chu? The guy who's looking for his wife the guy who sells congee He's gone nuts Crazy! They said I was crazy then when I opened up this business So, you're not coming? I'll just go with Kueng Crazy... Look like there are buds on each branch Really? Really? Seems like, but I'm not too sure So are there buds or not? Aren't you an expert? Listen I'm only a florist, not a gardener Everything I sell are blossoming already When can we be sure? In the morning When we can see more clearly? Come back in the morning We're here, let's wait in the van and keep checking Now you're really crazy It'll be a long night I'd rather sleep in a bed I'll take the bus back to town You're coming, Ming? I'd like to stay But more chance for a miracle if they are left alone You need this more You're not leaving? You take this I'll take a look again You took a look 15 mins ago. Too soon! The buds don't seem to grow at all How would you notice when you check every 10 mins! Right! You haven't said anything about yourself yet I'm not going to guess anymore Speak up! I have a question for you first Okay! How do you lie to Mr. Chu he who's lost his wife? Actually we've found his wife She's dead We dare not tell him yet I'm quite sure Chu is the suicidal kind If he killed himself that wouldn't be the end of it He has four kids... that need to be fed, to go to school That's why you urge him to work harder and save up more money We're going tell him the truth sooner or later Sooner or later I'll go check the buds anyway Okay Why didn't you wake me up? You were sound asleep Oh great! Oh, Joe's formula works They're going to operate on Ting's mom It would forever be a mystery that it was Joe's formula or the ducks' droppings that worked... or the flowers themselves were supposed to bloom anyway? Never mind! Stop that They're going to operate on Ting's mom Her father took Ting to the hospital two nights ago to stay with her mom The words are her mom is not going to make it I'm not sure what we have done For the little girl, for her mother or just satisfy ourselves 3 days later, Ting Ting called and... said her mom had gone she thanked us anyway... Her daddy wanted to put the roses in the funeral... But the father and daughter decided... to leave the roses where they were... That day, the sun shone glamorously... the roses must be so beautiful Give this back to her please Mr. Worm I've saved up $50,000 We can start doing that... sending a search team to all possible locations for thorough searching Have you found what you lost? I want to tell him his wife is dead Which is more cruel the truth or the lie? If you were to die should you keep it from someone you care about? The thing for you to do is to make money And take care of your kids send them to school I'm doing all that now The stairs are steep and smelly What a garbage dump this is? Only my stupid daughter fell into your trap You blood-suckers! Aren't you off yet, Jane? Just a few more calls to make But this is Saturday And they're not paid for that I'm not going to wait for you I'm coming Hurry up! I don't have a life time to wait for you You've lost weight again watch your diet You'll get sick for not eating properly understand? You should follow my advice more! I'll help you. Let me give you a hand No need... I can manage, Miss, thanks Are you sure? I'm used to it, I do it everyday Let me help I'm fine Be careful! Stay home! Don't show up again Fat chance, scum! Everyday, she carries Jane for blocks Coming to work and back delivers her lunch Never needing our help I must go, I'm sorry At that moment I decided that There were no magic and no magicians in the world Little sister is lost! I've searched through the neighbourhood no sign of her How far can a 3 years old go? There're a lot of child kidnapping lately Any particulars about her? Asthma Oh! Yes! Has she taken her medicine yet? No Sir The kid has serious asthma It could be fatal But I'm only have to gather information I'm not in charge Let me call up headquarters Thank you It's been almost 4 hours She couldn't have disappeared on her own Must find her I'll try that restaurant What's on a 3-year-old mind? I'll be genius it I knew Not there What are you looking at? This looks familiar, isn't it? A child prodigy Let's go Have you seen a little girl this tall? No...! This tall Get your tickets! I'll get it I look over there Lam has awoken It has turned to be serious anemia The count of platelet is also low You must have dumped my medicine She must discipline herself A doctor can only do so much I'd like to keep her here Maybe for a month I never thought my father cared... until my brother told me something while I was in hospital Dad! How's it? Is she okay? She's fine, she could continue her work That Worm came over here twice last night and once this morning He knows... who you are and your illness He seems to care very much With a lot of compassion, I'll say Doctor Chan Yes I'll like to talk with you alone please Dr. Chan I know you're a straight-forward person What's the odds now? It has worsened. To say the least... that's always a chance, though slim Okay It's also up to you and your will power and you must follow my prescription That Warm Mr. Worm Excuse me, I'm not Mr. Worm That Worm, just That Worm Okay... As much as I've been informed Lam's been hanging around with you And... thank you Let's go see Lam Okay She didn't utter one word Don't even look my way At least, I know who you are And I thought I was observant I am so stupid I'm not even qualified to handle any lost and found work Maybe you're right I'm too naive And to look for what's lost in such tremendous world is indeed like looking for a needle in a haystack But you know me As long as one looks, there's still hope Otherwise, it's hopeless Which is more cruel to leave him cold now? I dare not whisper a word I dare not whisper a word nor to take one glance at him or I might not be able to persist with my decision Where are you going? I'm in a hurry Wait for me Michelle, come on Our bread and butter is here, come on Can you please picture him and me? Thank you My grandfather and she were partners She's our housekeeper's daughter I just do it to help her to make a little money from the tourist Are you alright? I'm fine Look at this This is one of the best salmon rivers in Scotland Beautiful, isn't it? Really beautiful Do you know how I located you back then? Of course! A Mr. Lost & Found Because of salmon, salmon from Scotland Really? Yes Then, Ted said something that touched my wounded heart he says nature is fascinating... Those on the top may return to the sea and what's in the sea might return to the mountain...

I'm okay Then I remember Worm's words One can never be presumptions... Ted said living here on one hand we have to fight with the nature We should follow the law of nature on the other Who would have noticed under such unfavourable conditions traces of life still oozing in their terms The edge of the world over there?
