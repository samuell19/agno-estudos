Are they. Remember, aim high, we want to catch them alive. Look at this tape. They saw us and said, "Let's go get them." - I did not understand. - It must be serious. I've never seen so many tapes. They are all over the country. Should we continue to run away from them? - Let's find out on Fork River. - Fork River? It is a ghost town, no one lives there. Marshal Clark is waiting for me there. I think it is very important. He wouldn't have asked us to keep it a secret. I don't care, but I don't like to be expelled without answering. It's not fun. You're right, Fuzzy. Moving on, we should reach Fork River tonight. Yes, with luck. Fuzzy, I don't like that. How about covering your back when I enter? - Cover your back, why... - Fuzzy. Go from the back. OK. - Do you have any fire? - I do not smoke. - Do you have any fire? - I think so. - Where do you think you're going? - I'm going to go through that door. Wait, Lash. So, Mr. Cordova, what do you think of this man? Oh damn. He's a great fighter. Hello, Marshal It is good to see you again. I'm a little confused. What is happening ? You see, Lash, I told Mr. Cordova that you were the man capable of doing this job. I had to put up obstacles to prove it. Where's your partner, Fuzzy Jones? Hello, Marshal. Hey... is that one of your obstacles? I see that you are not at risk. What impressed me? A cyclone? Lash, this is Deputy Marshal Cal Saunders. Nice to meet you. Sorry if I was a little brutal. I'm glad that you're on our side. What is all this? I did not understand. We are trying to capture a lot of counterfeiters who have been operating on the border for months. So far, we have been unlucky. Yes, the marshal is right. We believe that they captured an American recorder, Frank Evans. They may have already killed you. Do you know where they work from? Mr. Cordova believes that they are working in a village across the border. The place is a refuge for the renegades of the territory. It is headed by a man named Jim McCord. - You can't do anything? - Nothing by law. This land is privately owned. It is sovereign territory. Exact... If Cordova's men go, they will break the law. My men would also break the law. It looks serious to me. That's why we need you, Lash. A man who knows how to make the law reign. We accept the job. Do you know who else could work with this gang? The only information I have, comes from an old research poster Lash, that must interest you. That explains why they were after me. This gang must have thought that the ghost was me. Señor Lash, this man looks a lot like you. That is why your identity must be kept secret. If they found out that the ghost was a lawyer, your life would be in danger. And if the bands confused you with the ghost of the border, you can end up hanged. I would offer to help my men, but you hurt them. Thank you, Marshal, we will take care of this work on our own. - Isn't that right, Fuzzy? - Exactly. Marshal If it becomes difficult for us, we will send a smoke signal. HOW TO HYPNOTIZE PEOPLE AND BECOME A MAGICIAN Why don't you let me hypnotize these men? I can look at them and say: "Alakazan, Alakazin, Alakazun." And there it is. I don't think we can hypnotize the border ghost, Fuzzy. If he looks like you, you have to look like him. And if you look like him, no one will know who's who. If nobody knows who is who, who will know who you are? That's what I asked you. You read a lot about hypnosis, Fuzzy. Laugh all you want But someday when I'm Fuzzy, the wizard You will no longer be able to laugh. You know, Lash, I don't know if I like this mission or not. - She gives me the creeps. - What do you mean ? I wonder if Ghost of the Frontier may not be a family. You know, you have a brother around here that you haven't seen in a long time. Yes I know. We have a job to do and we better get going. I can't wait to find this ghost from the frontier. Ghost. I just saw the chef. He wants to see you, it's important. Ok, Turk. Put it in the shed. See you later. OK ! Go on and on. Remember that the money goes to Lost Canyon. Take no risk. - How much are you sending this time? - $ 20,000 for Curly Jinx. He will cross the border. Someday your luck will run out, McCord. And nobody will care. I am paying you to prevent this from happening, Phantom. Do not forget. The guys told me that you wanted to talk to me. I was told that a federal officer is trying to end our case. He could try to stop this cart. Better to go with the guys. You get your information quickly. Did you know that Evans escaped with his daughter this morning? They will not go far. All exits are monitored. I would like you to give it a try. What do you plan to do with it? As soon as he finishes burning the $ 5 bills, he will rest. Forever. - And the girl? - I also have plans for her. I take two guys to follow the cart. If this guard sees us, he will kill us. - What are we going to do, dad? - I don't know, dear. We won't be back if I find a way. I don't care what they do to me, but if they get their hands on you... It is not enough for McCord to force him to manufacture fake money cards? Someone comes. Jane, it was one less. Dad, even though we cross the passage, how are we going to get out of here? I have an agreement with the wagon guy to take us. I had some money and I made a deal with him. Daddy. It is not fake money. But the money I earned working at the Mint. They will change their guard in 1 minute, so let's run away. No wonder they don't catch these renegades. It is the most difficult place I have ever seen. You're right Fuzzy, only cavalry would get you out of here. - How will you get in? - It's too early to say. But something will happen if we continue here. I bet Professor Hosenfattle would be able to enter. - Who is Professor Hosenfattle? - Didn't I tell you? This is the man who wrote the book on magic and hypnotism. You better not loosen your saddle, Fuzzy. I think we're going to need some magic here. The magic of the weapon. Wait, guys. There is something strange here. We were following the cart's tracks and they disappeared. This cart has no wings. Let's find. This cart must be on the corner. Dad, there he is. Let's go. We will be able to escape. - Did you bring the money? - Yes. Okay, give it to me. This place is not comforting. - It's Evans and his daughter. - Jeff Thomas helps them escape. - I see, I have eyes. - So, what are we waiting for? If we do, they will go to the rocks and we will lose them. We will wait until they hit the road. Ghost, I think you like this girl and you want them to escape. I said we were going to wait for them to hit the road. Okay, I was kidding. OK, let's go. Remember, without death. Why can't I get the saddle off the horse. Nothing has happened yet. I can study hypnotism. Fuzzy, did you hear that? It looks like we're hunting. These pictures are coming from the road. Let's go to the summit, we can see better from there. Here they are. These men must really want this cart. There's a girl in this, Fuzzy, let's try to get over it. They got the driver. These men are determined, let's go through the woods. Don't ask questions. They'll be here in a second. It should explain better than words. - We think you were... - The ghost of the border. No, it's Lash La Rue. Federal Marshal of the Southwest Territory. And I am your assistant, Fuzzy Q. Jones. My father was kidnapped and kept against his will. He has nothing to do with this gang. It is the truth, Monsieur La Rue. And I am ready to do anything to ensure that they are brought to justice. - And rehabilitate my name. - Then you must be Frank Evans. That's right. This is my daughter Jane. Hey, if the ghost finds out we’re off the main road, he and his men will return. I don't know what to do, but let's do it fast. Fuzzy is right. Follow this trail with your daughter and don't stop. I will join you soon and take you to a friend’s house, you’ll be safe there. All right, guys, let's go back. What are you looking for ? This man was going to receive or deliver something. I think that's it. What is it ? Counterfeit tickets. This is enough evidence to trap the ghost for life. They are back ! What do we have to do? Let's play hide and seek. This will give Evans and his daughter time to escape. They went that way! Let's go. - They're in the area. - We will disperse and look for them. Did you see something? No, but I will look at those stones. They may be hiding there. Do not move. Are you looking for me? Ho, it's you Ghost. I thought it was the old man. We had two, more than one. It's the Phantom. He must have noticed something and ran away. This man is moving fast. Tie those two up and watch the cart. I'm going to join Evans and his daughter, I'll be back later. Alakazan. Alakazan. Alakazin. Alakazun. Than continue. Wow ! It's not possible. What is it ? I do not believe. If Lash was there, he wouldn't believe it. You know, I was reading about hypnosis. How did you get back so fast? I thought you were going to get Evans and his... I didn't leave. I just pretended Didn't you come out? Because you... When did you start smoking? I don't think it's any of your business. Who are you ? Who am I ? You know very well who I am. What are you doing with these clothes? You know, Lash, you look like the Ghost... You look like him. You... - What is your name ? - They call me Phantom. The ghost of the border. Holy Mother. First you will tell me what you did to my men. Then, we will have a nice walk. The man who lived here was a friend of mine named Rand. Sam Rand negotiated with the Indians. The bandits took over the territory and forced it out. You have been very kind to us. Mr. Evans, do you know anything that can help us? Jim McCord leads this band and commands them with an iron fist. Virtually anyone with a reward for their heads passes here. McCord offers high protection. He knows that the law cannot reach him there. I heard that he was making fake money. It is true. You know, Marshal, you look a lot like the Frontier Ghost. Tell me, is the border ghost in the game? He is paid as a bodyguard. There isn't a single guy who wouldn't kill McCord for two cents. Mr. Evans, stay here with your daughter. There is enough food for the two of you. I will find Fuzzy. We'll be back later. Fuzzy? Fuzzy? Fuzzy where are you? "Dear Marshal: When you read this, your partner Fuzzy will already be in the thieves' nest. Take my advice and forget it. Leave this territory. I wouldn't want you to end up with a bullet in the back. The ghost of the border. " Hey ? Where are you ? Evans? Evans is not here. I sent him for a walk with his daughter. Don't draw, Lash. I would hate to have to kill my own brother. I heard about your reputation as a marshal. I thought it was you who captured the guys when one of them mentioned a whip. You're still good at it, huh? You haven't done too badly. You are the most wanted in the country since we killed Billy the Kid. What happened to you ? The last time you worked at a bank in Wyoming. - What are you doing here ? - I'm looking for you and Jim McCord. - I was in charge of this case. - Take my advice, boy. Get out of here while you can. McCord is not playful. Like Uncle Sam, the law comes west. It means the end of men like Jim McCord. You don't know what you're talking about, Lash. McCord is very smart for the law. Sooner or later, everyone will be caught. Billy the Kid, Sam Bass, the Daltons. And one of these days, the ghost of the border. What did you say ? Surrender and you will have a light sentence. You can live as a respectable citizen. No way, Lash. Imagine me as a respectable old man! - That's what the father would have wished. - And what did he get? He was shot in the back for something he hadn't done. Yesterday we were still children in Wyoming. Dad taught us to use a gun, remember? Stop preaching. I went too far. McCord won't let me stop. I'm sorry you say that, you don't give me a choice. -You are trapped. - Don't be silly, Lash. There is no man here who shoots faster than me. Don't say I didn't warn you. - Is this a threat? - Just a brother's advice. Well, we'll see. Okay, Lash, you won. Here is my hand to prove it. Daddy, the marshal's horse. He must be there with the Ghost. McCord is going to be mad at me for not bringing you back. Stay at the ranch, you will be safe here. My brother is inside. When he wakes up, say that we will meet again. Let him not try to follow me. Sam told me that you were back. Didn't you go with the ghost? He thought Evans and his daughter would be back on the trail. He wanted to face them alone. He sent us back with the cart and Jeff. - What happened to Jeff? - He won't help Evans and his daughter anymore. Now he is a client of the cemetery. And the bearded old man here? Buck gave him a mop. He will not try to escape after what happened to Jeff. Either way, it is harmless. - The old man says he's a hypnotist. - Hypnotist? As soon as he finishes hypnotizing the mop, tell him to go to the kitchen to bewitch the potatoes. The cook needs help. As soon as the ghost returns with Evans and his daughter, tell him to come and see me. He knows where to find me. Look, I'm going to have fun with the old bearded man. Hey you. You with the mop. - Are you talking about me? - Yes, you, come here! I think I slipped. You like to play? I once bet 5 cents on a ferret race. In the race there were 4 ferrets. - I bet on the big ferret and... - Forget the ferrets. You have money ? - Is it enough to play? - Do you only have that? I have some small cuts here. Cut the cards. I bet 200 dollars. I have an aces house. Sorry, I got better. Square of two! - Want to play one more? - With pleasure. What are you doing ? I bet everything. You must be careful, I have a good hand. I ride. - Full of kings. - I have an aces house. Wait a minute. It is not enough. I have a square of two. Thank you guys. Do not move. Bring that money back before I kill you. Shooting a man in the back is bad, put that gun away. Right now ! You better go do your job... before you have more problems. Now, if you want to practice shooting, say that to me. What's the matter, Phantom? You look different. The farm. McCord was looking for you. He wants to see you when you get back. If he is looking for trouble, one day he will find it. Hey, Ghost. Thank you for what you did. Forget the thanks, Fuzzy, tell me quickly what McCord is. McCord? It's the one who... Why do I have to tell you? You know him better than I do. Unless it's not... The Ghost of the Frontier! That's it... We fought and I won. So I borrowed your clothes. - I don't like it, Fuzzy. - Me neither. These men suspect me or are up to something. They will speak to McCord. He's the one wearing the jacket. I'll talk to him. Keep doing your job. See you later. - Where are Evans and his daughter? - I couldn't find them. Why didn't you take the guys? They didn't do well after the fight with the marshal. Besides, I wanted them to bring the cart back. It wouldn't be good if the law got these counterfeit bills. I'm glad to finally hear someone using their head. It was well thought out. My cigars are gone, give me one of yours, Phantom. I'm sorry. I do not have anymore. Nothing more. Go get some rest before looking for Evans and his daughter. I don't want anything to happen to him. What did I say, boss? The Phantom is acting strange. I never saw him without a cigar. If you say that the Marshal is a carbon copy of the Phantom, watch out. We can't let things go wrong. - What do you want us to do? - Keep an eye on him. When he picks up the girl, follow him. If he's acting weird, shoot him. I am concerned about your brother, Phantom. If Jim McCord finds out that he is a Federal Marshal, anything can happen. It will be his funeral, not mine. Keeping myself stuck here doesn't help. Come on, Evans? Let me go. I still have time to help you. I would like to believe you, Phantom. I'm afraid your help for your brother is with a Winchester. I'm not sure if you're right, dad. If he is the man I think he is, he will not accept that his brother is killed in cold blood. Don't forget, Jane. He works for McCord. Maybe he had a reason to do that. I think he would help your brother. I thought something was going to happen, so I followed you. Thank you, Fuzzy. This will not cause us any more problems. - How did you get past the guard? - It wasn't difficult. I said I needed to give him a message from McCord. And when I was close to him, I hypnotized him. - Fuzzy. - Well, it's true. Of course, I had to convince him a little bit about it. And he fell asleep immediately. What happened to the other guy? I'm not sure, Fuzzy, I think he's there. Here it is. He leaves again, he must be reached. It's too late, Fuzzy. He's way ahead. What are we doing ? Go to the heights and send the dust signal, the patrol will see. - We need help. - Is that you ? I go back to the Thieves' Nest. I think it will explode and I want to be there. Why the hurry, old man? Hey, it's getting complicated. The first time, I thought you were Lash. When I saw Lash, I thought it was you. I just left him and thought it was him. Now I don't know who's who. Are you you or who's who? - Yes. Where's my brother Lash? - He returned to the Thieves' Nest. - I think he's going to be in trouble. - Does McCord already know who he is? If he doesn't already know, he will know when Lash arrives. Buck and Turk tried to kill him, but Lash caught Buck. What happened to Turk? He escaped and returned to warn McCord. I'll send the signal to ask for help. Go ahead. And good luck. Ghost. I told you to go find Evans and his daughter. I thought you sent Buck and Turk. You know, someone should teach them to do better without being seen. Wait, Turk. Go to that door, Marshal. Marshal? What's going on, McCord? I understood who you are. When Turk said he saw you knock Buck down with a whip, I started to understand some things. Like what ? Whether you were the Ghost of the Frontier or a Federal Marshal. I wouldn't try that. Look around you. You are surrounded. You don't stand a chance, Marshal. It went too far for you to intervene. I waited a long time to have your brother, the ghost of the border. Since you're wearing her clothes, that will be enough for me... You'll be next, McCord. Put your hands up. You are as involved as we are, Phantom. Stay online. I'm taking you to be judged... If you stop me, put a rope around your brother's neck. What do you think of that, Phantom? Shut up and do what he says! The cards were dealt, I bet on Lash. Now get in line, like he said. Or I will kill the first one who refuses. Well, it looks like it's Marshal Lash La Rue. Drop that weapon. You are far from your territory, Saunders. This is my territory, Marshal. I work with Jim McCord from the beginning. That's why he was evasive. You warned him. You know, Marshal Clark will be proud of you. The marshal will not know, you will not be there to tell him. You have 3 seconds for your prayers. Then I will kill you. 1... two... Guys, look. It's Fuzzy sending the dust signal. Well, what are we waiting for? Go! We have to take down the ghost before it catches the rest of us. In the end, reinforcements can arrive. Go behind. you can get it from there. The marshal's ammunition must be depleted. Do you see this log? Let's knock the door down. You will be helpless for a while, Marshal. Your deputy, Cal Saunders, is inside. - Cal Saunders? - Yes. He worked for McCord. Well, Lash, you scared me for a moment. When I saw your brother on the floor, I thought it was you. Take a look at my brother, see if it's okay. I will find McCord. The government is indebted to you, Mr. Evans, for what you did Check these counterfeit notes for recognition. This caused McCord great problems. It wouldn't have been so easy without the Phantom's help. It was he who organized our escape in the cart. and prevented Buck and Turk from reaching us. Come on, Marshal. I can't wait to move on. The sooner I serve my sentence, the faster I will leave. I don't think the judge will be tough on you, Phantom. You helped us a lot in this matter. Thank you Marshal. Come on, Jeb. We are ready to go. Now, if I say Alakazin, you're out of a trance. When I say Alakanzan, you go in there. Are you going to sleep. You hear me. Alakazan. Alakazan. Alakazin. Kazun. Kazan. On here. You couldn't beat me, even if you wanted to, go ahead! Go ahead ! Fuzzy? How did you do it? I do not know. All I said was Alakazin. Translation and synchronization by WesternKasa / GM DEZ2020
