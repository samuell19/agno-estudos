CAIOPUBES TIPPED 5 TOKENS WANKERRJ: COME FOR ME SCHLONG32 TIPPED 5 TOKENS Oh, hey there... It's not an outfit, guys. I got accepted. Thank you all for getting me where I am today, yeah? Bye-bye! I would like to start by emphasizing something I think is pretty obvious, but important: In law, we are not interested in what really happened. What we're really after is a fair solution. Nothing can fool you more than that false, stupid translation from Latin, "sentencing is a sentiment". God forbid being judged by someone's sentiments. If you want to convict someone, you have to be sure. And I don't mean beyond a reasonable doubt. No! I mean dead sure. You have to be sure it was Colonel Mustard with the candlestick in the library. If you can't show the three cards that prove: 1- means, 2-materiality, and 3-causality assessment, it's not worth anything. What I'm trying to say is that criminal justice revolves around controlling the means. No matter the end. Put yourself in the place of a Judge: You're judging a case, right? A serious crime, for example, the rape of a 12-year-old girl. A terrible crime, unimaginable. You're investigating the accused, OK? Then, during the hearing, you listen to a recorded phone call in which the guy confesses to a friend, over the phone, that he raped this 12-year-old girl. You listen to the tape. But this phone call had been recorded on the 16th day after the phone had been tapped. What says the law? That wiretapped conversations are only valid for up to 15 days. So, what do you do with this evidence? You leak it to the press! No, precisely, you do not leak the illegal conversation to the press, you dismiss the case! You say: listen, the rules have been broken, because criminal process is about controlling the means, not about reaching an end. This is the reason why that due process was created. And us, public defenders are also defenders of the fulfillment of the due process of law. It is up to us, most of all, to resist the eradication of the promises made by the democratic Rule of Law. Good luck. Get your hips in line. Put your legs back. That's it. Change sides. You two, move a bit to the side. Where you know him from? - He is Caio's friends. - Stop it. Joaquim is friends with that guy? I was in love with him and you call him "that guy"? - Here you go, girls. - Thanks, Leandro. LÃºcia, "let me keep it in just a little more?" "I'll control myself, come on" - "I'll put a condom on later." - "You're the only one..." Fucking jerk! The worst part is when they say they won't put it in, and then it kind of slips. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, it won't happen again, babe". "Bad deeds are always rewarded." Frida Kahlo. - What? - Frida didn't say that! It must be from some shitty quotes website, like: "Dreams are whispers from your soul." You think? Hold on. Quotes that were never said by their supposed authors. "Bad deeds are always rewarded." Frida Kahlo. No way! Just for the record: new photos on my blog. Hey there. So... did you like it? There's only one thing I didn't like. That you're not in the pictures? That you're going to become famous and forget about me. Correction: I'm going to be famous, be involved in thousands of scandals and then call you to get me out of them. Public defenders aren't lawyers, OK girl? Really? But they can model? You know it's not my thing, Nat. Honey, BDSM doesn't mean just dressing up... - There are... - Fifty Shades of Grey! I was going to say there are thousands of different flavors... I have an idea. You can shoot me chained and tied up. Such an original image of a black woman no historic references whatsoever. What do you think? And what will be the name of the exhibit? Com'on, five seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 You must try to understand. It's about your desire. I'm not talking about that, Nat. I'm talking about... I'm talking about decolonization. Building new images. I'm talking about things you don't understand. Hi, tell me if this girl is reiterating any historical references. What are you doing? You're so evil! What have I just demonstrated to you all? Over the last 30 years many theories have been created seeking to decrease the violence of the State, to contain its excessive power. Which of these theories were really assimilated by the courts to reduce criminalization? Think about it. Why continue to create new theories if they do not guarantee anybody's freedom? This is why I say that criminal law's potential for resistance is exhausted. Excuse me. It's very interesting. We're all here sitting comfortably. Under air conditioning, big windows, great light. Everyone is nicely dressed. It's cool, right? The calmness. The possibility of discussing the good of humanity without anyone ever worrying about having to lie down on the floor in order to not be killed. Very comfortable. What's the point? That this is a privileged discussion? - Yes. - It is, without a doubt! But if we don't discuss, here in the public defense department, ways to reach a more just society, then we're all lost. For us to become a more just society we must all be connected to this society and not be discussing utopic theories. Sorry, but utopic for me is to believe that the criminal system is going to change in an instant. After 200 years of failure. My God! 200 years! It's like a marriage that has been going badly for 200 years and then you think that it will change by going to a marriage counselor. My God! But anyway, if we can't move forward with this discussion, what you must grasp here... You know what I like? When they go like this: "Thank you, Thank you for speaking so sweetly. Thank you for your patience... Makes me want to punch someone. Jesus Christ! You have no idea how hard it is, talking softly like this. Once, I went to a lecture. And the lecturer sat down, crossed her legs... And said: You know what's missing? I think it is missing some hate... You know what it is missing? For us to grab some guns. To kill. Because Urutu has come to steal, kill and destroy. Oh, gosh! She is so incredible! What are you doing? You're so evil! I will! It's OK! So beautiful, this red face! 1, 2, 3. I'm going to count again... 1, 2, 3... Now! 1, 2, 3... Please... I'm talking about every case, including homicide ones. But we can start talking specifically about Domestic Violence Act. I don't know if you are all updated, but recently the Supreme Court has modified their understanding and decreed that in Domestic Violence's cases any injury, no matter how slight, should be transformed into an unconditional liability lawsuit. Yes, but in the case of the Domestic Violence Act the Supreme Court ignored pre-existing laws. Something they could not have done. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has often trespassed into the sphere of our legislative body. It only goes to show just how badly we need someone who really understands criminal law in the Supreme Court. What you're saying here is that by supporting the institution of femicide, or the Domestic Violence Act or the criminalization of racism, that we would also be supporting a police state? What do you think? That our duty is to defend the population against the violence of the State. When organizing criminal law around these types of violence, of these aggressions to human rights, we are defending the population against violence. Yes, these types of violence are systemic. But is increasing State oppression the right way to resolve these structural aggressions? - I think the whole discussion is absurd. - Why is that? Because we are living through dark times. You can't simply abandon all the rights we've conquered. But, don't you think that you're repressing the debate? That debate must be suppressed. Precisely, those people think that women, gays, Blacks, should all be killed. - Do you agree? - Of course not. You really question if law is punitive or not? Look, I just think that we have to always debate criminal law. If not, the laws will all be crystallized. I'm afraid of losing any law, any right. But when the state crosses a boundary, it is very hard to get it to go back later. Yeah, well who are the laws protecting nowadays? God, I love it when white folks get stirred up about us blacks. But still, Jana... we can't stop pointing out that criminal law is selective, right? Look, you are oppressing a man using a criminal system which was built by a patriarchal society. - You are all being oppressors! - Come again? Hold on. They're not being oppressors, the State is the oppressor. Tell me, have you ever been afraid to be at home alone? Of being alone with a man in an elevator? Are you afraid of walking down the street? So, as long as women suffer these threats, don't talk to me about how we're the oppressors. There's this story that really impressed me as a child. A boy that lived next door. He stole something from a local grocery store. His mother found out, boiled a pot of water and then stuck his hand in it. Is that punishment? What do you think? Do you think it's atonement to submit someone to the same pain they caused, throw them into the fire? I'm not throwing anyone to the fire, they did it to themselves. But I'm talking about you. Your role in all of this. Because it is the duty of the public defender to defend these guys. And what do you suggest as a solution? - Put them in jail, punishment? - It's not punishment! Submit them to some kind of violence? Because these men are victims too! There are good people and bad people! Very well. Thinking along these lines, that there are good and bad people. For example, what if this boy who had his hand burned was a good person, all you would have to do was talk to him and he wouldn't steal anymore. You wouldn't need to go and stick his hand into the fire. But then, if he was a bad person would it make any difference to burn Captain Hook's hand? You two, pay attention to practice. Kinda weak, huh? Are you tired already? I think it's time for someone to get back to ballet class. Oh, I'm sorry! Lucia, what's going on? Sorry, coach. Everybody back to work. Pay attention, no big deal. I'm sorry. Fuck. I didn't mean to, sorry. Girl, let me help you here. Let me see. Fuck, Simone! The relationship between the functionalist theory and that of criminal cultures is not one of reciprocal exclusion and can be better understood as both being compatible. And can be better understood... In reality, the two theories are developed on two different planes. The first endeavors... The first... The hypothesis suggested here, replacing conventional theories, is that white collar delinquency itself, as any other form of systemic delinquency, is learned. My relationship with my father ended when I buried my sister. When he and my mother got a divorce he went to live with another woman and had a daughter. Time passed... and then one day we were at home, me, my mother and two sisters. And my aunt Catu called to tell us that our sister had died. We all looked at each other, "but Catu we're all here, what sister are you talking about?" And she told us how our father had had another daughter that he hadn't told us about. And ever since that day any possibility of me getting back with my father was buried along with my sister. In other words, I don't want to have kids. A toast. A toast to all the parents that fucked up our lives. Cheers. We are late. To the public defender course. Shall we go? - What's your name? - Nil. Nil, welcome and thank you for coming. OK? You feel at ease to tell us your story. He hit me the first time in my face during our first month of marriage. One month later I became pregnant and his aggressions kept getting worse. I did my best to hide my body, not use deep cut dresses, but it started changing. I started to get fat. And as I got fatter he would put me down more and more. He'd humiliate me the whole day. He'd say things like... "you're fat, you're ugly, you can't do anything right, you'll never pass in school, you'll never get anywhere without me..." What he said the most was "you'll never make it without me". And just when I was all ready to leave him, I got pregnant with my daughter Duda. And then it all started over again, I was thinking what I could do to not break up with him. Last week Duda had her third birthday. And then, the day after, around midnight. The worst night in my entire life. I went through... He did what he thought he could he did whatever he wanted to me. And then later I spent nearly three hours in the shower scrubbing myself, because I was disgusted with myself. I felt dirty, you know what I mean? Calm, calm down I think you are right. I think I'd be better off getting back to ballet. You have to defend yourself. Is this some kind of game for you? You scared? Yeah. I think your ballerina hands are only good for getting daddy's coffee. I think it's despicable the way you try to manipulate me. But it is obvious that the girls were all at a disadvantage here. And that the professed use of the establishment is only a faÃ§ade. Saying that place is not used exclusively for the promotion of sex is absurd! As if anyone would pay 100 R$ for an hour in a sauna! You seem to know the prices... No sexist jokes, please! The question is "Is it up to the public defense system to discuss ethics or morality?" Can you imagine a prostitute coming up to the judge and saying, "It's true, your Honor, the place is horrible and everything they say really happens." She'd be dead the next day! This "being dead the next day" is what I want to get to here. How can we protect this woman who wants to talk - but knows she could pay with her life? - Regulating the profession. Regulating the market. You talk as if it was something cool, Like, "I want to be a whore". - It's not like that at all. - You don't know that. They are where they are because they are excluded, oppressed, to guarantee the financial conditions for a respectable job for her. - Respectable? - Yeah. We need to be against prostitution and in favor of the prostitute. Would you say the same thing about housekeeping work? They have lousy paying jobs, as well, are exploited. But you wouldn't call for doing away with their profession. Could you explain how you can, simultaneously, be in favor of the prostitute and against prostitution? Because it seems to me that by eradicating prostitution means doing away with the prostitutes. Prostitution isn't a life project! We can't treat prostitution in such a binary manner. And what about the women who have been fighting for years for their profession, who have been fighting their whole lives for their rights? Yeah, it is very paternalistic of us to think we can speak out in their name and say: "Nobody is here because they want to be". - Who would want to be in their place? - Their clients love it!

You're going to drop out of law school to fulfill your dream of becoming a porn star. I hate to tell you but the retirement benefits are lousy. I'm going to be a double agent. Public defender by day, pornstar by night. Like you: taking pictures of kid's parties by day, and orgies by night. No orgies! Artistic sex images. - Artistic sex? - Yeah, artistic sex. Yesterday some guy wanted me to do self-asphyxiation... I can teach you! I can show you techniqu... You're in SÃ£o Paulo Nat, I want to do it now. No! First you have to learn how to minimize risks. Shit Nat, what are you talking about? I think you got this BDSM thing all wrong. It's all about trust, about exchange. You see this? Nice huh? Goes up and down by itself. Super safe. Well, if that super safe cupboard decides to fall, you know I'm here, right? Thank you. He won't even let me go out alone, or talk to my family because he hid my mobile. I was going to sign up for a culinary course but he hid my ID for me to miss the deadline. He's not bad, he's a good man, a deacon at our church, a thither, doesn't drink. Have you ever tried talking to a friend about this? Yeah. A couple. They say: "does he beat you?" And then when I tell them no, because Andre has never raised a finger against me, they say he's just overly zealous with me. Not all violence is physical, Dona Ivone. I don't know if you are aware of it, but many women try to get out of this vicious cycle of violence, want to go back to school, get a job, like you did. And the men think they can prevent them from doing so, And that is what your husband is doing to you, do you understand? The law provides for some forms of protection. Would you like me to explain them to you? She doesn't want to file a report against him. Says she loves him, that he's the father of her kids. Why don't you talk to her husband? Are you crazy? I know this center for rehabilitation of domestic abusers. They have been very successful in treating aggressive men. Didn't you say that she has two kids and no job, that he's the only provider at home? How'll she support herself? This guy is using his power over their financial situation against her and you think it's alright? I'm saying I understand her. Oh, you Lucia, understand what this woman's going through? I'm just saying that financial problems exist and you have to understand how they affect the family. The guy doesn't even know that what he is doing is violence, Nobody explained it to him. And you think you're going to be able to undo an ingrained part of society by talking to the guy? You don't have a clue how money affects this family, do you? We all know that the penal system is selective, It incarcerates certain people and not others. Now, for RaÃºl Zaffaroni what people don't say is that this selectivity of the penal system is not an error of the system itself. It isn't that the system is unjust and we all have to strive for an egalitarian one. For him this is something that will never happen. Because the selectivity of the system is feature not a bug. So what's new in the theory? According to Zaffaroni when a judge is about to sentence a defendant he should think: Look, I know that this person is here because the system is selective, so I'll have to revert things a bit, compensate for its selectivity. I need to treat unequally those who suffer from inequality. Have any of you ever seen a verdict given with this in mind? In "Operation Car Wash". They used Zaffaroni's theory against the businessmen using the vulnerability theory in reverse. In other words, you who have been well-educated must pay a higher price. Unhappily an example that illustrates what I have been saying: all the theories created to limit State violence, to decrease injustice, are then used to actually increase it. As if they wanted to expand selective penal injustice and not level it out. Yeah, but the problem is that justice, like Zaffaroni himself says, cannot be homogenized... Yes, but what is the best strategy to deal with this problem? Disseminate injustice? Aren't we focusing on the wrong issue? To not criminalize or to decriminalize any specific conduct is a far cry from approving it. They always put the onions in. What are you doing here? I'm sorry. You were right. You're a great professional - and I think that... - If I hear another compliment from you. I'll think you're not on your right mind. Circumcised. - Is it? - How can you tell? Look at his bell end. - Where? - Where? Hold it, ask him to move his hand. Do you speak English? We want to see your bell end. It's all gooey. - Is it? - Of course man. Let's tell him he rocks! AUGUSTO: SHE'S GONNA CUM FOR THE 5TH TIME! MRCOCK2020: TIPPED 500 TOKENS MRCOCK2020: FOR YOU, MY LOVE REPENTANTLOVER14: ISN'T THAT DANGEROUS? PINKBELLEND: SHE'S PROBABLY IN THE CLOUDS YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN DUE TO THE VIOLATION OF COMMUNITY STANDARDS Hi, how are you all? Paulo. - Simone. - Nice meeting you. Welcome Paulo. Thanks a lot for coming. - My pleasure. - Nice meeting you. - I had great references from your work. - That's nice. A crime? She's crazy! Ever since she started going to that school she's gone crazy. You can ask in my street, everyone'll tell you I'm a good guy. I'm not going to ask anyone because I'm not a police officer, that isn't what we do here. But if I were to investigate anything I'd check out what goes on inside your house. Because on the street you're a nice guy, but what about inside four walls? I've never hit her. I've never hit you. AndrÃ©, being a man in society isn't an easy job. We think that just because we're men we have to be the big-shot, the guy responsible for everything, the provider. A man who dominates. And then, when the women want to open up their horizon, it is normal for men to feel insecure. You yourself said, "after she began going to school she changed". Of course she has! Because education transforms people. But you preventing her from going to school is a crime man. But, you know what I think? I think that violence it's something you learn. And if you can learn, what else can I learn? Non-violence! And we can teach you that man. Look, Dona Ivone didn't want to file a report against you, but you can go down to the center yourself if you want. My first relationship was with Jorge. A guy from Rio Grande do Sul, white, privileged, rich. And we went to live together, like we were married. But then, when my social life came into contact with his. I thought, "holy shit". And his parents didn't know that he was queer nor that he was living with a black guy. And so, when he decided to tell them that we were a couple, the first thing his mother asked was, "do you support him?" Jorge was pretty important in my life. So first now you are able to look critical on your relationship with him? Simone, didn't anybody ever teach you how to cook? No way man... May I? - Keep going? - Yes. For real! More. Do it stronger! Like this? Even Chaturbate kicked you out, huh? Very amateurish. So you're going to do the honor of helping me out this time? CNC is not safe for beginners. For a BDSM perv you're a bit chickenhearted, huh? You gave up on your desire, is that it? Simone, I'm not kidding. Consensuality has to do with information, if you don't have the information you can't consent to something. You're being overly paternalistic, Nat. Man, I've seen submissive partners be destroyed, with me pick up the pieces. You can't guarantee that there is no violation of BDSM consensuality. "Nobody wants a Broken Toy." Shit, Simone. You can't look at BDSM as if it were separated from society, there are insane people out there. All I'm only asking is for you to keep up your guard. And do you know any sexy guard I can hire? Jerk. When the priest found out that they had come here he kicked them out of the church. Andre had been sober for years. And now Dona Ivone is in the hospital. Still breathing, happily. Sometimes... I think that what we do here... is no use at all. All for nothing. It's not your fault. It's not. He had never beaten her. She'd be at home with her kids. Shit man. Missed you. Serve the guest. - Her glass is full man. - Thank you. Those are the rules... Every un-circ... un-circumcised dick, or is it circumcised? - I've forgotten. - Un-circumcised, means we drink. - Un-circumcised? - Yes. Those are less rare. Rare? No way. I'm gonna start. A circumcised dick is a rare find. Un-circumcised means we drink. So, we drink too much! Less rare. Hold it, let's review it. Where's the VR? No, it's useless. Circumcised tits? Gosh, I kiss you! - It's him guys! - It's that guy. We brought... he doesn't hear us... we invited a friend. He's fantastic, this guy, we got him lots of times. And you recognize him because of his dick? WHERE ARE YOU? MISS YOU I'VE APPEALED, THEY'RE GOING TO RESTORE MY ACCOUNT. WASN'T THAT TOO PRUDE? WHAT'S UP? I REALLY LIKE YOUR LAST TRANSMISSION. I like more your violent side. What'd you like best about the last one? Your trembling body, teary eyes. Want more? I'd do anything to see you suffocating again. 5.000 tokens for an exclusive. OK, count me in. But I want to see you suffer. Slaps in the face, flushing, cumming. I want it all. I'm not going to follow any stupid jerk-off video rules. OK, but I want to see you suffer, a lot. Just give me a call if you need me, OK? - OK. - Take care. For sure. - Have a nice trip. - Thanks. MR COCK2020: I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WOULD BE ONE MORE IN THE GAME MR COCK2020: I HOPE HE MAKES YOU SUFFER. Woww! Fuck you! MR COCK2020: HIT HER AGAIN MR COCK2020: SHE LIKES IT Is that all you got? Screw you. Give it to me. Com'on! Give it to me. Give me. Let it go! We don't have to do this anymore, OK? I know. I don't know, the next time we can use some kind of safe word, just in case. It's OK. I'm OK! Simone, someone here to see you. You shouldn't be here. No way. I bent his arm to tell me what happened. How are you? I'm fine. - Yeah right, just fine? - Yeah, I am. Simone, have you looked your body in the mirror? Don't get me wrong, but I'm an full-grown women. If I'll fuck myself up, or to get fucked up, that's my business. I see. And if this starts affecting your work, that's your business too? This has nothing to do with my work. I like it. It excites me. You know what that is? - Lust? - So tell me, where does all this lust come from? Who do you think controls the website you upload to? A bunch of empowered women? And who gets fucked up by seeing you get fucked? Who's problem is that? What if I'm doing everything the sex industry taught me? So what? What do you think I should do? Repress myself? Listen, I'm real sorry if my sexual desires aren't political enough for you. For my part this conversation is over. You can leave now! Go on, Get out! Cristina Viana was viciously beaten by her own husband, the defendant Antonio Pereira. There is reasonable evidence to believe that the defendant had the intention of killing her. There were... There were two cuts to the head and a triple fracture in one of her arms caused by the blunt force of a crowbar. A hideous crime. Another crime born from within this patriarchal society in which we live. Brazil has the fifth highest femicide rate worldwide. Every two hours a woman is murdered. Cases such as Cristina Viana's however must be taken in context. Antonio Pereira is the son of Ismael Pereira and Maria dos Santos. Ismael, poor, alcoholic, beat Maria on a regular basis. As well as often beating his own son, the defendant, Antonio. This history of abuse doesn't justify the crime but helps us put the act into the correct context to better understand the vicious circle of violence in which this man is inserted. Therefore, your honor, there was a crime, for sure. But we must be careful when stipulating his culpability. Antonio Pereira is an offspring of the patriarchal system in which we live. We must consider culpability due to vulnerability in this case. I ask you, your honor: Are we correct in strictly demanding normal behavior of all the Antonio's existing in Brazil? Shouldn't that demand be minimized by giving him a smaller custodial sentence? Your Honor, she can't do that! Why? There must be an aggravating factor in the offense because of gender identity. No matter what you decide to do with criminals offenders against black, indigenous, LGTBS communities, There has to be an aggravating factor. It is not a common crime. No, it is not a common crime. It is a crime arising from within this male chauvinistic society. It is therefore up to us public defenders to understand our role in transforming Brazilian society by acting against the gargantuan increase of the punitive State. Today we should celebrate an important stage in this process. But remember that your real training only ends in three years, at the end of the probationary stage. Congratulations and good work!
