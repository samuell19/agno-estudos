[uplifting electronic music] [mysterious orchestral music] - [Voiceover] There was a long winding driveway that led to the mansion. Stonehenge it was called, so named by my father. But behind its beautiful gray monotonous walls, would soon live an unknown force that would play havoc with my life. [door creaks] [suspenseful orchestral music] [suspenseful orchestral music] - Oh my God. Oh my God. [drawers rustle] [phone clicks] [sighs] [bell tolls distantly] - Mr. Hunt? - That's correct. - Dr. McGregor is waiting in the limo sir, may I take your bag? - Please. [mysterious orchestral music] - [Voiceover] How was your trip? - [Voiceover] Fine. You know it is true what they say, taking the train is a romantic way to travel. - Yes, the last time I was in Europe, I took the Orient Express from Paris to Venice. As I remember it, it was quite a trip. - Oh I'm sure it was. Why did you bring me here doctor? - Well... [grunts] In your ad, you stated quote, "former police detective seeking employment, "anything considered." Well Mr. Hunt, two words puzzled me, former and anything. - You see, I worked with the Metropolitan police as an undercover agent, narcotics. It took me three years to infiltrate a particular drug network. Unfortunately when the raid went down, my superiors thought it best I leave, change my name, start a new life, and here I am. - Yes. - May I ask now, why does a doctor of your standing need a former detective willing to do anything? - Well... Mr. Hunt, it's a rather unusual story. - I've heard 'em all before doc, nothing ever shocks me anymore. - I think this story might. I was visiting the grave of a friend in this cemetery and that's where it all began. [mysterious orchestral music] What is it little girl? [mysterious orchestral music] Died too young. [mysterious orchestral music] Why do you look so sad? Are you trying to tell me something? [birds chirp] I was standing right there in front of her not knowing what to do or what to think, except, that the girls statue completely changed my life. [suspenseful orchestral music] - [Mr. Hunt] You never married? - No. Until a few years ago, I had a successful practice. I'm a psychiatrist, or rather I was. I'm retired now. But as sometimes happens in my profession, some of my patient's complexes and neuroses became mine. I fell into a state of depression and loneliness. A friend of mine, also a psychiatrist, suggested that I marry, but starting a family at my age didn't seem to be the answer, so I decided... [sighs] This is a strange story. - That's all right, continue please. - I decided to adopt a little dead girl instead. I visited her grave more and more often. It became an obsession. Then I realized that there was some strange feeling between the two of us. We needed each other. Finally... She began to visit me. I'll never forget the first time. I was asleep. Very gently, her hand awakened me. I thought that she wanted to... [bell tolls distantly] Well like when I saw her the first time, her statue at the grave site, I thought then she wanted to tell me something. [sighs] I guess what I'm trying to say is there must be, there must be some mystery surrounding her death. - Well what exactly is it that you wanna find out? - It said on her gravestone that she left this world tragically. I would like to know how. Who were her parents? And who left her grave so unattended? - But why? I know it's none of my business, I'm just naturally curious. - Mr. Hunt, why is the most overused word in the English language. That is why I'm hiring you to find out why. Just name your price. - 200 a day plus expenses will do me just fine. But just so we understand each other, I came to town to do a job, money's not the issue. Now when do I start? [sighs] You started the day you got off the train. Here you are, your first payment. 2,000. Oh by the way, very important, no one is to know about this. You're just a cousin here for a little vacation and you can use my Chrysler for transportation, it has a phone. [clock ticks] [door knocks] - Morning Father. - Good morning. - Can I have a couple of words with you? - [Priest] Please, come in. [religious organ music] - Father, I was wondering if you could help me out. I saw a monument commemorating the life and death of a young girl. The name on the stone was Dolly Cooper. - [Priest] Cooper? - You see, I had cousins that lived in this area by that name, cousins who I haven't seen for years. So I was wondering if maybe you could help me find out more about her, she could be their child. - Of course, come this way. Please, sit down. - Thank you Father. - Now what year did you say that she passed on? - 1980. - 1980? And you said the name was Dolly Cooper? - That's right. - I don't understand, there's no one by that name registered in 1980. - Are you sure? - [Priest] Please, see for yourself. - But... How's it possible that one can be buried without being registered? - I don't know. Maybe Father Johnathan forgot to enter it into the records. I took over this parish last year after he passed away. - I don't believe it. The child's grave is there. It says she died tragically in 1980 and you're telling me it's not even registered in the church books? - But you said that she died tragically? - [Mr. Turner] Mm hm. - Maybe the police station would have some information. If she was in an accident, they would know about it. - I hope so. Well thanks Father. - Thank you. [religious organ music] - No... Nothing tragic happened to any child in 1980. We had two robberies, both solved, a workman fell off the top of a new building, some woman committed suicide, a farmer cut his left leg badly, and that's about it. [phone rings] Excuse me. Constable Strickler speaking. Oh, hi Judy. Yes? Uh huh. Okay. Thanks anyway. No, that's it for now. That was the township office returning my call, they checked everything available but found no trace of a child named Dolly Cooper. I'm afraid your relatives probably never lived in this area mister. - Can I take a look at that thing? - Sure. [sighs] - What about... What if they worked as seasonal laborers or if they were just passing through the district? The child could've died due to an accident or illness they didn't want to report to the authorities, so they simply buried the child in the Weston Cemetery and moved on. - You've got a good imagination there, but how to prove it? After nine years? - Yeah. Is there a local newspaper in this town? - The Weston Evening Star. - Okay, thanks for your time. - You're welcome. [inquisitive suspenseful music] [tires screech] [inquisitive suspenseful music] - [chuckles] He said what? Oh come on, he did not. [laughs gleefully] You are a riot! Oh no, oh that is too much. [chuckles] Just too much. I remember that one. Oh for sure. There's a man here. Oh [chuckles]. He's gorgeous, hang on. Hi, is there anything I can do for you? - Hi, I was wondering if you could help me with something. - Oh I just love helpless men. - Well as a matter of fact, I'd like some information dating back to 1980. - 1980? [inhales sharply] Yeah... Yeah, that's a good year, the rock group The Phantom's were formed and their hit song was Sweet Molly, yeah. And of course mini skirts made a comeback. [chuckles] And I lost the most precious thing a girl can have. - I beg your pardon? - Mickey, my favorite doll. - [Mr. Turner] Are you real? - I know this will probably sound crazy, but I've been waiting for you all of my life. - Well I'm sorry I was so late, but before I ask for your hand, can I have a look at a complete edition of your paper from 1980, now that would help me a lot. - I'll do anything to keep you around longer. [scrambled distant voice rambles] [slow whimsical music] You have no idea how boring this little town can be for a big girl like me. - No, but I'm getting a pretty big peek at what you mean. - There, start with the first three months of 1980. You can use my colleague's desk, he's on an out of town assignment. - Well thanks. And what pages usually cover crime stories? - Crime? In Weston? You've gotta be kidding. You mean accidents, fires, or brawls in local taverns, try the last page. - Thanks. - Call me if you need me. [slow whimsical music] Yeah Jan, yeah. Well I think maybe you should just dump the chump. Uh huh. [chuckles] Oh that's my advice. [slow whimsical music] [clock ticks] [yawns tiresome] - No motive has yet been determined in what appears to be a suicide in a local winery. An investigation is underway to determine whether the recent disappearance of a little girl linked to this tragic event. Elizabeth Cooper was found in her attic room earlier today. Cooper? Miss Elizabeth worked as a maid for the wealthy Niagara wine grower, Miss Bloor. Bloor? 10 year old daughter Dolly Cooper... That's it. That's it! [upbeat suspenseful music] - Find anything? - Uh no, not what I was looking for. - Well I brought us some refreshments. - Thanks, but I really gotta run. Don't wanna run, but I really have to run. - Oh just like that? I mean I thought we were gonna have dinner? - Well next time, I promise, really. - Next time? What's he think, I come with a rain check? [sighs] [slow whimsical music] [garbage ruffles] Well I'll be damned. [scoffs] [paper crumbles] [suspenseful orchestral music] - Miss Bloor? Someone to see you. - Hi, my name is Ron Hunt. - Yes what can I do for you? - I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about a previous employee, that is if you don't mind. - Well Mr. Hunt, a number of domestic and seasonal employees come and go each year, but I'll do the best I can. - Her name was Elizabeth Cooper. - What did you say? - She also had a lovely young girl named Dolly. Is something wrong? - No... It's nothing. Memories. Elizabeth did live here some 10 years ago but she left without giving notice and I would really have no idea where she or her daughter would be. - Miss Bloor, I'm a private investigator and I already know what happened, but I'd like to know more about her daughter's death. Specifically, why she was buried without even being registered in the church books. And why don't the police know about it? - Oh God. [sighs] Do I have to go through all this again? - Miss Bloor? - Mr. Hunt... It was right here at this very spot that I first met them. [sorrowful guitar music] [inaudible speech] When I saw them, I thought my heart would break. Heartbroken, she had the gumption to ask for a job rather than charity. God bless her. I was overwhelmed by their misfortune. She told me how her husband had left them without warning, penniless, that many employers tried to exploit or abuse her, while families turned her away because of the child. [sorrowful guitar music] As you can imagine, that lovely child was like a burst of sunshine in my life. Now you chose anything you want. I discovered how much I needed beauty and innocence around me again, how much I needed someone like little Dolly. As if I were a new mother, I showered her with all my wealth would allow. Not having a child of my own, it gave me great pleasure to see the look on Dolly's face when I took her shopping. I think that's a definite. - I think that's... - [Miss Bloor] I was surprised how pleased I was to have someone in my life who didn't claim to already know everything. Well Dolly, I think these are the last days of Indian summer. - Why do they call it Indian summer? [chuckles] - You know, I don't know. I've never really thought about it, but that's a very good question. I wonder if it has anything to do with the fact that... [regal orchestral music] We spent Christmas at my winter home. I discovered the joy of giving and sharing with those less fortunate. I longed desperately for her love. [inaudible cheerful chatter] Those were the most beautiful days of my life. [inaudible cheerful chatter] But they didn't last long. [sinister orchestral music] We had a very good harvest that year and a shortage of seasonal labor, so we hired a couple of drifters. They must've thought that Dolly was my daughter, little did I realize what they were planning. [inaudible chatter] [screams out] I know it's really hard to imagine that these vines grow very... [ominous orchestral music] Dolly? Dolly? Dolly? [ominous orchestral music] Dolly? I found a note. They said Dolly would be killed that night unless I brought them $25,000 in person. They wanted the money in cash to be brought to them at 10 o'clock. [whimpers frightened] [phone rings] [phone rings] Hello? - [Voiceover] Bring it tonight, or she's dead. - Listen to me, you're making a terrible mistake! [dial tone buzzes] She's not my daughter! [dial tone buzzes] [sighs] Okay Elizabeth, listen to me... We were both desperate. This is what we're gonna do. It was already Friday afternoon and the banks were closed. I gave Elizabeth all the cash I had in hand, some $3,500. Do you understand? - Yes. Oh thank you. - Elizabeth, don't lose hope. Dolly will be back with us. - Who the hell is this? - I don't know. - [Miss Bloor] She explained to the kidnappers, that the child was actually hers, that she herself was only a servant of mine and that they had made a terrible mistake. - The money, it's right here but I wanted to explain something, there's a terrible mistake. [yells out] - [Miss Bloor] They didn't believe her. They accused us of trying to trick them. - You tell whoever's involved the girl is safe-- - It's only 3,500 here. - Oh but that's what I've been trying to tell you. I've been trying to tell you it's my daughter, it's not Miss Bloor's daughter. - Shut up! Bitch! - [Miss Bloor] They warned her that we better produce the money by noon of the next day, and now they wanted $50,000. [sobs hysterically] [suspenseful orchestral music] [sobs frightened] [suspenseful music builds] [sobs sorrowfully] - No, no! No! [sobs hysterically] [sorrowful orchestral music] Elizabeth? I'm gonna go ahead and make the funeral arrangements. - Don't please, don't. Don't, let's... Don't tell the police about the body, let's just bury her ourselves. Let's just bury her secretly by the-- - Elizabeth, Elizabeth they already know about the kidnapping. - But they don't know that she's dead. [sorrowful orchestral music] - [Miss Bloor] The priest of the local parish was an uncle of mine, Father Johnathan. He understood our problem and agreed to put the child to rest quickly and quietly. We buried her secretly that same night. The next morning, oh my God, it was horrible. I opened the door to Elizabeth's room. She hung herself. [aggressive sorrowful music] I had to call the police. To have buried another body secretly, would've killed me too. [aggressive sorrowful music] A few days later, one of the kidnappers was arrested in an attempted bank robbery. They never found the other one as far as I know. - What ever happened to the man that was captured? - He was convicted of the kidnapping and sentenced to several years in jail. I guess he's still there. - You wouldn't happen to remember his name would you? - Vic Morieta. - [Mr. Hunt] Thanks. - A few years later, I had a statue of a little girl erected to mark her grave. Oh it must be in dreadful shape now. I just can't bear to go there anymore. I haven't visited Dolly in years. - I am grateful for the information and I'm sorry you had to go through it again. I think the secret that you, and Elizabeth, and Father Johnathan shared should stay buried. - Thank you Mr. Hunt. [sighs] Excuse me. - [Mr. Hunt] You didn't happen to keep any of Elizabeth's things around, did you? [sighs] - Come with me. Elizabeth left very little when she died. Dolly was really everything she had, but I do have some of her things. Yes... Oh. I think I can let you have these now Mr. Hunt. - Thank you very much Miss Bloor. You have been very helpful. [twinkling music] - I don't understand. How could you learn all this in just 48 hours? - I'm a detective sir, just doing my job. - Well, you've made a damn good start. - More than a start, you know the kidnapper that was never captured? Well I've already located his partner. After spending eight years in prison, he was recently released. He has a small country music band now and they're playing in local taverns. It might take a little to make him talk. - Offer him whatever he asks. Money isn't important, the girl, the girl is. [sorrowful orchestral music] [upbeat country music] ♪ Well I waited here an hour to find my baby, didn't show ♪ I waited half a lifetime but how was I to know ♪ - Give me a glass of water. ♪ She was already running with the boys in the blocks ♪ And I'd never leave. ♪ Everybody told me not to ask her to dance ♪ She'd be - Hey. ♪ Given half a chance ♪ And I could be her only effort 'til the day we die ♪ Over my dead body ♪ 40 years old and I can't settle down ♪ I'll never have nothing to lose ♪ Wouldn't you like something? - Yeah, right. Add a twist of lemon. ♪ Yeah that'll be a life that a cowboy will choose ♪ [door knocks] Hi, can I have a couple of words with you? - Yeah, sure come on in. - Really loved your performance. - Yeah right. You an agent? - Not exactly, but I represent a man who's ready to pay a lot for your services. - What kind of services? - Does the name Dolly Cooper ring a bell? - Look man, you don't know what the hell you're talking about, you got that? - Take it easy pal. I'm a private investigator not a cop. It's my client who wants to know more about the kidnapping, and he's a very rich man. - Listen man, I just spent eight years of my life in prison teaming up with a creep who left me to pay for his crimes. They were all his idea. Now you're coming around here telling me somebody is interested in a kidnapping that happened nine years ago? Who? That kid's mother hung herself the next day. I read it in the papers. - Are you aware the little girl was killed? You see my friend, when you left your partner, he got scared and instead of letting the little girl go, he killed her and sent the body back to her mother. - No, no, no, no, you're full of it man, that's not the way it happened. I would've read about that in the papers. - That's because Dolly's mother after seeing the coffin buried her daughter secretly that very night. It was never reported, the killing, because the secret died with her in the attic. Come on Vic, I need your help. I have to know how that little girl was killed. I have to find her killer and bring him to justice. Remember Vic, he left you behind to take the fall. - Yeah, yeah. You know, I'm starting to like you man. What do you want me to do? - When you finish here tonight, you and I are gonna go up to the Weston Cemetery, and dig up the grave of little Dolly Cooper. We're gonna take a good look inside of her coffin. - No way man, I ain't no grave robber. - We're just gonna take a peek. [ominous orchestral music] So tell me about this partner of yours. - Bruce, when I first met him, he used to be a butcher. You know he was always bragging about how good he was with knives. I don't think this is gonna be a pretty picture. - You got a hairpin or something? - Man, let me handle this, will ya? - I'll drive the car through, don't you go getting cold feet on me. - Yeah right. [suspenseful orchestral music] - [Mr. Hunt] Dig. [grunts] - [Vic] Damn this place. [grunts tiresome] I don't know man, this just don't seem right. - Oh come on, dig will ya? Dig. - I spent eight years in prison and I just look at this, this is not something... I don't know what I'm doing here. It drives me crazy how you talked me into this. - Quit your complaining will ya? - I don't like the look of that thing, and it's pretty weird. [grunts tiresome] Oh geez! Jesus, Jesus. [mumbles] [suspenseful orchestral music] - Like hell she did. Get back in here. [inaudible grumbles] [suspenseful orchestral music] Oh my God. [ominous orchestral music] This is gonna come as a bit of a shock. [ominous orchestral music] This is what I found. [ominous suspenseful music] - This is our last warning. If you don't come up with the money on time, I'll send you the rest of your beautiful daughter. What is this? - Well Elizabeth saw Dolly's dress sticking out of the coffin, she naturally thought it contained Dolly's body. Looks like she jumped to the wrong conclusion too quickly. [sighs] And it cost her her life. [ominous suspenseful music] - That means there's a... There's a chance that the child is still alive. - A small chance, but not a child anymore. If she's alive at all, she's a 19 year old woman now. [ominous orchestral music] - Hunt, you've got to find her. You've got to and you already know I don't care what it costs. - I know that, but something else I've gotta know now... - What? - The truth. Before I do anything, I've gotta know why you're doing all this. I have a strong feeling you're not telling me everything, doctor. - Mr. Hunt, Dolly Cooper is... I'm her father. - What? - 19 years ago, I was working in a mental hospital. [inaudible chatter] - Hello Dr. McGregor. Oh it's such a pleasure meeting you. My name's Elizabeth Cooper. - [Dr. McGregor] My assistant was a beautiful young nurse named Elizabeth Cooper. She had just come from England and she was beautiful. I wanted her and she knew it. [playful orchestral music] The desire was mutual. [playful orchestral music] She had a gorgeous body and she used it well. She was insatiable. Love was anytime and anywhere, my office, my car. [playful orchestral music] - I'm pregnant. - [Dr. McGregor] She became pregnant, three months pregnant she said. I thought of her, of her career, and of my own. [inaudible chatter] Stupidly, I offered her money to have an abortion. She was hurt, terribly hurt. She wanted our child. - This is our, our baby. This is our love. Do you wanna kill our baby? [sorrowful orchestral music] - [Dr. McGregor] She threw the money in my face and walked out. I never saw her again. - You can take your money and stuff it! [sighs] - I wanted to, I really did, but I didn't. And now, I'm tormenting myself for something that happened 19 years ago. You know at Dolly's grave, the name Cooper and the years, made me wonder if she might be our daughter. I've got to know Mr. Hunt. I've got to know what really happened to them. [sighs] - I'll do what I can. - Okay guys, one, two, a one, two, three, four. ♪ You're so fine and she's all mine ♪ She'll be ready by eight or nine ♪ She's my baby ♪ She's my baby - What do you want now? Who's grave do you wanna dig up this time? - I was asked to find Bruce. There's a possibility the girl's still alive and he's the only one that knows for sure. [upbeat country music] Come on, I already know you've paid your debt to society. I'm giving you $1,000 here. Maybe you can buy a little publicity for your band. - Yeah right, what places are gonna book the guy that kidnapped a little girl? Spare me the bullshit. Come on, we can't talk here. [upbeat country music] [footsteps stomp] Yeah, I'm gonna help your old man, but for my own reasons and I've been thinking about all the time I spent in prison while he was out enjoying himself. Yep, Bruce knew I was in the slammer man, he used to send me some money every Christmas. I gotta admit it wasn't much, but it helped. I bought a guitar with that money. Believe me, I had a lot of time to practice. - Did he ever mention the girl? - Bruce wasn't into letters man, just cash. - Detroit. Windsor. Buffalo. Last three are from Toronto, what do you make of it? - Well it doesn't take a genius to figure out that he's moving around and wound up in Toronto. - [Mr. Hunt] Well what do you think he's doing there? - What do I look like? His mother? I told you before, he was a butcher, wasn't he? Maybe he's in Toronto beating his meat. Take this man. I never showed this to the cops, maybe that's why he never got caught. - Where exactly was this taken? - It was taken in front of a scrapyard, I thing it was kind of a front. - You wouldn't happen to know who these friends are, would you? - Come on man, that was 10 years ago, you gotta be kidding. - One more question Vic. Why would Bruce send you money? - I think it's because of the way things went down. I got caught, and he got away. I guess he figured he'd send me some money, help me out. He knew he owed me man. - Does Bruce know you're out of jail? - No, he doesn't know. My parole officer called me about a month ago, said there was some cash there for me, so he doesn't know. - Good, can I borrow these? - Keep 'em man, I don't need anything or anybody to remind me of that jerk, including you. You satisfied? - Yeah. Yours? - Get out. [engine rumbles] - Hi, how are you? - Hi, I'm all right. - Maybe you could help me out with something. Got a quick question, I wasn't disturbing anything, was I? - No. - Have you ever seen this guy? - Nope, never seen him, what'd he do? - What does it matter if you've never seen him? - It doesn't. - Hey Bob, got a minute? Listen, have you ever seen this guy before? - Which one? - The guy on the left. - No, not in the scribe game. But you know, I could swear I've seen this guy someplace before, down at the mall maybe. Yeah, yeah that's it. Reminds me of the shoe shine guy that works down at the mall on the promenade, you know, down by the river. - Promenade, huh? - Yeah. - Good, thanks a lot. - No problem. [door creaks] - What's that? No, no, no I'll be there I promise okay? I'll be there. No I'll be there, look I gotta go all right? I promise you I'll be there, okay bye. - Jack, someone's been looking for that strange friend of yours, you know, the shoe shine guy. - Bruce? Was he a cop? - I dunno, but he had a photograph of him too. - Okay, thanks a lot. [phone clicks] - Yeah. Yeah I got it. Mary hope and the... Yeah, okay. [phone beeps busy] - Damn. [inaudible crowd chatter] [phone rings] - Yeah? Yeah. Okay. All right. [inaudible mall chatter] - Bruce, the cops are onto you. Stay where you are. We've sent someone out to get you. His name is Ron Hunt. [mumbles] Don't panic. Hey kid, come here. - Yeah? - Listen, I want you to do me a favor. See that guy over there? - Yeah. - The guy running the shoe shine stands. - Yeah. - Okay, I want you to give this to him. Don't talk to him, just drop it off to him and take off, okay? - Okay. - Just wait a second, I wanna give you something for trouble. Here's a [mumbles], buy yourself a chocolate. - Thanks. - Hey! - You Bruce? - Yeah. - The boss sent me to help you out of some trouble. Come on, let's go. - Wait, how the hell do I know who you are? - The name's Ron Hunt. Didn't anyone tell you? - Maybe. - Well come on, what are you waiting for? - Well let me get my shit together. [mumbles] [phone rings] Yeah? Oh Jack-- - Listen, listen to me. A guy was here and he was asking... No, will you listen? - Oh our friends took care of it. Yeah. Thanks a lot. [phone clicks] [phone rings] - Where is the son of a bitch? - I don't know. See if you see him? [phone rings distantly] - Get all of them together. I talked to them this morning and we got 10,000 bucks for us to pick up, now where the hell is he? - What do you want me to say to you Mike? - What's that other guy's name at the scrapyard? - Something like Jack, something like [mumbles]. - You got a number? - Yeah I got a number, and I got a [mumbles]. - All right, just what the hell is going on? Look, I wanna get one thing straight, I got no problem with the law. I ain't had no problem with the law in 10 years. - You mean since you kidnapped a little girl? - Oh shit, I-- - Shut up. You see someone's been flashing your picture all over town and asking too many questions. He looks like a cop. So we've been doing a little digging of our own. We found out about the girl. The police probably found out too. You know your buddy Vic Morieta? Remember Vic? Doing time up at Kingston? I think the cops want you for suspicion of homicide. You know Bruce, took a lot of hard work to organize the network we got going here. Do you understand what I'm saying? - What the hell do you want me to do? - We can't afford to have a child killer working for us Bruce, real bad for business, a lot of nasty headlines. - Look, I am not a child killer. It's all a big god damn mistake. - Are you saying our source is wrong? - What I'm saying is I did not kill that child. - Really? What'd you do with her then? Leave her in a convent? - She's alive. She's still alive. [fire crackles] - We're listening. - It's like I told you. This joker was around here looking for Bruce, asking a lotta questions. I told Bruce about it right away and he said that everything was under control. He said that you guys were gonna take care of him. - We didn't, but we will as soon as we find him. Now shit here, where does he live? - And speak up a little bit because I'm starting to get mad if you know what I mean. - He's in an old city building just east of here. - Where exactly does the son of a bitch live? - She lives with me. You know, I couldn't kill that innocent kid. When I heard that her mother had killed herself, I didn't know what the hell to do, I made up a story. I told her that we kidnapped her because I was her father. But I couldn't drag a little girl around. I told her... I told her that her mother had left me, that she wouldn't even allow me to visit her or see her. I told her that I loved her so much that I missed her, that I wanted her for myself. - She believed you? - She was just a kid. Well she cried for a couple of days, but what could she do? Hey, she was just a kid. Well... What do you want to do with me? 'Cause if you take me out, somebody's gotta take care of that little girl. Somebody's got to. - What are you talking about? No one's gonna get hurt. I was sent to help you, not to kill you. You've done all right by us over the last couple of years, we'll take care of you Bruce, don't you worry about that. You got any money stashed away? - A little, not much. I've got enough maybe, but look, I got no ID, I gotta have papers, I need transportation. - Don't worry about it, we'll look after that. Finish up. [glass clatters] - I'll get that. Hey Bruce, put 20 on the leagues. - I'm not taking no more damn bets, I've got bigger business than that. - Asshole. - [Voiceover] Does anyone know where we are? Give me the paper. - [mumbles] because I don't like taking any chances. - Neither do I. This is a hell... [grunts out] [ominous music] [loud banging] Just what do you think you're doing? [argue inaudibly in struggle] - Giant fool, I don't give a god damn about any one, son of a bitch. [mumbles] You're gonna be real quiet now aren't you? - Who is this man father? - I don't know darling. I don't know. But I'm damn sure gonna find out. [ominous orchestral music] Private I, I might have known. - Why would a private I be looking for us? - You know darling, these are the bad people. They wanna take your father away from you. - Maybe... Maybe my mother sent him to find me? [ominous orchestral music] Where are we going? - I don't know! I don't know, don't ask so many questions. - Well I want to go home. I want to go home to my mother. - Shut up! Shut up for God's sake, shut up! There is no mother, you have no mother. There's just me, me, me, you understand me? - Why don't you tell her the truth? - You want the truth? [screams out frightened] - No, daddy. Dad, dad you're gonna kill him. Daddy, please, please don't kill him. Okay? Don't kill him daddy. - He'd kill us if he had a chance. Darling, I know this is hard for you to understand but I'm doing this for your sake. - I don't want anybody to die daddy. - One word rent-a-cop, one god damn word, and I'll put this where the sun don't shine. You dumb ass cop, took me for an idiot huh? Well you got some things figured out. You figured out a few but you didn't figure out everything. Oh yeah, yeah, I'm a bookie, much more than you'll make in your lifetime, but I don't work for no [mumbles] Canadian, I work for the mob, the mob out of Detroit. They're real bad. When I saw your Canadian IDs and your Canadian plates, I knew something was wrong. I knew something was god damn wrong. I'll talk to you later cop, but right now I've gotta get over and see my friends so they don't get the wrong idea. [upbeat whimsical music] Dolly? Dolly? I'll be back in an hour. Just, just stay quiet, don't talk to him. He's full of lies and he wants to hurt you. [whimsical orchestral music] Dolly, whatever happens, I want you to know that your father's always loved you. - Dolly, you've gotta come here and untie me. Dolly, I know everything about you and your mother. - My mother? Did my mother send you to find me? - Your mother's dead Dolly, she's been dead nine years. Your real father hired me to find you, he wants me to bring you back to him. - I, I... I don't understand you. My father is not my real father? - Dolly if he was, would he treat you like this? Would a real father confine someone he loved in a basement? Dolly, when was the last time he let you outside? When was the last time you talked to someone your own age or went to a movie? When was the last time you walked in the sun? - Well he lets me out sometimes and I play in the scrapyard, and he only locks me up when he goes out. It's for my own safety, you see, there are bad people after me. - They're after him! Not you! He keeps you in here so you can't tell anyone about the kidnapping. - Please be honest with me, please tell me who you really are. - Dolly, I'll tell you everything later, we don't have the time right now. Bruce will kill me when he gets back. - How do you know my mother's dead? - See that paper? Look at it Dolly. Look at it! [whimsical music] That's a newspaper article from nine years ago announcing the death of your mother, Elizabeth Cooper. She killed herself after Bruce took you away from her. - Hello? Jack? What the hell is going on? This guy is a cop! - I know, I tried to tell you. - Look I am in deep shit. - Well that's not all, the boys from Detroit were here and they're mad. No, I sent them over to your place. - Fine, just make damn sure they're there. All right Jack. - My mother... She's dead? [sorrowful orchestral music] - Dolly, I'm sorry, I'm afraid so. She thought you were dead, so she took her own life after she buried your coffin in the cemetery. - What are you talking about? What coffin? You better explain yourself to me mister if you want me to help you. - Okay, all right, but I'll have to make it brief. Nine years ago, you and your mother were destitute. You had no place to go. - You wouldn't lie to me would you sir? - Dolly why would I lie to you? Listen, I've told you everything, now pull yourself together. We've gotta get outta here. - What do you want me to do? - You've gotta untie me before Bruce gets back and then I'll take you away from all this. I'll take you to your real father and Miss Bloor. - Miss Bloor? [uplifting orchestral music] - Thanks Dolly. Hurry up. [door creaks] - Who in the hell are you? - The name's Hunt, I'm a private investigator. - Oh yeah? Why you looking for Bruce? - An old kidnapping case. About nine years ago, he took this girl from her mother for ransom. Her father hired me to find her, that's all. - So wise guy, how much do you know? - Not much, just that Bruce is a bookie. I'm not interested in him. - Where's the son of a bitch now? - I don't know. About 20 minutes ago he stuffed a lot of cash into a bag and took off. - Tie the girl. [yelps out] - Nice and easy or my friend's gonna shoot you. Nice and easy. That a girl. [yelps out] I don't want to hurt you. Shut up or my friend is gonna shoot you. [Dolly yelps out] It's clear. - We'll get back to you. - Damn am I glad to see you guys. Look I got something... [gun shot fires] [grunts out] - You stupid piece of shit. This scumbag doesn't even have a gun. - Don't worry about it. Let's go. [coughs in struggle] - Come on, let's get outta here. Listen, I want you to put this on. It's not very warm out there. There, are you all right? Okay, let's go. [screams out] - Hey, couldn't wait huh? - We said wait and now look what we see? - I got a better idea. - Get 'em. [upbeat aggressive rock music] - Come here, come here. - Come on guys, let the girl go. She's got nothing to do with it, she's completely innocent. - Oh she is, is she? Do you want me to check her out boss? - Why do you talk so much, just do it. - All right, come on, move. Come on. [inaudible taunting] [upbeat aggressive rock music] - Try and untie me. [upbeat aggressive rock music] [Dolly screams out] - Die fucker! [screams out frightened] [upbeat aggressive rock music] [Dolly screams out] [engine whirls] - Oh my god. [jazzy blues music] [tisks whimsically] - You goofed. [chuckles] So I bet you could use that drink now. - Vicky! Get us out of here, those thugs are gonna change their mind and come back here and check on us. - So Ron, do I have exclusive rights to your story or what? - Hurry up Vicky, this is no time to horse around. - Don't worry, I called the cops, they'll be here any minute. [sirens blare] - See now look at us you stupid piece of shit, you stupid idiot, you're an idiot. Look at yourself, I'm gonna be doing time and when I get out, I'm gonna bust you. - God, now I know how a sardine feels. [grunts] Hey, get the girl. Oh God am I glad to see you. Don't get me wrong Vicky please don't, what are you doing here? - You're a hell of a detective Ron, but I'm a hell of a newswoman and you smelled like a big story. So I've been following you ever since you left my office. I knew something big was gonna happen, and now I'm here to collect. Who's the jungle girl? - This Vicky, is Dolly Cooper. She is your story. - Oh. - You're going to do time, I'm making you... I feel like killing you, you. I feel it, that's what I feel like doing, I feel like killing you! - Mr. Hunt, as a detective, you are [mumbles]. Here-- - Oh come on. - No, our appreciation for what you've done for my daughter and for me. And as they say, our house is your house. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Miss Bloor, I was wondering if... - Call me Sara. - Okay Miss, I mean Sara, I was wondering if we could... - I think what my father's trying to say is he'd like you to join us for lunch sometime. - Yes. Yes that's what I was trying to say, could we have lunch together? - I'd be delighted. [uplifting orchestral music] - As for you, I'll never forget you. - Why don't you take care of yourself, okay? - Bye. [uplifting orchestral music] [sighs] - Let's get going, I've been waiting a month for this story. - Okay Vicky, sharpen your pencil, I want you to take down every word I'm about to tell you. - This better be good. - Oh don't worry, it will. After all, we've got three whole days and nights ahead of us. - Nights? - Yeah. Nights. - I don't work nights. - Who said anything about work? [jazzy blues music] - [Vicky] Uh oh. - Think we're gonna get wet? [chuckles] - Oh! - Well I tried. - That's for sure. [chuckles erupt] But Vicky, I've gotta warn you, it is a strange story.
