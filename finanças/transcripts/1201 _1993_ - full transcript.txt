The time is 7:35. Please wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Lazy boy, please wake up. Please wake up. Unh! Lazy boy. Lazy boy. Lazy boy. ...cutting edge project by researchers in particle physics has been shut down by government order. Hosea? Mary, big news at Utrel Corporation. Researchers here working on particle physics believe they've discovered a way to accelerate a subatomic particle faster than the speed of light. Now they are using a groundbreaking device called a superaccelerator. But public outcry has been so great, the government today finally ordered a complete shutdown of the project. This tool will help us to finally define the nature of the universe and harness its energy. Now, imagine a facility this size powering half the state of Califor... Hello! Hi... Mom. I'm late. How are you? Yeah, I... I know. I know we haven't talked in a while... Because you're going to ask me if I'm dating. Yes, mom. I'm dating. A lot of really nice girls. You know, I can't even keep track of their names. You want to know one of their names? Uh... Bril... lette. Brillette. Yes. She's French. She's small, but she's wiry. She loves to clean up around the kitchen. Mom... look. I'm really I... But, mom, mom, mom, mom... I will call you later. I promise. Goodbye. Pathetic. That's not how you throw the ball. What's wrong with you? Good morning, Kyle. How you doing? Any work? Hey, what do you say we all clean up the planet together? Huh? Can't do it by myself. Whoa! Be careful, all right? I don't want to see you get run over now. Up yours, my man. Nice. Nice. That may very well be our president someday. Oh, man. Where are the quarterlies? Jackson's ready to cut your throat. Good, thanks. How are you? Ted, do you realize your hair spray may be solely responsible for the ozone hole? Jack. How's it go? You know... it has been a bad morning... Oh! Oh! Jack! Oh, Jack, I'm so sorry. Thanks for the coffee. Rook to queen's bishop. Well, look who decided to show up. Anne, I'm sorry I'm late. - You know I'm doing you a favor, don't you... - Oh, yeah. - keeping you on with a work performance like yours? - Sure. So let's just finish the personnel reports, complete the monthly billing, and clean up the desk by the end of the day. You know, I was working on finishing that... We both know if you wanted to show up on time, you would, right? There was a car accident, Anne. Barry, Barry, Barry, I don't want to fight with you and I don't want to be your friend either, so let's just do the work, hmm? I would hate to kick you out, you're one of the cute ones. You know, she had sex once in 1983, but she didn't like it. What did we do last night? I woke up tasting pavement in my mouth. Well, we drank, and you left... and then I picked up the blonde. - No, you... You did not pick up the blonde. - Yeah, I did. Yes, I did. - She was not even interested in you. - You left, she got interested, all right? You owe me 20 bucks for your drinks. Here's the update on the new filing system. Aah! It's a shocking computer disk. You press that, and within three seconds it shocks you. It's a cure for the common hangover. Is it working? Are your parents related? - No. - No? Well, I think they... are. Morning, Lisa. Morning. Out of your league, man. Did you read the profile? Ph. D. at 25. The chick's got no social life. Look at that. She doesn't even smoke. He knows that. He's offered her a cigarette before. What a jerk. Look. Whenever she's nervous, she always just brushes her hair back over her right ear. - Did you see that? Right over the right ear. - Yeah. I saw. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Listen, this has been going on for six months. Why don't you just go over there and talk to her? What, and spoil our relationship? No. Yeah, you're right... the whole, like, peeping Tom thing you got going is really much healthier. - Guess what. - What? It's time to leave my cubicle. - Right now? - If I had a door, I'd open it. Excuse me. Barry Thomas? Yes, but you probably want to speak to my boss. You see, I'm just a small gnat... - on the great landfill of life. - Well, you signed this... - and you're the man I want to talk to. - Dr. Moxley, you look great on TV. Anne Jackson, head of personnel. I've been watching the news and... - you are a very impressive speaker. - Miss Jackson, two of my assistants... have been removed by some paperwork that Mr. Thomas signed. - Oh, really? - I've already sent two memos to him... regarding the subject and I've gotten no response. I don't think I got those. Please, let me help you personally, Dr. Moxley. - Come into my office... - That won't be necessary, Miss Jackson. Just put them back in the system. - Lois Hope, Thomas Plume. - Done. Miss Jackson, we all make mistakes. Just correct it. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Good day. - Good day. Anne, we just let 150 people go. - You made me look like an idiot! - You are off of technical staff. - Right. - Off. - Off. You will take résumés and file résumés, and that's it. Howard, would you believe it? Howard, is now in charge of technical staff! You... you bounced the head of the program's assistants! I... I... one more. One more slip-up, and you're bounced, you got it? Yeah. Good day. Rattled! The whole office, rattled! You slow down the work, and we all suffer you know that. Let's hug. Just once. It'll break the tension. Eh, just slop me on some of that macaroni. Yes, sir. Oh... That is just terrifying. Excuse me? Are you all right? You don't smoke. What are you talking about? You don't smoke. I'd offer you a cigarette, but you don't smoke, so what's even... why bother even? Rico, can I have some string beans, please. - You know, I don't smoke either? - And I'd like some rice, too. So even if you did smoke, I wouldn't be able to offer you a cigarette. I... just... don't... smoke. So, I'm sorry to bother you. Where are you usually locked up? Oh, I'm just an experiment gone horribly awry... in the personnel department. I see. I'm Lisa Fredericks. I'm Barry Thomas. What is it that you do? Oh... nothing. I just sort of boost morale in between threats of being fired. Ah. Well, you seem to have a mind. That doesn't usually fit in the system. - Nice to meet you. - Uh... It was... nice meeting you, too. Bye-bye. Goodbye. And good luck. I'm not shipping off the continent. I'm just having lunch. Right, right. Ohhh... So, uh, she likes me... a lot. Wouldn't you agree? Yeah, I'd say like you and a vicious ice cream headache are probably neck and neck. Do I always sound like such an idiot, or do I just save it for the people I really want to impress? You're thinking the wrong way, man. What if the ice queen thing's an act? A defense? - Okay. - All right. What if she's the lonely one? Huh? She would be thankful to the first guy that came over to her and said anything. I know these things, man. I know. I picked up a blonde last night, right? Right. Um, right. She's dying to be talked to. I got an air conditioning repair for... Dr. Specter? Sure. Uh... Ahem. Yeah, go ahead. Yes? Barry Thomas. I'm here to see Dr. Fredericks. There's a slight problem in personnel. What, are you going to erase her from the computer, too? It's regarding her paycheck. We're updating our filing system, and I have to verify some personal information, Miss... "Zebo." Otherwise, her check may be delayed. Well, that's the type of confusion we always expect from personnel. Thank you. Well, you don't seem to be doing very well today! Get out of my office! Now! Goodbye. - Who are you? - I'm, uh... - Are you authorized to be back here? - It's all right. - It's all right. - It's all right. Please come in and shut the door. I'm just gonna come in and... shut the door. You know, I was just taking care of Dr. Moxley, I was helping out with one of... Hey! I have a geranium plant at home. That's funny. What can I do for you? Nothing! Nothing. I was just in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd say hello. Hello. You came back in the middle of a restricted area to flirt with me? Is this... a bad time? We spoke for 10 seconds on a food line. That gives you the right to come back into my office and hit on me? No. No. No... No, you don't seem to get the point. I don't consider playful banter over steaming string beans grounds for romantic trysts, sexual advancement, or even... can you get out from behind there? ...even a long-distance friendship. I'm not even interested in a pen pal. It was great seeing you, too. I'm sorry, Barry, but just timing is everything, and this just isn't the time... It's not the time, right? How'd it go? Oh, good, good, thanks. I'll be alone for the rest of my life. But good. Thanks, pal. Drinks tonight? Yes, Howard. Let's just drink our lives away, shall we? Okay. Ohhh... Bar, what's up my man? Are you with me? Let's do it! Coming. Hi, Reynaldo. Señorita. Ah. My dozen, please. Oh? Oh, those are quite beautiful. Thank you very much. Por nada, Señorita. You say this happened just after work? Yeah. What time was that? 6:15. Did you know Miss Fredericks? No. No, I didn't know her at all. I'm sorry, Barry. I know how much you cared about her. I'm quitting tomorrow. What? Getting on with my life. What are you talking about, man? What about me? You're not gonna quit. If I stay in that job one more day, what do I have? What do I have? I have my pants behind a desk, that's what I have. We need two more of these, please. You know, my dad said I'd never amount to much. I don't want to disappoint him. Look, man, I don't know what you're talking about. Okay? Whatever happened today, it was horrible, but it doesn't stop us. We get to keep on going. What are we going to do? Are we going to turn back? Maybe. No. Time? The time is 12:00. I wonder what she was thinking about. Not about me, that's for sure. Lazy boy. I don't have time for this. The time is 12:01. The time is 7:35. Please wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Oh, please. I have a hangover. Lazy boy, please wake up. Please wake up. No, I don't. ...this cutting edge project by researchers in particle physics... has been shut down by government order. Hosea? Mary, big news at Utrel Corporation. Researchers here working on particle physics... believe they've discovered a way... to accelerate a subatomic particle... faster than the speed of light. Now, they are using a groundbreaking device... called a superaccelerator. Come on, Hosea, that's old news. What about Lisa's murder? ...finally ordered a complete shutdown of the project. This tool will help us... to finally define the nature of the universe... and harness its energy. Now, imagine a facility this size powering half the state of California. It's remarkable. If we could actually power a particle... faster than the speed of light, the energy released would be catastrophic. Time and space would be shattered. We'd be punched backwards in time... and then move forward... until the accelerator is fired again, and we're punched back again... in an endless loop, like a skipping record. This circular time bounce would become our prison, and we'd be prisoners without memory... in a cell without a key. Which theory is true? Another tune going out over the KBRY lovers' request... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Scientist killed at work. Come on. ...and temperatures will diminish by early next week. We may s... One of us fell down last night. Oh, man, I'm going to be late again. Okay, I was drunk. Hello. Hi... Mom, I... I'm running late again. How are you? Yeah, right. It's been a real long time since we talked. I did. I did meet a girl. No, I don't think you're going to meet her. Because she was shot. No, not... not with cameras, with bullets. Mom, I... I got to go. I'll call you later. Okay... I was really drunk. That's not how you throw the ball. Pathetic. What's wrong with you? Talk about pathetic. Ho! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Didn't I tell you to be more careful? Up yours, my man. All right! Now we're getting somewhere! Where are the quarterlies? Jackson's ready to cut your throat. On her desk. Calm down. Comb your hair. Iron your pants. Jack, would you believe there was nothing in the paper about Lisa Fredericks? Why? She win an award or something? - Aah! - Oh, Jack! Oh, Jack, I'm so sorry. Can I help? I'll get you more coffee. No! No! No! Thanks. Howard... Damn it! This isn't funny. Well, look who decided to show up. Anne, I cleaned off this whole desk yesterday before I left. You know I'm doing you a favor, don't you? Keeping you on with a work performance like yours. So, let's just finish the personnel reports, complete the monthly billing, and clean up the desk by the end of the day. - I did this work. - I can see that. We both know if you wanted to get in on time, you would. Right? There was a car accident... again. Barry, Barry, Barry, I don't want to fight with you... and I don't want to be your friend, either. so let's just do the work. Hmm? I would would hate to kick you out. You're one of the... ...cute ones. Ow... Did you see that? She came in here just like it was yesterday. You know, she had sex one time in 1983, but she didn't like it. Here's the update on the new filing system. Whoa, whoa, what, you think I'm a cretinous moron? Why would I fall for the same trick twice? Trick? The shocking disk trick. You got me with it yesterday. Hey, how come Lisa Fredericks' murder was not on TV, it was not in the newspapers, nothing? Lisa's murder? Come on, Howard, stay with me, please. You were standing right next to me when she was shot, last night, right? We talked to the police together. We went drinking last night, Howard. You're supposed to remind me I'm quitting today. Homicide, please. Detective, uh... uh... uh... Kryles. We drank. You left. I tried to pick up the blonde. I paid for all her drinks and she blew me off, I went home and watched Batman. I called the Power Line, and gave myself a little treat. No, no, no, that was two nights ago. The blonde was two nights ago. You said you scored. Detective Kryles? Yeah? You questioned me last night about Lisa Fredericks' murder? Lisa Fredericks. She was killed last night. Well I saw it. I was there. You were there. You questioned me. Hello? He hung up the phone. You... You called him, didn't you? You set this whole gag up. I'll go pretty far for a joke, Barry, but I pretty much draw the line at covering up homicides. Dr. Fredericks. Lisa? This is fine. Why don't you have the other papers on my desk by noon. Lisa. Yes? Barry from the lunch line. You... you kicked me... I can't get over this. Sorry. You must have me mistaken with somebody else. You're not dead. I thought you were dead. No, I'm very much not dead and I hope my condition continues. Goodbye. - Good morning, Lisa. - I'm just so happy you're all right. - Look I'm sorry but... - Who is he? I really don't know. I don't know you. Cigarette? No, thanks. Goodbye. - Shall we get this over with? - Shall we? Miss Jackson, we all make mistakes. Just correct it. Absolutely. - Good day. - Good day. Dr. Moxley, rest assured... What's going on? You gotta tell him I had nothing to do with it, okay? Barry, you made me look like an idiot. - You are off of technical staff. Off. - Fine. You will take résumés and file résumés. - All right. Right - That's it. Howard, from now on you will handle technical staff. I can't believe I'm saying that. You bounced the head of the department's two assistants. Anne, Anne, Anne, I took care of that yesterday. One more slip-up like this, one more, and you're bounced. Got it? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Bounced. Hey, come on, man. Come on, man, that... that's my paper there. Come on. - Dr. Moxley. - Yes? I'm Barry. Thomas. We met yesterday. - Oh, you're Thomas. - Yes. We haven't met. Anyway, that matter's taken care of. I heard on the news today, something about a time bounce... that time just stops, goes back, and repeats. They used all my remarks out of context. But I can't really blame them, becuase it's very complicated. But, Dr. Moxley, I think the time bounce has happened. This day is repeating. What an unusual thing to say. But, I've seen it... things repeating all over the place. Mr. Thomas, if the bounce were to happen, everything would loop back to a starting point. Your memory would also be reset along with the rest of the universe. The fact that you think you remember anything about it means it hasn't happened. Don't worry about it. - Good day. - But... Great. Rattled. The whole office, rattled. You slow down the work, and we all suffer. You know that. Right. Right. I'm sorry about the way I came at you this morning. It must have been a bit of a shock. Huh? Are you assuming this moring's encounter has made us friends and we're now going to have a conversation? No! No no no no. God no. That's the last thing on my mind. Good. Can I have some string beans and rice, please, Rico. I just hate meeting new, and interesting, and attractive people. Don't you even think of starting up a conversation with me... can I please have some macaroni? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name. Me? Uh, Barry. Barry Thomas. Would you... like to have lunch with me today? Well I'm... I'm sure you're very nice, but I just don't think so. Aw, come on, I'll make it worth your while. - How's that? - Well, I'll pay for your lunch. I promise not to spit food in your face, or make silly noises with my lips. Thank you. What do you say? Okay. Thank you. Help! I'm strictly into theory. No grease stains. The physical world is just too disappointing. Yeah, but to get your hands dirty and use your mind and create the thing... that's the exciting part. Isn't it? Things do not always work out the way you want them to, Barry. Yeah, but... Lisa! You shouldn't be picking up men at lunch... you don't know where they've been. Joan, this is Barry. Please eat something. You're getting mean. He's not wearing any rings. - Wow. - You are. Oh, relax. Her sister gave it to her. She's available. Aside from dinner with me tonight, her schedule's pretty open. Well on that very subtle and private note... You're... not going to make that dinner. Oh yes, I am, cause Joan will murder me if I flake out on her. - Again. - It was only twice. Okay. No. No, I mean you're not going to make... that dinner tonight. Why not? This day is repeating. The time bounce has happened. Right after work at 6:15... you go across the street to buy some flowers, and you're... shot. I've already seen it. You... you got to believe me. People are saying the same things... that they said to me yesterday. They're doing the same things. The news has the same story. It's all happening again the same way. Ok, prove it. Point something out. Okay. - Oh. - Oh. Ah-choo! I haven't been paying attention. All right. I'll make it easier. What do I do next? Your beeper goes off, and then you get up and leave. Well, I hope you've had fun with your little games. Why don't you call me when you grow up. You have to believe me. You get shot two times. Uh, can I help you? Uh, personnel. Going to see Dr. Moxley. He's expecting me. - Okay. Fine. Go ahead. - Thank you. Looks like it's contained. Just in that one seal. Just one seal... So this means we can't shut the accelerator down today. But, Lisa, we don't have a choice. We've got to keep the accelerator fully operational... until we can get this situation under control. You know this could have been a catastrophe. If one more seal had broken, you would've irradiated the entire lab. Perfect condition. I don't understand what happened. A terrible embarrassment for me. We tell him it's safe, and now we can't dismantle the core for at least two weeks. I'll get a cleanup crew on this immediately. I'm sorry, Thadius. It's not your fault, Lisa. 40 years something's gone wrong... with every damned project I've ever worked on. Well, you're bound for a change, then. Maybe the next project will hit. No, this is the last project I'm gonna supervise. The way the press is handling this... I can't take any further disappointments. Why don't you check the other seals. No cleanup until 10 A.M. Tomorrow. I'll go check those other seals and structures now. Wait a minute, will you. I'll examine them. I'll determine what happened. No, let her do it. Thadius, it's my job. One more seal breaks, and we'll all be reading at night by our own glow. This is my department. Thadius! - I can handle this. - I want her to do it! Thadius, I have been in with this project since the very beginning. It is my expertise... You've caused enough problems... - How did you get in here? - Um... The um... - I want security down here immediately. - Security, accelerator room. Right away, please. You see... Take those files to level three, and call Mr. Stevens. I need to speak to him by 4:00, and get me some coffee, some... fresh... coffee. Surprise. Employee of the month. You trespass into the highest level security area. You accost three heads of the project, and I'm supposed to explain it. I like you, Barry. I really do. You're fired. Give me your I.D, and clean out your office by the end of today. You know what's funny? If today was really today, I would have quit by now. Hey, sorry, man. Yeah, well, stuff happens. What's up? They fire you? Will you believe me if I tell you something that sounds impossible? Ye... Well, yeah. Lisa Fredericks is going to be murdered today at 6:15. This whole day is repeating. We're in a time bounce. Uh, did you tell this to anyone? Yes. Okay, that's why they fired you. It's okay. You're stressed out. We can explain it. You have déjà vu or vertigo, or something. But... But, they have laws against this, don't they? They won't... They can't fire you. Howard... up yours. Sorry, man. Dr. Fredericks, please. Well, will you have her call Barry Thomas, please, extension 322? It's urgent. Lisa! Lisa! Your I.D., sir. I... - Lisa. - Sir, I can't let you in there without I.D. Hi, Reynaldo. Ah, Señorita. ¿Como esta? - Good. Do you have my roses? - Ah, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí. Hey, Bar, hold it. Heh? What... What's up? What's going on, man? Talk to me. Lisa! Get down! Oh, this can't be happening. This can't be happening. Uh... I guess I... I came out before Barry... - when I heard the shooting... - Excuse me, sir. Are you Barry Thomas? All right, Detective, do you believe me now? I'm going to have to ask you to come to the precinct to answer some questions, please. - What? - Wait. Hold on a second. He already gave a statement. We were across the street together and... he, uh, I mean... He didn't do anything. He called me this morning to tell me about her murder. - Now do you want to go to jail, too? - Let's extend the perimeter out to... This day's about to repeat. Yeah, no kidding, Biff. They're all about the same around here. My god, but what if it doesn't? I want another chance! Hey, no more chances, man. You're doing time now. The time is 7:3... Okay. Today I save her. Well, look who decided to show up. Anne, you're absolutely right, if I wanted to be here on time, I would. So I'll finish the personnel reports, complete the monthly billing, and clean off my desk by the end of the day. You don't want to fight with me, Anne. You also don't want to be my friend either. So why kick me out when I'm so damn cute? Mm-hmm. Howard. What? Get rid of that stain. Hm? That's good work, man. You almost prevented her from talking... entirely. You don't remember a thing about yesterday, do you? What's to remember, man? We had some drinks. I picked up the blonde after you left. - No. - Yeah. She blew you off. You went home. You watched Batman. - What? - Howard, I want to explain something to you, but you're not going to believe me, so just trust me. I need to talk to Dr. Moxley. He's going to be here in about 30 seconds, but first I have to talk to Lisa out in the hallway. So, when Moxley gets here, I want you to keep him here. You got it? Good. Hold on. Dr. Moxley, the head of the department, - is coming down here to talk to us. - That's the one. Yes. How do you know that? Trust me. I know. Jack! Lisa! The time bounce... Yes? Is a fascinating theory, don't you think? Excuse me. Who are you? Oh, I'm Barry... Thomas. Well, you seem to know your name very well, and you seem to know mine. Look, I know you're in a hurry, and I don't mean to sound forward, but I'm having lunch in the cafeteria at 12:30. Personally, I hate meeting new, and interesting, and attractive people... I'd much rather eat by myself, but... if we have to... if we have to... isn't it better to discuss how wonderful theory is... and how disappointing the physical world can be? - Wow. - Yeah. - That's quite a qualified pickup line. - Tell me about it. I've been working on it for two days now. - Enjoy your very nice morning. - Morning, Lisa. So please, 12:30. Okay? Don't forget. - Who is that? - I have no idea. Cigarette? She doesn't smoke. You've been worked here for what? Four years now? Pay attention. How'd you know about Moxley? - Moxley was already here? - You... - Barry, you made me look like an idiot. - I thought you were going to keep... - You are off of technical staff. Off... - I know. I know all about it. Dr. Moxley? Oh, Bill. You wanted to see me about the... Joan, I need the isotope studies from Dr. Morgenrau. John. Oh, yes. Doctor Fredericks. Hi. Should let us fire it just once, don't you think? If we're right, we disprove Einstein. That's pretty groundbreaking work. Of course it is. Looks, it's been three years of my life. What are we supposed to do, break the law? Some people would. Look, they told us to pull the plug, and we're pulling it. Don't make this more difficult than it already is. - Okay - Okay Oh, by the way, I saw some coolant studies in the lab. They look like yours. That's funny. I thought I brought them all back. Oh, Bert, I'm sorry I snapped. It's not about you. It's all right. All right. Forget it. Oh, Marilyn. Do you have those papers I needed? I'll have them this afternoon. Soon enough? Yeah, fine. Thank you. Shut up. I believe you wanted the string beans. They're quite excellent today. You are a very unusual person. So wait a second. What do you do again? Well, I used to work in personnel, but now I'm just sort of trying to figure out my life. You're changing jobs? No. No. The job is the same... every morning. I want to show you something. Look over there... in the lunch line there. You see those two people? They're about to bump into each other. And that woman right there? She's gonna sneak an olive off the salad bar. See that guy... right there? He's gonna sneeze. Ah-choo! Okay, you're psychic. No. No, I'm just learning to appreciate the moment. It seems to be all I have anymore. Do you believe in second chances? No. Um, no, I don't. What if... What if the time bounce really happened... and you had a second chance... to know someone, someone you watched from a distance... and then got closer to? Someone you talked to once, and really got to know. Like... what their favorite flower was. Like red roses. Well, you could have seen me buy them. Your ring? Your sister gave you that ring. Joan sat there yesterday and told me. She's... supposed to be here today, but something happened. She's not here. I told her I had a lunch date. This is very weird. Look, you're a scientist. Let's talk theory. Okay? - The time bounce must have hap... Barry! Oh, excuse me, Dr. Fredericks. I've just had a complaint that... Mr. Thomas here was seen in your office this morning. What? Look, I was passing by and I saw Denk go in to your office... and he was looking through your files. - He took something while you were checking the coolant studies. - What were you doing in my office? I don't... I am so sorry. If I had known about this, I would have had him fired immediately. Look. I made a time map of everything that hap... I'd like an answer of what you were doing in Wing B. Right up to 6:15. You go across the street... - and you buy some flowers and... - I'm not interested. I know this sounds crazy, but you're killed. - You're shot. I've seen it twice now. - You are fired. You have one hour, one hour to clean out your desk. - Fine! I'll do it... - Yes, or I will call security. - You are fired. Get out. - G... Goodbye. Your beeper's about to go off. Ohh... Dr. Fredericks, I am so sorry. Oh. Well... what a disappointment. Actually, I didn't hire him. He was here when I came. Hey, man, sorry about the job. Thanks, Jack. Hey, what happened, man? Did she fire you? - I need a yellow utility worker badge. Got one? - Why? You don't... - Listen, man, I want to have children. Okay? - Yeah. Stay out of my stuff. Okay? Jackson'll castrate me. Look, she doesn't come back until 1:20 that's when she fired me yesterday. We got four minutes. So, the air-conditioning repair guy, he goes back into the science wing at 1:40. That's 24 minutes from now. If you could just whip me up one of those work requisition orders... I could just fake my way through. Okay? No, I don't know what... People can die of stress, Barry. It happens. It's happening to me. What are you doing? You redecorating? I'm about to be blacklisted. I'll have to be crossing guard at a feminist camp for the rest of my life. Yes, Miss Jackson. - Oh, god. I'm... - We're done. Annette, take those files to Level 3... and call Mr. Stevens. I need to speak to him by 4:00... and get me some coffee, some fresh coffee. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Oh, Miss Jackson, what happened? - Annette, what did you do to my chair? - I don't understand. Promise me one thing all right? That your just not going to have... a large furry pungent bear child coming streaming out of your chest. - Just promise me. - Promise! Hey, how ya doin'? I have to repair an air-conditioning unit for... Dr. Specter. Where's your uniform? Hey, they told me to carry a window. They didn't tell me that the paint was wet. Right? You know? - They'll get me another one. - All right. Go ahead. Thanks. Ahem. I have an air-conditioning repair for a Dr. Moxley. This says Dr. Specter's office. Oh! Moxley, Specter. What's the difference? All these offices are interconnected. It could be 100 degrees in there tomorrow morning. Just sign this. I don't understand what happened. This is a terrible embarrassment for me. We tell them it's safe... and now we can't dismantle the core for another two weeks. I'll get a clean up on this immediately. Let's go, Denk. Come on. This is Robert Denk. We broke an isotope seal in the core. I need a cleanup crew immediately. All right. Clear a cleanup crew for tomorrow at 10 A.M. Ahh. Come on, Lisa. Get your butt out here. What's up? Come into my office. Stay off of hardware. That's my business. I'll take responsibility. You will not take responsibility! Thadius has asked me to check on your work... and we have equal status around here, - Damn it! - Doctor. Let me do what I do well and we won't have any problems. You're not doing very well today. Do not jeopardize the time I put in here. Is that clear? Don't interfere with my work. I'm warning you. Don't you threaten me. Get out of my office! Now! Fine. What are you doing in my office? Uh, air-conditioning repair. Nothing to worry about though. Good thing I was here. Your office would've been a sauna by tomorrow morning. I've got an air-conditioning repair for, uh, Dr. Specter. Yeah, right. Uh, yes. Somebody's already here. That's impossible. They just called me 30 minutes ago, and I just got here. We might have an illegal entry. Two minutes of your time, please. What are you doing here? - No no no no no. - Security. No no. Listen to me, the accelerator is going to be fired tonight. - That's impossible. We're dismantling it. - It's not impossible. - I want you out of my office. - You're not dismantling it because the seal has broken. How do you know that? That's classified information. Look, go check the computer. Someone is delaying you on purpose. They sabotaged it so it can't be dismantled, so now they can fire it tonight. Please. Check the computer If I am wrong, I will be happy to throw myself out of your office. Please. Ok... Please. I should have clearance for this. You see that? They're trying to keep the information hidden. There's a file I don't use anymore... Mathematical theory that should still be linked to the accelerator. Oh, my god. I've been trying to tell you now for two days. Attention, we have a security alert... for all science divisions. Please detain a worker with paperwork for Dr. Specter. Guess who. I gotta get out of here. Don't. I can explain it to them. You're gonna explain it to them? What are you going to say, that the day is repeating? Believe me, it's not gonna work. I've tried it before. Just meet me out by the front entrance at 6:00. Don't do anything. Don't talk to anybody. Okay? 6:00. We've got him. Code 4. Section "B". - Heading into the mainway! - Hey, watch it. Oh, hey! Hey, you're under arrest. Hey, stop! He's gonna get away. Hold it, Mister! Hold it! Hold it right there! Hold it! Hold it! Buddy! He's in a brown four-door. - Call the main gate. - Yeah, I got it. Yes? It's me. Look, we may have a problem. Fredericks is working with someone. I don't know! I may need some help in this. Good. When you find him, you know what to do. All right. Okay, um... I'll see you tomorrow. Stay there. Stay there, Lisa. No. Thank you. Oh... No! Oh, my god! I told you I'm not crazy. Get up. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Call the police! Move! Move! Move! You all right? I don't know. Oh, god. What did you do after I left the office? What? - I... - What did you do? I copied the evidence against Denk. Onto a disk? Yeah. Have you got it? No. I left my briefcase. Oh, god. Oh, god. Watch out! Aah! Hold on! Move it! Back it up! Get it out of there! We'd better call Washington or the police or somebody. There's no phone in there. I'm sorry? My mom's idea. The old man brings his mobile anyway. You know. - What? - He's, you know. There's no phone, there's no disk. What are we supposed to do, mail in a complaint? We have time. We'll think of something. Aw, it's... it's beautiful. You know, the last time I was in the woods, I was 9 years old. I was burying my pet canary, and I made a gravestone out of a paper plate... and I wrote on it... "Fly to heaven." Hmm. I haven't told anyone that in... 20 years. Why do you remember? What makes you different from the rest of us? I don't know. My memory's not that great anyway. I... I don't know. Something happened to you, or... Or you did something. What... What did you do that first night? Well, after you got shot... I got drunk. I came home. I knocked a bunch of stuff over. I collapsed in bed. And, I woke up. - It was the same day. - No, you're missing something. No, that's it. Believe me. My life is that exciting. You drove through something unusual. You were near metal or a chemical or something. You were hit by lightning. - Come on now. Use your mind. - Okay. All right. All right. I... I collapsed in bed, my clock said 12:01, - and I got a shock. - A shock? Yeah, my lamp was broken. There were some loose wires. I tried to fix it, but it was plugged in. I lit up like a Christmas tree. And then? Then... it was morning. There's a theory... Scott's theory has a corollary... that says consciousness exists separate from the time bounce. You could've gotten that bad shock... just when the first bounce happened. Then maybe it changed your energy level. It pushed you out of the loop just enough so that you can remember. I bet you that's it! Lucky me. Barry, I'm... I'm sorry. No, no. It's... I mean, you saved my life. Self-interest. I... I've been watching you... out of my office for such a long time. The other day, I gathered up the nerve to actually speak to you. I made a fool out of myself. But I thought, hey, I'll have another chance to speak to you someday. Right? But then you... well... We spoke? Yeah. Yeah, we did. How was I? You were great. You were very nice. You threw me out of your office. I'm sorry. I... I guess I was having a bad day. That next morning when I saw you... Alive... I realized I had a second chance... A chance to save you. I'm sorry. Hey, hey. I'm not going to let you die again. - Hi. - Hi. You know, I'm usually not this type of guy. I'm supposed to say that. What time is it? Oh, my god. It's 12:00. No. We've got to do something. There's no time. Quick. Tell... Tell me what your favorite color is. What? Just... Just... What's your favorite color? Green. Your favorite food. Smoked oysters. Your favorite number. 37.1. Favorite music. That's hard. - Come on. Just tell me. - I'm a little embaressed. - What is it? - The Carpenters. The Carpenters. You got to be kidding. Lisa... I love you. The time is 7:35. Please wake up. 9:17... Lisa's in corridor with Denk. Lights cigarette. 9:25... Denk goes through Lisa's office. 12:30... Lunch with Lisa. Mom, I'll call you back. The day's repeating. 1:00... Lisa's beeper goes off. 1:40... You're pathetic. That's not how you throw the ball. What's wrong with you? Well, look who decided to show up. Oh, Anne, don't get your panties in a bunch. If you just left us alone, the work could get done, but no, you're so damn invasive that no one can concentrate around here. So just stop assuming that we're all idiots... and don't you judge people by how cute they are. Well... This is what I get for covering for you all these years. Thank you. Well, it might be time to look into your performance record. You do that. Well, nice knowing you, Barry. Excuse me. Barry. Lisa. Yeah. I'm a little confused. How do you... How do know me? Okay. I know you like it compact without the crap, so here we go. I'm gonna tell you something that sound impossible, but then I'm gonna back it up with some facts. The time bounce has happened. And we have met before... three times now. And you've told me that your favorite food is oysters. And your favorite number is 37.1. And your favorite music is the Carpenters, even though I think you could do better. Now Denk has been illegally firing the accelerator. You're gonna find that out later this afternoon. And then you're gonna transfer that proof onto a computer disk. Now here's where it gets a little sticky. I've seen you shot, twice now, - because of that disc. - Oh. But yesterday... yesterday I was able to save you. But then the time bounce happens, and I wind up here, at the beginning of each day with my memory intact. You see, I'm the only one who remembers anything around here. I made you a time map. You just sit back and watch the whole day unfold. It's 9:15 now. Lisa? Thadius. Barry Thomas? Yes, doctor. I've gotten your memos. You, too, Lisa. Are we all losing assistants? Actually, I... Dr. Moxley, your two assistants are back on the computer. - They'll have their passes back by lunchtime. - Thadius, Barry was just... Dr. Fredericks was nice enough to explained the whole thing to me. Weren't you Dr. Fredericks? I appreciate that, Lisa. Dr. Moxley, you look great on TV. - Anne Jackson, head of personnel... - Anne, Dr. Moxley's a very busy man... I don't think he has the time to listen to you suck up to him. It's sad. Dr. Moxley, if you ever have a problem, please, come to me personally... not to my low-level staff. Well, everything seems to be under control. Thank you, Lisa. I'll see you at the 9:30. Good day. Good day. Good day. Howard! Look. Over there. See that? He's about to light his cigarette. He's met you in the hallway these past few mornings, but today he can't cause you're here with me. What we have to do is keep Denk from finding out about the computer disk. So today I'll take all the information. All right? I... can't just accept this. The epitaph on your canary's grave... you made when you were 9 years old... was on a paper plate, and it said, "Fly to heaven." Oh, my god. Personnel. Oh, yes, sir. Why, yes, they are. Excuse me? Okay. I don't think so. You trust me. You may not realize it yet, but you trust me. Now, let's meet out by the front entrance in a half-hour. Okay? Okay. Pimp daddy, that was great. How'd you do that, man? Shake it, baby. Shake it. Barry, I want you in my office immediately. Relax, Anne. I'm quitting. Okay? It's something I should've done a long time ago. Oh, no, no, no, Barry. Dr. Moxley just called. You're under arrest. Well, what for? For stealing classified computer information. Come this way, please. Hey. Howard... Marital status. Single. And occupation. I don't know. What time is it? Just put down unemployed. Hey, at least it's not murder this time, right? Social security number. Really, you should learn to type. I mean, we may be doing this for years. Well, I could always start again in six hours. Hello. How are you? Thomas. You made bail. You guys got nothing on me. It's a bum beef. Hey. There are second chances. Yes, sir. That'll be fine... How did you get the money to bail me out? Don't even ask why I'm doing this. Okay? I don't even know her. You're not killed today! That's great news! Barry, um... Look, we... You really like me a lot. You just can't remember it. You know I'd love to stick around, but that would be a lie. Barry, call me when your insanity clears up. Close the door. Get... Get in. I don't mean to be realistic about this or anything, but shouldn't we call, like, a professional... - to take care of this? - Howard. - We're not prefessionals. - Howard. Well look, we got to think of something. He's going to fire that thing tonight. I'm going to be back in the hamster wheel. You're gonna... The police kept the computer disk. Okay, great. We call the police. They'll come in and take care of it. - Howard. - It's out of their jurisdiction. We need Washington, - and we don't have any proof. - We need to get back in that building. Is there any way to get us back in? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. The accelerator needs a two-hour warm-up period before it can fire. - Right. - And that means he'd start it, uh, in three hours. If we can get security to tape the lab through their surveillance cameras, we could get the proof that we need. We could stop them. Pay the lady. What? I don't have any money. Barry? You know, we had a lot more fun last night. We did? Yeah. We took a walk in the woods, and we sat by a fire. We sat by a fire? Yeah. Are you saying that you... that we... I mean, did you get lucky? Oh, my god, you got lucky. You got lucky, too. It wasn't just me. This is so strange. I know, but it was also tremendous. The earth moved. Ohh! Want to step in the alley, please? Let's go. You, too. Move. Over there. These are the guys that have been killing you. Where are the other disks? - Who are you? - Shut up. Aw, come on. Why don't you just leave... Listen to the question... Did you make any more disks? Excuse me, sir? I'm not really a part of this... Shut up. There's no reason to have me here is what... Shut up! There are no other disks. I'm sorry, Bar. You tell them that I don't have anything to do with this. With anything, okay? Any information that would give would be useless. Okay I don't know anything. Oh, my god! Hurry up! Help! Check down there. I'm sorry about your friend, Barry. I know you cared about him. That's funny. He said the same thing to me when you were killed. Nothing. What? I didn't leave a light on. Lisa... Thadius is in that house. What? I'm sorry I wasn't able to tell you this before, but... six months ago, the Justice Department asked me... to help them in their investigation of Thadius. Why are you investigating Thadius? Because they suspected he'd broken safety regulations... trying to get the accelerator up and running on budget. What are you talking about? Lisa, he was the one who broke those seals today... to stop the dismantling. Moxley broke those seals? - That's right. - Uh, huh. And we don't know what else he might do. I think we better talk to him. I don't think so. I'm afraid I'm going to need you as material witnesses. Shall we? Okay. Thadius, what are you doing here? I'm sorry, Thadius. It's over. - Thank god, Lisa, you're all right. - Thadius. Now, Robert, you're not going to fire that accelerator tonight... - it's much too dangerous. - What are you talking about? It's true, Robert, your name is down in the computer... as authorizing the firing sequence for tonight. That's impossible. Dr. Moxley, with all due respect, what are you doing in my house? I'm sorry, but I'd hoped to find other disks... with the proof against him. He crashed the mainframe computer at work... before I could retrieve anything. He's lying. Who were you waiting for? Who were those two men in the truck you were talking to? Who are they? Hello, Ted? It's me. Where the hell are your men? Who are you talking to? Don't move! Ah, I'm just, uh, taking off my coat. Okay? Oh, thank god you made the right choice. He set me up. Don't you understand? The accelerator is going to be a $50 billion industry... in five years. He doesn't care about you! Thadius, you said... I said what I had to. Sometimes you do what's wrong to do what's right. I'm sorry. No! Oh! I truly am sorry. The time is 7:35. Please wake up. You bastard. What kind of a man are you? I can't believe it. You shot her... and him... and me in cold blood! Well, that's it, pal. You're finished. No more hamster wheel for me, you slimy son of a... Ohh! The time is 7:35. Please wake up. Please wake... This cutting edge project... by researchers in particle physics... has been shut down by government order. Hosea? Mary, big news at Utrel Corporation. Researchers here working on particle physics... believe they've discovered a way to accelerate a subatom... Hi, mom. No, we haven't spoken in a while. Yes, I have met a girl. I just don't think it's going to work out. Tell me, mom. What? What's all that matters? Yeah? All that matters is how it feels? It does. It... It feels right. Yeah, you said it. Nothing good comes easy. Mom, I'm... I'm running late, but I, uh, I promise I'll call you later, okay? I love you, too. Bye, mom. You're pathetic. That's not how you throw the ball. What's wrong with you? Treat them with respect. They are human beings. You know, you're not such a bad guy... when you get to know you. What the hell are you doing? I know who you are. You're helping the Justice Department catch Moxley, and I want to blow him out of the water. You want to help? Morning. Come in. Robert, what is this? I've got a report. You, uh... you better sit down. Barry here has something to tell you. The time bounce has happened. Excuse me? The time bounce. We're in it. The earth has stopped as we know it. Children don't grow up, people don't stay dead, we'll never have another holiday, and you'll never see another flower bloom. What are you talking about? And I've fallen in love with a beautiful young lady, and, so far, I could only see her for a few hours, and it breaks my heart... to meet her every morning... a stranger. See, I want her every day. I want her to grow old with me. That's why life is so precious... because time passes. Who is this... Who's this girl? 37.1. Oysters. Green. The Carpenters. Fly to heaven. All right, look. We play the day as normal. When he goes to warm up the accelerator tonight, I'll call for backup, you two will be out of it, and it'll be over. Because if I wake up tomorrow, and it's today, I'll kill myself. Well, look who decided to show up. I am Robert Denk, and this is Dr. Fredericks. Oh, yes. Well, of course I knew that. And may I say what a pleasure it is... Miss Jackson, we need more men like Barry. He's an excellent worker and we would like you treat him accordingly. Sorry? - Barry? - Yeah? I'd like that evaluation report of Miss Jackson on my desk by noon. - Sure thing. - Evaluation? Oh, we are like this. - Mmm. - Oh! - Hey! - Ohhh. Howard, you're alive. What are you talking about, man. I wasn't in the bathroom that long, was I? - Oh. - Oh oh oh! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Careful, guys. - Oh! - Ohhh Oh, Jack! Oh, Jack I'm so sorry. This is a terrible embarrassment for me. We told them it was safe, and now we can't dismantle the core for at least two weeks. No one was hurt. The radiation is contained in the core. I think people will understand. Better double-check on those seals for you, Robert. Thank you, Lisa. Thadius, I take full responsibility. I'll get a cleanup crew, and I'll deal with the press immediately. Well... I admire your attitudes. Dr. Moxley? No disturbances. Thank you. ...this is just on an inuition, really loves red roses. May I? - Señorita. - Hi, Reynaldo. - Sell me some roses please. I got 'em. I got 'em. - Really? - It's my pleasure. Hey, what the hell do you... Thank you. Are you aware that coffee is one of the five all-time great smells in the world? No. Well, it is. Then you have home-baked sourdough bread, opening day at Wrigley Field... New shoes... Fresh roses... Rain. Your perfume. Um, I don't know what's happened the other days, but I think we just have to take it a little slower this time, okay? It's too late for that. I've died for you already. I got to get used to this. It'll work out, you know? It already has. And now for the local news. A man identified as Robert Denk, a research scientist at Utrel Corporation, was found murdered this evening. The victim was discovered in his... Moxley hasn't changed the codes. Is that good or bad? I don't know. Dr. Fredericks? Yes. - You must be Barry Thomas. - Hello. How are you? I'm gonna have to ask you to step inside. You're wanted in connection with Dr. Denk's murder. - What? - Dr. Moxley's orders. Listen, fellas, it has been a really tough week. - It has been all Tuesdays. - Sir... I've already been killed today... twice. - Sir, I understand. - So please stop giving me a hard time... - Mr. Thomas, there's no... - because I'm going to have to come back here... in the morning and make sure that you're fired before we get here tonight. Don't think I can't. I am in personnel. Please give her the gun. Please. You guys don't seem to get it. I wake up every morning clutching the pillow, and it's not Lisa, and Jack still gets hit with the coffee. So please, I'm afraid you're going to have to step inside. Go... now... move it... 1, 2, 3, let's go. So much for the surprise visit. How about a little something special at 11:59? Okay. Hold it. Give me the gun. Thadius, you can't fire the accelerator. Why are you trying to stop me? - The time bounce has happened. - You know what they're asking me to do... - is wrong, Lisa. You know that. - Listen to me, Thadius, - the time bounce, it's real. - Go ahead. 15 years ago, they stopped work on my superconductor. - Thadius you're not listening to me. - 10 years to design a phase-gravitational field, - and the Germans beat me by a month. - The time bounce has happened. And now they're going to dismantle my accelerator... - before I've had the chance to test it. - It doesn't work! No! No, I have no more time. Thadius, it doesn't work. Go on, get up there. Go on. Go on. Is there an abort switch on that thing? There's a yellow button. Please don't. Barry! Are you okay? Oh, my god. Ahh! That's all right. Hey, Doc, tomorrow I may shoot you first. I'll just keep coming back till I get it right. Got you a little surprise, Doc. Warning. Power fluctuation now at 30%. Did it abort? No. Is there any way to stop it? No. He disconnected it. Damn it! Damn it, get away from there! Get away! No! Aah! - I can't get it! - I'll get it. There's not enough time. We'll never make it. We'll make it. We'll make it. We have to make it. This is it. No more. No more second chances. Ohh! Aah! No! My god. Lisa, I love you. It's Wednesday. It's Wednesday. Don't move! Don't move! Yes, sir. This man's been shot. Call an ambulance. Who are you? I'm Dr. Fredericks. Dr. Moxley tried to fire the accelerator illegally. He tried to kill us. That's not what we were told. You're under arrest. We have proof! Put the cuffs on and read them their rights. We're under arrest. How about that? We're under arrest. Every minute... will be brand-new. We'll never know what'll happen next. I know what'll happen next. You do?
