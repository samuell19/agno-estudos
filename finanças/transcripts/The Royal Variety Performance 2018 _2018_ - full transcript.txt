'OK, it's fine, Rob's not going to take over, 'and it's fine that they normally just ask one person to host. 'Don't get in your head. 'You are high profile. 'You're a tiger.' I'm so excited, mate. Ten years ago, we started out together. Look at us. I dreamt of this. Yeah, me, too. Except in my dream, you weren't there. Come on, mate, stop it. We are hosting the Royal Variety Performance together, as a double act. Rob, we are not a double act. Yes, we are, mate. We're hosting together, we're a double act. We are not a double act. We are. This is classic double act stuff, isn't it? We are not a double act. That could be our catchphrase. What are we not? A double act. What are we not? Say it. A double act. There we go. Rob, you're getting a bit overexcited. I don't want to offend you, but you need to be a little less Rob Beckett. Yeah, but I am Rob Beckett. That's the most Rob Beckett thing you've ever said. What? We need to be professional. Be a bit grateful to be here. Ah, stop you there. Not a problem. I've been down the shop, got some presents for everyone. Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. What does everyone want in the theatre, no matter who you are? Lovely pack of Revels. And... Pierre le resistance. Pierre? Tea towel. And at the bottom, "What are we not?" Say it. A double act. 'Welcome to the London Palladium for the Royal Variety Performance, 'in the presence of their Royal Highnesses 'the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. 'The show is in aid of the Royal Variety Charity, 'of which Her Majesty the Queen is patron. 'The Royal party are introduced to Laurie Mansfield, 'life president of the charity, and its chairman Giles Cooper, 'before meeting some of tonight's performers - 'Petula Clark, Zizi Strallen, and Charlie Stemp 'from the cast of Mary Poppins. 'As their Royal Highnesses make their way into the theatre, 'the fanfare trumpeters of the band of the Irish Guards, 'together with actor Luke Evans, lead the national anthem.' # God save our gracious Queen # Long live our noble Queen # God save the Queen # Send her victorious # Happy and glorious # Long to reign over us # God save # The Queen. # APPLAUSE 'Please welcome your hosts for this evening, 'Mr Rob Beckett and Mr Romesh Ranganathan.' APPLAUSE Hello and welcome to the 2019 Royal Variety Performance, the biggest and best variety show in the world! APPLAUSE I mean, I can't believe we're hosting the Royal Variety Performance. Yeah, neither can the British public. LAUGHTER Yeah, I know what you mean, Rom, it does feel like there's been a booking error. We're doing this, Ant and Dec are turning on Christmas lights in Croydon. LAUGHTER It's a huge honour to be here to host a show at the incredible London Palladium. AUDIENCE: Whoo! Growing up in Crawley as a small Asian boy, I never dreamed... Oh, no, I think... LAUGHTER I think I've read your bit. Oh, do you reckon? LAUGHTER Anyway, it's an honour to be hosting the 107th Royal Variety Performance. APPLAUSE 107 years of history. Right, so it's taken them 106 of these before they decided to brown it up. LAUGHTER Er... I dunno, Des O'Connor and Bob Monkhouse had great tans. And even then, they've diluted it by making me host it with the whitest person on TV. LAUGHTER Right, Rom, come on. It's unbelievable. Romesh, stop moaning, you should be excited, we're the first double act to do this in years. We're not a double act, OK? When your nan watches this, she'll think you're hosting it with your Uber driver. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE It's a pretty tasteless round of applause if I'm being honest. LAUGHTER Also, why is it Rob and Rom, why is it not Rom and Rob? Well, they booked me first, then I convinced them to have you. If you're not happy with the double act name, we could smash our names together, and be called, like, Rangett. No? No, I don't like that, mate. Rangett sounds like somebody just getting my name wrong. Yeah, that does happen a lot, doesn't it? People always come up to me and go, "Oh, I love your mate Ramesh." And I always put them right. I say, "He's not my mate." LAUGHTER "We just work together." Look, if you're really not happy, what about the double act name I was thinking about calling us earlier? Rob, we are not being called Coffee And Cream. LAUGHTER Cream And Coffee? No, we are not Cream And Coffee. Might as well call ourselves Beckett And Bud Bud. EXAGGERATED INDIAN ACCENT: "Oh, it's such an honour to be here "at the Royal Variety, thank you so much." Is that what you want? It went down well. It did, to be fair. LAUGHTER Right, before we move on any further, we must mention that we are, of course, in the company of two very special VIP guests. Our mums. Hello! APPLAUSE There they are. Looking like the subs bench for Loose Women. LAUGHTER It's lovely. Your mum's here, Romesh! Your mum's on TV with you. That's a shock, isn't it? You're like the Andy Murray of comedy. LAUGHTER Cheer up, all right. Mum, this must be such a surreal moment for you. Your son is here hosting the Royal Variety, and you're technically still an illegal immigrant. LAUGHTER Fingers crossed on the paperwork. No, in all seriousness, fingers crossed you stay. LAUGHTER We are also joined by some special Royal guests tonight. I'm really excited about the Royal party being here. I've been doing some research, Romesh. What research? I went to Hampton Court Palace, I was there for nine hours. Nine hours? Yeah, I got lost in the maze. MUTED LAUGHTER That's an actual joke, that one. Come on, guys! You went for the Bud Bud stuff, but not for an actual joke. LAUGHTER Rom, do you mind... Sorry. I'm getting carried away. It's fun, isn't it? Do you mind introducing the Royals, please? Well, I can do that, but why can't you do it? I don't want to ruin it. Because when I say Duchess, it sounds like when I used to work at the market. It's a bit, you know... "Hello, Duchess, how's it going? Nice to see you, Duchess! "There you go, girl! "All right, Duchess, want some strawberries, Duchess?" It sounds a bit disrespectful. That's because it is disrespectful. Listen, it is my great honour and privilege to introduce their Royal Highnesses... What are you doing? Bowing. You don't bow like that. That's what you have to do. No, you do that at the end of a panto. LAUGHTER Stand up straight, mate, you're embarrassing me. Sorry, Romesh. OK, as I was saying, it is my great honour and privilege to introduce their Royal Highnesses, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. APPLAUSE Their Royal Highnesses, thank you for coming out tonight. You're on date night, that's exciting, isn't it? LAUGHTER It's hard to get out. Have you got the babysitter until midnight or one? LAUGHTER It's always worth the extra 20 quid until late. LAUGHTER I know how it feels. You've also, like me, been blessed with three kids. And I imagine every morning they come running into your bedroom, you look at their beautiful faces and you think, "I regret this." LAUGHTER Right, Rom, we've got to go over here. Why? I don't know, they told me earlier, someone who looked official, they said stand over here. OK, so we've been in the centre stage, now we're moving over, fine. We have an incredible line-up of megastars all giving up their time to support the Royal Variety Charity. Robbie Williams, Lewis Capaldi, Emeli Sande, Luke Evans, Frank Skinner, Cirque du Soleil, and loads, loads more. But to kick off the show in style, we have one of the UK's biggest stars. With an exclusive performance of the seasonal classic Christmas: Baby, Please Come Home, please welcome the magnificent Robbie Williams! APPLAUSE AND CHEERING # Christmas # The snow's coming down # Christmas # I'm watching it fall # Christmas # Lots of people around # Christmas Baby, please come home # Christmas The church bells in town # Christmas # All ringing in song # Christmas # Full of happy sounds # Christmas # Baby, please come home # They're singing Deck The Halls # But it's not like Christmas at all # Cos I remember when you were here # And all the fun we had last year. # Christmas # Pretty lights on the tree # Christmas I'm watching them shine # Christmas You should be here with me # Christmas Baby, please come home # They're singing Deck The Halls # But it's not like Christmas at all # Cos I remember when you were here # And all the fun we had last year. # Christmas # If there was a way # Christmas # I'd hold back this tear # Christmas But it's Christmas day # Please # Please, please # Please, please, please # Baby, please come home # Please come home # Please, yeah, yeah # Please come home # Come home # Please # Yeah # Yeah # Please come home # Home. # APPLAUSE AND CHEERING How about that, ladies and gentlemen? Amazing, the legend that is Robbie Williams, everyone. APPLAUSE Unbelievable. Smashed it. You've done a great job, fellas. Thank you. My mum is here tonight, she is a massive fan. Where is she? Just over there. It's a bit unprofessional, but my mum is a big fan, do you mind signing the album? Is that all right? Yeah. Rob, you can't do this during the show. Erm... Shut up, Rom. If you could just sign it, that would be great. Just leave it blank, get a bit more money on eBay. LAUGHTER Rom, do you mind introducing the next act? Lads, bring that in. You're not rushing off, are you? You are on later, aren't you? Yeah, I'm on for a bit. Yeah, perfect. LAUGHTER Rob, this is not cool. We don't have time for this. I've got to introduce the next act. Yeah, we are up against it. I tell you what, my dressing room, do you mind popping back to the dressing room? You can push that. Off you go. Yeah, you take that. APPLAUSE Robbie Williams, everyone! 'Still to come, Lewis Capaldi, Frank Skinner 'and Britain's Got Talent winner Colin Thackery.' Our next act's daring stunts and incredible acrobatic skills have been wowing audiences around the world. Using dazzling choreography, their performances are made even more impressive given that they are all non-professional and the youngest is just six years old. All the way here from Austria with a mind-blowing new routine especially for tonight, please welcome Zurcaroh. APPLAUSE NEW AGE MUSIC DRAMATIC MUSIC APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Time for our next act. 2019 has seen our next artist catapulted to superstar status. Having produced the biggest UK single of the year, his debut album spent six weeks at the top of the charts, and recently scored an elusive number one single in the US. We are thrilled he's here tonight. Please could you welcome, with his latest smash hit, Bruises, the brilliant Lewis Capaldi. APPLAUSE # Counting days, counting days Since my love up and got lost on me # And every breath That I've been takin' # Since you left Feels like a waste on me # I've been holding on to hope # That you'll come back when you can Find some peace # Cos every word That I've heard spoken # Since you left Feels like a hollow street # I've been told, I've been told To get you off my mind # But I hope I never lose The bruises that you left behind # Oh, my lord, oh, my lord I need you by my side # There must be something In the water # Cos every day it's getting colder # And if only I could hold you # You'd keep my head From going under # Maybe I Maybe I'm just being blinded # By the brighter side # Of what we had because it's over # Well, there must be something in the tide # I've been told, I've been told To get you off my mind # But I hope I never lose The bruises that you left behind # Oh, my lord, oh, my lord I need you by my side # There must be something In the water # Cos every day it's getting colder # And if only I could hold you # You'd keep my head From going under # Mmm-mmm # Mmm-mmm # Mmm-mmm # Mmm-mmm # Your love I'm lost in # It's your love I'm lost in # Your love I'm lost in # And I'm tired of being So exhausted # It's your love I'm lost in # Your love I'm lost in # It's your love I'm lost in # Even though I'm nothing to you now # Even though I'm nothing to you now # There must be something In the water # Cos every day it's getting colder # And if only I could hold you # You'd keep my head From going under # There must be something In the water # Cos every day it's getting colder # And if only I could hold you # You'd keep my head From going under. # APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Oh, what a night we've had so far! Are you enjoying yourselves? ALL CHEER It's posh here, isn't it? It's even posher in the flesh. I didn't realise I was working class until I read an interview with this posh bloke. Asked him his hobbies, he put down "rowing" and I read it as rowing. LAUGHTER That's the world I'm coming from. I'm getting better at being posh. My in-laws are posh. It's difficult adjusting. You know what it's like, Kate, with the in-laws. LAUGHTER I knew they were posh, first time I went round their house, they offered me a cup of tea. In a normal house, "Milk or sugar?" You answer, you get a cup of tea. I went round there, they said, "Breakfast or Earl Grey?" I panicked, I'd just had lunch. LAUGHTER Didn't know what to say. I went round a week later, mother-in-law offered me a Red Bush, I nearly fainted. LAUGHTER My house is getting more middle-class, though, because my wife lives there. LAUGHTER She said to me the other day, "Rob, we've got people coming over, can you put the towels away?" I went, "I have, on the banister. That's where they go." LAUGHTER Now I've got half posh kids, half not. They sound like me and my wife. So they'll be like, "Daddy, please can I have some wa'er?" LAUGHTER "Mummy, I want milk, I don't want 'azelnut alternative." LAUGHTER It's funny when they say something I would say in a posh voice. They'll be like, "Dad, stop mugging me off." "You absolute melt." I took my kids to visit my parents. Old school, working class, my dad was a lorry driver, now a cabdriver. Went round, Mum's in the front room. I went, "Where's Dad?" She went, "He's in the cab." I went, "Why?" She went, "He don't feel well." "So? Why is he there?" She went, "Well, you know, "his life insurance pays out more if he's at work." LAUGHTER He's getting a bit older now. I had to take him to the hospital. He's had his cataracts done, both eyes. And I had to pick him up from the hospital. He don't like me picking him up anywhere, cos I drive an automatic, I never did gears, he's never forgiven me. So I picked him up from the hospital, he's come out with, like, the bandage on. All bandaged up, can't see anything, both eyes. Get him in the car, I've got Gabrielle playing for a laugh, try to lift the mood. LAUGHTER We're driving home, and I panic a bit when I'm driving. Roundabouts, not very good at them. cos I know there's a rule, but when I get there, I panic. So what I do is I get in the middle lane, wait for someone to come on the inside and when they go, I accelerate and scream. LAUGHTER Not had an accident so far. Anyway, so we get home, bandage, parallel space, I can't get it, I'm in, I'm out, I'm in, I'm out, he's getting more and more annoyed. The neighbours are looking, twitching, stuff like that. I'm trying, and I can't do it. Eventually he goes, "Get out." "What?" He goes, "Get out, I'll do it." "But, Dad, you can't see." He went, "You can, and you still can't park it. LAUGHTER So I got out, because I am the kind of person that will watch their blind dad try and park a car. I'm fine with that. So I get out. Anyway, I don't how he did it, pure concentration, right, he got in there, I don't know how, but he did it in one. I don't know how he did it, because he weren't looking. Just muscle memory, a space he has parked in for years. In one, bang, just using geezer sense. I've never seen him happier. He slammed the door and went to me, "You are an embarrassment." And then walked into next door's garden. LAUGHTER Thank you very much. 'Stay tuned for performances from Mabel, 'Harry Connick Jr, 'and the cast of Mary Poppins.'

Please welcome, the one and only, Frank Skinner! APPLAUSE Hey, Royal Variety Performance, eh? Eh? CHEERS IN THE AUDIENCE Yes, I, um... To think I was working at Birmingham Airport about 25 years... I was. I worked on the check-in desk at Birmingham Airport. I can still remember the day I left, an emotional moment, I said to the guy, "Look, it's been great working with you, "I'm going to miss you all, look after yourselves "and, you know, mind how you go." NERVOUS LAUGHS LAUGHTER See you again. Bye. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE Good job you clapped, I'd have done that for ten minutes. LAUGHTER So, this is not my first royal engagement, I did the Queen's 92nd birthday party recently. That... Oh, I played ukulele at that one. Think yourselves lucky. LAUGHTER And I was very excited, I got home, I said to my partner, "Guess what, I'm going to play ukulele "for the Queen's 92nd birthday party at the Royal Albert Hall. "The Royal Family will be there, it'll be fantastic." I said, "Do you wanna come?" She said... "Who else is on?" LAUGHTER We had a small row. Not too big. I wouldn't want anyone to see one of our big rows. When me and my partner have one of our big rows, I think if someone watched us, it would be like watching a band in concert. Cos we start off with some new stuff... LAUGHTER ..and then we start rolling out our greatest hits. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE That's the applause of recognition, isn't it? LAUGHTER So, erm, I grew up in the West Midlands, which is a, er, lovely... I know, nothing. FEW AUDIENCE CHEERS Really? Oh, they must have given the cleaners tickets. That's lovely. LAUGHTER Er... A different kind of a childhood to your modern child, you know, we didn't have the Xboxes and stuff like that, we had to make our own toys. I had, er... I used to use this, this is an old fashioned nut and bolt here. This was... The pleasure I got from this, as a kid, you wouldn't believe it. What I would do, is every time the fairground came... LAUGHTER Just wait for me, will you wait for me? LAUGHTER We're on the Big Wheel and I'd wait till we were on the top and just go... LAUGHTER Worked every time. The other thing I used to love to do as a kid, I used to do this a lot, I went everywhere like this. On an imaginary horse, cos I loved the cowboy films and stuff. And I had a few mates, as well, a small possy. LAUGHTER We went everywhere, I never walked anywhere, always on imaginary horseback. And the road I lived in, our side of the road was council houses and the other side was privately owned. So we never went over there, we didn't feel welcome. So, we would just ride up and down, looking across. LAUGHTER And we'd see the kids in the private houses on... They'd be in the street on their imaginary horses, but they'd be doing dressage. APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER I mean, there's nothing wrong with that... LAUGHTER So, look, I'd like to leave you with another story from growing up. When I was a bit older, in my early twenties, I used to go to working men's clubs, I used to watch the variety bills. It was a bit like this tonight, a little bit. LAUGHTER And, um... I went to a place called The Barn Social Club in Aston. I don't know if any of you are familiar with it? NERVOUS LAUGHTER And er... A guy came on, he was a singer, and he came on, he was the classic, he had the curly perm and the red shoes, and he did that song... # You're just too good to be true. # Now, the things with that song, I don't know if you remember, there's a really high bit in the middle. The brass comes in... # Blah-dah, blah-dah. # You've gotta be... You've gotta hit a big... # Oh, pretty... # The thing is, you have to start down here... DEEPLY: # You used to... # ..give yourself somewhere to go. Plan ahead. LAUGHTER You've got... DEEPLY: # Can't take my eyes... # So, this guy came on, full of confidence. MID-PITCHED: # You're just too good To be true. # We all, everyone went, "He'll never make it." LAUGHTER It was a nightmare. A hum went around the room, we couldn't look. Two people left, they couldn't handle it. LAUGHTER We finally got to the brass bit in the middle. # Blah-dah, blah-dah. # I heard one woman say to her husband, "You've gotta stop it, Dave." He said, "It's too late." LAUGHTER The old lady actually took my hand. LAUGHTER We were all there, tense. It got to the... # Dah-da, dah-da, da! # And I swear, this singer went... APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER Look, you've been very, very lovely, thank you very much, good night! APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER 'When we return, spell-binding performances from Cirque Du Soleil 'and Hollywood star, Luke Evans.'

OK, well, you may be wondering why Rob and me are dressed like this. Well, Alexey, has very kindly said he's going to show us how to be a contortionist, so... LAUGHTER I don't know what's funny about that, guys. So, we're gonna get into these. Can we bring on the boxes, please? OK, here we go. Right. LAUGHTER OK, so, Rob, you're up first. Yes, OK. Good luck. Do you think I'll be able to get in this one, do I look bendy? No. OK. LAUGHTER Do you think I could be bendy with the right training? Hmm... Not really. OK, right. LAUGHTER You're not doing much for the self-confidence, here. Any advice? Warm up and do some stretching. Stretching, yeah? So a bit of that... Not that much. Not that much?! LAUGHTER Look at that! OK, that is dist... Take it easy. You're ready. Oh. LAUGHTER You're worried I'm gonna put you out of a job, aren't ya? I believe in you. You believe in me? Oh, you're hurrying us along, are you?

Oh, yeah, I'm in mine, mate. It's so cramped in here, so dark, it's awful. LAUGHTER It doesn't sound like you're in a box. Oh, I'm in the box all right, don't you worry about that. Well... Are you sure? Romesh! Romesh! Alexey, everybody! APPLAUSE See you later, I'm off to put a shipping address on that box. See ya. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE 'After the break, the cast of Mary Poppins 'and a very special performance from Emeli Sande.' APPLAUSE Next, we have one of the country's best-loved comedy performers, who's about to embark on her new stand-up tour. She's also a hugely talented actor who delighted us in Derek, Bad Move and After Life. Give it up for the wonderful Kerry Godliman! APPLAUSE Hello! Are you all having a good time? AUDIENCE: Yes. This is a very glamorous do, isn't it? A lot of glamour. A lot of glamour in the room, it's very... There's a lot of pressure on women, er, we get quite dressed up. There's some spectacular outfits. There's a lot of pressure, I mean, I got my roots done earlier in the week, cos until Thursday it looked like I was wearing a tiny hat. LAUGHTER I, um... There's so much pressure on us. A lot of it comes from magazines. We get told what to do and wear from magazines. I was reading in a women's magazine recently, it said, "Women that are over the age of 30, you should be using an eye cream." Right? Right? We're on board, I know. I was like, "Oh, no." So I went to one of the department stores, you know, the really big department stores, where on the ground floor, all the scientists are? LAUGHTER I thought, "I'll go and talk to one of them." And I found one, she was... She had a white coat on. She was definitely a medic. LAUGHTER I said, "Hello, I'd like some eye cream, please." She said, "OK, what eye cream are you currently using "in your eye cream regime?" LAUGHTER Cos some women just shimmy when they speak, don't they? "What eye cream are you currently using in your eye cream regime?" I said, "I'm not using any, look at my face." LAUGHTER She went, "How old are you?" LAUGHTER She got a bit aggressive at this stage, she changed. She went a bit Ray Winston, if I'm honest. LAUGHTER AGGRESSIVELY: "How old are ya?" I said, "I'm 45." "I'm sorry." LAUGHTER She was SO cross! "You're 45 and you haven't got an eye cream regime?! "You're an idiot!" It's very difficult to know how to respond to such a sophisticated sales strategy, isn't it? LAUGHTER I'm quite enjoying aging, I'm not worrying about little things, about appearance, so much. Like, I will never wear a boob tube ever again. That's quite a liberating thing to just be sure of, isn't it? Like, maybe as a hair band... LAUGHTER ..if nothing else. I'm enjoying letting myself go in a great many ways. I went on a barging holiday earlier this year and wore Crocs and socks for three straight days. LAUGHTER I've never felt more alive. I try and not follow fashion cos there's no point, although I have gone for the jumpsuit, which is the outfit of the evening, I think you might have noticed. I don't know why I got involved, to be honest, in a jumpsuit. I get the appeal, cos you feel like a winner in a jumpsuit. You do things you didn't know you could do. Walking around, like, in your middle aged Baby-gro. LAUGHTER Smashed it. It always ends badly if you go on a night out in a jumpsuit. It always ends the same way, you sat on the toilet, crying, drunk in your bra. LAUGHTER I haven't been to the loo for four hours, I can't get out of it. LAUGHTER So, er... I've got kids, as well. They get very excited this time of year, don't they? They're very, er... They're not conducive to being laid-back, children. I get very wound up around parenting, quite triggered by parenting. My son had a day off school earlier this week cos he had an allergic reaction to a bath bomb. LAUGHTER He drank it. LAUGHTER I said, "Why did you do that?" He went, "It's so blue and sparkly, Mummy." LAUGHTER "I wanted it on the inside." LAUGHTER You can't argue with that, I wouldn't, you wouldn't, would you? A perfectly reasonable response. I sent him to school anyway, the next day and he didn't feel well, they rang me mid morning. They were, "He's not well, you'll have to get him." I went, "Oh, yeah, it's cos he drank a bath bomb." LAUGHTER She said, "Why did you let him do that?" What a stupid question! LAUGHTER My daughter's got a phone. She goes to secondary school, so she's got a phone, cos they all want a phone and she's been campaigning from when she was younger. I wasn't keen on her having one when she was too young, but now she's at secondary school, you know, I wanna track her, so I said, "You can have one." LAUGHTER "You can have a phone." And she's been after one for a long time, always arguing about it. She was, "How old were you when you had your first phone?" I said, "28." LAUGHTER So, I won that, I won that. I won that argument. It's hard to explain to people life before, you know. I didn't grow up with a mobile. Explain to young people, that are used to them, life before. Like, before emoji's, if you wanted to flirt with someone, you had to take an aubergine out with you, didn't you? LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Lug it around... Lug it around a nightclub. LAUGHTER It's a right pain. She loves it, she loves her phone. Kids love them. We all love our phones, but kids really... It's like living with Golem. She's, "Oh, I love my precious phone..." LAUGHTER She likes doing FaceTime, kids like FaceTime, don't they? I use it as a phone, but she's like... I get the appeal, cos she's young and she's got a young face. LAUGHTER I don't wanna do FaceTime cos I don't wanna look at my face. It's hard doing FaceTime, you get very distracted by the other face. No, I'm listening. LAUGHTER TEARFULLY: That's my face. LAUGHTER It's upsetting. I do get... I'm trying to be, you know, cos it's Christmas, so I'm trying to be a bit calmer, but I get just drawn into the silliest arguments. I had a row with them recently in the supermarket. I was bombing around, filling up the basket, getting all the gear and my daughter said to me, "No, Mum, we don't like pasta shells. "We only like pasta bows." LAUGHTER I'm like, "It's the same, it's the same! "All of the pastas are the same!" LAUGHTER "The bows, the pipes, the shells and the twists." LAUGHTER "You don't give a toss about a shape when it's chocolate, do ya?" LAUGHTER You've been lovely, thank you so much. See you soon. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Earlier this year, singer and songwriter Emeli Sande released her latest hit album Real Life. One of the songs from the album written by Emeli is particularly personal. Research suggests that every year, one in four of us will experience a mental health problem. It's also become more recognised that music can create a positive impact on our mental well-being. One such choir from Manchester have embraced this idea and are helping change people's lives through singing. So, tonight, hoping to share the message that you are not alone, please welcome Emeli Sande and the Bee Vocal Choir.

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE DRUMROLL SONG: 'Chim Chim Cher-ee' # Chim chimney, chim chimney Chim chim cher-oo # I does what I likes And I likes what I do... # Today I'm a screever. # And as you can see # A screever's an artist Of highest degree # And it's all me own work From me own memory. # CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Stay right where you are. Oh, I'd know that silhouette anywhere! Mary Poppins. It's nice to see you, Bert. Well, I must say, you do look swell. How does he know you? He can't know you. You've only just arrived. I wasn't born one minute before I walked into your house, Michael Banks. Have you met these two, Bert? I've seen 'em running about, chasing a kite. It isn't a real kite! Oh, so what are you up to? I thought we could play our next game. What game? A visit to Saint Paul's. That's not a game. If she says it's a game, she's got someone in mind, you can be certain of that. Best foot forward, spit-spot. APPLAUSE SONG: 'Feed The Birds' # Feed the birds # Tuppence a bag # Tuppence, tuppence Tuppence a bag... # Feed the birds, sir. There's that horrible old woman. Don't point. And for your information, she is not in the least horrible. But she's just a bundle of rags. When will you learn to look past what you see? # Early each day To the steps of Saint Paul's # The little old bird woman comes # In her own special way To the people she calls. # Come, buy my bags full of crumbs # Come, feed the little birds Show them you care # And you'll be glad if you do # Their young ones are hungry Their nests are so bare # All it takes is tuppence from you # Feed the birds # Tuppence a bag # Tuppence, tuppence # Tuppence a bag. # Feed the birds That's what she cries # While overhead Her birds fill the skies... # FLAPPING What are you doing? I'm going to give her my sixpence. What a waste! That's a matter of opinion. Here. One bag, please. Save your sixpence. # All around the cathedral # The saints and apostles # Look down as she sells her wares. BOTH: # Although you can't see them You know they are smiling # Each time someone shows That he cares # Though her words Are simple and few # Listen, listen She's calling to you # Feed the birds Tuppence a bird # Tuppence, tuppence # Tuppence a bird... # Oh, go on. MARY CLEARS THROAT # Tuppence... # Tuppence? # Tuppence a bird. # CHEERING AND APPLAUSE BARKING Isn't that Miss Lark's dog, Willoughby? BARKING Willoughby! Oh, won't you be a darling? It's all right. Mummy's here. You know, sometimes you'd almost think he could talk. GROWLING Now, that's enough of that! Bert, can Willoughby really talk? Of course he can. It's getting him to stop that's the problem. Now come along, I can't stand here all day talking shop. Talking shop? What a silly expression. There's nothing silly about it in the least. What do you buy in a talking shop? Conversations, of course. But there's no such thing as a talking shop. Remember, anything can happen if you let it. That's it! Good day to you, Mrs Corry. Well, well, well, if it isn't Mary Poppins! SHOPPERS: Ooh! With Jane and Michael Banks. SHOPPERS GROAN Now, Mary Poppins, what can I do for you? Well, I did want an ounce of conversation. CHEERING I'm out of conversations, and I'm right out of words too, but I do have some letters and a little bit of backchat! SHOPPERS: Ooh! An ounce, you say? That'll be 15 letters. Go on, take your pick. Jane, you can choose seven. I've got a D, G, R, Q, C, L and I. They're know good, you can't make a conversation out of them. Michael, your turn, seven more. A, F, S, E, T, O and P. And I'll choose an X. GASPING Now, what words can we make? Well, I see "dog" and "cat". Rautoplex, that's nine! Lapitoferus, that's 11. Nearly there. Those don't count, you made them up. And where do you think words come from in the first place? Somebody had to make them up. Hmm... You know, you can always use the same letter more than once. GASPING Now, let me see. Supercali... fragilistic... expialidocious! CHEERING That's not a word! Of course it's a word. And unless I'm very much mistaken, I think it's going to prove a rather useful one. # When trying to express oneself It's frankly quite absurd # To leaf through lengthy lexicons To find the perfect word # A little spontaneity Keeps conversation keen # You need to find a way to say Precisely what you mean Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! # Even though the sound of it Is something quite atrocious # If you say it loud enough You'll always sound precocious Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! # Um-diddle-iddle Iddle-um-diddle-ay... # But it doesn't mean anything.

Having joined the Army at 15, this Chelsea Pensioner went on to serve his country for 25 years in the 45th Regiment of the Royal Artillery. Skip forward nearly 50 years later, and after initially entering Britain's Got Talent as a dare, his moving performances went on to win over the hearts of the entire country. With a very special performance, please give the warmest of welcomes to this year's Britain's Got Talent winner, the inspirational Colin Thackery. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE SONG: 'I Vow To Thee, My Country' # I vow to thee, my country # All earthly things above # Entire and whole and perfect # The service of my love # The love that asks no question # The love that stands the test # That lays upon the altar # The dearest and the best # The love that never falters # The love that pays the price # The love that makes undaunted # The final sacrifice # And there's another country # I've heard of long ago # Most dear to them that love her # Most great to them that know # We may not count her armies # We may not see her king # Her fortress is a faithful heart # Her pride is suffering # And soul by soul and silently # Her shining bounds increase # And her ways Are ways of gentleness # And all her paths are peace. # CHEERING AND APPLAUSE CHEERING AND APPLAUSE 'Please welcome back to the stage, Romesh Ranganathan.' CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Your Royal Highnesses, I'm sure that you're used to being recognised at international events by delegates, etc... I recently got recognised at Chessington World Of Adventures. LAUGHTER And I got recognised, I was on one of those slow rides that goes across the top of the park. I got recognised from the ground. This family said, "Excuse me, excuse me, can we get a photo? "Can we get a photo when you come down?" I said of course, because I'm a legend, man of the people. I get off the ride, I go up to the family. As I'm walking up to the family, the mum of the family turns to her husband and goes, "It's not him." LAUGHTER And then I walk up to the family and they just stand there staring at me like I'm the one that wants the photo with them! I said to them, "Are we gonna, erm... "Are we gonna... are we gonna do this photo?" The dad said, "Oh, no, you're not who we thought you were." I said, "Who did you think I was?" He said, "Romesh." I said, "Yeah, I'm Romesh." He just went, "Nah!" LAUGHTER I had to show them ID... LAUGHTER ..to get in this photo. Listen, I take... we take the kids away quite a lot. We, er, we alternate between Butlin's and Center Parcs. That's our family flex. I don't know if you've been to either of those places, but Butlin's has got a lot more... WHISTLING Thank you very much. Whistling cos you've heard a word you recognise. Well done, good for you. Erm, any Center Parcs fans in? CHEERING Any Butlin's fans in? CHEERING Ooh, nice. If you've been to Center Parcs you will know, right, you have to book your accommodation. Then you've gotta book the activities that you want your kids to do. And the activities cost so much money. They cost shedloads of money. And I'm looking at these activities and I'm thinking, "I don't know what my kids wanna do in a few months' time." I don't know what they wanna do later on today. Right? Shall I ask them? Shall I get their help? Shall I see what they wanna do? And I look at one of my sons, and he's put his finger up his bum and he's asking his brother to smell it. So... LAUGHTER So... ..I don't think he can tell me whether I should book archery in June. I-I-I don't think he's got it in his locker. HE LAUGHS I mean, I did the Royal Variety Performance a few years ago, and I spoke very honestly about my children during that set, and I assumed that people knew I was just a comedian and I'm messing about. But, no, it turns out people took me seriously. Because I'll be out and about with my family, just trying to enjoy an afternoon with my wife and children. And someone will come up to us and go, "Which one's the moron, then? Is it this one? "Is it this one? Ha-ha-ha-ha! "You little moron, what's he crying for?" And that... LAUGHTER ..is very offensive, all right? Because... it's that one. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE 'Still ahead, 'incredible performances from The Kanneh-Masons 'plus Robbie Williams and Jamie Cullum.' CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Having made their Royal Variety debut in 2015 with The Play That Goes Wrong, Mischief Theatre have gone on to enjoy phenomenal global success. The Play That Goes Wrong, that sounds like a nightmare, doesn't it? Keep going wrong and that. No, it's supposed to go wrong. What, the play? Yeah, it's a play that goes wrong. Why do you want that? Because it's fun... it's part of the show that it goes wrong. But don't they do previews where they work it out, and any mistakes, they iron out for the run? No, they're not supposed to iron out mistakes. The whole thing is supposed to go wrong. So, how do you know if it's gone well? LAUGHTER When it's gone really wrong, I guess, a bit like this link. OK. All right, so tonight ahead of... That "tonight" was too big, wasn't it? THEY LAUGH That's like the beginning of the evening! BOTH: Tonight! Right, come on, do your gag. When's it out, then, Rob? This is the link that goes wrong. Oh, yeah, yeah, go on. They're lovin' it! Tonight, ahead of the opening at the Lowry Theatre in Salford next year, they're back with an extract from their latest comedy following a group of six-year-olds through school, adolescence and adulthood. So, please give it up for the cast of Grown Ups. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE XYLOPHONE MELODY CHIMES TEACHER: 'Settle down, please.

LAUGHTER This weekend, they came to visit me where I live with my au pair Francesca. She says I'm an enfant terrible. On Saturday, we went to see the dressage with the horses. Two of the horses are mine. LAUGHTER I'm a horse! Horses don't wear capes! I'm a clothes horse. LAUGHTER Daddy says I have to go to state school to learn to be equal with the poor.

LAUGHTER And that was my weekend. Hello, my name is Spencer. ALL: What did you do at the weekend, Spencer? This weekend... I did a poo. And it was massive! And it was stinky, and it was in the corridor! LAUGHTER And even though my mummy said I'd let myself down, I was still proud anyway. And I showed it to my daddy, and he said that even though he shouldn't be, he was impressed. LAUGHTER Spencer has to go for extra classes on Saturdays, because he is naughty. Miss Murray is teaching me our boundaries. For example, to play with our class hamster, you must not stroke our class hamster like this. LAUGHTER If you stroke him like this he could die. My uncle died of stroke. LAUGHTER That wasn't me! And that was my weekend. WEAKLY: Hello... Simon! Hello, my name is Simon. ALL: What did you do at the weekend, Simon?!

I need a drink. I'm Katie's dad. It's only 11! Don't I know it? Slam. And then the cleaner, Pam, came to visit. Katie, you must stay downstairs, because Pam and I need to clean the bedroom. Yes, Daddy. When Pam and Daddy clean the bedroom, they are very loud... because they cannot decide who should have the mop. Give it to me, Reg. LAUGHTER You want it? Oh, yes, give it to me. LAUGHTER You want it? Oh, yes, give it to me. Yes. Give it to me harder. LAUGHTER Take it, you kinky horse. You're so much dirtier than my wife. I'm filthy. That's it, put it there! Right there!

We are Flo & Joan. Yeah. We are sisters. Yeah. We have the same mum and dad. Mm-hm. One of the questions that we get asked the most is, "Are you really real sisters?" Lots of people's would say, "Because you don't look the same, are you sure you're real sisters?" So we've written them a song. MELODY PLAYS # Yes. # LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Yeah.

But even despite this, we went on holiday together recently to Disneyland, which was amazing because we're two adult women doing very well, and we're very happy, thank you. LAUGHTER Yeah, it was so cool. We got there and we were staying in one of their hotels. And the hotel guy, like, took us up to our room and was like, "We've put you in the Little Mermaid Suite. We were like, "That's amazing. That's the best film." And he opened the door, and in the middle of the room, there was middle a massive double bed shaped like a clown. We were like, "Oh, we think there's been a mistake. "We booked two single beds. We're single clown girls, here..." "..we don't want this." He was like, "No, no, no, it's OK. We've upgraded you. "Congratulations, Ms and Ms Dempsey." We were like, "Oh... Mm... "No, er... that's not... Oh, no. "No, we're sisters." And he was like, "It's OK, you can love who you love in Disneyland." LAUGHTER "We agree, we're very much on board with that. "Thank you for saying it out loud, "but we're not married, we don't do that stuff." And he was like, "OK, I won't tell Jafar." And he closed the door and he left. LAUGHTER And we were kind of a bit miffed that he refused to believe us, given that he lives in a world where he thinks his boss is a giant mouse. LAUGHTER But he thinks that we're lying to ourselves about sharing parents, so we came home and we wrote this song.
