[drum solo continues] [song ends] [screams] [audience cheering] Oh, Randy Hansen, ladies and gentlemen! [cheering] And the Sam Kinison Wedding Band. Thank you very much, guys. Oh, man! How the fuck are you, Las Vegas?! [cheering] I know a lot of you probably got scared. You probably thought, "Oh, fuck. He's not gonna sing all night, is he?" [laughs] I just wanted to show you a couple of things a lot of people didn't get to see, like most of the shit that was cut out of my Saturday Night Live show. As far as the voter registration commercial, I still haven't registered to vote. [laughs] So... I meant to. I meant to. It's those fucking hours, man. It's hard to get up and get down there in time to fucking, um... you know, register-- Where do you go, the Post Office? Where the fuck do you go? Shit, I don't know. Also, that was my new fucking video there on the end. It's called "Under My Thumb." [cheering] You people are the first fuckers to see it as is, man! [cheering] I sent it to MTV like that, and they had some fucking problem! I don't get it, man! I think it's fucking hot. I don't see any problem. I thought it was family entertainment. Everybody knows, this is what I stand for! Family entertainment. So they fucking ruined it, man. They took out all the fucking girls dancing. They took out all the fucking action, all the fucking strippers. And it looks like Ozzy Osbourne and all these guys are, like, clapping for the fucking band, man. So I sent them a telegram yesterday, and I said, "Pull my fucking video. If you're not gonna run the one I made, then get the one that you have on there off now. -Fuck you." -[cheering] So... So if you don't see it on there, folks... [laughs] And what we're gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to go back in the editing room and, you know, because the girls got carried away. I had nothing to do with it. But we did audition 127 professional stripper dancers, and they were on that runway and they got carried away! You know, some of them did take off their clothes and play with their pussies and stuff, so... I guess what I'm gonna have to do is go back in, re-edit the video, and show you everything and release it on a home video where you can fucking own it. -And, uh... -[cheering] There's also an R-rated version of "Wild Thing" that never was released because, you know, Jessica's tits was, like, falling out everywhere and, you know... 'Cause they're awful big now. [laughs] And we just hate that, don't we, guys?! Oh, we hate big titties. Yeah, sure. Oh, God! Oh, so much fun to be in Las Vegas. Now, I know... how many locals do we have here, first of all? [cheering] Well, thank you for coming out, supporting my show. There was a lot of fucking bad stories that went around about New Year's Eve... And, of course, I'm not gonna tell you the truth. 'Cause nobody else did, why should I fucking tell the truth? Fuck! No, here's what the problem was. Now, this is-- this was my fault. Let-- hey, hey. Let's don't have a fucking relapse, okay? Don't flash me back, all right? Here's what the problem was, is that I came on at New Year's fucking Eve. I came on at midnight. This was the biggest fucking mistake, next to my marriages, I've ever made in my fucking life. I should-- I wanted to take a pen-- "I suck dick so good. Show my your rings and I'll show you my tit rings." Okay, here. Whoo! Thank you! [laughs] Here. Okay, hurry! Uh-oh. [laughs] Hey, can I take a picture of yours now? Okay. Whoa! Thank you! [laughs] Well, you're just trying to help. That's all. You try to help. Yeah, take her to my room, please? Jesus Christ, she had tit rings, man. I thought I knew what fucking pain was. Fuck! That's gotta be some intense pain. How many women have tit rings in the audience? Is that Bill Gazzarri? Bill Gazzarri, ladies and gentlemen. The man you saw in my video! Bill! I told you, see, you were in-- did you see the video? See, you were in the real video. MTV fucked us, man. So I said fuck MTV, I pulled my video, man. 'Cause they took you-- Bill was the one that was introducing the strippers. Plus, anybody from Los Angeles, this is the man that started rock and roll! Bill Gazzarri! Gazzarri's of rock and roll! -[cheering] -The man, the legend, the myth! Did you ever fuck a girl with tit rings, Bill? I'm just curious. I just... Right here! Right here's your tit rings. All right... I draw a classy crowd, don't I? I tell ya. People come to Vegas, they go, "Wait, what? The Pointer Sisters show is sold out. Why don't we take the kids over to see that Sam Kinison show, honey? You know, that's gotta be plenty of family entertainment." Here's what went wrong, anyway. I just wanna get this New Year's Eve-- this New Year's Eve thing out of the way. Here's what happened. They brought me onstage, yes! It was New Year's Eve, I had partied a little. But there was nobody passing out on-fucking-stage, passing out backstage. That's fucking lie number one. Number two was that they brought me out right at fucking midnight, right? So I come out, they go, "Ladies and gentlemen, Sam Kinison!" Next thing I hear is, "Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... happy New Year!" So you see how many people here tonight. Everybody had a fucking horn, and was going... [imitates horn] "Happy New Year!" [imitates horn] It was like doing my fucking act in traffic, man. So I'm fucking buzzed out of my fucking mind, man. I'm holding onto speakers and shit, trying to do jokes with 2,500 fucking horns in my face. [imitates horn] "Happy New Year!" So anyway, to make up for that, to make up for that, because I love fucking Vegas, man. This town's always been good to me, I wanna be here when 19-fucking... when fucking 1999 goes into the year 2000, baby. I wanna be right here fucking rocking it in, man. Which is one of the reasons I had to stop doing coke. I know, I know. A lot of you are disappointed, going, "Fuck, Sam, we were hoping you were gonna OD with a couple of 16-year-olds." I'm sorry. Sorry to disappoint you. No, I had to. It was either give up the coke, or give up the heart. You know what I mean, folks? So... it's not a bad idea, though, seriously. I don't wanna get into an anti-drug thing, but if you're involved with coke, get fucking dis-involved with it because it's fucking illegal and, you know, you don't wanna go to jail, man. That's the bottom line. Don't go to jail, man. You don't wanna be next-- you don't wanna be next-door to Jim Baker going, "Oh! Oh, does this hurt or what?! [laughs] Oh, it wasn't worth it! It wasn't worth the buzz! Jesus God! Get this dick out of my ass!" You know... Oh, people were killing me with that fucking shit, man. I would go to fucking parties and for some reason, because they think you're in show business, they think you can do supernatural amounts of fucking drugs. A normal guy goes to a party, like, "Hey, man. We're doing coke. Let me cut you a line." [squeaks] It's about an inch long. I go into parties, "Oh! It's Kinison, oh! Ohhh! Here's your line." [squeaking] "Go! Go! Go! Go!" You know... So... I'm a dumb-ass, right? I feel like I gotta do this. I gotta prove who I am, you know. I'm snorting these foot-long fucking lines of coke. Yeah. Yeah, it's a lot of fun, 'cause now I'm walking around the party for the next four hours going, "Thanks!" [tapping] [laughs] "I don't wanna bring the party down, but I can't move my left arm and there's a ringing in my ear and, uh... You know, I'm... anybody got any downers? I'll drink shoe polish, anything! Just... something that'll stop this fucking heart! Don't stop it! Just slow it down, God, please!" You know, so... So, anyway, since March 2nd, this is my 80... I think it's 85 days that I haven't had any shit. [cheering] Hopefully, we'll be around a long time. Oh... so... Well, I love you too, man. I just wanna be alive to make you laugh, man. That's all. [cheering] Now, this... this thing about the gay community. Let's get this fucking shit out of the way. Now, I know I offended the gays on these last two albums that I did. They said I was in bad taste. They said my jokes were in bad taste. These are guys.... these are guys that lick the shit out of each other's ass... on a fucking date, telling me my jokes are in bad taste. Now, am I missing something here? These guys tongue-fuck each other in the butt for an hour and a half, but you put on a Kinison album, and they can't fucking handle it. It's like... [gagging] You know. They can suck a dick this long, but I fucking gag them. I make them fucking... [gags] You know. Insensitive! They called me insensitive! These are guys that put gerbils and hamsters up their ass! [cheering] Insensitive! How sensitive-- how sensitive can you be if you're putting a live animal in your fucking ass? Jesus fucking Christ, man! I'm insensitive! Yeah, yeah, I'm an animal. I'm out of fucking control. These guys are walking around with... [squeaking] ...coming out of their butts. Fucking little tails twirling around when these fucking animals are suffocating in their asshole. And I'm fucking psycho, yeah. Watch me. Ban my fucking records 'cause I'm out of control. Oh! Now, I just-- seriously. Let me ask you something, because this has been going around, and I just want to see if everybody's part of this. -[man shouts] -Exactly. Has everybody heard the shit about Richard Gere? [cheering] Dude, that's fucking intense, man. How many people have heard about Richard Gere -having a gerbil in his ass? -[cheering] I swear to God, it may be a rumor, I hope it's a rumor. [laughs] I was in Miami last night, the fucking crowd there went nuts. I'm going, shit, everybody in the country knows, supposedly, 'cause I don't wanna get in trouble... [high-pitched squeal] But, supposedly, supposedly I guess he was in the hospital... Mark, you would probably know, is this for real? You're a doctor in LA. It is for real? He had a gerbil in his fucking ass? Two of them? [laughs] I can't believe it. How good can this fucking feel?! Man, I have been drunk, folks. I have been drunk and coked up and fucked up to where I have pissed in my suitcase thinking it was the toilet. To where I lifted the lid of my suitcase and just fucking pissed, man. "Oh... Oh..." Soaked down a 500-dollar fucking red satin robe. Half a suitcase full of my fucking piss. You know? It never occurred to me to put a rodent in my fucking intestinal tract. For a fucking buzz, man! This doctor had to feel fucking weird, man. He's going, "Richard, uh, I'm a big fan of your work. I enjoy all your movies, I just saw Pretty Woman, and, uh... but there's a gerbil in your ass. [laughs]" And then the gerbil must have had a great look on his face. "Oh, yeah, it's my fault! Oh, yeah, blame me! It was my fucking idea! This is where I wanted to spend the vacation, in this guy's ass! Yeah, I'm the fucking asshole!" Fucking poor gerbils, man. Nobody's doing nothing about it. Nobody gives a shit. You know why? 'Cause they're rodents. People fucking hate rodents. They do, they hate rats, they hate mice, they hate fucking rodents. Now, if they were dolphins... if gays were putting dolphins up their fucking ass, oh! Oh, would you have a fucking war going on. Every fucking ecology group would be going down to all these college people, everybody, Save the Whales organizations, "What? They're putting dolphins up gays' asses? Oh, save the dolphins!" What about the fucking gerbils, man?! It's too late for 'em in California. You know, you can't even find a gerbil or a hamster in California. They're gone. They're extinct. They're right up there with the fucking American bald eagle. They're gone. You've gotta go as far as three, four, five states fucking east to try and find a fucking gerbil or a hamster. These fucking fags in LA and in San Francisco have used them all up. They're dead. They're dead! Nobody cares. In San Francisco, they're down to shaved squirrels and lab mice, that's what they're down to. See, I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't know what The Pet Shop Boys were about. I didn't know! I thought it was a weird name for a fucking band! I thought, "What a stupid name to call your band, The Pet Shop Boys." Why would you call your band The fucking Pet Shop Boys? I thought, I understand Aerosmith, I understand fucking Bon Jovi, I understand Skid Row, I understand... you know what I mean? I understand Guns N' Roses. You'd call your band Guns N' Roses, right? Why would you call your band The fucking Pet Shop Boys? And then I realized the dark truth: that's where they have to go to buy the animals that they put in their ass, the pet shop! It's a secret gay code word saying that "we put animals in our ass, and we sing Elvis songs!" They do, man. They sing fucking Elvis songs with gerbils in their ass, man. Nobody gives a fuck. There's no fucking protest. Nothing... you know. Nobody gives a fuck, man. I'm just glad Elvis is dead, thank God. Thank God Elvis is dead. 'Cause if he wasn't, he would be so fucking pissed off, man. He'd be in Graceland going, "What are you trying to say, man? Are you trying to tell me that there's bands out there putting animals in their ass singing my songs? I don't understand it, man. Talk to me about it. Tell me all about it. You mean they walk out there with an animal in their ass and they go... ♪ Wise men say " [squeaking] "♪ Only fools rush in " [squeaking] Thank God he's dead! Thank God he's not alive to know this. Oh, fuck. I don't fucking get it, man. Okay, call me a square. I... Animals in the ass. I don't fucking get it, man. Oh, yeah, sick humor. It gets a lot sicker, folks. This is the fucking family entertainment part of the show. [cheering] I have a friend... I have a friend that I never do a show in Vegas without because I believe this man justifies and represents a great cause: the kids that Jerry forgot. You heard him on my album, he's become his own little celebrity, he's a man that hates Jerry Lewis. I know this is Jerry's town. I know they do the telethon here. But this man is one bitter, little fucking bastard in a wheelchair that wants Jerry Lewis' ass. He wants to beat him, he wants to bite his dick off, he wants to gnaw on his balls There's not a lot-- he's in a wheelchair. There's not a lot he can actually do to Jerry, but if he was around his dick and balls, he could fucking gnaw on it. [growling] Like a fucking mad dog. [growling] I wanna bring him out right now, 'cause he's one of my friends for a couple of years, he's a very funny kid, I love him, he makes Vegas an event for me, Mr. Doug Beattie! Bring him out, girls! -Doug Beattie! -[cheering] Whoo! Oh, goddamn, with the hottest fucking nurses in Vegas. Not to mention, ladies and gentlemen, this is Malika and Sabrina! Whoo! Hello. So, Doug... Doug, I just want to introduce you to the people that may not know you. This is Doug Beattie. How do you feel about Jerry Lewis, Doug? I hate that son of a bitch. He's been doing this goddamn telethon for 30 years now? Made a couple billion dollars. I haven't seen dime one. You haven't seen one fucking dime. How old are you now? -Twenty-five. -Twenty-five fucking years old. Have you ever been asked to be the poster boy? Never. They wouldn't give me anything. Fucking sons of fucking cunt bitches, man. I hate 'em. I hate that bastard. I want his ass! [laughs] Don't get up. Don't get up! Don't get up! Hold him, hold him! He gets excited, man. Fuck, he starts flying around the room and pissing on people, man, it's not pretty. Dude, so you're having fun. It's fun. Well, listen, you know, I've tried to help, you know that. I've taken Dougie under my wing, I like to call him Sammy's kid. And I'd like to challenge any of Jerry's Kids to take him on. He could beat any of Jerry's Kids' fucking asses. I'll beat your fucking asses, man! I got 'em all, I'll get 'em! You can take on Jerry's type of kids, couldn't you? Yeah! I'll kick his fucking ass! [Sam laughs] I'm sorry, folks. I love this fucking shit. I would love to see that, but fuck the Incredible Hulk, you know what I mean? Fuck the Hulk, and the fucking big boss man. I'd like to see you take on one of Jerry's Kids and beat his fucking ass, wheelchair for wheelchair. I'll do it, man. Any time, any place. Anywhere! How much money did they raise? How much money do they raise -every year on this telethon? -Thirty, 40 million a year. -And there's no cure? -Nothing! There's nothing! I haven't seen a fucking thing. The cash or the fucking cure, Jerry. So, what you're saying is you'd rather have the cash or the cure? If they're not gonna give you the cure, at least give you a little cash to party on while you're waiting on the fucking cure, right? Yeah! Let me party, have some fun, you know? That makes sense. So what have I done for you? Tell them what I've done for you. Oh, he's been great. Took me out to XXX, got my dick sucked, we party, you know? That's right. Hey, that's all right... [laughs] I've got him special medication. -Only the best. -[laughs] Hey, man, fuck it, man! The guy deserves to party! Don't you think so?! Fucking sit around for some mythical cure, drink it! Doug Beattie, ladies and gentlemen! A man who challenges Jerry's fucking Kids! All right, girls. You, you tight fucking nasty bitches. Jesus God. [laughs] Now, that would be a pay-per-view event. Doug Beattie takes on any of Jerry's fucking Kids. He's fucked up, he's in a wheelchair. Come on, come on! I'll fucking promote it, I'll promote his fucking fight, man. Oh, he hates Jerry Lewis, man. I know, half the people are laughing, the other half's going, "What kind of fucking jokes are these? Jesus God, this is the sickest fucking comedy I've ever seen." Well, it was either this, or Jay Leno, folks. I think you made the right move, myself. -[cheering] -[laughs] Where else are you gonna see a kid in a wheelchair-- I think he's got a fucking valid complaint, man. If I was fucked up and I was in a wheelchair, I'd go, "Fuck it. If there's no cure, give me some money to where I could get my dick sucked, to where I could take some fucking ten-milligram Valiums all day and have some fucking beer, and wait for the fucking cure!" What is wrong with that? I think it's either the cash or the cure! Is he even in charge of the telethon anymore? -[woman shouts] -Not this time? Well, fuck, I wonder if I could take it over. I wonder if they'd let me. I wonder if-- yeah. Sam Kinison. Sam Kinison takes over the fucking telethon. That would help. Sammy's Kids. Oh, I'd get 'em fucked up, man. I'd help 'em out. I'd get 'em the right medication. [laughs] Oh, God. I'm having so much fun. It's so good to be back at Bally's, man. I'm telling you, man. I'm having a blast. Got a lot of surprises. Oh... it's great to be fucking straight. Well, it's all right. Yeah. I still do amyl nitrate. That's my favorite fucking... That's the best. That's one of the reasons I come to Vegas, you can buy it here. If you haven't bought any, go to an adult bookstore, there's a great one right down the fucking street here on the Strip, it's right, like, in this little mall. I don't know the name of it, but it's like big fucking bright lights, adult arcade, this woman... this girl knows. What is it? Which one is it? -[woman shouts] -What is it? The General Store? They sell amyl nitrate? They don't have poppers by any chance, do they? -[cheering] -Oh, dude! Dude, if I could get some poppers, I would be such a happy man. For you people that don't know what I'm talking about, I'm serious. I know I've pushed this before. Seriously, while you can, get a bottle of amyl nitrate because I don't know how much longer it'll be legal enough to buy, but get a bottle of this, and have sex on this stuff. It is the best! It is the best sex you will ever have in your life! You've never fucked like this in your life. It's the best stuff, man. Now, the reason why it's not completely legal is that there's a little sign on the bottle that says, "Do not inhale." Now, what that means is... you know, don't believe everything you fucking read, folks. What that means is... don't drink the fucking shit. 'Cause if you do, well, you know, you'll fucking grow horns out your ass and you'll be the first centaur on your block. [roaring] You know... [laughs] Get some of this stuff, man, smell it... There is a little cardiovascular damage to the heart. A little! You fucking babies. There's a little, that's all! It's not a lot! It's just a little fucking cardiovascular damage and it doesn't bother you now. It takes years off of your life later on, when you're ready to fucking die. When you're over 80 years old, you're going, "You know, I've had enough time here, I've had enough... I've had enough fun, I'm ready to lay down." My theory about life is, if it hurts to pee, it's time to die. That's my fucking theory on life. -[cheering] -I swear to God, I was right here at Bally's, New Year's Eve, around that time, I went in the men's room, and this kills me because Bally's is great. Killer casino, very pretty, gorgeous. But you go in the fucking men's room, it's like any other fucking men's room, you've got that open fucking piss trough like you're in Dodge City. You know I mean? Like you're cattle barons. Seriously, man! Like we're fucking cattle. And women don't understand. It's hard to pee when there's other guys around you! You can go in there and just be beating your fucking knees together, going, "God, I gotta piss." You go in, here's an open fucking piss trough... I'm sorry, man, I hate to do this joke right in front of your face 'cause it looks like you're the piss trough, but there's an open fucking piss trough, and... Guys, am I telling the truth? You sit there, you've gotta pee, and you look over and there's all these guys and the fucking dick will not work, man. You can't pee. You're sitting there going... [grunting] [laughs] You women don't fucking understand. You got your little fucking booths and your little latch, your privacy. Your toilet paper's folded to a little point. You know, we're treated-- I'd like to see you fucking women go in a bathroom and all this is an open trench that you have to stick your butt over and take a piss or... "Hi! Hey, how you doing? Boy, the comedian's really funny, isn't he?" [imitating urination] Then you'd understand what I'm talking about. So anyway, I'm in there, right? I'm taking a piss. This old guy comes in, he has to be 80 years old. The guy grabs the wall. He grabs the fucking wall. And he goes... [groans] [groaning] I'm sitting there going, "Jesus!" It's not like they're pulling a sword out of his ass. And all the guy's doing is taking a piss. All he is doing is taking a piss! It's like he's in pain. He's like... [groans] "Oh, God!" I'm sitting there going, "God, if I'm ever that old, if it hurts to fucking pee, it's time to die." I think the Indians knew this. I do. I think the Indians knew it. I think the Indians went, "Uh-oh. Pee-pee hurt. Time to die. Time to go to the great mountain and sit in the circle of great men." Oh... un-fucking-believable, man. Get a bottle of this stuff, you won't have to worry about it. You won't live that long. You'll check out of here late sixties, early seventies. It is the best stuff. I wouldn't lie to you. Not three times in a row, not right in your face. Is it? Have you ever had sex on it? It's great, isn't it? Who am I talking to? You? Darling, isn't it-- oh, dude. Is it the best, man? You get a little bottle... I'll tell you the best thing about it. All right? You keep it on the nightstand next to your bed. You're fucking your woman... I hope it's a woman. I hope you're not doing that fucking drunk buddy fucking bullshit, man. Jesus Christ! That's what cowboys used to do, you know? Out here in the Old West. Yeah, what they used to do, you'd have a fucking bottle of whiskey, they'd sit around the campfire, and keep drinking and go, "Whoever passes out first gets fucked. You just go right ahead, mister, I can hold my liquor." [laughs] I swear to God, man. Anyway, try to make it a fucking woman if you can. All right? You're making love to your woman, you've had your sex, you've had fun, it's been fucking fun, it's been exciting, you reach over and you grab the little bottle and you take the top off... [sniffs] You smell it. All right? While you're still inside her. You smell it. [sniffs] And then you offer it to her and if she says, "What's that?" Oh! Oh! Those are magical words. Aren't they? My God, that is the closest thing to a virgin many of us will come to in life. If she says those magical words, "What's that?" It's like, it's the same situation when you... when you finally have to ask the girl if you are the biggest cock that she's ever had. You guys know what I'm talking about. Don't fucking give me that look, we all wanna know. Come on, man. This is 19-fucking-90. You know women sleep around. They slept around before you. And every guy has to ask that fucking question. You know that. Eventually. I don't care how long you go with a woman, eventually you have to go, "Listen, honey. I'm just kind of curious. Uh... Am I the, uh... Let's see, how can I put this? Uh... Have you ever had anybody that was like, uh... b-b-b-b-b... uh... Anybody that was [stammers] bigger than me?" Now, girls, the correct answer is... [high-pitched squeal] "Bigger than you?! You mean they make them bigger than you?!" Oh! Oh! Oh, that's the fucking correct answer! That'll get you a fucking diamond ring, ladies! That will get you a fucking diamond ring. That'll get you that bracelet and necklace. But a lot of guys don't get that fucking answer! A lot of guys get the answer's like, "Well, yeah, there was this one guy," and you go... Oh... Yeah, that's the worst. Oh, don't fucking laugh, Jeremy. Fuck you, you asshole. Ron fucking Jeremy, ladies and gentlemen, over in the corner. [laughs] A man with possibly the biggest dick in the fucking world. Smart-ass! You fucking son of a bitch! Fuck you! Well, at least that fucking John Holmes is dead. Fuck his fucking ass. I'm glad he's dead. God, was he a pain in the ass or what? Remember John Holmes? The guy with the biggest fucking cock in the fucking world. I'm so glad that son of a bitch is fucking dead! We hate guys with big dicks! Don't we, guys?! -Do we hate 'em?! -[cheering] You may not get out of here alive, Ron. [laughs] No, Ron's all right. John Holmes used to piss me off. Because girls would fucking, of course, see these videos with this guy with this fucking dick that looked like... it was from a fucking 'nother planet. You know? It looked like he beat off around radioactive material when he was a kid. He looked like he had the dick of the 50-foot fucking one-eyed cyclops or something. [roaring] And girls would always give you that shit, man, you know. The girls, you know, they'd see that video and they go... [gasps] "Honey, how come your dick's not like that?" It's like, "I don't know. I don't know, honey. I guess I didn't live close enough to a fucking plutonium plant. Maybe that was it. I'll tell you what, the next time I'm around some radioactive material, I'll take out my dick and balls and rub it all over it. Maybe I'll mutate into a larger cock. Maybe that'll make you fucking happy, you fucking bitch." Oh... you guys know what I'm talking about. This is a guy's fucking act. I love women too. Shit, what are you gonna do? Get a bottle of this fucking stuff. We're back on the bottle, all right? If she says, "What is that?" you go, "Hey, just trust me. Come on. Just smell it." Give her a little whiff. Let her smell it. Then you take it back, you smell it again, you put the top back on it, very tightly. 'Cause you don't want the stuff to fucking spill, man. Put it on the fucking nightstand, and then fuck, man! I mean-- is this the best? It's the fucking best sex. You fuck like you're Zor, fucking from the 15th century! [roaring] Oh! Oh, you tear this pussy up! You tear the pussy fucking up, ladies and gentlemen! And you know what the best thing is? You shoot! You shoot! I know a lot of guys go, "What? What, you shoot?" Yes! Hard to believe as it is, men our age shoot! It's not that Heinz 57 fucking shit. [blows raspberry] [groans] "It's coming, it's coming. Hold on." [groans] No. No, you use amyl nitrate, man, you fucking shoot. You hit her in the fucking face, over her fucking shoulder. Sometimes you miss her head completely and hit the fucking pillow. You wanna keep a tape measure next to your bed just so you can measure it. "Oh, my God! My God! Twenty-two fucking inches! Look at that! Honey, it's a new record!" [laughs] Plus, if you're in a hotel, it sounds great next door. 'Cause you're fucking, people next door go, "What? Did you hear what I heard? Something about 22 fucking inches. Did you hear that? Jesus Christ!" Oh, listen, I wanna talk to you about something that's a new part of my life. Something that I've been recently doing. Yeah, sobriety, yeah. We covered that. Uh, I think, and I'm gonna get a little heat on this, but go with me on this for a second, guys. I think it's time that as men and as gentlemen that we shouldn't come in women's mouths anymore. I think it's rude-- Oh, I knew it, I knew it! Oh, yeah! Turn on me! You fucking traitors! Goddamn you! Here I try to be polite, I try to do a fucking gentlemanly gesture... I just think it's rude, man. I think it's so fucking rude to just blow a load in a woman's mouth. No warning, don't tell her. Maybe it doesn't bother you guys. -Does it bother you guys? -[men] No! Well, it bothers me. Maybe you can handle it. I'm sitting there and a girl's blowing me, and, you know, when I hear her make that noise, she goes... [gags] [gagging] That fucking gets to me, man. And they always do it like that. I have yet to see a girl go, "Oh, eat 'em up! Yum, yum, eat 'em up! Yum, yum!" It's always that fucking... [gagging] You know. It's always those kind of fucking noises. The fucking eyes-- their eyes, the water fucking builds up in their eye, the little tear comes down their face from the pressure in their face. And guys won't tell you. You know that, ladies. Guys won't tell you when they're coming. They won't tell you. You're blowing them, you're sucking their dick, and all of a sudden, they're jerking, they're fucking trembling, their tensing up, their fucking lip's acting like Billy Idol's, you know. They're doing all this shit. And the girl's like, [muffled] "Hey, are you okay? Is everything all right, honey?" The guy's like, "Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine, honey. Everything's fine. Just keep sucking." And you're sucking, all of a sudden you feel his hand on the back of your head and you're going, "What's this? Oh, I can't get out!" [gagging] So fucking rude! Oh! Oh, it's fucking rude! [laughs] Oh, it's so rude, man. How many women, seriously, let me ask you, how many women think guys should not come in your mouth? -How many women? -[cheering] Okay, wait, all right. We're gonna give a chance to the opposing view. How many women say, "Well, Sam, if I love my man, I'll do anything for him, I'll even swallow for him." How many women will swallow for their man? [cheering] Whoo! Well, then let me recreate-- let me fucking, uh... apologize for the first part of this bit. I was wrong, obviously. How many women will swallow for the man they love? [cheering] Goddamn! This is Vegas. The 24-hour swallow town. So I guess basically this is like the swallow capital of fucking Nevada! Is that what you're telling me? [cheering] That should be the fucking commercial here. [gurgling] "Hello, welcome to Las Vegas, home of the swallow." This must have been where they came up with-- This must have been where 7-Eleven came up with that Big Gulp idea, huh? The Big Gulp campaign, Bill. It had to be fucking invented right here. There was probably a 7-Eleven convention right here in Vegas. Somebody was blowing going... [gagging] And the guy went, "Wait a second. I think I know how to sell that 32-ounce fucking drink for 7-Eleven. We call it the Big Gulp." Oh, come on! Yeah, like the Slurpee didn't have a double innuendo to it. -Huh? -[cheering] [laughs] Oh, God, the Slurpee. [laughs] I'm sorry, folks, I crack myself up on time to time. I enjoy my work so much that I laugh at my own material sometimes. Oh... are you having any fun, Las Vegas?! -[cheering] -Whoa! Yes! Okay, I think you know what time it is. It's time to make the phone call. Yes. It's time that we find some fucking poor, tormented, sick fucking bastard in the audience. Look at you, ouch. Okay, guy. You may wanna use 'ludes later, you know? 'Cause how can they say no if they can't even form words? "Honey, you mind if I fuck you in the ass?" [groaning] "Sounds like yes to me." [squeals] "Can my friends fuck you too?" [groaning] "Come on, guys! Come on! She wants to party!" [laughs] Oh, no, if you haven't heard my new album, it's called Leader of the Band. I do a thing on it that I've done at my shows, where I try to find a guy in the audience that has a story that is so fucking tormented, that is about a man that went through hell, and we like-- matter of fact, I recorded my album right here in this fucking room. Leader of the Band was recorded here at Bally's. You think I'm sucking enough Bally's dick tonight? Oh! [muffled] I love Bally's! I love Bally's! All right. But what I want is I want a man with a story about a bitch who broke his heart, and you must have the phone number and the audience must agree that this fucking bitch deserves us to call her up and kick her fucking ass over the phone! -You must agree! -[cheering] I need a man with a story. You got a story, sir? What's your name? Everybody's pointing at you. Oh, what's your name, man? John? I'm glad you dressed up for the show, John. It's all right. Out of town, huh? All right. Oh, cool, dude. No, I'm teasing. I know, you look local. You look like you just got off work, though you'd come by and catch the Kinison show. Good move. So what's the girl's name, what'd she do to you? [inaudible] Becky? What did Becky do to you? -Fucked me over good. -Well, yeah. But I mean, was there a particular incident or...? Are you on medication right now, man? [laughs] -Hey, dude, thanks. -[inaudible] Well, thanks, man. Pleasure to meet you, dude. All right. Three years of fucking hell, man. Three years of hell? All right. You're our first contender. We need another story. We need a man that has another story! All right, guy, talk to me! Right over here! Talk to me! What's your name? Jerry? How you doing, man? All right, what's the girl's name? -Kim. -Kim? What did Kim do to you? I was in the Coast Guard, I thought I was in love... [inaudible] Whoa! That's pretty good! That's pretty fucking rude! Contender number two, we got a man here with his hand up, what's your name, sir? -Dave. -All right, Dave. What's your problem, what'd a girl do to you? I went into work and I caught my girlfriend -fucking my boss. -Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! That's fucking rude. Are you serious? Your bitch was fucking your fucking boss? Do you still have your job? [laughs] I didn't think so. What a cunt, man. Which one should we call, audience? You wanna go with the one that fucked his boss? [cheering] Dude, will you help me make the call? I think he should fucking make the call with me! -[cheering] -All right, wait a second, Dave. All right, thanks, guys. Thanks a lot. Bring me the phone, bitches! Bring me the fucking phone! Come on up here, Dave. Bill, get Dave. Bring him on up here. Nice pants if you work for Ziegfeld and Roy. That's a pretty hot outfit. All right, so... Jesus Christ, where did you get these fucking boots, dude? Ah, oh-- my God! Fuck you! Jesus Christ! [laughs] Whoo! Oh, man. I love you girls so fucking much. Goddamn. Hey, by the way, do you guys think girls should swallow? Hey, hey, hey! All right. Well, we asked everybody else. Okay, Dave, here's what I'm gonna do. First of all, give, uh... who's gonna give-- Do we have some, Bill? Gavin? We need somebody to get the phone number. You can give it to the girls. Here's what I wanna do. Have you ever seen me do this bit? You know what I'm talking about? -Yeah, I think so. -Here's what I wanna do. I wanna coach you. I'll talk to her first, and I'll make sure it's her. What's her name? -Liz. -Liz, okay. I'm gonna-- We're gonna get Liz on the phone if she's home, I'm gonna call her up, I'm gonna say, "Hey, this is Sam Kinison. I'm here with a guy named Dave. And he says that when you were his girlfriend, that something went on with-- with you-- -with his boss and you." Okay? -Okay. At that point, I'm gonna give the phone to you, and I want you to call her every fucking thing you can think of, man. I want you to be Sam Kinison. 'Cause I've done it. I can do it. But it's not as fun if I fucking do it. If you need any help, I'll take the phone from you. But what I would like you to do is I'd like you to grab the phone and just go, "Hey, yeah! You're a fucking cunt! And I'm here with 3,000 people, and they all know you're a whore!" -Here, give it a chance. -Okay. Okay. -[line ringing] -Act like this is the phone and like you're doing it right now. Okay. -Liz, here he is. -You fucking bitch! I walked in on you screwing my boss! -I hate your fucking guts! -That's not bad. -A little more pain... -[woman] Hello? Hello? -Do we have her on the phone? -Hello? -Shit! Hello? -Hello? -Uh, is this Liz? -Yes, this is she. -[cheering] -[laughs] -Hi, Liz! -Hello? -This is Sam Kinison. -Who? Yeah, Sam Kinison. I'm a comedian. I'm down at Bally's and we're having fun. -You're kidding. -No, and, uh, you're kind of the winner of a special prize. Do we like Liz, ladies and gentlemen? [audience] No! Liz, we got somebody here-- do you remember that show, Liz, -This is Your Life? -Yes? Well, this is a kind of a fun version of that show, This is Your Life. We have a guy here that says that when you were is girlfriend, that he caught you, uh, well, I'll let him tell you, okay? See if you recognize his voice. Yeah, Liz? This is Dave. -What do you want? -Oh, what do I want? -Go! -What do I want? What about what I walked in to the inventory room and you were fucking Mike, my boss, on a box of socks, you fucking whore! I bought you fucking jewelry! I bought you boots! You're a fucking cunt! -You deserve to die! -You fucking bitch! How do you live with yourself, you fucking pussy! I hope your pussy... [inaudible] Go to hell and burn, bitch! -Suck my fucking dick-- -You fucking bitch! -Suck it-- -Bitch! Fuck you! Hang it up! All right! Good fucking work, Dave! Good work! Yes! Yes! Whoo! Follow the girls, Dave. Follow the fucking girls. Another hand for Dave, ladies and gentlemen! [cheering] Whoo! Well, I'm sure we won't get sued for that. Ah, yeah, bring out the piano. I tell you, a moment like that's pretty romantic, isn't it? When you hear lovers talk. Oh, this is great. Who do I give this mike to? This is so cool. I'm giving you guys a fucking show tonight, man. I'm making up for New Year's Eve, all right? [cheering] Ah, yeah, I haven't done this in a long fucking time, man. Ah, that was too fucking funny. This goes out to Liz. [playing piano] Boy, you know, when you hear lovers talk like that... when you hear that special romantic tone... it just-- it reminds me of my own wife. I think every guy here has had that kind of girl. Of course, I never caught mine fucking my boss. But... on a box of socks? That makes sense, though, it would be soft. It'd probably be, you know... He must be backstage right now just fucking reliving the whole fucking thing, man. [laughs] Anyway, this is, uh... this is what we call the romantic blues part of the show here. And I used to do this bit on my first album, it was called Louder Than Hell. And I wrote a love song. And it was about people that, uh, you know, that started out being in love, but they ran out of cash. You know what I'm talking about. I mean, money kicks people's ass, man. It's hard to be in love and not have any fucking money. And I hate to reduce it to that, but it's so fucking true. And I had a girl once, her name was Kate. And, uh, we're going back a few years. But she was, like, one of the great loves of my life. And I remember when I first got into show business, we were, uh... we were both gonna move to Los Angeles and I was gonna try and make it as a standup comic and then she found out I was broke. And she came to me one day and she started talking to me, she said, "Sam, you know, uh... things aren't the same. There's something missing." I said, "What the fuck's that? The cash?" She said, "No, it's just the love, just the passion. It just doesn't feel the same anymore." Well, that was basically how I felt. I thought, how do you put bullshit into a song and still make it romantic? Because a lot of people think love songs should go something like... ♪ This time you almost made ♪ The pieces fit ♪ Bullshit See, it doesn't work that way. But there is a great fucking old-time fucking love song, and this goes out to fucking Liz and it goes out to every guy that's ever had a fucking bitch break their fucking heart! Guys! One, two, one, two, three, four! [rock music plays] Yeah!
