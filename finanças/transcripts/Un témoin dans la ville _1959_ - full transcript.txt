No! Pierre, no! No! Pierre! Pierre! No! No! Gentlemen... Monsieur Verdier, My investigation is concluded I just signed an order in your favor, not proceed Your Honour, I'm glad my client's innocence has been recognized He has always lead a decent and righteous life. Could this really be the face of a murderer?! Nobody, sir, has the face of a murderer... until proven otherwise. You are free to go. "Free"!... The dismissal of charges is quite final, Mr Verdier. So I don't see the point of this little play-acting. The facts have been fully established... that you wanted to break up with your mistress. So if you don't mind, don't overdo it. Your honour... please! Excuse me, Mr Attorney... but this dismissal is not a question of "benefit of the doubt. " Doubt usually being your most effective collaborator. Can we have a word sir? Congratulations. Congratulations. Radiator smashed, steering skewed. - Couldn't you see properly? - I saw your car alright... But I tried to miss the dog... I'm sorry. Me too. We'll need to get the police. I accept full responsibility. I'll give you my name, and details of my insurer. Here. Could I trouble you to give me a hand? I'll have no car for a week. Same for me, and that's really bad news. Well, you asked for it. No sign of a taxi, of course. Even if there were, it'd be going back to Levallois. I live at Porte Dor?e. The subway's near here. With a bit of luck... What were you saying? - There's still the subway. - No... no way. - I'll bid you good night then. Good night. Honestly, I had to try and miss that dog. If it happened again, I'd do the same. I hope that doesn't find me on the same road. Damn! Damn! Radio Taxi. Could you send me a cab to 14 Rue Saint-Claude? What's your number? Sablons 3015 Hold the line please. Thanks Hullo? Hullo, Sablons 3015? Hullo? Hullo? Are you still there? Yes, I'm listening. It will be at least 10 minutes. That'll do, thanks. Ancelin, it's you. I know it's you. No need to play silly games. Ancelin! You broke into my house, Ancelin... like a burglar... I could rightly kill you. You're the one who's going to die. Executed for the murder of Jeanne Ancelin, my wife. You're insane, Ancelin. I'm innocent, and you know it. The whole world knows it. My case was dismissed. It wasn't dismissed for me. I warn you, you'd be the prime suspect. You'd be arrested straight away. I don't think so. I've had time to think it through... Months of thinking of nothing else. You would have been seen coming in. What about the servants? You think about them? I only have to ring. No use. And it's Thursday... And Thursday... no servants. Give me your gun... Come on! I'll yell... I'll call for help. The neighbours will come. The rich don't have any neighbors... They only have trees. Listen... I beg of you... Don't shoot. I'm not going to shoot you. You're going to commit suicide. You'll kill yourself, because life without Jeanne is impossible. Isn't that what you told the reporters? - I planned everything. - You're sure to have missed something. There's no such thing as a perfect crime. Speak for yourself. You never thought there'd be somebody dumb enough to avenge the wife who deceived him. They do exist. You haven't much time to get that into your head. Listen, Ancelin, you don't know the whole truth. You're telling yourself silly stories. Let me explain... You believe I grew tired of her... but quite the opposite was true. She'd had enough. She was in love with you, Ancelin. No one else but you. By the time she realised it, it was too late. She knew you'd never take her back. Even if she'd come back, you'd never have forgiven her. There's just no pity in you. You are hard, stubborn, insensitive... Jeanne understood that. It was all finished for her. There was nothing left to hope for. You have to believe me. She killed herself because of you. Is that it?... Have you run out of ideas? You disgust me. I swear I'm telling the truth. You're totally obsessed... Loneliness has warped your mind. That's enough! Stop! I was starting to get worried. Aren't you the one who phoned? Hey... what do you think you're doing? There's already 400 francs to pay! Hullo... Liliane? You must have screwed up. It's not the right address. Just a sec, I'll check. Hi there... You coming? - That won't work. - I don't have the right touch. It's the dress that doesn't do it for you. You look like a married woman. If I don't wear a tight-fitting dress, I don't make a red cent. And you've got to learn to smile... Put on a face for the customers. They come here to escape. - Isn't that true, handsome? - You coming or not. At least you know what you want! How much? How much? -3,000 - OK - This way. - No... I'm taking you. I don't want to go away... I'll waste my evening. -5,000 - OK... is your place far? - You'll see. - More trekking. Isn't half cold out there. - Ancelin here? - Don't worry, he will be. By 10. Wanna bet? 3 minutes to go. At 10 sharp the door opens... On the sweet face of our dear leader and guaranteed arsehole. - When you've been through what he has... - I don't see the connection. - I know. - Meaning what? Take it easy... You don't know Ancelin, that's all. - And I suppose YOU do? - A bit, yes. - He's a good guy. - News to me. You know what a groggy boxer's like? The sort who didn't go down... and is being belted where he stands. The sort that stays cracked all his life. He's late. 'Evening, gents! Hi, Pierre. Greetings, gramps. - Mr Ancelin... - All OK, kid? - Finish your coffee. - It's finished. - Want a cup? - No. Do you have the form? Ciao! - You can go to bed. - I gotta lock up. Good night, grandpa! Listen, Pierrot, I can't go with you. - What? - I have to stay in Paris. Tell the boss any excuse. It doesn't matter what. I had some errands to do... Why are you staring like that? Nothing... nothing at all. So what am I gonna tell the boss? Use your imagination. I'll cook up something on the way. Good... well, I'm off. - Don't knock yourself out. - Thanks. Have a good trip. - Listen... - Yes? Nothing... all's well. Now we can get back to it. Are we there? This isn't going to be pleasant. - You're so kind! - Good night. Hey! Don't you want anything more? Gosh! - I'll give you No. 10 on the first floor. - Thanks. - Just fill that out, please. - Do you have a directory? - Street or 'phone? - Phone. - There. - Thanks. - I've no one to take your bag. - That's OK. - You understand me. - Yes... that's right. You understand me. Yes... good night sir. Nobody loves me. Of course they do... everybody loves you! Now you have to go home to bed. Rue Claude-Bernard! That's odd. No trouble at 6am. God... is it 6? " The hour of invigorating Phosphatine that brings the rosy-fingered dawn" - You read a lot? - No... movies. - It was in "Miquette and her Mother" - Gotta go. Me too... 'bye daddyo. See you at the bistro. What? Hey, wait a minute! This is the best of the year. Impossible to take so many. - No charge. - What? "No charge"? For free! Let's go! Have fun! 6 o'clock me finish. I finish... Go, go! American go home? Yes! Are you a communist? No... not at all! Alright, I'll take you. - Boulevard what? - Saint Michael. - Where's that? - Boul Mich! Couldn't you have told me before? What num?ro? Five! Good Liliane, I'll be there right away. You wait for me? Quiet! What's all the ruckus? A mob of Yanks who fell on top of me. Can you hear it? What are you up to? Can we join in? - Lambert's on the rampage. - Tell me about it. Not suitable for children. How much? 400 francs Your coffee's getting cold. Hang on, I'll be 2 minutes. 500 for you Good luck with your coffee. We live here. Thanks. Hotel Moscow I'm sorry, we don't have any cabs right this moment. Are you free? Yes, but not for short trips. I'll have to take another cab. None of that! Hey, driver!... You're going too fast! Liliane, I want to kiss you. Do you know what I want? I nice hot coffee. - And my sandwiches? - They're coming. Here... I hate to see you suffering. - You're an angel. - You bet. We rejoice more over the happiness of other people. - Lovers make me sentimental. - Go to bed! That's what I was thinking. You put me onto a dud, at Rue Saint-Claude. The usual... The guy calls, goes outside, sees a taxi and takes it. And when you arrive the customer's gone. Exactly, except he was there... and left on foot, running. He changed his mind. So many weirdos around at night. I know something weird... Someone who's formal at night and pally during the day. During working hours you're just number 325. - And outside working hours? - You're a funny number! Coffee with milk is terrible stuff. - It puts me to sleep. - It's always like that. So, "nighties", is it all happening? - You needn't worry about us "nighties". - Of course not. - With mugs like yours? - Thanks for nothing. Day and night are different worlds. - We soak up the sunshine! - With the exhaust fumes. - No drunks. - That's true. - People are easy-going at night. - They're having fun. - You in a hurry? - I'm asleep on my feet. - You're not going on again? Oh, yes. - How much? - Both? No, separate. - You won't accept anything from me. - Yes... non-essentials... Like an aperitif. But not breakfast. Well, well. I don't want you feeding me. - And why, may I ask? - Just the way I feel. - The day a guy starts feeding me... - That day...? Nothing... you're too nosey. You dreaming? Yes... About the day I buy you breakfast. You'll get into a fight over the switchboard. Meaning...? Find yourself another hunting ground. - I'm serious - The door! OK! What a pest! - You can be so stubborn! - I know someone else the same. Go on... stay with me! - I don't want to act like everyone else. - Here we go again. Since I've known you, nobody's come down to Pigalle. They'll have to close the station. If you don't like me, tell me right now. Please stop pushing! I get off next stop... and you? - I'm not what you think. - I thought you were a good girl. - Boor! - Filthy beast! - Stop it! There are other people. - Not at my place. There's been a lot of people there... Too many! - Liliane! - I think you change trains here. - Are you getting off? - Unfortunately. Goodnight, no. 3-25! - Howdy, Marlon - Howdy. Bugger of a job! You want something, mister? No... no thanks. A coffee. - How much? - With a croissant? - Yes - That comes to 80. Keep it. I'm in a hurry. You have my registration? I have your contract, the deposit cheque... You must have the rego papers. There it is... how silly of me! - Can I go now? - Certainly. There's only 5 litres of gas. Is that enough? France-Soir! Le Monde! Paris-Presse! France-Soir Suicide of industrialist Verdier. Police investigating. - This is nice. - This is nice, too. Well... read it! Goodness me! - Okay, so what? - Are you still asleep? No. - I'm dreaming. - Stop being stupid! This can't be a suicide. Would you recognize the man you saw running away? Yes... and HE'd know ME. Good... get dressed and we'll go to the police. No... wait a minute. - I hate cops. - Nobody's asking you to love them. The one time I get you here, I want to keep you. A man's been killed. It's your duty to testify. "My duty", "my duty"! I can see you know nothing about cops. They'll let me stew for an hour in a corridor. After that, they bombard you with questions... "What were you doing at Neuilly?" "Describe the suspect... dark, fair, tall?" "He was carrying a satchel? What colour? "Any special features? Did you know him?" "Shut up!" "Why didn't you go into the house?" The truth is too simple for them. Truth doesn't interest them... And they don't believe it. - You're the witness. - I was one once... I know what happens. I gave my name regarding an accident. At the hearing, I got chewed out by the lawyer. The friend I testified for, told me I'd effectively blamed him. I lost a day's work. That taught me a lesson for all time. If everyone thought like you... But this man you know is a decent guy. A good little boy-scout. He wants to serve justice. - But you forget the main thing. - What? That you're here in front of me, in my house... for the first time, thanks to this newspaper story. I must really thank that guy. - He brought Liliane to me. - I have to go. - This is reserved for taxis! - So what? What was that?! It's you! - What are you doing here? - I've come to look for a pal of mine. Haven't seen you for ages. - Is this hot little number yours? - Oh yeah! Wow! May I? Be my guest. So after work, you take this out for your pleasure. - It's a different kettle of fish. - Better than taking the bus... Or being like the driver who gets his pedals mixed up. I wonder which is worse. - Still on the radio? - Sure am. I couldn't get used to it. You're already coping with pedestrians, cyclists, red lights... Having to answer the phone on top of all that... But you get a regular phone-order clientele... good tippers... and you don't waste time. I prefer the old system: Instinct. You'd better make that work... you're about to lose a customer! - 'Bye - 'Bye Coming? What takes advantage of you and still yells at you? You're despicable I bet you can't stand on tiptoe... Your jealous lover, already? Well, the old crab himself... Come in. I've got my wheels, I'll give you a lift. Both of you. Raymond's like a father to us. - Thank goodness for ancestors. - Margot will go bananas. Lovers in the back. I'm your driver. 30 years experience... It's stronger than me. Don't mind me. Shut it! That's not on. You see that?... Pure jealousy. Thank you driver. How much is that? This is my week of goodwill. Your week? More like your minute! - See you tomorrow. - 'bye, kids. Tell me... there's something I want to know. Earlier at my place when you wanted to go... did you know you had the time? - You're very nosey. - Answer me... Did you have the time? 'Til tomorrow, for the cream in your coffee. Liliane And don't forget to make a living. I don't have a cent on me. Yippee! No luck at your place? No luck?... Things went brilliantly! 18 Quai aux Fleurs... 27, 5 and 2, Rue de Tournon. " And her voice, distant, and quiet and deep, 'has the inflection of beloved voices that have fallen silent. " Like that? It's from Verlaine. I said "27 Rue de Tournon" You're working now. Very good, Colonel! Rue de Tournon, 5 minutes, Colonel! I love you, Colonel! The Opera House. Thank you, sir. I repeat: "10 Rue de Maubeuge" Anyone in the area? 3-25 Rue de Maubeuge in 4 minutes. And breakfast is going to be sumptuous, Colonel! You've got a funny look. You been up to something silly? - Sort of. - Do we get to know? Would you like to? I'll tell all! - I bought the newspaper. - Well then? - That's it. - You're kidding me. Not half! Do you have to take up the whole road?! You just worry about yourself! You want a punch in the face?! I should teach you a lesson. Want to repeat that? Is this really necessary? You're lucky I'm in a hurry. - And we're stupid to get worked up. - Always. - Sorry about that, ladies. - That's alright. - Sounds like a rattletrap. - It can carry you all, old chum. Step on it, it's dawdling! You interrupted me just at the critical moment. There's no oil in the gearbox. Just like in the cabs. - The Marne cabs, anyhow. - Go on... laugh. Tell me when to stop. Just here, driver. - What's that creaky noise? - The brake, of course. - It's the same as the gear-noise! - Gimme a break! We're there. What a strange place! How much is that? -8,75 Oh, that's a lot! Now you have to attack me. Go on... a rabbit punch. - For real? - Go on... whack me! Well then, here I go! - You might've hurt yourself! - No... I'm fine! This is where I use my grip. Watch carefully. Got your hand... You right?... - Greetings! - You just missed the best ever! Did "The Champ" get into trouble? It was because I wanted to fall. I wouldn't hurt a woman. 10 years all-in wrestling in all the rings of Paris... - and I never had a 3-count. -10 count perhaps?! I wasn't known as "Bob the Gripper" for nothing. - I reigned 10 years at the ?lys?e. - Where? Well, it was the Montmartre ?lys?e. - Is the grub ready? - Should be... I'll check. What's on the menu? Tripes. You know... Having a girl settle in... that makes her really somebody. When I think of all the time I've wasted. - So what? You had fun. - There's no fun in having fun. Up you get, kids. There's a car ride on the house! Come this afternoon and I'll give you lessons in eye-gouging. "Eye gouging"? How sweet of you! Bye bye, pussycat. See you tomorrow, guys. 6 Place des Vosges I repeat: 6 Place des Vosges - Boulevard de Bercy - What number? I'll stop you. Not cold tonight. Need to fix the mirror. Do you have a light? Thanks. - Hullo, 3-25, you're blocking reception. - Cut your transmitter. - Where are you going? - Boulevard Bercy... I know the way. Me too... Turn right! Turn right! I know the way - You'd better not insist. - It's alright. - Stop on the left. - This isn't Bercy Do what I tell you. Drop that. - Out of the question. - Drop that wrench. I don't think so. You recognized me, eh? You? Never saw you before. You're a bad liar. Listen... If you're here it's because I need to talk... without being disturbed... you understand. There's nothing to talk about... We don't know each other. Will you please listen to me, or I'll have to force you to! Stay away from me. Stay away from me! Look at me carefully. Say anything to you? Yes, it says something to me. You have a face nobody would forget. You want to bump me off, eh? Then there'll be 2 of us. You're going to drop that! Your flag's down! What are you doing there? Aren't you a taxi? Saint-Germain-des-Pr?s... quick. I'm not free. - It's showing "Free". - It's not any more. Yes, but I'm in here. Get out, I'm going back to the depot. I'm going to the "Deux Magots". - What's going on? - He got into my car. - So what? - So my shift is finished. You're flag was up... So you take him. Liliane... This is officer P?charel, of the crime squad. Excuse us miss, but we need you to explain the situation. [Italian] Are you sure it's not Lambert who's driving? - How much do I owe you? -340.

He's been either wounded or killed. The murderer has made off with his taxi... number 1-402-FK-75 The man is armed. Look out for this car, and let me know if you see anything. Quick... Get out!
