[SCHOOL BELL RINGING] Like that feeling when you leave on the last day of school and when your hands get sticky from ice cream melting off the cone. Swimming with friends, sometimes with boys, if you're lucky. Sleeping till 2:00. [SIREN WAILING] Borrowing the car. When nothing significant ever happens, it's very easy for the days to melt together, passing slowly like a lazy river. [DISTANT CHATTER] I can go tomorrow. I can be back tomorrow. I'll be back tomorrow. - Okay. - Hey. Okay, will do. I'll be in tomorrow, okay? [SIGHS] She doesn't look too good. Where have you been? - Bathroom. - And where is Dad? He's on a work call right out there. I'm starving. Can you sit and chitchat with Grandma until I get a salad or something? - You want anything? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Wait, actually, wait. - What? What if she, like, dies? She's not gonna die while I get a salad. It's totally possible. You know what? Text me. If she dies, text me. Don't say it so loud. She'll hear you. SHIRA: She's not gonna die. [MONITOR BEEPING] JAMIE: This was the summer I fucked up. ♪♪ [SIGHS] Jamie? Oh, yeah. Come here. Okay. I have to tell you something. Oh, Grandma, it's okay. You look so sleepy. Shh. Girl, it's important. This is something you need to hear. I want you to know you're going to heaven. Grandma, that's so sweet. No, you don't understand. I know this for a fact. Um, I'm not quite getting what you... Well, your mother's a dirty Jew. Oh. So when you were a baby, I had you baptized without your parents knowing. Isn't that marvelous? It's... You don't have to be afraid anymore. Afraid? Oh, my God. What? Afraid of what? Well, of going to hell. Going to... Okay. Okay, yeah, um... I should probably get going. - Not yet, honey. - Okay. There's just one more thing. One thing in this world that you need to know, and no one's gonna have the guts to tell you. I wish I had been prepared for it. Learn how to give a good blow job. Jamie, what happened? Are you okay? I'll tell you in the car. SHIRA: When did she even, honestly, take her to get baptized? When she was, like, watching her for a weekend, she took her and dumped her in water? JAMIE: I didn't tell them about the blow job part, for obvious reasons. I mean, I've never even seen a real dick up close before. [GIRLS CHATTING] Oh, my God! ALL: Whoo! GUY: Baby, don't leave! JAMIE: I didn't see what the big deal was. SHIRA: Because she is half-Jewish. There's no way you take that away. But faith or whatever? NED: She didn't indoctrinate her into a cult, okay? - Didn't she though? - Just Catholic. It just wasn't something we talked about. Half of you is still going to hell. You're fine. You're not going to hell. By the way, bad half's gonna have a real good time. You're welcome. ♪ No matter how far we go ♪ ♪ Or how long the ride ♪ ♪ I want you to always remember ♪ ♪ Love always comes on time ♪ [BEEPING] SHIRA: I mean, she just had to give me one last fuck you, right? You are blowing this out of proportion. - She loves you. - No, she does not love me. - Let's not be crazy. - Okay, hey. She's dying. Cut her some slack. SHIRA: I'm sorry. [PHONE RINGING] [RINGING CONTINUES] Hello? Is she dead? ♪♪ [SOMBER] She wasn't though. And I know it's an awful thing to think, but looking back, kinda wish she had been. I don't have much time left. I've always wondered what snapped inside her. What is that thing that makes old people accept that they're gonna die? That invisible force that completely deletes whatever filter they had left. You were a very difficult child, Hope, which is partly my fault for having you so late. I mean, you'd cry and cry, sometimes for days. Um, is there, is there a point to this story, Mom? I used to lock you in the downstairs coat closet till you wore yourself out, just to get some peace. I've been carrying this with me for years. I believe in my heart Dotty genuinely thought she was helping. Yeah, and maybe I was just practice for the main event, but that night she decided to finish what she started with me. [INHALING] Oh, don't be so dramatic. You are a sweet boy, Dylan. Thank you. And you are clearly a homosexual. - A what? - I'm partly to blame. I should've sent you away years ago. I think it would do you and your mother some good if you went away and got yourself fixed. Your life would be easier in the long run. Will you do that for me, Dylan? I never liked you, Shira. Oh, really? Oh, wait, I knew you didn't like me. I think I knew that was coming. This actually feels really good. Oh, Ned, you're my baby. Oh, I'm gonna miss you so much. I have to tell you something that I should've told you years ago when your father died. What is it, Mom? Well... I'm afraid that you won't forgive me. Mom, there's nothing that you can say that's gonna make me love you less, okay? Okay. [LAUGHS] Your father, George, my late husband, well, he wasn't exactly... Wasn't exactly what? NED: Are you fucking kidding me? You knew this my entire life, and you didn't tell me! What the fuck is wrong with you? What is happening? Apparently our dad is not my dad. Did you know that? Did you know about this? - No! - Who? It's some other guy. What the fuck is his name, Mom? Mom, what is he talking about? Wait, who is my grand... Was it not Grandpa George? Herman Lawrence. Herman fucking Lawrence! Okay, can we not swear in front of Dylan? - Put your headphones on. - Who is Herman Lawrence? Is he still alive? Does anyone know if he's alive? Is it an Italian name? Lorenz? I just wanna say this is the kind of shit she pulls. - You're a cunt! - Whoa! - She's lying! - She is manipulative, okay? I'm sorry you had to see it this way. Stop! Just stop!

Yeah, why wouldn't he come and stay in our guest room? Sounds like he needs to actually be in hospital, and if he was coming, maybe you'd call, let me know to change the sheets. I don't know. That doesn't seem unreasonable. Fine. I'm not a mind reader. [SCOFFS] So, Jamie, are you planning on speaking at the memorial service? I know Dylan's gonna say a few words and... - Oh, no. - She's gonna speak. You know how I feel about public speaking. How about a DNA test? There's no way, Ned, for you to know... Will you drop this? - He is my son! - Okay. All of you stop talking about me like I am not here. - Especially the shiv. - Excuse me? Wait, so you guys didn't know that he was super anti-Semitic? It was just me. Okay, I got this. Let's just chock this one up to cultural differences. I'm sure that he didn't mean what he said. I'm right here, heeb. - Okay. Well, you know what? - What's a heeb? - Okay, enough. - Dylan, headphones on. Does anyone think that he might be, like, super racist? - That's hard to misunderstand. - Hon... You don't need to get the DNA test, honey, because obviously Dotty and Herman make a lovely couple. Can you explain to me why I'm having to deal with this in my own home, in front of my family? Why is this... 'Cause I am trying to connect with my father, okay? Your dad is an anti-Semite. Oh, like you've gone to temple that much. Oh, my God! Just because I don't go to temple all the time, I deserve to be called a heeb in my house? Do you not understand that this is crazy? This whole situation is crazy. All I'm saying is that we all have parents that are difficult. I'm just saying your parents are not perfect. Oh, I... Oh, my... I... What? It's a different world!

[CONGREGATION CHUCKLING] But, um... But hearing all of you say such nice things about her, it just kinda makes me wonder if that was the same woman I knew. I think what I've realized the hardest part about this whole thing is figuring out how to forgive someone that you can't talk to. To me, Dotty was tough, you know? She wasn't always nice. I mean, my poor parents. They just... My dad just found out that this guy, Herman, is his real father. And then Dotty told my mom that she never liked her because she's Jewish. I mean, God, it's 2003, for Christ's sake. This is what happens when people don't talk to each other. This is why family shouldn't keep secrets from one another. To clear her conscience, Dotty chose to burden us with just a bunch of fucked-up shit. - Thank you, Jamie. - I'm not finished, Father. [CONGREGATION MURMURING] Um... Before Dotty died, she told me that she had me baptized when I was a baby without my parents knowing. With you, actually. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Man, she must have really wanted me to go to heaven. But you know what the funniest thing is? After she told me this whole baptism thing and convinced me that religion really needed to play a much larger role in my life, she told me a secret. The secret of life. - Jamie... - Shh, not now. Oh, by the way, this is Luke, everyone. He officially becomes a priest tomorrow! Can we please give him a round of applause? Whoo! Okay, anyway. So I was sitting with Dotty, right? She just told me about the baptism thing. These words actually come out of her mouth: "Jamie, there is one thing in this world you need to know, but no one will have the guts to tell you, something I wish I had been prepared for." "Learn how to give a proper blow job." - [CONGREGATION MURMURING] - What? Yup. So this woman is on her deathbed, and she decides that her last words to me are telling me that I need to learn how to give head, okay? So I chock this up to her being old and demented. But then I met this guy. It was Luke, actually. And he made me feel safe and good about myself when I came to the church looking for answers. Okay, Jamie, that's enough. So good, in fact, that he... he helped my sweet, sweet grandma get her dying wish. [MURMURING CONTINUES] Luke! She doesn't know what she's talking about.
