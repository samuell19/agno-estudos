Yes, and money, by the way. The money is safe. Sorry. And no T-shirt, that's what. Where is the boat? Then how are we from here? Really. I don’t know, I didn’t agree with him. Is it an island or what? And the devil only knows. Why did you let him go? Well, here we are. Are you brothers? What are you up to? German Ivanovich! What? - Is this your invention? Well then explain. I can be said to have been torn away from women. German Ivanovich, I ... By the way, I didn't understand either. What are we going to do here? Like what, here's a fire, now we'll dry. Let's eat. And you will have women at home. And all the rest. Women, keys, money. It's all there, okay? Such an agreement. Whoever doesn't like it, swim back. Well, everything is fine there, no? Everything will be, everything will be, guys. Settle yourself. Come on, give it to me. We must still find out if this is an island or ... what? What for? Then back on what? On the logs. Sit still do not ask, most importantly, questions. We also have an agreement on this. I see that you have reached an agreement here. Yes, guys, we have an interesting company. You maybe weigh me in your store and you, what good you will take off your jacket on a dark alley. Who am I? - Never mind. You see, you are like friends. Indeed. To be honest, I haven’t had one. Well, in vain. To be friends is, brother, you also have to try. Here I have enough friends, let's say. Why, and I have friends ... Birthday - full apartment. Nowhere to plant. All traders? Not only. Traders are people too. And I also have doctors, by the way. My doctors are friends. The professor is alone. Ear-throat-nose. Neuropathologist. Docent. Wife at the Philharmonic. And you give them meat, tenderloin. I am their friendship. But meat too, right? Wow, I don’t like your brother. All these yours have taken over ear-throat-noses. Why queues? From the fact that everything is out of line. From this? Such as you feed, heal each other. Where did so many envious people come from? My wife is the same. Let's come back now, ask how they spent time. It must be answered, which is bad. Then she is good, then she is kind. You say okay will burst with envy. That's right. I still had a friend from the army. We can say the most cherished. We started together at the factory. But then I got married, he got married. He has a child, I have two. It all went wrong. Here one wife did not like the other. Not so, you see, accepted. And off it went. And my friend died, guys. He died of vodka. Believe it, no? Drank, drank. I gave it up. And that’s all. Died. Buried this spring. And I'm afraid of mine. I don’t get up from the place, I'm afraid, that's all. Not that she writes where or in the party ... There is nothing like that. Behaves normally. The mood works. Do you know how? Here is silent. And you're already nervous, you start to think which is not what you did not please her. You start to think. And so, in silence, I twisted it. You twist you. Not. Mine is just talkative. As he opens his mouth, so nothing ... Your? - Mine. Can you imagine, swam, eh? Well, by God, I can't swim. And then nothing came up. And he did not drown. Wonders! No guys, we need to to meet in the city. And when? When shall we meet? We have never been in two years. We are here together in a heap, we go somewhere unknown. And then ... last time. Why last? But because they won’t take us anymore. We are old. Exactly, age. But, comrade. Hey. Hey. Come here please. Whose tent is there? Yours? My. And the boat? Mine too. Don't sell? What? The boat. Well, is there a buyer? Here he is. I would love to, but the boat is government-owned. From the camp site. Clear. And who are you? Physics? Why a physicist? Similar. I am not a physicist, I am a chemist. What, seriously chemist? Yes? But where are you chemical? In the car park? In the shop? - Why in the store? And where? I am really a chemist. Organic chemist. PhD. I'm on vacation. Well, that’s it, comrade candidate. We are military men, though not in uniform. We have a task. Special task. Very important. We need to get out of this damn island. I do not know. Take him prisoner, or what? Together with the boat. What do you say, senior lieutenant? Or come on voluntarily. Do you feel better? Hello. Hello. Fedya. Fedya arrived. Natalya Sergeevna, look. My son has arrived, Fedya. With comrades. Sorry. Finally. Where have you been for so long, because I'm waiting for you. Sorry, mother, you probably ... Fedya! Here. Here, comrades. I’m waiting for you in the morning. Come on, hurry up. I ask you. Comrades, stop. There’s some mistake. We are from the camp site. We are tourists. We went here. Who are you waiting for? Tourists? And not from the repair shop? Not. This is the number. And where are these? Repairmen. Well well. You eat. We do not have guests in a nursing home. Infrequently. Like a curiosity. And they are waiting for you. Fedya! Fedya. Fedya. Sorry, but ... Tell her that you are her son. Never mind, she'll forget tomorrow. I am a doctor myself, I know. Don't be afraid, tell me. Mother. Mum. I'm here. I'm here. You see me? - Sure. Let's go to. From the road! Chicken legs! You were then taken away along Lake Ladoga. And I was at work. In hospital. I come, neither you nor Marina. I am at all orphanages. And then, when the blockade was broken, I go there and here. For reference. And they tell me they are at this age could forget their names. And all the documents were gone. Search. They say according to signs. Somewhere alive. Grew up. Maybe what kind of mole is there? No, I say, as luck would have it. And you see. I will face you right away. You look like a father. Yes, yes. Why don't you drink? The tea is fresh and delicious. Here are the cheesecakes today. Yes, yes, come in. Natalya Sergeevna. Darling. Later. My son came to me. Good good. Well, tell me. I don't know anything about you. Are you married. Yes. And there are children? Son, thirteen years old. Do you have a card with you? Sorry. And who is your wife? She works. We learned together. I went to astronomy. She is going to school. Well, tell me, tell me more. I want to know everything about you. What are you? Cheerful? No, I guess. And taciturn. Why? I do not know. Nothing to talk about. Well? How is it, not about anything? Everything has been discussed. Everything is generally known. Tired of words. You have friends? Not. Rather, there is. These are the people with which I came. You are kind? No, I would not say. Where did you get this astronomy? Is this a childhood dream? I studied well. And good students dream become astronomers. Discover the stars. But everything has long been open. Really? It can't be. And yet What are you doing? I live. I'm working. I don't like this, Fedya. You have to be more fun. I think this is not enough for you. My father and I were very funny people. We must often recall that life is beautiful. I am doing my best. Anna Vasilievna, we are visiting our guest now. Fedenka, they are waiting for you there. Mom will go to bed now. And you will come tomorrow, right? Go, Fedenka, go. Everything is laid out there. Go ahead. See you tomorrow, huh? I told them here about the parade of planets. Do you see what's going on? I haven’t messed up, right? You can't see a damn thing. This one has binoculars. Well, dad, saw, no? All right, let them look. Today, planets line up. Once a thousand years. Carbine! Kustana-ah-ah! Carbine. Bush.
