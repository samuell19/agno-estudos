Back here. - Hey Jim, give us a statement. - Hey, I don't even know what's going on yet. What do we got? Well, she's stuck down there alright chief. We figure about 19 feet. We don't know what position she's in, or the extent of her injuries, or whether she's head first, or what's keeping her from slipping. It's... it's like we're blind. Backhoe here's causing too much vibration. Besides that, he can only get about ten feet. Where's the mother? Uh, she's over there. The Victim's Assistance volunteer's over there with her trying to keep her out of the way and, uh, calm her down. What were you thinking of when you brought that thing in here? I think it's the right thing to do. We need to dig a parallel shaft to the well there. With what? A larger backhoe might cause a cave-in. Chief, we passed a rathole rig out on Loop 250. Let's go get it then. - Confiscate it if you have to. - Right chief. We'll get rid of the fence, then. Alright. I've been in West Texas a long time. There must be a hundred thousand wells like these. But this is a first. I've never seen anything like it anywhere. How long have you been in town now, chief? A year? Yeah. And this is the longest conversation we've ever had. Why aren't they doing anything? I'm sure they are. I'll go talk to them. Carolyn Henry, Victim's Assistance. Is there anything I can tell the mother? She's terribly distraught. Oh, well, uh... Uh... I wish I could tell you something positive ma'am, but -- Mrs. Henry, do you have any idea how that little girl got down this hole? Tell her we'll have her baby out in a couple of hours. In all due respect, chief, do you know something I don't know? I mean, this ain't a kitten up a tree. They say they'll have her out in a couple of hours. Hours? We got an 18 month-old girl named Jessica McClure trapped down an abandoned 8-inch water well. Uh, we got oxygen down to her, and we can hear her. She's been making sounds and she seems to be alright. We expect to have her out in a couple of hours. [reporters clamoring] - That's all I got, guys. - [reporters mumbling] This is Rodney Wuench, KMID, TV Channel 2 reporting live from Southwest Midland where -- [radio] An 18 month-old child has fallen down an abandoned water well in the West Midland area. Reports at this time are incomplete, but in an interview, police spokesmen at the site said they expect to have her out in quote "a couple of hours." And now, the weather. I bet they don't get her out alive. Oh, God. Sissy. Don't you think we should call your husband now? Wouldn't he want to know? Yes. I mean no. Not now. He should know what's happened. I don't want to bother him at work. I'm afraid. I'm afraid to... Can we wait? They said only a couple of hours! Jessica? Jessica, mommy's here! Jessica? Jessica, it's mommy! Please talk to mommy! Please talk to me, baby! [baby noises] Yes, I'm here, it's gonna be okay I'm gonna get you outta there! Sissy, Sissy. Sissy, Chip has a right to know what's happened here. Okay. [wailing sirens] Now, this is if that rig can do it. All I can think of is to sink a rescue shaft down next to her, then drill across to where we think she is, she's about two feet tall so that means digging across there at about 22 feet, that means we're gonna have to have a shaft of oh, 28, 29 feet deep. How deep is the well? Drillers we talked to said they go down, 80 to 100 feet deep. The steel casings go down about 6 to 8 feet. She's at 19 to 22 feet. If she hasn't slipped further down. - Let's go with, call it plan A. - What's plan B? We haven't got one yet. How's the mother holding up? She's calming down. Her sister's here and we've called her husband's boss trying to locate him. What should I tell her? I'll try to keep you informed, Miss Henry. You tell her whatever you think's best. I'd like to tell you more ma'am I wish I could but, this isn't exactly the blind leading the blind, but we are... - A new experience here. - And at the bottom of the well there's a, well there's water. She slips... Does anybody have any good news? [baby noises] Well, like I was saying, tell her -- Tell her we're gonna get her out. Tell her everything's gonna be okay. I wish I knew what makes you so sure about this. I got a major problem here and I'd like to speak for myself on this. This is a rescue operation. I don't know who's in charge here but I do know that the fire department does not chase crooks or write tickets. Our job is to save lives. We'll do what we do best. You do what you do best. [baby noises] This is gonna take all of us. We got a plan, we'll see to it that you get whatever it - takes to implement it. - Thank you chief. Alright, let's get moving.

How long has she been down there? Almost four hours! Why didn't you call me? - How'd this happen? - I'm sorry Chip. She's always doing things. You know? Come here. Shut it off, shut it off! Jessica? Jessica? Talk to me Jessica. Don't be scared baby we're gonna make a lot of noise but we're coming to getcha. [baby crying] Let's get him in the house. Okay baby. Good girl. Good girl. Then we're gonna drill a shaft down next to the well, put a drift across, that's kinda like a sideways tunnel. We're gonna get her out. we're gonna get her outta there. But how long? How soon can I have my baby back? Well, uh, I, I guess by a couple of hours? Is there anything I can do to help? No son, we don't think she's hurt bad. I mean she sounds pretty good considering, and... I think we got everything under control. You just stay here take care of your family. Bring her around! Little more! Hold! [harsh grinding] Hold it hold it! Caliche. Runs in layers about four feet deep around here, harder than hell. Can you get through it? Yeah, it's gonna wear that bit down in a hurry, gonna need some carbine tips to get some purchase on that rock if we're ever gonna get through it. Then we'll get 'em. [squeaking drill] Better cut the power to that line. We temporarily cut power to about six hundred homes but with all this heavy equipment you got coming in here, anything hits it its gonna fry everybody - in the yard. - Cut it! You want some lights set up for the night? Nah we'll have her out by then! [babbling reporters] -- to pray for the safety of little Jessica McClure, rescue efforts are intensifying. At this hour, a parallel rescue shaft is being drilled next to the water well she fell into. The drilling, however, is being slowed by thick layers of rock, caliche. Rescuers say it will be just a few more hours before they are able to reach the little girl. Jessica? [baby crying] I don't know how long I can take this, Manny. I just wanna do something. We got a crowd control problem, I don't believe this. I called for more security. We're not gonna have her out of there by dark. [yelling reporters] We're gonna be here for a while, you better inform the press. I don't want a lot of rumors floating around. How they doing? They're fine, until they see the McClures. Well then, keep the McClures out of sight. Yes sir. Mr. McClure, Ms. McClure, press is going crazy with y'all out here. It'd sure help if you go back inside. Please? We believe we'll have the little girl out soon. We need and I repeat we need no more assistance or help. Everything's under control and we're doing the best we can with trained rescue personnel. Please stay clear of the area. We don't have power or gas until they, until they get her out. When? They keep telling us just a few more hours. Just a few. I'm gonna go see if I can get us an update. Twenty-nine feet, Twenty-five of it solid rock. Let's go, let's get our best men down that hole! - Alright! - Excuse me. Oh! Oh, how are the McClures? They're still in shock. They can't understand why it's taking so long. Well, we bore down 29 feet took us most of 8 hours. You tell them, we just gotta dig over five feet to the well shaft there to get her out, how long could that take? - I have no idea. - I don't either ma'am. But if you would tell them please, we know she's alive we're gonna get her out of this as soon as - humanly possible. - Yes sir. I know you said you don't need no help - but I think I could help. - Well, we could use it how? I'm a spelunker. I explore caves. It's not for everybody. You got a vertical cave here and you got the right equipment, you got caving gear? What, like a headlamp? Headlamps, climbing ropes, rigging apparatus. Where you got yours? Home. Live about twenty minutes from here. - Go, go! - Come on I'll take you. Alright. Ready? Let's go. [instructions being said] [drilling] Oh my god, nothing. [drilling] Dropped 20 degrees. Chief, chief! Temperature in the well has dropped down to 60 degrees. We're looking at possible hypothermia. How long did you stay down? If you can't raise the temperature, I'm afraid we - don't have long at all. - Who are you? I'm Doctor Fitzpatrick. I just got off shift at Midland Memorial, I'll offer any assistance I can. - What'd you get? - Very little. So we gotta get some heat down that hole. Or we could lose her. Please don't let my baby die. Please. As 18 month old Jessica McClure undergoes her 14th hour of entrapment, rescue crews continue to drill. Rescuers above ground say they can still her crying, say that's a good sign. Good sign meaning she's still alive and she doesn't appear to be slipping. A not-so-good sign is the reading on the well thermometer. It's around sixty degrees. Too low for a small child. Just about an inch. Getting only a half inch to an inch an hour. We got us a heater. From the telephone company. Oh good, gonna get some warm air down to her. You called them? Nope, just showed up! Just like the diamond drill did. They just dropped them off free of charge out of the blue. Just like the welders. We said we didn't need any help. Good thing nobody listened to us. 80 degrees, steady. You gotta try to get some rest, Andy. No, not me chief. I can't leave. I'll stay right here, just till we get her out. Besides that, she needs us. Isn't that right, Manny? I'm getting to know her moods now, sir. How's she doing? Right now she's asleep. I hope. Doctor, listen, is it gonna get too dry for her down there? No it shouldn't, there is moisture coming up from the well and if she's wet her pants that'll help humidify it. We've got the temperature to 80 degrees. Get something for her to drink maybe some water? We don't know the extent of internal injuries, that could do more harm than good. She can go 36 maybe 48 hours before dehydration will be a factor. How much longer? Oh, going awful slow, you see, we got to go 60 inches across there and at an inch an hour that's almost three days. - Who's down there now? - Walden. How many times has he been down? Three? I can't keep him up here. Cut off his air, get him on up here! He can't be doing any good as exhausted as he must be. Walden! You get on up here now! Come on boy! What time is it? 4. 4 in the morning. Don't you have to get home? Not until your little girl's safe and sound. Do you have kids? Yes. Yes I do. I have a daughter just about your age. You do? You're kidding. I mean, y'all look so young and all. Well, we get married pretty young around here. Yeah I've been blessed. I'm a grandmother too. That's neat. I married my first love too. Chip wanted a boy so bad. Until he held Jessica for the first time. Then I don't think he put her down for a year. I kept telling him put her down or she'll never learn to crawl. He was worried about being a daddy. But he's born to it. And Juicy, we call her Juicy because she's just... So cute, and all. Let it go, baby. Come on, come on. I want someone to be angry at. I want to shoot somebody or something. But there's nobody to blame. That's all right. It just happened. There is nobody to blame. I wish it was me in that hole. What makes us think, out here in the middle of nowhere, out here in Midland, Texas, we can pull this thing off? - We can do it. - I don't know. 38 years in the fire department I've done nothing even close to this before. We're just groping! That baby's been down there 18 hours, 10 hours we just got 8 inches closer to her. Well, we got hardworking people. I think we're gonna need some more help. I think you're right. Lotta people in these parts - drill oil wells for a living. - At least they used to, before it didn't pay to drill them. We need a miracle is what we need. Dammit. We're gonna get her out. Look alive! [TV] We have apparently encountered a solid wall of what one rescue worker refers to as 'prehistoric concrete.' Now, firemen and volunteers have been doing their best but we need help. We're putting out a request for some experienced hard rock drillers to lend a hand. Chief Roberts? Chief. - I brought my little boy here. - Aw. Now, he's little, but he is strong. Now, we can lower him down the pipe by his feet, and he can pull that little girl up! Come here son. Oh, my that's so brave of you. Boy we wouldn't want you to get stuck down that hole, now would we? No sir. Sally Jo, get that nut and his poor little kid out of here. Right. Give me the station if you would. [people yelling] Alright, now listen up! All I want is drillers and underground and hard rock. That's him and me. We do it for a living. - Excuse me. - What's your name? Charles Bowler. - This is my boy Ribble. - Howdy. Come on through. [melancholy music] - Can I help? - What? What do you want? I said, can I help? I heard you need thin, strong guys to go down in the hole there. I said no, we're doing fine. Well listen, I'm the baby's daddy, and -- Uh huh, there, sure you are, kid. Look, get on out of here, we're real busy here. Crackpots coming outta the woodwork, ain't they? Hey, hey! I gotta get through, I can help that little girl! You ain't gonna fit in that hole, trust me! No I gotta get through to talk to the chief. They're going about it all wrong! I got a line on special equipment. Mister, we got ideas coming in from all over. Why don't you cooperate, stand back there, we'll have you out of here. Come on. [Drilling] City attorney's got a line on some expert help. What's he got? Well there's a mine health and safety guy they got a hold of. Federal government is what he is, in Carlsbad. Somebody's been making some phone calls. That's a four, five hour drive. There have been some other phone calls! Clayton Williams, private jet is ready to go get the guy, could be here in less than an hour. You know, this thing might not work out right. If it doesn't it's all on us. Frankly, we could use some help covering our butts. All I want to do is just talk to the man for a few minutes, that's all. Chief! Chief! My names Bill Jones, my wife's sister used to work for this company, they got a high powered -- We're awful busy here Mr. Jones, I appreciate your concern but you see those people over there? Every one of them has an idea. Somebody's got a trained monkey. Somebody wants to drop a baby bottle down so she'll climb up after it. Soak a piece of cloth in super clue, there's a guy running around here someplace, says he's got no collarbone. Some of my people think he might come in handy, so I'll tell you what I'll do, you continue your way, I'm gonna continue mine. Come on! I'll be back dammit! You're dealing with Old Bill Jones, stubborn old West Texas cuss -- And you are dealing with Sally Jo Francis. Stay behind this barrier please sir. Steve. Hey Robert. How are they doing? Just got off shift. I got here a couple of hours ago. Some of the guys have been down drilling but uh, now we got some pros. Is there a thing we could do? Just stand by I guess until they get her out. Yeah, if they get her out. Medic, Medic! Get over here! Come on buddy. Hold him up, hold him up! Sit back. Here we go. Breathe, breathe. - They gonna get her out? - Robert, cool. Who's running this thing anyhow? The cops or us? This is a rescue isn't it? Everybody and his brother's in on this thing. This isn't a contest. A little girl may die. I don't care if its the tooth fairy that gets her out of there. Take care of this boy. What are you two doing here? Well sir, I guess we just want to help. You're gonna get to, soon as we get over to where she is. I want paramedics first ones there, thin tough wiry ones. Now you guys hang around here, stay out of the way now, be ready to go when I call ya! - Good man, Ribble, good man. - Go and get her. Look, I don't care what they say, I want to go out there! I just can't stay in here no more! I know you do Sissy, but you know every time you go out there those reporters almost cause a riot! There's a huge crowd. I don't care about that. I want to see my baby, I want to talk to my baby! [shouting reporters] You're endangering the operation, please step back now! Jessica? Jessica? Jessica, honey, it's mommy. Can you hear me? Charlie, shut her down. Shut her down! Shut her down! Shut her down! She'll be able to hear you now. 'Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh, tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff.' Jessica? Jessica? Honey? 'He's Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh, willy nilly silly old bear, Winnie the Pooh.' Baby... [baby noises, singing along] It is 28 hours, now, that 18 month old Jessica McClure has been entombed 22 feet below ground in an abandoned water well. Numerous rescue deadlines have been surpassed, it is no longer clear when they are going to reach the little girl. The neighborhood surrounding Tanner Drive has become a campsite for volunteers, the media, onlookers, literally hundreds, all awaiting her safe return. We'll be here until that moment, and continue to bring you live updates. Rodney Wuench, Big 2 News, Midland. - [doorbell rings] - I'll get it! Sissy, don't open up that door! [reporters shouting] Now, I'm here to help you people! What are you doing in here? Well you see that crowd out there don'tcha? Now that is just the tip of the iceberg. A fella out there is screaming he is from the Enquirer, I mean he's ready to give you thousands for your story! You need me, see because I can handle a fella like that for ya. Now I, I just want to help. Cuz those folks can be brutal, and first off, y'all gonna have to make a statement to the press. Why? I mean we want to thank everyone -- Because that's the way it goes! See what I mean? Y'all don't know nothing about public relations, and that's alright, because I am here to do that for you. Now I got a little something here you might want to read. Go on, take a look, take a look. And here's my card. - Jim White, Midland police. - I'm here to help. Well, I'm sure you are, sir. I appreciate your concern and your desire to help, but you going awful fast, now these folks here just - don't know what hit them. - I understand and I don't want to steamroll anyone! Now you gonna make sure they get my card? Oh yes sir I will. Oookay. He is right about one thing though. Y'all are gonna have to make a statement to the press. And that is just the way it is. Well I'm the head of the family, I guess I'll do it. Chief Roberts, Chief Chech. Thomas Kay, Department of Labor. Mine Safety and Health Division. I'm here to help, if I can. We were told there would be expert help on the way. What makes you an expert? I'm the guy they call after a mine disaster. Explosion, cave in, that sort of thing. I have a lot of experience going down for miners. Dead miners. We can show you what we got. She's down between 19 and 22 feet. We've stabilized the temperature to 80 degrees, and we're monitoring the well for methane gas, carbon monoxide. The rescue shaft is as close as we can get to that whole rig. We decided to cross up to get to the shaft where she's at. You can't do that, you break through you bring debris crashing down on her. And since you can't tell exactly where she is, you might drill right into her. We'll have to go straight across below her. What's beneath her? More well shaft, eighty to a hundred feet. What's to keep her from slipping further down? Nothing that we know of! I think I'm in time, haven't gone too far the wrong way. I want to flatten this drift off. Not angle up to her, but go straight, come up beneath her. You're the expert. Alright, let's go up. You are the expert. He's so shy, I don't know if he can do this. He's been in there for twenty minutes. Chip! I've been practicing in front of the mirror. You can do it. I hope you all can hear me, I'll try to speak loud. I have a statement from the whole family I'd like to make. I would to thank all the help we have received from Midland, Odessa and the Permian basin. I can't mention everyone, but all the free food, it's just unreal. The donations of equipment and labor have been deeply appreciated. For 24 straight hours, men have been down that hole, digging for hours at a time, and some have been down five or six times. It's been great .I don't know what we would have done without all the help. But, but with the Lord's help, and your prayers, we know our little girl's gonna be alright. [yelling reporters] That's all for now, everybody. I'll be back with an update in an hour. What you're doing is excellent. Couldn't be any better. As far as we're concerned, you're now in charge of the underground operation. - We're here to assist you. - Anything you want or need all you have to do is ask, that's the truth. I've never had so much power in my life. First off, everybody in Midland want to help, then seems like everyone in west Texas comes out to help, and first thing you know what they're coming in from Dallas, San Antonio, so like I say anything this man wants! Yes sir, yes sir, he'll get it! Chief! This guy just flew in from New York, uh, claims he's got something. I'm an inventor. I flew down here on my own. I heard about this in the news. In New York? Yeah, New York, America? It's north of here? I got this device. It grabs fabric, it just won't let go. You can pull an elephant with it, if it was wearing a shirt. Alright sir, that's very good, that's very good sir. Well now, we have two groups of helpers here, we... Some people call them kooks, we call them honored volunteers. We got a group right over there, and then there's this group over here, where we might need these people so if you would join them so we could call you. Thanks a lot! You never know. We might need that thing. [Drilling] Officer Glasscock, can you give us an update on the rescue operation? We're digging a tunnel right down, well right below where Jessica's at. it's slow going but we're getting there. So what is it that is taking so long? Well like I said we're drilling through solid rock, and -- You keep saying you'll get her. That's just a bunch of bull, isn't it? - You guys are full of it -- - We're doing the best we can. - You guys are full of it! - We're doing the best we can, - What if you don't get her? - we're doing our best. Come on Andy, what's going on Andy? Come on Andy! Listen we're busting our butts out there - you think we don't care? - What if you don't get her? Okay that's it! Rodney, we're doing everything we can to get that little girl out. Someone's gotta help her, chief. Rodney, you been out here too long. I want you to get home, get some rest, please, alright? I know it's hard. You can't do it all yourself. Go on. Go on. [melancholy music] You did great out there with the press. I did, didn't I? It's gonna be all right. We're all gonna be alright. She's always getting into things, isn't she? Yeah, getting into this, and getting into that. Hey Juicy. Me and daddy love you. Oh, Chip. She's the most beautiful thing that ever happened to us. She brought us together. I don't know what all this means, but I just believe that the Lord has got a plan for us. Y'know, for every one of us, and that it unfolds for the best. That's what I hope. You're slow, and you know it. Just hear me out. I got a hold of a high speed water drill. It's in Houston. The man told me he's in the headquarters of Camp Washington, he said 'hell yes you can use it.' It's got 35 thousand pounds of pressure per square inch, it'll cut through that rock like a hot knife through butter. You're a persistent man, Mr. Jones, either that or I'm getting real tired. I'm just like anybody else, I just want to help that poor little girl. I called the Air Force, they said I could have the biggest transport they have available. But guess what? Federal Express got a airplane, a 727 sitting in Memphis waiting for me, they're gonna fly to Houston, pick up the drill, and bring it right here to Midland. Now time is a-wastin'. Well, what the hell, bring it here, we'll have it for standby. We can land the 727 in the parking lot at the shopping mall over yonder. Mr. Jones, could you land her at the airport, please? - Yes sir. - Much obliged. Now I made a list here of a few little things we're gonna need here. 3,000 gallon water tank. 100 gallons of diesel. Old Boy trailer, 15 ton forklift. They said they could have her out in two or three hours. - Hep and Dole! - Yes, sir! I want you to get this stuff here, all of it. Yes sir. Can do, will do. Go get your drill, Mr. Jones! I'm going home, I'll be right back. Oh, Miss Henry, I hope your car's not trapped. The news people put another satellite dish over there. You know they're beaming this out as far away as Italy and Australia? Biggest news story in the world right now. Let's hope we can give them a happy ending. These guys are sure taking their own sweet time. I'll tell you what too, they're going the wrong way. They missed that well. They could go to Mexico before they get to that little girl. Mark my words, the wrong way. Outta my way! Alright let her go! I want a drilling pattern like this. Use the star bit to punch in holes about an inch, inch and a half apart. We're beginning to get somewhere here. It's been five hours since we heard anything. She asleep? Jessica? Jessica! - Pray she's asleep. - Course she is. Babies gotta nap, don't they? Oh, Manny. Jessica? Jessica? How's progress? Jessica? Jessica? Jessica? Jessica?? Jessica?? Jessica?? Jessica? It's been about forty six hours. She should be able to go longer without water, unless... The dehydration could cause her to slip. She probably is getting smaller. Why can't you go any faster? Why? Why?? Why can't they go any faster? You know they, they just, they hang around they talk and dawdle tell us just a few more hours this a few more hours that while that little baby is down there crying out helpless. Oh god, maybe maybe they don't know what they're doing. Maybe what that guy from Houston's saying is true. What Houston guy saying what? That guy over there saying y'all drilling the wrong way! Chief are you going the wrong way? What kinda bull are you telling these people, get his butt out of here! Let me handle this! You're causing a problem, sir. I want to talk to these people. Hey come on, come here. Alright, I'm going I'm going. Get that gentleman out of town on the first means of conveyance. [Drilling] [radio] Hey, listen to this. Something weird happened. What? Well, the bit kinda went forward and... Did you lose circulation? - Yeah yeah yeah, and -- - The air quit coming back to you, there's no powder or chips? That's it, that's it. The air and the cuttings have gone elsewhere, boys. I think we broke through. Bring him up. [Cheering] Guys, we broke through. Are you alright? We broke through. We broke through. Good. Good. All right. [baby crying] Rod's in, she's awake. Mr. Cay has a steel bar through the well, that means no matter what happens, she can't slip any further. And she was just sleeping. They can hear her, she's awake now. [Plane engines roaring] It's here, it's ready to go, they shipped three experts from Houston to run it! We don't need it. We're doing just fine, we'll be ready to pull her out of there before they can get that gear in. I have to agree. I'm not sure about that rig. The high pressure hits a crack, cracks going the wrong way, that beam of water could race up that crack, slice that little girl. It ain't either, it don't work that way. Look all I can say is it'll save time and we gotta save that poor little girl. Look I'm gonna tell you the equipment is there. You lose that little girl, I'm gonna stir up more crap than you or this whole city can cover up. You ever worked underground before? No sweat. I ain't coming up without her. Well you just widen the hole friend, we'll send paramedics down to bring her up. Thank you though. You men get ready. Yes sir. [drilling] I touched her, I coulda grabbed her. - How's she doin'? - She's mad. Alright buddy. See ya chief. Alright. Alright. It's up to you now. You'll have to slither in here on your back or your belly. - Oh my god. - You all right? Yeah. How did they do this? It's like a grave. Steve? Steve! Steve you out there? Steve! Are you there? I'm here Robert. I'm here. What do we have? God this is tight. Can you touch her? Just barely. I can't maneuver. Jessica? Jessica honey? Juicy, they call you Juicy don't they? Can you hear me Juicy? Man. How did they do this? It's like I'm smothering, I'm buried alive. Is she making any noise, can you hear? Yeah she's wimpering. I can't move, this is awful man. Get hold of her, can you get hold of her? Just barely. I can just barely touch one leg. Come on, move your leg, Juicy. Jessica move your leg honey. Her body temperature's okay though. [baby coughing] Oh my god Steve, it sounds like she's vomiting! Sounds like she's choking. Move your head to the side sweetheart! Jessica move your head, tilt your head baby! Oh god! Please don't let her choke, not now! Can you get her out? Can you even move her? [baby coughing] [baby crying, wailing] Robert what's going on? I don't know, Steve. I don't think we're gonna get her out of here, man. I can't move. I need more room. They say go for her. Well I can't get at her! Robert, try again. I can't get her out! I'm gonna rip her apart if I try to pull her out of here! [baby crying] Jessica? Honey I'm gonna come back for you baby. Don't cry. Please don't cry. I'm coming back for you. There's no way. I don't think we're gonna get her out alive. What is it? We can't get her out, sir. He can't get her out. I need to get just a little closer to her. I could only feel one leg. I can't tell where the other one is positioned. You gotta give me more room down there, I can't feel, I can't get her out. I'm sorry baby. Promise I'm gonna get you outta there. You've got to get a new man. Who else have you got? That guy's a wreck and he's a liability. He should've pulled. Doctor, you weren't down in that well. I'm still not sure. You gotta give it a shot! For that poor little girl's sake! We use it. It's funneling in. The bits can't get a purchase. Keep to the bottom. You think you can handle this? Take me up! You better be able to control this thing or you cut that little girl in half. [TV] It's Friday afternoon in Midland, a time when folks usually rush home to get ready for the big high school football games. Today, the city, America, and the world's attention is riveted on the fate of a brave little girl stuck in an abandoned 8 inch water well. People are showing their support by placing pink ribbons around the city. As exhausted workers continue their vigil at the well head, Jessica McClure began her fifty-sixth hour of entrapment below. Rescuers are using a high speed water drill to cut through the rock. We're told the device is saving a considerable amount of time compared to the tools the rescuers had been using. They're saying they're widening it out, I'm sending down a worker to even out the wall. Alright son. People are saying you shouldn't go back down there, saying you're an emotional wreck. I want the truth, do you have doubts? Are you afraid? Doctor doesn't think you should go. If you don't want to go, nobody will ever know why. I got another try in me sir. I couldn't live with myself, I was so close. Robert, my butt's in the sling with you on this. You'll make it this time. Reporters just told me that something like this happened in California years ago. Radio covered it for days. TV too. Do I wanna know how it turned out? No sir I don't think so. Jessica's been down over 55 hours. This is it. Tell them, doctor. If you have to pull, if you have to break her bones, her arms, her legs, don't worry. As long as her neck back and head are intact, we can fix the rest. Whatever breaks, breaks. Do you understand? We jerry-rigged this from a tripod, photographer gave it to us. You can extend it like that, said you needed something to figure what position she's in. Remember, break her bones if you have to, but get her out. Alright, this is it. Got you a few more inches. If you don't get her now, this is as good as it's gonna get. This is our last chance. We're getting real close. So here's what's gonna happen. The paramedics are going back down. Well I want to be right there when they bring her up. I know you do, but I don't want to create a scene out there. We don't know what she's gonna look like, what shape she's gonna be in. We want to get her to the hospital as fast as we can, you're gonna be right there with her. - Well, I -- - He's right, Sissy. Let them do their jobs. - Okay. - Okay. Hang in there, Juicy! We're coming to getcha! Don't be scared baby! I can't wait to see you. Steve are you there? Yeah. I can still only get one arm up. I can feel her leg. It's cold. Clammy. Please, God. Jessica? Jessica? I can't hear her Steve. I'm jerking her leg. [baby crying] Ah! Ah, thank God. She's still alive. She seems to be straight up. One leg dangling down. The other leg must be straight up the hole. My god. She must be in a split. They sent down some obstetric forceps. They won't fit. They're useless in here. Give me the petroleum jelly. I can't breathe. Smells in here. You're pretty ripe, Juicy. They wanna know what's taking so long. When I'm finished smearing the petroleum jelly on the walls, I'm gonna start. Come on. Come on, sweetie. She won't come, Steve. [baby crying] Oh my god! Oh God I think I just pulled her hip out of her socket! Oh, shh, shh baby, shh. [baby wailing] It's back in now. Calm down Jessica, calm down. They're yelling at me up there, come on, pull her, just pull her! Tell them I just moved her an inch maybe that will shut them up! Charlie. When she comes up I want some security in case this mob surges in you understand? You got it. Alright boys, two lines, right there to the end. Let's let this baby breathe. nobody gets through, nobody gets through. Line up. Steve? Steve? Tell him to pull. Steve! Pull! Pull! Pull, Robert! You can do it! Come on, sweetheart. Come on. [baby crying] She's moving, Steve! She's moving! She's moving! She's coming! Here she's coming! Here she comes! Come on honey! [crying baby] Come on Jessica! Come on Jessica! It's okay baby! It's okay, I got you honey, it's okay, I gotcha. Come on. Come on that's it. You're out Juicy. You're out Jessica. Come here. I'm sorry. It's okay. Send in the spine board, Steve. That's it, that's it. Here it is, here we go. Calm down, okay baby, hi, hi sweetheart. Okay, here we go. I gotcha I gotcha. It's okay, it's okay. Here we go. I gotcha sweetie, alright. [cheering crowd] [cheering, clapping] [cheering people, fireworks] Still gonna catch the football game? In my mind, it don't seem to matter if we beat Odessa or not. See you tomorrow. Get some sleep! [slow music] ♪ We did it. But I still can't believe it. Never a doubt. It was a miracle. I betcha we could walk on that water. Guess not. Let's go get a beer. Here comes another one. Nope. Strike two. Scuse me sir. I'm Rodney Wuench with KMID, can I get your name, and what you did in the rescue? There weren't any names here son, just a lot of good men. ♪ [southern music] ♪
