I'd like to warn those who just turn on this audio commentary, if you haven't seen "Dorm", please adjust the sound to normal. We'll be talking about the film so it might kill the mood when watching. P'Da and Ajarn watched "Dorm" at the theater, right? That's right. When I see "Dorm" in big screen I feel that... the picture that we see here is done with coloring while the version that we see in the theater isn't like this. Really? How could that be? So the version that I saw in Bangkok Film wasn't quite done huh? The second half that you saw was totally different from this one. Not that it wasn't done but the process of doing the file video and film is different. That was the best for film. When it becomes video, we could do much more with the colors. Does it mean that its picture is darker in the theater? The shade of light depends on the projector of different theaters. Like the end of the film where lots of people said, "Where does Tor disappear to while riding in the car with Ton?" Actually he's there, but if the theater is too dark, you can't see him. The opening scene is at Ton's house. - Where did you film it? - I really like this shot. Just a glimpse between them, we know that there's more to be said in the next shot by the maid. It makes us think about lots of things that aren't so good. Look at their facial expressions. I think this is all about the experience of the director. When I directed "Dorm", I had to learn how much was enough. At first I was afraid that it was too long or too short regarding giving hints to the viewers. I think too little is better so that the viewers can think themselves. In the maid shot, when I watch it in the theater, I suspect something, but I don't know what it is. I know later when I watch it the second time what the film hints. As I asked earlier, where did you film that scene? In the suburb of Bangkok, I can't remember where, but it's quite far. The atmosphere is like the old buildings around Suan-Luang. - The house scene, I mean. - That was around Suan-Luang. I remember the gold building. It's the atmosphere of growing up in the row houses, right? My house is just around that area. It's just that the boarding school is in Sri-racha district, so we film it in Sri-racha. Actually we spent lots of time figuring out the school's name. I'm not good at giving names to anything so I let the crew do it. Where does the name "Saichol Wittaya" come from? Nothing actually. One of the crew suddenly wrote this name, and I felt that it was appropriate since the film had to do with water. I tried to tweak it to fit the story. Ajarn Daeng told me that he used to be in boarding school. It was by the sea, not at Assumption Sri-racha but at Bang Saen. I was two years younger than Ton. - So little! - Yes, around 10 years old. Did you have a teacher like Kru Pranee? - Sure. - There's always one in each school. After a while, this type of teacher will be the one we're closest to. We're scared of her at first sight. This type of teacher is so scary. Once we get to know her, we'll understand. I used to have a teacher exactly like Kru Pranee. Later on she became someone I was closest to. That's because she cares about the living situation of the kids. However, at my school, the dorm's teachers were all male. But they were still somewhat creepy like this. When I first wrote the script, I planned to make it all boys school, but I wanted P'Mam. The dorm's teacher then had to be female. I still wondered if the viewers would mind a female teacher in the boys' dorm. I think it'd be worse if it's a male teacher in all girls school. Oh, you'll definitely get criticized! What I don't like is the hairstyle of Ton's father. One thing that I learned from this scene is that men shouldn't wear wigs. So he wore a wig. Why? His hairstyle didn't fit the period? Actually P'Heart's hair is ok. But at that time, men his age - didn't use hair clippers. - I see. P'Heart's hair was done with hair clippers. Men always have problems wearing wigs because their hair is too short to really make a wig blend in with their own hair. I'm not making an excuse. I admit wholly and won't do it again. It looks like a man who has been through hair weaving. P'Heart says that in next film, please don't make him wear a wig. When my parents dropped me at school, I didn't stand and watch. I ran around the car. I refused to go into the school. I refused to go into the school. I ran around the car till the teacher caught me. Ajarn Daeng and I used to be in a boarding school. The first day's experience was really terrible. But after a while, when I got used to the school, and I saw little ones who were sent there crying, I felt so bad for them. But I told myself that after a while, they wouldn't want to go home. It's the feeling that you have to leave home. You have to live with strangers and don't know what will happen, right? Being a dorm's student was like a big adjustment to me. Moving up the grade, moving to a new school or meeting new people, aren't so bad if we're a non-boarding kid because we can relax at home. The change of social life is still bearable. However, being at a boarding school, we'll have to deal with things twenty-four seven. We need to make adjustment no matter what. Is there any difference in the way kids at boarding school and non-boarders think or behave when they grow up? I feel I was more mature because you had to help yourself. Oh, I like this scene... the omelet. The juxtaposition of two similar scenes. From school to home. That's a perfect beat. Changing from one place to another by using food as a link. I spent lots of time with this scene figuring how... I didn't want it to be too clear like in "Fan Chan." I tried to make things more ambiguous in this film. Nack did a great job in this scene. I don't know once I say this, it'll cause the viewers who like Nack's acting to change their mind or not. Actually the tears that you see were the effect of the onions. I really admire him because it's quite difficult to make a boy cry. It's just that he could create an emotional scene with his tears. It's hard enough to cry, but he can also build up an emotion. I remember that this was the last take. When I said, "Cut", my assistant said to all girls not to cry with him. - Nack really gave it all. - I think his paying attention to details improves his acting a great deal. In the last scene, it's not just the crying but also the way he eats. It's really emotional. That's Dr. Nui. This idiot is Sarote. That ass is Pok. I'm Toei. Anyone wonders where Toei comes from and why he disappears? Actually he's not in the Gang of Four. His character is meddling with all. Irrelevantly a bit, I was once a judge for short movies in the year that Bioscope organized. There was a movie about dogs. - This boy was in it? Which one? - The leading actor. Toei? I forgot already. It could be that he grew up a lot. He came to do the casting so I picked him. The lighting in this scene is very good. The lighting comes from below and we know that it's from a torchlight. Boarding school kids always use torchlights when chatting at night. Everyone has a torchlight. The lighting then seems eerie. When I talked to my cameraman, P'Ying, she said I caused her trouble again. To balance the light from a torchlight and the light that was from above was hard. The lighting in this scene is just perfect. The blue color that's surrounding the kids is a set-up, right? Right. If you are at the set, you'll see that this low lighting scene requires a huge light outside the building and then uses the x-acto knife to cut it off. It's like cutting a piece of black cloth. When I was a student, we didn't sit down and tell ghost stories like this. At that time there was a radio show called "True or Fake." They asked the listeners to send in ghost stories and they would make it into a play on the radio. The show was on around 10:00 pm. We'd all be listening to it. My school was new, only two years old. No incident had happened yet. We then had to listen to this radio show. Kids this age do enjoy listening and telling ghost stories. It's like the activity when gathering together. At least these four might not have that good intention at first, but it made Ton get to know them better. Sometimes we get to know people through this kind of stuff. This is a very smooth introduction of a character. It shows each person's personality. I'm not that imaginative. All those stories are things I've heard from other people. I didn't make them up. How much of your own experience is in this film? All detailed experiences are mine. Like the scene when dad dropped Ton off and Ton went upstairs to watch. It didn't happen when I was in a boarding school, but when I became a Buddhist monk. My gang usually went to every members' ordination ceremonies ahead of time like on the eve, and next morning I had to shave my head. My friend would see me off and bid farewell. We normally became monks in the rural. After that they went partying while I forlornly watched. I felt they would be having fun while I had to behave properly. - Here comes the horrific teacher. - She just popped out and disappeared. Scary! I really love P'Mam. She's a very high-spirited actress. I've worked with lots of actors. At first I was a bit uncomfortable because some actors were hard to deal with. P'Mam wasn't like that. She gave it 100%. At first we didn't "know" her. But when we promoted "Dorm", both PR and P'Jina (producer) came to me and said "Yong, make more movies for P'Mam!" Maybe there's a magic genie. I heard that P'Mam always came to the set with lots of goodies. - She took care of everyone well. - She even stopped by the mall to get papaya pok pok for the crew. In the crying scene, do you have to build up emotion for her? P'Mam asked for a moment alone. She didn't need anything to help. She really felt it from the inside. I remember when she was in the film called "Boonchu" in her younger years. There was a scene where she misunderstood Boonchu for dating another girl. She was on the bus and suddenly cried. It was so cute. Everyone says that Jintara can make people cry with her. That's right. The latest film of P'Mam that made me almost cried was "Satang." - When she was with P'Tua. - The dancing scene. That was P'Tua's scene. But there was another scene where she was sitting at a wooden house and having a talk. My heart went right to her. From reading the behind the scene before the film is shown, they says Yong always has temper when directing kids. Why did you deal with kids so much? Actually I love kids and I think they can feel that even though I yell at them. You just need to understand them in order to work well with them. We don't need to act kindly to them all the time. For example, Nack. We don't need to act kindly to them all the time. For example, Nack. After he was in "Fan Chan" and got to work with other teams, I was asked if I still wanted Nack in this movie. They said he became quarrelsome and demanding. When I saw him, he was still the same. It had to do more with spoiling. If we give everything that the kid wants, he'll sure be spoiled. In the set of "Dorm", we filmed until very late three days in a row. Nack came to me and told me that he couldn't do it anymore. I understood him. To film from 6 pm. To 6 am. Three days in a row, was hard for a kid with certain bedtime. I changed the filming time for him. I also told Nack that 60-70 members had to wait for him so he had to do his best alright? It was more like this. It's like trading time for good work. We spent so much time on this not-even-a-one-minute scene. - I spent a day on it. - Why? Actually they say we'd better not deal with kids and animals. But in "Dorm", we have both kids and animals! It's also a technical scene since we can't make the dogs sit in a row. We had to shoot four dogs per shot, and then put the shots together. This is the scariest scene. People are afraid of ghost because they haven't seen it before. We just feel that everything around us tells us that it's there. If you can clearly see it, you might become friends with it. The problem is that we can't see it, and thus makes it scary. - Our imagination runs wild. - Our eyes start seeing things. Waking up late at night and thinking someone is standing there while it's just a shirt hanging. I think that's the beginning of the myths, and when they're passed on, more horrific details start to add up. That's the reason why Asian ghost stories are scarier than those of the Westerns which clearly show their ghosts. Being cold when taking a morning bath is from real experience. But something like seeing a ghost never happened to me. Even the reason why Ton is sent to a boarding school is from my experience. I was teased that I went to boarding school because of that reason. If my dad had done things like that, I wouldn't have put it in the film. Certain points have to be exaggerated to affect the viewers. Your films always have little detail like the next shot. We see Vichien's moldy shorts. This is from my experience. My swim trunks were also moldy. I have to teach it to kids in this generation. We used swim trunks during my time but later on we just wore underwear and washed it at the same time. - Did you take a bath together? - Yes. Long pool like that. I see all the ghost stories made you wet your pants. This is the scene where friends ridicule Ton. When they introduced Ton, the Southern boy said his real name with Southern accent. What makes it funny is that it's not planned. Not intended for it to be clear but the viewers got the point. Not intended for it to be clear but the viewers got the point. If you fix it... can I try playing it? It's difficult to make funny scenes blend in with the storyline. The ridiculed scene stands out the most since it looks real. Like Ajarn Daeng mentioned the Southern accent, it was a character. When the viewers laughed at a character, it was bearable. But this one is intended to be a funny scene. Was it difficult? I have to say very difficult since we don't know what's enough and also people have different views of what they consider funny. - If it doesn't work... - The entire scene will also suffer. If it's not so balanced but it works, that's still ok. I suspected something about the father when watching. Other things were clearer when I watched it the second time. The father appeared cruel and always forced Ton to do things. Also the beginning of the film showed the discontentment of the son about his father. We felt that his father had certain complexity. Later we knew it was because of what his dad did but I still wondered why he had to be so cruel. When I watched it the second time, I felt it was just like all parents who always banned things and kids' memories aren't always accurate. They only remembered the bad things. Chatree isn't here right now. Would you like to leave a message? This scene is the first to tell the viewers of Chatree's last name. I can see now that Yong really isn't good at names. Let me explain. I wrote the script with Wanrudee, P'Keng's assistant and P'Kawao. P'Kawao was the one who put our ideas into words and he was the one who wrote this last name. Everyone knows that this movie comes partly from my experiences and now we need to tweak my last name in it too? P'Keng said to keep it just for kicks. P'Keng also had last name "Jiramalikul" in "Fan Chan", right? These shots are intended. I'm not sure if the viewers get it or not. I'd like them to see the ambiance and the orange light in the bathroom. Boarding schools are really like this especially the ones in rural areas. Just like every family in rural areas, they turn in very early. Everything is dark and the sound of cicadas is all over. Have they met each other yet? Just the shadow while he was hanging the sheet. - While he was playing game. - That's right. You've better memory than I do. I've been with it too long I got blurred. I like this scene because there's no sound effect. There's no music and that makes it scary. In some scenes where you want to build up the viewers' emotion and you add the music to help, I think that's just too much. The silence here... ...and the creaky sound of the door are more than enough. I agree with you. We can't tell much when filming but when watching the entire film, the music in some part is too much. It gives away hints. Just a few ghost tales and he peed his pants. What a sucker! The lighting of this scene is difficult since we have to do the entire building. The wide area isn't so difficult. Though there's light in the bathroom, if we set no light to the building, - it'll be totally dark. - You won't see the shadow of it. The film isn't like our eyes. It can't take on light as much. The light in this scene is from under the door. The room is dark and there's light shining through. It's beautiful. - Very beautiful. - P'Ying must be glad to hear. Did you have to fix the tone color of each scene, i.e., blue or green? We talked about picture and the film a lot before filming. We have to choose the type of film with certain ISO and the brand to fit the movie's color that we want. There's also a procedure for the film that's shown in cinema and the previews in video. We can telescene things in the video but for the cinema film, everything has to be right in it. If we want it to be green, it's got to be so from filming to developing. We used skip beat procedure to skip the developing process. I think this movie is difficult to film. It's a colored movie but you have to play with light and shadow which is the style of black and white movies. You're very good at setting the light and filming it. It's not just that. Sometimes we have to dye white shirts into yellow since white color would burn under the process of skip beat. I learned it the hard way. When you play with few colors, and try to make it like black and white, you have to study about colors a lot. For example, when you see a particular color, it won't be like that when you change it to black and white. It'll turn to be another color. Why do you want it in the tone of green and blue? It's my own preference and it makes the ambiance seem cold. It's perfect for ghost stories. This is one thing that I'll never do, taking a bath alone. He's brave, huh! You're real curious about Miss Pranee, aren't you? Once you wake up, you'll go to dining room right away, right? When I watched the film, I thought he was really disciplined. - He got up and took a bath. - I'd just touch my eyes with water. Another thing that I like is the introduction of Vichien. He appears like a normal kid but the way he pops in and out makes us feel good about ghost. We know that he's a ghost, and he's also a friendly one. I don't know if you used to... Spielberg said that his imaginary friend was Peter Pan. My friends had imaginary friends like Superman. Mine was an invisible man. Kids at a certain age want to have imaginary friends with power. Some might want to have a ghost as a friend like this. - Do you? - I had one too. I'm not sure if it's an imaginary friend, but when I was young, I loved the series called "See Yord Kumarn" very much. I felt I wanted to be like them. I'd do certain things if I have a friend like this. Could there be one more magic thing so I could join them? I even introduced Peter, my imaginary friend to my friends. - You believed it for real? - No. I knew he didn't exist. - But I wanted others to believe too. - It wasn't a joke, right? Nope. I think that's a good point in being a kid. Like the time when I saw the kids playing with dirt in "Fan Chan." They did it for a long time. They enjoy even a simple thing like that. We, the adult, already lost that kind of feeling. Hurry up! Hurry! This is the scene that tortured both me and the geese. We filmed it for a day. It was quite an experience. We know that geese are fierce but only in their territory. When we relocated them to our site, they seemed so tame. Half a day had gone before we figured out that we had to take its gosling. Hold on, please. Yes. The unbearable hairstyle of P'Da. I'll see you later, okay. Sure. I'm afraid of people who did hair weaving. He's more scary than a ghost. I've never seen any man who looks good wearing a wig in a movie. Both the wig and the mustache. Regarding mustache, I once saw a make-up artist who could do fake stubbles. I asked him how he did it. He cut hair and stuck it one by one. It really looked like real stubbles. He was good. It wouldn't look like fake ones either both color and shape. Is Nack this quiet in real life? Not at all! I once saw Nack running down from the 17th floor while the adults used the elevator. We've seen him in "Fan Chan" and then "Dorm", it felt like Jiab had grown up into Ton. Actually Nack is a funny boy. Nack walked down from 17th floor. Thank God he didn't walk up! He used the elevator instead. He's cute. Everybody loves him, especially P'Ying. They teased each other a lot. It's interesting that a serious character works for him. He has sad eyes. Actually we planned to buy the rights for the movie "Pee Gud..." but it was so expensive that we had to remake it ourselves. This is a remake? I thought it was the original. The storyline is close to the original but we twist it a bit to make it fit our film's storyline. The original could also be edited this way. It's good that you did this. So that you won't have problems when importing this movie abroad. I feel sorry for my buddy. He couldn't show his film abroad because "The Little Prince" scene. He could only go to festivals or countries that were willing to pay for the rights of that movie which is very expensive. At first I didn't know that it was a remake until I saw this guy. He looked like a man of our current time. Our budget was quite low, so I had to get help from people I knew, like my younger friends at the university who could act. We employed the department's actors since we had little time to film. If you make a movie, you'd probably ask friends from Architectural Dept. I really thought that this scene was real. The wording on that paper charm means billion. But the wind blew it away, so our chance for a billion was gone. Help! Help me, please! I really like this shot. I like the entire thing because the beats are perfect, both pictures and music. Open the door! Was the director's cut exactly as in the script or did you just improvise while editing? It happened during editing. It only said in the script that this boy was watching this movie. Nothing like this. It happened when I saw the location. We could see so much when filming but we could more when editing. I did the cut for about ten versions. It took that many to get the consensus from everybody. The actions like holding one's breathe and lifting the legs up are from the script, right? Right. It was also a fluke. We were trying to reveal the ghost. How to do it. Actually these two things were in the script, but not together. - Somehow they could be merged. - Same gimmick in Pee Gud, right? Hey... Where'd you go? This scene took place at Assumption Sri-racha school. I also watched movies there as a kid. Every Saturday at boarding school, we'd get to watch movies. In my time, we had to watch soundtrack movies with no subtitles. Khun Bandid and Khun Yingsak also watched soundtrack movies. Mostly Hollywood films. Mostly Hollywood films. Do you think the viewers already know that he's a ghost, or they know it from this scene? When I showed it at GTH, 100% of the viewers didn't know. But when it was in cinema, lots of viewers told me that they knew before. It's normal when you watch a horror flick, you tend to find the ghost. This boy looks the weirdest beside Miss Pranee. I thought about it as I wrote the script because I love horror flicks. That was why I tried to reveal it as soon as I can. It wasn't the main storyline either. Maybe he's looking for a friend. Dr. Nui, how can you believe him? That point is interesting. I believe that some viewers expect it to be a horror flick. When you reveal the ghost, they'll wonder what's next. After this the genre of the movie really changed. I'm not sure if I expect too much or not. I just want to say that there're lots of this type of movie with no ghosts popping out to freak viewers all the time. Maybe something like "Dorm." It's like when I showed the trailer for pre-selling in USA. Lots of people said that it was similar to "Devil's Black Bone." A Spanish movie that isn't a ghost story yet there are ghosts. I think it has to do with the experience in watching movies. The Americans might be exposed to a wider range of movies, so they understand different storylines better than we do. I was told that this shot had nothing to do with the movie. I agreed since it had nothing to do with Vichien and Ton but I insisted that we included it in the film. I was trying to say that Miss Pranee had something to do with the boys. I asked them to keep it. A few minutes ago we revealed the ghost. Here's what's next. We now know that it's not a ghost story anymore. There're shots where Ton and Vichien each appear alone. It's like another storyline. And when we see Miss Pranee alone, we understand that something crucial is about to happen. When I showed it on the blank face round without Q&A, Kong (Lidia) told me how daring I was in changing the film's genre in the middle of the movie. I didn't think that it would be this clear while filming. It was just something we had to try. This scene is a bit routine for any horror movie. All of a sudden, there was a hand and later appeared to be a dream. It could wake up the viewers. This is an additional scene. We added more ghost scenes to please the markets. When he knew that his friend was a ghost and became friends again, I wondered if the viewers would think it was too lame or not. I also wondered if I should explain the story more or not. That ghost scene was about what Vichien asked Ton in the theater whether Ton was afraid of him. Once Ton knew that his friend was a ghost he started to think what a ghost could do to him and started dreaming. When he woke up, his friend is still a friend. Yes, sir. Which movie has the boy who plays Vichien done before? Michael did lots of commercials and TV series since he was little. Lots of commercials. He's really popular in that field. Just like Get in "Fan Chan." Has anyone wondered why students don't wear uniforms in class? None at all. In boarding school, there is time for homework, after dinner, etc. - After a bath and dinner, right? - Yes. It's interesting that nobody's curious about it. They're more curious about things that I never thought about. For example, the door lock was outside. In the script, I planned to have kids play tricks on Ton by tying a rope to the door. My assistant suggested locking it. What toilet has the lock on the outside? My crew said it was like that in his school. I then went to see the toilets at Assumption school, they were exactly like in the movie. I think the purpose is to keep things out of the toilets. For the janitors to lock the toilets during breaks, thus helps create pranks among kids. Here... I fixed it. You wanted to borrow it, right? I think this conversation is a bit too mature for kids. - Which scene? - This one coming up. When Vichien said how he and Ton were alike. It's too mature but it's an important point in the story. "I'm nobody." I made him say it behind Ton. Try playing it. This is a very sad scene. I don't know how. We know that he's afraid and he only has Vichien as a friend. It's just so sad that he has no one but a ghost as a friend. When you cut back to Ton's house, we know that Ton's not there now. But it makes me feel that Ton already knew that he was never there. Shit, he's gone off the deep end. Actually that scene wasn't right there in the script. My editor tried putting it there and I felt it worked. It gave me a chill. Like he knew he didn't exist even before he came to boarding school. Ton felt like a nobody not because of his friends but his family. Um... right now... can you still see the ghost? After this is what my friends called "Nui's Ghost Busting." If you see it again... you can tell me about it. I like ghosts. - Nui had more roles than others. - It would lead to scenes after this. About the motorcycle. P'Kiang said I skipped back and forth too much. What does he want me to do! I'm surprised with this scene. P'Kawao wrote that Nui sat on the coffin. I didn't think much when I told him to sit on the coffin. I didn't think that it might be funny or anything superstitious to sit on a coffin. People thought it was bad luck but I wasn't thinking at that time. When it's in film, P'Keng said that it really worked. When it's in film, P'Keng said that it really worked. I don't know why but it worked. It looked different. He replied slowly in the style of his character that "I like it!" Are you making fun of me? Nui's character was set to explain something. I was scared that I might give too many hints. However, it had to be clear. I had to choose whether to add a character. So I chose to have a character who was a weirdo from the beginning on. You should put Vichien and the dogs in the same frame. - Did you film them separately? - Yes. I like Michael in this scene. He acted elegantly at first then he changed to being a kid. I have to confess that I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out because in the script, P'Keng said he wanted to see this scene. No director could have done it alike. In the script, Vichien wanted to try something. He stuck out his leg and all dogs howled. When he put his leg back, the dogs stopped howling. Before filming, I told Michael to have confidence. It was like telling myself to be confident too. Is something wrong with the food? Nack's eyes were really sparkling in this scene because of Taew. That was the real feeling. The food is great. The dogs' scene did change the mood of the film too because the mood of what came next totally changed from previous scenes. Khun Visut said that this is "Fan Chan" part 2. The high school level at Assumption Sri-racha was coed during my time. There were always cheerleaders for every competition. So I added it in the script. At certain age, boys tend to like older girls, but not that old. When they're turning into teenagers. Could it be that they feel the girls - their age are too innocent? - Something like that. They prefer older girls. An illustrated guide to becoming a man. In this scene, I told Nack to use his thumb to circle it. Nack's brother was there. I asked him if his parents would mind. - What did he say? - He said not to worry. Maybe he does that often at home. Hey... what was he called in for? My crew thought up the name "Obsession" for the magazine. People do think that boarding school kids might be obsessed with sex, especially about homosexual because they're put together. There're some but there are much more things to do at boarding school. Your friends would ask you to go play things or do some adventures. Totally lots of things to do. We're not obsessed with sex at all. - There're some but nothing serious. - Just like non-boarding kids. I think we should be more concerned with non-boarding kids. They're alone after school and have access to hypermedia easier. If anyone has a nude magazine, everyone in the school gets to share. That was why Vichien called it his priceless cache. Climbing out to see things is one of the activities for dorm's kids. It's a really normal thing. The story behind this scene was that there's a girls' school called St. Paul's Convent right next to my school. All girls are cute. This song by P'Nui is from my own preference. I'm a big fan of the band Micro. There was a song "Yar Dee Kwa" in the last part of "Fan Chan." This scene doesn't really have any point to it. It doesn't state clearly which period this movie is from. But lots of things are chronologically done according to the director's age. Like the comic book about "Tsubasa." Also going to Sri-racha via Bangpakong. The eyes of these 2 boys were really sparkling. At first we were filming another school's scene but the light dimmed we had to film this shot instead. They were actually done at the same school. Want to take a picture? - She was giving hope to Ton. - People asked why P'Namtan had to... How should I put it without making it ugly... Let's say giving hope to him. I think it's just the point of view of a boy which came from my experience at that age. - For them, it was just friendship. - They didn't think anything nasty. - He felt P'Namtan was happy. - My mom said when I was young Because sometimes I would show girls' pictures to my mom and they were all older than I was. Boys are really like this. Hey, can I ask you something? Shoot. I like this beat too. It took him a while before he could ask... - I wonder what he would say. - Writing script for this phrase was difficult because I hadn't seen the entire movie. I usually send the script to my friends for comments. One of my friends said if he knew that his friend was a ghost, he'd have asked since day one how his friend died. I agreed at that time, but the beat and the pacing of the movie had to be around here. I had to do everything to make it believable to the viewers. It was towards the end, we had to make them believe us. Sometimes the mood of the movie leads us on. One of the hardest parts for me was that Michael had something to do every 6:00 pm. These scenes had to be done at dusk. "The magic hour" when the light is really beautiful. That timing is so short that we could only film a few shots per day. That's why we see the lighting change so much in the film. If there were no clouds, we had to film during the day and then turn it into that magic hour during post production. However, we fixed that problem so everything went smoothly. Another thing about film and video, That timing is really the magic hour. When we see it with bare eyes, we think it's dark. But it's really clear in film. Pen, follow me downstairs. This is the shot where dad came down with P'Pen. This is the viewer's discretion part for all younger viewers. - This isn't a good thing. - Which isn't good? - To hide under the table? - To do what the father was doing. It should have been done in private. When I came out of the theater and talked to my friends, lots of people didn't think that it would be revealed like this. The father seems to have a complex, and the son seems to hate him. Some people think that the son might have been molested. At the beginning scene where Ton looked at the maid, I thought he had a relationship with her! Wow, this family... What kind of a family is this?! I could understand that the father did things shamefully. Though his son was about 10-11 years old, parents still think of them as kids. That was why he didn't think that his son was old enough to understand. Where have you been? I like Jintara in this scene very much. She stormed angrily at Ton, and it looked so real. When the camera captured others, they all looked frightened. They were all startled and wondered what Jintara was doing. Other kids never thought that P'Mam would really hit Ton. They were all startled. They only thought that Miss Pranee would only rebuke Ton. It looked so real, especially if we thought about... Everyone probably had a teacher like this. I don't know why! Actually this teacher really cared about kids but sometimes she couldn't keep her cool. Also the way people show affection. Nack is becoming pubescent. His nipples are getting bigger. P'Da is laughing so hard. In some scenes, we could see his mustache too. It can be seen in some shots. Yeah? Well, where did you disappear to? You said no one cares about you. How about yourself? You wrote about this sentence, right P'Da? - You read it too? - Yup. P'Da wrote a column about Vichien and Ton in Kor Khon Magazine. I got lots of calls on the first day the magazine was on sale. They said P'Da wrote a review for your movie. Were you worried about putting that sentence in the film... - Quite so. - If it was too much for kids to say? I was worried. On the day that we filmed it, Jack and Ball came to help at the set. I then asked Jack to act out that scene for me. I wanted the kids to concentrate so I didn't want them to rehearse it. I asked Jack to act out that scene in different moods. So I knew which mood would make it believable. Should he say it nicely, or should he say it angrily? I decided that the burst out yelling was better because what he said was too mature for kids his age. I was lucky to have an award-winning star to help me. It's a good idea to use anger since they were mad at each other earlier. When you were in school, did you use "Sima Lotion" (for fungus)? Nope. I wore underwear ever since I was little. I was used to wearing it. At my school, when we were cheering a sports competition and it rained, - we still had to remain there. - Right. It'd be kind of damp. We would feel the dampness all day. "Sima Lotion" then became an essential cure in the dorm. My friends did use it, but I was used to wearing underwear and the humid feeling a long time ago. Do you have any sima lotion? Did you have many choices on how to resolve the story? When I was watching it, I thought about it in many different ways. I think it was the same as any viewer on how the film would resolve. - Whose father are you talking about? - Vichien's complex must have started because of this type of father, but actually it wasn't. Our script is more complicated than this. Our script is more complicated than this. When we wrote the script, we had to brief things as clearly as possible. When we hadn't seen the entire picture, we tried to explain a lot. Regarding the father, there are lots of explanations... About Miss Pranee's way of protecting Vichien, yet disaster still happened. Also Miss Pranee in the current day cutting newspaper clips. After we edited out those scenes, the movie was still comprehensible. - You had already filmed them. - We couldn't tell from the script. Many times I had to add or delete the scenes, I felt like a failure for not realizing it from script. My friend came to me and said "Believe me, they all did it this way for any good movies." You deleted more scenes than you used. It's like buying a box set of "In The Mood For Love" by Wong, his deleted scenes are much longer than yours. I read that after Wong finished filming and tore down the set, he watched his movie and was unhappy enough to rebuild the set for filming. Movies are something that you need to see in the whole. When we saw the sweater scene, we weren't sure if the viewers would understand or not. I learned a lot from making this movie that when it's a mystery, you'll have to conceal certain facts. Sometimes viewers don't get our hints and get confused. The other time, we gave out too much information that it lacked its charm. You need experience to know how to balance things. I feel that I couldn't get all the information from the first view. You then know the purposes of each complex when you re-watch the film. A few minutes ago, that was at Assumption Sri-racha. But the entrance of the school was shot at Rajburi. Here we were at Korat. Filming business is like this. This one is especially difficult because it skips back and forth. Every actor has to remember his previous scenes. Hopefully not from last week! Everyone has to work really hard for this movie. Michael does a great job here. It looks like he's drowning. He was in real water but we erased the water. It took me 4 days to film this shot. The background is in Korat, and Michael is at Thammasart's pool. You filmed Michael in a real pool using green screen. That's why it's so realistic. I was wondering if you used the sling. But his acting looks better than acting with a sling. The previous scene was great. This one is seen more often in drowning scene. I rarely get to see the other one though. How did you come up with that picture? The idea. It started from the point that he had to drown himself in a pool that had many drowning incidents before. I got the idea from when my friend drowned, a seer told us that his soul was still at the pool. We needed to pray for him. I borrowed that story to use with the character of Vichien. Unfortunately that the pool in Korat was abandoned and had no water. P'Ying and I got the idea of this picture after seeing the location. After we saw the location, we realized how we wanted it to be. The fact about places where there occurs repeated deaths is just like that motorcycle scene. Or the turntable. People say that you should make a ringtone out of that record. - We do have it. - Really? It'd be so scary as to when you'd answer the phone. - People really use it? - Yes. It was GSM promotion. There's also Nui's voice saying, "Why don't you answer the phone?" Nowadays there are many interesting ringtones available. Two years ago there was a ringtone saying "Kirei ne." With the Thai meaning (you're ugly), not the Japanese one (you're cute). They used Film Rattapoom's voice. They could make ringtones out of any current hits. I don't know if the viewers think like me or not here. In earlier scenes, you'll see the camera focuses on this spot. Giving the illusion that there's something spooky in the bathroom. Giving the illusion that there's something spooky in the bathroom. Now that everything is resolved, we have to resolve the bathroom scene too. I really like this scene. I really like Jack. I see the improvement in Jack also. He's different from other child stars. Just like P'Mam who gets better in every take with various styles of acting that we can choose from. However, for most child stars, they tend to get worse with every take. - They won't look natural anymore. - The best take is the second one. Jack is really professional. Very talented. He's much more funny than you see in the movie. We didn't kill the rabbit. We only knocked its socks off. It was completely out! Do you have to take this class? When I was in tenth grade at St. Gabriel school, I had to dissect a rabbit. Other schools might do the frogs but my school does the rabbits. That's because the organs of a rabbit are bigger and easier to see. - What did you have to dissect, Ajarn? - I did a frog. - How come I didn't get to do it? - Did you take Biology? Oh, it's in the high-school courses. I was in Social Arts Dept. This rabbit really looked dead. What the! I was startled while filming that shot too. I didn't expect it to jump up like that. Though the rabbit is unconscious, There are certain ligaments in the legs that when a vet touches them, it'll cause the reflex action of jumping. Here is the place where I think there's too much music. It gives away the scene. Normally with this kind of ambiance, I like it to be quiet, cold and eerie. You'll get to the depth of the viewers' feelings. Vichien! Don't jump! This not-even-a-minute scene took me four days to complete. These two boys weren't acting together in this shot. The drowning shot of Michael was the same as we saw a while ago? We filmed it on the same day but in separate shots. Here Nack had to act with a green ball. He had to do a dramatic scene with an object. Where did you get the idea that his soul had to leave his body in a specific way to help Vichien, and how it was linked to the lab at school? This was P'Keng's idea that this movie should be based on kids' ideas. Our movie was based on kids' ideas since the beginning. For example, the Chinese movie "Pee Gud...". Leaving the body to save his ghost friend is definitely not an adult idea. It has to be in a specific way to show that he really loves his friend. That's the way he learns to be more mature. What about the Ether? I did research with my friend, a pharmacist, that the only way to make two souls meet is through being unconscious. We then think about the lab at school and the experiment with a rabbit. I did research on the effect of Ether. Help! Help me! Hey! Tira is drowning! This is the abandoned pool where we filled it up with water. We spent hundreds thousand baht for the water alone. Everything cost money. The production itself was so costly that people asked why. We didn't use CG or anything fancy. Just this type of filming. I got the color reference from a Japanese movie called "Eureka." The entire movie is in this color. Very pretty. I like it. If we use this tone for the entire film, no one will come watch it. Our viewers prefer colors. Help me! Go ahead and save him. But he could be faking it. I feel sorry for the character in this scene. In a group of friends, there's always one who gets mistreated. He's quite left out. This is a good way out for the movie. The kid didn't kill himself. If it was so, you might be criticized. This is a very good way to solve the problem. Hey, I'm leaving now. Before Vichien told how he died, Before Vichien told how he died, Nack asked why he killed himself. He said he didn't. He died in a more stupid way than that. I think it's funny. It's like telling the viewers that don't expect the ending to be as scary as you might think. It fits the theme well that he wants to be noticed by his friends - but don't really get it. - I wish others think like you! I intended for it to be this way but didn't give away that much. Vichien! This teacher is so cruel. Her mood really swings. I used to ask P'Mam if she knew Frank Sinatra's song "My Way." It's doesn't have anything to do with the storyline but... We all want to do good things but in our own different ways. Miss Pranee's personality is like this. She only needs some understanding. Just like Ton's father. He loves his son, but he does bad things. He wants his kid to understand and return his love. There's one scene of Miss Pranee's that I like very much. It's her office when Ton sees the picture. There's a picture of Vichien sitting next to Miss Pranee. It's like Ton was mesmerized. And then comes a turntable which gives a hint about being hypnotized. I like the feeling that Ton was pulled into that picture. But how come you have to drown... over and over like this? To die repeatedly. I don't know. Not the kind of question that people ask. I don't know myself. But it's really cold at the bottom. The dialogue between the two is like that of any normal kids. Once in a while, they say things too mature for their age, but we don't really notice that. Like being invisible. I just realize the jacket scene from my second viewing. I wonder if it has anything to do with Vichien being cold. You got it right. This film is good that the script is very detailed which is difficult to do. You need to balance it well. - So intentionally. - Just an unimportant minute detail. The driver flew off his bike and died instantly. After that... I'd hear the same motorbike... skid around the corner almost every night. I really like Nui's voice. - He's scarier than ghosts. - Perfect for telling ghost stories. When I wrote the script, I didn't plan for Nui to be this way till I got to meet him. I said he was really believable. I was lucky in that scene that I got good location and great art team. If Nui didn't say it in a correct way, it would have failed miserably. There's got to be people who're afraid yet want to watch it. It seems so much like a routine that he brought noodles with him. We moved the heck out of there. No... How do we help the spirits get reborn... so they stop re-enacting their own deaths? Ghosts and humans occupy separate worlds. It doesn't seem like they could understand each other. One is so serious, another is somewhat out of this world. - Does the real Nui talk this way? - Not at all. - He has perfect look for his role. - Also talks this way from scene 1. Mile is somewhat quiet but not lifeless like this. He talks like that's his normal speech. Could be that we filmed it at 4:00 am, and he was sleepy. Is this the one you like? The sound effects and all were perfect. I had to bring it out earlier for fear of forgetting it. Vichien should be Miss Pranee's pet, right? - Right. - Vichien... I like the picture, sound and the content of this scene. Ton... swear that you won't do it. The more I see it, the more I want to work with P'Ying in my next film. P'Ying said no more ghost stories. She did "Shutter" then "Dorm" and after this will be "Alone." She wants something cheery for a change. Shit, the other day you said he wasn't strange. I know. You see that it's pretty dim in this scene. However, we have soft lighting in front of the actors. The light was so close to their faces that Mile fainted. The light was too bright. We couldn't tell from watching that you needed to prepare so many things. The view is even nicer from up there. Water tank. Boarding kids have to climb up the water tank. Every school has it too. That's because the water supply isn't good in the rural parts. We need to reserve water in a tank, and everyone has to climb up the tank. Chatree has disappeared. We filmed this shot for many days during many different times of day. We filmed this shot for many days during many different times of day. Running from one end to another. Playing during dinner again? I thought that you filmed this movie at only one school. I don't feel the change of locations. Is there a... ...what do they call it... Railway's Warehouse? - Not at all. - One shot looks like a warehouse. Railway's warehouse like the one that's around Jatujak. There's one shot where you filmed it inside the building. I think filming movies in provinces is fun. It makes the staff closer to each other too. So I always try to get out to different provinces. My producers won't be so pleased to hear that. Like boarding kids. Live, sleep and party together. What are you talking about? Splitting spirits from what? He told me himself... that he wanted to help his friend that drowned in the pool. I suggested he could if he split his spirit from his body. We changed the cutting of this scene so many times. In any chasing scene, if you move even a bit, things change. Khun Visutr helped me in this scene. It's necessary to have helpers during editing, right? The director himself might be confused with all the beats. Director or anyone who works on a film too long will get blurred. So much so that you lose touch with it. You need others to help edit. It's not really a theory, but it's better not to do your own editing if you direct it because you won't get any fresh perspective. We'd only think one way. With outside help, we'll get more ideas. There are directors who don't want to film on location. Just let others do it from the script, and they'll do the editing. That's the kind of director who doesn't want to wake up early. When Peter Jackson was filming "Lord of the Ring", sometimes he wasn't at the set. He'd be at the hotel, and the set would send the pictures to him via satellite. - Was that because of too many units? - Yes. What do we do now? I tried to add kids' way of thinking like "What's next?" - They had no idea. - I think it's also funny because of they way they broke into the pool and argued a bit. Hey... let me out! Normally Nack doesn't like to make ugly faces. He asked me to let him off that scene. I begged him for only one take if he concentrated well. He had never done that kind of scene before. Was there any feedback from anyone who didn't like the last part? That instead of a horror film, it turned out to be about friendship. Only a few. Maybe they didn't like it so much they didn't want to tell me. I think they didn't say anything because they like "Fan Chan" a lot. Only a few people would regard this movie as a horror film. They might think that it's a horror film but the feeling they get isn't so. It's more about friends. I've got to leave now. Last one was "Fan Chan". This one could be "Fan Chan" (My Friend). I've been with it for so long that I didn't think much about it. For people who came to see a horror film, they didn't seem to be too disappointed that it wasn't so. But there were some who did mind. Everyone understands the feeling of friendship. So no one said we tricked him to watch it. During the preview for our focus group, they said that this movie was not really a ghost story. The narration flipped back and forth. They think the target group would be working people and Univ. Students. But it turned out to be lots of kids and teenagers. I asked them why they liked it. They said it was their kind of movie. Good answer. Ok. Next time I'll make more movies for your generation. Nack looked filthy in that previous shot with nose dripping and all. About the music, I really like this scene. Just the sound of a piano. It looks so free and relaxing. My inspirations! All those still life pictures. I never knew our school was this big. This shot was taken on a prop tank, but it was really sunny that day. The kids were hot but they had to look relaxed like it was breezy. Ball, Ed and Ping were helping me at the set on that day. They started doing strip-tease dancing to cheer up the kids. That was why the kids were tongue in cheek while talking. It wasn't the last scene of filming, right? The last ones would be the underwater scenes. Feel free to consult me, okay? But don't consult me, okay? Let me be the first one to consult you then. Why the heck do you speak with a lisp? The ladder is actually at the front, but it's too far to see. I've never been up the tank. The kids didn't know the way down. That's the real cloud. We can see the difference between the film and video. Since the range of film isn't wide enough, you only see white color. DJ Koi was cheering Nack to run faster in this scene. That was why his eyes were sparkling. Be patient, Toh. Let him pack his things first. - The little one is cute. - He's got another project already. Have you been eating enough food? You've gotten darker. And lost weight as well. When we do any period film, the fashion is always out of place. Like the mother, her hairstyle doesn't really blend in that well. It looks like we do it intentionally. Doesn't look normal. Almost the last shot. I like it very much. - Which one? - The last shot. I like the picture in that scene. Dad... I like this school now. Dad's face is so dark. Must have driven long under the sun. I told my crew that no make-up for actors. I can't stand men wearing make-up. Another thing I like is that there's not too much talking in this film. Simply "I like this school" explains it all. Vichien didn't kill himself. His drowning was really an accident. We filmed this shot at 4:00 am. P'Mam could still concentrate well. - What about Nack? - The same. P'Mam had to act all day while Nack only had this shot. For breaking your record player that day. With the lighting, I couldn't tell that it was 4:00 am. Could Nack remember anything from the movie when he was one? Not at all. P'Mam told us that Nack spoke his first word at the set. He said "Tion, tion". He got it from the word "Action." I asked P'Mam to change her acting for each take. She can sure change. For the first few takes, she looked quite tensed. Miss Pranee might have been like that. However, the actress in this scene should look relaxed. When I told her, she could do it instantly. It was a Friday afternoon much like any other. But something had changed inside of me. When you have to deal with kids or non-professional actors, a person like Mam can help control the beat. This is my favorite scene. We only see two people, but the viewers will add Vichien to it themselves. I didn't know... what adventures the next term had in store. I could feel it in the script. But when it's in the film, I feel so much more. Try figure adding Vichien in the picture, it'd be great. You have to let the viewers use their imagination. Like the main leaders are floating in the sky after death. The end. It's not something that I can do by myself. It's not something that I can do by myself. This list of people are those who helped me in making "Dorm": P'Mam, Nack, Michael, etc. I'll probably use the same crew for my next project. In filming, you have to work with 60 people or so. We know each other so well that I don't want to adjust anymore. Don't forget your director of photography. P'Ying, right? She did a very good job especially with the lighting from very bright to very dim. She's excellent. You can see that directing pictures improves the mood of the film. P'Ying, Niramol, is great with quiet movie. Here's P' Soviet for production design. That's our logo. Our end credit is very long. Thai people don't recognize it much since we don't have the tradition of reading the end credit. I realized that our end credit was so long when I was at Festivals abroad. They won't turn on the light till the end credit ends. I feel sorry for the viewers when watching GTH's movies. Where do you plan to distribute it? We'll definitely go to Pusan. Unfortunately a person who selects Asian movies in Cannes couldn't help us much even though he liked this film a lot. If you want to go to Cannes, you can't attend other festival before. Unless they're really interested in your movie which is rare. And our movie was shown in Singapore already. We made 15 million Singaporean dollars which is about 70-80 million baht. Next country will be Hong Kong. The same time as we'll release DVD. Too bad that we could only show it one time at Bangkok Film. They wanted foreigners and presses to watch it but... That show helped me a great deal. Lots of people wanted to buy it. Their purpose of coming here was to watch Thai films. That's why we had to do blank face. The song "Yark Bok Krai Sak Khon" was actually in the storyline. In the scene after Ton went to see Dad and Miss Pranee and walked away. This song supposed to appear at that moment but P'Keng and others said that it was too distinctive. The picture was clear enough without the need of the song. At first I took it off the project but we needed a promotional song so we used it. Khun Visutr then put it at the end credit. Do you release soundtrack that includes these old songs? We only had the score in the DVD box set. Ms. Sawalee's song "Duangjai" wasn't what I intended to use. I planned to use the song "Krai Nor." - I ended up using this song instead. - Good choice. We planned to use "Krai Nor" in only one scene. It'll be really funny to put "Krai Nor" at the end credit. Think about Ton wearing the sweater his dad sent him while that song was in the background. It'd be really funny. It would be really funny. See? The end credit is mega long. I think it's important because you can't make a film alone. Without these people and places, there wouldn't be "Dorm." In some films, they use University students too. That's it. I'm really happy that Ajarn Daeng, Kiattisak Suwannapokin and P'Tida Plitpolkarnpim join us in the commentary of "Dorm." Thank you very much. Thank you.
