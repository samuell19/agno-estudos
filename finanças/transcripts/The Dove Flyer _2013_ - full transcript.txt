The Dove Flyer (مطير الحمام מפריח היונים) Farewell Baghdad Baghdad 1950 ﻿Kabi, what will we do? Where's Nuri? ﻿Snoring. Where's Father? ﻿He's not here. ﻿What happened? ﻿Uncle! Uncle! ﻿Don't be afraid. Sshh... ﻿To the apartment! Adnan! ﻿Leave him alone. What did they do to you, Uncle? ﻿Kabi, don't be afraid. Rachelle... ﻿Hazkel, what have they done to you? ﻿How can we help him. -Move outta the way! ﻿Caution his wife. We don't have time for her. ﻿Rachelle, my love. ﻿Good evening. ﻿You mean good morning. ﻿Jews, you exhaust us. ﻿Dealing with you all night long. Where are the weapons? ﻿Weapons? We have no weapons. ﻿Where's your husband? Out fooling around? ﻿What do you want from us? ﻿If you don't mind, Ma'am, we'll conduct a search. ﻿Where's Father? -Please! ﻿Muhammad! Search! ﻿Adnan, over there! Go on! ﻿Nothing there. ﻿Adnan, to the traitor's house. ﻿Madame... ﻿Stay here. ﻿Colonel Hamid! ﻿"Shafik Ades is hung by the government of traitors." ﻿Some balls your uncle had. ﻿That's enough! ﻿Hold on? Where's your father? We must see to HazkeL ﻿Don't be afraid, we'll see to him. ﻿Adnan! To the basement! -Go on, you sonofabitch. ﻿Find anything? ﻿Nothing. Jews' garbage. ﻿Take him away! -No! No! ﻿Fuck these Jews! -Hazkel! ﻿Hazkel, my brother, ﻿what's going on? -Now you come?! ﻿Come, child. ﻿What's going on? ﻿Hamid Abdel Aziz. Colonel. ﻿Betraying the king, Mr. Amari. Have you no shame? ﻿A command is a command. ﻿Sweetheart, eat. ﻿I'm not hungry. Tell me, why Zilkha? ﻿A Jew won't do any good. ﻿She hasn't eaten a thing. Not even a cup of tea. ﻿Zilkha studied law with Father. He has connections. How do you know. -I won't let you go if you don't eat. ﻿Change your clothes. ﻿Look at you. ﻿Have you eaten. -I'm not hungry. ﻿You need your strength. -I don't have an appetite. ﻿Just kill me. ﻿Take it. ﻿Do you know why Hazkel was arrested? ﻿I'll tell you why. It's because of this newspaper. ﻿This newspaper landed Hazkel in jail. How can someone oppose the regime ﻿and get himself in so much trouble. ﻿Mr. Zilkha, we want you to help us find him. ﻿What drew him to Zionism? ﻿Why did he go down this dead end alley? ﻿We're not here for that. ﻿Then what are you here for? ﻿He was arreste an we on t now where he is. ﻿All you do is lecturing us. ﻿If there's a trial, Madame Rachelle, I'll be the first one there. ﻿What kind of lawyer is that? ﻿You went to school together. Don't you know he's worthless? ﻿Father, he talks a lot, he's arrogant, ﻿and his face is all yellow from cigarettes. ﻿Are you done? Dezi! ﻿You should be ashamed of yourself, talking like that. ﻿Do you know how many lawyers I begged? ﻿And you, as soon as you see me you pout. ﻿Am I not human. Is Hazkel not my brother? ﻿It's my fault, I sinned! ﻿What kind of man are you? ﻿I'm sorry Kabi, I can't do this. My heart is exhausted. We need a good lawyer, not that creature. ﻿Yes, Hazkel is your brother, but he is a diamond and you are coal. ﻿I am coal? ﻿Are you listening to me? ﻿There is not other lawyer. There isn't! ﻿Everyone's afraid of the government. ﻿Zilkha is one of us. Don't underestimate him. ﻿Father, if we find a better lawyer, ﻿one we can trust, ﻿I assure you Rachelle will calm down. ﻿Go see Abu Saleh tonight. ﻿He wants to talk to you. ﻿Dezi! ﻿Hurry up! ﻿What's going on? ﻿Who is he? ﻿Fuad, from Israel. ﻿Listen up, Kabi. ﻿Things got out of hand because of your Uncle HazkeL ﻿What does he want from me? ﻿Talk to me and pay attention! ﻿I'm not saying we must not save your uncle. We must, only right now we have a more important task. ﻿Abu Saleh said you would cooperate. ﻿You suggested me? -Kabi, people are frightened. We must come together and do what we can for the movement. ﻿I'm sure you understand what you must do. ﻿Move the radio, dear. ﻿Hold it. Like this. ﻿Look what your uncle Hazkel has done. ﻿He got us all in trouble. ﻿Take this to Abu Saleh. Go. Good morning, Kabi. -Good morning. ﻿Regards from Father. ﻿And how is your Aunt Rachelle? -Broken, miserable. ﻿Poor thing, we must help her. -Mother doesn't leave her side. ﻿I have to go to school, Abu Saleh. ﻿Bless your hands. ﻿It broke my heart to hear about your brother. ﻿What can we do? God bless him and keep him safe. Look who's here. God bless you, Kabi. ﻿What do you think about your uncle? ﻿Kabi, you'll be late for school. ﻿Let him hear this. ﻿We Jews should stay out of this. ﻿Salman, I'm no prophet nor son of a prophet. ﻿But how many times have I told you? You're like a brother to me. ﻿I told Hazkel to be careful too. ﻿Only God knows what will happen to him now. ﻿Please, Abu Adwar, leave it alone, my head is exploding! ﻿Go on, Kabi, get your brother and go to school. ﻿Kabi. Sit down! ﻿Tell me, is this place so bad? ﻿Do your friends think it's bad? ﻿Are we deprived in any way? ﻿70 kinds of dates, honey, sour cream, fish, meat, everything! ﻿Do you lack anything? Go there, what will they feed you? ﻿Weeds and potatoes! Where will you live? ﻿Father, can I say something? ﻿You both know Iraq lost the war in Palestine ﻿and now they're getting back at us. ﻿No way. Shafik Ades was hanged because he smuggled weapons. ﻿He would have been hanged even if he wasn't a Jew. ﻿Now you're a judge too? That's enough! ﻿I warned Hazkel so many times not to denounce the government. ﻿You know how many times? ﻿Did he listen? ﻿Go on, Kabi, go. ﻿Enough with this nonsense. ﻿I'm not saying another word. -I suggest you don't. ﻿No more talking politics with you. -It's best that way. ﻿Backgammon? ﻿You're all indifferent, scared. ﻿Everyone thinks they're right. ﻿You too, Salman. ﻿No one will let you leave, especially not to Israel. ﻿We must change this regime together with the Muslims. ﻿The camel doesn't see its hump until it breaks its neck. Communist! Uncle, we're not in class. -Enough already! ﻿Rachelle, they'll find Hazkel in a few days, you'll see. ﻿Why is God torturing like this? ﻿Hear O Israel. The girl is lost. ﻿Your food is the best, Auntie. Bless your hands. ﻿How about you, Nuri, are you as diligent as your brother? ﻿What are you learning in school? ﻿Not about Stalin, Uncle. ﻿Rachelle, please, stop crying. ﻿Have you heard of Kareem Abd-EI Hak? ﻿The one who tried to save Ades from the noose! ﻿The officer's brother. He has ties to the government. ﻿I see. What about him? ﻿He's pro Zionists and Communists. He's one of ours. ﻿Your father knows him from university. ﻿He likes to drink. ﻿I've never been here. ﻿It's so beautiful! ﻿What a beautiful world! ﻿So, can you help us? ﻿With what? -My uncle, HazkeL ﻿It's complicated. ﻿You Jews, some of you are troublemakers ﻿while others rot in jail Isn't a shame the beautiful Rachelle is all alone? ﻿Only you can help us. ﻿Talk to your brother the officer. ﻿I did and I made some phone calls. ﻿Where do the people go that the CID kidnaps? ﻿The cellars. -Damn them. ﻿Here you go, drink up. ﻿This is grilled chicken, we just slaughtered it. ﻿Bless your hands, Abu Saadun. ﻿This is what I'm talking about, ﻿the hard life and the beautiful life slipping through our hands. ﻿Times we will never get back. ﻿Isn't it a shame, your beautiful women left all alone? ﻿My dear Kareem, we take care of our women. ﻿Wait for me. ﻿Nuri, don't forget your food. We made progress. ﻿I can't tell you, but many things are happening. ﻿You're talking nonsense. Go to school. ﻿Don't you get it? There's a good chance Hazkel's alive! ﻿If he's alive, 'm sure I won't get to see him. ﻿Mother, did Father tell you what we did yesterday? ﻿What could he have to tell me? ﻿Dezi, this needs ironing. ﻿Hi, Kabi. ﻿So that bastard Kareem found HazkeL ﻿Where is Hazkel? Where could he be? ﻿In the cellars, humiliated. -Did Kareem talk to him? ﻿Father, I'm hungry. -Just a second! ﻿Can he be trusted? Maybe he's playing a double game. ﻿That's enough! ﻿Kabi, we looked for hope and we found it. ﻿Father. ﻿Did your mother make you breakfast? -I ate it. ﻿All he does is eat. ﻿Kabi, I haven't seen you smile in a long time. ﻿You see, your uncle is alive. ﻿You want a zangula? -No. ﻿I don't get it. Nuri! ﻿Rachelle, trust in God. What joy! ﻿Kabi, Hazkel is alive! My Hazkel is alive! ﻿God will reward you. Will you come with me? ﻿now w ere e is. Will you come? ﻿Don't let her go alone. Father sent Kareem the lawyer. ﻿Damn him, he is so handsome, like a movie star. ﻿I think he's very smart, like HazkeL ﻿Maybe even more. ﻿Remember? Kareem was here a year ago. ﻿Hazkel invited him over. ﻿When I saw him this morning, I nearly fainted. ﻿Kabi, Kareem found him! ﻿My Hazkel is alive! ﻿Say "Allah is great!" ﻿Allah is great! -Long live The King! Long live Iraq! ﻿Oh, my beloved son! ﻿Allah is great! ﻿My poor son! ﻿Allah is great! -Allah is great! Long live the king! -Long live Iraq! ﻿What did you do? What demon made you go there? ﻿How could they have known? ﻿Didn't I tell you to look out for Rachelle? ﻿Kareem knows where Hazkel is, but he didn't see him or talk to him ﻿and you run over there as if you don't know what's going on. ﻿Salman, it's my fault. ﻿Kabi went with me to keep an eye on me. ﻿What a boy. What a good soul. ﻿They're happy. Relax. ﻿Can't you see they're happy? Hazkel is alive, that's all that matters. ﻿And you, didn't I tell you not to go out dressed like that?! ﻿Where do you think we live, in London? How I dress is none of your business. I'll do as I please! ﻿Salman, leave her alone. -Leave me alone! ﻿This is between me and her. Get out of my way! ﻿Poor thing. He never wanted her in our family. ﻿Her beauty is deadly. God keep her and us. ﻿Father should treat her like a daughter. ﻿Never, but never hate your father! ﻿Your father is wise and honest. That's enough for now. ﻿Nuri, go to bed! ﻿Hello. Please sit down. ﻿Now that we've found your husband, I might have a solution. ﻿Why can't I see him? ﻿Not now. It's complicated. ﻿Do you know how many prisoners there are? ﻿Dozens, hundreds. It's not an easy task. ﻿Please, get to the point. ﻿If you agree, especially you, Rachelle, ﻿I have an assignment for Kabi. ﻿Kabi, are you as brave as I think you are? ﻿Brave? ﻿I picture Kabi as a tea vendor. ﻿The streets are full of them. ﻿One of them will come in soon and you will observe him, Kabi. ﻿What does he want from me? ﻿That you disguise yourself as a tea vendor. ﻿He'll get you in to see Hazkel, you see? ﻿True. -True. ﻿Here he is. ﻿Watch him. Serve the tea. ﻿Did you see him? How is he? ﻿He's fine. We barely talked. ﻿I volunteered for this assignment. ﻿Your father and uncle are like brothers to me. ﻿You talk a lot. ﻿Kabi! ﻿Figs, dates, ﻿cookies and cigarettes. ﻿Father is waiting for you. ﻿May God be with you. Amen. ﻿It's like a school play, but without an audience. ﻿My love, you are the crown on my head. ﻿I made this rose water. ﻿Bless your hands. Here. ﻿Be careful. ﻿May God be with you. ﻿Where are the cigarettes? ﻿Your uncle should be hanged! ﻿Hazkel! Amari! ﻿Kabi. Kabi. ﻿Uncle, how are you? ﻿How is everyone? ﻿Well. ﻿And Rachelle? ﻿Don't touch the boy! ﻿You should thank me. I brought him to you. ﻿Bastard. Have you no respect?! ﻿He needs a doctor. How many times must I say it? ﻿He needs the angel of death. ﻿When the revolution comes, we'll hang you like a cow! ﻿You animal, slave of a rotten regime! ﻿Jew food! Cigarettes! ﻿Go ahead, eat. Have some. ﻿Have some. ﻿What's happening outside? Did you see Abu Saleh? ﻿Abu Saleh suggests lying low for the meantime. ﻿On the contrary! Tell Abu Saleh to forget I'm here! ﻿Comrades. Long live Commumsm. Long live Soviet Russia! ﻿They'll hang you. ﻿Arise ye workers from your slumbers... ﻿That's the Armenian, leader of the Communist underground. ﻿For reason in revolt now thunders ﻿And at last ends the age of cant ﻿Arise ye workers from your slumbers... ﻿Kabi, do you remember what I said? There's no stopping a revolution. ﻿But we are not a revolution. ﻿We are, and how! ﻿Not Stalin's revolution, ours! Herzl's! ﻿No one wants to leave Iraq. ﻿Don't worry. We have assignments, Abu Saleh knows what he's doing. ﻿He isn't telling you because he considers you a child, ﻿but I trust you. ﻿I am not a child! ﻿What should I tell Rachelle? ﻿Tell her I am well, tell her not to worry, ﻿tell her I'll be out soon. Lie to her, tell her there won't even be a trial. ﻿Don't worry. He is well. ﻿Rachelle, he asked about you and told me to tell you not to worry. ﻿But how is he? ﻿Kabi! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿What's with the robe? Are you a tea vendor now? ﻿Stop it! -My brother Adwar is crazy. ﻿Everything makes you horny. ﻿What's going on, children? -Father! ﻿Leave me alone with Kabi. ﻿Kabi, I want to talk to you. ﻿Don't you tell Father I'm active in the movement! Never! ﻿Someone once asked the sage: "Where is your wisdom from?" ﻿He said: "From the lunatic." ﻿I'm not as educated as you are, but with the little mind I have, ﻿I can tell you there is no blessing in your actions. ﻿They'll hang the Communists one by one ﻿and you Zionists... -I am not a Zionist! ﻿You're a Zionist and how! ﻿You don't even know they're playing with you. ﻿They'll tell you to replace your uncle at the paper and denounce the regime. ﻿You'll tell the Jews lies about "the good life" in Israel. ﻿It's all nonsense. ﻿Israel doesn't belong to us. Israel belongs to other Jews! ﻿Abu Adwar. You have connections in high places, right? -I do. ﻿You sell pigeons to all the wealthy of Baghdad, even the government. ﻿Now you're talking. ﻿Can you help us with Hazkel? -No! No! ﻿Why not? -Leave me out of this. ﻿I sell pigeons to whoever wants them, Muslims, Jews and Christians. ﻿They stuff the pigeons with rice and I stuff my pockets with money. ﻿It's my job. Father, leave him alone. ﻿Shut up! Cheeky. ﻿The pigeons love you. They're crazy about you. ﻿At least the pigeons love me. ﻿Stop it. My Amira loves you. ﻿I love you too. ﻿You're a smart kid, Kabi. ﻿Abu Adwar! ﻿Abu Adwar! -I'm conning ﻿Where are you? ﻿Salman, I wanted to tell you something but I forgot. ﻿Good. No politics tonight It's off to Abu Saadun's for some fun. ﻿I didn't say a thing. Kids, don't be back late. ﻿Are you conning. - Yes. -Come on then. ﻿Did you hear my father? ﻿What is he thinking? How can he go out at a time like this? ﻿Listen, Salim suggested I ask you to join us. ﻿Communism?! No way! ﻿You don't see what's happening in the world. ﻿If we don't plan a revolution, we'll sink here ﻿and nothing good will come of it. ﻿Do you hate the Zionists that much? ﻿Don't you care what happens to my uncle? ﻿He's my uncle! Stop it! ﻿Let it go. Let's relieve the tension in our balls. ﻿Big talker... Better we go to the movies. ﻿Talk to me once you've screwed a woman. ﻿I pity our teacher. ﻿Since Salim hooked up with Stalin, he has no time to fuck. Poor man. ﻿What is it with you? Do you want a revolution or a fuck? ﻿Listen to you. ﻿Revolution and fucking go together. ﻿Last year there was this teacher from London, ﻿a hot blonde with blue eyes, ﻿Salim fucked her until smoke came out! ﻿That's your revolution? Fucking? ﻿"Fuck a lot, don't linger, ﻿"Because pussy is tastier than honey." ﻿Virgin for sale, 50 dinars. ﻿She goes to the highest bidder. ﻿Virgin for sale, 50 dinars. ﻿Madeleine... ﻿Virgin for sale, 50 dinars. ﻿She goes to the highest bidder. ﻿Virgin for sale, 50 dinars. ﻿50! -Who bids more? ﻿55! -Who bids more? ﻿-60! Who bids more? ﻿65. ﻿65! Who bids more? ﻿70. ﻿70 dinars! Who bids more? ﻿70 dinars! ﻿70 dinars! Congratulations! Enjoy! ﻿You lost! ﻿I made two revolutions with one whore. ﻿Father. ﻿Salima, come join us, eat something. ﻿Thank you, Abu Saadun, but it's late. ﻿Mother doesn't have to know I was here. ﻿But she does know. ﻿Keep your voice down. ﻿This is the handsome son you're always talking about. ﻿What is she talking about? ﻿Forget about it. Forget her, she's a singer! ﻿Here today, Cairo tomorrow. ﻿Your assignment is to look after your uncle ﻿and leave me alone. ﻿Look around you: ﻿Abu Adwar, my friend - I don't trust him. ﻿Abu Saleh - I have no issues with him. ﻿Abu Saadun - He's a Muslim. Don't believe any of them. ﻿Not even Abu Saleh? -Not even him. ﻿Shame on him. Him and that Bedouin with the owl face! ﻿Stop it, Father, you've had enough to drink. ﻿Enough? One small glass. ﻿Let's go home. Enough, Father, enough. ﻿What time is it? ﻿Bye, guys. -Goodbye. ﻿You going to sleep? -What can you do? ﻿Take care. ﻿Don't open the shop tomorrow. ﻿Father, is it true you want Kabi to replace you in the pigeon business? ﻿I wish. If he wanted to. ﻿top it, mira. m ere to see war, not the pigeons. ﻿What about me? Aren't I a pigeon? ﻿Adwar says you're in love with your uncle's wife. ﻿Your brother Adwar is dreaming. ﻿And you? ﻿What about me? What do you think of Rachelle? ﻿All I care about is my uncle. ﻿Liar! If I were you, I wouldn't take my eyes off her, ﻿especially when you see her every day. ﻿Amira's flirting with you, is she Kabi? ﻿No, she's not flirting with me. ﻿She's a little pigeon herself. ﻿Don't you think she's pretty? ﻿Go on, marry her. ﻿I'll talk to your father, Naima will talk to her mother. ﻿We'll forget all about politics. ﻿Abu Adwar, we're kids. ﻿Who wants to get married? ﻿Good morning, Abu Adwar. -Good morning. H﻿ow are you. -Thank God. ﻿I'm taking Kabi to work with me. What do you say? ﻿Adwar, my rebel son, has become a Communist. ﻿He doesn't distinguish between sacred and secular. ﻿Look how the pigeons love him. ﻿Even my Amira has her eye on him. ﻿What do you say? ﻿Let's marry them and set up a room for them on the roof. ﻿Only one room? Two. ﻿Enjoy. ﻿God bless your hands. ﻿Relax. ﻿Abu Saleh picked her up off the street after her family kicked her out. ﻿I wish everyone was as loyal as her. ﻿But that's not what I want to talk to you about. ﻿I'm glad you found HazkeL ﻿I have faith in that lawyer of yours, he's one of us. ﻿But another catastrophe is about to happen. ﻿The leader of the Armenian underground will be executed tomorrow. ﻿That will be the end of the underground. ﻿I don't understand. Why are you telling me this? ﻿We have to step up our efforts. ﻿Prime Minister Nuri Said, damn him, wants to destroy us too. ﻿Could you please get to the point? ﻿Ben Gurion has expedited the Jews' departure to Israel. ﻿Make a list of everyone who's willing to leave, ﻿and wait for instructions. ﻿I don't have time for this. ﻿I'm more concerned about freeing HazkeL ﻿What are you thinking?! ﻿Hazkel is lost to us. ﻿I won't give up! ﻿Abd-EI Hak whom you gave us his word. ﻿And I believe him. ﻿Listen to me, Kabi. ﻿You can no longer act on your own accord. ﻿You're part of the movement now and you'll do as you're told! ﻿Boys, get to class! ﻿Kabi! ﻿Get Adwar and come see me. ﻿Who is helping them escape to Israel? ﻿The Communist Armenian was hanged, the pressure will be on the Zionists. ﻿How are they leaving Iraq? ﻿Ustaz Nawi, I am not a Communist and I know nothing. ﻿Adwar, are you a Communist? ﻿Me? So so. ﻿Boys, boys. Find Salim Effendi and warn him. ﻿Your families are being watched, especially Salim Effendi. ﻿Relax, Salim. ﻿Uncle Salim, we must smuggle you away at once! ﻿Then what, Kabi? What will you do? ﻿Hazkel is finished. Lost. ﻿For your own good, stop this. Look out for yourself! ﻿There is no more hope, not for us and not for you. ﻿A truck is leaving for Iran in a few days. ﻿Wait here in the meantime. ﻿I'll manage. Trust me. ﻿Now get out of here, fast. ﻿Hey, gorgeous, where too? ﻿Kabi! ﻿What's the matter with you? ﻿Are you insane? You're killing me! ﻿Let's go. ﻿Where were you? ﻿None of your business. ﻿I saw you walking around the Muslim quarter. ﻿Why don't you answer me? ﻿Have some tea with me. ﻿Why are you walking alone in the streets? ﻿Stop it! You're not my husband. ﻿You're the most beautiful woman in the world. ﻿What did you say?! ﻿Nothing. ﻿Let's have some tea and tell me about yourself. Hazkel always said you're a better journalist than him. ﻿But now you're a spy. ﻿The world is burning! They're looking for the Zionists! ﻿Do you understand what I'm saying? ﻿You asked for it. All of you! ﻿You destroyed our lives with your underground. How can you say that. The land is burning! ﻿Once you found Hazkel, that was it. ﻿What will you do now? You and your smart friends? ﻿We'll save him, by force if we have to. ﻿I'm worried about you. ﻿I don't want anything bad to happen to you! ﻿Kabi, trouble sticks to me like flies. ﻿Your father makes me so mad. ﻿He still hasn't come back. ﻿I wonder where he is. ﻿And I'm mad at Rachelle. -Why? ﻿I saw her walking the streets alone. ﻿When? -Today. ﻿Poor thing, she went to see Dr. Fauzi. -Fauzi? ﻿She's has stomac pain for 2 days, poor thing. ﻿Leave her alone. She's busy with her own affairs. ﻿Yes. "Leave her alone." ﻿All you ever tell me is: Come and go, come and go. ﻿Darling, don't make such a fuss. You're still a child. ﻿I am not a child! ﻿You are my life! You've become a man! ﻿Watch over her. ﻿She's like a little girl... She is alone in this life. ﻿Good evening. Candied almonds. ﻿Hi, Nuri. ﻿Why isn't your mother saying hello to me? ﻿What's new, Kabi? Helping the Communists now? ﻿Stay away from them. Let them kill one another. ﻿Father, they'll kill Salim, your cousin. -They won't kill him. ﻿Did they catch him too? -Almost. Wh﻿at business do you have wit Salim. What did you do? ﻿How many times have I asked you to keep Kabi out of this. ﻿Out of what?! ﻿Get off my back, let me eat in peace. ﻿Father, calm down. You too, Mother! ﻿You have no idea where you're living. ﻿Instead of being angry, help us. I need you. ﻿What happened? You want to tell me something? We need money. Salim and his friends... ﻿Listen, Father. You dream of going to Israel. ﻿This will make you happy. ﻿Tomorrow we're taking people by truck to Iran and from there to Israel. ﻿Kabi, give me the money. ﻿I'll be right back. ﻿Kabi, am I not the most beautiful girl in the world? ﻿In the whole wide world. ﻿What are you doing? Whore! ﻿You bastard! Why my sister? ﻿Stop it. -Let her go, she's a big girl. ﻿Are you crazy?! Don't fight! ﻿Surrender, you mindless Commumst. -Kabi, that's enough! ﻿Look at this, Adwar. ﻿Fuck you, Kabi! ﻿Come on, uncle. ﻿Come on, get on ﻿Take care. ﻿See you. ﻿Amira. -What are you doing? ﻿What does it look like? ﻿Adwar! ﻿I'll wait for you. Where will you wait for me? ﻿Israel is small, ask around they'll tell you where I am. ﻿Take care of yourself. ﻿Nice job with the truck. ﻿Your first time shaving yourself? -Yes. ﻿Make sure you don't cut yourself. ﻿You will be a real man. ﻿Even Rachelle will fall in love with you. ﻿Father, stop it! ﻿I'm joking. ﻿Are you ready to visit Hazkel? ﻿I'm ready, Father. ﻿Tell him the good news, go slow with the bad news. ﻿The bad news? ﻿There's bad news too. ﻿Israel isn't sending any airplanes, the families are laughing at us ﻿and time is working against us. ﻿But you pretend you don't know a thing. ﻿Juliette! ﻿May your house burn down, you whore! ﻿What's that screaming about? ﻿You whore! ﻿Where's my daughter?! Who smuggled her? ﻿I don't know! -Tell me the truth! ﻿I'll kill you! -Maybe the movement. ﻿The movement? Maybe Abu Saleh. ﻿You knew everything! You were in on it! ﻿That's enough! ﻿Damn your father and mother to hell. ﻿Give me the knife. -You whore! ﻿Are you insane? What's with you? -Naima, save me! ﻿Get in the house! ﻿What happened? ﻿Salman, my daughter ran away. My dignity is lost. ﻿What will become of me? ﻿That's enough. ﻿My sun as gone out. I can see nothing. ﻿What's with this bread? ﻿I swear, if I don't kill Abu Saleh, don't call me Abu Adwar. ﻿Stop it! I'll kill him! ﻿Give me the stick! That's enough! ﻿You had your eye on my daughter. May you go blind! ﻿If she's the right age, why not? ﻿Once you're dead, I'll piss and shit on your grave. ﻿Shame on you! You monkey! ﻿What's the matter? ﻿You're asking me? You bastard. ﻿You leave my mother in her grave. ﻿I'll bury you too! ﻿Stop it. Abu Saleh, go inside. ﻿Damn you. -That's enough! ﻿You smuggled her away and you slept with her?! ﻿That's your daughter you're talking about! ﻿Shame on you. What are you doing? ﻿Here. Read it! -What is it? ﻿"Father, I have gone to Israel, forgive me, Amira." ﻿So, what do you want from him? -It's his fault. Scum bag. ﻿If I don't inform on you, don't call me Abu Adwar! ﻿No. No! Calm down. ﻿Please, Abu Saleh. ﻿A Jew would inform on a Jew?! ﻿ave you gone ma Stop it! ﻿You call him a Jew? A Muslim is better than him. ﻿You call him a Jew? ﻿You won't have her. ﻿As long as I live, she will never be yours! ﻿Calm down. -I hope you die! ﻿Give me the stick. Give it to me! ﻿The police are on the way! Stop it! ﻿You have a family to support. ﻿Take care of your son. ﻿Sonofabitch! I'll kill him, then I'll kill myself. He's all you have left. Fathiya! Fathiya! ﻿Get inside. ﻿Come, brother. ﻿That's enough. ﻿I hope no one was hurt. ﻿"There's no blaming the insane, there's no reprimanding the drunk." ﻿Abu Adwar was offended. He took it very hard. ﻿I miss you all. ﻿The neighborhood, the life we had. ﻿And sweet Rachelle, how is she? ﻿Hoping for the best. ﻿What do I know? Maybe I made a big mistake. ﻿Don't blame yourself, Uncle. ﻿You see, I'm here, everything's going as planned. ﻿I saw Fuad twice ﻿but I still don't know what they're doing for us in Israel. ﻿When you see Abu Saleh again, ﻿tell him it's time for phase B. ﻿And Rachelle, watch out for her. ﻿Blue eyes, like a diamond. ﻿That's enough, boy. ﻿Go, go! ﻿Take care of yourself. ﻿Next visit you won't find him here. ﻿He's being moved to another unit. ﻿Kabi, you're overreacting. ﻿Overreacting?! I saw him. He can't stop crying. ﻿Rachelle, I saw him before Kabi and I got a different impression. ﻿What will happen now? He must be half dead. ﻿Sit down. Let's have a drink. ﻿Do you know something we don't? ﻿Are you asking or telling me? ﻿Leave this to me, I know my job. ﻿Kabi, I think you should be working with Abu Adwar, for your own good ﻿and smile, you're a man. ﻿Kabi, a pigeon keeper? ﻿I'm not joking. ﻿You'd do wisely. ﻿It's a job that will keep you safe. ﻿You'll see I'm right. ﻿Rachelle, ﻿Hazkel will be home before winter. ﻿Kabi, where's my son? He didn't come home. ﻿I haven't seen him in a few days. ﻿Where is he? ﻿Please, go look for him. ﻿I'm afraid he'll get caught and something bad will happen to him. ﻿What am I? A toy? "Go look for him." ﻿Abu Adwar, even if I find him, he won't come back. ﻿Come. I have something for you. ﻿Take this, put it in your pocket. ﻿May you break your neck! Where have you been?! ﻿Do you want to kill me? ﻿Isn't it enough you smuggled out your sister?! ﻿Forgive me, Father. ﻿You kill me and then ask for my forgiveness? ﻿Let go of my hand! Let go! ﻿I know this salary is like pocket money. ﻿I'm making a feast for kings out of these pigeons. ﻿There's not a family in Baghdad that hasn't tasted my pigeons. ﻿Only the wealthy. ﻿I asked you here because I'm catering a feast at Abu George's house. ﻿We don't like him. ﻿You think I like him?! ﻿One must make money to live. ﻿You've never seen such wealth. ﻿He's so rich and he's one of ours. Come in. ﻿Abu Adwar -Hello, Um George. ﻿How are you? -Well, thank God. So so, you know how it is. ﻿Where is your son, Adwar? ﻿He's busy. ﻿I brought Kabi, Salman Amari's son. ﻿Welcome. ﻿Your father sewed our clothes. ﻿He has the hands of an artisan. -Thank you. ﻿Where should I put this? -Right here. -Good. How many people should we prepare the meal for? ﻿Abu George, of course, count me out. ﻿And Nuri Said with his secretary. ﻿Nuri Said?! We throw a royal reception for any Prime Minister. ﻿Of course. ﻿Are you familiar with Nuri Said? ﻿A world renowned figure. ﻿But poor thing, they're using him. ﻿Gladys. -Hello Abu George. How are you? ﻿Tonight's meal must be extra special. ﻿Gladys, did you tell him who's coming? ﻿Of course, darling. -She told me. ﻿Well then, come with me. ﻿You haven't seen anything yet. ﻿What am I supposed to see? ﻿Do as I do. Serve and shut up. ﻿Next year you will work alone, I no longer have the strength. ﻿My heart is exhausted. ﻿Wow, great hot pickles! ﻿Prime Minister, how many times have you headed our government, ﻿three, four, five? ﻿Am I right, Dr. Rashid? ﻿Who's counting? ﻿The world is changmg and so are we. -Right. ﻿No one knows what tomorrow will bring, ﻿not even Prime Minister Nuri Said. ﻿Thank you, Dr. Rashid. ﻿Thanks to people like you, our regime remains stable. ﻿Abu George, ﻿these days are trying and the decisions even harder. ﻿You are among the first to hear what I have to say. ﻿After we hanged the damn Communists, ﻿only you Jews remain, but we have nothing against you. ﻿There's no reason to be against us. ﻿We Jews are very loyal. ﻿My friend, Abu George, I invited myself here ﻿to hear w at you t in about my decision, ﻿that you Jews be allowed to leave. ﻿You will receive permission and you will leave this country. ﻿But I warn you, Abu George, and you will warn them for me, ﻿those underground movements. -God forbid. ﻿We have nothing to do with the underground. ﻿There will be no forgiveness ﻿for the leaders. ﻿The undergrounds are turning you against us. ﻿Esteemed Prime Minister... ﻿We Jews are part of Iraq. ﻿I don't know many Jews who will want to leave. ﻿Abu George, you're like a brother to me. ﻿The decision has been made. ﻿If you don't leave of your own accord, we will drive you out, ﻿or the masses will turn you into dog meat. ﻿God forbid, Abu George, what will become of us? ﻿Abu George, you and your family will stay here, ﻿I take you under my wing. ﻿Businessmen i eyou, you belong with us. Come in. ﻿What happened? Talk fast! ﻿Good news! ﻿I'm in the middle of something! I though it's the secret service. ﻿You won't believe who Abu Adwar and I met today. ﻿Son of a dog. ﻿I saw Nuri Said in the flesh! ﻿You're drunk. ﻿I've told your father not to let you drink. You're a child. ﻿I'm not drunk. Listen. I was in Abu George's mansion. ﻿That Jew is a thief, a crook and a snake. ﻿He made money at our expense. ﻿You don't understand. ﻿Forgive me for barging in. -Talk. ﻿I heard Nuri Said say he intends to send the Jews of Iraq to Israel. ﻿Then the rumors are true. He wants to drive us out. ﻿But that's what we want, isn't it? ﻿You don't understand. ﻿This government and Nuri Said, may God eradicate his sperm, ﻿want to steal our property. We won't flee like mice. ﻿Now go! ﻿Get it out of your head. We won't leave Iraq, not today and not tomorrow! ﻿Kabi, is it official? ﻿Neither my children nor I will leave. ﻿Get the cotton out of your ears! And you, did you swallow your tongue? ﻿Your Hazkel is burning in jail. I'﻿m not going anywhere until Hazkel comes back. ﻿Rachelle, it's over. ﻿Come with us to Israel and wait for him there. ﻿You go alone. I'm staying here with my ancestors... ﻿You're worse than Nebuchadnezzar ﻿and all my enemies! ﻿Don't touch me! ﻿There is none like our God, there is none like our Lord, ﻿There is none like our King, there is none like our Savior. ﻿Who is like our God, who is like our Lord, ﻿Who is like our King, who is like our Savior. L﻿et us thank our God, let us thank our Lord, ﻿Let us thank our Savior. ﻿Gentlemen, may I have your attention. ﻿The hour of truth has arrived. We shall not flee. ﻿Sell your possessions. ﻿Withdraw your money from the bank, remove it from under the floorboards. ﻿Abu Saleh, we object to all this talk. ﻿Listen to me, we will never flee. ﻿Who made you the almighty? ﻿Gentlemen, listen to me. ﻿One must know when to shut ﻿Kabi, hurry up. I need vegetables. ﻿Your father forgot to go to the market. I guess he's not that hungry. ﻿Take some from me. I'm going. ﻿Wait. Change your shirt. You're all wet. ﻿Naima, Rachelle! ﻿What happened? ﻿I brought you some Turkish Delight. ﻿May it be your will, Lord, God of our fathers, ﻿may this be the last laundry. ﻿Calm down. ﻿Count me out. ﻿What's wrong with her? Why the sour face? ﻿And you, isn't it about time you smiled a little? ﻿We'll be in Israel soon! ﻿So we heard. Mother, we have no choice. ﻿Father is selling the shop. -I sold it. ﻿What's the rush? -Yes, I sold it. ﻿What's the rush? How will we live? ﻿Did you forget your brother is rotting in jail? ﻿Naima, our time here is over, don't you understand? ﻿But Father, will the airplanes be here on time? ﻿That's enough. Spoilsports. ﻿Move. I'm going to the shop. ﻿I swear on my children's eyes, we will not leave without HazkeL ﻿Go tell your aunt. ﻿I can't deal with her anymore. I've had enough of her. ﻿Kabi, the market is closing. Who are you waiting for, God? Go! ﻿Kabi, Kabi. ﻿This is the second time we meet. We don't deal with children, ﻿but tell me, what kind of child are you? ﻿I'm not a child. -Did you say something? ﻿Kareem Abd-EI Hak. ﻿What? You are Kabi Amari, not Kareem Abd-EI Hak. ﻿Ask him. I didn't do anything. ﻿Why don't you keep on doing what you did last year? ﻿Was it all a lie?! ﻿You wrote such a nice essay about our homeland. ﻿Who taught you to write like that? Your uncle Hazkel? ﻿I didn't do anything. ﻿You're running around, meeting with Jews. ﻿What for? You help your youths flee like mice in the night. ﻿I don't know what you're talking about. ﻿That's enough! I know him! ﻿Stop. ﻿Should I go on? ﻿What did I do? ﻿You're inciting against the king, against the government. ﻿Nuri Said himself said.. ﻿First we'll punish your leaders. Smelly dogs! ﻿Kabi. ﻿Kabi... ﻿Menashe, ﻿what have they done to you?! ﻿Menashe! ﻿Guard! Guard! ﻿Doctor! Doctor! ﻿He needs a doctor! ﻿Slowly, slowly. ﻿I waited for you all night. My heart stopped beating. ﻿Why did I send you to the market? ﻿What have they done to you? ﻿All this for my HazkeL I wish I were dead. ﻿If not for Kareem, my brother, your son would not be here today. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Kareem, can I offer you anything? ﻿Forgive me, I'm in a hurry. ﻿I'm telling you, this is the last time I do this. ﻿Be careful. ﻿You are Jews in this country. ﻿Kareem, my brother. ﻿How can we repay you? ﻿2000 years, gone with the wind. ﻿Vanished into thin air. ﻿Our life is over, Salman. ﻿If you love me, Kabi, ﻿promise you stay away from those crazy people. ﻿Mother, it's not us who are crazy, it's them. ﻿How can I convince you?! ﻿This is no life for a child. ﻿Where is everyone? Where is Rachelle? ﻿God knows. ﻿She fell in love with that damn Muslim. ﻿Nonsense. That can't be true. ﻿Where are you going? Do you want to kill me? ﻿Kabi. ﻿I was telling Rachelle what I'm planning. ﻿Kabi, I didn't want to wake you. ﻿Kareem is trying to free Hazkel as soon as possible ﻿so we can go to Israel together. ﻿You said you wouldn't help us anymore! ﻿These things take time. Aren't you going to thank me for getting you out of prison? ﻿Thank you. Rachelle, let's go home. ﻿What do you want from me? ﻿Now that there's hope, you've changed. ﻿If you were an Arab, I'd have to kill you. Traitor. ﻿I am an Arab. ﻿As much an Arab as me.. ﻿You're like a jealous husband. Hazkel wasn't like that. ﻿Too bad you didn't learn from him how to treat a woman. ﻿Call me a traitor again and I won't talk to you ever again! ﻿I'm not blind. -There's nothing going on between us! ﻿Kareem is our friend, he is truly concerned. ﻿Do you know what he offered me and I refused? ﻿That I go to Israel with you and he'll make sure Hazkel follows. ﻿I've had it. You hear me? ﻿I'm done chasing after all of you and worrying about you. ﻿I'm especially sick and tired of you! ﻿Kabi... ﻿Poor thing. ﻿Your heart is like stone ﻿It does not pity me... ﻿Kabi. Come here, son. ﻿I brought you your treasure. ﻿What are you doing here? -Looking for you. ﻿Sit down, have a bite to eat. ﻿You can drink tonight too. ﻿Your father allows it. I'm responsible. ﻿Father, Mother is not doing well and Rachelle is furious. ﻿What's wrong with your mother? ﻿When I left the house everything was fine. ﻿I heard Mother tell Rachelle that Hazkel will never get out. How does she know? -Rumors are going around. ﻿Mother says this is no time for you to be out enjoying yourself. ﻿Kabi, it's a holiday. The giving of the Torah. ﻿Our exodus of Egypt! Go tell your mother, go! ﻿She sent him to spy on me.. I'm going! ﻿Sit, my child. We are all sad, Kabi. ﻿You think your father is having fun? ﻿Some things you cannot see, Kabi. ﻿Here, have some Araq. It will open your mind. ﻿Drink up, my dear son. ﻿Your father has gone to say goodbye to Salima. ﻿Oh, Salima! ﻿I'd give 2 years of my pathetic life for one night with her. ﻿Your father is like a brother to me. ﻿Everyone knows we share our sorrows and our joy. ﻿Do you know how long I've known your father? ﻿Before he married your mother, ﻿before you were born, ﻿even before he became a tailor. ﻿Your father played the oud. ﻿He would drive the crowd wild. An artist. ﻿Abu Saadun can't wait for him to play in his club, like the old days. ﻿Salima is crazy about him. ﻿He is her world. ﻿May I choke in my sleep if I'm lying. ﻿If it was up to him, he would have married her. ﻿And then, Kabi, you wouldn't have been born ﻿and I wouldn't be sitting with you rambling on like this. ﻿Come, Father. ﻿No. Leave me alone. ﻿Let's go home. ﻿I can walk on my own. ﻿Let go of me. -That's enough! ﻿Salman, take care. -Don't worry. ﻿Be careful on the street. ﻿That's enough. ﻿That's enough, son. ﻿Take those suitcases inside! ﻿They're from Israel. ﻿From Palestine! ﻿Bring them in. ﻿Take them inside. ﻿All the way in. ﻿Salman Amari, son of Farha. ﻿He's here. -Excuse me. ﻿Father, we made a decision. ﻿When do we leave? -Sorry, I don't know. ﻿You'll be told. ﻿70 generations, 70 generations... ﻿From now on you are no longer citizens. ﻿Welcome. -Thank you. ﻿Have a drink and enjoy... ﻿Why aren't you joining them? ﻿I had a dream last night ﻿Hazkel and I get married ﻿and I tell him, ﻿"but we are married!" ﻿And he doesn't answer. ﻿scream an scream and he says nothing. ﻿Until the Muezzin woke me up. ﻿If you believe in dreams, see it as a good sign. ﻿What are they so happy about? ﻿Did you think I would leave you alone? ﻿You should be with us. ﻿Father is happy. ﻿He finally has a reason. ﻿Yes, now he's selling suitcases. ﻿Once he was a lawyer, ﻿then he wanted to marry Salima, then he was an oud player, ﻿then he became a tailor. ﻿Now he's ruining our lives. ﻿That's enough, Rachelle. You're driving me crazy. ﻿No matter what I do for you, you remain stubborn. ﻿No one can help me. ﻿Not even you, my love. ﻿I've been alone my entire life. ﻿It is my destiny. ﻿Father, we only have a few minutes with him. ﻿HazkeL HazkeL ﻿Salman! ﻿What have they done to you? You look like a skeleton. ﻿What a son you have. ﻿If not for Kabi, I would have been dead. ﻿No more excuses now. We must do what we can to get the Jews out of Iraq. ﻿Why did they move you here? ﻿Salman. Swear to me you're taking Rachelle with you. ﻿She mustn't wait for me, I will probably grow old in here. ﻿What have I done to you, brother? What kind of decree is this? ﻿She insists, Uncle. She insists. ﻿Brother, swear on our parents, on our entire family ﻿that you won't leave her here. ﻿What will she do all alone, poor thing, while I rot in here? ﻿Swear to me! ﻿Father? -Salman, please. ﻿Listen up. The decision has been made. ﻿Abu Saleh, do you have the list of families? ﻿Here it is, commander. ﻿Do it quick. ﻿Pass it on to each and every family. ﻿There are no guns left in Basra. We don't need weapons anymore. ﻿You will be the last to leave. ﻿Father, there's only been one plane. What about the rest? ﻿Fuad gave me some more news. ﻿A third party is conducting talks with the Iraqi government ﻿to free all the Jews in return for the Iraqi prisoners ﻿that were captured by the Israelis. ﻿That's why Nuri made his statement. ﻿From now on, no more meetings in my house. ﻿It's time for the next phase. ﻿Be careful. Make sure the coast is clear. ﻿Abu Saleh, hold on. ﻿Our people are stubborn. Th﻿ey have no faith , they have no God. ﻿Abu Saleh, there are new orders. ﻿What? ﻿Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is one. ﻿What a disaster! They destroyed the synagogue... ﻿Wait. I just came from there. A bomb was thrown into the synagogue! ﻿Is anyone dead? No. -Where's your Father? ﻿With Abu Saleh, tending to the wounded. ﻿The wounded? -Yes. ﻿How come you are here? ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿Mother, stop! Everyone's here. ﻿Traitor! Liar! ﻿You snake! You saboteur. You are the head of the snake! ﻿You and your friends! The head of the snake! ﻿Stop it. ﻿He's the cause of all our troubles. It's all his fault. ﻿And you! People are talking about you! ﻿About me? -Yes. ﻿They're talking about me?! -Mother, that's enough. ﻿Forgive me, my child. ﻿Forgive me. Come, my child. ﻿He is the traitor. ﻿How do you know? ﻿I know him like the back of my hand! ﻿He brought me into this world. I know him! ﻿No!!! ﻿No!!! ﻿Hazkel!!! ﻿"I am a Zionist spy" ﻿Allah is great! ﻿Long live the king! ﻿Allah is great! ﻿Long live the king! ﻿Allah is great! ﻿May His great Name grow exalted and sanctified ﻿in the world that He created as He willed. ﻿May He give reign to His kingship in your lifetimes and in your days, ﻿and in the lifetimes of the entire Family of Israel, ﻿swiftly and soon. Now say: Amen. ﻿You are going to our villages and homes in Palestine. ﻿Kabi! ﻿Kabi! ﻿Kabi. Betweeen the years 1950-1951 Left Iraq Close to a hundred and thirty thousand Jews. The most ancient Jewish comunity in the world ceased to exist. ﻿Translation: Tammy King ﻿Subtitles: Cinematyp Studios Ltd.
