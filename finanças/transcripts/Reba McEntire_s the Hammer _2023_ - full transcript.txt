Ah-ah, if you don't mind. Little bit of a nervous nellie, aren't you? Uh, right there in that drawer. -Wayne: Tag's still on it. -Well, I told you I'm new. Governor just appointed me. First time on the bench. I'm replacing that judge who died in the whorehouse. -Judge brewer. -Kris: That's him, And as the new traveling judge, I'm covering three court houses over 25,000 square miles, Which explains why I'm in such a hurry. [wayne sighs] Well, welcome to the territory, your honor. -Kim: Thank you. - Um, just, uh, Do me a favor and slow down. Next time, I will have to write you a ticket. Thanks for the warning, deputy. Now, you do me a favor. You keep that gun in your damn holster. If I ever hear that you pulled your weapon On a traffic stop again, you and I will have a problem. [dramatic lively music] Yes, ma'am. [clears throat] [♪♪] [sighs] [telephone ringing] Oh, this one's a doozy, huh. [sighs] How do? [mae clicks tongue] Which way to the judge's chambers? Brewer or carpenter? I hope not brewer 'cause he's dead. Wheeler, kim. Oh! Sorry, your honor. Down the hall. Upstairs. -Upstairs. Okay, thank you. -Yeah. [indistinct chattering] What? No cameras. Uh, no. -No visitor's sign-in? -Uh, what for? So, we know who's coming and going. Criminals mostly, ain't it? Okie dokie. [indistinct chattering] Ooh. [laughs] [gentle upbeat music] [♪♪] Wow. How do? [laughs] What do you think you're doing? Checking out my new digs. Judge kim wheeler. You must be jo, the court coordinator. -We spoke on the phone. -Sorry judge, I hadn't had a chance to pack things up yet. Oh, no worries. Looks like the former tenant was a man of vice. -No judgment here. -Jo: If you prefer, There's an empty office down the hall. Oh no. I'll be snug as a bug in a rug right here. Your morning cases. I can brief you if you like. -Thanks, I'm good. -Are you sure? There's, there's a lot of material For a first time judge. You'll wanna be prepared. I've done all my own research and review since law school. Only way I know to do the job. This your handy work? Some mighty fine penmanship. Is there anything I can get you for the bench? Water, soda? -Coffee'd be nice. Black. -I'll see what I can do. And my assistant. What's his name? Warren. I'm afraid, um, in light of the changing situation, He's decided to retire. And by changing situation you mean working for a woman? [dramatic lively music] Uh-huh. Yeah. [sighs] lord, you brought me here. Heaven knows it's not my job to question why. Only ask that you give me the strength Not to strangle anybody Or pee my pants in the courtroom, amen. [♪♪] Oh, hi. Your honor, I'm vicky mason, your bailiff. Hi, vicky. -Here's some coffee. -Oh, bless your heart. Thank you. Let's get this show on the road. I'm as nervous as a long-tailed cat In a room full of rocking chairs. [laughs] -Yes, ma'am. -[kim grunts] Oh, no! Crap. Here. Oh gosh. Go get us some towels and stuff. Nobody can slip on this. Ma'am, I gotta call you into court and be here. This is highly irregular. Yeah, well get used to it, okay? Clean that up, would you? All right. Kim: All rise. Fifth district court state of nevada now in session. Honorable judge kim wheeler presiding. That's me. That's the judge. [laughs] Full house, I see. Okay, everybody sit down. First up on the docket is, uh, mr. Langdon marshall. Langdon's lawyer: That's you. Mr. Marshall, I understand you were arrested For public intoxication and indecency, is that correct? Indecency! [laughs] Keep it down or it's back to lockup. [laughs] yeah. Tell me what happened, mr. Marshall. We was hanging out at dusty's. There was a line at the john, So I went outside to do my business. Next thing I know, this cop throws a light on me. I, I turn around and... And everybody saw my junk. [willis laughs] Mr. Marshall, you've been arrested twice, Once for public intoxication, once for public urination, And once for trespassing while trying to steal beer From a neighbor's garage. You got a problem with alcohol? Problem with alcohol? Who doesn't? -Kim: Okay. -Woohoo! Hey, when I'm speaking, you zip it. Otherwise, we're gonna have a problem, mister. Oh, you want a problem, woman? I got a problem with you. -Yes, I do. -Lawyer: Wait, wait, bailiff! You're the problem, yeah! -[blow thuds] -[willis grunts] [people gasps, chatter indistinctly] Freeze! Everybody just chill. [inhaler whistles] [kim sighs] I'm sweating like a whore in church. Of course, that could have something to do With me getting attacked. It's my fault, your honor. I should not have left my post. -Oh, I asked you to. -Vicky: Still. Don't beat yourself up. Clearly, I can take care of myself. Judge, we have a problem. What's that? Tomorrow is the, uh, Hearing for the dirk crawford murder case. Dirk crawford? Ran his best friend off the road for dating his ex. Still doesn't ring a bell. That's because it was left off of your schedule. Technically, my mistake, but the judge's assistant Usually double checks these things. Bottom line, you're due in tonopah tomorrow at 8:00 a.M. Tonopah? Well, that's quite a trek. A hundred-and-sixty-seven miles. We'll leave after work, Stay the night at the mitzvah hotel. The courthouse is right next door. Can't we postpone? It's a motion to dismiss for a lack of a speedy trial, So I don't think that would be prudent. The passing of judge brewer has been difficult on all sides. [gentle melancholy music] [♪♪] [gentle mournful music continues] Mm, that smells good. You will know the lord When he gives you meat in the evening, exodus. Okay, I got venison, sausage, eggs, and buttered sourdough. You know there's 41 carbs in that single slice of bread. Ooh, carb smart. You're gonna need your energy if you travel with me, girl. Here's you a fork. [chuckles] this is quite the rig you got. Well, thank you. Had it custom made. Twin-turbo v8, chipped with a custom camper. Oh yeah? Well, 17 more payments And that little baby is all mine. -Straight six or four banger? -Those are engines, right? [kim laughing] -Hey look, it's the hammer. -Oh, my god. What's that about? -Oh, you don't know? -No. Oh, you have officially gone viral. -[blows thudding] -[willis grunting] Are you smiling? 'cause that's not funny. No, not smiling. Not smiling. Although you have to admit, A hammer's a pretty good nickname for a judge. Hmm. There you go. I unfortunately do not eat meat. It's not meat, it's sausage. Now eat. [bright lively music] [♪♪] [sighs] -Can I ask you a question? -Shoot. You homeless? Why would you ask me that? The, the camper, the sleeping bag, And no disrespect, your honor, But you look like you have not showered. [kim sniffs] I take a bath regularly if that's what you're asking. I can help you find a place if you need. No thanks. I like to sleep where I can see the stars. All right, but you know that judge brewer Received death threats? Yeah. And he died of a heart attack. Clearly, I can take care of myself. This ain't vegas. We don't even have metal detectors, And you met mae. She is hardly a deterrent. But then I have you, don't I? [vicky chuckles] [engine rumbling] Your honor, what should I do If I witness a crime as it's happening? I guess take the action most prudent. All right then. Can you slow the hell down? You are doing well over 100. [laughs] sorry. No, you're not. [laughs] well, would you look at that? Uh, yeah, the tonopah solar farms Owned by the one and only bart crawford. -Any kin of dirk? -Yeah, his dear old daddy. [gentle upbeat music] [♪♪] [birds chirping] You are not sleeping in this truck tonight. Why are you so concerned about where I get my 40 winks? Well, because like how you said, it is kind of my job. [gentle upbeat music] Okay, fine, fine. Fine. But then I'm sleeping in here, too. You got another blanket? -[kim sighs] -[vicky grunts] Well, does the room at least have a window? Oh, a big beautiful window with views of the mountain. You'll love it. Come on. [♪♪] -It's just down the hall. -Thank you. Have a nice day. We are in luck. Our rooms are on the second floor. Oh. Rumor has it the third one's haunted. Oh, my kind of place. What do you say we get a drink later on? -Yeah. -[electricity crackling] Hmm, hope you're okay with ghosts. Oh, dead doesn't bother me. It's the living that gives me the creeps. Vicky: Mm. [gentle upbeat music continues] [hands tapping] Evening, ma'am. What's your poison? -Well, hi there... -Vance. Vance, uh, well, I prefer an old fashioned, But I'll settle on a diet soda. -Coming right up. -Thank you. Customer: Hey, vance, you got my order? Sure do. There's your bottle, buddy. Customer: Thanks. You sell booze to go? I didn't realize that was still being done. Yes, ma'am. Whatever the customer wants. Can I ask what brings you to our neck of the woods. Uh, court. I'm the new judge. The hammer, right? Congratulations. First time in tonopah? No, I grew up around here. How about you? Born and raised. Mm. Married, got any family? Eh, there's a special lady, but it's complicated. Yeah, can relate to that. -Love what you did to the place. -Bart: Thank you. [upbeat lively music] How about a little splash of whiskey In that drink, your honor? Not opposed, but I do like to know who I'm drinking with. I'm the owner of this establishment, -Bart crawford. -Ah-ha. Well, I'm the judge in your son's case, And any conversation outside the courtroom Would be construed as a conflict of interest. Only interest I have is in getting to know you better. Well, well, if you've got something to say, Go ahead and say it 'cause I'm fixing to enjoy my evening. Just wanna say welcome. We residents of tonopah are thrilled to have A legal mind of your caliber on the bench. I hope you don't mind me saying this, But you remind me of that serpent in the bible. -Really? -Uh-huh. Well, historically, the serpent's a symbol Of fertility and renewal of the life force. Not very subtle, are you? -May I? -Help yourself. The governor's a friend of mine. When he mentioned your name to replace judge brewer, I endorsed your wholeheartedly. As a lawyer, no one in this state's done more for victims Of abuse and discrimination than you have. Well, thank you for that. So, you're a friend of the governor, huh? Bart: I am, we, we met in princeton For my two decades in silicon valley. So you're a techie. [chuckles] I bet this place bores you to tears. Well, no. On the contrary, Nevada's a land of untapped potential. I'm very excited about being back. Your honor. Bart. [grunts] you ladies going out on the town tonight? I could arrange a special table. Thanks, but we're good. You two enjoy your evening. Judge wheeler, very nice to meet you. Mr. Crawford. Bart: Victoria. [laughs] I didn't take you for a saloon girl. Hey, I was just sitting here minding my own business. Sure, but if I was you, I'd stay away from bart crawford. He's always reminded me of that snake in the bible. Vance. [gentle upbeat music] [♪♪] [cellphone ringing] Vicky: Mm. Mm. [clears throat] this better be good. Friend: Hey honey, it is. The autopsy just came back on judge brewer. It looks like he was murdered. Yeah. Okay, thanks. [dramatic tense music] [♪♪] Judge wheeler. Judge wheeler! What are you, some kind of new rooster? I thought I saw someone sneaking about. Maybe it's the mitzvah ghost. And you said you'd sleep in a room tonight. I tried, but it was so stuffy. What are you doing down here anyway? Vicky: I just got off the phone with a friend. The autopsy for judge brewer just came back. He was murdered. [dramatic tense music] [gentle upbeat music] -Kim: Good morning. -Vicky: Good morning. -All clean. Wanna check? -I trust you. Okay, so how close is the courthouse? -Eh, I'd say it's pretty close. -Mm-hmm. Judge, I have to say I'm concerned. What about? Well, we just learned that the man That you replaced was killed, And then there was a stranger in white snakeskin boots Creeping around your truck last night. How are you completely unfazed by all this? You're not worried you could be next? Oh, it's just the way I am, calm under the pressure. So, any more information back from your friend? They have a suspect, but that's all he could tell me. Is he a boyfriend? Oh, we went on a date or two. -Is he in law enforcement? -He's a deputy. Any more questions in this interrogation? No, not right now, but I'm sure I'll think of something. [both chuckling] [people chattering indistinctly] You're right. It is close. [chuckles] you ready? Mm-hmm. Vicky: All rise. Fifth district court of the state of nevada Is now in session. The honorable kim wheeler now presiding. Y'all sit down. All right, we've gathered today To hear a motion to dismiss in the case Of the people v. Dirk crawford on the charge of murder. Okay, I've read the brief. Any additional information for me, mr. Goodlander? Your honor, the late judge brewer acted With bias towards mr. Crawford by denying him bail And leaving him incarcerated these past eight months Despite the fact he poses no flight risk. Dirk crawford, the son of bart crawford, The one that owns the large solar farm -Along the highway? -Yes, your honor, But I don't see how that's relevant. Well, he possesses the means to evade judgment. I'm gonna side with judge brewer on this. What else you got? Judge wheeler, the actions of judge brewer Denied my client his right to a speedy trial, And every day that goes by Further prejudices mr. Crawford's case. -In what way? -My client's defense hinges On the testimony of eyewitnesses. Their ability to recall the events in question Could be negatively affected by the passage of time. You're afraid that a bunch of small-town teenagers Won't remember the night That one of their own was killed? -Your honor, may I approach? -Yeah, come on up. You better start acting remorseful, son, And I mean right now. With all due respect, judge, You may not be aware of the depth Of animosity that exists between the late judge brewer And the senior mr. Crawford. Your honor, this is all clearly a calculated attempt To introduce the idea that the witnesses scheduled To testify can't be trusted To remember events as they occurred. Mr. Goodlander, I may be new, but I wasn't born yesterday. -Motion denied. -[gavel thuds] -Ellis: Told you. -Kim: Okay. In the interest of a speedy trial, We can begin jury selection immediately. -Who does the calendar here? -Your assistant. Crap. I was afraid of that. All righty then. Looks like I'm free Monday. Monday good with everyone? -Yes, ma'am. -Yes. Okay, see you boys then. Court adjourned. All rise. [upbeat lively music] Thank you. Council. -See you later. -Ellis: Thank you. Oh, pretty. Oh, I was meaning to ask you, the young man who died, Was any of his family in the courtroom today? No. He only has an uncle that lives in a va home. Wow, well how about the blond That was sitting by bart crawford? Oh, that's charlene, his ex, dirk's mom. What's her story? Probably exactly what you think. Ex-beauty queen who's used To getting everything that she wants. Rumor is she broke a lot of hearts around here Trying to make bart jealous, but he still divorced her. Well, why was she giving me the evil eye? Probably 'cause she thought you'd dismiss her son's case. Hmm, you know anything about the beef Between bart crawford and judge brewer? No details, just that he threatened To kill the judge in front of witnesses. You think he could be a killer? It's not the first time a parent killed -To protect a child. -[notification dings] Kim: Excuse me. Mm, judge carpenter wants me to stop by And have a little chat when we get back. Oh, lucky you. Kim: Great. Thanks for the warning. [bright upbeat music] Your honor, I'm kim wheeler. Oh, hello, kim, call me hank. Have a seat. Thank you, sir. You like moose? Owner flew it in fresh from alaska. Oh, thank you, no. I've already eaten. You know, I must admit You are not what I was expecting. No, I was picturing some highfalutin type With a designer suit And a face full of plastic surgery. [both chuckling] Well, I consider myself low maintenance. -Is that a fact? -Yes, sir. Well, first off, let me welcome you to the territory. -Oh, thank you. Thank you. -Seemed like you had An eventful first few days, huh? Oh, nothing I couldn't handle. Eh, your quick reflex is to be commended. No doubt that boy never knew what hit him. Well, that was a regrettable sit-- And now they call you the hammer. -Mm-hmm. -What is that? That's a-- that's a catchy nickname. Again, regrettable, hank, but to change the subject, I'm sure you're aware That the courthouse needs some serious security upgrades. I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for change around here. -No? -Mm-mm. I've been a judge in this district For over 20 years. Now, rural nevada is a tough country. People like to think it's the old west, You know, old fashioned values. Eh, to be a judge in this district takes grit. What happened to jacob brewer is, uh, proof of that. What exactly you trying to say, hank? Well, what I'm trying to say is that, uh... [chuckles] ...This is no place for a woman, kim. I mean, life here isn't like life in the big city. You can't walk 10 feet without running into something That wants to eat you or bite you Or stick you or sting you. -I was born and raised here. -No, the truth is... I think the governor made a mistake hiring you. That's plain and simple. I mean it's nothing personal, But, uh, I'm just not sure that a woman, But, or any woman has what it takes To do the job the way it should be-- In all do respect, your honor, I disagree with you. You know, there's no shame In reconsidering your appointment. No one will blame you. You're a topnotch lawyer, kim. Surely there must be other, More lucrative avenues you'd like to explore. Again, with all due respect, I think you're underestimating me. So, if there's nothing else you need to discuss with me, I'll let you get on with your dinner. Well, in that case, there is one more thing. Yes, sir. Are you aware of the drug court program? 12-step program? Absolutely. There's no telling how many chemically-dependent, Non-violent criminals That it's helped get back on their feet. Well, I'm turning it over to you. Really? I mean, that's work best suited for a woman anyway. I mean, you know, a lot of hand holding and scolding. Better suited for you girls in tonopah. Now, I'm having my secretary send over The case documents with jo. First session's this afternoon. Hmm. Now, I'm sure you girls will do a bang-up job. Good luck. -Thank you, sir. -Sure you won't have something? I'm good. Thank you. [gentle calm music] Vicky: All rise. Fifth district court of the state of nevada Is now in session. The honorable kim wheeler now presiding. Congratulations on receiving your ged, ms. Allen. I think that deserves a round of applause. [all clapping] And for coming to us clean today, Which our drug court supervisor can confirm. -Yes, your honor. -Thank you. And before you go, stop by And see ms. Greg in the court office. She has a list of some trustworthy sitters That can watch your child while you're at work. Okay, next up, angel brown. How do, ms. Brown? I see you've completed step 12 of the program. Yes, your honor. And you come to us clean today. Yes. Ms. Brown, I'm sure you've heard the saying, The truth will set you free. Well, one thing you'll learn about me, I can't tolerate a liar. I'm, I'm not lying. Mr. Stevenson? Your honor, her most recent tests showed Ms. Brown had over 1,200 nanograms per milliliter In her blood, Indicating she had used methamphetamines At least once in the preceding three days. No. No, he's wrong. I'm clean, your honor. I'm not using. Ms. Brown, we all make mistakes, And if you're smart, you'll learn from yours. Now, I'm gonna give you a couple of days In jail to ponder your actions. [gavel thuds] This is a joke. You're, you're a joke! Watch your tone, young lady. Why? 'cause you're the hammer? You gonna hit me? Go ahead and hit me. Hammer way! I don't care, I don't care. -Vicky: Come on, let's go. -[gavel thudding] Angel: I am clean! [gentle suspenseful music] What do you know about angel brown? Not much. She used to party pretty hard. Judge brewer sentenced her to drug court late last year. Yeah, records show That she tested clean nine months straight. [indistinct chatter] Any chance things could have gone wrong on this test? I doubt it. Urine collection is supervised And then the test is picked up by the local lab. And you've never heard of anything going wrong before? Nope. Although there was one girl, eileen price, She tested positive, But it just turned out the wrong name Was on the sample. -Where is she now? -She works down at klassy kat. [people chattering indistinctly] [gentle suspenseful music] [♪♪] [tense suspenseful music] [gentle suspenseful music] [♪♪] Preacher: Now, if you're like me, You've spent most of your adult life being angry About something that happened in your childhood, Parent that let you down, sibling who hurt you. Well, I'm here to tell you it's time to let that anger go. Forgive and you shall be forgiven. [gentle peaceful music] [♪♪] [kim sighs] [wind chimes tinkling] Go to hell! We don't want any. Kim: Dad, dad. It's me, kim. Well, well, well. Looks like hell finally did freeze over. Hello there, sister. [tense suspenseful music] [♪♪] [gentle upbeat music] Here you go. -Thank you, ma'am. -Yep. How's daddy? [chuckles] old, mad, loves to yell. So, just like the good old days. [kim chuckles] You even care? Sometimes I do. Kris: He's got good days and bad. Try to stop by and check in on him anytime I can. Where you staying? In my truck. Well, you're welcome to stay here... Or set up camp at the lady. Kim: You know they say judge brewer was murdered. Kris: What? Why? Kim: We don't know anything more. Virgil: Are we going to eat? Swanson's in the oven. Keep your shirt on, old man. I'm just joking. I air fried some chicken. -[chuckles] -come on, we got plenty. Thanks. [gentle calm music] Kris: Don't you dare let that cat at the table, daddy. You want cream or sugar? -No, I take mine black, thanks. -[grunts] Me too. You know, it's just crazy to think That my sister is the big bad judge in town. Yeah, a lot of people would agree with you on that. You know, I never figured you'd come back here After everything that happened. Part of my path, I guess. Well, no need to worry about him anymore. These days, he just watches tv all day with daisy. -Who's daisy? -That mangy cat. She wandered in one day, Took one look at dad and the two of them, They've been inseparable ever since. I think he finally found his soulmate. And this one's declawed. [both laughs] So, he's out here by himself, not even a housekeeper? Mm. Kim, he can barely afford the pain meds. Besides, he gets all paranoid around strangers. They say it's the dementia. I'm sorry, I didn't know you were dealing with all this. Well, I thought about just letting him die alone, But that didn't seem real christian-like. [both laughs] [coughs] But seriously, kim... If you came back here to try to-- No, no. Just came by to say hi, kris, I promise. Good. Let's just let the past be the past. I'll drink to that. [mugs clinking] Speaking of. [laughs] Think you ought to go a little slower on that? Please, kim. I think I know my limits. Okie dokie. Kris: It's almost empty. [gentle calm music] Mm. [♪♪] [cellphone vibrating] [gentle suspenseful music] Hello. [caller breathing heavily] Hello? Caller: This is your first, last, and only warning, judge wheeler. Who is this? Caller: There's no place you can go that I won't know. You, your passed-out sister, And your sleeping daddy are no longer safe. [kim gasping] Caller: Unless you want to end up like brewer, I suggest you do the smart thing... And head back to vegas. [caller breathing heavily] [phone signal beeping] Kim: Hello? Hello? [wind chimes tinkling] [heartbeat thumping] Show yourself! I know you're out there. [tense suspenseful music] [♪♪] Damn. Kris, wake up. Where's mama's gun? Okay, look, kimmie, I don't think that I buried it. Now, I know that I buried daddy's car keys And his shotgun shells in the backyard, but oh god. Oh, my gosh. [gasps] -Kris: Kim! -What? Kris: Get over here. What? Oh, my gosh. Do you know what year this is? Look at how beautiful mama looks in this picture. Kris, please focus. Okay, well, it's not my fault I was over-served. You know you should wear your hair like this again. I'm telling you, it's much more approachable. [gentle melancholy music] Oh. [gentle suspenseful music] [♪♪] Virgil: If you don't wanna be put up the attic again, You're gonna have to follow my rules Or I'm gonna give you the belt. Young kim: I'm sorry, daddy. Please don't hurt me. I'm sorry. [echoes] [gasps] kimmie, there she is. There we go. Mama's gun. [exhales] do you mind? It's all yours. Can't be too careful around here. [tense suspenseful music] [♪♪] How do you like your coffee, judge? Percolated over a camp fire thick as molasses. Black or cream and sugar? -Black, please. Thank you. -You bet. -Have a seat. -Thank you. You're a bit far from home, aren't you? Oh, I do business in pahrump so I can keep a place here. Is that so? So, what can I do you for? Well, I'm guessing you heard judge brewer And I didn't get along. Well, I've heard you threatened to kill him, -If that's what you mean. -Well, that's why I'm here. While the facts are true, context is missing. Right. Okay, so contextualize away. Well, the judge and I had an adversarial relationship. He was strongly opposed to my, uh, solar farm, Which he claimed was bad for biodiversity. When I prevailed in court... He was livid. And then your son got arrested, and he was assigned to the case. He refused to consider a plea, And when he locked up dirk without bail, We got into a, uh... Heated argument. -So, you have a temper? -Bart: I do. But, uh, I've worked hard at controlling it. My son, unfortunately, has the same issue. So, why are you telling me all of this? Well, a couple of reasons. I know my son comes off as an entitled teenager, But that's just an act. Truth is he's scared to death. His best friend's dead, And he hasn't come to terms with it. But he will, I promise. -And the second reason? -I didn't want you, uh, Going around thinking I might be a murderer. So what? I'm supposed to take your word for that. No, no. The hotel's got a network of security cameras. Footage will show that I worked long past midnight that night. Oh, excuse me. [tense suspenseful music] No, I was just leaving. Judge, thank you for your time. -Thank you for the coffee. -You bet. You have a good day, little lady. Kim: Jo, do me a favor, would you? Call the clerk over at judge toroshi's office In carson city, his name's malcolm. Tell him I need access to a sealed juvenile record. Whose record? Leo stevenson? I don't have to tell you to keep this confidential. -Of course not. -Okay. What was bart crawford doing here? He brought me coffee. I would watch out for him if I were you. [gentle upbeat music] Why's everybody keep saying that? [door alarm buzzes] -[doors creaking] -[keys jingling] Great. You here to hammer me again? [indistinct chattering in distance] I need you to tell me about leo stevenson. -What about him? -The truth. You be honest with me And I promise I'll do everything I can to help you. -Leo's like a real creep. -How exactly? He, like, stands in the bathroom when I give my sample. -He watches you urinate? -Yeah. Is anybody else present? No, but he does it to all the girls. He says it's to make sure our pee's legit. [tense suspenseful music] Has he ever touched you? No, but he's always saying How we should, like, go out sometime. Have you ever gone out with him? Ew! Gross. I just, like, laugh it off, pretend he's joking. -Has he ever threatened you? -No. He, he just says things like, if I wanna test clean, -I gotta be nice to him. -Oh honey, that is a threat. Why haven't you told anybody about this? Uh... I didn't think anyone would believe me. I do. [gentle calm music] Kim: Being with that girl today At the jail reminded me of me when I was her age. Back then, all I wanted to do Is have this town in my rear view mirror. Kris: It's all right. And I guess that's what I did. Kris, I'm sorry I ran out on you last time. Least I could have done was to leave a note. You hated it here. No, I hated the situation. I didn't hate the location. Maybe so, but... I left you alone with him. I shouldn't have done that. It's my fault you left. I don't know what I was thinking. Yeah, I was really mad at that. But I'm not mad anymore. All gone. Kris: Well, hallelujah to that. [both laughs] Uh, why? -Kim: Who's this. -Kris: Wait'll you meet him. This is the boy wonder detective. This oughta be fun. What now, wayne? Some schoolmarm missing a husband? -How do, deputy? -Judge. Oh, wayne, you know my sister? We've, uh, met, and, uh, I'm sorry about this, kris. [sighs] I'm just following orders. Kris wheeler, you are under arrest For the murder of judge jacob brewer. Okay, come on, wa-- you gotta be kidding me. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to consult an attorney. -Let me see that. -Yes, ma'am. It's all there. [tense suspenseful music] Sorry, kris. It's legit. Okay, all right, this is ridiculous. I didn't do it. Kimmie. Kimmie, you gotta believe me. -Don't talk to anyone. -Okay, I got it. I'll come see you as soon as I can. [♪♪] [gentle upbeat music] Double burger. Big pie. Hmm, nah, I'll just get a burrito. -[buttons beeping] -[burrito thuds] Well, if it isn't the unsolicited solicitor. Easy, your honor. I am just a cog in the wheel of justice. Oh, save me the crappy metaphors, ellis. You haul my sister off to jail And you don't even bother to call me? Sorry, we had to move fast. You even got a case, ellis? Perhaps you could stop by my office later -To discuss the matter. -Oh, no. We're gonna talk about it right now. -[clears throat] -[inhaler whistles] Okay, as you know, Judge brewer died of heart attack, But there was tissue damage suggesting drug abuse, So a toxicology report was ordered. Now the report found a massive amount Of oxycontin in his system. And that ties to my sister how? Well, she was the last one to see him alive, And oxy was found in her possession During a recent investigation, So we believe ms. Wheeler provided the drugs -That led to the judge's demise. -Drugs. You mean there was more than one? Rohypnol was also found in the blood. Well, that doesn't make any sense. Who parties on a date rape drug? Who knows why people do anything? I want a copy of that m.E. Report. Your honor, you have to get discovery through council. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to nourish myself and I must get back to work. [gentle upbeat music] What time can I see her? What time's the arraignment? Okay, thank you. -[button beeps] -bad news? My sister's getting prepped for her arraignment. I can't see her till tomorrow. Oh, well, I thought you would wanna know I heard from malcolm in carson city. And? He said he can't divulge the contents Of leo stevenson's sealed records, But he suggested I look into the registry Of spring hill in 2008. It sounded like leo was a patient there. -You know spring hill? -I do. It's a treatment center for male sex offenders. [tense suspenseful music] Mm-hmm. Were you aware that leo stevenson Was in the bathroom watching the girls give their samples, Then threatening to fail them if they don't go out with him? No, I was not. Are you telling me there's no oversight In this drug testing program here? Hey, I've only been on drug court a couple of days, Same as you. And you really think I'd cover for that little weasel? No, of course not. Okay. So, what about leo? Can we have him arrested? Not unless someone comes forward with some real evidence. There is one person, but she doesn't wanna talk. Yeah, look, I know these girls. They're alone and afraid and all they want Is to know that somebody has their back. [chuckles] yeah, I know how they feel. [upbeat lively music] [man whistles] Eileen, there's a man out there preying on vulnerable women. Vicky: And you can stop him by just telling your story. You can take away his power, eileen. You do this and I promise others will follow your lead. Ellen: Then ask one of them. Look, I know we're asking you to do a very hard thing. Let me just give you a little personal experience. If you stay quiet and bury this deep down inside And just go on with your life, you'll never escape it. Take this opportunity and confront him. If you don't, that opportunity will go away And all you'll be left with is a whole lot of hurt. [gentle poignant music] [♪♪] -Hey. -[sighs] Kim: I brought you a dress to wear. Why? Shows you respect the court. [laughs] okay, respect? Okay, all right, I spent the last 40 years being resented, Harassed, condemned. They wanna lock me up, okay? And this is their chance. I'm here to help you. I can't go back to jail, kimmie, okay? I just, I can't. And you won't. You won't have to. -Okay? -Okay. Just as soon as the judge grants bail, -You're on your way home. -Mm-hmm. -I just need you to focus. -Mm-hmm. Let's start out with you telling me everything you know About the night that judge brewer died. Okay, um, well he, uh, He showed up around nine, you know, usual time. -So, he was a regular. -Oh, yeah. He shoulda had a punch card. Whenever he had court in tonopah, He'd tell his wife he was staying at the mitzvah. He'd make a big show about having a few drinks at the bar, And then he'd drive down to the lady and spend the night. Mm-hmm. So, what happened when he showed up? Oh, he must have been drunk. Sadie went in to wake him up, but he was passed out. And he was dead the next morning. Yeah. You ever give him any drugs? Kim, we don't provide drugs at the lady. We're ladies. If a guest brings their own, that's on them. Okay, so where did the oxy come from that the cops found? Dad's prescription. -Oh. -For his dementia. I keep the bottle in my bag so he doesn't accidentally od. Did judge brewer's wife ever know That he was catting around down at the shady lady? Uh, no. Woman's holier than thou. Judge told me once if she knew What he was doing, she'd kill him. -Hmm. -[dramatic suspenseful music] [tense suspenseful music] -[fire crackling] -kim: Dad, what... Good lord, what have you... [lid smacking] -Oh, sh-- -are we gonna eat? Are you okay? -Are we gonna eat? -[coughs] Not that. Come here. Turn around, dad. Sit down. Oh, I'll make you a sandwich, okay? Sit right here. I'll get you some water. -Beer. -What? Get me a beer. -Dad, you need water. -I want a damn beer! [dramatic tense music] Okay, I'll get you a beer. Virgil: Where's kris? Kris is not here right now. It's me, kimmie. Kim? -Damn it. -Here. Here you go, dad. Don't touch me. No, don't touch me! [♪♪] Virgil: Where's kris? Kris is, uh, gonna be gone for a day or two. I always liked kris better. Yeah, I always felt that. Get me a beer! [♪♪] Can't do this. Can't do it. [gentle calm music] Thank you for coming by on such short notice. Come on in. [door squeaks] [♪♪] Mr. Lipkin, you owe $10,000 in unpaid child support. Now, I could throw you in jail for six months. Problem is if you're in jail, you don't work. You're not even working when you're not in jail. See my dilemma? So, here's what we're gonna do. I'm sentencing you to six months probation, And in which time you're gonna work Eight hours a day, five days a week Cleaning your ex-wife's house. [people laughing] You'll do the yard work, laundry, Fix your children's lunches, help them with their homework, And any other damn thing She wants you to do, you understand? And if in six months, you hadn't found steady work, I'm gonna sentence you to another six months. See how this works? Do better, mr. Lipkin. -[gavel thuds] -next case. What's going on? Why am I here? You're about to find out. Why don't you have a seat, mr. Stevenson. [tense suspenseful music] Thanks for being here. This is a special hearing for the fifth district drug court. A witness has come forward to give testimony Regarding ms. Brown's recent failed drug test, And because of her courage, other women have come forward. Eileen price, do you swear to tell the truth, The whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you god? I do. How do, ms. Price? You're a recent graduate of the drug court, aren't you? -Yes, your honor. -Kim: All right, Well, it says here on October the fifth, You tested positive for methamphetamine. A week later, mr. Stevenson, the drug court supervisor Admitted your name was mistakenly placed On someone else's sample. You were retested and allowed to graduate, -Correct? -Yes, ma'am. All right, ms. Price, in your own words, Please tell the court The circumstances surrounding that incident. [eileen exhales] Leo told me if I didn't go out with him, I'd regret it. I told him that I wasn't dating, That celibacy was part of my recovery, But he wouldn't stop hounding me, And then suddenly, I tested positive even though I, I haven't been taking anything, I swear. Your honor... [clears throat] your honor, uh, she's lying. Zip it. Please continue. Take your time. Leo told me that that's what I get for being uptight. He said that if I had sex with him, He'd make it all go away. And did you have sex with him? Yes. [people chattering indistinctly] And that's when mr. Stevenson admitted He had made a mistake on your drug test? Yes. Thank you, ms. Price. You may be excused. [gentle calm music] So mr. Stevenson, what do you have to say for yourself? Your honor, this is ridiculous. They're all drug addicts and liars, That, that they have no proof. Then why do I have sworn affidavits From five different women stating that you threatened jail Unless they had sex with you? Bailiff mason, arrest this man On charges coercion and sexual assault. Gladly. Your honor, uh, let's talk this out. [people applauds] This isn't a fair, a fair trial. I need a lawyer. [gentle upbeat music] Ms. Brown, please stand. Ms. Brown, I'm gonna throw out your last drug test. You'll submit a new test overseen by bailiff mason. If the results are negative, You'll retain your position in drug court. Thank you, your honor. I'm just sorry I didn't believe you In the first place. -Court adjourned. -[gavel thuds] [people applauds] Miss price, can I see you in my chambers? [camera shutter clicking] You wanted to see me, your honor? Yes I did, young lady. Come right on in. What you did out there took guts. I'm really proud of you. From what I can tell, you're tough, smart, Hardworking, and well organized. How'd you like to come work for me? I need an assistant. Uh, um... Course, you'd have to quit the classy cat. Pay's decent. But the best part of all is you'd be able to have dinner With your daughter every night. I... I don't know what to say. Say yes. -Yes. -[laughs] Thank you, your honor. Call me kim, and your office will be Right around the corner there. First order of business, I'd like for you To call judge brewer's wife and ask her to come by And pick up some of her husband's things. Yes, your honor. Kim. There you go. [laughing] -This came for you. -Who from? Jo: There's no return address. Oh, well let's see. -[kim gasps] -jo: Lord! [gasping] That's daisy. -You know this cat? -Kim: Yes, I do. Home is where the heart is. Dad. Oh, my god, dad. [phone ringing] What's the matter? -The nurse is not picking up. -[jo gasping] -[gentle suspenseful music] -[birds chirping] [♪♪] Daddy! Virgil: Daisy, here, daisy. [kim sighs] We can't find daisy. [gentle melancholy music] Wait, someone killed your dad's cat? That's serious. Yeah, I think they were trying to scare me, -Throw me off my game. -Yeah, but for what reason? Well, maybe they don't want me to find out Who really killed judge brewer. Okay, and if you're wrong, I mean, you're putting your family at risk. Okay, I was hoping that you would talk to your friend At the sheriff's department and ask him If he wouldn't mind keeping an eye on my daddy's ranch. Of course. I don't want word getting back to kris. She's got enough to worry about. Vicky: Judge brewer's wife's been waiting. Right, I'll go talk with her. Is that his junk? Yeah. [indistinct chatter] -Wish me luck. -You're gonna need it. Thanks. -Ms. Brewer? -Yes. I'm kim wheeler, the new judge. Oh. I understand your husband was a kind man, well-liked. [scoffs] for some. These his things? Yes, forgive me for being indelicate, ms. Brewer, But were you aware that your husband Liked to visit the shady lady? With your tramp sister? I know kris didn't lead a sacred life, But she's no killer, ms. Brewer. There's no telling what a piece of trash Like that is capable of. I know my sister and she swears She did not give your husband any drugs. Oh, she would do anything to destroy our love -And ruin our marriage. -What makes you say that? Two years ago, I found out jacob was having an affair. He confessed and was granted forgiveness By the good lord and myself. Two weeks ago, I found this letter in his jacket pocket. An unsigned love letter? From your sister begging him to return, And when he didn't, she killed him, mm-hmm. And there's the proof. Have you shown this to the sheriff? I, I meant to, uh... Some reason I just couldn't part with it. Maybe because both of us know my sister didn't write this. I'll make sure the sheriff gets it. I'm sorry for your loss. Thanks for coming by. [tense suspenseful music] How did you know it was me? Your handwriting. I'd recognize that fancy script anywhere. I wrote that letter after jacob and I broke up. -How long were you two together? -Two years. But I was in love with him for a decade before that. And his wife never knew it was you? Jacob protected me Even after dottie asked him to break it off. Did you two ever engage in any kind of games, -Use drugs, rohypnol? -No, never. What'd you do when you found out That he was going to the shady lady? I didn't know. Not until after he died. Okay, let me get this straight. He strung you along, then dumped you And went back to his wife, And you begged for another chance, Yet he would rather hang out at a brothel? You must have been madder than all get out. Try heartbroken. I loved jake, and I didn't kill him. Then who did? [sobs] a lot of people didn't like jacob. He got threats just like you. Most of them were anonymous and he never reported them. He always said if someone didn't want you dead, Then you weren't doing your job. So, do you think he was killed because of one of his cases? I honestly don't know. Please believe me, judge. [gentle suspenseful music] Kris: Do you think this love letter will help clear me? Well, it's enough to bring up reasonable doubt at trial, But I doubt the da'll drop the charges. Glad you're both here. Discovery came through. -Did you get the autopsy report? -Mm-hmm. Forensic shows judge brewer died from an overdose of oxycontin. Administered intravenously under the hallux nail. -The what? -The big toenail. That's where they can hide the injection mark. You mean like a junkie? That explains the rohypnol. Judge brewer's a big old boy. For the killer to inject him, He'd have to incapacitate him first. Meaning whoever did this Likely has experience with iv drugs. -Kim: Mm-hmm. -Which I definitely do not. [notification dings] Crap. I gotta be somewhere. -Check you later, thanks. -Kris: Yeah. Melba: This is looking good. [gentle upbeat music] Kim: So, you two make a deal? [clears throat] that's correct, your honor. -Okay, thank you so much. -Welcome. So, your client agrees to these terms mr. Goodlander? Yes, judge. The terms are more than fair. Okie dokie. I'll set sentencing tomorrow 1:00 p.M. In tonopah. -Thank you. -Thank you, judge. -Ellis, you got a second? -Uh, sure. -[inhaler whistles] -[clears throat] So, according to forensics, The drug that killed judge brewer Was injected under the toenail. So? So, clearly the killer was trying to hide it, Make it look like a heart attack. So, we're looking for someone with iv drug experience. It's a theory, but like most theories, It's long in imagination, short in evidence. [laughs] It wasn't an accidental overdose, counselor. It was premeditated. You can't just ignore that. Are you trying to bully me, judge wheeler? No, I'm trying to make you do your job, mr. Dinkins. You have any idea why goodlander Was so anxious to settle the crawford case? Why? Because he's worried you're a loose cannon Running around in everyone's business. He doesn't trust his case with you on the bench. That's a bunch of bull. He has a weak defense and he knows it. That may be, But I'm gonna tell you something for free. I'd be careful ruffling too many feathers. Is that a threat, ellis? 'cause that sounds like a threat to me. It's just a friendly warning, judge. [dramatic tense music] Folksy as hell, but still a threat. [gentle suspenseful music] Kim: Hey, I need you to go through the drug court records, Compile me a list of all the iv drug users And then crosscheck that list To see if any of them are still living in the area. How far do you want me to go back? As far as you can. I know it's gonna take a while. -Don't worry. I'm on it. -Awesome possum. [phone beeps] So, you really think brewer's killer Came through drug court? Well, it's a lead we definitely need to check out. If dinkins won't do it, that leaves us. Mm-hmm. Would you say I'm a loose cannon? No, no, no. At least not to your face. [laughs] Okay, fair enough. [gentle upbeat music] [♪♪] Kim: All righty then, mr. Crawford, would you please stand? Dirk crawford, you are hereby sentenced to two years In the southern desert correctional center In indian springs with credit for time served. Eligibility for parole will be at the discretion Of the parole board, And I'm suspending your driver's license For one year pending your release. Thank you, your honor. Keep your shirt on, mr. Goodlander. I'm not finished. Mr. Crawford, it's clear to me that you have issues with anger, So I hereby order to you to complete 52 hours Of anger management classes at your own expense, And prior to release, you will appear before me To explain what you've learned And why something like this will never, ever happen again. We'll all make mistakes, mr. Crawford, But yours cost a young man his life, Someone who by all accounts was a close friend, Someone who apparently will never get to enjoy The opportunities that you so easily disdain. That young man will never have the chance To fulfill his promise, But you can honor him by not wasting yours. Do your time, mr. Crawford. Make amends. And the next time we meet, Impress me with your resolve to become a better person. Because trust this, you won't like me disappointed. Any objections? -No, your honor. -Goodlander: No, your honor. -We're done here. -[gavel thuds] Vicky: All rise. [gentle contemplative music] Dirk, this is not gonna happen, okay, honey? Just... What the hell? You were supposed to take care of this. What the hell is going on? -Be strong. -What we're gonna do-- [charlene sighs] [♪♪] [sighs] Vance, I'm in need of your expertise. -Old fashioned? -You got it. [sighs] I guess you're feeling pretty smug. Excuse me? Now, you like sitting up there all high and mighty Passing judgment on people, don't you? Okay, there's a big difference between passing sentence And passing judgment. My son is going to prison, but you insist in piling On the embarrassment by ordering him to therapy? I'm just trying to give dirk the tools he needs To make him a productive member of society. You are pathetic. -Okay. Lady, you need back off. -Or what? You'll have me arrested for speaking my mind? I'm not touching you. -I have my rights-- -easy now, charlene. Don't touch me, vance. You're gonna regret this. Wow, she's a peach. A peach? [laughs] For her, that's a great compliment. Cancel that order. Make mine a double. Make two of those, partner. Well, how about I buy you dinner? Case is over. No conflict of interest. You do realize that I just sent your son To prison, right? And thanks to you, dirk finally broke down And admitted what he did. Says he wants to make up for all of his mistakes. Well, I hope that's true. What you said to him really hit home and I appreciate it. So, can I buy you dinner to say thanks? Well, if you can find a place Where I won't be accosted by my constituents. Well, I know just the place. Make those drinks to go, vance. [upbeat lively music] That was delicious. Great idea. I still can't get over you moving back here. Well, it's certainly an acquired taste. Hmm. Well, how about you? Why'd you leave? Well, when mama passed, my daddy and sister Started fighting like cats and dogs, And then kris, she left home and... Daddy started taking his frustrations out on me. -He was abusive. -Well, emotionally, yeah. Then I left. I ran off to vegas and got a job at a casino To pay my way through college. -Wow, and now you're back. -Yep. -Lucky for us. -Oh, cheers. [glasses clinking] Mm, how about I freshen that drink? -That'd be nice. -[bart grunts] Uh-oh, we are outta bourbon. -Kim: Whoops. -I'll be right back. -I'm going to the barn. -Kim: Okay. [upbeat lively music] [♪♪] Kim: [gasps] white snakeskin boots? [gasps] [tense suspenseful music] [dramatic tense music] [water splashing] Kim: How do, vance? Howdy, judge. A little early, ain't it? -Oh, a little bit. -What can I get you? How about a diet soda, please? Thanks. Oh, and thanks for helping me out yesterday. Ms. Crawford's been going through a tough time lately. I hope you didn't take what she said personal. Seriously? How can you defend her the way -She was treating you? -Vance: Well... Okay, nevermind. Water under the bridge, right? But I do need to ask a favor. I need to look at the hotel security footage From the night that judge brewer died. -Can I ask why? -Well, don't know for sure, But I think it could be something Really important on it. Well, we only keep a week -On the server. -Kim: Mm-hmm. -Old stuff gets archived. -Yeah. And we just moved our records to an old barn outside of town. I suppose I could run you up there -If it's that important. -It is, it really is. Thanks a bunch. Then I'll make that soda to go. Thanks, vance. [cellphone ringing] Hey, eileen. You're up early. I just emailed the judge a list of iv drug users Who went through the program. Wanted to make sure she got it, but she didn't answer her phone. Vicky: I think she's gone off somewhere. Her truck ain't here, but I can give it to her. Okay, by the way, the only one I could find Still in the area was a man named vance, vance white. It wasn't bart. -Okay, thanks eileen. -[phone beeps] [phone ringing] Oh, come on, pick up. Judge, pick up. Operator: Your call has been forwarded-- Damn! [phone ringing] Hey, it's me again. I need you to do something for me. [gentle suspenseful music] -How much farther? -Oh, not far now. Kind of out of the way, isn't it? [exhales] You all right? Yeah, yeah. [clears throat] Come on. Tell me what you're looking for In this video. Well, I'm not sure exactly. But you think the killer could be on there. Well, now that you mention it, uh, Whoever killed judge brewer drugged him first, And he, uh, always had a few drinks At the mitzvah bar Before he headed on down to the shady lady. [laughs] give, give me, give me one to go. -Fill her up-- -sure thing. And fill her up this time, okay? Yeah, that's better, yeah. [tense suspenseful music] So, you drugged my soda with rohypnol Just like you drugged his flask. [gun cocks] Just relax. Just relax. Drugs take a little while to kick in. Take the next left. I think judge wheeler's in trouble. Hold on. I think vance killed judge brewer. -What? -And I'm pretty sure him And kim just drove off to god knows where. -In what car? -Her truck. It ain't here. I think I can find him. Come on. So, after you drugged the judge, You followed him on down to the shady lady -And injected him. -Keep driving. So, those were your taillights at my daddy's ranch. Broke into my truck, killed my daddy's cat, Trying to scare me off, maybe force a mistrial. But why kill judge brewer? -Did bart pay you off? -Are you kidding? Bart doesn't even have the balls to protect his own family. Wait, this is about charlene. Oh, that's why you intervened yesterday And was taking up for her being so protective and so strong. You're in love with her. She's an amazing woman. You guys having an affair? No. That's none of your business. So, she's the one that wanted judge brewer dead. Her son was being railroaded by a corrupted system. Those your words or hers? Vance, charlene's the type of woman Who knows how to get what she wants. She was just using you to do her dirty work. Oh no, no, it's not like that, all right? We're in love, we're, we're gonna be together. See, that's why she wanted To keep y'all's relationship a secret. Five miles south on 95. Go east about a mile or two, okay? And hurry. Don't you worry, vicky. Wayne's on the way. Vance, it's not too late. If you confess and agree to testifying -Against charlene-- -whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Because coercion is against the law, And if you say charlene coerced you Into killing judge brewer, Then I can get them to lessen the sentence. Maybe. Or I could bury you in the desert And get on with my life. [siren wailing] Kim: Two dead judges in two months, vance. -That don't look good for you. -Shut up! Just pull up to the old barn. -Stop the vehicle. -[engine roaring] Stop! Slow down! Stop the truck! Stop, are you-- stop! -[truck crashes] -[vance grunts] [tense suspenseful music] [breathing heavily] [vance grunting] [♪♪] [kim panting] [breathing heavily] Well, this doesn't look good. [siren wailing] Vance: Hey! Hey! Judge wheeler! Kim! Vance: Stop this nonsense! [both grunts] [thunder claps] -[gun cocks] -[gun bangs] -[vance grunting] -[gun bangs] [groans] -[siren wailing] -[grunts] Vicky: Judge! Kim: Over here! [grunts] Quit your moaning or I'll give you something I moan about. Clean shot through and through. He'll be okay. Not my first rodeo. Here, come here and take this. Vicky: Just breathe, wayne. Wayne your friend? Uh... Kim: Deputy, never thought I'd say this, But damn glad to see you. I'll, uh, call an ambulance. I'd feed him to the pigs. Yeah, can we get a paramedic team down here Right quick as you can? Came back with bourbon and you were gone. Oh, sorry about that. How'd you find me? I put a gps tracker on your bumper. Well that explains what you was doing In the parking lot the other night. Well, I was worried whoever killed judge brewer Might go after you, So I decided to keep tabs on you. Well, I don't like it, but I'm glad you did it. More than anything, I'm glad you're not a killer. Hold on, speaking of which, Why would vance wanna kill judge brewer? Well, that's a long story, Which I'm gonna tell you over that glass of bourbon. All right. Charlene: You little twerp! Who the hell do you think you are? I hope you don't like that badge too much Because my lawyers are gonna be all over you in an hour. [doors thudding] [chuckles] Okay, I'm just saying, A man lends you a vehicle like that, he expects something. Oh, he's just being nice, that's it. Mm-hmm. Hey, daddy. I'm back. No need to get all emotional. [laughs] -Hey, kim. -What? How're we gonna afford to keep paying these nurses? You let me worry about that. We're family, kris. I know we hadn't been that close in the past, But I'm gonna make up for lost time. You already did, kimmie. You saved my ass. Well, I had to. Everybody around here would've missed it. -Well, that's true. -[kim laughing] Hey, I'm having a little get-together Later on at the saloon. Wouldn't be a party without you. -You in? -Are you kidding me? This jailbird needs to spread her wings. -Well, come on, girl. -All right. [kim laughing] [gentle upbeat music] ♪ how am I supposed to live without you ♪ What did that poor song ever do to her? ♪ so long ♪ ♪ how am I ♪ -[patrons clapping] [patrons cheering] The song's not done yet. Uh, whatever. Patron: Whoo-ooh! Oh, sweet lord, I mean, I get that she's in pain, But does she gotta throw it all over us? -[laughs] -I mean, she's got emotions. -Oh, she's been through a lot. -We all have now. -I'm out. Need another drink. -Me, too. I'm gonna need something stronger. All right. Barkeep, three beers, please. Enjoying ourselves, are we, missy? I'm sorry. What'd you call me? What? You mean missy? [both chuckles] You didn't remember me the other day, did you? Mm-mm. Yeah, when I was 12 years old, My daddy locked me underneath the stairs. No food, barely any water, And I sat in my filth for two days and when I got out, I ran straight to you. Begged you to go lock him up. Know what you said to me? "missy, maybe you should try being A good girl for a change." I have no idea what you're talking about. That's all right. I should be thanking you anyway. Because of you, I'm the person I am today. That's right. We girls of tonopah are fierce, And that's in part because of men like you. Y'all better watch out. I think you must have me confused with someone else. It don't matter. We girls are having a night out. -You're up, judge. -What are you talking about? Kris says you gotta a beautiful voice. I only sing in the shower. Well, then take off all your clothes And pretend it's a shower. So bossy. What am I singing? Kris: Oh, don't you worry about it. I gave you something good. Get it up there. Everyone, put your hands together For the one and only kim wheeler. -[patrons claps, cheers] -go get 'em, sis! Patron: Whoo-hoo! Come on, girls! If I'm doing this, y'all are, too.
