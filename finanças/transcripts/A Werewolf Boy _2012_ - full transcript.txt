This is everyone. Our family and Dong Seok's grandma. There is Jeong-Sook who is renting our house, but i haven't seen her for a while. By the way, I have lived in this village for more than 5 years, But it's the first time I've been in here. How many rooms are there? Oh my, there is even a telephone? Did somebody live here before? My goodness. Of course, there was someone I still don't know his profession, He never left. I couldn't speak to him normally. Then Ah hey One more soup please Then he died due to a heart attack~ Even before then, I hadn't seen him for a long time. He used to keep wolves, next to that barn He used to keep wolves, next to that barn Wow Huh? Why did he... For food? No he was studying something. Walked up and down with big books. Oh, by the way, the children are so pretty! But the school is quite far from here So you are...uhm an elementary school student, and older sister is a... Maybe you will attend High School, right?

Mom, I left something on the yard It's cold, so come back quickly! By the way, we Actually we cannot afford such a big house, but moved into because of Soon-eee's illness Doctor said she needs home treatment. What, why? Her lungs have a problem so she is preparing her qualification exam at home. I haven't seen my daughter's smile for a long time. My sister has no friends at all. Soon-ja I feel so sorry for her. Her face is white as a sheet. Why does that even matter! I didn't even come close to doing well in school, too! Wait a minute, who is that man with greased hair? He is the son of my husband's business partner. So, he is not living here? Yes. I see. He looked like a spoiled man. He was sticking his hands in his pockets while the elders were working. Why is he here? He bought this house. There are only two families in the entire village. But the villagers seem so nice. Maybe we should open the windows. The weather is cold, but it will warm up as the boiler is heated. Did you take your medicine? I just took it. What is that smell? Strange. Is there a lot of dust? Yeah. I will clean here tomorrow, so don't worry. Everything will be ok. Go to sleep. Yeah, I guess so. Ouch, I'm so tired. Moonlight, sorrow. Dark shadow inside me. My existence is meaningless.

What's that sound? Huh? Where's your sister? Mom! Where is it? Oh my, what is happening here? You should've woken me up. What, why are you here? Oh my gosh. Why are you alone? Are you hurt? Where?

I read from a newspaper that 60,000 children were abandoned during the war. It seems the child is eighteen years old, isn't it? Orphanages will not accept such a grown-up child. Stay still. Oh there is scar on his face. Oh my! Oh my! What's wrong with him? Maybe he's been abused. You must take him to the station and investigate. Isn't that the duty of a policeman? You're right, but then, i will be punished by the chief. Just kick it out, really! Okay, I will investigate this further, so keep him for a while. Wait, why me? Oh my, I have said already, 60,000 children were abandoned during the war.

He'll be shot immediately. Nothing can fool me. I can tell whether he's dangerous or not. Blood type cannot be identified. And? Sight, hearing, smell- everything is excellent A little too excellent. Body temperature is also high. How much? 46 degrees Celsius I don't think it's a fever, it appears to be natural. By the way, It must be studied further but Bone density and muscular strength are similar to a elephant. If somebody asks, say everything's normal. Yes sir. If we don't take him out of here... he won't survive. Soon-Ja! Cheol-Soo Let's play a top-spinning game. It has rained already, so how about we play a game? I have to stay at home Cheol-Soo can't play, either. Why? He just can't. Let's play next time. It was a temporary shock. Don't worry. It seems the home treatment has been more effective than I could have expected. Thank you, Doctor I was so worried. Mom Huh? Let's go back. By the way, this kid Everything's normal. And milder than expected. So, He lost his parent and is just a ill-bred kid. That's all I saw a lot of similar kids. Of course it is. And, Cheol-Soo is neater than me. Sometimes, I don't brush my teeth at night, but he even bushes after lunch! Mister Colonel! What are you talking about? Huh? You can see if from a mile away! Didn't I tell you? How he becomes a monster. He's different from us Of course! He can't speak and is unusually strong! He is.. He is a demon, isn't he? What is a demon? By the way, I am a generous person, but I can't wait around here forever. That's enough. Come here. In my opinion, He lacks social skills because he was raised among animals, But he has ability and will to learn. Although further observation is required, Presently, exterminating the kid is meaningless. Um, he has never shown violent behavior. Yeah? Then, report as nothing happened and go back? Our brother looks so handsome. Cheol-soo resembles my nephew. That bastard... That bastard has eaten goats. When? Two weeks ago? At that night.. With him at night? S, So what? I was driving by when... I saw him eating Mister Jeong's goats. Eating them? How? What? How? He was gnawing them like a wolf cub. Why are you telling us this now? I was afraid he'd attack me. You were also there, right? Why didn't you tell me? Well, I'm doing it now. Do you know? It's written all over your face that you're lying. If you want to lie, please do it properly, okay? Your childish trick makes me even more angry! What~? It's you who's pretending like you didn't see anything. Uncle You know that. Cheol-soo didn't do this! Did you see it? Him gnawing on the goats? I didn't see it but- So? I saw Cheol-Soo at the farm that night. I saw Cheol-Soo at the farm that night. Is the dead goat still there? Is the dead goat still there? Nope. But.. It didn't seem like something a beast would do. You're wrong! I see everything! Stop lying! You cursed bitch! Ji-Tae! Watch your language. Do you know who I am? Huh!? Don't you know how to behave!? You're all crazy. So we are, fighting because of that little monster, huh? Anyway, let's visit the farm tomorrow. That's enough for today. What? I have something to tell you. So what? What is it!? If it was Cheol-Soo, he wouldv'e jumped over the fence. What? If it was Cheol-Soo, he would've jumped the fence. There was no need to tear it down. But as you can see, part of the fence is completely demolished. The dead goat has broken ribs but no wounds. Visit my farm tomorrow. I have something to show you. There's a wheel track I covered up with a straw mat to preserve it. I'll show it to them. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? If you come clean, I'll say nothing. You stop persecuting innocent people and just go back to Seoul. That's all I have to say. Hey, Jeong. Hello? What? Who is that? It's a journalist. Journalist? It's Uncle Jeong. Did you really do that? I'm going in. These bumpkins! Hey, go out and look. Yes, sir. Blackout? What the hell? What are you doing? Madam! It's completely broken! What? What's broken? Do you have a screwdriver? Screwdriver? Wait I just want to talk with you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's difficult staying here, isn't it. Do you know where the guitar is? Yes, the guitar. You can play music on it. Recently, Soon-Eee has been feeling so bad. The guitar is gone. So She cannot sing and it makes her worse. She may even die. By the way, I discovered that Mr. Jeong has stolen it. Uncle who raises goats. Meeeeeh~ What bastard did this? By the way, it's a secret Soon-Eee Doesn't like you. She hates you. Cheoul-Soo Find the guitar. Then.. maybe Soon-Eee will love you. Go out and find it. Oh, it's working. -Phew, that's it. -There's light again. Huh? Where is he? Help! He is raging now! He is raging now! Huh? What? How did he escape? Where is he? Where! I'll search for him. He went to Mister Jeong's farm Maybe he wants meat. What does that mean? How do you know? I saw him on my way. Where is it? Go ahead! You may need a real gun. Gosh! What is this sound! What? Who's there! Cheol-Soo Hey Cheol-Soo, what are you doing? Oh! Why is he acting like this? Cheol-Soo!

I loved you very much Cheol-Soo Calm down and come to me Chase him down and shoot him. Cheol-Soo Are you really a monster? What is real? What is... Your true nature? But I don't care. I'm.. It's ok even if... It's ok even if..you are a monster. Soon-Eee-!! Soon-Eee-!! Hide yourself. Quickly. People are coming. I'll go to them and say you ran away, so don't follow me. Go, you idiot. If you're caught, you are dead. I can't be with you now. Go! Get lost! I hate you so get lost!! Let me go! Go! Go you idiot! Ah.. I'm sorry Cheol-soo... It's for your sake Stay! Stay! I'm leaving !

If you were together, then how do you not know! -Stop splitting hairs! You ran away together, how is it you don't know! Stop it!! Calm down. If something happens to this child, then you! What's our next move? If the operation gets bigger, it'll be up in the air. But our initial purpose was to keep it secret, wasn't it? Today there will be reporters If we keep our mouths shut, everything will be fine. Well, if nothing else, We should try to do the right thing, one more time. Let's go. We won't abandon him here forever. If he appears again, call me first. Okay? We are going to move away from here. Mom, what to do with this? I wanted to buy him new clothes, and I couldn't. Sis! Come here! Goodbye~! Bye~! Therefore, when Dong-An Corp. went bankrupt, The house was turned over to Yoo-Ok-Hee. And when she died, she left you the house. There will be a pension complex in the vicinity, so I recommend you sell it. It'll be sold at a good price. Could we spend one night here? There are no rats, I suppose? By the way Granny, why did you choose this place? I don't know You always don't. Granny, look at this. Wow~ Who is this handsome child? Good-looking, right? Yeah. Does he have some money? Not a lot, I think? Then don't mix with him. Poo, but he is so kind. Treat him well. All men like compliments. If you grow up, you can see what you couldn't before. Knowing more sounds great, but it makes you a coward. You only get one chance at life. That time never comes back Oh, hello? It's completely out-of-the-way village. Grandma? Granny is strong, you know. Yes Uh.. Oppa I'll call you later. Uh, nothing. Good night. What is this? It's a stun gun. Which papa bought last time. Somebody may break in. "Wait, I'll be right back" Me Did you wait for me? Come here. Stop waiting now Cheoul-Soo, I am sorry Why? What did you wait for? I'm sorry. I've done everything. Ate what I wanted, wore what I wanted, married another man raised children I lived like this. I'm sorry. I am an old lady now. My hairs Turned white. No. It's the same Hands, Mouth, Eyes.. You're still beautiful. So much.. I've missed you, so much Snowman And suddenly, his heart became warmer. Excellent. It's deep black like charcoal, and made of brass. Put the wood in its mouth, And it will burn, spitting flames. Are you going now? What? Did you leave something behind? Let's go Granny I saw a strange person yesterday. He looked at me for long time when I was making a call Usually, it's scary, right? but I wasn't scared. Why weren't I? Yep [Hi, it's Section Chief Kim from county office.] Yeah, wait a minute. Grandma, it's the public officer. I won't sell it. [What? Wait, you said] Thank you, for waiting me Thank you, for looking at my eyes Thank you, my dear prince For appearing in front of me All day, I wait for the moon to rise in the sky Because when night comes, I can talk to you Don't forget our promise Don't forget our secrets Don't forget how my heart raced when you spoke to me
