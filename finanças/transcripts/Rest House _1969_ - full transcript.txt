'REST HOUSE' Keeper. Keeper. Keeper! Welcome.. I'm Professor Lakshmi. This is Sister Sophia. These are my children. Did you give birth to all of them? Nonsense. They are my students. We are here for botanical research. - Oh! I got the letter from the college. Who are you? I'm Ellen Poulose from Kalluvettankuzhi. I'm the cook and keeper here. Keep quiet. Where is our room? We just have two halls here. One hall is over there. Another one is over here. We have vacated this one for you. Come on.. Are there any men staying here? No. There are no men here. What about you? Don't count me as a man. Quiet. Well, what about the food? I'll arrange everything. One more thing. - Yes? Men should not be allowed here without our permission. No one will come to stay here. Okay. - I'll arrange your coffee. Well, girls, make yourself comfortable. A peaceful place. There are no disturbances. Beautiful sight. We came during the right time. "Oh, spring!" "Spread everywhere!" "Oh, spring! Spread everywhere!" "The colourful flowers." "Oh, dear heart!" "Embrace the beauty." "Oh, spring!" "The blossomed gardens!" "The fruitful trees!" "The blossomed gardens!" "The fruitful trees!" "The green peaks" "of the mountain." "The smiling sky above." "The frozen earth below." "The smiling sky above." "The frozen earth below." "Oh, spring!"

"The bright sky above." "The awakening earth below." "Oh, spring! Spread everywhere!" "The colourful flowers." "Oh, dear heart!" "Embrace the beauty." "Oh, spring!" Good morning. Good morning.. - Good morning.. Lead kindly light. - Hail Mary.. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. About turn. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left.. Right.. About turn. Left.. Right.. Left.. Right.. Left.. Left. Right. Left. Don't look at the girls. Look forward. Left.. Right.. Left.. About turn. Left.. Right.. Left.. Right.. Team halt! Left. Right. You got it all wrong because of the girls. Raghu. Jamal. Appu. Why are you carrying a cigarette pack? Left.. Right.. About turn. Right.. Left.. Right.. Left.. Right.. Left.. Right.. Don't look at the girls. Look forward. Left.. Right.. Don't look at the girls. Left.. Right.. Don't look back. Left.. Right.. Hey! Didn't you say that there are no men here? - Yes. Are they girls who are screaming outside? Oh, no! They are smart college boys. Didn't I tell you not to let any men stay here? This is not my private property. This is a government quarters. Anyone is allowed here. Tell them to look for another place as girls are staying here. What if they ask me to tell you the same thing? Left.. Right.. They got it wrong. Left.. Right.. Left.. Right.. Please stop. - What do you want? Left.. Right.. Tell me. Left.. Right.. Only women are staying here. - We are here too. Left.. Right.. - Be serious. I'm Professor Lakshmi from My Ladies College, Madras. Left.. Right.. I'm Professor Major P.K. Das of National College of Madras. Left. Right. About turn. Nonsense. About turn. Come on! Go inside. Please. I'm a celibate. I don't talk to women. Then why did you come to a place where only women are staying? My students and I came here for botanical research. We reserved it before you. It would be better if you look for another place. We reserved it too. So you can look for another place. We won't stay in the same place with men. We have some discipline. Mind you. My students have military discipline. Remember! You came here on purpose to disturb us. - Hey! Be careful. I hate women. I hate men too. I don't care about your hatred. Women are evil. They are the cause for all destruction. Shut up! Men are frauds. You shut up! Remember that Eve was made out of a rib from Adam. Nonsense. I don't want to listen to this. Will you leave this place or not? - Absolutely impossible. Run.. Oh, no! What is this? This is a gent's washroom. This is our washroom! Let me go. - Why are you here? Leave! - Don't touch me! - Oh, no! What is this nonsense? What is this nonsense! This is my room. Look carefully. This is my room. - No. It's mine. - Get out! Oh, no! My Saree. - Is it yours? - Yes. We can't live like this anymore. We should leave this place soon. I can't stay here with these lunatics anymore. Get ready. He is the superintendent engineer I mentioned to you. I'm here as the chairman of an investigation committee. There is a ruin nearby. Some people claim that it's a temple. Others say that it belongs to an estate owner. There are people fighting over it too. That is why the government sent him here. Can you do us a favour? Can you shift the men from the rest house? Sorry. That is a public place. It is not reserved for women. Then can you arrange another place for us? They have no manners. Uncultured men. Let's just discuss our issue. We'll shift if they are staying there. Another place for us.. The mansion of the estate owner, Smith, is vacant. You can ask him. He'll definitely agree if you ask him. His family doesn't stay there either. Then you can take them to the mansion. - Okay. Thanks. I'll see you later. Poulose? - Yes. How are the girls who came with them? They are like doves! Ten girls! Ten beauties! I'll be here for a few more days. I'll arrange a program if I get a chance. We lost a golden chance. Ten beautiful girls! The girls were beautiful like pearls. Will we ever meet such beautiful girls on this hill top? - No. It was a God-given opportunity. But Professor Lakshmi came in between. She is the villain on this hill top. We could have had our chance. But your uncle ruined it. Hey, let's try one last time. Do whatever you want but those girls shouldn't leave this place. Let's meet our professor. Oh, no! Get up. You just have to come with me. I'll come. But I'll run away if he gets angry. 'The atmosphere is getting warmer.' Oh! It might be because of the lack of rain. No. Maybe it's because of the men here. Hey, it's the political atmosphere. 'Lovers committed suicide.' Good news. Pack your bags and get ready to leave. Where are we going? We'll arrange your stay in a nearby mansion. Don't we have enough facilities here? Just obey my orders! Get ready! Sir? - Yes. What's the matter? The professor and the students from next door are leaving. You mind your own business. It's an insult to us if they leave because of us. If we can adjust something.. No adjustment for ladies. Oh, God! Leave from here! At least for the sake of humanity.. Such a humanity will ruin your life. That's what women will do to you. Do you understand? You may leave. Sir, I.. - Get out! Raghu. You are a good singer, aren't you? Yes, sir. You are not allowed to sing till we leave this rest house. Why? Cows, babies and snakes will get attracted to songs. But we don't have them in the rest house. We do. In the next door. There are 11 small snakes and a big snake. Are you talking about the professor and the students? - Yes. Be careful. You can go. He won't let anyone stay here. We just have to stay for seven days. They are here with the special request from the engineer. Mr. Poulose. - Yes. After his brother, Alexander, passed away he never lets anyone stay here. Can we at least meet him? Yes. I'll call him. He is selling the estate and going back to London. He is a good man. - Yes. He'll agree if you ask him. Is that him in the picture? No. That is his elder brother's picture. His name is Alexander. The rumour is that his manager killed him. - He is coming. Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Our superintendent recommended her and ten girls to stay here because the rest house is full of boys. And they want your permission for it. All right.. You can have my outhouse. Manager. - Yes, sir. You'll make the facilities. - Yes. Thank you very much. Your face is very familiar. Is your name Mary? The daughter of late Thomas. - Yes. Clean the outhouse, Meenakshi. How does he know you? He knows my father. Maybe that's why he agreed. Let's go. Manager, we'll go now. We'll come later. - Okay. How is it going? Nuisance! Haven't I told you not to come here for temple affairs? We won't stay idle if you say that he owns our century old temple. Remember that he is a rich man before you go against him. We won't leave anyone in peace if they try to mess with us with their money. That place is for him to build a monument for his late brother. Do you have to destroy our temple for that? What is all this? Hey, the matter is not so simple. That is our religious place. If you build a monument there.. I'll do whatever I like. Get out! We'll see what will happen! We'll break the limbs of anyone who comes near the temple. Get out! - Leave.. Come and see what will happen! - Leave. Manager. - Sir. Get all these rowdies out of here. - Yes, sir. You should talk. - Raghu, you should tell. Let Balan speak. - They shouldn't leave, that's all. - Tell them. They shouldn't leave. We have a request. You shouldn't leave this place because of us. Oh, you might be planning to spend time with us. - No. It's our right to live together with women. It is needed for our youth. It sounds like you are here to get us married. We are ready for that too. We are also ready to divorce you after the wedding night. Don't try to trap us because we are girls. Hey, we won't try to trap you. Leave it. We'll leave this place. You can stay here. Thank you so much! You can leave. We belong to the same species. Why should we fight for such a small issue? The political scenario of the country will change in the future. Let's unite to save the world from extinction. Don't try to trick us. We have decided to leave. We won't spend any more time with such scums. Be careful about what you say. - Hey. - Don't say it again. What if we do? Well, if you do, we'll forgive you. You need luck for that too. Oh, God! Please make them change their decision about leaving. Amen! Anyway, I don't like to stay in his mansion. Aren't you acquaintances? Yes. My father was the manager of his brother, Mr. Alexander. Oh, no! You shouldn't stay there. Why? - People say it is haunted. Really? Is that so? Anyway, row the boat. Thomas. Please tell me where the treasure is. Do you know why you are still alive? - Yes, I know. Then tell us where the treasure is. We'll give you a share. You can live in luxury. That is public property. It belongs to God. It is a sin to steal it. To hell with your ideals! Come on! Tell me! - Hey! You are a cruel man! Didn't you kill your brother because he didn't reveal it? Keep that in mind. He has kept you alive because he cares about you. I know he wants to get the information from me. Where is the treasure? Tell me where it is. I was the manager for Mr. Alexander for a couple of decades. Unfortunately, we found the treasure while we were clearing the area around the temple. And Mr. Alexander told that it belongs to an old temple. That's the truth. He told me that as Christians, we are supposed to return it to the rightful owner. But you didn't listen to him. Everything will be fine after we get the money. God will punish you for killing your brother for other's property. I don't care about your God. Don't you want to see your daughter? Where is she? Where is my daughter, Mary? Didn't you lock me in this dungeon when you killed my boss? Where did my daughter go after that? How did she live? Who will tell me the truth? She went to Madras when she couldn't find you. She joined a nunnery. Now she is here as a nun with a bunch of girls. Is she here? I want to see my daughter. I want to see my daughter before I die. Okay, we'll arrange it. Go inside. Aren't we leaving? We won't leave for now. We'll stay here till we get another place. Go inside. We'll meet the superintendent again. Come on, Sister.

Why did you come here? Did you come here to stare at women? - No, sir. No, sir! What do you mean by that? What business do you have with these girls? No business, sir! - No business! Nonsense. I'll cancel the camp if you repeat it again. Get ready for the bus. Yes, sir. Were you here too? I was saved from my uncle by luck. But we'll lose our chance if we are not careful. He hurt my hand with his stick in anger. Leave it.. I'll catch it. I will.. I will catch it. Go to your place. - Yes, sir. S-Sir, there is a new butterfly. You can't catch the butterfly beyond this line. Go to your place. Yes! Miss. There is a new herb. Really? Here. You can't study the plants beyond this line. Go to your place. Boys. All right. Quick march. Boys! About turn. 'Smoking is injurious to health.' Take the boat, we need to go to the other side. The boat is under repair. - Did the tyre get punctured? To hell with your repair! Take it. The boat will sink. - Then you may get out. We'll go. Don't you've to repair now? - It's his trick. Let's get in. That's it. - I told you not to get in.. - Keep quiet. Catch her. - Don't leave her. - Stop. - Stop there. I asked you to stop. Tell the truth. Where are you going? Don't play any tricks. Tell us the truth. Or else, we'll call the police. I'm the servant at the foreigner's home. I think it must belong to some old temple. I've got things like these a couple of times. The jewels and artefacts from our country are bought by the foreigners at a huge price. I think the smuggling group is somewhere near. That's why the police are guarding this place. We found this piece of paper along with this idol. 'Sending through captain.' 'Await further. X.' We can understand that things like these are sent abroad through this captain. We can know the truth if we catch the guys who were there with the girl who died. We'll catch them for sure. - Thank you for your help. So let us leave. Don't make us the culprits when you file the case. Goodbye. I don't know anything about her death. Someone must have killed her to take revenge. Wasn't she the maid here? - Yes. She's been here for a long time. - When did she leave last day? L-Like always. At night. Did she have any connection with the smugglers? - We don't know. There are some secrets behind it. Okay. I'm putting some policemen to watch this place. That's good. - Thank you, sir. Hey, Lakshmi. - What is it? I don't know Hindi, Lakshmi. You may learn it. - You learn it first. Why should just we learn it? You should learn our language too. Then only will we be united. We are one nation. Talk to me. I'll teach you. I don't understand your language at all. What? - I'm in love with you. Do you love me? - Yes. Strong love. All India love. My dear. What is this? - I was clearing my doubt. Nonsense. - I'm sorry. I took the wrong plant. I asked you to go away. - I'm going. - Come on. Hey. What is this? What is it? - What are you looking at so carefully? Don't talk.. Look.. - Tell me the matter. - Look. - Did you see? It's nice.. - What? Enjoy it, Balan. Look. If it goes like this, the Saree will fall off in a matter of time. The three musketeers are checking us out. Come on. What? - Nothing. Who all are there at home? - Why? I thought of coming. - Is there anything special? I'm alone. - So am I. So, the route is clear. Read this letter. Ma'am.. - Oh, no, don't do it. Don't stay here anymore. Let's go. Wait.. - One doubt. Have you nailed this Saree on your hip? Why? - It's not coming off. - Is it? Are you waiting for the Saree to fall off? We were saying, a piece of cloth would be enough if the trend goes like this. - Yes.. You don't need to worry. Let's go. Hello. Good morning. Good morning. - The answer for my.. Aren't you in love with me? Not love, that is.. - Which means, real love. I'll be coming to your home, Kamaladevi. Don't try to steal a beggar's meal. Panchali had five husbands. Did you know? Then I'll get the fat professor. - Okay. Stay here. You're a bad omen. If we stay near this cemetery the ghosts will kill us. Do you know? Is it? Let's see then. Haven't you heard about Alexander's ghost killing people, Pachu Pillai? Ghosts are a lie. How many people have died here? Moreover, it's Friday. The ghost will come around 1 o'clock. We'll arrest that ghost today. - You may do it. I'm not coming. I'm leaving. Oh, God. Why are you screaming? - Ghost.. - Where? - Ghost. He killed him and ran away. Did you see the ghost killing the constable? - I just saw it, sir. I was lying on the ground when I came back to my senses. People have been complaining about the ghost. We can't handle the ghosts. My children will lose their father. Don't we need to know the truth? - It's the ghost of Alexander. He comes out of his grave on his death anniversary. And kills everyone he meets till the next new moon. It's our duty to end it. But there is no law for it. Only humans can be caught. Can we arrest a ghost? We must do it if needed. Today I'll come for the patrol too. - Yes. The locals are saying, it's better not to go out for 15 days. - Damn! Keeper.. Keeper.. - Nonsense! - Nonsense. Ask them to leave. - Yes. Tell them, it's not their dad's property. - Yes. Don't abuse. - Hey, I'm hungry. Serve the food. - Yes. It's better for you to leave than to fight. Okay, we'll have a truce. We can eat together. - Ask your wife. I asked you since I don't have a wife. - Shut up! You shut up! Hey, don't serve it to them. We came here first. It's your duty to serve food to the ones who come. Keep it here. Okay, I'll keep it here. Do as you wish. - Come on. Eat. Don't touch it. We're not your servants to eat your leftovers. - Let's see. Don't leave.. - Leave it.. Oh, God. Don't think that you've won. - Girls always lose. Remember it. We'll defeat you. - Are you in for a bet? - Yes. We won't live as women if we don't take revenge on you. Come on. Goal! Very good, boys. Well done. Timeout. What is this? Oh, God. Never mind. Useless! Foul.. My God. Shame.. You're not my students. Aren't you ashamed? You got lost in their smile and lost your dignity. You're not my students. Sir.. - You may go. Don't come to me. Be ready to leave tomorrow at 6.a.m. Get ready. Oh, God. Let bygones be bygones. Forgive us, this time. I don't want your explanation. Evaporate! Extinguish! They've lost. - Oh, God. The professor has lost. - Oh, God. The captain has lost. - Oh, God. Take it. - The embarrassment. Take it. - Captain. "Such an insult!" "Such an embarrassment!" "Such an insult! Such an embarrassment!" "The tuskers who've stumbled." Goodbye.. "Such an insult! Such an embarrassment!" "The tuskers who've stumbled." "The tuskers who've stumbled.." "Pack up." "Say goodbye." "Pack up. Say goodbye." "We'll get you the tickets. - For the bus." "We'll get you the tickets. - For the bus." "We'll get you the tickets. - For the bus." "Such an insult! Such an embarrassment!" "The tuskers who've stumbled." "The tuskers who've stumbled.." "Wearing trousers. - Wearing trousers." "The mascots of bad luck. - The mascots." "Wearing trousers. The mascots of bad luck." "The Romeo of the college has lost." "Lost.. Lost miserably." "Oh, God.." "Oh, God. The professor is fainting." "Oh, God. The captain is lost in love." "Lost in love.." "Such an insult! Such an embarrassment!" "The tuskers who've stumbled." "The tuskers who've stumbled.." "The spikes and the tummy." "What can it do on the court?" "The spikes and the tummy." "What can it do on the court?" "The scoreboard is empty." "The scoreboard is empty." "How many zeroes did we put? - Oh, God." "How many zeroes did we put?" "Oh, God.." "The males are devotees." "They're the saints" "who worship the zeroes." "Fake saints." "Such an insult! Such an embarrassment!" "The tuskers who've stumbled." "The tuskers who've stumbled.." "The ones wearing the glasses" "the ones with a fake moustache" "who came to play have lost." "They failed.. Miserably." "Oh, God. - Oh, God. - Oh, God. - Oh, God." "Oh, God. The professor is fainting." "Oh, God. The captain is lost in love." "Lost in love.." "Such an insult! Such an embarrassment!" "The tuskers who've stumbled." "The tuskers who've stumbled.." "Pack up." "Say goodbye." "Pack up. Say goodbye." "We'll get you the tickets. - For the bus." "We'll get you the tickets. - For the bus." "We'll get you the tickets. - For the bus." "We'll get you the tickets. - For the bus." It was like selling the sun to buy a candle. We let go of our dignity to talk to the girls. What happened in the end? We lost! - Don't worry. I saw an English film. We'll teach them a lesson in the same way. - How? The hero is coming with a revolver. Get out! Everybody join in. I've got a gang. Don't move. All right. Come on. She's coming with the money. - And then the police came. Congratulation. Wonderful. I've never seen such a game in my lifetime. Thank you. He was talking about your game all the way. I love games. Especially, if girls are playing. So sweet! Don't you have a wife? It's hard to count the number of wives he has. Did you come to get us? - No.. Nothing like that. It's only sportsman spirit. And if you need anything, tell me. Thank you for your help. Poulose. - Sir. - She played great. Don't stay so. You must participate in world games. Just give her a push. She'll achieve many things. I'm ready to do all I can. So, may we go to our room? - Yes. See you later. Bye.. Hello, Superintendent. - Hello.. - Hello. - Hello. When did you come? - Just now. - Do you want tea or coffee? Nothing. - Have something. - No, thank you. Saying bye like this is not good for health. Have you started to play with the head? He is a perfect gentleman. He doesn't talk with girls. You've misunderstood me. Superintendent. Be careful while dealing with college students. Hey, can I take him out? Please don't do it in here. All right. Even talking to you won't suit me. - Is it? Then.. - Don't go. Stay. You won't have your legs to go back if you come here again. Oh, God. Thief.. - Oh, God. Thief.. They took all our ornaments. He took my necklace too. - Oh, God. Remove it quickly. - Make it fast. Pour that ink on your face. They'll think that it's blood. - Idea. We'll call the police in the morning. Go to sleep, everybody. Oh, God. - Oh, God. - Oh, God. - Oh, God. What is this? Get up. Were these ornaments stolen from here? Oh, God. Yes. - Have a look. The tribals took it from us. - Those tribals.. They came into our room too. They didn't quit, so even we didn't. Then a group fight. - What a fight! - Group fight. They beat us to a pulp. What a fight? - What a fight? - Water.. We followed him. A big fat guy. - Beat us to a pulp. Every hit felt like a 100 pound. There was a skinny guy holding a revolver with him. Anyway, we got thrashed. Did you get your ornaments? - Yes. - Did you see this? Blood.. - Tomorrow.. We're going to consult a doctor tomorrow. Drink it. Thank you for your help. - Enough. Give it to him. Give it to him. Hey, Raghu. - Yes. Keep your hands here. Is my chest beaten to a pulp? - Hey. It's a bit bad. Leave it. They must not be harmed when they are staying with us. You suffered a lot for us. We won't forget this help, ever. Can you do us a favour? - We're obliged to do anything. Our professor has asked us to leave in the morning since we lost the match. If you come and tell our professor about what we did tonight maybe, he'll let us stay. He called us undignified and spineless. And scolded us. Please come with us and talk to him. We'll be relieved. Do it if you can. Otherwise, it's okay.. May God bless you. - Bless you. - Bless you. - Wait. We'll tell him. What do you say? Okay. You may go. Wait. Where are you all going? Just a couple of you may go. Leela, Sathi, Latha. We'll go. All of you, go to sleep. Come in. Did you get me? Poor girls. They got scared. I didn't expect them too. No, why are you in this.. Because you wore it. It's not manly to scare girls at midnight by wearing a tribal dress. Now, didn't you courageous guys get scared? Don't hide anything from me. I'll find it out. I won't do it ever again. I've to give that dress back. - Take it.. You are always working, Poulose. How well built was he? Now, he's all skin and bones. We're lucky that he is our keeper. - Yes. You're flattering me. We are always frank. Poulose. - Yes. - We're thirsty. Don't you see it? - Tell me what you want. Do you want cold water or curd? I'll give you anything. It's the thirst of our mind. The girls are hitting on us. Yes. Everybody is chained here. Listen, Oulo.. Poulose. We need to open our hearts to them. Is it all? I will take care of it. Poulose, then.. Give this letter to my friend, Leela. This is for my sweetheart, Sathi. This is for my heroine, Latha. - Latha. Don't you need something to drink? Here, take it. I don't need in instalments. Give it as a whole amount. Do you have to say it? We'll give you. God bless. Let's go. - Yes. Bring it quickly, Poulose. - Coming. Didn't I come here first? Don't you need it hot? I'll heat it and bring. I need this. - Don't eat it. I'll bring you another one. No issues. You can have it. - Pour the Chutney. 'Darling.' 'I don't know how to express my love.' 'We must meet, today evening.' 'I'll be waiting.' 'From your dearest.' What is this? Hey, tell me the truth. Who gave you this letter? Someone might have mixed it with the dough, ma'am. I'll dismiss you if you tell lies. - Oh, God. He must've done it. Leela, Latha, Sathi. Do you know anything about this? We.. We know nothing, ma'am. - Okay. Then I must put an end to this. Keeper. - Yes. - Follow me. - Yes. Sir. Yes. - A letter for you. Ma'am sent this for you. For me? - Yes. 'Darling.' 'I don't know how to express my love.' 'Let's meet each other if you like me too.' 'I'll wait for you.' 'Yours..' What nonsense! Prof. Lakshmi loves me! She wants to meet me! Where is she! How dare you write a love letter to me? Divine Love! Don't you have shame? Stop it! I am not here to love a crazy person like you. Then, what is this? - This is a trick played by your students. My students wrote a love letter! To whom? - To my girls. Your boys kept it in my girls' food. Wait. Latest trick in the history of love! Love letter in food! Punish them immediately for their prank. Confucius said that even a mother and son shouldn't stay together alone. The ambiance gives way to emotion. Don't profess. Your boys should never write letters to my girls. That's all. Your girls should never provoke my boys to write it too. That's all. Lord Krishna! Your pranks! "Oh, river Yamuna.." "Oh, river Yamuna.." "The symbol of love.." "Where is Lord Krishna?" "Where is Lord Krishna?" "Where is that handsome lover?" "Where is that handsome lover?" 'Where is the charming flute player?" "Where is Lord Krishna?" "In the serene night drenched in moonlight" "I made a floral bed for you." "In the serene night drenched in moonlight" "I made a floral bed for you.." "After heeding your heartfelt invitation" "how will I resist my arrival?" "After heeding your heartfelt invitation" "how will I resist my arrival?" "How will I resist my arrival?" "Here I am, my dear Radha." "Here I am." "When I desired to hear the tune of your flute" "the gentle breeze teased me" "and made fun of me." "In the eternal ocean of your love" "how can I not swim?" "How can I not swim?" "Here I am, my dear Radha." "Here I am, Radha." Lord Krishna! Lord Krishna! What happened? Nothing. What happened? Nothing. I-I had a nightmare. You might be scared. Pray to God and sleep. Good night. - Good night.. Who came into your dreams? Her boyfriend, who else! Oh! You and your truths! Stop teasing. All of you have a crush on someone. This is nothing new. Every woman needs a man. It is hard to live without a mate. That is true. Life without a companion will be boring. I don't have a boyfriend or dreams. Lord Krishna! Gently. They will come running if they hear us. Oh, no! What happened? Ghost! - Where? - There! Run! Where is it? It disappeared. It might have gone to the cemetery. What are you doing here? We were following a ghost. No! It will kill you. Leave, kids. We will catch the ghost. Thalikotta Temple.. - Belongs to us.. Give us the right.. - To freedom of religion.. To hell with.. - Mr. Smith.. Don't create a scene or we will arrest you. This temple belongs to us. Now it is owned by Mr. Smith. We will protest against it. We will kill the traitors. Hail.. - Thalikotta Temple.. You can't enter until the commission's order is here. We will enter. We will retrieve our rights no matter what. Come on. You can't go in. - We will. What is this? - Stop. Who are you? Count us as a few of the patriotic students of this country. This is none of your business. We have the right to know what is happening in our country. You should fight against this atrocity. We will fight against atrocities. What is the matter? This property belongs to Thalikotta Temple since ages. Now, a foreigner came and acquired them all. Why does he need this temple? This temple was ruined during Tipu Sultan's attack. People believe that priceless treasures golden statues and gems are buried in here. He might be planning to excavate the treasure and sell it in the foreign market. That is the truth. You are young. Help us solve this issue. Mr. Smith bribes and influences whoever comes to investigate about this. Have you not mentioned it to the leaders? There are many political parties in here as in the cities. One party opposes the other. Will anything happen then? Our country is like this because of the rivalry between parties. We too have parties. But we unite for the public interest. Okay. We will find a solution for this. Inspector. Please don't do anything until then. Hail.. - Thalikotta Temple.. Hail.. - Thalikotta Temple.. Cheers. - Cheers. The report came in our favour because of your kindness. Keep that in mind. 'Drinking alcohol is injurious to health. I'll give you a good present. - Thank you. We will pay you the amount we agreed. I trust him. My word is my deed. I am well aware of it. I'll meet you again. What are you doing here? He is here to drink since he is thirsty. He is an honest officer. He might be here to get his commission for preparing the report in favour of Mr. Smith. Who are you to ask? I'll do what I like. Hey, I don't think this will be easy. Who are these people? Manager. - Yes. Why did you let these people come in without my permission? Why are you here? To be honest we are a bit badass. So it is better to give the temple back to the devotees without a fight. I won't give my property. He is going back to England after building a memorial for his brother there. If you don't heed to us you will have to erect one for yourself too. Mr. Smith. Don't create unnecessary troubles. I don't want your damn advice. If you give us a drink, we will also say 'we don't give a damn either'. - Shut up! You shut up.. - Stop it. Manager. We won't leave until you give the temple back to the devotees. We will arrange another place to build a peaceful resting place for his brother. It was Mr. Alexander's last wish to build it there. Our wish is to return the temple back to the people. I'll give them a place and Rs. 50,000 for the temple. They don't want your charity. Return the temple to the people. I will not part with my property. You can go. - Oh! I don't think he will return in one piece. Get out, you rowdies. Shut up! Do you know who we are? Sir, please don't fight. Please. - We won't leave until the property is given back. Come on. Your students are trying to interfere in the temple issue for their profit. - No.. You see, youth should come forward to fight such issues. The senior politicians' worn out attitude of not letting go of their power is the main reason for political polarity and disparity of our country. That is politics. Advise your students not to interfere in this issue. That's impossible. They will do what is right. They have the right. But it is not fair. That's what you think. But according to the conscience, it is justifiable. Mister. We can do what is right to our conscience. They are here for a botanical tour. Don't interfere and create problems. I never taught them to stand idle at the time of injustice. Students are the rising future of the society. All right. Don't worry. This is a love tree. Here it is. Collect the specimens you need. Why are you doing this? I thought you might at least touch me. Stop flirting and do your job. What is the fun in that? Right now, my study subjects are women and love. Your means are crooked. The end justifies the means. Isn't that a political quote? If necessary, I'll create a coalition committee and fight for my love. Then I am walking out of this meeting. Oh, no! - Throw it away and think about us. What about us? The normal things everyone does. Tell me what it is. In a deserted place a beautiful lady is sitting alone. The young man approaches. What will you do? I'll walk away. Like this he touches you. Someone will see. Fear is the first sign of love. And he takes her in his arms.. What are you doing? You are beautiful. Wonderful. Sathi! Hamsa. - Yes. My heart is aching. Why? We will depart after a few days. Let's live here. Give me a word. Let's live here till the flood. No, we will die in the flood. Let's live together and die.. I will come along, Raghavan. I will come to your house, Hamsavalli. Oh, so both of you love me, don't you? Shridharan. Don't compete with your own friend. Don't fall for that smile. He is very tricky. Beware. Look who is saying! Get lost! You ruined everything. Stupid. "I got the most precious pearl." "I got the most precious pearl." "I got the most valuable gem."

Where is he? He is hiding after killing Mr. Alexander. I am sure that my father will never do it. We are hiding him from the police, Sister. He will tell me the truth once we meet. I will arrange it. We will leave within a few days. I will arrange it today if possible, and inform you. I'll be waiting. Keep this as a secret. Have you collected the specimens from the places we've visited? Yes, ma'am. - Good. Tomorrow onwards, let's study about underwater plants. There is a lake nearby. There are different types of old underwater plants in it. Few girls are here to meet you. Who are they? Praise the Lord. Now and forever. Who are you? We came to the Kurisummoottil Church to attend a festival. We missed our last bus. What else? Don't eat your nails! What is the use of living if someone harms these girls while I travel with them? So, we will sleep here tonight and leave tomorrow morning. We don't have the facility for it. We will adjust here. They said that some wicked boys live next door. That is true. They are crooked. Let them stay here tonight. Where will they go at night? Okay. Leela. Let them stay here tonight. Come on, Sister. God! Now I am at peace. Ma'am. Are they your daughters? Yes, dear. She is my first born. Annakutty. She is the middle one. Marykutty. Where is the other? Here. She is the last one. Allekutty. Her friends call her a stick since she is thin. Are you studying? I dropped out. Mother is in search of a groom to marry me off. What is your name? - Leela. What a pretty face! Right, Mother? Then marry her. I don't mind. I want a dress like this, Mother. What is your name? - Sathi. I like this girl very much. Where are you from? - Ernakulam. Their father had business in Ernakulam. Where is he? It is a tragedy like Moses', dear. We had rubber plantations. One day, my husband climbed the tree to tapper it. He fell from the tree and died. Ma'am. Don't cry. How can I not? Three of them had only one father. It is fate. We are here tonight to check our fate. Hey! Control. Or their teachers will kick us out. Seems like she is naughty. They all are naughty. They are not like they look. She, the middle one is the most disobedient. - Mother! Dear, dance and entertain us. I don't know how to dance. Don't you dance, Sathi? She knows very well. Dear, we can't come here again. Do it. I will do it. Do it. As we have decided, let's start for the lake at 6 a.m. I have arranged everything. What about the food for the lady and her girls? Poulose will take care of it. We won't let you go until we teach you a lesson. Stop it. Don't forget that we are boys. Don't be so proud. Boys and girls should have some adjustments. We did this when you didn't adjust. Come on, boys. Good night. - Good night. Sister.. Keeper.. Mr. Das! Don't enter into a bachelor's room at night. I came here because of your boys. They came to our room disguised as women. Take it easy. They might be joking. I will complain to the police if this repeats. Ma'am, don't threaten me. Mind you. I am an ex-military officer. Major P.K. Das. We will show you. - Yes. Let them disguise themselves as men. Absurd! - Shut up! Ma'am. The foreigner has sent an invitation. - What's the matter? Today is his brother's death anniversary. He has invited us to the memorial service. Should we go? It is for a dead person. You should go. That is not right. We should go together. Okay. As you wish. This is the report by the officer who inspected this case. 'This land is a part of Mr. Smith's estate.' 'Earlier, this was a rest house.' 'The claim of a temple is a false testimony by the villagers.' 'The government approves that this property' 'belongs to Mr. Smith after studying all the records.' Trespassing is a punishable offence. We are against this report. He bribed the officer to fabricate the report. If you dare to nullify our rights remember that we will riot. Tell us what we should do. Inspector. - We are ready to die. We believe that this is a temple and it belongs to them. The law is against it. - We don't care. We will rewrite the law. We will prosecute the officer, who discriminated them, publicly. Don't interfere and mind your own business. We, the youth, will oppose those who use their money and power for discrimination. We will acquire this temple and make it a public property. - Hail Thalikotta Temple.. Hail.. - Thalikotta Temple.. Police should obey rules! - Police should obey rules.. Police should obey rules! - Police should obey rules.. Police should obey rules! - Police should obey rules.. What nonsense! We won't sit idle if you dare to hurt my students. Then ask them to go back. This property belongs to Mr. Smith. I oppose the rule formulated by denying the citizens their rights. This is their worship place. Hail Prof. Das. - Hail Prof. Das.. Hail Prof. Das. - Hail Prof. Das.. Hail.. Thanks. Inspector I have a request. Don't let Mr. Smith have it for now. Let me call the minister and meet the political leaders in here. Proceed only after that. Come on, boys. Hail Prof. Das. - Hail Prof. Das.. Hail.. Father of all, we come before your holy presence at this moment of grief and sorrow. We are gathered here in the memory of our departed brother and friend, Mr. Alexander. You can meet your daughter now. We have conducted the mass here only for this. Come. The spirit of cheerfulness despite the troubles and turmoils of the world. And the Christian charity which was his motto in life. Dear. If you tell us the secret of the treasure you can live with your daughter. Help us to emulate all his goodness in his own life. That we may thus witness for this. Our esteemed brother and our Lord and saviour, Jesus Christ. Amen. - Amen. Sister. Where is my father? - He came here and saw you, Mary. But a police inspector came at that time. Please take me to my father. - We shouldn't go there. He is hiding in a hidden cave. Nothing will happen if I meet him. You shouldn't meet him today. I will arrange a meeting for you to meet your father, Sister. Sister.. - Okay, please go now. You shouldn't go to the temple property until the government issues another order. That's my own property. Why isn't the case over yet? The owner of the land is not able to get inside the property. The public is against it. I don't care about the public. We will take over our property. You shouldn't do it when the public is against it. I can't wait a minute. It's a government order. - Don't threaten me. You can go. We have doubt that you are behind the death of your servant. Therefore, you shouldn't go out of this bungalow without my orders. Mr. Smith, this is my order. Is this the plant you were talking about, ma'am? - Yes. Oh, no. There is a snake. It's a snake. - Run. Oh, no. It's a snake. Oh, no. Kill it. Oh, no. That's a snake. - Kill it. Oh, God! Catch the snake. I am sorry. - I am also sorry. Sir, the snake escaped. - Yes. The snake will escape. Aren't you the one who tried to kill it? - Yes, sir. You go and continue your work. - Okay. Everyone, go back to your work. Please be careful. Did you get scared? - No. I scared you. That's all right. I didn't do it purposefully. Forgive me. It's okay. Anyone can hug someone else in situations like these. Thanks. - No mention. Let me remind you that my boys got rid of the snake. - I agree. Girls were shocked and stood still. - I agree. But you shouldn't believe that women are devils. My opinion changed. Come here. Forward! Quick march! Halt! Okay. Forward march. Good morning. Oh, Lord Krishna, you are the king in the world of love. You invoked the feeling of love inside a rough man like me. Sir, did you call me? - Nothing.. Raghu. - Sir. Raghu, the surroundings have changed suddenly. It has got a new light and feeling. Isn't it? I can't see any change, sir. It's still the same. No.. Nature is calling someone. I can't hear it, sir. Yes, it does. Please listen carefully. Look at that. The breeze is caressing the clouds. Nature has become an elixir in the light of the moon. You have suddenly become an admirer of beauty. An unknown feeling has changed my perspective of life. Please sing a song to praise the nature as you are an artist. Oh, no, sir. The cruel ladies in the next door will come here. No. They won't do anything now. You should sing a song by losing yourself in that moonlight. Please go. - Okay, sir. "The full moon touched me." "The symphony of lotus smiled back." "Hey, gorgeous, your smile invited me." "The vines of dreams glowed with joy." "My vines of dreams glowed with joy." "The full moon touched me." "The symphony of lotus smiled back." "Hey, gorgeous, your smile invited me." "The vines of dreams glowed with joy." "My vines of dreams glowed with joy." "I lost myself in your deep blue eyes" "like a soft musical symphony of spring". "I lost myself in your deep blue eyes" "like a soft musical symphony of spring". "My feelings have danced along with the waves" "of your dreams." "My feelings have danced along with the waves" "of your dreams." "The full moon touched me." "The symphony of lotus has smiled back." "Hey, gorgeous, your smile invited me." "The vines of dreams glowed with joy." "My vines of dreams glowed with joy." "In the blooming vines of asparagus" "the wind has made a bed." "In the blooming vines of asparagus" "the wind has made a bed." "Please make another bed" "to share some sweet joys, my dear." "Please make another bed" "to share some sweet joys, my dear." "The full moon touched me." "The symphony of lotus has smiled back." "Hey, gorgeous, your smile invited me." "The vines of dreams glowed with joy." "My vines of dreams glowed with joy." Where is Balan? Please sit here. I will bring him now. I want to go back soon. Ma'am will get worried. I will be back. I have brought her here by saying that her lover, Balan, called her. Please don't create a scene. Send her back soon. Keep it. - Can you give some more? Don't worry. My boys.. What is the name of that girl? Sathi. - My boys will find her. They are my students. They are trained like that. Raghu. - Sir. Balan. - Sir. - Appu. Why are you hiding? You should find Sathi at any cost. This is a prestige issue. You can go. - Okay, sir. Come on. Where did she go alone? Did she meet with an accident? Don't worry. Calm down and go back to sleep. Yes. Good night.. Mr. Poulose. Why did you hide from us? I didn't put down the fire in the furnace. I am going to put down the fire. Did you see my friend, Sathi? No. I am coming back from the market. Okay, bye. Did you go to the market without putting down the fire? Tell me the truth. Did you see Sathi? I don't know anything. Oh, no.. Don't kill me. - Tell me.. Oh, no. I will tell you the truth. Contractor, you didn't drink much today. I will fall asleep if I drink more. Damn.. You shouldn't sleep. She will fly away like a bird. Really? Who are you? Why did you come here? Nothing. - Don't be scared. Oh, no. Please save me. Oh, no. - Don't shout. Hold her. Oh, no. Oh, no. Please don't beat us. Please don't beat us. Don't beat us. Don't beat us. Oh, no. - Don't move. Aristocrats like you try to rape the girls who stay over here. We should torture them publically so that the other officers don't repeat this. No. We should discuss with the professor and do the needful. Go. Walk! Walk! Did you see? They are the aristocrats of this village. One is a powerful government employee. Another one is a forest contractor. The third one is an important person in here. We should punish him as Velu Thampi Dalawa did. We should beat him in front of the public. Inspector, please arrest them and take necessary actions. I can't do it, sir. I will file the case. My students have caught these anti-social people. That's true, sir. There will be politicians and parties to protect them. I will get a transfer for arresting them. If the people who should maintain the law forget their duty for money and power then the current youth will undertake their duties. I will be their leader if it's needed. You can do what you want to. We should have punished them, sir. - No.. We shouldn't do it. We are not supposed to take the law into our own hands. Come on, boys. Let's see what happens. Leaders, don't think that you have escaped. We should teach him a lesson today. He shouldn't cheat us anymore. Oh, no. - Oh, no. Oh, no. - Oh, no. What are you doing? - Oh, no. Oh, no. Get down. - Oh, no. Oh, no. Jesus Christ will not forgive me. I obeyed them because I was scared that I would lose my job if I didn't listen to them. You shouldn't hang yourself because of that. What is it, Poulose? I wanted to do penance for my sins. Like you say, 'for if you forgive the others their trespasses' 'your heavenly Father will also forgive you.' We forgive you. Mr. Poulose. - Yes. Please buy a packet of cigarette for me. - Okay. Go far and buy it. Okay? - Okay. I got Rs. 10. Don't come back soon. - Excuse me. Ma'am and professor are not here. We should utilise this time by talking to each other. Is that it? Come on. Come on.. Don't stay here. Come on, Leela. Come on.. I saved you by risking my life. Don't forget it. I will never forget it. Promise me. - I promise you. You will break the promise after we return. It won't happen. It will be nice to stay here forever. Oh, no. Not really. I can't climb these hills during my old age. Don't worry. Lovers will be young forever. We won't be able to find you after this camp. Latha, please don't complicate our love because of this doubt. No. I trust you. Let your trust save you. I will do anything to make this love a success. I promise you.. - I promise you.. In this sacred kitchen.. I promise to be with you forever.. Poulose. - Oh, no. Oh, no. I got a stomach ache. - I got a stomach ache, Sister. Sister, we have a stomach ache all over the body. We have a stomach ache from head to toe. I have severe stomach ache in my chest. Nobody is here to give us water. Not even Mr. Poulose. Why didn't you give them hot water? Oh, no. These cruel ladies didn't give us water, Sister. We were scared that ma'am will scold us. We should help people in need. You can go. I will bring hot water for you. No. You don't need to come. Please send three glasses of hot water with them. Come on. - Oh, no. Let us go and sit in the hall. Oh, no. - Oh, no. Oh, no. - Oh, no. Please don't be discouraged. My students and I will not give up on this until the townsfolk gets justice. We got this now. - Thanks. 'With due respect towards the feelings of people' 'we open this old Thalikotta Temple' 'to the public for worshipping'. 'Along with that, the officers who cheated the public' 'will be punished according to the law'. Students. We stood united without any differences and this victory is the result of that. The benefit of the public is more important than the politicians. That is my principle. You and your brave students have done this service for us. W-We will never forget this. Sir.. We are in trouble. - What is the matter? The government has ordered to open the temple to the public. What nonsense? - It's true, sir. Along with that, they have sent a report and fired our officer. That's very serious. - It's really serious, sir. We should do something before the public takes over the temple otherwise, our plans will fail. Come on. Let's go. - Yes. We will give enough properties for you to live happily. Don't suffer here. Please tell us about the treasure. I won't tell you anything. Thomas, be happy with your daughter. Your daughter will go back from here tomorrow. You will never be able to see her again in your lifetime. What is your decision? Are you going to cheat my daughter? Write a letter to her. Why should I? Write a letter saying that you want to meet her in the bungalow. I won't write it. Oh, no. Come on. Write. I'll write.. Come on, write it. My dear students. And my dear Lakshmi. I'm sorry. Prof. Lakshmi. We are going to depart from here tomorrow. We came from different places and met here in this rest house. Keeping aside all our hatred and jealousy we are going to depart with the sweet memories of love, friendship and happiness. I hope our friendship will motivate us in attaining our future goals. Wish you all good luck. Raghu, I request you to make us happy by singing a song. "Even the voiceless Veena will sing" "if it is touched by the divine fingers of love." "Even the wordless Veena will sing." "Even the voiceless Veena will sing." "Our youthfulness is the sculptor" "who carves the heaven out of our dreams." "Our youthfulness is the sculptor" "who carves the heaven out of our dream." "With the blue eyes" "you wrote the chants of affection." "We will never forget.." "We will never forget this beautiful song." "Even the voiceless Veena will sing" "if it is touched by the divine fingers of love." "Even the wordless Veena will sing." "Even the voiceless Veena will sing." "Blended by the thoughts" "you showered your smile on me." "Blended by the thoughts" "you showered your smile on me." "Even if it does take me ages" "we shall unite in the end." "We shall never separate.." "Our hearts shall never be separated." "Even the voiceless Veena will sing" "if it is touched by the divine fingers of love." "Even the wordless Veena will sing." "Even the voiceless Veena will sing." She is dead. - Is it? Oh, my God! - Was she killed as well? What shall we do now? - Let's inform the professor. We will take her to our chapel. - Yes, sir. Raghu! Raghu! Did he escape? We have caught many crooks, but this guy has outplayed us. We better leave from here. - Come, let's go. Let's not make it late. We should call the police. It's not necessary. We'll inform them next morning. No, we should call them now itself. Let's go, sir. Manager! - Appu, you should stay here. Sir, call them on the phone. Hello.. The telephone is not working. - Is it not working? Hello! Hello! It's like this sometimes. This is a hilly region. A tree might have fallen onto the lines. I will go and inform them. - Sir, you don't need to go. We can go. - Don't go now. It's dangerous. It's okay. I will go. - All right, then. Be careful! There won't be any boat. It will be difficult for the next 15 days. The power went off! - Where is the torch? Where is the manager? - The foreigner is missing as well. Who is it? What is this? Get up! Get up. Sir, sister's corpse isn't here. Oh, no! Where is our teacher? What? Where has she gone? What is happening? - A ghost. We don't know what happened. - Nonsense! There is something fishy about it. I have my doubts, sir. Please take care of them. Appu. Appu, what is happening? The figure we saw that day. Sir. If we don't come back by tomorrow morning you can leave with them. We won't come back without finding it out. Be careful. - Come on. Sir! - Don't be afraid. I will be with you, no matter what happens. "Where is the lamp?" "Oh, abandoned shore, where is the lamp?" "Where is the lamp?" "Oh, abandoned shore, where is the lamp?" "The darkness of the night" "has made our planet earth tremble in fear." "The darkness of the night" "has made our planet earth tremble in fear." "Where is the lamp?" "The river bank has tales" "of shadows and fear to tell." "Of shadows." "The wind carries the smell of warm blood" "from the cemetery, reminiscence of death." "The reminiscence of death." "Where is the lamp?" "The grasp of the ominous black river" "has disturbed the wind and shattered hopes." "Shattered hopes." "The smell of death is all over." "Even the numb mountains are weeping." "Where is the lamp?" "Oh, abandoned shore, where is the lamp?" "The darkness of the night" "has made our planet earth tremble in fear." "Where is the lamp?" "Oh, abandoned shore, where is the lamp?" Who is he? He is the butler at Mr. Smith's mansion. So, he was the ghost who murdered sister. A police inspector shot him in the chest, but it didn't harm him. See this. He has got an iron armour. What a guy! Mr. Smith has a motive behind all this. We must not leave him. Come on, get up. Get up. What is this? - Who is it? Open up. Stop there. Come on, tell me. Your daughter is here. As promised, we have brought your daughter. You and your daughter can live happily if you disclose the location of the treasure. No, I don't want to commit this sin. Then we will kill your daughter in front of you. Come on, tell me. - Answer him. Or else, you won't see your daughter ever again. No, please don't kill my daughter. I will tell you. If you look under the big rock at the south side of the holy pond, you will find the treasure. Very good. Dear! Open it. Open it! - Open! Who are you? I didn't get you. I am the father of Sister Sophia. Please go fast. Go and catch him, quickly. Or else, he may escape. Go and catch that wretched man. Quickly! Don't let them escape. They might jump into the river. Driver, take us to the police station. Who are you? I didn't get you. Who am I? I am CID Officer, Sekharan. The death of Mr. Smith's brother was a suspicious affair. So, you were disguised as the boatman since then. Yes, we were able to capture the culprit with your assistance. So, shall we take her corpse? Come. What about sister's corpse? It is inside Mr. Smith's bungalow. The motive behind her murder was the transportation of the treasure. And since he did not disclose the location of the treasure Mr. Smith killed his own brother, Alexander and imprisoned his manager, Thomas. Right? - Yes. The golden deity found near the lake was also a part of it. - Yes. The treasure that Mr. Alexander found first could be a part of it. Mr. Alexander and his manager must have thought that giving the remaining treasure to the villagers was the right thing to do. They would have shared their plan with Mr. Smith. Correct. Smith disagreed with them, and that is what resulted in the murder. The death of the servant intensified your doubts on Smith. Yes. The scary ghost, who killed the villagers, and his claim that he was the owner of the plot including the temple were mere tricks to keep the treasure out of other's hands. You did something impossible. The treasure will go to the rightful heirs. We will leave then. - Good luck. We are short of words to express our gratitude. We wish you could participate in the ritual which follows the consecration of the deity. Dear villagers. Your triumph has made us happy. But on the altar of your triumph the lives of two of our most dearest friends had to be sacrificed. One of them, Raghavan, who was my favourite student. The other one, our dearest sister, Sophia. Even if we leave this place the souls of those two beautiful human beings will stay here forever. Villagers, goodbye. 'Salutations.'
