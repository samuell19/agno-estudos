Tell me how long can I be alone? - Okay, I'm not reading the book. - I do not. That book, take it when we go. We came here to learn, didn't we? - We are not here to learn. - So...? - Mr. Chattopadhyay... - I am not Chattopadhyay. Are you Romeo then? Are you Juliet then? Please... go! - I'm pulling your hair. - I'm pulling too. Where did you get these qualities? From my dad. Where did you learn not to use them? From my mother. is it? There's the book, go get it. - you go. - He hears. No, he's asleep. - Take the book. - You take it. You threw it away. Okay, I'll take it. Alka, listen to me. Brother... what does the first line mean? Brother, can I tell you the meaning of the second line? Fool, do you study in school or what do you do? - I'm studying now. - What did you say in class? - Twentieth. - You should be ashamed. Do you want to be a jobless person like me when you grow up? If you don’t take first place next time, I won’t put you down. Do you want to be big? - I want to be. - Then study hard. But you said earlier about making money. I used to say that, but now I do not say that. An ignorant person is useless. He can get nothing good. Mom, why did you drop me off at eighth grade? Did you forget, son? Your father died at that time. Do you not believe in God? Everything will be fine. - Who are you? - A child of the Creator. Treat me as your brother. I do not want to die on the road. Take me to a doctor. Okay, let's go. The country is now independent. Do all doctors take money? Who are you I, too, am a creation of the One who created you. Let's go. Where did you get these books? Laughs when asked the answer... I steal them. Stealing? I think stealing is wrong. But then I think ignorance is worse than that, right? What did the exams do? M. that. When I was done, I realized that I had not learned anything. The real study begins later. Man's needs...? Hunger torments man from within. I'm a bookworm. I manage... ... by reading a little and teaching a little. Friend... Do you teach me? what? These books... more books... Why is that? Why are you reading? To drive away darkness. - Darkness here? - Yes. From now... Friend, even you have that pain. - Are you teaching me? - But I have no place to stay. I have a house. My money might say I'm an idiot. I can fulfill all your needs. Suppose you met a friend. OK. Look at him too. Brother's time is 12.30. Are you crazy to read so much? Sleep now. Wait... I'll go to sleep. I'm not even hearing your word. Now, go to sleep. Mom is always sick. Do not be like me. Alka, you have no right to tear up that ticket. Even 1000 rupee notes can be torn. Thousand rupee notes? See here. This is ill-gotten money, isn't it? I will not submit to my friends. If you want me you have to change. Look, what a beautiful flower! Grab it. I'm not crazy. Is this how much you love me? Do you want to be hurt to show your love? Get out of here. Crazy! Is that a beard or a thorn bush? Why don't you shave? My exam is near. I think about it. You tell me about my shave. why? - It hurts him. - Then why study regularly? If I don't get first place in university... ... you know Dad will not send me abroad. Abroad? Sometimes I think you're good at failing. Why is that? Then you can't get away from me. Alka why don't you understand it's a two year separation... ... is it a hindrance to our love? We have another age. Let's see how we can live without each other. You too can be free for 2 years and I will be too. Then I can see the world, and you can understand life. And if our love does not perish... ... then we can get married. What an outdated way of thinking. What does that mean? If you want, I can get engaged. But is not our love stronger than such bonds? Trust me, no one can break it. Here or there... ... if it does not happen... .... Wouldn't it be better if we knew about this in advance? I'm really talking like an idiot. And you do not take it too seriously. Now see how Mr. Chattopadhyay picks a flower for you. see. one two Three. If he leaves the country, will he come back? Do not be discouraged. Two years flies fast. This is your vacation. Let's go to Ooty. You will like it. Ooty is a beautiful place. A little less. This pain came along the way. Both sides aside, I'm going to massage. Please do not worry. No, please do not need. I do not silently watch as someone next to me is in pain. Please lie on your back. all right. You have magic in your hand, are you a doctor? No. My mom always has headaches, I... You sing well. My mother often sings in the evenings so I sometimes mumble too. This often happens to him while traveling. - Where are you going? - To Ooty. - We'll go there too. - Really? - We can go together. - Indeed. Yes, we can unite. "This fantasy world is so sweet" "I sleep under the shadow of happy dreams" "There will be no conflict between hearts" "Then don't worry about failures and successes" How long can I be alone? - Give it to me. - who is he? - Give it to me. - Tell me who he is. I mean, give it a go. - I do not think...? - You should not do that. - Where are you going? - Leave me alone. If not, I will stone this. Strike. Dad is inside. Sit down... all right. Dishonesty, flowing in the blood of men. Our times are very different. Every young man was ready to sacrifice his life for the nation. Where do you find people like that now? Now for the money, there is a passion. There is a lot of lying, fraud and black money making. The fault lies in education. Only lazy people are born from it. That's why I went to Alka's education... are you leaving? Welcome. Yes. pardon me. Thank you. You did not ask me, how am I now? That stone is too small. You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh? - You're good at thinking now. - Suppose I die from it? - It will get better. - Do you regret it? - about what? - My death. So you die. This mountain is also isolated. If you love someone...? He will have to go back. No, you can't go back after coming this far. You feel bad about not getting what you want. But you... get it quickly. - What is it? - A job, my child. Your luck will shine. Please listen to me, my child. This noble soul never lies. The moon is in the eighth house. And the scar on your forehead... You will not receive a penny from me. No money. But I will never forget you. And you will never forget me. - Do you sell your beard? - what? - Mustache...? - what? - This robe too? - what? 100 rupees. 200, 300 rupees. Has he gone abroad? He studies a lot. - Who? - White, long ears... The young man with the brown hair, who owns that book. Do you look at the hand? I read the eyes. Eyes? The past, present and future are written in one's eyes. Won't you give me the money? Look into my eyes. A handsome, young man in a land across seven oceans. What's your name, young man? answer me. Who is this girl with you? The Lord. Withdraw your money. God's people have no desire for money. But you did not say anything. What to do knowing? You will feel sorry. No, tell me. Then listen. Do you know what the legendary sage Durvasa told Shakuntala? what? To him, you will forget. Glory be to the Lord. I have to go today. It's such a long and dangerous road. And your father is not well. How do we both get there? Then, I will go alone. Look, how stubborn she is. Why did you suddenly think of going to the temple today? I have to go, Dad. I hope your wishes come true there too. Really? What do you want to pray for? Something... Raghuveer is there, go with him. May the Buddha bless you son. Aren't you going in? Miss Alka, you better not go. Why is that? I hope you pray for something that does not happen. Aren't you praying for something too? If I pray too, I do not know whose prayers God hears. It could be yours or mine. If he obeys me, yours may not happen. Why do you worry about God? He can fulfill the desires of everyone. Come on. I never thought you were such a good person. When I hear you say this I feel... ... tear the moon and place it on your forehead. Give you its brilliance. - Do you want to go for a walk? - No, I want to sleep. - Sleep? - Yes. Please stop. I feel dizzy. Then, sit down. Look, there are so many beautiful flowers! Wouldn't it be nice if you could wear them? What are you doing here? Wait! Come back, or I'll go. I can not bear to see this. It has a red flower and a white flower. What should I take? Please do not fall. Even if I fall, so what? Do you at least remember me? watch out. Alka, is anyone around? Help... help! Help! - No one here. - Is there a rope? No, how long can you stay this way? Not much time. My hands are loose. Can you catch this? Alka If something happens to me... No, nothing will happen to you. Please do not talk like that. - Listen to me... - No. You can come here. I thought you could not escape. If you are by my side I will not be harmed. Can't you save me from falling every day? What are you saying? I am already engaged. It is better to forget everything that happened today. I heard you're sick. I wanted to see you before I left. Alka, if I do not receive a letter from you in a few days... ...I come back. It is your love that warms my heart in this cold region. Or this heart will stop for a long time. Write to me soon. - Yours sincerely, Nand. Your wish has come true. But I'll never forget you, Alka. And I can not go wrong as long as your love is in my heart. You have changed me so much that I do not even know myself. If a cave had been dark for 10,000 years... If we get a little lamp there... Will the darkness soon fade? Darkness has not existed for 10,000 years. That is why it will take time to dispel the darkness. Similarly, when we begin to think and argue... Those habits are undergoing a transition. What is migration? That means habits change. Brother you... - When did you start reading? - Brother, I... It was only recently that she began to read. But I promised him I would never tell anyone. I do not know why she is so restrained about it. How are you? I got a job as a newspaper sub-editor. That's big news. - Are you sad? - No, how are you, Mom? Your mother's condition was extremely serious. Recently, I took her to the hospital because she was in severe pain. The X-ray report showed that she had a tumor on her head. Operation was the only solution because it was too much. But I thought I should wait for you. Because her life is in danger. I'm sorry you gave me bad news like this when you arrived... Are you back, son? I doubt I will survive. You're getting better, Mom. I never intended to be bad to anyone. Then I will know what wrongs I will be punished for. Maybe, for the wrong things I did. do not say that. my goodness! - Hello, sir. - Welcome. - How are you, Makanlal? - I am fine. Do you like this work? What am I hiding from you? You gave me a new life. - Let's go. Time is up. - Where? Make a fuss over a new movie. It pays us well. Distributors pay a very good price. We can make a movie a success or a failure. This business is better than selling tickets. We can watch the film for free, get into fights and get paid. - We will definitely use force. - Everyone is scared... So ready to give money. And the best time is the premiere. Inviting big stars, inviting people like us. Aren't your actions the cause of your happiness and sorrow? I can not do wrong as long as your love is in my heart. Listen to this! This work has to be stopped from today. - Why is that? - what are you saying? what is the matter? Come on guys, let's go. Be smart! You are very tired, so rest. We will listen to your joke later. Now is the time to go to work. Let's go. If they get into a fight, hit them. I must not let them ruin my premiere. Someone stabbed him. There was a commotion. Everyone is here. Now close the door. What happened? - He's in the hospital. - His life is in danger. Come with me. do not! You gave me a new life. I'll give it back today. I want to get out of this business that ruined his life. Is anyone coming with me? - Mr. Desai? - Yes. Me, can I talk to you for a bit? Get in. Do you know this, Mr. Attorney? Here, take your Rs.5,000. I am... Then this too must have been a new tactic. It is a ploy to get rich through illicit means. This is a ploy by a rich man to become a beggar. I made a mistake the first time I stole your bag. So I thought I'd entrust you and reform myself. I am guilty. And I am ready to face any punishment. Sit down. Say nothing more? If you listen, I will tell. That day I stole your 5000 rupees and ran away. That's all I have to say. After hearing all this, do you think I will hand you over to the police? I really want to appreciate you. God willing, may your wish be successful. You go. Come on, buy these. One rupee. Buy this, for 2 rupees each. This is 25 rupees. 2 rupees each. This is 2 rupees. for sale... - 50 paise. - Give me 25 paise. For 25 paise...? Are these stolen goods...? Massage my shoulder. I ask you to give me a massage. I'm in trouble too. Even my ancestors did not choose such a thing. - I earned 20 rupees. and you? - Nothing. No shopkeeper will let you sell in front of your shop. There is also the police. And consumers think we're thieves. - This job is not cheap. - Not respectable. - Not happy. - No money. There is only difficulty. Fools. We are all idiots. Even the scriptures say... That work and religion should not be abandoned. Are we crazy when we find 100 rupees, do this and earn 2 rupees. We who made money with a little effort... ... tells you to work hard all day. Although I eat dry bread, I want a good meal. This job is useless. I like the old business. - Me too. - And so do I. - Prefer it. - Ganesh is right. - Raghuveer is crazy. - We were misled by him. - We'll not do this again. - Yes, we do not. We are not doing this work. Until now I thought... That we were engaged in illegal employment because we had nothing else to do. But now... If we have a choice but we want to continue... That means we are bad people. There is no question of good and bad. Both professions. You say, sell these items for 4 annas for 6 annas. Isn’t it appropriate to make a profit this way? Is it a crime to sell a Rs. 1.50 ticket for Rs. 2? If you had someone you loved so much in your home... Will you ask me this question? - I have no one. - You have a conscience. What does that mean? He has sold it. Shut up! - Keep your mouth shut. - Do you want to hit? You have the right to choose. I can not force anyone. But think of our past and our present. And think about what might happen to us in the future. Do we continue to hide our profession from our family? Do we want our children to be called street children? Aren't they the children of honest and respectful parents? Do we keep running when the police come? I pray to God not to give us such material comforts. Just giving us a meal... ... to cultivate a good heart and respect. Respect... ask more. You will get a lot of respect. The police chase us like dogs. Compare his wise words with the money you earn. Did we get the right meal? Did we earn any respect? We only received harassment and insults. I have seen many respectable people. Owners of bungalows, cars, gold coins. So why don't I have those things too? Why should I not earn when I can? The one who has earned billions can show that he is a great man. When we earn millions, so can we. I ask why we only danced to his tune? After all, he is in this situation today because of us. We were in his arms. Or what can he do alone? If there is a fool, you can go with him. Those who are with me can come this way. Ganesh was right that you are my hands. Without hands a body is useless. But keep in mind that even the hands are useless without a body. Come here tomorrow at 10 am to meet those who are with me. No one has come. Buy 4 tickets each, right? OK. Go ahead, get there. But be careful. Raghuveer... What does he think? - What do we do? - I'm leaving. Rs.1.50 tickets for Rs.2. give me. how many? - 50 tickets. - what? Here is the money for your wife and children. I think the film is good. Create something that will interfere with the film at the premiere. Break the film. I'll be there soon. Be careful. The songbook of the movie 'Talak', Price Anna Two. After all, we owe a lot to that man. We betrayed him. We cannot face him. How do we get ahead of him? Everyone is there. What are you doing? Shut up and see what happens there. Are you still here? The show is about to begin. Come forward. Why are you still there? Come with me. The songbook for the movie 'Talak', Price Two Anna. Songbook, price two anna. Do you want to make money? I want to earn hard. I know your strategy. But try to understand why I am here. I don't care if you go to hell. But I will not let any of these people in. we will see. You idiots! He is not a tiger that eats you. I am not going. Songbook, price two anna. Do you want to fight? Maybe you've forgotten that you fought with me once before. Raghuveer, get out of here. Or face dire consequences. Songbook, price two anna. Poor man. Then you are brave. Want more? Why are you hitting him? Sir, he was harassing me. Are you harassing me again? Going or beating a little more? Do as you please. But these two hands do not rise to attack anyone. But I have a hundred more hands. I have to see how long they don't save me. I'm going to hit you again. We rent 50 shops. - 50 shops. - Yes. I want to open the largest store in Mumbai for the poor. That's great. Everything here is sold at a low price. The complex is called "Safed Bazaar". "Safed Bazaar" - Is everything alright? - Yes, by the grace of God. Everything is going well. - Hello, boss. - How are you, Govind? Is everything alright? Welcome. How are you? Hello, brother Raghu. - Brother Raghu. - How are you? - Welcome. - good day. Extend your umbrella, or you may catch a cold. I'll take you to the taxi stand. There is no bus. Come on. I think we had to walk. Where are you going Near your home. Shall we go I live here. Really, should I go now? - Aren't you coming in? - I'm late. I'm not alone, my mother and sister are here. Okay, let's go. Mom, she's Alka. She also lives nearby. I met her on the road. She came to see you. No... Come here. - I'm wet. - Never mind, come here. my goodness! It's cold. You need to change clothes. - I'll go home. - Go with her... The truth never lies. Yes, come on. Change your clothes or you will get pneumonia. The girl is beautiful. Mom, I also have the flu. - Do those clothes fit? - Yes. I'll wash this wet cloth. You come later and take them. I will see you again. I'm coming to see you somehow. Is that right? You came with my brother. For the first time today I saw my brother very happy. Come on. I forgot to bring an umbrella. Is this not enough? Alka, Nand, how are you now? I have not received any letter from him for 3 months. I, I do not know why you say this. But an astrologer in Ooty said. what? what? what is wrong? The cheater, cheated then. I swear it wasn't me then. - what are you talking about? - Astrologer. - Did I say it was you? - Didn't you say? Oh! Baby, look into my eyes. Remember that day... I'm leaving now. Aren't you coming in? I'm late. I am not alone, living with my parents. Come on. Everyone is here at this time. Mom... Dad, there's someone to meet you. Raghuveer! You disappeared from Ooty. And you promised to meet us in Mumbai. Looks like you're completely different. - Let him in. - Yes... Come in. - Why are you so wet? - There was no taxi or bus. - Change clothes immediately. - you too... I am... You may have a cold or pneumonia. Do you want to die? God forbid, he came home for the first time. You can't go until you eat something. Alka, give me my clothes. - Well... - Go. just wait. Read this article first. You always complained that you did not receive a letter. - Was it sent by Nand? - Who else is writing to you? Why, what's wrong? I write long articles every day. But he answers only 3 months later. Listen to what he has to say. Alka I don't even have time to die. I will write later. He must have been busy. He has been busy, but not with learning. - Stop talking like that. - Can't I say that? Haven’t I been waiting two years? I'm an adult now, so I can understand everything. You can't even understand that... ... Being with these wet clothes will make you both catch the common cold. - Please come. - Go. Next Sunday we will go with him too. Yes, why not? - Raghuveer. - Yes? We are going to visit Kamala Caves. You're coming too, aren't you? I think I... No holidays on Sundays? - Please come. - Good. Then you have changed. There is as much love in these sculptures as we can see. I wish I was a stone statue too. At least I could have loved it like this every day. Is Nand's shadow still falling on us? Or has my shadow fallen between Nand and you? Yes, that is also true. But I stayed away, Alka. However, your shadow is not like that. But you have to make a decision. I still can not believe it. He must have adapted to that country. But such a bright young man to be so different... Tell her about it to get to know her. Why, what? A friend of Nand sent a message from London. - What about another girl? - Did you hear that? What else? He failed the exams. Exams failed...? Even if you say he's married, I believe. He does not study in London, he has fun. - He must have met an English girl. - Now, stop talking nonsense. What I say is nonsense. Whatever he does is right. Mom, I got engaged to Nand because I thought he was good. But now if he changes I have nothing to do. That's enough. What if he fails a thousand times? If he doesn't care about me then why should I care about him. You, now I'm not engaged Nand. That's why I want you to forget me. Hurry Up. Brother! I want earrings, anklets, sandals for mom. OK! I'll get everything. True, I came to pick up my clothes. Read it and then post it. I will post it before this letter is removed. Here are your clothes... where are you brother? Where did he go? - I'll tell her. - No, I will say. - I will tell. - Look, I told you... - I told you I would tell him. - Oh. father! Look, she's so happy. do you know...? I don't want to know anything right now. I always say he's a good boy, but you hurt his feelings from time to time. - I did not do that to him. - Really? Today it is very difficult to find good young people. If you find someone, take care of them. He needs to change but adopt. Dad, he's talking to you in the evening. He's coming here... tonight... to talk to Dad. Really? He has already met your father. He's coming here tomorrow to meet you. What time did he arrive? About half an hour ago. He is impatient anyway. He has become more handsome. He speaks a lot of English. - Who is that? - Nand! Did you know that Nand is back? Who were you talking about? Is Nand back? Go back, Raghu. Do not talk to Dad today. - Why is that? - Do not ask questions. What are you saying? Nand is back. So everything has changed. That means I... I know nothing. I can not say a word. Don't ask me anything now. Go, Raghu! Please forgive me. I came and went yesterday. This is for you. you and me... Can we go out for a bit? We have to be apart for two years to test our love. Remember what I said then? How's the test, Alka, did you pass or not? This ring is still intact. You do not have the permission required to post. You can throw it away anytime you like. Is this what you came to say two years later? What did you expect from me? Alka, if you want to, love someone else. But I can not live without you, let me stay at your feet. - Why so angry? - Don't be silly. I'm not a fool. I want to know who Raghuveer is. - Why are you asking about that? - I do not know. I have a right to ask. Didn't you have another girlfriend? That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there. I am not a virtuous woman who will always forgive you. it's clear. Couldn't you have told me you were in love with another man? So as not to disappoint me. Do not hold me fully responsible. I have been waiting for you for two years. I did not allow another man to come near me. You forgot that my parents and friends also live here. - They send me letters. - They're lying to you. Is it a lie that he went to Ooty with Raghuveer? No matter how many letters I write, you do not reply. That is a lie. It is true that Raghuveer loved me. It is also true that I rejected him. That's for you, Nand. I did so until I had in my heart that you were mine. But then, I thought you were not mine. I was yours as long as you were mine. You wrote daily, then once a week, then once a month. Later, it even stopped. "My own Alka", "My Alka" finally just became "Alka". "Your own Nand", "Your Nand", finally became just "Nand". I'm not blind. You have failed. Nand, who was always at the top of the university, failed. Nand, who was academically brilliant, failed. Is that you? Obviously, I had to fail. As I chose the books, your treachery appeared before me. I was a man who worked hard day and night. I could not find sleep or peace because there was no one for me. Waiting for a day is like waiting a year. Such an Alka... It makes me cringe when I think that Alka is like that. Now Raghuveer is in love with Magodiku. Do not insult that noble person like that. It's not his fault. He suffered a lot because of me. Even if you meet him, you will still love him. Is it true that you love him? You said you wanted to be free for 2 years. And I want to be the same way, right? Alka I had to do an investigation today to hear what you just said. Why did you have to do that? You are the one who said that our love is immature. I was going to tell you today... What we thought was love we both didn’t have. So do we both fail this exam? Yes, for something better. When will you introduce me... ... to that noble soul who snatched my alka from me? First of all, who snatched my Nand from me? She is a French girl. He comes to teach me French. The French language is like love. Really? Will you give her this gift for me? On one condition. Hit this flower on Raghuveer's collar for me. - He's wearing a coat, isn't he? - No, he's wearing a shirt and a jacket. - Is he a patriot? - Yes. My mother will be happy to know that your father liked it. Sorry, is your name Raghuveer? Yes. This is your arrest warrant. You have been accused of running a gang. Deploying them in riots. You make money illegally. Directing them to do the same. I'm sure you're wrong. Alka Today is the luckiest day of my life. But now if you do not trust me... ... Tonight will be the most unfortunate night of my life. But the warrant is in your name. That is untrue. While that is true, it is no longer so. Really? Does a man who walks in a bad way have no right to be a good man? Have you ever made that mistake? Trust me, Alka, I gave them up. I changed. Now I have not the slightest trace of sin. They can't prove anything. You must have used that money to get this house and other amenities. - Alka, I did not. - You should have told me earlier. The look is so deceptive. Can't you see mom? Mother! The doctor told me not to move. What's the matter mom? This... Is this true son? No, Mom. No. Are you lying to mom? Mom, this is not true. - This is true, isn't it? - That's not true. That's a real mom. But it's less true, more false. I have already been forgiven of my sins. Take care of mom. - I'll come with the doctor. - What's the matter mom? Son... Son... if something happens to me... Then take care of my daughter. Mother. Brother. Brother. Brother. Brother. Stop the jeep Mother... Brother. Why is mom's face covered? Your brother killed your mother. No brother... leave me alone. Don't go... Don't go. It's too late. Nothing can be done right now. Brother. - My mother is gone. - Enough, my sister. enough. Welcome! Great man! I have been waiting for you for a long time. - Please come. - Thank you. You are in the news these days. You are a very famous person. I came to get your signature. Sign here. Sign? what is this? I'm not going to give you any answers. But if you feel that I have done something for you in life... ... then do this. Sign without question. Do you think that I'm going to snatch your wealth? Are you saying that you are a decent and respectable man? Yes! Are You In The Market For a Car Loan? I was seduced and cheated for money. I took advantage of my poverty. Clearly state the person responsible for this. Raghuveer. - He's lying. - That's a lie. And I was not the only victim. He caught up with many people who were suffering from poverty. He lured them into money and abused them. Today he appears sublime and deceives us. He criminalizes the poor like us and fills his property. Do you admit that you are still cheating for Raghuveer? Yes. - Will he pay you then? - Yes. Who are you marketing fraudulently for? - For Raghuveer. - For Raghuveer. - For Raghuveer. - For Raghuveer. Shut up! You were once a bus conductor, weren't you? Yes. Were you kicked out of there? Yes. Because you hit a man? Yes. Then, within a year, you started earning fifteen, twenty thousand a month, right? Yes. Have you ever paid income tax on it? - No. - why not? Because of that ill-gotten gains. My client does not want to defend himself in this case. So he did not cooperate with me at all. In fact, he has pleaded guilty in court. Isn't his honesty a good reason... ... to have the court release him. Isn't that a reason not to inflict severe punishment? Someone who seduces innocent poor people and commits a crime... Who pushes others to become millionaires... How can the court relax such a man? He is a wolf in sheep's clothing. An evil heart is hidden under the white cloth. A venomous snake that looks like a beautiful person. Look at the evil that lurks beneath the face of goodness. A shopping mall was opened with ill-gotten money. A demon who pretends to be God to deceive others. A ridiculous ascetic, a pseudo-aristocrat. An evil man who sings the name of the Lord. Should he be given a lenient sentence? A criminal pleading guilty without defending himself. But because of this he does not claim any kind of mercy. The man who has cheated the law so far... ... suddenly decided to be polite. Committing a thousand crimes and then trying to pretend to be reformed. The man who sucks our blood all the time... ... is suddenly here today to donate his blood to us. If such a man is not severely punished by the court... ... who else is being punished? Before hearing the verdict, does the defendant have anything to say? Sit down. Brother! No mom now. I only have you. Truth do you want your brother to lie... ... thereby increasing the burden of his sin. No, brother. Raghu, please excuse me. You are not a criminal in the eyes of everyone here. It is an insult to the judiciary to speak like this in court. You do not know the whole truth. There is a proper way to say whatever you want. - Say something, for me. - Take her. At least say something for the good of everyone here. - What is this impartiality? - Let him talk for a minute. Just a minute. - Say something, Raghuveer. - Say something. Do not let that evil Ganesh win. We need to save you for us. What will happen to us if you go to jail? - Your work is still incomplete. - Please say something. Is this how you should behave in court? You guys send it all out. Does the accused have anything to say on his behalf? Good! Then the court decision can be heard now. Lord, please listen to me before making a decision. I can challenge that this case goes further. I have some evidence that can make a difference. Which side are you talking about? I am the new lawyer for the defendant. Suppose one of you is trapped while rescuing Raghuveer. - Don't worry about us. - Save Raghuveer, sir. Yes, save Raghuveer. We are all ready to fight. But save Raghuveer. Were you an employee under Raghuveer? Yes, I work under him. You must meet him every day, right? - Yes. - You, where do you meet him? We have a tipping point. Does your boss pay the rent? Yes. If I prove that you have been paying rent for the last 6 months... And what if Raghu hasn't even been there since then? Don't worry. Maybe you met him at his house, right? Yes, I meet him at his house. You lied a little, didn't you? Yes, I lied. Lying even after being sworn in here. However... you definitely need to know his address, right? - Yes, it's on Marine Drive. - Marine Drive? Did you forget the name of that building? On which floor, on the third? - Yes, on the third floor. - Third or second? - The third one. - Think again. Yes, maybe a second. I have a sari shop. What did you do before that? Illegal sale. - Before that? - Illegal sale. - Even before that? - Illegal sale. Before you met Raghuveer, were you involved in illicit sales? I gave Raghuveer the idea of ​​selling illegally. This is a family business. Why did you leave your traditional profession? Raghuveer asked me to get out of it and instead bought me a sari shop. If he is punished I will have to go back to my profession. I was involved in illicit sales. According to the complaint, Raghuveer gave money to innocent people... ... that motivates them to commit criminal activities. Not innocent... I was a thief before I met Raghuveer. I did illegal work. I have become polite and respectful because of Raghuveer. I was also involved in illicit trading and hit the "pick pocket" before. I have a watch shop today because of Raghuveer. I also engaged in illicit trade with Raghuveer. But before that I was a gambler. Because of Raghuveer I have become an honest man today. My whole life is a beggar in disguise. Raghuveer made me a respectable man. I used to be very good at using knives in conflicts. But today I have become a better man because of Raghuveer. I was also involved in illicit trade. Before that I was selling counterfeit liquor. But because of Raghuveer I got rid of both. If Raghuveer is sentenced to one year in prison... ... I should be sentenced to a thousand years in prison. Raghuveer made me a good man. Raghuveer made me a good man. The words of the plaintiff's lawyer still resonate in my ears. He incites innocent people to commit crimes. Raghuveer says, like a poisonous snake. He is the one who made all these people into this situation. What a grave sin he has committed! He did not allow thieves to be thieves. Or gamblers are just like gamblers. He was a beggar, an alcoholic and... ... completely changed the lives of others. He has made them respectable and honest people. He has made all these mistakes. File lawsuits, make 50 more lawsuits. They may even be involved in illicit marketing. What right do they have to pretend to be innocent here? Bring them to the witness box too. Do you need evidence against them? Well, they have already given it up. If they were all sentenced to five or six years in prison... ... when they are released from prison... By your grace they have to go down the wrong path again. Yes, I have to go to hell. This world is a place where Christ was crucified... Gandhi was shot. If uneducated people embrace the good in such a world... ... it should be considered a miracle. And they are not the only ones who stray from the right path. They also help others. They bring light into the paths of others. They become symbols of sacrifice. How many people in life have any supreme principles? And how many people like Raghuveer follow them? Every word of defense is a fraud. It is beyond the real purpose. It's just trying to evoke sympathy. Therefore, we ignore the crime of the accused... ... and turn it off. If we start looking at criminals that way... ... why do we need the law, the courts, the police and the government. Every immoral person will do little good and escape punishment. When the law wanted to arrest him... ... he will raise the argument we have heard. This is like blindfolding justice... ... the life, position and name of the accused are invisible. And look only at the crime committed. And give the necessary punishment. Justice is not blindfolded... ... to weigh it and make a decision. It weighs good and bad. A crime is a crime. It cannot be approved. Even if the person is hidden under the guise of goodness. If he is in hiding, he should be arrested. But if not bad, why punish him? Illegal marketing person is a criminal... ... even though he did a lot of good things later. We are not here to judge the noble deeds. He has been arrested for his crimes. He has been indicted for his crimes. Punishment is for what is done. We do not care about his goodness. What did we get by speaking the truth? We could have been arrested for cheating. We now show the law the consequences of punishing decent people. Anger will be unleashed in the city. All the good people like us have been arrested. Who honestly pleaded guilty. Did you think the court would accept you as honest? Did you come here to be a martyr? Did you get rid of the crime by speaking the truth? He could have escaped from the law in hiding forever. The law that touched me, could have arrested you someday. - Nobody called you to court. - We came to save you. Why, was he going to hang me? Did you think of yourself as an angel of grace? No, my friends. You were taken to court for another reason. The flames of your conscience were burning. That is what motivated you to speak the truth. It caused you to move away from illicit marketing and do other jobs. I would say that shopping mall is not necessary. I do not mind if thousands of such shopping malls catch fire. What we need is that fire that is slowly becoming a flame. The flames that were supposed to light up our lives. On the edge of darkness and the excitement of your anger... ... Do not let that fire go out, friends. Do not let this little cell interfere with our firm intentions. This punishment is given to strengthen us, not to make us cowards. You came to admit guilt like brave men. Show that you come back as human beings even after being released. This is a popular Hindi movie released in 1960.
