Good morning, teacher. Sobradinho, Bahia, represents an important milestone in the regeneration of the Northeast. Here, a huge dam is being constructed that will leave seven municipalities under water, and this single act will contribute more than anything else to regulating the Sao Francisco River. Relocating the population is a very thorough and considered process. Having received fair compensation through the social services, those displaced will find new homes built especially for them. By leaving their old homes they will benefit hundreds of municipalities in states throughout Brazil. It's time to create a new landscape for the latest generation to inhabit the Sao Francisco river. It's time to show a way forward to those who experienced first hand the suffering caused by the long droughts. "That was when I realized we had been tricked. There was no electricity and the water wasn't fit to drink. The house was very small. We had lost all of our land. My brothers and sisters gave up hope and left. I lost track of them and never saw them again." Rebecca, tell me: who are you? Who is your character? I am a settler. My family recently arrived here in Serra do Ramalho. Are you happy? No. Close your eyes. Think of a time when somebody deceived you. Someone promised you something very important, very precious to you, Rebecca. You trusted them, but they let you down. Bring that feeling to the text. THE CITY OF THE FUTURE I showed that film I told you about. It was great showing how people arrived here in Serra... Took me 3 years to get this material from the Hydro-Electric Company. Took ages. You never wanted to watch it, right? What's in the past is in the past. Pretty soon no one will remember this story. I wish I had known you at that time, mom. Young, full of dreams... You have such a pretty smile, mom. How about you and Vanessa? You know I liked her better than anyone? When I saw Vanessa it was like I had something alive inside of me. I felt it under my skin... I'm really restless. I want everything all at once. I like that about you. You're intense too. Am I? - I like that. They say it's over five thousand years old, but they don't know for sure. I can't work out any of it. Looks like it’s moving, don't you think? Remember the first time we came here? You're not gonna let this confuse things, are you? No, I'm not. Let's get married? Are you crazy? I'm serious. Let’s get married? You're not afraid? Me, no. How about you? Yeah, I am. Entire families from five municipalities were forcibly relocated to allow for the construction of the Sobradinho Dam. Understandably, these families protested. Nobody likes leaving their own land, especially families, over twenty thousand of them. And they were dumped here, in the woodland. They were deceived into thinking they would be relocated to the Sao Francisco River since they were riverside people and had always lived there. But in reality they were dumped here, over 20 km from the Sao Francisco river. No access to health care, no technical help, and especially no social support. And there was a huge outcry, a great deal of heartache, with many families returning to where they had originally come from. One, two, three, four, five, six. Mark it with the right foot. One, two, three, four. Take your hat off, girls. Back, turn forward. Got it? Let’s go? Everybody to their positions! Come on, Baneza. I'm hitting play. Two... Three... One, two, three... One, two, three! Remember when you used to date Manu? Why do you bring that up now? Dunno... She was really pretty. Light-skinned girl, like, cute. I can’t understand why you broke up with her. Just didn't work out. What do you mean it didn't work out? A girl like that? You were crazy about her, man. In love, head over heels. With a girl like that, who wouldn't be? What about grandma’s surgery, mom? Have they scheduled it? Yes. Is it serious? No, it's not. What's there to eat? You want something? I’ll heat it up. You don't need to do that, I'm starving. "...and to think that Claudia did it on her own!..." "...alright, pale-face, come towards me please..." "...go get it..." "...went to the bathroom and came back wearing high heels with skirts so short that can’t even be called skirts, they're more like belts. Yeah, you know? It’s not respectful..." Where are you going? To meet some friends. Are you going to meet Gilmar? Yes. You know that this has to end sometime, right? "How can I forget the kiss you gave me" "Don't know if I'm supposed to forget or remember" "And a piece of you stayed with me" "And now I want to see you, to surrender" "How I want once more your lips to meet" "The way you do it is so sweet" "That's why I want your hands on me" "How I want the scent of love that's coming" "Bringing your body just to me" "How I want once more your lips to meet" "The way you do it is so sweet" "That's why I want your hands on me" "How I want the scent of love that's coming" "Bringing your body just to me" - Are you from Havana? - I am from Santiago, Cuba. It is the... the second city of the country. Do you miss your family? Very much. My family is everything to me. Let’s try to find the fetus' heartbeat. Is that the baby's heartbeat? No, this is still yours. We’re still looking for the baby's, okay? OK... - Just relax. This is the baby's heartbeat. It's alive! - Yes! I need to tell you something. Does it have to be now? I've missed you. It has to be now. Milla is pregnant. Who's the father? New baby in the family? HAPPY Supermarket There it is. But can you make anything out from this? Yes, you can. Now do you see it? Now I do. But it’s so tiny! Look, here’s the head, do you see? The spine being formed... Little feet, hands... and it’s 16 millimeters. - 16 millimeters or centimeters? - Really it's millimeters. It’s tiny, the size of a bean. Look, the image is zoomed in. - And these colored dots, what are they? - Blood circulation. Now they're going to measure the heart. You can hear the heartbeat. That’s its heart? It sounds like a train! It sounds like a whole railway in there! Is that it? - Yeah. Congratulations! That's wonderful! Let me give you a hug! Thanks! Pretty soon you'll have a nephew... This is the map of Bahia. Here's the capital, Salvador. This is the North, and here are the four towns that were flooded... And the queer, right, was on the plane, dying for a smoke. And there's this old man, freezing his ass off. And a guy would walk by, and the queer: "Hey man, give me a cigarette..." And the old man there, freezing and stuff... and the queer always walking by, "Hey man, give me a cigarette" "Hey, you, give me a cigarette..." And the old man there freezing. And then the man lost it with the queer, grabbed him, took him to a room, and bam, bam, fucked him in the arse. Then he came back... - Mike, change places. No, I’ll be quiet now. - Change places, you're disturbing me. - No, I’ve finished, I’ll be quiet. You'll be quiet somewhere else, Mike. Well, everyone, as we were saying... Is this child mine too? It’s mine, Gilmar's and yours. Let’s make a toast? To a beautiful child on its way and to these three crazies who are going to blow people’s minds in Serra do Ramalho! I'm off. God bless you, mother. So you aren't speaking to me either? You went too far, Milla. It’s my life. It’s nobody else's business. What's that supposed to mean, Milla? What the hell? Goddammit, you with Gilmar and Igor. Everyone's talking about our family. You care too much about what other people think. Of course I do. Remember when you let your hair grow? Everybody had something to say about it. Did you think about everyone then? - I did. But you didn't cut your hair. No, but I have my pride. I was never abused on the street. I think your hair is beautiful. This is really upsetting Mom. Dad doesn't come home any more. If I were you, I'd just leave. This is crazy, you're a child! Listen to me for once in your life, for the love of God! Again with this talk? Gilmar is the child's father, Milla is the mother. You are nothing in this story, nothing! Do you hear me? “Father” is whoever raises the child. Where is my father? Did he raise me, or was it you? There's no future in this - you don't work, and have no way of supporting yourself! What’s going on here? Raí, Jean! Raí! Jean! Enough! What is this? Are you crazy? Jean, how could you? What is happening here? It was because of you, teacher. He was badmouthing you and teacher Milla. Good morning. Can I leave my CV here? Thanks. That's it - there are no more vacancies. Have you heard people talk about gay cowboys? They don't exist. Are you sure? If they do, we’ll kill them. Was your family compensated? We weren't... compensated. We got a token gesture. Let me tell you about the compensations: The compensations... If you are in charge of demolishing a building, you should look for the owner. “What is this property or land worth?” But they did the opposite. Although it was during the dictatorship so no one could say anything. And so we went through tough times. So, they would come with no intention of finding out the value. They ignored the true value of the property. They'd say “your house is worth this much...” “it’s worth 10,000 cruzeiros, it’s worth 12...” And so on, right? Then you'd say: “But sir, that’s too low! My house is worth 20,000...” “No, it’s only worth twelve.” “Well, for 12 I'm not giving it up”, the owner would say, “I won’t sell for 12!” They would say: “Either sell or end up being drowned, because right here the water will be over 30 meters deep.” Then what? What choice did we have? That’s how we were treated. Check your information. Don't you care about the students? Yes, I do. That’s why I’ve taken this decision. Are you going to sack Gilmar as well? MILLA QUEER'S BITCH Let’s get out of here, Gilmar. Let's raise our child somewhere else. Go where, Milla? I don't know. I don't want to be thrown out of the place where we were born. That’s what happened to our parents. I'm tired of all this. I’ll take care of you. "Getting the cold shoulder hurts" "So many times you've asked me to stop trying so hard" "Now I've faced it and those days are long gone" "I've taken your advice" "Remember the cold shoulder that you gave this fool?" "I'm at the bar with my whisky and Red Bull" "Your coldness is chilling my whisky and Red Bull" "I'm living it up with my friends" "Your coldness is chilling my whisky and Red Bull" Leave that, Milla. I'm fine. Let me do that. Rest a little. Have you ever put a crib together? No, this is the first. Well, have you ever had a health care plan, funeral insurance? No, never. No. I've worked at Bom Jesus Funeral Home, in Serra do Ramalho for three years now. It offers health plans, and a whole range of medical assistance, opthalmologist, dentist, orthopedist and... clinical, pharmaceutical, and more. With a discount between 10% and 60%. It also covers... Funeral arrangements. So in the event that someone who's covered dies, it provides transport to move the body up to 100 km, cremation urn, veil, candles, and other things as well. It also contracts someone to spend the whole night at the funeral home, helping out, serving coffee, snacks, tea... I'll leave one of the company’s pamphlets with you. It explains everything in detail. That’s good. If we want to contact the company, to get the plan, it's all here, right? Exactly, the company's number is right there. Some plans are good, so when you die you look handsome, in a tie and all. Yes, and I... I think it’s great, because I'm paying for that, yes? So when the person dies, he's all ready - Have you ever seen a handsome corpse? - looking like he's going to a party! - Every corpse is ugly! I feel like eating graviola fruit. Just as well it’s not in season. It's only you who doesn’t like graviola. I don't know, it doesn't taste so good. What are you cooking? Sun-dried meat. Did you let it soak? I did that last night. Did the principal confirm your leave of absence? He did. Did he mention sacking you? No. Don't worry. Do you think my legs are swollen? No. Just need to keep massaging them. Have I put on a lot of weight? Just the belly. Is my butt sagging? It’s all firm. Have you been seeing anyone, Milla? Yes. Boy or girl? Boy and girl. Is that a problem? No. As long as it doesn't hurt Heitor... Good evening, good evening, Serra do Ramalho! This is Igor, we’re starting with our… Interactive Show! And I’ll be with you until 8pm, alright? The exact time is 6pm and two minutes! 'Vitor Furniture!' Today is Friday. It's the day for romance and going out with friends! Today there’s Halloween and also Rodeo, our main event!

Are you dedicating it to someone or do you just like it? It's a dedication. The person knows. "How can I forget the kiss you gave me" "Don't know if I'm supposed to forget or remember" "And a piece of you stayed with me" "And now I want to see you, to surrender" "How I want once more your lips to meet" "The way you do it is so sweet" "That's why I want your hands on me" "How I want the scent of love that's coming" "Bringing your body just for me" "How I want once more your lips to meet" "The way you do it is so sweet" "That's why I want your hands on me" "How I want the scent of love that's coming" "Bringing your body just for me..."

Kisses to all and until next time! You disappeared. It’s been really confusing for everyone. I'm afraid too. Gilmar is the best father I could choose for my son. But he’s not my husband. And how’s the baby? Heitor. How is Heitor? He’s well. He’s growing. You don't have to be a father if you don't want to. What if I still do? "Father" is whoever raises, and cares for the child. I know. Thanks. I’ve missed you, "life". Let’s get married? Aren't you afraid? Not anymore. He’s kicking! Igor. Can you feel it? Uhum.
