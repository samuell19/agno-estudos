(silence) (upbeat playful music) (dramatic horn music) - Em! Em! (muffled shouts) - Dorothy! Dorothy! - Come on, Toto, hurry! Toto, no! Toto, no. I shan't not. Whoa! Toto, we stopped. Where are we? (bright music) (cheers) (barks) - Welcome, sorceress, and thank you for crushing our enemy, the Witch of the East. Because of you, the people of Munckinland are free. - Sorceress? Crushed? But I wouldn't hurt anyone. - Maybe so, but your house did land on this witch. - [Dorothy] Oh, I didn't mean to. Wait, there aren't any witches in Kansas. - I've never heard of Kansas. (munchkins mumble) - That may be, but we have four, or rather had four here. Two good, and two bad. I'm the Good Witch of the North. - Ouch, I guess this isn't a dream. - Ow, ow. - Good Witch, my little dog and I are lost. We were in a terrible storm. We just wanna get home. (giggles) - Going home? That's a tough one. Too tough for me, I'm afraid. But I'm sure the Wizard of Oz can help you with that. - Where can I find this wizard? - Follow this path to the Emerald City. It's right in the center of our land, and that's where you'll find the Wizard. But before you go... There. Now you have my mark to protect you from danger. (barks) Oh, this is very good. These slippers should make your trip home that much easier. (barks) - Goodbye, thank you! Goodbye! - Remember, always keep to the path. - We will. Goodbye and thank you. - [Good Witch] No matter how narrow or how difficult it gets. (bouncy music) - Hello, Mr. Scarecrow. - And hello to you, little girl. (barks) Woof! - You can talk. But scarecrows aren't supposed to talk. - They're not? But I have a mouth, don't I? At least I think I do. Oh, think. No, I can't think. I don't have a brain in my head, just straw. - I'm going to the Emerald City to see the Wizard. He's going to help me get home. (growls) Would you like to come along? Maybe he can help you get a brain. - Oh boy, would I? Let's go! - Oh, you're walking on air. - Well, no wonder I wasn't getting anywhere. You see the stupid things I do with no brain? Could you please lift me off this pole? I'm very light. (giggles) Whoa, whoa. - Toto. I'm sorry, did he hurt you? - Well, I didn't feel a thing. I'm ready to go meet that lizard. - No, wizard. He's a wizard, not a lizard. - I gotta get that brain quick. Did I mention I do bird impressions? They used to fly around me and screech all day long. It got very annoying. So, how old are you, Dorothy? - I'm 12, how about you? - Well, as of today I'm two. - Two years old? - Oh my, no, I'm two days old. I was made day before yesterday. (thunder rolls) - Oh, it's going to rain soon. We better find a place to stay. - Good idea. We don't want to get soggy. (thunder rolls) - Hello? Anybody home? I wonder who lives here. - Good thing I never need to eat. (thunder rolls) - We'll just wait out the rain storm here. I'm sure the owner will be back soon. (whines) It came from over there. (whines) Over there! Did you make that noise? - I was chopping this tree when it started to rain, and I got stuck. - Oh, well, what can we do to un-stick you? - If it's not too much trouble, could you get an oil can from my cottage? Oh, oh. You saved my life. I never had to worry about rust when I was a man. - You were a man? - Oh yes, before the Wicked Witch of the West put a curse on me and turned my body into tin. I wouldn't have minded so much, except when she did she also took away my heart. Without a heart, I can't love anyone. - Don't worry. We're on our way to the Emerald City. The Wizard of Oz is going to help me find my way back to Kansas. - And I'm going to ask him for a brain. - And if the Wizard can do that, I'm sure he can give you a heart. - Well then, what are we waiting for? Let's go meet this wizard. (creaks) - Oh no, what'll we do now? - Stand back and watch me turn this tree into toothpicks. (growls) - That sounded close. - That wasn't a b-bird, that's for sure. I know b-birds, and that definitely was not a bird. - No need to worry, I have my axe. The Scarecrow is made of straw, so he can't get hurt. And you have the mark of the Good Witch's kiss on your forehead, Dorothy. - I know, but what about Toto? He doesn't have any protection. - He has all of us. We'll protect him. (growls) (barks) - Now, stop that! Now, what do you think you're going to do? Eat us? Well, you can wipe that idea right out of your bushy head. You must be a bully, thinking you can frighten any little thing that gets in your way. - You're right, I am a b-b-b-bully. I'm sorry. I just don't have the c-c-c-c-courage to hunt anything more than half my s-size. - Wait! If it's courage you need, then maybe you want to join us. - Join you? Where? - To see the Wizard of Oz in Emerald City. Oh, if anyone can help you find courage, I'll bet he can. (bright music) - Oh boy, this is great. Three days ago, I was just a pile of old straw. And now, I've already got three new friends. (barks) Oh, sorry, make that four. (growls) - It's the Caladaz! Run! - What are Caladaz? - They got the faces of tigers and the bodies of bears, and they're not afraid of man nor beast. Not even the K-K-King of the Beasts, me. (growls) - I'll cut us a way across. (growls) - There's not enough t-t-time! Quick, everyone get on my back. I'll try to j-j-jump us across. - Let her rip, horsey! - I'm not a horsey, I'm a-- (yells) - Yippee, let's saddle up again. - Oh no, it's the Caladaz! (growls) - Timber! (growls) - Hurry! (struggles) (growls) (cheers) There it is, it's the Emerald City. (bright gentle music) I guess the Wizard must be in there. - [Wizard] Who dares disturb the mighty Oz? - Hello, my name is-- - [Wizard] Silence! (barks) - No, I won't be silent. I'm lost and I wanna get back home. The Good Witch of the North said you could help me, and my friends have things they need, too. (thunder rolls) - Your mightyness, I need a brain. - And I, a heart. - And for me, your fullness, c-c-c-courage. - [Wizard] Your requests shall be granted! After you meet my demand. Rid the land of the Wicked Witch of the West. That is all. - Well, he seemed nice, although... Well, I was kind of expecting someone much taller. - What did he mean, get rid of? There's no path. How will we know where to find the Witch of the West? - Oh, we won't. She'll f-f-f-f-find us before we even get c-c-close to her. (gentle dramatic music) (winkies murmur) - That's right, come right this way. I have some lovely surprises in store for you. (laughs maniacally) (squeals) - Oh, where did those little men come from? - Oh, they're winkies, slaves of the Wicked Witch of the W-W-W-West. - If those little winkies hadn't run away, I'd have given them the old, the old-- - One-two. The old one-two. - Exactly, the old one-two. And maybe a three for good measure. - Silly fools can't do anything right. Well, I know those who can. Demons of the dark, obey my rules. Fly, my winged servants, and destroy these fools. (laughs maniacally) - Look, that must be the witch's castle. Oh, but what are those things in the air? (squeals) - Aw, nuts. It's the witch's w-w-winged monkeys! (squeals) - Whoa! - Run, Dorothy! Save yourself! (dramatic music) - So, your trusty tin man is now rusting on rocks. Your scary scarecrow has had his straw plucked and scattered. And your lily-livered lion is going without food until he's more willing to cooperate and be my slave. Now, what would you be willing to give me to spare your life, my little lost lamb? Hmm? What about those pretty silver slippers? (growls) Let go, let go of this umbrella, you vicious little furball! - No! Oh, Toto. Don't you hit my dog. - Now you're done it! I'm melting! - I didn't know. You were gonna hit my dog. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you. Really, I didn't. - Oh fine, you didn't mean it. I'm going to be a puddle of my former self and you didn't mean it. I hope you're happy! (cheers) - You have defeated the Wicked Witch and made us free men. What can we do to repay you? - I want my friends back. (snaps) - The winged monkeys are your servants now. You may make only three requests, so use them wisely. - Could they take us back to the Wizard? - I'm flying. I just learned how to walk two days ago, and I'm already flying. - Oh, thank you. - It was our pleasure to do a good deed this time, Dorothy. Remember, you now have only two requests. - We've answered the Wizard's request. Now, let's hope he keeps his promise. (thunder claps) The Wicked Witch is gone. I have her gold cap for proof. Now it's your turn to give us what we asked. - [Wizard] Leave at once! I will not honor the requests of fools. - Oh, come on, Dorothy. We better leave b-before he gets really m-m-mad. - We're not leaving. You're no wizard at all if you can't keep your promise. - You're right, Dorothy. I'm no wizard at all. - Oh no, the Wizard is a fake. - Your straw friend is right, Dorothy. I'm sorry I tricked you. - You're a real person like me? - Oh my, yes. I came here from Omaha, Nebraska, a long time ago. The people thought I was a wizard because I landed in a big balloon. They built me this city and I stayed here pretending I had magic. - Why didn't you leave a long time ago? - Oh, I was afraid of the two evil witches. They really do have magic, or rather did have. Follow me. (playful music) Now that you've gotten rid of the two evil witches, I don't have to be afraid to leave. With this balloon, Dorothy, you and I could fly right over this land and back home to Kansas. Just climb aboard. - What about my friends? You haven't given them what they asked. - Well, I told you I'm not really a wizard. Besides, they already have what they asked for. Alright, Dorothy, I'll do my best, but that's all I can do. Here you are, Scarecrow. These will help you see clearly and think clearly. - Well, how do I look? - Very distinguished. - And if you're giving extra thought to a problem, just slowly push the glasses up your nose. - Hey, where'd they go? Oh, that's better. - My dear Tin Woodman, you loved Dorothy enough to help her find her way to the Emerald City. This will remind you that you have a good and kind heart inside you. (playful music) And for the courage it took for you to guide this group on a most dangerous journey, I crown you, once again, King of all the Beasts of the Kingdom. - Aw shucks, it was nothing. - And now, Dorothy, I would like to grant your request. - No, Toto, come back! It's alright! - Hurry, Dorothy, before it's too late! I can't bring it back down! - But I can't leave my dog. - Then your only hope is with Glinda, the Good Witch of the South! - Goodbye, goodbye! - Good luck, Dorothy! I'm sorry I couldn't have done more. - Oh, now I'll never get home. I'll never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry again. - What about the winged monkeys? - That's a very wise decision. - Yes, they could fly me home. - This land is surrounded on all sides by a desert which even we cannot cross. I'm very sorry, but you have wasted your second request. - Ah, but you could fly us to Glinda's castle, could you not? - Yes, that we could do. - Well, this is my last request. I sure hope it works. - Remember, Dorothy. Even if Glinda can't help you, you can always stay with us. We all love you. - And we'll protect you. (barks) (bell chimes) (bouncy music) - Hello, Dorothy. You wish to go home, don't you? - More than anything, Glinda. - The power to go anywhere you wish is in your silver slippers. You had the power all along. - You mean, I could've gone home from the very first day I was here? - Yes. But then you wouldn't have met your three new friends. And without you, they would never have found their wonderful gifts. - You're right, and I wouldn't have traded that for the whole world. Toto, we're ready to go home. - Just close your eyes and click your heels together three times. - Goodbye, goodbye. - I'm sure going to miss her. - We all will. - Oh, you bet. But now she's home where she belongs, right? - Aunt Em, Uncle Henry! - Dorothy, Dorothy! - Auntie Em, Uncle Henry! - Goodbye, Dorothy. (playful music)
