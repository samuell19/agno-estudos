What? Did it just say get out? No it didn't. it didn't. it didn't. Whoa! I'm getting goosebumps! I'm getting goosebumps! What's up guys! and welcome back to Night Explorers. And do we have a doozy for you this time! Tonight we are at one of the most haunted locations in all of England. Tonight, we are at... Horton Manor. Yeah Rory come out. Fuck, I can't There-there's no handle on the door There's no handle this side either! You have to push. Danny. Danny! Danny help! It answered you man! We've got the spirit box right here and... - the EMF meter. And we even have your boy Danny, he's on the camera. So guys... Shh Did you hear something? I heard something! This is the most activity we've ever had. If you fall I'm going to laugh. I'll make sure you get locked in a room again. It's the only way in. ... towards us, its coming towards us! - Where? There, there, there! I can see it! Oh my god. Did you hear that? No. Now, in the 1960s he got himself into a lot of debt, now rather than paying it back. He killed his wife and two kids. And then hung himself. This must be the baby's room, that we're in now. Gasp! What the fuck? This is the scariest thing I've ever done in my life. All right, let's go, let's go! Go, go, go! Push. Push. Push! You know, what are you doing? I was trying to get out of there man! It's absolutely disgusting in there! I can't get out! Why didn't you fucking open the door? Hey Gabe. Yo! Ozi my man. How you doing? Hey, good, good. Just doing some editing. Yeah? Any good stuff? Always. Are you ready for Pelosi? As ready as we can be. Hey Nova. You alright Gabe? Yeah I'm great thank you Nova. So Oz, I've made all the arrangements for the 24th, and we're good to go, its just... The only downside is my contact now was ten grand rather than the five we discussed. There's nothing I can do about it. Yeah, it's no problem, buddy. You sure you can afford to do your half now? Look mate, I know I don't make as much money as you, but I've got the dough. Plus, you've got to make loads of money off this one. Yeah, you're not wrong about that. This could be the biggest video either of us have ever done. So is it a deal? Shall I let Emma and Claire know? Yeah, it's a deal. Yes. This is going to be the best one yet, buddy. Yeah. So, five k each and we get 24 hour access. Yeah? -Yep! That's the deal. And the location is about 2 hours from yours, so I suggest we bunk up at yours and then we can make our way in the morning. Yeah, that sounds like a plan mate. Right then, party at Ozi's. Who said anything about party? Oh, come on just a small one, you little prick. We'll see. Yeah, alright then. See ya later Nova. - Bye Gabe Bye Gabe. Ten grand's a lot of money. Yeah. Maybe two years ago, but not now. Plus for the video too, like the one we'll make from Pelosi, asylum we'll make that back and then some. Hmm. What you doing? Looking all the stuff I won't be able to buy any more we're down ten grand, right? Well lucky for you, it's only five now, so maybe you can get half. What are you doing? I'm kissing... the most... delicious... woman in the whole world. Delicious, That's well creepy. Hey, I'll give you bloody... - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop. Stop. Hey. I love you. Yeah, I know you do. - Hey, say it back. I love you, too. - That's better. Ah, Jim. Come on in bud, Do you mind taking your shoes off. Sorry. - Yeah sure. Drink? Uh, yeah. Bottle of water if you got it, mate. Here. - Oh, nice one man. Thank you. Everything okay with you? - Yeah. Yeah. C'mon what's eating you? I'm fine. We can talk about it later. No time like the present Jimmy. It's just, uh... - It's just what? Look I... I think we went too far in that last video. What, Horton Hall? Yeah, like, do you remember the rules that we built the channel on? Knocks, bangs, or... or something moves in the next room, but we never went too far with it, did we? So we couldn't be accused of fakery. I think you're overreacting a little bit mate. We have to evolve the channel, step it up a bit. Yeah, and I agree. But how about we evolve the channel by stopping the fake stuff and trying to find something that's real? Danny agrees with me, and he's got all that kit, hasn't he? And we have genuinely come across scary stuff in the past, you know, that. We'd have no content if we did that and you know that. In the whole time we've done this, we've had, what, maybe three, four events that were genuinely scary and not us, even those probably just people fucking with us. We have to spice it up. We'd have no viewers, you know, that bro. Yeah but, come on. There's spicing it up and then there's spicing it up. You know what I mean? This is the time of scripted reality. And everyone that knows, knows. And others like to teeter on the edge of what is real and what isn't. People don't care. This is the future of entertainment. They just want to be entertained. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe you're right. Of course I'm right, I'm always right. But yeah. So, anyway, Jim, the reason I asked you here is that I wanted you to know that I have finalized the deal with Gabe Weller and his team for Pelosi Asylum. Oh sick! Gabe and his crew. Yeah. Mate, that's going to be a lot of fun, huh? - Mmm. Yeah. And Claire and Emma are quite easy on the eyes as well. They are, aren't they. Anyway, you have Nova. I know, man. I love her to bits, but... A guy can still window shop. But look, we could be one of the last people in history to explore one of, if not the most haunted locations on Earth. And Jim boy we'll do it for real this time just like you want it. Just like the old days, no more fakery That should make you happy. It does man. Ozi, thank you. To tell you the truth, it's a win, win anyway bud, we find some paranormal activity. The viewers love it. Great. If we don't it balances out from the last video, Makes us just look a little bit more credible. You are a sneaky fucker! - Why thank you! So we good? Yeah, man. We're good. We're good. So what's the arrangements then? We're going to meet them or they're coming here. Everyone is going to come back here and then we'll go up to Pelosi in convoy the next day. Oh, mate. Big party then. Yeah? No one said anything about a party. Yeah of course. Hold on mate, two seconds. Alright... Alright! Yeah. Sorry, it's just the postman. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Take your shoes off. Yeah. Yeah. It's 24 hour access. That's what they say anyway. Yeah, second floor, second floor. - Yeah. Yeah No, of course. What up fool! Alright mate. - Alright. Looks like I'm bunking with you. It's only one bed! Well, whichever way it goes, cock to cock is the way forward. Or we could just go bum to bum. Bum to bum, cock to cock, its all George Michael to me. You just want to touch me don't you? - Hmm. Through the day and into the night. Hmm. Yeah, that's lovely. I feel that's a bit too real. Wait 'till you see the Polaroid camera, mate. Oh, we're getting it on film? - Yeah. Going to get some super sexy souvenirs for your Mrs. Oh, she'll love that. That's very courteous. Thank you. Yeah. I'm really looking forward to this Pelosi thing. It looks like a belter. - Yes, very exciting. You're going to shit yourself, of course. - Standard procedure. I will shit myself on camera. Lovely, lovely. And it will smell delightful. Like roses. Yes, like pink roses. Yes pink, fluffy roses, like a girl. On a serious note, though, I mean, I'm glad we get to do this one proper this time. I mean, the last one was getting a bit silly. So, you're not scared? - Hell no! It would be great If we saw something supernatural, see like a ghost or something. That way we would know for sure that something comes after life. Well... this could be the one. Chuck us my bag, prick. There you go twat! And if we don't find any activity in the asylum, sure as hell won't find it anywhere else Geronimo! Aiming for my dick? Now, you shall take it. No I'm a giver. No your a taker tonight. I am not a taker. - First we must have teabags for breakfast. I will teabag you 'till you die! Use lube! Do not spit! How's it going guys? Alright? Welcome, buddy. Welcome. Do you guys mind taking your shoes off? Sorry to be a pain. How's it going? Awesome crib Ozi. I love it. Thank you. Come in. Come on in. How you doing? Nice to see you. -Hi. Finally some girls in this place. - Yes. How are you? - Good, how was the drive here? I'll show you up to your room. You can unpack and then party time. Yeah! - I like that, I like that. Shouldn't we have a meeting or something first? - No, no. Don't be boring Danny. Yeah, so we all here then? Yeah, yeah, everyone's here. Actually, do you know... thinking about it why don't you go upstairs with them and get yourselves unpacked... and then I think between you and Nova we've got tonight's entertainment sorted out. You know best. - Yeah. Go away! Don't let him.. No! Right, guys, guys. We're going to the asylum first thing in the morning, yeah. We're gonna clear it with all our contacts and then give them the money. If we were to go as a convoy, do you want us to meet you there in the morning. Yeah. You know what? There's no need. We'll deal with the whole thing. And then you guys can just meet us there when your ready. You, sure? Err I think it would be a good idea to get a recce in first. No man I think we should just go into this one cold. We can have a little look around once we get there. but the place is massive. - Do you know what? I'm good with that, actually. I'm a bit fed up of doing all the groundwork beforehand. Bud? Are you sure about this? Yeah, It'll be fine. Famous last words. Nothing. Are you boys all good? Great! For tonight. We drink! Yeah! - And tomorrow we fight the forces of darkness. You guys! Enough of this dark shit let's just get fucked! Guys... Wooooo! Oh my lord! Good innit. Alright, so we all here? Mate, this place is a lot bigger than it looks in the pictures. Yeah. - Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it? No! No, it's not beautiful. No. I mean, for people like us. Oh. Yeah, yeah. See what you mean. Right. So let's get kitted up and get inside. You see that main door over there? That's the only way into the building. And as I said before, this place is just way too big to do a recce first. So I suggest that we do err... That we do a group piece to camera and then we can do a spirit box or a Ouija board and see if we can contact anything and then, you know. Split up and explore. We've got enough radios for one a pair, so don't do any solo exploration because phones don't work out here. And definitely not inside. These will be our only means of communication if anyone gets injured or lost. Obviously, we don't actually have to stay here all night. Once we feel like we've had enough, we can get a couple shots of us bunking down and then we can head back to Ozi's. Let's do it! Yeah, yeah. Right lets get this road on the show. Let' go, guys. C'mon. Danny! D'you reckon we can get the drone up, just get some shots of the outside... just before it gets a little bit too dark you know. Yeah, yeah, it's all set up and everything. So ready when you are. Cool. All right, let's do that. See you inside then mate. Okay. We all ready to go? Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Let's do this. We good? - Yeah man, let's go. What's up, guys! Whats up! - Here we are a Pelosi, we've arrived... and tonight Night Explorers here with Gabe and Claire's team. - What's going on guys! Tonight, ladies and gents... this is going to be the collaboration of a lifetime, paranormal urban exploring... history is going to be made. And it's happening right here. That's right, guys. This video is going to be longer than our normal videos and it's going to be more historical, Why? Because we are going to be the last people in history to... What the fuck was that. - What was that? Someone check it out. There. That wasn't there before. It looks like this just fell over. It's fine we'll leave it. It's started already, yeah? - Did you get that? Guys, it looks like a plank of wood fell over. How did it fall? How am I supposed to know? Maybe. Maybe it's a...Pelosigeist. I think it's just the energy from all us lot. Great energy! Guy's we've been here five minutes... and there is already some crazy, weird stuff happening. Woo! Guys, this is a seriously scary... this is a seriously scary location. And if anything happens to us, there's no one around for miles, which means help. Help is a long way away. Anyway, as I was about to say, we're going to be the last people in history to explore Pelosi Asylum. That's right. That's because next week, guys, this place has a date with a bulldozer. So let's hope that for our date tonight, Pelosi puts out So we're going to get set up with a spirit box now to really kick this night off. And with the spirit box... we'll see what spirits are still here that we can communicate with. Just to see what we're getting ourselves in for tonight. See you guys in a second Okay guys, Alright we were going to be using the Spirit Box, but Claire's got this new Necronomicon app, so we're going to be using that instead. This app filters out all of that radio noise, and it just lets the words come through. It's normally short and sweet, but it should be a lot clearer. Awesome. Turn it on. Necronomicon app on. Is it on? You ready? Are there any spirits in here that want to talk to us? NO... LIGHT.... HERE... What did it say? What did it say? It said something about light. - That's what it said. What? - That was clear. YOU CAN'T BRING ME TO THE LIGHT What is your name? GET OUT! Why do you want us to get out? EVIL HERE Guys, guys turn off, I think we've had enough. Ah yeah, shall we turn it off? No. This is amazing. LEAVE! No... no... yeah. We turn it off. LEAVE -No No No, were getting some awesome footage Off camera, is this thing real? Off or on camera. I didn't fuck with it, if that's what you're asking. Right. Right. I think because this place is so big, and we'll never be able come back here again, which should split up into smaller teams, cover maximum ground. We'll get much more bang for our buck that way. So what are the teams? Well, someone's got to stay here, make sure no one comes in and out. keep an eye on the cars. So, Danny... you can do the first shift mate. Aww what? What about all the ghost hunting gear I bought? It'll only be for an hour or six. But anyway, someone will come back and replace you. We'll do it in shifts, make this area our base camp. Sorry Bud. It's 'cause I'm ginger isn't it. Could welll be mate. Right. We can be one team and you guys... just pick between yourselves. Woah, woah, do we really have to split up? Oi look. Look, we give it an hour, yeah. If it doesn't work out, we just come back here, regroup. Yeah. An hour? One hour man! Okay. Well, I suppose I'm lumbered with Supernova then. Oi dick! You know what I mean. Go on. Nova's probably braver than all of us put together. You mind going with Rory for a bit? No, I don't. Rory's a pussy someone needs to look after him. As long as I can go with you later. I wouldn't have it any other way Guys get room. These will be our only means of communication in here. Uh, thank. You. - Danny. If anyone has any problems, use the radio. And if you can get back here, the red button on the side is an alarm. Push and hold for 2 seconds, the button will lock. Then an alarm will sound. We can use that to try and locate you if you get lost. I'm not going to get lost sitting here. Am I? All right, then. Let's get it on! Alright. Let's go. Bye then! Hello? Hello? No? Okay, okay. Fucking Shit! Fucking bastard! Is everyone okay? We thought we heard a scream. Yeah. Yeah, it was me. Sorry. Fucking bag fell over and shit myself. You scream like a bitch, Danny. Only when I'm on your mum. Danny, are you okay? Do you need me to come back? No, no, no, no. It's alright mate do your thing. I'll see you in an hour. You the boss, boss. Yeah. That's why you left me alone in the most haunted place on earth. Man, this place is creepy as fuck! Yeah I know, it's great. Dude does nothing scare you? Not ghosts, if that's what you mean. Those fast moving house spiders. Creepy as fuck! I'm on the fence. I don't really believe in shit at the moment, but, you know, it would be nice to have some kind of proof there's something after. The only thing you have to worry about here is animals and crazy people. Jesus! - The fuck was that? That was a door. Which one? Well, that one. It's the only one that's closed. Fucking hell. That door over there just slammed itself shut. It's just opened again. Yeah, it's probably just the wind. We won't know unless we check it out, will we? Go on then, ladies first. It must have been the wind. These windows are shut mate and they're boarded outside. There's no wind coming through here. What's all this shit? Well... This fucking place man! That sounded like a ceiling falling down. Nova? Nova, can you hear me? That was really loud. - Yeah. That's the problem with splitting up. We don't know if it's one of us or something else in the building. Yeah, well, that's why we have radios. Hello? Did anyone else hear that? Did someone knock something over? Yeah, we heard that but it weren't us. Ozi? Babe... Hello? Don't worry, Nova. These walls are really thick. Reception might be intermittent. That's why we have r-r-r-radios. Shut up. We're okay. Just bad reception. Yeah. We don't want to get lost in this place. We've barely scratched the surface. Ever since the closure of the asylum, there have been. Many, many reports of spirits that refuse, refuse to leave this place. Yeah and one of the spirits is a former patient called Pete. Pete was tortured and killed by the orderlies in a satanic ritual. His spirit has become a bit of a violent poltergeist. So any time anyone comes here, they get attacked. Earlier we heard a noise just up in front of us. We think it could be Pete angry with us for invading his space. What the fuck was that? What? What? Wha... Huge fucking shadow just moved up there. Are you being serious? Yes. I'm being serious. Let's go have a look. Come on. I think it came from down here. What the fuck was that? - Did someone just throw that at us? Or was it like from the ceiling? I don't know! - I'm going to check it out. Give that to me now! Claire what are you doing? Look we won't know until we check it out, right? It's a brick. It didn't come from up there. You saying someone threw that at us? Maybe it was Pete? Maybe there is someone in here with us. Someone who doesn't make any noise with their footsteps? I don't know. Okay, come on. There's nothing in here. This is where the noise was coming from. Mate. This place is really living up to its reputation. You know, maybe you were right about doing all this stuff for real. I mean, we could have just. What was that? No! Come on, pull it! Is everyone okay? I'm hearing some weird stuff down here. What the fuck? Okay. Yeah. No. Who's pissing about? Go on, Jim, Ozi? I know its one of you. Oh my God, check this out. Oh shit. Rory. Okay, camera. Hey, guys. So we just walked into this room and we found a really large ritual pentagram on the floor. Check that out. Do you think this was done when this place was open or. Or after? I don't know. It looks really well done. Like it's sort of burned into the wood. I mean, we can also see there's loads of candles around the pentagram. We know that this place was shut down because of satanic rituals by the staff, so maybe they did it then. Yeah, but it kind of looks like it was used not so long ago. Do you think? Yeah. - Ah that's well creepy. Oh, that's the last thing we fucking need. Pussy! If there are any spirits in here that wish to communicate with us, can you make the lights go to red? Or maybe you can just pass through the lights and use the energy from the battery? Oh shit! Shit. Did you see that? What, no. Ok... Maybe you were a patient here? And you were tortured by some of the staff? Oh, fuck. Are you getting this? Oh my god! Oh shit. Ahhhh, you fu... Fuck. Rory you okay? Argh! Argh, yeah, I think so. Get up. Oh... let me see. Oh, my God. You're bleeding. - It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. Head wounds always appear worse than what they are. Go on, hold it there. - Huh? Hold it there. What? You would have to use a fucking machine wouldn't ya! It probably pissed the poltergeist off or something. If that was even a poltergeist. Oh shit no signal. What the fuck was that? There's a weird symbol on it. Huh? The stone that just hit my fucking head. Oh, my God. I've seen the symbol before. It's a satanic cross. I think we should get out of here. - Yeah. Can you get up? Yeah. Yeah. Come on. - Let's go that way. You want to go where the fucking stone came from? Come on. The doors open. Open the door! Open the door! Open up! Hello. Hello? Is anyone there? Is anyone here? We have permission to be here. Anyone at all? Shit. Hello mate. Aww. Hello boy, come here. Hello. Come on buddy. Should we really be chasing whatever it is that we're after? Of course we should. This is the reason we do this. What if it's not a ghost? Oh. Hey guys, can you hear that? Dude? Oh, dude that sounded like footsteps. You know what? We should stop here. We can set up the laser grid and see if we get any movement. That's a good idea. Let's do that. Shit! - Haha are you really that scared? I was chilling until I heard those footsteps now. I'm. It's fine I'm just freaking out internally a little bit, that's all. I'm good. So after having a brick thrown at us earlier. And now here first steps, we've decided to set up this laser grid. To see if we can get any movement... like spirits Or Pete. You think someone is screwing with us? - Like who? I don't know, Rory or Gabe and that lot. No. Everyone's taking this seriously. Just like you requested. Well then, what shut that door on us? And don't say the wind, mate. We're in the most haunted place in the world. Who do you think did it? Yeah. Maybe you are right. It is why we're here after all. What was that? Ah mate I've never been so scared exploring a bando before. Maybe it was an animal. That makes me feel better. Should we like... - Shhh! Did you hear that? - No what? It's like, a voice. Like a voice or a voice? I don't know. It's like a... like a voice, but no words. Yo! Fuck this place. Let's go back to Danny and we regroup with the others. No, No, let's keep going. If nothing else, we'll get some good footage. Go! See, you're the one making all the noise, huh? Hm. Here you go boy, you hungry? You look hungry. Ohh it's crumbly! Here you go boy, hungry? Come on, come here. Come on, come here. It's nice. Aww shit. Can't believe we're locked in here like some shit horror movie! I tend to agree with you, but this is all too real. I think someone is out there. Yeah, but it could be one of us. Hello? Who's out there? Look, we need some help! Aright, ok. I can't hear anything. Look! Look at the bottom corner of the grid! It's flickering. I can't see. I can see it. I can see it. I've never seen a grid move like this. What the fuck? Holy fuck! Guys, we should go. No, keep filming. Keep filming. This is the best footage we've ever got. Shhh Listen, Listen! Guys, start grabbing the stuff. Come on boy, come on I won't hurt you. Come on boy, go on take the treat. You want the treat? I gotta a treat. Come on, I won't hurt you. Come on it's fine. It doesn't seem to be swollen. It's okay, man. It's just a twist, yeah. - Alright, yeah? Yeah. Shit, so this is going well. Yeah. Hurry up, hurry up. Now! Yeah. - Hurry up. Jim! Fucking now! Hurry up! Hurry! Fucking hurry up! - I'm trying! Ozi, I'm... Now! Move! Move! Hey guys, so we're stuck in this room, and someone's banging on the door from outside Oh my God! Oh my God! Go! Go! Go! No! No! Gabe! Oh my God! No! No! Oh my God! Oh my God. Gabe! Oh my God. Gabe. Here we go, c'mon so close now. That's it. Trot on over. There's a good boy. You know, I was thinking. You know how you were desperate to get out of that room. Yeah. I think we should go back and see what it was. What, why? Well, I know you overreacted, but... - What? It might be interesting to see what it is. - You serious? Me? Did you hear you? - It would be great footage. C'mon stop being a pussy. Let's see what it was. What do you think it is? - I dunno. Sounded like a hedgehog or something like that. Oh is that what hedgehogs sound like? Yeah. I've been fucking wondering for ages that. I don't know, maybe he's got like a little cold or something like that. Hedgehogs don't get colds, dickhead. Don't they? No! Do you see that? Yes! Fuck off! Fuck off! What's wrong with you man? Jim, Jim. Who the fuck is that? How am I supposed to know? Why has he got no face? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What have I done? Oi. It's okay. He was trying to kill us, man. You fucking had to. Why was he trying to kill us? What the fuck is wrong with him? Looks like some fucking homeless guy. This is his house. We disturbed him. I don't know. We need to get Danny, get to the others and we need to leave, now! Yeah. Come on. - You okay? I'm fine. Don't worry about me. Come on. What are we going to do, Claire? I don't know. Um... There... There could be more traps and umm.... - We need to do something. Shhh! Get up! Move! Run! Go! Fuck. Run Emma! Go! Claire? Claire? Claire? Claire! Claire! Claire! What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Please, no. Let me go. I'll go. You don't have to... Emma, Emma! Emma please open the door! What's happening? Emma go get help! Please Emma. Fuck off! Please Emma! No. No. Please. No. Please. Emma go. Claire! Claire! Hang on I'm going to get some help. What the fuck! Dave! Dave! The fuck? What the fuck! Ozi! Gabe's dead! I-I don't know about Claire. Dead? Did you say Gabe's dead? What? How? There-there-there was a trap. There were spikes above the door. Dead! So as well as looking out for crazy homeless people. You're saying we're now looking out for traps. As well? Are you sure Gabe is dead? I'm sure. Oh my fucking god! Where's Danny? I need to find Nova. We need to get out of here. Yeah, you're right. Okay. You get, get one of the cars. Go get the police. Come back here. The doors locked. The doors locked it won't budge! You need to come with me, I need to get Nova now! What the fuck is that? Is that a dog? Right. That's it there's no more splitting up. Radios don't seem to work in this place. So we need to stick together, find the others and get out of here. I can't go back in there. You have to. We are not leaving you here, okay? And we need you. We need you to show us where Claire is. Okay? That route you came, it must be safe. There must be no traps. What about Gabe? Well, if he's dead, we'll have to come back for him. When we're back home and we're safe. That's what's important right now. What's happening to us? Who the fuck is doing this to us? From what we're seeing? It's crazy fucking homeless people. And they live here. But, listen we need to find some weapons. Yeah, that's not a bad idea actually. Maybe we're being fucked with. I mean, I wouldn't put it past Claire and Gabe to set something like this up. They were gone for a long time this morning. I don't think so. This feels really different. Well whatever it is, I don't want to spend the rest of the night in here. The others are going to come for us soon. Unless we're the butt of their joke. Listen, Ozi wouldn't leave you in here, bleeding. They're going to come. This is the door. You're sure this is the door? Yeah, this is definitely the door. It's locked. You ready? It won't open. Yeah. It's locked. Locked? Oh, my God. No!! No! What the fuck is going on! Claire! Emma. I'm sorry but we have to go. But Claire. She's dead Right now we need to go find Nova and Rory. How are we gonna find anyone in this place? We'll have to try, Emma. We'll come back for her later. I'm sorry we have to go. Ozi. Ozi, can you hear me? Hello? Can anyone hear me? It's not going to work. The walls are too thick. Or something's blocking the signal. What do you mean? I think I read somewhere that mental hospitals block phone signals They don't want the madness getting out or something. Is that true? I don't bloody know, it's just something I read. Shit! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Nova! No! Ozi. Ozi I need you Ozi. Come get me please Ozi. Ozi. It's terrifying. Watch the floors. They're like, really creaky. It's so old here.
