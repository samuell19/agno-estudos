Wait for me. I have to change real quick! I'm sorry, they're waiting for me. I have to go. - See you later, bye! - Okay, be safe! Nadia? What are you doing here? Please let me go! Please let me go! What are you doing? Please let me go! Please let me go! I don't wanna die!! Help me! Help me! Help me!! Why are you doing this to me? Please, let me go! Let me go please!! Please let me go! Let me go! Why are you doing this to me?! Why are you doing this, I don't wanna die!! Please let me go! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! - Are you recording? - Yes, Doctor Fabrizi... The left end of the injury started below the ear at upper third of the neck... and deepened gradually with severance of the left carotid artery. What the hell... Still recording, Doctor... Please, stop it. Stopped. I need to think about this... - Are you trying to run me over? - I'm trying to save our jobs! - What's that supposed to mean? - The podcast starts in half an hour! - No, it doesn't. - Yes, it does. The show starts at 10, and it's only... - 8:30! - Wrong! Daylight saving time ended last night. Oh no! You forgot to change your watch... again. - Shit! What are we gonna do? - Hurry! We still can make it! But I can't go like this! I need to take a shower first! Impossible! No time! At least I wanna smell good when they fire us! Nobody is gonna fire us! We've got all the sponsors! I don't give a damn about your sponsors. It was showtime and your asses were nowhere near that booth, so I did what I had to do! But, Marvin... For you it's Mr. Jones, sweetheart... Besides, he's doing a good job... He can't... He just can't... Maybe; but today, he's hosting your show! Marvin... What's that smell? Marvin, can we at least discuss this? We could if you didn't have somewhere to go... What do you mean? Where are we going? - District Attorney's office. - What for? Press conference about a double homicide. - Oh come on! - Just another Monday morning in Chicago... That's Sullivan's job! Not today. Today it's yours. Oh, here you go! Eww... what is that smell? Come on, Pilar... Let's go. Uh oh... What? I think we're late again... What are we gonna do now? I mean, we can't come back with our hands empty... - We won't. - We won't? - Nah... Call your girl. - Who? The forensic girl... Tracy! Of course! She'll spill the beans for us! Of course she will. She's crazy about you. She sure is... Hey wait... Maybe I should take a shower first. Don't worry. She won't notice... - Are you sure? - Of course... She's used to smelling corpses all day long so... Shut up! Something smells funny... - Does it? - Yeah... I think it's the cheese... That could be... So you were saying it was a double murder? Yeah. The girl had her throat slit from ear to ear... She bled to death. We see that everyday. Of course... But the dude... Man! That was a shocker! His throat was all torn, like chewed up. He had flesh hanging all over his neck... It was something else! - Maybe a dog did it. - Yeah, or maybe rats... We'll find out as soon as we get the lab results, but there's more! More? We found tissue under his nails... From a fight! Probably! So you've got the killer's DNA now! You would think so, only it was dead tissue... What do you mean? Whatever he scratched had been dead for a very long time. I mean it was rotten flesh. Stinky dead rotten tissue! - That's crazy! - I know, right? The cheese is fine... It's good, actually! Are you eating yours? Excuse me! Can I have this to go, please? - Get the fuck out of the car! - Get out of the car! Get out of the car! - Get the fuck out of the car! - Please, don't shoot me! Oh god, they're coming back! Marvin, d'you know what time it is? What? No, no, no, no, no... Don't send Ron, no! We are on it! Yes, we got this! We'll be on time, I promise. What happened? Hurry up, we have to move! Move where? Another double murder! There's a press conference in an hour. - Does it mean you can take a shower this time? - I hope so! Yeah, that makes a bunch of us. I talked to Tracy. She says one of the carjackers had his throat ripped off. Are you kidding me? Tracy just sent me a text. She says the Lieutenant is already speaking!- Shit! Step on the gas, Shelley! I don't wanna have an accident; we don't have insurance! The second carjacker was a twenty-year-old male, with four previous arrests for charges including burglary, child endangerment, and domestic battery. Lieutenant Pulaski, can you comment on the rumor that this was some kind of street justice by the people who are tired of gun violence and crime in the city? That's ridiculous, because... Lieutenant; I'd like to respond to that... Of course, Madam Mayor... That was an irresponsible question... We need real dialogue that goes beyond just a discussion about who has the best data but rather expands to a conversation about... how to responsibly use these statistics to drive smart decision-making and the reduction of violent crime. From our perspective, we want to talk about how to save lives... reduce violence and eradicate the socioeconomic factors that contribute to it. I - I have a question, Mayor... Yes? For Doctor Fabrizi... For me?? Could you confirm or not whether these two crimes were committed by the same person? What kind of question is that, Franco? Of course they were. They were killed in the same parking lot within minutes of each other! No, I'm not talking about the two carjackers; I'm talking about this crime and the photographer and the model that were killed last weekend. Well, both crimes are under investigation, so there's no need for speculation. - I'm not speculating; I'm just asking... - And I'm responding. Nothing indicates these two crimes have anything to do with each other. Not even the fact that their necks were all chewed up? That's it! No more questions! A full statement will be sent to your contact information. Thank you! I can't... How did they know that?? I know; right?! You guys've been talking to your wives? Not me! No, no, no! You were terrific! Thank you! Excuse me, ladies... - Ladies? - Yup; she said “ladies”. Who are you with? - S.J.N. - Who? “Social Justice Network”? Social Justice my ass. You two work for Marvin; don't you? Oh, you know Marvin! Yeah. Maybe I should give him a call about reassigning this story to someone else... What's the name of that reporter he usually sends? Sullivan. Yes, Sullivan. I like Sullivan. He conducts himself in a very professional manner. Look... These are serious issues and I think Marvin shouldn't be sending unprepared interns to cover city press conferences. I agree. If you'll excuse me... Ladies. - Ugh... You know what this means! - Calm down... Deep breath... It's on! - It's on! - I knew it! We are gonna stay on this story, we are gonna solve this case! We're gonna catch the killer before the cops do! It's on, you hear me? - Relax! - It's on! Intern? Who's is she calling an intern?? I know exactly what I'm doing! I know exactly where I'm going! It's ON; I mean it! - Where are the elevators? - The other way. It's on! Lord, have mercy... You are not going to use the airwaves of my radio station to promote your crazy conspiracy theories! Now wait a minute, Marvin! “Airwaves”? What century is this? Listen, I'm not going to lose my license over some insane leaked information on a killer biting people's necks! What are your sources? I can't mention names and get people fired; you know that! You know how it works! Exactly! Because I know how it works, it's my job to set the standards! Oh, please... This might be a new concept to you two, but there's this little thing called “social responsibility”! With whom? The Mayor? I'm not even going to respond to that... Of course not! Hey! Marvin! Do me a favor: get some garlic, a crucifix, and get the hell out of my station! Son of a bitch... Let go, Kolchak. You need to relax; come on... Hey, Maxwell... What's up, Ron? Is it true that the killer used his teeth to bite on his victims' throats? Not only that... He twisted their spines and broke almost every bone in their bodies... Oh my god... I've done two tours in Afghanistan and never heard of anything like this... There was blood... Flesh... Organs all over the crime scenes... Oh Jesus... On top of that... You should've seen your face, Sullivan! That wasn't funny! I bet your shitted in your Hanes! It's not funny at all! How did she know my brand? What?! You have another call. It's the Mayor's office. Again?? I wonder if he's gonna kill again tonight... What makes you so sure it's a “he”? It's got to be. He's too sloppy. I'm sloppy. No, you're not. You're dedicated; and your followers love that. I don't know... Speaking of followers, how many views so far? None. I haven't posted yet. You haven't? Why not? What are you waiting for? Marvin's “airwaves”? I can't believe he said that. The man is stuck in the eighties! We are influencers! We control the message! Until we get canceled... Then we look for new platforms! I guess you're right. Of course I am! Go ahead, hit post! Posted! That's my girl! Now we need to celebrate. How did you call it? “Night Hunt - Blood thirsty killer roams the streets of Chicago” Damn, that's aggressive! I thought you liked it! I do, I love it! Really love it! This is good. It's gonna make me tipsy. That's the plan. Are you trying to seduce me? Maybe; why? It's working. Don't pick up. At least let me see who it is... It's probably Marvin firing us after reading your blog. Hi Tracy. I read your blog. Did I get you in trouble? No, that's not why I'm calling. Listen... we've got some new evidence. The lab's results are back... The DNA found on the carjackers and the photographer match, so it's conclusive they were killed by the same person. Good! So my report is accurate. - Well... Not really. - Why not? The model was killed with a knife. The detectives now think she was killed by the photographer, and I would agree with that. That's interesting... I'm interesting... So now that the photographer changed from victim to suspect... his studio is much more than a crime scene... That's exactly what they said at meeting this evening. How long do you think we have before the cops turn that place upside down? I would say until tomorrow morning at the latest. Thank you, Tracy. You're the best! I am the best... Hold it; one more thing... The saliva found on the victims' throats is human. Human?? Yes, no dogs, no rats; human. Human and dead. You mentioned the tissue before... Whatever it was that they scratched or got bitten by... was dead. I mean long-time dead. And that DNA doesn't match anything in our files, so this is gonna take a while... Jesus... Listen, I gotta go now. Good luck tonight! Well? - Get dressed. - Get dressed? We're going out. Such a beautiful night... to get arrested. Or killed! I thought the killer was dead. The photographer is dead. And, according to Tracy, the guy who killed him is “deader”. - “Deader”? - Aha! - So we have nothing to worry about! - What are you doing? - We're gonna be seen from outside! - How are we going to see inside? Hold on... - Oh! - See? Night vision! - Smart girl! - Hmmm Genius! He was a good photographer. Meh... the models are hot, though. What do you think happened here? Everything? A ritual? What kind of ritual? The kind where they bleed people to death? It happens in churches all around the country. They call it “donations”. Look over there! This is weird... Is that the photographer? I don't think so... The “deader guy”? What'you doing? Sorry, but I need to see more. Alright, here we go. I hope Marvin can bail our asses out of jail. Look... Here's our photographer. What the hell happened here? Let's... Let's compose this... Uh oh... First, the photographer kills the model in some kind of satanic ritual right here. Okay, that's the easy part. Third... Wait, wait... You are skipping “second”. Bare with me. Okay, Sherlock... Third, the photographer gets killed right here by... - The “deader” guy! - Correct. And where did the “deader” guy come from? That's... See? That I have no clue. And that's number two. That's number two... Something happened right here... after a ritual over there... that resulted in a son of a bitch getting chewed up to death over there... and I have no idea what it was. And it's driving me crazy! I know... Who is the deader guy? What are these prints? Where did he come from? Transylvania? That little box? Look... This seems to be a big-ass “deader” guy, and that's a tiny-ass box. - It's not a box; it's an urn. - A what? An urn. Like the ones they use to put “deader” guys in when they're still ashes? Still ashes, huh? Yeah, you know how it works... You've seen the movies too; haven't you? I'm afraid I have... Number one: devil worshiper crazy-ass photographer kills one of his models and collects her blood in a cup. Number two: Dracula-fan son of a bitch photographer mixes dead model's blood with “deader” guy's ashes and wakes him up from the grave. And number three: Deader guy woke up moody and hungry and, instead of rewarding his ass with eternal life, he decides to have a shit-head photographer for dinner. I rest my case. - Bravo! You should be a writer. - I am. Cool, Hemingway; you've got your story. Can we go home now? It's getting creepy. Not yet. I've got my story, but I need some visuals. Hey, that's my job! I'll record some video too. We need to find out anything we can about this guy. Dead or Deader? Dead. The photographer. He's the key to find the other one. - Where's Porto Alegre? - Who? Porto Alegre. Portugal? Don't look at me. I got lost in Indiana. And Colonia del Sacramento? California! No; not Sacramento. Colonia del Sacramento. Hum... Baja California? Uruguay! At least the money is from Uruguay. Okay, I think I'm done. Can we go now? - Take some pictures of these papers and we can go. - Okay. It's easier to look at pictures later than to read in the dark now. You're right... It's getting creepy here. Let's go. You don't seriously believe any of this shit; do you? - What do you mean? - Vampires. I believe anything and everything first, and then I desbelieve later. That's not very scientific; is it? On the contrary: science is constant doubt and it is never settled. At this rate, we'll end up writing for the QAnon Digest. I wonder is he's out there tonight... Hunting. I hope not... If he is, people need to know. You can't save the world, Pilar. By myself maybe not, but you and I together? We got this! Lord have mercy... Man, this is bullshit! I don't understand why I can't take her with me. She's not a suspect; is she? Of course not, Mr. Stevens; but she's a witness to a violent crime, and she could be in danger. We can take care of my sister way better than y'all can! You know, even if that was true... It is true! We don't need no cops! Officer Pulaski! - That's Lieutenant... - Man, whatever! And you need to go talk to her! Your sister isn't ready to go yet. Yeah? We'll see about that! Sandra! Where's my sister at, man? Sandra! I'll have the nurse bring your medication, okay? - For what? - It will help you sleep tonight. - I don't wanna sleep. - I know, but you really need to. Doctor Kahn... Yes? You do believe me, right? I believe that you need to get some sleep. Yes? - Miss Stevens, I believe your brother is here... - Get out of the way, man! T.J.! - Oh god! - It's okay, sis... It's okay. I'm here. - I got you! You alright? - Yeah... - Let them have a few minutes. - Thank you. Sister, you sure about this? You know me and my boys can protect you better than the whole police department. Yeah, T.J. I know you can! I just... - I feel like I need to stay here... - Why? Because I want to help. - If anything happens, you call me... - Yeah... - I'll be right back! - Okay! Oh shit... I knew I forgot something... I forgot something. Now what? Sis, I almost forgot... Momma... she wants me to give you this... - Give me what? - Hold on... - What is this? - Look, she wanted me to give you this... Alright... She says Jesus will protect you. You know how momma is... Yes, I know how momma is. And she also knows I'm not a religious person... Listen, just wear it, take a selfie and send it to her. It'll make her happy, okay? - Yeah, okay... - Alright... - I guess... - That's all you gotta do. Bye... Thank you - Call me! - Aha... Hey man, you'd better get your ass off that phone! Something happens to my sister, I'ma come back and kick your ass... - Go home... - Toy Cop... Can I help you? T.J.? Oh my god... Oh my god! T.J.! - Where the hell did those shots come from? - I think this way! Let's go! No! No! No!! No! What the hell was that? Two men down, two men down! - No, no, no! - Calm down, please! Where did he go? Where did he go? Where did he go? Where did he go? Where did he go? Where did he go? Chicago has a new enemy... As in other large cities in this country, Chicagoans have learned to live with big challenges... I told you I got you... We have become accustomed to dealing with violence, marginalization, racial tension, viruses, and lockdowns. We are strong and resilient. It seems that nothing can beat us. We always find a way to overcome adversity and move on with our lives. However... very occasionally... there are challenges that defy all logic. The lessons of history that prepare us to adapt to everything, or almost everything, fail us. Suddenly, we find ourselves unprotected... confused, and scared. Against all reason, we are left to cling to old forgotten forms of defense that we had already purposely disposed of. Science is not enough and superstition becomes the light at the end of the tunnel... I'm Pilar Franco, and this is “The Hammer”. Well, I'm glad you didn't mention the “V” word. Well, you told us you would fire us if we did, so... Yeah, that's quite an incentive, Marvin. Have you considered a career in Human Resources? I'm not firing your asses; at least not today. Not until you... What's the word? “Engage” with your followers. - Wow... I'm impressed, Marvin! - Yeah, that's influencer talk 101! Okay, influencers, respond to your e-mails! You've got hundreds of them. Our live-chat is on fire as well as our hot-lines. “Hot-lines”? See that... That's last century shit. Yeah, you were doing just fine until now. Enough of that! We're losing revenue by the minute. Now, move! Oh, Marvin, I wanted to talk to you about some ideas I have for engagement... Ron... I'm a married man. Not even my type... T.J., where are we? Nicole's house. Nicole's house? Why? You said you'd be taking me home! Look... Calm down. We can't go home. Why not?? Sis, please! Trust me, okay? I know what I'm doing. I know how to hide. - But T.J... - Sandra, look... If that son of a bitch decides to come back around, I'm gonna be ready for him... Okay? and it can get nasty... - You know what I mean? - Exactly, which is why we... We don't want momma to see that now... do we? I guess not. Alright... Trust me... You'll be safe here. They let her go?? Yeah, her brother took her home this morning... I think. Can you try to find out where she lives? I can try. I can't believe they would let her go! She's in danger! I don't blame them after last night. Gee, I'm glad I'm working the morning shift this week! Sandra Stevens should be in a police station surrounded by armed cops. Armed? Armed with what? Wooden crosses and stakes? Bullets didn't do much... Oh my god, we got 653 e-mails in the last 24 hours! When Marvin said the chat was on fire I didn't know he meant California state-wide wildfire! Engagement is the dream of all influencers... I don't know where to start! Organize them by sender and start with the ones who sent more messages. Good idea. What would I do without you? - Where's Crowley? - Who? Porto Alegre is in Brazil. Colonia del Sacramento is in Uruguay; NOT in Baja California... Okay, that was a wild guess... And now I found a note that says “Crowley”. Hey, I thought you were going to respond to messages too! I'll do that later; this is important. How do you spell “Crowley”? Never mind; I found it. You're fast with Google! I never use Google. Here it says that there are 6 cities named Crowley and they're all here in the US. They're in Texas, Oregon, Louisiana, Colorado, California and Arkansas. Baja California? Maybe it's not a place; maybe it's a person. Speaking of persons, we have a total winner here. This girl sent fifty four e-mails this morning only! That's the definition of “follower”. More like a cult-follower. And many of them are voice-messages. Should I play one? Why not? I'm not making much progress here anyway... Here you go... What the hell? Sounds like someone speaking Spanish with a broken jaw! Not the Spanish I know. What's her name? She signs “Lady Trotsky”. Must be Russian! That's not Russian. Let me look her up... Here's another one... Did she say “Crowley”? I don't know. I don't understand one word of what she's saying. Listen to this: Lady Trotsky a.k.a Renata Cezimbra is a Brazilian writer from Porto Alegre... Porto Alegre? Listen: Cezimbra has published several novels and articles about vampirism claiming they're based on historical facts. Most of her stories originate from local folklore from Buenos Aires... - Uruguay! - No, that's Argentina... I told you I got lost in Indiana. And Montevideo; now that's Uruguay. Do you think she knew the photographer? - She knows something and we have to get in touch with her. - I'm on it. - I'll be right back. - Where are you going? - To the studio. I wanna try something. - Do you need help? No. Try to get Lady Trotsky on zoom or skype or anything where we can record her. I'll be right back. Now you see why I wanted to bring you here, sis. I know the cops didn't have this set-up! I guess not. You don't even have to be right here to see it. I'm gonna send you a link and all you have to do is look at your phone and you can see the cameras wherever you are! You don't even need an app! Yeah, T.J... it's real cool... Because if that son of a bitch shows up here and we see him... we'll be ready for him! - So you guys did all this for me? - Not really... Nicole already had these cameras set up. Why would Nicole need so many cameras? Don't even ask... Hey, Sandra... They're talking about you. If you are watching this, please get in touch with me. My direct contact information is on the live chat; please call me. I have information that can save your life... She's lying! I will not disclose your location, I don't even need to know where you are... Sounds sincere to me... Thanks, Nicole. Sure! I don't know, T.J... Maybe I should call her. That's a bad idea! But she says she wants to help. She's lying through her teeth! You're just a story to her! Look, she will do exactly the opposite to what she said she wouldn't do! She will expose our location! You can't trust the media! Well, that was different... I hope it works. He will kill her, Shelley; we both know that. What the hell was that? Sending private messages through my airwaves? - The “airwaves” again... - Marvin... What is this? A Radio Public Message Board?? - Marvin... - What?? - What?? - Hi... You've got another phone call from the Mayor's Office... The sound pretty pissed... Jesus... I should have bought that farm in Wisconsin, but no, Marvin... you had to spend your stimulus check on a radio station! I could have been a farmer... in Wisconsin! He would have made a good farmer. Did you get in touch with Lady Trotksy? - Yeah, she replied right away... - I knew she would... I have the chat open. I'm just waiting for her. Why are you running it through PowerPoint? It's a hack I found on Reddit. It will solve our language barrier problem. We'll have automatic translation captions; how about that? - I thought Zoom had interpreters. - They do, but... Do we really want someone else to listen to this conversation? You mean other than Gates and Zuckerberg? Oh, I think she's on! Hi! How are you? Oh, maybe we won't need any of this! Hi Renata; that's your name; right? Yes, Renata. Si... Yes... My name. Can you speak English? It works! Don't worry! Can you understand English? - Perfect! - This is gonna work! Renata, why did you get in touch with us? Why did you write all those e-mails? - Andrew Craig? - The photographer... Did you know Andrew Craig? Did you mention Crowley when you reached out to her? Not at all. And we haven't published those pictures either. Renata... Who is Crowley? Did you say 1600s? So where does Andrew Craig fit in all this? What did Andrew Craig want? - It all makes sense now... - Yeah... I think we got everything we needed. Renata, thank you so much! You're awesome! You've helped us more than you'll ever know! There's someone else trying to join us... Who's Janet? Let her in... Met who? Craig? “Hola”... Only for you, Renata! Excuse me... Uh oh... language... translation! Is it gonna work in two languages at the same time? I mean three?? I don't know. I'm hacking my way through this... I speak English... A little “few”... - Oh my god... I... - I love your work! You are very nice, thank you! I didn't know... I didn't think... I never write about Crowley and what happened back in the 80s... I've never done it and I never will... I leave that to Renata. I've spent the last thirty years trying to forget him... But... I always knew this day was coming. I'm not sure we are talking about the same Crowley There is only one. Well, you certainly look gorgeous for someone who's been around since the 1600s! This is mi amiga Shelley. I do the writing and she takes the pictures. You two remind me of my friend Pato and I when we were young. She was also a photographer. A very good photographer. What happened to her? Crowley... Pato and I were following him close... Maybe too close... And she paid the price with her life... He almost killed me too, but the... The sunrise beat him. He didn't make it on time to his grave... And the sunrise... the rays... burned his flesh and his bones. I saw him become ashes right in front of my eyes! And those ashes are the ones that Andrew Craig brought here... No... The ashes went to the bottom of the river; I throw them myself. But then how...? In the last five years, we have... How do you say? When the water comes down... The tide? When the river dries up, miles and miles of... land? appear. And people from all over come looking for gold coins or other stuff in the sand. Treasure hunters. Yes. Someone came looking for a treasure but found a curse... And now you have the curse. Yes, but... thanks to you, we are going to break this curse. Yes, we're gonna beat his ass! I think you need to be very careful... Crowley is... evil. And... He won't stop. You beat him once. I was lucky... And you will need to be lucky too. I don't... I don't recognize this number... Hello? Hello? Hi... Is this the radio station? This is Pilar Franco. Is this... Sandra Stevens? Yes... How did you know I would call? I've been told I'm overly confident. That makes two of us. Not tonight, though. I know what you mean. Listen, I'm not being recorded or anything, am I? No, of course not. And you don't have me going live on the radio or anything, right? No; it's just us talking. Good... Because if my brother knows that I was talking to you, he would be pissed... That's why I'm whispering here... I understand... - What happened with Betty last night, man? - I'll tell you what happened with Betty... I was with Betty and her sister came by too... Hey man, what the hell are you all doing? T.J... it's cold outside. You got this big fire, man; we're gonna be seen! Go check on Sandra. We got this... Stupid! Then he was like walking in circles... He was furious! But he also seemed scared at the same time... Was it there a crucifix on the wall? No... Did you have a cross on you? Yeah, I did! I had a crucifix with me... Why? Do you still have it?? Hum... I think it's around here somewhere... Why? Keep talking... I'm sorry if this all sounds crazy and too far out... Nothing sounds crazy or too far out... Especially if you'd seen the things that I've seen... His eyes... Are you safe? Do you have enough protection. Oh, I have a lot of protection... But I don't feel safe. Find the cross and... Call me any time... I'll be up all night. Okay... Thank you. Hey... We are doing everything we can. She sounds like such a good person; you know? And I'm sure she is... We'll have a chance to meet her and... go for a cup of coffee when this is all over. God... I hope you're not another one... What's wrong with that dog? - Maybe it's seeing something. - No, that crazy dog barks all night. I wish it stopped barking Maybe it needs to get laid... It's getting on my nerves! Maybe you need to get laid. It's gonna keep on barking, man! Did y'all hear that? Seems like the owner finally had enough... The owner works nights... That's why the dog barks all night long. What? Where the hell are they going? Sandra? Are you alright? Is everything okay? Yes... I think so. You said I could call at any time... I hope you don't mind. Of course, I asked you to do this. Are you okay? Yeah... I think so... Everything is weird... What do you mean? Where are you? I'm in a room looking at all these screens... What screens? Hold on... This is serious! She just sent us a link. To what? To everything. Did you get it? Yes, but I don't see you. Yes... There are no cameras here. Did they leave you alone?? Yeah... Why?? What's going on? I don't know. Sandra! Sandra, what's going on?? I don't know... I don't know... I don't know... I don't know... Run! Sandra, stay there! T.J.! Sandra, you need to get out of there! Shelley, we need to call the cops! Pilar, we don't know where this is! I don't see him! Sandra, he's in the house!! Nicole!! Nicole!! Where is he? Where is he?? Run! Run hide!! Sandra! Come on! Quick, come on! Be quiet! Wait... wait here... wait! Get out!! Sandra... wait... wait here... I'll be right back... Die! Die motherfucker! T.J.!! God! Be careful! Sandra watch out!! - Run! - No! No! I thought you two could use this. Did you put anything in it? Only the good stuff. Thank you, Tracy. You're an angel. Speaking of angels... He's on his way now. He's been talking to the Mayor for an hour and he's pissed! Just another day in the life of Lieutenant Pulaski, I guess. Good luck, girls. What the hell are you doing here? Coffee. Get back to your lab. Yes, Mi Lord... So you didn't record any faces... No. As we already told you, we didn't have permission to record. What about the security cameras? Same answer. Honest reporters, huh? What a concept... Did you check with the cell-phone company? I'm sure they record everything all the time, anyway. Yeah, we did and all we got was blurry video of a bunch of guys shooting at each other. What? Same with the CCTV cameras. Maybe he can't be photographed... Like with mirrors... Here we go again... Listen Lieutenant, we know what we saw! Yeah, I wish you did! We do! And so do you! At the hospital; remember? I have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, Jesus... All this crazy talk needs to stop! Because the Mayor says so? No, because I say so! What's wrong, Lieutenant? Are you and the Mayor afraid of looking incompetent? Don't push me, Franco. A bunch of unresolved murders should be just another day for the Cook County State's Attorney's office! Enough! You don't know what you're dealing with. Actually, we do; and we have a suspect. - Do you? - Who? I'm not going to discuss that with you two. Of course! It'll be released today on a press conference. So stay low and stay out of this investigation or I'll throw your asses in jail! You can't arrest us! I can and I will. On what charges?? Obstruction of Justice and that's an easy one. Just don't make me. Can we go now? Yeah, not soon enough! You know, you can always close your eyes, but you can't close your ears... What? - For as long as I live, I think I'll always remember the sounds that she made... - Stop it... Gasping for air while she was being strangled... Pilar, stop it! There was nothing we could have done! Maybe. Maybe not. There was nothing... - Maybe the cops knew where she was... - Stop... And all we had to do was pick up the phone! Maybe we should leave the city. I'm sure he saw us. I don't wanna run. - Okay then, let's go shopping. - What? - I don't know about this one. - Why not? It's Holy Water. What if it's not? What if it's just tap water? That lady from the Botánica said it was Holy Water and I believe her. Do we wanna risk it? Ouch! Shit!! - And what is this?? - It's Christ Thorns. What are we supposed to do with it? Prick him to death? I read it can bleed a vampire to death! - This is stupid! - Well, you didn't wanna leave the city! How close do we need to get to use any of this?? Did you see what he did to those guys?? I'm sorry, but they had just ran out of wooden stake cannons! And speaking of wooden stakes, we need to make them. There's a knife on the table. This is bullshit! He's gonna tear us apart before we can even find his chest! Do you have any better suggestions?! Unknown. Let me screen this. My name is Rachel Stone. I'm an attorney. Scam. I represent Mr. Virgil Salcedo. My client would like to discuss matters related to the late Andrew Craig... Craig! Please, give me a call back at your earliest convenience. This is a fairly urgent matter. Thank you... Hi... Yes... This is Pilar Franco... When and where? I am the suspect that will be announced during a press conference later this evening... But as you know... I am not the killer. So why are they pinning this on you? Let's just say that I'm not in good terms with the city... And my association with Andrew Craig presented as the perfect opportunity to get rid of me. Why aren't you in good terms with the city? That's not part of this conversation... Rachel... Let me handle this, please... My beef with the city has to do with politics, money, contracts... Not murder. They want an enemy out of the picture and they need a scapegoat for their incompetence, and you're looking at both right now. - Mr. Salcedo... I still don't see... - Please, please... let me just finish... In about an hour I will turn myself in... That's just the start of the mediation process... Rachel likes fancy legal terms, but the fact is that I'm gonna get my ass handed for something I did not do. The D.A. and the Mayor will declare victory... And after tonight, you two will be the only ones looking for the real killer. That includes the media. They're not interested. I already asked. - I bet you did. - Yes, I did. I need you. I need the narrative. We don't do “narratives”. I need you to find the killer. I haven't heard anything that will get us any closer to that. I can be generous. Generous? How old are you? Twenty six, twenty eight? I bet you're drowning in student debt. I can help with that. How about you? The army paid for my education. I don't owe a cent. But I bet you don't own a cent either. We are wasting our time here... Andrew Craig hired me to find him several properties for the past few years. Some here, some in South America. More precisely, he was interested in buying a house in Uruguay, in a small city called Colonia del Sacramento. Go on... He also asked me to find him a building here in the city. Something that had been abandoned for a long time, something rundown, dark, and isolated with no next-door neighbors. - Did you find it? - Oh yes, I did... And I sold it to him for an insane amount of money. He didn't blink an eye. On closing day, we went out to celebrate. Got a couple of drinks. He got tipsy and spilled the beans. He told me he'd bought it for his Master. His Master? If you ask me, I think he meant the Devil. Close enough. Do you have an address? I can do better than that... I've got the keys. What if Salcedo is part of this just like Craig was? What if this is a trap? We are under attack and people are dying. We can either lockdown and hide or go out and fight. What will it be? You know I can fight. I know you don't like to talk about the war... Have you ever killed anyone? Let's go. I can't believe this... He's not in this building. Why would he lie? Why would Salcedo lie? Maybe he didn't; I don't know. I think we should get out of here before it gets dark. Yeah; maybe it's a trap. Let's go. Pilar... What'you doing? These windows have newspaper! - So? - Why would they do that? I don't know... Paint job? To prevent sunlight from coming in! Or... to paint the interior without messing up the windows... There's nothing to see! Can we go now? Clearly nobody's been here for years! - I would agree, but... - But what? This edition is from two weeks ago. Pilar! Pilar!! No!! Nooo!! For as long as I live, I think I'll always remember the sounds that she made... You can't save the world, Pilar... No! No! No! Pilar! Pilar!! Wake up! Pilar! No! No!!! No! Take me! Take me, motherfucker!! Take me!!! Are you okay? This morning, we woke up to the news that Virgil Salcedo hanged himself before he was arrested. Or was it afterward? It doesn't really matter. We've all seen the memes and popular wisdom indicates that they never hang themselves... With Salcedo's death, the official story is now fully confirmed: After a week of terror, a dangerous criminal was identified and took his own life before he was apprehended by our city heroes... By the time you hear this story, you will be confronted by two completely different versions of the truth. Just remember that “two completely different versions of the truth” cannot coexist. One of them is false. If history has taught us anything, is that most of the time, the official story is not the truthful one. You might find comfort in believing it since the official story is usually the most convenient one. Wow... What's the occasion? Well... We killed Crowley. You've got the right to speak. You've got the right to speak and question... And if they try to shut you up by telling you that science doesn't back you up... remind them that science is never ever settled... I'm Pilar Franco, and this is “The Hammer”. One of these days, you're gonna get us killed. - Influencers don't get killed; they get deplatformed... - Same shit. Until that happens to us, let's keep our followers happy and engagement is the name of the game. Speaking of engagement... I was hoping we need to find a more permanent solution. If you're talking about Marvin, we're not ready to launch our own platform yet... I'm not talking about our careers... I was talking about us. Don't play with me, girl... Actually, I was hoping to play with you for the rest of our lives. Ouch! Ouch... I don't think this is gonna work... I guess not! It's not gonna be easy, you know... I wouldn't have it any other way...
