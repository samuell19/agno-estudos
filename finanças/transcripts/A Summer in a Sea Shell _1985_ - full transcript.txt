Music composed by Directed And you let Tomaz go? -Of course, they're both from Piran. -You always let just the Piran boys go! To our beach! -I'm leaving now. I'll fetch you later to go to the salt works. -We couldn't go swimming because of you. -What are you doing here anyway? Swim at home! -And we're going to settle matters with Filip! I can swim wherever I want to. -No, you'll swim where we'll tell you to! -You'll have to eat a little more first. One, two, three and four. One, two, three... Hello, Fatso! Have you ever heard about Good reading? Is that you? Got no time to talk. What are they doing here? -Dancing or something. They've been jumping here all day. -Why don't you go swimming? My aunt doesn't allow me to because it's too hot. My aunt said... -Which aunt? -Aunt Angela. Look what I've got - my aunt's gift! Aunt Angela's? -No, aunt Rosy's. Look at that! You'll see what the sea's like. Tomaz! Tomaz! Tomaz! Are you coming out? Do you always have to hang around? There was quite a crowd on the beach today. Cross country. -Can anything happen without you? -You know I'm working in the afternoon. And put this down at once! Where did you get them anyway? Luka gave to me. -Of course. People say the shells are disappearing. -Stop it, mum! Luka grows them, not steals them. Wash your hands! We're alone, and you're not helping me. Call my father for help! Watt! I beg your pardon? You should say please! -What is the dog's name. What a silly name! You could call it please. Don't you mean what, please? Yes! -And what's your name? What, please. Quiet there, Watt, please! Are you new around here? Yes. From the shop. -Oh, a tourist! Milena! Ah, you're Milena! -You've guessed. You're quite a clever boy! Where are you and Watt going? To some salt works. It's none of your business. Come on, Milena! We'll run out of water! I didn't tell you to take a bath. Who were you talking to? -Watt. You should say please. -It was Watt please. I'm not hungry. I prefer shells. Don't you dare pull faces! Eat up and shut up! See? And you said you weren't hungry? Here's a letter for you. From my father? -It's for you to read - I won't. Bye! I won't... but it's already open. Hello, Vedi! -Were you late again? Vedi is ready! GOOD... GOOD... My father wrote. -What did he write? -He invites us to come to Ljubljana. That's silly. ERROR TRY AGAIN Talk to your mother. My family is no family. Tomaz! Tomaz! What a style! Will you stop jumping? If you say just one word to anyone we won't be friends any more. OK? Her name is Milena. She's got a dog. She'll be at the salt works. I'll introduce her to you, if you've been in love! And Polona? Forget her. -The same will happen to Milena. Let's go. -I've been working hard all morning. Let me eat in peace. What's going on? FILIP IS A FLIPPER! You've become famous! -The colour's still fresh. I bet it was the gang from Portoroz! -They're challenging us again! Look! FILIP IS A FILLET! Filip is a fillet and you'll be a cutlet soon! How many dots has a ladybird got? What are you doing, boys? -It wasn't us. It was Dario from Portoroz. -Because I didn't let them go swimming today. Let's go. And leave Luka to clean up after you. Tomaz! This is my friend. -Watt. -No, it's Milena. I've already met her. She's new - from the shop. And you're Tomaz the curtain! Do you always hang by the window? No. He sometimes also runs along the beach. He's some runner... The marathon! -I know the dog, too. What an animal lover, all of a sudden! -Oh, yes - a lover! Fire! Fire! -You mean smoke. There's no smoke without fire. -It's true - somebody's made a fire. Let's hurry! Let's hurry! -It's behind our house. Which aunt gave that to you? -Aunt Greta. Why do you stick to Fatso? -What's the matter with you? He's OK. Give me a bit. If he'd let us go swimming you'd get some. Now you're blaming me! -You saw for yourselves there was no chance! -Yes, because of me. This is our house now! Look what he fastened on the door! -Caught in the act! -A saboteur! From a cartoon! Hey, look! Piran cowards! We'll meet again - don't worry! Down with the Piran gang! Let them go, it's no use. What are you laughing at? -She'll give you a whirl! Let's go swimming. Fatso, are you eating again? -That's very witty. My name is Boris, not Fatso. -Do show us how to dive! Do what? -Dive, you dummy! Let's get away. Fatso's coming. -He's jumping! What grace! -Would you dares dive, Fatso? I touched the bottom. -Well done, Tomaz! Where is he? -Is he going to plough the bottom? He's disappeared! Disappeared! What if he's drowned? Boris! Boris! -Well done! -Can I help? Help! I'm drinking water! -You've almost drunk the whole sea! Let's pull him out! His mouth is quite blue. I've almost, I've almost... What? What? -I've almost caught another boot. MY FAMILY IS NO FAMILY You're so dull today. Have you seen her diving as well as me or you? I haven't seen a girl touch the bottom there. And she swims perfectly! She could've competed in a race. With you? What's that? A group of lads on motor-bikes. -What are you doing here? This isn't a promenade. Now take off your shoes and walk on your toes. We're collecting tax! Don't you dare come again! -Go home and play with your toys! Luka! Luka! What are they doing here? I chased them away! They don't seem to be afraid of you. They will be when necessary. Have the shells really vanished? I've heard. Well, people talk. -Do they say I steal them? Forget it. I've reported them missing only once and they make a fuse immediately. Want to come to Piran with me? One, two three and four... We agreed about the places. Come here, in the middle... Once again, the same routine... Three, four. They're really persistent. Yes. My friend Milena is among them. They're training. -They dance well. I'm, going to start dancing too. Milena has already shown me a few steps. Have you been to your father's room? Why? -What kind of program is there in the computer? Don't know. Maybe some old ones that my dad taught me. And what does 'My family is no family' mean? -That's the truth. I've told you I don't like you going there. Good night, Tomaz. -But what did he choose that job in Ljubljana for? -Because, dear, he likes his job better than us. -But why? -Because your father is very stubborn, you see. And you? Would you go to Ljubljana? -Good night. You're both stubborn - but I am too. Tomaz! -Tomaz... -Tomaz... I'm going to throttle her! Let's go to the walls! -Right now! Something terrible is happened. -I'm coming. -Hurry up! That gang from Portoroz again. -We've got to get them for this. It'll be enough if you scream. YOU'RE ALL SHIT! It's like this every time? -We'll have to discuss this problem. Who's going to clean this up? Where's the fire? There's no smoke. Meet at my place. Ask it which girl is Tomaz in love with! Smart ass! -Come on. Let him do it. TOMAZ IS IN LOVE WITH FILIP TOMAZ IS IN LOVE WITH MILENA. I'll switch it off. That was a bit of fun to warm it up. Won't it burn out? We're forgetting the gang from Portoroz! Shall we pelt them with tomatoes? -How about letting air out of their tyres? -I'd sink them in at least two boats! -Figs! A clever idea! -Why? -It suggests sealing figs! Rebus! -The figs of Portoroz! -Not a bad idea! Hurrah! -Let's go! The figs of Portoroz! Hurrah! Vedi didn't know one thing: We're lucky to be early. Hot figs are shit. Not get diarrhoea from them. Quiet! Not so loud! This one is rotten. -Good for 'the ruins'! Well, it's not rotten throughout. -Throw some down! What a fig! You swine! -Shut up! You'll spoil the whole thing! But Filip is pissing! -Revenge! Revenge on the Portoroz gang! -Revenge! Thanks, Tomaz. -Any man would do it for you. I must go to the rehearsal. -I'll accompany you. Going to the movies? -Yes. At eight? -OK Of course he's missing you. I'll call him. Tomaz, your father would like to talk to you. Tomaz, the phone! Can't you see I'm busy? -Tomaz! I can hear you. You don't have to shout. Right. OK... OK, bye! -Wait! Let me say another word. It's cut off. How does one win over a girl's heart? COURAGE They're great! -Now motocross-bikes. Even I would like to ride on them! It can be used in water too. -My aunt once told me... Hey, who's that with Milena? Oh, it's you Tomaz! Hi! Have you been to the movies? Oh, it's you, Tomaz! How are you? Been to the movies? What do you want? -Come on, let's go! Do you want me to buy you an ice-cream? Do you give me to give you a lift? -They wouldn't dare, I guess. -None of them. They think they're big! -Come on, girl. I'll give you a lift! Tomaz! Where are you going? -Let her go! See-she wants to! Shampoo! -What? -You're foaming. -Here we are, princess! Who do you think you are? Let's run! -Such a perfect bike and she let's you down! TROUBLE AGAIN? -Stop it! Didn't we agree that the room stays locked? That's not fair of you. It needn't he like this. It's getting late. What's the matter with you today, captain? -Nothing. You seem to be keeping a secret. -It's nothing. -Come, now, it's obvious. We've got all these sea-shell nurseries thanks to your taker. You can be proud of him. I'd prefer him to be less ambitious. To have more time. To go sailing with me sometimes like we used to. -You miss him, don't you? My mother is not happy about it, either. -Hold on, captain. Don't abandon the ship! Now, turn it off. The second this week. This year's harvest will be excellent. It would be even better if they didn't steal. Pass me the binoculars. The Portoroz gang! They're here again! Could they be the thieves? Luka, have a look! OK, Tomaz. They're just kids. -And who do you think wrote that we've all shit. They steal shells! Have you got any evidence? You can't accuse them just like that. They want to take revenge. You'll see I'm right. Do you want me to help you? -Don't make fun of me. You'll be surprised. -Well, bye! Stop! Got him! -He's all ours. Hurrah! You won't steal our figs. -And piss on us. -Let's punish him! Yeah! -You should be punished for stealing the shells! What are you talking about? -I saw you pulling them out of the water thieves! What a fool you are! Shall we torture him? -Yeah! -Do you surrender? His trousers are torn. He doesn't need them then. Let's undress him! Punish the spy! Into the water! Hold him! The boys from Piran - their leaders. Swim like stones. Like the rocks along their shore. Where? -Try to guess! -At the Punta lighthouse? Yes, at Punta. The boys from Piran are like lemons - they all sink! The boys from Piran aren't alive if they don't drink dung-water! Where from? -The harbour! -The harbour? Of course-where else? Tell your friends we'll meet tomorrow at the salt works! -Greet the people of Piran! Sods! Ten on one. Just wait and see! Run, run... Advertising? -The Portoroz night show. How much are they paying you? Is this the time for coming home? Look at you! I've discovered whose stealing the shells. What happened to your trousers? -l really did! The boys from Portoroz are thieves. We just have to catch them at work. -l asked you something! But mum, l really have discovered the thieves. Stop it with those shells! You'll now see that Luka isn't stealing them. -The last time your t-shirt was full of figs, and today you come naked without trousers! Who cares about the trousers! Will you at least try to listen to me? Hay... And now the whole of Piran is meeting here! There are rumours that the Portoroz boys caught you swimming. -And you're even advertising their town! We'll see who's going to laugh tomorrow. And clean the place after- wards. I must go to work. I had to go through Piran wrapped in this poster. They were stealing the shells. -Revenge! -For the shells! For the trousers! -Vedi is ready! Let's prepare a battle plan! They should've been here! -Let me see once more! Is this dot me? -Leave us alone, kid! We need a volunteer to stand in front of the ship. To be the bait? -Who volunteers? -I'll go! You see that dyke? Climb up it-they must notice you. Doesn't he look silly? -He seems to be full of shit! That's suspicious, lads. Where are the rest of them? We'll fin out soon. Dario, that one is yours. Hurrah! After him! After the Piran boy! I'm from Ljubljana, not Piran! -Hurrah! After him! Now they've seen you running here. -What bait! Leading them right to us. -You're not fit for the front. Come on! Go to the girls! I was good enough to be the bait. -Hey, show yourselves, cowards! Shell thieves! Shell-eaters! -And you're fig-eaters! Polona, pass me a bandage. Got any refreshment for the wounded? Yes, but only for the worst. -Polona, a glass of juice for the wounded. Tomaz, where are you? Stop! Stop! That's enough! Stop! Stop! Boys... Stop! Why are you interfering? -I've discovered who steals the shells. My word honour. Where are the thieves? -I saw them just now. -Who's the thief? I'll show you. Follow me! Seeing you pulling some- thing out of the water we thought it was you. Yes, we pulled out an old useless rubber boat. And you thought it was sea-shells? There they are! -We know why they're camping here. I found this rope there. Yes, it's made of cord. -What are we going to do now? Let's declare war on them together. And we won't beat each together. -Shut up! We're allies now. -Boys, we mustn't tell Luka. We'll surprise him. -The war's on! Shake hands! Vedi, help us! I'm entering data about some guys. They've got motor-bikes. Motor-bikes. -They camp at the sea-shell farm. -Sea-shells. And Luka's shells are disappearing. -Sea-shells. Who's stealing them? The guys on motor-bikes. -Oh, them! Any proof? Follow them! Collect evidence! SALES... HIDING PLACES... First evidence. Search the camp! Look, shells! We found them! GUILTY... GUILTY... You've got the evidence. Prepare the battle-plan. Well done, Vedi! -I'll help you. You can really be trusted. Fish in this bay are getting fewer. No wonder-we take them all to the Aquarium. It's still nice to have one. Are the shells still disappearing, Luka? We already know! May we go sailing for a while, Luka? That means I have to carry them by myself? Who taught you sailing? -Luka did. Doesn't your father know how to sail? He sailed up to Ljubljana. -Are they separated? No, but we're not together. -Grown- ups are so ridiculous sometimes. They're odd anyway-as if they're waiting for someone to bring them together. -Do help them! It's too late at my home. You're special, Milena! -What do you mean? I always sail alone. You're my first crew. Don't forget What. Some beautiful day, There arises in one's heart an unbearable longing the unreachable becomes close at hand and dreams come true. Go with a smile on your face, Hand seeking hand, Eyes meeting eyes, hand seeking hand, Without vows, surrender to the force of the moment. Forget the fears, forget the hopes. It's all now. Eyes meeting eyes, hand seeking hand. Without vows, without promises, Surrender to the force of the moment. Forget the fears, forget the hopes. It's all now. Hello. What's the number of your computer at work? Switch it on, please. That's all I can say for now. OK. Bye! Vedi is ready! Now! Dear husband! I've decided to offer you a truce. Is that you Tomaz? That beauty is my memory of the sea. Can you lend me your binoculars, Luka? Searching for the thieves again? -No, I just need them for no reason at the salt works. Thanks. ... for no reason at the salt works. Hurry up, Tomaz! Be careful. We're helpless without it. Run! How did you... -You called me. Did I? -I got a message that you want to... -What kind of message? That you want me to come. -That I want what? Yes. And that it's high time we settle our affairs. Settle for affairs! Who talks like that? Could it be our snot-nose? He needs you - he's growing up. He's becoming more and more difficult. We'll talk tomorrow morning. I put an end to all my travelling. Now, we're going to... If we want to it'll be OK. Come in! -Good morning! Are we friends again? -Haven't we always been? If that's true, I must say you've managed to hide it very well. You've coped with the computer successfully. Going to the salt works? -Wait a minute? Another surprise for you. The main piece of information. We made a decision overnight. They're waiting for me. Come on, Tomaz! -Let him go. We'll tell him later. The best view is from here. -We'll make our headquarters here, then. My parents got together again... Overnight. -There might be a baby, then you'd be singing lullabies! I'm not so sure. If they see there's no bridge they'll stop dead. Which aunt did you steal it from? -I've got a Polaroid camera and film from aunt Rosy. -Go and find Bojan and shoot whatever he tells you to. Look out! -Clumsy! Attention! Someone is approaching position A! Oh, dear! We've been repairing it all afternoon. Hope it'll be able to carry your weight. One for the enemy is coming! Were you invited to come? -What can we do for you? A photo? Hurry up! -Sure! A muscular pose! It seems they've become friends. I've made such a smudge. Let's begin. Vedi is ready. Check the situation. You, Dali, stronger! You, Dave, stop. Everything's OK till now. -Push AX. The sea-shell operation... -Has it broken down? Vedi doesn't break down. Empty batteries. -What do we do now. We must find some source of energy. Where are they? -By the ropes. They'll come out any moment now. Hurry up! -To the right! Stronger, Dali! It's connected. Start! It works. Well done. Vedi! -Vedi with you again. Check the situation. Attack! What are you doing, bastards? -That's what we want to ask you? What are you doing here? Give me the photo! -Stop it! -Surrender! Sod it! This boat is the end of us. Let's go! Help! I must help them. Vedi they mustn't run away! Quickly, Vedi! Help! Murders! What's up?-They changed direction! They're coming towards us! Get Filip, quickly! Organise the defence! We need help! Help! Tell us what happens if they run away? We need help! You... yourself... Are the solution... I can't help you. You'll win... You've woken up, super detective! -But for five minutes only! It's not time for visits. What happened? -You know, everything was so... The bump has almost disappeared. All's well that ends well. What about Vedi? -It's waiting for you at the salt works. -Broken. I've already found work for the guys on bikes. They'll work. Do you know where? At the Aquarium! I'm not sure if my father will agree. -He agreed. He and mum brought you some figs. I'll leave you to your friends now. At first we... -Wait! Let me tell him! -No, first we beat... -We beat them. I was in hospital once too. With asthma. But I'm well now! -So am I. We can organise a party, then. You'll be the guest of honour! -I'll come, don't worry! This is too much! Where do you think you are? The doctor will be furious is he sees you! You've even got a dog! Out, At once! Come on! I've already closed one eye. What are you waiting for? Go! You be sure come! The smell of pleasure is carried by the wind. Get ready, all of you, dear friends. My merry friends, shall we begin? It'd be best to star right now. Let's start - time's passing. The party can't wait! The party is impatient - everybody knows that. The air doesn't make hunger fly away. We'll play the fool like lunatics. When shall we begin? When shall we begin? Let's start, time passes, the party can't wait. The party's such a gas that doesn't like to wait! What smell is in the wind? The party's on the horizon. The thirsty, the hungry will be fed and drunk. The rested will be tired. The rested will be tired. Let's start, time passes, the party just can't wait! The smell of pleasure is carried by the wind. Get ready, all of you, dear friends. My merry friends, shall we begin? It'd be best to start right now. Let's start-time's passing. The party can't wait! It's such a gas that doesn't like to wait! We are assembled to honour our Vedi, who gave us all his power, knowledge, and unselfish cooperation in all our battles. He also gave us theoretical and practical advice for waging war. Are you crying? -Just happy that Tomaz is OK. -Do you love him so much? I know he's yours. -Silly! He was in love with Vedi, not us. -But Vedi's gone now. And now let's dance! Hi, Tomaz! Coming to help? -I'm not going anywhere! -Tomaz! I wanted to tell you but you didn't listen! You can't just like that! -We're leaving tomorrow! Wait! You came, finally! Where's dad? Tomaz! Tomaz! -He's in his room. Come here! -What's happened? -I'll call Cirila! It's just like asthma attack. He's hardly out of hospital! I was so glad of moving! Leave us alone. How shall we sort this out? What about Ljubljana? -Don't panic! It's nothing. -Is it asthma? No, certainly not. Don't push him. Try the nice way. -Do you think? -You were away. Kids are hard to forgive at this age. If you cared for him half as much as... What about you? Aren't you going to watch Milena? She's in the show. -Leave me alone. -Hiding yourself? You can stay. My folks are out. Have you quarrelled with Milena? -Leave me alone. I'm not here. Tomaz ran away. He had asthma attack. They called the doctor. Ah, it's you? -Anything wrong? -Panic at your home. Serves them right. -If I were you I'd go home. But you're not me. I'm sick and tired of you all! I'm sick and tired of you... Not only you-all of you, understand? -If you really don't care. The world is sad tonight. Who can stand tall and live there, not running away? But he boy who runs away through this moon-lit night will fin himself wandering. A man who runs away from himself Will fall into is own trap his own ambush. A man who runs away from himself Will fall into his own trap his own ambush. Come here. What! Tomaz! Do you like being looked for? You like to feel sorry for yourself. That's why you say you're sick and tired of us. You're a born coward! You're a born coward! What! -Please. -Watt! -You should say please. What is his name. -A silly name. -It should be Please. You mean What Please? -Yes. -Why are you so polite? -Tomaz. Please. Don't want to get pity. I know I have to go. This'll be our day. A summer day that might have been, That might come, a summer day. That might never come, gilded by the sun. The summer day caught in a sea-shell Captured in your heart, hidden in your heart. Listen to the sea-shell, it's caught it nit. Listen to the sea-shell in which summer whispers. It invites you to your ear... -Stop! How to invites you to dream... Tomaz! Tomaz! Tomaz!
