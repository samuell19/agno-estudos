(imposing orchestrated music) (radar beeping) (strange, exotic music) (suspicious, menacing music) (guns fire) (boat motor hums) (loon calls) (crickets chirp) - Galaxy. It's them all right. Let's go. - Okay. - Harvey Ward oughta know it's too dangerous to run guns all the way from Manila to Surabaja. - Yeah, but I guess out boss ain't the only one runnin' guns to both sides down there. This is it, let's go. (speaks in foreign language) (bell rings) (boat motor starts) - [Man] Hey, someone's comin'. Get the boys up. Hey! (speaking in foreign language) - [Gruff Man] Come on, come on! - [Man] Get on the line. (speaks in foreign language) (guns fire) (glass smashes) (screams) (bullets ricochet) (guns fire) (screaming) (speaking in foreign language) - Get those gun crates! Let's go! Come on! (speaking in foreign language) - All right, Gerald! Let's get the Galaxy goin'! Pass that can of gasoline over the rail. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (boat motor starts) (explosion booms) - Consigned to Harvey Ward, Patterson and Company, Pier five, Manila, PI. Lots of luck. Too bad about the Lotus Queen, Harvey baby. - When it gets dark, unload those guns. And your count better match with mine, buddy. (bell rings) (alarm sounds) - Got it. - Yeah? Oh, hello, Steve. Yeah, I swung it. No problems. Pushover. - Ah, real good. You got it all? - You damn rights, I got it all. I'm unloading right now, buddy. - [Steve] Right. Hey listen, chap, this'll kill ya. Mr. Harvey Ward still doesn't have a clue who's doing him. He's asking me up there for dinner and poker. - You gotta be kidding? When? - [Steve] Tonight, late. He's got a proposition. - Such as? - [Steve] Oh, I'll find out. Like the man says, he keeps that kettle boiling. - Well, watch yourself, baby. Let's take Dirk up there tonight and do his waiter act. It wasn't all roses last night, the old boy's gonna find out. Take Dirk. - I already fixed it up. And another thing, you remember Hashimoto, used to be a prison guard in Tokyo? He's back in town again. Still peddling you-know-what, only this time, he claims he's made a sale. - You mean that crock about the Jap general they hung like 20 years ago? The one that was supposed to have buried all that loot in Indonesia during the war? - That's right. - I don't believe it. - [Steve] Well, I'm going to check him out this time, and if I know Hashimoto, he'll be spending what he got for it. So Dirk and me, we'll have a little talk with him. - Well, lots of luck. Hey, Steve? You know you're gonna meet an ex-girlfriend up there tonight, don't ya? - [Steve] Yeah, I know. - Well, don't miss din-din. (traffic honks) (chuckles) (chuckles) (lively, funky music) (applause) (smooth, sensual music) - Confirm the shipment of 400 chest of Java Tea. Payment on deposit for the Central Bank of Jakarta, name of Patterson Company. Your party sounds like a great success. All this humidity and you look Gardenia fresh. I want you to get rid of all those freeloader embassy friends of yours early, I'm having dinner guests tonight. It's business, my love, I want you around. - When I'm around, I have the rights of a hostess. I would like some notice in the say who comes to dinner. I thought we had that understanding. - I would appreciate it if you'd cooperate. (waves lap) (motor idles) - Chuck. Dirk got on for the night. - You'll need these, too. - Do you really believe this junk about this gold in Surabaja? - Well, Steve and Dirk found Hashimoto in Nani's cathouse. Him and two girls shot. Hashimoto tried three times to sell us the general's map along with a fancy dinner ring supposed to fit like a key in a peephole in the gold vault, or somethin' like that, to blow the lid off. - How much loot there's supposed to be, anyway? - I don't know. You're to come up to Ward's penthouse tonight for the party with me. Dirk'll let us in after the party starts. - I guess I'd better change, too. - You'll do. - What's the, uh, new address? - Gray Jack Guerrillas, Surabaja. It seems Colonel Natursian pays more for guns than the commissioner. - Ward missed a good sale. - Yeah. Jerry? I'll meet you at nine. (traffic bustles) (elegant R&B music) - Oh, Ms. Stone, you will excuse me for bringing Joanie, but she was ditched at a previous party. - I understand. (ship horn blows) (ship horn blows) (ship horn blows) (machinery hums) - Remember, you promised me a share in this deal. - Don't worry about it, Jerry. You'll get your share. (whacking) (elegant easy listening music) (flashlight clicks) - Cards, gentlemen? - My pleasure. (ship horn blows) (ship horn blows) (ship horn blows) - [Man] 500 please. (chips clatter) - [Player] Uh, 400. (chips clatter) (chips clatter) (chips clatter) (elegant easy listening music) - Goodnight, gentlemen. - The interesting thing about poker is is the other man bluffing? Incidentally, I thought I was invited here to discuss some proposition. - It'll keep. - They also tell me you never leave this eagle's nest. You haven't set foot on ground in almost two years. (camera clicks) - That's beautiful, Ward, baby. Beautiful. (chuckles) (gasps) You're warm, Ward, baby, you're warm! All you need to know now is a street corner. (chuckles) (easy listening music) - Your taste in dinner guests is deteriorating. Why did you invite that motley group anyway? - Wanted to look them over. I have a deal in mind. We just bought 400 chests of java tea in the name of Patterson, our dummy company. Local custom service is a farce. It was so simple to bring an extra truckload out of the port of Surabaja. - You want to smuggle a single truckload? We have an agent there, let him do it. - Our agent is a Chinese who'd set fire to his mother for two cents. Putting him in charge would be like flushing $40,000,000 down the drain. It's not exactly money. But it is five tons of gold bars, and 10 chests of diamonds and jewelry. Occupation loot from the Java bank vaults. Nobody knows it exists. - Who says it does? - A Jap general. He was commander in chief in east Java during the war. The British sent him back to Japan for war crimes. He died in a jail in Tokyo three months ago. - That went out with Tom Swift and the Rover Boys. I don't believe it. - Well, neither did the Japanese guard. Even when the general gave him some evidence and asked him to help him to escape. - What kind of evidence? - You're wearing it. He gave him 300 US dollars for it. It's worth 15,000. Museum piece. It's also the key to the recovery of the entire cache which is hidden in vault under a swimming pool. He built it during his occupancy of his summer headquarters just outside Surabaja. It's a highly technical operation. I'd go myself, but I don't think their government would like it. - I could. - You could what? - Deal with the plantation people and handle that Chinese of yours. - What makes you think you could pull it off? - I want true security. - It's too risky. You mean too much to me. (rhythmic percussive music) (jet engine idles) - [Captain] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome aboard flight BR100 to Surabaja. Flying time be approximately three hours and 20 minutes. We shall be cruising at the altitude of 20,000 feet. (speaks in foreign language) - The real test of beauty in a woman. How she looks when she's laughing, or when she's asleep. - What are you doing on this plane? - Getting in some flight time. Read about the Japanese they found murdered last night? And two women. You been to Indonesia before, Stony? Stony. - I'm on a business trip for Patterson Company. (gun fires) (buzzing) (picks up phone) - Hello. Yes, yes, it is. Who? But why come to me? No, I don't know what you're referring to. Yes, she is. No. Well, I'll, um, I'll let you know. No, no, you'll hear from me. Right. (hangs up) (speaking in foreign language) (upbeat music) (murmuring) - Ms. Stone, a Chinese gentleman has asked for you. He's waiting in the bar. - I'll call for him after I've changed. - [Concierge] (speaks in foreign language) is number 14. (chiming traditional music) (reed screen rattles) (lightning crashing) - Can I have my key, please? (speaks in foreign language) You know, the key. (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) Thank you, thank you. (speaks in foreign language) (birds chirp) (speaks in foreign language) (sensual music) (thunder crashes) (intriguing music) (knocks) - My name is Ah Song. - I told the desk clerk I would send for you. - I can wait. - Do you understand why I'm here? - Perhaps you want a little help. - I would like to see the high commissioner. Can you get me an appointment with him tomorrow morning? - What for you want to see commissioner? You want to move tea to ship? It can be done. Pay little comsha. Hire some more trucks. About 50,000 rupia. Is okay with you? - We do not care to pay any comsha, Mr. Song, or hire trucks. Now can you get me an appointment with the commissioner or not? - It can be done. Perhaps you should explain a little more. - There is nothing to explain, Mr. Song. - A little more information. - What information, Mr. Song? - You are a very pretty lady. And very smart. But I believe you have not been in the east for a very long time. - My name is Mr. Ah. Not Mr. Song. (tense, tinkling music) (upbeat dance music) - [Chuck] Steve, baby. - I want you to know I ordered her special just for you. - Hi. - Hi. - How goes it? - I'll see the commissioner tomorrow. No problem. (crickets chirp) - (speaks in foreign language) Stone. (speaks in foreign language) Ah Songs says you go to commissioner's office tomorrow morning at 11, please. Okay? You understand? - Yes, yes, all right. (speaks in foreign language) (upbeat dance music) - Let's pour one to the Indo-American Airlines, buddies. (rain patters on glass) (murmuring) - You're late. Eight minutes late, madame. - I'm sorry. - You may go in. - Thank you. (hissing) (tense music) (hissing) (murmuring) - Good morning, Ms. Stone. Good morning. - [Guest] Good morning, Ms. Stone. - [Diner] Good morning, Ms. Stone. - His excellency orders me to say to you to go with him at Krawaton 9:30, please. - Well, anytime, I'm ready. - You're interested in the tea factory? - Just shows you how wrong you can be. I'm also interested in walks in the moonlight. - Really? Not afraid of the boogeyman? - Only his associates. - Good morning. - [Assistant] Sir, Captain Haryan waiting at main entrance. - Ja. - Your excellency, Ms. Stone said I'd be most welcome. - [Commissioner] Certainly, Mr. Blessing. (exotic music) (shouting) (speaking in foreign language) (intriguing, conspiratorial music) - Come, I show you the factory. (machinery churns and hums) Your tea's ready for shipping off the landing docks, madame. - And my transportation? - Oh, there will be trucks, probably this afternoon. - I understood it to be tomorrow afternoon. - Well, if you prefer. - Well, I hate to miss Mrs. Suwono's dinner party. - [Suwono] Surely you were not considering returning to the city with the trucks, Ms. Stone. - Your excellency, it is my responsibility to see these shipments through. - If you insist, Ms. Stone. Although there is the problem of security. The convoy may not be well protected. - I'm not as valuable as your excellency to the Gray Jacks. But in case, if I could possibly borrow-- - Captain Haryan? Yes, I suppose that could be arranged. (thunder rumbles) (canon fires) (guns fire) - Good afternoon, Mr. Commissioner. (speaks in foreign language) I see you're out for an afternoon drive. I must apologize for this inconvenience. My men sometimes lose some degree of discretion as to whom they detain. You're in excellent company, Mr. Blessing. - Oh, thank you, Colonel. I try to keep in pleasant surroundings. - I hope you're enjoying your brief visit to my country, Madame. Does is distress to see people at war? I thought it part of Mr. Ward's policy to keep the kettle boiling, as the saying goes. - I don't know what you mean. - On our last meeting, it was I who was caught in an uncompromising situation as this. And you permitted me to escape. - Well, in the future, I'll have to ignore such an opportunity. - You're free to continue. I'm no longer in your debt. (jeep starts) (bird calls) (sky rumbles) (sky rumbles) - Yellow roses. Love you, can't afford you. I think the monsoons'll break tonight. (sky rumbles) (bird calls) (curious, mysterious music) (chill easy listening music) (party goers murmur) (crickets chirp) (speaks in foreign language) - Get out! - (speaks in foreign language) Ah Song say you come quickly please. He waits to see you. - I said get the hell outta here! (speaks in foreign language) (crickets chirp) (horse whinnies) - Ah Song would like to oblige Mr. Ward. - Now the army will move our tea tomorrow afternoon. A convoy will stop here to pick me up, but I don't want to leave until about an hour after dark, so can you arrange some sort of delay? Now in case those trucks break down, I would like to hire one or two of your trucks from Surabaja to stand by. One of those big ones that carries about five to six tons each. And about 15 to 25 workmen. And I want them here tomorrow night, six o'clock sharp. It'll be very hard work and little time to do it. - No problem. 500 or 600,000 rupia. - I'll pay you when we get to the docks. Now I want those trucks loaded and off the palace grounds within 15 minutes. - No problem. (horse whinnies) (chill easy listening music) (party-goers murmur) - Ms. Stone? - Yes. - I'm Commissioner Suwono. How do you do? Won't you be seated please? - Thank you, your excellency. I was warned to be considerate of your excellency's time. - I understand that you're representing Patterson and Company of San Francisco, are you not? - Yes. - I hope you will forgive my English, I haven't had the chance to use it often. - It's quite all right. - This matter that you're interested in covers the purchase of-- (paper rustles) 300 chest of orange pickle, 100 chest of chi-chong from your factory at Krawaton. This offer was transmitted to us from your agency in Tokyo by cable on the 18th of last month. Is that correct? - Yes, your excellency. - I also understand that you sent us a draft and we cleared it. Your tea's packed and ready for delivery. Exactly why are you and your other ships concerned? - We were informed that the consignment is still at the factory, excellency, 60 miles away, and there's a problem about transportation. - You are quite right, madame. Your teas is still at Krawaton. And these terms of sale here is FOB, so it is our obligation to deliver your tea at the docks. - And when can that be arranged, your excellency? You see, we have cargo space in port, but only for a few days, and we'd be more than happy to pay for the extra expenses for shipping by truck. - I'm beginning to believe that you are very accommodating, madame. - It would be much more expensive for us, If we had to cancel with our customers. (dialing phone) (speaking in foreign language) - Ja. I understand that you're staying at Park Hotel, Ms. Stone? - Yes. - [Suwono] I hope they made you comfortable there. - Well, they try their best. - I'm afraid that Surabaja does not qualify as a summer resort. If you intend to spend your weekend, you'll not have a pleasant time there. Ja. You can have your trucks, madame. The army will provide them at no extra cost. The convoy will be available Monday. - Oh, thank you very much. Oh, do you think we'll have a problem with the rain? - No, no, the roads are adequate. I wonder if I can persuade you to accept our hospitality in Gonoicho. It's rather colder. It's but a few miles away from our factory at Krawaton. - Well, that's very kind of you. I would love to but-- - You have other plans? - No, not really, but are you sure I'm not inconveniencing you? - Not at all. I'll have someone finish business affairs at Krawaton. I'll send my car for you at three o'clock this afternoon. - How can I refuse? - Ms. Irene Stone? Telegram for you. (birds chirp) (car starts) (car starts) - Thank you for being prompt. (conspiratorial music) Don't worry. Nothing to be concerned about. Our people are law-abiding and they support my government wholeheartedly. There are a group of dissidents, religious fanatics, radicals, and even communists. (tense music) (shouting) (conspiratorial music) (shouting) - Excellency. - Ms. Stone, may I present Captain Haryan? This is my personal (speaks in foreign language). - Hello. - How do you do? I'm Margaret Suwono. Would you like to go upstairs to your room? - Yes, I'd love to. (birds chirp) - I hope you'll be comfortable. If you care, Suku can show you around the grounds. - All right. (suspicious, exotic music) (exotic music) (speaks in foreign language) - I want you to meet this gentleman, Ms. Stone. - Oh, we've met, Mr. Commissioner. Hello, Stony. (crickets chirp) - (speaks in foreign language), Blessing. - You're a very lucky man, Commissioner. You have a charming wife. And this magnificent estate, it's beautiful. I wish I could see it all. - I shall consider it a privilege, although we might not have much time since I have arranged for our visit to Krawaton. In the evening, my wife wishes to give a dinner party in your honor and Mr. Blessings. - That's very kind of her. - A lady's graciousness should be recognized, Ms. Stone. So should a man's wholehearted generosity. Mr. Blessing was a transport pilot working for us during the blockade. It was hard work, but he accepted not more than his expenses. - That was generous of him. - Earlier this afternoon, he approached me to my office asking for a favor. One which I did not hesitate to grant. A temporary franchise to fly air freight out of Surabaja. Please excuse me. (sensuous R&B music) - That's a nice dress you're almost wearing, Stony. - How did you get here anyway? - Cab. Gray Jacks are not after me. - Don't be funny. - What's your feelings about accepting hospitality under false pretenses? - So? I lied a little. - Look, doll-- - You know very well that those natives are against everybody who used to deal with the Dutch. Ward isn't the only one who's trying to deal with them through a dummy company. - I'm not talking about any dummy company, I'm talking about you, and I don't like getting chucked for no good reason. Unless there's a prize in it for me. - I thought you were broke. - Oh, come on, doll. - I have a headache, will you make excuses for me? (tense suspicious music) (tinkling, off putting music) (sudden percussive music) (crashing) - Damn, damn, damn little-- (pained grunt) (suspicious music) (party-goers murmur) (smooth chilled out music) (gong chimes) (gong chimes) - I would like to thank you for offering to escort me tomorrow. - I'm very honored that you requested me. (singing in foreign language) (traditional music) (tinkling, off-putting music) (crickets chirp) - Don't make yourself too comfortable. You're not staying. - You fool. Don't you realize this whole bundle could be booby trapped and blow this place to hell? And even if you do get your hands on it, you're bound to foul up somewhere down the line. Do you know what it's like to spend 10 years in an Indo prison? - I wish you'd get the hell out of here. - [Steve] See ya. (door closes) (people murmur) (knocking) - I must talk with you, Ms. Stone. - Come in, your excellency. Won't you have a chair, your excellency? - Thank you. Ms. Stone, may I try to persuade you to extend your stay longer in Surabaja? - I can stay until Wednesday if my tea gets shipped out, but-- - I didn't mean to say just that you remain for just another day or two. Please, I find myself in an extremely difficult situation. I had hoped for a better time and place to propose an arrangement to you. - I'm flattered. Really I am, but-- may I think about it for a day or two? - I have urgent business in Jakarta. With your permission, I shall contact your hotel on Tuesday. (tinkling, off-putting music) (door closes) (smooth easy listening music) - Steve? - Telephone, madame. - Thank you. Hello? - [Phone Man] Ms. Irene Stone? - Yes, this is Ms. Stone. - [Phone Man] Your convoy, madame, is here at Krawaton. - Oh, good. When will it be by to pick me up? - For that I am not myself responsible. Your tea has been loaded up, but it's already late, and they have to make some repairs before they can start it. It may take a long time. Who knows? - Well, that's all right, I don't mind waiting. As long as they get it done. - The officer, he wants to advise you that it would be best to go tomorrow. He doesn't want you to take the risk of the journey after dark. - Tell him I can't postpone it. The ship is supposed to sail tomorrow morning with the tide. - [Foreman] The officer says it's too dangerous for you, madame. - Tell him if he refuses, I will call the High Commissioner in Surabaja and ask for another officer. I'm here all alone with the servants and I'm not about to stay another night. Could you also ask him what happened to Mrs. Suwono and Mr. Blessing? - [Foreman] The officer says that you will be ready please at five o'clock. He says that Mrs. Suwono has gone to see her family, and Mr. Blessing, he doesn't know where he is. - All right, thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. (tinkling, off-putting music) (birds chirp) (tense music) (screams) - [Irene] No! (low, suspicious music) (exciting percussive music) (crickets chirp) (speaking in foreign language) (explosion booms) (birds chirp) (chiming, worrying music) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (crickets chirp) - [Song] The trucks are loaded and ready to join the convoy. (truck starts) - Just what in the hell do you think you're doing? - Comshaw, Stony. Comshaw. - [Irene] Do you mean you bribed-- - Haryan? Sure. But I do have a nice big bird waiting to load that interesting bundle you just scooped up. - Nice big bird for what? - To fly in the air. It's an awful lot of loot we're carrying back there. (speaks in foreign language) From here on, we're on our own. (speaks in foreign language) (tense music) (explosions boom) (guns fire) (speaking in foreign language) (guns fire) (speaking in foreign language) (guns fire) (bullet ricochets) (explosion booms) (gun fires) Get down and stay down! (guns fire) (speaking in foreign language) (gun fires) (guns fire) (gun fires) (explosions booms) Stay down until the Colonel gets fed up and takes off. If he ever does. (guns fire) (guns fire) (guns fire) (speaking in foreign language) (guns firing) (groans) (guns firing) (explosions boom) (explosion booms) (guns fire) (pained grunting) (gun fires) (bullets ricochet) (guns fire) (explosion booms) (guns fire) (speaking in foreign language) (guns fire) (truck starts) (guns fire) (screams) (guns fire) (gun fires) (guns fire) (explosion booms) (guns fire) (explosion booms) (guns fire) (gun fires) (guns fire) (truck pulls away) (crickets chirp) (gun fires) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (tense music) (guns fire) (gun fires) (casual, exhausted music) (calm music) Poor bastard thought we were running guns. - And what's going to happen to me? - You sure as hell can't sail to Singapore and go back to Ward empty-handed. - [Irene] Am I supposed to just vanish from the scene? - Looks like you're going on a plane trip. Oh, I'll get you out of here and back to New York some way or other. No strings attached. (thoughtful, jazzy music) (seagulls call) - If I stay with you? For good, I mean. - Last night, I would have kept the whole load. Today? No deal. There's a reward which I'll split three ways with Chuck and Dirk. We could have a happy life together. If you don't like it here in the east, I'll take you back to New York, Australia, any place you'd like. I can give you everything you need. A couple, three kids. Maybe a whole battalion. (plane soars) (seagulls call) (waves lap) (off-kilter music) (speaking in foreign language) (menacing music) - I expected you in sooner. - I didn't expect to be. Until your friends crossed you and contacted me. - Tell me another, I'm all ears. - Still a naive believer. - Seems I've missed all 'round. You make a cozy family portrait. Why? - Arithmetic. One third of 40 adds up to more than one third of five percent of 40. - You don't think you'll see any part of that answer, do you? (gun fires) (tense, dangerous music) (gun fires) (nefarious jazzy music) Suwono, Commissioner Suwono! Pier 18, Surabaja! (speaks in foreign language) - Ja. (speaks in foreign language) - Pier 18, Surabaja. (tires kick dirt) (ship horn blows) - Get it loaded quickly. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (siren wails) (whistle blows) (gun fires) (gun fires) (screaming) (guns fire) (guns fire) - Ward!

(guns fire) (guns fire) (bullet ricochets) (gun fires) (guns fire) (gun fires) (sudden, tense music) (guns fire) (whistle blows) (shouting) (speaking in foreign language) (gun fires) (guns fire) We could have a happy life together. If you don't like it here in the east, I'll take you back to New York. I can give you everything you need. A couple, three kids. Maybe a whole batalion.
