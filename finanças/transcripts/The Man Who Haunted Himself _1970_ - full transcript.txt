Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK - Goodnight, Tom. - Goodnight, Mr Pelham. Thank you. Thank you. Jim, I think he's gone. What's the matter with the bloody thing, looks as though we've got two heartbeats there now. Ah, that's better. I hope you're not going back to the office too soon. Of course not. Good as new. Goodbye, Daddy. Goodbye, darlings. Michael, will you please go back and finish your breakfast. You'll be late for school... You too, James. Why did we have to have the same sort of car again? I'm used to them. Damned good motor cars... Didn't seem any point in changing. - I'll put that on your tombstone. - What? - Don't forget the seatbelt. - I don't forget things like that... not important things. Like — kissing me goodbye. - Goodbye, darling. - Take care. - Alex. - Sorry... Sorry, Mr Chairman, gentlemen. Traffic, I'm afraid. No, no, we hadn't really started. I was just bringing Pel up to date... apart from saying how glad we are to have him back. So, well now, that's... everybody... There it is then, on the table. Do we merge with Electronics General or don't we? Pel, look... it's quite simple... The offer's there. E.G.O. have made it. They want it— we want it... Just a question of agreeing a statement, I should have thought. - What d'you think, Freddie? - If a merger's right, and we can make it look right, presumably we come out of it smelling like roses... and with a few extra pennies in the bank, eh Hugh? Well, it's in our own best interests. In the best interests of our shareholders. That's what you meant, Hugh. If I'd meant that I'd have said that. Shall I take it, then, that it's the feeling of this Board that the proposed merger with E.G.O. is a forward-looking step for the good of all? It's not quite as simple as that, Charles... I've thought a good deal about it lately... Would you mind if I said my piece? We've all been waiting for it, Pel. The one word I haven't heard mentioned so far is 'takeover'. No... no... no... - A takeover— that's what it is. - Not as I see it. ...a merger. Joint partnership, I'd say. A takeover... However you like to dress it up that's what it is, staring you in the face. - Well, I don't agree, but... - Look at the facts... E.G.O. isn't out to do anybody any favours. Never have been... until recently... ...and since we entered into Marine Electronics we've not exactly set the shipping world on fire. A nice, steady old firm, Freeman, Pelham and Dawson. One or two bright young lads coming up. - Thank you. - But that's... about it... - until recently. - What d'you mean? What have we got recently that they haven't? - You mean our new Marine Automation system? - I mean just that. But that's top secret! Perhaps we only think it's top secret. But how? Alex, how? How do most leaks leak? Through an open mouth. I think this is a very serious allegation... and if Pel can't substantiate it, he should withdraw it. All right, I withdraw it, fine. No... no... I think this whole matter's got to be thoroughly investigated... It could affect our whole bargaining position. Our own security's got to be checked. Perhaps we can probe E.G.O. for any indications that they know of our new system. I know some of their chaps socially... Ashton, for instance. I could chat him up, I suppose. Right. Er, soft-pedal it, though. We still want it to go through. But we've got to know where we stand... Right, thank you, gentlemen. If you ask me, Pel, you're stirring up a lot of trouble about nothing. Perhaps. I hope you're feeling quite fit again? I was a bit worried about you. Walked right by me in Cheapside last week. Last week, B.J.? Wednesday... Cut me stone dead. Anyway, glad you're all right. Silly old sod. I was in Spain last week. If E.G.O. get him they won't need the secret weapon. - Good to see you, Pel. - Thank you, Freddie... Well, I'm going for a swim, doctor's orders. You coming? Why not. We've got it. Great shot, Timothy! Have you clocked David Bailey in the bikini? Oh, d'you know, I think she'd like to point her camera in your direction, - if you'll forgive the expression. - Oh, sure. Pity you're a happily married man... What would you do if she was to give you the old exposure meter treatment? Oh, I'd probably give her F8 at 1000th of a second... Great! Hold it while I check... - What about Ashton? When are you seeing him? - This evening. Give me a call if you get anything out of him. Hold it! Can you move in... some more... come on. - You'll be in this evening, will you? - Yes, we very rarely go out. Oh! I'm sorry. I'd say F4... with a very slow shutter. D'you know this? It's Pel's latest craze. He played it all the time in hospital. Drove the nurses mad. I'm sorry Frank. I've no idea why he's so late... I'm worried about him driving anyway. Thank you, Luigi. - Where are the boys? - Oh, there you are! - Now what does that mean? - Hallo, Daddy. I've done a painting of your car all smashed up. Oh Michael, you're covered in it, can't I leave you for a second? I said you'd be cross. Mummy, has that man gone yet? No, he hasn't... Now, will you both go back upstairs again at once Go on! And wash that paint off, Michael. Has who gone? Frank Bellamy. You asked him for a drink. - I did? - Why didn't you tell me? Because I didn't ask him. Ah, there you are, old love. Hallo, Frank. What a pleasant surprise. What, surprised I'm still here? No, I'm... I'm sorry. Sorry I'm late. You had a drink? Just finished the third, Eve and I have been getting quietly smashed. - Good — then you'll have another. - Oh, no... no... no... I'm off. Can't drink and drive, old love. Well, I'm sorry... what else can I say? Don't give it another thought. It's not often I get a pretty woman to myself! - Keep him guessing, eh? - Yes, goodbye Frank and I'm sorry about the muddle. I must go and hurl the children into bed. Frank I had no idea. It must have gone completely out of my mind. Oh, that's all right, old son. I say, I'm... I'm sorry I landed you in it. You don't want an alibi, do you? - No, why should I? - Oh, just asking. You know I thought after last Thursday you might have.. made it away. What on earth's last Thursday got to do with it? Oh, you are a cagey old sod, aren't you... You don't have to play it straight with me, you know. I was there, remember? ...at the Club. I won't forget that game of snooker in a hurry. Nor the little party we had afterwards... ...but don't worry, old son... prenez garde... prenez garde... You can read until Daddy comes up. - Go and settle them, will you? - Yes, in a minute. Why have you taken up with Frank Bellamy again? I might ask the same of you. - I didn't invite him. - Nor did I. He bores me to tired sobs. You must have asked him. Darling, I'm telling you, I didn't. Frank Bellamy has got mental B.O. Well, why would he turn up here unless you invited him? Probably after you. You seemed matey enough together. - Well I had to entertain him, didn't I? - God, what's that? Cleaning ticket. Well, the bloody pin stuck in my neck... Now look, darling... he says I invited him last Thursday at the Club. Right? Now, just ask yourself... where was I last Thursday... On holiday, right? Not at the Club, right? You sure? Now don't you start. Am I sure what? - Sure he said at the Club? - He said at the Club. Well, don't get at me. I've just had him breathing heavily down my neck for an hour... Read the riot act, will you? Daddy, what lies at the bottom of the sea and quivers? Oh God, not riddles! D'you give up? All right, what does lie on the bottom of the sea and quiver? A nervous wreck! - It's for you. - Ho... ho... ho... I'm coming. Right, books away, lie down, go to sleep... and you, monster... nervous wreck! Sleep tight boys, see you in the morning. It's Alex. Yes, Alex? Don't tell me I stood him up too? Well, did he admit it? Well, what did he say? Tonight? I've just got in... ...O.K. Alex... O.K. - No dinner? - Sorry, darling. Crisis. You mean another crisis? Apart from the Italian one in the kitchen? Charles has called a meeting. Can't it wait until after dinner? No, apparently not. It's pretty important. - Oh dear, I wish to God... - I'll be back soon as I can. Drive carefully. I'll drive carefully. You mean Ashton actually admitted it? You know Ashton... He gave a few clues across and down, and left me to fill in the blanks. But you're convinced? Mm... I'm convinced that E.G.O. know we've made the breakthrough. - I can't believe it. - It's inconceivable. It's top secret. Yes. So there has been a leak. Well, I don't know, I'm getting too old for this jungle... How could it happen, Pel? Come on, Charles. Espionage isn't all James Bond and Her Majesty's Secret Service. Industry goes in for it too, you know. They could be shooting at us right now from across the street... Infra-red film... rifle mikes... ...pick up every word. Look... it's obvious that something's going on... though God know I don't want to believe it... So we have to take decisions. It's inconceivable that there could have been a leak at Board level... So... where could it originate? Research? The Labs? - ...Alex? - Well, that's an obvious guess. If there's a leak... if... then we've got to try and trace it as fast as possible... find out the extent and then plug it... in the meantime, we'll have to play it very carefully. What else did Ashton say, Alex? Well, he plays his cards very close to the chest... He could have a full house or be bluffing on a pair of twos... I have learned one thing, however... E.G.O. have a large tender out at the moment. Who to? Some characters with snow on their boots. Their bid is to supply the Soviet shipping industry with monitoring components. What's the point, then? The point is, dear Tom, that our breakthrough in Marine Automation would be the clincher. Well, if they need us so badly they'll have to up the ante. Once they get us they'll eat us ...with not even a burp. All right, listen... I've always held with certain principles in business... and I do not propose to negotiate any further until this matter's resolved. Their offer will not be put to the shareholders. Alex. If there's been a leak, you and Pel have damned well got to find out how it happened. That you, darling? ...darling? What are all the lights on for? I don't like being in the house on my own. Well, you're not exactly on your own, are you? There's Maria and Luigi and the boys... Who were you going to telephone? The police... I don't know how to shout 'help' in Italian... I'll get your dinner. It doesn't matter now. I don't want it now, I'm past it. Well you'd better go and put it down the Wastemaster then Because if they find it in the morning they're going back to Sorrento. - Oh, screw them. I'll eat it for breakfast. - It's pasta. It'll be cement by breakfast... You know I read in a book it's a sign of middle age when a man starts switching off lights. I am middle-aged. You're just grumpy, that's all, and I'm going to get you something to eat. I honestly don't want anything. Well, you'll have to go down and dispose of the pasta... Don't make a noise, otherwise they'll come out and investigate. Look, if I can't chuck some spaghetti down the bloody sink in my own house I'm going to emigrate. Did you see a car when you came in? Car? What car? A silvery car. It's been outside all evening... ...a beautiful, long, low, silvery car. Well, what's it got to do with us? Nothing... it was just... dreamy. For god's sake! Get into bed and I'll massage your back. - I want to go to bed to sleep. - It'll put you to sleep. Yes, we've heard that before. I'll just massage your neck. It's no good, Eve. I don't want you to make love to me. You're a super girl, you know that, don't you? No, I'm not... I'm an average, grasping married woman. And what am I? You're an above-average, overworked young executive. Who doesn't make love to his wife very often. I didn't say that. I said it for you. It doesn't matter. It isn't that I don't love you. No, I know. We're just used to each other, I suppose. You'd like another baby, wouldn't you? Yes I thought you were worried about your figure. I've got over that. D'you suppose this happens to lots of people? I expect so... ...but I don't care about other people. I only care about us... what's going to happen to us. What is, do you think? I don't know... I only hope that whatever it is, it doesn't last too long, that's all. I do assure you, the decision wasn't taken lightly, Sir Arthur... It was only after very lengthy and protracted discussions that we decided against recommending your offer to our shareholders. Oh I see... Well, I was definitely led to understand that it would be acceptable to your people. I don't know the source of your information, but obviously a Board decision could not be known in advance. Oh no, no, no, of course not. Er, Pelham, I'd like to ask you a question which you may or may not feel you can answer. Go ahead. Were you, yourself, in favour of accepting our offer? I don't think there'd be any breach in my telling you... I was against it. - I thought you said Pelham was in favour? - That's what I was led to believe. Now look, Pelham, let's not close the door completely... perhaps I could persuade my people to improve our offer. Say, another two shillings a share... and a bigger holding in E.G.O... Well, I will, of course, report this conversation to my Board, but... ...quite frankly I think you'd be wasting your time to pursue the matter any further. Ah, maybe, but get back to me as soon as you've discussed it with the Board, will you? - I'll do that. - Right, goodbye. On what basis is our tender to the Russians being computed... - with or without their new process? - With We've got to have it... Mm? Speaking... ...right, I'll be right up. There you are, the Soviet Trade Attaché is in my office now. Pelham is obviously the stumbling block. I can't understand it. What the hell is Pelham playing at? I thought I'd got him in my pocket. Well, my job could depend on landing this contract ...yours too. We'll have to try a little friendly persuasion. Don't involve me. Of course not, Sir Arthur. Yes, Charles, he took it quite well... ...offered to improve the terms. - Come down will you, please? - Straight away. Charles wants us both to go up to Rugby to see if the leak comes from the works end... Research and Development particularly. Alex... Would you say there's anything strange about me? No more than usual. Why? You remember after the Board meeting, B.J. accused me of cutting him dead last Wednesday? - But you didn't get back from Spain till Sunday. - Precisely... Now Frank Bellamy says I played snooker with him at the Club on Thursday. Oh, he's having you on. Hah, you know what a boring old joker he is. Yes, you can say that again. Well, you can always check up at the Club. I might do that. I'm no bloody good at snooker anyway. Good evening, Mr Pelham. Oh, good evening, Bert. You — er— looking for a game? Maybe. I doubt if anyone'll take you on after last Thursday. What a great game that was, sir. Game? What game? Well, with... er... with Mr Bellamy, of course. - You did say Thursday? - Yes, Thursday. You and Mr Bellamy had won a frame each and decided on a decider. Ah! A generous break. How's Eve these days? Fine. Love to see her again. You must come in for a drink. My blue's on... Oh, blast! Bad luck! - When, old love? - Why not... Monday? - About six thirty. - It's a date. You've never played so well, sir. - I wasn't here on Thursday. I was in... - Ah, Pelham, here's the fiver I owe you. What for? I bet you five quid you wouldn't beat Frank Bellamy last Thursday. Did me a power of good to see his pants taken down. Pel! Hello darling. You look quite done in. What is it? - I don't know. It all sounds too preposterous for words. - What does? Oh, I called in at the Club, to check on that story of Frank Bellamy's. Oh, Pel, you didn't take it seriously? - Well, not really, until I went there. - Well, what happened? The marker confirmed that I played snooker with Frank last Thursday. That's impossible... Frank must have put him up to it. What a bore these practical jokers are. - One of the members handed me five pounds. - What on earth for? A bet on the game with Bellamy... Oh, it's really too preposterous. Grown men indulging in these sorts of jokes. I suppose it must be something like that. This is a serious matter, Mr Pelham... - ...Very - That's why we've come up here. We've never had a leak before. We're not suggesting that anyone here is implicated. I think it would be most useful, Henry, if you outlined the way the experiment was organised. The project was to develop equipment for a new monitoring and data-logging system. Slocombe worked on the materials, hardware, etc and Rogers developed the monitoring ware and equipment. Who co-ordinated the work? I did. So, you were the only one who had complete knowledge of the nature of the work being undertaken? That is correct. Thank you, Henry, you've been most helpful. But the cat's still out of the bag. Don't worry. We'll nail him if it takes every one of his nine lives. Come on, we're due at personnel. Bye Henry. - What the hell did they have to go over all that again for? - All what? The details of the experiment. Science doesn't mean a bloody thing to these money boys. But I told it all to him before. He was up here asking questions about ten days ago. Who? Pelham There's been a leak, that's all... Something we were working on, top secret, has apparently got out to a competitor. The firm was making a profit before you invented the thing, so presumably it will again... You can invent something else and be more careful next time. Yes. I don't care about 'the business'. All I care about is you and me. ...unless, of course, you've invented something to hold a marriage together. Like another baby, I suppose. Anything else, sir? - No, just the check please. - Very good, sir. What d'you want to do now? Go home, or what? No, I don't want to go home. I want to enjoy myself for once. What does that mean? Oh, anything... gamble... ...I'd like to do something reckless like, lose five pounds in one mad spin of the wheel... ...anything to stop us being so bloody dreary and suburban. All right then, let's go upstairs. Will you play too? No, I'll watch... One gambler's enough in any family... ...especially a suburban family. Faites vos jeux, mesdames et messieurs... faites vos jeux. Rien ne vas plus Trente six rouge, pair et passe. You can't win in the long run... ...suppose I shouldn't say that as the manager... It's a disease, you know. Take Mr Martin over there... Nice man. Always loses steadily... Always come back to the table for one last bet. Has to have that last one, then he can go home... Rien ne vas plus. Vin cinq, rouge impair et passé. I'm sorry, that's mine. I won that. I'm sorry, I did... ...I'm sorry. Apparently, madam, the croupier says he placed the bet himself... Final cinq... I'm so sorry... Thank you for supporting me... Cash those in for me. I'll get my wrap. - Oh, hello, Eve darling. - Oh, hello, Frank. The old boy's striking it rich again. Two nights in a row. What does that mean? Ah! Oh, good old Frank puts his foot in it again, ha ha... ...Well, I thought he must have told you of his fantastic win last night. Why don't you get lost, you bloody great overgrown schoolboy. We're tired of your damn silly jokes. Not so lucky tonight, sir. I haven't been playing, that's my wife's. You didn't tell me you were married. At the swimming pool? Should I have done? Oh, not then, but I never did ask you, did I? I don't suppose I'll see you again. No, we've had the wedding photographs taken. Well, call me if you change your mind. What did she say? Nothing. Nothing important... Here... your winnings. Well, we must do this more often. Why bother to cook up all these fantastic lies about Frank Bellamy? They are not lies. If you want to go out gambling and womanising on your own why don't you say so? Because I don't and I didn't. Don't shout, you'll wake the children. I have not been in that club since we were there together six months ago. Well, you seem on very intimate terms with the customers. For God's sake Eve, I've told you, she came up and mistook me for somebody else. It's as simple as that. What d'you want me to say? That I'm seeing her in office hours? It's possible. I don't know what you do. I just work hard, that's all. Well, so do I, and I'm sick of it. Sick of this house and sick of pretending that everything's fine. If you want other women you can have them. Eve... I don't want other women. Well, you certainly don't want me... It's the boys' half-term. I'm taking them home with me in the morning. It'll give you a chance to see all you want of her. How many bloody times do I have to tell you. I've never seen her. Morning, Philip. Good morning, Mr Pelham. Are you going to be long? How do you mean, sir? Well, before you can do me. Do you, sir? My hair. But I did your hair yesterday, Mr Pelham. Yesterday? But my appointment was for today. Excuse me sir. Yes, sir, but if you remember you rang up yesterday and asked if I could take you then instead. Does my hair look as if it's been cut? You didn't want much off sir... Well, I can take a little more if you'd like. No... ...no, it doesn't matter... ...I, er... I must have forgotten. Ah, here's your hat and umbrella, Mr Pelham. Oh... sorry, sir. I... er... I thought... Wait a minute... Did I give you those? Well, I thought you did, sir... ...about an hour ago. Pel... you look as if you need another drink... I thought you'd gone down to play snooker. Where is he? - Is he here? - Is who here? Where are you? What have you come back for, Pelham? Made me miss my shot. Who are you? Pel! Come on! I wondered what had happened to you... Finish your drink and we'll get some lunch. The afternoon mail, Mr Pelham. - Thank you. - Tea? Yes please. Miss Bird... Have you noticed anything strange about me lately? Since I've been back? - Strange? - Odd... Strange. Unlike my usual self? Oh no, Mr Pelham. You're always the same. The girls say we could set the clocks by you. Do they indeed. I'm going out. - What about your tea? - To hell with it! Ah, good afternoon, sir. I believe this was bought here. Ah, yes... I remember you buying it quite well, sir. Me? Oh yes, I remember it particularly... When I told you it's believed to have once belonged to Lady Hamilton you replied... 'How very appropriate'. Rather tickled me, sir. Really... - Did you send it? - Oh yes sir, as instructed. - Oh, anything wrong, sir? - No... No... Perhaps you could tell me who you sent it to? I've forgotten which particular lady. Really, sir? Ah yes, here we are... A Miss Julie Anderson, 47 Cheyne Street, Chelsea sir. As you can see, I was expecting you... Well, you'd better come in. Go on in. Fix yourself a drink. That was a give-away, wasn't it? Having your record on? I should have known, shouldn't I, that you'd be married... You're a sod... like all men... ...but a better-looking sod than most Look, be fair, I didn't make a scene last night... that rates nine out of ten for good behaviour. You're clever, I'll say that for you. Thank you sir, she said. Who put you up to it? - Put me up to it? - That's what I said What on earth are you talking about? - Listen, just tell me the name. - What name? What are you talking about? Let go of me! Is it blackmail? Is that why you faked the photograph? And bought the record? - You bought the record! - I bought nothing! I didn't buy that jewellery and I've never been in this house before. - Get out of here! You're mad! - Now listen to me, listen! I— I saw you for the first time at the pool that day. That was the first time. I thought you were a very attractive girl. The sort of girl I might fall for if I weren't married. But I am married. It's not a brilliant marriage and I'm not a brilliant husband... but I have a wife and two kids... and I want to know what's behind all this. And I suppose you didn't sleep with me, either? - Do what? - Sleep with me! In there... ...on that bed... you made love to me four nights ago... You stayed until three in the morning... and the next day you sent me this... So don't you ask me what I'm up to! Get out... Go play your sick jokes on someone else. Get out, before I call the police. But none of that's true... I didn't... I swear to you I didn't. Get out! Pel, I... Oh, sorry. O.k. Alex, come in. Are you feeling all right? Yes... I just didn't fancy lunch, that's all. You're letting this stupid business get you down, you know. Have you heard from Eve? Yes, I've spoken to her on the phone. Have you convinced her that you're not leading a double life? Hope so... How can I give her any rational explanation when I... ...don't have one myself? But she's coming back? Yes, at the end of the week. The boys have to go back to school. Good... I've, erm, I've just come back from lunch with Ashton... They don't seem to understand our refusal... Oh? - Did you get anything about the leak? - Not a thing. He seemed obsessed by the fact that you'd... misled them. Me misled them? What the devil's he talking about? I don't know... He seemed quite insistent... Why don't you go and see him? See him? You bet I will! - Ah, good to see you, Pelham... sit down, cigar? - No, thanks. I think you owe me an explanation. Of what? Of why you suggested to Tony Alexander that I had misled you over my attitude to the takeover. Well, you must admit things haven't gone... quite as we'd planned. What the hell do you mean? Well, things haven't gone... quite as we'd hoped, have they? - We'd hoped? - Yes... I thought we understood each other, you and I. Understood..? What are you getting at? Do I have to remind you of our previous conversations? ...three in all. You do indeed... I've no recollection whatsoever. None. No? You don't recollect your somewhat whimsical suggestion as to where for security reasons we should have our first meeting? Since we are to set the electronics industry ablaze, you said, - how about... - The Monument it commemorates the starting place of the Great Fire of London in 1666. Not many people know that. This cloak and dagger stuff is all very well, Pelham, but come to the point... what are you offering? What do you think? You've made it, the breakthrough? It'll revolutionise the system. Costs will be halved... efficiency up thirty per cent. Really... Our second meeting was even more way out. You can carry your Board? Naturally I can. - And for yourself? - Managing Director. - Of E.G.O.? - Of course. - What else? - Fifty thousand a year. - Is that all? - No... Thirty thousand E.G.O. preference shares. My dear fellow, you're asking for the earth. Ladies and gentlemen Welcome to the London Planetarium. - Sssh! - Welcome to the London Planetarium. The Earth and the stars... Thousands upon thousands of suns... ...and the nearest our sun ninety-three million miles away... and the Earth... ...a tiny speck in space... ...and man, a speck upon the speck... Thirty-five thousand for the first year. Plus the M.D.ship... Fifty thousand by the end of the second. - Agreed... shares? - Thirty thousand 'B'. - Non-voting? You must be joking. - I never joke. For a man who never jokes you're a bundle of fun. Now look, Ashton, I don't know what this is all about, what you hope to gain by discrediting me but if you repeat one word, one syllable, of this preposterous Alice-through-the Looking-Glass fairy story, I'll slap a writ on you for defamation of character and believe me, I'll ask such damages you won't even be able to afford your taxi fare back from court. One thing before you go, Pelham... - It's been agreed. - What has? The shares... the thirty thousand preference you specified. Get me Alexander. Ashton phoned me himself... immediately after his meeting with Pel. I've never heard anything so preposterous in all my life. Are you suggesting that Pel's been playing a double game? I'm afraid so... I think this extraordinary story of his about someone going around impersonating him is... simply something he's invented as a sort of cover-up. I refuse to believe it. Ashton stated categorically that Pel had been in negotiations with him. They're trying to blackmail him into going ahead with the merger. If a slander like this got around, Pel would be finished... ruined. Yes, that's what they're after. He would have to resign. If that's what they're up to, Pel should slap a writ on them... Ashton's story is a clear slander. - Unless it's true. - I'm convinced it's not. - Then how could they hope to get away with it? - This business of Pel's double... Mightn't this be a bit of Ashton's work? You mean if Pel went for him in court, Ashton could plead that it was a case of mistaken identity? Exactly, and that's why he's been creating all this evidence of the existence of Pel's double. Then they must actually have got hold of someone who is Pel's spitting image... Is that likely? - Pel believes it. - Well, I'm afraid it's all too damned outlandish for me. Then we're left with only one alternative... Pel's guilty. - Mr Alexander in? - I'm afraid he had to go out, Mr Pelham. - I've got to see him. - Well, he'll be at home this evening. Fine. Call my home. Hullo... Oh, Mr Pelham here. I won't be in... Yes, sir. What name shall I say? - What do you mean? - I say what name shall I say? I know you did. What the devil did you say it for? I'm afraid I do not hear you very well... I will get Mr Pelham if you wish to speak to him... But please to give your name. My name is Pelham... I rang... Luigi... has anyone...? ...I mean... are there any messages for me? A man... he did ring up, sir. - Who? Who? - Well, there was, how you say - confusion... about the name. - Well? I was going to get you, sir... ...when he put the phone down. You were going to get me? Si, senori. You were in your room. When was this? Just before you went out. - Went out, you say? - Yes, sir... A short time ago. Did you see me go? No, sir. I was in the kitchen with Maria. I heard you cross the hall, then the front door go... bang. Thank you, Luigi. Same collar... Same tie... Both exactly the same... ...the same as I'm wearing now. But thousands of businessmen wear that kind of stiff collar. Of course they do I have one for every working day of the week. The tie's not all that uncommon. Of course it isn't, but don't you see... Each night when I get home from the office, I take off this. I get into something more comfortable a sweater, a scarf, like you... And every morning, I put on a clean stiff collar... but always the same tie. Well? I arrived home this evening... ...after that phone call to Luigi... and found this on the bed. Couldn't it have been the collar you wore yesterday? That went to the laundry this morning... I only have one of these. I wear the same tie to the office every day. Well, you're certainly a creature of habit. How do you account for the phone conversation with Luigi? He asked me my name so that he could fetch Mr Pelham to talk to me... then when I got home he... was surprised to see me. Swore he'd... heard me in my room a few moments earlier. Pel... ...have you seen your doctor? This morning. Well? He talked to me just like you... Nice and soothing. An old nanny's voice... just before you're going to bed... just before the lights go out. Afterwards, in the dark... you haven't got anybody to listen to... - ...all you've got is yourself. - Well, what did he say, Pel? Who? The doctor. Oh, he said there was nothing wrong with me physically... - But... - But what? He suggested I saw a psychiatrist. I think you should. - Why? - Well, you must admit it's a pretty tall story. He might be able to help you. - Well, that's certainly more than you bloody well do. - Pel! Don't worry, Alex I can work it out for myself. Well, Mr Pelham... we seem to be faced with several alternatives, do we not? First of all there is the possibility, however unlikely, that... ...there is an actual double dogging your footsteps. If that is the case then I can be of very little help to you. - But, er.. could there be another explanation? - There could... ...there could. Have you ever heard of 'illusion des sosies'? 'Illusions of doubles'. That's how the French psychiatrist, Capgras, describes this... clinical condition. 'Sosies'. French for 'double'. But how does it affect me? You could be suffering from this sort of psychosis delusion of doubles. - I could? - Yes, indeed... Misidentification with a familiar person in this case, yourself - is a classical symptom in these cases. - Is it? I have a patient in hospital who suffers from this delusional misidentification. Every time his wife comes to visit him... he claims she is not his wife, but resembles her as a double. Interesting, eh? Then I have a woman patient... who claims her son is not her son, but a double who has done away with her son... Delusional misidentification. It's... quite a common schizophrenic symptom. Then you think I'm mad? No... Such emotive words... ...do not figure in the modern medical dictionary, Mr Pelham. - But that's what you mean. - Not at all... Yours does not seem to be a classic case... there is one important difference. What? That you do not claim to have seen the double yourself. Other people have. - Is that important? - It could be. Mr Pelham... I'd like you to come into my clinic for a few days for exhaustive tests. We cannot rule out the possibility of some physical brain malfunction due to your accident. But the doctors said there was no damage. Nevertheless, I would like to make my own tests... and give you some psychotherapy. Just for a few days. I don't know... I'll have to think about it. Very well, Mr Pelham, if you wish me to help you let me know. That is my card. Ring me, day or night, if you decide you need my help. I will, thank you, Doctor Harris... but I'm sure there must be some rational explanation. There must be. I have to find out... I have to... Hallo children. We didn't expect to see you till Saturday, Mrs Pelham. The children wanted to see their father before school starts again. Mr Pelham telephoned, signora; he will not be home till late. I see. Oh, it's you again... What have you come back for? Well... come on in you can't stand there all night. Huh, you are funny... you're never the same man twice. What did you come back for? I... er.. - I wanted to talk to you. - Talk? Why now? You've only just left. - Left? - I mean you've only been gone two minutes, Gone? Two minutes...? You mean I was here? Actually here, with you? Of course... here with me. I don't remember being here - I don't remember. - What d'you mean? What is it? Is all this true? All these times I've been coming here sleeping with you? You don't remember? None of it. It's not possible... it's not possible. Are you sick or something? - Help me. - Oh darling, what's the matter? - I'm drowning. - What can I do? - Aha... telephone... telephone this number. - Yes, of course. Who is it? Just ring, it's a doctor. What shall I say? Tell him to come and fetch me. These drugs will help us, Mr Pelham. Now we can often probe deeper, in a few days... ...than we used to do in months or even years. You won't know very much about what's happening to you in the next few days... ...by the end of it, I'll know more about you than you do yourself. Who is it? Oh God, you frightened me. Why didn't you say it was you, Pel? Mr Pelham. Good morning, Miss Bird. You gave me quite a shock. I didn't see you come in. - I was in bright and early. - You said you'd be away for a few days, I... I didn't expect you. I've been summoned by the Board. To account for my misdemeanours, no doubt. Oh, Mr Pelham! So if you'll bring in the correspondence, Miss Bird, I'll have time to deal with it before the meeting... ...whilst you make me a cup of your delicious coffee. Yes... yes of course, Mr Pelham. This is perhaps the most unhappy moment of my professional career. but allegations have been made and it is only proper that Pel should have the opportunity to answer to them, here, before this Board. It would be nice to think, Charles, that business today is the simple, gentlemanly affair you still seem to believe it to be It's not, I'm afraid. Before we consider the ethics of the matter, we want to know the facts. Do you deny Alex's allegations? Of course not. Do you mean to say, Pel, that you admit having these secret negotiations with E.G.O... while you were opposing the merger here.. with your own Board? If I hadn't... you'd have happily closed at a ridiculously low figure. I've nearly doubled it for you. By disclosing the company's most secret information? That's what they are paying for. But supposing the deal hadn't gone through. They'd have known we had it. I made sure it did go through... at the right price. Something in that. But Pel! What I don't understand is why you had to go about it in such an underhand way? If I hadn't stood out against you here, the first price would have been accepted. We had to turn it down, don't you see? But you'd already told them about the new system. That's what made them so determined to get us. I must say, I'll be glad to get out of it all. You're right, Pel... Business is an alien world these days. Alien world or not, Pel's got a damn good deal out of them for us. Pel... You know how worried I've been about all this business. The allegations I've made against you were because I couldn't understand your behaviour. Now I know your motives I owe you an apology. I think we owe him a vote of thanks. I think it's just as well there's no place for me in this new set-up. I'm afraid I can't accept this modern business concept that the ends justify the means. I'm sorry, Pel... You and I have been friends and colleagues for more years than I care to remember... ...but I don't recognise the man sitting there. Don't tell me it's this double of yours, Pel. I'm afraid that's a mystery that still has to be cleared up. However, I can assure you, Charles, that the only Harold Pelham... ...is the one sitting here. - What have you found out? - Hm... ...you won't remember much about the past few days, Mr Pelham. But... I think I now know quite a lot about your problems. Mr Pelham, we are all, in a sense, more than one man. Different and often conflicting aspects of our character are constantly fighting for supremacy. We must try and resolve that conflict. You are a man of... rigid habits. Almost puritanical in the strictness of your principles ...both in business and your private life. This may not be apparent in your outward demeanour... ...but it is manifest at its most extreme in your rejection of sex. Even with your own wife. - It wasn't always like that. - No... I believe that basically you are a sexual man. A man who enjoys life, who has, shall we say... panache. But you have fought against this... in the way you dress, the sort of car you drive... ...the life you live. I would like you to release this other side of your character. The, er... man who likes to show off, a bit... to dress colourfully... to enjoy, without guilt... ...all the pleasures of life. Oh come on, one more! No. I'm going to take you home. I don't want you cracking up on me again. Besides, there's another reason: ...our new toy. You told me you hadn't seen it. - Seen what? - The car like this I told you about. I must have second sight. Well, you're going, Mr Pelham... I hope we've been of some help to you. I hope so. Your immediate reaction to these phenomena could be most important. Should anything occur again I want you to phone me immediately... day or night. - Very well, Doctor. - Oh... I don't like the look of all that. - Of all what? - Your clothes... ...the bowler hat and the umbrella and your er tie and starched collar. These things symbolise all that we want to get rid of. Be yourself, Mr Pelham... don't be a slave to convention. Yes, Mr Pelham? Will you... come in, Miss Bird? Yes, Mr Pelham? What's this? Why, the, er, E.G.O. letter you dictated after yesterday's Board meeting... ...confirming that their offer had been accepted. Is there anything wrong with it? What's the matter? Are you ill? Can I get you something? Yes, get... my home, please. Certainly. Oh, there is one other thing, Mr Pelham. Will you be taking me with you? Taking you? When you go to Electronics General as Managing Director. We'll... talk... in the morning, Miss Bird. Get me my home, please. Hallo... Hallo, who's that? This is Pelham speaking... who's that? No... no, I... I... I... I... I'm Pelham. I... I... I'm speaking from my office... - Who are you? - I've told you. I'm Pelham. But I'm Pelham... I am! There's no need to shout. Your name may be Pelham, but I am Harold Pelham of Freeman, Pelham and Dawson. Let... let... let me speak to my wife. Your wife! What on earth would your wife be doing here? Well... well... be— because — I — we live there. Get off the line unless you want trouble... ...just get off the line! Get Dr Harris to my house at once! Certainly, Mr Pelham. Who is he? Where is he? I want to see him. What is it, Luigi? Who on earth are you? Who are you? I'm... Pelham. Oh, it's you I told you about the phone call just now, Alex. Yes. Alex... Tell him... Go on, tell him, you know me. You must know me. But this is Mr Pelham... What do you want with him? I'm Pelham... I am Pelham! Don't shout. Shouting will get you nowhere. Look at that tie, Alex... Have you eve seen me wearing a frightful thing like that? Never. - Have you, Luigi? - No, sir. But... I only bought it today, I wanted to be different. We're not interested in your sartorial taste... Remember all this, Alex, if eventually there is a police case. Police... I'll go to the police. - Daddy... Daddy... what's happening? - What's going on out here? Who on earth is that? Eve... ...it's the fellow who's been impersonating Pel. Eve... you know it's me. How did he get here? What does he want? That's what we're trying to find out, darling. It's a conspiracy... You're trying to drive me mad I am Pelham... I am Pelham! - Mummy, I'm frightened. - Daddy... who is he? - Why does he look like you? - I'll tell you later, son. - Make him go away. - Take them away, darling. - Eve, Mike, Jamie. - Go with them, Alex. You may go too, Luigi. You made a mistake about that tie. I could have been seen wearing it, but didn't. ...and that suit... ...The City expects certain conventions, you know. Why have you done this to me? Don't you see? Don't you yet see? I am you. You died on that operating table... ...for a few moments you actually died... That let me out... Unfortunately you came to life again... So now there are two of us... It can't go on, you know... One of us'll have to go. For Christ's sake! Who are you? Who are you? I've just told you... I'm Harold Pelham of Freeman, Pelham and Dawson. Now I'm going to phone the police. No... no... I'm going to the police. I am... I am. Mr Pelham! Mr Pelham! Mr... ...Pelham...
