Just a couple more things... ﻿Then well go home. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Kids, behave! ﻿Third time shopping this week? ﻿I’ve got eight kids, praise God. ﻿Sweetie, we're going home soon. ﻿We should look at the good things. ﻿Shabbat is coming soon. ﻿I shouldn't complain, ﻿but surely you understand my troubles? ﻿Let me get you a fresh one. ﻿It looks fine. ﻿Why are we selling ﻿this unwashed lettuce? ﻿You're such an extremist. ﻿It's not worth it. ﻿We earn no profit ﻿on the pre-washed stuff. ﻿This has no rabbinical approval, ﻿it could have worms. ﻿Are you kidding me? ﻿You’re late for work. ﻿You forget to mop the floors. ﻿The customers complain. ﻿Now it's the lettuce? ﻿People can wash it on their own. ﻿…but the Ruv insists. ﻿Start acting like a mensch, ﻿then you can tell me about the Ruv. ﻿For now, don’t bother ﻿me about the Ruv. ﻿These rabbis who outlaw eruvin. ﻿They’re meddling with our traditions. ﻿He doesn’t allow women to wear wigs. ﻿Exactly. Don't change our traditions. ﻿You know what I say? ﻿I’m not talking about Jewish Law, ﻿but carrying on Shabbat doesn’t smell good. ﻿I’m serious. ﻿Landau, who stopped being observant... ﻿They threw his kids out of school. ﻿Yankel might be a heretic, ﻿but why punish his kids? ﻿Maybe this brings him back into the fold. ﻿But his wife is still religious. ﻿We can't have these kids in our schools. ﻿But the kids are not at fault. ﻿How was your meeting with the lady? ﻿Praise God. ﻿Chana's father said it didn't go well. ﻿I’m just not ready yet. ﻿"All beginnings are hard," ﻿the Talmud says. ﻿Think about your son's well-being. ﻿He should be raised in a proper home. ﻿Why can’t I raise Rieven on my own? ﻿Why must he live at Eizik’s? ﻿A stepmother won't be any better. ﻿She wouldn't be permitted ﻿to touch my son. ﻿You must find a new wife, ﻿she will run your household, ﻿she'll keep your home clean. ﻿It will be a fine, pious home. ﻿Then Rieven may live with you. ﻿It won't be the same. ﻿It will never be the same, ﻿yet life must go on. ﻿Dad? ﻿Get in! ﻿I’m late to see my tutor. ﻿Just for a minute. ﻿I got you a gift. ﻿Just for a minute. ﻿I got you a present, come inside. ﻿What’s the present? ﻿A chick! ﻿Like the Yom Kippur chicken. ﻿Sleep my child, my chickeleh. ﻿Tomorrow we'll have you ﻿in the chicken... ﻿soup. ﻿You’ll make everyone jealous. ﻿Daddy? ﻿I thought you’d never find me! ﻿It stinks of fish in here. ﻿Like Jonah inside the whale. ﻿You could get into worse things. ﻿Jonah didn’t work for my manager, Shmiel. ﻿Come on. ﻿So what's new? ﻿Why don’t my uncle and teacher like you? ﻿Who’s been telling you this? ﻿We all get along fine. ﻿Don’t worry about what your uncle thinks. ﻿Only what you think. ﻿Promise? ﻿Promise. ﻿Why don't you wear a hat and coat ﻿like everyone else? ﻿You’d look much nicer. ﻿You don’t like the way I look? ﻿If there’s something ﻿you don’t understand, ask me ﻿not your uncle. ﻿- What else is doing? ﻿- I’m getting hungry. ﻿Your tutor called in a panic. ﻿You think this is a free world? ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿You need to go straight home after school. ﻿Sorry, Uncle, he surprised me. ﻿I just picked him up on the way. ﻿Grab your bag and let’s go. ﻿I won't deal with this. ﻿When we make a plan, ﻿we stick to it. ﻿My family is doing you a favor. ﻿Don't forget that. ﻿So you follow Rabbi Moshe or Rabbi Yaakov? ﻿Yaakov. ﻿My family’s always been close with the Ruv. ﻿My uncle was his gabbai. ﻿I couldn't follow the other one. ﻿I can’t believe he permits women to drive. ﻿It’s just not normal. ﻿Must the rabbis meddle in everything? ﻿So the matchmaker says you have children? ﻿- One son. ﻿- Only one? ﻿Ready to get married again? ﻿I was told you've been widowed ﻿only four months. ﻿You've been a widower for a year, right? ﻿I think it’s time for both of us. ﻿Besides marriage and kids, ﻿what else is there? ﻿I’m in no rush. ﻿Why waste my time then? ﻿The Ruv’s been pressuring me to go out. ﻿But I don't think you're my type. ﻿Your type? ﻿And you're all I’d pray for in a husband? ﻿Now I know why Hasidic men are so helpless. ﻿Your mothers spoil you ﻿then your wives take over. ﻿I offer you the opportunity ﻿for a stable life, ﻿you spit in my face. ﻿Did you want to get something to eat? ﻿Was school any better today? ﻿ ﻿But there’s still too much homework. ﻿How much homework? ﻿I’d rather be with you at the store. ﻿That's nonsense. ﻿You? Work at the store? ﻿—You’re young, you have no responsibilities. ﻿Be grateful you’re free to study. ﻿Poor you… ﻿eating Aunt Henchi’s cooking every night. ﻿It’s awful. ﻿She only cooks kugel and chicken. ﻿Let’s stop on the way ﻿and get some schnitzel. ﻿You can’t be more careful? ﻿Look, it’s dripping all over you. ﻿It’s not a joke, don’t laugh. ﻿Look at this, that's a new shirt. ﻿Ruveleh, have you eaten? ﻿We bought a snack on the way. ﻿Smells delicious in here. ﻿What are you making? ﻿Kugel. ﻿Hello Eizik. ﻿What's going on? ﻿You're half an hour late. Where were you? ﻿He was hungry. I bought him a snack. ﻿I wanted to talk to you about next week... ﻿the memorial for Leah. ﻿You’ll make it on time? ﻿I’ll prepare something to say. ﻿Don’t worry about that. ﻿The Ruv’s going to be here. ﻿Maybe I’ll buy Rieven a new suit. ﻿You still owe me money... ﻿from the last time you bought him clothing. ﻿Now you want to buy him a suit? ﻿With whose money? ﻿I’m not an outsider here! ﻿I should be the one hosting the memorial! ﻿Don’t yell. The family’s here. ﻿Calm down. ﻿You’ve never respected me, ﻿even when I was married to your sister. ﻿You have no respect for yourself. ﻿Why should I respect you? ﻿I’m taking my son. ﻿I don’t need him raised in a home ﻿where everything is so strict. ﻿I’m his father. I know what’s best for him. ﻿What do you know? ﻿Enough! ﻿Let’s ﻿It’s my responsibility to raise Rieven! ﻿I’ll be letting the Ruv know! ﻿I don't care. ﻿Wake up ﻿It’s eight o'clock, we're gonna be late. ﻿Daddy, what do you have to eat? ﻿You have nothing ﻿Want some gefilte fish? ﻿We don’t have time. ﻿There’s a piece of cake. ﻿Put it in a plastic bag. ﻿Daddy, you're always making us late. ﻿Where's my tzitzit? ﻿- Soda is good? ﻿- Yeah, it’s good. ﻿We need to hurry up. ﻿Quick! Quick! ﻿Okay, say the blessing. ﻿Blessed are you… ﻿Quick, it’s late! ﻿We need to feed the chick. ﻿Here's something. ﻿Hurry! ﻿Come on, let’s go. ﻿Do you have everything? ﻿There's someone at the door. ﻿Look, it's just business. ﻿You get me? ﻿I have to take him to school. ﻿I’ll be right back. ﻿Come on. Menashe. ﻿I’m gonna pay you. ﻿I just need a check. ﻿And I need it to go through. ﻿Give me two days. ﻿I figured you were at yeshiva... ﻿We need a rabbi with your smarts. ﻿I had to take my kid to school. ﻿Mop the floors tonight. ﻿It won't happen on its own. ﻿ ﻿You heard what the Rabbi said. ﻿The Ruv can’t stop me ﻿from attending college. ﻿Wait until your father hears this nonsense! ﻿Does he contribute at all? ﻿No, I take care of the bills. ﻿Praise God, ﻿the real estate market is strong. ﻿I can’t understand Menashe. ﻿My brothers took care ﻿of our sister while she was ill. ﻿We took her to doctors… ﻿for all her treatments. ﻿I never get any thanks. ﻿Thanks? For what? ﻿You don’t even attend minyan! ﻿You see how he speaks to me? ﻿He's never respected me. ﻿Respect? ﻿This is how you dress? ﻿Where’s your hat and coat? ﻿He's inconsiderate to everyone. ﻿Enough! ﻿Sit down. ﻿Why are you so late? ﻿I had to help ﻿the Hispanic guys ﻿stock the shelves. ﻿See this? ﻿A fresh excuse. ﻿What if he has to pick up ﻿his son after school, ﻿but his boss needs him to stay later? ﻿My boss is terrible, ﻿but I can't afford to lose my job. ﻿This is why Rieven ﻿can’t live with you now. ﻿The Talmud says three things ﻿bring a man peace... ﻿A nice wife, ﻿a nice house, ﻿and nice dishes. ﻿The gentiles have broken homes, ﻿and so they have a broken society. ﻿Do you have so little faith in me? ﻿Do you have so little faith in the Torah? ﻿I’m begging you, Ruv. ﻿I barely see my son. ﻿It breaks my heart. ﻿I shouldn’t have taken him from Eizik’s. ﻿But we must work something out. ﻿Okay, I've heard enough. ﻿Rieven will be thrown out of school ﻿if he's not in a two-parent home. ﻿I'll allow Rieven to stay with you ﻿until the memorial. ﻿Then he goes back to Eizik’s. ﻿That's my decision. ﻿One week. ﻿You understand the consequences? ﻿Yes. ﻿Charity... ﻿Help a Jew out. ﻿Don't be anti-Hasidic, give money. ﻿Jews, give charity. ﻿Mr. Jew? ﻿Help me, please? ﻿I’m getting married. I'm an orphan. ﻿I’m the great-grandson ﻿of the Sanzer Rabbi. ﻿Don’t get married. ﻿It’s better for your health. ﻿Don't be anti-Hasidic! ﻿What did you learn in school today? ﻿We learned about the dead. ﻿About cemeteries? ﻿Yes, that you must be respectful. ﻿You may not eat or drink there. ﻿You can't do business there. ﻿Let’s read something more cheerful. ﻿I studied this passage last week. ﻿Yehuda ben Teima says… ﻿"Be bold as a leopard." ﻿What's a leopard? ﻿Just like a cat. ﻿"And be light like an eagle." ﻿An eagle flies high... ﻿"And mighty as a lion.” ﻿How does a lion sound? ﻿You do it. ﻿No, you sound like a cow. ﻿A lion! ﻿Finish your homework? ﻿Yeah. ﻿- Read a book. ﻿- Okay, okay. ﻿Ruveleh, what are you doing? ﻿Daddy, look what I found ﻿What's this? ﻿I still feel badly. ﻿We had a fight that day. ﻿I don’t want you touching my phone. ﻿Get back to your homework. ﻿You’re not done yet. ﻿Here's what I'm saying. ﻿Apartments are tiny. There's no room. ﻿I have seven kids. ﻿My wife wants more every year. ﻿I can’t do it. Seriously. ﻿A few days ago, I come home, ﻿I found my youngest asleep in the tub. ﻿Is that normal? ﻿Menashe, how are you? ﻿Thanks for coming. ﻿I have a great match for you. ﻿My cousin got a gett. ﻿Her husband hit her. ﻿Wouldn’t let her leave. ﻿But she’s finally divorced. ﻿She’s lovely, really. ﻿She looks good, really good. ﻿I’m okay. ﻿How old are her kids? ﻿One is six. The twins are three. ﻿Boys or girls? ﻿Two boys and a girl. ﻿Don’t want to hear it. ﻿Uncle? ﻿Careful where you walk. ﻿You be careful where you walk. ﻿Think it’s funny? ﻿Think it's shy? ﻿Be careful, he'll fall. ﻿See who’s at the door. ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿What? ﻿Rieven called to say you were drunk. ﻿I'm taking him home. ﻿Ruveleh, you used my phone? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Don't you want to be with me? ﻿I didn’t mean it. ﻿He wants to stay. ﻿Don’t come by here without calling. ﻿Is this a joke? ﻿See me laughing ﻿You forget what we discussed with the Ruv. ﻿You’ve lost your mind. ﻿Stop banging on the teapot. ﻿I can take care of my son. ﻿I’ll believe it when I see it. ﻿You're holier than the Ruv now? ﻿Enough! ﻿Rieven is my son, ﻿and Leah was my wife. ﻿I don't need any meddlers. ﻿And Leah’s memorial will be at my home. ﻿Enough of your squeaking. ﻿Everyone will see you're a fool. ﻿I’m sorry. ﻿I can’t believe you called Eizik! ﻿Don’t you ever use my phone again. ﻿Got it? ﻿Yes. ﻿Okay, get ready. It’s late. ﻿Time for bed. ﻿ ﻿- Hello? ﻿- Shloime? Menashe. ﻿Menashe Schwartz? ﻿No, your cousin. ﻿What's going on? ﻿I’m hosting a memorial dinner at my place. ﻿Can you come? ﻿Maybe… ﻿Is Eizik okay with that? ﻿Forget Eizik. She was my wife. ﻿Fine. Whatever's best. ﻿Can I help? Bring anything ﻿No, I’ll take care of it. ﻿You're sure? ﻿Thanks. Bye. ﻿We should decorate for the memorial. ﻿Let's buy that one. ﻿He's wearing a nice hat and coat. ﻿Mom would’ve liked it. ﻿The holy Minchas Elazar. ﻿But it’s not painted well. ﻿So let’s get that one with the book. ﻿The Chasam Sofer? ﻿We already own one like it. ﻿What do you think of this one? ﻿Rabbi Shayele Kerestirer. ﻿They say that his portrait keeps the mice away. ﻿It's a miracle. ﻿- Let's buy that one? ﻿- Yes. ﻿It’s nicely drawn. ﻿Very authentic. ﻿You’re not stronger than Daddy. ﻿You must listen. ﻿Let go. ﻿I give up. ﻿Okay, nail it in. ﻿I have a son ﻿for the memorial dinner. ﻿Let’s hear it. ﻿Once the mother went away ﻿and did not come back home. ﻿And Yankele and Shloimele. ﻿Nobody wants to hear a song like that. ﻿Sing something happier. ﻿You said you’d be quick. ﻿It will be quick. ﻿You promised me ice cream. ﻿Not now. Soon. ﻿You stink of fish. ﻿- Get out of the way, please. ﻿-I don’t want to be here. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Get off of that! ﻿It’s dangerous ﻿Why are you in a crazy mood? ﻿Put on your seatbelt. ﻿What happened ﻿Help me clean up this mess. ﻿Something happened with the fish. ﻿What? ﻿I made a turn, ﻿then I heard a crash. ﻿All the fish fell out. The boxes broke. ﻿- Everything broke? ﻿- All the fish. ﻿All of it was ruined? ﻿Should I laugh or cry here? ﻿-I wasn’t speeding. ﻿- You weren’t speeding? ﻿I made a left, then stopped. ﻿Turned around and heard a crash. ﻿Then all the fish flew out. ﻿You know how much that cost? ﻿Over $1,000. ﻿-I know. ﻿- You know? ﻿You are such a schlimazel. ﻿It's nothing but problems with you. ﻿Be healthy and well. Goodnight. ﻿Should I reimburse you? ﻿Can I ask you something? ﻿What now? ﻿Last week we talked about a loan. ﻿Can I still get it? ﻿Are you serious? After all that? ﻿You’re not ashamed? ﻿You think I have extra money? ﻿I don’t have money, either. ﻿Shut up. ﻿Work the night shift this week, ﻿and then well see. ﻿Maybe. ﻿-I can’t... ﻿- Be well. ﻿Babies are sweet. ﻿Know why? ﻿They don’t need to be big shots. ﻿Why must a Jew be clean? ﻿Being clean on the outside ﻿makes you clean on the inside. ﻿Menashe, it's been a while. ﻿How can I help you? ﻿Sorry to bother. ﻿I’m wondering if you had a recipe for kugel? ﻿Since when do you cook? ﻿Grandma, who is it? ﻿It's just the neighbor. ﻿So you're a homemaker now? ﻿It's for my wife's memorial dinner. ﻿Then let me bake it for you. ﻿No, I want to do it. ﻿Could I borrow a cookbook? ﻿I’ll write a recipe for you. ﻿Even a bear can learn to dance, they say. ﻿Good evenin ﻿Mrs. Klein, right? ﻿Good evening. ﻿Please tell your son to calm down. ﻿I hear him jumping ﻿on the bed half the night. ﻿He's a handful sometimes. ﻿But I'm grateful to have him home. ﻿How's your family lately? ﻿My family is large, ﻿and their problems even larger. ﻿This recipe is bachelor-proof. ﻿You could help me a little? ﻿What's this about? ﻿Quick, bring me some towels. ﻿You shouldn’t be so wild. ﻿Put up your other hand. ﻿No, the other one. ﻿Hold it tight. ﻿Where’s this money from? ﻿It’s for Mommy’s memorial. ﻿Who gave it to you? ﻿My uncle. ﻿What? ﻿I don’t need his money. ﻿Uncle says you never took care of Mom… ﻿even when she was sick. ﻿What? ﻿It’s true. ﻿Rieven isn't home. ﻿He's shopping with Henchi. ﻿I’m here to speak with you. ﻿Make it quick. ﻿I wanted to tell you that… ﻿you've got a real home. ﻿Yankey and Chaim get along. ﻿I don’t have that. ﻿My boy isn't with me. ﻿And my job. ﻿It’s a struggle. ﻿It’s tough. ﻿You have a normal livelihood. ﻿I don’t know how you’re successful, but… ﻿I try so hard to make things right. ﻿I’m trying to improve. ﻿ ﻿I know, but let's see you become a mensch. ﻿The memorial dinner is tomorrow. ﻿I want to show you I can do this… ﻿at my home. ﻿I can organize everything. ﻿The Ruv is coming. ﻿It would be easier at my home. ﻿Let me show you I can be independent. ﻿Come and see. ﻿We'll see tomorrow. ﻿May her soul rest in peace. ﻿Something's burning! ﻿It's smokin ! ﻿What’s going on in there? ﻿It’s nothing. I put it out. ﻿What's this smoke? ﻿This schlimazel. ﻿Let's just go to your house. ﻿The memorial must be held ﻿in her husband and son's home! ﻿But the room is full of smoke. ﻿Wash and sit down. ﻿We’re gonna choke in here. ﻿Do me a favor and sit down. ﻿The Ruv can sit there. ﻿Does the Ruv want to wash? ﻿How’s work? ﻿He does Amazon. ﻿A Hasid on Amazon? ﻿Does the Ruv allow it? ﻿Where are the women? ﻿Over at Fruma's house. ﻿This has the aftertaste of a freezer. ﻿Anyone want some more? ﻿Can we make the blessing? ﻿The law states that ﻿kugel and wine are enough. ﻿You didn't eat the kugel? ﻿I didn't notice anything wrong. ﻿It doesn't taste like potatoes. ﻿How could a kugel such as this... ﻿not be fit for a king? ﻿It’s burnt. ﻿It has no flavor. ﻿It tastes fine to me. ﻿Let’s drink a I’chaim. ﻿Her soul is in Heaven. ﻿She prays before the Creator ﻿that you may raise Rieven well. ﻿All should say of your son, ﻿praised be his father. ﻿You should pray for your mother's soul. ﻿Sing Mommy’s favorite song. ﻿Once the mother went away ﻿and did not come back home. ﻿And Yankele and Shloimele ﻿went deep into the woods. ﻿Oh little bear, oh little bear, ﻿please do not eat me. ﻿Mother will come back to us ﻿and bake us cookies, too. ﻿The little bear went far away, ﻿the children stood there still. ﻿And then the woods were filled with joy ﻿when mother came back home. ﻿You sing beautifully. ﻿You had a very dear mother. ﻿She'll always protect you. ﻿Let us sing. ﻿Goodnight. May Leah rest peacefully. ﻿May you raise the child well. ﻿Good luck. Thank you. ﻿This was an honor for the soul. ﻿She will pray for you… ﻿I tried. What can I say? ﻿Have a good night. ﻿I know I’m not perfect. ﻿My son is my only consolation. ﻿Why must he leave me? ﻿The Torah says. ﻿"Man should not be alone." ﻿"I shall make him a companion." ﻿As the Ruv said. ﻿Once you find a wife, ﻿Rieven will return to live with you. ﻿As we a reed? ﻿All right, ﻿I'll bring Rieven to you tomorrow. ﻿And I'll speak with the matchmaker. ﻿Great, good luck. ﻿Have a good night. ﻿Ruveleh, are you ready for bed? ﻿Almost. ﻿Today was a good day, right? ﻿I think so. ﻿Do you think Mom would have been proud? ﻿Of course. ﻿She'd be very proud of how you sang. ﻿Time for bed? ﻿I want to stay here. ﻿Did you say the Shema?
