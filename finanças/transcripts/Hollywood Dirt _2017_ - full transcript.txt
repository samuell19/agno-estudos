I haven?t thought about Nadia once I settle down here - Then why did you kiss her? - How did you know that? - The scout told me. We hired him - There was nothing. That kiss was nothing This relationship with her worth half of The Fortune Bottle because that's what is at stake here There is no relationship. Can I just go back to sleep now? Sure.

You don't seem upset about her leaving Don't ramble Be concise and don't look away That indicates shame Nadia and I were together for a long time Whenever you lose someone after a long time, it hurts But I think it's for the best She's happier in her new relationship And that's what I want For her to be happy That's what I would say if a reporter asked It would put me on the high road and subtly turned everyone against her Is it the truth? No. Feel very odd about Nadia I feel stupid I feel off balance I feel taken advantage of I like that answer better So would the press The truth is always more interesting but it's also much more dangerous Do you feel closer to me now? - Having heard that? - Yeah If the public knows you, Summer They will destroy you I can't help themselves They love our weaknesses so much, that they dig deeper, they feast and pillage on our exposures until we ask people-you as Summer, me as Cole-are gone And all there's left is what they want - to see. Any other questions? - What? - Ask it - Were you telling the truth when you said, I was a bad kisser? - No. -No - Be concise. Don't ramble I suppose being evasive is one of the - rules also, right? - Yeah, actually it is - Anytime you can be evasive, you should - Wait! Thank you. It's been a while I needed to hear that - It's been a while since you were kissed? Don and I are meeting at my place tomorrow morning early to go over the script You should be there - Sure. What time? - But I'm 8 a.m. Don't be late Okay. We're ready to get back at it - Yeah - Sit. Not like you're milking a cow - Where's summer? - I don't know. Her line's been busy Busy. Is everything okay - Yeah - I'll go get her [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Summer I pass your door. It's unlocked Your phone's been busy [Music] For the love of God, Summer If you want me to stop, you'd better tell me right now [moaned] Yeah [moaned] [Music] [Music] Wake up, Summer [Music] [Music] - That's a mistake - That was not a mistake It was. Stupid! Is this something that you do? You'd go psycho after you fuck someone I don't fuck people and I'm not a psycho I just don't want to - cuddle with my co-star - Co-star? - Pretty high on yourself, aren't you? - Oh, you really are an asshole Summer, am I missing something? - Did I do something to piss you off? - Yeah, you're married My wife fucked half of Hollywood while - we were married - Oh, that's what marriage is to you too She cheats so you cheat? Everyone goes away happy and even? I never from the day I met Nadia, kissed another woman, slept with another woman Not until she served me divorced papers Now there's a long list of my name on top of her Please leave, Cole [Music] - God sent his Son so we might- - What? Now? I'm sorry Sunday. Only Yankees would think that would be an appropriate time to thrust themselves into our lives [Music] - Come on - Summer, I imagine you're ready for your big day tomorrow - Don't you mind them, honey - I don't. I just don't feel great You're probably going to help me anyway - I'm an idiot - You're not an idiot - No, I'm an idiot - You're not gonna get pregnant, are you? Because that would make you an idiot - No. I have a morning-after pill - You bagged a movie star. You should be bragging on Twitter and throwing a fucking party - Seriously, Ben. How much if I did mess this up? - By screwing your co-star? Honey, you wouldn't be Hollywood if you didn't bang a co-star at some point It's nothing Don't let it affect your performance? - I won't - It's a good thing my character hates it and we started filming more now I just want to get this movie out the way and leave town Forget my past and forget Cole Masten - When do you leave? - A few days. No more beer Now let's bring you into the 21st century and get you a cell phone Cocky tried to crow this morning I was in the kitchen when I heard him in the yard First, I thought it was hurt I know I've heard it when they learn it - Takes him a while to figure it out - Yeah It was pathetic - I was embarrassed for him - Oh, he'll learn And when he does, he'll do it all hours of the day Not just at dawn like in the movies Gotta love Hollywood, right? Do you need something? - Are we good? - Stay out of my way and we'll be just fine - I don't chase, Summer - This is not a game! I'm not saying one thing and meaning another - Leave me alone - I was wrong about you You're a terrible actress It's my money, and I think I know how I want to spend it Honey, you don't want to invest in refreshments Let the boys downtown give you a Certificate of Deposit for that money Or bonds. Bonds are a great safe place for your little inheritance to sit Don't talk down to me If I wanted to let my money and smoke it like your cheap cigars, I'll do so. I believe in this product, just as much as you and all the other investors. I want in Thank you, Mr. Mitchell Some of the investors aren't wild about having a woman on board, Miss Pinkerton And what would your opinion be on the matter? I love women. Then again, you already knew that, - didn't you, Ms. Pinkerton? - I have no idea what you're talking about, Mr. Mitchell - Don't touch me! - I'm sorry, Country. I thought you liked it when I touched you - CUT! What the fuck was that? - Ask your golden boy here He put condoms in my suitcase Is that too racy for you Southern belles? Relax, Summer. It's a prank Stop it, you two! I did not sign on to referee Let's wrap for today - It's fine. It's funny - Look at her - So did we get it? - I think so, despite your best efforts She needed her feathers ruffled a little She's getting too tense It's my money and I think I know how I want to spend it - Honey, you don't want to invest in refreshments Let the boys downtown give you a Certificate of Deposit for that money Or bonds. Bonds are a great, a safe place for your little inheritance to sit Don't talk down to me. If I wanted to light my money and smoke it like your cheap cigars, I'll do so But I believe in this product just as much as you or any of the other investors And I want in - Thank you, Mr. Mitchell - It's good. Beauty changes when she's mad Another reason to push her buttons - Do want to show him the other cut? - Yeah, roll it - What? What cut? - I have no idea what you're talking about, Mr. Mitchell [Music] - So? - What's the purpose of that cut? It's hot I mean, I've got a hard-on just from watching it. Look, Mr. Masten, The other stuff is good but this stuff has emotion It's got heat You two look like you're moments away from banging right there on the desk He's right. I hate like hell to say it, - but he's right - We can't use this. It's too- Real? Ida and Royce hate each other That?s already in there But if we can use that hatred to make sexual tension, it'll bring up a whole other element into the film And it would bring in the female viewers who, right now, we have no draw on, other than your pretty mug - She would never go for it - Since when does that matter? She doesn't have script approval Okay, let's do it [Music] - Hi, Gus - Hey, Summer - Is that Cocky? - Friendly thing. You know, I heard Cole Masten keeps him in the house Yeah? - Where'd you hear that? - Around. Drove him here this morning in his truck Good morning. I've put the - Sides and updated Call sheet in here - Great Thank you There is a new scene so you want to - review it before your call time - Okay There's a kiss There is no love story between Ida and Royce I have read the book - Three times - I saw that in the damn book It's the movie. Writers are adding the excitement. If you're in the business, you know - It's normal - You know I've read the script Ida and Royce hate each Why would Royce suddenly pushes Ida against the file cabinet and kisses her passionately It is stupid The passion from their hatred will make - it hotter - No, it doesn't make it hotter It makes it stupid I swear if he kisses me - I'll be losing - Yes you will. You'll - fall apart under my mouth, baby - Please Don't flatter yourself I don't even like you Stupid side! Well, that went well - What did you expect? We threw this on her without warning I told you. We should meet with her this morning go over the changes to prepare her But no, you wanted to dump it on her via call - sheets and sides - Dump it on her. I was one of the hottest man alive last year It's not like she has to mentally adjust to a war camp How hard can it be to kiss me? It's actually three kisses and a grope - I'll go talk to her - No! With my luck, you two would make up and any authenticity to the scene will disappear Just stay away from her Cole! Cole! [Music] - I want blue - Red is punchy Red looks iconic. Red is patriotic [Music] [Music] All right, yes! Come on Come on, people. Time is money - Yeah? - I need in California tomorrow morning. You've been summoned It's an initial play mediation. I've arranged it with your director Shoot your scene then get you ass - to LA - Good - This is stupid - What's the problem, Summer? Royce gives Ida a car, and in return, she kisses him It's a peace offering I would never accept a car She certainly wouldn't be jumping up and down doing this whole pathetic routine, you guys, - have all these screwed - It's not pathetic It's how women in the forties acted You have to realize she's a divorced woman looking for a man Royce is giving her a very generous gift, and when she hugs him in gratitude, he goes in for the kiss - It's logical - It is logical if she's a woman sits at home all day knitting It is not logical for Ida Pinkerton, one of the - Original 67. Am I the only one that read the book? - Script aren't the book. It's an adaptation Summer, I gotta get on a plan in two hours Please, don't fight me on this - You're leaving? - Yeah, I gotta go home, rather, Los Angeles for the night My home is under - the control of my ex - Are you gonna stay? That came out wrong - Nevermind - I'm at the hotel. I'm meeting with the lawyers tomorrow about the divorce Can we just please, say our lines and get this baby - wrapped up? - But it's not real I don't want to do this This is not a character Then ad lib it Just like you did in the office But in return I need a kiss - Yes - Yes, I know, painful. Trust me, Country I'm not looking - forward anymore than you are - Liar Yes, baby. And so are you - Let's roll - Lock it down Do you mind watching Cocky for me while I'm gone? - Of cource - Just don't want him to be alone I could take him over to my place - Or I'm cooking over yours - Yeah, if you don't mind That's better for Cocky [Music] And, action! Well, Miss Pinkerton, what do you think? Very impressive Do you decorate all your new cars, Mr. Mitchell - It's for you - Me? - Yes. It's red - I'm a woman, Mr. Mitchell - Not colourblind - You are also not very appreciative. It's soda bottle beer. I had a dealership mix the colour just for you How very generous of you Where's my car? - This is your new car - I'm not deaf, colourblind, or stupid I can see that the car is red However, you are of some misunderstanding that I would be happy to accept this from you Well, indeed. That is my misunderstanding, Miss Pinkerton But I'm glad that for once today we are on the same page - Where's my car? The black Ford - Well, I'm not - entirely sure - Could you focus at the matter - at hand - Get it back - You don't want it back - You don't know what I want I know you want this [Music] I mean what I said, - Mr. Mitchell - About what? - I don't want it - And us? I don't want the car and I'd appreciated it if you got mine back Understood, Miss Pinkerton Enjoy your long walk home And cut! Great job. Go catch your plane [Music] Hey, it's Cole Just wanna check and see if - your new cell phone's working - It's working Summer? - Mm-hmm? - Did you just fall asleep? - Uh-huh - Do you know how many girls would kill for me to call them? Studios run giveaways and shit like this all the time, - and million's girls would sign up - Girls. Not women You know I used to want a belly button ring I am NOT a belly button ring Where are you right now? - Which room? - Yours. I hope that's okay What are you wearing? - Cole Masten, I am not doing this with you - I am asking purely out of concern for cocky He's never seen a naked woman before. I worry about his poultry hormones - Poultry hormones Cocky's just fine I'm not naked I'm wearing an underwear - And a tank top? - No I was hot and I'm going to sleep - No, you shouldn't - Uh, this is wrong Summer, I am a rock hard and all I can think about is you in my bed. Please, don't torture me by hanging up the phone - You're thinking of me? - I've been thinking about you all day I wish you're here so you can reach over and feel me right now - I've never done this before and I don't know what to say You don't have to say anything just touch yourself. Have you ever touched yourself before? Oh, yes. I've been single for 3 years I can cum myself to orgasm pretty quickly I want to be with you so bad I wish it didn't end so quickly I've thought about it all the time - You have? - Yeah Tomorrow night, stay at my house The minute I get off that plane, I'll drive there, and I will pin you down on my bed and I'll worship you And I won't let you up until my mouth imprinted on your mind and your taste is my middle fucking name - It's for the movie - No. This is different I've known you for 13 years - And how serious are you about her? - Serious? She's my co-star Please. Nadia's team breathing down my neck, and that Rottweiler of an attorney you tied me to threatening my nuts in a jar if I so much as unzip my pants What is this? Some sort of rebound or- - I wouldn't do that to her - To Summer? Fuck me. Are you in love? The mediation is starting soon We should go Well, who let you in? This is - supposed to be a private cafe - Get the fuck out of here And let me talk to my client alone Let's just go outside and make sure no one - gets in here - Okay I really don't want to listen to one of your lectures today Mm-mhmm Was your assistant correct? I mean if it is something else and just let me know We can attack it from a different side What are you talking about? Walk I've been told to stay away from someone before Made me chase her down like she was some kind of wounded gazelle - She ended up being my soulmate - So now you're saying - that I can date her? - I'm saying that I need to know what's going on so I can control the media More importantly, the judge and Nadia's take on it I can't do my job - if you're keeping things from me - Honestly, I don't know what's going on with this girl? That's the truth Cole will get the boat, plane, the Montana ranch in the Fortune Bottle Nadia will get the California and Hawaii real estate All bank accounts will go to their respective owners with joint accounts split evenly Nadia do you agree with the basics of this agreement? I suppose so, yes Cole, do you agree with the - basics of this agreement? - I do Now, if you'll excuse me I have to get back to set Shooting a movie with a no-name and nobody I guess I did hurt you more than imagined Best of luck to you, Nadia [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I can't do this [Music] Summer! Summer! Miss Pinkerton, it seems to me that you have a bit of an attitude problem Coming to my office telling me how to run my business isn't quite how we do business here at Quincy, is it? I must tell you after every time you've been in here, I've felt, oh-this is bullshit! Learn your marks and stay on them You've changed your marks five times in the past two hours. If you make up your mind. It won't be a problem You touch me again, I'll put you in your mark - and hold you there - Cut! Okay, Summer, Cole, Let's, uh, let's take five Brecken, not now We're filming. Press issues can wait - No. No. This cannot wait - What's the problem? It's not with you. It was Summer How did I not know this? How did we not know this? We didn't think we needed to do a full workup on her. I mean, look at her We ran background criminal, porn searches- did the blood work. Everything came back - clean - It wasn't a big deal. It was a long - time ago - So this is something you - already know about? - My Rehearsal Dinner? No. The Rehearsal Dinner from Hell! - Why didn't you tell us about this? - Clear the room I need to speak to Summer alone You should have told us We can control something that we know about This, we can't control. Right now, every tabloid in America has somebody getting it on a plane to Quincy When they get here, they're gonna find every single friend of yours, and every Chatty Cathy and talk to them - I don't care - You will care. You may not care right at this very second but trust me - you will care - I have been an outcast in this town for three years You think I care about what some soccer mom in Nebraska thinks - of me - It's not just soccer moms in Nebraska It's everyone in the industry You know what I think, this industry is bullshit It's the one-off thing for me After this, I'm leaving You get a lead role in a feature film, and you're just gonna disappear? Yeah You're not like any other woman I have ever met Thank you Whether you value your reputation or not you need to talk to Brecken Let her do her thing You may have to go on a couple of talk show Just tell your side of story No. I don't want to talk about it You don't want to talk about it on camera or you don't want to talk to me? How do you care? I need to know if I should have ambulances on speed dial for my crew I'll be worried about the crew I'd be more worried about yourself, Mr. Masten Don't do that Don't call me that. Not here Then where, Mr. Masten? I'm not playing this game with you I showed up for the house last night with an erection the size of Texas - And you weren't there - I'm here right now Not here I did a half-ass job with you the last time I'm not gonna make that mistake again And I do care, Summer. Just stop pushing me away You could use a friend right now A friend? Will you stop hating me for just 10 minutes and let me- I don't hate you You liked me? It terrifies me Perhaps, you and I more similar than I thought We both react, rather, passionately to betrayal I did try to kill a man with a - porcelain elephant - [Chuckles] Tell me what happened It's crazy. What I did that night? [Music] Three days before my wedding, I found out my fianc?e was sleeping with my maid of honour Turns out I was just about the last person in town to find out Should have called off the wedding But I didn't If a kid, or stupid adult or an animal eats something that they shouldn't, they feed them Ipecac Oh, it caused a violent vomiting spell that got out all the nasty So it was very easy to set up The restaurant was serving cr?me brulee for dessert, topped with a medley of berries I like to say I hesitated but that'd be a lie Two days of pent up anger, 126501:40:23, ...> 01:40:25,499 an hour of polite dinner conversation with false friends It all pushed me to my actions [Music] [Music] [Music] It was evil what I did In front of everyone Especially Quincy where appearances matter The town never forgave me That was my last moment of glory and the Quincy sun You don't need them I know I don't And that is why I'm taking my money starting a new life That's why you asked about the money right away Get out of here One of the most appealing things about you, Country Means your freedom I was infuriating as it has been You always say and act I feel I want to propose something It's Friday night, We don't have to work tomorrow Spend the night with me and for the next 24 hours, no fighting. Just us together Okay Cole! Summer! We need to deal with it! Tonight. My place. I'll handle this You came Yeah I brought condoms I have condoms. Thank you Where is your bag? I didn't bring mine.

Never had okra Oh, you're in for a treat. City boy [Music] She definitely seems to recognize me when I take her treat When I ask the feed store about the treats, I got laughed out of there You just leave these Girls come on Monday Monday? It is Friday I'm not leaving a sink full of dirty dishes Let's just clear the food off and set the plates down on the counter [Music] Focus How do you think this thing's going between us?

No First rule of Hollywood, babe The gods don't ask permission Be yourself and don't forget to smile [Music] I'm assuming, since you've squatted yourself on this personal property, that you know this beautiful woman beside me But what you don't know is that she's mine And if you fuck with her you fuck with me And if I'm ever so lucky, ask her to marry me, everyone here is invited We'll be serving cr?me brulee so make sure you eat up A joke, babe Except for the marriage part because I love you Well, look at all these visitors Y'all hungry for some tea and biscuits?
