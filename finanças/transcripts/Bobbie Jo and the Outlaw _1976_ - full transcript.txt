[ROARING] [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] ANNOUNCER ON PA: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Wild West Show, quick draw contest. Our contestants today are Robert Fleming, unbeaten in 10 previous contests, and the fastest draw west of the Rio Grande, and the challenger Lyle Wheeler, New Mexico state champion for the Wild West trophy. [CROWD MURMURING] [GUN FIRES] And the winner is Lyle Wheeler. Fantastic! That was the quickest draw I've ever seen. Congratulations, Lyle Wheeler. Let's hear it for Lyle. I'm sorry, son, but your water pump is out. Get a rebuilt one for $27.50, but I'd have to go into town to get it, and I just couldn't guarantee it. Well, it looks like I got no choice. You might as well go ahead and fix it. -All right. -Thank you. You bet. Uh, fill her up with premium, would you? And wash the windows... No, I don't work here, my car just broke down, the water pump. Attendant, he should be back in just a minute, though. Sounds like you forgot the preventive maintenance. Yeah, I guess you might say that. This here is my speed wagon. -Yeah. -Goes 150 miles an hour. And I can cover eight Western states every 12 days. -Really? -Uh-huh, yes, sir. It keeps me hopping. -Herb's my name. -How you doing? Leather is my game. Hold it. All right, got alligator here, I got cowhide. How about a new jacket there? I can fix up anybody, huh? No, I don't need a jacket, thank you. Need? Just the other day now I sold an old lady 18 pair of shoes, she only needed one. -No, come on... -You see, nobody only buys what they need. If everybody did that, we'd all starve to death. Well, besides not needing one, I can't afford one, I'm sorry. Now, wait a minute, money's no excuse because I can offer you credit, huh? You know something, I think this is how you get your kicks. No, no, selling is my whole life. [INHALES] It's my way of breathing. That and my automobile here. Yeah, this really is a fine car. This is great. Get in. Really? Hey, thanks. Great. Just get in there and sit down now and feel that. Oh, yeah, yeah. Hey, what kind of engine you got in here? That's a 454 cobra. Start it up there. Listen to it purr just like a kitten. Oh, yeah, that's great. You oughta get yourself one of these, boy. Don't mind if I do. [INAUDIBLE YELLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIREN WAILING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [CRASHES] [TIRES SCREECHING] Okay. There you go. Okay. Bobbie Jo makes 'em cream in their jeans. -[LAUGHING] -Beat your meat, George. -What's the matter with you? -Oh, nothing. They're just hassling me, that's all. -I think they're kind of cute. -Oh, come on, Essie, really. -Is this your order? -No. Maybe you're just too damn particular, Bobbie Jo. Why shouldn't I be? 'Cause you're never going to get married that way. -I don't want to get married. -You do want to. No, I don't. I want to travel maybe or something. I don't know. You're dreaming again, my dear. Okay, so what have you got in mind, Princess? Well, I'll know him when I see him. Hey, listen, you just have a minute. Uh, why don't you go ahead and go and I'll take your station. I thank you. -Howdy? -How you doin'? -Good, how you doin'? -Just fine, thank you. Can I take your order? Listen, how come you have to do all the work around here? She's off work now. Oh, I see. Hey, come here. What's her name? Essie. That's her name? Bobbie Jo. Aha. Well, listen, will you tell Bobbie Jo to come over here? I said she's off work now. May I please take your order? All right. I'll have a hamburger, an order of french fries and a Coca-Cola. -And a Coke. -That's right. And lots of ice in the glass. -You got it. -Bye. [TIRES SCREECHING] Bobbie Jo? Yeah, Momma. This Jehovah's Witness came to the door yesterday. She said we all need saving. We're doing all right, Momma. No. I think she was right. God knows things haven't been right around here since... since your father died. Oh, I've tried my best, all alone as I am. Momma, we've been doing fine for 10 years now. I tried my best, and look what's happened. Your sister's run off and you staying out all night. Bobbie Jo, did you let him kiss you? Momma, I told you, last Friday I was with Essie. Uh-huh. Well, I could've had a heart attack for all you care, too. I have to have my own life, too, you know. Running around all day and night? It wasn't like that when I was young. You're right, Momma, times have changed. Not in the eyes of the Lord, young lady. What do you want me to do, Momma? Enter a convent? Bobbie Jo, I just want you to be good. You know what that means? To you it means roll over and die, I'll find peace in heaven. You see, right away you start exaggerating. Well, let me tell you something, young lady. I don't know what I would've done without the good Lord. It seems to me, Hattie, that liquor gives you a lot more peace of mind than the Lord if you ask me. Well, now you just take that back, Miss Uppity. It's getting hot in here, Hattie. I'm gonna take some fresh air. I'll see you later. Well, hello. Come on, lover boy, move it. Or did you lose your nerve? -Okay, so where're we going? -Just drive. Yeah, but you don't even know who I am. Should I care? Hey, you know, you kinda remind me of somebody. Linda Ronstadt. Is she your idol? Kinda. Who's yours? Billy the Kid. Billy the Kid? Why is that? Because he didn't take no shit from nobody. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] You like country music? Oh, yeah. It really sounds good. It means to me about what this car does to you. [CHUCKLES] Now, how did you know that? They told me at school that I was a tease.

Oh, now that is a real possibility, I think, with your talent. Aw. That's really nice to hear, but you didn't really have to say that. No, no, you know... I think you're smart enough to do anything you really want to do, if you just put your mind to it. Now, you could be a real star. All you need is a little management, maybe. Well, maybe if I'd had voice lessons when I was little or something, but now it seems like it's late, I guess. It's never too late. You gotta have dreams and persistence, that's the most important thing. You keep doing what you want and working, and pretty soon, you're the best, if you believe in yourself. Hey, you know what the motto of the Texas Rangers was? No, what? "Little man will beat big man every time "if little man's in the right and he keeps on a-comin'." You know, when I was about... oh, about five or six, I guess, I used to stand in front of the mirror, and I'd get all dressed up, and I'd pretend like I was Minnie Pearl at the Grand Ole Opry. -Really? -Yeah. -Well, how'd that feel? -Terrific! I was a star. Yeah, well, I used to practice being a gunfighter the same way. -You're kidding me. -No, no. -In the mirror? -Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. I won every time, hands down, too.

Now, come on, you're gonna get it. -Okay... -Now... you put both hands together, cock the hammer... That's right. Now, you just squeeze that trigger, and it's just like prayin', go ahead. -I hit! I hit it! -[LAUGHS] Sure you hit it. Of course! Told you, it's just like prayin'.

Well, that's a little gaff I had made. I can make that pinball sit up and do tricks. It just follows my hand right around the board. That's wild! Well, I guess I'm just naturally lucky. I think that you are probably the smartest person that I've ever met in my whole life. -Really? -Yeah. Does that mean that you like me better than your mother? Better than anybody. Get me out of this. God! Get me out of this. God! Lyle, where'd you learn about all this stuff? Oh, from my brother. -He's a hunter. -Yeah? But he never kills anything he can't eat. What about the gun? Oh, it's my dad's, it's a single action colt, sort of like the one Billy used to use. Really? Billy the Kid. Are you like your dad? I don't know, he died before I was born. I'm sorry. Oh, it was a hunting accident. My brother was with him at the time. That's awful. Well, he said that Dad used to always say never to lose your footing or you're a goner. I just sort of always believed that. Well, is that how come you learned to shoot so good? What's that suppose to mean? Well, because you weren't sure of your footing. No, no, that ain't it. I got confidence that won't quit. [CHUCKLES] Tell me, what's it like on the road? -Selling? -Yeah. Oh, it ain't a bad life. Lots of towns, lots of girls? No, no, nothing like that. Hey, listen, could I tell you something personal about myself? Would you promise not to get angry? Oh, I wouldn't get angry. And you wouldn't laugh either? No, I wouldn't laugh. I like you too much, Lyle. [EXHALES] Well, I lied, I... I'm no leather salesman. I found that sample case in a gas station back in Los Alamos. Oh, well... Uh... Shoot, what's wrong with that? You sure you're not mad? I'm not mad. I promise.

Honey, this car ain't mine, it's hot. Holy shit, you mean you ripped it off? Don't matter. They hang car thieves in this country. Oh, my God. -Oh, my God. -Oh, no. [SIREN WAILING] [TIRES SCREECHING] -Lyle, look out! Look out! -I'm dead! Lyle! Hit the deck right now, move! All right, you can get up now. [CHUCKLES] [PANTING] Hey, you got any bright ideas what we should do now? Uh, I got a sister that's in show business. -Pearl! -Um, right. She, uh... Maybe she can help. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hi. -Hey. Say, will you look at that, my baby sister. You know, I never thought you'd turn out to be such a raving beauty. It's in the family, Pearl. Yeah. Ouch. [EXCLAIMS] I'm about an ornery son of a bitch. Hey, Slick, honey, I want you to meet somebody. This is my little sister, Bobbie Jo, and, uh, that's her friend Lyle. -How you doin'? -Yo. And this is, uh... -Essie. -Essie. PEARL: Essie, right. Well, what's the occasion here? Oh, uh, we just sorta came by to say hello. -Broke? -Yeah. SLICK: You need work? Hey, come on now, Slick, she don't wanna work in this crummy joint, and I don't blame her neither. She's always jumping in when she don't know what the hell she's talking about. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You take this $10 and go on out and get yourself a feed somewhere, and I'm gonna figure somethin' out for you -when you get back. -Thanks. You got wheels there, stud horse? Yeah. You mind giving me a lift over my office, I gotta pick somethin' up over there. Yeah, sure, I'd be glad to. I sure would appreciate it. -See y'all back here in a while. -Bye-bye. Lyle, uh, honey, be careful, okay? -Why do you say that? -I don't know, I... I guess I just don't want to let you out of my sight. Oh, come on, don't worry. Hey, come on, loosen the leash. Slick might seem like he's a little dense, right? But I'll tell you something, he is the best that I've ever had in the sack. And you know something else, he's a really good dancer, too. Whoo, whoo. [GIGGLES] And he loves me. [CHUCKLES] He seems nice. One night he comes walking up to me and he says, "Hey, pussy willow." That's what he calls me, you know. He says, "You wanna know something, "you're really too good to be doing this kind of work." I think he's right. So do I. You know what happened? He got me that night. -Mmm. -Hey... You guys aren't in any trouble, are you? No. No, we're not in any trouble. Whoo, far out, man, that's wild! Hey, that's really wild. You like that, huh? You want a snort? Oh, no, thanks. Hey, you ain't never seen me high, have you? I'm funny as hell when I'm high. I'll tell you, I'm badder than an ornery son of a bitch, whew! Hey, man, whereabouts is this office of yours anyway, huh? Just make a left up here at the next corner. Pull over. I'll be right back. How long you gonna be? Just a couple of minutes. Halt! [GUNSHOT] [GROANS] LYLE: You stupid goddamn idiot. Do you realize what you've done? -Did you get the gun? -Shit, yes, you maniac. Hey, why the hell didn't you tell me what was going on back there, huh? I didn't wanna let you in on it. They must've had a bigger payroll this time with that security guard there. Hey, man, now I'm the one that's gonna... Hey, do you realize I killed someone? Don't worry about it, man, that gun's hot. I should've left you back there to die. Hey, I'm grateful. I really am, I'm grateful, that was some shootin'. You gonna need a doctor for that? No, just get me over to Pearl's place. She'll take care of me. PEARL: Now don't worry. It's okay. Look, honey, I got something here that'll just fix you up fine. Ow! What's wrong with you? Now, Slick, come on now, there's just a little graze on your leg. MAN ON RADIO: We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin. Tragedy struck tonight in Lordsburg, New Mexico, as a 47-year-old night watchman was shot and killed as he tried to apprehend two men who fled from the scene of the robbery of the New Mexico Peterville Center in an orange Mustang. An all-out alert is on throughout Guadalupe County, says Sheriff Hicks. Apprehension is expected soon. And now, back to today's program. [GROANS] Uh... I guess we're all in this together now. Bullshit, what do you mean "we"? I'm the one who's gonna hang, not you all. Now, wait a minute, we're all family, aren't we? Pearl's right, honey. Listen, we'll work it out together. Lyle, why don't we just give up now before things go too far? Your idea sucks. LYLE: Well, I got news for you. Things have already gone too far. Kill the lights. I guess now that we're in this thing together, we might as well do our first thing and get out of here. BOBBIE JO: How? LYLE: Okay, we'd better get out to the roof. I got a little plan. Come on, let's go. MAN: Road blocks have been set up for suspects in last night's murder. Now, you guys remember, I'm gonna be right behind you watching, okay? But the radio says road blocks. Yeah, I know, that's your stitch. You stop and stall 'em in case I have to make a break for it. I'll do that. Uh, Lyle, honey, can I ride with you? Hey, not this time. First, let's get out of this scrape. I mean, they don't know about you all and, uh... I need all the help I can get. Okay. -Go on. -Bye. Lyle... -Take care, darling. -Oh! Be careful. Okay. Don't let your meat loaf. Drive, you hotshot. -Hello, Officer. -Howdy, folks. -Hello, Officer. -Hello, lady. What's your destination? We're going to the Young Christian Folk Singers meet. Always had a lot of respect for the Lord, lady. So have we, sir. But I thought that meeting was in Gallup last week. Well, they might've had one in Gallup. I don't know about that, but the one we're going to is in Santa Fe. Oh, I see. Well, you all take it easy, you hear? You can go now. -Thanks a lot. Bye. -Bye. Move that barricade. I'm glad the Lord's not trying to trap you, 'cause I'd kill that son of a bitch. Come on, Slick, just put that thing away. He don't know nothing, he's a dummy. ALL: ♪ Bringing in the sheaves ♪ Bringing in the sheaves ♪ We will be rejoicing bringing in the sheaves ♪ ♪ Bringing in... [TIRES SCREECHING] Come on, Slick, move it, will you? Holy shit. Wow, that was really incredible what you did at the roadblock. Uh-huh, you guys are very good, but don't let it go to your head, you understand? -Now, go on, get back in. -[SCREAMS] -Oh. -You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Listen, uh, I don't know if it's gonna work out too well traveling with this bunch. Oh, Lyle, they did good at the roadblock, didn't they? It's good luck to have family. Yeah, but don't you think you and I could travel better alone? Well, we'll just stay one jump ahead of 'em, that's all. Yeah, I guess you're right. They're a pretty good bunch. [LAUGHS] I'm gonna go swim. How come you gotta do all the dirty work, Slick? Hell, I don't mind, I kinda like working on cars. Yeah, do you know that you're doing everything that Lyle tells you to do? That's because Lyle is much smarter than I am when it comes to planning things out. Now, hell, you know me. I can't plan a trip to the supermarket. [SIGHS] Yeah. But I just wish you'd speak up a little bit more. You never talked like that to me before. Well, before it was just you and me. Do you know what you're starting to act like now? -Mmm. -One of them yellow bellies with a big stick up his ass. Now before you go jumpin' on me, pussy willow, you gotta remember one thing. And I don't want you to ever forget it, ever. What's that? A hard man is good to find. Whoo! All right. Whoo! You got that bucket of bolts ready? Everything's in top shape, Lyle, top shape. LYLE: Good work. Well, what're we gonna do now, Lyle? We're gonna lay low and figure out what our next move's gonna be. I don't even know where we are. Well, I'm driving, you'd better find out. Here you go. [RADIO PLAYING] Open it for me. Well, I guess we'd better head south for now in two cars. And if we get separated, we'll meet at Roswell, how's that? Honey, I wanna travel with you now, okay? -Sure. -We interrupt this program for a special announcement from the Sheriff of Guadalupe County, Bud Hicks. Hey there, Sheriff Hicks here, Sheriff Bud Hicks. How you doin', Sheriff? Now, I wanna make an appeal to Lyle Wheeler somewhere out there. I know you're too scared to give yourself up, but due to extenuating circumstances, I can promise you a fair trial. Now, I can tell you right off, but we believe you weren't implicated in the way that you thought you were. See? So, if you all just come in and give yourself up nice and peaceful like, I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt. -Sure. -Oh, yeah. And if you don't... I'm gonna hunt you down like a dog. You're not gonna give up to that fat little bugger, are you? [LAUGHING] Pearl, what is wrong with giving up? Oh, screw that sheriff, come on. Lyle, he said amnesty. That means we can all go back. Hey, listen, you're free to do whatever you wanna do, okay? Damn it, I mean all of us can go back together. Hey, Lyle, you're not gonna listen to this fifth wheel, are you? Okay, fine, that's just fine, what then? Well, I guess, we'd just better lay low for a while and keep 'em guessin' 'til we get our little mitties on some more money, huh? All right. How did they find out it was you, I don't understand? Oh, they probably traced that car I left back in that gas station in Los Alamos. Operator, I'd like to speak to Sheriff Hicks. Lyle! Lyle Wheeler! -What is it? -Get up, get up, stay down. This is Sheriff Hicks. Get over there to the window, cover me at the window. BOBBIE JO: Where's Essie? You're completely surrounded, Lyle. There ain't no way you can get away. Hey, listen, you two go through the hatch, right underneath that cupboard back there, under the rug on the floor. Go out under it, get the car, come around and cover us. Come on, Bobbie Jo. Essie, Essie, where are you? Now, Lyle, just like I said on the TV, you all give yourself up, I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt. I think you should say something. No, no! Maybe I should go with them. [SIGHS] Shut up. He's got six of them out there. They're coming around with the car. Don't worry about it. All right, boys if he don't come out in three seconds, we're gonna let him have it. No! No, you promised! Lyle, watch out. Let's get out of here! [TIRES SCREECHING] [GASPING] Lyle, he prom... He promised me. That there wasn't gonna be any guns. He prom... -He promised me. -It's okay, it's okay. -We forgive you. -Essie, I love you. [GASPING] I love you. I'm sorry. No. Oh! [SIGHS] Essie. -She's dead. -No. -She is. -No. -Come on, Bobbie. -[CRYING] LYLE: Hey, you know what, she was really okay. I'm gonna miss her. "After the raid on Coffeyville, "where all his brothers was killed, Emmet Dalton said, 'It made me a criminal. I wanted to get killed in one hell-firing minute of smoke and action.'" Well, she had their spirit, She could have been a Dalton for all we know. You. -You, too, Pearl. -Yeah. Now it's dust to dust and ash to ash. This might not be the best deal in the world, but it's the only one we're ever gonna get. So we might as well learn to live with it. -Amen. -Amen. Amen. I'll tell you one thing for sure. They ain't gonna get away with this. Now, I got something to say. That mealy-mouthed, lily-livered sheriff has gone far enough. Be something to put him to shame and get us a reputation. Do what, Lyle? We're gonna rob us a bank. A bank! -Now you're talking. -Christ! I've got it all figured out. First of all, we need a whole lot more firepower. -Meaning what? -You gotta have guns, darling. And you are gonna have to learn how to use 'em really well. Now, let's go. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [WIND WHISTLING] [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] BOBBIE JO: Yeah! [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] All ready to fire. Get the sure foot, right. [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Okay, pull back. -Now it's ready to fire. -It's ready to fire. Now, you're gonna find, pussy willow, the power of speech in one of these things, it's amazing. -Keep it down. -You get people to crawl around on their hands and knees and bark like a dog, crow like a rooster. [LAUGHING] You'll see what I'm talking about. Oh, wait a minute now... Okay, let's do it together, okay. -Count to three, okay? -Come on, girls. -All right, one, two, three. -One, two, three. [FIRING] -[ALL EXCLAIMING] -PEARL: Was that great? -You were fabulous, I guess. -[LAUGHING] Pussy willow, that was just beautiful. Come on, let's try it again, all right. Jesus, Pearl, what's taking 'em so long? You can't hurry these things, baby. Well, I'm gonna go in and see what's going on. No, you just stay close by. 'Cause I don't wanna have to leave you behind. And when Lyle says go, I'm going. [GUN FIRING] -What, are you crazy? Get down! -Bobbie Jo! It's loaded, ready to go. Just squeeze the trigger if you have to. Come on, let's go. [GUN FIRING] Come on! Come on you! Roll this thing, you dumb blonde! [TIRES SCREECHING] Hey, babe, don't ever let that happen again, all right? Or I ain't coming back for you, okay? Oh, but, Lyle, I made them dance, didn't I? Yeah, just cool it. MAN: Now those people never gave us any trouble. And besides, they promised me $50 for the week. I know, I know, and we weren't using the barn anyway. But I just don't like strangers hanging around. Mr. and Mrs. Potts, uh, I can't tell you how much I appreciate your kindness and your hospitality to me and my good friends here. And reciprocation for that, I wanna give you $50. But I don't have it on me right now, so I'm gonna send it to you in the mail. Bobbie Jo, if you'll get their address here. And I wanna thank you all again, and God bless. Oh, by the way, watch us on the TV tonight. You goin' on a game show? No, sir, we're gonna be on the news. See y'all. Excuse me, Mr. Potts, what's your address? Uh, uh, Potts Farm, Route 4, Clovis, New Mexico. And Mrs. Potts, we really loved your pies. They were great. Don't mention it. -Okay. Bye-bye. -Thanks a lot, bye-bye. Bye-bye. Now, you see, Mabel, ain't those nice kids? Why, they wouldn't hurt anybody. [MUSIC PLAYING] Blue Bunny, this is Red Rover, bend over. PEARL: Bend your egg, Rover, over. Okay, now we're passing, uh, Checkpoint Charlie. -Where are you? -Same here. We're getting into position. Two minutes to go, over. Okay, Blue Bunny, this is Red Rover, turning over. Good luck, Bobbie Jo. Let's go. [ENGINE STARTING] -You have an account here? -No. Well, this is an out-of-town check, and I'm sorry, we have a policy here. All right, okay, thank you. Sure. [TIRES SCREECHING] [ALL SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Hello, folks, I'm Slick Callahan. These are my cohorts, Miss Bobbie Jo and Lyle Wheeler. Now, you all just remain in your respectful positions while we take care of business. No, please! Ma'am, hey, ma'am! Ma'am, don't worry about a thing. -Don't shoot me, please. -Bobbie Jo, get her a chair. Sit right down, darling. It's all right, don't be scared. No one's gonna hurt you. Come on, baby! Let's get out of here. [MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Holy shit, Leroy, look what happened here. Now come on, you people get out of here. Get out of here, this here building's quarantined. Now, come on. Now, move out, move it. Leroy, you call the station right away, you hear me? You tell them to get over here on the double. Holy shit! [SNIFFING] [SIGHS HEAVILY] Well, now tell me, Lyle. What is it that makes you fight the pigs the way you do? Oh, it was just an accident, kind of one thing led to another, you know. Oh, you mean you didn't set out to start no revolution? [LAUGHS] No, no, no, I just hit the road, that's all. And the country just rose up and smacked me upside the face. Oh, geez, I'll bet that hurt like hell. [LAUGHS] Well, now, you know... There you go. You know, you could stay right here in the palace with us, if y'all want. Oh, that's really kind of you, but we really gotta be movin' on. -Yeah. -Thanks for your hospitality. Well, that's all right, that's all right. [LAUGHS] Well, y'all take care now, you hear? Okay, thank you very much for everything. -Goodbye, sweetie. -Bye sweetheart. Thanks a lot, Magic Ray. -Oh, it wasn't nothin'. -Oh, you're wonderful, bye. So long. Drive careful now. [CAR APPROACHING] [CAR DOOR SLAMMING] Howdy, boy. I said howdy. Ain't you people sociable around here? Well, hi, Admiral. Look, we got reason to believe there's a bunch of bank robbers coming this way. Y'all seen no hide nor hair of 'em? Well, have a look-see for yourself. Now we know, they ain't here now. But they might have been. Well, we ain't seen hide nor hair of 'em. Now, listen, which way'd they go? Well, I don't know. Maybe they breezed through on some higher plane. [SPITS] Tobacco's a nasty habit, Sheriff. Hmm, hey, not when it's your only vice. You're wastin' your time here, man. Well, I don't care what state they're in or where they go, I'm gonna get them bunch of murderin' thieves... Well, now, we don't prejudge anybody, Sheriff, not even you. [GRUNTS] Now, Deputy, you know you ain't gonna get that boy to talk that way. I don't condone violence, son. [GRUNTS] [CHOKING] -That's enough, Leroy. -Oh. [CHOKING] Leroy, I said that's enough! -Now quit it. -[GASPS] Get on back to the car. Now, son... all I'm askin' you for is just a little bit of cooperation. You stupid son of a bitch! [GRUNTS] [GROANS] [EXCLAIMS] [GASPS] [SIGHS] Piece of... [BREATHING HARD] Man, that sure was some ride, huh? It's a great car they got, pussy willow. Pussy willow... how the hell did we wind up in Texas? Well, honey, there sure weren't no road signs in them there hills, you know. [LAUGHS] Hey, listen, why don't you girls go on in here and get yourself an ice cream while Slick and I go across the street and get a shave? Oh, listen, don't forget to give that $50 back to that couple where we stayed on the ranch. Mr. Potts probably forgot who we are by now, Lyle. Now, it's a matter of principle, I gave him my word. Hey, wait a minute, I really don't see that... -Hey... -Because that's our money. You don't have to see. You just go on and get some ice cream. Now, you're the banker, darling. Take care of it. I will. -I want some ice cream. -Ice cream. [LAUGHS] Hi. Can we have an ice cream cone? You want one? -Yeah, a chocolate. -Two. Goddamn! Wow! [EXCLAIMS] Lyle, I can't believe it. [LAUGHS] Look what it says. It says, "Lyle Wheeler won't escape me," "vowed Sheriff Hicks. "And not the others neither. And that goes for his girlfriend, Bobbie Jo Baker." Bobbie Jo Baker. Oh, God. "And her sister Pearl, and that no-good cheap chiseler, Slick Callahan." Well, shit, that's not very nice to say about Slick. That's an insult. -Come on! -Look! And they don't even say nothing here about my dancin' neither. We'll get two of 'em, one for the boys. Thank you. Oh, doesn't he look cute? Thanks. Oh, yeah, he looks all right. -Great. -Mmm-hmm. Now, you gentlemen just relax. I've got to go outside and stroke my strap. Hey, Lyle, you wanna go outside and help him stroke his strap? [LAUGHS] I think he left his strap here a long time ago. [LAUGHING] Okay, boys, put your hands up. Move! You're both under arrest in the name of Sheriff Hicks of Guadalupe County. Now just who are you, mister? Gance, Abel Gance, Deputy. Don't move unless you feel real lucky, 'cause I don't give a shit how I get the reward. Dead or alive, I get it. Why, I'd be a fool. That's right. And you, you must be that petty thief, huh? You like to steal things? Now why don't you kinda come on try to steal by me, huh? Hey, cheese face, I'm gonna take you apart. I eat shit like you for breakfast every morning, boy. If I had my way, I'd hang your asses right now, both of you. But the law is the law, huh? I--I told you not to move. Now, Buster, I want you to watch that asshole. And I want you to watch that asshole. And if either one of those assholes move, bang, I want you to shoot them right where their onions grow. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. 'Cause I'm gonna call the sheriff now and get rid of these guys. Can I have your boots? [LAUGHS] If I have your boots in my store, business might improve, seeing how famous you are. Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. Just as soon as I'm finished with 'em, you can have 'em, okay? -Why, thank you, Lyle. -They're on their way. [SHOUTING] [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Get on the floor, on your knees, you fat slob. -[MUMBLING] -Now get down there! Come on, I want to see you squeal like a pig. Go on, start squealing! Come on, squeal! [SQUEALING] Squeal louder like a little-widdle piggy poo! Come on, squeal! Come on, fat face, squeal! [SQUEALING] Oh, all right, now get up in that chair. Come on, get in that chair. -[EXCLAIMING] -[SQUEALING] [GASPING] Porky, what you're gonna need is a nice close shave. I'll do anything, anything, please, man! [SCREAMING] Please, no! You can't exactly call the sheriff and tell him not to come after us. All right, now. Listen, I got a place to hide. I got money. Buster, tell 'em I got money. [CRYING] I got money, please. Money don't buy everything, Deputy. Go ahead, tie him up. Look at him squeal, like a goddamn pig! No! No, please! Porky, what you need is a new mouth. [SCREAMING] You son-of... Goddamn it, Slick! Come on, let's get out Now, you stay put for 15 minutes, you understand me? -Yes... -You understand, boy? Yes! [CRYING] Move over, darling. Start this thing up, Pearl. Lyle, what happened? -Slick up here killed a deputy. -Oh, my God. How in the hell did that happen? -I guaran-goddamn-tee he had it coming. -No, he-- Will you two stop arguing! What the hell's the difference?! Now start the car! The difference between self-defense and deliberately killing someone in front of a witness is the difference between good and evil, you dummy! Start the car. -Come on, start this thing up. -Can't start it. -BOBBIE JO: Move over. -I can't start it, I'm trying. -BOBBIE JO: Move up. -Get over. Go, Lyle. [ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SCREECHING] You got any idea which way they went, Buster? No, no, they didn't say. I don't know. No, I don't suppose not. But didn't they say anything, just... Anything to give me a clue or something, you know? Ah, well, oh... Uh, Lyle said that I could have his boots when he's through with 'em. Now, it's gonna be a whole lot sooner than you think, Buster, -I'll tell you. -Huh? I'm gonna get him. And you can bet on it. Come on, Leroy. [DOOR SQUEAKING] Hey, Lyle, you know, this sure is a nice car you stole. Yeah, the cowboys probably rode Lincoln Continental horses! -You know what I mean? -Yeah. -Hey, what's the matter? -I don't know, Lyle. [CRYING] I'm scared. I wanna see my momma. Hey, there's no chance of that, we gotta keep runnin'. Hey, shut up, razor-happy. Hey, honey, why even bother? Hattie never cared a lick for neither one of us. Listen, if you want to see her, you're gonna see her, okay? -Lyle, that is not safe. -Of course it ain't safe, darling. But like I said, if the little lady wants to see her momma, she's gonna see her, now you just drive. Are you sure you're happy now, honey? Never better, Momma. The sheriff gave me a number for you to call. That's in case I saw you. Hello, Hattie. Hello, Pearl. -Momma. -He wants to talk to Lyle. Now, he thinks that you and Lyle are innocent. Yes. Not like... Not like who, Hattie? Anyway, Bobbie Jo, you keep it, huh. He sounded nice, he did. Hattie, what's the real reason? -Momma. -PEARL: Come on, Hattie. Bobbie Jo, well, I gotta admit, he said he'd give me $50 if I had you call him. Hattie, you know, I just wanna tell you one thing. You have never changed, and I don't know why I ever hoped that you would. Bobbie Jo, I need the money. I know, Momma. I know. Listen, we gotta go, so, uh... I'll see you later, okay? I love you. Goodbye, Momma. I love you. Bye-bye, baby. [RADIO STATIC] -Well, if it isn't our good friend Sheriff Hicks. -Oh, Jesus! Y'all seen any of these here people there? Leroy, you go take a check out back, see what you can see there. -Yeah, yeah, I know these folks. -[TELEPHONE RINGING] All right, listen, you all stay here for about 60 seconds, I'm gonna go decoy 'em. When you hear one shot, come out. And you pack that trunk, girl. [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] They checked in last night about 7:00. They haven't been out all day, as far as I know. All right, which room they in? Uh, hang on just a second. Room number, uh, number 8. No, no, they're in number 9, number 9. Are you sure now? -Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. -All right. Are they dangerous, Sheriff? They're Lyle Wheeler's gang. You tell me. [GRAVEL CRUNCHING] -[FIRING] -[GRUNTING] Come on, they're down this way, let's get 'em. All right, come on out with your hands up, you muggin' thieves. All right, that's resisting arrest, let 'em have it. All right, cover us, boys. Come on, Deputy. Oh, my God! It's not them. We just killed three innocent people. It's the Lord's will, they was sinners. Sheriff, I made a mistake, uh... The night manager sent them to another room when I wasn't here. Texas newspapers are offering a reward for our hides. Well, what about tomorrow, Lyle? Now, don't worry, pussy willow. Tomorrow we're gonna hold up in style. Are we still going to the Pueblo, like you said? What do you think, Slick? I vote we head down to Mexico, just as soon as we can. Oh, that sounds great. I'd love a taco right now. [SIGHS] Well, I think we oughta sleep on it tonight. [WHISPERS] Hey, Lyle. Lyle, hold me. Lyle, make love to me tonight. What's going on with Lyle? He has things on his mind, Pearl, that's all. He knows what's gonna happen, just like I know what's gonna happen. It doesn't really bother me. I'm ready for it. The only thing that bothers me is that we're dragging you into this, too. You're not dragging me into nothing. Pussy willow, goddamn it, I just don't want to see you get hurt that's all. Slick, you know all my life everybody's always told me that... that I'm no good, right. And you're the first person who ever told me that I'd ever amount to anything. I'll tell you something, I am not leaving you. You can go off and do whatever you have to do. But right now, I just wanna do what I wanna do. Five dollars and 53 cents. -I'll draw you for it. -What are you talking about? -My name is Joe Grant. -So? Fastest draw in Texas. Oh, is that a fact, now? I recognized you right off the bat. Lyle, right? Yeah, yeah. I never heard of you. Took the championship four years in a row in Texas. My, my, my. You're a real wiseguy, aren't you? Don't go away, I'll be right back. Stupid. All right, Lyle, make your play. I think you're making a big mistake. Shootin' against the clock, that ain't nothin'. Drawin' against a man, that's something. Are you sure you wanna go through with this? Better draw, boy, 'cause I'm gonna try to kill ya. Lyle, what in the hell are you doing? Just payin' the bill, darling. Get back inside. All right, make your play. No, I never drawed first against nobody, Joe Grant. You're gonna have to do that. Give me a hundred dollar bill. Maybe that'll help pay for a decent burial. Let's get out of here. Come on. [ENGINE STARTING] Joe was about the best around these parts, Mr. Grant. Yep, none faster in West Texas. Sure sorry to see him go this way. Thank you for your time, Mr. Grant. Sheriff, I found this map in the bar. There's something in the margin right here. You wanna take a look? Somebody wrote Pueblo there several times. Do you think it means anything? Can't take a chance it don't. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] [HORSES TROTTING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [DOOR CLOSING] Car's in good shape, Lyle, ready to roll anytime you are. Did you see Bobbie Jo? Oh, she went to get us some food. Where, in town? Come on, don't worry about her, Lyle. -Yes, ma'am, can I help you? -Yes, sir. [REGISTER CLICKING] What you lookin' at? You look familiar. Are you Jack Kingman's daughter? No, sorry, I've never been here before. I'll be darned. I could swear I know you. Nope. -Come on, come on! -Yes, ma'am. -How much do I owe you? -That'll be 3.85. -There you go. -I'm sure it's right. 3.85, four, five. Put it in a bag, please. SHERIFF HICKS: All right, Lyle Wheeler, I know you're in there. And I told you I was gonna get you, and this time I got you, dead to right. Now you ain't got a snowball's chance in hell of gettin' out of there alive. Well, I'm gonna give you 10 seconds to come out with your hands up. One... two, three, four... -Get low, goddamn it, get down. -Five, six... -Seven, eight, nine and 10. -Get down. [GUNS FIRING] [GLASS SHATTERING] [GROANS] Hey, Slick, this ain't... Baby. Oh. [GROANING] Sheriff, I found this book on Western outlaws inside. It's got a page marked. Look here what it says. "The biggest fool there is, "is the one who thinks he can beat the law, that crime can be made to pay." -Oh, please... -"It never paid and never will. And that was a lesson of the Coffeyville raid." Emmet Dalton. You are a bastard! You bastard! [SPITS] Get her out of here! You fat pig!
