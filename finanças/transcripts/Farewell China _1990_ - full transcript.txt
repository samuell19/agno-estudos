Thinking of when my ancestors decided to leave China, they never knew what it was like there. Full of worries, they thought the foreign land must be very different. US CONSULATE, SHANGHAI. Here comes the Consul. He's coming! Holy Mother Mary, Jesus Christ, Almighty Buddha. Chairman Mao, Premier Deng, please bless the Consul. Visa lady, let everything go well. Issue the visa quickly. Good health to you. You know what 214A means? 214A? Hai! Yes. I cannot apply... In 3 months... Except my condition... more good. Now my condition more - I see that your application for a visa has been rejected many times in the last 4 years. I don't want to waste your time. And I don't want to waste my time. My condition now - more good. I changed school. I changed sponsor. I - I'll come back when I've finished studying. I'll come back. I promise I'll come back! I work in foreign trading. An overseas education is very important. I won't allow my personal concerns to hinder China's Four Modernisation. Our generation, so much time already wasted! Why won't you help us? Don't worry that I won't return. I have a video recorder, TV, fridge, air-conditioning! I have everything! Even a husband and a son! Well then, what's wrong with you? No... I no wrong. I right. My school right. My sponsor right. My family right. Why did you come to Shanghai? Why couldn't our Consulate in Guangzhou give you a visa? The lady... said... I'm too pretty. In the past, you've applied for a visa every 3 months. Why did you wait 6 months this time? I had a child. I make baby. Now I not beautiful. Please... Please let me go. Please! You had a baby. Is that your way of getting a visa? Did they issue it or not? That we cannot accompany each other as in China. My parents are very unhappy. Bei Yili, your grandmother is here. Hello, teacher. Zhao Xiao San, come here. Come on. Over here. Over here. Say goodbye to your teacher. Bye bye! Bye! A spoonful for grandma. A spoonful for Sansan. Come on, Sansan. A spoonful for Sansan. Nansan, any letter from Hung? Yeah. I didn't bring it along. Then bring it tomorrow. Hung has written less in the past two months. Postage is expensive! - We'll be off now. - You're leaving? Come here. Have you... paid off all your debts? Only the air ticket left. Come on... say goodbye to your grandpa! Bye bye. Bye bye! Hey, a letter for you! From your wife! Must cost a fortune, sending 7 letters in a month! She must be doing really well! Nansan, I can't stand it anymore. I want to come back. Is that all right? I got your letter. I know things are difficult. I'm worried about you. But finally, I think you shouldn't come back. This is for Sansan's future. No matter what, just don't come back. The headmaster is coming. Where's Teacher Zhao? Nansan, soon I'll have immigrant status. Arrange immediately our divorce. Send the document by express. Daddy... I don't want a divorce I want you. Play by yourself. Good boy. Therefore come back! Several letters to Hung were returned. Wonder why? They're on the table. Nansan, Old Kin next door said his VCR has sound but no picture. I don't have time. I'm going to Panama next month. Where did you get the money? Ah Qun is there. He owns a barber shop. He says repairing electric appliances makes good money. You can visit Hung on the way! I'll have to leave Sansan here with you. You are all wet. Who's holding my baby? Who's holding my little baby? Close your eyes Sweet dreams! You'll be in a big garden And there's a bed of red roses. A bed of red roses. Hey, Amigo! Bang bang! Ok, ok. Coming! Who's there? Shit! - Mu! - Nansan! Just got in? It's fun in New York! Just made a deal with a gallery. I'll move to a new 3000 sq. ft. apartment soon. Cheers! Welcome to New York! Where is Hung? She doesn't know I'm here. I want to surprise her. Wow! How romantic! I've known you for years, but never saw this side of you! So, did you come by taxi? - No, I walked. - Walked? It wasn't so bad. About five hours. Ok, I'll give you a real taste of America tonight, 14 ounces of fresh fat juicy steak! Mu, take me to see Hung first? Ach, okay! Have you seen Hung lately? Not much. This is New York, you know. Oh, yes. She came to my show's opening last month! Excuse me. Hung! Hi. John! Hey, congratulations! This is great. Absolutely great. - Hey, you look sensational! - Thank you! Peter, come over! I thought you said we'd get together. I'm so sorry. I'm really busy these days. - Ready? - Thank you! Nansan'll get a heart attack if he sees the photo. Hey, how's business? It looks really good. So so! By the way, you still live in that place in Brooklyn? Shall I tell you something, just between you and me. I'm working on this project. It involves... Well, it's supposed to be confidential. - Then don't tell me! - No... No, it's ok. Come here. You know, I'm working on this project, and it involves 100 million dollars. US dollars! And it can be even much more than that, you know. - It's, uh... - China trade! - Hey, Steve. Hi! - Hi, Hung Li. Ok, I really must go now. Let's have lunch next week, ok? Good luck. God bless you. - Ok. - Bye bye. - Hi... - Congratulations. Nansan! Must be a mistake. This looks like a storage facility. It isn't even fit for a dog! Anybody here? Hung, Hung? We're looking for a Chinese woman. Oh, yeah. That fucking Chinese pussy with the little tits and big arse. What did he say? Hey, you got 10 bucks, I'll show you what door. No, this guy is looking for his wife. - Hung! - Hey, you want a piece of arse? Honestly... Shut up you jerk. I paid for the room, so leave me alone... Hey, she used to live here before, but she moved out a long time ago. - What is he saying? - He said Hung has moved out. Hey, come on. Give me 10 bucks, and I'll tell you where your wife is. Hey, you - Chink. Out of my house! Hold it, hold it. I just want to know where this guy's wife is. You Italians and Chinese, always eating in the rooms. Eating cats and dogs. Easy, easy, easy. What is going on here? Where's Hung. Let's go. Hey, guys. I got some weed, got the herb. Always the same for those new here. When I first came I did portraits on 42 Street. No time, or place, even to have a piss! So I didn't drink any water. I did moving jobs when I was down and out. Painters ... our hands are strong! Now I'm doing OK. I have a contract with the gallery. Now, they give me food, and a place to live. Even a toilet to piss in. Not bad! - Now you can piss anytime you want. - Rubbish! It's hell! The gallery wants only Mongolian landscapes from me. Or they won't help with my immigrant application. They just made me their Xerox machine! - Where's Hung? - Moved out, I guess. Maybe she has disappeared? My friend, this is America. You don't need a Party member's approval to move. It's like eating pizza. You can have it 24 hours a day if you have money! This is what we call freedom. Ah Qun lent me money to get to Panama. He paid for my trip to Mexico. Those groups that smuggle people into the U.S. This guy took us across the border on foot. There were 15 of us. Four were arrested. One got to LA. I came here. The remaining 9... died. It was a scam. Mexican thugs were waiting to rob us. I only have... 9 dollars 25 cents, and 47 Chinese renminbi left! So long as you're here, you're my guest, OK? Don't give it a thought. Even if I have to sign a contract for 100 years, I'll help you find your wife. Cheers! Really, nine people died? Still remember when we painted at the Youth academy? You always forgot to paint Chairman Mao's mole, and had to copy Lao Tzu's articles as punishment. What's the matter? What's going on? I need my permanent residency. Can't have an illegal here. Sorry, Nansan! I still need to eat and pee. Little boy. Do you know, where to go, uh, Long Island? Long Island? All right. You're on Broadway right now. You've got to go downstairs, catch the No.1 train. Then you've got to go to Madison Square Gardens... - on 34 and 7th Avenue. - Slow! Then after that, you catch the Long Island railroad train. That's where it is. All right? Bye. Er, please... Do you... give me... water? - Wait. - One dollar. - No. I want water. No this. - This is water. Water. Do not give money. Nothing don't give money. You must be Communist. - What do you want? - I'll have a chocolate doughnut, please. I'll have a slice of cherry cheesecake. I should have one of those doughnuts too. It is very difficult in the beginning because everything is so unfamiliar. What? What are you doing? Hey, give me back my shoe! Mister, give me back my shoe! Wait. Stop. Stop! Hey, what are you doing here? Hi. I'm talking to you! Hung! Hung? Come on! Don't go to Chinatown! You just killed Mark. You know Mark? You're a piece of dead meat now. Jesus. So am I! Are you Chinese? Whoa... no Chinese, please. Do you speak English? Yeah. Er, no... no no. You've got nerve. Mark was a big boss in Chinatown. Are you from Toisan? You're dead now and still laughing? Which gang do you belong to? From Punyu, Sarwan village. Which village of Toisan are you from? Detroit. - Detroit? - Detroit. I'm an American. What's your name? Name? Oh. I'm Zhao Nansan. No, no, no. English please. I can't remember Chinese names. Zhao Nansan. - Lincoln. - What? - Lincoln chief. - Oh... Lincoln. Well, why not Washington, Reagan or Bush, then? I heard this story when I was little. Lincoln chopped down this tree. His father was upset, asked him if he did it. Lincoln admitted the truth. Most of our generation don't face up the truth. Ok, enough. Just tell me... Why did you go to Mark's place? I thought you were my wife. My wife. She looks a bit like you. Oh, give me a break! I'm young! That's all? Come on, tell me your story! I met my wife during Cult-Rev. Cult-Rev? What the hell is that? Cultural Revolution. Cultural Revolution. Oh! Revolution! How romantic! No. It's because our background wasn't good. We got sent to the countryside in Hainan Island. What background? Sent to the countryside? You're talking like you're E.T. You know E.T.? - E.T.? - Yeah, it's a - It's very small. It's kind of cute but... really ugly, you know? Ugly? Yeah. It's - Forget it. Tell me about your wife. She came here a year ago, by herself. Now she's disappeared. Oh... yes... Can you help me find her? Forget it! She probably met a new boyfriend. I change boyfriend every month. No! We even survived Cult-Rev. What is this Cult-Rev? Is it worse than AIDS? Help me... please. Really looking for her? Okay. Thank you. You're really something. What's your name? Jane. J-A-N-E. Jane. Aren't you too young to drive? Not young! I'm fifteen! One can drive here at fifteen? No. I don't have a licence. And I stole this car! Zhou? Yes, his surname is Zhou. He is Hung's sponsor. He is the nephew of Hung's parents' friends. Nephew? They've been here since 1949. Hi! Mr. Lincoln here is looking for Mr. Zhou. How do you do? I'm Hung's husband. Hey. Fuck you! He wasn't finished yet. No, don't do that, Jing! Jane! Jing! J... J... J... Jane. J... J... Ach, forget it. - Let's not offend them. - Why? - They are rich people, we can't - - So what? We're all human! Not dogs! Mr. Zhou, how do you do? I've never seen Li Hung! She phoned me once when she first arrived. Mr. Zhou, sorry... did she leave her address? The police came for her recently, but I don't know anything about it. What did the police want? What do you think you are doing? This is not your country! Behave yourself! Is Hung in trouble? What is he talking about? How did you come here? There's no way you could get the visa. Fuck you. That's none of your fucking business. I will call the police. Mr. Zhou! Fucking Chink! - No, no, no. - Fuck off! He was walking all over you! You - - Why? - Let's go. Leave me alone! Is it here? I'll go now. Should I? Goodbye. Do you know, er... school? School. School. What? What is he talking about? Do you know... 'escuela'? Oh! School! Yes! Do you really teach English here? Don't worry. My Hong Kong accent is very English. As long as I'm speaking ABC, not Do Re Mi, everyone should be very happy, because I'm expensive. I hope the one you're looking for is the one I taught before. I don't usually remember their names. She told me her name is 'E-lay'. I spent ten minutes teaching her to say 'Elaine' but she still calls herself 'E-lay'. I rarely mix with my students. You know we are all busy, making a living. But that one time, it was a real mess. More than half a year ago. Bastard! Trying to take advantage of me! You're crazy! Elaine! Calm down! Elaine. Please calm down! Elaine! Never... touch me! Never! He took advantage of me! He touched me! You bastard! Kill him! Take him to the Public Security bureau. What is the 'Public Security' bureau? It's something between the police, FBI, CIA. Secret police in China. So? We didn't call the police. That guy was an illegal immigrant. And I was also... illegal. How could we? Whoa! You're also illegal? I'm waiting for the amnesty. Actually your wife was over-reacting. That Spanish guy just wanted to have coffee with her. - Really? - Yeah. Later, things worked out okay. Elaine worked very hard. Never late to school. I... work... at... Chinese... restaurant. I work IN A Chinese restaurant. Yeah. ... in... a... Chinese... restaurant. In Harlem. Which part of Harlem? East side, or West side? On what Avenue, or what Street? Street? Yeah. One Hundre' Thirty Thir' Street. One Hundred Thirty Third Street. One Hundred Thirty Third Street. Very good. That's all I know. She hasn't come here for several months now. Where's Harlem? No. I'm not going there. She can't tell us anything else? Well... This is just another McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken. The students pay their tuition, learn a few words, and leave. I only do french fries. To recall her name as 'Elaine' is already quite amazing. She never mentioned me? What about our child? Oh sorry... she did say something once! You're still here? I saw this on the street. It seemed such a waste. Where do you live? - Bronx. - Bronx?? My husband and child will be here soon, and I don't have a bed. It's impossible! It's too far! Elaine! How are you going to cross the bridge? Thinking of my homeland. Not that it's the best... only that I cannot forget it. One can live anywhere. This is the only one on One Hundred and Thirty Third. Why don't you let me get out here? Why are we here? Come on! Hey... I'll come back to shower after I've found Hung. Hey... I'm not a virgin anymore. And there's hot water. My wife won't mind what I look like. Then let me cut off your nose! She loves you so much. Got the bed home for you. You have to look good for her! Sorry. You don't understand. You're still young! What? I'm still too young? I started taking pills at 10, my first. Abortion, you know. I had a baby girl last year! - Really? - Yeah. No kidding. Your parents don't worry about you? It's none of their business! They're divorced. I was brought up by grandpa. He knows nothing. Not even ABC. Where's your daughter? I don't know. There must be a welfare centre taking care of her. Why have a baby when you were so young? And not bring her up when you are her mother? It was an accident! It's not my fault! Not your fault? Your own flesh and blood! What's the big deal? I'm happy with what I've done and what I'm doing. Maybe I'm wrong, but I enjoy it. Maybe I'll regret it, but I'm the one who has to suffer. Not mum, not dad, not you. It's my life. Sorry. You don't have to go to school? I'm supposed to, but I don't want to. I came to New York to look for my boyfriend. But he went to Atlantic City. Is he your daughter's father? Maybe he's her dad. Who knows? Do you really understand what love is? Love. You're really something. This is love! Now, you go by yourself. I hate the smell of Chinese restaurants. When I was small my dad used to come back home once a week, with that smell all over him... in his hair, on his clothes. Go quickly. You've got to leave enough time for your wife tonight. How about you? We'll all sleep together tonight. What? You sleep with Hung on the bed. I'll sleep on the floor. I've got another room, ok? Then I owe you... How much does this room cost? Excuse me, is Li Hung here? What for? I'm her husband. - Do it again, no chicken for you! - All right, all right, all right. I'm telling you. These people, I don't understand. Come in. Thank you. Don't worry. This is a metal door, and the window is bullet-proof. Man, it's great in Harlem! - Hurry up! - Go. Black people are really not that scary. For example, every weekend the whole family goes to church. - They can be really sweet and warm. - Just hurry up. Down here we're all friends and neighbours. We live in harmony together. Deep inside, blacks are maybe better than whites. - At least they don't look down on us! - Damn, this old thing won't start! Other parts of Harlem are okay too. Not like here, a real dump. Drug pushers, pimps... Rent is cheap, that's why! When blacks are poor and drunk, they cause trouble. If I were drunk and poor, I'd cause trouble too! Oh, my baby sweetheart. Time for milk. Excuse me, I'm here to find Hung. Oh, yes. Any proof that you're her husband? Hung never told us she's married. Is she off today? You people from the mainland are really strange. You let your wife come here alone. No money, food, clothes, work, or home. All by herself! Meanwhile you spend the money that she sends home. Husband indeed! Now you bring flowers. Shame! - You don't understand. - What's not to understand? A woman, here in New York, with no support at all. We all have only one life, understand? When my period comes, and I can't afford tampons. Get it? Living in danger of being raped. Get it? Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Don't open the door! No! Rape! Help! Let her go! Police! Come on. Get her. Get her from behind. Don't go. Think of the danger. Come back inside! It's too dangerous. Come back in! - Hung. Hung, be quick! - Hurry up! Don't call the police. I'm illegal! We're moving out of Harlem within a year. We'll sell our shop to the mainlanders. When we've earned enough money, we'll open a small shop in Flushing. The Taiwanese Chinatown. Have you been there? Sweetheart, time for bed. The Taiwan immigrants these days are not like before. They don't wash dishes anymore! They're all professionals. Businessman, developers, property speculators. We're the last generation of poor university students. But where is Hung now? Gone! She hasn't been here for 3 months! - Any news of her? - None at all. Very well. - Goodbye. - Oh... yes! Two months ago I saw her in Brooklyn. She was with a - Brooklyn is New York's third Chinatown. It's dirty, poor, a real mess. Residents are all Chinese mainlanders. What a coincidence! We heard this appliance store is a real bargain. So we drove all the way out here. Took one hour! Better ask you first. Are they reliable? They're pretty good. I'm not really - Be careful! Many of the Taiwanese goods are bad! See you later! That man owns a laundry on 8th Avenue, one of those old-fashioned shops. Is 8th Avenue in Brooklyn? A woman who's run away... what do you want her back for? She's lost, like old bath water. Even if you get it back you won't use it - it's dirty! Please, how do I get to Brooklyn? Now that you are here, don't rock the boat! Lay low for a while, there's bound to be an amnesty. We can use an extra pair of hands. - No, it's not that... - Not what? You're luckier than the 1 billion in China! A few years of hard work, then open your restaurant, marry a fine woman. Have lots of kids. No one here cares how many. Look at me! Working on my PhD thesis for more than 10 years! No one can rush me. Cheers! For a better future. Thanks for the tea. I have to go. Good bye. My pleasure. Don't forget your flowers! Still drinking! Where's that suitcase? Oh yeah! I'll go and get it! We saw her last about 3 months ago. She hadn't come to work for a week. And she didn't have a phone at home. Hung? Hung? Hung?! Hung! Hung? Ugh. He's drunk. Go carefully. Which is her room? It should be D. This one is C. Ah, there's D. It's too dark here. Can't see properly. Hey - here it is! Hung? Hung? Let me try. It's open. Go away! What's wrong? Are you sick? Have you got a temperature? Oh, you're sweating so much. It's humid here. Doesn't matter. This is the basement. You're not well! I'll go back to work tomorrow. There's no fresh air here. You should go see a doctor. Why don't you change your room? There's not even a bathroom here. You can't live like this. Let's go out to stretch our legs. Come on. I don't want to. I just want... to sleep some more. My suitcase... please take care of it for me. People steal things when I'm asleep. Of course we can. All my precious belongings are inside. Please take care of it for me. Jane! Jane! Jane? Jane. What do you want? Jane? Jane! Jane. Jane. Jane. Jane, how do I get to Brooklyn? - No, no, no, get out of here. - Son of a bitch. You bastard! - You son of a bitch! - Get off me! - Jane, what's going on? - Two hundred! - Get off! - You arsehole! Come on! I didn't fuck your mother first - Get off. Get off. - Oh no. - Ah ha! - What are you doing? - What's this? - Oh, my wallet! - Visa! - Fucking bitch! - Gold card! - What are you doing? - Wallet! You stole my wallet, you fucking bitch! - Shoot him! - Huh? - Where's your Magnum 44? - What? Use your handkerchief! Handkerchief? Holy shit! Hey - what are you doing here? I'm conducting business. You know? Oh, I see. You want to have sex. Made in USA! My boyfriend always complains that it's too big, you know? Go fuck your wife! You're too much! Don't be so serious! Hey, Lincoln... you want me to take you to Brooklyn, right? You don't drink, you don't smoke, you don't eat, you don't piss. You live like a priest. You... stop following me around. You... it's this way! Hey, Lincoln, be honest, I don't believe you haven't screwed around! You must check out women's tits when you're out and about! Yes or no? Do you masturbate? My boyfriend calls it 'Shoot the plane'. Do you? I see. No wonder your wife left you! It's closed for the day! Hey! There's a guy inside. Come on! Don't be shy. Is Hung here? I'm her husband. Her husband on the mainland. Yeah... he's made in China. Come on. You'd better talk. Or do I have to get Brother Wei and his shotgun?! What's wrong with you? Get out! Sorry! Hold it. Don't try anything silly. This whole thing wasn't my fault! Cantonese woman looking to marry. 28 years old, unmarried, high school education, 5' 5" urgently looking for man under 50 with Green Card. Phone Li 210. I responded to her advertisement. A meeting was arranged at the Confucius Statue. Later we had tea together. We hardly spoke to each other. No way she could have fallen for me! She's beautiful, and cultured. That was it. We didn't meet again. Until... one freezing winter day. So cold! Uh, sit, sit, sit! Sit, sit. Marry me! Help me get my residency. We get married at once. No love involved! But I'll take good care of you. And I won't seek a divorce within 10 years. I could even have a son for you. How's that? Like my proposal? Congratulations! It's a very simple procedure! Take your ID or passport, and register at City Hall. I'll check the Chinese calendar for a good wedding date. There's a church on 42nd Street for western weddings. No, no! A Chinese wedding! A simple Chinese wedding is fine! - A simple wedding?! - Yes! Will it be a problem if my passport says I'm married? Later, she got a divorce agreement somehow. I understand these days you can buy one. All done! Move in tomorrow when the paint is dry. Fine, fine. Thank you! Be sure to come early tomorrow! You old fellow. Your wedding night, and still painting your house! Let's practise with him! He has to perform tomorrow night. Come on, then! She took the money for the new furniture... and the money for the honeymoon. We were planning to go to the Niagara Falls. I haven't been anywhere these thirty years. It is heaven's will. Why didn't you call the police? Hey - goodbye! What day is today? What? Once you get married, You'll be imprisoned... When will it be your turn? Not so soon! Hey, Lincoln, wake up! Come on! Eat! Hey, Lincoln. This is my boyfriend Mike. Where is Hung?! - Good evening. - Hi. Hello. I want study in America. I have money, no sponsor. Please! Oh, I don't think we can help you. You'd better go and speak to the American Consulate. - Write name! - I'm very sorry. Okay? Okay? Please! I'm sorry. Goodbye. Mister. Mister. I have money. Many money. No sponsor. You sign, for me? - Sponsor. - No, no, no. - Have money. - No thank you. - Mister. - No, thank you. Mi - Don't ever order me around again! But I pay for the apartment! I pay for everything else. Your beer, your toilet paper. But you didn't pay for the fuck. Thinking of my homeland Not that it's the best Only that I cannot forget it One can live anywhere That's all I've got. That's it. Not even enough for tips. You'll still keep on looking for Mrs. Lincoln? Well, I've got no place to go. Or shall I go back to Detroit? No! Not my dad again. You know... I didn't have a happy childhood. At that time, my parents were still together. My mum wouldn't let me do anything. Used to beat me up... with a bamboo duster. My legs had red marks all over them. I ran away from home at six. I hated having Chinese parents. I hated being Chinese. I hated speaking Chinese. I even dyed my hair green and red and yellow... so I wouldn't look like a Chinese. Now I'm happy. Now I'm free. I don't even mind speaking Chinese with you. You're really something! Hey, are you listening? No more looking for Mrs. Lincoln. Look for money! We got no money, silly boy! Hey... How much is it to spend the night with me? $150. Hey, Lincoln. Bye. Hey. Chinese little girl. Fifteen years old. Beautiful, clean, and sexy. One hundred fifty.

Is she okay? - I... I want to come back, immediately. - Huh? - Immediately. - You - You don't have to worry. Mum, mum... can you hear me? Nansan, don't come back! Not unless you're starving to death. Or you're terribly ill. Don't come back! Nansan, absolutely don't come back! We're old, got nothing to lose. We'll take care of Sansan! Please deposit $7.20 for the next 3 minutes... or your call will be disconnected. Please deposit $7.20 for the next - I'm sorry. All right. I think I'd better go home. No fun here. I want to go back to school. I can survive with a part-time job. You lasted seven days with only one doughnut. What are you going to do? New York has got millions of illegal immigrants. They can't catch you even if they try for a hundred years. Okay, Lincoln? Bye. I'll miss you. Thank you. You can keep the change. - Thank you. - Bye bye. (sings first line of "My Motherland", a song popular in Communist China) Nansan... When did you arrive? I've been here for... a month. Why didn't you tell me earlier? I wrote you many letters! Why didn't you reply? Some sweet ginger before tea for your bad stomach.. You'll catch cold! Don't know if you ever received my letters. I knitted all these for Sansan. You like them? I don't even know how big he is now. Oh, some are bigger. So big. Oh, this one is for you! Try it! Don't take it off. It's getting colder now! - You want some egg custard? - I don't - Took a long time to find this tape. Helps me get to sleep each night. SONG: "My Motherland" - by Guo Lanying No one to keep me company... and I can't go back home. I saved them all for Sansan... If only you'd come earlier. There were lots more. I had a whole suitcase... completely full... of toys. There was a Donald Duck, very cute. But not any more. I got 2 jackets for you. They'd suit you well. I can't find them. I lost them when I moved. I didn't even know you'd moved. All my letters to you were returned, and I didn't have your new address. You're lying! I wrote you tons of letters! I wrote to you before I moved, and after I moved! No. I never received them Impossible! No! Someone must have taken them. Just like before, checking and keeping our letters They couldn't have been checking all this time. I really sent them! Did anyone follow you? No. Anybody eavesdropping? I'm scared! They sent a lot of agents here, and I'm all alone! Why? We haven't done anything wrong. I don't know. I was hoping, once I got residency, I could apply for you and the baby to come over! All right. How did you get here? Was your visa approved? I was worried about you. I came in illegally. Nansan, don't go! Don't leave me alone! I'm so scared! I won't. I know it's very hard for you. Hung... Good morning. Good morning! Going to class now? Shut up! You're not supposed to speak Chinese here in my apartment. Is that clear? Hung, what's wrong? Shut up, you fucking stupid Chink. Speak English. This is United States of America, ok? Hung, what's wrong? Fuck off! Who do you think you are? Do you want me to pay for the night? Hung? My God! How could I pick up an arsehole like you? Hung! Lock the door when you get out, Chink! Hung! Your son said he got the passport, and he thanks you for your help. He got it. Yes, didn't I tell you that everything would be fine? Ah, everything's fine. But policies in China are changing. The officials are not happy. Not happy. Yes. So, don't delay to buy him the plane ticket, so he can come now. He's here already. No, not yet! You have to buy an air ticket first, and send it to him. I can get it for you at a discount, much cheaper! Oh, you can get it for me? Right! We should go to the bank to get the money! What do you think? Oh, get money. I'm going to Guangzhou next month. Want me to bring money to your nephew's daughter? Things are getting expensive. Not easy to get through. You speak Mandarin, though, don't you? Oh, not very well. I don't speak Chinese very well either! I tried out for the lead in this - I've discussed it with the village cadre. Shouldn't be a problem, although that mountain is state-owned. But he hopes you can help fix the road first. Do you get it? Your village is very poor. Still no electricity or street lights. Let's go to the bank, and send money home. Hung! What do you want? I'm Nansan! Hey, are you crazy? Hung, I'll take you to the doctor! What the fuck do you want? Hung, don't! Get off. Get off me! I'm Nansan! Your husband! We have a child - Sansan! - Hung... - No... We met in Hainan, during the Cultural Revolution! - Do you remember?! - Get off! - Help! - Hung. - Help. Help! - Hung! Hung! I know it's been hard. Let's be together! Fuck off! Fucking cunt. We still have a child Sansan. He's waiting for us! We'll start all over again! Hung, can you hear me?! Let's go back to China - Let go. Son of a bitch. He tried to rape me. Help. Help. Help me. - He's mainland Chinese. - I'm Nansan! He tried to rape me. Help! - You're Hung! - Someone help me. Somebody help me! Help. Help. We have a child called Sansan. - No! - Hung! Please! No. - Just go! - I'll take you to the doctor! - Hung! - No. Don't. No! - Hung! - No. Fuck off. Get off me. Fuck off, you murderer. Get off me! "Serve the People" (Cultural Revolution slogan) Nansan. Nansan. Sansan. Nansan. Thinking of How each day passes and I sow For the sake of my children That they might be given the best education To live freely and grow up a complete person Thinking of who would want to leave one's homeland I only want to return sooner Time, please wait awhile Chinese people are born with unbounded patience.
