Do you always wake up so early? Yes. At 5. Oh, come on. And I go to bed at 5. What a strange weather! Bright sunshine after the snow. OK, see you! Wait, anybody new with him? I don't know. And the girl with braids? No idea. Thanks, Eteri. See you. You've scared me! - Good morning. - Good night. You've spent the whole night in front of a computer, haven't you? I want more. - Come here. - What's this? - Piss. - Who did this? Surely not me. It's the dog. Pisses everywhere. - Why? - Your foot. The dog's old. Come here. I never see you these days. You're locked up in your room. - What's this? - The boots. It doesn't hurt. Come on! Oh, Manana! - Show me the other foot. - I have to take a bath anyway. Give it to me. Take off this hat! What? Your hair looks awful! The hat. It's not about the hat. The hair needs dying and washing. You've got lots of gray hairs. Look! You need to take care of yourself. I'll finish the book and then. You are a woman, aren't you? Come here, look at yourself! Shit! We need to change the wiring! Any pieces of glass in your head? Do you remember what day it is today? You're finishing the book, aren't you? Yes, sure. And reading it to us. Yes. I'm exhausted. I'm gonna sleep now. Come kiss me! You still keep writing on your arms? I asked you not to. But I forget things. Buy a notepad and make notes there. People will think you are crazy! Buy something from the stationery store. Buy a notepad and something pretty. Some clothes, a blouse, something tight. You look awful in these clothes, as if you have no breasts. You deliberately make yourself ugly. - What's the matter, are you depressed? - Just the contrary. That's good. I don't need a notepad. I can't use it. I forget to make notes. But I always see the notes on my arm. And how about the blouse? Later, I don't have time now. Tomorrow! Tomorrow! Sure. Why don't you go out with your friends and have fun? I'm writing a book. - Are the children asleep? - Yes. Broken glass! Sergi, Toma! Get up and take the dog for a walk! Hello. There's brothel next door, isn't there? You mean the man with the mustache? Yes. He's brought some slut again. That man is a maniac. I greeted him, and he turned his back. Why the hell did you greet him? He's been our neighbor for years. I never greet him. What are you reading? It's my favorite writer. My favorite writers sometimes write bad books too. If I love the author, I don't care what he writes. I like everything. I thought.. people loved authors for their books. But you might be interested in the author's personality more. To hell with author's personality, who cares about that, if the author is not my wife, of course. I miss Mom. I miss Mom too. Me too. You mean your Mother? My Mother, and your Mother and your Mother too. - I miss your Mother too. - So do I! This evening all of us are home. She's reading it to us today! She's been writing non-stop for so long! Let's pretend we are interested. I am really interested. I've brought it! - What is it? - Nothing, some paint. Cloudy, windy weather, empty hippodrome, the boys walk beside each other. Wait, I can't read it now. OK, I'll leave it, then. Wait.. Are you telling it to your family today? If you don't tell them, I will. - I will explain everything. - I can do it myself, no problem. There is a problem, - isn't there? - Yes, there is. You said they are educated and smart, they aren't stupid, are they? Yes. No. That's good. - All right. - Manana! You have written a masterpiece. You are a genius! You haven't read it to the end. I can see it from the very first pages. What if they throw me out of the house? - Excuse me! - So what? You can live here. You can move in today! Excuse me! Your phone! At last! How are you? Fine. You look good. Thanks. Where's your key? I didn't expect you'd go out. Sometimes I do. Have you finished? I think so. Is it good? Maybe, I'm not sure. Mom, give me the coat. Are you feeling OK? Yes. I'll go lie down. Quiet, please. There's no need to shout. What? I've come for the reading. You were shouting, you know. She's asleep. Hey, Manana. Manana, what's going on? He's a friend of mine. The cashier from the stationery shop? I'm not a cashier. I'm the owner. I'm a literary critic and the editor of Manana's book. Sure. I don't understand why he's angry. - He's usually like that. - I had no idea you were friends. We cannot call it friendship. We have a business relationship. I have not told them anything yet. What? You should have prepared them. They'll be shocked. We have to tell them in advance. I thought about it, but, you know, I'm doing it without any preparation. Maybe you are right. - It'll save us some time. - Are you hungry? Yes, I am. It needs more salt. The dream scene is fantastic! How you paint it! I was swept away completely. I still don't know for sure, whether I really read it or fell asleep in my armchair and dreamt it. Manana? Are you OK? You seem a little inadequate. Do I? Can't you just explain what's going on, instead of hiding in the corner and whispering something to a stranger? We will read the book, and you'll understand everything. What is there to understand? Manana, I'm asking you. Why did you leave the dog out?! I glance at the window and freeze. The sun, cut in two halves, sets beyond the horizon. The window turns black. I can't stand it anymore. I tear off the upper layer of the skin, off my face, and walk to the front door. I have to leave this house. Into the black rectangle. Fear. A slippery meat on the sofa, my husband. He's so slippery, I can't hold him. His perfume poisons my dreams. Nightly, eyes bloodshot, I breathe it. He is looking at me. His fishy eyes are torn and condensed, turquoise salty water is pouring out. And then it shrunk. And now I have to clear it up again. I'll squeeze it into the basket, with the dirty pants of my elder one and light blue socks of the younger one. He manages to flee from me. He slowly slips away from the room. I have to leave this house. The dog walks along the corridor. It's head is so heavy, it drags it across the floor. Old age drips from it as urine. I scrub the sticky stain off the tiles with my sucked-out breasts. It must be honey, dripped from the lips, staring at the TV. I must leave this house. Leaving, I stumble over my children, grown out of the floor. These two weeds, always on my way. One wraps around my ankle, the other reaches towards my thigh. I tear them off with a rough kick. Yesterday, in the kitchen, they emerged from the ceiling and dripped into my coffee, formed oily circles on the surface and I sipped them they stuck to my front teeth. At sunset, they fell as oblique shadows on the newly-papered walls whispering me to feed them. But my double chin is hanging heavily. I'm afraid the tumor will branch out in metastases, I opened my mouth and let out a cry, but they couldn't catch the frequency of my voice. The time has come for me to move aside, into the black rectangle. Fear. It's dark in the neighbor's flat, but the red of his skin is in my eyes. He is a pink bubblegum, drenched, gulped down and stuck in the stomach. The woman is a medusa with 105 brown dreadlocks. My moaning makes them come alive. Swaying in the breeze, one by one, they slip into my vagina, first, second, third, second, twenty-ninth, sixth, ninth. - Forty-seventh. - It's enough. - Enough! Manana! Stop it! - It's a masterpiece! You don't get it and you never will! This is a fiction, not an autobiography. You know nothing of human psyche, the protagonist and the author may be alike, yet, not the same person. One can imagine anything, just anything! Fantasy has no limits, but you are close-minded! Manana, do tell him to leave! You will kill her, you will kill Manana! You are boxed in a vacuum! You are all alike! I warned you they wouldn't get it! I did! Manana, tell him to go. - This is our family matter. - No! This is not your family matter! This is a matter of national importance! This is a new literature, a novelty, yes, this is a sexual revolution! This is the door, for you to leave, and you go through this window if you don't get out from that door. Why are you laughing like an idiot?! How dare you call Manana an idiot?! - I said, leave my flat! - I'm not going anywhere! I'm staying! I'm gonna protect Manana. Listen, this is ridiculous. Say something, Dea, I think your Mom's gone mad. Come with me for a moment, please, we need to talk. We'd better talk in private. OK, go. Thank you. What you have just read is a disaster. I don't know why you wrote it. Don't you realise how creepy it is? Yes, but it's not an autobiography. Don't repeat that psycho's words! I know you love me and our children although you hate us in the book. But it's not about you. Wait a minute. Is this the only printed copy? Yes, it is. And only you have the file? Yes. Listen. You are very talented and write well. It's not easy to write a book, I know. But please, start writing something new choose any subject. You can have that room for yourself. I can sleep in the loggia. We can cook and tidy the rooms. You can write as much as you want, no one will disturb you. I can't explain it. You know, it was very important for me, that someone would read it. One person did read it to the end, your friend, and he keeps calling you a genius. Listen, that scene with the sex with dreadlocks? Why? How did this idea occur to you? I don't know. I thought it was funny. I imagined a very unhappy woman. How would her family react? They would be completely shocked. I thought how the woman's life would go on afterwards, how it would end. But I still don't have the ending. Something is missing. Something's still missing. What are you doing, Manana? I have never told you about this. About what? It all started when you replaced the tiles. Once I was having a bath and I saw a Martini glass.. Look! That guy was holding exactly the same glass in Tallinn, but I've never told you about him. Anyway, and here, in another rectangle I see a couple kissing each other. The woman is wearing a uniform. Look, a white hat and an apron, with her head bent on the side, and kissing the other. Look. In this one, someone is on the hippodrome, look what a scene! Incredible! And in this one, there's a woman's back, her hair is tied, she's talking to the other figure. Look, how vivid her features are. If you look at it from a distance, there is a face. And in this one a man is walking in the street, can't you see? Look, he's moving, he's alive! Are you nuts? You need treatment for hallucinations. - No, just look at it carefully! - No! I'm not interested! Manana, I've told you a hundred times, you can live in my shop, your room is ready, there are papers and pens. Do come, can't you hear me? My jacket and bag, please! Manana! How feverishly she used to write, my little fool. You keep concealing things. Had you shown it earlier, we'd have told you our opinion, and you wouldn't have wasted the time. It's cold, let's go inside. Leave it to burn down by itself. You've been missing it, haven't you? My fluffy bed. I've spent so many nights on that awful sofa. She should've told us from the start what she was writing about. - I would've burnt it immediately. - She knew you would. That's why she hid it from you. Dea! It's gonna burst! Are you crazy? It's freezing! You'll catch a cold. Get inside. Manananggal. What? It's the name of a mythical creature in the Philippines. An ordinary woman that turns into a horrible monster at night. It gets torn apart, leaves the lower part, gets huge wings, bat-like ones, and flies to hunt. It sucks blood from pregnant women and feeds on embryos, a terrible creature. It makes a ticking sound and approaching its victim, gets silent. In my childhood she used to tell me myths instead of fairy-tales. My mother and I was especially afraid of this creature. I dreamed I was that creature. I came here, to this balcony, at night. I got torn in half. I left my lower part here, I grew huge wings... and went hunting. My wings were beautiful, transparent, with thick veins... in the moonlight. I flew and hunted. It was a strange sensation of absolute comfort and happiness. I moved my wings vigorously and made some inhuman sound. There is still tension in my throat. But, while I was hunting, you crept onto the balcony. With fistfuls of salt. You carefully approached my lower part that was standing on the balcony, and poured salt on it. The flesh let out a horrible sizzling sound. I turned around and flew away, weeping. I knew I would die, I knew I'd lose all my strength and fall. I let out.... an inhuman.... an inhuman cry, and... Didn't you hear me... yelling in my sleep? Manana... Manananggal. It's not funny. But this was not the end of the dream. I don't want to hear more. What is it, Dad? What happened, Dad? Dad? Your mother has scared me to death. She told me about some nightmare she had last night. What? She looked insane. She was telling it in a funny way. Even her voice was strangely altered. She said she was a creature... that sucked blood from pregnant women, she flew... and hunted and felt happy. It's completely insane. I don't know... what to think... or to do. Dea, is anything wrong? Nothing, son. Let's have breakfast together. I'll go get something. You don't have to. Stay. No, I'm used to this rhythm. Manana, they are asking for your photo. - What? - I need your photo. - What for? - For a publisher. - A publisher? - Yes, when you gave me a sign, I ran there and handed it to them. - What? - The photocopied book. But I didn't give any sign to you. You probably don't remember. Anyway, I'll publish the book at any cost! What about your father? - Is he translating? - Father... I've completely forgotten about him. I'll ask him. Take the photo today! I'm sure they will publish the book. What about Anri and the children? Manana, we both knew this would happen. We were ready for this. This was the only option. There were other options too. You have your own way. It's up to them whether they support you or not. I can feel your book. I feel the smell of its pages! Your book exists! I've left the store open. Don't forget to take the photo. What has brought you here? Have you translated it? Yes. Father, I told you there's no hurry. Have you read the book? No. I spent sleepless nights. I have never translated anything with so much pleasure. You know I'm open-minded, but I have never met such a filthy author. The text is ingenious and obscene at the same time. Is the author a female? No. I want to meet him. I have a few questions about some scenes in his book. He will meet me, right? He hasn't contacted me yet. He will. But first he should send me the ending. Sure, he will. You look thin, your skin is transparent, I can see your veins. Don't you eat anything? You look thin too. Don't you eat anything? Are you a parrot?! I asked you first, so answer me. Why don't you hire a caretaker? Why are you asking? Do you think I need one? Why are you laughing? Haven't you thought of a caretaker? Leave me alone, and let me work. I've bought something for you. I don't need anything. I'm well. Get them, quick! What is it, Mom? - Let me help you. - I made it! It's OK. At last, now I feel the family vibe. It's nice. From tomorrow on, let's have breakfast together, let's get up earlier. There is something really nice about it. Is it an earthquake? No, darling, no earthquake. What's wrong with you? Look, I've got a new application on my phone. It shows how you'll look in old age. - How awful! Is that you? - Yes. Delete it! - Delete it now! - Take my picture too. Do you know the name of this cake? - No. What is it? - Earthquake. Really?! Why call cake Earthquake?! No idea. They opened a new bakery next to school. You visited your father? Yes. On some business, or...? No, just. How is he? Fine. We haven't seen him for ages. I want to ask you something, later. - Come here, Mom. - I don't want it! Take it away! I don't want to! No! I asked you not to! Excuse me. Leave her alone. Can't you see she doesn't like it? Let's go to the balcony. Let's go to the other one, then. No, it's better here. No, let's go there, there's better lighting. Come on. Come, stand here, yes. Look that way, that way! Take care, darling. I'll be back soon. What did she need the photos for? She said, for a Facebook account. Good, she'll make new friends and have some fun. Elevator's broken, let's take the stairs. Wait here. Come in! Just finished it. Paint has not dried yet. Why red? Hello? Dad, it's me. She left her phone at home. Dad! Dad, come, quick. Just come home at once! Open! I said open it! What do you want? There's a closet there! - Leave my shop. - Where is she? - Sleeping. - What? She's asleep. Wait, where are you going?! Stop! Don't! She's sleeping. Manana. - Manana! - She is a heavy sleeper. - Go out. - It's my shop. - I said go out. - I won't. It's my shop. Manana! "Moved to the stationery shop. Mom" What's this? Please stop laughing. I can hardly control myself. Just get up and come home. I sure will, but later. I need time. I'm writing. What? Something new? Yes, something new. You are lying. Since when have you started lying? Write whatever you want, but come home. I can't write at home. I'll move to the loggia again. The bedroom is yours. I can't write in the bedroom. I can't explain it. I need some other place, some new environment. I can't write in the old place. I'll rent an apartment for you. You'll be all alone. You can come home whenever you want. Just leave this place, don't disgrace me. No. Stop it... this is something different. I have to be here while writing. Have you lost your mind? Stop imagining things! Come home. I would understand it if you were Franz Kafka or someone like that. But you write cheap pornography thinking you're a genius. Aren't you ashamed? Instead of taking care of the children, you write terrible things about them. The boys don't say anything, but you think all this has not affected them? Or me? I think... you need psychiatric treatment. But, if you come home with me now, I'll try to forget everything and go on living with you as if nothing happened. Once we tried and it worked. Didn't you enjoy having breakfast together this morning? Or were you already planning moving? I took some money from your wallet. What money? I'll return it for sure! Let's bet! It's not funny! Not funny! Stop it now, Manana! Stop it! - I must close the shop! - Sorry? I have to go home. I can't leave the store open. Manana, I'll call the mental hospital, they'll tie you up and drag you away. You want that? Stop it now and come home. Manana, come home. I'm staying here, Anri. Listen, if you stay here, you lose your family. I'll finish the book and come back. No, it's now or never. - Please. - Don't laugh. Stop laughing or I'll lose control! You are careless like your dad! And crazy like your mom! Sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned your Mom. Anyway, are you staying here? Are you?! Yes. I'll call the police! At last! We've got rid of your family! Don't worry, Manana. He loves you. He's just an ordinary man with low intellect. Don't worry. Go on writing. I'll lock the shop. Here's the key in case you want to go out from the back door. - Who is the owner? - I am. How can I help? Free computer? Not at the moment. There will be one in ten minutes. - And a printer? - Yes, we have a printer. You can sit here. I thought you were out for a walk. Manana, I have to close early today. I have things to do. The back door key is on the table. Sorry, I'm late. It's OK. We've already ordered juice for you. If you don't like it, we can get a new one. - I prefer tea. Hot one. - OK, then tea, please! - Black. - Black! Black and hot. This is a new copy. All right. No need to hurry. Relax. OK, Nukri, I'll be frank with you. The answer is no. I simply can't. We can't publish it. - But... - No buts, Nukri. In a nutshell, this is pornography, lewd, obscene text. That's what it is. I can't believe it. You call it pornography. Have you read it? - Sure I have. - Have you really? - Yes, I have! - Have you read it all? OK, no, just several pages, but that was enough for me to decide whether I would publish it or not. - You are mistaken. - Am I? - Yes, you are. - That's your opinion. Listen, you are wrong. - Listen. - I'm listening. I'll wait here, you sit and read it. just for the sake of our friendship. It's only 150 pages, come on. Nukri, darling. We have been friends, well, at least acquaintances, for ages. I respect those years and I am sorry, but I can't waste time on this. I know for sure that my attitude won't change, - even if I read it to the end! - Believe me. It is a masterpiece. - You call it a masterpiece? - Yes, a masterpiece. I understand, it may be hard for you to realize that. - It is. - Look at it from different angle. Which angle? You usually publish stupid things. You publish everything in fact. I can understand that, but... Don't you realize you are insulting me? So I publish stupid things? - Yes, you do! - And this is a masterpiece?! To tell the truth, yes. This is only your truth, not mine, or Nino's, or anybody else's. - Are you sure? - Yes. I know for sure, and it is the truth. Nunu, listen, I have been... I've been going to various publishers for months, every single day. And? You know.... What did they say? You're the last one. Please publish it. That means they all rejected it. Maybe your truth is a lie after all! How can you call it the truth if it's just your opinion and nobody shares it? What do you mean? I am not alone! Who else is with you? My author. An author! You call her an author! She's a psychopath! I cannot call her anything else. Don't be so hard on him, he's about to cry. What is it? - What are you doing, Nukri? - I'm leaving. - Where are you going? - Home. I'll give you a lift. Do you live far? I do live far. But even if I lived close, I wouldn't ask you for a lift. - All right. - You're gonna regret this! At least drink your tea. This way. Be careful! Come. Careful! This is it. - This one? - Yes. Take a look! Not bad. It used to work very well, it still does, I guess. No parts are missing. - Good, I'll take it tomorrow, then. - OK, in the morning. Thank you! Great! - Nice. - Nice indeed. - Thank you! - Hope it serves you well. What the... Hey! Come here! Come here. Show me your hands! Open up your fists! Go on! Get out of here or else! Move! Surprise! Come in! - Hello! - Hello, Zura, how are you? Happy birthday to Manana. I love this place! Haven't been here for ages! Where's Manana? Shopping, she'll be back soon. - Who is this, Zura? - My grandchild. Please, feel at home. - Who are they? - Mother's friends. Treat them. There's nothing to treat them with! They brought some cakes. Go lay the table. Remember, it's her birthday? Yes. - Go to the guests. - What to say about Mom? I told them she's out shopping. But that means she'll be home soon! I know. Go! Where have you been? Manana? Hello! I didn't even remember. Thank you. If I'm late, lock the shop. Manana's here! I'll open it. Hi, Manana! Happy birthday! Getting older, huh? Manana! Happy Birthday! Excuse us for a second. Manana, can I have a word with you? You look terrible! You need a good wash. Don't you ever look into the mirror? I'm doing a research - for my book. - I don't care. I slipped on some rocks... - and fell down... - I don't care. - It's true... - I do not care. Take a shower and come to your guests. Do you hear me? The ending. The ending. The ending. We couldn't find any of your clothes. Take my dress. Keep it if it fits you. Come on! Down! Careful! Careful! Stop! Turn it to your side! Down! Down! Stop! Down! More! Down! More! Yes! Good job! Thanks! What's this? It's a present. Your birthday present. What is it? A printing machine. A relative gave it to me. Now we will have our publishing-house. Keep writing, no one will bother you. You know what that means? We can print and publish whatever we want! Can I... make a call? Hi, Dad. How are you? The author has added some details and sent them to you. Call him tomorrow. You can't call him at this late hour. Write down the number. I found Manana's childhood diaries. I want them to be a birthday surprise. I just remembered I had them. She used to write a lot. Somehow, I hadn't read them until now. Her mother kept them. I love one story... about a Centaur. She made the illustrations too. I'll leave this here for you to read. You'll discover many interesting things. What are you doing here? Where is she? Come, I'll show you. There she is, at the stationery shop. Hello! Hello? Yes? Manana, your father is calling. He wants to talk to the author. Arrange a meeting. Yes. Yes, it's me. All right. Where and when shall we meet? Thank you. See you later. I have to wash myself. He wants to meet in the café next to his place, at four. You want to bathe here? Author. Translator. First of all, I'd like to congratulate you. This is the most courageous and profound text of all the modern texts I have read recently. The narration is very unusual. It's really something. You creep into... the hidden corners of human consciousness and discover something we're all too scared to face. The protagonist, that woman. Her transformation is so interesting. From an ordinary housewife she turns into a real monster. The husband is also interesting. And the shop owner. And the mother! She's absent... yet present. She is like a shadow haunting her. A very interesting line. But... I don't like the father. Why is he so weak? Why is he there anyway? What is his function? He is not worth being in such a strong novel. No way. Let's think of more interesting things. You can show how the woman suffers from the lack of fatherly attention. The problem started in her childhood. The lack of love and attention has turned the woman into a monster. Father was not interested in her life. He was too busy doing his own things. Once he raises his head from the desk and finds the girl has grown up and turned into a woman who is in love with someone not worth of her, someone who will never understand her. Father knows she will suffer. But... she marries the guy, kills her real personality and turns into a devoted housewife. However, her restrained desires... eventually burst out! Self-realization occurs at a wrong time. That's why it happens in an ugly way. Instead of becoming a beautiful bird and spreading her wings, the woman turns into a bat-like monster, a truly ugly being! That's why she gets literally dirty, covered with mud. I have to ask you to cut out some parts. No way. Believe me, cut them out. The reader will be less irritated. No, less is always worse. In case of an overdose, less is good. No. I'd definitely... cut out the sex scene. No... If she hadn't slept with her neighbor, they wouldn't have kicked her out. I'm not talking about the neighbor. I'm talking about the scene where she has sex with the shop owner. Don't hurry. Wait... Just think it over. I was horrified by this episode. I feel sick whenever I remember it. Is there a prototype? Did you invent that man, or does he really exist? Of course he exists, and so do your husband and children. No, it's not about them, I never thought I'd have to explain that to you. Stop it! It's them! Anri, Sergi and Toma. Does that man exist too? Yes. Who is he? Nukri, my friend. Does he know you've written about him? I'll read it to him today. What will you read to him? Your diary? Manana, you have absolutely no imagination. You keep writing diaries, adding some mythical creatures. Answer me, does Nukri have long white hair on his back? Black teeth? Greasy skin? Does he wear underpants? Does he cry during orgasm? Answer me! Do you realize how Nukri will react when he reads this? Think about it! Use your imagination if you got any. Just a little bit. It's too easy in his case. Manana! I am afraid. The ending of the book is not real. In fact, it's the beginning of something horrible, do you realize that? Are you ready for it? You are running away from your childhood traumas. You blame me, but you do exactly the same to your children. They will turn into monsters too. That woman is dangerous. She is capable of everything. The main character in the novel is Fear. This woman is afraid of everything. Fear has killed her love and turned her into a monster, into this Manananggagagal-something. She keeps searching for a victim, she keeps hunting and sucking everyone's blood, devouring everyone alive, taking advantage of every situation. What are you doing? What's written on your arm, psycho? I think I've found the ending. Thank you. No, I am not the ending. You are mistaken. Have you come here for the ending? Answer me. Don't make me translate the scene of your mother hanging herself.
