Instead of repaying the amount... They will be allowed to serve one year... Or join the self defense force to bring about world peace. They should just quit with that nonsense! It's not necessary to force everyone to join right? The government intends to find solutions... For the shortage of self defense careers and members. On the other hand... Even if you don't go to college... Men should find a job that suits them and create their own world! Isn't that right big bro? Yeah... Huh? Do you disagree with me big bro? I-I-I-I.... Sorry...

If you want to join our self-defense force... Your contribution to world peace... Is mainly helping with natural disasters... We will not let you go to the battlefield. It's just... We need to remind everyone in advance... Some situations will test your conscience as a Japanese person... Don't look! Just close the window! -Call the ambulance! -Close the window! Close the window! Oh yeah....go for it... Alright... Today is Sunday. You're doing something good huh? Who are you? Huh? I'm Shinji. Are you a pervert mister? What are you saying? Why are you here?

Don't mind me. Please....show me. Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I know this is good for the body but... This shit is bland... Go buy some salad dressing. O-O-Oil free? That's right! Oil-free. There's a lot of famous matches in here. Watch them all! You need to train your mind in nutrition as well. Books are no good for me. I'd rather read manga. Manga! I can understand nutrition in manga format. Hey...if you want to get professional qualifications... It's not just sparring. There's a written test too. A professional can't be stupid. I'm not stupid! A pro? You wanna be one right? Right? I'll tell you something important... Before your first match... Masturbation and sex is prohibited. You're conditioning your body. There's no time limit. It will affect your legs and make your actions slower. Sounds good? For real? I mean, you wanna be a professional right? It's all forbidden! On that note...I'm going to a cabaret club. Hey...hey you single eyed bitch! Don't bullshit us! This is the worst... Thank you. Yes? This is the Miyamoto Peace nursing home. Kubota-san? Good work. The president came back. I'll transfer you to him. President, it's Kubota-san from Kubota Bed. Ah...hello? Oh, Kubota-san. Hello. I was just thinking about calling you. The payment? Could you please wait another 3 days? The side effects of the medicine is too strong. Yeah, yeah. No, no...you are right Kubota-san. I'm really sorry about this. Because of the that bill... There will be an increase in cheap labor and facilities. I can see that the income will decrease by next year. Please. It won't be 3 days. I'll send the money tomorrow. Yes! Please do so. Pardon me. If it's half a piece, it won't get my dick hard. Shouldn't you let your wife service you? Don't bully me. Didn't I get hard the other day? Was that an erection? Yo! You're looking beautiful today. Here! Here it is! Thanks! Red snake belly drink I have two new students. Both of them want to be professionals and they have potential. Is that so? Could you hire an instructor? I want to train them seriously. One of them is working in your nursing home. Although this isn't appropriate... It's not like you're paying him a lot of money anyways. Can you use the money you're giving him for an instructor? Horiguchi.. Yes? Use your body more. No matter what the business is... In Shinjuku there are people without legs who still get food. That's true. You're looking beautiful today. It's not a parent but a little son. It's not a turtle but the turtle head. It's not a big goose but a turtle head. It's not kids but ejaculation. A dick is very mysterious. So stupid! This song... An old man with dementia called Kumashiro-san sings this sometimes. The songs of the Showa era are so weird right? Can you sing big bro? Do you know any songs? I see...sorry, you can't sing huh? I really want to see you, I really want to see you. It's a sleepless night. I think of your kindness.... I'm reminded of your kindness. I try and close my eyes. And I whisper "I love you" That's amazing! Big bro! You're amazing! Really amazing! Amazing...amazing! M-m-my m-m-mother...was K-k-korean.... S-s-she was a h-h-hostess in Kabucho... My mom... P-p-passed a-a-away in Korea... W-when I was t-t-ten...my Dad brought me to J-j-japan... I-I've been l-l-living here ever since... My mom abandoned me. I don't know why either! Isn't there a place called the New National Stadium? There are residental areas over there. My Dad died there. He hung himself. I don't know why though. Sawamura Hisamitsu That's my Dad. What the hell is that? I don't know the reason why. The one who died, was Komaki my best friend. At that time... I was wondering why I didn't try and save him. Makoto... Don't blame yourself for this. There's a lot of people who died this year. A lot of them committed suicide. It's a meaningless sacrifice. My little brother is dead too. The feeling of wanting to die is pretty common after all. Keiko-chan..why did your best friend... Those of us who are hurting need to stop the suicide issue in this country. In order to do that...we need to make sure that this anti-suicide festival is a success. The economic system of recruitment! ※注：People who are poor have no other option than to join the self-defense force. Why don't we try out and see what happens? Let's try and find someone who wants to commit suicide. We'll collect their voices and spread our message around the world. What is that? It's the memento of my little brother who committed suicide. I would record things on it and show my brother. Right now we're in Shinjuku. Suicide? Yes. You're talking about wanting to die? Excuse us for filming you. Have you ever thought about suicide? Yesterday my motorcycle broke and I felt like dying. Yeah, I don't think about that. You don't? Can you take this? Thank you... One of my classmates commited suicide. There's money problems and not telling their family things. Have you thought about suicide? I have. I don't think I can do it. Do you take exams all the time? Yes. For seven years. I have thought about it a little bit. But I don't know why I wanna die though. I get worn out being a nurse. I'm always nursing people. If I'm being honest...yeah... I always want to die. Death? You're talking about dying? How about this? That's not it...we want to stop it. What? You want to stop it? Electricity? Yeah. Touto Electricity. Okay.. I'm a customer service specialist in Fukushima. We're a big name. From the 3/11 accident. ※注：The Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011 It's no excuse for there to be so many idiots all over Japan. They're dumb. Dumb! Fucking dumb! I wanna die. If I die then people are going to look after me. There are people everywhere worrying about death huh? You can't do that! This is how it's like huh? I misunderstood you. I'm sorry. What are you doing? I'm talking. With who? With my grave. Can you help me buy some real gasoline? Where's your family mister? I have a son. I haven't seen my family for half a year. Since you didn't become a second class officer in the self defense force...it must be pretty hard to get promoted. I resigned before retirement. And then you became homeless. I don't need a house. I'm gonna take a piss. I want to do something so he can recover. I have a plan. Why don't we prepare a place for him to live? We can let him recover then have a nice long talk with him. That sounds like a good plan! Keiko...do you know of a good place? I'll look into it. Thanks. Alright! Please go to the infirmary No. 1. 67.7kg Please go to the infirmary. Thanks! Go ahead!

He knocked him down in one hit! You did well. Oh, that's right. What about your ring name? What should I pick? What about you big bro? Actually, I've already been thinking about it. Wanna hear it? Shinjiku Shinji! Why? You were born in Shinjiku, Shinjiku Shinji. It's catchy isn't it? Sounds good. That sounds good. It's not bad. What do you think Shinji? Isn't that too simple? Well, whatever.

Barikan Kenji and Shinjuku Shinji. It's good isn't it? It's good! I wasn't sure about the barber clippers one. I thought about Edward scissors hand or Shaggy. I was really hesitant but... Barikan is the best name for this guy! It's like he's gonna say "I'm gonna cut up your hair!" Amazing...that's amazing. But Shinjuku Shinji is amazing too. Adding Shinjuku to your name is amazing. It's really impressive. It's impressive huh? Everyone knows what Shinjuku is! It's not Shibuya or Ikebukuro. It's Shinjuku! Why does it have to be Shinjuku? Nakama Shinji is no good! Shinjuku is.. It's a big name! (It's gonna sell!) It's big! Barikan Kenji is even bigger! Horiguchi always goes out at night doesn't he? I heard that he's a host. During the day he's a janitor. And at night he's a host wearing all black. He's gonna use that money to hire an instructor. He's doing it for us. Yes? This is Koshuya. Yes, that's right. It's going to be over in 9 minutes. Sorry! Don't get so angry! You're as cold and indifferent as Frosty the snowman! You took what's mine didn't you? Didn't you do it 7 times? If you go to a shop they add the total after 6 times right? What are you saying? I was making love to you. Didn't you like the love we made? Are you sure? I feel that way with everyone. Then wanna go on a date? Weren't you mad? I'am mad! So go on a date with me! I don't want to sell myself. Hey you! Open some good champagne! Yukiko-san. Thanks for the champagne. What are you going to eat? I already told you. You didn't.

Two pickled bamboo shoots please! Open up some good champagne! What's wrong? Hold on....hold on! Hold on! Where's the bathroom? Over there! Over there! The other way! The other way! When I was in an all-girls school... One of my friends who had a rough life said she wanted to die. Every time I saw this friend, she was always telling me how she was going to kill herself. She only talked about that. Then one day... I got a phone call from her and she told me she was going to commit suicide in the ocean. I didn't go looking for her... I thought she was lying... Don't blame yourself. I'm going home. Be safe out there. Keiko. Do you know what the most beautiful way to die is? It's not bad. It's pretty decent. Hey. Where is the cyclops? Who the hell are you? Don't talk about people with physical disabilities like that! Hey... The cyclops. Hey! Where is he? You little shit... Who the hell are you!? Hey! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! What are you doing? Yo!

Move! Come! Jab! Jab! Jab! Why are you scared!? Come on! Jab! Hit me! Take a good look and hit me! Don't hide! I really can't stand this vulgar person... Don't complain. He's really competent. More importantly... Both of your debuts have been set. For real? Big bro! Are debuts are set! I'm going home. Good work. Hello, good afternoon. Vegetables have gotten more pricey recently... That's right. See ya! Yes, thank you! Thank you Grandma. Welcome! Where is T-t-t-takeshi-san? Onii-chan! You have a guest! Alright, alright! Hello! May I ask who you are sir? Wait...are you....

He wants to box you Onii-chan! T-t-that's not it.... I can't do dirty things in front of these two. Please go home. Obachan! Bring the water Mari! That's right! Hold this Mari. Okay! Go home! It's not easy to box huh? Can you win? In boxing, the person who hates the opponent more is going to win. I've already started to hate this person. How can you hate a stranger? You've never seen him before. Nope... The hate...the hate... I'll slaughter him! Thanks for the food. I'm wet. I'm not wearing panties today. Welcome! Okay! I'll have the fried pork liver with garlic chives. I'll have the green onion pork ramen. Okay! I'm going Yoshiko-chan. I heard that you got a boxing license. You have a long history with Yuiji. Boxing isn't a fight alright? Don't underestimate pros. In the boxing world... The one with the most hate... Will become the champion. That's why... Hatred... Hatred... Hatred... Hatred... Big bro. Come over here. Try and hit me. You're looking properly aren't you? Look! I'm open right here! That's right! When someone hits you, then there is an opening in their body.

I'm okay! Sorry...sorry... Don't worry about it! I can't lose it.... I will put in the toilet paper right away. My best friend committed suicide. I didn't know that he wanted to kill himself. Why do you want to die mister? If I had to tell you... My body is becoming unable to support my lively spirit. This is your new friend, Fukushima-san. Hey.. If you want to leave then feel free to tell us. Is this a place for killing people? This is a place meant for living. I'm Fukushima from Touto Electricity. This place is good.... I don't care about my blood pressure and I'm free to live here. I can also drink sake too. It's a wonderful paradise. When did you come here? Shut your mouth! Okay. I apologize. I'm really sorry about that. Lock the door. It's not easy seeing people kill each other. Whether it's a drone or a suicide terrorist attack. People won't face each other. That's why they can do it. My little brother was obsessed with death. He created a device to kill himself with after all. You program yourself in by face recognition. In other words... Are you able to kill yourself if you see your own face? When I do this, I can forget about everything. Is it true that your little brother is still alive? My underclassmen told me that your brother is in my high school. It's probably a misunderstanding. I'm very active and busy. This stage is going to be completed by everyone. Anti-suicide festival Come over here. Hold out your hands. Everyone gets nervous and wants to run away during their debut. There's nobody here. Is thing gonna work? There is no gain in boxing.

That's why you want to commit suicide? Why did the returning team members commit suicide? What are you trying to say? I just want to get to know you. I'll be looking forward to it. You're going to be helping me with the anti-suicide festival after all. Why are you here? I didn't want to go back home. I'm glad. I heard that you are popular with the elderly women. But... You have to take good care of your body in order to do a good job. Alright, I'll be leaving first. Dodge! Dodge! Faster! You're slow! Too slow! You tortoise dipshit! Faster! Dodge! Dodge! Dodge! Dodge! Dodge! Alright! Jab! Why are you closing your eyes? If you close your eyes then you're just gonna get hit! You're an easy target! I told you not to close your eyes! Do you understand? Huh?

Boxing is the only thing I want to do properly. Is that so? I won't do anything bad anymore... I won't do illegal things anymore. That's why...you need to as well. I'm working diligently at the ramen shop aren't I? If you don't have a place then you'll continue to fall. After I was robbed by you, I was super pissed off. But after I met you again, I wasn't so pissed off anymore. After I thought about what kind of lifestyle you lived, I became super sad. I don't want to be distant from you! Right? Where is your hometown? Shut up! It took courage for me to say this! I'm not as good as you think I am. That's not true! What do you understand? Don't think that we're the same.

Horiguchi. Everyday is so interesting. Thank you for giving me this job. Please stop that. We will have good results. Welcome back. Good evening. Horiguchi-san. This is our newcomer Setsu-san. Thanks. She's a disaster victim. She lost her daughter in the incident... And then she came to Shinjuku and found me. You made your debut didn't you? Will I be forgiven if I kill you in the ring? I saw Yuki-san. Yuki-san told me to forget about the past. He forgave me. I don't care! What have you done? I don't understand you Shinji! I gave it my all! Whether it was remitting money, swindling, or collecting debt.... I let old people fall into misfortune.... I was violent with people who I never met.... I earned more money than anyone else! But even then... You and Yuki-san never acknowledged me. I despised you guys. Yuki-san is strong! Even though I did something like.... I don't give a shit! You're a piece of shit! This has nothing to do with Yuki! This is a problem between you and me! I understand. Tonight is sponsored by the Northwest University Suicide Research Society. Thank you for participating in the anti-suicide festival. Now the event shall begin! Hello everyone. I'm the representative of this association, Omote Kawasaki. These four men and women.... Each have their own reasons for wanting to commit suicide. I used to think that suicide prevention is understanding people's inner feelings. However, I haven't been able to grasp the essence of suicide until now. So, I want to think about death from a different angle. That means understanding the physiological moment before ending your own life. Today in this place... Let's fulfill their desire to commit suicide. What are they feeling at that time? What kind of expression will we see? Just pull down the rope of the first one and you will find out. This is to everyone who wants to commit suicide.... You can finally say goodbye to this world. Say farewell with a meaningless suicide. Your suicide will leave an imprint on the audience's hearts. Isn't that wonderful? This is Hashimoto-san who fails his exams. How do you feel? The formula for the equation is... Is that all you want to say? I'm a virgin! I'm a virgin.... I can't do this... This is Kawakami-san a housewife. You can finally be freed from the painful nurse life. I'm sorry.... Didn't you say that you wanted to die? I didn't hear about this.... I should decide whether I want to die or not. This will become an assisted suicide... This is murder! Somebody please call the police! Didn't you tell us countless times that you were going to die in Shinjuku center? I didn't say it! I didn't say it! I don't wanna die! I'm against this! Save me! Everyone! This is the president of the Touto Electricity customer service. It's the company that caused the Nuclear power leak accident. He dealt with thousands of complaints from people. I'm very sorry about that accident! I did it! The nuclear leakage accidents were all my fault! I did it! I caused the Fukushima nuclear leak! I'm sorry! You guys! You made me confess everything! What the hell is up with you guys!? Why are you guys just standing there looking dumb! I almost died! You weren't going to stop me!? You guys are just standing there...you gotta be shitting me! The nuclear leakage is something intense! You guys are fucking lifeless! Just die! Just disappear! I hate all of you with a passion! Disappear! Let me introduce you to the last person. This is Niki Takeo-san! He is a former second class self-defense officer. He was equivalent to a lieutenant. He used to send troops overseas to risk their lives. He led 20 squad members. But after he came back home.... 4 of his subordinates committed suicide. He also wants to die as well. Now the public thinks what you say and do is bad... They also said you received orders for corporal punishment... They blamed the suicides on you. But in reality... You don't have any responsibility for this. Their fate is death after all. They are people that died silently like ants. We saved women and children in the desert. People who died in the line of duty as heroes... And my 4 subordinates who committed suicide... Whose life do you think is more important? The correct answer is that life is indifferent. It doesn't matter whether it's on the battlefield or not. A person's comrades died. That is all. Do you understand, kids? Well said! That's not it. The weak are forced into a place where there is no way out... The only way you can compete with the strong and beautiful.... Is to kill yourself. Just like your subordinates.... A meaningless death is unacceptable! They need a more thought provoking death! What are you saying? Are you crazy in the head or something? Go away! Why don't you guys understand!? How can people die meaningless deaths!? This is way too damn dark! Go home! You guys are sick! Sick! Go home! Go home! Go home! The most serious disease in humans... The disease called hope... Even then, the only thing I can do is survive. This is a shitty world. I'll show you guys.... A beautiful death. What are you saying? Hurry up and go home! We have a news report in the middle of the show. At 7:10 pm... In Northwestern University in Shinjuku, Tokyo... The sponsor of the anti-suicide festival... Committed public suicide through drones. He is dead. The suicide was broadcasted live over the network. There are currently more than 10,000 witnesses. It seems like the motive of this program is to protest again the Social Contribution law. Shinji! Go for it! Go for it Shinji! Go for it! Go for it! Hit him with the 1212 and beat him! What are you doing? Just like that! Go, go, go! Turn clockwise! Hey, hey! Go, go, go! He's not fast, beat him! Beautiful! Go right! Keep it together Shinji! Calm down! Calm down! Don't be taken down! Use your head! It seems like he's not going to be able to finish this round... Go! Go! Go! Do it now! What are you doing numb nuts? Stop! Alright! You hit him good! What are you doing? You're not going all out. Are you just messing around? I'm not good enough to do that. Don't look at me like that big bro! Stupid! Be serious! I'll tell you something good. Look on the right side of the auditorium. I'll show him how I'm gonna kill him in the next round. I'll be looking forward to it. Round two start! Go for it Shinji! Down! Alright Shinji! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Box! Go for it! Go for it! Go! Go! What is that idiot doing? Is that guy going to fight left-handed? He's never done it before! Idiot! Go for it Shinji! He's a good son. Go for it! Go for it! Go! Go! Go! Idiot! Alright! Stop! Stop! Stop! Shinji! Stop it! Alright Shinji! You won! You already won! Alright! Let me go! Let me go! The winner is Shinjuku Shinji! Yuji! Hey Yuji! Hey Yuji! Look me in the eyes! I will kill you next time Yuji! I'm going to slaughter you! I'll kill you! Wait for me! I'll show you a good death! Yuji! Yuji! I'll kill you! Before I shed my tears I pretend to be asleep Tonight just like this... I'm going to sleep until the morning. I can't move when I'm crouched down. I reluctantly give you an answer The inside of my memory becomes broken. Let's go home and hug. Time will allow us to forgive someday. Let's not hurry and break it. I have a treasure chest hidden Let's go to that town. I want you to be closer next time. You pretended to smile. We can do it just like that. I want you to actually smile. Before our time ends someday. I'll never let go of your hand. I lost my treasure chest. Let's go to that town. Puff up your chest and look up. If you can walk over here If I didn't meet you... Someone told me quietly... Just like time changes things.... There isn't a tomorrow here. Now the inside of the treasure chest... Is completely empty on the inside! I don't want tonight to end! I don't want tonight to end! Before I shed my tears I pretend to be asleep. Tonight just like this... I'll sleep until the morning. Let's sleep until dawn.
