Bombers high Riding the air Every man Doing his share Men of war Better beware When the Air Force Takes command Bombers high Ready we stand Minutemen Guarding the land Thunder rides Here in our hand When the air force Takes command Our legions Are legend Our wings Own the blue With jets Winding free And men Flying true Ride the wind Follow a star Find the foe Strike where they are Round the world Isn't too far When the air force Takes command America today is watching her skies with grave concern. For in these skies of peace, the nation is building its defense. To the officers and men of The United States Air Force, to The Strategic Air Command, whose cooperation is gratefully acknowledged, and to the young men of America who will one day take their places besides them, this motion picture is dedicated. Well, here we are. An Elderly Parson, shouldn't yield to temptation this way. Oh, nonsense, Dad. The sun will do you good. Good morning. Hi, darling! Hey, that boy's good. Who is he? He's a rookie named Brewster. Just up from Columbus. Hi, Joe. How am I doing, coach? Well, you're comming along. Coming along, huh? This daughter of yours is kind of hard to please, you know? Say, how about that Brewster kid? Doesn't he look sharp? No. They ougth to play him at third. He doesn't move well to the right. You want him to take my job. Oh!, in 3 or 4 years, perhaps. He's young. He can wait. Yeah, true. What's going on now, Robert? Intersquad game. Reds against the blues. I'm captain of the blues. See you later. Oh, that reminds me. I forgot to give Dutch a message. Some Air Force friend of his named Rusty Castle phoned and said he was comming over. Oh, well, Dutch won't care much one way or the other. How do you know he won't? Well, I just know. He's and old war buddy of his, a flyer or something, and I know Dutch. The last thing he wants is to hass over old times. You seem to know you husband very well considering the short time you've been married. Oh, I do! I know him like a book. - Is that so surprising? - Well, rather. Why? I've known your mother for 30 years. What I don't know about her would fill a very large book. Now, I'm just going to show you. Brewster is comming to bat, and Dutch likes him. And the kid always hits to the left. Now, you just watch Dutch. If he connects, he's going to try to make it look like a hit. See what I mean? Any more questions, Dr. Thorne? Well, I guess we better go, Dad. Good morning, reverend, Sally. Hi, Tom. Well, our boy looks pretty good. Yes, he's coming along. Can't you stay a while? No, thank you. Dad has to work on his sermon, and I have to go home and get ready for the housewarming. You just stay here and watch your livestock at work. and pretty expensive livestock... especially your husband. Yes, well, feeding him is no cinch, either, you know. I'll see you later. Tom. Bye-bye. - Mrs. Holland? - Yes. I'm Rusty Castle. Oh, yes, of course! This is my father Dr. Thorne and Mr. Doyle. Hello, Mr. Doyle. Well, I'm glad to meet you, General. - General? - Rusty! Rusty, how are you? Hello, Dutch. Boy, am I glad to see you. Hey, you're looking great. How are you hitting them? Oh, I'm getting in shape. - Did you meet all these people? - Yeah. Why didn't you tell us you were coming to town? Well, see. I was over at a staff meeting at MacDill... Oh, General Castle did phone. I haven't had a chance to tell you. I'm sorry. Oh! Oh, well, that's all right! When, you just got here at the right time. We're having a houseworming tonight. How about staying over, huh? Well, I... - Oh, please do! - Along, come on! I'd be glad to. Good. Well, I've got to run, sweetheart, and I'll see you later. I'm awfully glad you can stay, General. Thanks, Mrs. Holland. Goodbye, reverend. Well, what do you know? What's new, Rusty? Well, come on, give me the lowdown. That's just what I came to do, Dutch. But I think it better wait until later. Oh? What, is something cooking? Yeah, in a way. Is that so? Hey, Dutch, you're up! Oh!, I'll see you later. Dutch is pretty valuable to the Cardinals, Isn't he, Mr. Doyle? Valuable? He drove in 152 runs last year. He just signed a $70.000 a year contract. We don't pay salaries like that for fun, General. Yes, I can understand that. Dutch was the best B-29 commander I had. Not many men with his judgment, coordination, and whatever else it takes to come through in the pinches. Why did you ask me that, General? Why? I was thinking... He'd be just as valuable to S.A.C. S.A.C? What's S.A.C.? Strategic Air Command. We're the Air Forces's Global bombing outfit. Oh. You're the boys that dropped the A-Bomb? Well, I hope not. Our job is to be ready and able to strike back anywhere in the world if this country is ever attacked. And quite a job you got there, General. Yes, It's a big job, all right. Our greatest problem is personnel, Mr. Doyle. We need mature, experienced leaders in S.A.C. Men like Dutch. Are you trying to tell me they want Dutch back in the Air Force? That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you, Mr Doyle. Oh, boy! Well, this is the craziest thing I've ever heard of. What do you want with a guy me age? I haven't flown and airplane in 6 years. I've never even been close to a jet. Look, Dutch, we don't need young kids in S.A.C. We need old hands like you, experience. Well, where's the fire? I, I, I just don't see the necessity. You would if you were in my seat. Look, do you realize that we're the only thing that's keeping the peace? By staying combat ready, we can prevent a war. Dutch, if I didn't beleave that, If my commanders and crew didn't believe that, I couldn't get a single airplane off the ground. But I I've don't my share. Doggone it, why do you have to recall me? I'm not recalling you, Dutch. This wasn't my decision. Believe me, I fell worse about it than you do. I asked you to take that reserve commission just as a gesture for old time's sake. I never thought the time would come. All right, whose decision was this? General Hawkes. I even tried to talk him out of it, but they're calling up everyone in your reserve classification. The General was adamant... no exceptions. I could talk to? Sure, sure, but he's boss of S.A.C. There are people who could fire him, but I'll guarantee there's no one Who could ever make him change his decision. Well, this is it, then, huh? I report a week from tuesday? That's right. Your orders are on their way now... 21 months of active duty. 21 months? You, you realize what this does to me? I'm no youngster anymore. I've got a few more good years in baseball left. No you take me away... Look, Dutch, there's just no point in arguing with me. No, I guess not. Your orders read report to my headquarters at Carswell. Yes, sir. Well, I... I guess I'd better be running along, Dutch. See you soon, huh? Yes, General, I suppose you will. Leaving, General? Oh, yes!, I'm afraid I have to, Mr. Doyle. Would you please give my apologies to Mrs. Holland? Well? Well, that's it... 21 months. I have to report to Carswell a week from tuesday. Isn't there anyone we can go to? Castle says it's no use. Of course, you know how I feel, Dutch. Yeah, yeah. What worries me most is Sally, though. Sally? Oh! I wouldn't worry too much about her. No, but I do. This is going to be an awfull wallop to her. She's been fixing up the house. She's getting a big kick out of the ball club. Now something like this happens. What am I going to tell her? Maybe it won't be as hard as you think. Well, just don't say anything to her about it, will you? She's worked so hard on this housewarming and everything. I just want her to have this evening, huh? I won't say a word. I'll figure out some way to break it to her later when everybody's letf. Come on! It was a lovely party, Sally. and you look just radiant. Thank you. It's wonderful to see a young couple so gay and happy, isn't it? it certainly is, Mrs. Thorne. Good night, Tom. Good night, Sally. Good night, Tom. I'll see you. Well... It was just a wonderful party, Sally. Thank you, sweetheart. You know, we're going to remenber this for a long time our first housewarming. That's the kind of thing you don't forget, you know. No. That's why I wanted it to be just perfect. It sure was. Your mother seemed to have a good time, didn't she? Yes. She always does. She's beginning to sound more like a baseball fan every day. Say, your dad had a drink just to celebrate the occasion. I know. I saw him. Sally, would you... let me have this a minute. I... come over here and sit down. - Dutch. - Sally. What? There's something I have to tell you. Well, what is it? You're going back into the Air Force. Tom told me this afternoon. Well, that's what I've been trying to. Well, what do you think? Well, what do I think? what do you think? I don't care about this house. Mother can take care of that. We can sublet. That's no problem. I certainly don't mind missing the season and losing all that money. What? No. I'm not a child. Oh, honey, I know you're not a child. And if you go, then we both go on active duty. Besides, what's wrong with being an Air Force wife and living in a barracks or whatever you call them? It migh be fun. Anything you do is fine with me, just so long as you don't leave me behind. You mean that? Of course I do. I married you, Dutch, not a house room. I'm lieutenant colonel Holland. I'm reporting in for duty. May I see your identification, colonel? I, I don't have an I.D. card. They never sent me one. I'm sorry, sir. I can't admit a civilian without identification. I'm not a civilian! I wish I was a civilian. Here. Here are my orders. Civilian. Security officer? Captain, I've got a man here at the gate with no identification card. His orders say that he's on active duty, but he's not in uniform. Very well, sir. You'll have to wait, sir, until the security officer gets here. Sergeant, if you'd just call General Castle... Hey. Pull over. Pull over there, then. General Castle, please. May I speak to the General? This is Dutch Holland... Colonel Holland. Well, as soon as you reach him, would you tell him, I'm having a little trouble at the main gate? That's right. I can't get in. May I see your orders? Oh, this whole thing's ridiculous. and your driver's license. There you are. License expired. It has? Are you Dutch Holland the ball player? I was. I've been reading about you. You don't look much like your pictures. Well, you don't look much like your picture, either, Captain. We had a phony one time. Fella got on the base With a pass that showed a picture of an orangutan. They had us all on the carpet for that one. No orangutans allowed? I'm glad to see your men are on the job, Captain. That's be all. Hello, Dutch, how are you? I'm sorry you had so much trouble here, but a uniform would help, you know. Yeah, well, I left in such a hurry, and muy old ones were the wrong color. Yeah, well, that'll be easy. I'll drop you off at the post exchage, first stop. OK. Did Sally come with you? No, She'll be here as soon as I get squared away. Good. I can get you a set of quarters here on the base. Fine. "Control tower calling General Castle". Castle. Go ahead. Sir, I've got a commercial DC-3 coming in for an emergency landing. Why can't he land at municipal airport? He says he can't make it, sir. All right, have the security officer notified right away. Affirmative, General. Notify the security officer. We're kind of particular these days, Dutch. All S.A.C. bases are restricted. Alert the fire trucks and meet wagon. Fire station, we have an unidentified DC-3 in the pattern, landing at the present time. That is all the information we have. This is Colonel Holland. I'll vouch for him. Where does that fool think he's going? All right, stand back. Major, search that airplane. Yes, sir. That won't be necessary. What's the excuse, Rusty? Well, Frankly, sir, I thought we handled this security test pretty well. Better than I expected. Of course, you just lost your life, Rusty. Why didn't you block off that taxi strip, Major? It never ocurred to me, General Hawkes. It should have. Your men should have gotten here sooner. My men should never have gotten out of that aircraft. Yes, sir. I don't have enough experienced personnel, sir. Don't tell me your little problems, son. All I'm interested in is results. I want airtight security, Rusty, so it'll be impossible for an unidentified aircraft to barge right into your flight line. What the devil is that civilian doing here? I'm just carrying out your orders, General. My orders? Yes, sir. He was with me, General, just reporting for duty. Lieutenant Colonel Holland, this is General Hawkes. You're Dutch Holland? Yes, sir. We've been expecting you. Yes, sir, I know. In a blue suit. General, I realize... Good to have you in S.A.C., Dutch. Hope you enjoy your tour. You'll find there's been a few changes since you were in last. Yes, sir, I've found a few already, General. Come in. Colonel Holland, sir, reporting for duty. Glad to have you assigned to my wing, Dutch. Got a real job waiting for you in operations, unless you have a preference. Well, sir, as long as I'm here I'd just as soon fly as sit at a desk. You'll fly, all right All my staff officers are pilots first and desk jockeys second. "Samford". Come in, will you, Rocky? Rocky Samford is my director of operations. You'll be his assistant. Sounds fine to me, Colonel. Of course, I'm an old B-29 pilot. I don't know the first thing about a B-36. Well, we'll check you out on a B-36 while you understudy Samford. The idea is for you to replace him, so he can move into one of the new units. I see. S.A.C. has something big coming up... the B-47. Colonel Samford. Colonel Holland. How are you? Glad to meet you, Dutch. Been a fan of yours for years. I heard about you back on Guam when you where with the 315th. Well, Rocky, he's your baby. You've got yourself an assistant. Shouldn't take you long to take over my job, Dutch. No sweat. I've got 21 months. I'll do what I can. Good luck on your physical. Thank you, sir. Want to take a look at our setup? Fine. "P-E-Z." "T-E-C-F-D... E- D-F... " Captain Brown. "C-Z-P." Call for you, Colonel Holland. Colonel Holland. Sally. Well, how are you? Where are you? I'm at the airport. What airport? Here in Fort Worth? What are you doing here? Well, what do you think I'm doing? I came to be with you Oh!, I've missed you. I'm your bride of 5 months, remember me? Yes, dear, I know, but... Well, I just didn't see any sense in sitting around and waiting, so here I am. Don't you want me? Well, honey, of course I want you, but we don't have any quarters yet. Now, I have to get in touch with Rusty and find out. I'll tell you. You go to a hotel. Go to the Blackstone hotel, and I'm taking a physical examination right now. What's the matter? Are you sick? No, no, everything's fine. As soon as... I'll call you later. Bye, dear. Good bye. Where was I? Say "A". Captain Johnson. It's for you, Colonel. Colonel Holland. You're at the main gate? Well, yeah, I got ahold of Rusty, and he's checking on it now, but I... get somebody to take you over to the officers club. I'll come over as soon as I'm finished. I have no idea, dear. They go over you from head to foot. They're just down to my throat now. What? Well, this one says I don't have any adenoids. Adenoids. Good bye, dear. We're going to take you up to 45.000 feet. Major Fleming. Colonel Holland can't come to the phone right now. Just a minute. It's your wife, Colonel Holland. She says it's urgent. Well, uh... Tell her I'll call her back. He says he'll call you back. He's up to 45.000 feet. I don't see him. No, no, in a training tank, Mrs. Holland. Mrs. Holland is at your quarters. She says to meet her there. My quarters? Where are they? She says General Castle drove her to your quarters. She has no idea where they are. Do all Air Force officers live in such luxury? Oh, no, this is just because General Hawkes has taken such a shine to me. Yeah, well, he certainly has, the old bat. Now, shh, shh. Sally, now, we're on a S.A.C. base. Dutch, are you angry with me because I didn't wait for you to send for me? Well, I was kind of upset at first, but now that I see you in that nightgown, I've kind of changed my mind. It's all right. All right, dear. All right. - Hi. - Hi. - Hello, Mrs. Castle. What's happened? The cards are ahead 6 to 2. Do you know that Brewster just drove in another run? Eh, good for him! Well, I guess I'd better get out there. You wait for me, honey. I won't be long. Are you sure? Yeah. Rocky's going to show me one takeoff and one landing. That's all. OK. - Bye. - Bye. - Hi, Dutch. - Hi, Rocky. - We're about set. - Fine. I'm going to ride copilot today. Check the crew's proficiency. You can ride behind the aircraft commander, see how it's done. OK. This is a select combat crew, incidentally... all sharp tools. Hey! Colonel Holland! Sergeant Bible, how are you? Good. gee, it's good to see you. I thought the cardinals had you all signed up, Skipper. Yeah, I thought so, too, but General Hawkes has a prior claim, and he wouldn't give me a waiver. Well, it's looks like we're taking up were we left off. well, I hope not. We had 2 engines shot out the last one over Tokyo, remember? Oh, boy, that was quite a night, wasn't it? I thought you were going to get out on the Air Force. No, I'm still in. Still in the same racket flight engineer. Got married a while back. Fine. Any kids? Sure have, one on the ramp, one in the hangar. Ha! Good for you. Good for you. Say, now, what about this? Don't tell me you've rigged up this great big thing so it'll fly. Well, if it doesn't, it'll be my neck. Preflight completed, sir. OK. I'll give you your safety procedures in a minute, sir. All right. Checklist completed. Ready to start engine, sir. "Roger, crew, this is A.C." "Brakes are set, fire guards are standing by." "Start engine." Roger in aft compartment. "Uh, ground, this is panel." "This is ground." "Clear 4-5-6-3-2-1 for start." "4 is clear, sir." "Roger. Starting 4." "Roger." "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6." Fuel pressure, oil pressure, and alternator on board. Clear 5. "Number 5 clear." Turning 5. "Roger." Start jets 1, 2, 3, and 4. Starting jets. Entrance ladders. Stowed. Windows and hatches. Closed. All compartments. Nose ready for takeoff. Radio ready for takeoff. Aft compartment ready for takeoff. Engineers, takeoff configuration. Standing by for propeller reverse safety check and takeoff power. Aircraft commander to crew... standby for takeoff. Engineer, give me takeoff power. Jets 100% Power stabilized. - Autopilot. - Off. - Nose steering. - On. - Propellers. - Safe. Light's out. Checklist complete. Rolling. Hey, aren't you fellas a little high for a landing pattern? We're right on flight plan, Dutch. How high you going? 40.000 feet, Colonel. 40.000 feet? Oh, I see! One takeoff, one landing? Where's the landing going to be, Rocky, Fairbanks, Alaska? Right where we told you. Back at Carswell. Oh, I see! Profile mission, huh? Texas to Alaska and back? You know, when I was a kid, somebody sold me the key to the pitcher's box. Looks like I just bought it again. You sure did, Dutch. Now, you know who's Really gonna appreciate this? My wife Sally. I asked her to wait for me. Don't worry, Dutch. Espy's gonna tell her. Colonel, you wanna see the rest of this big cigar? Yeah, yeah. Take over, onionhead. This is Colonel Dutch Holland. Captain Miller. Hi, Captain. Sergeant Jones. Mighty glad to meet you, Colonel. Wait till my kids hear about this. We saw in the papers you were coming. You and I are goin' in opposite directions, you might say. This is my last flight. Oh, you gettin' out? Yes, sir. My hitch is up. No more of this high pressure stuff for me. Fella likes to get home once in a while and see his wife and kids. Kind of rough duty in S.A.C, huh? Oh!, no, sir, I wouldn't say that, not if you like being away from home all the time, temporary duty in England, North Africa, Japan, maintenance of weekends, working all night. Oh, great! just not for me, that's all. - You wanna follow me, Colonel? - Were we goin' now? We're goin' through the holland tunnel to the gunner's compartment. Left gunner from radio 2 men coming through. Well, I'll be darned. - I'll see you later Sergeant. - Yes, sir. - All right, Colonel. - OK. That's quite a trip. Yeah. It's about 80 feet. I never have gotten used to that thing. Fellas, this is Colonel Dutch Holland. Sergeant Lassiter. How are you? Let's see... Sergeant Dames. - Hello, Colonel. - Oh, how are you? Airmen lay. Hello, Colonel. It's not quite ready. We'll have a cup in a minute. All the comforts of home? Sure, sure. This is airman Davies. Hi, Colonel. Have a seat. Fine. Well, what do you think of her, sir? She's a battleship. Oh, what am I saying? I guess it seems a lot different from our old B-29. That's the same gunsight we had in the 29. Isn't it? Same type, different model. Of course, when you boil it all down, it's still an aircraft and a crew working together to get a bomb on a target. But there isn't a war on. Do many of the men feel like that radio operator? Every day in S.A.C.'s a war, Colonel. Pressure's on all the time, and General Hawkes is breathing down your neck. We never know when the other fella may start something, so we've gotta be combat ready 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. How do you find the guys that will take it at these pay scales? Well, it's the competition, maybe. You take a sellect crew like this, they've all got spot promotions. Our aircraft commander would be a Major instead of a light colonel If he weren't on this crew. If one man lets the crew down, The whole crew gets demoted. It keeps 'em in there pitchin' I can think of an easier way to make a buck. Well, the coffee's free, anyhow. Colonel Holland, This is Major Mapes, our radar observer. How are you? Hi, Colonel. Major Ike Knowland, our navigator. Hi, Major. You sure have my sympathy, Dutch. How do you mean, Knowland? I was yanked back in, too. Just when I got a nice tv business started. Built a house for the wife and kids. Well, you'll only be in for 21 months. What do you mean, "only"? You can't tell me they need radar navigators this bad. Anyway, I did my share once. We're not in a war. I think I know what you mean. Come on, Dutch. We'll put you to work. OK, she's yours. Course 3-3-0. I've got it. Where did those jets come from, Rocky? Our fighter escort. Part of S.A.C. - I'll take over. - OK. That's it. Let's go home. Airspeed 1-3-5. 1-3-0. 1-2-5. Arm 'em. Reverse. I'm terribly sorry, honey. I had no idea this thing. Oh, I know. Now you clim in, Marco Polo, before I sure you for desertation. Did you ever go over Niagara Falls in a barrel? Yes. That makes 2 of us. - Hi, Sally. - Hi. Hey, Dutch, not so fast. You're not through yet. Now what? Steam bath and massage in the physical conditionating room. Just a couple of hours more. Honey, you better go on home. This may take another couple of days. See you later. Sally? Well, here you are. The same night, too. You angry with me? No, darling. I'm just confused. Why? I don't know whether to fix you breakfast or dinner. Well, let's see... It's nearer breakfast. You hungry? Not very. I'm tired. Where did you boys go on your little jaunt, or is that a secret? Well, this was a local mission... Alaska. All right, you don't have to tell me. Honey, I just did tell you. We went to Alaska! Alaska and back without landing or anything? Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm certainly glad I didn't know that, or I wouldn't have slept at all. You don't look like you slept very much, either. Well, I did fly the airplane most of the night, with a lot of help, but that's not it. It's just being out of the picture for so long. Having so much to learn, so much to cath up on. Oh, sweetheart, you're just tired. You wouldn't believe the mess of new gadgets they have on that thing. The aircraft commander was a real pro. Even he say he's still learning things about the B-36. Well, why are you worrying about all of this? You said you had a desk job. I'm supposed to be an operations officer. And you can't tell an aircraft commander what to do unless you can do it yourself. In this outfit, everybody flies, from General Hawkes on down. In other words, then, you're going to fly a lot of missions like this one? I don't know any other way to do it. Well, that's a happy prospect. Especially if I find out too late. I'm in over my head. Maybe I better quit right now. Quit? Well, It's better than crossing things up in an emergency. Honey, you know, I used to think the old B-24 was a lot of airplane. Do you realize that one B-36 with an A-Bomb can do the job of 1.000 world war II bombers and 10.000 crew members? Now, just think of the responsability that places on everybody that even goes near one of these airplanes. I've never heard you talk like that before. I've never come up against anything like this before. Well, neither have I, for that matter. Being an Air Force wife certainly is not for me, but it isn't that simple. I could go in to Rusty tomorrow and lay it on the line, tell him I can't cut it. Oh, don't talk like that. Well, wouldn't you like that, Sally? Well, of course I would. I'd like nothing better, especially under the circumstances. What circumstances? Oh, that's what makes me so mad. What's the sense of talking about it when you know you're not gonna do any such thing, and you know it. How do you know I won't? Because I know you. You'd no more walk in there and tell Rusty you're gonna quit than... well, I was gonna say fly. I guess maybe you're right. You know me pretty well, don't you? Do I? Wish you'd put that in writing. Why? I'd like to send it to my father. Honey, you where gonna say something back here. No, I've said everything I have to say. Dutch. Yeah? How do you want your eggs, scrambled or fried? Uh... scrambled. No. Fried. Over... Easy. You know, I'm beginning to know you pretty well, too, young lady. You are? I learned a lot than night at the housewarming. You remenber when I had to break the news to you? That was a lovely house. It was a lovely party, too. Sally... Yes? I've got something to tell you. Now, it's pretty personal, but I think it's gonna make you very happy. What is it? You're going to have a baby. How dou you know? I met the Stork at 40.000 feet. Then I met doc Baxter, and he congratulated me, so that was the other. Well, what do you think? What do I think? I think it's wonderful. I hope it's twins. Oh, Dutch. Well, all I can say is we're mighty lucky it happened before you had to report for duty. Why? Well, judging from my short experience in the Air Force, it couldn't very well have happened after that. Will do, General. Well, you got what you wanted Dutch. Your own airplane and a crew... temporarily. Now you're talkin'. General Castle did the talking. But don't forget, you're still flying a desk for me primary duty. You sent for me, sir? Colonel espy has ordered me to reassing you, Knowland. Your aircraft commander has asked that you be replaced. Anything wrong with my qualifications for a select crew, sir? No. That's the unfortunate part of it. You're as well qualified as any radar navigator in this wing. He says it's your attitude. You haven't been putting out. Well, what do they expect my attitude to be? Gratitude for wrecking my business career? What about my request for transfer, sir? Or is the only way to get out of S.A.C. to be carried out? Don't hold your breath while you're waiting. We'll let you know. Meantime, you're not getting out of flying. You're being reassigned to a noncombat ready crew. You lost your spot promotion a couple of days ago. Hey, Ike. Wait a minute. Say, uh... They're giving me a pick-up crew to train with for a while. I'll need an experienced navigator. Not particular, huh? Maybe I am. We're both in a particular sort of situacion. Yeah. Same raw deal. Well, you migh say the same deal. How about it? It's ok by me. It's OK with me, until the first time you get me off course. 1-3-0. 1-2-5. 1-2-0. 1-1-5. Arm the props. Ike, you missed your ETA by 45 seconds. You owe me a buck. Ok, Dutch, But it's the first time you've won it in 6 months. Reverse. No more fuel leaks so far. Maybe the modification's all right, maybe not. The next series of tests will give us the answer. Has Dutch Holland been running these fuel tank tests? Yes, sir. I thought he had a staff job. You made him an aircraft commander? Well, I'd say he's doing both, sir. But he sure likes to fly. He does, eh? Going, Dutch? Now don't have the baby till I get back. I want to be here to greet him. I'll certainly try not to. You know, I kinda have a feeling the little fella's not going to report in for about 2 weeks. I'll be back in 4 days. Well, I certainly hope it's a little fella, for your sake. But you know, it could be a girl. A girl? Sure. I suppose it's a possibility. Sweetheart, do you have to go on this trip right now? Honey, I've been running these cold weather tests. I have to go through with them. Couldn't it be postponed, even just till after the baby gets here? Well, Sally, we've got a job to do. Now, if we start scheduling flights to fit the birthrate, do you realize there are 1.500 babies born a month in S.A.C.? And do you realize you're getting to sound more like General Hawkes every day? - I am? - Yes. I promise I won't smoke any big black cigars. That will be very nice. Right. Where are you going? Thule. Thule? - Where's that? - Greenland. Greenland? - Yeah. - In february? Well... With all that ice and snow? Well, we're running cold weather tests, you see, and in order to run a cold weather test... you have to have cold weather. - Yeah. - Yeah. What do you want me to bring you, a polar bear, penguin? How about a husband? Got one. No. I want a husband right here on the ground, not one that's 8 miles over Greenland or Alaska or Timbuktu. Whatever happened to that nive guy who played third base for the Cardinals? You mean Brewster? No. I mean you. Oh, I'm sorry. It's just so hard to be a good sport at 5 A.M., especially when you're 9 months pregnant. Now don't you worry. The little fella's never gonna know the diferrence. before he's a year old, I'll be back at third. I hope so. Good bye, dear. Take it a minute. Aw, we're never gonna get under this stuff, Leo. Call Thule approach control for G.C.A. Roger. Thule approach control from Air Force. I've just been out on the left wing, sir. We've got a bad leak in number 2 fuel tank, gas sloshing around near the fire walls. May have a fire any second. All right, cut off every electrical system you can spare. We're gonna be over the base in about 40 minutes. Aircraft commander to crew... we have a bad fuel leak in the left wing. Gasoline fumes. No smoking. Take stations for possible emergency bailout. Take bailout stations. Might be that sudden temperature change, Dutch. 42 below zero out there. Rear scanner to aircraft commander... we're on fire, Colonel. Number one engine. Feather 1, 2, and 3. Fuel switches off to 1, 2, and 3. Fire extinguishers on. All right, start jets 3 and 4. 100% Full power on 4, 5, and 6. A.C. to crew standby for inmediate bailout when you hear the long ring. A.C. to navigator call Thule tower. Give 'em our exact position. Keep giving it to 'em. Roger. Radio, this is navigator. Our position is 68 degrees, 45 minutes west longitude. 76 degrees, 10 minutes north latitude. I repeat. Hadn't we better belly land, Dutch? We'll freeze to deatch down there. I'm afraid we'd blow up first. Fire spreading over the whole wing Colonel. A.C. to crew... Bail out as close together as you can. Try to join up as soon as you hit the ground. All right, here we go. Go on, Leo. Thule tower, this is 2-3-5-0. I just broke out of the overcast. I'm too low to bail out. I'm gonna attempt a gear-up crash landing. Hey. Who's that? Ike? You all right? Yeah. I guess so. Just my ankle. Just wait a minute now. Don't move. Wait till I close this hatch here. Witch leg is it? Right leg, Dutch. No movin' now. Just lie still. Here. Put that blanket over you. Wait till I get things closed up here. We're darn near buried, Ike. Storn comin' up, too. Oh, that's great. All the air rescue boys need is a good blizzard. Well, It's no use trying to find the crew out there now. Not a chance. The bailed out miles from here. Let me take a look at that leg. Hold that. Davenport's got the emergency radio. - That's one thing. - Yeah. Good thing the guys in back bailed out in time. Yeah. They'd have had it. This ankle's broken. Here. Can you reach that first aid thing there? Hold that. Why didn't you bail out? Waited too long, I guess. I was trying to give them a continuous voice fix. You mean you kept talking till we hit? Oh!, just in case we were off course. Well, I'd say you were rigth on course, Ike. Is this all of them, sir? All but Dutch and Nolan. No sign of the wreck, General. Why couldn't they have had the same luck we had? Why couldn't they have come down with an Eskimo Village in their lap? Let's get back out there, Lieutenant. I'm going with you. How's the arm, Dutch? Oh, it's pretty good, but it's still sore. Up around the shoulder joint there. I think I'll have another look. Anything doing? No. It's still pretty gusty. Our smoke signal's burning fine. Close the blister, will you, Dutch? We don't need any more ventilation. All right. You know... you know, with only 4 hours of daylight, it might take quite a while finding us. I hope not. I'd like to get out of this igloo. I supoose they've notified our wives we're missing, huh? They'd have to after 2 days. Sally's a wonderful sport about everything, but after all, when you're having your first child, this is rough. When is it due? When's it due? I don't right now! Maybe now! How do I know? Here I am out in a pile of snow. Hey, sit down, Colonel, sit down. We've got trouble enough without you pacing up and downlike a nervous father. Don't suppose it does much good. What do you want, Dutch? A boy or a girl? Oh... Boy, I guess, but I just have a hunch it's a girl. Never. I'll bet you on it. - You want to bet? - I'll bet you 5 bucks it's a girl. - Did you hear something? - No. No, there. Listen. That... Hey, Colonel, what are you doing down there awol? Say, I want to get a message to my wife. She's already been notified that you'r ok, sir. This came for you a couple days ago, sir. A baby girl. Just happened to have this handy, sir. Well, have one. Thank you, sir. Hey, Rusty, it's a baby girl. Congratulations, pappy. Look. It says right here a baby girl. That's great, Dutch. What do you know? A baby girl. Amazing, Colonel. 6 pounds, 5 ounces it says. It's a good thing we found you, Colonel. 6 pounds. What do you know? She wants to know about a name. Well, what about... can you get a message to her right away? Yes, sir. I'll take care of it. Before you do anything else, why don't you go get washed up, get some hot food and have that shoulder looked at? We have about a half an hour before General Hawkes gets here. We got word a couple of hours ago that he's landing here on his way back from England. Oh, yeah! Well, that figures. Yeah. Here. Get that off right away, will you? Yes, sir. And, uh, this one for the General. How much time was there on number one engine? 341 hours, sir. Did you inspect the fuel tanks personally before takeoff? Yes, sir. Captain Symington and Sergeant Bible, too. Any fuel stains? No, sir. How much time did you spend pre-flighting the aircraft? Over 4 hours, and that's not including engine run-ups. You consider your flight engineer fully qualified? I consider him the best in the business, General. Well, Rusty, there's no use trying to get the rest of this picture until Holland meets the investigating board. But accidents don't just happen, Colonel Holland. There's always a reason. As Aircraft Commander you're completely responsible, even if a wing drops off. especially if a wing drops off. I'm leaving for Carswell in an hour. Would you like a lift? Yes, sir. We'll continue this on my airplane. Yes, sir. Flight surgeon seen that arm yet? No, sir, but I've talked to him. I'm OK. I'll have it checked as soon as I get back. It's just a bruise up on my shoulder, General. Make sure of that. Yes, sir. I want the latest results of your last performance and stability tests as soon as possible. Yes, sir. That cigar, sir. Doesn't the General know the aircraft might explode? It wouldn't dare. While we're gassing up I've got something to show you. Yes, sir. Holy smokes. So this id the B-47, huh? She's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life, General. Just look at her. Look at her. I sure would like to get my hands on one of these. Maybe you will, Dutch. Maybe you will. How are you, sweetie? Oh, how are you? Hey, what are you doing home from the hospital so soon? The birth rate of Carswell must have jumped up or something. Boy, they were so crowded. They sure got rid of me in a hurry. What? Well, you seem to beall in one piece. Was it very bad? No. I sure oiled up an airplane, though. We were all mighty lucky. The main things was I just kept worrying about you. I knew we were all right. Oh, so did I, really. I kept listening to the radio reports every day. I knew you were coming back. You just had to. Oh!, yeah, sure. Especially me being a father and everything. A father. Well, where's the baby? Where are you hiding the baby? Oh, she'll be here. Oh, she's so pretty. - She is? - Yeah. Dutch, are you terribly disappointed because she's a little girl? Disappointed? I'm delighted. I won 5 bucks from Mike Knowland on it. Wait. I've got a present for you, all the way from Thule. My goodness. It looks as big as the baby. A penguin. I couldn't get a polar bear. Oh, but I didn't ask for anything but a husband, and I got him. Here we are. Dutch, I want you to meet your daughter. Well... Well,... Well, how do you do, young lady? Very glad to meet you. She says she is, too. Would you like to hold her, Colonel? Would you like to hold her? I'm not checked out on this, but... Oh, OK! She's not very big, is she? - No. - She sure is cute. What did you name her? Just what you said. Hope. Hope? Hope? I said Hope? Well, yes, that's what you said in your telegram. "Can't think of any name but Hope. "Everything fine. Oh, honey, see, I said, "Can't think of any name, "but Hope everything fine. Well, Hope. That's a pretty nice name. Yeah. What do you think of the name Hope? She says she likes it fine. All right. It's OK with me if it's OK with you. I think it's really pretty. Well, Hope, it is, then. Well, now, you say good bye to your father. Good bye, Hope. I guess I'll be seeing you around. That's was sort of a silly thing to say. She's gonna like it in Florida. Florida. Oh, I forgot to tell you. We're gonna move. When? In about 2 weeks. I've been transferred to MacDill. We're going back to our old house. Oh!, that's wonderful. We'll be there just in time to watch the spring training. How did that happen? They're setting up a new B-47 wing. General Hawkes gave me a chance to get in on the ground for. General Hawkes? What's a B-47? It's a new jet bomber, and it's the most beautiful, wonderful airplane you've ever seen in your whole life. Sally, this is the most wonderful thing you could ever imagine. In the B-36. We've got a good long range heavy bomber, but we've needed a medium bomber to replace our World War II types. The B-47 can fill that need and greatly increase the overall capabilities of the Strategic Air Command. It's been under development for 8 years. It's the fastest operational jet bomber in the world. Recently it was timed at a ground speed of 794 miles per hour, and it's ceiling is over 40.000 feet. This wing is so clean that mechabics have to wear soft soled shoes If they walk on it. A scuff on this metal skin could slow it down 20 miles an hour. With the new family of nuclear weapons, on B-47 and a crew of 3 carries the destructive power of the entire B-29 force we used against Japan. Up until now the B-47 has been in the hands of test pilots. It looks good. We don't now how good until it's been proved out by our regular S.A.C. crews. That'll be General Castle's job with the first new wing at MacDill. I want to see a year of flying crammed into 6 months. I'll tell you why I'm in a hurry. When units of all 3 S.A.C. Air Forces are equipped with B-47's, our overall mobility will be doubled. It all boils down to less danger of war. With each B-47 delivered, S.A.C's capability of quick retaliation is increased, and an enemy would undoubtedly know it. We'll be better able to realize S.A.C.'s best hope: to prevent a war from ever starting. I've called you to Omaha for the special briefings that will follow because each one of you is gonna be a key man in the B-47 program. Let's leave it this way. The B-47 is on third base. It'll be up to you to bring it home. Canopy Coming closed. You all squared away, Ike? Ok, Dutch. How about you, Rocky? Roger. MacDill tower, this is 5024. We're ready to go. 5024, you are cleared for takeoff. Roger, 5024. Rolling. Arm A.T.O. Fire A.T.O. Air force 5024. This is eagle control. Say again. We're just in time. The B-47 is on a bomb run. Eagle control, this is Air Force 5024. Type a bomb run, radar, observer, Major Knowland, I.K., altitude 43.000, 43.000 feet. Type of release, automatic, over. Eagle control, Roger. Give us a call when you depart the I.P. Eagle control, this is 5024 departing I.P. Roger. Ike, you all set? Roger. Ok, it's your airplane. We are 25 miles out. Roger. Tour tone is loud and clear. Standing by for information. Bomb away. Dutch, that's a shot. You mean this city's been wiped out theoretically in a storm by a bomber we didn't even see or hear? Sure. With radar, weather's no problem. We've been bombing cities every day and every night all over the U.S., only people never know it. What? Seventh hour stretch. Thanks, Ike. Hey, Rocky, we've got about an hour and a half more to go. Do you want to take it the rest of the way and shoot the landing? Roger. You have it. That shoulder again? No. I'm stiff all over. Who isn't? Pop the chute. Say, you know, that boy's got a lot on the ball. He could be another Bobby Feller. Oh!, he looks great. He won 18 for Rochester last year. Dutch, will you stop looking at your watch? You said you don't take off until midnight. Well, honey, I'm not hopping a streetcar, you know? A mission like this takes 6, 7 hours pre-flight briefing. And what about the 4 days between missions? You've only had 2. I know, I know. I'm filling in for Charlie. You could watch the rest of the inning, anyway. All right, all right. Hey, I just noticed those eagles. When did you make chicken, Colonel Dutch? Couple weeks ago. They figure we needed the raise on account of the baby. She's not kidding. How a Sergeant with 5 kids makesit, I don't know. Well, I'll say this much for General Hawkes. He's certainly doing everything he can for them. Struck him out. 2 in a Row. Honey, I've got to go. Bye. Now look, this time I don't want any penguins. I'll bring you a pelican. Bye, Tom. Bye, Colonel. What's the matter, Sally? Oh, nothing. I was just wondering where he's going this time. Hello, Sally. How are you? Oh, hi, Rusty! I'm fine. How are you?. Fine, fine. May I present General Hawkes? It's a real pleasure, Mrs. Holland. I've been looking forward to meeting you. Same here. Only I'm a little disappointed. I thought you'd be breathing fire. Well, I usually do. I just had a flame-out. Oh, well, if you're here recruiting, please don't take Brewster. Oh, no! I'm a great ball fan. Oh, good. Why don't you tell that to Mr. Doyle? Mr. Doyle, General Hawkes. How do you do, Mr. Doyle? Thank you for letting us in. My pleasure. Won't you sit down? Thank you. So you're the man that stole my third baseman. I wish we could keep him, too. I'll bet you do. So you're on Mr. Doyle's side, eh? Yes, I am. Well, we've got a job to do, Mrs. Holland, and getting men like your husband isn't easy. Don't tell me your little problems General. I'm only interested in results. Touche. Hello. Oh, mother!, it's you. Nothing, nothing at all. It's just that every time Dutch goes on one of these missions I just die. No, of course he doesn't know. No, and he never will. No, no, but he should be here any minute. Yes, it was a long flight. Please don't ask me. I never know where he's going. Look, mother. We thought we'd take you all to the officers' club. You know, for dad's birthday, if Dutch is here. Well, I haven't had a chance to ask him yet. Oh, here he is. I'll call you back. Oh, hi. That's a real bear hug. Oh, I'm just so glad to see you. How are you? I'm fine. Was it rough? No, no. Everything went off fine. It was like clockwork. My shoulder bothered me the last couple of hours, but outside of that... How's the baby? Oh, she's fine. She's still asleep. Listen. You know, Tuesday is Dad's birthday, and I thought we'd take them to the officers' club. You'll still be here, won't you? Yeah. I think so. It all depends on the operations schedule. You won't be going on another mission that soon. Honey, I don't know. All I know is we should be. Should be? You shouldn't be flying at all. Dutch, why don't you go and see the doctor? Every time you go on one of these trips, when you come back your shoulder is much worse. You know how flight surgeons are. It's not that bad. I'm not taking any chances. Now, honey, I know what I'm doing. You're so tired, you don't know what you're doing. All right, all right, all right. I'll fix you some breakfast. Then you should go to bed. All right, all right. So this will be the first overseas movement of an entire jet bomber wing. While we're at it, we've been ordered to try something a little special: a new record. 30 B-47s will make a routine refueling stop at Seattle. But the other 15 airplanes will attempt to fly from MacDill to Japan nonstop. Now, General Espy has some additional information. The flight will be 7.400 statute miles in almost 16 hours. I will fly number one position of the nonstop group. Colonel Holland will fly number 15. Lights. Now here's the plan. This operation will be carried out in 3 phases. First we'll move the wing bag and baggage. Everything, spare engines, fuel trucks and maintenance crews. Tomorrow at 08:00, globemaster cargo aircraft will load the men and equipment. The second starts the following morning at 06:00 when our KC-97 tankers will take off so as to be in place here... and here. For in-flight refueling rendezvous with the B-47s, who will proceed to destination, Yokote. Lights. And third, the B-47s will depart when ordered. All B-47 combat crews will stand by. A word of caution. There is a security blackout. Let's do it first, then talk about it. She's still asleep. Does that child sleep all afternoon? I have to get home. Oh, now, she'll be awake soon. You just be patient. - Patient? I haven't seen her since yesterday. - True. Hello. No, Colonel Holland isn't here. This is Mrs. Holland. Oh, it's long distance, mother. Tom Doyle. Hi, Tom. How are you? Oh, I'm fine. She's just fine. No, he's over at the base. You can reach him at MacDill. I see. Yeah, I see. Oh, I'm sure he can. Oh, yeah, me? You know I'm all for it. Fine. Fine, then I'll see you in a few days. Bye, Tom. Hooray, hooray, hooray! God bless Tom Doyle, Brewster, and everybody in St. Louis. What's come over you? Oh, the most wonderfull thing just happened! What? Brewster broke his leg. Oh, wonderful? The poor boy. Oh, I'm sorry about it, of course, but don't you see? This puts Tom in a spot, and he wants Dutch to come back and finish the season. You know, I'd almost forgotten Dutch was a baseball player. Oh, gosh, so had he. Oh, but he'd never turn Tom down. He'd love this, and you know, this settles everything. Well, if you're going to St. Louis, I'd say it unsettles everything. Oh, no, Mom. No more long missions, no more worrying. Sally, I hope it all works out for you. Oh, it will, Mom. It really will. Where are you going? I have to find the sports page to catch up on a few things. You know, I don't even know the Cardinal lineup anymore. Well, this just came out of the blue. You know I want to do everything I possibly can to help. Uh-huh, yeah. That's right. Well, let me call you in an hour, huh, Tom? What's your number? What is it? 4728. I'll call you in an hour. Right. - Hi. - Hi. Did Tom get you? Yeah, yeah. Talked to him twice. You know, he called here first, and he told me all about it. I suppose you'll still have to make the flight, anyway. Well, we've been standing by all day for weather and word from S.A.C. How soon can you get away? Sally, I had to turn Tom down. I had to make a decision, and I made it. I'm not getting out at all. I'm staying in the Air Force permanently. Oh, you don't... I know it's rough on you. I know how you feel. I took all that into consideration, but when I got rigth down to rock bottom, this was the only thing I could do. But you've served your 21 months. There's no use arguing. It's all settled. I've signed up. You just went ahead and made this decision all by yourself? There are some decisions you have to make alone. So this is going to be it? The Air Force... for the rest of your life and mine. One station after another, one mission after another. And you just walk in here and calmly tell me this. Well, there are times when you are given certain responsibilities. You can't ignore them. Well don't you have any responsibilities to Hope and me? Is it always General Hawkes? General Hawkes didn't have anything to do with it. Oh, he's been working on you for months. Flattering you, promoting you. Sally, if there was a war on, you wouldn't question any of this. Well, that's just it. There isn't. But there is a kind of war. We've got to stay ready to figth without fighting. That's even tougher. That's why I made this decision. You made it. We didn't. All these months I kept telling myself, "It isn't how much you're together that counts. "It's that you are together. And... and now, suddenly, we're not together at all. Oh, Dutch, what's happened to you? I just don't even know you anymore. I... I'm still the same. And here I am all alone with a stranger. Colonel Holland. Ok, I'll be right over. Word just came through from S.A.C. I have to go. Sally, I can't go this way. What difference does it make? We couldn't be any farther apart, even if you were in Tokyo. Hey, Dutch, let's go! Armadillo flying taxi runway 2-2, wind is south 1-0. Altimeter 3-0-1-1. Hello, Sergeant. This is Mrs. Holland. Can you please tell me if Colonel Holland has left yet? You what? You don't... W... well, then where can I find General Castle? The control tower. No, nevermind. Where can I find General Castle? Has Dutch left yet? Oh, I'm sorry, Sally, but Dutch took off about 5 minutes ago. Oh, there's something I've got to hell him. I can't let him go this way. I wish there was something we could do, Mrs. Holland. Well, I'm affraid there isn't, General, and I hope you're satisfied. Wasn't one war enough for you without calling him back just when he was beginning to live? And you gonna let him go on and on? How much more do you want? Sally. I'm sorry you fell that way, Mrs. Holland, but I want you to understand one thing. This was Dutch's decision, not mine. His decision because you maneuvered him into it. Promoting him, putting him in important jobs. Now let's get one thing straight. If you think I promoted him because he was Dutch Holland, you underestimate him. He's an exceptional commander. Dutch earned this the hard way. I just hope he can get through this mission. There any reason. He shouldn't be on this mission? I think there's every reason. And someday, when he cracks, it's gonna be because you didn't give him any choice. Mrs. Holland... I, too, have no choice. 45 aircraft now airbone, Dutch. OK, navigator, how we doing? On course. On time, Dutch. Roger. In 6 minutes the formation will break up, and we'll proceed on our individual flight plan. There's our fuel tanker. Right on schedule. Air Force 3-4-1-1, what'll you have, ethyl or regular? Ah, whatever you've got. Just fill her up. Your slipway doors are open. Receptacle clear. Everything looks normal. Tanker ready for contact. Receiver ready for contact. Forward 2. Stand by for contact. Roger. Contact. Contact. Roger. Up 3. Your position is good. Fuel pressure 35 pounds. Tranfer completed. Disconect when ready. Roger. Just caught a sports broadcast, Dutch. You're front page news. All about your passing up baseball for an Air Force career. Call that news, huh? How about you, Ike? Made up your mind yet? You staying in? Oh, I guess I might as well. Seems like quite a few of the boys are staying in. You started quite a fashion, Dutch. We bumped into a 129 headwind, Dutch. Jet stream. 40 knots faster than briefed. We've lost 13 minutos already. Well... Well, we better do something about that, Ike. Leo, what do you think? Think we better try and get over it? If we stay under it, we'll use too much fuel, that's for sure. How much higher do you think we'll have to go, Ike, to get out of the jet stream? Oh, maybe 2 or 3.000 feet. Well, that altitude's kinda critical for us at this weight. I think maybe we better try it, though. Here we go. Well, that's about as high as she'll go. How much longer we got, Ike? 5 hours, 11 minutes. Well, we're preactically there. I went crazy the first 10 hours. My hellmet's killing me, and I feel like I'm sitting on a block of concrete. I'll trade you that block of concrete for this picket fence I'm sitting on. You guys should've been navigators. At least you can get off this seat once in a while. Air Force 3-4-1-1, This is Yokota tower. Ceiling is still variable from 1 to 400 feet. Fog. Visibility varying from 1/4 mile to 2 miles. Occasionally zero. Uh, how about the other airplanes? They all land OK, Yokota? Affirmative. The last one barely made it. Conditions may improve in 30 minutes. Can you hold? Well, I... not if I have to go to an alternate. What's the forecast? 3-4-1-1, Okinawa is reporting broken and still V.F.R. Your other alternates are still instrument and bellow minimums. Well, If I'm going to Okinawa, I have to leave right now. My fuel reserve's low. Uh, stand by, Yokota. Roger. Yokota, this is 3-4-1-1. Proceeding to Kadena Air Force base, Okinawa. Roger. Yokota tower out. Air Force jet 3-4-1-1. This is Kadena aproach control. You're now 68 miles out. Weather getting worse. Ceiling dropping rapidly. You've got 3 miles and 500 feet. Now you tell me. That's a fine how do you do, Kadena. I got 11 minutes fuel and 9 more minutes to go. It's gonna be a close one. Air Force jet 3-4-1-1, contact GCA on 1-18.2 and stand by for immediate jet penetration. Affirmative. Affirmative. Air Force jet 3-4-1-1, You're cleared for immediate jet penetration. Dutch? Hey, Leo. Yeah, Dutch? There's... There's something wrong. I... Leo... I... I can't move my right arm, Leo. Leo, you take ahold of the throttles. Reduce your power 10%. Roger. A little more. Hup. There you are. All right, now... You handle the throttles, I'll handle the controls, OK? Roger. Wheater now reporting 100 feet. Visibility 1/4 of a mile. Advise you hold east of the outer marker. Uh, negative. Negative, Kadena. I can't hold. I'm committed. I don't have enough fuel to go around. Go on now. Bring me on in. Affirmative. Continue your penetration. Air Force jet 3-4-1-1, This is your final controller. You need not acknowledge any further transmissions. You're 6 miles from the end of the runway, 40 feet above the glide path. Increase your rate of descent. You have now passed through the GCA minimums. I will hold your rate of descent. You're right at the center line. Steer to a heading of 1-7-5 degrees. All right. Back another 5%, Leo. Roger. A little more. Now forward. A little more. All right. Back a little. There you are. Hold it. Your course is good. Your rate of descent is good. Now steer to 1-8-0 degrees. You're on glide path. You're on course. Your heading is 1-8-0 degrees. You're on glide path. You're on course. You're 2 miles from the end of the runway. Your heading is 1-8-0 degrees. Your rate of descent is good. You're on course. You're approaching the end of the runway. You're now over the end of the runway. Take over visually. We're breaking out, Dutch. I can see the ground. All right, back a little more. I got the runway. Hold up. Hold up. All the way back. All the way back, Leo. All right, fine. Pop the chute. Thanks, GCA. Thanks for getting us down, fellas. Surprised you can use that arm at all. Well, the inflammation's gone down already, sir. In just 3 days. I ordered you back to Omaha, Colonel Holland, because of this medical report. It indicates a chronic condition. Might happen again any time. Especially on long, high altitude flights. I suppose that's true, General. You know, I ougth to throw the book at you. For not following existing instructions about reporting to a flight surgeon after an accident. For concealing a condition that could have grounded you. Yes, sir. What you did could have resulted in the loss of your aircraft and your crew. Until this last mission, sir, It was nothing more than annoying. I wouldn't have taken such a risk. I'm inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt. I suppose you know you're all through flying. Yes, sir. You can't command an operational unit. You can stay in, of course, at a ground job. Would you like that? No, sir. I didn't think you would. I'm going to let you go. You're out of the Air Force as of now. Is your wife here yet? No, sir. I haven't seen her since we left MacDill. I don't suppose you can play much ball with that shoulder. No, sir. Not this season, anyway, sir. What are to do? I'm sure Tom Doyle will have a spot picked out for me, sir. Well, if he doesn't make a manager out of you, he's crazy. Well, that's fine with me. Let's hope so. Good luck to you. I'm sorry it had to end this way, sir. So am I, Holland. Damn sorry. I hate to lose you. Thank you, sir. Dutch... Dutch, I... I suppose that you know better than anybody else... what an uphill battle it is to keep S.A.C. going. The job is big and the pay is small. The things that I've fought for... better family housing, better breaks for the combat crews and the non-coms. The things that help us to get the best people and keep the best people. and 80% of them, reserve officers and citizen soldiers just like you. Dutch... None of these things are easy to come by. We need all the help we can get. Yes, sir. I want you to know this: The job you did while you were with us, and the decision you made when you had an easy out, gave us more help than you'll ever realize. We're grateful to you. I'm glad to hear that, sir. General Hawkes, will you please tell Colonel Holland that Mrs. Holland is here? She says to tell him she'll be waiting for him in General Wheatley's office. Ask her to come in. Hello, Sally. Remember me? I'm that stranger. Well, sure. I'd know you anywhere. You couldn't fool me. I don't care what uniform you're wearing. You're still my husband. I'm very proud of you. I'm ashamed of me. We, uh... We had a medical report on that arm, Mrs. Holland. I've got to let him go. He's all yours. Is that it? That's it. That's our new B-47 wing Flying its first training mission. We'll have 4 full new wings by the end of the year.
