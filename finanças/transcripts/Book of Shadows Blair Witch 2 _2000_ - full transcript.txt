( Screaming ) Josh! Hi, I'm Kurt Loder with MTV news. The film is "The Blair Witch Project"... Critics have called it one of the scariest films of all time... I was terrified. Oh, it scared me to death... It all starts out lighthearted as three documentary filmmakers armed with a 16mm camera and a video camcorder head into the black hills forests of Maryland to make a movie about a legendary witch. And they're never heard from again. There's no doubt about the box office success of "The Blair Witch Project," what's not clear, though, is whether the "Blair Witch" legend is true. "Blair Witch" fans are not only flocking to the multiplex, they're flooding the little town of Burkittsville, Md. People have started coming to Burkittsville as if it were Charles Manson's Spahn ranch, or ed the serial killer's house to visit. A haunted place. And Burkittsville isn't a haunted place. It's a place that a fictional movie was set in. I wasn't able to see the movie when it first came out, because I was... In the hospital, but as soon as they let me out, I was at the movie theater 17 times in a row. - The web site really sold me. - Yeah. The web site... you know, has all these police photos, and official police things, and all this information, and you really believe it. Our stick men sold so well on the Internet, that we started selling them in the front yard, them somebody came by to buy them, and wanted rocks. So we went out back and got rocks out of my rock garden, I didn't want to get rid of them so the guy offered me $10 after he started booting it up more. His wife really wanted them, so we sold them to him. We sold some rocks on the Internet, but not as much, because it costs too much to ship a rock. Everybody that comes to town just goes by like this... I'm so used to being videoed. I make sure, if I go to my car, or out to get the paper, that I at least have full makeup on, you know, and a great nightgown. I wish that they'd used a fictitious town. And possibly thought ahead toward what type of repercussions could come from using the word, "documentary" in their advertising, and on their web site. Get out of these woods, and go home! There was no goddamn Blair Witch! You know, there are a lot of naysayers who come and say nay, but then, there are a lot of supporters who come up to my town, and come up to me... Do you know what they do? They run up, they stop... Hey, Selena... they come over to me, and they hug me, and say, "dude, I know it's real," and they squeeze me, and I squeeze them back, and I say, "I know it's real, too, man," and we have a bond, you know? We have a connection. So, I say, "I know, and they go, "I know, man." And I go, "I know." ( Screaming ) You thinking you're a wise ass? I didn't do anything wrong!

Woman: Could you turn that down just a hair? Man: I'm just trying to set the mood for the mission. I know, and that's awfully sweet, but I feel like I'm gonna toss. She's been feeling a little queasy. No need to explain, concern. Fort is my ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Mr. Stephen Ryan Parker who has three names, so he must be from Boston. Apparently he's here researching a book, with his girlfriend. The book's title is... "The Blair Witch... History, or hysteria?" "Hysteria, or history?" Why is it you guys can't get on the same page about the witch, anyway? We've always been misunderstood. We embrace nature, not evil. Thank you, Erica. ( Erica laughing ) Not only a hottie, but a real witch. Blessed be. Wiccan... Wicc it good. ( Laughing ) Stephen: Wait... why are we slowing down? Jeff: This is where your other tourmate asked us to meet her. She's a little weird. She thinks she's psychic or some shit. When's the last time you talked to her? E-mail, two days ago. Are you sure she didn't change her mind? Yeah... Kim! - Kim? Kim! - Yo. Is that her? Kim? - Yeah. - I'm Jeff. I figured. What are you doing there? Trying to find the energy. Inside the grave? To stand up. I'm exhausted. I've been on the road for two days. - Want a hand? - I want amphetamines. Weed is what I've got, beer I'm gonna get. Both... now. Jeff: That's right, friends, for two luxurious days and nights, my friends, you will walk the same path the witch herself once walked. Sleep on the same soil where her victims' blood was spilled. Possibly losing your own souls in the process. And I want to thank you all for coming on the inaugural tour of "The Blair Witch Hunt." "Inaugural"? You mean you've never done this before? - Never. - That's not what your web site said. "Over 10,000 satisfied customers." No, that's my web store. Stick me, t-shirts, official Blair dirt. Tours... We're all virgins on this bus! Here? You drove by a Safeway two Miles back. That was in Burkittsville. I don't shop in Burkittsville I don't even piss there. Kim: Hell of a town you got here. What century are they living in? Yeah, the gene pool is a little shallow here. Dive in, you'll crack your skull open. Jeff: Okay. So, where are we going first? The ruins if Rustin Parr's house. Erica: That guy who heard the voices to kill, right? Jeff: Yeah, seven little kids were. Kim: Man, I hear voices all the time. ( Cracking ) Do we need all this shit for a walk in the woods? "The Blair Witch Hunt" provides all amenities while you risk certain death and dismemberment. - Give it up. - What's with this camera? To record all occult phenomena that may manifest itself in the course of the tour. Damn... you're really running "bullshit central," aren't you? If you don't believe in the Blair Witch, then why the hell did you bother to come? I thought the movie was cool. - How much further? - A couple more Miles. Jesus. - How far along are you? - What do you mean? The baby. How many weeks? Six. You don't want to keep it, do you? No. But Stephen wants the baby. Yes. How did you know? I don't know. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Jeff: Welcome to the Parr ruins, ladies and gentlemen. It's supposed to be where they found Heather's footage. These markings are incredible. Erica: Ancient witches' alphabet. Stephen: Looks like recent graffiti to me. Tristen: They're so realistic. It's a little scary. Actually, some of these symbols are quite positive. Only those who don't understand witchcraft would be afraid of them. And remember, fear... Is the forerunner of failure. Okay. What's the story with this tree? What tree? Look behind you. Jeff: Where the fuck did this come from? This was never here before. - Nice try, dude. - What does that mean? Maybe you should drop the tree bit from your next tour. No, no, I'm not making this up. - I need a beer. - Me, too. Hey, geniuses, explain to me... Why a house built in 1826 was built around a tree. This would have been sticking straight up through the living room. Jeff, nobody's scared. ( Screaming ) "Evil intent in the ground," may a release soon be found. "In peace, release the energy that be through my magic." Are you casting some kind of evil spell? Reversing the evil. The first law of Wicca is, "harm none," 'cause whatever you do, is going to come back at you threefold. The karma's a bitch. What are you really doing? - Communing with Elly Kedward. - The Blair Witch? I thought you embraced nature, not evil. You don't understand. Elly... Was a good witch. She was an earth child, like me. She's gonna be my mentor. - You've spoken with her? - Not yet... But I will. That's why I'm here. To shed my mortal coil... And commune with Elly. Tristen: Have you ever seen her picture? I don't think there are any. Stephen and I found one. Check it out. We think it was drawn before they banished her from Blair. "Banished," my ass. They dragged her into the woods in the middle of winter, and tied her to a tree to die. You make her sound helpless. I thought witches could summon powerful energy. We can... But we still have to eat, shit, and die like the rest of you. We just look good doing it. What do you need all these cameras for? I'm personally hoping for an Elly Kedward sighting. I've got a big beta for a quality master, I got a night vision, I got an infrared, a cute little mini dv, handhelds for everyone... This baby can even do frame-a-second time lapse. If anything comes in for a visit, we'll catch it. May I have permission to take this leaf? Thank you. Erica: "Evil intent in the ground", "may your release soon be found." "And peace release the energy that be from my magic." "Evil intent in the ground," "may your release soon be found." "And peace release the energy that be for my magic." Stephen: Okay, wait... How many Heather Donahues does it take - to screw in a light bulb? - How many? ( Screaming ) Just one! ( Laughter ) Just one of them! Do you know what I could never figure out? What's that? "Blair Witch Project"... Two guys and a girl, sleeping in the same tent... Night after night, and no sex? - It makes no sense. - You're so right. I mean, they were scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever right at their fingertips... And nothing. I'm a little stressed. Try some more weed. Okay. The Bermuda triangle. It's a place in the world that's been created by hysteria. By people's own psychology, by their own ideas of the place. We were already a persecuted minority. This whole "Blair Witch" thing set us back 300 years. It's like we're back in the burning times. Just totally fucked up our image. Erica, people fear what they don't understand. - You've gotta realize that. - No shit. People think... That I drink blood, that I sacrifice children. That I worship the devil just because I'm a wiccan. Where I come from, people think because I dress in black, I'm some kind of sick killer or something. I don't even believe in the devil. That's a Christian concept. I believe in nature. I hate nature. Myth... for me, right? Is just myth. It's not history, it's not even metaphor, and it's definitely not the truth... Stephen, stories like this happen because they exist in a place of truth. There's historical evidence, there's fact. That's what you don't understand. Jeff: I want to make a film. "Wicca... A way of life." - Nice. - Yeah. Wait, wait... Check this out. Look at everyone. Everyone is obsessed with the Blair Witch... For their own reasons, including us. "Goth... A way of life." A documentary on you. All real, all video. Video never lies, Kim. Film does, though. Everyone wants to see something. I'm telling ya, hysteria and delusions, they breed in situations like this. Why are you applying rational thought to mythology? Because if people believe something enough, isn't it real? If people believe something enough, isn't it real? "Perception is reality." You're not listening to me. Babe, I know what you're saying, I just think it's bullshit. I think you're being a monomaniacal reductionist. ( Eerie shrieking ) What the hell was that? I heard that, too. "Burkittsville's funniest home videos!" You scared the shit out of me, man! It answered every single one of your wet dreams. What the hell are you guys doing here? We've got a tour group, "The Blair Witch Walk." What's your excuse? Tour group... "The Blair Witch Hunt"! I don't believe this. You're supposed to look out for stuff like this. This is so not happening! We have jurisdiction here. We have permits. Oh, yeah? From cravens? Bullshit. Let me see 'em. - Bullshit! - They're in the car. Bullshit! Rival: Let's put it this way... One of us is staying tonight... It's gonna be us or you, and it looks like us, you little bitch! It's gonna come back at you threefold, man. - What's she saying? - In the wiccan tradition... Shut up! Your balls will fall off in three days! Yo, guys... I think I can settle this. Just give us till dawn, and then we're out of here. We're cold, we're tired... And we're a little shook up. We saw something up at coffin rock today. Yeah... Yeah, up at coffin rock. It scared the shit out of us. Guys, stop talking about it, because I am gonna freak. I just want to go home. Can we see this thing... "coffin rock"? Whatever. It's your money, Greta. Next time, you guys take the "Blair Witch Walk." Next time, take "The Blair Witch Hunt." Here's my card. Call me. I'm on the web. ( Giggling ) "They were never seen again." Their footage was found a year later... Underexposed, and useless. I don't trust that these assholes aren't coming back. They're going to be pissed that we took the foundation. I don't think it's anything to worry about. Besides... We're gonna be up all night, baby! ( Howling ) Giddy-up! We'll just keep our eyes open. They're not coming back. Why do you think that? I just do. Kim: Back in a minute. Up all night! How do your parents feel... About having a witch for a daughter? My father is... An episcopal minister, in a one church town back in Munnsville, Illinois. Yeah. That's a bummer. How many beers is that for you? I'm serious! You're drinking like a freakin' fish! I just think you should take care of yourself. Jesus! We've already gone through this today. ( Man screaming ) ( Baby crying ) What's going on? What the fuck...? This is my work. This is all my research. Our work. Every word. Where the fuck are my cameras? Stephen: This is all of our goddamn work! How the hell are we gonna make the deadline? We backed it up on the computer. No, Tristen, the computer's just notes. Half this shit is original documents. Where the hell was everybody? We were all supposed to be awake. Guys, where's Erica? I'm right here. We must have fallen asleep. "Asleep"? It's like we must have blacked out! The last thing I remember was that other tour group. Yeah... Those fucking dickweeds! Who else could it have been, huh? They came back from coffin rock, and ripped us off! Kim: "Ripped"? These things look like they were bit off! I... what am I gonna do? At least the tapes are still here. What? The tapes... They're here. But where? Do you see them? In my mind, I see them. Oh, Jesus. You fucker. They're there! Where they "found" the "Blair Witch" tapes? You've got to be kidding me. Come on. Why would they be in there? News flash, everybody... That was just a movie. I don't know why, Stephen. They're under the rocks. There's nothing in there. Reach inside. Well...? I don't feel so hot. Jeff, is there anything in there? Erica: Jesus Christ. How did those get in there? Are they yours? I think we should leave. How did you know? - I don't know. - Are they yours? Did you put them in there? Did you?! - Jeff, are they your tapes? - Yeah, they're my tapes! Then, why are they still here? Why is the equipment trashed, the cameras are gone, but the tapes are still here? Stephen: She's right, Jeff. Wouldn't those guys want to fuck up your tour footage? Stephen, I want to leave. How did this happen? Oh, fuck...! Jesus Christ, the baby. We found blood in the van. Tristen had a miscarriage. You know that, cravens. She bled in the van on the way to the hospital. This girl's hypothermic. Get me heating blankets and a lamp. How did she get so cold? It's like she's been sitting in ice water. No, we were just camping. Cravens: The doctor thinks it's hypothermia. Of course, the way I see it... You're the one that brought her out here. You took her into those woods. She's your responsibility. Are you charging me with something? You have been... A pain in this town's ass since you were 10. You need to learn to stay out of trouble, boy. It makes you defensive... Anxious. Last thing you need is to end up back in the looney bin. How is she? She lost the baby. Nurse: The doctor wants to keep you here until your temperature stabilizes. You lost a lot of blood. More than usual. It's for the best. Your body was telling you something was wrong. Something was wrong. ( Screaming ) How are you feeling? I'm not staying here. Stephen: Five hours of our lives are unaccounted for. I want to see those tapes. I want to know what happened last night. I've got some cool editing equipment at my house. We should be able to come up with some answers. We're still in the black hills, aren't we? Yeah, right up there. Let's get Tristen inside. Take care of the bags later. I thought we were going to your house. Yeah. R.F.D. 431... Jericho mills, home. Stephen: What did it used to be? It was an old factory after the civil war. They were going to tear it down, but I talked them into selling it to me for a buck. Erica: Cool. Sorry about the bridge... It's the only way in or out. It's pretty safe... Don't lean on the railings. Cravens: I am not... A gambling man. But... I would bet my entire... Retirement pension... That the blood in the van... Is going to match those tourists. You've been looking to pin something on me since I was a kid. ( Dogs barking ) Come on, get in, quick. Before they eat you. Come on. Quick, quick. Let's go. ( Barking ) ( Barking stops ) ( Resumes ) Burkitt county's cheapest burglar alarm. And what's that do? Squirt water? Oh, no... That actually works. Wave. It's recording you right now. I got 'em hooked up through the whole building. What can I say? I'm a little paranoid. Hah! "A little"? I heard that. But with good reason. I got a lot of valuable stuff here. Oh, my God. Kim: Yeah. You wouldn't want somebody to come in here, and steal a bunch of stuff that you've already stolen. Where it comes from originally is none of my business, nor should it be yours. I just like to pass the savings on to others. Really? And how do you do that? E-bay. Buying, selling, trading, swapping. I'm a major player. Thought all your cameras got trashed, Jeff. Well... You can never have too many. Jeff, I think we've had enough videotaping for one weekend. Yeah, dude. Tour's over. Jeff: Maybe the tour has just begun, Erica. Because you're walking into the official Blair store. Come in, everybody. This is where it all begins. This is the epicenter of the "Blair Witch Hunt" web site. Let's see now, I got my sticks... You can touch these, they're for the stick men, don't touch those, those are drying. What else...? Jeff, did you collect these all in the black hills? Yeah, every single twig. Over here we got a rock formation... Oh, my God, who made that?! Oh... I did, earlier. We've got Parr ruins foundation dirt, that's a big item. I sell that. T-shirts and sweat shirts, and hats. Here you go, Tristen. That's for you. Gratis. I feel better. You're as big an asshole as the rest of them. What are you talking about, Erica? This stuff is hot. This is what the wiccan religion really needs, Jeff. More capitalism based on fear and lies. Do you really think it's fair to exploit our culture... Just to sell stick figure key chains? I think this place is cool, Jeff. Thanks. Jeff, we're tired I should get her to bed. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Let's see... The stairs by the kitchen lead to my editing loft, the bedroom on the right is mine, it's got the biggest bed and it's own John, but you guys can take it. - Thanks, brother. - Sure. Sleep well. The rest of the bedrooms are down the hallway. Hey... I really appreciate the hospitality, but, take me off your mailing list. Okay. They should have never let you out. You're a long way from sane. Tristen: I saw something at the hospital. What? It was just like the picture you showed me in the Blair Witch black Bible. The same clothes, that same face, like... She'd been drowned. Who? The little girl. Eileen treacle. Sweetie... Why don't we talk about this after you get some sleep? I want to talk about it now. You need to sleep. You're in shock. This is so... Intense. Chill out, Erica. We've watched half of one tape. We've got four angles, we've got our handhelds, we've got hours of tapes we haven't seen. Last night... When we were camping... I dreamt I hurt the baby. That's just because we've been fighting about it so much. You've been through a lot. I know how much you wanted that baby. I'm sorry I didn't want it. I'm sorry that I lost it. Guys, something just occurred to me. Where's that tree? Kim: What? That big tree that was in the middle of the foundation. Now there's just this tiny twig. See, guys, I told you there was something up with that tree. Hand me another of those dv cassettes. Maybe there's another angle. Whoa, whoa... What is up with that? I don't know. I think it's chafing - from the backpack. - Does it hurt? Not really. It just kind of itches. It's nothing. Here. - What was that? - What? Rewind it. What did you see? I'm not sure. A flash, or something. Coffin rock. What? Coffin rock. How the hell do you see coffin rock? Can you see in other dimensions? I don't know. That's what it reminds me of. Those guys that were murdered there... In 1886, after they were gutted, their heads were arranged in the shape of a pentagram... Like that. The great American pastime, blame it on a witch. Jeff: Let me see if I can get that image back. Tristen: Stephen! Erica: Is she gonna be okay? I don't know. Stephen! Tristen? Tristen? ( Sobbing outside ) ( Barking alarm ) Shut up. Girl's voice: You brought it back with you! ( Shriek ) Tristen: What was all that? That was Jeff's stupid dog alarm. The crying. You heard that, too? In my dreams. I though I was having this horrible nightmare. About what? Children... Looking up my skirt... As I twirled 'round and 'round... So I hurt them. Stephen, what the hell is wrong with me? Nothing. Nothing. You're just... Look, there are... Rational explanations behind this. Behind everything that's going on. I think we need to go home. I'll get someone to drive us to the airport... Not yet. Why? Just not yet. I need to understand what happened. You can understand it on the plane ride home. Here. Take these. Take them. They'll help you sleep. Come on, take them! You're not making a believer out of me, son. It was an accident. I swear to Christ, it was an accident. - Jesus. - Whoa. What the hell was that? I'm not sure. See that? Whoa, wait. Look. Time code goes from 1:32 A.M... To 3:57 A.M... Back to 1:32 A.M. In the middle of the footage? How does that happen? I don't know... But those were the hours that we fell asleep. Can you make it bigger, or slow it down? Let me try slowing it down. Ladies and gentlemen, that is a naked woman. What is a naked woman doing swinging around a tree? Are we sure these are our tapes? I'm not sure of anything in the last 24 hours. Let me try re-digitizing this footage at a higher resolution so I can blow it up. This will take a few minutes. I need alcohol. Caffeine. Caffeine? Sure. I live to serve. Ugh... great. Stale coffee, no beer, some old take-out chicken... But plenty of batteries. Hey... What's going on? We're leaving in the morning. Really? It's... Tristen. She's in bad shape. This whole thing has really fucked her up. How come you're the one who looks like he's having a breakdown? Look... I'm a little tense, all right? Sorry. No, I am... Sorry. I just feel like my whole life's been turned upside down the past two days. I know. It's been really crazy for you, but it's gonna be okay. I promise. - That feels good. - You are tense. - Like that? - Yeah. Lower? Yeah, lower. How does that feel? Good. Lower...? How does that feel? ( Ripping, scraping ) Do they hurt? No. They're just a little warm. Don't worry. I have them, too. Kim: Guys... Want to come up here? You're out of beer, if that's what you want to know. No... Jeff found a better angle on this naked chick. - What naked chick? - Cool. How'd you do it? I took the image and I blew it up. Kim: It's a little weird to watch... Like watching a hold up on bank security cameras. You get the gist. Where is this? Jeff: The foundation. This was last night? Yeah. During the big blackout. Stephen: Can you make it so we can see her face? Sure can. If this is a joke... It ain't funny. No joke. It's serious, Erica. While I was gone, you messed with things. No. It doesn't make any sense. I know. We were hoping you could explain. I don't have a clue. You have no memory of doing this? No. Jeff: If it's some "Wicca" thing, that's okay, you can tell us. Kim: Try and help us understand. All we're trying to do... Is put together the pieces of what happened last night. Find out who trashed my equipment. That wasn't me. I didn't do that. Erica, that's you there on the screen. Leave me the hell alone, all of you! Believe her? I don't know. Jeff, give me your keys to the van. - Where are you going? - I have to get out of here. I need a beer. Hey, see if we need more coffee. ( Erica chanting ) "earth and fire, water and smoke..." I am going to the store. You want to come? Erica...? Erica! We brought something back with us. What are you talking about? I can sense it... Like someone's choking me... And squeezing the air out of me. Look, we're just tired, okay? We're all really tired. That is it. I want to show you something. I have got the same thing. It's nothing. It's like poison oak, or something. But, Kim... They're growing. Erica: Ancient pagan alphabet. They say it means you've been touched by a witch. ( Sobbing ) That you're next chosen to die...! There's something here! There's something here! Sweet. Yo, Morticia. Hey, Elvira, I got something you can suck the blood out of. Oh, yeah? Whip it out. Excuse me, sorry. I'm finished now. What the...?! What is your problem? You're with the witch people. Lady... I'm just here to buy groceries. Witch! Freak. Am I gonna have a problem with you, too? No problem. Good. Let's go. Okay, look... Either you ring this stuff up... Or I call your manager. I am the manager. Really? Well, then, Peggy... Could you tell the bitch at the front register to do her goddamn job? Get the hell out of here! Not until I've completed my purchase. We don't want people like you around here. You know what? I am gonna make this so easy on you, Peggy. I told you to get the hell out of here! You touch me again... And I will rip out your goddamn throat! Keep your motherfucking change! ( Chanting continues ) "Persephone do I invoke..." By earth and fire, and water and smoke, Persephone do I invoke... By earth and fire, and water and smoke, Persephone do I invoke... By earth and fire, and water and smoke, Persephone I invoke... By earth and fire, and water and smoke, Persephone I invoke... ( Rapidly ) By earth and fire, and water and smoke, Persephone I invoke... By earth and fire, and water and smoke, Persephone I invoke... By earth and fire, and water and smoke, Persephone I invoke... ( Sobbing ) By earth and fire, and water and smoke, Persephone I invoke... ( Continues ) ( Crying ) ( Increases music volume ) - Stone the witch! - Stone the bitch! Fucking rednecks! ( Distant crying ) Ow! Jeff: Kim...? Make me a pot of coffee on your way up. You're welcome. Look, I fucked up your front Fender. I had to swerve to avoid hitting these little kids. They were dressed funny, like from another time. Seven of them. Jeff! Look, I know this is crazy, but I know those are the kids that Rustin Parr killed! Coffee. Next to your arm. Morning. Hey, did you sleep okay? Yeah, I slept okay. You? Yeah. You ready to go? Yeah. Are you guys ready? Yeah. I... appreciate your driving us. Yeah. I'll get the keys from Jeff. Come on, Tristen, wake up. Come on, let's go. Not yet... Tristen, we're going home. Erica? Erica! Erica? Erica! Jeff: Not up here. Not up there? You sure? She was just here. Didn't you hear me? I just said she's not up here. Why don't you go check out the v... What the hell happened to the van? Stephen: Jesus Christ. We are never gonna get out of here... Kim, what the hell did you do to my van? You said you just busted up the front end a little! I mean, how the hell did you drive it back? I swear it was just the front Fender. What the fuck is going on?! They dip their hands in your blood and then they press them on your body. What are you talking about? The children. Something I dreamt. Jeff dreamt it, too. Look. Look! Oh, Jesus! What the hell is this? Something from the woods. We've all got them. Me, her, Erica... Where is Erica? Erica? Erica? Erica! What the...? Erica! ( Dog barking ) Erica! Erica!! We would've heard the dog alarm when she went outside. It's like she fucking vanished. Evaporated is more like it. Yeah, right, Kim. You were the one who found her clothes... And those candles. Kim: And what the hell is that supposed to mean? A prank. Two little bitches trying to freak us out. - You paranoid fuck! - Come on! I would never do something like that, and neither would she! Where is she, Kim? Where is she? Why are all her clothes and all her shit still here? How am I supposed to know? Can't you see her, Kimmy? In your mind's eye? Very funny, asshole! Look, I think something really bad has happened to her. Maybe she called somebody. Jeff: I'd like to speak to Minister Geerson, please. Woman: The minister is at a meeting. Could I have him return your call? No. It's urgent. Could I tell him what it's regarding? Yeah. His daughter, Erica. We wanna know if he's heard from her. The minister and Mrs. Geerson have no daughter. No, I know, like, they disowned her or something because she's a witch, but... They've never had any children. ( Dial tone ) So she made up a story. She gave us a fake name. It doesn't have to mean any more than that. She lied to us. Why are we seeing all this shit, okay? Why is all this happening? I don't know. Collective delusion. Group hysteria. It's what I'm writing my book about. You get a bunch of people together, you get them scared enough... Dude, spare us the bullshit. Please. It's real. "Dude." It happens. They teach it at junior colleges I bet that even you could get into. Oh, yeah? And how did you get into yours? Do you have to brush your teeth? Kim: Jeff, the screen. Roll it back, rewind it. No, more. Jeff: Oh, shit. I knew they'd come back and mess with my stuff. ( Telephone rings ) ( Keystroking ) ( Ring ) Fuck off. No one's home. It's cravens. Sheriff? Ha! It's funny. I just found out who trashed my cameras. I was just about to call you. Turn on your TV. I don't give a shit about the TV. I want you to see something. Me too. News at 11:00. Shit. Will you just turn that on? Humor him? - You watching? - Yeah, yeah... Like a hawk. Listen, I'm trying to tell you what I found out on Friday night. This is a special report. A brutal murder in the black hills discovered today. The bodies of five hikers found dead atop the landmark known as coffin rock. Disemboweled, Jeffrey. A grisly re-creation of the infamous coffin rock massacre popularized by the movie "The Blair Witch Project"... Bodies were laid out in the shape of a pentagram. Sound familiar? We have received word that the victims include two tourists from China and one from Germany, as well as two unidentified white males. In the past year, the black hills area has been overrun with movie fans wanting to get a glimpse of where the Blair Witch Project was filmed. Cravens: You looking at me, little man? What? Over here. There. Jeff: Yeah? I didn't find your cameras. Don't guess that surprises either one of us, does it? What do you want from me? I got five corpses here! Look, I had nothing to do with that. You might not have been in charge here, but I know you had something to do with this, so you and your little friends had best just sit tight. And that means... You don't leave this county till I say it's okay. ( Owl hooting ) I don't know you, Stephen. I don't know a thing about you. I don't know how much to believe about any of you people, but from now on... Know this: You are not leaving me here to take the fall for this shit. Nobody is going out of my sight. We brought something back with us. For Christ's sake, Kim... I'll tell you what's going on here. It's Erica... Or whoever the fuck she is. Erica has got nothing to do with this! She's a witch, man! She's one big pissed-off witch! She's been casting fucking spells, and then she's making herself appear, then she makes herself fucking disappear! I mean, it's been her since day one! Smoke it up, 'cause you're not totally psycho yet! Where you going? The fuck away from you! You're a dick. Kim! Jeff, come on, you've got to have friends, somebody with a car... What did I tell you?! You're not going anywhere! Wipe that shit off your face. You think that your makeup and black clothes give you power, but you're just a scared, cowardly little girl underneath all that. You don't understand. Something happened to us in the woods. Something evil. Why are you so mad at me? ( Slurping ) Calm down. I'm not that pissed. Just stop badmouthing Erica. She's outside. Where? Right there. There's nothing out there. Tristen, let's get you back to bed. You just got to look, Stephen. Let's go to the bedroom. Look again. She's out there! ( Dogs barking excitedly ) Erica. What happened to you? Don't be afraid. You know who it is. - What? - And you know... What you have to do. Erica! You know who it is. Erica? Tristen, help me. Help me! Tristen! Aw, Tristen... Stephen, I got you. Quick, pull my hand. Come on, pull up. They did it, the little Buster boys. They did it! They hanged her! The little Buster boys! Tristen! Shh! Shh! It's only a dream. It's only a dream! They're not mine. They're Elly Kedward's dreams! I don't know why I'm having them. Why do you think they're Elly Kedward's? 'Cause I was seeing them through her eyes! Tied to the tree where they banished her to and the bad little boys from Blair village sneaking out to the woods to see if she was still alive... And... and they let their big dogs bite at her, and they poked her with sticks and then... When the blood came out of her, they put their palms in it and pressed it on her flesh! Then, when they found she was still alive... They tied her... And they put the ropes around her neck and they hanged her from the big tree! Stephen, I think I'm going fucking crazy. No! No, you are not going crazy. Do you hear me? You are not going crazy. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. ( Footsteps approaching ) Jeff? Listen, I'm really worried about Tristen. Do you know the name of the doctor she was with? No, no, I don't. Then I think you need to call the hospital. Okay. I think there's a phone book in the desk drawer there. What is this? What the fuck is this? What? These! I don't know. Where did you get 'em? In your desk! What, are you spying on us? What the hell are you talking about? I'm not doing that! I've no idea where this shit came from! Where'd you get this? Jeff has been investigating us! - Answer me. - I don't know! She found 'em. Maybe she put 'em there! I wanna know where you got these! I've no idea where these came from! We've been looking into your background, Stephen. You've been such a good little boy all your life. How did you get mixed up in all this? ( Telephone rings ) ( Ring ) What? It's cravens, you little shit! Sheriff, I'm a little preoccupied right now. I have something to talk to you about. Get your butt down here. That's going to be impossible because my van is trashed. And you know mommy doesn't let me out after dark. I'm right at your front doorstep, you little twerp! Get down here! How can he be out there? The bridge is gone. This is too weird. ( Bang ) Cravens: Here! ( Bang ) Jeffrey! ( Bang ) It's cravens! ( Bang ) ( Bang ) We got a few things to talk about, boy! ( Banging ) You were a punk as a kid, and you're still a punk! Open up, Jeff! ( Banging ) Open the goddamn door! ( Banging ) If you know what's good for you, you'll open the damn door! You open up this goddamn door right now! I told you to stay out of those woods! They're not gonna just send you back to the loony bin this time. Open the goddamn door! ( Barking ) ( Barking continues ) Jeff! What the fuck, dude? Put the gun down. Put the gun down! Erica. What are you doing? Erica. Aaah! Kim: That's gross! She... she's crippled! Oh, God! You were the last one to see her still alive. The last time I saw her... She was heading up here to see you. I didn't kill her, Stephen. Don't even think it. Kim was up here with me! Well, let me clue you in to something! All right? She didn't commit fucking suicide! One of you... Oh, wait, wait, wait! What about you, huh? What gets you off the goddamn hook? My word! Which is worth exactly shit to me! Where was your little girlfriend this whole time? Oh, for Christ's sake! She can barely get out of bed... It's backwards. Go back to bed, Tristen. The little girl backwards. Erica dancing... Backwards. Everything backwards. What are you talking about? Widdershins. Undo the evil. What the fuck is a widdershin? ( Speaking gibberish ) All right, she's lost her fucking mind. That's it. Backwards. - Backwards! - What? We need to take the tapes, we need to run them backwards. - Why? - I don't know. I think it's gonna help us find out what happened to Erica. Look, this makes no sense! I know it doesn't. Just please do it! ( Tristen murmuring ) ( Keystroking ) See? Nothing. Try the... the... The keystrokes backwards. You know, the fucking command. ( Keystroking ) You see? You guys happy? There's nothing. There's your missing hours. Jeff: This must be when we blacked out. Tristen... Well, she's just... What did you make us do? You're leading us, aren't you? Weren't you watching the fucking screen? No. Get back here! Grab her! Get your hands off me. What did you do, Tristen? Stephen, please tell them to stop. Why aren't you marked like this... Like the rest of us, like Erica? What did you do to Erica? Stephen, why are you letting them do this to me? Why, you killed Erica, didn't you... - Let go of her! - Crazy! Shh, shh, shh! Listen. Just admit it to the camera. We're not gonna take the fall for Erica. Okay? Just admit it. Don't worry, sweetie. We're not gonna hurt you. Not like you hurt the baby. What are you saying? I didn't have anything to do with the baby! The witch kills children! I... Haven't killed anybody! Kim: Bullshit! Look out, Stephen. Tristen, Tristen, just say the words! Just say the words... Aaah! ( Gasps ) Psh! You're all gonna fucking die. You wanna kill me? No. No, I just want to understand. But you can't understand because you're so afraid! Just like the pathetic little children of Blair village, so frightened! Aren't you, little girl? Who are you? She's the witch, man! Ha! Is that what you think... Crazy boy? Tristen! Tristen, talk to me! Stephen... What is it, baby, what is it? Tristen's gone. Get away from him! That's not... How you do it. This is what you want. Tristen, whatever you're doing, don't! I'm not doing anything, honey. It's all up to you! Witch bitch. Why did you kill Erica? ( Sniffs ) ( Sniffing ) I can smell the fear on you. Stay away from me. You wanna kill me? You can't, can you, Kimmy? I will rip your fucking head off! Then fucking do it! Stop it! Stop it. Aw, isn't that what your book's about, Stephen? People just want to see something? You have no balls. You can't do it, can you? You can't do it, you weak, pathetic... Oh, you were the last fucking one with the balls, you little bitch. No! Aaah! No! Aah! ( Choking ) ( Rope creaking ) Aaah! Aah! ( Screaming ) Reporter 1: I'm standing in front of an abandoned broom factory in the tiny Hamlet of Jericho mills just a few Miles from the town of Burkittsville where, just hours ago, police arrested three obsessed movie fans who allegedly committed a series of ritualistic murders after watching last summer's blockbuster movie, "The Blair Witch Project." Reporter 2: That this vehicle... The vehicle you see right behind me... Is owned by one of the suspects, and there is blood evidence linking the suspects to these murders. Reporter 2: Sadly, as has happened so many times before in this country, violent "art" has inspired real-life violence. In this case, it's "The Blair Witch Project." Cravens: I ain't no documentary filmmaker, but I had your videotapes slapped together over at Montgomery college. Sorta tells the whole story. Great. Let's see how fucking insane Tristen was. She practically begged Stephen to push her. Gutting those tourists... How'd you have the stomach for that? Yeah... I don't remember doing that. Let's talk about... Peggy. What? Reporter 4: Apparently one woman was hanged, and the other victim, the cause of death has yet to be determined. Ironically, both women were murdered by their friends. After allegedly participating in a vicious killing spree in the black hills. Reporter 5: The police have not offered a motive, but we're hearing the two slain female killers were apparently involved in witchcraft. And, um... What about the redhead? She was a real pretty girl. She wouldn't put out or something? No, we just found her in the closet. ( Snorts ) It was Tristen. The witch got into her... Fucked with her mind or something. And your girlfriend? Killing her because she had a miscarriage? Whoo-whee! Now, that's harsh. She wrapped the rope around her neck. She was taunting me... Begging me to push her. You're not making a believer out of me, son. It was an accident! ( Sobbing ) I swear to Christ it was an accident! Reporter: Local officials are urging calm and trying to keep curiosity seekers at bay. And as has happened in the past, rumors about a... "Supernatural presence" causing these murders are spreading like wildfire over the Internet. Stephen: W-wait... wait. Wait a... wait a second. Jeff... Jeff... He... he videotaped the whole thing. Watch the tapes. You'll see. Look at the goddamn tapes! Yes, sir. Too much trouble to pay for your beer? I didn't do that. Oh, yeah? Then, um... Who's this? I didn't do that. I didn't do that. That's not how it happened. I didn't do that. That's not how it happened. Stop it. Jeff: Just... just do it! Just admit it to the camera. We're not gonna take the fall for Erica's... Don't worry, we're not gonna hurt you... Not like you hurt the baby. What are you saying? I didn't have anything to do with the baby! The witch kills children! I... Haven't killed anybody! - Bullshit! - No! Tell us the truth. Tell us the truth. Confess. God! Stephen, this is me. What are you talking about? Aah! - Tristen! - Stop it! No! No! Stop! Oh... Jeff: She's the witch, man! Jeff, what are you saying? I'm not the witch, you... Yeah, you are. - What are you saying? - You're the witch. You know what I'm saying, God damn it! Kim: Did you kill Erica? Tristen: Stephen, please... Stephen: You killed Erica. - Confess. - Stephen, stop... - Confess! - Stop it... Say the words. Oh, God, Stephen, don't! Please! No! Fucking witch! This is wrong. This is wrong. Somebody fucked with this tape! Somebody fucked with that tape! That tape is wrong! That's fucking bullshit!
