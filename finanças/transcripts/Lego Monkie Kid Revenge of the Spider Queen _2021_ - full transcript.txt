[EXPLOSION] [GRUNTS] I've barely broken a sweat! Battle's no place to be arrogant. You've got to stay humble. [MK] Says you? [GRUNTS] [MK] Ha! Who's got to be humble now? - [MK GRUNTS] - [SCOFFS] - Still you. - [MK SCREAMING] Oh, boy. [MONKEY KING] Okay! Class commencing. How did I win? Uh... You buried me under a rock slide? Yes! But! Why were you standing in the way of a rock slide? 'Cause you put me there! [MONKEY KING] Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. I got you where I wanted you by putting myself where you wanted me. It's called... Misdirection! - [MK] Seems like a shady lesson. - Too soon, buddy. Ugh! I'm never gonna be as good as you. Pft, not with that attitude! Class dismissed. Yes! I better hit it. I was supposed to meet Mei and the others for the festiv... [YELPS] Hey! [MK] Whoa. [MK] How long have you been preparing this? Come on, it's News Year's, bud. Let's watch the fireworks. Oh, uh, love to! But I really should get back to my... friends. [SIGHS] [MK] Sure. [CROWD CHEERING] [KID 1] Woo-hoo! Happy New Year! [MEI HUMMING] Hmm, I feel like this would be easier if I had fingers. [PIGSY GRUMBLES] Thank you! Great happiness and prosperity this Lunar New Year! Mei, Is it just me, or does Pigsy seem... more stressed than normal? Isn't MK meant to be working today? Yes, Tang, he is! Where is that punk? 'Cause he's sure ain't here! He's training with the Monkey King. He said... New Year, New MK! I'm gonna take my training to a whole new level! - Wow... - [PIGSY GROWLS] Gimme that! "New year, new MK"? Keep going like this, he's gonna be newly unemployed! I mean it! If MK don't get here soon... [SQUEALS] Good cheer and happy new year! Look at all these delicious little goodies! I got enough to share! Ooh! Thanks, Sandy! So, uh... Where's MK? Would you guys please screw around somewhere else? I got a business to run! [PIGSY] So, if you ain't gonna help, go bother some other noodle shop! [OMINOUS MUSIC] [SPIDER QUEEN] Ugh! Yeah, keep laughing! Just wait till you see what I've got cooking. Then, you'll have something to celebrate! Only one hair left... [CHUCKLES] This little piece of that Monkie Kid [SPIDER QUEEN] holds all the power I need! You finished tinkering yet? I have constructed what you asked for. The "delivery systems" are operational. So long as the venom works this time... The venom will work. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [INDISTINCT, SINISTER WHISPERS] [SPLATTERS] [ELECTRICITY BUZZES] No. No, no! [UPSET GROAN] [SPIDER QUEEN] I am the queen! I am meant to rule this world, not hide beneath it! It can't be over... [LADY BONE DEMON] It doesn't have to be. W-Who said that? Show yourself! My apologies. I just... thought I might be of service. Service, huh? [SCOFFS] Who are you? [LADY BONE DEMON] I am merely someone who thinks the great Spider Queen has been absent from her throne for too long. I believe that once you rise, a thing even the celestial host could not achieve will be inevitable... The final Destruction of the Monkey King. Well, don't you have a sweet way of talking? [SPIDER QUEEN] Monkey King tore me from my throne, took everything I had. What makes you think it's so easy? I thought maybe we could use... - [LADY BONE DEMON] this... - [INDISTINCT, SINISTER WHISPERS] My, my, my... I haven't seen one of these for a while. [LADY BONE DEMON] May I? [INDISTINCT, SINISTER WHISPERS] [SPLATS, ELECTRICITY BUZZES] Well, well, well, looks like you have your uses after all. Let's give it a spin? - Wait! No! - [SPIDER QUEEN LAUGHING] I helped you! [TECH MAN] You need me! [TERRIFIED SCREAMS] My Queen. [CHUCKLING] Now, that's more like it. Okay, little miss mystery. What's the catch. I simply wish to see you fulfill your destiny, My Queen. - Well, all right then. - [SPLATTERING] [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] [FESTIVE MUSIC] [MEI] Oh, man! MK's really missing out on all these awesome floats! [GASPS] There's the dragon! There's the Monkey! - Yeah! And there's the spider! - Spider? Pfft! There's no spider in the zodiac. It's probably just an eight-legged rooster, or a... [CLANKS] Spider Queen! [SPIDER QUEEN CHUCKLING] [SPIDER QUEEN] Oh, would you look at that. Everyone here to celebrate... the year of the spider! Go let them know their Queen is back. [CROWD SCREAMING] [TENSE MUSIC] [CLANKING] [CROWD SCREAMING CONTINUES] Happy New Year! Fireworks! Over a millennia and fireworks are still the best thing humans have invented! Mmm. Uh... Am I eating hair right now? It's better not to think about it. [SPITS] [MK] What happened to the fireworks? [CLATTERING] [GASPS] The city! The fireworks! Oh, uh, also people getting hurt, I guess. All right, I'll go take care of business. [YELPS] - [GRUNTS] - Wh... what? Nobody messes with my New Year's. Let's go! [ZAPS] [TENSE MUSIC] - [CROWD SCREAMING] - [CLATTERING] Huh, guess Spider Queen finally crawled out of her cesspit. - Huh? - [SCREAMING CONTINUES] [MAN 1] Whoa! [SHRIEKS] Spiders! No! Get them away from me! Get them away! - [MK WAILING] - [MONKEY KING GRUNTING] Get off, MK! Wait! What are you... Ugh! If you can't handle a little spider... how are you meant to help with that? [MONKEY KING] I'll handle this one, bud. - You just hang tight. - Wait, I... I can still hel... [MK] Help... [THUDS] Oh, Monkey King! Well, isn't this a nice surprise? Finally come out of hiding just to see me? Didn't know you were so desperate for attention, Spider Princess. - It's Spider "Queen", sub human. - [MONKEY KING] Whatever. Thought I'd have to deal with the kid before I got to you. But since you're here... I can destroy you first. [BUZZES] [THUNDERCLAP] [SPIDER QUEEN GRUNTS] [MONKEY KING GRUNTS] [TENSE MUSIC] [THUDS] Give it up, Princess. You're too easy to read! [MYSTERIOUS WHISPERER] Come for me. There! [YELLS] - [INDISTINCT, SINISTER WHISPERS] - [GASPS] [MK] Monkey King! [EXPLOSION] [SPIDER QUEEN CHUCKLES] As easy as a fly... [GRUNTS] [THUDS] Oh, no, a web! You seriously think this can keep me... [SCREAMING IN PAIN] What is this? Finally. After all these years, you're mine! [STRAINING] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [EVIL LAUGH] [GRUNTING IN PAIN] Congratulations on your victory, My Queen. - [INDISTINCT, SINISTER WHISPERS] - My "special" webs will continue to steal Monkey King's power, until he's nothing more than a dried up husk! [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] Nothing and no one will be able to stop me! [SPIDER QUEEN CHUCKLING] Oh, no... [FESTIVE MUSIC] Your food might've permanently damaged my taste buds! Why would you ever sell anything this hot? [CHUCKLES] Dear customer, the spice level was no mistake! I, Red Son, have devised the perfect culinary experience! If you direct your attention down at this chart here, it clearly ranks the spice level from "Very Hot" to "Inferno"! [RED SON] You ordered Very Hot. So... - But it's the lowest one! - Oh! So, I guess I'm meant to make barbecue for peasants! With little, unworthy, disappointing taste buds that shame their fathers? Is that it? Huh? Look, I want to speak to the manager. Fine! Fine! It's your funeral! [GROWLS] Uh, I... I actually didn't need tastebuds anyway. So, thank you for your service and have a prosperous and fulfilling New Year. [SCREAMS] [LOUD THUD] Ugh, Father! You can't just scare away every customer that complains. This is our chance at something great! Great! I am the Demon Bull King. What would you have me be? [DEMON BULL KING] The King of street food? Well... yes? I mean, after your recent humiliating defeat, I thought a fresh start was exactly what we needed. Just you and me working together, father and son! No evil plans, no... talking bones... [SNARLS] Heh, sorry, fresh wound. [DEMON BULL KING] Enough! I may have failed as a conqueror, but I will not be made a fool! - [LOUD THUD] - [RED SON GASPS] Um... Father! Father! Hmm? [CHUCKLES] Sorry, Father. I will come back! What? What is this? Who dares? [SPIDER QUEEN LAUGHING] Why, me, of course... Argh... I have truly fallen if one such as you can best me. The "would-be" Queen of Spiders. Ain't nothing "would-be" about it. I am the Spider Queen! And you? Nothing but a battery for my mech. [CHUCKLES] Look around, handsome. You're not the only prize I snapped up. [SPIDER QUEEN] Every one of them is just dying to give me their power. - Princess Iron Fan? - Aww, Don't worry. Haven't found your wifey. Yet... I did manage to track down an old friend of yours. 'Sup Bull King? You too, huh? [CHUCKLES] Monkey King! [TECH SPIDER] My Queen! - I have news regarding Red... - [CLEARS THROAT] My Queen, I have news regarding Red Son. [GROWLS] Useless offspring. Mm-hmm, go on. He actually... Er, got away. I didn't doubt him for a second. You will never catch him! - Urgh! Find him! Now! - [BULL KING LAUGHS] - Yes, My Queen. - [DOOR SLAMS] - [INDISTINCT, SINISTER WHISPERS] - [LADY BONE DEMON] My Queen, what of the Monkey King's protege? Perhaps he should join his master? [HATEFUL GRUNT] Yeah, and the boy, too. I can't have these problematic children running around causing me problems! [CROWD SCREAMING] [TANG] Ahh! Let's go, let's go, let's go! What about MK? The kid's with Monkey King, he's safer than anyone. Try turning us into spiders when we're in the middle of the O... cean! [LIGHTNING STRIKES] Ugh... Sandy? - Uh, we gotta get going soon! - Come on, come on! Don't do this to me! [GASPS] I don't usually have this problem! [SANDY CHUCKLES] Honest! We're all gonna die. [ENGINE SPEEDING UP] Target acquired. [BEEPS] [CLANKING] [LAUGHING] [RED SON GASPS] [INDISTINCT, SINISTER WHISPERS] [HUNTER SPIDER] Now, now, my pets... Be patient! Daddy's gonna have his fun. - Uh, Sandy? - Get us out of here! Uh, working on it! Uh... Uhm... Here? Uh! There! [HUNTER SPIDER] What's the rush? It's not so bad, if you go quietly. The transition will be almost painless! We can handle one of her lackeys! Two of her lackeys? Oh, boy... [CHAIN BREAKS] [YELPS] Guys! You're okay! I thought you'd been turned into gross spider thingies! They're everywhere! [GASPS] I can still feel them crawling all over me! - Kid, focus! - [SIGHS] [MK] Yep, working on it! We've found the Monkey King's apprentice exactly where you said he'd be. Oh, no. [PANTS] [TENSE MUSIC] Sandy! It's now or never, old buddy! Ah! Found it! [CLICKS] Uh... Sandy? Give it a minute! [EXPLOSION] He can't escape! Come on! Whoa! So, what do you guys think? Been saving her for a rainy day. Real cool, Sandy. - It's awesome for taking in... - [CAMERA CLICKS] the horrifying vistas. [MK] Spider Queen captured Monkey King. - What! - That's not possible! [MK] Yeah. Her and this weird... skeleton thing. She got him! And I... I... didn't... I didn't even try to help... He lost and then... [MEI] It's okay, MK. We got this. We can beat her. She beat the Monkey King, Mei! We don't got this! I'm sorry. I just... I don't know what to do. Kid, no one ever does. Not really. But we're going to figure this out. Together. [SANDY] That's right, little man... Just as soon as we deal with that! [SCREAMS] Incoming! - [EXPLOSION] - [SCREAMING CONTINUES] [RED SON COUGHS] - Red Son? - What? - Get him! - [RED SON] No! Get off me, you filthy peasants! What are you doing here, Red Son? Yeah, spill! You one of the Spider Queen's henchmen now, huh? Henchmen? [SCREAMS] Not that any of you would care... [RED SON] but my father was captured by that eight-legged freak! So, if you'll excuse me, I'll just steal this ship and be on my way. Wait, what? That's not... [GRUNTS] Fine. Will you let me steal your ship so I can go save my father, and also the world, from this spider menace? Please. Are you serious? - You can't steal the ship! - Hmm, he's pretty convincing... [RED SON] Well, I can't use mine, it's busted! [EXHALES SHARPLY] But one thing I do have... is this. [RED SON] Spider Queen's venom. It's turned everyone into her slaves, but I can make an antidote. However, I'll need supplies. And the only place to get them is... [GASPS] Space? No, you noodle brain! The Celestial Realm! The Celestial Realm? [TANG STAMMERS] The realm of heavenly deities and immortal beings? [RED SON] Sure. So, if you get to Spa... uh, the Celestial Realm, you can fix... all of this? Kid, you're not really considering this, are you? - Well... Uh... - [BOTH] What? MK, are you serious? It's Red... [SPLUTTERING]...Boy! He's literally a demon! [RED SON] Oh! Pretty rich coming from Pig Man and the blue thing! - [MEI] Don't you dare talk... - [SANDY] Hey! What'd I do? [MEI]...about my friends like that! [RED SON] Not even gonna start on you, dragon girl! - Let's help him. - [ALL] Huh? What other choice do we have? Look, the spider Queen won't see this coming. It's the best plan we've got. So, I say... let's help a demon rob the Celestial Realm! [AUSPICIOUS MUSIC] [SCRATCHES] [RED SON] Hmm. So, how exactly does this work? Ugh, if I tried to explain mystical inter-dimensional travel to a bunch of peasants, it'd melt your brains! We don't have any other option. - We have to trust him. - [RED SON CHUCKLES] Great speech, noodle boy! Super motivational! [INHALES DEEPLY] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] Uh, we are sure mortals can travel to the Celestial Realm, yes? Of course, they can! Safely? Sure... Probably. [ALL] Probably? [SCREAMING] I did say it'd melt your brains. [GASPS] Whoa! [TANG SIGHS IN AWE] [TANG] The Celestial Realm. [PIGSY] So, some special pills, a fancy peach, and a furnace? Where we gonna find these things? [GASPS] Red Boy doesn't know! Wa... I know they're somewhere! I'm a demon! It's not like I've been here before! [SIGHS, CLEARS THROAT] Well, in the legend, Monkey King stole... [SANDY] Stole? That's not the Monkey King I know! [TANG] Borrowed the peaches of immortality from the heavenly orchard. So, unless they did the sensible thing and moved them, they'll still be there! The pills of the great master, Lao Tsu. Monkey King stole... [CHUCKLES] Borrowed some of those too. They must be in Lao Tsu's alchemy lab! [RED SON] And what about the furnace? I can't make anything without that. It could be there in the lab, but my guess is it will be... In the Jade Emperor's throne room! - Wait what? - Huh? All right, then! I'll be off to grab that peach. - Toodles! - What? Hey! Like we'd just let you wander off on your own! [YELPS, GASPS] You just wait here like an obedient little pup... [SCREAMS] I'm keeping you where I can see you. I'll go for the pills. Er... They're just regular looking pills, right? Round, kinda shaped like... pills? You know, like normal pills? I'll better come too. [MK] And I'll get the furnace. On your own? I dunno if that's good idea. The throne room's too well guarded! [GASPS, GRUNTS] - Huh? - You guys get the items, [SANDY] and get back here as fast as you can. I'll stay here and knock some sense into the engines! [TENSE MUSIC] [HEAVY BREATHING] [TENSE MUSIC CONTINUES] [METAL CLANKING] [SANDY CHUCKLES] I'm helping! What you got there, Mo? Some kinda ominously beeping spider-themed tracker? [EXPLODES] Whoa... I'm sure it's fine. - [RAPID BEEPING] - [GROWLS] [MK] Wow. Guess this is the Throne room. [SNARLS] [MK] Whoa! I knew this place was gonna be big but... Wow! [SHARP EXHALES] There it is! Well, that was easy! [CHUCKLES] [MONSTER DOGS SNARLING] [MK] Uh... eh... Nice, giant... monster dogs? - [MONSTER DOGS GROWLING] - [SCREAMS] [HEAVY BREATHING, YELPING] [THUDS, GRANTS] - Huh? Wait! - [CLATTERS] No, no, no, no, no! - [CLANKING] - [GROWLS] - [TRANQUIL MUSIC] - [CROWD LAUGHING] [SQUEAKING FOOTSTEPS] So, heard you helped MK beat your dad. That was one time! - [CHUCKLES] - My father, the great Demon Bull King... was... [RED SON] not himself. Ugh! But in no other instance would I ever assist that sorry excuse for a hero! But you're totally assisting right now! [GASP] You are a hero! Huh? Red Son! Red Son, hero of the city! Saving Dads! - Saving the World! - [THUDS] Saving spicy barbecue one bite at a time. Buy two, get one free. Would you give me that! [BLASTS] Let's just get this peach and... Mei and Red Son, Heroes on a quest! [CHUCKLES] Okay, le-go! I just decided... [RED SON] She's next on my hit list. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Every item in this room is brimming with untold, dangerous power! - [GLASS SHATTERS] - Tang! Stop screwing around! Hmm. Lao Tsu's pills. If I know anything about the legends, they won't be easy to find. [PIGSY] Is this them? [SCREAMING WITH AWE] That's them! [COUGHS, CLEARS THROAT] Yes. - Great! Let's get going. - [HUNTER SPIDER LAUGHS WICKEDLY] What's the rush, little piglet? [BOTH SCREAM] [LAUGHS WICKEDLY] There was no way I could do this. I can't do anything on my own. [AUSPICIOUS MUSIC] Monkey King! I knew you'd... Oh, perfect, perfect! Just who I need! Useless MK! What have you got to say, huh? - That's not how mirrors work. - [SPLUTTERING] [MK] Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm going crazy! Yep! Ugh! Stop that! Listen! Every time we get in trouble, we turn to Monkey King, or our friends or someone! They tell us a story and we find that smidge of motivation we need. Well... [USELESS MK] now, we're on our own! It's just... you. [MEI] Hey! Remember when you went crazy racing for a fake one of these things? I remember when you wrecked my car! [MEI] Eh, we wreck a lot of stuff. Oh. Well, that was easy. [GASPS] Well, well. You and your little girlfriend are coming with me. - His... - Girlfriend? - Flaming fist of dignity! - Aw! You got me in my favorite eye! [BOTH SCREAM] Hey! Get back here with that stone fruit!! [RED SON] Let me down! [MEI] There's no time! Hmm... [SNIFFS, CHUCKLES] [GROWLS] Here, Piggy, Piggy... Oh, We gotta do something. Huh? Hmm. [TANG] Hmm. Ha! [HUNTER SPIDER] There you are! [EVIL LAUGH] Ho-ho! You're going down. [GROWLS, GRUNTS] Huh? [BOTTLE BREAKS] - [CHUCKLES] - [BOTH] Huh? [GROANS] Ahh, I... I thought it was going to turn him into a little ducky! Ugh! [PIGSY] Come on! Let's get outta here! [THUDS, HEAVY BREATHING] [USELESS MK] Hey! Do you know, uh... Monkey King was trapped in here once, too? Yeah, difference is... he was thrown in. And I... jumped! True... But know what he did? He stuck it out. Found a way out. Ended up getting his golden eyes of truth, too! Well, I'm not the Monkey King, okay? [USELESS MK] You're right. You're the Monkie Kid! You've gotta figure out your own way to win. So, do it. [AUSPICIOUS MUSIC] [GASPS] Here... comes... Monkie Kid! [METAL CLANKS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MK GRUNTS] [THUDS] [SWOOSHES] [MK] Ah! Sorry! [PANTING] Uh, I'll bring it back when we're done saving the world! Honest! Promise! Totally going to do it! K-bye! [PIGSY] Sandy! [PANTING] [GASPS] Pigsy! Tangy! You got the pills! Uh-huh, we also have spiders! They followed us here! Oh, where are the others? Sandy! Start the engines! It's time to go! What about MK? [MK] Sandy! Start... the... drone! [GRUNTS] [ENGINE STARTS] [LEAPING EFFORT] What are you doing? I could have made it! Aww, Sure you could, buddy. Huh? [SCREAMING] [MK] Yeah! [GROWLS] The queen ain't going to be happy about this. [GROWLING] Uh... Nice monster doggy? [HUNTSMAN 1] No, no, no, no, no. No! - [HUNTSMEN SCREAM] - [BOTH CRASH] [TANG] So, uh... what now? We find a place to lie low, make the antidote, and save everyone. Ugh, you're back to your disgustingly, enthusiastic self. What happened? I got a new power. [MK] The power... Huh? ...of self-reflection! - Ooh... - Whoa! What? [GROANS] So, where we headed? [MK] Set a course... for Flower Fruit Mountain! [MONKEY KING GROANS] What do you think, Big Guy? Enjoying the party? [SCOFFS] She would never have subdued me had you not given her the power she needed! Or it's just that she captured me first... - 'cause I'm her favorite! - [ROARS] [GRUNTS] [SPIDER QUEEN SIGHS] [SPIDER QUEEN LAUGHS EVILLY] My Queen, it seems the demon boy and the Monkey King's protege are working together. So? What can they do? This city is mine! - [CHUCKLING] - Perhaps you should... Enough! I don't need you coming in here being a party pooper. You know what we need to do? Celebrate! Ring in the year of the spider in style! As you wish... [CHUCKLING WICKEDLY] I, Red Son, will bind the powers of the celestial artifacts with the Spider Queen's own venom, save my father, and reforge the world as I see fit. [LAUGHING WICKEDLY] - Red Son, that was amazing. - Such a good hero speech. Villain speech! And perhaps my best of all time! Okay! So what do we do now, guy? We do nothing! I add the ingredients in a precise order you wouldn't understand. Uh, there's only two more ingredients, Red Boy. - And I already chucked them in. - What? You're welcome! [ALL COUGHING] Ooh, I think it worked! [MK] All right! [TENSE MUSIC] Time to take the fight back to the Spider Queen and end this nightmare once and for all! How? Those spider people aren't just going to line up for a sip. And even if they did, are we forgetting about Spider Queen? She defeated the Monkey King! [TANG] How are you... We'll find a way. We always do. Well, I might have an idea. [GRUNTS CONFIDENTLY] [VICTORIOUS MUSIC] Oh, yeah! With this... We might have a chance! [VICTORIOUS MUSIC CONTINUES] [SWOOSHES] [FIREWORKS CRACKLING] [SPIDER QUEEN LAUGHING WICKEDLY] Oh! Here comes the spider float! And the Spider dancers! This is how you rule the world. [CHUCKLES] What is that? I don't know... It's not on the approved parade schedule! [METAL CLANKING] [ACTION MUSIC] [ALL GRUNTING] If it isn't Spider Queen, throwing herself a party. Prepare to meet your doom! [LAUGHS MANIACALLY] - Now, that's a hero speech! - Wow, MK, you're handling your spider phobia so well! I'm internalizing a lot of stuff right now. Release the antidote! - [ACTION MUSIC CONTINUES] - [METAL CLICKING] [GASPS] What? No! - Oh, my freedom! - I'm free! It's working! Let's finish this! [ALL GRUNTING] [VICTORIOUS MUSIC] Your reign of horror is... over... [LAUGHS WICKEDLY] Oh, Monkie Boy! You're nothing without your master. There's nothing that can stop me. Nothing! [SPIDER QUEEN ROARS] [GRUNTS] [MACHINE POWERING UP] [GASPS] [ACTION MUSIC] [MK GRUNTS] [POWERING UP] [GASPS IN SURPRISE] [EXPLOSION] - [MEI] MK! - [MK GROANS IN PAIN] [LAUGHING WICKEDLY] [RED SON GRUNTS] [SPIDER QUEEN] Ooh! [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] [CRACKLING] It's a shame really... You being trapped here, [MONKEY KING] there's no one to protect poor little Princess Iron Fan... [GRUNTS] My wife doesn't need protecting! [DEMON BULL KING] She will decimate all in her way! Oh, yeah? How about your half-baked son? Spider Queen's gonna eat him alive! [MONKEY KING] All because you were too weak! [GRUNTING EFFORTLY] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] Ha! It worked! Excellent! Whoa... [THUDS, ROARS] [MONKEY KING GRUNTS] Buddy! I was just getting you angry so you could... I know what you were doing, Simian! [RIPS] Wait, where are you going? To find my half-baked so... Son! [DEMON BULL KING GRUNTS] I've honestly missed that guy. So, you thought you had all the pieces right where you wanted them? There are so many moves I have yet to play. You should have stayed buried. [ROARS] [EXPLOSION] [LADY BONE DEMON] I will rip the memory of you from this world... [GASPS] [LADY BONE DEMON HISSES] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [MK SCREAMS] [MONKEY KING GRUNTING] [SPIDER QUEEN] Hmm!

I'm your biggest fan! Hey, Daddy Bull King! Your baby Red Boy did real good hero work today! Argh! No, no! For the last time, I am not a hero! - Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! - Father, let's... never tell Mother anything that happened today? Agreed. Come along, son. S... Son?
