- Hi! - Hi all! - Hi! - We'll turn on the car heater, OK? - This one's a bit lighter. Look! - Or this? It's darker. - If we combine them... - Both are lovely, ladies. Even if he's autistic, it's demagogy, right? People eat that stuff up. It's collective guilt-tripping. Pointless. He's in high school. He knows nothing about market economy. - Great that you arrived! - Why is it good if it's shit for me? It's great to see so many of you! Hopefully the weather will be nicer on Matyi's birthday. But you should have more kids too. Ági, for instance... Baptisms are great. You can get drunk before noon. I'm still nursing, but Tomi says one is okay. Thanks, Ági, for replacing Adél as godmother so last minute. You're committed for life now. We'd like gold watches for his graduation. You know. Eat, drink! There are dips. Just don't get dip on the carpet 'cause it cost the same as Tomi's car. Never mind, I'll clean it anyway. Well, chin-chin! - Éva looks so good! - Hi, Mom. They bought some fancy fitness machine. That's good. - Couldn't you leave sooner? - I was on the night shift. I don't get it. You're always filling in for others. At least hold him. Mmm, how nice. - Can you take down your hair? - It's really greasy. Oh, Adél! Éva can keep clean even with a baby. Hold him, please. I need to pee. Come, darling, come. Ice Cream Can Be Dangerous - Hi! - Hi! - Not in there! - It says this locks in the aroma... That's it? Sure? Done? - Bye, guys! - Thanks, Marcsi! Who was that English person? - Give me a slice? - You know, the Norwegians. Oh yeah! The ones we're mad at? Well... Weird how they can't decide for weeks, y'know? Maybe they've already decided, but they're scared to say? No way! Why else would that Viking be their HR? - Maybe I'll be living abroad next year? - I don't want to root against you. - What's with this hot dog? - It's Jalapeño. Not bad. Come in from behind. I'm here at the fire. OK, but lure them in then. Heal! Heal! My mana's almost gone! Wait a sec! Hello? I called them. They said it's not their fault. Whose is it then? Tomi says just order a new one. I wasted E143 on a broken swing. It was that much? Yeah, and you left your bag here. What bag? Brown, fake leather. Will you pop by for it? I'm on duty after my patients. Why take on so many? Cancel and come over! - Can't Tomi drop it off? - You never come see us. Éva, can't Tomi drop it off? Well, I don't wanna bother him with stupid things. Matyi's crying, I gotta go 'cause I'll go crazy. - Kisses. - Bye. You here, Farkas? Turn right. The destination is to your right. You have arrived. Hello! Good day! Adél? - Adél Erdős. - Ákos. - I'm looking for Tamás. - I recognized you. It wasn't that hard though. Tamás went back to the office. His wife left something for me. Yes, he said you'd be coming. It's in the canteen. - Thank you. - No problem. - Which way is it? - I'll walk you. Which of you was born first? - Me. - I thought so. You seem older. Sorry, I have to answer this. Sure. Bye! My blood pressure's been 170 since your text. - You want some? - Stop eating that shit! Well, what is it? - I got the job. - I'm so happy for you! We'll get drunk on the weekend. - I gotta go. - Are you on duty? - You're happy, right?! - Sure! Yeah, I can see that. Hi. You'll spend Christmas abroad? And what about Grandma's flat? We'll rent it out quick, and I'll stay with Mom. Till I leave. A few days. I don't wanna deal with real estate agents. What agents? We don't need them. You know how hard it is to rent out a flat? Someone's gotta take pictures, you gotta post the ad, show the place to people, and whatever else... And who knows who you let into the flat. - Thanks. - Thanks very much. Jesus, I'll do it myself then. Mom needs that extra money. Tax free. Tomi's cousin is looking for a place. Then ask her. But maybe she doesn't want to live in a slum. Hey! I'm here. Gotta go. - Bye. - Bye. - Hello. - Hey! - Something wrong? - Nope. I'm just here to see you. Wanna get a coffee? Oops. - But you recognize me, right? - This isn't a break. I'm working. Let's wait a moment. - Well? - Just a moment! - What is it? - Hello? I said I'm with patients. Anything wrong? - Where are you? - I just said. I'm working. Something wrong? Never mind, I wanted to talk, but you're so irritated. Some other time. Bye. You need to have an ultrasound. - Which way is it? - End of the hall, to the right. No need to knock. Good-bye! Hello! I think we can make it in 2 rounds. It's not much. OK. Tomi will help, okay? Hey, Tomi's employee asked for your number. Maybe he needs an X-ray. What? Who did you meet? Nobody, what do I know? Anyway, I said you don't play favorites. Yeah. We'll come for you in the morning, okay? Kisses. Thanks! Kisses. Shit. Fucking hell. Evie, honey, leave it, I'll do it. - Will you help with the clothes? - Did you go to acupuncture? - Are you kidding? For that price? - But I told you we'd pay for it. Please don't throw plastic in the trash. The recycling's over here. This fridge is awful. You're bending over for nothing. The fridge is fine. Your father bought it. And who needs a freezer? Next week we'll pick one out at MediaMarkt. Did you sign up for physiotherapy? You need to be able to bend over. You need to strengthen muscles. - That's for old ladies. - And people with pain. You father would be 63 years old today. So please stop bitching. A fridge won't fix your spine. - Then I shouldn't get one? - Tomi! We need the fridge! Mom, would you exercise with me? I'm in bad shape too. And the dog is coughing. I don't know why. Maybe because the bathroom is moldy. Go! She's a nervous wreck already. Tomi, would you have a look at the bathroom? I can't lean over to look behind the bathtub. Sure, I'll have a look. It sucks that you're leaving. How I hated those pigtails. You asked for those pigtails. Why did you call me last time? When? When you were crying. I wasn't crying. Fine, when you weren't crying then. Are you trying to pick a fight? - I just asked how you are. - That's not what you asked! Fucking whatever. - I'm so wrinkly. - It suits you. It suits me? Don't go, my chickadee. But you still have a nice voice. You could be really famous now. Oh, no. - You're totally in fashion! - On Megastar! Sweetheart, how are you doing anyway? That's great! Pippi, you are such a sweet little doggy! - Sweetie. - Sweetie. And you're beautiful, just like your owner. - Ildikó, dear, did you get a haircut? - Can you tell? It's been such a long time! Which one are you? Adél! - You know, Éva lives on Széchenyi Hill. - Adél? Goodnight! I bought a fresh roll for tomorrow. Don't forget it! Next time I'll show her this finger of mine. You think it's normal that it's so crooked? Let's go on the quest, you know, with the two Bosses in the woods who reanimate each other and they gotta be killed at once. And they come in real fast. You know. And then there's that field with those prickly flowers. Crane-man Ákos: Are you awake? - OK, he's getting it. We need to get out of here. Heal! Is this some doctor thing? You said you were awake. I was waiting for your answer. Where are we going? I don't know. Are you hungry? I am. The patient is No.1, 'cause what if my diagnosis is wrong? Or if the patient gets the wrong treatment and they could have been saved. Do you like being a crane operator? Sure, I love it. Don't you want to do anything else? I don't know. Did you know that in Norway a bunch of foresters are committing suicide? Because of wood industry corporations. They destroy the forests. You got any change? - Hello? - It's Adél. Where were you yesterday? Sorry. Farkas! He was still playing in secret at 2AM. I don't know what to do. I turn the WiFi off, and he plugs it back in. - You want coffee? - Please. - You didn't sleep again? - Sure, I did. I see. Well? So? I don't know. - Éva called me, crying. - That's totally normal. I was crying non-stop when I nursed Farkas. Laci slept on the couch 3x a week. That's completely normal. That's marriage. Shit. This is different. They're acting really weird. Tamás is getting Mom a fridge for E860. And Éva's worried eco-diapers cost too much. - Eco-diapers are worthless crap. - Farkas! - They really are. - I'm definitely not having kids. Until you fall in love and will want them. And if Hungary runs out of drinking water? Then you'll buy bottled. Hm? Goodbye party on Saturday then? I washed the curtains. The paramedics will pop over too, if they're not too busy. Maybe I'll bring a guest. - Adél looks so good in this picture! - And I wasn't there then? Yes, you look sweet too. A piece of ceiling crashed onto a patient's bed in the ward. No way! - Like a zombie attack! - Don't say things like that! It was hardcore. Luckily, the patient went out to piss. But seriously, guys, think about it! So, if he hadn't gotten up to piss... - If he hadn't drunk his apple juice... - Oh! Right? Then he'd be dead. It's not fate though. The wall is crumbling. Is that him? No. - Who is HIM? - I'm not telling. - Come on! - Adél is a nervous wreck anyway! Hi. You were switched off. I was worried. I got my period for the first time since the baby. I'm totally out of it. - Oh! I don't have my period. - Now this will make me cry too. Our cycles were always in synch. Do you believe in fate? - What? - Things happen for a reason. You only understand later. Ah... I dunno. I gotta go. Everyone's waiting. Who is? The party. You know, at Vilma's. She didn't even tell me! I dunno. You must not be Facebook friends. Come over if you want. Nah. Where would I put Matyi? Fine. I'll call you back. No, you won't. Kisses. Bye. - I can't believe you made it! - Hi, Vilma! - Hey! Come on in in, guys! - Hey, Vilmuska! - Where's the patient? - Everyone's here! Hello, hello! All dolled up! Does the party need intensive care? - It's wild. C'mere! - A wild party. Look how pretty Madam Doctor is! - Let's drop the formality. - Nice ass, Doc! - Fuck, man! Don't be rude! - Sorry, I was just kidding. Don't worry! We won't eat him alive. That blue thing looks smashing on you. Here's Ákos! Hello! - Ákos. - Vilma. Hey! We've been waiting for you. Leave them. Don't! Okay, take them off then. Come in! Guys! A new guest! Ákos. Ákos - Everyone. Tibi, Zsolti, Nelli. Marcsi, Erika, and Kati, and you know Adél. - Hey guys! - Hi! We always offer a welcome drink! Well, uh... I don't drink alcohol. No getting out of it! - I just won't drink it. - Well, then I'll drink it. - How come you don't drink? - Alcohol doesn't interest me. - It's all that interests me! Prosit! - To your health! That's all yours then! - Yummy. - Who wants to play a game? Me! Me! So, it's sheriffs against bandits and they kill each other. Some cards let you rob 1 person, others let you rob everyone. Sounds like Hungary. Every card has a meaning. The symbols are explained. You keep that. We have to leave now. - Bye, Doc! - Bye, see you! - Have a nice trip, Doc! - Thank you! - Thanks for the crêpes! - Leave the door open! - Sure. Enjoy the party! - Bye! It's such a complex game that... We'll get into it and hate each other. Yeah. Erika, you got so mad last time, you went home. - Cause I don't play with cheaters. - Sounds like a great game. - Hello! - I brought prosecco. Where's the fridge? - Hey! - Come on in! - Hello! - Hello! - I came to join the party. - Hi! - Hi, I'm Éva. - We've already met. You and your husband dropped in to see Doc at Christmas. - Don't you need to nurse? - My milk dried up. Hello. It's been a while. Don't be so formal! Who wants beer? - Me! - Yes, I do! What are these cards? Adél! What's the name of your winning character? Pedro Ramirez. His specialty is that he gets to draw from the tossed cards. It's pointless, 'cause everyone can see, but Adél can always win with him. Look, Adél! That's what Dad looked like. Show me. Same moustache and eyebrows. The old man must have been really severe. It's too long to explain. So just play. Come on! Can I come up? Nah. Didn't you have a good time tonight? I've never even written a love letter. Well, you'll write what's up, and I will too, and then we'll know. What the fuck? I'll laugh if you run to the airport and beg me to stay. I won't do that. I think it's fucking great that you're leaving. Thanks a lot. Don't act like I'm your girlfriend. That's not what I meant. - Your car keys! - Goodnight! - You left your car keys. - What? Crane (Lifting Machine) Tower Crane Hi. I can talk now. What's up? Look who's keeping secrets! I'm not keeping secrets. What is it? If I don't go, I don't find out about Ákos? There's nothing to know. It's nothing. Come over on the weekend! Look, I gotta go. We'll talk about this later, OK? Friday? - I'm leaving on Monday. - Bring Ákos too, if you like. Alright, okay. Kisses. Who will I smoke with if you leave? Erika. - What are you doing here? - Isn't Éva here? Why would she be? - I gotta run. Kisses. - Bye. Nelli and the others friended me on Facebook. I think they really like you. I'm sorry. Can't they fire you for this? Yeah. I'm never getting down from here. You can't park here. - Shall I move? - No, let's go. We're late. Maybe we should buy some wine. Look! I bought this tub of ice cream. - Let's not give that to them. - Relax! I'm relaxed. I couldn't give a shit about tonight. - Hi! - Hi! - Come in! - So great that you're here! Matyi's asleep, so let's keep it down. Éva, you too. This is for dessert, maybe... - The flat is gorgeous. - Thank you! - Éva decorated it. - Thanks! Have you heard of the ice cream mafia? They sell ice cream mix and say it's fancy-shmancy artisanal stuff. - But it's gotta have milk in it at least. - Creamed fake lard. Your hair is so pretty! Are you using the vegan shampoo I got you? I think so. - This table is really great! - Never mind the artificial ingredients! Let's be reckless! - Shouldn't we have the ice cream later? - I'll be right back. Listen, I think she has post-partum depression. Do you know a good expert she can see? I don't want to send her to a state psychologist. Well... Ákos! Are you going out to Norway too? Who will be our crane man if you leave us? - Actually, we haven't yet... - I'll visit her, sure. I just burned my hand a bit. It doesn't hurt. - Did you come by car? - Yes. Do you want to sleep over? Well... I'll get the soup. Okay? Have a seat. OK, my hand's really starting to hurt now. Funny how we haven't visited each other yet. Yes. Maybe it's better this way. You leave, and I'd just sob all day, and not do anything except... watch Netflix. I need to pee. You're lovely even when you cry. - I'm not crying. - Hey. Wipe your face. I'll be right back. Everything okay? Sure. Can I ask something? Go ahead. But you'll be mad. That's okay. But, how to say it? Whatever is the simplest. - Would you get in? - I don't want to. They'll crash into me. Then keep driving! You hate sleeping with me this much? Do I stink? - Won't you tell me what's wrong? - Forget it. Okay, take those off. Yes. Okay. Now the other. Will you take me home? Your place or mine? - Whichever. - Sure. I dreamt that vines grew out from under the bed, overrunning the nursery. I saw the vines coming from me. I felt my roots growing. I wish there was nothing here. Only the trees. Nah, I'd be fucking scared. We can wait another half hour. Thank God Father Gáspár is a nice guy. - Let's choose a godmother. - Adél. - Someone who's actually here? - Hasn't she called yet? She deliberately ignores my calls. Don't be silly, Mom. Is there a bathroom? Through the mysterious power of this blessed water, mercifully grant the rebirth of the spirit to your servant Mátyás, whom we have brought to you for christening in order that he might have eternal life, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. - Amen! - Amen! Receive the light! I always considered my life complete, and then... I met Éva. I don't even know what to say. I didn't know such love existed. I'm so happy to have you two. You should all have families too, 'cause it's fucking great! Thanks for being here. Huge kudos to Ági for filling in as godmother. You're committed for life now. Eat, drink! Mind the carpet. - It cost as much as my car. - But which car? If you spill something, no prob! Éva will clean it! Cheers, cheers. Hello! I wished you'd have arrived in time. Sure, but I'm sleeping with my eyes open these days. I'll grab a bite. What time is it? Almost midnight. - Were you nursing? - No. No. Go back to sleep. What were you doing? Taking a bath. For two hours? I was just thinking. - Could you turn it off? - What were you thinking about? Nothing interesting. Sleep! You know I hate this. Nothing. I was just thinking that... I want to finish school. That's what you were thinking about? You hated that school. But I might like it this time. You're right. - Do you want to try? - Uh-huh. - But tell me if it hurts. - It won't. I dreamt that this ancient pediatrician came over. She can't see. Seems unqualified. She asked the baby's name, but we forgot he was Matyi so we said Dezső. And I was crying for some reason. I don't remember why. I have to go to the office. - Can we eat together? - Well, kisses! If I reserve a table for 8PM, will you arrive by then? - You can barely get a table on Friday. - I'm in meetings all afternoon. Then I'll book it for 8 and you'll text if something comes up. Can I close the door? Kisses then! - Hello! - Hi! I left your bag in the canteen. You'll find it. Can't you drop it off? It'll get stolen. No. Nobody will steal it. Does it matter when I go? Is there always someone there? I'll call you back. I'm here! I'm here! It's okay! It's okay, it's okay! - What's wrong with it? - I don't know. Let me see! Show me! - It's okay, I'm here. - The battery is dead. What can we do? - Spare key? - Uhh... - I think in the glove compartment. - Fuck! I'll call Tamás. Okay! - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Ooookay. Okay. Wait a while before you drive. Okay. Poor thing. It picked a bad spot to grow. Unfortunately, it has to be cut down. Look, these leaves, for example, are red because this soil is chalky and they don't get enough nutrients. And autumn arrives earlier for them. Really? - I wish there were woods here. - Yeah, that would be nice. - Will you two be okay? - Uh-huh, sure. Okay. Hi, Tree. Hi. Can you hear me? Sure. Do you love me? Sure. Won't you be cold in that? I think the dinner went well. I hope Tomi's investors really invest. Uh-huh. And I need to rent out the apartment. Tomi's cousin is looking for a place. Really? Isn't she with her boyfriend? - They broke up, so it's pretty urgent. - Fine by me. Will you ask, please? I'm here. Gotta go. Bye. Kisses. - What did I mess up this time? - Please, don't! Don't. Tell me what I did, so next time I... Tell me what I did, so next time I won't do it. How do I even explain? What's there to explain? You're ridiculous, taking pictures of food like you're 15. - Excuse me? - Really. It's embarrassing for me. - I have secondhand shame... - I was super polite! - Can we talk about this at home? - What's wrong with here? Please... Pull over! Please, Tomi! I don't like when you drive like this. Do you want to? Just smash this window too if you don't have keys. - I couldn't help it. - Fuck, Éva, get out! Hello? Hello! What is it?! Éva! Where are you? I said I'm with patients! Anything wrong? OK. I have to work. I'm hanging up. Bye! I'm an ass, really. Yeah. Don't be mad. Éva! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! Éva, what's this music? It's a Mongolian battle song. They say: if the enemy comes, we'll kill them. It's so aggressive. Matyi loves it. Calm down, Matyi, dear. Sleep, Matyi, honey. Come on, come. You shouldn't listen to aggressive music in the car. How did you ever manage the two of us? Did you ever sleep? The baby should listen to children's songs. I saw a washing machine for E230. Prices these days are crazy! It's probably the brand. Where was it? And the dog's coughing. I don't know why. Maybe it's because the bathroom is moldy. I opened the windows... Mom, were you ever frightened by Dad? - Éva! - Go on! She's a nervous wreck as it is. - Watch Matyi till then? - Sure, sure! Do you need this? There's no space for my stuff. It sucks that you're leaving. Why did you call me last time? When you were crying. I wasn't crying. You're tired. Sure, I'm tired. I have a kid. Others work 8 hours and then raise kids too. Not everybody can be a doctor. Nobody's asking you to be one. Go, Moms! Together we can do anything! Barbi? - Hello! - Hello. Can I have a look? - How old is he? - Four months. - Where are yours? - Oh, my husband is in home office. Listen! I brought frozen. But I brought fresh too. But I only have 800ml of fresh now. - Thanks. I wired you the money. - Well, thank you. There and... I think that's it. If you need more call me, OK? I need to pump all the time, even at work. Call anytime, okay? Bye! - Hello! - I can't hear you. What is it? Can't you move off a bit? Where are you? At Vilma's. We're celebrating Norway. I'll call you back, okay? - You didn't even tell me this morning. - I probably forgot. I gotta go. Kisses! Okay. Kiss! Kiss. Hello! - Hey! - Hi. I'm Adél's sister. - Could you get her, please? - Sure! Adél! Hello. What are you doing here? Do you believe in fate? What? Well, that we can't avoid it... Like: my milk stopped today. Maybe it's not an accident. - Did you request milk? - I bought some online. Éva, fuck! Don't buy black market milk! It's totally illegal, plus who knows what diseases she might have. Or what meds she might be taking, or what do I know... Don't do things like that. And you could get fined for it. Are you playing a game? Hello! So... Look who's keeping secrets! If I don't go, I don't find out about Ákos? There's nothing to know. We're not even together. Really? I have to go now. I'm working. Come over on the weekend! We could talk! I don't know. We'll see. Kisses. Kisses. Hello! Hi! - Is Matyi asleep? - Uh-huh. What's this? I found a moth in the oat flour. Have you eaten? I'm not hungry. Guess what? Adél's dating one of your workers. Isn't she leaving the country? Yes. Who? I don't know his name. Ákos, I think. Congratulations. Your sister has great taste. - You know about that tree in the lot? - What? - The one that has to be cut down. - Uh-huh. Can't we replant it? Please! - Are you kidding? - No. What for? Because it's pretty. Just because. It's not hard to do. - "Lift the tree out with the largest... - Éva? root ball as possible, and dig a similar hole, but twice as wide." Stop it. I can't deal with this in the middle of a huge investment. Okay, but... Are you really that bored? Have you seen the lactation consultant? Yes. - I thought he left a while ago. - His car is in the lot. That's his business. So, will you come over to say goodbye? I dreamt it was Tamás's funeral and Adél was reciting a poem she wrote. I didn't understand it, but the others liked it. I'm bringing Ákos along too. Kisses. I saw that the vines had grown over our legs. They were like snakes. - Hello! - Hello! - Hi! - Hi! The flat is gorgeous. These stairs are great! You want to see it outside, too? Éva, come! I need to finish this! I'm starving. - We'll look outside after. - Which city are you going to? - Éva said, but... - Tromsø. - That's north, right? - Yes. It'll be real cold in winter. Ákos, will you go too? - It depends on Adél. We'll see. - I hope so. - Really? - Sure. There's plenty of cheap flights now. - What is it?! - You need help?! Don't... It's okay. It's almost done. Just sit! Matyi's sleeping. Let's not shout, okay? Hello. Can I give you a hand? Tell her that she has post-partum depression. Do you know a good expert she can see? Go on. I'll be right in. Okay. Ákos, who will be our crane man if you leave us, eh? - So right now, they're just ghost homes. - Uh-huh. Totally negative cash-flow, but they make the cityscape nicer. It matters if you're fucking or getting fucked. Fucking awesome. They pay for the idea of something. Why else do you work on a crane? - This is it. - This looks good. - Yeah, but there's no demand at all. - I see. This table is really great! Thank you! It fermented in a smaller barrel, as you can smell. It smells like tomorrow's headache. - Shall we get going? - Uh-huh. You're leaving already? - Yes. - Everything was very tasty. - Absolutely. - Well, I'll call you a taxi. I have my car. Don't bother. Don't go yet. It's late. Why don't you sleep over? Please, sleep over. Why the fuck is my crane man in my guest bedroom? Are you crazy? I have to be up at 5 to drive to Vienna. I slave all day to give you all this, and then I drive home for you just to endure this nonsense? Seriously. Are you crazy? Take a look at yourself! Blow your nose! Look! Look how pretty you are! Look! This is fucking great! Just what I was in the mood for! Wash your face. I'm going to bed. Oh, sorry! Do you have another bathroom? I'm done already. Come. Everything okay? Uh-huh. Have you been crying? No. Because of Adél? - Are you going to pee? - No. I wanted to talk to you. Is it something about Tamás? Then what? I can't stand that you're together. Are you joking? No. I'm in love with Ákos. Okay. The one with the edge is cream cheese. The other is salami. See? - Mom, the flight's 2 hours. I doubt... - Okay, okay. Throw it out then. Why did I make them? I won't throw it out, but we just ate. I don't think it's... Give it here then and I'll eat it for lunch. Okay. Ah, my darling honey! - Write to us. As soon as you get there. - Okay. My baby chickadee. - Do you have gum? - I forgot. I'll go get you some. OK? I'll be right back. Does she want purple or blue Airwaves?! What?! Does Adél want purple or blue Airwaves?! Do you want purple or blue Airwaves? - I don't give a shit. - Whichever! Please, don't leave like this. Can I hug you? Don't. This isn't fair. I can't breathe. - Calm down. - I'm suffocating! Jesus, what's wrong with you? I'm going to be late and she's having a panic attack. Well, I don't know. Without asking Tamás... We're not asking because it's a surprise. So... I brought two shovels. Feri will help too. Hello, Tree! What are you doing here? I'm going for a run. Watch Matyi, OK?
