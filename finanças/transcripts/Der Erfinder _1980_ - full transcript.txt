FOR VERENA THE INVENTOR My dear loyal fellow citizens! War is upon us. We have called our army to arms. Our army has the sublime duty to protect our country in case of attack... ...and repel the attacker, whoever it might be... by force. We don't want war. But neither do we fear war. It has always been believed... ...that if we always stay calm... ...wars will stop respectfully outside our borders. We all hope it happens this time too. Even though I can't contradict the opinion of many of our leaders... ...it would do our people good... ...to be cured of such a belief... ...by some severe setbacks. This serious situation led the Federal Council to conduct a nationwide review of all mobilizable citizens who were able to fire a gun. We expect all those... ...who will be declared fit for service... ..to perform their duty with joy... ...and be ready to sacrifice their blood and life for their country. The war requires... ...that everyone follow their leader with loyalty and reliability. That they prefer to go hungry... ...endure pain, or lose their life... ...rather than not fulfill their duty. From my point of view, no matter what we do... ...we must do well what we do... ...and be able to say to ourselves... "I did my duty." To be able to say that, it is the most beautiful thing. Shoes under the benches, socks in the shoes and silence! Next...! Nussli, Jakob! Hey, they're calling you... Go on! Military record! Nussli, Jakob, born 1880 Canton of Zurich. Rejected, UC diagnosis. Size: 176. Ches circumference: 93. Arm circumference: 32. Visual acuity: good. Hearing acuity: good. Are you fit for shooting? What? Do you know how to shoot? Hands out of pockets! No. Have you had a serious illness or accident since your last examination? What? - Do you have dirty ears? - No, I don't hear well. - Hard of hearing? - Yes. Last time, you heard fine. Do you have a certificate? - What? - A medical certificate? - For what? - For your hearing, do you have one? For what? Since when do you hear badly? - How? Since when has your hearing been bad? Since last summer. Suddenly? Yes, I fell from the cherry tree... onto the cart. - On your head? - No, onto the cart. When I woke up a few hours later, I couldn't hear properly. It was a Monday, and on Friday, when I... I don’t remember what I wanted to say. Sometimes it all leaves me. - Which doctor treated you? - Yes. - "Yes" what? - Pardon? What is your doctor's name? No doctor treats me. Do you hear that sound? It tickles. Can't hear anything? What? - Can't hear anything? - No nothing. Jump! What? Jump, up, up! Higher! - Good! - I can jump longer. Stop, I said! What do we do with a guy like this? What? No military service! I haven't felt so good for a long time. Me neither. If I'd had to go, I’d've shot myself in the foot, the first day. I always think of the poor guys who never see the sun. In France, Germany... ...in Italy, in Belgium, everywhere. 900,000. When we imagine that, it is unimaginable for the imagination. It's madness. I've often dreamt of it. It's always the same dream. I dream it started with us. I'm in a hole somewhere, and the church bells ring. They're shooting from everywhere. Behind us, in front, everywhere. I suddenly turn around and I shoot the one who shouted "Fire!" And then I wake up because of the bells. I always jump when they ring. Not for long. Because I have a plan. Against the bells? You promise me not to tell anyone? Word of honor from a Hungarian. Do you remember my cousin Walter? The one who went into exile? Who shat in front of the priest's door? That's him. He left for America six years ago. He started out as a car mechanic and now has a workshop of 20 employees. I'll go to his house. In America? Yes. Otti will make the big crossing to America. You can become someone... not like yourself. I've read that they always need mechanics. - And your workshop? - A bicycle workshop without bicycles. The Germans can no longer deliver. No point. Cars are the future. In America there will soon be more cars than bikes here. Yeah. Oh yes! That's what Otti will do. A car workshop in America. Alright, here we go. Going back home? Yes. Thanks, Jacob! Thanks. It's Sunday, tomorrow? No, Wednesday. Oh darn! Wednesday... CLOSED DUE TO ILLNESS Thanks, Jakob! - Good night, Otti! - Thank you, Jakob! Sleep well! I'm coming! - Father, food's ready. - Yes, I heard. - You finished down there? - Yes. What are you doing? Go home! I'm coming. Is the cart broken? You hear me? Sugar! Hi Kobi! Were you in the woods? Show me! Want some sugar on it? - Sugar! - Go see Martha. She'll give you some. But we want some, too. Watch what you're doing! Jakob, why are you looking out the window? I'd like to see how it'll get out of the mud. It's the boss. Go and help him! Have to push. Come on, Kobi, gotta push! Gotta make a fire! Accelerate gently! It's stuck. If it doesn't work, get a draughthorse. It'll be OK. Good! Look at the car! You stay there to fill in the holes! There's gravel at the creek below. Now you're responsible for the state of the access-road. Heard that? You're responsible. Shit! Look, Seppli. All the weight of a cart weighs on these few centimetres... ...where the wheel touches the ground. If the cart is heavy and the road is soft... ...the cart is always sinking. I thought a flat object could be attached to the wheel. Something that extends in front and straightens up behind. As for the railway? No, not a rail... a kind of artificial road... that the car takes with it. So we could go anywhere. Cross the meadow, in the mud. Anywhere you want. Oh, that'd be great. Come on Seppli. We must go. You might set foot in the church again! Me? I never go all year! I don't want to take people's place on Sunday. No... I have to go with Otti to the forest. Jakob, something will happen one day. During mass, is the best time. This rabbit will cost you dearly. I won't eat it. I'll eat it alone, then. Come, Seppli. Excuse me, where can we buy pork meat on the sly... Some smoked meat or a nice ham? A nice ham? We'd like some of that. Accompanied by a good wine. - Who was he? - No idea. One of those speculators. I've seen him driving past here a few times. A little pork, my eye. He wants to buy pigs. - To raise prices! - But where will it stop? In town, they almost fight for a few potatoes. The food industry has doubled its profits since the beginning of the war. - Double! - And what are our socialists doing? They watch while eating their porridge. Good shot! Martha? Father wrote that he was coming home. I thought something bad had happened. He's fine? Yes. He's happy to come home. - Where's Jakob? - Out the back... tinkering. As soon as he gets home, he goes to the barn. Lisbeth, what is it? Sit down. It'll pass. Do you have this often? I don't know what it is. I vomit every morning. Since when have you had this? I don't know... A few weeks. You can tell me. I'm your aunt. Have you been with someone? Does that make you sick? You must be really sweating. - I couldn't go to the office anymore. - We have to be sure first. Martha, I'm afraid... of my father. If only my mother was still alive! Let's see if you're having your period, first. I hope it works. It works. If the blood is hot, the period comes. The hotter, the better. So heat it again! - Can you come outside for a minute? - Yes. - I need to talk to you. - Yes. I have to catch up with military service. I need somewhere to leave my kid. Do you know a farmer? It's difficult. Maybe at the mayor's. Victor... How old's your boy? Ten years. He is healthy and hardworking. I should talk to him. - How old are you? - 10. You don't sleep in their bed anymore? No. Whose boy is this? Our foreman's. - A factory worker? - Yes. A socialist? I'll certainly not take the son of a socialist. - He's not a socialist. - Of course he is! Everyone working in a factory is a socialist. They may be the death of us all. While we're better off, those bastards want to deprive the peasants of freedom. Nationalization... forced to sell! None of that here! And I also have a question for you. It seems that you speak without thinking. What? Half of the members of the municipal council would be idiots. I didn't say it like that. I said that half of the members weren't stupid. As mayor of the town... ...I welcome our innkeeper! He is back. One more man in the village. We really need it. Even if our women work hard... ...they don't replace men in these difficult times. And so... to Philipp! - Here's to Philip! - Cheers! Cheers! Enjoy your food! Finally back home! Where is Jakob? At home. You still look so pretty, Martha. Pretty... It can't be like this every night. Just let me work. Come to bed! You'll make yourself sick. I can't stop now. You'll go crazy with your inventions. Stop it now. In three hours, we have to go to work. Go to bed... you'll catch cold. I won't go to work tomorrow. You can't not go to work. Why not? It works! By jingo, it works! Did you see Seppli? It works! She no longer sinks. If the road is fixed to the wheel, we no longer need a road. No one had thought of that yet. A car that takes its own road. With it, you can go anywhere. Where you want. Even in the creek? Of course. - Shall we try? - Yes! Give me the whip! Come on! Stopped! That doesn't make sense. - Have to push! - Don't push! - Shit! Stopped! - You have to push! Gotta make a fire! - That's enough. - We gotta make a fire. - Take that. - We gotta make a fire. We're going to warm his stomach. He likes that. He'll see, that bastard. Get behind, but be careful! You bastard! Push! Push! Something coming? No nothing. Help me. I'm so scared. You're my aunt. You don't want me to talk to Philipp? He is going to kill me. No he won't. And sometimes I'd like to have another one. How was it? What? When you were with him. Go up again! Hello everybody! Hello, father! Where's Jakob? He's not here. Now this! What a swine! Yes, a swine! - But we love each other. - Love love! If you can't get married! If I found a job... As long as you're blacklisted... ...there'll be no job. You know yourself, you're blocked. Why are you on the list? I was on the strike committee. That, and more. Listen, my boy... there's the door. You stay here! A bike? Not a new one, but it must be sturdy. You can look in the barn. Watch your head! It has no rear wheel. It doesn't matter. It needed to be modified anyway. What do you mean, "modify"? I have an idea. What's that? An invention. Eh? Make room for me! With this bike, you can go anywhere. In the fields, in the forest, everywhere. A bicycle with an artificial road. A bike for fields and forests? Are you OK otherwise? I can't build it myself, because I don't have the tools. Why do you want to build it? How much will a bike like this cost? if you build me a prototype? Why do you need a bike to cross fields? Why not? There's no car which crosses fields. Not yet. But there are roads. And when there are no roads... ...and the tracks are bad? That's the problem. What's the use of inventing motorcycles and cars... ...if there are no suitable roads? The car is good in the city, because there are roads. But in the country, roads are for horse-drawn carriages. Do you think that in Switzerland, we can build roads just for cars? Just imagine! Roads would cost more than all the motorcycles and cars put together. No... In the countryside, you need a vehicle having its own road with it. It's cheaper. It's not a stupid idea. It's not stupid at all. Can you build me this? A bicycle with rails, like the railroad... ...which takes the rails with it. How much would it cost? First I need to calculate how much it costs. In America it would be nice. Over there, there are large fields and a long rainy season. Father, I want to become an inventor too. I know what to invent. What? Something to transform this oatmeal porridge into sausage. Eat it now! And you too! What are you writing here? - A contract. - For what? For my business. I founded a company of inventors with Otti. - But you have no money. - Exactly. I have the ideas. He builds the prototype and advances part of the costs. It will incorporated later... him one-third, me two-thirds. You can at least tell me why are you doing this? It's stronger than me... I can't think of anything else. This is perhaps the biggest step for transport since the invention of the wheel. - What are we going to live on? - Off my invention. It pays nothing. Inventing is not a job. My invention could be essential everywhere in the countryside. If I get on average two francs for each machine... ...and there are on average two per village... Calculate a bit... Count the villages in Switzerland. Abroad, too, there are villages. How much the wheel-inventor get? From now on, the slices of bread will be smaller. This is what pigs eat. I can't stand this anymore! You eat it now! - Hello, Jakob! - Good evening, Gerhard! I wanted to talk to you about Seppli. - He often dreams at school. - What about? No idea. I'd be interested to know. He's not always focussed on his work, and has a lot of imagination. Better too much imagination than not at all. Is that the cart everyone's talking about in the village? Yes. Interesting. It is very good. - The army would need it. - For what? So that artillery and vehicles don't sink in the mud. Show that to the army! To the army? Are you crazy? My invention? Surely not! Please leave... Let me work! You hear me? Leave! Do you hide the carrots because of the socialists? - Why socialists? - So they don't steal them. - Socialists don't steal carrots. - Yes, the teacher said so. Socialists want to break everything and steal. Your teacher chatters without thinking. I'll tell you what a socialist is. If the waitress forgets to charge you for a cigar... ...and you say nothing, like your teacher... ...you are not a socialist. But if a bank manager loses his wallet... ...with 1000 francs in it, a socialist takes it without remorse. Have you ever found a wallet? No never. So you're not a socialist? Not really. Good! Good! Good! Good! Good! Good! Good! Good! Here... “General Conditions of Insurance”. Yes, there it is. If the insurance recognizes the accident... ...then the compensation, according to the limbs scale... ...is 12 percent for the right index finger. It's the left, not the right. Oh yes! 10 percent. 10 percent of what? The amount of the insurance. 10,000 francs. 1,000 francs. 1000 francs! But you're still crazy. Why? 9 fingers are enough. Look out! Be careful! I resign. Finished. The factory. Jakob, you're a bit cracked. That good? Happy birthday! You don't have to wash it, otherwise it'll rust. Thanks! Others would be happy to go to the factory and get a job. I'm not others. You're really mad. Listen, Martha. At the factory, we make ammunition boxes. They're as much for the war as rifles and cannons. Read the newspaper, you'll see what madness it is. If you put side by side all the dead of this war... ...in a row, with the first in Zurich... ...the last would be in Madrid. Just imagine! No. Ammunition boxes do nothing for people. My invention, yes. Look out, I'm coming! Again! It's silly. It does nothing for a bike. It's too tiring for the legs. That's what I'm saying. You should try on a car with a powerful engine. On a large vehicle. Where's the money from? Your 1,000 francs won't be enough. I'll place an ad. "Which manufacturer offers his car?" "Involving research for an invention." Not so stupid. In a newspaper that manufacturers and economics people read. In a capitalist newspaper? Exactly! "Capitalist research!" in the “Zuricher Zeitung”. Car with built-in road CAPITALIST INVENTOR CAPITALIST RESEARCH Can we write it like this? “Capitalist search for participation" Development of a promising invention... ...which could be totally new for transport. Loan or equity participation, possible participation in the evaluation. Announcement... Shouldn't you first talk to a patent lawyer? To do what? To check if something like that doesn't already exist. A lawyer won't know that. He can help you to file the patent. It'll just cost a lot of money. How did you get this idea? I read that this thought of thing needs to be tied up quickly. Where did you read that? In a book. What book? That... “Handbook for Inventors”. Look at this! It's not drowning. You know why? Because it can swim. Yes, and because it's smart. Once a frog jumped into a bucket of cream. It couldn't get out because it was slippery. But she was cunning, and didn't give up. She started thinking, and she had an idea. Do you know how she got out? - She licked up all the cream. - No. A frog can't eat that much cream. It started pedalling and paddling with her legs, like crazy. For hours. Until the cream became butter. And then it was able to climb out. The beginning of summer has been a little wet, it seems. 40 acres, you said? Yes, 40 acres. 40 times 400... 18 francs per 100 kilos. Eighteen? It's not enough for us. We'll wait a little longer. If the socialists stock of potatoes goes to the government... ...there'll be an obligation to sell and prices will fall. In Germany, potatoes cost half. What were you thinking? - 23. - Impossible! 20 is the maximum legal price. It's controlled. We know. Bonuses are not controlled. We want the maximum price... ...plus 3 francs bonus per 100 kilo. 2 franks. 3 franks. Who's that? I'd like to know what he's looking for here. What do you want? Hello, I'm from Winterthur. It shows. Factory worker? I'm looking for potatoes. There are no potatoes here. Do you see potatoes somewhere? No. I don't see any potatoes either. - We have nothing left to eat. - We neither. Get out now, you socialist! I can pay. You hear me? Or do we have to chase you? "I'm looking for potatoes." Wow! A socialist, too! I'm not crazy. You have to know how to wait. To wait. One's not normal. It just doesn’t leave him alone. Martha, Jakob is sick. It's no longer fanaticism, it's a sickness. Just like our father, before he got depressed. - He's not depressed. - But he's crazy. It's madness, I tell you. Who says that? - I inquired - Who with? Dr Haberli. From the asylum? He says to cut off a finger, is not normal. It could be a sign of madness. He spoke of a "psychiatric original". He should be looked at closely and kept under observation. That's what he said. Do you want him locked up? Put in the asylum? Your own brother? Maybe it's best for him... ...we'll be left in peace. You are his brother! Think about your future, Martha! You can come and live with me. Let go of me! Get it through your head... I married your brother and not you! Jakob is my husband and I am his wife! Someone has to take over his responsibilities. We'll be quite fine without you. Alright then. Go and look for work in town, if things go bad. A woman always finds work in town, if she wants. You're pretty! When your father gets home, tell him that I'm taking embroidery to the factory. Yes. - Goodbye Seppli! - Goodbye, mother! - Goodbye, Mr Schmutz. - Bye. Next! - Hello, Mr Schmutz. - Hello, Mrs Nussli. I see four that I can't use. That's unfair... They're all the same. Alright... So stop doing it! Next! You want to say something else? Here, it's me who decides what is good and what is not. Yes, Mr Schmutz. Now you're beautiful, Bruni. Stop! It's not a mountain pasture climb. You have to present an invention. It's important. It's in the book... "The presentation, is half the invention”. Oh yes? This thing will fall off during the ride. You don't have to to drive like crazy. You can also put a tie on her. Interesting... Are you Mr Nussli? Yes. - Very interesting. In this weather, all my respect! I would like to show this construction to my engineer. If he thinks that we can develop your idea... ...we'll sign a contract. GOTTLIEB PFENNINGER Manufacturer The first time I saw you in this suit, was at our wedding. You still love me? Yes. So why don't you ever say it? I love you. What happened? My father kicked me out. - He doesn't want to see me again. - Come at our place. You can sleep in the upstairs bedroom. I am scared. If the office manager finds out... If he fires you, come and work in my company. You know how to type letters. God bless you! Mr Nüssli, a cigar? Gladly. Thanks. Your idea is a car which takes its own path with it. To do this, short stretches of road are therefore fixed on the wheel? It's an original idea... ...but a similar invention already exists. It's known in the army as a belt wheel. But it's not the same. These plates are fixed. My artificial road is mobile. The engineer said "similar". Your idea is very interesting... But not yet economically viable. Don't get me wrong! I have great appreciation for your basic idea. But it doesn't seem to me to be mature enough as yet. Take time! You are talented. When you've advanced come and see us again... We'll gladly help you. We really encourage you to develop your idea. As an engineer, I would like to know... ...if it works if the artificial road, as you call it... ...is attached to the drive wheels. I'd like to know too, but for that I need a tractor... ...or a truck. I'd like to show you something. I brought something. A designer gave me a drawing. - You see? - Yes. It's interesting. I can easily imagine it. - What do you think? - Absolutely, Sir. I'd like to know if it works. I'll make you an offer. I put a tractor at your disposal. Thank you, Mr. Manager! A nice toy of no practical value. Dismantle your artificial road. I will have the tractor removed tomorrow. You did it wrong. - Wrong? - He saw nothing with this fog. He's not a true capitalist. He knows nothing about it. A true capitalist would have seen how innovative our invention is. It'd be different in America. That's where the real capitalists are. It's here that there are the greatest inventions. Jakob, what's going on? You know what it is? A churn. No, a butter machine. Listen! - Can you hear? - Nothing. The butter is made automatically. Good God, but what is it? Don't take them out! What is this nonsense? You said frogs could make butter. It takes time for an invention. You always say that. Maybe we should rethink everything from the beginning. Without me. I want to see the 1,000 francs first. I've already thrown enough money out the window. It would be best if finished with it. Give up? No way. If no one had ever wished to move with something other feet... ...we'd never have invented the bicycle or the steam engine. Or the railroad! The car, aeroplanes! Where was this invented? In Switzerland? In America. Great inventions can be made here. Otto... Look at this! The chain. So? That's it... a chain. A ribbon. An endless ribbon. Good God, why didn't I think of that sooner! We always think of the simplest last. Yes! Look... This is it! You've had fair warning... When you pay your taxes you'll get it back. Father... why is Viktor taking our cow? Catch it? Come on, bottoms up, Kobi! - Down the hatch! - Down the hatch! Have you fallen in the water again? I'm getting fed up with it... It's a swamp, not a road. If it keeps raining, we can bring the gravel by boat. Must push! Must push! No pushing, Kobi. In this weather, pushing is useless. You have to push! Pushing is almost over, Kobi... when Jakob has finished his machine. I won't push any more? If we can go on gravel with Jakob's machine... ...we won't need you anymore. There'll be nothing more to push. No more pushing? It'll be finished. Go look in Jakob's barn! That's where our inventor works. Mr know-it-all. No more pushing? No, more pushing when the machine is finished. No more pushing, Kobi. Go see Jakob! - No more pushing? - You'll see! How do you want us to continue? With what? We'll soon have nothing and the machine doesn't work. - It'll soon be working. - That's what you always say. Kobi, what happened to you? You're all wet. Is no one taking care of you? No more pushing! My God, Kobi! What are you doing? Are you crazy? No more pushing! Jakob! My God, Kobi! Hey! Kobi! - I think that'd be best. - Me too. I agree. As pastor of the asylum, I'll speak to the manager. - Do you put that in the report? - Yes. As Viktor said... ...as a municipal authority, we are responsible... ...for the well-being of underage citizens. In this case, for Seppli. I believe that we owe it to Martha too. He went at me, in his barn the other day. I was really scared. I think that he might suddenly turn on Martha. So this is best, before something else happens. Yes. Why did he have to have a wife who's not from around here? We can close our meeting. - Are we stopping next door? - Of course. Fantastic! Hold on! Which hand do you want? Left. Perfect! Listen now. Introduction... Who does not know the efforts that draught animals must provide... ...on poor ground or to empty gravel pits. We could often talk of animal torture on seeing... ...how draught animals are forced to move heavy vehicles... ...wheels are sinking up to the axle in mud. Thanks to a brilliant invention, it has become possible... ...to put better use to the strength and health of animals. That's really good! The economic benefits of vehicle with artificial road... ...compared to a normal vehicle are the following... First of all... the loading of the vehicle... ...can be tripled, for the same traction force. Second... unaffected by dips and holes in the road. So... saving energy and time. Thirdly... usable in all seasons. The paths can be muddy, snowy or icy. Fourth: the car with artificial road Can also replace railways in areas where there are none. Yes. Fifthly... driving on coarse ballast... on fine gravel or grassland remains the same. Good! Good! Has your head stopped spinning? Naughty Jakob. Jakob didn't mean to hurt you. Naughty Jakob. No, he didn't want to hit you. He was just afraid for his wagon. - Kobi push more? - Of course. Surely you can help push. And when Jakob's wagon is finished, you can go up there. Kobi driving. Kobi driving. - When can you start? - Next week. - Jakob, we can get married soon. - Oh yes. Jakob, what's the matter? Otti is gone. To America. To America? And now? Listen... I calculated something. For a load of 6,000 kg, it takes five horses. A horse costs 10 francs a day. What makes 15,000 francs in costs for a year of 300 working days. For the same load, with our wagon, 2 horses are enough. That's 20 francs a day. And 6,000 francs a year. That's 9,000 francs less. How about that!? Yes. And now listen! In 12 years, with compound interest... ...it saves operating costs of 134,190 francs! How about that! Yes. I'll go into town to see a patent lawyer. They'll be very surprised, in the village. - Surprised. - Yes, surprised! - How did you get her? - I went and got her. - How'd you do that? - None of your business. Now you look like a real inventor. Do you have a clean hankie? Yes. - Won't you take Kobi? - What for? He would like to take the train. Alright. Soon we'll be eating bacon and beans again. Kobi, stay here and wait! Don't wander off... Is that understood? - I'll be back soon. - Yes. Hold my cigar for me. Good morning... I've an appointment with Mr Rosenthal. - Nussli, inventor. - Ah, yes. Hello, Mr. Nussli! Mr Rosenthal told me to tell you... ...that he had to leave suddenly. You'll need to come back later. Say around 4pm? By 5pm he'll be here for sure. 5pm, fine. Bye! Bye! We came too early. Hello, Martha! Good morning. Good morning. Where is Jakob? Not here, why? Where is he? What for? I asked you where he was. And I asked you why you wanted to know. When is he coming back? What do you want him for? We want to talk to you, Martha. As mayor, it's my duty to inform you of a Council decision regarding Jakob. Can we talk about it inside? Calmly? What decision? That's what we want to talk to you calmly about. You want to lock him up? THE GREAT BATTLE OF THE SOMME NEW PROGRAM TWICE A WEEK Do you want to go to the cinema? You've never been to the cinema, have you? Cinema? We'll see something here. We'll still have time. Come on, let's go! Yes, Kobi see. Cinema. Come on, let's go to the front. We'll be alone. GERMAN TROOPS TRAIN TO USE THE ENEMY TANK. Push! Push! - Push! - Quiet! I would like to know. I'm going to Belgium to speak with him. Find out why he sold my invention in the army. I would like to know... ...what kind of person he is. We should go. God bless you. Just for an investigation... until you're well again. The Lord our Almighty will protect you. Goodbye, Jakob. It's actually not all that silly... You can come to my place while you're waiting. Is father an inventor now? Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
