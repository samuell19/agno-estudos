And now a garland... What’s the matter? Hey Rabindra! Where have you been? Kept me waiting all this time! Sorry, man. We haven’t even started, and you're already making me wait. I was supposed to pick up my kids from school. They must still be waiting for me. So where is it? This is it. Have you lost your mind? Why? It’s perfect. Tenzin, are you crazy? We can’t do it here. Why are you whispering? Tenzin... What are you doing? Rabindra, come inside. Tenzin... Don’t! Look. Wow. Look. Come here. I came yesterday and took some pictures. You did what? Come on. Let’s go. Do you have any idea what this place is? The womb of the goddess! Let’s get out of here. It was destroyed in the earthquake. Yeah, and it’s been abandoned. From your mother? Why? You're nuts! It’s called an investment, idiot. Start again. Again. And you got another partner? Why? Rabindra’s street smart, but he doesn’t have good taste. This new guy trained in Italy. Wait and see, I’ll have the best coffee shop in all of Nepal. Tenzin. Do like this. Look! It’s scarily small. Tenzin! The monk told me, if there's a gap it’s a sign of death. Hey... This is death we're talking about. You think I’m an idiot, and backward. You think you’re such a modern guy. Hello? Rabindra? In Boudha? That's not going to work. Keep looking. I'll be there soon. As soon as this stupid music lesson is done. Just don't do anything until I get there. Are you listening? That dream you had. It's a sign of death. Muerte. You know that monk? He said this girl is really special. She has fangs and a moustache, and sometimes, she even has three eyes. You believe that? Come on. Let’s go there. We have time. It’s on the way. OK. We'll go. So now what? The monk says if we drink tea made by her, it’ll bring good luck. You know those monks are just after your money. OK, we’re late. He’ll be mad. Anyway, there’s nothing here. Tenzin! Tenzin! Look, there she is! Where’s her moustache? And the three eyes? Where are her fangs? Come on. Let’s go. We’re late. OK. Play it again. What's up with you today? Listen. This is how it's done. Hey Girl! Concentrate! Know it by heart by next Wednesday. Kunsel, you know this song. So give these two some lessons. But I’m busy. You guys are distracted. Let’s stop here today. You know... For whatever reason, your mother thinks you have talent. I’m only doing this because of her. In fact, she asked me to do a few things. She even asked me to find you a wife. What do you think? Isn't it good? Are you serious? Are you out of your mind? Why? What’s wrong with it? It’s good. You want a place for stupid boors? What? Do you think we’re in Europe or America? We need style... taste. Style and taste are for people with money and no brains. Forget it. Let’s go! Let's go the other way, the main road’s dug up. So how many foreigners are coming? Around 20. We have to really impress them. Maybe advertise on Instagram. Sure. And we can also open a Facebook page. Okay. Let’s start from the beginning. The prelude. Keep practicing. I don’t think she will teach us this song. Aren’t we supposed to know it by tomorrow? It’s so boring! The soup is almost ready. Get the bowls. If... If you dream of a dead relative... Does it mean something? Who knows? Maybe they have some unfinished business. Did you dream of your sister? It wasn’t really a dream. What? You saw her for real? Look, let’s go and see the monk. He’s psychic. He said you’ll find the perfect place for your coffee shop. What? Have you been blabbing about me? What are you guys talking about? Don't tell her. Dreams? Tell me. What is it? I heard something about a monk. There’s this monk... a psychic. We’re talking about him. Can I see him too? We can all go together. Jachung... I’m a bit busy today. But what about the soup? I know. Next time - I promise. Sorry. She's so rude. Idiot! How could you fall for someone like her? Cheers, you guys. Cheers! Cheers for doing this. So tell me, where is it going to be the coffee shop? I found the perfect place. It’s amazing! Actually, I haven’t even told my partner yet. Really? Yeah, I just found it the other day. You have to see it. It’s yeah... it’s great. Can’t wait. Excuse me. Jachung. What are you doing here? I called you so many times but you didn't pick up. I bumped into him. So I told him to stop by just a bit. Jachung. This isn't the best time for this, can't you see? The coffee smells good. Can I have some? Can I have coffee please? OK. Thank you. Hey Tenzin, is everything alright? Yeah. Who are those people? That strange monk wearing sunglasses inside... It’s my stupid friend. I don’t know why he brought that lama here. Anyway, enjoy the party. I’ll be right back. What time was your dream? Before midnight? Or at midnight? Or in the early morning? Don’t reject dreams. Even dreams have order. Dreams that occur before and at midnight reflect daytime habits and demons’ tricks. Wow! Is it Blue Hill? I mean – Is it Blue Mountain? No. So good! If the dream was early in the morning, that could be significant, like Jachung said. If you saw a field of flowers, then your life force is running out. Tenzin, there you are. I want to introduce you to someone. He writes for Lonely Planet. Please, come out. Yeah. Please wait. I’ll be right there. Look. I have to go. How long does he have to live? First tell me: What time did you have the dream? Tell him. When was it? Did you have any other dreams? Special dreams? Have you forgotten? Have you? I can hear him. Why are you repeating everything? I dream a lot. Look, I really have to go. I’m busy. We can do this some other time. This is too much! I don’t want to be a partner anymore. How can you even think of opening a coffee shop here?! Why do you need to be all stylish and unique? I can understand nice spoons, plates, forks, tables. But this? You're asking for my whole life’s savings. I don’t want to throw it away. Hey. I’ve also put all my mother’s savings into this. You know what? Tenzin doesn't believe in any of this. I see. He thinks it's all made up. What in this world isn't? It's all made up. Is it enough just to drink her tea? You don't have to do anything else? Actually, you could also try to wash her feet and drink that water. But unless you do it with belief from the bottom of your heart, it's useless. Actually, there’s no point talking about this to people like you. Hey Dev. Hey Tenzin. Ciao. I’ve got good news, man. Rabindra’s back on board. Wow. How did you manage that? It wasn’t easy. Where are you? I’m at Pilgrim’s. Pilgrim’s? What are you doing there? That place is for junkies, man. Are you taking drugs now? Somebody said the coffee’s good here. I wanted to see. Okay, I’ll talk to you later. I don’t even know what’s real anymore. She isn't coming. I’ll go after this. She’ll come. Just wait for a few minutes. Do you even know what she’s doing? What are you talking about? Does she have lovers? I didn’t say that. Then what? How should I say this? I see things that no one else does You wouldn’t believe it. Come in, the door is open. Oh. It’s you. I grew up eating cereal in Canada, cereal will be my last obstacle to enlightenment. So, did you have any dreams? No. I saw a woman wearing a red dress. Tail? What? Three eyes? No. She had fangs. You have lost your lha. What is lha? How can I explain? When you lose your lha, you can no longer recognize the difference between bad and good. You attract misfortune. Can you find a tiger to gaze at? The best is a real tiger. That would help. But that’s difficult. Do you have any turquoise? If you do, wear it. If a lama has blessed it, even better. I don’t know if I'm dreaming or not. Maybe it's just my imagination. What’s the difference? Anyway, you’ll die soon. How do you know? I study these things. Wanna make a bet? If I lose, I’ll give you my headphones. You don’t have much time left. Better go and see your friends and relatives. If you have any money, spend it all and have some fun. I heard you’re a modern man, so you won’t offer to monasteries anyway. When did you first see her? The day before yesterday. But I told you: I don’t know if it’s a dream or just my mind playing tricks. No difference. Bottom line is - you’ll die soon. Be careful. You’ll be dead next Saturday. Try to die on Sunday instead. What difference does it make? If you die on a Saturday, nine members of your family will die after you. Try to postpone it until Sunday. Are you joking? I’m serious about death. Why should I joke about death? Oh. There is one way out. You have to find a dakini. I’m sure you don’t know what I’m talking about. How do I explain it to you? You have to find a woman. Why should I find a woman? I’m being chased by a woman. That’s why you need to look for another woman. A special one. This is a special method. A way to see the flaw as the truth. And a way to see problems as the solution. Do you understand? I’m sure you’re thinking: Where are these women? How do I know? I’m just trying my best to be a good monk. But I have heard that some dakinis are really beautiful. Let’s ask His Holiness: Omniscient Google. Look. Most of them have fangs. Sexy, no? Do you ever see a woman's shadow? Without anyone being there? I heard that dakinis are everywhere. They can be anywhere, even here as we speak. This is Kathmandu. This is the domain of the dakinis. Yogis come here just to make offerings to dakinis. So, if I bump into one, what am I supposed to do? I think you have to get something from her. I’m not sure, I would like to know myself. You need to get something personal from her. Like a shoelace, a nose ring, and, of course, her underpants. There’s somebody I think can help you. The Master of the Left Hand Lineage. You should go see him. Left hand what? Left Hand Lineage. There’s nothing holier. But I heard he’s unpredictable and temperamental. I know where he is. If you want to go, I can take you. Here. What’s that? There are six knots, every morning, undo one knot, if you can undo all the knots, I’ll give you my headphones. Here take it. Keep this secret. Don’t even tell Jachung. He might tell others. And they will tell others. And if it spreads, won’t you be embarrassed? People will say: Modern man – chasing dakinis. See. Didn’t I tell you? What? You’re blaming Teacher’s sickness on my dream? What’s up with you these days? Well, every day there’s a new challenge. Leave me alone! What happened? Don’t tell him I brought you here. Be careful. He could beat you up. He’s temperamental. He might throw something at you. Who brought you here? So he said dakinis are women? Idiot! What an idiot! Is he a tourist guide who deceives yellow-haired people? What else did he say? Get out! Get out! What did he say? Nothing much. He seemed annoyed that I came. He kept asking why I need a dakini. So, did you tell him? No I didn’t. Why not? It seems so stupid. Will you go back again? No. What is it? Get off. I have to go somewhere. Do I need a brain scan? No. Sometimes I can’t hear anything. Looking at your report, it all looks fine. Do you feel depressed? I can prescribe you anti-depressants. No. Everything looks perfectly alright. Will I live longer than a week? What do you mean? It will happen on the wedding day. Oh! you again. So annoying! Are you on drugs? These days, the only people interested in dakinis are on drugs. No one else in the world gives a damn about dakinis. Or they’re only interested because they think dakinis are sexy women. Now. Sit down! Breathe in slowly. Breathe out. Exhale. Stronger. That is dakini. You won’t understand. I told you. It won’t fit into minds of people like you. So, since you can't comprehend the straight and simple explanation, I'll make it complicated for you. Bring me that. Yes, that. No. That one. That one! No, no! No, no, not that! Yes. Bring that to me. OK. Drink this. Drink it all. Drink! Drink! Drink it all. Yes. Water is dakini. Water is dakini. Understand? I told you. You won’t understand! You won’t understand. People like you can never understand dakini. You won’t understand if I tell you straight. You won’t understand if I make it complicated. So nothing can be done. So, dakinis aren’t sexy women, like you made it sound. He said: “Earth, water, fire, wind, sky they are the real dakinis.” I bet you didn’t have a clue what that meant. Somehow, when he said it, it was so convincing. He just looked at me like I was a table. Have you done anything fishy lately? I went to this place my friend said was the abandoned temple of a goddess. Which one? In Godawari. You mean the one near the river? Did you pee there? I just took some photos. Do you know that's the goddess's vagina? What's wrong with taking photos? You're in real trouble! Rabindra, what do you think about our invitation? Well, I can’t tell if it’s an invitation card or used toilet paper. You never appreciate our work. Tenzin! Can you confirm that your guest list is complete? You’re desperate. That’s good. There are two types of dakinis. Real ones and symbolic ones. Real ones are so difficult to know. You won’t understand. You might understand symbolic ones. But even that’s difficult. Dakinis can be far, far away. Or they can be very near. Some are beautiful and wholesome, some are ugly and vicious. One can never be sure. You understand? Where can I find a dakini? You’re so impatient. You can’t be impatient. I only have few days left. Oh. Is that what you think? Shouldn’t I? Very good. If everyone believed they only had seven days to live, the world would be peaceful. Be bold. Dakinis don't trust people with inhibitions. Didn't you say you sing? You should sing. Sing in crowds. Dakinis will come there. Then you'll have a good chance to see them. You want to know dakinis, yes? You need devotion, and pure perception. And especially you need courage. Dakinis are volatile. If you see a dakini, it can be scary. Go and look for dakinis in different places. There’s a tea seller lady. Yes. I know her. She’s special. Be careful. Don’t tell others what I told you. It’s just between us. If you tell others, and don’t keep it a secret, the dakinis will punish you. The tea seller is special, but she has a guardian: her mother. She is very powerful. If you misbehave, she will kill you. What should I ask her for? Whatever you ask for is fine. But... Before you receive, you have to offer something. What should I offer? Anything, but there are some things that make dakinis happy like, red flowers, fruit, vermilion, garments, ornaments, you can also offer fragrance, but especially, you could offer one left shoe. Dakinis like those. They don’t need offerings. You're doing it for yourself. First you offer, then you supplicate. For what? You should say: “You are my protector, be compassionate to me in all my lives.” And then ask for blessings. How? Whatever comes into your mind. First thought, best thought! Dakinis are equal to spiritual masters. Even from their seemingly mundane behavior, you can learn a lot. Even from the way she knits a sweater, you can learn a lot. I borrowed all my mother’s money. All of it? Okay then, I’ll teach you a secret sign. A gesture. When you see a girl you feel is a dakini, do this gesture. If she is a dakini, she’ll respond. It’s dakini language. But... You need to understand one thing: You can only use this gesture twice. You’re not allowed more. So don’t show the gesture to just anyone. When you have a strong feeling she’s a dakini, do this gesture. Then that will be the dakini. Do the gesture. When you do the gesture, you have to be secret. That’s a must. I’ll teach you the gesture. Do this. And this. And then again, this. Again, do this. And that will work. When you practice this, you have to conceal like we’re doing now. You don't have much time. You don't have the luxury to be embarrassed. What's with the outfit? Tenzin! Look at this. What’s that? For Kunsel's father. When one’s asking for their daughter’s hand, I heard one has to give a present. Jachung. I’m busy today. We’ll do this later. That's it. Turn your knee a little... Yeah! Beautiful! That's beautiful! Beautiful, beautiful expression in your eyes. What are you doing here? How did you find me? Jachung... Jachung likes you very much. Yes. Dad told me. You came here to tell me that? I’ve got something else to tell you. What? What? Can you give me your earring? Don’t make fun of me. I have no time for this. Please! Don’t do this in front of them. You’re embarrassing me. What's up with you Tenzin? What are you wearing? Where have you been? We don’t see you at the coffee shop anymore. We waited for you all day today. We were supposed to sign the contracts today. What’s going on Tenzin? Do you know how many days we’ve been waiting? It’s been three days now. Sorry. Be there at Kailash Restaurant by 10 AM tomorrow. Please. We have to finish up the paper work! Lately, Tenzin is acting so strange. He's a good man, he's been through a lot. His sister's death was really hard for him. Where? Here. How’s your singing and music practice? It’s OK. I know you don't like these traditional songs, but please, for me, can you try? Yes. You have the best teacher. He is really learned. He said you’re the best. No, no, maybe a long time ago. Shall we play a little music together? Tenzin, are you leaving? Please take care of my mother. I may have to go somewhere. If she needs money, it’s in my room. You have the keys. Please don't mention it to her. I may not need to go. It’s fine. Keep going. It’s better to steal now. Steal? Isn’t it bad to steal? Of course it is. Then why are you asking me to steal? Not for me! Don't you need to get something? You have no choice, do you? Aren’t there any women in your life? There is one. There’s a girl who sings with us. How about her? Won’t she do? She can’t be one. It's too late then. You've ruined it by thinking that she might not be. It’s called wrong view. Now it’s too late. Some dakinis are so close you can't see them, like your own eyelashes. Sometimes I don't believe any of this. I know. You’ve got the brain of a yellow-haired person. Yellow-haired people don’t believe things that don’t have proof. They are slaves of reason, and you’re a slave of those yellow-haired people. Don’t waste time. Talk is useless now. It’s all spoiled. Out! Out! Out! You’ve ruined my sleep. Go, go, go. And don’t come back ever again. There’s no point. Tenzin! Tenzin! I need to go somewhere. Please. Where do you need to go? Hanuman Cross. Please! It’s important. OK. Are you ready? Tenzin... Sorry I was rude the other day. But you were acting strange too. Kunsel... What’s going on with you these days? I saw you in different places. And why this outfit today? Please, don’t ask. Even if I tell you, you wouldn't believe it. I don’t know what to believe anymore. I know. Here's good. Thank you. Kunsel! Kunsel! Isn't this nice? And that? How much are these? It's not Rs.300! That's too much! Give me a discount. Only 10rs? Make it 250! Mommy! Mommy! Our bag is gone! Where did you put it? Where is the bag? I had it right here. I told you to hold on to it! Jachung! Jachung! Look! I'm here! Don't you know what time it is? See! I’m alive! Hey, I talked to Kunsel's father about you. It's too late. Oh. She's getting married today. To who? We're invited to the wedding. Oh. In our wisdom tradition before marriage, sometimes a girl first has to clear the obstacles and imbalances that appear in her astrological charts. One way to protect the couple in their future union, is for some girls to first marry a dog. Wedding the dog will protect the future couple and help them to achieve a prosperous and fulfilling life. - How are you guys? - Enjoying? Thank you for coming. OK. Try. Oh, the monk is here. Welcome! Wait! Your favourite - mocha. Thank you. Thank you. Well... I'm sure you're laughing at me for bluffing this whole time. No. Of course not. It's like I died and was reborn. All because of you. Come on. I'm serious. So, where are my headphones? Stolen. What? Really? Nowadays the world’s filled with thieves. Oh! Now what? You're being so strange these days. Did you wash her feet? I did more than that. Really? What did you do? Let’s go! Can I sing an Indian song? This is the big moment. Tenzin! What’s this? I don’t know Do you? I should say I know. Feels like I knew a thousand lifetimes ago. Look!
