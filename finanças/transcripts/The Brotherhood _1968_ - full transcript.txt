A million years, it seems. Yeah, for me, too. Hey... That Emma... You better be good to her. That's some wife you got there. I think she might work out. Frank... I've been thinking About what I'm gonna do now. That thing you told me about in Boston? Global Petrochemical. Sounds pretty good. I don't think so, Frank. No? Don't jump. Don't let nobody push you. With your brains, they're gonna break down doors to get what you got. But you don't have to break down any doors. What do you mean? You know what I mean. You want to come in with me? Unless you don't want me. With your education, you can go anywhere you want. Frank, I'm in. I've always been in, haven't I? You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear you say that. Ginetta brothers. What's better than that? Nothing. You're damn right. I need you, Vince. Honest to god, I really need you. We're gonna show these bananas how to operate, huh? Okay. Now, first thing Monday morning... Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I just got married, remember? All right. When you get back, I'll have all the books ready. The whole works. I'll show you how it all goes together. Books, Vinny... That's all it is now. Not like when Pop was alive. 'Rithmetic. It's just arithmetic, Vinny. That's all it is. Come on, honey, we can't start out like this. Just for a little while, I thought maybe It could be different for us. I thought we could... Thought we could what? Come on, tell me. Let it go, Vince. Let it go. Honey... Honey, I owe him. Ever since I was eight, it's been just Frank and me. He's done everything. Everything. He's got dues coming. He even waited until I grew up before he got married. Now, what am I going to say to him, "Thanks a lot, Frankie. Good bye and good luck?" I can't do that. He needs me. What about the rest, Vince? Honey, I've got two degrees that say, "You need somebody to add two and two fast? "You get Vince Ginetta." Now, that's all I'd be doing. Bookkeeping. Credits. Deficits... Vince, stop kidding yourself. Oh! You want to go in with him. It's not just that you owe him. You want it. Honey, I've lost a lot of time Between the army and school. I'm almost 30 years old. I'm not gonna spend the next 20 years Punching a clock so I can end up a tenth vice president. They need somebody like me. I got a way to go and go quick. I can fit in there my way. There's only one way. Theirs. Okay, now, you just stop. I'm not Frank, And I'm not your old man. Okay. If that's the way you want it... That's the way it's going to be. But I... I don't want to know anything. Nothing. Don't tell me anything, Vince. That's... That's the only way I can do it. I don't want to know. Ever. Please. Please. Jake, Solly. Okay you guys... Just relax. I'll talk to the warden. Your friend the comedian. Hey, sport, I hear you dropped a few scuti at aqueduct. That dumb jockey, he didn't use the whip. How much they take you for? Solly? Oh, sure, some handicapper. Lost a bundle, huh? Listen, it's only money. You still got your first nickel. Emma's due now, huh? You said it. She's got a watermelon there. Looks like another boy. It better be, or we're gonna send it back. Hey, Frank, I hear you're big In the real estate business these days. You kid din'? I got a genius for a brother. You ought to see that guy. You know, he goes through a whole set of books While he's talk in' on the telephone? Brains. Only sometimes too much. Once a month I gotta kick him in the head. Hold all the calls. You gotta do that with geniuses. Could we get started? Hmm? Okay? Uh, first thing, The investigating committee. Now, they got about two more weeks in Cleveland, then they hit us. This attorney general Kessler's got big political ambitions, So he's makin' with the big mouth for next year's elections. He's got a big nose, too. Especially when it comes to the labor thing. He can't be reached? No chance. We know he's after two of us for sure. Dom, you open any place? Couple of small things. I take care easy. How about your union loans? He says he's got big things planned for you, Frank. That's nice. I like people which takes an interest. Well, just check everything twice. This ought to go like the last one. These clowns get on TV, holler a little, get their votes, And everybody goes home happy. Oh, and, Frank, next time there's any problems, Let L.A. handle the contracts, huh? Finks I handle myself. A dead bird right in the mouth. We decided to use L.A. for stuff like that, and only after the vote. We're supposed to operate together, discuss. You button your action, I'll handle mine. That punk deserved it. That's not what Jimmy's talk in' about. Listen, Ginetta, Every time you act like some Brownsville torpedo, You got every sorehead and eager-beaver politician pointing fingers. And that's no good. We gotta be like the wallpaper. Like the furniture. All right. Especially now, the way things are going for us. All right, furniture. I'm a chair. Solly, you be a table. Hey, Dom, you look like a good flower pot, huh? All right, if we're finished with the jokes, Let's get on with the new business. Solly? The major problem has been How to put our surpluses to work In legitimate enterprises. I think this new plan offers one very tangible solution. Funds from our numbered accounts In Switzerland and Central America Can be lent back to certain front men here. People we can buy. No records, good business heads... Solid community types. These men will invest heavily In the smaller electronic companies Subcontracting the government Space and missile projects. We got a survey on these companies? Yes. They're small, But absolutely vital and specialized. With long-range, careful, and planned investments, And certain legal stock manipulations, I think we could eventually control this part of the industry. Then, the second part of the operation is easy. What's the matter, Frank? Well, I don't like it. Look, explain that second part, Sol. Now, how does that go? That's the guarantee we control the entire situation. Once we have these companies, Our labor teams will move in... To organize and consolidate The unions that service them. With increasing international pressures, defense, the space race, I think our position, to say the least, becomes very advantageous. The second part of this operation gives us a considerably big fist. Maybe too big a fist. Oh, boy. Every plan's got something wrong with it lately. What's the matter this time, Frank? Nothing. You just can't put a new idea in that hard Sigi head. What's this? I expressed an opinion. That's against the law or something? Come on. We got things to do. Solly. We can handle it, if we go easy And work everything out To the last comma and decimal point. We all buy that. Let's move on. Wait a minute. You decided already? How about the vote? Dom. I say go. Jimmy? Okay. Frank? I vote no. Sol? And yes for me. Now, you want to discuss some more? Yeah, I want to discuss. I say we're grab bin' plenty of federal trouble We do this. You know, the government ain't gonna just sit around And let you stick 'em where it hurts the most. Yes, sir! Coming, Mr. Bertolo. Pop. What's up, Pop? Things ain't so good, Vinny. Frank? You think all these years, maybe you know, You understand somebody. You don't. I talk to him quiet, plain. I try to make him understand. You think it gets inside here? It don't. Everything the board comes up with now, it's no. No! Sol, Jimmy, Jake, huh? How long you think they gonna take That kind of stuff, huh? I'm tell in' ya... They had enough, especially after today. Up to here. Pop, you know Frank. Listen. We ain't play in' for matches here. We got new action to consider Almost every week. We gotta move. There's 10 hungry ones for every one of us, Ready to make the decisions if we don't. They could push him right out. He could lose everything. Yeah. And you, too. Me? Look, Vinny, you gotta understand something. You're Frank's brother. You're my son-in-law, so you had things Just the way you wanted all along. That's fine. I wish you the best. But with the board, that don't mean no thin' If they gotta push. I've been talk in' to a couple of 'em About... well, how you might button A part of this new electronics operation. I ain't said no thin' to Frank because... You know the way he's been. But now... Look, Vinny, if Frank don't see things right, You might have to make a decision To go out with him or come with us. Or maybe they don't even give you the decision. Maybe you go out with him just the same. What he does hurts you. See? It goes like that, Vinny, I can't help you. I can't help you at all. I want you to understand that. I want you to think about that when you talk to him. Okay? Yes. How's Emma? She's fine. And the kid? Fine. The wa... watermelon? Everything's all right. You call me after. Hear? I'll talk to him tomorrow. Today. Imbecile! Alla sinistra! Alla sinistra! Eh! Cafone! Cafone! Frank! Frank! Vinny. You see that lousy ball? Frank, it's 9:00. Can we go now? We're go in'! One minute! It's the last point! Hey, Frank... Ahh... Calma, calma. Right. Hey, Pete, explain it to these guys. Never against the wall! Commendatore, professore, dot tore. Frank! There you go, now. Vinny, sit down. Have a drink. Hey, we gotta play another one to decide. Frank, I told you, I've gotta talk to you. Ten minutes. Oh, right. Hey! 10 more minutes. I said forget it. For cry in' out loud, it's gonna kill ya? Hey, Vinny! Francesco! Hey, Mr. Ginetta. Yeah, look at you, a bunch of goof-off artists. Make like you're work in', huh? Hey! Hey, Willie!

And Mr. Peppino called. He leave a number? Yes. Get him back. Hi, Vinny. Hi. Hey... got it all laid out, huh? Mmm-h mm. That's good. How'd the game turn out last night? Aw, cut it out, will ya? Yeah? - Mr. Peppino. Okay. Don Peppino, come stai? Non c'e male. Mrs. Calidru wants to thank you For the money and the flowers. That was a good thing you do. What are you talk in' about? Forget it. Listen, Frank, you come to the funeral? Well, I don't know. I got a heavy schedule. I think you should come. It's going to mean a lot to the family. Sure, I'll be there. What time? 5:00. 724 Crotona. Okay. Addio, Frank, and grazie. So long. Frank... Yeah? Why do you hang around with those old guys up there? Hmm? I don't know. I like to hear the talk... Remember what it was like before all this. And they kinda remind me of Pop, the way he used to be. Yeah, but you get up there with them, You start talk in' Sigi and all that, And I don't know you anymore. That bothers you? I just don't understand What you've got go in' with them, that's all. Vinny, when we first come here From the old country, you couldn't pitch pennies Without which they say it's okay. You think I'm kid din'. New York, Chicago, Miami, they was it. The council... Capos of everything. You couldn't sit at the same table, not even Pop. And he was their number-one soldier. They done a lot for me when Pop got it. You ask Pete. Dom says things aren't so good between you and the board. Huh? He says you've been objecting To a lot of the new franchises and proposals. You know the kind of things they're comin' in with now? I tell you about the last vote they make? Frank, the electronics thing is good. If it's done slowly and carefully, We can't miss. Boy, I got another expert. Oh, they talk big, but, Vinny, there's some things which is too big, Like the government, for one. Frank, there's nothing too big, not even the government. Now, you can't keep operating out of a candy store! Candy store? Aetna wholesale flowers, Garibaldi importing, Cara produce, Ginetta coal and oil. What's this, peanuts? This is a candy store operation? The board is going ahead on the electronics thing. Now, you gotta move with them, or they're gonna move you. And not next month or next year, but now. Now, do I have to draw you a picture? You don't have to do no thin' but what I tell you. Oh, that's great. That's just great. Wonderful. And all along, I had the dumb idea we were do in' this together. Okay, you want to be il capo, fine, Frank, But I'm warn in' you... Wait a minute. You warn me?

You know you got out just in time, Vinny. That's some place. They got snakes over there, one bite, you're dead. Yeah. Malaria. Who can live in those jungles? Who'd want it? Carmela! You forgot there's dishes? For crying out loud, Carmela, What are you always fooling around for, you know? You're supposed to help your mother. Me? Well, you're the one... Yeah, you! Honey, she's calling you. I'll make her come. She's a hare-brained... There's a lot of work to be done. Well, it was his fault! Oh, sure, sure. You two get together, you forget about everything. Now, clear the table. I don't want to hear anything. Hey, Dom, I hear you been touting Vinny To work on the new electronics operation. Who told you that? What's the difference? It's true? Yeah. I'm sponsoring him. How come you don't say nothing to me about it? Huh? How come you don't say nothing? Look, Frank, I know how you feel about this thing, But I've got a big chance here, and if you'd just... You got nothing. Nothing. Understand? Frank, it ain't his fault. You stay out, huh? This is my house. I'm talking to my brother. You been doing enough. I want to know if you understand. Talking to you, Vinny. Did you forget what I told you In the office the other day? You never said you was going in this. You were told, Frank, a hundred times. A hundred ways. But, you're just not listening these days. I said I'm not putting myself on the line for your action. I said, the electronics thing made sense, And, I'm saying it again. Now, I'm gonna button for them if they let me, And Dom is sponsoring. Okay? You and him, you got it all figured out, The two of you, huh? Well, so what? I tell you so what. You ain't buttoning nothing. Because, that thing is gonna bust wide open, and I ain't letting you go in. Just forget it. I am, Frank. I am! Now, get it through your head! You think you can stay out of it and still call the shots? How're you gonna fight them? You don't like it, you want out, fine. But, you're not dragging me with you. You got guts, Vinny, really guts to do this to me. Do what? You sell me out. Nobody's sold you out! You were voted down! This is how we gonna work it out, huh? Well, I'm telling you now, I'm not gonna let you do this, Vinny. And, I'm telling you, I am. Now, just stop giving me orders. If they say yes, Frank, I move. With Dom and with them, whether you like it or not. The hell you are. And you got nothing to say about it. It's the board's decision and mine. Stop it! Oh... - Get him up. - Kids. Come on, let's get outta here. Vince... You gonna give me an argument? Take the kid and move! Now! That's supposed to be your brother, Frank. You forget? Frank... Don't say nothing. Don't... Open your mouth. You don't know what's going on here. You just don't know, Ida. L'onore mafiosa's finished a long time ago. What's the matter with you? You deaf? Or you don't listen? You forget what we used to be? Dominick put the finger on Pop. I can forget that? Never. Yeah? Don Francesco? Don Peppino? Don't forget. We are waiting. You have a job to do. We count on you. Sure. But you stay out of it. Give somebody else the contract, huh? This I gotta do. They're gonna find out. They'll find out. And, then? Then I take a little vacation in Sicily. I'm with you, Frank. Anything you want. Frank, only use the Fifth Amendment If things get rough. Now, this Kessler wants you bad, Especially on the loans of union funds. How are you fixed there? Frank! All right. How many times I gotta tell you? I arranged for a temporary loan From my dock local to balance it for now. Okay. Los Angeles has two good mechanics ready In case there's any heavy work to be done. Anything else? Okay, now we have this thing with Vince to go over. Dom? Yeah. Um... First thing is, uh... Everybody knows what's happened With you and your brother, Frank, and... With me. We all know. And, we gotta fix it up, Because, this kind of thing is no good For you and me and everybody. Second thing is, I say we should let Vince button for us. Vince is out. That's how we're gonna fix it up. Frank, the nature of this decision affects everybody. That's right, Sol. It affects everybody. It affects me, too, huh? So how come I gotta find out for myself? How come, huh? Because, I suggest we don't say nothing, Until we see what the hell you're gonna do next. You think I want to play these kind of games with you? You think anybody here wants to? We all gotta give you the special treatment. We gotta keep our mouths shut, because... You still got it in your mind You gonna do things your way, no matter what. Hmm? My fault, from the beginning. A bunch of baloney. Who are you, you should be so special? We ain't playing bocce here, paisan. Wait a minute, Dom. We just can't start pushing each other around. Frank. Look at what you have now. You get old, have your family, Clip your coupons, collect your rents. No more running. You pay your taxes, and you live safely. Why? Because every decision is made on the basis of More than the personal interests of just one man. I don't know if you realize just where Vince would fit And how important it would be And the amount of money involved. But, it is considerable. Now, Dominick has suggested... Dominick? Dominick? He's something, that guy. He suggests, he recommends, He gives information. He's the best in the world for that. That Sigi don't understand nothing. This is my brother, and I tell him what he can do. Not you, you camorrista bastard! Stop now, Ginetta! I think we'd better vote on Vince. That's fine. You vote. You vote all you want. But you ain't get tin' Vince. Now this is for me to say. I say no! No it's gonna be! Key target of Kessler's crusade, This Frank Ginetta, Alleged Cosa Nostra leader and union organizer. Ginetta will be questioned in connection With his activities in the policy rackets, Extortion, and labor manipulations throughout the east. Now, the Attorney General put it this way, "It's about time the public took a long, hard look" "At this patron saint of the working class." Kessler intends to review Ginetta's arrests, Suspicion of grand theft, suspicion of murder And assault with... Ain't you got homework to do? Papa... Is it true? What I got, another investigation here? What do you believe, that or what you got here? Who you believe? I ask you. Huh? Papa. Pop. Do your homework. Yeah? How's the eye? Okay. Frank, I just don't understand How you could blow it like that. Mmm. Dominick told you already, huh? Dominick is your friend. He's trying to help. Those other guys are ready to throw you out. Now, you gotta listen to me. This is real trouble. Trouble. Hmm. Trouble, he says. Ah, Vinny, you smart kid. College, everything. You don't understand nothing. You got your action with the electronics thing. Yes, that's all set. Well... You do what you want from now on. What are you gonna do? It's funny. You're just like I was... Don't listen to nobody, do what you want, tough. Lousy thing is, you can't fight no more, Vinny. You're a piece of furniture. The only thing now is the vote. That's all. The vote, h mm. Dom ain't taught you that part yet. What are you talk in' about? You know, in Sicily, when we want to make the bull fat, We take a knife and cut him So he's no good no more with a cow. He's no good for nothing. He don't fight, just gets fat. That's the vote, Vinny. That's crazy. Crazy, huh? You'll find out. Frank. Just call Dom, please. Vinny, honest to God, I'm really tired. Go home, huh? Well, then I'll call him. What do you want from me? I want you to talk to him. Leave it go. Huh? We gotta do something. Frank, please. All right. Tomorrow, I talk to Dom. You promise? Sure. Sure, I promise. Now, wait a minute. Let me say something. Well, you already said plenty. Too much. The boys are pretty mad, huh? What do you think? Dom, we gotta fix it up. Oh, "we." All of a sudden, now, it's "we." You're right. The kid's right. That's the way we gotta go. Well... we'd better talk. Okay, let's talk. Hey, did you eat yet? No. Listen, let's go up to Scarpati's. A little scampi, some clams. We ain't done that in a long time, okay? We eat, we straighten it out. You're crazy. Come on, I'm hungry. So am I. One minute, I'm ready to give you a shot. The next minute... Hey, Pete. You know, Dom, I can't figure it out. What makes a guy do things? You know, you get an idea in your head, It stays, it stays. No matter what, you can't change it. Yeah. I gotta change. Solly said it. We can't push each other around. Especially you and me. That's dumb. It's really dumb. It's really dumb. Oh, di', finalmente. That's the first right thing you said In a long time, Frank. Well. Hmm. Hey, drink? Hmm? Si. Grazie. Salute. Ah. Hmm? No. Hey Pete, I drink for you 'cause you're drivin', huh? Hmm. Ah, sometimes I think, Whatever happened to all them years? Mmm. Ah. These crazy things we did. Hey, you remember Benjy Miller? Hmm? No. Benjy Miller. Hey, Pete, you remember. Sure, from Bensonhurst. Yeah. Had a contract on him I'll never forget. He's the nervous type. You can't get near him. He don't trust nobody. So listen to this, Dom. I spent two weeks be in' his buddy. We were hop pin' around to all the bars. I'm spring in' for drinks, tryin' to find the best way to set him up. Now, all the while, I can't carry any iron, Because this one's really nervous. At the end of two weeks, I'm in. But really in. He wants to take me home and fix me up with his sister. That's how "in." Get this. It's all set up. We walk out of a bar on Washington Street, see? We pass a bunch of people. Pete slips me the .38. I keep walk in' my arm around him, jokin', laugh in'. I get him around to the side of the pier, see? I put the gun in his gut, pull the trigger, And click, click, click. Nothin'. His eyes are bug gin' out of his head look in' at me. I start to laugh. "Hey, you big gidrool, you see what a pushover you are?" What would've happened if I wasn't your friend, huh? "Oh, jeez, you're right," he says. "You're right. "I gotta be careful." We go back to the bar. Get this, Dom. I'm in the toilet with a fork, Workin' on that lousy gun. I'm go in' crazy. I'm cursin', I'm sweat in'. I get it fixed. We walk out of the bar again. Now I'm really in tight with him. The same pier, right in the same spot, And this time, bang! Bang! Bang! Three big ones right where he breathes. And you should've seen the look on his face... waah. Oh, those were some times, huh? Yeah. You said it. Yeah. You know, I got, Let's see, 460 fish for that. Twenty years old. Crazy. With those guys you could get for 100. Yeah. Fifty. Cowboy you right in church if you wanted. A regular shooting gallery. Yeah, you never knew when you were fingered or what for. A guy would rat on you for two cents. Yeah. Remember? Oh, yeah, right. I remember. Yeah. So do I, Fink. No... Forty one of them. Remember? "Giovanni Lippi." "Franco Lobello." "Eduardo Ruggerio." "Rafaello Luca." "Carlo Angelo." "Benvenuto Grisello." "Guiseppi Siragusa."

The organization thinks you deserve a chance Since you wasn't in on it. Me personally, I'd get the both of you. Don't goof, Vinny boy. You're on your own over there. You get out after, okay.
