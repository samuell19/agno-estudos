Dear students. Do you know what makes a good movie? It takes hard work. Great sacrifices. Then God willing, your movie will turn out good. Your final project is important. If you do well, you might get into a good production company, and get to learn from great directors.

This is a classroom, not a playground. Look at me. Quit being lazy. Wake up. Understood. Yes, Professor. Think you're so gorgeous, eh? Forever daydreaming. Sivar. Go home if you want to sleep. This is a classroom, for learning. Hello. You think this is a wet market? We are in class, my lecture. Pay attention. Sit down. "Fighting." "Fighting." Do you understand? We understand. Hey, guys. Is it true? We can't graduate if we fail the final project? But I've told my mom the graduation date. We shouldn't underestimate ourselves. Because, the hall is under renovation. We just need to make a good movie. I have an idea. Don't you know? What do you mean? It's 2019, there's no more originality. Just pick a favorite movie, copy the plot, and modify it. What do you think? It'll work. Yes, agreed! Awesome. We'll graduate. We can learn the art direction. As long as we stick together, we can do better than this. I have been waiting. We are the future of the film industry. We, the new generation, must revolutionize. Starting with our horror movies. Why so many clichés? Why don't they just get out of a haunted house? Why? Why must doors creak? Why? And behind the door there must be ghosts. Yet, people still walk in. Why? Do you know why? Why must characters fall and get hurt when escaping? Why? Clichés. And when they turn around there's a ghost there. Why such clichés? We will be the next horror masters. For graduation, for movies. Okay, Linda, ready. Wait. Just look scared, okay. Yes, scared. One more. -Make me look slimmer. -Sure. Don't shoot my side profile. You are slim. Linda. One "Ho" is enough. Enough! Don't scream at me. I can’t act when I see your face. Are you ready? Linda, not enough. You still can't act, even after I put a mask on. It's not my problem. It's you. You're not scary at all. Make some moves. Strangle me. Or slap me, don't you know how? Do it properly. This is serious. Wait, let me warm up. I did great, right? This is what I've been telling you. Art of acting. Superb, right? Let's see. I got it. Found it. Let me see. This is what we need. Well… Scary or not? It looks creepy! What if there are ghosts? The internet says it's haunted. Should we still go? Of course. Why, you scared? We don't have a choice. If there's a ghost, we'll just get it on camera. In that case, what are we waiting for? Let's go. Microphone. Tripod. Is this lighting? Lock the door. -Linda. -Yes. I bought some snacks. What would you like? Marshmallows? Never mind, I'm on a diet. Does anyone have a tissue? Oh, so dirty. Sivar, do you have a tissue? It's in my bag. Amir. Ever since we started university you've always been staring at me. I know I'm gorgeous, but enough is enough. I'll dig your eyes out if you continue. Don't be so vain. Vain? Woah! Who brought these? Put those back. I just wanted tissues. Why did you bring those things? Wait, incoming call. Sorry, it's dirty. Hello. Yes. What? Are you serious? Got it, we're arriving soon. What's up? Oh no, another team is making a horror movie too. Using the same location as ours. Great, then we can cancel. No way, we must make it before them. If we finish first, then they are the copycats. Yang Guo, drive faster. Got it? Looks creepier than in the photos. Scary or not? What did I say. Once at the haunted house, the camera will slowly zoom in, with scary music. Isn't it always like that? If not that, do you want to do a dancing entrance? Why not. Scary or not. Peace be upon you. -Hello? -Yang Guo, help me with this. Yang Guo, open this. I was sucked in. Did you feel it? Yeah, that gust of wind was strange. Look at this house. Just like the haunted houses in movies. Agreed. Come on, let's start shooting. Abbas, I'm not ready yet. Hurry up. Amir, set up the camera. We shoot the break up scene first. Linda, Sivar, you guys rehearsed, right? Yeah, but Linda kept messing up her lines. No way. I won't mess up when shooting. Come on and set everything up. Especially my Director's Chair. Please… Don't leave me. I can't live without you. Me too. But… I can't disobey my parents. I have to agree with their decision. But… But… I told you, Linda always messes up. Linda. The line is, "We are destined to be a couple." We are destined to be a couple. Stay focused. -Less movement, please. -What? Less movement, I can't focus. Please… Don't leave me, I can't live without you. Me too. But… I can't disobey my parents. I have to agree with their decision. But we're destined to be a couple. Why obey your parents, instead of me? Why did you change the lines? It's not in the script. Where? Here, your line, my line. Just follow. Hurry. Please… Don't leave me, I can't live without you. Who's calling me? Linda. You flubbed your lines twice. No, it's not that. I heard someone call my name. Sivar, did you hear anything? Just admit your mistake. Don't make excuses. Hurry up, I want to go home early. Hurry. Linda, last take, okay? Okay? Let's not lose to the other team. Speak louder, please. Okay. Hurry. Please… I can't live without you. What's wrong with you? I heard someone calling Linda's name. I told you I wasn't lying. The voice came from there. I told you, right? Amir. Let's check it out. Camera, keep rolling. Follow me. In here? Sivar. Do you hear anything? Nothing. Did you get that? You didn't say roll. You're supposed to keep rolling. We'll change scenes. Change to this room. Linda, interact with the wardrobe, please. How do I interact, hug it? It called you, so say something. Say something? Who are you, what do you want? Anything? Nothing. Try asking something else. Like what? Whatever. Okay, I know, I know. I know you can see me. You think I'm pretty, right? Reveal yourself, it's okay. What are you doing? Be serious. Serious? You're the scriptwriter, give me the line then. Just ask, how they died. Were you murdered? Like that, understand? Okay, understood. How did you die? Were you-- Did you get it? You didn't say roll. If you want to shoot, you must say roll. These people are really testing my patience. Come out! What are those? Why are the photos all headless? Don't touch that doll. Don't just touch things when you're in someone's house. Don't touch what's not yours. So, what should I do? Put it back. Properly. And lock it. Leave it now. Quickly. I told you, don't just touch things. Put it back, hurry! I have something to say. No more fooling around. Ghosts are real. This house has ghosts. Did you pray before entering this house? Did you ask for permission to be here? We know, we didn't ask for permission. Yang Guo. If bad things happen, who will take responsibility? I don't want to play anymore. From now on, be serious. Follow me. We apologize now. Understood. I told you to apologize, what are you doing? What? Die! Die! Die! Do not touch, do not disturb. We leave now. Sivar, your microphone. Go get it. Don't be scared. Take it, Sivar. This house is really creepy. We can shoot a lot here. We've got to hurry up. But because of you, we got nothing. Are you done blaming me? What's the time now? Uh… -It's half past ten. -Half past ten? Oh no, I'm late. Where'd you get that? At the pharmacy. You still care about that in this situation. Linda, you too. The two of you are a match made in heaven. Match made in heaven… Come on, hurry up. I know. The other team must have arrived to prank us. Did you realize, it's like everything's been set up, with hidden cameras to record our reactions. Like a reality show. I know, right? I have to touch up my makeup. If so, we hide, and fight back. Find a place to hide and take revenge. -Right here. -Right here? We wait here. I'm sure someone or something will move. Okay… There, there, right there! See, look. I bet there's someone pulling a string. Can't get it. Stand up. And zoom in. Same old trick. This one I know. Must be someone pushing from behind. We are not dumb. It's a hand. I know, this is special effects. Hey, stop acting. I wasn't acting. How is it that a hand can slap me from there? Here it goes again. -What's going on? -What's that? -There are scratches. -What? Director. How is it that the hand is there, but I got scratched here? I don't think we're being pranked. And how did the doll appear on my back just now? Yeah, yeah. The hand walked like a spider. Did you get it? Of course. Let's check the playback. Hey, when did the battery die? How do I know. How can this be? Maybe we shot for too long. You said you love long takes, how come you're so bad at it? Enough, guys! Like I said, this house is haunted. Listen to me. I think we should stop shooting. Our lives are in danger. I want to go home. Don't overreact. We must finish the movie. No. What's more important, life or the movie? Exactly, bro. Don’t be stupid like horror movie characters. You know it's haunted, but you still want to stay in the house. Right. Let's go home. Let's go. Stop! Don't you want to finish the movie anymore? Don't you want to graduate? We'll vote. Those who want to leave, raise your hands. Why is it so dark? This is where we came from. Didn't you say you want to leave? Leave now. Did you hear that? Keep recording. What? You still want to record in this kind of situation? You're really stubborn. We are shooting a horror movie. Horror movies are-- Stop talking, just keep going. Hurry up. Guys, guys. We've walked so far, but still can't reach the exit. Are we still in the house? Now I know why characters in movies don't escape. Because there's really no way out. The scriptwriters are innocent. Are we really being pranked? Make some calls. Alright, hang on. Shhh! No signal, check yours. Nope. Do you guys know why I am timid? Why? Why I always bring along religious items? That's because I've seen a ghost before. It was dark, I was walking to the shop. I heard someone calling me from behind. Si-Var… I turned around, and saw a head rolling off its body. It's true. What's more, the head talked. What did it say? It said… "Did my mom call?" Did my mom call. What was that? A joke? Whatever, let's start walking to find the next exit, okay? -Alright. -Alright. Okay, let's go. We don't have a choice. Hurry. Wait. I think we were here just now. Keep walking. Oh, my god. Quick, open it. Do you guys realize the five of us are like movie characters. If you're right, then the plot has to be about us and how we escape from this house. This type of horror movie… Normally, how do they end? Normally, we either all die, or we end up killing each other. Actually, according to internet, those who entered this house never returned. Like the Bermuda Triangle. Why didn't you tell us sooner? You could get us killed. I thought they were just rumors. What are you saying? Exactly like this. This is a typical trick. The door will open itself, then we will go inside, and get killed one by one. Not all horror movies are like this. Sometimes there's a good ghost. Maybe there's a pretty ghost waiting for us. Amir, why are you horny all the time? I don't care, I'm not going in. This is typical too. The dialogue you just said. Don't you know? In such movies after the characters separate, then they will… Die, one by one. Do we have a choice? I'm going inside. Maybe there is someone prettier than you inside. Nobody is prettier than me. Amir. Amir, Amir. Master scriptwriter. Now we are here, what's next according to a typical plot? Typically, after the main characters enter, the door will shut by itself. And then? Next… "The Ring." Yang Guo. Help me. Huh, what did she say? She… wants me to help her. Finally… there's really someone prettier than you here. Are you human or a ghost? I'm not so sure myself. Just like you, I'm trapped in this house. After going through that tunnel, I couldn't leave. Quit lying. Long hair, white dress, bare feet. You must be a ghost. You said you need our help. All this started from my past life. I was Korean. And I fell in love… with a man. Please don’t leave me, I can't live without you. Me too. But I can’t disobey my parents. I'm sorry, I can't control my destiny. I'll see you in my next life. Who do you think you are? You're not qualified to marry my son! Mother. My dear. See you in my next life. So, have you found your lover? Maybe, he's right here in this room. Yes. As I said, we're destined to be together. So, who is he? Him? You must be wrong. Maybe your memories are wrong. You, I remember who you are. You were one of the guards who beat me up. My dear. And you… You were Yang Guo's pet goat. My dear. Goat. Don't believe what a ghost says. I won't forget you. You were Yang Guo's fiancee, in his past life. My dear. Good. No matter in a past life or this life, you're not my competition. You won't get Yang Guo. Linda. What about me? Since childhood, my-- First love, perfect match. Pet tortoise, that I had since I was young. You've been here a long time, right? You should be familiar with this place. How come you don't know the way out? I was trapped here. When I woke up, I found myself in this house. Maybe I was destined to meet you here. Are we here for a vacation? Looking for a way out, right? Hurry up. She's insecure, because you're prettier than her. I don't know anything. I didn't see anything. You really saw nothing? I swear, nothing. If you leak this secret, I will kill you all. Alright, I won't say a word. I only want that young man to break the curse. And then, I will be free. Then… Then the rest of you will be able to leave. But, who are you really? I don't love you anymore. I have another lover. Don't touch me. Isn't that the same story? Not the same. It is different! He never loved me. A woman in love, is always young and beautiful. A woman with hatred is hideous. Do you understand? Understood. I want to be loved. I don't want to be ugly. I want to leave this place. Do you understand? Please don't be angry. Can you change back to your pretty face? If you want me to, you must make me happy first. What do you want me to do? I have not laughed for a long time. Sing to me. It would make me happy. Happy birthday to-- It is my 20th death anniversary. Why do you sing Happy Birthday? Never mind. If you dare to leak our secret, I will kill you all. Do you understand? You look like you're angry with her. I don't want to talk to you. Oh, here they are. Where did you go? We've been waiting for a long time. Just now, I saw… Just now I went to the toilet, and got lost. Luckily she found me. And brought me here. I see. Come. Sit down. You guys have been here for a while. You must be hungry. Let me prepare some food. Yes, we're starving. Thank you. I want to tell you guys something important. Sivar. Can you help me in the kitchen? Let me do it. No, I think Sivar is most suitable to help me. Right, Sivar? Hey, you. Don't you get it? She's my lover from a past life. So, don't you even try, huh? Sambal Tumis and Roti Canai. Pretty face and good cooking skills. Perfect candidate for a wife. Please help yourselves. Let's eat. Eat whatever you want. Let's eat. What's wrong, Sivar? Is there a problem? No. Eat this, curry puff. Why aren't you eating? Do you want me to feed you? My dear, feed me please. Feed me too. My dear, feed me first, I'm hungry. I'm starving! I'm starving. This curry puff tastes different. Tastes awesome! Such a sweet talker. Who else wants to be fed? Me, my dear! What? Feed me. What are you doing? She put a lot of effort into those. Don’t waste food. Faster. Say sorry. Don't worry, I have another half here. Wait. Am I the only one who sees this? There's something wrong with the curry puff. Look properly. Wrinkled. Pale, not golden brown. Since everyone says it's so good. Too greasy. But the stuffing is good. Are you okay? I sprained my ankle. Nope, here. Feel better? Your hand is soft. When you massage my leg like that, it reminds me of our good old days together. You were always so good to me. Do you know? Really? Anything else I can do to help you bring those memories back? Yeah. You can… Kiss me. My dear. My dear. I remember now. I need my memories too. Can you kiss me? Of course… Not. No kisses. Touching hands will do too. My memory is back. Be careful. What happened? My ankle is hurting more and more. I don't know why. I need someone to massage my leg. Let me do it. It's there. My skills are better than Yang Guo's, right? The kiss was sweet, right? That was quick. Let me massage your other leg. I know you already saw the real me. No need to use the mirror anymore. Sivar! I warned you. Look what you've done. I will kill you all. Sivar. What did you promise her? Run! Linda, are you okay? I sprained my ankle. What should we do? So it's true that ankles will get sprained running away from ghosts. Die! You think this is a movie? This has no effect on me. Now, let me show you my real evil power. Look at you five, like puppets. Makes me feel so happy. Okay. Enough for now. Anyone have water? No water, but I have this. Have this first. My whole life, no one has ever slapped me, not even my parents. I've never been bullied so badly. I told you she was evil. You refused to listen to me. You'd rather be obsessed with her. I don't know. I felt like, I was bewitched. Me too. I think, I lost my mind. Lost control. I didn't. I never lose my mind. I'm always with you, Linda. I know. That ghost is too much. If I see her again, I will beat her up with all my might. Are you sure? What are you waiting for? Come on. I've been wanting to beat you up for a long time. Harder and harder. Harder and harder. My whole life too, no one had beaten me like this, not even my parents. Linda. Have you really wanted to beat me up for a long time? Guys, I'm so tired. This really is like a horror movie. She can suddenly appear and disappear. What should we do now? She's playing with us. Like a cat with a mouse. I wish this was a movie. Then when the sun comes up, or when we wake up from our sleep this nightmare would end. Dream? Yes. What if we take a nap? Then all this will just be a dream. Yes. Usually this is how horror movies end. Why don't we do it? Let's sleep. I'm so tired anyway. Yes, let's get some sleep. When we wake up later, it will all be a dream. Let's sleep. Then we'll wake up and everything will be fine. So, you are all hiding and sleeping here? What happened? Why so many ghosts? All the stories that I told are lies. Past life, present life and romance. Are all nonsense. This house was a mental asylum. One night, there was a big fire and we were all killed. That’s why, we are trapped here. If that is the true story. Why is it always changing? Isn't this what you do best? Forever changing the storyline. Filmmakers like you, making stories up with illogical twists. True that. But what do you really want? As I told you, we want you to replace us. Why did you wake me up? Didn't you say everything will be fine after a sleep? Why has it become worse? They said, they want us to replace them. I don't want to, I don't want to! Sivar. I'm sorry. I came here to shoot, without your permission. But we have no bad intentions. Please, let us go. Don't be dramatic. If you want to leave you have to beg my Granny. What, another granny? Scary or not. They bullied me. I don't like you. And you. These two are the worst. I heard that you all want to leave. Follow me, if you want to leave this place. I will take you out of here. You and you, come. Hurry up and follow! If you want to survive, we have no choice. Don't hesitate, follow me. Actually, this house was a mental asylum. Burned down in a fire. They all turned into ghosts. That's why they all look crazy. So we'll be as crazy as them. Get crazy together. If you want to leave, follow me. Harder. I've never seen a movie plot like this. From human ghost to tiger ghost. I'm doing this for everyone. Eat this. Faster. Take it, and eat. Eat. Eat more. Enough. I don't want to eat. You'd better just kill me. I thought you wanted to play. Because you were too bored. If you don't want to play, it means you want to die instead. Faster. Wait, my shirt is hooked. Faster. I'm tired. My ankle hurts, go on, leave me. I can't run anymore. Heroes in movies never leave their friends behind. So, we won't abandon you either. But I will slow you down. Just go without me. Watch movies together, and make movies together. If we die, we die together. That's right. We took exams together, we cheated and failed together. If we become ghosts, we will do it together. Become ghosts? Why don't we dress up like ghosts? And become scarier than them. Become a ghost? Which movie did you learn this from? Sivar, this is a brilliant idea. But how do we do it? -We brought makeup and costumes, right? -Yeah. Wait here, I'll go get them. Take this, crazy ghosts. I'm the greatest Sumatran Dukun. I ruled all Southern evils and demons. This is my army. It worked. We did it. Sivar. We must leave now. Run! We finally made it back out. It's all over. We survived. Sivar, thank you! Our acting was great, right? I saw him floating in the air. But Sivar did it best. His body was floating in the air. How did you do that stunt? I really can levitate. Because, I'm a real ghost. What do you mean? If I didn't do it, we would never have been able to escape. You guys wait here, I'll go get it. They are my best buddies. I want to keep them safe. Just kill me. You are willing to sacrifice yourself for your friends? Yes. I like this kid. He is willing to sacrifice for his friends. He loves his friends and is loyal to them. Do you all remember? I was trying to rescue you all from the fire. In the end, I sacrificed my life for you. Remember? So now, are you ready to die? I shall grant you your wish. Abbas. You know, filmmaking is tough. You're a good director… Amir… …and I'm sure one day the world will see your talent. Yang Guo, you don't need makeup. Linda, you're smart, you're brave, and I know Abbas likes you very much. Give him a chance. Stop being dramatic, come back inside. Leave, leave this place. Before she changes her mind. Sivar! Sivar! We watch movies together, and make movies together. That's right. We took exams together, we cheated and failed together. Sivar. Thanks to you, the audience. This is the work of our five best students. I don't know why they asked me to do this, but it is funny, right? Well, I would like to thank YB for your honorable presence. Let me proudly present our five best students. Hello everyone, thanks for watching our movie. I would like to thank my team. Amir, our master cinematographer. Sivar, our soundman and art director. Yang Guo, our outstanding scriptwriter. Linda, our actress and brilliant producer. And myself, the director of this movie. We all love movies, and are passionate about filmmaking. Making a great movie is our dream. Where's your mom, you told her the date, right? She's not here. What? As you saw, this is our work. We thank you Professor, for your guidance and advice. -Hello, is this Sivar's Professor? -Yes, speaking. This is Sivar's mother. Sivar passed away this morning, and left a note. What? What? He's on the stage right now. What do you mean Professor? I'm not kidding, he's really dead. What was in the note? It says: I have to leave first, to fulfill my promise, so my friends can live. What's wrong with you, are you okay? YB, did my mom call?
