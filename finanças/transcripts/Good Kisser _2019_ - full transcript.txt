Jenna? Yes, thank you for waiting. Music okay? Yeah, it's fine. You hate classical. It's okay. I'm so glad we're doing this. You still want to, right? Right? Okay. Oh, I forgot to get the gum you wanted. Oh my God, I asked for one thing. Plus the gum, you mean? It's okay, I'll get it when we stop for wine. Oh, I forgot to put it in the app but could you stop at the liquor store? It's like two blocks up on the right. Got it. Babe, you have to tell those things before, to drivers. It's gonna cost more money now. Sorry. It's okay, I'm nervous too. I'll be right back. That dog's tied up outside that cafe every night. She looks lonely. No matter how long they're tied up and waiting, dogs forget all about it as soon as their person comes back. Do you have a dog? Can't afford a dog. Yeah, me neither. Plus, my girlfriend's allergic. Doing anything fun tonight? If I don't throw up first. Why is that? We are going on a date with another woman. Splurged and got the wine from Moldova. Mmmm. She'll love this. Sorry, it's kind of hot back here. Did you get the gum? Yeah. It's crazy how hot it is and the leaves are falling. Shit. Hang on a second! Just a second! I told you we'd be late. What? I'm on my way. I can feel my nervous breath pushing right through the gum. - Hi. - Hey. Come on in. How's it going? Good, hi. I hope you like it. Mmmm. The Moldova we talked about. Cheers. Unless we all want to fall into my bed right now. I thought we'd share some wine. Yes. We could all change our minds too. We're all in or we're not, right? Thank you for saying that, I'm a little nervous. Make yourselves at home. It's not my home, it's my friend, Daniel's, but he's like a brother to me, so. Your gum. Kate, can you put some music on? Do you have to look so happy? I don't. I hope you don't mind if I bring nuts to the party. Brilliant. Brilliant. Oh. Wine. Let me get it. Can you grab an opener too? What? It's in the drawer. No? Cheers. Yeah. Is your AC still out? Sadly. I'm trying to get the landlord to fix it but he hasn't called me back. I thought you said this was your friend, Daniel's, place. Oh, someone takes care of it. The tenant in the back is supposed to. Not the landlord, I meant the... Maintenance person? Yes. Let me. They call them caretakers in England, I got this. I feel like I'm never gonna be cool again. Well, we'll turn the fan on upstairs. Plus, we have ice. Kate told me you live in London but do I hear Welsh in your voice? She's not lying. Four years in Wales. Good ear. Did you grow up there? And Michigan, Texas, San Diego, France and Macedonia all before 18. An army brat. Mom's a Lieutenant Colonel. Is that above a General? No, it's Specialist, Corporal, Sergeant, Warrant Officer, 2nd and 1st Lieutenants, Captain, Major, Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel, General. Wait, what about Private? Oh, that's a starter rank, everyone gets it. There are a lot of Lieutenants. Is your mom retired now? Hey, this isn't an interview. She died four years ago, so, pretty much. Mine too. Mine had a heart attack in her garden. Could've been worse. Embolism on a plane. My mom's still alive. Still married, my parents. It's funny, sometimes I still pick up the phone to call her. Hmmm. Coat hook by the door, remember? I'm gonna try that again. Yeah. Was it hard for you? Must be the thermostat on this thing. Kate says you're working on a novel. She's been doing that for like two years. I have 15 chapters and a decent second draft but I just cannot get the protagonist, you know, emotionally. Like, the plot's totally working... What's her name? The protag. Barb Harrison. Barb. Barb. What? The name's a statement. Like "Rock." Yeah. Yeah. But she's a soft rock. You hate it. No. I'm just thinking. I'm trying to subvert a name that might make someone think of a middle class housewife cheerfully devoted to her family. My grandma's name was Barb. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. What's she like? She's devoted. And an alcoholic. Yeah, I think she had to be. Ouch. Just based on what I've heard. Success! Magic hands. Wow. You have a lot of science fiction. Oh, those aren't mine. Here. These are mine. These are all Daniel's books. I travel so much, I only carry two at a time. Yes, Kate said that you are going to Hawaii in two weeks. Actually one week. But I thought it was two. My surfing lesson, remember? Oh my Gosh, I could never surf. I would break my neck, drown the first day out. You could try boogie boarding. Still fun. You like Leguin. Yeah, she's one of my favorites. Hey, can you believe how hot it's been? Like super hot. I have to pee. I love this book. Have you finished it yet? Still making my way through. I've read it twice. There were so many things that I missed the first time. Does that happen to you? There's this thing that I like to do. I close my eyes... and... pick. It's... It's kinda like reading a tarot card for the day. "When they realized they only had enough fuel "to last the week, "they wrote notes to their families "and to their gods, "after which they felt a wave of relief, "euphoria even, "and they spent their last days dancing, "making love, "and planting the poppy seeds." So? Well, first of all, it reminds me of the "Awakening." And, I mean, the sense of relief after making an impossible decision. Having a say in what happens to you. Even when the choices suck. Hey. You guys want water? Sure. Yeah. So, what tarot card would that be? What you read. The Two of Swords. Yeah, I need to start making money. Like, you know, good money. Here you go. Make it to Hawaii sooner rather than later. Real estate's picking up you said, yeah? I mean, it's better than bartending, sure. But I still have to split commissions for the next couple of months with three people. I'm slated to make a million dollars in the next five years though. Cooperate leasing. Mm-hmm. Sorry, it's not very sexy. You're always sexy. Oh, I remembered, I have to call my sister back. You know how she gets. Her sister is really passive aggressive. Are you sure Jenna's into this? Yeah, of course. She even said how beautiful you are. She's just self-conscious. She's afraid you won't be into her. I am though. Really? Mmmm. She's hot. Yeah. Well done. I mean, you're hot. Good evening. Oh. Hi, good evening. My name is Clark. This is Jingles. Hi, Jingles. Are you all right with dogs? I love dogs. Can I pet her? Oh, absolutely. Hi, Jingles. Don't know what I'd do without her. Awww. Between her and my nightly medicinal, I'm all set. What's your nightly medicinal? Every night before nine I have my Negroni. That's Gin, Campari and Vermouth? A wonderful thing. Oh, I hate Campari. I wish I liked it, it's such a pretty color. Known Mia long? None of my business. I'm just amazed she can stay anonymous the way she does. Gotten good at it, I guess. I don't understand. She's still down to earth. I appreciate that. Y'all enjoy yourselves. Goodnight. Come on, sweetie. Does Jenna like to dance? Mm-hmm. Okay, remember what I taught you? Kind of. This foot goes... Forward, step, together, step. Forward, step, together, you're getting it. Okay, now, put your hand behind your back. Okay. Follow me. Oh. Not very fair to your girlfriend. All right. I just met your neighbor with the little dog. Clark. He seems to like you a lot. Terrific guy. Yeah. That fling that you had with the rocker when you met Kate at the hotel bar, I would love to hear the whole story. Oh. Well... I was at her show and I was standing right in the front and I couldn't take my eyes off of her. I thought maybe she was looking at me too but I couldn't be sure. And then afterwards, I was outside stuffing my face with a burrito and suddenly she was there and she recognized me from the show and she asked me to go back to her hotel for a drink. Just like that? Just like that. Who is she? I can't say. Come on. I promised her. I couldn't stick to that. So did you go in the same car? A cab. and she put her hand on the seat next to me, like this. And then she moved closer so that her right thigh was touching my left. And I was shaking. I was so fucking exciting to be near her. Then what? Then... She put her hand on my leg. And I looked at her and I put my hand on hers. And then she kissed me. Very lightly. On just my bottom lip. Just the bottom? She was an incredible kisser, do you know what I mean? I do. When we first kissed, I never wanted it to end. And your chemistry with her was so amazing, it's like when you walked into the room, it's like a slow motion tornado or something. The whole room stopped. And then you made her a dirty martini. And your gin and tonic. Oh my God, of course, you know who the rocker is. I mean, she looked a little familiar but I didn't actually know who she was. No, you do. But I promised I wouldn't tell. But it's me. If you wanna break a promise, that's up to you. No. What happened after cocktails? I'm gonna get some matches. Hey, babe, I feel so dorky. I don't think that I can do this. Let's just wait for a little while, okay? If you feel bad then you can go. By myself? I meant, we can go. Like, both of us. Okay. I think I have some nut skin in my teeth so I'm gonna just take care of that. - Hey. - Hi. You're funny. There you are. Can you guys light some candles? Sure. I'm gonna put some birdseed in the thingy. I love you. Your lips look nice. Shit! Oh, let's get it under water. Go, go, go, go. Let's get it under water. Oh my God, this is my good hand. Yeah but it's fine, give it a second. It's not helping. All right, all right. Oh God, I'm so nervous. There's so many things. It's fine, you're ambidextrous. It's okay. That's not even what I'm worried about. Are you okay? What if I can't... Stop. You're as sexy as butter. You can't even eat butter. No but I wish that I could. Such a good kisser. Better than Mia? I don't know, we're about to find out. I'm sure she can't compare. Kate, I just... I feel like something is off, so I just wanted to ask. Have you... What? Have I what? What if I can't orgasm? I can't relax with new lovers. The first couple times I'm so self-conscious. I know, I remember. Yeah. You didn't orgasm our first time either. I did. Oh really? Mm-hmm. I was just quiet. I made lasagna if you're hungry. Thanks but I have guests. I saw one of your guests earlier, that's why I thought you might be hungry. They'll be gone in the morning. If you want, I can help you with your work then. Good luck to you, darlin'. Thank you, goodnight. Maybe you can help make it happen. That's brilliant. Not now, not now. She could be back any minute. Isn't that the point? No. Okay, listen, when we're in there and she's working on me and I'm enjoying it but I just know that I'm not gonna get there. I have an idea. What about a safe word? Like a "Kate takes over" safe word. Yes, perfect, okay. "Heaven," I'm gonna say, "Heaven." "Heaven." Okay, how many times? Like a couple times, three times, four times? My mind is not gonna be working well in there, so I say "Heaven" any number of times and you come in and take over and get me there, okay? Wouldn't it make more sense if we said "Limbo?" No, that's not very flattering. You can count on me. That's a cute little dish. Got it in Thailand. God, I wish I could travel the world. But I would definitely end up kidnapped or dysentery. Probably both. There's a really lovely cross breeze upstairs. Plus, we can put the fan on. Go. Just through here. Oh. Hey, Kate, look it's gentle moss. Our kitchen's the same color. Yeah. Awww. Oh, come on. Clark has one job. This house is falling apart. Never mind. Excuse me. Okay. Hey. Should we go play "Spin the Bottle" downstairs? - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh, tequila. Body shots, that will cool you right down. Awesome. How exactly do you do that? Have you guys never done this together? No, definitely not. Okay, so, I am going to lick you on the neck right here and then I'm gonna salt you. Oh my Gosh, I'm so sweaty, I hope you can't smell. And then I'm gonna lick all the salt off the area. Then take a shot, then bite the lime. Ready, babe? Yeah. Wait, what was the last part again? Okay, I'm gonna lick you, salt you and lick you, shot, lime. - Ready? - Okay. Uh huh. Okay. Oh, that makes me dizzy. It's in my shirt. I'll get it late, don't worry. All right. - Cheers. - Cheers. Lime off, babe. Do it. Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm. Spin the bottle? Good idea. All right. Da, da, da, da, da, da, daaa. Go. Hello. Perfect. Are you hot? Yeah. Do you need some ice? Ice would be amazing. Hey, are you having fun? Yes. I am. I'm having a great time. I don't wanna go home. Good. Only one ice cube left. Terrible host. Would you go get some more? All right. It's at the gas station just down the street. I know. Back in a jiff. Thank you. You feeling all right? I'm feeling great just really hot. I will definitely help. You just need to put it at your points. Do you want me to show you before this melts? Yeah. Let's go outside. Okay. Oh, here you go. You need to get it on the points. Here. Wrist. Wrist. Neck. Wanna try? Mm-hmm Oh. Oh my goodness, let me do it. You're gonna get heated up again with all that movement. Wrists. Neck. I can't pay attention to two women at once. You guys have been together a year, yeah? Almost two. Just pay attention to me then. All right. Where'd you guys meet? At the laundry mat. She gave me a dryer sheet. Hard to come by. They're like stamps, you know? Every time I need a stamp I'm like, "Why don't I have any stamps." And then I borrow one and I forget all about stamps. Amnesia of the mundane. I only remember things that don't matter. It might matter. You can't really know. Come dance with me. I don't want to step on your little toes with my big boots. Take 'em off. Okay. Did you know that moons can have moons and they're called "moon moons." Here. Are you worried about Kate? You're sweet. Listen, if we all end up in a daisy chain foot rub, I'll be happy. I don't expect sex. Doesn't matter one bit. I'm so attracted to you. I didn't think that I would be but... I am. You've done this before, right? Which part? Can I take your hair down? Sure. I just wanna see how it moves. Beautiful. Do you want me to read your palm? Since you like tarot, you'd probably like that. Yeah. Yeah. Scoot in. You're right-handed, yeah? Mostly. Our dominate hand tells us about our past experiences and what we'll do. And our passive hand tells us about the traits and tendencies we were born with. What do they say about food allergies? Oh. What? Your heart line has a couple of wild forks in it and they intersect with the life line. Does that mean I'm gonna die young? I'm never gonna finish my book. No, it means that you are unpredictable in love and the lifeline doesn't talk about how long you live. It's about how you live. Oh, that feels really good. Yeah? Ow. God. I burned myself lighting the candle. Oh, shit, I'm sorry. It's okay, I forgot about it. Amnesia. I hope you don't forget that. Hey. I was just looking at her pour, sour finger. Yeah, she's ambidextrous, it's fine. Thanks for the ice. You feeling better? Yeah. Brought you something. Oh, my favorite popsicles. You're the best. I thought there'd be more food here but I don't think she has a lot of money. We should've brought a dish. What, like a potluck? We're the pots. True. Should we go get more comfortable? Sure. Kate, can you grab the tequila? Yeah. Let's play a game. I love games. So, let's go around and each tell a story. Something about our childhood or something that happened at college or at work. Something not mundane. Tidbits. And then the other two people get to ask two questions about it. Okay. Mia, you go first. Let's make it something like the first time we all did something. Mmmmm. You just drank. Does that mean that you've had a lot of threesomes? Babe, this isn't "Never Have I Ever." I'm just drinking to drink. Right. Right, right. Okay, so, the first time I had a physical fight. I had just moved to Texas and there was a boy in my class and he was such a bully. He destroyed my science project. So I followed him into the bathroom and I punched him in the face. You punched someone in the face? I was mad. Besides, I had just moved to that school. If I didn't do something, I would've been mincemeat. What happened next? So he pushed me and pinned me down to the ground and lucky a teacher came in and ripped him off me. How old were you? Eleven. And what was your science project? It was a model of the moon made out of sugar cubes. So, a square moon? Hmmmm. Did you get into a lot of fights? That was two questions. Fine. Your turn. Okay. Let's see. Oh, I was in high school, my first job. I was cleaning offices from five to nine. One of them was like a dentist's office and, you know those like nitrous masks they put over your face? My best friend and I would put it on and get so high. Whoa, I never knew about that. You could've died. Definitely could have, yes. What was it like? I mean, it was kind of like floating, hopeful. Kinda felt like it was like being in love. And then you stole those mini toothpastes that they give out to kids. Yes. How do you know about that? Oh, we talked about it in the bar. Hmmm. Well do you know about the rings? You know how dentists give out those toys or whatever when they fill kids cavities? Like, they have the big jewels on them? I took a bunch of those. Why? I don't know. Thought they were pretty, I guess. Maybe it was revenge for me having braces my whole life or something. You should be thankful you had braces because now you have such perfect teeth. Jenna would never steal anything. Too honest. You say it like it's a bad thing. I just don't like feeling guilty. Even if I go into a store and the aisle's empty, I feel guilty. Because you think you'll get away with it. I don't know. Catholic school just made me feel guilty for existing. All right, Jenna, your turn. Okay. My first kiss. So I was babysitting with my friend and the kids had this Batman mask and she puts the mask on and starts talking like she's Batman and like I'm Batman's girlfriend. She kisses me through the mask and I kiss her back but there's that plastic between us. And then I wanted to put on the mask and be Batman but we heard the parents coming up the driveway, so that was it. Did you ever kiss her again? No. We were neighborhood friends, you know? We played soccer and rode bikes and went swimming. I wanted to but... But she wasn't a boy but you didn't think you could. What were you like, 13? Mm-hmm. I have a mask in my suitcase. I can show you. No. No, no, no. No sleeping. No, no, no, I'm not sleeping. Okay. You having fun? I'm having a great time. You look pretty. You look beautiful. Hi. Hi. Get on up there. It's not Batman but... Oh my gosh, you have to send that to me right now. I'm gonna put my number in here, yeah? Sure. Can you show me that dance again? All right. Cheers. Woo! Uh oh. Keep her up! I hate to get up but I need to use the bathroom. Great. Terrible timing, sorry. Okay. You look so beautiful right now. What, you do. Don't forget though, okay? If I need you to step in. I won't. I promise. Okay. Hey. - Hey. - Hi. Can I take your socks off? Yeah. Ready? Yeah, I'm ready. I'm in Heaven. I could do this all night. So close, I'm in Heaven. Oh, dear God. Oh, dear God in Heaven. I'm sorry, I'm too tense. We go all night. Just tell me, us, whatever it is that you want. We could all take a nap too. Yeah. Oh, God, babe, I'm so sorry. I forgot. I'm just, it's too much pressure, okay? I'm just gonna. Wait. I just, I need 10 minutes. Hi. I fell asleep. Me too. Is Jenna okay? - She's okay. - Yeah? She just needs a reset. She'll be fine. Maybe I wasn't doing what she likes. No. You're amazing. Best I've ever had. Come on. You know that I'm falling for you, right? It's only because I'm leaving. No. Jenna's brilliant and she's fun. Why would you wanna fuck that up? You already messed it. I don't know. Hello. Hi, again. It goes from hot to cold real quick around here. I'm just taking a break from writing. It's not writer's block, it's just too big a snow ball to get my arms around. Want some? Just coffee. Mmmm. Wow, that's really good, thank you. Thank you. Make sure you take those wet socks off. You don't wanna catch a cold. I'm about to go home anyway. I usually don't see women leave all weekend. So you've known Mia for a long time. Oh yeah. Bought the place six years ago after she sold "Lucinda." Let's me stay here to work and recover. Wait. Mia wrote "Lucina Ancient?" Mia is R.S. Corson, the author that no one has ever seen in public? Don't tell her I said anything. You liked her already anyway, right? Goodnight. Goodnight. Fuck you, Kate. Hi. Can I have some? Mm-hmm. Me too. I have an idea. Oh yeah? If you could just... Oh. Cold. Yeah, I thought we could all use a little cooling down. Oh, it's so cold. Jenna Heaven, right? I feel stoned, so relaxed and sticky as I've ever been. I'm gonna have a shower. Okay. Oh, you guys starving? I'll order some food. You don't smoke. Now I do. This turned out nice with this whole thing. I can't figure you out, what's going on? How come you lied? What're you talking about? You've obviously been sleeping with Mia. For how long? I don't, I don't... You told me that you don't lie, remember? Just don't keep doing it. I told you when we first met, it really fucks me up. Babe, I'm really sorry. I didn't plan for this to happen, okay? I didn't plan to fall for her like I did. You didn't plan? You planned this whole thing to cover your tracks. Made it seem like it was our thing and it's just your thing. Jenna, I'm sorry. Sorry I don't know what else to say. I'm fucked up. Why would you let it get this far? To meet her, be attracted to her, have sex with her? God, you think I'm stupid. I am stupid. I shouldn't have done it, I shouldn't have brought you. You just thought that you could keep lying and she would go to Hawaii and I would never find out. No, I didn't think that. You wouldn't gone with her if she had asked you. No, I love you. Then come home with me. Wait. You're attracted to her too, aren't you? Of course I am. Why do you think I had sex with her? It wasn't just to make you happy. I think you "like her" like her. You "love her" love her. I need to get out of here. Please don't. We can talk about this later. I wanna talk about it now, Jenna. I wanna leave before she gets out of the shower. I'll be home soon. Will you come now? No, she's like in the shower. It's a little bit weird, it's rude. Don't come home. Come on in. I just wanted to let you know I'm taking off. Thank you for a wonderful night, R.S. Kate? Kate? Hello? In here. So Jenna left? Yeah. Is she okay? I don't know. Said she didn't feel well. I'm bummed she left. Yeah. Did she... say anything about me? No. I'm still feeling it. Oh, jeez. Did she not know about us? Fuck, Kate. You said you told her. Yeah, well, I didn't. She figured it out. Jesus, Kate. I'm sorry. I need some food. I'm really sorry. If I order some spring rolls, will you have some? Yeah. As she traced the pulse of the waning affair, she was startled by a strange, new woman who was like a burning cigarette ash skittering and glowing in the road in front of her, making her slow down. Hey. It's me. I'm so sorry, Jenna. If I can talk to you tomorrow maybe. I love you. Hey, could I get chicken fried rice and spring rolls please. No, no, that's just for one. Thank you. Hello, again. Weird. I don't think I've ever had the same driver twice. I'm Yuka. Nice to meet you again. Have a good night? I don't know what I just had. Fair enough. Ready then? Sure. - So... - You can stay if you want but if you need to go to her, you should go. I don't. Okay, well, I'm gonna go outside and grab a smoke. Listen, I'd really like to see you again. Just you and if you want to come to Hawaii, I can buy you a ticket. Maybe I can help you with your novel. Or you can help me with mine. Anyway, you have my number, so call me. Can we pull over really fast? Yeah, of course. Do you need help? Just two minutes please. Okay. Oh God, it's fine, you can go. I'm okay. You're my last ride. I'm in no hurry to get home. Yeah, me neither. Could you get my bag then? Of course. Thank you. Thank you. Last week I picked up a guy who just got married. He was smashed. Had me pick him up way down the street from his reception. Where was the bride? He saw her kissing the best man in the parking lot. He hoped he could go home, pass out and not remember it when he woke up. He was a descent guy. I hope it worked out. That's sweet. Your girlfriend? She's in love with the woman we slept with tonight turns out. You wanna talk about it? I don't wanna throw up again. I'll be quiet until you feel better. Actually, could you tell me a story? Whatever. What you did last Tuesday, anything. Well, Tuesday I took my bike to get fixed. I got a new front tire because someone stole it when it was locked up on the street. I hate that. So I went to a donut shop to wait and I had some coffee... Wait, what color was your bike? Red. I was picturing blue. I'm sorry, go on. So I had some coffee and a chocolate cake donut. I read "Savage Love" and I made a dentist appointment but they didn't have an opening for three weeks and I was glad. Thank you. Maybe a little walk will help? Yeah, that would be nice. Wow. Still here? Yeah. I guess that's a good sign. Come here. We have a little bit of time before the food gets here. I... I need to call off the bet, I think. Home now? Not ready to go home. Breakfast? Food would be good. Yes, I know a good place. Okay.
