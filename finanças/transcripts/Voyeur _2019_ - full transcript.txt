[ominous music playing] [silence] -That was chaos! I, I just don't know where to begin. A live bird on stage, real knives, and fornication? This is a college play, god damn it! There are rules which you obviously abandoned. What were you thinking? -But did you believe it? -Uh-huh. [piano music playing] [piano music playing] -There are two types of people at Yale. [piano playing] The people who come in already crazy, and the people who are destined to become crazy from being there. [grunting] [silence] I heard about the theater theorist Emile Zola on my first day of class, and she was pretty right. We're all products of our environment. [piano music playing] So, I guess it was only a matter of time. I just never expected a play to drive me to the breaking point. [piano music playing] [door opening] -I saved you a seat. [rustling sound] [thudding sound] [indistinct chatters] -Here. [rustling sound] -Welcome to Naturalism in the Theater. [silence] I see some familiar faces in the room. And some new faces, which is exciting. To start off, can anyone tell me what the term "Naturalism" means? Yes, Maxine? -Like a very natural style of theater. -Yes, Maxine. A style of theater that attempts to create the illusion of reality on stage, in costume, in set. See, nothing here is painted. The theatricality is minimal, in fact, it's almost non-existent. But most importantly, Naturalism is seen in the development of character. The line between actor and character disappears until the actor becomes the character. -Like method acting? -Yes, in a way. Naturalism would be like method acting if it applied to everything on the stage. Suddenly, we don't see a set. We're in somebody's kitchen. There's no artificial light, we see sunlight. The actor disappears and we see real people. It's like magic. The theater becomes... -Life itself. -Yes. Life itself. What's your name? I haven't seen you before. -Oh, I'm Ella. [paper rustling] -Oh, Ella, pleasure. As Ella was saying, Naturalism succeeds when the theater disappears completely and we're simply watching life itself. -Hi. My name is Hannah. Um... To piggyback on your previous point, August Strindberg said that, theaters should be a slice of life. -Yes, August Strindberg. One of the most famous and controversial writers of Naturalism. Oh, which actually reminds me of a piece of exciting news. This fall, in order to strengthen the relationship between undergraduate and graduate drama schools, a director from the drama school, Rubel Leal, will be directing a very selective one-night-only performance of August Strindberg's, "Miss Julie." Perhaps the most famous naturalistic play of all time. -Uh... -As you know, a chance to work with the director from the drama school is a very rare and exciting opportunity. So I hope you will all audition, or try to be a part of the production in some way. Auditions will be held in the Branson Center tomorrow night at 7:00. [rustling sound] -So you're going to audition? -Yeah, maybe. It sounds really cool. [rustling sound] [indistinct chatters in the background] [footsteps] -Maxine, are you picking me here tonight? -Ugh. I don't know. I don't know if I want to go tonight. -Are you kidding me? It's the first wilds of the year. -Oh. Oh my God. 300 drunk freshmen discovering their sexuality. [chuckles] -Okay, you don't have to do that every time I invite you. -I need to prep for the audition tomorrow. -You have time. -Well, I need to read the play. -You read it like eight times this summer. -Well, I need to read it again. [sighs] [door opens] -Miss Julie's gone mad tonight, absolutely mad. -What? -It's the first line of the play. [gasping] Wow. How can you even claim... -Oh my God. ...if you don't know that. [chuckles] Well, anyway, Miss Julie is going absolutely mad tonight at The Peasant Dance. - Huh. - I mean, if you want to go method? -Okay. We'll see. [chuckles] -Bye, love. -Right. -Text me. -Mwah. [footsteps] [door opening] -I don't know what's in pages was enough of notes. I mean, I really don't know if I'm prepared. -No, I got some... -I have to write an essay the next day. I don't know if... -Miss Ella. -What? -The theater becoming life itself. -Oh, thanks. -Ella, right? -Yeah. -Are you first year? -Yes. This is my roommate, Hannah. - Oh. - Hey. - I'm Atticus. Nice to meet you. - Oh, Atticus, like To Kill a Mockingbird. [chuckles] - Yeah, just like. [sniffs] Are you guys wilding tonight? - Wilding? - Uhm, it's a the dance club. Everyone goes on Wednesdays. But it's like, all depends on you. - Oh. Who's everyone? - Like, everyone. You guys should come. - Yeah, sounds fun. - Yeah, cool. - It was really nice to meet you. - You too. - See you around. - Bye. [silence] - I hate that kind of hyperbole. [silence] Everyone. [silence] [rock music playing] [indistinct chattering] - Did you go to a lot of clubs in Burlington? - Not really. - Vermont wasn't exactly... - Because I went to clubs all the time in New York. And once I got in the early decision my senior year, I was like, crazy. [indistinct chatters] [club music playing] [club music playing] [club music playing] [club music playing] [club music playing] [club music playing] [club music playing] Come on. [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] Want a drink? - What? [upbeat music playing] - Oh. Yeah. [upbeat music playing] - Two vodka tonic extra lime, please. [upbeat music playing] Two vodka tonic extra lime, please. [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] Come on. [upbeat music playing] - I have to pee. [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music playing] - Hi. - Hi, sorry, I'm just gonna... - Of course. [thump] [upbeat music playing] I like your dress. [upbeat music playing] I noticed it when you walked in. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Thanks. [upbeat music playing] - You're so pretty. [chuckles] [upbeat music playing] [door closes] [silence] - Who said I was flattering you? Who said, I was flattering you? [exhales] [cellphone buzzing] [flipping page] [rustling sound] Mom? [pause] I told you not to call between 5:00 and 11:00. I have an audition. It's for Strindberg play. No, it's not a musical. [silence] Well, I don't even know who that is. Okay, I'm hanging up. No, I'm hanging up. [thump] [thumping sound] [exhales] [thudding sound] [exhales heavily] [rustling sound] Who said I was... - Flattering you? - Yeah, it was good. But my opinion though, [tongue clicks] you should try it more aggressive. Like, who said I was flattering you? - Um, yeah, I'll think about it. - Look, I'm still going to audition, obviously, but why did they have to choose Miss Julie? It's such a misogynistic play. I mean Strindberg literally calls women a stunted form of human being. This is fucking Yale for Christ's sake. We can't just pretend that the last five decades of American history didn't happen. Besides if they had to do a Strindberg, why didn't they do Olaf? [silence] [background conversation] [sighing] [indistinct chatters] - It's for awhile. - [indistinct chatters] - It's like, I don't know he's been watching scripts of emotions - Hey. - Hi. [indistinct chatters] - You knew her? - Not really. [indistinct chatters] - Well, I am so proud to have such a turnout here tonight. Thank you. Well, okay. Uh, Miss Julie. Miss Julie is not a pretty play. It is ruthless. It is erotic. We see Miss Julie, the, the lady of the house becoming utterly powerless at the hand of her own desire. She, she get seduced by her valet. And after they [clicks tongue] consummate, she falls below him and realizing the impossibility of their future, she decides her only choice is to take her own life. But before we dive into the text, we're going to start with the peasants dance. This dance is of vital importance to the production because Miss Julie was one of the first times where the lower depths of society where put on stage. And it made people watch. So this dance is like, like the spirit of the people. It is their chance to be heard. It's their encroachment on the bourgeoisie. - I love him. - Okay. So I'll leave you with our choreographer, Elise. [silence] [footsteps] - Okay, people. So, I'm going to teach the count and then you'll repeat. If you didn't bring your dance shoes then just be careful with your toes. - Told you. - Okay. So, five, six, seven, eight. - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, in, out three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Can I see a rotation of this? [footsteps] So, let's do that again. Going to start with five, six, seven eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Uh, do we want to rotate again? [footsteps] Gonna start with five, six, seven, eight one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. [students thumping] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. [students thumping] [thumping] Okay, so we're going to try this with music five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. [student dancing and thumping] [dance music playing] [dance music playing] [dance music playing] [dance music playing] [dance music fading] [silence] [paper rustling] [background sound only] [foosteps] - Hey. - Hi. - Do you finally dance? - Uh, not really. [chuckling] - It never does. - Ella Anderson? - Here. - We're ready for you. - Great, see you. - Break a leg. - Thank you so much. [footsteps] [door closing] [paper rustling] [silence] - I saw you and went home determined to die. But I wanted to die in a fine and agreeable way, [pause] without pain. [silence] And then, I got the idea that it was dangerous to sleep under a lilac bush. We had one which at that time was in full bloom. [silence] I at last went to sleep and woke up really very ill but I didn't die as you can see. I don't know what I really wanted. There was no earthly possibility of winning you, but you were proof for me of the utter hopelessness of escaping from the circle in which I've been born. [silence] - Okay. Cringe. [silence] Why did you pick Zhang? - Oh, I just connected to his monologue a lot. - Did you prepare any of Miss Julie's lines? - Uh-huh. - Yeah? Okay. [paper rustling] [silence] - Do you think I can't look at any blood? Do you think I'm so weak? Oh, I'd like to see your blood and your brains on the chopping block. I'd like to see your whole sex swimming in a lake like, like the one there. - Excellent. [door opens and closes] - Oh, hey, Ella. Sorry, um, Ruben wants to know your availability for tomorrow night. You didn't fill it out . - Oh, sorry. - That's okay, there's a backside to the form. - Oh, shoot. I'm free all night. - Great. I'll let him know. - Thanks. - Nice job. Uh, next, Maxine Fletcher. [footsteps] [door closes] - It sounds like it went well. - Uh, yeah. [silence] - Maxine Fletcher reading for Miss Julie. [silence] [exhales] Who's to blame for what has happened? My father? My mother? Myself? Myself. I haven't got a self at all. I haven't got a thought I don't get from my father. I've got a passion I don't get from my mother. [pause] How could it be my own fault? To shove the blame on Jesus like Christine does, no. I've got too much pride and too much common sense for that. [pause] Who is responsible for the wrong? What does it matter who is? I know I've got to put up with the blame and the consequences. - Uh, okay. It was good. Um, it was just a little bit stiff. Yeah, yeah, um. [tongue clicks] A little bit too prepared, so it has to feel more spontaneous. - Oh, spontaneous? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like she's saying this things for the first time. - Oh, yeah. - Forget everything you prepared before coming here. [exhales] And again. - Who's to blame for what has happened? [tongue clicks] My father? My mother? Myself? [pause] Um, s-sorry I, I know this, um... Myself? I haven't, I haven't. - Got a self at... - I haven't, I haven't got a self at all. I haven't got a single thought of my own. - Okay. Okay, thank you. - Should I do it again? Because she's like, angry at John, but also begging him to pardon her and... - No, no, there's no need. We're all set here. Okay? - Okay. Thanks. [chuckles] [footsteps] [door opens and closes] [silence] [door opens] [music playing] [background music playing] [door closes] [background music playing] - [screams] [silence] [piano playing] [silence] - He didn't have me read from Miss Julie, but I saw it coming. I'm just, I'm way more of a Christine. Did you read for Miss Julie? - Yeah, I did. - Well, you're a Julie. [laughs] - Well, I don't know. I just read when he asked me to. - Oh my God. No, no, no, it's, it's so nice that like we're different types. I mean, I just know that I'm a Christine. I just know it. [silence] [background music] [sighs] - It's like, why am I always stuck handing out flyers to freshmen? Like if they haven't found Model UN by September, do we even want them? [throws phone] Hello. - What? Maxine? - [sighs] Sorry. I'm so stressed out. I'm not gonna lose this part two to a fucking freshman from Bill Mart. - Who? -Ella Anderson. - I don't know her. - [sighs] [sipping coffee] - This is gonna sound crazy. I had a dream last night, that I pushed her down the stairs. - [chuckles] Okay. - Yeah, I was just standing there watching her falling this long flight of stairs. Then, I woke up and I was like, "What is wrong with me? [laughs] - No, that's totally, no, totally normal. - I just feel like this is my part, you know. Like all summer, I just had this gut feeling, I was finally going to get something big in the fall. - You've gotten big stuff in the past, Max. - Yeah, I fucking clawed my way out of the ensemble. Miss Julie's part for a really good actress. Like, this is my chance to finally be taken seriously. - Miss Julie's kind of a bitch. - No, she's not a bitch. She goes for what she wants. There's a difference. [background music] - So, welcome to callback! [laughing sarcastically] [laughing] So, uh, my team and I, we were really impressed with all of your auditions. You brought energy, which is great. Not everyone has that. [silence] So for our scene, what we're going to do is the scene where Miss Julie enters the kitchen for the first time and there the servants are, John and Christine the real thing. [claps] Let's go! [background music] - Okay. Is it ready? - You ladies wanna talk secrets? - Isn't he inquisitive. - Oh, what a nice smell of violet. - Impudent person is the fellow that an expert in perfumes. - Have you ladies then been brewing a magic potion this midsummer night? Something so is to be able to read one's fortune, so that you might get a sight of the future. - Yes, if he manages to see that, he must have very good eyes. - Pour it in the bottle and walk it to Charlie. Let the man come now and dance this the [foreign word]. - I don't want me just obliged you to anyone but I promised to Christine's... - Oh, well, but you can get somebody else. What do you say, Christine? Won't you lend me John? - [sighs] I haven't got any say in the matter. [drums playing] - With you, Miss Julie? - If you mean it. - It's impossible. Absolutely impossible. - I don't understand what you mean. - Can it be possible that you imagine such a thing for a single minute? - Me, no, but the people, yes. - What, that I should be in love with a servant? - I'm not by any means an educated man, but there had been cases. And nothing is sacred to the people. - I do believe the man is an aristocrat. - Yes, that I am. - And I'm on the down path. - Don't go down, Miss Julie. Take my advice, nobody will ever believe that you went down of your own free will. People will always say you fell. - I have a better opinion of people than you have. Come and try, come. - You're strange, you know. - Perhaps I am and so are you. Everything is strange. Life, people. Everything is scum which drifts across the water until it sinks. I have a dream which comes up now and again. And now, it haunts me. I'm sitting on a very high pillar and I can't see any possibility of getting down. I feel dizzy when I look down but I have to get down all the same. I haven't got the nerve to throw myself off. I can't keep my balance and I want to fall, but I don't fall and I don't get a moment's peace, until I'm down below. No rest until I'm down on the ground and when I'm down on the ground, I... want to dip myself right into the Earth. [soft music] Have you ever felt anything like that? [silence] - [clapping] [footsteps] Maxine, you're still here? - Oh, my God. It's so embarrassing. - No. Why, why are you crying? - [sighs] You probably noticed I was a little off today. It's just I really connected with Miss Julie because... because... - We- well, you don't have to talk about it, okay? - [sniffs] - It's fine, it's just... [sobing] [sniffs] My mom's been really ill lately and it just, the scenes today totally reminded me of the struggle we've had together, that she gets progressively worse. - Do, do they know what's wrong with her? - It's skin disease. - Skin disease? - Uh-huh. - Oh. - She can't even put shoes on. It's too painful. [sniffs] [sighs] - Oh no. - [sighs] It's just she always dreamed that I'd play Miss Julie, and now I don't even know if she'll make it that long. I just want to make her proud. - Don't worry. I have a feeling that you will. Hmm. [silence] - [sniffs] - Okay, yeah. [grunts] [piano playing] [instrumental playing] [instrumental playing] - What the fuck? [instrumental playing] [knocking] [instrumental playing] [door opens] [door creaks] - Oh, Hannah. [door slams] - Hi. - Um... [foot steps] [chair creaking] - [sighs] Okay. I'm not gonna lie. Initially, I was very upset that I wasn't cast as Christine, I really thought I nailed it. However, I took it as a blessing in disguise because I realize now that I need to function as my own agent. Actors have no power. I on the other hand have a lot of things I want to say. And so, I would really love to be the assistant director of this production. I don't think it would conflict with my role as featured female dancer in the peasant dance at all. - Oh. [clear throats] All right, great so I... - I mean, why don't we organize. I, I know how to command a room. I have a black belt in karate. I speak two languages. And I speak a third language but not as smooth as the other two. I... -Sounds good. Uh... I, I could actually use an assistant. [silence] [indistinct chatter] [footsteps] [thumping] [flipping pages] - Congratulations, Maxine. - Oh. You deserve it. -Thank you. - I want the three leads to sit next to each other, okay? - Okay. [thumping [thumping] [background noise] - Okay. - Okay, everyone, so let's begin. As most of you know, Miss Julie is Strinberg's most ambitious attempt at Naturalism. He wanted uh, everything to, to feel real like the audience is there at Christine's kitchen. [chuckles] So some people thought his vision was crazy, but I too am expecting something like that. Like total of uh... Authenticity? - Authenticity. - Oh, yes. So how far will you go to bring Miss Julie to life? [tapping table] Let's go. - The action takes place in the Count's Kitchen on a midsummer night. - Miss Julie is mad again tonight, absolutely mad. - Oh, so you are here, are you? -Now is a finishing touch. You must kiss my shoes. - This kind of thing mustn't go any further, Miss. - Peasants enter. [music playing] - Oh yeah. And then, [claps] that's where the dancers enter into the hall. - [humming] - Oh, kill me. Kill me too. If you can kill an innocent animal without your hand shaking. - Look here. I don't care anything about that because it has nothing to do with me, but if you think you're going to convince him to elope with you and we'll put a very fine spoke in your little wheel. - That's true. I am beneath the very last. I am the last myself. - It's awful, but there's no other way out. Go. - End of play. [clapping] - Okay, uh, nice, nice start. So we have work to do. [sighs] But I am excited for, for the journey we are about to embark on, right? [zippering bag] [flipping pages] [thumping] [clear throats] [background noise] - Oh my God. You're really so good. - [exhales] - I'm so excited to work together. - I feel the same, I think it's gonna be like, really fun. [chuckles] - Excuse me ladies, but we have to be out of the room by 11:00 or the doors lock, so... [footsteps] [door opens] - It's so impressive you're in this is a freshman. You've no idea how lucky you are to have a school of drama director. - Yeah, I'm so excited. He seems awesome. - Have you studied acting a lot? - No, not really. - You're joking. - No. - Seriously, you're like so good. [chuckles] - I mean, my sister did. My school didn't really have the resources for drama film around. - Wow, that's so hard. I mean, you're perfect for the role then. - What do you mean? - Well, like Christine also came from nothing. - Well, I didn't come from nothing. I just didn't have a lot of theater opportunities. - Oh, of course, that's what I meant. - [chuckles] I'm from LA. - That's so cool. - It's the best. You know we should get to know each other better. We're like the only two female leads in this play. - Oh, only a three-person play. - What are you doing this weekend? - Oh, nothing. - Great. Well, you should come to my house on Friday, and we're having a party. Ask for the drama house. - Yeah, I'd love to. - Oh, great. Well, see you soon. [chuckles] [silence] [door opens] [door creaks] - What are you doing tonight? - Oh, I'm just going to this party that - Oh. - What about you? - I'm going to global grounds to play Stratego with two of my friends from Blue. - Oh, nice. - There's actually a thriving Stratego Community here. - Fun. - Yeah. [wind blows] [birds chirping] [background music] [door opens] [indistinct chatters] [music playing] [indistinct chatters] [music playing] [indistinct chatters] - Are you with Colin? - Um, no. - Oh. I just, I just got that vibes from you. [music playing] [indistinct chatters] [music playing] [indistinct chatters] - [sniffing] [music playing] [indistinct chatters] - Hey. - Oh, my God. You made it. Meet my friends. This is Doris. - You, you need to talk to me right now. - Oh, my God. - You will never guess what happened. - Wha- wha- what? Oh. [chuckles] - You guys. Talk to her. - [chuckles] Would you rather be one dog or two? - Um, two, - Wrong. [chuckles] - Ignore him. I'm Reginald. - Hi, I'm Ella. [music playing] - Don't you think her hair would be better like this? [chuckles] Yeah, it's very Greta Garbo Grand Hotel. - Well, she we can be more like Kim Naugler, but after the divorce.

Actually, it's a funny story. Um, so I might say, I played sports in high school, um, in my first year here, but I always knew I wanted to be an actor. You know, I just never had the balls to say it. - No, I feel that, where I'm from, I feel like it's such a vain thing to say. - What do you mean by that? - Oh, I don't know. When you say, I want to be an actor, there is such a stigma attached. Like that, you're self-obsessed or vain. - Hmm... But in my family, it was never the role they wanted me to feel. I came from a family of professors. There all very similar. - Your never everyone's vain. - Well. - No. I mean it's true. I mean we'll make some actor more vain than a professor. I mean actress spend their lives giving voice to other people, to other people's story... - No, no. - ...and experiences and... - I totally agree but you also have to believe that you're the person to do it, that you're worth watching. - Of course, you have to believe in yourself because otherwise you're fucked, you'll go crazy. - No, you're right. - And someone said I'm wild but sometimes when I meet people, I think, wow, like they don't know that they could be meeting the next Sean Penn or... - [chuckles] - Timothée Chalamet. What? [both laughing] - You're just so unapologetic about it. - What is it to apologize for it? [chuckles] - Nothing, I guess. [chuckles] [sniffs] - You're fucking great. - Oh, please. - It's true. What is this whole humble act about? - Very humble act? - Yeah, you just own it. - Oh.

Happy Saturday. - Saturday. -What? - Nothing. - Turning, as I said. Time of lust. Time for regret. - Why? - Well, perfect time to start studio work. Let's go, everyone. Hi, hi, so at the heart of the naturalistic acting, there is this... [tongue clicks] Okay, see, there's this need for a metaphysical experience. You have to, to just connect with your body, and then just make your body like, like a straw, that connects the unseen with the scene and just let the energy flow. Okay, just let the energy flow. Let's start walking around. Walking around as your character. Think about your space, the universe. Your place in the world. What do you want? What do you need? Where's your center of energy? Is it your brain? Is it your heart? Is your crotch? Yes, yes, look to the other people in this room. Yes. How did they change you? Good, interesting, interesting. [paper rustling] Let's just jump in scene one. - Miss Julie is mad again, tonight. Absolutely, mad. - Oh, and so you're here, are you? - I accompany the count to the station, when we passed a bar on my way back - Okay, hold, hold, hold, hold. So, where was Miss Julie, again? - Oh, uh, she was dating with the servants. - Yes, it was midsummer dance, right? - Mm-hmm. She was taking part on that ritual of the ancient ritual of summer solstice. It was a pagan ritual, together, Miss Julie, and the pagan ritual. The lady of the house, the count starter. It's not casual. [clear throats] Do it again. [paper rustling] - Miss Julie is mad again tonight. Absolutely mad. - Oh, and so you're here, are you? I accompanied the count to the station and when I pass the bar on my way back, I went in to have a dance. And at that time, Miss Julie was dancing with that man, Forester. And when she noticed me, she went straight towards me and asked me to be her partner in the waltz. And from that moment, she danced in such a way that I've never seen before. She's simply crazy. [chuckles] - She's always been that way. But never as much as in the last fortnight since the engagement was broken off. - Yes, an affair that was to be sure. - You see that's better. - Mm-hmm. I swear I want it real. By once name her angel. - This is so weird. Like I never thought Atticus was hot before but now that I'm doing Miss Julie with him, all of a sudden I'm like strangely attracted to him. [sighs] Yeah, I can see it. - Right. - It's the end of the day for all of you. [footsteps] - It's just... - So good studio work today, everyone. Um, okay, so I just want you all to take home some work, okay? I want you to start thinking like you're in character in life. Just always be aware. What do I want? [instrumental] [sighs] - Miss Julie is not a bitch, and that's my pet peeve that like so many people have that impression of her. - No, that is not the word. Miss Julie, is... [sighs] It's complicated, she is oppressed. She feels powerless and and yet her status endows her with a power, but it's not real power. - Exactly, I mean, she decides to end her own life, she's disturbed. - Have you ever thought of her relationship to her father. - I think John is like, sexually driven, you know, like all his energy sort of comes from his... [chuckle] You know, with this, yeah. Mm-hmm. Why do you say that? - Well, no it's, it's just like well so he and Miss Julie can only switch places in terms of status like after he slept with her, you know, so it's like his power struggle is resolved by sex. - Hmm. - One of the interesting things I find about Christine is that she's this incredibly developed self-righteous Christian, and yet she sexually active with John. - Yeah, it is true. There is, there is a softness, uh, a sensuality to Christine that does not exist in Miss Julie in the same way. Miss Julie's not sexual, she's neurotic, sex terrifies her. - Yeah, and I find that contrast fascinating particularly, when you consider their different social decisions and how even though Christine isn't a lower social position than Miss Julie, she's also a traitor in a way. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a very interesting thought. - I'd love to have a scene in the pantomime where I'm just like washing my breasts. - My main question is, what are we hoping the audience will be left with at the end of this play? I mean according to Strindberg, Miss Julie kills herself because of a degenerate brain on account of her being female. And, and after she has sex with her valet, she has no other option but to kill herself because she's ruined. What are we asking a modern audience to take away from this? - There are always parallels, Hannah. - Between Yale and 19th century Sweden. - Well, Yale is one of the most elite institutions of the country. We are the largest most profitable employer in New Haven, and yet we are tax exempt. - I didn't mean that. - Yeah, and the people of New Haven depend on what a capricious student body that comes in from a couple of years and then leaves, but the people stay here. - Well, do you think people will be able to draw that connection? [sighs] Well, I want to stay as close as possible to Strindberg's intention which is the slice of life. Where we lead to lead us. I can't say. Will it inspire us to change? I hope so. There is always the hope. [drums playing] - I love that you call them your breasts. - Oh, what else would I call them? - It's just a proper name. [chuckle] [footsteps] - Hannah, are you going on rehearsal tonight? - Oh, yeah, we will rehearse. - Ella, how's your meeting with your Van Gogh? - Oh, it was really fun. We should talk about... - The same, did you talk about your backstory? - Yeah, like my history was John. - I know, we talk so much about my relationship with my parents. My meeting went like way over so long. - That's great. - I'm so hungry. Do you want to get lunch? - Um, yeah, sure. Oh, do you want to come? - Well, I have to write out every beat of Miss Julie by tonight in order to be ready for rehearsal, so, so maybe another time. - Yeah. - Too bad. All right, let's go, Ella. That's why I'm not eating in the dining hall. [chuckles] [soft music playing] - Oh my God. This cake. - Isn't it amazing? [grunts] - It's so good. - You have to be careful though. I gained so much weight my freshman year because I ate so much of it. It's right next to old campus so it was torture. - Well, I would never have known you look great now, you know. - My mom wouldn't let me hear the end of it. She put me on the most insane workout regimen. My mom, she's crazy. - Oh, no! [chuckles] - Which is why if I ever have kids, I'm gonna let them eat all the cake they want. [chuckle] - Do you think you want to have kids? - Actually, I'd love to like donate my eggs to all my gay friends. Kids are career killers and body killers. So obviously, I don't want my own, but this way I know they're growing up in such a loving artistic homes. [ambient music playing] [silence] [flipping page] - Isn't that an anarchy sign? - No, it's an A. - What kind of professor is writing Anarchy signs on your paper? [laughs] -Stop. [paper rustling] - So this theory says that mammals and humans aren't adapted to one environment. -Exactly were completely different depending on where ancestors lived and we haven't stopped evolving even since agriculture was introduced. - Which means that our great, great, great, great grandkids could all evolved to be clones of Sean Penn. [laughs] [thump] - Yeah, or they could have a dramatic stress reaction to politicians. [laughs] [tongue clicks] [flipping page] - Speaking of dramatic, you spend a lot of time with Maxine lately. - Oh, yeah, I really like her, actually. - Really? I could not see you guys being friends. [chuckles] - Why not? - Well, I don't know. You know, Maxine is Maxine. I mean, she's my friend, but you both are actors, so I feel like you guys would be in constant competition with one another. - Well, aren't you kind of technically in competition with your teammates to be like starter and stuff? - No, that's way different. We're all part of the same team so... - And so are we, in a way. I don't know. I just think we're really getting to connect to each other a lot. - Hmm. This is why I like you. You see the world in such a cute way. [chuckles] [music playing] [indistinctive chatter] [music playing] [indistintive chatter] [laughs] [music playing] [indistintive chatter] - Yeah, it is how it is. - I know. Did you ever believe in past lives? - Like reincarnation? - I don't know. Sometimes, I think I was Royal in a past life. Like a princess or something. [laughs] I mean, you're such a good actor so you never did it before, So maybe you did in past life. - Actually, it's funny you say that because sometimes it feels that way. - Yeah. Uh- I had a sister who died. - Oh my god. - When I was 12, she was 16 and she was like, this amazing actor and I mean, that's why I never did it before. In my family, it was her thing, but now when I do it, I feel like she's alive in me. Like something's taking over. -Oh, my God! I just got chills. That's so beautiful and sad. Can I ask, how did she die? -Oh, w- w- we were on a family ski trip and she fell and hit her head. She seemed like fine at first just sleepy. She went back to the lodge to rest and the next morning she just didn't wake up. - Oh my God. - It was a traumatic brain injury, epidural hematoma. - Oh, God, that is so tragic. You've had tragedy in your life. I'm sorry. It's just something I never really liked don't like to talk about. - I'm just curious. [silence] tongue clicks] Wait here. I wanna show you something. [foots steps] [silence] - Oh, my God. You got a bird. - Her name is Serena. - Like Miss Julie's. -Just like. [music playing] - I'm so glad we're getting close. I think it's gonna really have to show. [bird flies] [chuckles] [music playing] - Boo. - Oh, my God. Atticus, you scared me. Are we still on for tonight? - Of course. - Oh, Great. I've been so busy with like the play and class and stuff. It'll be nice to finally get to spend some time together. - You're a great actress. - Hello, hello. Hello, what are we doing tonight? - Oh, um. - Don't tell me, I already know. Red is having an art show and I want you to be my date. - Oh, I would love to, Maxine, but I actually I can't tonight. - Oh, why, what are you doing? - Um, I just have like an essay and stuff. - Oh. - Oh, hello actors. Uh, I'm sorry, I'm late. Let's, uh, just start from the scene right after the pantomime, right after Miss Julie enters. Okay? - Okay. [paper rustling] [footsteps] - Hoo. [zipper unzips] [footsteps] - Charlie Cavalier, you are to be sure to run away from your partner. - On the contrary, Miss Julie. I've been hurrying as you see to find the girl I left behind. - Do you know that none of the others dance like you do? But why do you go about in Livery on a holiday evening? Take it off at once. - In that case, I must ask you to give me leave Miss Julie, from my crew hangs up here. - Is he bashful on my account? [chuckles] Just for changing a goat. As far as I'm concerned, he can stay here. I'll turn around. - Bye, I'll leave, Miss Julie. [footsteps] - Tell me, Christine. Is John your fiance? He acts so familiar with you. - Fiance. Well, I suppose so at least we say we are. - What do you mean? - Well, Miss Julie you had a fiancé. - Yes, but we were properly engaged. - I know but nothing at all came with it. [ambient music playing] - I'm supposed you turn on. [laughs] - Um, and to my favorite. [ambient music] So, how's rehearsal with Maxine going? - They're good. Not as good as with you. Well, it's really intense, but lately I feel like we're really beginning to like connect to each other. We're like, speak the same language. - That is great because at first, you were kind of ambivalent. Like, about Maxine and connecting to her. - It's actually pretty fascinating. It's just a really good idea. - Really? - Mm-hmm. You know, you're still [inaudible] - Ooh. - You know, you're surely adorable. - Oh. - Would you mind. - There is one scene... [grunts] - Maxine, what are you doing here? [sighs] - Ella, I thought you said you were busy tonight? - Oh my gosh. Yeah, I forgot. - Weird. Fortunately, we talked about have to register and I saw you through the window. Look, what I stole. - Oh, nice, [chuckles] - This is cute. It's like the servants night off. [laugh] - Yeah. [tongue clicks] - Wow, this is almost edible. [laugh] - Do you wanna sit? [chuckles] Actually, let's get out of here. We should do some cast bonding at my house. - Um, okay. -Yeah, let's do it. - Great, cast bonding, cast bonding. [laughs] [door closes] [chuckles] - It's time for me to burn. [chuckles] [plates thumping] [music playing] - Okay, Ella, you're next oh, never have I ever. I don't know. Smoke crack. Oh my God. Ella obviously, obviously. - What the fuck, Atticus. - I didn't know it was it was. - Oh my God! Okay it's your turn. Never Have I Ever Had a sex dream about Reuben. - Ew Maxine. - You did? - God it was one time, you totally brought that up because I told you about it. - What? - I guess I did it. Okay. - Is there a bathroom I can use? - Um, yeah, there's one upstairs. Stop, Atticus. Yeah. He has that, you know, he's that, he has that accent. - The accent? [Laughs] - He has. [Foot steps] [Door opens] [Ominous music plays] Are you lost? - Sorry, I didn't know what door it was. We're not done with the game, Christine go downstairs. What? I'm hungry. Why isn't dinner ready? What did you just call me - Ella? I said I'm hungry. Do you want some food? - Oh, um, I think I'm gonna go actually. - Are you sure? It's only like 9 pm - Yeah. I'm like, I'm really tired. All of a sudden so. - Okay, suit yourself. After you. - Thanks. [Footsteps] - There you guys are. - Ella's heading out - Oh I'll walk you home. - You don't have to. - Nevermind. [Sighs] - Aren't you the gentleman? - It's not a big deal. [Footsteps] - Well Bye. See you tomorrow. - Bye [Door opens] [Door closes] Have you ever had a moment with Maxine where you feel like she's not really there. Like in the present moment, not herself. Like all the time. - Well, I just mean She scares me sometimes. Well, she's controlling but it's her part, she's really going for it. I admire it. - Yeah. We all are. Yep. Do, do you wanna come up? Actually I've been thinking, so Maxine and I were talking about sublimation about how we can make ourselves more powerful on stage and I kind of want all my Sexual Energy to be bottled up so it can just explode on stage because I feel like that's what Jean is like. Like he's bottled up. - Oh. - It's just my process. It has nothing to do with you, obviously No, no. I get it. - Okay. Night -Goodnight And that's why when naturalism is effective, it should feel like you've walked in on a slice of life. As if the moment, we're watching began without an audience and will continue without one after we've stopped watching. Okay, any questions? Ella basically, I was just wondering naturalism was super revolutionary in its time because no one was using real props or hiding the lights, but don't movies kind of make naturalism obsolete? Like can naturalism in the theater still surprise audiences today? - That's a really good question. Would anyone like to answer? Yes, Maxine. - well, I think it can in extreme circumstances. Like what? Well, you know, naturalism. That's more than just lights or makeup. Like having real food on stage or using a real loaded gun? Yes. That would surprise an audience not that I'm recommending. it. Does that answer your question, Ella? Yeah, it totally does. What is that? I was thinking Christine should be cooking an actual kidney in the first scene, since this is the smell of her world. I think I'm going to be sick. This is her dinner. I just want to be true to naturalism. It's what Strindberg would have wanted. That's an excellent idea, Ella. - Wait, that was totally right. - This is a great impulse. Let it sink in a little bit. This is her world everyday. You cannot escape. What did you, yes, watch your impulse, yes go for, yes. Yes. Yes. Delicious. Yes, yes, cast take notes. I want everyone to start at Ella's level. The scene starts here. Yes. It's just, I can tell. He doesn't like me. what you Why would he not like you? He cast you He doesn't react to anything I do in rehearsal. He's constantly giving me notes Is that what a director supposed to do? - He hates me, Kate I think he literally hates watching me. Oh my God, do you even think I'm a good actress? - Yes, of course. - You don't have to lie to me. I'm not mad. I think you're great. [Sighs] - Thanks But you don't do theater? [Music plays] Drink to my health. I believe the poor man is bashful To my mistress' health. - Bravo Now, as a finishing touch You must kiss my shoe. - What is this? Is there a food like a ugly lizard or something? - No. Yeah. Yeah. So why are you holding it like it's gonna crawl up your fucking arm. Again. - Now as a Finishing Touch you must kiss my shoe. No wonder why he doesn't respond to you. You need to commend him more. I need more power from you. - Okay. Now as a finishing touch, you must kiss my shoe. - React to him! Oh my God, okay. This, this is dangerous, okay, this is maybe even illegal, this is the first time he gets this close to you. John, take her foot. - Now, as a Finishing Touch. You must kiss my shoe. [Moans] That's better. [Footsteps] - That was intense. - Yeah. I'm so sorry. I was like totally holding this back. - No, no, no I'm just struggling so much with some of the connection between our characters. I should think we do more practice. Yeah, for sure. Like outside of rehearsal. Do you want to go run lines at my place? Yeah, [Inaudible] [Door opens] [Door closes] [Music plays] [Door opens] [Moans] - Kiss my shoe. [Moans] [Music plays] Okay, Christine, this is your chair. Okay? You have been working all day and no one appreciates you and you're sleeping. But don't you look like the gentleman in that coat? Charming. You're flattering me? Who said I was flattering you? - No, you have to make it easier like this this, this, this taxi cannot be self-aware. You just have to be lose. Okay, yes, yes, shake it. Do some shake. You too, Christine. Yes, now you go flirt with him. [Sighs] My father worked on the farm right beside yours. And I saw you when you were a child, although you didn't notice me. - Really? - Yes. And I remember an incident in particular, We mustn't speak about that. Oh yes. Tell me. - No. I really can't. - Just please me. - Yes, yes, now both of you, are you aware that there's another person in the room? Yes, your fiancé is sitting right there in the chair, while the lady of the house is coming on to you. Both of you are acting, like there's no one else in here. You have to feel her presence. Okay. Yes, let it affect you. Again. Nice job, Christine. Come. Is it? So dangerous to tell me now? It's not dangerous, but it's better to leave it alone. Just look at her over there. She'll make a Charming wife, perhaps she snores as well. She doesn't, she speaks in her sleep. How do you know she talks in her sleep? I've heard her I bet you fucking have. What else don't I know, Christine? Tell me everything. [Woman screams] [Music plays] What else don't I know, Christine? Tell me everything . [Music continues to play] - And I can't take it. My old theater director always said there are no, small parts, only small people. No, but it's like I literally feel beneath her. People, Ella. Small people There are just small people. She's getting into my head. Stay with me, Ella. You just need to commit to your work. [Music plays] [Footsteps] Brilliant. Well she is brilliant. Yeah. The other one I don't. Nah, I don't know. Yes, some actors just get the work and some don't. Well, there's only so much I can do. Now, it's too late now. Well, let's see if anything changes. [Music plays] Atticus There you are. Oh hey Maxie, you have classes by? Oh Absolutely not. I had to complain to you. I know it's going to help us. Oh yeah cool. We need to have sex. Like our characters need to actually have sex in the offstage sex scene. We need to know what they're feeling. I don't know. It sounds little bit extreme. Also, what about Ella? Naturalism is Extreme, Atticus. How else will I return to Stage? Ravaged clutching my last shred of dignity. Well, you my now powerful valet convince me to kill myself. We just like talk about it. Let me ask you something, Atticus, did Sean Penn get to where he is now by just talking about it. No he didn't. No, Atticus. He didn't you know what? You're right. He he didn't. This is your time, Atticus. You need to claim it. If Sean Penn is having sex then I'm having sex. Oh, we talk about. We talk for a second. Why are you avoiding me? Isn't it obvious? Can we please have some privacy? I don't think that's a good idea. Hannah, it's okay. I really think there's been a misunderstanding. What addict is seems pretty clear to me, you haven't answered my text in a week. You leave right after rehearsal. Now, can you please tell me what's going on? Atticus. You and her are having sex after we? Who Maxine? Your think I like Maxine No, fucking way. I really like I really like you. I auditioned for the show because I saw that you were auditioning, whatever's happening with Maxine. It's just for the role just for the role. Yeah. What is your excuse for my character? It's purely mental. It's called acting Atticus. Why don't you try acting like you like her? Sorry, Ella, I'm doing my best here. I really want to show the best it can possibly be. No, I'm sorry. You're right. We both need to make it the best it can possibly be. You just killed your bird. How do you react? Oh, kill me, kill me, too. If you can kill an innocent animal without your hands, shaking, help me. Christine help me get this man. Laughs. What a pretty sight for a holiday morning. What? A dirty mess. You've been. I'm sorry. Can we stop for a sec? Sure. It's just the real kidney has helped me so much in rehearsal and I just think we should have a real bird too. oh yeah. But that might be a little bit hard but okay. Continue. It's just the whole point of naturalism is that there's no fake props. So how can we possibly react to a stuffed bird? You know what she's right after all. Strindberg said we are no longer content to see a thing happen. We want to know how it happens and Strindberg said, those who don't accept evil never get anything good. Hold up. Where are we going to get a real bird from? Well, Maxine has one. Serena well, I'm sure she wouldn't mind lending it to us for the sake of our performance. It's not really lending and if we kill it, well, I just been so inspired by Maxine's commitment to naturalism. It would be a shame to cop out now, right next scene. I'll gladly offer Serena really. Wow. That's really generous. Of course. Little Serena. Must you die by the hand of your own mistress. Such a shame. What a shame? Well, I was just thinking about the ending after all these months of striving for Perfection will never actually achieve true naturalism. What are you talking about? Well, I mean Miss Julie suicide at the end. It's not like you're ever actually going to commit to that. No pun intended. Of course not, that would be crazy. Just saying if we're going this far, it's a shame to stop now. So close to perfection. Anyways, break a leg tomorrow. It's almost like, You were born to play this role. Hatchet is good. [Imitates woman on movie] Mrs. Fletcher. Hi, I'm Ruben the director. Hello, I'm so glad. Yes, of course I wouldn't miss him. He didn't even wanna shake my hand. Hmm [Inaudible] Don't touch me. She has to meditate for two hours before she goes onstage. Everyone. HI! So let's gather around. So I cannot express how proud I am for all this work we did together this journey we embarked on and now the play is yours and I take my hands out of it. Tonight, whatever happens is up to you guys. Break a leg, Ella. [Footsteps] [Music plays] Ms. Julie is mad again tonight. Absolutely mad. And so you're here, are you? My company the count to the station? When I passed the bar to my way back, I went in to have a dance and at that time, Miss Julie was dancing with that man forced. And when she saw me, she went straight towards me and asked me to be her partner in the waltz and from that moment, she danced in such a way that I've never seen anything of the kind of War. She's simply crazy. She's always been that way. Never as much as the last Fortnight, the engagement was broken off The fair that was to be sure. Drink to my health. I believe the poor man is bashful [Music plays] To my mistress' health! Bravo Now as a Finishing Touch You must kiss my shoe. First-rate. You should have been on the stage. This kind of thing must have go any further because anybody could come in and see us [Music plays] And que peasants Here's the bird What are they singing? Some nasty line about a [Inaudible] Cheers the first, sing... [Inaudible] they are [Peasants continues to sing] It's best to fly Why? But where to? [Peasants continues to sing] We can't go out, we can't go Christine's room. Then come to my room. You can rely on my being your real sincere You promise? I swear. [Peasants continues to sing] Hand it over. Please, don't hurt it. Don't No, I can't. Hand it over! I'll do the trick. My poor little Serena must die at the hand of your own mistress. Be good enough not to make any scene. Your life and well-being are at stake. What? Is it, is it a live bird? My eyes aren't working. Grunts Kill me. Kill me, too. If you can kill an innocent animal without your hands shaking. Oh I hate I'm in love with you. It's not dead. Oh there's blood between us now. [Music plays] Help me, Christine. Help me get this man. What kind of a pretty sight is this in a holiday morning? And look at the dirty mess you made and your shrinking how do you explain that? Oh fuck Christine, you're a woman and my friend. Help me against this monster. I'm going to shave. Excuse me, excuse me. Listen to me, Christine, you must listen to me, I'll tell you everything, I don't want to know anything. Listen to me. What is it? Then your foolish Behavior with John. He wants to run away with me. Doesn't that sound? Wonderful. And what am I supposed to do? You can come too. You can be the cook, we'll start a hotel. I don't want to go with you. I don't want to cook for a man who barely acknowledges me as a human being. John Oh please. Yes, John treats me like a prop. You're so fucking obsessed with him. No, I'm not, he sucks. He's selfish and narcissistic and you are too and I don't want anything more to do with either of you. What the fuck are they doing? No, no, Christine, Christine, um, I'm sorry, you're right. I feel like I've spent so much time trying to belittle, you. No, It's okay. I made mistakes too. No, you were so much better, and I was so fucking jealous of you and I was petty, I was jealous of you and I just feel like Oh fuck My father, he's home. What? I can't be here when he's home. What do I do? Run away with me? What? Let's go run away with me. Come with me. Let's get out of this place. I hate it here. I didn't do it. Fucking plan. Come with me before it's too late. Okay, okay. [Claps] What do you think you're doing? [Police siren] That was actually really cool. I agree. I'm also really glad my bird didn't die. Sorry, it's fine. And sorry about the whole killing yourself thing. I mean you weren't actually considering that were you? What? No. What happened? How is he? He's getting 15 stitches in his right hand. Oh, I hope you girls realize how many college regulations you broke. We're really sorry. I mean, someone's in the hospital and you completely jeopardize. Reuben's situation. I'm never having a wire Ste director, work with undergrads again. We were just trying to be authentic, authentic. It was manic. Obviously, have you ever read the handbook? Hi. Hi, we're so sorry. You know, all these years I had so many problems with strindberg's piece and you change that. Thank you. What? Oh my God. I can't believe [Inaudible] is banning us from performance and only letting us do Tech for an entire year. I know it sucks. Honestly. I've been taking a break from theater. It's so annoying. Look, what am I supposed to do? It's restrictive and they do all these shitty place by these 19th century misogynist. [People chatter in background] I like [Inaudible] You know, we should make film. - Us? - No, him. Yes, us. Like write it and [Inaudible] it? - Yeah. On our own terms. I like it. Oh my God, this cake is so fucking good. Yeah, he can't be on our film. [Laughs] [Music plays] This is not a perfect time and not a perfect place. This is not a paradise and not a state of grace. Maybe we could wait forever But we're together now For a while Nothing is ever perfect, that's it all. After all These are not the perfect words. This is not the perfect song But if you're still afraid to see then maybe I can sing along This is not a perfect sadness But we imagined more For a while Maybe we'll be happy after all After all This is not a perfect [Inaudible] But this is where you have to begin in This is not a perfect world But you are welcome, you are welcome Welcome in it You are here and I am here and love and fear and hate are here But everything that isn't perfect doesn't have to disappear. Tears of joy and tears of laughter One big beautiful disaster now We're alive Maybe this is perfect after all After all This is not a perfect life But this is where you have to begin in This is not a perfect world But you are welcome You are welcome [Music fades] [END]
