Hello! Haha.. Oh my God.. Hello! Anybody Home! Hey its Ryan.. You guy's home! Anybody home! Hello! Hey this is Ryan.. Anybody home! Ok.. Hello ! Hey, is anybody upstairs! Hello ! Any body up here. Woow, Its kinda.. Come on.. Hello! Hello! Hey its Ryan.. Hey this is Ryan.. Anybody up here! Hello! Hey anybody in there? Hello! Hey This is Ryan Anybody here? Hello! Anybody down here! Nope Hello! This isn't funny.. Anybody here? Wasted... Sorry for the lateness. You people and your 'island time.' Seriously, Francisco... I think you'll find it worth it, Sean. I hope so. I'm beginning to think trusting you was a mistake. This comes from one of the elder's on the Island. Tourists don't go there. It's a small village, been there for many generations. And? I gave the money you provided to a friend who has a cousin on this island... You know what, save it for the novel, what's the story. The place you are looking for is here. Its off the side of the island. The locals don't go there. It's called the Graveyard. Have you told anyone about this place? Shown anyone this map? No. It is the only copy. Let's go. U'm we'll need to... I know what we need to do. Just make sure it gets done. Meet me at my boat in an hour with some provisions. . I'll get the dive gear ready. Make sure no one follows you. Hello! Hey its Jesse! Is any body here? Hello! Hello! Hey its Jesse.. Anybody here! Hello! Hey its Jesse.. Anybody here! Hey is anybody here? Hello! Hey its Jesse! Hello! Is anybody here? Hey its Jesse! Are you up here? Hello! Hey guys.. Where you guys at? Hey! Hello! Hello! Hey its Jesse! Come on.. Future book notes: I hate the Caribbean. The people don't listen and are hard to deal with and I've been here too long searching for... I've always liked the Caribbean. Hundreds of little islands scattered all over the Atlantic... it's like big jigsaw puzzle. And there's a lot of secrets hidden in that puzzle. And a lot of money to be made... a lot of money. Most people want to know about the pirates. I did as a kid, but it didn't take long for me to figure out I didn't care about the history and the sword fights and the fake Hollywood crap; no, I wanted the treasure. I'm a treasure hunter. ...I'm a treasure hunter... and these are my tales... ...no, that's too stupid. Or is it... people like that kind of crap... It would sell a lot of t-shirts: Tales of the Treasure Hunter. Hmm, I should copyright that. Francisco! Get over here. You're sure this is the place? The beach? Your Turtle Back? Yes, Sean. You do have the money we agreed upon? Oh, I've got it. Let's see what's down there first before you get ahead of yourself. This 'graveyard' is supposed to be cursed. That's why the villagers don't come here. Of course it is. Which will make a great story in my autobiography and for the reality show, but if I ever believed any of your local crapola I think I'd go insane. I want double. What? You won't have any of your shows or books without me and my local 'crapola.' You people are gonna make so much money off me because of this... fine... whatever, bloodsucker. Get your dive gear on, let's go. The dive gear is stowed. Good... good... This is it... I don't believe it. I knew it was here... I've been studying the currents around here for ten years. You saw the shelf below us; the plane, the boat hull. There's much more that has come to rest here. I know, my friend. I know. It's the motherload. The dive will take a few more men. I'll get some people I trust. You're sure you haven't told anyone about this place, have you? Or about what I'm doing? No, Sean. I can be trusted. Can you check my pack? There's a logbook in there. It's not in here... It's in there. I can't find it. Hello! Josh is here! Hello! Any Body Home? Josh is here! Hello! I love the Caribbean because everyone is so nice. I'm really looking forward to working with you. You said you brought all the tools you'd need. I don't leave home without 'em. Soo, Ahh you were kind of cryptic on the phone about what exactly you needed me to do. Come on, dude, I signed all your non-disclosure forms... I mean you get my first born if I so much as tweet I'm here. I found what I think is a black box to a plane. Are you Serious? I mean shouldn't you tell the FAA or something? I will... at the appropriate time. It's been in the bottom of the ocean for at least 15 years, a few more days won't hurt. Besides, I have no idea and besides I don't even know if there's any data on it... That's your job. Wow. That's a tall order. I can find someone else if you don't think you can do it. No... I'm good. But a you mind if I use the pool first? Use whatever you like. Just follow through... You got five days. Or I don't get my bonus? Your room is upstairs, At the end of the hall way.. You one of Sean's new experts? I guess so. James. Jewelry and gold coins. Daniel... I guess I already broke the NDA by talking to you. Electronics. So what's the deal with that Sean guy? He's a treasure hunter. He's found a stash of assorted 'treasure' on one of the islands and he wants us to authenticate it. So why all the secrecy? If the stuff I've seen pans out, this'll be a big find. He'll be in every paper on the planet... reality shows, tour groups with his name on them. Not to mention the jewels he's let me examine are indeed the real deal. Worth hundreds of thousand of dollars on their own. Wow. But you didn't hear that from me. Hell, I'm not even the real expert. That's my boss. I came cheaper. A free week in the Caribbean... I'm no fool. Good call. I'm going in the pool. Good Idea.. I guess I should see what I'm getting myself into. I guess so. Gotta look good for the camera. Something like that. I told you, those pieces of pottery you gave me are thousands of years old, maybe older. You've got a major find on your hands. You're going to be famous. Can you date them further? Get any more details? I'd need some sort of oceanic expert. Someone who could identify the tidal plane, maybe analyze some other geologic artifacts from the same area. I can't tell you where this place is. I know. But if I had some other rocks, corals, seabed samples from the area... and with half-way decent oceanographer, I could tell you more. I'll get you those samples. And call around for your expert. But you better give me a great story for the press. Don't worry. It'll be the story of a lifetime. Ask and you shall receive I'm Michelle. But my friends call me Echo. Echo's Island Blog. I've been reading your site for years. You're a celebrity around here. Oh, I don't know about that. I do. I'm glad you came. The chance to write about, what did you call it?; The find of the new century? It's looking like it. Well, even if it turns out to be abust, it's still a good story. I invited a pretty impressive team of experts here to analyze some of the things I've salvaged so far. I think they'll be convincing. So you mentioned. Your room is up stairs, last one on the left. Nice place. The rental must've set you back. It will all be worth it. So you've said. If you'll excuse me, I'll let the others know you're here and to give you the exclusive. Please, make yourself at home. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry... I'm so clumsy. No harm, no foul. You're Echo. I've read your blog. Great stuff. I'm Daniel. Well you the electronics expert then? Mhhhm.. Who told you that? Ahh.. Oh... yeah. Sean got me all paranoid. Yeah, he does place an emphasis on secrecy. Though he did tell you to talk to me about your findings, didn't he? Yeah, he did. And I will... if I ever have something to Share. A lot of reconstruction work in my future. Sounds interesting. Well ya if I can get... Well, I'll leave you to it then. Good luck. Thanks. Very nice blog. Why, hello there, pretty lady. Hello. I'm James. Jewelry and gold coins. That's Tom right there in the pool. He's an anthropologist into antiques... and he may be from Atlantis too because I haven't seen him take a breath in the last 8 laps. I see. I assume you met our host? Oh, yes. Is he the real deal? Depends on how you mean that. Is he an uptight hardass... yes. Don't worry, Sean left on a daytrip to get some samples for Tom. He's not going to be back until tonight. That said, I can say he's the real deal in that he has recovered some amazing artifacts. I'll show you what he gave me... after a little more bronzing. Oh so while the cat's away, the mice play? I take it when I can get it. I'm Tom. I enjoy your writing. Though you're totally wrong about the depletion of coral reefs to corresponding human population growth. Your historical data is all wrong. Ah good to know. I like a little constructive criticism. He's like that. I see. I couldn't help noticing all of Sean's ' experts' are... Young. Yeah. We're cheap too. That said, he did offer me a part in his reality show when it gets going. Reality show? Isn't he getting ahead of himself? Ahh, Who knows? I'm just along for the ride. You should try the pool. I'll do that. Did you find someone?... Where'd you find them?... Fine, it'll have to do for now. Just send them over to the mansion... Yes, fine, just get it done. What's his name? Clay? Whatever, same arrangement. This is Tom. I have found your expert. His name is Clay. He should be arriving there in a few hours. I'll have the charts ready. Will I have samples? Yes, I'm going to get them now. I'll see you later. Would you please tell the others there's an oceanographer arriving in a few hours. I'll need to talk to him as soon as he gets here. Will do. The more the merrier. His name is Clay. Of course it is. Potential book notes: I assembled quite a stable of scientific minds to prove my discovery was worthy of the initial wave of public excitement over the wealth of artifacts and treasure that is to be my legacy... Or maybe it's my initial legacy... I've got things to discover no one has even dreamt of. Jeez, you scared me. I'm sorry. Um, are you Clay? The oceanographer? I thought you weren't supposed to be here till later? Yes. I know the ocean waters around here well. OK... cool. Nice to meet you. I'm Daniel... electronics. Hello, Daniel Electronics. I am Clay. That's good. I guess that makes you Clay Ocean-Guy then. I like you, Daniel. You have a sense of humour. There are items here taken from the ocean. Where are they? Upstairs. Tom has 'em. I think he's got some other things to. talk with you about as well Very good. I think maybe you got the bends from all that ocean study. Though Sean is still weirder than you... Go figure. Book notes: I have reached the limit of what I can do with my scuba gear. But I know the items recovered thus far are just the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more out there, if only I could get my hands on it. Find anything interesting? About what? About us? About Sean? You're a good writer, because you do research. Do you know anything about Sean's background? A little. I know he's made a habit of pissing off some of the more known treasure hunters in these parts. Did you know he had a police record in Miami? Assault with a deadly weapon. He got into an argument with a 'friend' about money. I believe it. Strip club? Race track. Haa, a gambling problem on top of being anti-social. Hope he pays you up front. James, I'm going to need your help with some of the jewelry samples, specifically their density and relative purity. I'm working with Clay to build a map of the sea floor. Sounds exciting. How's Clay working out? Daniel said he was a bit weird. I don't know what he's talking about. Seems fine to me. Of course you would. You're both robots. Wish me luck. Good luck. Who are you? What do you want? You know who I am, Sean. But... It is beautiful here, don't you think? Of course I know now why they call it 'The Graveyard.' Go away. I dove too deep, that's all. My brain is a little off... You're not real. Your time will be up soon, Sean. And not in the way you could imagine. You're not real... How go the mad scientists? Well, Tom and the new guy are working on some sort of ocean flow probability chart... something. What I understood of it was pretty impressive. Do you think they could find out where Sean is getting his artifacts? Probably. They clearly weren't telling me everything. Why, do you think they'll try to find out about Sean's treasure field? I've seen it happen a million times. But as I said, I'm not sure Sean is a guy anyone wants to cross. Ya, He seems wound a little tight. Time will tell, I suppose. Hey, Guys could you two listen to something for me? Sure. I love 'show and tell.' What are we listening to? Ok,, Well I don't trust Sean or the others..if that's OK? Fine by me. Me too. Sean wanted me to reconstruct a black box he found from his treasure field in the ocean. A black box? Yes. From a Airplane ? Yes. That's not illegal at all. I know. It seems like what ever event that took the plane down... Fried most of the data.. But I did manage to grab the last 12 seconds of the last clip... including this audio. Mayday, mayday... hey, get out of here... get off the flight deck...Get out of here.. Your time is now... What the hell was that? I don't know... we are in the area of the Bermuda Triangle. A lot of aircraft and ships have been lost in this area. Flight 828 out of Nassau. It was a small charter flight.. Was reported missing a dozen or so years ago. Headed to Miami, two crew, six passengers. Did one of the passengers hijack it or something? You heard it, they reported multiple instrument malfunctions. Sounded like some sort of electrical storm with all the static on the recording. I can maybe clean up the audio a little more, maybe make it easier to hear. Ya, do that. See if you can find any other transponder information on what you recovered. Ok.. We need to take this to the authorities... Did you find something of interest? No... Just showing them a cat video on YouTube. I better get back to work. How's it going with Tom? Good. It's beneficial to see a problem from another viewpoint, albeit a rudimentary one. Im going to go outside. I'm going to talk with Tom. He might tell us what and where he thinks Sean's treasure field is, especially if there's other missing craft down there. Good luck. I'll tag along with Clay. Maybe I can get something out of him. Clay? Yes. Can I ask you a question? Yes. What do you think of all this? All the jewelry and pottery and gold you've seen? What Sean wants to do with them? I don't understand. Sean is a treasure hunter. And an opportunist... he's greedy. He wants to sell these items... He wants to make a name for himself as a treasure hunter. They are not his items to sell. The ocean is never denied what is rightfully hers, no matter the cost. Is that folklore? It's the truth. You live in your own little world, don't you, Clay? I suppose I do. That was refreshing. Whatever... What Sean's doing isn't really of interest. I'm using him. I have my own interests and fields of study. Atlantis, you're looking for Atlantis. You've authored or coauthored at least six papers on it or at least addressing the claims of its existence. Fine. You do your research. That doesn't change anything. You know, Searching for a lost civilization can't be easy. Or cheap. It may be lost, but if my theory is correct it's out there... and if it happens to be in Sean's precious treasure field, so be it. I deal with facts, not theories. I'm being paid to do a job. And secrecy is part of that job. Even if the job your doing might be illegal? You can use your cheap guilt tricks on the others. I'm not going to help you, in part because I know Sean will can pay me more for what I know. We'll be partners before it's all over. Very mercenary. I prefer the term 'practical.' ...I'll be happy to put something on my blog about it. No problem. No, I won't mention that. Don't worry, I will. Who was that? A contact of mine at the police department. Asked if I'd put up a post about a missing local kid named Francisco. And? His phone records include several calls to and from Sean. I just wanted to make a few bucks. I didn't sign on for this. Should we call the police? Yes. Lets tell Daniel though. And maybe get out of here. What about Tom? Or Clay? I'll let 'em know,I don't know they'll even care. Ok, I'll go get Daniel. Daniel? Hello? Daniel? James? Daniel? Where you going? What've you got there? Sean... I... just... Are you going to be like all the others? Jealous of what I have? Of what I've spent my life looking for? No... I'm not. Because I deserve this. I've worked hard for this. I I thought you were different. I thought you'd understand, appreciate everything I've been through, everything I've done to get here. Well I don't care...Now I have to go... Hello?... what do you mean you're Clay? I just saw you here... I just saw you here!... if you didn't make it. Then who the hell is you?... I am. Who the hell are you? You took something of mine. What do you mean? I enjoyed my time with Tom. His theories were quite detailed and exhaustive. Ultimately wrong of course, but still worth the time I had to spend waiting for you. I don't get it. Get out of here, right now... What did you do to me? One of the artifacts you took is something we need. What are you talking about? Tom presumed my society was wiped out by others. Not true. We were given an opportunity. An opportunity to learn the rudiments of travel through the fourth dimension. You're insane... I don't expect you to understand. We sacrificed our civilization to unlock greater secrets. Atlantis?... You think you're from Atlantis? We can see it all, Sean. The beginning and the end, the alpha and the omega, all at once. And it's going to take us so much longer to perfect our travels. That's why we use you, your pilots, your ships. The experiments continue and will continue. So you experimented on everyone here? Did you kill them? You of all people know that sacrifice is necessary to advance. Perhaps if you are mentally strong enough you will survive the dimensional travel without being stricken mad. Most do not. No... I'll give you money... please... don't... Your time is now. Hello! Hello! Im Here! Hello! Anybody Here! Hello! Hello! Any one! Guy's! Guy's! Hey Guys! Hello! Hello! Guy's! Any body here! Hello!
