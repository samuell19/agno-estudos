Yeah, it's the show after the show, life as a pop star now loser. We're sending Colin to film your every move. No, I want Janelle. So it'll be like my own show or? No it won't, where are you? Luckily, still L.A. Well, you got to scoot over to the airport. You got a 1:00 p.m. flight to your hometown, oh God, what is it called? - Sandy? - Yes, that's it. Why, why are you sending me? Every loser is going to their hometown, they're moving in with their family. You know, you are not gonna get much of me at home 'cause my life in LA is so much more interesting. No it's not, we checked. Look Kay, this is gonna be amazing TV, oKay? Big city girl goes back to her hometown, no one has ever seen that before. - Well... - Do you wanna be remembered as a boob girl? This is your last shot, Kay. All right, Colin's gonna be on your flight, I'm gonna email you the details, good luck. I'm just gonna scout it out first. Here we go. Mom, it's me. You here? - Baby girl! - What are you wearing? Can you stop filming? I'm not ready yet. It's not how it works, Kay. 10 Long years, baby girl. Or five. You should've won that damn contest. I gave those bloggers a piece of my mind. What bloggers? - And you would be? - This is Colin. He's just gonna be doing some filming a little bit. So let's just stay out of his way. Wait, is this "After The Cut"? - No. - Yup. How do you know about it? That Marissa called, you should have told me. Oh, they compensated my phone, - so. - oh wait, I get it. You planned this whole surprise entrance, Mr. Producer man. I'm gonna set up the guest room for you. It's a little bedroom right next to mine. We'll share a wall.

So I'm gonna let you rest today and we'll pick this back up tomorrow. OKay but like, what are your ideas? 'Cause this is like,... Probably get better footage once you've had a day off. OKay. - Good idea. - Cool. Oopsies. Mom, the door. Oh my God! I can't believe you're actually here. I voted for you so many times. She's here, she's here. Oh my gosh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Can I hug you? Oh my God. I knew you'd be excited, - huh, huh? - Oh my God, Miss Bonnie. Hi, Miss Bonnie. Kay, this is Anna, the little songbird I've been coaching for Spring Spectacular. Still doing that, huh? No, retired. Now I just help those who wanna take it to the next level. Oh my God Kay, you should do the Spring Spectacular. Oh Kay is very familiar with the Spring Spectacular. She got her first period at Spring Spectacular. - Mom. - One fan kick and boom. This year we're raising money for the children's hospital. We have kids who need a leg here, a kidney there, and they just can't afford it. And Kay, we are so, so glad you're here because America is going to see how amazing you are. And might give a little boot to... Yeah mom, I got it. So what do you think you'll sing? - Excuse me? - For the Spectacular. Just keep in mind, it's an Easter theme. So think Jesus, think apostle. I'm thinking "Pump Up Our Love" but I'm changing all the lyrics that say baby to savior. And we're working on Anna's vibrato to give her voice a more mature sound. ♪ Like Liza ♪ Uh-oh. Let's get to it girlfriend. OKay well just an FYI so everyone here is on the same page, I am going to need to check in with "Pop Star Now!" first to see if I'm even available because I'm like on call with them. So whatever they need, I just like have to race outta here... We'll have they called? No, but something might come up. - It won't. - OKay, I'm just saying that I'm gonna need to check in with them first and then I will let you know. So the mall gets really packed on a Saturday. So there are gonna be a lot of people who recognize me here. So should I act natural or should I actually refer to the camera or you know, should tell a couple jokes and really show off my personality? Whatever. OKay, it's not really an answer, but. Here we go. Hi girl. All right, where to next? Oh my word, little Kay. Hi, Miriam. All covered up? I'm just teasing, whoa. I'm just kidding you. We have been praying and praying that you'd win that show, but clearly God did not want that from you. And you know what? If I'm being honest, I just, I think they did you a real disservice dressing you in mustard. - OKay. - You were just like walking gray poop home. I mean, it just washed out your gorgeous skin tone and made you look 10 years older than you actually are and heavier too. - OKay. - So much bigger. I said Thursday, she's just a little slip of a thing. You know, how'd she get to be like a size 10? - That much, huh? - How'd they do that? But you still look so beautiful. - OKay. - Shut the front door. Nano. Hey. How long have you been in town? Just a day. - A week. - A week and you haven't called me yet? You oKay, buddy? Oh yeah, yeah, never been better. Wow, maybe that's why you haven't called me yet. Who's this? Oh, I'm sorry, this is Colin. He's like a second skin. He's my DP for the next couple of weeks. DP? Director of photography. It's like a showbiz term. Must be why I didn't recognize it. Yeah, they've added this "After The Cut" part of the show I was on. Oh yeah, I read about that, where they follow around the losers. Oh well, kinda. I mean, I guess there was like this fan outrage and they were like Kay, Kay, put Kay back on the show. And so I'm one of the stars of the show now. Congrats dude. - Thank you. - Yeah. Well I have a kid now. I see. Wow. Well you did it, good for you. Thanks Nan. Too bad you've turned into shitty a friend. Did you get any of my messages? I'm sorry, what, when? Like over the last five years. 'Cause I'm curious why you wouldn't call me just once maybe when I got pregnant or maybe when John left me six months after getting me pregnant or maybe when I actually pushed the baby out. But hey, I hope it was worth it 'cause you've changed, you suck, but welcome back. Come on, bud. How you feeling right now, Kay? Awesome, wonderful feedback from my fans. It's on. This is "Pop Star Now!". This is it. Which one of our singers will be joining Ty in the "Pop Star Now!" season finale? Will it be Jack or will it be Bethany? Bethany, please take one step forward. Tonight you will be the one going home to the mansion! Oh my God, oh my God. Which sadly means Jack, this is the end of your journey here on our show. Oh Buddy, you bad boy. Hey Col, you made it. I'm heading out. Speaking of losers, America, here is your very first "After The Cut". ♪ Lock it from the inside ♪ ♪ What's in his heart to break? ♪ There's something really good about what you did and that something excited me a lot, probably more than it legally should. I will prove it to you, America, that I can be your "Pop Star Now!". You are not our "Pop Star Now!". Welcome to Sandy, home of mature singer and runner up, Kay. ♪ Boobs, boobs, magical fruits ♪ ♪ The more you eats, the more toots ♪ ♪ The more you doopie doop, a boopity boop ♪ Bethany's oKay, I don't get what all they hype is about After months with her fellow contestants, it's not easy adjusting to life outside of the mansion. Oh God. Shit! But in a few days she was back on her feet, reconnecting with her humble community. I hope it was worth it 'cause you've changed, you suck, welcome back. I mean it washed out your skin tone and it just made you look 10 years older than you actually are. But nothing cures the elimination blues like the comfort of your family. When did this happen? What happened? Well she started wearing a bra at nine years old and she got her first pube 10. So no, it's not hard to believe she let her boot pop out my by accident. Oh my God. Wow, Kay, we hope you're doing oKay. Hopefully Janelle had a better week. We'll soon find out, stay tuned. - Hello? - Hi, this is Kay Montgomery from "Pop Star Now!". What? "Pop Star Now!". You say Kay? Yeah with a K. I'm actually just calling to see is Anna's in. OKay, thanks. Oh my God, is it really you, Kay? Hi Anna. - Yeah. - Did you watch - "After The Cut"? - Yeah I watched. Listen, you know it seems that the network is not gonna have a problem with me at all joining this Spring Spectacular. - Seriously? - And you know, I actually think it's going to be a great opportunity for me to help the children. We have our first rehearsal tomorrow at seven. Yeah, oKay, great. - See you then. - This is gonna be so great. Nice job on the show. I absolutely loathe reality television, but you have an oKay voice. - Welcome Kay. - Oh hi, Miriam. Now this is Clive. He's our pianist and also bit of a local celebrity. He's just off his tour de force performance in his man show version of "Cats", which is called Cat. Riveting performance the other night. - Gentle. - I'm so excited to meet you. I'm Michael Bronson Junior, but everybody calls me Mick. I'm so excited to meet you. - Yeah... - I'm gonna do the best job for you, I promise I will. Yeah Mick, it's me, Kay. Mick, they just called you over there. I gotta go 'cause I'm playing - the bongos. - Go, go, run like the wind. There was an accident. We just don't mention it. I'm so thrilled you're joining the Spectacular. It's just wonderful and we're just gonna be like old times. Anyhow, now that you've met Mick and Clive, over there that's Holly. Oh Holly. Oh, oh, oKay, she's busy, and you know Anna. Oh, they come and go so quickly. Now before we go into the details, I was wondering if I could ask you to share a few pointers with the gang. Oh, yeah. I think it would be really good for that program that you're doing. Yes, good idea, Colin? Chop chop, Colin. Just teasing you. OKay everybody gather around, attention, everyone. That's right, just keep gathering. There you go, all right, gather. Keep gathering, all right. Great, now I just wanna thank each and every one of you for giving your time, your talents and your trust to yet another Spectacular this year, yes. And we have a very heavy weight on our backs this year. As you know, we're raising money for the children's hospital and what we're hoping is we'll raise enough money to buy, what have we here? Yeah, for three prosthetics and two liver transplants. How 'bout that? Unbelievable, doing Lord's work and I'm also very excited for this year's theme. Just busted about it, it's Easter Extravaganza. Yes, yes! Isn't that fantastic? And I'd like to first announce that the lead role in this production will be played by Clive, he'll be playing Jesus Christ. Don't let it get to your head. But we also have a very special guest joining us and that's our very own little Kay, but you may know her from her program, "Pop Star Now!". Whoo, I love you, Kay. All right, now before we pass out the song order, I've asked Kay to just help us out by starting us off with a few pointers, some professional pointers. So if you would. Well hi, everybody. Well does anyone have any questions to start? Did you pull your boob out on purpose? Okie dokie, all right, you know what? Let's just dive in, I think is best with the song order. I'm gonna do that right now. I worked very carefully on, we have five numbers total as per usual starting with the opening number, that's the group number, I love so much. ♪ Easter has Sprung. ♪ - Love that song. - Yay! And then we're gonna go to, well, I'm gonna come out and welcome the crowd. It's a big crowd pleaser and then we're gonna have Holly and Mick do their percussion experimental duet. Usually I sing a solo there, but I'm on vocal rest. So I'm doing a percussion duet instead. I play nine instruments. She does and then after that, we're gonna go to Anna's solo and then we'll move into the last supper slash crucifixion, blah, blah, blah, and then we're gonna end with Kay. So any questions? Terrific, let the play practice begin. I'm so proud of all of you. Oh goodness, it was that, how was the volume on that, Colin? That was good, I got you. Now as far as distance goes, like is that, I know a lot of times like in theater, you should be far away, right? But I think it's more intimate right, when you're doing television. - Well you probably know, Kay. - Yeah. Can get you like this. - OKay. - It's not bad. Where's my glass? Are you gonna be here the whole time? Maybe. I'm super happy you're doing this. Yeah, sure. When we started selling tickets and when we announced that, you know, you'd be part of the show, we sold like almost half of them already. Can you believe it? Pretty amazing. Do you know what you're singing? Not yet. I can't really think of any resurrection ballads off the top of my head yet, so. Well maybe you could write one. Oh yeah, right. I was wondering, do you ever get nervous? I do, I always get nervous. Nothing like being on TV though, am I right? Well, I guess on, I guess when I sang on the first live episode, I was nervous 'cause I puked, but like nerves are funny. I mean, what's the worst that can happen? Well, they could not like you and maybe vote you off the show. True. When did you start singing? I started singing after my mum had to go. What? Oh, she got sick, so she had to go. I live with my dad and my step-mom Jasmine now and she's pregnant. So, they mostly just sit around and watch TV, - stuff like that. - Sorry. Oh, it's oKay. Sometimes I watch with them. No, I mean.. Oh, it's oKay. I'm super, super happier here even though I wish you would have won. You are just too fun, you're on the wrong side of that camera, that's clear, that's clear. Are you in there? You're welcome. For what? Introducing you to those folks so you could do your help the less fortunate thing. Goodnight, mom. You know what your problem is? You want too much. You always have. They didn't want ya, you're not the most talented, so what? Goodnight, mom. You'd be a lot happier. I really can't speak to this because I'm not her, but I just think it's really sad when people feel like they have to do things like this to gain attention, you know, especially women. We need to stay empowered. She has a really nice voice and that should be enough. Nudity is not the way to get ahead. Hey. Getting a snack? Pedialyte, my kid is sick. Oh no, I'm sorry. If you're ever up her getting a drink, I'm just here for the next couple of weeks. How about right now? Yeah, sure. No, I mean like right now. Oh yeah, no, I don't think I can do that. Oh that's right, I forgot, you're a celebrity now. No, that's not it. Then why not? Well I haven't stolen a beer since like the last time we stole beer. Well, it's not like it's hard, he's blind. Walt went blind? Security cameras. Please, this place barely has running water. Oh, that's right, I forgot you changed. No, I'm in. OKay, it's the same as always, but now the beers are at the back. What? Crap. Oh, it's fine. Come on, you're a pro. OKay. Go. - I'm going in. - Go. Wait, your bangles. Come on, blind people can hear food digesting. - True. - Oh and your shoes. Oh my God, those look like who's looked like the shoes we found in Jessica Bellerman's dad's closet. How are the Bellerman's? He goes by Judy now. - I knew it. - I know. OKay, go. Wait, your skirt. What about it? It's gonna clack every time you walk. Well, I'm not taking a skirt off. You have to take it off. - No, I'm not. - Take your skirt off. I'm not taking the skirt off. - Take it off, take it off, - No, no, - take it off, take it off. - no, no no. Is it vinyl? - It's so ugly. - OKay, going in. Oh, it's designer. What, why? Just go. Wait, don't get anything too hoppy. Oh my God. It gives you hemorrhoids. Yeah. Down. - Wait, what? - Thanks Walt, put it on my tab. Are you kidding me? I don't think anyone will see this coming. I don't think so either. All right, Kay, Kay, you're up next. Oh, she had a big week. Didn't y'all read? Hey Kay, you're up. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't have anything. Oh, you don't? Oh, all right, oKay, that's all right. So why don't we just agree to nail it down? No pun intended. That's me. That was not intentional. All right, but in all serious, we'll nail something down next week and Anna, sweetie, you're gonna be next. Wait, you can sing your audition song from "Pop Star". You know, the famous one that, you know, what's it called? Forget the words? - Did you forget the words? - No, no. Oh good, that a girl. Go, Kay.

Well, I'll tell you Diane, we have a fantastic show this year called Easter Extravaganza. We do have a little trick up our sleeves, our very own local girl makes good, Kay Montgomery is gonna be performing here live with us and she's singing an original song that she just made up herself. You heard it here, folks, a special guests from TV's "Pop Star Now!". There's only a few tickets left. So you wanna come on down and snag yours. Hello? Kay, Marissa, gotta make this quick. So the producers want you to do that song you've been writing on the finale. - Really? - I know, I can't believe it either. Dang, I mean this means so much. Yeah, that's cute. So the band needs some extra time to rehearse with you now. So we'll be flying you out a day early. Oh, oh you mean tomorrow? Yes. Can't they just squeeze me in after I arrive? No. It's just that it's Easter Extravaganza tomorrow - and I promised... - No Kay, it's insane here. Rehearsing a day early is the only way they can do it. You signed a contract, Kay. This is huge exposure, they never do this. What is the holdup? They can't make an acception? Once again Kay, not how it works. I'll be emailing you flight details, I'll see you tomorrow. Of course. Try shifting your weight to your right. - I think it's the rope. - Nope. See, there's a knot in it right here. Mick, my brother's a contractor. I'll get him in here tomorrow and he can... Tomorrow? I'm dangling 10 feet up in the air, people! Miriam, Miriam, if you have a second? What is it doll? I just got a call from "Pop Star" and they want me to sing my song in the finale. Oh that's wonderful, Kay. Isn't that sweet? Oh my gosh, no way. Yeah, yeah. And you're making me come back a little bit earlier than planned, tomorrow actually. So I am going to have to miss the Spectacular. - What? - Oh shit. Seriously? Can't you stay for the Spectacular and then go? That's what you can do. What she just said, that's what we'll do. You can do that, that would work. Still up here. What about the hospital and all the tickets? Anna, Anna, you could sing my song. Well, we'd have to make an announcement and refund tickets. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sure people will understand. They will not understand. The audience was counting on you and we added a show. We did? Just don't go. What? Don't go. - How? - They don't own you, miss your flight, take a later one after the Spectacular. Yeah, yeah, you could do that. - Do that. - Still up here. Yeah, I can't do that. Why not? Well I don't wanna jeopardize anything. Oh, so you want to go? Well yeah. Well they're finally taking me seriously, Nan. They're taking you seriously? When did they start doing that? It's just not how things work. Right, like in the real world. No, I'm just saying I have to stick to my commitment. What do you think this is? You wouldn't know the real world if it shat on your face. I am just really stuck here. Tell me about it. This is not my fault. No, it's your choice. I fixed it. You don't have call your brother 'cause I fixed it. Yes I do. I have to have him refix what you just fixed. Come on. Does he have to go on one of those? Do you even have insurance? Hey, good news about your song. Must be good if they're having you come back early. If I can finish it. I always knew you had it in you. Too bad you have to leave the gang high and dry. You know a lot of those sick kids watch the show. They voted for you too. And what is it that I owe them, mom? I didn't say you owed - them anything... - Well you didn't have too. Why are you leaving again, Kay? Can't you just be happy for me? I am happy for you. - No you're not. - Yes, I'm happy for you. But? Baby girl, you're not happy. And how would you know? OKay, I have let you play this thing through, but you... You are like to Delisa on "Sunset of Desire", determined to elope with Derek when she should have stayed put and she wound up destroying the lives of the whole village. Well did Delisa have a mother like you? Ever since I've gotten home, all you've done is paraded yourself around here and hijack the one thing I've got. I did you a favor. I gave them something more than a drunk, sad couch performance. So you did notice that I was sad and drunk. You should be glad that I care this much. Your care is a curse, it suffocates me. I've had to be away from this house for five years just so I can breathe my own air and look what it's got me, I'm America's biggest joke. That's not on me, that was your choice. And now the dress isn't right and the camera's not right, and what, now your mom's not right? Nah. What the heck do you want? No, what do you want? Do you want me to care, do you not want me to care? Let me know. You want me involved, not involved? Tell me what to do and I will do it. I don't want to be you. I don't wanna wear a leotard, I don't wanna have ice in my wine, I don't want to end up with a shack in my backyard. Quit trying to be something you're not. You are an embarrassment, mom, and I don't wanna be a fucking loser. You don't wanna be a loser? Then I suggest you figure out how you can win. America, this is the night you've all been waiting for, the season finale of "Pop Star Now!". ♪ Pop star now ♪ Who will go home the winner of $1 million and a recording contract and who will just go home?

We're back and just moments away from crowning our "Pop Star Now!" winner. But first we have another one of our losers with a very special performance. Here is your third runner up, Kay Montgomery. Kay, well you have had quite the bumpy ride here on our show and if a natural born superstar like Bethany had not shown up, I would have sworn that you would have had a better shot. Let's take a look. My name is Kay Montgomery and I've wanted to be a singer my whole life. I liked the song, but I'm not sure about the vocals. Well something really good about it, but something that about like fingernails on a chalk board. ♪ Right before the song began ♪ You are not our "Pop Star Now!". I'm sorry, you're out. Quite the journey, Kay. And America has really taken to that journey and the journey after that journey. So we have asked you here tonight to sing a very special song, haven't we? Yes, a song I wrote myself. So here's singing an original song, here's our troubled girl, Kay. But first I just want to thank the folks at "Pop Star Now!" for covering the costs of the Easter Extravaganza ticket sales. And for their generous donation to the Sandy Children's Hospital, $1 million. What? We need to go to commercial. We can't. What, did you know about this? Colin! So thank you, you really do care. Now I don't think it's right to sing this one without my friends from Sandy backing me up. What do y'all thinking? Yeah! Well then let me introduce the cast of your favorite ""After The Cut"", Holly, Mick, Clive and Anna. Oh go, Holly. You gotta be kidding me. Hey look, we're on TV Hi mom and Jerry. You sure are, buddy. Just do it, do it, quick, we are not going commercial. We are live! Well it seems America wants more. Zoom on camera three. America, this is why this is the best show on television. Anything can happen. And now here's Kay and her Easter people. This is for someone who taught me how to win.
