Krasnodar, the last game of the qualifying World Championship We are loosing but we are still looking for our chances to come back in this game. There is still time left Our team is putting the ball back into the field after the penalty shot Our captain, Yuri Stoleshnikov is taking initiative upon himself This is a call for a penalty, my dear friends! Great opportunity to correct the situation for our tea The Romanian team is surrounding the ref, but it is their problem Penalty is called. We have to see who will be executing it There is a rule, that the one who earned it, won't be the one who executes it Yes, Stoleshnikov is happy with himself, but most likely he is not going to be the one who will be executing it Because we have a designated player for that It is Alexei Melnikkov, he picks up the ball But look, Stoleshnikov is taking a ball from him. He has a right as a captain Our captain is very confident If he is confident, we will have to believe in him too We all know it is the most important game for the Russian team in many years We are very nervous Yuri, it is your turn! What was it, Yura? Why ?! I don't know about you, but I have only words left that you can't use in public You have to pull yourself together and get mad, there is still time left to make it up Our captain is back on the field with the ball Obviously, the fans are upset, but the game continues He pushes forward. Center of the field What is that for? Our captain is loosing temper after the failed penalty kick Red card, of course Our captain pushes the ref His team is trying to come him down This is not the football anymore Come down! Stoleshnikov failed to deliver to his team, to his fans, to his country He takes off his captains band and leaving the field with his head down It is hard to imagine what is going thru his head right now Yura, what have you done? People are expecting.. This is not a football Stoleshnkov fell for provocation Fans are throwing at him bottles He received the red card, he pushed the ref now he crossed the line with his fans We saw similar situations in the past with other players This will be a cause of disqualification Now this provocative gesture I am afraid this episode will have a grave impact on the sports career of yuri Stoleshnikov The Coach Subtitles by Nataliya Carpenito I thought you will give me a chance to leave decently And where are you going to play now? Yura, we won't have a farewell party here, sorry I see Even after the disqualification you will be able to play for some team for a year or two Why leave? yeah Danila Kozlovski Olga Zueva Irina Gorbacheva Viktor Verzhbickii Aleksandr Ilin Jr. Igor Gordin Hey, what are you doing?

We will have to leave. You have two days to pull yourself together and get back on the field We will work for a year there and then you will come back No, dad, I will do it on my own I won't ry to convince a 34 year old football player You are right, let's skip that all right then What's wrong? Dad, look at me, let's give each other a hug It will be easier Are not we related? One step, do it for me, Dad it is good, right? I did not turn out to become the one like Messi. You have to accept that. You tried, you did your best There is crowd outside, why don't you bring the car in the courtyard Let's go home Open up! You will rest, then we will have a talk Did you see how I put in right into the center?

We had to sell them due to financial difficulties Why was not I told earlier about it? What would have changed? Larisa, are you an adequate person?

The only thing, how long were you there with no real job? And you will continue on the same path. Because no other fool will trust all of this to the man of your reputation. Good day, The question from the Kuban' News Newspaper Yuri, please tell us if you are surprised by the invitation to our city? I am surprised that the woman is a President of your team. Next question. Do you have any special strategy that you are planning to implement in your training here? The strategy is simple. We will go on the field and we will win. And we will do it again. Friends, let me, as a Mayor say couple of words here. It is our honor, to have such successful man, as Yuri Stoleshnikov accepting our invitation to be the Head Coach of Meteor. We on behalf of the City, promise to give the support to our team and our new Head Coach.

Stoleshnikov is leaving for Moscow How is your spirits? Great They thru bottles at me at the first game, they were frustrated that I am the woman Then they got used to it. First game does not mean anything. The results are at the end of the season. Why am I the Head Coach? Why me? It is a simple question You are considered retired and no one expects nothing from you. You have no where to go. That how the miracles happen. What do we call a miracle? If we make it into the League for example? What exactly? Miracle would be if they don't build the shopping center in this place. This city does not need a team. You came up with that. Now it is clear. I will go work on miracles. Will be catching unicorns and shitting rainbows. Don't forget about my position. Andreevich, I will do it later, as usual. How is everything going here?

Yuri Valerievich, it happens, right? Keep up. Do you like running with weights? Where are the weights? Right there, you have them Why do I need fat asses, that will be crawling around on the field? Work on getting back into shape before playing. Who is going to play? Don't think you are irreplaceable Two more full circles Have you heard of practices when they set up the team players to kick the ball in order to improve their coordination? Masykov, we will be running here till the evening Masykov, let's add one more full circle for you. Don't run so fast Beautiful Is it plastic? How did you come up with it, Yuri? Did you read it in the magazines? Who are you? Last name is Berger, I am the kids coach Skin has to breath, Yuri This is too much stress to the heart How come you did not put the gas masks on them? so to have a guaranteed heart failure He is from the Capital Take a rest We will just poke his tires couple of times, and this will be over Go back to Moscow Let's go have a talk Good bye Let's make a deal I won't tolerate mediocrity and rudeness I won't expect you to play like Messi or Ronaldo But I will expect you to play at the top of your abilities So you won't be ashamed of yourself later And what for? It all sounds good, but n reality it will like that If we win or loose, we don't get salary raises or bonuses Do you have any other interests in life except money? For example make it into the First League? No What are you talking about? The young guys will run over us there. Half of our team is always with the injuries Everyone has families It is our last season, and then we will go back to where we came from. Maybe we will make a deal here? Everyone knows why you are here. You will do your time and leave Let's do it this way, we will keep quiet, and you give us a chance to have a life. You have to stop pushing around and catch up with him there Are you playing for defense? Zuev, stop pussy footing around Engage your brain and use it on the field Tell me what do I suppose to do with that? What is this? This is a description of the nature of the trauma During his run he slipped on the unravelled plastic and received the trauma of the tail bone Should I show this to Lara when she's asks me why Varennikov is not training today? If we have the weight problems, maybe you should fix their menu first? They are being fed like it is a farm here Why are you always upset with me? I am not upset I am just doing my job You did not like me from the first time you saw me Maybe we will sit down for a talk, cool off the situation here Sure, and I will have a chance to read you the list of traumas for the last week It seems that they are returning from the battlefield and not from training Everyone is suppressed Are they coming to complain to you? Not to complain. They are in pain. Good bye. Why is this here? Ham? eliminate More protein during the training sessions Prior to the games switch to more carbs Tell me this, my friend. Why our menu does not get changed before the games? No heavy meals 24 hours prior to the games Valerievich, I need to talk I am off We have not finished, right? Something substantial still has to be in the menu, right? They are not eating for 5 hours, then game What do you mean, 5 hours? So they do not overeat before the game How do you expect them to run, if they are hungry. The last meal should be 3,5 hours before the game. Valerievich, guys came to see me It does not look very good here What guys? Our players, does not matter who They are complaining What are they complaining about? Nothing special, little things here and there. Tell me what is it exactly, stop beating around the bush. You are insulting them, your training techniques are too harsh Took away their days off and bonuses It all adds up, I don't want scandals Are you worrying about bonuses? No, I am good there Valerievich, you are a young coach, emotions running wild I got it Do you understand the goal? What goal? Were not you told? Not really We have certain players that are playing, getting in shape, and we sell them in a year. They are for sale then Why do you say that? They are good guys The list is pretty short. This season we have 4. I am not getting involved in the coaching job. Maybe you should change it a bit. What changes are you taking about? More diplomacy, individual approach What exactly? You are on your own here, I am not sure. All right then, I will look for new ways Deal then? Of course Hear me I see you don't like playing ball, so I came up with the new game During the training session today, you will be rolling those tires back and forth What exactly are we training this way? Our spirit and endurance And you will get the necessary life skills, that you will need once they throw you out of the club Are you serious? More than that. I am in agreement with the sea port administration. They will support your training I am not participating, you can fine me Oh no, fine won't cut it here. You are sabotaging the coaching here Did everyone sign the contract. Article 3.1.3, do you remember it? The player must participate in training and other activities that have been chosen by the coach The key words are" other activities" and "must" In case of non compliance, the contract is null and void plus compensation of 3 monthly salaries back to the club I am in position to decide how you should train You can leave the club on bad terms and in debt, you choice No, let's go! Let's shake some fat off, and get in shape More energy! no cheating looks like you have muscles You can't do this to people Did you want to say something, Larisa Vladimirovna? Continue on! Did everyone hear the President of Club Meteor? We are continuing our training session. put more fun to it Let's go Good job, guys Mitya, take them for some rest Are you guys hard on hearing? Don't touch the ball! They are punished. I am training them without the ball today. Let's run a little. How will you play the football, if you can't touch the ball? Come on here Come on Come on Take the ball away Take the ball away from him There is a lot of you, guys Take the ball away get in line Strict coach you have Do you know why they took it away from you so fast. Because they missed playing with the ball. My time here is from 2-3. Next time, keep on walking. Back from the start, let's go Championship of Russia, Finals, 14th Tour Fans are chanting in support of the Meteor team Harsh violation of the rules. Senseless in the middle of the field The reaction from the ref is the red card! Everyone come down, sit down! Shinnik is in possession of the ball They have an advantage with one more player on the field Diagonal pass Varennikov? Why is that? He is falling unobstructed Goal, Shinnik is leading now Very serious mistake on behalf of defender Varennikov What caused him to fall? The field is not wet, it is not slippery Shinnik is making a play But Meteor defenders are not doing their job We have an attack one on one Goal! They are on it to ruin it It looks like few of them are on it The goalie and defenders Put subs in for both defenders So far we can only put one in. Let's put Zuev in Zuev, go in! The grass is slippery, is that so? Meteor does not have much time left Zuev is managing to handle the ball on his own He is not scoring, but it is very good attempt Young man, did you start believing in yourself? Let's skip the drama, we have to loose here, got it? The second goal, there was one on one situation. My calf was sprained, so I could not catch it And you did not know that your leg was injured before? Well, I did speak of it in the locker room Hey there Varennikov! You are here, my friend? Why not collecting money? What? Everyone, take a look at him! He is not only screwed up the game, he also placed the bet He made a money bet under his own name, using his passport, what an idiot! He put a bet against his own team! Varennikov, you are the flaming idiot! You should go to take a nap, Yuri Valerievich! I can't. I am thinking about you, guys. How will you do without me. We are not coming to the practices drunk. I am drunk and I can do more, than any one of you, who is sober We saw the game against Romania Did you say this? He is bringing up the Romanians here Give me a ball Get to the gates What do you mean? You know We will do the bet? How about that. He is talking about the Romanians I will show it to you All right, I did not score then, and I did not score now It is all right Let me know, what I owe you later. You all go to hell! Platini shook my hand. Yura! I will have one too It is so smooth. You are doing well here Yes, I'm made out of steel What about you? What about me? Are you always like that? Keep pushing forward, and keep on drinking Yeah All right, if we are having a drink here, tell me What did you come here for? Oh, I see, I have to say something politically correct here, right? No, I see for myself One against everyone They don't care about anything but you still care Why? Why are you asking? We came here to drink, so let's do it. I left where no one needs me any more. Came here to win. But no one cares about winning here. What's next, I don't know. What about you? Me? What's wrong with you. There are so many guys around and you are alone. You didn't have to notice this. Sorry That's all right Because I don't need the relationship just to say I have them. How many fingers? Good, we can keep on drinking Hi there Where is Varya? She is at work Varya was sleeping in my room sorry about that Do you want to ask me how I am doing? I do. How are you doing? How is school. School is boring Thank you Yuri Valerievich, may I ask you something? Do you like my sister? Do you like her like a woman? Do you feel anything for her? She is an interesting person. All right, I like her Ok, then Do you want me to make you some coffee? It is a strange place, to be honest. Why here? Look, Amin what is off side? Is it a type of a meat dish? I need to find a respectable place to have dinner. I feel guilty I had to spend the night in your apartment. So wanted to do something nice in return. I just let you sleep there, so you don't have to wonder around the streets being drunk. Thank you That is nothing Dasha's mattress need to be changed to the new one. It is too firm. I see you made friends. She is cool. Where are your parents? All right then, leave it Well, we have a dad But since our mom died 5 years ago he left and just sends us money once a month And we call each other for the holidays What about you? Everything is great That's very descriptive to say it is great. Would you like to add some details to it? Not today, some other time. How do you do? Hi, there You know guys, I was wrong Let's start over again You are the team, who knows how to do it. What can I add to the picture? I need to get some coaching time here, so I will just come and sit at practices You can do whatever at your own pace. So you won't be training us at all? What for? Ralph, give me a ball, you don't need it. If they ask you any questions, blame me. Tell them I ordered you to rest before the game. Anyone who touches the ball, pays a fine of 1,000 rubles Are you for real? Why not? Viktor, make sure they follow that. Just refrain from drinking, so you don't burn the place down. You have to be able to trust each other. I am not going to take part in it Why? What are you here for? To win With what team? You want to push this morons to the First League? Give them bonuses All of that does not help to learn how to play Instead of giving the pass, they kick the ball in the middle of nowhere Every man is for himself, there is no teamwork You have 11 individuals running on the field But I have a little brotherhood here Until you ruin them And how do you think I suppose to intrigue them? Football. They have to understand that they represent the whole region Why do they care, if they know that their coach can leave them for Moscow at any time You will get a better offer and leave I won't lie, there are no tender feelings between me and the team at the moment But you can change this they are just like you little guys You are working hard on your boys, and then you pass them to someone like me and then they get broken again Now you will have a chance to coach them all the way If you make up your mind, find yourself a sub and come to me to work as an assistant coach You know, I am the young coach, with little experience I will make the mess here, and then you will have to deal with it Think about it Can you do this? What are you doing? This is not your home here. But this is your home. It is your stadium, and it is your team. What are you doing, except shitting around. We are playing just as you are cheering What are you chanting all that rubbish for? You, for example. How old are you to be chanting this crap? What should I do, keep silence? I don't know. Sing, play instruments Dress up so you can be seen from space Help us! Otherwise none of this makes any sense. So we will start singing and you will start winning Did I get it right? I am not sure about us, but you will Between us, we don't have much of the chance in the Championship many games were lost But are you going to be with us in the Cup? There are not so many fans at the games Look, they came to watch our practice Warm up Came here from his Moscow to make the circus here Keep working, guys, wake up! We know what needs to be done, you don't have to tell us. Petrovski! Break into two groups and start running Come on, guys, we have a show here Don't get distracted, keep on moving It is boring! Keep up! Ralph, 1,000 fine Sorry, nothing personal Who is with me? Petrovski, 1,000 2,3,4,5,6 9,10,11 What is going on here? Practicing I will speak to Smolin Varennikov and Masyukov will have to leave on the bad terms for their actions against the team No Your have 3 days window to bring in the new players then it will be too late I won't give up my old players Why? I like them, good guys Yura, I came here t o support you, but you are sticking for them What is going on? Look over there What do you see, what are they doing? They are playing the football Why? Because they want to They want to play, Lara. Champagne! It is easy to throw them out, but it is much harder to make them believe in themselves Meteor! You wanted a miracle, so don't stop me Great I have found a sub for my little guys All right, let me go introduce you to the team We have the new assistant coach Berger Adolf Alekseevich Hi, guys Viktor Evgenievich, let's do some scrimmage here Meteor! You won't be able to sell the Senegal player Everyone knows that he has 3 extra kilos that he can't get rid off Do you want to keep this fat ass or you prefer 300,000 cash All right send me the paperwork by fax Why Zyaba is playing on the left side? He wants to play from start, that is why he is saying that he can play both sides But he is only good from the right leg That one is a good player, but he keeps looking back His son is there He does not want to leave him home And he is here collecting balls Tell him not to bring him to the games Why are you watching it from here? I can see everything from here What is up with Masyana? What about him? He is at home, on probation for his deeds Talk to him But on the other hand he should have been thrown out, so others would not follow in his steps But on the other hand, maybe you should talk No, you should throw him out I don't want to get involved, it is up to you to decide Do you know why I did not fire you? When you play as a deadwood, it is one thing But I hate to see when you burry your talent! Do you still believe that I will fail Help me out here Take this team as a captain, you will be responsible for each one of them I won't try to convince the 30 year old player Zuev is afraid of trauma, he is avoiding confrontations If you manage to open him up as a player, you will see the gift there I don't know if we will be able to make it into the Final League or the Cup But we should promise each other that we will do everything we can for that to happen Cup of Russia, 1/32 Thank you, everybody Let's go thank the fans! Meteor! Come here, my dear friend Come hear, bastard What are you doing? I don't want to see you here again That is enough Go back Go on What was that? Are you aware that we lost our second opportunity for transferring the players? This bastard made sure we are behind on the payments and then reported about it to the top I know that Why are you so cool with that? What do you suggest? Get rid off him Yura! Mayor is the one who hired him, he is the one who can fire him Did you ever have a desire to do something against your father's will? I did have it. It is you. Great choice, Club President Vladimir Anatlievich, there are problems with making it water tight but, try to understand, the supplier is behind on his end. You have to finish it in 6 month. Suppliers are your problem If you fall behind the dates, I won't keep you Let him through I am sorry, but I was told that you won't be in the office till the evening I always have time for the sports stars What is happening? I am asking you to fire Smolny Why should I do that? If I put another person, it will take time for him to catch up Then he will start stealing, that's for sure. Listen, I understand everything Smolny is your man, but you have to replace him We are doing everything on our end to be noticed We will stop being non profitable, we will get the local sponsors Yura, let's be honest So you want the city sponsors support the team? What for? Let's say you make it to the Premier League? Then what? Can we count on anything after that? No We will win the Cup! What is the point? Yura, do you remember the teams that took this Cup for the last 5 years? I don't remember them either. And you will tell the seniors, whose houses are being flooded to be proud of the Cup we took. Keep yourself within the limits. Your are not the young boy, so you should understand. Except the stadium we have the city, inhabited by the people with their own problems. Who are you to decide where city sponsors should invest? We have real projects here. We need new power ambulance station here. We need more schools and kindergartens. Football costs us 200 millions a year. That money can really improve the life of the people. So here is my advice. Forget about this Cup, or go back to the Second League Football is a torched earth with a layer of shit on it. Nobody needs it here. No, it is needed. Maybe it is needed more now then ever. I have been a Mayor for the past 12 years. 12 years! And you just got here. Are you going to teach me how to love my city? Who decided that the city needs Football? The young man, that got paid 20 million a month and missed his shot? Your tactics are great! But your game stinks Zuev! Let's go! I am interested to know how you think of that? You are intimidated on the field, like it is a car that can run you over? Or a mad dog? No, I like dogs Me too Me and him had some fun in the woods near by. Well, he was helping me out. What about the police? Those were not real cops You know, Zuev, it is like that If you are afraid, then just give up and got bitten Varya will fix you up if needed Hey, illegal fishermen? Should we fill out some paperwork? All right, just kidding We won't bother you Are you afraid, Zuev? You are right. You handled it well, you will be fine, you won't starve Tell me, did you do this on purpose, to help me out? Zuev, are you all there? Do you think that if you ride someone's bike, you will start to play like Maradonna? If that would work I would be the coach in Barcelona. Why then? It is boring here, so I am looking for excitement. Yeah, Zuev, don't forget to bring those bikes back Did you start this remodeling while ago? We did not get a foreign players, you know about that? We could not get reinforcements. We have a very short list of players. What are you planning to do? I don't know Maybe I will put one young guy in, he seems to have something in him But on the field he gets lost. I don't know. Dad, may be you will come to take a look? What is there to see? You go and play. They are printing it so small, the glasses are not helping me. Are you kidding me? What is stopping you? The year passed, your legs are fine, go play! Should I go on the field, like nothing ever happened? And what happened? It is just a game, so go and play! This young guy, Zuev he is afraid of everything, acting sheepishly I am encouraging him, "Go ahead"! but I am the one who is afraid to look at the bleachers I can hear what they are saying and what they are chanting writing about me on social media I can feel their hate every day. Go and play, "it is just a game" It is over, Dad. I am the coach That's enough Dad with this remodeling Do you want me to hire the construction workers for you? That is not fun Dad, You are the man You too My birthday is in a month, if anything Do you know the ref that's going to be in this game? It is my friend. Will you talk to him? It is Finals, the game is important to everyone Torpedo got too far, we need to level it. Tell him to be honest in his judging The Cup of Russia, Quarter Finals 1:0, Yuri Stoleshikovs Teams leads in the games of quarter finals for the Cup of Russia Stoleshikov is very emotional Zuev is being harshly knocked down. It has to be a yellow card for the opposing team. Zuev gets the jury and leaves the field Meteor has 10 players on the field now He is a player that needs confidence He is ready to go back! The ref makes it look like he is not noticing that Zuev wants to go back Hey, he is ready to get back in the game! Hey! Why did it happen, he waited for 60 seconds? He was ready to go back for the whole minute! Hey, judge! Look at me, I am talking to you! You are corrupt! How much were you paid for this? I am asking you to leave this area Tell me the price! You need to step back! Now if Meteor makes it to the Semi Finals, Stoleshnikov will have to be watching the game from the bleachers. This will be a big loss for his team. His emotions are vital to his players Why did you take the money, and judge like you did not? I will give you your money back Did you win the lottery, or Torpedo gave you so much, you can't fit it in your pockets? Why are you nagging me? If you want me to tell you that someone on the top decided that they don't want to see you in the Cup, then I won't tell you this. Stick to the left central player, get very close to him Make him use his right leg more, he will make the mistake sooner or later. And then others will handle the rest And you, don't rush, take a little pause, handle the ball Play around him Zuev, how is your leg? It is all right Can you play? Mitya, let him play! Give some harsh greetings to the number 15 when he gets in your zone of control he will stay out of it And ignore the fact that I am not on the bench, I am with you guys, watching all of you! Go, Meteor! Mitya! There is little time left in the main time of the 1/4 Finals for the Cup of Russia Torpedo versus Meteor, score is 1:1,there might be an extra time added One of the last attacks of the Meteor Pass to the right flank of the field, Zorki takes the ball Pass to Petrovski, and he scores! Leave us alone, please What is wrong with you, Zuev? Well, I was running and.. And what? You have to play, you have a ball, and you have to score, what else you need? I am trying, honestly. I don't give a shit about your efforts, you have to put up the fight, and score, and don't pussy foot! Your ankle is sprained! Do you enjoy sympathy? Where does it hurt? Here or here? That is enough! Here is your problem! It is not in your leg, it is in your head! And until you solve it, nothing will help you! Neither practices, nor bike rides. Can I see you for a minute Did you have to put him on the field? How long will it take to fix him? 2 or 3 weeks? It is not that simple, just to fix it. Yura, we are dealing with people here, they get broken at times. They go thru pain, fear, they get offended. Think what you are doing to this boy! He is scared as it is, and you are keep pressing him. Do you believe that if you will push him, he will start playing, but what if not? What if you break him? Hi there! Hi Where have you been? I got up early and went to the market. Varya, I have been up since 6 AM Get ready for school, what do you want for breakfast? Did he tell you? Who and what? Varya, come on, I am serious! You are still young, I can't talk to you about it. Don't pry, please You fell in love, I can see it by your face You fell in love, I know it Finally, hurrah!!! Dasha, we are working together. If someone finds out, it might happen that people will think wrong things about me. Let's not talk about it for now, all right? Come here Would you like your omelette with ham or tomatoes? I will have it plain, and you can have the omelette with ham and tomatoes Deal Hello, yes, I am his son When did it happen? Hi, Amin, where is Yura? He is over there How long was he here? Yes, he has been here awhile. Yura! Hi How are you? I am good And you? I tried calling you but you did not pick up. I understand, it must be very hard for you now. I am thinking about Zuev now About Zuev? I have to do something about him Putting him in the Semi Finals with this injury is quite risky How is the team, how are the guys doing? I have been away Yura, are you OK? You should go, I need half an hour Bye, Varechka Everything is fine I told him over and over again, call me But he thought that I am too busy But I would have called him back every time I went to see him and he told me to go back and play on the field I am playing here, I am playing That's what you wanted? I am playing. The nurse, who took care of him told me, that he did not want to talk about his diagnosis in order not to distract me from my important job here Important job it is Cup of Russia, Semi Final Meteor We are all with you! We will win! Go! We are together, we are stronger Very few minutes left to the end of the final match of the Semi Finals for the Cup of Russia 0:0 so far. Will we see the time added and maybe the series of penalties? The stakes are high. Who is going to make it to the Finals? 0:0 It is very charged game and we will be facing the dramatic ending. Fakel is on attack, they can score now! It is a dangerous situation! But the goalkeeper saves his team. Fakel has a great moment. Bragin can lead the attack of his own team He throws the ball far off Petrovski, pass to Grudin Zorki, now pass to Dodin Meteor is in possession of the ball. Good control in the center of the field It is time for a pass Goal! Unbelievable, will they make it to the Finals? Igor Masykov scores at the last minute! Everyone literally looses control on this little stadium, that now looks like Luzhniki Yura, we are with you! "Coach, we are with you "on T-shirts How many games so far? 24 games. The turf is in good condition considering the end of the season Yes, we have specialists here. High tech systems of controlling the temperatures of the field. But you know, what is the most important? What? The agronomist. He comes at the end of the game, looks around, thinks the he does his magic touch to the grass He is in charge and tells us when the field can be used or just looked at All this High tech nothing compare to him When everything will start to rely on high tech, when the computer will be telling you about all the mistakes Then there will be no football left. Technology is capable of everything But it has one problem, it has no passion And it will never have a heart I often see the question in the eyes of the people Why do we need all of this? We won, now what? And only human who has passion and faith can answer to this question. And can make people to believe that there is nothing impossible in their lives that they can't achieve What you have done to the Meteor, gives me the right to trust you with something bigger the team that will be worthy of their coach Yura It is time to come back home This is a big honor But I see that you need time to think about it alone All right, I will be in my office Good time, here is our hero, our winners! Where is he? What is your name? Masyana Masykov Igor Congratulations! Great Goal! Perfect! Thank you Not Pelle, of course, but why not?

Yura, by the way, congratulations to you on moving to Spartak, the National Team! I understand, you have been waiting for this offer for a long time. Everyone needs to grow, but don't think that we will be holding grudges here. If something goes wrong again, you can come back All right, we won't interfere here, I will show you more Really? Are you leaving us for Spartak? When? Let's not stand here Start running What now? What now, we will keep practicing You don't have to explain anything to me. I am not going to apologize. We set the rules in the beginning You did not even give me a heads up, handed me over this team of miss fits, that was it. I told you I will go back if I can, what questions do you have for me? I am being offered to be The Head Coach of the First Team of the Country, who would refuse that?

Lara What is the matter? Get out! My congratulations to you. You will succeed! We will succeed together, Varya! You are coming with me. That is what you decided? You created here something special, I have no name for it. Something that can't be abandoned for the better team. Varya, I am not abandoning anyone. The team is paying, and the mechanism is working. Maybe you are right, I am not the coach, I am the doctor. And I am the Coach The good coach wants to train the champions, I understand And the doctor treats whoever comes to her. And does not choose the patients I will go, OK? How are they? They were thrilled You see, you were right Malya will go to Moscow Yura, sometimes you are smart, but sometimes you are...

May be without us, but you will be fine I was serving in the Tank Detachment Do you know what is the most important thing in the tank? What? The most important thing is not to shit your pants Here it is Singing farewell song this is not a dream, this is the truth The love always wins Hi, guys How is Moscow? Moscow does not have a sea, and the parking is not free. I am glad to see you. Today I want you to forget about the Cup You did a lot already Go to the field and put on the jerseys of those famous Clubs And just play football for your own pleasure Like if you are the kids in the courtyard You will be the Moroccan player, don't let us down We will play against Spartak together I thought, why not? It will help to sort out the staffing issues So be easy on me. Respect the age. Go, Meteor! The most important game is the Final Game for the Cup of Russia Moscow Spartak versus Meteor Stoleshnikov received the offer as a Head Coach for Spartak a week ago Yuri Stoleshnikov is coming back as a player to play against his former team, He leaves the position of the Head Coach and becomes the free agent Talking about the chances of Meteor, anything can happen in football Football is the game of people We remember the team of Iceland, of course they did not win the championship. Portugal won, but everyone remembers In any case we expect the exciting Final game Legendary Moscow Spartak against Meteor, that managed in short time to get so close to the Cup of Russia This will be the great Finals, it will be very interesting - Hello - Hi there May be you will smile at least? Or you are not happy to see me? Of course I am glad. Let me I am all set, it is not heavy. I got it. All right then, I will go. Bye Yura! Can you help me with the bags? Take one I did not expect. I understand that you are not here for good. Varya, what are you saying? I came to see you. It does not happen like that Like what? I know that you did not come back for me. Not for you? I did it for me, for the first time in life. and not to prove anything to somebody. You can take the second bag. Sorry, I am just I am stupid, right? Hug me I can't, my hands are full Krasnodar, the Cup of Russia, The Final Game The Spartak is behind this wall. We all understand They are stronger, they are more experienced, they are from the higher League They have a lot to loose Many of you think that it is not a shame to loose to the team like that in the Finals You did more, than anyone expected from you You have a lot to be proud about But I am sure, that the only ones, who can influence what is going to happen in the next two hours here, is us Right here, in this room we have to decide who we are. The Team that has the right to this Cup or we are just the lucky ones that made it to the Finals Whatever will happen there I am proud of every day we spent together on the field. I am proud to be your Head Coach. And if anyone will ever tell you that you made it here due to luck send them to hell. Because you deserved it. Forget who they are. Just play the football that you know how to play. I want for them to see what I see. You are in the tank, when you are on the field and, as I found out, it is important not to shit in your pants when you are in the tank. Go, Meteor! Dear friends, we welcome you in Krasnodar Here, in this wonderful stadium we will have the Final Game for the Cup of Russia Legendary Moscow Spartak will play the rookies of this season, Meteor Meteor absolutely unexpectedly made it to this Finals We will see what comes out of it. In any case the whole country will enjoy the football. Go, Meteor! The whistle is about to start the game. All attention is on Yuri Stoleshnikov He used to play for Moscow Spartak then he was a Head Coach of the Meteor Here is Krasnodar, we have lots of fans who arrived both from Novorossiysk and Moscow get to the gates Spartak is in possession of the ball in the beginning of the game they seem to be overpowering pass on the right great reaction from the goal keeper Pavel Bragin, the nick name is Maroccan He is an important player on the team Spartak seems to show the superiority over the possession over the ball Pavel Bragin rescues his team Look at the reaction of the fans and the coaches Stoleshnikov receives the pass from the goalkeeper He handles the ball well, goes around two opposing players he has a block and very good pass Cross bar! Stoleshnikov's pass was very precise He is tired, but he is playing smart Spartak is in the possession of the ball again, pass on the right flanks. Meteor is not having much luck to catch up to them They are late for about two seconds in each episode Red team is in control of the ball Pass to the left, very good Oreshkin, pass Goal! The Meteor player scores the goal against his own team Rafael Hamedzhanov, bad luck Bad luck for the Meteor. It is very unfortunate. It is all right We have a long time ahead of us, we can handle it. Yuri Stoleshnikov shows his spirit as a team player Spartak, of course, is more experienced and strong team Spartak is a favorite team on the field today. Stoleshnikov manages to make it close to the gates He scores! 1:1 Yuri Stoleshnikov evens out the score! The Flag! Offside But, wait The ref shows that the offside was registered I am not sure about this ref's call I did not see it But the ref is showing the yellow card now There are lots of emotions Important to have the final call of the judge And as far as I can understand that the main judge of the game confirmed offside Spartak fully controls the situation on the field You can see the higher level of the players on the Spartak team pass to the right Meteor is demoralized Goal! Spartak scores, 2 : 0 That's a very comfortable place to be for a Moscow team Spartak is on the way to their next trophy! To add another cup to their already impressive collection of the trophies 2 : 0 Meteor is practically lost in 2007 we played against the Brits, we were loosing by one in the first half then the coach came to us and said something What did he say? I don't remember, believe it? Said something and left. And then what happened? We won 2:1 But the funny thing no one could remember after what he said to us Maybe he did not say anything, just made a joke What are you sitting here? Are you going to play or not? Do you have any conscience? I see you having fine talks. What are you laughing at? You have to do something, look around for some conscience, you might find it. Laughing.. Listen to me, piece of shit Stop suffocating my team I will use all my connections to keep you out of football! It is up to you to win one day today or for the rest of the life. Got it? The 2nd period in the game Spartak versus Meteor Spartak dominates on the field, that is supported by the score 2:0 We will see how Stoleshnkikov will show himself as a leader So far Spartak dominates the game Stoleshnikov has the ball Amazing skills of handling the ball He goes one on one He is knocked down What will we hear from the ref? Why he is not making a call? It is the penalty for sure. The decision has not been made yet. The game was stopped. It is important to know what is with Stoleshnikov? Will he continue the game? The pressure is mounting. He had shown the great maneuverability. Simply amazing! We are awaiting for the judges call. This is penalty! Dear friends, this is penalty! What is with Stoleshnikov? I want to know. Because he is a leader, and he is the most important man on the field and he is a coach. We all remember well what was going on on this stadium literally several years ago. Then during the match with Romania, in the decisive game for the Russian National team, Yuri Stoleshnikov did not make the successful penalty shot. We thought that his career was over then. Damn it You can do it, you won't miss! It looks like he won't be able to continue the game. He is going on the bench and asking for a sub. Yuri Stoleshnikov leaves the field and goes back to his work as a coach You can't even imagine what's going on here, on the stadium! The whole stadium, all of the fans are chanting ' Stola, Stola!" Of course they are upset, they know what kind of player he is. Even the fans of Spartak are applauding to him. Yuri thanks the whole stadium and he leaves the field Bravo, Bravo! Yuri Stoleshnikov! The legend of the Russian Football Now all the attention is on the field. Igor Masykov will be shooting the penalty. Fedor Lyas is a goalkeeper. It is the most important moment for the Cup of Russia So here we have it, Igor Masykov against Fedora Lyas Meteor against the Moscow Spartak! 2 : 1, Meteor scores! Everyone understands how important this goal is for the Meteor! If it would not happen it would reminded us of the Game in Istanbul, the penalty by Fabio Lonzo But nevertheless, Igor Maykov scores Senya, you watch your area, play tight Got it? Number 15 is your personal responsibility. Go, Meteor! We are close to the finish of this game. Spartak is still leading 2 : 1 Red team still prevails on the field Meteor can’t pull it thru so far. Another attack of Spartak on the left. Good work by Pavel Bragin Meteor confronts the opponent We see the level of emotions We can see that Meteor wants to save the game, trying to score, but so far Mitya, put in Zuev! Yes, Zuev, hurry up! Zuev is a very young player. He did not have the most successful season. Yes, he does have a talent. Very questionable call on the part of Stoleshnikov To be honest, I was expecting something different. I won't be saying anything. It is just a game, so go and play! Go, Zuev! Zuev is in the center of the field. You can see that he is nervous. As I mentioned earlier he is a young player. And this is a big event, the Finals on this great arena in Krasnodar He is being pushed out. The reaction of Stoleshnikov is very characteristic. It seems like Zuev is not ready for this game. He looks lost and even scared, at least from the look in his eyes. We will see. The final minutes, it is a minute 87 of the game in Krasnodar Meteor has very slim chances. The fans are disappointed. It looks like everything is clear at this point. Stoleshnikov came to the very edge of the field I don't understand what is he trying to do and what is he yelling. His last name is Zuev! Zuev! Zuev! Very original call from the coach, that is what he comes up with. Zuev! Goal! That was something! Zuev! Unbelievable! He evens out the score with Moscow Spartak, it is a tie now, 2:2 Stoleshnikov and Zuev are hugging! Those are emotions and drama! It looks like Meteor got a hold of the game. Spartak can't get a hold of the ball. Meteor set up the tiki-taka the Barcelona style The fans are charged They are already celebrating the potential victory against Spartak Zuev is in the Center of the field, he intercepts the ball Zuev, he goes one-on-one with the goalkeeper! Goal! Friends, it is cooler then Bavaria or Manchester! Meteor scored the third goal! Meteor leads 3:2 against the Moscow Spartak Wow, that was something! I want to relive this game once again! 3:2, Meteor leads! But this is not the finish, friends Spartak has one minute of additional time The whistle of the judge, Free kick for Spartak There is lots of commotion on the field The regular guys from Novorosiysk lead against the Moscow Spartak Spartak is getting into the position This is an ideal opportunity for Spartak to score I can imagine the emotions of the Meteor fans, and their coach Stoleshnikov! He probably wants to turn around and close his eyes The last chance for Spartak Bragin has the ball! The goalkeeper saves the team! Bragin kicks the ball really high, almost in to outer space! as far as he can, away from the gates. That's all, my friends. The final whistle is here. Meteor is a winner of the Cup of Russia! This guys surpassed the Moscow Spartak in Finals. They were loosing at first 0 : 2, but the final score is 3:2 Something that you will never see again, because Meteor put his name in the history! I don't know how you lived this evening, but I lived it to the fullest! Today I am totally convinced that the Football is more than just the game! It is the life of this people. The Cup of Russia will be going to Novorossiysk! And Meteor is going to play on the European football fields It will be representing Russia in the prestigious European Tournament Arustanyan was broadcasting for you. This is all, that I leave behind after I am gone This is all that will matter to take along with me This is all, that I leave behind after I go This is all that will matter to take along with me The Coach The Football is not a question of life and death It is more important than that.
