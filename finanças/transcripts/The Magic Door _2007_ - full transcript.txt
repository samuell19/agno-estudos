(MultiCom Jingle) (dramatic orchestral music) (thunder booming) (dramatic orchestral music) (grunting) - Nice and steady that's it. Really, now I've got a cold. (blowing nose) You still here then? Haven't moved. I can't stay chatting all night I've got dinner to catch. What's the point in having brothers made out of stone? It's worse than having a sister, and that's bad that is, (laughing) that is bad. - Flip come here. (mysterious music) (wings flapping) - Your Majesty. - Cut that out. Tell me what you found out. - Well, he's lonely. - I know that. I want to know what he's been up to. - Nothing. - Nothing? He must be up to something. His exile is almost up and he only gets this one chance every 100 years. - As far as I can figure out, he isn't doing anything. - Well, if he doesn't want end up like his brothers he better do something. (thunder cracking) I'm going back, watch him and let me know what he gets up to. - Why me? I ain't got no beef with Raglin. - No but you owe me. If you don't want to join him in exile you'll do as I say. (magic booming) (wings flapping) (growling) - Rats. Stupid fairy. - I heard that. (growling) (magical booming) (dramatic orchestral music) (thunder booming) - Chicken, any chicken? Of course there isn't, knowing my luck it'll be cold beans and sausage. Oh, I can't believe it. I don't believe it. (grunting) Got ya. (laughing) (dramatic orchestral music) - Hello what's your name? Look at the mess that you've made. Don't go, who are you? (whooshing) (dramatic music) - No. Not again. George, George, George! Look. - God's sake, Liam get out here now. - But he didn't do it. - Oh really then who did? - The little troll. - Oh please. - Sally not again. Liam come out here and help us clean this up. - But I didn't do it. - Help us anyway. - Oh god, what about Sally? - Well Sally didn't do it because she's upstairs. - You don't believe me then? - Well I'm supposed to believe it was a troll? - I didn't say it was a troll, I said it wasn't me. - Honest? - Honest. - Go on then. - No no hang on George, no. He can help, I've had enough of this. - He said he didn't do it. - Oh really. Like he didn't tip insects over my clothes? Like he didn't let the tires down of your car? Like he didn't throw mud over my clean washing? - Get off. - Come back here now. - No. (door closing) (dramatic orchestral music) - Fiendish little twerp. (dramatic orchestral music) (thunder cracking) - Oh Liam. - Well, Raglin likes chickens. Must tell the highness. (yawning) (snoring) (thunder booming) - [Rachel] I think I was too hard on him. - Thank you. Oh come on darling. He's made your life a misery since you got here. - Yeah but he's finding it difficult. He thinks I'm trying to take over from him mom. We'll work it out I guess. We're just gonna have to try harder. I'm gonna go and talk to them. Oh why don't you bring, those up in a minute? (dramatic music) - You're being stupid. - I don't care, I'm going, they don't want me here. - They do, of course they do. - Yeah right, that's why I get blamed for everything. - Well running away won't help will it? Where are you gonna go? - They were acting mean. - Come on Liam, Dad didn't mean it. - Why does he always shout at me? I hate him. (knocking on door) - I've made some rice cakes. - Go away. - We hate rice cake, thank you. (dramatic music) - Look, I'm sorry about earlier. Your dad didn't mean to shout. - Yes he did, he always does. He blames me for everything. - Your father, he's just trying to do his best. And he love you both so much. - Well he has a funny way of showing it. - He wishes we were gone, same with Mom, so he can be on his own with you. - Hey, here we are. Cakes and drinks delivered to the door. That can't be bad eh? What do you think? Okay, okay. I'm sorry, alright? I know things haven't been easy for you. Haven't been easy for us either. Why don't we all try harder to make things work? I'll try not to lose my temper. - And I'll try not to jump to conclusions or to blame you both if something goes wrong, okay? How about it Sally? - Okay. - Liam? - I suppose. (laughing) - Well for that I'd say you deserve the smallest one. - No not the smallest-- - I got you. (laughing) See you later guys, love you. (dramatic music) (growling) (dramatic music) (magical booming) (dramatic music) (whooshing) (magical booming) (growling) - Now where are you Raglin? (growling) Why it is a rabbit here. It ain't no troll. (growling) (magical booming) (magical twinkling) (yawning) - I wonder what he wants. Pesky sort. I can see you, you can't hurt me. No siree no way, no how. Spooky little elf, what does he want eh? You tell me, what does he want? - [Rachel] I've made some chicken. Thought we could have it cold with some salad for a change. - [Sally] Great. - I'm gonna put on some washing have you anything that needs to run? - Yeah my football kit. - Is it in your room? - Yeah. - Okay. - I'm telling you it was him. - So where did he go? - To the woods. - And he knocked over the bin? - Yes god Liam how many more times? - Alright but you're the only one who's ever seen him. - You've seen his tracks. - I've seen footprints. - I'll go on my own then. - I didn't say I wouldn't come. - Are you two going out? - No. - Yes. (thudding) - [Raglin] Tap, I'm good at tapping. I still can't find the door though. (mysterious music) (growling) I only get to look for it every 100 years. You'd think they'd let me find it by now. - You're miles off. (laughing) - The more I look for it the less likely I am to find it. If I don't look for it then I'm not going to find it. (dramatic music) (growling) (dramatic music) - Give us a hand then. - This is stupid. - No it's not. - We'll never find him. - So he isn't real. - Yes he is. - Then we'll find him won't we? - How? - Trust me. I've got a plan all the way. (dramatic music) (magical booming) (wings flapping) (magical booming) (dramatic music) - I told you to watch Raglin, not to spend half your time sleeping. - I wasn't sleeping. - What have you found out? - He's looking for the door. - Well good. He'll never find it, and the more he looks the harder it will be for him to find. - But when his exile's up, you'll have to show him where the door is anyway. - Only if he has done a deed so good that it will undo all the bad things his brothers did. - Why are you so against Raglin coming home? - That you don't need to know. You just do as I say, and you can go back to your lazy little life. Cross me, and I'll leave you here forever. - Okay. (mysterious music) I was only asking. - Well don't. (hissing) (magical booming) (growling) (magical booming) (suspenseful music) (growling) - Fairy magic. I hate it. (growling) (magical booming) (wings flapping) (suspenseful music) (magical booming) (magical booming) The witch, she's a witch. (growling) What is she up to? - The spell is working. The quartz is eating at your flesh. Good, the change has already started. (magical booming) (growling) Once the change is complete even Raglin's magic won't be able to help you. Don't fret my dear soon all your worries will be over. I'll be married to Prince Hamlin. And crowned queen of the fairies and you will be encased in quartz and remain here forever. (laughing) (howling) - Maggie's dress. (magical crackling) (suspenseful music) - These stones look like people, big mean people. So what's the plan? - You said he liked chicken so I thought we'll give him chicken. - Liam, Rachel's gonna kill you. - What if we don't tell her. Besides who cares? - She's not that bad. She's trying really hard to fit in. - So, I don't want her to fit in. - I don't get it, even if he liked chicken how's he going to know it's there? - If this is where you've seen him the most, he must live around here somewhere. He'll smell the chicken and he'll come and look. - He'll never look. - Got any better ideas? (mysterious music) Told you he lived here. (shushing) (mysterious music) - That's darn unnatural that is. (suspenseful music) Flip? You're there, I know you're around. - Who's Flip? - Spooky little devil. If this is a trick? (suspenseful music) (mysterious music) Oh. Heaven. - Hey, that's my chicken. - Says who? - I've heard about you. - You cook it? - No I-- - Well it ain't yours then is it? - I put it there. - Well that was your first mistake. - Stop it. We left the chicken there for you. - Why? - We've seen you down at the farm and here by the stones, at least I have. We just wanted to make friends. - With me? - Yes. - You know I'm a troll don't you? - Yeah right, trolls are giant, they only come out at night. The sun turns them to stone. - How do you know? - It's in The Hobbit. - He's right, that's what happened to all me brothers. - So how come you didn't turn to stone? - I'm too small, not enough sunlight on me skin. If I had more skin then more sunlight would touch me and I would turn into stone, but I haven't so it doesn't. - That doesn't make any sense. - Magic rarely does. (laughing) (dramatic music) - Oh. (dramatic music) - I remember when there were no houses for miles and miles, just a river and the woods. The first humans lived on the hill over there. Bicks they call them, small fierce warriors. - How old are you? - Young in fairy terms but old to you. Though younger than all me brothers. - How many brothers have you got? - Six, I'm the seventh son of the seventh son which is very rare for a troll. - [George] Liam! Sally! - Oh no, they discovered the missing chicken. - Liam, Sally? (dramatic music) Now! - We better go. Can we see you tomorrow? We'll help you look for the door. - Maybe, I'll think about it. (dramatic music) (whooshing) - Raglin? - I think he's gone. - [Liam] If you're the seventh son of the seventh son you got loads of maggots, I read it-- (talking fades into distance) (dramatic music) - You've got a nerve. - We can explain. - Explain what? Why you're making Rachel's life a misery? I thought we had a deal. I thought we were gonna try and make this work. - Stop arguing. - Not this time, they've gone too far. I'm ashamed of you lot, I never thought I'd be ashamed of my own kids. - It's my fault, not Sally's. - I'm not interested, I've heard it all before. Well you win. Obviously we can't live here together so let's try something else, maybe boarding school. - George please, upstairs both of you. This has gone too far. - I don't know what else to do. - Yelling at them and telling them that you're gonna send them away isn't going to make anything better. - I'm sorry. - I've got things to do. (suspenseful music) (owl hooting) - [Liam] It's okay. - Be careful. I've got the ladder ready. (suspenseful music) - Are you sure about this? - You heard him, he doesn't want us here. - You said running away was stupid. - That was before. - Before what? - Before we met Raglin. - And you think he'll be pleased to see us? - Well if he's not we're still not coming back here. (suspenseful music) - Come on. Time to wake up. Come on sleepy head. Get up. - We'll search the woods, I'm sure they can't have gone far. - I'm liable to kill them when I find them. - George. - Not literally of course. - You will find them won't you? - I'm sure we will. We best get going. - Well I'm coming too. - I really don't think-- - No arguments. - Okay. Sergeant. - [Sergeant] Okay everyone let's go. - Stay by a phone just in case they go to a friends. - Okay. I can't help feeling that it's my fault. - Don't, please if it's anyone's fault it's mine. - You won't be cross with them when you find them will you? - No of course not. (dramatic music) Hang on I'm coming. - I'm gonna go inside. (suspenseful music) - [Man] Liam, Sally! (suspenseful music) Sally, Liam! - [Man] Liam! Sally, Liam! - [Woman] Sally, Liam! - Now look what you've done. How am I supposed to look for the door when the wood's swarming with humans. - You said if you look for the door you can't find it. - Don't get smart with me. - Liam! - Sally, Sally! Liam! Liam! Liam! Liam! (growling) - We're being watched. - What, where? - Shh silly, don't let him know, he's in the ivy covered tree over there. - That's Flip that is. He's a spooky little elf. He's been following me for days. - Why? - I don't know but it won't be good. Elves and trolls don't get on, never have. - Maybe we can ask him. I bet you he knows where the door is. (growling) - Ask him, how are we supposed to do that? He never sits still long enough to tell anyone anything. - Well maybe we can make him sit still long enough. I got a plan. (suspenseful music) - I'm late. (magical whooshing) (wings flapping) (dramatic music) (magical whooshing) - At last. - Sorry I was off watching Raglin. - And? - Found himself some friends. - Really? Who? - [Flip] A couple of kids. - Humans? But trolls eat humans. - He could be fattening them up for later. - There's something going on here and I don't like it. It just ain't natural. - Maybe fate has taken hand. - No. She wouldn't dare. - Why not? Her and the princess are really, maybe it was-- - You've been spying on me? - No, no, honest. - I don't have to tell you what would happen if you were to betray me do I? - I wouldn't, honest. (electricity crackling) Let me go please. - Now we understand each other. Get back and split them up. I don't want a troll talking to anyone, understand? (electricity crackling) I said. - Yes I understand! - Good. Good. (magical twinkling) (growling) - I understand all right. You're gonna regret hurting me. (growling) (magical whooshing) - [Man] Liam! - Sally! - Liam! - Sally! (dramatic music) - Liam, Sally! (dramatic music) Any luck? - No sign. - I don't understand. I was sure they'd be playing in the woods, they always play in these woods. - It's gonna be dark in a couple of hours. - You're not going to stop looking? - Well not while there's daylight left, no, but come nightfall we have no option. My men really must rest if they're going to search tomorrow. - Then let's keep looking. Another three hours of daylight. Keep searching. Well come on then. - Okay everybody let's go. - Liam! - Sally! (dramatic music) - Sally! - Liam! - Liam! - Liam! Sally! - [Woman] Sally! (mysterious suspenseful music) Sally! Liam! Liam! Sally! (growling) Sally! (growling) Liam! (mysterious suspenseful music) (growling) Liam! - They couldn't find them. (mysterious music) - My prized feathers. Those catfish who stole Maggie's dress. He'll want these all right. Here we go. - Are you sure he'll try and take these? - Oh yes, elves love bright feathers. They make everything out of them and these, are used to make the flies for the arrows - I don't think I like elves. They're so fierce and dangerous. (laughing) - You don't understand. Elvish arrows don't hurt people in that way. Though they are magic. See, if you use an arrow where the fly is made of one magpie feather whoever they shoot is filled with sorrow. Now if you use an arrow and the fly's made of two magpie feathers whoever they shoot is filled with joy and so on. - It's just like the rhyme. - That's it. - One's for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl. - Four for a boy, five's a wish. - I wish I could make a wish. - Your brother misses your mother very much. - I know, I just wish he would give Rachel a chance. It's not her fault Mom's gone. - I think Liam knows that, you'll just have to give him time. He's a good lad. He'll come to terms with his loss soon enough. - You finished yet? - Just a minute. (suspenseful music) (growling) Shh there he is. (growling) (suspenseful music) - Falling for it, he thinks we're asleep. (shushing) (growling) - Maggie's dress. (suspenseful music) I think it's a trick. If you weren't such a stupid troll. (laughing) (suspenseful music) - He's going for the feathers. (suspenseful music) - Remember, he's a sneaky fast little devil. Only the arrows with the black raven feathers can kill you. The rest will just make you happy or sad or whatever. For the length of a full moon. He'll-- (shushing) (suspenseful music) Stay there. (suspenseful music) Stay there. (suspenseful music) Three, now! (suspenseful music) - Yeah! (growling) - Got you. - Freeze! (magical swooshing) - You saved me. - One for sorrow. Oh quick, the spell won't last long. We need to remove all his arrows and hang this rabbit's foot around his neck. - What good would that do? - It'll stop him flying away, and using his elvish magic. - Liam get those arrows. - That's it, right. (clapping) (shouting) (growling) Got ya. - Nice one. - Yeah. (growling) So you're not gonna tell us why you're here, who sent you, where the door is, or why you keep following me? - Who said anyone sent me? - I did, I know you of old, you're a sneaky little devil. Always spying on something for someone. (growling) - I ain't telling you nothing. - This is getting us nowhere. - Do you think it was the rabbit? - No they don't like rabbits, they don't understand them. They never go anywhere them, nor gray squirrels come to that. - Why? - Well they're all impulse you see, they're not natural to these woods, and they can't seem to come to terms with it, which is stupid really when you think, a rabbit's foot stops elvish magic stone dead. That's how the fairies became the new rulers of Avalon. - But elves used to be the rulers of Avalon. - Yeah. - And now the fairies are? - That's right. - And not for much longer they won't be. - See, after 2,000 years it still rankles. - Well the fairies are in no danger from us. It's themselves they want to worry about. - What is talking about? - I think he's mad. (growling) Drunken elf. - I never heard ate much in my life. - It's good for you. There's nothing wrong in being fat. Tell you what, I'll cook us a big big breakfast in the morning. That'll put some meat on your bones. (laughing) (dramatic music) - Couldn't sleep. They're holding on out there somewhere. - Yeah well you need to get some rest. If you want to be any use to anyone tomorrow. - We weren't too hard on them were we? - I don't think so. I don't know, maybe, maybe we tried too hard. I mean maybe if we hadn't made such a big deal out of everything. Ignored things a bit more and given them more time. - I know. - Come back to bed. (dramatic music) - Just in case they find their way back. (dramatic music) (bird squawking) (mysterious music) - Flip, Flip. - What? - I thought you might be thirsty, and hungry. - Hungry, why hungry? Oh, he ain't fattening me up for no dinner. - You're being silly, you haven't eaten for ages. - Silly am I? Goes to show all you know. Raglin's a troll. Trolls eat meat, any kind of meat, rabbits, people, elves, children. You're all the same to them. (suspenseful music) - Thanks. - You want to tell that brother of yours to watch out. He's been eating nonstop since I got here. - You're lying, Raglin's our friend. - Oh am I? Why do you think him and his brothers were exiled here in the first place? - Raglin told us that the Black Witch betrayed him and blamed him for all the trouble that she caused. - Well he would wouldn't he? He's not gonna tell a prospective meal the truth now is he? - Come on let's go look for the door. - But what about Flip? - Oh he'll be safe enough where he is. - I'll be fine, just watch your step. Tell that brother of yours to stop eating. - Come on. (suspenseful music) No luck. What's wrong? - I was just thinking. - [Liam] I've got some more rabbit if you want some? - In The Hobbit what do the trolls do to be turned to stone? - They just got caught by the sunlight. Bilbo tricked them. - They weren't really going to eat him? - Oh yeah, him and the dwarves. The trolls were gonna make a stew out of them. - Flip says Raglin's going to fatten you up and eat you for dinner. - What, and you believe him? - Well no I'm not sure. What do we really know about Raglin except what he says? - And his brothers have been turned to stone just like in The Hobbit book. - But he seems nice. - What else did Flip tell you? - Nothing, just to be careful. - I think we should stand guard until we get another change to speak to Flip. (laughing) - Searching is hard work. You fancy some lunch? - No, thank you. - No. (dramatic music) (flute music) - What in Pan's name do you think you're doing? - I can't, let me explain. - You think I'm stupid? - No, no honest. Give me a chance. These humans are tricky. They made a trap, but I convinced them that Raglin would eat them. Well I haven't convinced them yet but I will. You said split them up so I am. - What I don't understand is how they got involved in this in the first place. - It's the girl. She's full of latent magic. She can see right through our spells. - Really interesting, does she know? - [Flip] No. - But it does mean she can see the fairy door and she might let the troll know where it is. - It also means if you capture her you could be able to steal her powers. Make yourself stronger. - That's true, all I have to do is make tea from her powdered bones. I'll give you two jobs. (growling) One, make sure the troll doesn't find the door. Two, bring me the girl. - What about the boy? - Let the troll eat him. - And this? (magic twinkling) - It's worthless. You've got three days. (laughing) (magical whooshing) (suspenseful music) (growling) (somber orchestral music) - Any luck? - No. - Okay Sergeant call it off for the day. I'll see you back at the station. - Well hang on wait a minute. - It's gonna be dark soon. Let's go inside and have a chat. (suspenseful music) - What's going on? - I was going to ask you that. - What? - Look we do have two missing children. - I know that. - And we have made a thorough search of the woods and surrounding area and found nothing. Not a trace. (sighing) - What are you implying? (knocking) - Yes? - We found this sir. - Where? - We found it in the woods. - [George] What's that? - [Inspector] Do you know who it belongs to? - No. It's not one of the kids is it? - No, I don't recognize it. - Well have you seen any strangers in the area, has anybody come to the house? Try and think. - Sally said she'd seen, what'd she call it? A troll. - A troll? - Yes, but of course we didn't believe her, we thought she was making it up. - Well yeah. - It did not occur to you that this troll could be a tramp? Somebody living in the woods. - Well I don't know with all that's going on I haven't given it much thought. God no. You don't think this tramp might have hurt them? (gasping) - Now look, we have no proof that this tramp has anything to do with the kids running away. Even if he did we don't know he'd harm them. But I do think we need to widen the search. We need to look beyond the confines of the woods. - Are you two not eating? - We're not hungry. - Do you have any salad or anything apart from meat? - No trolls eat meat, always have and always will. Tell you what, I'll make us a stew. (dramatic music) Give us a hand. I use this to bathe in every 50 years or so. It makes a great pot for stew. (dramatic music) (thunder booming) (dramatic music) (thunder booming) - Sally, Sally. - What? - Shh, follow me. (dramatic music) One word or a cry out, I'll leave you on your own for Raglin to eat understand? (growling) - What're you doing? - We need some answers, but he won't tell us with Raglin around. (dramatic music) Come on. (dramatic music) Okay, what makes you think Raglin wants to eat us? - He's a troll, it's what he does. You've seen the pot. - But he's our friend. - He saved me from your arrow. - I know it's hard to believe, maybe he has changed since he's been in exile. Can you take that chance? - I don't know what to do. (growling) - I know who could help, they know what to do. - Who? - The Fairy Princess. - But she's the one who exiled Raglin in the first place. - I know that. But she's testing him, seeing if he's learned his lesson. Seeing if he's ready to come back. What do you think I'm doing here? I was sent to see if he's ready. What harm will it do? We can be there and back before he wakes. If he has changed, you'll be able to help him find his way home. Come on. Do it for Raglin. - What do you think? - I suppose. - Okay, but you're keeping this on. (growling) (suspenseful music) - Princess! (magical swooshing) Princess! Princess. - Flip, at last you're here. (growling) - I don't like this. - Stay behind me. (magical whooshing) - Liam, get away from her. - What's wrong? - It's a trap she's a witch. (magical whooshing) - Flip? - I told you, she's full of magic. - Freeze. - No! (magical explosion booming) (groaning) (thunder booming) (dramatic music) - What are you doing? - They're out there, I know. I think that something out there in the woods is trying to find them. - I'll come with you. (dramatic music) - Liam? Sally? (thunder booming) Sally? (suspenseful dramatic music) (growling) - Told you. - Run! - Stop! (magical fizzing) Go after them. (magical whooshing) (growling) (magical whooshing) (suspenseful music) - Liam? Sally? (magical whooshing) - What was that? - I don't know, but I didn't like the look of it. Come on. - Sally! - Liam. (suspenseful music) (magical whooshing) (suspenseful music) - What's going on Liam? - I don't know what happened back there but how come you could see the Black Witch and stopped all her magic? - Flip said something about me being full of magic. - Maybe that's why you can see Raglin all the time. Ah, hang on a minute. If you could look hard enough you could see the door. - Yeah if I knew where to look. - If the Fairy Princess is the Black Witch where's the real princess? - I think we need to talk to Raglin. (suspenseful music) (thunder booming) - Where are they? In trouble no doubt. I close me eyes for five minutes and look what happens. What is going on? Something's happening tonight, I can feel it. (suspenseful music) - Which way? - That way. (magical whooshing) (growling) (magical whooshing) (suspenseful music) (thunder booming) (suspenseful music) (thunder booming) - Has she gone? - I think so. - I'm scared, let's go home. - Okay. Stay behind me. (suspenseful music) (magical whooshing) (suspenseful music) (growling) (thunder booming) (suspenseful music) Come on follow me. (suspenseful music) (thunder booming) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (magical whooshing) (growling) (suspenseful music) - Flip. Are you there? (growling) (screaming) Fool. - What's going on? - I don't know, but I'm going to find out. Find those kids. (magical whooshing) (growling) (magical whooshing) - I've had enough of this. (magical whooshing) - What have you done with my children? Where are they, where are they? What have you done with them? What have you done with my children? - George. - Where are they, what have you done with them? - George! That's enough, now put him down. (dramatic music) (thunder booming) - Well I'm sorry. - You will be. - Oh really? - Yeah really. - Well what are you going to do about it big man? - Stop, will you both listen to yourselves? This is getting us nowhere. - Well he won't tell us where the children are. - He said he doesn't know. - And you believe him? - Are you calling me a liar? (magical whooshing) (screaming) - Freeze. (magical whooshing) (suspenseful music) Rats. (suspenseful music) - Just great. Zapped by a witch. I must be slowing down. (thunder booming) (suspenseful music) (magical whooshing) (thunder booming) - I'm gonna regret this. I'd soon have you fairies in charge than the witch. So if it works then you have me to thank. If it fails, then, I'm sorry. (growling) (suspenseful music) (thunder booming) The magic from three arrows should be enough. Here goes nothing. (suspenseful music) (growling) (magical explosion booming) (growling) (coughing) - What took you so long? - Oh, thanks. Being a spy ain't that easy. - Witch.

You did run away didn't you? - I didn't hate him, or Rachel, I was angry that's all. I didn't mean it, you have to help us. - Please Raglin. - I can't, the door. - Let's go. - I thought you were our friend. I hope you have a nice life. - But...

Where's Raglin? - Gone. - Gone where? - Through the door. - He can't have. - Well he has so you might as well let us go. - You're finished. - Am I? You think I'd let a stupid troll spoil my plans? He doesn't even know what my plans are. - [Flip] No, but I do. (dramatic music) - [Sally And Liam] Flip. - So do the fairies. - You told them! - Yeah. And I freed the princess. Now I'm gonna stop you. - Oh yeah, you and whose army? - Mine. (growling) - Whoa. (suspenseful music) - You treacherous little retch I'll imprison you in a jar forever for that. - I don't think so.

(magical whooshing) (growling) - [Liam] Leave him alone. (suspenseful music) - What? What did you say? - I said leave him alone. You're just a bully, but you don't scare me. - Liam. - No, I had enough. What gives you the right to push people around? You're just an ugly old woman with bad breath. - I'm going to boil your eyes, fry your brains and turn you into a toad for that. (mumbling) - And if you do, you'll have change me too. - And me. - And me. - And me. - Raglin. - Raglin, you came back. - Too late. (magical whooshing) - [Liam] No Raglin. - No, Raglin. - No what?

(magical twinkling) (suspenseful dramatic music) - Yes, got you. - Nice one. - Lord Flip. - I didn't know he was a lord. - As a reward for your bravery and loyalty to your friends and princess I make you keeper of the royal seal and champion to the princess. - Thank you Princess. (cheering) - Raglin. You saved us all. Defeated the witch and sacrificed going home for the love of your friends. (dramatic music) How can we ever thank you? - There's no need. In fact I should be thanking you and my young friends. 2,000 years I've been looking for something I didn't realize I already had, a home. This is where I live, this is where I belong. I just didn't realize until Liam and Sally showed me. Now all I ask is that you rule wisely and let all the people of Avalon live in peace. - We'll do our best. (dramatic music) What about you two? (dramatic music) - We'll be going home. - Yes! Sorry what I mean is, oh come here, we are going home. - We're all going home. - Oh. (dramatic music) - But it doesn't mean I'll be good all the time. (laughing) - I wouldn't have it any other way. (dramatic music) - Three cheers for Raglin, hip hip. - [Everyone] Hooray. - Hip hip. - Hooray. - Hip hip. - Hooray. (dramatic music) - Got ya.
