So where does that name come from originally? ls that Ass-tralian? Yeah. Oh, my God, you must have been the butt of every joke. Did you drive an Aston Martin? Alex, we're being asinine. Yes, you are. Don't worry, Dylan. We're still gonna be your best butties. Now, Angels, a rose by any other name still smells as sweet. Thank you, Charlie. lt's not that funny. Yeah, it is. Bos, can l get a ruling on this one? You sure can. You know what? Personally, l'm not interested in Helen Zaas. l'm more concerned about yours. No matter what, you're still gonna be our Dylan. Thank you, Bos. You're welcome. Let me guess, you fell for the bad guy. l fell for the worst guy. But he was so cute, and l liked him so much. We had so much fun together... ...just driving around, listening to metal and.... 8 years ago And then one night, things got really bad. l love you! l would die for you, Seamus! O'Grady. You got some balls. He said he'd kill me if l told anyone, but l had to put him away. Of course you did. You did the right thing. -He was my first. -Really? But you told me you never did it. My first bust. -Yeah. -Who was this guy? -Seamus O'Grady. -O'Grady? As in the lrish mob? l sent him to prison. Right now O'Grady. You're out. O'Grady, what about your belongings? So if l have these, she'll find me? -The O'Gradys killed my parents. -What? Sorry, Max. l testified against them. Wait a second. Alan Caufield. He testified against the O'Gradys. That's it. The O'Gradys must have HALO. This is our one lead. The Thin Man. -Our favourite assassin. -That's right. This needs to go get analysed. Yes, let's get up in there and do that. Let me see it. Yeah, l know exactly what this is. l have one. The nuns gave it to us at the orphanage. Orphanage. -Good work. -Max is in our protective custody now. It's up to us to k eep him safe. Hey, l know the safest place in town. Listen, don't you worry about a thing. No O'Grady ever set foot in South Central. Can you dig it? -Yeah. -This is my mama house. Rule number one: Don't look her in the eye. Understand? Or she'll pop. Can you dig it? -Bosley. -Yes, ma'am? You get over here. Hey, Mama. What kind of trouble you in now? l'm not in any trou-- Yes, ma'am. -Come on. -Yes, ma'am. -Look at those knockers. -Boys! Mother superior will see you now. Mother, do you recognize this man? Of course l know who he is. We called him Anthony, after St. Anthony of Padua... ...healer of the mute. Please come forward. Please, girls. But his real name, like so much about him, was a mystery. He came to us when he was 7. He was found wandering in the hills, living off roots and insects. w e believe his family was in a Romanian circus troupe... ... who died in a terrible fire. Although the doctors could find nothing physically wrong... ...he never spok e a word. And there were other idiosyncrasies. He was a painfully shy child... ... until it came time for his monthly haircut. ... until it came time for his monthly haircut. Then one morning, he was simply gone. The Thin Man was protecting Max. So you're saying this man is the sole benefactor of your orphanage? Yes, he really is an angel. Mother, have you had contact with him since? Well, not really that much... ...except for the odd haircut now and then. But he does send gifts. Like this morning. -Emmers' car. -That is a nice ride. An original 1967 numbers-matching GTO. -Thorn Birds. -l know. Bird poo. What order did you girls say you were from again? -Larus californicus. -California gull.

What are you doing here? l'm Alex's boyfriend. Alex's boyfriend. Yeah. Well, technically, we're on what she calls a time-out. What does that mean? Exactly. Thank you. Yeah. l gotta say, you must be the world's most understanding father. -Why? -All the wild stuff she does. When l first met Alex, l thought she was a bikini waxer. lt was months before l knew about Charlie. Who's Charlie? San Pedro Harbour Merkin. That was the name of Seamus' pit bull. Armed guards. Security looks pretty tight. This dock is like a fortress. lD badges. l think cargo's our best bet. -Townsend Agency. -Bos, recon incoming. -Got you, baby. -Yeah, check the photo. That's our man.

Who do you think invented the McRib, Lucky Charms, huh? Shamrock Shake? That's ours. Give me your papers. -What? -Your papers. Let me tell you... ...you got nerve to ask me about my papers. My family suffered, man, for lack of potatoes. Foot-and-mouth disease. Canker sores. Circumcision. -Circumcision? -Right, my wife just had a set of twins. -Both leprechauns. -Leprechauns? Get a whiff. lrish Spring. You don't believe that, wipe your ass with a four-leaf clover. McGinty! Get this stuff on the ship. -Tough, eh? -That was heavy. l say we should take a break. Wait a second. l smell a rat. This ring is pure platinum. The HALO rings are titanium. HALO data chips should be weightless... ...surrounded by a hollow core that prevents thermal induction. lf the density of the object... ...is less than that of the substance in which it is immersed.... lt floats. There they are. l'm sure Helen Zaas was great, but l just can't imagine life... ...without Dylan Sanders. -Come on, let's get out of here. -Cheers to that. What's the rush, Helen? What's the rush, Helen? You've only been here five minutes. Now, l've waited for you before. Matter of fact, l've waited for you 2920 days. That's 417 weeks. That's 96 months. That's eight years. Enough about me. What about you, Helen? How have you been? Seamus. l see you still got a nice arse on you. You got a lot of nerve stealing from me. Stealing back's more like it. Give us the rings. Give us the rings. Give us the rings! Don't lose those. We'll be taking them back in about... ...48 seconds. l've been dreaming one day l'd get to see you again... ...and watch you die. Keep dreaming. Lights. Somebody get the lights! Seamus. Seamus! Seamus! You know l always like it with the light on. You don't know me anymore. l'm the only one here who knows you.

Don't let them get away! Got it? Come on, now! Let's go. Dylan, let's go.

Mustard? lt's Professor Plum... ...in the conservatory, with a candlestick. That's right. You got it right. -Damn! -How the hell you know that? We took in one just like him a long time ago, remember? Yeah, Mama, l remember. You gave my room away. You were the cock? l was the beaver. What are the chances that we were both mascots? -Unbelievable. -Oh, God. lt's like we were made for each other. The best l can figure it is, the clients contact Charlie directly. Okay, then he phones the girls. They show up at the place and do their thing. Now, l know, l know. At first, l didn't think l could handle it. The late nights, the never knowing when she'd have to go out on a job. Some of the men are pretty dangerous. And the outfits.

There's just something l gotta ask. -Oh, boy. -Yeah. 'Oh, boy' is right. So here it goes. -Twirl me first. -Okay. Yeah. Hey! About that question, Pete? Let's talk about it later.

The Justice Department, the DA's office, the FBl. U.S. Marshal. That's Carter. l never gave rings to a guy before. The rings are secure, sir. And we can all breathe a little easier. -well done, Angels. -Thanks, Charlie. HALO is safe, thanks to you. lt's been a pleasure. l hope to work with you ladies again. But not too soon. Good luck with everything. Your keys. -What is it? -My ribs. These aren't mine. That was a nice reach for a guy with a couple of fractured ribs. Good going, Bos. -We got him. -We got who? Of course, he already had one ring. He just needed the other. He wanted to fake his own death so he wouldn't be a suspect. Who you all talking about? He needed time for his plan, so he set up Seamus. Then turned him loose on Dylan. I think you're onto something, Angels. Damn! So Carter's the bad guy! It's just speculation at this point, Bosley. w e need proof. -Keys, Bosley. -Let's hit it. Punk. Road's clear. You're good to move in. Almost there. Oncoming. Good job, Alex. -Can we go yet? -No, you can't, son. l gotta make sure it's safe. We're gonna be late.

Run. Get on out of here. Come on. Get on out of here. -Great job, Bos. -Yeah, right. Carter's working with a partner. They're selling the list tonight. We'll take care of them and then find Dylan. -See you, Bos. -Yeah, all right, all right. This is some bullshit. -Kelly Garrett. -Hello, Dylan. Don't you have a case to solve? Well, l tried to outrun my past, but it caught up with me yesterday. And l put my friends in danger. They're in more danger now without you. Natalie and Alex are gonna replace me with someone great. A real Angel. Not someone who's pretending to be something she's not. Your past is what makes you who you are, Dylan. Don't forget that Charlie chose you for a reason. Angels are like diamonds. They can't be made. You have to find them. Each one is unique. Sometimes we search too hard for answers that are right in front of us. The buyers are set. We did it, partner! You know, l never really got that partner thing. Hello, Angels. Madison Lee. Why? Why be an Angel when l can play God? Looks like one of the three amigos has gone adi?s. Welcome back, Dylan. You're such a typical rebellious Pisces. Always out to prove how tough you are... ...and you couldn't make it one day on your own, could you? Someone reminded me that every Angel is unique. And l knew it was you. Who else had contacts in Mongolia... ...could hack the HALO fail-safe and hire a surfer as an assassin? Same astrological phenom who would refer to a motocross rider... ...with a lion on his helmet as ' Leo.' Very well done. Very impressive, really. You've got it all figured out. And now l'm gonna really enjoy... ...knocking those halos right off your heads. But you're an Angel. No. You just don't get it. l don't take orders from a speaker box anymore. l work for myself. Well, your boss sucks. The Angels' ass-kicking pose. Seeing the three of you like that... ...does give me this little twinge of nostalgia for the old days. But back then, it was a little bit different. You see, when l was an Angel... ...we used guns. Sorry, Charlie. Hello, Angels. Good evening, Charlie. l love the new office. Madison, is that you? where are the Angels? l'm sure there's three more where they came from. Madison, what have you done? We're just having a little fun. You shouldn't worry yourself, Charlie. You've never had trouble... ...finding someone to give their life for you. Hurting the Angels doesn't prove you're the best. You know that. Do l? Madison, you were never able to accept that this agency... ... is about teamwork. w e're a family. we do-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, l know. Angels forever. l've heard the sales pitch. lt was very seductive... ...once. Madison, you deliberately went rogue on the DeSoto case... ...and put your fellow Angels in danger. when we finally got you out of there... ...you were wounded so badly, we thought we might lose you. You did lose me. You see, being an Angel wasn't fulfilling my destiny. lt was keeping me from it. Your destiny is yet to be written. Do not do this, Madison. Taking the lives of innocent people is not the answer. There must be something in you that's still good. l was never good. l was great. Damn. What a bitch! You guys, we have to outthink Madison. No matter what we do, she's always two steps ahead of us. -She's selling the list off tonight, 8:00. -But where? -Nat, what else did Carter say? -Okay. 'Take the stars beyond the galaxy.' lt's safe to say it's on this planet. 'Take shore to hope and stop on a stair.' There's a Hope Street downtown. But no shore for miles. A stair. Astaire! Astaire? Astaire! -Possible concussion. -l'm worried. Guys, the stars. Hollywood Walk of Fame. Beyond the Galaxy Theatre. There's Dinah Shore, Bob Hope and Fred Astaire. -Nice, Nat. -Yeah! l think she's trying to kill us. l can't believe it. We are here in Hollywood. -Angels? -l knew we were gonna do it-- -Shut up, damn it! -What? l mean, not you, Mama. Sorry. Have you lost your mind? Yeah. l mean, no. We gonna talk about this later. Diablo Cartel Tanaka Yakuza Antonioni Crime Family -Welcome to the Guinness World of-- -Shut it. Give us the map. Yahtzee! Jason! Jason! Jason! l love you! l hear the sequel's insane. First one was a classic. Button your jacket. -What? -Button your jacket. The VlP gathering is on the top floor. You're under arrest for conspiracy to obstruct justice. Freeze! The Kleinhardt gambit. Classic. And apparently still effective. We never used to wear Kevlar till l took three in the chest. On the DeSoto case! We know! Don't tell me you forgot about... ...plan B. l'd recognize that arse anywhere, you piece of sh--! Bring it on, bitch. Say something. Mind if l cut in? No! ? P@rM!NdeR M@nk?? ? ? P@rM!NdeR M@nk?? ? ?

The premiere should be a blast. Bosley, plan B! lt's raining white women! Plan B stands for ' plan Bosley.' Yeah! Get that bitch! Get that bitch! Wow. They really went all out for this thing. Okay! Dylan! Alex! This is it. You ready? Are you? Kill... ...or be killed. Exciting, isn't it? Who are you? You want to know who l am, Natalie? Then you look inside your own heart. No, Madison. l'm nothing like you. l have something you'll never have. And what's that? Friends. -Enjoy heaven. -Go to hell. She is so fired. Party time. -Angels! -Bosley! Angels! -You all get that squirrel-flying lady? -Yeah! -Did you scratch her? -Yeah! You kick her? You kicked her kung fu ass? Mama, l told you! l know it! -We couldn't have done it without you. -Never! -You hear that, Mama? -l heard it. l've always known my baby boy was a genius! Why you give my room away, then, Mama? l'll tell you why. Max? Yeah? l'm a Bosley now! -Max Bosley! -l love Max Bosley! -Boy, you did it! -Hallelujah! Daddy! One second. Daddy! Darling! You made it! We just got done. Another satisfied client. We finished her off sooner than we thought. -Her? -lt was a woman this time. We had to triple-team her, but we finally got her on her back! Well done! No, no, no! -Jason! -Alex. You made it. No, no, no! l know. We're on a time-out, l know. Time-out's over, baby. We're back in the game! Ferret. l know you wanted to wait and everything, but-- -You really look beautiful. -Thanks, Pete. l've been wanting to ask you this for a long time. So here goes. Pete. -Spike? -Yeah. A puppy. A puppy? -ls that okay? l know it's a big step. -Yes! l already got him. -You did? -Yeah. Dylan! Dylan! Guess what. Pete and l have something to tell you. -Really? -We're gonna get-- -You're gonna get what? -A puppy! -A puppy! That's great! -Yes. -l already got him. -You did. -Awesome! -His name is Spike! So you're not leaving? No! Of course, you guys. l get to kick butt with my two best friends. You think l'd give that up? No! What about you, Dylan? With O'Grady out, you can go back to your old life. Are you kidding? This is my life. What about you, neurosurgeon? lt's a no-brainer! l love our family! l love our family! God! And l know we agreed to take things slow. -Yeah? -But.... -You-- -Sorry. There's an ember in my ass. We should get this to the lab and analyse it. Yeah, just crawl right up in there. l have. l like the patch. Let me see your patch. Hello? ls this Natalie?
