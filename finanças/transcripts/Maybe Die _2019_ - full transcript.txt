Well, we finally fucking did it and we are going to Japan. The Roosters are basically a group of five friends that ride fixed-gear bikes. We don’t get any outside help and we carry only what fits in our messenger bags. We have Nacho, who is the most enthusiastic person I know. Aukerman, who was in charge of the sponsorships and all of that. Carlos, who is group’s calming presence Mario Cranks, who is the youngest of the group and also partially in charge of promoting us visually. Later we have Delvis, who truly puts the heart in the team. It all began in Emakers, where Nacho, Delvis, and I were working as bike messengers. I made a comment to the guys about wanting to take a trip to see my girlfriend, Elena, in Bordeaux. And we started to figure out a plan for how to get there, who would come along, etc. Japan was never in anyone’s plan. The idea has always been to make each trip a bit more challenging, but to go to Japan was like..that’s way too far. I started to look stuff up and I saw that there was like a bike across Japan on bike. There was a race called Japanese Odyssey in which you take road bikes across Japan, like we did. But after checking it out, it wasn’t our style. And it wasn’t like we could just go in two months. And obviously, it didn’t work out. Later, it really was Jaime who was fighting for Japan and very persistent about it. Because the rest of us were moving away from that idea a bit. It seemed too far away and too big for what we really are or were during this time. Of course later when we started to look at the landscapes Japan could offer us, it suddenly became an obsession. Let’s go for this! From here we began to get more motivated to go on this trip to Japan and it started to take shape. It was when we started to come together and work side by side tracing routes. Our initial route was much more limited than what we were going to do. Later, we realized that if we did that route we wouldn’t have much time to enjoy. It was mostly me, Carlos, and Nacho who had to check out the downsides of each route and figure out how we could improve them. What we were looking for, aside from going across Japan, was to pass through the most beautiful parts and to get to know the people. In the end, I believe it was the right choice to let ourselves enjoy everything and for me it was the icing the cake. After landing in Tokyo we took a train towards Niigata where we would we start to pedal to Kashiwazaki. From Kashiwazaki we would go to Itoigawa and to Igasi. From Igasi to Shirakawa - Go, where we would enter the alps. We would pass through Gujo, Ohaki, Ogaki, Hikoni, and finally we would arrive to Kyoto. From Kyoto we would go to Nara. From Nara to Osaka. From Osaka, we would take the train to Takamatsu to get to a new island. We would pass through Nihama. From Nihama to Yawatahama, where we would take another ferry to take to Beppu, a new island. The next stage would be from Beppu to Ubuyama and finally we would arrive at Mount Aso, our final destination. A volcano on the south island of the Japanese archipelago. 15 days earlier there was a volcanic eruption that left 15 dead and the island devastated due to nature's power. Finally, we were ready to go. We had breakfast in La Bicicleta. We’re going to the airport. And our trip started exactly when we put the boxes on the conveyor belt. Well I think that the first hours in Japan were kind of like you don’t know if you are really there or not. Suddenly, you land in Tokyo and we get on the metro and you say damn! Suddenly it’s like you are in a Manga comic. We saw signals of a panda that showed you how to be careful on the train platform. You couldn’t believe it, I mean, it seemed unreal that this day had arrived and that we were in Japan. You arrive to a huge city, after an hour or so in train, where no one speaks your language. I don’t know, everything is so different and we arrive we the Shibuya station and Aitor and I are on bridges, looking at buildings, taking photos, photos that don´t mean anything. But you have to stop to think Fuck, I am here! When we were in the station, we wrote to Junpei, who was our Japanese contact we met through Instagram, and they tell us they will come get us and we are like, okay, great, perfect! 1000 Japanese guys arrive, well more like 10, or I don’t know, maybe 8. They tell us, come on, put your bikes together and right there in the middle of the Shibuya train station, we start putting our bikes together and getting everything together. We caused such a scene that people started forming a circle around us. They took us to a typical, Japanese bar with small tables and no other option but to sit there and eat a little salad I don’t know if it was seaweed or what but you ate it was chopsticks. It was a wild night! I think we had like 70 beers. We created a connection that we will be eternally grateful for because they picked us up at the station, took us to different spots, and to eat dinner… And our first encoutners in Tokyo were like that, with bike messengers from there, all of them nice dudes, drinking beer all day. These were truly some incredible days. Riding bikes through the city and enjoying everything without worrying about the kilometers or the route or about anything at all. We just followed Junpei and his crew wherever they took us and we spent the day trying new stuff and just enjoying. I really enjoyed those days but I felt like a yearning or a desire to start the route to see what it would bring us. Estaba ahí un poquito nervioso. Our first time on the Japanese highway was really pretty nice. I remember when we rode along the coast and we stopped at a convenient store to get breakfast. In a 7 Eleven that was our main source of fuel during the trip. This is rice, right? It’s already been cooked, no? No, no it hasn’t been cooked yet. Yeah, man it totally looks like it has been cooked, right? But still it should be heated up. The truth is that I feel stuffed but I am craving something sweet. Right when we started to ride all together, with new gear, new bikes, pedaling together again after almost a year of not taking a trip is when you say, wow! For me, it was magic. Pure bliss. During the first moments when you realize where you are and what you are going to do. They are very moving on a personal level and as a group. To know that you are pedaling towards a destination, that you are going to get to where you need to go. Everything was going smoothly and it was a feeling of like, Fuck! We are actually here and we are going to make it to the end. Well dude…tomorrow I'll start taking it. Or later, as soon as we eat, I'll take it. From now on I am going to call it the “Michelos.” No no, it's the next Michelin. Yesterday you fell out of your hammock, right? Well yeah, it was Nacho's fault, he is jinxed. He gets in the sleeping bag, the hammock is holding you up and then it starts to swing and I go you are going to eat shit I made sure to keep watching and watching and BOOM! Directly to the ground. The hammock flipped over. A gnarly fall! It was awesome. Look! Damn! It looks so good on him! Wooo, dude! You badass! You're total flower power, dude. And it even matches with your Oakley's. Slow down! - Let's ride chill. Okay, okay we were going all fast. Like this, look, at this speed we are totally fine. Yeah, I think so. I thought you guys were telling me not to go faster than 40 km/hr. Was cool. Look at how pretty it is! With the open tunnels and the fucking sea. What else do you need? I love when you go through the fucking tunnel, the closed ones, not the rad ones with the panoramic views in the closed ones, you always pedal harder. In the closed tunnels all you hear is shit and you say well alright then. The closed tunnels were really shitty. He says, today and for the rest of the week there's nothing but rain. And later he says, I am going to be right, man, just chilling here under the leaves of the banana tree. When you're talking about going 30 plus km without stopping… The temperature helps a lot, dude. When it's not hot, riding is rad. Now, it's like 7 in the evening and it's almost night already. We have time to take a nap and everything. It's cool. I think this schedule is awesome, I love it. I am really happy with how we have organized everything. Yeah. I love staring at the fire it puts me in a trance looking at it. Yeah, man. It is something that you aren't aware of in the subconscious, sorry. The unconscious is well said. Because this means that you're alive. That means... Que tenemos aviones. There were various times when we didn't make it to the place we were supposed to we got lost many many times we didn't get to the right place. Yeah but this time isn't the same thing, dude. Also, this is the best trip we have planned. This one is really organized. Here, I'll give you another 8. No, no. You can throw it in that hole where there isn't fire but there are embers. The situation is like there are many highways, so, what I want to see is the alternatives. Right now, for example, we can leave through the highway behind us and cross, but we don't need to go back. So before we head out, I want to see exactly where this route goes. The first hard section of the route was the first climb which was we started to go through the Alps. We came up against a climb that we didn't expect at all. God dammit! I have never climbed something so tough. It wasn't like in Europe with many curves and a winding path. No no it was like a Zip Zag. We started to climb and climb and it was like a stretch of 20km and all of the sudden we didn't expect that there would be such a climb. Let's go, dudes! We got this! Come on, Auker! Well, never in my life have I had such a hard fucking time I think it was the first tough climb that we had. We were there like fuck, it's struggle to push the wheel forward at all. It was a climb that had between a 12 and 15% grade. It was like facing a giant wall. I said, damn we still have a lot to go and I threw my hands in the air I saw all the guys in front of me going around the curve I hadn't even started that curve. They were way ahead of me. It was pretty hard for us. It really took it out of us. But whatever, it taught us to find a good climbing rhythm and visualize how we were going to make it through. We made it through bigger climbs, although later sections were much harder. But the that first climb definitely caught us a little off guard. The thing is that I loved it. In the end, it was what Ilked most. It was cool, but also hard. Chill, chill, James. What I like most about Japan is that the workers dress like the Beastie Boys. And the bathrooms too, I like those a lot. Go, dudes, we have to ride 60km before it starts to rain. The traditional Ryokan house where we stayed was awesome I think it was the most traditional place we stayed during the whole trip. Ahh! Yes, yes it's hot! Here you have dudes what is this? This is to fill this with water. Is it good? -Yeah, it's good. It tastes like Ganchitos. Look, we have toothbrushes. But dude we have to pay for that and it doesn't even have a mattress. It's the shit! And this? - Ah this is for Lino to wear later. What is this for? - For sleeping. Oh a Kimono! Kimono! This goes in the back I knew that it was a kimono, it totally looked like one. Like this? Yeah but you always have to fold it perfectly. - It is fucking awesome like this. Give me a towel to put inside. I did that before. Seven seconds, I'll give you seven seconds. I am being generous. Five, five. - Come on, five - Are you sure? Do it, I am going to time you - Are you sure? I am super sure - Are you sure? You're going to lose. You have to swallow all of it, okay? Seven seconds, I know that I´m not going to have enough time, but whatever. What do you mean? No. Come on, let's leave it at 7 seconds, okay? Seven seconds of pure joy 3, 2, 1, zero! Faster, faster, faster, chew! Go, go go! - The timekeeper is not working, but whatever. Throw it out - It is not counting. No no, I am eating it. No, no. It wasn´t counting, dude. Bro, there is a strategy to it, but 7 seconds doesn't give you enough time. No. They are assholes, dude, assholes. We rode 30 km today... - And they fucked us over. There they were, they stopped us. The police stopped us. Very interesting... - They told us, stop there. And we were like no, no we are going to turn to the right and they were like no, no come here. There was one who was like the Atomic Ant and five other policemen. They asked for our passports and they took all of our information. All this because we didn't have fucking brakes. Yeah all because we didn´t have brakes. And they showed us a bit about how to ride here. - Basically. They gave us a whole plan and explained it to us. The Atomic Ant wanted to fuck us over for sure. Luckily, one of them like cycling and Miguel was there to save our asses. He was saying that we had raced in the Tour de France and the Giro. That we were “very very famous cyclists from Spain”. And in the end, it worked, we saved ourselves. But now we are on the way to Kyoto. Yeah, because if we got back on our bikes, they would for sure fine us they warned us that we had to walk our bikes to the station. We didn't want to mess with them and fuck up our trip because of a ''little fine''. Dreamland was a trip inside of a trip, suddenly you go inside and see how nature had taken over. They told us that there were security guards inside and there was a huge fine for trespassing. So we were a bit scared to go inside, but obviously we had no other choice but to enter and check it out, right? We started to go in the park, really slowly… And all of the sudden, you heard a loud bang and we all went running scared shitless, except Mario. I heard music and thought Shit! Why is there music here? And a dude appeared who was riding a skateboard through the park. And I went to talk to them. I remember that it was a guy from Canada another American guy, and a girl from Japan. They were telling me that there weren't cameras and that we could do whatever we wanted because it was totally abandoned. It was absolutely amazing to see it and you think right now, this place is mine. Well, today we are switching out our bikes for a roller-coaster. We are waiting for the ride to start. Buckle up, it is about to go. Put on your roller coaster face! The Keirin in Nara was another awesome coincidence of our trip. We were about to leave Nara and we happened to pass by a velodrome. It looked closed, it only had the main door open, but it wasn't open to the public. We went inside and saw a training session and we were like “Damn that's pretty!” There were also girls training and suddenly they kicked us out. There were also girls training and suddenly they kicked us out. When things got tough, you knew that soon it would be the best. We were getting ready to continue on our way, when one of the trainers came out to see who we were. We explained to him who we were and because he was an honorable man, he said. This really is y'all's passion, huh?” Then he said, “Come on in.” We wanted to enter to check it out from the outside. They let us inside of the locker rooms and then it was like…Fuck! Is this real? To be able to see the Keirin's inner-workings, the tatami locker room with all of the bikes, the Kalavinka, the Nagasawa hung up. They ride with the Knog speedometer. We were shocked when all of the sudden they asked us if we wanted to go to the track and ride with them. We began to take off the stuff on our bikes and I went first and started to take laps and laps. It was one of the most beautiful moments, not only of the trip, but one of the best moments I have had in the last couple of years. It was the most intense four laps in a velodrome that I have ever experienced. It was only going to be a quick visit, not even to see them training, and then we would go on our way. We happened to be able to ride with the Keirin people which isn't something that everyone gets the opportunity to do. Enter and take a lap with us and it was like…it was incredible. Our stay in Osaka, which was like a day and a half or two days at the most. It just happened to be that the dudes from Macaframa were doing a tour in Japan and South Korea. We saw on social media that Macaframa would be in Osaka on the same say that we were. Macaframa, a fixed gear group from San Francisco, has always been a reference for us. They have been a big part bringing fixed gear bikes to the streets. They are idols for many people, us included. We went there and the dudes appeared and told us to come inside with us, guys. We bonded and at the end it sort of became a party between Macaframa and the Roosters. They were there telling their story, but we were together the entire night until we left because the next day we had to continue our trip. Everyone was super nice, they came to try to talk with you although you didn't speak English. Mario even drew “the Roosters” on one of their backpacks. They immediately treated you like someone who is doing something important and, for me, that was really cool. Most of the time, you think that ''famous'' people will think they are better than you but in the end they were just like everyone else. We are going to get ticks. Come on, Nachete! Without fear. He got in the water with his glasses on! - Your glasses, dumbass! It's chilly, eh! Welcome to another day at Lawson! Follow me! This is my friend Laura. We have really cheap cans of beer. They're going to tell us off soon. It's going to be funny when they yell at us in Japanese and we don't understand a damn thing. Here are some carmels that are really yummy that I would recommend. No, they don't have those ones, but these are good too. Maybe they'll kick us out, maybe they won't… Here are some fish-flavored chips that you shouldn't eat because they are really gross. What we eat everyday - where is it? It isn't over here, it's over there. Ah wait wait. This is really cool. The porn magazines are sealed and you can't open them, but you can do this and still see everything! This is a science, god dammit! At the beginning, we ate them so much that I couldn't eat them anymore but today I am eating them again because of the economic situation we are suffering. And they're from yesterday, so they're 40% off. This comes out to less than half a Euro. It has a tecnique. I do it! - Yeah! Seaweed… Im going to get dizzy, for sure. I am going to barf on deck. I have to use nautical terms. You don't think it's cool or what? - I prefer the other one. We are quite hygienic eh… One thing I just thought of, maybe we should get masks. What bliss eh? - Right? - It's awesome. Japan is cool, huh? It has its downsides. Radio: Did they build the baseball field on Mars or what? What did he say? Give me to Mario. Mario, you bastard! What are you saying? I am going in the car. Tell me something, tell me something nice. Asshole, let it go! Sing me a lullaby. I hope it has good views - the best! Mount Aso in front. There is full moon tonight. - It's true there's a full moon. If you don't take a timelapse today, I'll stab you! Aso was the final point of our journey. I look back on it with a lot of emotion and respect. It summed up the everything that had happened before. - We knew that it was like a 14 or 15 km climb, with a lot of elevation. But we had no idea how it was going to be visually. When you finally see it in person. It's like Damn! I came for this. I have just enough energy to climb this. Our route went through the town of Aso, 10 km, then climb to the volcano and then back down. You could see cracks in the road... And dude the truth is that it made you aware that you were in a sysmic zone that had had a big earthquake very recently. We were under a level 2 evauation risk, with a level 3 everyone must evacuate. We started to climb it and you said if this erupt, we are fucked. We aren't going to put ourselves and our bikes in the car. We wouldn't fit. We saw a sign, and just passed it. We continued climbing, us on our bikes, and the car shooting video of us, bigger cracks, an incredible mountain and we had a tail wind pushing us up it. We had gone up like 7 km and we were on fire. , Buah! We got this! And suddenly, we see a man up ahead holding two neon sticks in the shape of an X. And our trip sort of ended there. We couldn't believe that only 7 km left until the top, to complete our trip, and that they wouldn't let us pass. It´s only 8 or 7 km left. No no. they are telling you that there was an earthquake and you can't go up - I'm only asking. Yeah, he says that it's messed up and complicated. And only to take a bit of video? Without bikes? Nope, nothing, dude. It was a letdown time in general. Because you don't actually know what the fuck is happening here. Why can't we go up? It isn't that dangerous. We have only 7 km left. What is going to be different in the next 7 km? The truth is that this was a huge disappointment. With only 7 km left to the top, to see practically all of Japan from above. We felt a bit down. It was a tough moment. You're hit with a huge disappointment unlike anything you've experienced during the whole trip and you feel really low. It's a big let down. But really it was a moment to pause, to spend some time sitting by yourself and thinking about what we had accomplished to get here. We had gone 1200 km across Japan on fixed gear bikes, carrying all of our stuff, and we had made it to this point, in which you couldn't continue because it was unsafe. It was only really 7 km that we couldn't complete, but we had made it this far. It shouldn't have been a big surprise. This is a volcano that could or could not erupt. -It´s is because of the earthqueake -Yesterday, a guy told us that it was dangerous. Fuck man, what a bummer. It's such a let down, dude. Everything, everything is a fucking let down. Look, we have been bitten by mosquitoes, rained on, we have made it through cold ass times, we have been hungry, we have survived on food from Lawson's, we have made it through the heat. - Lawson's has been a pleasure, eh! The only thing that cheered us up was when Nacho saw an Akita dog because they always surprised him. Finally we are here after making it through all that shit we crossed 3 fucking islands and we come up against a man who won't let us ride our last 7km to the crater. Because there was an earthquake that caused much alarm, everything is like Oh no no! The police stopped and almost gave us a fat fine. Afer all this, they tell us that we can't go up. We made it here and we would have made it to top with energy to spare. After all of the hardships that we have gone through, it seems impossible to end our trip here, but whatever. It is what it is, and things will always work out, no? - But we did it, despite the last 7km - and from here it all flattens out.
