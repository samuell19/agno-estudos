[soft instrumental music] [Soldier] Charge! [gunfire blaring] [men screaming] [gunfire blaring] [bomb blasting] [men screaming] [bomb blasting] -[gunfire blaring] -[men screaming] -[bomb blasting] -[men screaming] -[bomb blasting] -[men screaming] [melancholy strings music] [melancholy strings music] [melancholy strings music] Sergeant? Sergeant? Stretcher bearer! Stretcher bearer! [melancholy strings music] -[gunfire blaring] -[men screaming] [soft instrumental music] We have to be 10 times better just to be equal. [uplifting choral music] * Oh send his precious peace * * To my soul * * To my soul * * Who send his precious peace * * To my soul * * To my soul * [gunfire blaring] [choral humming] So, how are you feeling today? Better. Stronger. That's my answer definitely. You don't look it. Why thank you brother. Among my letters yesterday there was. I know. An honourable discharge, there's no shame, Walter. They've not discharged me Eddie. They've offered me the chance to train as an officer. You're hardly out of your sickbed Walter. I'm fine, I'm fine. You had trench fever. You were sick enough for them to send you home. Well I'm fine now. You're going to say no of course. I've never seen an officer that, well, looks like us before Eddie, have you? Isn't this something we should be thinking about? No. Come on. Pa always said aim for the top. Be second to no man. You were second to no man on the football pitch. It didn't stop them booing you, dropping you, selling you. They're asking me to do my bit. They are asking you to risk your life again Walter. You think you can survive that again? [soft instrumental music] [Soldier] Attention! Gentlemen, welcome to Gailes. My name is Captain Coombes and I will be in charge of your office training for the next four months. By the time you leave here you will be the most superior of men. Now I know one or two of you have seen action on the front lines, but here we start again and we start as equals with one aim in mind, to make you officers in the finest army in the world. At ease. I see it was Colonel Haig-Brown that recommended you for officer training. Good man, Haig-Brown. Look, I shan't beat about the bush Tull. I know we're in desperate need of officers, but this is a step too far. Celebrated footballer or not, I am a man of military law and it says here on page 198 to be precise that officers shall be of pure European descent. Page 471, subsection two, note three that Negros and other persons of colour shall not exercise any actual command or power. This is not about prejudice Tull. It's simply logic. A Negro officer would affect the morale of the men. Permission to speak sir. Granted. I have led white men previously sir. Nonsense. You were a non-commissioned officer carrying out orders given to you by a superior. Now I can't contradict my superiors, but be warned Tull, my job is to ensure the smooth running of this camp. Anything that gets in the way of that is an enemy, not just of mine, but of the entire war effort and it will not be tolerated. Do I make myself clear? Perfectly sir. Dismissed. This really is the short straw. We're in the middle of bloody no-where. No man's land. I'm not looking forward to PT. Never my forte. What is your forte? Nothing much. Then what are you doing here? Target practise for Fritz. My country needs me. Our country must be desperate. [Fuller] Stand by your beds. Why is this bed empty? May I speak frankly, sir? Go ahead. I refuse to sleep in the same room as a Negro. Then I suggest you sleep outside. Either that or go home immediately, Hummings. Either option's fine by me. Cadet Tull, did you bring slacks and shirts to match? No sir. Do you think I should dispose of the shoes, sir? First sign of a good officer, sacrifice. Thank you. Contribution to the battalion funds. I expect you to behave like gentlemen. [lively drumming music] We're supposed to be running not strolling. We're shaking yesterday's long journey here from our legs. We're waking up the mind. We need to think. Mr. Tull, you're supposed to be an athlete. Faster! I said faster! Who's the slowcoach? Cadet Willis, sir, a bit of a pudding. How are the men with Tull? [Fuller] Too early to say sir. Anything untoward, let me know immediately. Yes, sir. Mr. Willis you're walking. This isn't a Sunday stroll. If Fritz could see you now he'd be laughing his cock off. [Willis] I'm trying sir. Stop now. Everyone stop, now. Attention! Don't ever answer me back Mr. Willis, ever! Any of you try that trick, I'll have you on a seven-day latrine duty in a flash! Do you hear me? [Company] Yes sir! Get moving. [men laughing] Two and half hours, I'm gonna be sore. [men chattering] [soft instrumental music] My friend, well, he's simply too shy to tell you that he thinks you're the most amazing vision of beauty he's ever seen. I happen to agree with him. You both are, well, both are simply the Madonnas. Hennessey, can we get a move on? I think I love you. I'm sorry about my friend. It's fine, it's rather sweet actually. Thank you. You look like you need a little extra. I'm Connie by the way. Walter. Walter Tull. Thank you. What you doing that for? Doing what? Being all, you know, with him. I'm not being anything. Yes, you were. You were all. He spoke to me, I spoke back. What am I supposed to do, ignore the man? Sorry dear boy, Oxford only. No plebeians allowed. My father is hardly what you'd call. I don't care what your father is. This table is full. God, it's cold up here. Aye. They do say however, it'll get warmer, however. Or we'll get used to it. Would you mind terribly if we'd? Fine. I understand. How many of you men have used a rifle before? How many of you have shot at a man before? As I'm sure you can attest, it is a totally different affair. The first think you have to learn is how to hold the rifle with respect, with love even, like a woman. Any of you private schoolboys held a woman before? [man laughing] Did I say something funny Mr. Hennessey? No sir. Mr. Tull, I'm told you're not stranger to showing the white man how it's done. Come on, let's not monkey about. Demonstrate for us. [dramatic instrumental music] [Crowd] Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. [crowd chattering] Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Look, the fans are calling us the Nigger Team and the board don't like it. Best if you sit this one out. [Crowd] Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. Monkey. First rank. Standing position. Gentlemen, we are all I assume men of God. So I do not take it lightly when I tell you that this is your bible. The new SS135 and SS143 training manuals. A distillation of everything we've learnt in this war to date. You will read it, understand it, devour it and when the time comes regurgitate their contents to devastating effect. Every scenario, every principle and procedure, every detail must become second nature, embedded, up here. You will be tested on every word, every symbol. Are you with us Mr. Tull? [men chattering] Getting to you already? Suppose you've had far worse than that on the football pitch? Far worse. Interesting place though this, isn't it? The brightest and the best, being trained, so that we can lead more men to their deaths. That's very optimistic of you. Am I wrong? I mean, you've been there. So if you feel like that, why are you here? My father and my grandfather were both officers as much as I hate it, I have to be. The question is, why are you here Tull? Allowing them to put the wind up you, make an ass of you. No-one's making an ass of me, all right? You've seen the scale of this massacre and yet you jump when they offer you the chance to lead more working men to their deaths? I don't question a Negro being here Tull. I question why a Negro, treated as you are in this country, would want to be here in the first place. [soft instrumental music] Thank you Connie. You remembered my name, Yes, it's one word, I'm not stupid you know. I didn't say you were. No, you didn't. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you for opening the door for me. It's all right. So is that how you ladies do it down here? Girls taking the lead? I don't quite understand what you mean. You know, opening doors, saying hello. If you mean do we have more manners than the English girls then the answer's yes. Well, I'm glad to hear it. Terribly, terribly glad to hear it. So, what do you well-mannered girls do on a Saturday night in a village like this then? If she's mindful of her reputation, she keeps herself to herself. Oh, reputation, reputation. I've lost the immortal part of myself and all that remains is bestial. Something my brother would say. Anyway, listen. How about you and me find a town far away from here, where no-one knows us and well, we can be free as birds. Are all you coloured boys this forward? I can't speak for anyone else, but me, I believe in carpe diem. What's that? It's my favourite saying. It means, seize the day. What African language is that? Very ancient, ancient African language. Latin. [laughing] So what do you say, are we stepping out? No, we are not. But maybe if we happen to run into each other at the end of the day, there's no law saying you can't walk me home. You don't just have to lead your men intellectually, you have to be superior to them in every way. The quickest way to gain their respect is to physically impress them. Go. [lively drumming music] The quickest way to lose their respect is to be weak. There's always one that can't handle it, and I think that's you, isn't it Mr. Willis? Mr. Tull! What do you think you're doing? Helping my fellow team member sir! [Fuller] You will stop that right now. Yes sir, I've stopped sir. Don't play games with me Mr. Tull. If Mr. Willis cannot complete a basic exercise he should not be here. Carry on. [gunshot banging] What are you doing here? I came out for some air, that's all. Thought maybe you were waiting to walk me home. [Connie laughing] [Walter] Have you worked here long? [Connie] Too long. When the Army opened this place a year ago my mate Joanne dragged me to help her out. I haven't found the escape route yet. So I hear you're quite the famous sportsman? No, I don't know about famous. I mean, I was a footballer, but I'm a soldier now. At least till the war ends. My dad said he saw you play once. -Oh yeah? -Said you were rubbish. He must have me mixed up with someone else. [laughing] So, have you heard of Rangers? My team? Well I can't have been that rubbish if they wanted to sign me, can I? Is that so? That is so. Do you miss it? I miss the travelling, but I'm a soldier now, war moves on, time carries on till then. You'll just become an officer and travel the world that way. Yeah. Have you been to many places? Let's see I was born in Folkestone, educated in Bethnal Green, London. Sounds posh. It was an orphanage. I have been to Argentina, Uruguay. -South America? -Uh-huh. Yeah, it was a football tournament. We only lost one match. It wasn't my fault, you can tell your father. Actually we all got very ill, so basically they cheated. -Excuses. -No they did. Been to France, helped dig a trench. And now I'm in Scotland doing the same thing. How about you? No. This is it for me. Gailes, Scotland, it's home. And this is where I leave you. What under the bridge? No, my brother waits for me just over it. Ahh. Well, thanks Connie. It's been the best conversation I've had in a long while. That's because you're talking about yourself. Oh yeah. -We should have some more. -I'd like that. Good. [chuckling] -Good night. -See you tomorrow. -Yeah. -Goodnight. We'll talk about you next time. Good. Good night. [soft piano music] It is the role of the officer to ensure that the men under his command follow the barrage at the correct pace and at the correct distance. 50 yards is about as close as we would risk. So, let's see who knows their yards from their feet. On a beautiful clear day like this, identifying the 50-yard mark may not be much of a problem. However. [firecracker buzzing] Like this. Well, it's a little more difficult, isn't it gentlemen? [firecracker buzzing] Move as quickly as you can to what you believe to be the 50-yard mark. Stick your flag in the earth and return to first position. Go. Remember you have men on either side of you. What you think is earth might be your best friend's big toe. [rhythmic drumming music] -[chattering] -[gunfire blaring] [Walter] Come on! Come on Tull. Well that was a mess, wasn't it gentlemen? Mr. Tull, I'm knocking you out because you've done it before. That makes the winner, Mr. Willis. Hold onto the celebration Mr. Willis. You're still a few feet out. That few feet could be the difference between life and death. 10, hut. You see that? I just wanted to thank you for helping me. And sorry about the other day. So gentlemen, once again I say this is all about speed. Getting the bullets into the magazine as quickly as possible. If the Lewis gunner has to wait, that could be the end of your platoon. Mr. Tull? Are you listening, Mr. Tull? Just because you have done this before does not mean you do not have to listen. Mr. Hummings. That is useless Mr. Hummings. A Girl Guide could do this exercise quicker. Mr. Tull, replace Mr Hummings. Parade yourself boy! I didn't ask Mr. Cooper, what are you looking at him for? [soft drumming music] [gunfire blaring] -[bombs exploding] -[men chattering] What's the matter with you boy? Get on with it. Maybe this is all too much for you, eh, Mr. Tull? Maybe it is, sir. Or maybe I just don't like being called boy or paraded. Don't be facetious with me Mr. Tull. Facetious, sir? I don't know what that means. Out! Out right now! Do you think this is the right way to go about this Cadet Tull? About what sir? Don't. I know what you're going through Tull. With respect sir, I don't think you do. I have been praised and promoted for serving our country and yet I have not be afforded the respect. Respect is not handed out here, it is earned. How can I earn it? Fuller speaks to me as if I'm some-- That is all part of your training Tull, your specific training. You think it'll all be fine on the field because men have followed you before? Think again. You are not their superior officer. I'm minded to recommend to Colonel Baxter that you be released from Gailes. Have you nothing to say? Then I'll give you till Monday. Dismissed, Mr. Tull. Dear father, thank you for the gift of family and of food, and everything else. Amen. Amen. That was very articulate. We can't all be pillars of the community, can we? Don't be jealous now just because I have a steady job. Steady job? You don't take money from half your patients. Only the half who can't afford to pay. It's a wonder you've got any food in your house at all. So how are you feeling? Fine. Yeah, everything's fine. So you're fitting in all right? They've given me till Monday to tell them whether or not I want to stay at Gailes, and I don't know. I've never walked out on anything in my life. I wish it was as straight forward as my colour. But it's more than that. I keep falling into sweats. Seeing things I've pushed out of my mind. Then you won't be walking out on anything. The Rangers are just waiting for you to return. I don't care about football right now Eddie. I don't care. That's all you've got to say to me? Come home? What else do you want me to say? Do you remember when Pa used to tell us stories of Grandad in the West Indies? How do you think Grandpa survived? I contend he just got on with it. I can't imagine what our grandfather went through Walter, but I do know he didn't choose to be a slave. He didn't choose his path. But you, on the other hand, Walter. Some might say it chose me. Well, I'm not one of them. [soft orchestral music] What you did was stupid Tull. You don't trade blow for blow with the establishment. You outsmart them, out think them Walter. I don't know what your point is. I've seen the way you jump when a gun's fired. The way you sweat when you remember. You may fool the others, but a man who's seen shells exploding in front of his face understands why this cannot be allowed to go on for longer. The Russian troops are in mutiny in Petrograd, there are rumours of unrest amongst the French. How long before it hits our boys? I don't think it will. It depends who's leading them. I want to be an officer because I know I can do a better job than those that led me. I'm not gonna lead our men into mutiny. If I were you I'd be very careful who I spoke to in that fashion. It's very dangerous talk. So Cadet Tull. Sir if you could allow me, I'd like to stay on. Succeed. Serve my country the best way I can. Is that your honest feeling Tull? Yes sir, it is. Then stay you shall. Thank you sir. How do you survive war, Walter? With the help of the men around you, I suppose. Your team and God. Can't dodge a bullet, the bullet has to miss you. The best way to survive war is not to think about death. Even though it's all around you? So's life, friendship. It's hard to understand unless you've been there, but you'll see. You find brothers in war. Men prepared to lay their lives down for you. Not just for king, but for you. [lively piano music] * We've watched you playing cricket * * And every kind of game * * At football, golf and polo * * You men have made your name * * But now your country calls you to play your part in war * * And no matter what befalls you * * We shall love you all the more * * So come and join the forces like your fathers did before * * Oh, we don't want to lose you * Cooper! Cooper Cooper. * Go * * For your king and your country * Tull. * Both need you so * * We shall want you and miss you * * But with all our might and main * * We shall cheer you, thank you, bless you * * When you come home again * * Oh, we don't want to lose you * Sorry. Cheeky. I can't help it. Look, would you mind terribly if I didn't walk you home tonight. It's just the boys. I know. I know, it's important you stay with the boys. I'll be fine. You sure? I was fine walking home before you got here, wasn't I? Yeah. See you again tomorrow. Do you honestly think she'll wait for me? Course she will. He's a brilliant man, isn't he Willis? A great man and brilliant man. -Do you really think so? -I do. If I was your woman Ozzy. Let's stop right there, shall we? Why? Why would you stop a man from showing his true feelings? Carry on Willis. If I were you gentlemen I'd carry onto your beds and get an early night. Mills bomb practise in the morning. Lots of bangs and whizzes. It'll feel as if you're on the front line itself. Hoo rah. Gentlemen, this may be the last time you do this exercise and there is not a life on the other end of this that will not be damaged. The Mills bomb. This is live ammunition gentleman. I reiterate this is live. If you mess it up you lose a limb. If you lose a limb, you are no good to your country or dare I say the wives you will not attract, or if by some freak chance you do, certainly not satisfy. We don't throw them. What do we do Mr. Cooper? We lob them, sir. Correct. We lob them taking care not to hit the overhead parapet and have them rebounding back into our own bloody trench. [laughing] You may laugh, but it happens and it's far from funny when it does, and so pin out and we let it go. [bomb banging] [bomb banging] [gunfire blaring] Over to you. Mr. Hummings. [dramatic drumming music] [bombs exploding] Get down! Get down! [bomb blaring] What are you doing? I was gonna clear it. Stupid nigger. Don't you ever put your hands on me. Stop that this instant. Let him go. Let him go. This man saved your stupid ass and that of your comrades. If you can't see that, you have no business here. Cadet Hummings, apologise right now. I said apologise sir! Bugger this. Bugger all of it. That was bloody stupid Mr. Tull. You should have dived for cover. If the officer dies who leads the men? Consider that test failed Cadet Tull. In order to graduate you will need to pass every other exam, sir. First line, first wave consist of two sections of six riflemen. -Eight. -Damn it. Eight. Eight riflemen, eight. Maybe you should stop Walter. Do I look like I need to stop? You don't need to talk to me like that. Sorry. It's all right. I understand, but you're really pushing yourself. Can we just do it again please? You didn't eat today Walter. Oh come on. Look, you didn't need to do that. I'm fine, I'm fine, would you, I'm fine. What were you saying about the riflemen again? Sorry. Thank you. [lively instrumental music] Building trenches, care of tools, field geometry, levelling, obstacles and machine gun emplacements. All of these subjects you will know like the back of your hand or you will fail. There's no shame in failing, only in not doing your best. Proceed. You're quiet. You're suddenly full of beans. Take it you think you've passed? Whatever happens, happens. I've done my best, what else can I do? I'm never gonna see you again, am I? After this, after you've been sent away? I mean even if you wanted to. Who's to say you'll even survive? Thanks for the vote of confidence. Officers are the first ones over. The first ones they'll see, the first ones they'll shoot at. It's not in your hands. The bullet has to miss you, remember? Connie. I'm gonna come back. I'm gonna come back. I'd better. Yeah your brother will be waiting. I don't have a brother. I know. It's stupid, and I'm gonna regret saying this the instant it comes out of my mouth, but don't forget me. And if you find that you miss me, come back. Come back to me Walter. How long would you be willing to wait? Try me. [Fuller] Mr. Hennessey. Yes. Mr. Cooper. Mr. Willis. Thank you. Well done gentlemen. Oh I forgot. Mr. Tull. [soft instrumental music] 2nd Lieutenant Walter Daniel John Tull. Well done Officer Tull. Thank you sir. * Private Perks was a funny little codger * * With a smile, a funny smile * * Five feet none, he's an artful little dodger * The world's going to change. You know that, don't you?

[Walter] Back to the front I suppose. I've been meaning to-- Pa gave me this just before he died. It was given to him by Grandpa. He would have wanted you to have it now. I know that. So that wherever you are, you remember. Look how far we've come. Thanks Eddie. Now just don't die on me brother. [laughing] [soft instrumental music] [bombs exploding] All right lads, they're almost through on the left flank. They're about to break through the right. We hold them until our last round of ammunition, not the last man. Let's show them what we're made of! -[men chattering] -[gunfire blaring] Go go go! Go go go. Keep running. Go. [gunfire blaring] Come on, let's go. Get up or you die! Get up! Get moving! -[gunfire blaring] -[men chattering] [soft instrumental music] [knocking] [Soldier] Allow me to say how popular 2nd Lieutenant Walter Tull was throughout the battalion. He was brave and conscientious. He'd been recommended for the military cross and had certainly earned it. The commanding officer had every confidence in him and he was liked by his men. Now he has made the supreme sacrifice Pro Patria The battalion and company have lost a faithful officer.
