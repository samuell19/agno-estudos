Okay, but not for the boys. Okay. Whoa, these are pretty. How 'bout this one'? I like this one. Oh, this one! This one's really pretty! Ya know What? I don't think this one's the right size. Tell ya What- ummmm-- Why don't you go try that one on. I'm going to go over there and see if I can find you some lacy socks to match, okay'? Okay. See ya later, alligator! After a While, crocodile! Jennifer? Jennifer, which one are you in'? Jennifer, come on, quit playing games. We're in here. Excuse me...I'm sorry. Excuse me...I'm sorry. Jennifer? Jennifer? Jennifer? Jennifer? Jennifer? Ma'am, can I help you? Is something wrong? Yes, my daughter is missing. I told her to try on this dress and... and I found the dress on the oor and... What's her name? Jennifer. Jennifer? Richards. She Wouldn't have left me. She'd... This is not like her. This is not like her. [PA system announcement] Jennifer Richards to the children's department please. Jennifer Richards to the children's department. [crying] She Wouldn't have done that. I mean something's really Wrong, she left her dress in the middle of the floor there. At least she comes and tells me when she's going somewhere. Something is really Wrong. (Weber) We just got it on the air. Obviously the little girl is still missing. (Police Officer) Yeah, the mother left the girl to change and when she came back her daughter was missing. We've done an extensive search of the store and she's not there unless she's hiding. (Temple) Gary, I just checked the girls' room, she's not in there. What do you think, she's hiding in the house here somewhere? We just need to be sure she's not. My daughter could be out there in trouble, and you guys are Wasting time in the house!'? You need to get out there and do your job and find her! Mr. Richards... This is a waste of time! Mr. Richards, you said you had another daughter. Where is she? See ya. No, chief, nobody saw her leave. No, chief, nobody saw her leave. No, she's not at the mall. We've been through the whole mall. No, We're at the house now. Well, I think it's a little early for a statewide ATL. Send two cars down to help patrol the area. I'll get the word out to all the other officers on both shifts and contact the local media. After that, all We can do is wait. A little girl has been missing for several hours, and police are now asking for your help. Jennifer Richards was shopping with her mother in a local department store when she disappeared. She is 7 years old,4'2", Weighs about 65 pounds and has long brown hair... We're gonna find her. [soft music playing] Has anything, that you know, occurred at home? Like a fight with her sister, or maybe some trouble at school. I'm sorry, Mrs. Richards we think it's possible your daughter ran away. This is ridiculous. You don't know her. You don't know us! I'm not trying to pass judgment on you and your family, Mrs. Richards, but, given the circumstances it's the most plausible explanation. Get out! Now Wait a minute... Both of you get out! I'm going to call the police chief and get someone on this case who can find my daughter! You are Wasting Mme! Wasting time! Look, there's a reason Why We're thinking this. Don't you Wanna know? (Weber) Come on, Temple, let's go. Wait! Wait. Anything you know I Want to hear? I'M come right to the point. We've got a Witness. We talked to a clerk in the store who saw a little girl walk into the woods behind the mall. Are you absolutely sure it was her? No, but the time frame fits, and, frankly, he's the only Witness we've got. Look, if somebody took your daughter out of the store, against her Will, nobody saw anything unusual. No yelling, no screaming. Just her dress on the floor like she dropped it and ran off. I can see why you might think that, but, believe me, I'm her mother, she would not have run away. She was excited to be there. She was picking out a dress. I mean, she was happy. I'm gonna keep every possibility open. Every cop on the street's got his eye out for her. And We'll search everywhere, including the Woods. (Searchers) Jennifer! Jennifer! (Dad) Thanks, mom, I just feel like Gods really with us right now. I've never really felt that Way before. I know. You Know what I think We should do right now. I think We should pray. I don't know if I can pray. Why not? I love her morn I really do. I prayed that I'd get more of the attention, but I didn't want this to happen. Oh, honey, this didn't happen because of you. It's not your fault. Cara, put your hand, right over your heart, and I want you to feel deep down inside. I just Know she's going to be back. And she's going to be up here and she's going to be singing and laughing, and telling stones. We're going to be one big happy family. I promise you. But Mom... I promise you. I miss her. I miss her, too. Well? I talked to search and rescue. They're going to send the dogs up over that ridge about a mile back. Are We gonna go join them then'? The Guards going to be here soon. Let's Wait for them. Hey, did you see the paper this morning? I got quoted. If We don't find her soon, We'll have to assume the Worst"? I'm sure that made everybody feel better. Well, What should I have said'? Don't Worry folks, We'll find her"? You could have said something hopeful, at least. Like What? I don't know. I wish we had something The kid just vanished. Vanished into thin air. Now there's your quote We've been out here for days searching these woods, and We haven't found a thing. Ya Know that was a false lead. It's the only lead We've got. Besides, if We don: cover this ground with the dogs-.. That's the easy Way out. Ya know, nobody Wants to face up to the truth. And that is that a little girl was abducted from Rapid City, South Dakota. Now if we don't start facing those facts and start looking in that direction, then We're just Wasting our time. But if you want to keep looking out here, I guess that's What We're going to do. If this was a stranger abduction she was dead the night she disappeared. Come on, Man, you Know the statistics. That's why I keep hoping she ran away At least that Way she has a chance. I refuse to give up. I've seen some incredible things on this job. And We can always Keep praying for a miracle. (Pastor) Dear Lord, please give us the strength to make it through every day, and the faith to Know that you're with us, and with our Jennifer. Through all the pain and the doubts. In Jesus name We pray, Amen. (AH) Amen. We Know she's going to be back. Our faith is strong. (Women) Hi Shana. Hi. We just stopped by to let you know that We're thinking about you and We wanted to bring you a few things to share- just to let you Know that you're in our thoughts and in our prayers, and if there's anything at all that we can do, please don: hesitate to call. Thanks. I appreciate that. Why don: you all come on in'? Hey Billy. Ya got a minute? Oh, hey buddy. I was Wondering if you don't mind if you could hang some of these fliers up for me at the plant. Well sure, absolutely. I really appreciate your help. Would you like to come in and sit down for a little bit'? Well, I better not. I've got to get going. Hey, thanks again. Glad to do it. Shana! Hi. Gosh, I didn't know you'd be out. I picked up some groceries for you. But since you're here Why don't you just open up your trunk, and We'll put them right in. Look, that's really sweet of you, but you can't afford this. Sharia, I'm your friend. I'm not going to have you spending your entire check on my family. Now, how much do I owe you? Bren, I'm sorry it's just... It's alright. I Know what it's like to lose someone you love. She's not dead, Bren. MUST Want you to know that if you need someone to talk to, I'm here. Okay, thank you. Good bye. I don't suppose they have any new leads yet? No. Nothing. At least they're still looking. Too bad you Weren't. What? Looking! Watching her! Watching Jennifer? Would it have been too much to walk with her to the dressing room'? What were you thinking letting her go off by herself like that'?! I'm sorry. Oh please, dear God, please bring her back I can: live Without her. Don: make her pay for my mistake. Oh God, please God, please. Do you want me to go in with you'? Sure. Okay kids, in our fifth rule in stranger danger, to help you keep from being abducted is to learn to say "no," loud and dear. When We say "no" to a stranger, We don't just say no, (Whisper) We need to say NO! (shout) Okay, We're going to practice that. Okay, on three I Want you to give me your best "no," your loudest "no. " Okay? One, two, three. (Kids shout) NO! Very good. I bet everybody on the block could hear you. That's the Way you Want to say "no" when you say "no" to a stranger. Okay? Thanks. Tough habit to break, huh'? I sure picked the worst time to try. I haven't touched one of these in three months. Right now, one of them would taste so good. I didnt come out here to bug ya. Actually, I Wanted to bring you the list you Wanted. Pedophiles and sex offenders. My favorite kind of criminals. Start from the top. Simple interviews. If somebody squirms, We dig deeper. That's What we're going to go off of'? If somebody squirms? How are you supposed to know if the guy is telling the truth or hot'? What if he's a good actor'? Couldn't he act his Way through a lie detector test'? That's pretty scary. No, the scariest criminal is one who doesn't need to act and doesn't think he's guilty. [phone ringing] Detective Weber. Okay, thank you, good bye. Who was that? Who was that? She said the cheekbones need to be a little higher. We can fix that. Miss Sampson, would you have Mrs. Sampson tell us What she saw? (Translating) Okay, I Went to the mall and I was looking at some material for my craft mass. And I was for looking at all the different sales and I was trying to save some money. They don't Want to hear all that, get to the point. I know. Okay. (Continue translating) I went into a store, and I was looking at some sweaters and I saw a little girl leading a blind man to the door. I Wish I could have known that man was going to take the little girl. There's no Way you could have Known. L-low's it going, Jim'? Well, let's see. That's him, that's him! (Translating) That's a good picture of the man that took the little girt. Very scary. Do you recognize the face'? We have a woman who believes she saw this man with your daughter on the day she disappeared. We also believe he is pretending to be blind. Do you recognize him? No, I-I've never seen this man before. [dreaming] See ya later, alligator. After awhile, crocodile. Need some help'? Jennifer? (gasping) So, how long We gonna hang around here, anyway? Huh, maybe stay the rest of the day. It's a good place to people Watch. We might even come back tomorrow. Why? Don't you just think We're Wasting our time? I mean, What are the odds he's going to try the same stunt again? I don't know, but I'm not going to be the one to give him another chance. I don't understand how a human being can be so sick. Satan rules, partner. This guy's just business as usual for that old boy. Sorry, I don: believe in the devil. Oh, you don't believe the dew Walks the streets, huh? Especially not in a little town like Rapid'? Tell ya what, I'll give you a few more years on this job. The next time you scrape some poor, drunk, dead teenager out of the inside of a car, or Watch some guy blow his Wife away? Well, son, you just tripped over him. Well, son, you just tripped over him. Personally, I just think people control their own lives. I don't see a guy with horns and a tail controlling people's lives. Ya know What I mean? Temple... I couldn't find him Is he outside'? Nowhere. There! Stop, police! Take him, Temple! (Blind Man) Emily! Emily! (Emily) Daddy! This is pathetic! Mr. Blake, you have to understand, this has been frustrating for us as well. We have a Witness who gives us a composite drawing that looks like you exactly. You guys have me confused with somebody else. Possibly... but that's why I want to talk to you for a little while. That is alright isn't it'? Yeah, sure. He checks out. Turns out he's been blind since childhood. That's his little daughter, Emily. He has a Wife, Cynthia. She's pretty mad. She's coming over right now. Ya know, I think we're missing something here. I think we have got the guy in the composite drawing. How so? Mr. Blake, do you ever come shopping by yourself? No. I always go with my wife or a friend, or sometimes my daughter and I take the bus. Was there a time when you got separated, recently, and needed help getting out of the store'? Specifically Allen's Clothing Store on the afternoon of Friday, August 8th'? I can't remember the date or the store, but, yeah. Yeah, I got turned around a couple of Weeks ago. I was with my daughter, Emily. She left me for some reason and, I thought I could find my Way to the front door, but I just got turned around. But finally, I found my Way out and that was it. How did you get back'? Did someone help you'? Yeah,yeah a little girl. She helped me find the exit. That's all I know. Can I go now? Listen, I Want to thank you and your daughter both for your cooperation this afternoon. And I apologize for the misunderstandings. Come on, honey, let's go. Let's go meet mom. Wait a minute. I just remembered something. When We got to the door. She said hello to somebody. Somebody she recognized. She said "Hi"... [thinking] I can't remember-- sorry. [dramatic music] [whistle blows] [dramatic music] [thinking] Well, look who's here. (baby crying) (Pastor) I baptize you in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen. May God bless and protect this baby. May God bless and protect this baby. (crying) God, I had to bury my beautiful baby today. That is the hardest thing I have ever had to do. And I don't understand. I prayed to you. I believed in you. I believed you'd protect her. (shouting) Don't you have anything to say to me now? [dramatic music] Ready to go? Yeah, let's go. This place gives me the creeps. I can: close this case. Not yet. What are you looking for? Answers, resolution, a reason Why a 7 year-old girl was found dead in the middle of the Woods. I didn't think that was still a question. She fell 13' from that ledge and broke her neck. Yes. She was running. Why? She was scared. It was getting dark. We don't know the reasons Why she was out here, but it Wasn't because she was abducted. No one was chasing her. How do you know? The autopsy report. There were no signs of abuse. And Why are you changing your mind anyway? From the very beginning of this case, The blind man she helped in the mall, the person she recognized outside... There's more places to this than We've put together. We close this case now, we could be letting a murderer go free. Gary... What about her necklace? A Mme gold cross. It Wasn't on her body, and it hasn't been found anywhere since. Look, Gary, just hold it. There's no conflict here. There's two miles from the mall to here. It could have fallen off anywhere. The person she met outside of the mall, the one she recognized, it could have been a friend. Someone who egged her on to run away. We don't Know all the details, but We know enough. Don't drag this out. If you start chasing phantoms it's going to hurt everyone. Let it go. [dramatic music] Hi. It's been awhile. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry about What happened. I guess God just needed a little girl in heaven. So Where's your wife is she corn-- She didnt come today. [dramatic music] How do you do it, Bren? How do you get through each day? Oh, it's not always easy. I pray a lot. Sometimes when I'm really missing them, I hold their picture to my heart and I pretend that We're still together, we're still a family, and you Know What? We still are. I will never forget them. You don't have to forget about them to get over the pain. There's some pain that will never go away. That's just the Way it is. Sometimes I hurt so bad, I think my heart's just going to break right in two, and that's when I ask God for comfort, and He's there for me. He puts his arms around me, and He comforts me. I'm not too happy with God right now. To tell you the truth, my faith is shattered. I'm not even sure He exists. I was angry with God for a long time. I couldn't understand how He could- how He could let the accident happen. Why didnt He give my husband the strength to steer away. Why didnt He protect my son when that car sideswiped them? I was angry with myself, too. See, they had gone out for pizza that night, and I Wanted some stamps. So I asked them to swing by the supermarket and to pick them up for me. It Wasn't urgent, I didnt need those stupid stamps. Oh, Bren. Ya Know that drunk driver'? He was killed in the accident, too. I was so angry with him. Death was too good for him. I envisioned his soul burning in hell. That's Where he belongs. No, I felt that Way, too, for almost two years after the accident, Something I'll never forget. I was sitting in the park one day just listening to the wind blow through the trees. I realized someone was sitting down next to me. It's a beautiful day, isn't it. The sun feels good on my face. You're happy, then? I'm okay. Something Wrong? A few years back, a young man was killed in a czar wreck. He'd been drinking. His czar hit another, and two people were killed a father and a son. That young man was my son. I'm Charles's mother. My name is Anne. I don't--maybe I-- maybe I raised him Wrong, and I wasn't enough of a mother for him, but ever since that day, I've carried this pain that somehow I was responsible for those deaths. It saddens me to Know how much hurt you feel, how much you've been through. But please, he was a good kid, and I loved him very much. It's been a weight on my heart for so very long. I need for you to know how sorry I am for everything that's happened to you. Can you please forgive me for not being the greatest mom, but more important can you please forgive my son. If he was here right now he would Want to Know that he was forgiven. (Bren off screen) Something inside me lifted that day. Anger Id been carrying around with me for two years started to disappear. And I forgave that Woman, and I forgave her son. That's when the healing really began. Forgiving him allowed me to rebuild my faith in God, and lime by little I started to pick up the pieces. Hi, sweetheart. I don't think Springs ever going to come. I miss you. We all miss you so much. I can't make myself understand What happened. It makes no sense to me Why you're gone. You should be here. I Want to check on you at night, and make sure you're sleeping safely in your bed. I Want to tuck you in. I Want to read you stones. We should be building a snowman today. I'm just probably being selfish. I can: even begin to imagine what you went through. How scared you must have been. I'm sorry. Mommy's so sorry. Oh God, how am I supposed to deal with all this hurt'? [dramatic music] Gary, there you are. You wanted to see me what's going on'? I'm thinking about closing the Richards case. Well good. Is there a reason We kept it open this long'? I don't know. Nothing specific. My gut's just bothering me. Take something for it. It's time to get over this. I just find it hard to believe that Jennifer wandered off on a whim. I'd like to find that kid she talked to. The whole thing doesn't seem right. How could it seem right, Gary'? She's gone, it's over. Look, nobody wanted to see it end this Way, nobody, but there comes a point Where you gotta let it go. Alright, alright. I just want to tell the family in person. You don't have to come. No, We started this together, let's end it together. I'M meet you over at the house... What? Fifteen minutes? Hey Honey. You don't feel too hot. How's your tummy? Not so good. Do we have any tummy medicine? No, I think We're out. Do you Want me to get you some? And some soda? Soda sounds good? Okay. I'm going to have to call somebody to go get you some. Alright? So I'll be right downstairs. You just stay here and rest. [busy signal] [phone rings] Hello. Hi Bill, this is Sharia. Oh hi, Sharia. Say, how are you doing? I'm fine. Cara's not feeling very Well today, though, and I was Wondering if you could go to the store and pick up a few things for her. Jims out of town, and MUST don't Want to leave her alone. [Bill hesitates] BM? No, no, I understand, but I'm sorry, I need to stay here and keep an eye on my mother. Well, that's fine then, I can call someone else. How about if I come over and Watch her While you go to the store. You're just right across the street. That Way I can keep an eye on my mother, too. If you've gotta stay and Watch your mom, I mean, that's fine. I understand. No, it's no problem. I'll see ya in 30 seconds. Good bye. Honey, Billy's going to come over and watch you while I go get your stuff, okay'? He is? Yeah. Alright. Okay. (knock on the door) Hi Bill. Hi Sharia. Thanks for coming over I really appreciate it. You bet. It's no problem. Cara's upstairs in her room. It shouldn't take me but a few minutes to go get that stuff. No sweat, take your time. Okay, thanks. Cara, Bill's here, so I'm gonna go get your stuff now. I'll be back in a few minutes. Thanks. You bet. (Whispers) No, not this time. (Cara) Billy'? Will you please bring me a glass of water? Yeah sure, just a minute. (Whispers) Not in the house. Hey there. Hey Billy. Here's your Water. Thanks. Say, Cara, how would you like to go for some ice cream? It always makes me feel better when I'm sick. And I Know the fresh air will do you some good. Morn might not like that though. Actually it was her idea. Well, we thought of it together as she was leaving. But, I'm sure it will be okay. Really? Sure. Why don't you throw some clothes on and We'll leave. Okay'? Okay. Are you just about ready, sweetie? Almost, I still gotta tie my shoes. Well hurry up. We don't Want to take too long. Excuse me. Cara, are your parents at home? Mom Went to the store. She'll be back in a little bit. Where are you guys off to? Billy's taking me out for ice cream to help me feel better. That's right. Come on Cara, let's go. Wait a minute. I have a message for the family. Could I leave it with you? Yeah, sure, go ahead. Well, let's go in the house. Actually, We're kind of in a hurry, so either give me the message now or Wait 'til Sharia gets home. Sir, I think we could talk more easily in the house. I don't understand What you're talkin' about. There's nothing to discuss, right'? You either have a message or you don:. Sir...Sir! We gotta go. We gotta go. Quick, Cara, get out of the car! Dispatch, 42. Suspect fled in a late model red Bronco, hostage on board. West on Skyline Drive. Will advise. 24 to dispatch. I am in the area. Request code. What are you doing'? That guy was kind of annoying, don: you think'? I couldn't stand to look at him any longer. You up for a little trip'? It's alright. You're safe with me. Cara? Okay, if I head West on Flormann I might be able to cut this guy off. 24, go for it. I'll try to keep him in visual range. Temple, you've got a kid in that czar. Try not to Kill anybody along the way. This is car 6, ETA two minutes. (Dispatch) Copy, two minutes Turn around, please. I Want to go home. Man, can you believe that guy? He just had to get on my back. I mean, all I was trying to do was take you out for some ice cream. Have some fun, just you and me. Please, you're scaring me. You scare pretty easy then, don't ya. What's this idiot's problem? Driver, pullover the car. Alright, pal. Pull over now! 24, What do you think you're doing'? Now, back it off. We're going to drop the spikes on him anyhow. Copy'? Pull over the car! 24, COPY- I'll set up the spikes. You guys set up the funnel. [Whistles] Temple! Temple! Down. Down. Spikes are set Spikes are set. [Dramatic music with slow motion action] Driver, step out of the vehicle! Driver, shut off the vehicle and step out! Step out of the vehicle now! Driver, step out of the vehicle now! Billy? Billy'? Is everyone meeting us here? Shhhhhh. I Know your birthday was yesterday, but, this is an extra special surprise, and we Wouldn't Want to spoil it, would We? I just hope your mom told me to meet her in the right place because, well, I don't see anybody here. Oh, there We go. Okay. What? I think it's time We blindfolded you, young lady. Okay, you wait here alright? [sound of tape peeling] Billy, what was that'? Wait! Jennifer--wait! Jennifer! [dramatic music] Step back! Stay back! Go on, go to your mother. Go! Lay down on the ground! Mom, it was Billy. What? Put your left hand behind your back! Ma'am, stay back! Stay back! Stay--no, no! Get him out of here! Get him out of here! How could he do that? I already submitted my report. The Department's not gonna give you more than a slap on the Wrist. Not that you don't deserve more. I'm real disappointed in the guy I asked for a partner. So how long they gonna keep ya in here for'? I don't know. I bruised my spine, so it could be a couple days. Looks like you bruised your ego, too. Where'd We go Wrong? What? It's just stupid. The guy tried the same thing twice with the family. I mean, how come We didnt see it coming? It was a real tough case Lots of emotion. Some false leads real complicated. We didn't catch it because sometimes these things don't make any sense. If you try to get inside Billy's head, to figure out What he was thinking, and Why he did what he did you'd get lost. Both times he acted on impulse. He didnt follow Jennifer out to the mall. It was just blind chance that he saw her there. He saw the opportunity and he took it, no thought to the consequences. Then he hid behind that friendly face. And not just from those around him but from himself, too. Just don: tell me the Devil made him do it. Influenced or not, Billy made a choice. Deep down inside himself, he Knew what he was doing and he'll be judged for that. Folks, if you could just back up a minute. The Richards family has asked me to request that the press not ask them any questions this afternoon. They do not intend to make a statement at this time. On behalf of the State's Attorney's Office, though We're pleased with the plea bargain Mr. Anderson has made. He's going to be sentenced in about a month. We are going to seek the maximum sentence available. Now if you have any additional questions I'll try to take them at this time. Mrs. Richards, do you feel more at peace now that your daughter's killer has been convicted? (State' Attorney) Folks, I asked for no questions for the family. Now, if you have any more I'll try to handle them for you, okay'? (Reporter) Do you feel justice is served? (State' Attorney) Yeah, I think We got a fair plea bargain. I think there's a strong likelihood for a real severe sentence in the case, and We obviously saved the family from having to go through a long, traumatic trial. What am I doing here.

Well, I'm out of here too. Hold it. Wait a minute. Do you have your homework? Do you have your recess pass? Do you have your lunch ticket? Do you have all your pencils? I love you. I love you, too. Good bye. See you later. [Thinking of Jennifer's voice] Those are Gods hands reaching down from heaven to give us all a great big hug.

Help me to rest in the comfort of your loving arms. Subtitles by Subtitle Services (866) 230-1009
