We've got to nip it in the bud! - As Minister of Finance, I feel the solution should be to change to another colour. Change the notes from blue to red or something. - No, no, no, it just won't do. How long do you think it would take the organisation to copy a new issue? Last month, there were over a million in circulation. No, no, no, the only solution is to locate and apprehend the forgers. Well, what suggestions have any of you got to make? It's calamity! If something isn't accomplished soon, heads will roll. - I believe that this is the work of an international gang. Probably working from the continent. Sponsored by you know whom. - I disagree. Take a look at this map. Over the past four months it appears that the forgeries have been centralised in limited areas of the country. Cumberland, Yorkshire and three weeks ago, Norfolk. I would say that the organisation is operating right here in Britain, probably a giant network with various headquarters throughout the country. - I go along with that. And gentlemen, you realise that each operation appears to edge its way further down the country. I will guarantee that the next outbreak will be on the south coast, possibly somewhere in Sussex. Gentlemen, I see no point in wasting your valuable time. I suggest you return to your duties. Er, Podsnap, I'd be obliged if you could stay behind for a few more moments. - Certainly Minister. - Points I want to pick up. (men chattering) - Don't worry Minister, my country will back you up. - And Miss Dingle, perhaps you should remain as well. You do realise that the bulk of the responsibility lies with your department, don't you? - I do assure you Minister, we really are doing all we can. I'm sure that we'll come up with something before long. No doubt about it. I've got some of my best undercover men full out. - Some of them isn't enough. You have to get the whole branch out on this. What about your key man, what do you call him, 008 or something? - Regretfully, we lost him last month. - Oh. - He's dead. - Oh dear. How did it happen? - He caught the flu. - Oh, well nothing serious then. Well, who else have you got and what about your outside contacts? - I have one of my uh, contacts lined up. I expect to meet with him within the next few days. I am waiting for confirmation. You have nothing more to worry about. - Well please get on with it man! The situation is more serious than you can imagine. I expect a report from you during the next two days. - I understand perfectly, you may rely on me. - I intend to. I shan't require you any further, Podsnap. - Right, thank you, good morning Minister. (car door clicks) (steps clattering) (lock rattles) - I'm telling you Slash, they're both blowing the gaff. Yeah, there's not a bloody stick left anywhere! They've even go a bleedin' lock on the door! Yeah, everything, the machines, the plates, the optics. You what? All right yeah, I'll come straight back to the club. (groovy music) (door knocks) - You're next miss! - Coming! (playful piano music) - [Man] Go on, come on give us a dance, I love your tempo. Keep it going, keep it going. Come on love, now look at the audience. You're working, you're working to us. Remember, you got the house full. Keep it going, lovely. That's it, now keep it. That's it, keep it going, smile, now come on. There's it. That's the way I want it, come on, give it a bit more swing. Go on, come on. - Close, brilliant close. When I found her, she was knocking out burgers and chips at Oxford street, now look at it. She's a bleedin' star. - Well, you know how to pick 'em, don't you Slash? I mean, I mean are a proper little Lou Grey, aren't you? - Well, there's nothing to it mate. I've got the theatrical eye. Many haven't, but if you got it, you're made. Now, you listen to me son and you learn. (woman chattering) Come on, get your bleedin' asses off of the wood you're on! - Slash, I got here as soon as I could. - Okay, hang about mate. Can't you see there's a marquis working! - [Man] Come on, keep it going, keep it going. Where's that other bloody girl, Rose? She was supposed to be on-- - Come on, what the bleedin' hell've you got to tell me? - Right, I told on the line, they've scarpered. Lock, stock and bleedin' barrel! - Well, they've got to be found. We can't let them two bleedin' gits running around willy nilly. I mean, if someone else gets their hands on them plates mate we're in dead trouble, we're out of business! - Supposing the old Bill gets starings on 'em. - Oh come on, don't start being barmy, Norman! The law wouldn't look twice at 'em! Now, what we've got to do is get them there to sort out all the crooked fences in London. I mean, they've got to be on a manor somewhere. They haven't got one nut to take 'em further afield. If they start moonlighting again, it's gonna fall into hands right here, where we can put 'em bang to rights! (engine rumbling) - Here, let me have a look at that. - We should never have done a bunk like that, never. No, oh yes, no. They'll catch up with us, sure as my name's Maury Kelly. They will, they'll be on our tail before we can look 'round. - Utter bloody ridiculous. How do you think they're gonna find us in this wilderness? Now look Maury, the plates are mine. I engraved them and you've printed them. They're ours by right. - And will you tell them that when they catch up with us? - Yes. But they won't. Look, by the information on this document, we can't be very far from there. I would say at the next crossroads, that will lead us to Bovington. - Yeah well, could we stop at the next pub, I'm starving. - My dear old friend, fortitude. Once there, nourishment awaits. (engine rumbles) (upbeat groovy music) - Psst, psst, psst! - May I offer you a tea or some beverage, sir? - I'd better have a cup of tea, it'll look less conspicuous if I appear to be taking some refreshment. - One tea and a cup of Oxo please. - Oh, get your ass mobile and come and get it. I didn't bring me skates today. - And there's no need for rudeness. Now, I'll have one tea and a cup of Oxo please. I'll have one of these buns with-- Would you like a bun with icing? No, just the one bun with the icing, please. - 17p. - Yes, thank you. I love these buns that they sell and you can't get them everywhere, you know. - Can we get down to the business in hand? - Oh yes, yes, yes indeed, Mr. Podsnap, yes and what can I do for you? - For God sake, don't call me Podsnap! You never know who's within earshot. Call me Q. - Q oh yes, yes, I'm sorry, I do apologise. I remember that, Mr. Q, yes. Now what could I do for you, Mr. Q? - What do you think of that? - Oh, yes well, it's very nice, very. I had one myself once, you see. Beautiful texture. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, but what do you see? - Well, it's 20 quid, isn't it Mr. Q? - Right man, but what do you see about it? - Well, been in some very funny pocket. - It's a forgery! - Forgery? - Well, well, well now, that is beautiful. I seen some once as in my time, but that is a gem and no mistake. - Right, well this is very much on the QT. But the whole country's flooded with them. My department has given me the assignment to ferret out the source. - I'm very good at it you'll be, I'm sure Mr. Q. - I've got the entire bunch working on it but I need your assistance from the other side. - Oh, I see. - I would assume your contacts could be of great assistance here. The establishments you inhabit must be a breeding ground of distribution of a large percentage of these illicit notes. I need your help in this area. - Yes, yes, I see what you mean. - Well? - But now, I believe I can be of assistance to you. See, now I work with an associate in on the inside, as it were. Now, I'll make my contact with her and with her, you can meet me tonight. - Whatever you say. - Yes, the Burlesque, 11:30. - I'll be there. - Good. - And I don't need to tell you that the whole thing is very entre nous. - That's nasty, yes. Righto Mr. Podnos. - No, no, you'll remain until after I've left. We mustn't be seen leaving together. I'll see you this evening. - Another tea, 20 franks and another one of those lovely iced buns. - How do you expect me to change that? Do you think this is the bank of bleedin' England? (engine rumbling) - Thank you. (door clicks) (knocking) - Shop! (coughing) Yeah, going to your chest, see. - Hello? - Ah, reception. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - My name is Clapworthy, Cornelius Clapworthy. My colleague, Dr. Morris Kelly of Paris Conservatory. - Oh Mr. Clapworthy! I'm delighted to see you. I'm Lady Bovington, the principal at Bovington Manor. We were getting a bit archi totto about you, you know. According to your letter, you were due to arrive yesterday. - Yes, I'm afraid our journey was somewhat delayed. However, our convince managed the hazardous conditions of some of your roads here and well, here we are. (laughs) - Ah well, I hope you'll find the journey's end was worth the journey. I'm sure you'll both find peace and tranquillity here and that our treatment will restore your health completely. - That, dear lady, is our devout desire. We have some luggage outside. If you have someone, assistance would be much appreciated. - Oh yes, by all means! (bell dings) I'll ring for Mr. McKiver. Mr. McKiver is my chef de garre. - Hey, what about the nosh, I'm starving! - Restraint Maury, restraint. - Now then gentlemen, this is my Mr. McKiver, a treasure beyond measure, if I may say so. - Oh dear. Mr. McKiver, would you give Mr. Kelly a hand there? I'll handle the personal effects in the car. (clattering) (man grunting) - Good gravy! You have come kitted out for all eventualities! Anymore hand luggage? - You will look out there yonder, my lady, there's another out there as big as that! I don't know how you're gonna get up to the master bedroom. - Oh go on, Mr. McKiver, don't give us that. We are convinced that you can overcome. - It's not right. Sweat and labour-- (laughs) - See, you're thinking it's a lot of gear. - Yes. - Now, musicians, you see. What can you do with them? - What? - Have you ever heard my friend play? - No. - Oh, fat! - Good old band? - Oh good, good! In this case is his organ. It's the original one, the original one that Chopin knocked out some of his best preludes on. Oh yes! I'll give him a top line, no more, and he's away like the clappers! (laughs) Mind you, we have to practise a lot. Oh yes, so if by any chance you should happen to hear, do me a favour, take no listen. - Don't worry, Mr. Kelly! I'm tickled pink to think you should have chosen dear old Bovington as a venue for the arts. - You haven't got any other musicians here, have you? - No, regrettably, not lately. My dear brother, the late Septimus Bovington, he was a tre-- - He's dead? - Defunct. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. - He was a tremendous supporter to the arts. Oh, during his lifetime, the whole house was crammed to the attics with music and merriment! He left us all too soon, alas. Only two legacies. - Oh really. - The house and Lord Rodney. - Lord Rodney? - My nephew, bless him. My later brother's boy. He's carrying on, thank goodness, where his father left off. At the moment, he's in France with his ballet. Of course, I was forgetting! You reside in Paris with your friend, don't you? Oh how exciting! Rodney has probably played under your able batons. ♪ Pretty girl ♪ ♪ Oh la la ♪ ♪ Oh la pretty girl ♪ ♪ P is for the potent lips that make me want to kiss you ♪ ♪ R is for the rainbow that is dancing in your eyes ♪ ♪ E is for the ever present smile that lights your face up ♪ ♪ T is for the tenderness and love that never dies ♪ ♪ Pretty girl come with me ♪ ♪ And I'll buy you all the nice things you adore ♪ ♪ Pretty girl stay with me ♪ ♪ And you'll never have to worry anymore ♪ (laughing) - Hey, hey, what'd you do, what?

Is it, you've taken this side of the bed? - I have, I have. - What are all these documents? - Highly educational, very good articles in here. - May I see them? - Yes, by all means. - Thank you, thank you. Oh my goodness, these are most interesting. Oh Maury, this is the one I'm after. Good! (chanting) - Oh no pictures, no pictures. (laughs) Yes, I must say, this I could learn to live with. - [Cornelius] I am glad you like it. - You know for once, Clapworthy you've come up with the real McCoy. We don't have to dress for dinner, do we? - I think we should. Remember, we're in a very different league now. - I think we're a little off course. Maybe we should've taken that last cut off at the intersection on the motorway we were on. Hang on, hold it, Jesus, I'm doing the best I can! I'm sure almost on top. - You've been saying that now for the last three hours. - Darling, I think this is just too bloody much! We've been creeping up and down bloody lanes all day. If I see one more bloody babbling brook I'll throw up, I promise you I will. - I'm hungry. (women grumbling) - You all had fish and chips when we landed at Dover. - Big deal. - That was yesterday! - It was not yesterday, it was last night. Look, the sooner you get off my back, let me get a move on, the sooner we get there, right? - As soon as we get there, we can all sort ourselves out. (engine rumbling) (box clattering) - For God's sake, be careful with that stuff. You'll ruin the bloody plates up! - Why, what's in it? - It's my own special formula. I use it for edging the plates. (gasps) - There it is! Told you so, Bovington Manor, ancestral home for the past 500 years. (soft organ music) - Oh, listen Mr. McKiver, oh the memories! (horn honks) Now, whoever on earth can that be? - I'd better get outside and have a look. (women chattering) - Auntie love, I'm home! - Rodney, what utter bliss to see you! I thought you were still in Paris, you naughty boy. - Ah yes, but I'll tell you about that as soon as we get unpacked. - Yes darling, and you must ask all your little friends to stop to tea. - Absolutely. Oh, don't worry about the girls, Auntie, they love to mix and mingle with the guests, that sort of thing, you know. - But there are no guests, dear. That's just the point. At least except two gentlemen who arrived this afternoon. - No guests, but I thought you turned the place into a health farm! - No guests, positively not. And consequently, I fear no money either. Not for want of trying. Success has not been as one envisaged yet. I even inserted a discreet advertisement in The Lady, but the only answer I got was from the two gentlemen I mentioned. So you see darling, however delightful it would be to have all these young people staying here, for me to accommodate such a large party at the moment would be financially impossible. - You mean the Bovington Health Farm consists of you and McKiver? - I'm afraid so, my darling. - But this is ridiculous Auntie! Health farms all over the country are making a fortune! This place, having this place, is like a licence to print money! (finger snaps) I've got an idea. (laughing) - Maury? - Yeah? - Prepare yourself for a new life. In these surroundings, we can work undisturbed, peace and tranquillity no bother our fortune. I take it that the plates are not damaged? - Oh, they're as good as new, believe me. They don't make 'em like this anymore. When do we get cracking? - Oh, possibly tomorrow. - Aye, here, what about that McKiver chap and that lady, whatchamacallit? You don't think they'll twig, do you? - No, not in a million years. They'll never hear the sound of this over that organ. We found the perfect set up! (laughs) (birds chirping) (rooster crows) (door squeaks) - Wakey, wakey, rise and shine. - Hey! (groaning) - Maury, will you stop doing that! - Good morning. (laughs) - Good morning. I believe you must be in the wrong room. - Ah, no she isn't. - We're ready for you. - No, no, there must be some mistake. - No mistake, no mistake. - Are you coming? - Yes. - Oh no, you're not. Now, we're here for the cure, you know. - But we are the cure. - I knew it had to be something more than nuts and cold water. - No you're not, this is most irregular. - Here, perhaps they're part of the treatment. - Ridiculous. Will you please leave our room immediately. - Come on girls, let's get moving! (groovy music) (laughing) - Oh my God, I can't stand much more of this, can you? Thank goodness! Get me out of here, darling. I can't stand it, I can't. No, no! (steam whooshing) My God Maury! Maury, come back! (languid groovy music) - Something I can do for you, chum? - I'm looking for a gentleman. - No gentleman in here. It's all crumpet. - Crumpet? Crumpet. Oh, oh, you misunderstand me. I'm to meet a business associate here for drinks. - Oh yes, come on, I'll find you a bottle and the fellow. - Oh thank you, very nice of you. - Here you are love, sit yourself down. You've got a nice view of the stage. You sure you don't fancy a couple of birds? - Oh no thank you, I'll just wait here for my friend, if you don't mind. - Got some lovely talent. - No, thank you, no thank you. I'm all right. - Suit yourself. Reggie! Bottle of wine for the gentleman. (popping) - Good evening, Mr. Q. - Couldn't you have chosen a more secluded place than here? You've got to realise we're on very secretive work. - Oh don't worry Mr. Q, in this business you can be very safe in this environment. You see, the patrons are more interested in the convening talent. - I see your point. Now to business. When do we meet with your associate? - Ah, yes, yes, now that's a good question, good question! Any minute now. She works here as a hostess. - Here? - Yes. - Are you mad? - No, I'm hardly mad, Mr. Q. We'll have to infiltrate the crevices of the mob. Now, she's my inside man, as it were. Now, I've made my presence known and she'll come over and you'll be expected to meet like you fancy her, so to speak. - Fancy her? But I can't do that! I'm a married man of 20 years! - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Well, pretend to fancy. Avert suspicion. - I would thought these aren't in my line of country, I would have thought it-- - May I sit down? - Oh yes, please do, make yourself comfortable. This is my friend, Mr. Q. This is Christine, I was telling you about. - Delighted to meet you, my dear. I hope you will join us in some refreshment. - I'd love to. - I take it our colleague here has given you the relative information regarding our assignment. - Yes, to a point. - It's all very undercover, you realise? - Of course. - Mr. Nosegay has acquainted me with your talents. - Has me? - Oh, oh, I mean, your talents regarding yourself as an agent. - I'm your girl. - Capital. We believe that a large proportion of the counterfeit notes can possibly be passed in places such as this. We want you to keep your eyes peeled and if you notice anything out of the ordinary being passed, contact Nosegay here immediately. He's in constant contact with me. - Yes, but what am I to look for exactly? I mean, how I meant to distinguish between the duds and the real thing? - Ah, very little, I'm afraid. One of the most remarkable examples of engraving I've seen in many a day. That, the only defect is the highlight in her majesty's left eye. - Goodness me! It's perfect! - Regrettably, nearly so. Nevertheless, we'll get the scoundrels. (laughs) Very few villains have slipped past me, by jove, I can tell you. - I can that just by looking at you. - Well, let's drink to the success of our mission. Success! - Well, I've enjoyed our brief meeting. I hope we shall meet again in the near future. Nosegay, keep in contact. Close contact. Until we meet again. Goodbye. - Missed it. - Oh, oh, thank you, thank you, I'm very awfully sorry. - That's quite all right my matey. Don't worry. - Only you're very nice, thank you very much. - Oh, there's my boyfriend. You don't need me anymore, do you? I must go and earn my living. - Yes, that's right love, you're going to attend to his every need and the best of luck. - Hello girl. - Hello Norman. Had a good day? - No. Been thinking like the talent, must've lost its way. Come home last, dancing on three legs. - The problem with you mate, is you don't study! You want to get anywhere, you've got to study. - Love the show and go get something, all right. John Billet playing the records and welcome and it's smoky. We seem to be full tonight folks and we're share again, with audio sets this thing in somo, I tell you. (playful groovy music) - Now here's one, what about this Norman? Removing tomorrow in the 3:30. - Could be. Send fellows out in Brighton. - Look at that bleedin' horse up there. Who put her in? She'd been better off with the bleedin' shadow. Look at the go she's got mate, she wouldn't be much of a ride either! Oh for Christ's sake, pay her off tomorrow. Makes you put the punters off of women. Now, what about it, Norman? Gonna have a go on the Mona? I'm a bit off 100 on the nose. - Yeah, I'll run a monkey on the neck. - I'd like a flatter if you think it stands a chance. - I know you with your bleeding fetters! The last time you flood the bank I never saw the colour of the gilt! If you want, oh put your money where your mouth is. Now what do you want, aye? Oh. You did all right tonight. Right, 20 pound on the nose. (birds chirping) - I want to go home. They're killing us. - Morris, enough is enough. In any case, we haven't any more money to go further afield. And remember our purpose here. - I know the purpose! If I have to go through that bashing everyday, we'll never live to spend it. - We've got to stick it out. (groaning) What's the matter with ya? - Oh sod you! If you want to stay, you stay, I'm getting back to civilization! - Here, Maury, come back! - Where the hell do you think you're going? ♪ It's great to be here ♪ ♪ There never ever could be anywhere else for we ♪ ♪ This is where we want to be ♪ ♪ Enjoying ourselves ♪ ♪ It wouldn't be right ♪ ♪ To go on criticising anywhere nice as this ♪ ♪ There is such great happiness ♪ ♪ If what everyone we're getting free exercise ♪ ♪ No bed all this time ♪ ♪ It's good for us ♪ ♪ We're beginning to feel that this is the real Shangri la ♪ ♪ There's nothing on earth ♪ ♪ Would ever make us try to leave all our friends behind ♪ ♪ When we're so well wined and dined ♪ ♪ It's great to be here ♪ (plucky mid tempo music) ♪ It's great to be here ♪ ♪ There never ever could be anywhere else for we ♪ ♪ This is where we want to be ♪ ♪ Here enjoying ourselves ♪ ♪ It wouldn't be right ♪ ♪ To go on criticising anywhere nice as this ♪ ♪ There is such great happiness ♪ ♪ Here for everyone ♪ ♪ We're getting free exercise no bed all the time ♪ ♪ It's good for us ♪ ♪ We're beginning to feel that this is a real Shangri la ♪ ♪ There's nothing on earth ♪ ♪ Would ever make us try to leave all our friends behind ♪ ♪ When we're so well wined and dined ♪ ♪ It's great to be here ♪ (groovy music) - Hello, Bovington Manor. Week of the 31st. Week of the 31st. Yes, I think I can fit you in with a double room for that date. Will you be taking the full course? Oh yes, we include colonic irrigation, when requested, oh certainly! Our young ladies handle all the treatments. Oh thank you, that would be most gracious of you, a slight deposit would be much appreciated. Well, thank you again, goodbye. What the hell is colonic irrigation Mr. McKiver? I haven't the foggiest, have you? - Oh aye, colonic irritation, I can, it's...(laughs) There's nothing to it, it's, it's a kind of foot massage, very beneficial for the patients who have to take brisk, early morning walks. - Oh, I see. - Good morning miss. I'm due here, it says on the card. - Oh yes, you're down for our 2:30 appointment. Would you like to take off your gown and go and lie on your tummy over on the couch? - Right you are. (humming) Thank you very much, thank you, thank you. Ah, it's lovely. - Uh, take off your pants. - Is that really necessary, I mean... - You're down for irrigation, aren't you? - Yes, yes, well actually, I've got an ache across my shoulder here and the ladyship outside said it would do me good, so I came long. - Oh, I suppose it might help. Now Mr. Benjamin, no need to be shy, off with them. - No, I there really is, I mean-- - Nothing to worry about. - You've seen it all before, haven't you, I mean. - Oh yes, we'll give you a little massage first. That'll relax you. - My first time here, you know. - No need to worry. - My wife recommended I come along because-- - Oh, we'll sort you out. - Oh thank you very much, thank you, oh charming. Oh, oh! (groaning) I never dreamed it would be like this. This is irrigation, give me more, give me more more more. Oh, more please, please, please! Oh don't stop, don't stop, don't stop. - No, I won't Mr. Benjamin. There was nothing to worry about, was there? - No, not at all, not at all, nothing at all. Oh I like that, I like that, beautiful! Oh yes! (groaning) - Mr. Benjamin, you are hard. Your core muscles really need relaxing. - Yes, oh yes they do, don't they, yes, yes. Keep it coming, oh, oh. Oh! - There, you're much more relaxed now, aren't you? - Oh yes, thank you, thank you very much. - Oh good, there. Now for irrigation. - Well I... I thought that was it, irrigation. That's not irrigation? - Oh no, Mr. Benjamin, stay there, we'll sort you out. - Charming lady, charming. Irrigation, irrigation. - Now this, Mr. Benjamin, is irrigation. (yelling) (horn blaring) - This is class? That's what I call bleedin' class, what do you think Chris? - Looks all right from the outside. But anyhow, did we want to come all this way just for a weekend, though? I'd of rathered gone to Brighton. - You've got no appreciation of bloody beauty, haven't you? You can't see this sort of scenery down south! Last time we was Brighton, all we saw was the bleedin' water! Come on, let's go inside. - May aye be of assistance to you? - Yes sir, we booked reservations. Blitz the name, Norman Blitz. - You'll be needed over yon to sign the reservations. Have you any other baggage with you? - Oh yes, the rest of it's outside in the Mercedes, you can't miss it, it's the only one there. - I'll attend to that for you. You better go over to yon desk and meet her ladyship. - Oh her ladyship, oh yes! Come on Chris. - Find some luggage out there in the Mercedes. Her ladyship-- - Can I help you? - Oh yes madam, we've made reservations. Blitz the name, Norman Blitz. - Blitz. Ah yes, here we are. Welcome to Bovington Hall, Mr. Blitz. We have the most delightful rooms for you. - Thank you. Rooms, I only booked one! - Oh yes, I do apologise about that. All our doubles were fully booked. However, I'm sure you'll find these reservations extremely comfortable, delightful views over the grass moors. - Jesus Christ! - It's a pity you are only staying for the long weekend. However, not to worry, we at Bovington can work wonders in a minimal space of time. (bell dings) - Can't wait. - Now, these are two of our young ladies, Josie and Tess. I tell you what I suggest, as you can only stay here for such a very short time, I suggest Tess and Josie conduct you to the baths as soon as you're ready. - The sooner the better aye! Can't wait to take a few pounds off! (water splashes) (organ music) - Chris? What the hell are you doing here? - Rod! I don't believe it. I thought you were still in Paris! Anyway, what's all this about my doing here? What the hell are you doing here, you bastard? Last time I saw you was in New Castle, when you left me with nothing but a bloody paste engagement ring and what I thought at the time, was a bun in the oven. - You weren't preggers were you darling? - Well, no, but it's no thanks to you. - Darling, darling let me explain. - Forget it. If it hadn't been for me bumping into a very old friend of mine, who I met while landed up there with cash and waiting for you, I could have been stuck up there forever. - Cat, really I didn't mean it. I was dropped right in the cart. You know, I was supposed to come back to England from Paris the week after I left you in New Castle. Well, that shit of a partner of mine got off in the middle of the night, left me stranded with the six girls I took over a strip club engagement. Apart from them, all I had was a bloody bus. We had to sell everything, all our resources, just to get back to England. - What are you doing here? I mean, surely they don't have strip shows here. - My aunt owns the manor. - What? That old woman, lady whatever her name is? - Right. The place was a shambles and we eventually managed to make it here. But I turned it into what it is now. - And what about the birds? - They're the staff, them and some poor old sod called McKiver. And as you can see, it's all happening. - Where do I come into it? - Well, where we left off, if you want. - You know something Rodney, you have to be the most complete and utter bastard of the very first order. - You see, nothing's changed and you still fancy me, don't you? - Give yourself a chance to find out. - Look, I can't go away now. I've got to go and take care of reception, but keep yourself open for this evening. - Do you know the number of my room? - Don't need it, won't be necessary. There are certain things happening tonight. Be at the pool, 12 o'clock. - The pool? You must be joking. Surely, we must be past having it away on the concrete by now, aren't we? - It won't be like that. Just make sure you're there and the rest I'll take care of. - I can imagine, I've been in vogue with your bright ideas before, remember? ♪ Pretty girl ♪ ♪ Oh la la la oh la pretty girl ♪ ♪ P is for the pouting lips ♪ ♪ That make me want to kiss you ♪ ♪ R is for the rainbow that is dancing in your eyes ♪ ♪ E is for the ever present smile that lights your face up ♪ ♪ T is for the tenderness and love that never dies ♪ ♪ Pretty girl come with me ♪ ♪ And I'll buy you all the nice things you adore ♪ ♪ Pretty girl stay with me ♪ - Come along, Mr. Wilson. ♪ And you'll never have to worry anymore ♪ ♪ T is for the times you tried to make my life a pleasure ♪ (laughing) (coughs) - Oh, well thanks!

Tell you what, let's go and give that bastard of a comedian a bit of a go, aye? - Yeah, good idea. - Now, what's it gonna be? The ball, the cards or the hand? - What? Oh, I don't want to buy anything. - Oh no you don't understand. You can have the ball, the cards or the hand. Of course, I've got the fluence to use them all. - Lying bitch! - Shut up, you silly bugger! I am sorry sir, now what's it gonna be? The ball, the card or the hand. - Well, whatever you suggest. - Oh I am glad that you said that, sir. Course, looking at you, I'd say the hand with a little bit of the ball thrown in. I must tell ya in all fairness, the hand isn't for-- - Why, it says outside the entire reading for one pound. - Oh, you're dead right on that score, sir! Being a Romani, you've got to cross my hand with silver, you do understand, don't ya? - I see. - Don't delve too deep, sir. (laughs) Oh, 50 pence pieces if you please, sir. Ah, that's all right. Now give me your hand, your left one and let us see what we can see. Oh, there's plenty here. It's as plain as the nose on my face. You've had trouble with a man, haven't ya? - Two men, actually. - No, there's only one man and he's in a high place. You're on a quest and I can see stones. Have you had an illness recently? - No, not that I can think of. - Gallstones? - [Podsnap] No, I had a touch of bronchitis the last month. - No, it's not that. I can only see stones. You're surrounded by them. Are you sure you haven't had any trouble with the old water works? - Quite sure! - All I can see is stones. Stones and stones. - Stones? Brighton beach, they're the stones! I'm on the right path! - No, no, you're not where you should be. You're on a quest and it's further afield, but you're gonna travel. That's that line there that tells me that. I think I'll look at me ball. Ah yes, it's coming clearer now, there we are. There's someone very high up, who's gonna drop of load of trouble on your shoulders. (yelling) Oh, I am sorry, sir! But you see, since he's been living on the pier, I ain't been able to get him house trained. But wait a minute, oh it's coming through now, yes. I've got to be very blunt about this. Have you had anything to do with any women lately? - No, not that I can think of. - Well, I can see the letter C, C, C, C! Maybe Christopher? - Christine. - Ah, it's coming very near now. I think I'll use me cards. - Please do, do try the cards! Yes, tell me more, tell me more! - Now, sit quiet, sir, you sit there and I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm going to let it come out all natural like. Tell me, tell me! You are going where birds fly free! Stones, stones! Look for the stones! Oh dear, I'm exhausted. I've told you everything. I've given you a double helping of everything, the balls, the cards, and the hand. I think I'll charge you a little bit more, it's only fair, isn't it? Blimey, I can't change this. - Now you're sure I've got to look for the stones? - You can depend upon it. You can take the word of a Romani. (bird caws) - Lies, all lies! - I'll kill you, you bastard! (birds chirping) - Would you like an extra slice of lemon, Mr. Kelly? - Thank you. (steps clattering) - You certainly manage to find the best places for a swinging weekend, don't you? - It'd do you good to cut the day and just take some weight off your ass. - I've never had any complaints about my ass, as you so delicately put it, up until now. - Look, do me a favour, keep quiet and get on with it. Aye, aye, what's this? - What is that? - Oh, it's nothing much. - Well, if it's nothing much, can I have a look at it please? - There you are. - Swimming pool, midnight. How weird. Course you're not going, are you? - Course not, don't be silly! - Did you manage to get all the cards out? - Yes, everybody's got one. - All except for the two nutters down at the end there. Rodney told us not to take any chances with them. - Oh, you mean Clapworthy and Kelly? - Yeah. - Oh, I shouldn't think they'd add much vigour to the proceedings. - You can say that again. - Although, in a funny kind of way, I feel rather sorry for them.

I'm starved, I'm absolutely famished! I haven't eaten all day. Rodney, if you really think I'm meant to feel randy, sprawled out there like some tomato plants and horse manure, you've got another think coming. - Don't worry, I've got everything ready, I've sorted all the before this shit even started. Don't I always think of everything? - You've no need to tell me that one. I must be mad to even consider this. - Sweetie, rely on me. - If only I could. All right then, but if this is another of your bright little ideas that goes wrong, your feet won't touch the ground. - Cross my heart. Now, go on, off you go and I'll meet you later. - Don't you let me down. - I won't. Arnia, can you hold the fort by the till a little while? I've got a little bit of business I've got to attend to. - Yes, I know, I saw a bit this evening. Go on, have fun. (water splashing) (laughing) - Hello, where are you off to? - Well, I've got some unfinished business to do, know what I mean? - Yes, good luck to you. (groovy music) (water splashing) (clattering) - Come on! - But the door's open. - Don't worry, they won't find us in this part of the manor. (groaning) Come on. (panting) (groaning) (screaming) - What's wrong, Maury? - Can you smell it, it's in the room? - I can't smell anything. - Food, it's food, I can smell it. - Go to sleep Maury, it's hallucinations. You usually get them when you're in a weak state. Now, just go to sleep. - I tell ya, I can't stand it, it's killing me. (people laughing) Hear, hear, did you hear that? - What? - They're laughing at us. - I can't hear anything, no. - I'll tell ya, they're laughing at us, up there. Up there, they're laughing, they're laughing at me. - Who is? - Them! They're laughing at me. It's my own fault, it's all them schmucks I cheated and turned over all me life. They're laughing at me up there. See my mother, she used to say to me, "Maury, you'll come to no good, Maury, "oh I'm telling you Maury, you'll come to no good." She wanted me to go into gowns and blouses. - You would look very good in them as well, you know that. - Gowns and blouses, she used to say. Now that's a living. - So why did you become a printer? - My mother's brother, it was his fault. He was in the business. Became some kind of partnership with him. He used to print ration cards, petrol coupons, cut tie tickets, all quality gear. I used to distribute it. - So? - So, well, I was out grafting one day at Chelsea Walhampton, I think it was. Oh, what a day! I was selling the tickets five at a time. Did you know, I had a wad of notes in me pocket like the roll of liner. Whoo, what a day whoo! - Go on. - Yeah well, one night, when I got back to the office, the law had gotten ankle mental. - I remember that. - Two years they give him. So all of a sudden I found myself managing director, didn't I? I thought, well, I'll go into a better quality type of good. Passports, diplomas, something with a bit of finesse. Well, for this, I needed a good engraver. (laughs) - That's how you met me. - I met ya. I shoulda stayed in gowns and blouses. Instead, I find myself in this mashugana place, starving to death! - Look, for goodness sake, go to sleep. In a couple of weeks we'll have enough money here to get out and you can eat yourself to death. Now, go to sleep for God sake! - Well, sorry if I disturbed you. - Well, you are disturbing me, so go to sleep, please. - Just, I thought I could smell food. - Well, go to sleep, I don't smell anything. (snoring) - What's the matter? - Maury, you aggravate me, you just plain aggravate me. - But where you going? - I'm going to have a pee, do you mind? Where are you going? - Well... - Go back to bed, you've already been, go back to bed. (heavy breathing) (water running) (moaning) - What's that? - Oh, it's nothing, don't worry about it. (moaning) (laughing) (champagne pops) - I'll say, this really is the most enchanting room. So unexpected, coming across a place like this, so off the beaten track. And jolly decent of you to bring this up to the room personally. I mean, you do understand it would be rather embarrassing, somebody in my position I can't very well pop in down there. You do understand? - [Woman] Don't give it another thought, Sir Jeffery. - Oh please, call me Jeffery. - Jeffery. And I do understand. We here at the manor always have the interests of our guests at heart. - I was rather hoping that this was going to be well, a little bit more than, shall we say, a service of the establishment? - Well, we do try to please. (groovy music) - Bloody hell darling, you could've waited. - I couldn't, I've ravenous! - More like ravishing. What a wonderful idea, in fact. What is wrong with this! (moaning) (laughing) (sighs) (moaning) - No, no! (laughs) - No, oh I'm coming, yeah! (moaning) (women chattering) - Well Rodney, you look a bit baggy around the eyes this morning. You must've run the ball well and truly last night. - Nevermind about that. How'd it all go last night? - Pretty well, although I have a few things to clear up with the girls before we start today's manoeuvres. - Okay, let's get started. We mustn't slack now everything's going so well for us. Come on, get the girls in order. - Okay, come on girls, quiet, quiet please! Thank you. Right, let's go through today's briefing. First of all, I think we can up the temperature in the steam room a little. That will help get rid of some of the booze they consumed last night. Um, I think perhaps Tess, you'd better take over this job. - But that's my job. - Well pet, look what's already happened. You've nearly asphyxiated six of our residents already. No, I think perhaps you'd better take care of the midday carrot juice instead. - And whilst we're on that subject, Mandy love, while your efforts are appreciated, no really they are really, however perhaps a little less verb. Sir Jeffery is unable to get out of bed this morning and poor Mr. Nimbly's walking around looking like a road map. - And as for you, Patsy, poor Mr. Collingworth has taken to Bovington General Hospital this morning suffering from severe lacerations. We had to tell the doctor he was hit by a falling tree. But we all know what happened, don't we? - Well, he did ask for the full treatment. - Well, I'll overlook it just this once, but don't let it happen again. - All right, let's get the ramble organised through the woods for this afternoon. That should perk up the taste buds for the evening. Tina? - Not on your life, darling. I can hardly keep awake now. We've been up all night and all this physical activity during the day is just too bloody much! If I see any more greenery, I'll just go out of my mind, I promise you I will! Why doesn't the Amazon take care of it? - Patsy, how bout it? - Okay, book me in the for cross country. - Right, any more questions or suggestions? - Yes, when do we retire? - [Rodney] Keep going as we have been and you should be able to skate through to the next London season. - Thank God for that. - Shh, quiet everybody, I think I can hear McKiver. We don't kill the golden goose, now do we? - Oh, good morning, sir. What can I do for you? - Oh, I'm down for some treatment this morning. - Ah yes, have you been to the manor before? - No, no. - Then I'll get one of our young ladies to show you the way through. Nanette? - Yes? - Would you like to show Mr. Blitz the way through to the steam room please. - Morning. - Yes, certainly. Would you like to follow me, sir? - Can take me anywhere you like, love. (groans) - Do us a favour, Mr. Clapworthy, let's get out of here. Oh, I'll be satisfied with what we've got, look at me. I'm wasting away! - Listen Morris, just a few more days and we'll have reached our target. Every pound we lose in here, will be worth two and a half when on the outside. - Well, I'm not a greedy man. I'll be happy with what we've got. (steam hissing) - Maury, you'll have to stop. - Now, make yourself comfortable in here, Mr. Blitz, and I'll be back in half and hour. - All right, darling. (yells) - Them seats are half bleedin' hot! That's better. I've never been in a place like this before. Sure, I suppose this is the place to take the weight off, aye. Blitz the name, Norman Blitz. - Nice to know you. - Unusual, this lot, you know. - You'll get used to it. - Yeah well, there's nothing like sweating to throw you up, is there? - Sweatings not the only thing you get in this place. - Hey, what about them birds? What about them birds, you know, that lot that brought me in. Oh, that's a big tasty innit. - Don't talk about anything to eat. - How are you, Mr. Blitz? It's not too hot for you, is it? - Oh no, no. Now, you mustn't take too much the first day. Come along, it's time for your cold shower, Mr. Clapworthy. - Clapworthy, Clapworthy? Don't I know you from somewhere? - Oh no, I don't think you've ever had the pleasure, sir. - Now come along Mr. Kelly, you too. - Morris, how bout a shower? - Oh yes. - Here, you're the two sods what scarped! (groovy music) - Morris, pretty novel, that was one of Slasher's men in there. We're out Maur. - What we gonna do? - Bloody run! - I'm telling you Slash, the two of them are down here as large as life. Course I know it's them! Who else do you know with names like that? Jewish? Oh, I don't know I never look at them things. - Well, don't let them out of your site, Norman! Me and the two boys will up there straight away! - Right. (upbeat groovy music) - Here you are Maury, you have these. - Where we gonna put them? - Well, certainly not here. Let's hide them in the garden. - Good idea. - Come on. You take those down the back and burn 'em. - Yes. (groovy music) (clattering) - Make sure you burn them all, Maury. - What are you two up to? - Well, we thought, you see, after the shower, a bit of fresh air and exercise would do us good. - To stimulate the circulation. - Don't give me that, look at that smoke. You've been burning something. I've been watching you both from the upstairs window. - Katrina, we're in serious trouble. We are not, in fact, musicians. - That figures, after listening to "O For the Wings of a Dove" every afternoon for the past couple of months. - My correct title is Inspector Clapworthy of the British Intelligence. My colleague here is none other than the Dr. Kelly. - You see, we didn't actually arrive from Paris. No, see Miss Katrina, I've been a hunted man. I have, I've been a hunted man and the only organisation I could turn to was MI5. It was there I met the Inspector. Oh, what a man. - And the bonfire, where does this hunted bit come in? - Yeah well, you see, I was making these plans and blueprints for a new revolutionary hivercraft. - Hover, hover. - Hov-- - Hover. - Hover, hey. - Just tell the girl the story. - Yeah, well unfortunately see, unbeknownst, there was a leak in the security, you see. The news had got out about my good fortune and all the people, the whole of London was hunting me then. Yeah, but unfortunately see, this mob got to hear about it. Now they're hearing chasing us and they want to do us! - But can't you call the police? - No, no, no. We of the service always work alone. - Together. - But if they're coming here, what are you going to do? - Well, as others have done before us, go down but with our chins held high. - There must be something we can do. - Well, you think about it Miss Katrina and while you're doing that, the Inspector and I will go off and pack. - That's a good idea. - I know, I've got it! The girls! - Are you certain it's them? - Course I'm certain and I'll check with the porter. He said they arrived the day after we found out they scarpered from London. And what's more, they took two big boxes up to their rooms. - And that's how it happened, that's exactly what they told me. (women chattering) - Ah, if only the General was here now. But by the way, I was his pattern in the 1914 and 19 knot. Here, the satin act of going to the plate and then in with a cold steel! Ah! Now then, you right here, and I'll go away and get me pipes. That'll scare the shit out of them! - Come on girls, into action! (men chattering) - Come along, gentlemen. Come on! - Where are you taking us? - I don't want to go down there again! We've just come up from there! - All right, you go in there, I'll get him him. - Okay. (thuds) - That's another one down. - Great stuff. - Come on, mate, that is enough, we'll have the rest later. - Oh no, I'm afraid I can't let you go yet! - Lady Bovington insists on the full treatment at all times! (whistles) - Oi, get off of me! (girls yelling) - Maury, we'd better get back to the garden. Get them plates, quick, let's go. - Can I help you? - Yes, missus. I'm looking for the you know what. - Ah, straight down the corridor and turn left. (steps clattering) Good morning, Vicar. - I believe our Virgil phoned you yesterday with regards to the scouts bazaar. - I do know that Mr. McKiver has removed most of the unwanted bric a brac out to the potting shed. If you care to rummage about there, I'm sure you're more than welcome to take anything you could find you think will come in useful. - Most generous of you, Lady Bovington. We have a barrel outside. May we pop down now? - Well, do, please do! - Oh, thank you so much! Hope to see you at the service on Sunday. - Sunday. - Now come along, troop. To work, to work! - Right, scout master! Everything's ready and under control. - Quick march. - Ah, there you are. We've been waiting for you in the exercise room. - Yeah, I'll pick the scarper. - Unlikely! Come on, girls, get him! - Positive gold mine. Here. - Vicar? - Yes, Trixie? - Will these go? - Oh, what a bountiful harvest. All this should fill a complete stall. Oh, these appear to be copper, how excellent for the scout's metal class. I shall place them upon the barrel. Excuse me, Trixie. (hissing) - Oh! Bleedin' hell. Are you kinky or something? You say you come here for pleasure. I wonder how the other two are getting on? - Come on lads, keep up the good work, no slacking now! (groans) - Oh, there they are. Come on, they're useless! We'd better find them on our own! - I'll get the plates. - I'll see all the notes are burnt. - Right. (cart clattering) - Come on, mate! What are you doing? Can't you see? - My word, what exuberance. - You seem to have collected quite an assortment for your bazaar. - Oh Lady, what I have here would make a most delightful display. - I'm sure it will. I didn't see them used. - They were down by the shed with all this. - Do you know I think these might belong to Rodney. I think we ought to show him them before you hand them to your helpers. - Well, I quite understand, my dear lady. I mean, anything that isn't needed, young Trixie here can come up and collect later. - Oh good. - Certainly, I mean to show them to Rodney now. - My dear lady, good day. - Goodbye. - Well done, come on troop, quick march. - Right girls, we got rid of the toss, now we've got to get rid of the ring leaders. Look, there they go! Come on, let's get 'em! (groovy music) (yelling) (booming) - There? - Yeah, Lady B! Now then, don't make a pig of yourself with that. - Yeah, of course I do see your point of view, but you've got to see our point of view too. I mean, you're gonna be taking a strict rotation innit ya? Well, I do the best for you. Three weeks from now, now that is a promise, mate! Now we've got a bunch of sod amerous kudus on the run now. As soon as we carry that lot, we'll run your lot in the machine a bit sharpies, what. Okay! Okay, our pleasure Mr. Gunnerfort. We'll be in touch! - Everything going according to plan? - Oh, couldn't be better, my love. Shall we make our rounds now or are you a bit tied up? - No! Lena can hold the fort. We must show some interest in the work, mustn't we? Else Mr. Clapworthy and Kelly will go into their sulks again. We can't have that, can we? - Quite right. ♪ Oh for the wings of the wings of a dove ♪ ♪ Far away far away would I roam ♪ ♪ All for the wings for the wings of a dove ♪ ♪ Far away far away ♪ ♪ Far away ♪ - Your should be identical to mine. - Oh, I am not! ♪ All for the wings for the wings of a dove ♪ ♪ Far away far away would I roam ♪ ♪ All for the wings for the wings of a dove ♪ - The stones!
