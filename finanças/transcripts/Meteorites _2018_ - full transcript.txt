METEORITES Fuck! Think this is vacation? Sorry, I ran into traffic. Right. Traffic, my alarm didn't go off... I don't care. This is a job. You must be on time. Don't do it again. Here. Got it? The tour begins in 10 minutes. You can wait over there. - Thank you, have a nice day. - You too. What high school are you in? I quit school. It wasn't for me. And you? I'll be working at a friend's sister's store in Paris. Paris, the Champs-Elys√©es... I can't wait. I'll have a flat and everything. Too cool. Hello. 14.99 euros, please. Have a good day. Alex... Alex? Alex! C'mon Nina, put on some tunes. Wait a minute. They might mention it. Enough now, stop. You stop! Hands off. We got no reception. - Go fuck yourself. - Excuse me? You never believe me! You're my friend but you never believe me. I believe you. Djamila! - Yeah? - The keys! No hello? - Move your ass, I'm busy. - Lost your keys, dummy? Just wanted to see my beloved sister! Change your tone if you want the keys. Please Djamila, will you give me the keys? - Only out of pity. - Hop to it. Watch your mouth. So you're Djamila's brother? Cops hire kids now? Yeah, for all the summer wankers. What d'you want? Need something? What're you doing tonight? Hangin', you? Dunno. Hangin' with you? I could pick you up and take you home. Ok. What's your name? - Morad. - Nina. How old are you? 19, you? 16. It's hot! Seriously, fatso? Think you're tough? Showing off for the ladies? - I'll join the army with you, for fun. - What would you do? Dunno, hairstylist. Shave heads all day? Yeah. Shave you all like sheep. Who's the guy? What guy? C'mon, everyone saw you. Stop moving. - Who was he? - Nobody. Hanging with Arabs now? Racist like your friends now? - Head down. - Stop it girl, listen to me. - Head down! - Listen to me. Don't hang with just anybody. You don't realize. Do you hear me? - Stop and listen. - Fine, I'm done anyway. But I'm not. Listen for real for a sec. I heard you. You think you're big but you're still a kid. Don't forget. Love Silly boy... You there? Yeah, whassup? I'm going to Dune this weekend. Wanna come? Nah, that club is for bums. You're the bum. Haha! Then maybe I'll come. I used to think the characters were behind the TV set. At first I was afraid to look. Then I saw Snow White and wanted to talk to her. So I went back there, but no Snow White. Only black cords. Electrical cords. Does your brother have a girlfriend? He's married. For real, he's married. No lie, he's married. Why do you ask? I don't know, I like him. I know he's gorgeous. Like his sister, of course. But don't try, Nina. - Why not? - I know my brother. You'll come to me and say, "Djamila, I should've listened. He left me, cheated on me." You're horrible. I speak the truth. We'll see. Yes, Mom? Yes, I'm fine. It's a veritable disaster scenario. A giant meteorite is about to strike the earth. The dinosaurs, and two thirds of all other species, are doomed. In less than 24 hours, this collision could change the history of our planet. Did such an event trigger the extinction of the dinosaurs? Let's go back in time 65 million years. Reptiles are herbivores. They eat herbs, like we eat salad. They're not reptiles, they're reptilians, that's different. They live underground. In another world. Like ours, but underground. There's nothing underground. Just fire. They come up to the earth. On the earth, they take on the appearance of human beings to control the world. What the hell? They even eat people to get strong. - Like we eat food. - You're crazy. They want to control the world. Justin Bieber, Barack Obama, all the politicians. They're reptilians. You've been smoking. Here, mellow out. I haven't, but I will now. What're you doing this fall? - Prep studies. - In what? Literature. Cool, you've got brains. Unlike him. And you, Nina? What do you see me doing? - Circus performer. - Right! - What do you do? - Nothing. - Nothing? - I don't know. Thank you. You ok, Nina? Want something to eat? Fuck... Thanks. - What happened last night? - Dunno... I don't remember. Did I wake you? No, Morad woke me. You're lucky he found you. You should quit the drugs. Want some milk? Yes, please. Do your parents know I slept here? Yeah, don't worry. What do they do? My mom's a school cleaner. My dad's in Algeria. I see him when he comes here. Which isn't often. - Can I take a shower? - Sure. Grab some clothes too. You stink! Whassup? Sleep well? - Yeah, you? - Yeah. Where'd you get the T-shirt? I rock it, right? Looks good. But I don't like snoops. Your sister gave it to me. - Do you play? - Yeah. Show me your stuff. That's illegal! Why're you looking at me? Why're you looking at me? Because you're looking at me. You don't have to. C'mon, cut it out! The shockwaves move through space toward a vast hydrogen cloud. The cloud implodes, sending out rings of gas and dust. At its core, a veritable nuclear oven is set ablaze. Our sun has just been born. A gigantic cauldron of energy, a colossus containing 99% of the original cloud matter. The remaining 1% condenses to create the 9 planets of our solar system. - What's for dinner? - I won't be here. Why not? I'm going out. Going out... with who? No way! - Who? - You don't know him. What's his name? - I'm not telling. - Why not? If I don't know him, why not? No, stop it! Don't sneak away. Why are you being so mysterious? I'm a woman of mystery. Right, I forgot. Yeah, you? Yeah. Will you come here? To get me? Morad! Come swim! The water's really nice! Put your knees together... Hands here, arms straight. - Like this? - Yeah. - Ready? - Go for it. You're a little monkey! You know, just before we met, I saw a meteorite in the sky. It went down behind the mountain. I thought it was the end. But this is what it meant. That we were going to meet. It was a sign. - Guys, get back with your group. - Get lost! - Hurry up. - Shut up, lady. It bit me! Ok, I'm calling security. Get a move on! Calling who? - Nina to security... - Yes, Nina, go ahead. I've got 3 little assholes in Cretaceous. Come again? - 3 little what? - 3 little assholes! Get the fuck outta here! Seriously? You crazy ho, hitting a kid! Think you own the place? You bet I own it. I'll call the manager. He'll fire you. You're not allowed to hit kids. I'm callin' the cops on you, for hitting a kid. - Did you try to negotiate? - Why bother? Should've called me. Those kids are local. So it's my fault? 'Course it is. Are you retarded? You can't hit kids for foul language. - That's not life. - You know life? Sure I do. Better than you. What're you implying? Here. Hang on. What's going on with my brother? What do you mean? Think I'm blind? That's his jersey. I'm with him. So what? He's not with you, Nina. He's playing, he'll dump you. We'll see. - Don't come crying to me. - Don't worry. Bye, see you later. Enjoy your vacation. Whassup, girl? - Need anything? - No thanks. - You sure? - Yeah. We got everything. Have a nice day. Hello? Hi, it's me. Yeah, so? I've been trying to call you. So? - What? - So? Dunno, I'm thirsty. Can I come up? What for? Are you kidding me? I walked 2 hours. I don't give a fuck. Did I invite you? Since when do you decide? I'll call you. Bye. Hello? You suck eggs! I just walked 2 hours! Think you're a god or what? I'm not moving! - How's it hangin'? - Good, you? Chillax. - Are you lost? - No, waiting for someone. - Who? - Morad. - No way, Morad? - Is there a problem? - Got any friends for us? - Hands off! Hands off? Watch your mouth. You're on my couch. Careful, she'll eat you up. She's a joke. I'm just chilling! - It's my couch. - So? - C'mon! - Am I your property too? - This is my turf. - Stop breaking my balls. Wait outside his door. I was fine, stop breaking my balls! Show some respect. Nina! Yo, Nina. - Have a nice day. - Fuck off. - What's with her? - Check your girlfriend. What was she doing on my couch? Your ass has been glued to it for 15 years. What's that skank want? You ok? Sulking? Are you serious? Ever been to Algeria? No. - What's your dad do there? - Makes olive oil. Why aren't you with him? Do I look like a farmer? - Did you quit school? - Yeah. Me too. I did 2 years in juvenile detention. We learned to ride horses there. What a joke. Why, what'd you do? Nothing major. - How's your dealing going? - What dealing? I'm unemployed. We could team up. Off we go to Columbia, to work with Tony Montana? See Pablo Escobar and all that? Is that it? Screw this. I'm outta here. - Pissed off? - Fuck you. - Get lost. - Shut your trap. I won't run after you. You old witch. C'mon! Go fuck yourself. C'mere! I just lit a smoke! - When it's done, I'm gone. - Smoke fast and scram! So stuck up! Hey, kid! C'mere! Go on, get lost! Nina, c'mere! No! Bring me back my helmet. It was expensive. Fuck... Shut up! - You're my compass, Nina! - Right. I need you! - How are you? - What brings you here? I came to see you. - How was the internship? - Good. So, did you enlist? I leave in September, after the grape harvest. What about your dad? - What about him? - What'll he do? He'll figure it out. Sell the place. It's his vineyard, not mine. - Isn't it nice here? - Are you serious? The world's going to shit. We can't hide in our mountains. Gotta do something. What, go waste people? That's not what the army's about. I won't disappear. You'll get killed. What kind of shithole is this? - It'll be worse! - Take it off. - Are you cold? - I am. - C'mon! - Cut it out. - C'mon! - I'm not here to dance. I said no. You suck! Got a cigarette? Shit. Will you call me? - Honestly. - I'm sure I sent a text earlier. Who are you? Nobody. Been here long? Seen an iPhone lying around? No. - Empty your pockets. - I'm not doing that. If you're innocent, empty them. No, I'm not a thief. - Hurry up. - C'mon, do it. - Hands off! - Empty your pockets. - Empty your pockets. - Hands off! What's your problem? Get the fuck out of here! - Fuck off! - Where's my phone? I'll mess you up! Fuck off! Like spitting on people? Where is it? Nina! C'mon, let's go. Those three rich bitches ganged up on me. So what? You got a thrashing! You're not the first. C'mon, or I'll leave without you. Go ahead, get lost. It's always the same. You're only nice when you wanna fuck. You suck! You bore the shit out of me! I'm not happy. Fuck off! You're so clueless. Fuck. Are you through? - Let me see. - Hands off. - Let me see. - Hands off! Let me see. Come here. You're a warrior. Did it hurt? No, it felt good. That's what I wanna hear. Let's go. I'll do my business and we'll get lost. Look. Morad. Proud of yourself, you retard? I bring you to a party on business and you steal phones? Brainless! Who's gonna pay for it? - A lousy dealer is criticizing me? - Gimme the phone. - Take the phone back, you dog! - Fuck off. Asshole! More? Thanks. The French Air Force pilots are ready to launch preliminary air strikes before the final assault on Raqqa, which the West considers... Guys. Hey, guys! - Why you yellin'? - Where's Morad? He took off. - Where to? - A whorehouse in Spain. He got a new girlfriend. He's gone. Up in smoke. Come eat with us. Wanna drink? - We got everything! - Merguez and stuff. - Why you want Morad? - I got something of his. Give it to me. I'll give it to him. Didn't he tell you? - No, where is he? - He went to Algeria. To his dad's. - Are you kidding me? - No, for real. I wouldn't tell you otherwise. - When'll he be back? - Dunno. Don't wait. Forget him. Nina? Why the long face? Are you ok? Yeah. Wanna come up? Is he really gone? Yeah. And you knew? Of course. You don't give a fuck if I make a fool of myself. Don't say that. Guys are like that. They disappear, I told you. Morad is a ghost. Here. Take this. Eat it, burn it. I don't give a fuck. Where're you going? - Don't leave. - Hands off. Don't leave. Hands off! What's up? - What is it? - I want to leave. Go home? Not now, it's only 7. What's wrong? What's wrong? Don't blow smoke at me. You're a drag. Why're you sulking like this? - What's the matter? - I don't feel like it. Stop. Stop. Feeling better? No. Where does it hurt? My belly. I feel like puking. I'll take you home after we fill this bin, ok? Alex! Get your butt over here! Take it up a notch. Follow my lead. You need to pick up the pace. - Are you tired? - I'm fine. - Tell me. - Cut it out. Are you asleep? - Am I complaining? - No, but you're dragging. Anyway, you weren't made for the vineyard. Though the color resembles your camouflage. - No one's made for it. - Wrong. People are made to make wine? Some people make good money. In the army you'll be doing grunt work. You make money with this? You up and joined the army! That's not it. You'll see the world on foot. It's no picnic. I won't live on a tractor. That'll be 4.90 euros, please. - Are you ok? - Yeah. - What's up? - I just can't sleep. Wanna smoke? No, thanks. - When do you leave in the morning? - Six. Can you drop me off in town? Of course. Cool. What're you gonna do? See some friends. Friends... I think I'm pregnant. - Have you done a test? - Yes. - A blood test or a urine test? - A urine test. It was negative. I did it about a week and a half ago. I did some internet research. Some sites say tests aren't always reliable. - How old are you? - 16. Could you be pregnant? Do you use contraception? No contraception. Would it be good news? Any particular symptoms? I get nauseous, my belly hurts, I get lightheaded, dizzy. Unfasten your pants, please. Pull them down a little. This'll be a bit cold. I'll go slowly. If it hurts, let me know. Relax. Breathe out. What's that spot there? Breathe out. Breathe in, slowly. So, there's no pregnancy. If there were, we'd see it clearly. Have you been upset or had any problems lately? No, I'm fine. Subtitles by Sionann O'Neill a.s.i.f. Subtitling TITRAFILM
