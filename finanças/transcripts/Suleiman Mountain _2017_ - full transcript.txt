Uluk! Get up. Your mama has come for you. - Mama? - Your mama is here. Get up! Sleep, sleep. Go back to sleep, children! Uluk. Get dressed quickly. - Has she came to pick me up? - Only if you'll rush. My mother will also come to pick me up soon! Get lost! Don't piss yourself! - Do you know how to write SMS? - Everybody knows. - To this number. - What should I write? I've found our son! - Is it to my father? - Yes. Can I put a smiley face after it? - What is that? - It's a joke. - And where is my father? - At work. - Zhipara, how was your trip? - Good! And how are you? Everything's fine! I thought he was lost. Did you find him? - You've made it! - Hello. - Look, how much you have grown! - Praised be Allah! Take it, have some food to eat. We're so happy for you! Take it! It's Uluk! You must be so happy that you've found him. Thank you very much! There will be a party for all of you when Karabas comes. Thank you very much! Zhipara. Will Karabas return? We need to get some rest. Let's talk later. Is this our home? Home is where you're beloved. Don't pay attention to them! They say nonsense and lame people always lie. Do you understand? Where is my father, mom? Eat. Will father come soon? What is he like? Would he take us to the lake? As days passed one after another, The time has arrived, When brave Manas turned seven, His given name was the Big Fool. No one knew that this gray-black maned sultan was a lion. When he turned eight, he was playful; Never walking on a straight path, Never listening to the words Of those who taught him, He ignored people's advice, Saying that he was a real Big Fool, The Kara Kalmyks, the Manchu people Told rumors about him. - Is this Manas? - This is Karabas - your father. Is he hero, just like Manas? Yes. Am I strong like him? Do we look alike? You are copies. Come on. Eat. - Who's that kid? Where? - He's asleep. Why? - Why he is asleep, I'm asking you! - Don't disturb him, you'll scare him! - Who is he? - Uluk. Uluk? - You'll see tomorrow. - Come on, show me now! Tomorrow! You'll only scare him! He's been asking about you all the time, waiting for you. But now you'll only scare him with your appearance. Let him sleep. You'll see each other tomorrow. Is my father strong? Is he brave? Mama, is he at work? What else did he ask? Would my father buy me a phone? Are we going to Issyk Kul together? Are we going for a hike into the mountains? He hasn't forgotten you, Karabas! He even remembers your moustache and beard! Is he courageous? Is he same as Manas? Strong? Am I the same as my father? He tired to wait for you and fell asleep. Karabas! Suleiman mountain heard our prayers. We've found him, Karabas! We've found Uluk! Karabas! But is it really Uluk? It's really him! Now we're together. We have found our son. Now we are together again. - Karabas! - I'll show you Uluk! Stop it! You'll kill her! Get back! - Pull yourself together! - Leave me! No, you'll kill her! - Please, let her go! - Get lost, I said! Please, let her go! What's wrong with you? Karabas, stop it! You'll kill her! Leave me, I told you! What will we do if she dies? Mama! - Who is it, Mama? - It's your father. Get up, let's go. You don't look like him at all. How much did she pay you? - Good day! - Good day! I heard that you have found your son! Mom, may I not wash it? Don't be afraid of him. Don't pay attention. May I stay with you? If we will wash his car, He'll be happy, you just don't know how much. Let's go. Turganbubu? Pull things out. Look, that's how you do it. You do it like this. Very simple. Hold and rub. It's easy, isn't it? He didn't do anything serious, he just got overstressed. Wash it faster. That's enough, don't cry. Let Karabas get used to his son. We've almost lost our minds when we thought that he's dead. I'm not disturbing you, don't you see it? If you don't have a place to go, don't hurry. You will have a son soon. My Grandma was a fifth wife. You can't deal with him on your own. He's mad. Tell me, who? Who is it? Tell me, who?! Who is it?! There's a magical beauty inside you! Why do you hide it? Why don't you show it to us?! You are the most beautiful woman in the world! Why do you hide it? Release it! Release it! Let out your beauty! Release it! Let your power dominate! Take an earlier time. The evening is very busy already. Is 14:30 ok? Osteochondrosis, right? Career advancement? Got it, career advancement needed. 14:30, I got it. Thank you. Zhipara is very experienced! Good! Come today! Thank you! Suleiman, I'm asking you... ...make everything fine! I'm asking you. I'll do all my best as well. I'm begging you! Take these medical herbs on empty stomach. - Twice a day. - Thank you, darling! On empty stomach, don't forget that. - Yes. - Get well! Wait! - Happiness to you! - See you next time! Happiness to you! Did you miss me? Yes, I did. Drink. You'll stop pissing yourself. - Where the heck are you heading? - My Mom told me to. Karabas, get up! Karabas! Dear! I'm begging you to leave! What's going on? Do you need money? Isn't it enough? Karabas, come on! You aren't against it, right? It's cold for our son outside, There is water everywhere. - Karabas! - What happened? I feel bad. Please, let's leave. Don't you understand that I'm worried about our child? When do we leave? Leave. I've told you she's stolen a boy. Who the heck are you?! What do you want? What is it? Who are you? Karabas! Let him go! What are you doing? Don't touch him! Move back! Get off, I said! - Stay still! - Who are you? - Let him go! - Shut up and sit down. I'll shove your tongue up your ass! I can jail you for 15 years for these words! Hands off and sit calm. - Why did you take them all? - No time to mess around. Drive on. - It's all because of the boy! - Shut up! Is it you, yeah? Yeah? Zhipara! I commanded them to find you by any cost. I'm sorry, I had no choice. He closed himself up in the room. And he doesn't let anybody in, even his kids. We tried a psychologist. But he didn't help. He has a gun in there. Zhipara, I'm so scared! You're the last hope for us! Where does it hurt? No, he is not ill. It's my Mother-in-law. Doctors convinced us that everything is going fine. And he left home for the meeting in Bishkek. But suddenly she slipped into a coma. Now he is blaming himself for not being nearby at that moment. Zhipara, what is it for? Zhipara! She can hear you! Beg her to forgive you! Ask forgiveness! Mama, I came back. Do you hear me? Forgive me! Mama, forgive me, please! I'm here. Mom, take a look at the helicopter I have. Very beautiful. So, does the watch suit me well? So pity I didn't pee myself. Could've got myself a mayors suit too. - I'm your mayor. - Is that so? What will you wear when you go to the maternity hospital? Am I right, Turganbubu? Take a look at this one. This is an expensive shop. Work in youth - Old age in abundance. That's right! Look, that one is more expensive! Mama, my helicopter is not working. Because there is no batteries. Take a seat, we'll buy you batteries soon. What kind of suit do you prefer? Business or casual? Do I look like a businessman? We have all kind of types. And we can pick up your size. And what size do I have, do you think? Kanykey, nice to meet you. - Size 52. - Good. - It's hard to breathe in here. - Go outside then. I will turn the air conditioner on. Here. Let's go and try. What about a shirt? - White? - No, let it be blue. Let's try this one. - I think it won't fit. - Why so? You'll see, it will be beautiful. Here it is. Fix the collar. Comb your hair. Karabas. Don't leave us. I'm asking you, Karabas. - Don't leave. - Stop it. Don't leave. We can't live without you. Please, don't leave us! Get up! Who are we without you, Karabas? - Get up, enough. - What about Uluk? Get up. Well? - Perfect! - Buy it first, then you can crumple it. - Do you take dollars? - Unfortunately, it's forbidden. There is an exchange place around the corner. This corner? Lenin street? Sir, leave something as a deposit. - Enough? - Yes. Uluk, come here. Come already. It's a big shop. Take these boxes away, ok? This is not appropriate. And what will I buy for you if you do that? - Batteries. - What? - Batteries. - Batteries for your helicopter. - I'm going with you. - Wait here. I will be soon. - Is it a new suit? - It couldn't be newer. - How are you? - Fine. And you? Why didn't you stay last time? - How do you do? - Drink some tea with us! - How do you like my suit? - Looks like it's made specially for you. Karabas, come here. I exchanged everything for you. - Don't waste them! - No way! - Promise? - I promise! This suit is right for you. - When will you make a party for your son? - Soon. Hello, girls! - Hello! - Good day! How much for batteries? - Twenty soms. - Ok! Do you remember your father? I remember him only singing. - What exactly? - I don't know. How is it you don't know? I hear it before I fall asleep. But in the morning I always forget. How is it possible?! Is the line busy? Yes. That's because you are calling at the same time. You should do it one after another. Go to sleep. Quiet I said, don't mess around Stop! Hey! Wait for me! Quiet, I said, it's not a bus! Wait, wait! What did he say? Hey! How are you? How is your business? Great. How are you? What number did he just say? - Sir, did you buy me batteries? - Get lost! We can reach the tech-station. But we have nothing to pay. - You gambled everything away? - Yes. - Even Elli. - Elli? Why do you think we were in a such rush? You crazy stupid women! [Elli - nickname for the cars IFAW50 in East Germany in 1965-1990] - Hello. - What problems do you have? The tire is flat. It is pierced. - Inner tire? - Yes. There's a hole in it. - I fixed it recently. - Whose job? One Russian from Bishkek. They say if you have a Russian friend - carry an axe with you. There was no axe that time. - What now? - Remove the wheel and take a closer look. Hey, jack-screw! You got this junk from your ancestors? It's my beauty, Elli. East Germany ceased to exist a long time ago. But the car is still running. Can you fix it in an hour? - I'm in a rush. - It depends on how much you pay. - I will pay well. - Deal. I have a son in the car. He's a bit ill. Take a seat. - What's wrong with your back? - It hurts. - Why do you drive then? - What can I do? Hello! Didn't you see Zhipara the Sulieman passing by? - Who? - Famous healer. - Deceiver? - She's not a deceiver! She saved the mayor last week. - And cured my father a year ago. - I've heard something. I would buy Suleiman's clay. We don't know. Didn't see her. She'd better buy another leg. Probably, she believes that the new leg will grow. Maybe this quack can glue it up with her clay? I think she has a choice of legs in her purse! Hey, did your back get worse? Zhipara! I'm looking for you the whole day! - Do you recognize me? - Of course! How is your father? I'll go and take a look at her. I want to buy some clay. - Is it you Zhipara? - Yes, it's her. We have a sick man here. Maybe you can help? Driver? Yes. - On the route Osh-Bishkek? - Yes. In January you'll be 50 years old! Yes, everything is right. Have you cheated on your wife recently? No, my wife died a short time ago. Radiculitis. Move aside. - Don't eat it. - Open your mouth. It's only a medicine. Calcium. It hurts, stop it. She made it only worse. You'll get better. Not a long time to wait. Zhipara, give me your clay, please. And you were talking about herbs. To avoid a miscarriage? - For my father. - Brew and drink it 3 times a day. No pain. - At all? - No, it's a miracle! What did you give me? It's a white clay from mountain Suleiman. - How much does it cost? - 200 and 300. Give me all of it! how much do you have? Wait, we want to buy it too. Do you have something for legs? I want those for 300. Hello, Dinara? I've found the medicine for legs! Good, I'll take it. Give me the one for legs, please. My eyes hurt. Take this for your eyes. Brew and drink it 3 times a day. Give me something for legs. Brew and drink it 3 times a day. And this - 2 times a day. Mama, I want to drink. Sit here. You'll drink later. Don't pay attention. My wife has died recently. When he sees beautiful women he runs towards them. Nothing left? You are a single father. Take this for free. Thank you. Get well. Thank you very much! Good luck. Take this. Take more. Thank you. Move aside. Let's roll. [Famous Soviet Russian song (1938)] Is it a Russian song? Is it? Yes, it's Russian. Do you like it? What's it about? About the most empyrean love ever. Zhipara! Come on! Now give it to me! - Wait! Give it to me! - Get off! What have you done?! Don't yell! Don't cry. We'll buy another one. I'll never have a helicopter again! Here. There is Uluk. He is three years old here. Do you recall how we used to cut his hair? He was crying, fighting back. My little ones! Asyl, our beauty. She is not Asyl. Her name is Asymay. The other one is Gulzada. - Asyl graduated from school and left home. - Really? Yes. Do you remember uncle Karabas? I mean, Bolot. You don't... Kurmanbek has entered the Polytechnic University. Faculty of Energetics. Your brother is building a house for Kurmanbeck. For two years now. - He has three jobs himself. - Perfect! And I work as a personal driver. This is from him. - This is a good one. - Look at the back side. From the mayor? Did you fool him? No, we don't do that anymore We work as people do. Zhipara takes care of mayor's children at his house. - His children? - Yes. - How do you like the watch? - Good watch. And what's this? It's gold! Very expensive. - Bolot! My son! - Mom! My darling! My boy has grown so much. - How are you, mom? - I'm well. - And how are you? How are you feeling? - Great. - You never come here. - That's not my fault. Take some bread and butter, eat! A lot of working. No time at all. That's right, son. Work! I missed your food! Zhipara feeds you well. And she herself became thin and old... - Look at this watch. - Let me see. It's written here that it's from the mayor and so on. Really? Is it a present from him? - Does it belong to you? - Yes. I've seen Zhipara at the market. Why does she do this stuff? Who? Zhipara shamanizes at the market. Really? It's impossible! I have no clue about it. And this watch - are they stolen? - It's written on it that it's a present! - Enough talk! Do you want to go to prison again? Have you come to put all of us to shame? Give me money and I'll leave. No money for you ever! Get out! Get out of my sight! Bolot! My dear Bolot. Listen to me, son. Stop! Divorce her! Bolot! Where is Zhipara? Where is she? Are you stupid? Told you not to come here! - What did I tell you? - But I've earned some money. - Go to the car quickly! Now! - We had no money! Idiot! Silly woman! Go! I can give you a lift for 500, friend. 500 is too much, friend... Take it and put it on its place. Hello! How are you? Is everything ok? Where are you going? To Papan. Welcome. Get in. - Hello. - Hello. - So, let's go? - Let's go. - So, you are going to the feast? - Yes. Run, Uluk, run! I say - run! Bother it! You must run quickly! And what are you doing? Alright, you'll win next time. Cut, cut, cut! - Everything is prepared so carefully. - All this thanks to my sister. - Your Uluk is so admirable! - God be thanked. Altynbeck? And your daughter is such a beauty! Many men will want her as a wife. Aunt Zhipara is still too young to have such a daughter. I'm just a wife, the younger one. What the fuck? Should we get rid of her? Aysha, go with us! Take it easy, next time we'll finish first. The other one would hang himself to be the first and yours is such a gentleman. God bless him! Hello! Welcome! - How are you, Malik? - I'm fine, thank you. It's not that much of course, but with all my heart! Please. Thank you very much! Mom? This is from Malik. Dear guests, please be seated! Friends, lets drink to a nice meeting! - To the family! - To everything that is good. So, how is it going? Do they get along? They live in complete harmony! I'm telling you as it is. - You are real man! - It's easy! - I could teach you. - My head will be torn off. Kalybek, I don't have money at the moment. Stop it, we don't need anything. You are our guest, that's important. - But with all my heart... - No, no! - Please, give it for your son - Don't refuse a gift. - From mayor? - Yes. Not a common man we've brought with us. Come, come with me. Dear friends! I want to speak to all of you! Do you know who is with us today? The Order of Merit for the Motherland from the mayor of Osh city. This is the present from my friend! Let me put it on you with my own hands! Let your time be endless! Let's congratulate him! That calls for a drink! My dearest friends! Are the first steps of a child one of the greatest events? We become very happy about this, right? That's what our ancestors teach us. Because the first steps are so uncertain. You make a step and then you fall from the nature of the case. But if you've got a family they'll give you a hand, they'll appreciate you and will show you the right way. They'll make you a man. I wish your child to become a real man! Thank you, friend! Brothers! Would you play Kara Jorgo? Great choice! Uluk! Uluk, come here! You shall do like this, you see? Come on! Take all this to the house. Mine got drunk. He doesn't know how to drink. But yours... I mean "and yours" - keeps his chin up. Sure! That's education by aunt Zhipara. Let me finish the game! It's my turn to play, give it back! Aysha, but he is the guest! What's wrong with you? Come to me. Your house is so heartwarming! - You think so? - I wouldn't be able to live like that. - Why? - I need freedom! - You can't be serious! - My blood is boiling inside. Talks still go on? - How do you like my daughter? - Very beautiful and grown up! - You still treat her with sloppy kindness. - For me she's a baby forever. Fireworks! Let's go, come here everybody. Everybody goes for the fireworks! Let's go! What a beauty! I agree! - So, let's have a drink? - No, thanks! What time is it on the mayor's watch? On mayor's watch it's midnight! We have to go, it's late. Aren't you staying? - We'll go... - Thank you, my friend! Have a good trip! Uluk, Zhipara, we are leaving. Take care! Bye, Aysha! Get well, Uluck! So, did you like Aysha? Are you in love? I like all of them: uncle Kalybek and granny. I like all the relatives there - all of them are so kind. We'll see now how the relatives do like uncle Kalybek. Have you stolen it? From uncle Kalybek? No, I've just took it to show you. Give the money back! Give the money back! What a stupid little boy! Hey! Motherfucker! Stop! Uluk! Mama, Mama! It doesn't hurt, Mom. I haven't pissed myself, Mama. - Do you have water? - Yes. - Take it. - Thank you. Mama, are you thirsty? I've brought some water. Here is water. Do you want it? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Let's go, Mom? Two tickets to Osh, please. - What time is the departure? - At 17:40 - One child's ticket and one for the adult. - Ok. For me and for my Mama. Hello. We are at the station. What? - What time will we be there? - At 22:00 - What's happened? - Help! Zhipara, help her! - Karabas! Drive to the hospital. - Do something, I beg you! Drive to the hospital! Uluk, come here! Doctor! Doctor! Bring the stretcher! Faster! Doctor! Help! Get the surgery ready! - Save the child! - Take it away! - What's the chance? - Wait, we'll tell you. Wait here. Everything's going to be alright. Everything will be alright with her. Don't worry. God will help us. Holy spirits of the mountains come down to us, let our sister know what you know in the Heavenly Heights. We're asking you, holy spirits of the mountains, to tell about our sister, what is known to you. Let our sister know, the holy spirits of the Suleiman Mountain. It fell on the left side. Everything's going to be alright. What do you see about me? The road. What kind of road? Who is on it? There are two people on the road. Who are these two? Zhipara, I can't tell your fate. Don't pressure me. How is the Elli? Pump is dead! No problem, we'll buy a new one. Sure, we'll order it from the East Germany. Hello, yes, what's happened? How old is the grandfather? Is it the left or right side of the nose he has a problem with? Wednesday at 15:00. Alright. You see? Here come the orders! Carry this. Let him carry it himself. Sit with me. She killed our child. Dumb you are. You are still alive thanks to Zhipara. Kiss me. You don't love me. Stop, stop! You know what it is? This is pump! Our Elli will fly like a bird from now on! And your children will fly on it! He'd better shove this pump up his ass. Take it, it's your size. I didn't buy anything for you, it's complicated without fitting. Do you like it? Thank you. Hello. How are you, brother? Alright. Where have you been? I've just come back. I was busy. - When will we get the truck? - Soon. I'll fix the pump and give it to you. You will fix the pump? Ok, good luck with the pump. We have to go, they will not get off so easily. There are very few clients, the snow scared them all away. I'll fix the pump and we'll leave. Uluk needs to go to school. And I need to go to the university. Aunt Zhipara, will you let me go? Uluk, look what boots your father gave me. He'd better give the money back to uncle Kalybek. Give me the phone. Work instead of me today. I've got other business. Give me your cell phone! You work first then you'll get it. Ok, I'm a man! I give in. Karabas! Stop at the roadside! Karabas, my beloved, don't quit me! I can't live without you! His parents died when he was four. Where did you get it from? From the orphanage. You'd better haven't come with this. Your whole life is full with her lies! At least she was able to have a baby! How dare you! Bitch. With the most sacred. What's happened? Karabas! - How do you do? - Hello. - At what price you'll take it? - For five. - Let's agree at six. - Ok, if they are fat. Oh, that sounds alright. Ok, six. Sir, they say that you've got a funny name. What is your name? - Bolot. - Bolot?
