[Girl Narrator:] 'Just you wait a little while, the nasty man in black will come, With this little chopper, He'll chop you up, You're dead.' ['dead' echoes] [German] Tell me what you feel. [German] Tell me what you feel! [German] Tell me...what you feel. MURDER-SET-PIECES - Jade, wait up! - Come on, hurry! - I'm coming! - He'll be here any second! Haven't you ever ditched before? Not really. Well, at least we had fun. Yeah, I know. Is your sister's boyfriend cool? - He doesn't say much. - Well, what's he like? I don't know. He's not from around here though. Ah, Shit! He's here! Cool car! I know. - So where are we taking you? - It's just up this way. Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye, Megan. So how was your first day at school, Jade? Fine. Like your teacher? I have more than one, you know? Mmm..so what's your favorite subject? - History. - History? Very good! You see, it's my favorite too. Why do you like to take pictures? - Because pictures never lie. - What does that mean? The frame of a 35mm camera is alive. It lasts for ever. Unlike people. Nothing lasts for ever. What happens to you when you die? I don't know. I guess you just rot away. And you believe that? Yeah, I guess.... Remind me to take your picture sometime. Why? You never take pictures of my sister. Don't worry. I will. Hi Benny! Hi! Well, tell me all about it! I will later. -Now stop that! Go back into that chair! I haven't seen your sister in three months. She's getting to be quite a big girl! - Nah, she's still just a little squirt. - I am not! Seen any cute guys? Well, listen to you miss matchmaker over there! A couple. But they were a little too old for you, Candy. You little shit! - Where's your ride? - He's out parking his car. You mean your ride, don't you Charlotte? You watch your mouth! Charlotte's dating a German prince! - Really? - Yes, I chide you not! Don't be jealous! - Hi, how are you? - Great! I was just talking to Jade about her school. You got to be more careful little girl! Was she complaining? No, not at all. Well, maybe she can tell us all about it over dinner. Oh, not tonight. I have to shoot some girls. - Are theypretty? - Of course they're pretty! - As pretty as me? - Never as pretty as you! [Series of breaths interspersed with ever louder screams] What do you see in him? He's a big klutz who carries around a stupid camera. Jade, stop it! I can't believe you went out and bought a pair of shoes just for him! He's no fun, and he looks at me weird! He's not weird just because he's not from around here and he has different ways. You're always complaining that he's never around and he never returns your calls. Do you know how many guys would love to go out with you? Come on Jade, I don't want to hear now this right now! I don't like the way he talks to you. Why do you love him, he doesn't love you? Then why did he give me a key to his house? It's probably a fake! Listen, I just have a really bad feeling about him, OK? You and your feelings! You know, you're not always right! I am this time! He thinks he's better than everybody else! I mean... look at the way he talks: 'Hi, I am from Germany, and I wear tight pants... and I think I am so cool because I take pictures of naked girls with my stupid camera.' What I am going to do with you, huh? This wine is really good! So Jade, how was school today? There's no school on a Saturday. Of course! Forgive me! I think hard and I work late. It's all right! Do you always eat your meat that bloody? Yes, blood is good! It's good for you. Blood contains iron... and you need iron to replace your blood cells. See, that's the problem with women. Women have an iron deficiency. [Laughs] Among others things. And, women need more iron than men. It's ironic? Women suck blood out of men every day. But at the end of every month? ?it leaks out! It's just punishment. So want some ice cream tonight? That sounds great! I have to use the bathroom first. Where is my sister? In the bathroom. Where you're supposed to be. Last time we talked about your school... you said something about history. Well, this is my history. He was my grandfather. He was a hero, you know. He fought the bad guys during the Second World War. Yeah... but? Wasn't he German? [Sound of engine accelerating] [Sound of win and coins dropping] Boy, aren't you the luck one? - Tell me your name! - Andrea, silly! Of course! -A nice big smile! -OK. Very good! I... You really are very beautiful. Why, thank you! Are you OK? Excuse me...be right back. OK. OK...you promise that you won't say anything? [Sounds of shutter clicking repeatedly] She told Candy that he wouldn't even fuck her. - That's weird! - Yeah, I know! - His grandfather was a Nazi. - A Nazi? A Nazi, like in World War II. Nazis, like Adolf Hitler and Germany and that weird cross thing they had to wear. How do you know that? I saw a picture of him plus, he told me. And when I told Charlotte about it, she said that I was just exaggerating. So, what are you going to do about it? He just freaks me out. Charlotte's never going to listen to me. It's just like that last asshole she went out with. She'll always let guys walk all over her. Well, your sister's smart, she's going to jump in.... Well maybe, but... I just don't see him going away. [Car engine-varying pitch over time] Take your clothes off! [Muffled screams] [Indistiguishable German with woman screaming] [Car engine] You're late! As usual. Man, this hemi has been giving me fits. But then, you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Maybe I'll just find myself a young girl and pimp her out... then I could afford to buy such a car. You don't have a daughter, do you? I don't think so. Can't everybody be as lucky as me. Or as pretty. Let's go in the house. Have a seat. I'll be a minute. Let's go to the bedroom. [In German] It's made in-house in Germany. [In German] Germany will rise again! 500 dollars. American. I'll bet you that old girl in there has already got her panites off. For an extra $500. I'll walk down to 7-11 and buy another 12 pack And drink it there . I gotta shoot some girls tonight. I bet you do! Going to hell is easy... It's getting out that's hard. - Ah, Eh, Ah...You Fucking Bitch! - Please stop! If you fail me, I swear... The whole fucking world is going up in flames! And you are the biggest part of the problem! The biggest fucking problem is you! This is an evil generation! Everyone is so seeking for a sign... but there shall not be given any signs to them! I see the signs, I feel it! Relax, you're going to be in Hell soon enough! Pig! Elephant cage cleaner... well...maybe. Pay or play, Pal! [Under his breath] Jesus, I need another job... General labor.... Septic tank cleaner... What do you need? Some lubrication? Video head cleaners? Blow-up Betties? I got a blow-up Betty over there. Damn, What are you about 6' 2"? I got a nice synthetic doll for you, man, $69.95. That floats your boat? - I'm looking for a snuff film. - A what? - Called ?The Nutbag?. - Excuse me? A snuff film. No, we got all kinds of stuff in here, man, take a look around... you want nude dancers, a lap dance?want some tokens? - I look for a film. [Making fun of accent] - A film? - I'm looking for a snuff film. [Making fun of accent] - A film? Called ?The Nutbag?. Snuff? You mean like: Snuffy, Grumpy, Dopey?? That's the seven dwarves, man. Hello? Ok, fuck off! - I'm looking for something very specific. - You still here? Sorry, if I didn't make myself clear... I don't like to reapeat myself, but I guess I have to... -Uh hah!

Shut Up! {German} Tell me the truth, you fucking cunt! I want to go as a witch. No, that's boring. I want to go as a zombie. That's cool! What time can your sis' drop you off? I don't know if I can. Why? Because she's really upset, and I don't want to leave her alone tonight. - Well, can't she just forget about him? - No. Why? Because he won't go away. [Child's voice] Please Stop! Don't kill me! Leave me alone! ...I See... Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! - I 've seen him! - Please!... This is hard enough without your bullshit! I'm telling you the truth, I've seen him at my school!

He's gone! Now, leave me the fuck alone! I'm scared of him! Try to kick your legs, Babe! - Dad, I got to go to the bathroom. - OK, hold on Baby. Whoa! OK, Sweetheart, you can go. - Don't forget to wash your hands, Honey. - OK. {German} [Recording of Adolph Hitler speech playing] interspersed with [Series of groans as he does push-ups] And [Sirens in background] [Girl Shrieking] [Repeating sounds of Thunder interspersed with his cries] [Television] Police say 10 year-old Megan Wade was last seen late Saturday afternoon As she left her apartment to go Trick-or-Treating with some friends. Police have little to go on, but the Amber alert is in full effect. The gruesome murders of several young girls here in Las Vegas, have been attributed to... You could talk to me, you know. You saw Megan last. She must have told you where she went. She didn't run away. Jade, Honey, please tell me. - Tell you what? - Tell me where she is. She is dead and it's all my fault.
