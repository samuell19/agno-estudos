Let's go, cowboy. Party's over. Well, us is just, uh... We just sitting around getting to know each other here-- the family and I. Are you going to get up yourself, or are we going to have to get you up? No, I...No, I ain't lookin' for no trouble. I'm just... I'm just sitting here... Just having a drink. You can tell us all about it in the morning. Let's go. Now, wait a second, guys. I'll need to pay for damage-- the window and all. Look, I can't go to jail. I got a job. Well, you should have thought about that before you broke the damn window. Eggs is supposed to be yellow. Whatever this shit is on my plate, it ain't eggs. It's eggs. It's how my old lady used to make them. No wonder you shot her. You'd bitch if you were hung with a new rope. You're a fuck. You wouldn't know, sweet shit. You're a goat-smokin' fuck. Ha ha ha ha! Everything set, bishop? Yeah. Good. East gate locked and crosschecked. It used to be you had the convicts-- guys would do their damn time and leave you alone to do yours. Come on, lonny. Not the good old days, not this morning. Well, shit. What have we got now? Inmates, gang boys, drug scum. They'd cut you soon as look at you. Well, they goddamn ruin it for everybody. Ain't that so, ry? Yeah. It ain't half the fun it used to be. Let's go. New fish! Put your eyes back in your head, Billy. None of them's gonna look good in a dress. Fuck you. I ain't lookin' for no punk. The way you've been eyeballin' the livestock, I was beginning to wonder. Hey! Knock it off. Now, get on. North gate, open for the work party. Let's go. Where the hell those guys going? None of your business. Walk. Face forward. Eyes open. Next! Clay treyton, is that you? That's what I thought. It isyou. It's me-- Jimmy latrell. Pondera county jail, three years ago. Jimmy latrell. Yeah. You still owe me 20 bucks. You crashed some party or something. Your sister's wedding! Yeah! You're the black sheep! The family fuck-up! You busted up your new brother-in-law and two other dudes. So what did you do this time, huh? What? Did you waste somebody? I hit a cop. I got two years. No problem. You'll gate in a year. What the hell you in here for? Nothing. I mean, I didn't donothing. Five fuckin' years 'cause some people were looking to get rich without working for it. If I didn't hustle 'em, somebody else would have. Come on! Let's go! I'll see you around. Yeah. I'll be around. Dave, go with Bob. Check the south end. What about the salt lick, ry? Yeah. Check the salt and the heifers, and the rest are with me. O.k. Roll out. I ought to head on over, see if I can get that windmill pumping. Cut across from here. Saves a long ride. Thank you, 471. Head for the windmill. All right, bishop, let's go. Welcome to "c" wing, gentlemen. It will be your home. You will eat, shower, and exercise with your wing. There are three counts a day. Miss a count, you're in the hole. Treyton, cell 18. Stow your gear. Anderson, 20. Move it. You tell jaggs neff to run his drugs someplace else. The next man he sends, only the coyotes will know where he's buried. Now, get off my ranch. Don't come back. This ain't your table, meat. Think about it. I thought you were smarter than that, Weston. Getting in the middle of something that's not your business will get you hurt. Maybe you'd better take your business where I ain't. We'll have to talk about this sometime. You know where to find me. I sure as fuck do... Every tick of the clock. Lockdown. Lights out. Lockdown. Lights out. We're lean and mean. No fat, no waste. Go back and tell them that. Relax, Harlan. Nobody's cutting your funds. Damn sure thinking about it. We're looking at every facility in the state, reporting back to the budget committee. That's all. Bullshit. Come on, Harlan. You know how the game's played. Everybody talks crime tough. Nobody wants to foot the bill. Built this place from the ground up. I won't let politicians nickel and dime it to death. But when I tell my constituents about a convict-run ranch, they don't hear "cost-effective." They hear "country club." Down the road, I've got 1,500 convicts warehoused in my main facility. Most of them have nothing to do. They'll be on the street again-- worse off than when they got here. Now, you tell that to your constituency! Rehabilitation through ranching-- is that what this is, warden? I think we're finished here. Nice, Harlan. You got his vote. Henry, my people... Have worked long and hard. This outfit is as proud and disciplined as any group of men you'll ever see. You got to help me. I'll do what I can. Same as always. Thank you. How much dope was he packing? I don't know anything. Don't talk me dumb, ry. I know you tore up bishop, and I know why. Bishop fell from his horse. If you'd let him deliver, I would have had jaggs with the stuff. See, I was tipped. I was laying for him. Dope don't come in off my ranch. Yourranch? You work here on my say-so, and I don't care how many trophies you have. If you mess with jaggs again, you can kiss the blue skies good-bye. You'll be doing your time on the inside, and on the inside, you're just another fucking con. Oh! Easy. Get out of here. Is that enough, boss? Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. How much seed we got left? 10 alfalfa. 10 alfalfa? Hey, Weston, I've been looking for you. Wanted to say thank you. Clay treyton. Man, I got to tell you something. When I found out who that fella jaggs was, I just about shit. You saved my bacon. I owe you one. Without the bird seed. What do you want? Oh, no, you got me all wrong. I just wanted to say thank you. Good. You said it. There you go. O.k., how about a job? You got a job. Hell, I ain't no sink jockey. I can outcowboy any of those yahoos you got out there. Give me a chance, and I'll show you. I'll think about it. Well, for how long? Give it a rest, kid. Two years I've been stomping around this place. Welcome to my domain. Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. What do you want? Something to eat? Drink? You don't see it, just ask. I don't know what you got going on, latrell, but you got it going pretty damn good. I'm mean, man. Just because I'm off the street, don't mean I'm out of business. I got this place wired. Anything you need, I'm the man can get it for you. Why don't you get me a job out on the ranch? What do you want with that? Ain't nothing out there except cow flop and flies. Beats the sink, don't it? You in the kitchen? Am I in the kitchen? I'm in the kitchen up to my elbows. Ha ha ha! Stretch out, my man. We got some things to talk about. What the hell is horny haimer doing here? Ain't he on vacation? Guess there ain't as many hookers in New Orleans as there used to be. Hey, you old goat-fucker. That shriveled-up thing you call a dick finally fall off... Or what? If it did, I don't miss it. Sorry, ma'am. We thought you was somebody else. That's all right. Who are you? You're ry Weston. Who are you? I'm Maggie sinclair. Fred haimer retired. I bought his practice. I've been a veterinarian for 14 years. I know my business. Nobody said you didn't. Doc haimer was treating one of your mares for distemper-- little sheba. I'm here to follow up. Right this way. Going in the barn. Now, that's a woman. No shit. Got an ass on her, too. No shit. There's no infection. No inflammation. This salve should do it. You can take her off antibiotics and start her on exercise. I already have. This ain't no 4-h club. You shouldn't be here. I thought about that. You ain't thought about it enough. Enough to scare me. Then how come you're here? To see if I can handle it. Keep your head up. Keep walking. I expect your fee is the same as old doc haimer's, 'cause I have to sign off on it. Look at me, not them. What? Oh, yeah. You'll get your, um... Uh, copy of the invoice through the proper channels. What the hell is wrong with you guys? Ain't you ever seen a vet before? You got it? Hurry up. Uh! Oh, we're in the bootlegging business now, man. We're gonna have half the population bumping into walls. You just get me out of here. I'm working on it, all right. I'm not kidding, latrell. You get me out of here. Hey, chill out. A deal's a deal. Saddle your best horse, boss. You got yourself a new hand. I got the papers right here, signed by the warden himself. I pick my own men. You had a vacancy. I got the job. Good thing, too. I was getting sick and tired of sweating over that stinkin' sink. If you aren't too busy... Uh! You could give me a hand. I never seen a posthole one man couldn't dig. Here. Don't waste it. "C" wing. 55 prisoners. All in. Uh! Oh! Here, boy. Watch yourself around that animal. He's a crazy son of a bitch. He looks sound enough. What's wrong with him? Story is, he used to be a pretty good cow pony. Just went sour. Threw some rancher, busted him all to hell. He got a name? Rounder. Rounder, huh? Well, you don't look like such a bad boy to me. Then again, neither do I, and they got me locked up, too, huh? Aw, shit, ry. That boy needs a hand. Sit down, Bobby. We're waiting. Whoa. Whoa. Hey, now, there. Unload it. Get off my back, Weston. You've been busting my balls for three weeks now. I'm not taking any more of your shit. You wanted the job. This is it. You don't like it, quit. Hey, what is it that's eating you? Huh? Is it that I bucked you? Or is it that I'm here without your say-so? Well, come on, old man. Spit it out. I'd like to know just what it is you got against me. You're too slick, kid. You're looking for the easy way. You got no character. You got no spine. Fuck you. You don't know anything about me. I know you and Jimmy latrell are making money off what you stole from Otis. Otis? Ha ha! That stuff didn't cost him anything. It's not like he had to pay for that. Wrong thing to do, kid. That kitchen's his like this ranch is mine. You violate a man's space, you answer for it. When you're through here, I got more for you. Ha ha! Nail him, ry. Whoo! You're slow, boy. You want a fight? Give him one. Teaching that boy a little manners. Oh! Oh! Stay down, son. You ain't winnin' this one today. Ahh! Jesus, kid. Stay down. Get up. I'll give you a hand. I hear you got a problem. Yeah, I got a problem. I got demand to satisfy, neff. I need product. You'll get product as soon as the warden's nose is out of my ass. I thought the ranch was supposed to take care of that, or are you going to let some motherfuckin' cowboy put you out of business? Nobody puts me out of business, and that goes for those fuckin' spics you've been talking to. You buy from me, Sykes, or you don't buy at all. I buy where I can get it. You take care of Weston, we ain't got a problem. Oh! Oh! Better start without him. I want out, latrell. You told me you were going to get me the transfer back to the kitchen over a week ago. I told you, man. I'm working on it. Yeah, while you're tap-dancing around, Weston's out there busting my balls. Hand me that towel. You just get me out of there, you hear me? Look, man. I can't do that. What the hell you talking about-- you can't do that? I owe some people. They want their money. They want you to help. What the hell you trying to pull, latrell? Nothing you can't handle. Hold on now. All I want to do is my time and get out of here. Whatever you all got planned, it's got nothing to do with me. Yeah, it does... If you want to go on living. Oh, shit! Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck this shit! All right, you. Easy. Easy. All right, you son of a bitch. Let's see what you got. Uh! Come here. Come here. What the hell is he trying to do? That horse is going to kill him. It just might. Easy. What the hell do you think you're doing on that horse? I got myself a cow pony. I want the job that goes along with it. Your job is in that mud hole. Get back to it. Hell, you want it that bad, it's yours. You messing with me? Don't mess with me! I said you got the job. You want it or not? Well, hell, yes, I want it. All right, then. All right. You got it. You got it. I'll bust my butt for you. No. I mean that. Lon will get you some boots. I will bust my butt for you. Good. That's good. Son of a bitch. Howdy, warden. Boys. That back of yours been bothering you again? No. I hear you were in to see the doc about it. But it's all right now, hmm? My back's o.K., warden. O.k. Enough to rodeo? I got two months to worry about that. No. You got two weeks. Yeah. Bill renner over at treadmore prison says he found himself a couple of cowboys. Says one of them is as good as you, maybe better. Wants me to bring two bronc riders over to black diamond ranch for a private showdown. Your dogs against his dogs. Ha ha ha! Well, I wouldn't sell it that way to the prison board, but, uh, yeah. Something like that. The back's a funny thing, warden. Can't tell when it might go out on you. Oh, quit bullshitting me, ry. I'm offering you eight seconds on a bucking horse. That's a shot of freedom you can't afford to pass up. We ain't got two bronc riders. We only got me. Well, the treyton boy's supposed to be a good rider. Treyton? Supposed to be hot stuff. He's green as hell. He ain't never been under fire. Green is one thing. Good's another. He's the best you got, and I want him. I sure hope nothing happens in these next couple of weeks to aggravate my condition. Me, too. Aggravation's something we both can do without. Let's go! Git! Get him! Ry, when you get a minute, I'd like to talk to you. That vet likes you. All right. Let it go. You know horses and cows. I know women. She's got an eye for you. You wanted to speak to me? Yeah. I'm concerned about some of these yearlings, ry. They're underweight. So are some of those calves. I noticed that. Mind if I take some blood samples, run a few tests? I don't think they're diseased. I didn't say they were diseased. I'd just like to rule it out. You handle yourself pretty well. That wasn't your first time in a branding pen. No. I was raised on a ranch out near silver bow. And there are times I really miss those days. I know what you mean. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, you know... Forget it. I got over feeling bad a long time ago. Let me know how those tests turn out. Do you know what they get for a saddle like that these days? A damn fortune. And they ain't near as nice as this one's going to be. This one ain't for sale. Oh, it's... It's nice, though. You using that at white river? So what did she have to say? Come on. I mean it doesn't matter what she said anyhow. It's how she looked at you when she said it that counts. How close she stood to you, the way she moved, whether she touched you or not. It's the between-the-lines stuff, ry. There was no between-the-lines stuff. Oh, yes, there was. She's a woman, ain't she? They never come right out and say, "hey, let's do it, cowboy." They can't, right? But, man, they say all other kinds of shit. That's all I'm trying to help you with, is the other shit. You're about as smart as a bagful of hammers, ain't you? No. Listen, listen. If I was you, I'd take her for a trail ride down by cross creek, lay a blanket out. A blanket? Yeah. Look, ry. You could do this. Hell, with your connection with Ferguson, you could make this work. Lay out a blanket... Of course, I wouldn't make my move right away. No. We'd sit in the sun, let the energy build. Oh, man. I'd let that work for me. And then when we started sweating, oh... I'd suggest a swim. Only no suits. "Well, honey, we're going to have to go skinny-dipping." Ry, women get turned on swimming naked. I don't know why, but they do. You just don't get it, do you? I'm a lifer, kid. Can you understand that? Well, man, that's all the more reason to take the opportunity. Look. Man, you can get the hacks to back off, ry. If anyone can do it, you can. Just how long you think I'd survive here if I let a thought like that enter my mind? Just how many seconds would I survive? Weston... Time to go. The good news is there's no disease. The herd is healthy. The bad news is the lab can't tell us why these cows are underweight and the others aren't. Uh, it's probably something they're eating. Might be. We could have some bad grass out there? Larkspur, jimson maybe? Well, I know where they're grazing, so I'll go out and check it out. Why don't I saddle the horses so, doc, y'all can ride out together and look? It's too beautiful to be cooped up inside. I'm sure she has better things to do. No, he's right. It's a beautiful day. It's o.K. With me. I'll get my hat. She went right for that, didn't she? I tell you what-- you play it like I told you, you are going to have one hell of an afternoon. I'll bet you anything on that. Bet you what? I bet y'all find what you're looking for out there. I'll go saddle up this horse for you. Well, if I can get permission, it's o.K. With me. Well, here it is. See? There's larkspur. I was right. Yeah, you were right. Doesn't seem like there's too much of it. You're a good vet. I appreciate a good vet. Getting rid of it shouldn't be a problem. It is so beautiful here. So peaceful. So quiet. Take away the guards, and you'd have a real nice piece of property. Do you ever forget? Sometimes. You know, ry... I've been waiting to see if you'd remember. Remember what? We've met before... At belton, 4th of July. I won at belton 4th of July. It was a long time ago. They still send up them rockets after the show? No. Belton closed down a couple years back. How come you was there? I was with my father. You borrowed his bull rope. Jack sinclair is your daddy? Yeah. That's right. I should have figured that when you told me your name, said you grew up ranching near silver bow. Man, he was one tough bull rider. How the hell is he? He's still tough. Oh, that's good. You tell him hello for me, will you? I sure will. Lots of memories. I'll bet. Winning that gold buckle, riding around in that new convertible, chasing away all them pretty women. Ha ha! You cut one fine figure. Yeah. I was one red-hot cowboy. I know. I spent the whole night staring at you across the dinner table. We had dinner? With my dad and a bunch of other people. We danced, too. I had the biggest damn crush on you. Took me almost a week to get over it. I guess I missed my chance. Last one in tends the horses. Come on! Hank? Hyah! Come on! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! That was close. Nice try. Nice try? I won. Like hell you won. I won. Here's the finish line. Right here. What do you mean right here? I had you by a nose. I started easing up way back there. You didn't ease up nowhere. You saw me ease up way back there, didn't you? See? They're just saying that because you're a woman. Oh, because I'm a woman. O.k. Fine... If you need an excuse, but I won. That's how it goes down in the record. Goes down in the record? Mm-hmm. Nothing like an aggressive woman, huh, ry? So what happened? Down in the record... I won. No. I mean what happened? Come on. What happened? Here. Tend the horse. Oh, come on! Tend the horses. Tend the horses. All right. Keep together now. Well, there's the competition-- Cody stavert. The other guy's cutter. Supposed to be pretty good, too. What I worked out with renner-- it's going to be a team situation. Total points win. He suckered you. Kid's first go-round. Total points is a dumb bet. I didn't bet. Gambling's illegal in this state, but if I had, it would only be dumb if I lose, and we didn't come all this way to lose. You are with the wrong guy. I've never won a damn thing in my whole life. Relax. It ain't coming out of your pocket. Go! 72? Who's judging this-- your relatives? Yeah! Hey, man. Watch where you're going. You want to do something about it? He's got a horse to ride, but I got time. I could have handled it. You're scared, and they smell it. Don't let them get to your head. Who's scared? I am. Fear is what this game is all about. It's what you got to fight every time up. You got the heart to beat it, you just might be a rider. O.k. You're up. Let's go. Easy. Watch your head now. Easy. Easy now. You got any last-minute advice, I suggest you give it to me right now. Don't fall off. Turn his head out. Bear down, Clay. It's yours. Whoo! Good boy! That's it. Jesus, what a shit ride! Hell! You stayed eight on a good horse! Yeah, well, 67 about buries us. You give us a shot. All I ever asked for was a shot. Go, Cody! Show 'em what you got, boy! Come on, Cody! Come on, Cody! Yeah! Whoo! Way to go, Cody. Way to ride! All right! Whoo! All right! Look at that animal! You wore him out, Cody! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Sure enough! Yeah! Boy, is he sweet. I told you he's a rider. You want to see a rider, keep watching. Turn him out now. Ride him, ry! Whoo-hoo! Come on. Stick it to him, ry! Son of a bitch. Ha ha ha! Look at him ride! Way to go, ry! That's it! Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Ha ha ha! You did it! You son of a bitch. I've never seen a goddamn ride like that before in my entire life! We whipped 'em, boys. Pack your gear. We done our day's work. See you at white river, Weston! I'll be there! Get your gear packed up and get back on the bus. Just got to get my halter. Special delivery, treyton, to jaggs neff. You don't deliver, you're a dead man. Single file to the bus. Let's go. Move it. Shame you're not on the circuit, Weston. You could be making a pile. Have a line of women, too. That's a fact. You're as good as the best of them. No way of really knowing, is there? Good ride. Way to go, boys! You're ready for the big time! Uh-uh. You ain't getting away with this. What? That's my seat you're sitting in, son. It's o.K. I'm just fooling with you. Ha ha ha! Winner sits anywhere he wants. Had you going there, Clay, eh? Showed them treadmore punks. That was a good horse. Yeah. He was doing o.K., about three seconds. That wasn't so hard, was it? That's it, jaggs. No more. I'm out. Let him go, jaggs. We had a deal. We're even. Uh! I don't make deals. I own you. We're even when I say we're even. Same goes for you, cowboy. Now, that's a pretty nice loop. It's about the only thing my old man taught me, except fighting and drinking. Well, at least you got the basics. Keep your elbow up. Son of a bitch. Go! Get down! Close to your record! Ho, ho! Good run, ry! This is that red son of a bitch, Bobby. You got it, boss. Oh, that was sweet, huh? Run another one. Hey, I want to go to white river. Don't worry. You're going. No, no. I mean I want to compete. I want you to get me ready for the all-around. You don't want to get on no bull, son. Oh, yes, I do. Well, I tell you what. You got the intelligence for it. So I guess let's see what you're made of. There you go. Well, that's going to happen every time. Wherever you're looking, that's where you'll go. Now get on. Stay over your hand. Keep your chin down. Once again. I want to see daylight under them jeans. Bull riding is done with your legs. Well, surprisingly, that wasn't a bad run. Get on. One more time. Get on. All right. Make it real, or you're wasting my time. Go! Work him! Don't baby him! Chin in! There's your eight seconds right there. Be grateful that son of a bitch don't have horns. Just bring on a live one. When you're ready. Get on... Again. Go. All inmates will return to their cellblocks by 1800 hours. All inmates will return... I heard something I think you ought to know, man. Jaggs has got a shipment coming in. It's got nothing to do with me. Look. It's time to hit it, man. It's time to get the fuck out of here. Look. It ain't no big thing, all right? I get outside the fence on a work crew. You meet me on a horse. We jam to the highway. My wife comes and picks us up, and we're gone! And what happens when we get caught? We ain't gonna get caught. Yeah. Well, I ain't riskin' five years to find out. What you think you doing running that shit for jaggs, man? Huh? How does a dime sound, homey? That's right. 10 years. You don't get it, do you? He's going to work you till you get popped. The last time was the last time. No more. That's it. Uh! Is he hurt? We'll see. Hey, you'll be all right. Don't tell me. I did everything wrong. Well, at least you know that much. He'll live. You know, when it comes right down to it, bulldogging is plain crazy. Maybe we ought to get a doctor. You don't need a doctor. I've sewed plenty of wounds. Of course, mostly on cattle. That figures. What else but a dumb damn cow would let you touch them? Hey, quiet. Just making it worse. I mean, who in their right mind would jump from a running horse onto 700 pounds of steer? Ha ha ha! Just hold it right there. Hold it. I'll get the scissors. There, you're done. Now, get out there, do it right. What--you mean now? You got a rodeo in a month. Hell, I got a hole in my lip. Let's go. Go, go! You're burning daylight. That's some mighty fine stitching. I couldn't have done better myself. What are you doing here? It's my regular visit. You're a week early. No, I'm not. You wanna bet?Yes, you are. How much? See you next week. Uh...hold on, Dr. Sinclair. Maggie. Uh, I treated some pinkeye. Maybe there's some more. Maybe you want to... Check it out. I mean you're here. You might as well. Sure. If you're not too busy. Oh, he is kind of busy right now, doc, getting me ready for the rodeo and all. Well, if today's no good, I can-- oh, today's just fine. You took a nasty spill. You need a rest. No. I'm raring to go. That daylight's burning, ry. If I were you, I'd take it easy. When it comes to your health, you can't be too careful. Ain't it something, the way he looks after me? I'm taking the vet out to check the calves. I don't see any, ry. If there's going to be an outbreak, you'd have seen it by now. They don't seem thirsty. I am. Runs clear, doesn't it? The Cheyenne used to water their horses here. Fought the settlers for all this land. Do you mind if I take a picture? We don't have any more calves. Of you, I mean. It's just something I'd like to have. O.k. All right. O.k. Don't move. Stay right there. I want you right in front of the river. Perfect. Let me take one of you now. O.k. Where do you want me? Uh... Same place, I guess. It's been a long time for me. Maybe you'd show me how it works. It's pretty simple. You just turn this to focus, and you advance there. It's all right. I understand. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-- I understand. I understand. The crush was on the cowboy, not the con. That's not how I think of you. That's what I am. A woman like you don't need a lifer. I don't think of you that way. I don't. I mean, you're an attractive man. I admire you. You're strong and... I don't even know what I'm trying to say. I guess that about covers it. It'll never happen again, I guarantee you. Go! Take him down! Take him down! All right, Clay! Nice ride! Sure was! How was that one? Was that better? If you ain't going to work at it, I ain't going to sit around watching. If you don't want it, what am I doing here? That's it for today! What the hell's wrong with you? While you're getting laid, I'm doing my best. What do you want from me? Don't you ever discuss my private business! Said you wanted to rodeo. All you want to do is run your mouth. I'm tired of it! I'm tired of you! Look, ry, if I said something out there that was wrong-- you're in my light. I didn't say leave. I said you're in my light. Pass me that strap there. Your saddle is almost finished. Good-looking saddle. It ought to be, with all the work you put into it. You're looking for an apology, you ain't going to get it. You ain't my good buddy. I killed a man. Took away his gun and did him cold. Stop trying to make me something I ain't. I heard there was a fight. Yeah, there was a fight. I'd won the all-around at grand forks. Went out to celebrate. A wild-ass cowboy, pocket full of money, looking for some action. I was going to push till I found it. Cut in on a guy on the dance floor. Started dancing with his girl. He threw a punch. I decked him. His buddy come running. I decked him, too. The bouncer grabbed me. I hit him hard. He had a gun. Pulled it. We wrestled. I took it away from him. Hell, that's self-defense. No. He was down. I had the gun. Witnesses were right. I had a choice. Could have stopped it, but I didn't. Didn't then. I don't know if I would now. That's who I am, kid. I ain't proud of it. I don't know what you were like then. I do know what you're like now. You're a good man, ry. You're a good man. Aw, hell you say. Come on in, treyton. Congratulations. He tells me you're Weston's star pupil, that the warden's expecting big things from you at white river. I'm impressed. You got a pen? I'll give you an autograph. Got a package coming tomorrow. You're going to bring it in. No. I can't do that. No? Don't you use that motherfucking word on me, man. Killing me ain't going to get your load in, jaggs. Don't worry. I'm not going to touch you, but your buddy Weston's going to see his last roundup. Tough chasing cows down in the hole. Kill his ass or lockdown. Either way, your boy's going to miss a birthday. O.k. We'll be in touch. Where'd you disappear to after lunch? West pasture to fix some fence. You nervous? Why should I be nervous? I was nervous before my first big rodeo. Yeah, I'm a little nervous, I guess. You'll be fine. You're cutting it close, aren't you, treyton? Let's have it. I ain't got it. Don't fuck with me. Where is it? It's in a safe place. You want a piece of the action, is that it? I got a deal in mind. I don't make deals, you stupid motherfucker! I don't make deals! Yeah, well, that was then. This is now. It's getting a little dry out there. Everybody's getting a little fucking edgy around here, don't you think? You don't deliver now, people are going to go someplace else. They might not come back. That's the way I figure it. What do you want? I get out of here in six weeks. You get half the stuff now. You get half when I gate. But from here on out, it's over. I'm out of it, he's out of it, and Weston's out of it. That's the deal. Take your best shot. 10 minutes. In the boiler room. Let's go. He stays... Until you deliver. He's got balls. You're letting him get away with it? He'll tell us where the rest of it is. Nobody will hear him screaming down there. I'll say good-bye for you. Jaggs is going to kill Clay. He was trying to protect you and me, too. In the boiler room. Get a medic. He won't make it! Where's latrell? I get the product, you get him. Relax. He's back there with stoker. You did good, cowboy. Now let's have the rest of it. Where's latrell? Same place you're gonna be if you don't start talking. Little son of a bitch! There's big money here, Weston. I'll cut you in. Name your number. One-on-one is my number. You and me. Everybody stay where you are! Get 'em up! Get 'em up! I got no weapon! Get him on his feet. I got him. Well, latrell wasn't lying. We have plenty here. Where's latrell? He's dead. He made it to the greenhouse after jaggs shanked him. Here's your weapon right here. Murder one, jaggs. Bought yourself a seat on death row. Get him out of here. This ain't over, asshole. So long, ghost. You're going to die, motherfucker! There's more of that behind the mess hall. In the vent next to the dumpster. Find it. Ry didn't have anything to do with this. I brought it in. I brought it in from black diamond. They said they were going to kill you if I didn't help. This was the easiest way I knew how to get everyone out from under it. It didn't work. I'm sorry. All you had to do was tell me, kid. I didn't have the guts to tell you, not after you trusted me. I'll take what's coming to me. Might be more than you bargained for, son. I wouldn't be too hard on him, warden. He could have took the easy way and got away with it, but he stood up, and you got jaggs neff. That's one way of looking at it. You and me, warden, we're slammed down here together. We're lifers. But the kid's got a shot at something real, if he don't stay caged too long. First time I seen you go to bat for anybody, Weston. I put a lot of work into him. Don't want to see it go to waste. I'll take it all into consideration. Lock these men down. We've got an outstanding rodeo for you today, friends. An interesting match-up in the all-around cowboy competition between Cody stavert from treadmore prison and the current champion, ry Weston, out of brownwood. We'll watch that closely as the day goes on. Right now, let's hear it for our new rodeo queen-- miss crystal lynne tompkins and her court. Hey, now, I knew a girl named crystal. I knew a beauty whose hair was red. Had thighs like peanut butter-- smooth, creamy, and easy to spread. They say, "redhead, redhead, fire in the woodshed." What the hell you talking about? That's right. Welcome to the best of the worst. This is the 22nd tri-state prison rodeo. Now here's a cowpoke we've heard some good things about. In his first rodeo-- Clay treyton. Yeah! Whoo! 6 1/2 seconds for this rookie out of brownwood. Looks like this boy is serious about making a run at all-around cowboy. A lot of these boys have never rodeoed before. We ought to make some noise for them for giving us a good show. 6 seconds flat. Cody stavert ties ry Weston's old record. That was one heck of a run. Whoo! It's official. It's a 5 and 9/10th-second run. A new record for ry Weston, breaking his old Mark by 1/10th of a second. Looks like I got myself another championship, bill. You're not in the money yet, Harlan. In the all-around, third place, newcomer Clay treyton. In second, Cody stavert, right on the heels of our leader-- you guessed it-- ry Weston. Hey, Weston! You were a lucky son of a bitch last time! Today's going to be different! Keep telling yourself that. Might start believing it. Oh! You're off there, son! Hope you have better luck at your parole hearing! My! Oh, my! Oh, my! Look at that boy fly! Next out of chute four-- Clay treyton on a hard-to-ride bronc we call zamaka. Whoo! Stay down! Get him out of there! That's an official ride for a 78. Treyton just made it to the buzzer, and it looks like he's all right after that unbelievable wreck. Let's hear it for this tough cowboy. Now in chute nine, Cody stavert, treadmore. Stavert gets the first 80 score of the day, and he's got a real shot at that gold buckle. All right. This is it. The ride you've been waiting for. This is the convict you've been waiting for. Go to chute number four for the all-around champion of the tri-state prison rodeo-- ry Weston on twister. Aah! What is it? What's wrong? My back. Doc! Get the doc! Bring him over here! Give me a shot, I'll be all right. It's against the rules. You need x-rays. You're all right, ain't you, ry? Never better. He's through. Pack his gear. I ain't going nowhere. Just get me a shot. Want to ride a wheelchair the rest of your life? I ain't going nowhere! I told you it'd be different today. There's going to be a new champion. You son of a bitch! You couldn't carry his boots! Get the hell out of my face! Treyton! I'm going to beat that son of a bitch for you. It's your ride. You earned it. Beat him for yourself. Ah, this is too bad. Because of injury, ry Weston has to withdraw from the competition. That means we'll have a brand-new all-around champion today. I think we should show our appreciation for a great cowboy. You wouldn't be interested in a little wager, now, would you? Stavert against the kid. Straight up on the bull ride. My man gets hurt. He wants to bet. What do you take me for? Treyton boy's a rookie. No. That's what I thought. Unless he's backing Weston, he's gutless. Ha ha ha! You got yourself a bet. You're on. All right, everybody. Get ready for our grand finale. And I'm not talking about no mamma's-boy picnic now. Rodeo's most dangerous event. The toughest eight seconds in sports. This is bull riding. Talk about doing hard time. Ouch! I don't know why that bull's mad at you, Jesse, unless it was him you robbed. With ry Weston out, this ride could determine this year's best all-around cowboy. Coming out of chute nine-- Cody stavert. Get a good ride! Way to go, Cody! Yeah! Son of a bitch didn't make it easy, did he? Well, if you're going to work the circuit, you got to learn to handle the pressure. What'd you just say? You heard me. Don't screw around about something like that. You're green, but you got the instincts, you got the tools. If you got it in here, you can make it out there. I want it. I want it bad. I know the feeling. All right. You're up. Get up. Well, here's our last ride of the day-- a first-year man who's still got a shot at the all-around championship coming out of chute number four, on annihilator--Clay treyton. Turn him loose! Turn him loose! Get him! Shit. Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen. Cody stavert is the new all-around champion. I almost had him, ry. What'd I do wrong? You just got throwed, that's all. I'm sorry. Don't worry, kid. You got it here. Hear me? Yeah. You ain't spitting up blood. That's a good thing. Well, they got us both wrecked up. Hell of a day. You'll be all right. I guess this is it. Guess so. I don't know what to say. Not too much, I hope. Um... You taught me a hell of a lot. Good. I got in touch with the mcshay spread. I got that job. Got room and board. I got six bucks an hour. Hell of a deal. You're only worth three. Here. This is for you. I can't take that. Then you'll be the only pro in the circuit without his own bronc saddle. Oh, forget it. I ain't no pro. Why, 'cause you fell off a bull? Ain't a cowboy out there ain't done the same thing. Treat it right, it'll last you. See you, kid. See you, ry.
