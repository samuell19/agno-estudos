Northern France, 1897 Fantastic. But we do not have the opportunity to feed such a beast right now. Have you talked to Rancy? Ask him, say hello from me. I'm sorry. Georges? Your turn. Don't you have anything else? Yes. I can juggle, I can do acrobatics. Everything... Well ... stop, Georges. Can we be honest with each other? You've had your moments, but this one ... It does not work, no one will see it. What you do is dull, scary. Maybe you make children laugh, but ... - People want something new, something modern. - Something spectacular. Yes, they want value for money. Otherwise, they go somewhere else. - Should I quit, do you mean? - Continue to search. Go now. Almost done. Thanks for the help. Did you get the job? - He didn't decide. It's annoying me, I'm saying no. I understand. With a career like your ... Can I sleep here tonight? They're waiting for me in Paris, I'll sign soon. Of course, it's your home. Delvaux is an idiot. He does not understand what's good anymore. A warm applause for the graceful - And delicious Camille Pantoni! Well, ladies and gentlemen, you are going to see a special representative, - - yes, a sensational one a representative of our race! Come here on a dangerous journey from the great monkeys' land ... ... now we see the missing link between primates and us. Hold the hands of the children hard. Here is the Negro King Kananga! Kananga brings with him Pacha. His loyal male chimpanzee, or female, we do not know. It's not the one you think who speaks our language best. It's the monkey, ladies and gentlemen! Dance! - I see the concern in their eyes! - Is that his skin? - No, it's makeup. - The teeth Kananga has around the neck - - His teeth have been taken from his enemies! Is that a boy? Girl? Do you understand what I'm saying? It's a lady. You do not say "girl" about monkeys. Or what, Pacha? Good night. Good work tonight. Do you like to play cannibal? We sell tickets and I get food in my stomach. It is the least you can ask for. Can you never do anything else? - Why? I like it here. - My name is Georges Footit. Maybe you know me again, I am clown. I'm looking for one like you. - One to another number. - Do you want a negro? - Do you pay more, we can talk. I want a clown that helps me. Are you a clown looking for a clown? - Pacha! He is looking for a clown. - Kananga! That's the end, come on! Everyone can scare children. - Take my place, then. - Now you'll be fine again. We are here every night at nine o'clock And with matinee on sunday! There is room left! Come and see us again, The artists are waiting for you! Come on. Nothing! Don't you know? Are you kidding? He doesn't spend money on anything. - I don't like playing. - You have never bid on a round. - Isn't that right? - Yes. You should pray a prayer, white men. - You lost! - It's best that you give you. - Here! - Quiet, Marval. He knows what he is doing. - You end up completely naked. - As in Africa. We do not play with dice in Africa. We play with white men's legs. - Make up your mind, Kananga. - Play! - Continue without me. - Do not let Pacha play for you next time. - It's not my evening. - You had the wrong player. - You're stubborn. I want to make people laugh. It has been difficult lately. With your help it may change. - Is it well paid to be clown? - Better than being cannibal. - You are called Kananga? - That's what I'm called. "Make me laugh. - Just like that? Yes, come on. Stop, stop. Finish! I have never seen anyone move like that. But you do not exploit it. - It's not possible. - The others laugh. Yes, it's nice, but it doesn't work. You do not create situations. As an audience, I end up outside. I'm bored. Do you understand? That's what's funny. Professionally speaking. Come on. You have to surprise, create a contrast Between that audience expects ... ... and what really happens. Georges! - was it okay? - Yes. Yes. - So you're the white clown. - Yes, and you are bajas, the idiot. They are not on stage simultaneously. But my idea is to bring them together. For the first time, they become a duo. We become two sides of the same thing. Different, but inseparable. Inseparable? United, candy. - You do not have any papers, right? - No. Stay there, I'll take care of it. Rafael! Rafael! Monsieur Kananga! Come on! Balance lyrics, come on! I'm sorry, Georges. Finish. Stop, I said. Georges! I'm not convinced. There is no rhythm. There is no control ... Everything. It's all missing. - You perform with Pacha tonight. - Don't do this. Don't you see how he moves? - If you do not see it, you have to change jobs! - I know I've seen him. - But you two together ... - You need something new! You'll become the first with a clown duo. If it works, it will be a new start! - Théodore, we have wasted enough time. - A chance. Give us a chance. We work, find the rhythm. You have nothing to lose. The audience decides. A big applause for the giant Landon! Little pit Marval! Monsieur and Madame Snake And their offspring! Hercules, who lifts 150 kilos, ladies and gentlemen. And Esmeralda, The thiefest lady in the world! And now, especially for you tonight ... - ... two clowns for the price of one. - Do not take your eyes off - Footit and Kananga Duo. Music, thanks! Monsieur Kananga? Monsieur Kananga? Monsieur Kananga? I'll call you, we're waiting! Monsieur Kananga, come on! Wake. Touch on you. Monsieur Kananga. Please! Please! I heard you the first time! A big round of applause for our world-class act: Footit and Kananga! Georges! We are talking tonight. It made me laugh. - Fantastic! Do as I say, then you'll hear this every night. - What now? - We are waiting. Georges! You can share a caravan with Kananga. - I then? - With Marval. Find a different name. Kananga does not fit into a clown. Think of that, Georges! Does it mean we are in? That means the tiresome begins. I'm a clown! I'm a clown! - You are an artist! - I was suffocated by laughter. Thank you, Camille. - Did you hear that, Footit? Choked. Thank you, Mademoiselle. Camille! Come here! No no! You must react with your entire body! You must receive the ears! Such... All right? - Right. - Bravo! A triumph, ladies and gentlemen, The famous ... ... the bright, the magnificent, Amazing and fabulous - -Footit and Chocolat! What is it? "Romeo and Julie". - Shakespeare. Camille gave it to me. Do you like it? I've just begun. It's difficult. - What's your name? - Gustave. How is it spelled? Like a stake? Thanks. The region there ... and then back to "T". And then a stretch there. There you go. Cho-co-lat. Abrupt! - What's your name really? - Don't you like Chocolat? Well ... why isn't he named Mel or ... Potty? You can not mix flour and chocolate. I must go. If I do not come home Maybe they are looking here. - Yes? I play dice with your brother. Oh, he's worse than Dad. - Don't leave me, I'm freezing. - I must go! The progress is fragile. We have debt to our ears. So be patient. We are waiting for a couple of weeks. Maybe if you pull As many people in spring. You said the same one month ago. And the month before that. - You have doubled the sale. - It's getting better, that's all. - Especially for you. - What do you mean? We've put everything on you: advertising, Posters, every centime ... Let be, Yvonne. He does not understand. I can not give you more money. Even if I wanted to. - Or ... - What? Two, three banknotes for you. Since you're here ... Watch this. We'll finish it up tomorrow. We'll get rid of the old one. Stylish, hey? You could change your name at the same time. "Circus Eat-Dritt", that sounds good. - Circus Eat-Dritt! - Do not talk like a negro. Speak properly. We want seven francs a day. - Pardon? As you please, Delvaux. Otherwise we aren't here tomorrow. Yvonne, Theodore. Are you sure about this? I know what I'm doing. But keep it to yourself, Otherwise it's over. - Are we doing well here? - Don't be stupid, we are worth more. "Circus Eat-Dritt!" - Can you come? - Yes, but I don't have much time. - How did you do that? - I said I couldn't take the horses. There you go. Careful. Like that! Start! We make a small knot! That's how it's closed now. Like that. You're welcome! You're welcome! Monsieur Chocolat! Monsieur Chocolat! I'm becoming a new man. You were not present tonight. - It's because of Camille. - I like Camille. Camille doesn't give us food on the table. We must win the audience every night. The audience marks if we do not give everything. Do you understand? No, I do not understand. I play the idiot, remember? No, she's with the family tonight. But tomorrow ... Come in! My gentlemen. - Can I come in? - Yes of course... When I heard about a duo with a white and A black clown I did not believe my ears. Especially the famous footit. You are not Known for such extremes, Georges. But you impressed me. This is Joseph Oller, Director of the Nouveau Cirque in Paris. Their number is unique, original. And I see many every day. A white clown and a black baja In the same scene, it's smart. - Sit down. - No, I have a suggestion for you. What if you work for me in Paris? A white and a black are brand new, You will be a success. Do you have anything other than what I saw tonight? Something more ... something bolder, maybe? Our audience is demanding, They expect spitakkel. Of course. We always have a number. Some small adjustments only. But we are on track. I want it in Paris, exclusive. What are you saying, Georges? Do not say That I have traveled all the way unnecessarily. What are you saying, Georges? Do not say that he has traveled completely unnecessarily. What does a clown serve in Paris, Joseph? - Can I? - Yes. I suggest this every month, with possibility of extension. Including food and shelter, of course. Gentlemen, Paris is waiting. Good bye. - How much? - Good. Abrupt. Good, good? Paris! Once I have come into place Are you coming We'll see. I promise. I buy nice dresses for you, You will be the queen of paris Watch yourself. Do not say anything and then suddenly, ciao! Take care of yourself too. You are not Monsieur Footit's property. We are inseparable, Mel and I. Two sides of the same thing. - You write well? - Yes of course. - Have it, the artist! - Adjø. - Good trip. - Take us to Paris. - You're not forgetting us? All of Paris is waiting for you. Believe me, you will not come To miss her for a long time. Coal! Who wants coal? I know I'm coming to To love this city. Good day, Monsieur Oller. - How did the test go? - Good. Come with me. I'm careful with punctuality. The show begins at 20:30, 14:30 on Sundays. You must be in the lodge at 20 o'clock every night. At 14 o'clock on Sundays. You do not go out Before Monsieur Fergus pick you up. If you are not ready or missing something Says Monsieur Fergus ifra to me. It will be fined or fired. I know how it is in the country, - - but here I want everybody Greet when the performance is over. Afterwards you go out And talking to the audience. - Good evening. - Good evening. You go to the costume department later. We have no choice tonight, But those costumes do not last longer. Here it is win or disappear, You do not get another chance. You are after the sword joey. It is crowded, 1500 people. I believe in you. I leave you to Monsieur Fergus and walks in about three minutes. Do not do it. See, that's amazing! - There are nice people here. - They finally crash. Hi, Georges. So you're back in the capital? Hi, Ortis. Yes, as you see. - Aren't you going to introduce us? - Chocolat. Ortis and Green, The most famous duo in Paris. At your service. Good luck. Double up, Sundays are never good. Ask the gorilla to calm down! Gentlemen, it's their turn. Is there anyone there? Is there anyone there?! Monsieur Chocolat? So dark it was here. Is there anyone here? Is there anyone there? Are you there? I know there are some there. Monsieur Chocolat? Yes, there are some there. Yes. Yes. I know! - Prosit. - Thanks. Footit! Footit! - Footit! - You scared me. Really? Monsieur Chocolat. You are so handsome. - Oh well? - I'll paint you. Monsieur Footit! IM falling! - Wait! - IM falling! - Do not look down! - It is too late! - Do not move. - Do not touch. You move! Do not move! See! This is... It is... Now it is similar! THEY HAVE EROBRET PARIS LATTER PERSONALIZED USE LATTER! HAT OFF! FOOTIT AND NEGER HIS Be a success in Nouveau Cirque Musée Grevin, 1903 This is Louis Pasteur. In 1885 he discovered the vaccine against rabies. - It's Chocolat! - Paul. Paul returned! - Where is Footit? Do you know where he is? - No, Georges is busy. - He's sorry. - He hates journalists. - Good day. What's your name? - Paul. Paul? Like in North Paul? - What's the next routine? - It's called Wiiliam Tell. A remote Swiss relative. - But much nicer than me. - Did you or Footit write it? Some say you can't. I do not make people laugh either. It meant my former employer, - -Cirkus Delvaux. Do you know them? Madame? Probably not. Since I left them they have gone bankrupt. There are rumors about you Being harassed on the circus. It's just fun, it's like that You socialize on the circus. - Or what, Chocolat? - Just. Come on - Why does not he stay? - He has an educational program ... - Oh well? Rumor also says That you spend money every night. Are not you afraid to lose everything? - When you come from the bottom ... ... you never fall very far. Or what, mademoiselle pedagog? Is not that a lot? - Who cares? - Do not be surprised if you get any reaction. They do not think I have a car. We have to work. In a week we drive Guillaume Tell, you have to practice your lines. - I do not want to break my legs. - If you strive, the audience is with. My audience is already with me. Come on, we go and take a glass. - Why are you never smiling? - I smile inside my head. - You do not like anything. We like different things. Ok, what do you like? I'm listening. You do not like playing or eating. Drinking is okay, but not ladies. What? Do you have a boyfriend? So fun. - Your money, then? - Are you done? You always dress the same. What are you doing with the money? I know it: You're alive A bunch of retired clowns. It is arranged. Come with me. I'll be back in a minute. Do you see it, the star. The Corsican says that we can trust you. Is this enough? - All the Lord wants tonight to stand on me. Are we betting? How long will they take the mane? I put the movie in this box - Then I close here and we are ready. - There he is. - They are on the movies in an hour. And tomorrow, or in ten years, Can you still see them. Soon you will say to your box Can replace the cabaret. No, but it might be interesting An audience who likes innovations. We do what we are going in front of the screen. We can not go outside it. - played? - Lost. Damn handle! It can not be Neither too light nor too dark. - Black on black does not go! - Louis? We are ready. - Take their positions. - Shall we see that way? No, do the number As if it were the audience here. - Forget us. - The device can make a sabla life. You will not notice that later. Give me it... Gentlemen, it's rolling. Start! - It's a real clown number. - Yes. - No no no... - You're out of the carpet. - I'll make up with him. - Who? Ortis? Green? Manetti? Everybody on the circus? Then we lose everything. That's what they want. We have success, it hurts them. - Who's that bothering? I wrote that I should come. Why did not you answer? Have not you even opened them? I have been traveling for two days. I have said That I will never return. What are they going to say? It's not easy for him here. Camille! But! What is this? What is this? What is this? What? No! My apple! Where is my apple? What? What? Where is my apple? I want it now! Now! Now! - Chocolat! - Thanks. - Where is the white clown? - He is there. Are you Footit? - Good day. - We met at the museum. - Mademoiselle Pedagog. - Do you have other children with you? - Yes, but these are fresh. - Where is my apple? - Eugène and Suzanne. - They are mine. - Good day. - Marie Grimaldi. - Nice. - Do not like the danger circus? - Yes, very. But he has gone away. Do you want to play in a hospital? I am a nurse and take care of Sick child. You could give them some pleasure. Brighten up everyday. It's hard to take them ... You have our word, mademoiselle. We are coming. Is not it true, Georges? - Yes, why not? Are you the chocolat clown? Yes, do you want an autograph? - Identity control. - Everyone knows him. - Talk to the circus director. - He is unknown to me. ID papers, thank you. - I have permission to work. - It's enough. He is my partner. - Do you have papers? - Yes. In my wardrobe. He has not. We are checking. If everything looks good, you get him back. - Put handcuffs on him. - Do not even try. It hurts! Where do you lead him? - I'll take care of it. - Do not surrender me. I'll fix it. I'm a clown. Clown Chocolat. Disrobe. Make him white, now. - Do not move! - Stop! Stop! Have you seen? He likes it. Have you. Have you! You see, we tried everything. But a negro is still a negro. Do not think you're anything else. - Give him his clothes. - shut up, Tahitier Haitier, your devil. Oh well. You are the artist who is being fucked in the arse every night by a white man. You will surely get rich enough to laugh. Here you do not laugh at anyone. Sleep, that's the only thing that helps. Has nobody come to pick me up? I perform every night. I perform at Nouveau Cirque. One more, thanks. Thanks. Are you going to go already? We have not gotten to know each other. - I must go. The job ... If you say so then ... what are you doing? Clown. I'm dealing with Greek Roman wrestling. Should I take a grip? - What does one like you do here? Not everyone likes my political ideas. - Are you in prison for that? - you die for it. - Do you know why you're here? - I do not have papers. No identity. - and you allow yourself to live. Your success is an insult to whites. Negroes must know their place. They are going to curve their backs. A negro must be tamed. It was another time. We were not free. Here they make you believe That you are free and equal. The "city of light" is empty talk. Do not expect anything of them. We must defend ourselves, With fists and teeth. We must fight, to the last man. I'm not a soldier, I'm not a war. You reassure the whites. Who gets fucked in the arse every single night. - And you smile when you do it. - I do other things too. Pantomime. I play roles. I'm moving, I'm dancing. - I'm an artist. - There is no artist. An artist pushes boundaries, paves the way. He gets there. - Drop him! - Let me go! - Victor! - Let me go! Victor! Let me go! Where is my apple, Monsieur Chocolat? I feel dirty, Georges. Here. Oller is a guarantor for you. With this you have nothing to fear. He has struggled. They had a week without us. One third less crowd than usual. It was the mother of Delvaux who pointed you out. It's hard, it's hard! - Yes, yes! - Damn it hurts! On one... ...on two... ... on three! Here, taste this. It's better than alcohol. But more expensive. - What is it? - Laudanum. - How much? - Fifty. Careful. - Do you want a girl? - Not today. Stop! We have two new ones, they came this morning. Take for you, boy! Do not have money, then give the place To someone else, my friend. - Is it my friend? - It's getting enough now. I put the car as security. - you have already done that. Shit. Lend me money. We will develop the brand Félix Potin In the country, it would be my father. We have put this together for you. Brilliant, amazing. Very smart pun. This is the first time we have written such a big deal about circus artists. - Your money is safe with us. - I should say that. We set up the poster At kiosks, poster columns ... - You can not avoid them. - Good. Georges? - Good. Very good. - Then we agree. Ignore who accepts the kicks? - Yes, the audience loves it. - I have become a circus animal. - No, listen here ... "Why do I look like that?" Is it me? My face? He is recognizable, not me. We were inspired by Toulouse Lautrec. The usual stereotype. The picture people have of ... people like you. Colored. Monsieur Potin is right. It all happens. It is part of life in public. - You're a celebrity. - If I can't use your photo - -I have no interest in you. One does not say no to such a contract. It's unheard of in the circus world! I kick you every night on stage. You've never complained. - Do you allow? - Of course. What if we do this? Chocolat looks like he will jump for joy. - Yes, it works. - And the contract to Georges? - It stays the same. - Very good. - Georges? - It's obvious not me who decides. Chocolat? Give me a human face. Here, with me! With me! - Can I see your drawing? - It's not for you, it's for him. I was afraid of the reaction. Of your children or your colleagues? Both, Marie. Shall we go? I have come on something for William Tell. I like it here, let me be. That would be great if they can come back. Huge laughter. I'm sure we have something there. - Laughter can not be bad. I have to agree. - I'll come first! - Wait! - Is that your car? - Yes, it is. Suzanne! I usually do that too. You are so clever. The whole staff loves you. I have never seen the professor laugh so much. I love your smile. It lights up your eyes. - Where are the children? - Here you see amazing primitive savages. You can observe them, but we advise you not to go near them. Do you have a coin? - Go down from there. - Why? "Stay close to me," I said. - Do you have a coin? No, certainly not. It took many months To approach and tame them The mission of making them civilized Have just begun. We will not stop here. Come on. Come on, baby. You have signed a contract And will be here on time. What is your excuse today? I am talking to you! We are two. Are you listening? When you're late, I'm late. When you make a mistake, I'm having trouble. And when the salary comes Do you take it twice? For each ad, each image, Do you get twice as much as the negro. How much did you get from Potin? You're not on the poster once. I'm not in because you were offended. You want everything yourself. Your memory is short. Delvaux, Kananga. Who found you when you were ... A wild man! I'm always a negro, Even though I have papers. A nigger that you kick every night. Where is the difference? It's here! Here, here, here! - Look! "Do I blame you all?" Of course! Look at us! The only clown here I am. You only accept strokes. What can you do except that? You do not work, you are lazy! I always manage. But without me are you ... ... nothing, you're done. Monsieur Chocolat! Monsieur Chocolat! You do not let a geisha wait. Come here! Aligato, Chocolat! Monsieur Chocolat! There you go. Come here! Here, here, here ... ...here! Aligato! Hardly! You're an idiot, Monsieur Chocolat. I have not said that often enough. A monkey feels faster than him! Now we bend down! So I can kick you in the back! Further down! Further down! Do not you eat up? What shall I say? Footit is afraid of losing you. Without his helper, favorite sacrifice, He becomes banal. Unbearable banal. You do not understand. When we met he was a big clown. He came up with the idea. He has fought for me. Why are you complaining then? Respect your lord. You have become an expression. You are in the lead. You are Chocolat. I have no master Victor. My father had a lord, not me. "Romeo and Juliet". I have read it three times. I can play it. What do you think? Do not get it bad, But it's not for negatives. - It's bourgeois romance. - But they finally die. Everyone dies in the end. Read this. "Othello". A black devil for some, a maurian prince for others. He fought for the white ones and married one of their daughters. He believes that he has received their respect, but is punished for its naivety. Othello has never been played by a black man in France. Be the first, my friend. Then you are an artist. Then you get respect. Here, try. Trust me. It makes you ... - Strict limits? - Correct. Now everything is about them. The Chinese are Oller's new discoveries. It's exotic. Tomorrow it's fine blacks that generate rain. You have at least shown what you can. You are a good nigger. Is it three to four years you have been beaten every night? And you ask for more. I misjudged you. - You are brave. - Chocolat! Chocolate, stop it! - Stop, Ortis! - Separate them! - Chocolat! - Chocolate, stop! Stop! You broke his nose, But I'm not worried about him. - You have become unpopular with everyone. - I do not care about it. I do not want to play a victim anymore. No more "the stupid fool". I do not want to be the assistant of Footit. - nobody belittles your talent. - What's my name? - What do you mean? My real name, The name I was born with. Do you understand? I want to play theater. I will be taken seriously. What? Do you complain to me now that nobody takes you seriously? How dare you? Did you forget where I found you? Do I make you go out? Who respected you? Who took you seriously? N! They used you as an animal. As your parents were taken advantage of! Remember it before giving me a sermon. Today you have a name, your name is Chocolat. Listen. No black man ever has been as famous as you. You and Footit have revolutionized the circus world. You have changed what people are laughing at. Thanks to you, it's clown comics everywhere. At the cinema, in advertising, in toys ... I have an offers for you from Bon Marché, Michelin, all for business! Do you understand? Do not give up everything for a different idea. People accept you as a clown, For a white man to kick you in the buttocks. I do not know about them accepting you otherwise. They are not ready to see you as an actor. - Now? - Nothing. You were fine. He was, at least, appreciated. - You're a real clown, everybody knows. - Thanks. What happened? - Sorry, it's late ... - Come in. But be quiet, your children are asleep. Sit still. I'm almost done. What if I was alone? - Alone? On stage do you mean? Without Footit? You do not owe him anything. You are free to make your own choices. You are entitled to be very boring if you want. You're messing with me. It is said that you adore to kiss women. There's no connection. You are a nurse. You are the widow of a doctor. And you are beautiful. Beautiful as the day is long. Thanks. - What about the kids? I slept well at their age. How old were you? Eight years. I was with a Spaniard. He had brought me to his mother's farm in Bilbao. - Alone? Without your parents? - They were happy. It was just before the war. I had a chance to leave the country. In the yard the children were violent to me. They were crazy. I fled. I have been a laborer, miner, docker ... A guy discovered me on the street During a fight. I was strong already then. He introduced me to Delvaux. And when I discovered the circus ... I went with everything. Even playing cannibal. It was easy. Madeleine arrived last night. Tuberculosis. We have to isolate her. Hi, Madeleine. Come on, I'll introduce you to someone. It is for you. The married couple Gémier are the parents of little Jeanne, Who is out on the day after tomorrow. - They want to thank you. - Hi, Jeanne. - Hi, Chocolate. - Madame. Good day. I admire your commitment. Artists do not tend to be so selfless. Monsieur Gémier is the chief boss Théâtre Antoine at the Porte Saint-Martin ... - ...for two years. - Soon three. I have said you do not like it at Nouveau Cirque anymore. If you quit it will leave a large void. Marie said that you want to perform in the theater. Did she say that? - Yes, is she wrong? No. No. - What kind of theater? - Shakespeare. Joe, you're really going out hard. - Which Shakespeare piece? - The only one written for a black. It's embarrassing. It's very embarrassing. The role has never been played By a colored actor in France. It has always been played by a white one. - You can be the first. "It would have given the theater some advertising. Shakespeare and I know each other. We like each other, And even share rooms. As for Othello, it's even easier. Who except me in France can you play him with credibility? Monsieur Chocolat! Come and receive the applause! I'll recommend you! Yes, Monsieur Footit! They are not dreaming! Do you see? It works that way too. It's over, Georges. Othello loves Desdemona. But he kills her. They are judged from the beginning. They can not live together in the white world. The piece describes how Othello fails to be like others. Yes absolutely. I agree with you. Do not present me to the others with my clown name. Chocolat is for the circus. My name is Rafael Padilla. - Is that your real name? - I've known it before. - Chocolat is better on the posters. - on the posters too. I want to put Chocolat behind me and be myself. Be it yourself, it was ambitious. - We'll see. - And ... economically ... - How does it work? My friend, here there is no fixed salary. Everybody gets a share. If the audience is flowing you earn a lot, if not ... The theater, or the art of taking chances. Especially when doing something new. But I trust you can fill the theater. Here we have Desdemona. Régina Badet. - Régina? - Firmin. Let me introduce Rafael Padilla. I saw you at Muse Grevin last week. And now you are here, in person. - It's so weird. I hope I'm better than the wax model. He's funny, right? Jules, where had you gone? I was kept by journalists. Thanks. Auriol leaving is a problem. Without you there is no show. You know I cannot refuse you, dear Firmin. I want to introduce our Othello. Rafael, this is our troublemaker. - The fearful, scary Jago. - Nice to meet you. Very "Othello". With you at least the audience won't be cheated. Regina, so nice to see you. The clown Chocolat soon on the Théâtre Antoine! Aviator Lagrange flies for 45 seconds! - Sit down, honey! - Kill me tomorrow! "Let me live tonight! - No. - If you argue ... - Half an hour! No no! You turn your back to the audience. It's not circus, the scene is not round! You have to look at us. Us! And take your hands out of your pockets! - We'll do it again. - Regina, that was good. Come on. Where should we start? But who has loved without wisdom ... - A man... - As... - Fuck! I have nothing in my head! - Calm down. I can never do it. Footit was right. I can only fail. You said you were the only one who can play a credible Othello. Then you stop with you behaving like a little girl! - Do not talk to me like that. - So do not be that way then. We'll start again. Forgive me, my lord. But do not kill me. Your turn. You bite more than you can chew. that's too much. I can't cover all that. Do you have anything left? The boys are coming home with you. Go to hell. Come with me! Stop! Stop, we said! Negro! Where are you? Negro? Monsieur Constantine just wants his money. I can't find him. He sneaked out the other way. Keep walking. We'll get him later. Victor! Victor! Victor! Victor has gone home. - He lives here. - Not home. To Haiti It was best for him. Brothers, love your neighbor. - Always love! - Cheers, Sarah Bernhardt! Nobody knows where he is. - The opening is in two days. - don't worry, he's coming. He always comes back. It's beyond my control. My friends. My mom They don't understand. They make my life impossible. To love a black man is worse than killing. What did you expect? What did you think? I also loved him. I cared for him, pampered him. They looked at me like I was crazy. And for what? To indulge in my career. To rejoice. To make you want. To make theater. - He wanted to change ... - Change what? We had everything. We did what we wanted for the public. I was ready for anything for him. With me he could grow up, become an artist. - That was not what he felt. - I know what you want to tell me. He suffered. But I also suffered. It's not easy to make people laugh. Sometimes when I woke I felt so alone I was going to crack. I cry a tear, and in the evening I was dressed In my beautiful clown suit. Ready for the audience. Whore! Get up! Wake up! I do not want kids to see you in this state. - I'm the son of a dog. - You first and foremost have drunk too much. - I was born as slave, did you know? - Move won't you? Help me now, Raphael. The decision is yours. We can cancel everything. We can say that you are sick, or have been in an accident, we can find something. So, what are we doing? I have killed men in war - - but it's a matter of conscience not commit to murder. I cannot be evil even if it serves my own purposes. - It's better this way. - Don't worry. You have your place here at Emilia. I hold to my offer of friendship. My husband gets no rest. - was it Cassio? - Down on your knee, honey! - Kill me tomorrow, let me live tonight. - If you argue ... - Half an hour! - No mercy. - Give me time for a prayer! It is too late! - Monseigneur! - Who is it? I have done some services for the state. We are not talking about that anymore. I'm just asking you ... ... that when you think back On these unfortunate events - Then describe me as I am. Without hiding anything. But also without hate. You're going to talk about a man ... ... who has loved passionately, But without wisdom. A man not susceptible to jealousy, but once instigated by it, ... ... was pulled along to its outermost limits. by a man whose hand crushed a pearl ... ... far more valuable than his entire clan ... Cheat! Go home! Go back to the circus! - Go back to the circus !! - Go home! What a scandal! - You sponged from us. - I pay. - 11,000 is not no money - I pay! Hold his arms Hold your arms You have three days to pay. Three days! Bordeaux, November 1917 - It's missing a franc. - I know.
