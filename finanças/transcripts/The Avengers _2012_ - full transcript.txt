This is not how I wanted this evening to go. I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me this is better. Who are you working for? Lermentov, yes? Does he think we have to go through him to move our cargo? I thought General Solohob is in charge of the export business. Solohob a bagman, a front. Your outdated information betrays you. The famous Black Widow and she turns out to be simply another pretty face. You really think I'm pretty? Tell Lermentov we don't need him to move the tanks. Tell him he is out. Well... It's for her. You listen carefully Who are you? Get out! There is sickness here! My father's not waking up! He has a fever and he's moaning but his eyes won't open. Slow down. My father... Like them?
