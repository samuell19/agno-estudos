Aw! Yes! Yes! Hello, I'm Bobby Stern. Congratulations. - Thank you very much. - Oh, marvelous. - Spend it well. - Thanks. Enjoy. Hey, Jimmy, what's your game today? Five-card draw. Mr. Kamenev, with all due respect, I told you, no. Oh, but that is unacceptable. Relax, have a drink. I think you should reconsider. This is my casino, and I do not need your help. You needed my help getting in here. Now that you have what you want, you think you can turn your back on me? Are you threatening my daughter? Such a beautiful little girl. It would be shame if she had accident. Ugh! Get the hell out of here! Let's go. All right. Let's go. Come on. Let's go, boys. In. Jack, yeah, this is Bobby. What's wrong? You remember, you once said to call if I ever needed a friend? Well, I'm calling. Aw! Can't we get rid of them? On what grounds, hmm? Loitering in a casino? I can't take this. Stop this. Listen to me. If we give in to them, they will take everything. I don't care about the casino, Bobby. I want out. Is that what you want? Big mistake. There's only one ace left in the deck. Jack Devlin. Harry Eyeball, when did you get out of jail? You shouldn't be here. Really? According to who? Mr. Kamenev. Oh, you're working for that scumbag. Now, tell me something. Uh, do your checks actually clear? Oh! Hey, come on! Jack-- It's good to see ya. Thanks for coming, man. Any time, Bobby. Remember Nicky, don't you? - Hey, Nicky. - Jack. - How you doing? - Hey. Case, you remember Uncle Jack? Yeah, hi, Uncle Jack. Casey, wow, you got big. What happened? Hey, can you teach me that thing you did with the cards? Oh, yeah, sure. Maybe a little later, all right? We have to talk some business. OK. Promise I'll show you later. She has an IQ of 165. I don't know where she gets it from. She already knows how to double down. She's like a sponge, you know? Well, that could be useful. So what's with Kamenev? He wants in on my business. I tell the guy, no, but he doesn't listen. Yeah, but how'd you get mixed up with him? Jack, you know, it's a casino, and I'm not an angel. I've got a history. But he's coming after my little girl, and that's crossing the line. She's our whole world, Jack. We've got to get her out of here. Don't worry. So I bet it on this horse, see? He came in so late, they paid the jockey time and a half. Ba-da boom! Where'd you hear a joke like that? Wait, here's another one. What's black and white and red all over? I'm afraid to guess. A nun in a blender! Ugh, you know, that's awful. Where are you getting this stuff? Cumming, in the showroom lounge. This is Max. Nice to meet you, Max. Daddy says you're the only man in the world he trusts in this situation. He says he's been in many scrapes with you and that there's no better backup in a firefight. Is that true? Welcome to my house. OK, kid, see, I'm gonna check the house, make sure everything is locked. Don't worry about it. There's an armed guard out front and another one on patrol. So guess I'm out of a job then, Max. I'm gonna go get some milk. OK. All right, I'm going upstairs. Won't be a second. OK. Uncle Jack! Drop the gun or she's dead. Let her go. Lose the piece. Let her go. I said, drop it. Don't worry, Case. You got milk. Drop the gun. I mean it. Uncle Jack! Ugh. Uncle Jack. Uncle Jack, what happened? I can't see. Uncle Jack. Here, put me on your back. Get us-- Casey, get us out of here. Where's the door? To the right, to the right. Go to the right. - OK. Wait, wait, stop. Someone's coming. Turn around. We'll go out the back way. Go to the left. - Left? To the left. Watch out for the door. No, no, no, to the right. To the right. OK, go straight. OK, OK. Wait, stop, stop. Left, left. - Left? - Turn left. - Left? Left. Wait, the wall, the wall! OK, turn right. Turn right. No, no, no, watch out, turn right. T-- turn right? Straight. Wait, stop, stop. Roundhouse, 7 o'clock! Look out, 12 o'clock! To the right, to the right! Go to the right! Get down! Oh, no. Uncle Jack. Casey, Casey. Whoa! Agh! Jack. It's OK. Casey? Casey. Hi, Mom. Sweetheart. Are you all right? Are you OK? You were right, Dad. There's no better backup in a firefight. Sweetheart, you're freezing. Jacky, Jack, are you all right, man? I'm OK. How's Casey? She's fine, she's fine. She's alive 'cause of you. Good, 'cause I'm gonna need her help when I go after the rest of 'em. You said on the phone that you had trouble with Percodan. I've been off it 35, no, 36 days. That's good. You were on it because of the injuries you sustained in Atlantic City? Yeah, it was mostly my leg. And the leg doesn't bother you anymore? Off and on. Good, sounds like good progress. Do you mind if I smoke or are you one of those anti-smoking fanatics? Hey, it's your body. Whoa, is that just a cigar? How did you do that? I'm good with my hands. I'm sure you are. How long have you been doing this bodyguard work? About two years, since the Marshals no longer required my services. It's a way to make money doing what I know. So why are you here? Your blouse, is it white? Yes. Would you come here, please? In Atlantic City, after I was hit by this white light, I went into a tunnel. A near-death experience, it's fairly common. But now, when I see white-- Ooh, OK, are you OK? So you feel out of control when you see the color white. Never experienced anything like it in my life. Jack, have you ever heard of a phobia, like, fear of heights, claustrophobia? Sure, but to the color white? Color phobias are actually fairly common as far as phobias go. Never been afraid in my life. It's not that you're afraid that the color white is going to hurt you or kill you. But-- --you are afraid of something that the white represents. I'm not sure I follow. OK, for example, a person may have a phobia of knives. That doesn't mean they're afraid every knife they see is going to stab them. They might be afraid that they're going to lose control and stab someone else. OK. The color white represents something to your subconscious that you are afraid of. Now, we're gonna take this one step at a time. The good news is is that most phobias are curable. So what do I do for now? Keep your glasses on and keep your appointments. I see you in a couple of days. Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Come on! Cinder! Honey, will you get me some more champagne, please? Sure, sweetheart. Dorothy, honey, what's wrong? Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Walk me into your temple. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. I walk into your temple. All right, ladies, keep it moving. Come on, let's go. Come on. Oh well, come on, ,, as she washes out in the hot lights. Hey there. How long is she gonna be out there? Six outfits, half an hour. You said you've got the place secure. We just got another one delivered by a messenger. Well, what about the messenger service? Guy came in, paid cash, nondescript, no prints. She needs to know. Absolutely not. It's her New York debut. The Vencini announcement's on Friday. I don't want to spook her. You don't want to get her killed either. This guy is a psychopath. That's why I hired you people. Look, we've locked the perimeter. It's a hardened site. Threat is minimal. I'm telling you, it's too risky. OK, baby, time to rock and roll, right? Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. I want into the temple, the temple, the temple. The best cup of Colombia Supreme homemade by any human being in the history of the city of New York, made especially for you, my friend. There you go. Thanks, Thomas. Eh, yeah? Someone's here to see Jack. Who is it? A lovely young lady. Ah, well then, you know, send her-- wait a minute. Is she wearing white? No, just kidding. All right, send her up. Uh, Mr. Jack Devlin. Yeah? Uncle Jack. Casey, ah, mmm, oh, it's so great to see you again. Casey, hey, what's the matter, sweetie? My name is Mark Smoot. I'm here at the bequest of Bobby Stern. I'm his attorney. We have some serious business to talk about. Oh, what's the-- In private would be best. Sure. Hey, Casey, hey, I want you to meet my friend, the pirate, one eye and everything. Casey, Max, meet Thomas the Pirate. How do you do? Hello. All right, come with me now. You don't look like much of a pirate to me. Yeah, well, looks don't make the pirate. It's the ugly things we do. That's what makes the pirate. When was the accident? The accident was a week ago. I know that it's not much consolation, but, uh, neither Bobby or Nicky suffered. It was immediate. Casey's spirits really lifted when she heard we were coming here. She told me all about you. How is she taking it? Well, sir, I must say, pretty well. I guess I don't have any choice, do I? It's what Bobby wanted. And from what Casey tells me, I am sure you are going to make a fine father. So what should we do? Want to play a game or something, like chess, perhaps? I warn you, I-- I take it very seriously though. Ah, chess? I don't want to do anything. Well, you know, I'm an expert at that too-- --doing nothing. But then, you know, how do we determine a winner if we're just going to sit around and do-- Hey, Casey, hey, what do you think of my place, huh? It's OK. OK? It sucks. Hey, you know, I've got satellite TV. Thomas will cook you something. Hey, no, now, see, I don't cook. I create. And once you have tasted what I create, never will you want to leave us. Never, promise. Echo 25 to base. This is rooftop. The package is in the lobby. Copy, Echo. Perimeter is secure. They insisted she be there. That's-- yeah, I know. Well, listen, apparently, there's some sort of a security-- OK, listen up. We're changing frequencies every 12 hours. If you see anything with ID, ping us. Now this woman is about to receive a $6 million contract, gentlemen. So remember, dead clients don't pay. Well, they can sod off. Yeah, because at-- At 10 grand a day for 25 men, they better be bloody good. Yes, right, Donald Tragle. He did Secret Service for George Bush, did Michael Jackson's last tour. What, Cinder? Are you serious? She's a rock. They know she loves the attention. Rehearsal's this afternoon. Yeah, we'll make the announcement. All right, ciao. Oh, bloody clients. Why'd you lie to 'em? It's an advertising agency, darling. They expect me to lie. Look, baby, I'm on this, all right? We got wall-to-wall men outside. That's great, but why haven't you told the police about the notes and the calls? Oh, and have all the bloody tabloids down in the lobby? No, thank you. As far as the press knows, this is just some random wanker firing at the show. I just wish this was over. Would you relax? Look, come Friday, you're going to be on the Concorde to Paris. This wacko is just after the next "Cosmo" girl. That's it. Police can't find the slug. It's disintegrated. This guy's a real pro. Maybe he just has access to professional equipment. I think you should call off the rehearsal until we can sweep the adjacent buildings. Canceling the rehearsal is not exactly an option. We had a recon team downtown since 10:30. Reconned? Like you did the other day? All I know is this guy can hit from 10 blocks away. How are you going to secure that? So you are with him all the time now. During the day mostly. I don't sleep with him. So, pick a card-- sign it. And the color white really makes you feel bad? Yeah, It's called a phobia. OK, put it back. So, now, I'm going to make your card appear in my wallet where I get to keep all this cash. I only think of good things when I see white-- like clouds-- big, fluffy clouds and bunny rabbits. Popcorn is kind of wet, isn't it? And there's always sugar-- or snow-- or angels and heaven. I miss them too, Casey. You'll see why again, Uncle Jack. I'll help you. OK. Deal? All right, now, ready for your guard. Yep. OK, now, your card is in my wallet. Sorry, Uncle Jack. Wait a second-- I said in my wallet, right? Yeah. Let's have a look in here. What is that? Wow! How'd you do that? Magic. Yeah? Yo Jack. Jim? Let's do lunch. How is the babysitting business, boss? Got a boy-- not as much fun since you left, Jack. How long did it last with you? What? About a month after we left the Marshals? Ha, why don't you try two weeks? You ever miss being a Fed? We spent more time fighting the bureaucracy than we did fighting the criminals. You remember that. You said they'd have to carry you out. Yeah, well, things change, Jack. You didn't have to quit over me. Who said that? I quit because I got tired of going out for scungille at 2:00 AM in the morning. OK. So what's this about? Name is Cinder James. Some head hunter from Elite found her waiting tables in Little Rock. This girl just signed a $6 million contract with Vencini Jewelers. What kind of girl? Somebody is trying to cancel her contract. And they are using vanishing loads. Who have you got on it? - Don Tragle. - Ah. I know. I know. Vencini was impressed with his, uh, resume. Well, just what your back. The Secret Service agents are spoiled-- three-hour shift changes, White House food, autographed pictures of the first lady. Well, that's why I'm here. This sniper-- he operates like a real pro. Tragle is way over his head. You sure you don't want to join me on this? I'm a new father-- 4 feet, 76 pounds of bouncing baby girl. I got to find a dentist, buy a bunk bed, set up a carpool, meet the neighbors kids, and hire a piano teacher. My hands are full. Good luck, Jack. There's nothing harder than being a good father. Yeah. Hey, thanks. See you. Come on now. Hold it. I'd like to use a stand in for a rehearsal. Ah, sorry, no. Vencini insisted on Cinder. They need proofs of the money shot before Friday. Let's have a talk. This club has got 16-foot windows. We put her in a fixed position for more than an hour. We might as well write her name on the bullet. He said he could guarantee it. He said what? Every building in range has been locked down. We got six units of NYPD. You brought this job in. But let's get one thing straight-- this is my company. It's also the biggest contract you ever had. They didn't hire Prototel. They hired me. So relax. Fine. She goes down-- you go down. Excuse me, are you a bellboy? Let them through. Not here, from the other side. Get out of the way here. Come on! Coming through. Hey, moving through. Come on. Moving. Get out of the way. Let her through. Move aside. Move. Yes, move. Come on. Through the door. Move! Move back. Move. Come on. Just through the door. Get down, sir. There he is! Get him! Get the shooter! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Civilians! Get out of the way! Add 1,000 milligrams of ampicillin to Mr. Hasting's IV stat. Yes, sir. Sorry, this is limited access. I am here to see Tim Hastings. Lieutenant? It's OK. I'll vouch for him. Hey, Trini, how are you doing? Sorry about your friend. We've got two dead from the apartment where this guy took his first shot, if it's the same guy. I'm just here for Tim. If you say so. When he first left the Marshals, he thought by starting his own company, he'd finally be able to protect the good ones. Connie, listen-- No, listen, this is all he's got right now, Jack. The business-- do you understand? He trusts you, Jack. I know, but right now, I'm retired. If that girl goes down, the business is done. Is that what you want him to wake up to? Connie, Tim came to me. And it's kind of hard to explain, but I have a problem with my vision right now. I just don't feel ready. Devlin, what the hell are you doing in here? This is none of your business. I can handle this. The question is-- what are you doing here? I have some business with Hastings. What? I just need a signature. The doctor said he was semi-conscious. What happened? The IV broke. Potassium-- that would have killed him. Call Trini. He needs more protection. Got it. I'm in. Drugs are bad for you. Did you know that? Can you walk? No, I can't-- I can't walk. Oh! Let's go. Come on! I want to get something straight, mister. Devlin. Jack Devlin. Well, don't think you're going to be able to come barging in on me whenever you want. As far as I'm concerned, you're the hired help. You're paid to do what I say. Really? My friend takes your bullet, and you want to talk to me about who's getting paid? How is he? He's in a coma. I'm just here to help them finish the job. I'm so sorry. No need to be sorry. In our business, we're always ready to take a bullet. I just want to make sure I didn't take it for nothing. Now, listen, Cinder, we need to work together. I'll do my job, but you got to take care of yourself. You got it? OK. Got all your stuff now? Yeah, I guess so. Good, because we're moving. OK, our next plan-- Don, please, can you give us a few minutes? Sure. Deploy the perimeter. So is it true you're not getting paid for this? Pro bono. Hold still. Lumbar vertebrae, right? I want arms up-- palms touching the wall. What is this? Trust me, you'll like it. Oh, no, there's a disk problem. Hold still. What are you doing? Finding your center. OK, take a deep breath. Hold it-- three, two, one-- Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! The pain is gone. Well, for an hour or so. But I'll be back by then. Do you have to leave now? Look, there are two ways to bodyguard. You hide in a box like this and wait for the threat to come. Or you go out, and find it, and stop it. I'm a type A personality. I hate to wait. Yeah. Honey, I'm sick. I need my medicine. No way, baby, we've been over this. Just till Friday. Where is he keeping you, baby? - A - hotel in Dobbs Ferry, the Hillcrest Bungalow 6. All right, I'll be there. An hour ago when you said that you would be home, this was terrine of braised veal Caprese. Now, it is protein on a plate. Bon appetit. I'm sorry, Thomas. I've been talking to Trini. This guy fired from a block away. Mhm. The bullet went through half an inch of glass-- Aha. A vase penetrated 2 inches into a wall and then disappeared. Mhm. Well, to have that much power, it must be an H&K. Huh? Or maybe the projectile was-- carved ice or something. Now, I want you to talk to a couple of your buddies in the Bodameinhov gang and find out who is using them. My buddies, yeah, if I can get through to them, if they even have a phone. You takea my space. I breaka you face. Welcome to Little Italy. Isn't it great? Yeah. Thomas said I ran him ragged and that he'd rather be sucking sand in Morocco. It's true. Good? - Great. - What are you doing? Got to go. Huh? You forgot? You know, you don't live alone anymore. Hey, Casey, I'm sorry. Say, um, I'm still kind of new at this-- this uncle thing, and um, this friend of mine got hurt this afternoon. And he really needs my help. You're not going to get hurt, are you, Uncle Jack? Yeah? Devlin residence. Yes, he is. Big shot. For you. Yeah? Jack, it's Dr. Stein. You're half an hour late for your session. Are you still coming? Oh, no, I'm sorry. Something came up. Something good, I hope. Not really. A friend of mine asked me to do a job. What kind of job? Protection. Cinder James, the supermodel. Sounds dangerous. Do you think you're ready? He needs my help. OK, I understand that. But Jack, you need to realize that your sunglasses are the only protection you have from all the white out there. Thanks for the vote of confidence. Be careful. Hey, Thomas, why don't you send her two dozen something? Orchids. Most women love them. Orchids. Two dozen orchids. Why don't you just buy her a Mercedes and get it over with? Oh, yes, find two dozens orchids. I'll go to the bank. We'll get orchids. Casey, listen, I won't be gone too long, OK? We'll do something when I get back, all right? - OK. - OK. A man came by a few minutes ago and left this. Thanks. Put him on. - Are you serious? What is this? She's had a visitor. We've been blown. You-- find some heels and a dress. You better grab a ballistic blanket, because you are the decoy. Do I need to shave? Now you know why they pay us so much. All right, listen up. It's a three-car formation. Cinders and Chase with me. He'll think she's in the stretch. You'll ride lead. If there's any fire, you'll break with the limo and take off. I'll reverse, and we'll link on the parkway. Let's roll. Come on. Let's go. Watch your step. Come on. Let's go. Oh! Get down! Go! Get back! Hey, sit down! Come on! No, Cinder, stay down. Well, well. Looking for these. Huh? You're a disgrace. What's the matter with your eyes, Jack? Huh? Is it this? Huh? It's white, isn't it? You're afraid of the color white. I'm lactose intolerant. You think this is funny? You think I'm funny? You think you're going to protect Cinder from me? You don't even have the depth to understand her. I'm protecting her, not you, huh? You have never seen her so in pain she can't stand. That one, I have seen. How can you protect her from me when all I want to do is love her? Go! Get up there! Go! What the hell happened to you? I went swimming. Thanks for helping me out. Take care. Goodnight. Jack. Getting some more of these? The address is on the label. And Dr. Feelgood ought to be more careful. Yeah, I'll be sure to tell him. It starts with the shivers-- then the cold shakes. I know what you're going through. I was a user once too. It's powerful stuff, but not worth dying for. Save it for someone who cares. If I can find you, so can your friend with a rifle. I'll take my chances. All right, suit yourself. Take enough of that junk, and maybe when your friends bullet rips the back of your head off, you won't even notice. All right, Cinder, let's have the goodies. What about your backup? I don't know what you're talking about. You're a junkie, sweetheart. You're leaving for Paris. You would have asked for a little extra. I don't have to put up with this. No, you don't. But it's my way or the highway, you got it? You know, you're a real wet blanket. Hey, just think-- if somebody would have done this for Elvis, he'd still be doing tacky lounge shows and in Vegas. Go ahead. How much were you using? 325-- for a day. Well, that's determination. This is Jack. Can you come to my place? Oh, god, OK, what's going on? Who is that? The model? Dr. Stein is on the way. She looks, uh, sick. All right, get her warm. Good. There you go. This is my friend, Thomas. Hello. Ah, you're in good hands now. You'll be all right. Is this your girlfriend, Uncle Jack? No. She's very sick. You'll be OK. This is Max. I'm Casey. Hi, Casey. Ah. D-- Dr. Stein? OK, where's the fire? Ah. Down here. This had better be good. Thanks for coming. This way. Is this your girlfriend, Uncle Jack? No, honey. I'm his doctor. You must be Casey. - Uh-huh. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. And this Jack is part of the work you're doing. She's coming down off a Percodan habit of $1,300 a day. Think you can help? Yeah, but first I need to get her out of those clothes and back into bed. Casey, would you give me a hand? Sure. I think we girls can handle this. Why don't you boys go and make yourselves useful by boiling some water or something? I don't like being patronized and dismissed. Thanks for coming, Dr. Stein. My pleasure. And you can call me Rachel. By the way, I was on a date at the test center and I'm billing you for this house call. Absolutely. Thank you for the flowers. What did I do before you came? Probably made a lot of ladies mad. Tell me about Jack. His father was a gambler. He had a photographic memory. He was one of the first card counters in Vegas. And his mother-- ah, his mother-- well, one night, she ran off with a guitar player. He never saw her again. Really? That's awful. No, what was awful was that guitar player couldn't play a note. And after that, Jack and his father-- they hit the road in a 1962 white caddy. He went from town to town, you know, because he was always winning. He was black booked in all the casinos. So they would hit Atlantic City and the Bahamas. Whenever the house got wise to him, the father had a signal. He would flick his light at once, twice, and that was the signal for Jack to go get the caddy ready. One night, that lighter-- it didn't work. So Jack missed his cue. What happened? Some mob guys-- they grabbed him before he left. They found the body in the desert. That's horrible. And after he buried his father, and he paid off all his markers. All that was left was that lighter-- an old Zippo. So how'd he get to New York? Ah, well, his grandmother was here-- came to live with her. You know, she was a very nice lady. She cleaned houses. She's the one who gave him his code that he lives by. And what's that? He is slow to make a promise. But he's quick to keep it. Is this the DMV? My name is Rory Gaines, and I'm stuck out here in a rental place in New York City. You know how unfriendly the people are in New York City. I know. Anyway, so someone pilfered my wallet, and I've lost my damn driver's license. So I was wondering if you could fax me a copy so I could rent a car and drive to a police station and report this. You are too kind. I just wish I was home. Anything on those vanishing rounds? Yes. It looks like it's a CD-- a Controlled Disintegration device. It explodes on impact. It's impossible to trace the origins. Well, who makes them? Mhm. Well, my friends at Baader-Meinof that-- Oh, you got through? Oh, yeah, you have no idea. Don't ask. Anyway, they told me there's a guy on Long Island. His name is Ghide Sinno. This man apparently is an expert in weapons technology. And if the price is right, he's also into teaching. Well, if it is who I think, this guy has got plenty of cash. Yeah, where are you going? You know it's late. You have to get some sleep. I can't. This guy spilled milk on me. Cinder? We have to talk. - Why? What's wrong? You've been holding back. No, that's not true. Well, I just checked your bank account. You've been wiring money to Arkansas-- thousands of dollars. It's for my sister. She's dead. She died in a bus wreck in '89. That's how you hurt your back. There's no time for that now. Come on. This guy knows you. He's obsessed. Now, I can't protect you if I don't know the truth. Jenny was the one that was supposed to be here, not me. It's all she ever wanted. She took tap. She went to beauty school. She even starved herself till she was sick. That's what this is all about? You doing all this for your sister. Oh, at first maybe. But then I found out I was good at it. I've never been good at anything in my life. And now I'm this close to making it. I'm scared. Cinder. Jack, I have a tummy ache. What did you have for dinner? Pizza, licorice, cream soda, and pickles. Thomas let you eat that. No, we ordered out. No wonder you are sick. Cinder? Here. OK. All right. OK, I am going to have to go in that. Yeah, go get her. OK. I love-- I love you. Cinder. I love-- I love you. You and I aren't meant to be together. So kill me if you want. Jack. JACK Come on, Cinder. Let's get in the car. Who are you running from? What do you care? Obviously, you're just doing your job. What first? Now. What? I just don't want to see you get hurt. Is that all? What do you want from me? The truth. If you think you can run away from shadows your whole life, you're wrong. - No, no, I just-- Come on, Cinder. You know who the shooter is, don't you? Yes. It's my ex-husband. Do thou but close our hands in holy words. I say there will be no more marriages. And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover-- oh, my fond love thus do I blow to heaven. Oh, love, thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate! Swell bosom with they fraught. For 'tis of aspics tongues. Oh, blood! Blood! Rory Gaines married Cinder when she was 16. What? The supermodel? She's your client? Christ, Jack. They just fall into your lap, don't they? The guy is Caucasian-- 6' 4", 200 pounds, no criminal record. The word on the street says he's been training with weapons. This guy's a failed actor gone haywire. He's a basic obsessed, wife-beating ex-husband. The guy is complete letters, stalking, blackmail, and murder. Blackmail? The guy was an actor. He couldn't get a job. His wife made it big. She paid him off for the divorce-- couldn't pay him enough to get lost. Then Vencini makes the announcement. So Rory figured if he couldn't have her, no one could. No where to find him? Soon. Well, I could put out an APB on him. Talk to Vincini. Make sure they call off the show until we nail this guy. I'll try my best. What does this mean? It means she stays inside, under guard, 24 hours a day until we get him. The announcement is tomorrow. If Vencini finds out, they'll drop her in a second. You haven't told them yet? That's why Tragle is still on the job? You two cut a deal. I'm protecting my client. We're surrounded by 40-story buildings. He has 1,000 places to hide. This guy could be anywhere. I'm telling you she'll be nowhere if she doesn't make this deal. You say you're good at damage control? Just trust me. Devlin is history. How much is this going to cost? There's an outstanding loan at Prototel that has come due. At the moment, the company hasn't any value. With a partner that's liquid, I can take it. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, buddy. Deal. Where are you going? I'm going to see the weapons guy. Now, how were you planning to get the information out of him? You are going to use a weapon? Yeah, you are going to intimidate him. That's very boring, you know, Jack. Well, what are you going to do? Talk him to death? Perhaps. This area is closed to the public. Ah, that's why the door was locked, eh? You have to leave at once. This guy-- ever seen him before? Get out of here. Get the hell out of here. Listen to me,.. You don't want to know who I am. You don't want to know why I'm here. So. And I tell you right now, you don't want to meet my family-- mi familia. You understand what I said to you? Ah, he's going to be nice now. He's understanding. We know you are the best manufacturer of customized ammunition. We know you helped this guy. Look, I am an immigrant. I just got my green card. I don't need help. Oh, we don't care about you. Oh, we don't care about immigration. We just want to get this guy off the street. That's it. He ordered a couple of things. And, uh-- And what? And gave me a telephone number where I can reach him just in case. This is uh-- Good luck. And, uh, congratulations for your green card. Thank you. That's very nice. Good. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. - 555. - 555. 0199. 0199. What time do we have to pick up Casey from school? In about an hour. We're not going to make it, you know? We're going to be late. - Well, somebody has to. Well, it's not going to be me, obviously. I'm working here. What is that high-priced psychiatrist of yours doing besides screwing up your head and taking your money, huh? Why don't you have her do something? - Well, that's a good idea. - Of course it's a good idea. All right, here's this. Look, look, look. 800 West 45th Street. You know what that is? That's the distillery building. The Aramore Distillery right off Times Square. OK, let's get out of here. Let's go. All right? Hi, Rachel. Are you busy? He's on his way. And he's got a friend with him. Thomas? Thomas, you all right? Yeah, listen, you think next time you can aim a little higher? The guy is taller than me by about a foot. I'm sorry, pal. Ah, ah! I haven't had an audience in so long. One of these heads is not like the other. Where-- is-- Thomas? You don't have to do this. Where-- is-- Thomas? Please, stop. Come on, Rory. You know you've won already. Come on, Jack. Come on! You're better than me. Stronger. Where's Thomas? Whatever you want, I'll give it to you-- anything. Anything you want-- just stop! You know what you are? You're nothing-- nothing to nobody. Nobody hears you. Nobody sees you. What gives you the right to look down on me? You don't know how I feel. You've never been a nobody! You've never been ignored! You've never been humiliated on stage. Where-- is-- Thomas! Where is Thomas? Where? You tell me! Where? Where is he? Here is Thomas, you bastard. You haven't lived the years of rejection-- been deserted by everyone. Anyone I cared about betrayed me. Oh, my god. My face. You're dead, Jack. Die and be damned, Jack! oh, Thomas. Thomas. Oh. You OK? I-- I've never been better. How about you? Not too good. Yeah, well, you need more therapy, you know, that's the problem. Rachel, this white thing-- I've got to get past it. You have to give me something-- a devise, technique, to break this thing. Because if I don't beat it, they'll kill her. I don't know if this will help, but my philosophy teacher used to say, it is written-- there's a time and a place when we all have to go. I'm not afraid to die. But you are afraid of losing control. And you feel responsible for your father's death and the attack on Casey. I was responsible. You had no control over either event. You're not at fault. But yet, the lighter was set. I should've known he was trying to signal me-- even without the flames. Jack, it was your father's time. What this is about is understanding that you can't do it all. All you can do when the moment comes is your best. My best. Can't sleep. It's OK to cry, you see? It's OK. I cry a lot at night. I miss them. I cry sometimes. I lost my parents when I was young too. But every day, I looked up, and I know they're watching from heaven. Wow! Really? Does that mean mommy saw me take the candy out of the dish on the coffee table? That was you. I'm sorry. Max was hungry. Yeah, Max is like that. You know, you can't always listen to him. You can listen to this-- and this. OK. I love you, Casey. I love you too, Uncle Jack. 22 Bravo to Echo. Clear for pick up. Cinder. Don't go. - Jack, come on. I'll be on a plane in six hours. Do you think this guy will stop? If he doesn't do it-- Relax. The window is all covered in Mylar, so he won't have a shot. Now, let's ride. Jack. I can't spend my life hiding. Wish me luck. This is the business-- like it or not. I just got it. You got a policy on her, right? Life insurance. - Of course I do. Run of the contract. So she's worth the same-- dead or alive. Take it easy. Take it easy. - See this? Hmm? See this? It's a note on the company. I just took control, and you're fired. Hey, hey! What's going on? Hey, stop worrying. You got twice the amount of men that Reagan had the day he got shot. That's reassuring. This place is locked. Yeah, that's why they call it the vault then. I guess if I'm going to go, I might as well do it in diamonds. Sorry. It's a closed event. Hey, don't be such a jerk, all right? He has no jurisdiction here. He's not NYPD. He's not Prototel. Easy. He was here. I know he's here. Take care then, OK? And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment we've all been waiting for. I give you the Vencini face of the '90s-- the spectacular Cinder James. Up there! NYPD. Drop the weapon. Everybody back up. Put your guns down. Come on. He's gone. You screw up everything. Oh! You sure it was him? One last dance. Lips. Oh, you the doors of breath. Seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death. I know I'm going to die. I don't care anymore. You say you love me, but you're destroying me. Don't pretend like it's something beautiful. You just want to feed your measly, lonely, little ego. You're a failure because you made yourself a failure. You can't act, because you're not even human. You have no sympathy-- no regard for other people's lives. You need a gun to give you power because you're weak. You're a weak, little man. You make me sick. Cinder. You OK? It's OK. OK, here. Stay here. What this about is understanding that you can't do it all. All you can do when the moment comes is your best. Ah! Marshmallows. Big, fluffy clouds. Bunny rabbits. Sugar. I'm sorry, father. Bonus from Vencini. From now on, Prototel gets all their work in New York. What about the outstanding loan? Tragle tore it up. How did you do that? The man let the shooter six feet from the client. Word gets out on that-- he'll be lucky to get a job at Walmart. So are you going to join me when we get back from our vacation? You find a client that's worth saving-- I'll come down. You got it. Maybe. Thank you. Sure. All right. See you. Take care. I saw that. - No, what? - I said I saw it. No, It wasn't what you thought it was. I owe you a lot. Well, I owe you a lot too. I haven't danced in years. You're a great dancer. Pick a card. Will it tell my future? It's only a card. All right, put it back. Don't look at it. You know something? They don't make guys like you anymore. I guess times change. All right, so you forgot, didn't you? Casey told you she needs school supplies, but oh, no, you're too busy saving women from certain death. You can't take five minutes, go into a store-- I've got 'em.
