DARKROOM - Are you really going to do that? - Why not? Maybe I have an opinion on this? I don't know if you do this often, taking people's photos like that? Sure I do, mostly when they're pretty. Okay, go on then. No, I'm not feeling inspired. Arsehole! No, it's not your fault, it's mine. As a subject, you're too pure, too delicate. Anyway, I'm not in the mood. I'm too stressed. Jeff. It'll work out, alright? I'm sure today will be the day, this is your best work. I have faith. See you tonight. "I love you." Hello. I'm waiting. You've worked hard since last time. I can't fault your technique, but my calendar is full. Just stop, it's been five years of compliments and phony excuses. Just be honest for one second. Just for once. Are you sure? Listen, Jeff. Your photos lack spirit. They lack soul. I've seen them elsewhere, a hundred times. You photocopy reality. You're banal... formulaic... boring. I'm a photographer. This is my life. Good luck then. Say hello to Manon for me. An excellent editor, and most importantly, a great girl. You're very lucky. - Do you like it? - Very much so. Very much so. I think I've made my choice. Very well. Shit... It's my photos that are shit. Come on, it doesn't matter. I know Danton, she's an idiot with no taste. I humiliated myself in front of a crap gallery owner? You always say the right things... You know what? We should get away for a bit. A weekend break. We'll have sex, and you'll give me two kids. Come on! It'll do you good, getting your mind off this. I can't do this anymore. I can't see you like this, unhappy, obsessed with your photos. They're shit. My photos are shit. Just stop. Don't start this again. I'm leaving tomorrow. What did you say? Two days in Berlin. For my catalogue. You forgot, as usual. When it's about me, you don't give a damn. I'm sorry. I'm no good... You're never any good! Ever! When I get back, we need to have a serious talk. - Thank you. - Thank you, Madam. Goodbye. - Young man, if you'd be so kind... - What can I do for you, sir? Oh, save my life! You see, I have something here I treasure more than anything. Sorry, but we don't sell these kinds of cameras. It would be worth it if you did though! It produces the most beautiful pictures, the most fascinating images ever seen. - Believe me. - I don't doubt that, but... Can I leave it here? For a quick service? Just a moment... What's this? Didn't you take down his details? - No name? No phone number? - The guy was here, now he's gone. Nonsense... Where do you reckon I'll find parts for this thing? Get rid of it. You're never happy, are you? You know that's an illness? What's to be happy about? I'm not a photographer with a second job, I'm a fucking idiot salesman who takes pictures on Sundays. I take pictures on Sundays too! They're no worse than those on Monday. It's not working out, Nico. What are you on about? Manon or your photos? Both, they're one and the same. My project is a part of us, it's our life. She always believed in me. She's got shit taste. What I mean is, she's responsible too. Look girls, this isn't a sleepover. Get out front. Hold on, Jeff, what's this here? Didn't I tell you to get rid of this? - I was waiting for the owner... - What? What owner? Don't you see that codger was screwing with you? This isn't a second-hand store. Chuck it in the bin, come on. Get a move on, customers are waiting. Hey, it's me. I wanted to know how you're doing. I hope everything's going well in Berlin. I miss you. Other than that... I'm trying to think of a joke. I'll call when I get one. I love you. That wasn't the joke... Not funny? Well, call me back. Bye. Hello. Could I take some photos? That depends. Does this look like a zoo to you? I'm a photographer. I'm doing a project on homelessness. Ah, aesthetic misery. Here, Sylvaine... I know the game. We see your type over winter... No, I'm really a photographer, not a journalist. Is that any better? Listen here. I've nothing against you, but if you want to take photos, you talk to them yourself. Is that a folding camera? 1920's, 1930's? Yeah, I think so. - Do you take photos? - I used to have a shop. In Opatija, Croatia. Could we get a copy of the photos after? Yeah, of course. Come with us. - Alright, guys? - Alright. - Hello. - Hello. Here we are. Wow. This isn't one of my photos. - Are you joking or being modest? - No, you must have mixed it up. Impossible. I printed and developed them myself, I've had no other orders. It's no big deal, I won't sue you or anything. Shall I put it in the pouch? Sir? If you want, sure. Do you want to talk now, or can we say "hello" first? You're interested in people now? Charming... Did you take these pictures? No, I stole them... Who's that? Jeff, this photo is... What do you think of the others? No, they're great, but this one... Purity and unease, at the same time. You've never said anything like that before. There's a first time for everything. How did you do this? Is it "yes" or "no"? I won't lie, we've had many offers. A private viewing in a month, with full run of the gallery. 50-50 split on each sale. This is very good for a first timer. And, this photo... will be the main attraction. It'll be on posters all over Paris, both close-ups and larger sizes. You don't seem satisfied. No, I am, but there are other images I'd like to showcase. - This is a series I really like... - We're not asking for charity. Alright. I could budge on some of the conditions. - Bravo. - Thanks. We're already reserved a dozen images! They're all mad for that young lady. I've a contact in a Swiss bank, he wants you for a project on the crisis! They're absolute swine, I tell you! I'll make them pay through the nose. Let's keep cool heads about this, that'll stop us drinking too much! Excuse me. I hope you won't be too harsh, this is my first exhibition. I wouldn't dream of it! I respect artists too much to nit-pick their work. - Jean-Pierre Mathieu. - Jeff Gautier. It's troubling, isn't it? It looks like she's scared. Well, we don't know the whole story. - Thanks. - Was that a compliment? Oh, it was! I'm learning! I'm learning... Under what circumstances did you take this photo? Well... She was there, I snapped her, that's it really. Oh, very good. How long ago was this? How many days ago, exactly? - You're no journalist... - Heaven forbid! I'm no good at introductions, excuse me. Captain Jean-Pierre Mathieu, Homicide Department. I'm investigating the murder of Anna Martin. A young woman found dead just over a month ago. Strangled. Raped. Why are you telling me this? Don't you know her? Don't you know Anna, your model? No. I only knew her for a few minutes for the photo, I didn't know... Ah, you artists! Concentrated on your art while the world falls apart. It's fascinating. Excuse me, good evening. We're about to eat, will you be long? - Err... - Oh, excuse me. I've been taking up your time, it's my fault. I'm quite invasive by nature. Can you come tomorrow? We can continue this conversation more calmly, if you'd like. Of course. I'm counting on you! Once again, bravo. Goodbye. Who was that guy? He's an art critic. Belgian. Those Belgians sometimes have contacts... I'll just get my bag. There's something about this girl. How do you mean? I don't know, there's... There's something disturbing. Manon, about this photo, I have to tell you something... She's prettier than me? Is that it? You think she's prettier than me? A thousand times more! Dickhead! Why do you never take photos of me? Because I've got the real thing. Take my picture. Now, like her. What do you mean, like her? Which camera is that? Look into the lens. What is it? - Was I no good? - No, you were, it's just... I'll stop here, I'm tired. - I've had too much to drink... - You're such a little girl! Manon... Shall we? Looks like you had a good night, from what I see. That's great! Come in, come in. Please excuse me for yesterday. - I hope I didn't spoil the party. - Not at all. All the better then! All the better... Please. Honestly, I appreciate you coming here so quickly. Because, normally, people rather look to run away. I have nothing to hide. Brilliant! That'll save us a lot of time. Tell me... Anna... It would very much interest me to know how you met her. I crossed her in the street, then I asked her to pose for me. That's all. How audacious! Do you often do this? Recruiting girls off the street? Is it less expensive that way? It depends, but that's not the question. I don't know what you're thinking, but I did not know this girl. I took the photo, we shook hands and left. I didn't even know her name before meeting you. Very well. What do you want me to say? We did the photo and that was it. It's a very beautiful photo. Captivating. Fascinating. Much more poetic... than these ones. - Why are you showing me these? - Unsettling, isn't it? They could have been taken in the same place, don't you think? The same girl, the same place. Once alive... now dead. I know nothing about this. The pictures aren't clear, they could be from anywhere. Listen, if I was involved, I'd be crazy to use this photo to promote my exhibition! Do you know what's even crazier? It's that I believe you. Part of me, at least. Your lies aren't... logical. Thank you. Can I go? Of course. Right. Thanks. Goodbye. Tell me. As a professional, what do you think of my photos? Honestly? They're not so bad. Well... not terrible either, honestly. See you soon. Hello stranger. - Hello Victor. - I've got work to do. I know I've been useless, I had promised to see you, but... Worthless excuses mean nothing. You come, take photos, then piss off. Life goes on. Tell me. Did you know a girl called Anna? What are you on about? I had just heard a story. - Something dreadful. - Hmm. I don't know. Why are you concerned? Did you know her? Of course I knew her. You don't forget a girl like Anna. Well, for that matter, you must have crossed her too. - How so? - I can't rightly remember... I think she was found here not long after your visit. She was a pretty girl. She wanted to be a hairdresser or a model. Anyway, who cares. Why are you interested in her? - I heard about the murder. - Right. That shook all of us up. We try to forget about it. I suggest you do the same. It's been fun, but I've work to do. What are you doing? Praying? I didn't hear you come in. Alright? Did you not get Danton's message? Your photo is selling like mad! The numbered copies are sold, the Swiss are advertising with it! You're right to pray to her! Thank you, Miss! Her name is Anna. I thought you didn't know her name. No, I... One of her friends recognised her on the exhibition poster. Did you see her again? Of course not, this guy just told me her name. Champagne! Flutes or glasses? Are you bothered? Let's just use glasses. To your new life. Let's say I never took that photo... What? What are you on about? Imagine I never took that photo, I developed the film and it was there. - Can you explain that? - Did you take it or not? Right, okay, the first possibility, somebody "borrowed" the camera, then took a photo instead of you. No, that's impossible. I always have it with me. Okay, second possibility, it was taken by the last owner. They took the photo, they rewind the film reel, and you use it thinking it's a new one. That's it! That must be it. So, you weren't joking then? Lulu! Come here! What does Manon think? Did you tell her? And tell her what? Oh dear. You'd best get your act together. You're going in the doghouse. I have to go check something. Call you tomorrow? I have the kids, they're on holidays, so it's not ideal. - I understand. - Alright? Bye. SÉRAPHIN, EDOUARD MR SÉRAPHIN, EDOUARD FIRST FLOOR MR SÉRAPHIN, EDOUARD Yes? Hello, I'm looking for Edouard Séraphin. It's been ages since Mr Edouard left us. - He's deceased? - Did I say that? I respect people's private lives, sir. It's been nice talking to you, but I've got work to do. SPECIALIST NURSING HOME - Hello. - What do you want? I've come to see Mr Edouard Séraphin. - Do you have an appointment? - Not exactly. No appointment, no visit. This place isn't a train station. But someone by that name does live here, right? I don't have to answer that. It's important I talk to him. I'm sorry. Mr Gautier? Yes? You're on the list. You've been written down every day for three weeks. Mr Edouard is expecting you. End of the corridor, the big door. Thank you. Come closer, come closer. Don't be afraid. You brought it with you? That's bad. May I touch it for a second? Ah, I understand. It's your camera now. You've accepted it. But you'll see, you shan't easily part with it. Explain this to me. Will you let me touch it? That all depends on you. Magnificent. Congratulations. Did she appear on one of your films? Is that it? Did you take this photo? You little arsehole! Answer me. Did you come here by Métro? That's bad. You shouldn't take the Métro. It's poisoned... by the Socialists. They release deadly gases, bought by Mitterrand from the GDR. Mitterrand, what a bastard! Did you kill this girl? Was it you? Tell me! You disappoint me, my boy. I've nothing to do with this girl, and you know it. Who could have taken this picture? Who else? Who other than "it"? "It" sees everything, you know. The things we hide, buried things. The dirtiest things. Not bad, eh? I didn't take this photo. This image, it doesn't really belong to you. It belongs to one of your subjects. Somebody whose photo you've taken. The camera "saw" it in them. It saw what your eye could never see, understand? Yeah, I get it. I see what you're doing here. The person who appears on the same film as the girl... they're the killer. Let me touch it now. One last time. May I? You promised me... I told you nothing! You know nothing! You'll suffer like an animal! She'll never let you go! She'll never leave you in peace! Never! She'll never leave you! What are you playing at? You don't look so good! Your camera is as old as Methuselah! Perhaps I should confiscate it. After all, it witnessed the crime. - It knew the victim... - I told you all I knew. Leave me alone. Don't you give a damn about Anna? I do give a damn. I used to know Anna. She was beautiful. She was 20 years old. And now she's dead. I'll never leave it alone, that's how it is. That's your job, not mine. Who removed her dress? Who raped her? Who strangled her? Who left her body to rot? Fucking look at me! You know something, you've got a hunch. I can feel it. Well lock me up or leave me alone! You've got nothing on me! What does your Manon have to say about this? Sharing an apartment with a dead girl, making money off a cadaver... Does it excite her? Oh, you haven't told her anything! Maybe I'll have to pass on the message myself, don't you think? Okay. Give me some time. What do you want, Jeff? My agent wants other photos. I want to work with these guys, nobody else. Alright, come on. Hello, arsehole. As for Joseph... you can kiss him goodbye. Why? He went off the grid a few weeks ago. - Did he know Anna? - What's it to you? Why ask me that? I don't know. - You said he left, that's strange. - Anna thought only of her looks. If her nice arse could be used to get something, good shit to smoke, a warm bed or help from the cops, she'd do it. You're the first to say something bad about Anna. Everybody knows this. The dead are all angels. At the same time, in the jungle, everyone does what they can. Right? Want some? This is the guy, his name is... Joseph. You know him? A "friend" of Anna's. I've had a run-in with him, in the past. He's a psychopath. Croatian. So? Croatians, Serbians, the war and all that... No? Alright. I'll drop it. According to Joseph's "friends", some of them also being my friends, he vanished just a few hours after the murder. And you think I'm in cahoots with him? You interest me because you've handed me the main murder suspect. Just like that. Out of thin air. I know the people in the camp, we talk. You're too modest, Jeff. You would have made a great cop. You have a kind of sixth sense. I've much to learn from you. We've nothing more to talk about. Arrest this guy and leave me the hell alone. Okay, now we could try... Could you give me a profile shot? Right. Nice and straight. It's very easy, look straight ahead, that's it. Friedrich called me this morning to tell me how happy he is. Oh, thanks. This is really great work, well done. Thanks a lot. - Excuse me. - Sure. "I'm pregnant." Why have you done this to me? Why did you get rid of me like that? Come. Come back. Come back! What is it? Get away! Get away from me! - Do you know what you're saying? - Get out! - Get lost! - This isn't right... I don't understand. I've never seen you like this. Tell me if something is wrong! I'm sorry, I'm not well, I'm not well... I'm so tired, I swear, I don't know what came over me. Tranquilisers, sleeping pills, aspirin... I don't quite understand, sir. Are they for personal consumption? What's the problem exactly? It's complicated. It's a mix of things. Anxiety, fatigue, then... It's mixed together, it's all in one. Do you get it now? Maybe you should see someone. See someone? Funny. Bloody hell. For fuck's sake... Happy birthday! - We kept it a secret! - Happy to see us? Would you like some champagne? Happy birthday, my love. Easy now! Save some for later! Patrick, put some music on, we're falling asleep here! The more power guys have, the more their brains shrink. Know what he said yesterday? Everything has to be put away in five minutes! Hold on, I don't have four arms! I'm not Vishnu! You would have knocked him out! I had to ask him to explain himself. I looked at him, I felt myself shaking... Are you listening to me or don't you care? Alright, Jeff? - Look at her, look at her... - What did you say? Manon... Do you notice anything? Honestly? I always ask myself why a girl like that is with a guy like you. No, don't you think she's changed? Physically? Pregnancy does that. Do you know why I think she's changed? I'll tell you, mate... It's not her. That girl isn't Manon, it's as simple as that. She's no elephant either, don't exaggerate. Oh, so you weren't joking... Jeff! Hello? They always come back. The always end up coming back here. But you took your sweet time. I'm listening, young man. Did you leave the clinic? If only you knew how sweet life is when you rid yourself of your obsessions. I must thank you for taking that camera off me. You've been taking care of it, I hope. Take it back. Well now, young man! No, no! That would be too easy. It's your camera now. It's your story. - I need to understand... - I did warn you. But you just did as you pleased! I saw her. She's all I can see. Those poor lost souls. They always come back. They get into your head and never let go, that's how it is. How... how do I get her to go away? That's the big question, right? Who has the answer? Who else but yourself? You went through the same thing, am I right? You know. I'm listening... This man... This is the man who made the extra photo appear. A child... Go on. This child... He's your son? This man, did he kill your son? They said there were "complications". An operation that "didn't go well". "It happens, it was an accident." But I could feel it. His big doctor's hands, his clumsiness, his lack of concentration. He killed my son! The camera confirmed what I already knew. And after, did you have visions? Did you see your son? I've lived a thousand deaths, young man. You have no idea. Help me, Edouard. That's very wise of you, young man. Search deep inside yourself. You know the truth, but you won't admit it, because you're afraid. So, face your fear and you'll find the answer. There, you've got it. You have the answer. What would you have done in my place? Did you... kill that guy? I strangled him, to be precise. Did the ghosts go away? That's for you to decide. What's most important in your life? Success? The photos? Awards? Or... My wife. I want my wife back. Find Anna's killer then. And punish them. That's what Anna wants from you. That's the price to pay if you want her to leave. Go on then. Alright? Super. Peachy. Go back home, Jeff. It isn't worth it. I'm not going anywhere until you help me. Okay. That guy over there, with the blue beanie. That's the guy I was on about. Joseph's best mate. Thanks. Alright, mate? If it isn't the photographer... You look for Joseph, and now you find Joseph! Put it away, you'll hurt yourself. - I know it's you. - Me, what? Your head's messed up, little photographer. I heard things about you and about Anna. Shut up! Don't move! Don't move! Are you crazy to have come here? - Are you mad? A nut job? - That's enough. Were you the one who killed Anna? "God, protect me. I am his shepherd. I am unafraid for my soul to be stolen." Stop him! Are you alright? Cheese! Sorry. It's for my records. You have no idea how happy I am to see you again. What am I doing here? Does it hurt? Why... What do you want? I was worried! You fall off the radar, then we find you at the hospital. Some sad story about a punch-up with some homeless guys. With a certain Joseph? Right? Did you find him? With Joseph, it's complicated. It's complicated, fishing for those kind of guys. They swim in the depths of the filth, then they don't often surface, that's how it is. He doesn't interest you now? It's Anna that interests me. Nobody else. I always thought pictures were like mirrors. That's not true. They reveal things, they're confessions. They're priests. Don't you think? Oh, hey. Mr Edouard sends his best wishes. He's quite prickly, that Edouard. None too fresh, either. What will we be like at his age? Who knows. What did he tell you? What do you want from me? The camera, Jeff. I want your camera. My witness. Edouard is an old man, he's just left the madhouse. I know. I love old crazies. I understand them. Don't you know where your camera is? What an actor! I lost it. I sold it. The camera... Please. What are you doing here? My job. Even if you were the President, I'd kick your arse right now. - Are you endangering my patient? - He is. Outside, or I'll scream. You know I was only joking. You, get some rest. Your head is in a bad way. Your wife is waiting for you. I don't want to see her. She's been here every day. She's taken care of you. I'm telling you, she loves you so much. It's lovely to see, if I may say so. It's up to you. Jeff... I was so frightened. Look at me! Please. Look at me! Let me help you. I don't know how to say this... I wanted you to be proud of me, I was scared to lose you, you see? So now, you see me as her? You don't believe me, do you? You think I'm completely mad. That's normal. If I still had the camera, I could prove I'm right. Here. You held it so tightly, it was tough for them to prise it from you. The film is here, I photographed her killer. - You'll see Anna's photo appear. - Jeff... What? Nothing. Let's develop that film. It's him, it has to be! This doesn't make sense! There must be something you've overlooked. All the people on Anna's reel are in this photo. They're all there. There must be something else. I don't know, have you checked every inch? Here, look. What's that? Do you know what it could be? - Damn, I have to check something. - What? - I'll go, you stay here. - No, I'm coming with you. No No way, stay here, lock the door, don't open for anyone, okay? Captain Mathieu, please. - No can do. - I have to see him. - It's very important. - Too late, he left an hour ago. When will he be back? Never. He packed his boxes. He's taking his retirement. You know, retirement? You know, the thing where you watch TV all day. What did you want with Mathieu? There are other officers here! Manon? Manon! Please sign, for the war. Not right now. You shouldn't talk like that, Mr Jeff... What? What did you say? - How do you know my name? - I just do. You've got a meeting with someone. - Don't play mind games, it's dumb. - A man. He has what you want, you have what he wants. What's this bullshit? - Who told you about me? - He's waiting. Who? And where? - A man is waiting for you. - Where? "In the photo" he said. He's waiting "in the photo". What have you done to her? A couple of slaps, then something to get her to sleep. Nothing serious. For now. It was you in the photo. How did I look? I've never been too happy with my image. Why did you kill her? Anna was a little whore. I thought she loved me. I was a bit irritated, let's say... She wasn't my type anyway. Give me the camera. You're tiring me. I see you. My friend! My old friend! It'll be alright, don't worry. We'll find you a new master. SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
