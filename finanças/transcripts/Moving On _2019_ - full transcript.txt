Okju. Let's go. Put the bag on the seat. Dad! Is Grandpa's house big? Sure, much bigger than ours. Are you excited to see Grandpa? Not really. You told him we're coming? Of course! He's expecting us. I long for that faraway place where my beloved resides. At such a distance, my heart aches even more. As I walk a cosmos-strewn path, thoughts echo in my mind and my sad heart cries, I miss you. Let's go, Dongju. This way. Grandpa got heat stroke, so he's in the hospital. You two get settled while I pick him up. - Is he alright? - Yeah, it’s nothing serious. Go on inside! Hey! Hurry up. Coming. Hey. Dongju, they're back! Careful. You should've opened the door in this heat. Hello. Hello. So, Dad... This is Okju. And this is Dongju. They've grown, right? - Say hi. - Hello, Grandpa. Turn the fan on. Where'd you find that chair? Upstairs. Good job. Share this with Dongju. Eat up, Dad. Go ahead. Don't be shy. I'm not shy. Eat up. Dad. You should eat something. Right. At least have some broth. You know, I thought we might stay here for the summer break. Besides, I worry about you being alone. Is that okay? Sure, do that. Oh, I almost forgot. You like to add sugar. - Just a bit. - Yeah. We haven't eaten this for ages. - Good, huh? - Yeah. - Even better with Grandpa here? - Yeah. Eat up. - Hey. - What? Turn out the light and go. But I'm sleepy. Get out. I want to sleep in the mosquito net. This is my room, go somewhere else. No! - Go! - No. This is my room. I don't want to. It's cramped in there! It's cramped in here, too. I'm going to sleep, so leave. I've nowhere to go. You call yourself a sister? Fine, take it all for yourself! Hey! Lie down and sleep. I have no room to sleep in. Just sleep next to me. Go sleep next to your sister. She keeps saying it's only her room. Why would she say that? Tell her to share. Dad, I want to sleep in there. Whatever. Alright. - Sleep tight. - Yeah, good night. Dad! - Hey. - Oh, hi. Dad, is your headache gone? Feeling better? You scared me. Did he get a CT scan? Yeah. You know how hot it's been. Even young people are getting heat stroke. Jeez. When do the results come back? Don't worry too much. It's so hot these days, even I get exhausted. If he rests a few days and eats well, he'll feel better. Dad, you're really okay? I'll drive the car up front. Take your time bringing him out. Dad, you can get up. Let's go. I got you. Careful. - I’ll get the car. - Okay. Hey, stop it. It's fun! Don't go around touching things. What's this button? Where are you going, Sis? Okju, look! I found a soccer ball. Okju! Okju! Let me ride it. Your legs are too short! Out of the way. Hey! Dad, watch your step. We're still unpacking, so the house is a mess. Did you bring a lot? Not really. We threw out a lot of old junk. One step at a time. Dongju! Okju! Aunt Mijung is here. Okju! Dongju! Come here, kids! Wow, you're big! Okju, you're all grown up! How long has it been? - Not long? - No idea! - I'm tall now. - Wow! Hey, get down! When did you get so tall and heavy? Let's cook something tasty. Like what? Let me see... Something good! Smells good. Yeah, I smell soy sauce. Right. Have a taste. Oh, my bad. It’s on your face. Byunggi. When did we last meet? Thanksgiving? No. I was in China then. Oh, you're right. Then when was it? Let me see... At Uncle Jinyoung's wedding in Suwon. Oh, right. We met at the wedding. - Oh, we did. - Yeah, I remember! Jinyoung's family was late, so you greeted people at the door. Yeah, right. Jinyoung was really grateful. Was it Greece? On his honeymoon he bought me a gift. Some nice soap. I got that, too. Oh, man. So it wasn't just me? Anyhow, did you tell Sunho you're eating here? Why? I don't report to him. It's my life. You should sleep over! - Should I? - Yeah. - I‘ll snuggle up with Dongju. - Yay! Get shoes for the best price! Come take a look! Come and buy shoes! You can stay longer. No, I should get back. I owe you big time for this. It's nothing. Who is it? Okju, it's me! - Mijung. - Huh? How old were you here? I think it was my 7th grade spring picnic. So that's where it was. You were cute. - I’ll put this on the desk. - Okay. Wow. You even have a mosquito net. You should sleep in here. What? Sleep with me. Okay, thanks. Hello? Mijung? Where are you? Hey, Okju. Where were you? I went for a walk. I'm gonna wake everyone up. Okju, you saved me. When did you get so tall? Okju. Do you want some? Oh! It feels like a school trip, sneaking around like this. Let's go in. Hang on. What? Does it smell like beer? Okju! Open the door! Okju! Come on! Hurry and open up! I said open the door! Okju! Oh, man. Come on, open up! Okju! Forget it! Mijung. Say something to Okju. She locked me out again. Hey, Dongju. If you're bored, go talk to Grandpa. He can't understand what I say. What do you mean? He would love talking to you. But what should I say? Huh? Well, let's see. You can ask if he's hot, or just talk about your day. He'd like whatever you say. Go to him. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Yes, thank you. What in the world! They let you borrow that? Of course. Wow. You really have a way with people. This burner makes it taste great. You know, my people skills are how I get by. Right. Here. Thank you. I almost forgot. Dad's birthday is next week. Right. Should we get him something? Well... Money won't do him any good. How about a small party? Sure. I'll grill you more squid. This is great. Why's it so good? Just make him leave! Hurry up and send him away! - You make me sick! - After what you did? How can you do this to me? You're a selfish bastard. Grow up, will you? Okju. Byunggi, kick him out! - Open this door! - Trust me! - Hey, come on. - Just go. - Go away. - How can you do this to me? - Talk to me. - But still! Grandpa, you should go to sleep. - You can talk to me. - Listen to what she’s saying! - What the hell did I do? - Stop shouting! I don't deserve this shit from you! Sunho, come on. - Calm down. - Wait just a minute! Okju. Mijung asked for salt. - Give this to her. - Okay. You are so busted. You hear me? Jeez. I barely got rid of him. What's going on? Huh? What is it? Tell me. Come on. What is it? Did he cheat on you? Then what? Did he screw something up? - Byunggi. - Yeah. Why does he do that? He's like a monster. Like someone out to get me. Oh, gosh. Hey... If something was wrong, you should've told me. I was embarrassed! Why be embarrassed? Look at me. How can I show my face? Jeez. You know, I can't keep living like this. I won't. Oh my. You know what I went through. Think it over. Okay? Don't rush into anything. Got it? You know what? Thinking of divorce makes me excited. I was desperate to have kids, but now I'm so glad I don't have any. That thought came to me. You should hear yourself. Okju. You have a boyfriend, right? Actually, I think it's good to date a lot of guys when you're young. That’s how you learn about them. The way I see it, guys who are responsible and trustworthy and take care of their family, they're the best. Find guys like that. What? Is it funny to hear me say that? It's not funny. Hey, stop it! You're dead! Here. What's this? It's a gift. Size 9, right? It’s a late birthday gift. You didn't have to do this. Try them on. Okay. They're nice. They look good. Can I try walking in them? They suit you. Keep 25-30cm from the trench... While excavating the pile, you should place... Hey. Dongju, wake up. You need to wake up! Why? You're late for school. - Wake up already. - What time is it? Hurry up and get ready. Why'd you wake me up now? Wash up. Hey, it’s summer vacation! Oh, man. I was sleeping like a baby. Why'd you wake me up? - Go back to sleep. - Alright. When operating an excavator... You can put them here. Oh, gosh! By the way, do you make much selling fabric? Is it a good business? Why? You interested? No! I'm just curious. When I get some seed money, I thought I might try it out. Everyone's struggling these days. - Really? - It's tough. I see. There we go. Looks like you sell shoes. Ah! I've got some nice ones. Tell me if you need any. I’ll give you a discount. Nice, huh? Are these legit? Of course! - Not interested? - Maybe next time. Okay, then. I'll get going now. - Thanks again. - Bye! Question 37. What is not a drawback of a hydraulic motor? A. You must take care that air and dust don't contaminate the hydraulic fluid. B. Controlling speed and direction is difficult with the relief valve. B! Wrong, wrong, wrong! - Wrong answer! - Oh man, let me see. Why's it so complicated? - Dongju. - Yeah? - Go somewhere else. - Why? Go do something. But I have nothing to do. Guess I'll watch TV. Dad, how's your studying going? Not that great, it's hard. You did a lot. Not really. I’m doing the problems in the back, but I can’t understand a thing. What is it? Dad, how much money do we have? Why? Don't worry. Can you lend me some money? How much? About $700. Hey, why do you need $700? I want... to get my eyes done. The valve... You've got to be kidding me. I told you to go. No, I'm gonna play with Dad. Dad, I only want to borrow it. I'll pay you back. You don't need plastic surgery. You're pretty already. Dad... Next question. Okay. Question 38. - Here. - Oh. Help Dad. This way. I should've brought my credit card. I'll wire you the money tomorrow. No need to. Don't worry. - Byunggi. - Huh? Are you really okay? Of course! Just see to yourself. Okay. - Ta-da! - You carry the cake. How about Dongju? What if he drops it? Will you drop it? Yup! Dad, I want the party popper. No, you'll scare Grandpa. Bummer. Then let Dongju carry it. No, it should be Okju. Dongju can follow her. Okay. Then I'll go bring Dad out. Alright. This looks good. It's really pretty. Isn't it? Why can't Dongju do it? Keep your eyes closed! Careful there. Careful. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Grandpa Happy birthday to you Dad, make a wish! Hey, it's not your birthday. Blow it out. Grandpa, I love you! Dad, happy birthday. Good job, kiddo. You too, Okju. Great watermelon. - Yeah, it's really good. - So sweet. You picked out a good one. - Dongju, eat up. - Yeah. Want more? - More watermelon. - Okay. Here. Dongju, you sing well. - He’s good. - He can do everything. - This is tasty. - Eat your fill. Grandpa. What's this? Wow! Unbelievable! Wow! You got him a present! Let me see. - Wow, awesome. - When did you get that? Dad, try it on. Yeah, put it on. Wow! When did you buy him that? Okju is really something! Okju, I want a present. What? Dad, can I get an early birthday present? What kind of present? A smartphone. If you dance for us, I'll think about it. - Really? - Yeah! Come on, dance for a smartphone! I'd do it if I were you. - Well? - Okay. Here we go! Let's see what you've got. The funky dance! - What's that? - Oh my! Happy birthday, Grandpa! I wish you a long and healthy life I hope you live for a long time Happy birthday, Grandpa! Okay, sit down now. Don't dance for anyone else. You should buy him a phone. You did well, kiddo. That was hilarious. Give me the toothpaste. - Hey. - Yeah? You didn't have to kiss their butts. What did I do? Keep your pride. You're not getting a phone anyway. Okju! You're the bootlicker! - Hey! - What? What did you say? You're the bootlicker! - You're asking for it! - Yup. Come out here. Come on! Hey! I don't want to! I said come out! I said I don't want to! Oh, jeez. You better stay there forever. Don't you dare come out! Oh, it would be my pleasure! Arrrgh! What? No, I was just... When I was Dongju's age, I was sleeping in the living room when Grandpa shook me awake. I looked at the clock and it was 8:30. I was in big trouble. I was already late for school even if I left right away. After throwing a tantrum, I washed up and went outside and it was night. Dad was messing with you? Yeah! - Can you believe it? - I didn’t know he did that. Who knows! He didn’t even smile, making that glum face. I couldn't believe it. How come I don't remember? You weren't home then. You were probably just born, at the hospital. Oh right. If you were Dongju's age. Yeah. But when I woke up, I felt like my life was over. - Jeez. - You got that right! I even got goosebumps! You could've slept longer. But after forgetting all about it, I dreamt about it. Isn't it odd? That must feel strange. Yeah, it did! Why dream about it now after all these years? Yeah. ....my heart aches even more. As I walk a cosmos-strewn path, thoughts echo in my mind and my sad heart cries, I miss you. I long for my beloved however much I try to forget Will my heart's call reach up to that lofty autumn sky? With no hope of reunion, I ache for those days... - Are your hands clean? - Yeah. Alright, good job. Dongju, go get peppers from the garden. I don’t like peppers. Just for the garnish. Pick some pretty ones. Okay. - Dongju. - Yeah? - Can you tell which ones are spicy? - Yeah. - How? - They’re small. That's right, go on. Alright. - Dongju. - Yeah? The noodles are done, so tell Okju to come down. I want to eat with her upstairs. It's hot up there. It's okay. No peppers, please. I'll switch with Okju. They may argue sometimes, but they get along pretty well. Yeah. Should we wake Dad up? Yeah, maybe. Is he tired? We can make him more later. - Let's clean up and eat. - Yeah. Okju! - What? - I brought noodles. Okju. - What? - Mom wants to see us. Why? Why not? She said to come during vacation. Forget it. Then I'll go alone. Hey. Don't you have any self-respect? Nope. You run whenever she calls? If you sneak off and see her, you're dead. Why laugh? She didn't even show up last time. That was then. It wasn't even that long ago. Okju! Where are you going? The library. Here, take these. Sorry, but can you call your brother? - Now? - Yeah. They look new, but I want to check. If you don't like them I'll just give you a refund. That's not right. I came all the way here. Just call him, it's not that hard. I just need to check. Just give them back. What are you doing? Are you messing with me? Just call him! Huh? Hey, hey! I'm her father. Take a seat. I just wanted to make sure they weren't knockoffs. Yes, I'm sorry. I said I'd give back your money. Okju, get in the car. - Why? - Just get in. Don't go around selling knockoffs! Yes, I'm sorry. Stop selling knockoffs! I'm sorry, sir! Put your seat belt on. Why didn't you say they were mine? Dad, were they knockoffs? Well... They're from the same factory. So embarrassing. Mijung. Yeah? What is it? Do you still miss Grandma? My mom? I miss her every day. When I was just a baby, my mom held me in her arms and ran across the crosswalk. I have a vivid memory of that. I thought that it was an actual memory. But think about it. If I was wrapped in a bundle, then it's a dream, not a memory. Right? I'm surprised you still dream about her. What's surprising about that? It's just because I miss her. What about you? Don't you miss her? I don't have dreams. - Mijung. - Hmm? There's this guy I'm seeing. Yeah? But he never calls me unless I contact him first. Hmm... Do you think he's just not that into me? Well, I don't know. Is he shy? I'm not sure. I'm going to sleep. Okay. Goodnight. Okju! I said you're not allowed up here. Something's wrong with Grandpa. What? He pooped his pants. Mijung said to stay upstairs. Take your time coming out. Alright. Hold on to me. This way. It’s nothing, go back upstairs. Come on. Dad, have some grapes. It was pretty dry this season, so they're sweet. Sweet, right? Well then, enjoy. They're so sweet! Yeah, they're really good. Grapes are sweet after a dry season. So, guys... I already talked with your dad, but I want to know what you think. About what? It's about Grandpa, whether it's better to keep him here, or to move him to a nursing home. Why should we decide that? What? I know it's not our decision, but what I mean is... As a family, we're just talking to see where we all stand. Your dad and I will be working, so that means you kids will spend the most time with Grandpa. I don't mind. Okju, what about you? I like having Grandpa around. Besides, this is his house to start with. Right, but I mean... We have to work out the details because Grandpa's not well. When school starts for you guys, we need to have someone taking care of Grandpa here. And so... That's my point. - How are you doing? - Hello. This is their break time. I see. Have a look. They're watching TV. Take a look around. Great view there. I'll look forward to your call. Think it over. - Have a good day. - Thank you. - Goodbye, now. - Bye. Okju. Okju! Where did you get all that? Mom got them for me. These are yours. I told you not to see her. Not again! Give them to me. No, they're mine! Hey! I told you not to meet her! Stop it! Let go! You didn't buy them! Hey! Give it. You didn't even buy them! Did you just yell at me? Who are you yelling at! Don't speak to me like that! Dammit! Give them to me! No! I said no! What's your problem?! Why are you doing this to me? What are you crying for? It's okay, get back in your room. Let's put this on. I feel a bit weird. Of course. To think that when I grow old, my kids might send me off, too. The date's not for a while. And we can visit often. Yeah. Today's not that hot, right? Right. Summer's about to wind down. I'd rather have the cold. This summer was unbearable. Isn't the heat better? When it's cold, I get depressed. - Sentimental in winter? - No. I didn't know that. You know how it is, the cold wind nips at your nose. But for me, I sniffle a lot more in winter. Didn't know that. By the way, after Dad leaves for the nursing home, I thought we'd stay a bit longer. Byunggi. You know the house isn't yours, right? Of course! Then, what would you think about selling it? Hmm... We can’t leave it empty, right? Let's think about it. To be honest, I never said anything before, but those times that you used Dad's money, I had to get by on my own since I'm the younger daughter. It wouldn’t be fair if you took the house after all that. Don't think that way. When did I say I wanted the house? I'm just hoping to stay a bit longer. I hope you don't think I've had nothing to complain about. I just kept silent because you were struggling. I know. Hello? Ah, yes. Oh, I see. Can you hold on a minute? What is it? Someone wants to see the house. Oh, really? You stay here while I step out with Dad. Alright. I'll tell her to come over. Okay. Hello... Yes, yes. It'll be more spacious once you tidy up. Yes, I know what you mean. Is this the master bedroom? Yes. - Want a look? - Yes. Excuse me. Oh! It's bigger than I expected. Isn't it? The upstairs has a lot of sunlight. - Yes, since it faces south. - Wow. Is this another room? - Yes, would you like to see it? - Yes, please. Okju, come out for a second. So it's your daughter's room. I'll call you back. Hi. Say hello. She's very pretty. I'll take a quick look. Dad... Talk later. It's smaller than the master bedroom? Yes, since it's upstairs. It's perfect for kids. That's right. You get so much sunlight. Go in. It's nice and spacious. But still, this isn't Seoul and redevelopment isn't likely. Right. With a discount I'd be ready to sign. I'll talk it over with my family. Yes, I see. - Hope we can work it out. - Yes, we'll see. Let me open that for you. - Thank you. - Bye. - Have a good day! - Thank you. Are you going somewhere? What? Are you selling the house? The house? It won't happen overnight. And it's not for you to worry about. Did you tell Grandpa? Um... Dad, you shouldn't go behind Grandpa's back. Yeah, but... You wanted to move out, too. That has nothing to do with this. Sending Grandpa away and selling his house is all wrong! What's wrong? Huh? Look who's talking! Didn't you sell my shoes without permission? Why bring that up? Think about it. It's exactly the same. How is it the same? How is it different? Forget it! Hey! Hey! What's the matter? Is something wrong? What's your family like? What? What are they like? I don't know. Can I show off my shoes to Jusang? What for? Just because. By the way, where did you get them? What are you doing? Hey, Okju! Let go! Okju! Okju. Out of the way. Okju. What is it? Grandpa passed out, so they went to the hospital. What? Hello? Yeah, I'm home. How is Grandpa doing? When are you coming home? Alright. What did he say? Grandpa's okay, so they’ll be home soon. Are you hungry? Are you? Should I make you noodles? Sure. I'm sorry I hit you the other day. Did we fight? I can't remember. It's okay. I heard even Gandhi used to be a gangster. Says who? His biography. Wait. You read biographies? Of course, you know I love books! Yeah right, I've never seen you read. - Is it good? - Yeah. Next time, I'll cook for you. Okju. When is Dad coming? He'll be home soon, go to sleep. Can I sleep here? Hello? Yeah. Yeah. Where? Alright. But I don't have nice clothes. Okay. Dongju. Dongju, wake up. Why? Dongju, wake up. Leave me alone. Dongju. What? Grandpa passed away. Why? We have to go to his funeral. Get up. Deceased: Lee Youngmuk Son: Lee Byunggi ; Daughter: Lee Mijung You're here. Mijung. The kids are here. Thanks for bringing Dongju. Have you eaten? Yes. This guy's combat skill is "Bush." Are you listening? Yeah. “Bush” damages you by 20 points, so that leaves you with 40 points. Are you really listening? Yeah. Okju, do you think Mom will come? Why would she come? She might. She knew Grandpa. She won't come. Oh my goodness, you're here. How did you find out? Thanks so much. I'll wake him up. Byunggi, your ex is here. What? Dongju and Okju, your mom's here. You came. I didn't want to bother you. Okju, Mom's here. Dongju. We'll get you some food. Yeah, you should eat something. Why don't you stay a bit? Mom, you should eat. Okju, come join us. Mom, let me show you a dance. You're going to dance? Yeah, show us! Oh boy, here we go again Oh boy, here we go again The beggar who came last year didn't die and visited again Oh boy, here we go again Oh boy, here we go again Okju. Okju, wake up. Okju. Mom stopped by. She said not to wake you, and left this for you. Mom was here? Yeah. Dad says to come eat. Go inside while I park the car. Why are you out here? Huh? Is the door stuck? Let's go inside. Come on. Dongju, come on. Is the stew a bit bland? Yeah. While it was boiling, I thought it was too salty so I added some water. But now it's too bland.
