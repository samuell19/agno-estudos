(INTENSE MUSIC) (FIRE CRACKLES) Michelle, what have you done? What happened? We had a little party. Things got a little crazy. (LAUGHS MANIACALLY) What? Nicholas, is that you? MICHELLE: What's left of him. The orderlies sure are rough, we're gonna file a complaint. What happened to you? Well I guess I got a little too close to the fire. Your face! Ohh, goo, goo, goo, goo. Isn't he handsome? (LAUGHS EVILLY) All the girls love a scar. Listen to me, we can fix this. We can fix this. Oh, we are. We are. We're gonna be fixing this 'til Christmas. We're gonna be like busy, little elves fixing everything you've done. Help me! Nobody's coming. They were being so loud. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Well, I had to make them all quiet. (CHUCKLES QUIETLY) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (FLAME WHOOSHES) (FIRE CRACKLES) (PAIR LAUGHS MANIACALLY) I was playing a game, you do understand. What's my name? Say it. What's my name? Say it. Say it! Say it! Say it! What's my name, say it! Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa Claus! (INTENSE MUSIC) (WIND BLOWING) (CUSTOMERS CHATTING) (MAN CLATTERING) Anything for the children? Don't jump out on people! People usually see my coming in this get up. How was I supposed to avoid you? C'mon, it's for the kids at Christmas. I don't have any change. Yeah, they all say that. Merry Christmas anyway. So, I'm gonna take you out Christmas Eve. Yeah, and then who's gonna serve the coffee? You gotta be such a ball breaker? Yeah, you bet your ass I am. You can break my balls any time you'd like! Yeah, sweetie, I already knew that. Hey, she can sit on my lap! Give it a rest, Larry! You can sit on my lap! - What's her story? - No idea. Not much of a talker, but she comes here all the time. - Alone? - Always. Hmm, maybe I can take her out for Christmas Eve. Douchebag. What, you said no! She said no, right? WAITRESS: Want a top up on your coffee? Oh! Yes, please, thank you. DAD: I'd love a cup. I just told you I don't have... Better make it large coffee. What are you doing here? You don't leave your mother and I much choice, you don't return our calls. Dad... It's okay. I know it's still raw. But you gotta move on. - I am. - DAD: Really? Yes, that's why I left Woodridge. And now sit here most nights in this diner? Isn't this where you and Joe would come? How do you know that? Your mother found it in an old Facebook photo of you both. And today would've been his birthday. Like that matters now. Baby, of course it matters still! It'll matter your whole life. But that's what I want you to have, a life. WAITRESS: Are we gonna have anything to eat tonight? No, thanks. Courtney, come home. - What... - Just for Christmas. Back to the scene of the crime? Back to your family. Your mother's in pieces. We miss you. I can't, it's only been a year. Do you remember learnin' to ride that mean old horse, Buck? And he threw you off... Dad, this isn't (BANGS LOUDLY) like riding a horse! Okay? Joe died. A lot of people died. A lot of them were friends of mine and I watched his face as he did it. I can still see his face every time I close my eyes. And he's still out there! So yeah, I ran, to a city full of people so I could get lost, so they won't find me. My name isn't even Courtney here. Yeah. I want you to take this. ♪ Have yourself a merry little ♪ What, did you rob a bank? No, it's a month's earning from the shop. We'll be okay. I'm okay, really.

And now you'll never know. It's nice to see you again, Jim. Remember, I told you I would. Yeah, I remember you. You were nothing then and you're less than nothing now. (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) Same old Jim. The only way this ends is by me finishin' what I started. And to do that, I need everybody back together again. The whole family, at the most wonderful time of the year. Now! But I'm gonna pray, pray, pray, because, Jim, won't give up his baby girl, and I don't blame you. What father would? So if Christmas isn't enough to bring the whole family back together, you know the only other thing that really unites a family? A funeral. (INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (WIND HOWLING) Ah, sir, look who just showed up. Them damn feds always stickin' their noses in the local business. I dunno why they're damn interested in a DUI car crash. Little level away from D.C. isn't it agent? It's Special Agent Natalie Parker, this is Agent Jack Zimmerman. We'll take it from here, Sheriff. You be my guest, but why? That's Jim Boden's car, right? Yeah, we already informed the family. What did you tell them? That he'd been drinking, skidded off the road and wasn't wearing a seatbelt. Black ice related accidents happen way too much this time of year. Good, good. Sorry? Good that you told them this was an accident. I don't follow. He is the father of Courtney Boden, one of the original Woodridge Massacre survivors. Oh sure, but I don't... This close to Christmas, we're not taking any chances. You think they're back? I think they made the FBI's 10 Most Wanted for a good reason. But surely they'd be... I also think we shouldn't take and chances, Sheriff. Let my team take a look. All yours. Where's the body? He's further into the woods. Show me. Guessin' he bled out here in the cold. The injuries look bad from the impact. Open it up. So he crawled out in the woods to get help? Hell, after a smash like that he wouldn't know which way was in and which way was out. He was probably worried the car was gonna go up. You find his phone? Not yet. Get me a cause of death. JACK: On it. And find me his phone. We got his records, he didn't make any calls. Yeah, but if he died alone out here, it should be here. And if it isn't, that means someone took it away. Okay! We're gonna conduct a ground search for the victim's cell phone! Let's organize two 10-man teams and cordon the path from here to the car! Let's go, people! Could just be an accident. You look hard enough at anything and you'll find connections. I hope I'm wrong. In cases like this, we often see people trying to blame themselves, which is totally pointless. It's not what your father would've wanted. No, my father wanted me to come home. Courtney... I don't blame myself for my father's death, I just wish that the last thing he asked of me was not something that I said no to. It's not something you get to take back. If I could do it again I would get in that car a thousand times over. And you'd both be dead. I'd rather be dead than feel guilty about living. The only time you should feel guilty about living is if you're wasting your life. I haven't cried since getting the call about my dad. Trauma can sometimes interfere with the grieving process. Yeah, but what kind of daughter doesn't cry when she finds out her dad's dead? Am I evil? What? No. You hear about psychopaths and serial killers and they don't cry because they don't have any emotion. Because they're evil. Courtney, listen to me, you're not evil. I've seen evil, believe me. I've looked it right in the eye, and you are not it. I'm gonna give you something for anxiety. I want you to get some decent sleep. What if I don't wanna sleep? (INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) What if I don't wanna sleep? Can I? I'm afraid we need to delve much deeper here, Nicholas. I need more time before I can feel comfortable releasing you. I want to see Lucy and Jennifer. I wanna see my family. Nicholas... Don't call me Nicholas! My mother called me Nicholas, and I fucking hate my mother! Don't! We need to think about... You wanna know what I think? I understand you're upset. I'm not upset. You've never seen me very upset. I've just got this problem. I wanna go, and you don't wanna let me. It's a problem. It's my problem. And we all know how I solve my problems. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hey, I thought you were at work. I was working from home today. I thought you had a double shift. No, I don't have a job. I'm not talkin' to you, I'm talkin' to my daughter. - Mom, please. - Sorry, was that rude? Whatever. Why do you that? Becky, keep it down? (WIND HOWLING) - Here you go, ma'am. - Thanks. Did we confirm this current address for the Bodens? Yeah, why? This isn't the quickest route home. He got off the highway too early. He may have been avoiding traffic. That time of night? Check it. We found somethin'. The phone? No. (SLOW DRAMATIC MUSIC) I thought you looked here. Once we found the body there was no need to look any further. Jack? Boss? Wake everyone up. Oh my God. They're back. Got it. And this just became a murder investigation. Want me to inform the family? No! This stays a media blackout. What do you think they want? What they always want, to play a game. What do you think it means? I don't know, but if we don't figure it out a lot of people are gonna die. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Yes? Oh my God. Okay. Thank you, yes, we'll be in contact. Bye. (LOUD KNOCKING) Hey sweetie? I have some bad news. I just got off the phone with our caseworker from witness protection. Jim Boden was killed in a car accident. You know what the roads are like around here and he did like a drink. There'll probably be a funeral next week. No! We're not going. It's too risky. Sweetie, when your stepfather died the same day as Courtney's boyfriend, Courtney still showed up to Frank's funeral. Maybe this isn't about what you want or what you can do. Maybe you should think about what Courtney needs right now. No, mom, not now, not this close to Christmas. I just can't. (INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (MAN SPEAKING QUIETLY) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) She wants out! Who? Well, Mrs. Claus, of course. That's not real, Michelle. And even if it were, what kinda Mrs. Claus would wanna hurt people? - Bad people. - What? She only hurts the naughty ones. (GIGGLES LOUDLY) How do you know who's naughty? Why, Santa tells me, of course! (LAUGHS MANIACALLY) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Where is she? Nicholas, focus. Think about what you're doing. Oh, I've had plenty of time to think ever since you left us in that place. Do you remember, doctor? Asking me to think of a goal, something to work towards. But I could never quite get it, could I? So no we'll have to settle for good, old fashioned revenge! If you really care about Michelle... Don't call her that! Look at her! What have you done to her? Why, I've set her free. I've given her everything she could ever want. And what's that? Well, to make a list of everybody who was naughty and nice to her. So tell me, doctor, which one do you think you were? Please, my daughter's coming home soon. Please! Too late! (DOCTOR SCREAMING LOUDLY) (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) Michelle, this is what happens when you don't deal with your demons in real life. (SENSUAL MUSIC) Whoa, that's a lotta light. I guess you wanna guarantee you're not missing anything. Like it? Babe. Babe. I mean we can always do something else if you wanted to. Babe! C'mon, give me something! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (LAUGHING EVILLY) (SCREAMING LOUDLY) You know, I can't decide whether you two were about to be really naughty or really nice, but you're not on my list. You're deviant, aren't ya? So let's play this game in a way you'll understand. I wanna give you a safe word so I stop squeezing. What do ya think Mrs. Claus? What should the safe word be? Bite me. Say it. Bite me. (SCREAMING LOUDLY) Yay! (LAUGHS LOUDLY) Die. We gotta get going, honey, I don't know what the roads are gonna be like with all the snow, I gotta find parking. I don't even know where my keys are right now anyway. Lucy McKay? Who are you? I'm Agent Jack Zimmerman, FBI. How the hell did you get in here? We have access, it's a safe house. We're on our way to a funeral. I know that. There's been a change of plans. It's never easy to lament the passing of a soul I knew so well. Jim Boden was not just a loving husband to Rebecca and father to Courtney, but a friend to us all. Can we go inside already? Not until Agent Parker gives us the okay. We're literally missing the funeral. Just tryin' to keep you both safe. PASTOR: To everything there is a season - and a time... - Oh, heads up! PASTOR: Every purpose under the Heaven. A time to be born... Someone get me eyes on the tall woman with the hat that just sat in the back row. A time to plant, and a time to pluck off - that which was planted. - Bravo team? PASTOR: A time to kill... Alpha team, move around so you can get a line of sight. PASTOR: A time to break down. Stop touching your earpiece! PASTOR: And a time to laugh. A time to mourn and a time to dance. Something spooked her, go, go, go, go, go! All units, move in! PASTOR: Time to gather stones together. Get the family outta here right now! Copy that, proceeding to the safe house. Wait, what's happening? The site's been compromised, I'm moving you both to a secure location. He's here? Please keep your heads down. - Come with us right now. - What the hell? Secure her! (LAUGHING LOUDLY) Run rabbit, run! (INTENSE MUSIC) I need units on the I-95 Southbound past Junction 34 and backup northbound on 32 in case he tried to turn around. Where is my chopper? DISPATCHER: In route to your location. How are we doing on the I-95? DISPATCH: Southbound roadblock is in place. Northbound will be in two minutes. NATALIE: And where's my chopper? Nevermind, I see them. They can't be more than a mile ahead of us, dispatch. DISPATCH: Copy, relaying to pilot. Get outta the car! You got nowhere to go, Nicholas! Get out of the car! They made me do it! Get everyone back to the church right now! - Say it again, Monica? - Monica Mudd. Monica Mudd, okay. Just do it! It doesn't make sense! Let's go, let's go! On our way. Come back tomorrow, we're closed. (FEET STOMPING) (INTENSE MUSIC) My God! Not God, Father. Heaven is inevitable. What's the matter? You don't recognize me? 'Cause I know you know my wife. Oh! Jesus Christ. I now forgive your sins, my child. Why are you here? Because I made a list, and I checked it way more than twice. I was tryin' to find out who was naughty and who was nice. And you will never guess which one you are. (YELLS LOUDLY) Bullseye! I do hope you've said your prayers. (LAUGHS MANIACALLY) Jesus fucking Christ. This is getting outta control. He can't have got far. I'll get some roadblocks out. Yeah, I-95, gimme I-91 and I-87, barricades, roadblocks. DISPATCH: That's state's side. Yeah, that's right, I don't care if it's state's side! DISPATCH: You sure about that? Yes! DISPATCH: Copy that. We're dropping a 20 mile radius. You won't get him. Well, we got her, it's not all lost. She meant to get caught, meant to lead us away! She's only in cuffs 'cause she wants to be. So what's next? Where are the families? I agreed to be used as bait with the reassurance that I would be safe. You were safe at all times during the operation. It wasn't an operation, this was my dad's funeral! And why wasn't I informed it was gonna be hijacked? We only had 90 minutes notice that it might be used as a ploy to get Jennifer outta hiding. How do they even know that? We're not at liberty to say. What? Let's go in the office... No, we're gonna have this conversation right here. And they escaped? Okay, and your plan didn't even work. We need relocation. You're completely secure. We've got units posted from here on in. That didn't keep anyone safe last time. Why was my father's funeral being used as an FBI sting? Because your father was murdered. No, we were told that it was a drunk driving incident. No, it wasn't. Toxicology report says that it wasn't. The killers, they covered his body in alcohol so at first look, it made it look like it was. - Killers? - Yes, and yes. It's Nicholas Conway and Michelle Weaver. Ugh, this is so fucked up! Okay, we're leaving and we're not fuckin' coming back. We have Michelle in custody. And? Nicholas managed to escape. After he murdered Father Dermaid in the church, it appears he had been hiding in the building for the entire service. Michelle, she was just bait to lure us away from him. You two were never the intended targets for today. - Today? - Yes. We think he's on another spree. But we have all of our best criminal psychologists and Marshalls all over this. So, what are you doing? We're hunting him. Make no mistake, we are gonna catch him. We have Michelle in custody, we are two steps ahead of them, we have all of the full resources of the Bureau all over this. He's probably pretty worried right now. I don't think you understand him at all if you think he's worried about being caught. Well right now we need your help in under... Fuck you! Anything usable. They were never gonna be happy about this. They're both targets, so round the clock units all over them. Think they'll try again? Jennifer's his endgame, but hopefully he won't get that far. Where is she? She's downstairs. Interrogation room three is open if you wanna take her up there. No, let's go down there. Protocol. They're not playin' by the rules, so we need to unsettle her. You're the boss. I'm gonna go alone. Profile suggests that she's less likely to play mind games with a female. I'm Special Agent Natalie Parker, Miss Weaver. Is it okay if I call you Michelle? Or do you want me to call you Mrs. Claus? Are you the good cop? Is the bad cop comin' soon? I don't need to be good cop or bad. You're in a whole heap of trouble, Michelle. You can help yourself though. What do you think I'm doin'? What you did is obstruction and assisted manslaughter, but that already pales in comparison with the 19 counts of first degree murder you already have pending trial. (QUIETLY SHUSHING) You talk too much. Actions speak louder than words, is that it? True dat! But we won't have to wait that long. Daddy has a new plan. Of course he does. Not sure you actually know it, though. Well maybe I could prove it to you by tellin' you his whole plan, that way you believe me, and me and you can be BFFs forever. I know his plan. Or at least his end goal. To get back to his family, Lucy McKay and Jennifer. That's what he wants, to be reunited with them. You, you don't think he actually loves you, do you? I mean, I'm sure he fucked you a couple of times and said he did, but then why is he hellbent on getting back to another woman? You really are a dimwit, Agent Natalie Parker. Special Agent. Do I strike you as the jealous type? No, but you strike me as the stupid type if you're gonna help your psycho Santa get back to the woman he actually loves. Sorry. I was just seein' if I could get to you. Didn't quite know if you were close enough. But back to your strategic approach, yes, he loves me, only me. And when we kill everyone else in that room, I'm gonna keep you alive. Strip tease you bare naked in front of him and then you'll know, it's me that's most likely to fuck your brains out. They're gonna throw away the key. Call me. - You okay? - Yeah. But we're not gonna get anything from her no matter how much we do that. We can find out what she wants. She doesn't want a deal. People like these two can't be bought. Well, I know somebody that might be able to help. - You should talk to him. - Who? So up to the housetop, the coursers they flew, with the sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too. And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof, the prancing and pawing of each little hoof. Just like Rudolph's hoof. Yeah, his red hoofs! As I drew on my head and was turning around, down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot. (LIGHT KNOCKING) There's someone at the door sweetie, I'll just go check. You stay here, okay? It's a bit late. Sheriff Mitchell? Not Sheriff anymore. May name is... Sandy, you wanna go read in your room? Who's that lady? She's not gonna be staying long, then I'll come up and read you a story. - Is that okay? - Okay. My granddaughter. She's beautiful. Look, I'm not interested in any book or movie deal you're trying to sell. I'm with the Bureau. I'm with the AA. I see. My meetings are probably going better than your manhunt. I need your help. At least you're brave enough to admit it. It'll be Christmas related. What? How he's choosing them. - Maybe not this time. - Always. Three attacks, one he let live, two he killed. All connected with Courtney. The father, the therapist, the local priest, all tryin' to flush out Jennifer. There's something missing here. It's gotta be related to Christmas. He's leaving naughty or nice labels at each crime scene. Well there you go. But, it all ties back to Jennifer, right? I'm gonna beat this guy. Let me tell ya something about Nick Conway. He's equal part crazy and smart. And don't underestimate the lengths he'll go for an end goal that you might not even understand. He burnt down that whole asylum, he killed 30 people. He pulled out his own teeth so he could be declared dead in that fire, all to cover his tracks. And he still waited three years to come back to Woodridge for Jennifer. He bided his time, he made his plan. And the reason that he's better than us at it is because he's willing to be killed or to die for it. Help me. Just take a look. I don't do that anymore. One look. Lady, if I wanna see the horrors he and that crazy girl committed all I have to do is close my eyes and look back on that day where they murdered half this God damn town. We don't have a lot of Christmas fanfare these days. You mighta noticed. I'd be willing to bet it's gonna take three generations for this place to forget what happened here. You know why that is, Sheriff? Because he killed so many. No. Because they haven't been brought to justice. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Hello? This is private property. I'm a federal agent with the FBI. Well I apologize, but this is still private property and what the hell are you doing here? Looking for some information about some former patients. Well all the patient records were burned in the fire that closed this place down. You would remember these two. Nick Conway and Michelle Weaver. Yeah, I remember them. You meet a lot of troubled people here, but that guy, he was just evil incarnate. You worked here then? I used to be an orderly, just keepin' the patients in line really. The other company closed down and kept me on to take care of the grounds, keep the local kids out, things like that Just until we sell the place, or they turn it in to fancy apartments. Not long then and I'll have my pension. What can you tell me about the fire? (GLASS CLANKING) (FIRE WOOSHING) Look, you have to understand that those two aren't normal. The had respect for nothing. They were violent, they were crude, and they were dangerous. When the hospital was in trouble and we needed to take a stronger line... Results, doctor. Immediately. You're making a mistake. Am I? It was all chaos. And I thought they died, and I was lucky to get out on my own. You ever beat any of the patients? It was part of the program. And it was kinder than electric shock treatment! And those two just weren't right in the head! Well, it didn't work. Look, we had minimal self defense training And we had to deal with some of the most dangerous criminally insane people in the country. You let crazies like him or her come at you, you needed to put them down, and put them down hard. You let them get up again and they're going to kill you. Now do you think I was wrong to deal with them like that? I don't know what I think. Well I think the devil is capable of a lot of things, especially if he has some helping hands. And I'll tell you this, a lot of good people died here that day. And if I could go back in time, knowing what I know now, I would beat him to death, right here on his floor. You mind if I take a look around? Not without a search warrant. Thank you for your help, sir. You're most welcome. Here's my number. If you think of anything else you think might be pertinent, please call me. - If I do, I will. - Thanks. And I hope you catch them. Jim was a good guy. Jim? Jim Boden? Yeah. How do you know him? Well he used to work here, same as me. Really? Look, this isn't the big city, Agent Parker, it's a small town. Half the families who lived here at some time or another, probably worked here. Thanks again. JACK: Boss, how was the nut house? Yeah, good, but Jim Boden used to work for the asylum. Well that explains one thing, then. NATALIE: What? I talked to his wife about the unusual route he took home. Remember, he got off the highway two exits early. His wife said he always used to do that and drive the back roads by the asylum as it's the way that he knew, so it's nothing more than habit. No, Jack it was more than that. That may have been habit for him but then our two Christmas freaks somehow knew that because they chose the location to ambush him. Think it's related? Filled in some details, but I'm not sure we're any closer yet. How's the woman in red? Don't worry about her, she's secure. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Yeah, Parker, it's Sheriff, it's Mitchell here. I've been goin' over those notes you left. Now, clearly the killers used Courtney's father to flush Courtney, lead you to Jennifer. It looks like Jennifer is what it's based around but the priest doesn't connect to her. And his killing won't have been random, they leave people alive for a reason, that's the same way they kill 'em. There's a connection between the targets, too. You said he's been marking them with naughty and nice. Just like the song. What if it's an actual list? (DIAL TONE BEEPING) Hello, hello? Drop the ax! Drop it! Season's greetings, Sheriff Mitchell. On your knees! This is Sheriff Mitchell as 1911 Gale Drive. In self defense, I just shot and killed an intruder on my property. Send the police. Oh wow, operating a murder, Sheriff Mitchell, maybe you and I aren't so different after all. Shooting a rabid dog to keep it from hurting anyone else is not murder, it's a kindness! You should watch your back, Sheriff, I don't work alone, remember? And I know your partner's in lock up, spilling her guts to the feds. And where's your partner? (LAUGHS SOFTLY) Oh, that's right, he's not here! You remember him? I think he's spread over a wide area right about now! - (LAUGHS LOUDLY) - Shut up! Oh, you would've heard the noises he made. The crying, the screaming, it was humiliating! You shut your mouth! You know what? Just before I think I took his heart out, I think he pissed himself and he shat himself... I said shut up! I don't care how you're choosing your victims. This time, you're not gonna get away with just an arrest. I'm gonna make sure no one on your list is harmed. - Do it! - This is what has to be done. Do it! (GUN CLICKING) Oh dear! Whoops. I don't need a gun for you. Come on! Come on! You can't kill me! Oh, Mitchell, I killed you five minutes ago. I just wanted to watch. (LAUGHS MANIACALLY) Excuse you? Whoo, cheers! But before you die, Sheriff Mitchell, that generosity, all that protection you thought you gave her is gonna mean nothing, because I'm gonna find her. You hear me? I'm gonna find her! What on Earth is that? You got a house guest, Mitchell? Somebody I should say merry Christmas to? Look at you! Look at you! You're like all old folks, it's the drink that killed you in the end. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Santa, is that you? Uh huh. Have you been a good girl? Yes. What's your name? Sandy. Sandy, wow, what a beautiful name. How old are you, Sandy? Six. So young, so unaware of how precarious life can be. But why should you have to pay for the sins of your grandfather when you're so nice? Can I talk to you for a second? I wanna look in to the local asylum more. I think there could be something there that helps us understand this. That's just gonna be malpractice, I'm not sure how it affects the here and now. It's an important part of the puzzle. Oh and, get a local unit to check on Sheriff Mitchell. I left him a voicemail, but I can't get through to him. Make sure they check the local bar as well as his home. Copy that. (PHONE RINGING) (DIAL TONE BEEPING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I'm Santa's helper! Where's her mother? On her way, she spent the weekend out of town. He dressed her like that, so we're waiting on the doc to examine whether or not he did anything else to her. Not his style. - You sure? - Yeah. Not that kinda criminal. Well, Agent Parker, you were right. This guy isn't about the money, he can't be bought. And we can't predict what he's gonna do next. JACK: You okay? Yeah. JACK: I am sorry. You were right. That's not very comforting. I was right about us underestimating him. This doesn't fit any profile. Yeah, which makes it that much more difficult for us to predict his next move. What about Mitchell? Voicemail he left me, all he said was that it's an actual list, that's it. Well we've already cross-referenced everyone and so far there's no one that is connected. So if there is a link, we just can't see it. He said it was an actual list. So? Like it already exists. I don't follow. The list is not a connection we need to find, this list, it already exists. Keep searching, maybe they all have the same internet provider or bank at the same bank. Maybe they went to the same book club or went to the same high school and ran track. Somewhere out there is a list that exists with all of their names on it. Find it. Hello? Hello? Hello? This is private property, and I've got a gun! So if you want a place to get high, this isn't it. What the hell is all this? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LAUGHS LOUDLY) What did I do? (SCREAMING LOUDLY) Fight! I made a list, and you're on it! You're gonna wanna see this. (SCREAMING LOUDLY) You've been a naughty boy! Who's on my list! (LAUGHS MANIACALLY) Shit. Fuck me. Secure the other room. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) It's time. Are we definitely doing this? Do you wanna continue living in fear? Then what choice do we have? What are you two planning? We're going to my uncle Tom's for the night. He's away for the evening and it's only 10 minutes down the road. So, we'll take my FBI escort and patch things up with my old friend. We'll have our escort here with you, everyone will be safe and watched. Okay, but please, both of you, be careful. We will. I love you. I love you too, mom. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Jack, get forensics in here with an infrared lamp. What are we lookin' for? There was something here, he took it, but it looks A4 shaped. A4 shaped? Yeah, everything else here is a picture, but what was here he thought was worth taking and not letting us find. Could be a list. List of what? Victims. Sheriff Mitchell mentioned a reference to that naughty or nice song. Maybe it's an actual list, meaning that the victims might actually be connected in a way that has nothing to do with Jennifer. So what're we hopin' forensics will find? White paper with black text and a strong light in front of it, it may have actually produced some image burn transfer on the wall. It's impossible to see with the naked eye but I have seen it done. Okay, on it. Why don't you make this easy on yourself and tell us where he is? You know a judge is gonna look favorably on you if you help us. You already have all the clues. It's up to you to step back and see the whole picture. You hungry? Nah, I had razorblades for breakfast, baby. You swallowed razorblades today, is that a joke? (LAUGHS SOFTLY) Could be. Is it a joke? Nah, death is pretty certain. You'll never get what you want if I bleed out, right? Nobody's that fuckin' crazy. You're just gonna have to find out. Shit. I need an ambulance. Transport one at a top security protocol? Who is she? She's the real deal, rookie. Bob, don't worry about it, you'll be just fine. We'll be leadin' the way, you'll have Jensen with you the whole time. So, how long? What? How long you been outta the academy? It's my first week. Look, most of the time these guys don't give us any trouble. In fact, they're already in a while heap of trouble. Any disruption on their part's gonna screw up the plea bargain they're tryin' to work out to save their ass. What about the rest of them? Huh? You said most of the time. - Oh. - What about her? Well, yeah, more than likely, she's the exception to the rule. She doesn't want or need a plea bargain and now apparently she swallowed razorblades to avoid betraying her husband. And who's that? Santa Claus. What did she do? They killed 30 people in some little town - upstate New York. - 30 people? Why? To flush out his daughter in some sick game. Jesus. You're going to be okay. Don't let her get inside your head. And shoot first if she tries anything. We don't want her to get a fair trial? People like her really don't need a trial. I just don't wanna make a mistake. You won't. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) DISPATCH: Transport one, be advised, blizzard weather alert in your area. Proceed with caution. TRANSPORT OFFICER: Copy that, dispatch, proceeding with caution. So we agree, one present each, just one, so I get her one. Christmas morning comes, wouldn't you know, what do you think she's doing? She got you more than one. She got me more than one. Seven. Meantime, my one present to her was right there beneath the tree. That's awful of her. This year, you need to get backup presents. Yeah, right! Wait, what the hell is that? Somebody broke down? Hold up there transport one, we've got something ahead of us. DISPATCH: Transport one, please advise. Federal agents, clear the road. Why are they stopping? Somebody's on the road. DISPATCH: Transport one, what's the hold up? Dispatch, we got a pedestrian in the road clearing it now, be back moving in two minutes. You wanna do it? It's cold! Transport one, please describe. Describe? JACK: Is the individual in question wearing a Santa suit? How did she know that? Dispatch, confirmed. We're just about to go and clear him now. Tell them to run him over. Let's try taking him alive. Tell, run him over. Let him go! Dispatch, say again? Run him over! Transport one, if you do not run him over, - you're all dead! - Is she serious? You're in so much trouble. NATALIE: Transport one, do you copy? That was an order! Let him go, freak. Daddy wouldn't like you calling me that. (NICHOLAS LAUGHING LOUDLY) Transport one, do you copy! Let him go! Transport one, be advised, local law is on route, hold your position. It's coming! (LAUGHS LOUDLY) What the fuck? Fuck! (TREE CRASHING) No! (LAUGHING LOUDLY) JACK: Agent Johnson, what's going on over there? Did you break down? TRANSPORT OFFICER: Standby for this channel. We are under attack, send help! Agents are down, agents are down! Pandora is outta the box. Repeat, pandora is outta the box. We are under attack. The assailant is dressed as Santa Claus. No, oh god, no, no! Stay out there, okay? I got your friend! Don't come in here, I'm armed! (LOUD KNOCKING) (GUNFIRE POPPING) (BONES CRUNCHING) There's my Mrs. Claus. There you are! (LAUGHS LOUDLY) Have you been a good girl? I've been a little bit naughty. Me too. Come on. (LOUD THUDDING) This is dispatch. I need ambulance and law enforcement to County Road 9, 15 miles east of Woodridge. Do you copy? Do you copy? You know what? Don't bother. They're all dead. Hey. JACK: Where are you? Something wasn't sitting right about the murder of Becky Mudd and her boyfriend so I came to have another look at the bodies. JACK: It bothered me too. Biting anyone's throat out like a wild animal just shows what they're capable of. No, it's not how she died, it's that every other victim so far has had either naughty or nice carved into them or the message has been left at the crime scene. Not in this case. JACK: Maybe he was rushed. But we know he wasn't. They had the whole night at the house before Doctor Mudd drove the decoy car. JACK: So what's the significance? I think it's a list. Like an actual list. JACK: I don't follow We've been assuming that they are picking targets that are connected to Jennifer and then deciding whether they were naughty or nice. JACK: Which they are. Becky Mudd wasn't connected to anyone, she was wrong place, wrong time. JACK: He still killed her and her boyfriend. But didn't label them. This list, I think it's an actual physical thing that they've been sticking to as a rule. It's not something they're making up as they go along. The names, the targets, they've all been preset. So I don't think it's as random as we thought it was. Natalie, you're right. About the list and the infrared light showing up heat transfer. Forensics hit a partial on a piece of A4 paper, it's a list of names. Who's on it? The priest, Sheriff Mitchell, Jim Boden, Clint Wiseman, and a bunch of other names. Bryce, Stranson, Mangard, they're all on the board of BioCorp. I thought I recognized the names from looking in to the company because of the connections to this place. The priest didn't work here, but he did provide patients with confession so made the corporate Christmas card list. Jesus, so that's why we couldn't find a link. I know who directs the police, but were involved in the running which supplied this place. Send units out to everyone on that list. I think they're gonna ramp this up because it's Christmas Eve. Got it. With our cost efficiency programs fully implemented, we have managed to drop running costs across the board by 15%, and increase our profits to a record $1.3 billion, but we can do better. This coming year we'll be rolling out our cost efficiency protocols to every single site we own, meaning we will reduce our costs by 50% and double our profits. I'm also very pleased to announce that Senator Williams will be joining the board this coming fall shortly after retiring from U.S. politics. This will also come shortly after we win a very lucrative care contract with the U.S. government to provide medical services. These two incidents are not entirely unconnected. (EVERYONE LAUGHING) I really should thank our lawyer, Nathaniel, for landing us this particularly juicy and lucrative whale. You're most welcome, the invoice is in the post. (EVERYONE LAUGHING) I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Excuse me. That was, I must say, a particularly expensive round of golf for the U.S. government. (EVERYONE LAUGHING) What did you come as? The ghost of Christmas ass? (BOTH LAUGHING) Please tell me you work here. Wearin' a suit, peeing in the executive washroom on the 32nd floor, I don't work here, pal. I'm on the board. But what's the name? Nathaniel Collins, from Collins, Davis, and Bathers. Look me up sometime. But use your good eye. (BOTH LAUGHING) (SCREAMING LOUDLY) (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) What a prick! (LAUGHS LOUDLY) Mrs. Claus, come and look at this! (LAUGHS LOUDLY) Can I ask something, Paul? Yes, of course, Marie. As a company committed to caring for the mentally ill, did the cost cutting have any affect on the quality of the care the customers received? You mean the patients? Well, they are our customers. I think you'll find the majority of our bills are paid for by the medical insurance industry and the U.S. government. The patients are actually a very small part of the process. Nevertheless, it is the service we're providing. And our patients receive the very best possible care. According to who, Paul? Well I'm very glad you asked, actually, Marie, because our legal department have just come up with an extremely watertight definition of what constitutes good patient care. I'll be happy to get them to explain it to you. Perhaps Nathaniel could. In fact, where has he gone? (BOARD MEMBERS SCREAM LOUDLY) There he is. Or at least the part you'll remember about him. This is a private meeting. Well I know I'm not on your list, but let me tell you something, you're all on mine. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. And I'm gonna have to ask you to shut the fuck up, Paul! Or I'm gonna kill you all very fucking slowly! Security. (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) Needless to say, Paul, security will not be joining us. You're insane! (LAUGHING LOUDLY) Well of course we are, Paul! Me and my lovely wife. But you know what the real kicker is? You'll never guess which company is responsible for our medical care! I remember you! Courtney. That was a bad move on your part. Awe, he remembers us, I feel so special. Look, I had to do what I did back then, you're a psychopath, you have to understand this! Now I'm in a position of power, I'm able to help people like you. I can help you get the treatment that you deserve. Oh, that is so noble. And I hope you get everything you want for Christmas. But before that, you'll need to help me with something. Who was that that just got stabbed at the door? That's Roger Smithson. Ah, Roger Smithson, one less person on the list! (LAUGHS LOUDLY) I've called the police while sitting here, they're on the way. My, my, that's very honest, Mrs.? Marie Thompson. Marie Thompson. You know, that genuine honesty, along with your care of the patients, that might be just enough to get you to the nice side of this list. What do you want? To work through my list. Your list? (LAUGHS) You know what, it's actually your list. It's a BioCorp Christmas card list! And you're all on it! (LAUGHS LOUDLY) We're not afraid of you! Well you know what? You really, really should be, because in about five minutes, every single person in this room might be dead. Daddy! Yes, Mr. Claus? When's the fun gonna start? Soon. Be quick! I wanna fuck before the finale! (LAUGHS LOUDLY) Wives can be so demanding. Shoo, Mrs. Claus. I haven't decided who I'm gonna slay first. Yes you have. Well obviously, you're a front runner, Paul, but I do like the way a woman screams. It gets my blood boiling, you know? Tell me, if I kill you all, is BioCorp dead? Is the company shut down? No, if you kill everyone here, then the shareholders will just appoint a new board. You'll make this all pointless. Well that is interesting, Paul. What happens if I kill all but one of you, then? Well if you kill all but one, then they will by default become the CEO. That doesn't help then, because no everyone is here, Paul. Where is Tom Bolond? He's in hospital. He's having his appendix removed. Which hospital? If I tell you, will you let me live? Just you, Paul? I mean all of us, let all of us live. Oh no, no, no, no, no, Paul! No, no, no, no, no. You all heard that, Paul was negotiating just for himself there, remember that, people. He would negotiate for himself 10,000 times over before he considered anybody but himself! Listen to me you freak! You're not gonna bully or intimidate us! You're a nut job! There's no point in anything you're doing here. So either kill us or get the hell out! Because I'm not gonna give the satisfaction to a piece of shit like you of me begging for my life! Oh, wow! Wow, I mean, I, I really dug that speech. I mean, you've got bite and backbone and I like that in a woman. Here's that address. Do me a favor, Marie. Be a better CEO than him. (PAIR LAUGHING) (BOARD MEMBERS SCREAMING) (CALM JAZZ MUSIC) (BOARD MEMBERS SCREAMING) (BONES CRUNCHING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Whew! Merry Christmas!(LAUGHS EVILLY) (PHONE RINGING) NATALIE: Lucy? Hey, everything all right? Yeah, just doing some safe protocol stuff. We're gonna move you for a couple nights. Why? Just precautionary and making it last minute means no one knows. More people have died, haven't they? Just pack some things, please. Okay, I'll head home now, but I've gotta wait for Jennifer to get back. Where is she? With Courtney, visiting her uncle. Her uncle? What's his name? Tom Boland, he's a family friend. And she's with her FBI escort. Okay, I'm gonna send a unit to you now and I'm gonna pick you both up. (KNOCKING LOUDLY) Uncle Tom! Courtney and Jennifer! How are you? What are you doing here? Just driving by. Do you mind if we come in for a minute? Well sure, do your folks know you're here? It's Christmas Eve, don't you kids have some place better to be? Nope, we are exactly where we should be. How are you? Your father was a good man. I know. I was sorry to hear what happened. Thank you. You were the one who gave my dad a job at the asylum, right? Yeah, but that was years ago. It was just an orderly job, but he was family, and that's the most important thing, right? Speaking of which, shouldn't you be at home with your mom? It's Christmas Eve. Yeah. Here's the thing, she's safer than you are. That's why we're here. What? What's going on? Show time. Hey. I can't get through to Jennifer's security detail, can you try them? Yeah, sure. Anything on the names? Yeah, and there's somethin' else. He killed 11 of the 13 names about an hour ago downtown. All the remaining names are board members as far as I can see. So he left two alive? Mmm, one at the scene, Marie Thompson, she got marked as nice. So who's the last name? Tom somethin'. Thomas Boland? Yeah, that could be it. How the hell did you know that? 'Cause that's where Jennifer and Courtney are right now. Get me the address and get everyone there. Jesus, push my emergency button! They won't make it in time. My FBI escort is outside. All dead, I'm assuming. Call the police! No one is coming. (NICHOLAS LAUGHS QUIETLY) Very good, young Courtney. Perhaps you were right about her, Mrs. Claus. (GIGGLES EXCITEDLY) We have a deal. Yes, we do. What? This only ever ends when he gets you. I'm sorry, Jen, but my life is fucked up enough because of you and it ends here. You bitch! (NICHOLAS AND MICHELLE LAUGH) So? So you were never on the list, Courtney. You're free to go. And my uncle too? Wasn't part of my deal. But he's part of my family! Don't overstep your mark, and don't tell me about the value of family until you have lost all of yours! So you're just gonna leave me? I never had a choice. What happened to being friends? I like life a little bit too much, okay? And I want mine back, and I am taking my uncle! You'll regret underestimating me. I should've done this ages ago. If you leave me, you better hope he kills me, 'cause I will hunt you down and kill you, Courtney! Don't be upset, baby girl. I know what it's like to have somebody you love turn their back on you. But daddy's here to make amends. Mrs. Claus. Happy hunting. I thought you'd never ask, baby! Wait, why? You made a deal with her for me. A promise to a liar is no promise at all, baby girl. There's my baby girl. (PHONE RINGING) NATALIE: Talk to me! JACK: The lines are all dead. Who's the closest? - You are. - Right. Wait for backup, Natalie. You know I can't. Natalie? Natalie, Natalie! Hold her here. What's going on? Hold her here. What? I gotta go back for Jen. But I thought you betrayed her. That's what we wanted them to think. Family, Jennifer, it's the only thing that will love you. I'm the only thing you'll kill to protect. I'm not sure. About what? That you fully understood how important friends can be. Mrs. Claus? She's got a gun to her head. Do you know what a safety catch looks like? (GIGGLES) Clever girls. Shut up! You know what? I couldn't be prouder right now. I've seen my baby girl reach her full potential. I'm a proud father. I shouldn't have hesitated, I should've killed you! Yes you should've! But guess what baby girl? You've got another chance. Shoot me, and you know what happens then, baby. When you take your first life, you become just like me. She's nothing like you. She has friends. Oh yeah? Well why don't you be a good friend, Courtney, and kill me for her. What? What did you forget I killed your father? You know, he squealed like a pig when I cut him open, so do it for your friend! Gimme the fucking gun, Jennifer. No, it has to be me. Why? Why baby, what does it have to be you? Because you have a killer instinct inside here, haven't ya? It's just bottling up inside you, and under all that moral and pretense, there's nothing but a killer! And I can't wait to see her! Put it down, Jennifer, we've got him! Don't listen to her. Put it down, Jennifer! I can't! If he dies, this all dies too. No, we're gonna lock him up and throw away the key. - He will escape! - Yes I will. - He won't! - Yes I will! Do it, Jennifer. Put a fucking bullet through his brain. Listen to her, c'mon. Don't! I got to you before, Jennifer, I'll get to you again! Jennifer, I cannot allow you to shoot him. Shoot me and all is forgiven. Do it! Kill the fucking bastard, Jennifer! You know what, maybe I am like you. Jennifer, lower the gun. Don't make me do this. Do it! - Put it down, Jennifer! - Do it, Jennifer, do it! Fucking kill him! (GUN BANGS) - No! - Jennifer! No, no, no! Get him outta here! - No! - Get him outta here! What did you do? I don't think this is quite the grotto you were hoping you'd be sat in on Christmas day. Christmas isn't over yet. Must be tough, being double-crossed by someone you love. I've never been prouder as a father. It's over, you lost. (CHUCKLES QUIETLY) Oh, no, Agent Parker, you lost. And my little girl nearly won. You should've let her kill me when you had the chance. You won't get it again. That's a mistake you and the man before you made. For my little girl, she's smart. So smart. She knew that what was needed here was good, old fashioned revenge, not justice. How long do you think it's gonna be before my Mrs. comes to get me? That's very modern of you, letting us poor girls come rescue you big, tough guys. Oh, she's smart, Agent Parker. Smarter than you. She knows this building, she's been in this cell. She knows how to break out. She knows your routines. But you know what she really, really hates? Any woman that stands directly between me and her. I'm sorry, I lied to you before. About what? I am the jealous type. (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (FLOURISHING MUSIC)
