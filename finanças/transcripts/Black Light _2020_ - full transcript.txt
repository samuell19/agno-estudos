BLACK LIGHT Miss? Last stop. Aren't you getting off? Doesn't this go to Chang-jin Terminal? You didn't know it's been relocated? Please get off. It's been a while since you worked here. Why'd you quit last time? I quit as I got married. You're married? Do you have kids? No. Planning? Maybe I shouldn't ask. Anyway, the boss said to make sure you adjust here well. He's not one to see to the staff. He must've favored you. Not really. It's because I called and asked. You've worked here before, you'll be fine. You can start on Monday. Let's greet the others. Thank you. - You're staying in our residence? - Yes. The secretary will direct you. The rooms are meant for two, but you can use it alone. You know the basics. Work in Line 2 as before. She used to work here 5 years ago. Anyone remember her? - We've been here less than 5 years. - Right. She knows the ropes around here. Please help her adjust. I'll work hard. Nice to meet you. Welcome. How about a big hand? Hee-ju? It is you! You still work here? How've you been? It's been so long. What brings you here? I came back to work here. Really? Are you okay now? I will be. Good. That's the spirit. Is it okay for you to be here? Why? It's nothing. It's nice to see you again. This, too? It's not broken. Just throw it out. Learn to let go. Let's make a fresh start at our new place. Why hang on to old stuff? But we can't throw everything away. - My little sister! - Hey. It was a long trip, huh? It wasn't so bad. How've you been? You look much healthier. I'm embarrassed to show you this mess. It must be hard getting ready to move. There is so much to throw out in this old house. Where are your belongings? I left them at the residence. What residence? Why do you want to live there? It's not as bad as you think. Still. You can stay here. Why go there? She wants to live there. Don't burden her. Right? Dear? Help me over here? Brother? Where is my stuff? In that box. Hee-ju? What should we do with this? Hey! Why are you so startled? How've you been? Where were you? At my aunt's house. You should've told me. My caf√© is down that way. It's not far. Hee-ju! Where are you going? NAM-GIL The nurse asked when you'd come, Mom. Who? The head nurse. Is it about money? No. But accounting was here, too. Next time, tell them to come when I'm here. Take these and put 'em in the freezer. Go on. Bye. You've been with us for over a year, right? Yes. And he's been like that for 2 years. Is something wrong? Well... Any thoughts on moving him? Why? Move him to where? It's affiliated with our hospital. It's new and nice there. It's not as crowded as it is here. Take him to a care home for what? I recommend you take care of him in a more comfortable environment. What about his treatments? You mean we should just watch and wait for him to die? Why isn't he getting medication? Are you treating him at all? You know very well. There's nothing we can do but wait till he gains consciousness. It could take a while. Please read this? Excuse me! Wait. Young-nam! Young-nam! I'd like to quit. Why so suddenly? Did you tell the boss I started working? No, not yet. Let's say I never started. Why? Is something wrong? It's not that. Hi. Please sit and wait for me. Don't mind me. I'll wait. What's wrong, Hee-ju? You just started. Why would you quit? Is the work hard? Is someone bothering you? I'll tell you later. Hee-ju? Hee-ju! Have you eaten? You started here yesterday? The work is hard, isn't it? You'll get used to it soon. Do you... know me? Pardon? Do you know... who I am? I saw you back in the office. Sorry... Excuse me. Bring out some liquor. You already had a drink. It's been a while since I had a drink with Hee-ju. Okay, fine. Why aren't you eating? I am. Eat up. It's our last time eating under the moonlight. We can't when we move. Did you meet them? Who? The other party. Why would I? It's all over. Shouldn't I meet them? Why? For what? Cut the nonsense and eat. I should go and apologize for... For what! Why are you sorry? We agreed to 100% at fault, and the insurance paid them. Your husband died, but at least he's alive! We did what we could. Drop the nonsense! Don't ever bring it up again. Got that? Don't sleep here. It looks like we're not busy. Why'd you run away from the crosswalk yesterday? Is it because of the woman on the other side? Who is she? The wife of the man my husband struck. Did she threaten you? I don't think she knows me. I look 10 years younger, don't I? Looks great! I told you she's good. - She used to run a hair salon. - Really? That's why. Why move away from your hometown? For a bigger hospital. And my husband worked here. So you moved here with your daughter? You're lucky. You owe me. Hi. Yes, she's here. Really? Go quickly. He's not well. We'd better go. Not much to eat? We met before. I work here. Is there something you want from me? No, not really... You're Sun-woo's wife, right? Wait. Nam-gil is my husband. Shouldn't you see a doctor? I'm okay, Miss. I'm the girl who went to your house yesterday. What is it? Are you home? Why do you ask? I left something at your place. Left what? I'm not home now. I'm outside your door. Could you tell me your code? I'm sorry. I fell asleep. How'd you know my number? The security guard told me. He said to call. Wait. Do you know who I am? Yes. Who? You work at the factory with my mom. I saw you in the cafeteria. My mom works there. Do you know my mom? No. Found what you came for? I think I lost it. What is it? Miss? By chance... Do you have any food? Thank you very much. Did you tell your mom? About what? That you're here. She's too busy to care. Is this your hometown? No, I moved here. Why? For my dad's treatments. Want some rice? Miss? May I ask you a favor? Done with the insurance company? Not yet. They're checking on something. Why? Is there a problem? I'm not sure what it is. You called me to ask that? Lunch is almost over. Our office folks pitched in. They're all worried. Suddenly? Since when? You know I'm worried about him. You are? That's why I made sure you can work here. This is not from the company. It's a gift from the family here. Why didn't you show you cared before? NEW DRIVER It's okay. I'll do it. I can do it. But aren't you using this? No. It's your car. Take it. We have the shop van. - I should've washed it. - It's okay. I'll be going then. Bye. Sure you're okay to drive? Please don't tell my brother. I won't. I know he won't like you driving. He's over-protective. He's worried for a reason. He stays up nights worrying about you. I know. No, you don't. I think I do. Then you won't do this. Did you wait long? No. Do you know the way? If I get close to it... Want some candy? No, it's okay. But it's good. You said you knew. It has to be here. Did you see a leaning tree on the way? How can I tell? There are trees everywhere. That one is unique. We passed it. Let's go back a bit. Are you crying? It's here. Dad's car accident was here. Actually, it wasn't an accident. Dad tried to get killed. He caused the accident to kill himself. Come on! Hurry! Grab his legs. One, two, three! Where were you? Thank you. Why leave him like that? Miss Hee-ju? Miss. Wait. Listen. Do you know who he is? That man... He killed my husband. Pardon? Please reinvestigate. There's been a mistake. What mistake? The wrong man is at fault. The accident's investigation is over. It's an incident, not an accident. The other man crossed the centerline, not my husband! We don't make conclusions on a whim, ma'am. It's done thoroughly and scientifically. But it was wrong. Look here. This is your car. This is the other car. They were in opposite lanes. They came like this and this one crossed the line and hit this car. He didn't cross the centerline. Please listen. The car swirled 40 degrees and stopped here. This car was stopped by the guardrail. How do we know? By their locations after the impact. They're undeniable facts. We saw it and so did the family members. We can tell how the cars came to stop like that through simulations. We know how the car moved to end up like that. You didn't say anything back then. Why raise questions now? I'm back. What are you doing? Organizing. Heat up the soup and eat. Why throw out Dad's clothes! I'm not. Then what are you doing? I'm giving it to a friend's son to wear in the winter. Why give Dad's clothes away? What will he wear? He can't wear them now. I'll buy him new clothes later. What's with you! Tell them to buy clothes! Why take someone else's? Are they bums? Don't say that. Fine, I won't give it to them. Don't shove them in like that! What did the doctor say? About what? How's Dad's status? He's getting better. We'll have to wait. You're lying. He's not getting any better! How can you tell? Don't worry. He'll be fine soon. He wasn't fine before. Aren't you curious? Why he drove that day? What? Isn't it weird? What's weird about him driving? It's not weird at all. Go to your room! Stop bothering me! No surveillance cameras. No dash cams... She's over there. Call me at this number. Please don't go to the chief. Follow me. Your husband's car came from that way. Then it... Jeez! What's that? Damn. It's a deer. It's a fawn. - Who do we call? - County office? Tell them to remove it. How about telling the herbal clinic? Great idea. Ask for some antler extract in exchange. Yes, sir. Wait! There. He crossed the line and hit the other car. Sir? It's not here, but down there. What? No, I'm right. - Did you take the pictures properly? - Look here. It can't be... It came this way... Jeez. The car stopped here. The first collision was there. Then it skidded about 6 meters and stopped beside the guardrail. The report said that his car hit the guardrail. Why leave that out? It was written prior to the full investigation. If you look at the final report... The first witness should know. It was rewritten, wasn't it? No, it was not. How can you say that? If not, was the witness crazy and said it hit the guardrail? We checked several times, but there was no proof. What proof? If you look at the final report, it's all written here. It's already corrected here. Explain to me why it's changed. I explained to you. Get the car. You're saying the culprit has been switched? Look at the first report. It said the other car hit the guardrail and stopped. What does that change? If it hit it, the simulation that the cops speak of is wrong. The car that crossed the centerline changes. Why would Nam-gil cross the centerline? Why the hell would my husband do it? Why did you come here? The boss told me to. Can't I come? Hee-ju. They're suffering, too. Must you do this? He killed an innocent man, but he's alive! You pity them? This won't bring the dead back. The case is closed. Must you do this to a dying man? Why do you take their side? You're irrelevant to this. Please stop meddling. It's my job, too. We're all family. They're not my family. I'll work again. I'm not running away. Oh my. Did you know there's no toxicology report? I heard they couldn't check because the blood clotted. The other guy too? He didn't die. I heard they agreed not to do it out of fairness. Really? I see. There are some suspicious areas in the report. Why admit to his fault off the bat? Why didn't you ask for a reinvestigation then? I wasn't here. My brother took care of it. I see. It's been a while. It'll be hard to prove. You claim it wasn't an accident, right? He caused it on purpose. To kill himself? That's harder to prove. Suicides are hard to prove with data alone. Proof of setting up insurance right before would help. We need to show how he felt like his motives and circumstances. What makes you claim he caused it on purpose? I heard it. From who? Someone close to the other family? I can't tell you that. I see. I understand for now. I'll check on the insurance and highway management. Let's try it. - What are you up to? - What? Digging up the past won't do you any good! This isn't over. Hee-ju! When will you stop? You should move on and live like a human! You're saying I'm not human? A lawyer? I'm going to cancel it now. No! Stop it! Let go. Stop it! Let go! Stop! Please. Let me go. Why do you get to decide? Stop acting like a parent! Stay out of this. I'll take care of my business. Fine. Hee-ju. Open the door. Open the door! Hee-ju! He needs to be stable! Move, please. He hurt his head. 1000 DAYS ACCIDENT-FREE ACHIEVED! Young-nam! Why are you avoiding me? We're not enemies. I have nothing to say. I'm worried. Is Nam-gil doing well? How could he be well? Young-nam. I had no idea. I should've taken care of him. I'm sorry. Why would you be sorry? No one did anything wrong. Don't say that to me. Nam-gil will wake up. He's not one to die and leave his family. I know that well. How can you say that when I don't even know? Forget about us and take care of your family. And please stop doing that. No one will notice anyway. Please don't bother. Please have some. They're really good. I have to go. Save 'em for your daughter. Here. It's good antler extract. Please stop bringing stuff like this. It's not for him. I brought it for you. I've seen many get sick from taking care of patients. Thank you. I still feel terrible. What if he is like this because we didn't deal with the scene fast enough. I don't think that at all, so please don't. Anyway, he looks much better. He's the same. No, he's not. You may not notice, seeing him every day. He looks way better than last time. I believe he's resting like this to recover. Ma'am? By the way, the other man's wife came a few days ago. For what? Her strange claims are giving us a headache. What did she say? Well... Why pretend you didn't know? You know who I am. Why pretend not to? Now, I know how you feel. You know how I feel? You're hiding something. So you hope things will pass quietly. Like it's all over. Am I wrong? I didn't come to fight. I'm tired enough as it is. Have you ever thought that maybe it's better to die? But you have to be alive to think that. We're trying to forget and move on. Why bring it up suddenly? What did you hear? I don't have anything against you, Hee-ju. A victim or culprit? It's useless to us. One died and the other is as good as dead. Why is it useless? He killed a man, but you say they're both victims? You can't say that! Hee-ju. If you think like that, I really pity you. If you're innocent, you wouldn't be here. You can say I'm a crazy bitch and just ignore me. Are you scared? You don't know anything. Does your brother know? It's got nothing to do with him! Didn't he tell you? What do you mean? You should've asked him before poking around. Ask him what he did. Where's the blood test? What do you mean? They must've done a toxicology test! I told you. His blood was clotted. Tell me the real reason why it was left out. Your lawyer told you? The other man's wife told me. What was the result? Tell me! Don't lie and tell the truth. I don't know. Tell me! It was slightly over the norm. That's not what caused the accident. It was a mistake. The blood test doesn't matter. Hee-ju. Was it for the money? What? Did you agree to hide it with them? For my insurance money to move to an apartment? Hee-ju! So-eun. - What are you doing? - Stop. How can you say that? PSYCHIATRIST I can't. Why not? I can't show it to anyone, but the patient. But I'm his wife. If you need it, please bring his consent form. What's this? His death certificate. I'm sorry, but I still can't. He's still my patient. I can't show his medical records to others. But I'm his wife. Wives are others, too. It's a natural response. Why? How is that natural? The doctor explained to you before. He's not doing things consciously. How long has it been? Please prescribe some medication. There's nothing wrong with your ears. If you rest and eat well... The ringing won't stop! I've seen some cases where it's just psychological. I can refer you to consult with a psychiatrist, if you'd like. I don't need it. The rice is good. Not soggy. Why'd you go there? Where? Why would you go to the accident scene? I just happened to pass by. Then why ask the police? Is there still something left? Why are you asking me? It was a car accident. You two deal with it. Don't bring a blameless company into it. Is it really blameless? They say don't even disturb dogs when they eat. But he was treated worse than a dog! This guy is that cafeteria woman's husband, right? Forget it. Don't get involved and chuck it. I'm just curious. Thank you. Do you work here? Yes. I have a question. Where is my dad? Where's Dad? Getting examined. Let's go eat. This happened. An old latch on some steel pipes broke and we got crushed. The boss was nice and seemed to care at first. We were dispatched workers. The firm that arranged us to work there closed and ran off. Then the company changed. They said to take it up with the firm, when we worked here. They said to chase it down and get compensated elsewhere. I've been protesting like this since then. You did it alone? I got lucky and lost an arm. But Nam-gil got struck all over. He couldn't even walk well. His back was injured badly. He had to lie in bed and watch the ceiling all day. When I visited him, his eyes were blank and lost. Still, I should've visited him to chat and stuff. Why did he take the car out that day? Aren't you eating? Mom. Hurry up. Your dad will be done soon. There's something I didn't tell you. What now? When Dad was lying home, I came back from school to find the house a mess with broken dishes and stuff all over the floor. I got scared and ran to Dad's room. But Dad was just sleeping. What are you talking about? His blanket was trembling. So I went up and lifted it slightly. Dad was holding a knife. He was trembling. We're done eating. Dad left with the car that day to kill himself. I should've told you. Then maybe he... I'm sorry, Mom. No. You must've seen wrong. You don't know why he left. Nobody knows. We have to tell Hee-ju. What? Because of me... The innocent lady is suffering. Eun-young. Look at me. Stop crying. How do you know that woman? Tell me! I went to her house. Why would you go there? Did you tell her? You told her? Did you? Eun-young! Tell me! 1000 DAYS ACCIDENT-FREE ACHIEVED! Hee-ju? What are you doing here? Did you drink? Why'd you hide it? Hide what? That Nam-gil was injured here and couldn't move much! Why didn't you tell me? You're drunk. I'll drive you home. Why would a man in his state drive? Why would he take the pain and drive out there? Who knows? You should know! I heard everything. He went to die. Who said that? Perturbed? A man died because of the company! Why kill an innocent man and not just himself? Let's talk when you're sober. I'll explain everything. Explain what? You're an accomplice! Everyone here is at fault! INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT! OWNER MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY! Some young woman left that. Hee-ju. I'm sorry. I gotta go. I'm really sorry. Stop it! He was with me that day. Your husband and I drank together. I should've stopped him. I shouldn't have let him drive. I'm so sorry, Hee-ju. I'll make it up to you for life. So let's just drop this. Don't reinvestigate the case. Please Hee-ju? What are you saying? You've got it all wrong. My husband didn't cause the accident. He's the victim! Whether you drank with him or whether he drove or not, he wasn't the one who crossed the centerline! If you say otherwise, don't come to me again. Are you okay? Who said you can come here? I'm sorry. I must tell you something. I'm done talking with you. Your parents are at fault. That day... There's something I didn't tell you. I knew who you were. You knew everything? I went to your husband's funeral with Mom. I saw you in the bathroom. What? I saw... you slapping yourself hard. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I'll take the punishment. How? Get out. Go! Leave! Get out of here! Go! Hi, it's Eun-young's mom. Is my daughter there? I see. Ma'am? Don't worry. Kids do this from the stress of studying. We'll find her. Please wait at the hospital. Ma'am? Hold on. I'm sorry to bring this up now, but they asked for a reinvestigation through their lawyer. Forensics will come to reinvestigate. What happens then? No big deal. It's just a hassle. What if something else comes up? I doubt it. What if the result changes? Calm down. We concluded everything after a thorough investigation. I just thought you should know. Don't worry. First, let's find Eun-young. Okay? I checked with highway management. The guardrail damage was not related to this case. There's evidence of damage before the accident. There's nothing suspicious with his insurance either. He didn't have much insurance at all. We can't say he caused the accident for insurance money. We'll wait for forensics, but... Are you listening? Will you still proceed? Here's what you asked. Please pay for this in cash. There's something I must tell you. Let's talk at work. Not now. I quit. I'll just say it and go. Before the accident, Nam-gil came to the factory. Please stop. You must hear it. He attacked the boss with a knife. The boss fought him off and called the police. Nam-gil asked to let him go. I walked him to his car and said to see a doctor. I said we won't report him, and he should get treated. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have let him go. I should've kept him there. So what? What does that have to do with the accident? He grabbed me and asked, if he died, will the company acknowledge him. He asked if we'll say he's our employee if he died. I had no idea he'd do that. It's all my fault. This is my severance pay. Please use it for his hospital fees. You're wrong. Don't bother me to feel less burdened. Get out! So-eun. Here's all your insurance money. We don't need it, so take it. Please don't do this. We never asked for that money. We only took it because you said you can't use it. Don't treat us like we're bums. We don't need an apartment. I can't take it. Take it. Please. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Ever thought of why your brother drank with him? We knew that you filed for divorce. Know what was in his smashed car trunk? What? Tell me. It was filled with pills. Anti-depressants. Way too many. Your brother worked hard to hide them. Don't ever call us again. We're not family anymore. MEDICAL RECORDS DEPRESSION. POOR RELATIONS WITH WIFE Is Eun-young here by chance? Will you come in? What did you say to Eun-young? She knew everything about what your husband did. That's her opinion. It's not a fact. Can your husband wake up? How convenient for him. He doesn't even know what he did. Don't jump to conclusions when you don't know anything. Stop pretending you don't know! What did you do while your husband thought of suicide? You did nothing! You know it! Stop pretending you don't! Stop pretending! You only thought of yourself! He'll wake up! Then he'll explain everything that happened! He's awake. Why go this way of all else? It's the only way. KIM Si-eun YEOM Hye-ran PARK Ji-hu Directed by BAE Jong-dae
