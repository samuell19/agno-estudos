(mellow music) - Most fairy tales begin with four magic words. Once upon a time. But the story you're about to hear happened more than once. It happened more than twice. In fact, somewhere, it's still happening. Over and over again. That's because this story is about time itself, and time has no ending. But it does have a beginning. And the beginning is as good a place as any to start a fairy tale.

Are those bullies picking on you again? - Well, it's these stupid glasses. - Your glasses? - Why else would they tease me? - Because you let them. You've got to stand up for yourself. - But I'm scared of them. I'm scared of everyone. - You're not scared, you're just shy. And you're no different than anyone else. We all have things that make us feel insecure. - Those bullies don't. Nothing bothers them. - I wouldn't be too sure about that if I were you. People aren't always what they seem. - They're not? - Nope, and neither are you. Remember, you can't judge a book by its cover.

He searched for buried treasures inside the Cave of Riches. Instead, he found an old lamp, a magic lamp, that would give him any wish his heart desired. But Aladdin felt no richer for his wealth until he used the lamp's magic to rescue the princess from the clutches of an evil sorcerer. - By saving the princess, Aladdin discovered the most valuable treasure of all: true love. Are you getting all this, Tambor? - Yes, Your Majesty. - Good. Now where was I? Ah, yes. And they lived happily ever after. (laughing) - The end. (sighing) (ominous music) - You call this living happily ever after? - I call it covering my tracks. - You'll never get away with this, Scheherazade. - Oh, but I already have, Princess. Not only have I stolen Aladdin's magic lamp, but I've used it to make your soft-hearted father fall hopelessly in love with me. Now his entire kingdom is mind to command. Isn't that right, Sultan? - Yes, dear. - But why go to all the trouble of writing that, that fairy tale? - Because people believe whatever they read, and I don't want the name Scheherazade to go down in history as a wicked old- - Witch? - I was going to say queen. - Oh, whoopsie. My mistake. - So now that I have everything my black heart desires, I'm going to hide the lamp in a place it will never be found. - Hmmm, but where? - Not where, Tambor, when. The future! (laughing) - I knew that. - Magic lamp, I wish you away! Vanish unto some distant day! (thunder rumbling) (screaming) Now then, what's our next order of business? - Oh, the peasants tried revolting again. - Oh, what was it this time? - Taxes, famine, slavery, the usual. - Ah well, we'll have to do something to calm them down. - You could always cut taxes. - What? I'd rather cut off one of their heads. - Oh, an excellent idea, Your Excellency! Did you have a particular head in mind? - As a matter of fact, I do. (chuckling) (gasping) - [Guard] It's time, Aladdin. (somber music) - This wasn't here yesterday. I wonder- Hmmm, no, that's silly. There's no such thing as a magic lamp. But I wish I knew where it came from. (mysterious music) It's Aladdin! And he's in trouble! If only I could give him his lamp. Wait a minute, I can! Magic lamp, I wish Aladdin were here! (crowd shouting) (screaming) Are you all right? - No, I'm not all right, I landed on my- Head. (laughing) Hey, isn't that great? I landed on my head! - You must've landed harder than I thought if you're happy about it. - Don't you get it? I still have my head! Woo, for a while there, it looked like- - I'm just glad you're okay. - Thanks. Um- - I'm Paige. - Paige? Huh. What a funny name. - What's so funny about it? - It makes you sound like a book. - Well, it's better than Aladdin. - It is not! Wait a minute, you know my name? - I know everything about you. - How? Where did you get this? - My grandpa gave it to me. This is his antique shop. - What's an antique? - Something from the past, like that book. - If this book is from the past, then this must be the future! - I guess it is, for you. - But how did I get here? - I made a wish. - On what? - On this! (ominous music) - Where are we going? - To consult the Enchanted Hourglass. - Sands of time, heed my call! Make yourself a crystal ball! - You saved my life. I don't know how to thank you. Yes I do! I'll give you a wish, any wish you want. What'll it be, huh? A handsome prince? A castle in the clouds? How about a unicorn? - I don't want any of those things. - There must be something you want. - There is, but- It's silly. - Aw, the sillier the better when it comes to wishes! Believe me, I should know. Spill it. - Well, I don't have any friends, except for my books. I know they're just paper and ink, but sometimes I wish- - What? - I wish they could talk. (coughing) - Oh, fire! Help, someone! Anyone! - Who said that? - I did. - But you're just a book. - My name is Wordsworth, and I am not just a book. I am a history book, and I burn quite easily. - But there's no fire. It's just a little smoke. - My dear boy, logic would dictate that where there is smoke, there is fire. - But this is magic smoke, from Aladdin's lamp. - [Wordsworth] Aladdin's lamp? Ooh, you've been reading too many fairy tales. - And what's wrong with fairy tales, you outdated old reprint? - [Wordsworth] Stay out of this, Jack. - Jack? Of Jack and the Beanstalk? (yawning) - Would you guys keep it down? I'm trying to sleep. - You're Sleeping Beauty! - I bet you don't know my name. - [Paige] Rumpelstiltskin. - Has anybody seen my glass slipper? - [Paige] And you're Cinderella! - Hey, you know me?

Time is on my side. - If you're done wishing, I should be on my way. - You're leaving? - I have a kingdom to save. - From what? - Scheherazade. - Schehera who? (wind howling) - Sands of time, change and form! Create for me a magic storm! - [Dorothy] It's a twister, Auntie Em! - Wrong story, farm girl. - Aladdin, do something! The lamp, I've got it! - Come to papa. (laughing) - Sorry, finders keepers! You stopped the storm, Aladdin, but you'll never stop me. - She's got the magic lamp! - Yes, and rest assured that it won't be so easy to find in the future, or should I say the past? (laughing) - Now I'll never get back to my own time. - Would that hourglass help? - It would, but Scheherazade has it. - You mean she has half of it. - The sands of time! - Now you can go home. - First I have to find the magic lamp. It's the only way to stop Scheherazade. - But you don't know where she hid it. The lamp could be anyplace in history. - I could tell you where it is. - You could? Where? - I said I could tell you, I didn't say I would tell you. - Oh, please, Mr. Wordsworth. - Why should I? You've left me sitting on this shelf for years. Unopened, unread, collecting dust. Do you know that I'm allergic to dust? (sneezing) - Ah, who needs him anyway? He's so old he probably doesn't even have all his pages. - I beg your pardon? My text is complete and unabridged. - Aladdin, you're making him mad. - Shhh, that's exactly what I wanna do. Come on, play along. - You're right, Aladdin. Wordsworth couldn't possibly know who has the magic lamp. - For your information, there happens to be a gravy boat which looks very much like the lamp on the dinner table of King Henry VIII. - Never heard of him. - Of course you have. He was the fattest king in history. - [Paige] The 35th birthday of King Henry VIII. - Thanks, Wordsworth, you've been a big help. - I have? Oh, wait a minute! You've tricked me! - Yep, sure did. Let's go, Paige, we don't want to be late for dinner. - Dinner? With a king? Oh, I'd be too scared. You go, and maybe some day I'll read about it. - But reading about it isn't half as much fun as living it. - Oh, I don't know. - Come on, it'll be the adventure of all time. - What do I do? - Just hold my hand. Sands of time, you must obey. Send us back to the king's birthday. - Goodbye! - Have a safe journey! - Goodbye, and good riddance. - Didn't think we'd leave without you, did you, Wordsworth? - I am not going anywhere! - [Aladdin] Think again. (shouting) - I could have you arrested for shoplifting. - Sorry, Wordsworth, but once I picked you up, I just couldn't put you down. - Oh my, oh dear! My cake, my beautiful cake! - Mmmm, chocolate. Not bad. - Not bad? This is horrible! You've ruined King Henry's birthday cake! How am I going to explain this to the court? Oh my dear, oh, they're here! - Who? - [Baker] The royal family, that's who! (shouting) Your Fatness, Your Hugeness, Your Wideness, Your Obeseness, ooh, Your Bigness, Your Tubbiness. - Cut the sweet talk, baker. Where's my husband's cake? (groaning) - I'm afraid it got smooshed. - Maybe we should smoosh you. - Stop that! What gives you the right to come in here and throw your weight around? - Who dares raise their voice to royalty? - I do. - Oh, I beg your pardon, Princess. - Princess? - You must be a princess. I've never seen such fancy robes. - What kingdom are ya from? - Allow me to present Princess Paige of, um. - Libraria, nitwit. - Of course. Princess Paige of Libraria, Nitwit. - And who might you be? Certainly not a prince dressed in rags like those. - He's my royal gastronomist. - Royal what? - He's my cook. - Oh, then this little fellow must be your cookbook. - Cookbook? Why, I never! - You better if you don't want to end up as scrap paper. - Madame, my culinary talents are at your service. - Well, it just so happens that we are in need of a cook to prepare my brother's dinner. - [Aladdin] It would be our pleasure. Right, Wordsworth? - My pages are rippling with excitement. - Then it's settled. You're hired. Baker, we'll be expecting another cake by dessert. - Oh yes, Your Fatness. Good luck, you'll need it. (groaning) - I'm afraid my cousin is very difficult to please. We go through as many as three cooks a day. - Let me guess, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. - Yes, and you should see how fat the lions are getting. - You mean if the king doesn't like the meal, you feed it to the lions? - No no no, of course not. We feed the cook to the lions. - Oh, the cook. The cook? - Anything else would be a waste of food. - Come along, now. It's almost time for din-din. - Yeehaw! (all shouting) (stately music) - I hope you know how to cook. (growling) - How hard can it be? - Recipe for turkey stuffing. After beating a dozen eggs with bread and water, add a pinch of pepper, a dash of salt, and a splash of sherry. - Was that a pinch, a dash, and a splash, or a splash, a dash, and a pinch? - Here, read it yourself. - Uh, I can't. I don't know how. - I wish you hadn't told me that. - [Aladdin] Why? - It's very hard to dislike someone you feel sorry for. - [Aladdin] Wordsworth? - Yes? - [Aladdin] Stuff it. - I beg your pardon? - The turkey. Stuff the turkey. I'm gonna look for the magic lamp. - So, what's a nice book like you doing in a place like this, hm? (snoring) - Any sign of the lamp? - This table is so long, I'm not sure what's on it. How's Wordsworth coming with the main course? - Let's hope it's fit for a king. (trumpet fanfare) - Presenting the royal family! (rumbling) - [Queen] Look at all that food! - Isn't the king going to eat with us? - Oh, I'll try my best. - You're King Henry VIII? - In the flesh, or should I say the bones. - But you're so skinny. - Yes, well, trying to live up to my family name has left me without much of an appetite. - Bring out the bird! - Your family name? - The last seven Henrys were all larger than life. They stood firm like mountains, and commanded respect. Me, I can't even go outside without blowing away. Children tie a string 'round me neck and use me as a kite. Do you know how embarrassing it is to get stuck in a tree? - [Wordsworth] Turkey a la king. - But your weight doesn't have anything to do with what kind of a king you are. It's like my grandpa always says, you can't judge a book by its cover. - Truer words were never spoken. - Is anybody going to eat that drumstick? - Sorry, Countess, that's for His Majesty. - What's that? Oh, no, I couldn't possibly, thank you. - Come on, it won't kill you to take one bite. - But it will kill you if he doesn't. - Oh! - Well, at least the lions won't starve tonight. - The lions? - You're catnip, cookie. Pass the gravy, Henry dear. - Wait a minute. None of this makes sense. King Henry is famous for being fat. Are you sure you're not hungry? - Oh, I wish I were.

Woo! (grumbling) - Raise the drawbridge! (shouting) - Oh no, not again! - [Aladdin] Paige, help! - Aladdin? (growling) - Nice kitty, very pretty, pretty kitty. - Wordsworth, find the lamp! - [Aladdin] Wordsworth! - Found it. - Magic lamp, I wish- (growling) - Just what exactly did you wish for? - Dandelions, what else? - (laughing) Help me out of here. - Can I hold the lamp for you, princess? - Thank you, baker. - No, thank you, my lovely. - [Aladdin] Scheherazade! - Sands of time, with power sublime, take me far from the scene of this crime! - Lower the drawbridge! - [Aladdin] Let's get out of here! - [Wordsworth] Historically speaking, heroes do not run away. - [Aladdin] In fairy tales, Wordsworth, we call it escaping! - [Wordsworth] Good word. - [Aladdin] Come on! Ya, ya! - Where exactly are we escaping to? - Wherever Scheherazade hid the magic lamp. - In that case, count me out, because I'm not going there. - Wordsworth, do you know where the lamp is? - I could take an educated guess. - Don't leave us in suspense. - You don't understand, I get seasick. - Seasick? Who has the lamp this time, a pirate? - Blackbeard, to be exact. - [Paige] The lamp's in his treasure chest! - Magic sand, it's time to flee. Take us to the deep blue sea! (grumbling) - Gather round, me hearties! Let us see what treasure this sunken chest contains. - There's nothing here but sand, captain. - And a couple of stowaways. - Stowaways? Did you say stowaways? Ooh, how exciting! No one's ever stowed away on me ship before. Welcome aboard. - Who are you? - Oh, I'm only the most fearsome, loathsome pirate who ever sailed the seven seas. - You're Blackbeard? - Take a gander at me beard, missy. Does it look black? - No. - And what color is it? - Blond. - Now do you know who I am? - Don't tell me your name's Blondbeard. - Aye, that it be. - His grammar is atrocious. - But his hair's beautiful. There aren't even any split ends. - Well, thanks for noticing. I do use a seaweed and saltwater conditioner. - Excuse me, but we're stowaways, and you're a pirate. Shouldn't you make us walk the plank or something? - Oh, right, I always forget that. Thanks for reminding me. Would you mind? - [Paige and Aladdin] Would we mind what? - Walking the plank. It would really impress the boys. - No no no, you're not supposed to ask us. You're supposed to order us. - Oh, right, but nobody follows me orders. Watch, I'll tell you. Ahem, avast ye, mateys! All hands on deck! Lift that barge, tote that bale! - Aw, not now, captain, we're playing cards. Do you have any sevens? - Go fish. (hiccuping) - You see what I mean? Nobody's scared of a pretty pirate. Real pirates have eyepatches and peg legs, but all I have is a gorgeous blond beard and a treasure chest full of sand. Shiver me timbers, what's this - Hey, could I see that? - Oh, you can have it as far as I'm concerned. It's worthless. Oh, I wouldn't say that. (gasping) (shouting) - It's that showoff Long John Silver. Now he's a pirate. He's got a parrot and everything. - Ahoy there, ye cowardly swabs! - Cowardly swabs, cowardly swabs, rawk! - Surrender your treasure, or I'll sink that floating junkyard ye call a ship! - Surrender or else, surrender or else, rawk! (ominous music) - Now what did I do with that white flag? Oh, here it is. - You don't have to surrender. Not as long as I have this. - Oh, thanks for reminding me. I'll be needing that back. - You can't give the lamp to Long John Silver! - [Blondbeard] It's the only treasure I got. - Why don't you fight back? - Because he's Long John Silver, and I'm just, oh, I'm me. - But he just picks on you because you let him. Believe me, I should know. There are these bullies back home who do the same thing to me. You've got to stand up for yourself. - But he scares me! - So scare him back. - I don't know how. - You have to try. I know you don't believe me, but you really are Blackbeard, the most fearsome, loathsome pirate of the seven seas. - Oh, I wish I were, lass. I wish I were.

So far you've been wrong about King Henry and Blackbeard. - But I'm right about Scheherazade. She was the kindest, noblest, most generous queen in history. - Haha, now who's telling fairy tales, huh? - Cross-reference me if you doubt it. - He's right! He's right, Aladdin. You should read what it says about her. - I don't want to. - The truth is, he can't. - Hey, put a bookmark in it, Wordsworth! - Is that true, Aladdin? - The reason you have so much to read is because I never learned how. I was too busy having adventures to go to school. - But going to school is an adventure. - It is? I wish I could go to school with you. But wishing doesn't do me much good without the magic lamp. - Speaking of which, you might want to skim page 310. (laughing) Not so fast, not so fast! That tickles! - Sorry. - So, huh? Who has it this time? - Cleopatra. - Wow. Whoa. She's beautiful. - Sure, if you like goddesses. - Magic sand, to Egypt for a while! Take us to the Queen of the Nile. As I see it, we have two ways down. - I'm afraid of heights. Pick one, quick. - There are the stairs, but that'll take forever. - Is the other way faster? - Much. (shouting) - Remember when I said I was afraid of heights? Well, I'm afraid of falling even more. - Prince Raji, you have been charged with breaking your promise of marriage to my beloved Cleopatra. How do you plead? - Innocent, by reason of insanity. - Insanity? - Anybody who gets engaged to your daughter has to be crazy. - I sentence you to a lifetime inside the Sphinx. - Oh, no, please, no! Anything but that, oh no no, I beg of you, please! Be fair, no, no! (shouting) - I believe I was more than fair with Prince Raji. If I wasn't, may the gods drop the sky on my head. (shouting) - Something broke our fall. - Yes, the Pharaoh's head. - Now Cleopatra is queen! - What should we do with these vagabonds? - Let's drown them in the Nile. - Well, we always do that. How about we bury them in the desert? - No, too much digging. I know, I know! We could boil them in oil. - Why don't you guys just let the queen decide, huh? - My father was a king among men, the Emperor of Egypt, and you squashed him like a beetle. What have you got to say for yourselves. - Whoops. - I couldn't have said it better myself. - Uh, what Aladdin means is, it was an accident. - Well, accident or not, you must be punished. Sacrifice the girl and the book to the Sphinx. - The girl and the book? What about the boy? This whole thing was his fault anyway. - The cute one has a choice. He could spend the rest of his life in prison. - Or? - Or be my husband. - When's the wedding? - Aladdin! - Hey, either way, it's the old ball and chain, huh? - Take them to the Sphinx! - Oh, great Sphinx, awake! - Who summons the lion god? - In the name of Cleopatra, we offer you these souls. - Your sacrifice is accepted. (gasping) - Where are we? - You are nowhere, trapped in the blackness of eternity. - And who, may I ask, are you? - Once I was a prince, but now I am one of the lost souls. Soon you will be like the rest of us. - We'll never be like you! Aladdin will rescue us! - Provided he's not on his honeymoon with Cleopatra. - What does he see in her? - You're kidding, right? (humming) - I'll be out in two shakes of a camel's tail. - I can't wait to meet you. You are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. - [Cleopatra] Oh, really? - There's just one thing I don't understand. Why would you have to force someone to marry you? (gasping) - Do you really think I'm beautiful? - You're- Uh, you're Cleopatra? - Yes, but you can call me Cleo. - When I get my hands on Wordsworth, I'm gonna dogear his pages. - And what should I call you? - Uh, how about calling me a cab? (whistling) - There's got to be a way out of here. - No one but Oedipus the King has ever escaped the Sphinx. - How did he manage that? - He solved the riddle. - What riddle? - What creature walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening? - Wordsworth? - I beg your pardon, I am not a joke book. - What is your answer, pitiful creature? - I'm not pitiful, and human beings aren't creatures! Or are we? Wordsworth, that's it! That's the answer! - What is? - Human beings. (shouting) I did it, Wordsworth! I answered the riddle! - But the answer is illogical. How does a human being walk on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening, hmmm? When we're babies, we crawl on our hands and knees. When we grow up, we walk on two feet. And when we grow old, we limp with a cane. - Hmmm. Well, personally, I prefer a good knock knock joke to riddles. - Okay, I've got one for you. Knock knock. Who's in there? - [Male Voice] The pharaoh. - Oh, the pharaoh who? - It's Cleopatra's father! - But now he's probably a mummy. - Not funny, Wordsworth. Let's get out of here. We've got to find the magic lamp. - Actually, Egyptian monarchs were often buried with all their worldly possessions. - [Paige] You mean- - The lamp could be inside. - We'll get married tomorrow, right after they bury Daddy. - Tomorrow? Uh, isn't that a little soon? I mean, we hardly even know each other, right? - Would you like a date? - Uh, no thanks, I'm not hungry. - I mean with me. (playful music) - Sorry, pharaoh. We need this more than you do. - No problem. - Magic lamp, I wish we were with Aladdin. (giggling) - I'm sorry, Cleo, but I can't marry you, I just can't. Or even date you, I just can't do it. - Are you playing hard to get, precious cargo? - No, the truth is, I have a princess. - But why have a princess when you can have a queen? (shouting) (energetic music) - Aladdin! - Paige! - I've got the lamp. - Oh, I could kiss you! - What about me? - Who are you? - Would you believe Cleopatra? - Cleofatra is more like it. - [Paige] Wordsworth! - He's right, I'm fat and ugly. No wonder nobody wants to marry me. (sobbing) - Come on, now's our chance! - We can't leave her like this. - What else can we do? - We could let her make a wish. - I advise against this. - I gotta tell you, for once, I agree with Wordsworth. Let's go by the book. - Oh, finally, the credit I deserve. - But what about history? If we leave now, the books will be wrong. - [Wordsworth] I hadn't thought of that. - [Paige] Besides, I know how she feels. - You do? - Back home, the boys call me Four Eyes. - Oh, they call me Thunder Thighs. - It's not important what other people think. What's important is what you think. - I think they're right. - They're not right! Don't ask me how I know, but inside, you're the most beautiful and desirable girl in the world. - I wish I were.

Starting with the two of yours. - What? - Before I forget, this is for you. With my deepest thanks. - You're giving it back? - My wishes have all come true. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go inspire poets and cause war between nations. - Aladdin and the girl have recovered the magic lamp. - You have such a grasp of the obvious, it's scary. - Aren't you going after them? - Why should I? - Because if you don't, they'll come after us. I mean you. - And when they do, I'll have a surprise waiting for them. - What kind of surprise? - A big one. - [Paige] I guess it's time to go home. - [Aladdin] For both of us. - There still are so many places I'd like to visit and people I'd like to meet. - So why don't we? - Why don't we what? - Why don't we go everywhere, meet everyone? - Can we? - Sure, it's up to you! - I wish I had more time.

Aladdin, do something! - I wish, oh, oh no! I wish I wasn't such a klutz. (screaming) - [Scheherazade] The lamp fell into the center of the earth! - Here it comes! - The lamp! - Got it. - Easy come, easy go. - Easy for you.

(screaming) - [Tambor] I'll take that, if you don't mind. - Let go of it, you snake! - Ooh, sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me. - Want to bet? - There's still a little sand left. - No, a few grains won't take us back very far. - They'll take us back far enough. I wish we were with Aladdin. Magic sand, it's time to go. Five minutes back and 50 leagues below. Long time no see. - What the- - I thought you might need this. (growling) - Hey, any ideas on how to kill a dinosaur, Wordsworth? - Um, an ice age would do the trick. - I wish for a glacier! - What are you looking for, snookums? - On your knees, fool! Help me find the sands of time! - You're history, Scheherazade! - Oooh, please, Aladdin, spare me! - You didn't spare the kingdom.

I'll never forget you. - If truth be told, I won't forget you either. - Really? - [Wordsworth] How can I? You made history. - Now that I've restored the enchanted hourglass, you can go home whenever you're ready. - I'm afraid. - Of facing those bullies? - I was always too shy to stand up for myself. I guess I believed them when they called me a bookworm. But look at me now! I've stood up to the most famous people in history. - And what have you learned? - It doesn't matter whether you're a king, a queen, or a pirate. Everybody is insecure about something. Even a bully.

It's not my fault that I have freckles. - [Bully] It's not my fault that I have braces. - It's nobody's fault! So if you guys don't want to be teased, you shouldn't tease anyone else, including people with glasses. Is that a deal? - Yeah, it's a deal. - Yeah. - How long have you worn glasses? - I just got them. - Aladdin? - Yeah, it's my favorite. - Mine too. - My name's Alan. - I'm Paige. - Paige? Wow, what a cool name. It makes you sound like a book. - Do you like to read? - I love to. - Most fairy tales end with six magic words. - Stop! I hate it when stories end like this. - [Gramps] And they lived- - Don't do this to me! - Happily- - There's the word. - Ever- - I'm not listening! - After. - Oh, you just had to say it, didn't you. - Sorry, it's the only way I know to end a fairy tale.
