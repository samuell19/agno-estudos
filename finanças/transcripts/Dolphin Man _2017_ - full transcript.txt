We sea men are not normal. They call us "sub" because we really are subnormal. Because what Jacques Mayol did wasn't normal. If that was normal, we would have been really crazy. I woke up one morning and asked, "where is Jacques?" calling Jacques. He's in the pool and I thought he was by the pool doing yoga or something. No, he was underwater. What the hell was he doing underwater? That guy is crazy, he was underwater in the pool. For 4 minutes, 2 minutes. Yes, he reached 3-4 minutes, even more. Very calm. How the heck he did it, I never understood. When you go underwater, the feelings you have in the normal world disappear. Your body changes weight, changes size. Your heartbeat slows down. 12,13 beats per minute. The force of gravity affects you in a different way. At a depth of 150 metres, you have 16 kilograms of pressure on every square centimetre of your body. Your lungs shrink to 1/16th of their normal volume. The problem with apnea is fainting, when you have very little oxygen going to the heart and the brain. You lose consciousness, and if there's nobody to help you to the surface, you die. Traditionally yoga means getting connected with the self and then going into a kind of transcendence. Mayol came to this institution because there are many yoga techniques where we work with breathing and these breathing techniques could be useful in his own profession of diving. I just tried to explain to him how these different techniques work. Like kapalbhati fast breathing, and uddiyana, a kind of cessation of breath. I will not say breath holding because at the mental level you are still having the awareness of inhalation or exhalation. Air is not moving, but the mind is still working, inhaling, or exhaling. He'd done many things in life, he moved around a lot, leaving his family. He'd been a driver for Hollywood actresses when he was young, such as Zsa Zsa Gabor, she was very famous at the time. He had several jobs. All he wanted was a FIAT 500, or a Volkswagen with a small bed and the right company. And the possibility of changing girls every now and then. This was his life, his dream. It didn't matter where he was. Japan or Africa, any place was fine. He was a real nomad, a nomad who travelled in an extraordinary way. With nothing. It was quite strange. I remember travelling with him through the airport in Miami, his passport in one hand and a strap with fins, a snorkel and mask in the other. And that was it. Nothing else. It was very strange. That's why from time to time he squatted, and he invited himself into people's homes here and there. It wasn't really a friendship. He took advantage of people often. He was very careful with money. We were his friends and we accepted him for who he was. I remember when he'd come to Turin, he'd stay at my house for a month or more. It didn't bother me because I considered him a friend, he was my idol and very special to me, but he didn't contribute to expenses. We became friends but when you work with Jacques, Jacques doesn't exist. Jacques is another person. Jacques goes to I don't know where. He was like an actor. He created a character to earn more money. What surprised me most, was when he called me for a job, without specifying what it was about. For a movie in the Bermuda Triangle. Obviously I was very excited to go to the Bermuda Triangle to film with Jacques Mayol. Then he told me it would be a sexy movie, erotic. I was really surprised when I read the script by the imagination of this man. He directed it under another name. He didn't use his real name. For me he was a genius of the underwater field. Screenwriter. Director. He did everything. He was a very positive person, he thought positively, laughing and joking like positive people do, cheerful. But he never talked about his private life. It was like a wall for him, darkness. You couldn't enter. Gerda. She was just like him. She was his ideal partner and had the same temperament. She was free, she loved animals and they were both happy. They built a house together, they kept the same old car, they shared the same taste in food. Anything he liked, she liked. And Jacques lost it all. One day she was stabbed by a stranger in a supermarket. When it happened, he went into a profound depression. Because Jacques Mayol had always been a lonely man. How did our friendship become something special? Jacques would say that we can't communicate easily with words, but like dolphins, it was telepathy. I was working part-time in a marina in Katsuyama, and the owner of the marina said to me "Narita, there's a strange foreigner looking for you, asking if Narita is here, in Japanese." "Who would that be?" When I went outside, I see Jacques Mayol! As we talked, Jacques started to cry. When I remember it, it brings tears to my eyes too. He said, "Gerda has died." There was a piano there, he started playing and said, "Music is my friend, music is my sweetheart. But music can't fill in the emptiness of Gerda's death." That's what he said. My diving teacher, Eishin Osaki, introduced him to a Buddhist priest at the temple of Daikoin, in the area of Ito, in lzu. There he learned from the Buddhist priest, about the spiritual elements of Zen and Japan. If you ask me what Zen means, I would say simplicity, a peaceful mind. That's what Zen is. What Jacques may have gained from Zen in order to dive deeper was to free his mind from his thoughts, and let them all flow. He even let go of the fear of getting sucked into the darkness. I believe he achieved the state of Zen. My grandfather would say, if you are thinking too much, your brain needs more oxygen. If you let your thoughts go, you can stay in the water longer. I think it's just the practice of freeing your thoughts. I think Jacques believed that before humans created societies, they were more pure creatures closer to dolphins. Jacques returned to that. He met dolphins, he lived the way dolphins do, he followed their ways. I think he wanted to live like they do. That's why Jacques would go into the sea, swim with dolphins, learn the ways of dolphins. But basically Jacques had a cynical attitude towards humans and human society. We were talking about the environment once, and Jacques told me, that it would be better for nature if humans didn't exist. What did you say? Speak a little. Give me a kiss. Bravo and another. Shall we swim? There, there. We play, we swim. I'll be your mom. I'm teaching you to swim. I'm teaching you to swim. With your little webbed feet, but you only paddle with your front legs, eh? You don't paddle your back legs to swim, let me see. There you go, show me. What are you saying? Yes, you're so pretty. Stories of fish and stories of otters. We should go swimming together. Yes, what? Come come, back into the water. Show me those paws. The story begins like this. We were making a film based on my contact with whales. We took a trip to where there are humpback whales and we made a final stop in the Caicos Islands. When the boat was docked, who did I see on the dock? Jacques Mayol. When he returned the next day, I asked him, "Do you want to see the whales?" "Yes, I've never seen whales, dolphins yes, but not whales." Humpback whales are singing whales. All their noises cause vibrations in the water. He felt it more because he was free-diving. He was in complete harmony with the environment. There was quite a touching moment. We were fortunate enough to see two whales courting, a sort of love parade, if you will. They were turning around each other and emitting sounds. They were actually speaking. And Jacques dove to their depth. He was in the middle of two beasts, or giants. This little guy was lost in the middle, very calm. The advertising director from Cressi came to my diving school accompanied by a nice moustached gentleman. They asked me if I was willing to participate in their training aimed at setting new records. They referred to the training as experiments. Jacques and I got along right away and we started working together. Practicing yoga certainly helped Jacques. He said, and the doctors agreed with him, that when he was underwater, 50% of the result was due to his fitness and training, while the other 50% was due to yoga. According to him there is no zero-point for the human body. He believed man could reach any depth he set his mind to. He wanted to reach maximum depth, to prove his theories. He always said that even if he had to die, he would fulfill his dream. We kept records of everything we did, we filmed and took pictures. We'd distribute them to the media, the newspapers and magazines. The media would write about him, about his dives, his experiments. He became more and more popular. We spent the whole season diving, and when it was time to set the record, we were fully prepared. But when you go down to those depths, there can always be something you didn't take into account, an accident can be just around the corner. French researcher Jacques Mayol has just broken the world record by diving to 100 metres in Elba. Jacques Mayol, 49 years of age. The Chinese and Japanese call him the French dolphin. He has broken the world free-diving record, diving without a breathing apparatus. Jacques Mayol, you improved upon your own world record. Well, it happened ten days ago. I predicted that man could reach the 100m mark. And indeed we reached 100 metres. So 100m is the limit? I don't think so. How many more metres? That is the real question. The 41st Cannes Film Festival opened with The Big Blue. The Big Blue is Luc Besson's highly anticipated third film based on the life of free-diver Jacques Mayol, a man who dove to 100m on a single breath. Nobody has seen the film until now. Luc Besson's The Big Blue is making a grand entrance into the history books of French cinema. In only 20 weeks it has attracted 3.5 million spectators, and has evolved from a simple film into a cultural phenomenon. I think this is my fifth time seeing it. This is my fifth time. Why? It's a very good film. A true success. 18th week, 400,000 tickets sold, a film that has played all summer to constantly sold-out crowds. Truly a triumph. I saw the movie, The Big Blue, and I felt that the way it portrayed the sea was very different. At that time, I was thinking of the sea more literally, as just a body of water. I hadn't thought of it as a place where you could search inside yourself. That world was mystical, and Japanese people are interested in mystical things. Our generation and the next generation, especially people who like the sea or are diving, they know the movie because it's famous, and they all know Jacques. I think my biggest role model is Jacques Mayol. I wanted to experience the same thing. To be so relaxed in the water, to feel like you don't need to breathe, to feel free. After that I went nuts, and this image stayed with me. I had this urge to go deep, something was calling me. When I was younger, I was a very hyperactive girl, I was always doing something, never thinking. And apnea brought me a certain calmness. I learned to stop at some point, and to focus on myself. I remember seeing him, there must have been 2.000 people waiting for an autograph, wanting to meet him. I was very excited. He invited me to Elba to dive with him. I remember the first dive with him, the water was calm. In the beginning I would watch him, and then I'd show off, going a bit deeper. No big deal, I was 25 years old, he was 70. At the end of the day diving with Mayol I asked him, "So Jacques, what do you think about me as an apneist?" He looked at me and said, "You know nothing about apnea." "You don't have the slightest idea of what apnea can offer you in terms of joy, of emotions." "Because for you, diving means to push harder and outdo the previous dive." The next day, I thought I'd be diving with him again, instead we went to the little bay next to his house, maybe 10-12 metres deep. I had already gone to 70-75m, so I wanted to dive deeper. He left me there and went away. Three and a half weeks later, I was still in that bay, absolutely unmotivated. It was on a day where I wasn't trying to prove anything, I wasn't pushing, I was just going up and down and for the first time, I felt as if the fins had slowly become an extension of my feet, of my legs. This allowed me, for the first time, to see myself from the outside. Mayol greatly influenced young people and the free-divers that he trained. But there came a time when things changed abruptly with the release of The Big Blue. Jacques Mayol was never entirely happy with the film, especially after its huge success. In fact, Jacques Mayol was frustrated that he didn't play himself in the film. From time to time he was bitter, he would lash out at people for no apparent reason. He seemed different to the person he used to be. I remember we tried to correct this problem with Canal+. He was asked to appear live to a large audience, but it didn't go very well. During this live shoot, Jacques Mayol was under a lot of pressure because we had four underwater cameras, there were cranes at the surface filming his departure, there were cameras everywhere. It was really a huge deal. He had an accident with his ear. He burst his eardrum while descending, maybe a little too quickly. So when he came to the surface he was furious and it completely rattled him. Even if it wasn't obvious to the general public, he felt it was a failure. Something happened to my ear. Bloody hell! Gradually he was losing his strength. He said it was depression. I didn't understand the meaning of the word "depression". He would often say, "Junji, the most important thing is family". "You have a house, and a dog." "The house, family and dog are the most important things." "Take good care of them." During the later years, I think Jacques was lonely. The fans didn't approach him saying "Jacques, Jacques!" like they did before, and he would usually be alone. He suggested we swim together or travel together. But I was busy with work. That's why, when I sit here, I remember such things and it's quite difficult for me to talk. Jacques Mayol has decided to return to The Big Blue for good. The famous diver committed suicide at his home in Italy, on the island of Elba at the age of 74. His life and records in free-diving inspired the famous film by Luc Besson. The logic behind a person committing suicide is that he has nothing to give anymore. He was number one and then he wasn't anymore. He never wrote why. He wrote nothing. He saluted. "I'm going to another world", it was a salute. Maybe to a world he believed would be better than this. The way we regard life and death, we often talked about it. In Japan, taking your own life is not a disgrace. Jacques' death had Samurai spiritual elements. I think it did. Yes. People should look at life and realize that everything has a life, everything has a purpose, and we should live with that awareness. Humans have two purposes. The first role of humans is to learn how to love. The second is to maintain balance with nature, with animals and plants. That really resonates with me, and I thought I should share it with others too. Jacques' death made me aware of the sadness within all humans, and I decided to cherish the things Jacques taught me. I still live like that today.
