Do you realize? Do you realize how much trouble you've caused with all this? How many people you have deceived? The faith of the people who climbed up there to watch your little show? Do you think it's right to keep this up? Do you think it's right to keep this up? But, you know, these things happen with children. A little game goes further than intended. At some point someone has to put an end to it. Now, Conchita. Let's be honest. Did you see the Virgin in San Sebastián de Garabandal? No. Never? Never. I have never seen the Virgin. It was all made up. We made it up. Good. Sign this. And the whole thing will be just like a dream. Isn't he handsome, the brigadier! I heard he's going to be promoted... Maybe they'll send him somewhere important... like Madrid? Where are you going? Somewhere else. Hey, Conchita, you're stealing apples! Be quiet! The teacher's wife will hear you! Don't run, Mari Cruz! We saw you and we're going to tell the owner! Concesa, go check the orchard! The sheep are eating the apples again! Oh, no! These apples aren't ours. Our guardian angel must be sad and the devil happy. Let's throw rocks at him! Conchita! What's wrong? Conchita? What is it? Something's happening to Conchita. Bye, Vicente. Hey, girls! Where have you been? We were...picking... apples. How come you're so excited? Umm... Well... We saw an angel! An angel? Don't worry. I'll talk with them tomorrow... And then with the other kids. Brigadier, I'm sure you'll do the right thing, but please let me speak to them too. I'm their teacher and I know them very well. It might just be the village boys playing a prank. I think they just have a vivid imagination. But, sure, go ahead. We can talk again later. Now what are we going to do? Ask Jesus for forgiveness. What's going on, girls? Is it true you've seen an angel? Yes, ma'am. Are you sure you didn't just imagine it? No, ma'am, no! We saw an angel! Okay, well... We're going to go to the chapel. To spend some time praying to Jesus in the Eucharist. Come with me. Conchita, didn't I tell you to get home before dark? Mom... The things I've heard today! And now you're late! Mom...well... we saw an angel! First you're late and then you lie to me. But it's true. I saw an angel. Look, Conchita. Even if the whole village saw an angel or the Virgin Mary, your chores come first. And I told you to be home before dark! But Mom, really... Really? Tell me, Conchita. Why did you come home late? Well, I was on the Path with Jacinta, Mari Cruz, and Mari Loli, and... and we saw an angel, Mom! It was like a boy, but... Conchita, stop telling stories. Would you behave like this if your father were alive? Mom, it's true... Sure it's true... I told you to get home before dark, and that's that. And you know what? You're going to bed without dinner. What have these girls been up to? Why did I have to come in such a hurry? There's talk of seeing an angel. Probably just a big hawk that scared them. The poor things! They were white as a ghost. Shaking! Nothing to get worried about. I'll speak with them. Just children playing games, no doubt. Not to worry, Fr. Valentín. Here comes the brigadier. - He'll take care of this. - Morning, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning, Brigadier. Good thing you're here. Just in time. - These girls are causing problems! - It's not that big a deal... Exactly! No big deal, no big deal. It's not worth talking about. See? Just kids being kids, no big deal. Hey! Look at that! Here come the girls. Fr. Valentín, let's go. Later, folks. Jacinta! Mari Cruz! So, what's this about you seeing... some angels? No. What a relief! We didn't see some angels... We just saw one. He was like a really strong boy! Listen, you are making a big mistake. Come right now to the church to tell the people that...that... There's no need to be scared just because we've seen an angel! Girls, girls, listen up. Conchita González was there with you, right? Okay, let's go pay her a visit. - Good idea. - And see what she has to say. - Fr. Valentín. - Let's go. Girls. Conchita! Let's see. I have a village full of kids who all want to see an angel. And to make it worse, their parents say that their kids don't want to do their chores, and that I'm filling their heads with crazy ideas. Haven't I taught you not to deceive people? Haven't I told you a thousand times not to lie? Now, tell me, what happened last night? I didn't lie, Fr. Valentín. I can't explain it... We saw an angel, like a boy but... really strong! Really... really strong. But, but... If you keep this up we're gonna call the Civil Guard, to interrogate you and send you to jail for being liars. Isn't that right, Brigadier? Well, I think the judge has more important things to do than deciding who won the last game of hide-and-seek. It's all just a game, right? Yes, it's true, We were playing, but... but we saw the angel. We're not lying. Believe us! Okay. We'll let a few days go by and see what happens. And if the angel appears, you ask him on my behalf who he is and what he wants. This guy's crazier than they are. Alright already, little girl. Have you any idea the trouble you're causing? You're making life impossible for your poor mother. This isn't a game. Enough already. Get them out of here. Fr. Valentín, this could get very ugly. By the way, have you talked with the bishop yet? Not yet, no. What's worse, we don't even have a bishop. Only an Apostolic Administrator. Bishop Alfaro is his name. But yes, he wants to speak with us. Fr. Valentín, I have no idea about this Church stuff. All I know is that this has already gone too far. And how did you get involved in this whole thing, Seco? Did they promote you to brigadier to babysit kids in a village? Your Excellency, I'm glad you have such a high opinion of me, but I got caught up in this by accident. That being said, the fact that... crowds of people are climbing up to a village which, as you well know, is under my jurisdiction gives me enough reason to get involved. So... Let's get to the point. Fr. Valentín, why am I receiving so many calls about this matter? Is it really that difficult to keep peace in a village parish? Don't you see I have more important things to do than waste time over four hysterical girls? I have spoken with the girls about what happened... About what happened? But nothing has happened. Six days ago you informed me about their little game, and I've heard quite enough. Look, you are in San Sebastián to guide the people in their simple devotions, not to create a revolution in the diocese. I... I wish that you, by yourself, would... come analyze the events, in person. It's not that simple. They say that... Yes, I know. People believe the Virgin is going to appear tomorrow. I think someone should chastise the girls, and make an announcement in the village apologizing for the confusion that has been caused. But... what if it's true? I have already taken care of all this. You just stay out of the way. Vergara has volunteered to direct a study of the matter. Fr. Juan Antonio will assist him. They will keep me informed of what's going on. Your Excellency, perhaps it's not that big a deal. Yeah, yeah...enough. You, just do your job. We will take care of the matter. I should probably move you somewhere else... Just try not to get in the way. It's all under control. - Brigadier. - Yes, Father. One moment. I know it seems a small matter to you, but you must put a stop to it. Thank you, Father, for your advice, but don't worry. It's all under control. Under control? It's getting totally out of hand. Yesterday, hundreds of people went up there to see the angel. What are you going to do when thousands turn up? Tomorrow they're expecting the Virgin. Why would the Virgin appear to four girls in a mountain village that cars can hardly get to? Use your head. This is going to cause problems for you and for me. Thank you, Father, for the advice. How sad! They're crazy. Mari Loli! Conchita! Jacinta! Mari Cruz! Mari Cruz! At that time, Mary set out and went... to the mountain... in haste to a town of Judah. She entered the house of Zachariah and greeted... "Mary went in haste to the Mountain." What do you think of that? Well...it's an interesting detail. And what are we going to do? How can we forbid all these people from coming here to see the Virgin? You know what? I have to admit that, the other day, when I was with the girls, something strange happened. I went to say something to them... to correct them... and... And what? I can't explain it. When I touched Mari Cruz... It was a weird sensation. She was as stiff as a statue. It wasn't normal, that's for sure. Madre mía. Good afternoon, Father. - Good afternoon. - What a show you have organized! - Who's in charge of the tickets? - And who are you? Doctor Morales. I am a psychiatrist. His Excellency your bishop has put me in charge here, as chief physician of the Investigating Committee. If you're the chief physician, how come you're not with the other experts? Oh, I'm just strolling around, talking with the people... Getting the lay of the land. The girl with braids, she's the one who controls the other three. She's epileptic, maybe a serious case of schizophrenia. Epileptic? Yes, epileptic. I'm going to hypnotize her this evening. You'll see how these "visions" will end today. Schizophrenia? This here is the instrument. You hold it with your fingers. They must stare at it, that's the most important thing. That way, they're more easily hypnotized. So much for the expert! You won't be able to move them. They're having an epileptic fit and get very stiff. Very good, Mama! Today I stacked piles of hay in the meadow for the cows. It was hard work! Fr. Valentín? He's ugly... but he's really nice! Yes, Mama. We like praying for them. For the Civil Guards too, to do a good job of protecting us. Mama, can I wear your crown? Yes! Can I hold the little star? Just for a minute? Then people will believe! Please don't go! You only just got here! Yes, Mama! Stay for longer! So the Virgin is selling cows nowadays, eh? You need to take that rationalist blindfold off your eyes. Wasn't Jesus born in a stable? Why wouldn't the Virgin talk to them about their chores? Okay, I'll take note of all this in my report, and you'll be hearing from me, Brigadier. Tell me. Who have you been talking with? - The Virgin. - The Virgin. - Of Mount Carmel. - Of Mount Carmel? Yes, Mount Carmel. Was She like the statue in the church? Umm...no. So, what was She like? How was She dressed? In white. That's it? She had a blue cape, a white dress, and a crown of little golden stars. And that's all. Nothing else. She had a scapular in her hand. In her left hand. A scapular. In her left hand? - No. - Are you sure? Her right hand. Yes, I'm sure. A scapular in her right hand. In her right hand. Okay. And this Virgin... how did She act? Like a Mother. Like a Mother? Like the best of mothers. You mean, like your mother? No. Like a friend. Well... like a friend, and like the best of mothers. And what else? Well, with Her there were - Two angels. - Two angels. One was Saint Michael and the other I don't know. And the Virgin was holding the Child Jesus. Well, so far... it seems that It's all from God! I have a joke. One guy says to another, "What's your name?" The guy answers, "Peter O'Brien." First guy says, "Make up your mind, man!" Is it Peter, or Brian?" That's a bad joke! I know, I know. Thing is, I have to give a retreat to nuns, and they say that humor is a good teaching method. Otherwise, they will fall asleep! Maybe they're in deep meditation. Saint Teresa talks about mystical dreams. You're so innocent, I wonder if you ever had original sin. Jokes aside, mysticism is really complicated. I still can't believe you got me to come here, with all the things I have to do. We can look at it as a retreat. After examining the girls. God willing. God willing, of course! Anything might happen. An asteroid might hit us, the world might end. Only God knows. How did it go with Fr. Valentín? Good. Good, I said. Although, things are getting a bit complicated. What did Fr. Valentín say to you? Carmen! That man is a bit gullible about these apparitions, and the girls and the Virgin. He must have his reasons. He's a man of God and very wise. Wise, Carmen? He's going around telling everyone the Virgin is appearing to four girls. Do you think that's wise? You believe everything right away, but we have to be prudent. You and your prudence! Carmen, I've just been promoted to brigadier. I don't care about you being a brigadier. I married you because I love you, not for your job. But love doesn't put bread on the table. Thanks for the ride. It was getting dark. No worries, Father. You were still a long way from Garabandal. Isn't there a better road? No, sir. On foot, by mule, or in one of these. Lots of people go up on foot. They say these things are dangerous. So far, I haven't had any accidents. Even so, maybe you should slow down a bit. You're Jesuits, right? That's right. I could tell by the sash. Lots of priests have been coming. Foreigners too. I've seen more Americans these days than in my entire life. Lots of interest, then? You'd better believe it! Everyone wants to see the girls seeing the Virgin. - In ecstasy. - Sorry? It's called ecstasy. If all this is really from God, it means they lose contact with the world and become immersed in God. It's quite common among the saints. Saint Teresa... Well, look, I don't know what the girls are seeing, but I do know what I see. The other day, for example, one of these strangers, bit of a wiseguy, I felt like breaking his legs. came along with a lighted cigarette, and put it out on Jacinta's hand. Amazing thing is, the child didn't even blink. I can't get my head around it. If it's all false, how do they do it? But why would the Virgin come to this village? I wonder... And the way they walk? Backwards and forwards. They know things about people. You'll meet the expert in charge of investigating it all. Doctor Puncernau, he's told me some stuff... about their eyes, their breathing! Watch out! It's broken. Broken? Yes, broken. Beyond all doubt. I can't do much here. You'll have to go to the hospital in Valdecilla tomorrow. We wanted to see the girls, if possible. Impossible, I'm afraid. You'll have to spend the night here, and go to Valdecilla tomorrow. Look, this is all I have. but it will help ease the pain. They're for headaches, so you have a hard night ahead of you. Yes? Father Ramón, sorry it's so late but I have an important message for you. The Virgin has told us your leg will be cured. That's enough, Father, you'll make them dizzy. By the way, have you talked with the girls? I have indeed talked with the girls, one by one. To tell the truth, nothing too big. It's all quite simple, no major revelations. We're getting into a mess here, a huge mess. Hey! What are you doing here? Are you crazy? Actually, he is a bit crazy. - You know them? - It's Father Andreu. His leg is broken and he should be in the hospital. It was broken. It's been healed. - What do you mean healed? How? - The Virgin healed it. What? The Virgin? Show me that foot. Take a good look. Perfect. Like I said yesterday, we were sent here to investigate. If possible, we'd like to interview the girls. Could that be done today? Right now they're with Doctor Puncernau. If we hurry, we could get there in time. But your leg is proof enough. Now, tell me again. At the first call, what happens? You don't hear a voice, right? It's a feeling of joy, is that right? Yes, sir, that's right. And after the first call? A short while goes by before the second one. The first time, it's like She says, "I'm coming." In the second, it's like She says, "Here I come!" And what do you feel at the second call? A great joy. Then we start running. There's not much time between the second and third call. At the third call we get very excited... - and... - Then She's there! Let's do a little test. Okay? What do you think of this? Too soon to tell. There are certain phenomena here which, as a scientist, a doctor, I am unable to explain. - Holy Mary, Mother of God and... - The girls, outside of the ecstasies, are perfectly normal. However, during the ecstasies, they behave differently, so to speak. What do you mean by that, Doctor? Well, for example, the "ecstatic marches", if I may use the term. They walk unaided, but they don't seem to walk. They seem to fly. There is no proportion between their steps and the distance covered. Their physical state is extraordinary. For example, the alterations of weight. When in ecstasy they are like... like stones... - Are you Mary Cruz's father? - I am indeed. I know I can move her, eh? If you want... try it. I told you to try it. And yet, when the girls are in ecstasy, they are able to lift each other up without difficulty. I have noticed that when the girls fall on their knees, they show no sign of pain or harm, even when they fall on stones, or on rocks. And their posture is always... ...modest, right? Are you taking note of all this? Everything. - Are you sending all this...? - To the Bishop. Of course. Since the ecstasies began, he's been taking notes of everything that's happened here. And we send it all on immediately. Another very strange thing is the ability of hierognosis: the capacity to recognize holy objects. For example, one day Conchita was offering the crucifix to be kissed, but she skipped someone. Do you know why? Because he had already blessed himself that morning. He was the only one. He did it every day. So he was the only one who had "done his homework." This is incredible. Sometimes she offers the crucifix to be kissed by everyone. Once, she gave it only to priests, but the thing is, they weren't even dressed as priests. She knew they were disguised as lay people? - Exactly! - Hold on. All this seems very interesting, but I don't know. It might be some kind of a scam, or even a coincidence. It could be, but... we haven't been able to discover any mistake or explanation of how they do it. Believe me, there are things that aren't so easy to explain. Their eyes don't react to lights. It's as if they were looking... - At the Virgin Mary. - I don't know, I can't explain it. Do you think it's from God? Look, let's just watch how things develop. Yes, yes, they're in ecstasy. But they don't usually take objects in these situations. I understand, but she's come so far. Please, Brigadier, let me try. Go on, then, try it. Discreetly, eh? Oh thank you! What a gift for my husband! It's nothing. Ah! I have a ring in my pocket? Who gave it to me? Ah! Okay, kiss it then! It's my ring. Don't forget how much the Virgin loves you. Don't you get annoyed at the mobs of people? The Virgin has always taught us to welcome all those who come. And you really are doing that. By the way, what happened in the apparition today? You didn't seem as joyful as usual. The Virgin gave us a message, but we can't tell it yet, not until October 18th. October 18? Why the long wait? What's it about? It's very important, but She wants us to wait. We can't even tell you, or my mother, or Fr. Valentín. Fair enough. We'll just have to wait. These wedding rings belong to my wife and me. Could you ask the Virgin to kiss them? Of course. Whose idea was it to put that thing along with the rosaries? What is the Virgin going to do with a powder compact? Yeah, I don't think the Virgin used those things. Yes, Mama. We told him You might not like it, but... I told you this was weird. How could She kiss that? - Very well, as usual. - Great! She says She will come back. The powder compact, girl! Did the Virgin kiss it? Yes. It was the first thing She asked for. She said it belonged to Her Son. Yeah right, Her Son's. It's mine. What! This is getting weird. Hey, man! What made you think of giving that thing to the girls? During the Civil War, when many priests were killed, the Eucharist was carried in that compact. Aim! We forgive you, brothers! Fire! So that's why. In that case, yes, it does belong to Her Son. Yes, yes. Manín. Yes, Father. Here are yesterday's reports. By me and Doctor Ortiz. Can you please take them to Fr. Valentín? Yes, of course. How are things with you? Good. But people think I'm the one behind the girls, making it all up. Yeah, and you're making them levitate too, right? Pay no attention to what people say. Just do whatever God asks of you, and that's it. - This whole thing is a pure farce. - You've been here ten minutes. I've been here investigating for four weeks, and I'm still not sure. Doctor Puncernau! This gentleman wishes to speak with you. My pleasure. Let's take a walk. Look, I've been watching these girls for months, and I've seen extraordinary things, things science can't explain. But, Doctor, they talk about everyday, meaningless stuff. I don't know. What do you talk to your mother about? You're not listening to me. These girls talk about their cows and then say it's the Virgin Mary, and everyone believes there are apparitions. They're all crazy. You're not being rational. How do you explain the ecstatic marches? Levitations? Immunity to pain? Lost objects they find guided by the vision? I've seen several miraculous cures already! Look, don't jump to conclusions. Spend a few days here. - Are you seeing the Virgin now? - No, sir. Why not? Holy Mary, Mother of God and our Mother... Father! It's all true! I'm totally convinced. It's really happening! Hold on now. Ten minutes ago you believed nothing. What happened? He had a little encounter with Jacinta. Is that so? What happened? Look. Look. She came... the girl came to give us the crucifix to kiss. And I thought in my mind, in my mind! If this is real, if the Virgin Mary is really appearing, let the ecstasy end. And Jacinta lowered her head, and acted normal again. He's not the only one. It happened to another guy just afterwards. What a pity no one was there from the Committee! Who was the other guy? No idea. Why did you come to Garabandal? Well, truth is, for a long time now, I've had doubts, and I thought coming to Garabandal might give me some answers. - Doubts about the apparitions? - No, no. It's not that. Just, doubts... You see, I'm a priest. But I'm not sure I really am. You're a priest but you're not sure? I don't know if my ordination was valid, if I had the right attitude at the time. What happened this morning didn't help? Yes, of course it did! But... I... need more. - I need to see more. - Okay then, let's go see more. Mother, if I truly am a priest, make the girl, instead of giving me the cross to kiss, make her come and bless me, not like the rest, Mother. That's no good, Mother. She blessed the brigadier too, and he's not a priest. If, instead of that, she had given everyone the crucifix to kiss, without exception, and she blessed me, only me, three times, then there would be no more room for doubt. Yes. Bishop Alfaro, you must go up there tomorrow. Dr. Morales may be partially right in his diagnosis, but it's incomplete. He doesn't explain or even mention so many of the extraordinary things that are happening there. - He lacks... - So you've had time then to get a diploma in neuropsychology as well as qualifying as a brigadier, right? Dr. Morales, in all these months you've only been there three days. You don't even go to see what's happening. You sit in the sacristy, smoking, and mocking what you know nothing about. How can you pronounce judgment on what you haven't seen? Many other doctors and priests have found the girls perfectly normal. Epileptics? Nonsense. You know what? - God will judge you on this. - Brigadier, you are forgetting who Dr. Morales is and his reputation. We should be thankful to him for his patience and attention to such trivial matters. In fact, we have several written testimonies from members of the village faithful to add to his reports. But, Your Excellency, there are many other testimonies. And of those you have, some don't reflect the reality of what's happening. This is a big event, and we're not giving it the importance it deserves. What Fr. Valentín means, Excellency, is that the Committee members have been absent and are unaware of most of the events. They should find out more, ask more people, not just the witnesses they choose. Tomorrow the girls will give a message, is that right? Yes, Your Excellency. The Committee members will be there. Don't worry, everything will be fine. I'm not so sure, Carmen. Who knows what might happen. If something goes wrong, it'll be my fault. My career. Who knows what's ahead. Juan, God knows everything. Trust. Anyway, no matter what happens, you know I'm with you. Fr. Valentín! Good day. How many people have come today to see the girls? Seven or eight thousand. This is getting out of hand, eh? If an episode of mass hysteria occurs, things could get very ugly, very fast. You know, I don't think you're going to like the message. The message? - You know what it says? - Yes, of course. Conchita gave it to me yesterday. - Oh? - Yes, yes. Tonight at 10:30 we must announce it. A bit late. With this rain people won't have enough shelter. You'll have to do it earlier. Well... I suppose doing it a few hours earlier won't do any harm. But... What if it's from God? Let them announce it from the Pines. No, no. The Virgin wants me to read it, here, in front of the church. In front of the church! What are you thinking? You can't implicate the diocese like that. Bishop Alfaro hasn't dictated judgment yet. He's made no declaration on this. Let them do it at the Pines where there's plenty of space for everyone. In front of the church, no. Yes, but... But... the girls... unaccompanied... and the Virgin... There are lots of Civil Guards here. Let them announce it at the Pines. They're the ones who are supposedly having apparitions. You stay out of it. Maybe you're right. I'm sorry. I can't read it. Fr. Valentín. What do you mean you can't read it? The girls said you've been asked to do it. The Virgin said you must read it in front of the church. Yes, but... But... Have you seen how many people there are? And the bishop. The bishop hasn't given a clear statement on the matter. Look, I think it's best to separate what the apparition says on the one hand and what the Church is saying. So, who's going to read it? Read it yourselves. We must make many sacrifices, do much penance, and visit the Blessed Sacrament. But first, we must be very good. Otherwise, a chastisement will befall us. - Louder! - We can't hear! The cup is already filling up, and if we do not change, a very great chastisement will come upon us. - What are they saying? - I can't hear a thing! Please, we can't hear! Vergara! And this must be the famous Dr. Morales! Congratulations on your appointment! Yes, yes, thank you, but please, take a seat. Talk to me. Let's get directly to business. Well, really, I just wanted to introduce you to Dr. Morales and discuss the situation in San Sebastián de Garabandal. Garabandal. If you knew how many letters I am receiving from Spain and abroad asking for clarification of the situation. From you, I need clarity and decisiveness. Is that clear? I'm not concerned about the reaction. I already know that people who go there will suffer greatly if I don't put a stop to it. From what I hear, people are already beginning to express disappointment. Exactly. People expected something much bigger, a miracle. And they feel let down. The message was clearly written by the girls. It's so basic. It looks like an attempt by them to revive the situation. It seems the families are obtaining certain benefits and, naturally, they will try to re-activate things. - They've already made an announcement. - Of what? Of a miracle. A miracle, with a date and all. People are very simple and gullible, easy to convince. It's obvious that the girls are totally unstable. They need neuropsychological treatment. This won't stop until you make a public declaration. To do that I need witnesses and proof. Nothing to worry about, then. That job is already done. Aniceta, how is Conchita? Just fine, as usual. But... She's giving problems at home? No, she's very well-behaved. Has been since all this began, to be honest. It's just that, lately, she's been saying something that worries me. What is it? It seems the Virgin told her that... Hi, Conchita. Hi, Mom. Hello. Hello, Brigadier, how are you? Me? Just fine, thank God. Your mother has fed me a magnificent breakfast. In fact, I came early this morning to speak with you, and your mom told me you were on the Path praying the rosary, in the freezing cold! The Virgin asked us to. We want to do it to please Her. A glass of hot milk? No, thanks. Don't think they're in ecstasy praying the rosary at five in the morning. If they were, they wouldn't arrive home every day shaking with the cold. Isn't it hard to wake up so early, Conchita? Well, it's a little hard sometimes but, as She says, we must make many sacrifices, so we're happy to do it. Okay, thank you for coming, but now I must get ready for school. The Virgin has told her... she will deny everything. Look, Aniceta, many people think the girls wrote the message, you know? And that worries me, because some people are against all this. I must admit I have my doubts too, but I also have very special moments. I don't know. I'd like to speak with Father Andreu. Conchita! Yes? Listen. Nothing. - You're off to school, right? - Yes. Off you go then. Have a good day. You too. Bye. You have to open your heart to the Virgin. I understand your doubts, but the proofs are plenty. And you've seen a lot of them firsthand! - You're in a privileged position. - I know, Father, I know. - But it's hard to believe. - Of course it's hard. You have to make a little leap of faith. But God gives us enough light to see the step He asks us to take. Look, there's one thing I can tell you for sure: There's nothing in the apparitions that goes against the faith of the Church. Isn't that what the Gospel is for? Why should the Virgin appear at all then? Because She loves us and wants to show us She is our Mother. Do you know She even plays hide-and-seek with the girls? She comes to remind us of Christ's message, not to add anything to it. Ask Her to help you, to open your heart to the graces She wants to give you. Don't be afraid. Excuse me, how long will this take? When will there be an ecstasy? We're staying in Cosío and have to leave soon. Ma'am, you can't force these things. But don't worry, I don't think it'll take long. Hey, pray! Come on, please. Come on, pray, please. Pray to the Virgin, hurry up! Hey, look! A little present from the Virgin. I told you. Ah, wonderful! She came! We're so blessed! Did you see that? Of course I saw it. Why? They're not really seeing the Virgin. What do you mean they're not seeing the Virgin? - How can you say that? - Conchita, come here! Come! What a coincidence, right? Just when the visitors were leaving the Virgin arrived. They're so lucky, right? Well, yes. And you girls had nothing to do with it? Well... Since the Virgin was going to come anyway, and we didn't want to disappoint people, we moved a little, and... But, Conchita! So you faked it! Yes, but just for a moment. You can't do that! Do you realize how many people are against you? Saying all this is false? And then you give them reasons not to believe! Sorry, we just wanted them to believe. Look, Conchita, that might seem better sometimes, but the truth is always best! By trying to give people these experiences, you can harm other people, harm them in their faith. I think I'll wait for the next call at home. Nothing good will come from this. But look at her. I'm sure she wanted to do good, but this could help some people to bury all this. Angels can't consecrate, Álvarez. Don't you think they are trying to regain people's attention? No. The girls haven't said the Angel consecrates the hosts. They say the Angel takes the consecrated hosts from a tabernacle. And he never brings Communion to the village when a priest is there. Won't there be priests the day of the miracle? Why should the Angel come then? There probably will be priests that day in the village. But, Doctor, this is something special the Virgin wants to do so that people will believe. Look here, Álvarez. This is coming to an end. You realize that, don't you? The girls have been convincing, some times more than others, but let's be honest. Fr. Valentín told us they have faked ecstasies. And how do you know all the ecstasies haven't been fake? Yes, it's true that some ecstasies were fake. But very few. And there have been thousands of ecstasies and extraordinary events that have no explanation other than a divine intervention. Look, Álvarez, we are here for the good of the people, to serve the bishop, and to let you know this is coming to an end. His Excellency is about to make a declaration. We just need to collect a few more testimonies, but really... We don't want to see you associated with all this when it falls apart. You are a good man. Very good. You've been very close to the girls. Like a father to them. But it's probably best that you remove yourself from it all. So that you're not in the boat when the storm hits. - They say tomorrow there'll be... - Yeah, yeah, we know. A miracle, right? What? Like the last one? Anyway, we'll be there. How could you not be there? How could you miss an announced event like that? You're the Investigating Committee! I remind you that, last time, a calamity was avoided thanks only to us. That's absurd. Prestigious doctors like Dr. Puncernau have stated there was no hint of mass hysteria. You fixed nothing, because there was nothing there that needed fixing. Look, Álvarez, when you get close to the people involved and wish to help them, it's very difficult to be objective. We have watched from a distance to see things rationally, not with our sentiments. Think of your reputation. Look towards your future. Madre mía, what a mess! We're in for some big trouble! People are saying there's going to be a riot! Some of them think it's a hoax. Others are saying who knows what! But look at her. Look at her face. Looking at that face, do you think she's done something that bad? Oh Lord. You must protect her! No promises, Aniceta. It's not going to be easy to keep her safe. Who the heck knows. I can't promise anything. I don't like this at all. I'm scared they might knock her down. Give me your word you'll protect her. If that miracle doesn't happen, they'll kill us all. Don't worry, Aniceta. We'll protect her. You have my word. Let's go, come on. And you, you were there? Yes, I was there. What did you see? - Well... - Did you see the host, yes or no? Yes. The girl had it hidden in her hands when she knelt down. I don't know exactly when or how but, suddenly, she put it on her tongue. It's obvious. She availed of the darkness, the crowd, and there you have it, the miracle. People will believe anything. Have no doubt that we will take action. You have performed a great service to the truth. The Investigating Committee in charge of studying the events occurred in the village of San Sebastián de Garabandal declares that the phenomena lack all evidence of a supernatural nature. and can be explained by natural causes. And I'm a bullfighter. We forbid all priests, diocesan and non-diocesan, and all religious, even those heretofore exempt, from travelling to the aforesaid place. We repeat to all the faithful the warning that they must abstain from fomenting the atmosphere created by the development of these events and that, therefore, they must desist from visiting the said village with this motive. In a matter of such gravity we expect from all a prompt conformity with these instructions. Is that it then? We just walk away? After all we've seen. All we've been through, and you're not going to do anything! Do you know when I began to believe? When I received this. From the very beginning I sent reports to the Bishop's office on everything that was happening here. Everything. Testimonies. Do you know what they did with them? They threw them in the trash. To top it off, they sent me this letter: "Put an end to all this" "and stop sending paperwork." As if I were the one making all this up! We have to talk with the Committee again. The Committee has never wanted to talk with us! And after what they've achieved now, even less. We can do no more. God knows we've tried. Brigadier! We're looking for the parish priest, Fr. Valentín. Could you help us find him? Yes, I know Fr. Valentín. But he's a bit busy right now. Can you wait? Well, we're leaving shortly. But perhaps you could pass on a message to him. - Only for him, and with discretion. - You have my word. What is it? Well, a brother of ours, Fr. Justo, was here the other day. Yes, I recall seeing him here. But he stayed away from the apparitions. Yes, well, I bring his formal apology. He didn't wish to come in person. Apology? But, for what? He hasn't been able to sleep for three days tormented by what he's done. He gave a false testimony to the Bishop about the miracle that occurred here the other day. He said the whole thing was a scam, that the girl took the host from her pocket. A scam? So this man lied? Does he not realize the serious damage he's done? He does, and he is deeply sorry. He begs forgiveness. Alright. I'll pass on the message to Fr. Valentín. Hi. Hi, Conchita. Lots of people don't believe, you know. She told us that even we ourselves would deny Her. I didn't believe it, but now, I'm not sure. I feel that I've deceived people. What do you think? I don't know, Conchita. I don't know what to think. Look, when I see you in ecstasy, talking with the Virgin, and in other extraordinary situations, how can I not believe? But other times... I don't know. I have lots of doubts. Do you know what She said when I asked Her about the Bishop's letter? She just smiled. Conchita. We are important men. We are very busy. You have just admitted it a couple of minutes ago: it was all a lie. Not the calls. Or the miracle. Sometimes, I'm not sure. It's been so long, I don't know. Don't think too much about it. It was all a lie. We don't want to have to excommunicate you. You don't understand? No. What's "discommunicate"? When a person is very disobedient and tells lots of lies, the authorities must be firm. You won't be able to receive Communion, or absolution of your sins. And, when you die, they won't be able to bury you in a cemetery. They'll bury you outside, like a dog. Do not doubt that my Son will perform a miracle. Hi, Mama. It's been ages since you last came. I missed you. You know many people don't believe any more. It's been a long time now since the girl had an apparition, you know? I always believed she saw the Virgin... And since the miracle, I've been faithful. If all those who laugh at the girls had seen what you and I have seen, they'd be singing another tune. That's for sure. She says it won't be the Virgin this time, but the angel, and there'll be a second message. You'd better get your troops ready, because there's going to be trouble. Conchita, have you seen the crowds of people who've come to the village? It's all I can think of! And are you sure you're going to see the angel? Positive. At what time? That I can't tell you, because I don't know. What will the angel say? I'm not sure. Probably another message. But I don't know, we'll have to wait. So, where's it going to happen? - Gumersindo - Present, sir! Go tell all the people to head for the Path, slowly. Above all, they must keep order! Conchita, what should we do now? Head for the Path, like everyone else. Let's go then. Here comes Conchita. No. No! Not yet! Forgive them, forgive! Priests? Bishops? July 2? Yes, yes. Exactly. I want her treated just like the rest. Yes. Precisely. That's why we've changed her name. No one can speak with her without my explicit permission. No one. - María. - Yes? You have visitors in the meeting room. Good morning, Conchita. Good morning, Your Excellency. I am very sorry for taking you out of class. What were you studying? History. History! I find history fascinating. - Don't you? - Well, it's okay. It's okay! It's more than okay. So... I imagine you have guessed why we've come here today, right? And I suppose you know Fr. José. Yes. How could she not know her parish priest? I've been there a short while, but we're good friends, right? We need your help, your cooperation. How can I help you? We need you to tell us the truth, everything you told Fr. José a couple of weeks ago in the village, before coming here. We've already spoken with the other girls. We've talked with Mari Cruz, Mari Loli, with Jacinta. They told us many things. - Many. - Mama, we love you so much! So much, Mama! Do you want to tell us something too? What a message the Virgin Mary gave you. It's quite intense, isn't it? So intense that for a little girl to make it up she would have to be... What did the Virgin say? What did She say? What happened? Since "my" message of October 18 has not been heeded and made known to the world, I tell you that this is my last message. Since my message of October 18 has not been heeded and made known to the world, I tell you this is my last message. Before, the cup was filling up, Now, it is overflowing. Many priests... Many priests... Now, here, here's my favorite part, right... Many priests, and bishops too, right? are following the way to perdition, and are taking many souls with them. Look, little girl. Do you really think the Virgin could have said something like this? You yourself invented it. You're a liar. Many priests are following the way to perdition, and are taking many souls with them. Less and less importance is being given to the Eucharist. You should turn the wrath of God away from you by your efforts. If you ask for His forgiveness with sincere hearts, He will forgive you. I, your Mother, through St. Michael the Archangel, ask you to amend your lives. You are now in the last warnings! I love you very much, and I do not want your condemnation. Pray to Us sincerely and We will grant your requests. You should make more sacrifices. Meditate on the Passion of Jesus. Now, once and for all, Conchita: did you see the Virgin Mary in San Sebastián de Garabandal? Conchita, many people are not going to like this, you realize that? Yes, I know. I don't fully understand it myself, but if the Virgin said it, it's true. Are you okay? Yes. Just a little confused at what She said about us denying Her. You know what, Conchita. Even if at some point you doubt and deny everything, I can never deny what I've seen, all the things I've lived here. And if you deny it, in some moment of doubt, or confusion, or darkness, or even deep suffering, it wouldn't change anything for me. Hello, Conchita. Hello, Mama. I've brought you these rosaries to kiss. So I see. Conchita, do you remember what I told you on your Saint's feast day, that you would suffer much on earth? Well, I say it to you again. Trust in Us and offer it gladly to our Hearts for the good of others, uniting yourself more to Us. Conchita, I have not come for you alone. I have come for all my children, to bring them closer to Our Hearts. Talk to me, Conchita, talk to me about my children. They are all under my mantle. It's very small. We can't all fit. Do you understand, Conchita, why I did not come on June 18 to give you the message for the world? It was because it pained me to say it to you, but I must say it to you, for your good, and God's glory, if you heed it. I love you so much and I desire your salvation. Conchita, will you at least respond? If only I could always see you, then yes, but otherwise, I don't know, I'm very bad. Just do your best and We will help you. The same goes for my daughters Loli, Jacinta, and Mari Cruz. Conchita, why don't you visit my Son more often in the Blessed Sacrament where He is waiting for you day and night? This is the last time you will see Me here, but I will always be with you and all my children. Oh, how happy I am when I see you! Why don't you take me with you now? Remember what I told you on your Saint's feast day. When you come before God, your hands must be filled with good works done for others and God's glory, and now they are empty. But I will be with you always and with all my children. Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us today the chief physician of the Investigating Committee of the phenomena of Garabandal: Doctor Morales. Thank you. Thank you very much. Everything we know about Garabandal, everything you have been told, everything the Bishops have condemned throughout the past twenty years, is based on reports by the Committee set up to study the events. It's based on my reports. Today I am going public. Those reports do not reflect the truth. The Bishop and I have agreed that I should tell you three things: that Garabandal is true; that it should be placed on the same level as Fatima and Lourdes; and that the experiences of the girls were objectifications of subjective experiences. I wish to ask also that the case of San Sebastián de Garabandal be re-opened to new studies. Because... what happened there was... absolutely inexplicable.
