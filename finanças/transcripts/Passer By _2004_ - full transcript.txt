That is true. I'm telling you. And as all young Aussies and Kiwis come over here to save the NHS and spend their agency money doing cheap flights to Barcelona and Prague on their weekends off... Roger here is going the other way, buggering off to Australia. Obviously, a man who will do anything to get out of his rota. Anyway, the Radiography Department's loss is... What exactly are they gaining by having you? Uh, it's weird actually that we only all get together like this when we're losing someone. But before I start getting all maudlin and telling him that I'm going to miss him, which, by the way, mate, I will. Aw. Something to remember us by. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. The 11:31 is about to depart from Platform 4, calling at all stations to Hertsmere. That's the 11:31, Platform 4, to Hertsmere. Oh, hi, it's me. I didn't wake you, did I? Ironing? Sorry. Yeah, it was good. Oh, yeah, we gave him a good send-off. No. Why, do I sound it? Well, maybe a bit. All right. Look, I'll see you in about, I don't know, about quarter to. Okay, bye. Is that Snake you're playing? Yes, it is. -What sort of level you on? -Middle. -You doing a maze? -No. I do the top level. Any maze you like. -I'm a genius at that game. -Really? John, shut up, you're embarrassing yourself, mate. Sorry. Not a very English thing to do, is it? Showing the slightest bit of interest in your fellow human beings. Sorry, he's a bit merry. Oh, my God! I've spoken to a girl on the train. I'll wake up in the morning full of shame! Oh, I didn't really do that, did I? Oh, my God, call yourself an Englishman! You've really let the side down. We all make mistakes, especially when we've been drinking. Oh, no, it's not just a bit of fooling around. We're having full conversation and we haven't even used any protection. It's all right, though. I don't talk around, and I bet you don't make a habit of it either. I'll shut up now. Manual dexterity, the old fingers and thumbs, that's me. You should see how fast I can send a text message. Should I? Yeah, call out your number and I'll send you one. -Oh, what? -What? That's one way of getting her phone number. It's not like that, I promise you. Nothing pre-what's-a-name about it at all. -Premeditated? -Thank you. Nothing Roy Keane about it at all. A practical demonstration, that's all. How quick off the draw I am. I believe you. -So? -No. Knock-back! Could I send you a text message instead? Just to prove that there's no... Hidden agenda. Oh, thank God, there's articulate people on this train. I was just gonna call it "funny business." But just to prove to this young lady here... I'll tell you what, Snake, right? You do it on yours, I'll do it on mine then we can compare, or you could just sit back and admire me. The next station will be Wellingham. Don't worry, he's getting off in a minute. This is Wellingham. Will all passengers departing at this station please make sure you take your belongings with you? It's not my stop. Oh. You win. Just having a laugh, that's all. Bad loser? -Yeah. -Bet you can't park, either. Bet you don't signal, bet you just cut right over. -Bit of a tongue on her! -You hope. - No hope. - I'm gutted. Oh, bollocks, no audience for that one. Except you, eh? Just as well. All ball-breakers these days, don't you reckon? So where have you been tonight, then? Working. But you've been drinking. I had a few glasses when we closed. -Where do you work, then? -In a restaurant. -Waitress? -Manager. Would you give me a good table? You'd have to book. -Is it expensive? -Quite expensive. - Is your service good? - Well, it has to be. Think you could give me a good service? You've upset her now. Have I? If this was my restaurant, I'd be bringing you the bill. Oh, sorry, Miss My Restaurant's Quite Expensive. It's no wonder we don't talk to each other, eh? You get a flea in your ear when you try. Bit of banter, and suddenly you're bang in trouble. Do you forgive me? The silent treatment. Have I gone invisible all of a sudden? Obviously, I have. Perhaps if I get a bit closer, she'd be able to, like, sense me. What do you reckon? Well, your charm ain't got you anywhere so far, has it? Some women can't resist a bastard, though, can they? Could you resist a bastard? Like, if I said, "Give me your mobile number like the slut you are." Nice! Come on, I'll punch you in. Your number, I mean. Look, I've got no intention of giving you my mobile number, okay? Come on, fellas... What are you getting out of your pram for? We're only having a giggle with this young lady here. It's nothing for you to worry about. Get back to your Walkman. Thought he was going to make a citizen's arrest there for a minute. Yeah. Anyway, like I said, it's just the old mating ritual. I'm just trying to show her my feathers, mate, all right? If I show you my feathers, will you show me your flaps? Oh, sorry, sorry. Completely out of order. I didn't choose me words properly there. Oh, yes, you did. So the engagement's off then, is it? The next station will be Fulton. That was a joke, by the way. A smile would have been appreciated. Oh, look, the party pooper's going. We can let our hair down now, Wayne. What, just have a laugh? Excuse me. They're just drunk, being silly. See? If you do need assistance... Yeah. See ya later, mate. Hello? Oh, hello, I've just got off the last Fulton train. There were a couple of guys on it getting a bit... I didn't do anything because... Well, I wasn't sure what to do, to be honest. This is Information, mate. If you want to press emergency... Well, I don't know, it was probably something or nothing. What was it, something or nothing? Look, it's not important, all right? Forget it. Sorry to waste your time. How was his send-off? Good. Is that it? Oh, I don't know. I was thinking, if I don't get that Super 2 post in A&E, I might as well be having a leaving do of me own. Well, you won't get promoted with an attitude like that and a face like a smacked arse. Sorry. How was the journey home? Oh, you know. Late-night pissheads being obnoxious. Next time, I might splash out on a cab. No, you bloody won't. I won't be going out for a bit, anyway. Obviously, it doesn't agree with you, the funny mood you're in. I'm just tired. Anyway, darling, give us a cuddle and I'll be right as rain. A cuddle's all you're getting, Grumpy. Cuddle's are all I can manage. Dr Khan to reception, please. Phone call for Dr Khan. Dad. Dad, what about my window? -Did you fix it? -I fixed it. Cos it wouldn't open properly. Well, now it does, so you can poke your head through and ogle at Ryan next door. -Ooh! -Ryan? He's got a skateboard! Dad, don't be embarrassing, all right? That'll take longer to fix. Helen, where did you go? Helen? What am I, a camel? Only your breath. How was the pizza? I should have got some Valium from work and stuck it in their Diet Cokes. You know, they're gonna be up till 2:00, don't you? Screaming and eating those yoghurts you have to suck. I don't care. Nothing's going to keep me awake. I'll be sleeping the sleep of the righteous. Where's Reece? Carjacking, joy riding, shooting policemen in the head and killing old ladies who get in the way. He really should get out more. Or staying in a way that's less disgusting. I think his bedroom's starting to sprout mushrooms. Am I telling him? He really respects the way that you threaten and swear at him. That's natural authority, I'll have you know. What are you doing? What have you done? Oh, I can't believe this! Did you see what level I was on? I'll have to go back to the beginning now! Oh, shit! Oi! You won't even be getting that far. Oh, so when do I get it back, then? When there's no crisp packets in the pillows, no bits of bubble gum on the window that have somehow got pubic hair stuck on them, and no trace of that sticky stuff you've wiped on your Jennifer Love Hewitt poster. Shut up! I'm just jealous, mate. Now, this memory card, you don't want me to forget where I put it, do you? Thank you for your co-operation. You could have some mates stay, you know? I don't want them to mess my room up. I wish you'd do that in the bathroom, you know? The light's better in here. Oh, that's breakfast, is it, chocolate yoghurt? Make me bacon and eggs, then. Darling, if I had the time... Joe, it's a joke. "Darling, if I had the time." Isn't it about time you got going? Yeah. Listen, I'm replacing those games you got upstairs with a chemistry set. I'm not running to school, so? Don't stress your dad out, he's got a big interview today. That's why he's wearing that nasty suit. Darling, don't buy any more of those chocolate yoghurts. They're full of crap. Listen, Ayatollah, do you want me to wish you luck or not? I'm just trying to set some standards in this house. The department's very dependent on agency staff at the moment, and that makes man management even more important. You know, trying to get some loyalty. Some "We're all in it together" mentality into people who can quite easily come and go. You know, "I'm temporary, it's nothing to do with me." And what makes you think that you can motivate them to be part of a team? By showing them they don't have to do the job on their own. Juniors have to seek advice and seniors have to give it. To be honest, if you don't share, you don't bloody care, and that's got no place here. Are you sure we can afford to have this done? Helen, I'm about to become management. Don't count your chickens, you, or we could end up with a two-foot wall instead of an extension. Stick with me, kid, I'm going places. Oh. Listen, there was a message while you were in there. You need to go home. He admitted he didn't have a reason to be out of school. And normally, he would return, and be simply refused. Then he ran away from us, but we don't chase children. Later, we found him in an amusement arcade. What's going on? - Have you done this before? - No. Is it a subject you don't like? If it keeps happening, we may have to follow it up. What do you mean, "follow it up"? The possibility of court action. Oh, come on, he's only 14. We mean the possibility of court action against you two. Us? You are his parents. Who do you think we are, though, Mr and Mrs Fagin? You think we approve of him wandering the streets? Well, I hope not. I hope you take a very dim view of it, some don't. Look, mate, I work in the NHS, my wife here is a classroom assistant, we believe in... Well, we take our responsibilities very seriously. And this is a one-off thing, it's an aberration. Yeah, well, whatever's been going on here, I'd get to the bottom of it if I were you. Okay. We need the truth to come out, Reece. Because if it doesn't, you're just going to do it again, and me and your dad will both end up in the dock for being crap parents. Do you want that? When they approached you, you refused to go back and you ran. What's so scary about school all of a sudden? -I'm not scared of anyone! -Are you sure? I'm not owning up to anything. I haven't seen you with your mobile lately. -I lent it to someone. -You've had it taken off you. Look, just leave me alone! Joe, can you stop him? Go on, up you go. Well, you were dynamic, weren't you? I can't shout the odds all the time, Helen. Do you think someone's been hurting him? -There's usually more than one. -Don't, Joe. I'm just saying. How could we not know about something like that? Well, he's at an age where he's starting to have secrets. It shouldn't matter how old he is, Joe. We didn't bring them up to hide stuff. We tell each other things in this family, don't we? Once again, the vehicle we're looking for is a tan or Grey Toyota... -What's this you're watching? -Some crime thing. A woman attacked in some woods in Scotland, just taking her dog for a walk. Why are you letting her watch this for? Mum said I could stay up. Not to have your head filled with this stuff. -At least she'll be wiser. -She's 11. She's growing up! Is this what she's got to look forward to? Stop it. It's only a television programme. I'll put something else on. I like having a cuddle with Mum. Anyway, it's all well and good, you policing the telly, why don't you get upstairs again and see what he's doing? He won't open the door. He will when he needs the loo. When he stormed upstairs, he took two cartons of Ribena with him. You make me feel like an amateur. Yeah, well, practice makes perfect. The truth, as research has recently shown, is quite different. Round Two. Fight! I win. I win. Can I play? Are you the same character every time? Depends on who I'm fighting. Me and your mum... we're in your corner, you know? Look, whatever's going on at school, I don't want you getting involved, all right? Oh, Reece, I have to do something. What kind of dad would I be if I didn't, eh? So I'm going to talk to your head teacher first. But I'm going to need to know everything that's been happening to you. That means you telling me, son. Better out than in, eh? This is the Metropolitan Police Crimestoppers unit at New Scotland Yard. You have contacted us because you wish to remain anonymous. Therefore, your call will not be traced, nor will it be taped. Your anonymity will be guaranteed. A detective will answer your call shortly. Come on, come on. I gave him the pin number of my credit card. I even did that thing about having a period. He wasn't swayed. He told me to kiss him back, I did. I didn't want to die. I didn't scream, I didn't fight, I wasn't a have-a-go hero. I took his word for it about the knife he was carrying. There was no skin under my nails. Nothing. I just let him... have his way. None of that makes you any less of a victim, Alice. And at Victim Support, we're not interested in making judgements like that anyway. I'm not interested in being a victim. I've got exactly the same mobile as the one called John had, so I remembered that. And this guy called John, he called the other one Wayne. He was the quieter one. Um... I don't know where they got on because I didn't notice them straight away, but I can confirm the descriptions of them both that have been put out. And that's it, really. That's all I want to say. I'm going to hang-up now, okay? If you want to ring back with anything else you think is pertinent, or that you remember, then I'll give you a code number unique to yourself, okay? A code number? If any of your information is instrumental in leading to an arrest, then you might be entitled to a reward. If you are, you'll be asked to call back later using that code. A reward? No, thanks. No, not interested. Bye. -Who were you ringing? -I'm done now. Ready for your man. I don't need a chaperone. I want to know what you're going to say to him. How's that all going to come out? -How you've been the victim of... -"Victim"? All right, then, how you've suffered abuse... I didn't tell you, okay? I didn't say anything. You found out. All right, then, we'll say that the welfare officer and the police put us onto it. -I wouldn't tell them! -Well, what then? You read a text message on my phone when I wasn't there, saw some other ones that I hadn't erased, then you forced me to give their names. You made me. And what did these messages say? Just nasty. Abusive? Threatening? Yeah, all right. Why do they do it, Reece? They just do. Why are you asking me this? -Well, because you're the one. -No, they're the ones. Of course. I don't ask for it. No, of course not, of course not. Look, leave this with me. Reece was very reluctant to make a fuss about this. That's part of the problem we face with this kind of thing. Put a brave face on it, even when he was caught truanting. Well, now it's out in the open. Because I couldn't sit back and do nothing. Well, I appreciate the fact that you came straight to me. Who else would I go to? Some aggrieved mums and dads make a beeline straight for the other pupil's parents, confront them outside, go to their houses, smash windows, paint on cars, punch-ups. Yeah, well, I'm a reasonable man. No direct action. That's my job. I'm just glad you've had such a responsible approach. If I was really responsible, I'd be bashing their bastard heads in! Sorry. You're upset. It's my son. Like I said, I'll deal with it. You've absolutely done the right thing. Mission accomplished, Reece. Hey, what was all that shouting about? Me laying down the law a bit. Having a go at the Head? Nice one. -Pretend you're getting me round the neck. -What? Just pretend you're playing. -That better? -Yeah. Joe. Right, we've done the front view... and now we're going to do sideways, okay? -All right? -Yeah. I'll just be a second. I'm really sorry. You know, it had been a long day. I'd had a few drinks. I didn't really clock what was going on until it was nearly time to get off the train. And then, I saw that police sign. It might not even be the same woman. Do you reckon? Well, why not? Same men, but someone else they came across, not her necessarily. Maybe. Look, you did all that could be expected of you. You spoke up, but obviously when they threatened you... I had to think twice. Well, what's wrong with that? If you'd done something and they'd pulled a knife... And guys like that usually are carrying something. Exactly. And I'd be expecting you home, and then, all of a sudden, I'd have a visit -from the police saying... -Yeah, yeah. But as for her... I know. But she seemed quite capable, you know? Independent, ballsy, money. And she had a mobile with her, so she could have made sure there was someone to meet her at the other end or got off when I did or asked me to... You just don't think of those things at the time, do you? I didn't know how to seriously take any of it. Yes, you didn't know what was gonna happen. Look, Joe, if you knew something had to be done, you'd have done it. That's what you're like. Yeah. I'm too soft with you. You should be having that after your dance class, not before it. Keeps my sugar levels up, energy levels. Mum, what are you doing? Hang on. Mum, come on. Wait! We're going to be late. -Ah, they gave it back to you, did they? -Yeah. You see, your dad goes in there, has a word with the Head, the little bastards fall into line. I am the man! Louise, come and get your supper. If I can't give up, at least I won't do it in the house. This is going to take months, isn't it? What's wrong? Why haven't you gone forward? -How do you mean? -As a witness. I didn't witness anything. But you were there, Joe. I was just on the train, that's all. Even if it's just to give a description. I'm just surprised you haven't already done it, especially seeing all those yellow police boards. -I rang Crimestoppers. -Did you? When? A few days ago. But wouldn't an actual statement be better? Probably. Well, then... I've left it a bit late now, haven't I? What? -Not if it helps catch them. -I know. Will you come with me? Joe? I can't do this. It'll just be a statement. They'll be grateful for it. But it's been over a week already... and suddenly, I decide to slither in there, like some crap excuse for a man. Joe, they're not gonna question your timing. But I might say more than I meant to, Helen. I might say that I was sitting there watching all this go on and all I could think was "I want to go home." When she looked at me and I could see her fear, I just thought "Bollocks. "I get the luxury of one night out "and suddenly, I'm expected to be responsible "for someone I don't even know!" But that's not you, that's never you. Well, apparently, it can be. Well, they're not going to be interested in any of that, so don't tell them it. But what do you make of it, Helen? Just get in there and get involved now. -So is that it, then? -Yep, that's it. Have you made any arrests? We've got a couple of suspects in custody, yeah. -Have they confessed? -No, not yet. But I think your statement should help change all that when they know about it. I just wish I'd come forward sooner. Feeling more like your old self now? I keep wondering how she's doing. Me, too. You are formally committed to appear before a Crown Court on a date to be fixed to stand trial. Your bail is continued under the same terms. You may stand down. So what happens now? Next thing you know I'll be running the Neighbourhood Watch round here. Magistrate even. As long as it makes her feel better about going to trial. As long as it makes her feel better about human nature. Not all men are bastards, eh? Not this one, anyway. What was that? Shall I phone the police, Joe? Shit. Oi! Hey! Hey! -Some kids. -What kids? I don't know, Reece. Obviously, just trying their luck. Saw the skip outside and thought there might be an easy way in. -I don't know. -Shall we call the police? No. No, there is no point. They won't come out for an attempted burglary. I've been telling you for years we need an alarm. That won't deter a couple of druggies looking for a video to flog. They won't come back, will they? Darling, they wouldn't dare. Not with your old man here. Come on, let's get to bed. Thank you, thank you. Just goes to prove that not all managers are faceless bureaucrats. They can be hard working, full of charisma and dedicated to the idea of public service. And of course, be able to bung the odd £50 note here and there to the interviewing panel. So what's your first move going to be then, Joe? To create a sense of harmony and well-being. Ooh, steady on! Ah, don't worry, it will all emanate from my persona. Back to work. Thank you. About bloody time is all I can say. -Speech! -I think he just made it, darling. -Well done. -I'm on a roll. Dad, can I have some? Oh, go on, son. No. What do you think you're doing, Reece? Reece, that is not how you drink champagne. I'm in management now. I know that sort of thing. It makes you drunk quicker than anything, doesn't it? You can get really out of it. Well, that won't be you tonight. Why not? And the best thing about all of this is that those bloody A&E consultants are going to have to listen to me from now. -Respect. -Big him up! Toast. -To... -Toasts are lame. Reece! I'm just trying to get merry. Get drunk on the atmosphere, can't you? You know, be happy. Well, I'm not complaining, am I? Oh, here, look, have some. Most of it'll come out of his nose anyway. And I don't care if toasts are lame, we'll have one. To... Bloody hell, don't tempt fate. Let's just settle for cheers, then. Cheers. "What do you call a man "who hits someone over the head with a Weetabix?" A cereal killer. Now, come on. Do you need some credit for your phone? -Not bothered. -Why not? What's wrong? But they said you wouldn't have to appear. -They told you. -Yeah. Well, I do now. Surely it's not compulsory. It's a summons, Helen. Are you in trouble, Dad? No, no. Not me, son. But I got the impression that my statement was enough, and now this. And to be honest with you, I'm not mad about the idea, okay? Your evidence is needed in court, Mr Keyes. But why? Look, why do you think you need to appear? Because they're pleading not guilty. And in a rape case, Mr Keyes, what's that usually about? Consent. Honest belief and all that. Your testimony will show that what happened on the train that night wasn't exactly Blind Date. And it won't just be their word against hers, will it? If you're there. No, no, I suppose you're right. I'm just not particularly looking forward to coming face to face with them again. Well, at least you'll be able to face her now, eh? Look, it might not be too bad. Bloody dust is still getting in everywhere. I've only got to remember what I said in my statement. I'll need to hoover as well. I've already done the hard part, going forward, in the first place. Oh, you think that's the hard part, do you? -You wanted me to help her. -I know. Those men, they're out on bail now, aren't they? How do you know? And they know a witness has made a statement, don't they? They know it's you. They probably know where you live, and you know what they're capable of. Come on. Where did you get all this from? And now's a good time for them to really get going. Your imagination's running all over the bloody place, Helen. I've seen them. What? I went to the committal hearing. I suppose I just wanted to... To see whether my statement was sufficient? No! We've never been involved in anything like this before. I wanted to see them sent on their way, up close, but safely. And the way one of them looked at me, Joe... Well, what do you want me to do, fail to appear? What would happen to you if you did? What do you think would happen to me? I'm sorry, I know. I just didn't think it would have to go this far. This stand up and be counted thing's not that easy, is it? So I go up there and do the whole, you know, "I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth..." And nothing but the truth. You've appeared a few times yourself, have you? And swear on the Bible. I won't say the "F" word. It's a big thing your dad's being asked to do, you know. Wants to do. It's horrible what those men have done. Innocent until proven guilty, apparently. Not by the time you've finished. Well, the victim's giving evidence, too. Did they threaten to kill you, Dad, when you told them to leave her alone? Well, they weren't pleased, I'll put it that way. But that didn't stop you, did it? Not a bit of it. The best bit, though. The best bit will be when you look across at them in the dock, and you just stare back at them when they're trying to screw you out, and you're, like, all defiant, cos you know what you're going to say is going to send them down. See their faces when it ain't two against one, see their faces then. All right, Reece, too much television. No heroics, just how it was, and we'll let the law do the rest. I just don't like the idea of you being in there on your own. -You'd make me self-conscious. -Don't look at me, then. Anyway, I might be hanging around for hours, so would you. Yeah, you're right. You might not even get called today. All right, that's settled, then. Look, I know you're nervous, but just stick to your guns, eh? -Yes, Sarge. -And don't let anyone... Listen to me, I was going to say, "Put you off", and I was one of them. I'll ring you. Good luck, darling. -I'll be fine. -Of course you will. -Are you all right? -Yes. It's a good idea to go through your statement before you're called in. Right. All parties in the case of Ruddock and Tinley. Apart from the victim herself, you will be hearing evidence from a witness who saw at first hand the abusive intimidation suffered by the victim on the train that night. Evidence which will further undermine any notion that what took place subsequently could be interpreted by any reasonable person as to constitute consensual sexual relations. They've, um... They've given me my statement to read, refresh my memory. This must be... For you, I mean. As they went through the trouble of catching them, it's the least I could do. Thank you for coming forward. You don't have to thank me. No. I'm so polite, it must be my training. Even the way I asked you for help that night, "Excuse me." I know. When you got off, that was so frightening, and just as humiliating as being... As that other thing. Look, I'm here to help you now. If they adjourn today, I'll come back tomorrow. And if they adjourn it tomorrow, I'll come back the day after. I know what I did. And I know what I'm trying to do now. Joseph Keyes. You see? Yeah. Mr Keyes. Now, obviously, your account of what happened on the train varies considerably from my clients'. They describe flirtatious, jocular, raucous exchanges between them and the young woman, fuelled mutually by their... merriness, from both parties having been out that night. As you have admitted yourself, you took part in those exchanges. I didn't take part when things became abusive and threatening. So, what did you do, Mr Keyes? I told them to lay off. According to your statement, you said, "Come on, fellas." Is that correct? Yes. So what does that mean, exactly? I meant stop it. Quite a mild censure, surely? Giving the impression that whatever you say you saw happening wasn't terribly serious. I took it seriously. Did you? You see, this is where my confusion about your actions begins. I wonder if you could help me with my confusion, if you don't mind. You have a responsible job and you support a family. You're one of the mainstays of the NHS, if you like. And I imagine you take your responsibilities as a member of the community, of society, seriously. Is that correct? Yes. You, more than most people perhaps... understand the contract that in a civilised society we are all bound to. The contract that demands... we help each other, look after each other. Would you disagree? No. I wouldn't expect you to. Hence my confusion this particular night, Mr Keyes, which is this... if there had been something you had seen which caused you real concern, you would have reported the matter immediately. I tried to. You approached the Help Point at the station? -I did. -Why? Because I had concerns, obviously. Why "obviously"? I saw a woman being threatened. So you pressed the emergency button, then? No. I spoke to someone, though. But if you saw a woman being threatened, surely that's an emergency. However, you pressed the information button and even discontinued that call, didn't you? I gave some information. Clearly not enough for staff to go on, clearly not enough for them to take action. I put it to you that your behaviour after getting off the train that night suggests a complete ambivalence in your own mind about what you thought was happening. And when push came to shove, you decided it was harmless. It wasn't harmless. We're back again to my confusion, unfortunately. On the basis of what you observed, there was nothing that prompted you to action for a further week or so, some days after you knew that a complaint of serious sexual assault had been made. Is that correct? Apart from the call I made to Crimestoppers. Apart from an anonymous phone call, yes. But your actual approach to the police, your giving a statement seems to me a somewhat retrospective reaction. Your interpretation of events changes when you hear a crime has been reported. What do you mean? Well, all of a sudden, you decide you knew exactly what you saw, exactly what you think took place. All of a sudden, you can provide a blow by blow account of a young woman being harassed, humiliated and virtually imprisoned on this train. I stand by my statement. I see. So why did you come forward so late in the day? Because, Mr Keyes, we can all understand your courage failing you physically if you allege you were threatened by Mr Ruddock and Mr Tinley. But then, over a week goes by in which you did nothing. And if what you're saying is true, this would be a situation from which you chose to walk away. Which, seeing the kind of man you are, the kind of job you do, I find very hard to believe. That night... I made a mistake. Well, that's not the only admission you'd be making, surely? You'd also be saying that a sexual assault was imminent and your response was less than should have been expected of you. An act of moral cowardice, ultimately. Moral turpitude, social treachery, call it what you will. And would you really be prepared to own up to that failing in open court, in front of all those present here now? Look, I'm not the one... Who did what, something reprehensible? I didn't! I'm absolutely sure you didn't, Mr Keyes. Otherwise, you'd have to publicly condemn yourself and your actions. Are you willing to do that? Or is there... a more acceptable explanation for your, uh, omission? That you really didn't know what was going on, you really couldn't tell. Because a man like you isn't, as in the story of the Good Samaritan, -a Pharisee. -Excuse me. Because a man like you doesn't walk away from people in trouble. It's unthinkable. Do you agree? It's unthinkable, yes. And you came here today because you wanted to do the right thing? Yes. Because you're an honourable man. Misguided but honourable. You're not demurring. No. Thank you. No more questions. Look, wait a minute. For Christ's sake! You may step down now, Mr Keyes. Over-educated bastard's trying to tie you up in knots and make a liar out of you. "You didn't see what you saw." "You'd been drinking so your judgement can't be relied upon." His clients were just fooling around. Blah, blah, blah. Look, you stuck to your guns. That's all that counts. Yeah, I stuck to my statement. Did they try and make anything of you not coming forward for a week after? Yeah, they tried. You've some unread messages there. -Yeah. -Who are they from? You can look at them if you want. I'm not hiding anything. It's all right, son. -What are you doing? -Deleting them. Why's your school uniform in the washing machine? He's deleting it. What? I just got it dirty, that's all. That's all. And when that passenger, Joseph Keyes, the witness whose evidence we have previously heard, when he left the train, can you tell the court what happened? Well, the one... I'd call him the main one, he offered me a cigarette. I said no and he said maybe I'd like one afterwards. Then he smiled and with that, his hand reached inside my skirt and he felt me. And what did you do? I pushed him away and he pushed me back. Really hard. And how did you react to that? I knew he'd have no hesitation about hurting me. That he would get violent? The push was violent enough. And after that? Please just take your time, miss. I know this is an ordeal. I've had worse. Look, Joe, the service engineer says he can't come and sort the other autoloader out till Thursday. What do you want us to do? I'll be back later, okay? I'm just going to court to see if they've reached a verdict. -Is it compulsory? -No, but I want to. Don't make a habit of this, will you? Members of the jury, have you reached verdicts in relation to John Ruddock and Wayne Tinley upon which you are all agreed? Yes. Please answer guilty or not guilty. Do you find the defendant John Ruddock guilty or not guilty of rape? Not guilty. Do you find the defendant Wayne Tinley guilty or not guilty of rape? Not guilty. Is that the verdict of you all or by a majority? Don't shout. What? Cos I'm doing it again. Go back to school, son. Well, what are you doing? Why aren't you at work? You won't tell anyone, will you? We never met, all right? Anyway, I'm really sorry about the verdict, Alice. Could you not take the rest of the day off? We're really busy. Okay. If you need to call, don't hesitate. It's over. I try to make it seamless, you know? Between the kitchen and the restaurant itself. It's all one machine working perfectly. Where's the builders? They had another job to go to. When are they coming back? Tomorrow, hopefully. Bastards. Just can't get the staff. -Why are you back already? -Me? Well, I made an executive decision to come home early, which is different to builders sodding off, of course. Ruddock and Tinley got off, didn't they? Did they? I made it my business to find out. I phoned the court. And I made it my business to be in the public gallery. Juries... How do they think, eh? Depends what they hear. Look, it might have been her evidence they didn't go for. What was yours, Joe? I mean, really. I never told any lies about what I saw. I never lied up there. I just wasn't gonna... Look, I wasn't the guilty one, was I? So, how did you... How did you feel when you left the witness box? -About what? -About you. Look, I would do anything for you and the kids, you know that. I'll always protect the people I love. That's all any of us can do, isn't it? How did you feel? Like I did when I got off the train. Like I abandoned her again. All you had to say... It's so easy, isn't it, Helen? Say what? Been honest! I didn't want to look weak. But if it helped her, who'd bloody give a shit, Joe? Look, those two guys might be walking around out now, but that is not my fault. I just wasn't a very good witness, that's all. That's all. It's rude to stare. Whatever you find yourself up against, I'd like to think that I've been there, too. What's that joke about a radiography department? Complete transparency. But I mean it. If you're not happy with the way your on-call rotas are being assigned or your relationship with casualty officers or any other department, you come to me. Because that's my responsibility. Because I'll look after you. But... But... But that's not to say that you can pass the buck every time. Because no-one likes someone who doesn't... who won't... who shirks. You know? Listen, I nearly never made it in today. I felt like shit. But I knew we had this meeting, and you needed to know where I'm coming from. Which I hope you do now. Okay. Are you all right? Not on the ball exactly, was I? First impressions, the man's not bloody up to it. Of course you are. I thought so, too. You said you felt like shit. Either that or your court appearance taking it out of you, eh? Oh, yeah, did I tell you? The bastards went down. Two years. -You did your bit, then? -Aye. Well done. Some satisfaction for that woman at least, eh? So, how are you taking to management? Oh, great. No-one's complained about their rota yet, so I must be doing something right. Get off of me! - Hey, get off! - What are you doing, Reece? - It's all right. - Pig! -Daddy's here now. Daddy's here. -I'm not six! What was going on? Dad, I'm not that upset. She was annoying me! She's annoyed you before, but you've never done that to her! You just call me next time, okay? Dad, let go. You're hurting me. Can you talk to him instead? Yeah, come on. Give me a good talking-to! Can't I do anything right? I'm not going to be the villain, you know. Hi. How are you doing? Thanks for agreeing to see me. The police advised me against it, actually, if I'm trying to move forward and all that. -What do they know? -Thank you. Late lunch? Customers get their lunch, two hours later, I get mine. -Were you busy? -Fully booked. A restaurant full of contented people rubs off sometimes. And gives you a bit to think about. Yeah, I've got a lot to think about. Look, I know you probably didn't have very high expectations of me, but I really meant to do better up there in the witness box... -It's besides the point. -What? You might not have been a very good witness, but I wasn't a very good victim, apparently. The jury took against me. I was too composed, too cool, too brittle, and I didn't struggle. I didn't do anything. I let it happen. And that all made me guilty, that made them not believe me. You know why I agreed to see you, don't you? Because you're the only one who knows differently, you're the only one who has any idea of what I went through. Ruddock and Tinley know. But I didn't ask them for help, did I? You knew I needed it, didn't you? Yes. I needed your help. You needed my help. That's what I wanted to hear you say. I couldn't say it in court. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. -I'd better order. -Um, please... Some people can rise to the occasion, not you, obviously. No, that's where you're wrong. That's about as forgiving as I can get. At the moment, eh? At the moment. Look, you've said what I wanted to hear, okay? Anyway, I'm not hungry. This doesn't have to be it. Your husband's taking something of a back seat, is he? He's just caught up with work and stuff. Reece says he's got no complaints. And given that last time he showed a willingness to let the cat out of the bag, so to speak... But the way he's been behaving at home... Well, dare I say it, that's maybe where the problems are now. I just want him to be all right, and I know he's not. Well, like I say... I really think how you find out is up to you and your husband now. What exactly are we looking for? Something to go on. I don't know. Paracetamol? -You think so? -No. Typical of the school to lay it all at our door, though. Yeah. Well? It's got nothing to do with you. You shouldn't have been looking, anyway. You want protection, you come to us. Helen, let me deal with this. -Where did you get it? -Helen, leave us. -He's losing it. -Out! -What were you thinking of? -Done enough thinking. This can only ever bring you more trouble. How would you know? -I'm your bloody father. -So? I'm getting rid of this, for a start. -I need it. -Not when we're around. You was around that woman on the train! Can I just have my knife back, please? It bigs me up, it just makes me feel safe. That's the worst thing, isn't it, Dad? People thinking you're weak. So give me that back and they won't. There's no way I can let you have this. Well, you ain't got nothing else I can have. This flu bug's taken quite a few of the permanent staff out. We're gonna be stretched on the on-calls. I'll come in and cover. You? You're supposed to have put that behind you. Volunteer here, I said. -It's not what you do any more, Joe. -I don't care. I want to cover. Family'll love you. Yeah. I don't get this. Someone in your post doesn't do on-calls. That was half the idea of your promotion. I've got to lead by example, okay? So when are you coming back? I'll be sleeping at the hospital for the next few days, that's all. -I feel sorry for you. -No-one's making him, Louise. Well, I don't have a lot of choice. -Really? -You don't mind, do you? Who am I to interfere? See you soon. Bye-bye, darling. Is it for the overtime, so you can afford the extension? Got it in one. Right, then. Going off to fight the good fight, are you? What's that supposed to mean? Offering yourself up for on-calls you don't have to do? I won't be doing them forever. But for now, you need a place to hide, do you? It'll bring in extra money. I don't give a shit about the money! I need you at home. Reece needs you! You said you would always protect your family. But I'm not bloody welcome here, Helen, not by you, not by him. I go where I'm wanted, you know? And walking away solves that problem, does it? Well, it makes it easier, yeah. You're a fucking coward, Joe! See? I told you you didn't want me. I didn't want a Superman, I just wanted a good one, and I thought I had one. You want the whole bloody works, Helen. You want me to be everything! Well, right now, all you are is a radiographer. Well, at least that's something, eh? Mum, come in now. This is Reece. You're not lucky enough to be speaking to me in person. So leave me a message and I might even ring you back. Reece, it's me. No panic. I just wondered where you were and what you wanted to do about your tea. Give me a ring. I'm on me mobile because... Because I've just popped out to the shops. Bye. If there's no panic, why are we driving around looking for him? Because I don't just want to be sat by the phone. I want to be doing something. Anyway, he's a big boy now. Boys are never big, Louise. -I'll probably see you later, yeah? -See you. Bloody idiot! - Hello? - Yeah. Mum, yeah, it's me. -Reece, where have you been? -Yeah, I'm coming home soon. Joe, how many hours have you been on for? Don't know. Who cares? Busy, busy, busy. One of the casualty officers has come back. You put the wrong date of birth in for two patients. -And as everybody's filed by date of birth... -Oh, shit. What's going on? First, you couldn't get your head around your new responsibilities, and now, you're trying to bury yourself in when you don't need to. I said I'd cover, and I am. What are you trying to prove, Joe? That I can. Joe? No, me. Sorry. What's wrong? Why does there have to be something wrong? Well, is there? You want to get in? No. All right, then. Just for a bit. Just for a bit. I nearly did something tonight. "Nearly"? I couldn't go through with it. I'm too much of a pussy. Okay. I just wanted to show Dad, you know? I just wanted to show him. I heard they're adapting Navy sonar equipment to get the transducers to take better images of obese patients. Too much fat between the skin and the organs. So bloody wide you can't see a thing. Excuse us just a sec, Andrew, will you? Sure. -Did you just send that patient to X-ray? -Yes. What's happening, man? It's only Wednesday. What? We usually get you lot on Friday nights. Very lairy up in A&E, but much more obedient by the time you get down here. Anyway, I've got all your details. I know where you live. If you don't piss off, I'm gonna start shouting. I saw you up in A&E. Could have avoided you, pretended you had nothing to do with me. I'm not! The two worst moments of my life and you were there for both of them. Look, just take the X-ray, all right? It hurts! You know, I'm trying to do more than my fair share here, but if I take your scan, if I help the casualty officer help you, what good am I doing, eh? What good am I doing? I want to be seen by someone else, all right? -Calm down, mate. -He's just refused to treat me! -Why would he do that? -I haven't. -Because we've got a history! -Look, this is silly. Look, do you want us to call security? Matt, I thought you were in there, anyway. I was. Joe said he'd take over. He tried to give evidence against me. No-one believed him. Why should you believe him now? Look, maybe I'd better just leave you to this, yeah? You were unreliable on the train and you were unreliable in court! I thought you said those guys went down? See what I mean? Hi. Take a seat. -I'll be with you in a minute. -Okay. How're you doing? What do you want? The other day, I didn't want that to be it. What about what I want? Every time you go out, you must think... Have you been waiting for me? I wanted... It's not a proposition, cos that sounds... It's something I wanted to do for you. You've done enough. No, listen to me. I'm sorry. But, those guys, they are still walking around, free as anything, and you're not, right? And the police liaison or whatever has long gone and the Victim Support thing has done its job and even if you've got friends and family, they weren't there. You know? And I just want to be available to you. "Available"? Any time you want to talk or... You know, if you think you hear noises outside your flat or someone looks at you for a second too long, I could... I could be there. What are you talking about, my own personal Samaritan? Do you think about them all the time? A lot more than I want to. Well, you wouldn't have to. If I could just get the chance to show you... Why do you think that's your job? Because I'm responsible. I've got to live with it, all right? So have you. I can't. Excuse me, I'm looking for a guy called Ruddock, John Ruddock. Do you know him? I've got an address here for a Wayne Tinley, a mate of his. He lives round here. I was just wondering if Ruddock did the same. I'm not the police. Well, the police wouldn't come here if they wanted to get me. Yeah, well, I am on my own. Excuse me, I'm looking for a guy called John Ruddock who lives near here. Excuse me, I'm looking for a guy called John Ruddock who lives near here. Medium height, stocky build, brown hair. Ooh, he sounds nice! What're you doing, man? I'm looking for someone. What sort of someone are you looking for? I don't get you. I see you doing chat, I'm thinking, "Who's this?" You're in my place, do you get me? -Oh, yeah. Sorry, yeah, okay. -So come for a walk with me or you get out of my way, you move. This person I'm looking... "Person"? You're looking for a person? Yeah, his name's John Ruddock. Seen him. I've seen him. -You know him? -White, isn't it? -That's right. -No, I don't know him. -Apparently, he lives close by. -What's he like? -Description? -No, man, no. He's an animal, but you wouldn't know it. Yeah, yeah. British Queen, then, or The Rose. Done out nice, but a lot of nastiness inside. You know what I'm saying? Thank you. I just might have killed you. Yes, mate? I'm looking for... a pint of lager. Another one, mate? Why not? Why not? Looks like my date's not going to show. Been stood up, have you? Dumped by everyone, me. All right, mate. Have you heard about this thing in the States called Broken Windows? I don't know all the ins and outs of it, but the gist of it is, that you've got an empty building in a town, right? -No need to shout, mate. -No, but it's important. Anyways, someone throws a stone through one of the windows of an empty building, but no-one does anything. No-one does a thing, okay? No attempt to repair it, nothing. I hope this story's got a punch line, fella. They don't catch the stone thrower, either. And then, one by one, slowly but surely, all the other windows in all the other empty buildings start to get smashed, and then, the buildings that aren't empty, and then, the windows of the houses that the people live in. All of them smashed with stones or anything else that comes to hand, and it's not just one culprit any more. Shut him up, Budgie, will ya? I'm gonna have to sling you out in a minute, mate. Yeah, I'm not finished yet. Soon, there's a whole bunch of them out there on the rampage. And pretty soon the whole town's vandalised, and the whole community's in shreds, under siege. One thing leads to another, you know? Everything goes to pieces because of one broken window. I'm sorry about your date and all that, mate, but we've just about had enough, all right? I'm his date. -What? -Ain't that right? You've got to act, stop the rot as soon as it starts, or we're finished. I think you're out of the game, too, my son. -So come on. -Not yet. So, what do we do, eh? What do we all do, eh? So what are you going to do? Everybody wants to know what I'm going to do. So I came all the way down here, all the way down, man, you have no idea, because I wanted to... I wanted to make amends, that's all! You, come on, out. Out! Couldn't carry it off, eh? As usual. That's it, you monk! Run away! You're still scared! You didn't try to stop me. You just let me carry on. Joseph Keyes? Yes. Joseph Keyes, I am arresting you on suspicion of assaulting a man named John Ruddock on the 15th of October, 2003, at the Whitewater estate. I must caution you that you do not have to say anything, but that it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. We need to interview you now. I was doing another job. I'm sorry. You have the right to have someone informed of your arrest, the right to legal representation, and if you want to see a solicitor, you'll have to sign here. In the meantime, you'll be put in a cell till the officer's ready to interview you. New to all this? New to all this. This way. Well, obviously, I was disappointed with the verdict. Outraged, really. I was frustrated that my evidence didn't seem to have any weight with the jury. And then, this poor bloody woman has to go through all that. And it's no wonder that women don't report what happens to them because the criminal justice system is just so... So you thought you'd uphold the law of the day? I wasn't really interested in the law. It was personal, then? The jury was still out on me. Interview suspended at 16:02. Do you want some coffee? -Can we have a word outside? -Sure. So far, you haven't actually admitted that you carried out this assault. My advice to you now is don't. Why? How do I manage that? Ruddock's already made a complaint. What did they just say to you? I'll be appearing in a few weeks. I'll be pleading not guilty. But wouldn't it be better for you if you admitted you did it? Because, I mean, there's all sorts of mitigating factors, aren't there? You're a family man, you've got a responsible job, you can show remorse. They'll know how cooperative you've been. Good character. If you plead not guilty, they'll punish you even more. If I plead guilty, I'll still go to jail. Look, Helen, I'm just taking advice and I might change my plea, but not yet, okay.? If they sentence you... you'd lose your job, wouldn't you? They wouldn't take you back, not for something like this. But then, prison's a really good way of getting away from it all, isn't it? Did I send you to Ruddock? Was it me? No, it wasn't you. How are the kids? Write to them. You know their address. How did we get like this? I'm sorry. Check the tomato juice. A customer has complained that it's off. I think she might be right. Excuse me. I'm sorry to trouble you, but... Your drink's off, too? My husband's name is Joseph Keyes. Christ Almighty. I thought you might say something like that. He's attacked Ruddock. He's been charged with it. I saw you giving your evidence. Why? Had to know what happened to you. If I'm honest, I wanted to know what you were going to say about Joe. Not much to say. Would you mind telling me? He looked the other way. What can I say? What do you think of him? -Look, I'm busy. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry about everything. It's just that we've fallen apart, and it started with that night, it started with what you saw in him. He's not a bad person, okay? He's just not a terribly good one. Decent enough. He's been to see me a few times, all solicitous, seeking forgiveness. But just ordinary, you know? Nothing special. Sorry if that sounds cruel. I just want him to be special to me, that's all. You're doing great. -How the bloody hell would you know? -No... Anyway, I realise you have to save yourself. No-one else will. I don't want to be that alone. Neither did I. The way you want him... I'm going to feel like that one day. Dad? Dad, what have you been doing? Hello, son. What's going on? What's going on? Well, I can't go home and I can't be at work, so... No man's land, eh? Do you know how cold it is in no man's land? You need something to keep you warm. Oh. Where have you been? Playing football against another school. Mum's picking me up from here. -You're in the team? -Other kids picked me. It's been going around, what you've been charged with. Little thing in the local paper and just gossip, really. "Reece's dad is a psycho"? Sort of rubbed off on me, anyway. They thought they'd better pick me. That's lucky. Yeah. Why'd you do it, Dad? Cos he thought I couldn't. You showed him anyway. There's better ways, son. You might have to be the man of the house for a while, you know. I want you to be. Eh? I want you to be the man of the house. I don't like it when you're not there. That was the worst thing I ever did, not being there, copping out on you, son. Cos you're my life. And if I end up in prison, what can I be to you there? What are we going to do, Reece? -What are we going to do, son? -Don't do that. -I can't help it. -Yes, you can! It's okay to shout "help," you know. It's okay to shake in your boots and want someone to make it better. I know. Do you? Mum's been really nice to me this week. Cuddled me and that. Lucky. She even let me get in with her. Ah, well, that's what really takes some doing, you know. Knowing... Knowing what to do when somebody needs you. And I've messed up on that, son. I've got it all wrong. That's what makes me a weakling. Feels like a while since I've been here. Yeah. Ruddock's retracted his statement. That's... -That's... -Lucky? We had a word. Why are you doing this for me? We spoke to our British Transport colleagues. The bastard had it coming to him anyway, didn't he? What goes around comes around. What sort of word did you have? We appealed to his pride, to his ego. Didn't take much selling. The bottom line is, he didn't want to be thought of as a victim. If it comes out in court that he was badly hurt by a mild-mannered radiographer, well... the shame. Anyway, he thinks he's got a reputation, some standing within the local community. So I'm not going to be prosecuted? No evidence. It's not in the public interest. Thank you, for, um, you know, intervening. I really did hurt him, you know. Some things are in the public interest. What did he say? It's over. Ruddock's withdrawn his complaint. They're not gonna prosecute. Why did he withdraw it? It's a bit of a conspiracy, really. Rules of the club. So, is everything else over? That's up to you. Homework, hormones, I'm ready for anything. Going to make it your business? You're my business. You better help me in with these, then. -What have you got me? -Just your dinner. No, I said to you, is it all right if she comes round? -It's my flat. -What's that got to do with anything? All I'm saying is, I asked you and you said... Look, I don't remember, all right? Anyway, I can't stand her. And what do you mean, "it's your flat"? I pay towards it. Your name isn't on the bit of paper, is it? -Does that matter? -Matters to me. -Look, just piss off, all right? -Stupid bitch! -Go on, then! -Hey! This is private.
