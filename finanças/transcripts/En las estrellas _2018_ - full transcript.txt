Ingmar! Ingmar! -Where were you? -What are you doing in there? A guard came and I hid, but the actor's gone. -What? -He's gone. -Where to? -Who knows? He's not coming back. Just what I needed. That guy's a dickhead. He said he can't stand you. I think because you yell. If he weren't such a dickhead, I wouldn't yell at him. -What do we do now? -Keep filming. Come on, get out of there. I found a brilliant location. Here, take this. But, Víctor, we don't have any actors now. Never mind, we'll film me from behind. You don't even have the same jacket! If the audience notices that stuff, they have no interest in the movie. If you keep saying that, they'll never be interested. -Then fuck the audience. -Then why are we making movies? Víctor, I'm talking to you! To do what pleases us. Son, I'll tell you something: audentes fortuna iuvat. "Fortune favors the brave". Seneca said that. You said it was Virgil. But Seneca said it too later. Give me the camera and stand there, over there. Stay still, I'm going to get you in focus. Okay? -Víctor! -Hold on, -I'm setting up the camera. -Víctor! Will you hold still? Don't move till I say. -What if the guards come? -If they do, tell me. -Víctor! -What do you want now?! The guards are coming. Shit! -But we didn't get the shot! -We will when they go. Come on! Give me the camera, you'll drop it. Hurry! Hurry! Hold it! Hey there! Hold it! Run! Stop! Stop, you jerk! -You said you were giving it up. -I said: when we finish the movie. -That's not true. -It isn't? -Have I ever lied to you? -Every day. -What the hell are you doing?! -It'll be better in the trunk. -You're a drag, son. -And you're a grotty old fart. And now we don't have a camera. Don't worry about the camera, it was on its last legs. -How will you finish the movie? -I'm not going to. -Why is that? -Look, son, the actor wanted out and the film wasn't looking good, not how I'd like it. It's better to start another one. You always say that and then you never finish. Hey! I finished "Posidonius and the Barbarians". Nobody saw it. -You saw it. -Yes, but it was silent. So what if it was silent? Nobody wants to see silent movies, much less about Romans. -They were Greeks. -I don't care. -Nobody likes your movie. -Your mother liked it. -She never saw it. -She would've liked it. -You said she hated movies. -You don't even remember her. Now what? I think the engine's overheated. If we wait a while, it'll start again. This is a tough car, not like the ones today. -You know who gave me this car? -The Americans... The Americans. It was one of our first shoots... and this was a prop car, just fantastic. Víctor, it's a heap. Why don't you get rid of it? It'll last for a few more shoots, at least until the next movie. When will you make a movie that's not cruddy? Got anything else to bug me with? Yes. I'm hungry. A small soda and two discount burgers. -You don't have a bill? -Keep the change. I don't get why people buy all this food then leave it. Because people are assholes, son. Maxima egestas avaritia. "Greed is the greatest poverty". You shouldn't have taken the nuggets off that table. Why? There are no bite marks. Look at that guy. I think he's looking for them. Nah, he's looking for his smokes. -Do you want to see a movie? -Which one? Can I choose? Sure. Today we're going to see a great movie. "HEFTY REASONS" "WHAT A BANANA" "SUCKY-SUCKY" "LOCKED ROOM" These are shit. My choice today, eh? -Hello, Laura. -Hello. Anyone in cinema 2? It's empty, as usual. What's up with the sign? Have you switched to porn? Almost. Dad thought more people would come this way, but not with these movies. -Want to go to storage? -Yes! We should get rid of all this. My dad thinks they're still worth something, but nobody wants them, not even the Film Library. What are you going to do? You can't throw them out. If only. Look, look, look... Werner Schroeter, this really is a treasure. You can keep it. I found a cool one. Look, son, here you've got Murnau, Renoir, Bresson, Mizoguchi... Tell me the truth... Do you want to see Schroeter? -I want this one! -But that's crap! Yours is crap! I want to see this one! -Where are you going? -To talk to Morris. Stay here. You're going to drink, right? Of course not. Who do you take me for? Don't end up lying in a puddle. You hear me? Did you hear me, Víctor? So you're not going to finish this one either? The actor's resigned and the camera's in bits. That's it, it's all over. Incredible. You have an amazing theater to premiere it and you're incapable of finishing a movie. In 8 years! Who cares? Why finish them? No one'll come see them. Yes, people don't come to the movies, it's the crisis. No, Morris, it's not the crisis. Not for me. -I blew it. -No, it wasn't so bad. But a silent movie about Romans in this century? I'm surprised you didn't film it in Latin. They were Greek. It wasn't the movie. You have to throw away that photo and forget that woman. Look on the bright side. You know what I'd do to be single? You complain, and I work for free! One day I'll throw all those cans in the trash. Do it then, just leave me alone. But don't forget, I'm a lawyer. You, a lawyer? You'd lose your own mind. I only lost once in the courthouse, the day I married you. -You're a bum! -And you're useless! Mediocre, a failure! -Dull as dishwater! -Leave me alone! Hey, Víctor. -My vodka. -I'll pay you later. I'm going to the car for some peace and quiet. Hey... Hey, wait! Don't take it away. The car park's right there, sir. Can't you see it? Sure. I just left it for a moment, I swear. He leaves it there every night. Always in the same spot. Who asked you? -Ignore him, he's drunk. -You can't park here! Got it? "Filthy", this is my home. -You know that, "Filthy"? -Your home? You don't have a home. And you don't have a car! Hey! Don't take it away! Please! Ángela. Víctor. -What are you doing here? -Aren't you glad to see me? You don't know how much I missed you. Where have you been all these years? That doesn't matter. Everything's alright now. No, it's not alright. You weren't alright. Why were you always so sad? -What are you talking about? -That you... Well, I thought... you were dead. One day I'll get it right. I swear I'll get it right. Then you'll forgive me. You'll forgive me... because... I'll get things right. I told you not to end up in a puddle. How was the movie? Better than your movies. You know what? I've been thinking. I just thought of a new movie. -Another one? -No, not just another one. This time it'll be a commercial movie. What's it about? Really, this movie's going to be... incredible! It's a new idea, unlike anything else. And it's going to work. It will because nobody's done anything like it... ever! -But will there be Romans? -No Romans. -Or Greeks? -No Greeks. -Is it science fiction? -Totally. -Then there has to be monsters. -Sure there'll be monsters. And giant robots. There have to be robots. Yes, as well. But how can you film that? You've got no money. With special effects like I used to do. No computers and all that modern shit. We're going to make a movie with real effects, with models, paintings... Okay, but what's it about? Look, it's the story of a guy. A guy... who makes up... ideas. A liar like you? No, a writer. He was sick of being bothered. He couldn't concentrate, they wouldn't leave him alone. So he left to write in a solitary place, among the stars. AMONG THE STARS A film by Víctor Martín On the Moon, no one would bother him. He wrote for days, weeks, months. He was an intelligent man, sensitive, cultured, elegant, a good-looking guy. In fact, without being conceited, he was a lot like me. Hold on. How did he get to the Moon? He built... a space ship. Come on! People don't keep spaceships at home. -What did he make it with? -With... a fridge. -How does a fridge fly? -He put wings on it. So... it'd be a flying robot. Sure, that's it, a flying robot. And what happened? One day the guy stopped writing. He couldn't go on. He realized that what he needed was someone to read what he was writing. See? You always need an audience. Yes, but be quiet a moment. So, he tried reading his stories to his robot. But, well, he wasn't very expressive. He said to it: "Go find someone to listen to my stories. And not a robot". The writer waited for days, weeks, months. He couldn't write, he couldn't sleep... Until at last... his robot returned. The writer told all his stories to the woman and she fell in love with him. -But he'd kidnapped her. -Not at all. They were happy... and they had a son. That script is stupid. The Moon has no edges, you can't fall off a cliff. It's a movie. In the movies there are cliffs on the Moon. I don't care, it's dumb. Did you like it? Nobody does, it's shit. It is not! It's a movie my dad's going to direct. But your dad's a drunk. At least he doesn't smell as bad as you. You are kind of stinky. You're a son of a bitch! Wait, wait... Your son's behavior is violent enough -to start an expulsion file. -He just insulted him. He called him a "son of a bitch". That kid is a son of a bitch. He called us "stinky". -It's only natural. -Maybe natural to you, but here a lack of respect is not natural, nor is it natural that your son skips class when he wants without a note. I shall have to take measures. Excuse me. -Aren't you driving me today? -I took it to the garage. You'll see, it'll be like new. Look, Víctor, they're filming! Come on! Come on. Rolling! Look, that guy can't even hold a camera. This bunch of snobs have no fucking idea. Would we have a camera like this for the movie? Sure. When I finish the script, we'll do a much better shoot. How about those effects! Have you seen them? What's that? -A letter from the bank. -What does it say? Uh... Merry Christmas. Alicia? I don't care if you don't want to talk to me. I need Dad's money. I have an eviction order and... Hello? "With the new Ultraspira, my time is worth so much more". -Cut! Now what's wrong? -It doesn't work! It's shit! Fix it, for God's sake! -Víctor, what are you doing here? -I see you're doing great without me. Come here a moment. I thought you call me to shoot this crap. Sure, so you can insult my clients again. Insult? They're professional frauds, everything they sell breaks down. You left marks up there! The eraser doesn't work. Can we pull the roll up? Do you know much it costs? And be careful, it's our last eraser! Armando, I need to get paid. When are you paying me? I can't right now, wait a little longer. Even longer? If I charged you back interest, I'd be rich. You wasted 6 months on a documentary meant to take a week. And it looked good, right? -What?! -The vacuum cleaner's dead. -Use another, no one will notice. -Do I go to the store? -Don't you have one? -My mother does. Then go to her place. Go! Go! -Interns, honestly...! -I can't keep waiting, Armando. I can't pay you, but I have a job. A series. A family comedy for average folks: housewives, kids, grandmas, dogs... If we do it well and sell it, we'll make a killing. -I have 2000 euros for the pilot. -Will you pay me already? When it's delivered, but it has to be brilliant. Can you still write something like that? Find someone else. This is a fine time. -Is my son in here? -Yes, but you have to wait. -Stay here a moment, please. -Yes. Thanks. Where were you? They wouldn't let me out. I was in a meeting. Important stuff. Right, let's go. Mr. Martín. Weren't you told to wait? Hello. No, they didn't say anything to me. -Can I have a word? -Yes, of course. -I'm listening. -You keep arriving late and neglecting the attendance of your son at school. I was in an important meeting with some producers... If you want, I can apologize, but explaining to you won't do much good. You're right, you'd better explain to Social Services. Before you call them, I'd like to ask you... Don't ask me anything, they've already been advised. -Were you really with some producers? -Sure. Did you talk about your movie? They liked the idea. When I finish the script, they'll make me a great offer. When will you finish it? I'm on it. Where did I get to? The girl fell to Earth. Yes... that was it: she fell. So the writer sent his robot to look for her again. But the robot... never came back. They had to go look for her. Luckily, they found a stray satellite... and they caught it. He used its solar panels, putting them... on a washing machine. Before leaving, the writer promised his son that he'd bring back his mother. But his son wanted to go. But it could be dangerous. Yes, but his son didn't care. But both of them didn't fit in the washing machine. You're a cheat. He covered deserts, forest, cities, glaciers and swamps, but he couldn't find her, until he found himself in a storm. And a monstrous fish swallowed him. But it seems the device didn't taste too good. Good morning. Are you Víctor? Nice to meet you. I'm Rita, the social worker. May I come in? Look, Ingmar, this is... -a woman here to see us. -Hi, I'm Rita. -Nice to meet you. What's your name? -Ingmar. What? Ismael? Ingmar. As in Ingmar Bergman, the director. -What are you reading? -A girls comic. Comics aren't for girls or for boys, as long as you like them. Can I see? This isn't a com... This isn't for children. -It's a girls comic. -Where'd you get this? It's indecent, you're too young. How many times must I tell you? You gave it to me. -What are you doing? -Don't pretend now! -Please, don't hit your son. -Fucking hell, I didn't hit him. -You asshole. -Don't fucking swear! -Listen,... -I told him. ...son, where's your mother? She drowned in the bathtub. That's why my father doesn't like showers. He's kidding, I shower every day. We'll expect you on Tuesday. You'll need to bring your paycheck. My hours are irregular, I don't know if I can. I'll call you. Look... I'm here to help you, but I need you to cooperate. Do you realize that? Why is that lady saying she wants to help you? Because... she's a producer. She wants to invest in the movie, so we have to do everything she says, okay? -Come on, don't jerk me around. -But it's true. She's rich, very rich. Posh people are like that. -How much does she want to invest? -A lot. A hell of a lot. -How much? -At least 20,000 euros. 20,000 euros? Can we make the movie with that? Well, we can start with that. So from now on we have to keep it all clean in case she comes. And in front of her, you'll do everything I say, okay? Okay. I know you're not having a great time, but neither am I. Do you know what it costs to keep all this going? And the rent, it's really steep. And you have to appreciate the risk I'm running. Look at this new camera. You know what it cost? 10,000 euros, almost 10,000 euros. Are you telling me you have money to buy cameras, but not to pay me? 10 years I've been in that flat, they can't throw me out. They can, they're banks. You're fucked. I'm telling you, I'm a lawyer. That's pretty damn obvious. What a shitty lawyer. -Do you want me to lie to him? -You can't even do that right. You're just fucking with me. You wish. If you want to fuck, you'll have to start paying. You want to charge for that too? I'm picking up those cans and cleaning the storeroom. What are you doing here? Aren't you getting out of the bath? Why don't you come out? Why don't you get me out? Víctor, the producer's here. Who? The posh lady who was going to invest 20,000 euros. Do you know my father can film on a shoestring? I'm sure, son. I don't doubt it. Do you like robot movies? -Not much, actually. -And monsters? -Not those either. -So what movies do you like? About real people with real problems. Here, my bank statement. See? I have almost 10,000 euros in the bank. It's current, the date was at the top. I think it tore or... The date's on the back. -It's from four years ago. -Really? So that's what Mega Kong looked like? Sure, he was like a robot. This was before special effects. Right, let's go. Want one for Christmas, for your collection? We're broke and you want to buy more toys? -They're for you, damn it. -Why do you play with them? Look, Ingmar, the main thing in life... is movies. But other things are important, like toys, because they make you happier and a better person. If your mother was still with us, she'd have loved for us to buy that robot. Forget her, Víctor. You have to find a job. HAPPY 2008 So you're not the real Santa? Sure I am, the others are frauds. I'm the good one. Why do you smell like alcohol? Look, girl, sometimes I need a drink -to stand the cold of the North Pole. -The North Pole? But Santa lives in Lapland. Yeah, well, in Lapland, the North Pole... I set up some franchises. What's a franchise? How do I explain this...? Franchises are branches of a business. -And this is a business. -But they're presents. Yes, but everything has to be paid for, you know? Really? Who pays for them? That girl asked too many questions. Fuck, this is so simple! You just say: "Have you been good? What do you want for Christmas?" -Anyone can do that. -You are "anyone". I pay you to be just anyone, don't you get it? What are you doing? Ingmar, son, I'm in a meeting. I can't talk now. Do you mind turning off your phone while you're working? Christ! Where are you going? You're out on the street, you hear me? You're fired! You're fired! Shit! Ingmar! -Ingmar! -I'm coming! "I'm coming"? Ingmar! What are you doing? The frying pan caught fire. Pouring water on it didn't work. Leave that stuff! Let's go! But you said they were important! Give me that! Here, grab the sack! Grab it! Come on, come on. It's hot, eh? Why are you dressed like that? I was... at a fancy-dress party with the producers of our movie. Have you finished the script? Almost. Where was I? Oh, yes. The writer kept looking for his wife, which took him to... the top of the highest, most remote mountain. He'd never seen anything like it. The door looked too heavy to move. Would his wife be inside? How could he open it? He was thinking it over when... The door was just a set decoration. And not just the door, everything inside was. He'd found the set decorations of all the forgotten films in the world. They were kept there, all of them. As he walked on, he encountered obstacles and trompe l'oeil. "Trompe l'oeil"? What's that? A trick of the eye, nothing the writer couldn't work out. Who'd stored all those marvels in that place? In the middle of that city he found a temple. In the middle of the temple he found a hall full of robots. And in the middle of the hall, an enormous diary. It was in robot language. Naturally, the writer had no trouble reading it. A long time ago all those robots and set decorations from old movies were owned by an old producer. When he died, the banks seized his assets and decided to get rid of it all in a huge bonfire, not just the robots but the set decorations too. But one night the robots escaped the fire, took away everything they could and hid in the mountains, in a place where the banks couldn't find them... ever. Their lost city would be guarded by the biggest robot of all, an enormous guardian. Guardian? What guardian? Víctor Martín? Are you the boy's father? Yes. Why was the boy at home alone? You're going to jail me for going to work? -No, you'll just spend the night here. -Where's my son? He'll still go to school, but he'll sleep in the shelter until the closest relative takes him. Your sister... Alicia. Is that possible? Half-sister. She couldn't look after a dog. Listen, I just need a little time to sort things out. Listen, Alicia, I need my share of the money. I didn't ask you to look after my son! DO NOT ENTER - POLICE SHELTER FOR MINORS "LITTLE ANGELS" - FALLEN Hey, butthead, why are you in here? I burnt my house down. Hey, Anita, "Brains", come here! This guy burnt his house down. Check it out, "Brains". -No way! -You've got some balls. With your parents inside? No, the house was enough. You should stop drinking. You're telling me that, you lush? Let go of that. I'd rather pour it down the toilet than let you drink it. Víctor, you have to get a job. Clean up, take a shower. You want me to lend you a suit and tie? Can you believe it? All her life whining about my cans, and now she cries. -What'll they do with them? -I'd rather not know. Here, it's all I got. -Thanks, Morris. I'll give it back. -Don't make me laugh. Are you sure of what you're doing? Elías, get it right, you've all had such a morning... Return the ball, Aitana. Come on. Be careful, kids. If you shoot too hard, you will... He's so handsome. Hey, I'm over here. Ingmar! -What are you doing here? -I came to get you. -They said I can't go with you. -Yes, but we're going. -Where to? -To shoot the film. -But the guard at the gate? -You're sick and your dad's here. -They won't buy it. -Look sick. -It's just... -C'mon, let's go. Where are you going? Not that way! To the gate! Ingmar! Ingmar, Ingmar! Come on. Raúl, throw it. Ingmar! What are you doing? Come on, guys! Come on. Do you want to shoot? Come on, go for it. But, Ingmar, we're in class! -I'll kill you! -Son of a bitch! Ingmar, come here! Ingmar! -Where are you going? -Hold him, he wants to hit me! I'm going to whip your ass! Hold it! -What are we going to do? -I told you, -shoot the film. -What with, a mobile phone? Look in back. -Where'd you get that? -The posh lady invested. -Didn't I tell you? -Great, we're shooting it! Up top! -All this food. -Sure, now we've got money. -Have you finished the script? -I'm on it. Where was I? He was eaten by a giant robot. What now? Just before he fell into the robot's stomach, the writer grabbed the uvula in its gigantic throat. From there he found a way to escape. He slid down some pipes... until he landed in a dark room. It looked like a control room. It wasn't so hard to drive the metal giant. So he decided to use it to keep looking for his wife. He covered swamps, glaciers, cities, forests and deserts. Until they reached the end of the road. They couldn't go on. It was... the end of the Earth itself. Why did they go there? He must've been following some clue, right? Yes, exactly. At the edge of the precipice... was his wife's nightdress. He had no choice, he had to jump. Again? Do they have to jump off every precipice they come to? It's symbolic language, you can't use conventional logic. If only you'd use it sometimes... Don't worry. This way's better, it's a shortcut. A shortcut to where? To say hi to your aunt Alicia. With the money she owes me, we'll finish the whole movie. Víctor, she won't give you the money. She hates you. What do you mean? She loves me madly. Merry Christmas. -You look like a beggar. -But I'm wearing a suit. A beggar in a suit. -I put it on to see you. -To come begging, you mean. Nice to see you too. -Son, say hi to Aunt Alicia. -Hi, Aunt Alicia. Hello, Ingmar. My, you've grown, you look more and more like your father. I feel sorry for you. She's acting tough. Deep down, she adores me. But really deep down, right? What are you doing? You've got your father's manners. Come on, let's go out for a smoke. I don't care if he's your son, you can't abduct him. Lower your voice! They abducted him, I rescued him! Have you gone completely mad? You can't run off with a child. -You've seen too many movies. -He can go to school in another country. Really? He'd be better off here. Besides, they offered me custody. -He doesn't want to live with you. -You're no good as a father, he'd just have problems with you. Now you all want to take him away! -Money can fix my only problem. -I don't have any. -And the inheritance? -I spent it. -On what? -Recovering this house, you idiot! It was seized because of your fucking movie. But...? No, hold on. No, you said it was sorted out. What did you want me to say? You had enough problems already. I've been paying the bank for 8 years and it's still theirs. Mind if I have a shower in my old house? What are you looking at? Come here. Why do you hate him? I don't hate him. Your father... is a drunk and he's crazy, but he's a good guy. -And he was good at his job. -He really was good? Come here. See? This one here. Your father on his first shoot. He spoke English, he was smart, he had great ideas. That's why the Americans called him. He did special effects, on major projects, but the thing with your mother finished him off. Yes, I know. She fell asleep in the bath. Is that what your father told you? Víctor always says that it's his fault for leaving her alone. People don't fall asleep in the bath. Don't believe your father's stories. Honey, do you want to live with me? You'd be fine here, you wouldn't want for anything. I have money. Why do you want so much money if you're so old? You're... just as rude as your father. What's he doing up there? Víctor! Will you get out of there? Víctor! Where are we going? To find the set for our movie. -In the middle of nowhere? -In the middle of nowhere. There it is. Cool! It can't have been that long. It was all in good condition. This place is so cool! Do you know who built this? My American friends. Those houses... There was a Wild West set. Look, there's the giant fish. And the castle. Where's the rocket? They turned this into a theme park, but it must've failed. There's your Mega Kong. Okay, rolling... Action! The giant hand's coming for you. Crouch down and look scared. Cut! Not like that. -Why not like this? -You're overacting, I don't believe it. A giant gorilla's attacking me. Is that believable? -It won't be with bad acting. -How do you want me to do it? -Do it real. -I am doing it real! Would you scream like that? Imagine a boulder falling on you. Okay, smart-ass, you'll see. Start filming. -Hey, Víctor. -What do you want now? It won't turn on. It won't turn on? It has to work. What did you touch? You didn't break it? I think it ran out of battery. Where's the charger? -The charger... -You didn't bring it. Never mind, there are no sockets here. You filmed the first shot. How does it look? Crappy. Now what do we do? We'll go see my American friends. -What if they don't remember you? -Sure they will. I worked with them tons of times here. Then I used this place for my movie. Is that why it's about Romans? Greeks. Was the movie silent because you didn't have a sound guy? -Knock it off for a while. -You are finishing the script? It's almost done. Do you remember where I was? The man reached the end of the Earth. That's right. He got there by following his wife's trail. So he threw himself over the precipice. There he floated in the immense darkness of space... until... he found something. He found an old fountain pen he lost many years ago, when he was a boy. How did it get there? And not just the fountain pen. This place held all the things he'd lost at some time. His toy train was there. His teddy bear... He found his red woollen gloves, his little metal cars... and his favourite card album. The images were fascinating. He hadn't seen them for so many years. They reminded him of his childhood, of his toys at Christmas and the smell of his mother's zucchini purée. It also reminded him of his parents' house. Would they be inside? He wanted so much to see them again. But just then he heard a voice calling him. It was his wife's voice. Her hands were cold. She could no longer return to him. And he realized that he'd spent too long looking for her. In that time he'd forgotten the most important thing, his own son. And have you forgotten me? No, I haven't forgotten you. But I've spent many years thinking about your mother. As if I could still pull her out of the bath. People don't fall asleep in baths. Look, son, eight years ago... I was right here, filming. Your mother called me every day to get me to come home. She was always sad. Always. One day I stopped answering the phone, until she stopped calling. She never called again. Look, Ingmar, there are lots of things I haven't told you. Rita wasn't a producer. There were never any producers. And I stole the camera off a guy. Right. -I knew it. -How did you know? I thought you liked me believing your lies. Ingmar, most likely they won't let me take care of you. Then I'll take care of you. You're going to have to stay with Aunt Alicia for a while. I'm not living with Aunt Alicia, you hear me? Ingmar, they took away my home. Mine and my family's. That's it, it's all over. We're not going to shoot the film. I never intended to shoot it, we have no money. Yes, we do! We do have money. Where'd you get this? Did you take it from Alicia? What's wrong? I'm cold, this is to warm up. Come here. I'm not giving it to you! I thought you were a film director, but you're just a shitty drunk! Come here! Ingmar! Give me the bottle! Don't do this to me! Ingmar, where are you? Answer me! Fucking answer me! Ingmar... You were right, Ingmar. I'm a grotty old fart! That's why I need a drink. Ingmar! Ingmar! Let go of me. Come with me. Wait! Wait. Wait. You wanted to die. Why don't you do it once and for all? I felt so lonely, Víctor. Leave me, please. I missed you so much. I was waiting for you, Víctor. I was always waiting for you. I loved you so much... I loved you too... But not anymore. Not anymore. I don't love you anymore. Forgive me for shouting at you, son. It doesn't matter. Could you not always end up in a puddle? This was the last time, I swear.
