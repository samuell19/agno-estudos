♪♪ [TIRES CRUNCHING] [PAPER CRINKLING] TODD: Should have turned right back at that freeway. But I cannot... I can't read this thing at all. -Admit it, dude. -Dude, we are not lost. We're just not where we're supposed to be. I think that's called being lost. [SCOFFS] Shut up. Great. Now, what are we supposed to do? We've been driving down this road for hours. Hey guys, this is a wild idea, -but why don't we turn back? -Hey, listen, punk, nobody wants you here, okay? Including your sister. But somebody's got to babysit your ass because your parents are out of town. And they sure as shit don't trust your goth ass home alone. Hey leave him alone, alright? He probably wants to be here about as much as you want him here. Besides, it's your dumb ass that got us lost. Whatever. He's probably right, though. We should turn back. Fuck that. I can barely even see the road. We're camping here tonight and we'll figure it out in the morning. What an idea. I bet you two are glad we picked you up, huh? Well, that's what happens when you hitchhike. But hey, we're cool. And that's the fucking attitude I was looking for! [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] Cozy. Did we bring any flashlights? There are two in the back. Okay. [LAUGHING] -You have to jiggle it. -I am jiggling it. No, you got to really jiggle it. I am really jiggling it. [LAUGHING] Like this, baby. [DOOR POPS OPEN] -Yeah. -There you go! -Yay! -There we go, you just got to sweet talk it a little like a woman. [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] BETH: Thanks. At least there's one real man around here. Oh, I'll show you a real man. [LAUGHS] Stay off my girl. [LAUGHS] -[GROWLING] -What the hell was that? -Probably just a coyote. -No way, that did not sound like a coyote. What are you, a wilderness expert? It was probably just a rabid raccoon or something. If you don't bother them, they won't bother you. Actually, they will bother you. And if they're rabid, even if they're unprovoked. What are you, a wilderness expert too? Actually, yes. I used to be a professor at Berkley. Joe taught zoology. Oh, nice, we got our own little private nature show. [LAUGHS] Fact of the matter is, there are no raccoons out here. Only coyotes and an occasional mountain lion. But with all the commotion you've made in the last ten minutes, I don't think you have to worry about that either. Good times. Look, I got some sleeping bags in here. And I've heard good things about body heat. Besides, seven of us sleeping in this? -Not good. -Whoo! -JOSH: Wazzup! -SARAH: Oooh. [DISTANT LAUGHTER] [VIDEO GAME SOUNDS] You coming? PETER: No. I'm not really in the mood to watch you guys get drunk and grope each other. Point taken. [VIDEO GAME SOUNDS] This is fun, huh? JOSH: Yeah, that's right. It is now. Thanks. [GROANS] So what are those things over there? Oh, those are incense from Kathmandu, Nepal. They burn longer than any others, up to six hours. A friend of mine, a Buddhist priest, taught me how to make them. Now, I sell them at the colleges when I lecture. -Helps fund or trips. -What kind of trips? Carolyn and I travel the world. SARAH: Hmm, doing what? Exploring, enjoying life. Generally avoiding the politics and rat race of teaching college. And the nine to five thing. I did that for 15 years. Where have you guys been? I guess the question is, where haven't we been, right? Nice. -I like that. -[ALL CHUCKLING] [video game sounds] -[CHEERING] -[LAUGHING] JOSH: Going to [MUMBLES] his phone like that? Get it girl. Pump it up. Pump it up. [LAUGHTER] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [RUSTLING IN THE DISTANCE] [LOW GROWLING] [RUSTLING] Woah. Sorry. What's going on, man? Nothing. Turn the headlights off and come sit with us. I promise Josh won't be a dick, okay? [LAUGHS] Okay, Josh will definitely be a dick, but... come anyways. It'll make your sister feel better. Alright? -[SIGHS] -Come on. Guys, what's the craziest thing you've seen in your travels? I guess I'd have to say that time when we were... in India on the coast. We saw this ten-year-old boy, he was just like, gliding on the water, on top of an elephant that was swimming to an island about a mile and a half or so out in the ocean. It was just... incredible. I'd pay to see that shit. BETH: What about you, Joe? I don't know, that was pretty incredible. He doesn't really like to talk about it, but Joe's seen some pretty crazy shit. Tell them, honey. Tell the about Everest. I don't think that's the kind of story they want to hear. No, that sounds good. Tell it, dude. It's kind of morbid. Even better. About ten years ago, when I was still teaching, I was asked to join a team of researchers, heading to the mountains above Nepal. Purpose of the mission was to search for evidence of the Yeti. What's a Yeti? It's like the cousin of Bigfoot, but it's all white with fangs and longer fingernails. Yeah, that's right. In the early '50s, an Everest expedition led by a climber named John Hunt resulted in photos of what was believed to be a Yeti. We were going to retrace his steps and see if we could uncover any supporting evidence. -Yeah, I know it sounds hokey. -Thought it was pretty silly myself. The team consisted of myself and some local scientists and one of my colleagues, Simon Malloy. By the third day, we hadn't found much and Simon was getting really frustrated, so he decided to head out on his own for a few hours. Next morning, when we woke, Simon wasn't in his tent. He hadn't come back. The team and I spent most of the next day scouring the area. Didn't find a thing. So he never came back? I mean, did you call the police? Local authorities sent out a search party, and the university did as well, but no luck. Eventually, they found a part of Simon's backpack. And a hiking boot. Both covered in his blood. So what do you think actually happened? I don't know. But Simon went out there to find something that evening. Maybe that something found him. [JOSH LAUGHS] Bullshit! What? That's bullshit! Woo-hoo-hoo, something found him! -Josh! -Believe what you want. But this kind of thing happens all the time. People go hiking, climbing, camping, and they just disappear. Sometimes they find the bodies... and sometimes they don't. Point is, nobody ever really knows what happened. Okay. Now, I'm a little freaked out. Yeah, whatever. I'm going to get some more beer. And if something comes and gets me, Todd, you take Sarah. SARAH: Oh, shut up! BETH: Drink, drink, drink. Drink, drink, drink, drink. Oh, come on, baby, drink it! -[CHEERING] -BETH: Shotgun! [LAUGHTER] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [EXHALING] [URINE SPLASHING] Need someone, uh, to hold that for you? Uh, no. I mean, that would be great, but I'm kind of with Sarah. Oh, that's okay. 'Cause I'm with Joe. But we have an understanding. We're not married or anything. You're not married to Sarah, are you? No, no, I'm not married to Sarah. Okay. Good. [JOSH LAUGHS] [BETH SIGHS] -JOSH: Hey. -Hey! Oh my God, I'm so wasted. Me too. Aren't they beautiful? JOSH: Uh-huh. Not as beautiful as you. [BOTH LAUGH] God! Come on! Wow. That's really smooth. JOSH: Thank you. Oh, my God, I'm seriously drunk. Okay. [BETH LAUGHS] I'm just going to. Oops. [BETH LAUGHING] [MOANING] -We can't do this. -[JOSH MUMBLES] [HEAVY BREATHING] [GROANING] Oh, my head. Make the ringing stop. Hair of the dog, bro. That did absolutely nothing. You know, like one of my old football coaches used to say. "Quit your whining and rub some dirt on it, boy!" [LAUGHS] [VOMITING SOUND] SARAH: Hey. Yeah, this is just about right. Try turning her over. Battery light's on. It's probably dead. You're fucking kidding me. We're like, screwed, totally screwed. So we're stranded. Can't we like, fix it or something? Once it's dead, there's not much you can do without another fully charged battery. It's alright. Someone's bound to come along sooner or later. Until then, we got plenty of food, water, supplies. Actually, that's not quite accurate. What do you mean? Well, I figured that we would just get some supplies once we got to [MUMBLES]. So what do we have? Beer. And? Two Slim Jims and a jug of water. -We're dead. -We're not dead. Carolyn and I have been in far hairier situations than this. But we do need to be careful and conserve our water. What about when that runs out? And no one's come to find us? Then we die. Hey, eyeliner, shut the fuck up. Jesus, he is creepy. How is he even related to you? Let's just concentrate on what we need to do. It's obvious we're going to be here for a while, so let's start by figuring out what supplies we do have. Alright? JOSH: Looks like I was wrong about the Slim Jims. Humans can go weeks without food, but that amount of water for seven people? In this environment? Even for a day or two, that's a whole different story. So what if one of us heads back down the road or something? I can do that. You sure you're up for it? Yeah. Yeah, I can deal. Can't be more than a few miles or something. Remember to take water. And the rest of you take it easy. Try to conserve energy and supplies. And stay out of the sun. Last thing we need is someone passing out. Todd will get some help and we'll be out of here in no time. Yeah, right. I just love you so much. I love you too. Oh, hey. Uh... take these cell phones. Yeah, thanks. You never know when one will work better than the other. We're going to be fine. Be back soon. Hey. I love you. Love you too. So. I don't want to talk about it. Are we pretending that nothing happened? Yes! Look, I don't know. Look, last night was the biggest mistake of my life. And if you care anything for Todd, you will never tell him. We were drunk. I love Todd. End of conversation. -Lover's quarrel? -Hmm? What happened last night? What do you mean? Well, I thought you and me had a moment, I thought we were going to, you know, continue with it. [SCOFFS] I... I got tired. I went to bed. Oh. Is that before or after you fucked Beth? -Were you spying on me? -No. Well, it's just that if you're going to fuck your best friend's girlfriend, you might want to do it a little bit, you know, further away from everybody. -You are not going to tell him. -Depends. JOSH: On what? [CHUCKLES] On what you're willing to do for me. What do you want? You know what I want. -Seriously, now? -No, not now, but... soon. And trust me, sport, I am a much better lay than drunken Barbie over there. What if I don't? Who knows? [SIGHS] Do you think that Todd will find help? He's a smart guy. In good shape. You didn't answer my question. I don't know. The desert can be pretty unforgiving. One mistake, or a wrong turn and he can be lost for a long time. That's what I thought. Hey, thanks. CAROLYN: You're welcome. She's still in the sun. I told her to stay in the shade, but she didn't listen. CAROLYN: She's going to dehydrate. Oh. She called me "grandpa." Great. You know Joe's right. We don't have enough water, and if you keep laying out in the sun you're going to get dehydrated. I think I can handle it. Besides, I'm making the best out of this situation. Maybe you older types need to worry about that kind of thing, but I'll be fine. -So, you and Josh, huh? -SARAH: What about us? Oh, nothing. You guys make a cute couple. -SARAH: Thanks. -CAROLYN: So how long -have you two been going out? -Oh, yeah, it's pretty new. Oh, so it's soon enough that you two can, you know, see other people while you're seeing each other? -What are you talking about? -Oh, nothing. It's just that I saw Josh and Beth together last night. You saw them what? Certainly looked like they were doing a lot more than just talking. Sorry. -Can we talk? -Sure. -What's up? -Uh, not much. Thought you might want to tell me. I don't know what you mean. Nothing you want to possibly throw out there? Nothing you want to clarify? Um, no, but that's probably because I don't know what you're talking about. Okay. Fine. Where the fuck are we? Well, I think we're still south of the main interstate. How far, I have no idea. Could be two miles, could be 50. BETH: Hey. -Shouldn't he be back by now? -Not necessarily. I mean, he could pretty much-- Oh, God, you think something -happened to him, don't you? -JOSH: Hey! -Oh! -[BETH GASPS] Are you insane? BETH: What? He barely drank any of the water. I didn't want to waste any on myself when I didn't find anything. You didn't see any signs or anything? Nothing but... sand and rock. And the road just seemed to vanish. No tire tracks, nothing. That's what I was afraid of. -Of what? -That the wind would wipe away any sign of tire tracks on the road that we came in on and make it look like everything else. Would have kept going, but it's just so fucking hot. What are we going to do Joe? I mean, no car, no food, no phone. We're going to be fine. Alright? It's going to be dark soon, so let's... let's get some rest, and then tomorrow we'll figure out what to do. And what if we don't? What if all your degrees and your worldly know how get us nowhere? Then what? -It's not going to get to that. -How do you know that? Well, how do you know? I don't. Well, then why fucking say that? -Why fucking get our hopes up? -Alright, easy. You don't know! And you! How the fuck did you get us so lost? Haven't you ever read a fucking map before? -JOSH: Are you kidding me? -Shut up, Josh! Hey, hey! Cut it out! Cut it out! The minute we lose our heads is the minute this becomes a dangerous situation. So relax. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] JOSH: Hey man, I want a piece. Pass that shit on. Holy shit! Uh, headlights. I see headlight! JOSH: What? Oh! Let me see that. Shit! Maybe they stopped, settling in for the night. We can go get some help. Yeah, but what if they're gone tomorrow, dude? Shouldn't we try to get their attention? TODD: Yeah, Yeah. Try this man. Flashlight. Maybe they'll see it. Either they can't see it, or they don't care. [LOW GROWLING] [LOW GROWLING] Beth did you hear that? Hear what? I don't know, but it came from over there. BETH: It's probably the wind. It didn't sound like the wind. What they hell was that? -Guys, wake up. -What's the matter? BETH: Wake up, wake up. -[SNORTING] -[RUSTLING] Right. Everyone get in the van. -What's going on? -There's something out there. Nothing out here. but dust and wind. [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] JOSH: So what did you see? Not a thing. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [URINE SPLASHING] [SNARLING] [URINE SPLASHING] [GROWLING] [GROWLING] What the fuck? [GRUNTING] [GROWLING] [RUSTLING] Fuck! [GROWLING] [LOW GROWLING] [SNARLING] [PANTING] [ROAR] [ROAR] Wake up, wake up! Wake up! Dude, what the fuck is wrong-- -[BANGING] -[ALL YELLING] [PANICKED BREATHING] -[BANGING] -[METAL BENDING] JOSH: What is that? -[BANGING] -[ALL SCREAMING] [SCREAMS] -Oh, shit! Oh, shit! -Peter! -What did you see? -I don't know. I'm not sure what I saw. I was just taking a piss when-- -[BANGING] -[ALL SCREAMING] [METAL BENDING] [WHIMPERING] Oh, my God! [SNARLING] -JOE: I think it's leaving. -[SOBBING] I think it's leaving. BETH: Whatever that was, we should not be here when it gets back. That did not seem like a normal desert animal. That's right. Todd, you saw it, right? No, I saw a glimpse of it, but not enough to tell you what it was. I'll tell you what, though, it sure as shit was not a coyote. I'm not ruling anything out completely. So what the hell are we supposed to do now? Just sit here and wait for it to come back? Looks like it's gone for now. Who knows for how long. Holly Shit. Guys, come here! You got to come look at this! JOE: Oh, my. What do you think it was doing? I mean, why do all this damage to a car and then leave? If this thing follows the general temperament of a predator, it was probably scouting the area out. Attempting to show us who's in charge. Or it was just toying with us. Okay. And on that upbeat note, let's get this baby fixed and get the hell out of here before it comes back. I think we probably got about ten hours of sunlight left. I suggest we get to the other camp as quick as possible. -Yeah. Josh and I will go. -What? That's like 15 miles away. I'm not going out there. Fine. If they head straight in that direction, they're bound to find it. Alright. Just head for those mountains, alright? Try to keep a steady pace. It's going to be hot. You know that. Probably into the hundreds by noon. And if you run into whatever the hell it was we saw last night, my only advice is to run. -Hey. -Hey. You sure about this after yesterday? TODD: No, but I want to do this. Come on, dude. Let's go. You fucked him, didn't you? Don't try to deny it. She's a devious little slut. At least she didn't pretend to be my best friend, and then fuck the guy I like. -She told you that? -In so many words. -And you believe her. -Well, can you give me a reason not to? Oh, my God. -I'm sorry. -You're sorry, that's all you can say? Don't talk to me again. -Sarah! -Fuck you. Woo. Everything alright? -Bitch! -Oh, my God! -Bitch! -[BETH AND CAROLYN SHOUTING] Hey! Hey! -Get her off me! -JOE: What is going on? What are you doing? Nothing. I don't want to talk about it. [BETH CRYING] I'm too old for this shit. Hey. Did Dad teach you that? What? Gee, I don't know, your kung fu moves, maybe? Yeah, he did. Remind me not to piss you off. Look, I'm sorry I had to drag you into all this. It's not so bad. This is turning out to be an interesting little road trip. [BOTH PANTING] You think we're going to make it out of this? Dude, we're going to be fine. Well... this is a... good of a time as any to tell you this. I'm going to ask Beth to marry me. Dude, did you hear me? You sure? What do you mean, "Am I sure?" How about, "That's great, Todd. That's awesome!" Yeah, you're right. That's great, really. -Wow. -Come on, man. I'm your best friend. It's my duty to be the voice of doubt. Where the fuck did you hear that? Man, we've been best friends for the longest time. That's why it makes this hard for me to say, -but-- -Just say it. Well, is Beth the kind of girl you think she is? What kind of cryptic fucking shit is that, man? -Never mind, dude. -No, no, no, no, no. Why'd you say that? Look, last night Beth was drunk. And I was drunk. But she was really drunk and... [TODD LAUGHS] Fuck you. You're lying. You're lying, right? Beth would ever fucking touch you! Do you know how hard it was for me to fucking tell you this? I'm sorry, I fucked up. But is Beth really the kind of girl you wanna marry? You really did it. Stay the fuck away from me! Oh, my God. JOSH: What? What is it? Okay. We watch each other, we keep moving, no stopping! [SCREAMS] Help! JOSH: We need to get in the van. Now! Come on! In the van! What is it? Did you find the car? -We found it. -CAROLYN: And? They were all torn to pieces. Ripped open. Whatever that thing is, -we got to get out. -[BANGING] [SARAH SCREAMING] Shh, shh, shh! Quiet, it's okay. Shh. -[BANGING CONTINUES] -[SARAH SCREAMING] Shh, shh, shh! [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Are you insane? I want to see what that thing is. It's something that could kill you. I know, Sarah. I saw what it can do. But the only way that we're to fucking survive is to see what it is so we can deal with it. Otherwise, we sit in here and wait for it to come in the van. Right, professor? I hate to admit it, but he's right. The more we know about that thing, the better our chances of surviving it. See? And Peter outran that thing. He's biggest fucking pussy I've ever seen in my life. If he can outrun it, so can I. Okay? Be careful. Okay. I think it's gone. Hey guys, I think it's gone! [ALL SHOUTING] -[GROWLING] -[ALL SHOUTING] Pull the door! Move, move, move! -JOSH: Joe, where's Carolyn? -JOE: Carolyn? Where's Carolyn? Where's Carolyn? [GROWLING] [GROWLING] [SCREAMS] Carolyn! Come on! Get off! [CAROLYN SCREAMING] Carolyn, Carolyn! God! Get off her! [GROWLING] [CAROLYN GASPS] I'm here. [CAROLYN GASPING] [CAROLYN TRIES TO SPEAK] [CRYING] -I'm here, I'm here. -Joe. Joe, I've been thinking. Why do you think that the thing just left without dragging Carolyn off or coming after us? The incense. Yeah, I mean, look at them, they're everywhere. What if that thing was detracted by the scent of the incense? Animals have been known to have serious adverse reactions to certain odors. It's how they mark territory or... show dominance. [CAROLYN GASPING] Oh, God. I got to get out of here! I got to! JOSH: Hey, wait, wait, wait! -[SARAH SHOUTING] -JOSH: Stay in the van! What are you guys doing?! Get back in the van! JOE: I don't think we need to worry. What the fuck are you talking about? That thing is still out here! Because now I'm certain it's nocturnal. What are you willing to bet our lives on it? Right now, the only life I care about is fading fast in that van. So you can do whatever the hell you think is best. But if you ask me, you're not going to see it again 'till tonight. -TODD: She doesn't look so good. -BETH: You think? Guys, what the hell are we going to do? She'll die if we don't get her to a hospital. Oh, yeah, let's fly her to a hospital, Todd. Or maybe we can call in an ambulance. Or better yet, maybe we can make a make-shift gurney out of fucking tumble weeds and cactus. You're such a dick. That's a person you're talking about, Josh. JOSH: Hey, I'm sorry, Beth. I feel bad for Carolyn, but we're fine. And we don't have enough water for ourselves. What is that supposed to mean? Now, we're not going to give her any water? -She'll die. -Yeah, I'm pretty sure she's already bought a ticket on that train. Okay, take it easy. Just stop and think for a second. There's gotta be something we can do. Josh What, bro? What can we do for her? There's nothing out here! We have a first aid kit with some band aids and some tape. -What are we supposed to do with-- -I don't know, alright? Listen to yourselves, you're fucking retarded! [GRUNTS] [INDISTINCT ARGUING] -[SCREAMS] -[SQUISHING÷} [GROANS] This is insane! Is that what you wanted Josh? -Are you fucking happy now? -No, no, it's just, at least she's out of her misery. -BETH: You make me sick! -Me? -I'm not the one who dropped a rock. -Yeah, but you don't seem that fucking broken up about it, do you? Stop! You all better just pull your heads out of your asses and understand something! If we don't figure something out, we're all going to die here! Okay, you got that? So we don't have time for all this frantic college-kid bullshit! You all better get a grip on the situation before I got to throw a rock on someone else's head. -PETER: Are you going to be alright? -Considering? No, no. But I'm clear-headed. That's what we need right now. You know anything about fixing vans? No, I don't. Do you? Not really. Joe, I do have an idea, though. Guys. So if we're going to get through this, we need a working car, right? JOSH: Yeah, one with a working battery. That's right. So get your pack. We're going to go get the only other car we know. It's too late already. Listen, I'm 42, you're 22. If I can do this, you can do this. Now, shut up and get your goddamn pack! We're going to be running most of the way so grab the rest of the water. -What about the rest of us? -Peter will tell you what to do. [GASPING] Drink, you're getting dehydrated. Fuck off. Suit yourself. Do you think this will hold? TODD: It better. It's all we got. Oh, sweet Jesus. Okay. Let's just get this done. Hopefully, she'll just turn over and we'll drive her right out of here, alright? Come on. [FLIES BUZZING] -Dude, I can't do that. -All right. Jesus. Try to crank her over. See if it starts. [ENGINE TRYING TO START] I guess our only choice is to take the battery back to the van. I'll work on that and you look for supplies. Now, pop the hood. Ah. Ah! -JOSH: What happened? -Fuck. Fuck! [INDISTINCT DIALOGUE] He told you? Yep. Would it help if... I said that... I regret every minute of it and I'm completely disgusted with myself? Not really. Okay. Wait. Do you love me? I mean, there had to be something between the two of you. Something missing between us. I know that there's nothing I can do to change what happened, but... I'm sorry. Look, the fact is, I love you. I love you more than I've ever loved anything in my entire life. I can't just forget and forgive. -I can't. -So that's it? [SIGHS] It's getting late. PETER: It's time. They can still make it. [WIND WHISTLING] -Oh, my God, there they are! -SARAH: What? Oh, good. Okay. [GROWLING] Run! [GROWLING] JOSH: Go! Go, go! [PANTING] [GROWLING] [JOE SCREAMING] PETER: Come on! [JOE SCREAMING] [GROWLING] [ALL YELLING] [GROWLING] We only have so long before that incense dies out. Josh! Josh, you're the only person here who knows anything about cars. I need you to get out there -and fix this van-- -I am not going back out there! Listen to me, you fucking coward! That thing, it is just waiting outside for this incense to dies out before it come busting in here and kill us all! Get the fuck out there and fix this van! Okay, okay! Pop the hood, pop the hood! [GROWLING] Pop the hood! Come on! [GROWLING] [JOSH YELLING] [GROWLING] PETER: Todd, find the keys, find the keys. -Hurry up, Todd. Hurry up. -I'm looking, I'm looking, -I'm looking. -SARAH: Josh, calm down. Are you fucking kidding me? The bag must have ripped. The keys fell out. The bag must have ripped. What? Oh, my God. SARAH: We're dead. What the fuck are we going to do now? TODD: Pray that those things make it through the night. [WIND HOWLING] [GROUP SCREAMING] [GRUNTS] -TODD: Beth! -[BETH YELLS] Beth! No! Beth! Help me. No! You mother fucker! [ALL YELLING] SARAH: No! No! [SOBBING] [CRIES] JOSH: I know you're pissed. She's gone, bro. We got to let her go. We got to worry about the ones that are still alive. [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] -[GRUNTING] -[PANTING] What's the point? In a couple hours that thing will keep prowling for us and all we have for shelter is that dinky little car. Listen to me, all that we have to do is hang in there for a little bit longer. And we're going to get the keys, and we're going to get back to the van. And we're going to get out of here, okay? That's something that I can promise you. We're almost there. We're almost there, right Todd? [FLIES BUZZING] Great. Too bad we don't have any more incense or we might actually survive long enough to use those. Yeah. Actually, I've been thinking about that. I know that this is the last thing that we're going to want to do after hiking all day, but I think that we need to get the bodies into the car with us. -What? -Look, I know it feels like a long shot but... I think that if we mask our scent with the scent of these bodies, then we're going to make it through the night. [CHUCLES] I know this isn't much of a weapon. I wasn't really looking forward to this trip to begin with. -Sarah. -What, what? What's wrong, what? Do you see it? No, actually, I think the body thing's working. We all fell asleep. We need to sleep in shifts. So Todd can take the first shift, and then you and then me. Okay? Todd? Todd! Hey! Come on man. [PHONE VIBRATING] Phone. That's my phone. Phone. Find the phone. That's my phone, get it! Get it. Hurry. It's my phone! Wait, wait! Where is it? Hello? Hello, Daddy? Daddy, can you hear me? Oh, my God. Dad! Dad, can you hear me? Oh, my God. Okay.
