- Hey! Turn that off or I'll call your dad on ya! - Fuck off or I'll smash your windows in, mate! - Fucking kids. Don't touch them. Why are you here? - I need to stay a few days. - Well, I don't want anyone else here. - It's your place. - A few days. You know where you're going. You're a beautiful boy. You are a beautiful boy. Oi, calm down, calm down. Yeah, you're all right, you're calm now. - This has gotta be the worst display of coin dropping I've ever, what was that, man? - You've got it rigged, man. - I ain't got nothing rigged. You just put 'em in, like-- - Look at that. See what I mean? They're all glued or summat, them. You ain't got the skills, mate, you're crap. - Prizes are crap, shut up. - How dare you. Fucking hell, look at you, man! Bloody hell, you're looking massive, when'd you get in? This morning. - Brilliant, good to see you, man. Nice to have you back here, welcome to my playground. Took over from me dad, living the dream. The whole thing is fucking dead half the time, man. I'm bored out me bloody bollocks, man. I'd sell it in a heartbeat, if I could. Anyway, how's you, man? Fucking, how many tours is that now? Must be a few, women and that on the frontline, then. Oi, man, stop messing with the machine. What's wrong with ya? - Are you in t'Army? Should I be scared of you or something? - Yeah, he'll take you outside and bust you up in a minute, if you're not careful. - What's the point in that? I'll bust him up in here. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. - Get up off the floor, man. What's wrong with you, you little monkey? Jesus Christ, man. This place is sick, man, I tell you. If a bomb was to drop on it, there'd be more cheers than bleedin' tears. Oi, I'm going upstairs. Stop bashing me machines. All right, let's grab a brew, man. Working hard as normal, are we, princess? You see anything sticky, pal, don't touch it. - Fucking shit at this, man. Can you take your shoes off me couch, please, for fuck sake. It's not a palace, I know, but fucking hell. Have some respect, Jesus. Fucking hell, look at this, man. It's getting bloody worse, man. I'm sick of telling them to move. These girls are coming over from Amsterdam on the ferry, right, that's why this place is fucked, can you believe it? Coming here from Amsterdam to be prostitutes. What's bloody next, the French coming over for baguettes? You're not gonna bring your kids here with that outside, are ya? Police don't do fuck all about it. Should just turn this place into a brothel. At least I'd make some bloody money there. You know, that's not a bad idea. What're you doing back here anyway? - I'm looking for Jess. - Jess? Adam's bird, man, I heard about that, mate. That's fucked up and I know you two were close. I'm sorry, man, he was a good lad an' all. You lot remember Adam, innit? Oi! Can you turn it down, please? I'm having a fucking conversation here! You know, with words and that, the stuff that grownups do. - No, 'cause it ain't real with the volume turned down. - It's a bloody game, it's not real anyway! Right, I can't find fuck all, mate. I thought I had a beer and that. Pina colada. - No, I'm fine. Any idea where I can find her? - I think she's working at The Unicorn, you know. Do you know it? - Yeah. Well, is she doing okay? - I've not seen her in ages, to be honest, mate. She took it hard, man. Right after the funeral, I saw her uptown, and she was off her head, man, she didn't even recognize me. She's in totally different circles and that, now, man. I mean, they're the ones who had it hard though, ain't they? Right, man, I got a bit of birthday sponge, and these bits and bobs, mate. I ain't done any shopping in a while. But, yeah, help yourself, mi casa su casa and that, pal. Right, am I allowed to smoke, please, or have I quit? - Hiya. - Yes, mate? - I'm looking for a friend. - Yeah, everyone's looking for a friend. What can I get you? House rule, mate, you gotta buy something. - Water, then. - Water? That's a fiver, mate. - The hell are you doing here? Well? - I wanted to see you. Not like this. Can we go somewhere? - I'm working, Dean. Why would you come here? Jess, wait! - What do you think Baz, yeah? Fucking thing makes no sense. - Could work. - How could it work? It's not in fucking English. - The girl says it all for me. - "Learn to fucking pole dancing." - I've fucked up, haven't I? - Yeah, you've fucked up. Fix it. Sit down, love. Yeah? You all right? - Yeah. I'm tired. - What was all that about tonight, then? - Nothing. - You left the stage. Who was that fella? - No one. "No one." Baz clocked him. He's a hawk, Jess, looking for something. Looking for you, right? - He was an old customer, wanted a dance. I didn't like what he said, so I told him so and he left. - It's not a problem, then? - No, it's not a problem. Can I have my money please? - Easy. Anyone gives you any trouble, you tell me. You understand? - Yeah. - Hey, hold on. - I can't afford that, you know I can't. - Did I mention money? I'm giving it to ya. And don't look so fucking ungrateful. I'm giving it to you, to cheer you up. Hm? Well, come on, I need my fork. I'm just looking out for you, yeah? - Yeah. Cheers. - Why're you still here? Deal with it. - Now? - Yeah, right now. Whenever you're fucking ready. Off you fuck, now. - All right. - "Learn to pole dancing." Dozy fucker. - "'Come on, let's go. I'm playing the roundabout instead.' "As they whizzed around on the roundabout, Poppy said, "'Thanks for saving me, Fluffy.'" - Hiya. - Hiya. - Sorry I'm late, I couldn't get off. - Right. - Has he been all right? - He's been very good. I'm gonna have to shoot off. I didn't know you were gonna be so late. - I am so sorry, Sally, I owe you one. Did he eat his dinner? - No, he didn't eat very much at all. It's a phase, don't worry. Look, as much as I love you both, I'm busy, you know? You can't keep doing this. - I know. - Bye. Miles is not a happy man, Tony. - Yeah, and neither am I. - Brought you a little gift. - How many you got in there? Show me. - Count them yourself, mate. - You bastards. You... - You all right there, Tony? I heard a bit of a fuss out here. Here, do you want me to call the police? - Everything's fine, Betty, go back inside. I've got this! Looks like health hazard to me. Are you sure you don't want me to phone the police? - Piss off, Betty, and mind your own business! - Arsehole. - These ones get buried together. They're considered dirty. A pest. That's bullshit. They're true fighters. It's Paddy. He was a fast little bugger. Always back first. Led from the front, he did. - What happened to them? - They don't deserve this. Pigeons that served in the war were decorated and buried for their bravery. They saved thousands of lives. It's more than could be said for most soldiers today. - Dad, what's going on? - If you won't be minding your own business, you can fuck off. That's right, walk away! That's your answer to everything! - I don't wanna fight with ya. - Then don't ask stupid questions! You think you're a good person now. You shoot people, so you're a real hero now. You've no idea what it's like here. You've no fucking clue. - Believe what you like. - Hi. - Hey. - Sorry for just dropping around like this. Hiya, Tony, you all right? Thought you might be here. Do you wanna go somewhere? Sorry about the clutter. Was in a bit of a rush this morning. Do you want a drink? - Some water? - Sorry, it's a bit warm. Tap's not working or something. - Thanks. - Zack will paint on anything. Dead creative. Like you to meet him. - Oh, I'd like that. - He's at school. Loves it there, paints all day. - He looks just like Adam. - I am quitting. Your dad looked tense. - Yeah. Is everything okay? I mean, are you coping? Yeah, I'm coping fine. Wish that I could eat more vegetables. - I didn't mean to embarrass you at the club. - You didn't embarrass me. Was just a shock. It's a bit strange seeing you, is all. Do you wanna go? Just. Someone's improved, haven't they? Or maybe you're just lucky. Close your eyes. Use your instincts. Two out of three ain't bad. What do we win? One of the little ones, love. - Which one do you think Zack would like? - I trust you'll be able to take care of everything? It's an important night for me. - Of course, don't you worry about that. I was wondering if I might put in a, uh, special request, as it were. A personal one. - Always happy to accommodate, Brian. - Um, I'll go for that one. - Okay. - You know that guy? - I work for him. He runs the club. Come on. Thank you! - Bye. - Bye. I love it here. Like quicksand. Whoa, I'm sinking! Come put your feet in, it's dead nice. Go on. Whoa! I'd like to take Zack on holiday. Somewhere exotic. So what brings you back to this paradise? - To talk about Adam. - Adam was so bad at the guitar. 'Cause he never had any of them lessons. He'd say he was, but... He was here. With me. Just us. It's hard enough seeing you come back to life. We better get going. Hiya. Here, your bag. What's that? - Picture. Oh, wow, who's that, then? - You. - Is it? When we were at the beach together. - Oh, wow. Zack. This is Dean. - Hi, Dean. Hey, buddy. - You drew that today, didn't you? Dead good. - What's that? - Say thank you. - Thank you. - Do you fancy joining us for tea? - You need to be more careful, Tone. You left the door open. - Ain't nothing worth stealing here. - No. Guess not. - How's your family? All good, I hope. - Yeah. Yeah, good. Kids are good. Johnny's birthday tomorrow. We're having a big party up at the house. Yeah, lots to organize. His mother's gone to town on this one, we've got all sorts. Bouncy castle. Even one of them clowns. Getting him a horse. Also his mother's idea. Yeah. Anyway. I didn't really come here to talk about that, Tone. - You oughta be careful, I just finished painting that one. - What is going on with these pigeons? I'm getting a bit concerned. I hate pigeons. Filthy creatures. - So? Are you going to talk about something? - Half my shit is out there somewhere. Floating about in the North Sea. - Well, we always lost a few grams here and there. - I'm not talking about a few grams. - I told you not to increase the amount. Their stomachs can't take it. - Even allowing for the dead ones. Doesn't add up, Tone. You need to tell me why I'm losing so much money. - So, you wanna call it a day, then? - No. But I'm expecting some honesty from you. Are you keeping a little bit to yourself? Making a little bit extra on the side? - I ain't. And I really don't appreciate you coming here, accusing me of something that was your idea in the first place. What about my birds? I lost loads of 'em on this one. I don't owe you shit! - Okay, Tone. I've upset you. Sit down. Grab that whiskey from the shelf, will ya? I love my wife, Tone. But I wouldn't wanna go into business with her. Emotions. Business. They don't mix. So, you've got a day to think about how much you owe me. - I ain't skimming. - Just... Spend a little time thinking about it. It'll come to you. And I'll help you. Now just pop your hand on that table. - These are the legs. That's one. And that's two. Okay, left leg-- Thank you. - Right leg. - Cheers. - Okay, that's good. - Yeah? - Try the arms. - Go on. Carrots for arms, carrots for legs. I'm gonna finish mine off. Okay, what else do you need? What about that one for a mouth? Did you write this? - Adam wrote them when he was in Afghanistan. Did he not show you them? Some of them mention you. - "Smiles of a Blind Owl." Mom, will you read it? - Maybe later. - It's good. - Please? It's my favourite one. Please? - All right, all right! - Please! - Okay, go on. "A baby owl was born one sunny day. "Healthy he was, and the month was May. "Except one problem. "This owl couldn't see. "With eyelids fixed shut, opening was key. "This baby owl lay still in a tree, so tall. "If his eyes stay shut, he'll have a fall. "The owl's parents... "Watched him close. "They kept him safe. "And loved him most." - Mommy, why have you stopped reading? Why are you sad? - "But this baby owl showed he could fight. "Tried opening his eyes, with all his might. "With strength and desire, he opened his eyes. "He jumped from the branch, the owl, he flies. "With his smile so wide, he showed us all. "To us forever, he's our priceless jewel." - I've finished! - Did you have a nice day? Can I have Mr. Potato Head now? Thank you. He'll be there in the morning. Go on. Goodnight. Thanks for today. - It was fun. - Adam let him draw on the walls. Give me a sec. Hiya. I'm not on tonight, am I? - No. No, no, no, love, this is something else. I need you to come in. There's good money in it. - It's a bit late, isn't it? I just put him to bed. - I don't care, Jess, get down here. It's only a few hours' work. - I can stay, if you'd like. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. - Babe, are you there? - Yeah, I'm here. All right, I'll come down. - Good, wear something glamorous. - Okay. - Hey. - Is that all right? - Of course. - Will you check on him? - Mm-hm. - Thanks. - What took you so long? The girls are waiting! - I got here as quick as I could. Well, you look smashing, babe. Heels are good. - So, what's this tonight, then? - You know Brian Mackie? Old fella, owns Pleasure Island. - Yeah, yeah, he comes in sometimes. - Well, he's having a swanky thing tonight. Drinks, canapes, all that. I need you to go, yeah? - What for? - Just gotta look after them old fellas for the night. Stacey's going. - It's not my thing. - Oi, he wants English girls, right? I don't have many, so I need you to go, yeah? - I'm not touching him. - Jess, you'll do whatever the fuck he wants. I'm not selling this to you, I'm telling you. You're fucking going. I care for you. Don't I? Don't I always take care of you? - Yeah. Yeah, it's just not my... It's just not my thing, that's all. - Would I ever put you in any danger? Baz? - No. - No. We look out for each other here, right? I told him that I'd sort this, babe, so don't let me down. The money's good, you're good. You're going. Hey, before you do... Dress up your face, or something. Put some slap on, yeah? You look good though, don't she, Baz? - Yeah, sexy. - Very. Off you go. Fucking hell. - Please go through. - Great party, Brian. - Well, thank you for providing the entertainment. - It's a pleasure. Get a chance to look at the paperwork yet? - Ah, I'll take a look on Monday. - You do that. - Jessica. - Hiya. - This is Mr. Mackie, our generous host. - Lovely to meet you. Great party. - It's just an excuse to have some pretty ladies about the place. - Honor to be here. Wouldn't you say, Jess? - Pleasure. Everything's a pleasure tonight! May I? - I thought you'd like this room. You know, I own Pleasure Island. For now, anyway. You used to come when you were a kid, didn't you? Hey? Yeah, I remember you. Well, bring yourself over here. Come on. Go on. Is the music the problem? - No, the music's fine. - Are you crying? Hey? - I'm sorry. - Don't you fucking cry! - I'll dance for you. Dance? What the fuck? - Please. - Turn around. - No! - Turn around, come here! - Get off me! - Come here! - Get off, get off me! Get, get off! Jesus Christ, what is this? Hey! You're fucking paid for already! Is everything all right, Miss? Jess? Jess, are you okay? Jess, let me in! - I'm okay. It's the middle of the night, what's going on? Are you hurt? - I'm fine. I just lost my shoes. It was a long night, is all. For God sake, I'll come through this door, if you don't let me in! - Listen to me. I just need to be on my own, okay? I wanna help. - Well, you can't. I don't like this. - Then leave! God, we're not kids anymore! You can't just come and go as you please! When Adam died, where were you? And now you wanna what, you wanna bash my door down? I don't think so! - Just let me see you're okay. - Return of the prodigal son. Thought you'd gone for good. - Well, I'm leaving now. Can't you see I'm busy? - So, that's it, eh? - What you want me to do, walk you to the bus stop? Pigeons are intelligent creatures. Wherever I release them, they'll find their way back home. But if I let them go from here, they'll fly away and never come back. So fly the fuck out of my loft, why don't you? You go and live with that fucking slut. - Don't speak about her. So, where did you get it? The fun fair? Yeah, in Pleasure Island. - Can I have him? - No. - Why not? - It's mine. - Well, what if I take him? - You can't. Cheeky. But Pete had just told me he wanted to come with me. He says he doesn't. You chuck him out the window? - With a parachute. - With a parachute? - From upstairs. Well, then we won't see if he flies if there's a parachute, will we? - Or we could use a water gun to make a jet pack out of a water gun. - Morning. I thought we needed a little chat. Tea always tastes better sweet, I've put two sugars in. - Zack. Zack, go to your room. Go on. Mommy needs to talk with her friend. - You should always do what your mommy says. Mommy always knows best, yeah? Go on. - Hey, make sure you close the door, huh? - We'll go for an ice cream when I'm finished. - Nice kid. Doing what he's told. Is that all right? Yeah? - Yeah. - You remember what I said to you, Jess? I'm sure you do. 'Cause, uh... I stressed the importance. - He was gonna hurt me. - Didn't get what he wanted. That's the issue here. Makes me look bad, Jess. Makes Miles look bad. - All right. - It'll make this easier. Come on. You know, I wanna be fair and reasonable. - If I've cost you, I'll make it up to you. - No, you can't, Jess. Jess. You can't be making mistakes like this. I don't think you understand the shit-storm you've created. I'm sorry. - You're one of my girls, right? - Yeah. - If I don't do something, how's it gonna look? - Don't, I don't... - Get up. - Please. - Get up. - You don't need to do this. - Come on. - I couldn't do it. - Hey. I just wish you'd done what I asked. Who plays that one? - Who plays what? - That. That, what's that? - Behave yourself, man. This is why I don't let you up here. Just messing around, man, it's a brilliant bloody game. - I don't even play it and you're like twice my age. You're the only one I know who plays that. - Yeah, you don't have the mind of a structural genius, do you? How do you think fucking Brunel got started? - Who's he? - It's not even about the game, it's a bleeding philosophy, "who's he?" This is why you should be in school and not around here, man. All right, what you got, man? - Right, I've got... I've got some weed. Not much coke, though, hardly any there. New batch of pills, I think. - Hark at Boots over here. What's your bleeding name, Superdrug? I'll just have the weed please, mate. - I'm sure last time you got the coke. I'm joking. - Come on, right, I'll pay you next time for that-- - No, no, 20-bar there, come on. Smash it in there. - Come on, man. Ticket me, you know I'm good for it. - You said that last time, so this is next time, and I want the money for that hand I just sold you as well. - Fucking hell, man, you're gonna do me like that, man? The last shit was shit, mate. - So what? You bought it. Put it in there. I thought you kept your money in your Koran. - What's that? - Don't worry about it. You wanna take that for road? - No, no, I don't smoke that shit, man. Mom said I should quit, bad for me asthma. - Your mom's probably right. Probably the smartest thing she's told you to do. All right then, well, fucking hell, what're you up to? Nowt, just been at home. Just chilling. - Give me a bell later and that, if you wanna hang out. Yeah, yeah. - I'll be down in arcade and that. We'll play a bit of Street Fighter or whatever. All right, man, see you in a bit. - Right, make sure that don't fall. - Make sure it don't, I knew you'd do that, you little twat. I'll see you in a hour, yeah? - Yeah. - Just text me or something, I ain't got any credit. - Right. Hey, army man? Bang! - A little menace to society, that one, I'll tell ya. How's it going anyway, did you find Jess? Oh, whoa! Fucking hell! You want a go? - Nah, I'm leaving soon. - Oh, all right. Lovely day, though, man. Promenade and that will be packed. Absolutely scorchio. Hopefully we get a few get a few punters in arcade and that, man, normally get the families and that down here on a... - Jess? You in there? Jess? Jess? - I was just imagining Adam coming to rescue me. And here you are. Shower's broken, the toilet won't flush. Have to boil the kettle every time you want a bath. Then there is that damp on the ceiling. - What happened? - It was like I could see myself falling. Felt free. I hit the ground. But why am I still alive? - Who did this to you? - I fell down the stairs. I'm so stupid. - Do you wanna sit up? - No. No. The bath's helping. I'm worried about Zack. Does he need me? - Who's that? - Mommy's friend. Sit. - I'm not staying. - Then say what you've gotta say. - Jess. I want her out. - You want her out? What do you mean, "out?" What's that mean, out of a job? Has she put you up to this? What is she to you? Are you sweet on her? - What do you think, Connor? They kinda pulling up? - What do you reckon, do you like 'em? Strut about. Mm. You don't wanna look at that arse, do you? Too busy looking at me. Are you sure they're all right? - It's a reasonable request. - Fucking insult me, I took that bitch in. She needed me, she came to me! I don't think you understand how this works. - How she gonna work, looking like that? - That's her own fault. - Who's that? - Sit down and shut the fuck up! She messed up. - She's had enough. - Yeah, I don't think you get it, mate. These girls are here to make me money, so unless you've got a stack of cash in your back pocket, I don't know what you're doing here. - I don't have money. - All right, then. - I can work for you. Where we going? - All right, stay in the car. - Where are you going? - They didn't fucking tell me. - Come here. Come here. What are you doing here? - Oh, I thought you might need me. - Oh, so you haven't left yet, then? - Oh, you know this guy? - He doesn't know shit, the fucking filth. - Yeah, he liked to beat his kid. Give us it here. Come on, move. Tell them what they want. - Oh, I hope you're enjoying this. - Tell them. - Yeah, I bet you are. - I swear, I'll take your hand off. - You haven't got the balls. You're fucking dead! Come on, move. - I'm not leaving without me fucking birds. What did they want? Why the fuck does it matter to you? What the hell are you doing here anyway? - I didn't know you'd be here, I was protecting Jess. - What's Jess got to do with it? - She owes them money. - Always the hero. - What's this about? - I get this stuff over from Amsterdam. How? - In the birds. I put it in their stomachs and fly it back on race day. Small amounts, it was fine, but, Miles wanted to fly more back. Their stomachs couldn't take it. - Who's Miles? - I'm not giving them anything. You really messed up. Best thing you can do is get the fuck out of town, and don't come back. You're good at that. You need to pay this guy back. - I don't owe him shit. - He ain't gonna stop 'till he gets what he wants. I need to know Jess will be safe. I can't let anything happen to her! I'm gonna go and find her and I'll come back. - Your kid like any particular animal? - Horses. - Do you an ostrich? - He likes horses, doesn't he? Ostriches are interesting. Mate, do me a favor? Make me a fucking horse. Yeah? - Miles, good time to talk? - No, it's not. - Oh, okay, just so you know, we had a slight issue. - What issue? That can't go there, stick it over there. - Well... The fucker escaped. - What do you mean? - This fella was gonna do some work for us, and he's turned on our boys down at the docks. And he's run off with the old man. For fuck sake. Who is this guy? - He's shagging one of the birds. I know where he is, so don't worry. - Do I sound fucking worried? - No, no, no, no, I just thought you might-- - Look. What with that bitch sending the Pleasure Island deal south, my mood's not rosy at the moment, yeah? So you find the guy and sort it the fuck out. - Oi, mind your language. Don't want the kids in tears. - Sorry, love. - We'll rough him up, yeah? - Just sort it. - Want a chip? - Yeah, all right. - That was a fuck up, wasn't it? - It was a total fuck up. They're fucking horrible. - I'm popping out, love. - What do you mean, you're popping out? The rest of the kids are arriving. Hey? - Dean? - How you feeling? - Better. Lie with me. Please? I missed you. Just for a moment. - We need to leave. - Why? - You're not safe here. - What have you done? - Stay here. Dean! Dean! Dean, Dean! - Up! Up! Up! Bang, bang, bang, bang! I need you to look after them for a few hours. Yeah, man, of course, no problem. I'm in tonight. - We were doing just fine. I can't let anything happen to him. - I know. I'll put this right. - Do you actually believe what you're saying? You think you can make a difference? You've started a war. - Adam is dead because of me. - What? - Because of my mistake. - He's the father of my child. Don't you think it's hard enough already? What do you want, forgiveness? What did you do? - Adam loved you both so much. He never stopped talking about you. We were away for so long. And there was this... Young boy. And he was crying. Adam ran straight up to him. I should've known. The boy had a grenade. - So, you came back to tell me this? - I'm gonna go now. Please leave this place. - Down? - Down? You're gonna go there. You can't teach this to your friends at school, can't you? - I can. - Up, come on! Up! Up, up, up, up! Up, up! Come on, out you go, come on! - So. That's it, then? Their racing days are over. We had a good thing going here. I'm in a corner, Tone. I don't know what to do. You seem incapable of being honest with me. Maybe... Maybe you're right. We should call time on it. I mean, what's the point? Not making any money, am I? - Perhaps we could work something out. - Tried that. - Just leave them other two alone. They've got nothing to do with this. Ladies, we're going to do a routine with arms and spins. Let me have a look. That's it, so you really work the core. Engage those abs, that's it, just like this. - Hey, what you think you're doing? - How many Ns in Johnny? What the fuck? Fucking hell! - Miles, where does he live? - You out of your fucking mind? - Where does he live? - Fuck you. Where does he live? I can keep doing this. - Yes, love? - Hello, is Miles home? - He is, yes. He's in the garden. We're having a party today for our lad's birthday, so we are a bit busy. - That's nice. - Yeah. Best you call back tomorrow. - No, I have something for him. - I'll make sure he gets it. Oh, it's best I give it to Miles in person, you know? - What did you say your name was? - Dean, I'm Tony's son. - Oh, okay. - They raced pigeons together. - Oh right, sorry, sorry, I just wasn't expecting you today. - I'm happy to wait. - No! Come in, just, um, take those boots off. Had our floors polished. Won't be a minute. - Can I help you? - Yeah, I think you can. - Not a smart move to come to my house. Hey, kids, come on outside! Inside's for adults. - Let's get away from the kids, shall we? Drink? Your old man. He liked a good scotch. So. Why are you in my house? - That's everything my father stole from you. - Really? - I'm not here about him. My friend, Jess, works at The Unicorn. - Yeah. I know her. - I want her to be left alone. - In exchange for this? This is mine. You've just returned what your old man stole from me. That's all. As for your girlfriend, well, that's another issue. You do understand the two things are separate, yeah? And she has fucking cost me. Fucking pick up! Oi, you definitely saw him, right? - Yeah. - Now you can't be fucking wrong about this. - What do you suppose I do? - In all honesty... I can find nothing comforting to say. - I want Jess to be safe. - Yeah, well, I'd have agreed to something, but now? You've made that impossible. You've come here. You've scared my wife. Taken me away from my lad's party. You've brought this, to my fucking house. Now... I wouldn't take this from anyone. Why would you be any different? Yeah? - Miles, sorry to disturb. This guy's coming to you. - I'm aware of that. All right, well, I know where the girl's hiding. - Where is she? Nate's Arcade, beachfront. - Good. Get down there. - Fucking hell. You, you, with me, let's fucking go. - Right. This is what we're gonna do. I'll take what's mine, yeah? 'Cause that's fair. I won't touch the girl. She's okay with me, but Connor... - No, no, no, no! - Stand back, babe. - No, please don't shoot! Please, please, please! - Can Mommy have that? - Now, kid, you see anything, you tell me, all right? - We're gonna go now, sweetie. Hey! Hey, open the door, you cunt! - All right, fucking hell, calm down, less with the cunt. - Let us in! - Open the fucking door! - Fucking hell, what happened to you, man? - I'm gonna rip your fucking face off. Fucking for what, man? - Come here! Stay the fuck there! - Where is she? - Stay the fuck there! - Jess! Jess, where are you? - Fucked it up, that weed's going to your fucking head! - What've I fucking done, man? - Where is she? - Just shut your stupid fucking... I swear to God I'm gonna smash your fucking face in! - Don't know, man! - Where is Jess? I'll do it, I'll smash his... - Jess! You are so fucking dead. Natha... Hey. Whoa. - Fucking hell. - Where is she? Is she safe? - She's fucking gone! What the fuck have you done, Dean? Fucking hell, Dean! Jesus Christ! Sit down, man, fucking shit! Fucking hell, man! Where's my phone? Fuck. Ambulance, man, I need an ambulance! All right, sorry, I'm calm, I'm calm. I'm at the arcade on Sea View Road. Someone's just been fucking shot. I don't know, man.
