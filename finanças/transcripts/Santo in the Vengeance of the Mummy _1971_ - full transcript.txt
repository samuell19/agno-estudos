(dramatic music) (gentle music) - In front of a very excited crowd, with a full house here at the Monumental Arena, Mexico, the final match for the tag team championship begins. Santo, the famous silver-masked man, accompanied by Rebel, faces off against the undefeated Italian tag team, Gori Casanova and Angelo. Santo is using his famous agility, and is moving perfectly, as usual. Angelo will have to be very agile if he wants to get rid of Santo's supreme ability. Santo's leg movements have made him famous all over the world. This Italian tag team is very aggressive. They have captured the attention of fans not only in Europe, but also in the United States and all Central America. We now see Gori Casanova hitting Santo very hard. Those open hand slaps from his right are destroying Santo's body, even though he is in incredible physical condition. That counter attack was barbaric. Harsh! The Italians' invincible tag team is now being brutally punished by Santo. He is used to doing this, thanks to those fights that have made him famous all over the world. Here we go, oh, and here we have one of Santo's known moves. He is hitting his opponent in the back against the turnbuckle to take his breath away. The crowd is excited to the point of delirium. There he goes out of the ring. They're watching as Santo prevails. Just hear those cheers and roars from the crowd. Now Rebel is receiving tremendous blows. He is the young rookie who is teaming with Santo, and he is proving that he is quite good in the wrestling business. However, the Italians, Angelo and Gori Casanova are determined to not only take away Santo's undefeated streak, but also wish to unmask him to reveal his identity. Rebel can't shake off the attack but he finally gets the tag from Santo. And look how the Italians retreat to their corner. They can't make up their minds on who will continue the fight. And Santo attacks them with arm blows. He seeks to defeat both of them but it's not possible, although Santo is a tremendously strong man. Here he goes. Oh, look at the, a wonderful mack throw, using the right arm, the power, two on one, but look at that amazing double take down. That's the strength of Santo. Just look at the crowd going wild. Now, Santo has caught him in an inverted headlock, but he goes again for the double take down. The crowd roars wildly for their great idol. Rebel tags in, goes on the attack again against Casanova and Angelo. Oh, look at that. Great strikes with the forearm as only he knows how. This stadium is sold out here at the Monumental Arena, Mexico. What a grueling match, and we're just starting the first fall. Great punishment by Rebel, all legal moves. Oh, here he goes. Look at that amazing jump from Santo. What a brave man. He follows with a double knock down, and then sends his opponent to the corner. Again the crowd is going crazy for Santo, their idol. He and his partner have controlled the Italian tag team and won the first fall. The crowd is ecstatic, and so are we, for the great triumph in this, the first fall of the tag team championship. - Santo! Santo! Santo! - Now the crowd takes a bit of a break as we now enter into the second fall. Rebel starts the match by attacking the stomach of his opponent. Oh, now a blow to the jaw, and finishes it off with a great arm throw. But the two Italian boys are tough too. Nice kick. Here comes Rebel. He's going for the pin, but now he's under heavy attack by Angelo. Gori Casanova lives to fight another day. Meanwhile, Santo yells at Rebel to watch out. The great master gives a lot of advice to Rebel, who is also proving to be a very good fighter too. But now he falls into the trap of the invincible tag team and they are very angry, because they have never lost a fall. They normally triumph with two falls in a row. Santo jumps in to help. The referee is unable to help Rebel, who is being severely punished. And the match now goes to the outside, even when that is against the rules. And now Santo is prey to the terrible fury of the Italian tag team. Gori Casanova and Angelo. They both go for Santo's stomach. The silver masked man has no partner now, because Rebel is very hurt, but he defends himself as he is used to by making use of all his strength and enthusiasm. But it's impossible against two men who weigh almost 220 pounds each. Santo is taking heavy blows to the jaw and gut. Santo has a steel abdomen, but he is now bending over. It's not humanly possible to defend against such tremendous punishment. Now they're using the turnbuckle and the ropes against him. They wanna break his arms, but he resists and doesn't give up. It's amazing how much punishment he can endure. And this might be harmful to the Italian tag team, because they could seriously hurt him and the match would have to be stopped. Now we see an illegal stomp of Santo's neck against the bottom rope. The referee simply has no way of controlling this angry tag team. Oh, but Santo gets up and tries to fight back. The crowd is worried. Their idol is in trouble. He receives a double abdominal stretch. Oh, and he finally gives up. The second fall goes to the Italian tag team. The match is now tied. And here we have the Italian tag team, celebrating their victory and gloating their greatness because they can still live here undefeated. The crowd is nervous. Now begins the third and final fall. Oh, Gori Casanova punishes the rookie, Rebel. Oh, what a heavy gut breaker, right on the ribs. Rebel is hurt. Oh, the punishment is tremendous. Up again, oh! He lifts him like a feather. The damage is building up. The boy is almost unconscious. The attack simply don't stop. Check that combination of back and leg stretcher. Rebel gives up, and now Santo is left alone to face the Italian tag team. Will he be able to take them on? It seems to be a task only Santo could achieve. Now we see an exchange of body blows. Magnificent hooks to the stomach. Both men trying to counter attack. Gori Casanova is a beast of a man. But that last hook to the jaw was devastating. And Santo is using his favorite weapon, the thigh kick. But the situation has changed, and now he is getting hit against the ropes. Oh, right on the jaw. Powerful strikes to the ribs. Santo couldn't hold out any longer. He shows signs of being hurt. Santo looks tired. His leg muscles loosen up a little. And now the tag team goes at it again. Santo is now using everything he has left to counter attack. What a tremendous effort. Oh, watch out! He's gonna be crossed by a 220-pound man. However, Santo is very intelligent and escapes. Gori hits his own partner out of the ring. Now Santo goes to the Irish whip, followed by his trademark overhead slam. The crowd roars with excitement. Santo again with that wonderful combination. One, two, three! Santo has defeated one of the tremendous Italians. Angelo is gone. Yes sir! But now here comes Gori Casanova. He falls directly into Santo's hands. Santo uses his strong arms to repeat his favorite slam. And now he goes to the cattle clutch. That's his signature move and Gori surrenders. Santo beats the Italian tag team on his own. This also marks the first defeat for the Terrible Sicilians. They have fallen to Santo and his rookie partner, Rebel. - I asked you to come because I want you to be part of a great discovery. Sometime ago, the institute sent me this special codex to study. I have deciphered it, and to my surprise, it indicates the place where Nonoc, great and powerful Apache prince, was buried alive for having violated the law of the maidens consecrated to the king of the gods, Sukol. - And what is your plan, Professor Romero? - Well, to organize an expedition with the specific goal of locating the tomb. I'm convinced that we are going to find some very interesting things. I have gathered you because I believe you are the right people to carry out this project. Of course, an anthropologist is indispensable for this task, and no one is more suitable for this than Professor Jimenez, given his great knowledge of the subject. - Congratulations! - No, please Professor. No, please, it's you, Professor. - Me? - Yes. - Thank you. - Of course. Engineer Sergio Morales, a man who has demonstrated his knowledge and abilities in this organization, during the planning of previous expeditions. Ms. Susana Sarevan, the famous and expert photographer. She will be in charge of filming and verifying what we find in our travels. The most efficient and courageous secretary, Ms. Rosa Bermudez, who will obviously be taking notes of everything now and then. I don't want to hide from you the fact that we could run into countless dangers, especially if we find the wonderful treasure of Prince Nonoc. That's why I took the liberty of inviting my dear Santo to come with us. With him by our side, we shall be safe. Thanks to his courage and bravery, known to all of you. - Thank you, Professor. It will be an honor to go with you. - I believe you can count on all of us, Professor. - Of course. - Thank you very much. I knew from the beginning what your answers would be. Now, if you allow me, I will give you all the details of where we're going. The location of the vegetation covered grave is here in this area. The place where the proud Apache race built their incredible empire in the deepest, darkest part of this jungle. - This is far as we go. - Look what I found, Santo. The botanical pasero. - And what's that, Professor? - I don't know, give me a hand, please. Thank you. One time in the jungle, I found something this big. I said, "It's an ostrich egg." But no, it was a coconut. - You, unload that quickly. Put it there. - Excuse me ma'am. Do you know Monsieur Agapito? - Yes sir. - Where does he live? - In that little house. - Oh, thank you. - Hey sir, that costs three pesos. - I thought these were jicamas. - Look grandpa. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Are you Mr. Agapito? - Yes. - We understand that you are the only guy that can take us to the place where we used to explore. - Yes. But I refuse to go with you. - Why? - All of you intending to desecrate the tomb of Prince Nonoc will only find certain death. - But our interest is purely scientific, sir. - Come on, son. - Wait. This boy, what's his name? - He's my grandson. - Does he have any other relatives? - Have you ever thought about what will happen when you're gone? - No. - If you agree to be our guide, once our expedition is over, we promise to take care of the child's education until he's an adult, ensuring his future. Think about it. - Excuse me. - And you foreman, have you got the men ready? - No, sir. - Why? - Where is this thing milked from? - It's a horse, professor. - What do you mean a horse? Oh my God, since they made these lenses with plastic, I keep shaming myself. - They're afraid. As you know, this is the last point of human civilization. From here out now, lies the damn jungle, with the swamps... - Well, I hope they make up their mind soon. Otherwise, we'll go to another town to find the people we need. - Well then, have you decided? Look, they're going to pay us very well. Besides, haven't you heard that they're looking for a grave? - So what? - And in that tomb, there's a fabulous treasure. (birds chirping) - I can't believe I'm going down this path when I can find all this stuff in my backyard. That's crazy. (panther growling) - Stop, don't move. (laughing) We can continue. (horse braying) (panther growling) - Oh, Santo. But how can you be thinking about playing with a cat? Look how late it is. (chattering) - I'm absolutely certain that by digging this underground tunnel, we'll get directly to the crypt we are looking for. - Yes, indeed. The calculations seem to be correct. We've been working for some time and the discomfort has already began to be felt, especially by Susana and Rosa. - Don't worry about me, Mr. Morales. This is my job, I'm used to it. And I'm really happy to do it. - That's fine. I guess I was wrong. - Professor. Professor! Could you put all these charts in order? We are going back into the tunnel. - Huh, what did you say? - Please Rosa, could you take care of this, huh? - Don't worry, Professor Romero. Come with me Professor, please. - Yes, of course. - Let's go. - Professor. Professor. - What do you want Bruno? Please guys, go ahead. I'll catch up. What do you want? - I have carnitas. - But you know it's only been an hour since you gave us breakfast, Bruno. You held us up for that? - What's that got to do with it? No, no, no, no, no. Get out. Yeah, of course. Yer damn naughty scoundrels. (generator whirring) (ominous music) - Santo, what I still don't understand is why our ancestors made so many tunnels and chambers. - They had a definite purpose. To throw off the intruders, so they would never find their graves. - I believe we are finally in the center of the mountain. - Exactly! We are definitely in the center. - There, that must be where the entrance to the crypt is. - Professor, I think we should break down that wall. - Of course. (somber music) Those are the stairs, the crypt staircase. I'm going down there. We have to be very careful. Santo, I believe we finally put an end to all those sleepless nights. - Careful. (ominous music) - I found him. I found him. It's Nonoc, the great Apache prince. - Congratulations Professor. This is a great discovery. - Thank you. Please Sergio, please ask Professor Jimenez to come here, please. - Right away, Professor. - The papyrus. The papyrus. Nonoc, the great and legendary warrior prince. Great among the great. Champion of the empire. Here are the highest exponents of the Apache civilization. War, music, their daily life. - How wonderful, how wonderful. - We found it, Professor. We succeeded. - Let me look at the plates, Professor. - Yes, Professor. Use this magnifying glass, please. - Oh my God. This is authentic. - But I don't understand it. Look Professor, this is written with different symbols. - Let's see. No, it still has some vestiges of Apache dialect. - The white man must not disturb the peace of the great Nonoc. - You were never in favor of us doing these excavations, were you? - No. - We could have used any of these other entrances. - What, are there others? - Yes, Professor, there are others. You must understand, we are doing this in the name of science, of civilization. - Civilization, which one. Of the white man? - You piece of... - Wait a minute, Professor. You are an Apache descendant, right? Can you translate what's written here? It will save us a lot of work if you agree to our request. Anyway, sooner or later, by using code books, we would find out. - I, Nonoc, great and powerful Apache prince write while still alive, in the solitude of my grave the facts I'm going to relate to you are true. And tell step by step my story of misfortune, which started many moons ago. And had it's culmination in the Sinam festival, honoring the king of the gods, Sukol. (somber music) My love for Lua was as great as the sun that shines on us. To my misfortune, she was destined to die since she was born in the name of Sukol. For that, she had to remain a virgin. No one could see her or touch her until the moment of her sacrifice. (dramatic music) Breaking the law, and knowing the terrible punishment I was exposing myself to, I was able to reach her and then I took her away. (dramatic music) Both Lua and I perfectly knew the punishment that awaited us. We ran desperately through the jungle. We knew that if we were caught they would kill us. Our only hope was to somehow mislead our pursuers. Little by little, Lua began losing strength. I invoked all the gods to help her endure such a terrible escape. (dramatic music) Then, with tears in her eyes, she begged me for stop to rest. I knew this was the end of it all. Laying my mantle on the ground, we set out to await our fate. We were fatally discovered by the great priest, who cursed us for our sacrilegious act. On the offering stone, the woman I loved was sacrificed by the great priest. I was led as a prisoner through the jungle on a grueling journey that lasted several moons, to the land of my ancestors, the Punchez, where I was to be buried alive in the funerary crypt to shame all my family. After I pay all my respects to the great and awful lord of the underworld, I swear I will come back to life, and my revenge will be extended to the generations to come and the descendants of those who sacrificed me. The day will come, when men driven by greed for the riches in my tomb will desecrate it, and one by one fall victims to my power. The air is running out and my body is losing its strength, but beware foolish profaners, one by one, you will be destroyed, for I, Nonoc, am an immortal. You've heard it all. Nonoc will come back to life. Nonoc is an immortal. (laughing) - You're kidding! An immortal mummy. - I don't believe any of that. In the old days, the Greek lords used to tell such legends, to frighten those who tried to desecrate their tombs in order to loot them. All these jewels will be conveniently cataloged and displayed in a museum. - The white man does not understand. The prophecy has been fulfilled, and we are all going to die. I'll be the first. I'm a direct descendant of the high priest who buried Nonoc alive. - Look, it's only a mummy. In all of human history, no mummified being has come back to life. He will return, and I warn you that if you dare to remove the command necklace from his neck, the events I tell you will be set in motion. And those crimes will not cease until the necklace is returned to Nonoc. - Well Sergio, tell the men to help us. We have to catalog this all very carefully. - Aye aye, Professor. - Susana please, take all these codexes to my tent. I wish to study them tonight. - Professor, you really need to rest. I haven't seen you stop since... - Please, Susana. - Oh God, the Icam sign. It's the sign of death. - Not you too, Professor. - But, but, this... - Please take that necklace and study it through the night. I'll store the other jewels in my tent. - Please Rosita, could you remove the necklace? - Hey Professor, you haven't eaten anything. Don't you like my tasty cuisine? - A lot. But you gave me too much. - No, no, no, no, no. I served you the same as the others and look at their empty plates. - Okay Bruno, I will be working tonight. So, if you would like, a glass of milk and cookies. - Of course, quick as a flash. You'll see. - Well my friends, have a good night. - Same to you. Let's rest, goodnight. - Crackers, Professor? No, look at my menu. (mumbling) No, no, no, no, no. No, no, it's not in French. The thing is, you have it upside down. - I had it upside down? Chili chiles and salsa verde, black bean soup? Well everyone, goodnight to you. I'm off to my tent. I wish to study the dead man's necklace. - But Professor, they're all gone. See, no one else is here. (laughing) - Hey, are you a cook or do you work in the subway? - Cook, sir. - A cook. Yes, yes. I've seen these before in the movies. Well, since you're a cook, why don't you prepare me that thing that you'll prepare tomorrow? - (chuckles) of course. Say what? - What would I know? - But... (whistling) So, you're stealing the meat, huh? Get outta here you thieves. Don't you see that's for tomorrow's lunch. People aren't afraid of you for being brave like you were wrench watchdogs. They're afraid of you because you're pigs. I don't know why they brought you to the jungle. In this place, we only want fine people, not like you filthy rats. (laughing) - Oh my, what's his problem? - Yes, he always overreacts. - What's happening here? What's wrong with him? Who knows? (somber music) (cat growling) (ominous music) (screaming) - Professor! Professor, the mummy! The mummy, Professor! Professor, the mummy! The mummy! The mummy, Professor! I'm telling you, the mummy! He's here. Hey everybody, the mummy, Professor. The mummy! The mummy. - Calm down. Calm down. - What's wrong with you, man? - Relax, man. Please, take it easy. Bruno! - The mummy... - What's going on? - The mummy, the mummy, mummy, it's alive, it's alive. I saw it. - Did you go into the crypt? - No, no, no, no. I saw it. I saw it over there around the trees. The mummy was there. - Have you been drinking Bruno? - No, no, no, no. - No, no, no, no. - Not even water. You have to believe me, Santo. The mummy, it's alive. It even shot an arrow at me. - Are you sure it shot you? And it was the mummy? - Yes, I swear it on my mom. It's alive. It's alive. - Okay, take me where you saw it. - No, no, no. No, no, no. - What? You already forgot where? - No, no, no, no. It's just, I don't wanna see it again. It would kill me. - We'll protect you. Look, I have a gun. Besides, we're all going with you. Come on. - No, no, no. No, no. No. It was there, near those trees. - Come on, let's go then. - Look, look. - It's from the crypt. I can't believe someone here would make a joke of this. - I've seen this arrow in movies. It could be from a redskin. - And it scared the hell out of me. - No, no, no, stop. - Help, the mummy came out of its crypt and it killed my grandpa. - He's dead. His neck is completely broken. - It's an Apache arrow. - Who did this? Who killed him? - The mummy. The one that was in the crypt. - Let's go to the crypt. - Rosa, Susana, take care of the kid. (somber music) - Listen, it's possible this cave has a secret exit. There are many entrances. At the break of dawn, we will start the search. - And for security, we'll put a permanent guard in the crypt. We will shake out all the caves in the camp, we must find that mummy. It's very important. It's just absurd to think it resurrected. - Yes, make sure everything is perfectly lit. And don't forget to put the light torches at each cave entrance, in case we might need them. - I'll start up the generator. - Two men will stand guard here. Come with me and I'll give you weapons. - Proscendo, Francisco, you'll take the first watch. - I'll use the radio to reach the institute to get instruction. I will tell them what happened here. - All right Professor, I go with the foreman to give the men weapons. Let's go! - Come with us. - You all better go to sleep. - We'd rather stay with you, Professor. - Don't be afraid. We'll put a gunman outside of your tent tonight. - And what shall we do regarding this little child? - It won't be necessary. You two take care of him. - We'll be happy to do it, Professor. - Come on, let's go to bed. We'll give you a warm glass of milk to calm your nerves. You'll be all right. - Put a gunman on the outside of their tent. - Yes, Professor. - And remember, I don't want any more hysteria in this camp. That goes for both of you. - Both of you? - No, I'm talking about you and him, both of you. - Because of me? - You and me alone. - Bruno, go back to the kitchen and don't cry. Don't be a crybaby. - As you wish, sir. - Understand? - No, how could you ask him if he understood if this jackass understands nothing? - I can't deal with you. (sobbing) - Go, go. This is incomprehensible, unheard of. How could a mummy just disappear? Or did it just walk on its own? (laughing) I'm just talking nonsense, aren't I? I don't even know what I'm saying. But we're facing a mystery, a terrible one. - One that has a logical explanation, Professor. Look, come with me to my tent and we will call the institute. (ominous music) (screaming) - The mummy! The mummy! The mummy! - Take it easy, Susana. Take it easy. - Calm down, Susana. And you too Rosa. - You don't have to be afraid. The mummy died thousands of years ago. - Then how did it get here, and who killed Agai? - It killed my grandpa. - Here, this is a mummy. It couldn't do it. It's scientifically impossible. - Yes, it was a mummy. The mummy, it will kill us all. My grandpa said it. - Sergio, take the mummy to my tent. Have them set up another tent for the ladies. - Yes, Professor. You heard it, come on. - Get in and take it away. - Take it away. Be careful. - Take it to my tent. - Okay. - We don't wanna continue. Our lives are in danger. Pay what you owe us and we are gone. - We agreed to pay you upon the return from the expedition. - What? It must be here. I didn't see the tent numbers but there's no other one. - Leave it there. - Anything else, Professor. - No, thank you. You can go. Although it's late, we have to call the institute. I hope someone answers. - Please call my friend, Mr... - Please stop, Professor. Please, take a seat, please. - I'll take this off. Won't you Santo? Well, me neither. - There's something wrong. I'll ask the engineer if he can fix it. - Don't go alarming people, Professor. It's better if they don't find out the radio's broken. You can do it tomorrow. - You're right, Santo. We will leave it for tomorrow. - Well then, I'll go to my tent. There's some really interesting hieroglyphs here, and I want to decipher them. - Professor, don't forget about the papyrus. There are very important things there for history. - Of course, don't worry. - This mystery has you intrigued, right Santo? - How else could I be, professor? - Look, I'm going to do something that will dispel any doubt you might have about this. - Sergio, thank you so much. You have been very kind. - Glad to be helpful, Susana. And don't be afraid Agapito. You'll be sleeping with Rosa and Susana, and no one will come into your tent. This gunman will take care of that. Well, time for bed. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Rest well. Come Agapito. - You'll sleep with us. - Your watch will end at midnight. - Yes, boss. (soft music) - Good evening. - Good evening ma'am. Is something wrong? - Oh no, it's nothing. It's just awfully hot inside the tent. I came outside to get some air. Hey, have you seen anyone else come out apart from me? - No one, ma'am. It's been very quiet here. - All right, thank you. I'm going to Santo's tent for a moment, okay? Santo! Santo! - What is it Susana? - Santo, Agapito is not in bed. The boy has disappeared. - Did you tell anyone else? - No, I didn't want to alarm anyone. - Well, don't Susana. Let's go find him. - Agapito! - Agapito! - Agapito! - Agapito! - Where are you sweetheart? Agapito! - Agapito! - What happened to him, Santo? We looked everywhere for that boy and he's gone. - All we have to check is the crypt. (gasps) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (screaming) (ominous music) Susana, turn on the lights. (dramatic music) - It killed my grandpa. I miss my grandpa and I'm scared. - Well, as you did wrong, you still have words. Now, don't say anything of this to the others. They will all panic. Let's go. (ominous music) (gunshot blares) - Santo! Santo! - Why did you shoot? What's going on? - I heard a scream from Professor Romero's tent. It sounded like someone was fighting in there. - What's going on? - Who fired? - Let's go to the Professor's tent. (screaming) - Who did this? - And the mummy, where is it? - The radio has been destroyed. - It can't be fixed. It's useless now. - And we're isolated in the middle of the jungle. Professor, take a look at this. - Incomprehensible. This belongs to the mummy's robe. - It's impossible. Don't tell me you believe the mummy's alive too. - I've said no such a thing. I just confirmed something that's obvious because I'm touching it. - No one can resurrect after 1000 years. - Yes, the mummy is alive, I saw it. - Be quiet. That's plain stupid. - We will only know the truth by finding the mummy. Follow me. - Come on. You heard the man, follow us. - No! Where to? - To the crypt. - We are not moving from this spot. - What did you say? - What you heard. Death is on the lose and we don't want to join it. - We'll make you go then. - You're gonna make us? - I will make you do it. - I'd like to see you try. (laughing) - He won't do it, but I will. (dramatic music) (laughing) - I am already tired. Take me to bed. - Really, to your bed? - I said it first. The guard we had, he ran away. Cowards. - Search the whole camp for them. And when you find them let me know. I'll be in my tent. - Come with me. - It cannot be. Yet here is the evidence. The mummy's footprints. - There's a lot of arrows and two bows missing. I cataloged all the weapons myself. - I think I'm going crazy. What do you think, Santo? - I don't believe in apparitions or resurrection either, but what's happening is beyond my understanding. We have to act quickly. We have to alert the authorities. - Now, what's going on, Santo? What happened to him, Santo? - Professor, we have to accept this reality. That mummy is alive. - That's ridiculous. - You men of science only believe in what you can measure in your test tubes and look at with your microscopes. But there are mysterious forces, evil forces known to the civilizations of old and the curse of Nonoc will kill us all. - Come on! Stop talking nonsense, Rosa. - Let's go back to the camp. We will assign double guards now. You Sergio, the foreman and me, will take care of the women and the teacher. - Hey, I'm old enough to take care of myself, okay? - Forgive me, Professor. But let me take care of the camp security. - Do what you wish. - They are gone. They've all run away, Santo. - Bastards! Damn cowards! - And now what's going on Santo? - They got scared and ran away. But we don't need them. - That situation is really dire. We must do something. We have to take care of ourselves. - No, Professor. The women and the kid, nor even yourself would endure the journey back through the jungle under these circumstances. One of us must go back and tell the authorities right away. - I can do it, Santo. - No. I will go, Santo. I'm used to it. Using a horse, I'll get back to civilization in a couple of days. - All right, I take you back to the horses. Make sure there is no shortage of wine and count the supplies. - I can help him. - I will handle the cooking. Agapito will help me, right? - Sounds very good. And you better not stay alone, Professor. I'll be back soon. - Well, let's go see what's in the kitchen. Follow me. (ominous music) - Those bandits took the other horses. - Fear overpowers men, Santo. At least they left the other ones here. - Ride that horse and go get help, hurry up. I will hide the others in a safe place. - Don't worry, Santo. I'll be back in four days. (crying) - What happened Agapito? Why are you crying? - I miss my grandpa and I'm scared. - Do you know something Agapito? Sometimes in life, really bad things happen that suddenly make a child grow up to become a man. - I'm already a man then. - You must be. Manhood doesn't come with age. There are men who already in their 90s and still act like children. Don't feel lonely. I'm pretty sure your grandpa is now protecting you from heaven, where he is now. - I have no one left. No one left in this world. - You got me. I will always take care of you. You'll be like a son to me. You can cry now, and when you are done, you won't cry ever again. No matter what, men don't cry. And now you're a man. (upbeat music) - Put it there. Look at that. - It's the foreman. - Something's wrong. - Come, come everyone. Come, that foreman is hurt. - Who did this? - The mummy is alive. - Make up your mind man, is it dead or alive? - He's talking about the mummy? - Ah, the mummy! It's dead. And soon we'll be joining them. We're goners. A mysterious and unstoppable force is destroying us one by one and nothing nor no one will be able to save us. - You shouldn't talk like that, Professor. 'cause now you're in charge of the expedition. - Me? No, no, no, no, no. Are you drunk, no, no, no, no. - Viewing professor Jimenez's condition, I will assume the leadership of this camp. - Okay. - We have some horses and a mule. We will load them with the most important supplies. It may take us a week, but we should leave this damn place. Then we will bring back the authorities. This crimes can't go unpunished. This is the least we could do for them. But I swear, I won't rest until I destroy that cursed mummy. (ominous music) - Look! - The supplies tent. - The cold solitude of death. - It's useless. We have no means to kill the fire. - But all our supplies are there. All our food and water. We can't go into the jungle without anything to eat, Santo. - The mummy doesn't want us to leave this place. It has a plan to destroy us, but I have a counter plan on my own. - It's no use. We're all gonna die. Every one of us. - Come with me. Around one pound of bacon, a pack of flour, some cookies and salt and a first aid kit. Using it all and hunting animals for food, we can reach civilization. - It's not enough food. We won't make it. - We'll make it work. We have the weapons and also the horses. I can assure you that horse meat is very tasty. Since the mummy destroyed our power plan, we'll have to eliminate a broad area so it won't be able to sneak up on us. - I can help you with that. - And I will finish packing the food. (soft music) - Susana, you're very brave. Thanks for your help. - It's I who have to thank you, Santo. Your energy and courage is what saved what's left of this expedition. - When we get back to civilization, I will be the luckiest man in the world. Then we can talk differently. - And what's stopping you from doing it now? - Forgive me Susana. I think that might have been the loneliness we are facing. Please forgive my words, Susana. - I think I understand, Santo. But rest assured that I'm very flattered by your feelings. - Susana. - Food is almost ready. - The mummy won't be able to surprise us. - Come on Professor, you have to cheer up. We are protected. The mummy can no longer attack us. We have weapons. We'll see tomorrow. We will all definitely be safe. - No, no, it's useless. No one will save us. Said so in the codex. Nonoc will destroy all who desecrate his grave. - But Professor, you're a great man of science. You can't be talking like that. - Sergio, the food is ready. - Come on Professor, you have to rest. Tomorrow we'll leave really early. - Help me Agapito. Bring me that plate. - It's a pleasure ma'am. - Time for bed, professor. Yes, Professor. - No, no, no Susana. - Yes, you have to go to bed now. You've been working so very hard. - Me, going to rest? - You have to rest, come on now. - I'm not even tired. - Hand me that stuff Agapito. It's way too heavy for you. - I will stand the first watch, and will wake you up at 3:00 a.m. We leave at dawn. - All right Santo. Goodnight. - I'm so tired. I hope we don't have any more setbacks tonight. We have to get out of this hell hole. - It's impossible for someone to attack us, Rosa. We all have guns. - And you think firearms will be able to stop the mummy? - There hasn't been a single case in the world of someone being immune to this. - I hope you're right. - Don't worry, Rosa. You can be sure of that. Agapito, it's time to sleep now. - I'm not sleepy yet, Susana. - Come on, you're a good boy. You have to obey all my instructions. I have something very important to discuss with Santo. - You really like Santo, don't you? - Agapito, don't say that. Come on, go to sleep. You think we will be safe, Santo? - We must. We have to show the world the wonders we found in this crypt. And also for something far more important to me. - What could be so important? - You, Susana. - Any woman would be so very happy if a man as brave as you could love her even a little. (ominous music) (soft music) (gasps) (gunshot blares) - What's happened? - It's the mummy, the mummy. - Look, the horses are gone. - Sergio. - Fortunately, it's a minor injury. The Professor! Take care of Sergio. (ominous music) Who attacked you? - It was the mummy, Santo. - Did you fall asleep? - No. I was looking at the tent when I heard a noise. I turned around quickly and that's when the mummy attacked me, Santo. Then I lost consciousness, and I don't remember. - And the Professor, is he alive? - Dead by an arrow. And the jewels and papyrus are gone. - We're doomed, Santo. Professor Jimenez was right. The mummy will kill all of us, all of us. - Try to remain calm, Susana. Be strong. - I'm scared, I'm so scared. Santo, please don't leave me alone. - I will always be with you, Susana. Always, I promise. Don't cry Susana. The Professor's death won't change our plans. Tomorrow, we will travel through the jungle. - Like this? With almost no food and no horses? - We can survive with the equipment we have. We simply can't stay another day in this place filled with death. Who did you shoot? - It was a shadow. I think it was the mummy. It came out of professor Jimenez's tent. - Okay, we will bury the Professor in the morning. You and Rosa will pack what's absolutely necessary. Don't forget ammunition. If we use our supplies sparingly, we can cross the jungle and come back with the authorities. I will continue guarding here. You two can begin packing. - Santo is right. We can't stay another second in this damn hell hole. Hurry up, they're almost here. - Susana, please take good care of the rolls of films you shot. They are very valuable. Perhaps, when the institute hears this discovery, the film will be able to give the answer to this mystery. Goodbye my friends. I swear I will return to avenge your deaths. (ominous music) (screaming) - It was... - Don't move from this place. Then shoot if he gets near you. - Yes. Santo, don't go, please don't go. (ominous music) Watch out Santo. (gunshots blaring) Be careful. - Don't do anything crazy. Stay right here. - I wanna go with you, Santo. - All right. Cover me. Light this. (gunshot blares) Cover me. (gunshots blaring) - Come on. Hurry up. Don't shoot anymore. I will catch him alive. (ominous music) Sergio. It's all over now. Many innocent lives were lost. Now we have to find the treasure and the papyrus. The whole world must know the wonders of this civilization. I told you Agapito, dead people can't come back to life. It's the evil of the living that will always harm others. (ominous music) (screaming) Don't be afraid, Agapito. This is the real mummy. Sergio hid it all the way here. You see, there's nothing to be scared of. You now know who the killer was. We should take the mummy back to its crypt. It will stay there until we come back. (horses braying) Sergio had everything set up for his escape. (crowd cheering) - A humongous crowd is here to see this great mask versus mask match. Santo, the crowd idol against Buffalo, a 244-pound man, who has challenged Santo to a mask versus mask match. To find out once and for all who the legendary and wonderful wrestler Santo really is. They are measuring their power. And now, hammer hold to the left arm by Santo. Santo is a resourceful wrestler. We must consider that Buffalo has trained consistently for more than three months for this match. No room for error on either side. Buffalo attacks with a full Nelson hold. The move is effective. This man has incredible power. Oh, but Santo shakes him off, what a throw? And now Santo uses an inverted headlock. The referee gets closer to the action. Buffalo is a tough opponent. Immensely strong and skilled and also has a large repertoire of techniques. Look at that cross leg take down by Santo. He aimed for the ankles and was able to bring Buffalo down. Oh, body slam. How can Santo lift up so much weight? Oh, Irish whip and he goes to the overhead slam. The whole arena felt the tremor of Buffalo slamming against the mat. And there goes a second overhead slam. Santo's looking for a submission, and he goes to the arm crucifix hold. He doesn't let go and, oh yeah he gives up. The first fall is for Santo. Remember, this is a mask versus mask match. (crowd cheering) Now begins the second fall. Santo, the silver-masked man versus the burly Buffalo. Oh, what a blow to Santos' jaw. Now he hits him hard with a closed fist to the gut. He strikes the jaw again. The punishment is cruel. But now Santo fights back. Trying to move this colossal opponent. Buffalo attacks with a charge. Santo tries to jump but he takes a heavy blow to the chest. Look at how Santo recovers. What a blow to the jaw of Buffalo. And once again, they begin exchanging blows. One for Santo, one for Buffalo. They're measuring their strength right now. This is the second fall of the mask versus mask match, and both men are giving their best. The crowd goes crazy. And everyone is starting to cheer. Most cheers go to Santo, who is once again putting the hurt on Buffalo. But look at that man. Powerful, incredible. He strikes up and down and once again, Buffalo wants to break Santo's jaw. I can see some blood below the silver mask. Santo is hurt. And now his eyes are also being attacked. He can't see right now. Buffalo is attacking ruthlessly. No mercy, right in front of the referee who isn't able to stop this punishment. And now he's attacking the carotid. But it's almost a direct strangulation. The crowd suffers just like their idol. Santo's mask is on the line. He could possibly lose it because Buffalo doesn't stop his combination of blows, and is completely destroying Santo's face. Santo is bleeding from his nose. Those attacks are devastating. We're all nervous for him. Now our palms are sweaty. There's a chance that in this match, Santo could lose his secret identity because Buffalo's dominating him right now. And the beast seems to be enjoying it. Now Buffalo uses a modified Boston crab on Santo. Santo surrenders, the match is tied. (crowd cheering) And so begins the third and final fall. Santo's power of recovery is incredible. Buffalo's now getting a dose of karma. He receives direct hits to the jaw with closed fists. Good hit to the jaw by Santo. The crowd is roaring again. Hopes are reborn for Santo to succeed in unmasking Buffalo, the burly animal. Right now, he's just a toy for Santo who is on fire. We have never seen a reaction like this from Santo. He is also delivering heavy kicks to the stomach. Buffalo seems to be hurt and he's also bleeding from the mouth and nose. And once again, the crowd is ecstatic for its idol. Santo, here he goes. Oh, it's the turnbuckle smash. Buffalo slams hard against the corner. His 244 pounds make the ring and the whole arena tremble with each slam. Oh, another slam. Here comes Santo. He climbs to the top. It's his suicide drop, bull's eye. And he goes for the cover. One, two, three. Santo has won. Santo now gets to unmask Buffalo. The fans scream, "Do it now," and he complies. Oh, Buffalo is Goliath Ayala. And look at that kid. It's Agapito. He's now in the arms of Santo, who gives him a tremendous hug. Glory to Santo, the idol of the crowd. (crowd cheering) (dramatic music)
