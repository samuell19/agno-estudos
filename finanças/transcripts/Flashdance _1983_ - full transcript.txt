I was gonna go yesterday, but I didn't have time. You must make the time, child. I know. Remember the first time you took me to see them dance? I have dreams about it. Dreaming is wonderful, but it won't get you closer to what you want. But I've put enough money away so that, if they do take me, I can support myself.

You see, Hanna was the one who wanted me to get the application, and I couldn't tell her that I just didn't have the courage enough to go through with it. If you had seen all those dancers, all those people. God, there's no way I belong there. It's just that I want to make something out of my life. I want to do so much, and sometimes...

ALEX: You loved her once, didn't you? NICK: I thought I did in the beginning. She was different from anyone I'd ever gone out with before. She was well-educated, came from a real good family. I'd figured that I'd really made it. And then one day I realized that I'd just taken the safe route. When I realized that, somehow it made it easier for me to do what I had to do. What was that? Let go. Start over again. Figure out what it was that I wanted to do and go after it. You got it, didn't you? Mmm-hmm. How did you do it? I took a deep breath and jumped. Hello.
