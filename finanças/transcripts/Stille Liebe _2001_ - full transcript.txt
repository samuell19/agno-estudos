This is how I met Antonia twenty years ago. It was a sign. I had come to help on the farm. We had been told that this family had difficulties. I was shocked that she still did not go to school. Hair. In the home they tried to make her talk, but she refused to. I looked for a teacher to teach her sign language. We taught her to read and write. She woke up. Frog. Monkey. Lion. Cow. Pig. Goat. Here we are not afraid of silence. Maybe this attracted her, or then it was the protection that this place provides. So it seemed quite natural to everybody that she came to us and wanted to join our religious order once she was a little over twenty. I was of course pleased to be able to accompany her in her life. In the morning I always went to her room first in case she did not hear the waking bells, but she was always awake already. I sometimes watched her secretly. She didn't notice or pretended she didn't. I may even have been a bit in love with her, but I suppose we all were in our little community... Shall I put that down, too? Yes. Antonia had adapted herself well to our little community. She always did what was asked of her. Later on, as the tradition of our order prescribes, she started to help with charitable work outside the convent... SECRET LOVE Is there any coffee? Hey, Sister Antonia! I'm sorry! I'm telling you for the last time: This is no hotel. All hotels full. He doesn't want to understand. OK. Just ask. One day maybe? Yes, yes, maybe, maybe. We're closing now until 4 p. m. Can you do some shopping? Do you think she noticed something? I don't think so. Wasn't she at the hotel this morning? I think they all look the same. Let's go back. Well, what was it like? How is Fritz? Will you come with me? What is this? Deaf actors. They make music with gestures. Antonia ordered the video cassette. I don't know if it's right to let Antonia work there. She's young and healthy. I did the same thing. Yes, but people talk and Antonia... She knows how to attract attention. Antonia says it's like when we listen to music. What? Stir? I can cook too! Looking for something? Two twenty. Two twenty. Thank you. Why are you following me? Aren't you allowed or don't you want to? Me? What? Don't you want to talk to me? You speak sign language like me. You are the first deaf person I've seen here. So what? You're waiting... I'm waiting. I'm waiting for the train. We understand each other. Understand each other? I meant to say that we can communicate. I don't know it. What do you do? I'm a nun. I know that. I mean at the hotel. I work there. We help the needy. The "needy"? Poor people who have neither money nor a home. Have you ever been to a circus? When I was little. I worked in a circus. I must go. Goodbye. Didn't you buy the newspaper? Forgot. Why? We have to work harder. Fritz phoned me. Is it so difficult? He's stubborn. You should be more patient with other people. Patience. A nice gesture. All gestures are nice. I shall talk to Fritz. Hey, you two! Stop! Wait! Egli! Don't strain yourself! Fritz didn't give you a room, did he? I'm telling you, you went about it the wrong way. Come to me next time, I know Fritz. My friend, sorry, I not understand. OK? At the hotel, a few days ago. - Russians? No! Why Russians? Money? No, no. What do you say about that? Antonia likes to show what she can do. She doesn't eat with us. That makes no difference. I don't trust anybody to cook something and then not eat it. A good cook always tastes what she cooks. You have to get used to it. Now a young nun is working here. One could say, what more do you want? Yes... but it's still stupid. It's a problem for you that she doesn't talk, that you can't talk to her. That's it! He doesn't like it. This gesticulating gets me confused! With Sister Maya, I could have a chat. Sister Maya is 70. It's too strenuous for her. You understand, don't you? You never want to read my slate. I need one, too. It isn't that bad. If he refuses to let me cook, I won't go there anymore. I really won't go there anymore. It isn't as easy as that, my child. You know that our order wants to help, the world needs us. And we need the compensation that we get for your work. Fritz is strange. Fritz is a man. They're different. But he's actually a good person, you'll see. And your brother? Not brother - half brother. Is it okay? Okay, okay. He has his room. So you can open the door yourself in the morning. Strittmatter, it's clean enough. Hey, that's enough! See you later. In the evening. ANTONIA'S MENU It's good today. Enjoy your meal. To the theatre? They're from America. From Gallaudet's school for the deaf. They act with gestures, like the music with gestures. I don't understand. Like a choir. Maybe one day, I'll be able to sing with you. Sorry. Never mind, it was an accident. Goodbye. Stop thief! Hey, stop him! He robbed me. What have we got here? A purse. And banknotes. He doesn't want to booze. He's all alone. He needs a room. I'm sorry, it's not possible. He's deaf, I said. Like the Sister. He can't help it. I don't even know who he is. I picked him up. A deaf tourist. His pal left him in the lurch. All right, all right. I have to know who he is. Don't tell them that you know me. This isn't a hotel for tourists. What did he say? It isn't possible. Explain it to him. OK, but only for two nights. I'm sure you'll need the slate. Well? What's up with him? - He's deaf. Like Sister Antonia. There's something fishy. He's from the east, from Lithuania. He says it's rotten there, especially for someone like him. What's happened to the other chap? I don't know either. Why not? I'm interested. What's the matter with you? It's too much for you. The work, going into town every day. You have to sleep at night. Come with me? What are you gawping at, stupid Russian? Hey! He can't hear, is as deaf as a post. Shut up! Don't get worked up! Stop boozing! - We can talk it over. Are you telling me what to do? We can... This was the last time, Egli! You see? Thank you. Why are you here? Are you in difficulty? What? Have you got problems? I have to work now. We can talk later. When? Not here. When I've finished work, outside. I'll wait at the big square. I'll see you leaving. I can't miss you in these clothes. Shall we go for a little walk? Why are you here? You're inquisitive. A little bit maybe... Why are you alone? My brother has travelled on. I have never travelled. I travel a lot. Tell me about it. It's difficult. I don't understand all your gestures. Some are the same, others are different. How can you manage on your own? I'm not alone, I'm waiting for my brother Has something happened to him? Is he in trouble? I liked that very much. Do you earn money with it? Everybody in my school could do that. You start with that in a circus school. A theatre. With deaf people. You know it? Are you going? Maybe. I'd like to. Do you want to go for a swim? I can't, unfortunately. Don't be embarrassed because of me. Shall I get undressed? Can't you swim? No... no! I must go back. One more question. Can I trust Sandro? Sandro, the boy in the men's home? I think so. Why do you ask me? You are a woman of God. You mustn't lie. She'll be surprised yet, the new one! It'll soon be the end of her Sacred Heart smile. In my days, we'd have told her to consider it carefully. We all feel a longing sometime, but to bear it, that's what counts. I know it... and you know it... but does the new one know it? I made an exception. Make him understand. You can't stay here anymore. I'll go the day after tomorrow. No. I'm sorry. No. Shit! Fucking bastard! Just you wait, bastard! It was him. Shit, that's mine! I didn't notice. Just what I thought, bastard! A Lithuanian! What are you doing here? Making money? Say something! Well then, what's up all of a sudden? What's the matter? Doctor? Thank you. Hello, who's there? No problem. What you want? You go home? Problem. You help? Okay. My brother... prison maybe. You know where... prison? Yes. Where did you pick him up? In the men's home. You'll end up like your Uncle Fritz with his nuns. You want to help all the poor devils. Fritz is OK. At home I only have to look at the old man and he... It's the easiest way until I've finished my apprenticeship, and as long as I'm with him, nobody can touch me! They will put him... on a plane... for sure... very soon. Okay? - Okay. Let's go. The best thing is if you beat it. Home. The police will sooner or later... The police... you... prison. Police pay... If you think so. Help... one thing. One more time. And that's it. Ticket where? Do you want to go there? Me... Antonia... theatre. Nobody will believe me. She'll never go to the theatre with you. Was the boy able to help you? And who paid? I did. You have money? Then why do you sleep in the men's home? It's cheap and I'm economical. And now? Will you travel on? Soon. I'm having a few days rest. Switzerland is nice. You said that nuns weren't allowed to lie... but other people shouldn't lie either. Do you like being a woman of God? Yes, I actually do. I think you look like an angel in that habit... my guardian angel. You probably need one! Weren't you at the deaf people's theatre? Were you there? I wanted to... now that you've helped me a second time, here's a present. But that was yesterday. No. Later, in Lucerne. It won't work. Nuns can't go to the theatre at night. It's impossible. Then go with another nun. It's very kind of you, but it's impossible. What will you do now? I'll go back. I'm really sorry. I just wanted to thank you. I must go now. What happened? Why have you come back later? I'm tired, I walked slower. We were worried. Silvia will soon be taking her vows. Then she can take on your work and you can stay here. What's in it? Caraway? Taste it. Try it! It's revolting. Why did you put caraway in it? What's the matter with you? What will you do if I don't come with you? I'll get on the train, no matter what. Don't worry. There'll still be a train to get back. Are you going to change your mind? There's another one in an hour. I was born deaf, weren't you? When I was fiifteen I had an illness that made me deaf. I can talk, but I don't like to. What happened after that? I could stay at the circus school. And I became an artiste. No girlfriend, no wife? Did you enjoy the theatre? Look. The theatre troupe is from here. It's a university with all kinds of courses for deaf people, including a theatre. They are all deaf. You could go there. I don't understand it. It's in German. I'd like to learn sign language better. Why don't you go there? I may want to go there one day. You could go there. Or why don't we go together? How do you earn your living? Will you get into trouble at the convent? Did you tell them? What do you think? Why did you come? Because of me? Do you think I can't kiss because I'm a nun? Photo? 10 francs. What happened? It was wrong. From the beginning. It was all wrong. Why's the child here, for God's sake? You look tired. I'll take her back to the convent. There she might tell us all about it. What if she refuses? She might have felt alone. Let's go. The work can't be the cause of it. We shouldn't have sent her to work. You know that it isn't a sin to disobey the rules of the convent. But if you live with us, you have to obey the rules. That's the only way to be chosen by God. It's your own choice to live the life of a bride of Jesus. Forget what there was outside. Think about what it was like in here, it can be like that again. This is the only way that leads to happiness. This is the only way we can stay together Pray and confess. Go away! You have no business to be here. Have you thought it over? Yes. No. I wanted to see you again. You have to decide now, or it will come to nothing. Please stop stealing. It's easy for you to say, you who hide away in a convent. No, I'm here. I'm not hiding. What shall I do then to earn money? Go to the theatre, back to the circus. We two, like in paradise. You don't know anything about paradise. With you I know more about it. Maybe. You know more about life. What's better? Life in paradise or paradise in life. Like this... both at the same time. Is anybody there? Hello! Is anybody in there? Get out! Get out! Okay, perfect, perfect. Clear out immediately! Ten minutes, ten minutes. Then you'll leave! What are you gawping at? What was that? You must have made too much noise. I know what it's like. If only everybody was deaf. Whatever. We have to leave anyway. To start with, you'll need other clothes. What will become of me? We'll find a solution. But what? How? You take it for a while. Where did you get all that money from? It's mine. Did you steal all that? If it's stolen money, I don't want any. Why? It's immoral! Moral? That's different. You're right. That's different. I'll find you. Bastard! Police! Stop thief! Get him! He's a thief! Hello, headquarters... hello! A police boat, quick! A man escaping in the water. Limmat, level with Gemusebrucke. Come along. Did you know this man? Can I help you? A Lithuanian... oh well. We can phone this convent, can't we? Landolt speaking, Zurich police station. Yes. We have a lady here who... What happened? Why did you go away again? Where were you? Sister Antonia... what a pity. What are you doing? It's... This is where you found your life. Life outside isn't for you. Nobody will help you. I can live on my own. Then go! Go! Antonia, don't go away! Shall I put it in? Tomorrow? Well then, have a good journey. Write to me. Aren't you afraid? Afraid? Take care and give my regards to Fritz. This is Antonia from Switzerland. She's new. She'll watch us today. If she likes it, she'll work with us next time. This is Antonia's story, as far as it concerns our order. How I knew her, what I learnt from her letters and what Fritz, Sandro and the others told me. And also partly how I imagine her to be, how things could have been. Some things of course remained a secret. Antonia decided to leave. Sometimes I'd like to be near her to learn more about it.
