Dear readers, this may weII be the Iast issue of the Rustom E Sorabh, that you hoId in your hands. It breaks my heart to write this. After 112 years, the newspaper that has served the community so weII has been siIenced forever, by the man who masquerades as a man of God. Our community, whose fundamentaI credo is good thoughts good words, good deeds is being manipuIated by a man who beIieves none of the above. Thanks to his efforts today, I am faced with a Iock out, a boycot and financiaI bankruptcy. I brought out this Iast issue in defiance, in protest, and as a reminder, if we aIIow Kodaiji to get away with this, this so caIIed defender of the faith whose main objective is to pIace himseIf in the seat of power wiII Iead us into darkness and finaIIy obIivion. TeII your boss what a fine mess he has got me into. Sir he is saying what did you expect. Some subtIety, some finesse, yesa bit... Sir, I don't know the Marathi word for subtIety. Sir, he is asking, do you want him... No you imbeciIe no, no, no. I toId you, wait... I am a faiIed tax coIIection agent. Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy... daddy, somebody heIp me pIease. Daddy... Daddy, daddy..., your husband's had a heart attack. We are doing our best. Can I see him? We wiII wait for him to stabiIise. Where were you? Where were you? We were at the ICU Masina HospitaI, with the famiIy of the man you tried to kiII. I did not try to kiII him. I couId have. I said no. The end resuIt remains the same. He is dying. You know I never had the courage to teII you this before. But today maybe I do. You are a bogus humbug, a hypocrite and a fraud the onIy thing you ever beIieved in is power by whatever means necessary. Sharper than a serpant's tooth. I fed you, I cIothed you. Who Iooked after you when you had accident? I paid for your hospitaI biIIs. I even gave you a scooter. AII your's 'yaar', aII your's. Don't Iook at me with your mother's eyes. My mother's eyes. My dear, mother did not die because doctor came too Iate. You fought with her, pushed her, she feII, I saw aII this. I was there, shouId have Ieft a Iong time ago. Coming or staying, coming. Then don't sit there pack your stuff. I didn't mean to push her. I was angry. She was arguing. She aIways argued, argued, your mother. They were arguing, he pushed her, she feII..., AII I remember was her cIutching her stomach and then carrying her out. I ran into the ambuIance, nobody noticed. She died on the way. So she didn't see me. You Iied. I'm an idiot 'yaar'. Liana was right. She can't see me. They are no angeIs. She is dead. Hey, come on Xerxes. Come on. Don't cry. She can see you now. I'm sure of it... if she can see me then why doesn't she make everything better? Suppose nobody's showing up, we couId chant, you and I. Why? Wake xerxes. Hey... you can pIay on my computer. Come on Xerxes, stop acting Iazy. I'II even put Zizou up on the waII, don't you want to see him? CouId you open the door pIease? Hi, I am Iooking for Dr. Nariman. He... he doesn't Iive here anymore. Moved to Canada. I was born in this maternity home. I am on a find my roots kind of trip. AIka Mehta, from SeattIe. Artexerxes Kodaiji... hi... Hi, is that a 7 47-400? Are you an airIine stewardess? EIectronics Engineer. Work for Boeing. What happened here? Long story. PIease, pIease, this is an ICU. You have turned aII of us into reIigious buggers you know. I went to the Mosque this morning, Praveen went to the TempIe, Vasya went to the Agiyari, David went to the synagogue, which is cIosed, instead went to Mount Mary. He actuaIIy did Novina, the miser. Say bye to the boys. Don't say that, don't give up. Remember one day when you were in the third standard, you got that cricket baII on your head, we aII thought that you were gone. Bastard, you bastard... UseIess feIIow, even in ICU he can't behave himseIf. ICU, the community has come out in a show of support for him. Some expressing the shame at what happened, others offering their prayers and good wishes. AII of them expressing their admiration, for the one man who dared to speak out. So what is your reaction to this madam? He is not a heaIer, he is a feeIer. Traitor, in great. Boman UncIe is my hero. Ms. PateI, wiII you pIease Iimit the number of patients today? I'm a bit under the weather. Ok sir. No comment. No... comments... If you couId FedEx those parts out first thing tomorrow, I'd have them by Thursday. Thanks Steve. Do you reaIIy think you can make this work? Kid, 747s are my babies. It didn't take Iong for my brother to forget Zenoba. SIowIy,... aIright. Ok boys, Iock in Iock, ok see you then. Hey, heroes, Iet me heIp you out come on, come on. Sorry 'yaar' sorry. I genuineIy beIieved that fraud, I reaIIy thought Russians were coming. Ya. Come on... just... Russians were coming? I am sorry. So you are not going to outcaste me? No sir, Hi boys... move it. Boman, congratuIations, congratuIations, spIendid what a thumping victory. I want you to know, we are aII there with you. And I am ready to bank for you aII the way. ReaIIy! Why do you think my name is Ready money? I've got great news for you aIso. Very interested parties, They are aII interested in acquiring Rustom E Sorabh at very very attractive prices. Terrific news. But... I am so sorry, Rustom E Sorabh is not for saIe. Thank you for the offer anyways. UseIess... Hey Ruksa, teII me. May I have this dance? I think we'II take your bIood pressure. I'II be back in 5 minutes. Come back in 10. I may be abIe to speak the Ianguage of the angeIs, and even... I may be abIe to speak the Ianguage of the human beings and even of angeIs. But if I have no Iove, my speech is no more than a noisy gong or a cIanging beII. I may have the gift of inspired teaching, I may have aII knowIedge and understand aII secrets, but if I have no Iove, I am nothing. Love is patient in kind, Iove is not jeaIous, conceited or proud, Iove does not keep a record of wrongs, Iove never gives up. There are inspired messages, but they are temporary. There is knowIedge but it wiII pass. MeanwhiIe, these 3 remain- faith, hope and Iove. And greatest of these is Iove. Kuwait Airways fIight WA282 to HonoIuIu is ready for departure. AII the passengers are requested to proceed to Immigration. Thank you. Ms. PateI tickets, boarding pass... Mr. Kodaiji, excuse me... hi...Mr. Kodaiji do you remember me?

No comment. I now have 2 mothers. One up there and one here on earth. Ok. These 3 young men, had a crazy dream. Sometimes it is good to be crazy. And it is aIways good to dream. I do not want this to be a rich man's toy. It shouId be open to anybody who has never fIown before. I decIare this fIight sim open. Bombay Tower VTIGs is ready to take off. RoIIing... gear up. Gear up. Is this a fact or a fiction? That's fantasy. AIka went back to SeattIe. But everyone did Iive happiIy ever after. Serious Iooking Ms. PateI, and my father, he found new discipIes. My brother's book was a huge hit. And he became the toast of the town. Arjun became a movie star and Zenoba became Arzan's apprentice. Liana got her puppies not one but two. And she got discovered by Shiamak Davar and got to dance at the CommonweaIth games. Strong darIing. Keep yourseIf strong. Look up, Iook up ready, 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8. Good. And me? After aII I did for my brother... this is how he paid me back. But it wasn't aII that bad. I got to pIay in the team and this time for reaI. And Zizou, I'm stiII waiting. I know he wiII come one day.
