Fuck. Hello? Hello? Is anyone receiving this? Hello? Hello? Is anyone receiving this? - Hello? - I'm trapped. - I-- I can't hear you. -Hello? -I don't know what to do. But listen to me. Where are you? A barn. An old hayloft. Okay. And it's below you. Yeah. You said you're in an old barn? A hayloft. So, there's got to be a hay door somewhere. - Yeah. - Okay, listen to me. -You're gonna have to jump. -Wha-- Or you're going to have to wait until sunrise -and just hope that it gets-- -Wha-- wait. I can't hear it. I can't. Not sure if you're still out there. But if you are... ...thank you. Oh, my God! You're alive. You made it. Yeah. God, for a minute there I thought I actually lost you. Well, no idea how, but... -I'm still here. -It doesn't matter how. It just matters that you're here. You know, it would just be my luck, really. I finally hear another human's voice for the first time in what feels like forever. Someone that isn't part of a cult, or trying to kill me. Only for you to be eaten by the morning. Thanks. So, how long have you been out here? For as long as I can remember, really. But how have you survived for so long on your own? I live in this yurt thing. I mean, I don't really venture too far from that. Most importantly, I never attract any unwanted attention. A what? A yurt? Yeah, like, it's an old camping thing. To be honest, it's pretty quiet out here. So, your whole plan is just to live your life in a yurt? Well no, I've just not had a reason to leave, given all the crazies and the creatures out there. What's your plan? Not sure I've got one, really. Barn's trashed. I can't stay there, so... So where to? We're aiming for Leviathan's Peak. My granddad used to take us there in summer. Just going to put our backs to water and work from there. We? Who's we? Sorry, I... I meant me. I'm aiming for Leviathan's Peak. Well, we could be us. I could join you. I mean, I know the peak. It's a few days' walk from here. Plus, it's not much of a life alone, living in this yurt. Now I know that you're out there at least. Don't take this the wrong way, but... How do I know you're not some crazy lunatic? Well, you don't. But maybe that's what you need. A little crazy to survive. Well, if I said no, you'd probably come anyway. So, the peak... it's a few days away, right? Yeah. Okay. The peak it is. We're gonna have so much fun. The word "fun" means something completely different to you, - doesn't it? - Maybe. Right, okay. We should set some ground rules. Ground rules? Yeah, ground rules. Trust me. Sure. Our radio mics, walkie-talkies, whatever you want to call them-- they're battery operated and they're going to die. So we can only turn them on to check in three times a day. 9:00 AM, 1:00 PM and 9:00 PM. That makes sense. Are you sure you want to do this? Honestly... I've been alone out here longer than I care to remember. I've been waiting for a reason to just get up, and, you know, give life another shot. If I don't take that opportunity, then I might not get another. Plus, I've been riding my luck with this place. Eventually, those crazies or the monsters are going to find me here, so... now seems as good a time as any. It's settled. Yeah, it is. Should we check back in at 1? Check back in at 1. By the way... I'm Tommy. Blair. It's good to meet you, Tommy. Nope. Hello? Hey. Is everything all right? Yeah. As well as it can be, I guess. Stark lack of food, but... I'm holding up. Now, how long has it been since you've eaten anything? A decent meal? I can't remember. What, your food searches haven't turned up anything? I haven't found anywhere worth searching for. It's all pretty bleak. You've gotta try something. Homes are worth a look, if you're nearby any, 'cause they're stocked with food just waiting their sell-by date. The opportunity is there. You've just got to take it. It just feels so weird, searching through a family's home. It's a ghost town, Tommy. We're all that's left. Well, us and the crazies and monsters. You've got to survive, just... ...try it. Remember, though, just don't go making any noise, or smashing windows or doors, 'cause we don't want you catching the attention of a potential disaster. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right. Yeah. So, if we make it through this... where would your dream destination be? Good question. Anywhere in the world. New York. New York? Yeah. I guess it started when I was a kid. Um, I grew up watching American sitcoms and stuff like that, and, um... ever since then, I just dreamed of going to America. My mom, um... she always really loved big cities. So, when my dad left, we always said that once we had enough money, we'd start fresh in New York. And from there, it became a dream. I guess it just stuck. But aside from an old photo, I mean, that dream is all that remains of her. You know, I've-- I've got memories, I just haven't got anything solid. The idea of that fresh start, you know, was... was part of our relationship, really, it was part of our promise. So, anyway, what's your story? Not much to share. I was nobody special. Just an easy life, I guess. It was actually pretty good when I think about it. I guess I didn't realize how lucky I was until everything started to fade. But like my dad and my granddad said... "It's all memories and experiences who shape who we are." They wouldn't want to see me fall on my knees. Yeah, I like that. It's amazing how everything can just... vanish in the blink of an eye. So, now you know about the photo I carry of my mum, like some lost treasure. You've got anything cool like that? I have a necklace that my dad gave to me. I hold that pretty close to my heart. Sounds like the perfect reminder of a time before all this. You know, saying that, I don't think I even remember what the world used to be like before this. I was so close to giving up. One last reminder of the thing I need to do. One last thing? My dad passed me down the necklace when my granddad died. It was all so sudden, and way before this happened. I never got to say goodbye, and they scattered his ashes at sea. So, given we make it through this, I want to make it to the sea one last time... for the goodbye that we never had. It sounds stupid, right? Of course it's not stupid. We'll make it through this, Tommy, I know we will. A fading photo and an old necklace. My granddad used to say... "When everything seems so dark, it's the little things that shine through." It's the things we take for granted that keeps us going. Right, well, we have to turn them off again for a few hours. Um... you should try and get some food before nightfall, 'cause it's getting pretty dark, so... we'll check back in at 9, okay? Talk soon. Much good these did the world. You were warned. All of you. But no one listened. And now, you burn. I knew I'd come across one of you nuts, eventually. You will never learn. This is why you're being punished. This is why your loved ones died. Listen, I haven't got time for this, all right? Your stories or your fucking reasons. But if-- it's a big fucking if-- your god was real, whatever god that is you now serve, I don't believe they are the complete fucking prick you make them out to be. And if they are, fuck them! What, you're telling me that all of this is 'cause we didn't serve or stroke their ego enough? Again, fuck them. I don't need their love or permission to go out there and survive a situation you say they caused. You survived the first, and now, you walk with monsters. But you'll know the end is upon us, when the sky burns, and the ancient beasts awake! The seven trumpets will fill the air! The Faceless God will rise. Blair. Blair, please, be there. Blair, just answer. Please, Blair. Tommy? It did nothing. It was toying with me. It could have killed me, but it didn't. I'm not even worth killing. My Dad... my little sister... my brother... ...attacked... just like I was, digging for food. Tommy, I'm so sorry. I-- I didn't know. Carl and Ellie were first. My dad tried to save them, but... it all happened so fast. He knew we wouldn't all get out. He pushed them out the door. He locked them in... before I could go back to help, that's when I heard his cry. I knew it was too late. It all fell silent and... I knew they were gone. And what did I do? Run. They didn't run, Blair. They died saving me. For what? What do I possibly have to live for? I'm just the last grain of sand in an hourglass, waiting to drop. Me. You have me to live for, okay? It's me and you now. You can either choose to give up and leave me alone out here, or we can see this through together. I never had the pleasure of meeting them, but I bet my life that they wouldn't want to see you quit. Not now. Yeah, it's hard. Seems impossible at times, we have to keep going. 'Cause you're a survivor, Tommy, I know you're a survivor. You wouldn't have made it this far if you weren't. We wouldn't have made it this far. So you can't give up, 'cause I won't let you. We can do this, Tommy, we have to. Okay? Just get some rest, recharge, and we'll start fresh, come sunrise. We're nearly there. Tommy. Just remember to turn off your mic, before you go to sleep, okay? My guess is, we haven't got long till these batteries give in, and I'm not sick of talking to you just yet. Blair. Yeah? Thank you. Tommy? You okay? Tommy, I-- What's up? You sound... God, it's a mess. It just doesn't make any sense. I've never seen one of them attack in the day before. Blair, you're not making much sense. The night that we first made contact, the creature that attacked you was smarter than any of the others I'd ever encountered. And this morning, I was attacked in the day. Blair, I'm not following you. They're adapting. So, what now? How long till you hit the peak? A day. A day and a half, maybe. Okay, keep going, but just... stay alert, yeah? Yeah, I just got a really bad feeling about all of this. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse. Yeah. You and me both. Ask me a question, Tommy. A-- anything, just ask me anything, I-- I think we could both do with a distraction right about now, don't you? I never really asked you what you missed from the old world. And I'm not talking about friends or family. I mean stupid shit. Like Netflix and YouTube. I guess I did watch a lot of YouTube. Don't judge me, but I used to love watching all those paranormal shows. You mean the shows that were completely fake? They were not fake. A guy in a muscle top and a fresh trim trying to start a fight with a ghost. Good times. Well, you clearly didn't watch the same shows that I used to watch, 'cause the evidence that I saw speaks for itself. What, you mean the voices of a spirit you could hardly hear? I could only make it out when they put subtitles on the screen. I think that's called "implying the evidence." God, you are so full of it. All right then, Mr. Non-believer, what was your silly little vice? I guess it's only fair. I was a little addicted to reality shows. I think I just heard your jaw hit the floor. You were laughing at me for liking paranormal shows. I mean, seriously. Oh, my God, Tommy, you do realize that they're all fake, all right? You mean like, a guy trying to hit an apparition? No, not like-- all right, you know what? I'm not even going to entertain that comment. I mean, come on, Tommy. There's a reason why award shows stopped calling them "reality shows" and started calling them "reality scripted television." And what even the hell is that anyway? That's just television, right? It made for good entertainment, at least. Good telly while it lasted. Oh, absolutely. I'm sure people watching other people watching television was the reason the whole world went to shit. God. That'd be one sad history lesson. I did love the drama, though. Yeah, I bet you did. Right. I think that will do until our next call. That was a good chat. Thanks. Um, just be safe, yeah? Keep your eyes peeled now more than ever. Blair. Do you think we're going to make it? Yeah, Tommy, we will. We have to. Check back in at 1, yeah? Yeah. You stay safe, Tommy. Okay? You too, Blair. Hand over the bag. This isn't hard. I just want what's in that bag and I'll be on my way. Please, just hand over the bag. I'm sorry, I can't. I really don't want to hurt you. It doesn't have to be like this. I'm hungry. I'm tired. I'm tired of searching. All I want is the bag. Please just-- just hand it over. I'm sorry. I had a brother. You remind me of him. A long time ago now. It's been a long time since I've seen anyone. I just thought... I may never see anyone ever again. Almost forgot what people looked like. It gets lonely. You know. Then you don't care so much for people anymore. It's all about survival. That's what this is. I don't want to hurt you. It's just survival. -What happened to your brother? -You don't get to ask that! It wasn't my fault! Hand it over and walk away. I said I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It didn't have to come to this! Blair, I'm so sorry I'm late. I was being chased by a drifter. She's to be fair. Blair? Blair? Are you there? Blair, you okay? Eat up. You need the energy. It isn't much, but it's something. You're hungry? Who are you? Just an old farmer. Does an old farmer have a name? James. I'm Blair. Blair. You're lucky I found you when I did. Those beasts are not to be messed with. Yeah, I'm extremely lucky. But why did you risk your life to save mine? Most people wouldn't be so kind. Not the people I've met. It was the right thing to do. Drink up before it gets cold. Be careful with that. The whole place could go up. It looks like a really nice place to live. Your home and the surroundings. It's really beautiful. Thank you. It must make you really happy, living in such a beautiful place during all of this. Do you live here alone? For the past few months, yes. Before that, I lived here with my wife. I'm sorry. Did she, um-- she passed before or after? After. I'm sorry. She's at peace now. And I take some comfort in that. There is comfort in that. Will you excuse me? Tommy, you there? Blair? Blair, I'm here. Where have you been? I was attacked. This time I nearly didn't make it. An old farmer saved me. Yeah, if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have survived this one. An old farmer? Can you trust him? You know what some of these people have become. It was only earlier today I met a drifter. They were far more worse than the creatures I've seen out here. We can trust him. And he could have let me die, but he chose to save me. I think he even got hurt. brought me back here and he let me rest and he fed me. I don't know why he chose to save me, but... I know he's got a good heart. His eyes are kind. It's the same look, actually, that I used to see in my mum's eyes. Tommy, if we make it through this, we should aim for an old farmhouse like this one. One that hasn't burned in this plague. We could rebuild there. That sounds nice. I never told anyone what happened to my mum. Um... but if I don't make it through this, I want someone else to know that she went out swinging. Um, we were fighting for survival, just like everyone else was at the time. We were jumping from one hideout to the other. And one day, we woke to the sound of one of those things trying to break through this barricade that we'd created. And eventually, it started to break through. And... and she-- she held it off best that she could. She kept telling me to escape. She kept yelling at me to climb out this little window in the back. And I panicked. I ran and I ran, but I couldn't leave her. I had to go back. I looked back through the window and I could see she was holding it off with everything that she had. That... ...that amazing kindness in her eyes, I could see it was fading. Um... she caught a glimpse of me through the window. And she was-- she was half mad I was still there. She was half begging me to just end it for her. I took out the gun that she gave me. And I checked the chamber and there was one bullet left. And I pointed the gun at her. And she just looked back at me and she smiled. And I pulled the trigger and I-- You did everything you could, Blair. God, I wish that were true. I'll be leaving soon, so... if our batteries don't die, we'll just check back in again in a few hours, okay? After today, I don't want to wait till the morning. Should we say midnight? Midnight. Hang in there, Blair. A kid should never have to see such a thing. Let alone do what you did. No one should ever have to do what I did. It's a feeling no one should ever know. I know that feeling. I've lived with it every day for the past few months. I tried to save her. But it was... I wasn't fast enough. I have never known such pain like that. She was strong. She survived the attack. Watching the person you love more than anything else in the world fade away. Knowing there is... there's nothing you can do. Knowing they'll no longer be by your side. I failed her. And every day since then, it has... it's eaten away at me, like a disease. Living in this house... seeing the hole in the wall where one of those things crawled through. It's an image I'll never forget. But I couldn't leave this house. This farm was our world. Our everything. And I suppose... that's why I needed... to save you. Save someone. Anyone. I owe that to her. I can't leave this world without paying that debt. Thank you. I've refilled your water bottles and packed as much food as your bag can take. No, I can't take this. I have enough to see me through. Head north. Back onto the path by the tracks where I found you. And keep your eyes and ears open for any more of those creatures. Find your friend. And if you ever need shelter... The door is always open. Thank you. Tommy, are you there? Come on, right about now is when you're supposed to reply to me. Oh, for Christ's sake, where are you? Tomorrow morning, Tommy. Okay? Look, my battery is about to die, so this is it, okay? This is the last one. Tomorrow morning, Tommy, okay? Please be there. Fuck. Damn, that door was stuck. Blair? Tommy! Oh, my God. We made it. We made it! I guess we did. Oh, my God. I forgot how beautiful this place really is. You know, in a strange way, you look exactly how I pictured you would. It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Tommy. Pleasure is all mine, Blair. I wouldn't be here, if it wasn't for you. Right back at you. -This could work, right? -I think it just might. Unless you happen to know of an untouched corner of the Earth where life is thriving. Or a safe haven. Better yet, somewhere to grab a pizza. Yeah, actually, pizza sounds like a much better idea. I mean, I've seen a few posters and signs looking about, but I'm yet to find one. A safe haven. Or pizza. Safe haven, untouched paradise. I doubt they're really out there. It's just more empty promises to try and stop the panic. The pizza has got to be out there. Surely. Yeah. We made it. We actually fucking made it. Damn right-- I pray that door holds. Now they're running in packs. I told you they're adapting. So now what? Okay. Okay. This is our only way out, okay? We turn on the gas, wait till the door caves, climb out the window in the back, we light those fucks up. Blair, we can't. You don't understand. This is all I have left. Tommy, this isn't them, okay? A small, run-down vacation cabin, right? This is, okay? Your strength, your love and your compassion they live on inside you. Tommy, this is it. This is the moment. Come on. You can do it. Oh, fuck, it worked. Let's take tomorrow off. That sounds like a great idea. What in the fuck was that? It's the seven trumpets. Well... Fuck.
