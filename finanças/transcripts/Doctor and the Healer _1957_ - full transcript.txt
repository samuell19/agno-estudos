.... No longer escorted by guards? - Pardon me? - You internees. Apparently they trust you. I'm not an internee. - Then why are you going to Pianetta? I'm the municipal doctor. - Oh, yeah? Excuse my curiosity. Why is this place called Pianetta [plain], if it's on a mountain? It was once in the plain, then the devil hit it and pushed it up. Y'know, as devils do. Can't you speak politely? - Politely? What're you, a lady? Who are they? Where are they going? To Don Antonio's. - Who is Don Antonio? - What? You don't know His Excellency Don Antonio? Don Antonio, the great magician! The great healer! THE DOCTOR AND THE HEALER Stop there! Do you have faith? - Yes! Do you have pure souls? - Yes! What else you have? - Four cheeses for Don Antonio! Me, two chickens. - A jug of olive oil and ham. Me, new wine. - New wine... First ones first. No, give them to me. You must go to him with empty hands. The Maestro would be offended. Well, go! Get in cleansed! Go on! Let's not waste time! My respects. - Good morning. We are the Micciche family. - I don't want to know that. Have a seat. We are relatives of Salvatore. - I don't want to know that. What is it? - Look. She used to be white and red, now she's white and green. I say it's envy! Don't talk. You feel weak? - Very. Sit here. Let's get enlightened. Eye and evil eye, I've read into her eye. Infamy of envy. Oh, it's envy! - It's Concetta! That snake! Don't say names. Have faith, and I'll give you an infallible remedy. Vine blood, and blood of equine male. Clear? Not quite! Red wine, horse steaks, raw and minced... garlic, an egg yolk, and lemon juice. Meatloaf! Moreover she'll wear, at her neck, the beneficial scapular: Ear of wheat, rue leaf, tooth of dog. Clamide! I'll have my niece prepare the scapular on purpose... as in such cases it takes virginal hands, pure hands that don't know the temptation of flesh. Take your cap off! Clamide! - My God! My uncle! Wait a minute. When will I see you? - I don't know. Bye. Clamide! Clamide! Envy. A thousand apiece. - But I brought two chickens! I don't want to know that. Catch me if you can! I wanna talk with Don Antonio! Come here... - Let me go, go away! If I see you here again you're done for! - Catch me if you're good! Hey, hey, what's this? - He got in by violence! Well, let him be. What is it? - I wanna tell you something important. Let's hear. - What'll you give me? But last time you stripped my home! I gave you a pocketknife, and a whistle... The knife got rusty, and the whistle lost the seed and is winded. OK, here's fifty lire. Go on, out with the news. The municipal doctor arrived. - Ah! And where is he? He went to city hall. The mayor's not there, there's just grandpa And that's it. So what? The house keys of the doctor can't be found. They're looking for it and I came to tell ya. But I want a cigar too. A cigar? Who taught that? - Grandpa. Grandpa taught you to smoke cigars? No, he taught me to get 'em as a tip. So he can smoke them. So then? But what could they do with the keys? Eh, we can't find them. And the treasurer is not in! But we'll fix that right away. Come along. Listen... - Yes? - But... Ah, yes, yes, right. There it is, see? Put 'em down. And now help me get up here. Yes, yes, but not so much. Push. Push! Push... How will I straighten up now? Doctor! Come! All done, did you see? Come on, come on, come on. Here it is. Well, when there will be here the examination table, the drug cabinet... it'll be a perfect doctor's office. - Oh, sure! For me can go. - For me too! No, you can go. - Who? You, you, you... - Oh, yes, yes! Er... thanks. No, I can't accept cash, I'm a public employee. If you have a cigar... - No! Smoke, never. - Never? Then give me the money. So long. 25th June. Arrived well at 4pm. Curious village, to be studied. Taken possession of office. Lots of things to be fixed. Rustic dwelling, but in good condition. What're you doing? - A sun stroke, but he's better now. But the candle? - Don Antonio told me to. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Yes! Yes! I'm coming! Stay calm! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! - Yes, yes, here I am. Good morning. - What's happened? Nothing. Sorry, then what do you want? The town hall. - This is a clinic, not a town hall. No, town hall sent me, for the cleaning. I already know it's a clinic. What time is it? What time is it? - 5:45. 5:45am? I'm late on my the first day. But tomorrow I'll come earlier.- No, no. Listen. I'll give you a key, it's better. At what time is the mayor in his office? Almost never. You know I thought you older? What? - I thought you older. No, no, I mean where can I speak to the mayor? At home. But he's about to leave. What? At night he's away and at 5:45, he's... Eh, lucky him! He's got the wine, trades, always on the go. Why? You think it's too early? Say, what's your name? - Pasqua. Good. If anyone comes, ask them to wait. I'll be right back. What's your name again? - Pasqua [Easter]. Short for Pasqualina. Move it, guys! Or this is the day we'll be late. The market opens at 7! Carluccio! Wake up! The mayor, please? - Yes? Good morning, mayor. - Good morning. No, on the other side! I'm the municipal doctor. - Nice meeting you! On arrival yesterday I sought you... Sorry for yesterday but we got lots... Boys, it's slack! This way we'll lose it all. Gimme a hand please. - Yes, sure. Tie the rope and fix it well, that way. Look, when you have a minute, I... But when I'm through I'll run off, doc! Anyway, what is it? Tell me. It's about the Hygiene Commissioner's orders. The circular for anti-typhus vaccination. You had it, didn't you? I think so. Yes, yes! Well, the equipment is arriving, and I'd start now. Today's the 26th. Whenever you like! Carluccio! He's the city council secretary. Carluccio, the doctor wants to start vaccinating. Tell the crier. Well, bye. It's there? - What? - The... Ah! My sister. Hope she didn't bother you last night. Mafalda! Mafalda! I introduce you the municipal doctor. Finally we've a doctor! - Coming. Dr... Ready! - Dr. Marchetti... Look, your... Ah, thanks. 'Morning, delighted. - Mafalda! The doctor said you bothered him last night with the piano. - No, not quite! Well, anyway, do the honours, I gotta run off, bye. Good day. - Come in! Had your coffee? - Not yet. - Make yourself at home. - Thanks. Sorry for being untidy, they woke me suddenly. Don't worry. Sorry, it's my brother's mess. You can go, Teresa. Blessed who only thinks about sleeping! I, instead, I vigil. Vigil? Yes, until dawn. Oh, sure, insomnia is a widespread ailment, yet... it's also true there are excellent drugs. If you let me... No offense, but you doctors, you're materialists. You see, in some cases, it's the spirit that needs treating. At night, after playing that little song, I sleep very well. Why, you, every night... Yes, it's my and Corrado's song. Your husband? - No, fianc?. I met him at high school, in Salerno. He's in service now, as an officer. Oh, good. What rank? - Well, right now, I wouldn't exactly know. When he was called up, in 1942, he was a sub-lieutenant. Then, he was soon sent to Russia, and since then he no longer sent news. But, I think he'll come back as a captain or major, don't you think? Sorry, maybe I misunderstood. Your fianc? left for Russia in '42? - Yes. And he sent no news since? - No. I see. War is a terrible thing. Also my cousin suffered the same fate. Meaning? We had to resign ourselves to consider him lost. Your cousin, maybe, not Corrado! But... You told me... - Corrado will return. Good day! Good... Teresa! Shoes, bag and salt! Good! No, we ain't got it, this time we don't! Scarafo'! - Order me. - You put in capers? Just three. - You mustn't put them! You know they hurt me, I can't digest them! Arab! You're an Arab! Who are you? I need to talk to you. - It's not visit time, there's a timetable. When there's people... I'm ashamed. Scarafo', get out. It's the third time she comes and goes, goes and comes, comes and goes. Let's hear it. I can't, ain't got the nerve. Have faith. What's happened? Don Anto'... I'll kill myself! Who was it? You understood? - I did, I did... Then it shows! I've grown fat already! My God, it shows! No, it doesn't show. And him? Where is he? In Barletta. At the wine coop. But he won't marry me. Get to the point. What do you want from me? Guess that too. No! I don't want to guess that. Don Anto', come to my aid. If mom and dad come to know... What a shame, Holy Mother! How old are you? - Almost 17, if you will. Get yourself a peach over there. What are you afraid of? Children don't scare, y'know? St. Rosa says so too. They're the best thing in the world. Ah. She didn't make them though. Sure, when a baby is small, it's something annoying. They cry, gotta give 'em the breast. But you're the kind who has much milk, y'know? And then they're always pooping, must be changed at every moment. But when he's one year old, when he starts talking... he says "mama". Hey! It's quite a satisfaction, y'know? - I started at 11 months. - Good! Then I'll give you something that'll make him grow beautiful and robust. Why not something not to make him be born? Look what one gotta hear! Those who've no children would want them. They may even steal them from others! But papa... Mama and papa... I can't! I can't! They'll kick me out of the house! Who knows what happens if they know! Nothing will happen. I'll speak to mom and dad myself, okay? You'll really speak to them? - Yes. Tomorrow. Maybe even today. Today. Today. Thank you, Don Anto'. And may you be blessed. - You, not me. Cheer up, you'll have a nice baby boy. No, I want a female. Males are all wicked. All right, agreed. You'll have a girl. Uncle! Say, that girl who just left, who are her parents? Rosina? She's Quaratino's daughter. You know, that tall, hefty brawler. Then better talk just to the mother. Say, it's quite a while that you look strange. Why? - It's what I'd like to know. Seen what happened to that girl? - No, what? It does not concern you. But remember just one thing: watch out! But what's this about? - I know what! And remember also your poor mama's troubles. What's to do with me? - It has. I wish it hadn't! Anyway keep in mind: besides an uncle, I'm your father, mother and brother! I know. But there's Miss Mafalda awaiting you. And you tell me now! Scarafone! Scarafone? - Master? - The cloak. - Coming! - The comb! Serenity and joy. - Good morning, Don Antonio. Stay seated. Oh, your face is pale. Something upsetting you? Yes, I mean, no. Am I very pale? - No. Do we withdraw? - Yes. It's rather a pallor that embellishes your face's perfect oval. The doctor told me something horrible that upset me. - You deal with that little doctor? Not me, Don Antonio, it's my brother! I don't want to know that. Sit down, relax. - Yes. - You have a headache? Yes, a little. He's a cynic... Calm yourself, calm yourself. - Yes, yes. Relax yourself. Relax, relax. It's over? - No. - There, I knew it. You have a polarized psyche, I don't feel it react. Well! Externalize, it's better. So tell me what he told you, that wannabe doctor. That Corrado is dead. Good heavens! What a thoughtlessness! I'm so angst-driven. Shall we check? Let's check. Let's check... Never seen this photo. You said that if it was never used it's better. - Sure! Sure... There, he was 18. He was in pre-military. He is fine! - Oh, good! In excellent health. - Great! Thanks, Don Antonio! Of course, he's rather far away, eh? But closer than last time. Slightly closer. Oh, good! Thank you, Don Antonio. You know what I've done? I sent to the newspaper a small photo of Corrado. Y'know, those photos with a caption "Seeking news about..." Sure. - Have I done well? - Very well, very well, very well. As long as you're serene and happy, no issue. Thank you, Don Antonio. I wanted to tell you something else. That scoundrel - you know who I mean? - The doctor. He wants to vaccinate everyone for typhus. But I won't go, right? It's sacrosanct! This is the ideal week for Aquarius! Jupiter is in conjunction with Saturn... and the zenith expresses in the cosmos. Be well. - See you soon. Scarafone, escort! - Don't bother, I know the way. How I like her! I don't get you. You like her? Go for it! Yeah, I needed your advice! She's obsessed with Corrado. I should kill Corrado first. - Why? He's alive? What do I know? And if she gets sick over it? I'd lose her weekly 3000 lire, the way it goes. - Which way goes it? Scarafo', you gotta keep up with the events! OK? We've a restless enemy in town! Health vaccinations, stuff, things! This guy will deprive us of our bread! Let's cast an evil spell on him! - Scarafo', do me a favor, get lost! But why? - In 1957 we still deal in spells! I try to help with ideas... - Don't talk nonsense! Attention, attention! By municipal provision... all citizens aged between 10 and 65 years... are obliged to go to the municipal clinic... where Doctor Marchetti will proceed to the vaccination anti-ty... anti-typhus! The clinic will stay open all day and also tomorrow. Go! No! Do not touch the needles. It's clear? You'll be here, where I am, I'll be there, where you are. For each one entering, a swab. A light rubbing at this height, then, a step back... pedal, down the swab. And so on. Careful. Those who enter pass by here. Those who are leaving, by there. This way we avoid confusion. So, to recap: swab, rubbing, back step... Did you see? If we hadn't rehearsed? Therefore, move the bucket. There, like that. All clear? All clear. - Good! Let's start with you. - What? I say... You're not afraid, eh? Come on, what the heck! You know what this is for? Typhus is an infectious disease. Thus, getting vaccinated, beyond being a prudential norm toward ourselves, is a duty toward others. You understand? Good girl! Come here. - If you get close, I'll use this slipper. Hey, have you gone crazy? Come here! -No! It's an order! - Go away! Come here! Come here, I said! Shame on you! Why, at your age... Open this door! Open the door immediately! Yeah, so long! Excuse me? Excuse me? - Please, please, do come in. Shave... A shave, and a nice hair combing. Out! Out of here! I'm not a guy to make fun of! - But why? Today's not Monday. Outside it says "Barber", so shave me. Look there! It's written "Clinic". Clinic! I don't read! I came here, I saw the insect screen at the door, and you in a white apron. I came for a shave, so shave me! Go away! Go, it's better. Hey! Try to touch me and I'll use the knife! Go away, and thank God I respect your age. - You don't scare me! Get that! Hey! I say, are you crazy? Clear off! Leave the doctor alone. - You're right! Shoo! But we'll meet again, y'know! - Scram! Peasants, uncouth people. And excusable, in a certain sense. See, to him you're truly a barber. - What? No, I meant, these people don't even know what a municipal doctor is. We're behind by fifty years, trust me. May I? Yes, of course, be my guest. We're off from the world, doctor. The only big event happened at Pianetta dates back to 1899! When King Umberto passed by here. Sorry. Antonio Locuratolo. - How do you do? - Better known as Don Antonio. Ah! Finally. You'd be the one who treats sunstrokes with candles on the head, eh? I do what I can, doctor. But now that you're here things will go much better, with such a competent physician. - Thanks. What matters, at first, is that the peasants accept being treated by you. Yes, they'll be convinced. Well, in this I may be of use to you. Modestly speaking, I've my clients. I may pass a part to you but later you'll do the same. At times you may pass me your prescriptions, at times I'll tell you how to disguise a scientific cure with the suitable occult guise... that then is all nonsense. Well, a sort of ebb and flow. Look... - Are you of Capricorn? - No, of the shoe. - What sign is that? A sign that you must hurry out of here or I'll kick you. You decline my offer? Grave error. Without me the shop is closed. No one will come. People here don't need you! - But you do, though. Yellow cornea. Liver. Take one of these before each meal. You've a good eye, I'll admit. But you lack the best... The Divination! Keep it. Before this evening you'll need it, I'm telling you. Long as you don't hurt me. - What? The injection. I'll have it. I'll rather go to the police, the chief! Eh, they don't know me yet, here. And you don't know the sargeant. At night he's in Borgonero, at morning in Villanova. He's here only on odd days. So, then, I'll go to the mayor! There's the doctor. - Let him in. But what's his schedule? May I? Good evening. Sorry for... Come in, doc. - Thank you. Meet Mr. Pagliuca, councilor of waters. - How'ya doing. - Tell me. I'm sorry to disturb, but... A drink? - No, thanks. Mr. Mayor, the situation is serious. - What situation? Don't know. What situation? - Not a dog showed up. Not one, y'know? And what's more, I was threatened! By that Don Antonio! Mayor, I have a mandate. We've come up to intimidate a citizen! Thus I'm asking you if there are grounds for filing a report to the police. Are there? - I don't know, one can always try. - Wanna try? But it takes evidence. - Right. What do you say? - Ah! I've said already. - Then it's your say. Well, let's do something, whatever. Don't know. Want to ask Borgonero a truckload of cops so they do a nice house-to-house sweep? Who will ask? - Ah, the doctor, it's not my issue. Let's hurry though. - Actually there's still a month. I won't argue on that. See, ten to eight! Now I'll lose my sleep. I have to be up at 4am tomorrow! Teresa! The alarm clock! So then, do you take this responsibility? No. It would be a false step. I must win the trust of these people, and not... not coerce them. It takes persuasion, conviction, that's what it takes. If you, mayor, and you, councilor, could personally... Mafalda! Mafalda! Mafalda! In God's name! We're talking! A bit of silence! Eh! We're talking! Well? And the doctor? Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Uncle Nicola got a snake bite! They sent me for Don Antonio, but I came for you. He's serious, think what luck! - Yes, let's go. Go away! Go away! Shoo away! Be good, the serum has immediate effect! And I said shoo away! - Stop it, uncle! Pasqua, grab him! - Let go of me! Get off me! Get off me! I don't want an injection! I want Don Antonio! Let go of me! Pasqua, hurry! Come here! Don Antonio won't help! Stop! Run, Pasqua, I'll go around! Away! Go away! I won't have any injection! I want Don Antonio! Give me Don Antonio! - Stop, uncle! - Stop! Stop where you are! No use running, I must give you the serum. - Stop, uncle! Well done! Hey, doctor! Doctor! I congratulate you! Well done! Keep it up! Just what it takes. Persuasion and conviction! You're an hour late! - Hush, it's chaos at home, uncle Antonio is mad as hell. Why? What happened? - I'm hot. The doctor! Someone was bitten by a snake. They call my uncle, instead comes he and gives an injection. Figure that? Gee! Gimme a kiss. - You think nothing but that? Should I think of Uncle Antonio's vipers? I don't like when you're so materialistic. No kiss. If ever, after married. What? But then I go to Uncle Antonio and talk to him. I'll tell him "Dear Sir, I'm in love with your niece. I'm Galeazzo Pesenti..." - ...penniless and jobless. Great! My uncle wants me to make a rich marriage! But really! No kissing, scarce meetings, no talking to uncle Antonio, what kind of life we lead here, damn? How I like you, my big head! My God, they're here! - Who? - Uncle's colleagues, the other healers. They wanna do something against these doctors. If he seeks me... See you tomorrow. - I'm on the guard duty. Always you? Aren't you 18 at the armory? - Yes! But all the others are slackers. Why, guard duty is tiring? One must be alert. If you see a shadow, immediately "Who's there?" The third time you shoot. - Even if it's a person? If he's got an intent, yes. Say... And if that shadow was me... you'd shoot even at me? Eh, yes. - So, you don't love me! - But I've orders to shoot! Well, at a leg, okay. Spadafora's right! Out with cheaters and swindlers. Let's be up to date. And you too... Don Marziale, yes you... - What about me? - Why despise antibiotics so much? Yes. We don't exploit ignorance, like you! Yes! To cure a hernia, you let people astride a donkey, by the river and with an open umbrella! That's old stuff, old! - And you! You! To cure a sciatica you make a patient hold a potato until it sprouts! I won't react. - Oh, you won't? - No. Big liar! Mind your words! - Who d'you think you are? Careful, I'll dazzle you! - No, don't look at me! - I'll dazzle you! Try if you got the guts! Clown! - With my eyes! - Yes, clown! - No, no! Brother healers... - Witch! - ...let's not wander off the point! Old hag! Doctors multiply, the police admonish us, priests contrast us! Let's join forces in the same battle, in order to avoid further humiliation. Well said, Don Antonio! - Great speech! - Bravo! Maestro, they want you. - I'm in conference. It's a girl for a love potion to besot her beloved. Scarafo', you'd be a helper? After 6 years you still don't know how to make a potion? Be of help! Maestro, I didn't dare... - Go on, dare! And don't distress me! You're right. Don Antonio is busy, he entrusted you to me. Actually, I wanted him personally. The potions branch depends on me, Don Antonio gives me free rein. But you make it so he loves me inevitably and immediately? Let's get enlightened. Have faith. You have faith? - Yeah... Who is the object of your desires? - What object? Who is he? - I can't tell. I don't want to know that. Here you go. Juice of flower is heart power. A drop if there's gloom and love will bloom. Take this creek stone. Put it in his bed, close to his heart, which, after eight days, will lose all its pride, and he'll ask you as a bride. You'll have three children, one a blonde girl. Play at the lottery 70, 21 and 28. Have faith and give me a thousand lire. Stop, stop, that's enough. - This is good, it's classy stuff! What are you, a doctor? - Yes, why? Grandpa said he feels bad. He said to go to him. Good boy! And you came to call me. Good little man! But I didn't want to come at all. - Why? Cause I wanted to call Don Antonio, but grandpa said no. Your grandpa is right. Let's go. How much? Altogether, 150. Excuse me! Excuse me! Reverend! - Yes? When will we do this blessed confirmation? - Hopefully Sunday, son. But I have 3 churches to serve. Write to Rome! Let 'em know! In Rome! Mayor, good news. The barrier is cracking, new patients. Best wishes! - Thanks. Let's go. I'll say, he keeps himself busy, eh? - Even too much. What's the time? 12:45. - The newspaper must have arrived.. Mother, how I feel ill, doctor! Tell me, where are these pains exactly located? Here? A little all over. - Earlier you said on the right. On the right too. Something like that. No fever, eh? - No. Hungry? I can't bear to eat anything! My stomach is upset. Nausea. Bring me that soup spoon. - What for? What for? Obey the doctor, do as he said! Rude rascal! Doctor, sorry, pay no heed. Okay, let's see. I feel sick, doctor... - Get! We don't eat soup. We always eat macaroni. No matter, this will do. Open your mouth. - Why? Open it. - What're you doing? - Nothing, be quiet. - What d'you wanna do? Open your mouth, come on! Go away! Leave him alone! Leave him! Lie down! Cut it out, you! Come on, lie down. Keep still! Let go of me, by Jove! - No, no more! What's that, the cinema? Buzz off! Go! That's enough. Where can I wash my hands? - There. Never mind, it doesn't matter. You didn't understand anything, eh? - What do you know? What's wrong, then? Too early to say. Symptoms are contradictory. I need to think. Yeah, see ya! - Hey, will you shut up? You'll see that I too will cure your grandpa, quiet. Take one of these every four hours, remember. I'll be back tomorrow. Goodbye. - Goodbye and thank you. See you. Umbe', what'd he say? He cured you? - He said something, Umbe'? He seems too young. For absolute rest, I mustn't see anyone. Go away, I'm sick! Go away. Vito, close it. Close well. Come here. Quick. On the double! Come here. Listen closely to what I say. What d'you want? - Well... you, now, go to Don Antonio. How's that? First you didn't wanna send me, now you wanna? - Hush! And what I warn you for is: silence with everyone. Everyone! Clear, eh? So, now you go to Don Antonio and tell him this: "Don Anto', the hen has laid the egg!" And I gotta go to Don Antonio for this bull? I'll give you the bull with a slap! Get going! Go do what I said. And come back soon, okay? But which hen laid an egg if we don't even have one? Here is you hen, rascal! Grandpa says I gotta tell you something, but I got nothing to do with it. - Well? As we don't have a hen, and neither the egg. Slow, go slow... The hen didn't lay the egg? Grandpa says it did. - Ah, it did! Yes... But I wanna know which hen laid an egg if we don't even have it? Never mind. What's relevant is that it did. Say, what did the doctor say? - He understood nothing! He's less stupid than I thought. - That's why I wanted to call on you. Right! But this time it's best he came. Go, go. Here's a nice card deck. Are there all? - Count them if you don't trust. What d'you want? I want to talk to Mr. Don Antonio. It's very urgent. Easy! I must report first. - Well, go on! Wait for the okay. - 'Right, hope so. Bighead! What're you up to? You crazy? Hey! Come here! - Soldier! Halt! Do you have faith? - What? Is your soul pure? Quit beating around the bush! Move over, nitpicker! 'Morning. I'm Galeazzo Pesenti... - I don't want to know, I know already. Heart griefs, am I right? - Gosh! What 'gosh'? We're not in barracks, young man! Concentrate. You're from upper Italy? - Yessir. And her relatives... do they know? But shall I tell you myself if you know everything? I came to talk about Clamide because we're engaged. I came to tell you because I'm an honest man. Calm. Gradually. Who are you? In a nutshell, what do you stand for? Well, I'm an honest young man from Bergamo province. Excellent province. But... as to family chapter, as to wealth assets. Ah, no luck, y'know? Even last year my uncle broke his leg and now he can't work anymore. And you work? As a civilian, I mean? - Ah, yessir, I'm a dryer. Dryer. Yes, in the sugar mill. Y'know, when the sugar beets get dried. Sugar beets. Clamide! Clamide! You know this one? - Yes. - Then send him away immediately. - No! Mr Antonio, we're in love. - We're in love, yes, and we want to get married. Scarafone! - Order me! Order me. Throw this one out. Scarafo', don't move. Woe to you! Get inside, wretch! - What're you doing to her? Leave her alone! - Stop or I'll thrash you! Come on, if you got the guts! Drop that pump! - Drop the stone! You don't scare me. Instead you're scaring my suspenders! What time is it? Nearly noon. And I've yet to make the sauce. You're lucky I'm due back today, for a special mess meal. Sure, if it were tomorrow you'd give my mustache a tug! Go, go, go fix your sauce, jerk! Go eat your ration, go! Stuff your belly! Stuff yourself! Clodhopper! - Potato-eater! Sod digger! But I'll be back, mind you. Yes, yes, but first go eat your soup. African! - Polenta-eater! Go to Africa, go! - Sad sack! Clodhopper! Moroccan! - Loo cleaner! Go to hell! - You and your kind! You want me to be fooled by that half-witted good-for-nothing? And don't provoke me! I may blow up him and the entire armory! With one gesture, this way! Scarafo'! Maestro, the tire. Capomile. - Camomile. No, no. Leave it there. He hasn't one symptom in accordance with another! You gotta heal him, there's no other way. Drink, drink, so you get calm. Good. Here people are gossiping, y'know? What for? - Because you haven't cured him yet. Drink! I end up looking bad for defending you. Drink! Look, I'll drink whenever I please! It's late, go home. Good night. Look if with all the worries one has... Pick it up. Must be the local water. It tastes strange. - You feel something? - No, I'm fine! Pick... Go to sleep, 'night. Good night. Come in. Well, what do you want? - Then... I go away? I thought you'd gone! See? Instead I'm still here. Happy? For what? Well, if you needed something... No, no! Good night! Enough now! It's time to sleep! How rude, what a sinister character! Let him be! The poor guy is nervous, and with reason. For three days he's worked in vain with his patient. Why won't you act, Don Antonio? I say, why don't you intervene? - If I'm asked to. I haven't yet shown you something. Here. Nice! - I don't know, but I feel that this photo is like a bell playing far away. And Corrado can hear it. Can we check? Yes, but not with this, it's second-hand. A moment. I have a letter here. Rather, some verses. I never showed them to you. Let's see. - Please, take a seat. Bar... Why not sit on the sofa there? - Sure! Barracks Antonio Balestra, Rocca Palumba... Louder, please. Barracks Antonio Balestra, Rocca Palumba... Slower. With a little feeling. Barracks Antonio Balestra, Rocca Palumba... province of Catania. 4 September, 1942. X, I, X. - No, nineteenth in Roman numerals. XIX, fascist era. - Yeah! It was used then... Mafalda, soft and warm soul. I yearn to hug you, to cling to you, to love you, to feel gripped... See you soon. Victory! Beautiful, isn't it? Excellent metrics, good cadence. Especially the last verse. Feisty guy. - In fact, he left as a volunteer. Eh, yes! A guy, moreover,.. full, full with feeling. Ah, how dear you are! No, squeeze my hand. There's more fluid. - Yes. It barely moves. Put the other hand too, and hold mine tight, tight, tight. It's not moving. Yup. He's wandering away, as if there were interference. Don't know, as if there was a... another person. Another person? Man or woman? Man. A man nearby, very near. Near him? - No, near you. Ah, it must be the doctor! I feel it! I feel he has a nefarious influence on me. There are people like that, eh? - Uh, sure there are! Well, we'd better suspend tonight, as... You think so? - Yes, there's no mood, no climate. So... As to the doctor, I tell you not to worry. He'll soon be packing, and certainly tomorrow we'll all have confirmation. - Good. Are you happy? - Oh, yes. Er, today is due the week. Oh, sorry! I'll be right back. Pasqua! Damn! Pasqua! Pasqua! Pasqua! Pasqua! Pasqua! - Doctor! Doctor! Don Antonio's visiting Umberto! He's going to cure him. The whole town knows! Sisters of man, the elderly, the young... Female rescuers, respect and trust, trust, trust! Trust and perseverance! - Trust and perseverance! Trust and perseverance! Close your eyes. - Shh! He's got to concentrate. Salt. -Salt. It's there. - Salt, strength of mind, body and heart. Salt, salt, salt, evil do rout, the good do exalt. Rout the evil! What? - That's the jar of baking soda! - Open your mouth. Trust and perseverance. Trust and perseverance! Apparently it's soda. Rout, rout... - Rout! Open your mouth. Strength of the body! Uncover. Less, less! There's people? - Many. And still coming. What? - More coming. Don Anto', the money. - Trust and perseverance! I'll give it to you later. You feel pain here? I don't feel any pain! - I don't feel any pain! Go easy, you're hurting me! You are healed! See? And you didn't wanna call him! - Get up, man. Get up and walk! I feel better! I feel really well! You'll drink every night half a glass of water with a spoon of vinegar, where you'll put a pellet of turquoise coral. Pellet. Pellet. Here you go, man. Take care and have faith. Five thousand. Eternal gratitude to Don Antonio! My Savior! Come to the revived brother! Come in! Flock in! But without tiring him. Without tiring him. Applaud Don Antonio. Long live Don Antonio! Don Antonio! - You stink! May the Lord preserve you! Hello, doctor. You want some? I knew you was a barber! Rascals! Cheaters! Bastards! Get that! Bastards! Village of rascals! Swine, swine, swine, swine, swine, swine! Swine! Lousy filthy rascals! All in cahoots! - Holy Mother, what's up? Go away! I don't want to see anyone! All in cahoots! No, not me! - All! You too! I don't want to see anyone! Indeed.. I'll leave. - Want a camomile? - No! Yes, give me one. - It's ready. It's ready. Prefecture of... Mind your own business! It's my resignation. How do you feel? Fine, fine. My God! What did you give me? - Oh,Saint Anna! Nothing, nothing! Blessed Mary, maybe I used too much! Of what? A potion. A potion Don Antonio gave me. Don Antonio? - Yes. So it's him who's poisoned me! I'm sending him to jail! I'm sending him to jail! No, don't be alarmed. Indeed... That's good, good! My God, my God! I got him! He's under my thumb! He ruined himself by his own hands! I'm sending him to jail! My God, my God. Don't you remember what it was? No matter. Doesn't matter, indeed, thank you! My God! I'm sending him to jail! I'm so happy. How happy I am. Then I ran through a vast forest. It was as if the forest had no end. Trees, trees, trees. - Trees. Trees. Dissatisfaction. Anxiety. When, suddenly, you appeared from behind a tree. Me? - Yes. With arms outstretched Open! Let me out! I want to leave! - No! Let's go, it's better. I had to lock her up. If you knew what a rascal! She's fallen in love with a far from laudable bad boy. That's girls nowadays! - So, we were at my arms outstretched... So then, you... it was as if... you wanted to embrace me. So, I... - Maestro. Sorry. Maestro, I disassembled the whole motorbike, and I can't find a missing cotter-pin. So go buy this pin! - A cotter-pin? - Cotter-pin. Sorry, we'd better go in. We're being disturbed here. It was as if I wanted to embrace you, right? And so, you... So I grabbed something, don't know... Something that moved. - Yes? Yes, a sort of... Yes, of frog! And I put it in your mouth. What do you think it means? Nothing good, I think. - No? The frog is always a carrier of bad news. Oh, no, Don Antonio, don't say that! I wanted... I wanted to in fact talk to you... About what? Miss Mafalda. - Yes? I too have received some astral messages. Yes, one, just this morning... rather worrying. - Don Antonio! I struggled, Miss Mafalda, and when this morning I emerged from the trance, I was drenched in sweat, exhausted, annihilated. What happened? Be strong. Miss Mafalda... Yes, I saw him. Far away. Stretched out. Handsome. Immersed in the serene sleep of... No, no, no, no! Come on, you need to accept the situation, Miss Mafalda. Come on... Geez! Have faith! But at least... will he have gone to heaven? Sure! Where else? Yes ma'am! He's there! Rest assured! Come on, be good, have faith. Don't lose heart! You're still young and beautiful! - No! - Yes, instead, come on! Everyone says so. Who? Common... acquaintances. In heaven. - Yes. But you are on earth. And the earth is made to live and love. You've stolen too many years from your happiness! Miss Mafalda... I love you. - Nooo! Rogue! Now I understand! You have lied! Scarafo'! Miss Maf... Scarafone! M... Miss Mafa... Miss Mafalda! Scarafone, she's fainted! - Don Antonio, the cops! What? - Cops. The sergeant is coming with a cop. The doctor has denounced you! - No! - Yes! What did you do? - "Go for it!" See what happened? You killed Corrado? - Yes! Imbecile! Hide, destroy! The baskets! - The baskets. - The baskets! Quick! The sacks! - The sacks. - Sacks and baskets. - Quick, come! Quick, the wax! The wax for the spells. - The wax. The wax! - I'll handle it! The scapulars! - I'll handle it, Maestro! Yes, yes! Come. Come, Scarafo', come! Come, Scarafo'! Scarafo'! Come on! Yes, I'm coming! Give me time at least! - The well! Let's throw it all in the well. Come on, damn. Come to the well. Come. I can't get through, damn! Come! In the well, yes, in the well. Let's throw it all in the well! The cap! - What're you doing, you fool! Imbecile! - My hat fell in! Come, let's go by bike. - Where? First rule, never be found at home. Then we'll see. Let's go. Start it up. Start it up! Let's go! Hurry up! Let's go. Go! Go! - There you go! Nice seeing you! - Sergeant, they were fleeing! Everything's in the well! I spy on them! - What're you saying, wretch? The old man wasn't ill, it was a trick! He's a cheat! So there! - It's true! It's true! He's a despicable being! He deceived me for 15 years! He even put his hands on me. He tried to abuse me! Hey! Have you both gone mad? They're all lies! Sergeant, everyone knows me! I'm an honest man. I'm accused of nasty deeds that I never committed, sergeant. But what potion? Which? What poisoning? I don't even know this girl. Who're you? Is it true? It's true. It was his assistant. - Him?! Mama mia, Scarafone! What have you done? What? - Ah, you're in trouble, you'll end up in jail. What jail? It was a love potion! One moment. One moment! I say, did I get it right? Pasqua, I mean you. - Yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes what? It's not my fault. I fell for him who wouldn't even look at me! - So then? - So... I thought of a potion. But... instead of putting a drop, I put it all. Because he treated me badly! That's out of the blue! - Hold on! "Blue"... They try to involve me in a love tangle! Nonsense! - No, no, we must put it on record! The girl is a minor. It's felony. - That's it, felony. Let's record that! But, pal, don't turn the tables! I knew nothing about this story. This is a town of fools! - Doc, better set this matter aside for now. Set it aside, great idea! Let's make a generous and merciful clean sweep. Bravo, sergeant. So may I..? Don Antonio, calm down. And don't be too smart! You know very well there are other charges. Sit down. Let them in. I deny! Well said! Nice testimony. - You deny what? I was sick. The doctor didn't heal me. So I called Don Antonio who healed me. In a few minutes. A miracle. Not a miracle, but... - Shall we still listen to the chatter of this charlatan? How dare you? Stretcher bearer! - Stop! Enough! All envy, cause Don Antonio is the best of all! What're you good at? At pulling a dead dog's tail? Enough! Sit down! So you all deny being in cahoots to the doctor's detriment. - We deny it. "We deny it." Officer, summon Don Antonio's niece. No, wait, she can't testify, she's consanguineous. Firstly, that's not true. And then it's not a testimony but just a deposition. OK, then I myself will testify. Yeah... Uh... I'll admit that I and my old pal Umberto, right?.. we've organized... a little prank on our doctor, that true? True! So what? We're a small village, with no cinema, we can only have a little fun among ourselves. You're offended? Cut off the offended part! No, who's offended? You pulled a prank on me? Now I'm pulling one on you. Ebb and flow! Don Antonio, laughing and joking, you bought two apartments in Battipaglia, and you're co-owner of the Cinema Rainbow in the same town. So, Don Antonio, what do you say? This too is a miracle. Wha... what's this gathering? Can't we close the window? No. No. I'm hot. - He's hot. What do you want? For years, years, I've worked looking after these people. You work for free? I don't sell scapulars, concoctions, dried toads! Eh, the superstition! But superstition has always existed. Superstitious people are more than people who'd swear on the efficiency of medicine. Sure enough! You, for example, sergeant. Don't you have a coral amulet attached to your wristwatch? And I bet you've no pills for rheumatism in your pocket, despite your pains. The fact is, gentlemen,.. that the misery and ignorance of people are little known. Granted, it's nobody's fault, it's centuries old stuff, it takes time. Why are we amazed if they prefer centuries old caring systems? They believe in certain things? Well, I... I satisfy them. So they feel... understood, and maybe believe they feel better. At times, you know, they're truly fine! Because the will to heal does more than any drug. I'm through. - I too think you're through! Now, if you don't mind, we will continue the confrontation at Miss Mafalda's home. She has not yet recovered, and obviously can't go out. No objection? - Agreed. Officer, take the report. Hey, you! What's wrong? Why that face? I'm not talking to you. - Why? What a fool you made me look, like a jerk, with the egg and hen. No big deal! Now let's not make a tragedy out of this nonsense. And why are you blaming only me? Blame also your grandpa! Nice pair the two of you make, you and my grandpa! Look at what lack of respect! - Yeah, respect! With apartments and cinema we're staking our reputation with the whole town. Were it only for the reputation! Here we're risking jail. Why? You fought like a lion! - With these! But now there's the other, the madwoman. If she confirms the 3000 weekly, the pendulum and the rest... Let's do something! - Scarafo', we're in fate's hands. Maestro. Take it, touch it, you never know! What's this? - A rabbit foot, against evil spell. You never know. Scarafo', please! - Why, excuse me? Try it, touch it. The formula! - What formula? Rabbit foot, save my loot. Rabbit foot, save my loot... Miss? Miss? - Yes. A cable. Open the window. SEEN NEWSPAPER PHOTO WILL ARRIVE AT 18:25. CORRADO Miss Mafalda is in? - Come in. Thank you. What? Miss? Miss Mafalda! I saw the photo in the paper... But why did you do it? Have I changed much? Don't look at me. Don't look at me, please. Let's have a drink. - But there's nothing here. What do we care? What a trip! What a trip! - Where do you come from? From... Naples. Naples? It's 40 km, half an hour by train! Yes, but eternal. Eternal for me is even an instant, y'know. Tell about you. - Tell about you. - No, tell me about you. How long have you been in Naples? What? - How long have you been in Naples? If you knew what I've been through, my Mafalda! But you know it all, I wrote you. Don't dig it up again. You wrote me? You didn't receive anything? In what province is Pianetta? Avellino. - There, I've put Salerno. But you wrote me so many times from the front! The front? What front? Ah, yes! But then I got sick. I've been sick at my head. A nerve infection, catarrh... Such bad moments! Then I was taken prisoner. Damn bastards! They tortured me! No! Really? Those Bedouins, with their large gowns. Black as night. Black all over! But, weren't you in Russia? Huh? - Weren't you stationed in Russia? How should I know? Who can say? After five years of war you no longer recognize anyone. Then the other day, I open the newspaper, and who do I see? Me! Young, handsome. Don't look at me. Don't look at me. Tell me about you. No, tell me about you. But always about me I gotta talk? What else? When I understood you still awaited me, Mafa'... I cried! Because I thought... "Yeah, imagine!" "She no longer believes that Corrado still exists!" Also my wife saw me with this face and said... You knew I got married, eh? I wrote you. That damn witch! She lured me into a snare! But now there's you. You can save me, can't you Mafa'? Mafa'... - How? Will you save me? - How? - With an annulment. There's the annulment, y'know? In Mexico. It takes money. With that you can do anything, y'know? I'll rebuild my life, Mafa'. For, what is my life now? Poor life of mine, thrown in the waste! You think mine was a marriage? It was blackmail, y'know? They told me, "Either marry or go to jail!" How's that? One goes to war... to give you the way to get richer? They snared me! Mafa', y'know what? Besides an annulment we'll make 'em give us a lot of money! Hey! They gotta refund us! I know, you're good-hearted, but after I tell you all, you too will rage! That vile ugly bitch! Tell me, your brother still has that wine business? Yes. If I were of use, he can arrange... Anything. Debt collection, representation... Any job. Even just nominal. For my Mafalda, anything! Wanna smoke? Have a cigarette. It's a matter of time. But we'll sort it all out, what'll take? A lawyer. Do you have a lawyer? Doesn't matter, I have it. But for the first deeds, for the first moves, we need some cash, Mafa'. It takes money, money! I'm full of obligations! Obligations? - Yes, obligations. Debts, debts! Mafalda, dear, I can't handle it anymore. I've knocked on every door. What can I say? Help me, Mafalda. I'd make do with just a little. I've nothing more. - What's that? What a shame! What a shame! Well, gimme. I mark it all. It's as in a bank. Go away. What is it? - Go away! Let go of me! What're you doing? You too now? Hey... I'll be going now... Hey, where's this train going? This train, where's it going? No news. I went up to Borgonero. Okay, you can go. I don't get it. She wasn't in the vineyard, nor in the church... Teresa, go to Ms. Elisabetta. I hope not it happened an accident! No. I sent a cable for news, and you'll see that... Miss Mafalda! What have you done, Holy God? We were all worried. Mafalda! Where the devil have you been? Bug off! What're you laughing at? Good evening. So many people. You'll excuse us, Miss Mafalda. Perhaps you had forgotten... We're here in order to put on record your statements. You remember? For the denunciation you made. Ah, yes. Nothing is true. - What? Maybe I was ill. What I said about Don Antonio... is not true. Don Antonio is a wise and disinterested friend. Yes. For 15 years he's told me Corrado was alive. And he was alive! Then he told me he was dead. I didn't believe him. But he was right. Corrado is really dead. Dead forever. Alright... Have you seen? Good morning. This is your linen. - Well, come in. I'll leave it and go at once. I wouldn't want you to think badly. Eh... No less! If you got offended, I'm sorry. I've stitched two buttons here. You tore them the night you got angry. Black. Give thanks to God. After how you made me look foolish! So now you'd be the offended party? You bet! I was put to shame in public. Well, I regret it. Yeah, you regret it. However, I've to find work in another village. - No. I'm leaving anyway. Really? For my fault? No. What did you do? Rather... Rather, what? Well... Nothing. In so many months, the only kind word you told me is "rather". Well, anyway it's better than nothing. Listen... Thanks for all. - For the colic, too? Don't even think about it. If we won't meet again... have a nice trip. But I'm tired of waiting. I love you. Yes, but you can't rule the heart. You know I love you? Me too, so much. I can't stand it anymore! I may do something silly! I'll do a foolishness! He's too much of a tyrant. Too much! Not a chance! He was absolved, unfortunately. You little witch! Go back in the cell! One of these days I'll talk to your captain, got it? Scram! Vanish! - I'll stay here! It's prohibited? Yes! - Where's it written? Clamide! Clamide! Clamide! You called? - You're named Clamide? - No. - So then? Clamide! Clamide! Clamide! Dear Uncle, this is not a possible life. I'll kill myself. Goodbye, Clamide. Look, Clamide... I'll count to three, then I'll pour, eh? One, two, three. But really! Don't you feel moved even in face of death? But what shall I do with you? You tell me! You disobey. You mess around with a scoundrel... You denounce me! Accusing your uncle! Are you a niece? You're a viper in bosom! - And what uncle are you? You treat me like dirt. I serve you, look after you, I even do... hoaxes to deceit people - What're you saying? If I'm a maidservant, why I can't love a serviceman? He's good and honest, what else you want from a guy? A financially safe position! So I'd be a tyrant, eh? But this tyrant you meant to send to jail, this ogre, wants a worthy marriage for you! That you lack nothing! - And I want him! Instead, no, no and no! - No, eh? Then look! Clamide! Clamide! Clamide! Open up! You see these? See them? They're barbituric pills. So you think I ain't got the guts to be serious about, eh? Then look! Clamide! Stop! Clamide! Scarafone! Clamide! Help me up. - What's up? Help me up, I can't make it. Come on, come on! I can't! - What manners! - Go on, push! Help me up! Clamide! My sweet girl! Do it for uncle! Clamide! Clamide! Clamide! Clamide! Clamide! - There she is! - Clamide! Catch me if you can! Where is she? Where? - There, Maestro. - Clamide! Help! - She ran out! Clamide! My sweet Clamide! Open up! What's going on? - She... she's killing herself! Suicide? - Move out, I'll see to it! Go on! Harder, go! Harder, go! Halt! Stop! Stop! Doc, there's a sick girl. - You're at it again? - No, I swear it's not a trick. I don't believe it! You wouldn't say it so loud. - I don't care about people! I don't give a damn! My niece is dying, and if you don't come, I'll report you for denying assistance and I'll kill you! Okay. Take care of my suitcases. Attention, attention! All citizens aged between 10 and 65 years are obliged to go to doctor Marchetti to undergo the vaccination anti-ty... anti-typhus! Eh... They're young, I said to myself. Let them do what they want, in the end. "He loves me, I love him, I'll kill myself..." On the other hand, he's a good boy. Somewhat a northern simpleton... You did well, Don Antonio. And so, now that he's been discharged, I'm going to meet the boy's relatives... In Bergamo, luckily. - You'll return? No, I don't think so. By now, I'm without clients for several months. You hear that? The young doctor... at his reconquest. What a hard head, though! We will miss you. You too. You're the only one who helped me. That's why I came to say goodbye, you only, in the whole town. Thank you. Thank you for your loyalty. By the way, how did you come to learn that Corrado, your Corrado, was dead? He's not dead. Not dead? - He's alive. But he's dead, even though he's alive. Well, Miss Mafa', all the best. The next, come in! And without shove! "Ing"! "Shoving". Will it hurt, doctor? - No. Swab. Off you go. Next. So then? It seems the potion took effect. Or not? Well? What's it to you? For the record! These wizards aren't so fool, in the end. Surely not. Come, come. Yes, even from them we've something to learn. Some tricks... some little deceits... Yes. - Of course, for a good purpose. Won't it hurt? - No. Now I'll rub this here... and you won't feel any pain... Have faith! Uncle, where do you want to sit? - I don't mind. Uncle! - Uhm... We'll arrive at 12:05, if it won't run late. You say it'll run late? - Don't know... Girl? - No! Boy! But weren't males all infamous? - All except this one. Lemme see. Cute. And him? What do I care? I'm no longer alone now. We're going. - You'll return for the baptism, Don Anto'? I don't know. Thank you so much! And may God bless you! - Right you? But I did nothing for you. What? - For you, I did nothing! What do you mean, nothing? And this, then?
