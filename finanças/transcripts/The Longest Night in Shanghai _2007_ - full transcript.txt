I'd love to see him, too. Him. I'd love to see him. Me too. Me too. Both of us... Wait. Let me say it. I... I've never made much effort. We were both hopeful at the beginning. Focused on getting ahead. I fell in love with you. But somehow we just became colleagues. I relied on you too much. I didn't work on our relationship. I guess I held you too tightly. Then the whole celebrity nonsense took over. We played different roles on the road. I got lost then. Damn, celebrities. We should have talked more. To find out what was really going on between us. About the break-up, I even expected you to step up and say it first. I know that. That we are no longer in love. We can't go on like this. I want to change as well. I'm sorry for how I've been. And I'm grateful for all you did. Good. It's worth coming to Shanghai, isn't it? We'd better get going. Go Miho. Can I ask you one last favor? No matter what... I want to make someone in Shanghai look more beautiful. I must stay one more day. Could you change my schedule? You want to make someone beautiful? You really want to? I do. I see. It's your call, after all. We're late again. Late again, same as yesterday. You shouldn't go to work too early hereafter I must work my way up. Otherwise, what is meaning of life? Thanks Lin Xi... Let's attend the wedding. Try this on. You're beautiful. Do you love me?
