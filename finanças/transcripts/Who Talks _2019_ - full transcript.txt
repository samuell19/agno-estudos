"WHO TALKS" - There's something I have to tell you. - OK. Something happened at recess. - Hi Beckis. Everything good? - Yeah. There was a conflict. Ellie happened to get pushed. By a friend, that is. - She's been at the school nurse. - Oh, OK. So it's OK. And it looks a bit worse than it is, but... It's resolved. But who pushed her? Well it was a conflict, like I said. Between two students. But I can easily guess who the other student is. This is not the first time we have this discussion. Well, I can't discuss other students with you. OK, but was someone there when it happened? Well, there should always be someone there. So who...? Well, I was at an After School meeting. - Ruben? - Come here. They both apologized, and Ellie was so good. So mature. But... there was... Nobody was there when she got pushed. And then she had to apologize for getting pushed. And now you think it's resolved. - OK, well... - OK, well now you're informed. So let's get Ellie. Ellie, Ellie! Daddy's here. Ruben, Ruben wrong tactic. Wrong tactic. - Sorry, I'm sorry. - Yes, very wrong tactic. Did you get a note? - They're not letting us in. - Excuse me, we all live here. And you're not from the derby. So stop looking like the bad guy. He's the world's softest. Look how cute he is. Everyone has to have the same note. - But I didn't get a note. - Calm down, calm down. We're going to discuss integration in schools. It looks like a football derby here. And they get to decide about the refugee home? - I can't answer that. - No you can't answer anything. I have one job. To make sure that no unauthorized people get in. It's a security issue. It's a security issue. It's that simple. You may think whatever you want about that. No note, no entrance. After speaking with Alex, um... The situation isn't so acute that he requires - - treatment from us at this time. Well, I don't agree. I see that he's hurt himself again. That hasn't come up in my discussion with him. We encourage that you contacted us again. But we can't see that the situation is a danger for Alex's life. What you could do is to contact your local doctor or healthcare center. Even though the wait time is about 6 months. You could also try your local Youth Guidance Center. They do have experienced welfare officers. That Alex can talk to about all sorts... About school... About girls... Or boys. And you know that if it really gets worse - - you could always contact the emergency clinic... Hey! Excuse me. We want to talk about the integration in schools. I have a note, and they don't have a note, but he lives there... OK. I'll answer all your questions inside. OK. You heard. She's going to answer inside. OK, so... Yeah, that's that. Now I'll open up for questions. Oh, that was a lot of questions. We'll start here. Why are we getting this information now? After the decision already is made? All information has been public from the very start. And you who live in this municipality - - have voted for the decision makers who have decided in this matter. So everything has been executed completely democratically. And there has been plenty of time to make an appeal. Nobody told us about that. How can we make an appeal about something we don't know about? Raise your hands so I can keep up. Thank you. Is it both boys and girls? Those who come to Sweden are boys in majority. Why is it mostly boys? Well... A lot of them are fleeing from their home countries... to escape being sent to the army and war. When you say boys, are they under 18? Yes exactly, under 18. You mean they are deserters? How many of them were child soldiers and carry a lot of traumas with them? But how do you make that evaluation? We have a question here. Isn't it problematic that there are so many boys coming? There'll be an over-representation. We know how guys are in school. They can be very messy. Maybe it will be harder for the women. Isn't that very problematic? It's very good that you bring this up. Absolutely. Just as you're saying, we need to think about gender - - when we think about integration. Just like in all parts of the society. What do you mean, "gender"? That's not what I said. Don't put words in my mouth. It's a matter of right and wrong. That was not my intention. But let's move on... What do you mean, "move on"? Why can't you answer instead? You just move on, move on, move on. You say that all the time, without giving answers. We want answers. Then you have to listen too, right? Thank you. - Drago is my name. - Hi. I come from the former Yugoslavia. A long time ago. Those were other times. But I neither demanded nor received anything for free. We had to work hard for everything I have and what I own. Today you get the feeling that money - - is just being thrown without any plan. It's chaos in the end. All groups adapt eventually. I can't speak for your experience, or what you have been through. But these are underaged children we're talking about. They have come here without money, without parents... From war-affected countries. And the government has decided that all municipalities receive refugees. And so we thought that this location would be most appropriate. It's just because of the integration that we chose to open the home here. Because we have experienced that it's much better - - for these children's well-being if they come to smaller homes. Not these big group homes which only worsen the segregation. But how much money do you spend on each immigrant? They're refugees. What a stupid question. That's a bit hard for me to so briefly answer. Don't you have a budget? But then how that money is portioned out is a bit varied... Just answer the question so people will stop. But in Nacka it was discovered that they couldn't evaluate the age. That it didn't add up. And there are ways for age-testing. So how do you do that? What are you doing? - But please listen... - What a weird question. Now I don't really know what you are talking about, this thing in Nacka. But when unaccompanied refugee children come to Sweden... - How many 17-year-olds can there be? - Please. When unaccompanied refugee children come to Sweden - - they are placed in a first arrival municipality. And there they do make an evaluation. And an investigation. And then they are hopefully sent quickly out to other municipalities. But if it is then discovered that the child's age doesn't add up - - then they are not allowed to stay at the home. But why don't you do age tests on everybody? I don't know how to answer that without repeating myself. - I had a question about the school. - Yes, that's right. - Do you have kids? - Yes. - How old are your kids? - We don't know who these children are. But... Are your kids in elementary school? Am I not supposed to let my kids out anymore? Yes. What? How old are your kids? My kid is 16. How old is your kid? Can't my kids... I don't know if I dare to let my own kids out. Did you lock them up? Then you know that there are limited resources... But we don't know who these kids are. No, but... I'm talking about the kids that already go to school. I'm talking about the kids already going to school. - Can we get the microphone there? - Yes. Where is the microphone? OK... We'll take it from there then. We don't know who these kids are. I don't know if I dare to let my own kids out. - You have to get to know them. - They are just kids. In my day the kids could play free wherever. Why wouldn't they be able to? Do you have any guarantees for the safety? I have met these kids. It could be dangerous. I have met these boys. They're completely norm... They have bed times just like every child. They go to bed at ten on weekdays. Maybe you could better answer this question. We haven't seen any difference in the statistics - - in those municipalities that receive refugees that there would be any increase in crime. That's not it. Don't you watch the news? This is about placing resources. These are kids we're talking about. - Exactly. - Our kids. Exactly. I have a question. My question is about resources for kids. You have a question. My dad has been on the wait list for this retirement home for ages. And now you go and make it into a refugee home. I don't understand what you're thinking. First we need to take care of our own citizens - - before we can think about others. They are kids. We really have to round up now. But just to answer your question. - This question... - It's your job to answer. Reconstructing had been on the agenda for a long time. And we saw this as... a solution... We saw this as an opportunity to develop this into... a more developed field. A field for gang rapes? What the hell. Excuse me. Excuse me. I've lived in this town for ages. And I have never been afraid for my daughter's safety. Until today. When I listen to you guys. If my daughter had to flee to another country... And they talked about her in this way... - I don't know what I would do. - No. They're kids. As long as your daughter doesn't have a mustache. What the fuck. So unnecessary. Let her answer. We have to wrap up now. We'll take one last question. Oh, that was a lot of questions. But we only have time for one question. I feel like I haven't gotten an answer about the guarantee - - for our security. Are these kids going to be allowed to go freely? - OK, thank you all for coming. - Yes, because they're not criminals. But, please... But the school. Are these kids... Will there be added resources? I wonder if there's going to be more resources because - - if they're going to start the school as it is now... There are no resources as it is now. Hello, Karin, Karin! You said that you had kids. Yes, I have kids. That's why I understand why this is so important. - Don't you think we have kids too? - Do you think you know better than us? Oh, sorry! No, I don't think you do. Can't you just listen to me. I have to go, I have to go home. - You can't leave right now. - I have a son at home. He's been waiting for me. He's tried to get a hold of me. But can anyone just listen? I don't know if I can say it in any other way. Please just listen. - I've tried explaining... - Hi, Niklas. Now you have to be calm. - So we can discuss what happened. - But... Karin: But you have to listen... But nothing happened, you say, but something did happen. But, Karin... I'm sorry. Excuse me. Can you just tell them that nothing happened? Can you tell them that nothing happened? - It doesn't matter. - Niklas, look at me. I knocked over a chair in a meeting room. It's a little more than just knocking a chair over. No, it's not.
