Ouch! - Ouch! - Are you Chris John? - Do you still love to hit people? - What is this place? Crocodiles! Crocodiles! Calm down. Someone must be playing with us. It seems like we're in a reality show. Where are the cameras? What camera? Those are real crocodiles! I'm scared. I'll run away! Crocodiles! Bar, where did we fall from? - The net! - Why is there a net? Like we were being weighed at clinic. - Clinic? - Yes. What are you looking for? - Where's the mung bean porridge? - Don't joke around! Crocodiles! - What are you doing? - Praying. Those are crocodiles. Better to climb a tree than to pray. - Where are you going? - Find a taxi! Can we get some food beforehand? Don't ask for trouble, it's better that we find refuge. Bar! Wait! Another one! - Run! - Relax! Don't run! - They must've been tamed. - Tamed? Just try approaching them. Try it. - My foot! - Relax! Try to pat it. Caress its muzzle. Muzzle. Don't use your left hand! It's impolite! - Okay. - Caress it. Ouch! Damn you! No! Crocodiles don't like people saying bad words! You're a dead man! - Crocodiles! - Crocodiles? That's you. I'm loyal. - There are real crocodiles! - Run! Crocodiles! - Jis! - What? Look, there's a sack. Bar! Are you crippled? There's a distraction. Wait. - Why are you throwing the lamb meat? - You want to feed it in its mouth? - Let me have this. - Why? - It's expensive. - What are we going to throw then? Some cheaper meat, but not this one. - A cheaper one? - Yes. A cheap one? Here. Why won't they attack me? Bar! Akbar! Mom! You jerk. That's how much you hate me? Am I not at all tempting? - Ernest! - Sorry, I thought it was mud. Crocodiles! - Help! - Be patient! Don't move! - How can I? - Don't move! I'm falling! Take that! - I think we got into a Batman trap. - Batman? Why is he trapping us? He's a good guy. It's just slang. "Batman trap" is just slang! He didn't trap us? Is it Joker? Or Mr. Penguin? No need to go that far, lots of them in Senayan. - Jis. Look. - What? Wait. - Hurry. Jis. I'm going to run. - Guns. Which one is good? But there's no bullets in it. Arigato. You have any bullets? No? Me neither. Let me go! Mom! Where's the bullets? You're bad. We're not friends anymore. You're the one eating me! If I were food, I would have eaten myself! I'm hungry, too! You want to eat me? I'll eat you first! Open this first. Ouch! Don't touch my butt. - Sorry, it's instinctual. - Don't take advantage of this. Look. There's someone there. Let's go there. Help! Don't go this way. - Go this way. - Come on. - What? - Excuse me, are you busy? Help us cut this. - Hey! Slowly. - Slowly. In the name of God. - Say what? - What. - No! - He means "Thanks." - Thanks. - Thanks. Don't thank me, thank the one up above. - Thanks. - Thanks. - I mean God up above. - Is God only up above? God is everywhere. We even have God in our heart. You're electrocuted? Stupid crocodile. You're sorry now? You're electrocuted now! There's electricity? I can charge my phone then. Where's my phone? I'm a snake demon. We're reptiles. What's this? Only bullets? I'll shoot you. Bang! Bang! I don't have any more. Bang! Help! Are you battling the crocodiles? They're afraid of moving things. They'll feel threatened. Don't they detach their tail when they're threatened? How stupid you are. That's a gecko. Let's find a way out. Oh, God! The tail is detached, just like a gecko. Am I crazy or is the crocodile an idiot? Or is it the child of a gecko and a crocodile? Bullets. Where's the gun? Ernest, shoot them! There's no... Bullet, give it to me! There are bullets here. Who is that? He'll be dead, eaten by crocodiles. It's a good thing I love to watch Meteor Garden. He's good! You can do it. - Of course. - Of course. Tang, crocodiles! - Tang, gun! - Bullets! - Yes. There you go. - Catch it. Why are you throwing this? Catch this! - Here! - What are you doing? Throw them! You threw them. You shoot it. Here are the bullets. Eat them. I'm tired. - Throw that, Tang! - Wait! You're dead. A water dipper? Who would take a bath here in the jungle? Tada, I'm coming! Mudy! Where are you? What a hassle. Mudy! Where are you? Mudy! What's with this "Mudy, Mudy" call? Ge! A brush? To clean this jungle? I thought it was a bomb. You scared me. Turns out it's just an alarm clock. Oh, God. That's the mother. The mother of crocodiles! - She's furious, her kids are killed! - Run! Wait for me! Stop! There's an electric fence here! Hurry! It's electrified! Maybe that's the fuse box. Shoot it. Not electrocuted, right? Like I said, it's safe now. - Ernest! - Run! - You're dead. You're going to explode! - Come on! EIGHT MONTHS AFTER INI BANK ROBBERY - Gambling is... - Talking about gambling... I don't understand it at all. Waitress, one hot tea. - Tequila? - Hot tea. Okay. Talking about gambling... Gambling is the most unserious job. No need to make money from gambling. Just from Stand Up Comedy, I already make pretty good money. Around five million rupiahs. In a year. - Hi, I'm Arie. - Dhea. - Arrest him. - What's this? - You come with us. - What's this? I'm innocent. Come to the station with us. - That's cool... - This is the warrant for your arrest. Wait! It's okay to arrest me, but I have to zip up first. Oh, no. Tomorrow, okay? Don't run. This one, he's so elusive. No clue? From street cameras? Mall, supermarket, airport, station CCTVs? - No. - Bus station, restaurant CCTV? - Nothing at all. - No way. Hey, what are you looking at? But let me tell you something about them. These guys are weird. My name's Cynthia. And? I'm stationed here to investigate all the suspicious activity Your status right now is still suspect. Before you're put in jail. You understand me or not? - Yes. - Sit. - I'm just going to stand. - Sit your ass down! My request first. Okay? An umbrella. Open it. Use it. If you don't use it, I won't sit. Can we start? It's broken. I told you I better stand up. These are the photos from the crime scene. Mysteriously, the police file case database is hacked. These are your photos, right? Yes, this is you. Of course not. Look at me, I'm handsome. I have a sharp nose. He doesn't. Look. Look, here. Whose photo is this? Here. Look closely. Whose photo is this? - Adrian, what are you giving me? - It's real. There. Look at it. Here. Where were you when the robbery occurred? - Where do you want me to be? - I was in my hometown. - I was watching a show. - What show? It's... a magic show. I was on my way to my crush's home when rain suddenly started pouring down. I was soaking wet. It was cold. We're the descendant of Safa, Same Face. - It's your family? - My face is similar to my brother's. Look, our faces are similar. Look, similar. How about you? Do you have a loved one? I was watching this. Check it out. "Masculinity enhancer. To enlarge..." What's this? No. Mine is big. Just ask him. Mine is big, right? - My masculinity. - Adrian. - Adrian, come on. My size. - Wait, stop! - Why are you panicking? - Because of him! Yes, I'm serious... when I'm with you. What do you mean? Is this you or not? Sorry. What did you say? Hey, Miss Siti Nurhaliza... What? She's Malaysian, I'm Singaporean. Can't you tell the difference? Miss Singapore, is that me? Look closely. He has small eyes. Yes, I love you. - Can you move forward a bit? - Yes. A little bit more. A bit more. - A bit more. - You're so pretty. A bit more. She baptizes my phone. Where's the brochure? Wait. Maybe in this envelope. No. Not this. Where is it? - What are you looking for? - The proof for the magic show. Hey! - Not this. - Keep going. Got it. This is it. The real ticket. A magic show. - Hand this to Mr. Anggi. - Yes, ma'am. Open it. As manager and attorney, I object to the reason for my client's arrest. According to the Constitution, Chapter 28 Clause 1 and 2, all Indonesians are free to choose their religion. So, what's the reason for their arrest? Obviously for the INI bank robbery. Don't be negative. Where's the real and concrete proof? Because when the bank was robbed, they were somewhere else. How can they be... at two places at the same time? Don't joke around. You're the one who shouldn't joke around. - Me? Joking around? - Yes! I never joke around, especially when facing a hot, beautiful woman like you. - You know that, right? - What do you mean? - What do you mean? - What did you say? - What did I say? - I could sue you. - Talking carelessly to an officer. - I am never careless. Me, 25 years old, Aquarius, blood type A, single. I want a good family, I want four kids, two daughters and two sons and they all live with an old song by Trio Kwek-Kwek. "I'm afraid my dad will be angry because I'm not going to school." Dad, no school, angry. I'm worried about my clients, especially when they're arrested unjustly. And that police officer gives her BlackBerry pin to me voluntarily. - What? - "What" what? - What did you say? - What did I say? BlackBerry pin? 39ee37. You don't write it? 39ee37. We both like roses. All I need is only the information of who their boss is. - We just wait and keep watching them. - Okay. And then? We reinvestigate all of the bank's customers. What happened with you, Cynthia, and him? This case was closed months ago. Don't reopen it. We don't open things, especially when you're not married. Funny, right? - Yeah, funny. - Hello? Cat? We don't have any business with cats. What? We have caught. The crazy doctor and Cak Lontong. Now tell me, who's the robber? How was the setup and who gave the data to the police? Data? It can be from a good person who wants to help the police. It can be from one of them who turns them in. - We don't know. - You don't know? How can you people get those bastards without any data? What is this? Cynthia, you're Interpol. What's your business here? You're wasting your time. We call it "wasteful." - And wasteful is the friend of Satan. - What does it have to do with me? - But it's funny, right? It's funny. - Yeah. Sir, you better change your profession to a comedian. How about that? Tell him what a comedian is. - "Pelawak." - "Pelaut (seaman)." Pelaut? Our ancestors were seamen. Comedian. - But do comedians make a lot of money? - Compared to the police? Of course comedians make more. You're funny, too. You're funny. I'm having a meeting, okay? Hey, is he still a comic? I think he is. Okay, everyone, thank you for coming. Don't ever be fooled by appearances and scrape normal understanding in handling an abnormal case. This guy has information about The King. But he's the fifth person we checked. According to my logic, The King is only a myth. He's not actually real. Uncle Indro has told us, "Scrape normal understanding and logic." - Your brain has defected. - Hey, chill! How can we work without logic? Using this. Rasa (feeling). What rasa (flavor)? Chocolate? Or vanilla? - What? - I'm not a Hajj yet. Me neither. Just hurry! In the name of God. Arie! The King is an amazing criminal master who operates in every illegal gambling site all over Asia. That's why he is called "The King." And as a criminal master, he will make it seem like he doesn't exist, that he's only a myth, so that law enforcers like us would think that he doesn't exist. That is their job to deceive us. I know without Mudy, there's an empty space in this 8 Team. And it hinders your job. But not to worry, I've arranged for a senior agent. I've put her in Indonesia's entertainment business for a long time. - Mr. Dono? - He's still alive. He has a baby face. So, Boss Indro call Mr. Dono to find the casino? No, no. This is Agent Temon. I hope he can help you. Agent Temon is ready to do his job. There's eight of us now, so the name Comic 8 is fitting. God be with you. - What's that? - Weapons. There are bullets. Kemal, you threw a ticking bomb at the crocodile. Did it explode? What ticking bomb? It was an alarm clock. An alarm clock? You think the crocodile needs to wake up for Suhoor? But there's no magazine. I'm out of them. Magazine? I have it. Why didn't you tell me? - An Arab sword. - Here, you just use this. Good afternoon. Congratulations. You have passed level 1. On level 2... you will face the top assassin group in one third of the world. Their track record has been proven for 30 years. You can take any weapon you like. This is a game of survival. The option is to kill... or be killed. And for the assassin squad... have fun. Nest, did you hear the announcement? Of course, I have small eyes, not small ears. Let's go to our hometown on business. Ri, instead of that, we better find the assassins. - We kill them before they kill us. - Come on. Okay, we have to be fast. Not waste any time. Right now, we have to... hide. There's a different aroma. How nice. You want to die, Rat? Correction. Not a rat, but a wolf. There's no wolf with Mickey Mouse ears. This means I'm a good listener. Hey, Rat, where are we heading to? - A wolf! - A wolf. They're... going that way. There they are. - What's that? - Is that a dragonfly? Attack! Ouch! Hey, Junior. I'm sure he's one of The King's agents. I ask you one more time. Where's The King hiding? Where? You won't talk? Where's his illegal gambling headquarters? - Where? - Hey, sir. Do you have to use violence? Junior, just shut your mouth when a senior is working. You impolite guy. You better watch how seniors do things. This guy... I know you're strong. But just so you know, everyone has a weakness. And I'm going to find your weakness. Got it? There's no way you won't talk with this. Wait! Senior agent, take a rest for a while. - Can you do it alone? - We'll see. - Take a rest. - Okay, then. We don't want you to get sick. You want this? This is good. Where did you buy them? They're from Singapore. We don't have these in Indonesia. This is the best donut in Asia, and in Africa. You want this? First, you tell us where The King's headquarters is. Tell us where The King's headquarters is. Hey, hurry. West Cilincing km 32. Just go straight, there'll be a gas station. Take a U-turn at the gas station. The second intersection, a house with a black fence. It's the furthest house, in front of a car shop. Yay, I get one. Donut! Donut! Donut! Hey! If we can use a donut, why should we use muscle? LAPO TUAK THE KING Look. - Is he really here? - He has his name on the sign. It's not like we were thinking. Chill. Remember what Boss Indro said. Maybe this is camouflage so the casino won't be noticed. Okay then, let's check it out first. - Why are you doing a selfie? - It's for proof. Good point. Together? TOILET PUMP 24 HOURS TV ANTENNA INSTALLATION CLOWN FAST CASH ADULT ONLY TV CHANNEL That's the sound of gunshots. Formation! Go! Ouch! Why are you stopping? What? Is there a traffic stop? I don't think this is the place. Take a look. There are only people playing cards. They're only acting. It's pretend. - Camouflage. - Move! Don't move! Hey! Freeze! Hey! Sit! Don't stand! Walking to the botanical garden, don't forget to buy some taro. Just chill, bro. Going to school as well as buying tobacco. What's your intention coming here? Amang Bolu Jejen eats coconut. What do you want to eat? Careful. We have to answer this correctly. We can't miss any more clues. Bujang! Banana eaten by Sonya. Catfish eaten by Papat. If we may, we want to ask something. If not, it's okay. Don't talk in rhymes, it takes too long. Just ask the question. Buying earrings at the Chinese market. Where's The King? You want to shoot? Go ahead. Here. Hurry! Hey, your guns won't hurt us. Not even a scratch. Now, you shoot it, let me hear how it sounds. Gunshot! Oh, God! Those guns are real! Look at them all. They're just small fry, insignificant. Let's just go! Hey, easy for you to talk, young man. You said we're insignificant gamblers? Hey, we're the real kings. Show them. King of dogs. Danger! Is there anyone more "king" than us? Show them! How dare you disrupt my business. I'll smash your heads in! Damn you! Where are the shots coming from? Our attacker is a woman, how can we counter her attack? - We'll be damned. - Shoot them! Hey, do you want to shoot or be shot? Too much talk, too long. Pay attention to us, Senior Agent. Watch closely. - He's not afraid to die. - To the side. - Senior's dead. - Thank... Wait. I mean, too bad. Come on, let's deal with her. So, you're lost in a Bataknese alcohol bar? Not bad. Though the place is small it's also a place to sell illegal weapons and drugs. - And Agent Temon was killed. - He's not a team player. - He has a post-power syndrome. - Don't be like that. We'd better pray for him to be accepted on God's side and his family to be strong and that his new wife is being passed on to one of us. - Amen? - Amen. Boss, when will Mudy come back from his mission to Mexico - to complete our team? - Soon. But is the information about The King being one of the comedians true? That's A1 information. Accurate. Okay then, what are we waiting for? Let's just investigate it. We can also join the Stand Up Comedy tour with the comics. Yes, boss. Let's investigate the comics and also the promotors. Okay. I'll arrange it so you can join the tour. And in the meantime, I'll have Ge Pamungkas accompany you. Ge! - Yes, boss. - Ge, in the meantime, accompany them in the field. So, you're going in the field. - Me, boss? - Yes. You'll accompany them and complete the team as Comic 8. That's the main idea. - Seriously? - Seriously. When am I ever not serious? Thanks, boss. So, they'll need help. Especially when we need to communicate, you tell me what happens in the field... Ge? It's his bad habit. Either he pisses himself or he faints. Hey! You're the ones who want to kill us, aren't you? Just admit it! Hey, something wrong with your eyes? You saw us get attacked by the crocodile earlier. Use your brain! See? This is a conspiracy. Admit it! Just relax, don't panic. I'm not afraid. Hey, I think I know where we are. Guys, relax, okay? We're on the same team. We're in this together. We don't know why we're here. - That's not true. - What? Not everyone here doesn't know why we're here. - What? - Keep saying "what." Something's wrong with your ear. How do you know that not everyone here doesn't know why we're here? It's getting complicated. Why don't you be more straightforward? - Nest, do you know or not? - Just tell us where we are, Nest. Why are you asking me? How do I know? Usually the innocent one is the one who knows. Me, I really don't know why we're here. - This is it. - Hey! - I really don't know! - Are you a crocodile handler? I saw you talking to a crocodile earlier. I get it now. You want to feed your pets? - Damn you! I'll kill you first! - Hey! Mongol, Kemal, Ernest, Arie, Babe, Fico, Bintang! Focus! We're on the same team! How does he know my name? Hey, don't act like you know us. How do you know my name? That's right. How do you know? Maybe you're a spy. An agent? Hello? This is Mudy. I'm not Mudy. Who put a corset on me anyway? I'm Ge Pamungkas! And yes, I'm an agent, just like all of you. You're an agent, you're an agent, you're an agent. You're all agents? Just kill everyone. I'm feeling dizzy. Stop it! Stop it! What is this? Attack them! I'm out of bullets. Run! - They're playing with us. - True. We were supposed to rob a bank, not be stranded in the jungle. Lots of mosquitoes here. So itchy. Hey! There's a pop quiz. - I've loved this since I was a kid! - In the jungle? ANSWER 2 QUESTIONS "Two questions and two prizes." Who knows if the prizes are makeup kits. - I'll press the button. - No, this could be a trap! Oops, I pressed the button. "A human breathes with its lungs, a fish breathes with..." Its gills. What? Water? WRONG ANSWER!!! Oxygen. Lungs. Water, oxygen in the water. - What's the answer? - I know the answer. A human breathes with its lungs, a fish breathes with... It's easy. God's permission. CORRECT!!! What? It's a biology question, but the answer is religious? I'm the expert. Second question. "You can see the weasel across the sea. The elephant on your eyelid..." It's a proverb. "You can't see that." WRONG ANSWER!!! Invisible. The elephant breathes. God's permission. WRONG ANSWER!!! Don't be too emotional. Let me answer. You can see the weasel across the sea. The elephant on your eyelid... - What's the answer? - It's easy. Just think. Oh, God! It's impossible. An elephant is huge, it'll be too heavy. CORRECT!!! See? Correct, right? - What kind of proverb is that? - Don't... Kuntilanak! No, it's Pocong! Whatever! No difference! But there's something weird about it. That's a coffin. That's the weapon. - Is that a guitar? - Your weapon. - Take it. - Why me? That's yours. - Say it, "Excuse me." - Excuse me. - I can't take it. - I'll hold it. So sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. What a nice shroud. That's my prize. It can be a makeup kit. I'm so happy. How can we put him in? One, two, three. - Wait. - What are you doing? You think he's a Chinese vampire? Let's just do an exchange. Let's just go. JAVA INDONESIAN OCEAN In these past two years, I see more and more motorbikes in Jakarta. Jakarta motorbikers are peculiar. They chat as they drive on a noisy road with a full helmet. What can they hear? They can only nod. They won't hear each other. Women, complicated and bizarre. Complicated clothes. Not only their outer clothes, even their underwear is complicated. Let's just call it "BRA." I saw an ad yesterday that said there's a bra with infrared. Even a bra with infrared. Are you going to send a picture with it? There might be a bra with Bluetooth someday. With advanced technology, there might be a Wi-Fi bra. It's a hassle. You might need a password to open it. Guys after being in the gym think that they look like an action star, so cool. But when they are called "Darling," they all look behind them. They may be muscular, but they're also soft. I don't understand beauty. I hear there are beauty lessons. You can learn beauty? I know you can learn mechanics. You can learn lathing. Now, if you're beautiful, why would you need the lesson? If you're not beautiful, you want your face to be lathed? Isn't that weird? When you ride a motorbike, suddenly the police show up. "What's up, sir?" Pretty woman, walking down... Get over yourself. SEA OF JAVA I've been on another sketch comedy show on TV. The director loved me. My acting was great. I almost got a nomination for The Best Hanuman. "Happy Hero's Day. Mom and Dad, the true hero in my life." Why do you mention your mom and dad? Are they Teuku Umar? A lot of guys are upset they don't get any girls. There are also guys upset their girl doesn't get their monthly visit. Guys, we know basic colors. Red, yellow, green, blue. That's it. Girls are not. For them, colors are more detailed. Burgundy red, tosca green, navy blue, piss yellow. Everything's got a name. Youngsters nowadays use modified words. "Ya kali" becomes "ya keles." Even the Kalimalang area becomes Kelesmalang. BORNEO "When are you going to get married?" is harder than the national exam. You can cheat during exams. "When was the First World War?" "I know the answer. Before the Second World War. Yes!" I've always loved action movies and I'm amazed by the actors because it takes a lot of work to shoot it. Repeatedly shooting the same scenes. When there's this scene, "Hait ciat hait ciat." Suddenly the director comes, "I told you, the dialog is 'ciat wat wat ciat wat.'" I'm a Bekasi citizen. And it's not nice to be one. We've been insulted since we were kids. They say Bekasi is far, hot, tacky, cheesy. It's true, but don't make a fuss over them. I'm very proud of Jakarta's governor, Mr. Basuki Tjahaja Purnama aka Ahok. I'm a bit disappointed. I thought he'd have different bodyguards than previous governors. He doesn't. I thought once he became the governor his bodyguard would be a Shaolin. Bald, small. Doesn't look dangerous, but if he spits a pine nut at you, you'll have a hole in your head. Inner power. When he's ambushed, he'll take it easy. All dead. "Knock knock." There's a bird. "As-salamu alaikum." I think, "What a cool bird." Then my friend comes out. "What bird is that?" "It's a sparrow." "Why as-salamu alaikum?" "It converted." The next day, I come back there. I knock, but the bird makes no sound. "Dude, why is it quiet?" "It's a Hindu now, doing Day of Silence." - What's up, guys? - How you doing? - Why are you throwing at him? - He asked for it. - That's not what he meant. - It's okay. Baldy, give me a beat. DJ Amban is in the toilet, yo! Introducing, we're Skinny! I know those two. They're Celebtube. Celebrity Raptube? They're too skinny to be one. Comics, we finally meet Let's talk about numbers Math that can get rid of sorrow I'm sure you'll like it -Expose, ipos -Boarding house member You just focus on becoming a comic. Just follow the movement. We'll see where it ends. - Someone will take care of them. - Okay. We're on it. Yo! Comics We're just taking you to the door Because we are paid up front Don't be afraid of sorrow Because sorrow is between love and feeling Peace and love Hi, I'm Bella. Hi, Bella! Do you know why I invited you here? You're looking for a band, right? - Husband. - Then I want to apply. She wouldn't want to be with you. Be with me, miss. I can still have one more left of the maximum four wives. Hey, not "Miss"! Call her "Missus." Unfortunately, that's not the reason I invited you. I invited you here to offer you a job. I'll pay you ten times your usual fee... to do stand-up comedy in a casino on a private island. But with several terms and conditions. "Terms and conditions"? It's like a lottery. If you can't be cooperative, please get out of here. No, no, no. I don't mind that, I'll wear a diaper if I have to. But about the fee, it's ten times higher or lower? Time? You think it's a clock? - Of course ten times higher. - That's what's important. The terms are you can't tell anyone about your location. And all communication devices will be left here in this room. So, after this, you'll depart immediately. - So, any objections? - My heart's heavy. Because when you measure me, my body's not ideal. So, I'm heavy. I mean with the terms mentioned. The point is... no one can know your location until the event is finished. It's only two-three days. - Understand? - Understood. But is the island comfortable? If it's not, we can go to the island of marriage, just the two of us. - Men. - What? Why men? - So much money! - So much money! - Oh, my God! So much money! - Oh, my God! - I don't want to die. - The map! - Map! - Stupid! - Why do you say I'm stupid? - Here. I've told you that when I move my head towards them, you ask for the map. - You didn't say that. - You nodded when I said it. - When? - You said you understood. You only moved your eyebrow. You said this, not this. - You... - You didn't say that. - Excuse me. - What? - Do you still want the map? - Oh, yeah. Sorry. Thanks. What? The cloth! What cloth? - The handkerchief! - Give it to them? Yes! Tell them to inhale it. Hey! Inhale it! - What? - Inhale! Both of you! Just ask them nicely. They understand. Ask nicely, they'll inhale it. But we don't need to talk like this in front of them. - You don't give clear instructions. - It's clear. You're just stupid. - Again with the word "stupid." - Enough! I'm the one who can say "no," you can only say "yes." Understand? Dictator! From Kemal. Put it under your tongue to hide it. - Open it. - Don't. It's indecent. - Open it. - I'm ashamed. - Open it. - My mom will be mad. - Open it. - Really? - Open it. - You know Iko Uwais? When he opens it, there's nothing there. Just like me. - Open it. - Hey! Don't. Not mahram. - Open it. - No. No. Miss, can't we trust each other? - You wanted to see. - Enough! But you're surprised. This is an original, not a fake. Where is it? It's a fan. You want her to open it? No! I want that one. Big body, but... Not close enough. You want to call? The handle is down there. Why? You're addicted to this? - Want to party? - Enough! Bamboo propeller! Love... Just leaving after all that you see? Yes. Where is this? Hey, why are you so anxious? We'll land eventually. The pilot will know when we get there. I'm afraid we'll miss it. I often miss my bus stop. I missed my stop from Jakarta to Bandung because I was asleep. - Where did you finally wake up? - Nganjuk. Oh, God. You didn't miss it, you're just an idiot. We can't be sure if we'll survive. So before I die, I want to admit something. I'm actually... I'm actually gay. I'm gay. Jis, you're actually handsome. Rif, you're a bit different. Sep, don't forget Friday prayer. Seven days a week if you can. Please accept me, guys. I'm gay! But that was before. I'm not like that anymore. It's leaking. Let's change our seats. Mas Katon, see? Like I said, just be patient. We'll be arriving soon. Ge, the island, so pretty. That's the island. But don't put your hand here. You're lucky. The King is in a good mood. The King wants to meet you. Please. This is a jewelry store. This is The King's personal collection. Historic things that supposedly have strong supernatural forces. Miss, is this real gold? Nobody knows. We're not allowed to touch it. The bones are made from pure gold. Learn how to speak English properly. It's supposed to be queen, not king. You may have heard of woman's emancipation. Gender equality. Instead of becoming only a term and just being empty words, let's just practice it here on this island. It's a simple answer. - Do you understand any of it? - No. I have a problem with my sense of humor. It's hard to make me laugh. The one who can make me laugh, I'll give them... a bonus. - Nice! - Nice! It's a gold mountain. "Gold mountain"? Even I have it in my hometown. But the gold is mostly taken by foreigners. Tomorrow night you'll have to perform to entertain us all. The gold bar bonus will be given when someone makes The King laugh. Now, enjoy all the facilities on this island. Have fun. Iko, I notice you've eaten nonstop since this afternoon. The sim card you told me to put under my tongue, I accidentally swallowed it. So I need to eat a lot to bring it out. It'll make no difference anyway. The signal here may be blocked. - It is sophisticated. - I still have to get it out. It's a sim card and this is a stomach, not a phone. You're only making excuses. I see you eating all the time. Is that a stomach or a water tank? Cak Lontong? When did he get out of jail? Good point. You're mistaken. I'm Cak Lemper, Cak Lontong's cousin. Cak Lontong is a criminal. He's in jail. Meanwhile, Cak Lemper, I'm a businessman. Remember, Cak Lontong is a criminal. Cak Lemper is a businessman. Don't be confused. People often mistake me for him. Out of 100 people who have met me, almost 101 people thought I was him. - That's not a problem. - Hey, 101? That's more than 100. Because I count you as two people. Black Covra, enter. The sleeping gas can be turned off. Hey, what are you doing? What took you so long? Who are you? He's Isa, I'm Bella. - Isa... Bella? - Right. The love tale of two worlds? Separated because of different traditions? How does he know? I'm a doctor, I studied a long time. A genius. Let's set two of my assistants free. Oh, I forget. I haven't flushed it. Go flush it. - Nikita? - Just chill, boss. I don't even know who the father is. Are you sneaking up on me? POLICEMAN SHOT DEAD And he died in a bank robbery. Your problem is to check this guy. - This guy. - That's Indro Warkop. So if he's a celebrity, he can't be a suspect? Have you met my knights? Isa, the leader of the combat troops. Bella, the leader of the warriors. The leader of the ghost squad. I've met Isa and Bella. The Ghost... Where is he? He was there. He is a ghost. Sometimes he can be seen, sometimes invisible. Really? The casino is getting more and more spectacular. This casino is ten times more than spectacular. Tomorrow, we'll have the real gamble. Live. All around the world. - Who's playing? - The kings of the world. - Is it still being played? - I want to revive it. Since the supply from your hospital has stopped, we no longer have players for our game. Business became slow. That's why we freed you. But my recommendation's okay, right? Your business flourishes? Fantastic. You save my business. You're all dead. But one person's not there. Wait. I know him. He was a nurse at my mental hospital. He's one of them. They're too funny to be a group of police agents. They're too funny to live, Your Highness. I suggest you to divide them into three groups. I've put the program in their brain. I only need to activate it. One person's missing. He's a legendary comedian. - A comedian who hurts his fans. - Okay. Just tell Isa and Bella. They'll provide for all your needs. By the way, will you modify the mind of that legend? No, to make things more heated. We have to find the transmitter tower. But I've been to the western coast, I didn't see it. Maybe that's... - What's that music? - I have a bad feeling. Gas! Gas! Gas! Cover your nose! Fico! Fic! Kemal! Ernest! When you're robbing, let them know you're a cruel person. Show that you've been doing this for years. When you're robbing, show your stupidity. You're not unified. You hesitate. Sometimes you don't know what you'll do. And when you're robbing, the reason is idealism, because you're the weirdest criminals the world has ever seen. It fails? Of course it fails, his head hadn't been programmed. This guy, pretending to be a nurse in my hospital. Fooling people. Tell Bella that all weapons and clothes for tomorrow have been prepared by me. And dip or slather them with chicken curry. Okay? So that they will be more tasty. - Fried noodles, right? - That's right. Fried noodles. Now this is fried noodles, without soup. Do you understand? Fried noodles! Wait, no. Isa, sit here. Keep me company. Tell me why you and Bella can't be together. What tradition separates you two? I'm eating this, okay? Tradition... that has become modern culture... that has been made into law and agreed to by The King for this island. Because of that tradition, The King didn't give us her blessing. He's standing. Whoa. Our relationship isn't approved because... we are not a same sex couple. The relationships that are approved by The King and allowed here on this island... is a same sex relationship. Heterosexual relationships are forbidden. It's a big sin. Okay. There's soup in it now. Hello? Hello, is this the Game? Hello? Yes? No problem. I bet on number two. 15 million yen! Ouch! Where is this? You will face the top assassin group in the world. - Everyone, freeze! - Everyone, get down! - Freeze or get down? - Everyone, get down! Then freeze! - Voilà! - Oh, God! - Come down. - I'm scared! - It hurts! - Where does it hurt? Here. You dare to fight me? - Old man! - A thousand steps technique. Can the hostages confirm from the photo that those comedians are the robbers? Please don't move. I can't get you. Don't move! I have a proposal for you. I can feel it. You like it from the back? The right spot? I won't use my weapon for the thrill of it. As-salamu-alaikum. Lots of people say I've changed. I used to joke that I'm stupid. Now I have become stupid for real. I met someone yesterday. He talked to me. "Fico from Stand Up Comedy?" I'm friendly, so I answer him, "Yes, I am." And what did he say? "No." What? Why is he the one who decides that? If you crash into someone, you should get angry first. Why? So that you look like the right one. So, that guy drove and crashed. He got out and was angry first. "Hey! Don't drive carelessly! Turn the signal on when you're going to turn." The other driver got out. "Why are you mad at me?" "It's your fault! Drive safely. Turn your blinkers on when you turn." "But I've been driving straight." "That's why, you have to turn!" Most of my clothes don't fit anymore. Especially my fourth grade clothes. When I wear that, you can see my nipples. There are many kinds of Indonesian films. There are big screen movies and short movies. You know short films? Short films are the ones that star Ucok Baba. This isn't only for style. It has a benefit. If the City Hall moves to Mangga Dua, it will minimize corruption. Especially office supplies logistics. It's hard, you can check the price next door. Whenever I watch soap operas, I get sick of the clubbing scene. Guys are like, "Let's go clubbing! Where do they go? Jakarta. Where exactly? At home. My hometown is famous for its fishermen. We're great at diving. One day we were swimming late afternoon and my father asked me, "Arie, where's your little brother? It's almost dark. Why isn't he home yet?" "Wait, let me find him." I went looking for him. I went looking for his friends. "Hey, you seen my brother?" "I don't know. He went to the sea and hasn't returned." I went to the sea and searched for him. I found him and took him home at dusk. "Here he is, Dad." My dad scolded him. "Where were you? Why weren't you home before dusk?" "Sorry, Dad. I was diving and fell asleep on the seabed." Thank God I'm in more movies now. My first movie was with Nikita Mirzani. Do you know her? - Yes. - She's... Imagining her makes our chest stuffy. The second movie was with Julia Perez. I felt like I was in the Nature Lovers Club. Going up and down the mountain. A friend of mine, a cameraman, he's cool. There's also Mr. Adi. There's a guy, six pack. He's walking casually. Normal people, when they see shit, "Such a bad dog, shitting everywhere." That's normal. But those two cool guys aren't normal. "Oh, no, it's a shit." No way!
