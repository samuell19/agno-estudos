Ll NCOLN : History prefers legends to men. lt prefers nobility to brutality. Soaring speeches to quiet deeds. History remembers the battle and forgets the blood. Whatever history remembers of me, if it remembers anything at all, it shall only be a fraction of the truth. For whatever else l am, a husband, a lawyer, a president, l shall always think of myself as a man who struggled against darkness. l leave in your trusted hands, my dear friend Henry, this record that begins when l was just a boy. (SHOUTl NG ORDERS) MAN : Get on down there. H urry it up ! (MEN SHOUTl NG) Please, sir, no. There's been some kind of mistake. l ain't no slave. Let them go ! Aaron ! Go back inside ! Let them go !

THOMAS: Are you all right? Did you strike my friend here? He was beating my son ! Did you strike him , Lincoln? They're not slaves, and you know it. l suggest you get back to your work before you find yourself led away in chains. U ntil every man is free, we are all slaves. (CH UCKLES) Very well , then . Since you're all so concerned with freedom , you may consider yourself free from the burden of my employ. And the debt you've been working off, l'd like it paid in full with interest. Now, please. lf you get one more penny from me, Mr. Barts, it will come with a fist wrapped around it. All right, Mr. Lincoln . There are other ways to collect a debt. (DOOR CREAKl NG) NANCY: (SCREAMl NG) No ! THOMAS: What's happening to her, Father? Please help her! Please, l beg of you . You've got to do something , Father. (GASPl NG) (NANCY MUMBLl NG) Easy, child . Look away, Abraham . (SCREAMl NG) l've never seen anything like this. Strange. NANCY: You promise me. (BREATH l NG H EAVl LY) Let's step outside. l'm sorry, l don't know what ails her. NANCY: Abraham . Come and lie next to me. l've been writing , Mama. "Days are swift as an lndian arrow, "flying like a shooting star. "The present day is here, "and then slides away in haste, "that we can never say is ours, "but only say "is passed ." Mother? (TREMBLl NG) Mother? Ll NCOLN : Mama once told me that l hadn't cried when l was born. That l'd simply opened my eyes, looked at her smiling face, and smiled back. My light was gone. l don't know how he did it. . . Abraham , You promise me you won't go and do anything foolish . Ll NCOLN : Nine years later, my father joined her in death. No longer bound by my promise, l tried to fortify the nerve to pursue my vengeance. STU RG ES: Haven't you had enough? A boy only gets this drunk when he wants to kiss a girl or kill a man . BARTS: Adam , Adam , let me explain . ADAM: Last one, Barts. l'm not coming up here to clean up your messes anymore. BARTS: Yes, sir. l promise. (SPEAKl NG l N DlSTl NCTLY) Every so often , l think about what it would be like to be in the South . So, where's Henry? Yes, sir. We've been looking all over, sir. Searching high and low. Low is more likely. J ust find him , Barts. Oh , and send a fresh crop south . We have a lot of mouths to feed . Yes, sir. "Yes, sir, no, sir. H igh , sir, low, sir." For my mother. (BARTS LAUG H l NG) That was unlucky. Might have put me out of my misery. Where the hell are you running to? (LAUG H l NG) Don't much like chasing chickens. Little boy, all grown up. Come to avenge his dear momma. There are two kinds of men , Mr. Lincoln . Those that have the guts to pull the trigger and those who do not. Powder, patch , ball . Don't mess it up. You weren't asleep that night. Were you? (LAUG H l NG) Oh ! You dropped the ball , Mr. Lincoln . (LAUG HS) Your mama's blood was sickening sweet. l hope yours tastes better!

(STAMMERl NG) Yeah , l'm sorry. l didn't see anything ! Should we dive right in? Or are you finding Gabrielle's egress too distracting? l'm sorry, sir, but who are you? Who l am is Henry Sturges. And where you are is my home. And what happened . . . l saved your life during your rather pathetic attempt at taking another's. What were you doing there, and how did you know l would try to kill Barts? How? l watched this boy carry out his first long-awaited mission . Drunk, might l add . And l think, "You have wasted your time watching this one, Henry. "He's not a promising recruit. "He is just a selfish boy with his heart set on vengeance." And l realized , "This boy is a goddamned idiot! " "l doubt he even knew his target was a vampire." A vampire? Yes. lmmortal , blood-sucking demons. Fortunately for you , Mr. Lincoln , hunting them is something of a hobby. But vampires are just myths. Myths don't beat you senseless after you've put a bullet in their brain . Thank you . No, Mr. Lincoln , vampires are real . They exist in every city and every state in the U nion . lf what you say is true, you could help me kill him . l could pay you to kill him ! My services are not for sale. And the word you are looking for is "destroy." lt is quite a feat to kill that which is already dead . But you don't understand . My mother was murdered . And if l teach you how to murder her murderer, so what? How will that honor her memory? How will that benefit the next boy whose mother is taken? lf vengeance is all you seek, seek it elsewhere. Teach me to fight as you do. Please, l'll do anything you say. You promise to cast aside all notions of vengeance and commit to the life of a hunter? You will have no friends, no family. Ll NCOLN : l told him what he wanted to hear, but all l cared about was killing the monster that took my mother. l'm in . Scottish H ighland pistol . And if one barrel isn't enough , seven should do you . The blunderbuss. And if you lose your ball , you can always stuff your pocket watch down the end of it. So, Abe, which one takes your fancy? Actually, l haven't had the best of luck with shooting irons. But, l was a rail splitter. l would like you to chop this tree down with a single swing . That tree? lt's got to be more than a foot across. That's impossible. But it isn't a tree. lt's what you hate most in the world . So, tell me, Mr. Lincoln , what do you hate? l hate Jack Barts. Then strike him down . Well , clearly you don't hate him that much . Tell me what you hate. l hate that my mother was taken away. lnadequate. l hate that we were afraid . And? That my mother and father, everyone that we knew, lived in fear. Pathetic. l hate that l was too small . Too weak. Yes. And that you failed . . . Yes ! . . .to protect her. Yes ! And that you let her die. (YELLl NG) Power, Lincoln , real power, comes not from hate, but from truth . Before you protect others from darkness, you must first be able to protect yourself. Your enemies have the power to render themselves invisible. You must have the ability to fight blind . To see, without seeing . (BOTH G RU NTl NG) (BLOWS LAN Dl NG) (FALLl NG) (COUG H l NG WEAKLY) (PANTl NG) Again . (BOTH G RU NTl NG) Ll NCOLN : ln the weeks that followed, Henry endeavored to impart a lifetime of vampire-hunting secrets. Their ability to adapt to sunlight. Their power to render themselves invisible. But most of all, he taught me how to destroy them. When J udas betrayed Jesus, his reward was 30 pieces of silver. At that moment, those pieces became a symbol of betraying God . Of evil . And silver became a curse upon the cursed. You will never see a vampire with silver on his person . Nor see them reflected in mirrors. The one thing God placed beyond the reach of a vampire. The one thing he can never possess. Ll NCOLN : Barts. STU RG ES: And the only thing that renders him powerless. Henry, Jack Barts ! l give you the targets. That was our deal . This is not only about Jack Barts. Vadoma, a ruthless enforcer. And her brother. l've seen him before. l saw him with Jack Barts. STU RG ES: They call him Adam . He, from whom all others are made. Vampires have been in the New World for centuries. Slaughtering native tribes and early settlers. But when the Europeans arrived with their slaves, the dead saw a sinister opportunity. They built an empire in the South . But, in recent years, they pressed north , leaving death in their wake. lt falls to us, Abraham , the hunters, to keep the balance. To ensure that this remains a nation of men , and not monsters. What we do, we do not for one man , but for the good of all mankind . Ll NCOLN : Henry sent me off into the world with a reminder. No attachments. No distractions. No friends or family. Besides, who could l trust? Anyone in this well-mannered city might very well be one of them. MAN : Son of a bitch ! (G ROANS) l ever see you here again , l will have your balls as a coin purse ! (MAN SHOUTl NG) Good afternoon , sir. Joshua Speed at your service. Abraham . U h , Lincoln . l need a bit of help. All right. Well , a friend in need , is a friend of Speed . What can l get for you? l don't suppose you know of any rooms for rent, Mr. Speed? What sort of room are you looking for, Mr. Lincoln? Well , a cheap one, as l have spent all of my money on law books and have none to spare at the moment. Now, as you say you have none, am l to take your meaning as "cheap" or "free of charge"? Well , on credit. l don't think you'll find such a room in Springfield . People here are strangely accustomed to being compensated . Good day. There is one room , Mr. Lincoln . l was recently forced to part ways with a thieving prick of an associate and am , therefore, in need of a replacement. There's a room upstairs. lt isn't much , but l suppose it could be had on credit, if the tenant were willing to work here in return . Ll NCOLN : Dear Henry, life in Springfield is less than desirous. Fear not. My pittance of a salary doesn't allow me to deviate from your rules. No friends, no family. And certainly, no woman would find me, and my existence, enticing. (BELL CH lMES) Excuse me. Excuse me, l'll be needing these. J ust one second , ma'am . Well , you needn't call me ma'am , as if l'm some haggard spinster. l'm sorry, ma'am .

(CLEARS TH ROAT) How do you feel about keeping slavery out of lllinois? l'm running for the legislature. l'm sure he'd love to hear your campaign speech , but Mr. Lincoln was just about to attend to my list.

A letter came for you . STU RG ES: Dear Abe. Your prescription awaits you at the local pharmacy. Ask for Aaron Stibel, Junior. Mr. Lincoln? l'm so sorry. Good day of work, Abraham . Thank you .

And l would kill again. But no amount of death could make me forget. (WH l N N l ES) Merciful Christ, Lincoln , what happened to your face? Don't worry, l'll still be able to work. Work? To hell with work. We got invited to a ball . lt could be your chance to save Mary Todd from a life of boredom . Ll NCOLN : This suit makes me look ridiculous. Nonsense. But that hat makes you look ridiculous. Come on . Come on , come on . Look, there she is. Mr. Douglas, Joshua Speed . Pleasure to see you . Mary, you look lovely. MAN 1 : He's still missing .

Oh , yes, Stephen . Good to see you . DOUG LAS: Have you heard this news? (CLEARS TH ROAT) NOLAN : Oh , yes. Yes, we're looking into it. Rest assured , this kind of lawlessness won't stand in the noble state of lllinois. (SLOW MUSlC PLAYl NG) lt's called a dance. lf we were meant to sit alone, they would've called it something else. Yes, l suppose they would have. (SlG HS) Come, Mr. Lincoln . You'll ruin the upholstery if you sit there any longer. l'm sure you're a very nice man , Mr. Lincoln , but you're a. . . A shopkeeper, in a borrowed suit. MARY: No, it's not a matter of means. Really, no. l came to Springfield looking for someone different. Someone whose life was a bit more adventurous, and well . . . (CH UCKLES) My apologies, l'm never this. . . Ll NCOLN : Honest? Rude. Miss Todd , may l speak candidly? l , too, came here to better myself. That's why l've taken an interest in the law, and why, if l may be so bold , l have taken an interest in you . And as for the adventure that you seek, l suspect that few men could ever hope to provide that for you . Least of all your fiancé, Stephen Douglas. Mr. Lincoln , you are full of surprises. Miss Todd , you have no idea. STU RG ES: Dear Abraham. l've made a deposit at the local bank. (COUG H l NG) Be careful, it can quickly disappear. (YELLS) (CLATTERl NG) (COUG HS) Ll NCOLN : Henry, there are more than l ever thought possible. Pharmacists, innkeepers, pastors. lt's more than a man can bear.

Do you really want to know the truth , Mary? Each and every night, l go out hunting vampires. Well , how do you hunt these vampires? With an ax. A special silver ax, of course. Of course. And how many would you reckon you've killed? Five. No, six. l have killed six vampires. My goodness ! (LAUG HS) Abe ! Here l thought you were an honest man . Really! (LAUG H l NG) (Ll NCOLN BARKl NG) (LAUG H l NG) Well , l had a wonderful day, Abe. As did l , Mary. Miss Todd , you are a woman of ravishing resourcefulness. Mr. Lincoln , you have no idea. STU RG ES: You will have no friends, no family. l , uh , should be going . lt's late. Ll NCOLN : How could l bring her into this world? A world of demons, of danger. Good night, then , Lincoln . Good night, Mary. Happy hunting . Ll NCOLN : lf l truly cared for her, the kindest thing l could do was walk away. This hunter is another of Henry's disciples? They say he's a madman . l can't wait to meet him . (DOOR OPENS) A stock boy, reading a law book. What? You studying to be a lawyer? As a matter of fact, l am . All right, what about a little test? What's the law for free slaves in the North? According to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1 793, enforcing Article four, section two, of the U nited States Constitution , "All runaway slaves must be returned to their owners." However, personal liberty laws state that "Anyone who is born free "cannot be taken under this act." l heard a good woman once say "U ntil all men are free, "we're all slaves." (SCREAMS) Will? Will Johnson ! How did you . . . ? (LAUG HS) l was back home and heard you moved here. Studying to be a lawyer. That's good . l'm in need of a good lawyer. What, are you in some kind of trouble? l was freeing slaves down South on the railroad , hoping to find my brother down there. Some bounty hunters got after me. Said l was a runaway. l need a writ, Abe, saying l was born free. You know, Will . . . Come on . Hey. Speed , this is Will Johnson . Will Johnson , my oldest friend in the world . The store isn't going to run itself, Abe. l'll have him back as soon as possible, Mr. Speed . l promise. You're getting tall , Abe. Look like you still don't eat much , either. (CH UCKLES) You still afraid of the dark, too? Not so much anymore. (MAN SHOUTS) That's him , Abe. That's the guy that's been chasing me. Gentlemen , gentlemen , gentlemen , l'm sure we can work this out. (G U N COCKl NG) Now l suggest you walk away, son . No, sir, l suggest you do. MARY: l've sent word to Senator Nolan . He'll have you out soon . You're far too kind , Miss Todd . And he's far too ugly to have a woman like you . l think common-looking people are the best in the world . That's why the Lord makes so many of them . l just thank God he was there. Ll NCOLN : But l won't always be there. Mary, what if something was going on , something terrible, and you knew that there was no way on earth that one man could stop it? What would you do? Well , l wouldn't back away from what's right just because it's hard . My father used to say, "Plant your feet and stand firm . "The only question is where to put your feet." We may fail in this fight. We may only shatter the tranquil veil of oppression , but we must not be deterred ! For ours is a just and noble cause. The cause of freedom . The very cause upon which our founding fathers built this great nation ! (CROWD CH EERl NG) (TALKl NG l N DlSTl NCTLY) A voice like that is too strong to be stuck keeping shop. l'm actually studying to be a lawyer. Ah ! Well , Mr. Lincoln , maybe it's time you thought about politics. l can connect you with the right people. Thank you , Senator Nolan . A pleasure young man . The same. You're on your way, Mr. Lincoln . l sent you to Springfield to hunt vampires, not to chase votes. Lesson one, always have a contingency plan . lf vampire hunting doesn't pan out, l need a career to fall back on . l'm being serious. So am l , Henry. l have done everything you've asked of me. Every letter, every name, but never the letter l wait for, and never the name l want most. When do l get to kill Jack Barts? Barts knows about Mary. lt's time. Abraham , be careful .

(STAMMERl NG) lt's nothing . Abe, l know when you're lying . What are you hiding from me? All right. l didn't want to tell you this way. This is not the way that l planned it. But if you really must know, Mary Todd , will you make me the happiest of men? (G lGG LES) And do you , Abraham , promise to love her, comfort her, be honorable and honest with her in all things, in sickness and health , till death do you part? l do. Then by the power vested in me by almighty God , in the great state of lllinois, l now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. (APPLAUSE) Your mother would be so proud . Thank you , Will . l'm happy you could be here. You're the only family l have. Except for this one. Congratulations. May l introduce Mr. Henry Sturges. My wife, Mary. And my dear friend , Will Johnson . Heavens, Mr. Sturges, you're as chilly as the winter wind . Henry, please. l'm afraid that's a hazard of carrying one's own bottle. Well , you know what they say, "Cold hands, warm heart." Yes, but l highly doubt that. (LAUG H l NG) Mr. Sturges is a business associate. Yes, l thought we could talk a little business. Oh , of course. lf you'll excuse me. What the hell are you doing here? Be cautious, Abraham . One forgets how easily we can lose the most precious things. They don't even know who l am . Go upriver. lnvite this Mr. Lincoln to join us at the plantation . We're going to throw a ball in his honor. What makes you think he'll accept? l think we can find a way to tempt him . lt's a good book. lt's good . (G ROANS) Get him ! Abe. We've got a problem . They took Will . What are you going to do? l'm going to accept his invitation . Ll NCOLN : Speed deserved to know the truth of what we were about to face. l told him everything. Not knowing if he would believe me or think me mad. Not knowing if he would have the courage to face the monsters that l had come to know. You and me, Abraham , together we can accomplish anything . Ll NCOLN : There are no slaves. Where are they? l was just wondering that. (l N DlSTl NCT CONVERSATlONS) Something isn't right about this, Abe. Yeah . l don't know how to dance. Don't worry, l'll teach you . Wait here. ADAM: Ladies and gentlemen , dinner is served . (PEOPLE SCREAMl NG) (YELLS) (G ROANS) (VADOMA SCREECH l NG) ADAM: Bravo, Mr. Lincoln . Bravo. You're even better than l'd heard . A shame to sacrifice so many of my best men , but l needed to know if you're up to the task. What do you want with me? To see you liberated . To see you rise up and destroy your oppressor. That's interesting advice, coming from a slave owner. Men have enslaved each other since they invented gods to forgive them for doing it. l've seen Jews build Egypt's glory. (SCREAMl NG) Seen Christians thrown to lions with my own eyes. And l've seen Africans sell their own kind to Europeans. May l share one of the revelations of my 5,000 years? We're all slaves to something . l , to eternity. You , to your convictions. Others, to the color of their skin . All l ever wanted was to see my kind granted their rightful place. But there are those of us, those like your friend Henry, who enjoy living in the dark. And as you're doubtless aware, l cannot personally destroy him , nor he l . You , Mr. Lincoln , you could eliminate those last pockets of resistance, beginning with Henry Sturges himself. All l ask is for you to break your chains. Kill your master. Be free. And if l refuse? Then you go on your merry way. After l make you one of us, and spoon-feed you your friend . Now, a simple "yes" or "no" will suffice. Kill Henry, save your friend . Feel free to take your time to decide. Five, four, three, two, one. (HORSES N ElG H l NG) SPEED: Come on !

(BABY CRl ES) l take it y'all came from up North? Yes, ma'am . Well , l suggest you get back there as fast as you can . There's a war coming . A war for the soul of the country. Going to be all colors of blood spilled . Ll NCOLN : Our nation was built on the backs of slaves. Their labor, their blood. More blood than you could possibly imagine. l have seen this horror of the South firsthand . DOUG LAS: l say the need for peace outweighs the needs of the blacks. l say that if the people of this great nation want slavery, then let them have it. The demon of slavery is tearing our country apart. We must stand up. We must stand strong and fight. Fight for the very soul of our nation . U ntil every man is free, we are all slaves ! You cannot take on slavery, Abraham . You cannot take on the whole South ! Why, because of Adam? No. Are you afraid of him? Because it is the only thing that has kept them sated for all these years, and you take that away, then no one is safe. So you get to choose who lives and who dies. Ll NCOLN : A great man once said , "What we do, we do not for ourselves, "not for one man , but for the good of all mankind ! " Not all mankind , Abraham . MARY: Abe? May l have my husband back? He's all yours, Mrs. Lincoln . Ll NCOLN : Henry only saw the struggle his way. But l began at last to see it another. To see and to feel the even greater issues at stake. So, he and l would go our separate ways. As the Bible says, the time had come for me to put aside childish things. l would fight not with an ax, but with words and ideals. For a time, they proved a stronger weapon. PEOPLE: (CHANTl NG) Lincoln ! Lincoln ! Lincoln ! Ll NCOLN : l appear before you to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the Constitution of the U nited States to be taken by the president before he enters on the execution of this office. The question of slavery is better settled with a pen than with a sword . SOLDl ER: Fire ! (SOLDl ERS YELLl NG) Ll NCOLN : Through twists of fate, l found myself at 50 years of age, the father of a nation that was tearing itself apart while trying to be the father to a boy not much older than l was when l lost my mother. 3, 000 more dead .

There is a way, Abraham . You know that l can restore the dead . MARY: Do it. Do it. Mary. . . Do it! Your journal , the one you always kept in your coat pocket, l know l shouldn't have, Abe, but l needed to know what you were hiding . lf what you say is true, l beg you , Mary, he wouldn't be our little boy. He would be something else, something terrible. Trust me, you don't want that. You're asking me to trust you? After you lied to me for all these years. l did it to protect you , to protect our family. And how did that work out? You did this, Abe ! You did this ! You brought this on him ! You brought this on our boy! (SOBBl NG) Let me go to them . Make a truce with Adam . We must stop this war. Willie's death is just the beginning . Don't you dare say his name. l warned you . You didn't heed me. How many more boys will have to die before you listen to me? SPEED: These boys are dying in vain. We should pull the troops back. Abraham , this war has cost us countless lives, not to mention millions of dollars. l thought we were going to make this country great, not tear it apart. This is the only way we can save the country now, Speed . Send in troops. U nion troops are flooding onto the field . We are now outnumbered and ill-equipped compared to the North .

Fire ! lt's the first day of Gettysburg . lt's been a disaster. l don't think the army can survive another. lf the rebels break through , they'll be here in days. The generals think we should evacuate Washington . Run the war from New York or Boston , if need be. You have to win this war. lf you don't, then all of it. . . Then our son's death will have been for nothing . How can l win a war when l can't even protect my own family? Our men have no way of defending themselves against this enemy. When our bullets are useless, our bayonets are powerless as this fork! This. . . Will ! Speed ! This. This is what we need . A fork. Silver. Okay, okay. How much do we need? All of it. VADOMA: And why tell me this, Mr. Speed? Why betray your friend? SPEED: He is my friend , but l love this country even more. And he, more than anyone, is responsible for tearing this nation apart.

Come, we have a train to catch . lt's 80 miles from here to Gettysburg . Eighty miles will decide whether this nation belongs to the living or the dead . ls everything all right, Speed? l just can't believe you're still writing in that book. lt's all in here, Speed . The good with the bad . What's this? ADAM: They're fleeing the nest. Leaving Washington free for us. Look at me. l said look at me. Leave her. Don't want to miss this train . WOMAN : Let's go. Henry, what the hell are you doing here? l just wanted to see how far your foolishness would take you . l don't have time to argue ! l didn't come here to argue with you . l came here to tell you that your dear friend Speed back there is a traitor.

Bayonets for Springfield muskets. Springfield muskets ! Five-pounders and grenades are in the second wagon in the back. Go now, go now. (LOW G ROWLl NG) (YELLl NG) Fire ! (l NAU Dl BLE) Ll NCOLN : Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. lt is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced . lt is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion , that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain , and that this nation , under God , shall have a new birth of freedom , and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth . (ALL CH EERl NG) (PEOPLE CLAMORl NG) Our enemies have made their exodus. Some back to Europe, some to South America and the Orient. They've seen that America shall forever be a nation of living men, a nation of free men. STU RG ES: We make rather a good team , you and l . One can't help but think of all the good we could do if we had more time. Limitless time. MARY: Lincoln ! Yes, well , time waits for no man . We're going to be late for the theater. Hold onto this for me, Henry. Mary, darling , have you seen my hat? lt's on your desk in the office. Have you seen my hat? Abraham , let me make you immortal . Let us fight through the ages, side by side. Vampires are not the only things that live forever. (CH UCKLES) Ll NCOLN : History prefers legends to men. lt prefers nobility to brutality. Soaring speeches to quiet deeds. History remembers the battle and forgets the blood. However history remembers me, if it does at all, it shall only remember a fraction of the truth.
