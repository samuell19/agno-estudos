[ ROARING ] [ WOMAN SINGING OPERA ] [ APPLAUSE ] [ BELL RINGS ] Man: YOU'RE ALL TERRIFIC. YOU HAVE A GREAT GIFT FOR IMPROVISATION. YOU THINK I'M THAT GOOD? I GOT A GIG -- JAZZ ON THIRD IN NEW YORK CITY. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO TURN MY TRIO INTO A QUARTET? YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS. ONE MONTH. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU CAN BACK OUT. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S LEAVING TOWN, AND YOU CAN HAVE HIS PLACE IN THE VILLAGE. I'D LOVE TO. BUT YOU GOT PLANS. I'M GOING TO JAPAN WITH MY FATHER. JAPAN? [ CHUCKLES ] [ PLAYS PIANO ] I'LL TALK TO YOUR FATHER. NO. HERE. TO REMIND YOU OF A BRILLIANT CAREER CUT SHORT BY A TRAGIC ADDICTION TO SIGHTSEEING. KATHY, HOW IS THE CONSERVATORY? THE SEMESTER ENDS FRIDAY. KATHY ONLY HAS TWO WEEKS TO GET HER WARDROBE TOGETHER BEFORE OUR TRIP. YOU TWO BETTER GET TO IT. GREAT. SAY WHEN. YOU KNOW HOW I LOVE SHOPPING. WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU, KATHY? THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. DO YOU KNOW THE IMPROV CLASS I'M TAKING NOW? WELL, THERE'S A SPECIAL ONE-MONTH MASTER CLASS GOING ON IN NEW YORK. AND I'VE WON A SCHOLARSHIP. AND WE'D BE GIVING PUBLIC PERFORMANCES. Woman: KATHY, THAT'S JUST TERRIFIC! WHEN DOES THIS START? NEXT WEEK. BEN GARDNER, IF YOU DON'T LET KATHY GO, YOU'RE AN EVEN BIGGER KILLJOY THAN I THINK YOU ARE. SHE'S AN ADULT. I'M SURE SHE'LL DO WHATEVER SUITS HER. [ OPERA MUSIC PLAYS ] I'LL BELIEVE THAT WHEN I HEAR SHE'S GOING TO NEW YORK. MARTIN! I WAS SEARCHING FOR YOUR LEGENDARY TACT AND GRACE. WELL, MY GOD, SHE FINALLY DARES TO CONTRADICT THE GREAT MAN. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? CLAIRE, YOU'LL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE. INTERFERING DOESN'T HELP. IT DIDN'T HELP HER MOTHER AND IT WON'T HELP HER. I'M SORRY. I HAVE NO REGRETS ABOUT THAT. HE BRUTALIZED THAT POOR WOMAN. OH, CLAIRE. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT WOMAN'S DEATH. WELL, IF HE HADN'T BEEN SO POSSESSIVE, SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE PLAYED AROUND. AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE THROWN HER OUT, AND SHE WOULDN'T HAVE GOT DRUNK AND HAD THAT ACCIDENT. [ Chuckling ] OH, OH! AND IF YOU WERE A LAWYER, THEY'D MAKE YOU A JUDGE, AND YOU'D HANG HALF THE MEN IN AMERICA. LOOK, KATHY'S NOT HER MOTHER. SHE SEEMS HAPPY TO ME. THAT'S BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW BETTER. GOOD NIGHT. WE HAVEN'T BEEN TO JAPAN IN A LONG TIME. I'D LIKE TO GO WITH YOU... IF I STILL CAN. OF COURSE YOU CAN. Good night. KATHY... I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT YOUR MUSIC IS TO YOU. LET'S FORGET ABOUT JAPAN. THEN I CAN GO NEXT WEEK? I'LL EVEN COME UP FOR YOUR FIRST PERFORMANCE. DADDY... THANK YOU. [ CHILDREN'S CHOIR SINGING ] [ MUFFLED WHISPERING ] [ PANTING ] [ BABY CRYING IN DISTANCE ] Man: HELLO. I'M LOOKING FOR MAGGIE. THE DOOR WAS OPEN. OH, UM, I DON'T KNOW MAGGIE. SHE WAS LIVING HERE LAST MONTH. DID SHE SAY WHERE SHE WENT? NO, I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF HER. I'M SUBLETTING FROM GARY. GARY? DO YOU KNOW HIM? HE'S A DRUMMER. NO. [ CHUCKLES ] WELL, MAYBE MAGGIE WAS SUBLETTING FROM GARY, TOO. WELL, MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU AROUND SOMETIME. HERE. NO. TAKE IT. THANK YOU. UH... [ Chuckling ] I GOT IT. BYE. [ JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS ] [ APPLAUSE ] Man: YOU GOT SOME BIG SOUND, KIDDO. Man #2: REALLY BLEW MY MIND WITH THOSE CHANGES. I'LL HELP WITH THE DISHES. THERE'S NOT MUCH. WELL, IT WON'T TAKE LONG, THEN. YOU WASH, I'LL WIPE. HERE, CATCH. WHEN I SAY, "THROW IT," YOU THROW IT, ALL RIGHT? Okay... THROW! [ CUPS SHATTER ] DARN. MY FATHER'S COMING FOR BREAKFAST. YOU HAVE TO GO. SOMEDAY YOUR FATHER'S GONNA HAVE TO FIND OUT YOU'RE A WOMAN. NO, NOT TODAY. UH, I HAD A LOVELY EVENING. [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ TAPPING ON WINDOW ] WE SHOULD BE LIVING TOGETHER. [ JINGLING ] [ FOOTSTEPS ] [ SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE ] [ FAUCET DRIPPING ] [ GRUNTS ] [ GASPS ] MAGGIE GAVE ME THESE. I don't wanna fuck you. Just tell me the truth. Where's Maggie? WHERE'S MAGGIE?! I don't know. YOU KNOW... ...THERE'S OVER 100 TORTURES IN THE AVERAGE LIVING ROOM. NOW... ALL I'D HAVE TO DO... IS PUT THIS... WHERE IT HURTS MOST. YOU'LL TELL ME ANYTHING I WANNA KNOW. WHERE'S MAGGIE? WHERE'S MAGGIE?! [ Sobbing ] I DON'T KNOW. AAAAH! AAAAAAAH! [ GRUNTS ] DID HE HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH YOU? IF HE DIDN'T MOLEST YOU, THEN WHY IS THERE FRESH SEMEN IN THE BED? I'M BEN GARDNER, KATHY'S FATHER. I'M SURE SHE'LL DO EVERYTHING SHE CAN TO OBLIGE. IF WE CAN JUST HAVE A MOMENT ALONE, MAYBE SHE CAN PULL HERSELF TOGETHER. DID THEY READ YOU YOUR RIGHTS? NOW LISTEN. WE HAVE A SERIOUS, SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE. AND IF YOU TELL THE POLICE WHAT YOU TOLD ME ON THE PHONE, IT WON'T GO AWAY. IF YOU ADMIT TO THE POLICE THAT YOU STABBED A BLINDED, UNARMED MAN IN THE BACK, THEY MIGHT NOT FEEL THAT YOU ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING? [ Voice breaking ] IT WASN'T IN SELF-DEFENSE. WHEN THEY ASK YOU WHAT HAPPENED, I WANT YOU TO LIE FOR ME. I WANT YOU TO TELL THEM THE WHOLE STORY, UNTIL YOU RAN INTO THE KITCHEN, AND THEN EVERYTHING WENT BLACK. AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNEW, YOU WERE STANDING OVER HIM WITH A KNIFE. WILL YOU SAY THAT FOR ME, KATHY? [ Sobbing ] HE WAS COMING AFTER ME IN THE KITCHEN... ...AND THEN I... I HAD THE KNIFE AND EVERYTHING WENT BLACK. OKAY! THAT'S GOOD. SAY THAT. THAT'S PERFECT. IT WASN'T LIKE THAT! SAY IT. SAY IT JUST LIKE THAT. Kathy: THEN HE WENT OVER TO THE GREEN LAMP. THEN HE RIPPED OUT THE CORD. AND THEN I RAN AWAY FROM HIM INTO THE KITCHEN. AND -- AND HE RAN AFTER ME. Woman: AND THEN? AND THEN EVERYTHING WAS BLACK, AND I WAS S-STANDING OVER HIM WITH, UH, WITH THE KNIFE. [ INDISTINCT TALKING ON POLICE RADIO ] [ DIALING ] [ In distance ] HELLO? COULD YOU HAVE A CAR MEET ME AT THE FIRST SHUTTLE? YES, AND SEE THAT KATHY'S ROOM IS MADE UP, WILL YOU? NO, SHE HAD A BIT OF A SHAKE-UP, BUT SHE'S FINE. A BOY WAS ATTACKED IN HER APARTMENT BUILDING. NO, NO, HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. OH, AND KATHY AND I WILL BE GOING TO JAPAN AFTER ALL. THANK YOU. [ HANGS UP ] I SHOULD CALL KEVIN. [ DIALING ] [ In distance ] KEVIN. I'M FINE. ME TOO. Goodbye. I MADE A COMMITMENT. [ PLAYS "THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME" ] [ SIREN WAILING ] [ FAUCET DRIPPING ] NO! What happened? Woman on television: PERHAPS AND PERHAPS NOT. THE CHOICE IS YOURS, IVANHOE -- NOT MINE AND NOT REBECCA'S. DO YOU THINK I GO TO HER AID BECAUSE I LOVE HER? I SHALL KNOW THAT WHEN... [ FAUCET DRIPPING ] Man: THERE'S OVER 100 TORTURES IN THE AVERAGE LIVING ROOM. [ GASPS ] ...AND I AM JEALOUS. GO AND FREE HER. [ ROCK MUSIC BLARING ] WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY? HE TOLD ME I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE DREAMS TO GO AWAY. THAT'S ALL? HE SEEMED TO THINK BARBITURATES WOULD HELP, BUT HE WOULDN'T GIVE ME ANY. PRICK. AND THEN HE MENTIONED SOME SLEEP CENTER. OH, WHAT DO THEY DO? I DON'T KNOW. WHY WOULDN'T HE GIVE YOU THE PILLS? HE TOLD ME THEY WERE ADDICTIVE. THEY'D HELP STOP THE DREAMING, AND AS SOON AS I GOT OFF THEM, THE NIGHTMARES WOULD COME BACK WORSE. BARBITURATES ARE LIKE ANY OTHER DRUGS. THEY GOTTA BE TREATED WITH RESPECT, THAT'S ALL. [ SIGHS ] I THINK THIS IS A JOB FOR "CAN-DO McCANN." [ FAUCET DRIPPING ] AAAAH! AAAAH! AAAAH! [ GRUNTS ] [ GASPS ] [ CRYING ] MISS GARDNER? YOU CAN GO IN NOW. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE NOT A TREATMENT FACILITY. WHAT WE ARE IS A SLEEP-RESEARCH FACILITY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE HERE TO VOLUNTEER. I'M SORRY. WHAT IF THE NIGHTMARES DON'T GO AWAY? IF THE NIGHTMARES DON'T GO AWAY, I THINK YOU SHOULD SEE A PSYCHIATRIST. I COULD RECOMMEND A GOOD PSYCHIATRIST. AFTER THREE YEARS OF TALKING, I CAN GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP? YOU'LL BE FINE. DAMN THING WEIGHS A TON. DO US BOTH A FAVOR NEXT TIME AND GET IT FROM STORES. THE BARON THANKS YOU, JENNIFER. SIGN THIS. I DO SPECIAL RESEARCH HERE. I HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM A RECURRING NIGHTMARE. WAS IT TRIGGERED BY RECENT TRAUMA? I WAS IN MY APARTMENT... AND... ...THERE WAS A MAN HIDING WITH A KNIFE. DID HE CAUSE YOU ANY PHYSICAL HARM? NO. I'M NOT A CLINICIAN. I WORK ON CATS, NOT PEOPLE. THE RULES ARE VERY STRICT ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO WITH HUMAN SUBJECTS. WE NEED PRIOR APPROVAL FROM A REVIEW BOARD EVEN TO GIVE YOU A QUESTIONNAIRE. I THINK MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU. Okay. THIS IS MY LAB. I GUESS IT'S OBVIOUS. IN THIS ROOM... I KEEP TRACK OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT ROOM. YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE, SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT YOUR DREAM LIFE IS DISTURBED, THAT YOU'RE HAVING NIGHTMARES. BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO. BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP, YOU RECOUNT YOUR ENTIRE DREAM ALOUD IN PRECISE DETAIL. AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE, YOU STAY AWAKE FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES, THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. THEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES, AND YOU RECOUNT THE DREAM AGAIN. ONLY THIS TIME YOU STOP AT A POINT WHERE YOU WANNA WAKE UP, AND WHERE IT'S SAFE FOR YOU TO WAKE UP. THEN WHAT HAPPENS? WELL, IF ALL GOES WELL, WHEN YOU DO FALL ASLEEP, THE NIGHTMARE WILL END AT THE POINT YOU PICKED. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. IT'S POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO IT AT HOME, BUT I'D REALLY LIKE FOR YOU TO TRY IT HERE. I'D LIKE TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU. I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING. THESE WIRES PICK UP TINY ELECTRICAL IMPULSES, AND THEY TRANSMIT THEM TO THE POLYGRAPH HERE. SO I CAN LOOK DOWN ON THIS SHEET, AND I CAN TELL WHAT YOUR HEART RATE IS, HOW YOU'RE BREATHING. SO IF YOU DID GET INTO TROUBLE, I COULD WAKE YOU UP. YOU CAN PUT THESE ON, IF YOU LIKE. WHAT'S THAT? IT'S AN INFRARED LAMP. IT LETS THE CAMERA SEE IN THE DARK. All right. I'M SCARED. DO YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF SLEEP RITUAL, LIKE SOMETHING YOU USED TO DO AS A KID, MAYBE, THAT YOU USED TO FIND SOOTHING? WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS, YOU KNOW. THERE IS SOMETHING MY FATHER USED TO DO. HE USED TO TAKE HIS HAND... AND HE'D... SAY, "MAGIC CIRCLE... [ Voice breaking ] ..."SAFE AND SOUND... till the morning sun comes around, comes around." [ CHUCKLES ] MAGIC CIRCLE... SAFE AND SOUND... TILL THE MORNING SUN COMES AROUND. Kathy: I'M SLEEPING ON MY BACK... AND I HEAR A NOISE. MY EYES POP OPEN. I GET OUT OF BED, AND GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND TURN THE LIGHTS ON. AND I GO TO THE FRIDGE AND GET SOME MILK OUT. AND THAT'S WHEN I WAKE UP. [ SIREN WAILING ] [ FAUCET DRIPPING ] Thank you. [ LAUGHS ] WHAT YOU DID LAST NIGHT WAS FANTASTIC. I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING. HERE YOU ENTER STAGE-ONE SLEEP. YOUR BRAIN SLOWS WAY DOWN. YOU'RE DEAD TO THE WORLD. NOW, LOOK AT THIS. HERE YOU GO UNDER DREAM SLEEP. SEE HOW YOUR BRAIN SPEEDS UP? YOUR MIND ISN'T RESTING AT ALL. IT'S EXTREMELY ACTIVE, WORKING OVERTIME, CREATING YOUR DREAM WORLD. YOUR EYES, THEY'RE DARTING BACK AND FORTH JUST LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING. WHEN YOU DREAM, YOUR BRAIN TELLS YOUR BODY TO DO THINGS, JUST LIKE IT DOES WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE, BUT LOOK AT THIS. YOUR MUSCLES GO COMPLETELY SLACK BECAUSE WHEN YOU DREAM, YOU'RE COMPLETELY PARALYZED. IF I DREAM THAT I'M TOUCHING YOUR HAIR, FOR INSTANCE, MY BRAIN IS ACTUALLY SENDING SIGNALS TO MY ARM THEY WAY IT DOES AS IF I'M REALLY TOUCHING YOUR HAIR. BUT SINCE IT'S A DREAM, MY BRAIN ALSO SECRETES A CHEMICAL WHICH STOPS THOSE SIGNALS FROM REACHING MY ARM. AND IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT CHEMICAL, WE'D BE RUNNING AROUND ALL NIGHT, ACTING OUT OUR DREAMS, GETTING INTO TROUBLE -- NOT GOOD FOR SURVIVAL OF THE SPECIES. NOW, WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR NIGHTMARE THAT SEEMED SO VIVID TO YOU, I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE, RARE PEOPLE, WHO AREN'T TOTALLY PARALYZED WHEN THEY DREAM. SO I PUT SOME EXTRA ELECTRODES ON TO SEE IF SOME OF THE BRAIN SIGNALS LEAD TO THE MUSCLE. LOOK. I THINK I CAN PRACTICALLY READ YOUR DREAM. HERE'S YOUR EAR. YOU HEARD A NOISE. YOUR EYES MOVED. YOU DREAMT YOU WOKE UP. AND YOUR LEGS -- YOU WALKED ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT STEPS. THERE'S YOUR ARM. YOU TOUCHED SOMETHING. YOU TURNED ON A LIGHT. THE KITCHEN LIGHT. YOU WALKED ANOTHER SIX STEPS, YOU TOUCHED SOMETHING ELSE. THE GREEN LAMP. YOU WALKED ANOTHER SIX STEPS. YOU TOUCHED SOMETHING ELSE. THE FRIDGE. THEN YOU WOKE UP. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS... EXCEPT, OF COURSE, FOR THE BARON. NOW WATCH THIS. THIS WAS TWO WEEKS AGO. HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S AWAKE, BUT HE'S SOUND ASLEEP. HE'S ACTING OUT A DREAM. SEE, ONE INJECTION OF PCPA, AND THE SIGNALS TO MOVE HIS MUSCLES AREN'T STOPPED AT THE BRAIN AND HIS BODY IS NO LONGER PARALYZED. MILLIONS OF YEARS OF EVOLUTIONARY PROGRAMMING FALL AWAY. ALL THOSE GREAT REASONS HIS ANCESTORS HAD FOR NOT RUNNING AROUND IN THEIR SLEEP DISAPPEAR. IS THIS YOUR DISCOVERY? IF IT WERE MY DISCOVERY, DO YOU THINK I'D BE IN TWO ROOMS IN A BASEMENT? I'M DUPLICATING SOMEONE ELSE'S WORK, CONFIRMING THEIR DATA. IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO FIND THE BARON. HE'S ONE IN 1,000. BUT YOU'RE ONE IN 10,000. DO YOU WANT ME TO COME BACK AND TRY SOME MORE? NO. I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE WHAT I DID LAST NIGHT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME. HANSEN -- MICHAEL HANSEN. DOCTOR. I'M KATHY GARDNER. * DA DA DA-DA DA DA-DA * * DA DA-DA DA-DA UN DA * * BA DA DA-DA DA * * BADUBADABA-HMM-HA * [ APPLAUSE ] YOU GET TO LONDON, I'LL SUPPLY THE RECORDING TIME. IF I LIKE WHAT WE GET, I'LL HELP YOU SET UP A TOUR. WHEN DO WE START? I HAVE STUDIO SPACE FOR FIVE NIGHTS, STARTING MONDAY. WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF THIS GIG. WELL, CAN YOU DO IT? OH, WE SURE CAN. MONDAY, THEN. SEE YOU IN LONDON. BREAK OUT THE CHAMPAGNE, LEN! OKAY -- FIRST, THE ALBUM. THEN, THE TOUR. NOT JUST LONDON -- PARIS, ROME, TOKYO. WHO KNOWS? AND WE MAY NEVER BE COMING BACK. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR... FIVE, SIX, SEVEN... EIGHT. [ Sighs ] I'M SLEEPING ON MY BACK. I HEAR A NOISE. I GET OUT OF BED. [ SIREN WAILING ] [ FAUCET DRIPPING ] [ GRUNTING ] KATHY! KATHY! DID ANYTHING HAPPEN THAT MIGHT HAVE AFFECTED YOUR PROCEDURE? I DON'T KNOW. LOOK, I'M NO SHRINK. I'LL ARRANGE FOR YOU TO SEE SOMEONE. NO. I HAVE TO LEAVE FOR LONDON ON MONDAY. YOU CAN'T. I HAVE TO. WHY? THERE'S THIS BIG RECORD PRODUCER. HIS NAME IS VAUGHN CAPISI. VAUGHN CAPISI? AND IT'S KEVIN'S BIG CHANCE. DO YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY? YOU HELPED ME ONCE. Can you do it again? LAST TIME I TAUGHT YOU TO WAKE UP FROM THE NIGHTMARE. MAYBE THAT WASN'T ENOUGH. NOW I'M GONNA TEACH TO CHANGE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE DREAM. Kathy: SO I RECOUNT MY DREAM JUST LIKE I DID BEFORE? YOU WAIT 10 MINUTES AND TELL IT TO YOURSELF AGAIN, THIS TIME WITH THE CHANGES YOU WANT TO MAKE. WHEN HE GRABS ME BY THE THROAT, I TAKE HIS HAND AND I THROW HIM DOWN TO THE GROUND AND THEN I RUN OUT THE DOOR AND THEN I KNOW I'M SAFE. WHEN I SEE THAT HE'S GRABBED YOU BY THE THROAT, I'LL BUZZ YOU THROUGH THE INTERCOM, AND THAT WILL REMIND YOU TO CHANGE YOUR DREAM. [ POLYGRAPH RATTLING ] [ SUSTAINED INTERCOM BEEP ] [ GRUNTS ] [ GIGGLE ] [ GIGGLING ] AAAH! AAAAAH! AAAHHAAHHHH! [ GRUNTING ] Shh. Shh. [ CRYING ] Shh. All right. LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] TALK TO ME ABOUT THE DREAM. THERE WAS A POINT -- THERE WAS A POINT THERE JUST AFTER I PUSHED THE SIGNAL BUTTON WHEN YOU WERE IN CONTROL, WASN'T THERE? WASN'T THERE? KATHY... CAN YOU TRY AGAIN? WOULD IT HELP...TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE REAL ATTACK? I STABBED HIM! HE DROPPED HIS KNIFE! HE DROPPED HIS KNIFE, SO I PICKED IT UP, AND I STABBED HIM!! I STABBED HIM! THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED! THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED! [ CRYING ] AND I-I NEVER FELT SO GOOD AS WHEN I STUCK THAT KNIFE IN HIM! [ GRUNTS ] [ Crying ] OH, GOD! Shh. WELCOME TO THE HUMAN RACE. WE'LL ALL ATTACK IF WE'RE CORNERED. AND WHEN WE DO, WE'RE WIRED TO GET A RUSH. IT'S A PSYCHODRENAL RUSH. IF WE DIDN'T, WE'D BE FOSSILS BY NOW. IT ALMOST WORKED, DIDN'T IT? [ SIGHS ] LET'S TRY AGAIN. [ POLYGRAPH RATTLING ] [ BEEPING ] [ FAUCET DRIPPING ] [ GRUNTS ] MARTIN, HOW'S DAD? THERE'S SOMETHING HE OUGHT TO KNOW -- I'VE GOT A RECORD DEAL, AND I'M GONNA BE RECORDING IN LONDON. SO I THOUGHT I'D FLY DOWN THERE THIS AFTERNOON. I CAN'T LEAVE HIM WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE. THANK YOU. [ TELEPHONE CLICKS ] DID I HEAR YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO WASHINGTON? MM-HMM. I'LL GO DOWN THERE FOR THE NIGHT, AND THEN I'LL MEET YOU AT THE AIRPORT IN THE MORNING. YOU'RE CUTTING IT A BIT THIN, DON'T YOU THINK? NO, I'LL LEAVE IN PLENTY OF TIME. THAT'S IF YOU WANT TO CATCH THE PLANE. I'LL GO WITH YOU. [ WATER GURGLES ] IT'LL BE HARD ENOUGH ALONE. I BOUGHT THESE FOR DAD. THEY'RE HIS FAVORITE CIGARS. WISH ME LUCK. MAKE SURE HE READS THE CARD. [ DOOR OPENS ] [ SIGHS ] OH, BEN. [ DOOR OPENS ] I'M SORRY. [ BEEP ] Ben: Susan, will you come in here, please? [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ] WHAT IF HE NEVER FORGIVES ME? GIVE HIM TIME. IS THAT WHAT YOU TOLD MY MOTHER? [ DOOR UNLOCKS ] Kevin: KATHY! I WANTED TO...SAY GOODBYE. I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME. NO, PLEASE. UH... COME ON IN. [ DOOR CLOSES ] WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? DO YOU REMEMBER THAT INJECTION... THAT I GAVE THE BARON TO MAKE HIM ACT OUT HIS DREAMS? YOU GAVE IT TO YOURSELF? I COULD BE ACTING OUT A DREAM... RIGHT NOW. AND...YOU'RE DREAMING... THAT I'VE COME BACK. I'M AWAKE. ARE YOU OKAY? I'M FINE. IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME I'VE TRIED IT. [ LAUGHS ] HAVE YOU ACTED OUT A DREAM? NO, NOT YET... UNLESS IT WORKED TONIGHT. LET ME FIND WHERE I WAS DREAMING. LOOK AT THAT -- I WAS DREAMING. YOU JUST TURNED OVER IN YOUR SLEEP. BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN DREAM SLEEP. IN DREAM SLEEP, YOU'RE COMPLETELY PARALYZED. BUT YOU DID IT. IT WORKS. I HAD THE DREAM 15 MINUTES AGO, AND I CAN'T REMEMBER A GODDAMN THING. YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP THE MINUTE YOU STOP DREAMING, OR IT WON'T STAY IN YOUR MIND. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A TIMER TO WAKE ME UP, BUT THE GODDAMN THING DOESN'T KNOW WHEN TO WAKE ME UP. WELL, I'LL BE YOUR TIMER. I'LL -- I'LL WAKE YOU UP AS SOON AS YOU STOP DREAMING. [ SIGHS ] [ POLYGRAPH RATTLING ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Restoring the block. It's no use. No matter how hard I try, I just don't have strong-enough dreams. And if this is going to work, it's got to be with someone who has dreams powerful enough to break the paralysis. LIKE MY NIGHTMARES? I didn't mean you. Michael... we're doing this backwards. You should be out here, and I should be in there. If it's safe for you, it's safe for me. THIS IS TOTALLY NEW GROUND. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE RISKS ARE. THE EXPERIMENT IS NOT APPROVED FOR HUMAN BEINGS. How long before it is? And when it is, do you think you're going to be the first person allowed to try it? I HAVE A REQUEST IN, AS A MATTER OF FACT. They're never going to let you be the first. And you know that. Why don't you let me do it? [ POLYGRAPH RATTLING ] I TRUST YOU. [ SIREN WAILING ] [ FAUCET DRIPPING ] I couldn't do it. [ POLYGRAPH RATTLING ] MICHAEL, I'M SORRY. MICHAEL... [ CAMERA MOTOR WHIRRING ] [ CLICKING ] MICHAEL... MICHAEL... [ FABRIC TEARS ] [ CAMERA MOTOR WHIRS ] Kathy? [ CAMERA MOTOR WHIRS ] KATHY? WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP IT? ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS WAKE ME UP! [ FOOTSTEPS ] [ DOOR SLAMS ] KENNEDY AIRPORT. I DIDN'T RESTORE THE BLOCK. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] MNH! I ONLY HAVE TWO ROOMS. YOU SHARE WITH THE LADY. YOU'LL FIND IT HARD TO FIND A PLACE TO SLEEP IN LONDON, WITH THE FLOWER SHOW AND ALL. NOW, THE BATHROOM'S AT THE END OF THE HALL, NEXT TO THE LOO. A HOT BATH IS 73 PENCE. [ CHILDREN'S CHOIR SINGING ] Man: DEBBIE? THAT WAS A LOAN. I'M GONNA PAY HIM BACK FROM MY ROYALTIES. WILL YOU JUST PUT HIM ON? THANKS. HE DIDN'T GIVE ME THE OTHER INJECTION. ARE YOU SURE THERE'S NO ANSWER AT THAT NUMBER? Woman: I've already tried three times, Miss. I'D LIKE TO TRY ANOTHER NUMBER. Yes, Miss? IT'S AREA CODE 202... 547-9982. MAKE IT A COLLECT CALL FROM KATHY GARDNER... TO BEN GARDNER. Woman: WILL ALL ARRIVING PASSENGERS ON BRITISH AIR FLIGHT 410 FROM NEW YORK CITY NOW WISHING TO CLEAR CUSTOMS IN ENGLAND KINDLY PROCEED DIRECTLY TO THE IMMIGRATION AREA. The number's now ringing. [ Ringing ] Woman: Hello? I have a collect overseas call to Mr. Ben Gardner from Kathy Gardner. Will you accept? Yes, I will. Kathy, your father's in London, and he wants to see you.

[ CHAIN UNLOCKS ] BEFORE YOU MET THIS MICHAEL HANSEN, YOU SAY YOU SAW A REAL DOCTOR? AND HE SUGGESTED BARBITURATES? HE TOLD ME THEY'D HELP STOP...THE DREAMING, BUT THEY WOULD BE ADDICTIVE. LISTEN TO ME -- I'LL GO OUT AND GET THE PILLS. THEY'LL BUY US TIME. WHEN WE GET BACK TO WASHINGTON, I CAN UNRAVEL THIS WHOLE MESS. I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. [ DOOR CLOSES ] I MEAN, I'M HERE AT THE AIRPORT. IS SHE THERE? Man: She's with her father. DAMN IT. DID SHE SAY WHAT FLIGHT SHE WAS ON? No. He's in the London Hilton. I WILL DREAM...A GENTLE DREAM -- A SOFT DREAM. I AM AT PEACE IN THIS DREAM. I AM SAFE. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Ben: KATHY! [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] KATHY! KATHY, OPEN THE DOOR!
