I have to babysit tomorrow. I hope she cancels, I hate that baby, he's so fat. He's really hard to carry and it makes my wrists swell up. They live on the third floor and I have to carry this fat baby. Have you seen Max? Yeah, he's here. He weighs like 25 pounds already. And this mom keeps nagging, "How's the baby? How's the baby?" How's the baby? He's fat! So he started choking Daria. It was terrifying. And Nadav was k-holing bad, so he was like unable to connect emotionally to the situation. Like he was really high, but his "inner Nadav" registered that he was supposed to react, so he just shoved him off of Daria. Danny, don't you want a drink? No thanks, I'm pregnant. Seriously? Yeah, I took a test today and I'm pregnant. What, but like, are you okay? Do you know what you want to do? Yes. It's all good. Chill out. What's your deal? Should I bring you a chair or something to sit on? It's all good. I'll get an abortion sometime this week. Listen, I was also pregnant once, it's not a huge deal. What? You never told me. Yeah. Listen, don't take the pills. I mean, you can, but you shouldn't. One day I felt like shit, so I went to get a pregnancy test. Although I figured there's zero chance, 'cause of my polycystic ovaries. I woke up with the strongest craving for bread and butter. And I'm walking around dizzy and exhausted, but I never thought it could be that. And then, when it was positive, I was super confused and my boyfriend wanted to keep it. And I'm like, in theory I want it too, someday. But oh my god, not now! Like, help! Then again, if there's already a baby, maybe like, yes? So the next day I called up a gynecologist in private practice-- otherwise, you won't get an appointment before your kid's eight. So he examined me, did an ultrasound, told me I was at week seven and you can see the fetus. I mean, at seven weeks you can't see arms or legs, but you can see that bean shape, like it becomes real. Then I had to face a panel, three people behind a desk, in a tiny room, like a parent-teacher meeting. So, the social worker's job is to see if you really want to abort or if someone's pressuring you, see what the deal is. She read my case thoroughly, asked a million questions, it was irritating as hell. There were two old lady doctors, they were cool. Anyways, they're like, "Congrats! You're next in line for an abortion!" I took the first pill. All good. Three days later, I was gonna take the second pill. I sat there at the clinic for like two hours, really wanting it to happen already, but also dreading it. There's morning shows on TV, and I'm listening and not listening, like I hear it but I'm tuning everything out. Then I'm inside the ward, they give me the pill, then the cramps, they're like PMS but way, way worse. I curled up for like 3 hours, it was awful. And then you start bleeding. They give you a giant maxi pad you change every 15 minutes. At some point I just squatted over the toilet and let it flow. Although, after the second pill... you stop feeling nauseous, or dizzy, yeah? Then you bleed, like normal period style, for 3 weeks. There's also curettage, which involves anesthesia. But you show up, go under and it's done all at once, got it? In the moment, it seems terrifying, but looking back it's all chill. I mostly remember the physical pain, feeling really sick, like I need a tumor removed. And I was really sick! I was bedridden, all nauseous and puking. Anyways, you can talk to me. I got it done at Ramat Aviv Mall, third floor. At the mall, amazing. I'm off to get an abortion, anyone need anything? When did this happen? Was it a while ago? She would've been about a year old by now. I don't know why I said "she." Okay. Thanks, babe. I'm gonna look for Max. See you. How's it going, Noa? Give me a hug. Have you seen Max? Who is Max? Noa! Noa! Wait here. I love you. Wait here, okay? Danny! Come in! Honey, wanna do a line? We're just hiding here. I don't have enough to share. - Wanna do a line? It's CK. - No, thanks. - Have you seen Max? - I think so. You want in? We're just about to order. - You got a 100? - No. Where have you seen him? Not sure, it was a while ago. How about 50? You can do 50. - You can do 50. - I'm cool with that. No, no thanks. So, I was stalking Ido on his Netflix account after we broke up. I called him, and said "Have you seen the new Noah Baumbach?" "Why did you stop after 88 minutes?" and he was like, "What? Because I got bored." So I was like, "Why did it take you 88 minutes to figure that out?" Hi. Can I join you guys for 50? - Of course. - Sure, no problem. Danny... - Are you okay? - Yes, of course. - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. - Do you need any help with anything? - No, it's all good. - Let me know if you need anything. - Totally. - For real though. - Thank you. Do you hate me? You hate me? You hate me? I am my mama's son, my mama's son I ate off her plate and now she hates me She hates me, she hates me She hates me, she hates me She hates me, she hates me She hates me, she hates me She hates me, she hates me And I broke the nose of her statue Her statue, now it's broken Now you're crying, I lied, I lied, I lied, I lied I told a joke, and now you're crying And now you're crying and now you're crying, And now you're crying And now you're crying! I eat, masturbate and sleep You didn't say no, you didn't say yes And now you're crying And now you're crying My mama's son, I'm a son of a bitch And now you're crying, and now you're crying I've lent and repented and apologized And now you're crying I talked trash about you, and walked all over you Watched your struggle and did nothing And you apologized, and I didn't accept it I projected, projected, shamed you, and wrote you a song I'm a fat white rich boy A fat white rich boy I shamed you and wrote you a song I'm a fat white rich boy A fat white rich boy, a fat white rich boy I shamed you, and wrote you a song I'm a white boy, fat and rich A fat white rich boy I shamed you, and wrote you a song I'm a white boy Fat and rich I shamed you and wrote you a song A fat white rich boy Fat white rich boy I shamed you, and wrote you a song A fat white rich boy A fat white rich boy I shamed you, and wrote you a song... Danny, how's it going? - Do you know Avishag? - Hey, what's up? Yeah, we met briefly. - How are you? - I'm good. - Max, could I borrow you real quick? - Yeah, sure. - What's up? - All good. Are you two together? I had no idea. No, we're not together. Not really. We've been liking each other's posts on Instagram for a while, and then we randomly ran into each other here and vibed. - Let's see what happens. - Cool. - She seems great. - Yeah. We'll see what happens. - Did you just get here? - Yeah, not too long ago. On my way over, I saw a dying butterfly on the sidewalk, and I thought, how come we don't call the vet? Why would we call for a dying horse, but not a butterfly? Like who decides which animal matters more? I'm not following. - Never mind, it's stupid. - Okay. Okay. - So, is it going well for you two? - I told you, it just started. But it feels good. We were talking about driving to Sinai for the weekend. We'll probably do that. What? Already? You'll kill the relationship. A relationship needs to build slowly, like a campfire, first you feed it twigs. If you throw in a log it'll smother it. But we've already thrown in a log. We said things like, "I feel like I've known you my entire life." It's different. There's saying things and there's going to Sinai. Listen, once, I was in Berlin, and went to pick up my friend for a night out. And I'm walking, when suddenly someone shouts, "Shiny shoes!" Because I was wearing my gold shoes. And I turn around, only to find the hottest guy on Earth. And we smile at each other, and I keep walking to meet my friend, and I tell her, "We have to get back to this bar," "someone just yelled 'shiny shoes' at me." So we go back, sit down, and I scan the place until I spot him. Then I call out, "Shiny shoes!" and he turns to me, and I signal for him to come over, like this. He walks up, joins me, and we have the best time together, and he is the hottest, and the sweetest, and the smartest ever. And another friend joins us, and both my friends tell me in Hebrew, "He's amazing!" and I'm like, "I know!" We did lines in the bathroom and he leaned in to kiss me, and I was like "We can't have our first kiss in the bathroom," "It's too great of a story to be ruined." "It's like Cinderella 2020." - Because of the shoes. - Because of the shoes. Then we went back to my place, and sharing our entire life stories, and we're enchanted... And, wow, you're the most incredible person I've ever met... and I think I'm in love with you. And the next day, I couldn't stand the sight of him. Wow, you're right. We won't go to Sinai. Well, thanks, gorgeous, what a wild story. Sure thing. All right, I should get back to her. See you later. Bye. ALL EYES OFF ME I want to tell you something. What? No, don't freak out. It's nothing dramatic. I just feel like telling you, because I don't think I've ever loved someone the way I love you. So? And it's been weighing on me. I mean, it's not weighing on me, it's just sort of... a secret that I've never told anyone before. I feel close to you, and I've been waiting for a long time, for the right moment. And I was telling myself that I'll tell you today, and... But you can't tell anyone, okay? You have to swear. Of course. - I swear. - Okay. I think I also like guys. Okay. But like, not manly men, - I like guys that are more feminine. - Is that right? Does it stress you out? Not at all, but what do you mean by "feminine guys"? Wait, have you done it with someone? Yes. Okay. So I was in the Philippines with Oded, right? With him? No, not Oded. So... We went out to this bar one night... and... we got insanely drunk. Like, I was... I was super drunk. And... We danced with these two Filipinas... and... at some point Oded and his Filipina bailed. I mean separately. I think he picked up on it. And... I stayed with my Filipina. What was her name? Angelica. - And we went to the beach. - Okay. And we were walking together, she and I. And I was like looking for the furthest, darkest place that I could find. So we were walking for a really, really long time... and then we got to this pile of stacked-up folding chairs, made of plastic, like beach chairs. We climbed on top of it. Sort of kissed and made out a little. And it was nighttime, like it was dark. Still I was tripping that someone might pass by and see us, so I told her, "We should leave." And then we went to her place. And that's it. And did you fuck? Yes. Did you fuck him? Or did he fuck you? I fucked her. She was like really embarrassed about having a dick. She didn't let me touch it at all. She was really ashamed. And how was it? It was... She had this strange smell of Filipino cooking all over her house, of like fried fish. Because it was almost dawn and they do this thing in the Philippines. they deep-fry red mullets first thing in the morning. And it grossed me out, her bedsheets, the smell, the idea of what I was doing. But it also turned me on. It felt special. I really enjoyed it. Does it stress you out? Not at all. I'm really glad you told me. - It's touching. - Really? Totally. I mean, I'm not attracted to manly men... I'm attracted to the men closest to being a woman, you understand? I understand. I'm really glad that you told me. Me too. I feel really close to you. Me too. You're sweet for telling me and you're so beautiful. And you have a black thing in your teeth. Great! You're pretty. - You're pretty. - You're pretty. You're pretty. Don't let the headmistress catch us. Okay, but, but don't cum inside, okay? Yeah, I'm not cumming. Did you cum? - No but... - Okay, I'm not cumming. - Be careful, okay? - But did you cum? - Did you cum? - No. Not cumming. Did you cum? I'm not cumming. Did you cum? No, no, no, no, no, no... Why did you cum? No! No... You can do it harder. What? The choking. I was afraid you couldn't breathe. That's the point of choking, you know. Okay, what else? What do you mean? What else do you want me to do? You can, like, hurt me. Okay, but what else besides choking? Slapping? Sure, that too. What, like the ass? Or in general? In general. Wait, like the face too? Yeah. But... not in a half-hearted way. Choking's worse if you're scared, than not at all, get it? It's like the opposite of a turn-on. It's a turn-off when it's done softly. - Get it? - Yes. Okay. What else? You can... pull my hair. Spit on me. Okay, spit? Actually spit? Yeah, inside my mouth, a little bit. Okay. I get it. - Not a loogey. - Yeah, yeah, got it. - But, like, whatever you want. - Okay, got it. - This is really exciting! - Really! Wait, are you also into that? Yeah, I think so. I mean, I've never done it before, but I think so. I really want us to try it already! Totally! Let's order coke and I'll make us caipirinha and we'll do it tomorrow... No, I can't do it tomorrow. Let's schedule for Wednesday? It's weird to schedule it, isn't it? Yeah, but I can't just slap you. We need to schedule it. Right. Wait a sec. Okay, Wednesday night works. I'm sending you a calendar invite. Blanca! Blanca. Hey, Avishag. - Hey, didn't know you were here. - Yes, I'm just leaving. - Wait, did you take her out already? - No, no. I just dropped by to grab a bite between meetings. - How are you? Everything okay? - Yes. How about you? All good. Let me pay you, since we're already both here. Stop, Blanca, stop! Thanks. I have to get a wallet. - Bye, Avishag. Thanks. - Bye. Sure thing, bye! Ruby. Ruby. No. No, no, no. Come. Come. Get in! Come on. Chance! Morons. Mikey, come. Come, come. Three, two, one... - What a leopard! - Hello, Tiger! Hello! - What's up? - All good. First of all, I have to say "Wow." I'm nervous. And now, "roar" your name at us. Eden Ben-Zaken. I'm from Kiryat Shemona. 19 years old. Turn around a sec, give us a twirl! Listen, that outfit... 30 shekels! What will you sing? "Heart" by Christina Aguilera. - "Hurt"? - "Hurt." "Hurt. "You said "Heart." - So let's hear you sing. - The stage is all yours. Good luck. So adorable! Avishag? Avishag! Avishag! Max? What the fuck? I couldn't remember the code. - How could you not remember? - Dunno, I forgot it. So you tried to break the door down? Not break it, I was trying to open it. What, are you for real?! You can unlock some doors by leaning against them. - I wasn't trying to break it. - Max, you were pounding the door. Really pounding it. I was outside, I couldn't get in. So what was I supposed to do? I was trying to come in. Do you have any lemons? Yeah. You can play a different song. Play a different song. Wait, I'll play a song I really love. That reminds me of you. Okay. Here. Want me to translate for you? - Of course. - Okay. It's... "On the phone there's your voice, and words that aren't mine..." "They're terrifying, when they aren't funny" "As they've appeared in" "films, songs" "I want to say those words to you" "I want to live them" "Wait for me, I'm coming..." "Prepare your time for me, You have all of mine" "I need to get there, I'm staying" "I hate myself" "I would like to get there" "But I can't" "I should speak to you" "I should get to you" "Or should I go to sleep?" "I'm afraid that you're deaf" "I fear that you're a coward" "I fear that I may be too invasive" "I cannot tell you that I love you" "Maybe" "But if one day, you'll think that you love me" "Run, run, run to me" "Until you are out of breath" "And find me" "If one day, you'll think that you love me" "Even if every path" "Leads somewhere unknown" "Come find me" "If the nausea of life" "Goes through you" "If the exhaustion of existence, lies within you" "Think of me" "Think of me" "But if..." "One day you'll think you love me" "Don't consider it a problem" "Run, run, run to me, run until you are out of breath" "Come and find me!" "If one day you'll think you love me" "Don't wait a single day" "Not a single week" "You never know where life may lead you" "Come and find me" "If the nausea of life" "Infiltrates you" "If the exhaustion of existence" "Lies within you" "Think of me" "Think of me" "But if..." That's really beautiful. I'm jealous that you speak French, you motherfucker. - I really do love you, Avishag. - I know. When I was living in Paris... I was... One day I was walking around the Metro. It was pretty late, like around midnight. And... a beggar sat there at the station, this old homeless guy. And I gave him some change, and said "Bonne nuit, mec!" That's French for "Goodnight, dude!" And then the homeless guy goes, "Je ne suis pas mec. Je suis monsieur!" You understand? This guy has no leg, it's midnight at the Metro station, but he's a "Monsieur." I think it's amazing. That's what's great about the French. Tell me, do you think that at some point in your life, you'll want to have kids? I dunno. It's hard to say whether I'll want to. "Want" exists in the present, not in the future tense. Right now, it's not something I want. Me neither. Does it stress you out that I'm asking? No. Does it stress you out that I'm not stressed out? No. - Like that? - Harder. Okay. Harder. - Harder? - Yeah. Wait. - Are you my whore? - Yeah. - You like being my whore? - Yeah. - Does this feel good? - Yeah. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Wait, wait, wait, I need a second to breathe. Wait. Wait. Wait. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Come to me. Come to me, everything all right. Come to me. Don't worry, everything is all right. Everything is fine. Everything is all right. Everything is all right. Everything is all right. Look at me. Look at me. - You up? Want coffee? - No, thanks. Baby, you've got some bruises. Nah, you can barely tell. Fuck. We kinda overdid it yesterday, huh? - Kinda. - Let me see. - Did you enjoy it though? - Yes. And you're good? Yeah, I'm just a little tired. But you don't seem like you're good. Want me to stay? Cancel my shift? No, no, no. I'm just going back to sleep. Max, I'm good. I'll just go back to sleep. Go. I'm going back to sleep. - I'll call you when I can. - Okay. Avishag, I wanted to ask if you were interested. I'm driving to my mother's tonight, she's having an operation, I wanted to ask if you were interested in watching Blanca at my place until this evening? Because I'll be back late, I don't want to leave her alone, she tears the house up when I'm gone. I need to find her a trainer. In any case, I know this might be too much to ask. Let me know if you're free and interested, I'll pay by the hour. MAX It's been a long time since anybody has waited for me out there And if there's no sea Then there's no ship either The path shortened, the circle tightened Well, what then? Another week... another month, another year... After I die Something in the world would still remain Someone would love another Someone would hate The path shortened The score unsettled Well, what then? Another week. Another month, another year... The path shortened... The dew settles, the chill of night across my face At the nearby crossroad that same station Tomorrow I shall wake and open my eyes Dear God Another week... Another month, another year... It's been a long time Since anybody has waited for me out there And if there's no sea Then there's no ship either... Shit. The path shortened The circle tightened Well, what then? Another week... MAX: 17 MISSED CALLS. DROR BLANCA: HI AVISHAG, THANKS FOR TODAY. GOOD NIGHT! Hi. - Good morning. - Good morning. - I'm sorry, I fell asleep. - It's all good. Would you like some coffee? - I can give you a lift home. - Yes, thank you. Sure. Thanks for watching her. It really helped me out. Sure thing. - Do you make honey? - No. - What happened to you there? - Nothing. Then what are the beehives for? I keep bees. As pets? Sort of. Is your mom doing okay? Yes. It's nothing serious. A bone in her foot was sticking out... and she couldn't wear shoes because of the pain. So they cut it off. I mean the bone. They removed some of it. And she's in a great deal of pain, but it's fine, the operation was successful, now she has to recover. - So she's fine. - Yes, yes. And how are you? I had a terrible day, actually. I'm sorry to hear. You're a sweetheart. It's fine. Are you close with your parents? In a way. I mean, they... They're very religious, so in a way. And you're not? No. No. When did they realize that you weren't? Wow. I'd forgotten about this. Once, I swallowed... Do you know what acetone is? Of course I know what acetone is. It's nail polish remover. So I drank acetone. Why? I was in... I mean I was applying to this yeshiva in Jerusalem, Mercaz Ha-Rav Yeshiva. It's the most prestigious yeshiva. It only accepts straight-A students or sons of rabbis. I took lots of tests, got accepted, it was a big deal, my acceptance, everybody knew about it. - And when I got there-- - How old were you? 14, I think. Yeah, 14. And when I got there, I realized everything was pitiful. That it all seemed like an orphanage straight out of a Charles Dickens novel. I wanted to leave. From the moment I arrived, I knew I had to get out of there. So I called my parents, talked to my dad, whispered, so not to be heard. I said, "Dad, I don't want to be here anymore." And he went crazy. He was mad that I had the nerve to even think of leaving. So I drank acetone. What did you think was going to happen? I thought that maybe I wouldn't feel well. I don't know what I was thinking. All I wanted was not to be there. And what happened? Nothing. It really burned, and I threw up a little. But nothing happened. - Funny. - Yeah. And? And that's it. From that point on, it went downhill. The first ritual I stopped was laying phylacteries. - Because, why must we lay phylacteries? - Why? Because it's written "And for frontlets between thine eyes..." - What are "frontlets"? - Exactly. They tried to figure out what "frontlets" meant, and they had no clue, so they interpreted it as literally as possible, "frontlets between thine eyes," take the Torah and place it between your eyes. It sounded so ridiculous that I stopped. At some point, I stopped so many things that I realized it was over. One day, I left after prayer, looked up to the sky, I remember a red sunset. Maybe it's an implanted memory. In any case, that was the moment. After that I got very depressed. I sat in my room for a whole year. I listened to records and the rest of the time I would walk around the Yeshiva asking people why they don't kill themselves. Shall we? Tell me... why is there a painting of a dead dog over your bed? It's my friend's piece, who's a famous artist. It's worth a lot of money and he gave it to me as a gift. Okay. And do you like it? It was a gift. Yeah, but you have a portrait of a dead dog hanging over your bed. Yes. That's right. Maybe I should take it down. - It is peculiar. - Yes. I really like your house, though. I mean, besides the dog painting. I like it a lot. And I listened to a record yesterday. Did something happen? Why do you ask? Because I'm asking. Could I use your shower? I feel like I need to shower. Is it okay if I use your shower? - Sure. - Where? Where is it? Okay. No, no, Blanca! No! Blanca, drop it! Drop it! Drop it! No! - Could I borrow a shirt? - She chewed up your shoe! Oh, bummer. I'm so sorry, I'll buy you a new one. - It's fine, no worries. - I can't deal with her anymore. Why don't you let her out? Because she starts barking when she's out. - So? She's a dog. Dogs bark. - Drop it. Drop it! - Really, it's all good. - Drop it! Really. It's fine. Grab your bag. Grab your things, so she can't get to them. No, I'll put them away. I'll put it here. She won't get them there. I truly apologize, I take full responsibility, okay? Okay. Are you hungry? No, thanks. - Do you cook? - No. Then what do you do? What do I do? I eat out. Sometimes I cook. - What? - Basic things. - What?! - Pasta, breaded chicken. Oh. But how come you can't cook? You seem like a person who would know how to cook. Because I grew up in a Kibbutz. We didn't have a kitchen at home. No way. Yeah, we had this little counter with a sink. We didn't have a kitchen. I've never seen my mother cook. Really. Do you remember what I wore today? - What? - Do you remember what I was wearing? What? When? Just now? A dress, or... white overalls. - Right. - Yes. Do you remember details? I think, something red. That's right. What was I wearing when we last saw each other? Remember? No. I do. You were wearing shorts. That's right, because I came straight from work. Right. Usually you wear pants. Yes, that's true. But it actually looked nice, your Bermuda shorts. And you were also wearing a light colored button-down shirt. It seemed like you were on vacation. And you were sweating, you had these big underarm circles. But it was beautiful, like the sweat of a tourist on vacation who's sweating because he is not used to the local weather. You're such a sweetheart. What? I'm really attracted to you. I don't understand why. Because. Let's go to my bed? You're funny, "my bed." Do you like my body? Yeah. You like my belly? Yeah. It's not fat? Not at all. Do you like my legs? Yes. And my skin, it's not too pale? Your skin feels great. Wait. Do you find my face pretty? Very much so. Everything? Yes. Do you like the forehead? The nose? The ears? Yes. So you love me totally? Yes. Look at me. Look at me. Are you okay? Yes. Yes. I want a cigarette. Your hair is so soft. Don't ever wear it up. Okay. This day is so incredible. I've never experienced anything like it, Avishag. I'll never forget it, for as long as I live. When did you adopt Blanca? You don't do well with silence, huh? Zero capacity to tolerate silence. Were there women you just lay beside in silence? Yes. For how long? Two, maybe three minutes. Two, maybe three minutes of being silent? Yeah. You get comfortable and stay silent, yeah. And what... what do you do? You think thoughts. About each other? General thoughts. I want to try it too. I'll get comfortable and stay silent for a whole minute. Wait. No, no kissing. - Kissing isn't allowed? - No. Kissing is a distraction. Reset.
