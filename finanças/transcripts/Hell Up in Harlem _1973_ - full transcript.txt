Mr. Diangelo, I gotta talk to you. It's important. Hey, call the DA's office. It's about Tommy Gibbs. Let the young lady alone. What about Tommy Gibbs? It's all set up. On 57th street and 5th Avenue, they're gonna kill him. Why tell me? Why don't you warn Gibbs personally? I'm a part of it. I can't. You mean you had a change of heart? They threatened to kill my kids! Who? You won't believe me, but some of your police. So the police are going to kill Tommy Gibbs in cold blood and you want me to stop it? What should I do? Arrest the entire New York City police department? There are ledgers with names of corrupt city officials. Tommy thinks they're still in his safe deposit box. I made a wax impression of the key, and I gave it to those pigs. They have the ledgers now! That's the only hold Tommy had over them. Get in the car, please. You black bitches are all alike. You're stupid! Gibbs is as good as dead already. It's done. Some very important people have taken care of that. Please don't kill Tommy! Kill me! Do anything, but don't kill Tommy, please! Irish... Irish, don't you think it's about time? Drop me a block from Tiffany's. Please kill me. No! Up on the sidewalk! Here's $500! Get up on that sidewalk! He's not going anywhere. He's caught in traffic ahead. He'll never make it to Broadway. Run that light! Run that light! Step on it, man! Step on it! Jesus Christ, man, they got guns! Don't stop! Don't stop! He's gonna shoot! We hit him, but he got away. He's bleeding like a pig. He's somewhere in the city now. You need a Cannon to kill those niggers, for crying out loud. Well, we have nothing to worry about as long as we still have the ledgers. Hello? It's Tommy. I'm hurt. I need your help. You turned your back on me when I was a kid. Don't do it to me again. Meet me where we used to live. All right. Son, I came when you called me. I'm here to help you. God, what did they do to you? Get me off the street. They're looking for me. God, I've never seen a man shot before. I didn't expect my son to be like this. Come on, let me give you a hand. All right? I'll get you to your friends safely. Cops... They're trying to kill me. Just put one foot in front of you... And just put your weight on me. We'll go to the park and rest. You remember? Where you used to play as a kid. You're hurt bad. We'll have to get you to a hospital. But they'll have them all covered, pa. Sit down here, son. That's right. Gotta take over a hospital, pa. Gotta hide the ledgers where nobody'll find them. I can hide them right here in the park. Where I used to take you when you was a small boy. That hiding place, remember? That secret place we had? Ok. I got you. Sit down. Here... There's... a number on that piece of paper. It's the number of some brothers that still may help me. Get 'em over here. You got... you got a half hour before you make that call. Make sure, pa, you get through to Diangelo personally! Mention the word "ledgers." Sorry to break in on you like this, but... We didn't figure you'd make us a house call. All right... Get started, will ya? Don't put me to sleep, doc. God damn! You some kind of horse doctor? I said no calls. But he says it's about some ledgers. Wait outside. Put him on and have the call traced. This is Mr. Diangelo speaking. Mr. Diangelo? We have the ledgers. Unless Tommy Gibbs is given safe conduct from the hospital, copies will be sent to your superiors. I don't believe you. Who is this? Xerox is a very useful weapon, Mr. Diangelo. Don't hang up! Bye. Get me the captain in charge of Harlem hospital. Gibbs? Gibbs! We got our orders. We're gonna give you an ambulance, and nobody's gonna follow you. We're gonna guarantee your safety. Are you listening to me, Gibbs? Now, release the hostages! Well, answer me! Look, Diangelo, I talked to him. He won't even give me an answer. I know I got my orders, but I'm not about... You listen to me. These are my men here. I'm not gonna have them put in a meat chopper. Those are your orders, captain! Yeah. If those bastards in there so much as twitch or squeeze off one round, you nail them! Johnny... T-tell the boys not to shoot first. Don't shoot first... Whatever you do. Stay cool. Hold your fire, Zach! We got a deal with them! Hold your fire! Got a deal going with the cops. Don't screw it up. Doc... I hope that ambulance... Is in the back for your sake, doc! Everybody stand back. Don't interfere with those men at all. Stand back. The men are dangerous. Stay out of their way. Keep those people back. Everyone, stay back. Keep those people back over there! All you officers stand back. They have safe conduct from the district attorney. Where are you guys taking me? What... what are you doing here? I don't know what you people want with me. I haven't done anything wrong. Mr. Gibbs. Yes, sir. My name is Diangelo, district attorney for this county. Your son had in his possession books with the names of very important people in this city, and if they get in the wrong hands, it's going to cause a lot of trouble for a lot of people. I don't know anything about any books. Mr. Gibbs, is it because you don't trust me? No, sir. That's not it. Please try to think, Mr. Gibbs. In truth, sir, I don't know anything about any books. I'm trying to help you. I understand that, sir, but I don't know what you're talking about. I'm sorry, Mr. Gibbs. Can I go home now, sir? Look, I don't know anything about any books. I didn't do anything. No! It's the truth! I didn't do nothin'! Motherfuckers! Dirty damn... I saw those guys pick you up on the street, so I thought I'd follow you. Tommy gonna be proud of you. Took care of 2 of 'em. Welcome to the club, pa. I killed 'em. I had to. It all happened so quick. You done well. It must run in the family. I've never hit anyone like that since I was a child. They went down so easy. Got their blood all over me. We're both wanted killers now, pa. Father and son. But we'll be back on top soon, running things. 'Cause I got the goods on everybody. You know, I'm gonna take you in the business, pa, as a partner. That's right. A partner. Yes, sure. I appreciate it. You're gonna have to earn it. You got a lot of work to do while I lie low. I'll be close by when you need me. But first... We gotta pay off everybody that was involved in that action outside of Tiffany's. And we gotta do it quick. Before they realize your son is back in operation. Well... You just give me the names and places of everybody. If mama could just see us now... together. She'd be happy. I got something planned for Helen. She was working with those pigs like Diangelo to steal the ledgers so she's got to pay for that, pa, you understand? So you find her and you take away the only thing she really loves. We've never met. I'm Tommy's father. Put them in the car. You ain't fit to raise children. I said, put them in the car! Wait! What are you going to do with them? Bring them up like they were my own. You've got no love for them. You're just doing this to hurt me, to get even. I got love for them, and I'm gonna try to keep them from ever knowing what their mother did to their father. Wait... Let me kiss them good-bye? Please? All right. Go ahead. Good evening, Mr. Diangelo. Good to see you again. Diangelo! Pa, what's the matter? I just had a bad dream. I dreamt I... I dreamt that I killed Diangelo. Diangelo? In front of a crowd of people. In front of the opera. What's wrong with the old man? Sick... Or did he piss in the bed? You shut your mouth. You talk when I tell you to talk! Now, you apologize to my pa! It's all right, son. It's all right. No, it's not all right. You show my pa some respect. You apologize, now! I'm sorry. I don't wanna read your lips. I wanna hear you! Say it! Sorry... if that makes you feel any better. Your ambition's gonna get you in a lot of trouble, Zach. Now, you get out. Take care of that wound. I'll take care of it, Zach. Lay down, pa. Get some rest. Ok, son. We'll take care of Diangelo in due time. Matter of fact, I'm gonna give you a lot of practice tomorrow. I want you to take care of that informer who fingered me in front of Tiffany's. They got over 200 kilos of heroin coming in from Singapore, shipped out of Tokyo. Now, we'll shut down their Japanese connection. Now, I know you can handle some of them little Japanese guys, right, pa? Now, we'll pull our own little Pearl harbor on them, right? We'll put the syndicate out of business, dry up their sources of revenue. Then they got no money for payoffs, and Diangelo comes to us. Now, you watch the store for me, pa. I got some island-hopping to do. I'll bring you back a souvenir? The heads of the crime syndicate as our prisoners of war. Then we sort of exchange pows, right? I mean, they give us our freedom, clear us of all charges, and we let the big bosses live a little bit longer. Who made up all that bullshit that black people don't know how to swim? How do you like the hired help, palermo? They'll clean up the mess they made, won't you, ladies? Now, see, that just goes to show you, you never know who's doing up your socks and underwear. No more killing. We'll negotiate. We'll work this out. How can I? I'm a wanted man, me and my pa. That could be fixed up. We got judges, prosecutors, on our payroll. The ladies here cooked something in the kitchen. Go bring it in, ladies. Now, you gentlemen are gonna be my guests till after my acquittal. Sorta like my, security. Now, that's what they call... Soul food. Now, you got black-eyed peas, turnip Greens... Chitlins... Collard Greens, pig feet, cornbread... Pork butts... And for dessert... Watermelon! Eat heartily, gentlemen. The grand jury is gonna fail to indict Tommy Gibbs and his old man. That's right. We're both gonna be found innocent... Victims of racial slurs and police conspiracy. Diangelo here is gonna fix it up for me. Ain't that right, Diangelo? Anything can be fixed in the good ol' usa. Didn't have to do this, Tommy. We could've sat down and talked. Well, maybe I just wasn't brought up right. I don't happen to trust people. I sorta figured if you thought I was weak, you'd mop the street up with me, and I'd have to kill a lot more of your people to put you in your place. Now, if I don't get what I want, Diangelo, that means war. War like you never seen before. None of this old-time bullshit going after your numbers runners or your pushers. No, I'll be going after your... Bank presidents, heads of corporations. It'll look like a race riot to everybody. But you'll know what it is. Tell you what I'm gonna do, Diangelo. I'm gonna make you a hero. I'm gonna let you arrest Tommy Gibbs. A grand jury today dismissed all charges against Tommy Gibbs and his father Thomas Gibbs, sr. A massive investigation has been ordered into alleged police conspiracies to assassinate Gibbs, the self-styled "Black Caesar" of Harlem's underworld. Got the man working late. Well... Gentlemen. Mr. Diangelo. I want you to know that I, certainly appreciate you fixing up them murder charges against me. However, you will not be taking your instructions from me. You'll be getting them from Mr. Gibbs, sr. Over there. I think you know him. Yes, we know one another. We have met in very high places. Mr. Gibbs, I... I... I mean, the whole thing was... was a terrible mistake. I... I... That's all right, Mr. Diangelo. I'd like for you to meet another very important member of my organization. This here is Mr. Zachariah, my enforcer. However, I suggest you call him Zach. He's a very ambitious young man. I'm gonna follow you all over. When you go to the airport, I'll be your ticket. When you walk down the street, I'll be your shadow. In other words, I'm gonna be all over your ass. Gentlemen... I mean, after all, gentlemen, you can trust me. I mean, let's... Let's look forward to the future. Let's not dwell on the past. Let's forget the past. No, we won't forget the past, Mr. Diangelo. It's the past. Yes, the past. Look around. When we close down his drug operation, poor Diangelo ain't gonna have nothing left but his salary as a public servant. Let me hear somebody say "wonderful"! Wonderful! Let me hear somebody say "hallelujah"! Hallelujah! Let me hear somebody say "amen"! Amen! Amen. I want you to lift your head up high and... and hold your hands apart and just clench your fists and tighten them up. I want you to go out in the streets and... and fight the dope and fight the crime and fight the murdering. I want you to go up against people like Tommy Gibbs and his father! Hello, reverend. Hello. I watched you on TV tonight. You must get your kicks out of hearing your name mentioned. You're causing me a lot of problems, Rufus. I'm pleased to hear I'm so effective. You weren't so high-and-mighty when you were pimping for me up on Lennox Avenue. That was before I heard my calling. Man, don't try to sell me that you believe in that religious bullshit! I know you too well. It's big money, and you always did have some smarts. Yeah, it started like that. But I found out that I could... I could help people. I'm gonna put you out of Harlem. You and your old man. They tried to shoot my ass out, so I guess you gonna pray my ass out, right? I'm gonna appeal to all the decent black folks that don't want nobody like you running their lives. Why don't you go after those white bosses that are selling heroin to the kids? And I suppose you're not into that? I'm not into drugs, Rufus. I'm shutting out the suppliers. I'm knocking out all the pushers as quick as I can find 'em! Murdering them. Well, what the hell do you think they're doing selling that shit on the streets to the kids? Rufus... Don't turn on me. Not when I'm trying. I don't believe you. If there's money in it in the black community, you grab it off the top. Well, I guess we just don't know each other anymore, do we, Rufus? Take him back where you got him. Are you comfortable in my chair? You damn right. Well, then you get your dead ass out of it right now. Now! I caught this broad running around downstairs again, man. Why don't you let me off that broad? I'd have thought that you'd be gone, started someplace else. I couldn't. What do you want? I wanna talk to Tommy. I got the right. Look, whatever happened to him, he should settle with me now. I wanna see him. Tommy, you're looking at me as though you've never seen me before. We had a lot going once. You knew I never wanted to get involved in the business. You forced me into it. I just wasn't strong enough to handle it. She left me for my best friend Joe. She had 2 of his kids, then she had him killed... Just like she tried to do to me. Go away! What do you wanna do, kill me? I'd welcome that. Maybe I'll make you kill me. You won't be rid of me till you do. I'm not gonna run away anymore. And I'm not gonna keep away from the kids. They're our kids now. And if you want me out of the way, you'll have to put a bullet in me, so you might as well do it now. Ain't nobody gonna touch a hair on your head. You're the safest woman in New York City. You can walk any street any time at night and ain't nothing gonna happen to you. I don't wanna see her again, pa, any time, any place. I'll keep her away. Feel like I'm back in Sunday school again. What are you doing here? Just passing through. Who's she? Sister Jennifer. Yeah? You do a team act now? This your number one trick? You don't have to antagonize me, Mr. Gibbs. I happen to believe that you are a decent man. He's always had a knack for foolin' women. Reverend Rufus, why must we single him out? We have the names of all the syndicate men who have exploited the black community since we were all children. Why don't we speak out against them? Yeah, I'll consider it. No, no. Answer her now, Rufus. Tell her that your financial support comes from whitey. And that... They wanna hear about blacks exploiting blacks. You got a program on TV, you gotta give 'em what they wanna hear about. Thank you, miss. You got a lot to learn, and, I don't think you're gonna find it all in the Bible. How about dinner tomorrow night? Thank you. No. Why not? You scared? Yes... slightly. But not nearly as much as I am amused of your arrogance, Mr. Gibbs. You seem to think that you can handle everyone and everything by a quick smile and a fast remark. Does it bug you that I can pull it off? No... But you haven't. You happen to be a very lonely man, Mr. Gibbs. A sad man. Like the man said, lady... You givin' me the blues. Anyway... I was just passing through because I, I thought I'd drop this off in your collection plate. I'm sorry about the other night. No need for you and I to be enemies. Don't take that! $5,000? This'll feed an awful lot of families. Looks like the lady don't listen too good, Rufus. Well, babe... Any time you get lonely for somebody other than Jesus, Rufus here can give you my private number. Mr. Gibbs, I really would like to see you. I believe... You and I could be friends. Tell Tommy "thanks." Tommy had nothing to do with it. Hello, can I speak to Diangelo? Yes. Hello, Zach. I've been waiting for your call. Our little business is taken care of? It's all over. Good. No witnesses? Nope. That's very good to hear, Zach. You know, I do believe you and I are gonna have a great future, kid. All right, Gibbs, Diangelo wants you downtown. Let's go. Ok, Diangelo, I'm a busy man. We're looking into the murder of a young lady named... Helen Bradley. Why so shocked? She was a 2-bit whore. She worked around the 47th Street area. Was better looking than most, but... Can't tell that from the police photographs. Here... Take a look at them. Maybe you can identify the body. You care to go down to the morgue with me? Who killed her? A lot of them end up this way... Murdered by one of their Johns. Much more merciful than an advanced case of syphilis, right? It was strangulation. Very professional job. She was an old friend of yours, wasn't she? I knew her. She must've been a beautiful woman once. I understand she, had a couple of kids. It's kind of a blessing that they'll never find out what kind of profession mama was in. What time was she killed? Tommy, there's no charge against you, for crying out loud. It's a much more delicate matter than that. I mean, we're good friends, aren't we? And, I mean, it's really difficult to... To bring up the matter of your father. I mean, what's one little whore, more or less? It doesn't make any difference. But we have very good reason to believe your father was responsible. I don't believe you. You're a loyal son, Tommy. Really, I hope my kids grow up the same way and feel that way about me. Probably did it for your sake. That's the way parents are. Is that all? I just want you to know I'm not gonna do anything about it out of deference to you. You know everything that goes on. Who killed Helen? Who killed her? Your father. Your father paid for it. I don't know what's keeping Mr. Gibbs, but we'll hold dinner until he arrives. Tommy's asked me to be his wife. What do you think, reverend? If you want my advice, you'd go back to your preaching. It's about time. I'm starving to death. Daddy, is Jennifer gonna be my mommy? Take him upstairs. Put him to bed. I don't wanna go to bed yet. But he hasn't had his dinner. Do like I say. Take him upstairs. Come on, honey. Kiss your grandfather good night. Good night, grandfather. Good night, son. You go save some souls. Good night, Mr. Gibbs. Good night, reverend. It's been good to see you for a second. Helen didn't just get killed. It was a professional job. Well, why are you telling me? I thought you might be interested. That woman was nothing but grief to you. You ought to be grateful. Grateful? To you, pa? You think I had something to do to do with her death? I gave you strict orders that she was to be left alone. You know I don't go against you, son. You're a stinking liar! This is your father you're talking to. Maybe you think you give the orders around here. Well... I've been doing pretty good with the territory you gave me. You got any complaints? Yeah. I got some complaints. Lots of 'em. I'm sick of you. I'm sick of this town! I haven't had one moment's pleasure. You know what I'm gonna do, pa? I'm gonna give it all to you, and I'm gonna go to Detroit and Los Angeles and look after my other interests and leave this all in your capable hands! It's getting too expensive to run an operation in this town anyway. Payoffs are too damn high. I appreciate your confidence in me. I'll see how long you can cut it, old man, without me around to protect your black ass. I don't recall asking you for anything in a very long time. After I'm gone, a lot of people are gonna try to move you out of business so don't expect me to come back and hold your hand! Tommy, can't you see? Even in death, this woman is tearing us apart! You had no right to do that to her! Whatever she was... Whatever I say you wouldn't believe, would you? Pack your bags. What? Pack the kids', too. We're leaving. Gonna leave everything to... to... Big papa. We'll get married in Los Angeles. Mr. Gibbs... Is there anything I can do to help? No, darling. Between me and my son. Hi, mama. Sorry it took me so long to get here, but I've been a very busy man. I'm in a new life now. Killing, women. Lot of women. Things that you would be ashamed of, and I hope you forgive me. I miss you, and I love you. Nobody, but nobody, talks to Tommy. Listen, Zach killed Helen. He's trying to make his own deal with Diangelo. He's hidin' out up at Grant's tomb. Send the boys up there and ice his bad ass! Any dealing done in this town will be done through me. Son of a bitch! This is compliments of me and Mr. Diangelo. Something's bothering you. Is it what they say in the newspapers about you? Like I promised you before I married you, I'm going 100 percent legit. What about your father in New York? The entire organization? I got no control over that. They're just friends. I can't tell them how to make a living. You still don't see anything wrong in killing people and taking what's theirs. Not if they took it from somebody first. But we've been through all that. I've already proved that I was the best, so I don't need it no more. Tommy, you talk about renouncing the rackets as I would if I were asked to give up my belief in god. Zach? Zach. Son of a bitch! Zach! Hey, old man. I see you got your nurses. Seems to me you're trying to set yourself up in your own business? First Helen... Then a few of the boys. Next it'll be me. Then maybe Tommy? Tommy? I already got him. Look around. I own it. All of it. Well, I'm gonna take back what is mine. You don't have too long. You know you got a slow ticker. You could go any minute. You need a whipping, boy. Boy? Where you see a boy? And I'm gonna do it with these own 2 hands. You sure that's the way you want it, old man? No guns, fellas. I'm gonna beat this boy with my own 2 hands. The old man's gonna whup my ass? I want every railroad terminal, bus depot, and airport checked. And the minute Gibbs gets back in town, I want to be notified immediately. Is that understood? All right. Don't go to New York. They want you to step back in New York so they can blow your head off. Hap. Make reservations to New York City. You got no organization back there no more, Tommy. Zach took it all. You got nothing. I started with nothing, and I can take back what's mine. Hap. Change those reservations to Philly. I'm going to ease into New York... quiet-like. I got me some funerals to attend. Well, Diangelo, here it is. I got it made. Yeah, if Gibbs doesn't take it away from you. Take what? Hell, I ain't running. All he likes to do is read the wall street journal, get clean and go to church. Well, as they say, a young man should never retire. Unless he's ready to die. He's a candy-ass. I flew to California, man, out to his house, fired some shots in the crib, and he didn't have the balls to do a damn thing. He didn't even have the balls to come after me. He didn't have the balls to do nothing. I even killed his old man. No balls at all. "No balls" Gibbs. Listen close. I've always been the best hit man in the business, and I got a contract to fill on every son of a bitch that works for Diangelo or Zach. I'm closing down the city. I'm going to make New York a decent place to live. Police continue to hunt the professional killer who, within the last 24 hours, has struck down leading members of New York's underworld. An official statement issued by the office of James Diangelo concedes that there are no new leads as to the identity of the gunman, described by witnesses only as a black man in his early 30s. He's undermining everything we've built up all these years. Don't sweat it, man. We'll ice him. Now, there's one thing Gibbs prizes more than anything in this world, and that's his family. His wife gave her soul back to the almighty lord Jesus Christ. And she even ran away with the baby girl. There's still the other child. What's his name? Jason. Must be about 8 years old now. Hey, hey. Hey, I thought I'd do anything for the man, but killing kids, that's a no. That's why I can't trust anybody to do anything except myself. Senator Brown, I'm sending you a present for your investigating committee... Ledgers with the names of all the politicians who've been taking payoffs since the 1950s. Don't try to find me to say thanks, because I'll be out of the country by the time you receive this. I'm giving you some help by eliminating a few of the boys myself. Heh heh. Bring it on! It's Gibbs! Where's Zach? I don't know. Where's Zach? TWA... Airport. Trans world airlines flight number 27 for Los Angeles is now in its final boarding process at gate 7. Final call for TWA flight 27 for Los Angeles. The next flight to I.A... what gate? Gate 7. When's the next flight to I.A.? Any airline. American airlines, in 5 minutes. You'll never make it. Bullshit! First class, Los Angeles. American airlines flight 5 for Los Angeles is boarding on gate number 7. Our flight time to Los Angeles will be 4 hours and 5 minutes. Please fasten your seatbelts and extinguish all cigarettes in preparation for our landing in Los Angeles. What the hell are they doing over there? That's my suitcase! Jesus Christ! What is this? Security officer, report to baggage area immediately. Jesus Christ, he's got a... Look out! Get out of the way! Somebody call the police! Look out! He's got a gun! Call the police! They're going up the ramp! Look out! Look out for that gun! Isn't there any security officers around here? They came here an hour ago. Your friend Diangelo. They killed hap. It's too late! They took your boy away! There's nothing you can do about it. Why in the hell did you let it happen? They had guns. I'm a man of god now. I don't use violence anymore. Where did Diangelo take him? I don't know. They said they'd call you, let you know what the deal was. I'll kill that honky bastard! That's all that matters? Tommy Gibbs gets to have his sweet revenge. Well, I'm going to call the police. You think they give a damn if my kid comes back alive? Rufus, I love my son. I'll give Diangelo whatever he wants. It's kidnapping, murder. They have to help us. Let me take it. Yes? Yes, Diangelo. I'm reverend Rufus Fairchild, acting as intermediary on the matter. What's he after? State your terms, Diangelo. They want your life. Yeah, well, I figured that. How do we know Jason is all right? We want to see Jason first. Ok. An hour. Hello? There's no guarantee they'll return Jason, even after they got you. If I don't come back, and they return Jason... Tell Jennifer to leave town, go someplace else, change their names. Forget about me. Move. Where's my kid? Where is he? There are no niggers in this neighborhood. You don't really expect to see him, do you? Is he all right? Diangelo's got him. He's the only one with stomach enough to kill a kid. What do you want from me? Just you. You hear me up there? Yeah, I hear you. We can make a deal. Tommy Gibbs don't make deals. They're going to kill your kid tonight. That's all I know. Rest in peace, brother. Well, that's one sinner that won't sin no more. Here. I'll take this. It's been a long time. Welcome back, brother. Well, I couldn't very well let them kill you. Well, maybe you should have. Would have saved you a lot of praying later on. I still got to save your soul. Yeah, that's true. Let's go see if he knows where my son is. Mission of San Marco? San Marco? That's just like Diangelo to hide out in a church. Well, you'll feel right at home, Rufus. Don't move, Rufus. Jason, don't move. Let the kid alone, Diangelo. Let him walk away. You're the one to blame, Tommy. You should've stayed retired. Instead, you had to come back into the business and bring your whole family with you. Now, toss those guns away, or I'll kill this boy, I swear I will. My life for his, Diangelo. All right, Tommy. You got a deal. Fair trade. You know what I'm going to do to you? Figure it out, Diangelo. Figure it out. I'm going to send you to wop heaven! I'm going to make you famous, Diangelo! You're going to be the first whitey ever hung by a nigger! Jason? Jason! Jason! We're going away, son... Just the two of us. We're going to start over where nobody knows us, and I'm going to love you just like I loved my pa.
