Well done. Go ahead. How many cards for you? Three. 1... 2... 3... You're a rich man, now. All the newspapers are talking about you. That's right! Here's to you, Burt, the most dangerous outlaw in the territory, that's you. You're mighty clever, brother Burt. Ain't nobody is smarter than you are. And them law men, needn't think they can stop us. No, sir, they can't. If we want to reach Mexico, we've got to get ourselves a hostage... Without wasting any time. The nearest ranch, is old Brewster's. There's his daughter and his hired hands. You two go over there with Ramirez and kidnap the girl. Hold it! Sit down. -Stinky you've got to write a note. -What on? Ain't got no paper. -Here, you can use that. -Ain't got no pen. In your pocket. Come on, hurry up, don't waste time. "We're holding your daughter hostage... If anybody tries to stop our getaway... you'll find a corpse." Got that? "...at the dry tree pass. But she'll be freed once we cross over the border". And then put my name at the bottom. Burt Kelly. Are you sure this is right? Is that my name, Burt? Sure. Here. Nail it to the door. Now for our game. Now don't you cheat, or I'll catch you! Adios, amigos. Good luck. Hey, Ramirez, we're getting close to the Brewster place. Y'all better watch your step from here on. You sure don't want to make any mistakes. -There's no telling what crazy Kelly might do. -Don't worry about it, Stinky. We'll be careful. We're nearly there, Ramirez. We'd better leave the horses. -OK, now, keep low. -Got it. That's the house down there. Ain't hardly anyone around This is going to be a push over. Miss Brewster, help! It's the killer gang! Everybody run for cover. Hold still! Let go! Get your dirty hands off me! -Hold still, damn you! -Get away from me! Hey you two, come here and give me a hand with this woman. Let go, Let go! My father will get you, you bastards! You'll pay for this! Hold still! Stop struggling! Let go, you bandits! -I said stop struggling! -You'll all hang for this! -If you don't shut up, I'm going to... -I'll see that you hang! You won't get away with this! Please... We hold your daughter hostage. If the posse comes after us.... You will find your daughter slaughtered at dry tree pass. If instead everything is OK... we will leave her alive at Pueblo San Basilio, before we leave California. -Signed, Burt Kelly. Crazy Kelly... Him and his kid brother, and that gang of theirs. He's crazy enough to do anything. Well, we'll have to stop them. How can we as long as he's got Jessica? My poor girl is at the mercy of that gang of ruthless murderers. Yes, but we can't just let them slip through our hands and take the gold with them. That shipment was a payroll for the soldiers at Fort Bellamy, half a year's back pay. And we have to get it, as well as rescuing your daughter... and putting that outlaw behind bars. Have you got any suggestions? Let's try an ambush. Shoot 'em down without mercy. Of course, we have to be very careful to get them before they can hurt Miss Jessica. No... no... I realize that you men only want to do your duty, but Burt is dead serious. There's no doubt that he means to carry out his threat. If he suspects you're going to cause any difficulty... I know just what he'll do. He won't hesitate to kill my poor Jessica. Yes, I know. You're right. Listen, fellas, I think we ought to ride over to San Juan and have a talk with Captain Garcia... of the Mexican garrison. Maybe we can get him to set up a border patrol. Hopefully, they'll be caught when they cross the border. But meanwhile, we'll double the reward on all of them. It might help. You go ahead, I'll catch up. OK, Sheriff. Adios Amigo! -Who's he? -That is Sartana. We owe everything to him. For years, the village was poor and the people we starving... until he showed us how to start working this abandoned mine. We owe him everything. -Why is that? -Why? Because he is Sartana... He's a sort of lawman... but he's still got plenty to do. Hey, there, ol'fella. Anybody who live here anymore? Not even a blacksmith? Eh, forget it. Here. Sartana... What's new? Between bank robberies and kidnapping, I don't know where to begin. The Kelly gang is holding Jessica Brewster hostage. The poor girl, what she must be doing. They say they're not going to let her go unless they reach Mexico. Dirty coyotes... If you don't rescue her, Sartana, they may just murder her anyway. You're the one person who could do something to get Burt. Why don't you? Everyone in town would thank you. Just a second, I ain't going to play with you! You cheat more than me! You'd better teach him a lesson. He cheated you! Ramirez? Stinky? Where are you? This waiting is driving me crazy. Come on, you little wildcat. So you finally got back with that whore... All yours, boss There's nothing to be afraid of... Skip the romance, Burt. If we hang around here any longer we're going to run into trouble. It's time for us to move out. I didn't ask for any advice. Have you forgotten who the boss of this gang is? I'm in charge! And I'll decide when we're going to leave. What are you staring at? Got any objections? Burt! Boss. They're going to raise the reward money. They're offering fifteen thousand dollars for you and five thousand each for the rest. Shut up, imbeciles! Do you realize what that means? I tell you it's going to bring all the bounty killers in the country after us. Take my word for it, men. And that'll include that bastard... Django. But that ain't all, boss. I've seen Sartana, too. Sure as shooting he's headed this way. Well, what are you waiting for? Get out of here. Go after them. Go on! Kill them! Ya' hear? Kill them! What are you looking at? It's all your fault, understand? All your fault! Stop staring! I'll show you! Jessica! I ain't letting you get away from me. No, sirree. As long as you're with us, nobody will dare try anything. That's why I'm going to take you to Mexico. I guess you just had a run of bad luck this evening, Frank. Sucker, eh? I'll take his place. OK, stranger.. Shuffle 'em good, them cards. One dollar to start. Me too. Cut. Right, let's have it. A nice, friendly little game, stranger. Well, you're gonna open? Come on. OK, boys, I'll open.. I'll stay. Me too. All right, now. Two cards. -How many cards for you? -Give me one. -Three cards -And I'll take one. Well, boys? Let's say 30 dollars. -All right. -I'll go along. 50. I'll call. Full house. That beats me How about that... Some people have all the luck. Cut. Sweeten the kitty, boys. Come on. Hey, that's no way to deal. -Nothing -Pass. I'll open. Three cards, that's go. Two cards. Pass. Thirty dollars. I'll call you. -Your pleasure. -Pass. Full house. You win. Damn lucky... It looks as if you're all cleaned out. -Not yet. -OK then. I'm in. I'll open. I'm in. I'll play One card. -Two cards. -One. One dollar. I'll see you... Okay by me. What are you going to use for money? All of this? -Hey! What the hell!? -Wait, that's Django. I recognize him! -Django? -Django! I want to thank you for the game, boys. I don't care for crooked gamblers. Do me a favor. Buy them each a nice coffin. -We are all ready boss. -What are the orders, Burt? Stinky, I want you to go after Sartana with your men. Ramirez, go after Django. The only way to deal with those damn coyotes is to stop them before they reach here. Watch River City. They'll come through there on the San Juan Road. Hire all the extra gunmen you need, just don't let them escape. Get going, now! Get going! Go! Now! You never change, do you? You come in here and make yourself at home, take what you want, then leave. Without so much as a thank you. I don't ever want to see you again. You're just a good-for-nothing, low down snake in the grass. That's what... You hear? A snake in the grass. A good for nothing. I hate you. You treat me like I was dirt. Well, I've had enough. You skunk. You rat. I don't ever want to see you again. Get out of here. Get out. You bully. You bastard. Why did I ever have to fall in love with you? All you ever do is make me miserable. I know a real important secret, but I ain't gonna tell you. What do you know? Come on... Tell me everything. The sheriff has raised the reward for Burt Kelly. And I know where he's hiding. Him and the gang. All right. Where is he? At the big canyon. There with Miss Jessica. There is a whole bunch of them there. Good for you, smart girl. I suppose nothing will ever make you change. You, go over that way. Sartana is a tough customer. I don't want to take any chances with him. Jerry, you go see the Randall brothers, you better tell him I need some help, Right, Boss. I'll wait here. Don't waste any time. Be as fast as you can. Hey, Baquito. Ride over to Billy Rodgers and tell him we need him with his men. Django's a dangerous hombre. We don't want the him to slip through our fingers. Take a shortcut. We'll wait here. Howdy Randall. I hear you're setting out the ambush, that bastard Santana. We'll be glad to help you, the boys and me. I knew I could count on you Stinky. We can't fail this time. It's all planned. Let's head for River City. I'll explain as we go. Hey Amigo. Listen, we're off to get Django the bounty killer and we need your help. That hombre is cunning like the devil. Yeah, I know, -But I got a plan. -He's bound to go looking for us. The places everybody knows, Wide Rock or San Juan. But we'll be waiting to ambush him. You Billy, you'll wait at the wide rock with your men. I will go down to San Juan. We must not let him get away. -Is everything clear? - Sure. Let's be moving. You're in luck, Django. Very soon you're going to get a lot of gold. This card stands for wealth. Oh. And a very pretty blonde girl is going to cross your path, Not one you know already, Somebody much younger. Oh, dear. A terrible danger is approaching, and a dark haired stranger is on your side. There is no need to run away, girls. Now you, bartender, give me a drink. That'll do. You two take him upstairs. and tie him up, We'll leave at daybreak. You search down there, ask if anyone's seen him. Well, what do you think about it? Now that Kelly is clearing out... We're going to have a real fight to see who takes over the territory We gotta take care of our interests. Can't have the law running things like back East. Well, I hope it don't happen. Who you looking for? Any of you boys happen to see Sartana? Sure, he was hanging around the hotel an hour or two ago. -Ok. -So long, He can't be far off. Let's have a look in here. There he is. Don't move! Let's have some fun. That'll hold you for a while. Why don't you smile? At least pretend you like it? Remember, don't tell no one you've seen us here. Cosalito Cosalito! I got to wait for Ramirez and the others, then I'll come back to help you load the carcass. Yeah buddy, I got it. Don't take long. We have to be on our way before the day break. Adios, doll. Enjoy your sleep, because the next time it's for good. You dirty Mexican bastard. Get me a cup of coffee. Come on, hurry. What are you doing!? Get him! -Are you OK? -We got to get out of here. Rosalito? Django? Them girls! Ramirez! -Here take this. -Thanks. Get under cover, fast! Django! Don't move. You want another lesson? You've asked for it, only this will be your last. All right, give me that knife. Here. Here's your pistol. And your horse, Django. Thanks for your help, girls. Those carcasses are worth twenty thousand dollars. You can have the reward. It's for you. You too beautiful. On your feet! Don't move. Unbuckle your gun belt. Sartana, you bastard. I'm going to make you pay for that beating you gave me in the stable. Look at him. A hero of the West. We'll see how tough he is. Get him boys. That's it, boys. He deserves it. Here's another one for you. Come on. On your feet pretty boy. Take that, and that, and that! Before he croaks, we can use him... for target practice, Burt will be glad to hear this We're all through Sartana. All right, you know what to do. When you get tired, finish him off and leave the remains for the vultures. Giddyup. Well? I left the boys near White Rock Pass because I knew that you were here... waiting for me me to bring you the good news. We captured Sartana. And by now, he's feeding the vultures. Good work, Stinky. Here's Ramirez. How'd you fellas do with that bounty killer? We caught him at the saloon, down at San Juan, but someone... Sartana... helped him to get away. You fool! Our troubles ain't over yet. Django's on the loose and your men haven't come back yet. I don't like it. Look at me when I'm talking to you. There's a smell of death in the air. Why? Why didn't you kill him with your own hands? Why did you trust them? You should have sent me, not them two idiots. Insolent little jerk. You're no good coyotes, all of you! Django! Sartana! I'll hunt you down! I'll kill both of you. That's what I'll do! Just like that! Money is only good to burn. We got to be leaving soon. -And the girl? -Yeah. You Stinky, and you Frank. Take the girl out to Devil's Gulch. I'll join you there. Hold up. Go look up ahead. Make sure the coast is clear. Get going. I can look after the girl. Do you sense... Sorry, honey. You're too risky alive. Take it easy. That's a dangerous toy for a little boy. And I don't like kids who play with guns. Especially stupid kids like you I ain't no kid. I'm Silky. I'm Burt Kelly's brother. And I'm going to kill you. Well, you're free to go now. But you better watch your step. Fighting ain't over. Thanks you. Who are you? First village you come to ask the sheriff to take you back home. Take that road. It's the safest. Alright, everyone take as much grub with him as he can carry. You got that gang? What the hell are you doing? A rifle like this... is the best friend a man has, only you've got a know how to use it. Let's go! You stay here. You cover the road. You two take the cliffs. Don't let them surround us, hurry! Hands up, there, Kelly. Drop that gun. Not yet! So you think you can get the drop on me, huh? I'll show you. Down on the ground. Which gun will I shoot you with? Yours or mine, and where? Which? With the two. Right here in the eyes. Okay. Ramirez This one's mine. Stinky is yours. That one ain't worth nothing. It looks like you got the jackpot. No... They're all yours, Django.
