Hello? Good shot. Okay he's dead. Let's go get him. That's another one for the fire. Hello? Hello? Careful with that one, it's fragile. Put that one over there. That's right, just take that one into the living room. Great, thank you. Careful, careful. That one's really fragile. I know that one's heavy, but just, yeah. Take it over there. Still no sign of our mysterious neighbors? Nope. I put a note in the welcoming basket, though. Well, maybe they don't wanna be bothered. Aren't you curious about who moved in? I mean, how'd they'd sell the house so fast? They haven't even buried him yet. I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. That's how you do it. You're listening to Madison's most loved station with me, your host, Arlene Tucker for the Tucker Talk Show. Joining us now, children's author and illustrator, - Katie Gatewood. - Hi. Your husband, Dan, is an architect, right? He is. He draws houses and I draw people. So what are you doing for your next book? Oh, it's kind of a work in progress, but it's about a determined young boy. I'm sure our listeners are excited to read it soon. Which brings us to the big question, do you have a recipe for us today? Actually, I do. Eggplant parmesean. - It's in the oven right now. - Remember, we'll be uploading the recipe to our website. Thank you to our guest, children's writer and illustrator Katie Gatewood, for joining us. Thank you so much for having me. Eggplant parmesan. - In the oven right now. - You were listening. - Yeah. - How was I? Perfect. I think it went great. Me too, babe. - Where did you leave it? - I left it right by - the front door. - I'll be back. Thanks, babe. Find it? I got it. Ladies and gentlemen, join with me if you will in the Father's prayer for our dearly departed brother. Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Lily, I am so sorry. - Oh. You let me know if you need anything. Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Poor Lily. I wish I had gone over there that morning. Then you would have been the one to find him. And nothing would have changed. I know, but I just feel bad that she found him like that. Well baby, it's not your responsibility. I mean, how many times did you cook something for him and he never even touched it? Well, maybe he didn't like my cooking. Your cooking? Never. Oh. Is that Mr. Grimes? - Hello? - Oh, that guy is unbelievable. He squashed every project that you've ever been involved in. - I know. - I hate him. He has no appreciation for how talented you are. - I know. - And what's he doing right now? He's probably giving your project to the guy that just started last week. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it. Okay. - Well, he's done that. - See? - He's made me the boss. - So? Honey, I'm Chief Architect. Oh my gosh, congratulations. - Thank you. - Honey, he acts like you don't even exist. He likes my work. He's just got a funny way of showing it. See? I told you I always liked that guy. Uh huh. What's that smell? Oh, God! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Oh, no, no, no, no, babe, babe! Get the mitts, get the mitts! - Ah! - Here, hold on, hold on, hold on. All right, just set it over here, set it over here. Oh. Oh, no. I worked so hard on that. Here, let's clean this up. Oh boy. Looks like we're going out tonight. You think? I wouldn't worry about it, honey. We left the windows open, right? Yeah, but still. - Two pinots. - Thank you. Of course. Good night. I swear I left the oven on low. Babe, don't worry about it. These things happen. Besides, tonight we should celebrate. - Your new book. - I'm still trying to work out the ending, but, you know, I really wanted to write something about - not giving up. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - No, I love it. - Thank you. Cheers to your new book. To becoming Chief Architect. - To Mart. - To Mart. Good morning. Good morning. Mm, that looks good. Ah. I believe this is mine. And I believe this is mine, too. - I needed a red. - Uh huh, I'm sure you did. Just like you needed my favorite shirt. By the way, have you seen my pocket knife - in the bedside drawer? - Your man drawer? No. I made a point to never go in there. It's far too dangerous. I could have swore I put it in there. Well, if you see it, let me know. All right, I gotta run. Love you. Have a good day, Mr. Chief Architect. You, too. See you later. Hi. I've been meaning to introduce myself. We keep missing each other. Louisa. - Clover Drive. - Oh, yes! You moved into 170. It's nice to finally meet you. - I'm Katie. - Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too. I wanted to thank you for that fruit basket. - That was so sweet of you. - Oh yeah, just something small to welcome you to the neighborhood. You are gonna love it. It's friendly, quiet, safe. Well, I don't wanna interrupt your flow, so I'll leave you to it. Catch you later. Yeah. Hey, Katie. - How you doing? - I'm good. Thanks, Patrick. - Can I help you, ma'am? - Hi! - How are you? - Not bad for week two. I'm so proud of you. - The store looks amazing. - Thank you. - How was the funeral? - Small. Yeah. Oh, did you need more charcoal? No, but I do need liner pens. Oh, okay. I think I should qualify for a family discount. Oh you get a loyalty discount. You are my best customer. Just hopefully not my only customer. - It's only been two weeks. - I know. Liner pens, they're in the back. Come. One second! - Hey, there. - Hi! I just wanted to return the good deed. I made you a smoothie with the fruit you got me. Oh, thank you. Do you wanna go for a run? It's so nice outside. Yeah, I was just in the middle of yoga, - but let me just grab my shoes. - Okay, great. Here. You must get so much inspiration living in a place like this. Oh, I do. It's tough though, when you work inside and you wanna be outside all day. I know what you mean. - What do you do? - PR. - Oh, public relations. - People's reputations. Damage control, mostly. So is there a Mr. Louisa? - That's complicated. - I didn't mean to pry. Well, let's just say I'm trying to get over someone. - Oh, you just broke up? - You know, we never actually broke up? But when a guy can't commit after 10 years. 10 years! - That is way too long. - I know. He's worth it. So what about you? Who's the lucky guy? Oh, he's pretty amazing. He's kind, considerate, handsome. My sister says I talk about him like I'm obsessed, but... That's cute. He sounds practically perfect. - You'll have to meet him. - I'd like that. Ready? Mrs. Gatewood! Sorry I'm late. Had to go to a doctor's appointment. Mrs. Gatewood? Mrs. Gatewood? Hello? Alice? Oh, my gosh, Alice! Alice, can you hear me? Wake up! Oh my God. You're breathing. Stay with me, I'm gonna go call 911! We've lost her. Dr. Forest, dial 118, please. Dr. Forest. Hey, hey. These things happen. Who knew she had a heart condition? There's nothing you could have done. Wheelchair to the second floor nurses' station. Wheelchair to second floor nurses' station. So did Alice's family call? Oh, yeah. They're gonna hold the wake tomorrow. Oh. I told them you'd be out of town. Yeah, I hate that I'm not gonna be here, especially after all of this. I'll miss you. Oh, babe, I'll miss you, too. But you need this project to go well. And besides, I mean, if I need company, I have my sister here. Although her shop... It's not going well? I just wish I could help her bring in more customers. I don't know how. Yeah, well if I can do anything. Maybe it needs a layout change or something. - What about a workshop? - That's a great idea. I mean, that'll get people interested in the store. I'm sure our new neighbor would come. - She seems really sweet. - Oh yeah? What's she like? 50s and two cats and a collection of China. Try late 20s and hot. No way, in that house? You better sit down! You know, some guy's been stringing her along for 10 years? Yeah, well maybe she's just slow to take the hint. Or maybe he's just scared of commitment. Yeah, see, I don't get that. I mean when you want somebody bad enough, put a ring on it. Sure wouldn't have let you get away. You're still surprised I said yes. You better have said yes. I would have tracked you down and find you. So I've been thinking about what you said. - What was that? - About moving on. You said I should stop wasting time on losers who don't appreciate me. - I said that? - Well, maybe not in so many words. The problem is, I want what you have. - Which is? - A person who cares about me. Did we talk about Dan? - I want that. - Of course. I just feel like I'm always the one who's giving. When am I gonna get something in return? You so deserve that, too. I feel you. I'm so happy to have you all here, today. Thank you for coming into the studio to check it out. Whether you're beginners or advanced, I'm really excited to see your work. And feel free to exaggerate lines. You don't have to stay true to life. Sometimes taking risks pays off. Nice job. In fact, in my next workshop, we will discuss just that. How all of you can turn your passion into a successful business. But I'm afraid that's all the time we have for today. Thank you all so much for coming. Maybe I could come by tomorrow. Not quite yet. It's still a complete mess. Boxes everywhere. You know. Yeah, no, I mean, whenever's good for you. Now, if I could figure out my love life. Oh, go ahead. Hi. That's great. Yeah, we're just having coffee at Birch. It's Dan, he's right around the corner. Why don't you come join us? - You get to meet my Dan. - Amazing. I'm just gonna use the restroom. - I'll be right back. - Okay. - Hey, babe. - Hey. - So where's Louisa? - She just ran to the... Sorry, had to rush off. Urgent business call. Next one on me. That's weird. Yeah, what a shame. Yeah, it's weird. I used to date a girl named Louisa. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, stop! - Did you see who it was? - No. Nothing, just your bike on the ground. Oh, my God. - What happened? - It's okay. I'm fine. - You don't look fine. - I just fell off my bike. I mean, a few cuts and bruises, but I'll live. I'm sorry, you two don't know each other. Louisa, this is my husband, Dan. Hi, Dan. Well, you should probably keep an eye on her. A concussion can take effect up to 24 hours after a blow to the head. Yeah, I'm gonna take you to the hospital, now. Well, I'll leave you guys to it. Thank you. Come on, let's go. - You okay? - Yeah. See? I told you it was nothing to worry about. You almost broke your wrist. You're lucky it wasn't worse. Good thing Louisa came by when she did. Speaking of which, you could have been more friendly. It's not like you. Let's get you checked out. What's on your mind? You seem so distracted. Oh yeah, just work. Hey, you gonna be okay today? I'm gonna be fine. Well, I'll try to be home early. Hey, you sure you're okay, babe? Yeah. Stop fussing. - All right, I love you. - I love you, too. - Hi. - Hey, stranger. Look, I just wanted to come over here and find out, - well, ask you... - Ask me what? What are you doing here? Well, it's a beautiful neighborhood, isn't it? So it's just a coincidence? - I guess it is. - Yeah, now you're friends - with my wife? - Oh, she's lovely. Right. So what is it? So, why am I friends with your wife, - or why am I here? - No, why are you here? I needed a place to live. I fell in love with this house. - Uh huh. - Doesn't bother you, does it? No, it's fine. It's just, this is a good neighborhood. See you around. Neighbor. - Hey. - Hey, you taking off? Yeah, I was just about to text you. - I can't play today. - What's up? I gotta talk to Katie about something that came up. Oh, it's no problem. Just give me a call and we'll reschedule. Yeah, sure thing, man. - Have a good round. - Thanks, - see you out there. - Yeah. - Hey, where are you? - I'm just at the doctors getting checked out. Hey, can you meet me at the house in a half hour? Why? Because I need to talk to you. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everything's fine, I just had the locks changed. They left a key for you under the door mat. I'll explain later, okay? I love you. I love you, too. - Hey, babe. - Hi! - I got Chinese. - My favorite. - Those look great. - Thank you. Well, this is a rare treat. You home early for dinner. Well, I promised you I would be. You said we needed to talk? Yeah. Hold on one second. It's the office, I'm sorry. This is Dan. Oh God, he what? Yeah, no, I'll get there as soon as I can. Yep, no problem. Last minute client meeting. - Tonight? - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - No, no, I understand. I mean, big promotions come with new responsibilities. I just wanted to have a quiet evening with my wife. Talk to you about a few things. That sounds serious. - Should I be worried? - No. Honestly, babe, it's not a big deal. - I can help you pack. - That would be great. By the way, why did you have the locks changed? We left a spare set with our neighbor, and after he died and they emptied the house, I don't know who has them. - Better safe than sorry. - Smart. What is it? I need to talk to you about something. And it's probably nothing, but I don't wanna keep a secret from you. Okay. Tell me what it is. It's about Louisa. Louisa. - Next door Louisa? - Yeah, she mention me? - About last night? - No, no, before that. I don't understand what you're talking about. I used to know her. - You knew her? - We dated. - So she was your girlfriend? - No, no, no. Nothing like that. We went out a few times and it didn't really go anywhere. I mean it was years ago. How come you didn't just tell me last night? I don't know, I was in shock. She was right there in our house. She hadn't said anything. Can I ask how she ended it? Well, that's the thing is that she didn't end it. I did. Or, I suppose I should have. I should have told her it was over, but I didn't wanna hurt her feelings. So you ghosted her? I'm not proud of it. Well, I can just go over there and have a conversation with her. Find out what her intentions are. I don't know, babe. You think that's a good idea? Well, why not? I mean, she seems harmless. Okay. If you think so. Listen, thank you for understanding. I love you. I'm so glad you came this morning. Yeah, me too. Thank you for inviting me. - This course is beautiful. - No problem. So I've been meaning to ask you something. What? Well Dan, he told me that you two went out. He did, did he? I just wondered why you didn't say anything before. I thought it would upset you. It was years and years ago. And you guys have such a great marriage, I didn't really wanna bring it up. He did say he didn't end it too well. - I barely remember. - Like he never... We just, we stopped texting and talking. But like I said, it was so long ago. Plus, I have already met someone new. - Really? - Uh huh. Ooh, nice shot, girl. I thought about what you said about moving on, and this guy is cute, and smart, and we have been talking a lot. I hope I get the chance to meet him. Of course. So I mean, is everything okay with us? I would hate for this to spoil our friendship. Oh, yeah, no. I mean, it was nothing. Just like you said. I was thinking that we could get coffee sometime. - Catch up, you and me. - Yeah, I don't know, Louisa. I just, I don't know if that's such a, hey, Patrick. Yeah, I'll check with Katie and see if we're free. So how's the book coming along? Well, I'm halfway through the illustrations, and I'm working on the last few pages. Great, so you're almost done. Yeah, I would say just a couple more weeks. That's great. You know, I spoke to Louisa today. Oh, yeah? - How'd that go? - Good. I asked her why she had never mentioned that you two went out. Well, she said it was no big deal. She did? Well, you seem almost disappointed. No, trust me. I'm not. At the driving range, it's first come, first served. Great. I'm new to the area, but my really good friend's a member here, and says amazing things about this course. I'm sorry, what's your name again? - It's him, Dan Gatewood. - Oh. Well, his wife. Hey. - See who's taking the tour? - Yeah, I saw her. In fact, I'm seeing too much of her. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. What's the connection? She's our new neighbor. And she just dropped my name as a reference to the club. - Why would she do that? - She's your neighbor, man. What's the problem? Yeah, but I used to date her. Wow, really? Yeah, now I get the feeling she's just following me around, like she's still interested or something. That sounds like a nightmare. What are you gonna do? No clue. Well, you can change your friends, but you can't change your exes. Who are you? Yoda? - Don't make eye contact. - Too late. Louisa? You must be Finn. So, what can I do for you? Well, I guess that depends. Well, tell me what sort of things are you into? Nothing like that. Just to spend some quality time together. Two weeks. I need you to tell people that we're in a long-distance relationship and you just got back in town. - Think you can handle that? - Is that all? Yes. And you start tonight. Let's go. Okay. Oh, my God! - Patrick! - Are you okay? - What are you doing here? - I had to talk to you. It's about your husband and your neighbor. - Dan and Louisa? - Yeah. Look, I think you should know that they're... Dan already told me. I know everything. Thank you, though, Patrick. Thank you again for tonight. I really needed it after that little scare. Couldn't he just knock on your front door like normal people? Speaking of which, Dan had the locks changed. - Can you hold onto our spare? - Sure. - Hey. - Louisa. Hey, mind if I join? - Okay. - Great. Well, I was just leaving, actually. Another early start at the store tomorrow morning. Bye. - Night. - It was good seeing you. - You, too. - Oh, sorry. Gosh. So clumsy. That's okay. - Bye. - Bye. I'm sorry if I was butting in. No, no, not at all. I was just thinking it's late and I should - probably get home, too. - Oh, wait, can you just hold on a little longer? Finn will be here any second, and you did say you wanted to meet him. - Yeah, sure. - Great. I'll buy you a drink. - What do you want? - A ginger ale. Sure thing. - Katie, this is Finn. - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Her husband is working tonight, so it's just gonna be the two of us. Okay, well sorry for being late. I was stuck on the phone with a guy, he's trying to leave his wife, but doesn't know how to tell her. Men are the worst. Don't you think? Some can be. I'm so glad you guys could finally meet. Yeah, Louisa's told me so much about you. I've really been looking forward to this. Same. You're beautiful. Would you guys excuse me? I'm just gonna use the restroom. Sure. You're right, she's pretty. Just keep up the act. No problem. Hey, your daily smoothie. Are you okay? - My stomach. - What's wrong? I think it's a cramp, I don't know. Come on. All right, let's get you home. Ooh, slow down. You all right? Hey, Dan. Who's this? Well, it should be your wife, but she's not feeling too well right now, so I'm standing in for the day. I'll grab her for you. Hey, Katie, sweetheart. - Katie, it's Dan. - Katie? I was jogging and I collapsed. - I'm coming home. - No, I'm fine. Enjoy your golf. - Did you call a doctor? - I think it's a virus. - It should pass. - Here, let me take that from you. She's gonna have to call you back, Dan. Bye. What's up? This is the best carrot cake I've ever had. - You think so? - It was really good. Aw, you guys are too sweet. Hi, honey. You're obviously feeling better. Yeah, I took a good, long nap. You sounded really, really sick. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to concern you. This is Finn, Louisa's boyfriend. He's gonna be in town for a couple of weeks. - Dan. - Finn. Dan, would you like to try some cake? - No, I'm not hungry. - Maybe we should wrap this up. I just need to use the restroom real quick. Dan, I gotta say, your wife is an amazing artist. She showed me some of her stuff inside earlier. I am blown away. - I mean, truly inspiring. - You are far too kind. I'm sorry, how long are you in town for? Oh, just a couple weeks. But I'll be flying back and forth. I wanna spend as much time with Louisa as possible. And what it is that you do again, exactly? - I am in finance. - Hey. Hey. Well, like my wife said, we should wrap this up. - Dan. - Maybe we should get going. Yeah, of course. - Some other time. - Okay. Sure. I'm sorry, he must just be really tired. - Sure. - Don't worry about it. - We'll walk ourselves home. - Night. You really think it's a good idea to spend this much time with Louisa? What is wrong with you? I have never seen you like this before. I just wish you would have told me that Louisa was here with her boyfriend. - That's all. - You are working 24/7, - and you are constantly away. - It's my job. Your job? You're golfing all the time. - He's a client! - So what do you want me to do, Dan? Sit around and be at your beck and call? Now you're just twisting everything I'm saying. Which is what, exactly? What are you saying? Gatewood, Gatewood, Gatewood. What? What is she doing? Why is she stealing my name? Is Dan right? This ends now! Hey, what can I do for you? Well, I just got this in the mail. But there must be some mistake. It's yours, but it has my name on it. Oh, they do that all the time. They mix up the names, they Google the addresses. Thanks for bringing them over. I have never had that happen before. - It happens. - But it is yours, right? Not mine? Maybe you should call them and change the name. To avoid any, I don't know, further confusion. Sure. Right away. Are you okay? Sorry, my stomach's a mess. Must be the stress. I mean, I can't even be sure he's playing golf. You don't know that for sure. I know some of his clothes are missing. They could be still in the wash. That doesn't explain me finding some woman's earring in his toiletry bag. I thought we had the perfect marriage. I can't imagine Dan cheating on you. I mean, he's been distant, different. - Ever since... - Louisa? My advice. Be careful with your neighbors. Particularly ones who were once infatuated with your husband. I'm gonna go get the rest of the easels. Be right back. Welcome home. What is this? Just a little something to show my wife that I love her. Open it. It's beautiful. Right, but before you try it on, I have a confession to make. There was a pair of earrings to match. But like a dummy, I took 'em out to the golf course and I lost one. One sec. This one? That's the one. I love you. I love you. You guys have such a great marriage. I mean, is everything okay with us? I would hate for this to spoil our friendship. Hey, your daily smoothie. I don't know I want what you have. I want what you have. I want what you have. I want what you have. Katie? Surprise. Louisa. What are you doing here? I joined. - Didn't I tell you? - No. Oh, is everything all right? Fine. Are you sure? I've dropped by your place a couple of times. Are you not running anymore? I'm just taking a break. Resting. Well, we should catch up sometime. How's tomorrow? - I can't, I'm sorry. - Friday? Friday I'm working. My schedule's really packed. But I'll call you if anything changes. Is Dan still working those late nights? He's good. Can I ask you something? Yeah, sure. What's up? When you first met Louisa what happened? We met at a New Year's Eve party. We went out a few times after that. That was it. I don't know, I wasn't really feeling it. Do you think she was feeling it? Babe, listen. That was a long time ago, all right? There's nothing to worry about. I love you, all right? And we're about to have a party. Let's not do this, okay? No, you're right. - Let's go. - All right, we gotta get ready. So when are you opening your studio? - You are? - Yeah. What's the difference. - Making me a mojito? - Nope. I don't know how you girls drink this stuff. We're due over there in 10. You look absolutely gorgeous. I'm gonna get my purse. - Ready? - Yeah. - I got a thing for 'em. - For toes, yes. - It's sort of my thing. - I don't sway. You know like we have a son? - It's kinda gross. - Oh, I'll go. - Very sweaty. - Yeah. Itchy. We like itchy. Cough makes me itch. - Dan drags me out all the time. - Yeah? - Hey you guys. - He loves that. - I am so sorry we're late. - Yeah. - Yeah, well come on in. - Yeah. Thank you. Hi. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Hi, guys. - Hey. - Met you at the golf course. - Oh, that's right. It's so nice to see you again. - I'm Josh's wife, Hillary. - Hi Hillary, I'm Louisa. - This is Finn. - Hello. Oh, why don't you guys have a seat? - Sure. - Thank you very much. - I'll go get some plates. - Slide this down here. - This looks so good. - Mm. - Wow, this is lovely. - Kate's a wonderful cook. She is a fantastic cook. Have they finally all gone? Why, do you want us to be alone? No, Katie! Katie! Katie! Katie, let me in! That was not what it looked like, all right? Katie I was just washing the dishes. I thought it was you! I didn't know! Would you just let me in? Please? Katie I didn't do anything! I was just standing there washing the dishes. I thought it was you! Let me in! - Out of my way. - Katie, stop. - Katie, Katie, stop. - Don't even talk to me! - Where are you going? - I'm going to Mel's. - It's not what you think. - Good, because what it looks like is you two - tripping down memory lane. - I'm not interested in her. But she is interested in you. And you are happily encouraging her. - Why was she even here tonight? - I don't know, - I didn't invite her. - Well, you let her in. She was standing at the front door all dressed up. What else do you want me to do? - Are you enjoying this? - What? - The attention. - How can you even think that? Because that's what I'm beginning to think. What? You know what, Dan? You said you never finished it with her. Now's your chance. - Mel? - Are you kidding me? Katie, don't do this. Katie, Katie. No, Dan! Just... So the smoothie in the fridge. - For Katie, for your run? - I'm going to bed. Do you know what carpet cleaner can do when you drink it in small doses? - Good night, Finn. - It kills. I didn't sign up for this. - We have a deal. - No, we had a deal. I'm gonna need more money. Oh my God. What have I done? What have I done? Oh my God, no, no, no. Oh, God, okay. Oh. This wasn't the plan, this wasn't the plan. - Look, okay. - Katie! Okay, okay, okay. Okay. All right, okay. All right. Oh, oh my God! He's dead! Yes. 911, what's your emergency? Oh, my God, he's dead! He, he killed him. I think he's dead. So Miss Share, can you tell me what happened again? My neighbor Dan walked in on us in bed together, and he went crazy. - And the deceased? - Finn Cooper. My new boyfriend. Now, why would your neighbor kill your boyfriend? Honestly, it's all my fault. Why, ma'am? Dan wanted me to move into the house next door. To be close to him. I told him that it was a terrible idea. And then he came by last night? Yes. How did he get in? Well, he has a key. Oh. Now, you had been at a party next door? Right, but that was earlier. When I woke up, Dan was standing over Finn. And I tried to help him but then he struck me - and I blacked out. - Hmm. And when you came to? - Well, I called you. - Okay. Do you mind if Detective Evans and I - take a look around upstairs? - Please. Well, the guy was here for sure. His shirt's in the closet. They are nicely ironed. - They're not the boyfriend's? - Not his size. This guy's living some kind of a double life with two houses side-by-side. Well, there's a neighbor waiting to talk to you. Says the husband did it. Excuse me, sir. I'm Detective King, this is Detective Evans. You mind if we ask you a few questions? Sure. We heard that you know about the murder - that took place. - Yeah, they're clearly - having an affair over there. - They. It's Dan Gatewood and the new girl at 170. He parks his car over there so his wife can't see them. They spend all this time together. He buys her flowers and all this kind of stuff. And Katie won't leave the son of a bitch, 'cause he's got her under his thumb. She had bruises all over her the other week. So you've seen evidence of potential domestic violence? - Yeah. - Okay. Thank you, sir, you've been very helpful. Let's call the lab. If we can tie Mr. Gatewood to the crime scene, then we'll have enough for an arrest. Dan Gatewood? Yeah, what can I do for you? You are under arrest for the murder of Finn Cooper. Who? Put your hands behind your back. Go ahead and cuff him. You have the right to remain silent. - This is a mistake. - Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be assigned to you. Do you understand these rights as I've stated them - thus far? - Yeah. We'll take you down to the station for booking and processing. You guys are making a mistake. Well, your lawyer can talk to us about that. Right this way. - She's making it up. - So where were you at? I was at home. Can anybody confirm that? Your wife, maybe? No, my wife wasn't there. She left with her sister. Why did she leave? Because she thought that there was something going on with... Look, this is a set up! Dan, are you and Louisa Share in a relationship? What? No, no, never. I mean, we went out a few times, yes. But that was years ago! Are you sure about that? Because we found your clothes in her bedroom. - Are you kidding me? - Your last chance, Dan. Recognize this, Dan? No, no, no, that can't be. Because this was the knife that was used to kill Finn Cooper. Oh, my God. How did your fingerprints get all over this knife, Dan? I want my phone call. - Here you go. - Thank you. You're sure he didn't do it? Dan would have never killed Finn. Never. I just don't know how to help him. No, no, no, you can't go back there. That's not a good idea. What if you see Louisa again? You need some time to think. No, I can't just sit here. But you're right, I don't even have any of my things. I'll get them, you stay here. I'm taking your car. Together, we'll sort this out. It's gonna be okay. You do not go anywhere. Promise? Someone's gotta watch the store. We'll figure this out, okay? Dr. Forest, dial 118, please. - You keep fighting. - Dr. Forest, please dial 118. I know this is a difficult time. But if you're up to it, the Detective would like to ask you a few questions. - About my sister? - And your husband. Thanks. Well, Miss Share believes that your husband is trying to kill you so that the two of them - can be together. - Kill me? Nothing's going on between them. So you are aware that they had been involved before. It was just a few dates. We found traces of perchloroethylene and ammonium hydroxide in containers in your kitchen cabinets. Now, normally these chemicals are found in household cleaning products, but they are poisonous. So? So he could have put it in your coffee, - perhaps the food you eat. - The smoothies. Smoothies, sure. Now, your sister was driving your car at the time of the accident, yes? - Correct. - We have a witness who saw the other vehicle deliberately run at full speed into the car your sister was driving. Now, we think this could have been a professional hit that had been intended for you. Now, one of your neighbors saw that they saw Dan leave Louisa's home a couple of weeks ago. Do you know why he was there? I need to talk to my husband right now. Okay. - Hey, hey. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Did you ever go over there? Yeah, I went over there to ask her why the hell she moved in right next door. I didn't think it was just a coincidence. But then she assured me that it was. And then she started following me wherever I went. Like, she showed up at the grocery store, the golf course. She said she loved the neighborhood and that she fell in love with the house. I mean, what else could I do? - She's never gotten over you. - You think? We have to get you out of this mess. I should have never left that night. - Look, it's not your fault. - What did you do - after I left? - Nothing. I was at home. Which means I don't have an alibi. Look, I even texted you before I went to sleep. But what good is that? I don't know. I'll find something. - Some way, somehow. - Look, you be careful. She's dangerous. I have to go. - I love you. - I love you. I love you, all right? Louisa Share. Gatewood again? She's using my name everywhere. She's nuts! Who are you, bitch? Hello? This proves my husband's innocence. I mean, it's taped evidence he was home all night. Look at the time stamp. Our neighbor had the entire house covered with cameras. Well, this may be proof that he didn't kill Finn, but it's not proof that they weren't in on it together. I tell you what. Have a seat over there. Let me see what I can do. Oh God, oh, I'm so happy to see you! Okay, it's okay. It's over now. - Thank you. - Let's go. Just gotta run by the golf course and get my car. You look beautiful. Thank you. I gotta go shower. I'll be waiting. Mrs. Gatewood, it's Detective King. - Oh, hello, Detective. - Look, I wanted to let you know that we've issued an arrest warrant, but we haven't been able to locate her. - I haven't seen her. - We're looking for her, but in the meantime keep an eye out and consider her armed and dangerous. Well, Dan should be home any minute. He's getting his car from the impound lot. I gotta go, someone's in the house. What are you doing in my home? I know it's hard to hear, - but Dan and I belong together. - You're crazy. I know you killed Finn and Mart. I don't know what you're talking about. When are you gonna get it through your head? He doesn't want you! Miss? Please keep your hands where we can see them. Are you alone? Is there anyone else in the house? Miss, are you okay? Hey! Hey! Honey, what happened? I came home and she was in the house. And then she lunged at me and she was shaking me, and then I pushed her down the stairs, and she's, - she... - Are you okay? Hey, babe, are you okay? Yeah. 562! Cell block two, inmate 562. Inmate 562. Package for you. You guys doing okay over here? Yeah. More? Yeah? Everyone, I'd like to make a toast. First, to my sister. Congratulations on the business. - I'm really proud of you. - Cheers. We also have an announcement. - It's a girl! - It's a girl! It's a girl! Surprise! Gonna get started? - We have a play date. - You wanna watch.
