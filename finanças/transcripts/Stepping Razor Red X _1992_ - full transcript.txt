Vampires don't come out and bite your neck anymore. They cause something destructive to happen that blood will spill. And those invisible vampires will get their meals. Peter Tosh, 1987, the year of his murder. Long live Peter Tosh & Free-I. You are sound as a rock What as it was designed by Jah who was my creator... ..who sent me here to help... ..to alleviate the shitstem, the dirt the filth and corruption... ..that my people have been inoculated with it’s only my duty to teach those who will learn. From 1983 to 1987, Peter Tosh recorded the Red X Tapes. These tapes were to form the basis for an autobiography called Red X. He saw a red cross on every official document with his name on it. The tapes were uncovered in July 1990. These are the actual Red X tapes. That’s the beginning of my days at war the beginning of World War I... ...with the devil. It is only the truth that can make a man free, It is only the truth that can make a man live. The truth has been branded outlawed and illegal. It is dangerous to have the truth in your possession you can be found guilty, and sentenced to death. So irrespective of what men want to invent... ..Or try to imitate, because they cannot create They're only trying to invent and research and discover destruction So it was, so shall it be, and these are the last days. Reggae star Peter Tosh, and a man known as 'the doctor'... ..Were shot dead at 8:30pm last night at Peter Tosh's house. Five others, including JBC DJ Free I, were injured. According to the police, the perpetrators were riding motorcycles... ..to Tosh's house, and demanded money. Tosh and his guests were fired upon when they refused. The gunmen escaped. This case has the highest priority for the police. I knew that Peter was loved by everyone. I couldn't believe someone would do this to him. That he died like this... I had expected an accident earlier, because he always drove very fast. But because of a shooting I never expected. Nothing has become clear, except that it was a robbery. There were many rumors going around. In their youth, there was an incident that involved the police. He had a gun with him, and he also took the blame. Things changed at the station, and the other ended up in jail. When he was released, he felt that he had sacrificed himself for Peter. Lies. That's not true at all. Peter was a clean artist. Clean to the bone. I don't know the exact conspiracy story behind the murder. But the culprit they caught doesn't say anything. Apparently the real killer is from New York. Thats not sure. Rumor has it... ..that Peter wanted to start his own radio station in Jamaica... ..called Rasta Reggae Radio. That's why they had to get rid of him. He once told me he thought the state was after him. He would be shot, he was sure of that. But that didn't stop him. He preferred to die for the truth. I was not surprised when he died. I knew it was coming. There are always more sides to a story. They sometimes say three sides: yours, mine and the truth. Usually people try to pull the truth on their own side. But the truth stands alone. Yet everyone tries. I came from a poor family... ..who financially was not capable to give me a proper schooling. Nor proper education in low level. But at the same time my ambition, and determination in my hopes, and aspiration, my inner concept of creativity that was born in me showed me to help myself and I did. In this society I am classified as illegitimate but that does not make me lose faith within myself cause my mother was not married to my father. I never really knew it was my son. I couldn't know, I never saw him. And neither does the mother. I didn't know it was. Because of unfair financial condition... .. my mother was not able to grown me under her own nature and admonition. This is where Peter and I grew up, from the age of six. We lived here with my uncle, Euriah Campbell. He was very strict when it came to church. Go to church twice on Sunday, every evening during the week. When I was about seven years old I can not forget when the devil tried to blind me with barbed wire I heard my parents call running very fast I clashed with the wire two barbs could be three or more stopped in my eyelid right on the surface of my eyeball I wiped blood from my eyes I looked into the mirror and I saw where my two eyelid was slit open open so wide I could see through them that was one of the first major pit of destruction that the devil dug before my feet so I would not see the ails, the corruption, the filth, the shit, the destruction, the lies, the hypocrisy, and the order of the day My times when I came to the planet, there were fortress, the black people would be recognized as nobody For I’ve never seen a black lawyer, a black judge, a black preacher, we become like sheep with out shepherd, children without parents, students without teachers... born in the conflict of poverty, all we had was nothing, but because of the divine spirit that we was born and raised with it teaches us to multiply nothing with nothing and get something, zero with zero and get one. I never know that he could do so quick, until his school teacher tell me, that he can play the piano. Then we knew he was musically inclined. He sang in groups, the junior choir for example. He has been singing since he was four years old. He raised money with it. That was the time of the Pennies and Shillings, that's what he got. He use to sing Christian songs. And they started to teach me of the devil, and the Satan, and hell, they teach me of the Christians, but they make sure they teach me that Jesus was son of God, this white man When I ask why am I black, they say I was born in sin, and shaped in inequity One of the main songs we used to sing in church makes me sick, "Lord, wash me, and I will be whiter than snow." In my search I heard of the name God I go to church and they say, God made man of his own likeness and image If I made a doll in my image it is quite obvious that the doll must look like me, yet still I am faced with the ignorance, lost into fantasy seeking to find the reality in what they taught me, of this illusion of God I didn't like the blood business. I hate blood. And every time I hear them talk about the blood of Jesus I imagine how much of my blood they would like to see shed because if them shed at Jesus blood so, imagine who praise him All of these things really came down to what the black man can draw on, and what he came back to be able to draw on was a sense of himself through religion, A sense of expressing cultural assertion in an environment where black man's culture was just continually being supressed, In a sense, he fell back on the religion and religious symbolism as a mode of survival, The church thing he manipulated, than assimilated Christianity really didn't mean much to him. It was a way of convincing the slave master that he was now civilized, could deal with his idiom, but at the same time master it, hence his attempt to translate that into musical forms, that mystified the white man and blew his mind, that's what Peter is all about! My words stand for the truth, and it is painful. And I don't care what people have to say about me. For without the truth there is no consciousness. I was singing at the age of two, when I was five I made my first guitar, I was learning piano music at the age of thirteen, and if I only had the opportunity of having my own professional instrument, I would play the songs that angels sing. I came to the city of Kinson, which is called Kingston, It’s the first time of me being on my own, leaving under my parents jurisdiction, it was a new era in my life, A whole new page turned over, cause this was totally different from what I grew up with in the country The most dangerous things I ever heard or seen in my life, is when I find myself in Trenchtown. I see a many people, many youths in general, become victims of the shitstem, I see them die, I hear them cry. How the pain, the agony they bear, many I see die, because of impatience, I see many get frustrated, hallucinated, kinky, crack, nuts, crazy, walking out of themselves, lost into fantasy seeking to find the reality, and I see myself in the same similar shituation. I grew up with Peter being in our house. Peter used to bathe me, and comb my hair. He was the oldest in the house, older than my brothers. He gave me... He said to me... ..that I didn't have to worry. He would protect me. Tosh was a man who believed in spirits. Even in evil spirits. One night he lay in bed and couldn't get up. As if he was being held back. I was attacked by evil forces, seen, spiritual evil forces that caused my mouth to cease from function, caused my hands and legs to cease from moving. It was only my mind that was at function and my two eyes, and I was on the brink of what you call DEATH. It started with him when he came to live with us, in his teens. I was wondering if I was paralyzed. At that moment it caused me to make some inner communication, cause that was the last resort, so I made some inner communication and that inner communication caused me to get more confidence, that there is a creator that dwells within man seen. So I begin to ask him this question, what must I do, ask, what must I do? "Just lie down and get up and tomorrow man I'm dead?!" The spirit say 'move your bumbaclaat!' Me say what? He say don’t hesitate you’re on the countdown, in the countdown it’s like a hard three, two, and when one, as I say, move your, when I say BUMBACLAAT! It just fly out like bam! Immediately every spell was released. in Jamaica using the word bumbaclaat, is like, using the F word here in America. That's why these guys said this thing is indecent language. So that them can release their vampires on you. And if you don't have that spiritual communication and counteraction, you go to heaven with your big toes tied. It's the ghetto. It's the art of the Jamaican ghetto. Jamaican ghetto is... I don't know if the ghetto is the same all over the world, but in Jamaica there's nothing there. We're talking about dirt, dust. Each one have to help one, or every man for himself. The only thing we have in the ghetto that's for everyone is the inspiration of the almighty God. Then Peter came to live with me. Then he heard the music for the first time. I helped him... They didn't come up with one kind of song. Not just those happy songs. Those songs that calm you down. If someone has come up with a nice song, he sings it at the market. There are as many flavors of music as there are people. We often practiced songs from the Impressions. And about the time of Curtis Mayfield. We often practiced American music. Bob, Bunny and Peter were more than just a band of musicians. They really lived and trod like blood brothers. You should know that Peter's son, Andrew Tosh... .. always had to call Bunny 'uncle', Andrew's mother was Bunny's sister. And Bob's sister Pearl, was also Bunny's sister. So the circle was complete. It wasn't just a bunch of youngsters, they lived for the music. In Coxsone it seemed quite professional, but they weren't exactly pros. So he told them to stay with me and he will tell them when they're ready. The Wailers was that in my opinion, I needed to convince them the ability for each person, to be able to account for himself in a Wailing form. First tune hit, second tune hit... ..third tune hit. We never sing no tune that miss. To be a Wailer you have to cry. You must have been through troubles, temptation, humiliations and aggravation, police brutality. How much of them have ever go through that, how much of them ever been to jail, how much of them really been humiliated? How much of them ever been executed. He was the man with the guitar. He was the one who would insist... on the harmony pattern. The melody. Bob, Bunny, other persons, came up with melody and lyrics, but the person, who would strum out those initial chords was Peter. All them time we get three pound a week. When it reach time for royalty we must get 300 pound. But then him tell us how him have to draw back his 3 pound a week. And so work down to nothin'. -Peter Tosh I wanted to teach them about Rastafari, about the music industry. They were dissatisfied about being ripped off by people who were named managers. I wanted them to do their own business. They needed a little guidance. And come to the elders accepting direction, guidance. If you have talent, and the will to become an artist... ..you have to be open to that, and also teach them things. Word, sound and power... Word, sound and power are symbols of man. That's what we use amognst Babylon. We don't use a stick, nor a stone nor a gun. I done tell you that our policy is non-violent, non-political! The government was totally against the rastamans presence. The society had teach the people to hate, to ignore the rastaman. We had to watch for the police, come in and destroy us. They catch us on the street and cut our dreadlocks. Talking about fear, fear was only one of the way, of trying to eliminate the lion from the society, but that was one of the weapons that they tried to make him destroy himself with, there was many other ways and plots. And then when I investigated the fact I found out that this black heart man was the rasta man, the man of peace. The man of love and tranquillity, within his heart the man that teaches good to his people, teach them to love each other. I don't eat fish because I don't trade one life for another. The fish lives as much as I do. Rasta is all about living a good life. Yellow, pink or blue, all people. The man that was so humble sometimes I feel embarrassed to see how humble they was. They will smoke the herb of the earth. He smoked it until his eyes were as red as fire. And him smoke until his eyes become as red as a flaming fire. Seen. Even though his eyes be so red, from his mouth come the words of wisdom, that will be so uplifting. From out of this dark continent come forth prophets. So a message we brough to earth is, Come together, sister, brother, time gliding on. Here the voice of Ethiopia calls everyone. Ethiopia is for anyone that will accept. I was raised in the society of poverty, where I saw the innocent being humiliated daily, dying for being poor, so poverty was a part of the crime in our society. Poverty was designed, designated, by bureaucrats and the politicians, and leaders of churches and states, to see to it that the rastaman stay in the category of poverty, and want and needs, so he will break down and start to commit crime. But then again when I look around me in Trenchtown, all I see was poor, ambitious people, who had the ambition and the integrity, and the divine qualities sometimes and dignity of a millionaire. Because the music comes from pain and suffering, high loyal and dignified, majestic vibes, you forget everything around you when you listen to it. Music soothes all pain, like some kind of heavenly plane you reach. This is especially true with rasta music, because it goes according to the heartbeat. It comes from the heart. I think Bob Marley, being a son of a white man, and his mother being black, also that Chris Blackwell was a Jamaican, that there is a connection between black and white. I think Chris Blackwell realised this because Bob Marley was equal to the white man as to the black. It's like he's a, striking emblem of unity which is necessary. But I don't think Chris Blackwell used it in that form. We know those Satan’s and those devils they have been there for a long time, and I am m sick and tired of their bullshit, what they’re trying to do is create conflict, seen, what they’re trying to put, to create, between us is superstars, seen. and divide us, and make us look like we are rivals. Bob Marley was my student and he was always my student, from the first time he put his fingers on a guitar, seen, we were a group together, one went one way, two went the other way. For us, success was being together. As one. Bunny, Peter, Bob, all of we together. But when some left, everything went down, I think it was downhill from then on. When I left the group, there are people who said that I am in conflict with Bob, or some kind of madness, which its not a matter of being in conflict with Bob, it is just a matter of being in conflict with the shituation that I live all my life approximately seen, and it definates my character, belittles my authority, underestimate my ability, and me could not stomach that for another twelve years. Bambarass…So you can imagine where I was at? I had was to have faith, both in myself and in the almighty. And ask him, to cool the tempest, so that I might be able to write safely, and accomplish my mission. This was created by the creator. It has spiritual, botanical agents. It's tetrahydrocannabinol. Its anti-fungal, anti-viral and a pain reliever. We struggled to make the first record without any money. It took, almost two years to make this one record and find a record deal, It kept falling through and not happening for one reason or another, people were afraid of Peter, didn't know how to deal with him. ..And Jah created it for the motivation of the mind of man. To relax the mind of man, and its to do everything, pertaining to the upliftment of the mind of man, and to motivate inspiration. More light. Selassie I. As a connoisseur, which variety do you like best? Sinsemilla. Lamb's breath, king's breath, I also like goatshit. There's a feeling that if herb were legalised in Jamaica, it would turn the country into a sort of outlaw agronomy. bullshit. -You think so? Herb is being sold in Jamaica. Nine out of ten Jamaicans smoke herb. I mean the whole United Nations thing. Fuck the United Nations! If herb was a thing growing in the bloodclaat United Nations, do you think Jamaica could tell the United Nations what to do? Light up your spliff, light up your chalice, Come make we bun it in Buckingham Palace, Give me some paper, give some Rizla. Come make me run away all the vampires. Light up the spliff, light up the chalice, Come make me run away all the vampires. "If I wasn't a singer I'd be a bloodclaat revolutionary. I'd be killing bumbaclaat wicked everyday." Peter was sort of Malcolm X, the way he expressed himself. He didn't necessarily pick up arms, but his arms was his lyrics. He was seen as dangerous because of his harsh statements. The system don't like to see that. Well the police wanted to get him. I heard a lot of policeman say, virtually, I'd like to take this man down. He ran afoul of the law many times, he was brutalised by the police. Out of one spliff, almost beaten to death. It was like I was born in South Africa, because the environment that I was born in, the philosophy that they preaches inoculates the youth, African youth, with inferiority complex, in as much as I was taught that when you’re white you’re perfectly right, when you’re brown you can stick around, but if you’re black, stay in the back. Every morning going to school, my grand-aunt used to wake me up, and she would almost want me to comb my hair, and if I was even combing my hair for fifteen hours, when I finish it would be the same, and they would always curse and say, natty pat head boy. I been through world War I, and I’m going through World War II. This is Jamaica, a lush tropical paradise with rich land. Unemployment is more than 30 percent, and it's getting worse each day. Violence has broken out. Tanks patrol the trouble spots. Where in the past several months, at least 22 have been killed, in shootings associated with the elections this fall. Peter stood outside the two political sides. No side could get to reach him. And now Jamaica is headed into another election campaign, with prime minister Michael Manley's People's National Party arranged against Edward Seaga's Jamaica Labor Party. The average Jamaican struggles to get by every week. Can't get worse than this. Only death is worse. I'n'I come like lightning and thunder to break down these barriers of oppression, drive away transgressions, and rule equality between humble black people. The people are so afraid of terrorism... ..that they have barricaded the roads. Gunmen attack the neighborhood just like that, and they are almost never caught. Then all the leaders of the so-called gangs gathered... ..and they realized there was no point in fighting each other anymore... ..and killing each other. They decided to hold a peace truce with a concert. Bob Marley would be the headliner. Peter didn't understand what he meant by peace. His view was quite different from what the rest thought about it. This concert is a peace concert. And I would never come here. Do you know why not? Because it's a peace concert. And I wonder if there are people who know what peace means. Peace is the diploma you get at the cemetery. More people have died since the peace treaty. Yes. I made a speech... ..after I see the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader. Jamaica has been struggling for ages... ..under colonial, imperialist rule. It doesn't take into account what's going on right now. The government have to know that they have a whole lot of evil forces to fight. The devil is a dangerous guy. Peter was brilliant in exposing the standard, the double standard. Columbus and Drake call us pirates, which is how they put us in the textbooks... ..and let's learn that, how to behave like pirates. So it makes sense that the youth get so violent. For some reason, whoever brings his vision clearly is... ..the one who gets killed. I must be the one to set up this country and overthrow the system... ..so that blacks don't live in confusion, because hunger breeds aggression. Politicians must work together to make something of this country. What they are doing now makes no sense. People are starving. The system only belittles the poor. Only the poor get into the cell. I saw that myself. Only the poor are tried, so the system has to change. He was not a recording artist coming to make a few songs. He's a guy coming in with a message, he lived his message. He lived his image, he was his image, and he was his message. Peter was a soldier. He never compromised his music. He had a message to convey. And in that he was straight forward. He used reggae as a weapon for the future. We had to appear serious, and he brought it. I've been brutalised by police. Not because they know that I am a criminal or I am doing subversive things within society. But because I speak the truth. And corruption can't stand that. Do you think it's related to your speech at the One Love concert? Are you thinking of a direct connection? - I'm sure it is. They threw me in the corner and came at me with their weapons. There were eight or ten of them. Two or four of them couldn't do what was done to me. The eight of them mistreated me. -On the desk? With the door closed, no other people around. Were they in uniform or plainclothes? - Plainclothes. They chased others away and hit my head for an hour and a half. Then it occurred to me that they wanted to kill me. When I pretended I was dead... ..they said: Yes, he is dead. Earl McGrath of the Rolling Stones contacted me... ..and Mick came to Jamaica. -For One Love? For the peace concert, yes. Mick liked my performance, and we discussed forward-thinking things. I remember our first performance in Philadelphia. There were as many as 120,000 people, and a small group of Jamaicans. I remember watching the audience... ..and saw all those blond heads. The place was filled. People threw everything on stage. A bottle came straight at me, and Peter caught it just in time. Peter shouted through his microphone: What the bumbaclaat is going on here. 250,000 people, quiet as a mouse. You could have heard a pin drop. And then we quietly moved on. And then we announced the Stones. Suddenly it was like releasing millions of balloons. The whole audience stood... ..and then they came up. We thought: This is what Rock 'n' Roll is all about. How much do we do with them? -10 concerts. Will they replace your own band? I have my own band. -So the Stones come up after you. So it was with Stevie Wonder. -Now Peter Wonder does it too. This was another contract that Peter didn't quite keep. He had his own way of making record deals. I know the potential of my music and my music must be played and respected, the way any other white bullshit is respected, where I don’t care if it is culturally or morally uplifting to the people, and if the society is not concerned with upliftment well just let me know, and let me back out because I will go to Africa or Japan or China, where more people are more culturally and morally awakened. His wasn't understood by those who tried to interpret his message. This of course creates infinite complications when the prophet is deeper than his time. All the sheep and the fowl have scattered themselves, and everyone suffer from this great thing called 'ego'. everybody is busy involving his self. The respect of humanity has been lost, seen. No man respect his fellow man again. But this time the truth shall swim like waters covers the sea. And only righteousness can exalt a nation. If it wasn't Bob Marley it wasn't reggae. So Peter fought hard, to bring his reggae to the world. "Robert Nesta Marley, he was presented with the order of merit a few weeks ago by the Jamaican government..." When Bob died, I had to announce it to the radio stations. But because of Peter, Bob and Bunny's close bond, I decided to call Peter first. So I called him and said, I'll let you know first. Then he said, so be it, now we have the space to move on. The truth is I was born with fear, lots of fear, for the evil that exists around the 360 degrees, but there is something within me that was born inside me, that is called determination. and I know it has more power than fear. Why do you think militant artists pose a threat to the people? Because their works are corruption, and where there is corruption there must be an eruption. Irrespective of what bureaucrats are promising the people, and politicians, they are always promising good, but doing the most dangerous evil. I saw that a lot in my youth, all the people get these comfortable promises, for a thousand years and a generation come and a generation go and no promise is accomplished. Peter and Free I had something in common, they both believed in the blackness, uprising, in the uplifting of black people, and black consciousness levels. Free I had put in an application, to get control of JBC Radio 1, to buy it out. Free I was almost certain now, as long as they decided not give it to a foreigner. And Peter supported him. He made sure that the rasta remained. Black. It had to stay that way. That music had to be played. The teachings of black people, by Malcolm X, Martin Luther King. The government did not want to give it to Free I and Peter. They'd perfer to give it to someone else. Jamaican society is not really ready, to have Rastafari so projected, on such a serious medium. Listen. This one, is from a brand new album: Mama Africa. This one is called: Not Gonna Give It Up. He became overzealous. His spirituality actually overtook him, and he knew that there had to be, a Satanism thing going round, that would always want to devour God's people. It's not a Michael Jackson bumbaclaat element. Don't even mention a Prince element. Or a bip bap bumbaclaat element, it's too, it's too black for them. And when I get upset I don't worry about English grammar... ..because that gets me very upset. And do you know why? I will not sing "Darling, for you I conquer the sea and the mountains." I don't change. Because... .. I make short work of the bullshit. People will demand the truth. People have had enough of this bullshit about "shaking your butt." Or "Darling, I love you so much," you hear that 24 hours a day. A man who sings: Darling, I love you. A man wouldn't sing to the Almighty. Him love the woman more than the creator that created the sun, the moon, and the stars. I'm sick and tired of hearing that bullshit! When he had an ulcer... It was discovered around 1984. Then he took a rest. Before he went to Africa, he came to tell me that he could no longer sing. So he wanted to go to Africa, to clean up the act. So one of the things he told me was of being very impressed, with the magical and mystical powers of the medicine men there. Especially one gentlemen who introduces him to roots, which, if used in a particular way, and taken on a particular day perhaps, with the sun in a particular direction, You could magically have the power to change your form. He told me quite convincingly that this African doctor took the roots, transformed himself into a tiger, into a serpent, and then back into man. He told us that Peter would have to make a sacrifice when he gets back to Jamaica. Then Peter wanted something... This is true. Peter wanted something that would protect him from bullets. If you live in a small country where everything is there, the good and the bad... .-you sometimes get things mixed up. According to the bible you must be wise as a serpent, and harmless as a dove. That means you protect yourself. There is elements out there, there is evil. But if you're a rasta, you don't have to think about that. People sometimes come to warn us about rumours. For example, if someone says: Peter and you are going to die... ..and nobody will know about it. Then Peter would say: Me, dead? That's not possible at all. I saw peter in an ice box. And many other people died around him. So I can't help but say: The flesh is dead. She was someone within in his house, in his life, whatever... ..who took care of him because she cared for him. She helped him because of their strong bond. She didn't do it for her own benefit. She did it for them together, they were one. I knew something was wrong. He once told me on the phone... .. something that still bothers me. He told me that he had a fear, a serious fear all the time that someone was out to hurt him. She awoke this whole duppy (ghost) part in him. Knowing that Peter was a man that was always speaking about ghosts. If you wanted a story from Peter, he fills it with ghost stories. When he bought his house in Plymouth, he said 49 ghosts lived there. And he said he would chase them all away. She had got blood, believing to be an, Obeah (witch), or some bullshit. I'm one of those people who would do anything for Peter. If I see that someone is bad for Peter, I immediately send them away. For a long time they robbed Peter to pay Paul. That happened all too often, wanting me to just work, work, work. Work every day and then spend your pension on the doctor. I am not into that. I'm not here to live up to anyone's expectations. People accept that bullshit, I can't stand it. This is the last year of me being treated that way. It's only a pity that the few true fans I have out there, won't be seeing me in the western hemisphere, because I am tired of being abused. You could work for an independent label. They know that feeling. He was a man who always showed that he knew himself... ..until his other side showed himself. Then he switched. And at the last minute, he really made a switch. As soon as you get scared of the ghost... ..then comes the ghost. That's how it goes. I was in close confrontation with the devils. I could see them face to face. I see them feed upon their brothers flesh, like the fowls of the air feed upon the dead meat of the earth. I see everything that is deadly upon creation, arranged to assassinate those who speak the truth. This business has a long reputation... ..of guys who are bad and sometimes they like to hang on to artists. I spoke to him right after. I asked him why he killed Peter. That was in prison. He said: I didn't kill him. He gave me shelter... ..the shoes I'm wearing I got from him. Why would I? My dad knew what kind of character he was. A man that spent 13 years in prison for killing cops... .. That's not an easy guy. What did he buy when you got out? -A bed. I heard you grew up together, and knew each other for a long time. Correct. I've known him since I was a kid. We were like brothers. I don't know what happened. I have nothing to do with it. I was stunned when I heard it. He can say he wasn't there. But then I would never have been shot. They had no masks on. They say it was a robbery, but they didn't take anything. So I wonder if it was really a robbery. Michael let him in as a friend, because that's how he knew him. I saw them draw guns. They put a gun to my neck and sent me upstairs. We went upstairs to the living room, where Peter, Marlene... ..santa and Doc were watching TV. I saw Michael come up the stairs with wide eyes. Then I saw three men coming behind him. Then they drew their weapons and we had to lie on the ground. Then we all lay down on the floor. At first, I thought it was a joke. I thought that because there were often funny jokes played. At first, I was shocked. I thought they were cops, because of their clothes... ..and neat haircuts. They didn't seem like rough figures to me. When everyone was laying down, I was still sitting up. I was still sitting and then they forced me to lie down too. I started to pray. Leppo started talking about money. Marlene wanted to answer but she wasn't allowed to... ..because she would be the instigator. -This is where it happened. This bloodstain is from Doc Brown's injuries. And here you see Peter's bloodstain. It was an eerie feeling. The house just looked... Call it woman's intuition... But when I knocked twice I heard Marlene's voice. We couldn't figure out exactly what she was saying. Run away. Don't come in. One was afraid I would run away. He told me to keep quiet. When we came up we saw everyone lying on the ground. And there were two men with guns. He searched the kitchen and found a machete. He said he would cut off Peter's head if he didn't give money. Then he walked over to Peter. Then Marlene jumped up to stop him. One of them said to Peter: Tonight you will die. You could tell he was on drugs. I wasn't allowed to lift my head. I got gun butted trying to see what was happening to Free I, The last thing I remember was Peter saying... 'I have no money. I really don't have any money at home.' That's all. I haven't heard anything about deals that weren't paid. I don't care. I know they were sent. They shouted, Peter, you're going to die tonight. I'll never forget. "Reggae super star Peter Tosh, and another man known as 'Doctor' were shot dead in his home at 8:30 last night. Five others, including disc jockey Free I from JBC Radio... ..were shot. According to the police... ..three gunmen on motorcycles went to Tosh's house, demanding money. Tosh and his guests were fired upon when they refused. The gunmen escaped." Peter Tosh died at University Hospital shortly after arrival. Doc Brown died on the scene. Free I Dixon died in hopsital 3 days later. "At the National Arena, in the capital Kingston... ..the Jamaican people mourn the loss of yet another of their reggae super stars." It is something you will never completely forget. To get over it, I wanted to go back to this house... ..live into it, and face it. Two of the killers were never identified. It is said they were killed in the streets. Leppo surrendered, for his own protection and was convicted in the shortest jury deliberation in Jamaican history 11 minutes. Leppo has appealed his death sentence to the Privy Council in Britain. He maintains his innocence to this day. You see a friend's face, not his heart. So... ..anything can happen. When he was a baby, he cried a lot. Then when they called me, I said: Let him cry, I want to hear him sing. I didn't know he was going to be a singer. When I look into the blue water of the ocean, I see the truth. when I look into the skies, I see the truth. When I fill my lungs with fresh air, I feel the truth. It is only the truth that can make a man free. It is only the truth that can make a man live. Every form of victimisation is universal. Not only in Jamaica. But because I live in Jamaica, I see many youths become victims of the shitstem. The Father gives me the inspiration to sing the music because he says: "I call upon the singers and the players of instruments, all my springs are in thee." That means I'm here to play the music and communicate with the Father spiritually, so I can inspire to make music to awaken the slumbering mentality in people.
