THE 7TH DAY My mother and I left the village and never went back. Meanwhile my father stayed, probably for good. He'll die and be buried there... ...in his village. We have a view of the sea now. I have a decent-paying job. We're not rich, but we're getting by. They say time cures all... That I don't know. Yes, it's true. The names and faces fade away... ...and you see things differently... ...as if they'd happened to someone else. Strange as it may seem... ...it all began as a love story. My uncle, "Gorgeous" Amadeo, had caught the eye of... Luciana Fuentes, from the Fuentes family. He was Luciana's first love and she was head over heels. They say Amadeo seduced her and later jilted her... ...that Luciana never married and was scarred for life... ...that her blood dried up and she went mad. I hope you die, you son of a bitch! Amadeo Jimenez! They say she put Jeronimo up to it. And later her brothers. No one knows the truth. Villages are full of rumors... ...and things people keep silent. Jeronimo Fuentes did kill... ...my uncle Amadeo, and later fled. For what? A scrap of land on a property line, long fought over by two families... ...his family and ours. They say he ran for two days and two nights. They caught him at the edge of the province. He was tried and convicted for first degree murder. He got thirty years. A lifetime. Antonio! Antonio! The house is on fire! The house is on fire! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Mother! Mother! Mother! Get out! Get out! Luciana! The pigs! Out! Out! Go on! Out! Out! Go on, get out! Luciana! Mother's burning! Mother's burning! Mother's burning! Mother! I can't believe we're just leaving. Have you no sense of pride? They torch our mother and run us out of town! They're not running us out. We're leaving. We're not wanted here. Let's go. Come on, we'll be back. They left the village... ...but didn't go very far. And they never forgot. For years they held a grudge, fostering their hatred... ...as they waited... ...like a predator waiting for the right moment to strike. ♪ A patio in Seville strewn with flowers... ♪ ♪...a fountain in the middle with a spout. ♪ ♪ Roses and carnations of all colors... ♪ ♪...prettier than any painter could dream. ♪ ♪ Behind the iron bars on the window... ♪ ♪...sits a young girl with bronze skin. ♪ ♪ At her side, a dark and handsome... ♪ ♪...young man speaks longingly. ♪ ♪ The warm, silvery moon... ♪ ♪...bathed the patio with its light. ♪ ♪ And softly in her ear... ♪ ♪...the young Andalusian whispered: ♪ ♪ "Rocio, oh my Rocio... ♪ ♪ A bunch of carnations... ♪ ♪ A bud in full bloom... ♪ ♪ Just thinking of your love... ♪ ♪ I'm losing my mind. ♪ ♪ Because I love you, my darling... ♪ ♪...as no one ever has. ♪ ♪ Rocio, oh my Rocio... ♪ - You like the dress, Antonia? - Yes, very much. You look beautiful. Hold still, I need to hem it. How pretty. Have a kiss. Did you know Jeronimo got out of prison? Looking back, everything seems like a sign. Even the smallest things take on meaning... ...and become part of the tragedy. - The Body of Christ. - Amen. The Body of Christ. As soon as he got out, Jeronimo Fuentes... ...went looking for my father. Jose Jimenez! This is for my mother, you bastards! Mom thought he would die. We all did, but he survived. The doctor said he had tough skin and he'd been lucky. I don't see anything lucky about it. I didn't expect you back. At least not so soon. You lasted less than two months. So now what? You don't want to talk? Well... ...that's all right. I can wait. But that was the past, things were different. Mom always said tragedy is like a bad dream. You just wake up and dream something nicer. I was young enough to believe her. Try and catch me, Lucia! Encarna, stop! Let her go. Where can she go? That's true. This town's so small nobody could get lost. I wish I could go to Madrid. Madrid? What for? To see famous people. Soccer players and singers, like on TV. My cousin in Madrid's never seen a singer. She must not be looking. That must be it. - Who are those girls? - The Jimenez girls, silly. My God, how they've grown! And they're so pretty. I can't believe how time flies. Good grief. That boy is sick in the head. Very sick in the head. Do it like this, you see? It's easy enough. Though I'm in pretty bad shape. Meat that arrives before the 15th goes there... ...meat that arrives after the 15th goes in back. - You got it? - Yes, Mr. Jimenez. Stop saying "Yes, Mr. Jimenez, no, Mr. Jimenez." Just say yes or no. - No, you stay here. - Yes, Mr. Jimenez. Shit! Son of a... What is it, Daddy? That boy's dumber than a dead mule, that's all. We can check the books now. How's that going? I need the papers ready for the buyer on Thursday. What buyer? Are you going to sell? That's no concern of yours. Just handle the books. I'm finished. Except for the Romero bill. Right. Fine, you can go. You're in my sun. Sorry. Isabel, what are your plans this summer? Sunbathing. Seriously. Are you going anywhere? Maybe to the beach. Yeah, right. To Marbella with the rich folks! So you're staying here? What do you care? Of course I care. Oh, yeah? Hey, was I talking to you? Then keep quiet. Go play somewhere. Yeah. Anytime... What did he say? That he has a motorcycle. - Everyone knows that. - Sure. You've been here five years... ...and you've made no progress. If anything you've gotten worse. You have to interact with people. Do you understand me? Easy. Calm down. Antonio, Pablo! Brigadier General, sir! Retired, Chino. I'm retired. Hi, Chino, baby. What's up, darling? How's it going? I'm dying here. Got anything for me? Anything? Is the coast clear? Here, for you. Thank God. I had nothing left. - Wait here. - Take your time. - I tripped. - No need to rush. Chino! Now that's a pretty sight. Son of a... - How are you? - Fine. Did you get it? - I sure did. - Come on. Slow down. Don't make me beg for it, baby. I knew I could count on you. Chino, go for a walk or something. Don't be jealous now. Chino... Chino! - Okay, I'm off. - Leaving already? - Yeah. See you. - Take care. You, too. Bye. - Has he called? - Yes. He's coming on Thursday. I don't know. I'm not sure yet. Let's see how much he offers. We've already decided. Even if he offers a bit less. Where will we go? To Seville... ...like Alejandro. Or to Madrid. We're fine right here. No, we aren't, Jose. We're not fine here. He'll kill himself some day. He'll kill me first. - Do you like him? - Yes, I do. He's handsome. Yes, he is. And he has a motorcycle. Hey... What if he kisses you? Then I'll kiss him back. What if he touches you? I'll touch him back. What if he loves you? I'll love him back. I know what you all think. My own mother, rest her soul... ...said it before our wedding: "Son, she's too much woman for you." I don't know, Raul. Yes, you do, Jose. But you're a good friend, so you don't tell me. Thanks, Clara. She'll be the end of me, I swear it. And then what? Raul. Serve me another. - Beer or tickles? - Stop it, Carlitos. Not now. - Beer or tickles? - Get the hell away from me. Beer or tick... Does it still hurt? Serve him one. - When's your debut? - Autumn at the latest. Did you hear on the radio? Jeronimo Fuentes died in jail yesterday. That son of a bitch lived too long! - Have you heard? - Heard what? Jeronimo died in jail yesterday. He went mad. That's what I heard. It's over. Not yet, Jose. Not yet. With Jeronimo dead... I wish. But the others are alive, and they're just as bad. The same rotten blood runs through their veins. They'll always remember their mother. They can all go straight to hell. They had their trial! They could care less about justice, the law or God himself. They think we're guilty. Guilty? Those bastards killed my brother. They should all burn in hell. - Jose, the girls... - The girls are asleep. Small villages never forget. Cities do... ...because the old is replaced with the new. But here... ...everything stays the same. Things never grow easily, and they never really die. Leave me alone, I need to pee! Are you two ready? You always have to go first. You're such a pain! He's with you now, Mother. Poor man. So much bad blood in this damn village! It'll kill us all. Not much selection. We're out of season. No one knits in summer. This one's okay. Isa, do you like red? - Yes. - Let's see. It suits you. I can't believe they had the nerve to bury him here. What a situation, Carmen. Winter sweaters are made in summer. Look, all that matters... ...is that he's in hell with his crazy mother. And he's not coming back. - From where? - None of your business. Be more careful what you say. They're here. They are early. Who? Show-offs. That Paco Fernandez... ...was a total bum, and now look at him. Showing off. I wouldn't want to know where his money came from. What are you going to do? Keep it. Jeronimo won't be needing it. You can have mine. Throw out that piece of junk of yours. Just like back in the army.

Forever's a long time. Forever is now. Forever... The idiot? Idiot... He's not as dumb as you think. He was there the day of the fire. - He saw everything. - What did he see? - You really want to know? - Of course. I can take you to see him. - You think he'll talk to me? - Yes. He will if I ask him to. Carlitos is a hash fiend. - So it's true you deal? - Just to pay for my degree. Degree in what? I don't know, in whatever. Listen, Isabel. Why are you so obsessed with this? Why dig up all this old crap? That's my business. No, now it's mine as well. I don't like secrets. What does she want? I told you. Tell her about the fire. No, no. Not the fire. What for? I want to know what happened. No. You don't want to know. Come on, a deal's a deal. - She won't like it. - I told her that already. Tell me, girl. You know my parents are... ...my father and his sister. That means you know my mother is also my aunt. And that means I only have one grandmother. You're probably thinking: "What the hell can the idiot know?" That's normal. But I saw everything. The whole town saw it, but they all went mute at the trial. "Signs of criminal behavior," said the judge. They found a can of gasoline inside the house! But they couldn't prove anything without witnesses. Mother's burning! Mother's burning! I saw what I saw. They were all in on it. The only way to make a man talk... ...is to wire a car battery to his balls. But when a whole town goes silent... Did I mention my mother is my aunt? What a fucking drag. But it's a fact. I've got to live with it. Come on, get to the point. The night before the fire... When it was getting late... I saw your father at the gas station... ...filling a can with gas. So? What do you mean, "so"? I might be the village idiot, but I ain't stupid. Is that all? My father has a generator at the store. The lights are always going out. He fills those cans once a week. What else? Did you see him go in the house? I told you you wouldn't like it. Maybe it was your father, maybe it wasn't. Yes, but no. No, but yes. Maybe it was you. I told you she wouldn't like it. Shit, Carlitos. Isabel. Come on, relax. Crazy lady! Crazy lady! Crazy lady, crazy lady! Scram. What do you want? I've finished. Mom said to help her when I finished. Fine, go ahead. Father. What the hell is it? Nothing. Barley. How much? 800 kilos... 700 kilos of oats... - 1,500 of sunflower... - Is that all? - Yeah, that's all we had. - Who'd you sell to? Agustino from the co-op. 250 of corn... - And 600 of lupins. - How much? Six hundred. Here it comes... What? - What's coming? - The noise, Angela. The noise. They're driving us mad! It has to stop. - It'll stop. - Stop? This is never going to stop! - Antonio, do something. - What? - Antonio! - What? - This noise is going to kill us! - What should I do? Antonio! Mother's burning! Don't like wearing a helmet, eh? - No, I've got a helmet. - Sure you do. - Where's that? - At home. Touch me again. Go ahead, try it. Now it's my turn. You think we're fucking idiots? Is that it? No, sir. We've been watching you since last year, Chino. We know your kind. You're heading for trouble. - I don't know what you mean. - You don't? - No idea? - None. So the hash getting smoked in town... ...must have walked in here by itself. Chino, I'm telling you this for your own good. You're going down. You're in for some real shit. We're nice people.

Give your head a rest. I have a perfect plan. A couple good shotguns will do the trick. What about Emilio? Emilio's with me... ...everywhere I go. - How much is that one? - That's gold. I know it's gold. I asked how much. 35 thousand pesetas. - I have some other stuff... - No. I want that one. What's going on? I'm leaving. What do you mean? Where? I don't know.

Then however you say it. It doesn't matter. Look. The first time I saw your father... I got a lump right here in my throat... ...and during his military service... ...my whole chest caved in. But he came back. This one isn't coming back. How do you know? Why would he? There's nothing here. Come on, Isa. Cheer up. Things change, you know. You'll see. - Shall I heat some milk? - No, I'll do it. And straight to bed. Stop, stop. Hold still, Irene. If you don't hold still I can't do this. Mom, you're hurting me!
