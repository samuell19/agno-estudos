Rocko! Hey, come on, little guy! I'm a nice vet! So then, do you think today will be the day? Well, there's no way to predict a match with any degree of certainty, Mrs. Gilbert, but the day will come, I promise you that. All right, well, let's meet these new candidates. Well, you're the candidate, Mrs. Gilbert. - The dogs need to meet you. - Of course. Rocko! Hey, you, stop! Hey, Rocko! 'Scuse me. Fugitive on the loose... yea high, responds to the name of Rocko, apparently. Carly? Dan, hi. - I didn't know you were in town. - Yeah... last week. I'm taking over my grandpa's clinic. Your sister roped me in, said you guys needed some help, but, seems I've lost my first patient already. Not yet, apparently. Excuse me. Sorry! Rocko? Friend? Used to be. Are you ready for your interview? Yeah. Hey there, little guy. You'll get used to it. They're clever... especially this little guy. Thanks, Michelle. Man, you sure do run fast for having such short little legs. Okay, come on. Let's see why you're so upset. Oh, well, that's why he's so sensitive. Poor little guy's got an ear infection, but I am going to fix that right up. Your grandpa must be so happy that you're back. He is... so much so, that he wants me to live in his house permanently. He has no idea why I would want to get my own place. That's sweet. He's probably just lonely. Yeah. You know, I keep trying to convince him to adopt one of these dogs. Oh, well, you should set him up with my brother. After all, he is Dan the Dog Man. Dan... the Dog Man? Everyone's favorite matchmaker, the Canine Connector. Just wait. Yeah, no, I already ran into him... literally. - That was fast. - Yeah. Hey, how come you didn't tell him I was the new volunteer veterinarian? I just, you know, wanted it to be a surprise. - Why? - I don't know. Michelle... that was high school. All right, let's listen to the old ticker. Come here. I mean, this is seriously probably the nicest shelter I've ever been in. - How do you afford this? - We have a secret weapon. A secret weapon? You're going to love this. We have a genuine TV star that does a weekly segment on the news, brings in a lot of donations. Oh, my goodness. She is just the most adorable thing I have ever seen? Meet Cujo. Oh, no, I don't believe that. That couldn't possibly be true. Her real name is Beasley, and even Dan can't find a match for her. Let's go. Okay... - It's about to start. - It's about to start? What is all this? Welcome to "Friday's Forever Friend" weekly segment. Your secret weapon? Just wait... We're live in 30 seconds! Where's our star? - I thought Dan was the... - Yeah, he is. It's just... she doesn't know it yet. She? Right here! Makeup has to be right, people. Oh, come on. Kristi Waters? The Queen of Mean? I told you you'd love it. Ten seconds... She was always posing for a camera, even when there wasn't one. It gets even better. Hi, everyone, it's the end of the week, and that means it's time to meet "Friday's Forever Friend". I'm here as always with Dan "the Dog Man" Landis, the Canine Connector, at the Forever Friends Shelter where it's time to find the perfect match for you! So, Dan, just who is this adorable little girl we get to meet today? Well, Kristi, I'll agree that this puppy is very cute, but I've got to tell you, this girl is a guy, and his name is Bob. Bob? Who names a puppy "Bob"? Actually, my sister, Michelle, and she named Bob's brother "Stan," so... I think they might grow up to be accountants. Oh, my... - Here, you want to hold him? - Of course... Bob, you are the most gorgeous widdle guy ever! Bob's here looking for someone who likes to play and is good at throwing sticks. If you're lucky enough to have Bob pick you, then Bob's adoption will be easy and affordable. And that's why we love to show all the folks at home... "Friday's Forever Friend". I'll be back next week with Dan the Dog Man to introduce you to another lovable pooch looking for a forever home. For Channel 7 News, I'm Kristi Waters, saying, "Make man's best friend your best friend". And clear! - Can somebody take this, please? - Here, I got him. I got him. Wait... she hates dogs? Yeah... it gets better. I wish you wouldn't make me hold them like that. How many times do I have to tell you? Sorry, but it works. You're lucky you're so dang cute. - What? - Yep. Hey, Carly. I'll take him. Carly Monroe. You're... exactly the same. So are you. - I'll take that as a compliment. - So will I. This is Kristi Waters! Seriously? Yes. Yes, of course. Absolutely. I'll be there. Thank you so much! Bye-bye! - I'm going to New York! - You got the job? Yes! I can't believe it! It's actually happening! My head is spinning! They want me! Welcome to the Kristi Show. Exactly! Well, not right away. I'll be a field reporter to start, but not for long. New York City! - Well, congratulations. - Thank you! Come on, Dan the Dog Man, we are going out to celebrate. Should I tell her the doggy made a messy on her shirt. No. Oh, boy. - Hey, Grandpa. - Carly! - I think I burned dinner. - I love burnt. Yeah, well, this is beyond burnt. - Will you settle for a salad? - Yeah. Good idea. Great. - How'd it go at the shelter? - Wonderful. It was really great seeing Michelle again, and I've missed her. You know, I saw Dan's segment. He's good, isn't he? It's fun. Yep. And... And what? How was it seeing him after all these years? - Fine. - Fine? Grandpa... All right, none of my business. Just happy you're back. Well, I'm really happy to be back, too. Maybe you can convince Mom to move home, too. Your mom loves the sun. She's a snowbird forever. Yeah, you're probably right. All right. What is it? Nothing! I'm fine. Okay, you know, actually, I'm going to run upstairs and change really quick. I'll be right back. You know, you don't have to find your own place. You can stay here. - Yeah. I know. - Okay. "You haven't changed a bit, Carly Monroe". Thanks. So, Dan and Kristi Waters. How does that even happen? There must have been some sort of tear in the time-space continuum. Clearly. I mean, they don't even have anything in common. She's still just as pretentious as she was in high school, and the fact that she hates dogs... how is that even acceptable to him? I mean, I just... I don't... what? You're still crushing on my brother, aren't you? I am not crushing on him. Your face just turned two shades of pink. I don't do pink. Really? - One shade. - At least. Well, it's not... it's not like I don't care about his well-being. Well, the way you looked at him yesterday, you know, had nothing to do with his well-being. And the way he looks at Kristi Waters had nothing to do with mine... the way all guys look at Kristi. - That hair, those teeth... - That beautiful face? So symmetrical. Doesn't matter. She's moving to a distant galaxy far, far away, and long-distance relationships in distant galaxies never work. You and Dan, of all people, should know that. - Your timing is perfect. - My timing? Michelle, I did not move back here to be with Dan. We're not in high school anymore. Think we're, like, all still in high school. Doesn't matter. You can deny it all you want, but there is a reason why you haven't fallen in love, gotten married, had kids, all of that. Why? Why? No, it's not like that. No, Dan and I, we had something great, and then we went off to college... life happened... You know what I think it is? I think it's just that I don't want to settle for anything less than how I felt for him, and that's... that's it. That's all. That's end of story. But all stories that are good deserve a sequel. Michelle! I am happy with my life. Do not meddle. No, I'm not. I'm not meddling. You... you are a meddler. You always meddle. I've got to go. Do you want to come over tonight, for dinner? Okay, sure. Yeah? Can cook up a little love pasta. - Would you stop! - All right, I'm going. Hey. Great. I see you dressed up for the occasion. What occasion? Come in. I'm not up to something. Nothing's going on. So I thought we would do my famous spinach pasta. - Famous where? - Everywhere. Hey, kid. - Hi there, kid! Hey. - Hey. Hi! Using your old nicknames, I see. Yeah, no... I just invited Dan because I figured you two have barely had a chance to catch up. Sorry, I didn't want to crash the party. Oh, no. No, I'm really happy to see you. I just... I would've dressed up a bit for the occasion. I'll be right back. You two, do your thing. - So... - So... So... are you here for good, or...? Yeah, yeah, that's the plan... you know, assuming my grandfather actually ever retires. Carly the veterinarian. Who would have thought? Dan the Dog Man. Who would have thought? - Well, you started it. - Me? Yeah, when we were kids, remember? That puppy that got swept into the creek behind your house? Yeah. You know, the poor thing would've drowned if you hadn't jumped in. You mean, if you hadn't pushed me in. You did! Well, I, you know... at least you saved the dog. Yeah. - Been saving them ever since. - Yeah, every Friday. The Friday thing, that's kind of silly, isn't it? No! Hey, it works... and truth is, I kind of hate being on television. Really? Well, I thought it was great, you know. You're... a natural... like your girlfriend. - Yeah, Kristi. - Yeah. Well, yeah, she lives for it. She always has lived for it, I guess... But you know what? She helps raise a lot of money, so... Well, that's really considerate of her, since she seems to hate dogs. - Hate's a pretty strong word. - Not when it comes to Kristi. You haven't changed a bit. I'd take that as a compliment, if I were you. - Well, it was meant as one. - I know. - Four. - Four what? - Four plates. - Why four? Hello? - You didn't. - She wanted to come. Dan! Kristi! Looking great. Thanks for coming. Hello, everyone. So sweet of you to do this. - I mean, it's just dinner. - No, it's not. I mean, we could have gone to a nice restaurant or something, but this is very... thoughtful... and honestly, unexpected. I didn't think you'd approve... not that Dan needs your approval. Am I missing something? - You haven't even told her? - Told me what? Well, first, I'm needed in New York sooner than expected. We're moving at the end of the month. You mean you're moving at the end of the month. No... we. Us, together... but that's not the big news. The big news is... we're getting married! Married? I haven't had a chance to tell you yet. - We just decided this morning. - Decided? Yeah. You're getting married? Yeah! It's exciting, huh? Married! - You can't move to New York. - Of course he can. I mean... what about the shelter? We'll figure something out. Dan has bigger aspirations than running a dog shelter. So do I. I was supposed to go back to cosmetology school. That was our agreement. Well, our agreement was that if I got the network job and moved to New York, we'd get married. How romantic. Hey, look, we can talk about this tomorrow. You can't leave. Hey... it's going to be all right, okay? So, what's for dinner? I'm starved. Bon appetit. He cannot leave. - He's going to marry her? - This cannot happen. She is so wrong for him. He's going to be stuck with her for the rest of his life. You have to change his mind. Come on, Michelle! You can't just change someone's mind about these things. Do you want him to marry her? Not exactly. Do you want this shelter to be shut down? No, of course not. - Do you trust me? - Of course not. We have 30 days to turn this disaster around. - And the meddling begins. - No... the countdown begins. It's on. Well, your duck will be swimming again, in no time, Mrs. Dunlap. Thank you. You're very sweet. Well, that's because she takes after me. Your granddaughter has a nice disposition. I don't know where she got that from. Very funny. Nonetheless, you're going to be in good hands when I retire. You're never going to retire, Isaac. You know that. - You both take care, now. - You too. Come on... She's right, you know... this was your calling. I know that look. What is it? I'm fine. I heard that Dan was leaving. Getting married, is he? Word travels fast, huh? I don't think Dan and New York are a very good match, though, do you? It's not really my business. Well, I mean, I'm worried about the shelter. You know, he does great work there, and there's a lot of dogs that wouldn't have homes if it wasn't for him. I hope he realizes that. Hate to see him make a mistake. What is it? Michelle wants me to come in. One of the dogs is having an emergency, so I'll see you later. You want me to go? No, it's okay. I got it. Okay. I've already been looking at places on the Upper East Side. The whole wedding thing is another issue. It's going to be everything I can do to keep my mother from taking over. - You know how she is. - I know. Doesn't matter. We will decide what we want. I just cannot believe this is really happening, that we're actually going to be living in New York! What am I going to be doing there? We'll find something for you, sweetie. Look, a whole new world of opportunities is going to open up... for both of us. It's a big change, Kristi, and Michelle, she's not happy. It's putting her under a lot of pressure, too. Well, Michelle doesn't control your life. What? It's nothing. Look, I want you to be excited about this. I am excited, but I've got a lot of responsibilities here. And you'll get it all figured out like you always do. You have always been so supportive, and I want you with me. We're a team. I love you. What now? It's Michelle. Something's wrong with one of the dogs. Well, can't she handle it? I mean, she might as well get used to handling things, right? - It's Beasley. - That nasty thing? She's not nasty, and I'm the only one that she trusts. It's just a dog. I'll see you tomorrow. Poor thing. - What's wrong with her? - It was the darndest thing. I heard whimpering, and then I went to check in on her, and she wasn't breathing. Then... like a miracle! Just popped right back to normal before Carly got here. - A miracle, huh? - Yeah, she seems fine to me. I would check her, just to be sure. Take your time. I know how much Beasley means to you. Sorry, hope I didn't panic you. Yeah. She wasn't breathing, right? Like I said, it was the darndest thing. Yeah, you said that. What were you doing here at this hour anyway? Well, I have to take over the shelter, so I have a lot of work to do. Right, right. I'm going to let you two... and... toodles! Well, it's a good thing she was here, huh? - Yeah, a miracle. - Yeah. - Speaking of which... - What? You seem to be the only other person Beasley's comfortable with. Oh, really? What's her history? We don't know. I found her in a ditch. I guess that's why she trusts me so much. - Yep, she definitely likes you. - Yeah? Yeah. Wait... She's wondering if she can take you for a walk. - Wait, take me for a walk? - Yeah. Well, yes, of course. I would love that. - Would you like to join us? - I'll have to ask. Is that okay, Beasley? I think that's a yes. - Definitely a yes. - Yeah. - Okay. - Come on, you. So, Dan the Dog Man, Mr. Expert Matchmaker... Come on, Beasley's clearly chosen who she wants to be with. Why haven't you adopted her? It's complicated. You do know "It's complicated" is a euphemism for "It shouldn't have to be this complicated," right? Hey, are you hungry? These are so good. Always hungry. Can we get two strawberry and chocolate crepes, please? Want some crepes, Beas, huh? Yup, you definitely are the only other person besides me that she's comfortable with. Well, not at first, but now we get along, don't we, Beas? I think it's 'cause you love dogs so much. Yeah, well, you and I have that in common. Yeah, Kristi and I don't. Thank you. Yeah, but, I mean... why is that? Does she have some kind of crazy allergy or what? No, she just doesn't like dogs. Wait, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to comprehend. She doesn't like dogs? At all? Apparently, when she was a little girl, she got bit, but... you know, I just think that's an excuse. You know what I wonder sometimes? Whether she just doesn't like that I give more attention to the dogs than her. What? She's jealous of the rescue animals? It's just a theory. I mean, are you okay with that? I mean, never being able to have a dog? It's a relationship, right? It's about compromise. No... compromise is about meeting in the middle. I'm seeing about 90-10 here, Dan. Sorry, she's your fiancée. Do I detect a little bit of sarcasm, Carly Monroe? I wasn't going for a little. I was right. You haven't changed a bit. Well... how else are you going to know that I... that I'm sincere? So... how'd you end up with Kristi Waters? I mean, the world's biggest dog lover, and the world's biggest dog hater? Well, yeah... she didn't exactly spell it out when we first started dating. - So she lied to you. - No, she didn't exactly lie to me. Come on! It's a classic bait and switch. Sorry. Can't help it. Hey... don't be sorry, all right? I really appreciate that you're honest with me... but if you really want to know the truth, the "Friday Friends" thing, that was all Kristi's idea. She made it happen, I was allowed to do what I love. It saved the shelter, and a lot of animals, so, you know, I owe her for that. Don't you mean you love her for that? Come on, Dan, we owe bankers and lawyers, not fiancées. You just don't know her the way that I know her. No... but I do know you. Come on, I'm just looking out for you, kid. Thanks, kid. You know, I might take Beasley home with me tonight. It really helps to keep her calm, and I just live around the corner. Yeah... well, I've got to go back to the shelter and grab a few things, but I'll close up for you. - Thanks. - Yeah. Beasley, come on. Hey... - Thank Beasley for the walk. - I will. 'Kay. - Hey, Carly? - Yeah? Thank you for the walk. You're welcome. Come on. - Hello. Hey there. - I know what we need to do. - Should I be nervous? - Well... What's your next brilliant plan? - You. - Me? It's pretty obvious, the way Dan looked at you last night. He lit up like a firefly, not to mention you absolutely glow around him. I don't glow. The point is, he's crushing on you, too. Please. - He just doesn't know it yet. - No, come on! That ship has sailed with the wind at Kristi's back, all right? Dan's never going to see me the way that he sees Kristi, and I mean that literally. - So you agree. - Agree to what? - You need a tune-up. - What am I, a car? A makeover. You know how men are. They're... visual. You just have to bait the hook a little. Bait the hook? If you want him back, you have to wow him. You're insane. Insanity is the mother of invention. Necessity is the mother of invention. Exactly! Listen, if Dan's not going to be with Kristi, then he needs to figure that out on his own, okay? Not because of your... plotting. - Well, some things take plotting. - No, no, no. I am not going to be the bait to your scheming hook. - Then he's going be gone. - Well, then he was meant to go. No, this is not the time for your "It's the way of the universe" reasoning. You know, desperate times call for desperate... Three words for you. No. Way. Ah-ha. That's four words. Anyways, you have to trust me on this. I don't trust you on anything. Listen, I have a ton of patients in the morning, so I'm going to need you to go, all right? I just got here. I think you need to go find somewhere else to meddle. I don't meddle. I don't think you know what that word means. I've never meddled before. I'm really sorry I haven't been able to make a decision yet, Dan. Well, you don't choose the dog, Mrs. Gilbert... The dog chooses me. I know that... but it still has to be mutual, and I just haven't felt that connection. So, are you getting tired of setting up all of my interviews? Hey... Not at all, okay? When you know, you'll know, and so will he or she. It's... it's a lot like falling in love. You can't control it. It controls you. Are you an expert at falling in love? Far from it. Well, is anyone? Actually, yes, my husband was, and I was very lucky in that way. I miss him, and I guess that's why I'm looking for a friend. Well... then let's make sure we find you the right match, shall we? Yeah. Michelle? The countdown is on. You won't regret this. That is the beginning of every regret, you know. Pish posh. Hi, Dr. Monroe. Hey, Michelle. What are you two up to? Saving the world one makeover at a time. I'll see you at the shelter later. - I'm going to get a dog. - Great! Okay, just so you know, I still think this is crazy. I'm only doing this for you. I know, I know. We just have to change something. - Some... things. - Things... Everything... the glasses, the hair... you wear no make-up... Please, be honest. You said it yourself. Dan still considers you his high-school sweetheart. I mean, this is Kristi Waters we're dealing with, so if you want him to see you as something else, you have to become something else. What? When's the last time you went shopping, senior year of high school? Come on, Michelle. You know I don't care about stuff like that. Well, it's not like... come on, I like my clothes! Well, I got my license in that. No. No, I got my braces off in that! It was a really big day. It's cute. No, no! Look, I can't afford a whole new wardrobe, okay? - I have student loans to pay off. - And I have a credit card. Volume. No. Let go of the hair. Let it down. We don't need that anymore. Yes! Yes, bigger! I am loving it! Too much? Maybe a little. - What about the glasses? - What? No! Michelle, I can't see without those! Well, what's important is that Dan sees. We want him to see everything. - Can you handle it? - I can try. You have a small male dog to deliver. Hey, Dan. Dr. Monroe! Right on time. You said you had someone in mind. Yes, sir, a new friend that just moved in. I was telling him about you. He'd like to meet. - Let's do it. - All right. Just back here. So, Prince here is interested in a new companion, and he'd like to take you for a walk, Dr. Monroe. Glad to hear it. - Thanks, Megan. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - You're welcome! All right, so just be yourself. Don't try to impress. Dogs see truth. I've been a vet for over 50 years, Dan. I think I taught you that. That's right, you did. Wait, whoa. I already had an appointment with Prince. Well, he's already requested a walk with me. You told me noon. I'm afraid I did, Mrs. Gilbert. I am so sorry for the mix-up. There're other dogs. Do you have any idea how long it has taken me to find a dog that I could act... Wait! Prince might have a solution. He'd like to take both of you for a walk... if that's okay? Well, I... I can live with that. I suppose. There's a nice little trail right around the corner. Well, I think Prince would like that. He does. - I'll take him first. - Really? All right, I suggest you two both be on your best behavior. Prince here is very particular and frowns on anything but happy thoughts. Understood? Understood. Thank you. Take some time, you know. Get to know each other. Carly? That's Carly, all right. - That can't be Carly. - I think it is. Indeed, it is. Those heels are taller than I am. - Hey! - Hey! - What's with the get-up? - Get-up? Nah, it's just... me being me. It's okay. I... I'm going to head inside and take care of the animals that I love. What's going on? She looks amazing, right? - You're doing so good. - Really? Just... Yeah, you look great. Fantastic. Just... He's coming. Act natural. It's just straight ahead. Yeah! I'm fine. Honestly. - Where are your glasses? - In my purse. Why? Because I got contacts, and they just... they're not going to arrive for a few more days, so... Well, shouldn't you just wear your glasses in the meantime? No! No, 'cause they're a different prescription, and it's a stronger one, and... well, and my glasses are in my purse, which is in my car, so... Why did she get all dressed up? If I have to answer that... You really don't get it, do you? Get what? It. "It"? To be young again. Not me. I like being old... except for my knee. I had to give up my golf. I'm past all that nonsense, you know... courtship, trying to impress someone... Well, good. Yeah. Okay... Okay... So... - Are you okay? - Yeah! Yeah. Never been better. So, who is our patient here, huh? Beasley. Hey! Hey, you recognize me? It's Carly! Maybe if you pulled your hair back, she could see your face better. Right... my hair ties are in my purse. And your purse is in your car. Right... Here. Okay... Rubber band. - I can... - I'll... Okay. All right. Thanks. You look... nice. I haven't seen you this dressed up since, prom? I just... you know, I thought I'd... switch things up a little. So... let's see here. Okay... let's see your pretty smile. Here we go. That's a happy dog. Hey. Hey... I got this. Yeah. That's good. You know, I used to bring my Charlie to you. You know, I thought you looked familiar. - Shepherd, right? - Yeah. - Beautiful animal. - Yeah. I met your wife once, and... what was her name? Claire. I'm a widower now. I'm sorry. It's all right. It's been a while... and your husband? He used to bring Charlie in to see me sometimes. Yeah, he's passed away as well. It's been a few years. Listen... I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot today. It's just that this is the first dog I've actually felt a connection with. I think it's your turn to take the reins. Well, let's both get to know him a little better, Come on, Prince. Come on, buddy. What was that? Totally my bad. I talked her into it... - just change things up a little. - Why? You know, I love you, but you really are clueless. Way to go, Carly Monroe. You just ruined any chance you had. - Dr. Monroe. - Hey, hello, Dan. Here to give Prince a walk again? - Yeah, if that's okay. - Yeah, of course. - Are you expecting someone? - No. - Who would I be expecting? - No one. Prince is in the back here. Have you... have you talked to Carly since the whole... you know...? No, no. I tried calling her, but she hasn't called me back. Why? Well, if I have to answer that, then you don't get it, do you? - Get what? - It. - "It"? - That's what I said. Look, I think Carly's trying to impress you. Impress me? Why? You're asking the wrong person. You might want to go see her. All right. Come on, Prince. I forgot. Mrs. Gilbert is walking Prince today. Would it be all right if you shared him again? - Yeah, sure. It's okay. - Seems only fair. Two days in a row, you two. Well, Prince's can't seem to quite make up his mind. Yeah, he's a little torn. And we don't want to put any pressure on him. There's no rush. That's very thoughtful. Shall we? Dr. Monroe. And you did not forget I was coming in. I have no idea what you're talking about, Mrs. Gilbert. Yes, you do. - Is she going to be okay? - Well, I think so. Let me ask you something, Emma. Does Sprinkles here have a sweet tooth? - She does like chocolate. - I bet she does, but I don't think chocolate likes her very much. How much chocolate did you give her exactly? Just a little. At first. You've got to think of Sprinkles kind of like your little sister. I mean, she can only eat what she's supposed to, okay? You wouldn't stuff your little sister full of chocolate now, would you? Maybe... Well, next time, how about you just share your chocolate with me instead? - Okay. - Okay. She's good to go. - Thank you, Doctor. - Sure. Let me know if she breaks into another stash. Will do. Goodbye! Thanks, Dr. Carly! Bye, Emma. - Hi. - Hey. Why, I hardly recognize you with your contacts in. Very funny. Peace offering. Come on, I'm the one who should be offering peace terms. - I'm so embarrassed. - Don't be embarrassed. We've all worn the wrong heels on the wrong occasion. Bag lunch, just like old times? I don't know. Is it peanut butter and jelly? Of course. - Okay, I accept your terms. - Excellent. Man, I don't think I've had a PB-and-J since high school. Last time for me was right here... with you. Yes! Nicely done. Hey, Monroe! Five bucks says you can't hit that shot. What? Come on! It's right there. I'm not that unathletic! - Okay... - Make it ten. - You're on. - Okay. I'm about to make ten dollars. No pressure. - I scored! - Lucky shot. - Come on. Pay up. - I forgot my wallet. You are such a liar. Don't be a squelch. Hello, Mr. Hamilton. Nice to meet you. Let's go, Lucky Shot. So, did I make a total fool of myself, or just... sort of? No, no, it was... it was total. Come on! But I know why you did it... I think... and I know that my sister put you up to it... playing matchmaker so maybe I wouldn't move? She didn't exactly have to twist my arm. - Why exactly did you do it? - It doesn't really matter. I just hate seeing you forced into a decision you don't want to make. And that's it? That's your only motive? I guess... I thought maybe, for a minute, that if I was as pretty as Kristi, then maybe you'd have second thoughts. It was stupid. Yeah, it was. Come on, you don't have to be that honest. No, I mean, that you think that that's all I care about, is how Kristi looks, her job, her fame... and I'll let you in on a little secret. You don't need all those things to be prettier than Kristi. Is this the part where you pass me a note, and you ask me to be your girlfriend, and tell me to circle yes or no? Hey, I'm being serious. - Well then, don't tease me. - I'm not. Carly, you are beautiful... inside and out. Glasses or no glasses. The truth is, seeing you again, it just brought me right back to us. Listen, I just, I got caught up in the moment, and it was silly, and I'm over it. - Over it? - Over it. Man, it really makes me wish I never went away to college. Come on. Don't do that. Don't make regrets out of the choices you made. What, you don't think it was a mistake that we both left? No... because if it was a mistake, then it invalidates every choice we've ever made. I mean... did I think about you? Yes. Did I sometimes wonder what might have been? Yes... but you're Dan the Dog Man. Your path took you here, and... the world's a better place because of it... and I followed my dreams, and now I'm a veterinarian, and the world's a better place because of that, too. Everything happens the way it's supposed to, so no regrets. - You still believe in all that? - Yep. All of it. But you think I'm making a mistake now, don't you? No, you're making a choice, Dan. It's only a mistake if it's not your own. Hey, Michelle. - Yeah, hang on. - Shoot, what time is it? Yeah, no, be right there! Come on! Do you have the time? - I've been calling and calling! - Sorry, my phone died. - Where were you? - Having lunch. - With her? It's 4:00, Dan. - I know. I lost track of time. Listen, it was my fault. I was enjoying his company. I'm sure you were, but while you two were out gallivanting, no one here can make a decision! They don't know what dog you want to feature. We just didn't know which dog was ready to be matched yet. We have no dog for the segment, and we go on air in three minutes! - Speckles! - Okay, Speckles. No, Sushi! Get Sushi. - I'll get him. - Go! Go! - Catching up on old times? - Yeah. I don't like the way she speaks to me... or looks at me. She probably feels the same way. So it's my fault? One minute. We need a dog now! Come on, Prince. There. That one. No, that one's not up for adoption. Excuse me... We are going to need to borrow this dog. - For what? - "Friday's Friend" Segment. Sort of have an emergency situation. Thirty seconds. No, no, no. This is... this is ours. You're going to have to find another dog. - You'll find another dog. - No. We are about to go live! Prince already made his decision. - Which one of us did he pick? - Seriously! I think you both know the answer to that. Dan! You are a very rude young lady. Excuse me? I got him! I got him. Carly to the rescue. I hope so. All right, and in three... two... For Channel 7 News, I'm Kristi Waters with Dan the Dog Man, saying, "Make man's best friend your best friend". And clear! - Great job. - Beautifully done. Thank you, and my apologies. I just don't think some of you realize the pressure of performing on live TV. Can I get some water, please? So, how's the extended interview process going, Prince? That's what my grandpa tells me, too. - So, you must be Mrs. Gilbert. - I am. - It's really nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. And thank you, Dan. It wouldn't be fair if someone else got their hopes up for this one. Well, I know a good match when I see one. Excuse me, everyone! I have an announcement to make... a surprise for the man I love, Dan the Dog Man. Here we go... I know I have been totally wrapped up in my new job, and I'm sorry for that... but... yesterday, I called the network and told them I needed a big favor, and I am proud to announce that you, Dan Landis, will be the New York Regional Executive Director for... the National Dog Rescue Association! - What? - Yes! Right in the heart of New York. Everything you're doing here, but on an entirely different level. - Are you serious? - Of course I'm serious. I don't know what to say. - How about thank you? - Thank you! - I knew you'd be happy. - Yeah! Yeah, definitely. I'm going to go get out of this make-up. Looks like another celebration is in order. Okay. I honestly can say I didn't see that coming. Well, those are the best kind of surprises, huh? Yeah. Congratulations. You deserve it. - Thanks. - Sure. Come on, Prince. Well, I guess that's that, then. I've got to give her credit. Her timing is impeccable. I know I go on and on about the shelter, but... he's my brother, and I kind of like having him there. - I got used to it. - So you're just giving up? Well, I mean, Dan just got his dream job. Our little plan backfired. Wave the white flag. I'm not. - I have an idea. - Talk to me. The only problem is, do I still have feelings for Dan, or is it simply a transference of memories? Are you deep in thought again? You have to understand something, Michelle. We don't remember past relationships based on fact. We remember them based on feelings, you know? We just grasp onto something that can never be recreated, and by romanticizing certain experiences, we simply make our present fulfillment of life seem worse than it actually is! Come again? I also have to make sure that I'm doing the right thing. All right, fine. We have less than a week. What's your plan? Okay, so Dan's main concern about leaving is the welfare of the dogs, right? Right, seems to be the case. So what if we have an adoption fair! I mean, forget about adopting one dog. What if we find homes for all of the them before Dan leaves? That's great for the dogs. But... what about you and Dan and keeping him here? I mean, that's just going to make him happy that he's leaving. Well, not necessarily. I mean, maybe it'll make him realize what wonderful work he's doing here, and, you know, what he'd be walking away from, and besides, it'll give us a chance to spend some more time together. I could really need some more time. To convince Dan... or you? Both. I see. There we go. Just keep an eye on him. He'll be okay. Come on, buddy. Here we go. - You didn't steal him, did you? - Yeah, I stole him. Actually, I thought maybe you might like to take him for a walk on your own property, give him a chance to see if he likes it here or not before he makes his decision. That's a good idea. I'll be right with you. - You think Prince would like it here? - I think he'd love it. You know, if I did adopt him, you could come and visit him anytime. Well, I mean, we've got to do what's right for the dog. You know, your flowers are so beautiful. Did you plant all these yourself? It's become somewhat of a hobby. Well, if you decide to retire, you're going to need a hobby. Not if. Carly's more than capable. My patients will be in good hands. You know, she is so lovely, and it's just a shame that Dan's moving away, because the two of them are in love. They seem to be the only two that don't know it. I think they do. They just don't know how to say it. Well, I hope they figure it out. Shame if they don't. I think it's perfect. Do you think we can get it organized in a week? - We can do it. - Yeah, we can do it. We'll just, you know, pass out some flyers, hang up some posters, and, you know, we'll make it an event. - Where are we going to hold it? - Well, it shouldn't be here. It should be some place people would normally take their dogs, like... how about Long Lake Park? You know, we could set up a walking area, do a meet and greet, have some fun... we could do an interview room! I love it. - Great! - Great! And I thought a banner than says, "Countdown to Love", just to remind people that dogs are more than just pets. Hey, Beas! You doing okay, huh? Countdown to Love? Yeah, let's just call it what it is. Okay, yeah. Let's do it. Hey... I just really want you to know, I really appreciate everything you're doing, and... Oh, shoot. Sorry. Hey, what's up? Because if I'm going to work for them, then I should at least introduce myself. Hey, Beasley, come here. Okay, yeah. Sure. See you soon. I'm going to have to catch up with you. I've got to go help Kristi pack. Yeah, well, I've got to give Beasley another checkup anyway. It is just so amazing how she has taken to you. Yeah, she just needed a little more time. Isn't it amazing how much she loves dogs? I mean, she's a real dog person. What? I'm just saying. Great, we'll see you there. Hey! So I've got all the shelter volunteers on board with helping with the event. Local media's going to promote it, and they are eating up the "Countdown to Love" idea. That's great. What next? Banners, so I'm going to head to the local print shop. And tomorrow, we have to work on getting all these critters cleaned up, so can you get some supplies for that? I'm already on it. Great, I'll... I'll see you tomorrow. Forever Friends Rescue Shelter, Michelle speaking. Carly! - Hi... - Mrs. Gilbert. Rita came over to, discuss Prince. Rita. We were talking. We were just... talking about... - Discussing Prince. - Clearly. Come sit down. Actually, we made a decision about Prince. And who gets to adopt him. Dan seems to think he likes both of us. Equally. I see. And after careful consideration, we decided that we would... We'd both actually like to spend a lot more time with him... actually, as much time as possible. Okay. And the only logical way to do that is if we both adopt him. Very logical. Yeah... which means we would be spending a lot of time together. Well... I think that's great. - You do? - Really? Yeah. Of course I do. I... you know, you both deserve a... a friend. Well, it's mostly about Prince. Definitely, and it's very... noble. Oh, by the way, you know, I saw a cute little apartment for rent just down the street. Grandpa! Okay, I'll look into it. Okay... I... you don't think this is moving a little fast, do you? For Prince? Well, at our age, we have to move fast. Well... have a good night. So you know, I just... I'm so close with my grandfather, and I just thought that it made sense for me to want to become a veterinarian, you know? Yeah? This one's so cute. I know! She's been so good today, too. So much hair, so little time. We've got to get them clean. Nobody likes a smelly dog. - Do they? - No. You know, I was thinking. About Beasley here... and... you know that I'm a good matchmaker. Yeah, the best. A legend. What do they call you in these parts, "The Canine Connector"? Well, that's one of them. Anyhow, I was thinking... That I should adopt Beasley. Well, actually, that Beasley should adopt you, but yeah. Right. You're the only other person that she trusts, and I'm not holding onto a lot of hope that that's going to change after the adoption fair. I'm just really worried about what's going to happen to her after I leave. I mean, come on, Beasley's great, but she belongs with you. Yeah... that's non-negotiable. It's pretty amazing to me how you can be so good at matching dogs to people, and even people to other people. What do you mean? My grandfather hasn't been this happy in years. Very cleverly done, by the way. - It was a lay-up. - Yeah, but still, you did that. I mean, you do it every day, but somehow, you really have no talent for matching yourself to others, do you? You know... every discussion we have is about my choices and my decisions. What about you? Why can't you tell me how you really feel? Okay. Don't go to New York. - That's... that's how I feel. - No, that's what you think. Why don't you want me to go to New York? Come on... Because... Dan... Her timing is impeccable. So is yours. Figures you two would be in a dog-friendly cafe. What, you're having another stroll down memory lane? We were just discussing my future in New York, and how much I'm going to miss Beasley. Beasley? Yeah. Beasley. Well, thanks to me, Beasley will more than likely have a new home by tomorrow. I spoke with my station manager. They've agreed to do live updates from the adoption fair throughout the day, sort of an extension of the "Friday Friends" segment. There won't be a single dog left with that kind of exposure. And then there will be nothing holding Dan back. Exactly. You know, Kristi, you have an uncanny ability of doing other people favors that somehow manage to serve you more than anyone. Thank you. Dan? We're having dinner with my parents, remember? Are you coming with me? Are you? Okay... And then you just said that to him, just like that? Then what happened? He seemed really upset. Really? And then what happened? Nothing. Queen Mean showed up just in time to bail him out. - We are so close. - No, it's over... I can't hear you! I'm not doing... Sorry, couldn't hear you. It was so loud. What were you saying? Go ahead. I'm not... - Come on. - Okay, all right. No sauce? If only we had another few days. He almost didn't get into her car. Then tell him again. Profess your love to him. - I can't do that. - Why not? Because you can't just convince someone to fall in love with you. You are so stubborn. You don't have to convince him. He loves you. - You know he does. - No. It's too late. - It's not too late. - Look, he made his choice. I saw that today, so... look, let's just do the adoption fair tomorrow, and then... we'll just get on with our lives. - Ice cream? - Ice cream always helps. Yeah. I have so many flavors right now... - Do you have chocolate? - Yeah, of course! Okay. Come on, Beasley. You two seem to be hitting it off quite nicely. Oh, Beasley. Yeah, though I'm pretty sure she has her heart set on someone else. - Yeah, I've been watching. - Watching? Well, not spying. I don't spy, I watch. I observe. I was a teacher. It taught me a lot about human nature. I used to see these kids. They would... well, they'd have crushes on each other, but they'd never say anything about it, and I think they were too embarrassed... but yet, they always seemed to find some reason to interact. Like walking the same dog, Mrs. Gilbert? Yeah. I think I've been playing along quite nicely, don't you? Yes. Very, very nicely. I mean, men are clueless sometimes. I mean that in the most loving way. It's really quite sweet, and then, of course, there's Dan. He's so proud of his matchmaking skills. I don't want him to be disappointed... but I did kind of make sure that I was at the shelter the second time your grandfather came to walk the dog. - Your grandpa's kind of hot. - Mrs. Gilbert! - No, seriously. He's hot. - Stop! You know, women don't pick up on things the way we do, Dan. That's why I had to play along, you know, and just act like I didn't know it was more than Prince she wanted to take a walk with. - So you're on to her? - Of course I am. She doesn't realize it, and don't tell her. I don't want to embarrass her. Dr. Monroe... who says an old dog can't learn new tricks? Who says I'm an old dog? Yeah, but it's so obvious how you two feel about each other. Just say it. Your grandfather's telling me everything I need to know without ever saying a word. Sometimes, you need to say words, Mrs. Gilbert, and sometimes, you need to hear them. I mean... this isn't a dress rehearsal. It's our life. Did you see that on a pillow, or a sign? A sign, actually. Look, the point is, the two of you didn't just find the perfect dog. You found each other. Seize the day, remember? I guess I should be taking my own advice. Hey, you said it, not me. You want me to tell her how I feel? Dr. Monroe... women, they want to hear what's in your heart. You don't want her to meet another dog, start taking him for a walk? No, I suppose not. - So, I think we're finished here. - Us too. Let's go find Prince and we'll take him for a walk. Great. Did you say I haven't told you how I felt? - Yeah. You? - Yeah. Think they'll clue in? Fingers crossed. - I'm so happy for them. - Me too. You know, it's funny. I... I know Mrs. Gilbert has more life experience than I do, but I think I was able to give her some really good advice. Yeah. Me too. - I hope they clue in. - Me too. You keep saying that. I've got to get back to the shelter, so... Yeah, I have some appointments. Here. Thank you again for all of this. Yeah, of course. Guess I'll see you tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. - Hey. - Hey. Well, I... think we're going to have a great turn out tomorrow. Yeah, you know, I didn't actually think we could pull this off. Yeah... So, you all packed up, ready to go? Look... I know you're upset that I'm going and I'm leaving you with the shelter, but... No, I'm not... anymore. I mean... I... I mean it. I just don't want you to be stressed out... anymore. You know, I just want you to know that the shelter's in good hands. I just hope that you are. I guess that's the million-dollar question, hey? Are you sure you don't know the answer to that? Maybe. Carly coming home brought back a lot of memories, a lot of feelings... good ones... and then suddenly, I have to move and give up the shelter that I worked so hard to build, make decisions on the rest of my life? I'm feeling torn... but I can't help but wonder if the feelings that I have for Carly are just a transference of how I used to feel? And maybe it's the same for her, and she just doesn't realize it yet. You both are seriously attached at the brain. Look, you know... you don't need any more advice, especially from me. I mean, you're my brother. I love you. No matter what you decide, I'm going to support you... but I will say this. Sometimes, it's not a decision. How so? Sometimes, the universe decides these things for us. Just hope that you'll be awake enough to get the clue. Brother. Daddy, can I take one home? Please! Why don't we go take a look at the one you want? We're going to run out of dogs before we run out of people. I know... except for Beasley. Keeps growling at everyone. Well, I thought Dan wanted you to adopt Beasley. Yeah, he does, but I just can't right now, you know? I don't know where I'm going to live, and besides... She'll just remind you of Dan. - Stupid, huh? - No. Come on, let's go see how the adoptions are doing. So remember, if you've ever thought about being adopted by a dog, today is your day. Come on down right now to Long Lake Park and check out all these canine cuties. And I'll be there to make sure they find their perfect match... you! 'Cause that's what Dan the Dog Man does! Come see him while you still can, because tomorrow, we'll be taking off for New York, New York! Keep watching. We'll be back with one last live update soon! And cut! We have officially been adopted! That's great! The both of you? Well... well, officially, it's in Rita's name, but I get visitation rights. It's joint custody. Great event, Carly. You should be proud of yourself. Thanks, Grandpa. We're going to dinner later at The Grillhouse. Why don't you join us? No, actually, I need to stay back and help Michelle clean up, but why don't you two... or three... enjoy yourselves. - See you at the house? - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye! Have fun! - How cute are they? - They're adorable. I'm so glad they finally figured it out. Hey! I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this is. Yeah, I didn't think this many people would turn out. One of the things I'm going to do when I get to New York is sponsor events like this throughout the country. I mean, people don't need to go to pet stores. There are so many shelters with animals just waiting for someone to give them a home. Yeah, I think it's a great idea. You know, Dan, actually, I'm pretty worried about Beasley, you know. She's been really agitated. She's snarling at everyone. Maybe we should keep her with one of us. Yeah. Hey, we want to get Beasley here. Come here, Beasley. Come here. Alrighty. See, she just needed some fresh air and sunshine, See? You're a good match. Yeah... Finally! It's about my job. I've been calling and calling, and they're only now just getting back to me. Yeah, go, go. Dan here. How's it going? Well, we continue to talk in metaphors. We don't have time for metaphors. Who's he talking to on the phone? - It's about his job. - Well, he doesn't look happy. Where is Dan? We are about to go live. He's over there. Uh-oh. What? Why "Uh-oh"? Be right back. Thank you. We're on the air in three minutes, babe. That was my new boss. Regional Executive Director? That job is filled, and it's not vacating any time soon. They want me on as a volunteer. Okay, I know how this sounds. I may have made a slight error in my choice of words. Choice of words? You said I'm going to be the Regional Executive Director! Which is true! It's a matter of semantics. Once you get in there, once you wow them, you'll go right to the top! What I said is, you will be the Regional Executive Director... one day. He looks pretty upset. - You manipulated me. - I had to do something. Otherwise, you wouldn't come with me! Look, I am doing you a favor by getting you out of this stupid hick town! By lying to me? Well, I'm not the only one who lied to you! - What are you talking about? - Carly. She's been lying to you for weeks. - I think I just heard your name. - My name? Yeah. Oh, come on. Anyone could see right through it, the way she's been playing you, trying to make you think she's still in love with you, just so you would stay and nothing would happen to these precious dogs! - She wasn't playing me. - Oh, see? It worked! How bad? The last time I saw Kristi this worked up was when that five-year-old crashed her live shot and she threw an ice cream cone at him. I don't know what we're going to do. - You! You're on. - What do you mean, I'm on? We're going live, unless you want to go deal with that. No, I don't. Then you! What? No! I, I, I... can't. You're cute. Here, do it for the dogs. What? You're already holding one. - You're a vet, right? - Yeah... Yeah! Just look at the camera, smile. You'll be fine. Love you! And in five, four... We're live! Hi... everyone. I'm Carly. I'm a veterinarian who volunteers at the Forever Friends Shelter. Kristi and Dan are currently predisposed with some other... dog business? - She doesn't even like that dog! - I'm sorry? That dog you're so in love with that hates everyone? - Carly adores Beasley. - Oh, please. Nobody adores Beasley. Carly's just telling you what you want to hear. Look, she comes back after all these years, expects you... to drop everything for her. Who's manipulating who, huh? Hey, listen, we just wanted to thank everyone for making this such a successful event, and for you folks at home, you'd better hurry up and get down here before your potential forever friend gets fetched up by someone else. I thought we were a team! - What is she doing? - Wait! It's live. Anyway... there's still one very special dog that hasn't found someone to love yet. Her name is Beasley. See, dogs are special. All animals are special, but... there's just something about the unconditional love of a dog that makes the world a better place... and they're a lot like us. Some are tall, some are short. Some are less friendly than others... and some are more trusting... caring... and like us, they just want to be loved. They just want someone to come home to... to know that they have someone who will greet them... to know that they have a friend. Sometimes, they actually do wish that things turned out differently, despite what they may have said... or barked... and... the thing about Beasley here is that she's independent, and I think sometimes, she worries that she'll lose that, so she tends to withdraw and close herself off... but she only does it because she's scared. She's scared that all those things that I just talked about, that she wants too, just like everybody else, that... she'll never have them. I don't think that she needs to be afraid anymore... because her path brought her here, to this exact moment, and there's nowhere else she'd rather be. Those of you who know Dan the Dog Man know what he says... that we don't choose the dog... the dog chooses us... and you see, I got up here today to help find this girl a new home, but... the truth is, I can't do that because... Beasley chose Dan... and she really wants him to stay... because she loves him. - I don't know what else to say. - Say goodbye. Goodbye. And we're clear. That's my girl. Thanks. - Oh, my gosh, that was so good! - Really? Yes! Maybe the dog does belong with you... and Carly. Yeah... she does. Goodbye, Dan. Goodbye, Kristi. Good luck in New York. Hi. Please don't go to New York. - I'm not going to. - You're not? I wouldn't do that to Beasley. I wouldn't do that to you. Carly... I love you. I always have... and I always will.
