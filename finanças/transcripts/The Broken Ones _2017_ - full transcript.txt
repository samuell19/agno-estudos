(MultiCom Jingle) (brooding music) - [Woman] You used to say, humans and birds have the same reaction to fear. (panting) (footsteps thudding) (cacophonous dramatic music) The difference between us and them? (eerie brooding music) We can't fly away. (birds chirping) - [Woman] Group meeting in 10! (brooding tranquil music) (chattering) - Can I, (claps), hi can I get everyone's attention? (serene ethereal music) (tense music) - Hey! - [Woman] I don't know though... (mumbling) - Virginia, take a seat please, give me that. (chattering) Give me that, no eating in the common room, okay? (rapping) - I told her that. - Okay good morning ladies. - Good morning! - Morning! - Okay, today we're gonna talk about feelings. - Oh here we go. - Ooh! (chattering) - Okay enough! - I have lots of feelings. - We all know this is feelings day today, this isn't news to anyone. - Do you want me to pass those out? - No, Virginia. I can tell some of you are maybe feeling a little frustrated. There's a card for that. So instead of projecting your feelings, come up here and grab a card. All right. Andy let's start with you. - Why me? - There has to be a reason? You've been here a while, you know how this works. - Blue, peaceful, it's the feeling card of feeling peaceful. - So you are feeling peaceful? - Yes. - You picked up a red and then put it back. - So what? - So why did you pick up a red feeling card if you're just feeling peaceful? There's a big difference between a blue feeling card and a red. The red card is the feeling of anger. - I know what the red feeling card is for. - So are you feeling angry, because you have to go home tomorrow to see your mom and your family? Maybe it's actually a yellow? - Fear. - Shut up! - [Woman] Stop it! - Maybe you're afraid, afraid to go to the memorial service? - Well look hey I'm not afraid! Here! (thumping) - Okay is there anyone else here that feels like they can relate to Andy's anger this morning? - No - Nope. - She's alone. - No. - Really? You're green? - Yes! - That's the feeling card for feeling calm and polite. - I am very calm and polite. - That is the last feeling card I would ever use to describe you! - Oh really? - That's very true Andy. - Fuck off Viriginia Slim! (chattering) What? - Stop it! Andrea, you've made your point. - Oh okay you know what I am just going to take my cereal and go back to my room. - Ooh! - That is (mumbles)! (chattering) - Virginia you want to go next? - I do (sighs), I do but she, she's not supposed to take food to her room. (ethereal music) (chattering) (brooding music) - Hmm! - Ah, yeah come in. - You're so lucky your mom is always sending you stuff! I wish I had a mom like you! Can she adopt me? - She would probably love to adopt you. Maybe we could trade places. Well, what are you doing? - I really want to open it, it's making me very anxious, not opening it, so, Andy if you could-- (rustling) Ooh! (giggles) Ah, well... Wow! (sniffing) Oh, that smells like heaven! (sighing) - You can have it. You know, you can have all of it actually. Except for these. (rattling) All right, I got to go to work. - What time are you off? I have some gluten-free cookies in the oven, I really need you to try them. - Uh, maybe when I get back. Save me some? - Try! - Good. You know, Roland always steals my cookies (chuckles). - Oh Andy! (ethereal poignant music) Um, you forgot this! - Thanks (mumbles). (sighing) (mumbling) Off to work Roland! - Curfew's 10! (bell ringing) Who is smoking? (eerie tense music) (pensive music) - Si! - It's me. - [Man] You're late Andrea! - A few minutes. (speaking foreign language) - Your Italian's getting good. - Grazie. - For you. - What is this? - Just open it. - It's not my birthday. - Uh-huh. For your six months sober. - Oh... I can't take it, it's too much! - No no no, you deserve it! - What does it mean? - That's Mother Mary, she will be your faithful companion. - Hmm, I'm not very religious. - Everybody needs a little faith, bella. Now get back to work, okay? - Grazie! (mumbling) (tense music) (wind whispering) (rumbling) (jangling rock and roll music) (tense music) (jangling rock and roll music) (tense music) (jangling rock and roll music) (tense music) - [Andy] Oh, this is dramatic. - Who are you? Go away! - I think I'll stay here. - I'd really appreciate it, if you'd go away. (crickets chirping) - Look, I don't know why you're here, but you don't need to be doing this. - That's exactly right, you don't know why I'm here, so please, go away. (distant train horn blowing) - So tell me, I have plenty of time. - All (mumbles), (train horn blowing) it'd be a waste of breath. - Do you realize how fast these trains go? - Yes, can you leave? - I mean they probably go as fast as a plane that's about to take off, that is a lot of speed! - Can you leave? - We gonna do this? Because if we are I am prepared, - We? - and the good news is, (mumbling) - No we are not gonna do this. Because there is no we! So please just go away! - How fast are (mumbles)? - You don't understand! - So help me. - Just fuck off! - I can't I'm involved now sorry! - Get out of here! - I (mumbles)! (mumbling) - Can't you hear that? - You hear that? - [Man] This isn't about you it's about me! - Not anymore! (train whistling) (cars shrieking) (train horn blowing) - You're fucking crazy! - Oh oh well I'm crazy? You know you really should be thanking me! - Thank, you... - If it wasn't for me, you would be dead right now! I'm not the one who was lying down on the tracks in the middle of the day drunk! I'm not the one with the issues here dude! (tense music) - You know nothing, absolutely nothing about me! You are the one on the tracks with me! (tense music) (train hissing) Hey! Hey! You know what you did back there? In some states it's highly illegal. - Oh, I'm sorry, for saving your life! - You know I could sue you for what you did! - You're like a five year old little boy. - (mumbles) 90 year old, old lady! - [Andy] Seriously, stop following me! - Can I come with you? - What? - Seriously, wherever you going, I'm in. Listen, let's start over. I'm Jim. - No no Jim, I don't need to know your name, I don't know you like that. - [Jim] Like what? So-- - Sh! - Okay. (tense music) I just want to say this is in no way-- - Sh! (water splashing) - Your turn. - What? No I don't believe in wishes. - [Andy] Have a little faith. - Faith? Yeah, right. - Come on, you got your coin? Hold it, tight. Close your eyes. Close, close your eyes. Okay. - This is stupid. - All right, this is your chance, to make a wish. Forget it, don't call it a wish. It's a bottle, with a message. Something that you want someone out there to hear. This is your chance. (water splashing) - Now what? - Ah, still trying to figure that out. Andy. - Huh? - That's my name. - That's a boy's name. - [Andy] Come on. (optimistic pensive music) (thumping) - What is this place? - What? It's okay, I know another way. - Whoa. (pensive music) Live here? - No. I don't live here. I just come here sometimes. - [Jim] Oh yeah, to get some food. - Cookies. - Hmm. - Gluten-free. So. - So what you do? - I work. - You work, you got a job, it's like, EMS. Eastern Mountain Sports. Backpack? Funny, joke... - Clever. (chuckling) No, I don't work at Eastern Mountain Sports. Moretti Cleaners. - Dry cleaners? - Yeah, (mumbles). You know I probably cleaned all your dirty clothes. - I don't got any dirty clothes. - No? What about hat dirty suit, lying on some train tracks. Might need to be cleaned. - Maybe. - Speaking of which, why were you laying on those tracks? - It's complicated. - I think I can handle complicated. Try me. - I just got out of prison. - Yeah right. - I'm serious. Pretty real huh? - Like, prison, prison? - Yeah like prison prison. - For how long? - A year. - What's prison like? - You keep your head low, that's what I did. Then you seem tough. - Yeah, you're a real bad ass. - Hmm. I got involved with some stupid, stupid stuff. I had a job in the banks in Jersey City. I got involved with some guys, my coworkers. They were doing some pretty shady things. Insider trading shit. Parents, they bailed him out but I didn't have that luxury. It was my boss really, he was the one. Lied to me from the first moment I met him. When the time came he threw me under the buss and that was it. - [Andy] What was your boss's name? - What was his name? - Yeah what was his name? - Walt. - Walt? - Walt. - Walt as in like, Walter? - Yeah like Walter. - Eww. - You don't like that? - Hi, my name is Walt! (chuckling) - Nice to meet you Walt. - Nice to meet you. I'm an asshole! - Yeah you are an asshole, you put a perfectly normal, innocent kid in prison. - Oh Jim, yes! - Yeah Jim, you know Jim all right! - Jim, I know Jim well! - Jim, Jimbo. - No, no no no, never, Jimbo. - Never Jimbo. Well never Jimbo thinks you're an asshole! - Excuse me, please do not curse in my office! - Excuse me shut up, this isn't your office, this is my office, shut up and leave! - All right, Walt is leaving. - Where you going? Hey, Walt! Andy! (door clattering) What are you doing, no, you're not hitchhiking! - Oh, come on, live a little. - Heh, this is... Not happening, never in a million years, are you gonna... - [Andy] Hey, I got two bucks, can I get ride? - Yeah. - All right, cool. Cone on! You said you wanted to go where I'm going. (unsteady tense music) - [Andy] Where are we going? - Jersey City. - No, no! Can you just do me a favor and pull over please? - No, don't pull over. (sighs) You need to trust me, this is gonna be really good for you. Be good for your health. - My health's just fine thank you. - Yeah I'm not so sure about that. - How's your health? (tense music) What are we gonna do here? Stare at the building? - Don't worry about it. We'll be right back, don't leave yet. - [Driver] (mumbles), yeah, thanks (mumbles). - Damn! - Fucking what is this place? - It's pretty. Brought us something. (tense music) Here, throw it. - You want me to throw it? - Throw it. - Throw this (mumbles)? So I'm gonna throw it at the building. - Uh-hmm. - I have a pretty strong arm. - I did quarterback. - I ran track. (grunting) (brick clattering) (metallic clattering) Shit! Which way was your boss's office? - Over here. (glass breaking) (brooding music) (bellowing) (glass breaking) (tense brooding music) (brick clattering) (alarm wailing) Let's go. - Okay. - Yeah. You too. Okay, goodnight. (pencil tapping) (humming) (knocking) - Smell my hair! - Oh, vanilla, nice. - Uh hmm, Andy gave me her shampoo, I can't stop smelling it! - Oh, do you know what she was doing this evening? - Uh, just work, why? - Well it's about curfew, she's usually in at this hour. - Do you think something is the matter? - Oh no no everything's fine. - Oh! They're gluten-free. Try one. - This, is fantastic. Are you sure Andy didn't mention any plans? - Uh-uh. - Well if you see her, send her my way, there's something I want to discuss with her. - Okay. (brooding music) (mumbling) - It felt good. - I had a feeling it would. - You got all the answers don't you? - No. - You have very pretty eyes. - (chuckles) Come on. - What? - I have really pretty eyes? - Yeah. You don't think so? - I mean, who says that? - I do. You don't think you got pretty eyes? - I'm not, I don't know. - Come on, you say that, but you do know. Everyone says that, I don't know. You know. - What color are they? - Black. Grey. I thought they were blue at first but they're not, they're grey. My mom's got them, green eyes. - Your mom? You think I look like your mom? - No. - Much better. - Listen to music? - Uh-hmm. Yeah. - (mumbles), I want to go to the city. (brooding music) (intense emotional music) (cacophonous dramatic music) (mumbling) - [Andy] Right now, I wish I was a bird. - [Policeman] Ma'am? Ma'am? (feverish music) - Hey. Hey. Hey, pretty green eyes. You okay? - Yeah, (mumbles). (cacophonous dramatic music) (Andrea panting) (tense brooding music) (tense brooding music) - What are you doing? This is private! What are you doing going through this? What did you see, huh? - I was just trying to find you... - You were just trying to find me going through my stuff? (Andrea panting) Ah, fuck! - Did you lose your dad in 9/11? - This is my favorite photo of him. He had such a good smile. (hauntingly poignant music) My brother's speaking at the 10-year memorial, in two days. My whole family's going down. People are literally leaving the city, and we're taking the early morning car in. It's twisted. - It must have taken a lot for him to do that. - Whatever. It doesn't matter I'm... I'm not going. - What do you mean you're not going? - I'm not going, so... - Don't you think your brother would like some, I don't know some support? - I don't need to explain myself to you. - If I was him I would just, I would want, I would want you there. - Crowds okay? They make me nervous. - Crowds. - Uh-hmm. - Fine let's go down there now. Let's go down, come on, there's no one there right now. - No, what, are you listening to anything that I just said? - Yeah I listened to you. I don't think that's the reason. When was the last time you came into the city? Andy... You made it this far. - (sighs) There is no way, I am going down there. You don't know what this is like. This isn't like throwing bricks at some stupid fucking building, okay? You don't understand. - I don't understand. (brooding music) When I was in jail, my mom died of cancer. I didn't get to say goodbye. Do you trust me? (haunting ethereal music) (poignant string music) - [Andy] So, what were you thinking taking me here? - [Jim] I had this crazy idea I was gonna cross the water, make a wish for this girl. - Oh, how'd that go. - Not as well as I planned actually. Someone once told me, you can throw a penny into the water, make a wish, actually let's not call it a wish, let's call it a bottle, with a message, for something you want to change, something you want to put out there. (water splashing) - You know it's funny. In a city that is so loud, it can just get, so quiet. - It is quiet. Fuck! (laughing) - Jim (mumbles), stop! - [Jim] (laughs) Why go on, try it! - Whoo! - Oh come on, you can do better than that. I'll go with you. - Okay. (both shouting) (poignant music) (shouting) (laughing) (mumbling) Where do you think people go when they die? - They're gone. - Really? That's what you think? - I really think that, yeah. - No. I think they watch us, like characters on a TV show, and then, when they want something to change, they just jump on our backs and make us do things. - Jump on our backs? - Yeah, jump on our backs. - Interesting theory. - Uh-hmm. - If they're on our backs why aren't they doing a better job of it? Why don't they pick up the pen and write us a letter and tell us they miss us or they're sorry or something? There are none. There's a sketchbook in your bag. You draw? - [Andy] Yeah, you know. - [Jim] Who got you into that? - One night, I was like nine or 10, I woke up in the middle of the night, I came downstairs and saw my dad, he was sitting on the couch, hitting the scotch. He turned around, I thought he was gonna scream at me. But he didn't. So I went and I sat next to him, he was sketching in his note pad. So anyway, I guess, I started drawing again. - Let me see them. - No. - Come on, show me your favorite one! Please? - You have to promise not to make fun of me. - Never. - Promise. Aw, okay, this one. That's Roland, she's a, she's, just this lady that I know. I caught her one day and she was standing in front of this window. She just looked so sad. I mean you can see it, in her eyes. - You're really good at it. - No, no... It's just a hobby I have. I have no idea what I'm even doing. - I think you know what you're doing. Can we go home now please? - Yeah, we can. (pleasant music) - (mumbles) jacket. - Okay, deal. (eerie whispering) (brooding music) (eerie whispering) (forlorn music) (metallic clacking) - [Jim] We gonna talk about this? - About what? - The scars on your wrist. (sighing) - Not much to talk about. - What happened? - I don't want to talk about it. - You don't trust me? - I don't want to get into it okay? - You try and kill yourself? Is that why, is that why you you're in sober living? - How the hell did you know about that? - You had your ID in your backpack. How long's this been going on? - Oh my god with all the questions! Don't you think we've had enough drama for one night? - You tried to kill yourself! - No I didn't try to kill myself! Why does everyone keep saying that? You know, you're were lying down on tracks earlier with a train coming at you! - All right stop! - Stop what? - Stop putting this on me! - Well I don't want to talk about it okay! - So that's it! This whole night! You're a hypocrite! - I'm a hypocrite? - Yeah you're a hypocrite! - How am I a hypocrite? If it wasn't for me you'd be dead right now! - Oh wait let's get one thing straight! I pulled you off those tracks. You sat down next to me, when that train came you didn't move a muscle. I pulled you off. So if it wasn't for me, you would be dead right now. - That's me, I'm fucked up! - You're not fucked up, you're beautiful! - I will hurt you I promise you! I will hurt you, I hurt everybody around me that is just what I do! - Okay, I don't care. - You don't care? - I don't care! - You don't care? - No. - What are you thinking, because you mom died, we have something in common? Because we don't! (tense music) - We don't. You know, you're not gonna be okay Andy. You're a victim, is that what you want to hear? Go on, why do you want to be alone, scared the rest of your life? Here you spent all this time trying to figure everyone out, you don't even know yourself yet! So when you go home take a good look in the mirror and see what I see. A scared little fucking girl. - [Andy] The thing is, with fear, you can only run away from it for so long, until it stares you right back in the face. - House rules are posted by my desk, look over those once you've gotten settled. Here it is, there's a closet over there, and your dresser. Your mom sent you a box of things, feel free to decorate the room any way that you want. Now Andy, Andrea this is unacceptable. - Those are prescription, you can't, you can't take those away from me. - Yeah this is a drug-free facility, I'm gonna need you to open up your bag. Now I'm not gonna ask you again. Okay... - Oh, okay you cannot take those, those are my art supplies, you can't take those away from me! - These are sharp objects, they could hurt you or one of the other girls. - Fuck you, fuck this place! - Hey I don't take well to piss-poor attitudes! Your bad decisions got you in here, not me! I am on your side, but the only person that can get you out of here is you! You got that? I want to see you downstairs in 30 minutes. - Well I'm not the one who's fucked up! - You wanna bet? - Bitch. - Downstairs in 30 minutes.

Okay, so first of all, I was with Andy last night so please don't get mad at her, because it was all my fault! She was just trying to help me. I just wanted her to know that, I wouldn't trade last night for anything in the world. I just want you to tell her. Listen, can you just, give her that. Please. - Okay. - Yeah. - Go now. - Okay, okay I'm going. You promise though? - I'll think about it. Please leave. - Okay. - This came for you. You really haven't had any slip-ups while you've been here. Minus the rumor I heard that you may have been smoking marijuana in the back. - Shit (mumbles). - Now you need to watch that profanity. - Sorry. - And this would be the first time you have missed curfew. - I just lost track of time. - I spoke to Mr. Moretti today from your job. He called me actually. He wanted me to understand how much he's enjoyed having you work there. He thought it was important that I know about your progress. - Mr. Moretti's a great guy, it's a good job. - Listen Andy, I know this is a hard week for you coming up and I don't want to have to punish you for missing curfew. I didn't even tell you mother when she called-- - You spoke to my mom? - Yeah she called this morning. She wanted me to tell you that if you don't feel comfortable going to the 9/11 memorial tomorrow, then you don't have to go. - She said that? - She said that. Can I give you some advice? - Okay. - Even if she isn't making you go, I think it would be good for you. Obviously it's your choice. (brooding music) - [Jim] Do you trust me? - Um, if I decide that I want to go, could somebody give me a ride home? - Ah, I think we could work something out. (brooding haunting music) (faint whispering) (mumbling) - [Andy] I have only slipped away... (whispering) (weeping) (forlorn music) (faint chattering) (medical monitor beeping) - [Woman] (mumbles) we had to pump her stomach out, (mumbles)... (sorrowful music) (mumbling) - I'm so sorry... Is that what you're going to wear? - (chuckles) I'm not sure I don't, really have anything else. - Oh I have just the thing. - (sighs) Well, a... - (stammers) I bought it for you, I was gonna take it back because I didn't know if you would like it or not, I don't wanns, you know, - No, mom, mom, mom! - get in your, face. - Thank you. - Do you want to wear it today? - Yeah, I want to wear it. (tense music) - Go try it on. (sighing) - Yes, okay. - Thank you Jesus (sighs). (brooding tense music) - [Andy] I uh, found something, recently, and I wanted to read it, to all of you, today. (tense music) - What is that? - It's a birthcam. I'm gonna document the whole memorial. - [Andy] She's letting you do that? - Well she said, whatever you need to keep this day from sucking, be my guest! - Huh. (mumbles) bro. - Thanks, (mumbles). - Look, sun coming. (mumbling) (tense cacophonous music) Actually it's nothing at all. I have only slipped away, into the next (mumbles) room. Whenever we (mumbles) to each other, (mumbles). Call me and (mumbles). - [Man] Speak to me in the easy way which you always used. Laugh as we always laughed together. Play, smile, think of me. (eerie haunting music) Pray for me. Let my name be the very household word that it always was. Let it be spoken without effect, without the ghost of a shadow in it. Life means all that it ever meant. (poignant music) Is the same as it ever was. There is absolute, unbroken continuity. What is death, but a (mumbles) accident. Why should I be out of mind, because I'm out of sight? I am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, just around the corner. All is well. Nothing is past. Nothing is lost. - [Announcer] The first memorial that we've seen, for the first time this morning by the families of (mumbles)... It is striking, how much creativity is involved in this, has gone into producing this memorial. - [Announcer] And it (mumbles)... - It's hard to believe it's been 10 years. They got all those streets blocked off, the security must be intense down there. I can't imagine what those families are going through. - I know. - [Announcer] Her best friend was working on the 96th floor of the (mumbles) tower, when it was hit by Flight 11. Andrea's father, was also (mumbles)... (chuckling) - Ah, ah... - [Man] One brief moment, and all will be - [Man And Andy] as it was before. - [Andy] Only better. Infinitely happier. And forever. (chattering) - No no, no the other way, there, there you go (mumbles)... - We will all be one, together. You also used to say, that birds don't have as good a memory as humans. I'm glad I can remember. I'm glad I can remember you.
