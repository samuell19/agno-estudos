A lot of people died fighting this far away cause... for Ibadi Muslims in an Islamic country, we who were there were very happy to die for the Sultan of Oman because they were under threat from Marxism. Those of us who were out there recognized the threat. Not the threat to our fathers -- my father was killed fighting Nazis. In my generation 20 years later we were fighting Marxist aggression. Which people forget about today. Well the Brits had just been chucked out of the Yemen, and the Marxist's had a foot hold just over the boarder in Yeman, and they were making the big push. At that time the Sultan of Oman had no money. He wasn't building roads or hospitals... and the people were in an easy state... from being promised by Marxism... that the world would be theirs -- if only they got rid of the Sultan. At the time we were in his army the 68/69 period was absolutely critical. The S.A.S. hadn't arrived out there. The Jordanians, the Iranians had not started giving any help to the Sultan. Where as Russia and China were helping the opposition to sweep into the Oman. It was very much a thin red line or rather a khaki line during the 1969 period. When we were ambushing these guys in the middle of nowhere heavily outnumbered and the fact that we were doing that and quite a few of us were killed -- I think is worthy of being remembered and this film helps that happen. I'm really supportive of the Operation Oman film. I think it's a wonderful idea. It's got the right sort of people explaining it. I think it's a wonderful film and I hope it reaches a very wide public over the next year or two. Only those have been to Dhofar can fully appreciate the severity of the conditions in which the polyglot force thought and flew; at times extreme heat; at others cold, wet, permanent cloud; and rugged terrain, the equal of which it would be hard to find anywhere... Those who fought there, including those who were wounded or died, did not fight in vain. Michael Carver - Field Marshal The whole of the Dhofar war is almost unknown in British military history. At the time we had quite a left-wing Labour government in the UK and to appear to be supporting a war for a monarchist regime on the one hand whilst at the same time moving out of the British bases in Sharjah closing down the Trucial Oman Scouts getting out of the whole region was almost politically unacceptable. Fortunately for the government it was the height of the Vietnam War the world focus was on Vietnam. In 1969 the Vietnam War was into its fourth year. The American and South Vietnamese Armies fought to protect south from the spread of the Communist controlled north. For the first time the realities of war were broadcast directly into peoples living rooms. The conscription divided the American nation. Protesters lined the streets of Washington DC while the world watched. But at the same time... in a secluded part of the gulf... a different kind of war was brewing. In 1969 Sultan Said bin Taimur invited the British Government to help him crush an uprising an uprising of Communist backed rebels in the Dhofar region of Oman The Dhofar Liberation Front angered by the Sultan's neglect of the Dhofari people threatened to rise up against him. Enjoying the full support of China... the Dhofar Liberation Front were well-financed, well armed and posed a genuine threat to stability of the region. I was aged 23 when I got out there. I had no real idea, because it was very difficult to find books that actually talked about Oman. apart from old history books. I think that the British government was probably frightened As were others especially those in the Gulf that Communism could spread If Oman had fallen I suspect it would've been a bit like the domino theory with various other countries falling to Communism. They basically controlled the Yemen and if they could defeat the Sultan and depose him... they would control Dhofar and they would control Oman. At the same time they would control the Straits of Hormuz where most of the world's oil travels It's a very narrow waterway so if you can control the southern end of it - you basically control the whole thing because you can stop anything coming through. Said bin Taimur was absolute ruler of Oman. Fearing in progress he had held Oman back from the rest of the world. Medical care and education were extremely limited and if an ordinary citizen left the country to seek education abroad they were not allowed to return. We're talking of a country that you almost expected Jesus Christ to come over the hill on a donkey. It was so behind everywhere. I mean there was nothing. There were no hospitals. There were very few schools. In Muscat and Mutrah there were shops... but they were souq type shops it was a very, very primitive country. To be honest, when I went out there although I didn't know it at the time, the war was lost to all intents and purposes and what had to happen was, really the Sultan had to go. (COL Ball) The country was feudal Said bin Taimur was the only one who knew what going on and he did not want progress. The Sultanâ€™s only son - Prince Qaboos bin Said was accepted into the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Once his military service was complete... the Prince returned home a virtual prisoner. Influenced by the West, Qaboos wished to modernise and educate the Omani people. He had no choice but to overthrow his father. British involvement in the coup has always been implied but never proven. The evidence, such as it is, with various aircraft being on hand to fly people in and out... there must be some element of collision. Equally stories of the Sultan Said bin Taimur being armed and shooting his way out... whether they're boys own stories or apocryphal stories I really don't know but they make good telling etc. But I think the key thing is... it was peaceful and it was accepted in fact there was much rejoicing because quite clearly if Sultan Said bin Taimur stayed in the country I suspect that events would not have turned out as they have now. (Maj Austin) As soon as he arrived on the scene the first thing he did was to give an amnesty to all those people on the Jebel who were fighting him. Desert Regiment, which were in Dhofar at the time were basically told to stop big time operations. would start to come over to the government side. Especially when the people on the mountains, on the Jebel, saw the transformation that was taking place and how education and general freedom was being allowed. And that nipped people like Mussalim bin Nafl in the bud because they had nothing more to fight for. In the same time because of the Russians and the Chinese helping out from the Yemen side people were taken to Peking and Moscow and trained and these were the hard core Communists who then took up the mantle from the D.L.F and called themselves The Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman. They were much more hard core and wanted to fight. They didn't really care, as far as they were concerned, they wanted to overthrow Dhofar, take Oman and then control the Straits of Hormuz. When Qaboos took over I think it was quite a shock for the Popular Front organisation because suddenly here was a ruler who was saying I understand your grievances. I believe they are genuine grievances and I'm going to do something about it. (Col Ball) There were places like the Abu Dhabi Defence Force. There was the Trucial Oman Scouts and they paid a great deal more. So the first thing you were going to get was somebody who was attracted to the Sultan's Armed Forces wasn't going there for the money he was going there for the adventure. Places like Aden had finished. Remember there were quite a few mercenary is in Africa, the Congo etc and all these were dying down. Well if you are a mercenary... because after all that is what a Contract Officer is you are still looking for places where you can find action. Most mercenaries don't go there for money so I think that is why... the Sultan's Armed Forces attracted those people. There were some nutters as well I will admit but we needn't to go there. Well it was all hard work. I mean there are apocryphal stories that one could tell of various people. People who were never sober and I'm going to get myself into big, big trouble here. I remember the advertisement said 23 and 35 was the age limit. So you had a lot of staff offices there. Who were needed obviously for the headquarters and we tended to look slightly down on them because one made friends, obviously with the younger officers -the company offices because we were the people who were always on the front line. If we were in Dhofar with the people who were actually there and we slightly looked sideways at the people who were not there but sitting in the comfort in the head quarters. But that's every. They're called R.E.M.Fs in Afghanistan and elsewhere. But nevertheless obviously somebody has to do it. But I have to be honest and say that most of my friends, who I still call friends, are people who were actually sitting on the front line, and we have a certain bond together. A message was sent to British Officers -- volunteers wanted for service in Oman. This is to be the first time Major Nick Ofield has returned to Dhofar in 40 years. He intends to return to the sites of three major operations that took place between 1971 and 1973. Operations Jaguar, Cyclops and Dragon. There's just one problem. At the time, maps of the region were virtually non-existent... and since then the grid reference system has changed. Nick has spent a year gathering clues and comparing them with satellite images from Google Earth and his diary. It's not going to be easy. I think part of me has always wanted to come back. It's the time of my life, when I look back, where I felt really alive. Difficult to describe. With a tremendous group of people. If they said they were going to do something-it was done. Your life was in their hands. Their life was in your hands. You trust them implicitly. People who did not perform did not remain. Later on in life... I found, working in some major corporations, that this was not necessarily the truth. People were out for themselves... and as much as one spoke about "teamwork" or "team building" that really was spoken very much tongue in cheek. Whereas in working in Dhofar in S.A.F. those were real teams This is about all the remains of the traditional old Souq. 40 or 50 years ago this would be the main commercial center of the village and this is typical of all the Souqs, in all the villages and towns in northern Oman. The Souq would be open from 8 o'clock in the morning till perhaps 12 o'clock. Then they would close during the heat of the day and would open up again, after prayers in the evening, round about 5:30 and then stay open... with the lights hanging down till 8 or 9 o'clock at night. As far as I know, it's probably the only remaining example in northern Oman. If this was cleaned up. The rubbish taken out, and everything was left as it was, washed and then sprayed... wouldn't it be bloody marvellous. Another 20 years... 4 or 5 more rain storms and this will all be washed away. Here was this little secret war that nobody knew about and these young men, because they were, everybody was 24, 25, 26 that sort of age were getting killed here. Its only because of their fighting, their command, their clearing of the enemy, the Adoo, that the country was able to develop. Had they not cleared the enemy out of here... the country could not have developed to the way that it has. So there is that feeling for them - a group of people who are totally and utterly overlooked. In some way... coming back is also a method of being able to pay my respects to these people. First on Nick's list is a position that was known as "Water Hole." The Dhofar region for 5 months out of the year... was covered in dense fog and scrub adding to the already difficult terrain. With limited instrumentation the jets and helicopters couldn't fly. It was hot and humid causing clothing to rot and metal would rust almost over night. Visibility could alter between 500 yards and 15 in a matter of minutes. It was slippery underfoot and boots wore out in weeks. The British Army had a lot of experience in hot climates from being in India for years and years. North Africa in the desert during World War 2... and afterwards in the Gulf. It's just a matter of essentially... drinking when you wish to drink. When you feel thirsty... but remembering you've only got a certain amount of water, water which is what you could carry. We never followed this modern trend of people saying... "I must get hydrated," and ordering people to drink on the spot. We never found that necessary. We took plenty of salt with our meals. As much as we could. You would carry with you a Parker to wear at night. So sometimes you would move out at night time in your shirtsleeves. You would stop and put on a jacket or sweater... and wrap a scarf around you... and then just before dawn you have to take it all off again because it was getting very very hot. In the morning you would turn your boots upside down and bang them just to check there weren't... any Camel Spiders or Scorpions inside them. Before you went to bed at night you shook your sleeping bag to make sure you didn't have any visitors. If you were caught you didn't expect to survive and [redacted] who was the Guardsman had his thoat cut when he was captured in 1971 I think it was. He'd had his foot blown off when RPG round his commando carrier and the others retreated and left him behind. After a couple of hours we went back to try and pick him up and get him out. The other side by then had got him and [redacted] was a big fellow. I'm told that... as our side came up to try and rescue him they cut his throat and left him. So we pick the body up yes... but if were captured you didn't expect to survive. (Maj Ofield's Diary) Mike had a contact on patrol at 10:45. The camp came under fire at the same time. After the first shot everyone was firing in all directions. Only one person claims have actually seen the enemy. CPL Murad said he saw 7 down by the Water Hole. If only we had a few grenades. Now very cold in the early morning. The wind blows all day kicking up dust. It's becoming a bit unpleasant. (Maj Austin) In August 69 when the Communists got the upper hand and started... bringing heavy weapons in they hit is really hard. So basically it ended up with S.A.F. having to move off the mountains especially in the monsoon period and control the plain and the rebels, the Adoo controlled the mountains. Really to make any progress we need to get onto the Jebel, which we have been doing, but we needed to stay there and that was how Operation Jaguar started. Each village had a Communist type cell in it with an informer. Nobody would know who the informer was. So the Communist group of five or six people might walk into a village, call everyone together... and walk up and shoot somebody and say that's because he walked out, he left yesterday and he went to such and such a place -- we've told you not to move out of here. So everything was very much controlled. The idea was to tell the locals - we're coming on to the mountains. We are going to stay on the mountains... and were going to make the mountains safe for you. This had been one of the enemies refueling points where they could get water so it was decided that we would sit on the Water Hole. Not an ideal position because we were surrounded by a number of hills. (Maj Ofield) The first position that was set up was at a place called "Madinat al Haq" which means the town of truth or the town of enlightenment. This was chosen because it was the territorial junction of about five of the main tribes so the Sultan was not showing any favoritism by starting at there. The Army, with the S.A.S. moved up, secured the place. Cleared these boulders that you see all around us. Painted one lot white. Said there is an air strip now get a plane in and the first plane was flown in by Chalky White and was always known by the Army and everybody else as White City. (Col Ball) We were under command of Special Forces but we were separated by miles and essentially we were on our own. I'd sit down with Nick (Ofield) and say where shall we go and to patrol today? You would listen to what the Firqa would tell you. You were listening to intelligence -- Intelligence, no that's rubbish, it was information that's coming in. They would tell you we think they're going to move from here to there so you would lay an ambush. No we made it up as we went along. Normally on Operation Jaguar you would have basically sporadic attacks throughout the day... but they would always give you a hammering at last light. Because they realized the Jets, if they were summoned up from Salalah, couldn't get up in time and they would be able to get away under cover of darkness. So normally just before last light there would be some sort of attack and it was a furious amount of machine-gun fire and mortar rounds and what have you. You were normally looking to the setting sun so it was difficult to see where the fire was actually coming from. The reaction of everybody was basically to go to ground and don't get up and I suddenly realized that actually I had to do something about it. My mouth was dry, I found it difficult to talk on the radio and then your training kicks in and you start to move and you start to coordinate etc. It was the first time I had been under fire as well. (Maj Austin) A lot of the enemy were trained by the Trucial Oman Scouts and there were one of two of them who were bloody good and they could drop a bomb on target first round in. Which meant that if you weren't under some sort of cover... there was a good chance of getting hit by shrapnel or what have you. (Col Ball) To come under fire from mortars is not pleasant because you don't know where they're going to land and I know that sounds silly but you don't. You know that they're coming in and you know that 40 seconds later something is going to explode. A Sangar could be no protection if it lands on top of a Sangar or in a Sangar you know that's the end. Ever since that action, and I came under mortar fire lots of other times, I could never control my knees. It wasn't that I was afraid -- but when I heard that boom, boom in the background my knees would start to go. The sort of wound you get for mortar... depends on how big a piece of shrapnel hits you and where it hits you. The bombs are designed to break up into as many small pieces as possible and work within a radius of something like 50 meters. When you adjusted fire with the mortar you would tend to adjust in leaps of 25 meters once you were on target to spread it around. But a steel fragment from at mortar at 25 or 30 yards... steel helmet is no protection and it would go through steel helmet. It's the most horrific thing of being of being under fire. Rifle-fire or machine-gun fire it's coming straight at you. You can get down. You can avoid it. But when it's coming straight on top of you it's very difficult, very difficult and you could be under barrage for hours at a time. You wouldn't get them all at once. You would get them every 4 or 5 minutes. Another cough, then another cough, then another cough and all the time they were aiming at you and you knew they would land within 100 square meters. But no, I think that's the most frightening thing. (Maj Ofield's Diary) We just started to come back when the enemy opened up. I panicked for a second and all I could send was... Contact. Wait. Out. The signaller was trying to get away from the ridge... and I was trying to get closer to see the enemy. So we ran out of flex on the radio. Most of the platoon went to pieces especially the gun who was firing without aiming. Still, I've now been properly bloodied so Mike is happy. There was another small-arms attack at 1900 or was it just a nervous century? I went out to set a trip flare in front of the position. I had problems getting to sleep because I was too warm... but now writing this it is very cold. Yeah it all looks the same now. Straight in front of us, running away should be a small Wadi that runs up into the position. It was the only place that was not properly covered. Now there were no instances of the enemy... creeping into a position at night time It wasn't Vietnam. So we weren't overly bothered. Then they crept into a Northern Frontier position in the Khareef, in the mist - in the monsoon and fired from about 5 yards away and two of our guys got it in the neck. So I took a patrol out one night to put a trip flare down in that Wadi, but what would be absolutely fantastic... is to see if those trip flare pickets are still there. and I think we could probably go and have a look at that. That would be something absolutely incredible. Go to the left of this tree, go out about 4000 yards, to where there is a lone tree up there. On several occasions the enemy used to come and set up a 75mm recoil-less rifle and fire at us from there. You would see them setting it up. You would see them firing it. It used to take about 35 seconds for the round to come and land here. Many of them landed on the left hand side of the position. But as soon as we saw them fire-- we used to open up with our mortars and put a line of smoke in between us. On the assumption that if they couldn't see where their shells were landing... they couldn't adjust. (Maj Austin) We couldn't dig down because of the rock, so you had to build up. Which meant travelling out getting as big rocks as you can so that you could make some sort of protection. And it was nearly all round protection... because you never quite knew if they might be coming up behind you, left or right flank. as opposed to coming in front So you had to have some sort of all-round protection. They didn't like us being at the Water Hole. They had what they called "Prayers" every day down in Umm al Gwarif. People came in and told what was happening in their sector the day before. It used to go -- Mughsayl? Nothing. Adonib? Nothing. White City? Nothing. Jibjat? Nothing. Water Hole? They were attacked by small-arms fire at 7 o'clock in the morning. They had an R.C.L. attack at 12 o'clock. They had another attack at 3 o'clock... and this went on for almost 2 months. That the place then, I won't say that it was famous, but every new small troop of SAS that came through came up to say "hello" and say "oh this is where it's all happening," although they had plenty of other stuff to do. (Maj Ofield's Diary) The Adoo put in a good small-arms attack from the west at 1700. It caught us by surprise. Attacked again at 10:45 Mazook seriously wounded. 6th of January, camp attacked 4 times. Saw 3 Adoo and opened fire. This was good, first time we've seen them before they've seen us. That's a tail-fin from one of our 81 mm mortar bombs. 1970. Do we bag it and tag it? I'm not sure about getting these on the aeroplane. I'll put it there and pick it up on the way back. Its day 3 at Water Hole and so far Nick has been unable to find his trip flare. I was so sure I could come back here - I know it's here. I can't see there being any possibility now. I wouldn't have put it this high. So disappointed because I've been thinking about this for years and years and years. About being able to come back and find it again. Someone has built a bloody house across it. This is the typical old style Jabali house. They put the branches, the roof up. We made the hill safe for them and they had nothing to fear of being out here. Fuck. I suppose there is a degree of mental satisfaction... that I was able to go and pick out the spot where I'd put it. That's not bad going is it? The Army's continued presence on the mountain -- convinced the civilian population that they were here to stay. Large numbers of the enemy surrendered. The commanders now turned their attention to a new prize. South of the Madinat al Haq was the Wadi Darbat. A well known enemy stores area. A few years previously, Jordanian Special Forces had tried to clear the Darbat but had been forced to withdraw after suffering heavy casualties. Dominating the high peaks over looking the Darbat... the enemy could observe for miles around, and its steep slopes hindered any attack. If they were to be successful -- forces loyal to the Sultan would have to take the high ground. It was planned that combined force of S.A.F, S.A.S, and Firqa, would try to take the west side of the Darbat. In what would become known as Operation Cyclops. (Maj Ofield's Diary) 21st of January, moved from White City to new location. Arrived at first light and had a fierce fight with the Adoo. Consolidated the position, built mortars and moved out at 0400 to the Wadi Jasire nearby. Contacted with 3 groups of Adoo on our side. Got well and truly pinned down. Jim had to do a fighting withdraw because of lots of harassing fire. There is obviously a large group of Adoo in the area. (Maj Ofield) Operation Cyclops - the idea was to move south from Madinat al Huq, down the west side of the Wadi Darbat and move the enemy away from it. Quite a large significant number of enemy militia had surrendered and come onto our side this was the start of the Firqas - the local militia. People are pardoned they came and joined the Firqa. I had under command, when I was at a place called Mugshal, the Socotrans. Socotra is an island off Yemen and they changed sides. So this was the big hearts and minds stuff coming in. Probably about 100-200 something like that had surrendered in late 70 early 71. They set about putting together a force... that would act as trackers, spies, who had families on the Jebel... knew what the enemy were all about and where they were going. So what you were doing was hitting the Adoo from within almost. And to be honest, at the end of the day, the Firqa as they were called, won the war. (Maj Ofield) The Firqa have never had anything in their lives and now suddenly found they could get everything. The actual walk across was delayed for 24 hours because the Firqa refused to come across the Darbat... unless all their kit was flown over by helicopter afterwards and after 24 hours negotiation it was agreed. So when I say what about flying 2 Companies kit across? The response was - "we haven't got enough helicopter for that." So my 120 guys walked across carrying all their packs, bedding, rifles, ammunition, cooking equipment - the whole lot and the Firqa carried their rifles and then they had all the heavy kit... flown over the next day. But of course it's difficult. What do you do? Tell the Firqa get lost? Then the Firqa don't come with you and they're the people who really knew the ground. The Firqa knew every track, trail, blade of grass-you name it. They operated there. It was their area, their tribal area in most cases. So they knew everybody, everything and the Wadis. So they were ideal guides and intelligence people. (Maj Ofield) The Jebalis were really hedging their bets. So there would often be one member of the family in the Firqa... and another member of the family still working with the Adoo because they were just really waiting to see how things turned out. (Maj Austin) They knew each other. They knew each other tactics. They knew where they went. They had cousins, uncles and aunts... on the other side as well as working with them. They were based in there tribal area. But if they knew that their brother was on the other side... they would tend to back off a little bit. You're hoping to bring him over to your side because when you surrendered... and you bought a weapon with you you got a reward. If you found other the weapons you got more reward. So there was an incentive all the time to... bring their brothers and cousins and what have you over to the Sultan's side and equally to find any arms cash because everything was worth something. After several days of contacts and fierce fire-fights the enemy retreated across the Darbat to the eastern heights. The decision was made to follow them. 2 Company the Jebel regiment, assisted by a small group of SAS and Firka crossed the Darbat in the dead of night, setting up position on the east side. (Maj Ofield) We started to build our Sangars and there was a cry of "incomers" followed by boom, boom, boom, boom, boom and 6 mortar rounds went straight through the position. The fire was so accurate that it was impractical to remain there and in discussion with the O.C. of the S.A.S. we decided we would turn south and move down to the mouth of the Darbat We moved about 3000 yards down to the south. Once we had secured both banks we were able to send in our own troops. In fact it was the Firqa because the Firqa were rewarded for anything that they found and a lot of them knew where the stuff was hidden anyway because they hid it. Once the stores and all the caves had been cleared out... the enemy remaining here only really had what they could carry. So it essentially finalized the security of the eastern area of the Jebel. The insurgency was Communist lead and one of the things that they were pushing was the fact that there was no god. In fact Islam wasn't really anything and Communism was great. This was a thing that upsets an awful lot of the local people. Which is why one of the first things when the survey teams did was to build them a little Mosque, get the Koranic schools set up, religion means a lot to them. But in the eight years that I ended up in the Omani forces there was never an incident, to my knowledge, where there was any clash... which had a religious cause. (Maj Austin )There has to be a degree of trust. Plus you have to be aware of who you are fighting with... and who you are fighting against. Its most important that if you're in a country which is inhabited by people who are a different religion from you - you have to conform. You cannot ride roughshod over them or anything like that. People just accepted we were Christians. We accepted that they were Muslims. You just be sitting there talking to somebody, you'd hear the call to prayers and he would get up and go to prayers - you just accept that that was part of the normal routine... and he would accept that you didn't go to prayers. Any radical element any religion, or sect or whatever it is, they become the enemy because they are the ones who are actually doing things to us. but there are many many Muslims in this country and other countries who don't take part in these things. I think it's too general term to say they are the enemy I don't buy that whatsoever. The tribes in this area felt that the Wadi Darbat was secure so we were no longer required. We had then been on the mountains continuously for nearly 6 months. So it was time for us to go... and we walked off. We are expected to carry all our gear after six months on the mountain and it was a 7 hour walk down onto the plains where they sent lorries for us to drive us into Salalah. And I really felt that was a demonstration of the army being at the poor end of the supplies. The SAS the Firqa got helicopter around most of the time, anywhere they wanted. In fact I was extremely irate and told the Colonel so. After six months on operation they couldn't just fly the lads off the mountain and made the march down with all their gear. That was not much of a reward for them. But that was somewhat rather typical. They seemed to think it was good for spirit. It did rather remind you of reading stories of World War I with the Staff Officer sitting 20 miles behind enemy lines. The odd person would fly up here and say "I'm sorry I can't stay they're having roast duckling in the mess tonight." When you're thinking oh god not tinned stew again for the 56th time. By the end of 1972 The area of the Jebel to the north and east of Salalah town was controlled by the Sultan's forces and civil development teams were making great advances. The opening of a position at Sarfait the the Yemen boarder had effectively cut off fresh supplies to the Adoo and it was considered time to deal with them in the central region. (Major Austin) The operation was 1 Company Jebel Regiment with attached mortars and nothing else. No artillery, no nothing. We were told we were going to go and do this operation. Paul said "I don't like it" "but we going to go down there" "and we going to patrol out" "until we hit something." And I'll tell you what - I was shitting myself. You don't go into a hornets nest with so little protection. One of the members of a patrol trod on antipersonnel mine. (Major Austin) I heard a muffled shout and then bang. The guy had lost his leg. Lost his bollocks. He'd lost part of his hands and what have you. The shit hit the fan big time. Everything happened at once. We had mortars in. We had RPG 7s screaming in. We had heavy machine gun, light machine gun, rifle fire. I'll never forget running and seeing the ground spurting up alongside me in front of me and behind me as somebody just ranged in. (Major Ofield) We were coming across airburst weapons which we had never met before. Which if they hadn't hit a target exploded after a certain time. So they were firing these into the air above us and these were exploding. (Major Austin) My signaller was wounded when an RPG 7 went off over our heads. I was laying alongside him and I could see bullet holes appearing in his radio set. Suddenly then he said I've been hit and he was hit in the leg by some shrapnel from the RPG 7. It was pretty obvious that the enemy was in great strength 30 - 40. Very well directed. Very well armed and of course within less than 1000 yards of their main arms and supplies they were in a better supply position in fact than we were. I was saying to Paul... "I haven't got any air panels" "but can you fire, from the main base" "some smoke rounds or white phosphorus to denote approximately where they are?" and then we can get the jets to come in and do some work. In the meantime on my National Radio this voice was saying to me "oh no no no no" which was the other side talking to me. So I had no communications apart from this thing which was obviously compromised because somebody was listening and talking. Anyway Paul managed to talk to the guys upstairs and they came in and dropped bombs in front of us. Okay I was in the shit big-time. The platoon basically run out of ammunition. We also lost 16 wounded out of 24. Helicopters in the meantime were coming in and getting people out under fire. It was incredible. They were so brave. There's a guy called Mike Hall who I remember came in time after time. (Major Ofield) I flew in with my orders group so they could be shown where to go. We debated whether or not additional troops... would be an advantage or disadvantage. The area we occupied was so small we felt that it will be a disadvantage. Paul wanted to see how the battle developed. Yesterday with the sun coming from the other side it looked so perfect and easy and we get here this morning and it all looks different. I still can't bring myself to walk on tracks. I know it's a camel track and it's 40 years ago. There's been nothing down here. But the bloody Iranians sewed mines like God knows what. That's the position down there. Right at the end of that Wadi going up the slope. Just this side of the crest line... was the initial contact point where we were pin down. They came down the north side of this ridge in front of us but they had to clear the ridge at the same time to make sure no enemy were in there. And of course being followed all the time up to here. With the enemy following them on to the ridge line behind. But this is well within mortar range... and they were heavily mortared... while on the top of this hill. As you can see there is no cover. It's just the nature of the ground we were fighting over. (Maj Austin) I remember I was so shattered - there were about six of us and we just walked. We didn't pepperpot. We just walked. There was probably a lull in the firing... because they'd seen that we were leaving. I remember we just walked gently... from where we were in the dead ground up the forward slope to the position and occasionally we'd get a shot or you see the bullet spurt but we were so knackered that we didn't give a stuff what was happening at the time, we just wondered. We weren't trying to be tactical anything. We got there and the first person who met me was my orderly and I said "Wahid" "where the **** were you!?" "Oh Sab" he said, "here is a cup of tea." And I said "Wahid you, you my friend"... whatever. Anyway I had the cup of tea. Went to speak to Paul. Paul was under 'Lone Tree' which is the only tree in that area, with his signaller and he said "Mike this is the worst day of my life." And I said "come on, come on chap we're are okay." Paul in the meantime was rushing around. I remember a bomb or something... landed very close to the tree that he was sitting under and he came dashing out from the tree dragging the radio by the handset only it was dragging on the ground behind him. I think his signaller had just been killed. I don't know... about half three... a couple of bombs came in. I heard them. I don't think he did. I heard them in the distance and sort of went like that. They landed very close. Within 10 or 15 meters. and then somebody came in and said... "Mike, Major Sab has been hit," and Paul was lying there. Oh he was a character. He was a character. He was very opinionated. He was actually a delight. Him being alive right now... he'd been godfather to one of my kids or something like that. If he'd been alive now he'd probably been in command of the S.A.S Commander of Special Forces and what have you. He was not only very efficient, well respected, but also very popular and it was very tragic when he was killed. In fact one of the main objectives in coming down to this position is to leave a marker in Paul's memory in the place where he fell. (Maj Austin) The helicopter pilots did a marvellous job. The Air Force guys, the jets did a fantastic job. Some of them were hit. But they got as close as they could, because they didn't know exactly where we were. By the time I last little group was ready to leave... it was almost completely dark. You still had this little afterglow of the sun going down. The helicopter that had flown in to take us out... but at anything below 5 knots I understand their instruments didn't work. So they couldn't hover... and they didn't know quite where we were. Now A) we didn't have any torches with us and B) we probably didn't feel like flashing torches... round because we were still imagining that the enemy were now creeping up on us because whatever happened it's obvious they would come and search the position afterwards. At that time almost everybody smoked. and myself and the Colonel and a couple of gunners... lit three cigarettes each and laid back puffing the cigarettes creating little glows up in the sky in a circle. Which the helicopter pilot was able to see and finally he was able to see those and came to us. Until we could reach up and get hold of the skids and guid him down to the ground. We got back and I remember... the New Seekers had a CD out at the time. I think it was the only one I had. And I remember listening to 'All My World's A Circle,' for minute after minute after minute. It was the only thing I could hear after all the noise and god knows what else and trying to unwind. That was a bad day. I started going grey. A very bad day. But I'd love to go back and visit the site. See if I remember anything... and just go back and walk the ground. That would be my ideal. Who knows maybe someone will pass this way again. Yeah okay. It happens. You know. Shit happens. You've just got to get over it, move on. I've only done that in a limited way. These boys in Afghanistan... I've had to meet bodies coming back. and sit with their families and that sort of thing and in life has to go on. You remember them. but you still got a job to do and you've got to get on with it. Much the same as in Oman to be honest with you - just get on with it. On December 2, 1975 the Commander Sultan's Armed Forces advised His Majesty Sultan Qaboos that "Dhofar was free for civil development." The war was over. (Major Ofield) Coming back to Oman for the first time in 40 years has filled me full of different emotions. To see the development is absolutely incredible. It's a totally unrecognisable. New houses farms obviously tremendous development on the Jebel and on the plain. Part of me is a little disappointed because aspects of the beauty of Oman have disappeared under this development. I feel a bit of a loss for the absolute peace and quiet that used to be here because now there are roads everywhere. Everyone has cars. I think obviously it's been a tremendous benefit to the Omani people. A little bit disappointing for us old reactionaries... that perhaps didn't want it to change. (Col Ball) It was a war in which... a small element of British troops took part in and I think one of the main reasons that it will always be a slightly lost war is because no British Soldiers, and what I mean here is the Private Soldiers the Non-Commissioned Officers a tiny proportion took part. So it didn't get a huge exposure. I think that's the reason why. It's a fascinating episode in our history. Will it ever become a major part? No I don't think it will just as Aden probably won't. But to those who served there... its a huge time of your life. Those are my thoughts really. I was so lucky so often. I mean I was blown off my feet by a mortar bomb which landed where you are. My smock was covered in holes, I wasn't even touched. I've literally fell to 12.7 round go past my cheek and burry itself into the sand bag behind my head. I felt a bit... I'd face death too many times. I felt nothing matters any more. You've done it you survived... and I left actually in August 74 because we were going back down south again... and I felt I've been so lucky so far... Is it going to last? Or am I unfortunately going to zig instead of zag and get hit by something. To say warfare is pointless - this is what everybody says. It taught me that sometimes it is necessary to use force to achieve and aim for the greater good. The definition of the greater good is up to the politicians. Perhaps then we trusted our politicians... more than we do now. What did I get out of it? A pain in the arse? You were young, you got over it. Lost a couple of good friends... together with several colleagues. But as a professional it's something you have to accept - it goes with the job. You can't say - I only joined the army to drive a lorry or to sit behind a desk - no. Everybody eventually has to be out there in the front line. It's a true case of 'put up' or 'shut up.' Those with the best training, the best knowledge, the best skills... and a little bit of luck are the ones that come out of it. You go back to Oman now you will still meet old Soldiers who say "ah yes Mr Mike I remember" this, that and the other. They're still so friendly. They still appreciate so much, which amazes me, what happened 40 years ago. The friendship which was established in the early 70s has carried on for 40 years. I believe that was built by the British seconded and contract staff during the Dhofar war. As soon as they know who you are, even though they probably weren't even born when we were out there. They've heard the stories they knew who we were etc, etc. Some of the old Generals are still around... but they're gracefully retired now. Of course they remember. But fewer and fewer are around, you know. Like the rest of us - we're all dropping off the perch these days as we get older and our memories grow dim and etc etc. Nick has come to the end of his journey. Here at the National Memorial Arboretum stands a monument for soldiers who died in the Dhofar War. At the top of the hill are all the names of British service men and women who have been killed in action since the end of the Second World War. The names of those who died in the Dhofar war are among them. Although the Dhofar war may have been forgotten by history, the names of those who died will always be remembered. "In recognition of all those who served in or supported the armed forces of the Sultanate of Oman and in memory of those who died in that service. Colonel Mike Ball was awarded the â€˜Sultanâ€™s Bravery Medalâ€™ for operations in Dhofar. Major Nick Ofield was awarded the â€™Sultanâ€™s Distinguished Service Medal for Gallantry.â€™ Major Mike Austin was awarded the â€˜Sultanâ€™s Bravery Medalâ€™ for operations in Dhofar. Major Paul 'Tiger' Wright was posthumously awarded the "Sultan's Gallantry Medal" Oman's highest award.
