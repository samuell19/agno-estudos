Something's wrong with him ﻿What's wrong? What do you ﻿He has a problem with the gear leg ﻿Well, I see that Tomer Arazi has a problem with the gear leg ﻿, But without a group, without an association behind it ﻿I do not see anyone going to fix this problem ﻿And that could very well be the end, of the competition for him ﻿Even before he first moved ﻿Technical Break! Technical Break? What is a Technical Break- ﻿Technical break, I got, I got ﻿Technical break, technical break ﻿? What is this nonsense ﻿And here's the red flag rising, that's it.

Even in the mirrors, of course ﻿How can I not stop thinking about him? If you do not stop talking about him ﻿Nimrod, keep your mouth shut ﻿Schuster, you're securing Nimrod from behind, sitting on his tail, yes ﻿Every time this clown approaches ﻿You're blocking him. Sand splashes, everything's going ﻿Didi, you're keeping Nimrod on the sidelines ﻿Two meters, no less, no more, obviously. "As if, make him the" glasses. ﻿"Forceps," degenerate", forceps" ﻿, Now listen carefully, as soon as I give the signal ﻿Schuster, you let him, get closer to Nimrod ﻿Didi, you invite him in, yes, as soon as he enters between you ﻿You start closing in on him ﻿He has nowhere to go, it's chess ﻿, Schuster, you take a sharp turn, enter it as if by mistake ﻿, You two crash on the sand ﻿You continue all the way to the finish line, clear - clear ﻿Nimrod, I asked if that was clear ﻿What is all these exercises for? ﻿I'm a better rider than him. I take it even without it all ﻿Let me open the form for him alone ﻿You started to develop a personality here ﻿I want to take this final. Like a man ﻿So do what you're told ﻿Kadima, guys ﻿Good luck, boy ﻿I knew you would come. How did you know if he did not know? ﻿To places ﻿Ready! ﻿We set off. Six riders very close together ﻿Their first challenge will be to get right into the first turn ﻿In such a tight-knit crowd, you don't win a race on the first turn ﻿But it is certainly possible to lose it in the event of an accident ﻿All six come out of this turn. While still in the game ﻿They have quite a few more such sharp turns ﻿Well. Come on Tomer! Tomer ﻿One coffee is already behind us. This is a crazy pace for the first coffee ﻿, Nimrod Golan. Motorcycle number, 7 currently leading ﻿, Right after him Shay Schuster and I see you too ﻿Reef Davidi swaps names. Places with Didi Barak ﻿, Pay attention to what's going on there in the turn ﻿It's very close. Between Davidi and Eyal Schuster ﻿Oh, Davidi was thrown out. From this sharp turn ﻿Now it's a battle between five riders ﻿The end Davidi will have to see from the stands ﻿.Eat ass, asshole ﻿The two laps are already behind us. It's a murderous pace for this age category ﻿Tomer Arazi seems to have weakened a bit ﻿I'm not sure he'll have the mental strength for the next three laps ﻿Nimrod Golan's jumps, so far clean ﻿He jumps in a full throttle and lands. Perfectly to increase speed ﻿Daniel Shaharbani is currently in last place. At a very great distance from him ﻿, You just talked, Eli, and here, 23 Arazi, increases pace ﻿He does not intend to give up, in third place ﻿Head to head with Didi Barak on the motorcycle numbered.9 ﻿Didi Barak and Tomer Arazi, enter the application together ﻿It's a strong right turn. It's shoulder to shoulder right ﻿, Pay attention to what Didi Barak is doing now ﻿He throws a rear wheel into Tomer Arazi's front ﻿And almost launches him .from this referral to the nearest ambulance ﻿I see the marshals there, with the flag in hand, it is not raised ﻿Which means they approve of the move, kosher but stinking ﻿This is the third round now, and it seems critical ﻿You can already recognize, the glue in the head ﻿It's tight, very tight ﻿Nimrod Golan is still leading, immediately followed by Didi Barak and Shai Schuster ﻿Stick to them, right to the exhaust of Tomer Arazi ﻿And you can see the urgency. The elbows in the narrow turns ﻿.It may not look good but it's legal ﻿The fourth round. We are just before the decisive round ﻿.They make a trap for Tomer ﻿It's a dirty forceps exercise. It's a classic Vazana ﻿Do not fall into the trap. Child, do not enter ﻿Nimrod, stay in the middle! ﻿Forget it. I'm taking it without nonsense ﻿At three, Schuster and I cut in half ﻿Stay close so he can not escape ﻿said no! ﻿Tomer Arazi is in position ﻿, Which is very difficult for the rider .when he is in the middle ﻿He can not get around. He's almost trapped in the center ﻿Tomer, go ahead ﻿Crazy! The two extreme riders cut to the center ﻿.And just collide with each other ﻿What are they trying to do there? It's just a rider's irresponsibility. ﻿Or maybe a lack of experience just in good luck- ﻿Tomer Arazi managed to slip away ﻿From being the third casualty, in this strange accident ﻿A lot, by the way, a lot thanks to the gap that Nimrod Golan opened for him ﻿.Now it's just two in this final ﻿Nimrod Golan, who leads right from the jump, and Tomer Arazi ﻿Daniel, the rabbi will probably have to settle for third place ﻿Come on, Tomer, it's yours ﻿.Well, friends, this final tight tight lead changes hands ﻿Imost every ten meters. This is the coffee. Lastly, there is no room for mistakes here ﻿Come on Tomer! ﻿I see Vazana did not knock you completely ﻿I'm taking this final alone ﻿Nimrod Golan is recovering now. He is back in the lead after this jump ﻿.It's still tight tight ﻿, Whatever happens at the end .An amazing ievement for a young and inexperienced ri ﻿, We are now before the last line ﻿And it's going to be tight. Up to the chess flag ﻿! Se! Se! Se! Se ﻿And the winner is Tomer Arazi ﻿Tomer Arazi is the champion of the regional council ﻿Tamar for youth in motocross for 2019 ﻿What a photo finish from the movies! ﻿, Tomer Arazi wins by a meter and a half, maybe three tenths of a second ﻿The last two years' champion, Nimrod Golan ﻿In third place is Daniel Shaharbani ﻿Second place, Nimrod Golan ﻿Nimrod! ﻿And in the first place, Tomer Arazi ﻿.second place ﻿2 You're not ashamed? I held a winner from you ﻿I kept a coach from you ﻿Do you know why I lost? ﻿Because Tomer has a coach and I do not ﻿See if you have any eggs.
