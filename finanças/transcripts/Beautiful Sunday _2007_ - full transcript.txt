If you want not to get hurt Stop idle talk and get rid of it Sang Tai Cho was released recently I knew it was moving again I think he was involved in Hyun Suk Kim's case. Do you have information? Based on the investigation report When Sang Tai Cho was arrested He owned 2 kg of drugs, not 200 grams The rest disappeared do you say Hyun Suk Kim somehow misappropriated the rest? I say it is possible This means that there is an informant swarm Maybe this was Hyun Suk Kim or... Wasn't that Detective Kang? Who arrested "Sang Tai Cho"? It is still too early to judge In any case, I know you are tired and busy but stay alert Locate "Sang Tai Cho" and his men And search for all the works he joined Damn, why did he have to make trouble? He took the money and was also honored. Wasn't that enough? What else did he want?
