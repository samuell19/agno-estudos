Come on! - Hello. - Watch out. My name's Stridström. I'm looking for director Anker. Could you tell me the way to his dressing room? By the props storage. To the right. Thank you, sir. Thanks for tonight's show. Monica Anker. Tommy Anker. Betty Anker. Charlotta and Karl-Hugo Anker. I wish to see director Anker. My name's Stridström. We've arranged a meeting tonight. We haven't got time. We're being interviewed. Take a seat with the others. - The others? Are there more? - There are always more. Always more? Excuse me. Perhaps... Allow me to introduce myself. My name's Stridstöm, man of letters. - Svensson - Thank you. Miss Svensson is also hoping for the big break. Yes, and I hope I get to meet him tonight. Ah, hope! The sweet and mad hope. What would we humans be without hope, miss Svensson? I've written a play, myself. Or rather a drama. About Ansgar. - Ansgar? - Yes Oh, about him? I'm very pleased with the result. It's difficult to cover everything... I've tried to limit it to 37 scenes, but if it's successful I'll write a new part. If miss Svensson'd like to hear about the contents to shorten the wait, so to speak, I'll be glad to share it. Yes, thanks, a little. Yes. It starts off with Ansgar as a little boy. Say what you will. I think Ibsen is overrated. Damned overrated. Take Peer Gynt, for example. Is it a drama? It's a patchwork. If you compare it with Strindberg... Dear God, why always compare things? Comparing is silly. Tommy Anker doesn't want to be compared to his great father. That's the poodle's real core. Possibly. Be glad that your name's Erikson and that you dad's a postman. - What are you doing tonight? - I'm meeting up with Harry. He's interviewing dad. The old fart loves publicity. - And you? - Hm. I'm going home to read Chekhov. - You're broke, in other words. - You could say that. It's on me. - Now, listen. - Don't worry. You can pay next time. How does it feel to have a sister like that? Well, I don't complain. Charlotta? - Yes? Are you going straight home tonight? How so? So you're not doing that? You see, we've got a meeting in the theater society tonight. You had one last week. That was a feast. Tonight it's about the committee. What committee? I can't tell you. It's a secret. Why? Dear Charlotta, those who have sworn the oath cannot share anything. Right then. Aren't you going to wear the badges and medals tonight as you usually do? No, that's only on special occasions. And I can do without the ironical tone. What charities! We are of great use to our poor colleagues. If so, you don't need to look like Christmas trees. Be home at half past 1. Dear Charlotta, we don't meet until a quarter to 12. and we have many matters to discuss. Half past 1, I said. You're close to 80, remember. Close? I'm 74. I feel 55. Yes, until one day you lie there. Alright, 2 o'clock, not one minute later. - Yes, yes. - And no punch. You know you can't handle it. - Quite right. - Can I trust you? - Yes. - Good night. - Good night. Don't assume I've gone to sleep when you get home. No. Good night, darling. - Bye mum. See you at home soon. - Good night, my child. What are you doing tonight, Betty? - Stefan probably has visitors as usual. - Indeed. Shall we eat out? I'll take you soon. What about grandfather? The theater society. Meeting of a secret committee, as he called it. Which means that he and Jonny Nilsson and Brofeldt will be boasting to each other about their own greatness. They're very cute. Indeed they are. But grandpa must be disciplined. - He's not a youth anymore. - No, that's true. He's not more than one year older than granny What did she say? I want to run my own theatre, as long as I can pay the wages. As long as I can afford it. I hope to God I'll run it till I die. You must understand... The theatre is my home. My home, my life, my religion. What do you think about the actors joining The Confederation of Trade Unions? It's horrible. I don't want a 1 May with the slogan 'Equal roles for all'! No, I'll tell you... The day actors join the trade union, that day Thalia draws her last breath, in relief of avoiding bureaucrats and bores. No. Theatre! Theatre should be a feast, and its performers should be gypsies. Hello? Hello. Is it really you! What are you saying? You can't be serious! You don't realise what you've done for me. Not only for me, for the whole family. And the ensemble. Sure. Thanks, I'm a little busy. I'll call tomorrow. I have it! I have it. I have it! Is it Moberg's latest play? Play? Christmas ham, of course! Where were you? They'll be gypsies... Yes, well, at least a few drops of gypsy blood in their veins. And get a good photo for this, and the usual two columns. Of course. Thanks for the help, director Anker. Thanks. It was nothing. Good, no? I couldn't have said it better myself. There you are. What do you want? I just wanted to say goodnight. Thanks for tonight. Well, thank you. What did I say about your entrance in the fourth scene? Isn't it better now? Yes, you're right as always. Well, concerning theatre, at least. Tell me, dad... You have no money? Yes, I have, but... How much does Rolf Eriksson get paid? I've no idea. How so? Do you believe in him? In Eriksson? Oh, yes, I certainly do. Is it he who's out of money? I'm afraid so. - Yes? - Mille. - Fetch young Eriksson. - Certainly, director. Not a word about me mentioning it. You're in love with him? Not really... but he's kinda cute. Good night. Good night, sweetie. "O sweet youth, you are..." "you are..." How the devil does it continue? It doesn't matter. Enter. The director wanted to speak with me? Yes. Come over here. What's your monthly salary? 250 kronor. Do you think you're worth that? Well... Answer! Do you think you deserve 250 kronor? I don't have good looks, of course. I never went to drama school... I can speak lines at least, as best I can. I do 3 roles every night. An extra earns a fiver at least. Ever thought of getting another job where you can earn more? There's no other craft for me, director. - Hello, dad. - Hi. Well, from the 1st onwards you'll get... 300 kronor a month. Take these and go out and celebrate the evening. Here you go. Don't look so frightened. Nothing to be frightened of. Thank you very much. Thank you. What? Do you... Do you remember when I was that age? Yes, you did "Monna Vanna"! Yes. A poorer performance is hard to find. I remember I thought I was good. Quite wonderful... And now I've grown old. - Very old. - Well now... You do look young, though! You think so, Mille? Maybe I'm not that bad after all. Will you be late? I think so. There are lots of people as usual. You get too little sleep. You can't keep doing this. Sleep is only an old bad habit. He got that from his dad. They're both impossible We're not impossible at all. It's you who carp and bicker. Watch yourself, before I go to a lawyer and file for divorce. Run off to your secret committee. If you come home after 2, I'll give you committee! My sunshine. - Good night, my friend. - Good night, Mille. - Night, dad. - And don't forget the punch. - Yes, yes. I want a steak tartare tonight. Dear mum, that can't be healthy. Mind your own business. - Come on, let's go. - I'm coming. - Good bye, Stefan. - Good night, mum. - Good night, Mille. - Good night. - Good night, darling. - Good night to you. - Come as soon as you can. - Of course. Good night, Mille. Good night. - Agile parents I've got, Mille. - Yes. I wonder what could break them. Not being able to go on stage anymore, director. - So they accepted it? - The staff was crazy about it. You can collect the money tomorrow. I don't care about the money. I'm just happy it got accepted. Listen, ever thought of becoming a journalist? Not as a profession. An Anker is born actor, since the end of the 18th century. Traditions must be maintained. A shame. How so? Holmkvist might quit, you see. If so, they need a a replacement for the theatre column. Well, there's not much money in it, or things to do, for that matter... But once you're inside, possibilities arise. That would be swell. But an Anker is born on the planks representing the world. I don't dare think what dad would say if he found out I wanted to be anything else than an actor. - Know what I'll do with the fiver? - No. First, I want my shoes half-soled. Then I'll buy the collected works of Shakespeare. There are cheap versions. Then I'll buy Strindberg's plays, and Chekhov's. It must be wonderful. What? To love something as dearly as you love theatre. Yes, it is. I believe I couldn't live without theatre. Preferably rehearse every day and perform every evening I wouldn't mind sleeping there too. I wish I could feel the same way about it. You do, but you're not aware of it. I don't think so. I'm to theatre as the baker's child is to pastries. I got enough of it long before I understood what it was. It'd be great to be in a successful play, read praising reviews, and be celebrated like the great actresses. But that feeling is worth nothing. It has nothing to do with true love of theatre. To give of oneself, and to sacrifice all for art, that's how one should feel. Otherwise one should do something else. I've nothing to win in this world, and soon in my grave the maggots will find, that I am quite skinny round the legs, as I am round the arms and neck. How long are you allowed to stay out tonight? Allowed? I can stay as long as I want. Well, of course. - What'll we have with the coffee? - Yes. Punch! - We'll start with a half... - Punch, of course. I'm not sure. The punch's not good anymore. I'll give you a pill. Charlotta won't notice a thing. I'll drink as much punch as I please. But it's not as it used to be, back in the good old days. Do you remember, boys, when we sat at Rydbergs? Oh, the days... Free drinks... the steak cost 75 pennies. Charlotta wasn't at home waiting for you. Yes, in fact she did. I was happy about it, and I am still. You're just sulky and jealous because you didn't get her. I clearly recall how you watched her. But she chose me! Miss, half a punch. Cold! Is it tasty? There's nothing like a steak tartare. Cheers. I thought he looked tired tonight. - Grandfather? - No, Stefan. Karl-Hugo never looks tired. I wish Stefan looked as fresh as him. Anyway, I bet he's drinking punch. It can't harm. Well, so you say, who doesn't lay beside him. You should hear him snore. I've listened to it for 52 years. Well, not every night, at least. Almost. Has Stefan set a premiere date for "Swedenhielms"? No, but it'll be in a month or so. It's a good role. But I don't know if it suits me. She's damned fiery, the woman. It'll be fine, mum. You'll see. I'm more worried about Tommy and Monica. Not easy roles. And Karl-Hugo doesn't fit as a loan shark. It's supposed to be an underling. If he comes home after 3, I'll handle him! Do you think me portraying Stefan's daughter will look odd? No. Not if he looks as old and tired as he has lately. He'll work himself to death. A dram with the coffee, no? Let's go to my place and have a grog. I'm not sure. What time is it? - Half past 1. - Half past 1. Well, I... I actually feel a little tired. Perhaps it's best if one goes home to bed. O Charlotta, Charlotta. It's not because of her at all. I'm playing tennis tomorrow morning. You'll need a drink then, or you won't hit the ball. Come along. Half an hour. Not more! Let's go then. Yes. When Ansgar later came to Björkö, he found... No... Is the lady listening? Is the lady listening to what I've... Yes. He went ashore... On Björkö, yes. Ansgar has grown a beard by now. The whole scene is in complete darkness. But the light slowly starts to... Your turn, Mr. Stridsberg. Stridström's the name. What time is it? A quarter to 3. I'm so tired. I don't think I'll manage to rehearse tomorrow. Good day, good day, director. Or perhaps I should say "Good night, good night". I must thank you for a wonderful show tonight. Completely magnificent. Gustav Vasa himself would have been very pleased. Thank you. My name's Stridström, man of letters. Now to Ansgar. - Ansgar? - Yes. It's my pet drama. Drama with a capital P. You promised to read it for today, no? It'll be here somewhere, I assume. Well, in that case, those are unread plays. I know. I'll have a look here... I can guarantee... A... A... Andersson. No, this is the phone book! What's this? I'll read a little piece... Please. I've read your play. - Oh, so you have read it? - Yes, it was very interesting. - Interesting, no? - Extremely interesting. I must say. And what a part for the director. What a part! I see the director in front of me now as Ansgar. Not as a boy, of course. That wouldn't be possible. But as a grown-up. Really? You're cut out for it. Cut out for it! Well, listen dear Stridström, please don't repeat everything you say. I'm in a hurry and it's late. It is, it is! I'll just ask when I may expect the premiere to be? Not this season, I assure you. - Not? - No. Come back with it in the autumn. What a shame, Ansgar is more of a spring play. - Possibly. - It is. I don't dare. I need a summer, a whole season, to consider such a great piece, a great drama. I see. That's kind of you. Very kind. I'll return when the autumn leaves fall. If I come up with any idea in the meantime, I promise to let you know. I promise. I already have a little idea. I have. An excellent little circus piece, with voices. Anyway, for now: Ansgar. Bye, bye, and thank you, master! Ansgar... What idiocy. I've never seen the likes of it. Miss Svensson next. I can't receive more tonight. I'm tired. But you've promised. No, I must sleep! She's waited six nights in a row. I can't... She's brought a pianist too. Pianist? She sings? But this isn't a musical theatre. But you promised her. For God's sake, drag the piano onto the stage. and I'll listen. I'm going mad. Voices... Ansgar... No! Well, bring it on. What is it? I'm going to sing the entrance song to "Fair Helena". Yes, begin, little miss. "Fair Helena". Looks completely mad... O glow of love, O warm flame Adonis, Venus, praise be unto you. The flame that once was... When do we loose the rights to Coward's play? Next week, I think. We must send a telegram. no longer burns. Hear us, Venus. Hear us, Aphrodite. Hear us, Venus. Hear us, Aphrodite. We need love. If only a little. We need love. Yes, we need it. We need love. If only a little. We need love. Yes, we need it. I've got an idea. Thank you, enough, miss. Shan't I sing more? No, not tonight, miss. Quite enough. Your name again? - Svensson. - Svensson! Won't work. Nobody would want to see a fair Helena named Svensson. - What's your first name? - Sonja. Sonja! Not bad. Sonja Sven... Sven... Sonja Swedje. Your name from now on. Come to my office tomorrow at 4, and we'll sign a contract. - How much do you want, by the way? - Well, I don't know... Miss, please decide. How much you want? I'm in a hurry and it's in the middle of night. How much do you want? 300... 400... You're mad. You'll get much more. Four o'clock, then. And get a new hat. Is nobody awake? Betty! What is it? I've got an idea for the next schedule. Fantastic! Wake the others. I'm going to the kitchen. I'm as hungry as a wolf. Fair Helena... Monica. Are you asleep? Wake up. Dad's got an idea. He wants us to come to the kitchen. Why does he always get his ideas at night? Well. Hurry. Tell Tommy, please. Yes. Well, you're home. No, it's me, mum. Stefan's got an idea. What idea? I don't know. He wants us to come downstairs. But if you're tired... I'm not tired. But I'm furious. It's nearly 4 am, and Karl-Hugo's not home yet. You go down. I'm coming. Tommy. Get up. What? Don't tell me he's gotten an idea. Yes, and we're going downstairs. Oh Monica, we'll grow old before our time. Is he stupid or just a genius? I don't know. Prepare for the worst. Why's there no steak? What? Hulda promised me steak. There was none in the department store. The department store? I could've gone somewhere else. No salt and pepper now. Bullen says... I don't care about Bullen. This is veal cutlet done my way. She promised me steak. I sat all night and getting ready for a steak. Lamb chop is good too. That might be so. But when one has sat through an entire evening, looking forward to a steak a large, delicious, nicely roasted steak. it's a letdown getting a sad lamb chop. Don't act like a spoiled brat, Stefan. Am I spoiled? I was promised a large and lovely steak. With plenty of onion. We've heard that. But it didn't turn out that way. Well, what's this idea of yours? Well. We're not putting on "Swedenhielms". Oh? Our material has been too serious this season. People want to see lighter things. The revues are successful. You don't mean that you're putting on a revue? Dear dad. Have I said that I want to put on a revue? No! We'll play an operetta! Classical operetta! Grand, melodic operetta! An operetta that all Stockholm, all of Sweden, the whole world have loved, that they haven't seen in years: "Fair Helena". So? What do you say? Well... Who'll be Helena? We don't have a Helena. Yes, we have. An hour ago... Her name was Svensson, now it's Swedje. She looks horrible, and has no concept of theatre. If I handle her, she'll become a great artist. Great! Fantastic! She's in fact got that which people want to see. What about Pâris? Who'll do Pâris? What a silly question. Who'll do Pâris? There's only one who can do Pâris. Who? I, of course. You?! What's wrong with you? You don't think I can play Pâris? Name one who could do the role better. And looks better. No, Stefan, but he must be able to sing too. No, sing... sing... I have a very pretty voice, I tell you. It's not big. But I'm musical through and through. When I was in Helsingfors, 1909, I did operetta 7 great parts! But was that successful? Don't be impertinent with your father. By the way, I needn't sing a note, if it doesn't suit me, as Pâris. I can whistle the part. What now? I've whistled, I tell you, with a symphony orchestra. And I whistled excellently. The audience will do so too. If you take that tone, you might as well go to bed. Listen, If you've woken me to listen to your mad ideas, I stay up as long as I wish, - Mad? - Calm down, mum. Stefan... Do you think the audience would want to see you, the great Stefan Anker, as an operetta star? Yes, of course. Never! No? One moment. Hulda. Hulda, wake up. Dear director, there was no steak left. Steak? That doesn't matter. Do you remember 'Fair Helena'? Ah, with Anna Norrie. "Say Venus, say..." That's right, Hulda. It'll be our next show! How wonderful. Can you guess who'll be playing Pâris? Young Tommy? I, of course! The director? Of course. Don't you think I'll be great? Yes, of course. Thank you. That's what I wanted to know. Good night, Hulda. Sleep well. He means Menelaus, of course. What shall we do with him? Just play along with him. Otherwise he'll definitely do it. We'll say it's pure genius. What did I tell you? Hulda couldn't imagine anyone else playing Pâris. And there are thousands like her. Don't forget it was as romantic lead and Casanova type that I made my name. Dear dad, that's 25 years ago. 25 years? What about later? 25 years... So what? I just ask: Has there, during these 25 years, surfaced a single new man in Swedish theatre, with my masculine charm and sex appeal? No, there hasn't! Isn't it hard carrying around that many inferiority complexes? Go on with your sarcasms, mum. You know I'm right. Yes, of course you're right. But later you've shown that you have greater artistic talents. Yes, I've played mad kings and been praised by the critics. But then it's the mass audience - they don't want to see me as some loony monarch, however brilliant. No, one can't be bothered to keep on playing grand drama every night. One should rest one's talents every now and then. On that note, it takes equal talent to perform farces and operetta as acting great tragedies. But the idiots don't see that. Isn't "Fair Helena" rather old hat? Indeed. Very old hat. But I'll give it a brand new look. There won't be a trace left of the old operetta. There will be new lyrics, new libretto, new script. People won't recognize a thing! It will be a premiere for all Stockholm to rave over! Oh, Charlotta. Little Karl-Hugo... Are you still up, dearie? Yes, can you image. Oh, you see... Yes, yes. Save your explanations for tomorrow. Go and speak with your son. He's gotten a mad idea. He plans to perform "Fair Helena", and he'll portray Pâris himself! Yes, and you'll do Menelaus, dad. Never! Karl-Hugo in an operetta? At his age... Oh, endless complaints about my age... I'll be glad to do Menelaus. It's a fun part. He's an idiot. So are you. If you're performing in an operetta, I don't want to be married to you anymore. Oh, dear. Quiet! Hello. Is it Ernst? Yes, what is it? Yes, I certainly did. It's past 4am. Normal people sleep at this hour. Possibly, but I'm not a normal person. Thank God! Listen... We'll drop "Swedenhielms". We'll postpone it. We'll do it later. No! In a month, on January 12, my birthday, we'll perform the premiere of "Fair Helena". Helena, I said! That's right. It'll be a spectacular premiere! You're not going on stage dressed like that? Yes. What's wrong with it? If you go on stage with that nose, Karl-Hugo, I won't be in the audience. Dear Charlotte, it's an operetta. It's supposed to be a little exaggerated. A little exaggerated... Look in the mirror and repeat that expression... Well, it is... Maybe a little too big. No, it's cute... You look like a cross between Diogenes and an elephant. Maybe it'll fall off when I sing. You can use it as a trumpet instead. That won't surprise anyone. Oh God, it's ringing. You must go. I'll make it smaller. The kick! I'm so nervous. Why did I say yes to this? It'll be fine. But make the nose a little smaller. Into a forest on the hill called Ida. 'Ida'? How the hell can one name a hill 'Ida'? Why on earth didn't you stop me? It'll be a success! Damn! What an idiot I am. Me, as a singing Casanova, with this voice! I need a legal guardian! If it's a fiasco, it's your fault, I tell you! You didn't stop me. It won't be a fiasco. Turn round. That's better. Just mind your acting! My acting? What about the voice? The voice! In a forest on the hill called Ida. Nervous? That's not the word. It's worse having dad and granddad on stage than being there myself. - It must be a horrible profession. - It's terrible when you get nervous. People in general believe that theatre is nice and easy But of course it isn't. Ever thought of quitting and do something else? Well, what? Housewife and mother, for instance. One could combine it. Not in the right way, I think. I wouldn't like having a wife who'd come home tired and knackered after rehearsals barely have time for dinner and head off again at 7am, with me sitting alone til half past 11 to see her... Göran, I haven't proposed to you. Monica... You know what I want. I love you. Through all of the years I've been away I've been thinking about you. There's nothing I want more than marrying you. But then you have to leave the theatre. Otherwise it won't work out. Do you want to? Say that you do. I don't know. Theatre is still my life. It has always been. It's not easy to break all bonds. Even if one is in love. Monica... Give me some time to think. I'll decide what to choose - you or the theatre. Who's the lad sitting with Monica in the box? His name is Walsenius. An old childhood sweetheart. Quite nice. Lots of money. His father is head of the shipping company. How so? I was just wondering. It's her entrance. O glow of love. O warm flame. Adonis, Venus, praise be unto you. The flame that once was our delight and menace in our chests no longer burns. Hear us, Venus. Hear us, Aphrodite. We need love. If only a little. We need love. Yes, we need it. Isn't she great? Yes. You've performed a miracle. No, our lord has performed a miracle. How does it seem? It's splendid. Both charming, and matching It doesn't matter that they can't sing. How was I? Didn't your hear the applause? Yes, but I wanted to hear your opinion. - Well. - Well? You were terrible. Was I terrible? Yes, you were. But you were funny. Very funny. Of course the old man noticed I hadn't put make-up on my legs. He's crazy. What's the matter? Why so dour? Nothing in particular. I don't like running in and out as an operetta greek. Not much fun. As dad says, it can be useful to rest one's talents. Only if one has had success - if one has a secure income. This is the first time I've heard you talking about money. By the way, you did get a raise last month. Well? You sing very well. Well, one can if one wants. Do I look good? You know you do, you goof. Not a day older than 35, no? Not a day older than 30. You say so? But she... She's wonderful. Or what? It's the new big name. The woman's got dramatic talent too. Next time I'll let her play a speaking part. I hope there'll be room for me on the repertoire too. There's always room for you. Darling, we won't have to get in each other's way. "Entertaining night at The Royal Theater" - Good morning. - Good morning, director. I'd like to purchase a copy. Of course. We're not allowed to sell them this early. But since it's the director... Thank you. And I must congratulate you on the success. It went well as usual. Brilliantly. - Good morning. - Good morning. Well, how is it? What are they saying? Splendid. They worship you. Drive to the Daily News office! Yes, director. It's not true. I can't believe it! I've got you to thank for everything. No, I should thank you, my darling. Did you mean that? Of course. I've got you to thank for lots of things. But you said 'my darling'. Well, I did... It's a habit - perhaps a bad habit - that theatre people have. We call people we like 'darling'. Perhaps your family and the other guests thought it strange that you drove me home. No, I always buy papers after a premiere. Alone? Well, yes. It varies. Are you worried about your reputation? No, but about yours. No answer at his office nor his dressing room. It's been an hour since he left. We know dad. He's met a journalist. Or he's with some cab drivers, sitting in a bar discussing the big questions in life. That's how he is. He could've called, at least. No, enough, Karl-Hugo. Let's go. No, enough, Karl-Hugo. I want to read the reviews. You can do that tomorrow. We know it was a success. Aren't you too going to bed? No, I'll wait a while. He'll be here soon. Well... Good night. - Good night. - Good night, grandma. - Come along. - Yes. Come along! - Good night. - Good night, grandpa. Could something have happened... I'm getting worried. Maybe he's been in a car accident? No, mother dear. But this is not like daddy. We always read the papers together. The whole family. Göran thought it was a wonderful show. Oh? That's good. Göran seems sweet. Nice and well-bred. Yes... Shall we call the hospital? No, dear mum, nothing's happened to him. "Swedenhielms" got cancelled. We'd looked so forward to it. 'Helena' can't run for ages... There will be no 'Swedenhielms' show. I can feel it. Dear mum, don't be so gloomy. You're tired, that's all, after all the excitement. Let's go to bed. He'll be here for sure. Shall we not call? No, there's no need. Come now. Miss Swedje here. Has there been any calls? Not? Please don't let calls through before 12. It could be one of the papers. Hello. Miss? Only if it's one of the papers. Thank you. Am I interrupting? No, enter. I wonder where they are... It's been one and a half hour since he left. I've got a suspicion. Her? I'm afraid so. Tommy, you can't mean that. He couldn't. Dear Monica, our father's not 50 yet. And miss Swedje is quite attractive. He's been married to mum for 26 years. Makes it more plausible... Listen, you don't think his behaviour is acceptable? Do you think it's O.K. that on a premiere night he randomly runs off with some vamp? Well, I realize it's not the best decision. But it's not all that bad. I say as Hjalmar Söderberg: "I believe in the desires of the flesh, and the incurable loneliness of the soul." Oh, I hate it all. I loathe it. That's why people call us theatre rabble. And they're right. Yes... That a man is unfaithful to his wife after 26 years of marriage, never occurs in other professions... It's not only that. It's all wrong. Is it a life we're leading? Are we a family? Or are we a bunch of egoistical, self-centered, empty individuals who run in and out of a so-called home, which in reality is a guesthouse. Pay attention to your voice projection! What are our interests? Theatre. What are we thinking about? Theatre. What are we speaking about? Theatre. What are we dreaming about at night? Theatre. And I hate that word. This is not a life. We live like shadows in a world of make-believe. And if we ever are human and genuine it's between 8 and 11 in the evening, when we're performing at the theatre. Not bad. But cut out that bit about shadows in a world of make-believe. It reeks of bad literature. Have a laugh, but I mean every word I'm saying. Now I know what I want. Göran told me tonight that he wants to marry me, if I quit the theatre. Tomorrow I'll say yes. Quit the theatre? What'll mum and dad say? I don't care. I want to become a genuine person who lives a genuine life. No one can stop me. I want a home that is a home, and not just a place to sleep and eat. I want a man who's interested in me, and not just roles and reviews. And I want to give birth to a child that I'll have time to nurture. for something other than theatre... Magnificent exit line. Taxi... A taxi to Hedingatan 43, please. Swedje. Thanks. Gosh. You haven't gone to bed? I wanted to speak to you about something, dad. How were the reviews? Fantastic! Excellent! Well, they have heard better and more beautiful voices than mine. But it's will suffice - we won't have the change the schedules this season. Well, what did you want to talk about? A girl? No. I want to quit the theatre. Well now. Of course a bit part in an operetta isn't much fun. We can take care of it. That's not what I meant. I want to quit completely. I don't want to be an actor. What are you saying? Are you serious? Yes. I don't think I'm good enough. No. Yes, by all means, I might become a decent actor in 10 to 15 years. But if you're the son of Stefan Anker, decent won't cut it. Besides, it's not easy being the son of a great actor. Listen, I was that too, and it went quite well, no? I wasn't very happy at your age, I'll tell you. In spite of that, you never considered becoming anything other than an actor. No, of course I didn't. But I do... What are you considering? Journalist. What? You know I've always liked writing. Harry has seen a few pieces and says they're not bad - I've got a job offer at the paper. My son... A newspaper hack... That's a job too. It wouldn't be easy being a theatre director without journalists. Well... You do as you wish, of course. I'm not going to stop you. But consider... that we - the "Ank's" - have been in theatre for five generations. Your grandfather's father performed with Emily Högkvist. You're planning to break the chain. Whereupon the curtain rises before the third act. Daddy, it won't help being melodramatic. I know what I want. I hope so. And I hope you succeed. Let's go to bed. Newspaper hack. I'm planning to move out too. Oh? Why? However it is, it'll be a change of scenery. Well, I see. Stefan! Did mother call? I didn't hear it. Stefan! Give me the papers. It was her. Good night. Good night, dad. You see... What reviews! Splendid. Not a single unfriendly word in any paper. Where have you been? We've been so worried. Two large columns on the front page. And it keeps on inside the paper. Yes, but where have you been? Have you heard the news? What? Tommy is quitting the theatre. Become a journalist. And leave home. You can't mean that. Yes. Well... I've always known that this day would come. Must come... But I couldn't imagine the six of us not sticking together. I'm worried that Monica is leaving too. You're not saying she's planning to marry that Wallsenius lad? I won't say a word. The children fly out of the nest. But we... We two have got each other, at least. That's the most important thing, no? Of course. Of course, my love. Good night. Good night, darling. My dear little girl... when today you... leave us; your family. and your profession... and enter life, in order to... How the hell does it continue? "In order to start a life of your own with Göran..." Is that what it says? Yes. "Enter life in order to start a life of one's own..." Too much life. It doesn't work. I hate giving speeches! If I could understand why she's getting married... to that bore. Mille, where are my medals? I don't know, director. Aren't they in the case? If so, I wouldn't have asked. Betty? Yes? I ask, where are my medals? Aren't they in the... No, they're not in the case! When did you have them last? At the opening of Stadsteatern. You've of course forgotten them during the journey. Forgotten? Do I forget things? Dad must have them. He's put them on. Dad, let me ask you this... There they are! What? - My medals. - Your medals? You haven't got the White Rose. You're right... As a matter of fact, why haven't I got it? I've got St. Olav and the Order of the Lion, but not the White Rose. I'll have that as a condition for my next guest performance. Well, hear that... I hope you'll be well- behaved tonight, Karl-Hugo. And don't curse while speaking with the vicar. I don't use swearwords. You do! Me? Only when I'm angry. You cursed! Stay still, Karl-Hugo. We're in a hurry! How does mum think I look? Wonderful. You're the prettiest bride I've ever seen. Oh, mum. It feels so strange. I'm so happy. Even if it's hard to leave you. How do you think I feel? Dear mum, don't cry. No. One can't live in this house anymore. Isn't there a single person who knows where my... What's this? Are you crying? The girl's getting married. It's nothing to cry about. It's fun! You don't understand this, dad. I don't understand. Let me tell you, but I understand enough to know that the bride and her mother can't come to church crying. Your entrance must be worthy of Stefan Anker. By the way, I cannot go. I have no medals. Perhaps they're in the writing desk in the office. Why in God's name would they be... Now I know! In the overcoat pocket! Stop crying! Come, daddy. Yes, yes. - Which side? - The left. Oh, fine. No, wait. When I married your mother, I was on this side, she on the right. But you're not the bridegroom this time! - Left! - Yes, it doesn't matter. Let's start on the same foot. - Why isn't the music starting? - It starts when we enter. I won't go one step until the music starts, I tell you. It doesn't start until we enter, and all are waiting. How do I look? Good! How's the hair? Dad, I'm the star this time. Yes. Remember what I said. Straight. And don't smile. It'll only be forced. And look divine! Dad, this isn't theatre. I look how I feel. How many times must I tell you that one must never base one's performance in a true emotion, and think that right. Dear God. One must employ knowledge and technique! One must know what one is doing. Dad, I'm not going to an audition at Dramaten. I'm getting married! Left foot forward? - Yes. My dear child. Are you happy? Are you sure this is right? You don't know him well. I love him and that's the main matter. I wish you all the best, blessed child Dad, we mustn't start crying. I'm not crying. Ready to enter? Open the door. Left foot forward. Straight and confident. - Welcome home, darling. - The same goes to you. Göran, I'm so happy. To think that this is our home, where we'll live, year after year, and sit together in peace in the evenings. You read the evening newspapers. I serve coffee. And light the fireplace. Darling, I'm so happy you exist and that you convinced me of becoming an ordinary housewife. You're not worried that you'll regret it? No, absolutely not. What did you think of my colleagues? I thought they seemed nice. But conversing with them was a bit difficult. One of them didn't even know the difference between tonnes and register tonnes. How terrible! What's the difference? You must know what a tonne is. 1000 kg. Correct! Stay seated. It's a weight unit while register tonne is a volume unit. I assume you know what is meant by 'volume'? Isn't that what Archimedes invented? Don't bring him into this. Volume is the same as quantity of space. Then I'm a little volume. - What? - Yes. Because the space contains me. I don't give damn about your old registration tonnes. 'Register tonnes'! I don't give a damn about about your register tonnes. Cheers! 1 register tonne equals 100 English cubic feet. Several of which equal a Swedish one. No, Monica, you mustn't joke. You must learn a bit about my profession - it'll provide our income. Life will be a dance on English cubic feet. You're impossible. And newly wed. Give me a kiss. Hello. What? Oh blast! Of course they had to do it tonight! Yes, of course. Don't wait. I'll come myself. In a quarter. Damned war! They've laid out a new mine field. Darling, I'm mortified, but I've got to go to the shipyard to redirect the ships. Otherwise there might be an accident. Can't someone else do it? It's not that easy. I've got the responsibility. Darling, I think it's just as bad as you do. I'll be as swift as possible. ...and this notice concerning the 50th 'Helena'. Make sure they don't remove the caption. And please add a photo of old Anker. Of course, editor. Say, editor, one couldn't get a ticket, by any chance? I can try to fix that. - Thank you, editor. - Thank you, too. It's Anker, the editor. It's Anker. If anything happens, I'll be at my parent's house in the next few hours. Have you heard anything about my article on Saroyan as dramatist? It'll be in next week's paper, yes? So Colliander has written a similar one? Ah. Please make sure I get mine back. The paper bins are full anyway. No. I want to act again! I'm not planning on withering away here, just because your bloody 'Helena' is a success. Dear grandma, you wouldn't want to rattle about on a train day after day Especially at your age. Don't be silly. I like trains. I'd very much rather spend every day on a train than sit at home all alone every night with nothing to do. Grandma is addicted to acting! That might be so. But if you've acted almost every night for 55 years you can't suddenly do without it. I won't stop willingly until the Lord claims me. - That won't happen soon, mom. - You never know. But I want to do this part before he takes me. It's an excellent part for Betty too, by the way. What do you think dad and grandpa'll say? They can say whatever they want. It's their own fault. And we won't become dependant on them being in an operetta! Yes? Hello, darling. Hello. You don't need to stay up waiting for us tonight. I'll be late. Oh? Why? There are lots of people waiting... Very important matters, you see... Well... And... Dad is going to the annual party at the tennis club. He forgot to mention it to mum. Yes, inform her of it as gently as possible. Yes, do that. Of course. Good night, darling. Try not to be too late. Remember to get enough sleep. Good night, darling. Is he not coming home? No, unfortunately. Lots of people were waiting for him. I can't understand why he can't do his work at daytime like other people. Grandpa's a third-place finisher in doubles. Fancy that. He's skilled. Very much so. There were three teams in the competition... I wonder what the prize is. He'd collect it tonight. Prize? Tonight? What do you mean? They're holding the annual party with an award ceremony tonight. Hasn't he mentioned it? What a buffoon! So that's why he put on the dark blue suit. Of course one must wear a dark blue suit if one's going to drink punch! One mustn't mock one's grandpa! It didn't sound like him anyway. And he isn't drinking punch! No, he's never done that. - I must go. Good night, mum. - Good night, darling. Good night, grandma. And... Drop those plans about the tour. Never! If Karl-Hugo's out collecting prizes in the night, I'll show him! If he snores, he'll sleep on the couch in the hall. I'm not lying awake sleepless just because he's so skilled at 'lubbing', as he calls it. 'Lobbing', mum. Well, it doesn't matter. 'Lobbing, lubbing'. Yes... Let's see... 50 times 1200 is 60000. Not bad. You've earned that much on 'Helena'? Yes, indeed! I forget the most important thing... Here go are. On the occasion of the anniversary. Good evening. Is editor Lundberg here? No, but your father's sitting in the grand hall. Stefan... I can't accept it. I don't want to. Don't be silly. It represents 5% of the surplus. You're worth far more. You're paid too little. From tomorrow on you'll get twice as much. At least! Stefan, you're too generous - not suited to be a theatre director! Certainly! I loathe people who are frugal and greedy. If one earns money, one must use them too! Here you are. Thank you. Good evening. May I speak with dad for a moment? Yes, of course. Excuse me. One moment. What do you want? So miss Swedje is the important meeting? Tommy, I don't pry into your private life. There's a difference! I don't have a wife and two children to care for. Do you have problems with this? Not me, but mum! If dad's so very interested in miss Swedje, you could at least handle it better. I say precisely what I think. As a man, I understand that such situations can arise. But it's unnecessary to let the whole city know about it. What you two get up to privately is one thing, but that dad's in restaurants handing out rings... Mum's too good for that! - What did he want? - It was nothing. Stefan, I don't like this. People are gossiping about us I don't want that. For your sake. Let the hyenas talk. They must live too, no? They'll talk however one lives one's life. Did you hear the poet Wildenvey's advice to those who wish to avoid slander? [Speaks in Norwegian] "Do not walk in the street". "Do not sit at home", "Avoid men", "Run from women". "Never be alone". It's me. You weren't sleeping? I thought about your idea for a tour. It's not that silly after all. No, not particularly... I thought it's be nice for you. Good night, mum. Good night. "Charlotta and Betty Anker begin their own tour." Enter. Hello. Gosh. What are you doing here? I'd nothing to do, so I thought I'd look how you were doing. Take a seat. It's not pretty, but it's uncomfortable. That's my predecessor. So this is how a journalist lives. If you'd said 'advertisement writer' you'd be closer to the truth. You sound slightly bitter. The young editor had a slightly bitter mind. - Do you want coffee? - Yes, please. Tommy, what's this? Are you not happy? Not quite. It's worst at the start, I assume. One thinks there'll be lots to do. Four-columned reports and signed feature articles. What do I write? Notices. The older lads to all the fun parts. But I'll get more chances. And you - how are you doing? How long must one wait to become an uncle? - Seven months, I believe. - Is that so? Monica, how lovely. Does mum know? I'm waiting for her to call, about the premiere tonight. They'll be delighted. Premiere... It's been a while... Only a few months. - It feels like years. - Well, listen to you. It sounded suspicious when you said the word 'premiere'. You haven't started missing that hated concept 'theatre'? No. Absolutely not. I'm doing great. I'm thriving. That's good. Where's Göran tonight? He's in a meeting. Meetings after 2 and a half months of marriage! Such fun! I know what you and Hjalmar Söderberg are thinking. But this time your conclusions are too quick. Hello. Yes, miss. Hello. Good evening, mum. How are you? How did it go? A success? 3 applauses after the first act, and 6 after the last one. How wonderful! And the governor remained standing until the end? Fantastic! There's a young girl here who wants to speak with you. The honour is mine, mum. Very good, thanks. The news, the news! Mum, I wanted to ask you something. Would you mind a new task in early November? Yes. To become a grandmother! Oh, Monica! You can't mean that! Oh, my dear, dear child. What is it? I'm so happy. What is it? She's becoming a grandmother! Me, that is... Hello, miss. We can't speak more, it seems. Take care, darling! Grandma is hugging you. Goodbye, mum. Embrace her from me! They were pleased. Let's respectfully give a damn about the advertisement, and go out for a champagne. It's on me! Yes, thanks. Have you got money? Yes, how so? Good, I've only got a tenner. Last performance of "Fair Helena". In ten days, we premiere in Göteborg. If the weather's not too good, we can stay there all summer. It doesn't matter. We'll have a holiday anyway. Know what I've done? No, I don't. Rented a sailboat. What do you think? Have you ever sailed the Göteborg coastline? No. It's fantastic. Wonderful! You and I, and a sailboat. Sun, sky and sea. It sounds like the words from a bad hit tune. Darling, we can't keep on like this. - What do you mean? - You must understand. If we weren't famous... but people are talking a lot - it's not good for you. Let the ladies talk. The day they stop talking, I tell you, it's all over. And don't think they won't go see us perform just because they're outraged. But I don't want them to be. - You must choose, Stefan. - Choose what? Either we break up, or you must divorce. Divorce... That's the only right thing to do in this situation. Both for my and you family's sake. Sonja, I... I can't be without you. You know that. I love you more than anything. We belong together, you and I. Both as artists and as humans. Darling, that's how I feel too. But if you really mean it, you must divorce. There's no other option, Stefan. I'm being serious. Stefan, hurry up and pack! The trains leaves in an hour. I'm not going, dad. What are you saying? Not going? But Betty and mum have been looking forward to seeing you. You mustn't disappoint them this way. Dad, I'm in a damned difficult situation. Do you see what it concerns? Yes, but I didn't think it was that bad. You're not considering divorce? There's no other option. For God's sake, Stefan. Consider your actions! Betty's at least got... Yes, dad, I know. I've considered it a thousand times. I know we've been married for 26 years. I know we have two children together. I know that we share a lot... Memories, friends, habits. But it doesn't matter. I love Sonja, you see. I think I love her in a way I've never loved before. Dear Stefan. Don't you think I've been in your situation? Yes... All husbands experience this during their lifetime. But do you think I regret staying with your mother? No. But it was difficult to get over it. But one does. If one wants to. I'm not so sure. What's worse, I don't want to. I don't want to get over it. Betty and I have shared many years. We no longer need each other. She'll do fine without me. Tommy and Monica are old enough to take care of themselves. Old enough to understand me. I hope. So nothing can convince you that you're making your life's greatest mistake? Nothing, dad. I know what I want. Would you do me a favour? Yes. What is it? Speak to Betty. Tell her how it is. I'm not a coward who wants to avoid unpleasantries, but you could do it better than I. You'd also make it easier for her. You ask much of me, my boy, but of course I will help you. I just hope you won't regret this... When did you say the train will arrive? 16:48. They'll be here any minute. I wonder if he's slimmer. He hasn't gone to bed before 2 or 3 a single night, of course. Oh, it'll be good to see them again. I wonder if Stefan has considered renting a villa outside Göteborg. Probably not. But it always works out. It'll be nice to get to the west coast. Relax a bit with Stefan. Enter. Well, here I am. Good evening, my little sweetheart. How have you been? Oh, thank you. Look at you. You're slimmer. No, I've gained 2 kg. It's the punch. Welcome, dad. Where's Stefan. Well... Betty dear, he didn't come along. - He didn't come along? - No. Betty... I don't know how to say this. What is it, dad? What is it, Karl-Hugo? - Is Stefan ill? - No. What is it? God help me... I'll tell it as it is. Stefan wants to... get a divorce. What are you saying? - Stefan wants a divorce? - Yes. - It's not true. - Yes. I'm afraid it can't be changed. I tried speaking to him, but... Dear Betty... Why should this happen? Hello, mum. Welcome. Hello, my child. Let me look at you. One doesn't notice it! I think you've fooled us! Oh, you'll see it soon enough. A drink before dinner? No thanks. Well... Everything's in order and ready. All papers signed. I came from the lawyer just now. Have you still not spoken to each other? - No. It's better that way. But I received a lovely letter from him. 8 pages! I hope she's good to him. He believes so much in her, and she means so much to him. I very much hope she'll make him happy. You're wonderful, mum. No, not at all. But I love him. Therefore I hope she can give him everything that I couldn't. He's worth that, you see. I'm not sure if I agree. Monica... Don't look at him with bitterness. Neither you nor Tommy. If I can avoid it, surely you'll be able to. It's easy to condemn, darling. It's not as easy to form a balanced opinion. One decide one's emotions. And please remember, dad's not an ordinary person. He's an artist. An ingenious artist. We shouldn't wish him to be like others. A call for the lady. It's the director. Thanks, Vera. Excuse me. Hello. I won't be home for dinner tonight. I'm very sorry, but you'll have to do without me. Important matters, you see. Göran, can't you change it? It's grandma and grandpa's first visit. Can't it wait until tomorrow? Listen to me, I can't! Don't bicker. Oh, fine, it can't be changed. Bye. Göran says hi. He's very sorry, but he can't come to dinner. So, tell me, have you made plans for the summer yet? Monica... I hate to pry into others' private lives. But you're my daughter. Be honest with me, are you really happy? Well, happy... Not only happy - I'm content. Is that true, Monica? Oh, mum. I'm miserable. I don't know what to do. I've made a great mistake. It's not solely Göran's fault, it's equally my own. We don't fit together. We're not speaking the same language. I tried to fit into his life. To take an interest in his boats, to get along with his friends. I can't! It's wrong, all of it. And now we're having a child together! My little girl. Why must life at times be so difficult? It'll work out. It always does, somehow. What? The paper'd like to know what colour I prefer for men's underwear? Well, little miss. Men's underpants should be dusty pink. Made of charmeuse. With linings on the sides and with Vadstena lace. What strange things they ask one! They called from Stockholm just to ask! What's your opinion of the photo of us two? Fresh and unconventional, right? Yes, it's definitely unconventional. Aren't you tired? No. The opposite! I feel like a new and better better person thanks to her. Calm and happy. At least 10 years younger. Take the trey, please. I'm bursting with energy and desire to work. Next season! What a season it will be! That's why I came - to speak to you about that. There are only a few months until it starts. We must discuss employments and agree on the schedule. What should be first? A sensation, lad. The most original play that's ever been performed on a stage. Or rather: in a ring. A ring? Are you planning on becoming a ringmaster? Well, yes. But it's not only circus. It's circus, it's drama, it's opera. It's farce, operetta, revue. All in one show! Interesting. How will it be performed? Is it a play, or...? It's a play and it's not a play. What do I know? The author is a chap named Stridström, who came here. A complete idiot. But here he's a genius! The story takes place in a ring, during a performance. And the artists perform not only their acts, but they're also the characters in a drama! Enter. One of them's an animal trainer, who I... Could I get a signature? No, there's no question... Now I'm angry! Give me the receptionist at once! I'm trying to make a call! Are you crazy? There's a million schoolgirls in my messy room! Quiet! I'm speaking! If you don't remove these children, I'll go mad! What do you want? They're bundling up in my bed! There are other hotels in Götaborg! I'm going... Dear sweet girls, leave! I don't want to sign! I won't do it! Go away! I signed a promissory note once, and I had to pay it myself! This is crazy... Where were we? The circus people... Right. Well... Their intrigues, their fates get intertwined, when... Get out! What's the matter? I'm going mad... This damned popularity is killing me! Where were we? Oh, yes... They get intertwined like this. No one can get them apart. And the storyline... The storyline will be told to the audience while the artists are performing and so on... by voices... Excuse me. Voices? Will they be hearing voices? Of course. So the audience will know what they're thinking. While they're performing their acts. Isn't it great? Isn't it ingenious? I think it sounds stupid. And expensive! Expensive? Not at all. No, I'll play all male parts myself. It'll work - they're never on the stage simultaneously. I'll do a magician, a musical clown, a lion tamer... - Lion tamer? - Don't worry, they are sea lions! And a hairy monkey! Good Lord... "Stefan Anker as a monkey." "Kungsteatern opens with a Swedish original play." "Ingenious, says Stefan." He's gone mad. Completely mad. "Does all the male parts himself." "Sonja Swedje sings in trapeze." "The stage is extended in the shape of a ring into the hall." - Maybe it'll be good. - Good? It'll be the greatest fiasco in Swedish theatre history. Wait and see. But it's for the best. Someone need to knock him down to earth. The gentry are soon finished. Thank you. Have you heard anything about the dress rehearsal last night? Last night? They were done 11 this morning. Ernst called a while ago - he was crying. Dad's unstoppable. He hasn't slept for two nights. It's sold out, at least. Yes, unfortunately. The fewer people who see it, the better. Tommy, do we have to go see it? You know how dad'll react if he doesn't see us in the box. Thank God that mum, grandma and grandad avoid it. If they'd been beside him, the premiere'd never have happened. - Hi, Tommy. - Hi. I believe a tonic is in order. The situation calls for it! Why isn't Tommy calling? It's over half past 11. Perhaps it wasn't only ingenious - it's long too. Perhaps the sea lions have forgotten their lines. Hello? It's me. Yes. Oh? What? It can't be... What about dad? You can't mean that. Tommy, how horrible! Of course. I understand. Yes. Goodbye. A great fiasco. A terrible play. It wasn't a play at all, actually. Stefan was tired and desperate. Lots of people left before the ending. It was a scandal, more or less. As I said... Calm down, Betty dear. It's doesn't matter much. Poor Stefan! How will he handle this? If only we were still together... Why did we have to go straight home, just because it went badly? I put on a tux and everything. I think I'll use the opportunity to speak to Brodin about revamping Vega. Go ahead. I don't want to. Won't you be sad? No. Hurry up so you'll be there before closing time. Yes. Goodbye. You haven't printed Colliander's review yet, have you? No, it's over there. - Thank you. Good. He'd like to edit it. He was in a hurry, so he asked me to do it. Hi. I'm sorry about the grief. What are you doing? Are you changing offices? I'm quitting. I was just going to Wadner to resign. What? Hello? Damn! - What is it? - He was there before me. I'll explain later. Yes? Good morning, dr. Wadner. Before dr. Wadner fires me, I wish to resign. I completely understand how reckless my actions tonight were. I've nothing to offer in my defense. What are you talking about? What have you been doing tonight? Has Colliander not spoken with dr. Wadner? No. How so? Speak! I cut some lines in his review of dad's premiere last night. I told the printers it was on Colliander's orders. Well, that's not exactly good. But the edited review was scathing enough! Much more severe than the other papers. Well... I should give you a proper scolding. An fire you straight away. But I'm not going to do that. You've broken the laws obeyed by every honourable journalist. You seem to understand that. The paper may need you. I therefore let mercy outweigh law this time. Let's forget the whole story. I've read your article on Saroyan. It's good. Very good. But it's not in the paper. Good that dr. Wadner thinks so. I'm introducing a new column. It'll consider contemporary literature once a week, in a fresh way. You'll write it. Thank you, dr. Wadner. I'm both grateful and flattered, but... I want to resign anyway. Oh? Why? I've found that blood is thicker than water. I thought I could do without theatre. But I can't. It's my home. Also, my father needs me now. Do as you wish, of course. But if you regret it, you'll be welcome to return - Thanks, dr. Wadner. - Thank you. Good day. - Good evening. - Good evening, director. How is it? Not particularly good. I see. How many have we sold? Between 500 and 600. A few reservations too. But few are collected. Don't sell more tickets. Hi. We'll cancel tonight's show. Cancel? We haven't a penny to waste, Stefan. 'In the Ring' has run for the last time. I'll put on a new play next week. Dear Stefan, it's impossible! For God's sake, don't make matters worse than they are! It's not possible to put on a new show in one week. Of course it is. If one wants, one can do it. Do you remember a play performed at Djurgårdsteatern 20 years ago? 'Galosches of Luck'. Good play. Ran for a whole summer. A success. We're putting it on. I know every word of it. But the others, Stefan... They'll won't be able to do it. The play is old anyway. It doesn't matter. It's a good part for me. That's what's important. Get copies and actors tonight. We'll have rehearsals tomorrow at 10. Let me make this list. Make sure all staff stay. But Stefan, there are no possibilities of... Do as I say! Don't fuss! Out! They're saying it's cancelled. Is it true? Sit down for a moment. I'm finished soon. I need to talk to you. Of course. Go ahead. I'm done soon. I signed a contract today. Oh? What contract? With Hollywood. Oh? Hollywood... Hollywood? Yes. The negotiations have been going on for some time. I didn't want to worry you before it was certain. The contract arrived today. And you signed it? Without speaking with me? It just happened that way. Stefan, don't be angry with me. You must see what an opportunity it is. And you and I have made no contract. When are you leaving? As soon as there is a place ready. My visa is ready. I don't want to see you ever again. Leave! Stefan... Leave! - But Stefan... - Leave! Before I'm forced to tell you who you are. I'd rather not. If you think this is a nice way of saying goodbye, by all means... But be careful not to imagine that you are as great and wonderful as you believe yourself to be. Farewell Stefan. How is it? Not very good. We've done our best with free tickets, but one can't force people to come. Poor dad. He looked so tired and bitter. I hope she'll fail in Hollywood. A devout wish... Göran didn't dare come, I see. No, he had to go to Göteborg. to take care of his beloved Vega. It's a ship. How do you think it'll go? Well, he's too old for the part. and God knows he's got no farcical cheer to rely on right now. He doesn't know the script well. Tommy, where will it end? Who knows. It looks bad. What is it? Nothing. It'll over quickly. We should keep the traditions of a theatre family going. But to give birth to the next Anker in the box is to take it too far. Can't we leave? It's nothing. It's over now. I won't be giving birth a month too early... They're staring. Good morning. One copy, please. Yes. Here you are. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well? Oh, not that bad. Say it as it is. Another fiasco, no? I'm afraid so, dad. Just read it. It doesn't matter. I want to hear it. What does it say about me? Just read it. Stefan Anker once said in an interview that he sometimes needs to rest his talents. He did it last spring as an original and charming Pâris. He did it last week in the mad 'In the Ring'. Last night he did it in one of the successful roles of his youth, the traveling salesman in 'Galosches of Luck'. He should've gotten his repose by now. Not more than a year ago, Stefan Anker was the great shimmering name of Swedish theatre... That's enough, thank you. Drive to Strandvegen 118. Good night. How about a nice steak in the kitchen? No, I'm not hungry. I'd like to sit an talk for a while. Thanks, but I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Go home. I'll call you tomorrow. Good night. Good night, dad. "O that this too too solid flesh would melt," "Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!" "Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd" "His canon 'gainst self-slaughter!" "O God!" "O God!" "How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable" "Seem to me all the uses of this world!" "Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden" "That grows to seed;" "things rank and gross in nature" "Possess it merely That it should come to this!" Here's the bag, Mrs. Isn't he coming soon, Vera? The editor'll be here soon. Does it hurt? They didn't say at the office when husband'd be back? - No. He went to the docks at 4. A test drive... He couldn't be reached by phone. The editor's here. - Hello, Vera. - Hello, editor. - How are you, Monica? - Thanks. Let me help you. - Thanks. Let me help you. Take the bag. I didn't want to bother you tonight, premiere and all. - I wanted someone familiar to come along. - It's fine. This is more important than Hamlet. - How is dad? - Fantastic. Excellent. He's getting his redress. How's it going? How can you ask? People are ecstatic! You've never been better! The worst's yet to come. Where did Tommy go? He sat in the box, before the drapes were lifted. Suddenly he'd gone. If it's me you're asking for; I'm here. Where did you go? I got a call. Now listen. What? Has anything happened? You look pale. Is it Monica? She's been taken to the hospital. She's not in danger. One always gets a little upset. You're lying. What's the matter with Monica? You must tell the truth! What's the matter with Monica? It's critical, but everything can still be fine. Of course it will be fine! - Get a car ready at once! - Yes, director. For God's sake, Stefan! - You're not going to leave? - Yes, I do. We've got 20 minutes before the middle act. I've got time. I'll be back soon. Dear dad! Think about Hamlet! Think about how much it means! I've got a daughter who might be dying! That means more! Dad... Dad, we must go back. More than a quarter has passed. You heard me. I'm not leaving before I have news. Good God in heaven, let everything be fine! Don't punish me so harshly! Well? How is it? The birth is over. The child has died. And her? We don't know yet. We're doing everything in our power. We must go back. Dad. You're performing Hamlet! It's the premiere! Yes... I'm playing Hamlet. Dear dad. Don't react this way. Think of the stakes. Dear dad, you must! I can't manage it. I can't! I don't want to do this anymore. My dear little girl. Dad... Nurse! A doctor at once! Dad, dear dad. We must do something. Some of the audience have already left. Do... What the devil can I do? Why the hell isn't he coming back? Well? - He's left the hospital. - Thank God. He collapsed. A doctor took care of him. What? The audience is trampling. We must do something. What shall I say? Blame an illness. - Illness? - Indeed. Irresponsibility, I'd say! Well, there's nothing else to do. - He's here. - What? - He came just now. - Thank God. To the stage! Mille! What do you say? - Does the doctor think dad can do this? - I don't know. He gave him as much as I dared. It may work, but I doubt it. Daddy, perhaps you should let it be. You may not manage. I want to manage! I will manage! One can't betray the audience who have paid their tickets. Drapes! Wait a second! Let dad get a moment to calm down. They can't wait any longer. It's already a scandal! Drapes! How do you know? Scandal! You don't know what's happened! How dare you criticize my actions? I do! An actor who betrays his audience and his cast, in favour of private interests is no actor! An actor who does that... Have I... Dad! Dad. Enter stage! Oh, so you've come. What are you doing here? I assume you won't be interested to hear that you got a child last night. What are you saying? It was stillborn. Monica almost died too. How frightful. Indeed. You handled it better than my father. His Hamlet premiere got cancelled. He was taken to a psychiatric hospital. I'm damned sad, Tommy. I hope the boat was satisfactory. - Good morning, mr. Anker. - Good morning, nurse. - How's dad today? - As usual. - Not better, then? - No. Unfortunately. He sits and stares straight ahead. He neither wants to read or to speak with anyone. - Good morning, dad. - Good morning. How are you feeling? Thank you... Monica sends her greetings. She can leave hospital soon. She's much better. Really? That's good. The rest of the family send their greetings too. They're gadding around in the country, and are doing just fine. I know. I just received a letter from mum. It made me happy. - Always be kind to her, Tommy. - Of course. Don't hurt her as much as I've done You wouldn't be able to... Dad always exaggerates. Mum was wise. She understood dad. Yes, I know. But that doesn't excuse my actions. There's no defense... You once said to me that I should be more considerate. I'm afraid I've never been so to anybody, in my whole life... No. I have been a complete egoist, who only has taken, without giving back. As your son, I must protest. Remember what you've given the audience! You've never saved yourself rather than give the audience your best performance. Apropos the audience... When'll the next premiere be? Spider webs are clustering in Kungsteatern, and Ernst is looking worried. I know what I've said. There'll be no more premieres for me. I've played my last part. Dad... It's not worth trying to convince me. How will you get an income, daddy? Old seafarers who suddenly leave their ship and go ashore, they... usually don't live much longer. Dad, don't say that! You're not even old. Yes, very old. And very tired. Get well soon. - Rolf You don't need to look so sad and guilty, Göran. You can't help that we don't fit together. It's equally my fault. Say what you want, Monica. I know I've neglected you, and rather focused on my job. Don't you want to give me a chance to make good? a chance to make good? No, Göran. You need another kind of girl. If I ever marry again, it'll be a very different man. One I can make happy. I'm a theatre child, you see, and we're so limited. You must come and speak to him. I've tried, but he won't listen. He's impossible and apathetic. He doesn't want to act anymore. If he doesn't act, he'll die. He's getting there. It's horrible to watch him. Mum, you're the only one who can help him. He might not want to see me. Mummy dearest, he loves you. If you're near Stockholm, go and see him. We're at Eskilstuna on the 17th. Call me first - we'll go together. Mum, promise me you'll do that. Of course, Tommy. If I can do it, you know I will. I love him. Isn't the weather beautiful today, director Anker? Yes. A little sun is nice now and again. We're not used to it at this time of year. It's Christmas soon! Yes... Christmas... My birthday... It would've been an anniversary too... What anniversary? It's nothing. I'm was dreaming of how things could have been. Do you want a book? No thank you, nurse. Anniversary... Visitors for director Anker. Stefan, my darling. Can you forgive me? I know it's a banal line, but... I've got no other. "Premiere on the occasion of Stefan Anker's 50th anniversary." "Sold out!" Mille, do I look good? Wonderful, director! Do I look too young? I should be about 60. It's delightful, director. Good. Are there many flowers? Oh yes, and more are coming in. - How many would you guess? - About 30 bouquets. Mille's mad. Usually, one must die to get that many. - It's the last call. - Yes. Good Lord. Hi, boys. Let me have a look. Good. Don't forget the pause I mentioned. Keep the military attitude in mind. Let me look at you. What's this? Is that supposed to be a modern Stockholm journalist? You said I should change... Within limits! I didn't say you'd be a cross between old Jörgen and August Stringberg. Remove these, trim that too, under the eyes. Remember the hands, the hands! And turn in the middle of the closing line... I thought this'd be fine. How are you doing? Let me see. Sweet as a troll. You've put too much blue on your eyelids. Remember, don't cry in the scene with me. You won't know what you're doing. I loathe people crying on stage. - How are you doing here? - Good. Dad, that beard is far better. Don't forget that point we discussed. So you're teaching me how to act? Listen, I'm the director! - I don't dare say anything about mum. - Don't you dare! There goes the director! And me! Let me look at you, darling. Your hair is much better that way. You look 5 years younger. 10! Betty, hurry, for God's sake! The king's here already! Go on and make us proud! Oh, let it go well. Nervous? You ask! I'm an actor. You tried to deny that once. Dear Stefan, I didn't then know... Let's not speak about it. If you knew... how grateful I am for everything I've been through. I needed it. I thought I was great, that I was complete. Complete - one will never be so in this profession. The curtain is up, director Anker. Yes, I'm coming. The most important thing is to find oneself. And I think I have. Subtitles by DeQuincey. Proofread by knappen & knutten.
