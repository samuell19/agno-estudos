The Brutalisation of Franz Blum Blum... Franz. 28 years old, born in Berlin. Convicted of robbery Five years for bank robbery. 11 months in remand custody. One in-house penalty. You wouldn't name your accomplices. The court says you drove the getaway car. Your employer, an insurance firm, was happy with you. You had very good career prospects. You've jeopardised your own future. You matriculated from a good family. That's irrelevant here, of course. Everyone is equal here. You must try to understand why your action was wrong. We'll give you every chance but you must work at it. They're your problems you'll have to work out. We can't look inside you. Not even by force. Zig Zag, what are you doing? I'm noting down the new arrivals. Hey neighbour. What's wrong with you? Do you mean me? What's all the noise for? I've got a migraine. They won't give me any pills. These attacks really break you apart. I haven't had one for five years. Five years! It makes you go to pieces. Thank you! Hey, look at this. We will always meet again in this world. I arrived a week after you. (....) You can help me out cleaning. It will be good for you, believe me. - Why? - To be out of your cell. Just for a couple of minutes. You will get no money but bonus points. - Bonus points? - Yes, good behavior points on your file. You do want probation, right? Why bonus points? If someone do a work for the community without getting something in return, is trying to be a better person, to regret his action. Isn't it? - Come on! - Yes, yes, yes! It's enough! Exercise! I told him but he doesn't believe it. Hey you, wait. My name is Marie. You're new here. I saw you once before. I really like your chain. Want to swap it? Here. Men's perfume. You'll get one more bottle next time. - Where's Marie? - I'm not a snitch. Such a popular young lady. Marie, you tart! What a jealous guy. Clear out! Clear out! Freedom's calling! Check this. - What's that? - Palms, beach and ocean. Show me. Come with me to Hawaii. In Hawaii there's no beer, that's why we prefer to stay here. Hey you. You're educated. The doc won't recognise my paralysis. I'm fit for jail until my head drops off. I know. You've been trying for years, I can't help you. Twit! Look at that lunatic. He still owes me coffee. I gave him cloth for a snazzy pair of overalls. Twit! Don't pull that one with me! This man is sick. He was defenceless. What's going on? Come on. Let me through. Hey, whats the idea? Now wait a minute. Go and get a stretcher. Keep his head low. - Did you see it? - Yes. - Who did it? - Him over there! Kuul.... Kuul, come over here. Don't put up with that jerk. Tell me Kuul... Did you beat up Bielich? I have no business with that twit. Blum? He meant no harm. He was feeling faint... and he just bashed him up! Careful, my lad. Lying is punishable. That guy saw it too! You don't know what I do or don't see. Ask the warder what he saw. I saw something going on. But I'm not really sure what it was. - There you are! - Criminal! Don't say that. It hurts my feelings. If they lay charges I'll bump you off. That's enough now. Come on, beat it! Beilich...You'll press charges, won't you? No. Very well. Then we'll lay charges. Blum, I'll count on you. Of course I'm afraid of that thug. That's why you don't press charges? No. Well. Why don't you? You come here and talk. Don't you know Kuul? Anything at all about him? Why? He's had ten years training as a thug in this place. Do you know what he did before he got here? Don't listen to his drivel. Bielich... Didn't kill a teacher, he murdered a child. Yes, a child. Don't you listen to him. His sentence was reduced because he's nuts. Come on, Blum. Come over here. It's more comfortable. Beautiful. Oh heavens. You're a great cleaner. Bloody tart! Come back to your cell and don't fool around with that wanker. Well? Do you have shit in your ears? Quiet! Kuul, go back in your cell. Carry on, men! Blum, that swine. I'll bury him one day. - Hello, Mr Kopf. - Hello. You must be careful. He'll go off his brain soon. You'd better withdraw your statement. It's our model factory. Not just anybody gets in. Well then. I'll see you tomorrow. You just have to sign the statement. What about Kuul? I've explained it to you. If you sign that Kuul has made threats against you, we'll have a hold on him. No, you needn't be afraid. You'll manage it. What did you do outside? - I was studying. - Studying what? Is it true what Marie's been saying? - It's not true - What makes you say it? There was a time when I talked to them. To explain their situation to them. But terrible things began to happen. Brawling, denunciations and so on. They were tearing each other apart. Jail destroys them. The less they could say about me, the more they hated me. Borsig, the cripple, made up that child story. And someone denounced me to the superintendent. I got four months solitary confinement. Do you know what that means? No conversation, no people. Nothing. - And now? - Now back to work, Blum. You'd rather do other things. But skill and energy will bring results. Take me for example, Blum. I could work anywhere. But my commitment lies in the social field. Wallner, will you finish this today? No, I don't think so. Well, Wallner? What did you earn last month? You're my best man. Cut it out. 40 bickies. 40 bickies. There you are! Isn't that something, Blum? 40 bickies! Hey. Watch it. - How long were you in for? - 12 years. Eight more to go. My name is Dr Sternich, I am doctor. I've seen this recently with Kuul. That's a bad story. I mean... For us is the living here a double penalty. You're new here, but you know... If I'm honest, you make all errors at one time. Why? Bielich for example, although of the education he should be closer to us... It is a very horrifying appearance and... can work like having poison on you. - What do you mean? - No, no... You are a likeable man, Blum. The pastor mentioned you recently. Why don't you move to my cell? My cell is in a different wing, I already spoke to Mr Engelweich. I mean... the thing with this "Tiger Kuul"... You are... very strong but... no one knows about the jealousy inside him. I'm telling you, he fell. Yes. Like the autumn leaves. No idea. Surely you remember... the time I told you I wouldn't forget. And now I'm paying you back. A statement by Blum that you assaulted him! And a further statement that you threatened him! You'll be transferred. To another wing. Alone! I don't know if you're interested. They're poems. Not really great ones of course. But maybe... Maybe you'll like them a bit. Here's in this... darkness. Did you find another one? How long have you been here? He's here for poaching. A cavalier with his rifle astride his steed. He hunted Jews and took their lives. Shot them down from his horse. Outrageous! Outrageous! It's mealtime! Give me one more sausage. That's enough. Want some custard? Old people don't need more. - Mealtime! - Hello. - Here you are. - Thanks. Hello. - Here. - No mustard? Custard! Custard! Blum! Wait! Here. I no longer need it. Prisoners mustn't trade among themselves. They can't give or accept gifts. Clear? Come on, back to your cell. Get going! Carry on! To move Kuul out won't be that easy. They went over our heads again, didn't they? I'm not going in there alone. One moment! Please don't look, honey. Cut out your bloody ''honey'' or I'll whack you one. Let me do it. For me? Bugger me dead. This isn't off the peg. I'll have to press it again. It's the right length too. To our fifth anniversary from Zig Zag and me. Help! Help! Help! Blum! Help! Orderly! Orderly! Walter, you look... You don't look like a prisoner. - I've got to shit. - Shit? No way! Not on our 5th anniversary. - Not in front of the cake. - Quiet! What's up? Bielich must've hung himself. Bielich! You're insane! You're going to take me to Supervisor Engelweich. I'll walk behind you. If you make a false move or alert anyone, I'll kill you. Bielich... I'm taking the prisoner Bielich to the supervisor Engelweich. Bielich? I haven't been told. Yes, he has to see Engelweich. Immediately. - Did you ask for Bielich? - Not me. But he was in the security section. Yes. Have him searched properly. - Stay where you are. - Jesus, Bielich! Don't be silly. Give me that gun. You and Dr. Weiss are through scheming against me. You'll take me to the clinic. I demand a cardiac examination. Come on, Bielich. You could have lodged a request. My requests have been met with growing cynicism. Don't talk nonsense Give me the weapon. I promise that we'll look into your case. This... This and your pension are all you care about. Weapons found in C-Wing! Yes! Have everything searched! Search all the cells. Come on. Against the wall! Hey, cleaner! Walter must leave the cell. They want to separate us. I'll go. Hey, what's up? How about inviting Blum to your farewell? - Hand him in to us. - Oh, honey. Don't call me honey! Hey Blum, listen. You could give me a hand. - Where? - Over there. You can help me lift a heavy crate. Come on. It's too heavy for me. Come on. It won't take long. Come on. You're invited to our party. It's a pity there's no more cake. But we can have fun anyway. - Please, don't Walter! - Let me out! Come, give me a blow job. You bastard! Perverted swine! Come on, finish him. Quiet! Listen to me! Our efforts to convince the department... to issue guidelines for regular special leave, have been sabotaged by recent incidents here. Special regulations and visits are suspended... until further notice. You're also to blame for all the... internal transfer of jail inmates. You can thank those who are responsible. Here, you bastards! Fire for you! Keep your electricity! You and your bloody promises! You bloody bastards! Bastards! Swine! Shit! I won't put up with this for long. They'll keep doing what they want. I'll piss off at the next opportunity. To Brazil. - I have an uncle there. - I know all about him! Are you pissing in your bed? What? Borsig, quick! Get an orderly! - Blum's cut himself. - So what? Orderly! - Orderly! Come here! - Shut up! Orderly! Borsig, get up! He's gonna cark it! Orderly! Orderly! Where are... my glasses? - My glasses... -Go and look for them. One month in this place and he's still tongue-tied. Let's try it once more. Tell him, Romano. You can work with us, you'll do well. We only take the best. I'll stay solo. Your decision. Come on, go by side. Oh, now you must lick the soap from my ass. - Come on, turn it on. - Too late, your time is over. Come on, do it. Turn it on! Are you insane! - I'm sorry. - Don't dare you to do it again! Let themselves bashing. Why haven't you done it earlier? Beautiful chain. May I have a look? Of course. Really a beautiful chain. I have been looking for one for my wife. I'm sure this one costs 200. My wife is crazy for this stuff, you know? You wanted to see me? Oh, yes. - Your visit permission. - I don't need it. You have nobody? A wife? A slut? Well... (...) By the way, the gipsy. You got the wrong one. Between us... the worst is Rosato. Rosato? Yes. Oh well. You must be now very careful. - What's wrong there? - I'm coming. - 21. - That's impossible! Can I get my tobacco now? - Where is my tobacco? - Shut up! Two... Dead. I only wanted my tobacco. - What are you? - A qualified baker. Qualified baker. Is that possible? What are you? A prisoner. What are you really, baker? - A sex offender. - More specific! - Children fucker! - Correct. You're a child fucker and sex offender. - For you, if you dance. - I can't dance. - Go on, dance! -I can't dance! You can't dance? Is that possible? So you'd rather fuck your bread rolls? - Yes, he can dance a song. - He can dance, and how! Come on, let the Smart child fucker dance! Romano, we need music. We can't set out in this weather. I won't! Bloody jerks. - We'll strike. - We can't go in this rain. To them rain means a hurricane. Toughen up, mate. Must you loll against the wall? Well, lads? What's up? Gambling and drinking tea all night? No, wanking! If you touch us I'll sock you one. - I can handle you. - Why don't you try? - What's going on here? - Lumbago. Kidney pain. - And you? - Diarrhea. He'll make us tea and mashed potatoes. Wupke! Get the men moving. Forward march! Get a move on! Get moving! You'll get your arse wet today. Get a move on you deadshits! Wake up, Fuchs! Ten meters are compulsory. Blattmann. Hey, Blattmann! How much did you manage? - Zilch. - What do you mean "zilch"? - I work for the bosses. - Bosses? You mean Rosato Manienta and Co. Exactly. - But they're in the camp. - Eating mashed potatoes. Let me alone! Hey. What's up? Where am I? In jail. Can you spare some tobacco? That's good. I've been meaning to ask you. Should I work for you? How do you mean? Well... Most of the guys are working for someone. I've been meaning to ask you... but I didn't know if you could pay. Some tea? Please. - What's happening? - Lemon? Sugar? What's this? My butler. His butler? - Well... - Cheers! So... You both have two guys working for you. Two guys! That's nothing. Last month Blattmann changed from you to him. Rosato's guys went to hospital. - What's it to you? - Let's join forces. We could have ten guys. Then the peat factory would be dependent on us. - It already is. - But we'd have more clout. I mean... We could demand more. We'll block the work... unless they supply is with schnapps. - Then we'd buy the others. - It won't work. That will never work. He's worse than we are. I think I was wrong about you. Enjoy it! Can't you put a bit more!? - What is it, Blum? - I must talk to you. Why? - About Rosato. - What about him? I don't trust him. I mean... Because of the chain. What's it got to do with me? Could you look after it for me? All right. Your fiancee might like it. I'm open for offers. Rosato, did you watch Blum? He's been talking to Sporl. These three guys will work for you. Tell us how much you offer. One half for you, the other for the jail... until we fill our shopping quota. - One packet for five meters? - Exactly. But I don't smoke, I want schnapps. - The tobacco in advance? - In advance. What does that mean? I need it! - If I sell myself... - In two days. Schnapps in three days. People change. Don't you need any help? Go on, get lost. Mr Wupke. What's the top speed of your car? Yes, yes... How much horse power does it have? Keep rubbing it then. Rosato wants to get one over you. He saw that you took the chain. He's making noises about it. No, I can't do it. 20 packets and you're rid of him. Or lose your job. I'll fix him in another way. 20 packets? Yes! Come on, and faster! Now through the bend. More speed! Tomaso! Blum! Three packets for the whole month! This can't be possible! I've heard... People can work for you? Fuchs! - Prisoner Kuul. - Hut 4. You've a new friend. From now on you'll learn to eat shit. - Hut 4! - Hello Kuul. Why did they let you out? Cigar? Well? - Aren't you happy? - I'm through with you. I don't know if you'll like Blum without his teeth. What's that? - You're on my seat. - What? Says Kuul... 30 meters. Blum, 30. Ten metres for Kuul. I'm sorry, Blum. Ten meters for Kuul. Kuul? Do you all work for Kuul? Ten meters for myself. I'm self-employed. You'll have to do 30 meters by yourself. Unfortunately I have already written it down. - Are you crazy? - Return the tobacco! Get it back from Kuul. I've got to talk to you. Get down! Give it back. I want 20 packs of tobacco and your sedative. The sedative right now, I know you have it. - What for? - I haven't slept for two nights. No way. It's too strong. Prescription only! Give it to me or I'll turn you in. - Turn me in? - ''Warden accepts chain!'' And Rosato saw you taking it. You're a real bastard. - I'll pay you back. - Don't forget the tobacco. Come on, hurry up. They're so stingy with the goodies. I'm feeling sick Kuul, you want mine? Hand it over! - Did you spit in it? - I just got it. Get lost. Are you crazy? Kuul! Hey, Kuul! Leave him! Stop it! Who else wants his arse busted? Come on Marie, go for it. Hey, watch it. (...) I don't think so, but the proper. - Do I bother? - Yes. Do you know the news? They want to start a sport club in the institution. A sport club? To self-control it, the prisoners will do it by themselves. Self-control? That's bullshit. Yes, with reunions, elections, managing director... and even a vice-director. I don't believe in motto. You haven't job perfomance in the book. That means for us: Lazy, lazy, lazy. You can't demand that I falsify the reports. Lazy? 10 meters every day. Do you know what that means to me? We call it (...). Blum is the one who is lying in the sun! You know it perfectly! You are smart, you had to consider it before. Be happy that you haven't got a notification for refusing to work. So... now you know the notice. You'll come back tomorrow with Kuul in the Institution. I insist that we bring Blum. We have nothing against him. He makes business and let the others do his work. - Everybody know it. - But he cares for calm. Men. Listen! The work inspector just came by. Your quota's been increased to 12 metres. Stop kicking up a stink! The company can't survive with your output. They'll be forced to use machines. This is your last chance. Now get cracking. Back to work! Mutineers will be shot! Mr. Wupke, there's a fire! Is your hot-rod busted? You bastards! Get buckets and water! - My car's on fire! - Put it out yourself! We'll have to push it! Isn't there anyone around who's got a hose? There's fire, there's fire... There's a fire in the town... Isn't there anyone around - ...who's got a hose? - No! Yes, there we have our lovely Wupke... Everybody back to their quarters! Hurry up! Everybody back to their quarters! Hurry up! Stop it! Do you hear me? Stop it! One... two... three... four... five six... seven... Hurry! Get going! Come on! To your quarters! Come on, come on! Get inside! Don't think we believe the fire was an accident. Inside! You'll all go back to jail! Come on. Is everyone inside? Where did you come from? Get inside! Come on! It's the first sports club we've had here. The firs ever experiment of this kind. This is a chance for all of you. A chance you should make use of. First we'll elect the committee. Nominations please. Then we'll have a ballot for five men to represent you. Please. Beck's flat-footed Schutting! Stop. Silence. One moment please. Not everyone at once. We need some order. All right. One at a time. Please. You'll stay out of this! Talk! I've mentioned our concern to him. Staff shortage, the danger to discipline and authority. Do you know what he said? That he'd be prepared to supervise the sport in his spare time. - How about that? - Sounds good. But we'll end up doing it. We'll notify the press at the first slip-up. The ministry will be behind us. Unlikely! You smart alecs want to see a mutiny among those so-called club members? Right. A moment! The elected members are: Schütting Blum Beck Rosato and Buffe. Buffe just ahead of Kuul but we can only have five. I think that's it. Let's go back to the cells. May I say something? You've elected me as committee member. Thank you for your trust. So the five of us will set the statutes. I think its the most important... to ensure the rights of all members. I'll do my best to support those interests. The club must serve you and not you serve the club. A great speech. You said that very well. You voted for Blum, Marie saw it all. - Come on, talk! - I wasn't the only one. Your interest is too high, 50%. Pay back the coffee within three days... or I'll break your crutch and your cripple legs! What's going on? Well, Blum. We were lucky, weren't we? Congratulations. What did Kuul want? He noticed that I'd voted for you. I must pay back the coffee in three days. 200 grams. Half way through the month! I beg you... - ...or he'll kill me. -I'm no longer doing that. Ask Goh. Go on, take it! Well? 25 percent as usual. Drop the interest this time. 200 grams. 200. Here. Thanks. Go on! Didn't you hear, my lad? All yours. Go for it. Dummy. He's a dummy! A dummy? A club president needs a clean slate. Goh will run the business from now on. The interest will stay as before. Clearly, its been worth it. Once I'm president, we'll expand to C-wing and recoup our losses. We'll start selling schnapps and make ten times as much. Kuul does business... and we do business. And if the two clash... I want to be consulted. Got that? Pull the chain! Come on! Pull the chain! The statues must be surefire. Clause one: Playing sport is a privilege. If we don't want someone we'll bar him. - And the warders? - None of their business. That's self-administration! So approved members must be grateful! - Clause two: Dues. - They'll have to pay? They'll respect the club once it has money. We'll buy the equipment with it. Like ping-pong tables. Everyone plays ping-pong. But some will get priority. You mean the informers, thugs and profiteers? God! It makes prison look tame. Stop waffling, I need penal rules. - What? Penal rules? - Very broad ones. Wearing gym shoes outside sport is banned. Other shoes give you blisters. The committee won't see everything! But there could be a case... where a guy doesn't pay his interest, and is wearing gym shoes. Then we'll expel him legally. He means that the committee is the club, and that we are the committee. And we'll be sitting pretty. I got it for you. I got the coffee for you. Take it. You've been waiting for it. What are you doing? Everything's hunky-dory now. You turd! I've got the feeling you're avoiding me. I don't like to bustle about. - Still the lone wolf? - If you like. But you're quite busy. Sometimes you've got to have a go, or you'll go under. Do you mean me? Maybe. Do you have to convince me or yourself? - Maybe both of us. - Save yourself the trouble. How's your heart? The doctor won't refer me. They think I'm malingering. Do they give you anything? Give medication to a malingerer? - What do you need? - Isoptin. I've got my connections. Yes, so I've heard. By the way... I still owe you one. Me? Don't you remember? The pills when I had a migraine. One the point of dues... All inmates are entitled to pay sport for free. But the money will benefit them. It's for buying sports equipment. Sport is absolutely vital for us. We must make all the sacrifices. Exactly. People must prove their commitment. If they can buy tobacco, they can afford 50 pfennigs. - Not everyone has tobacco! - They've got 50 pfennigs. - Not everyone's working! - Is that our problem? That's up to the work administration. You'd really like to swallow this club. Six years! For six years I've looked after our sport. Did I do anything wrong? Come on, tell me! I always tried to please everyone! Now you're talking big... You'll leave one day. But I'll stay! For life! Blum, what brings you here? - Visiting again? - Are you back at work? I don't think so. Hello, Marie. How's your love life? - Back with Kuul? - Don't waste your words, we have nothing to talk about. I've come to tell you the good news. I talked to the supervisor about a job in the library. I said you'd more time as club treasurer. He agreed immediately. It's great, isn't it? You can stop this crap and read all you like. Why are you doing this? What do you want from me? Nothing. I thought we were friends. Friends? Hello, friends. Hello, Tiger. Cough up the levy. Today is payday. Of course, your tobacco. I've got it in my cell. You'll get it now. Listen, Blum. You've been very distant of late. But I'm very happy about the reduced interest rate. We old ones can't earn that much. Blum, back to your cell! I shouldn't tell you but I'd do anything for coffee. - Then get me a cardiac drug. - Are you ill? - It's for Bielich. - What? How... - The drug's Isoptin. - Well, that's... - ...very difficult. - Impossible? - I wouldn't say that. - There you are! Excuse me. If you need anything you'll get it from me! Sure, Tiger. What do I have to do with others? - Right! - Hey you! You need to do something about your prices. - What do you mean? - Blum's cheaper. Idiot, you think cheap is cheap. I tell you, cheap and cheap are not the same. You'll see. You'll thank me for this! If everyone acts out of pure selfishness, its everyone for himself. And who are the victims? The powerless. Who's in favour of the statutes? Thanks for the excellent statutes. They bring order to this chaos. All that's missing is the death penalty. Shut up if you can't take this seriously. So, the statutes have been approved. I'd like to thank Schutting. for his dedicated service to our sport. Thank you... He'll be thanking his maker for being able to speak. At last you've realised. You're a medical orderly. You'd make a good president. - But why not Schutting? - He might find out things. What could he find out? About your escape plans. What gives you that idea? You'll need cash on the outside. I could help you out with that. - You could be president. - If you think so. We can't trust Rosato with the accounts. - What accounts? - Accountability reports. Every week. No, you'd better do that. Accounts...No! Buffe? No! We can't have such a peasant in the position. Schutting would approve of anyone. Except you. Well, fancy that! Isn't he a real muck-raker? You'll get all the votes. One small things concerns me. The inmates won't like it if you vote for yourself. No. I wouldn't vote for myself. I could cast my vote for you. That's a good idea. My big boss, Goh... sent me to ask if you're still a Kuul guy. If you want to buy cheaper at 25 per cent. No, I don't smoke. Right, you're on the booze. Or do you want schnapps? Cut it out, I want no trouble with Kuul. But who's Kuul? Who's Kuul? Come on, you're a man. Hey! Can't you Kuul... Attend to our business instead of the cake! You can see how its getting worse. We're just no match for Kuul. I've had enough. Kuul nearly broke my back. - So what? - So what? So what! I've seen more newcomers than I can count. I've never had any hassle! Until you came with your ideas... But you always send others. You're too much of a coward. - I'm out! - No one's getting out! Then work out how to handle Kuul! That's how it is. Tell the cripple to write the letter like I told him. Exactly as I told him, understand? Exactly! Marie, if you don't see me tomorrow, I'll be either dead or free. There's no turning back this time. I can't be worried about other people. Especially not that scum, the warders, who've been the curse of my entire life. If everything works out I'll send money via S. You know who I mean. Loving you always, Tiger. - Who's Tiger? - Well, Tiger... That's Kuul. He's the only one with a tiger tattoo on his chest. - Where did you get this? - Well, its like this... I mend prisoner's clothing. And I found it in Marie's... In Tomaso's coat pocket. Put me on to Supervisor Engelweich. Superintendent? I have a request. Maybe you could grant me an extra visit... by my wife and children. Hello? Kuul wants to escape. He'll put up resistance. He might be armed. Yes, I'll wait. You have a family? Kuul! Come with us. Why? Ask the superintendent. - Him of all people? - Come on Kuul. What are you doing? Kuul... Don't wreck your own future. You see, Kuul? Like this, you're quite approachable. You want to complain? What will that achieve? You think you can rough me up for no reason? Nobody's in here without a reason. We have proof. You wanted to escape. Escape? You can't be serious! You bloody jerk! You know what goes on here. You know who's behind this! - Who? - Blum! Blum? - Do you have proof? - Proof! When I get out I'll kill all of you bastards. And now the ballot result. All five votes for Blum. Congratulations, Blum. - Thank you - Congratulations. One moment. This is my treat. I scrimped and saved for it. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Go on, Schutting! - Cheers! - Cheers! To our sports club! Come on, come on! I've been watching you. It's working out great. The way things stand, you'll get an extra hour a week. - Put the interest up to 50. - 50 per cent? Sure. What else? - I got it. - What? Your heart medication, Isoptin! Here. You see? Unreal, isn't it? You thought I was crazy for trying. Amazing. You're doing this for free? Just like that? You know... I have the feeling I need you. Don't you mind living well at others' expense? How else will you get your pills? Your attempts have failed. First Kuul. Now who'll you get rid of? - What's that? - You're more dangerous than Kuul. Your methods are as cynical as the system's. - Why don't you do the same? - Exactly. I'll report you to the prosecutor... for inciting violent assault, extortion, coercion and so on. And I'll submit a report to parliament. That would expose plenty around here. Are you kidding me? Are you sick or something? Here. I don't want it. Why don't you tell everyone, brave guy? - When? Where? In my cell? - At the next sport session. I'll make sure you can talk to everyone. Due to our disciplined sports sessions... we'll get an extra hour on Sundays. Hang on. One moment. Spare a few minutes. Bielich would like to talk to you. Not more blather! - It'll all come off our sport. - Shut up! - Don't tell us a fairytale! - Shit. You're cheering Blum. You don't see that he uses you for his own ends. He's only using the sports club to improve his trade... in coffee, schnapps and tobacco. Why don't you, smart-arse? -Don't you see? This club's just a smart way of keeping you in order. And by one of your own! He's more dangerous than the officials he plots with. - Shut up, professor! - Are you so helpless? You get punished twice and pay for it. The club's only another form of punishment. You're treated as pariahs or animals. - You can't even see it! - Don't call us animals! Don't you realise that... you're being very cleverly disciplined. Don't you see? -What do you want, weirdo? You're... -Are you having us on? By endorsing your punishment you're worse than your judges. The club's your punishment battalion. But you don't realise it! You're lost! I'm not afraid of you. Not any more! 1000m run! Come on guys! Run! Faster! More speed! And now this way! Come on! Faster! Come on! Come on, breathe. The little heart's beating. Breathe in and out. - The heart's got to pump. - Come on, go on. Don't get tired now. Breathe! Faster! Bielich was right! That's why you killed him! He was right and we destroyed him. - And it's your fault Blum! - Have you gone mad? You incited us! Murderer! Murderers! All murderers! Don't stand about. Get inside! Come on! Everyone back to your block! See to it that they get back inside. Move! - What's wrong with him? - He's gone. It was just too much for me. You must understand, Blum. I don't know why I acted like that. In jail for too long. My nerves have had it. The long jail term totally stuffs you up. I did offer him the heart medication. Blum to the superintendant! I feel sorry for you about Bielich. I know you've been rather close. But these things happen. Heart attack. Well, Blum. We're pleased to inform you you're being released early. Because of good conduct. Pack your things and get ready. It's been four years now. A long time. But we believe you're a changed person now.
