Where are you? Mom, where are you? Right in front of you, Lita. Okay, come on. Here we are, camping at our favorite spot in the desert. Blow me a kiss. Come on, you guys too. Lita... Hey Lita, those are the good ones. Are you getting this? You spin first. And then we both spin. Lita... Is it robot yet? She's connecting the transistor right now. Look dad, there's his brain. Is it supposed to do that? Lita... How cute is that? Gosh... Where are you, mom? Lita... Did Nannie and I ever... tell you about the Eros Comet? In ten years, I need you to promise me... ...that you'll take the family to see it, honey. Dad, listen to me. We have to get our family back together, okay? - Just let me take Nannie to the-- - There is no more family, Lita! Leave your grandmother alone and stop calling me! But tonight we're supposed to go-- Lita! If you let me go now, I promise I won't tell dad. Oh my...! He has a saw now? Pilaf, you ready to do this? Lita... Let me out you motherf-- ! Today's your day mothers. Please report to the banquet hall with your families. How does it feel to finally be wearing that badge? Oh man, you know. My mom's been showing it off more than anyone. Damn it. Happy Mother's Day, pretty lady! Diane! Where have you been? Aww... I'm sorry, mom. We need a little dance. You and I. Come on, mom. Show me your moves. What are you doing? Where's Diane? I told you to stay in bed! Damn it, Rosie. - Have you guys seen Lita lately? - It's been a couple weeks... Pilaf. Hack his walkie. Security, report to the south wing immediately! Where is she? She's dead! I told you a hundred times she's dead! What are you doing? Your father said you're not allowed in here, Lita. Well he's an idiot. And I better not see you again. Hey Nannie... Shh. Come here. It's okay. Do you know where she is, sweetie? It's okay... I'm here now, okay, pretty lady? I'm gonna take you somewhere special tonight. Okay? Diane! I knew you were here. No... It's me, Nannie. It's me, Lita. Oh sweetie. Let's get out of here. Don't screw this up again, Teddy. Come on Lita, last time. Back away. You and your mom can take a hike, Teddy. I'm tired of you and everyone telling me what to do. If my mom was here, she would raise hell if she knew that we were separated. So unless you're gonna help me, I suggest that you back away. Somebody get gangster Barbie. What the-- ? Yee-ha! You can't do this, Lita! Bring her back! Duck! Sorry Lita, but it looks like you lost. Sayonar-- ahhh! Help me! What are you standing around for? Go get the car! Sweetheart! Where are we going? Crazy! You remember what tonight is... Bingo? We promised mom we'd go see the Eros Comet tonight. Don't you remember? Oh. Yeah... Anyway... I am taking all of us back to the old camping spot tonight. As a family. So we... we have more friends, sweetie? You could say that. Hey, slow down! What was that? Nothing... The house is a mess... - Dad, open the door! - Oh, geez... - Dad! - Give it up, Lita! He doesn't want to be with us. Especially you. Yeah, let me walk away from him and Nannie like you did. I'm sure that'd make mom real proud. Yeah, no, I just know when to quit. Okay, look around. Is this a family? No, it's a lost cause. Okay? Live your own life. Get a boyfriend. I'm sure you'll meet someone nice in prison. We cast away our burdens to Him. And we will join Him with our loved ones in Paradise. Amen. For the last time, stay away from me! Dad, please come with us! - We're supposed to go to the desert. - I don't need to be around an atheist. You still have a family. Stop praying your life away. What does it matter to you what I do with my life? According to you it's all for nothing. Isn't that right? Life isn't about Heaven, dad. It's about now. And we should be spending time together now while we're still here. Don't you remember what tonight is? If there's no Heaven, Lita... ...then where is she now? I don't... I don't know. Please. Dad... We'll make our own miracles, won't we? Where are you, Diane? Just give me a sign. Please. Anything. Mom would be disgusted with you. Ditching us and then hoping some God'll solve everything? Oh she's goin' to Hell. You know... I think it's been 50 years, sweetie. Since what? Since you planted those flowers in the backyard. Remember how they glowed when we found them? Who am I, pretty lady? You're Di-- Stop quizzing me, honey, I... I don't appreciate it. Don't you remember all the camping trips we did together? Or the church picnics? Don't you remember me? I don't know, okay? You don't think I know I'm confused, sweetie? I'm sorry, Nannie... That little you-know-what is gonna get it. Little thief. Mom, don't you mean "kidnapper?" Keep it up, Teddy. Maybe you should go teach English. Now man up! Lita, do you want to go to jail? Back off, jackass! My dad gave me permission to take her! No I didn't! Hold on. Pilaf! Woah, God! You little cheap-ass Samsung! Damn. Not this time, little girl. - Just drive, mom. - Oh! Watch the road! All this for a stupid camping trip? I'll get you now. Oh my God! I bet you're dyin' for a chocolate malt. Remember all the times we used to stop by here? We're going in, alright? Let's try to be a family for one night. I can't believe this is happening. This is not Rosie. I don't know who this is. You still have a family who loves you, Nannie. What family? Come on, Nannie. Let's sit down. Great job, Lita. ♪ Happy Mother's Day to you! ♪ Cut it out. Rosie! Rosie! Stop! Oh you stop. Let her do what she wants! There you go again telling me what to do. Well maybe I wouldn't have to if you did the right thing in the first place. Like what? Like taking us to see the comet? I never promised that. Yeah, I hadn't even heard about this comet until today. Well shows how much you people remember. Or maybe you're just making it up. Wouldn't be the first time you're scheming something that-- Oh my God! Where on Earth have you folks been? Oh, we've been tied up... Rosie, sweetie, how're you doing? There's a robot under the table. You gonna go on the floor and dance with Diane? You kids-- no one could dance better than Rosie and your mom. Excuse me. I'm just... Uh well, you know I, uh... I'll just go get y'all some malts. Yeah, thanks, Trish. Why did you leave me, mom? What do I do? I'm right here, Lita... Where are you? You know what you're doing, sweetheart. Where are you? Take him to the comet, honey. Remember to take him... Hey, Lita. Lita. Lita. Dance with me, Lita. Pilaf, Pilaf! Hey Lita! Lita! Lita! Rosie and Diane! I mean... Rosie and Lita. Teddy, what's going on in there? Teddy! Why is the cop here? Umm... Lita... I need you to come with me. Get over here! No! Lita! Pilaf, stop! Quite frankly, it's embarassing that you got this far. But you're not going to threaten my son's job again. You understand? Marsha! Well well well... If it isn't the sergeant himself? I hope you don't think you're above the law here. Just promise me you'll take them to see the comet. I don't know why... But mom really wanted us to see it, okay? Hey! Let's go. Come on, honey. Hey! Oh shot, we're gonna get shit! Oh stop being such a baby, Kit! You leave them alone! Get off me! You are all accessories to a felony! Teddy! Hon, it's Mother's Day. Come on, mom. Thank you, everyone! You're digging yourself into a deeper hole! Well good. Maybe I'll find gold. You were right, mom. She was a thief. Oh, is she okay? - Alright, ready? - Okay! - Count to three. - Okay. One. Two. Three. Are you kidding me? I'm done! I'm done. Nicely done. What's wrong? The last time we were here... She told me her cancer had come back. She tried to keep it a secret. I didn't know what to do... And I left you guys here. I just got in the truck. Drove off... I'd forgotten that. Then the next week she was in the hospital again. And in and out, in and out... God knows how many times? You're my good boy. And I'd ruined that last night we all had together! She would've given you permission to be happy, dad. No... I doubt she forgave me, honey. Not after that. Hey! Nannie, where are you going? I remember... Going with Diane when she was little... Over that way. Nannie, there's nothing out there. It's where the ceremony is. What? Lita, dad! She's leaving! Come on, dad. No... Lita, please. Dad. It's okay. I really don't want to be here. I'm sorry... Lita. Dad, look. Woah. Hey, what's-- what's going on? Is this pollen? Where's it coming from? Look closely. They're mom's flowers. They're the "Stars of Eros." Mommy... ...where did daddy go? Why did he leave? Kids... Did Nannie and I ever... tell you the legend of the Eros Comet? No. Well, it's a very old desert legend. When humanity was young... A celestial maiden fell from the stars and... became friends with everyone who lived in this land. She was well-known for cultivating flowers, which had the power to brighten anyone's day. She even married and she had two little kids. But one day... The woman was called back to the heavens against her will... And forced to leave... everyone she loved behind. So that she could remind her loved ones that she was still alive... ...she would return to this land every 50 years... to awaken the "Stars of Eros." When the comet returns in ten years, I need you to promise me... that you'll bring your dad to see it. Won't you be here, mommy? Lita, I will always be with you... ...as long as you remember me. Sometimes, you'll hear my voice comforting you. Other times, you'll share the love I taught you. And that's because I'll always be... Right here. Right now... ...living inside of you. Mom... So do you promise to bring him? I promise, mommy. Good. Because I think he will love it. She did forgive you. Happy Mother's Day, dad.
