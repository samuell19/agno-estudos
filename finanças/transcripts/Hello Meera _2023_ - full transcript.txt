(Sanskrit shloka) What is this? I have already told you. Not to stitch like this. It doesn't look good in the photographs. Once listen to me Madam.. -Not anymore. You've finished the blouse of the first-night before to other important ones. When the most important ones are for the wedding ceremony? First you stop the song. I will wait Till all my blouses are done with necessary alterations. Plese don't take trouble madam. I will send them at once when they're done. No need, Thanks. I'll wait here. Otherwise you'll make excuses until the last minute of my wedding. Okay Madam, Please be seated. Now play the song. Yes mom.. -Where are you? Actually, I do not want this wedding. So I am leaving to Hyderabad. What? Is that a joke? Then whatâ€™s the matter with you mother? I already told you that I need to visit the tailor. Do you think I'll just run away in the mean time? I know that you are at the tailor. All I am asking is how long will it take? It is getting dark dear. Oh my god, in this dark, wilderness. Being a lonely girlâ€¦ Will I make it to home? Stop kidding.. you still at the tailor? Until the wedding is nearing What should I do? It took me this much time to set everything properly. I'm behind this tailor much more than Kalyan behind me. That is why, you should always do all your works in advance. This is Vijayawada dear, not Hyderabad. I have told you not to address my son-in-law by his name. You cannot decide on how I should address him. We will figure out things ourselves. Sister, we need the grinding stone for tomorrow. Where is that? See, Aunt needs a grinding/crushing stone. May be to crush the uncleâ€™s face. You are going overboard See they are in the yard Anyway stop this non sense and Just let me know when you will be home. Am coming right away.. I'll start quickly, when you hang up. Okay, be quick and safe, donâ€™t stop in between. Nope, I'll visit the Babai hotel on the way.. to eat the Guntur idly. and then I will come home. I'll kill you. Okay mom, hang up. Kalyan is calling me, I will call you back. Hello Would be husband... -Hello... would be wife in 48 hours Hi baby... You wished me good morning. Then there is no call or message after that? You can't ignore me like that. I've just collected the dresses from the tailor and I'm going back home. Hey, are you still at the tailor? You men cannot understand our ladies problems. All you need is one shirt and trousers And you are good to go. Even I thought so.. But you have done my shopping And complicated my wedding dresses. Okay, keep talking till I get to home, Your sarcasm helps a lot to deal with my frustration. Hey are you driving and talking? Is that what you have understood? Great! No, I'm not driving But I am about to start Anyway, I am on bluetooth call baby Meera, you know me. I cannot stand talking over the phone while driving. Fine. Then go ahead and hang up, I will start. Baby, you are my life. Keeping my life secure is my responsibility Really? Are you laughing when I am being romantic? I'm sorry baby.. You suddenly sounded like that insurance advertisement guy. Yeah, you are psycho. Turning the romance into cheap comedy. Okay, okay.. I get it Baby. Okay, drive safe. And go slow. Otherwise, you may end up hitting someone like before. Okay I love you baby. No. I love you more... Say this after ten years, then I will accept it. My love on you will remain the same and come what may, it will never change. Really? I promise I don't believe in promises. Because promises are meant to be broken Just hang up. I'll deal with you after our wedding. Bye my darling. Bye. Hello, I am still here in front of your store. What happened? Did I forget anything?

Police station? Meera, do you know Sudheer? Hello, Meera! Are you in the call? Yes sir. Are you hearing me? -I'm listening, tell me. Do you know anyone by name Sudheer? Yes sir, why? It is an emergency. You need to report to Raidurg Police station immediately. Me? To police station? Yes. -Now? Why should I come sir? As I told you its an emergency.. Sir, you need to tell me at least what has happened Without knowing anything, how can I turn up? I'm currently in Vijaywada. And you are asking me to come now. -Thatâ€™s not my problem. There is a issue about Sudheer's suicide case Sir, am not able to hear you. Tell me, hello.. Hello sir. Shit! Not now. Hello Kalyan. What happened, you sound dull. Nothing like that.. Am just little tensed. Tensed?? Why? What happened? Is everything Okay? No.. no... stitching... tailor... matching It is all about bridal stuff. Baby!

Hey, my mother wants to talk to you about something. Okay, I will call aunty in a while. Oh dear, she is not aunty to you. She already told you to call her "mother-in-law". Okay dear, I will call her like that only. I am really busy now. I will call and talk to her. Okay. Meera! Baby... just one second... Just one question please... What? What should I wear for Sangeeth? Armani or Manyavar? Even if you are there in boxers, it will be fine for me. Okay. And I love you... -I love you too. Oh, yes, tell me. Why are you shouting at me. Donâ€™t irritate me and let me know the matter. Mom said to bring two kilos of gram flour while returning home. Can't you go and get it? I am into some-other work. Can I know your important work? Sister, while I was lighting the house.. There has been a short circuit. So I came to electrical store to buy a fuse. Fineâ€¦ I will get it. Hello... -Hello... Sir, your voice was not clear earlier.. Call got disconnected. I could not understand what you were saying. Can you please tell me now You know Sudheer right? Yes sir. Ok Meera... I think I've a bad news Sudheer attempted a suicide. What? -Yes. We shifted him to the hospital. And he's... -Dead? No.. no.. no. His situation is very critical. But sound like you are waiting for news like that Oh my God! No... no.. No Sir. But, how is the suicide related to me? Why should I come? As per the current situations, we have many doubts. Especially about you. Because he mentioned your name in capitals, in the suicide note. What? Hello! Hello Meera! Hello! Hello! Sir! So wherever you are, you should report at the Raidurg police station immediately. Othewise, I will have to inform the Vijayawada Police to arrest you. How can you arrest me? Just because my name is written. I already told you. Not just the name. We need to figure out many things in the enquiry. So, it will be good if you come by yourself. Sir, please sir.. I am really clueless about all this. It has been two years since I spoke to him. Day after tomorrow is my wedding sir. If my parents or in laws get to know about this.. My life will be spoiled. Please sir. I'm sorry Meera. You have no other choice, you must come here. I had a lovely evening with my love Happy forever. Happy 4th anniversary baby What the hell is this? Hello Meera, Did you see it? Sakshi.. What is this? Even I could not understand anything. I slept after the night shift I saw it when I got up. And I've gone bonkers. It's been two years since I met him. How can he post as we celebrated our anniversary yesterday?. If Kalyan or anyone in his family gets to see this.. What is going to happen. Yeah, thatâ€™s true. Meera, now lets not worry about why. Instead, lets think about what can be done. What we can do.. I already got a call from Raidurg police station. SI asked me to start immediately. What the hell? Why? And at this hour? Sudheer tried to commit suicide. And above all, he had written my name in the suicide note. How can he post something like this and attempt a suicide? I have no clue. I think I'll know more only if I get there. But before that we have to take down this post. Yah! You are right. Call to our friends and ask them to report about this post. If ten or more reports it, then it'll be deleted. Super idea... you don't worry I'll take care of it So, Are you starting to Hyderabad? No idea. -Whatever it is.. just update me. Okay? Okay Take care, bye. Yes mom, Where are you? Your grandmother and my mother are yelling at me. for sending you alone at this hour. You never listen to me. Do you? Brother could have got all those stuff. I'm coming right away. I had a small work from office They needed me in an online meeting. So I parked the car aside and attended it. It is done. So I will start now. Okay, be quick. Okay. Hello Meera I'm so sorry all of this, in these times. How are you putting up? I don't know I'm unable to understand anything. I tried calling Sakshi. She did not answer. So I called you. Donâ€™t worry. We all are here for you. Sakshi called and asked me to report the post. And I did it May be she must be doing the same. She'll call you back. Yeah, may be. Is there anything that I can do for you? Do not hesitate to ask. Thank you Kiran. Please, can you do me a small favour? Tell me Meera. Find the hospital in which Sudheer is admitted in and update me about his status. Just tell me how he is, OK? Have you gone mad Meera? He trapped you in the right moment. And you want me to know his status? I donâ€™t care, even if he die. I can't do it for you Please Kiran... Meera, donâ€™t cry. Okay, I'll go. Okay, I will find out. Pleas stop crying. Please donâ€™t cry. Did you inform this at home? No. Then what is your next move? At least you must have told to Kalyan? Are you crazy Kiran? Kalyan does not have any idea about Sudheer. If he gets to know about all this now.. Thatâ€™s all. Then what are you going to do now Meera? Kiran please... I am tensed and confused already. I cannot answer your questions. First you just go to hospital and let me know the status. Then I can make some decision. Ok, I will go now. Don't worry. Sakshi call me. Hello Pooja, -Hey dear, We have started.. We will be there by 11 to 11 30. Oh! ok What happened Meera? You sound very tensed. No, nothing. I will send the house address to you. You guys can come. What yaar? Your brother has already send me the details of the accommodation Will go there directly? And I'll meet you soon darling Oh that's great! Are you not excited for the marriage? Why are you speaking so dull. Kalyan is going crazy. These days very few relationships end up in marriage You are so lucky Meera. Right! Pooja, listen. I have to take another call.. it's very urgent OK? Okay Meera.. I'll see you soon. Hello! Hello Sir? -Have you started? Sir, please let me know whatâ€™s happening there I cannot just start without knowing anything. Atleast let me know what is written in that note. Why are you dragging me into this? Hey, why are you yelling at me? I'm telling you for your own good. Nothing like that Sir, Its about to get dark How can I start now? Yes, you should. You had spent with him, knowing that you've got a wedding in 3 days. You should have thought about all these then. Now you are cooking up stories saying you cannot come. What? I met him? That too yesterday? I was not in Hyderabad yesterday sir. So you have celebrated your anniversary without meeting each other? And How dare you lying that it has been two years. The picture posted on Insta is an old picture sir. I never spoke anything about the picture. This is how people get caught. This is not at all fair sir. That picture was taken in the past anniversary celebrations when were in relationship. Who will celebrate fourth anniversary after a break up? So you say, he left his room filled with your memories and have not changed it since last 2 years. Lets leave it. Even those candles were left the same? All lit up? Donâ€™t fool around. -Please listen to me once. This has become like a trend to you girls. You girls date anybody you want And leave them at some point. Then marry someone of your parents choice. Excuse me! I think you are crossing your limits Hello Madam... I can speak English better than you. It is not about me crossing the limits. First you need to cross Vijayawada and come here. Otherwise, police will directly knock on your door. Understood? It is not like that sir. Then what? Everybody will compare the boys dumped by the girls to a scapegoat. But as to my opinion, The one who will be marrying you is the real a scapegoat. First hang up and come to Hyderabad. Hello aunty, Meera, I've told you many times Not to call me aunty but mother-in-law. Sorry... sorry... Please tell me Mother-in-law I called you, but you didn't call back. Kalyan must've told you. I have kept all the works aside and am waiting for your call. Sorry, was little busy. Of course, everyone's busy dear. It's a wedding time. Okay, I've showed you two sarees the other day. Yellow and blue. Which one did you like. Am fine with anything aunty. Sorry, Mother-in-law. Kalyanâ€™s sister, liked the blue one so much. If you too like the blue one, then I'd ask her to adjust with the yellow one. Am good with anything. Please give her the blue one. Do no hesitate my dear. Please choose the one you like. Mother-in-law, there is absolutely no need to debate on this. Ask Divya to take whichever saree she wants. I will talk to you again, please. Donâ€™t call her by name. call her Sister-in-law. Once listen to meâ€¦ [What did you say to my mother?] [she is upset] I hate this! I hate this! Sakshi, where have you been? Meera, I have deleted that post Sudheer tagged you. Unless someone had seen it by now, we are out of trouble. Why is this happening to me Sakshi? That was an old pic. Why did he post that yesterday? And why did he attempted suicide on next day? He could have died happily. Why did he write my name in the note. Thatâ€™s whatâ€¦ We knew he is psycho, now we know he's insane. Did SI say anything about that note? No, he is not saying anything. He insist me to come down. However, I've asked Kiran to visit hospital. to know some more information. Meera, donâ€™t worry. Everything will be fine. This is all my fault. Don't say that Meera. Do Kalyan know about Sudheer? No, he don't. Once when I was with Kalyan, Sudheer saw and spoke badly about us. When Kalyan asked.. I said that he is an ex-colleague and is after me for love. But Kalyan is not aware of our relationship. Oh God! I am ruined Sakshi. No Meera! Please donâ€™t cry. Nothing will happen. -What else should happen. You said it is an old picture, right? So there is a chance of it being in Google Photos. and with the date, we may prove it as an old picture. What do you say? Brilliant Idea. I will check right away. Ok Meera, now what do you want to do? I don't know. Make a decision soon. I will call you again. "In my eyes in my dreams" "why ended.. the light here itsef " "In this heavy rain Is it a continuous journey" "why it is strugging where is the end?"

" Oh God! Oh God! What's wrong with him? He was doing well. These men are sick, the girl is everything while in love And mother becomes important after the wedding He's driving me crazy. Mother?? Where the hell are you? Mother, please give the phone to Dad. He will not listen to your stories today. He is very angry that you are not home yet. Okay, leave that. I need to talk to Dad once. It is important, give the phone to him. What the matter? Did you crash the car again or what? Mother, nothing like that First let me speak to dad. Okay Dear. -Yes. Your daughter wants to speak to you. What's that emergency now. Subbu...get some mango leaves... doorstep should be decorated What's the emergency now? first ask her to come home then we can discuss here. Thatâ€™s what I asked, But she shouted at me to give you the phone. Okay, she is a little girl. And do not know anything. Yes dear, Where are you? Whatâ€™s the matter? How long will you take? Father.. actuallyâ€¦ Time is 7 already. Have loads of works here. We need to wake up early tomorrow. You are still roaming on the roads. Father.. actuallyâ€¦ No more talking, Just come home. You did not call Kalyanâ€™s mother? it seems. She called us and gave a lecture on "How to respect elders?" for half an hour. I did call her father. And spoke to her. That is not enough dear. You cannot have beautiful life in marriage with such kind of attitude. Never take that family for granted. Understood? If something comes up tomorrow, they will say nothing about you. But they will talk only about us. And our parenting. -Dad stop it. At least you should believe in your parenting. How can the priorities change once a girl turns into bride? You have raised me for 25 years. Now you only care about my in laws. How can you let go your daughter so easily? Hey brotherâ€¦ Hey Sister.. where are you? Why aren't you picking up dadâ€™s phone? What is the matter? Did you had an argument with brother-in-law? No... Then it must've been with your mother-in -law. I've been telling you. Though she looks slim, she seemed like one of the old film villains. No dear. Then what is the issue? Just tell me where are you? On NH-65 Why are you going to Hyderabad? Have you lost your mind? Or you really donâ€™t want this wedding? First tell me what is happening. Just listen to me. You know Sudheerâ€¦ That guy, who harassed you after you break up.. I told you then, that we will inform Dad about him. You've never listened to me. See now... whatâ€™s happening. Yeah, I never thought, it'll lead to this. We aren't talking since past two years. So I thought it is all over. Please try to understand and donâ€™t yell at me.. Then, what are you expecting from me? If Mom and Dad gets to know about this.. What should I do now? Somehow, you need to convey this matter to Dad. Please bro. What? To Dad? Oh my god? I never dared to ask Dad for my internet-bill. How can I speak about this? If someone can help me, it's only you. Please. Okay, I will try my best to convey this. But, what about brother-in-law. And, what about your Mother-in-law? Okay, somehow I'll manage. Petrol. Fill the tank. Sure madam. Hello, is it Meera? Yes, who is this? Madam, I am a constable speaking from Raidurg Police station. Okay SI sir wants to know if you have started to Hyderabad? I am on my way Please share your live location to my number. What? Sir ordered me to track you and update to him. Okay. This card is not working. Please give me another one. Try again. I tried twice. Take the card madam. Yes Kiran, Meera, I am here at the hospital. Sudheer still in critical condition. As of now... Besides his family and police, no media people are here. So the news must not have gone out. Did you get to know anything about his suicide? He slit at the pulse point Actually Meera.. Actuallyâ€¦ Meera... I don't know how to tell you this. For godâ€™s sake, please say... Is everything Okay? I heard peaple saying that you were with him yesterday... and you guys celebrated your love anniversary. Then you dumped him for the wedding. But the truth is.. I came to Vijayawada two days ago. He is smart Meera. Am sorry that he trapped you. His whole family is here And his father was speaking to the police. I think he is an influential person. Yes his father is a politician. That can also be a reason for seriousness from station SI. Meera.. how did you travel to Vijayawada. By car. Why? May be, we can use the toll gate slips to prove that you've gone to Vijayawada two days ago. Thatâ€™s why I want to know. Toll gate app is linked to FasTag that has my fatherâ€™s number. So all the messages will go to his number. Oh shit! What shall we do now? My father is calling. I donâ€™t know how to deal with him. Meera it's okay. It's not okay... Okay, anyway you are coming, right? We can discuss then. Hey who are you? Friend of that girl? No sir, who are you? I was listening to the whole conversation. If something happens to my son.. I will see the end of that girl and her family. What are you saying sir? Who are you? Stop playing your games. I know that you are speaking to her. Give me that phone. Why are you taking my mobile? -Give me the phone. Give it to me. -Leave my phone. -Kiran.... I said give the phone. -Leave the collar. Just leave the collar first. Kiran... Take off your hand. What the hell are you talking? -Kiran... Kiran... Why are you kicking me? Don't you understand? - Am I talking to you? Kiran... Kiran... -If anything happen to my son, I'll kill all of you Hello! I am so sorry Kiran I'm so sorry. This is all because of me. I'm so sorry Kiran. I'm so sorry Kiran. Hello Daddy. It's me Mom. Where the hell are you. -Mom, am going to Hyderabad. What the hell is wrong with you. Why have you grown up this way in our parenting? Your father shouldn't have given freedom to you. Everything had happened as per your say. Mom, please listen to me once. When you brought a stranger to the house and said that you will marry him. We should have slapped you then. It is our mistake to say yes. Anyway, he is such a nice guy. How could you deceive him. If they get to know about this, what will happen? If the wedding stops, We will lose all the respect. Radha, give me the phone. Stop scaring her. Dear Meera, Daddy... I'm so sorry. It was an old relation, happened two years ago. He do not want me to get married. So he is doing all this intentionally. Dear... dear.. Please relax Relax. When did my life get so complicated, Dad? When you made it. Either going alone You could have ask me, and I would have come with you right? I was so stressed out. Worried that you might judge me. I called you and tried to tell you everything. By then, you were already angry me. I cannot think bad about you Meera. I have faith in my parenting. Anyway, what ever happened has happened. I know an ACP there, I will check if he can help us. From which police station you got the call? I will ask him to call the station. Its Raidurg police station. Okay, not to worry. Be brave. I will handle all this. Okay daddy. See dear, when there is no trouble.. everyone speaks bravely. But once the problem arrives, thatâ€™s the actual time we need to be brave. Donâ€™t you take any stupid decisions in the meantime. Okay? Sure daddy. Sakshi, you know what Sudheerâ€™s father has done to Kiran.. -Hey, listen, listenâ€¦ Meera where are you. I have to tell you something. I'm on the way, tell me. Just now Police visited my house Enquired about you and Sudheer. To your house? Why? What did they ask? About you, your relationship with him.. And... -And... Actually the reason to this to become such a big case is... They think that you were with Sudheer yesterday And took financial help from him. Made him to transfer you 15 lakhs. What.. me? -Yes Mera. Just check if any transaction happened to your account. No way.. if such a thing happens, there will surely be a message. Just check once. -Yes, wait. Oh my God? What happened? Yes sakshi. 15 lakhs has been credited in my account But why did send the money. That I donâ€™t know. But once the money is transferred, youâ€¦ Donâ€™t think much. As per nowâ€¦ They are doubting whether this is suicide or Murder? Are they mad? That means.. they think that.. I have killed him, created as a suicide, Made a suicide note And written my name on it? Yeah.. And that inspector was always on phone with Sudheerâ€™s father. I think they banged Kiran also in the hospital. I have heard something over the phone. I'm very tensed about him. He went there for my sake and got in trouble. Oh no! Really? The most happiest moment of your life had turned this way. I'm so sorry Meera. You need not say sorry. What will we do now? Sudheer troubled you in this happy time Sakshi, Kalyan is calling me. Did he got to know about this? Talk to him once. Only then you will know why he's calling you Hello! What's the hell is this Meera? Kalyan... This is not done. Kalyan, can I just explain... What do you want to explain? Kalyan this not what you think Oh! Really? Then tell me.. What should I think. Kalyan, I will explain you everything But just relax okay.. Relax.. What will you say Meera? This wedding is a celebration of our love Meera. I thought of enjoying these moments. But you destroyed everything. Kalyan, I can understand. I will react in the same way if I were you. But you need to know one thing. Everything is purposefully done. Purposefully? Purposefully? What do you mean? My mother is doing all this?? How can you say this? Your mother? Why would I say about your mother? What are you talking about? Tell me what are you talking about? I said my mother was hurt. But you havenâ€™t called her. Not even a texted her saying sorry.. I am asking about that. And you were saying that she has done this purposefully. What should I do now. -Say sorry to my mom. What Why You should not have spoken harshly with my mom. No I did not. I just said that she can decide for me. Why she making a drama out of this? I am going through enough already Drama? My mother is giving more priority to you than her daughter, And you call it a drama? What's wrong with you Meera? Seriously, you want to do this right now? Meera, I donâ€™t want to argue with you. Just give a call to my mom Call her and say that, I was nervous and soâ€¦. Hello... -Hello... Is this Meera? Yes sir. I am ACP Raghavarao Just spoke with your father. I am so sorry for this unfortunate incident right before your wedding. I got some information about the case. Okay sir. Actually, If it was a normal suicide note, It would have been just a small enquiry. But it is being considered as fraud and forced homicide. And since his father is a politician. So, it has become a big case. So you must report in the station. But sir, seriously I have nothing to do with all of this. I was implicated in this case Listen... I will take a conference call with SI This whole conversation is being recorded And answer his every question clearly. Don't miss any details Okay -Okay sir. Good evening sir.... -Good evening Vikram We also have Meera in this call. I just want to know what is actually happening Sir! Today evening, around 4 pm, we got a call from hospital. About Sudheerâ€™s suicide attempt. They said that his situation is critical They gave us the suicide note found in his pocket. Meeraâ€™s name was mentioned in it. Okay, How can you suspect her as accused? just because her name is written. In the note, it is written that Meera was in relation with him till yesterday and since she needed money, I have transferred 15 lakh rupees from my parents account to her. But she has dumped me and marrying another guy. I loved her so much. I could not take her betrayal That is why I am killing myself. That is what is written in it. Have you checked her bank account. Yes we did. 15 lakhs were transferred to her. But sir, that was done without my knowledge. I did not ask him for any financial help. My father is a central government employee. My mother is also working. My monthly pay check is 80k. I certainly do not need his help. Meera.. please. Sudheer had done this without his fathers notice. That is why we have kept her account on hold. Oh, so that is the reason my card did not work. If not, you would like to use the free money, right. You checked my bank account. So you must be knowing my balance other than that 15 lakhs. Why will I need his money? We will figure that out from where you got all that money.. What the hell? Okay... ok Meera, please be patient. Mr.Vikram, until the case is proved, it is not fair to speak like this. Now let me know the other details. Yesterday night they celebrated fourth anniversary sir. They posted the picture on Instagram too. But Meera was saying that she had left to Vijayawada two days earlier.. And when I informed about the suicide, with no regard she asked If he had died. Firstly it was an old picture sir. Being a police officer, you should not manipulate my words. If it is an old pic, why did she ask her friends to report it and finally tried to delete it. Then my suspicion got stronger. But I took the screenshot of the post. I am about to get married in two days sir. If anyone from my would-be family sees the post the my life will be spoiled. I was left with no other option. What I can do.. Meera, where were you last night. At my home. I came to Vijayawada two days ago. But in victimâ€™s room, the room decor as seen in the photo was intact Sir, he must have recreated all that? What, including the lit candles? We also found her dress she was wearing in that room. Meera, you say now. What happened actually. I joined in Infosys five years ago. I met Sudheer there. We were in the same team. Like then we started seeing each other Six months our relation went well. Then Sudheer wanted a go physical. But I was against to that. From then on, we had lots of issues. Sudheer starts behaving strangely Our relationship turned into abusive one. One night he tried to force me in a car. Thatâ€™s when I broke up with him. He kept on torturing me after that. So I resigned from that office and joined TCS. Then I met Kalyan, my would-be. When Sudheer got to know that I am in love with kalyan, He came down and tried to make a scene. I threatened him that I will file a complaint against him. From then he did not turn up again. I blocked him on the social platform, when he started torturing me there. All this happened two years ago. Now since am getting married, he purposefully wanted to do this. Does anyone else know about your relation? My brother and my best friend Sakshi. If it is a revenge, why would he commit suicide? He is that kind of a person. A big psycho. He does not care about his life. But will never allow me to marry anyone. He threatened me on this many times. How did he get the dress you are wearing in the photo in his room? It's just a dress.. That does not mean I was there. Thousands of such dresses are available in the market. What are you talking sir? Of course, the environment is very similar. We have a doubt that she was there while he was attempting the suicide. To confirm that, we are waiting for the victim to gain his consciousness. Means, I killed him, I have made the note and written my name on it. Doesnâ€™t it seem illogical?? I know who is behind all this. What? Just donâ€™t blindly follow that politicianâ€™s commands. You need to use your brain sometimes. Shut up! You shut up. He can be an influential person But who gave you the right to spoil an innocent's life. Okay... ok Meera calm down You should not speak like that with a police officer. Vikram... -Sir... stop doing influenced investigation and do an ethical investigation. And especially Keep media away from this Because there is a girlâ€™s life associated with this. Okay sir. And Meera. Don't worry. First come to Hyderabad. We will definitely look into this more clearly Okay sir Hello kiran, Not kiran... This is Narsing Yadav, father of Sudheer. Where is Kiran? He is guiding me to your house. Where are you ? My house? Why are you going to my house. If anything happens to my son, I will not spare anyone in your family. Uncle please, I haven't done anything wrong. We will discuss this once Im there. My house is filled up with our relatives. If you show up in front of everybody, my parents will lose their respect. They won't be alive to feel bad.. Stop seeing things as Sudheerâ€™s father, What if your daughter faces such a situation.. Please think once. I donâ€™t have a daughter. Even if I had one, I am sure, she will not be like you. You have used my son and ditched him. Because of you, my son is going through so much now. But you want to get married happily. I will also see how it happens. You only know from Sudheer's viewpoint. Once please listen to what I have to say, then you will speak differently. Now you are saying stories to me. I'm not going to leave you. -Uncle, please listen to me once. Uncle, Hello... Sister.. where are you now? Did ACP called you? Yes, butâ€¦ -Sister.. am asking you. First listen to me. Parents are really tensed and waiting for your call. I wanted to call. But.. Did my brother-in-law got to know about this? No Donâ€™t make us tensed. Tell me. Shall I ask father to come? No need. Just listen to me. Oh okay, tell me then. Sudheerâ€™s father called. He is threatening me that he will send his people to our place. And will not spare any of us.. Am really scared. What are you saying? The house is filled with our relatives. Your would-be family has already started from Guntur. If something happens then.. Nobody can face it. Oh no! Wait... dad will talk to you. Done. Its all done.. Sister, I have brought the rope to tie the leaves. Where shall I place it. Give that here. That rope is the right thing I needed now. Hey, stop all this. Have you lost it? Hey you go out and check if there are all item need for Pooja(prayer). Go quickly. Okay brother. Donâ€™t create a scene. She is already stressed out. Donâ€™t tense her more. We cannot be patient like you. Just give me the phone here. Dear.. -Daddyâ€¦ Donâ€™t worry about us. I will take care of the things here. How long have you gone. About half way Dad. You have gone that far, then do not think about home. What if Kalyan gets to know about this, Then we will understand how much he loves you. -But fatherâ€¦ Listen.. dear..Love is not in making hundred calls a day..and saying I love you. When tough situations arises, then love is expressed in right actions. First focus on the driving. Keep updating us whenever possible. Sure daddy. Hey Pooja, Is there any theme for Sangeeth? No yar. Can I wear Ghagra then? Your wish. Are there Drinks? Not for me, Bhuvi wants to know. No alchohol. What are you saying.. We are not coming then. Okay.. Okay? What happened Meera. What's wrong with you? Nothing much. Am just tired. Don't snatch for phone like that How many times have I told you not to do that? How can you be tired already? You still have to deal with many other events, wedding and honeymoon too. Okay, I'll call you back Pooja. Sakshi, -Meera.. Yes tell me. Our friends, who have reported about that Insta picture, were interrogated by the police. Is it? They are angry on me that I have dragged them into this. And they doubt you that you've done all this. Everybody will do mistakes in life Meera. You need not be afraid in front of me. Small mistakes will lead to bigger ones. So share everything with me. What are you saying? Are you doubting me? Until now, I did but Oh! So now, you do not believe me. If you donâ€™t trust me... There will be no one else to believe me. Not like that Meera. -What Sakshi? Did I hide anything from you since our childhood We were in the same college. Worked in the same office. When Sudheer proposed, I have told my response to you first. You forced me to move on with Kalyan.. It's you who said that he loves me so much Only then I said yes to Kalyan. Anyway, I thank you for all the help you have done. Meera, you and your conscience know the truth. But also think... How long you can hide this from Kalyan? Hello! Kalyan.. Hey Meera, what happened? Whatâ€™s with your voice. Kalyan, I need to say you something. Oh god! this is not the time for this. Hello Meera... Kalyan, Hello... Hey, what is that sound? What happened. Car tyre busted and lost control. What...? Are you OK? Where are going at this time? Are you still dealing with the wedding activities? We will reach your place in about half hour.. Yes, I need to talk about that. Whatâ€™s the matter Meera? Are you in the car? Yes, Okay. please listen to me But I request you not to react. At least not in a way that others understand your reaction. Meera! Now you are scaring me. Kalyan Iâ€™m going to Hyderabad. What? -Now? Thatâ€™s what I am saying. I am expecting a subtle reaction Okay, sorry. Tell me, but.. Why now?? Kalyan... I have hidden something from you. Before you, I had one relation with someone else. Kalyan... Kalyan... please say something. With whom? Sudheer. He was a team member in my old office. Why are you saying this now Meera? Kalyan, I am in big trouble now. Oh nice! So, you are saying this now because you are in trouble. Not like that.. Please Kalyan. Hello... hello... Please listen to me Kalyan. Kalyan! Hello! From ten minutes, you stopped at same place. Sir wants to know what happened. I just stopped. Did not run away. I am asking you why? What kind of torture is this..? Is this called third degree? Madam, No need to shout. Just answer our questions. My car tyre got punctured. Now shall I hang up. -Ok Hello Kalyan Kalyan! Driver once just stop the car. -Why now? A call from office. and it's urgent. You can call after going there. Mom, it's urgent. Just stop the car once. What else are you hiding from me? Kalyan, promise. It happened two years ago. Then why are you going to Hyderabad now? For inviting him to our wedding? Kalyan, what are you saying. I am in a bigger problem. I got a call from Raidurg Police station. I am going there. What? From police station? That Sudheer attempted suicide. And tagged my name to it. And police were suspecting that I was with him yesterday. Are you with him? Oh, do you think I am? How would I know? About the things you are hiding from me. Kalyan, it's been two days I have come to Vijayawada. You know that right? Just like the way you are going now, May be yesterday also you would have gone. Who knows. Kalyan... seriously? I thought you would understand me. Oh, like how? I donâ€™t care about with whom you spentâ€¦ before wedding or I donâ€™t care about with whom you spent after the weddingâ€¦ I should say that I will not mind. Is that what you want me to say? Yeah! Right. You havenâ€™t understood me in case of your mother.. How can I expect you to understand much bigger things. Oh! correct. You understood me far better than me understanding you. Congratulations Hello! You are still in the same place Why are you not moving? What is your problem -Sir wants to know why are you not moving Your sir is a man... he cannot understand my situation, it's fine. But being a women, why donâ€™t you get my problem Hello, donâ€™t say things like man, woman or others. Should I tell you something Your live location is stopped. Share it again. Hello! Meera madam?

Every day with a new image the problems comes. the ways are like time not always same Iin life, the pages we see is this so?only with this, we ll know whether this is sun or shadow if you have persistence in hear thats enough the fear, with fear will ran away from here Hello dear.. Hello daddy, Where are you dear? Did you eat something? I think I am deceived badly. I am so scared. What happened dear. Daddy, I have said everything to Kalyan. And? What did he say? Donâ€™t cry dear... calm down I got it. Daddy, the groomâ€™s family reached our guest house. Daddy! You don't worry dear.. I'm here I will manage everything. I will go and talk to them. Okay? Okay daddy. Hey Meera... -Tell Bhuvi We just reached the hotel. I do not see any wedding celebrations here. Wedding is at home.. right? -Kalyan is not picking up the call. They might be in journey too.. Bhuvi, I'll call you back. Meera, will you come to our place? Pooja was asking. -No, Iâ€™m busy with some other work. I will meet you tomorrow Hopefully. Hopefully? I mean Iâ€™m not sure how much time I can give you. -Oh? Okay Okay, bye bhuvi. Bye Meera. Hello Divya, Sorry. Hi sister-in-law.. What the hell is this Meera? Excuse me I didn't expect this from you. Do you know how much my brother loved you? Please listen to me once If we had known about your character before.. We would not have agreed for this marriage. Divya, you are crossing your limits. I thought she had no respect for elders. But she has no shame at all. Correct mom. We understood that your parents has raised you with no values and limits. You are judging me very quickly. -Otherwise? We thought your father was here to say sorry. But he called off the wedding. Cancelled the Wedding? It;s we who should call this off. You don't have that right What? My father cancelled the wedding? Dad called off the wedding? Yes. I wonâ€™t believe this. Even we are not able to believe this. He should feel sorry for having a daughter like you. But he is supporting you anyway. Without any self respect. You cannot disrespect me like this. What do you know about this? Kalyan has told us everything. Now we got to know about this. In no time your whole colony will know about you. All the men in the city are done? Now you got my brother? Hello.. aunty. Hold your dialogues for a while. Do you watch lot of TV serials or what? Meera, you are crossing your limits Of course I will. I am not here to take shit from you or your mom Meera! Yes, Tell me. Who are you to question me? This issue is between Kalyan and me. Kalyan is my brother. Then tie him a brotherhood band and worship him. You have no right to judge my character. Your indecent activities only gave me that right. Oh my god! Is just your husband the only man you have been with? What shit are you talking me? your brother shared about my affairs with you in pain with me Similarly he shared about your affairs to me when we were in love. Is your phone on speaker? After nine years of marriage If your husband listens to this It will not sound good. You bloody... Shut your nonsense Yeah right! When it comes to you, you are saying shutup. Anyway... Just don't call me again Yes Bhuvi.. What about our dinner? How would I know? We have come to your wedding Why are you so irritated? Did not the blouse fit properly? You were in the same mood from evening. What do you want now bhuvi. -Dinner.. Order whatever you want I will pay the bill. Okay? -Fine. Yes dear.. Why did you cancel the wedding Daddy? Husband should support his wife when she is into trouble. Not the one who suspects and disrespects her. Kalyan is not of that type Daddy. He donâ€™t trust you. I donâ€™t trust him and handover my daughterâ€™s life to him. Anybody who's in Kalyan's shoes will react the same. Then what is the point of marrying him? You brought him to the house and told us that you both love each other. But I figured out the fact that.. only you loved him. If the wedding cancelled Sudheerâ€™s wish will be fulfilled thatâ€™s not correct In love, the couple stays very happy. But no one knows how long they both can be happy. I made sure that I will be happy forever with Kalyan. Only then I accepted him. Thatâ€™s why I said yes to him. In that case, Kalyan does not live upto your belief. -Oh, hello misterâ€¦ Stop all that non sense and come here. -Who are you? You cannot barge into my house like that. If something happens to our Sudheer sir, we will not leave you. Who is Sudheer? You will come to know, just wait some time -Hello dad... Who are you guys? If anything happens to our Sudheer sir, You will all be in trouble Daddyâ€¦ Daddyâ€¦ Hello. Daddyâ€¦ Hey, who is over that phone? Its non of your business. Because of your Sudheerâ€¦ my sister is going through a lot. She is facing so much trouble. You rascal, you call my sir disrespectfully? I will thrash your face like anything. If you donâ€™t move from here, I will file a police complaint on you. Really? Will you file a police complaint? Complain... go.. go.. Hey, why are you beating him? Who the hell are you? - Be glad I didn't hit you. Get out. Until my sir health is fine, we are not going to leave your house. Hello, It is me again, Sudheerâ€™s father. Uncle please Once listen to me My people are in your house, don't they? Please do not trouble my family. I'm coming to you. You can anyway punish me. Are you saying the moral tale of cow and tiger? -But the cow has said the truth. Am not that innocent tiger. -Sir, some officers are here to meet you. Now am busy Cannot meet anyone. Who is the officer? How would I know sir. They wanted to come to you I stopped them. Come Ask them to wait, I am coming. -Okay. Hey girl. You cannot deceive me like in the manner you did to my son. Dear! Some officer is here He is creating a scene Come quick. What's the hell is this? I am talking over the phone. Canâ€™t you see? Is she the girl? Give the phone to me! Look what she's upto. Listen girl He is already a dead person because of you. What else do you want? Aunty please, Uncle does not know anything about me You know me aunty We met me twice or thrice And still you believe in all this? My son is dying because he coudn't believe all this. It is very hard for me to digest this betrayal. And my son loved you so much This is not a surprise that he has gone to this extent. I am so so sorry Aunty. I can say only one thing. I have kept distance with him But I never betrayed him. Not just with you You have separated him from me too. If he is dead, you will be doomed to ashes. You will not understand What I am loosing.. I can understand what you are loosing as a mother But what am loosing being a girl due to Sudheer Is something you cannot understand. Bye aunty. I wish him a speedy recovery I am not saying this to get out of this case But I am saying this, I can understand a motherâ€™s grief Hello meera Where are you? I'm on the ring road. -One minute Meera Sir? Whatever the statement we recorded, make two copies of it. One for the court and one for us. Okay sir. Meera -Sir, tell me. I'm thinking to call you. We have a bad news Sir! Juts now Vikram called me Sudheer is still in the critical condition. But he gained little consciousness. He can only say yes or no. So in this situation, whatever he says becomes his dying declaration. And... So now.. Such kind of idiot shouldnâ€™t be alive.. But he should not die, for you to know the fact and skip the punishment. Sudheerâ€™s father sent his men to trouble my family at home Really? -Yes sir. They have beaten my brother too. Don't worry. I will take care of that. Thank you sir. Hello meera.. Kiran.. is that you? Where are you? What happened? Sudheerâ€™s father has beaten me and stopped me here. I have been trying to call you. But he snatched my phone. Talk a bit louder Cannot hear you Listen to me very carefully. I cannot talk louder than this. I am speaking from hospital staff's mobile. There are many media people outside the hospital Sudheerâ€™s father is speaking something seriously to them It is all very noisy here. I cannot hear anything. It's all over. There is nothing more to happen than this Sudheer has won. Meera, some one is about to come. I will call you again. Hello... Hello Meera... I told you right. I was stupid. I know that you are angry on me. Until Kalyan called me, I could not realise the truth. I was always your friend and well wisher Whatever happensâ€¦ I am always with you. Okay? Say something Kalyan called you? What did he say? He asked about all the details. He was angry that we deleted Insta post. He donâ€™t want me.. Why he wants to know about the details. It is not like that. -No Sakshi, Please donâ€™t say anything. I know it's over. Wait, There is some news on the TV. It is breaking news. Sudheer and Sudheerâ€™s father are on TV. Mom, up the TV volume. The girl who betrayed the son of a famous politician. (TV news) In the name of love, she has deceived him. (TV news) She forgot her promises.. But she has not forgot to cheat. (TV news) Love is pure But the girl is impure. (TV News) How could you do the things that are not there in the family. For money, you cannot do this way. Shame on you. It is a curse that you are born to me. For giving birth to a daughter like you, I should hang myself How could you do this sister. I have become a fool in front of my friends. Thank god! Before the wedding. I could know about your true nature. Now its Sudheer Who knows the list before. I'm ashamed to be your friend from all these years. I feel really terrible. We never thought that you are of this kind. For you I have gone to hospital and got beaten up. You are such disappointment to all of us. You have betrayed our trust on you. Crap! You need my son, you nasty face. Where did my son got you? We came to know this before the wedding. Other wise my brother's life would've spoiled You can live peacefully after this, but we cannot stay in this house or in this city. Or else we can have some poison and die together. You are not my daughter My daughter will not do like this. Hello sir. Hello Meera.. Good news You can go home dear. What? Yes dear I will let you know the details again. You need not come here Thank you sir. Hello! Meera! Daddy... ACP sir wants me to return home I donâ€™t understand the reason. There is nothing to understand. One hour ago.. I was disappointed that my daughter loved an idiot.. But now, I'm very proud that you loved him. You made a right choice. You need to ask your would-be. Would-be? Would-be? Daddy? Uncle, give it to me I'll talk to her Hello. Hello. I am so sorry Meera. My father was saying to ask you something Meera, relax. Please give a minute After talking to you I was really angry Then I called to Sakshi and got all the details. When I heard about that Instagram account, I know that you guys have deleted it. So I went to his account and saw the post I also saw the accounts of his other friends too. Luckily I got a video where these guys were partying in Sudheerâ€™s farm house yesterday. And I was shocked, after watching it. While he was partying in his farm house How can he celebrate fourth anniversary with you? So, can we get that video now? Yes There were drugs along with alcohol supplied in that party. Immediately, I called the narcotics department and forwarded the video. Then they met Sudheerâ€™s father. Sir, some officers are here to meet you. Who is the officer? -How would I know. They wanted to come to you I stopped them. Come fast. Oh my husband Some officers are here Creating a scene Come quick Not just to these narcotics department.. But I called media as well. By the time officers are there, media was there already. So Sudheerâ€™s father got pannicked. Then he lied that his son was not here And had gone to Mumbai for some business work and returned this evening. That lie has added to our advantage. Meera listen carefully There are many media people outside the hospital Sudheerâ€™s father is speaking to them very seriously. It is all so noisy. I can't hear it all When Sudheer was not in the city... How could he celebrate fourth anniversary in his flat. By the time I came to your house, Sudheerâ€™s men are here. Then I spoke with his father. I just asked.. Is it better to have a section 420 case on you Or a drug scandal case on your son? Drugs case will give him seven years of jail punishment. Then they have taken back the case on you. So.. thatâ€™s it. I have not left you darling.. I was just angry on you. That you have not shared this with me. You have started to Hyderabad all by yourself That means, you thought that I cannot help you But you helped me right? When your sister spoke with me, I have lost all the hope. I was so angry with you. The issues between wife and husband should stay within them. See meera You have openly said about Sudheer by yourself What if I came to know through some one else. So that raised my respect on you. Similarly any issue related to both of us.. It should not be known to our family through someone else. We should say by ourselves. Then only we can respect each other. Thatâ€™s why I have said sorry to you personally.. Then what about your mother, sister, relatives and society? Oh! Lord Rama asked Sita to jump into the fire Despite knowing about her. Why? For the sake of society. But still the society was not satisfied. Again they have sent her to forests. So, we should ignore society as much as possible. I love you Kalyan. I really really love you I was really scared that I lost you. Thank you baby. For all the trust you had upon me. Your father has told everything to me. Enough is enough. So much drama happened for today. What shall I wear for Sangeeth? Armani or Manyavar? I'm fine if you are only on boxers. I love you And I really really can't live without you No. I love you more. Hello sir.. I could not talk to you properly before. SI Vikram is also with us. He wants to talk to you something Okay sir. Sorry Meera While we investigate the cases.. Sometimes we had to speak harshly with the accused. Thatâ€™s what happened in your case too. Tell me one thing... Finally, you were not with him yesterday right? -Of course not sir. Thatâ€™s what I was saying to you from the beginning. We got an information from a source He was there in the farm house party yesterday We got the video too. Drugs were also served in that party. We have evidence that Sudheer was doing drugs. Then it means he's not with me, right? Yeah right If it is proved that he was not with you yesterday He will be arrested in the drugs case. For which he gets seven to eight years of jail punishment. Why is he calling me now? What did you say? Sudheer is calling me now sir. Just merge the call and Donâ€™t reveal about us. Okay sir. Hi Meera! Thank you. I didn't think that you answer my call I have troubled you so much. I'm so sorry. You were with me yesterdayâ€¦ We celebrated the fourth anniversary You took financial aid of 15 lakhs from me This is all the story created by me I was angry that you are not mine anymore. So I could not stand that. Please forgive me Meera Forgive you? Please do me a favour? -Favour? To you? If you cannot save me Its not upto the god to save me What is it? Please accept that you were with me last night What?? I was involved into one drug scandal. To get out of that case, we need to prove that we both celebrated the anniversary Please do help me. Please.... Are you speaking to that girl? -Yes dad. I will speak with her. We have no right to ask you a favour. But please forgive us and save my son. I will personally say sorry to each member of your family. To save my son, she has did this favour. I will say this to everybody myself. Please save my son. What you have said is very true. You donâ€™t have right to ask me a favour. You both go to hell. Please listen to me Meera... Please Meera. You have got bloody friends Got used to drugs and alcohol And played suicide drama When will you change you rascal? Dad... dad... Please donâ€™t beat me father Please.. The whole conversation is recorded sir. Our work is lightened. Meera, what did you say with him? You both... Sorry sir, I will not talk to you that way.. Hello Rahul... -Sister... Daddy said that you are fine. Please do me a help. What is it? Tell me We need to give Rs.5000 to the tailor Please go and give. Now? Please go and give it somehow.. It is urgent. its her sonâ€™s birthday. Ok I will go. Hello Pooja.. You need beer or beer store for Sangeeth? Hey, Meera is back... Meera is back... Meera is back... Hello Sakshi.. I'm coming to you. We will pick up kiran and leave to Vijayawada. Okay.
