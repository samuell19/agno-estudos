Hi, I'm Emma and I'm 23 years old, and I want to come live in your house. - Hi, I'm Matt. - Hi, my name is Danny. Charlie, just... Charlie. Like Madonna. Rex. I'd like to be on the show because... I want to get famous. The prize is still a million dollars, right? The challenge. For the experience, I guess. Just to learn about myself. You know, grow as a person and all that bullshit. - Why should you pick me? - You should pick me 'cause... I'm a fucking people person. Um... why should you choose me...? 'Cause I'm a team player. What do I think about the rules? - What? The nightly curfew? - If it's a house in the middle of nowhere, what would be the reason to break the curfew anyway? If we stay indoors... when we're sleeping and go outside during the day, it's not a hard thing. Well, usually I don't like girls, but, you know, these ones don't bother me. I think I could stick to the rules for a million dollars, yeah. Hey, check it out! I think we're being watched. Get up! Good morning. I'm sure this will be of interest to some of you. Morning, Matt. You guys definitely waste food. I miss fresh fruit. Are you gonna eat those? Go nuts. You know what I miss? The ocean. I miss June... My social worker. June... if you're watching this, I miss you. When we get out, we're going to look so yesterday. Next week we'll have plenty of money to buy new stuff. Hear, hear. What do you miss, Emma? Intelligent conversation. Amen, sister! I miss my grandpa. Oh, grandpa! Here you go, Danny. I'm gonna take him on vacation when we get back. I miss my friends. Although I'd like to think that I've made some new ones. Aiee-ee! Probably just a coyote. Yeah, it's always a damn coyote. I hate this house. Fucking creepy-ass house. What is it? You see anything? Nope, nothing as usual. He's cute, right? He's cute. So? So? So I'd prefer my intimate moments to be intimate moments. It's not a porn site. You could always do it under the covers, or in the den... the freezer. I don't know, there's just... there's something. He's just so intense all the time. Well, yeah. He's a guy, and it's been like six months that he's been here. He's really fucking horny. He'd fuck a hole in the wall. Shh-hh. Okay, let's take a look. It's definitely cold in the house. Nobody brought the flashlight down here, huh? - What do I do with the clicker thingy? - I'm fine. Oh, you motherfuckers. Oh, yeah, this is deliberate. They're putting the squeeze on us. Look at this. Everything has to have an angle with you. Couldn't it have broken down? So what do we do? - I don't know. - Let's light a fire. There's no dried firewood outside. But there's plenty of dry shit in the attic. We can chop some of that up. Go to work, boys. Oh, God! It smells like piss in here! Looks like Mommy and Daddy used to keep the kiddies in the cupboard. What parent would do that? They must have been talking to my stepfather. Take cover! - Hmph. - I always wanted a talking one. "Oh, Emma?" "Yes, Matt?" "Oh, Emma." "Matt!" "Emma!" "Matt!" "Emma, Emma, oh, Emma!" "Oh, Matt!" "Oh, Emma!" "Oh, Matt! Matt, wait, wait!" "What? What?" "Matt!" "That's my ass." "I know, Emma, I know." Grow up, Rex. Don't give me that "nice guy" bullshit. You don't want to fuck? Don't give me that "nice guy" thing. "Oh, Matt... Matt... You don't have a dick. Why don't you have... You don't have a dick?!" You want to talk small dicks? Charlie talked to Emma. Take cover! Yeah. What the fuck are you laughing at? Today is the first day of the rest of your life as a non-smoker. Oh! Jesus, I have never heard so many fucking owls! You think they have a tape out there? So, I'm thinking... when we get back... are we gonna get mobbed or what? Have to go into hiding. Have a stalker. Hmm? Oh, yeah. You know the number one cause of most stalkings? Forgetfulness. Forgetfulness? People forget to close their curtains. Their curtains? I read about this one lady... who used to walk around inside her house at night, buck naked, lights on, curtains wide open. She was always forgetting to close them because her property overlooked some woods. No one out there, right? Well, there was. This stalker guy. Just watching those bright welcoming windows every night. He started to think she didn't shut them because she wanted him to see in. She was inviting him into her life. So he started this whole fantasy relationship with her, all built out of little things, you know, like when she'd hang her laundry out... That was like, a love token... an offering. So he'd steal her panties. Getting more and more intimate, this whole love affair in his head. So finally one night, he breaks in. Although when he meets her, he meets a stranger... An upset stranger freaking out, wanting him out of her house. He thinks she's just playing hard to get. So he asserts himself. Rapes her. Strangles her to keep her from screaming. Thanks, Matt. Yeah, thanks. Now, I suddenly feel all on display. What do you mean you suddenly feel all on display? It's like, hello, hello, hello! On the web is one thing, outside my window is another. You guys don't have to worry. Statistically, strangers rarely kill strangers. You're much more likely to be killed by somebody you know. A kid I was at school with killed his parents. No shit? What happened there? He used a hammer. He beat them to death. Jesus, that's a little harsh. Who was he? Did you know him? Give it up, Emma. I can't really remember. I moved away before it happened. So what was his name? Fuck. Probably just the wind. What is that? Matt, Matt! Oh, Jesus! - I'm sorry. - Danny! There's someone upstairs. - In the attic. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - All right. Let's go. It's coming from up there. It's okay. It's just scared. Crows can scent death. It's kind of a bad omen to have them flying around your house. Oh! I think it's hurt. Hold that. There we go, I got him, I got him. - Aw... - Look at him. It's got a broken wing. Oh! It was the kindest thing to do. I'll take it out at daybreak. - God, Rex. - What the fuck you guys doing up here? I'm going to bed. We had a visitor. - What? - Yeah. It must have thought it was trapped. Oh... Yeah, I can relate. This fucking house. What would I do for a million bucks? I guess I'd do as little as I had to. Would you drive to school naked? Would I have to get out of the car? Hey, guys, package! - Hey, that's a package! - Nice find, Danny! - I found it by the pool. - Come on, food, food, food! Cigarettes, cigarettes... Yes, yes, yes! Bricks? Bricks? - And a letter? - This isn't funny. - We need supplies. - They're tightening the screws. It's addressed to you. I want a letter. What is it, man? Danny? Hey... So... the letter said that the funeral takes place in two days, in Florida. - Florida? - Yeah. So obviously he wouldn't make it back for the curfew. - We can't stop him if he wants to go. - No. We're just going to have to persuade him that it's in his best interests to stay here, right? His best interests? Yeah, guys, look, we don't even know if this letter's real or not. Only a twisted mind would think of that. Yes, and they are twisted. What's this? What the hell, bricks instead of food?! You don't think this could be part of their game? Jesus Christ! Could you build a creepier house? What if they're fucking with us? All right, think about it. First, no heat, then no food, now this. You don't think this could be part of their game? Danny's the weakest link, - They want to break us... - Oh, come on, Rex! No, think about it. Really, really think about it. We are this close to a million dollars, guys. We are this close. They don't want to pay us. They don't want us to make it. Or maybe they're trying to spice it up for the viewers. Or maybe his grandfather is dead! Well, Emma, if his grandfather's dead, he's dead! - I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it! - His grandfather... practically raised him. What, do you have no feelings at all? Oh, cut the crap. I'm here for the money, okay? So are you. Dress it up however you want. "Exposure," "slumming it," "finding yourself," I don't know what. But the only person who's not here for the money is probably the person who needs it the most, but no... Danny's here to make friends. Okay, fine, let's be friends to the guy, let's give him some "help." Some long-term, practical help. We can't hold a gun to his head. - No. - No. Okay, we'll tell him we'll have an alternative memorial service in the yard. Emma, tell him. You tell him! Come on, Emma, we know he likes you best. Just ask him nicely. You would do it best. I knew we should have just let him go. Some things are more important than money. What, like pussy? Hey, man, fuck you! Doesn't family mean anything to you? You don't miss what you never had. Take cover! Let's go! Look! What... ...the hell? Jesus. It must have been one of the guys fucking around. No! Charlie... I think it's someone else. Who? I think we're out of the shot. Shoot. You know I told you all about that... kid at my school who killed his parents? His name was John Riley. Well, he wasn't just a kid at my school, he was a kid on my street. We used to play together after school. We had this one favorite game, "Scaredy Cat," where we'd see who could spook each other the most. And... it started out... jumping out from behind trees shouting, "Boo," that kind of thing. But then it got more serious. John had a kitten, which he adored. He'd sneak it into school in his knapsack. One time... I swapped the kitten for a brick. And I tossed the knapsack into the school pool. He was so scared he peed his pants... right in front of everyone. When I showed him the kitten was fine, he just gave me this look... this black look. Like... "Never turn your back, because one day I'm going to get you back for this." But he wouldn't surrender the game. He just kept screaming... "You... sick... bitch." First the bricks in the package, now someone writes this? It feels so personal, I mean... why am I being singled out? Charlie... you don't think that maybe... Emma, I just think that we've been in this house way too fucking long. Like Rex says, it's all a game. I bet it's just... But how would they know all that? I don't know. Research, I guess. I'm... Let's just go back to bed, okay? Come on, it'll be okay. Come keep me warm. Guys! Package! It better be food this time! Aw... Sweet. Champagne! They do still love us. Five. - One for each, I guess. - Motherfuckers. - What the fuck? - What?! I know what this means. I know what this... You fucking cocksuckers. I know what this means. Fuck you. Do your fucking research. 'Cause him doing that to himself was the best thing that ever fucking happened to me. Fuck you. What?! I say we put this out of harm's way. Come on. Let's go upstairs. What, do they think they can fuck with me now? His dad, right? You're here to check up on me. It's not a front, Matt. I just don't care. I wish I did, but... I don't. Anyways... I brought my own "coping mechanism." Sit down. Hand me that book. You want to worry about somebody, worry about Bundy. I don't know whether to feel sorry for him or be afraid of him. Why did they pick you, Matt? What are the skeletons in your closet? Like I'm gonna spill it now? Give them some ammo to shoot me with? That's good. Yeah, it's good. But if there are any, they got 'em already. The question is, do you have any... or are you just sliced white bread? Is someone out there? Emma? Are you okay? Well, Th-the security lights just popped and... I would swear there's someone on the edge of the forest. Look, you're just freaked out. Charlie told us what happened last night. Emma, you can't think this has anything to do with... To do with what? Well, when you were a kid, you know? Yeah. I guess that would be ridiculous. - I know. - Yeah. - Emma, what? - What's wrong? Oh, what is that?! Oh my God. - Oh shit! - Is that some kind of joke?! Rex, did you put that in there? - Fuck off, Charlie! - Is that blood? Just don't touch it! Put it down! - What the fuck! - I didn't put it there! - I didn't put it there! - Did you hear anybody? People like, fucking walking around the house?! - I don't know. - Everybody, calm the fuck down, please, for two seconds. Emma, there's nobody here, okay? Guys, this is the company all over again, all right? They've raised the stakes a little bit, but they're playing the same fucked-up game. So let's please calm down. They're coming inside now? Game over. I can't take this. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm going to radio them. They can pick me up. No, no, no, Emma. No, no. Just wait. Stay. Emma. Emma, Emma, look. It was me, okay? It was me. I'm sorry. It was a stupid joke. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's your problem, huh? What's your problem? Hey! What's your problem? - You're always picking on people! - Stop it! - Come on! - Stop it! Danny! It's not worth it. Are you okay? I'm here for the money. What's your excuse? What, you've got no life of your own? It's not real enough for you? No family? What is it? I pity you, you sad fuck. Rex? I just wanted to say that even for you that was really fucked up. Why would you do that? I didn't put it there, okay? I didn't put it there, Charlie. I just said I did so Emma wouldn't leave. I need that prize money, all right? I need that fucking prize money, and I wasn't going to let her leave. Oh, shit. Oh God, don't do that. Don't do that. I still think it's the company, all right? It's the company. But... how would they get it in there? I don't know. They control all this shit, right? It's what they do. It's part of their game. They wanted to spice things up so this is what they do. Plus, I think... you know, maybe they're... pissed off there hasn't been any... "action" or whatever. Well, not recently. Anyways... You think they're punishing us? Yeah, I don't know. Maybe. Maybe we've been punishing ourselves, you know? God, I wish I had a smoke. Charlie, Charlie, wait. Charlie, Charlie... wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. You want a cigarette? Don't say I never did nothing for you. One pack of cigarettes... for you. Oh my God. What the fuck is this? - Just some... - You hoarding little bastard! - Charlie, shut the fuck up. - Oh my God. Hey guys! - Guys! - Charlie, shut up. - Charlie, shut the fuck up! - Fuck you, you little prick! I'll split... Great. Why'd he take cigarettes? He doesn't even smoke. To fuck with me. Guy is a snake. He'd probably sell his own grandmother for cash. He says my grandpa's not dead. That the letter's fake... It's all part of a game. You think that's true? You guys got to give me some of that, you know? You are such a selfish bastard. Oh, fuck you. Fuck you. You are so fucking self-righteous. You're so fucking self-important. All this "John Riley" bullshit, for Christ sakes. Do you really think he gives a fuck about you after all this time? Jesus, you must really rate yourself, Emma. - You must really fucking rate yourself. - Knock it off, Rex. Oh, go fuck yourself, Matt. 'Cause she's not going to. You know... if I was a psycho killer, I wouldn't be hanging out there. I'd have my sights set right on this house. That's enough, Rex. Don't kid yourself, kid. She's not into you, either. Ahem... Hey, psycho! Oh my God. Don't be a fucking prick, Rex! - Psycho killer! - Rex! Come on in! It's nice in here. We got food, we got liquor, we got women. - Stop! - One in particular you might be interested in. Come on in! Fuck me, there actually is somebody out there. Oh shit, turn the lights off. There is someone there. Oh shit, he's heading this way. It's cold out there... Maybe he needs help or something. Emma, come on. We're going to open the door if you're 100 % certain it's not him, okay? I don't know, I don't know! - Is it John? - Please open up the door. No! - No, Danny, no! - It's all right. - What's wrong with you? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Get his I.D.! - Wait a second. Come on, some I.D. - What? - Some I.D. Identification of who you are. Hold on. Travis Patterson. It's nice to meet you. Look. Come on. Hey, give me the light. Oh yeah, you could fake this. Oh, come on. Do I look like I'm under 21 to you? - What's your star sign? - Cancer. What's yours? I'm a Gemini. See anyone else out there? Uh... just the reaper. I swear, a few more hours out there and I'd be as dead... I'd be as dead as the battery on this GPS. Let me see that. - It's a locator? - Yeah. So you know where we are? Yeah. You guys don't? - No, we don't. - No. Uh... I don't mean to be rude, obviously you're very concerned about security, but who the fuck are you guys? You don't recognize us? Should I? Are you on the internet? Yeah, all the time. I'm a programmer. And you don't know who we are? I'm sorry, I'm tired. Am I missing the joke here? We're part of an internet Webcast. Like a human aquarium. See, there's webcams all over the place, you know, even in the bathroom. They're running 24-7. People subscribe to us. - What's the name of the site? - We weren't told. You weren't... you weren't told? The company that set this up didn't start advertising till we got here. Well, they didn't do such a hot job, because I never heard of you, and I live online. - Maybe you live in the wrong area? - It's the internet. You know, it's the world wide web. - There's a lot of sites out there. - Yeah, yeah. There are, so why would I watch you guys? What's your hook? Well, she takes her clothes off. Shut up! Jerk. I'm Charlie. Hey, Charlie. Travis. Sorry my hand's so cold. You definitely sure you've never seen me before? No, I'd definitely remember. Uh, we're... we're here. Thanks. What's the scale of this map? On this map, what's the scale? Um... one to 50,000. Oh, fuck, we are in the middle of nowhere. Yeah, pretty much. What's the nearest town? Uh, Wilmington is. Where's that? That's... that's right... right over there. So where did you ski from? From my truck. So where's your truck? Where I left it, I guess. Hey, does anybody want to dance? Yeah. Yeah. Do you believe his story about skiing out here all alone? I don't know. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but it seems too convenient. You know, he didn't seem fazed at all by the cameras. Remember how... how freaked out we were when we moved in? "Were"? You going to pass that, tough guy? I hope Charlie knows what she's getting herself into. Emma? Do you want... do you want to dance? No, Danny. Thank you. I'm going to go to bed. Emma? Rex, do you want to dance? - You're an asshole. - Whoo-oo. Okay, I'll have some more. - You want to go upstairs? - Yeah. Yeah. - Mm-hmm? - Yeah. I hate that guy. He's a freak! "Mr. Skier." Oh-hh. Let's go to the bed. Oh, God. ♪ Sucking on my titties like you wanted me, calling me ♪ ♪ All the time like Blondie, check out my Chrissie behind ♪ ♪ It's fine all of the time ♪ ♪ Like sex on the beaches ♪ ♪ What else is in the teaches of peaches? ♪ ♪ Huh?

You so need to get laid. Come in, big boy. REX: "Big boy" has left the building. Sugar? Take cover! Danny? I'm going to say something to you and I want you to listen very carefully. Okay, I'm sorry about all that's happened to you, but it's no excuse. There's no excuse for you taking my things. I can't be friends with someone who does that, okay? I didn't take anything. Danny, I found these in your room. Okay? - I didn't take them. - Danny! Look, we're not here much longer, okay? So why don't we just try to be civil, polite and honest with each other? Okay? Matt, guys, get in here. Delivery? I'm out. I found it by the snare. It's Travis' backpack. - Was it a grizzly? - Oh my God. No. There are no animal tracks. No footprints, either. - We have to radio for help. - Whoa, help for who? - For Travis. - No, guys. It's not real. It's not real, it's part of the game. Relax. Please, it's not real. - Look, I don't know. - You don't know what? There's blood. He could be hurt. - He's not hurt, Danny. - Looks pretty real to me, Rex. He's not hurt. If he was hurt, where's the body? They want us to call for help, guys. That's what they want. They want us to call for help. If we do, you think some "Boss Hogg" cop's going to come down here and give two shits about our curfew when he sees my rap sheet? All you can think about is the fucking curfew. If we call the cops, we lose. That's what they want. That's what they want. Oh, Christ. Fine. Fine, you know what? If you're really that worried about him, talk to them. Talk to them. They can get help, right? Yeah, somebody... Come on, guys, look. You've seen what's happened here. You know where we are. Send help. Oh, yeah, and... Travis, if that is your real name, go fuck yourself. You're not going to scare me out of my money. Okay, buddy? Don't give them the pleasure, guys. Don't do it. They've had enough laughs at our expense as it is. Especially at you, Charlie. - What? - Especially at you. Fuck you. You know that whole thing was a setup, right? You know that. That's why he picked the easy target. You noticed he wasn't too afraid of the cameras, right? Travis, Travis, Travis. Where are you now, you son of a bitch? - Emma. - Danny. I didn't take your clothes. It was them. They're messing with us. It's just part of a game. Danny, please, don't. Look, I made this for you. Take it. Danny, I can't take that. I made it for you. Okay. Charlie? From Danny. Oh, I get it. It's your pussy. Hi, Emma's pussy. Scratch and sniff. Don't. Give him a break. He spent hundreds of hours down there bashing away with his little thingy. I mean... "Emma... Emma..." - Emma's creepy pussy. - It's horrible. Oh, guys! - Danny? Danny. - Matt. Matt, don't. Don't. He's dead. He's dead. - Emma...? Oh my God. - I can't look. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'll get it. - It's okay. - It's not okay! It's not okay. It's so not okay. What are we going to do? We wait for the helicopter. Game's over, right? Can't go on now. - What about... - It's not our responsibility. This is their fucking game. We played everything fair up till here, guys. This is not our fault. We did nothing wrong. We've done nothing wrong here. We can't leave him there. You're not supposed to move him. I saw it on TV. We can't move him. - We should cover him. - We should cover him. Or we could take him outside. Outside? Yeah, well, you want... Well, where else? Okay. You guys take him outside, and we're going to try the radio. Please? That's good. Hello, can anybody hear me? Please, somebody's dead. Please help. Please, we need help. Nobody's there. I just fucking can't believe that he'd... This isn't what we signed up for. No, this is not what we signed up for. What kind of a sick fuck would subscribe to this? Wait a minute. Hold on a fucking minute. I'm sorry the way things have turned out for us. It's okay. Come here. - Emma, I... - Guys! Guys, guys, you've got to fucking see this, okay? Where's Charlie? Charlie! You guys ever wonder how the company plans on bankrolling our paycheck? Did you ever think about how they pay for this house, the food, the goddamned helicopter? - Advertising revenue, right? - Subscription fees. Right, well, you don't get one without the other, right? If nobody subscribes, the revenues dry up. I've been thinking this guy Travis, he was a fucking programmer. The guy's a webhead. He should spend his entire fucking life on the internet, so how is it he'd never seen a single fucking ad? How is that? There's tons of shit on the internet. Right... That's why I went on the internet. Wait, how did you get on the internet? The screen is fucked. Satellite uplink still works. - Where did you learn how to do that? - Computer Club. I've been looking for our site. I have put our names through every single search engine I can think of and I have got nothing, guys. I mean nothing at all. Not even an advertisement. Nothing. Not a single fucking ad. The internet's a big place. Yeah, it is a big place, but what I want to know is why are they making it so difficult to find the site? If they want people to go to it, why are they making it so tough? Well, I did find it. It was fucking hard as hell, but I found it. - Yeah? - Yeah, but it's fucked. It doesn't have a name. It's a fucking beta site. I happened to trip over it. I was tipped off on some hacker newsgroup. What does that mean, a "beta site"? A beta site is like... It's like a password name. It's just a mess of letters and numbers instead of a real name. It's fucked. Take a look. - This is our site? - I don't know. I'm trying to subscribe. I've been using Travis ' credit card. This has a credit limit of $50,000. How do you know it's 50,000? You learn a lot of shit at Computer Club. Could buy a house with that. Yeah, but $50,000 doesn't get you through the keyhole on this site. I don't get it. I don't get it, either. I don't get it, either. This place doesn't fucking advertise. It doesn't even have a real address. I can't figure it out. The only thing I can come up with is it doesn't want to attract attention. But why is that? And the security... Holy shit... The security is fucking insane. I have thrown every hacker file I have at this thing... and we are talking about some serious backdoor fuckers... and I still can't bypass the encryption. So what's your point, Rex? My point... guys, simply put, is why the fuck would people pay so much money to watch us? I want to know is this thing legit? Is it fucking legit, is it fucking legal, for Christ sakes? - Like a porn site? - Yeah, like a porn site, but except for her escapades, it's hardly a porn site, is it? What is it then? What?! Am I the only person thinking this here? I mean, am I the only person? Is it only clear to me? Nobody's ever heard of a snuff movie before? Nobody's ever heard of a snuff set? Danny's dead already, for Christ sakes! - No, no, no, Danny killed himself. - How do we know that?! Oh, Jesus. No, Matt, then you fucking explain this to me. Because this is seeming kinda fucked-up to me right now. I mean, am I wrong? This is seeming kinda fucked-up! What the fuck? Oh, shit. Why are there numbers against our names? They're betting odds. - Oh my God! - They're fucking betting odds! You sons of bitches. You sons of bitches. - I can e-mail for help! - Relax. I'm just going to e-mail somebody. Come on, you son of a bitch. They've cut me off! These fuckers! The signal just died. Wait, Rex! Rex! Calm down! - You don't understand. There was no prize! - Calm down! No prize money, and they are going to fucking kill us! Guys, relax, relax. This is not a snuff web site. Come on, think about it. Who are they going to kill? The four of us? You're the one who keeps saying this is just one of their games. That's all this is, just another game. They're just fucking with us. Come on. We're almost out of here. Tomorrow we leave. - Tomorrow we get our money. - Tomorrow?! What about... What do we do tonight?! If you guys are that worried about it, I'll get the gun and stand guard till morning. You're still playing. It's dark out there, I can't see anything. The security lights would trigger if anyone was out there. What are you looking for, Rex? I know I fucking saw it in here somewhere. - What? - Come on, you son of a bitch! Bingo! I knew Travis kept an emergency flare. We can set this off. Yeah, but you'd have to go outside to shoot it. - I know. - He could shoot it from the roof. Yeah, okay. I just don't want to go out there by myself. So... I'll go with you. Okay. Okay, good. REX, DISTORTED: Don't worry, okay? Don't worry, this is gonna work. This is gonna work and somebody's gonna see it, and somebody's gonna call the cops. What, some "good citizen"?! They do exist, Emma. We knew one. You should have this. It's Danny's penknife. Okay. Rex? I-I never even gave him a chance. He didn't have a chance, Emma. They didn't want him to have a chance, okay? They? Emma, this isn't about your past. They just want you to think that. They just want you to think that. That's why they picked me? At first light... we head out, together, okay? Okay? And they can fuck their money. When I get out of here, maybe I 'll give L.A. another try. You know? I was really hoping that this would be successful. You're on prime time now. You think? The internet's global. You're always prime time somewhere. Huge in Japan. And you know how to be yourself in front of the camera. How to relax. That's half the battle, right? I guess. I don't feel very relaxed right now. Come over here. I'll help you relax. Oh, yeah. I can feel it. It's like a big knot. Yeah. Lean forward. Matt? You've got everything... why did you sign up for this? Curiosity. To see how it'd feel. What? The isolation? The fear. The fear? Yeah... it feels good. Should I kill her now? That's why you're watching, isn't it? Was that okay? Shit. Press the friggin' 'Turn' button, would ya? Matt? Guys? Hello? Press the button. Come on, today! Let's go. At first everything looked the same. Like nothing ever happened. I wondered if all of it had just been a bad dream. Boy, was I wrong. What the hell? No, not again. Damn it, it won't shut off. He's here. He's fucking here. He's come for us... We've got to go upstairs. Let's go! Come on, go, go! Come on! Can you hear anything? - Can you hear him? - Did you see him? I saw him get Charlie. Charlie...? What about Rex? Matt...? I'm the most worried about you now. - What are you doing? - Come on, it's just us now. - The door! - We've got to stick together. Emma? Emma? We belong together. - No... - We do! No! Th... Can you hear him? He's out there. - John! - No! - John, you out there? - No, Matt, no! Why are you turning the light on? Because I want them to see what I'm going to do to you, Emma. All that "John Riley" shit in your journal... You actually believe you triggered his psychosis. After all this time, he'd battle his way through some frozen wasteland just to win a childhood bet? Rex was right. That's some fucking ego, Emma. Get on the bed. Get on the bed, Emma. Fucking bitch! Ugh! Oh, you fucking bitch! Help! Help! - Help me, help me! - Calm down... What's going on here?! He's in there, he's in there! If you want some help, you have to calm down. He killed everyone... He's after me! Okay, listen, calm down. We have to follow procedure. Help me! Help me! Take some deep breaths for me, there you go. Inside the car. I'm gonna take care of it. - You've got nothing to worry about. - He killed everyone! Shh-hh! Are you the one that set off the flare? Huh? Yes? And there's somebody in there? - Yes. - Is he armed? - He has an ax. - An ax? - Okay, I'm gonna take care... - No, don't leave me! Stay calm, miss! I'll be right back, okay? Car 1057 requesting backup. You've got to let me do it! I was in this house six fucking months! What the fuck do you think I've been doing for the past six months? No! No! Just give me the fucking keys, man! No! What are you going to do? Bleed on her? I can do it! ...fucking keys! I can do it! No! No! MATT, EMMA: No! No... No-oo! Whoo! Time to celebrate. - To the company! - Company. Think they'll be pleased? You'll probably get a promotion. - You think so? - Yeah! Your own parking space. Parking space. Who do you think we are? You think we have an office? Business cards, a brochure? Huh? There is no "they," Matt. "They" is us. Just me, Travis and some very rich clients. Low overhead, maximum profit. As for product... well, there's always plenty of low-hanging fruit ripe to be picked. Always five suckers. You mean four. She's a little wriggler. You getting this, Travis? Yeah, looking good from here! Let me see. Matt?
