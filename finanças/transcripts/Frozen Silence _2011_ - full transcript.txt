Winter of 1943. General Franco sends the Blue Division to Russia, a combat unit made up of Falangist volunteers and veterans of the Spanish Civil War. Its mission: Help Hitler eliminate communism. But the Red Army has begun an unstoppable counter attack. Lost in a foreign land, the Spaniards faced hunger, frozen rifles and frozen hearts, fear of traitors... and themselves. Anyone from Meat Processing? Yes, sir. Get over here. Hurry up, we haven't got all day! Think we can use all this meat? Probably, with the shortage... Come here. Recognize him? No. He's not smiling. He doesn't have much reason to. No, I mean... If he froze to death, the muscles in his face should have stretched. Like the horses. You mean he was murdered? Stay here. And keep the others away. I'll radio the lieutenant. Sergeant! Sergeant! - What? - Look. Must have been the Ruskies. - Maybe not. - No? Maybe he cut himself shaving and went for a walk. No, you don't understand. Since when do the Ruskies worry about our souls? Look. GOD IS WATCHING I. GOD IS WATCHING Arturo Andrade! Arturo Andrade! - Andrade! - Yes. Yes, sir. Report to Headquarters. You're coming with me. Who called for me? Lieutenant Colonel Navajas del Rio, a high ranking officer. - What's it about? - No idea. I thought you knew. How should I know? Private Arturo Andrade, 2nd Infantry, Logistics and Meat Processing, Colonel. Don't promote me, Private. Listen, we're all worried about what happened and we think you're the best candidate to catch this guy. How about it? Excuse me, sir, I... I don't follow. Nobody told you why you're here? No. The soldier murdered at the lake... Sergeant Espinosa informed us you're the one who figured it out. If I hadn't, somebody else would have. I'm not so sure. We ready our file and we know who you are, Inspector Andrade. General Infantes wishes to be personally informed of our progress and we can't disappoint him. I'll do my best, sir. We hope so. If the major agrees, I'll sign an order with detailed instructions about your mission. One more thing. Sergeant Espinosa will assist you. - The sergeant? - Yes. Report to him. He'll accompany you during the mission. - Any questions? - No, sir. Dismissed. I don't get it. These four pieces are from yesterday. Right here. Good morning, Sergeant. Salute, soldier. I bring an order from Lieutenant Colonel Navajas del Rio. Very well, Inspector. I'm all ears. - I'm not a policeman anymore, sir. - You are now. Candy? They say the Bolsheviks put vitamins in them. And bromide. You want one or not? Yes, thank you. Here, sweet-tooth. Can I ask you a question, sir? Go right ahead. Why did you tell the colonel about me? You could have kept the glory for yourself. Not much glory around here. Besides, I've never been a career man. The last thing I wanted was to get involved in this mess. But here we are. Have you studied the reports? The victim was Second Lieutenant Luis del Aguila. 6th company, 2nd battalion of the 282nd. He'd enlisted... in Valencia. What else? He'd been dead over 15 hours when we found him. We think they slit his throat at the lake, but there was no blood on the body, which is very odd. Where do we start? I'll talk to the doctor who did the autopsy. Check his things and find out who he hung out with and how the news has affected his company. To rule out suspects. How many are there? The Division has 18,000 soldiers. That's a great start. He died from a horizontal cut made from left to right with a very sharp knife. I doubt he had time to scream because his vocal chords and windpipe were severed. With his arteries cut, the blood loss was massive and he died instantly. How could the blood have disappeared? The missing blood only means he was killed somewhere else. Yeah, but his uniform was clean. Unless he was naked when they knifed him. Have you seen anyone naked since you got here? Maybe they forced him to take off his uniform. And just sit there like a rabbit? It's possible. Anything's possible, until we prove otherwise. Why do you think he just sat there? No cuts on his forearms. That indicates he didn't put up a fight. The killer probably attacked him from behind. Because of the angle. That's pretty cold-blooded. Anywhere else, I don't know. But here, it could be anyone. I'll be right there. "God is watching." What could that be? Nothing good. Anything else? Marks, prints... Only the wound that killed him. Though this might help. No abrasions. That means he was moved. Not dragged? To be exact. That wasn't in the report, Captain. Excuse me. Captain! Was the body clean or dirty? - What? - Luis del Aguila's body. Was it clean or dirty? Clean, clean! What? Your mother. Where is she? Pisat, piss. You want to pee? What's wrong, it won't come out? Your father? Where is your father? Think we'll put out the fire? Come in. If I may. It's almost 90 degrees. It's boiling! Good morning, Sergeant. Coffee? Sure. I see they got you a real place. As you can see, I'm climbing the social ladder. Did you hear the Russians took Stalingrad? - Things aren't looking good. - You think so? Positioning on the front isn't what matters. The Poles lasted 20 days. The French a month. Yeah, but Russia's too big and we're in deep shit. You know what our problem is? Traitors. Why else would we be getting bombed? Spies? Something like that. Is that official? It's just a rumor that's going around. Damn, this ulcer is killing me! Luis del Aguila. What do we know about him? Luis del Aguila. Quite a character. Nobody knew him well, but everybody shared their sardines with him. His last day... he ate at the canteen, wrote letters in the afternoon... and took a shower that night. That's all we know for sure. That he took his last shower four days ago. So there was no more reason to kill him than to leave him alive. - Any family? - Yeah. His parents and a sister in Valencia. By the way... A letter from his sister. Thanks. In the report it says he drank. Like a fish. And he was always buying everybody drinks. Damn. - That means cash. - Yeah. - A soldier's pay won't cover it. - There's an explanation. Gambling. That's where he got the cash. - Card games? - No. Not exactly cards. He played roulette. Holy shit. - I thought they were just rumors. - They're not. They're playing it all the time and someone's looking the other way. And it's everybody, not just the Spaniards. But it'll be hard to get in because they don't want anybody blowing the whistle. I understand. Let's talk to the shower attendant. Fine by me. Actually I could use a shower. What about "God is watching?" - Do we know anything? - Nothing solid. I was thinking about it earlier. Luis del Aguila could be an atheist-communist infiltrator. "God is watching" sounds like a warning. To him and other collaborators. Any data to support this hypothesis? Yeah, I heard he talked to a priest a lot. And the sister mentions it in the letter. Well, then? Fifth columnists usually overact, to avoid suspicion. Then we'll cast our nets there. Goddamn it! - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Who would leave a beast like that here? He's training to identify partisans! Fucking piece of shit faggot. Go to fucking hell! - You should go to the infirmary. - No, it was just a scare. The 27th? That was the night the horses got out. They scared the hell out of me. It was really foggy. Like the devil himself. What time was that? Around eight, just after they closed. They close the barracks? Yeah, when we finish. You mean after you leave nobody can go in or out. You never know, but I'd say no. That night... did anybody come in? - Yeah, one guy. - Is this him? Yeah. Anybody else go in? Well... Well, no. You were here the whole time? Not the whole time. What do you mean? I went to the bathroom. Let's get one thing straight. The general would like to resolve this matter as soon as possible. You were the last person to see Luis del Aguila alive and as far as I'm concerned you're first on my list, got it? I didn't do anything. You had plenty of time. Something tells me he died in one of these showers. Private, what's going on? My balls are freezing! Hey... Don't hey me! I'm a staff sergeant! Sorry, Sergeant, sir. The pipes freeze at night. The water doesn't reach all the showers at this hour. Next time tell me before I freeze to death. How long were you gone? Not long, 20 minutes. - That's not long? - Not long he says. Was he still in the shower when you got back? - No, he'd left. - Okay. How long after that did the horses get out? About 20 minutes, half an hour... - 45 minutes tops. - You're in deep shit. Sergeant, look around the stables for me. And see if we can find out more about the roulette. I'll try to get a pass to Headquarters. As long as I'm here, I could use a shower. "My dearest little brother, At home everyone is fine. Mom and Dad think of you every day. You can't imagine how happy your letters make them. We got the money you sent, which is a lot. Don't send anymore because you'll run out of fuel. When you say you can't find the remedy for your suffering, there's nothing I can do. Except encourage you to trust in God. He weighs and measures. You say you're talking to the priest about it. I think he can put you on the right track. And pray, that will help you. I enclosed the photo we took before you enlisted. Come on, send a new one. We want to see how you look. I love you and think of you often, your kid sister." - Fucking dog! Tired yet? - Having fun? Just doing a little training, sir. - You hear the news? - No. What happened? They caught a spy. They caught a prisoner with photos and maps of the area. That's great. Though he won't be the last. I hope not. The more we catch the better. Even the mosquitoes are Reds here. And the car? They're fixing it up. Here, get on. We'll freeze our balls off. We think the victim sent a letter which might have clues. We need to know if it exists and if you've got it. We also need to check all the mail for references to the victim. To inspect mail I need an order from Major Zarauza. You can't use my order? The Mail Office depends on information. Can't we fix things later? We're in a rush. No. I understand. You're right, Sergeant. Procedure must be followed. Could I use your telephone? Just what I needed. I heard you had arrived. Have you seen Colonel Navajas? Not yet, sir. Estrada, step outside for a moment. We're not to be disturbed. I have something to tell you, Arturo. You see... You know that there are classes in this world. Even among dead people, you understand? Yes, sir. Luis del Aguila was a soldier. But he was also a Falangist. A good Falangist. And you'll agree we're the backbone of the Division. Without a doubt. By that I mean that if it were up to me, it would be my people investigating this. I understand. That doesn't mean Colonel Navajas won't do everything he can. But you can count on me for anything you need. I'm very grateful, sir. We need to speed up the process with the letters. You haven't spoken with Sergeant Estrada? Apparently I need your approval. Well, you have it. You might tell him to check for any favorable reference to the Communists. Why? Because of the phrase: "God is watching." It's something we're looking into. For what reason? Luis del Aguila might not have been as Christian as he seemed. He may have been collaborating with the Communists. That's a serious accusation. Right now it's only a hypothesis. I hope it doesn't get out. Unless it's something very solid. Don't worry, it won't get out. Gentlemen, this is Private Arturo Andrade. He's investigating Luis del Aguila's death. We need to find a letter to Erundina del Aguila written by the deceased. Or any other letter that mentions him. Okay. - I leave you in good hands. - Excuse me, sir. Did the major mention I also need any letters with... Yes, he did. Don't worry. We always filter out those letters anyway. - Very well. - If you'll excuse me. Sergeant Estrada will find whatever you need. He works better than a Swiss watch. He went from a civilian to a sergeant in 6 months. Goodbye. Listen, don't say a word to anyone about this. We're throwing a party tonight. A mujik let us borrow his place. We invited some panienkas. You know women here. If you're nice, they go all the way. We're pooling our money. How about it? I just wired money to Spain. I'm broke, Corporal. Don't worry about it, I'll cover you. All this time fighting Marx and it turns out the bastard was right. Why's that? "Economic conditions determine everything." It's a joke. Jokes like that have filled cemeteries. By the way, I want to show you something after. - Who's the officer? - Major Isart. - You don't know him? - A real number. If you see him coming, cross the street. He erases people off the map. He's stationed in Pushkin, but sometimes shows up around here. The Russian must be the spy. And the other guy? Last week they indicted a guy for faking an accident. It must be him. He shot himself in the hand to get sent back to Spain. On your feet, soldier! I said on your feet! Jesus, they're brothers. Ready! Aim! Fire! You don't look well. Are you okay? No. No, sir. I don't feel well at all. Are we still on for later? Sure we are! Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh what fun... Enough Christmas carols! Get back to work! - I'll teach you a lesson. - You're just scared. Anything in the stables? The soldiers on duty said one of the horses got spooked and kicked the gate open. But I had a look around and didn't see anything. No dents or marks on the gate. - They were probably sleeping. - Yeah, sleeping off their hangovers with the shower attendant. There's more. This could interest you. Luis del Aguila's horse... I mean, the one they used to move him. It wasn't a horse, it was a mare. And the others were stallions. So? The murderer only wanted one, he didn't mean to spook them all and send them running like crazy. Women have that effect sometimes. Now he was a drinker... The guy killed at the lake. What was his name again? Luis del Aguila. Yeah, he drank like a sponge. That's him. Was he a friend of yours? No, he had no friends. Unless you count the priest. He liked priests? He was always with Father Ramon. I'll tell you what. If he drank and confessed a lot, he felt guilty about something. Now that you mention it, he was a sly one. "God is watching." - What's that? - Bastos. You have no idea what it might mean? More Bastos. "Watching over all men." - Excuse me? - The childhood prayer. "God is watching, watching over all men. You have to die someday, you'll never know when." What are you talking about? What am I talking about, he asks! - The panienkas are taking forever. - Take it easy. - The Ruskie went to find them. - It's been two hours. - You think they'll give us blowjobs? - Without even asking. Like French girls! - He speaks Russian! - Just enough to pick up girls. Take it easy! Did you guys hear that? On your toes. You heard the sergeant! Get your rifles ready! The place is swarming with Ruskies. We need to get out of here. Disperse one by one. Nobody fires a shot until I give the word. You're going first. - What did he say? - You! - Get moving! - Why me? Come on, get moving! - I always go first! - Faustino! Don't shit in your pants. - Fuck you! - Let's go! Where are you going? He'll be right back. Did you see his face? You bastards! We'll have to change your pants! They're here! Ladies... Welcome. It's freezing! Pretty ladies! Get inside, it's cold. Blondie! I don't understand a single word you're saying. Damn... You guys aren't cold? Okay, okay. I got it. I've been thinking about that prayer. "God is watching, watching over all men..." How does it go? "You have to die someday..." "...you'll never know when." What were you thinking? It has four verses. That could mean three more murders. Let's go. Careful. We don't want another accident. - Thank you, Father. - You're welcome. We'd like to ask you a few questions. We'd better speak inside. Yes, sir. Luis was a good Christian. A zealous follower of the rules of the Church. Did he confess often? The things we carry inside can easily turn bitter, but... what he said in confession is secret. It's a sacrament that cannot be violated. You know that. Yes, of course. But can't we request an? A dispensation. A church dispensation? That would have to come from the Pope himself. - No exceptions? - No. With capital sins there are no exceptions. Capital... I understand. Did he ever say anything outside of confession? We think the murderer could be somebody close to him. Actually he didn't say much. He was very reserved. The other soldiers didn't think much of him. Every regiment has a kid who has trouble making friends. Timid. But they say he was helping the Bolsheviks. Oh, please! Luis was a good Christian. He knew his country was being prostituted by Marxism, that's why he came here. To carry God's revenge on the tip of his bayonet. A good Christian, of course. A good Christian. Though I hear he played roulette. Isn't that right? And that's a mortal sin, isn't it, Father? I repeat, anything the deceased, God rest his soul, revealed to me, is between God and him. - I forgive in His name. - How many times, Father? How many times can you forgive the same sin? - What do you know about sin? - The same as you. I face it every... You know nothing about sin! I imagine you never had to interrogate a priest before. Actually, I did a few times. When? What year did you work for the police? Do you know that rascal? Yeah, we've peed together a few times. After that spanking he won't be able to sit down. How sweet. WATCHING OVER ALL MEN See that stain on his knee? It's from his heart. The murderer ripped it out and put it on his leg. What happened? It got eaten. Must have been an animal. No, it was one of the residents. - Residents? - Yeah. This place hasn't been a monastery for some time. The Ruskie said it used to be an old Teutonic fortress, but now it's a lunatic asylum. The Russians took off and left the lunatics here to fend for themselves. One of them ate this poor guy's heart. - Cannibalism? - Hunger. What do you think? The murderer brought him to the monastery at gunpoint. Yeah, I think so too. And I think he wanted to bring Luis del Aguila but something went wrong. We should setup a patrol in case he tries again. II. WATCHING OVER ALL MEN - Good morning. - Come in. Arturo Andrade. You don't look familiar. - You can't know the whole Division. - Yes, you can. Everybody who takes a photo. For example, you haven't taken one. I'm not photogenic. Your photos are drying. They'll be ready in a moment. Very well. I don't know if the whole Division is here, but almost. I've photographed almost everyone, or developed photos of them. I make a copy of every photo that comes in. It may seem silly, but who says it won't help humanity someday. Look, I have these too. Taken by an officer who likes photography. I develop them for him. They're good because they're not posed. Photography should be a recording of reality, not a representation. Look at that one. You see? Does the subject interest you? I have an album I made, I can show it to you. I'm very interested but right now I'd rather... - Yes, of course. - Thank you. Come with me. I've been thinking about those murdered soldiers. You know why? Something happened to me in '35. I was working for the ABC newspaper, when it was a left wing newspaper. And I was sent to photograph a cadaver. His head had been cut off. His eyes were slit, with crystalline dripping out. Everything was clean, with barely any blood. - A lot like these guys. - Where was that? In Barcelona. I was taking photos and two guys in suits showed up, sent us all home, ordered the police to clear the street and took my film away. It wasn't in the paper the next day. It might not be the same killer, but it could be the same people. Even a Masonic ritual or something like that. Here. If you say you're not photogenic, you just haven't found - the right photographer. - Excuse me? You'll look great. - You can send it to your family. - Thank you. You're welcome. Agustin Covisa Calero. He had a spotless record. Did he join in Madrid? Yes, and he was one of ours. You mean not a Falangist? That's exactly what I mean, soldier. This will get everyone dirty. Has the investigation made any progress? Well, we know how and where he was killed. But to find the killer, we still need to find the motive. So we're missing what matters most. The only damn thing that matters. They say Luis del Aguila played roulette. Know anything? It's forbidden. Rumor has it they're playing. I don't care, it's forbidden. Is that all you have? We have a lead that would link the crimes to Freemasonry. Well, there's a Freemason in Pushkin. The devil himself. Ricardo Guerra Castell, alias Guerrita. A real gem. A Freemason, a Chekist and a homo. The whole package. He ran a prison and worked undercover for Military Intel, but this poof has done worse things than that. He organized the Talion Plan. - Why hasn't he been executed? - Ask him. Franco himself pardoned him and sent him here with specific orders to hide his identity in case somebody wants to kill him. That's odd. Extremely. Especially knowing Franco. He always goes so out of his way to weed out the bad ones. But... if you want to see him in action, you'd better hurry up. We've got him clearing anti-personnel mines. He could blow up any time. You guys okay? Comfortable? The day I die, I fit ever happens. I'll be killed by grief, not by weapons. The day I die, I fit ever happens. I'll be killed by grief, not by weapons. I was born on a dark night, no moon or stars I could find. Everywhere I go, weapons follow behind. Took long enough. - What took long enough? - You killing me. You think that's why I'm here? You're wrong. I have some questions about two dead soldiers. Luis del Aguila and Agustin Covisa. Soldier. You're not here because of who I am? No. But I'm curious why you weren't executed. If you tried to murder General Franco. I was a fifth columnist since the war started. I tipped off his security detail. And you don't regret anything you've done? For every comrade I lost, ten Reds were killed. How many lives is General Franco worth? Luis del Aguila. Do you know him? Never heard of him. - But you know what happened. - No. He was murdered in Molevo. People die every day. I've heard it all before. But this guy was killed by one of ours. Very possibly a Freemason. Where were you the night of January 27th? Here, on duty. I haven't left Pushkin in a month. Right. Do you know this guy? No. I suppose you'll say you were on duty yesterday - around noon as well. - No. I was having sex. So you have a witness. Who is she? I could give you his name and company. But he might deny it. He's an officer. An officer? I promise maximum discretion. I know you Freemasons have a lot of secrets. But I have information. Not a lot, just enough to know if you're lying or telling the truth. First you have to promise not to hang me out to dry. That depends on what you tell me. What do you want to know? If these crimes are related to Freemasonry. That's easy. Yes. Masonic rituals were followed. The first was executed following the 1st degree ritual. And the other the 2nd degree. Does that mean the soldiers were Freemasons? Or they picked on a Freemason. Right. - How many could the Division have? - No idea. But remember they weren't only Reds. There were plenty of officers as well. They're persecuted now, but before the uprising we were all on the same side. Yeah, I know. "God is watching." Ring any bells? Yes or no? No. Okay, then we're finished. - Cigarette? - No. But a swig of cognac would be nice. I hope you respect our deal. You'll have to trust me. So will you. Life is unpredictable. I just wanted you to know. I could kill you right here. I wouldn't do that. One wrong step and boom. All you have to do is walk straight towards me. If I were the killer, you wouldn't have left here alive. You were lying. There are no mines here. - Freemasons? - Yeah. So we can forget the Civil War? Yeah, I think so. What do we know about Covisa? Not much. He was popular, a joker, well-considered, a normal drinker and no weird affinities, unlike Luis del Aguila. Was he nervous? Did anyone notice any strange behavior? Nobody noticed anything. If he had any relationship with Luis del Aguila, he would have been nervous. He didn't have any. The priest? Any link to the priest? Nothing. Right. - Toffee? - Wow, toffee! Here, for your ulcer. Where would I be without it? By the way, I almost forgot. Roulette. Don't make any plans tomorrow, we're playing. You got us in! We'll be there. God willing. Are you okay? You're more handsome in person. Arturo! Arturo, soldier! Good morning! Did you hear about what happened last night? No, what happened? Two partisans raped one of the panienkas from the other night. Which one? I don't know. I was going to ask if she was yours. The Ruskies don't like anybody touching their women. Hey, why the long face? You're not in love, are you? No, sir! Sergeant Estrada? He stepped out. Any news about Luis del Aguila's letter? I think the sergeant set one aside this morning. Check over there. Sergeant. Thanks for handling the letter. Your men just gave it to me. Well, they shouldn't have. I'm very grateful. If you find any mail for Agustin Covisa... Yeah, we're on it. Anything else? Yes. Apparently the crimes are related to Freemasonry. Then we're not looking for pro-Soviet agents. We still haven't ruled out any leads. I'll let you know when I find something. Did the letter turn up? Yes. I told you they'd find it. As soon as the truck is loaded, we're leaving for Mestelevo. You don't seem to be in a hurry. I have helpers today, they gave me rein for cements. I got them on loan. Somebody jumped the chain of command. I have orders to sit around. Listen to me good. The Germans may be squares, but they never jump the chain of command. Whatever we say, we have plenty to learn from them. "I'm enclosing the photo you asked for. The other guy is a good friend of mine. We call him Tiroliro. And even the Russians are scared of him." So Luis del Aguila was friends with this guy Tiroliro? Do you know him? No, but we'll be meeting him soon. He's a roulette star. Keep the letter. I think it might help. This morning at headquarters I saw you talking to Navajas del Rio. Did the colonel summon you for some reason? Look, Arturo. They put me in this mess to give you a hand. But also to supervise you. That's the truth. They wanted to make sure you were faithful to the cause and all that. We all have a past. I wouldn't be surprised if they asked you about me as well. No. They haven't asked me anything. Good. I'm glad. Look at that. Dying in a war. What's the point? My father was a soldier. He always thought he'd die fighting for Spain. He couldn't even report for duty, he was always sick. He was always in and out of the hospital. He finally died there. My mother, holding his hand. He thought he was destined for something greater. Yeah, so did I. For years I dreamed of a greater destiny for myself. But dying in a war is nothing special. Don't you think? I can't talk, sir. I can't talk here. If I make it back to Spain alive, I can't talk there either. Nobody wants to die in a war like this one. There's no point. We're all fucking dead already anyway. Silence! What do you want? To ask you about Luis del Aguila. I'm investigating his murder. He wouldn't have wanted anybody asking questions. I don't believe that. That's your problem. Agustin Covisa. Do you know him? No. Well, he would have wanted somebody to ask questions. Have you got a family? What do you care? Luis del Aguila had one. So he must have had a good reason to be playing this. And I think you know what it is. Would you please answer the question? What will you do if I don't? Shoot me? - One. - Wait. - Give me a reason not to kill you. - Wait. Wait. Wait. Let me show you something. Luis... was your friend. Two days before he came here an officer recruited Luis and three others from the Division. They drove to an apartment in Valencia. In plain clothes. All of them armed. A Freemason lived there and they had to arrest him. But the guy... wasn't there. Just his wife. They were ordered to ransack the place and to rape the wife. All of them? All of them. All four of them. Luis del Aguila, - Agustin Covisa... - No. Covisa wasn't there. Who were the other three? I've been called everything, but a snitch... But I can assure you Covisa wasn't there. Because you were, right? Luis de Aguila didn't tell you this. You were one of the four. We were following orders. - Sure. - Sure, what? You don't follow orders? You've never killed anyone in this war? We told him she was a fucking Red. That we had to follow orders. But he wouldn't do it. You think the crimes are related to Valencia? Hey, you. It's time. The Freemason you were supposed to arrest. What was his name? Forner... Ferrer, Ferran... I don't know. I don't remember. "God is watching, watching over all men." What does it mean? Bet on me. Make me some dough and I'll tell you anything you want. The name of the officer, for example. No. I told you, I won't go there. If you want a snitch, look somewhere else. Ask a Freemason. If this is revenge for Valencia, the killer will come after you. You'd better watch out. No, he'd better. Can we trust this guy? He's telling the truth. You think an army officer can give an order like that? You don't? Silence! Silence! III. YOU HAVE TO DIE SOMEDAY Good morning, Arturo. Come in. So you went to Pushkin to interrogate a suspect. Yes, Ricardo Guerra... but I don't think he's our guy. I know. Major Isart came personally to confirm his alibi. He's special so we use him for more unpleasant tasks. Clearing mines, cleaning chambers... When the murder took place Guerrita was cleaning the major's private room. Any other suspects? No. Not at the moment. I'd like to be informed of any progress. Of course. I'll send you a copy of every report. Excuse me, sir. Were these photos confiscated from the spies? Yes. - May I? - Please. Do we know where they were developed? Why? Did you develop this photo? No. Do you know where it was developed? Any laboratory could have done it. But they have the same white border as these. That can be done anywhere. Right. Okay, that's all. - Thank you very much. - If you need anything else... Oh, yes. Yesterday you said an officer brings you photos to develop. Can you tell me who? He requested discretion. - It's important. - I'm sorry, I can't tell you. I'm a man of my word. I remind you, I'm investigating two murders. And how is that related to a private photo album? Look. If you hold back information, you could get into trouble. You may be investigating this, but you're still a private. Between problems with a private and betraying an officer, I know my choice. You know what I think? I think there is no officer. I think those photos are yours. Mine? Why would I lie about it? Only you know that. On your knees! On your knees and apologize! It's your last chance! - He didn't! - Shut your mouth! - Leave him alone! - Go fuck yourself! Leave him alone! Everybody get back and shut up! Put the gun down, you bastard! You want me to kill this kid? Alexander! Alexander! Drop it. Drop it or I'll blow your fucking head off. Lower your weapon. Alexander, close your eyes. Drop it. That's enough! This is madness! Are you okay? Are you okay? Alexander! Alexander! HITLER WILL ONLY GET YOU KILLED JOIN THE GLORIOUS RUSSIAN ARMY We're Falangist volunteers. Long live the mother who had us. Long live the priest who blessed us. They would make a pharaoh proud. We're Falangist volunteers. Long live the mother who had us. Long live the priest who blessed us. They would make a pharaoh proud. Inspector! Inspector! A letter for Covisa. Like I said. He was with the Reds. They're experts at this stuff. Look at the signature. V.L.R. What do you make of it? The return address says Victor Lopez Rodriguez. No way. It looks like a fake name. Why would he sign with initials? Why? Because you sign with your name. Besides, the initials: V.L.R. "Long live the Republic", in Spanish. It's a message in code. The blood is the Reds. Look closely. When he talks about his mother, it's Russia. The initials, everything. This whole thing is a disaster. He mentions a concentration of 40,000 Russians. 3 to 1. They're coming for us and here we are, surrounded by traitors! What now? Should we forget Valencia and follow the Civil War lead? No, I still think this is related to Valencia. You still think Valencia is solid? Listen. A Freemason lived there. The killer is following Masonic rituals. He takes the victims to the monastery in Molevo, which used to be a Teutonic fortress. His wife was raped by four soldiers, and the prayer has four verses, Sergeant. But if the guy wasn't there, how can he recognize the soldiers? I have a theory about that. Listen. Go ahead. Someone's been taking photos of the whole Division, right? Yes. An officer, the photographer said. Maybe he loves photography, but I don't think that's why. I think he's our guy and he's sending the photos to his wife so she can identify them and tell him who they are. Damn! And how do the Reds fit into all this? I don't know. We still have to find that out. No, no. There's a detail you're forgetting. Covisa enlisted in Madrid. He couldn't have been in Valencia. Okay, okay. They cornered him in Molevo! What? They cornered him in Molevo! They're up there. - Where? - Up there. Inside? Corporal, wait for us here. All right. It's the same. Radio for reinforcements. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I want him alive, got it? You hear me? My name is Arturo Andrade! It's over, understand? You're surrounded! We know everything! The Masonic rituals, the punishments, the murder in the showers! You'll get a fair trial, I promise! But it's over. Freeze! Don't move. Freeze. We also know what happened in Valencia! To your wife! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I said something he didn't like at all. Lower your weapons. Lower your weapons! Bring in the machine gun! Fire! Halt! He's getting away. This is nothing, sir. You'll be back with your family in a week. He fixed my ulcer. Come on, you'll be fine. Listen, you'll be fine. Come on. Come on, sir. Goddamn it. - Mail. - Come in. I'm just leaving you this. - What is it? - The report on the last victim. Wait, don't leave. What's wrong? - Any mail for headquarters? - Yeah, a truck full. He enlisted in Valencia. I need you to do me a favor. Come on. The handwriting is odd. Like somebody right-handed wrote it with their left hand. I need another letter to compare it with this one. I could get screwed for opening mail. Nobody will find out, sir. Besides, anything for Agustin Covisa would be sent to me anyway. Just like this one. Okay. Arturo! Did you hear that? The Russians have reached Petrovskaya. There can't be anybody left. Are you listening? Did you find it? No! Arturo! Arturo! - Arturo, are you all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Are you okay? - Yes. We were lucky. There's a letter from your wife. Your real name is Ferrer, isn't it? Drop your gun, you bastard. Can I have the letter? Your wife made a mistake. The second soldier, Agustin Covisa. The kid had nothing to do with it. But he looked just like one of the guys who did. The one called Tiroliro. He already did your job for you. Why didn't you shoot me at the monastery? Because you didn't do anything wrong. I'm sorry about your friend. I didn't mean to kill him. I honestly never thought I'd get caught. You thought I'd fall for the coded message. You wrote it to throw off the investigation. Even if you figured it out, that didn't matter either. Because I'd find the real culprit behind all this. The four soldiers were just tools. The real culprit gave the order. I don't know who it is. I don't know. He never showed his face. You... You could help me find him. I don't know either. But you're wrong if you think I'd help a criminal. You think you're better than me? You aren't. My wife... was raped by four men. On orders from a coward who never showed his face. You know what that did to Teresa? She never recovered. Months in a hospital... Psychiatrists... She was never the same. What I did was avenge a crime. And you'd have done the same, if you were a man. No, I wouldn't have. That's easy to say. We're all good men until the right bastard comes along. If it's any consolation, Luis del Aguila was very sorry for what he did. "God is watching." What's the relation to Masonic rituals? It has nothing to do with the rituals. It's a prayer for children. Teresa repeated it over and over again. Over and over, while those animals were beating her... I wanted them to never forget it. Important documents in back. Put the vases on top. Three of these are missing. Come on, let's go! Did you find the killer? What made you think Sergeant Estrada was the killer? Sergeant Estrada? I thought his name was Ferrer. Where'd you learn to speak Russian? I speak a little of everything. Private... YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHEN Subtitles by Innominabilis
