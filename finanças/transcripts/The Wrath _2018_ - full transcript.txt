No! "The wrath" Hurry! Let's go. Thank you for everything. Where will you go, sir? I should take the state exam, and must uphold my family. That is only possible if you are healthy and well, sir. With the demon slayer, what have I to fear? A nobleman like you searched through a humble monk's quarters? I heard this sword destroyed countless evil ghosts. To you, it's just a piece of steel. Buddha did not allow you that. Please return it, sir. I will pay you well for it. Let's go. Yeon-du! Yeon-du! Madam? We've arrived. Madam? We've arrived. Let's go. Young master! You came without notice, sir? Must I give notice to return to my own home? I apologize, sir. Is she a new maid? Well, she'll be the youngest daughter-in-law... She's to wed yeon-du tonight, sir. Did you tell him anything? Of course not. I said that our kind madam found a wife for him. How is the bride for yeon-du you brought today? What do you think? She's an orphan with nowhere to go. She's lucky to even step foot in this house. Instead of being on the street, she has a place to sleep. That's true. What in the world! I'll sleep with the bride tonight. Impossible! Avoiding it won't solve this. I bought the girl for you. And yeon-du is set to die for his master. I planned this all for you. Though yeon-du may pretend to be me, the evil spirit will know. Still, 1 forbid you. You mustn't die like your brothers on the wedding night. You must carry on the family line! Are you worried about me? Or afraid the family will be ruined if I die? Myung-kyu. How could you ask that? Though I'm not your birth mother, I care about this family as much as your late mother. And so, you tried to take my father's place in his absence? I'll destroy the evil spirit with this sword tonight. If you insist, I'll oblige. However, I won't have you sleep with a humble girl. Give me some time, I'll find a noble lady to... Unnecessary. I don't think of her as my bride. She is just bait to lure in the evil spirit. Goodness! All washed and clean, you look like a noble lady! But what's this? It's a burn from childhood. Really? On a pretty girl like you... What am I saying? You're the youngest daughter-in-law now. Forgive me, ma'am. She looks beautiful now, ma'am. She looks weak on the outside, but has a firm, strong body. She could get pregnant tonight. Who asked you about the humble girl's body? Forgive me, ma'am. Leave us. Yes, ma'am. She just said what she saw. Why get so angry? But mother, what she said is indecent. But it wasn't useless. If she gets pregnant, we should be so thankful. Are you blaming us for not getting pregnant? Of course not. I just wish for a son to carry on the family line. Let's pray to Buddha for myung-kyu's safety. Wicked wench! Show yourself now! Sir! That's enough. Does Buddha not have the power to get rid of a ghost? We shall cut ties with the temple. Please leave here at once! Leave this house. No need to carry a bitter load any longer. Forget everything you saw here, and live like the grass in a field. Be careful! Send the girl away, mother. A noble lady must remain chaste to her husband. But a humble girl like her can just remarry. I shall send her away after 100 days. Why 100 days? The monk promised to pray for us for 100 days. Until he is done, he said not to send the girl away. You must follow 3 rules in this house. First, do not leave this house without my permission. Second, no one died in this house. Thus, do not wear mourning robes or tell anyone anything. And lastly, do not go near or even look at the storehouse. If you disobey any of these rules, you will be punished! Yes, ma'am. How clever of mother. Do you know what 100 days mean? You can tell if a woman is pregnant in 100 days. Cunning, isn't it? Beware of that lowly girl, too. She could be trouble. If she's pregnant, she'll try to rule over us. I haven't seen your husband for so long. I must apologize. He's bedridden from an illness. I hope he feels well, soon. Without him in the court for support, my husband is quite anxious. Will your youngest son take the state exam? Is he still at the temple? Yes. Madam, I've brought refreshments. Come in. I haven't seen her before. She's a new maid, ma'am. Really? What a comely face for a servant. How dare you! What have you done to the lady! I deserve to die, ma'am! Silence! - I will have your head! - No need. It wasn't on purpose. No, madam, she should be punished! Congratulations, madam. She's pregnant. I sense her blood is full of vitality. I'm sure she'll give birth to a son. Myung-kyu... He fulfilled his duty... That wicked wench. Move into the main house, now. And stop doing chores. But madam, I can still do... How dare you go against my orders? As you command, madam. I'm grateful for your mercy. It's not for your humble soul. You're but a surrogate. Remember that. Yes, ma'am. Yeon-du? Do it right! The lady and baby are both well, madam. Are you certain? When pregnant, the body changes and can disrupt the mind to have nightmares. She'll feel better soon, madam. Of course, she should. I heard you're the top exorcist in the country. You flatter me, ma'am. I just try to make reason of the world. What brings you to my humble abode, madam? Bi-ryu? Are you alright? Madam? Tell me about the woes here. Everything. I trust you'll keep everything I said a secret. If you don't, you will suffer loss, too. Of course, madam. So, can you destroy the curse on our family? Don't try to destroy it, but console it. Perhaps your devoted prayers will wane the anger. Console the ghost? I didn't think of that. Madam? May I meet your youngest daughter-in-law? What about her? I heard she's pregnant. I'll make her a protection amulet. Ma'am? Please listen to me carefully. This house no longer belongs to the living. A devil's house is neither grave nor hell. Nothing can fight it. This evil spirit will go after you and your unborn child. My baby? However, you were born with strong divine powers. That sign is the proof. Thus, the ghost can't harm you easily. You must leave this house in secret at once. If you need help, I will assist. How could I do that? I'm having my husband's baby. It would be wrong for me to leave. If you stay, you'll face an endless battle. Don't accept a fate that you can avoid. We do not accept fate, we choose them. I've been through all kinds of hardships. I was just a weak woman. But being pregnant, I realized I was wrong. I realized that life means power. Power? Who knows? Perhaps this baby will rule this house and the world. You have high ambitions. This baby gave me that, too. Tell me, what should I do? We must console the evil spirit at its grave. You must pray with all your heart, too. Madam! Why are you awake so early? Madam! But how... Don't look like you've seen a ghost. I've always wanted to make a meal for the household. I'll make breakfast today. You can just assist. But madam, how dare we... Go on. Start the fire. Yes, ma'am! You've suffered enough. Due to the evil spirit's atrocities, I've been hard-hearted. Dear daughters-in-law. Forgive me if I've hurt you in anyway. Of course, you haven't mother. Youngest, dear? You must've been hurt by my lack of virtue. I was mean and hurt you so. No, madam. Call me mother. You're my daughter-in-law. The worst has happened... Keys? They're for the storehouse. Mother? Why give me these? You're family now. You should know what's in there. Could you go and bring me a persimmon? I'm craving something sweet. I'll bring it right away. Oh, there's a small door inside the storehouse. It's to the ancestral shrine. It's off limits. Don't open the door. Yes, mother. Is... someone there? Help... me. Help... me... please. What have you done? Mother... I warned you not to open this door! Forgive me. I deserve to die. Silence! You will pay for going against your mother-in-law and... Dear? Sir! I don't believe it. Is it really you, my dear? You've gained your senses! Sir! After our first and second sons died, he lost his mind from the shock. So we kept it a secret, and had to hide him there. But heaven helped us. You saved him! I've lost myung-kyu, too? It's because I'm cursed. A man of many sins like me should've died first! Do not fret, sir. I'm sure myung-kyu went to a better place, too. And his bride brought us much good. Thank you. You saved our family. You're quite surprising. How'd you bring father back to normal? Are you a shaman by chance? No. Really? Then tell me your intentions. If you have a son and stay, do you plan to be the head of this household? Sister. How dare you! I'm not your sister-in-law! Listen closely. No matter what you're planning, you can't fool me. If you continue with your crafty ways, I'll punish you and your baby! Though you are drunk, please watch what you say. What? If anyone tries to hurt my child, I won't just stand and watch. A mother must protect her child. What do you mean? Just as I said, sir. I'm pregnant with your baby. So, what is it that you want? I just want to be the head mistress of your house. Who's to say the baby is mine? You're a courtesan who serves many men! I've kept my fidelity only to you, sir. Silence! If you say anything again, you will face certain death. Ministers Kim, Lee, and park... If your secret talks here are revealed in court, what would happen? Why you...! Trying to enthrone a new king is high treason, sir. How dare you! If you listen to my earnest plea, I'll take the secret to my grave. Deal with her quietly. Say you'll take her to a doctor, and bring her out. Treat her with respect, so she won't be suspicious. Yes, sir. I'll torture her to find out who else she has told. I'll interrogate her myself. Take her to gap-po. Ma'am! Ma'am? You have a guest. What do you mean, sir? I'm not sure why, but she must have a plan. I don't believe it, sir. Mother? Stranger things will occur. First, livestock will die. A ghost possessing a body can't survive on human food. She will feast on living blood. Leave this house at once. I can't do that. You won't give up your ambitions? Your life is at risk! Ambition or greed, it doesn't matter what you say. I'm a daughter-in-law of the house who is with child. I don't mind returning to a maid as long as I can protect my baby. If you stay here, you and your baby will get hurt! Also, if the baby is born in this house, it could bring disaster here and to the country. I'll fight with all my might to stop that from happening. It must be a dream. It's a nightmare! What was that? I'll ask you again. Who did you tell the secret to? I didn't tell anyone. Please, sir. Why would I betray you? Why you! Gap-po! Will you still deny it? It's the truth, sir. Please... Please have mercy... You've lied in many men's arms! What truth! If you won't confess, I shall rip you to shreds! Gap-po! Sir... please... Please spare me my life. If you do, I'll run far away with the baby. And I'll raise your baby well with all my heart. You stubborn wench! How dare you say it's mine and deceive me! Now, the baby is no more! Don't blame me. Your rash acts brought this on you! Damn bastard! I'll get my revenge! I'll kill all your sons! I'll stain every corner of your house with blood! Dear! No... No! Why! How can this happen! Don't go, sir! I must try everything I can! I'll destroy that wench's ghost once and for all! - Let's go! - Yes, sir. Dig up wol-a's grave. What now, dear? You must stay focused, sir. Remove the corpses at once! Yes, madam. Let's go inside. What's the matter, dear? It's nothing, sir. Congratulations, mother. A son and a grandson at the same time? I was unable to bear children due to a serious illness. But heaven has given us a miracle. It is all thanks to you. I feared we'd have no heir if something should happen to you. What a relief. If something happens to you, I'm here. If something happens to me, you're here. Mother? That is ominous. Did I upset you, dear? No, mother. Why are you laughing? Your trickery may come to naught. You may become much like us. If you and mother both have sons, who will be the head of this family? Mother's son, of course! He will carry on the family line and inherit everything. And your child? He will mean nothing. I hope you give birth to a son, dear. I will, sir. She's with child but myung-kyu didn't officially get married to her. And she's of humble birth. That troubled me, too. If you have a son, I plan to oust her no matter what. She doesn't belong in our family. If we just let her go, she may spread rumors about us. Then what should we do? She wants to bury her bones here. Let's give her what she wants. That wench! Halt! Have you lost your mind? How dare you ignore us! I'm sorry. I was lost in thought. Thinking of cunning ways to stay here? How dare you! Are you a shaman or something? What? Why do you talk as if you know my thoughts? Rather than insult me, be a noble lady and stop your vile slander. How dare you! I am with child. How could you behave so atrociously? If you try to hurt me again, I will tell mother. It's even more dangerous now. The evil spirit is pregnant. You and your baby are no longer safe. I'll go where wol-a was killed, and offer a sacrifice. You must prepare, too. You mean leave this house now? You're already late. Even if you leave, she'll chase after you. Our only choice now is to destroy wol-a directly. That amulet can hide you from the evil ghost. When in danger, hold it out. And this knife will kill the ghost for good. To do that, you must find madam shin's real body that the ghost hid. You must stab wol-a's neck when she's out of madam's body. Where will I find mother's body? It's hidden somewhere inside the house. As the ghost is strong, the corpse must be close by. Take that first. If you do as I say, I'll see to a post in court for you. Thank you, ma'am. Can you do it tonight? Are you in a hurry, ma'am? I kept patient long enough. The lowly girl and mother must die! Sir? I made some noodles. Thank you. I was feeling hungry. Why? Don't you like it, sir? Well... It tastes somewhat bitter. Dear... I feel... I feel strange. I sense something unholy in the air. The evil ghost must be at large again. The evil ghost? The evil ghost is in this house. You must destroy it now! That evil wench! I'll get that evil ghost myself! You wench! Where are you! Reveal yourself at once! You wench! Sir! Wol-a, you wench! Why aren't you dead! Oh no... How could this be... Dear? How does it feel to have their blood on your hands? It was you! You cursed us! I'm not done with you! Please... Spare my life... please... I said that before you killed me. Now, you're saying it? How amusing! That damn exorcist! Do you really think you can get to me? You've killed more than enough for revenge. What more do you want? What do I want? Is there an end to human greed? You're not human. You've defied the order of the spiritual world! No... is what you want... At last, you understand? Impossible! I won't let an evil ghost destroy the world! This is no place for you to hide! Reveal yourself at once! Must you do this? You don't know my anguish! I can't move on unless I get revenge! I will never forgive! Your paltry vengeance can't endanger the world! Paltry vengeance? How dare you! Wol-a... Now, meet your doom! The one to die... Will not be... me. How dare you! Leave that body and return to the afterlife! Do you think this is over? When you gain everything, you lose everything. The only thing lost will be you! Please... Go and rest in peace. You don't look well, sir. It was a hard battle. I'm lucky I survived. I'm so thankful. What will you do now? Will you leave this place? First, I'll offer sacrifices, then think of what to do. When you gain everything, you lose everything.
