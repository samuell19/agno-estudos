Hello, sir. Hello, I'm with Estelle. Ah. She's right this way. Estelle? I'm Brian. Don't tell me I'm late. I am never late. No, no. I'm early. Oh, I see. Yes. Well, I'll tell you the truth, I walked around the place a couple of times. Butterflies in my tummy. Ah. Vodka martini. Oh! Not driving then? No, no. My grandson's picking me up. Stephen. - Ah. - Mm-hm. Is he your only grandchild? Yes. The only one. He's all I've got left. You've got a son, I remember. Yes. Robert. He lives in Australia. My Harriet has been gone for three years now, and your husband, Alasdair... Alasdair. That's right. Yes, a year. So, tell me, have you done this a lot? Met people on the computer service? Yes. I have. Don't you find it's always the same? You mean the anticipation followed by the letdown? Though we never say it, of course. "If you'd only described yourself, shall we say, more accurately, we could have avoided wasting all this time and energy, which, at our stage in life, we cannot afford to do." I believe it's the system for mismatching the delusional with the hopeless. But I tell myself, "Brace up. Be positive. This time it will be different." You know, so do I. I am the eternal optimist. I thought as much. Which is why I must now confess to you a deception on my part. What I deplore most in life is dishonesty. My name is, in fact, not Brian. It's Roy. Roy Courtnay. Oh, I see. Well, I suppose now's the time that I tell you that my name actually isn't Estelle. Well, only if it isn't. It's not. It's Betty. Betty McLeish. Betty. Oh, I think I can handle that. Hello, Betty. Is that your grandson? Yeah. He's been waiting. Can we give you a lift home? What? Oh, no, no. It's just a nip across to the station, a quick walk from Paddington, and Bob's your uncle. So, au revoir, Betty. Until next time, Roy. Will you call? Go to Stringfellows, please. Thank you, sir. Follow me, please. I'm sorry to hold you up. Unavoidably detained. How old was she? Old enough. Now we'll have champagne all around. Thank you. I was just explaining the rules. As a precaution, no names. The two of us have made a good deal of money in the past, which is why I thought to give you the opportunity to buy into this new investment group. Yes. I have made, quite recently, the acquaintance of certain gentlemen, who have £800,000 to invest. They know me as a banker, slightly bent, who has guaranteed them a quick doubling of their money if they invest it in the limited partnership. Which would be us. But before they put their money in, they want to see us put some money in. Only 200,000. 50,000 from each of us. No one here is uncomfortable with that figure? Good. Well, now... Got a question for you. Not that I expect a straight answer. This proposition, just how dodgy is it? Well, it's rather difficult to say. See, I rest my case. Another question, which I doubt you'll answer any more than the first. Who are they? Well, like all of us at this table, these men prefer anonymity. And to your point, um... Bryn. Oh, dear. The first to break a rule. But to your point, Bryn, I can say they are foreign nationals, who desire to become a part of the English investor class. Russians. Got it in one. Cossacks. I fucking hate Cossacks. Well, if you can't join us, Bryn, I suggest that you remove yourself from any further discussion. I didn't say that, did I? Mmm? Good. Because the money you put in, you'll get back four times over at the payout. Ah, thank you, dear. Excuse me. You called. Thank you. Thanks, love. Well, I may have missed a step, but I am fairly certain that Adolf Hitler was not machine-gunned to death in a French cinema. Well, it would have been rather good if he had been. Yeah, but young people, they go and see a film like that and they think that that's what actually happened. Oh, no, no. I taught for 40 years and this generation are far less likely to believe everything they're told than we were. Oh, God! Roy, what is it? No, no. It's my knee. It gives way sometimes and then... No, it will be fine in a minute. Here. Here. I've got you. I've got you. - Thanks. - All right. All right now? Yeah. A titch down on the right. That's it. Thank you. Now, the purpose of this joint investment is the purchase of this property in the Caribbean. Once the purchase goes through, the property will be resold by prior arrangement at twice the price. When do we get profit? In one week's time. All transactions are done electronically via these keypads. I will now transfer... ...our £200,000... ...into the joint investment account. And all you do now is transfer your funds in the amount of £800,000 and, oh, we're tickety-boo. You put in 200,000. We put in 800,000. Right. Your investment is the greater, but then so is your profit. Well, if there are no more questions... Yeah, I've got a question. See, all this money you're gonna make, what's Putin's cut? What the fuck was that? I'll see you out. They were not amused by you. How'd you know? You don't speak Russian. Don't have to. Well, how do we get them back? We'll have to regain their trust, won't we, Bryn? Yeah. Bryn. Heigh-ho! Oh. Has your knee gone again? Well, it's been like this for a few days now. Why didn't you take a cab? Oh, I made it here, didn't I? Yes, and you've probably made it worse. Anyway, it's bloody closed. Oh, and I didn't call to bloody check. I have made a hash of things, haven't I? Watch this. Well, this is unexpected. I bought it today. Did he give you good terms? You know, these dealers, they like to take advantage of our sorts. Oh, no, I paid cash. You stay here, I'm gonna pick you up. You paid cash? What I love most is how quiet it is. Mmm. Took some getting used to, but now I really enjoy it. Wait. Wait, Roy. I'll get you. Just a sec. - Okay. - You're all right? Oh, dear. Yes. Oh, dear, oh, dear. There. - Don't you... - No steps. Oh, well done. - Okay. - You're okay? Yes, yes. Very up-to-the-minute, isn't it? Thought I'd start afresh. Yeah. Jesus. - Unbelievable. - Oh, Betty. This has been a feast. Just leftovers. Yes. No, but it's what you did with them. Betty, are you back? We're here! Ah. Stephen. The grandson. Roy Courtnay. I thought you were out tonight. No, no. We're in. Roy's knee went out on him. Oh, really? Should we call for an ambulance? Oh, no. It's nothing as dramatic as that. Does Stephen live here with you? No, no. He's doing his doctorate at Royal Holloway. He just sleeps over on occasion. - Ah. - Can I give you a lift? To? To wherever it is that you live. Stephen, we haven't finished dinner yet. Oh. I suppose I should be getting along, yeah. Then I insist that Stephen drive you home. I think I'll come along for the ride. Many, many thanks. Here we go. Good night. What floor do you live on? On the top floor. You can't go up and down all those stairs. What would you have me do? Sell up and move? No, for God's sake. Come and stay with me. - What? - I've got a spare room. What are you doing? I mean, just till you get back on your feet. Betty, you are as generous as you're beautiful. But no. Whoops. There we go. This is ridiculous! I'm afraid I haven't got around to this room yet. So, it's a bit bare. But you can use all the drawers and, of course, there's the wardrobe, that's empty. Yeah. So, I'll get you some towels. Make yourself comfy. Fat chance of that. That's very kind. Keep up. Plenty of time for rest afterwards. All there? Ready? Two more kilometers. No dilly-dallying. Well, I don't speak to him either, I just... Yes, she's so big, I can't believe it. Come on, ladies. Here we are. Inviting him to move in, what were you thinking? Oh, please, what's the harm? When's the wedding? Huh? Saturday week? No, it's too soon to be getting so close to him. I would have thought that was the whole point. Yes, of course it is the whole point, but I didn't think it would get this intimate. Are you talking about me? Albert Speer. He's my dissertation subject. - I was saying... - Ah. ...the closer one gets, the more one loses perspective. You've lost perspective on Albert Speer? Mm-hm. I'm trying to determine whether he was the innocent he claimed to be. Oh, I thought that had been sorted out when you were in nappies. I think these sorts of questions are rarely completely sorted out, are they? Was it history that you taught in school? School? No, Roy, Betty taught at Oxford. You hide your light under a bushel, don't you? There he goes, trailing his cliches behind him. I think he's quite charming. You did not just say that. Do I detect a touch of jealousy? Hello. Betty says wherever you need to go, I'm to take you. Where to? Departure lounge on the River Styx. An old friend's got pancreatic cancer. Said I'd drop by. Nice. Can I take your bag? Thank you, Stephen. - It is very kind. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - Mind your fingers. Would you like to come and see him? Uh, no. I wouldn't want to intrude. Shall we resume? Uh, I've got something to say. I'd like to thank everyone for making the effort to convene us again today after our first meeting. We got off on the wrong foot. Well, I know I did. Unintentionally. As a gesture of this, and to decrease your risk, we have increased our stake to 100,000 each. Doubling it to £400,000. Well said, Bryn. Well. Let's crack the vodka! All right. Bryn! The second time's a charm. Good day's work. I'm pleased. He's wearing a fucking wire! Police. Police! Fuck! Police! - Freeze! - You! Freeze! Get back! No, no, no! That way! Use the back stairs! Use the back stairs! Stairs! You're under arrest! Don't move! Stop! Freeze right where you are! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! English investor class. Vlad. Thank you. Well done. Well done. Tickety-boo! And? Was he glad to see you? Poor sod didn't even know I was there. Really? Another bottle? Your grandmother's throwing caution to the wind. Fine. No, thank you. Oh, don't be such a prig! This is your going-away dinner. Yes! Where is it that you're off to? Uh, some... Spandau Prison. Is it for a long stretch? That's funny. Spandau was where Albert Speer and the rest of the Nazi war criminals were imprisoned. Return to the scene of the crime? Stephen believes in the power of place. It's mostly rubble now. But the past becomes more tangible when one experiences the environments in which they occurred. I never was one for history. I mean, what is the point in looking back? What's done is done, and you won't undo it. You may begin to understand it, though. Ah. Seems like you've had quite a past, Roy? Oh, my! Enough to last several lifetimes. Were you in any branch of the services? The armed services? Yeah. The ones with guns, yeah. I did serve in the army, as it happens. The war. Is that how you got the scar? On your neck, there. I told your grandmother when we met, what I deplored most in this life was a lie. So instead of making up some story, I'm going to say that I prefer not to discuss the circumstances under which I was wounded. I withdraw the question. I did it shaving. Ah. Yes, yes. Very good. Very good. Bye! Good luck! Well, that was lovely, wasn't it? Did you enjoy that? That's twice now. Twice what? Twice that car's come sneaking around. Are you sure it's the same car? Yes. Silver Audi with a scratch on both sides. Well, I don't know who it is. Tickety-boo? Tickety-fucking-boo. Oh, it's good to be back in the city. I don't know how much more I can take of that place. It's like being smothered in beige. Any grumblings from our investment group? As far as they know, you and I are in custody. Their funds are frozen solid, and the police are on the lookout for them. Lose a 100 grand apiece. They've got no one to blame but themselves. Call it a lesson learned. Well, it is that. Should we take care of our problem? Vlad? Vinnie here says that you're displeased with your fee. I don't want a fee. I want a cut. A share in the profits? Well, same as you. Same as Vinnie. I value the verisimilitude that you bring to the party, but I... Don't fuck with me, Roy. The store is closed. Please move on. I know things about you. Who you really are. I make allowances for poor manners. I tell myself, cultural differences. Do you know what you'd get back in Shittingrad for what you said just now? Your head in a bag with your balls in your mouth. I, by contrast, prefer an appeal to reason. No! Since when do you do the shopping? I'm exploring the joys of domesticity. To new pastures. How much do you think she's worth? Half a million at least. The only challenge is the grandson. The little shit's off on a wank for a few days, so this is an ideal window. I'm back! Here in the kitchen! Ah, Betty. - I hope you don't mind... - Oh! ...but I've invited a friend over. Vincent Halloran. Betty McLeish. - Hello. - Hello. Vincent is my... What is it you call yourself? The investment advisor. It means glorified accountant. I'm just helping Roy get sorted. You know, it's my will. It's not a fortune, but I've saved all my life, and I am thrifty. As anyone who's ever been to a restaurant with Roy can attest. It all sounds very complicated. I'll leave you to it. It's very simple, really. The goal is just to minimize exposure. Taxes and such. Truth be told, I was hoping you'd let me leave something to you. What? Roy! What are you talking about? How long have we known each other? No! You've got your son to think about. Robert? Oh, no. He's not in my will. I don't approve of his lifestyle. He designs kitchens. Granted my little pot probably won't make a ripple in what you've got. People don't like to talk about money. It's a taboo subject, but it's so important. True. Like sex. Or going to the lavatory. Critically important, but not a subject for polite conversation. Yes, well, it isn't. Well, what I think Vincent means is that we have to look after what we worked to secure. That's right! One's interest, one's assets, family. Might I ask what the strategy has been vis-a-vis your estate? I don't think you could call it a strategy. Uh... I've got my savings, and then I've got the fund that Alasdair set up. And, of course, I own this house because I paid cash for it. So, if we include the savings, the fund, and the house, your total assets might come to... It's about 2,700,000. Something like that. Maybe 800, I think, the last time I looked. May I call you Betty? Well, over a 5-year period, I will project an annual return of 15 to 20% That is a doubling of your money in five years. Is there a risk? Well, there's a risk in crossing the road. Another benefit is that our investments assist in the growth of underdeveloped nations. So, your money would be helping those in need. That's nice to know, isn't it? Double my money in five years? A little more wouldn't go amiss. Now, something for you to think about, and you too, Roy, is a way to manage your overheads and streamline the investments. Oh, yes, what's that? Well, to limit the administrative costs and your tax liability, you could both open a joint portfolio. You mean combine my money with Roy's? I'm sure you had something similar with your late husband. Well, yes, but we were married. Yes. True. But a combining of the assets is the best way of confounding the Inland Revenue. Well, you certainly have given one a lot to think about. Thank you, um, Vincent. Vincent. Do you ever get lonely in here? What? Oh, this room. So quiet. Roy, it's lovely of you to think of me, but if you want sex, I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass. Oh, no, no, no. No, I wasn't going to suggest that. Just a little cuddle. I do appreciate it, but I've always felt our relationship was more along the lines of a companionship. We've moved on from there, surely. It's not a swollen knee that's keeping me here now. We've developed an intimacy, closeness. We're close enough that I clean your toilet. And you do miss on occasion. I apologize. I shall attempt to make true my aim. But as to the two of us... No, Roy. I do. I know what you're saying. It's just that... Well, Alasdair and I... Yes, I understand. Thank you. I know I'm no treat, but I've grown very fond of you, Betty. "Fond"? That's such an English word. Hmm. I've never been comfortable with the word "love." Not even with my wife. Roy. You just opened up to me. Well, we should do something to mark the occasion, but you've already turned me down. Look, if you would like me to say "I love you," I'll certainly have a go at it. When the time comes. Roy! Roy! Betty! What is it? There was a man. Hang on. Okay. Somebody tried to break in last night. Do you know who? There's a cunt in a silver fucking Audi keeps coming around. It could've been him, but I can't work out why. Should we put it off? No, no. She'll be back from the hairdresser's at 1:00. So, Roy's had a doubling of his investment. It's what we like to call a "windfall." How often do these windfalls come? Oh, once or twice a year. Oh, my God! £20,000? That's like winning the lottery. Investing with Vincent is like winning the lottery and Royal Ascot. Given the size of your estate, there'd be a windfall every week. So, what would you... - Mmm? - Stephen? I thought you were in Spandau. Oh, did you? Well, they let me out early. Oh, Stephen. Why didn't you let me know you were back? You should have called. What have you got her doing? So, he moves in here with his gammy leg, and the first time I leave you alone with him, he's got you giving him all your money. - No! - No, no, no... That's not what's going on here! That's jumping a few fences. Listen, Roy, do you know what? This isn't your house. - Stephen! - He's an intruder. Can you see that? You're embarrassing me in front of Mr. Halloran and Roy who I... Look, I'm sorry... Don't touch me. Mr. Halloran, I am very sorry. Stephen, I know my appearance on the scene has altered your relationship with your grandmother, but I do have an advantage over you. My age. I'm of your grandmother's time. The world we grew up in, the world we knew. And not being a member of the family, there's an added compensation which you might call a romantic possibility. If Betty gains by something that you couldn't possibly give her, good for her. God knows it's good for me. Sorry. Listen, my dear, what if you gave the windfall to Stephen? £20,000, it'd be far too much. He wouldn't know how to spend it. Then half. 10,000 for Stephen, 10,000 for us. Us? That trip you mentioned. The one you were planning before Alasdair died. Oh, Roy. You are the kindest person. My own Delilah. Can't have you going on holiday with all these shaggy bits. So, where do you think we should go? Alasdair and I were planning on going to Paris, Venice, and then Berlin. Oh, Berlin. It's all so gray. No, no. It's the most exciting city in Europe at the moment. Oh, yes. Incredible architecture. And the restaurants, and the history. Suppose we went the warm and sunny route? Like Costa del Sol, or some Greek island. What would you think of that? Betty? Betty, are you all right? I'll call an ambulance. No. No, no, no. Call my doctor. His number's on the noticeboard. Likely you've had another stroke. Oh, good Lord! Oh, I've had them before. Very small, very tiny, little minor strokes. Yes. And the more you have, the more damage they do. Have you been taking the pills I prescribed? No. There must be some treatment. Yes. Bedrest. Surgery. Reducing the tensions and activities of my life till... Mrs. McLeish. I'm not gonna do it, Doctor. I'm not gonna live as if I'm already dead. And if you don't, you won't live out the year. One, two, three. Are you all right? When I saw you on the floor... I mean, just a blink and your life's changed forever. You win. Paris, Venice... Und Berlin. Berlin? Good. Here you are, sir. No. Um... Mmm. Ah. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And that umbrella looks as though it's seen better days. That's seen me through the war. Yes. On the losing side, by the looks of it. Perfect. - Thank you very much indeed. - Thank you. It looks very good. Yeah. Now, I'm going to show you a pair of walking shoes that I'm absolutely craving. They're right here. There they are. Aren't they beautiful? I've had my eye on them for ages. But they're very expensive. What do you think? Look, why don't you go in and treat yourself? And I'll meet you at Fortnum's in an hour. For tea. - Do you know, I think I will. - Come on. - In an hour. Fortnum's. - Yes. Fortnum's. Excuse me! Excuse me! This is Charing Cross. This is the Bakerloo Line train to Elephant and Castle. Mind the gap. Stand clear of the doors, please. That was a good one you pulled, Roy! The other bloke was all, "Oh, don't make a fuss. It's only money." Then it hit me. If the Russians were wired, why didn't the police nick us at the first meeting? We committed fraud. Pure and simple. The second meeting was so you could double the take. Greedy old Roy. What do you expect me to do? Give me back my 100,000 quid. I don't have it. Get it! Or I'll tell the old bitch you're shacked up with. I'm gonna break something other than a bloody flowerpot. So that was you? Clever Bryn. - Help, help! - Help! Help! Please, an ambulance! We need an ambulance! Thank you. God bless you. Out of the way, please. Out of the way! Step aside, please. Out of the way. Gentleman at Charing Cross. Responding. Watch out! Out of the way, please. To one side. Oh, there you are. New raincoat? Well, it seemed necessary somehow. Shall we? I think we should move up our flight. - What? - Yes. I've got a sudden urge to leave. Let's go tomorrow. Why not? Thank you. Alasdair was here at the end of the war. He was always talking about the Brandenburg Gate. What it stood for. How it was fought over. And you wish he were here to share it with you. Don't you? Yes. But if he were, I wouldn't be here with you. All right. Stephen! Hey. I made it. Hello. You did. What are you doing here? We thought we'd surprise you. Yeah. I wanted to apologize for being an absolute shit. You don't know Berlin, but I do. So, what's first on the list? Well, Brandenburg Gate. Yeah. All that power. Yeah. All that confidence. Mmm. Little did they know. True. You speak German? Sorry? I wasn't really listening. Will you say that again? When they burn books, in the end, they also burn people. Yeah. Not exactly what I was hoping to hear on holiday. I didn't expect there'd be quite so many balloons. Looks like Disney runs it. Still, preferable to being shot at. Well, I wouldn't mind shooting a few. I think someone's getting cranky. Why don't you go back to the hotel? Would you mind taking him? I think I'm gonna go exploring. Doctor said you weren't to push yourself too far. Well, the doctor can bugger off. Oh. Do you know how many people were shot trying to escape over the wall? No, Stephen. I don't. I suppose you're about to tell me. Hello? Went the day well? What happened? Oh, it's just, I took a tumble. I tripped on a paving stone. Oh! Let me clean those hands. No, no, no. I can handle it. It's fine. No. You can sit down. Oh, you're huffing and puffing. Your heart's going a mile a minute. Now, come on. It has to be done. Ooh. Hmm? oh. - Was it one of your spells? - No. One minute I was up, the next minute I was down. It's this place. There's so much history. Everything is built on a heroic scale that makes you feel powerless and... There we are. All done. Roy's made it all better. Hey, hey. Sorry. Have you got the address, Stephen? Uh, yes. But first, a stop along the way. The restaurant's booked at 8:00. Yeah, trust me, it will be worth it. What is this place? Humor me. The owner's allowed us use of this flat. It's changed a bit. Hmm? Since you were last here, Roy. Stephen, what are you doing? I accessed his service records. Roy Courtnay. Born Dorset. Only child. Father a vicar. Lieutenant British Army of the Rhine. Wounded. Berlin. At this address. Well, yes. Roy told us he was wounded in the war. Yes, but this was three years after the war. And it involved a murder. See, at that time, Berlin was cut into zones. American, French, Russian, British. Lieutenant Roy Courtnay was assigned to something called V Section, headquartered here. Oh, Stephen, I must correct you. V Section was not headquartered in Berlin, it was a division of intelligence, based in Hanover, reporting directly to London. We were in the business of hunting Nazis. V Section had got wind that there was a man hiding out in Berlin. Martin Geiger. Not a trivial catch. No. He'd been an administrator at Bergen-Belsen. So, I was driven into the Soviet Zone by my German translator, Hans Taub. It was my first time in Berlin. But Taub, Taub had come home. Must be strange coming back to all this. I hate this city. People who lived here deserved what they got. But surely your family... My father died before the war. The rest soon after. I have no family. Taub was a lost soul. The war had left him old before his time. Once we finish, find a nice bar, chat up a couple of girls. What do you think? Better to pay for one. The price these days is not so much. And to arrest Geiger, we needed the Soviets' approval. We had to wear civilian clothes. No dogtags. Nothing to identify us. Geiger was staying with a friend, Franz Konig. Here. You're right. In this flat. The plan was that we would come here while Geiger was at work, say that we were German police and wait for him. A routine lift. Except that the war hadn't really ended in Berlin. Make the smallest mistake and you could end up in enemy territory. I didn't speak German, so I left the talking to Taub. Taub did the heavy lifting. All I had to do was keep my bloody mouth shut. Uh... Ja. Danke. English. Geiger. Come in. Put the gun down. Just leave. Gun! Okay. All right. Hans Taub was killed. Geiger got away. Actually, no. Martin Geiger was caught two weeks later by a Soviet patrol. His confession was very clear about what had taken place. Who was dead. And who wasn't. It all happened so quickly. When I opened my eyes, I saw him lying there. Courtnay. Roy Courtnay. His face shot off. I don't know how long it took me to work it out. Nothing could bring Roy Courtnay back. His family would never set eyes on him again. But Taub, his... My family, they were all dead. No one was waiting. No one would mourn. Becoming an Englishman wouldn't be difficult. I'd been teaching the language since I was 14 years old. At headquarters, people had often remarked on the resemblance between Lieutenant Courtnay and me. This was my chance to get out. To leave behind the country that had given me a lifetime of misery. I could start over. Be on the winning side for once. I crossed into the British Zone, talked my way onto a transport plane and I was in England by next morning. I typed a letter to the reverend and Mrs. J. L. Courtnay on their son's Remington informing them that my experiences in Germany had changed me irrevocably. That I saw a different future for myself, and that as my decision was final, a clean break was the best solution. All expressed kindly, rationally. With love. When that was over, I changed my name to Roy Manning and I waited for them to die. Yes. And when they did, Roy Courtnay reemerged. May I ask, what it is you hope to accomplish with all this? Justice. A man named Hans Taub, presumed dead, has been roaming the earth for 60 years, not having paid the price for a single crime he committed! Hans Taub wasn't a war criminal. He was conscripted. He served in the infantry, both fronts! Oh, you think you've caught yourself a Nazi, don't you? Well, have you looked in the Dienststelle? The personnel files, the military trials? Yes. And did you see anything there that implicated Hans Taub? - No. - The Russian files? Anything there? Well, not that I can find. No. Nothing then. For the last half century, I have lived as honestly and as decently as any Englishman. Honestly? You may not be a war criminal, but there are plenty of other crimes... Stephen, enough! You assume it's necessary to save your grandmother from all sorts of imaginary dangers. Look, you don't know him! I make my own choices. And I don't need your permission. If you can't respect that, then I think it's just as well that we don't see each other for a while. Obviously, I'm intruding. Mmm. Do you know who you are? You're the only person on this planet who makes me feel that I'm not alone. Oh, to hell with Venice and Paris, let's go home. Oh. Glad to be home. Oh, yes. Roy. - Why don't you call Vincent? - What? Let's go forward with the joint account. - Are you sure? - Yes. So, we're going to do the usual? I transfer my funds, she transfers hers, and then I suck the money out of the account. You're gonna take the lot? It's nearly £3,000,000. After a lifetime of effort, where a good score is 100,000 split too many ways, yeah, you bloody bet I'm gonna take it all. It's what we like to call a windfall. Oh, it wouldn't hurt to leave her a bit though, would it? When I'm running down the hill, I don't want to have to depend on the fucking National Health Service. I plan on having enough money to just sit on a beach, sipping champagne. Is that why you think you do it? For the money? It's the game. It's the adrenaline rush. What if it is? You get just as big a jolt if you left her a little bit to live on. What am I now, a charity? No. But, this one, she's pretty ill, isn't she? Well, do you think I don't know that? And who do you think's been caring for her? I see to it that she gets the right pills at the right time. I make certain she's in bed at a decent hour. No refined sugar, no caffeine. No talk of politics or her bloody blood pressure goes through the roof! I don't need you to tell me that she's ill for... You don't wanna do this, Roy. Don't I? Don't tell me what I want, Vin. I'll do what I do. If your feet are getting cold... No. Mmm-mmm. I'm in. Good. I'll just close up here and then it's onto the next flat. And the next Roy. Are you having second thoughts? No. Not a bit. To the matter of the joint trust. Are you both agreed to the combining of your individual assets? I am. I am. Please, sign here. Here and here. Both copies. So, shall we effect the transfer? Yes. The bank here is Hayes & Paulsen in the Caribbean, and with these keypads, you can log into your joint account at any time to see how well your investments are doing. Betty, will you please transfer your funds into the joint account? Uh... Um... I wonder, I mean, is it wise to transfer all of it? To take it right down to zero? I mean, wouldn't it be a good idea maybe to leave a bit? That would be prudent, wouldn't it? True. It might be. But, um, it's also true that the less one puts in, the less one gets in return. Ah, well, that is a point. Mmm. It's just that... Well, I had a recent... Um... Vincent... Betty has had some health issues of late. Nothing terribly serious, but it does make one think twice before taking a risk even on such sound investments. Which is why I've been holding back a bit myself. 1-7-1... 7-7-6. I put in everything. Everything. You certainly have. Ooh! You've been hiding your light under a bushel as well. No, no. I said I was thrifty. And then some. I'm all in, too. Roy, will you now deposit your funds? Um... Yeah. Oh, yeah. So, now for security and so that only you two have access to the joint account, you need to create a passcode. Um, six letters. Uh, some... What about that? Well, flowers? No, that's seven letters, isn't it? It is. No, no. The kind of flowers. Oh, lilies! Oh. Nice. Well, if that's your choice, please type "lilies" into your pads. I. L. L. - Done! Ha! Congratulations! - Yes. I think we should celebrate with champagne. Well, I would, but I'm afraid I'm driving. Oh. Don't you want to get that? What? Oh! No. Right. Vincent, thank you. Thank you. Until next time. What are we drinking to? What we must always drink to, the future. The future. How should we spend the profits when they start to come in? I thought maybe we could book a cruise, or we could get one of those timeshares in Mallorca. Yes, we could. Anyway, we don't have to decide now. Oh, no, no, there's plenty of time for all that. The important thing is it's all packed away in one place, where it's safe and sound. Like us. Oh, hadn't you better check your mobile? - Hmm? - Mmm. That call. Was there a message? Was there? I don't know. Mmm. - It's my son. - Robert? Yeah. He's in London. Had some kitchen show. He's flying away to Canada tomorrow, wants to know would I like to see him tonight. - Oh, you must! - No. We're not close. Roy, he's your son. I'll drive you. I'd love to meet Robert. Oh, no, no. I'll take the train. I doubt there's much chance of it, but if we go to dinner and it gets late, well, then I might stay over. - Oh, yes, that's a good idea. - Yeah. Why don't you grab some water for the journey? You don't want to get dehydrated. Oh, thank you. - Cupboard on the left. - Right. Top shelf right at the back. Oh, dear, this one? Oh, yeah. I don't think I'll go, um... Why should I when I can stay right here with you? I do love you, you know. Stick to the plan, Roy. Go to London. See your son. Train now approaching Platform 4. - After you. - Oh, thank you. This is Vincent Halloran. Please leave your name and number after the tone. Get over to the fucking flat. I don't have the fucking keypad! Cunt's got one fucking thing to do. Stay near the fucking phone! Fucking cunt can't even get that right. Hayes & Paulsen. This is Shayla. How may I help you? Yes. My name's Roy Courtnay. I'm trying to transfer some funds from my account. And I've left my keypad at home. We can courier another keypad to you. I just need to ask you a few security questions. And how long would it take to get the new pad to me? A couple of days. Hmm. Is there any way I can do the transfer over the phone? I'm sorry. But I'm afraid you're gonna have to go home and get that pad. Yes, you're right. I am. Betty? Betty! What are you doing here, Roy? Oh, Robert's flight was delayed. Oh, dear. How did you find out? He called. Betty. Where is everything? What's that you're doing? Oh, I was looking at our joint account. I've entered the passcode, so I am as you say "in." Now, every time you lie, I press this button and £50,000 leaves our joint account and goes into another account. Different passcode, different bank. I don't know what you're talking about. You just lost £50,000. I haven't the slightest idea. - Another 50. - Betty, it's me. Roy. I mean Hans. Now, tell me again, how did Robert let you know his flight was delayed? Well, he called me. Well, I mean that he left a message for me. Oh, Betty. Oh, for God's sake. I don't know. I don't know. So, now you're calculating how much you can lose before it gets serious. Let me save you some money. You came back for this. Oh, well, I did notice that I didn't have it with me. Mmm, you thought you'd taken it to London. I thought I had. And it was so important you came all the way back. Well, no reason to spend the night in town, if you can come home. Does this look like home? Isn't it beginning to sink in just a little bit? Betty, what the hell is going on? Oh, my, you are slipping, aren't you, Roy? Robert didn't call or leave you a message because there is no Robert. You have no son. Come on, Roy, you must see it. It's been right in front of you the whole time. Flowers? Lilies. Lili? Hans. Back then, Friday was my favorite day of the week. Friday was when Hans Taub came to teach me English. I wanted to greet you myself, but you came early and I wasn't ready. So Mother had you wait. Your daughter is a very good pupil, Frau Schroder. She says you speak in English only. That is the point of learning it. I've often wondered what if I'd been ready earlier. If you'd never seen my sisters that day. Hmm. Hans. Hans! I am ready for my English lesson. It's pretty, isn't it? This is the lock of hair that you gave me. I suppose I worshipped you. But you never noticed. Do you like me, Hans? The look on your face. You never considered the question. I'm fond of you. Does "fond" mean "love"? Stand up. Here. "Stand absolutely still," you said. Close your eyes. "And close your eyes." And then you raped me. As consolation for your humiliation. As revenge. I was small. I was easier to manage than my sisters. I was less of a stranger. Less of a challenge. It was over very quickly. When you were finished, I remember thinking... "I must put on a clean dress." Lili? Hans! Lili? Two days later, my father was arrested. Someone had denounced him as a traitor. He was tried, found guilty, and hanged. The money, the factory, everything was confiscated. It was all too much for my mother, so she committed suicide. And then it was just the four of us. Well, we took in boarders. First they paid, but then they couldn't. And then towards the end of the war, my sisters were in the kitchen trying to make three eggs feed a dozen people. And a bomb struck. Killed them all. They'd let me sleep, so I was unharmed. Two weeks later, Hitler committed suicide. And then the Russians came. You know, it's very peculiar doing things you'd never in your life imagined, just so that you can live another day to do them all again, and more. And worse. Secrets between you, God, the devil and the dead. Lying. Becoming a very good liar. Betty... Lili... I never intended you any harm. When you denounced my father, what did you imagine would happen? Well, I suppose I should have known that your family would be in some kind of trouble. How could I calculate these things? I was a child. You were 15! You knew exactly what you were doing, didn't you? Well, I suppose... Well, I don't know. Do not do that one more time. Your sisters humiliated me. Your father wronged me. I wanted to teach you a lesson. And there it is. Oh, Betty. Why did you go to all this trouble? Once you'd found me, you could have just talked to me. Well, I doubt whether I would have accomplished very much if I'd said... "Hello, I'm Lili Schroder. "I'm the girl you raped in 1943." Talk to you, Roy? No. First I needed to study you. Fortunately, Stephen is an absolutely brilliant researcher. So it wasn't difficult for him to track your criminal career. You even appeared in the newspaper a few times, which helped me become precisely the kind of naive older woman - you like to victimize. - Estelle? Well, you've had your fun. But so what? Hmm? There's nothing to connect me with Taub. Do you remember our last day in Berlin when I went exploring? When you fell. I went back to my family's house. You'd barely recognize it. It's a children's charity. Hello, I'm Betty McLeish. Danke schon. There was no reason to believe I'd find what I was searching for. Ahh! My silver locket with your hair in it. You see, I already had a sample. Oh, Betty, you know I could have kept going tonight, but I came back. You came back for this. But I'd moved all of my money out as soon as your train left the station. Vincent helped me with the very, um, technical bits. - Vincent? - Yes! Stephen had a word with him before we left for Berlin. I think he put it to him that multiple charges of forgery, fraud, and extortion were not the legacy he might want to leave his children. Did he try to warn you? We were rather afraid that he might. Oh, and by the way, you know Stephen's not my grandson. I mean, I do have grandchildren, too many of them to count, but Stephen's not one of them. Oh, you did meet one actually. Michael. You know, the chap in the silver Audi. He's very protective of his gran. Stephen's his partner. Yes, they were very helpful in setting the stage for our little play. Every bland detail carefully chosen to lull you into a sense of complacency. There. Boring Betty in her boring house. What an easy mark she'll make. Your strokes? That doctor. I suppose all that was a lie, too? Yes, of course. He's a friend of mine. We wanted to soften you up so you'd put all of your money into the account. And why, after all these decades? Why do all this? Because for 60 years, I've been locked in that room with you. And the only way to free myself was to face you. Do you want me to ask forgiveness? I will. Yeah. I beg you. Oh, Roy. I forgave you a long time ago. I'm beyond you now. Tonight when I saw that I didn't have that bloody keypad, you know, I was elated. What I said at the station, I meant every word. And that's why I came back. I'm leaving you this. You may well need it. Where are you going? Home. There are people outside just waiting for me to call. With this? - Help! - Come here. - Help! Help! - Shut up. Shut up. Help! Help! Help! - I said shut up! - Help! Help! Help! Help! My God! Well done, Betty. Are you going to give me my money, Roy? I don't have it. I think you'll find he's got exactly what you're owed. And if he says otherwise, he's lying. Are you gonna hand it over? Nein. A person lives a long, full life, with barely a scratch just to get beaten by hooligans and have himself a stroke. It makes you almost doubt the world. The generation that won the war. He can't talk or move much, but he can hear you. Hello, Roy. You can hear fine, can't you, Roy? You a relative? No. But I'll have to do. Here. Pretend it's champagne. It is so good to see you back in your natural surroundings. Yes, you prefer tea on the lawn to a beer hall. That's because you're English. You know, any mistakes that I made in Berlin... were because... I'm so fond of you. Hmm. "Fond." Mwah. - Here. Take this. - Yes. Off we go. She's always been that sort of person. Oh, I'll have one. Now she's going to force me to go outside. Look what I've got. Oh, yes, please. Lovely. You can have him back now. Aw, I was hoping you'd keep him. Shut up. Michael, give your mum one first. Okay, fine. There you go, Mum, for you. More champagne? Dad, you're all right? Drink? Be careful! It's deeper than it looks. It's all right, Gran.
