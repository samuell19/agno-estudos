(adventurous music) (dramatic music) - [Henry] The late 1800s was the golden era of sail on the Great Lakes. Fast-trimmed schooners numbering in the thousands graced the horizons. These vessels carried passengers and immigrants bound for the growing Midwest. Ships also carried lumber, grain, ore, and other commodities. The climate and geography of the Great Lakes posed many challenges, developing a breed of skilled mariners. Staunch wooden vessels were built specially suited for America's inland seas. (waves crashing) Sudden gales often swept the lakes with hurricane force. (waves crashing) Just before winter's icy lock and the closing of the shipping season, storms in late fall were the deadliest and most feared. This masted and sheathed in ice, these schooners often fell victim. Sailors in desperation would struggle into the relative safety of the rigging, helplessly often froze to death or perished when the rigging gave way and the masts plunged into the surf. Between the 1880s and the turn of the century, over 2000 ships were wrecked on the Great Lakes alone. It was in response to this dilemma, both on the Great Lakes and ocean coasts, that Congress created The United States Life-Saving Service in 1876. Superintendent Sumner Kimball supervised the service until 1915, when it was reorganized as the U.S. Coast Guard. Lifesaving stations dotted U.S. coastlines at strategic locations. Dedicated crews were employed to operate these stations from nearby communities. The buildings and equipment were maintained entirely by these crews. 24-hour lookouts and beach patrols, as well as continual practice drills kept the stations at constant preparedness. The activities of the life-saving crews were inherently dangerous. The humanitarian efforts of the Life-Saving Service, often highlighted in bold and daring rescues, gain them the title "Heroes of the Storm." At midnight on October 16, 1880, a sudden and violent gale raged upon the waters of Lake Michigan. 118 lives were lost. 90 vessels were wrecked or badly damaged. This story is based on an actual account of the final voyage of one of these stricken ships. The schooner J. Hazard Hartzell. (solemn music) (seagulls squawking) - Ready? (rope squeaking) Give a little slack in this reel. (papers rustling) - [Captain] Station number four. 11th district. Pointe aux Becs Scies. October 17, 1880. The wreck and rescue of the J. H. Hartzell. The schooner, belonging at Detroit, had left Lake Superior with a cargo of iron ore. She was bound for Frankfort, Michigan, captained by William A. Jones and a crew of six men and one woman. The vessel arrived near the Frankfort piers at 3:00am Saturday morning. Captain Jones concluded that they should wait until daylight before entering the harbor. She tacked back and forth in a southeast breeze. - Give me a call at first light. (footsteps clomping) (Lydia coughing) - [Man] Go below, get the captain! (footsteps clomping) - Captain, we need you top side. (dramatic music) - She's comin' around the southwest. We can't hold the helm. - All hands! (dramatic music) (waves crashing) - Captain, she won't hold the course. (waves crashing) - Clear ship! (waves crashing) (dramatic music) - Steady! (waves crashing) (dramatic music) Water on the outer bar, dead ahead! (waves crashing) (dramatic music) - Not gonna make it around in time! (chain rattling) - [Captain] With the anchor chain gone, the Hartzell's bow swung toward shore and she sank upon the sandbar. Each violent wave battered the helpless schooner. (waves crashing) (dramatic music) Her small boat was quickly torn away. The captain ordered the crew up into the rigging. The cook, Lydia Dale, was seriously ill and very weak, and it took the united efforts of four men to get her locked into the cross trees of the foremast. (waves crashing) (dramatic music) By 8:30am, news of the disaster was brought to the station. (cart rattling) (dog barking) (waves crashing) (footsteps clomping) (knuckles rapping) - There's a schooner. It's run aground just south of Frankfort. - Ship ashore! Forward. (cart rattling) It's too rough to pass the beach. We'll take the inland route. - You wanna borrow the horse? - [Captain] We were compelled to take an old trail which had been pioneered by the Pointe aux Becs Scies lighthouse construction party several years before. For a distance of over two miles we journeyed over this trail, half choked with a dense undergrowth, and cumbered here and there with fallen trees, making progress despairingly slow. (ax thumping) (military drum music) - [Man] Heave. - [Man] Clear! - [Man] Clear. (branches rustling) (military drum music) - We're all clear! Let's make up some time. (waves crashing) (dramatic music) - [Man] Lend a hand here! (waves crashing) (dramatic music) - [Captain] Help was to save the stranded mariners, and while awaiting the arrival of the Life-Saving Service, the townspeople beginning to gather on the beach made an effort to console the sailors by gathering driftwood so as to form a giant telegram in huge rude letters. The words "lifeboat coming." (waves crashing) (dramatic music) - For god's sakes I hope they make it soon. (waves crashing) (dramatic music) - [Captain] The sailors wrapped the woman in tattered sailcloth to protect her from the bitter wind and snow. As she drifted in and out of consciousness, she was lashed to the base of the topmast to prevent her from falling into the sea. (waves crashing) (dramatic music) The difficulties of the country road are quite indescribable. The load which the horse and men had to drag weighed not less than 1000 pounds, and the hauling of this burden was not lightened by the incessant pelting of the hail and rain which lashed and stung our faces. The roaring beach fire built by the townspeople provided encouragement but little else for the stranded sailors awaiting our arrival. (waves crashing) (dramatic music) - I'm just ridin' up to see if you needed any help. - If I can borrow your mount I can get to the scene early and size up the situation. - You can have her, Captain. - Leg up. (horse whinnying) Continue on. (dramatic music) (heavy rain pattering) (dramatic music) - [Captain] Looming from the terrific confusion of the water, I viewed the nearly sunken wreck with its two masts still standing. The hull was smothered in the breakers. - This horse has caught up lame. He's not gonna pull any farther. - [Man] Let's unhook the cart. - Whoa, whoa. (horse whinnying) - [Captain] Ready? - Captain, we cleared a trail to the top! - [Captain] Let's get that cart up there now! (grass rustling) - I need some help up here. - [Captain] Knowing the summit would soon be gained, the hillside resounded with the blows of the implements and the heavy thuds of fallen timber lifted and flung aside. Townspeople, in anticipation of our arrival, were frantic with activity, uprooting and rending away masses of brush and undergrowth. In an incredibly short space of time the way through the wood was cleared and the mortar cart loaded with apparatus was dragged forward to the brow of the hill. (men grunting) - [Man] Heave! - [Man] Heave! Heave! Heave! - [Man] Keep it movin'! - [Man] Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! (men grunting) - There's one more crest! - [Captain] Despite having traversed over six miles of rugged terrain, our crew remained undaunted as we prepared to make our way to the summit. (waves crashing) (dramatic music) - The main mast is goin' down! (wood cracking) - Oh! - [William] Lydia. (waves crashing) (dramatic music) (sail flapping) (wind howling) - We'll go down this ravine. Unreel the whip line and take a turn around that tree. The ill-fated vessel and crew had been sunk upon the sandbar for over six hours. How much longer the crew could endure the violence of the storm was unknown. Yet we could not hasten further the arrival of the men and lifesaving apparatus. The descent continued steadily without accident to a point where it was found that the line employed to lower the cart was too short. - We're at the end of our whip line. - [Captain] Everybody take a place on the line. - Come on, let's go. Get to the ropes. (dramatic music) (wind howling) (fire crackling) (townspeople shouting excitedly) - [Man] Hold! Hold! - Set the Lyle Gun up there. (dramatic music) (waves crashing) (box top rattling) (waves crashing) Right, right just a bit. All clear, all clear. (gun blasting) (men shouting) The first shot fell upon her weather rigging where it was caught by the captain. - The slack's tangled in our wreckage. - [Captain] Unfortunately the slack of the line was immediately swept by the wind and current under the headgear of the wreck where it fouled and could not be cleared by the people on board. (wind howling) (waves crashing) The first effort to establish line communication with the wreck, therefore, proved a failure, and the shot line was hauled in and faked for another try. (military drum music) (waves crashing) The wet line and bitter wind numbed our hands, making reloading of the faking boxes a slow and frustrating task. (military drum music) (waves crashing) - [Man] Run with it. (military drum music) (waves crashing) - [Captain] This time with the view of overcoming the added weight of the line, which was wet clogged with sand, I used a heavier charge and also trained the gun higher against the rigging. (gun blasting) - [Man] Here she comes! - I got it! It's comin' clear, keep it taut! - [Captain] By noon, the shipwrecked sailors were in possession of the line from shore. The anxious question now was whether this line would stand the strain of hauling out the double rope, which was at once bent onto it. (military drum music) (waves crashing) An allowance had to be made for the slack in the line caused by the distance and tremendous current. It was manned with the aim of keeping the line as much as possible out of the sea. At times the force of the current would carry both parts of the double rope far too lured, and the sailors could only haul in a foot at a time. The strain on the slender shot line increased as it took out more and more of the double rope. - [Man] Keep pulling John, we're gonna make it. (military drum music) (waves crashing) - [Captain] Everyone felt the dread that the strands of the shot line would part, but the tough linen held. And after more than two hours of exertion, the sailors had the satisfaction of seeing the double rope arrive. (waves crashing) (dramatic music) - [William] Can you reach it, John? - [John] I think so, Captain. (dramatic music) (waves crashing) - [Captain] With the hauser successfully secured, the breeches buoy was at once sent out to the wreck. (dramatic music) (waves crashing) (pulley creaking) - Get Lydia in it! - [Lydia] No! - Lydia. Come on. - John, you go. Your spot. - [John] I'm okay. (dramatic music) (waves crashing) Oh! Oh. Oh. - Is that a woman we see in the trees? - Yes. - Why wasn't she the first to shore? - Doesn't want to get in the buoy. - [Captain] In response to my interrogation, the sailor proved to be John Cassidy, the vessel's first mate. He related to me that the woman upon the mast was the ship's cook, Lydia Dale, who had been ill with fever and now exposed to the bitter cold, was becoming delirious. - [Man] Are you all right? - The dune is giving way. It'll be impossible to keep the double line taut much longer. - You think we should use the life car, especially for the woman? - It would sure take the strain off the mast. - Let's use the life car. (dramatic music) (waves crashing) The life car, as soon as it entered the surf, was dashed about like a cockle shell. With darkness approaching, a sense of urgency prevailed, as the strenuous task of hauling began. - [Men] Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! - [Captain] Every face blazed with excitement. - [Man] Heave! - [Man] Pull! (dramatic music) (waves crashing) (men grunting) (dramatic music) (waves crashing) - Phil and Ed, you go! We'll get Lydia next time out. - [Man] Oh! (dramatic music) (waves crashing) - Lower. (dramatic music) (waves crashing) Okay, Cap. She's secure! (dramatic music) (waves crashing) - [Captain] As approaching night was fast darkening the storm, the lives of those still clinging to the swaying mast of spar and cordage were now in even greater jeopardy. The common assumption that the woman was at last coming in the life car provided inspiration to the rescuers who have endured many hours of tremendous hardship. The anticipation of being able to save those remaining on the mast gave a furious alertness to the coordinates of obscure figures on the ghostly beach, as the rope of the life car slid swiftly through the surf. (dramatic music) (waves crashing) (men grunting) (dramatic music) (waves crashing) - [Man] Bring a blanket. - [Captain] Everyone was confident that the woman would be brought this time and were stupefied when only the two men appeared. Why wasn't the woman brought with you? - [Man] She said she don't wanna get into that thing. It looks too much like a coffin. - [Man] She'll be on the next trip, Cap. - Get 'em to the fire. On the next trip, however, the life car brought only the captain and the second mate. My anxieties became intense unless some shocking accident should mare the closing act of rescue. On the third and final journey of the life car, I could barely see that it had reached the wreck, being able to discern only shadowy objects moving about the masthead. I vainly endeavored to determine whether the two sailors were engaged in lowering the woman from the cross trees. To give them every opportunity to save her, I kept the car a long time out. Fearful all the time that the crowd, impatient, might suddenly become uncontrollable and madly haul away on the line, possibly at the very moment when the sailors were descending, leaving them with the unconscious woman dangling in midair. The murmur of angry disappointment ran through the crowd. The horrible suspicion that the helpless woman was to be left lashed to the mast by a heartless crew took possession of every mind. (dramatic music) (waves crashing) (sail flapping) (dramatic music) (bright flute music) (rope and pulleys rustling) - Looks like there'll be one more for you up there, Ed. - Would you men care for a drink? - Yes, thank you, my dear. - Thank you. - Captain. - [William] Thank you, Lydia. - Where's Charles? - Charles? He's up on the fore deck. - Oh, thanks. (bright flute music) Charles? Charles? Charles? Charles? - [Man] Charles. They sent it back. - [Charles] Ah. All right. - [Man] Can you get down? - [Charles] Yeah. Yeah, let's go. - [Captain] With the command to haul away, the life car eventually emerged from the gloom over the riot of the breakers. (men shouting) (dramatic music) (waves crashing) - It's tied from the inside. - [Man] Bring a blanket! Bring a blanket. - [Man] Get a blanket on. - [Woman] Where's the woman? - It's empty. They didn't bring the woman! - [Man] Where's the woman? - [Man] Where's the woman? - [Man] She's not here. - Dag burn it, I would never lay hand on the line if I'd known you were gonna leave the woman out there. What's the matter with you sailors? - Hold on! Hold on! Why didn't you bring that woman in with you? - The woman's dead. - Be careful now. If you're not certain that she was dead, then say so. - The woman's dead. She's as stiff as a board. - What kind of sailor are you? Your men leave before the woman. Send the women in first. - [Man] Then everybody. - Is that woman dead? - She's been dead for some time. (people murmuring) We can't let any of you out to that wreck. That mast could topple at any time. (people grumbling) We'll have to come back at daybreak. - Steve, that'll be too late. - [Captain] The horrible sense of irremediable tragedy had its influence upon the generous men who had toiled so long at the wreck. In a few minutes, the whip was unwreathed and the sullen crowd bitterly disappointed at the loss of the woman, though they had saved seven men, dispersed and straggled away to town. The remaining life saving crew scattered around to different houses with instructions to reassemble at dawn. Before long, nothing that was human remained upon the scene except the body of the woman lashed to the cross trees of the mast out in the sightless darkness. (dramatic music) (waves crashing) In the night the mast fell. The body of the woman could not be found. It's gone, broken up. Although the circumstances under which this human life was lost is both ghastly and mournful, it is necessarily reduced to a secondary place by the noble exploits of the lifesavers. It should be remarked that this rescue was largely accomplished by the aid of the people from the town, for never was public recognition due to service in a humane cause more justly deserved than in this instance. Station Captain John Matthews. (solemn music) - [Henry] 17 days later, Lydia Dale's body drifted ashore. The coroner's inquest concluded that she had come to death by drowning, implying that when abandoned she was indeed alive. It is reasonable to assume, given the testimony of many, that the woman did pass into unconsciousness. This, combined with the effects of the storm, would have made it nearly impossible to lower her into the dangling life car. An instinct of self preservation displayed by the sailors may be in part understood. In a broader sense, Lydia Dale and 117 other souls lost in the gale join countless others who have perished in man's age old struggle with the sea. For over a century now in the port city of Frankfort, the story of the desertion of Lydia Dale has passed from generation to generation. The question will remain, however, as to why the woman was left lashed upon the ragged mast of the sailing vessel J. Hazard Hartzell. (military drum music)
