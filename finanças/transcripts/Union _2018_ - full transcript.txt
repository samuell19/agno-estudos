That's the Dog Star. During the great war when white brothers fought and killed their own people, but the Dog star danced with another. Your grandmother and grandfather, I will tell you their story, and how you came to be. Harrison, it's way past his bedtime. Let him just stay up for just this one story. It was a hot summer day. There was a fierce battle between the blue coats and the gray coats. The blue coats far out numbered the gray coats. But the blue coats fell like rain. They fell like wheat to the blade as they marched to their deaths. Dear God, they just keep coming. Your grandfather, part Tsalagi, a warrior, a gray ghost. He rode with a man named Mosby, war chief of the gray coats. As your grandfather lay dying on the battlefield, he made a promise to the great spirit that he would never fight again, but to find his true love, your grandmother, and speak to her in the spirit world. And so he did. I have gone to the mountain. I have seen the Indians there. I am a new warrior, and my sacrifice is my old way of life. My courage does not falter for I wear a coat of many colors. A patchwork of gratitude for the joy that you have given me, Virginia. You're all that I have left in the world, and I will walk across the continent and scale the Blue Ridge mountains just to see your kind face, to feel your tender touch and to hold you close once again, and before I touch the hem of heaven, I will walk through the fields of fireflies with you, knowing that every love is repeated and that every heart is complete. My last breath shall whisper your name. All my love, Henry. Oh, God, not yet. 13,000 casualties approximate. Rebels lost 6,000. Sir, a few Confederate cavalry men were taken prisoner. Caught them at Church of Bethesda down on the crossroads. Mosby's Raiders? Yes, sir. When Mosby's men are caught, hang them, without trial. Yes, sir. My pursuit of Lee has come with a great loss. We haven't lost yet... Loss of life. I will regret these past days for a long time to come. We will beat them with sheer numbers. It's a high cost for personal peace and sanity. Preservation of the union, sir. We must. ♪ On through the dark I search for thee ♪ ♪ Oh thou who'd will and fear ♪ ♪ I haste my best to find you there ♪ ♪ So cold my love so dear ♪ ♪ 'Tis her for whom my tears shall fall ♪ ♪ My prayer to her I send ♪ ♪ My highest joy caste in her form ♪ ♪ And where my trials shall end ♪ You pinin' over that boy?

You know, it's likely... I said I don't wanna talk about it. Lloyd and I are takin' corn into market tomorrow. You be all right by yourself? Mmm. I'm also takin' bandages and provisions and such for the prisoners, some ladies for church. Washington? Wanna come?

By your command, two are scheduled to hang later today, but the third probably won't last. Chest wound. The name in his coat, Henry Kieler. That man was executed two years ago. Imposters are all around. He probably pulled it off the condemned man. Show mercy, as God has shown mercy unto you, son. Let him go. Do you not have a conscience? Excuse us, please. Excuse us, please! I need a room, and a surgeon. Now! Nurse! Take this and burn it. I'm gonna need you to take a message to the front line to General Grant. General Grant, one of the three men captured during the cavalry raid at Cold Harbor was a woman. As a woman, she is a civilian and not an enemy combatant. Therefore, I request permission to keep her under house arrest removing her from your original orders to hang without trial. Your humble servant, Captain Lucius Walker. Crop didn't bring much. Market's down. How. We're gonna have to find a husband to take Virginia. We're gonna have to sell your granddaddy's farm, and that piano. Summer's comin'. You know what my favorite thing is in the summertime? Lightning bugs. Thousands of lightning bugs. When they all come out, right at twilight, blinkin' their little green-ish lights and winkin' at anybody who's watchin', fields light up with magic. You know why they blink their lights, don't you? They're looking for their mates. Each one has a light and when he beams the light just right the mate arrives, and they produce their babies just once, then their purpose is served and they can move on. Move on? They don't need to stay in this life. They let it go. Peacefully. Oh, all the babies come back the next summertime, and they blink their little lights and everything is repeated and everything is complete. I wish I could play. Soldier stole a hen last night. Wish I could do a lot of things, but, farm needs tendin'. I should pull this place down and sell it for kindlin'. Grandfather left it to me. It's mine. It's only your'n if you can work it. Anyways, you can't own land, legally. Land's worth more than the crop, anyhow. I need a hen. I can pay. It'd be a miracle. She kin? Fiancee. Said them Indians up there were bloodthirsty and anybody who went through that pass never returned. Lucius? Lucius? I'll take care of you now. Don't worry. My sister has gone missing. Have you seen her? No. It's all right. Where is she? Grace? I... I don't know. I don't know. Shh. My clothes. Where are my clothes? We burned them. Lice. Those were my clothes. That was my brother's coat. Those are my things. I'll buy you a beautiful dress. Lots of dresses in the new style. So, when you're recovered you'll have a whole new wardrobe of pretty things. Those were my clothes. They were my clothes. You were sentenced to hang today. Do you not feel anything for me? You're under house arrest for the time being. When you've recovered, you'll be in my custody, my personal charge. It is my privilege and duty to... tend to you. The others? William Overby and Thomas Carter were hanged today at three o'clock. I'm lookin' for Henry Kieler. Hey Henry. Got a visitor. See your wife found ya. Well, that's a real pretty friend. What are you doing? I thought I'd never find you. The Federals took Aunt Ruth's house in Baltimore. Baby got sick. Couldn't go with her to Atlanta. Can you cook, gal? Best cornbread you ever tasted, and black-eyed peas. Who's this handsome fella? This is Harrison. Who are you? Suzanna. You from around here? Where? Skinner's Gap. You know where Shepherdstown is? I need to go to Shepherdstown. You ain't fit to go nowhere. Well, not just yet. You're a prisoner, that's what they say. Can you write? Hey. Whoa, whoa. My sister-in-law, here, is a real good cook. And she's a hard worker, too. And she plays the piano. Hmm. Get a real good price for that piano. Can you work a plow, girl? Yes, sir. She's fetchin', I'll say that. Any children? She had a son, but he was killed. Yankees burned her house. Hmm. But she can bear, though. 20 somethin' and sturdy. Good hips. Lloyd. Might do you good to have some babies, gal. Keep your thoughts occupied. Tend the crop. And a baby'll keep your thoughts from driftin' back to the past. And that boy. I'll come 'round in a few days, sort out my business and such. Find a buyer for that piano. Much obliged for the coffee, Missy. And I'll send some folks to clear cut them woods back there, too. Wait, wait! Dear Virginia. I hope this letter finds you well. I think about you every day since we last parted. I have been taken prisoner by the Union forces and have been remanded to a cell in Washington. The hot days drift by slowly, and the only thing that calms my spirit is my determination to find you. I will find you. All my love, Henry. Come on, now. I am not marrying that old man. Then who you gonna marry? No one. Look, if you wanna survive, you're gonna do as I say. It's for the best. For you. Now, you listen. You listen now. For us. For all of us. We have all lost children in this war. And now, now we got a baby on the way, and you're bein' selfish. Kin has gotta help kin. Do you wanna starve, hmm? Do you want us all to starve? You cannot take care of this property on your own. We all gotta do our part. You fix it up pretty. The widow? What's this? A promise. From your beau? Looks kinda Indian. It's Shawnee. Is your beau Shawnee? Please don't tell anyone. It's a secret. I won't. I promise. Looks like a fisherman's knot. They say if you tie it a certain way, brings your soul mate to ya. You love him? They found these in your clothes before they burned them. You send my letter? I have to make my way back to her. Find me some boys clothes. Please. (spooky sounds Hostiles hide up here in these hollows. Thank you for my hens. And for this. What does it mean? Gratitude. What do these knots mean? They're just signs to those who know. Who, Shawnee? Cherokee? Anyone who walks this way. It's very dangerous if you don't know the path. Animals, outlaws, deserters, soldiers. Why are you helping me? Your music. You were calling for someone. Fix that coop. Turn her loose and see if she leads us back to Mosby. I can't do that. She could get killed. You know she'll go right back to him. Mosby has cut off almost every Union supply line here. Your country, or your future wife. Which can you live without? Let me think about it. - Colonel if I may. - Go. We have a situation. We have a woman in the ranks. Anyone's kin? String her up. Sir? We won't tolerate this. Yes, sir. I'll get you. Thief! You sum bitch! So, tell me about your plans after the war. Well, sir, I'll... I intend to take what gold I have down south. You look like you seen a haint. What is it? That boy. What boy? The one I seen at the hospital prison. The one Virginia's been pinin' over. They're the same. Well, there's no date. There's no tellin' when this was written. Lloyd! She's marrying Cochran. That boy's dead. Hanged over a month ago. You understand? I done it. You have to leave tonight. Go up to Brushy Mount. Show this to the people up there and they will take you to the hiding place. Don't go back to fightin'. My brother's horse is tied up just beyond the fence. Thank you much for supper. I'll be just a moment. Captain, sir. She's indecent at the moment. Best wait until morning. Everything is repeated. Everything is complete. I see you got my message. What happened? Got tangled up in a steel trap. Stuck there pert near the entire day and a night. May have to take it. Not sure he's gonna pull through this. Gangrene. Excuse us, if you please. This is Mr. Cox. He's an actor. He's going to help us. This is spirit gum. In the field, you can use pine resin, works just as well. Tap a jack pine, they're plentiful. And this is crepe hair. However, in the field, you can use the clippings from your own hair or the mane of horse, works just as well. You've concealed yourself well. Just like your brother. No! Shh, shh. Shh, be quiet now. It's gonna be all right. Promise. Have you lost your goddamn mind? What do you want? 'Preciate it. Cochran took a spill. Don't mean you ain't gettin' hitched, though. I ain't livin' with him. So, live in the woods, then. We've been ordered to hunt Kieler. Male or female, dead or alive. Two's to the left. March! 'Scuse me. I need to get to the Cacapon, Brushy Mount. You know them Indians hidin' for a reason, don't you? You some kind of deserter? No. Please. I'll take you to the pass, but I ain't goin' no further. Much obliged. Sir. Anything? Not a trace. She didn't go back to Mosby. He's ridin' the Rappahannock and led two raids already. My sister? According to the Confederate prisoners, Georgianna Hays was last seen with Kieler three months ago at Spottsylvania. Her husband was killed at Fredericksburg. Dammit! When the spirit of a man and the spirit of a woman are in the same body, it is a blessing. You're honored. You're respected. You're a teacher. This is no enemy. Virginia. What is this place? Looks like a spider web. I can take it all down. Not interested. Sorry, Lloyd. Looks like this place has some hoo doo on this property. I need a place close to the town anyway. Rode up with Doc Hobson. Cochran seems to be healin' up. You know this twine's an invitation for all kinds of critters. What did you come here for? People think you're crazy. Spinning a cocoon around the house. Plain crazy. I don't care. I seen this boy, in Washington. What, when? Was he in the jail? Virginia, he was mortally wounded. He had a huge hole in his chest. I didn't think he'd live through the day. Soldiers removed him from the general area so's his passin' wouldn't upset the others. But you didn't see him dead, though? No, but he was sentenced to hang with two others later that day. I'm so sorry. I lost my husband and my son, my love to this war. Why can't you just let me believe, Jess? Why? It's all right. It's all right, shh, I'm here. I'm here, I'm here, Hey be still. Shh, be still, be still now. It's all right, it's all right. Shh. You been up yonder between two worlds. High on the mountain and under the sea. You been on the red road. Your heart's weepin', that's why it won't heal. Shepherdstown, I have to go to Shepherdstown. Man-woman, powerful medicine. This is Greatly Beloved Woman, daughter of the last. Skirmish intervals, five paces. You will not find what you seek here. Lookin' for an outlaw. These mountains are filled with outlaws. Kieler. We know no one named Kieler. Confederate. This is sacred ground. There is no killing here. You may go now. No killin' ma'am. We will return him for trial. I know your trials. Like treaties, killin'. Go! Go! I have a regiment camped not but a few miles away. Look around you, blue coat. You see those bones? You see those scalps? Those bones and those scalps belong to soldiers who never made it to the top of this mountain. Now, go! Leave us! Fall back! Shepherdstown is on the road, just past the widow's farm. Much obliged. Thanks. What's your business? Ain't nothin' for you here. Git! Virginia! Do I know you? You're on my property. Looks like your house is gonna fly away. Henry? How'd you come by them whiskers? Well, I learned it on the road. You're home. Hear me out. If you go on livin' like Henry, I'll marry you, and then nobody can claim me. Marry me, Henry Kieler. Yeah. We don't want any trouble. Get off my land! We're lookin' for a man named Kieler. Nobody's been by here. Now, you wouldn't be hidin' him from us, - would you? - Hey. Hey! I said no one's been by here. You've already taken everything I got. Stand down! Shoulder arms! Henry Kieler escaped from the federal prison. Ain't nobody here. He assassinated a federal officer. Best not be feedin' strays, missus. He'll cut your throat. They'll come a reckonin'. Not today. Move out! Oh my God, what happened? I slipped out the damn window. It ripped open a wound. Come on, come on, they're gone, they're gone. Must have started at least a dozen letters to ya. Rest I stashed away. Someday you'll let me read 'em? Someday. Fix you something for the pain? Make you sleep? Yeah. Everything is repeated and everything is complete. Yeah. Who are you? Vet. Passin' through. You refill your canteen and you move on now, you hear? Come on! Yes? We're lookin' for a boy, goes by the name of Kieler. I'm sorry. I hear tell he died. May I ask when, ma'am. Month or so ago, up at the prison. No, ma'am. He escaped from the prison. Anyone around here named Kieler? Women folk? No. We're camped not more than a mile from here. We'll make sure he or she doesn't bother you. Much obliged. Move out! Hiding? It's best for now. Best for who? No good. You have powerful medicine. Use it. How? Beloved Woman says so, it is so. Soldiers won't find you. We make it so. We've chased the blue coats away. Come. Henry? Henry? Who's Henry? Oh, I see. You been takin' in strays. Where is he? Told him to move on. Can't afford handouts to every raggedy little man that comes along. What is this? Well, I'm keepin' Cochran's animals here. Makes sense since he'll be movin' in soon. I heard he's right poorly. Fierce poorly, in fact. It's postponed for now. Wednesday week I'll be by to fetch you to the church and you'll be dressed and ready to go. Get off my land. People find out about this and they'll think you's a soiled dove. I said get off my land! I ain't afraid of you. I ain't afraid of them Yankees and I ain't marryin' that old man. You will. Henry? Henry, I'm looking for Henry. Federal boys came by, lookin' for that boy, Henry. Is that so? He's not dead. He escaped. Come again? He escaped. I see. You feelin' okay today? Yeah. Beloved Woman asked me to lend you proper clothes, and a blessing. There's no fear in love, but perfect love casts out all fear. Fear has to do with punishment. Ain't no more punishin'. No more weepin'. Only singin'. Only smilin'. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Henry. Come, woman. I'm afraid my presence will bring... No, they won't find you. Hear me out. If I'm discovered, you can say I tricked ya. I'll tell 'em I tricked you. Mmm, no. Won't lie. I won't.

There were a few Confederates here yesterday. They came for services. Uh uh. Not now. And I heard 'em talkin' later. Said they were makin' their way to Fredericksburg. They had a boy with 'em and didn't call him by name, though. Thank you. I must say I'm glad that you boys have control of the situation. Form skirmish lines. You remember me from prison? No, can't say that I do. Hmm. Play one for the bride and groom boys. You're in here sleeping the day away while that field out there goes to shit! You makin' money on the side? He's my husband. Get out. Get out! Them Union soldiers are lookin' for you, Kieler. You want another dead husband? Lost your goddamn mind! Captain Walker. Sir. I must resign my commission. Have you lost your faith? No, sir. My family has gone missing. Disappointing. Dismissed. Lloyd Tull! Leave that boy be. What are you, Homeguard? If the Federals find him, we'll know. You threatenin' me? Right nice place, here. Shame to see it burn. You've been warned. William Harrison Hays. Come here now! Harrison. Harrison! Mama! Mama! Henry. Hey, it's all right. Shh, it's all right, shh. Your grandfather began to cultivate things that your grandmother could see in her spirit visions. Small things that would touch her heart. Henry. Henry? Hey, hi. Come on. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - No, no, no, shh. You know, we all lost something or someone, but thank God there are those of us worth finding. We thought we'd call on you since you've been feelin' poorly. Come in. Come in. This is my husband, Henry Kieler. Well, congratulations. Mr. Kieler. Mrs. Kieler. There's an old trunk upstairs. It's full of old things I was going to donate to church and cause. Might wanna look in it. There might be some things in it for Henry. I don't have anything. Let me go, please. Please. Burn it. No! No, my son is in there! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! - Shh. - I can still smell him. Shh, shh. It's all right. It's all right. Shh, shh. You got a good trade. Excuse me. Lookin' for the old Kieler place. Up yonder in that holler there. Yankees burned it down more than a year ago. On the road to Boonesborough. Nothin' there but foundation and family graves. Thank you. You kin? No. Friend. Much obliged. Hey put that down. Gimme your hand. Okay, careful now. Don't squish him. What do you see? You. Set him free. Go on. Come on, I gotta show you something. Okay, stand right here. All right, no peekin'. It's a surprise. Mmm. All right. Here we go. Step up. Yeah. Okay, right there. I brought the fireflies inside so they don't ever have to leave. Oh my God. I'm not sure I know... What. Shh, shh. Came by to take whatever crop you've got to market. I'll get a fair price. Watch Jess 'til I get back? Of course. Much obliged. Be nice to him. Lloyd. Can I get you something? Water? Yeah, thank you. You're gonna be fine, just fine. It's a part of nature, that's all. You sit a spell. Y'all planning on having children? I don't know. Can he? Or he got that soldier's disease? Y'all have consummated, haven't you? That's private, Jess. Lloyd seems agreeable today. Confederates stopped by, tell him who Henry was. What do you mean? One of Mosby's. Jess. Threatened to burn, threatened if he breathed a word. Wh... what's happening? Threatened to burn our farm. Jess. Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe. Henry! You don't say much, do you? Nothing to say. Henry! Henry! Henry, Henry, Help! No, too hot. Henry, help me! Get her situated on the bed. Get him outta here! Get him out! Jessie, no! Jess. It ain't proper. Well, what about him? I'll go... I'll go get Doc Hodson. We don't have time for that. But maybe we should fetch the doctor. Not now, Virginia. We're gonna have to do it ourselves! Oh my God! You're a girl. Shh, you hush. You hush up right now. Cord's around its neck. You can't let her die, Henry. Okay. Harrison! Mama! Okay, you're gonna have to push for her. Give me your hands, okay. Yup, right here. Okay, when I say, okay? When I say. Push. Push! Push! I'm pushing, I'm pushing. Was I trespassing? Where you goin'? Just trying to find my sister, is all. Nice pony. Dismount. Man said dismount. 'Member me, Captain Walker? At the prison. You gave the execution orders. They were General Grant's orders. My brother hung. Eye for an eye. We'll count to three. You can run just as fast as you can. I prefer to face my enemy. Promise me. Promise me you'll find my boy. Push! I'm pushing! Push, push, goddammit, push! Take his boots. And that hat. You have a baby girl. I do? Oh, she's beautiful. Here's your mama. Oh, come here baby. Come here sweetie. Ain't none of my business. - If you love... - I do. Oh God, not yet. Find my boy. Mama! He loves you, you know. Harrison. Henry this, Henry that. I want a pistol like Henry's. I want a horse like Henry's. I love ya, Henry Kieler. If anything happens, raise him up to be a good man. Georgianna. Virginia. After I... I lost my son, I thought I'd never play again. Then one day, I sat down at my piano, and I touched the wooden frame and cried. I closed my eyes and I didn't need to see the keys to know, and as I heard each note fly off the strings, like colors drifted past. And now, every time I see colors, I hear certain notes. It's like the moon sounds like a G, and the stars are like a B, and the sun is like a loud E sharp. And everywhere I look there's a symphony. See you. I see you, Grace. What happened? Henry. I could hear them coming. And they took her boy. They took Harrison. And then it got quiet. And she was a bird with a broken neck. Shot through the throat. Promise me. You find my boy. Promise me. Do it. No, Georgianna. And she looked at me with that look. And I said I wouldn't do it. And that sound of someone hanging on by a thread. That sound of someone dyin'. It plays over and over in my head when the night settles down. She begged me, Virginia, she begged me. And I promised her I'd find her boy. You promised me, too. Do what you have to do. I'm comin' back, I'll come back. I promise. If you're caught, they'll hang you. Your grandfather went up into the great north woods to find your father. But he really went to battle the darkness that kept pulling him back into the great war. My little Anabel Lee. My little Anabel. Why don't you take her outside Lloyd, let her see the evening sky? Get some fresh air. Okay. We'll go outside. We'll take a little walk, huh? See some stars. Have everything washed for you. Even packed a carpet bag. You shouldn't feel ashamed. Of what? How could you have known? Even I thought he was a boy, 'til he got up close. I heard him. Don't worry. You can have it annulled. I don't feel at all ashamed. I've known all along. If you say anything to anyone, and he doesn't return, I will take my own life. I'll have supper ready in a bit. My Virginia, it is the height of summer. At times I can hear the sounds of musket fire. It rattles my soul to its core. I cannot explain why it strangles me so. It simply awakens a sleeping nightmare. On the outside lookin' in courage would be to die in honor and duty fighting for a cause with high ideals. Courage from the inside lookin' out would be to walk away from war and risk being a coward among fellow veterans. But I say what greater honor and courage is there but to return to my beloved somewhat whole and unmarked. What greater courage, what greater love is there than to love you wholeheartedly, passionately and nakedly honest. I love you with all my being. Henry. Well, look who it is. How'd you find us? Indians. What are y'all doin'? Oh, we just finished a little ske-daddle with the rangers. Coffee? No, thanks. Reparations. I get the watch. Looks like you get the love letter, Jim. Can I have it? Trophy. We got the man that hung Overby and Carter. Lookin' for a small boy. Harrison Hays. Disappeared at Cold Harbor, taken by New York Cavalry. Jim runs a ring all the way up to Canada. He knows John Surratt. This is John Surratt. He goes by Watson. This fella here is lookin' for a child that was captured by New York Cavalry. What's the child's name? Harrison Hays. Disappeared at Cold Harbor. Where's his mama? Killed. You came all the way up north to Montreal to find a boy that's probably already died. Hmm? Or, maybe hidden not far from where you live. Where I live? Shepherdstown. Blue Ridge. Mmm hmm. Hmm. Must be an extraordinary boy. Yes, he is. Blindfold him. Three bits I call. I thank you wholeheartedly. Enlighten me, gentlemen. What would the Federal Army want with a five year old boy on a border state with no known allegiance? How long are you in the game for, sir? How is dear Edwin, by the way? The woman was mistaken for Anna Surratt, accidentally killed. Where's the kid? Why is it important? I wish to reunite him with his kin. Why is that important to you? Because. Because. His uncle is... Was a Union captain, under Grant. I'm just a facilitator, that is all. Gentlemen, are we playin' poker? Somebody deal or buy me a brandy. Deal me out. Privy calls. 'Nother round on me. Shelton of the 7th New York Cavalry brought the boy to the Orphan's Asylum. Ma'am. Found him. (footsteps We'll miss you, Harrison. Won't we? Goodbye, Harrison. There's chores to be done. Quietly.
