- We might have coupled in the bed-ridden monopoly of a moment, or broken flesh with one another at the profane communion table, where wine's spilled on promiscuous lips. We might have given birth to a butterfly, with the daily news printed in blood on its wings. Lonely undertaker takes home 24 corpses for company. Child sings in the womb. Woman receives letter from Joan of Arc. Dead couple wed at their funeral. - Well it's getting late, we better disappear. - How much do you wanna sell these for? - 200, no, make it 150, really wanna sell these. - Never a bride. - I was thinking about when I was a child, I had an imaginary friend who always wore a wedding dress. - Why would she do that? - She said she was gonna marry the world so she could speak to animals. - Do you still have your wedding dress? - Somewhere, maybe I should sell that one too? I was thinking I could take up knitting, maybe that's too old. There are so many ways to make money on the internet. Just have to find the right one. - Ah! - What are we having for dinner? - We're ordering out. - Oh, good. Not that I don't love your food dad, just I know you've been so busy you can use the rest. - Too busy to pick up your own daughter. - What was that? - Mom told me you've come up with a new name. What is it? - Oh, oh yeah, well I've been tossing around a few ideas, it's kinda like a recipe. You have to come up with just the right words. - So let me hear 'em. - Okay, okay, one I like recently is Beautiful and Real Food. Can you imagine that on the front of a restaurant? You go in and you know exactly what you're gonna get, you're gonna get real food. - Beautiful and Real Food? That's really good. - Yeah? - It's a little long, maybe you could call it for short, B-A-Oh... - No, it'd be B-A-R- - Dad, it spells barf. - Oh , oh that's okay. I mean nobody spells anyway. - Daryl I don't think you should use that name. - I can name it whatever I want. - Maybe you could switch it and call it Real and Beautiful Food? - Yeah, what's that spell Diana? - Rabf. - Great idea Danielle. - Mom, Dad, Danielle, this is Marlene. - Drew? This is the best news all day Hi! - Hi. - Andrew, is this your way of telling us college is off the table? - College, I thought you already knew that? Oh and no, the baby is not mine. - That's even better. Well what do you do Marlene? - Well I used to work at the library but I'm taking a break. - Library, there's fantastic cook books at our library. Does your job ever take you to that section? - Yeah, I've been to every section so. - Will Marlene be joining us for dinner? - I hope so. - Yeah. - If that's okay? - Well, we already ordered, we're having Chinese, so. - We can share, she doesn't eat much. - Isn't she eating for two? - Oh it's okay, I had a granola bar earlier so I'm. - Perfect, we can all share. - I'm going to pick up the food. - Danielle, can you make sure that Marlene has some rice and that Drew, he's gonna need more water, make sure that your mother is enjoying her food. - Yes chef. - Thanks. - Wait until you try the rice, I see you haven't tried it yet, it's got my special patented double D special sauce. Double D, it's Daryl Dent, it's packed full of flavor. - Oh it's certainly got flavor. - I would tell you what was in the ingredients but it's a secret. - Everything all right Mom? - So, Marlene, when are you due? - Not for a few months. - I think this is great, we're so proud of Drew. - And will the father be present? - Well Drew will be there. - Yes, I'm gonna be the father. - Well he learned from the best. - You know it's so important that the biological father be involved. - Yeah I know, he's just not interested. - He doesn't get a choice. - I think it's great that Drew is gonna be a father. Finally, take some responsibility and be a man. - Well, they must be paying a lot more than I think at that pet shop. - Oh well, I was actually hoping that maybe we could stay here for a little while. - Are you kidding? Of course. - So the play's going really well. - Oh, you're in the community play? - Oh, I wish, no, I just run the lighting. - You're better off, actors have no morals. - I'm sorry Andrew, what was that? - Well I was just thinking-- - I think it's a damn good idea. - I'm sorry, I don't wanna be an inconvenience, I don't have to-- - No no no. - You're not, that's it, it's settled. You guys are moving in. - It'll be nice to have a little one around. - Won't it? A baby. - Dad can you still give me a ride to rehearsal after dinner? - Oh, I can give you a ride, I have a car. - See, already part of the family. - But in the great world people don't hear of such things. There, nobody really believes such doctrines any longer. There, you find it a positive bliss and ecstasy merely to draw the breath of life. Mother, have you noticed that everything I have painted has turned upon the joy of life? - It's a world of shit Homer, good think you got me cleaning out your tank. You know, protecting ya? - Did you name him? - No, the boss names all the pets. - I wonder if it's after the poet. - I don't know but he is a big Simpsons fan. Let me introduce you to Marge. - Of all the creatures that breathe and move upon the Earth, nothing is bred that is weaker than man. - What's that? - Homer. You gonna play poker or something? - Pick a card. Queen of hearts. - How did you do that? - Magic. - You're gonna make a great father. - Yeah, I think it's the only thing I could be good at. Seen too many bad ones. You leaving? - Yeah, I told my mom I had rehearsal until eight so I should get back soon. - Well read the baby something sweet for me. This is Lisa. - The pleasure's all mine! - For every identity thief you catch with our software, you will be well compensated. Remember our identities are precious and with your help, we could protect you too. This is the Janus-- You'll realize how fulfilling it can be, in this world of delusion and illusion, thieves and deceivers, our responsibility is to determine what is real. - Marlene, where have you been? - I had play rehearsal, remember? - Oh, the "Sins of the Mother," you get my papers? Any news, reviews, who's who's? - No nothing about you Mom. - Did you look for Bridget Church, you gotta look for Bridget Church, I keep telling you. - Mom there's nothing. - Ah, I knew it, they're doing it again. You've got to read between the lines Marlene, they're good at hiding what they're really saying. But I'm glad you're here though, I need your help. - Mom, you got that dress like 20 years ago, there's no way you're fitting into it. - I gotta hurry, the interview is tonight. - Mom no one is coming. - Oh no, no, no, no, this isn't like last time, I spoke to them on the phone, they're coming, I just need them to see me Marlene, they know the star I could have been. Life works in strange ways, tragedy eventually leads to brilliance, that's why they're coming, that's why they wanna talk to me, everybody loves a comeback. - Ah yes, the great Monica Chiesa. - Oh you know I hate it when you call me that. - Mom that's your real name. - My name is Bridget Church, that's what everybody knows me as. A stage name allows you to take control of your persona, it's time you ought to think of one for yourself. - Mom I'm pregnant. - How about Veronica? Veronica Pond. - Okay I have to go to bed Mom. - Wait go? No, I need you here. - It's 9 o' clock Mom, no one's coming. - What do you think we're saving this money for? - I can try it tonight but I have to iron this shirt and go. - Jesus Christ, you only think about yourself. Do you know how hard I work? Do you know how much this means to me? How much this means to all of us and you're obsessing over ironing your fucking shirt? 'Cause that's what you do, you obsess. It's what you always do. - Do they come in sizes? - Why don't you start with these? I'll ring you up. 7.48. - Can I buy just one? - It's okay. - Thank you so much, you've saved my life. - Excuse me sir, could you repeat that, it didn't register. - Oh sorry, I'll take a cheddar cheeseburger with fries and a soda. - Coming right up sir. - Thank you. - Here you are Chef. - Daryl, how many times do I have to tell you, stop using up all the aprons, you're not a chef. - Sorry. - Dent's Diner. Daryl's Diner. Daryl Dent's Diner. - I don't understand, what do you mean I'm overdrawn? I'm sorry ma'am, there's no money in your account. - That's not possible, I checked it yesterday, I don't understand what happened. - Well it says here you completed a transaction this morning to Janus Identity Protection. - No, I paid them weeks ago. - You are familiar with that company? - Yes but I don't understand. Are you sure there's isn't some mistake? They're supposed to be wiring money into my account, not out of it. - Maybe you should try speaking with the company directly. - How do I get my money back? I'm not sure ma'am, let me put you in touch with someone in the claims department. - Trudy can you cover for me, I have a family emergency. - Yeah, don't worry about it. - Thank you so much Judy. - No problem. - And you too Trudy. - Hello, is anybody home? Mrs. Dent. - Please call me Diana. - Is Drew home? - He's at work. - Oh, okay, I just wanted to apologize to you, about the other night, I don't mean to be an imposition, I know this is complicated. - It's not a problem. - What's that? Do you need help installing it? I know a little bit about computers. - No I'm just trying to find the phone number. - Maybe we could look it up online? - Maybe you can help me. I need to get this phone number, I need to talk to someone at this company. - Sure, may I? - Oh, go ahead. I don't care about email, I just need to talk to them. - Well do you have an address? - Yes, there's an address, right here. - Okay if there's an address, we can look it up and see if there's a business listed and then probably find the phone number. - What is it? - It's just a house, it looks residential. - There's no phone number? - Nothing just the house. - I'll just have to go there. - What? - I don't have any money. - Can I help, is there something I can do? - You have a car, you can take me. - What, no, what, is something wrong? - I need to go there, right now. - I can't just leave. - Okay, tomorrow morning. - What is this company? What's going on, what did they do to you? - I just need you to take me, I can't take our car, it's too far away, Daryl can't know about this. No one can know about this. Please? I need to find these people, I don't have another option. - Geez, okay. - Oh Andrew, you can't tell Andrew anything, this is just between us. - Okay, I won't tell him anything. I hope everything's okay. - Hmm-mm. Okay. - Ah, Diana! Di? I can't take this shit anymore. - What? - That Goddamn burger place, that grease hole, those fucking chefs. When did life become all about them and not about us? Two months, I am not waiting more than two months before I open my restaurant and I don't care if we have to work every hour of every day to make the money for it. - I know how you feel Daryl. - Goddammit, you don't know how I feel. What is that? - Oh it's for work. I have to go into work tomorrow now, Judy's sick. - Judy, I thought her name was Trudy. - They're both sick. - There's two of 'em? Boy, I work in a zoo, you work in a circus. It's unbelievable, I gotta go lay down. - What about Marlene? - No, what about Monica? My mother's not using it. - Monica Dent. - No, Monica Chiesa. - What about Destiny? - We're not giving her a stripper name. And no, it starts with a D. - No, no, no, Destiny because she's destined to be special. - What about Maggie, you know, Homer's daughter? - Does it mean anything? - It's Greek, it means pearl. - What do you think Homer? - Sometimes I just wanna be on a train and I'll be looking out the windows and see the trees and the broken backs of buildings, just like in a dream. - A train. And it goes into a tunnel, a really dark tunnel. And the train is a thousand cars long. - But it's beautiful and so dark but I don't know, beautiful. - Going on location, huh? Oh I know how that's like. Make yourself at home. - Okay, thanks. - Beautiful isn't it? - It's missing a leg. - No, I think it came that way. - With three legs? - You know what they say, break a leg. Oh the dress? I'm being interviewed later. It's a tell-all, I'm finally coming out with my story. Everything since the whole "Rebel" fiasco. - Oh right, I forgot, they were supposed to film that here. - It would have been my first leading role in my hometown, everything was perfect, but you know how those remakes are, they can never decide which parts of the past to make part of the present. - Didn't somebody die? - Tragedy is all around us Diana. Marlene, have you met my dear friend. - Mom, that's Drew's mother. My boyfriend? - Is she here for the rehearsal? I didn't know Drew was in the play. - No, she's chaperoning. Remember I told you we were going on a retreat for the play? - Oh yes, it takes so much to get it just right. So that it's not a play, it's life. My daughter's gonna be a star. - We should really get going. - Honey can you zip me? I'm sure wardrobe will be here shortly but I wanna be prepared. - Good luck. - Oh, never say that, it's break a leg. - Music? - No. Play retreat huh? - I just want to keep her happy. She doesn't need to know everything. She wouldn't understand anyway, she lives in her own world. - I'll say. So she thinks you're in the community play? - She thinks I'm the lead. - Didn't anyone ever tell you to lie small? - Have you met my mother? - What did she say about your being pregnant? - I tried to talk to her about it but she won't talk about it. She won't even acknowledge it. - That you're pregnant? - She refuses to accept it. - It's not easy to ignore. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm just a little tired. - You gotta keep your energy up. So Marlene, what are your plans after the baby? - I don't know. I guess I feel most comfortable in the library or a museum, places most people don't like to go. - You wanna be an artist? - No, I really admire people who write beautiful poems or paint beautiful paintings but I'm content to just admire them, it's the awe that I want. I don't know. - What kinda mother do you wanna be? - Well my mom sees her life as if it's on stage or on TV but I saw this painting once in New York, it was ornate and beautiful but damaged because it was just hanging there, it had lost its original life, just dead, beautiful and dead. That's how I see my mother's life, like a painting. Something ornate and beautiful but damaged, a woman in gold but you can't touch anything real behind the beauty. I don't want that kind of beauty. Beauty like that is always hidden behind a pane of glass and I want something that you can touch. For me, this baby is hope. I had to be my own parent for most of my life and it was just me and my mom for so long, I don't want this baby to feel alone. That's why I feel so close to Drew, I'm never met anyone who could make things disappear. - He takes after his father, beware the man who makes things go away. - But he makes them come back. I know this might seem odd to you, our arrangement, but I could never have imagined finding someone willing to be this child's father. I don't think I can ask for much more than that. My father made himself disappear. I don't want my child to have the same life I did. - We should probably get back on the road. - Same time tomorrow night. Remember, sleep with your characters tonight. - Hey Danielle. - Hey Teddy. - It's Ted, well for now. I'm still trying to come up with the perfect stage name. Any thoughts? - How about Theodore? - Too old, I don't wanna be doing grandpa roles at 23. Theodore is something you have to age into. - What about one of those classic Hollywood names like Cary Grant, what about Ford something? - Ford Focus. - Bye. - Where's Mom? - I don't know, she's not back from work yet. How's rehearsal? - Good. - What about Karma? - What? - As a name for the restaurant, is that a good name? No that's bad. Unless it's was a drive up and then it can be Karma but with a C. Get it, that's good, that is good? - Wait, Mom had off today. - No, Judy was sick, or Trudy, I don't know, apparently there's two of 'em. Honestly, I'm worried about your mother. It's like we don't even talk any more. I try to talk to her about the restaurant or the menu or share recipes and it's like she's not even there and let me tell you, it is very difficult to have a dream when there is no one there to share it with you. - Is that even Mom's dream? - What? Of course it is. It's the whole family's dream, I thought. Do you even get it, Karma with a C? You know I didn't have to leave my job. We could be out there in the middle of nowhere, chasing factories, I made that change for all of us, not just myself, and no one is willing to sacrifice anything. Do you know how that makes me feel? - I know Dad. - It's your mother, she's the worst one of all. - Have you thought of a name yet? - Maggie. - Monica, Marlene, Maggie, sticking with the M's, huh? - It wasn't on purpose, I just like the name. Besides it would be Drew, Marlene and Maggie. - Andrew, his father wanted to name him Daryl Junior. - That would have been awful. - I know, he was hellbent on having everyone's name start with a D, Andrew was our compromise but Daryl would only call him Drew so Drew stuck. And by the time Danielle came along, I'd given up. - So you let him win? - Some days I think about getting a name change. - I got you something. - What? - It's for good luck. - Good luck, it's broken? - It's not broken, somebody missing a leg isn't broken, it's just somebody with one fewer leg. - I was driving home from work after a late night shift, it was snowing and I could barely see. And there was this deer and it was running, as if it was running with me. The road was slippery but I couldn't take my eyes off of it, this beautiful white deer. And then just suddenly it was gone. I looked around for it, I kept looking, it seemed to snow harder, I could barely see. I didn't know whether to stop or keep going and then I hit something. I know that it was snowing and I know that I was distracted but I didn't see anything. At first I thought it could be a railing, I was even hoping it was a railing. And then I thought, it could have been a human being. I could have hit a person. It could even have been that deer and because it was white, I couldn't have seen it because of the snow. So I get out and I look. I look for a long time. I couldn't even see any tracks. I was sick to my stomach, I mean, I felt so sick, and there's snow falling all around me, knowing I had hit something and there was no evidence of it. No deer, no man. Not even a rock. All there was was snow. Just snow. - Did you ever meet Teddy? - Teddy who? - Ripkowski? - He's in the play with Danielle, why? - He had this idea to make some money, he wanted to sell my urine. - Why would you do that, that doesn't make any sense? - Apparently there are women who will pay a lot of money for it. - For your pee? - Yeah, they use it to trick their boyfriends or significant others into thinking they're pregnant. - Isn't that funny? Some women will do anything to get married and other women will do anything to get out of it. There are a lot of scams on the internet, right? - Yeah, I kinda think that's what it's for. - I got scammed Marlene. - Really? - That's why we're doing this. - The software? - I was stressed out, I got greedy. You know, Daryl has us pinching pennies for that damn restaurant. He's not even thinking about Danielle, her college, how we pay for it, how she gets there. Drew's fine, he's got a big heart but Danielle needs help, she's just too worried about other people, making them feel safe, she's too much like me. I wanted to do something for her. I just think it's so unfair to trick me like that, I mean, that's maybe the cruelest thing you could do to someone. I guess it's my fault, I fell for it. Got blinded by the money. Or really it was hope. - Teddy's the father. - It's so nice to see you too, it has been quite a while, hasn't it? But I felt it was important for my voice to be heard, it's been far too long, people must think I'm a ghost. No, not like Ibsen. Well I have been planning a new performance, but the future is just so uncertain. - Have you seen Marlene? I need to talk to her. - Excuse me a moment. - What a pleasant surprise. We need a proper introduction for our audience, this is Jim Stark, my leading man. - What are you talking about, who are you talking to? I need to find Marlene. - I've always admired your intensity, this is why he was always bigger than life. - Mrs. Church. - Ms. Church. - What are you doing, this is crazy, where's your daughter, is she okay? She's not answering my phone calls. - Please Jim, we're in the middle of an interview, let's get back to reality. - Her car is gone, did she go somewhere? - My daughter? My daughter is also a star, she'll be in the local production of Ghosts, she's on a retreat soaking in the fruits of nature, to use as her raw material. - A retreat, she's not even in the play. Everybody's in their own fucking cage. - Ah Jim, so full of that passion. There is, in every acting moment, a time when one must lose the self so utterly and so devastatingly that you will never find that person again. And that's what losing a child is like. - What do we do now? - Welcome. - What's going on here? - Were you expecting someone else? - Is this 1482? - Year or address? Come on in, come, come. Come in, sit. - What do you know about identity theft? - Nothing. - And everything. - There's two of you? - There's two of you. - Did you send this to me, are you Janus? - Depends on what it is. Depends on who you are. Quality logo. - Great font. - Does anyone else live here? - Should they? - Just us. - For now. - Well, certainly not ours. - No, certainly not ours. - This is the right address, isn't it? - Of course, we wouldn't live anywhere else. - How long have you lived here? - Quite some time. - Yes, we've lived here for all the time we've been at this address. - And how long is that? - Oh dear, it seems like it's been forever. - What are your names? I'm Marlene, this is Diana. - Nina. - That's a nice name. - Oh dear, it looks like you need some help. - Are you lost? - Somebody took something from me and I thought this was their address. - We haven't taken anything. - No, no, in fact, I cannot remember anybody from this address, taking anything from anybody ever. - Where did you get this? - I don't know, it had to do with something beginning. - Or it had to do with something ending. Can we get you some tea? - Okay, sure. I don't think this is what I was looking for. - I'm really sorry Diana, it must have been a fake address. - That's just my luck I'd get scammed and brought to the middle of nowhere to meet two bizarre twins. - They're nice though, maybe a little confused but I like them. - Maybe a lot confused, they can't seem to remember anything. - Well they're a little bit older, that happens when you get older, doesn't it? - Yeah, maybe. - At least you're not injured. - Yeah, I guess I still have my memories. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I don't know what I'm gonna do. - Me neither. This is really hard. - Tea ladies? - It's gotten quite late and you've come from so far. Why don't you spend the night? - That's all right, we'll get a hotel. - Nonsense. - Maybe we should stay, we can't exactly afford a hotel. - Oh dear, there are no hotels even close to here. - Tonight, you stay with us. - In fact, we've already made up your rooms. - Thank you, that's very generous. - How could we turn you away? Your baby needs a place to dream. - Dream? - Yes, babies dream inside the womb. - About what? - Well, about us. - Place a spoon underneath your pillow, to collect your dreams. - Is that true? - No but it keeps the spoon warm. - Does that train stop around here? - Oh it drops off all kinds of things. - It's how we get snow and sleep and dreams. - Never fall asleep inside the train though. You'll wake up in another world. - I don't mean to be rude but you don't make much sense. I'm sorry, you have to understand, I've lost everything. - That just means it's time for you to find something new. - Now look at that luscious belly. - Can we touch it? - Of course. - This is your room. - Slumber deep. - Sleep, sleep, sleep, this is where you will dream. - It's beautiful. - The edge of the world. Oh the train's arrived. It is about that time. - What, this is the train? - Is this a joke? - No joke, it'll bring you whatever you need, and take you wherever you need to go. - As long as it's not away from here. - But it's a toy. - Of course it is, what were you expecting? - We heard a train, there must be a real train around here somewhere. - This is real. - Departures are so often premature. - One must squeeze everything one can from an experience. - The train teaches you that. - You should not be in a hurry. - Do either of you dance? - What? - Sure. - There's beautiful music in the woods. - Perfect for dancing. - There's so much beauty here. - It's a shame you can't see it all. - You're welcome to stay as long as you like. - The rooms are already made. - I'm sorry. - Up early I see. Did you have a pleasant night of dreaming? - In my past life I think I'd stopped dreaming. - Will you be leaving today? - I think so. - I'm sorry that we couldn't give you what you were looking for. - I hope you found something you need though. - I don't think I wanna leave. - What? - I can't explain it but I think I need to stay here. - You're welcome to stay. - Until there is nowhere left to stay. - But what about your family? - All my life, I felt a longing, but I've never felt deserving. Like things I've done in my life kept haunting me. I keep seeing myself drowning in a blizzard and for the first time I can see the other side of that. - We are always taught to yearn, as if a part of us is absent. - I can't be a half any longer. - Life is all about unfolding. You can unfold here. You can give birth here. - Give birth, I'm the pregnant one? - That's exactly why you must be on your way. And why she must stay. - We will leave you now. - This is crazy, you can't stay here. - You can't stay here but I have to. - Mother, give me the sun. - What do you say? - Earth mother, who do you think I am? And who is it that deranged the world so? A drowning man grabs whatever he can, especially a drowning woman. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. How do you love somebody? There's fennel for you and colombines, what kind of girl do you think I am? Yes, but, I need a person who can be tender and dear, a person who doesn't run. I know it's crazy, terrifying even, but it always is. We all wanna love somebody. All the time, we're always looking. And it seems so simple. Why does it always seem so simple?
