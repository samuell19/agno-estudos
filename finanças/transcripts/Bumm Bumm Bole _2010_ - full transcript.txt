Vegetables! Vegetables! -Flowers! Vegetables! Vegetables! Run! Run! l had a dream. l drowned in it. A dream with open eyes. l looted stars and starlets in the dream. Fill your pockets with it. Let's run away. Let's find a new world. The clouds are dancing. Dancing to the tune of lightening. Dancing with a rhythm. With anklets on their feet. These moments shouldn't be lost. Color the world with new colors. Color the world with new colors. Color the world with new colors. The wind is slow. With the burden of fragrance. The wind is slow. The fluttering butterflies. Carrying the fragrance of flowers. The rain is melodic. There is a zing in the atmosphere. Let it stay. Don't meddle with it. Color the world. Color the world. Color the world. Color the world. Color the world. Color the world. Color the world. Color the world. Color the world. Color the world. Come. Come on, Keshto. Come quickly. Excuse me, my muffler is up there. Thank you. Kalyani! Give me my tiffin. l've a lot of work at the factory. l won't be able to come back here. Listen! Go with Bohoni in the evening. l'll be late. The children will be waiting. Okay? Okay. Ball! Ball! Pass it to me! Binu, pass it to me! Pass it! Binu! Pass it! Here! Binu! Half my salary is used for the house rent. l'd asked him to wait for a month. Sure, he'll listen to you. You're.. What about your salary? Did you get anything? No. Master said he'll give it on Monday. Why on Monday? He doesn't intend to give it. As far as possible, he wants to block our payments. Where were you? ls this the time to come home? l'd asked you to come at 6 other'clock. lt's 6:30pm now. lf you roam around this way, you won't get food. l send you to such an expensive school. What do you think? Your parents pluck out money.. ..instead of tea leaves? You don't care for my hard work at all. l've told you so many times to study.. ..and become a doctor or an engineer.. ..and get away from this stricken life. But you don't want to listen.. -Why are you getting so angry? Why are you standing here? Pick up a book and start studying. Come on! One two three four five six seven eight nine ten. Rimzim, from today, you must eat early and sleep early. From tomorrow, school is at 8am. -l hope you remember. Otherwise, you'll go in the afternoon as usual.. ..and school might have closed down by then. l won't give it. You don't write with a pencil, you eat it. Khoki! Take this box to the post office immediately. Post office? l'll waste half a day going down and coming back up the hill. My work.. -Forget that. This is more important. The tea specimen must be sent to Mumbai. The people in Mumbai will then send it to America. This is the address in Mumbai and here's the money. Register it. Okay? Register it. Bring back the receipt properly. Come on, go. -Go immediately. Go. Where were you? Everybody took money and went away. Go to the office quickly. There? -Yes. Come. You took really long. Where were you? Have you eaten? Or will you eat with me? Give me the money, sir. l'm in a hurry. Don't worry about the money. Alright. l'll increase your salary. Rs.100 per day. Are you happy? Where will you go in the heat? lt's cool here. Take a nap. Take care of yourself. Your hands have become dry. Give me the money, sir. l'm in a hurry. You don't understand. Everybody has a right to a luxurious life. You too. Come. -Leave me. Save me! Save me! Save me! Save me! You rogue! -Leave. Leave me. Kalyani! Kalyani! Kalyani, what happened? You rogue! l'll cut you into pieces. You won't dare to touch my wife. l'll shoot you before that. l can get a gun too. lt is easily available. l'll kill you. Throw him out. He and his wife should not be seen.. ..here from tomorrow. To hell with your job. Leave me. Scoundrel! There is no point. What's the use going to the police? Those rogues will say she was playing a charade. So, she was thrown out. How can anybody lie in such a way? We're married. We live a respectable life. Everybody knows it. They'll say you're her pimp.. ..and put you into prison. lt is easy to say so. One world is created by the Almighty.. ..and the other, by these People in uniforms. And in our police station.. ..there are only people from other cities. They should be thrown out of here. Why do you differentiating, Vishnu? A man's destiny takes him places. One is the birth place, and the other is the work place. Both are like our parents. There is no bias. Our nationality is the same. -Who says so? When we go to their cities, don't they throw us out? Or do they let us stay there lovingly? They're not bothered about having the same nationality. Everybody is selfish. Outsiders don't care what is happening here. They make money here and send it to their native place. We, too, must think of our own people. l'll arrange a job for you with a monthly salary of Rs.5000. Look, l'm sensible enough to understand that.. ..the job which pays Rs.5000 to a person like me.. ..isn't a decent job. -lt's futile talking to you. Vishnu! Bani, l don't think Vishnu is working in an appropriate place. Take care. Brother! Please take some money. No, thanks. lt'll be difficult until you get a new job. Return it later. There is a surplus of money in your house. l realized it when l saw cream in the tea. Bye. So, what's the news? The news is that God is busy dancing in heaven.. ..and He's unaware of what is happening in this world. A tractor factory was coming up. But the leaders and terrorists..everybody is evil. They closed it down. Be patient. Something will come up. Serve the food. Whatever was left, l served it to the children. l thought you'd bring rice. l forgot. l was fuzzy ever since l left the factory. Binu! Go to uncle Kurmi's and bring 2kg of rice. Father, he asks for money. Tell him l'll clear all the dues next week. Certainly. And listen.. ..on your way, give those baskets to uncle Lakhi Charan. And bring some vegetables in return. Father. -Yes. My old sandals came apart again. Please bring new ones. Not today, dear. Next week. For the time being, l'll get it stitched by the cobbler. Binu! -Yes. Take these along too. Get them stitched. Take it. Then how will l go to school tomorrow? He'll bring it back today itself. Hello, Uncle. Papa told me to get 2kg rice. That would be Rs.20. Do you've it? Father has asked you to add it in our account. l've been doing that for quite a while now. He's been telling me since three weeks.. ..that he'll get a job sooner or later. No luck until now. lf your father doesn't get a job for the rest of his life.. ..should l provide food for his family? He should at least pay Rs.100 or Rs.200. Look, until l get some money l won't give you any food grains. Understood? Should l take the garbage, sir? -Yes, take it away. You're still standing here? l'm asking you for the last time, Uncle. l won't come empty-handed, henceforth. And father will get a job next week. Vishnu, pack 2kg rice for the kid. Not the 'Basmati' (Superior quality rice grains), you idiot. Give him the rationed rice. lt's kept over there. Oh, God! What have you done? My sister's shoes. -Have l robbed your sister's shoes? You've spoiled all the vegetables. Run away from here! Vishnu! You're still standing here? -What else do you want to knock down? l kept them right here. l kept them right here. Go away! Get going! Boy, why don't you leave? You're still standing here? Vishnu, take back the grocery from him. Come back. Come back. He ran away. Come on. Set the store in order. Pick these up quickly. All this and that. Keep them in place. Did you get the rice grains? -Yes, l brought it. And my shoes? Brother, my sandals? Brother, did you bring my sandals? Yes. Has the cobbler done his job properly? -Yes. l'll go check right away. Brother, where are my shoes? They aren't here. -They're not? Your shoes disappeared from the shop.. ..where l brought the rice from. l searched for them a lot, but l couldn't find them. That means you lost my sandals. -l'll get them right away. Don't tell mother. Please. Pinu! Pinu, where are running off to? Help me cut the wood! Pinu! Pass it to me. -Pass the ball to me. What are you doing, Chintu? -Hi, Pinu. Hey, Pinu. Stop! Pinu, let's play. We've a match with Raka tomorrow. Not now. l've lots of work. Papa told me not to play before.. ..all the work gets finished. Stop, Pinu. Stop. Oh, no. Pass it to me. Buy whatever you want for Rs.20. -Buy whatever you want for Rs.20. Yes, buy it. Buy it. Only Rs.20. Only Rs.20. Who is it? You devil, you came back? Stop! Oh, God! Vishnu! Vishnu! Some listen to a knowledgeable guru. Pinaki? Hello, Priest. Son, are you going home? Wait a minute. l'll be right back. Son, will you do me a favour? Here. Here's some sugar candy to.. ..distribute with the offerings. Tell your father to make small pieces of them. Take this. God bless you. Why didn't you help your mother? Why didn't you come back when she called you? You're always avoiding work. Don't you've any responsibilities? My daughter also helps her mother. You just know how to eat, play and sleep. That's it. Right? You're not a kid anymore. At your age, l'd have to carry rocks for making roads. l've been explaining to you since long. Why don't you understand? Why don't you understand? Are you a dim-wit? Or a fool? Don't you've any shame? Why do you scold the kid all the time? Son, go freshen up and do your homework. Go on. Don't kick it away. Everyone is out to ruin me. Will l get tea? Rimjhim. -Yes, Mother. Take tea from there and give it to papa. There's no sugar in it. What's this for? Take this. This sugar is for the Lord. The priest has entrusted it to me. lf we use it, Lord Shiva will punish us. Rimjhim. -Yes, Mother. -Give him this sugar. Here. l can't even pay the fees. Added to that there's ration and other things to be bought. l wonder how we'll survive this month. 'Brother, how will l go to school tomorrow?' l'd saved Rs.100 and kept it under the sari in the box. Should l use it? Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind? Remember, Rimjhim was unwell during 'Bihu' festival. We spent all the money then. How can we still have that money? You don't know what you're saying. 'Wear my slippers.' You're hard working. You're very dedicated. l'm confident you'll surely get a job. 'Teacher scolds me a lot. She won't take me in her class.' To hell with hard work and dedication. 'Tell her that you've hurt your leg.' 'l can't wear my shoes.' l feel like destroying everything. lt's no use. Work very hard everyday. Live for 60 years. And then die. 'l'll punch you in the stomach.' 'You lost my shoes and then you tell me to lie?' 'Should l tell papa?' They think l'm a goon. Nothing happens over here. One can't even run a factory. We can't do anything. 'He'll go crazy with anger.' 'He will beat me up.' 'He doesn't have money to buy me new shoes.' Maintain some peace in the house. Enough is happening outside. 'So, what should l do? l've to go to school in the morning.' 'Wear my shoes.' 'As it's, l go to school in the afternoon.' 'After school, meet me next to the gate in the lane.' 'We'll exchange footwear over there.' Come. Come on. They're oversized. l won't wear your shoes. l'll fix them right away. Are they all right now? Ring-a, ring-a roses. Pocket full of posies. Kids, tie your shoelaces firmly before jumping. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Yes, that's good. Go back. Come. You come. Take it. 1.. -Oh, no. She fell down. Oh, my God! How did it happen? l hope she isn't hurt. Kids, Sonu fell down because she was wearing slippers. She didn't wear her shoes. l've told you several times that it's.. ..important to wear your shoes. But l'm happy that some girls have worn shoes. You go back. Come, Kishta. You come. Very good. Yes! Yes! Hurry up! Quickly! Hurry up! You took so long. No. l came running from school. Quick. l'm getting late for school. Ma'am, Manu is here. -Come in. You come late everyday. -Ma'am.. Father.. Father? What happened today? Early in the morning, my father fell into the sludge. l was coming to school. He screamed. So l went back. l picked him up. He told me to wash his loincloth. Because he has only one loincloth with him. l was washing the loincloth here.. ..and he was applying balm there. He said, 'How will l wear a wet loincloth?' He told me to iron it. l didn't have an iron box at home. l brought the iron box from my neighbor.. ..ironed the loincloth, sent father to work. And then l came to school, madam'am. So, l got a bit late. -Go and sit. Come on, let's go. -Hurry up. Such chaos. Last night the minister was shot dead. -Yes. There were several rounds of firing too. Last night l'd to go out for a movie. Now, the police have closed down all the movie halls. l don't know when all this will end. Brother, you reached school on time, didn't you? Were you in time for the national anthem? No, l was very late. You'll have to come a bit early. -Early? l came here running. You didn't tell mother, did you? l told you l wouldn't tell mother anything, so l didn't. ls it? -But your shoes are so dirty. l feel embarrassed wearing them. This is your latest excuse. -Really. Everybody's shoes are so clean in school. Big deal. l'll wash them right away. l'll make them shine like vanilla ice-cream. Punni! Where did you keep the matchbox, you wretched girl? Ma'am, you don't understand anything. She keeps troubling me all the time. Binnu, you're dirtying the well water. Go from here! lt was a good job. You know what it was? Taking care of dogs. l refused. How would l take care of my kids.. ..after taking care of two dogs? You'll have to go to the hospital tomorrow. No..nothing much. lt will be fine. When times are bad, nothing works out. How will l manage in the coming days? l don't understand anything. Forget it, dear. We'll not starve to death. Life is more than just starvation. Don't let it get wet. l wanted my kids to succeed in life. So, l got carried away and got them admitted in a big school. Now where will l get fees for the next six months? l made a mistake. A grave mistake. l got them admitted in a big school. But a father has to do at least this much for his kids.. ..isn't it? 'l can't sing.' 'l can't climb up mountains.' Brother..Brother.. -'l can't ride a horse.' 'l can't swim.' 'l can't cook.' Don't worry. Have faith in God. Don't even talk about that deaf, dumb, and crippled man. Where's He? Where's He? What good has He done to us? That Gogai, idiot.. He's living a lavish life by making us work hard. We're loyal. Concerned about our dignity. But we'll die of starvation and poverty. Praying and performing veneration is a fool's charade. God doesn't exist. Neither here nor in the sky. God is just a stone idol. Just a piece of stone. And a piece of stone doesn't do good or bad to anyone. Brother.. Brother.. Brother.. Brother.. What's the matter? -Brother.. lt is raining outside. The shoes got drenched. Then how will we go to school? Mr. Goswami sent you, isn't it? -Yes, my neighbor. He told me. We've work here. But to count wood. We get different types of wood here. And we count them and give numbers. Will you be able to do it? -Yes. Yes. Why are you nodding your head? Have you done such work before? Don't worry. Just give me two days. l'll learn as l watch and ask around. Okay, then start from today. Moreover, we don't have many laborers here. You want new shoes, don't you? Come on, l'll get for you. Where will you get my new shoes from? l've brought new shoes for you. -Who gave you money? l didn't buy the shoes with money. God gave the shoes to me. When did you meet God? -You ask too many questions. Do you want the shoes or not? Yes. -lf somebody asks..if somebody asks.. ..who gave these new shoes to you, tell them that.. ..teacher saw my torn shoes and gave new shoes to me. Okay? -Yes. Where is it? Where is it? -Shut up, father is here. Kalyani! Kalyani! -What? l got a job. Take these sweets. Take this. But don't have them. We have to offer some to God first. You were cursing Him last night. Now you're praising Him so much. What's the matter? l'd lost my mind. An idle mind is a devil's workshop. l cursed God. But now it's proved. You can't see Him, but He always sees us. Brother, you're absolutely right. He favors the good ones and doesn't spare the bad ones. He punishes them. Shoes. -You'll get thrashed now. Tomorrow..tomorrow morning. Veeru! You've stolen my devotee's slippers from the temple! You're a sinner! l won't spare you! l'll thrash you! Where is she? Where's she? -What happened, dear? What happened? -What happened, dear? He would've had a nightmare. Make him drink some water.. ..and put him to sleep. Nothing will happen. Take God's name and go to sleep. Come on, dear. Sleep. Sleep. What happened? Please, don't punish me. l'll never do anything wrong again. Ma'am.. -What is it? What's the time now? -You have a lot of time left. Come on, finish writing your paper. You finished it? Ma'am, shall l go now? -So, are you in a hurry to go home? Go. Hey dear, what's the matter? Why are you crying? My shoe fell into the muck. Don't worry, dear. l'll get your shoes out. Where's it? Oh, it's here. l'll see. Wait, dear. l'll be right back. Don't cry, dear. l'll get your shoes out now. Wait. Don't cry. Come out! Hey, brother! -What? Get the shoe! Get the shoe! Catch hold of it. Where were you since so long? Why have you come so late? l don't want to wear your shoes. -Why? Why is it wet? -lt fell into the sludge. But how will l go to school wearing these wet shoes? How did it fall into the sludge? The shoes are big. So they keep coming off. Yes! You make good excuses. l'd stuffed cloth in the shoes in front of you, didn't l? Then too it comes off. lt is your fault. You lost my shoes. Where are my shoes? Yesterday you said you brought new shoes. God gave it to you. You didn't give the shoes to me. Moreover you're lying. Give my shoes to me or l'll tell mother. And then mother will tell father. -That will be good. You'll get thrashed. l'm not scared of getting thrashed. But father doesn't have money. How can we buy shoes before the 1st? l thought you would've understood this by now. Now, tell me. Will you tell mother? Tell me. 'Bumm bumm bhole (Hail Lord Shiva), the snake sways..' '..and gobbles up whoever lies.' Will you tell mother now? -No. What is your name? ln which standard do you study? Binaki Gwala. 6 B. Where were you? Why have you come so late? Sorry, madam'am. My house is far. Or..did you forget the school timings.. ..while playing on the way? Sorry, madam'am. Yes, madam'am. Why is your shoe wet? Sorry, madam'am. l fell in the sewer. Then how is your pant dry? Sorry, madam'am. The sewer was small. What is this? The sock is dry and the shoe is wet? l hate false stories. lf you come late again, l'll drive you away from the school. Come on. Go to your class. Ma'am, may l come in? -Yes. Will you come to play football in the evening? Silly, it's the final match. What is this commotion here? Didn't l forbid you to talk? The students who are laughing are about to cry. Because the examination results are here. All the students in the class, except seven, have failed. Tarun Kurmi has secured the third rank in the class. Aslam Khan has come second. And Binaki Gwala has secured the first rank. Binaki, come and meet me in the staffroom.. ..after class. Okay? Ma'am, Nandu has come. Our latecomer has arrived. Come. Come in. Tell me. What story do you have about your father today? He sent me to the market to buy kerosene worth Rs.2. The shop was closed. l asked the neighbors. They said the shop wouldn't open. lt was the shopkeeper's wedding. So, l returned home. My father was on the terrace. Father came down. He gave me the address of another shop. l bought kerosene from there and gave it to father.. ..and then came to school. So, l'm a little late. You've come at the right time. Go. Sit. Hurray! The bell has rung! Come on, let's go. Let's enjoy. Hurray! Ma'am, may l come in? -Yes. This is for you for securing the first rank in class. Take it. Thank you, madam'am. -Welcome. Rimzim! Rimzim! Rimzim! Rimzim! Rimzim! Why don't you stop when l'm calling you? Are you cross with me? Or are you upset? Look at this. Take it. l've brought it for you. From where did you get it? Miss Mahanta had given it to me. Keep it. Really? ls it for me? -Yes. Do you know, l didn't tell mother anything? l knew you'd never tell mother anything. 'Bumm Bumm Bhole' (Hail Lord Shiva). The snake sways. Sir, take this. Hey! -Yes, sir? Did Debu come here? -No, sir. l've been searching for him for three days. He has borrowed money, so he's avoiding me. Tell him, l'll find him at any cost. Fooken, order tea for me. -Sure. Babu, make four cups of special tea. Yes, sir. l'll just bring it. Come on! -Hey, stop! Hey! Come on, throw the card. -Here is my card. Three. Yes. -Come on, hurry up. ls Khokiram Gwala here? -Why? Are you blind? Can't you see my uniform? l'm Khokiram Gwala. What's the matter? Do you know Gogai, the owner of the tea gardens? -Yes. Did you thrash him? -No, sir. Did you threaten to kill him? Where did you get the pistol from? No, sir. l did thrash him, but.. -Come on. Sit in the jeep. Sir. -Come on. l didn't do anything, sir. Someone has given you wrong information, sir. l didn't do anything, sir. -Check his house. Bullets, guns, explosives, check what's inside. Sir, l didn't do anything..l didn't thrash Gogai. -Shut up! Sir! -l didn't do anything, sir. Sir, please listen to me. -What's going on, sir? He hasn't committed any crime. -Sir, l've little children. -Sir, we don't have links with anyone. -l didn't thrash him, sir. -lf you don't come, l'll beat you up. -Sir! Sir.. ..l did have a minor quarrel, but l didn't do anything. Sir! -Someone has given you wrong information, sir. Come on! -Sir, where are you taking him? To feed him barbequed chicken. -No. Come on! -Sir, listen to me. Please listen to me, sir. Sir, l request you. Where are you taking him, sir? You go inside. Come on, go inside. -No, sir. lt was Mr. Gogai's mistake, sir. l didn't do anything. Shut up! -Sir! Sir, don't hit him. Sir, he is not at fault. -Come on. Come on! Sir, don't thrash him. -Sir, listen to me. Sir! -Please listen to me. Sir, please don't take him. He's not at fault. -Come on! Sir, don't hit him. -Sir, listen to me. Please listen to me. Sir, don't take him. He's not at fault, sir. Sir, l've not done anything. Students, we know that exams are on. So, please study hard. And make the right use of your time. Many girls have told me that there are.. ..problems in their families.. ..because of which they are unable to study. l'm going to meet your parents too. Come what may, they must give you.. ..a lot of time and the right atmosphere. Don't you waste your time playing.. ..and watching cartoons on TV. Okay, students? All the best for the rest of your papers. Now you may go to your respective classrooms. The first queue will go first. Then the second and the third. One after the other. Hey, Khokiram. -Yes. Yes? Calculate your wages till today. You don't have to come to work from tomorrow. Why? What's wrong, sir? l don't need more men now. Last week you were saying that you're short of workers. Now, all of a sudden.. l don't want to say it. But if you insist, then listen. l don't want a man who is involved with the police. No, sir, there is no police case. The police had taken me only for an investigation. l've not done anything. People are also saying you have connections with terrorists. No! No! No! l don't want to get involved with the police and army. Navin, clear his accounts. No, sir.. l'm a tailor. -l am a tailor. Making clothes. -Making clothes. Stitch. Stitch. Stitch. -l stitch, stitch, stitch. Bye. Hurray! Come on, let's go and play. Let's play. Come on. -You come to my house too. -Come on. Mother. -Oh, darling, it's you! Binaki, come here. Why are you late today? Did you fall into the sewer or the river? Go home. Come on. Go back home. l'm talking to you. Go home and bring your father. Sorry, madam'am. He has gone to work. Then tell him l've called him tomorrow. Sorry, madam'am. He'll go to work tomorrow too. Then bring your mother? Sorry, madam'am. My mother is sick. l won't listen to such excuses. We punish bad students this way. Get out of the school. Get out! Where are you going? What's wrong? -l've been sent out. Oh! Okay, wait right here. Good afternoon, madam'am. -Good afternoon. He's a very good student. He always secures first rank in class. He's very quiet. Binaki, come here. Miss Mahanta has recommended you this time. That's why l'm sparing you. Go to your classroom. Sorry, madam'am. Thank you, madam'am. Father, be careful. Walk slowly. -Okay, dear. The hand-barrow isn't here, it's on that side. Dear, take your father to the market carefully. Take good care of him. -She does take care of me. They don't ask her anything, isn't it? Yes. Their condition is worse than ours. What happened? Khokiram, what happened? Will you tell me something? l've been defamed. l've nothing to do with them. l don't have a single penny. lt's been over a month. l wander around asking for work. Nobody hires me. Everyone thinks l'm a murderer. Can l kill anyone? The police took me away for a day.. ..and everyone thinks l'm a terror.. l've two kids. Oh, God! There is no God. -No, you shouldn't say such things. Kids have nothing to eat. What should l do? Yes. Here are my younger brother's belongings. He joined the army a couple of years ago. l've some tools and this.. Yes, here's a pesticide sprayer. Was he a gardener? -Yes. All these tools are rusting. You can take them if you want. Won't he need them? Now he won't. He has been posted at the border. l wonder when he'll come back. Yes, when he was here he'd go to the city with the tools. Rich people have houses with big gardens. He'd work at four to five gardens everyday. He earned handsomely. l'll also go to the city early tomorrow morning. Kid, it's Sunday tomorrow. Your school would be closed. Right? Yes. -You come with me as well. You'll waste your day playing, anyway. You'd better come with me. You'll learn the ways of the world. Come on. Put everything in the bag. Come on. Get down. Rich people live here. We should ask for work politely. l hope there's someone at the gate. Otherwise, we'll ring the bell. They've an intercom here. When we ring the bell, they'll ask.. Who is it? What do you want? l'll say, l'm Khokiram, sir. They'll ask, Yes, Khokiram. What do you want? l'll say, l'm a gardener. Does your garden need to be tended to? They'll say.. You'll not interrupt while l'm talking. Ok? They'll say, Yes, come in. There's work that needs to be done. The door will open. l'll do the mowing.. ..spraying of pesticide or putting fertiliser. You'll help me. Okay? You're still too young. Just do as l tell you. Understood? 'Who's there?' Madam.. Sir.. -'What?' 'What do you want?' Well.. 'Must be a civilian.' Speak. Speak. -'Speak. Who are you?' Speak, Father. Speak. Well, gardener.. 'Soldier! -Yes, sir.' 'Bring my rifle.' Run. Run. Run. 'Hurry up! -Sir.' Anybody here? Excuse me! Father, run! -Run! Father, run! Run! 'lnsolent! You've come now?' 'Does your cow give milk in the afternoon?' No. -'5 other'clock has given way to 6 other'clock.' 'Six to seven and seven to twelve.' No. -'Madam doesn't want you to deliver the milk. Go away.' No. The medicine.. -'You fell ill again.' Gardener.. -'Wait. Wait, l'll teach you a lesson.' 'First, you mix water in the milk.' 'And then you come and ruin my afternoon nap.' 'Come. Come for your money and see..' We're not milkmen. We're gardeners. -'What?' Trimming the plants, adding fertiliser.. ..spraying pesticide and cutting the grass. We do all these things. 'l'm the gardener here. Will you snatch my livelihood?' 'l'm the gardener here.
