'Girolimoni. The Monster of Rome' Not this one. He doesn't like them like that. Come on, children. This way. Get in. You're too well dressed. You're too pretty. If we don't catch this man soon we'll all go crazy. - A child alone? - The parents are criminals. She looks alone. They're using her as bait to catch the monster. - They're finally doing something. - There are 500 of them around Rome. Sure, orders of Mussolini. Punctual. They caught the monster! I saw him! Let's bring him to justice! Come here, they found the man who killed those children! Good, like that. Let's go to the police station! They're coming! Sentence him to death! Sentence him to death! Who saw him take a girl? Come forward if you saw him! You, come here. You want him to get the death sentence? Then give us a statement. - How do you know he's guilty? - They're all saying it. Let's listen to her, you were shouting so much before, now you're quiet. Did you see him? The voice of the people, the voice of God! Enough! Go home! These gatherings are illegal. Drink some water. Water? Yes, give me some more water. - Looks like you got lucky. - And if it went badly? Release him as soon as possible. They can't let him go! He isn't a man! Five! He killed five little girls! And two of them were family, my cousin's daughter and my niece. He killed them and sucked out their blood. And they want to give him a trial? A trial as well? Give him to me! - I say they should shoot him! - Shoot him? Give him to me! - What would you do to him? - What would I do? What would I do? I'd put up a post in the middle of the square... and I'd tie him to it. Then I'd call the mothers of those poor little girls... and I'd put a knife in their hand and I'd tell them... Cut him up! Piece by piece! Chinese water torture, until he's dead! Until he's dead! What do those bastards want? Calm down. To the death! Let me talk to those fools! To the death for what? For nothing. Who am I? Christ? - If the Commissioner finds out! - What do we do? Call the fascists. The fascists are coming! That's how you gain respect for authority. Fear of authority. Maria, hurry! Did they make you angry? Drink, drink, it's good for you. Mind your own damned business. - That's my place. - Like I didn't know. - Who ate my food? - Like you don't know. You don't touch my things... I'll kill him! He's got to respect me. You have to respect me! - Is it ready? - No. Beautiful. Beautiful minx! You quarreled with Spartaco again. Forget about him. We'll get married. We'll live together. I'll take care of you. I'll make you live like a Roman prince. Dirty! I'm already a Roman prince. Dirty bastards! You shame me! It's the coachman. I want to settle the score with everyone! I want to talk! Open your windows! Are you hiding? Open up! The coachman wants to talk to you! Where are all the ones who wanted to kill me? Show yourselves! I want to look them in the face! I know that death is a step that chills the heart, as the poet says. But you... You sentenced me! I'm innocent. May my soul weigh on your conscience. For seven generations. Down another litre. That's vetriolo! The coachman killed himself with muriatic acid! Bastards! It's your fault! It's your fault! Keep the noise down, she's asleep! Still awake? Beautiful angel. Uncle's little angel. You made me suffer. What has it cost me to bring you into this world? Tarquinio! Open up! Come out of there! Come out of there or I'll kill you! Damned murderer! I'll kill you! I knew it was you. How could you? Go to the tavern. Show yourself. Did she beat you? What has Tarquinio done, Armanda? Nothing. And you want to marry him. Jesus! Hurry up! Rosetta. Rosetta! Has anyone seen my Rosetta? He's taken her! He's taken my little girl! Help! - He's taken her daughter! - When? Now! - Nobody can leave the area! - Why? He's kidnapped another girl. He's kidnapped another girl. He's kidnapped the girl on Corridore street! The corner by the greengrocers. Search everywhere! Arrest him! You stay there. Check them as well. What are you doing? Bring him in! Let them through. Press. Rosetta, my girl! She was sleeping, like an angel. I went to get some wine. I left her sleeping with the door open. Two minutes. Two minutes and I come back and she isn't there anymore. She isn't there anymore, and the pee in her bed is still warm! We can't go on like this! Is this the order fascism promised us? Silence! You see, Parini, with the door open... Out of the way. Anyone walking past could have seen the little girl's bed. Yes, perhaps. I don't really buy the idea of someone walking past by chance. That man knew he'd find a girl in this house. It's someone from around here. They came in here because they could. What are you talking about? The door was closed. It was open. It was open because you opened it before. Be quiet. - Where are you going? - Let me through! - They're my relatives. - You can't. I'm family. Everyone back to the barracks! - What happened? - They tried to kill Mussolini. - Is he dead? - We don't know but we must arrest the criminal. - What happened? - They tried to kill Mussolini. Is he dead? He's alive! You may enter, your excellency. My compliments, excellency. The police are allowing me to be used as target practice. - Duce, we caught him. - Who is he? We didn't have time to question him. Nobody could stop the overwhelming fury and justice of the Black Shirts. 'Who touches il Duce dies' You've caught the culprit. But not the monster. I would have preferred the opposite. An assassination attempt increases the glory of fascism... but a criminal like that on the loose lessens its prestige. Duce, the people are asking for you. Let them simmer for a while. Do you know what those people want? That vague illusion of freedom? No. They want a leader, and to be protected. I signed a contract with the Italian people and I intend to honour it. I order, I repeat, I order that this criminal is captured immediately. Yes, Duce. Capellini, send orders to the press... that the headlines call for the reinstatement of the death penalty. We must seize the moment. I won't accept any more errors. Your excellency will answer to me personally. Italians, Romans, Black Shirts of the revolution. The plotter's bomb hasn't for one moment accelerated the beating of my heart. To those who make me the object of their dogged ballistic attention... believing they can intimidate me. I solemnly declare that it doesn't even pass through my brain... - You're leaving, excellency? - Dear Barbo, I have my own problems. The crowd is tamed. - What are you saying? - You can't come today. - Is she sick? - No, the master's returned. - And when is he leaving again? - The lady didn't tell me. - Did she say anything about me? - Nothing. She didn't even say; "My Gino, how will I survive without you?" No. "Waiting a day will render our meetings more exciting.", she didn't say that? No. - She gave you a message. - No. I get it. Well, she knows where I am. Tell your lady she can call me if she wants. - Where are you going with all that? - Piazza Navona. You look like a Sicilian donkey. Get in, I'll take you. It's like a merry-go-round. Ever been on one? No. And don't work too hard. Think about having fun as well. It isn't the devil, you know. Ninetta. Your hand. I said your hand! - Who was that man in the car? - I don't know him. - What's his name? - I swear I don't know. - Where does he live? - I swear I don't know. - What does he say to you? - He just says hello. - Did he say he'd be back tomorrow? - No. No? No dinner tonight. These common folk are so good at pretending. I didn't hurt her. She was playing it up. Either that man's a thief looking for information from servants... or something's up and Ninetta's bringing messages. To whom? The lawyer's wife upstairs? She may be pretty but if I were her husband I'd kick her out. On the pavement. Where she belongs. Or perhaps that man's been bothering you? Men only bother those who allow themselves to be bothered. I want to know why that guy's hovering around Ninetta. - He likes Ninetta. - She's a child. - Do you think he's a pervert? - How do I know? Then it's our duty to intervene. I wouldn't want Ninetta's body to turn up in a field in the suburbs... like those other poor children. We would be accomplices to a horrible crime for not speaking out. Just don't let Ninetta leave the house alone. No, he must be punished. Then he'll stop hanging around. You agree that man has to disappear, right? You never photograph me, Gino. You told me you were waiting for your new dentures. - They're expensive. - Then we'll do it serious. It's not like there's much to laugh about these days. Excuse me, the bull's getting restless. Look at this! And who's this mysterious beauty? Married. And you still see her? Actually, I think it ended today. Not because of me? I don't want anyone to suffer. It often hurts to continue. Do you love her? Drink your coffee it's getting cold. Are you the kind of guy who could fall in love with someone like me? - I don't think so. - Why? You're too intelligent, loyal... and with a hint of honesty. And I only fall in love with idiots. I know they're idiots but I still fall in love with them. It's a psychological thing. Maybe I'm an idiot. Gino, would you take a photo of me like this? With or without a hat? - Tell me. - Not everyone can do that. Nudes are important. You've got to have a talent for it. Look at the history of art, Milo's Venus, La Maja Desnuda. Why? Aren't I good enough? I'll measure you. I'll hide myself. Don't confuse them, photography is one thing and work's something else. First we'll do the photographs. Take off your skirt. I'll do a nice blow-up with a nice frame and you'll put it in your parlor. Then you haven't understood that a nude is art. - Blood and Sand. - These are dirty photos. I don't know much about art but I know a bit about dirt. - Hold still. - Easy with your hand. - Still or it will move. - You're telling me. Well? How much do these dentures cost? What's wrong? I was reading about that man who killed those little girls. How can someone do that? We've all got a bit of the devil in us under lock and key. Obviously the lock broke. I've got three little nieces who can't even leave the house. I can't sleep thinking about that monster. Monster, it sure is a frightening word, but what does it mean? Let's go and eat. All that bull fighting has given me an appetite. Bring them all in. Take your hats off. Now each one of you will unbutton your trousers... and one by one you'll see the doctor, okay? - Why? - Genital examination. - What does that mean? - That's none of your business. But it is our business! This pointless exercise again. - Anonymous letters? - Nothing useful. We didn't hurt any children! Every now and then you have to put the squeeze on them. If anything a thief might pop up. One thief more, one thief less. I'm telling you he's the monster! I've been watching him for years, night and day. Why are you doing this? I didn't know you were so cruel. Don't let him fool you! - What's going on? - Nothing, his wife's a lunatic. - And him? - Yes, I'll deal with it. Listen, we get reports of men bothering little girls every day... but they usually know their names, where they live. All you know is he has a car. License plate? I can tell you it's a yellow car. I read in your statement that your maid is thirteen years old. Perhaps you don't know that the killer has never killed a child... older than four or five years old. Look, our girl looks a lot younger than thirteen. Okay, let us know if he turns up again. Parini, this bulletin is quite clear. Orders to use all means possible and impossible! - We can't. - Why? They're impossible, you said so yourself. You always complicate everything! It's in your blood, damn it! However... He kills periodically, right? Every six months, more or less. Seeing as we can't find him... Unfortunately our only hope is that it doesn't happen again. People will forget over time. I dreamt I was at home sleeping. And I woke up because someone was trying to break in. And the key was turning in the lock. And I felt like I was a little girl, three or four years old. - And I knew it was him. - Who? The one who kills little girls. First he beds them, then he kills them. I was tucked up in bed and I tried to get up, to escape. And I couldn't move. I said to myself, "He'll come in, and he'll kill me." - Can I get a coffee? - Coffee at the bar, just wine here. How much for a soft drink? He wanted to bed you and you wanted to escape. You'll never get another chance. I'm going to smoke a cigar outside, I'll leave the girl here. Ask that girl who that man is. - Who is that man who's with you? - My father. He's her father. I heard that the monster hypnotises the girls... and makes them say what he wants. - Where do you live? - In Giordano Bruno. Let's go. Give me something to drink. - Send the kids outside. - Let's not bother tonight. It's raining outside. - Send them to bed. - No, they pretend to sleep. You watch, don't you? Out. Come on, hurry up. I'm worried about the girl. I'm going to see if they've finished. They'll hit you, don't go! - Will you let me in? - Go to your auntie Sorina! - I'm going to auntie Sorina. - I'm not coming. - Come with me. - No, I'm staying here. You're Piochetta. Have you seen a little girl? She's my daughter! She went out for a moment. He's taken her! He's taken my daughter! Maybe it's that guy who bought the soft drink. I saw someone! I gave her a soft drink. She was in my tavern ten minutes ago. With a man! Then he's the monster! I saw the monster! I saw the monster! He's taken another girl by Fico square. It kills me to think of her mother. It's your fault. You should have been watching me. Did you watch me? No, so what do you want from me? Where did you put her? In the reeds under the baskets. Tomorrow morning I'll go to Aventino and get some grass. We're crazy, we're watching without doing anything. I don't like it. They'll kill us if they find out. We'd better kill him and end this. If you touch him I'll kill you. Dirty whore! You were meant to watch him, that's why we were going to let you marry him. - The asylum, then. - Asylum! - Your brother? - Yes, my brother! Quiet, if they hear us they'll kill us. I'll report you for all the robberies you've done. Let's cut our losses and report him. Yes, then everyone will find out we had the monster in our house... and nobody will buy anything from us, not even a chicory leaf. - No, we do this my way. - What do you want to do? Nothing. Marcocci, it's your turn. They're the witnesses. Marcocci, you have to tell me if this is the girl... who came to your tavern with a man last night. Sure, that's her. What's that? A page from a foreign language book. Now you have an exact description of this individual. The detail about the northern accent, the strange left eye, the mustache. The fact that he keeps his money in his left pocket. It's hardly conclusive. Let's finish this. He said the left eye. This is his right eye. I want to know where you were last night? I was at the tavern with some friends. Why? Is anyone with a funny eye a suspect? Send in the next one. Nobody move. Is this where I show my dick? What are you doing? I'm surrounded by lunatics! I've got three balls. What will I get? If we mess up this time Mussolini will make us pay dearly. Our lives destroyed, a career ruined because of a crazy lunatic. A vile being we could crush without any uproar. We'll be out on the street. Don't you think about that? I think about it, commissioner, I think about it. Is it possible that there isn't one. One of those criminals... With all the lunatics walking the street! Isn't it possible to find one... One, I say! Sure, we need someone. That unknown. The one that engineer reported. We don't know anything about him. Except that he has a yellow car. And it's a foreign make. There can't be many yellow cars in Rome of a foreign make. I'm a journalist for il Messagero, I've always gone to the morgue... - How and when I wanted. - The authorities are inside now. I repeat, you cannot pass. Arturo, I brought you a gift. A photo of your little niece. - Here she is. - Thanks, Gino. Isn't she beautiful. - That's a great gift. - He's a friend of mine. Photography, what a great invention, it's magic. Modesty aside, I use a Zeiss lens. I fought against the Germans, but you can't touch their cameras. How do they make you feel? They make me think of friendship. A friends' dormitory. Ignore me, my imagination's running riot. Who's inside? The authorities are here. Let me see my daughter! There they are. They're the centre of attention for the first time. Photos in the newspapers, articles all about them. - Notoriety is a great comfort for pain. - Finally a cynic, I like you. Me, a cynic? No. I wanted to say that lots of children die from neglect and nobody notices. But if one those poor sewer rats is killed by a monster... then they're poor little angels, innocent creatures, etc... I agree, but they're exactly the kind of words I'll have to use, that move people. There's more, for the parents, people who never had anything in life... a tragedy like this, that's so special... It's almost a privilege. If you ask me some people even envy them. They got lucky. Not a bad story. But who are you? I often see you at the paper. I go there to get news for my work. I'm Girolimoni. Gino Girolimoni. Bad, isn't it? You can't go in! The gentleman's a journalist for il Messagero. I've got nothing to say. The professors do the talking. I just prepare them. You've been doing this for years and you know more than anyone. I wanted to clarify the issue of rape. Take my word for it, it's impossible to rape a five year old. They call it rape just to say something. - To get attention. - What does he do to them? You want to know what that shithead does? What do priests say? That the origin of sin is there. Between the urine and the excrement. So he sticks his finger in their vagina... One in the anus, and then... He peels the skin off like you do to a chicken. You have a real way with words. I won't stick around for the ending. Two builders, one injured. the relatives are over there. I'm Gino Girolimoni, I work with the best lawyers, if you need me... - What do we have to we do? - You should read this form and sign it. Can I have a word? Tell me. - Our cousin had an accident. - He fell off some scaffolding. - Fell or thrown? - Fell. - Where are you from? - Civita... Castellana, precisely. You've built houses and vineyards in your villages with your false claims. - Sorry, I'm not interested. - But he's dead! It happens, when you miscalculate. Are you calling us liars? Dislocated thumb. I won the case for you 4 years ago. I didn't notice you'd done it on purpose at the time. Dislocated thumb, heel in Civitavecchia, fracture in Civita Castellana. I know all the tricks, I was a builder myself. Be good, find someone else, I'm not keen on jail. Who does he think he is? He's left us out on the street. When will we see some money? - Very soon. - How will we eat? - I'll give you a loan. - Thanks. Want a sweet? One for you, and one for you. Say thank you. Say hello to the best lawyer in town. - It's a new cloak. - But there's an old peasant underneath. And I don't feel like getting tricked by a peasant. Especially one who grew up an orphan. It's true, I was an orphan. So you should respect me because I could be the son of a king. You'd still be a son of a bitch. In that case, given your mother's profession, I could be your brother. Don't try anything. They're watching us. You're stealing all our clients! You were at the morgue this morning. How did you get in there? Where does it say I have to teach my competitors their job? Girolimoni, either we work together or... And don't show off, I've got some fine knives... In that case I'd better tell you... You know people don't like what we do. I went to the morgue, the authorities were there, and nobody said anything. - Why? - Why? Because I was a rifleman during the war. So what? It may not seem like much. But there was a corporal with me in the trenches and I saved his life once. Let's see if you can guess who that corporal was. Rifleman, done well for himself. And today bombs don't do anything to him, as you've seen. - Benito? - Mu... Benito Mu. Who's going to touch me now? - That's bullshit! - Then try it. Forget about him. Gino. Sergeant. Long time no see. My compliments, I see you're making new friends. Those guys are dangerous. If I'm not mistaken, at the front you used to say by any means necessary. Getting out of trouble using the name of the head of government. It's a name that produces miracles these days. I work like a mule and I got myself a car. - It's yours? What do you do? - I find clients for lawyers. Legal assistance for people with work injuries. - Is the job legal as well? - It's a humane job. - The families are grateful. - And the employers a bit less. - I bet you've travelled far in this. - You like it? It's the latest model. It's almost Grand Prix. I bet it's fast. Almost 60, if I push it. Now you're here, in ten minutes the suburbs. - Does it work with the ladies? - Irresistible. They don't look at me, they look at her. Want to try? I'll take you wherever you want. I remember everything we suffered together. - Where are we going? - To the precinct. Yes, I'm in charge of public safety now. It's perfect. - You don't do a thing. - Are you married? - I'm still a bachelor. - At your age? I've got five kids, but you've always liked the good life. No, unfortunately I've always ended up with the wrong women. - Let's say I like my freedom. - A bit of an anarchist. More anthropometric. What do you think? Now I know where you are, I won't promise I'll come and visit. How about a coffee? Come and have one in my office, then you'll see where I work. A dirty office, underpaid work. - I'll never own a car. - You have other satisfactions. In Naples they say they it's better to give orders than screw. - You know your dialects. - No, I like Neapolitan. It comes instinctively. - Have a seat. - Thanks. - Would you like to change places? - I don't like giving orders. - You prefer to screw. - I confess. - Ever had a moustache? - No, it makes me look like a mouse. - You had one in the war. - Yes, but that was to scare the enemy. In fact, we won. How much money have you got in your pocket? You want to punish me. That old routine. But I've got it now. How much do you need? I'll be glad to give you a loan. Do you always keep it in your left pocket? That's my right. Perhaps it's your left. Why did you squint? Yes, perhaps you're nervous. Are you nervous? - About what? - I don't know, maybe it's this place. But you have got a defect under your eye. Listen, I've also got a small birthmark on my tummy, a liver problem... and an allergy to napping after a meal. Wouldn't it be easier if you told me what you want? You're almost making me feel guilty. Remember that time in Civita? When that little girl walked past... and you said, "That one there, in a few years she'd be good now." Do you remember? Sergeant, I'm a busy man. Thanks for the coffee. Where are you going in such a hurry? I get it, perhaps you're going to offer some sweets to some little girls. I prefer experienced women, nothing under twenty one. You understand? But you made some obscene proposals to Engineer Iacarino's maid. You got her in your car, put your hand under her skirt... - You unbuttoned your pants. - Interesting, and I was there as well? If the car wasn't driving itself you were there. - Who are you trying to screw? - Don't call me sergeant anymore. I'm brigadier Amichela now. That isn't my fault. Come on, hurry up. They always cast me as a woman in school plays. Women, virgins, nuns... I always looked like a whore. Getting rid of your moustache won't help. Let's go. Excuse me, this is my scene. Bring in the first witness. - Hold on, my moustache fell. - Hurry, put it back on. It's him, I recognise him. Who did you recognise? Tell us. - It's him. - Which one? Go closer and point at him. She pointed at the officer. If I may? The witness identified Girolimoni. I saw her clearly. - Be quiet! - Let him speak. I was in the same position and the woman identified Girolimoni... at the precise moment he raised his head above the counter. Commissioner, may I? I'll remind you of two things. First, there's a promotion for anyone who helps catch the murderer. Second, there's a reward. And that may encourage many citizens to give a false testimony. Very well, her testimony won't be included in the statement. Proceed with the next witnesses. Bring in Marcocci. Girolimoni, come forward. You with the moustache, leave. Come closer. Careful, Marcocci. Do you recognise this man? Marcocci, a fine Roman name, honest. - Yes, that's him! - I got it wrong. Go and get Anna degli Angeli. Stand up. Anna degli Angeli, you're still needed back at the station. Go with the brigadier. - Careful with her. - Why? She's a born liar. Wait here. Come in. She's the only girl who managed to escape from the monster. Come closer. How do you know that the man who wanted to take you to the cinema... really was the one who killed those girls? For two reasons; the way he spoke to me and the way he squeezed my hand. I'll never forget that hand. And what did he say to you? Come on, tell me. "You're very pretty, that's why I chose you." And how did you get away? It was a moment, an inspiration. I thought of the Virgin Mary and I said; "Mary, save me." I felt a great warmth inside of me. - Like a fire in place of my heart. - A fire? - Yes, in place of my heart. - Yes, we understand, go on. So I felt that man let go of my hand... and I found myself free in the middle of the street. The Virgin Mary saved me. I'd put this thing about the Virgin Mary in her statement. What do you think? Prepare for identification, brigadier. If we assume that victims have terrible tissue lacerations... Then Cacarini is right, manipulation without sexual assault. Cacarini isn't qualified, he's just a trainee. A lack of sperm can be explained by premature ejaculation. The anatomical genital picture here is within normal limits. If we observe the dimensions it's above the average. - What do you do? Measure dicks? - Cut it out, Girolimoni. As you know, perverts attacted to children... have an almost childlike genital tract. Do you have to study a lot? The development of his member can cause degeneration. I know a girl who never studied but has considerable experience. Quiet, you. In this case one certainly can't talk of a sexual deficiency. He certainly doesn't show signs of infantilism. Don't fall in love because it's not happening. You know there are others who say they can identify the monster. Some of them do it for the reward. - I'm doing it for justice. - Good, I'm sure the money means nothing. - It was dark, it was night. - That doesn't matter. You saw him clearly, and you're someone who tells the truth. I think we're going to see your photo in all the papers. Get back. Go on, have a good look at him. Hello. How are you? It's him! I feel a fire inside. It's his hand, I recognise it. Take her away. Well, Girolimoni? Do you still deny it? Excellency, I have something to say if these gentlemen aren't offended. Go ahead. I was just thinking... - Is this what you always do? - Do what? Your investigations, interrogations. The inn keeper only identified me because he wants the 50,000 lira reward. As for the girl, poor thing... Instead of examining my dick why don't you examine your brains? A notable speaker. No, I feel sorry for you, you're going to look foolish. All of Italy will be laughing at you. How will you explain it to il Duce? He won't let you make a fool of him. - He bites. - Remarkable ability. Yes? At least I'm good at something. Admit it, what have we got? Nothing. - What more do you want? - I want proof or a confession. He'll confess, it's just a matter of time but he'll confess. May I? Let me question him. I know how to make him talk. I know him. You've been identified. You can't deny it. You have the car to take the girls' bodies out of town. They saw you pick up a little girl. They found lots of costumes at your home. Jockey, race car driver. Clearly disguises. Damned 127th battalion. A windy morning. Austrian shrapnel everywhere. We were about to attack. The regiment flag coming up over the horizon. An outline like a signal to the enemy. And in that fatal moment, I called you an asskisser, remember? When the action was over I got a medal and you got nothing. Do you want my medal to leave me in peace? Are you selling medals now? It's since that medal that you started looking at me strangely. - Jealousy. - Me? - Of you? - It's strange but it's true. And now the car. You won't forgive me for having a car. I'll give it to you. Do I look like someone who can be bribed? - We all have our weaknesses. - But I'm not a child rapist. It isn't rape, get your facts straight. - He penetrates them with his fingers. - How do you know? - Because I'm not ignorant like you. - How dare you? - And get off your high horse! - What should I do? Kill myself like the coachman? No. I have patience. I've been through worse than this, sergeant. This wine isn't bad. I've had worse. These photos of girls were found in your room. Recognise them? - I took them. - How do they make you feel? - How should they make me feel? - Are you trying to be smart? I'll do whatever you say. Just tell me how I should feel... Do I have to faint, cry? This is one of the photos you took of Lungo Tevere. It just so happens that one of the girls' bodies was found right there. - How do you explain it? - There are two possible explanations. It's either a fluke or a coincidence. Laura Carlini. Carla Santini. Marisa Telli. Rosetta Tirabosco. Isa Matei, la "Piochetta". How do these make you feel? I didn't take them. Why won't you confess? If you confess, with a good psychiatric report you'll avoid a life sentence. Besides, you're also an orphan. Do you see? Just tell them your father was a degenerate. You'll be fine, you're not to blame, you're irresponsible. Listen, you've got to clear something up for me. I could understand if you'd done it with a girl who was a bit more... You know, each one of us... But so young? - I like them small. - Yes? The smaller they are the more I like them. - What do you like about it? - It's hard to explain. They're abherations. - The last one, for example... - Piochetta. I was driving past, she lifted her skirt, gave me the eye, I stopped. She smiles at me and says, handsome gentleman... Will you give me two lira? And I reply... If I give you two lira, what will you give me? She replies, give me a ride and you'll see. And then? I let her get in. She sits next to me. Starts touching me. Aren't you handsome, she says. I like you. Take me far away, I want to make love to you. - So young? - No! I take her to a field. She starts to undress, I reach for her... No! Wait! She gets out of the car and starts dancing. - Dancing? - She danced around me, and laughed. - She laughed. - Naked? Naked under the moon. - And then? - Then, nothing. I got out, she started running around the field... - How can I put it? - You attacked her. I held her, threw her down on the grass. And I lost it. You know, completely naked, her tiny body... Slender, delicate, with two boobs like this. - A six year old girl? - No, a 32 year old dwarf. - But you were talking about Piochetta. - No, you were talking about Piochetta. I was talking about a dwarf. It excited you, didn't it? Are you making fun of me? Dirty son of a bitch! You won't break me, Sergeant. Now we'll find out if she was a dwarf or a girl. And no marks on the face. - Has he confessed? - Not yet. - What are you doing? - He's doing his best. - You didn't leave any marks on his face? - No, just a broken rib. - You can't see it. - Shall we proceed with Iacarino? Bolduini's calling me all the time. He's anxious to give the news to the head of the government. It's your turn soon. Don't lie, admit your guilt, and don't embarrass your mistress. - I'll have them put you in prison. - You're hurting me. That's enough, don't exaggerate. - Well, Girolimoni, how are you? - I could be better. I had a lively discussion with your colleagues... Bring in the witness, Iacarini. Proceed. Tell me, my child, when he followed you, what did he say? Compliments. - Did he ever caress you? - Yes, once. Did he ever invite you to get into his car with him? Yes, once, he even gave me some sweets. Then what happened? I ran away. You must excuse her, she comes from simple stock. And you, madam, didn't you notice anything? Yes, but I thought he was a salesman. They sometimes come asking for information about the families, to sell something. I understand, and how long did this last, madam? - Actually, I... - A month. She confessed. - Did you also hear her confess? - Yes, in fact we were worried. We're responsible for Ninetta. Girolimoni, you admit it? - What? - You lured her. Do you think I'd admit it if I did? - An intelligent answer. - Thanks. Then why were you following the girl? That's my business. I'm not worried. Sooner or later you'll realise you've made a mistake. We've got to try and get out of this mess as clean as possible. Right, madam? Girolimoni didn't provide a justification for being with the maid. Because he didn't want to compromise Mrs. Iacarini. A Don Quixote, perhaps, but not a monster. If you had more experience, my dear Parini... you'd know that many criminals are intelligent and likeable... just like our Girolimoni. I may not have the experience but thank god I don't have any prejudices. Saying you don't have any prejudices is already a prejudice, dear Parini. You've been critical of my behaviour since we started this investigation. And with all due respect, sir... The truth is, you'll accept any testimony... to justify your accusations against Girolimoni. That man has been identified by Anna de Angeli and Marcocci. If you want my job, try coming up with something better... and don't invent a love story between Girolimoni and Mrs. Iacarino... who's an honest woman. You call a simple logical deduction an attempt to undermine you. - Then find me another monster. - I know where to find him. The Tirabosco girl was taken from inside her home in two minutes. That man knew. He knew he'd find a girl in there. Either he's a friend or a neighbour... or even a relative. That's absurd, why don't you say it was the father? Calm down, gentlemen! I ask you to accept my immediate request for a transfer. We'll discuss it later, for now I'm taking you off this case. But it's him, precisely because he won't confess. Angelini, if those witnesses retract their statements... they'll throw it out for lack of evidence. But the details are quite clear. The funny eye, the moustache, the money in his left pocket. Angelini, I risk a reprimand but they'll send you to Sardinia. Now Mussolini is the Minister of the Interior and responsible for the police. We can't involve him in a mistake. Just wait for him to confess. He won't confess, he's a pervert. He laughs and jokes, he's demented! He's crazy? Then let's take our chances. Prepare a press statement. I want a meeting with the head of government, it's urgent. Eight columns on the front page and an exclusive! We got it! What does it say? The elusive child murderer has finally been caught. They caught him! They caught him! My boy, come here. It's over! They caught him! We can't leave Tarquinio alone. We've got to watch him. Thank you, in the name of fascist Italy, for bringing this individual to justice. - Brigadier, what were you in the war? - Sergeant, 2nd Rifle Regiment. I'm also a rifleman, lance corporal, which makes you my superior. But now you're a Marshal, for outstanding service. I'm well aware it can't have been easy capturing that man. - What's his name? - Girolimoni. That will do. Names have an inescapable destiny. Girolimoni. Makes you think of something slimy, torturous... Sick! If he'd been called Bianchi or Rossi they'd soon forget him... but I say that name is enough to nail him to his infamous destiny forever. In fact, he dared to use his sick intelligence to make fun of us. When the man and girl entered the tavern Piochetta hadn't been kidnapped yet. He was still near his home. She was kidnapped half hour later. And then, let's say Piochetta was the girl in the tavern. Do you think a monster who kidnaps a girl, who's about to kill her... takes her to a tavern to buy her a drink. Why look for logic? He's a degenerate. - What about the disguises? - The mania of a failed actor. Do you really think he disguised himself as a matador to kidnap his victims? - He photographed lots of little girls. - He photographed everything. Think about it, Girolimoni is a crime story that's been blown out of all proportion. Why? Because on the wave of public opinion... they want to introduce the death penalty in Italy. Why? Because, when you have the death penalty for common offences... they'll also make us swallow it for political offences. - Opponents of the regime have been warned. - There's no place here for anti-fascists! There's always the truncheon for those who dare oppose il Duce! I can understand them attacking workers on strike... But here? We're civilised people, right? This has been going on a while. I tried to protect you... because you're an excellent journalist, it's in the blood. But I can't anymore. You're not even a member of the party. The newspaper's my life. You're throwing me out? Look, I can talk to Savinelli. He's a good kid. But you've got to do the right thing. Get that damned membership card. It's the same mistake again. The Marcocci tavern isn't on Via Monte Brianzo, it's on Via Gilaudo. I prefered to stay. Not for opportunism, believe me. It would've been easy to slam the door and go, too easy. But fascism's here now and it's going to be here for a while. You've got to work within the system to humanise it. - Will you get your membership card? - I think so. Right now it's the best thing to do. I agree. In these last few months the nightmare in il Duce's heart... Il Duce's paternal heart... has suffered along with all the father's in Italy. - I want to speak to... - Over there. Good morning. Make him repeat exactly what he said. Will you repeat exactly what you said earlier. I'm the one who went into the tavern on V?a Giraldo... with my daughter to ask for a drink. Let's go! - The moustache. - The northern accent. The left eye injured in the war. And they live on via Giordano Bruno, like the girl said. We've got to do something or we're all in trouble. - Mussolini doesn't mess around. - Just stay calm, and silence. Let's go and talk to this idiot. So, Romanuti, you've thought about it, you were drunk. Drunk? I only drink coffee. I tell the truth and you lock me up! Is this what you do in Rome? - Did someone pay you? - I wish! I'd buy some new trousers. Are you a member of the Socialist Party? - What's politics got to do with it? - Then why wait ten days? I already told you! The newspaper said he went into the tavern on via Monte Brianzo... But when they said it was on via Gilaudo I thought of me and my girl. It's not my fault, it's the press. I thought the papers told the truth. - How do you know it was that day? - I took my brother to the station. You can ask my brother, he's a soldier in Udine. You can check his leave papers, they're stamped and dated. Check it out then send him home. Send his statement to the magistrates. If you say one word I'll throw you in prison and I won't let you out! - Now they'll ask for our resignations. - I'm not resigning. - They wanted a culprit and we found one. - But it's the wrong one. Let the chief of police deal with it. We're merely subordinates. Comrade Boldrini, resignations don't exist under fascist rule. Fascism is a trench where you don't argue, you obey. Duce, I'm not deserting but I'm also prepared to pay in person. And you come here after all this time to tell me that man won't stand trial. What are the risks in this trial? Girolimoni is sure to be absolved. And that, after we've told all of Italy he's guilty, will make us look... Like fools. - And what does your Excellency advise? - Get rid of the witness. The dead can often be more trouble than the living. In that case, have him committed. This would prevent a trial and serve the national interest. The national interest isn't a fig leaf to cover up your Excellency's blunders. I won't risk a scandal that might divide the people and the regime. - How long has Girolimoni been detained? - Eleven months. He was found in possession of pornographic photographs. Obscene acts in public. Release him. Then all of Italy will know Girolimoni's innocent... - and the real monster's still at large. - They won't find out. Girolimoni must cease to exist as a 'news man'. It's a new expression. Fascism is also revolutionising our language. It means the press must completely ignore Girolimoni... and anything that refers to the monster. If another girl is killed, just don't write about it. Because if what the press writes is important... What it doesn't say is even more important. Look who's out. Home at last! Even you look good today. You're not even going to ask me what prison's like? - Give me my key, I'll tell you later. - We're full, Gino. You haven't been full since you opened the hotel. There's a new manager, he wants six months in advance... to give the hotel some prestige. The hotel's a sewer, the only noted aristocrat was me. - It's bullshit. - You have to understand. - You have to understand. - I get it. You know what? Tell the manager the rooms are damp... the corridors are noisy, the porter hasn't got any teeth. I'm changing hotel. I'm changing hotel, and you learn to play. Shut up, fool! Maybe you're Girolimoni? This is my niece! - You called? - Who are you? It's strange you called me if you don't know me. - Who are you? - Girolimoni. I meant the Girolimoni who's in jail, the one who killed those kids. - I didn't kill anyone. - I believe you. You're a gentleman, he strangled twenty of them and sucked out their blood. How do you know? Did you see him? It was in the papers! "The many faces of Gino Girolimoni, child killer, master of disguise" "The criminal was also a waiter" "The peoples' generous hearts rejoice after killer arrest" You don't have the right! Where are you going? Come here you! "The Child Killer" "The Human Beast" "Rome Freed From The Monster" Great! - That's what everyone thought. - This is today's paper. Where's the news that I'm innocent? Where is it? Show me! "Catastrophic collapse on the New York Stock Exchange" Who cares? You should have written, "Girolimoni Innocent!" "Girolimoni Rehabilitated" This big! Come with me. - I want headlines. - You won't get them. At least for now, our orders are very clear. You've ceased to exist as a news story. They just did you a favour. Because the fascists can't admit their mistakes. So much so, they've taken away the freedom of the press. But these are exceptional times, it won't last long. I'm sure the King will intervene. Only then will it be possible to have a real rehabilitation. You'll see, with the passing of time, people forget. No, I've got an unforgetable name. - Look at them. - Forget about it, don't be so cocky. How am I meant to live while I'm waiting for them to forget? For now, change your name, and go back to work. Life goes on. A loan, as a friend. A man of your vitality, in a month you'll have a new car a beautiful woman. Are you really such an expert on life or are you just pretending? Don't worry. 'Morelli', I'll baptise you, it will bring good luck. So, Mr. Morelli give me your new address. We can have dinner together, maybe with a couple of pretty blondes. Let's hope this Mr. Morelli still wants to make love. - It will all be settled in a month. - A month? How will I manage? I'll give you a small advance. I'll send it to you, but don't worry, lawyer Volantonio is very good. - Are you Mr. Morelli? - I'll be right with you. Good day. Paoletta, weren't you meant to wait at the cafe? When they see a woman alone they immediately start to bother her. - Do you mind me coming here? - Not at all, I've finished. Goodbye. Where am I taking you tonight? I thought we'd go somewhere quiet. - The countryside again? - Don't you feel like it? Yes, okay, if you don't want to see anyone... but you promised we'd go to the theatre, remember? Right, Petrolini, I even got the tickets, we're a bit high up. Great, anyway I've never been, it's the same to me. Then tonight you'll see a great actor. I already have a lawyer, it's Mr. Morelli. You know what Petrolini says? "The people, let the people play." What times we live in. - I can't go dressed like this. - What's wrong? Yes, perhaps you should wear a mask. I'll miss the show with those eyes. They'll all be looking at you and Petrolini will get angry. - It might finish late. - So what? What do you mean? Your parents? I told mum and dad I was going to the theatre with you. You told them. They said, at least let us meet him. Right, we'll have to deal with that as well. - And if they say no? - Why should they? - You never know. - If they say no we'll run away. You know what this dress is missing? Something to... A little touch. Let's see. - It looks better already. - How much did it cost? Nothing, today's a special day. That isn't Mr. Morelli. Is Girolimoni here? We missed you! It's great to see you again! Yes, Girolimoni, he's with that woman over there. Yes, it's me, Girolimoni. That guy who was innocent, say it. If you're innocent how come no girls have been killed since they arrested you? What do you mean they don't have the right to insult you like that? - They called me Girolimoni. - Isn't that your name? It was a name. Now it's become an insult. They say it like it's an offense. And I'm pressing charges for defamation. Have you got a form I can fill in? You're laughing? This is no laughing matter. - I assure this is no laughing matter. - Okay, I'll let you go this time. No, don't close your eyes. Your eyes are there to see. I'm here, if you close your eyes you can't see me anymore. Have you got that form? You can't talk to me like that. You're the chief architect of my ruin. You've got to open your eyes, and your conscience. You can't treat me like this. I'll show myself out. I'm not giving up. I'm going to punish you! - You're threatening the Commissioner? - Why? Would you care if he died? Sonia, it's Girolimoni, that guy you know. I'll see you tomorrow, Brigadier! - Who is he? - Girolimoni, the child killer. Remember that nude photo? That was their excuse. They stopped me and questioned me for days. They were angry because I wouldn't say anything bad about you. Gino a degenerate? But he likes pussy. He's normal, too normal. I should know. I've arrived. - You work here? - It's first class. I like it here. I always liked you, I can come back to your place if you want? Why? I can't even enter a brothel? - If the boss recognises you. - You're right. Tolerant, yes, but up to a certain point. Who cares about the boss, let's make love! No, I don't want to compromise you. I leave a trail of blood. I'll dirty everything. Don't be like that! You've got to fight back! I'm trying do my best... but it's like they're all in on it. Listen, do you want to marry me and become lady Girolimoni? - I've already got someone. - You see? I've got to find a way to eliminate this trail of blood. See? It's blood. Clean it later. Gino, if you need anything. No, no charity. One might get offended. How did it happen? He said he was a relative and he took the little girl away. But who was he? Who? What do you mean, who am I? I'm the monster. Don't you remember what you wrote in the newspapers? - In God's name, what are you doing? - There, in the name of God, do as I say. I want headlines in the papers, everyone has to know I'm respectable, if not... If not, there's no God anymore. I'm begging you, don't hurt the girl. Let me hear her voice. - Don't get all weepy on me. - I have tears in my eyes. Right, it hurts when you're crying for yourself. When others cry it doesn't matter. Everything's fine, conscience, mood, digestion. And I have to cry my entire life to make you laugh? No! I'll call back in five minutes, and you give me the guarantees... or there's no more God. The phone call. Will you buy me some mostaccioli? - Listen, have you got any mostaccioli? - Yes. - They won't hurt her? - No, it's made for children. Maybe sweets are better. Ask her? - Sweets or mostaccioli? - Mostaccioli. Come and watch the film, uncle. Why don't you ever come for dinner at my house? Will you come today? - Watch the kid for me. - Sure. You're asking the impossible, it isn't up to me. I'm willing to give you enough money to change city. To move to America. Are you listening? - I'm listening. - I'll pass you Di Meo, you trust him. I'm listening. I'll read you a government memo sent out to the press six months ago. Particularly gruesome cases that may upset national morality... must be ignored by the press. Are you listening? From now on there are no more monsters in Italy. - We've all become good. - Exactly. On the orders of the government. From now on the authorities decide what's good and bad. Come and get the girl at the Astoria cinema. Good morning, everyone! How are you? Are you okay? Isn't water great? Put some wine it. What have you got today? Oxtail stew? I really like it and you never make it. When are you going to stop this? For the 50,000 lire you got from the police you can feed me till I die. You're already getting on our nerves. I get the impression you don't like me. Marco, I was a gentleman, I had a job, a car. And beautiful women, too. Do you think I like seeing you? Or do you think people actually like you? And her! I recognise her! I even recognised her without her moustache. 50,000. - Did you put a drop of oil in it? - Put a sock in it. I kept my money in my left pocket, now it's all gone. I'll be back on Saturday for tripe! I like it with mint. Girolimoni, don't you remember me? 4th wing, Regina Caeli (Jail) Lucky you, Girolimoni, you're someone, at least you can eat. Come here. - Another plate. - You bringing guests as well? Just an empty plate. We'll split it. Eating too much hurts. I've lost my appetite. I see this isn't coming from the heart. Nice? It would have been better with a drop of oil. I didn't invite him! I've tracked down the real killer. Let's go. His name's Proder, German. I heard whispers at the police station. He's been reported for child molestation. It finished there, without anyone remembering the fragments. What fragments? Those pieces of paper found near Piochetta's body. They were fragments from a prayer book, written in German. I'm the only one who connected the two clues. Fragments found at the scene of the crime... and a priest who molests little girls. Where are they going? Come out of there! Come here, little girl! Come out, you! Out! Where are you going? Come here! I caught you! Filthy pig! - Don't do anything foolish! - Where did that girl go? - Calm down, we've got him. - Come here, little girl. How do you say girl in German? - You're coming with us. - Wait, I want to talk to him. A priest as well? Do you know who I am? I'm the one who paid for you. I paid for your crimes. You ruined my existence. You're not a priest, you're an executioner. Executioner! You destroyed my life. Because of you I'm finished. My life, "Kaput". You're the monster of Rome, now I'm going to kill you! - Save it for the trial. - Let him go. Let him go! He had nothing to do with it. You're letting him go. Why? He had nothing to do with it, he's just a dirty old man. - The fragments, in German. - He doesn't speak a word of Italian. How could he lure a girl in Rome? - In fact, the girl was German. - He's got the habit. What have you found out? That people do bad things? Who am I then? Someone who should pay for the sins of the human race? If we called out to people, they'd arrest him, don't you see? He's the perfect person. The front page, a priest! Everyone thinks priests are a bit like the devil, especially in Rome. If not the Italian newspapers, the foreign ones would have been talking about it. With contacts in Vienna, Paris, or London. - But it isn't him. - But it could be. What does "It could be" mean? Here, I'm "could be". You see? - Do you want to lift this curse or not? - Not like that. I won't do to him what you bastards did to me. When will you stop playing with other people's lives? - I was trying to help you. - No, you want to clear your conscience. Or another headline; "The monster of Rome is a priest, this time." Don't complain to me anymore. Fools! You're all fools! Throw away your pens. You do more damage than anything else. Look this way! Look this way! I have to give him a letter! They wanted to give you a military trial. - I explained your case to them. - Think you can help? You're getting old, but I'm not. You know why? Because I live intesively. As il Duce says, an officer must be elegant, correct, and ferocious. Don't change anything because I think you've made it. - We're against the easy life. - Why? Get in, I need to talk to you. A plea to il Duce. Pathetic! Il Duce can't look at individual cases. What counts is the state. Only then will Italy become a strong country, respected overseas. I've got the same problem. Overseas doesn't bother me. I want to be respected here. Just Rome would do. I might have the right solution for you, if you're up to it? You make me laugh! One day they'll kill the lot of you! Clowns! You know, Girolimoni, the good citizens who reported him... have requested and obtained the honour of participating in the firing squad. What are you up to? - Clowns! - Brigadier! What's going on? God! Long live freedom! Long live anarchy! They're crazy. What has he done? Long live anarchy. Death to tyrants. Don't you realise you're a servant? - Clown. - Quiet! I'll do it. Servant. Think of your own sins. Are they serious? What is it? Scared? He was an anarchist who sneaked back into Italy with the intention of shooting il Duce. - Just the intention. - He admitted it. What would you have done to him if he really had shot him? I caught him, you know. Without me il Duce wouldn't be alive. - See how you get into the history books? - And how do you get out? I wanted to offer you a chance to get into the military. With a uniform like this everyone would have respected you. But you're not the same man you were in the war. What are you doing? You're turning pale. No, it isn't about courage, it's here. I can't get this thought out of my mind, here. Every time I see you it comes back. - It's the urge to spit in your face. - If you do I'll kill you. And that's why I haven't. I've decided to live. I thought I was the unluckiest man in the world, today I realised I wasn't. - Stop! - I want to see how it ends. - Get out. - Gladly. Men like you, walk. Sergeant, you see you got your car in the end? Go! "Death Penalty" "Avenge the Innocent Victims" "Save Society" - Who do they want to kill? - They captured the monster. Which monster? The one who killed those three girls in Ostia. - Like Girolimoni. - Who's Girolimoni? - Don't you remember? - No. The one who killed those girls in Rome thirty years ago. - He killed seven of them. - All at once? - One at a time. - This one killed three but all at once. But Girolimoni was innocent. It was a terrible miscarriage of justice. - Then who did it? - They never found out. Some say it was an English priest. - You got a cigarette? - No, I don't smoke. - If you give me some money I'll buy some. - Sorry, I'm in a hurry. It was for political reasons. Listen, listen... If you give me 100 lira I'll tell you something extraordinary. That famous Girolimoni, that was me. I'm Girolimoni, the one who was falsely accused. - Okay, it happens. - But I was innocent. My brother-in-law, almost got arrested over a car accident... and he wasn't even involved. It was all hushed up for political reasons. Mussolini was jealous of me and he buried me. What a great camera! - Are you journalists? - Yes. I've got important news about a friend of mine who's dead. - Who's that? - Girolimoni. - Giro, who? - Limoni. - The one who killed those kids. - He's dead. - He was innocent. - It's still a great headline. - It's old news. - Nobody cares anymore. I used to be someone! I had my time! Everybody knew me! I was a famous case! I was the monster of Rome! You got that? I'm Girolimoni!
