[whooshing] [water splashing] [soft, tense music] [birds cawing] [birds chattering, frogs croaking] [distant dog barking] [indistinct radio chatter] [camera shutter clicks] [♪] [camera shutter clicks] [news reporter] The body of an 18 year old girl, Tracy Myers, was found this morning at the local reserve crossing in Perth Eastern Hills. [news continues indistinctly] [bright music] [water rushing] [♪] [choral singers enter] [music fades] [bikes rattling] [boy] Leave your bikes here. [birds twittering] This is the place. Over there, that's where they found her body. [ominous music] That's Black Bobby's house. [boy 2] Do you guys really think he did it? That dog should be locked away. Yeah. It doesn't make any sense. It's right next to his house. Why would he? [boy 1] He's a dumb Abo, not a master fucking criminal. I don't know. I'm not sure if I buy it. Then you're an idiot. The whole neighborhood knows he did it. Don't ever come here alone, Chris. Especially at night. [bird cawing] [♪] [can hissing] [soft electronic dance music] Hey, Savvy! What's going on? That's it, man, it's all soon. Nah, I'm bringing it to you. Yeah, yeah. Hold on. -What's going on, man? -How are you, dude? Doing all right? -Good, good, yeah, good. -What's up, Sav? So where's Phoenix at? -He's out back. -Out back? -Yeah, he's getting on it. -[laughs] That's the way. Talk to you soon, yeah? Catch ya, man. Yeah. Catch ya, man. [indistinct chatter, laughter] [music increases volume] [♪] -[man] Yes! -[screams] Well, look who's come out to play. Look at this skinny prick, huh? Who would have thought we have the same mom? [water splashes] -Don't soak me bro. -Hey! Oh, poor little man, eh? When you gonna let me teach you how to fight, soft cock, huh? -Huh, huh? -Yeah, yeah? [both grunt] [brother] Light. You taught me how to tag. Ooh, big man still scribbling on walls. Yeah, we lit up Black Bobby's house. Stay away from that blackfella's house, all right? And why are you still hanging out with these dickheads for? Come on, Phoenix. We're up for anything. For real! Probably couldn't get your dick up, for real. Ah, come on, Phoenix. You know I'm cool. I know you're a dickhead. Settle down, eh? Settle down. Two dole bludgers and a computer nerd. The three fucking Stooges, eh? Temporarily unemployed. I'm still a student. So you go to uni or something then? Huh? I said you going to uni or some shit? Yeah, nah, I'm still at TAFE at the moment. Um, I want to go to uni some day though. Yeah, you look like you would. I laid some bricks the other day. [♪] Dickie Dale is here. What do you wanna do? -Is everything okay? -[Phoenix] Relax, wee man. -Let the prick in. -You sure? [Phoenix] Just make sure he behaves. Keep an eye on him, boys. So, what's going on tonight? What's going on? Everything's going on. You know it. My bro, the big man. [dramatic music] [sniffs, exhales] [echoing] Screw you, bro. You got some for me? Yeah. -Help yourself. -Yeah? Yeah. [water splashes] -[grunts] -Back off! Brotherly love.

[spits] He could have fucking killed that guy. Fucking Dicky Dale. He deserves it. Shut up, Angus. It's none of your business. Well, I'm just saying. Yeah, well, it's Phoenix's hood. He can do what he fucking wants. [rock music playing softly] I got to get going. Already? See you's later. What about the beautiful ladies? You go for it, man. I've got an early start tomorrow. Catchya. [bus drones, hisses] [dramatic music intensifying on laptop] [woman] You got some cool effects happening. Sorry? Got cool effects. Thanks. To be honest, I haven't even really started my doco. How's yours going? Yeah, getting there. Nearly finished the rough cut. Are you serious? I haven't even decided who I'm going to interview yet. Who'd you do? Ah, Rechelle Hawkes. Oh, Bob Hawkes' wife. [woman] No! She won gold medals for the Hockeyroos in Atlanta, Seoul, and Sydney. Well, that's impressive. Hockey's a tough sport. Sure is. See so many people walk away with smashed faces or lose their teeth. Well, you still got a beautiful smile so... What? What? Sorry? What, can't a guy give a girl a compliment anymore? What's your thing with smiles then? [clears throat] I just appreciate a good smile. That's all. People say that the eyes are the windows to the soul but... I think a smile tells you a lot more. People can fake smiles though. Yeah, but even a fake one still tells you something. So does a nervous smile or a cheeky smile. A confident smile. Any type of smile. But the best one of them all is the simple. A confident, not too confident, nothing to hide, content with myself kind of smile. Okay then. Thanks. You're welcome. Hey, do you wanna maybe get a coffee or something? Sure. [woman] Oh, like next to Midland? I grew up there actually. I went to school there. All my friends are from there. Maybe one day, I'll even get out of there. What's the rush? It's an interesting neighborhood, you know? Few tough guys around. I'm not really a tough guy. Right. -Where are you from anyway? -Uh, Claremont. Ooh, fancy pants. It's not like Dalkeith. Yeah, okay. What school did you go to? MLC. Oooh, Methodist Ladies College. That's the one. Yes. Methodist Ladies College. That'll be $30,000 a year. Thanks. What is a Methodist anyway? A type of Protestant. Are you a type of Protestant? I'm not a type of anything. [light piano music] [birds twittering] [ominous music] [crow cawing] [♪] [crow cawing] [Shane] What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Looks like he got our message. Time for round two. -'Til he cracks. -[Shane] Yeah. 'Til he either cracks and confesses for the evil he committed or packs up and leaves. Either way, we win. Whoa. I just saw him come home. It's okay. We'll be stealth-like. -You'll be stealth-like? -Yeah. -Are you serious? -Yeah. [tense music] [cans hissing] [dog barking] -[door slams] -[Bobby] Oi! Fuck, run! [♪] -[bell chimes] -[boys panting heavily] You think he saw us? What's wrong? I think I dropped my wallet. [Shane] Fuck. What do we do? [insects buzzing] [Angus] Your ID in that wallet? Looks like we're gonna have to go in and get it. Guys, seriously. It's gonna link you back to the graffiti. I'm not going inside there. That's all right. We'll just wait till he leaves. [tense piano music] [children chattering distantly] Stay and lookout. [♪] [fabric ripping] What are you doing? [Shane] What do you think I'm doing? I'm looking for your wallet. Well, that's not going to fucking help. Shut up and keep looking! [whimsical music from game] [tense music resumes] [can hissing] [truck rumbling] Shane, come on. My wallet's not here. -Let's go. -Just a moment. [Chris] Come on! Gimme a sec. [dramatic music] Oh, shit. He's come home. [♪] He's coming around the back. Front door, front door, front door, front door. [key jangling lightly] [Shane grunts] [♪] -Come on. -[Bobby] Oi! [Chris] Come on. [music stops] [soft piano music] [boys panting] Thanks for the warning, Angus. Check your phone, idiot. [Shane chuckles] That was fun. Fun? How was that fun? What happened? This psycho started tearing up the whole place. Not enough. Well, did you get the wallet back? -No. -Fuck. Fuck! Now he's gonna know what I look like and where I live. He's gonna come after you. You're in deep shit now, Chris. You know what? This whole thing was the stupidest idea ever. Hey! You're the one who dropped your wallet! We were just trying to help! [♪] [cars passing] [pulsing music] [man laughs] [indistinct chatter] [man] Boy! [Phoenix] Don't worry about it. What should whispers not worry about? [knife clangs] Fucking Dicky Dale. That piece of shit. Fuck this. I'm out. You know you should be careful, mate. Here we go. Tell me why. Huh? We don't need any more heat. Eh, fuck counselling and overthinking shit. Action is what counts! You with me, boys? -Yeah! -Yeah, boss. Yeah, fucking oath. You gotta show it to these junkies. They don't fear you, they rise up. This isn't "Planet of the Apes," mate. Oh, really? Thank you for pointing that out to me. You know, I didn't know that. You want my opinion? The objective should be business as usual. If you want business as usual, go become a fucking accountant. Ain't no diploma that's gonna school you up for this shit. Business as unusual. Fucking chaos. It's how we do it. That's how we live. You know, for a violent sociopath, you're actually strangely poetic. All right. Violence-free day then, huh? [man] Oi. We got company. Looky here, Sav. Got ourselves some important visitors. Good afternoon, detectives. Big party last night, fellas? Having a party wasn't a crime last time I checked. Saw that Dicky Dale's a bit black and blue today. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you, fellas? That'd be right. [sighs dramatically] Fucking Dicky Dale. Wouldn't let that clown anywhere near one of my parties. Not our fault he's a degenerate with lots of enemies. We're actually here to ask you a few questions in relation to the murder of Tracy Myers. Again? Yeah, again. We have reason to believe that our young victim was buying from another local supplier. Four weeks pass, you guys have still got nothing. You coppers must really be desperate. I'd love to help you out and all. Really I would, but I'm actually clean at the moment. Can't risk it. With parole and everything's coming up, you know? Those parole protocols can be a bit over the top sometimes, can't they? What do you say we, uh, loosen things up a little bit? You know what? That is such a good offer, it almost makes me want to get back into the business. Well then? You must be a little deaf. All right? Come on, fellas. This is your chance to do the right thing. The right thing. Yeah, right. The right thing would be for you guys to do your own fucking jobs. Pardon me. You know, I could have cut a deal to reduce my time but, uh, do like a dog to you? -He's not a dog, officers. -That's right. -He ain't no dog. -Ain't no dog. Yeah, I might not be a saint. That, I know. But I'm definitely not dirty. Thanks for dropping by though. Always good to see you. Wait, officers. Lamington sandwich? [solemn piano music] [train pattering] [train hisses] [Angus] Chris-o. [Chris] Angus. [Angus] TAFE today, huh? [Chris] Yeah, yeah. What are up to? [Angus] Nothing. No work on. Haven't seen Black Bobby around. [Chris] No, I haven't left the house since losing my wallet. [Angus] Well, you see that panel van, just bolt, bro. Cheers. Good advice, Angus. What's wrong? [Angus] Mom changed the locks on me. -Again. -[Angus] Yeah again. Why? She hates me. Always has. Ever since Dad left. That and she found my stash. Damn. How long is it going to last for this time? [Angus] Don't know. I'll figure something out. Look, you're more than welcome to stay at mine 'til you figure things out. Thanks, Chris. [phone chimes] Shane. Yeah. What does he want? He wants us to go back to the crossing. Why is he so fired up about this Bobby guy? It's like he's got a personal vendetta or something. Shane used to be on and off with Tracy. Tracy Myers. They were together? Shit, he kept that quiet. Didn't want Phoenix finding out. Why does that matter? Used to get on the gear all the time. Phoenix found out and went mental. Went crazy. Pulled a machete on Tracy. Scared her off or something. So who was she getting her gear off if it wasn't Phoenix? [Angus] Dunno. Neither does Shane. Not like he cared though. Had the booty blinkers on, you know? Yeah, but how do you know Phoenix wasn't selling her gear? Why would he sell to her and then scare her off? I don't know, maybe he didn't realize that she was using with Shane until it was too late. Yeah, maybe. You don't think maybe Phoenix did more than just scare her off, do ya? Nah. He's not a murderer. You sure about that? Don't get to the top without making big moves, right? You don't get to the top by killing all your customers either. Yeah, but he's just so protective of Shane. Could he have just snapped like he does, do you think? Yeah, or maybe she threatened to go to the cops. [softly] Fuck. [soft, tense music] Should we tell Shane? -Ah! -[gasps] Hey, you wanna come hang out with me this arvo? I'll show you around the neighborhood. Are you asking me out on a date? Nah. Yeah, nah. Just think of it as investigative journalism. Okay. I'm in.

I tried as well. I know. I saw you. I know. I saw you watching me. What are you doing there with that shovel? Making something. Making what? You ask a lot of questions, boy. Sorry. I thought that might happen. Come with me. In here, boy. [soft, tense music resumes] You coming? [shovel clanks] [Robert sighs] Do you make all these? [Robert] Bit of extra money on the side. I keep a few for myself. These are great. Do you play them? Not so much anymore. Hey! Here. Come on, boy. [birds twittering] You've never sanded anything before? Didn't your father teach you anything? Well, it's just been me and mom around the house for a long time. I'm not much of a handyman. Here. Like this. [Chris sighs] [sanding] That's okay? Good. Good.

[♪] [phone ringtone plays] [phone ringing] -Hello. -Hey. I wasn't sure if you were gonna screen my calls or not. I thought about it. But curiosity has always been my weakness. Look I just-- I wanted to let you know that I went and apologized to Bobby. How did it go? Okay. I think he accepted. I cleaned off the graffiti. It was--it was actually kind of fun. Well, it wasn't fun. It was--it was satisfying, I guess. What was he like? He's...interesting. He makes guitars out of random items like garden shovels and stuff. No dangerous vibes then? Ah, we'll see. I'm going back there tomorrow. [football bounces] Might do some more work. Just be careful. Yeah, of course. Maybe you found a character for your doco. Yeah? I tell you what. If he agrees to an interview, I might just come help you out. [Angus] Chris, hurry up! Okay. Thanks. [Angus] I need your help! [Chris] Look, I gotta go. I'll talk to you later. Okay. Bye, Chris. [Chris] What? [Angus] Gah! I'm getting slaughtered here. You're gonna have to help me out with this bullshit, dude. What do you want? That wasn't even allowed! Are you gonna do anything else today or...? [huffs] Screw it. [bright music from video game] [distorted rock music] How do you know he'll even let us in? [Phoenix] He thinks it's all good now. Ay, but how do you know for sure? Phoenix. How do you know for sure? Cause I said so. All right? [♪] Look, I squared things, and he doesn't know your coming. [overlapping shouting] [dog barking] [rock music continues] [shouting continues] [glass shatters] Where to next? [music ends] What are we doing here then? [door thuds] -Oh, come on. -Really? [sighs] He's not going in there, is he? -[soft, tense music] -[both breathing heavily] [girl moaning] Yeah! [paper rips] [exhales] If anything ever happens to me... make sure mum and Shane know about this, all right? Yeah, of course. [exhales through nose] Not that anything's gonna happen. I'm invincible, right? [breathes deeply] Come on. Let's get outta here. [male cop] This case is a bloody waste of time. [female cop] What if it was your daughter? You'd want answers. We have answers. She was a known user. Coroner reported signs of a struggle. Despite his record, this Bobby fella checks out. His record? Possession. Sexual assault. Spent conviction and acquitted. Right. [sawing] [birds chirping] [clears throat] [light acoustic music] What are you doing here, boy? Well, you said there's more work to do around here, right? Okay then. We're gonna take this down. Why? Don't like my work? I'm happy with what you did. That's the problem. I don't understand. Now the wall's a blank canvas. I don't want it to be used as a billboard for hate again. It won't now. I know it won't. You don't know that, boy. I'll talk to my mates. If it's not them, it'll be someone else. What about your security? [♪] The walls never gave me security. I've got nothing to hide. I'm not gonna close myself off to the world anymore. [♪] Wait here. [bird caws] What's the birds name? Oscar. Don't touch him. He bites. Hey, Oscar, hey. Good. [grunts] Here. It's great, but I don't even know how to play it. It's only three strings and they're tuned to a chord so you can't go wrong. I don't know what any of that means. There are no frets. Hm? All the notes work by sliding along the strings. Okay? [plays chord] So if you go like that... [vocalizing alongside instrument] Cool. [Oscar chirping] Try. One, two. Ready? [Robert vocalizing alongside instrument] [Chris chuckles] You're a natural. You make it seem so simple. If it feels right, it should be simple. I still haven't seen you play a song yet. What's wrong? Nothing. I just realized I haven't played to anyone for a long time. Hey, I'm a student filmmaker. I've actually got a documentary project at the moment. All right. And you can say no. I mean-- I--I would say no if I was you as well. I mean, considering everything that's happened, I would--I would probably say no as well. What are you talking about, boy? Can I interview you for my documentary? Why would anyone want to hear about me? I think it'd be a cool story. I think people would really like it. And I'll give you the final cut. What's final cut? [chuckles] It means you get to approve the edit before anyone else sees it. Better be good then, eh? Yeah, yeah. It's gonna be awesome. I can see a comeback tour in the making. Don't overdo it now, boy. Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Got some more demolition work on next week. Pays $25 an hour. Eh, demolition's the poor man's construction. Bunch of unskilled meatheads. Come do construction work with me. At least you'll actually learn a skill. Nah. Smashing shit up all day does me just fine. [Angus] Yeah? Cheap therapy for you then, I guess. [car approaching] [deep, tense music] What are you stooges up to? Fuck all. Just hanging out. Good to see you keeping out of trouble. Are you keeping out of trouble? What are you, my parole officer or something? I never said do as I do. Just do as I say. You're the one always saying actions speak louder than words. Don't be a hypocrite. Can you believe this little prick, huh? All right, Mum. Oi! I'll pick you up later. Yeah, okay, cool. [engine revving] [♪] Where are we going? [soft rap music from radio] [Angus] Hey, Sav. -How are you, dude? -Yeah, I'm all right. Hop in. Finish the round off okay? Yeah, no dramas. Don't worry about it. What? Don't worry about it. This one's on me. Really? What's the catch? No catch. You been buying off me for a while now. I know you're not a dog. Things are changing. Yeah? Keep an eye out for me, yeah? Yeah, sure. Keep Shane out of it, yeah? Yeah, of course. Get out. [soft, tense music] [engine turns over] I was talking to my mate Goran the other day. The concreter? Now he's got his own formwork business. It's good steady work. Anyway... I was talking to him, and he said he would be willing to take you on as an apprentice. Regular work. Get you all skilled up in the construction game. It's a good opportunity. What do you think? Yeah, I um... I appreciate the offer, bro. -But... -But what? [Shane] I mean... What can't I just come work with you? What? What do you mean, "What?" It's not a fucking thing, all right? Never will be. So much like Mum. Just don't know when to quit. Yeah, it's better than being like Dad. Fuck, you think concreting's grubby? You got no idea, bro. No idea. [suspenseful music] This fucking game. It's fucked, all right? You got a chance to do better. Is it better though? I mean, you've got everything you want. Do I? You know all of this could blow up at any time. -And it has before. -It has. And I got lucky, all right? Was able to build it back up. I don't know if I could do that again. You done? Yeah. Let's walk. [♪] The game's always changing, bro. Nobody stays up forever. What's wrong? I'm planning my exit. -What? -Getting out of this shit. Talking to Goran about starting a building company. Why would you want to do that? There's a lot of people out to get me, bro. So you're scared then? Yeah, maybe. [laughs] Nah, I don't believe that. What do you mean, you don't believe that? -I don't believe it. -You don't believe it. Don't believe it. What the fuck do you know? [Shane] Fuck off. Oi. I love you, all right? But you gotta trust me more. You gotta listen to me. All right? [Shane] Yeah. -All right? -All right. [♪] All right. Now show me this haymaker. [Phoenix grunts] [both grunting] [laughing softly] You good for money? Yeah. -[Phoenix] Here. -[Shane] Thank you. I've gotta go. What are you doing? Uh, gonna meet up with Angus. Stay off the streets, all right? Yeah. Cheers, bro. [music ends] [birds chirping] It might take him a while to warm up. Just saying. This looks pretty serious. It's actually pretty low-tech, Bobby. Just a two-person crew. This is my friend, Abbey. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Abbey. I'm excited to see these shovel guitars in action. Maybe I could show you how they get made. -Can I hold one? -Sure. It's cool. You can watch me string one up if you like? Well, I'd like to see you play one. Okay. All right.

[car beeps] [engine turns over] [music fading] [water splashes] So Angus tells me you got a nice MLC girl on the go. [Chris laughs] Nah, it's nothing like that. It's just a girl from TAFE. Anyway, that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. So what then? How come... you never told me about you and Tracy? 'Cause it hurts. Hearing her name hurts me. [soft, solemn music] I always used to say to her that I'll protect you. I'll keep you safe. I couldn't help but think... that while she was being murdered... She was waiting for me. She was waiting for me to show up. I'm sorry. I had no idea. How come you told Angus? Angus doesn't judge. Besides, you're always busy with your film and TAFE stuff anyway. [♪] I should have been a better mate. Yeah, well, doesn't matter anymore. Well, now I know why you're so angry and wanting someone to blame. No, not someone to blame. For the murderer to get caught. Well, you knew her. What were the other possible motives? What do you mean? Like, who was she buying from? Maybe something went wrong. Why? What do you know? I know that Phoenix found out about you two, and he wasn't very happy about it. Are you serious? Fuck you, man. You're just too emotionally involved. You can't see all the angles. He didn't fucking do it. How do you know? 'Cause I was with him the night of the murder. I remember he was lecturing me about being with her. "Never trust a junkie," he said. Maybe someone from his gang. You've changed. Coming in here with your lame-ass theories. Really think the cops haven't checked in to all that, huh? They've been burning to nail Phoenix for something and send him back to the clink. He didn't fucking do it. I just know. Everyone knows it was that dumb abo, Black Bobby, anyway. Cops haven't charged him! All right? It doesn't make any sense. Why are you defending him? He returned my wallet. So what? He probably just did that cause he knows the cops are watching him close. I went and apologized to him too. [Shane] You fucking what? Yeah, that's right. He's a hate crime victim, okay? I cleaned up the vandalism we did too. I can tell you that he didn't do it. Why the fuck would you do that? What makes you so sure, huh? What makes you so cocky and sure? I don't know. Same as you, okay? The guy makes guitars out of shovels and stuff. He's not what you think. Guitars out of shovels. Yeah. Nah, Chris. There's a way bigger difference here. I've known Phoenix my entire life. How can you really know someone in just a couple of days? I don't know, all right? Just--he's not what people think. You're a fool. You know that? You've never been street smart. I'm smart enough to know the truth. You think you know the truth. Are you stupid or something? It's all--it's all fake pedophile grooming tactics. That's bullshit. Mate, he's been seen in the past walking school kids home. That's fucking bullshit. -He's been seen! -Fuck off! I'm not a spreader of hate, okay? I know he did it. Yeah, so you've seen a good side to him. Everyone has a good side to them. Everyone. It doesn't erase their past mistakes. You're naïve, man. And I'm worried about ya. I'm fine. [tense music] Yeah, walk away, Chris. Like you always fucking do. [♪] [singer vocalizing] [Angus] I don't know about this, Shane. Don't pussy out on me now. The fence is down. Do you really think we should do this? Man up. [suspenseful music] This is nothing in comparison. What? You're an idiot. [birds chirping] [♪] [Oscar screeches] [♪] [glass shatters] [Angus] What are you doing? Hurry up! Shane! Wait here. [Angus] Where are you going? Shane! [Oscar chirping] [Angus] What--what-- what are you doing? [Oscar screeching] [tense music] What are you doing? Shane. What are you doing? Fucking hell, Shane. [♪] [Angus] Nah, I'm out of here. [grave music] [Bobby panting] [extinguisher hissing] [♪] [Bobby coughs, wheezes] [solemn piano music] [Bobby clears throat] [mutters indistinctly] [breathing heavily] [dramatic music building] [♪] [coughs] [engine revving] [♪] [music stops] [dramatic music resumes] [eerie piano music] [engine revving] [♪] [music fades] [both panting] [♪] [tires screeching] [tires screech] Shit. Fuck. [grunts] Let's split up. [♪] [Angus breathing heavily] [grunting] [echoing] Come here! [♪] [grunts] [leaves rustling] [echoing] Shane! [music fading to tense music] [panting] [echoing] Shane! [echoing] Shane! [mumbles] Fuck. [exclaims] Fuck. [eerie music] Shane. Can you hear me? [grunting] Oh, fuck. Okay. [♪] Hello? We need an ambulance right now. We're in--we're in John Forest National Park. Oh, Shane. I don't know. Yeah, it's--yes, he's still breathing. Oh. Oh. [♪] [thunder rumbling] [solemn piano music] [train rumbling, bell ringing] I always told him he was gonna hurt himself real bad one day. I remember... when I was 18... my step-dad used to beat mum... real bad. [Sav] I remember. One day, I decided to jump in. Be a hero. I was getting the shit beaten out of me. Then this little guy-- he was about five-- [♪] Jumps in. Course he got thrown from one end of the room to the other. Always a bold one. Always. If the little prick doesn't make it... who have I got? [snifflles] Who have I got? [sniffs] [Sav] You got me, mate. [Angus] We set Black Bobby's shed on fire. He caught us. Then he chased us into the park, and he just kept coming for us, he wouldn't stop. So you're telling me you saw this Bobby attack Shane? Well, no. We... We split up--we-- we, um, but we-- Calm down. Take a breath. So Bobby was chasing you, right? Then next thing you know, Shane's in the gully unconscious. Is that correct? Yeah. But I didn't see it happen. Well? [Sav] It was that blackfella. Bobby. He attacked them both. [♪] [huffs] [growls] [growls] Relax. We'll get the scum, all right? [Phoenix grunts] Stay here. [♪] [phone ringing] Angus. I'm on my way. Are you still at the hospital? Yeah, yeah, I am. Listen, something else has happened. [Chris] What is it? Phoenix. [dramatic music] Give me the keys. -Nah, you're not driving. -Give me the fucking keys! Nah, mate. You're too pissed off to drive. [dramatic rock music] [engine revving] You should slow down. Mate, seriously, slow down. You need to send cops to Salisbury Road Swan View now. I don't know what number it's--um, it's the rear house off the end of the reserve crossing. Please, you need to go now! [dog barking] [engine revving] [♪] [metal music from car radio] [brakes screech] [thud] [♪] [Phoenix] Keep it running. [man] Call the ambulance. Oi, kid. Oi, kid. Are you all right? [grave music] Stay down, mate. Stay down. Mate, stay down. Oi, kid! [ominous music] [birds chirping] [dramatic music building] [nurse] He's a very lucky boy. His friend here might have just have saved his life. [machines whirring] I'm sorry. It's all my fault. Never should have gone there. None of this would have happened. What happened in John Forest? I tripped over the cliff. Bloody idiot. You what? I tripped. [woman] What is it, Angus? [machine clicks] [ominous music] I know you. [echoing] And I fucking know you! [birds twittering] You hurt my brother! Calm down. Shut up. -Those boys broke into my shed. -[Phoenix] Shut up. They trashed all my stuff. They killed my bird! [echoing] I said shut the fuck up! They've been harassing me for weeks. Is that why you threw my brother off a cliff, huh? You fucking dog. That's not what happened. You fucking kill that girl as well? No! I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that. Don't you lie to me. Don't you fucking lie to me now. [echoing] Don't you fucking lie to me! My brothers friend was there as well, all right? -He fucking saw it all. -[yelps] [phone ringing] [dramatic music growing] [both grunting] [Bobby groaning] [♪] [choking] [Chris panting] [Bobby choking] [♪] [music ends] -[body squelches] -[Bobby gasps, groans] [body squelches] [groans] [panting] [ethereal music] [Phoenix panting] [music stops] Bobby. Oh. Bobby. Bobby. [indistinct] [echoing] Help! [solemn piano music] [echoing] Someone help! [whispers] Come on, Bobby. S... [♪] [mumbles] Come on, Bobby. Mm. [echoing] Help! [distant, echoing] Someone help! Bobby. [muted sobbing] [♪] [♪] [distant sirens wailing] [♪] [Bobby on video] Grew up in a country town. I'm not sure we should show this anymore. [coffee machine whirs] [whirring continues] [Sav] Want a coffee? No, thanks. Why did you call me here? You've handled yourself pretty well in all this. Just... did what I had to. Yeah. You did. It's 'cause you're a survivor, Angus. Nobody ever saw it in you... but I did. Was it you? Was what me? Did you do it? Nah, mate. [distant, indistinct chatter] Phoenix is responsible for his own actions. And I gotta pick up the bloody pieces again. That's not what I was asking. Just tell me. [Sav] There is nothing to tell. It's all in the past. We're all about the future here. Now I got a job coming up next month. With Phoenix gone... I could use an extra pair of hands. [tense music] What do you say? You in? Yeah. Yeah, I'm up for it. Good. Good. [♪] [distorted overlapping voices] [♪] [construction worker shouting] [♪] [Bobby] I'm Robert Bouratch. My friends call me Bobby. Grew up in a country town. I've been making shovel guitars for about 15 years. I've played in many bands growing up. First one was Black Roses. Had that band together for about three years. [Chris] Tell us about your song. It's a song I wrote years ago. Hope you like it.
