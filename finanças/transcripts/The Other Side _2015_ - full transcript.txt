But, anyway, the man came. I begged him. I said, "Please don't turn the lights off. Please." I said, "Can you at least give us till in the morning or this evening?" "No, ma'am. It's past time, so we have to turn it off right now." So that's what he did.

I know Ray has seen combat. And I can tell you that I'm one of the few people that has seen desert and jungle combat. Okay? Ray is not a joke.

It's the man that's in the mud, that's in the blood sitting right next to you and suffering with you. That's who you fight for. That's who you keep pushing for. That's what I mean by everybody from this point on. Y'all ask me what your duties are and what do I want from you. I want you to bring someone out. That is how we grow our ranks. That is how we make our group bigger and trustworthy. I'd like to know the people that I associate would-- that's gonna cover my back. You can come over, hang out and eat hot dogs and hamburgers if you want to on the holidays. That's great. We know each other. If I'm associated with 3,000 people, we don't know diddly-squat about fucking anybody when the shit hits the fan. None of us know each other. I don't care to trust people I don't know. If you've never been in the military and you're a part of this organization, you willknow what camaraderie is. You know, it's-- It's more than just being out there shooting weapons together. It's more than being out there and training with each other, drinking beer, eating pig. It's about being able to call your brother up in the middle of the night because you have a problem or because you can't sleep, and your brother's there for you. It's about having a brother that'll drive a hundred miles to come and save your ass, if that's what it takes. Guys, we are here for one reason and one reason alone.

Sir, are you ready to get signed up? That's what I call Obamacare.MAN #1: I think everybody needs Obamacare. I cannot breathe. I am so done. Can I have a beer now? I feel pretty good right now.Yeah! Serious?Yeah, I'm serious. I came to get your fucking ass out. Make sure you hook the frame.Yeah. No shit. [indistinct]Not a bumper. We about to fuckin' test pull with my fucking welds. - [shrieks] - [engine revving] Your cigarettes at the top. MAN: Our arsenal next year's gonna be nice. MAN #2: We put 'em all together, it'll be real nice. Saturday. Saturday it'll be ugly. Saturday it's gonna get real ugly. I'm gonna bring the .45-70 out. You're gonna bring the Joker?Yeah, I might as well. Oh, yeah, he's got it. Go ahead. I got another-- I got another mag in that for that gun. It's-- The camo is that? MAN #1: It's by the couch.Yeah. MAN #2: You said you wanted to shoot a big gun. We'll give you a couple of 'em. Dude. MAN #3: You're on your own. I love this gun! Whoo! That's a fucking gun. He's hitting whatever.[laughing] If he was out there, he'd have a problem. Stand up in there. You want something else?Yeah. How much more ammo you got up there? Give it to him. Is that all five? No. I don't think it was actually. Nah, there's two more, I do believe. Or one more. Nah, there's no more. There it is.That's it. [clicks]Okay. Hey. John Wayne didn't do that. [laughs] 'Cause it was too big for him. Ain't no shit. That's what she said. [men laugh][gunshot] Yeah! We'll keep our land. We'll farm. We'll raise cattle. We'll go back to that-- You know, the way lifestyle was meant to be. I work for my living. I work for my keep, and I work to survive. And that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna organize. And we're gonna just-- I just don't wanna work to support somebody else. We gotta do everything we can to protect our families, and that's what we do. I have the right to bear arms. I should be able to bear arms everywhere. They're already confiscating guns in Massachusetts-- Indiana.And Indiana. Indiana used to have some of the loosest gun laws. There's no fucking reason why they could or should confiscate anything. It's my fucking constitutional rights. Honestly, if you look at what's happening to our country right now, it's the same thing that we do to other countries. Yes, yes.And you should know this. What we do-- and I'm sorry to say this. Sometimes I'm not proud of this. But we go to other countries. We tell them how to live their lives. We put in a person that we think should be in charge--Yes. and then support them. Sometimes the rebels--We teach them our ways. Yeah. Our ways. Now, this is the question. How long has the US been around? Anybody.Two hundred and-- Two hundred-plus years.Yeah. Oh, yeah. How long, uh, the Middle East been around? And I know I'm generalizing there, but-- Been around 10,000, 15,000 years?Right. Who are we to tell them how to live their lives?Exactly. And I'm sorry to say that, but it's the truth. Who are we-- And I understand that people need help. But who are we to go over there and try to tell them how to live their lives? [gunshots in distance]Unless you're going to stay there and make that happen, which, I think, is fucked up to began with 'cause you're telling them you're gonna live by my set of rules, but-- Except us. And that's what's happening to us right now. They're setting up FEMA camps. They're, uh-- They're taking over schools. They're taking over the EPA. They're taking over the car industry. You know, we've had our governor call and ask us if we'll go fight on the border, you know, with pay, of course. It'll be-- It's contract work and whatnot. We'll go out there and we'll help defend our borders and whatnot. I understand that. That's a government organization. That's why every single one of us pay taxes for military and border patrol to do that. That's their job. We're not gonna go do it, because our organization is family. [grunting][barking] [screeching] [screeching stops] I shoved my boot in his mouth just now. Why are you running, Cody? You're gonna get me with that. It stuck to him. Hey, you got one on yourself. Put that nut on him.You're gonna give him the nut? Hey, hey, you want a nut?I'll give it to him. Let me see that. Hey, don't fuck with him. Don't fuck with him. Open your hand. I'll just put it in there. Just one time. Aw.Okay, here. You're so nasty. You take anything. Bitch is disgusting.Disgusting. You're the one holding it.You held the nut? Oh, my gosh. Nice. First man is gonna start from your left. Have in mind I'm looking at y'all, so on your left. Okay? Start. Move to the barricade. Second man's all the way on the right. Move to the far barricade. Squad leader's in the middle. He's gonna be the last one to move. He moves right here. From there, same sequence. Left, right, center. Move to the center barricade and cover. Communicate. Use your hand signals. No words. [gunshots] There is going to be another revolution in this country. They can only step on our Constitution so much. I'm not saying that I wanna be on the front line and getting into this. But it's coming, guys. I mean, it's gonna happen eventually. And they're just putting more and more things into play so that it's right there in front of us. And we-- we're not noticing. No bullshit. Within the next couple of months, The UN will be here. And that is all over Fox News. That's all over MSNBC. And we know they're owned by fucking Obama and them. They arecoming. They've declared that the whole refugee thing and la-la-la, and they're gonna come down here and take care of 'em and figure out what's best for 'em. So that is the UN's door. So if you think that martial law is not coming eventually, wake up, 'cause it will be coming.And that's the key word. You know, the key thing right there-- The second that they put martial law into effect is when the shit's hitting the fan. It's gone too far. That's when they're gonna start kicking doors. That's when they're gonna do whatever they wanna do, 'cause you're just a pawn on a big old chessboard. Shutting down freeways.And the shutdown freeways, checkpoints, everything else. So that's gonna be what's gonna spark our rendezvous. When I tell you grab your wife and kids, whatever you're gonna need, most likely you will not go back to your house, because if you do go back to your house, everything will be gone. Yeah.Everything. And I mean that. There's gonna be too many roadblocks and everything else to even get there. Highways will be shut down. That's what I mean by their taking away more and more freedoms and trying to find stiffer punishment for shit that doesn't make no sense. But yet you can murder somebody and get out in six years. You know, but go deal some drugs, your ass will be there for fucking 20.Yep. And that's what I mean by-- Dudes, it's just-- You need to be prepared, guys. And we're not out here just playing Boy Scouts, playing in the army. We're out here preparing for the worst scenario. And that's something I need everybody to be clear on. Every drill you need to take seriously. I mean, 'cause--How you practice is how you'll perform. Exactly.But this is just something we got to think about, guys. I do appreciate all y'all coming out today. I know we've been out here for a while, and there's a lot of running around. Next time it'll be something new, something else we'll be doing. Uh, we'll be doing it-- Actually, every two weeks is what we're gonna be needing from here on out. [airplane engine whirring] He's gonna have to skim the ground. Down there. That way. Just land the motherfucker. [whirring continues] Look like he's doing like 20 or 30 mile an hour. That's duct tape. And that looks badass right there. Yeah, like right now he's heading straight in that wind. Whenever we got to fly, dude, it was fucking insane how much that wind fucking played on it. Just gonna fly in it. That's it. Hey, did you give him a beer? Did you give him a beer? Let it go! [chattering] [laughing] Oh, yeah, we got this. Notice the letters getting smaller? You should've put "blows." "Obama sucks." [chattering] Did you bring your .243?I can go get it. I have a scope on this. We'll just set up one big one. One big one. We can't set up three of 'em if we ain't got three good guns. Let's go ahead and step back, and we'll just go ahead and blow a shitload of holes in it, and then we'll blow it the fuck up. [belches] Aw, man. Oh, you gonna go ahead and blow one of them up? Who's all ready?Who's ready? Oh, let's go. [belches] Say when!Show him what we think about it. Light that motherfucker up! I'll get some more. It almost went in the trunk. Hey, let me see it. [laughs] Fuel the fire. There you go. He's all like, "screw you." Reminds me of that game Twisted Metal rather than Grand Theft Auto. Whoo! Fucking America!
