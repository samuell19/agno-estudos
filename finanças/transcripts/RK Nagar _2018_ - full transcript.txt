Akash! Hey, Akash! What are you doing? Is that your phone? -Give it to me. -No, ma'am. -Didn't you hear me? -Don't, ma'am. You must behave! I have told you not to use your phone in class, haven't I? You're such an idiot! How dare you look at me like that? Get out! Stop glaring at me! Get out! Such a stubborn boy! Thick-skinned fellow! Maybe he just enjoys torturing me. I don't know what's wrong with him! He ruined my day! He's going to become a ragpicker for sure! Does he even come here to study? He will never prosper in life. Jerk! Baby, wait here. I'll be back in five minutes. Okay, Ma. Ma? Ma, what's taking you so long? I am hungry. Open the door. Ma! I am hungry, Ma. Ma, open the door! Ma, what are you doing? I want to eat! Open the door! Ma!

Yeah, I am doing it. Come on, throw it! Hey, catch it! You're out! That was such a lousy shot. Go, man. -Babu, it's your turn to bat. -Okay, bro. -Hey! Why did you eat my lunch? -I didn't! I didn't touch your lunch! Who is he? The chairman's son is hitting our friend. Why is he hitting him? It hurts! Why are you both fighting? He ate my lunch, bro. -Why did you? -He's lying, bro. I'm lying? Don't act smart. Let me handle this. Did he eat your lunch? Hey, mind your tongue! Show some respect. Why should I? You just bully kids for freebies. -I'll smash your face. -I dare you. You want to try your luck or should I tell my uncle about this? Tell me. Should I tell Uncle Mannu about this? -Govind! -Coming, bro! -I'll deal with you later. -Yeah, right! You're such a show off! Don't insult my uncle. I won't spare you! If I tell Lottai about this he'll kill your uncle. -Don't you dare drag my uncle in this. -Take your hands off me! -Send it to that director, Mr. Rajamouli. -Okay. Good afternoon. The kids play here with their shoes on. You know it isn't allowed near the temple. And at night, the drunkards... My uncle has offered to build the wall, right? Then why are you bothering him? -Get lost! -Sir, please do the needful. One ground or so. Shall I check it out? Are you sure? TAMIL NADU PEOPLE'S PARTY INDEPENDANT CANDIDATE You eat with the same hand you use to wipe your ass. What will you do with your right hand? Do you know why the elections are being held on 21st December? You seem to be stingy with your words. I'm respected a lot in this area, sir. If I urge them to vote for you, they will. But then it won't make me any different from a politician like you. I am sorry, sir. Hey, Visu! Come here. Hello, Uncle! I have told you not to call me that! You're my friend. I'm bound to make fun of you, Uncle. -Stop calling me uncle. -Do you want some tea? No, thank you. I need to discuss something important. I hope it isn't about a woman. One should not discuss women while working. It's too funny! Is it? Wait! I was just kidding! It is a serious issue. The chairman is asking me to put you behind bars. Oh, come on. Will you? All the stuff has been confiscated and Shankar is under police custody. If he says anything, you'll be behind bars. There's nothing to worry about. VOTE FOR T.K. BALA Where are you going? You come here only when you need votes. But what about our problems? The roads are bad, there is no water and the garbage in the dumping grounds is burned every day. If a shop catches fire in T Nagar a fire engine is sent at once, right? -Sign a petition and we'll take a look. -Impossible. Lottai, why are you arguing with a man from our caste? You drag caste into this and I'll murder you. Do you think they'll vote for you because you're an actor? Do you think you're MGR? First solve our problems and then ask for votes. -Hey, Mannu! -Lottai! Don't forget, I'll be the one to kill you! I will mince you! -Sendhil. -What? Where is Shankar? -What happened? -There's a major scuffle in school. I want Shankar to mediate. Do you have money to pay? I have money, bro. Just get Shankar here. Well, if you have money he'll be there. -Where is Shankar? -I don't know, bro. Why isn't he answering my calls? Why does he even own a phone? Get me some tea. -Are you a personal loan agent? -No, bike loan. Have you been waiting here since morning? -Did he ask you to come? -Yes. I bet he will not show up. I'll get going. You look starved as well. Drink my tea while you wait for him. Hey! You lowlife! Where is Shankar? Don't you feel ashamed? First you borrow money and then you don't repay. There's no point in yelling at you. I should just take some from your collection. Has he borrowed from everybody? He has so many business cards! Shankar will face the consequences when Lottai arrives. Then he will know. -What are you looking at? -Sir, he took this bike on loan. Did he take it from you? Well, he mortgaged this bike for a loan. Sir, he has not paid his dues in the last six months. He hasn't paid the interest as well. I'll take a legal action against him, sir. Legal action? I'll take illegal actions against you! Back off! Hey! I'll be back in the evening. Don't let Shankar go. Keep the cash ready. Bro, what time is Mr. Shankar expected? "Mr. Shankar"? Hey! What? What the hell? We are going through water scarcity. So, why to waste water by throwing it on my face? -The inspector wants to see you. -I'm coming. Sit down, bro. Idiot! You have got a paunch even after dieting. I'll make sure that this is not repeated in future, sir. Ma, why did you come here? I would have come home by evening. He is on a picnic. He will go back home in the evening. Sir, he talks nonsense. How can you say so? I have stitched so many clothes for you. -Keep quiet. -Did I ever ask you to pay? You are reprimanding a police officer! Are you a rowdy? I am not a rowdy, sir. I am well educated. Sir, does he look like one to you? Fine, I look like a nitwit. You got this job with your degree, right? -Can you answer this? -What? How did your mother die? Ma... Look at him! He doesn't even know how his mother died! This is the difference between a literate and an illiterate person. If you are so intelligent, why do you resort to riots? What else can we do when the politicians are uneducated? Riot is the only answer. You should be arrested for your behavior. Go home, ma'am. He will stay here for a while. Will you shut up? I am not capable enough to carry out a protest march, sir. I went there because Lottai called me. Every hour they distributed biryani to everyone. Many artistes turned up. Even Nayanthara was present, sir. Why are you talking about it? Even though his neck was injured, he still supported the cause. I shall break your neck as well. Why are you talking irrelevantly? You should be arrested for keeping weapons illegally. Lottai kept the weapons, sir. Lottai kept them? Have you lost your mind? How can you say so? Only Lottai shows up to solve issues in our area. You just fill your pockets... I mean, you line up for your rounds regularly-- Ask him to leave or else I'll put him behind bars for eight years. Please wait outside. I'll come in a while. -See you, sir. -Wait outside. -Sir, did you file any report? -I didn't. As if I'm dying to drag the boys behind bars. I agree that they fight for a good cause. You said he is well educated. Why is he hell-bent on being a tailor? He can choose a better career. What did he study? He studied only up to seventh grade. You locked up a bright student. I wonder what riots will crop up to. Hip-Hop Adhi will be arriving here with his gang. I'm not responsible if he puts any auto on fire. Take him along. Ask him not to mention Lottai unnecessarily. Hey! Why do you always get into trouble? Listen to me-- Do you want me to shut my shop because I can't pay the rent? -You don't know anything. -No. Listen to me. Do you think your son will get a job as a Collector? I know to stitch and I kind of get by. Pothys put up a grand sale of two blouses for only 150 rupees. I don't get any orders. Don't instigate me. When you will get married-- Then both of us will become tailors and handle everything. -Rickshaw! -Try to understand me. R.K Nagar, Tondiarpet. Okay, sir. -Do you have the money to pay? -Yes. Let me see. Go home and pay him. I'll take this. -Get going. -Aren't you coming? What is today's mediation? The school boys asked for you. I'll beat you black and blue. Do you think you're a rowdy? -Don, huh? -It hurts! -Creating a ruckus in my area, huh? -Don't hit me, bro. -Where are you from? -Nehru Nagar, bro. I have never seen you in Nehru Nagar. -You are hurting me, bro. -Yes. At the chairman's house. Where? I am the chairman's son, bro. Chairman's son? What is he saying? He's the chairman's son. Mannu is his uncle. Do you think I'll be scared of Mannu? Do you know who am I? -No, bro. -Lottai and I are friends. You won't tell anyone, right? -I won't, bro. -Good boy! -Give me the cash. -Come on. Here, take it. Keep this as a secret. Get some... Get yourself some candies on the way. -Okay? -Yes, bro. Let's go. It looks like I won't get the cash today. He's late. How long do you expect me to wait? The roads were full of pot holes. By the time I could maneuver-- Save this lame excuse for some imbecile. I swear I am speaking the truth. This is a very small arbitration. If they disagree, we can't earn anything. Speak up now. Get lost, you jerk! -Whom did you call a jerk? -You, of course. You got drunk and puked in my parking lot. Shut up. -You parked in my spot. -Where else should I? -What are they fighting for? -The parking lot. Why do you bring such petty issues to me? This is what you will get in 500 rupees. Fights over clothesline, spitting on the road. There's a project to hack somebody's hand. You'll be paid one hundred thousand for it. -This will do. -Do it then. What do you want me to do now? -Don't get aggressive. -Don't act over smart. Shall I call Lottai? They don't have anything to say now. Your problem is resolved because I came. Lottai would have made you run for your life. What's the issue? I parked my bike in his spot and now he's calling me names! Why are you getting hyper? If he parks his bike in your spot, you park yours in his. His bike is in his spot. He owns two bikes. Do you have two of them? You're loaded then. Did you demand a reasonable fee? We came to support the other man, not him. -Support him? -Yes. It looks like he'll be tipsy in one beer. If you park your bikes in both the spots, where will he park his bike? Bro, where's your bike? -I don't have one. -What? I haven't bought one yet! So what? You will buy it in a few days, right? It will take around six-seven months. How can we solve this arbitration if you will take so long to buy a bike? Buy it sooner. I'll move my bike when he buys one. Till then let me use that spot. You can't park your bike there just because it's vacant. Tomorrow when he goes to work, will you move into his house? If she invites my husband, I'll beat the shit out of her. You think I am interested in your husband? My husband cares for me, unlike yours. Are you trying to insult my husband? Why would he need two bikes if he has one wife? If he owns two bikes then... How dare you point at his character! Don't fight! Don't fight, ma'am. If you try manhandling me then my friend... Hey, Shankar! You were supposed to mediate parking, not make the women fight. Shankar, don't run away! Wait a minute! Don't leave me behind! Hey, Uncle. Hello. Why are you here? I am here to take my order. -I can't let you in. -Me? -It is Ms. Ranjani's order. -Why? Wait. Kamatchi. Inform Ms. Ranjani that Vicky has come. -Go. -Okay. Why are you involving them? You were dealing with this. Do whatever you can. Ranjani. Mr. Velu is asking for you. We have a deal between us. -Do the needful. -Don't talk about it. She's here. Please come, ma'am. Ma'am? She looks so young! What did you say? He meant I called you ma'am -but you look so young-- -What? Sorry, ma'am. Forgive him. Why are you apologizing for him? If it was an exceptional case, I would have understood. He doesn't deliver on time. He's never punctual. He wasn't well. He had a stomach ache. -Explain it to her. -All of that is an excuse. Yes, Ranjani. -Ma'am! -Ma'am. He is never on time. The customers keep complaining. Ranjani, cancel his order. Oh, my! Why to cancel his order? He's the only son of his family. He is the only earning member in the family. He'll be punctual from now. -How long will I speak for you? -Yes, ma'am. I shouldn't get any complaints. Otherwise, I'll cancel the order. I guarantee that he will work properly. Please carry on. We won't butt in. Keep it inside! -Load the materials. -Yes. If you keep staring at her, you'll lose the order. Is she the chairman's daughter? I've never seen her before. She was studying in a college and she used to commute only by her car. Please move to the front. Passengers in front please buy your tickets. Bro, don't stand on the footboard. Climb up. -Hi. -Hello. Here's the phone. -Check out the video. -Video? Hello. Here, take it. -How long will it take? -One hour, bro. Let me copy it first. We can upload it later. Give me your ID. Here. Girls get impressed with your height. Is the next video ready? Even if you check it again, it's the same account. It's all intact. Forget it. The guest in room number 101 wanted the Wi-Fi password. -Is that so? Wait. -Yes. Here's the Wi-Fi password. You all could pay just ten rupees each, huh? Who else is after me in this area? Only you. Bro, come for the game. It's getting late. Those guys? Hey, wait. You're the king. Do you know why I kept those knives in your shop? Because only then you'll be a rowdy. -I don't want it. -Give it to me. -I'll drink it instead. -Hey! Give it to me. Listen to me. If you want people to respect and fear you, you need to have machetes and money. Only then we will be revered. Bro, are you coming or shall we start? Can't you see I'm busy? -Idiot! -Great! Escape. Hey, Shankar. I'll make you a notorious rowdy in this area. -Okay. -Trust me! You're putting him on a pedestal. He's a pip-squeak. Go get some powder for the board. How come he has a dress in his store? Bro, there is a dress in here. Hey, that's my customer's dress. Customer's dress, huh? -Give it to me. -Bro, see this. Bro, that's my customer's dress. How could you do this? Who is this customer asking you to stitch with pieces of cloths? It's not a customer's dress. He stitched it for his future wife. Do you know how often he has faced rejection because of this dress? He's looking for a princess who will fit in this dress. Hello, Visu. -What, bro? -Tell me. I heard that you and Mannu are hiding from each other. Are you taking an extra dig at me? I heard people gossiping about it. That's why I asked you. You lend money. Did I step into your space? Speaking about interest, I just remembered that Shankar had borrowed money from me three months ago and has not paid the interest yet. Help me out. Look how he's changing the topic. No one will lend money after six in the evening. Go! Don't use superstitions as an excuse. Then Shankar will light it up. Get lost. We'll collect money in the morning. -My turn? -Bro. He won't be in the shop then. He comes only after you get here. Hey, just go. -Useless! Go now. -Bro, it's your turn. This is a temple issue. Don't postpone it, okay? -Hello, sir. -You got it wrong. He's the chairman, not me. -Good evening, sir. -Why did I ask you to come? -What's his name? -Lottai, Uncle. Yes, Lottai. Why don't you arrest him? He's into rioting and picketing. Sir, I'm sure you are aware. There's no point in arresting him now. It will be problematic. Shankar accepted that Lottai had kept the weapons in his shop. Can't you do anything about it? I interrogated him. He claimed that he doesn't know anything about it. That isn't the point, Uncle. The inspector is Lottai's friend. They were classmates. -Is it? -Yes, sir. -Do you live around here? -No, sir. Tondiarpet. But I studied here. Tondiarpet is just in our neighborhood. My daughter has come. You can leave now. Okay, bro. Let's go. Bro, he always competes with me. Bharani, go to the temple in the morning-- Why are you blocking my way? Move aside. Idiot! Who let him in? Him? He's a decent guy. After he befriended Gayathri he has turned into a rowdy. Are you talking about the show? It's useless to tell you anything! You and Lottai are classmates. You studied together. You're an inspector and he is a rowdy. Handle this well. Don't blame it on me later on. I'll take care of it, sir. One minute, sir. In the sequel of Chennai 28... -Did you watch it? -Yes, sir. Gangai Amaran is a good friend of mine. I used to attend his concerts regularly. He asked me if I wanted to work for him, so I did. Was it good? It was very good, sir. Please don't forget what I said. I'll deal with it, sir. Dad has no sense at all. He just doesn't listen. I'm so mad at him. Let him come home. -Hey! Let me watch the show. -Keep quiet, Ma. Hey, Mannu. Don't sit here with your dirty feet. Go freshen up. It's all because of the people you are surrounded with. You hang around with rowdies. What else to expect from you? Go wash your feet. Calm down. If you lose your temper, the inspector will put you behind bars. Why is it so loud? I didn't do it. Your daughter did it. Will you have something to eat? -No, I'll go home. -Be safe. Hold on! Did you change your religion, dear? Did you eat anything? I don't want to eat. Why, dear? Why are you bringing thugs in here? Don't call the inspector a rowdy! He came to see me because I am the chairman. She is talking about your nephew not the inspector. You know it all! Ranjani, what's bothering you? You don't want thugs coming over, right? I'll make sure of that. Okay? Also, stop your pretends of being drunk. I swear I will not do that henceforth. Go on, have your food. Come quietly. We don't want to wake anyone up. -No! -What? Don't do that! You stupid fellow! Go inside. Hey, Shankar! Why are you entering your own house like a thief? I didn't want my mother to wake up. Your mother paid the rent. 2,000 for one vote as a bribe. You can chill. Nothing like that, bro. I was just going quietly. Thank your gift of the gab. Otherwise, you would have been a dog's dinner! -Oh, Lord! -Oh, my! You call him your son? -Come at midnight and scare everyone. -Ma, open the door. Open the door, Ma. I'm hungry. Wait, I'm changing my sari! Thanks to your ruckus, I forgot to tell you something important. Okay, okay. Chill, Ma! Ms. Ranjani and the clothes supplier had some issues. Okay. Maybe you should meet the manager and ask for the tender. I'm hungry, Ma. Please open the door. That manager is grouchy. Handle him nicely. Come in, both of you. Come in, bro. -Bro. -Yes. Can we leave early in the morning? -Where? -What? Mother asked you to go to the export company, right? -Yeah, we'll go. -Why are you nodding your head? We can get a bulk order. If we get it, life will be easier. You see how your classmates have got along. They have the latest phones and bikes. And you roam around with me. Hey! What can I do? Their fathers educated them. They made it big. My father took me to a tailor's shop and made me a tailor. And then he died at a young age. Your father owned a shop? How else do you think I learnt tailoring? My mother used to force me to go to school. My father would call me to his tailoring shop. He made me follow him. Do you know how well I studied? I have always topped the class. I wanted to excel academically, earn good and become a reputed officer. And look after my mother. The last time I cried was when my father died. After that I could never cry. My mother looked after me so well. Once I am asleep, she would sit next to me and keep crying. What could I do? She would feel bad if she knew I was awake. So, I would pretend to be sleeping. Poor soul! Why are you staring at me? How can you lie so easily? What do you mean? Your father was a driver in a travel agency. I believe he died in an accident. -Who told you? -Your mother did. She cries the whole night and tells you all of this in the morning! She made you learn tailoring only because you didn't study well. When did she say this? She told me when I started working at the shop. I was just blabbering about my father. But I'll tell you about my mother-- Bro, come on! Don't lie anymore. Hey! Leave now. You'll be late for our appointment. Come early in the morning. Talking nonsense! My mother needs a doctor. -Why are you digging here? -To build up a wall. The wall is supposed to be built there. The chairman asked us to build a compound wall. That's too much of cement. Mix some sand, Mani. Cinema and politics will ruin this land. You gave him the chairman post because he's an actor. Now he has nailed all of you. Not everyone can become MGR. Only our leader can conquer hearts even from the grave. Why to seize the temple land? Be thankful that he didn't take the temple down. Will God keep quiet if His land is trespassed? What can God do? Will He poke your eyes at night? God, it seems! How can a man who punishes be God? Only the one who forgives is God. You are to be blamed. Do you get it? You showed him an empty land. He put up a fence. What do we do now? Let's wait and see if he plots the rest of the land or builds a tower. If he builds a tower, we'll buy a flat on discount. How's my idea? What is this, sir? If you want to stop all of this, get signatures from the residents. File a case, get adjournment and extend till election. Anyway, we'll win this election. -I'll build the temple wall. -Sounds good, sir. -Who will get the signatures? -I'll get them, sir. But you're at loggerheads with them. I can easily handle it. Take care. I'll talk to the lawyer. -I'll take your leave. -Okay, sir. Oh, my! Bro, what a huge company! If we get this order, we can make it big. It will be easy. Bro, it's all in your hands. Don't talk rubbish. Come on, I'll handle everything. What is it? -I am here to meet the manager. -What's your name? My name is Shankar. -Please wait. -Okay. She didn't even ask why we are here. How will my name be enough? Your mother must have told her. Stitch it properly. Place it right. Mr. Velu, someone has come to see you. Okay, I'll be there. Hey, do it. Take it along and follow me. I have to handle everything. I am the manager. Bring all the clothes here. -Bro, he's telling us. -Don't be silly. Why are you just standing there? -I am getting late. Bring it fast. -Yes, sir. Bro, we're so lucky! We got the job. Your mother must have told him. All that is fine. This seems to be a new stock. Why is he asking us to dump it? Maybe he will count and then give it to us. What are they doing inside? They are just wasting my time! What are you doing? Why did you throw that stock over there? You told us to dump it here. I did? -Who are you? -Shankar. I came to get this order. I'm the tailor. Sir, it was a mistake. There's no vacancy here. We're full. You have come to the wrong place. Leave! I'll give you your share. Just do it. How dare you! I'm not that kind of a person. Find someone else. I didn't mean it. I'm from this area. Please do the needful. Why do you have to talk about the area? Do you think you can intimidate me? Do you think only you can hold a machete? Do you know I'm well versed in it? Do you know that I'm a rowdy in Madurai? Are you from Madurai? Then work in Madurai. Why did you come to Madras? If we split Tamil Nadu into Coimbatore, Trichy, Ramanathapuram, Tanjore, then who will protect the Tamils in Ceylon? -That's what I meant. -You talk way too much! And that's exactly why I can't employ you. Now leave! You'll come to our area, right? Come. Kamatchi, get me those materials. -It's too high for me to reach. -Okay. Kamatchi. -Keep this file in my room. -Okay. -I'll get the materials-- -No! I'll do that. Bro, you could have controlled your tongue. I should have broken his teeth. -You are cribbing for no reason. -We didn't get the job. Go get the bike. -Kamatchi! -She has fallen! Are you Kamatchi? You look beautiful. Your parents could have named you Trisha or Nayanthara. Oh, my! I'm the one who caught you when you fell. Guys tend to find flaws even in the most beautiful of girls. Who will marry you if you're a cripple? For a guy like me it's fine. Some other guy will marry you and dump you within two months. Listen, don't break your limbs on your own. See you. Hey, what happened? -Who is he? -Who? I don't know. He came to meet Mr. Velu. Does it hurt? Bro! I'll call the doctor if it's hurting too much. Ranjani, what happened? Didn't I tell you not to meddle with the temple property? -We are jinxed now. -Shut up! -What happened? -She slipped from the first floor. First floor? Don't make a fuss, Dad. It's just a scratch. Guys tend to find flaws even in the most beautiful of girls. Who will marry you if you're a cripple? What did you say, Ma? Am I lying? I am just being honest. Guys tend to find flaws even in the most beautiful of girls. Who will marry you if you're a cripple? For a guy like me it's fine. Some other guy will marry you and dump you within two months. What happened? -What happened? -I dreamt of Kamatchi's eyes. -Kamatchi? -Eyes. Eyes? You should have prayed to Goddess Kamatchi and slept again. Why bring the roof down for this? Go back to sleep. I should meet Kamatchi tomorrow morning. Wait a minute. -Hello, ma'am. -I've been calling you for last two days. I had some work in the new building. Check the bathroom pipes. I'll call you later. It's a huge problem. Please fix it. It's leaking from the bottom. If necessary, we can change the pipes. -I'll fix it in ten minutes. -Okay. Give the new pipe. Bro, here. Give the screwdriver. Here you go. It's done. Shall we go? Can I use the bathroom? Very unprofessional. Make it quick. He's checking inside. -Shall I leave? -Carry on. Keep 100 rupees this time. Next time I'll give you more, okay? -Will you go carefully? -Yes, bro. -Idiot! -Sorry, bro. -God knows what's in his phone! -Look at the road and walk. -Are you sure you got the right address? -That's what I was told. Is that the girl? -Kamatchi. -My bag. You forgot your bag. -Is she the girl? -Yes. That's her. Thank God! She saw me. -Look over there. -Where? On your right. Greet my future wife. -He came to collect the garments. -Oh! That guy? Is he from this area? I haven't seen him here at all. Then why is he here? He's looking at us. Please don't look back. Sign it. It's about the temple property. Superb! I told you! Why didn't you listen to me? Look! He is stalking us. Wait, I'll be back. Why do you keep following us? I'll complain about you to the police. No, I didn't come for you. Kamatchi? No, I understand you. You are feeling bad because I chose her over you. For your generous heart, you will get a good guy for sure. I cannot fall in love with you. I love Kamatchi. Please forget me. What did he tell you? He's crazy. He calls you Kamatchi. Mannu, did you get to know about Lottai's temerity? -What's the matter? -Don't you know? Brother is building a wall for our temple, right? He's getting people to sign against it. He will be the do-gooder, stand in the election and nail us down. This is a request to preserve the temple land, sir. How dare you get signatures in my area against me? Beat him up! Brother? How did you fall flat, bro? Watch your step! Get that machete. Get it. Shankar! Pick it up! Stab him! Kill him, Shankar! Mannu, run away. -Run. -Kill him! -Lottai will kill you. -Kill him, I say! Run! Save yourself. -Shankar, he's escaping. -Don't, bro. -Give it to me. -No need, bro. -Let him go. -Give it to me! Brother! Who is this fellow in our area making Lottai and Mannu run? He's our boy. He's from this area of course. He is an expert in what he does. If someone steals your clothesline or any problem that needs to be solved, our boss will solve everything singlehanded! People love him. Start the bike. You're a matured man and you're instigating youngsters! He's poking his nose in everything. How can we keep quiet? You have no other way to handle this. It's election time, right? If you do anything wrong then Lottai will win, right? -This issue is regarding the temple. -I'll handle that. Don't interfere. We'll deal with him post elections. -Got it? -Fine. Now get going. He came to our area and made us run. How humiliating! We should have... What is your uncle saying? -Wait for the elections to get over. -Why should we wait? It's easy for him to say. Who will face all the insults? Just wait and watch. I'll ensure that he tells us to kill Lottai. Shankar. You missed a golden chance and you're sitting here. What do I do with you? Stop! Why are you hitting him? -You don't know, bro. -He's our boy. He's one of us. Shankar. If you had killed Mannu... I would have handed over my position to you. But I will not do so now. Do you know why? You kill him. Just say that you killed him. I'll give you my position. Why to get troubled, bro? Shankar, it isn't a big deal to fight or kill someone. But when you hit below the belt without the victim being aware, that's more critical. That's your strong point. Listen. Kill Mannu. I'll make sure you kill Mannu. If you kill Mannu... I'll make you the most renowned rowdy of this area. I'll make you a big gangster. A good one like me. Okay? Hey, come here. You're giving him too much importance. A rowdy revered by all. Even a girl won't trust him! I cannot fall in love with you. I love Kamatchi. Kamatchi asked us to come. It's regarding the garments supply. Listen, if you want to offer him a job, I'll quit. We'll handle him. You handle your job. -I didn't mean that. -Do your work. As far as he is concerned, my name is Kamatchi. -Why? -That's how it will be. We'll expand our business. Buy more sewing machines. Collect the materials. You should supply promptly. Don't keep your weapons in my shop, bro. Wait, our boy is trying something new. -What, bro? -Kill it! Kamatchi. Drink this juice. You can work later. Juice, huh? Yes. -Drink. -Do you want? It's okay. What is this dress? This one? Brother stitched it for his future wife. He's looking for a princess who will fit in this dress. Hey, bro. Taking measurements, huh? It's been a while since I saw you. How's my shirt? Superb, right? Because it wasn't stitched here. The shop looks great. Even though you had to borrow money, you have done it up well. Instead of her you could have hit on Ranjani. If I marry someone like her... she'll pick me up even if I am sprawled drunk on the road. If I get married to a rich girl, she will get tanked, trample me and throw me on the road. Why to get into such trouble? She's good enough for me. -We shouldn't let go the temple land. -We'll do it. Why didn't you do your research properly? -I was ashamed. -What happened? That land isn't even the property of the temple. They have the documents. The judge is mad at me. -What do you mean? -Why don't you understand? It's their ancestral property. They want to donate it to the temple. If given a chance, they might file a case against God. Don't bring such cases to me in the future. I'll be embarrassed. Take this. Sir... sir! That land is temple property. You can ask anyone in that area. Sir! How could they turn the tables, bro? They have put us in a difficult situation. I'll make them run for their money. Oh, my! What... Don't worry about Lottai. Uncle, my sister is calling. Our son has been kidnapped. What? I'll come home right away. Let's go. Please take care. I'll manage. You can carry on. Please call me later. -What happened? -Someone kidnapped the chairman's son. Who did? If you don't know then say so. Why are you staring at me? Why are they in a rush? -Why is Kamatchi going? -She is the owner's friend. -Is she coming back for lunch? -I don't know. Do you know anyone who hates the chairman? He doesn't have any specific enemy. -What time did you receive the call? -Around ten. -Did they demand a ransom? -Yes. I got a call saying that our son has been kidnapped. Don't worry about anything. I've informed all the check posts and instructed to check all the cars. He couldn't have crossed Chennai. He'll call back for sure. Let's receive that single call, sir. We can track the call and arrest him. -Where's Mannu? -He has gone to inquire. How long have you been working in this house? What are you doing here? I don't know why it keeps honking. I'll check it now. -You can't stop here for too long. -I'll check and leave now. -Go check. -Me? Go! -Good afternoon. -What do you want? I need to see Kamatchi, not you. Oh, God! Help me. -He's asking for you. -If I go... -Go. -How can I go? Go. I'll handle it here. Kamatchi. What? I need to talk to you. Go. No way. Will you come here or shall I come there? Call me. Come here. Our love-- My father is here. -Shall I come? -No need. Come upstairs. Why did you come here? I came to see my sweetheart. Do you know what's happening here? I believe someone has kidnapped the chairman's son. Just leave now. I have to go. Give me a kiss and I'll leave. Listen to me. Someone might see us. Why do you get so scared? As if looting public property wasn't enough that now he is trying to conquer the temple land. That's why God has punished him! Have you seen his face? He looks drunk all the time. After Kamal Haasan only Venkat Prabhu has given him the right role. Listen, any politician will stop looting only when their loved one dies. I know. I know he pays you well. I understand. I know who kidnapped that boy. I'll find out his whereabouts by evening. Don't cry. I'll tell you something but don't misunderstand me. Don't trust these rich people. They'll keep you with them and suddenly crucify you. Don't trust that girl who is always around you. She will surely ditch you. Why do you cry if I say anything about the father or the daughter? Don't cry, okay? -Go. -Kiss? Fine, I'll go. Trace the call and start recording. Sir, speak. Wait, Uncle. Do you know whom are you talking to? I am Mannu. How dare you kidnap my brother and negotiate with me? I'll kill you by evening. Why is he talking like this? I told you to kill Lottai. He has the audacity to kidnap our boy and threaten us! We shouldn't let him go, Uncle. -Get the details of Lottai's goons. -Okay, sir. Let them be here. Go alone and inquire. Sir, don't worry. I'll definitely-- Hey, let go. He has the audacity to threaten me. Go arrest him! I know how to deal with him. Go! Mannu, I don't know how you'll do it. I just want my son back. Kill Lottai and his goons. Go! -Did you see Lottai? -No, bro. I have been here since morning. I haven't seen him at all. -Where is Lottai? -I don't know, Mannu. -I really don't know, Mannu! -Give it to me. -Mannu, let me go. -Tell me. -Bro, did Lottai come here? -No. -Did you see Lottai? -No. -If he comes, ask him to call me. -Okay, bro. He is here. Let's kill him. Did you see Lottai? No. The chairman's son is missing. Lottai is missing as well. Did he kidnap that boy? Mannu, you came. You're here because of me. I thought you would come alone. Did you get scared and got your men along? Look at me. Do you see anyone with me? If you have the guts, come alone. Come on! Get lost, you black thunder. Come on! Come on! I'll finish you! Come on! I'll finish you! You thought you could kill me when I'm drunk. Come what may I'll kill you! Are you stabbing me furtively? I'll... Lottai. How many more to go? One more, Mannu. Go to your aunt's house. Ma, I have no connection with Lottai. He doesn't come to our shop anymore. Mannu kills anyone who mentions Lottai. I'll call you back when things are in control. Keep this money. -For you? -I'll take it from my shop. -Call me once you reach. -Okay. There's just one. Hey, bro! Raju! Raju, what happened? Get up! Raju. Who else is there after me in this area? Only you. I'll make you the most renowned rowdy of this area. I'll make sure you kill Mannu. You crucified me, Lottai! Bro, this is Shankar's new shop. The lights are on. I think he's inside. -Check inside. -Yes. Mannu, I didn't do it. Trust me. It was Lottai. -Lottai? -I swear, Mannu. I am innocent, Mannu. Please believe me. Get hold of him. Catch him! -Search on that side. -Come with me. -Okay, bro. -Hurry up! -Look over there. -Okay. Shit! Oh, no! Guru is missing as well. Mannu has called for a war. Ask everyone to be on their toes. Hey, you can't touch me. The police are standing there. I already told you that Lottai is to be blamed, not me. If you lay a finger on me the police will pounce on you. They will crucify you. I didn't do anything. It's Lottai... If you scream, I'll kill you. Hey! What are you doing? What timing! Did you come when I called you guys? Why do you make a face at me when I am talking to you? Mannu, I swear I don't know anything. Lottai is the culprit. He locked the boy in the shop and... Aren't you a part of his gang? It was long ago, Mannu. I saved you, remember? You bet Lottai has left a tough man behind. He made you bite the dust, didn't he? -Ma! -No! My beloved son! How could this happen to me? Visu was drunk and sprawled on the railway track. It's a suicide case. The report confirms the same. Will you let me down? Sir, I don't know all that. What are you investigating at a funeral? The report confirms that he died due to excessive consumption of alcohol. He is jobless. Don't you have any sense? Get back to work. Serve tamarind curry, if you have. Bring the tamarind curry. Go have some food. The food has been ordered from Saravana Bhavan. How did you have the heart to leave your mother and depart? How could he leave us behind? I'm sure he wouldn't have done it. He is not bold enough to kill anybody. What is his motive? He isn't interested in any materialistic thing. How can you be crying nonstop like this? Who will console your parents? Don't cry. If he didn't kill my brother, he'll come to see me for sure. Eat, my dear. Open your mouth. Who is there? Who is it? Kamatchi. You can leave. It's okay. Go. It might be important. I don't feel like to leave you alone. Don't cry thinking of your brother. -I'll be back soon. -Okay. -Mannu. -What is it? -I inquired in your garments company. -Okay. Kamatchi got him the job. I think they love each other. I heard from our sources. What is it, sister-in-law? Hey, whom are you looking for? -Kamatchi. -What? -Ranjani. -Where is Shankar? Where is your lover, Shankar? You got him the job, right? Do you know what will happen if you are called for an interrogation? Do you know how the cops interrogate women? Shankar is at my house. This is my house. Who are you? -Shankar! -Kamatchi, what happened? He is looking for Shankar. Where are you? Where is he? Speak up! Where is he hiding? Tell me. You lied to me about him being here. I'll smash your face! Why are you creating a ruckus when we have no one to defend us? Ask your uncle's daughter. Shankar is in love with her. This is Ranjani's factory. Why did you bring me here? It's safer if you take me to the cops. Shut up. It's safe for you to hide in the factory. Are you trying to save me? How long is this going to go? I have been framed in this situation. The cops will not catch the ones who loot the trains and smuggle. They will nab me with ease. Our police department is that smart! -We can discuss this inside. -Wait. Before I forget, let me speak. I came to thank you. Do you know my life changed after I met you? You are the woman I love the most after my mother. You trust me so much that you're ready to risk your life in order to save me. This is you. Bless you. Please forget me. Marry someone who owns a big factory like this. You are like a mannequin in a fancy show room. You should be living comfortably. I am like a product you get on sale. We will not last for long. Don't get married in a hurry. Wait for a couple of years. We spent a lot of time together. The society will talk about us. It's my fate. I have to go to prison for a murder I did not commit. That hurts me a lot. Do you know the killer? Everybody knows that Lottai is the culprit. On top of that, there was an issue pertaining to the temple land. He killed the boy due to frustration. Lottai wanted to make me a renowned rowdy in our area. He wanted to give me all the fame but ended up framing me! Then catch Lottai first. How can I? He is dead. I am sure he must have had an accomplice. Catch him. Even if you get one witness, you can escape. Do you think I'm James Bond to find a witness? If you run away from problems, you'll be running all your life. You can do this. I have faith in you. Don't put me on a pedestal. I am not worth it. Look, I can't imagine living with anyone other than you. I want you. We must lead a life together. We must be happy in the eyes of our society. You need a witness for that to happen. This is the safest place for you. The police will search everywhere except here. I'll be here to help you in any case. I haven't spoken to my mother in days. Will you call her for me? How can I live without you, son? We need to be careful. -Stay right here. -Tell them to be here. -What? -I have told them. Go check. Wait. -Diwakar, come here. -Yes, bro. Be alert. I'll be back. I'm coming. Don't be impatient. -Mannu! -Shut the door. Sir? Why do you look so worried? I asked you to go back to your hometown. Why are you still here? Look at that! How can I leave my family and go? You have no other option. The police are suspecting us. They followed me. I sneaked in here. This is a child's play. Why are you getting hyper? Mannu, what? You showered so fast. I'll get it. Why did you call me here? I just wanted to ask you about the money. Which money? What do you mean? You promised to pay me if I kidnapped the boy. You'll get the money. Don't keep coming in my area. Why do you get flustered at the drop of a hat? Anyway, the tailor has been framed. Let him get caught by the police. All your crimes will be pinned on him. You know how the police work. Why are you worried? He is still missing. -Till then we need to be alert. -Fine. Your uncle will handle it. The inspector will not let go. Ever since Lottai died his eye is on me. He is trying his luck. If you get caught, the game is over. So, Shankar needs to be found. Don't worry. We'll kidnap his mother. I'll hit you now! They are just looking for an excuse to arrest me. You and your stupid ideas! Forget it, Mannu. He will-- Why didn't you knock first? You're walking in as if you're the owner! I came to deliver the food. Who ordered it? We didn't order. -I'll thrash you for barging in-- -Wait! I ordered for food. Please put it there. I am-- Ask her to leave. Don't be scared, Mannu. The entire police force is looking for him. He'll surely get caught. I need the money for my family. Please think of my situation. Hi, bro. Are you smoking? Be careful with this one. -In the lodge? -Yes. We fixed a camera in the room, right? I have got a breaking news. Go inside. Hi, bro. -Come here, bro. -Go inside. -He kept his word and brought her. -Smart! A mail is pending for a long time. If I don't send it today, I'll be in trouble. Keep your hands to yourself. What are you doing? I don't like all this. Don't touch me. Trying to play hard to get, huh? Let me go! I'm leaving. Get back there. -Don't be a prude. -Let me go. Don't act so innocent. Let me go! -Shut up! -Akash! It's just a matter of time. Akash! -Remove her scarf. -Gag her mouth. No one is going to hear you. Akash! Listen, bro. Get up, bro. -How did you come here? -Listen to me. I don't want to harm you at all! Hey, look! I befriended you and I got beaten up. -If they see me with you, I'll be dead. -Hear me out, bro. They will kill me like how you killed that boy. I didn't kill him! I don't know about that. If you don't leave, I'll call the nurse. -Nurse! -Hey! Wait! I can call her myself. Hey, nurse. Come here. They will believe me if I say that we killed the boy. What did I do? You got scared, right? I am going through the same. I'm hiding for a crime I didn't commit. -Lottai killed him. -You didn't? That's what I was trying to say. You know I don't get involved in major mediating issues. Lottai is dead and gone. I don't know what to do. You are right, bro. That day when I went to the temple, I saw Damodaran. Do you know what happened that day? They are building up a wall all around, bro. You kept your promise. I should thank you. Why are you thanking me? Thank Visu instead. He has given his life and got it done for us. It's sad that we have lost two lives. This is what happened. I'm telling you I didn't kill him. Chairman Damodaran and Lottai are the culprits. Lottai said he will do me a favor and nailed me unfavorably! Bro, if we nab Damodaran then we can escape. We? Why are you including me? You and I have mediated so many issues. If the police catch me they will nab you as well. We never did anything big. The police would not know that we are petty mediators. According to them, you are a criminal as well. I'll nab Damodaran. Who else is there for me? Who do I have other than you? Okay, stop with the drama. Do you want me to help you? But you cannot leave me midway. My dear friend! How can I ditch you? -Who are you? -I have to go inside. There is a patient inside. -Yes. -I'm the patient's brother. Did they leave? Nurse, give him the bill. He will pay. Hey! This is the chairman's house. He must be inside. Go check. -Is this the house? -Yes. Check if he is inside. What? Do you want me to go? Why should I take the blame for what you did? I don't have anybody else. You have to help me. -Wait, I will go. -Go. This stone seems to be kept here to climb the wall. I do all the hard work and he gets the benefits. Bro, it is pitch dark inside. -Shut up. -Look for the switch. Oh, my! Look here! -Don't shout! They'll wake up. -Don't gag my mouth. Who are you? Did you come to steal something? -Sir, would a thief fall at your feet? -Let go of my feet! Drop your lungi and then talk. Who are you? Sir, don't you know him? He is from our area. The one who killed the chairman's son. -I'll hit you. -Only then he'll understand. Did you kill that boy? Sir, I didn't kill him. You know very well that Lottai is the culprit. -Lottai? -Why are you repeating him? I told him what you spoke in the temple. Don't get scared. We will not betray the police. Lottai was with me the whole day. Both of us were drinking together. They are stealing the temple land. It's irritating, sir. They are the ruling party. Leave it. I'll talk to the leader. I can manage. Is there any problem? -The chairman's son has been kidnapped. -Is that so? Mannu is spreading a rumor that I kidnapped the boy. Stay here for the time being. Don't go there. It will cause a problem. How will Mannu kill his nephew? It's all about the power. Who doesn't want power? Don't you watch the news? The nearest and dearest are often killed. That's right. Even the inspector knows this. Inspector knows about Mannu? Sir, then can't you talk to him? You heard what I said. Go meet him. Let me live peacefully. We are scared, sir. We'll be killed. Does that mean you will barge into my bathroom? As if we can book a room and ask. -Get lost! -Let's scoot. He might piss on our face. Please wake up. Aren't you Shankar? Yes, sir. How dare you kidnap me! No, sir. I am scared. I did it out of fear. What can I do? Why have you tied me up? Sir, you are behaving like you don't know anything. You are looped into everything. You know everything about the murder. That idiot told me-- -Damodaran told us. -Damodaran? -What did he say? -Mannu, murder and temple land... -Tell him. -Yes, sir. He told us everything. The murderer is roaming freely while I have to hide. -You can't nab a killer-- -Shut up! There is no one in your area willing to refute him. All I want is one proof. We can arrest him. Yes. If you don't get any proof, will you send us to the gallows? It is a long process. A case will be filed. Eventually you're going to hang us. -I'm in a mess because of you. -Keep quiet! I have a witness. He's innocent. -Witness? -Who is it? The chairman's daughter will defend him. Why will she defend him? She will defend her lover. Do you think I'm her lover? I didn't fall for the chairman's daughter. I'm in love with Kamatchi who works for them. Kamatchi is the chairman's daughter. Now I know why you're unable to catch Mannu. -I'll hit you. -It's all muddled in your head. A rusk and a butter biscuit look the same. But they taste different, right? You have tied me up and talking nonsense. Untie me and I'll shoot you. The chairman's daughter looks horrible. Only Kamatchi looks good. You might have been fooled like everyone else. Ranjani has fooled you by calling herself Kamatchi. She's a decent girl. Don't say anything about her. I've interrogated Kamatchi. She told me everything. Even Ranjani accepted it. But I don't know why she fooled you. She came clean to me. Look how girls are fooling around in front of you! -Did you fall in love and marry? -Shut up! Untie me! His parents must have fixed his wedding. Shankar! -Shankar! -Shankar! -Where did he go? -Untie me! He has put me in a spot again. I'm not involved in this. -Untie me. -Leave me alone. I didn't tie you up. He did, sir. Just twist your hand. You'll be free. Untie me! Hey, when did you come? Did you follow him? Lottai is the killer, right? Why are you looking clueless? Is your head aching? Shall I get you something to eat? Ranjani, I don't want food. You haven't eaten anything. What did you say? Why did you call me Ranjani? Everything is a lie! You made a fool out of me. I loved you so sincerely, right? Did I hide anything from you? I told you about my dreams featuring Hansika, Trisha. -I did it just for fun. -Fun indeed! It might be fun for you. For me, it's an end. Why are you getting worried for such a small matter? You call this small? It's very important to me. They are accusing me for a murder I didn't commit. If they get to know that I love you... they will put all the blames on me. And close my chapter once for all. Mannu will know by now. I wonder what he'll do to me. I would have left long back. You pulled me into this vortex to find your brother's murderer. Look, life will have its share of problems. There can be problems in life but life per se should not be a problem. Would you have helped me if you knew who I was? I would have run for my life. Why to invite trouble? Trouble follows me everywhere as it is. Imagine adding you to it. Will you buy a dress material from some brand and ask me to stitch it? You won't. It's the same logic. You are rich. It will not suit me at all. Let's end this. Let me go. Shall we end it? Fine, that's it. Get lost! Where did all the respect go? Your love is so demeaning. If I'm facing a problem, you're leaving me. Do you deserve any respect? Who was there for you? You don't have a single witness proving your innocence. But I believed in you. My love made me trust you. Till this very moment. I'm having a hard time and you're running away. I thought of you as my life partner. You deceived me. Kamatchi. Don't cry. I was so insensitive. I'm so used to running away from problems, you see. I did the same with you. You were wrong and so was I. We are equal now. Kamatchi. I have seen my mother cry every day. I decided that I will never make my wife cry. Don't cry. We have come to a compromise. Why are you crying, Kamatchi? I'm not Kamatchi. I'm Ranjani. Can't you correct me while you hug me tight? -Hi, dude. -Hi, bro. -What took you so long? -I got the number. That's his number. His name is Bharani. I got it from the lodge register. I am scared. Even if girls are blackmailed the police will never know. They will pay money. They are regular rowdies. If we get caught, we are dead. There is no chance of getting caught. Our phone number will not be seen. I have that technology. How long will we do petty crimes? Don't we have to settle down with a big amount? You said that he is rich. He'll get richer with this election. He'll agree to pay in a lump sum. Keep quiet. You killed the boy and now you're hiding. You and... -What is his name? -Mannu. Is it a wrong number? He denies knowing Mannu. He is staying at our lodge. How would I not know? I am sure it's him. Look into it first. We can do whatever we want. Okay. -We can take his help. -Okay, sir. Don't keep grieving, Ma. -Please eat. -Okay. Take care. Even among our boys... -Is it Bharani? -Yes. -Go on, talk. -I'll talk to him later. Where is he? I haven't seen him recently. He is not in town. -What's the matter? -One of his relatives died. That's why he couldn't attend the funeral. -He said so. -Okay. Her father committed suicide ashamed by the obscene video uploaded online. I don't know where he is. We haven't seen him for long. He never comes home. Even if I want to talk I can do so only through Mannu. Can you give me Mannu's number? -Note it down. -Tell me. How long do I have to wait? You could have got it yourself. Mannu's friend disappeared after the murder. If we nab him, we can nail Mannu. How do you know everything? Ranjani told me. -Go to the chairman's office. -I came hearing your story. If you get me into trouble, you are dead. Wait over there. I will settle everything. Bharani has come. Why did you come here? It's important, Mannu. You could have called me. I did. You never picked up! Fine, come. Get inside. Mannu is not here. Let's go. Wait, man. He'll be inside. Why the hell did you come here? I told you I'll send the money. Don't shout unnecessarily. Someone has recorded our conversation and now he is blackmailing me. That's why I kept calling you. But you wouldn't answer! -What else to do but come in person? -What do you mean? I received a call this morning. He is threatening me with a video. -Give me your phone. -Why? -I want to call Mannu. -Here. I gave him a piece of my mind. No more calls after that. Hey! I'm standing right outside the building. I think you don't have the signal inside. What did you say? He stepped out of the car. If you are inside the building, you won't get the signal. Can you hear me now? Mannu, I know all about your plan and setting it into action. I know you and Bharani killed the boy. If I go to the police and utter the truth, my dear, you'll be dead. How much money do you want? Money? -Money? -Will you give any amount? Yes. If the police get the video, I'll kill you for sure. Let me discuss and call you back. He is talking about money and video. He has got my number. He must be a powerful person. -Bro. -What? -I got it. -What? Someone is blackmailing him. He thought we are the blackmailers. He fell into our trap by himself. He is ready to pay any amount. I agreed to pay. Why are you threatening me? -How much do you need? -He's ready to pay any amount. Let's ask him for half a million. We can have share it equally. Is half a million enough? Shall we ask for one million? I'll get a new film for three million. You think you're-- Give it to me. How much do you want? I want two million in cash. Venue is RK Nagar, Omni bus stand. I want it in one hour and only Bharani should come. If you send your goons after me, this video will go to the police. Understood? They are using different men to negotiate. I think it's a big gang. Half for you, half for me. We can lead a great life. -No need. -Don't try to brainwash me. I'm framed in this murder. I can be arrested any moment. Life is going to be easy for you. You'll get settled with Ranjani. I'll be the one who will suffer. What have you ever done for me? If I take over her factory, won't I give you a job? As if I won't be there for you! If I go to work, I'll get paid. Give that to me now. How will you get the cash? I have the election money. Wait, I'll be back. -Don't feel bad, bro. -Look! Mannu. I have seen him somewhere. He is often seen with Mannu. -That's Bharani. -Who? Here you go. Handle it carefully. Look! I'm sorry, bro. Be careful. Don't get into any mess. -Come back with the video. -I'll handle it. You can go. That's the money for the video. We should somehow get the video, not him. Then all of them will be under our mercy, got it? Keep an eye on Mannu. I'll follow Bharani. How can I do it alone? Don't leave me. -I'm telling you. -Take me along. You got me into a fix again. He is here. Don't get caught. Be on your toes. Ask him for the cash first. Give him the video only after you know the cash is intact. -Understood? -Okay, I'll handle it. Where's the money? -Give me the video. -I have the video. But I'll give it to you only after I check the cash. Give me the video first. Here's the video. Give me the cash. Here. Sir, I'll take this bike. We are at the bus stand. Okay, sir. -I'm taking it. -Grab him. Run! Wait! Move! Make it fast. -Aren't you the tailor? -Yes, bro. Why are you running behind me? Here. You wanted the walkie-talkie, right? Catch him! We are caught now. The police are here. I told you right then. What is the problem? Didn't you see the news? A girl committed suicide. Someone had taken pictures of her and threatened her father! They took the cash and still uploaded the photos online. Both, the father and the daughter committed suicide. Why did you shout over there? We are in a mess. We are as good as dead. If we get arrested our life will be ruined! There's no chance of us getting caught. It's possible only if we upload the content. This is a shared video. We did everything with a fake ID. So, there's no chance. If just one girl goes to the police and complains about us, we all will be behind bars. Do you think girls have the guts to complain? It's a disgrace to them. None of them will dare to complain. You could have given the video to her father as soon as he paid us. Who thought he would commit suicide, bro? Akash, let's not get into trouble anymore. Our clients are about ten to eighty years old. Did anyone snitch? We uploaded that girl's video. Did anyone complain? Did anyone complain about the teacher's video? Not a single person did. We got into trouble when the police got involved in the suicide case. A video with just 1000 views is now viral. Why? Did you think it was sheer concern over that girl? They all are simply desperate. As long as they don't get a chance, they are all good. When they do, all of them are just scoundrels. I am scared we will get caught. You should have thought of it when you got your bike and phone. It wasn't your first time that you got so anxious. Then what? Don't fret yourself. Brother. What did the police ask you? It wasn't a problem. It was just a general inquiry. They didn't have any video. We are safe. What happened to your task? It got messed up a big time. He called the police and we had to escape. He called the police? Give me your phone. I'll make him pay for this. Tick him off. How dare you call the police! Shall I set them after you? I want the cash in next ten minutes or else I'll upload the video. The world will watch. -It was Shankar, right? -Some boy spoke. He's using these twits to get his way. He brought the police. He's being smart. They are worse than Mannu. They capture videos of young girls. They blackmail them by uploading it online. Do you know how many girls have committed suicide? You could have told the police over there. Will they believe me? Even you didn't believe me. How will they? Do you want to put me behind bars? Forget it. Let's make some other plan. I cannot let them go easily. They are justifying their crime. Of course they'll act righteous. Half of the people who stand up for the national anthem in the theatre, do so halfheartedly. -No one is bothered. -I can't be like that. Why only fight for the girls who are related to us? Why can't we fight for all of them? If he shows off to a girl, he isn't a man. The knight in shining armor is! When Oviya was ridiculed in a reality show, didn't everyone support her? They are girls from a decent family who will feel ashamed to complain. They will be in such a dilemma. Do you know how many of them attempt suicide? What do you want us to do? They should be caught. We should be proved innocent as well. We will join Oviya's army. Why are you going gaga over Oviya now? Mr. Kamal is feeling bad for her Twitter. I have a soft corner for women. Shouldn't I empathize? How can I help? Look over there. Who are they? Hey! Where is Shankar? Did he ditch you and disappeared again? Shankar, where are you? Come out now. You use boys to blackmail us. You'll end up dead today. Bro, the police are here. Sir, this gang takes videos of girls. Catch them! -Run! -Let's escape. Bharani, wait! -Sir, come. -Let me go. He's the one who killed Lottai. And the chairman's son as well. Mild tactics will not work with him. -If you don't speak up-- -Sir, don't shoot! I didn't kill Lottai. It was Mannu. He asked me to kidnap the boy. But he caught me, sir. Don't believe him, sir. He's lying. I didn't kill the boy. Don't pass the buck on to me. Let me go. Sir, I have the video and all the evidence. Don't believe him. Shankar! Where is the video? Give it to me. Unless I get it, none of you will step out alive. Let's give it to him. Bro, then you'll let us go, right? Akash, let's give it to him. Where's the money? I need to see the money. Ask your man to bring it. Money is prior to us. Understood? Give the money and take the video. Give me the money first. Mannu, your evidence is here. You can't escape. Surrender to the police. It will do you good. I'll beat you all! How dare you blackmail girls taking videos of them? You are trapped now. The police are here. I have called them. -Mannu, listen to me. -We are in trouble. I told you right then that the police will come after us. They came to inquire even at the cafe. Do you know who is he? We killed the chairman's son. And he got caught for the crime instead of us. Our son has been kidnapped. Have you arranged the money? If you don't pay, your son will be dead. Do you know whom are you talking to? I am Mannu. Do you know who are we? We are Lottai's men. You kidnapped my boy and now you dare to bargain with me! Why did you drag Lottai into this? It was Mannu on the phone. He was threatening me. He'll get scared only if I bring Lottai in the story. It's no big deal. We have the son. One million is nothing for his father. No need, bro. The police will arrest us. How can we back out now? We'll deal with it when the time comes. Bro, it's getting late. My mother will be worried. I'll come back tomorrow. Don't you want a new mobile? -Sit down. -It's okay. I'll ask my father to get me one. How can you go back on your word? Stay a little longer. You can go once we get the money. I'm leaving, bro. Please let me go. Let him go. He wants to go. I can find my way home. -Push him down. -Sit quietly. If I tell my uncle, Mannu, you'll will be dead. How dare you manhandle me! If I tell him, he will beat you to a pulp. Just wait and watch! I'll snitch to my uncle. How could you do this, Akash? We are doomed. -Govind. -He might die. -Save him. -Take him away. Let's rush him to the hospital. Poor fellow! Come out! How can you be so heartless, Akash? We are in trouble! Akash, you killed him. You killed him and framed me! You will pay for this. Only if both of you walk out alive. That's the way to grip. He's Mannu. You thought he was a sack of mud? He's a boulder to reckon with. Beat them black and blue, Mannu. Kill him! Oh, my! Do you know who he is? He's the leader of all the thugs in our area. You thrashed Mannu to the ground. Hey! Don't come near me. You're too tall. I don't want you. Stand aside. You are quite sensitive out of all. We can fight gently. Wait, we can talk it out. It is he who I have called. Come on! Catch him! He's trying to escape. You record videos of girls and publish them online, don't you? You deserve this! Get up, Akash! Akash! Get up! Akash, Govindaraj and Santhanu were classmates. Santhanu runs a cyber cafe. When girls watch videos in his cafe, he films and blackmails them. Keep this carton in the office. Go. Shankar, you have become famous in a day. You're in the headlines. It just fell in place, sir. Ask them to check the uniforms. You'll soon be the son-in-law of our area's chairman. And you're still stitching clothes. How can I forget my roots, sir? A man must stand on his own feet, sir. In a way, what you said makes sense. You're so addicted to your phone! Why are you hitting my son? Make sure your boy studies well. He doesn't need a phone. Do you know how they misuse it? My son will not be influenced like that. Your son may not... but this can brainwash easily. It has pros and cons equally. I know my son very well. Mind your own business. You can continue playing, dear. The children shouldn't be taught. The parents need to know the reality first. Such a pain in the ass!
