Where are the other girls? Uh, they're booked right now. They're in the other rooms. Can you... Can you get them? Yeah, I can call them. But it'll probably take... No, just... Weren't you just in another room right now? It's been an hour, I mean, come on. Yeah, but they're not available right now. The lights. Turn around. - What is your name? - Kasie. Kasie? - He's asking how old you are? - Twenty-three. Twenty-three? - Do you have a boyfriend? Tell me. - Tell him right now. I don't fucking believe this girl. He's your boyfriend tonight, okay?

I'm sorry, I didn't know they owed you money. I wouldn't have given them the keys. You want me to call the cops? Huh? You want to wait inside? Come on, I'll get you some water. I'll be fine. Um... Hello? Hey. Hey, yeah, I was just wondering what you were doing. - They fucking lost? - Who's in here? Seriously, zip that shit up, take the shit, and get the fuck out of here. Where the hell's that bullet? I got it. Don't worry about it. In the next 30 minutes when this shit kicks in, I don't give a fuck where we're going. - Kasie... - Yeah, we're gonna have a party tonight. - Oh, I do. - Ah, perfect. Speaking of which... Am I lighting this up for everybody or... - Can you get a refund? - No, dude. You want one? Anything working yet? - All right, now we're all having fun. - Yo, this shit's fire, - where'd you get this from? - Your boy came through. Don't touch my fucking balloons. What the fuck? Hey! Not blue. Don't fucking hurt blue! Stop! Let's get the fuck outta here. Yo, look at this guy's... - Juanita! Please don't leave. - I'm sorry, mi hija. - I took another job at a hospice. - But please, you can't leave. - You have to give me enough time to find someone else. - I'm sorry! You told me months ago you were looking for someone else. - Juanita, you can't do this to me. - It's too late. I have to go. - If it's about the money issue, I can give you more money. - No, it's not just about money. - We don't know when he's going to die. - Please don't leave. It could be months. It could be tomorrow! Put him in a hospice. Would you do that? Put him in a hospice! Do you understand? There's help there. There'll be other people. - I don't want him in a hospice! - I can't do this anymore. - I don't want to put my dad in a hospice! - You're not listening to me! I can't do this anymore. It's too hard. I can't. - I'll talk to the hospice about giving you a discount. - You can't do this to me. You'll figure it out. Hey, Carey. I haven't seen you in like a month, so I just wanted to see how you were doing. I was thinking we could go to Koreatown Plaza tomorrow to grab some lunch. I know you like the food court there, so I could just meet you there. Let me know, okay? Bye. All right, all right. Hey, excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second? Sure, I'm really late to work, though. - Miss, can I ask you a really quick question? - I'm sorry, I'm late... I was just wondering if you could like take care of my dad, be like a live-in nurse. I'm sorry, I already have a full-time job. - You've got to leave. - I'm not even going inside. Do your dad a favor, put him in hospice. - Miss! Miss, can I ask you... - No! - I'm so sorry. - Get off me! Out. Get out. Go. Mind if I get one of those? Thank you. If you don't mind me asking, how old do you have to be to work in there? I've seen girls as young as 15 who say they're 18. - Fifteen? - Mm-hmm. Wow, quinceañeras, huh? Huh? Quince... You don't know what a quinceañera is? You ever been to one? My sister's having one. Ah, shit. - What's your name? - Kasie. Kasie, I'm Octavio. - Nice to meet you. - I've got to go park this car, but I'll be right back. I'd rather be talking to you... You have one unheard message. Hey Carey, so, like, it's just that... I'm kind of in a bind right now. And like Dad's live-in nurse just quit. I was just wondering if like there was any possibility that you could come over and watch him. End of message. To delete this message, press... - You play the piano? - Hmm? You can play it if you want. I'm glad you're here. This should be more than enough to get you by through the month. - Thank you. - And then next month, when you need more, let's talk. Don't run away. It's a lot of money. - I won't. - No? You're uh... - What? - The... The... Never mind. I'll take care of Dad. You can come in. Yeah, just uh... give me a second. Do you want something to eat, or water? No, I'm good. Um... We can share the living room. Old times. Do you want your blanket? Sure. I got. I got it, I got it. Okay, it's all right. I can tuck you in. Okay. Yeah, but you don't have to. It's fine. Just stop. - You're not even tucking yourself. - Just stop. Stop! Isn't that the wallpaper that you and Mom put up? Mm-hmm. What? It's still ugly. The fuck was she thinking? Yeah, that's what Dad said too. You're not going to bed? Uh, in a little bit. You're just gonna keep staring at me all night, or... Are you gonna go to bed? Trying. - Nice. - Welcome. Okay, so this is the facility, huh? Yeah, we have about 5,000 square feet. - A showroom back here. - Yeah, Reece. We'll take some samples and see how it goes. Sure, so what I'm going to do is... Carey? Oh, fuck. How'd you get him outside? Pushed him. The bed has wheels, you know. Why are you laughing? What? Just remembering that time Dad caught me and Jamie up here. What were you guys doing? Just, you know... Innocent shit. Okay, really? No, she was giving me a blowjob. Well, no wonder he got mad. He just acted that way in front of you. He was laughing about it with me after. Oh, really? Yeah. Holy shit! What the fuck? What is wrong with you? Okay! Fucking... Oh, stop! Okay, okay, okay! - Jesus Christ. - Okay, truce. Truce. What the fuck is wrong with you? Truce, can I treat you to some ice cream, if you're not busy right now?

Not a care in the world. - Oh! - What? - It's okay, dude. - What? Oh, you think you're cool now? Me too. - Twinsies! - Definitely not gonna help you. You shouldn't smoke these things.

I'm just saying, you're just skinny. Why are you laughing? - What? Why are you laughing? - I was remembering about that fucking kid you beat up... when you were fat. Two little fat kids on the ground. You mean Derek? I wasn't that fat. You guys were like little... little gerbils rolling around and around. Oh, man, you fucked him up, though. You remember Dad? Yeah, how he gave me a high-five. Yeah. Oh, man. He was pretty proud of you. Did you ever think about what you want to do? What? Where is this... Kind of like, I don't know, a job. - Uh, yeah. - I don't mind giving you money, but... I'll get a job. It's fine. You really don't have to worry about me. I found something yesterday. What'd you find? - It was in the closet. - Okay. It's green. And black and white. - Um... - Your piano. - Okay. Okay. - Your piano. If you want to call it that. It's more like a little keyboard. I think it still works. I think it just needs some batteries. Don't you think it would be fun? Have a little recital? What do you say? Yeah. You used to love playing that thing. You went to school for fucking piano. - Yeah, I know I went to school for piano. - Yeah, and you didn't finish. I mean, you liked it, right? - Yeah, I liked it. - So why didn't you finish school? - Dad. - I just... Hmm. I mean, what if I got a job for that? - If you got a job... - If I got a job, will you go back to school? - Hmm. - All right? Maybe. Is that in? That's it, right? That sounds familiar. Wait... It just sounds like you're playing random keys. That's not fair. Uh... Shit. It works. I think I'm okay. Uh... Okay. Hey, um... Hmm? Are you ever curious about what I do for work? I mean, I know what you do. Have people... Have... Do you ever wonder where the money comes from? Um... I know where it comes from. Does it bother you? No. Kasie, it doesn't bother me. Kasie, whatever you had to do to keep Dad alive, I don't judge you for it, okay? I don't. I just think that you should... You should think about after, you know? Hey. Wanna go? I've been doing valet now for like seven... Six months, seven months, something like that. Do you take a class around here? Uh, class? What do you mean? Ballet... class. No, "valet," like I park cars. Not "ballet," like dance, no. I thought you said ballet. I was like, "That's cool." I don't do ballet. I mean, I got nothing against it. But it's just not the thing where I grew up, you know? So what about you? You, uh... You live alone? Roommates? No, I... I live with my dad, and then my brother, for now. My dad was like a dick to my brother, so he left when I was 15. What about your mom? Um, she left when we were kids. - What was that? - I don't know! It got too serious. And I don't like seriousness. Now it's awkward. - Excuse me? - Yeah? Are you a resident here? Yeah, uh, well no. I'm just his caretaker. I'm taking him back to his room. - Oh, what unit? - Uh, 1206. Excuse me, can you hold that? You know, my sister's kinda crazy, and I don't really know who... who's gonna be at the party. Gloria! - Hi! - Um... - ¿Es ella? - Yeah, yeah. Okay. Hi, Kasie! Nice to meet you. Make yourself at home. We're just kicking it. - We're relaxing, okay? - You want a drink? Yeah. What? - Hi. - This is Kasie. This is my youngest sister. - Nice to meet you. - She's the baby of the family. She's having a quinceañera soon. Umma! Hey, hey. Umma. Hey, it's Chunso. Umma, you don't recognize me? Look at me. So, um... Wanna come to my sister's quinceañera? Isn't it like private time with you? Yeah, I guess. But you're practically family now. Let's have fun at this wedding. Okay. You look very pretty today. Thank you. Hey. Move in with me. - Move in with you? - Uh-huh. I don't think it's a good idea right now. What are you talking about? You know how my dad's like really sick... What the fuck? Do you know how stupid you're being right now? Do you know what I just fucking offered you? - Did you guys go till late night that night? - Yeah, we did. Hey Tony, you got company, huh? Kasie, hey, you're gonna be with Martin next weekend. Sounds good. What is she, a doumi girl? - She's my doumi. - You brought a doumi to a wedding? I did. I always do. I did at John's wedding. - Can I get next? - Can I get next after that? All three of you. What's your schedule like next week? And then they tend to run away just like that. - Wow. - Go have fun. Hello? Hi. Hey, what's up? Everything okay at home? Yeah, I mean... Yeah. Everything's fine. Mm-hmm. Everything... Everything good? Yeah, everything's fine. Kasie, hello? Kasie, hello, hello? Yeah, I'm still here. Um... You know you could... You know you could talk to me, right? If you need to? Mm-hmm. Okay. Um... I'll just talk to you when you get back? Okay. All right. All right... Kasie... Kasie... Appa. Appa! Hey, wake up. Dad, get off me please! Dad! Let go! Huh? Yeah, yeah... I don't have money. Huh? Carey! Carey! Hey! Where'd you go? Carey, I found Dad on the floor. He could have died. I can't do this. Do what? I can't do this anymore. Kasie. I think... I think you should put him into hospice. I'm not gonna put him in hospice. He needs professional attention. Kasie. He's terminal. He's gonna die. It'll be easier on you, okay? You'll be able to live your own life. - We'll look for hospice cares in the morning. - No, I'm not going to do that. - It's the only thing to do. Stop playing fucking games! - I'm not gonna put him there. I'm not gonna leave him like you did! I'm not letting you leave. I've already decided. All right? What are you doing? Get the fuck out of my way, Kasie! Listen, I'm not coming back, okay? You fucking stay here and deal with this fucking shit, because I don't fucking need it! Carey! Whoa! Isn't this what you want? I even dressed up for you! Cheers... Whoa! So Juanita says you're a friend of hers. - Uh-huh. - Great. Well, we're gonna do everything that we can to help you. Did you have any questions for me specifically? Ah, no. How are you? I'm okay. It's just... - It's just hard. - It's always really hard with parents, but I just want to reassure you, putting your dad in hospice, it may seem like you're giving up, but actually, you're really honoring how he spends his final days. When did you want to bring him in? Um... Is tomorrow okay? Tomorrow's fine. Absolutely. Thank you. Hi. The name's Cathy. - Kasie. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Sometimes, like, they'll ask for your number or something. Oh, do I have to give it? No, no, no, of course you don't. Because I have a boyfriend. All right. Just like give them your KakaoTalk instead. - Okay. - So you don't have to give them your real number. Also, you know, just be sure to pretend to have fun. - Because, you know. - Uh-huh. Watch out for your drink. Okay. We have to pour them drinks as well as sit next to them? No, not always. But, you know, watch out for your drinks. And you don't have to do drugs if you don't want to. Drugs? Sometimes you... Sometimes they'll have drugs in the room. - You don't have to do it. Just be careful. - But I can if I want. - Yeah, just be careful. - All right. Okay, doesn't sound so hard. We'll see. - Oh, we're in this room. - Oops. Just knock and then go in. - Fucker owed like ten stacks. - Nah, he's still there. When we were younger, he used to take us to the fucking clubs - and get us in fucking fights... - All the fucking time. - All the fucking time. - It was a fucking thing. We grew up with that shit, dude. You remember that? Yo, where's he at these days? What the fuck are you doing here? Can you believe she just walked in your... Is she following you? Kasie? Yo, hey... - What the fuck? - Yo, no. Hey. Kasie! No, grab her. Grab her. Hey, nobody told you to fucking go. Kasie, sit the fuck down. Get your ass inside. Sit your ass fucking down.

We need anything better than your fucking loudmouth. Let's see... So what do you want again? Anything that'll make you twerk on over there. Anything, right? Okay. - We get the mood going. - Hold on, how about yours? Okay. Yeah! Setting the mood. Smile. He's a fool. He's a fool. Shut the fuck up. Drink! - That's what she does best. - I mean, look. Here. Let's try it again. You don't like that? Huh? - So Kasie, you got a boyfriend? - Doesn't matter. It does matter, 'cause I'm trying to take you out. That's fucking rude. Drink the whole goddamn thing. Why don't you fucking listen sometimes and just fucking do something? He's asking you to do something. Kasie, are you fucking dumb? Yo! Fucking listen to me. I finished mine. Oh, actually I got a little more. It's me and you. No? What do you mean? Now another one. There you go. Now you're listening. - Ah! She's good. - No! Stop... Why you fighting it? Come here.
