AND THERE WAS A BIT OF A WIND UP, JUST ENOUGH TO RUSTLE THE LEAVES. CAN WE MAKE THAT SOUND, RUSTLING LEAVES? COME ON. HOW DOES THAT SOUND? THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT. NOW, UNCLE JIM WAS AFRAID OF NO MAN, BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT NIGHT THAT MADE HIM UNEASY. WHEN HE CAME AROUND THE BEND, HE SAW A LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A BRIDGE HE HAD TO CROSS. AND THE CLOSER HE GOT, THE BRIGHTER THE LIGHT SHONE OUT. WHEN UNCLE JIM PUT ONE FOOT ON THAT BRIDGE, HE FROZE LIKE A PILLAR, BECAUSE THE LIGHT WAS COMING TOWARD HIM. IT WAS JUST... SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AND COMING CLOSER AND CLOSER. SO MOVED TO ONE SIDE AND THE LIGHT MOVED WITH HIM. THEN HE MOVED TO THE OTHER SIDE, AND THE LIGHT MOVED AS WELL. THEN THAT LIGHT CAME RUSHING AT HIM, AND UNCLE JIM, THE SAME UNCLE JIM WHO WAS AFRAID OF NO MAN, WAS SO SCARED THAT HE RAN OFF THE BRIDGE AND TOOK SHELTER UNDERNEATH IT.

DON'T LET ME SEE YOU AGAIN, OR I'LL HAVE YOU ARRESTED. YOU MIGHT CALL ME A STUPID IMBECILE, AND YOU MIGHT CALL ME A MORON, BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING RIGHT NOW, BRO'. THOSE BOYS HAVE A FRIEND IN ME. AND IN YOU, THEY HAVE NOTHING. YOU CAN TAKE HIM WITH YOU. POOR CHILD. BROTHER, I HAVE NO IDEA WHO DID WHAT. BUT I THINK YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SOMEBODY DOWN THERE. HE DIDN'T SAY WHO IT WAS? NO, HE WOULDN'T TELL US ANYTHING. PERHAPS YOU CAN, UH, FIND OUT MORE FROM THE BOY. BUT THE CHILD IS TERRORIZED, I'M CONVINCED. I HAD NO IDEA.

I'VE GOT NO PARKING SPACES IN THE BACK. THAT PERVERT GLACKIN'S BEEN AFTER MY BROTHER AGAIN. IF HE TOUCHES HIM AGAIN, I'M GOING TO KNOCK OUT HIS TEETH AND SHOVE THEM UP HIS HOLY ARSE. HEY, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE, YOUNG MAN. FOUL MOUTH, THREATENING A BROTHER, DISRESPECTFUL OF GOD AT MASS AND GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE. 10 OF THE BEST ON EACH, BROTHER. NO TEARS, MR. LUNNY?

YOU GO, AND YOU FIND HIM NOW! 'CAUSE I AIN'T LEAVING TILL I TALK TO THE FELLA. WELL, WE HAVE OUR PROCEDURES TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS, MR. FINN. AND THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO GO ABOUT IT. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M TELLING YOU THEY'RE BEATING THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF THEM BOYS AND GOING AROUND AT NIGHT, BOTHERING THEM IN THEIR BEDS. NOW, WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PUT A STOP TO IT? AS I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU, MR. FINN, WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING UNTIL YOU GO TO THE PROPER DISTRICT OFFICE TO FILL OUT A COMPLAINT FORM. NOW, ONCE THAT IS DONE, THE FORM WILL BE EVALUATED BY OUR REVIEW PANEL. I'M SUPPOSED TO GO AND FILL OUT A FORM? THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? WELL, YOU JUST CAN'T COME BARGING IN HERE, MAKING WILD STATEMENTS ABOUT THINGS YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN YOURSELF. SPREADING RUMOURS ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST HALLOWED INSTITUTIONS OF THIS CITY. NOW, I'M SORRY, I MUST INSIST THAT YOU FOLLOW THE RULES. THEY, THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR VERY-- MR. FINN, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I TELL YOU WHERE I'M NOT GOING. THAT'S TO YOUR DISTRICT OFFICE TO FILL OUT NO GODDAMNED FORM. NO, SIR. HA, HA, I SAID TO HER, I SAID, "LADY, WHAT ARE YOU GIVING IT TO ME FOR?" "DON'T FORGET THE SURGEON!" AH, HERE IT IS. HERE IT IS.

AH, WELL, MINISTER, THE RENOVATIONS ARE BUDGETED AT 450,000, AND THE RINK AT HALF A MILLION, SO THE TOTAL GOVERNMENT GRANT WILL HAVE TO BE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF $1 MILLION. IS THAT ALL? ST. VINCENT HAS ALWAYS HAD ONE OF THE FINEST TEAMS IN THE CITY. NOW THAT THEY'LL FINALLY HAVE THEIR OWN RINK, THEY MAY BE JUST UNBEATABLE. AND LEARN TO SKATE.

NOW, UH, THIS BOY YOU TOOK TO THE HOSPITAL, KEVIN REEVEY. WHAT WAS THE DOCTOR'S NAME? THAT'S ANOTHER THING. WHY WOULD LAVIN HAVE ME FIRED JUST FOR TAKING A YOUNG KID TO THE HOSPITAL? THE DOCTOR, MIKE? DO YOU REMEMBER HIS NAME? JESUS, I DON'T KNOW. HE THREW ME OUT OF THE ROOM, LOOKING AT ME LIKE I DONE SOMETHING. THEN THAT HIGH AND MIGHTY FELLA FROM THE GOVERNMENT ASKING ME TO FILL OUT FORMS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO READ AND WRITE TO KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG?

EVERYONE SEE IT? YES. [ P.A. ]: KEVIN REEVEY TO THE OFFICE. KEVIN REEVEY TO THE OFFICE. KEVIN REEVEY. COME ON, KEVIN, LET'S GO. HURRY UP. NOW, THIS LINE IS CALLED THE EQUATOR. IT DIVIDES THE EARTH IN HALF. THE UPPER HALF IS CALLED? THERE'S A POLICEMAN IN MY OFFICE WHO WANTS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE HOSPITAL. ANYTHING YOU TELL HIM, I WILL KNOW ABOUT IT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? KEVIN REEVEY? BRIAN? BRIAN? CAN I, UH, HAVE A TALK WITH YOU? IN PRIVATE, PLEASE. COME ON, IT'S ALL RIGHT. WHAT DID HE ASK YOU? HE TOLD ME I'M A PART OF A POLICE INVESTIGATION, AND I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL ANYONE WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT. I SAID, WHAT DID HE ASK YOU, AND WHAT DID YOU SAY? HE TOLD ME THAT IF ANYONE SO MUCH AS TOUCHES ME, TO CONTACT HIM. SO, YOU WANT TO TOUCH ME? YOU WANT TO HIT ME, HEY? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO? 'CAUSE I'M NOT TELLING YOU NOTHING! [ VOMITING ] WHAT WAS DONE TO YOU IS A CRIME, KEVIN. WHOEVER DID THAT CAN BE PUT IN JAIL. JAIL? YEAH, IF YOU TELL ME WHO DID IT. WERE YOU BEATEN BECAUSE YOU RAN AWAY FROM THE ORPHANAGE? WHO TOLD YOU I RAN AWAY? I TALKED TO THE OFFICERS WHO BROUGHT YOU BACK HERE, KEVIN. ALL RIGHT? NOW, THE LAST THING THEY SAW WAS BROTHER LAVIN TELLING YOU TO WAIT IN HIS OFFICE. THE NEXT DAY, YOU WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL. CAN I GO NOW? IT'S OK, KEVIN. JUST TAKE IT EASY, NOW, ALL RIGHT? THINGS ARE GOING TO BE OK. THANK YOU, KEVIN. RUN ALONG NOW. STRAIGHT BACK TO CLASS, NOW, KEVIN. NO DETOURS. IF I HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS, I'LL BE IN TOUCH. DETECTIVE, IF THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THESE BOYS, I THINK I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT. AS I'VE TOLD YOU, I'M FOLLOWING UP SOME LEADS. I'M AFRAID I CAN'T GO BEYOND THAT. I HOPE YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED AND THAT WILL BE THE END. I'M AFRAID I CANNOT HAVE THIS KIND OF THING GOING ON HERE. NOW, ON THAT, I AGREE WITH YOU. THIS IS NO PLACE TO CONDUCT POLICE INTERVIEWS. I'M TELLING YOU, THAT'S WHAT THE COP SAID. THEY'RE ALL GOING TO JAIL, IF, AND ONLY IF, YOU GUYS TELL THEM WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING AROUND HERE. I DON'T KNOW, BRIAN. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN THEM NAMES. CHRIST, LAVIN WILL TAKE THE SKIN RIGHT OFF OF US. CHICKEN, CHICKEN. [ CROWING ] DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK AT THAT? NO. THANK YOU. KEVIN HAD A HARD LIFE BEFORE HE CAME TO THE ORPHANAGE. HE WAS BROUGHT UP WITH ALCOHOL AND FIGHTING, AND THEN THERE WAS THE FIRE WHICH ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED THE CHILD. WATCHING HIS PARENTS BEING CARRIED OUT DEAD. NOW, THE DOCTOR WHO SAW KEVIN FILED AN OFFICIAL REPORT OF SUSPECTED ABUSE. YES, I KNOW. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT? IT'S ALREADY BEEN DEALT WITH. EVERYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH THE ORPHANAGE GETS SENT TO THE DIRECTOR. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST REPORT, YOU KNOW. REPORTS HAVING TO DO WITH BEATINGS? BEATINGS AND... THEY GO UPSTAIRS, AND THAT'S THE LAST WE EVER HEAR OF THEM. HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY REPORTS OF BROTHERS TOUCHING BOYS? THERE HAVE BEEN RUMOURS. LOOK, I'M THE SOCIAL WORKER ASSIGNED TO THE BOYS IN THE ORPHANAGE, AND I CAN'T EVEN GET IN THERE TO SEE THE BOYS. BROTHER LAVIN SAYS IT WOULD DISRUPT THEIR ROUTINE. REALLY? THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO. HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO GO OVER THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN NEWFOUNDLAND? THIS BRIAN LUNNY HAS BEEN MAKING SOME SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS, BROTHER. DO YOU KNOW OF ANYTHING GOING ON? NO. I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT. WHAT I DO BELIEVE IS HE'S A SULLEN AND RESENTFUL YOUNG DELINQUENT. WHAT IF IT IS TRUE? WHAT THEN? THEN GLACKIN WILL HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH. BUT I TELL YOU HE IS SIMPLY MAKING UP A STORY ABOUT HIS LITTLE BROTHER TO HIDE HIS OWN INCIPIENT CRIMINALITY. I DON'T THINK YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. THIS IS A COPY OF THE WITNESS STATEMENT WHICH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO SEND OVER. PETER, DO YOU REALIZE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A POLICE INVESTIGATION GETS UNDERWAY? WORD OF IT STARTS GETTING AROUND. ALL SORTS OF RUMOURS START UP. I AM GETTING CALLS. NOW THE POLICE WANT TO INTERVIEW MORE BOYS. AND NOT AT THE ORPHANAGE, YOU SEE? I WILL DEAL WITH IT. THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH, PETER. THE MONSIGNOR WILL BE LOOKING INTO THIS MATTER ON MY BEHALF. HE'LL KEEP YOU INFORMED. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S REST, PETER. I HAVE THE FEELING YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT. YOUR GRACE. PETER, PLEASE. SIT A MOMENT. I'D LIKE TO READ SOME OF THE WORDS FROM THIS... THIS BOY'S STATEMENT. "I HAVE BEEN BEATEN LOTS OF TIMES BY BROTHER GLYNN." "HE SMASHES LOTS OF BOYS," "AND HE'S AFTER SOME OF THE LITTLE ONES." "I SAW HIM RUBBING MIKE SPROULE'S PRIVATE PARTS." "BROTHER GLACKIN IS AFTER MY LITTLE BROTHER, STEVIE." EVERYBODY UP PLEASE, IMMEDIATELY! DOWN TO THE GYMNASIUM RIGHT NOW, COME ON! UP, UP, UP, COME ON! YOU, GET UP, YOU, GET UP! COME ON! DOWN TO THE GYMNASIUM, QUICKLY, PLEASE. FORGET YOUR SLIPPERS. DOWN TO THE GYM! GO, GO, COME ON! THERE ARE RUMOURS BEING SPREAD AROUND BY CERTAIN PEOPLE. ANYONE WHO IS SPREADING THESE RUMOURS IS A TRAITOR TO THE ORPHANAGE, A TRAITOR TO YOU AND A TRAITOR TO GOD. WHATEVER HAPPENS INSIDE THE WALLS OF THIS ORPHANAGE IS TO STAY INSIDE THE WALLS OF THIS ORPHANAGE. THAT IS A SACRED RULE, A RULE MORE SACRED THAN ANY RULE YOU WILL EVER HEAR. UNDERSTAND THIS. THERE ARE PEOPLE OUTSIDE WHO WANT TO SEE THIS ORPHANAGE CLOSE. THESE... THESE RUMOURS ARE THE WAY TO DO IT. IF THESE HELLISH FANTASIES ARE BELIEVED BY THE DEVILS OUTSIDE, PEOPLE WILL STOP DONATING MONEY. PEOPLE WILL STOP DONATING CLOTHING. YOU WILL BE FORCED OUT ONTO THE STREET, AND YOU WILL HAVE NOWHERE TO GO BUT INTO THE GUTTER. IF I HEAR OR HEAR OF ANYONE WHO IS SPREADING THESE EVIL LIES FROM HELL OR TALKING TO ANYONE OUTSIDE, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT BY GOD... BY GOD, THEY WILL BE PUNISHED. NOW, MIKE, WHAT ABOUT BROTHER GLYNN? HAS HE EVER TOUCHED YOU? YES. WHAT HAS HE DONE? HE TOOK ME TO MY DORM, PUT ME ON HIS KNEE AND SPANKED ME. AND THEN? AND THEN HE RUBBED ME ALL OVER AND ALL OVER MY BUM. WHAT ELSE? SOMETIMES HE EVEN DOES IT ON MY PRIVATE PART. WHAT DOES HE DO ON YOUR PRIVATE PART? HE RUBS ME. WHAT ELSE DOES HE DO? SOMETIMES HE TAKES ME INTO HIS BED AND PUTS ME ON TOP OF HIM AND SAYS RUB ME ON HIS PRIVATE PART. DOES HE DO THIS OFTEN? YES. NOW, WHAT ABOUT BROTHER MAC? NO, HE NEVER DONE ANY OF THAT STUFF.
