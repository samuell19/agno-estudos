TOE! COMPANY, LTD. Presents Kobe, 1947 You have to pay me! You brute! The International Gang of Kobe TANAKA Noboru, Director "This is a command from the GHQ office: "As General Krugar returns to his home country, "Kobe's hoarded goods will be collected at Port Kobe. "We will take them immediately. End of message." Whoa! If we load more this tire's gonna blow! Damn it. You idiot! Don't speak so loud! - He's Japanese! - An imposter! Let's go. Hurry! Why... Otaki? 'Cuz I had to. Maki, floor it! Boss, a checkpoint! With real MPs! Ram it, Maki! Roll the oil drums out! Tamotsu, now! Shoot it! We can't trust the Japanese police! Actually, that truck you asked about was "tonansha." "Tonansha"? Meaning it was stolen. We have no more solid evidence. The truck was from Kobe. And the criminals were certainly Japanese. I saw them with my own eyes! Hatsue! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm gonna kill ya! What are you doin', puttin' that on me! Hold on a minute, you wench. I'm studying. It's hot... Hey, who's this woman here? Which do you want? You want me, don't you? Damn, it's ripped. I'm exhausted. What are you talkin' about! Show more life, will ya! I'm beat. Who is it? Teru? What happened? A fight with your wife? C'mon in. I was about to kill her, and the freakin' punk, until the baby started to cry. Boss, I'm going back to my hometown, right now. Tomorrow, the money from sugar sales arrives. Why don't you wait for that? I'm leaving tonight. I apologize for my selfishness. Here, take this. I appreciate it. Hey, go heat up some milk for the baby. I've never done that. You moron... You're a woman! If you can't do it, then squeeze your own breasts. Outta the way! Boss! Boss! The Kowloon gang ain't gonna pay for the sugar! What...? Kowloon Alliance Hi, my name is Dan. What's the deal with the sugar money? Money... You losers of the war... What are you talking about! We're gettin' nowhere. Bring your boss out. Mr. Yo is not here. You guys stink... Get outta here! So, you're not gonna pay. Naa, we don't feel like paying. Get out. Not gonna pay, huh. Pochi. Look what's outside. You always go on about how you "won the war." We're gonna bum this place down! Enjoy the wan-nth. Please, hold on a sec. Boss! Get over here! Shut the hell up, you idiot! Even if the cops won't do anything, we won't be quiet. We don't get money... We don't eat! You really wanna see how tough us Kobe Yakuza are? Nice to see you, Mr. Dan. Just like you said, The Chinese Yakuza and the Japanese Yakuza are equal. It doesn't matter who won the war. It's about time you came out! Let's chat about it. We'll find common ground. You wanna stand, or sit down? Use these chairs. Forget that, peabrain. So taking other's money is what you call "business." More like robbery. Robbery? We both do that. We'll pay the money. It's a tad expensive, though. 300 grand yen is too much. How about coming down on the price? How much can you pay? 200 grand? All right. I see you have a lot of youngsters, too. Let's call it a deal at 200 grand. Man! The faces of those Kowloon punks when that gas drum flew into the room! They're just cheap laborers from China. On the other hand, my dad.. We know, we know. You're gonna tell us about how he was the top trader in Kobe since Meiji Era. We're sick of that story. It's true though. As president of Chuka Daiichi Company, he was graciously invited by Majesty the Emperor and... Hey Nogaki, stop blowin' your own horn. Maki, wipe it up. Do it yourself. What! Stop it, Otaki. You're a rude drunk. How am I rude? Boss, we brought a bunch oi homes over'! Let's go dancing! Cabaret "Tiger" Happy, let's dance. Sony, it's that time of the month. Riko, you wanna dance? Dancing is for children. Tamotsu, let's blow this joint. Hey, Mister! Whaddyu want? I gotta nice girl for you. And she's my sister. She's got big ones I'll give you a discount for three. Come on. Why'd you do that? You nitwit! If you have the guts to sell your sister, join a gang, or steal, and make your own money! Whoa, that's 200 yen! So what. Let's go! Hi, Mom. Thanks. Look... I got some sugar! I'm sure it's from doing bad things again. Get it outta here! What a waste! Nice to see you, sir. Don't pay him any money, Mom! What's your problem? Ain't none of your business. What happened? Did those Kowloon punks do this to you again? Boss... They're messing around with us again. Get ready! Let's kill 'em! Wait, wait, wait. Look, look... We surrender! Arms are raised! Don't deny that your guys injured mine. Why the hell you chargin' protection money at the black market? Protection money? That's right. From today, we're taking that over. That's gonna be a problem. You see, we found it first. Look, if you "find" money then tum it in to the police, you get some as a reward. It's common sense. No, that's nonsense! We're Kobe residents. The money you "found" was the money we "lost." So, let's split the difference. Give us half of the money. I can't give you half. Dan, you don't know Kowloon. I'd lose face with my people. Please think about that. No, you think about it! Mr. Dan is a full-blooded Japanese. If you keep on bumbling on, I'll shoot you! What should I do? I-I-I'm thinking hard. A-ha, you can be my advisor. It'd be just like a brother. Then you could take half. No way. I don't like it. Bro... That's why people say you're nanow-minded. Just shake hands, and we'll have money. Think it over, okay? Yeah. Boss. Times are tough. We're not "losing" anything. So, should we take the offer? Let's do it. OK. I'll be your advisor. Great, you'll do it? Mr. Dan, now you'll have power and money. We'll be like a two-headed dragon! Who are you? And what are you doing at my house? That was a stupid fight you got into... I did it for you! You dope? Who pays you? You've joined a damn gang! What's wrong with that? You'll starve doing honest work! Get out of here now! I ain't never coming back! And I'm taking this! What the hell you doin'? Ahh... hello sir. Maki, she looks like you when you were a kid. Well, I won't pay over 50 yen for this kimono. Nobody buys this worn-out material these days. Fifty yen, no more. You moron. What are you blabbing about? Please permit me to buy this. Why do you like that old material? Shaddup! Would this be enough? That's too much. Around 200 is plenty enough. Take it. Money doesn't go bad. I can't accept this. Please accept it from me. Thank you so very much. What the hell you doin'! If you don't fix that scar, you won't attract girls. Do you need money? Damn you! Goro, what the hell did you do? We already settled things with Kowloon, did we not? And knowing that, you still beat Ko up? I'm so very sorry. You freakin' idiot! Yo is gonna get us back for this stupidity of yours! Did you do this to put Boss in jeopardy? How you gonna pay for this? A finger or two ain't enough. Do I need to pay with my life? Die? So you're gonna kill yourself? Ha! Goro... Take full responsibility for your actions. I'll take care of it. Move over. Let me take care of it, please Bro. You can't kill anybody. Outta my way! I guess years of slicing up whales makes one devalue human life, doesn't it? What did you say? Nakao, why don't you take care of this. Climb on up here, will ya? This bombed-out place is perfect for your death. Get in! Keep going! Oops, that's the chicken Goro brought back. Food's ready. Ouch! Give me some chazuke. Someone shot this poor dog! Twice in the head. Nakao, did you... You told me to take care of him, right. Either way, it was up to me. Kill a dog... kill a person Yo, how about some rice. Miss Sakaguchi! Miss Misako! Hey, have some class! Didn't I tell you to be polite. Hi, it's nice to see you. Here's some rice, and some sugar, and some canned food. If this isn't enough, we'll go rip off some more. Ow! I don't know if I can... Please do. Oh, Misako's mother? Please feel free to use all of this food. Boss is head over heels in love with your daughter. Ouch! Sony to keep you waiting. Not at all. You're beautiful, just like this place. This is Kobe's best place to eat, er, to dine, on French food. You are always so kind. How can I thank you? You don't need to thank me. My mother appreciates your kindness, too. Really? In that case, maybe I should have invited her, too. I wonder how many years it has been since I've had a meal in such a fine place. Oh, it's rainin'. C'mon, give us a break, Boss. I wonder if they're getting along well. I wonder where that's coming from. Yes, where is it coming from? Nice song, don't you think? It sure is. Yo, buddy. Ah, it's started raining. A rainy atmosphere is nice, too, isn't it. Please don't be shy. Eat all you want. Get lots of good nutrition. Okay. You've never had a man before, have you? I'll show you what it's like. What the hell are you doing! Just be quiet, will ya! Let me go! Get your dirty hands off me! I already have a man I love! Dan, is it? He's involved with another woman. He has no feelings for you, airhead! Leave me alone! Damn it! Forget about Dan! Damn you! What are you doing? Come under here. Strange kid... Boss, Ko's been kidnapped! He was just walking around the black market and suddenly he was taken. It was those dirty Korean creeps. Yes, it was. Hey, here's Mr. Dan. Hi. Mr. Dan. Perfect timing. Ko was kidnapped by the Korean Federation. They said if we value Ko, share our "street tax." Our honor is at stake, if we do nothing. Mr. Dan, please go and bring him back. Why don't you go? They said anyone can come. Even you, Mr. Dan. Did they really say that? Yes, they did. Those guys despise you. Korean Federation Hey, here they come! Guys, get the weapons. Move, morons! You war-losers got no business here. Get out! Mr. Baku. It's been quite a while hasn't it, Mr. Dan. I'm here to bring Ko back. Even for you, Dan, that would be impossible. As president of the Korean Federation, I cannot back down on something so easily after making up my mind about it. Go ahead, kill my boss... if you dare! Mr. Dan... Today, I will let you save face. Mr. Dan. Mr. Dan, thank you. Mr. Dan. Someday, either I will kill you... or you will kill me. Gimme a curried rice. The special one, yeah. Move! I'm sittin' here. Welcome. Ohm a newbie... and cute. What are you doing! How dare you! Hey, wait! No, leave me alone! Damn you! You sex fiend! Shut up. Stop yelling. You and I are the same, right? What do you mean? I was born in Pusan. You? How'd you know? Nobody's noticed it until now. Why did you hide being Korean? Here we go! OK, bets in... bets in. How much money do you have? I have 20,000 yen. Okay, I'll go one-on-one. Gimme all your cash, guys Mr. Dan. Are you serious? C'mon, out with the cash! If you bet it all at once, and we lose, we're broke! We'll just go earn some more. Yeah, go boss, you can do it! We ready? And the winner is... MacArthur. Tough luck, Mr. Dan. See, Boss, I told you that would happen. Maybe taking a leak will help my luck. What's your problem? Damn assholes! Die, you punks! Let's get outta here! Bro! Otaki, you okay, man? Damn bastards! Shoot 'em! C'mon out! If you all can't get along, we can't keep order here in Kobe. For my sake, could you all find some agreement? Mr. Baku, what about it? How about you, Mr. Yo? Dan, I'm asking you, too, to say something. Looks like the negotiations are breaking down. Don't talk to the Police Chief like that! Shut your mouth! You all always take our bribes. Dan, why come here if you're gonna be like that! Boku, you didn't attack the Kowloon Gang only. That's what you mean, isn't it, Mr. Dan. No Visitors. Under Orders for Complete Rest. Hey, do it a little softer! I can't help it... I've got pearls sewn in Here, t-t-take this off. Please be quiet. How's that feel? How good does it feel? It's... whatever. You really move your hips, don't you. You can really feel those rolling around, can't you! Oh, yes... Happy is, happy. Ah, ow... You get on top. Baby, is your injury okay? Yeah, it's okay. How many pearls are in there? There's four. They are valuable, aaam't they...! How long will you keep him in the hospital? You're just taking our money. Shenanigans like that sure aren't helping his recovery. Doc, what are you talking about? Doc's right. When Otaki has Happy come by for a quickie, it re-opens the wound. Your hospital must control this kind of stuff! That's right! Ah, Mr. Dan. Mr. Dan. Boku's bringing men down from Osaka, too. I'll take care of it. Okay, okay, I'll tell you. So then let me go. Where is he? Answer now! At his villa in Kitamachi. OK, ease his pain. Here it is. Morimoto is the guy's Japanese name. Boss, nobody's on the second floor. Except a woman in the tub. So what! Let's make her talk! Otaki, keep your hands off women and children. Damn that Boku! Son of a bitch! He knew we were coming. We can get him anytime. Let's go. Mr. Dan, what in the world is the meaning of this? You know what my coming to your house means. I don't have to tell you why. Outside. What's are you doing! Gimme a break! What's gain' on? This guy rant away after he saw us. What do you do for Boku? My name is Kimura. I'm from the liquor store near the station. I'm just delivering some sake. Please let me go. Either way, you're comin' with us. Just let me go, please. Shut your trap! What are you doin'? Move your ass! I heard you. Aren't you ashamed that you've become a pit bull for the Japanese? You're a disgrace to our country. You sewer rat! Shut your trap! You're so jittery you probably missed him. Hold on, you! Where do you think you're going? You didn't see anything, right. Yes, yes sir. You're being too soft on him! Stop it, Otaki! He saw our faces! What the hell are you talking about! You damn idiot! It's only because of us that you can be the don! Who the hell are you pointing your gun at? Go ahead... Just try shooting my brother. Let's stop this. You idiots! This is not the time for infighting. Follow me! When we questioned Boku's villa's neighbors, your names came up. I appreciate the information. You guys did it, right? How about this: If you inform on Dan, he'll take the blame himself. We'll let you other guys off the hook. Dan, please come with us. What about? About Boku's murder. We got evidence. Hurry up! Go ahead, you bastards! Just try and get me! Korean Federation's Leader Boku's Murder: Masato Dan - claims he alone committed the crime. Any reaction to your 20-year sentence? I doubt if I can live on the dole for 20 years. You can't make money without power, right. I've always made a living on my own. Are you going to appeal? Or else... Go ahead and write whatever you want. We children are starving. Dan appealed immediately. He was released on bail two months later. Welcome back! Good to see you, brother. Mr. Dan, thank you so much for all you've done. I should thank you, for posting my bail. No, it was the right thing to do. We Chinese have a strict moral code. We don't forget feelings of gratitude. Boss, have some beer. Thank you for the hardships that you endured alone. Forget about it. It was someone here who betrayed me. In due time, I'll find out. Then I'll kill him. So, how strong is the Korean Federation now? Mr. Dan, don't worry about it. After Boku was killed, they all lost their edge. Lee became their leader. He's no good, has no class. Boss. Good to see you. Maruyama, you son of gun! Boss, congratulations on your release. Thanks. How's your child? Died from illness. Boss, I'd like to rejoin the family. Let's have a drink. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'll pack, then come right back. Thank you, thank you. We're waiting for you, Bro. For sure, for sure! Man, he's lookin' pretty thin. Otaki! What's going on? Whaddyu think I'm doin'! I'm educating this new guy. He greets you, but not me. What's up with that? This lamebrain hates me 'cuz you look down on me. Otaki! Up until today, I've put up with your arrogance. What, you wanna fight! Bring it on! Boss! Brother! Nobody get involved. Boss, wait a minute. Here... will this pay for it? No words are needed. I didn't realize my oversight. Please forgive me! Otaki. Considering his finger, I'll overlook this today. Go wherever the hell you want. Dan was sentenced to 18 years at Kakogawa Prison Six months later They're all great guys! Joining a gang was my childhood dream. Why was that? I can get back at the kids who teased me. You know, my papa worked in a coal mine in Kyushu. He was made the boss of a group of forced laborers. Soon after losing the war, he was accused of being a spy for Japan, and was beaten to death by his own countrymen. I'm a Japanese person, who was born and raised in Japan. What's this? This is... I don't know why, but this is the first time for me to save money. Why are you giving me this important money? If I keep it, I'll spend it. You hang on to it for now. Well, maybe I'll spend it. That's fine with me. I gotta go. Say grace. Word is that Pochi has checked into the infirmary. Hey, guards! Watch me carefully! You made it. I didn't eat on purpose to get in here. How'd you do it? Pretended I was crazy. Oh, this is for you. Excellent. How'd you get it in here? It was in, uh, a stinky place. I wanted to tell you... How's Misako doing? We're still bringing her all kinds of stuff. Hey, Boss. It was Mr. Otaki who ratted you out. That's complete nonsense. Even Otaki wouldn't do anything that cowardly. I'm certain that it's true. There's no way Nakao would get that information wrong. I'm breakin' outta here. What about you, guys? C'mon Pochi! Please don't shoot! Masa! Boss! Get in, get in! Pochi! Tie a tourniquet on that. Okay. Where's Otaki? Nakao is looking for him. Let's go, Maki! Go, Maki! I'm so sorry to bother you so suddenly, Ms. Misako. But could you help us for just one night? We will not inconvenience you in the least. Hang on, Pochi! It's because of you that our plan succeeded. Goro, go find a doctor. We are truly sorry for the inconvenience. Don't mention it. You all are probably hungry... I'll make some... We have canned food in the car. I'll go get it. Well, how about some tea? Thank you so much. Who the hell were you calling? A friend of mine. You liar. You called the police, didn't you! Damn you! You bitch! Wait! What in the hell are you doing? Masa, she called the cops. I heard her! You idiot. Ms. Misako would never do that. Apologize to her! But, Masa, it was the cops. I'm certain I heard her! Boss, hurry! Let's go. Pochi... Pochi, hang in there. I am... not Pochi. Please don't bury me without a name. My real name is... Yoko. Pochi, Pochi... Pochi... There's no methanol in this, is there? Of course not! Hey, you've become quite a hottie... Do you have a nice boyfriend? You're just flattering me. Your ass is gettin' nice and big. Hey, touching is expensive! People seem to be saying that Dan was arrested because I betrayed him. I heard that rumor, too. Aha! That's why that punk Nakao is looking for us. Why the hell would I do something so low! Why would I? I thought of working with him again, but suddenly... I guess we'll just fight it out. Otaki, Bro... What? I'm the one who ratted Dan out. The detective Nishimiura tricked me. I couldn't stand Boss' attitude towards you. And then I just blurted it out. You stupid punk! Please forgive me. Forgiveness! What the hell are you talking about! C'mon, Bro. Go to hell! Where's Otaki? Hey! What are you doing? You, get the gun! It's in the ceiling. You stupid klutz! He's coming to kill us. Let's get outta here! Damn it all! No Masa yet? His talk with Nakao is still dragging on. That Otaki! I just wanna beat him to a pulp! Oh, Big Bro! They're planning to load it offshore by speedboat. So, the both of you are in this dirty business, too. The diamonds were gotten from rich Japanese. We don't want those punks making off with them. Even if the police confiscate them alt, we can't do anything with them. It's regrettable for them, but we make money. One-third is a lot. I want 50%. You're crazy! Didn't we agree on us three splitting it evenly. Hey I'm the one taking the risk. I want 50%. Dan is after you, isn't he. One word from me and... And whose fault is it that he's after me, jerk! You schemed it all. Otaki, X can arrest you fight now 'ti 1 wank m. Just try it! I'd spill the beans about everything. Okay, okay, let's make it 50%. Can you pony up some cash for Dan's getaway? His getaway? That will be a problem. I don't feel like bothering with an escaped convict. His bail cost me a lot of money, didn't it. Where's Mr. Dan now? You think I'm gonna tell you? If thought of as overdue advisor's fee, it's cheap. Pay what you owe. Here you go. You talk about Kowloon's strong moral code, then you all act like this. What! Get him! You see, I also killed lots of people in the war. You Asian devil! Where's Otaki? I don't know, I don't know! Nogaki. You still don't know? Talk now! Where's Otaki? Spit it out, you idiot! He'll be, at three tomorrow, at Meriken Pier. The Menken Pier? To steal the diamonds... You're certain about that? He's dying. Masa, must you do this? This time it's more dangerous than ever. Let's leave all of this, the two of us... I can make enough to... You numskull. What are you talking about? You'd even sell your body for food? We've both been in and out of reform school. We've already suffered too much, haven't we. You think I'd make you sell your body? After becoming a Yakuza, one doesn't up and quit. That Otaki kills anyone in his path. So, we're gonna get the GI's diamonds. Let's go to Hong Kong after that. We all run away to Hong Kong, and control a black market territory over there. Whaddyu think, Maki? Guys, if this job pays off, let's head to Hong Kong. We can't stay here forever. Yea! Overseas! A foreign country! Nogaki, start seriously studying Chinese. If this job works out, we're in the money! I'm so excited about it! What would you do with your share? Heck, I'd buy my granddad's old house, and hire ten maidens who call me Our Mighty Warrior. Nogaki, throw the grenade. Nogaki, grab him. How do you look now! Move it, move it! Otaki's here! That scumbag! Get in, everybody! Otaki, how dare you sell me out to the police! What about it! Let's shoot it out! You're tryin' to grab our diamonds! Goro, go with Nakao. Okay. Go! Boss. Damn. You son of a bitch! Dan Otaki, come out! You are surrounded! Stop this useless fighting and come out now! Dan, Otaki, come out! You are surrounded! Stop this senseless shooting and come out now! Chief. It doesn't matter. Do what we need to do! That damn Nishimura is double-crossing us again! Goro! Dan, what's goin' on? C'mon! Damn it all! Let's kill that punk Otaki! Hey, Bro! You bastard! Boss, cover me, will ya. Bro! Die! Get out here! C'mon! This is all your damned fault. Stop whining! We've gotta charge now! Tamotsu! Otaki, let's get this over with. Shove it! Oh, Masa! Dan, Otaki, c' men out! If you don't, we'll open fire again!
