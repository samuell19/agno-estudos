1000 years ago, there was a king, who ruled a part of the Europe continent During wars, the enemies heads were chopped off... The soldiers enjoyed playing with those heads by kicking them around The king who, noticed this, then declared it an official game The soldiers played that game with an out of shape ball The played with no rules and brutally attacked each other while playing the game Years passed by and later that game was addressed as Mob football Later the Mob football turned into a gambling and betting game The king saw this and banned it Years passed by... Many successors ruled as king and they too never revoked the ban on Mob football However the game started gaining attention worldwide The game was played under many names, each being differentiated based on the rules of play Out of those, football earned a good recognition It was further categorized as 'Elevens', where each teams had 11 players... and as 'Sevens' where each team had 7 players in it 'Sevens' is played with strict rules in many parts of the world But in few places, like the banned Mob football... it is still played very rough without strict rules and involved gambling Many good players have broke their arms and limbs... as result ruining their career and dreams Such a story about 'Sevens' football is what we are going to witness now "Don't you try to scare us" "Try it and you'll see chaos" "Don't you try to scare us" "So don't mess with us" "Get out there and showing off our skills" "We are invincibles!" "Score a goal with a Corner shot" "We are the expendables!" "Head the football and make a pass" "Now, that's how we show off!" "Try stopping us" "We are unstoppable!" So, come on! Come on! "Torn boots! Not a problem! We know to fix it" "Our style is swag once we set foot on the ground after the toss" "We call ourselves Neymars and Messis" "That's when emotions run high in us" "We let the opponent play and then overtake them" "And then we make them gasp for their breath and win" "We know how to mind our tongues" "We don't care about the riches. We stay humble at heart!" Come on "We'll show our mettle the whistle blows" "Our game will make you envy us" "We will rock!" Guys! The coach is here! Let go of me! Save yourselves!

Listen... Hello and greetings to one and all! On the commentary seat, for this match of a tournament that's being held after 10 years... is myself, 'Galatta' Guru and Thangadurai St.Thomas mount football association presents... 33rd District level Sevens football competition Taking place after 10 years with "Waka-waka" celebrations It's time for this extravaganza to begin! Dheena welcomes the chief guest, who is the our football committee member, Naren sir On behalf of all the football players and us, we welcome you all Whom are you betting on? Santha, Rs. 100 First match between St. Thomas Mount and Mogappair is underway Our boys are rocking! And it's a goal! - Any luck? - No, switched off Forget it, if he isn't coming That doofus! The match will start in sometime Quiet, they are boys from Puliyanthope Puliyanthope! Our locality! "Right under the Tamarind tree! Along with Pushpalatha, where I could be me!" Damn with his rhymes!

Jada, now that he is here, what's with the long face? - Here you go - Hold on Drink water - Raj, there's a bubblegum stuck your shoe! - Arvind! Here! What is it? Why did you call him? I'll tell you What's up? You guys look confused Wondering how do we place the ball and play Sevens against them. It's confusing Huddle up! Relax This isn't your usual Eleven player game This is Sevens This Sevens is an ugly side of the soccer game One who picks the ball isn't targeted The one who possess the ball... He is the target First, play in the position you're given Keep playing man to man with opponents At the same time, don't advance on the across They'll hit with their elbows Important, don't play lose with the ball If you play lose, they'll snatch the ball and also break your feet! Hold on! One at a time! Take turns and strike among yourselves That will confuse them on whom to target The most important point... No matter how good you play... They'll still play rough with you 10 minutes is all you got, guys Use the time properly You don't have to risk your life to prove you're a good player The voice of the whole crowd... depends on that one shot you'll play That one shot you'll play... must be remembered forever!

Let's see who qualifies for the semi finals The first team is Senneri Kuppam team They go against the Sathankulam Team Note that guy in blue tee Who is your money on? I think Sathankulam team because every player looks like a Satan! Muruga pass it to Palani! This side! How dare you? Please listen! Stop fighting! Why is everyone giving an opinion? You just banned us from conducting the tournament in the city limits! Come on! You say it like I'm the one who passed the order It's an order from the Commissioner's office Now that you've delivered the message, leave! Dheena... warned you the other day when you were sticking bills You ignored it Now look Your tournament cannot be played within city limits And I'll ensure it! See you! Then where do we conduct the semi finals and finals? What kind of question is that? We'll conduct it in our locality! Won't workout. Let's host it at Puzhal But Puzhal is now within city limits Then where do we conduct the tournament? Why not in Sethu's native? This is the 10th death anniversary of Sethu All of you know, what a player Sethu was If none of you have any objection, then let's conduct semi finals and finals... at Sethu's native. That's my opinion Sounds like a good idea No way! Traveling that far is out of question! It's a good idea, Dheena In two days we must conduct semi finals and finals. Where else can we conduct it? Or else you suggest a place Well, good! Dheena has accepted Let's conduct the rest of the tournament in Sethu's native - Let the arrangements begin - Fine, let's do it Take care, guys Win or lose! Play carefully, without getting hurt It was so happy to see you play! Forget about me You must have seen the happiness on your father's face The other day I slapped you I'm sorry Express as you wish, Anto I understand you I love football I wish to become a successful player No matter how much my dad trained me... I couldn't play in league matches Because I'm... hearing impaired... and speech impaired Hence, none of the teams selected me I couldn't even get a job It was in that frustration and anger, I use to drink I abuse and pick fight with everyone But... I love my father a lot. He's my life It's been a long time since he spoke to me I started hating myself You're an excellent player, Anto Quit drinking hereafter You think about only yourself... Have you ever spared a thought for your dad? Imagine the hardships he would've gone through to make you such a good player Coach, you train us from dawn till dusk... Now spare us some money.

Forget it. I'll take Blackie along and eat outside somewhere Sorry, dear. Only today I'm a bit late in serving food, right? Take that dog and leave it outside Greetings I hear that you are running back and forth from home to police station? Sir, I don't know who you are Whatever the matter is, this is not the time to discuss. Please leave I hear you're going to press charges It's of no use Let me tell you what happened My only son, Ram... He is everything to me But for him? Football is everything It was for him I once became a football board member He tried his best to get selected in the national team Even I tried to get him in the national team You have no idea how much I pleaded to your husband I'm a football committee board member What else does my son require to get qualified? Instead of picking him in the team... your husband selected a cobbler's son and let him play for the national side Because of that my son isn't alive anymore and I have no one now! Using the game which he snatched away my son forever... I used the same game... and murdered your husband! Everybody believes that your husband died because the ball hit him on his chest No! I poisoned some glucose I murdered him I buried the truth from everyone - Maari... - Mom... Mom...Mom! Mom, what's happening? Mom! Mom! Mom, what happened? Mom, please get up! What's going on? Mom, get up! Mom! Mommy! What happened? Mom, what happened? Please, get up! Uncle, please! My mom is an innocent I did everything correctly but forgot you!

Referee is started blow the whistle Don't leave Give the ball to Messi He played well Come on! Play forward! Come on! Wait and watch how the home team scores a goal now Hey! Here Pass it! Super Yes, just like that Goal! Only two minutes left, right? - Boss, are you leaving? - No. You sit down Pass! Pass! Yes! Yes! Come on flap your gums now! A team that was trained by Sethu anna once upon a time! They won't leave without the trophy! We are winning this one! - Your boys did an awesome job - Thank you! Thank you! No! Please, no! Spare my life Please, no People like you always say that people like us must not dream beyond limits Sethu anna was the one who broke that and taught us we can achieve more! And you... Your son was at fault but what was the fault of that child and her mother? You guys think money can achieve you anything? If only money can get you selected in teams, then why... do you have selections and conduct such matches? I feel like crushing you... Do you have any idea how much we struggle to even play in trials match? The boys who play in local clubs... Any idea where they come from? Any idea what their parents do? Have you ever thought about it? At least one day? Try finding it out 'My father is a cobbler on the roadside' 'I am the son of a sewage cleaner' 'My mother is a flower vendor' Crossing all the hardships We still continue to dream that at least one day we'll make it to the national team But people like you? Just walk in, throw money, achieve everything and walk off. Isn't it? This is why the Indian team... is still 'just a team' Search for good players in the team and... you'll find national level players driving load vehicles... and auto rickshaws It is because of people like you, instead of playing Elevens professionally... we play Sevens and hurt ourselves just for money! Some even lose their career! You! What do you know about our struggles? You must be... By murdering people like you, we'll only be spoiling our lives Get lost!
