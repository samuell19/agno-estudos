Charlotte Has Fun White lace... I don't believe this! It shouldn't be that hard to find a black bustier with pink lace. Charlotte, we've checked three floors now. I'm getting sick of this. Does it have to be black with pink lace? Check this out, girls! Gross! Why didn't we just go to La Senza? If you have to wear this stuff to turn on your boyfriend, somethings not right. I don't have to. It's a bonus! It's ridiculous! No, it's not. I love him and I want to make him happy. Know how you can tell if something is ridiculous? How? Imagine a monkey doing it. What? Just imagine a female monkey wearing a bustier to turn on a male. It's ridiculous! In that case, everything's ridiculous! If you imagine a monkey collecting stamps or marinating steak or whatever, that's ridiculous too. Yep! Most monkeys are vegetarians. Imagine a monkey putting ketchup on its fries then. It's ridiculous! You're right. I'll stop using ketchup. You'll get it when you fall in love. I won't fall in love. I think I found it. That's a costume! What's wrong with that? It's different in the video. Show us the video then! There are a billion videos online! You won't find it again. Very nice! Check it out. It's Princess Leia! Two Bald Men and One Shaved Woman on YouPorn. Here. You made a list of porn videos? Yeah, to find out what Samuel likes. It kind of digs in here. But it makes my boobs look good. It's not exactly like the one in the video, but... What video? Never mind. Just like that! That's it! That's it! What's wrong? You OK? It's not working. I'm sorry. You lasted longer than last time! Intimacy is what counts. We have to talk. I always knew he was gay. How could you have known that? There was no way we could have known. Nope! Besides, you think everyone's gay. No! I don't think the guy at the convenience store is gay. The guy who talked to our Grade 8 class about drugs definitely wasn't gay. - That was three years ago! - It was two years ago. That was Grade 9, not Grade 8. Samuel and I had just started dating. I don't think your dads gay. No, but he thinks you are. I don't care if Sam's gay. I'll just get a penis and we'll get back together. You can't get a penis unless you're already a guy in your head. They make you take psychological tests. Anyway, he wants to be with a guy, not a girl with a penis. The whole thing is crazy ! You know what's crazy? That you want to be with a gay guy so badly. Good point. Samuel isn't exactly the most masculine guy in the world. He's a super smart guy who could work in biotech or something. He dresses well, likes Tarantino films and has a car! That's not masculine to you? He was perfect! Charlotte! Stop listening to that depressing music! Charlotte! Leave her alone. It makes her feel better. It makes me feel better. How can you not know you're sleeping with a gay guy? Do you think he asked her to do weird stuff, like wear a fake beard? Oh my God! You guys are so immature! I feel like I would have known. Yeah, except you're a virgin! What? I lost it before you did! Is that so? And when exactly did you lose your virginity? A year ago this summer. And you didn't text or call or anything? I didn't have service at my cousin's cottage. Sleeping with your cousin doesn't count. Shut up! It wasn't my cousin. It was a guy, OK? A guy. You sure about that? Charlotte, can we eat? There's never any food here. And we're almost out of dressing! I call shotgun! I was holding it. Did you call it? I was holding it! Shotgun on the croutons! How much were we missing? Thanks, Jonathan! You're so sweet! Check this out. I found this on YouTube. She's incredible! - Yeah. Listen. - Who is she? Maria something. Just listen to her sing. She's so cool! Her voice is amazing! I told you! He's crazy about me. I think you scare him. I don't think so. Why? Ever since you told him you had a wet dream about him, he's gone silent. You may not be a virgin anymore, but you're not the only one. Yeah. A lot of people aren't virgins. A lot of people, but not you Mo. We're not virgins! You're a virgin in that you have no proof. And you're a virgin in that you've never slept with a straight guy. I know you think being gay is a big deal, but gay or straight, Samuel's an incredible, sensitive guy. Can you please watch how you talk about him? He's my soulmate, and I'll always love him. Fuck you, Samuel! Fuck you and your worthless “I love you's!" Fuck love! Fuck you! Go ahead and screw guys, You big homo! Give me my phone! I want to talk to him! - I want to tell him I love him! - He knows. - He doesn't know it enough. - Yes, he does. It's over, Charlo. But I love him! Hurry up! I'm almost done. I don't get why you absolutely have to wipe after you pee. Just find me a leaf or a flyer or something. Got it! What is it? Your Majesty. It's a May West wrapper! It's plastic! You expect me to wipe with a May West? Just shake it off! That'll dry you! Air it out! I'm gonna pee too. I'm gonna pee my pants! Come on! Find me something. Oh, shit! The cops! Guys! What are you doing? It's OK. Let it out. Yeah. But look at all this crap. They brainwash us from birth to like pink, flowers and love. That's why you're crying. Girls like that stuff. I don't. You played with Barbies when you were a kid too. Yeah, and I had to detox after. Oh yeah? How? I don't know, by becoming myself: impossible to manipulate, always real, never in love. Sounds like a slogan. Sounds like you're trying too hard. Well, guess what? Sometimes, you have to try in life. Honestly, if you were more like me, we wouldn't waste so much time talking about your love lives. It's OK! But sometimes, you gotta cut out the drama and just... - Yo, Francis! - Thanks, man! Excuse me. ...just sleep with straight guys. These are the application forms. We'll give you a call if a job opens up. Charlotte Saint-Pierre? This is Léa from Toy Depot. You'll be working evenings and weekends this fall. You'll start with 10 hours a week. That'll increase until Christmas. And then that's it. Since you're in training, you'll work with a regular employee for your first two shifts. The staff orientation was at 9:00 am. downstairs. I'm sorry. Mégane? Is that your name? Yep! - Everything all right? - Absolutely! OK. I'll go get your aprons. Are you in college? Grade 11. I'm almost done college. OK, cool! Next to the tea cups. We're allowed to talk, you know. I know. I'm not trying to flirt with you, if-- Huh? I know! Good! I've noticed that pretty girls often act cold to avoid being hassled. But by saying that, you're flirting with me. No. Yes! You just said I was pretty. But I didn't say I thought you were pretty. You're pretty. You know it. Everyone knows it. It's no secret. If I was going to flirt with you, I'd need a little more than pretty. I'm done with pretty girls, anyway. It's too complicated. So we can talk. You don't have to worry. So what do you want to talk about? - Then you press “total.” - I already did. Tell the client the amount. - $34.50. - I'll pay cash. - Press “cash.” - I'm pressing “cash.” - You take the money. - I'm taking your money. - You get their change. - The change... - Don't forget the receipt. - No, can't forget that! - And say “thank you." - Thanks. Thanks! Can I go to the bathroom? You've only been working for an hour. I'm nervous. Hello! This is a peg. This is a peg board. You have to put all the pegs on the peg board. OK! I'll put the pegs on the peg board. Then you put the merchandise on the 'pegs. [fill] put the merchandise on the pegs. - Got it? - Yep! It's our first day! So yeah, I'm heartbroken! But it's crazy that we can't be together just because one of us is gay. Hang on! His sexual orientation isn't just a detail. We're talking about love. Love comes before sexuality. Fine, but desire and love go together. You can't separate them Why not? People have sex without being in love. I know, but... Honestly, I think sex is overrated That's because you had a bad experience. I had a great experience. Samuel and I are in love. Come on! You really think it's a good idea to be super productive on our first day? It's better to build gradually. Otherwise, they'll just exploit you. - Hey, guys! - Hey, girls! Dumb-ass. When I was 16, I thought I had found my soulmate too. Now I'm 19, and I know I haven't found her yet. Yeah, but everyone says I'm an old soul. People have told me that too. But girls are five years more mature than boys. So, thanks for the advice, but I'm more mature than you. I'm serious. So, how old is your soul? It's hard to say exactly. In terms of maturity, I feel more like I'm 20, not 17. So we're the same age. More like 22, actually. You're too old for me then! Too old and too pretty! This isn't going well! Not at all! New girls getting high, huh? There's not much else to do here. - Grade 11? - Yeah. - You go to Carrefour? - Yeah. Noémie and I went there. The guys here are nothing like high school boys. They're super chill. - Except for Oli. - Yeah. Olivier's weird. He's, like, an intellectual or something. But seriously, the people here are cool. And thank God! The Christmas rush is intense! The store will become your life. - But there are good parties. - Yeah, that's true. Halloween is the big one. We all get dressed up. It's crazy! And the guys are so much fun! Do you have a boyfriend? Just one? No! We're way too free for that! The guys at Toy Depot are awesome. You can't have just one boyfriend. Love Love Love Love Love is like a bohemian child He's never, never known any law If you don't love me. then I love you And if I love you. you'd best watch out If you don't love me If you don't love me. then I love you Charlotte! You ready? You're training with me today. Coming. How's your training going? Good, I think. You need to find ways to have fun. After three years here, I still have fun. Oh yeah? I set challenges for myself and try to break my own records. Like What? I once put the 3D puzzle section together in one day by myself. It usually takes two guys two days. There's the stuffed animal section that everyone hates because no matter how hard you try, it always looks messy. Well, I think it's cute. It's a challenge. It's organized chaos, and it's fluffy. Can you hand me that one up there? Where's the ladder? You don't need a ladder. We can figure it out. - Ready? - What? Three, two, one... OK, got it! Thanks! - Hey! - Your apron's undone. Stay on my right - What? - My right. That's chivalry. If we ever walked down the street, I'd be protecting you from cars. Of course, we wouldn't need to walk. I have a car. Lovely Léa! The big day's coming up, huh? - In two and a half months. - Keep it up! I'm not the father. I didn't say anything. She always looks at me with those big doe eyes, but I'm not the father. Have you ever slept together? Before she got pregnant, she had a wicked body! I'm just joking. Actually, I'm not. We slept together, but I'm not the father. Francis? Have you seen Francis? Na. This is for you. Oh. Thanks. - You OK? - Yeah, it's just Francis. Come on! Charlotte, your apron! Thanks for the ride. No problem. I have to tell you something. I think you're cute. And since you're in my car... I know you're going through a breakup, so I don't wanna push. - Wait! - Sorry! I'll just park the car. It won't take long. In the car? Just like that? Yep. I came more than I ever did with Samuel. I'm not surprised. I felt emotions with Sam. Now I'm having orgasms. I still can't get over it. Right there in the car! He was all over me. This is just a rebound. Don't fall in love. I know. Don't worry. You need time. You said to have sex with straight guys. Yes, but don't fall in love. Exactly. Sleep with straight guys. Fall in love with gay guys. You have to get over your emotional dependence. I'm not emotionally dependent. You've never been on your own. What? I've only had one boyfriend. And when he spent a month at his uncle's out east, you started crushing on your neighbour. OK, I'm emotionally dependent. But I'm not in love with Francis, OK? Here are your sections for today. No thanks. Francis and Valérie are in board games. Charlotte, you're in sports. Antoine, returns. Olivier, you're in video games with Noémie. Guillaume and Philippe, music. Mégane, Emilie and Big Seb, central aisle and stuffed animals. What about me? The baby section. Hi, Charlotte! Hi! A little straighter, though. - Like this? - Yeah. We'll do the Lego next. OK, great! You have to do something about your apron. This is unacceptable. Sorry about the other day. I didn't take your breakup seriously. That's all right. I'm getting over one myself, so I get it. I'm sorry. It's fine. I just wanted you to know. You really like sex, don't you? Huh? No, sorry. No, I didn't mean... Actually, it's cool. It's very cool. Then he said: “You really like sex, don't you? “You're really comfortable in your skin.” In my head, I was like: "Shut up!" I was really upset. I was like: “Am I a slut in a bad way?” I'm not. You're a slut in a good way. Right. Then we made out for a long time. You know when a guy touches you and you don't like it at first, but you go with it until it becomes fun? This was fun from start to finish. What's going on with Francis? We're friends. You slept with him less than a week ago. I'm trying to be free, not emotionally dependent. Virgins like you wouldn't understand. How come you guys got paid, and I didn't? You must have. They do all the deposits-at once. I don't see it. There's a deposit right there. $130? That's from my grandma or something. No, that's it. - Are you kidding me? - We worked 15 hours. Are you fucking serious? $130 for 15 hours of-my life? That's ridiculous! Think of all the stuff I could've done in 15 hours! I could have meditated. Reread all my Tintin books. Invented a new political system combining Che Guevara and Gandhi. I could have written my autobiography. Or made a long list of all the things I cant do with $130. 'Cause it's a lot of things. A whole lot of things! How much is this? $20 or something? It's free. Shes just joking. That's what happens when you don't pay people enough. Look at South America. They don't pay the police well. So what do they do? They make money working for drug cartels. That's what they do. Give me one good reason why we shouldn't start giving everything away $64.20. Right. It's the same everywhere. Corporations hide in tax havens, while we're here, like idiots, running their business as if it was our pride and joy for 10 fucking dollars an hour! What's stopping us from getting all the stores together and taking everything? What's stopping us? Nothing. Nothing! Don't worry. She wouldn't do that. They're taking a big risk with these $10-an-hour jobs. Have a nice day! Hello! Jesus, Charlotte! It spilled everywhere! What happened to the bag? Couldn't lift it? I don't know. I wasn't concentrating. This is disgusting! Go wash your hands. I'll deal with the rest. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... - Sorry. - Sorry that took so long. - You look hot! Is the hair band too intense? Yeah, man, the hair band is intense. Intense is good! It's a big party, and she said to get dressed up. Will there be a costume contest? - Listen to her! A contest... - There could be! So, will you admit you dressed up for a guy? - No! - Who is it? There's no guy! Halloween is when the good girls get their revenge. You all dress like sluts! I'm Wonder Woman! It's not my fault Wonder Woman dresses like a slut! - So, who's the guy? - Nobody. I think I'm ready to be in a relationship. I've had my rebounds, and now I'm ready to settle down. With who? No one in particular. Guillaume, maybe. Guillaume? Yeah. He's nice and we have really deep conversations. I thought he was in the friend zone! So you're in the friend zone? No one is in the friend zone. You talk about your exes. So what? You farted in front of him in the book aisle. That was an accident! He's in the friend zone! Isn't he into Emilie anyway? - Why do you say that? - I don't know. Isn't Noémie into him? Everyone flirts with everyone. It doesn't mean anything. Che Guevara, nice! Of course. Wow! You girls went all out! You said to get dressed up. Yeah, but we're not kids anymore. I meant in a conceptual way, not full-on costumes. Why are you all wearing sunglasses? We're a disco ball. It's a group costume. Cool, huh? Check it out. Me and Guillaume have the same costume. How do we look? Wanna go to my place? You scared me. It's just a wig. Hi! Hi! Nice costume. You look good. Check it out! I'm Mr. Freeze. We've known each other for one month today. Oh yeah? That means you've been single for a month. I hadn't thought about that. So it wouldn't be wrong... if I started flirting with you. We'd been at the border for hours, and we knew we'd get searched. We were three smelly dudes coming back from Lake Placid. - We looked like hippies. - It was a hiking trip. We knew they'd search us. So I said to the guys: “Would it be crazy to smoke a joint while we wait?” - And then-- - He didn't know what he was saying. No, I wasn't thinking. He looks at us dead serious and says: “I have an emergency joint in the glove compartment.” - A what? - An emergency joint. An emergency joint. Let's say I need a joint, well, there's always one in my glove compartment. You want to study law? I'm not sure. But it'd be fun to argue against each other. You'd be the union leader and I'd represent the government. Really? You'd represent the government? Yeah. Just for the fun of fighting against you. - The worst part is you'd win. - For sure. I'm the best. That's true. But I'd be good too. You'd have to get me somehow. Hang on. I just need to get my coat. - We're in here. - Wait. Sorry. It's Guillaume's turn? I just need my coat. High five for your perfect score - What? - Nice! - My what? - Charlotte, never mind. What do you mean by “perfect score”? You know... - You didn't do it on purpose? - What? You have a perfect score. You've slept with everyone. Jesus! Everyone? Love is a rebellious bird That no one can tame And if you call for it, It'll be quite in vain For it's in its nature to say no Nothing helps, neither a threat nor a prayer For it's in its nature to say no One talks well, and the other rests silent And it's the other one that I prefer Love Love Love Love Love is like a bohemian child He's never, never known any law If you don't love me, then I love you And if I love you, you'd best watch out If you don't love me If you don't love me, then I love you And if I love you And if I love you You'd best watch out Charlotte, wait! Antoine... Charlotte, wait! What? What do you have to say? Did you think I was trying to set some kind of record too? No, I didn't know. That's why you wanted to sleep with me. No! I knew you'd slept with a couple of guys. But just the obvious ones. The obvious ones? No one saw me kiss anyone. No one walked in on me. Yeah, but guys talk. So you knew. Yes, I knew. I thought it was funny. I figured they were rebounds. A lot of rebounds. I thought we were all having fun. Well, yeah! They were talking behind my back. The guys were just happy. Of course they were! Look, I get it. I know it's weird, but it's not the end of the world. - Come back to the party. - No. OK, I'll hang out with you. What do you want to do? It's not as bad as you think. Charlotte, I swear, I don't care what happened. That's how much I like you. How much you like me? That was a joke. Wow! I'm a slut, but you don't care. That's not what I meant and you know it. All I'm saying is that guys can be possessive. But I'm not like that. I don't care. That's all. I'm leaving. You always choose weird guys. I don't like Olivier. You should have seen your face back there. I didn't make a face. Yes, you did! And now you're sulking. I'm not sulking. It's OK. You can tell me. I don't have a crush on anyone, OK? Drop it. Look at Emilie and Noémie. They're all like: “We're chill. The guys are chill. “We don't need commitment.” They just don't want to scare the guys, but they want love. And they're pissed off that Gendron and Antoine won't commit. They're just waiting around like idiots. Hang on, Emilie and Noémie are with Gendron and Antoine? Well, not officially. It's not as bad as you think, OK? No one cares who you sleep with. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Facebook... They're not like that. No one's gonna write on your wall. Stop it! Give me your phone. You'd best watch out If you don't love me If you don't love me A fundraiser for Movember? - Seriously? - What? It's so narcissistic! It's for a good cause. No, you just want a moustache but won't own it. Narcissist! It's for a good cause! If working for pharmaceutical companies is a good cause. Quit knocking it! We're doing volunteer work. Yeah, volunteer work for an industry that'll soon be more profitable than oil. They're just moustaches. Suppose that, thanks to your moustaches, they find a cure for prostate cancer. Who's gonna profit from that? Pharmaceutical companies. And they don't even have to invest in research because with your little moustaches, you tools are raising money for a billion-dollar industry. It's too bad, Mégane. You're super cute, but with that attitude, there's nothing going on down here. That's my own system of natural selection. - It works really well. - No shit! Hi, Charlotte! - Hey! I'm sorry. I didn't know you guys were seeing Gendron and Antoine. It's fine. Thanks. But if this was Iraq, you'd get stoned for sure. And if everyone here gets herpes, we'll know where it came from. And it sucks for you, 'cause when it's time to settle down, guys don't really want wild girls Think about your future husband. He's gonna ask how many guys you've been with. Yep. They all want to know. That'll be awkward. Charlotte. please report to checkout. Why'd you call me up? There's no one here. I have to take a piss. What are you doing? -. Check it out. I'm doing my own fundraiser. “Bushes for Amnesty International"? I have to take on Movember. And your receipt. Thanks far shopping at Toy Depot! Charlotte, can I talk to you for a second? REGISTER CLOSED - Have you seen Charlotte? - She's back there. I'm never having sex again. Your hymen won't grow back, you know. And it won't change the fact that all those guys still slept with you. What's that supposed to mean? She's in love with Olivier. I'm not in love with him. I can't be. He slept with Charlotte. Do I disgust you that much? I just want a boyfriend you haven't slept with. You should have called shotgun. It's true, you didn't call shotgun. I didn't think I had to with Olivier. He's not even your type! I couldn't have known you'd sleep with every guy at work. - Do you have to say it like that? - How should I say it then? I'm done having sex anyway, so it'll be fine. You won't be able to stop. Why not? - Come On! - It's obvious! Why is it obvious? First off, no one can stick to that. Just look at priests. They're riot doing great. Secondly, guys are an important part of your identity. No, I'm done with guys. I can do it. The bird you tried to catch Beat its wings and away it flew Love is far away You can wait You wait no longer and there it is All around you, quickly, quickly It comes, it goes, then comes again - Can we talk? - Sure. In private. I have no private life. Everyone knows everything. I'm sorry about the other night. Don't be. It sucks that this happened right when We were getting closer. You're just mad you're the only guy I didn't screw. But you're too late. I'm abstinent now. Fighting Women's Cancers with Abstinence." - What's this? - What it sounds like. I'm raising money for women's cancer research. By repressing your sexuality? It's not funny. OK, I won't laugh. Abstain if you want, but don’t push me out of your life. We had something. You're in my life. We work together. We're colleagues. It's all good. It's all good. Well, good luck! You can't talk about sex in a toy store. I'm not. I'm talking about abstinence. It's the same thing. Our customers don't want to know you're sexually active. They see us as children. Come on! You should see the way they look at my belly. They're thinking: “What's the world coming to?” You don't want that. Follow me. If you put some hearts on your jar and talk about love, that's fine. You need a deadline too. Otherwise, no one will take you seriously. Like, say how long you're abstaining. Good idea! Yeah... It's good that you're putting your foot down. The baby's father showed up the night before the abortion to tell me not to go through with it. He said he'd never forgive himself. We cried and everything. And I listened to him. Two months later, he left for good. And then, it was too late. I mean, it's too late. I'm due in a month. I took the semester off. I'm about to go on maternity leave. I'll never see anyone anymore. It's like... Wow! My life is over! We think we live in an open society. But we don't. People judge They look at others and judge. They're not very open. That's why I'm glad I'm abstinent. Makes me less of a hypocrite. For sure! Give up sex? No problem. I'm good at giving things up. I'm cutting out coffee now. It's the fourth thing I've quit. I gave up cigarettes, speed and lactose. Lactose? That must have been hard! So, you're playing hard to get now? What? Your whole abstinence thing. I'm not sleeping with anyone, for real. Whatever, we don't care. All we want is a jar. OK. No problem. We're gonna stick it to them too. Why women's cancers? That's as dumb as Movember. You pick a cause then. I don't understand how we're gonna raise money by abstaining from something. It's like: “Hey! Pay us to do nothing.” - It's weird. - It's complicated! You're not even eligible. Virgins can't abstain. They're just virgins. Everyone's doing it except you two. I'm in, but only if you stop shaving your armpits. What? I stopped a week ago. It's super liberating. I'm not gonna stop shaving my armpits. OK, so... You're gonna abstain, but keep making yourself all pretty? You shouldn't give a shit. That's liberating. Otherwise, it just looks like you want attention, like you're trying to make sure guys still want you. It's bullshit. OK, I'll stop shaving. And we're raising money for tall apes. What? It's a major issue! Hello! Wait! We're raising money by giving up romance until Christmas. Thank you! It's important to make time for yourself and help animals. By acting a little less like animals ourselves. Thanks! What separates us from animals is our ability to stop doing things. Thank you! Lord knows that girls trying to be abstinent face a lot of temptation on their journey. Thank you! They're cleaning up! - Is this a joke? - No, it's not. Sorry for helping endangered animals instead of pharmaceutical companies. - Apes aren't endangered. - All animals are endangered. Whatever! This abstinence thing is gonna ruin our group dynamic. Our dynamic is already ruined. - Yeah. - That's not our fault. Really? How come you sleep with all the new girls every year? And no one ever says anything. No one's keeping track. You sure seem to be keeping track But we don't high five each other in front of everyone. Yeah. OK. I'm sorry. - He's sorry. - OK? I'm sorry. No one says anything cause you're a guy. But it's different for girls. Do we really have to go there? - But it's true. - It's a double standard. But an abstinence movement? Abstinence is right wing! You think a sex strike is right wing? So I guess Aristophanes was a fascist? Who? We just want to take a step back. What they're saying isn't crazy. It might be a good thing. What? Just to figure out what the rules are about sex and love and everything. Is that what you're proposing? Yeah. What rules? Who wants rules? We're free. That's it. You can't commit. Commit to what? We're not even 20 years old! You're right. So why not abstain? Is this blackmail? In that case, I'll commit. Too late. But you guys like sex too. That's no reason not to stop. You're funny. Can we just go back to the way it was before? I said I was sorry. This whole abstinence thing is really messing me up. I won't get my perfect score this year. Me neither. You-five never had a perfect score. You're new. You've got fuck all. Right! It messes up my groove. What groove? You can't describe a groove, man. You know what, Philippe? Shut the hell up! You're just a scrawny kid. You don't even have shoulders! So shut up. - Stop taking it out on him. We were kind of. Asking far it, though. Some of us more than others. I only slept with Emilie. And Charlotte, right? She had a wet T-shirt! If we just get one, they'll all cave. Well, go for it! They think I'm a big playboy now, so it can't be me. This is dumb! No, it's not. It's simple. Why are we always strategizing? Why can't we just live our lives? - That's what I was doing. - Really? Yeah. Are you living yours? Or is that not intellectually stimulating enough for you? Knock it off! You're way out of line. I'm just saying if he got laid once in a while, he'd understand. You're confusing masculinity and aggressiveness. That's all I'm saying. We just want you to prove you can do it, bro. Jesus, you're intense! I think you're cuter now. What do you mean? Well, now that you're not hitting on everyone. Excuse me? You were always trying to sleep with all the girls. I didn't need to try. Guys who try don't have any game. I've got game. Anyway, I think you're a lot cuter now. In fact, I'd sleep with you now. Really? But I can't. When you tell me you'd do it, it takes away all the fun anyway. There's no tension, no flirting, no seduction. Sorry I don't read my moms Chatelaine. - It's going so well! - I know! It's nuts! People actually care if we're abstinent. It's messed up! We should at least buy a case of beer with this. Yeah. I agree. - I only drink raspberry rum. - They make a lemon flavour too. Or Sour Puss. Like a lot of Sour Puss. Girls, this money is for charity. Charlotte, look at us. We need some charity too! I mean real charity. You suck! Aube! Where do you live? Past Saint-Joseph Boulevard. The area with all the matching houses? Yeah, I live in one of those houses. I'll walk you home if you want. - You live around there? - No, but I feel like walking. So, what do you like to do? I don't know. Nothing in particular. OK. What about you? Skateboarding, movies, books... Me too. Then say so! Everyone likes books and movies! Maybe not skateboarding. Have you ever tried? No. Get on! No! No, that's OK. - Come on! - I'll hurt myself. No, I'll hold you. Come on! - Wait. - That's it! - OK! - You got it! - How do I turn? - You press down with your toes. - OK. - Yeah, like that. I don't agree that everyone likes to read. I've never seen anyone with a book at work. That doesn't mean they don't read. I always have a book with me. - Really? - Yeah. I just don't read in front of people. Why not? I don't know. I don't want people to know what I'm reading. I don't want them to comment. I've never heard that before. I've always been that way. What are you reading now? I just finished 1984. Seriously? That's one of my faves. Yeah? This was the second time I'd read it. OK, let's go faster. Wait! How do I turn again? This looks disgusting! These aren't even real colours. Sour Puss! Can't forget this. That's all we're getting, and I'm paying with my own money. My dad turns off the Wi-Fi when he's out so we can't watch Netflix. I have some DVDs. But they're all kids' movies. My half-brother is, like, 8. Toy Story is a great... a great film. Finally! Are you joking? That's it? - Charlotte felt bad. - It's not our money. What's the point of drinking anyway? What are we gonna do? There are no guys. We'll talk. About what? I can suggest some conversation topics if you want It's crazy we're even asking that question! I'm pretty sure that girls have always gotten drunk to talk about boys or hook up with boys. Or hook up with boys to forget other boys. Maybe, but that's emotional dependence. Look at Rihanna and Marilyn Monroe. No, look at Juliet from Romeo and Juliet. That's a book. Shes still emotionally dependent. It's a love story. And it ends so well! Aren't you tired of checking your phones all the time? Wondering if someone's trying to reach you when no one ever is? How many times a day is there nothing? Yeah. We're like junkies, aren't we? Cheers to abstinence! To abstinence! “No Romance Until Christmas.” What is this? That? Watch out. - I'm abstaining too. - You can't. - Why not? - It's just for girls! That's a double standard! It's a movement to help us level the playing field in relationships between guys and girls. OK. What makes you think I don't need that too? - You're a guy. - Yes, I am. But I kissed a girl I had feelings for, and she stopped taking my calls, stopped texting me and refuses to see me. I also need to level the playing field in my relationships. What do you think? This isn't cool. This is important to me. Stop messing with my head. Me? You got to be kidding me. I'm messing with your head? The other guys might be, but not me. What do you mean? I mean, you know how they are. Wait, what's up with the other guys? Nothing. It's dumb. Don't worry about it. Spit it out! what are they up to? It's just... They think that if they sleep with one girl, the pact will end. So they're looking for the easiest one. But not me, OK? I don't strategize like that. I'm not like them. Says the guy who wanted to help me beat a record. What did you want me to do? Warn you? You were screwing everyone. If you really liked me, you could have told me sooner. I would have looked like an idiot. That's it. I'm not Prince Charming, Charlotte. I can't fix all your problems. I know. Thanks! Do you know how many times you've rejected me? And I always come back. Doesn't that tell you something? That you're emotionally dependent or a psychopath. One or the other. What's up with your face? Huh? Nothing. You lost your virginity! Don't be an idiot! Admit it! I didn't lose my virginity. OK, so you're still a virgin. Fine! You win! I'm a virgin. I knew it. Olivier came over last night. We kissed. A lot. I'm freaking out. I think I'm in love. That's great! Seriously, I'm really happy for you. Far real? - Hey, girls! - What's up? Aube's a virgin, but she's in love. Shut up! In love? What do you mean? Olivier came over yesterday and-- Congratulations! I don't have to talk about it. It just sucks that you're not respecting your commitment. Give me a break! This is the first time a guy I like likes me back. Can't you be happy for me? I am. It's just that we made a pact. Unbelievable! A lot of people donated. You're betraying all of them. I guess you just can't control yourself. Look who's talking! The worst part is Olivier isn't even actually into you. The worst part is you acted like a slut in a bad way, and no one has the guts to tell you. You know what? The guys wanted to break the pact by going after the easiest girl. So, congratulations! You're the easiest girl. It's not funny. And everyone knows I'm not the one who's a slut in a bad way. What are you saying? I'm not judging, but you're a slut in a bad way. “Sex, sex, sex... Love is bullshit.” That speaks for itself. At least I don't shame people. I'm not shaming people! I'm trying to change them. Good luck with that! Does this mean the abstinence thing is over? It was a shitty idea anyway. That's for sure! Hello! Hello? What are you doing? So it was all part of some plan? What? Of course not! You never started a conversation with me before last night! You never even looked at me! I know because I look at you all the time! And then, you happen to notice me the night you need an easy girl. No! OK, you're right. But it's not like that anymore. Oh no? When did the switch happen? We ate chips together and it was magical? You'd just never had so much fun watching Toy Story before? I don't know. We talked, and it was fun. Sure. Aube! SEXY CHRISTMAS PARTY AT NOEMIE Why did I do it? I feel like shit. - Why? - I don't know. Seriously, though. Why? . I wanted to. The guys were into it. I wasn't in love, but I could've been. They're so cool. I was all mixed up. There you go. No guy is gonna want me anymore. Charlotte, there's a lot more to love than the number of guys you've slept with. Am I emotionally dependent? Well, she is too! She's a baby. Charlotte, you're 17. Your hormones are all over the place. It's normal. Stop trying to be perfect. Girls aren't perfect. Shes the only one who's perfect. Isn't that right? You're perfect, aren't you? I wanted to give you this. It's the money we raised, I don't understand. Wasn't this for charity? The abstinence thing didn't work. So I think you should have it. - You raised $2,000? - Yep! I don't believe it! This is awesome! I need boring stuff like diapers, pyjamas and little socks. But I'd really like a mobile for her stroller. Whatever you want. OK, cool! What's the address for the party? I don't know. - It's 125 Beausoleil, right? - It's 155. Hey! 125 Beausoleil, right? It's at 125 Beausoleil? - I think it's 135, man! - OK! - 122. - What is it? Hey, girls! What's the address? 175 Beausoleil. Thanks! Guys! Wait up! Do we have to dress up? I think so. Wear fancy panties! I don't know why I even talk to you. Me either! I don't want you to miss the Christmas party. Aube never has any fun anyway, so it's no big deal. How are you? Things are tough. I shaved. That's why you're depressed. - Mégane! - What? It's really liberating. I don't know. I don't think I'm that good at being free. You'll learn. I'm sorry about Olivier. That's OK. I'm sorry I said you were a slut... In a bad way. I'm sorry I said you were a slut in a bad way too. I'm sorry I said you were a virgin in a bad way. Yeah, every day of your life for the last 10 years. What's the plan? - Hi, girls! - Hi! - How's it going? - Good. - Merry Christmas! - You too. Thanks. Hello! Charlotte is here, and she has something to tell you. She's pregnant, and one of you is the father. And I've decided to keep it. It's a joke! I'm lying. Good one, Mégane! Thanks. That was just for you. You're too kind. It's good to see you. We would've known if it was Big Sebs, right? Here, Charlotte. I'm glad you came. Noémie and Antoine are official, but Emilie dumped Gendron for good. Lune and Charles are together, but not officially, and Valérie likes Francis, but he's not into her. And some girl jerked Guillaume around all fall, so he's gay now. You're so dumb. He's just messing with you. Enough is enough. Put on a slow song! A slow song! A slow song? Is that one of your tricks for getting a perfect score? No, I've given up on perfect scores. That sucks for you. Apparently, it was sexist or something. But if you're looking for a reason to sleep with me, let's talk. I'll think about it. I'll get back to you. Hi! - Hi! - Guillaume, I-- It's OK. I'm sorry. I was too pushy. No, I was caught up in my own shit. - It's OK. - You were perfect. You are perfect. I wouldn't even have believed that you liked me. But you were right. I wasn't totally honest. I was jealous, jealous as hell. That's a good thing! I'm not so sure. But at least things are clear now. We'll be able to stay friends. Not bad! - Guillaume! - I'm busy! It won't work. We can't be friends. No? What are we gonna do then? We'll start by having a conversation. - Just one? - OK, 20! At least 20. 26 is my lucky number. Fine, 26 then! - Come on, Charlotte! - Dance! Go on, dance! OK, what else? We'll do stuff together. Like what? I don't know: go to the movies, go for walks, dance. Dancing is cool. Please! I'm serious. We'll live our lives. We'll give it a try. OK, I'm ready to try.
