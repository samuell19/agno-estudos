Hello. I'm here to tell you about a cheese from my country: Dutch gouda. Gouda is delicious as a snack and in dishes. Come and try it in the Paris area! Gouda, a delicious Dutch cheese. Luc Verdier, Astra reporter. Want to know what my mission is? It's to interview women. I think it's wonderful. I'm going to ask you about cooking. Luc Verdier, Astra reporter, says, "See you soon!" I'm hitting the road. Goodbye. RTL, here's the time! IN A WILD MOMENT It's five twenty and fifteen seconds. Mountain areas: the southerly wind is still blowing across Europe. There are clear skies in southern France. The sun is shining brightly on the French Riviera. It is currently 25 degrees in the shade in Nice. For the Tour de France, calm fine weather today and storms tomorrow. Martini. Two ice cubes, a twist of lemon, a slightly bitter freshness. Alain Souchon. Hello? Yes, speaking. No, it's all right. I'm OK. The drive was fine. And you? How are the kids? She's asleep. Hang on, I'll call her. Bye. Take care. Hey, Martine! Your mum's on the phone. Hurry up! - What does she want? - You'll see. Go on! Well I never! You still suck your thumb? Are Eric and Jean OK? Why don't they come spend a few days with us? No. There's a room for them. You can have them in September! I don't know. What? - What did she want? - To know if we'd arrived safely. How are your brothers? - They'd have liked to come. - Listen... You could have made real coffee. Look at me! - Want some? - Yes. I'm knackered. - Go to bed. - Hey, I just got up! Dad... - What? - Nothing. What's the matter? - Tell me! - No! That's the other one! I'll get it. Françoise! Françoise, phone for you! Yes, all right. All right. OK. Take care, Florence. I'll put her on. Hi Mum! How are you? When are you coming? Why not? Come on! I'll go get him. Don't hang up. Dad, it's Mum! Hello? How are you? When are you coming? To think? About what? Can't you think here? Where would you go? Take the plane tonight. I'll pick you up. I'm not starting, you are! Let's not row on the phone! I am calm! You're unbelievable. If you don't come down, I'll come get you. What's the point of thinking? Am I thinking? No, I don't understand. Sorry. You can explain in person. No, we won't see! Come down! What's going on? I don't know. She doesn't want to come, she wants to think. It's never good when they think. I should've made her come. Careful, it's hot. I'll put some cream on you. Those girls are fit. I'm applying myself, see? Damn, it's sticky! We rowed over nothing as usual. She couldn't close her suitcase. I told her she was taking too much stuff and... she went off on one. Brought everything up. My mother, my selfishness... I wasn't there for the birth, I snore... the moustache I've grown... Everyone always argues over details, huh? Don't worry, she'll come. Won't she? I don't know. When I shout, I forget about it in no time. She takes a week to get over it. Don't worry, I'll look after you, mate. That's gross. - Come for a swim. - No. Look at my crab! Hey, don't do that! Now you're wet, come in! - I don't want to. - Come on! Leave your dad alone. Stop! Come on! Come here! Have a good evening. Whose turn is it? Come on, let's go on the ghost train. Yeah, OK! - Are you on holiday? - Yes. We were looking for you. Goodbye. - Bye. - Have fun. We certainly will! Want some more? We're screwed, mate. - What? - Never mind, eh? Are you taking the piss? You're going to think at Club Med? What are you on about? If you don't come down, I'll come get you. I'll find you, don't worry! Where were you till 2am? I kept calling. I don't care about your girlfriend! Don't get mad. Well, I'll come get you in Agadir! Damn it! A girlfriend has found her a place at the Club Med in Agadir. That's where she wants to think! She'll be thinking with her arse! Why can't she go to her mum's? There are nice lads there too. Let her go to Agadir. She'll have fun and come back in a good mood. I'm going to get her! Don't be daft. Just relax. I'm lost. When we're together, it's hell. When she isn't here, it's hell. Yes, but... 20 years on, you still desire her. It's classic. We row, cry, fight then have sex. Same again the next day, year after year. - It's an infernal spiral. - You had the strength to leave. Me? You must be kidding! No way! If she hadn't taken off to Africa, I'd still be the tamer. It's hard at first. Then you get used to it. You learn to make your own coffee, to boil yourself one egg then two... You take the whole bed and feel alive. And you know... what you appreciate the most is the peace and quiet. Ah, the peace and quiet! No more rows. A 15-year boxing match was too much for me. I thought I'd never survive. But look at me now... I'm a young man again. No? I'm happy as Larry. When you really were young, you fell in love every week! That'll be the day. I'd rather cut off my hand. It hurts less. A young man with experience to boot. Experience! Our girls will have plenty of experiences... You'll see... When she brings home a filthy, broke bearded guy and comes crying to you "Dad, I love him." Two weeks later she announces, "Dad, we've split up." Three weeks after that, she brings home a hairy hippy. I'd love to see your face. You won't have time to get bored. Are you hungry? What? We've just had dinner. I'm going to make pasta. Is your girl on the pill? Why are you asking? Seen the time? It's gone 4am. Here, look! What are they up to? Mischief of course! We can't tie them up. Pity that. Mind you, if they want to have sex, there's no stopping them. Françoise would discuss it first. Is that so? Are you in radio contact? You think the day she does, she'll say to the bloke, "Hang on, I've got to talk to my dad first"? Is Martine on it? It isn't my problem. She'll discuss it with Geneviève. She's spoken to me about it. She asked me if she could go on it. Her friends are on it and don't necessarily have sex. She said it was safer and would reassure her. It makes no difference though. It's a question of trust between us. Did you say yes? What would you have said? No. You think that's the right answer? No. She'll do it in secret - See you tomorrow! - At the wedding! See you! Have you seen the time? - We've done nothing wrong. - We've been waiting all night! We'll come home when we like. Or I'll go back to Paris! What's your problem? Loser! What? You loser! Touch me and I'll scream. Françoise, let's go. You're staying here. Get off, or you'll never see me again! Get inside. I'm not your wife! You think you're tough but you're a loser! I said 1am. It's gone 4. I'll do what I like! I'll stay out all night if I want. Go on, hit me, like you did Mum! - You won, you're stronger. - Get to bed, Martine. And start all over again tomorrow? - I won't say it again, Martine. - No! Women are a special breed. I mean, I love them but sometimes I can't stand them. I can't help it. Talking of something else, did you call the office about old Baum's car? Yes. There's the display car, the white 604. - Isn't it a bit knackered? - No, it'll be fine. - Good night then. - Bye. - Don't you worry, OK? - What? There they are. It's all so depressing. Long live the bride! Come see the bride! See you then, girls. - No, come on! - Stay! Come on! We'll pick you up later. - You're no fun! - You're no fun. See you tonight! Not late, OK? 1am! Look at the kids. Our pumpkins on bikes! Weddings get me down. - Having fun? - Dance with me! Me dance? You must be mad. Please! No! Where's Dad? He went home. Where's Martine? I don't know. Come meet the bride and groom. - I want to go home. - It's still early. This is Christiane and Jean-Michel. May I kiss the bride? Congratulations. Sorry, sir? You're congratulating them? It's me you should congratulate, sir! It is me! Of course it's me! I worked hard to get all this together. You see? 20 years of graft to grow a girl like this! How about a drink? Don't go in, the water's freezing. - Come on! - I don't have my trunks. Who cares! Look at them. They're not fussed! Wait! I'm not swimming with my shirt on. It's great! Wait for me! Stop! You're pulling me under! It's lovely, huh? Stop, you're drowning me! No. This is a bad idea. We'd best not. How about dancing? No. We're going home. The car's over there. Come on. Come and dance. - It's so nice... - What? Everything. You, the cigar... freedom. You can't imagine how alive I feel. I spent 17 years with a man who hated cigars. I had to smoke on the balcony. God, in winter! I survived a 17-year disaster. You wouldn't understand. I left my husband 2 weeks ago. I've got a new lease of life. Can I kiss you? Sure. God, that's good! What's a new lease of life for you? Doing what I want to do, being free. Don't take this the wrong way. You're the 12th bloke I've had in 12 days. But in 17 years I've only had 13. Really? Not a bad average. You think that's a lot? No. I feel great tonight. I've no plans for tomorrow. You don't? You'll be bored then! - Do you think I'm crazy? - No. I was crazy before though. If I felt like making love with a guy, I'd feel guilty. I spent my life feeling guilty. - And you're happy now? - Yes. And with your husband, do you think... it's definitely over or not? I think if we lived together again, he'd have to give me a bit of independence. It wouldn't be like before. And what if... he doesn't agree? It means he doesn't love me. He can love you and be unable to agree... It'd be a shame. If that were the case, I'm not sure I'd sacrifice myself. But you might though. Maybe. Aren't you married? Yes. Where's your wife? She's in Agadir. Every year, we holiday on our own. We give each other a bit of independence. We give each other air. It does us good. If my husband had been as smart as you... - Are you hungry? Do you want pasta? - Yes. - OK? Feeling good? - Yes, fine. - Did you have a good night? - Yes. And you? Yes, very good. Why? No reason. - Did you have a good night then? - Yes. What's up? You seem disappointed. No, not at all. Hang on, I'll help you. Hey, you jerk! - Are you mad? - Kiss me. Françoise, get out of here. Not until you've kissed me! If you feel any affection for me, you'll leave now. From now on, don't come anywhere near me. - Is that clear? - Yes, sir! It isn't funny, Françoise. I'm absolutely serious. I'm absolutely serious too. We acted insanely. Let's forget everything. - And do it again? - No. Yes. But you know how old I am. What do you see in me? What does it matter? I like you. - What's the point? - There isn't one! Get out of here or I'll tell your father. - Go on. - A good spank, that's what you deserve. I love to be spanked. Honestly... I'm at a loss for words Don't say a word. Don't you realize who I am and you are? No, you're going to tell me. I'm telling you to get out, Françoise. Not until you've kissed me. OK, I'll kiss you. But I'm warning you, it's the last time. Go on! Was the wedding fun? It was great. You should've come. I really didn't feel like it. Morning, everyone! Hello. - Hey! - What? Wash when you shave. You're covered in foam. It's your mum's birthday. You're smoking? Now and then... It's the first time I've missed her birthday. HAPPY BIRTHDAY I LOVE YOU You can celebrate later. With "Club Méditerranée, Agadir", will it get there? Yes, that's fine. - Did you put her name on it? - Of course. "Mrs Pouffary". I get the feeling we're finished. Don't be daft. 26 francs, please. There are boats for rent in the harbour. By the week or the month. Want to go look? - Thank you. - Goodbye. Hello, I'd like two stamps, please. When I was at boarding school, I couldn't sleep if I hadn't looked at your photo. What photo? - Don't you remember? - No. Four years ago when we were on holiday in La Baule, you took me and Martine dancing. I danced with you and we had our photo taken. I remember now. You were dating a redhead with big breasts. I was jealous. I thought you preferred her because of that. Yes, she did have big breasts. Aren't mine big? Yours are lovely. You can rest easy. How could you think of me that way? Didn't you ever notice? No. Why would I? You're like a daughter to me. I gave you your first kiss. You can't have been more than 3 weeks' old... your mum had put talc on you and I said to her, "I want to be the first man to kiss her bottom." - It left an impression me! - I'd say so. What time is it? I don't know... It's 2am. Let's see. No, it's 3am. You should go to bed. - No. I want to stay with you. - No. I want to sleep next to you. I'll make myself small. I've never shared a bed with a man before. Slept, yes, but not shared a bed. What if we don't wake up in the morning? And Martine will wonder where you were. Off you go to bed. Can we share a bed in Paris? - Will you still want to? - Go to bed. Is Martine home? I don't know. Don't say a word to her. I hope you haven't. - No, but she's understood. - What do you mean? She's understood, that's all. Are you ashamed? What does it matter anyway? Everyone will have to know one day. - Have you told Jacques? - Not yet. Not yet? Don't say a word, Françoise. He has enough problems as it is. - Promise me? - I promise. Go on, go to bed. - Look, sea urchins! - Where? Right where you are. - There are loads! - Yes. We need a knife. There are loads. I can't walk with these! Bloody hell! I've swallowed loads of water! There are tons of sea urchins. Come on. This way. Come on. - Listen, Françoise. - Yes? What? You know very well this can't go on. Meet boys your age. There are plenty out there. I'm not interested in boys my age. I like you a lot, you know. I don't want you to like me, I want you to love me. Think about it for a minute. OK? I could be your dad. You're not my dad. That isn't the problem. Be honest. You're scared of my dad. Yes, but not only. What then? Are you doing this on purpose? If I explain to him... If you tell your dad... Françoise, Pierre, grub's up! We're coming. I'm going to tell him. If you do that... Then tell me it isn't over. Right, I'm telling him. Come and eat! I'm starving. Thanks, love. Did you add sugar? You didn't get into my bed this morning. Dad... I have to talk to you. Go on then. You know, you... We agreed if ever anything important happened to me, we'd talk about it. Yes. Are you sure I can tell you anything? Of course, love, absolutely anything. Right, well... Well, what? Something important has happened. Hang on, do you mean... you've... Have you slept with a boy? But you said you'd talk to me about it first. I'm talking to you now. It's the same. What do you mean? It isn't the same thing! What's the difference? Well, before is before. After is... After is... After is too late! But you told me I was free. Free to talk to me about it! We'd have chatted. I might have advised you not to. Dad, it's something you just do when you feel like it. This is all I needed. It's something you have to discuss first! It's serious. You have to think first. I did, believe me. You just went and did it. Who did you do it with? Do I know him? When did you do it? I didn't notice a thing. It doesn't stand out a mile. I can't believe it. That isn't the problem. Dad, it's important, because I'm in love. Great! So you're a happy woman? No. He doesn't want me anymore. What? Now he's slept with you, he doesn't want you? Dad, I'm so miserable. Come on, don't cry. I'm here. You've got your dad. You see, you should've talked to me. Why doesn't the bastard want you? He isn't a bastard. Who is he? How old is he? He's 40. You... You made love with a 40-year-old man? 40 isn't old. Is that all you can say? Is he married? Divorced. An old man! You slept with an old man! - Why doesn't he want you? - He thinks I'm too young. You weren't too young to sleep with! Talk to me! Don't shout at me! Help me instead. Who is he? I want to know who he is. She won't tell me. But... maybe she'd tell you. She likes you a lot. If you're very kind to her... I'm sure she needs to confide in someone. Just act as if you don't know. Take her out tonight. I'll say I'm too tired. Take her dancing. And then... get her drunk. If you go about it right, she'll tell you. Huh? What do you reckon? Aren't you two eating? I'm snacking. I'm not hungry. Why don't the 3 of us go for a drink in St Tropez? No. I'm staying here. I'm going to watch TV. You two go out. Françoise, let's go dancing. I don't want to go out. I'm fine here. Go out, love. It'll do you good. I'd love it if you did. Come on! I couldn't do more. It's my fault too. If I hadn't got mad, she'd have told me who it is. I'll try to talk to her later. Don't rush her, or she won't tell you anything. See you tomorrow. - What? - I've got a date. - Who with? - A friend. - What friend? - You don't know him. I don't? There you go! Where's she going? Who's she seeing? Maybe we shouldn't give a damn what they do or don't do. Maybe she'll bring you home a handsome 40-year-old guy too? I've changed my mind! Will you take me for dinner? But you wanted to stay here. You invited me out. I'd like to go. Are you coming? No, I'm staying here. You go. The two of you go. - Bye, Dad. - See you. Don't you believe in love? I used to. But you don't want to anymore? What does our age difference matter? I'd rather live less time with you than my whole life with a man I don't love. You haven't met him yet. But it's you! Look, I didn't really want you to be my widow. I've always been told I'll die young. - My life line is really short. - That's just nonsense. Look at mine. It's short too. It's your love line that's short. You see? What would become of us with our short lines? Are you sure you don't want me? Eat before it gets cold. - I'm going. - Me too. I want to be alone. You were scared! You know, last night I didn't have time to tell you what I thought of your idea. Susceptible as you are, I figured you'd be angry. You're right, I was scared you'd be upset. Me upset? No! Well? Sit down. - Did you talk? - That's all I did. And? I didn't want to rush her. You did the right thing. Well? She's in love. Yes, I know that. Who is he? He's a guy... who's forty something. He's divorced. But you know that too. "Forty something? Isn't he 40? Not much more. 44. He's 44? Yes, but... 40, 44... That isn't the problem. What is the problem then? She's not sure the guy loves her. This morning she told me he didn't want her anymore. Yes, but tonight she's wondering. He doesn't want her because... she's 17 and he's 40. But tonight she thinks he's fond of her all the same. He's fond of her but... He's afraid she'll regret it and he'll ruin her life. Couldn't he think of that before? No... What do you mean, before? Well, before he screwed her! Well, no. He didn't think. What a jerk! So who is he? That's the only thing she didn't want to tell me. Why? She doesn't know if he really loves her... If his love is stronger and he wants her then she'll say who it is. If he doesn't want her then... she won't say who it is because... It's no one else's business. It's pretty sound reasoning. She didn't tell you anything! She did. This morning she thought it was hopeless... Now she hopes things will work out. I'd rather they didn't. Want to go out? I don't feel like it. - You go out. - No. I can't leave you. I'm going to try to sleep. Want me to sleep with you? I didn't dare ask. My wife's given up on me. My daughter's not much better. All I have is you. Oh, Jacques... There's only one certainty in life. That's friendship. I've never screwed a friend. You know, you should never say never. I can too. We can say it. - Not sleeping? - No. Every night at 4am, it's becoming a habit! - Where were you? - Interested? Of course I am. It's only normal. I don't ask you anything. You can. I didn't go out, I stayed at home. Obviously! Everything's here. What does that mean? I'm not judging you, but leave me alone. You judging me would be rich. Men of your generation are ugly. - Are those of yours better? - I hope so! Martine... Martine! I'm tired. Do you blame me? Do you mean for Françoise? Yes. No, not for Françoise. But for Mum I do. You were jealous. You were violent. You gave her no freedom and it's the same with me. Why don't you respect my independence and my desires, even if they're superficial to you? Why don't you love me as I am? I do love you as you are. No. You love me as a father. Look, Martine, I'm your dad. Love means respecting someone's freedom, understanding them. That's what love is. What you want is for men and women to be able play around. That's freedom for you. Playing around? That isn't freedom. It's being able to talk, to think as you like, not being watched and just cooking and having kids! Who'd do the cooking and have kids in your programme? It takes two to have kids. They can cook together too! And who'd work? You didn't let Mum work when she wanted to. - She didn't need to. - But she wanted to. You can't always do what you want. Sure! If you want to kill, it's best to think about it first. You're such a hypocrite! But you listened for once. That's progress! - Good night, Dad. - Good night. Don't worry about Françoise. She'll get over it. I don't know what to do with my Y. How about "yen"? I don't have an E. Has Françoise said anything to you? - Did you know she's in love? - Really? Stop. She admitted it. So why ask me? I don't know who it is. She said he was forty something. She must've told you. You two talk. I've seen her with a few 40-year-olds. I'm going to do "burp". That's six points. Who? There's the swimming instructor. There's the gambler. The guy you were with the other night? And the casino's singer is in love with her. Is it him? Who's winning then? We're playing a guessing game. Want to play? Scrabble? No, the guessing game. I don't think it's him. Place your bets. I have doubts about all three. How to be sure? She seems to be getting over him. Good! Françoise! What do you want? Come here. Is he your dad? Where are you going? For a walk, as you can see. Hey! What is this? What's your problem? Get off me! - Tell me the truth. - What about? What about? - Do it again and I'll kill you. - Do what again? Do what again? Give me another. I know who it is. Me too. The singer. No, it isn't him. - Who is it then? - It's me. Jacques! Hello? It's you! Calling from Agadir? Yes! No. Speak louder. That's better, yes. Jacques isn't here. He's playing boules. No, Françoise isn't either. She's gone out. Yes, fine, fine. You got his telegram? You love him? That's good. Some good news at last. No, no. What I mean is, he'll be happy. Yes. Me? I'm all right. Things could be better. No, I'll tell you in Paris. It'd take too long to explain. How's Club Med then? The food isn't too revolting? OK. Take care, Florence. You'll call him? OK. Goodbye then. Jacques... You're mad at me, huh? You disgust me. Ah no, don't say that. I'd rather you beat me up. You... How could you do this to me? You, my scout leader... the Big Beaver! You with whom I mixed my blood... Be quiet. Hit me. Taking my wife would've hurt less. She called by the way. She got your telegram. She loves you. I put a note on your pillow. Thanks. Thanks for everything. You let me look like a jerk for 2 days. I beat up the singer. But it was you, my brother. I knew life was a shit sandwich but... Why did you do it? Why didn't you tell me sooner? I lost my mind. Found it again, have you? Oh no. But I understood a lot last night. Oh yeah? After 44 years, you suddenly understand? It's a miracle! I'm serious. - Jacques... - What? You want to ask for my daughter's hand? You can. You already got the rest! - Will you call me Dad? - It isn't funny. Will you ask me to babysit? What can she hope for from a guy your age? To be with an old man at 30? Don't exaggerate. I don't mean to compare but there are examples. For instance... Take Charlie Chaplin. Take... Picasso. Pablo Casals was at least 50 years older than his wife. Going to play her the cello, huh? I don't want her to be your widow. Me neither. I told her so. And she replied, "I'd rather be happy for 10 years with a man I love "than unhappy for 30 years with a man I don't." Because your wife was happy with you, was she? - No, but I've changed. You'll see. - No, I won't. - I'm going back to Paris. - Me too. No. You stay here and enjoy your honeymoon! Come on, Jacques, please! - Give me a hug. - Come closer and I'll hit you! Subtitles: Eclair Media
