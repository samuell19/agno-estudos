Okay, I'll teach you a few moves Have you forgotten what I asked you to do? Sir, is there anything else? Didn't you ask me to gamble with the Wan brothers? Your memory is getting worse I wanted you to win and then lend money to the Wan brothers When the debt accumulates and they can't pay back then you should force them to take you to the library so you could get me the 42 Creed Sutras Oh, the Forty Two Chapters of the Creed I remember The Wan brothers Who are you looking for? Xiao Guei Tzu said we could gamble here Did he ask you to give money to us? Yes, I almost forgot In these few months we have owed Xiao Guei Tzu over 200 taels That's right, we don't know when we could ...repay him He has been sent to the Shing Te palace and won't be back Really? In that case it doesn't matter if we owe him for a hundred years The problem is Eunuch Hai might come after us Yes, even if Guei doesn't chase us Eunuch Hai will Don't worry I have replaced Guei to serve Hai I can handle him That's great How should we address you? These two fools they're so easily conned I need a way to get to the library I am also Xiao Guei Tzu Thanks... Get up There is another favour which I need from you What is it? Brother Guei Every since I've been here I haven't seen the emperor Could you bring me to him? To the emperor? I just want to take a peak Help me please This... Please help Right, I'll wait for the perfect occasion whether you can see him depends on your luck Brother Guei, if we bring you to the library can we forget about all the money ...we owe you?

Brother Guei, that's it for now we're going now Go... See you later... 1,2,3,4,5,6. Six words You little bastard ...enjoying yourself here while I am being lonely No problem I'll ask the royal family and the courtiers to look for you every night You'll be honoured My filial son The emperor is here Your majesty, Ngo Siu Bo has something to report Come in Your highness, at your service Arise Your majesty Soha Sak Hak is a traitor He has a treacherous plan Sir Bei Lak and I think that We should wipe out his family according our rules I think this punishment is too severe Your majesty might be too lenient? He has committed a great crime he must be punished Or is your majesty avoiding something? What's so funny? Although Soha Sak Hak is at fault he is a lord of the late emperor Say, I kill him now; Even if the citizens don't accuse me, they'll... say the late emperor has no capacity to judge a person Let the people think what they will I dare them say anything against it What is your reason... for being so determined to kill Soha Sak Hak? Does your highness think I want to do this ...for personal reasons? I think that our ancestors have spent so much effort ...to build our empire We cannot let anything ruin it Especially not by us How dare you be so insolent? Nonsense, I have a report to make to the emperor Who dares to be impudent to the emperor? You wanted to strike the emperor aren't you afraid to die? Your majesty, don't listen to rubbish Xiao Guei Tzu, step down Yes, your majesty You are used to fighting battles ...and less refined than scholars So I don't blame you Take care of Soha Sak Hak as you deem appropriate Go outside Yes Ngo Bai Xiao Guei Tzu, you've come upon this secret You highness, I deserve death We are used to playing it rough, it's too much Now you acknowledge I am the emperor ...and we won't fight for real hereon It's no fun As long as you don't mind, I'll fight you for real Really? It's a deal Do you want to beat the emperor? You know that Xiao Yuen Tzu... He is the emperor When I first taught you kung fu I knew already Just as well then He is the emperor, and also my friend Who are you to be eligible to befriend the king? You must remember what ...I am about to say Whenever the emperor says you are his friend you should not admit that hereafter I understand He is so young how could you take his word for it? The way you speak will cost you your life one day I'll keep quiet from now on From now on you can't use the grappling technique ...to spar with the king That's because such techniques will dislocate joints and cannot be used ...on the emperor Then what can I use... against his Dragon Palm? He uses the Dragon Palm? Yes Then I'll teach you the Hand of a Thousand Leaves Really? Sir, you're so good to me and teach me so much I'll go frequently to the library and get that get that... Forty Two Chapters of the Creed for you It's good you still remember How could I forget? I am so indebted to you ...for the rest of my life I am also much beholden to you for what you've done for me Damn, this old man is real good; He knew it was the emperor long ago ...and kept it to himself If he knew his blindness is because of me... Come here Closer Do you want to kill me? This is the 1st move of the Hand of a Thousand Leaves called the Buddha of the South Sea Remember, lock the neck so he can't hit back So he's teaching me kung fu How could your Hand of a Thousand Leaves ...withstand my Dragon Palm? Eunuch Hai said... our techniques are similar But your highness is smarter than I am And if we fight... I'm bound to lose You know how to kiss ass No, I mean it What a foul smell! It stinks... Such a nuisance Brother, help My student's king fu is not bad, right? When did you take in pupils Why didn't you tell me? Come and greet auntie I am honoured I have some business you two have fun Let's go You bad boy let me teach you a lesson You rumbustious bastard I've got you today I'll not let you go easily I'll paralyse your vital point and deal with you later Got you Alright, let me now restore you back Princess, your technique is good the emperor is no match for you You are sly How'd I know how to paralyze someone? Follow me Go Don't come in... without my permission Yes I asked them to leave because... I don't want them to steal the technique from me Your skills are not that good How dare you? Give it to me Don't pretend to be dead I'll gouge out your eyes Why didn't you go on? Damn, slut! Don't go Xiao Guei Tzu You indeed have sterling character! Come, let me serve you None of the eunuchs around me ...really have any character None of them dare to call me slut You like being called a slut? Well, I like it when you say that to me A person like you should be a whore in a brothel A whore? What is it? Is it fun? Good, very interesting Then when I grow up I must be a whore in the Lai Chuen Brothel Xiao Guei Tzu, you must bring me there The queen is here Many good wishes to your Highness Go out, all of you and wait outside Come out Aren't you coming out? Come out Your majesty, don't blame him I made him stay and play with me Step down If I catch you messing with the princess again ...I'll teach you a lesson I just came from the library... and meant to hand this over to you Go out Tell me frankly, why did you steal the book? Speak up The emperor asked me... No, it was me... Eunuch Hai asked me to take it I must say you're frank Don't kill me I will give you the Forty Two Chapters of the Creed You also have that? Eunuch Hai has... a few copies A few copies? He has hidden them away If you kill me you won't get them Alright, I'll spare you if... you give the Forty Two Chapters of the Creed But I will have to wait for the right opportunity Hai guards them securely The Emperor calls Xiao Guei Tzu I give a month to get it back If you fail I'll kill you Thank you for your mercy Go out Yes Xiao Guei Tzu I hit it by accident Xiao Guei Tzu, I want you to do something for me I wonder if you have the guts Just say it, what do I have to fear? This Ngo fellow is unreasonable I want him killed, do you dare? No problem I have learnt most of my kung fu from you I do not fear him I'm the emperor, so it's inconvenient for me to do it Come here You've practised wrestling for a few months I want to see if you've made any progress A high ranking official will be coming soon He is a good wrestler If you could hold him to the ground and not let him get up you'll be rewarded handsomely If you lose, you all lose your heads We'll do our best for your Highness This is not an errand, I want to test you Arise Ngo Siu Bo wishes to see you You've come in good time Your Highness Arise Your Highness... They are practising wrestling You are the best in Manchuria Show them a few moves Your wish is my command Xiao Guei Tzu, tell the guards... not to enter without my orders Yes Be careful Come on Come on You...you want to kill me? Xiao Guei Tzu... What happened to him? He's dead Come men, summon the Han Prince and So Ha To Yes I deserve death Ngo has dared to attempt to assassinate me Luckily Xiao Guei Tzu led the eunuchs to defeat him I'll let you take care of matters from here Your Majesty, Ngo has many accomplices I'll order their capture What do you think? Good, do as you planned Thank you, your Majesty So Ha To please stay You have succeeded in protecting the Emperor It's quite an achievement Fortune smiles upon you Our contribution is only minimal I've sent So to wipe out the Ngo family Go with him Yes Also, Her Majesty wants a copy of the 42 Sutras If you find a copy give it to her majesty Yes That Ngo really knows how to loot Eunuch Guei, if you see anything you like ...just grab it The emperor wants to... reward you for your efforts No matter what you take, no questions will be asked Then I'll select slowly... and pick something good Sir we've found a secret chamber in the study There are many valuables there I dare not search the room myself Go out Yes The Forty Two Chapters of the Creed? Eunuch Guei Her majesty must be pleased with the two of us After we've completed this task Then we'll... What Buddhist creed is this? There's gold inside? Eunuch Guei, I have something to say to you later This is worthless Lord So, if there's anything we can do just say it You're very kind According to my information... Ngo's assets total 6 million taels If we report 5 million taels ...there's 1 million left Splitting equally we each get 500,000 taels Eunuch Guei You are trusted by the emperor you can report what you like The emperor will not notice That's right Lord So, you're brilliant I'll follow you from now on together we'll make lots of money You're too kind You're young... and favoured by the emperor Please say a few good words on my behalf I'll be exceedingly grateful It's a treasured sword Brothers, let's try it hack the swords on the sabre Congratulations you've got a treasured sabre Lord So, I have no use of it you keep it It's your good fortune, you keep it Brother, this is a nice dress take it back Why is it so light? What is this? Take it back This is an amour, it can withstand most weapons My luck is changing for the better If I give the 42 Sutra Chapters to her majesty... I wonder what else she'll reward me with! You captured the traitor and accomplished a great deed I only know how to serve your majesty loyally Whatever you said... I'll carry it out to the letter So young and so smart what should we reward him with? Please decide, your highness Get a box of delicious cake for Xiao Guei Tzu Yes Thank you, your highness Xiao Guei Tzu, congratulations on your accomplishment Don't forget me I dare not Then come and fight at my place Is that a wise decision? If you refuse... I'll tell her majesty you bullied me And you also... threw the cake she gave on the floor ...saying it stinks Why do such a thing? I'll go Xiao Guei Tzu Ngo's home has 2 copies of the Creed? Yes The emperor asked me to give it to her majesty Otherwise I'll take it to you Nobody will know Good Drink your favourite soup while it's hot You have done well to ingratiate the emperor you would have great potential Pity you haven't cleansed yourself whereas I did I just cleaned I clean myself thoroughly each day You're young and yet so bad; Do you take after your mom or your dad? Neither I'm neither very good nor very bad Is not Mau 18 your father? Of course not I didn't think so If you were my son and trapped in the palace I'll get you out... despite the great danger Unfortunately I didn't have a good father as you Have you practised thoroughly the ...kung fu I taught you? Yes Sir, with your excellent skills isn't it a shame not to pass them on to a pupil? There are more scheming villains ...than righteous heroes A student might turn against the teacher some day So why bother Stand up Breathe Massage the left side of your belly apply pressure on the area 3 inches from the navel Funny? Old tortoise You like having soup with your meal So each day I added some drug which causes cramps and diarrhoea ...to your soup Such that after eating that for a while... you'll have stomach-ache which will get more severe with time driving you mad You'll wish you were better off dead It'd be so painful you'll bite your own flesh off I planned to have you drink the soup for 3 months before you leave, but... my health is getting worse I...I can't wait Sir So you knew long ago I wasn't Xiao Guei Tzu ...and used this method to torture me You went for it I realized the soup had poison when I first tasted it I told Xiao Yuen Tzu and he told me to drink the soup, then surreptitiously spit it in the bowl You couldn't see anything Where has he gone? He should have died here Where has he gone? I am dying from this long wait I stepped on a tortoise I bumped my chest You want me to massage you? Stop shouting, or I'll kill you Princess If you don't let go I'll shout Stop shouting, besides it's too late Your majesty What are you doing? I merely pressed her fainting pressure point so she can't hear our conversation What secrets do we have between us? There is someone close to the Emperor ...who teaches his majesty kung fu That's a good thing Yes, practising kung fu is a good thing But the Dragon Palm that the emperor practises ...is only practised by one other person; The daughter of Mau Yi Lung! She has a birthmark on her face Have you come to tell me this? She is in the palace right now so I've come to check it out So what have you found out? I haven't found out much but I am clear about the secret of... The Forty Two Chapters of the Creed If her majesty could tell me who teaches the king I'll tell her majesty the secret What do you think? That's right, I am the emperor's kung fu teacher So you suspect I am Mau Yi Lung's daughter See if I have a birthmark on my face Now you should tell me the secret... of the Forty Two Chapters of the Creed The Qing regime has collected countless treasures ...all hidden in the secret valley known as the life-blood of the Qing empire The valley has been drawn on a map divided into 8 parts, hidden in... 8 copies of the Forty Two Chapters of the Creed So to locate where the treasure is... we must get all 8 copies of the Creed Farewell Halt You're not getting away this easily Does your majesty want to kill me? Your kung fu is far from adequate The Dragon Palm Another majesty? Which is the real one? Xiao Guei Tzu Yes Your majesty, I am not competent in protecting you; I deserve death You heard what I and Hai talked about? I was too far and couldn't hear anything I don't care if you heard or not If I find out so much as a word is said about me ...I'll kill you Your majesty is so kind to me If I find anyone disparaging your reputation ...I'll kill him Also, get me the books ...from Hai Accomplish your task and I'll reward you Thank you, your majesty The treasure is at Mt.

This eunuch is sly Go and take a look later Don't move Xiao Guei Tzu, what are you up to? I found the Forty Two Chapters of the Creed ...in the old man's room I was going to report to her majesty Where is the book? In the old man's room Tao, go with him to get it You think I'm a fool Whether I give the Creed to her majesty or not... you'll kill me all the same Not if you give me the book At the most I'll gouge out your eyes ...and break one of your legs Someone's coming! In fact, after you kill me, her majesty... will kill you too to shut you up Stop nagging, go Where is the creed? Take it out You want to escape What a fierce lady! Who is she? A maid of her majesty's If she doesn't return to her majesty ...men will come looking for her We should have a plan to prepare for this You've caused big trouble you should get away at once There's something which still worries me Xiao Yuen Tzu, I have to escape and... have come to see you for the last time I don't know when we'll meet again Her majesty is a fake If she knows she's exposed ...she'll harm Xiao Yuen Tzu If I tell the truth... Xiao Yuen Tzu will be after my back to silence me Damn, what's the big deal about dying I can't betray a friend Who is it? What are you doing?
