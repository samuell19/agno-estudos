I'm so sorry. Can you help me? My tire... Sorry. I have an appointment. I don't like to be late. Well, would you rather be late or dead? - You don't wanna do this. - Step out of the car. Whoo! Let's go, fellas! Come on, baby! Yeah! Take it easy. The car's brand-new. No problem, buddy. I got this. - Baby, let's ride! Time to go! - Let's get to the club, baby! Your parents know the kind of company you're keeping? - Shut up! - Dog! - This shit ain't workin', man! - It's coded. - What's the code, man? - I'm afraid I can't give you that. Well, I'm afraid we'll have to beat it out of you. Let's get out of this car! Get out of the car, nigger! Come on, man. - What you got for me, player? What you got? - Kick your ass! - Come on, baby! - Mm-hmm! Hold on. Just came out of the dry cleaners. Hands up! Stop moving, or I will shoot you! Don't you have homework to do? - Why don't you go and do it? - Okay. I'm sorry. Late. Hey, hey... The game! The game! The game! What's the first rule when entering a man's car? Respect a man's car, a man respects you. - Rule number two? - Greet the man. - Good afternoon, Frank. - Good afternoon, Jack. Can we play the game now? I think your brain would be tired after a day of school. You're just afraid I'm gonna win. I'm afraid you're gonna be too worn out to do your homework. It's Friday. I don't have any homework. - In that case, the game. - Yes! But first, what's the third rule of the car? Good. For five points. I'm white, I'm round, but I'm not always around. - A tennis ball? - Tennis balls are yellow. Four points. Sometimes I'm half. Sometimes I'm whole. Sometimes a slice of me is all you'll know. - A loaf of bread? - No. Three points. Sometimes I'm light. Sometimes I'm dark. Sometimes I'm both. - I know! A light bulb! - No. - A pizza! - No. Audrey. Audrey! Stop walking away from me. Listen, we've got to finish this conversation. - Just wait. - I've got about two and a half... Where's he goin'? Okay, look at me. Last clue for all the points. Everyone wants to walk on me... but only a happy few ever have. Take your time. - Hey, bud. - Shh! Mom, it's the game. I'm trying to think. Sorry. Hey, Frank. How are you today? - Well, Mrs. Billings. - Frank, can I team up with Mom? - I don't know. It's not in the rules. - Come on. What's the point in having rules if you can't bend 'em? Okay. Just this once. - Yeah! - All right. Give me some clues. It's round, but not always around. It's light sometimes. It's dark sometimes. It's both sometimes. Everyone wants to walk on it, but only a happy few ever have. Hmm. That is a hard one. Tell me about it. The moon! - Correct. - Whoo! Good job. Good job. All right. Come on. - See you Monday. - Bye, Frank. Thanks. - Keep your snacks in the kitchen. - Bye, Mom! Hey, he's really taken to you in the month you've been with us. Likewise. It's too bad you can't stay on after Tony gets back. It was just a favor. I don't usually do this sort of a job. I thought you were a professional driver? A different kind of driving. Well, we're all gonna miss you when you're gone. And... thank you for what you did. For what? For turning the car around so that Jack wouldn't have to see us fighting. - You really know kids, don't you? - I know fighting. He hasn't seen Jack in months. And then when he gets back here... all I can hear is what I'm doing wrong? You'd think that after being separated for a year... that he would... I'm sorry. - Um, you don't have to hear this. - It's okay. For what it's worth, I think you're doin' a great job with Jack. Thank you. Anytime I can be of help, if there's anything you need... That's really sweet of you, Frank. I might have to take you up on it. Oh, uh, I almost forgot. I'm supposed to take Jack to the doctor tomorrow morning for his annual checkup... but I'm organizing a surprise party for him... even though his birthday's not until next week. I thought it would be nice since his dad's in town. So while I decorate and, um, his friends arrive... I was thinking if you wouldn't mind... - I'll take him. - I feel kind of funny cutting into your weekend. I'm just picking up a friend at the airport later on in the day. Oh. That's nice. - What is? - The guys on security say you're a bit of a loner. Um, so it's just- it's just nice to hear you have a friend. He's not really a friend. He's French. I'll call you back. Audrey, I'd like to finish our conversation. Well, if anything comes up between now and then, you have my cell. Nothing will come up, Mrs. Billings. - Audrey. - Audrey. - Yeah, hello? - Confirmed for tomorrow, 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow, 9:00 a.m. Only change... the driver will be taking him, not the mother. Even better. Vasily. - Is it stable? - Yes, it's stable. And the antidote? See you tomorrow, gentlemen. And in other news, the drug enforcement ministers... of six Latin American countries arrived in Miami today for a summit meeting. Yeah. Martin, Frank. 1156 Palmetto. I'm waiting for an express delivery. That's what you told me 45 minutes ago. No, I don't need anything else. Just get me the pizza. - I'm not paying for that... - Hi. Hi. So, Mr. Martin, that's one medium pie, no mozzarella... Extra olives and extra anchovies, which amounts to 11.95. - I hope you're hungry. - You have no idea. I apologize for the delay, sir. Mrs. Billings. Uh-uh. Audrey. Audrey. What are you doin'? What does it look like I'm doing? What, you've been drinking? A little. You said if I needed anything... I can't. Why? Because of who I am? Because of who I am. I feel so lost. So confused. Who isn't? Thank you, Frank... for the time and... the respect. I think it's what I needed the most. Bye. - Am I gonna get a shot? - I don't know. Geez! Um, we're not open yet. It's an emergency. I need to see the doctor immediately. Right. Dr. Copeland, uh, if you'll come out here, please. We have an issue. You'll have to fill out some papers stating the medical problem. Actually, my problem's not medical. - It's psychological. - Yes, Laura? - What seems to be the problem? - Me. I hate shots. Number one: There's no guarantee you're getting a shot. So there's no sense in getting all worked up over something that might not happen. - Give me the good news. - Doctor said I'm cured. Frank, it hurts a lot. - I'd never let anyone hurt you a lot. - Promise? You know my fourth rule? Never make a promise you can't keep. Come on. Close the door. Come on. - May I help you? - Jack Billings to see Dr. Copeland. I'm sorry. He's out sick today. He'll be seeing Dr. Tyberg. - I like Dr. Copeland. - Don't worry. Dr. Tyberg's very nice. Now, if you'll just take him into room 3. Where's Miss Laura? - Who? - You're standing at her desk. That Miss Laura. She's out sick too. There's a lot of flu going around. Now, come on. Doctor's got a busy day. Come on. It'll be over before you know it. Hey, hey! I'm Dr. Tyberg. Can't I wait for my doctor? Unfortunately, your doctor was called away on emergency. - Your nurse said he had the flu. - That was the emergency. He came down with flu very quickly. So, the sooner we start, the sooner we finish. Eh? Come. I show you something very cool. I'm sorry. Doctor-patient privacy in room. But you can wait in reception area, or glass of water, or... Hey, trust me. I'm doctor. Oh, it's-it's phone. - Yeah. - Allo, allo. Frank, I'm here. - You're early. - Yeah. We had fantastic tailwinds. Two hours of my vacation just like that. From now on, it's the only way I fly, Frank. Tailwinds or nothing. Glad you made it. Hello? Sorry. Dr. Dunietz is not in today. Call back Monday. Listen, Inspector, I'm a little tied up. You mind taking a cab? You have the address, yes? Thank you. You know, I heard the fish down here is fantastic. I could make us bouillabaisse. You like bouillabaisse, Frank? I gotta go. Frank! You know, maybe it's better if we wait for his regular doctor to come back. It's very important that he receives immunizations. Well, I'm sure it is. But a week won't make a difference. No, we're doing... Keep going, Jack! Look at me. Look at me. - Remember my promise? - Yes. - It's me! - Get out! Frank. Shit! The patient's not cooperating. Prep the vehicle. Come on! Hurry! Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay. Freeze! Drop your weapon! - Get down! - Put your guns on the ground! - Si. - They got away. - God! - Plan "B"? Yes, plan "B." - Oh, you made it. - Uh-huh. - Aw. What's that? - Jack's birthday present. Baseball uniform, cleats, glove and a bat. Whoo-hoo! - It's his favorite sport. - It was last year. He's on a soccer team now, and he's actually really good. - You know, you should see him sometime. - Hello? Mr. And Mrs. Billings, they're coming! Hide, everyone! Hide! - Yes? - Good morning, Mr. Driver. - Who is this? - Look in your rear-view mirror, and you'll see who it is. I know what you're thinking. Bulletproof glass. So now you'll tell me, in your experience... ... which, judging from the little performance you put on back at the office goes way beyond just driving children to school and back... does bulletproof glass stop a 7.62 armor-piercing round? Frank, why did you stop the car? Don't bother moving. I've triangulated 300 feet away. Come on, Frank. Pick up. None of this would have been necessary if you had not screwed up my plan. So, now I'm going to tell you how to set things right. Someone is going to appear in a few seconds. Let her in. Driver? Good boy. Good boy. Hi. Leave it on. Personally, I hate kids. Now, I don't know what your feelings are on the subject... but if you ever wanna have any, make no moves but the moves I tell you to make. You're in her hands now, amigo mio. They can be very gentle hands, or they can be the hands from hell. - Trust me on this one. - Trust him on this one. Now, drive! Make a left! I said left! Listen, we keep doing this your way... no matter how many rights and lefts we make, they're gonna catch us. - Let me do this my way so no one gets hurt. - Where's the fun in that? Let's save the fun for later. Hey! Look out! Not bad. Didn't your mother ever teach you to say thank you? Yeah. She tried and failed miserably. - I think we lost them. - Think again. Thought complete. Let's go. What do you mean, you can't find him? He's one man in one car! He's a chauffeur, for Christ's sakes! Not exactly, sir. We think there's a possibility he may have been in on it. - That's impossible. - How would you know? He's been working here for a month. He could've been setting this up... the whole time and you wouldn't have known any different. - You are such an expert on knowing people! - His background. He's ex-special forces. Head of an elite commando unit for five years... specialized in search and destroy. Been in and out of Lebanon, Syria, Sudan. The man is a hunter. I don't care what his skills are. I don't care where he's from. This is not a war zone! This is an American city! Where's my son? Last stop. All out. You're quite a guy. Another time, another place... you and me, baby, the pleasure we could have. Beauty. Frank. Frank! Frank! Not what you expected when you reported for work this morning. Is it, Frank? No? Is that what passes for wit in this circle? In this circle, my friend... wit is not a requirement of the job. Brutality, yes. An ability to inflict pain, absolutely. A certain psychotic, moral ignorance, blind obedience- all required. But not wit. How was it? - Fun. - Only the beginning, my love. What's this all about? A timely question. Max? Pardon me. Hello? Put me on the speaker so you don't have to repeat the instructions. In the next two hours, you'll get $5 million in non-sequential $100 bills. You put them in a waterproof suitcase. You go to the Bayfront Park personally. There will be a blue Chrysler parked on the sand. You place the suitcase in the trunk, and you leave. I don't know if I can get five million dollars in two hours. Mr. Billings, please. I read the newspapers. The day you were appointed to your current position... your net worth exceeded 100 million dollars. So, you won't even feel the bite. What guarantee do I have that you won't harm my son? Guarantee, Mr. Billings? Huh? I'm not a car dealer. Don't let the charming accent... and my grammatical, impeccable syntax mislead you. I live in the jungle, and in the jungle... you either eat or be eaten. But in the spirit of doing business, here is the guarantee. Ten minutes past the deadline, if the money doesn't arrive, I send a finger. Twenty minutes, a hand. Thirty minutes, a foot. Sounds like we have a deal, don't we, Mr. Billings? You have a deal. Could we please speak to our son? Mommy! Mommy! You have two hours, Mr. Billings... starting now. - Just get my son! - All right. All right. Frank, you promised you wouldn't let anybody hurt me! You promised! Never make promises you can't keep, my friend. I don't. It's one of my rules. Wow! Bravo! A man who lives his life by the rules. - Well, in my world, rules are meant to be broken. - Not in mine. This time, you're gonna have to make an exception. Go. Prego. - Go. - Hey, driver! No, no. Wait, wait. A little distance between us isn't a bad thing. Andiamo! Now. Hold on. No, hang on. Wait for the signal. - Hello? - It's me. - We've got something here, gentlemen. - You son of a bitch! Look, I had nothing to do with this. One scratch on his head, one hair out of place... Let me speak to who's in charge. Hello, Frank? This is U.S. Marshal Stappleton. You have to act fast. - There are three boats. - Just tell us where you are. Get a plane up over the Intracoastal. They're heading north. - Just tell me where you are. - Just tell us where you are! - Hello, Frank? - Got it. Allo. Tarconi, it's me. Get out of the house. No. I was just prepping the madeleines, and... Forget the madeleines. Just get out. - And go where? - Anywhere. The beach. Go to the beach. Oh, the beach. Oh, the famous Miami Beach. Oh, my dream! I would love to go to the beach. - Maybe not. - Freeze! - Who the fuck are you? - I'm the cook. Oh! It's a mistake! A terrible mistake! Why we can't all just get along? You know? - Hello? - It's Frank. Don't hang up. Pretend it's someone else. Hi, Susan. Uh, no, I'm just here at home. I didn't do it, Audrey. She had a gun on Jack. I had no choice. Yeah, I saw that. - What do you know? - It's more than a kidnapping. They called and asked for a ransom. The doctors there were fake. They were trying to give Jack a shot... when I interrupted them. Audrey, I promised Jack I wouldn't let anyone hurt him. - I'm not gonna break that promise. - Frank? I'll call you back. Audrey? Is everything all right? That's a pretty stupid question to ask right now, don't you think, Jeff? All right, so tell me again, Inspector Tarconi... why you didn't immediately identify yourself as a police officer. Oh. I was, uh, overwhelmed by the effectiveness of your operation... and the sophistication of your equipment. You know, I work in a small office in small town. We only have small crimes. I must admit, I was a little insecure. And you and Frank Martin are friends, right? A friend? Oh, I wouldn't say exactly a friend. I know him. We have a relationship. - A long relationship? - Not so long. - But they found you cookin' in his house! - I'm French! - So? - We don't need to know someone... for a long time in order to cook for them. It's our way of breaking the ice. Take, for example, you. This sandwich and coffee. You will pardon me to think so, but it's not very good. Yeah, I know. It sucks. But what does that got to do with anything? Do you have a kitchen? Stay back. Stay back. Don't move! Smith! Drop it. Fuck! Aah! I just found this. Oh, Jesus! - What happened? - We'll take care of it for you. - Are you sure this is safe? - Look over your shoulder. We got you covered. As my mother used to say... - "A meal is only limited by your imagination." - Hmm! That's cr幦e brul嶪 and croque monsieur. - Cream brul嶪. - Cr幦e brul嶪. - Croque monsieur. - Croque monsieur. - Oui? - Where are you? - Cooking. - Cooking? Can you talk? - Speak of the devil. My mother. - Mom! Please, um, do you mind? Thank you. May I ask who you're cooking for? For the U.S. Marshals. But once they found my badge, they were very polite. They gave me coffee and a sandwich. You wouldn't believe what passes for food in this place, Frank. But I'm correcting the situation... while they wait for my chief to call back and confirm everything. Of course, that might take a while. He's never there. - Anything about me? - Yes. They are very interested about you. They want to know where you are. Where are you? Nowhere for very long. Listen, hold on. Do you have access to a computer? It's years since having access to something decent. Oh. Handsome fellow. Who is he? That's what I need to know. Do they have an I.D. Program? You'll forgive me, but I'm not so used to this system. Back home, there is one computer for 10 of us. So, how is it with you, Frank? It's a complicated story. - You mean, you are in the shit? - You might say that. In other words, you're not arrested. Ah! Voil? A Russian biologist with advanced degrees... from the state laboratory for biological warfare in Siberia. - Do we have an address? - Miami. Park West. King Street, number 11. Get out! Go! Go! Go! Hey! - What are you doing? - Trying to catch a bus. Come on! What are you doing, driver? Not so good on the water, huh? Hit the ground! - Okay. Okay. - Tell me about the doctor's office. - What doctor's office? - The one where you tried to stick the kid with this. Wanna tell me? Do you know what you have done? Do you know what you have done? Obviously something not conducive to your good health... which is all I needed to know in the first place. Have a good life. What's left of it. Outpost to Base. The ransom is still there. Thanks. The ransom still hasn't been picked up. What does that mean? Don't worry. Right now it means nothing. What if it's not a kidnapping? I've worked with over 15 kidnapping cases in two years. You think that if they don't take the ransom, I'm gonna get my son back? Audrey, don't make this any more complicated than it already is. I'm not making this complicated, Jefferson. It's because of your job. What does my job have to do with any of this? It has everything to do with it. Don't you understand? Because you became famous, we became the targets. And no matter what any of you all think... the only one who's out there trying to get Jack back is Frank. Frank? The chauffeur? You spoke with Frank Martin and didn't tell us about it? What the hell are you doing talking to him? Because he is the last person who saw Jack alive! We found the boy. It shut down. - Hard drive blew. - Get another one in there. - Yes, sir. - How long is it gonna take? Ma'am, we're going as fast as we can. - He can suffocate in there! - Ma'am, stay calm. - It's my son! - Audrey, let them work. Are you just gonna sit there and do nothing? Audrey, they're experts! Everyone is an expert! I've had it with all of you! Audrey! Audrey! Audrey! Audrey! Mommy! Mommy! Jack! Are you okay? Here you go, little buddy. Breathe. Come on, breathe. You're the devil. I wish. - Tipov! No! - Shit! Shit! Dimitri, you scared shit in me! - Where is Sonavitch? - He's in chamber. - I need to speak with him. - He won't be long. Sit down! Listen Panasonic. It's rock music. It's good. - What was that? - I don't know. - What was that? - I don't know. Shit! - What are you doing here? - I need antidote. The driver- He inject me with virus. Look. Dimitri, where would he get the virus? The one we left in doctor's surgery. Please, I need antidote. I am sick. Calm down. You're not sick. You have four hours before the virus is active. You know that. You worked on creating it. - Open fridge. - I'm telling you... Open fridge! Open fridge. Open the fridge! Please. Insurance policy. How many do you have? Two doses. Enough for Tipov and myself. Tipov's policy canceled. There is one for me. And I want it now. Come on! Come on! Let's do it! - Let's not. - Who are you? - Driver, there is enough for two of us. - You don't need it. - But you injected me! - With water. I'm not sick? - Not sick. - Water? Water. Son of bitch! Good. The problem is solved. One dose for each of us. - It's not for us. - Ah, one for you: One for the child. - Your devotion is touching. - My patience is about to run out. - Tell me about the virus. - Okay. - What do you want to know? - Everything. For starters, what is it? It's a recombinant retro-immune double-polymorphing efferent. The child will die. Anyone he breathes on will die. - And then it's over. - What do you mean, it's over? The virus is designed to go inert after 24 hours. Thanks for the lesson. Now give me the vials. You really want to play superhero, don't you? Well, let's see if you can fly. - You okay? - I'm okay. There's nothing to worry about. It's just a simple viral infection combined with the stress of what happened. It should pass in a day or two. I gave him something to help him sleep. Call me if anything arises. - Thank you. - Thank you, Doctor. You know, Audrey, all of this has... Well, it's made me realize what a fool I've been... with Jack... and with you. Are you okay? Mr. Billings, we're running late. I'll be right out. I'd like to come by after the conference. Check on Jack. Check on you. Good. I'll see you soon. They're here if you need them. - You all right, ma'am? - I'm fine. - Hello? - It's me. - Are you okay, Mrs. Billings? - Go to your bedroom. Hi, Susan. How are you? I'm alone. Where are you, Frank? Turn around. Frank, you were wrong. It was a kidnapping. Jack is fine. Jack's been infected with a deadly virus, Audrey. Now anyone who comes into contact with him will die. What are you telling me? Are you telling me that my son is gonna die? No, he's not. Once incubated, the virus becomes airborne... so anyone he breathes on gets infected. Your son was a weapon. The target is his father. Jefferson? Well, why? Because of the conference. It's the only logical answer. Every drug enforcement agency in the hemisphere in one room. Your husband breathes: The room dies. Please. You gotta trust me, Audrey. - Can you get to him? - What are you gonna do? Find the guy responsible. He has more of this. - For you and everybody else. - For you now. We have a guest. - You're burnin' up. - I'm okay. You gotta go. Go. Don't move! - Is the governor here? - Everybody's gonna be here. The governor, delegates from all over the world. Just a second. Hello? - You can't go to the conference. - Is everything all right? ...to give him a deadly virus. - I can't hear you. I'm inside. - Now I've got it, and so do you. - Audrey, I can't hear you. - Their plan is to infect everyone at the conference. - I'm gonna have to call you back. - Jeff! Mr. Billings, are you all right? - I'm all right. Come on. - You sure? - Yeah. - Okay. - Allo. - You still a guest of the government? They gave me the five-star accommodation. - Let me guess. You need my help? - Are you near the computer? It's practically my pillow. - So, how do you want to start? - I don't know. I have nothing. Ah, my favorite type of investigation. Let's see. Alors. I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to my delegates. Breathe. That's right. Breathe, my friend. Breathe. Tomorrow, once these bastards are out of the way... and their cooperation agreements are dead and buried... you know what the biggest problem is going to be? - What? - Counting the money. - I can't wait for tomorrow. - Ay, ay, ay! It's easier with you. Ahhh, Gianni Chellini. He hires himself out to anyone looking to make trouble... Red Brigades, Shining Path. Someone accessed the database on the 15th floor. That's Gonzalez. He's on vacation. Ah, he was behind the hostage taking of the public ministers in Geneva. That was a nice piece of work. Give me an address. Miami, East Island, Pelican Drive, 26900. - We found the car. - You're one great cop, Tarconi. Ah, thank you for the compliment. Now I'm going back to sleep. Hmm. Maybe not. Move out of the way! - Move over. - What do you- Sure! This is the second gun in my car tonight. I may be out of a job, out of a house... Mommy? Hmm? Honey. - You feeling better? - A little bit. Why don't you try to go back to sleep, okay? Ma'am, are you all right? Jefferson? Jefferson, you okay? Okay, do it. - What are you doing? - You know, last night got me thinking. How do you transport the antidote safely? We need something that won't break... something that can't be stolen... something totally secure. Me. Impressive. Get dressed. Stop him. - These your friends? - Not yet. - Where'd they go? - The garage. - I'm out of ammo. - Me too. - So am I. - Where are the reloads? The garage. Check the house! Go, go, go! Forget the ammo! Get him! - What you want me to do? - Keep the meter running. Fine. Don't worry, baby. Safe now. You're safe. You're so beautiful. Remind me of my yellow poom-poom rider. Don't move. - Oh, Mr. Driver. - I'll blow you into tomorrow. But then I'd bleed what you came for all over the floor. You wouldn't want this, would you? Not after you worked so hard trying to get to the antidote. Take a good look, Frank Martin. I'm a cure for what ails you. I'm the only cure for what ails you. I am the antidote. But nice try. I'm impressed. Didn't give you enough credit. Took more than a driver to figure this out. - I haven't figured it all out yet. - Perhaps I can help you. What part are you a little... how you say... thick on? You. Why? Ah, well, that's the easy part. It's a business deal, pure and simple. I'm for hire to the highest bidder. And in this case, the highest bidder was the Colombian cocaine cartels... that wanted these pesky little men off their backs. You think killing all these politicians is gonna make things easier for them? That's not my problem. I was hired to do a job. I did the job, like you. Just... my pay is better. My hair and my suit too. Mm, Lola. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a plane to catch. Kill him. Ciao, ciao. Don't even blink. - What's in this for you? - Pleasure. In killing you. We're coming to you live from the Key Biscayne Causeway... where at least 10 police cars are in hot pursuit of a stolen red pickup truck. Oh, my! This is just not... Jim, are you getting that? There's another car that is swaying past the police as if it were standing still. - Son of a bitch can drive. Whoo. - Yes, he can. We have clearance for takeoff, Mr. Chellini. Sit back, enjoy your flight, and we will be in Colombia before you know it. We have a problem with the landing gear. It won't come up. - I'm turning back to land. - Can we fly with the problem? Yeah, theoretically. Then you'll land when we get to Colombia. Go and see if you can lift it manually. Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Chellini. Nothing to worry about. Sorry. Flight's been canceled. I'm sorry to inform you that you have been canceled. Have a seat. Relax. Drink something, and let's get to know each other. I think I know everything I need to know. Shit! Five points. What has eyes but no ears... skin but no hair, it's white inside and brown outside? - Mom? - A worm? - Wrong. Dad? - A caterpillar. Wrong. A potato. May I help you? I was just leaving. He'll be out of here in a couple of weeks. Just a couple of weeks. - Coconut? - Wrong. - A snake? - Wrong. - A peanut? - Yuck. - A hot dog? - Wrong. Uh... - That was fast. - Yeah. Didn't want you to miss your plane. That's very thoughtful of you. Want a ride, big boy? Check it out, man. You won't believe what happened to me last night. I have something for you. I figured since you never got to the beach... I know. Water is water, sand is sand. Here, there, it's all the same. Air France flight 069 to Paris. Thank you, Frank. It was an interesting vacation. - What more could one ask for? - Ah. Yeah. - Au revoir, Frank. - Au revoir, my friend. - Have a good flight. - I doubt it. They said it is all headwinds. I guess we can't have everything we wish for, can we? No, we can't. Yeah. I'm looking for a transporter. I'm listening.
