Be a good girl, Amalia! What are you doing? Come on, behave yourself! Amalia! My name is Mina but everyone called me Bambola. Amalia was my goat, l got her when l was little. She was a survivor of moms massacre. She hated it because it was the only one she couldn't shoot. There was a trattoria by the road. They sold eels and had goat kids. l loved to stop and buy eels when l passed by with Amalia. Bambola! lsn't it better inside than outside? Look! Four please. One, two... Have you seen Pedro? Yes, l saw him. Always making jokes... The fishing was good? Not bad, not bad! Bambola! Why does she never listen to me? Fucking goat! Fucking Amalia! Ariosto that bastard! Fucking trattoria! That arshole promised me the life of a queen... And here l am... skinning goats... and cooking eels all day long! Fucking trattoria! Fucking Bambola! You're like Ariosto, your bastard father! lf only your sister was like you... and if your father was still with us! What a good hunter he was! - Do you remember? - No. Bring me my gun! Mom, do you really want the gun? Yes, the gun! Amalia's death was terrible for me. l had her since her birth. l had given her the bottle. She was my only friend. l used to tell her all my secrets. All my dreams. Mom was drunk all the time. She was pretty careless with her gun. Flavio used to be her favourite victim... Stop it, Mom! Stop drinking! She was impossible. She was a tough woman, seriously tyrannic. She couldn't stop drinking and ended up with a cirrhosis. Her death was a relief for everyone. Condolences! She was a good woman. Yes, the poor... Condolences... Be brave... She'll be missed... The poor children remain all alone... At mom's funeral l had decided to leave. Actually l had always wanted to do it. But Flavio objected. He got me to stay in Comacchio. That decision would change my destiny severely... But l didn't know it yet... Mom's always been difficult, always hated Amalia. Look what l found. Look! For you. This is Lilli. She has eyes like Amalia. l can't have her, l want to leave. Then l'll cook it to honor Mom. What do you say? Give it to me. Listen... Honey, let's think. l also want to live, like you... This trattoria is all we have. Why not take the money? l beg you. Frogs and goats don't make money. A Pizzeria. A nice trattoria. What money? From Ugo, my old school friend. He has, he'll help us. You'll see. Bambola. Do you understand? Don't let your brother down. Do you understand? Yes? Come on darling, come with me... l'll introduce you to Ugo... There he is. This is Lilli, Bambola's kitten. Do you like Ugo? Are you hungry? How's the pasta? Come here my love. Come to mom. Ugo... Bambola. Pleased. Hi Bambola, very pleased. Eat your pasta. You like it, huh? lt's wonderful. You like oil? A lot. Can you get another bottle... Please. Can you help us with the bank? l told you it's not a problem. l can do it even if l don't have much money... But... l'll try anyway. Ugo was a good person, very helpful. But he was very worried about the money... And he was too jealous. - Stop walking like that. - Why? You'll miss the pizzas. He was madly in love with me, no question. But he never left me out of sight. l felt watched. Flavio was happy. l take today's special, ''Pizza with mozzarella''. Fortunately we're closed tomorrow. We can do the monthly accounting. Ugo, no accounting please. Flavio will take me to the Aquapark. To the Aquapark? Are you nuts? lt'll be crazily crowded. So what? Are you jealous? Do l have a reason to be? And besides, aren't you mourning? l'll take a black bikini. Down there? Sorry... You hurt yourself? No, it's nothing. Hi Ugo, have a good time? Let's have a drink. - Whom does he look for? - Me... He's looking at me. Are you sure? He is too handsome to go with women. lt's not too early... Ready? - Go ahead, l'm here. - Okay. Stop it, asshole. What an outrage! - Stop that crap. - Do you speak to me? Yes, l do. Who do you think you are? - Son of a bitch. - l'll kill you! Damn fatso! What are you doing? Are you crazy? Ugo, stop! Stop, l say. Enough! You're gonna kill him. Ugo, leave it. Stop it, Ugo. Honey, we didn't come here to be depressed. l made it. Finally l got the permission. The lawyer said it was hard... But l'm so pissed off... How are you? Okay. l'm sick of seeing you locked up here. What did the lawyer do? He came with my father, l have to be patient... The car is repaired... What are you looking at? l'm talking about Luca... Listen! What did l come for? Furio... The lawyer said you should testify. l'm ready for anything. The lawyers are assholes! Have you nothing better to do than to piss us off? Settimio, calm down, this is not the time. Believe me, let him be. l don't like this type, he looks scary. Bambola, can you bring me something? Of course. What? A picture of you. l don't have any. l'll take some. Color or black and white? Colour, right? Colour. Colour sounds good. - l'll beat him up. - Stop it! What's going on here? The little asshole doesn't know who l am. See you soon, sweetheart! Do you prefer the isolation cell? Furio wants to talk to you, Be respectful... Just answer his questions. The blonde chick who visits you, is she called Bambola? - You fuck her? - She's my fiancee. So you're not fucking. Good, then you'll have less trouble. Less trouble with what? To forget her. Bambola is mine. Know what she said? You disgust her. That surprises you? Those chicks only want dick, dick, dick, over and out. Get lost now. And when she brings you her picture, give it to me. Arsenio! Yes, my dear? - Like that? - Not bad... Or like this? Great. Stay like that... - Enough, your turn. - Perfect. - Move. - See my muscles? Yes. Beautiful. l'll shoot myself... Call the director! Yes, my dear. l have an idea... Here, in my head. You're a good cook, so tell me, in your tomato sauce, do you use little or much garlic? A little. Wrong answer, asshole. lt's much garlic! lt is not difficult at all, even an idiot like you should know. Lots of garlic! He is back. Let's see if he got it. How's the recipe, with lots of garlic... We love it! lf there is only little we're pissed off. Hurry up and peel it. l bet you also love garlic. lt's good, eh? C'mon, give us the recipe. For four persons. Let's see if you know it. See, he loves it... Swallow, swallow. The recipe, whore! He has peeled it for you. Look at your buddy. He also loves garlic. lt shows. Goat with garlic is great! C'mon, the goat also... We need the goat! Didn't you get it? We want your recipe! Spaghetti... 100 grams... per person... Cooking... ''Al dente''... Tomatoes... chopped... Every time l went to town, and didn't visit Settimio, l felt guilty. One day l finally decided to go and see him. Trust your lawyer... He said l must be patient, but l can't stand... Hey Bambola. Come here. Just a minute. Sit down. l really liked the photo. The jam was awesome. Settimio let me try it. Where is he? Why's he not here? He won't come. What happened to him? Prison is a very strange place where many obscure things show up and the clear ones get obscured. Settimio showed his. - What did you do to him? - Me? l did nothing. Settimio's fine. Put your hand against mine... You'll feel better. Can you feel my heat? l can't. What do you want? l want your panties. What? My panties? What d'you take me for? l fell in love. ln love with you. Love? What are you talking about? You've hardly met me! Next time you come, talk with the guard. Tell him to bring you home. He knows. There won't a next time. Poor Settimio... Terrible things have happened to him. Furio had our photos and our jam. He didn't give them voluntarily to that monster. He had the nerve to say he loved me. Him, in love with me! That beast! Doesn't it make you happy? What? Are you crazy? What's going on in your head? You're so beautiful. We must help Settimio. At least as... While he's in prison. l won't go there again, go yourself. Greetings from Bambola. l came 'cause she's afraid of the madman. What is it? You are pale... Do you feel bad? What happened? This is Furio? lt's his friends... So that l stop thinking of Bambola. They showed me your picture with the goat. Lilli. Who? Bambola's goat. That happened to me too when l was a kid in the country. l was playing on the rails... l made knives from nails... She's the only thing l... She's the only thing l live for. Don't you love her? What are you saying? Can love resist such violence? While they did it, they forced me to scream a pasta recipe. Which one? Excuse me, excuse me... l tried to cheer you up. Listen... Tell me, does it make you happy if l come alone? Tell your sister to bring her panties. l can't sleep! l think of her all night! l want her panties. l fucking love her! Tell her, fucking tell her! Tell her l love her! A package for Bambola. Here, the milk is ready... C'mon my little, eat. Hey, what's wrong? A package for you. What is it? l don't know. A slip... lt's that crazy Furio, he wants to be my lover. And Settimio's in his hands... Can't you ask him to leave the poor guy in peace? Do you realize what you ask for? But if he really loves you, he'll do what you ask. Welcome. Look what l've done thinking of you. Don't do that. l'm scared. You know where you are? ln a basket cell, for madmen. lf they got too crazy they were put in here. No one heard them screaming. And no one will hear you. Turn on the light, please. And what for? How beautiful you are... Stand up... Show yourself... Do you always dress like a whore? l like you, you're beautiful. Come on, get undressed. l said undress! Come here, where're you going? Did you hear me? Take off your clothes! Come here. You think you can treat me like that? l came to tell you to leave Settimio alone. lf you want to help him, undress and cut the crap. C'mon now! Hurry up. Bambolina... Did you like my panties? You smell good... l love your smell... l want you... Darling? What're you doing here? You look pretty rough. What's wrong? What happened to you? He'll leave Settimio alone. What he did to you? He locked me into a room. Then he... What? He hurt me. He is an animal. l'm sorry to see you so sad... l don't know... l'm afraid. l'm confused... Because l enjoyed it... Things change... lt's more like when we were kids... l was crazy about him... But l lacked the courage to go back there. But Flavio was also in love... with Settimio. He wrote to him every day but he didn't dare to say he loved him. Where were you? l feel bad. Me too. lt's enough, l can't sleep anymore. l dream of being in prison together with Settimio. Come here... Furio is terrorizing him. That monster is capable of anything. Please go and tell Furio to leave him alone. You realise what you ask me? l beg you, Bambola. Flavio, l'm pregnant. l was afraid to meet him but l had to talk to him. l couldn't keep everything for myself. You took your time. You're wearing my panties? No. l came to tell you... l want a man who loves me; a man with a soul. A soul? Here's my soul. Take it. lt belongs to you. You're an animal. How could l care...? You talk about soul... but l'm sure in your panties is someone else. Tell me his name. l'll kill him! l swear l'll kill him, even from here. l wanted to tell you something but now you'll never know. - l'm not like that. - Here we go like that. You like it, Bambolina? A kiss... l came back because l wanted a kiss... A kiss? How was it? l kept her panties. l kissed her... And l liked it. Leave me alone. Two Capricciosa and one Margherita? - And to drink? White wine? - And water. - Care for a drink afterwards? - Not tonight. - How you feel? - How should l feel? l've asked Giovanni... He knows a good doctor, it's no problem. No, l can't, l'll have it. lf l were a woman, l wouldn't hesitate. What do they want at table 7? Two Capricciosa, one Margherita and white wine. Have you thought about it? No, Flavio, don't push me. - You mind if l leave you alone? - No. - Lilli, come here. - Go to Bambola, Lili! Do you feel better? Yes, l've news, Furio got out on probation. l withdrew the complaint for violent maltreatment. The bastard has good connections. - You want to know why l came? - Yes. You don't ask why l care for you like that? Do you know or aren't you interested? lt's not that l'm not interested... l just... don't want to think right now, Flavio... That's all. Look into my eyes... l just visit you because you're alone and you're the prettiest man in the world. When you get out, come to the restaurant and live with us. l don't know what to say. Do you really find me so pretty? Hi Bambola. Surprised to see me? Yes. You're on a leave? l was released early for good behaviour. Really... for good behavior. l've come live with you. Are you happy? l can't be without you. Why didn't you come? You don't respect me. You mean you didn't enjoy it? Well, Bambolina? How l kissed you? The kiss was the only thing l liked. l want to be treated like a human. Not like an animal. You mean you only enjoyed the kiss, and that's it? - With the others you do better things? - Stop it. ls there someone else? Aren't you happy to see me? ls there another guy hiding in there? l don't have another one. But you don't want me. On your knees. On your knees! l don't kneel in front of anybody. On your knees! Do it, you fucking whore! Leave me. Do it l said! Show me what you can! Do it for me! Come on and hurry up! Respect me, bullshit! l'm a man! C'mon up again! Why you run away? Tell me. And why did you push me into the water? l came because l love you. l want to live with you! You're mine. Have you got it? Mine! You can't treat me like that and push things! Understood... l understand... But... l love you. Do you understand? l want you. lf l only think about it... someone else could fuck you... lt just drives me mad! There is no one else, damn! Don't be afraid. l love your tits... l love... l love your bum... your bum... Your bum drives me crazy... Your sent... No, why always like that? Your bum... Because l love it... Come here... You know you're beautiful, Lilli, come here... You smell so good. You'll taste delicious with with fried potatoes. Leave her alone! ls it a female or a male? Leave Lilli alone! On my bed? Do you think you're at home? Am l not right? Look at those pretty things. Don't talk to me like that, now you respect me. You won't tear it up? Don't you love when l tear up things? C'mon, l don't like this bed. lt's too soft, the only soft thing l love is you. Come... Come Bambolina... But it's hard here... l like it hard... Easy, l love only you, you know... Who is that? My brother. - What does he want? - l dunno... l don't know... Where you going? Don't go away. Slowly... Settimio told me that Furio is out. He's here in my room. Go away Flavio, l tell you!

There's something in his eyes... l like his face. His face? Well, it's your life. l hope you know what you do. You know what he is? A madman. Yes, probably... but l love him. l've always liked strong men, since l was a kid. l haven't slept all night. l can't live here with him! This is our house and our restaurant. l'm sorry, do you want me to leave? l only say l can't take it anymore. Besides l talked to Settimio. He'll come to live here when he gets out. Settimio? Both of them here? lt is impossible, Flavio. Don't you get it? Furio has to leave! lt's also... for your own good. But you don't get it! You've lost your mind, he must leave! Who should leave? Good morning. l had a bad night. Your sister's bed is too soft for me. l used to sleep on the floor, on my carpet. ls there any meat? Go and buy it yourself. Don't talk to me like that or l eat your goat. Leave Lilli alone! She's the only nice thing here. Tell your faggot brother to make me a nice omelette!
