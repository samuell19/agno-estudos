Be careful with the iron. Honey… …she's going to burn herself again. Nobody's gonna burn themselves. I'm keeping an eye on her. Tell me…eh… When's Vladimir coming? One o’clock. Have you told her yet? Masha. Wait, Masha! Granny... Today... is the day you're moving out. To the retirement home, Vera. Vladimir is on his way... …to help… …bring your things there. You want to write something? “Don't let Vladimir drink” My monster's stronger. he's going to push your robot off the table. You're pretty strong, aren't you? Anton... The ministry won't approve the project unless they get a controlling stake. They can shove their controlling stake up their collective arses. The contracts are already signed. The contracts can be easily unsigned. Slava… …this is a game. We just have to make sure we don’t blink first. We have to make sure we don't blink, and lose everything. So now we need bodyguards again? It's just a precaution. Stop fighting them. Mind your own business. I'll decide myself what to do. When my son's in danger, it's my business too. Our son! Ours! He may not live with me but he's my son too. It's no laughing matter for one of Russia's most popular comedians. Messages of support have been flooding in… from the government and the world of film and TV where the actor has worked for over 30 years. There's no way around it. You need a second operation. If I don't have the operation... How long will I have left? How many months? How many weeks? Don't stay long. He shouldn't even be having visitors. Your mother's with him already. In there. Thanks. Listen to me. I need a drink. And I don't care what the doctors say! For once in your life… …can you just listen to the voice of reason? Just once! Hi. Ilya! Oh my god, my boy! Where have you been? Three months. The prodigal son... …returns to see… …his father wither away. Stop, Valery. Where have you been? I've been here, in Moscow. What.. Was it too hard to pick up the phone? While you've been lazing around, boozing and doing nothing, your mother's been worried sick about you! She's just as worried about you! About me? She's more worried about me! But… I've only got a few weeks left to worry her! You've got your whole life! What do you mean, "a few weeks"? Mom, what's he saying? Mom? Katia, That’s great. Thanks. See you tonight. Come on, I'll walk you out. Slava, They're just messing around and trying to hustle us for more money. It'll be business as usual. We get government funding. They get a kickback. I've worked with them for ten years... And we’ve always come to an agreement. How was everything? Fine. There was a problem with the sound. No. Any talk of police raids or tax investigations… …is just an idle threat. Yeah, It’s part of their game. It doesn’t frighten me. Their speakers are terrible. Slava. We're not backing down. What's this? Footage from the rehearsal. Check it out when you have a minute. I'd rather check you out in real life. What's wrong? It's just that the acoustics are awful. You know it wasn't easy to get you this gig. I know. Sorry. There's no need to apologise. - Yes, we agree to their terms… - Young man! - Sign all the documents… - Where are you going? …and bring them to the office. Katya. Katya, are you there? Katya, I know you're there. You can hear me. Katya, I need you now more than ever. And I don't believe you’ve stopped loving me just because you met some rich guy. Katya, I need you. Are you listening? Katya You can't just pretend I never existed. Valery Fyodorovich, where are you going? Valery Fyodorovich, you're not allowed to leave! You should be in your bed. I should be in the nearest bar. Get your hands off me! Valery! Look who's on fighting form! Excuse us. - Hi. - Hi, Lets go. They've fixed you up quickly. I wish they’d fix me up with a drink. Where's Natasha? Natasha’s gone. You’ve managed to avoid each other again. Years of practice, my darling. In here? Tell me. Why are they all here? Waiting for me to die. No they're here to support you. The nation wants you to survive. The nation wants a show. My jokes aren’t enough anymore. Now they want to see my coffin. Valery, don't say that. What are we going to do with you? We'll do what we always do. On weekends, I'll be with you, and during the week, I'll stay with Natasha, and think about you all the time. Listen, Honey… can you bring me something a bit stronger next time? No way. I need you to stay alive. Valery, what did the doctor say? He said... that my arteries are blocked. …and I need to drink... ... more cognac… …to reduce my stress levels. Is he not too old for you? Let me see. Stop! Give it back! Have you both gone crazy? What are you fighting about again? Lera's got a boyfriend. Shut up! He's not my boyfriend. Stop bullying the child. Leave me alone! I don't take orders from you! MOSCOW CITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE Happy City Day, Anton Nikolaevich! You too. You've lost weight. Suffering from stress? Exercise. Running? Karate. I hope it’ll help. As of today, the survey for the district development… has concluded. Completion of the project's second phase now depends on governmental provision of electricity, water works, sewage and the new… Stop. …metro station. Did you give him our offer? Yes Your offer - is not an offer. We’d be very happy to discuss ..the standard terms... …for obtaining government support. Government support has been approved. We are now the majority shareholder Remaining contracts will be signed within a week. You can't do that without my permission. It's already done. After this meeting Our offer for your shareholding will expire. Anton. Just sign it and avoid more problems for yourself. So, you think you can just steal the project from us that easily? I'm stealing nothing from you. Because you don’t own anything My contracts are signed. I control the project. You don’t control anything, Anton. And neither do I. Orders come down from above Just as they’ve always done You don't like it, go live in London. Good people. Go fuck yourselves. Slava. Dmitri I'm at the epicentre of this year's Moscow City Day celebrations. Throughout the day over a thousand events will be taking place Luba Why is there no food? Because there's no money. If there's no money, go get a job. Here. I'm going to Stepan's to help move Granny out. Get some food and drinks for tonight. So we're having a party? At what time? At seven. Cool. Who's coming? What difference is it to you? You better be out of here by then. And take the other one with you. No chance. Why not, girls? It's Moscow City Day! Go out and have some fun. With that wet blanket!? She doesn't even speak! Lera, Do you want to go out and celebrate City Day? Take her to a nightclub! She's too young for nightclubs. Take her to Paparazzi's! Dad, What the hell!? I'm not taking her anywhere! She's a loser! Piss off. Shut up, donkey! Are you fucking nuts?! what the hell?! Girls! Stop! Stop! Calm down! What the hell?! Stop fighting! I said stop fighting! Get out of here! Tell her to stay in her room. I'm sick to death of the two of you. Brainless and useless, both of you! Darling... Lera... ...if you just ignored her… …things would be easier. Things would be easier if you hadn't married that idiot! I want to live with my real father. You may not remember, but your real father wasn't much better. I don't believe you. Lera, he abandoned us. He left us with nothing. We'd be better off on the streets. No we wouldn't. But you're doing your best to bring that about. Hello Vladimir Ivanovich. All set to go? Not quite, as you can see. What's all this? Is she bringing it all with her? Yeah... as long as there's enough space. What will you do with the piano? Nothing. She hasn't played it in 10 years. Pity. She used to be a great pianist. Maybe you'll take it up? That's unlikely. Why? Are those video games going to use up all your energy? Hello. Hello. ... while you've been lying on that couch… …she's been cooking and cleaning for you... ...you never even gave her a bath. Let's have a drink. I'm not in the mood for celebrating. We're not celebrating. We're marking an occasion. For good or for ill... …a new chapter in our lives… …should always be marked. Don't let Vladimir drink. Her handwriting's gone to pot. This one’s for you. Why? For taking care of your granny. Masha thinks I neglected her. You did much more for her… …than I could have done or that your mother would have done, if she were alive. That's for sure Listen. Don't speak about my mother like that. You don't know what she would have done. She didn't even take care of you! You think she'd bother with an old woman like that, yeah? Make sure that the press conference is billed as an official launch of the project. Serve food and drinks. Before it starts, make sure to hand out the list of questions to the journalists I'll write up the questions myself. They're sending over the tax police. Are you now on their side? No. But I'm quitting. They'll be here in half an hour. But you can still change your mind. Fuck you, coward! This has nothing to do with cowardice. It's about survival. Anton, come here. look out the window. They control everything here. And you think we can take them on. We don't stand a chance against them. And we never did. Is that what they told you to tell me? They told me to reason with you. How kind of them! First, stab me in the back, Then try to reason with me. It’s me who’s trying to reason with you. They don't give a shit about you. Slava. Let me just be frank. You've betrayed me! Anton Nikolaevich. What? Our security guards have disappeared. Lets run. The building was constructed in the 19th century. An architectural monument. The floors are mopped every day. Clean. Four meals a day. A world literature library, a television set, with one channel. You won't get bored here. When her turn comes, we'll transfer her to a double room. If you need me... I'll be in my office. If you have any problems, press this button Just press the button to call us. And don't worry. Don't get anxious. They do everything for you here. I'll wait for you. Bye. Granny. I have to go as well. CANTEEN How much cash do you have? Fuck knows. how much? Enough for tonight. Why? I have to give my old dear something. You can shove it up her arse. I'll shove it up your arse. Got it? Put the camera away. Look, that guy looks like... Arnold Schwarzenegger? Are you retarded? I'm telling you, it's that guy... There were two of them. In that thing. What's his name? Eddie Murphy? Are you an idiot? Cut it out. Look over there. Do you remember that TV show? Can I help you? Do you have any booze? For you, anytime. What's his name? There were two of them. They used to do cool shit, always joking around, And they used to make fun of different people. Do you not remember? Actually he looks familiar. Oh wow! Come on. Lets go over to him! - I promise you. Lets go. - But maybe it's not him? - I swear it's him. - How do you know? We'll just go over and say hello. You're right - It's him! It's you, right? Guys, can I help you? I told you it's him. My name's Artur. Can we buy you a drink? Look. Guys. Let's just have one. Come on! You're famous, right? Thanks guys, but I need to be alone. I swear to you! We're talking to him right now. Right. Fellas, here's the deal... You go back to your table, and I'll join you when I'm finished. You promise? Holy shit! You better. Holy shit! Listen, we could sell these photos to a magazine. Look! Don't show the car here. Park it around the back. Katya, are you home? Katya? Take a photo of him smoking. - Go on, take a photo! - Hold on. He's gonna have another drink. - Take a photo! - I'm taking a photo! He’s changed his mind. Look! Shit! The hooligans have arrived. So where's the famous guy? He's sitting over there. Motherfucker! Hey, what the fuck! Calm down. Sit. He's been sitting there for ages, just drinking. Unbelievable! It's just like on TV. Look at this. What’s he doing here? Look at this! It's amazing. It’s totally crazy! Unbelievable! It's like he has no friends. Can you believe it? Hey! Where are you off to? To the toilet. We're waiting for you. In a minute! Hey! Mister, stop! Where are you going? I thought we were supposed to have a drink together. Guys! Seriously! I have to go to the hospital. You lied to us! I have to go to the hospital. All we asked for was to have a drink. Sorry... He's much shorter in real life. Give that to me. Come on. Don't worry. We just want to take some pictures. Where's the camera? Quickly, stand over here! Smile. Another one. And one more time! Come on, smile! keep smiling! OK guys. That's enough. Great! We should show these photos to Luda and Sasha What if we show him in person to Luda and Sasha? Fucking brilliant idea! They'll go mad. Luda and Sasha - Fucking hilarious! OK, that's enough. I'm not going anywhere. That’s it. Show him what you have Look. Do you see? Anton Yes. What's going on? I'm going to New York. What? They can't touch me in New York. If I stay, they'll have me arrested. How could they do that? It's the way things are now. I can only fight them in the courts. Better to do that a long way from here. And Dima? What about him? There’s nothing I can do. I can't take him with me! Will you come with me? Why don't you just give in to them and stay in Moscow? You obviously don't know me well enough. What's wrong? Katia? Everything’s OK. What happened? Nothing. Are you OK? Yes. I'm going off to say goodbye to Dima. Think about New York. OK. You're crazy. We're both crazy. I'm not getting back with you. Do you love him? I just need a decent life. Was our life not decent enough? I thought we were happy. Please, can you leave? Come on. Just go. Don't lie to yourself. OK? Let me through. And again, Happy City Day Muscovites… …and guests of our beautiful capital! The weather is perfect… …24 degrees with no rain in sight. Later on it will cool to 18 degrees but it’ll still be warm enough. This evening we're expecting a fantastic fireworks display which the organisers promise will be… …the biggest Moscow has ever seen. so, if you're still in town, do not leave, or you'll miss the spectacle. In any case you won't be able to escape because the whole city is at a standstill. Tell me, Leosh. Why do we put up with these traffic jams? I don't know. There must be something about them that we like. It’s like a prison. Do you ever think Moscow's a prison? Yeah... Moscow’s a prison. But we love it. How do you escape a prison you love? Pay a bribe… …to the prison guards. Do you know Zadornov? Zadornov is definitely his friend. If we had Zadornov he'd make us laugh. Do you know Kobzon? Of course, they all hang out together. What's Kobzon like in real life? Hey, What's up with him? Hey, what’s up? Hey! He's only pretending. He's an actor. Good lad! Have a drink! Go on. Drink it! Half of the Garden Ring Road… …from Sukharevskaya through Zemlanoi Val… …over to Park Kulturi is completely gridlocked… …There are huge traffic jams now on Leninskiy… …Kutuzovskiy, Nakhimovskiy, Ryazanskiy Avenue and Prospect Mira. So pretty much everywhere. What are we waiting for? We could be here all day Vladimir, why didn't anyone save my Mom? What do you mean? What happened to her? She drank herself to death. How come? When your father died, she couldn’t cope. She got depressed. Started drinking. and that was the end of her. Did Granny not try to help her? Why do you want to know all this? The past is dead. Come on, old man! These girls are special. You're gonna love them. When they answer, say you've come to fix the TV. Tell them you’re here to get rid of the cockroaches. Who is it? I came here... to fix the television. Who is it? Tell them you’re here for the cockroaches! I came here... to get rid of the cockroaches. Granny! Look who we found for you! Oh my God! It's the famous actor! Where did you get him from? They kidnapped me. Shut up! He lied to us and wouldn't even join us for a drink. Have you gone completely mad? What's your problem? What's my problem!? You'd have to be an imbecile... to kidnap a famous actor and bring him to your Granny. Don't call me that, please. You're an imbecile! I said don't call me that! Hey! Where're you going? That's enough. The party's over. I'm leaving. Understand? Friend of imbecile. You're going nowhere. I'm gone. Relax! Take it easy. The only way you'll stop me… is by shooting me. You think I don’t have the guts? Do you? Go on. Go on. You think I'm afraid? I don't give a shit. Go on, bitch. Pull the trigger. Maybe I will. Are you nuts? Go on. Pull the fucking trigger. Pull it! Go on! Pull it, bitch! You'll be sick of New York after two minutes. In that case, I'll come back. They won't let you back until you give them what they want. Dima. I’m… …going away tomorrow. Where are you going? To America. Can I come too? You can visit later. I want to go with you. You just can’t. Understand? Just don't cry. Do you hear, Dima? Don't start crying. Dima, Do you remember what I told you? You have to be strong. Strong people don't cry. Show me how strong you are. Good boy. What are you doing? I'm cleaning up. She's only gone… …two hours and you're already redecorating!? I don't feel bad about it. It’s better for her this way. Valery Fyodorovich. What are you doing here? Come on back to the kitchen. No. Guys, that's enough. Time to go home. Wait up, we'll see you off. Come on. Come on. Stepan. I know this is hard on you. But we finally have a chance to change something, to live for ourselves. You know what I mean? Is there no whiskey? There wasn't enough money. What about your money? Which money? The money you have in the bank. What about it? Is it still there? Yes. And why is it still there? It's for a rainy day. What day? A rainy day, Vladimir. In case you decide to leave? Maybe that’s your fate… to keep roaming from one place to the next like gypsies? Do you want us to leave? I can hardly wait. Wait for me in that cafe. Where are you going? I'm meeting a friend and… …I’ll be back. Go on. I’ll be back soon. Off you go. Go on. That's it, guys. You don't have to wait with me anymore. We're sticking with you. Better to be careful, There are lots of nutcases around here. There she is. OK, bye. Are you OK? Never been better. Apart from this cough. What happened? I met some people and entertained them. Listen. I know that. It’s the story of your life. Let it be my epitaph. For God's sake. Are you a fool or what? Where are we going? To the hospital. We're not going to the hospital. I'm taking you to the hospital! Stop the car please. I'm asking you. Pull over here. Listen, for 12 years you and I have pretended that Natasha doesn't exist. and myself and Natasha have pretended you don't exist. But there's no use having secrets anymore. For that reason, we're going to Natasha's place. Let's go. Maybe they're not home? Happy City Day! Come on in. We thought you had gone out. Where’s Luba? Luba! She's in there. Luba! Come and meet our guests. Lets pour the first round! Hi. I want to ask you something. Why did nobody help Mom when she was dying? Granny! Write it down. I'm asking you, just write it down Please, take the pen and write it down, Granny. Write it down. Why didn't you help her? She... ...refused our help... She thought she could cope on her own. She was drinking all the time, But one day... she came to me, sober. I promised to help her. But the next day, she passed away. I know... she did everything for you. everything she could. But... I... couldn't... do... enough for her. What took you so long? Lets go! Where are you going? Paparazzi's is the other way. We're not going to Paparazzi's. Where are we going? Premiere Lounge We can't afford Premiere Lounge. Yes we can. How come? What were you doing in there? Nothing. Why did it take you so long then? Don't ask me personal questions. It's none of your business! Understand? Just shut up! What's going on? What are you doing? Have you gone crazy? I am never… …bringing her back there. This place is OK. Not as good as Lillies, but you wouldn't get in there looking like that. OK guys, here's the plan. We push straight through the queue. You have the camera. You take photos. I'm not gonna be a fucking paparazzi! - You're the one with the camera! - I don't care! Relax, I'll take the photos. I'm 'MC Tiger'. Who!? Why not ”MC Kool”? Even "MC Fresh" is better! Listen! I’ll fucking kill you! Understand? I'm MC Tiger! Be your fucking MC Tiger. You can be the guy from Ivanushki. Yeah? OK, listen up. Here’s what’s gonna happen! We're gangsters! We're dudes! Understand? We're super-fucking-rap-stars. You take photos in front of us. Put the flash on. What, am I not saying anything? No, you’re saying nothing.

Well, I’m a good kisser. I don’t doubt that! Let me show you. Listen, he told me he was going fishing for the weekend. You know, Nina, I don’t think he actually goes fishing. What are you laughing like an idiot for? There's a guy at the Losinka market who sells fish. I think he buys it from him! What's he buying? What the hell are you laughing at? Luba, take a break. We'll take care of those. - Luba, let's drink! - You've done enough work. Let's have a drink girls! We’ll finish this shampoo! Happy City Day, girls! Happy holiday.

Why didn't you get any whiskey? She's saving up for a rainy day. Isn't that right, my dear? Roma, get to work. Luba. That was very tasty. The meat was simply delicious. It’s a lot better than what we usually eat. And what do you usually eat? Different types of shit. Probably why the last guy kicked her out... eh? Listen, you know what?

I just need somewhere to stay for a few nights. Does your mother know where you are right now? Maybe we should talk to her? No. There’s no need. She's sick. I mean... She's got the flu and has turned off her phone. But she won't mind if I stay here for one night. Give us a couple of minutes. Yeah. It’s unbelievable. It's totally crazy. What are we going to do? I don't know. What if her mother has put her up to this? Are you serious? That woman is capable of anything. If we let her stay tonight she might stay tomorrow too. Before you know it her mother could make some crazy demands. Granny’s bringing the kids back at 8 in the morning. She can't be here when they return. Maybe… we should just order her a taxi? Yeah, it's our only option. Only, not now. In about half an hour? Where does she live? They used to live in Nakhimovsky. One of you better tell me right now what happened. We had an argument and I ran off. That's all. Were you not able to ring? My phone ran out of batteries. Mum, best just to forget about it. Don't ever speak to me like that again. Stepan! Hello? Hold on. Vladimir. Vladimir. It's Stepan. Yeah? When? OK. I’ll call you back. What is it? She's dead. Luba... ...I need you. Please don't leave. My god. Dad, sorry I disappeared like that. It doesn't matter... now that you're here. Do you understand? What happened to you? I got in a fight. Got in a fight? Over a girl? You're a good boy, Ilya. Proud, stubborn like me. Of course… …my ticker’s ticking its last tick, but I'm going out… …with a bang. Ilya… Keep burning bright. just like the fireworks. That's the most important thing. Do you understand? We all live… …and we die. That’s all there is to it. There’s more to it than that. Vera determined her own fate. She even died at her time of choosing. Let's drink to everyone choosing their own fate. Lera. Come here. Allright. I have to go. You know this New York of yours is overrated? You think Moscow's better? Yeah. Hey! Come on. Get up!
