"I, who live in the shelter of the Most High, "who abide in the shadow of the Almighty, "will say to the Lord..." Annie. Are you in there? Annie, honey, can I come in? Sweetie? Annie, open the door, please? Annie, let me in. Open the door, Annie. Annie. Let me in, Annie! Annie! Let me in! Let me in! Annie, let me in, Annie! Let me in! Your mother, she was schizophrenic? These sessions are mandatory for all staff, Sister Ann. My mother struggled with depression. And, yes, she was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia. But even as a child, I knew it was... more. More? I didn't have a name for it. Every night, she would come into my room... Sometimes she was my mother. Beautiful. Loving. And sometimes she wasn't. She'd comb my hair. She'd hum that song. She'd hurt me. And then she'd hold me and cry and say the voice inside her head made her do it. I'm so sorry, Ann. Abuse at the hands of someone you trust is... My mother was incapable of hurting me, she loved me. It was the thing inside her. She was possessed. Ah, look who it is. Morning, Steve. Good morning. Thanks. You make a good point. But no, we are not more sinful today than we were in the past. The human heart has never changed. Sister Ann. What has changed is that there are more possessions reported today than at any other time in history. We are losing a war that has been raging for centuries. We must hold the line, fight for every soul. During the Spanish Inquisition, the Catholic Church was responsible for the torture and death of thousands of so-called heretics. Many were simply those suffering from psychotic, mood, neurotic and personality disorders. The very structure you're sitting in was built in the late 18th century in response to a rise in the occult. The clergy would drag women suspected of practicing dark arts down to the baptismal well to free them of evil spirits. Countless were drowned in holy water till eventually, the practice was stopped. Sorry, Doctor. Are you denying that there are legitimate cases of possession? I've been here long enough to have seen things that I can't account for. But one thing I do know is the mind is incredibly powerful. And it loves to play tricks on us. To distort our reality. Now, thankfully, the Church's approach has evolved over the centuries. And that's where psychiatrists like myself come in. The Vatican's new guidelines require anyone suspected of possession to undergo in-depth physical and psychological evaluations before being approved the Rite of Exorcism. How are we doing today, Clark? Anything we can get you to eat? Let's give this applesauce a go, huh? Hey. There we go. Oh, you like the applesauce. I'll have to remember that. I've ordered a full blood panel as I do with all of our new patients. She was brought in for assessment after having seizures, muscle spasms, incontinence and hypersalivation. Natalie's mother believes that she is being possessed by some sort of evil entity. And I believe that the test results will prove otherwise. She's not as scary as she looks. She can hear you. Gentlemen, shall we? - Thank you. - Thanks, Sister. You didn't eat much. Mmm. I like your, uh... dog? It's a train. That has a tail. It's an abstract. Well, then, you're officially a starving artist. I don't know why they don't give you dessert. Thanks. What is it? Oh, some sort of nougaty goodness. What's nougat? I don't know. It's really good. You're my favorite person here. Well, uh... Us girls, we gotta stick together in this place. Yeah. Annie. Annie, let go. Hey, Natalie. Hi. Are you feeling okay? I don't like that room. How did you get out of that room? I wanted to find you. Nougat is a family of confections made with sugar and honey, roasted nuts and whipped egg whites. I looked it up. Did you know that candies have families? I do now. Shall we head back to your room? Okay. Annie. I'm here with you. Elena had entered the terminal stage of possession here. She would tear her own clothes, lick her own urine, eat coal. In the terminal stage, the possessed reaches the extremity of physical and spiritual corruption. Deliverance is still possible, but... death is imminent. Sadly for Elena, death came first. Demons are Lucifer's foot soldiers. They know no fatigue, no fear, no doubt. When you enter the room of the possessed, you are walking onto a battlefield. The Devil will try to distract you. Sow doubt in God's word. Always remember, the word of God is your most powerful weapon. But the Rite is not just a series of prayers. It's a dance. We have to feel the cadence of the battle. Work with our partners. Understand the correct entry points for attack. Regrettably, the priests made fatal errors in Elena's exorcism. What would you have done differently? My mother talked about hearing that voice inside. She said the voice didn't really want her. It wanted me. Because I was one of God's chosen soldiers. Sister. Hi. I'm reviewing some cases and there seems to be some gaps in the directory. The records are entered directly into the main archive. There are no gaps. And what about the terminal cases? Those are classified. You summoned me, Sister? I understand that Sister Ann has taken it upon herself to attend another one of your classes. I wouldn't say "attend." More like "infiltrate." She's very light on her feet. The rules of the Church are quite clear, Father. Only male clergy may be enrolled in exorcism training. For now. You should be grateful, child. In years past, even patient care in exorcism school was restricted to priests. Now here you stand. But what does it matter if I'll never be able to perform an exorcism? Is a nurse of no benefit to her patients because she can't perform surgery? Female surgeons were once unthinkable. Somebody had to be the first. Yes. Well, healing the flesh is a very different undertaking than healing the spirit. As members of the Catholic community of women, it is not our place to free these souls from their tormentors. We are here to comfort, to pray, and show mercy. That is all. You may return to your duties now. Yes, Sister. Father. She wants to learn. And I want to protect her. Clark, how do you know that song? We've been waiting for you. Your mother has a pretty voice. Hello, can anybody hear me? Let me in. No! No! I've seen enough. This demon appeared to go after Sister Ann without cause. Provoked by her mere presence. For her own protection, and that of others here at St. Michael's, we should send her back to the convent. Evil isn't confined to the walls of this institution. I'd feel better having her here. I can work with her. Keep an eye on her. Work with her? In what sense? I'd like to teach her, Your Eminence. That's against all precedent, all doctrine. Nothing formal. Just enough to protect herself and others. I'm not sure of the exact nature of it. But this relationship she has... it's personal. But, Father, we all have a personal relationship with God. Not with God, Sister. With the Devil. The citadel has fallen. The walls have crumbled. Black smoke blots out the sun. Because, as some of you may already know, we have a female student in the class as an observer. Sister Ann will be accompanying us on our rounds for the rest of the term. Now pay close attention. The nuances of our craft require active learning to truly understand. So, group one, let's descend into the mouth of hell, shall we? Clear your minds of all thoughts but prayer. You must remain resolute despite the distractions. It can be the difference between life and death for both you... and the afflicted. The subject is a recent admission. Dr. Peters' preliminary diagnosis was idiopathic epilepsy. The subject was moved here to observation when she began to exhibit behavior that Dr. Peters couldn't explain. Natalie is 10 years old. We have to act quickly to halt any further escalation. I need two volunteers. I'll go, Father. Very well. You will take the lead. Who would like to assist Father Dante? I will. Father Raymond. The armor of God. Each of you have performed a simple exorcism every time you baptized a child. Cleansing them of their original sin. That was baptism by holy water. This is baptism by fire. Remember, the name "Lucifer" derives from the Latin term "lucem ferre." "Bringer of light." The Devil will shine his light into the darkest, deepest recesses of your mind, exposing your innermost secrets. Your deepest pain. He will use this pain to break into your soul. You must look past the girl. She is as much demon as victim. In Nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Amen. Christ, have mercy. Strike terror, Lord, into the beast now defiling this innocent child. Stretch out your mighty hand, Lord. And cast this demon out of your servant, Natalie Hope. We cast you out. No! Stay far from this creature of God. For it is He who commands you. He who flung you headlong... No. Oh, shit. Father... Pray. Pray together. For it is He who commands you. Oh, he who flung you headlong from the heights of Heaven into the depths of Hell! Una chica. Don't stop. Commit to the words. For it is He who commands you. He who flung you headlong from the heights of Heaven into the depths of Hell. Into the depths of Hell. It is He who commands... Let me in! Lord, repel this Devil's powers. By the incarnation, passion, resurrection, and ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ, I command you to depart this child of God. Father. Say something. Say something, Father. Natalie. Natalie, can you hear me? Sister Ann, don't deviate from the scripture. Natalie. Natalie, I'm here. I'm here with you. I'm scared. Natalie, I'm here. Go! Father. Give place, abominable creature. Give way to Christ. You are a shield about me, my glory, the lifter of my head. Sister, with me now. I cast you forth into outer darkness where everlasting ruin awaits you. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I cast you out. Hey. Hi, sweetie. It's okay. She's okay. I have to start wearing adult diapers to class. You and me both. To you. Hey, who knows what would've happened if you hadn't stepped in there. It's not a sin to take a little victory lap, right? No, I thought I got through to her. For... a moment. But... FATHER DANTE: Hey, you did. And it weakened the demon 'cause Natalie was still in there somewhere. I don't know. If Father Quinn hadn't stepped in... You okay? Uh, yeah. I think this was meant for me. Why? My baby sister, Emilia. She, uh... She was raped. She got pregnant. I'm so sorry. She, uh... She lost the baby. She's been afflicted ever since. Hi. How are you feeling? Kinda sleepy. This isn't my room. No. This is a special room. I had a bad dream. I'm sorry. Can you tell me what you remember about it? I was in a room. It was kinda like this room. And... there were people. They were all yelling. Were they yelling at you? Couldn't understand most of them. I think they were talking to someone else. Who? The voice. Whose voice? He tells me things. Promises me things. Sometimes... he shows me things. They're bad. It's all right. You can tell me. You were there. But... you weren't yelling. Natalie? Natalie wasn't cleansed, was she? We're not sure. The demon may have undertaken temporary refuge. Will the Rite be administered again? The girl will remain in observation. If she escalates further, it may be beyond our capacity to deal with. She'll be transferred to the Vatican. You mean she might be a terminal case? I want to stay with her, Father. I've made a connection. That's exactly the problem. The exorcist is a confessor and an intercessor, not a friend. But what if I can help her? Terminal cases are the most complex and delicate we face. They can only be handled by the most skilled exorcists. If you want to help her, pray. Your power is in the spirit. Not the flesh. She may still make a full recovery. Sister, Cardinal Matthews is requesting this urgently. So, what happened when the soldiers came to your house that day? It was me and my two younger sisters. They said one of us could go. I ran. I didn't wait for anything. I just ran. You ran away and... and the soldiers shot your sisters? Yes. Mila, tell me about the voice that you heard. I kept hearing those shots. The demon spoke to me in the sound of those gunshots. He took control. Okay. But then you were cleansed, right? You received the Rite of Exorcism. And you were healed. "Healed"? I kept cutting, but the body is still here. You did that to yourself? I prayed for God's forgiveness. I prayed and I prayed, but deep down I knew. I didn't deserve forgiveness. My mother felt guilt for what she had done. I was alone with her. Annie? Where are you? Annie? Annie! What you're describing is terrifying. It's traumatic. Memories like these are so hard to face. Your mother, she eventually... She took her own life. And you felt responsible for her death. That's a common trauma response, Ann. For the victim to feel shame. And the only way to disarm these memories is to drag them into the light. Confront the trauma. What're you doing down here? What's going on with Natalie? They restricted access. Why? No idea. Maybe they're transferring her. Father Dante. Hi. Right. Father. You can't let Natalie be transferred. I've seen the records. The mortality rate for terminal cases is over 90%. Our faith does not reside in statistics, Sister. No. No, it doesn't. But I don't think that it resides strictly in the word of the Rite either. No? The Rite has stood for millennia as the received word of God. And you have notes? Where did you read these records anyway? I know, I broke the rules. But there is a lonely, frightened little girl at the center of this. You tread on precarious ground when you make this fight personal. But it is personal, Father. That is the point. You said yourself that exorcism is about nuance. And yet, we have never even considered it from the victim's perspective. So what does the demon want? It wants to dehumanize the possessed and make them feel unworthy of God's love. Our goal should be to connect with the possessed and help them fight for their own humanity. Let them know we see them, not just the demon. Is it not possible that there are cases, unique cases, that the Rite cannot account for? What makes these cases unique? Cases where the victim's shame and guilt are so profound that they invite the demon in. And they want to suffer. They surrender control. So where does Natalie's shame come from? Hmm? She is an innocent child. I don't know. Lucifer was once the most beautiful and powerful angel in Heaven. But he became prideful and God cast him out. That... That's it, Sister. I believe in you, more than you can imagine. But you have to understand the danger here. If you shun the Church to follow your own will, you will find yourself wandering in the darkness. Alone. Father. I heard what you said. They can't let Natalie be transferred. She won't come back. I agree. And we don't have much time. What do you mean? So, what if there was a way that you could prove to them that you're right. Your sister. She's possessed, Ann. I know she is. And her episodes just keep getting worse. I tried to have her admitted here, but... it's complicated for the Church. Because of her baby. She's devout. Ann, you talk about guilt. She had to make an impossible decision. And it's eating away at her. She let the demon in. You want to attempt an unauthorized exorcism? Not alone. Please, Ann. My sister doesn't have much time left. And I saw you with Natalie. You have a gift. You connect with the possessed. You see past the demon and into the person. If you really believe what you're saying... Natalie is still possessed. And she's still alive. Hi, Mama. Mi hijo. My mother says she's been asleep for three days. Are you ready? Are you? Chiquita, this is... This is Ann. She's here to help you. Okay? Emilia. Can you hear me? It won't stop. The voice? It has no power over you that you don't give it. Okay. "Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered." "Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord does not count against them, "and in whose spirit is no deceit." You know what it feels like to have something growing inside you. Don't you, Sister? Yes. At least this bitch knew who the baby's father was. Help me! Please! Please! Emilia, listen to me. Focus on the sound of my voice. She can't hear you. Emilia, the demon preys on the most devout because our guilt, it is the deepest. Ann... Open your eyes. This flesh... This flesh is yours. It is not his. You don't have to hide from it anymore. I know you wanted the baby to be gone. You wanted it to be over. Like you did? Yes. Ann... I know despair. How shame gets in and rips you open. It's always there and it just grows. Ann. Psalm 86:5. "For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving, "abounding in steadfast love to all who call..." He can never shut out God's love for you. Don't hide from it. All of the pain. Follow me into the pain. We'll go there together. "For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving..." Confess to yourself and you will be forgiven. How did you do... It's over. Emilia, you're free. You freed yourself. That tattoo above your wrist... is that a gang thing? It was, yeah. I got pregnant when I was 15. Was too wasted to remember who the father was. They kicked me out of my foster home. And by God's grace, I found my way to the shelter run by the Sisters of St. Mary. And they took me in. Cared for me. What about the baby? The sisters arranged for her adoption. I only held her for a moment. But I, uh... I've carried her with me ever since. I abandoned her. And I pray that... that God can forgive me. "For you, O Lord, are good... "and forgiving." Hey. He already has. Cardinal Matthews is calling for you. Yes, Sister. Your Eminence. I'm afraid I have some tragic news. Father Dante's sister, Emilia, took her own life last night. What? Emilia's mother reported to the parish that you attempted an exorcism on her. Is this true? I'm so sorry. Then it is true. Yes, I thought that I... You thought you knew better than a church that has stood for thousands of years? Of course not. You overestimated your competence and stepped right into the Devil's snare. Please. It wasn't Sister Ann's fault. I was desperate. You weren't remotely prepared to take on an exorcism like this. Demons retreat to avoid further assault. It was a deception. Not a defeat. You've both betrayed the trust the Church put in you. That I advocated for. I think... I think it's best if I return to my place with the Sisters of St. Mary. Come in. Thank you for seeing me. Well, this is grim. Although, apparently, the abbess, Benedetta Carlini, spent the last 35 years of her life in a 6-by-6 hole in the ground. On her dying day, she said she never had a moment's regret. I didn't realize you were so familiar with the lexicon of Catholic mystics. I'm an academic. I like to hear both sides. I heard about what happened. Father Dante's sister. I really thought I'd gotten through to her. I came... to give you this. "Brain, mind, and body in the healing of... "trauma." I know you're a one book kinda gal, but I thought you might enjoy some light exile reading. Ann. I've had patients that... no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't save them. You might be relieved to know that Natalie was released. What? She was cleared after observation, and she went home with her mother this morning. You're on a new path. It's natural to feel lost. Keep going. Father Dante. Sister Ann. What're you doing here? Something's happened at the school. Natalie. Walk with me. She suffered a sudden relapse and they rushed her back. A priest and two orderlies were killed. I will pray for their souls and for Natalie's deliverance. She's a terminal case. She'll be transferred back to Rome. No, we don't have time for that. She has hours left, not days. They moved her to the catacombs beneath the main building. They still have holding cells there. Holding cells? Part of the original structure. They have her totally sealed away from the rest of the academy. I don't think they're willing to risk more lives to attempt another exorcism. Why? Why come and tell me this? Because she gave me this. I got this when I first arrived here at St. Mary's. And I wrapped it around the wrist of my little girl the day I gave her away. Father. Natalie is my daughter. The demon is using her to get to me. I can't let her suffer for me. I won't. Most glorious Prince of the heavenly armies, Michael the Archangel. Defend us in battle against principalities and powers. Against the rulers of darkness in this world... against the spirits of wickedness... in these high places. May Thy mercy descend upon us, Lord. Amen. Is that holy water? Yeah. It's the baptismal well. Spirits, demonic forces, satanic powers, principalities, along with... air, water, fire... Turn around. Right now. Raymond, move. Are you insane? She killed your sister. She did not. Move. Don't act like a stranger. You've got my invitation. Natalie. Let them leave. Natalie. Ann. Natalie. Natalie. Raymond. Raymond! Raymond. No. Why did you leave me, Mommy? I was so scared and alone without you. You're not Natalie. I know who I'm talking to. Then be honest for once. Why did you give her away? I was 15. No. That's not it. What happened to your mother? She sacrificed herself to save you. That's why you couldn't be a mother. You couldn't be responsible for another life. But I can now. Ann. Ann! You win. I love you so much, Mommy. Natalie. Ann! Run. What's happening? Natalie. I'm Father Dante. We're gonna play a game of hide-and-seek. Okay? I need you to go through here. Come on. Okay. Listen to me. I need you to find the very best hiding spot that you can, okay? Go. Go. Come on. Come on. Ann. Ann, I know you're in there, okay? I need you to listen to me, okay? Just let Natalie go, please? Let her go. Don't be scared. Annie. Annie. Let go, Annie. Let go, Annie. Annie, let go. Annie, let go. I'm here with you. My mother never stopped fighting the demon from within. Right until the end. Let go. I'm here with you. Ann! Blessed Michael the Archangel. Defend us in this hour of conflict. Be our safeguard. Thrust Satan down to hell. Your power is in the spirit. Not the flesh. You're on a new path. Keep going. You don't have to hide from it anymore. All of the pain. Let go, Annie. Ann. Ann. Ann. If you follow me, we can finish up the paperwork. Of course. Hi. I know it doesn't seem like it now, but when you are home with your family and your friends, you'll forget all about this place. But I don't want to forget about you. Then don't. Your train. I will treasure this. Thank you. Without your intercession, the enemy would've won this battle. You clearly have an important role to play in the Church, Sister Ann. We've discussed where your talents might be best placed. So, we are rewarding you an academic research fellowship at the Vatican. A fellowship in exorcism. Thank you. It's an unprecedented honor. We think you could make a difference there, Sister. Thank you... for everything. Mmm. You know, technically speaking, you're not the first female exorcist. St. Catherine of Siena? Indeed. She died in 1380. Right. So the first in seven centuries. I'll take it. If I may give you one last word of advice? Of course, Father. Be careful. Now that you know the Devil, the Devil knows you. The overnight low near 47th. Rain tapering off tomorrow afternoon followed by... As for your weather today, with the winds out of the southeast at 12 miles per hour, it's currently 58 degrees. Annie. Annie.
