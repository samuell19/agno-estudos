Have I said this to you before? Who the fuck are you, man? No pushing. No pushing. No, no pushing. Baby, I'm dealing with it. [Crowd gasps] Suraj, are you okay?!

[Man and child screaming] [gun cocks and fires] I hope you got a nice, warm welcome. Great, sir. [Light jazzy music] S.N. Kashyap, sir. [Plate clatters] Emotionless bugger! You know, when he heard about your transfer. I guess he didn't want to lose a fine officer like you. I'm just a regular cop. It was a lucky break. We were running after this case for a number of years. [Phone vibrates] - Just doing my job, sir. - Hmm. - Yes? - [Man on phone] Good evening, sir. Bharat Sinha's just been reported dead. Approximately two hours ago. Okay. Inform Bates immediately. - Yes, sir. - Immediately, please! - Thank you. - Good night, sir. There are no lucky breaks in life. You were not doing your job, you were doing your duty. Your job is doing what is required. Your duty is doing what is right. My duty is my job, sir. Anyway. Welcome on board, my son! - Very proud of you. - Thank you, sir. Anne. Where did you get a husband like this? - Thank you, sir! - Mm. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock sharp. - Yes. - In my office. There's a gentleman I want you to meet. Sure, sir. Good. Enjoy your meal! [Gentle music] Just be proud of yourself, no? Like I'm of you. It was a freak accident. That's it. Sorry. [Crowd chattering] [gentle music] [sobbing] It's not your fault. [Indian themed music in the background] [fire crackling] [phone ringing] Deputy Commissioner, Daniel Bates. - Sir. - U.K. Interpol. I see you've already met Amin. This is my associate, Arjun Chole. We'll try not to keep you. Amin, shall we? Bharat Sinha was the patriarch of an important crime family known to dealing real estate pirating. He has passed. Mafia types you've heard, usually hired by shady builders and shadow outfits. A part of Delhi-city's infamous land mafia. We are aware of half a dozen families currently operating in this fashion. The Sinhas, namely Bharat, even in death remain the most unique. To give you a better idea of what we're dealing with here, we must navigate to the genesis that is Bharat. [Gentle music] [switch flicks] [machine whirring] Late 1940's, Delhi. Independence. End of an empire. [People chatter] Just as Her Majesty packed her bags. [Camera clicks] Bharat's first wife was pregnant with their first child. They would name him Prithvi in honor of his twin brother. A hard worker and a believer in the new democratic India, Bharat and his brother became successful with a popular restaurant. Life took a tragic turn when Prithvi was met with an accident. Sustaining life-threatening injuries. Prithvi? Prithvi? [Daniel] The only way he could survive was through extensive surgical procedures. [Bharat crying] But in no way could he carry the hospital's bill. So he had no choice but to sell his restaurant. [Baby crying] [Daniel] Then, he waited for his money. And waited. And waited. The money would never come. [Nurse] Sorry. [Daniel] As a result, Prithvi died in front of his eyes. In a fit of rage, he went around to the eldest brother's house, stabbed him through the heart with a steak knife. Which means he got his property back, but Prithvi's needless death left a hole in his life. [Daniel] Until he met an interesting individual named Morris Burns. A British gangster who happened to be living in Delhi. Bharat sold everything to Morris, and stuck a criminal partnership. Morris, the money, the emotional support. Bharat, a hungry and angry man who knew Delhi's people and places. Many of his customers and clients... were our own police. This is how he slowly architected the land mafia syndicate under everyone's noses. [Phone ringing] [man on phone] Officer Singh, sir. Yes, sir. Gurpreet lit herself on fire in front of their two sons. Unable to live with the monster Bharat had become. It's ruled an accident. Need I say more? [People chattering] [Daniel] Then, a girl. [Daniel] Neema. [Amin] Neema Aziz. Who became Neha Sinha right at marriage. [Daniel] When his new wife joined the family along with their newly born son, Suraj. Many operations disappeared from our radars. Local thuggery intensified with his two adult sons gaining more control. [Soft tense music] You can't understand a man without understanding his family. With family comes a reason to live. Bharat's eldest, Prithvi. He's the general. Acting CEO of the Sinha mafia. He's a carbon copy of his father in word and deed. The middle son, Siddarth, unpredictable. When he's boxed in, he'll fight back. Borderline psychotic with a penchant for savage acts of brutal, sadistic violence. He's also got a hard-on for weaponry, so it would come as no surprise to us if he pulled his family into the international arms trade. That or maybe stuck it out alone. This is where you come in, Officer Raghav. The moment we heard of Bharat's demise, we flew here to work shoulder to shoulder with your good Commissioner, Shah and Amin. We need someone with your integrity and experience in the trenches to set a trap. We need an officer new to Delhi. Someone they can't manhandle, like so many before. Meet Manjit. He's been leading undercover maneuvers in both countries. He and his team will fill you in with all covert logistics. Thank you, Manjit. - Good luck, Officer Raghav. - Thank you, sir. [Crying] [Nya cooing] [Nya cooing] Hamshaid. [Gentle music] [soft trumpet music] [soft tense music] Sir. Anywhere away from this fucked up city. This is my fortune also. I earn it. We'll do it bigger as partners. With your father's name. The man I love Is a man bigger than a TV salesman. Your brother has betrayed you. You need to get rid of him. That's the only way, Sid. He's a hindrance between you and me. When he's gone we'll be together. A new life. A new family. Arms. Hey? Pakistan, Afghanistan. [Soft dramatic music] [phone ringing] [gun firing] - [gun firing] - [motorcycle engine revving] [chains rattling] - [thump] - [Prithvi grunts] [masked man screams] - [flesh slicing] - [Prithvi yelps] - [bones crushing] - [man grunts] - [gun fires] - [man grunts] [gun fires] [gun fires] [motorcycle engines revving] [car door closes] [ambulance siren] I mean. It's a miracle. You know? Siddarth Sinha? Oh, hello, Officer. Hello, Doctor. - Excuse me. - Sure. - Excuse me. - Thank you. Siddarth Sinha? [Sighs loudly] Last question. [Chuckles] Oh, I'm sorry! Thank you. Nothing, sir. [Heart-rate monitor beeping] [door opens] [crows cawing] [grunts] Arms smuggling. Huh? Hey? [Machines whirring] [laughs uncontrollably] The material that I've bought for you. Straight from Russia. Same place where you are from. Russia? Do I sound like I'm from Russia to you? You fat fuck! - [Door opens] - [footsteps approach] I'm from Lake Timber, Alaska. You know where Lake Timber, Alaska is? Of course you don't, no one knows where Lake Timber fucking Alaska is. That's where I'm from. [Cocks gun] This is good metal! Yeah, it is. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much! So, tell you what, um, I'll give you twenty lacs now, and you come back tomorrow, and I'll give you the other 20. But we had a deal, no? Fifty lac on delivery. And I had so much of difficulty bringing all this over here. Look, look, look. I'm just a simple businessman. I work on day to day rates. You called me yesterday and the rate was fifty. Today it's forty. Tomorrow could be 20 or ten! Point is! You take what, Charu sir, - gives you! - Please don't do this, I-- Charu, sir, I come all the way from Patiala, My boss will kill me. What will I tell him? I have small children. Alright. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to have my man Arvind here write you a beautiful letter to give to your boss man. No, it's going to be gorgeous, you wouldn't believe the la-de-da pretty crap that comes out of this guy's mouth sometimes. Astonishes me. I'm telling him all the time, "You talk too much." That's what I'll do. So just leave the merch here, we'll test it overnight. You come back tomorrow. And I'll give you the other fifteen. Pleasure doing business with you. Nice doing business with you also, sir. [Workers chattering] [machine whirring] [metal clanking] Hey! Yo, Smiley! Why is this piece of shit still here? Sir, owner called us, he's coming tomorrow, sir. Wasn't he supposed to get some big, fuck off spoilers so he could fly or something like that? What's he going to pay for this-- Nice interior! What a piece of shit! What am I running, a parking garage here? What? Siddarth Sinha wants to meet you tonight. [Indian themed music] [party music] Charu, sir. Charu, sir. - Fuck me in the ass! - [Siddarth chuckles] Look at you! Oh, very happy to see you, Charu sir. Hell, how long has it been? - It has been years! - Years! Look at you! You haven't aged. What did you do? Like, drink baby's blood or something? Arvind! Arvind! Come here, come here, come here. This cocksucker says that you tracked me down because, uh, you're looking to... to buy some metal from a few of my clients? Yes, yes, sir. Yeah. I'm sorry, I'm a little rude with what I said a moment before. - No, no. - You know? [Chuckles] - No, no. - Yeah, yeah. It's just the, the stench that is our business. You know, it's like-- the smell of just new money. Is something else, right? [Chuckles] - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - You, uh... Worry nothing, Charu sir, about anything. You have my life as guarantee. Alright, my brother! - Alright. - I pay your commission tonight! Cash! Hot damn! Alright, listen, Arvind, he doesn't trust people that well, you know? I do, but, personally, fuck him. I am inspired by your bear-like confidence! [Chuckles] Whoo! Alright, Arvind, why don't you two go do the thing, and, uh, go talk about the, huh, huh, huh. And go talk about the boom-boom-booms. It'll all be good! Be nice to our new friend, okay? Hey, listen, you want anything? - You want, you want a bottle? - No, no. - You need to get a table here? - No, no, I'm okay Charu. - You need anything, I will hook you up! - Yeah. I'm the man! Girls, where are you? [People chatter] [city noises] [crows cawing] [car beeping in the distance] [Prithvi grunts] [vehicle beeping] [workers chatter] Hmm? [Workers chatter] [workers chatter] Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Sid. [Dog barking] [glass shatters] [Nya cries] [soft lullaby music] Sid. [Sniffles] Don't worry about anything. I'll take care of everything. I trust you. [Lips smacking] [seat-belt unbuckling] [car door opens] - [gun fires] - [Suraj yelps] [light lullaby music] [phone ringing] [man talking on phone] Mm. [Soft eerie music] - [elevator dings] - [man chatters on speakerphone] [footsteps] [ambulance sirens in the distance] [man chatters on speakerphone] [bag rustles] [crows cawing] [dispatcher on radio] [cars beeping] [cow mooing] [city noises] [dialing phone] [party music] [men chatter] Hey! You! Sup? - What you doing? - Fuck off! Woah! Easy! Say, guys. Can you give us a little space here? Thank you. What? Don't remember me? Look at me! No. - No? - No. I'm Charu uncle. I'm your uncle Charlie! Wow. You're a real lady-killer, aren't ya? [Charu sighs] Arvind. You know that, uh... I used to... bounce this little, this little lady-killer here on my knee. I fed him ice-cream. He spit back in my eye. I probably had it coming. So, how are your brothers these days? I have nothing to do with my fucking family. That's amazing! That's the exact same thing I told that chick over there in that silver dress. Before she blew me. [Chuckles] It's been a long time. It's good to see you again. I don't even know who the fuck you are, man, I'm just-- Hey. Sit down. You know something? I can really help you with your brothers. Seriously. I could. You want to be my friend. - My friend! - Okay! Yeah? He's got balls. They're small right now, but he's got them. Easy, easy. Come by my shop sometime. Swing by. Crack open the hood. Take a look underneath. See how your engine is running, is it clean? Is it well-greased? Hell. I'll even throw in a pair of windshield wipers. You're going to need to know where you're going! Alright. Atta boy! Oh, one more thing. Fuck you, too. Ladies. - [Man shouting] - [machines whirring] [electricity sparking] I need partner like you to strike fire with. Charu, sir. I bring the matches. All my client and family name. You and I together make biggest partnership in North India. Oh. [Sighs] I don't know if this is for you, Sid. It's a lot of baggage bringing family into this business. Oh. No, no, no! Charu, sir! I don't like it. It's not good for my health. There's a reason why you don't see me with the doting wife and little Charus running around the place. [Grunts] [door opens] [door closes] [light flicks on] [gun fires] [gun cocks] [gun cocks and fires] - [crickets chirping] - [birds singing] [Bunny] Okay? One, two, three! [Grunts] [crows cawing] [fire crackles] [people chattering in the distance] [metal clanking] [workers chattering] Have you ever held a gun before? I'm not here for guns, Charu sir. I'm not an assassin or a hitman. I don't like killing people. I just need you to help me. Hey. Inspector, Raghav. Suraj. Hey, Officer. [People chatter] Hi! Um, Nya. Nya? Hi, Nya! May I? Sure. Hi! Hello. Yeah? What a big girl you are! Mmmm, mmm, mmm! [Raghav chuckles] - [Nya cooing] - Oh! Sujata! Thank you. [Nya cooing] [ambulance siren] [workers chatter] [metal clanking] Got rid of him. Just a token of dedication and loyalty to you. So, now... you and I, equal partner. Charu. Charlie. Hmm? Everything you and I sell, We go fifty-fifty. I will bring you business, hmm? That will... stagger your... fucking mind. You... you... you... you are a great man! [Lips smacking] Ergh! [Dramatic music] What about that punky kid brother of yours? Oh, oh. I will take care of him. Soon enough, yeah. - Yeah? - Hmm. Yeah, we have to look after our business interest also. [Dramatic music] [cocks gun] [workers chatter] [phone dinging] [phone clicks open] Go. [Phone clicks off] [door opens] [door closes] [elevator dings] [doors open] Arvind! Kid. Good to see ya. You. Sit down. [Soft dramatic music] I'm going to need a little one on one time with the boy. Now. - But, I-- - You what? Look, it's a room full of women. Go get some pussy, will ya? Drink. Drink. Good. What is it with people, you know? It's like they're always wearing masks. Right? I got one, you got one, everybody's got a mask on. But every now and then it slips a little bit and you can see behind it. And you find out who they really are. I've seen behind your brother's mask. The outside's a bully, but behind it... coward. [Phone clicks] [Charu] I'm not helping you because I... could give a shit about sympathy, or because I have a bleeding heart, or because I want to help you avenge your dead girlfriend, which was fucked up, by the way. I just... I want to be able to... just to wear my mask. I can help you set this thing up. If you get in trouble, I am no help to you. If you get your brains blown out, I will not shed a single tear, just cause that's the kind of motherfucker I am. But... the good news is... if you do this thing right, you never have to do it again. And then you get anything you want. You in? Or out? I'm not afraid. Hmm. [Glass clanks] [door knocks] [Charu] Buck up! This is Arun. [Door closes] He will be playing the waiter. You better give him a good tip, lady-killer, if you know what's good for you. - Boom! - [Arun laughs] Why are you still here? Come! Come, come, come! - Understood? - Yes, sir. Don't forget to switch it on. Don't worry. Just... have some confidence, don't be so nervous. We need a full confession, okay? Yes, sir. Good luck. [Door opens] [soft dramatic music] Huh? [City noises] Yes, sir. [Dance music on radio] [waiter] Hello, sir. What can get, sir? [Siddarth] Uh... [on wire] Butter Chicken. Jeera rice. Medium masala. With all the pleasures of the world, sir. And you, sir? Saag paneer and butter naan. Oh, sorry, sir, actually we out of the saag paneer tonight. Why don't you try, uh, fish with the rice. Basmati. [Police officer] Undercover officers in position. Be careful. Suraj doesn't know who you are. And it will come with the soup, sir. Today, manager's Happy Birthday, sir. Is that okay, sir? [Kisses teeth] It'll take just four minutes, sir. On the way, sir. It's coming. [Soft dramatic music] Your soup, sir. Your butter chicken masala. Medium masala, I think? - And your sou-- - Hey! Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir, my hand is slippery. Sorry, sir. You don't pay, sir. Sorry, sir! Hundred times sorry, sir! [Dramatic music] Quick. Get rid of him. [Dog barking] Drop all exits, we're coming in. Make sure Siddarth is not with Suraj! I repeat, no shots fired. No shots fired! [Dog barking] [sirens wailing] [man chuckling] [all shouting] - [all shouting] - Suraj. [Guns firing] [all shouting] [gun firing] [man chattering on radio] [wife] Raghav? Raghav! Yes, my love. Eggs or a kiss? - Oh, eggs can wait. - [Chuckles] Muah! Raghav! [Door closes] Well done, Officer. - Terrific work. - Thank you, sir. Looks like Bates wants to take you back to the U.K. [chuckles] I'm quite happy with my salary here, sir. Um, if you'll excuse me? - [Daniel] Please. - Thank you. [Buzzer rings in the distance] - [buzzer rings] - [door opens] Good to see you, Suraj. [Door closes] I hope they're treating you well. [Gentle music] Put your phone away. You've helped us, Suraj. You have my word. Okay. [Camera clicks] Can I see Nya? [Sighs] That was your brother Siddarth's pet name for his mistress of ten years. And she set him up to butcher Prithvi. We got him. He's confessed to the crime. Thank you. Can you please give us a moment? We knew Siddarth had an obsession with weapons. [Raghav] With your father gone, he got his chance. [Dramatic music] Prithvi paid off Charu, and made a deal with him to protect you from Siddarth. He bought his loyalty. He set up a meeting with you and Charu. [Dialing phone] [Raghav] But after Siddarth killed your brother, Charu realized he was out of control. So he set you up to get rid of Siddarth. There is one more thing about Prithvi you need to know. Siddarth is not her father. Prithvi is. She's on twenty-four hour suicide watch. Nya is with her sister. [Raghav] No one wants ties with your family, Suraj. I have a request. Uh. I don't know if it's in my place to ask you this. You see, my wife and I, we are... unable to conceive. And I was wondering if... we could take Nya to our home. And I... want to get your permission for the adoption. [Dramatic music intensifying] [soft acoustic guitar music]
