Hi, everybody! This is your cousin Brucie! Yeah. And now, cousins, live from the Brooklyn Paramount, it's my pleasure to present what you've all been waiting for, the number-one group in America... The Dukes! /n 1963, we were on top of the world. Times change. ♪ Bum-bum, bum-bum, bum-bum ♪ ♪ Bum-bum, bum-bum ♪ ♪ Ooh-wah, ooh-wah, cool, cool kitty ♪ ♪ Tell us about the boy from New York City ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Ooh-wah, ooh-wah, come on, kitty ♪ ♪ Tell us about the boy from New York City ♪ ♪ He's kind of tall ♪ You think this is just one guy? Zorro? Who knows? We made the whole thing up. So you... Y-you never got robbed. No, we just said we did. I don't get it. Why would you do something like that? Why do you think? They did it to bring in some business... ldiot. Just look for the story, all right? Zorro. "Food bandit strikes again," that kind of thing. ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ L don't understand. It was supposed to run today. ♪ You ought to come and see ♪ lt's not here. It's got to be. Look in the restaurant reviews. Maybe they put it in there. It's not gonna be in the restaurant reviews. That's to review! This is news! You know, it's about a restaurant. Logically, it'll be in the "restaurant" section. Logically... Only to your spider's brain. There is no "restaurant" section, George. Well, you know what? Then it's not there. That's what l just said. He's absolutely right. It's not here. Wait, wait, listen to this. This is interesting. "Food chemist. Leading supermarket chain seeks chemist with background in food technology. In additional to beautiful surroundings..." Murph. "We offer competitive salary..." Murph. "And..." Murph! - What? - Your paper's on fire. l was just trying to help. Murph, we're not looking for jobs. We're looking for money. I thought we were looking for the story. We were till you lit his paper on fire. l knew it was you. You believe him? It wasn't me. lt wasn't. You know, the smart thing would be to start our own. Stop with that. What? l think it's a good idea. And how do we finance this good idea? We get a loan. We ask Lou to get us a loan. Lou... can't even get us a gig. By the way, Lou is working on some things. Yeah, right. With our personalities, l think it'll work out. No, l think he is. He got some things. They don't want personalities. They want collateral. What things? I don't know. I wasn't paying attention. But l heard him say he's working on some things. Yeah, well, the oven and the equipment is collateral. They already own that. They want outside collateral, something you already got. Well, wait a minute, you buy a car, right? You know, it's collateral, then you repossess it. That's because a car is easy to sell. Not too many people drive ovens, George. I think you're very negative. I'm not being negative. I'm realistic. All right, do me a favor. Don't turn around. I think she likes my smile. - She's right up your alley. - Yeah. l'd like to wake up with that. I like if they turn into a pizza, like, about 2:00 in the morning. Can't argue with that. Pizza's always good. How much do you need to open a restaurant? - 80 grand all-in, baby. - That's 20 grand each. If any one of us had 20 grand, we wouldn't be having this conversation. - L have 20. - That's thousand, Murph. I know what it is. I have 20,000. Where did you get 20 grand? I sold my stock options. They paid me yesterday. Great. You can be the first money in. That's the hardest money to come by. Can't. l need it for the lawyer. How much is he charging? $1 5,000 retainer. You're throwing the money away. It's a scam. You're not gonna get your job back. I wasn't smoking! That test was false! If you walk into the room and everybody, let's say, is smoking grass, you breathe. That's it... boom, you're positive. Did the plane crash, or did the plane crash? The plane didn't crash! It skidded off the runway on takeoff. Yeah, when the wheel came off because it wasn't on right. I'm not working on wheels! I'm a troubleshooter for the electrical system! And l'm the best! The vice president of the airline gave me this ohmmeter key chain for my birthday last year! You know how many guys we take care of those planes you fly in? They put all their money in security now. Today, nobody cares about maintenance anymore. Yeah, well, they got the big guns, Murph. You'll lose. Well, excuse me, boys, but it's... lt's pizza time. Isn't she too small for you? Excuse me, boys. l think she just ran over my foot. We better get to the emergency. Yeah? Call Lou. Check, please! ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, whee ♪ You remember when Bobby Vinton did that promotion for Time Life Records? You got us a deal promoting Time Life Records? Better... they're gonna use a song of The Dukes to promote this thing called, Dance Heads. - Dance Heads? - Yeah. They're gonna put you on TV, 30-second spots. I feel like an ice cream. You guys want ice cream? What the hell is wrong with you? When are you gonna learn... When they take off your leg? How's a guy like me supposed to not have ice cream? It's no joke, Armond. Your foot's in jeopardy. Okay? You got to be strong. As long as l shoot my insulin, l'm good for a couple of scoops. Tell that to your two missing toes. They pay for everything... Production, air time, and they're gonna take out an 800 number to order your song. Lou, we only had a couple of hits, and they can download them free. No, not... not with a nice jacket and story about The Dukes. They get that for nothing with the CD, and it only costs us 30 cents. So we lose money. No, this is the beauty of the thing. We charge $4.95 shipping and handling, it only costs us $1 .05 to ship. Yeah? $4.95 take away $1 .05. Yeah? - That's $3.95. - Right. Minus 30 cents for the CD. Yeah. We keep, in our pocket, $3.60... that's per unit. Wow. Yeah. All right. And what do they get out of it? We help them sell their Dance Heads. That's all they get. What the hell is this Dance Heads? It's a video thing... lip sync. All you got to do is show up. You have such a nice complexion. You won't need much makeup. That's unfortunate. I was hoping that you, could spend a little more time with me. - Phil, how long? - About 1 0 minutes. Good. You know, Armond used to open for The Dukes. - Funniest stand-up around. - Good. He could do a short routine and then introduce them. Maybe next time, Lou. You know, l don't want anything to detract from the promotion. You never know, a little laughter may soften their pockets. Not necessary. People see this, the phones will be ringing off the hook. We'll have laughs later, okay? Lou. Lou, l mean, do you really think this is something we should be doing? They got 8 million viewers on KCLA. That's... if we get 1 %, that's 288,000. They think we can get as much as 1 5%. That's 4,320,000 for us. Okay. Danny! Danny, what time are we meeting tonight? For what? What do you mean, "meeting"? You know, skeet shooting. We're supposed to go skeet shooting. What skeet shooting? What are you talking about, skeet shooting? Skeet shooting... Did you forget? That's right. I'm s... you know, l'm sorry, George. I forgot. Right, okay. Skeet shooting. That's about 3:00. 3:00. 3:00 A.M. 3:00 A.M. All right. See, that's what l thought.

L don't know. They got the air time. You know, that's good. That's good? That's better than good. All we got to is make 1 %, and we can do anything we want. You know? l mean, that don't sound too hard. It sounds too easy. That's what's bothering me. Why does that bother you? Why can't it be true? 'Cause when you're desperate, nothing sounds true. Whoa. Whoa. Wait a minute. Whoa. Wait a minute. What? Come, on Danny, look at this. What? Look at this. Come here. What? I'm telling you, we can set some tables over there, you know, serve something like pasta. - This? - Yeah. It looks like the Knights of Columbus left it to rot, George. Danny, we can get this place cheap. There's no restaurants around here. You ever think there might be a reason for that? I'm telling you. lt's worth a call. You got your phone? No, l don't have the phone. Well, then remember the number, then. George, we don't have any money. We can ask Aunt Vee for the money. What is... what do you mean, "Ask Aunt Vee"? We can tell her we're making the money on the promo stuff, right? And we can pay her back. I mean, l don't want to lose this place. Lose what?! Nobody wants this! - Danny... - You want this? Nobody wants it. Danny, for one time, will you just listen to me? I already owe her money. Then l'll ask her. Good. You ask her. L got detectives coming by and busting chops! Reporters! "Eye on L.A." wants to talk to me! What the hell am l gonna say to them? Two geniuses l got here! What the hell are you saying? Take that damn thing off your face! I says... l just said the "Eye on L.A." could be a good thing. It's publicity for the restaurant. What publicity? The only good publicity is word of mouth, and l got enough to do around here without talking about my lying nephews! L'll talk to them. Don't do me no favors, you! - Come on, Aunt Vee. - L don't want you to talk to them! We figured this guy is grabbing all the publicity. Look at all the joints he's hit... They're doing great. I mean, everybody wants to know where Zorro sat, where he carved his famous "Z." Yeah, that's another thing! You see what yous done to my damn painting? Can't believe it. Maybe you should ask her for the loan now. Smart. Which one of you clowns did this? Which one of you? It was your idea wasn't it? Wasn't it? I don't remember. Well, who cut it? You know how long l had this painting? This is an original. This is no litho. You see this signature? That's real paint. We did it for you, Aunt Vee. All these mom-and-pop joints... They're going down the toilet. Yeah, we figure we got some fresh ideas, you know, but you don't want to hear them. You know, the only people that come here, you know, they split the order. We don't want to see the restaurant go under. You trying to teach me how to run a restaurant now? No, l don't want to tell you how to run a restaurant, no. - Lt's just l... - Just... just some changes. You know, keep up with the times. That's it. I was in this business when your mother and your mother brought you to the restaurant in Long lsland in high chairs! Yeah, that's right, the high chairs. And now you come 'round to my place, why? Not because you're great chefs, no. Not because l need yous. But because your own things went through for you, over and over! You throw that in the garbage! What is it, Katherine? Pasta to share. Get the sauce, George. Hurry up. L'll get the sauce. Give me a minute. They don't like it anyway, so why should l give it to them? Hey, hey, hey. Come here. All right? "Restaurant." "Restaurant" section. Okay, big shot? "Restaurant" section. We never should have left New York. L mean, look at Johnny Maestro. He still packs them in every night, you know, at his own club. What l wouldn't give to have our own club. Lt would be great to have a club, but it could never happen here. Why not? Different crowd. They don't like oldies as much. That's what l'm saying... We never should have left New York. What are you, a crystal ball? Look, Georgie, we did good here for a long time. Yeah, until you and Ray had that thing. What does that have to do with New York? Well, what l'm saying is, you know, we never should have left. Yeah, but then l-l-l wouldn't have had Brion. Ever think about that? - Sure you would. - How? Well, you would have met somebody else, and, you know, your kid would have been another kid. I don't want another kid. This is my kid. Look, he still would have been your kid, but some other kid, you know? Not this kid. See what l'm saying? No, Brion is my kid. I don't want another kid. He'd still be named Brion if you want, but he'd be a different Brion, because you'd have a different wife. George, take some medicine, will you? Yeah. What's wrong? Let's go. What's wrong, Georgie? I think l just swallowed my tooth. Yeah, you did. - Come on, we got to go. - Where? To the dentist, that's where! We got to get this fixed! Listen to me... I can't even talk right! George, how? We owe the guy money. He's got to do this, Danny! He's gonna want something up front. Come on, let's go! Will you relax? All right? It's not like you lost a limb. It's not about my tooth! It's about my smile! Let's go! Get! God, George, where will we get the money? Come on! - Murph. - Hey! I need a big favor. It's really important, l swear. - Why are you talking like that? - L lost my tooth. He swallowed it eating a hot dog. Look, the "Dance Head" commercial is on tonight, and all we got to get is 1 %, and we can make a big score. It looks real good for us, Murph. I mean, there would have to be an earthquake and the TV station would have to blow up for us not to make any money. That's great. What do you need? I need you lend me some money to get my tooth fixed. I promise l'll pay you back. I would if l could, but l don't have it anymore. - Come on, Murph. - L swear. l invested it. In what? You don't know anybody to invest. l can't tell you yet. It's really big. Come on, Danny, let's go. Wait. Here. I have $1 26. It's all l have. Maybe this will help. You know, it's something, George. At least it shows good faith. Thanks, Murph. Michelle, l have to call you back. Okay. Dr. Phoul's office. One moment, please. Dr. Phoul, it's Dr. Brillstein on line 2. Okay. Why don't you step around here for a sec. Okay. Let me have your finger. Put some pressure on that. It's got to set. - Okay. - Just keep the pressure on. L'll be right back in. Marty, what's the good word? No, you call that a bargain? Marty, listen to me. We just bought 560 ounces of the same gold a couple of days ago and paid a full 25% less. You're very beautiful. Thank you. You just got to put on a little weight. Well, if you find that hard to believe, then go to the lab, look in the safe, weigh it, and then call Panda and tell him l want him to show you the invoice. Absolutely.

Come see us at any of our new locations, or we'll come see you at your next special event and make you the star you've always wanted to be. Come see us. Surf's up! Duh. So call Dance Heads. 1-800-446-321 1. That's Dance Heads. Just show up. We do the rest. Songs by The Dukes sold separately. We get no calls, and this guy gets everything! He used us to push his Dance Heads! How the hell did this happen, Lou? - What did the contract say? - Yeah, maybe we can sue. Come on, it costs money to sue! We didn't go to contract yet. We had... we had a deal memo and a handshake. - Okay, what did you agree to? - What l told you. Well, did you agree he can make our number real small at the end? - No, of course not. - So he shermed you. Shermy-sherm-sherm, sherm-sherm. You don't need to insult me. I'm trying the best l can to get jobs for you guys. And in this climate, it is not easy. What does climate have to do with it? The weather out here is great. All the outdoor venues, it should be easier. What planet are you on, buddy? - "Climate" as in "work climate." - Whoa! Come on, don't start with that "bigger group, more hit" crap, please. But that's what's happening! They take gigs today they wouldn't take five years ago. It's happening with actors, too. I had a great gig for... For Armond, series regular. I don't want to mention any names, but who comes in and takes it away from him at the last minute? A big star. Danny Devito. Really? What show was that? - Some show... it doesn't matter. - But l'm curious. - Lt doesn't matter. - But what was it? - Lou! - Lt never got picked up. Anyway, it's all changed now. Whole playing field is different. With today's technology, everybody's an actor, everybody's a singer. Yeah, there's... there's just too much competition. All those frigging reality shows. Lou, what about some of the old places we toured, you know, Disneyland, Six Flags... Why can't you book some of them? I would like nothing better. Yeah, like Knott's Berry Farm, where you trashed the sound system? What about the state fair, where you threw the speakers off the stage? How about the booker at the Hyatt Hotel, where you told him to stick the microphone in not a nice place. Guys, you know, l just wanted us to sound the best we could. They're right, Danny. Your temperament did us no good. Well, that won't happen anymore, Lou, l promise. Okay. Maybe if all the Dukes were together, instead of hiring some impostors to fill in, we could use that to book you. - Well, that's not gonna happen. - Danny already reached out for him. If you were together, you could help each other, but your... your egos got in the way. It's Ray with the ego. Yeah, he wouldn't even return phone calls. Danny's the voice, not Ray. Just get us moving again. Whatever you say, l'll do. Do l have your word? You have my word. l mean, look at this... The color's off. - How long will it last? - L don't know. He said, "Don't eat anything too hot, too cold, too hard." l guess that's why they call it a temp. You know, the best ones are these da Vinci veneers. They give you the movie-star smile. - Da Vinci? - Yeah. Guy thought of everything. When am l ever gonna get a permanent one? What about Brion? When do l get his teeth fixed? You know, Danny, maybe we should sell this limo, you know, get something more economical. Come on, George. It's all we have left. This limo's been through everything with us. L'll find another way. Eats a lot of gas. It's better than being cramped in a roller skate. Yeah, maybe you're right. How's Armond gonna get into one of those things? Speaking of which, if he doesn't keep his treatments, they're gonna saw that foot right off. I mean, is this medicine? I mean, this is a sin. Do these guys take an oath? Yeah, they swear loyalty to cash. You know how much money we gave this guy over the years? You know what they do, these dentists? They get together and they all chip in to buy the cheapest price on gold. They buy it in bulk. Imagine that. Who told you that? I overheard Dr. Phoul on the phone. They just bought 560 ounces. 560 ounces? That's a lot of rappers' teeth. You know the money they must make? They all chip in? Yeah, they buy the gold, and they put it in a lab where the crowns are made. - They put it in a lab? - Yeah. We should have been dentists. Yeah. THE FOOD BANDlT STRlKES AGAlN Bastardi! Danny, this is it. We got nowhere to turn. I mean, how hard could it be? I mean, there's... There's nobody there at night. We're not gonna hurt anybody. Well, that's for sure, because we're not doing it. What do you got against it? What do l got against it? We're not thieves, that's what. No, but they are. They rob you every time you sit in the chair... every time! Well, it's not the same thing, George. Okay? You got to stop with this, okay? Danny, l'm not gonna let this go. Daddy, can l have cotton candy? Please? Brion, it's no good for your teeth, honey. Come on, give the kid some cotton candy. - Lt's no good for his teeth! - He's 9 years old! You should know better than anybody! Come on. You know what? Go out for a pass. Hi, Mom. Hi, Brad. - Hey, buddy. - Hey, sweetheart. Did you have fun? - Yeah. - Yeah? Look what Dad got me. Wow. P.J. just got here. - You could show him. - Okay. - Hey, P.J., look at this. - Danny, this is Brad. Hey, Dan. Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. So, l understand you and Brion like to fish. What do you go for? Well, pretty much anything we can get off the pier. Well, why don't we all get together and go for some barracuda? I got a 32-footer, all power. All you got to say is the word. Thanks. l'll think about it. Right. You want something to eat... A hot dog, a hamburger? You know what? l'll... L'll take a hamburger. A hamburger, okay. What do you take on it? - Just a little ketchup. - Okay. So... You like this one? He's... he's interesting. Gets along with Brion. I'm not gonna give you the third degree, as long as he's a nice person. He is. Good. So, what's he do? He's a dentist. He's gonna fix Brion's teeth. Brion's got a dentist. But we owe him a lot of money. - L said l'll take care of it. - When, Danny? - Soon. - Well, that's too far away. We need it now, and Brad will do it now. Don't you understand? Those are my teeth. L'll fix them, not this clown. - This "clown" has a good business. - He's a thief! Danny, what are you talking about? He doesn't touch those teeth. L'll get them fixed. Danny! The whole $1 0,000? He said it was too heavy to take with him. The cops seized it all... The money, marijuana. He had to climb the fence to get away. - Who is this guy? - The Russian Mafia. - You just got shermed. - What is "shermed"? You're a mark. There were no cops. There was no bust. He kept your money. How do you know that? Italian wise guys used to run that scam. You sure he's Russian Mafia? Of course l'm sure. They stop by the newsstand all the time. What do l do, Danny? You can start by throwing up. It'll make you feel better. Shut up! It's not funny, Armond! Lou! You knew he was a gangster, a common thief. You should have had no part of him. This is what happens. I know, l know. But what do l do now, guys? Come with me and get ashes. That'll make you feel better. - You think so? - L know so. It will, Murph. We all got them. I mean, l feel great. Okay, l'll... l'll go. Good. Make you feel like a new man. - Talk to you later, Lou. - Yeah, right. Danny. - Danny! - Yeah? Danny, Danny, listen. I want to take him with us. - Take him where? - You know. - Armond. - Armond already knows. Yeah, it's interesting. Yeah, well, so's an autopsy, but l wouldn't want one. - We got to bring Sinitsky with us. - Will you stop with this? There's gonna be electricity there. We're gonna need him. - Who's Sinitsky? - Murph. I never heard you call him that. - That's because l never do. - Murphy's law. Whatever can go wrong, will. That's a good name for him. Danny, the guy's always been there for me, and he needs money just like all of us. Well, he doesn't need to get busted, because that's what would happen before we even got in the front door. No, we won't. Tell him, Armond. Tell me what? Armond's got this guy. He's a master thief. Tell him. I worked with this guy on a heist movie. He was the tech advisor. He retired now. But he told me that he can open up any safe around. - Any safe! - Let me get this right. You want to break into a building with a guy we don't even know. He's just gonna show us how to do it. He won't go in. He's done too much time. - And he's gonna show us? - Yeah. lt's Aunt Vee! Aunt Vee! Hurry up. Finish up, okay? Come on. We should have been done already. And where's Katherine? Where's Katherine? I don't see her car out there. She's probably late. My God, but you're brilliant! How did you get so smart? We get it from you, Aunt Vee. You like how l prepped the kitchen? Yeah, you're a regular Emeril Lagasse. But how come you's not finished in here yet? Some ad agency saw the Dance Head promotion, and it reminded them of us. Yeah, they want us to sing one of our songs. That's terrific. It doesn't answer my question. - Well, we had to go meet with them. - That's why we're late. So that's why you's not finished in here yet. - Exactly. - Exactly. Morons. One night l got two parties, everybody's late. I can't stand this traffic anymore. I want to move. Yeah, well before you go, can you help Martha Stewart here with the table settings? Hey. l heard about your tooth. I'm sorry. Well, you didn't do it. Nothing to be sorry about. I just want you to know l still think you have a great smile. I know. l'm willing to risk it. So am l. Gives us some hope. That's the spirit! I gave Lou my word, and l'm gonna keep it. What does he have to do with it? Well, he set the whole thing up. It's because of him we got a shot. He doesn't know anything about it. How can he not know about it? He was there when we met the guys. I'm talking about the heist, Danny, not the commercial. Come on, it's a thousand-to-one shot that commercial will even be aired, okay? We got to start thinking about plan "B" here. You want to know the truth, George? I think about it, okay? Good. And every time l do, my... my... my palms get sweaty and my heart starts to race. Yeah, well, l'm scared, too. So is Armond. Brain damage, wake up! He can't even walk! He can walk when he wants to. We need a lookout. He can sit in the car with a walkie-talkie, okay? And what's he gonna say? "The cops are coming. Jump in the safe"? Look, l'll tell you what. We meet with the guy. If you don't like it, we walk away. What about Aunt Vee? It would break her heart if she ever found out. She'll never know about it. You hope. Toulio, we're here! It's me! Who? Armond!

Man. - You didn't tell him? - What's wrong with you? Armond, you're not trying to put me in a jackpot here, are you, bro? No, Toulio. Come on, l swear. I didn't want to talk over the phone, so l said it was a film. I didn't know what else to say. I don't do that stuff no more. I'm legit now. I got a wife and a dog. I even make car payments. Sorry to bother you, Toulio. Come on guys. Sorry, Toulio. Yeah, no problem. I just don't, you know? Come on, guys! Say not for nothing, but how many scores have you guys put down? None. Man, you guys lead a clean life. Why do you want to start playing this game at your age? It's a long story, Toulio, and a very bad idea. Come on guys, let's go. How much are you taking down? 35 pounds of gold. 35 pounds? It's just sitting there. You guys cops? - No! - No, we're not cops! I fix 747s, and you know who these guys used to be.

Okay, which one does it look like? Danny knows. I don't know. Did you see the gold? Some of it. Well, then why can't you pick out the safe? I had no reason to. I was never in this business.

L'll show you everything. It's got to be one of these safes, and l'll show you how to pop them all. Agreed? Danny, Danny, come on. What do you think? - L'm still thinking. - Well, what else have we got? Our freedom, number one. Number two, we could get shot. Good, let them put me in a bag and bury me, because l can't even afford a box! I never got to number three. There's still a chance the commercial could work. If it does, we'll be okay. This is what you think we do, make these junk commercials? Listen, son, we don't do these things. Do you understand? No, l asked you a question. Do you understand? Do you know who we are, where we toured? I played cards backstage with more legends than you ever watched on TV. We had hit songs when you weren't allowed to cross the street by yourself, and you want to tell us how to sing, how to record this? What? No, Lou, l'm sorry. That's it. l can't do it. No. Yeah, that's the way it is. I'm sorry, we're gone. Gone. Let's go guys. What? Temperament? You want to see temperament? You want to see speakers fly off the stage?

Just the materials? Yeah, you know, ballpark figure. We go to Home Depot, get the materials. We get paint, tools, wood. Tools are expensive, but if we rent them, it could cost us like around 7, 9 grand. What are you doing? George, how much to get your tooth fixed, not with that crook? You know, you go to a clinic, get it done right. How much? I don't know. I could do it for $600. Okay, there. Thanks, Danny. Armond, how much is your insurance? Since l didn't earn enough, about $300 a month. Would you be all right with two months? What am l gonna do after that? Aunt Vee gave us 75% of the restaurant. We'll make it work for all of us. Give me two months. Attaboy. L'll take $600 for Brion's teeth, and l'll give Murph... L'll give you 600 bucks? No, no, no. Give me $200. - You sure? - Yeah, stupid parking ticket. That's the spirit.

He's gonna eat us into bankruptcy. No, he's just bringing us some stuff we need. Hey, thanks, Danny. Thanks. - That's Armond. - L'll get it. Good night, George. Good night. George? George! What the hell is going on? - Put up your pants! - My pants? Up! Up! He means your hands. You paisano? - Depasquale. - Depasquale? No, l'm Zucco. Zucco. - Easy, Pop. - What the hell's the matter with you, Pop? You're gonna hurt somebody with that. Not with this he can't. It's plastic. Plastic?! Are you nuts?! We got no money here! Hey, he can't understand you. Wait a minute. Zorro? Si. Zorro. Can you believe this? What is he saying? All l got is "police" and "life." No, he said that, to go ahead and call the police. He doesn't care anymore. His life is over anyway. Katherine, l didn't know you speak ltalian. We all have our secrets, George. Okay, he said he worked his whole life, and he lost his job. His wife got sick last year. And he lost all of his savings. She died. L'll get him a drink. He never took money, only food from the kitchen. They embellished the whole thing. Especially you. What's wrong? He says there's too much garlic, not enough oregano, and the pasta's way too mushy. What did he say? What did you ask him? That better be Armond. Very good. We got a chef. Salute. Salute! Yo, George, come on, give us a hand. There's a ton of stuff in the truck. Danny, we got big problems. There's a guy inside. - He wants to talk to us. - About what? A certain thing. You know. Ray. I heard you're looking for a singer. It's been too long. And l can get some of our old band members... if you want. Let's put on a show. It's good to see you, Lou. You sneaky bastards.

Who's the proprietor here? What? We are. ABC Board. We're closing you down. Wait a minute. What does that mean? What's going on? It means you didn't renew your liquor license. It means you got a hefty fine coming. Hold on, that's a total misunderstanding. Our aunt owns this place. And she got sick, and she forgot to tell us about the renewal. - Lt's a misunderstanding, guys. - All right! Tell it to the state board when you appear before them. The date is on this summons. Man. Geez. You know, let us do one song for my kid, please? He's right over there. Just one song. I'm sorry. No. - One song for my kid, please? - Hey, l can't help you. Hey, cheech, chooch! Let them play one song. What would it hurt? I'm gonna have to ask everybody to vacate the premises. - What's going on here? - Now, sir! - You're not serious, are you? - Who are you?! Get out! - Let's go. Everybody. - Come on, let's go. Everyone. L'm gonna call a lawyer. I'm gonna call two frigging lawyers. I got two frigging lawyers l'm gonna call. You know, no matter what, it's good to see you guys again. I really mean that. We got a lot to talk about, Ray? Yeah. We got stories that'll make your hair stand up. I got some stories, too. Hey, it's not like we're through. You guys are great. We got a setback, that's all. Yeah, we have terrific food. Yeah, so terrific l'm putting on some weight. Can you tell? Come on, Katherine. You could eat a horse, nobody would notice. Nobody gonna answer that?! Aunt Vee! Look at this. Hey, did the doctor say you could be up already? I'm not going anyplace yet. You guys did some job. I'm impressed! You're not upset? I'm upset with myself for not reminding yous about the license! I'm gonna give you the money, so now go take care of it! - Hey, hey! - All right! All right! Hey, Ray! It's great to have you back! You too, Aunt Vee. You look great. Boy, l wish l had her genes. You're in the newspaper! Listen to this headline... "Let them sing just one song." - ls that the Times? - Yes. "That's all this reporter asked last Friday night when the state ABC Board acted in a Gestapo manner for a mere technicality, depriving my wife and myself of an evening with The Dukes." Give me that. This could be good publicity. That's great. He talks about nostalgia, about an oldies club... He's one guy. One guy with a newspaper column... Danny. Why are you so negative? I'm not negative. I'm realistic. You better go down and pay that license tomorrow, 'cause if it goes on like this you're gonna have to do a second show. The answering machine's loaded. I just took two reservations. The first one was for 1 0. The second one's for 17. Do you believe this? - Come on, we're back in business! - L will drink to that. I'm gonna have a big drink. Let's drink up! Some Patron now! Doo Wop Cafe. l hate small portions. The other day l go to a restaurant. I order filet mignon. The waiter brings it to me. Five minutes later, he comes back. He goes, "Sir, how did you find your steak?" l said, "By accident! I moved a French fry, and it was sitting there!" lt wasn't big enough to cut with a knife. I tried to swallow it whole... It got caught in my windpipe! It took 40 people to give me the Heimlich maneuver. One person joined in, he thought it was Hands Across America. Thank you. We got some celebrities here tonight. Put your hands together right over here for Chuck and Bob from The Regents! Stand up, take a bow, guys! Great rock-'n'-roll band. And l want to mention right now columnist Harry Basil. If it wasn't for his column a lot of you people wouldn't be here tonight! Thank you, Harry. Well, without further ado, let's hear it for one of the greatest vocal groups of the '60s...
