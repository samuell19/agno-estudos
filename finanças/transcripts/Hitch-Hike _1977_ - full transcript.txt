HITCH-HIKE Someone has to be sober to get us back. Right... Keep on like that and you'll be drunk before dark. Really ? I hope so ! You know what ? I had your head in my gunsight before, for at least half a minute. You're disgusting ! But Eve didn't go "boom", you know why ? I saw the stag and said to myself: "Wonder if Eve's sweet meat roasted is better than the stag's ?" Who knows ! But I'm sure the stag doesn't fuck like you do ! No one fucks like my little Eve. That's the only reason you're not in its place. Hey ! What's happening ? Did I frighten you ? Did I frighten you ? You reek of whiskey, you're disgusting ! California Chianti... you haven't put it in cans yet ? You didn't think of that, did you ? That's a damn fine piece of animal, Mr. Mancini. Sure wish I'd shot him ! What's so funny ? Imagine my wife roasting there instead of that piece of meat. Your wife ? That thing has something my wife wishes she had. Oh yeah, what's that ? That spit up her ass ! Excuse me, I'll see if my sweetie's ready to join us. I've never met an Italian who could hold his booze. Harry, it won't go this far ! For God's sake Lucy, that rope goes there ! You've put this tent up a million times. - That's why I prefer trailers. - That's why trailers cost more, too. If the tent doesn't kill you, come to our going-away dinner. - My wife and I leave tomorrow. - Very kind, thanks. I'm Stetson, insurance man. - My wife, Lucy. - Hello ! Great pleasure, Mr. Stetson. My name is... if you just wait a minute... I know my own name... It's on the tip of my tongue... Christ ! Someone just called my name a minute ago... It's nothing, these things happen... What do you mean it's nothing ? I can't remember my name ! I'll ask my wife. Come, come along with me. Eve ! Come along ! Eve ! Eve ! Eve, meet a couple of friends. Mr. and Mrs. Stetson, Eve, my wife. Hello. Eve, tell these people my name, I can't remember it. - Get in and shut the door. - Sorry. I really can't remember it. You're hopeless, Walter. - The spit's waiting for you. - I must get dressed. Sober up, there's some fresh coffee. I don't want fucking coffee, 1 want you ! You're disgusting ! I thought you liked it... No, I don't feel like it. You always feel like it... my little chicken. - You're an animal ! - You're a whore ! - A big whore ! - You're a pig ! - And you like pigs ! - Get off of me ! Yeah, like that... Hey... now what's the matter ? - I'm tired. - Come on... Look. Don't melt, darling. They're doing what we did before. You're wrong, darling. They're making love, we just screw. You can't tell the difference, darling. Go fuck yourself, darling. If that's an invitation, I'm sorry, I'm all dried out. Wait a second ! Where are you going ? - I think it's broken. - What ? - My wrist. - No, it's nothing. Goddamn tent ! There's never been a tent here before. Who's the goddamn idiot who put it here ? Who ?! The insurance man... Did you insure yourself ? Of course I'm insured. What happened ? The insurance man is insured. My hand will cost you more than a new one. I'm a basketball player, and I'm worth a lot ! - I'll ruin you ! - But I assure you... - Stop assuring, insurance asshole. - Stop it ! Don't pay any attention to him, Mr. Stetson, he's drunk. And he's not a basketball player, he's a reporter. And as such his value is like that of a Minor League reserve. Goddamn American doctor, nearly put my whole arm in a cast. A police office was wounded in the holdup, as of now we have no news on his condition... My head's exploding. It hurts more than last night. - Talking to me ? - Didn't you ask about my hand ? That's what gives you a headache. No, darling... you give me a headache. - You almost crashed ! - Would you like to drive ? Very funny. Leave me alone if you want to get to Los Angeles tonight. Keep driving, we don't need company. What are you doing ? I'd like to see you off the road in a place like this. I bet you would. - My car went off... - We'll send the police for you. No, get in. We're going south. Thanks a lot. Can you wait while I turn off my radio ? Okay. Take your time. My name's Konitz, Adam Konitz. - What happened to your hand ? - That's my business. You have to excuse my husband, he's got no manners at all. But then, I expect you noticed. He's also suspicious, but pay no attention to him. My wife loves picking up strange men. She's a little bit... of a whore. You may have noticed. The name's Walter Mancini, my wife, Eve. - Eve ? - Yes, why ? Well... Adam and Eve... But this isn't the Garden of Eden, that's too bad... Very funny. We have a comic in the car. It'll be a great trip. Relax now, Kuntz, or whatever your name was... - Konitz. - Konitz, yes. - Don't keep the conversation going. - Okay, Martini. - Or whatever your name was. - Mancini. Yeah... but I dig conversation. Very interesting, so do I: my conversation ! Okay Mancini, have it your way. Because I really dig my conversation. The robber, an ex-convict the police have identified as Carl Holsen, is undergoing emergency surgery at Fresno's Central Hospital. It is not known if can speak and revealed his accomplices' names to the police... - Doesn't the radio bother you ? - Less than he does. Eyewitnesses report there were four holdup men and two getaway cars: a white Pontiac convertible and a gray Chrysler, heading south. It is presumed they will try to cross the border to Mexico... Hey, Fresno is not so far away from here, let's go take a look. What for ? You could write an article on it. In Italy there are 100 robberies a day, a kidnapping a week, a political scandal every month, and a government crisis once a year. Who gives a damn about this ! Show my daddy that as well as making out expense accounts, you can write articles too. The doctor said he has a tired heart. We don't want to shock him, could be dangerous. - You a reporter ? - Ha... What are you ? Traveling salesman, I'm on my way to San Diego to meet my boss. Let me tell you something, never marry the boss' daughter. No worries. You're a loser before you start, they'll say you married your father-in-law's money, and if you have ambition, nobody takes you seriously anymore. You never had ambition. You see ? So you decide it's better not to give a damn and live off your rich father-in-law. Please, Walter. - Isn't that why you married me ? - No ! That was the second reason. - Wonder what the first reason was. - Shall I tell him ? - I'll tell him if you want. - Let me see if I can guess... Because you're such a good lay. So good I'd like to fuck you. Stop the car ! Get out ! Get out, you bastard ! Go, take your bag and go ! You think you're pretty smart ? I'll teach you to keep your mouth shut ! Stop it, enough ! Keep out of this. I'll kill you ! Okay Martini, or whatever your fucking name is... the honeymoon's over. What can I do against a man with a gun who was driving a white Pontiac ? You're smart, I'm one of them. Then you also realize that I know how... to use this gun. I wasn't so wrong when I said she's a good lay ! A great lay ! In the car ! Move it ! Newsflash: the robber has died, the identity of the accomplices is still unknown, police are investigating the robbers circles in hopes of finding a more substantial lead for the case. Roadblocks have been set up on roads leading to Mexico. A Gastex spokesman revealed that the amount stolen... Turn it off ! ...was over 2 million dollars meant for payroll. What are you doing ? - Getting a drink. - Ask first next time. Help yourself, Kuntz. Konitz. Please try and remember. Ladies first ! Didn't anybody teach you manners ? The lady doesn't drink. So many good qualities... I'll take that. I run the bar here like everything else. Now listen to me. We'll run into roadblocks, but no sweat... Because they're looking for 4 men, so we'll disappoint them. We're just 3 happy people returning from vacation. Walter and Eve, the loving couple, and Adam, their friend. So if you behave, we won't have any problems. Do you understand me ? Do you understand me ?! Yes, yes. Can I smoke ? Help yourself. Light one for me too. Thank you... - Which way ? - Left. Hope there's a gas station, we have to fill up soon. I'll tell you when to stop. I've been on this road a hundred times, I know it like the back of my hand. There's a gas station 30 miles ahead. Please, leave me alone, or we'll go off the road. Sensitive, huh ? You're still thinking about it... about when I touched you. You liked it, you keep thinking about it. Well if you're a good girl, I may even do it again. Easy, Martini. If I want to fuck her, I'll fuck her, there's nothing you can do about it. You're nothing without that gun. And what do you think you are, Norman Mailer ? You're a loser living off his wife's money. Ever since you picked me up you've been squabbling, how come you get bent out of shape when I say something nice to her ? Be careful now ! Act natural, we'll be fine. Smart, reporter. Very smart. Hear me, lady ? Start pulling over. Stop before the intersection. What's up, Officer ? Nothing, just a routine check. I'm an Italian journalist. My name is Mancini. My wife and I are on vacation. Is anything wrong ? We're returning from a camping trip, been driving since morning, and our radio's broken... Are you looking for someone ? We haven't seen a soul in all these hours, it's a true and tried desert, Officer. Okay, move on. Get off of me ! Dumb bastards ! Start the car, hurry up ! Or you'll end up the same way. Please, don't shoot ! Don't shoot ! Calm down, just calm down ! Let go ! I'll keep my eye on you, Martini. You're pretty clever. Yeah, so clever... you almost got us killed 1 "Act natural, Eve. We'll be fine". - The big hero. - You don't get it... He is clever, it was a really good try. If that stupid cop had played his part right, I wouldn't have noticed a thing. And we'd be traveling with an invisible escort. My head. My head right in the scopes of their high precision carbines. Some of those bastards can shoot a dime at 100 meters ! I would've been screwed. You underestimated me... You underestimated me, didn't you ? - I underestimated you. - I'm clever too. Much more than you. So don't ever say I'm nothing again, do you hear ? Do you want to know the real difference between you and me ? Look, look ! Look. Bet you've never seen anything like this, 2 million dollars. And know who it belongs to? Me! You're a loser, always have been, always will be. That's the difference between you and me. Yeah... 2 million dollars can turn any shit into a big man. You got a way with words, reporter. It's your business. In my business, I don't need any words. I got a friend here... says everything loud and clear. How many people have you convinced with your friend's help ? Hey, don't start preaching to me. Those two dead cops are on your conscience. It's like you killed them with your own hands. You're right, Konitz, once again. - You could've got us all killed. - So what ? When he doesn't need us anymore, when we reach the Mexican border, he's gonna kill us anyway. Right, Konitz ? There's an intersection in a mile, turn right. - Got anymore to drink ? - No, Christ ! Don't get mad, we'll get gas and whiskey. Pay attention, Eve. When we reach the rest stop, buy two cartons of cigarettes and two bottles of scotch. Wish I was that 50 ! Konitz the Great, Superman Konitz. Shut up ! Know what, reporter ? I'm beginning to like you too. Fill it up. Check the water and oil too. - Shall I go in now ? - Yes. But be careful, stay in sight, don't go near the telephone. When you talk to the guy keep your face turned towards me at all times. We don't need any more trouble. How long you been married ? 9 years. 9 years... what a drag. Got any kids ? Mind your own damn business. Don't react to what I say, please. When we drive away call the police and tell them... We're in trouble... Whiskey and cigarettes. Listen reporter, I've got an idea. Got an idea ? Terrific. What if I hire you ? - If you what ? - If I hire you... to work for me, regular pay and everything. Who do I have to kill ? You don't have to kill anybody, I want you to write a book. And I'll pay you. $50,000 ? $100,000 ? Sound good ? Come with me to Mexico, all expenses paid and 100,000. We'll have a ball ! And we can take Eve along if you like. If not, we can send her home to daddy. What book ? About me. No, about this whole thing. Who do you think you are, Al Capone ? Dillinger ? You're a cheap killer, nobody's interested in your story. But they are in yours. You're a reporter something wild happened to. You're looking for a scoop to get out of this shit, well...? Here's your scoop. Look at me. I'm your scoop ! - Keep the change. - Thanks. So is it a deal ? Okay... Would you mind telling me what's going on ? Why would you want to do this ? To see your name printed in a book ? The news reports aren't enough ? You want the dignity of a literary character too ? What do you mean ? Sometimes I just don't understand you ! I'm doing it because... if anything happens... I want people to know my reasons. - What are you two talking about ? - You'll tell them. I'll tell them but nobody will buy the book. - What book ? - Why not ? A story with sex and blood. Me, my wife, and the killer. By Walter Mancini. We haven't seen much sex yet but... I'll take care of that eventually. No doubt... it'll make a lot of money ! Maybe they'll make it into a movie ! What book, what movie ? Will you explain ! What is this nonsense ? Don't you realize he's mad ? I must pretend I'm interested. It's our hope for coming out alive. Is it too tight ? Are you done playing nurse ? Good... go get the tape recorder then get that gilded ass in the kitchen and fix some food, I'm getting very hungry. - Well... what's taking so long ? - Here. Eve baby, stay where I can see you. Are you ready ? Where do we begin ? We usually begin with the parents. A lousy childhood, an alcoholic father who beats his son and wife, perhaps bad blood: syphilis. Bad friends. The first small crime. An apple because you're hungry. The reformatory, etc. Or if you prefer, an unemployed father. Who's sick or a disabled veteran. So we can blame society, the establishment. A mother who is forced to hustle to buy food and keep her son in college. But his classmates call him "son of a bitch !" and they're right. He beats someone up and gets expelled and sent to reformatory. Are you happy with that ? - Are you listening, Konitz ? - No... You're all wrong. You're off track, reporter. My father worked for the post office, he was a lovely man. He saved everything, even the house I was born in was ours, a nice house ! All paid for with his hard-earned savings. A gingerbread house with white curtains and doilies on the table, made by my mother. Poor mom, never thought of anything except the house. But they really dug each other. And dug me too. Nobody ever yelled or raised a finger. Two really sweet people. I never had problems with those two. Two angels. Two nags... Well, Freud is no help. Clear off the table while I tie him up. Tie me up, why ? Hear what I said ? Hurry up ! Look Walter, I'm sorry but I've got to get some sleep. So be a good boy and put your hands behind the chair. - You're hurting me. - Oh yeah ? Hey girl with the gilded ass, bring me a drink. Leave her alone, son-of-a-bitch ! It's for the book, Walter. It needs sex... sex and blood. If I don't give you something to write about... how are we going to have a best-seller ? The only thing I'll write for you is your obituary. Leave her alone, I said ! Hi, folks ! My name is Oaks. That's Hod. We were friends of that Judas there. Where's the money ? Oaks, I found the suitcase. - Is it all there ? - Sure is ! Untie me, quick. What are you doing ? Let me kill them right away. Then we can split. Don't be stupid, you need us, like Konitz did. We'll help you get to the border. The same plan we had with him. It'd be silly to kill us. Shut up ! Now listen for Christ's sake, don't get so upset. He's right, Adam wasn't stupid. They can cover for us till we get to the border. Then we kill them. Listen to me. Trust me. Excuse my friend, he's a bit sensitive, with all that's happened he's all shook up. What are you waiting for ? Untie me. My hand is hurt. Sure. Sure. When we're in Mexico, Oaks... you won't send for Kate, will you ? You won't have her come ? Sweetheart I told you, she's the mother of my kids. I don't give a shit about your kids. I warned you, Oaks. Look, she doesn't mean a damn thing to me. I'll kill her. I warned you, Oaks. I'll kill that whore. - Listen Walter... - I don't feel like talking. We have to talk and discuss this. What the...? He's crazy. Let him pass. There's no room ! Stay in the center of the road. What does that son-of-a-bitch want from us ? Speed up, damn it ! - He stopped ? - I don't know. I can't see. God, no ! Where's my gun ? My gun... where's my fucking gun ? Stop it ! No ! What does he want ? Stop the car ! Help ! I'll kill him ! 80 help me God, I'll kill that son-of-a-bitch ! Quiet. Easy... Come on. Calm down. It's over now. Start driving. Watch out ! Son-of-a-bitch ! You son-of-a-bitch, I'll kill you ! Come out of there now ! Hod ! Hod... Please, Hod ! Come on, get up. Hold it, reporter. Surprise ! That fag didn't kill me. And he thought he had... I played dead and fooled you. Now that's not a typewriter... I'll write that you're immortal... a real hero. Yeah. - What's the matter with her ? - She fainted. Come on. Go on. Adam... - He's alive ! - So I see. Help, do something, Adam. Help me get him to a hospital. I don't want the money or anything, I just want... Pull yourself together. Don't worry. We'll save your honey. Thank you, Adam ! I'll never forget this. Never mind... - Is he able to walk ? - Yes. - Can you get him on his feet ? - He can walk. Don't just stand there, help him ! No, to the truck. To the truck ! Bye, reporter, don't worry, I told you I liked you. You can go, the border is nearby. I'm firing you before you even start ! You should stay right here until we're far away. Oaks, get in. It was nice meeting you, Kuntz, of whatever your name is. - Adam, what about the money ? - Shit, I nearly forgot. I'll go get it. What are you doing, Adam ?! Bye, faggots ! Freeze. It seems... you're really into being a martyr, aren't you, reporter ? Go fuck yourself, murderer. The girl with the golden ass, fancy meeting you here. Drive. I remember the time dad found $20 extra in his pay envelope, what a weekend ! He and mom discussed it, whispering like scared rabbits, whether to give the money back or not. 20 fucking dollars... Monday morning bright and early he goes to the office with the 20 dollars, his eyes shiny and proud. Doing his duty like a model employee. You know something ? The week before I asked him for 5 fucking dollars to buy a football, that football was important to me. Know what he said ? "Use your allowance, son". Allowance, my foot... He gave me 2 lousy bucks a week. 2 lousy bucks a week ! What do you think of that ? Your hard-time story wouldn't make old ladies cry. Most people are on your father's side because they're like him, they're the ones who buy books. You think so ? - Here. - Thanks. - So then you began to steal ? - That very night. While the bastard slept I stole $20 from his wallet, what a laugh... It took them 2 days to figure it out ! The first time you killed someone, was it amusing ? - Don't get moral on me. - I don't give a fuck about morals. - I'm just interviewing you. - Yeah ? Well, I figured something out. Killing people is like building up debts. The more debts you build up, the more respect you have. You didn't figure anything out. Big guys don't shoot people like you do. Oh no ? What do they do ? They steal with the help of the law, ever hear of that ? Yeah, and marry the boss' daughter too ? You're a cheap killer, Konitz. One day an idiot policeman will get you, or a cheap killer will gun you down ! - That's how you'll end up. - Shut up ! I can guarantee it. - You're a dead man... - I don't want to hear it ! Enough! Stop it ! I can't stand it anymore ! End of the interview. Start the car ! Take that road. Get out. Why are we here ? Don't ask stupid questions. A perfect spot for an execution. Is this where you'll kill us ? You, in the trailer. - Why ? - Don't argue. Move it ! Get your gilded ass in there. Don't be stupid, reporter. Just like I promised... Get up and fix me something to eat. Police have identified the man killed in the white Pontiac: Robert Finnegan, a 41-year-old Irish man who made headlines last year after escaping from a hospital for the criminally insane. Two other men escaped with him and are still at large: Lewis Hod, age 23, black hair, 59" and... Not interested in knowing the other names ? As if I didn't know already. Hod and Oaks. Oaks and Hod. The inseparable fags. The honeymoon couple. Right, Hod and Oaks. Did you ever notice, only homosexuals know what real love is. Oh Jesus... that's great Mancini. You're really great. I'm not joking. It's a real mess: men on one side, women on the other. A society of homosexuals. Haven't you noticed ? You don't understand, do you ? It's true, you're all a bunch of damn fags ! Speak for your husband. No, you're included too. What do you think you are, big fucker ? He just uses my body to jerk off, right Walter ? And you make love with that gun. Don't you ? I bet every time you shoot you feel more virile, more manly. Don't move, I'm gonna give you a front-row seat because it's show time, buddy, aren't you excited ? Want a drink ? Maybe you need one. How about you ? Come here. You liked it, didn't you ? I mean, you really liked it ! Call me a fag now... Reporter, bet you never made her moan like that ! All you have to do is know how to touch her. She would keep on going ! You just can't get enough. Maybe I'll take you with me ! Sound good ? She's like a wind-up toy. Turn the key and turn her on ! You're mad, Konitz. I feel sorry for you. There's nothing you can do about it. You're sick. Blah, blah... talk, talk... You were in such a hurry to turn off the radio before they could say the other name of the third man who escaped from the asylum. - It was you, wasn't it ? - Cool it, Mancini ! You're a mental cripple, you need to humiliate people, everyone you meet: me, her... I got you shook up, Martini. Definitely shook up. She doesn't look humiliated to me. Go ahead, tell him. Tell him how you really feel. Let's go inside, it's cold. Hey, reporter ! Well, it's been real nice knowing you, but even nicer... knowing your wife. Too bad we couldn't get that book together... but I'll be in Mexico tomorrow with only one problem: how to spend 2 million dollars. So I guess it's goodbye. If I hadn't shot him he would've killed us. Yes, he would've killed us. Why don't you make some coffee, we both need it. We must go to the police and tell them everything, they'll understand. I'll be right back. It's pointless, it's stupid. Questions, interrogations, statements, more statements, we'd have to repeat it over and over. - Walter, how can we just... - We don't have to tell anyone. Nobody knows we met him. Two policemen are dead. His accomplices are dead. All we have to do is get away from here. As if nothing had ever happened, Eve. Out. Walter, the money ! What about it ? What do you mean ? What do you mean, Walter ? I mean we've got 2 million dollars, a lot of things can fit into 2 million dollars... - Beautiful things ! - You're crazy. It's Gastex's money, Walter. You want me to worry about the future of Gastex ? You're talking nonsense, you can't understand ! - What can't I understand ? - Shut up ! The salaries will be paid, the insurance will cover them, Insurance companies are covered by the premiums people pay to be insured. It's a damn chain of speculation, enormous profits, made with your money and mine, and millions of idiots like us. We're not stealing from just anyone but from thieves ! Gastex ! For years I paid for gas at their prices, so now I'm collecting a refund. If they don't find the money they'll keep looking for it, it'll never end. Let them look for it. They won't come and ask us. What do we know about it ? Who saw us ? - Do you understand now ? - You're so smart. Very smart. Shit. Now what ? Step on the gas. Not like that, gently. - You're making it worse like that. - Don't yell at me ! Start gently, then step on the gas. - What's wrong ? - I think the battery's dead. Now what'll we do ? Time to give up. Want me to do what Konitz's father did ? Go to Gastex clutching my suitcase and say: "Gentlemen, Santa Claus made a bookkeeping error, I found an extra 2 million in my stocking !" - Want me to do that ? - You sound just like Konitz. But very soon we'll be rich and happy. - "Girl with the gilded ass"... - Don't ever say that again ! No ? No ? No, little mouse... Don't touch me ! Don't touch me ! Stop, shut up. Señor, what happened ? My car's stuck in the sand and we have motor problems. You are in serious trouble. Tell me, how'd you get to this place ? By accident. We were looking for a place to stay alone for the night, we're going home from Nevada. I'm an Italian journalist, Mancini, this is my wife, Eve. Honored, senor, my name is Mendoza. We're lucky you came along. Maybe you can help us get out of here. Maybe... Can you help us get to a garage ? I'll pay you for your trouble if you tow us. A garage around here ? There's only one makeshift mechanic a few miles away. He's gotten my Poncho Villa out of trouble a few times. - Who ? - That's my truck. - I'll get the cables. - Thanks so much. Give back that money. - No such thing. - Give it to the police. It's mine ! If I don't keep it I'll lose respect for myself. That's my payment for damages. Oh yes, sure, I understand now. Your pride is wounded because someone laid your wife. You're a good lay, like Konitz said, a great lay. But my God, Eve, you don't think you're worth 2 million dollars ? Thank you. See them ? They look like they just argued. They must be rich with that fancy camper. They don't fuck ! Yeah, I bet that's their problem ! - Finished ? - Yes. - How much ? - 5 dollars. Mr. Rockefeller, buy us poor kids some food ? And some smokes ? - Try to earn what you eat. - How ? By doing what ? - Working, for example. - Working ? - Could you translate that ? - Don't be tight, Walter. You're a millionaire. Keep the change. The lady's very nice. The lady's a good Samaritan, She gives the thirsty drinks, never leaves a hitch-hiker on foot, she encourages the young to beg, she loves her fellow man but not her husband ! - Give me a drink. - Here's mud in your eye. Like the old days... - When are we going to get rid... - Of Konitz's body ? - Not yet. - But this is dangerous ! - I said not yet. - Why ? Leave it to me, Christ ! What is it ? Hey ! Hey bastards ! Hey, Mr. Millionaire. So we gotta go to work, huh ? Take this ! You little criminals ! Up yours, asshole ! If you didn't pay attention to every son-of-a-bitch you meet... You'd have 2 million dollars less. Let's stop here. Pete, see if they're coming. Okay. - Is this enough ? - Yes. Hurry up. - Coming yet ? - Almost. Here we go... Over there too. - What if the bills are marked ? - You're getting used to it ! - It doesn't disgust you anymore ? - I never said it disgusted me. - I said it frightened me. - I know how to change it. - You know everything... - Yes ! Despite what you and your father think, I am bright. Hey... they're coming. Sons-of-bitches ! How's it going, Millionaire ? How much ? 300 bucks ! Not bad ! What idiots, my God, what idiots ! Help. Help ! Help me... Please... Poor Eve, I'll be right back. I'm a lousy reporter and you're the big brain, huh ? I'm the big brain, not you, you asshole ! It's strange, Eve, very strange. I'd been thinking about it for hours but didn't know how to do it, how to get rid of you. Those idiots solved the problem for me. Trying to start all over again would be useless, all we ever do is fight. Believe me, this is the best way. I told you that I knew exactly what I was doing. Understand why I waited to get rid of him ? I would've organized something like this in 10-15 miles. Goodbye, Eve. Goodbye. THE COUPLE ISN'T THE PROBLEM, THE PROBLEM IS THE MAN AND THE WOMAN. THE ONLY SOLUTION IS DEATH.
