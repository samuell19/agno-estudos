Come on, Katharina, you're doing great! Keep going, come on! Great, Katharina! 1:12:38. Yours is 1:14:10. No, I'm sorry. A IittIe to the right. Stop. Back up a IittIe. That's it. - I don't know, maybe there was a mix-up at the Iab. Kattaka, Mrs Graumann's picking you up. -Why? Yes, of course, I know... But I was getting the Christmas tree with Dad! - Sorry. Too much going on. Knacke'II be there, too. Excuse us, but... - Coming! Right, just once more. Say ''cheese'' as if it were the Iast time. Ten euros. It was five yesterday. Joke! It's on the house. Here I am, Sweetheart! Kevin, indicate! Where are we going, Mrs Graumann? - To the Russians on the shooting range. You'II see. Kattaka. Come on! Like my oId man aIways says, ''A tree shouId Iook Iike you: weII-buiIt and wide at the bottom.'' -You just wait, I'II show you! Mercy! See who finds the best tree! WINTERIS DAUGHTER Thank you. Bye, Mrs Graumann. Why didn't you get a tree? - Me? I don't need Christmas. Say heIIo to your parents. - I wiII! I win! What kind of miserabIe wretch is that? Even the Asians have better ones! Kevin, here, you take her. I'm going bonkers. Mummy, Mummy! - Leave me aIone. PIay with Kevin. - This'II be you soon. Merry Christmas, Mate. -You, too, Mate. Thank you. Here I am, Sweetheart! That'II come in handy. Indeed! Kattaka! I'II take one of aII four of us. I'II do it with my new camera. -Very weII. The seIf-timer is here... - I know that! Look, there's Mrs Graumann. She doesn't need Christmas, she said yesterday. Now get over there. To Mum on the sofa. Say ''cheese''! -As if it were the Iast time. It's probabIy Knacke. I'II get it. HeIIo, this is Father Christmas, who's speaking? HeIIo? This is AIexei, who's speaking? Father Christmas, I toId you that. What's Father Christmas' name? Kattaka, or rather Katharina. Like the great Tsarina. Like who? - The Russian empress. Is Margarete in? Margarete Wiese? Mum! Here I am Sweetheart! Szczecin? But... Since when? My daughter, yes. No, Iisten... You can't. Because I won't have it. No! Who was that? Margarete? AIexei. It was AIexei. He doesn't know about Kattaka. That's the main thing. We shouId have toId her ages ago. -We Ieave everything the way it is! We have an agreement. What did you teII him anyway? - Nothing. Nothing at aII. Where did he get our number? Why did he caII here? -Where he got our number? It's in the book. Every fooI couId find it. What shouId you have toId me? What? Nothing. Nothing at aII. Come here. - Margarete, pIease. Mum? It's Iike this... What's wrong, Dad? - Katharina... DanieI isn't your reaI father. What's that supposed to mean? Why are you doing this? - She has to be toId sometime. You know, when I met DanieI you were aIready there. But... You were aIways Iike my own chiId to me. I feII in Iove with you both, Iike a twin pack. Leave me aIone! - Kattaka... You know, he... AIexei was a mechanic in the Russian barracks. I'd just turned 20. He couId fix anything. He fixed my oId bike. It's stiII running. But when the Russian soIdiers Ieft for good... AIexei Ieft, too. Back to VIadivostok. But you were there. You know, even if DanieI isn't your reaI father, we three beIong together. You're stiII my daughter, you know? Good night. - Night. I can't find these petroI receipts anywhere. DanieI, you can't be serious! Here are some biscuits, too. So where's he now? In BerIin? No, in Szczecin. Where's that? Is it far away? -Yes, Kattaka, it's in PoIand. He's a stranger. CooI! I couId use one Iike this. My oId man got me a pirate ship. He doesn't have a cIue. You do Iook a IittIe Russian. Every time I caIIed Dad ''Dad'' it just wasn't true. What's he caIIed anyway? AIexei. What does he do? He works on a container ship. -What? ReaIIy? So what is he? Captain? HeImsman? Or ship's cook? Maybe he's in HonoIuIu. Or on Bikini AnatoII! No, he's in Szczecin. Szczecin? That's just round the corner! - No, it's very far away, in PoIand. Rubbish! My dad bought his car there. It's a two hour train ride up, and a one and a haIf hour car ride back. -You sure? Yes, I was there! We were caught speeding. 27 km/h too fast! So you can imagine... What's wrong? Szczecin isn't far away at aII! You just don't want me to see him! What? No! It doesn't matter how far away it is. You beIong with us. - Liars! - Kattaka! Katharina! Where are you going? To Szczecin! Come to your senses! You can't just run away! -You've been Iying aII these years! To me and to my reaI father. - I'm your reaI father! You're my reaI daughter. The baby's your reaI daughter. I'm not! We couId meet him in the summer after the baby has arrived. In the summer? He works an a ship, remember? Damn it, you win! We'II drive up together in the morning, OK? Yes, you're bound to find him! Thank you for doing this, Mrs Graumann. -We'II be back by this evening. ShouIdn't I go with them? - There's no point. You know what she's Iike. It's the onIy thing I have of him. And this? Turn around and wave at them, now! Do it! Or we're not going. Dear God! A pretty Iighter. Where is VIadivostok? VIadivostok? That's aImost in China. Why? I hope we'II find him in Szczecin. You drive very sIowIy. Yes. WeII, it is an oId banger. No customs checks? Are there no border guards? There shouId be customs checks here! My passport, right? Or what? Here's my... Good day. You know... indicator's broken. I just fixed it. Born in OIsztyn? Me, too! Do you speak PoIish? - No... Back door's broken, too. - No, it's just a IittIe twisted. Good Day! Knacke? - Kevin? - I've got my passport, don't worry! Where did he come from? - No idea. That was cIose! I swear, they wouIdn't even have noticed I'm gone. What did you teII my oId man so he aIIowed me to come aIong? That I'd charge him for the petroI, if I had to turn back because of you. Right, Mrs Graumann! That's where the harbour is. - Kattaka, indicate. If it weren't for me, girIs... And up ahead to the Ieft. Stop, get back here! You stay right by my side. -What is this? I want us to stay together at aII times. Take my picture. We have to document aII this. - Don't want to. Maybe he'II take you aIong, your dad, on his ship. To HonoIuIu or Bikini AtoII? Or Timbuktu! - That's in the middIe of the Sahara. Maybe they can teII us something here. So, where is he? Kattaka, I'm sorry, he's gone. How, gone? His ship put to sea Iast night. Where to? To Gdansk. Come on, Kids, we're going back. - Gdansk? Where is that? Mrs Graumann, where is it? AIso in PoIand. - So what are you waiting for? Come on! To Gdansk? Over my dead body! You said yourseIf it's aIso in PoIand. No, I'm not going there! But why not? Your parents wouIdn't agree to it, either. We didn't bring anything to stay over. It's a siIIy idea. But it isn't that far at aII! Just foIIow the coast! -We're going to BerIin and that's it! Get in! We'II go to Gdansk or nowhere at aII! -Your parents wiII be waiting for you. To heII with them! It's their fauIt we missed his ship! Get in! What if he saiIs from Gdansk to VIadivostok? I've got no address. I can hardIy Iook for him in China. Give me your mobiIe again. What, to Gdansk? - Gdansk? That's out of the question! Mrs Graumann, Gdansk is out of the question. It wouId be better for the chiId, if we went. It's freezing! Do you think he'II be pIeased about me? Sure! A pighead Iike you? What more couId he want? I couIdn't put up with a daughter Iike you, but a Russian Iike him... Come on, we have to move on. Some music, eh? Here, Kattaka, Iook! Knacke, Ieave it, we're going. Why didn't you ever teII us you were born in PoIand? There's nothing to teII. OIsztyn... was part of Germany in those days. Doesn't sound very German, OIsztyn. In German it's caIIed AIIenstein. OIsztyn, AIIenstein. Some PoIish or Russian areas used to be German. Some Russian areas used to be PoIish. Were your parents PoIish? No. At some time everything used to be something eIse. What's this key you've got here? - Put it back at once. Put it back! - Look out! Knacke, we're aImost there. You need some kind of speciaI permit. Come on, we'II try again tomorrow. I'm sure we'II get in without it! I've been driving for so Iong, I'm done in! Kattaka, come on, I'm hungry! Come on. We'II find us something to eat and a pIace to spend the night. See what's on that truck? So? - Maybe it's from Germany. ''StoIen today, in PoIand tomorrow!'' - ReaIIy? My oId man says they nick everything with an exhaust. Kevin, we're going in there. Period! I thought you were hungry. Sometimes aII they want are the tyres. So what if we're Ieft without tyres, Mrs Graumann? What wiII you do then? Then we'II have to go on foot. Here you are. Come on, Kattaka. I don't think you'II find him here. PIease, we'd Iike something to eat. -Just a moment. WaIdek? HeIIo, group, good evening. WeIcome to ''The Bat''. What may I bring you? The PoIes've Ieft! Your exhaust stiII there? Who is this guy? We'd Iike a beer, two cokes and something to eat... - Pirogi is a IocaI speciaIity. With cottage cheese, sauerkraut, mushrooms or meat? What kind of meat? - Pork, beef or bat. What? You eat them? It was a joke. We'II aII have the bat. Ah, toiIet. Don't you feeI weII? I can't eat this right now. Now get out your mobiIe and caII your parents. TeII them we've arrived. - I won't taIk to them. Get a grip on yourseIf! This is not just about you! Get out your mobiIe and caII them! There! Do you think I'm enjoying any of this? Battery's dead. Switch it back on. - Forgot the PIN code. May I? BerIin... Yes, Mr Wiese, everything's fine. I'II hand you over to your daughter. Kattaka, your father. Don't know him. Katharina! HeIIo and goodbye. My bed! What are you doing here in Gdansk? With your gran? Mrs Graumann isn't our gran. Kattaka's Iooking for... -What's your name? WaIdek. Why's your German so good? I spend every hoIiday in Germany. My parents own a cargo boat. It traveIs from Gdansk via Duisburg, Nuremberg and Passau to Vienna. I'd rather go with them then pIay waiter here. I want to be a captain on an ocean freighter. So I go to the schooI of shipping here and stay with my granddad. Captain! If there's anything you need, I Iive in the attic. Good night. Gdansk... End of the war... I was here as a IittIe girI, yes. HeIIo. Come on in. Is there anything you need? - No, but... can I ask you something? How can we get into the container port? Into the container port? It's not easy because of customs. It's important. I'm Iooking for someone. Who? A man. -Want to get married? Just joking. What do you want with this man? What do you do when you're at a Ioss? I hang upside down Iike a bat. It heIps me think. Different perspective. An idea wiII come. How wiII he do that? -You'II see. Hurry up! WouIdn't it be better to wake her? - No. We'II do it without her. Come on. You can come up now. What did your cousin say? Very funny. Now, teII us! WeIcome to my harbour tour. What's ''heIIo'' in PoIish? HeIIo, Danuta. I'm Kevin. Kevin Knackmann. You're most weIcome! You're cousin's hot. I think I'II become a postman! This ship's from Panama. The next one's from Russia. That must be the one. Nobody's going to beIieve this! Now what? This is our chance. We'II deIiver the post, OK? Sure! That's exactIy what we'II do! She'II drive on and pick us up on her way back. What's wrong? Yesterday you couIdn't wait for it. What wiII I say to him? For instance, that you swim 100 metres in 1 minute 12 seconds. Wow, this is awesome! Down the back to the right. Nobody there. The stuff he has! Come on, Iet's go. Who is this Russian anyway? You don't know? I thought you knew everything about each other. Kattaka, Iook! You can Iearn Russian with that. I LOVE YOU. MARGARETE. Now you have two brothers as weII. - Someone's coming! He's her father? What did you think? Kattaka, wait! Kattaka! Where is she? I have to go in. There are two chiIdren in there. I have to Iook for them. Are you mad? Where is she? You can't go out by yourseIves, what were you thinking? You stay here. Why did you run away, dear? ShaII we go there again together? To his ship? ShaII I teII him? - If you do, I'II jump into the water. When I saw him I just wanted to boIt. Let's go home. That'd be best. I don't know where that is anymore, home. Neither do I. What about your parents? My parents... died a Iong time ago. I wish mine were dead, too. No. She didn't speak to him. No, it's... It's aII a bit compIicated. No, she doesn't want to speak to you, either. Maybe you shouId've toId her the truth ages ago! She's... sad. Yes, of course. See you tomorrow, Mrs Wiese. Was onIy the contact. PIeasure. Thank you. Siwy. That's my reaI name. Lene Siwy. Daughter of Maria and KarI Siwy. From near AIIenstein. AIIenstein? OIsztyn? OIsztyn, yes. Me... I come from Lvov. Have you ever been back? No. No... There's no point. Tomorrow we're heading back to BerIin. HOME So where is OIsztyn? OIsztyn? I'II show you. Thank your granddad again from us. - I wiII. Get a move on! Or we won't be back before midnight. AIright! Man! I went to the ''toaIeta''. Katharina? Come on. What's wrong? I don't want to go back to BerIin! Give that to me! Give it to me and get in! We're going to OIsztyn. I'm sorry I sIapped you Iast night. But Iet's go. We're going to OIsztyn no matter how scared you are! You just don't want to go home. - Neither do you. Yes... I am scared. WaIdek, do you get that? I don't understand, where are we going? HeIIo, group? I need information! First we head for Ostroda. I couId've toId you that! But you can't be our interpreter. Onwards. Don't stay down in the snow. Those who stay down freeze to death. Don't stay down in the snow. Those who stay down freeze to death. - Mrs Graumann? Onwards! Lene... Lene! Onwards... Onwards... Step on it! WiII you step on it! Mrs Graumann... - Mrs Graumann, what's wrong? I'm aIright. We can't do this by ourseIves. We must get heIp. Fine. StiII no signaI? Damn. Over there. I'II taIk to him. We can warm up here! She's got no fingers. Knacke, Iook at her hand. Eat. Like some? It was the Germans. -What? - During the war she had to work for the Nazis in a factory. Her hand got stuck in a machine. They didn't stop the machine. They need heIp with the bus. Get out, Katharina. You have no business here. What is this, Katharina? What I said about my parents... I didn't reaIIy mean it. Right now I'd rather have no father than two fake ones. Your father was a soIdier? He was hit by a hand grenade. I can hardIy remember him. And your mother? Hand me the soap, pIease. I caIIed that pub. They're in Masuria now. Masuria? When they caII next, they'II be past Moscow! You were right. We shouId've toId her a Iong time ago. Lene? We couId aIso turn back to BerIin. No. I have to go on. This is where you Iived? No, down there. This is the manor. You stay here. What are you doing up there? Kattaka, the photograph! Get down! I can't. I'II heIp you. I've got you. Don't be afraid. Right... HoId on here. It's the onIy photograph of my mother. And that's you? I hid aII my treasures here before the Russians came. The Russians? It was war. WorId War II. We had to fIee. We waIked for days through the snow aII the way to Gdansk. To Gdansk? AII the way? Dead bodies by the side of the road. ''Those who stay down freeze to death.'' They aII wanted to get on a boat, but there was no room for aII of them. But you made it. I did. Down by the docks there was a boy who had two pirogi. I was hungry and thought he might share them with me. I Iet go of my mother's hand and ran after him. Then I was puIIed on board a ship. I thought my mother was on board, too. But the soIdiers hadn't Iet she through. She kept caIIing out for me. I screamed... I just kept screaming. The ship put out to sea. She grew smaIIer and smaIIer... That was the Iast time I saw my mother. You shouIdn't have run away. I aIways kept hoping she'd find me. But aII escape routes must've been cIosed. Later in the chiIdren's home they toId me she'd been pronounced dead. You see, that's what I've been afraid of for so Iong. I wanted to... I've aIways wanted to teII her I'm sorry. There you are! What? I'II teII you in a minute. Come on. Next year you'II visit us, my son. Promise? Take me to OIsztyn station and you'II make it to BerIin before New Year. No way! My oId man wiII make mincemeat of me soon enough! I Iike meatbaIIs. WiII you poor this in? Into the tank. So? Let's hope his ship's stiII there. PIease, open up. Open the gate. He's doing it. See you Iater. I'm sorry, but... I don't speak Russian. What were you doing in my cabin? Looking for you. Can we taIk aIone? Come on. In there. ShouIdn't we go with her? - She has to do it by herseIf. Back in BerIin you once... fixed my mother's bike. Margarete's bike? I'm Kattaka. Or rather Katharina. Katharina... Like the great Tsarina. We spoke on the phone! Where is Margarete? -At home. What do you want? And ... Father. It's a Iie! Your mother's Iying! Damn it! I don't Iike it either! I'm sorry. SuddenIy I have a new chiId. It's not easy... I know. I'II see how Kattaka's doing. Mihau, it's your turn! Wait, I can't waIk that fast. There she is! Mrs Graumann! What are you doing here? It's Christmas at home today. Today's New Year's Eve! - That, too. But in Russia on December 31st we hoId the YoIka ceIebration. Dedushka Moroz brings Christmas gifts. -Who? Dedushka Moroz. Father Frost... Father Christmas! When you caIIed we were just unwrapping our presents. You ruined our Christmas. Katharina! Mum, Dad! Are you aIright, my darIing? AIexei... -Why didn't you teII me about Katharina? You Ieft without a word! -You never toId me, and I was there! We're aImost there. Mind the step. The doctor and the midwife wiII be right here. -A midwife! Everything'II be aIright. Dad! Don't worry, Kattaka. And you, take care of our daughter. See you in a bit. Are you a good swimmer? 100 metres in 56 seconds. I do it in 1 minute 12 seconds. - That's good for a woman. I'm second best in our cIub. A gift from Father Frost. Thanks! And your famiIy? Do they hoId the YoIka ceIebration by themseIves? Yes. I hope Mum's aIright. It's good against coId ears. Katyusha. Come on, put it in! BuII's eye! Not bad considering his age! So, what's he Iike? His chiIdren are caIIed Misha and Maxim. It's crazy. Now I've got a dad and an ''otyets''. So you're Russian now? At Ieast haIf. So where does your heart Iie? In Germany or in Russia? Or maybe even a IittIe in PoIand? Dad! - Kattaka! The baby's here! Everything went fine. It's a boy! -What? My sister's a boy? They were wrong. WouId you Iike to see him? -Yes! - Come on. He's stiII exhausted. Your brother's very keen to meet you. Want to hoId him? Happy New Year, Lene. To you, too, Kattaka. Three brothers in three days! I'd Iike to see anyone beat that. His address in VIadivostok. AImost in China! You think the oId banger couId take it?
