My parents never really got ints or the holidays or anything, so I was always left up to my own devices for them. - [Audience] Aw. - [Felicia] That's so sad. - Oh, no, no, not at all. My mom is a neurosurgeon and my dad is a scientist. They were just really busy and didn't find the holidays im. I loved planning them so that we could do things together, even if it was only a couple times out of the year. - So you don't spend holidays w? - No, not really. I hosted Friendsgiving at my house this year and I hope to get a Christmas c. - A Christmas client? - What's a Christmas client? - A Christmas client is someone who doesn't have time to decorate for Christmas and lets me plan the event, decorate, and cook for their sm. - So where do you spend it? - That's not really about my bu. - [Felicia] You're right.

You work on your confidence, but that will come with time. - (chuckles) I hate speaking in front of crowds. - [Felicia] Oh well, so do I. - Really? You're such a natural. - (laughing) Oh, not really. I really have to hype myself up for these kinda things. - [Meredith] But you have people eating out of the palm of your . - Hardly. (both chuckling) I like you. - Thanks. You're not so bad yourself.

Call her before 11 and Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas? We've got a few weeks until Chr. - (chuckles) Yes, I know but there's gonna be this whole dump of snow and I am not good in the cold. - But you live in Maine.

His grandfather passed away. - Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Right around the holidays too. (somber music) - It was really sad. He and his grandfather were ver. - I can imagine, inheriting his. But how can I help you? - There is a stipulation to the inheritance. - Oh? - Yes. He must host Christmas for his y and that includes food, decorations, everything. I'll be honest, I love my boss, but he doesn't know the first thing about entertaining. - [Meredith] (chuckles) Well, you're speaking with the right person. - I certainly hope so. It's a lot of work, but it pays. - [Meredith] How many people will be there? - 10 adults.

What about Christmas Eve? - Uh, there are no plans for Christmas Eve, so you could even have the day . But Christmas is non-negotiable. - Okay. Anything else? - (chuckles) Anyone else that I have talked to has all but hung up on me when they found out they had to work Christmas. Do you celebrate the holiday? I mean, you are familiar with Christmas. (chuckles) - (chuckles) Of course I'm familiar with Christmas. I'm familiar with all holidays. And I actually do celebrate Chr, but my parents live in Baltimore so I spend the holidays with fr. I'm sure they'll understand. - That is wonderful to hear. (c) - Great.

So you want this room more eleg? - Yeah, maybe. Something different than the rest of the house. We exchange Christmas gifts in . And it's the first room you see when you walked in so it's a really special room. - I can tell. - And we take our family photos in here too. - I'll make it extra special. - And you don't have to worry about the bedrooms. Maybe something little like a wreath or candles. That's what grandfather used to. - Got it. - Any questions about the rooms you've seen so far? - Nope. I might ask some in the. - I'll be working from home, so I'll be here. - Great. - Now, onto the game room. Follow me. (Chris sighs) Welcome to the game room. - Cozy.

People get lost down here for h. There's a bathroom over there. We usually surface when it's ti. - So you want it decorated, but not too fancy. (light guitar music) - [Chris] Yeah, basically. - Great. Pictures from past holidays will definitely help. - I'll get you the photos by Fr. - [Meredith] Great. - That's the door we use when i. It's easier than climbing the stairs to the front door. And we leave shoes there. That way we're not tracking anything through the house. - Smart. What about a slipper station? - Slipper station? - Yes. A bunch of slippers and fuzzy ss for people to change into when they come in from the snow. - I like that idea. - I'll write out a proposal for. - No need. I trust you. - But you don't even know me. - Yeah, but I can tell you unde, and how important Christmas is to my family.

Okay, look, call them if you think it'll make you fee. - What for? - In case they have special plans for the holidays? You never know. - Right, I guess. - Okay, let me ask you a questi. If you know your parents aren't doing anything for the holidays, would you tak? - Absolutely. - So call them. Just see.
